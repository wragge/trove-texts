A RADICAL REFORM,
“Oh, I ft el so Mondayish !” exclaims the housemother
at her breakfast table on the Monday morning. Although
the above absurd adjective is not to be found in the dic-
tionary, yet every woman well knows its meaning when
she looks forward to the teeming, steaming, boiling, toil-
ing, temper-trying, hateful washing day. The house is
thrown out of joint, other weekly duties are, as far as
possible, set aside, the children kept out of the way, a cold
dinner for the family, and a warm reception for anyone
who intrudes to waste time and to prolong the agony.
Happy, indeed, is the home where “washing day” is a
thing of the past. Every busy, hard-pressed mother
knows the wretchedness and gloom which the present
washing day brings down upon the household. In the
early morning all is prepared for the all important washer-
woman, timed to arrive for an early breakfast, and then
to attack the week or fortnight’s batch of soiled linen.
The good-natured husband readily excuses a hastily-pre-
pared breakfast, for he hopes it may betoken the speedy
ending of the dreadful day. The children are packed off
to school, and then begins in earnest the strife between
the housewife, anxious to get everything finished in good
time, and the professional laundress, equally anxious to
make the work last over two days. With the greatest
impartiality the laundress divides her attention between
the discussion of light refreshments and the very latest
gossip, the intervals of time being filled up with a gentle
application to her special functions
Very many of our valued customers to w hom we have
supplied labor-saving appliances in the past, do their own
washing. In every family, in our climate, frequent
changes of underclothing are necessary. Then there are
the house linen, the cotton dresses, white coats, and
outer garments; and all this is heaped up for the poor
house-mother to cleanse, perhaps with the assistance of a
daughter, if there is one old enough. It is not that the
husband, who also works hard, is unkind. Expenses are
many, economy is imperative, days of depression and of
trouble must be provided against. So the washing is to
be done, and the wife must do it; and after the imperfect
rest of a sultry night, as she gets ready the breakfast upon
a hot Monday morning, she feels for a while that her lot
is cheerless, that the apportionment of toil is beyond her
share and beyond her strength ; that somehow' a change
should be made. No wonder that fair young girls, after a
few' years of married life, become w'orn-lookmg, and that
they age faster than they ought. The husband is w illing
enough to cherish the good wife’s comeliness, and to make
her lot easy, but how' ? She doss not complain, only says
she feels always “tired ”
Now, as purveyors of household implements, w'e have
long seen our opportunity to enlarge our business by
introducing a thoroughly efficient Washing and Mangling
Machine. Both these services must be combined in the
one article. This we have most perfectly and assuredly
accomplished. The demon of the washing day is not
scotched but killed
We resolved to introduce nothing until absolutely certain
by observation, experiment, and test, that the implement
would be a success. There are hosts of Washing Machines.
The vast majority are childish fads, are injurious, or are
useless. We say and we prove that the Beale Patent
Washer will save in labour of w'ashingin proportion as our
Sewing Machines do in sewing. And in a higher degree,
for the washing by hands is so much the more laborious.
The Beale Patent Washer may be described as follows :
The vertical tub is very carefully made, with fluted sides.
It is stationary, only the water and the clothes being
agitated by an accurately shaped “dolly,” which is worked
by a fly-wheel. The clothes are simply dropped in, no
arrangement or packing being wanted. The special
reversing gear moves this dolly sw'iftly backwards and for-
wards, and a very smaM expenditure of strength suffices
to lash the water into a mass of foaming suds. In the
process the clothes are floated to and fro, up and dow r n ;
currents and cross-currents of water are formed, which
meet, and are forced through and through the fabric,
carrying away every particle of dirt and stain. The linen,
being merely suspended in the water, is not rubbed and
scrubbed as in hand-washing. Neither has anything to
submit to the hand-wringing process, which insensibly
rips, tears, and wears the clothes. Thus the most delicate
fabrics cannot be torn by our system of washing. Every-
one has noticed that their clothes seem to be as much
worn by washing as by use. This is caused by the fierce
rubbing they get upon washing boards, or by the hands.
With the Beale Patent Washing Machines this friction is
done away with. Therefore, the clothes will last far longer
than by hand-washing, however careful. When the wash-
ing is done, the tub should be wiped out, so that it be
always sweet and clean. There is no false bottom, and
nothing to accumulate greasy sediments.
When you buy a Machine of any kind,
have a good one.

AMERICAN DISPENSARY

Dr. Speer is a regular Graduated Physician, educated at
Harvard College, U.S. (for confirmation see New Zealand
Gazette, January 21st, 1886; also New South Wales
Gazette, April 17th, 1888). The doctor has devoted 14
years to the study of CHRONIC, NERVOUS, AND
SPECIAL DISEASES. Four of these were in the leading
hospitals of the United States, which enables him to treat
all complaints with excellent results. All applying to
him will receive his honest opinion of their complaints.
No experimenting ;no Mercury used. He will guarantee
a positive cure in every case he undertakes, or forfeit
£2OO. His reason for doing so is this—when there is no
organic disease, and nothing but an inorganic trouble, or,
in other words, a conglomeration of si'mptoms producing
a certain result, there is no reason why it cannot be re-
moved with the proper remedies, therefore he guarantees.
He wishes it distinctly understood that he does not claim
to perform impossibilities, or to have miraculous power
he claims only to be a skilled and successful physician
thoroughly informed in his speciality—CHßONlC and
SPECIAL DISEASES of MEN and WOMEN. People
residing at a distance can, by explaining their troubles in
detail be treated at home. The course of treatment will
not in any way interfere with their business. Examina-
tion and advice free to all. Charges moderate. H. J.

In Asthma, Bronchitis, Rheumatism, Lumbago,

rpHERE exists a crying need for
the medical profession to stay
the quackery which is so rampant
in these colonies Men having no
medical qualifications nor aptitude
for the treatment of diseases, still
advertise with impunity as doctors;
and guarantee to do what they know'
they are incapable of doing, and
thus deceive the public who are
caught by their specious and lying
advcitis -ments, as is amply testified
by reading the exposures in the
Daily Telegraph from August 3
to 11,1887.
A chief cause of this state of things
is that medical hie'ii from mistaken
notions of professional decorum,
and because they consider it ivfra
dig, refrain from entering the field
against these quicks. .so long as this prudery exists so long will this canker consume our youth. At the risk, how-
ever of professional opprobrium I have decided to throw aside this false delicacy, and avow my sympathy with, and
readiness to treat such affections, in the hope of saving the young of both sexes from the ruin of health and mind
which consulting these quacks ensures, not to mention the ruin of their pockets.
A patient writes to me : “ I am in such a miserable state I would pay you what I could afford for a lifetime, if
you could possibly be the means of letting m? know what health is, and perhaps saving me from suicide which seems
to be my only release if this appeal fails. Kindly and humanely do not allow it to be in vain, and you will never regret
it. I have been victimised by a person calling himself a .‘.doctor.’ My father (of course I did not let him know the
nature of my ailmeht) paid this person £7 75., all for nothing, for which he said he would guarantee a cure in three
months.” Now, if qualified medical men would advertise in such a way as to bring their names befd're these sufferers,
and convince them of their sympathy, cases like the above which unfortunately are of daily occurrence, would not
occur : groundless fears would not be excited, and where disease exists it would be safely and permanently cured. I
am a and highly qualified practitioner, and have for over 20 years devoted especial study to chronic, nervous
and special diseases of men and women, and 1 am therefore justified in guaranteeing a cure in all casesWienable to
treatment.
• ' Sufferers from impaired vitality, or nervousness, should read my book on “Nervous Debility,” free by post foi-
ls where they will find much useful information and directions for self-cure. Those wishing a farther insight should
read mv work on the “ Male Generative Function in Health and Disease,” free by post for 2s. fid.

The End of a Liaison.
The Single-tax owes the factitious import-
ance which lias been attached to it as a pos-
sible factor in the practical politics of New
South Wales, in a primary and less degree
co the fanatical enthusiasm of four men—
Foxall, Farrell, Cotton, and Meggy—
(we purposely eliminate Garland, M.P.,
whose zeal to that of the others is as ginger-
pop unto Mackay rum) —not one of whom,
if we bar Farrell’s admirable verses, had
previously done aught to Justify him in
emerging from comparative obscurity. In a
secondary and much greater degree that im-
portance was due to the Sydney Daily
Telegraph, which, though seldom heard of
outside the province of New South Wales—
and only then when The Bulletin takes the
trouble to allude to it—has been enabled, by
the defects of its rivals, to win a large cir-
culation within New South Wales boun-
daries. Why the Telegraph did anything
at all for the “cause” of Confiscation will
appear later on. Suffice it to say here that
the journal not only began to do a lot for it,
but has gone on doing it almost to the pre-
sent hour. By mere dint of assiduity, the
quartette of enthusiasts just named gained a
footing in the correspondence columns of the
country and metropolitan press ; but, in point
of superficial or lineal measurement, the
King-Street Pen’orth has done move for
the Georgites than all the other journals of
the Australias put together. Thousands of
its columns has it, in the aggregate, given up
to the professional and amateur advocacy of
the Single-tax. No blather of the fanatics
and the cranks of the cult so windy but could
find a vent between its “rules;” no verbose
and long-drawn-out attempt at reasoning by
its more intelligent units but what could
be accommodated with a place in its broad-
side. Not a number—scarcely, indeed, a
page—of its diurnal issues for the last eighteen
months, but what “The Single-Tax,” in
bold captions to letters and reports, forced
itself with all its economic abourdity upon
the eye and the brain of the journal’s
readers, till by sheer wcarisomeness of
iteration the words blurred the one and
dazed the other. Measured by the debased
standard of the advertising-scale, the pecu-
niary publicity thus given to the principles
of the Georgeites—which, it may be here
remarked, are sometimes very different from
the principles of George— was worth thou-
sands of pounds to the “cause.” The
“cause,” in fact, had it needed to pay for one-
hundredth part of the amount of advertising
the Telegraph gratuitously gave it, would
have gone financially, and mentally and
morally “broke.” And yet this free, gratis
and for nuffin’ publicity was the least of the
things which our contemporary did for the
Confiscators.
A daily journal may devote a huge amount
of its space to correspondence reflecting
opinions of a more or less pronounced char-
acter, and yet be unsympathetic : nay,
indeed, be antagonistic to the source
whence they emanate. As a matter of fact,
and an easily verifiable detail of news-
paper policy, no sanely-conducted paper ever
does this thing, for such a paper, though
it may give moderate publicity to discor-
dant views, does not exist for the purpose of
pushing forward any sort of convictions but its
own. It is true we are not writing of sanely-
conducted papers but of the Telegraph,
and what can be predicated for the former
has not necessarily any bearing on the latter.
This being so, it was open to the Telegraph
to hand over its columns to the Single-taxers,
and yet to claim that it was still uninfected
by the Single-tax taint. But when it did
the only thing remaining to be done for the
“cause;” when it hired pens to expatiate
on the moral beauties, the economic advan-
tages, and the practical blessings of the
Single-tax, it could not, surely, longer claim
exemption from the infection ? a journal
that pays for and publishes articles of a
lefinitely partisan and sectional nature, and
purposely designed to advocate and earn
acceptance for a partisan and sectional creed,
cannot escape the natural inferences of its
act by publishing the contributions in the
portion of the paper given up to miscel-
laneous matter. Even the Telegraph is
supposed to know some portion of its busi-
ness, and it must have recognised that to a
journal which fills its columns in this way,
and piles for the amusement of its readers a
Pelion of paid-for slush on an Ossa of more or
less honorary slobber, is fairly attachable the
suspicion that in so doing it is playing its
own game, and not that of a possible enemy
or a disguised opponent. When, therefore,
the Telegraph, as all the world presumes,
handed its cheques to John Farrell and to
P. R. Meggy, and to “Unit,” and to other
journalistic screechers of the Georgian song,
to discuss in its columns —and not merely
to discuss but to advocate —the “Moral
Philosophy of the Single-tax,” it was
doing something which it and its readers
knew it could not do unless it believed in
the Georgian theory. Or —there is a des-
picable alternative —unless the prompting
motive for this curious course was a desire
which the paper dare not avow —a desire
which was therefore dishonest ; such as (we
will presume) a desire to use the Single-
taxers as the lady of easily-assaulted virtue
uses the decoy-duck to draw the victim of
the prospective black-mailing to her lair.
From one motive or the other must the
Telegraph have acted when it published and
paid for these communiques of the cult.
Which—the sequel will show.
* * *
From the standpoint of Telegraphic
ethics, the paper has remained non-com-
mitted to the support of the Georgian doc-
trine. Its square miles of voluntary and its
acres of paid-for contributions might, and
did, delude the Single-tax mind into the
belief that the paper was in sympathy with
it. The cranks openly claimed it as their
“ organ,” and even the two or three cautious
members of the clique avowed that “ when
Henry' George comes, the Telegraph will
come, too.” And not the Confiscators alone
held this view : every straightforward reader
of the paper must have shared it. But had
the Telegraph been challenged upon the
point, it would have replied : —“ We have
not spoken. Editorially, we have been
silent. We have published thousands of
letters, it is true ; we have published scores
of contributed pro tax articles —this is also
true ; butreehave not spoken out in the leading
columns.” Technically, this would have been
correct. The one thing which remained for it
to do for the Single-taxers it had not done.
All else it had done, or would do, but not
this. At least it did not do it—quite. But
neither did it do the contrary. If it did not
send out the Single-tax creed, with the im-
primatur of a “great” journal to the Free-
trade Faithful, as a dogma of the Nation
is commended to the children of Mother
Church ; neither did it use its anathema.
No, it did not advocate the tax in its “ lead-
ing columns ” —quite. What it did do, how-
ever, was to print occasionally leading
articles, in which the term “Single-tax”
jostled “ unearned increment ” repeatedly,
and into which could be read with the
greatest of ease a declaration of belief in the
Georgian theory. Verbally and directly
committed to the Single-tax, the Telegraph
was not ; implicitly and indirectly, it cer-
tainly was. Right up to the coming of
Henry George this was the position of the
paper towards the Georgites. The coquette
would not confess that she had succumbed
to the seducer ; she had only gone so far as
to compromise her name.
# * *
With the coming of George, the Single-
taxers looked for the public “arrival of
the Telegraph. The ’Frisco Evangelist
came, but the “arrival” of the paper did
not synchronise with the “ official landing
at Man-o’-war steps of the Apostle of Con-
fiscation. Nevertheless, it was felt that the
event could not be long delayed. Did not
the journal lend the brassiness of its best
trumpets to bulge out the volume of the
welcoming salute? It did! “ The Econo-
mist of the day,” a “ humanitarian of the
noblest sympathies and purest virtues,” “a
writer of force as logical as passionate ”
were not these ‘ ‘ elegant derangements of
epithets ” editorially slung at George and
George’s awe-strucK and Ko-tooing wor-
shippers 1 They were ! Did not the
Oracle speak, and did not the morrows of
the orations witness the publication of in-
terminable reports, and hysterical editorial
criticism, and more wordy frothings of the
cranks 1 They did ! Still the revelation of
the paper’s full and complete conversion was
withheld. Of superlative eulogies on
George's work as an auxiliary sort of screw-
jack that is lifting up the semi-moribundity of
Freetrade from the low level where it was
being asphyxiated to a higher grade where
there was a chance for air and life, the
paper was more than liberal. It was pro-
digal. Of the word that could carry sub-
stantial comforo to the souls of the con-
fiscators, not a solitary syllable till .
But here we must ask our readers to give us
pause ! The recollection of our vision of
the exultant elation which seized the Single-
taxers on the morning of the 31st March,
when they observed the D.T. editorial
headline : “ The Taxation of Land ” is too
much for us ; we require time to recover.
* * #
Eureka ! Thalassa ! Vide ! Whoop !
Hurroo ! The joy of Archimedes, the rap-
tures of the Greeks, the triumph of a
Chcsar, the pure pleasure of the Chocktaw
scalp-hunter, the innocent gaiety of the
Donnybrook boy, sound feeble compared
with the intensity of expression of the
declaration, as largely anticipated as the
realisation of any Messianic hope—the
moment for which they had hungered, and
thirsted, and wor-ked, and spent their beer-
money and their pocket-money—had come.

As to all that has been said against the the theory of

faces them in the Telegraph leader. That
could only mean one thing—only that the
Telegraph had at last came body and soul
over to the “ Cause.” “ Those who are not
with us are against us,” had said George,
and now the Telegraph had ranged them-
selves against George’s opponents and
therefore on George’s side. The anxieties
and the doubts and the fears of 18 months
vanished with the rejoicing-shout with which
Single-taxers welcomed the utterance above
quoted. And then they proceeded to read
the rest of the article —only to discover when
they had forced their fad-fogged intellects to
appreciate the significance of other para-
graphs, and to evolve from tortuous phrase
and involved argument the carefully wrapped-
up meaning that they had been most un-
mitigatingly “had !” '1 he Telegraph had ex-
pressed itself at last on the Single-tax, but
it had done so as an enemy—nay, as worse
than enemy : as a treacherous friend—who
has sold the citadel to the foe !
# * *
The primary proposition of the Georgian
theory, which includes the basic principle,
is given in the italicised line of “Progress
and Poverty,” chap. 11., book YIII.—“ To
abolish all taxation save that upon land-
values." But the Telegraph’s declaration
approves of a land-cum-property-tax ! Pre-
mising that a land tax —mark, .not a tax on
land values, but a land-tax—
Is to be regarded as a most equitable and desirable
form of taxation, and especially so under the conditions
of New South Wales,
it concludes its summary of reasons in favour
of such a tax by the pregnant —and in view
of the Ministerial inspiration of which this
journal is avowedly the receiver—profoundly
significant assertion ;
Land should be taxed as part of the general taxation
which all property should be made to bear. !!!!!!
This, then, is the culmination of the Tele-
graph’s coquetry with the Single-tax ! It has
not succumbed to the Georgian tempter—not
that it has remained chaste ; it has done
infinitely worse —it has sold its virtue to the
land-monopolist. A land-tax, as defined and
understood by the mass of economists, is
denounced by George and the Georgites,
and for these reasons : It conflicts with their
bed-rock principle—the exemption of the
products of labour from taxation. Its
minimum force falls on city property, and
its maximum on country lands, while, accord-
ing to their contention, the reverse should
be the case. And its incidence is less upon
the economic rent of land than upon the profit
rent which accrues from improvements.
"What George contends for is not a land-tax
but a tax on the unimproved value of land.
To assume an identity of character between
the two modes is to argue the identity of the
moon and green cheese ; and to use ‘ ‘ Land-
tax ” and “ Single-tax” as convertible terms
—and the Telegraph does both these things
all through the article of the 31st March—
and for the paper to imply that it is friendly
to George while advocating “general taxa-
tion on all property ” —the abolition of which
method of revenue-raising is George’s aim—
is either to display a most lamentable, and,
in this connection, most culpable ignorance,
or to willingly parade a moral perversion as
an accepted truth. We give our contem-
porary a choice of the positions—it can
take which it pleases. For ourselves,
we reserve the right to point out that
there is evidence in the Telegraph
article of more than a mere error of
knowledge or a radical defect in the logical
faculty. We conceive it reveals something
very like a moral confusion, not to say a
studied duplicity. George had come and
had gone. He had done all the good he
could directly do for the Freetrade party ;
and therefore there was no reason why con-
siderations of the worth of his advocacy as a
“ fiscal authority ” should any longer prevent
an expression of the journal’s real views on
the land question. But the Georgeites re-
mained ; they could not be shunted alto-
gether, nor openly flouted or insulted,
because they form the Pure Merinos of the
Freetrade flock. Let, therefore, the editorial
“ We” reconcile the irreconcilable : claim to
be George’s friend, gush as to “the un-
earned increment’’- and all the while go for
a land-tax as part of a . scheme of general
property taxation. This the Telegraph did,
and though the achievement is scarcely what
ought to have been expected from a journal
which necessarily preaches its. high-toned
devotion to the ethics of an enlightened
journalism, and cants hebdomadally about
the purity of its democratic faith, it is still
characteristically Telegraphic.
# # *
The Single-taxers now realise that they
have been tricked and deceived. We are not
sorry for them. Had their aggregated
crania contained one gi’ain of common-sense
they would not have expected any other
result. What—the Telegraph go straight
for Confiscation ? What would become of
Chairman Carey’s mortgages ? of Director
Robert Sands’ land-boom money ? of
largest Shareholder Gorman’s enormous real-
property-sales commissions'? of Shareholder
Walter Hall’s Mount Morgan dividends?
Did the cranks ever dream that a journal of
which Bruce Smith, of the British Liberty
and Property Defence League, is a reputed,
and Land-Auctioneer Mills, a certain stock-
holder, would ever yell boldly for Plunder
by Act of Parliament, and shriek for legis-
lative sanction to grasp it and smash at one
swoop both the major source of its adver-
tising income—land-sale “ads.”—and the
chief element of its subscription revenue —
the pennies of Bill Jones and Tom Smith,
who have sunk a life-time’s hard-earned
savings in a suburban allotment ? If they
did they are crankier than even we con-
sidered them. The Single taxers merit
no sympathy. They may be clothed
with the ashes of humiliation and in
the sackcloth of despair, and the popular
verdict is “Serve ’em right.” They sought
to use the Telegraph, and it has used them.
They had striven by its agency to force the
hand of the “great Freetrade party,” and
to make it play the legitimate drama of
absolute Freetrade instead of the composite
farce of revenue-taiiftism —they have their
reward. Their Apostle and Master was em-
ployed as a call-boy to his particular abomi-
nations —the tariftists, and permitted, as an
especial privilege, to ring-up the curtain on
a repeated performance of that curious com-
pilation of broad humour and idiotic ano-
malies : “Freetrade as it is known in New
South Wales,” while they themselves were
enlisted in the ranks of the claque. The
Telegraph has “ had” them, but they need
not wail about their injured innocence.
They were “on the same lay” themselves,
but, as it has happened, the newspaper got
there first.
Unearned Increments.
Dear Bulletin, —Unearned increments attach to
all forms of human labour. Wherever there is
an earned increment there must be an unearned
one. Whatever power or faculty a civilised man
cmpk>3’s there come to him as rewards direct and
immediate benefits, and also indirect benefits
derived from his association with others in a
village, a city, or a country—in any field of labour.
Let a man start business in the early days of a
community. He manufactures aerated waters or
spirituous liquors, or makes boots or clothes, or
prints a newspaper. Whether he work with a
machine or with his hands an increase in the
number of his customers will be met with a less
proportional increase in the labour and the
materials used. One pattern will do for several
orders, and the larger the number of articles the
cheaper will be the material for each. There are
in these cases an earned and what is called an
unearned increment —the former the work of the
worker alone, the latter that of the worker and the
community.
# # #
A newspaper is established early in the life of a
city. Its outlook is to a portion of a 20,000 popu-
lation. The city possesses such natural advantages
as attract strangers, or its Government induces
settlement by systems of assisted or free immigra-
tion, and the city thus comes to have 200,000
residents. That newspaper has expanded to
answer the new demands, and a profit which
might have been £IOOO a year when the population
was 20,000 may become £20,000 or £30,000 when
the population is 200,000. Extra machinery,
extra manual, extra mental work must, of
course, be provided, but over and above the
value of these there is a residue of profit
which has been derived from the action of
Government or of the community generally. A
writer publishes a book when his world is young.
Only a portion of his community read, and his
anticipated profits are confined to the patronage
of these. But Government applies a principle of
compulsory education, and thereby indefinitely
extend the sphere of his profits and puts into his
pockets thousands instead of hundreds of pounds.
Association with others and the action of the
State, or Society and Government, have given to
the work of this man’s hands, or of his brain, a
reward over and above the reward for which he at
the time toiled, and which at the time he possibly
regarded as sufficient. Whatever piece of work a
man does, if that work be profitable to Society at
large, there comes from it a profit earned directly
by the individual, and which may be and
should be paid over at once, and a profit earned
indirectly by the individual and directly by the
community, which acts as his partner or fellow-
labourer. The individual and the community
have each a moral claim on this latter profit.
# * *
When Henry George says that land cliffei’s from
all other sources or objects of labour he states a
physical fact. But physical facts have no special
value in an economic discussion. Whatever man,
as a member of society, busies his hands upon, oi
his mind upon, as n*means to provide himself and
his family with food, is for the time being his tool
of trade. It may be a portion of land, it may be
a portion of water, it may be birds in the air, it
may be fish in the sea; it may be a singer s
voice, it may be an artist’s pencil, it may be a


writer’s pen. The work may gnarl the hands, or
sweat the brow, or weary the brain, or sadden
the heart ; but in the proper social economic
•sense it is work, only work, human work. The
poet who drives his imagination, the ploughman
who drives his plough, the drayman who drives
his dray, all face the same way. They answer to
the one name—Worker. That land differs in its
physical qualities from phantasies of the brain,
from emotions of the heart, does not properly
come into consideration when the worker’s title
to the direct and indirect reward of his toil is at
stake. The man who goes to the land is either
driven by necessity or induced by liking; the
man who goes to brain-work is similarly
acted on. That the man who goes to
the land goes to an object which he has
nut created is utterly foreign to the ques-
tion at issue. Whether he created it or did not
create it, he can only now (in a formed state of
society) become possessor of it on the same terms
as he can come to own a horse, a cart, a suit of
clothes, a pair of boots —he must give the economi-
cal equivalent for it. If he do not work the land
nothing comes to him but the indirect, or, as it is
called, unearned increment; if he do work it, just
as if he bought a horse and worked him, there will
come, or should come, present payment for his
labour and a share in the value which his partner,
Society, confers upon his investment.
* # *
The lever that shall lift the rvorld to better
ground will be controlled by the principle not that
land is a unique property, but that it is portion of
the great common property. It differs physically
from a machine, but not economically. In a
formed society the man who gives a thousand
pounds for an acre of land and he who gives a
thousand pounds for a machine are equally
entitled to the profits, present and prospective, of
their purchases. It is true that the machine will
wear out and the land will remain, but that is a
subject determining or influencing the initial
value of the purchase and not the issue of it.
Herbert Spencer’s mental difficulty as to one
man coming to own the habitable globe and
throwing everyone else over the side is the state-
ment of an extreme which does not count in
human affairs. It might as well be thrown in as
an argument that if private ownership of money
were allowed one man might come to own all
the money in the world and turn every house-
holder out for arrears of rent. Might not simi-
larly, if machinery be allowed, one man be con-
ceived to obtain possession of all machinery and
thus perform all the work of a country ? For one
man to perform all work would be socially as
disastrous as for one man to own all the land.
Instead, then, of beginning with the principle
that land is a special property, the principle that
it is a portion of common property, to be bought
and sold like other property, will lead to clearer
views.
* * #
For then we can limit the individual, in what-
ever direction a spirit of undue aggrandisement
drives him. By a sliding scale of taxation the
State can take from the subject a fair share of the
profits which her partnership with him produces,
leaving him also a share and the whole of his
directly-earned profits. This principle will work
over the whole sphere of human labour, whatever
the form of industry may be and whatever the
material it is expended upon. The way to results
on these lines is already paved with legislative
enactments. Land laws aie in existence which
tax estates and which admit compulsory expro-
priation when the needs of the State so require.
Taxes on income are in existence which make the
large receiver a large disburser, and which, when
the State requires it, may be used to compulsorily
expropriate income over a certain amount. With
this legislative machinery, known to our
generation and understood if not universally
favoured by it, the introduction of a
new classification of materials, based on the
fallacy of a physical difference, is a diver-
sion from the onward path. To oil that machinery,
to set it more swiftly going, to make it reach the
rich man, from whatever source he derives his
riche i, and to keep near him so that when the
volume of his income threatens to be a menace to
the St.ate all over a given amount shall be taxed
away, is the need of the present.
* * #
Sociology does not pivot on land or on any one
property in the universe. All property, earth and
sea and sky, light and darkness, wind and rain,
and bird and beast and fish, are its axis, but the
power which puts it in motion is the mental, the
spiritual, the bodily competition between man and
man, woman and woman, child and child. The
centripetal and centrifugal forces that drive the
race along are loves and hates, hopes and des-
pairs, hungers and satisfactions, the tyranny of
the few, the cowardice of the many, the actual
greed of some, the yearning for fullness of all.
The past distribution of land is but an agent of
evil; amended, it will be but one engine of good.
Society is a box of discords. George attempts to
screw up a wire and promises melody, harmony ;
but even if he succeed in screwing the wire up
properly, it will produce but one pure tone where
almost every note, from treble to bass, jars. And
he cannot screw it up properly. Land is no longer
a virgin. It has been wedded to system after
system, been enslaved, been freed, been sold, been
bought. Its early lords are no longer its sole
©wners. The Hodges have now their allotments,
and under the plighted troth of the community
the direct and indirect increment of their posses-
sions must be theirs while the direct and indirect
increments of any class of property flow to the
possessors of it.

PLAIN ENGLISH.
A Defence of Royalty.
Mr. Frank Hill, attempting a mild defence of
Royalty in the Contemporary Review, says “the
great evil of the monarchy is the social flunkeyism
of which it is the centre, the abject snob-ism which
produces, the base servility which radiates from
>t m circles ever widening.” If Frank Hill were
to continue discussing his subject from now until
tlie Last Trump sounds he could find no satisfac-
tory reasons why a system productive of such evils
as he admits ought not to be calmly, quietly, and
immediately wiped from the face of the earth.
Lue would be worth living but for its precious
social “circles,” which degrade the character of
those who blindly accept them as the designs of
1 hpyiDKNOE, disgust enlightened Radicals, and
embitter the existence even of those wretched
snubs who scheme and fret to reach one circle
hearer to the Throne, There will always be ser-
V| hty and toadyism in the world until the
people who encourage servility and toadyism
II ?.. pemg due to their intellectual eminence,
oiheial position, or bank-account, are regenerated
o.V wholesome ridicule. But who can excuse the
If « a l. >e °l )l0 in giving life to the canker-worm
’ nmikey ism, which is Monarchy, in order that it
lua y ‘‘at its rotting way into the body politic?
Because Victoria Regina is the granddaughter
of a doddering old lunatic she is fed, housed, and
dressed in robes of State, specially prayed for by
that pious bulwark of flunkeyism, the Established
Church, and set up as a semi-sacred symbol of
Hingland’s Greatness. If she could be secluded
in a temple like a pagan goddess, then there were
little fault to find with the Queen as an institu-
tion. The passing of a great popular Parliamen-
tary Bill might be harmlessly celebrated by stick-
ing lighted tapers round the Queen and requesting
her to drink the Nation's health. Instead of this
the people allow her to be used as a standard of
false distinction, by which her “subjects” are
permitted to measure their social stature, Ho we
come to have men seeking nominal “honours”
from the Queen, when they would perhaps seek
the real respect of their fellows but for the Queen,
with her snobbery-creating powers, being there.
We have women, who might have sought distinc-
tion for their charity and kindness, content to be
remarkable for having attended a Queen’s Drawing-
Room. The Queen is the source of a myriad of
miserable social ambitions, which would die
with the destruction of Monarchy, and be
replaced by worthier aims. Pension off the
Queen, turn courts into factories of useful
things, and abolish the dangerous distinction
of titles (save only official titles which are
necessary in moderation—Governor or President
is sufficient official title without such muck as
“ Excellency ” being hitched on). Yes, get rid of
these demoralising influences upon manhood, and
then there will no longer be even an imaginary
glory in entertaining a pimply, knocked-out earl,
or a pudding-headed K.O.M.G. at one’s poor
“ but otherwise honest dinner-table.” Mr. Prank
Hill seems to forget that the abject snobbery
which monarchy produces, the social flunkeyism
and base servility of which, as he so innocently
says, it is the centre, are all that a constitu-
tionally-governed nation gets from the old
fetish. Monarchy has no compensating good
to set off against its great evil. That same
great evil is the one attribute of the system
which is traditionally regarded as a virtue. Has
it not became part of the official English religion
that the Queen possesses no fault except her in-
disposition to flounce around and be “good for
trade ? ” She would rank as an absolutely unim-
peachable Figure-Head of State if she caused more
money to be spent in flunkeyism and vainglory.
The fools make it a ground of complaint against
the Queen that she potters away her existence in
the completest privacy possible for her to enjoy,
and thus makes herself an eternal reminder to
them of their childish stupidity in thinking the
Queen is necessary to the State.
Dilke’s Withdrawal.
Australia is informed by cable, under date,
April 2, that:—
The offensive remarks with reference to Sir Henry
Parkes in the chapter relating to New South Wales in Sir
Charles Dilke’s “ Problems of Greater Britain ” are to
be eliminated from the new edition in deference to the
many protests received by the author and publishers.
In other words, Sir Charles Dilke is going to
saw off Parkes’ horns and glue on a halo. Here
are the “offensive ” remarks, as extracted from the
unbowdlerised edition of “Problems of Greater
Britain ” ;
Sir Henry Parkes, who has something of the aspect of
Mr. Punch’s Father Thames, but with a clean beard, is the
patriarch among colonial politicians. His career has been
described by his enemies as a closely knit tissue of suc-
cessful artifices, and it is characteristic of the man that a
number of copies of the publication in which that state-
ment was made having been purchased by a previous Ad-
ministration on coming into office he caused them to be
burnt at a bonfire at the Government Printing-office. .
[Dilke is now making a bonfire at the order of Parkes’
friends. —Ed. B.] He is not really popular, but only followed
or admired, which is a different thing ; and, while he has
few old friends, has many foes. He is capable of large
ideas, and is often the author of far-reaching pro-
posals, but is wanting in grasp of details. He is
in his element in a popular Assembly, reigning
and rejoicing in the storms of debate with marvellous
physical power. _ He has a tendency to be jealous of his
neighbours, and in a colony which, as a whole, is jealous
of Victoria, he is the person who is most jealous. Sir
Henry Parkes has retired from public life more often
than a popular actor from the stage, and the occasional
raffles of his effects have not lessened the number of his
political admirers. Sir Henry Parkes believes in himself
and that deep self-belief undoubtedly impresses many of
those about him, and makes them too believe. He is one
of those to whom age is useful. His years protect him
from the assaults of the young lions, and when he closes
his speeches by reference to the whiteness of beard and
hair, which has come upon him in the service of his
adopted country, the people are apt to go and vote for the
“ poor old man.” [We can hear him snivel now.— Ed. B ]
When Sir H. Parkes wrote in “ The Strong Man
Like a rock that breasts the sea,
Firm he stood, in front of foes;
To his friends a sheltering tree,
That in changeless beauty grows,
he may have been thinking of himself; but in person he
has been as little favoured by nature with good looks as
Socrates or Darwin. For all that, there is an assurance
of strength in the massy features, and a consciousness in
the eyes that their owner is not an ordinary man. The
fact is this, with all his faults and all his weakness, Sir
Henry Parkes is the only great political power in N.S.W.
His sympathy with the democratic ideas which are upper-
most in Australia, and his devotion to the colony and
broad grasp of affairs, give him a greater hold upon the
people than any other Australian public man. His debts,
his poetry, are powerless to sink him ; and as a man who
knows how to use, like so many chess-men, the sections
which take place ’mid parties in colonial politics, he is un-
doubtedly one of the ablest of politicians, in this respect
almost ranking with Sir John Macdonald.
Very likely the fact that other mixtures of truth
and offensiveness concerning the immortal Parkes
have not been “withdrawn in deference to pro-
tests received ” is because their circulation has
heretofore been practically restricted to Australia,
whereas by being measured up in Dilke’s book in
full view of the English public, Sir Henry Parkes
is wounded in his most vulnerable point—his love
of Hinglish distinction. Among the most enthu-
siastic and valued admirers of Sir Henry Parkes
and all his works is Mr. .John Haynes, M.P.,
who is so great and politically important a man
that he last week actually got a vote of confidence
fiom the cultured inhabitants of “Bungwall Flat
and Coolongoolook.” And yet this big potentate
actually wrote of Sir Henry aforesaid within the
last four years (when bis present god was out of
office); —
The policy of the Parkes Opposition is cheek, and its
consistency is that of sand. It is excessively a cheeky
thing to suppose that this country is about to be com-
mitted once more to the hands of Sir Henry Parkes.
This man s day is past. It would be dangerous to give
him the reins of Government again. The simple reason is,
that distinguished man is suffering from a galloping con-
sumption of the brain. Any man capable of the freaks
which have marked Sir Henry Parkes’ speeches and
actions, particularly during the past two years is cer-
tainly not a safe man. To intrust him with serious
political work would be to allot him duties beyond hia
mental powers. And that is what must be said of Sir
Henry Parkes. It is a painful fact, but a fact neverthe-
less. And as the dusk of evening is setting on the career
of Sir Henry, it is fitting to remark what an out-and-out
one it has been. Sir Henry Parkes was born with
half the ability of a statesman, and got the educa
tion of an alderman. His life was a mixture of both.
Over and over again he has told us that he was
the arcliitect of his own fortune. And over and over
again we have thought he ought to have prosecuted the
aforesaid architect. That architect began at the roof of
the edifice, and built downwards; and it has been eternal
patching ever since. Sir Henry Parkes says he began
life with a sixpence. We’re afraid he’ll leave off without
one. This can be said of Sir Henry Parkes he legislates
for Parkes. We don’t believe the cause of humanity ever
found a true response in his breast. On his cedar chair in
the old Government offices by the tig-tree he was a
Napoleonic snob. He affected the first consul, and was
only his butler. Ho was a perfect O.ESAR— in wax. An
emperor without a subject even to punish. He would
have reporters and officials crawl to his feet, and his great
feat seemed to be to distend his nostrils as he deigned to
speak to the officers of the people. This is a true picture
of the man in a few words. It is a reflex from a mirror.
Nature intended to make the original great; but. she
struck work when half through the job.
This is nasty, but in the main it is as true as
Gospel. Sir Charles Duke, in revising his
book, had better re-touch his estimate of the Aus-
tralian Gladstone in the light thrown upon the.
latter’s character by one of his greatest friends.
Mr. John Haynes, M.P., knows ever so much
more about Sir Henry Parkes than does Sir
Charles Dilke.

If the senior Bar continue to follow the example
set by Salomons, Q.C,, in his anti-Georgian
oration, times will be very bad with the clergy.
In other words, if the lawyers, not content with
acting on behalf of the Devil, begin to claim, like
Parkes and Henry George, an intimate and even
exclusive acquaintance with the will of Heaven,
white-chokers, surplices, and Geneva gowns,
hitherto accepted as the insignia of the only
genuine and authorised depositaries of the
Almighty’s confidence, will have to give way to
silk and horsehair in the work of justifying the
ways of God to man. However, we have little
doubt that so long as the Devil flourishes the
senior Bar will find it more profitable to hold
briefs for his children than to scoop the collec-
tion-plate. But if the junior and briefless Bar—
we grow pale at the thought of what would hap-
pen to the clergy then! It seems probable that
for some time to come the clergy and the apostles
of the Single-tax League will equally share the
privilege of speaking as the holders of power of
attorney from the Omnipotent. Will everybody
please leave God out of their political speeches ?
The blasphemous belief is growing day by day
that the power which rules the universe does not
depute either parsons, lawyers, or politicians to be
its mouthpieces any more than it deputes cats-
meat-men.

You must judge by internal evidence whether or
not this is the correct reply given by Chief Secre-
tary Deakin to the deputation on the Bella
Ferguson case
Chief Secretary’s Department,
Monday.
Gentlemen,
After due consideration, the Cabinet have decided that
the prerogative of mercy cannot be exercised in regard to
the prisoner Bella Ferguson, under 10 years’ sentence
for infanticide.
The Cabinet fully recognises the principle that the
father of the child ought to bear at least an equal share of
the punishment with the mother ; in fact more.
But the peculiarity in this case, is that it is not proved
there was any intervention of a man in the production of
the child. Had there been any man in the case he would
have received at least seven years of the sentence and the
woman three years. This, however, was a case of spon-
taneous production.
Our laws being made equally by women and men, of
course fair justice is done to both sexes. In every case,
where there is a man concerned, he deserves the penalty
equally with the woman.
I have the honour to be, gentlemen,
Yours obediently,
Alfred Deakin.
When Judge Williams sentenced five young
Melbourne men to nine years’ penal servitude
apiece for swearing that one Cutler wasn’t in
Little Bourke-street, Melbourne, on the night
when a certain Chinaman was kicked to death, a
great hoarse shout of satisfaction went up from
the local press. The newspapers congratulated
society upon the fact that Judge Williams had
“spoken out’ on this occasion, and orthodox re-
spectability regarded him as another Daniel come
to judgment—until four other young men,
charged with saying what the first five had
said, were tried and acquitted. Then the
possibility of Mr. Williams having opened his
mouth too widely began to dawn upon the dull
understanding of even the daily newspapers, and
the faith of orthodox respectability in “warning
examples ” took a change for the better. As time
went on those splendid Cutler Perjury Case sen-
tences acquired the reputation of being down-
right scandalous, because they didn’t seem to
fit in anyhow with the acquittal of the
four men now at large. Something must
be done, everybody could see. So the law, the
daily newspapers, and the people who stand by
those institutions in all time of their tribulation,
seem to have agreed together that the first lot of
prisoners were guilty, although the others were
not guilty, but that some of the guilt had got
rubbed off ; therefore the sentences of nine years
should be reduced to three years’ penal servitude.
In short, Judge Williams, the hero of 12 months
ago, now stands convicted of having ordered 30
years more of gaol than was right and fair to be
shared by five of his fellow-countrymen. This
illogical and scandalous compromise of the Cutler
ease will apparently be allowed to stand. It is a
disgraceful ending to a rascally scandal, in which
the stupid old law, the hot-headed judge, and the
criminal police—especially the police—have all
taken a hand. There is no doubt that the last four
men tried for perjury were acquitted because
Judge Williams had passed such a ridiculously
severe sentence on the first five, who, for then-
part, were only guilty of going beyond the truth
m order to save an innocent man whom the police
were moving heaven and earth to hang.
In one of those serio-comic articles for which it is
so notorious, that shifty and orawlsome bourgeois
print, fehe London Daily Telegraph, “hits off”
the late baby-show held in Sydney, with its cul-
minating battle-royal ’twixt impetuous mothers
and impartial judges. The D.T. opens with this
leader’’laconism : “In Australia, where every
British institution is copied with amusing
fidelity,” &c. Now there is a patriarchal patron-
age and tender tel era nee about that statement
which eharactciises the Daily Telegraph and
other “great organs ” when dealing with subjects
and doings “colonial,” It is a marvel, though,
that, while on the subject of babies, the arch-
humorist who “worked up” this article omitted
to state that the Australian babies themselves (let
alone their shows) were produced with an “amus-
ing fidelity ” to the pattern of the British baby.
It were simple also to point out how the British
institution of reproduction of species had been
“copied” with enthusiasm (and “amusing
fidelity ”) by the colonials, proving that wo were
not a proud or prejudiced people, but are willing
to adhere to, nor striving to improve upon those
“ institutions ” which have stood the test of time.
The Bulletin wrote about the jealousy of the
military authorities towards the volunteer# in
England, the dread by Premier Salisbury and
others lest the volunteers, a truly national force,
should become too powerful, wherefore they must
have inferior arms to the regulars. Here is an
evidence that the same kind of feeling exists in
Australia. The Victorian Government has been
worrying at the Admiral commanding for leave to
send Victorian Naval officers on board the Eng-
lish men-o’-war in Australian waters, so that they
may have a little sea practice. But no, that does
not chime in with the Policy. After resisting as
long as possible, grudging leave has been given for
two lieutenants to go on a cruise, but it is ex-
pressly provided that they are never to be en-
trusted with any important functions. What an
instinct underlies this, what an affection of the
Lion for the Kangaroo ! The Victorian Minister
of Defence announces that he feels quite humi-
liated _by the conditions imposed, and it seems
there is to be some sort of an appeal to the Queen.

This is how the Melbourne detectives go to work.
Detective Christie, of the Customs Department,
went in disguise to a meeting of book-fiends. He
was got up suitably in a Mephistophelean mous-
tache, black wig over his white hair, and spec-
tacles. _ Next day he rushed to the newspapers,
with his splendid achievement. One must con-
clude he did, because it appeared in the press.
Either it came from him, or from a book-fiend, in
which case the disguise can have been of no use.
But Christie’s glory did not attain the climax
till a newspaper published an engraving of him,
with and without the disguise, and a laudatory
notice. It praises Christie as the most active and
honest of detectives, and, of course, nobody would
dare to write the contrary, even if they fancied he
was not absolutely at the top of the tree in either of
those requirements. The absurd publicity in-
dulged in by Melbourne detectives should be the
subject of official action. They swank about in
public places and at public bars. Everyone knows
them. People say “There’s Detective So-AND-
So !” Their portraits are published in the news-
papers, accompanied by lists of exploits supplied
by themselves. Is this the spirit in which the
clever detectives of London, Paris, and New York
work? In most countries the detective derives
all his power from being unknown. The Mel-
bourne men might as well go about in full uniform.
A thousand cases of whisky were lately shipped
from London to Bombay, and what think you was
the invoice price? Ninepence a bottle—nine
shillings a dozen. At what distance does this
stuff kill in tropic India? Oh, the blessings of
“our” civilisation! “We” thrust opium on
China at the point of the bayonet (and Bible);
and if India didn’t take our whisky, we would
want to know the reason why—in a Christian
spirit. One may calculate there is just a thousand
comfortable deaths in those thousand cases, but
then we can pray over them! All good cases,
brethren !

Sir M. H. Davies, the Victorian Speaker, is
mildly hauled over the coals by the Banking and
Insurance Record for what is indeed a con-
summate piece of cool impudence. He bosses
three or four financial companies. Two he called
after the names of his own two little sons,
“ Arnold and Co.” and Gascoyne and Co.” The
stupid nonsense of this palled on the shareholders
and the names were changed. Well, at one of hi*
companies, the smug Davies (in the chair) warned
the shareholders against “plunging.” The Re-
cord says such warnings come with amusing
effect if they are made by men who have realised
vast fortunes by promoting land-booms which
have enriched the promoters at the cost of a host
of poor victims. Davies is the prince of boomers.
We don't know why there should always be an in-
gredient of piety in these things, but so it is. One
eye to the Soul, another to the Savings. The latter
is a real good eye. For the other a glass one
will do.
Henniker Heaton has managed to soueeze
in amid the “Celebrities at Home”in the World,
with some eye-openers, as, for instance, that his
opulence is the fruit of three fortunes—one he
made, one he inherited, and one he married. We
had thought this trinity of fortunes resolved itself
practically into one, on the principle of the
Athenasian creed—“ And yet there are not three
booms, but one boom.”
“I cannot attempt to coerce a Nation,’
said Burke, apropos to the struggle for American
independence. The Czar is going to imprison all,
positively all, the Russian University students.
What set them going was those splendid articles
by George Kennan, the American, on Siberian
cruelties. However did they get into Russia?
The Czar goes stamping round. His police are

Australasia’s fattest man, Tom Jennings,

he has a soul light as a feather. Soulfully he
doesn’t weigh as much as a seidlitz-powder. Tom
Jennings, who must have been about 65 when he
died, was a Yorkshireman—a fine, good-hearted
old fellow to look upon, whose honest, cheery,
healthy face took you back to bracing English air.

A sight for gods and men to see ;
Twice sixteen stone of flesh and bone
The worthy Thomas cal'ed his own,
And when he took his daily round
He seemed to shake the very ground.
But Tom his bulk did ne’er disgrace,
His heart was in its proper place ;
And when it ceased to beat at last,
The whisper “ Dead !” through Hobart paus’d.
And friends he’d left this world to roam
Knew Tom still lived in H:v. ve t Home.


[?]
846 Macquarie-street North, Sydney, April 0, 1890.
My Dear Moorabinda,—
At a recent titled London wedding a novel idea was hit
on for the wedding party—no ladies being invited on the
bridegroom’s side. This rather startling novelty will save
a lot of heart-burning if it becomes the thing, since it is
one of the most blood-curdling sights at a wedding to see
the veiled antagonism of rival mammas. They are usually
both equally gorgeously attired mi velvets and nodding
plumes, and both are equally anxious to he “ principal
maternal head,” as it were, and it’s the fun of the world
to see them manoeuvring. But sometimes the bride-
groom’s female relatives—who generally manage to feel
and look aggrieved at the turn things are taking-don’t
trouble even to veil their nastiness. I was at a semi-
private wedding once when the bridegroom’s mother in-
sisted on t aking her son’s arm out of church, asserting
that she had a prior right to clutch his humerus, and
leaving the poor little bride to follow trembling with her
mother 1 And, apropos to weddings, it's the correct
thing to he dismal on these occasions as who should say
“ Poor martyr ! what a dreadful example !” even though
the martyr is about to exchange rags for ribbons and fried
chops for French cookery.
But, after all, female jealousy is the root, of all evil.
The big steamship companies know this. Why do they
not allow each captain to voyage with his wife? Is it
because they think Airs. Captain would make him so
comfortable as to divert him from his duties? No,
indeed ; the danger lies all in the direction of the female
passengers to whom ho is not. married. The reason the
captain’s wife is not allowed on board is that she would
insist on being the captainess, the social head of the ship,
and would not allow her alleged lord to make himself
commonly civil to the fair creatures who had paid their
passages. She would be the cause of snarling and discon-
tent among the thousand and one women who consider
that the gallant skipper should likewise march them up
and down the deck by the arm, instead of devoting his
whole attention to that proud cat of a wife. Conse-
quently, every living woman would arrive at her journey’s
end with a grievance against the company.
A big Sydney jewellery-firm ar - e keeping an anxious eye
on the matrimonial impulses of brother Rupert, whose
nuptials with Miss Horsfal are still en espagne. When the
happy day was fixed last year the firm expanded into a
set of silver-mounted beer-jugs, to be presented to the
bride and bridegroom, but unfortunately the ceremony
didn’t take place, and the beer-jugs remain—mute wit-
nesses in a general way to the foil} of being sure to-day
about what will happen to-morrow.
Those engaged maidens of some years' standing who'
view the approach of their Gussies natal day with hope-
less despair, knowing that they have set him up in slip-
pers, cap, cigar-case, and all the gaudy etceteras that go
to make life a dreary burden to tire engaged young man,
will, doubtless, jump for joy and canonise your Sappho
on the spot when they read that the very latest masculine
idea is to have a pair of suspenders to each divided gar-
ment. The reason is that when they are hung from the
wardrobe-hook their own weight keeps them from creas-
ing or bagging at the knees ; and, again plurality of sirs,
penders is advocated from a “ save-time” point of view,
since every pair of trousers differs in length, and with one
pair of braces a man must be hauling in and letting out
until he’s tired. In making this fad generally known 1
feel that, though acting the part of a friend to my own
sex, I am doing a gross injustice to the voting aggregate.
Previously a fiance had only to suffer under one pair I
of hlush-rose-hroidered braces that wouldn’t regulate,
but now every natal day will shadow forth another pair
with “ To Johnnie, with Tottie’s love,” in brilliant silk up
the back, until life will become a mocking horror to the
Romeo who goes a-swiniming in company.
A typical fine Easter Monday attendance thronged all
parts of Randwick race-course, on 7th inst., to see “good
old Carbine” waltz off with the Sydney Cup. In the
vice-regal enclosure—which was simply overflowing with
gilt-edged humanity—the Countess of Hopetoun was the
most gaped-at, since this was her first appearance before a
Sydney audience. She is a tall, sylphlike vision with
hollow cheeks and an infrequent smile, and she wore on
this occasion a neat tailor-built frock of fawn tweed in
small checks with vest and Directoire collars of ivory silk
—floral bonnet of small white flowers tied on with white
tulle strings. Lady Carington, who looks positively
round and rosy after her summer’s respite, wore that
Parisian gown of sky-blue chiffon, Directoire frills and
full sleeves over slate-blue silk designed in bronze, bonnet
in blue and white and blush roses-cream parasol and
gloves the colour of daffodils ; while Lady Scott resembled
a Dresden shepherdess in flowered pink and white and green
with harlequin ribbons in green and pink and a breath
less bonnet culminating in a big white poppy. The Earl of
Hopetoun, in becoming elephant’s breath and a long, limp
white vest that wanted filling out badly, stayed to the last
race with the Baron and Brother Rupert—who has got
back with a dimple in his cheek and a misfit hat. As for
the other people, Frances "Savi He wore Nile-green with
flounced side-panel and front, designed in tan silks, bonnet
en suite ; Lilian Seccombe, in a white fichu, buttercup
sash and collar, black and white hat, promenaded with
Eille Norwood. A visitor wore a charming confection—a
pearl-grey brocaded silk coat edged with moss-green and
twinkling with cut-steel buttons over a pleated skirt of
blush-pink chiffon. Bracy wore putty-colour and “-looked
nice as usual.” A Sydney belle in gladiator-red hooped
up with black braid, wore grey gloves and a green bow in
her hat; and the large, dropsical dams was dazzling in
green velvet combined with pink and green brocade and a
large pink bow on top of her sunshade. And then the
band played.
The “ official ” opening of the N.S.W. Agricultural
Show eventuated at Moore Park, on 3rd inst., when Gov.
Carington, accompanied by brother Rupert and a “ dis,
tinguished” following, set the misery in motion from some
carpet-oovered planks in the central pavilion iu a few
“ well-chosen ” words. And then we all went on an ex-
ploring tour after the exhibits, which appeared to consist
mainly of butter and horseflesh and a strong rustic per-
fume that wafted gently from the pig-pens, the denizens
of which, though not “ numerically strong,” as the re-
porters say, amply made up for it personally. Quite a
number of nice people visited the show for the opening,
but as the day was hot and muggy there were no new rags
to fondly admire or object to—the most striking get-up,
worn by a tall dark woman, being a pale-grey cloth, tailor-
built toque of scarlet poppies and scarlet moire gamp )
but the whole turn-out was distinctly last season's. And,
of course, the country contingent were there in t heir awe-
inspiring hats and boots and figures taking the usual
open-mouthed deep-breathing interest in separators and
other agricultural things that one would imagine they
would fly shrieking from whenever they got Hie chance.
Some people ling their chains, however, and I shall never
forget the victory in the eye of a tall, bony, angular lady
in lasting boors and a hair-net, accompanied by a revised
edition of a daughter, as she paused before a gaudy
bottle of jam, presumably the woik of a deadly district
rival, and pointed triumphantly to a spot of effervescence
at the top !
In the “Silver Falls,” now cascading at Sydney Royal,
one little thing shows the sound human basis of the play.
That is the dignified refusal of Lola Hernandez to eat a
piece of Primrose’s wedding-cake. When that cold-blooded
bride pursues her with some of the gritty horror on a
soup-plate, Lola rises to the awfulness of her peril and
waves the suicidal dose aside, while the house watches
breathlessly expecting that she will at last eat some and
curl up and die with poetical justice in full blast. There
is one gown in the “ Silver Falls,” worn by Edith Blande
in the first act—a yellow brocade lit up by sage-green. If
the tints weren’t so crude it would be “artistic.” As it
stands it is merely a nightmare of cheese and celery.
I would oft see the “ Sultan of Mocha ”
And join in the fun like a grig,
Were it not for that 6x4 parting
On Knight Aston’s property wig.
And my laugh would sound out every evening
And nothing could rouse me to wrath
If Forde’s flannel jupe as the “Pirate”
Wasn’t riddled by merciless moth.
A crowded house assembled at Sydney Theatre Royal,
on 7th inst., to hear the “ Silver Falls ” by intercolonial
vice-regal command. Whether it takes longer to “do”
Lady Hopetoun’s hair than it does to “ fix ” Lady Caring-
ton’s, deponent doesn’t know ; but anyway, the vice-regal
crowd were very late, for the first time in their long and
useful career in our midst. Lady Carington, who, appar-
ent!}*, hasn't troubled her dressmaker for some time, wore
pale-pink silk with high neck and long sleeves, relieved
with white lace, pink how and diamond aigrette in her
beautifully-arranged hair, pleated lace fan, diamond
bangles and pins, and cloak of acoordeon-pleated chiffon,
designed in pink and green, with demi-Medici collar
in pink and green velvet. The Countess of Hopetonn's
toilette was more involved. The long train was of grey
poplin with balayeuse of watermelon-pink over a plain
jupe of pink moire draped with pink ribbons. The bodice
cut very low at the back (by the way, the vice-regal
shoulder-blades didn’t quite justify the deed), was of pink
and grey artistically combined, with sleeves.below the
elbow and slightly fulled shoulders, flesh-pink gloves, a
pink gauze fan with crimson roses—diamond necklet—
gold-and-diamond hair-ornament, and a black velvet
and jet opera-cloak. Mrs. Aciaud-Hood wore simple white
silk with a white plume fan. The gentlemen were all in
plain evening dress, without one buttonhole! - amongst
them—audit was like going back a hundred years to see
“E.W.” looking as fresh as a two-year-old, sitting
Caere in his old accustomed chair beaming benignant!} - on
Hopetoun, who sat in the front row between Lady
Carington and his sister-in-law, and wore his hair parted
smoothly in the middle.
A city financier, the story goes, made violent love, the
other day, to a coloured nurse-girl, which heathen, in her
blindness, “ went for him,” with the result that the better
part of his whiskers adhered to her ebony fingers, and he
has been sailing under a clean shave ever since.
One outcome of the disastrous Queensland floods is the
establishment iu Brisbane of Hie “Flood Relief Society.”
The idea is to beg old garments of any kind from friends
and distribute them to those poor people whose ward-
robes are non est. Everything would be lovely if the
donations didn’t run so to old corsets. At a recent dis-
tribution one table was covered with stays of every con-
ceivable colour and every degree of unwashed wear, and
as the distressed applicants were mostly men, the show
was very funny indeed. But the benevolent ladies and
the parsons went home quite happy all the same.
“Garrick” and “coachman” capes are becoming
rather many in Sydney now, and, as the cheap Jacks have
them strung up by dozens in their windows at a shocking
sacrifice, I suppose Wolloomooloo will get there as usual.
So far as warmth goes yon might as well trot out in a big
collar as in one of these coverings. They don’t hit the
waist at all, and the influenza-laden breeze playeth
gently round you in a way to gladden the heart
of the chemist round the corner. And “ every,
body ” cannot wear them either. A slim damsel looks
like a reversed hay-rake attired in one, and the fat, brief
lady—but I cannot think without shuddering of what she
would look like in a frilled top wrap. Only a tall or
tallish woman of good proportion can hope to look any
advance on a scarecrow in a coachman’s cape.
I was looking at some of the new hats in a Sydney shop
the other day, and my great, deliberate verdict is that
they are all very old friends indeed. All the milliners
assure me they are the “very latest,” and that nothing
else will be worn this season but flapdoodle arrangements
in felt or straw or velvet that buck up on one side and
sag down on the other, with aggressive feathers and a
wing or two and a knot of velvet, but I cannot help
harbouring a base suspicion that the woman who expends
money on these hip-hip hoorayish topknots will find her-
self sadly out of it when the season is really in. It’s a
golden rule—if money is an object with you, of course—
never to indulge in riotous head-gear at the break of the
season, for shopkeepers are but mortal, and do sometimes

Attracted by the commencement of the season, Farm
Cove is now peppered with warships, whose commandahs
always have some weighty official reason to give for their
presence in Sydney when the waltz begins to turn and the
Lenten days are past, and the bookies’ shout of “ 10 to 1!’
which you don’t hear often—although I had £lOO to £5
against Mantilla for the Cup—floats down the autumn
blast. Then the officahs abound in glory gilded, and
begin the old round of ogle, spoon and flirt. That is, of
course, if they’ve got over the grippe which was rampant
when the Orlando left Melbourne.
Apropos to “ la grippe." There is more to be feared
from the blistering “ infalllhles ” forced on one by mis-
guided friends than from the trouble itself, I think. One
cure violently recommended to yours truly is, to blister
the back of your neck and plunge your pedestals in
scalding brine 1 Another is, to sniff salt up your raw
nostrils with a hot poultice round your diaphragm 1 While
a third—a preventive published in the S-M.H. —is, to dn
the “Block” with your nose smothered in Vaseline,
taking a camphor pill at stated intervals. Of course, the
“ Block ” isn’t the prescription. But I think I’d rather
sneeze ; wouldn’t you ?
In consequence of the death of Mrs. Allwood, wife of
Canon Allwood, that historical and always fashionable
event, the Sydney School of Industry ball, which was to
have been held on 29th inst., has been postponed until
May. The Sydney Re-unions commence the season ’9O at
West’s rooms on 25th inst.
On dit that Lady Carington will journey over to the

One brief glance at Her Majesty’s d.c. on sth inst,—the
premiere of “Nowadays” and William Rignold— and yours
ever girded up her opera-cloak and delved her way out
info the moonlight. Such a pot-pourri of bonnets and
hare shoulders i have never seen before, for the stalls had
over-run the reserved d.c. seats, and words can’t depict
the awesome time the ushers had of it. Through a
struggling sea of heads—some in big hats and feathers
which torture couldn't get them to- remove—l managed to
dimly comprehend that Kate Bishop—convalescent but
still very pale—occupied the managerial box with Mr. and
Mrs. Rignold, and wore flesh-tinted brocade, with dia,
monds and a scrumptious white plume fan; that the
Potts Point bride wore white -silk and pom-poms; that
our Frisky one mounted black, dodged up with greenery
yallery; and that Alice May, in the front row, affected
black and a big red flower. Then I vacated my stand in
favour of a crowded-out enthusiast and “ shoved.”
Fancy work is taking a decidedly bibulous turn nowa-
days, have you noticed ? We are accustomed to the
glorified gin-casket with its shoulders tied up with
ribbons, and the curacoa-bottle acting as “ancient tear-
jug” in a scrimmage of gold-paint and a beetle or two is
every day happening, but the very latest development of
the craze for alcoholic fancy-work is the champagne
pocket-tidy. This latest pocket aggravation is fashioned
out of the straw covers of fizz-bottles. You clip it as
smooth as your cheek, plait ribbon round the mouth to
make it hold, tie more ribbon round the middle, more in
loops and bows at the bottom, and with a piece of cord,
also beribboned, book on to the top to hang it up by, why
—there you arc. I must confess that the champagne-
tidy looks to me more like a birch-hroom with a head-
cold than a wall-'ornament, nevertheless it has its wor-
shippers.
The officers’ tent at South Head was on Good Friday
fairly besieged with visitors, Hie fair sex largely pre-
dominating. 1 a vain the gallant warriors hinted that they
weren’t “ settled yet,” the girls would not he denied and
declared they would excuse anything which was ex-
tremely kind, as they were uninvited, unexpected and
unwelcome guests. To show, however, that there was no
coolness, champagne and whisky flowed freely all day
long. A fisherman’s wife disturbed the neighbourhood at
sundown, declaring ihat she missed two of her best
roosters, and cast suspicious glances at the tents.

in Melbourne with the first importation or Cork butterl
has seen eight governors sworn in. Unless he shuffles off
shortly he will soon outdo Rider Haggard’s “She”—
“Even in our ashes lived their wonted fires,” and this ex-
quisite Melbourne Club man may still be seen in the front
row of the opera stalls with the other bald-heads.
From the S.M.H. ;
ATT*ANTED, situation as housemaid in respectable
" gentleman’s family. Six years in last employ-
ment in Sydney. Can produce highest references.
Address 24 Biaitk-street, Blank.
“ Respectable gentleman's family ” is excellent—and
necessary from a slavey’s point of view, since “No one is
a hero to his valet ” is now-a-days susceptible, from a
housemaid’s point of view, to a very free translation
indeed.
The players at a certain Melbourne theatre were, I am
told, much entertained between the agony recently by
the oanoodlings of an amorous couplet she, raven-
locked and obviously somebody's legal pansy-blossom;
he, small and devoted and blonde—who occupied a pro-
scenium-box. To exclude the vulgar curiosity of the
stalls they drew one of the box curtains only, leaving that
half which hid the stage tied hack. The consequence was
that through the curtain peep hole ribald Thespians gazed
hilariously at a raven-hairrd Venus and a Won le young
man trying to out-Rotter Mrs. P. and her Kyrle in the
clinging ardour of their embracings, while every fond
oscillatory peck the blonde Adonis placed in the mature
cheek of his Juliet was keenly criticised “behind.” You
see the average actor is a connoisseur at this kind of thing.
Quite a sizeable human aggregate assembled at Sydney
Temperance Hall,- on 27th ult., to sample a pot-pourri of
music and recitation inaugurated and carried out by girls
in aid of the Women’s College. As a rifle, your Sappho
shakes her moulded fists wrathful!} - at tabby troubles, but
this one wasn’t a bit sepulchral, and the fact that men
bristled in the audience atoned for their absence behind
the pretty fairy-lamp footlights. To say that organiser,
committee, secretary, stage-manager, and “star” were
united with cool Pooh-bah-ishness by Miss Mabel Portus
speaks libraries for the energy of that young lady, who
wore a very pretty pink gown— a/ac simile of that worn
by Mrs. Brough in “ Caste”— and refused several encores
for her really soothing recitations. A fashionable feature
was a banjo-duet by two young ladies in fancy dress.
The rest of the crowd must think out those compliments
of the deepest dye that space forbids your Sappho to
indulge in.
It was a thousand pities that tr-a-agediap Miln didn’t
hearken to the wise words of his admirers and postpone
his matinee ben. at Sydney Royal to a date less attractive
than the sth when the races and the show tempted folks
out of doors. There was a gruesome d.c. and only one
civilised get-up - of figures in China-blue, with forget-me-
nots bonnet, relieved with bows of heliotrope velvet, worn
by an amateur dramatic medico’s wife. The contrast of
mauve and blue was daring, but successful.

Toole’s first night at Melbourne Princess’s
bristled with signs that another venerable British
institution is likely to establish a large personal
popularity in Australia. Although he faced the
strange music in a character for which he was
obviously too elderly, the audience—or at any rate
the stalls and dress-circle people—received him
with a warmth that seemed to increase as the
evening wore on. It is true that a number of
enthusiastic fledglings had turned up with the
settled purpose of roaring at Toole, because they
thought it was the right thing - , dontoherknow,
which accounted for many bursts of inopportune
delight. To an older and fatter brigade of ad-
mirers Toole brought “the thoughts of other
years ” —memories that would have endeared the
grey and gentle jester to them quite irrespective
of his present powers to please. But the many
who essayed to sit in judgment on Toole, as a
comedian, briefly summed him up to be “a nice
old chap. ’ Coming before the curtain, with one
leg of his plush breeches gone wrong, to speak the
inevitable speech, Toole made no attempt to con-
ceal the fact that he is a nice old chap. As likely
as not—for the tact of John Laurence T. is pro-
verbial—he purposely allowed the sexagenarian to
stand very much revealed at that particular mo-
ment. Anyway, he knocked them with his carefully
simple address, and every member of the audience
regarded him as a long-lost uncle on the spot.
Whether successive crowds will continue to
enthuse over a succession of farces, played in a
theatre where some of the actor’s quietest humour
gets lost, is still open to doubt. If none of the
coming pieces were stronger than “ Ohawles ” the
question would be open to grave doubt. There is
certainly a thought running through the three
thin acts of “Ohawles,” but this trifle by IT. J.
Byron contains less real fun than the concluding
farce of “ Ici on Parle Francais,” which the im-
ported company rattled through with a decision
born of long practice together. In “Ici” the
necessity for importing Toole’s staff became evi-
dent. Neither programme, however, included a
part for John Billington, but the boss’s first
lieutenant is to appear with the first of the weekly
changes on Saturday next,
* « *
If the hand of Time has touched Mr.
Toole rather hard of late, it has not injured the
actor in the main. Less active than he used to be,
he is also less fussy and assertive. Many Lon-
doners were wont to complain that Toole was too
obtrusive in his farces, and esteemed him more as
a comedian of the best school than as a stage
funny-man. But his method now-a-days is so soft
and kindly that the multiplicity of his farewell
banquets can be at once accounted for by those
who know him only in his professional capacity.
From under light tow wigs beams the gray and
gentle jester—this last expression being suffi-
ciently neat to deserve repetition. Those of
the assisting company who appeared on Satur-
day seemed not remarkable for anything
in particular, and none of them possess
historic interest with the exception of Miss Char-
lotte Saunders, an actress sure to make friends
when she gets a better show. She was the original
fat jockey-boy in “Flying Scud,” fated to fall in
love when he had to ride under six-stone two.
Miss Irene Vanbrugh, reported to be the daughter
of a bishop or something of that kind, has the re-
commendation of being a mild reminder of Miss
Lilian Gilmore when she talks, but otherwise she
doesn’t resemble that vanished angel at any point .
*m * *
But it grieves us deeply to have to say
that the g-enial Johnny Toole is indeed a fine
old crusted specimen of the London snob. An
upper servant at Windsor Castle, one grown grey
in the service of royalty, couldn’t have prattled
away with a more sublime unconsciousness of his
begroveiled condition than did Johnny T. to an
Adelaide reporter : “ Here’s a point for you,” says
the great man, “ I was going to keep it as a bomb
for myself to deliver on my opening night. Now,
put it as delicately as possible. His Royal High-
ness told me that he would very much like to come to
A ustralia, but the distance ■prevented him at pre-
sent.'' Having delivered himself of which miser-
able twaddle Toole leaned back in his chair and
was astonished to find that the reporter didn’t
burst into a flood of grateful tears. In default of the
anticipated emotion Toole then pointed a trembling
finger at Tummy’s picture on the cabin wall and
sobbed on his own account. Poor Johnny ! Many
years of acting before a little clique in a little
theatre, and a long succession of little suppers,
gilded by little speeches from little lordships, have
narrowed his mind until he can actually dream of
witching Australia with the news that a fat,
uninteresting human satire on the vaunted com-
mon-sense of England would very much like to
come, but he can’t. Toole, however, hadn’t been
talked to by Arthur Garner when he so innocently
flaunted his flunkeyism. In the future he will
keep it for Toorak and Potts’ Point, we guess, and
be made to understand that Tummy is not a name
to conjure with.in any theatre where the manhood
of Australia is fairly represented.

George Coppin, in company with the
veteran G. B. W. Lewis, was walking up Collins-
street, Melbourne, last Thursday afternoon, when
another youthful old ’un slapped him on the back
and addressed him by name. “ I haven’t the
pleasure,” began the Hon. George when the
stranger winked six times in rapid succession, and
said: “What, don’t you remember Johnny
Toole ?” Then Coppin did remember Johnny—
whom he hadn’t seen for 24 years, by the way—
and they all turned into the Oriental Hotel, and
drank to the good old times when they both used
to play Paul Pry, and when Madame Celeste
raged in broken English at the Adelphi, and
Toole was best known aa the hero of poor Paul
Bedford’s “I believe yer, me bo-o-y !” Where
are Bedford, Ben Webster, Buckstone, Sothern,
Compton, Chippendale, Charles Matthews, Phelps,
and a dozen others whose names were household
words when Coppin and Toole last met? —
“ All are departed ;
All, all are gone, the old familiar faces.”

Bay. Somebody said he was ill, but wo fancy
this was Pickwickian or theatrical indisposition.
At night Warner acted the ardous double part
of Laroquc and Luversan in “A Man’s Shadow,”
Nor would the plea of rehearsal avail, because
several actors from the Royal were on board the
steam-launch Sprightly, The fact may be that
dear Charley doesn’t welcome dear Johnny over-
much just now. It is purely a question of busi-
ness. Here is Charley Warner shuffled off from
the luxurious Princess’s to the barn-like Royal,
from the best theatre in Australia to one of the
worst, first to make way for Mrs, Potter and Kyrle
Bellew, and then for dear old Johnny Toole. It
is always recognised that Williamson and Garner
put their best leg forward at the Princess’s.
Therefore Warner is their second-best leg. The
bloom is off the peach. Naturally ho is off-
colour in comparison with such booming novelties
as “ Paul Jones,” the Bijou opening, and the
great little “ Johannes,” When they meet again
in London they’ll be as thick as ever, and John
won’t have to ask, “ Where’s Chawles?”
•Sr #
The Williamson and Garner firm advertised
that “ a stupid clique of nobodies endeavoured, by
libellous statements, to injure the prospects of the
brilliant season of Mrs. Potter and Kyrle Bellew”
in Melbourne. A very ill-considered declaration
on the part of the firm, firstly because “nobodies ”
couldn’t possibly injure the prospects of any
season, and secondly, because it naturally suggests
an enquiry as to why somebody does not sue the
clique for defamation of character ? But probably
the firm was only poking borak at Melbourne,
seeing they congratulate themselves that the
“ success” was “attainedlegitimately and without
any of the advertising claptrap, gush, and twaddle
too often inflicted upon the public.” Surely the
managerial Garner did not intend that sentence
as a serious reflection upon a faithful—not to say
abjectly devoted—daily press? It was all a joke,
the point of which was sharpened by a letter
which Pnrves wrote to Mr. Garner re Toole’s
reception luncheon. Pnrves said : “You know
how much I looked forward to welcoming the
good old actor from ‘home.’ and how much I
should have liked to have differentiated him from
the sorry procession of tailor-clad women and
dressmaker-dad men, posturers and barbers’ blocks,
who come demanding a welcome they do not
deserve.” After reading which, The Bulletin
would like to know what the firm’s advt. meant,
and what the Q. C. was referring to ; also, whether
the libellous clique includes Purves ?

The tremendous ovation allotted to Wil-
liam Rignold on his first Australian appearance,
at Sydney Her Majesty’s, was highly compli-
mentary to the reputation _of both brothers, and
prophetic also of the big hit afterwards made by
the later arrival. “ Now-a-Days,” a sporting
drama whose plot, like that of “Flying Scud,”
turns on the abduction of a Derby favourite, un-
like most modern melodramas is not written round
its strong situations, but so constructed that these
seem to spring naturally from surroundings. It is
without doubt the strongest piece of stage-craft of
its kind that has lately come Sydney-wards, and
in making this statement we are backed up by
public opinion, for an enormous house lustily ap-
plauded every point and enthusiastically called
the leading performers before the curtain at the
close of each act. William Rignold, a man
several sizes larger than his brother, George, is a
very fine actor and well-suited with a part. His
performance of Jack Saxton, the giant Yorkshire-
man and coal-mine owner, was to us like the revival
of a lost art, for no new-comer of late years has
visited these shores with such a consistently good
provincial accent, with a personality so admirably
adapted to his impersonation, and such an un-
doubtedly faithful conception of the manner i n which
an unpolished, careful, yet good-hearted countryman
would conduct himself in varying circumstances.
As Sir Harry Croydon, H. R. Jewett has once
more to tackle the polished villain, and this time
he plays it for all the part is worth, and gets
soundly hissed for his pains. A. E. Greenaway’s
Tom Saxton is a well-balanced, carefully-thought-
out, and meritorious performance. Mr. Hazlitt,
as Gabriel Harper, agreeably surprised us; Joe
Tolano, as “Shandygaff,” a black-leg, is fitted to-
the life; as the “Baby,” his partner in crime,
J. W. Sweeney most effectually conceals his iden-
tity; Stirling Whyte has an admirable drunken
scene as Bookmaker Dowling; Frank Harcourt,
as the German waiter, makes a hit; and for the
first time, as Bob the Jockey, Frank Ayrton gives
an Australian audience a good idea of his private
identity. Walter Rivers and Guyton Heath, as
Jockeys, are to be highly commended —in fact,
William Rignold seems to have inspired his
confreres with a share of his own admirable
vigour and enthusiasm. Miss Bessie Rig-
uold’s performance is more remarkable for the
possibilities of future excellences displayed than
for their “ Now-a-Days ” manifestation ; as Jenny
Dowling, Roland Watts-Phillips was clear in
enunciation and more than equal to every emer-
gency ; Madge Seymour, as Kitty, takes another
step forward in public estimation ; and 3lay Ellis,
in a small part, showed signs of future successes
as a soubrette. “Now-a-days ” might have been
much better staged ; some of the scenery we have
seen before, and the back-cloth in the: race-scene
was either so skimpy or so ill-covered by wings
that its “ prompt ” edge could be easily seen from
the O.P. side of the circle. Nevertheless, it will
be a very big “go.”
## * &
The good old “Private Secretary” bobbed
up serenely on Faster Monday at the renovated
Sydney Gaiety, in the presence of a large and
appreciative audience. Messrs. Tubbs and Biggs
met with a good reception, but Sydney folks seem
to have almost forgotten that sterling actress,
Annie Taylor, once a great favourite. Frank
Thornton has apparently added some new phases
of facial misery to his performance, and, as his
allusions to “crodio influedza” have now a point
that they never had before, ho takes the audience
with him from start to finish, just as surely as he
does his go-loshes. H. R. Harwood’s irritability
as Catterrnolo, like Thornton’s agility in settee-
clearing, is not so marked as of yore, but he has
got several new “ gags, ” and therefore gets there
just the same. The performance of Frank Cates,
as Cattermole the younger, has all the clearness,
the correctness of a stereo.: we failed to see a new
point in it. “ Chai'ley ” Brown’s “ Tailor Gibson ”
is as good as ever, Eille Norwood’s nervous huski-
ness deprived him somewhat of the big success
that would have been made otherwise by his
“Bird Song,” and I’. 0. Corlesse is bearable as
Mr. MJr si and. As for the ladies, Annie Taylor’s
Miss Ashford is up.to previous sample; Ada Lee
gets there with both feet as Edith Maryland, and
the Misses Brenton -and Gibson are even less
paralysingly successful than we anticipated. Our
old friend “ Kitts ” is in front, and a big six weeks
is seemingly in store for the little theatre.
* * *
With his perennial pertinacity. Frank M.
Clark returns hither, and dumps down a well-
assorted load of performers in our midst. The
latest importation, named the Boston Ideal Com-
pany, was submitted for public approval at the
Opera House on Saturday evening last. The first
parcel to hand consisted of Messrs. Burns and
Donnelly, who were pervaded by a strong Hiber-
nian flavour. Burns carries a face about with
him that is a cross between M‘Ginty’s and an
indiarubber shoe, and he works it to laughable
advantage. With several apologies to Alfred
Bennett for infringement of copyright, we may
say that their act “took well, and gave great
pleasure to all.” The clever colonial comedian,
Will Whitburn, has been sandwiched between
Boston and Australia, and contributes some items
with success,, including a song, written and com-
posed by Lance Lenton, entitled the “ Larrikin’s
Hop.” Miss May Yohe, who owns an excellent
contralto voice, diversified matters with an
Amurrkan valse song, albeit she was dressed in
Oriental costume. Franks and Marion made
things boom along in their specialty, intermixed
with acrobatic dancing. Then came Ellwood, who
is a male soprano in petticoats and bustle to match.
Many in the audience were puzzled as to his, her, or
its sex, but the performer eventually solved the
conundrum by emitting a couple of bass whoops
and doffing his head-gear. “Fat” M. Clark
next hove in sight, supporting a blonde wig and
a brunette moustache, and allowed three songs to
escape from his bronchial tubes to the delight of
the audience. After his retirement the Tudors
reigned, thus upsetting the hitherto historical
fable that the House of Tudor ended with the
decease of Queen Elizabeth. They ran a tinpot
band and indulged in a sword combat while flog-
ging the stage with clogs. The curtain finally
fell upon a really funny farce, “ The Foiled
Mashers,” in which Burns and Franks, as an
Irishman and a German respectively, convulsed
the house with their vagaries. Taken throughout,
the Boston Ideal Show is a good one.

11l the second act of “ Silver Falls
at Sydney Royal there is a beautiful scene
by Brunton of distant hills, lightly veiled by
a haze of summer heat, rising from behind a
fine, bold foreground of rocks that is per-
haps too highly tinted in the middle distance.
E. B. Russell, ” whose Jacob M'Closky was the
chief feature of the “ Octoroon,” makes the most
of a small part, as does C. B. Westmacott, also an
“Octoroon” success, with Sheriff Dixon. In
Bob Maguire, G. R. Melville has about the only
loveable male character in the play, and he fills
the bill. Clara Cowper improves very much on
acquaintance, Pollie Emery’s brogue clings to her
more tightly than on the first night, and the little
woman is now quite a favourite. Assisted by the
holidays, the “ Silver Falls ” will just struggle
through its allotted period.

“ The Sultan of Mocha,” at Sydney
Criterion, has hit the public taste. The Pen-
sioner’s Chorus is now in high favour, and the
dancing of Tilly Lake and her mate in the sailor’s
hornpipe, is much admired, though the general
opinion is that the ballet, no matter how attired,
is “ a bit off” on the light fantastic. The princi-
pals continue in good form, and “Mocha” will
probably be served up for another fortnight.

Since John F. Sheridan, the only one and
indivisible Widow O’Brien, first fluttered in this
part of the globe with that vehicle for variety
vagaries styled “ Fun on the Bristol,” several
imitators have sprung into ephemeral existence.
Sheridan, as the amorous Widow, is as sparkling
as champagne, but “John F.” Williams, with
his servile imitation, is as dull as a long-
drawn Woolloomooloo beer. Frank Smith
has certainly staged the piece well at Sydney
Standard, and the redeeming features in the
representation are personified in Martin Hagan,
Arthur Farley, F. Walton and Perry Ryan.
Among the weaker sex Vera Patey and Lulu
Ryan occasionally coruscate. A weighty hank
of olio business spreads itself widely over the
second act of this long-opened histrionic oyster,
and a good helping of marmalade fails on the
platters of the Sisters Blair for their vocal and
terpsichorean duettising. The Leslie Bros., about
the best in their line ever seen or heard here,
are no “fakers,” but play in a musicianly
manner on many instruments.

The benefit of G. C. Mila at Sydney Royal
last Saturday was financially a failure, chiefly
begguse the day (Cup-day) was ill-chosen. Artisti-
cally, the violin solos of Mons. Poussard was the
most successful item on the programme, and next
in merit to our mind came the charming perform-
ance of Clara Cowper as the young girl in “Darby
and Joan.” Most of the Royal company with-
drew from the bill, annoyed by the manner in
which they were lumped together, while one of
their number was “starred ” in aggressively large
capitals. The Forum scene from “Julius Caesar” 1
was creditably staged and well worked-up by Mr.
Miln’s company, considering the short space of
time available for preparation, but his reading of
Marc Antony’s oration was not by any means a
good one, and H. N, Douglas’ innovation in
reading his speech from a scroll, as Brutus, seemed
to us purposeless and clumsy.
Ttf Iff
Her Majesty's (Sydney ) was crammed to
the dour on Good Friday night, when Hazon's
orchestra, Frances Savilie, Mrs. Vauderveer-
Green, William Walshe, and “Daddy” Halle-
well gave a high-class entertainment. We think
that the “March of the Israelites,” from Costa’s
“Eli,”, was the event of the evening, but the
overture to the “ I Promessi Sposi” of Ponchielli
received quite an ovation ; Schumann’s exquisite
“ Traumerei ” had to be repeated, and the “Funeral
March of Ophelia” (Facoio) was magnificently
played. The tender and delicate “ Ave Maria,”
from Verdi’s “Otellu,” beautifully rendered by
France's Savilie, was encored, and the vocal quar-
tette, “ God is a Spirit,” from Sterndale Bennett’s
“Woman of Samaria,” deserved and received a
similar compliment. The concert was managed
by Mr. Churchill-Otton, a gentleman who, unlike
most managers, does not obtrude himself on public
notice.

Sa\ e for a vast expanse of desolate dress-
circle, matters looked bright at Melbourne Royal on
Saturday, when Charles Warner sought solace for
his recent failure by flying to “ Drink.” The un-
wholesome old perversion of Zola’s novel is played
by many of the people who supported the plumber
aforetime, but, as a few changes are rather in a
downward direction, “Drink” is not likely to
howl.

what above the average, so that Manager Davis

Bijou, a delightful temple of art that seems to be
nearer Heaven than it was, and is led up to by
several festive flights of marble steps, received a
noble inauguration on Saturday night. Paunchy
legislators, wreathed in condescending smiles,
were scattered about in reckless profusion, feasting
their beery eyes upon a scene which will ever Lve
in the memories of such as had booked an elegant
plush-seat beforehand. Briefly, the Bijou is a
smart, roomy, brilliantly-lighted house, situated
on a gentle slope, so that the sweet maiden
with a preposterous hat on her fair young
brow doesn’t induce the man behind to pray
that she will fall a lifeless corpse every time
he wishes to discover what it’s all about.
Mr. Spong’s drop-curtain is a radiant item in
the general joy, and the comfort of patrons has
been studied, etcetera, by the enterprising thin-
gummy. With all these things in its favour,
“ Money ” is not likely to result in a long-sustained
rush to the new theatre. Even Messrs. Brough
and Boucicault’s clever company can show no good
reason for reviving a worn-out aphorism that
walks on stilts through five acts. The character-
sketches with which the padded author pleased a
past generation seemed very commonplace to-day,
while the chief character was always a hero who
wanted kicking, like his artistic relative,
Claude Melnotte. An opinion that all the
old favourites have played to better advan-
tage was generally expressed, and as their
merits have been acknowledged in The Bulletin
every week throughout a long season in Sydney, it
is only necessary to record the fact that their Mel-
bourne reappearance in “Money” was not the
immense success it might have been. Mr. Percy
Lyndal fell especially flat as Alfred Evelyn, a
mawkish prig who can only be made endurable by
a vigorous leading juvenile with a florid gushing
style. Mr. Lyndal, in this unsuitable character,
suggests a chemist or a curate. Mr. J. E. Cath-
cart, as Sir John Yesey, is too fond of taking
three tragedy strides after he Iras tried to make a
point at the wrong place, and, take it altogether,
“ Money ” requires all the popularity of B. and 8.,
and the novelty of its surroundings, to keep the
show going.

Meanwhile “Paul Jones ” continues to cut
the record at Melbourne Opera House. It is
stated and believed—a most mrusual conjunction
of circumstance! —that the first six nights pro-
duced £lBOO, so the quality of the notes that come
from Nellie Stewart’s chest grows richer every
night. She seldom sings less than a “tenner”
now, but Woodfield, somehow, fails to get off as
much tenor as is expected of him. Au contrairey,
as the Chinese say, Aggie Kelton has picked up
enough of her voice to get an encore for “ Look at
my Sabots! ” a delicious song and chorus
which might be changed into “I am such an
artless thing ” if they want to show where
Plauquette struck his idea. Madame Burton,
Snazelle, Leitch, and everybody else improve on
acquaintance, like square-gin. As for the chorus,
they bang creation altogether. They never wait
to be introduced to notice by the plot, but just
tear on when the heart sighs for ’em and scoot
before they have made even the men tired. Now,
fellers grow weary of surveying forests of legs
much quicker than their female relations do.
Mrs. Dampier and Miss Lily returned to
their places in ‘ ‘ Robbery Under Arms ” on Satur-
day, whereby Melb. Alexandra was stimulated to
wilder enthusiasm than usual. The Cogills broke
out into a fresh atrocity, called “Drunk,” at St.
George’s Hall; General Mite staggered bucolic
pilgrims at the Waxworks, and the Oyclorama
was having a holiday time of it.

The new Gaiety, a hall that seems far
more of a theatre than most of its fusty rivals in
Melbourne, absorbed some ten or twelve hundred
followers of the immortal Harry Rickards on
Saturday. The Rickards show is certain to
flourish here for a large quantity of reasons, one
of them being that the accommodation is run on
the “one man one seat” —comfortable seat —
system, instead of providing for two men and a
boy on ten inches of hard plank with no back to it.

Five minutes of the Rev. Charles Clarke,
at Melbourne Town Hall, satisfied his friends
that he is the same fascinating dealer in fact,
flavoured with tictr n, who shovelled in the shekels
of the godly and-ungodly alike a dozen years ago.
The failures of many succeeding lecturers have
been bold advertisements for Mr. Clarke, and his
second innings in this country ought to beat the
first—-if he doesn’t spoil things by spouting Im-
perial Federation. Nevertheless it opened rather
tamely on Saturday. R. S. Smythe, who is alleged
to be deeply versed in religious lore, should have
recommended his principal to lie low during Passion
week,

A mere handful of glowering humanity
lurched into Melbourne Royal on Saturday after-
noon to see Professor Miller take the starch, if he
had any left, out of Duncan Ross, a large, robust
person who set up here as a champion athlete of
the world, and has been failing in the business
about once a week since. The gladiators wrestled
Graeco-Roman style for a weird, shadowy stake
of £2OO. After a furious series of struggles the
Professor wrenched Ross’s arm until it came par-
tially out of gear, whereupon Monsieur Victor
trod the damaged limb back into position as well
as he could, and everybody concerned showed a
disposition to shed each other’s gore. But Miller,
it transpired, had won the match by breaking the
other man’s arm, just as poor drink-destroyed
Whistler used to break his arm, and when this
was explained a great cheer burst from about 40
throats, and Miller went off full of joy at having
won tho hazy sum aforementioned.

Dear Bulletin, —In your last week’s issue there appeared
a par. anent the New Zealand novelist, B. L. Farjeon,
by which it would appear that he is unmindful in his pro-
sperity of his brother—an actor —who is impoverished.
Allow me to inform you for a fact that Farjeon has on
several occasions paid his brother’s passage home, having
forwarded money for the purpose, but the brother has
neglected to avail himself in that and other directions of
the proffered kindness.-— ln The Know,
Thus Spagnoletti:—“l saw Toole for the first time on
Wednesday. Garner was showing him round the Block.
Toole is much smaller than I expected, apparently little
over five feet, but he loses height through a considerable
kink in his left leg, which makes him very lame. He was
dressed in an easy old brown sac-suit and brown soft felt
hat.”
The Revue des Deux Mondes, just, to hand, lias a
glowing reference to Madame Melba’s Lucia di Lammer-
uioor, from the pen of M. Bellaigue. It is the more valu-
able as being truly critical, not the familiar slaver and
puffery. While praising Madame Melba, the critic, well
known as the best in Paris, walks unmercifully into the
absurdly incongruous costumes of the opera, and the ridi-
culous tropical scenery in Scotland !
Paris critics “ slate” Madame Melba for shaking hands
with the leader of the orchestra when called before the
curtain after “ Lucia di Lammermoor.” They suggest
that she ought rather to have shaken hands with M. ,
Taffanel, the flautist, who accompanied her so magnifi-
cently through the mad scene. The star had better go
round and shake hands with all the people in the boxes.
The Toole luncheon at the Melbourne Oriental, just
fetched up a squad of actors and the familiar identi-
ties who may come under the general designation of
His Gills,” always ready for suction when the chain, is
about. Hopetoun don’t seem to emulate my dear friend,
Tummy.
That fine, mellow actor, John Billington, has accom-
panied Toole to Australia. He was stage-struck through
seeing Maeready in the “ King of the Commons.” Thirty-
years ago John was the Birmingham star. Then he got
to the Adelphi, under Webster, and bore his share in the
“Green Bushes,” “Flowers of the Forest,” and ail those
pieces. His John Peerybingle is Al, and in this he will
support Toole’s Caleb Plummer. His Col. Hardy in “Paul
Pry” will be another treat, and he has good parts in “The
Upper Crust” and nearly all Toole’s pieces. His
wife is an admirable actress, "but does not visit Australia.
Billington is fine and large, a real manly fellow, of the
Henry Edwards stamp.
Influenza—Russian, of course—is russian about the
Alexandra. “ We’ve all had it,” is the popular song of
the day. Which accounts for pretty and clever Rita
Wyndale successfully tackling the part of Kate Morrison,
in “Robbery Under Arms,” vice Mrs. Darnpier, ■ in-
disposed.
The Bijou in all its glory promises to rival the
Princess’s, in all but one respect—that of dressing-
room accommodation for the company. As usual, the
unfortunate artistes have been overlooked by tire
anxious architect. In revenge, the artistes from thei r
inaccessible heights over the “flies” can overlook the
Anxious Architect, which his name is Johnson.
Sir Robert Mayne, the London Chief Commissioner,
once said that if a man came naked on the stage the
police had no direct authority to interfere. He evidently
thought it unnecessary to protect the nudes of the other
sex from the prudish policeman.
Miss Helen Kinnaird was the first actress in Australia to
go down with the “ grip.” That’s something to accom-
plish.
Arthur Garner has sent a sympathetic letter to Doctor
Neild in re the severance of his connection with the Aus-
tralasian.
According to the Hvoao News there is a single lady in
Japan whose dimensions would prove attractive to a well-
known Sydney gentleman who revells at a distance in
quantities of female. She is over Bft. in height, weighs
twenty-four stones, the sole of her foot is seventeen
inches wide, the palm of her hand thirteen, and she is
only sixteen years old ! She is also perfectly well-propor-
tioned and in no way gives the idea of being over-grown.
Fred. W. Millis receives much jam from the Edinburgh
press for his ventriloquia! performances at the Moss’
Theatre of Varieties.
George Darrell falls foul of Austin Brereton’s statement
that there are and have been no Australian dramatists. A
correspondent sends us a list in which are included the
names of Darrell, Marcus Clarke, Akhurst, Garnet Walcb,
Hopkins, Cooper, R. P. Whitworth, “Demos” Palmer,
“Tommy ” Walker, Fergus Hume, Haddon Chambers, and
Lance Lenton.
J. L. Toole’s father was the civic toast-master in London.
His professional career began, under Chas. Dillon, at the
Queen’s Theatre, Dublin. At Edinburgh he became
acquainted with Irving, when they were stock actors
together in Wyndham’s company. Toole got an engage-
ment at the St. James’s, London, managed by Mrs. Sey-
mour, who afterwards kept house for" Chas. Reade, the
novelist. Dillon then gave Toole a better opening at the
Lyceum, where he opened the same night as Marie Wilton,
afterwards Mrs. Bancroft. The pieces were “ BeJpliegor ”
and “ Perdita Burlesqued.” Toole replaced Wright at the
Adelphi, as Paul Bedford's companion. Then he mounted
to a regular star. He and Irving have not acted together
for very many years, save when, on the eve of Irving
going to America, they acted as Robert Macaire and
Jacques Strop.
We read that Miss Prescott, an American actress,
played lago lately in New York. Rose Evans, Miss Cleve-
land, Louise Pomeroy, Cushman, and a number of other
women, have played Hamlet, but we haven’t heard of a
lady lago before. Mrs. Webb, 90 years ago, used to play
Falstafl in England. Charlotte Cushman’s Romeo was
equal to any man’s. Miss Prescott, as lago, suffered from
her remarkably fine feminine shape, which it was impos-
sible to hide. Otherwise she well delineated the subtlty
of lago.
Buffalo Bill’s Wild West Show is starring in Rome, and
is to appear in the Colosseum ! Rome is placarded all
over with ins show-bills, in Barunmesque style. He will
be in Australia next year.
Bancroft annoys playgoers who love illusion by taking
a call before the curtain just after he has been killed by
Irving at the end of the third act of the “ Dead Heart.”
He ought to remain extended on the stage, and so take
his call with the curtain lifted. He might twiddle his
toe in recognition or wag his ear.
Madame Marian Burton is vaguely understood to be a
“native,” like Nellie Stewart, Aggie Kelton, and Ida
Osborne. If this bo the case then the Melbourne Opera
House advts. should include a reference to the quartette
of Delicious Native Ladies.
The new drapery in front of the vice-regal box at Mel-
bourne Opera House effectually blocks the view of people
sitting anywhere behind. The space between the gauze
dad pillars was completely filled up with a huge shock of
silver hair on the first night of “ Paul Jones.” People
behind said it belonged to Parkes, and forthwith fell to
discussing his poetry and its effect on Federation.
Did you ever read “ Shakespeare’s England,” by William
Winter, the New York theatrical critic ? It is delicious.
Edmund Yates calls in question the statements made
about Dickens having foretold Irving’s greatness, and
incidentally treats of the humbug in general of raking up
such fancied predictions. In company with Dickens,
Yates saw Irving act Rawdon Scudamore in “Hunted
Down,” and Dickens said, “ That is an excellent imperso-
nation. The man reminds me of your father.” CresWick,
Phelps and Hoskins (the latter Irving’s dramatic tutor)
claim to have discerned the coming Irving, but Creswick
and Phelps were in management while he was starving !
Certainly Billy Hoskins did something for him, for which
Irving remembered his widow. Yates’ father was manager
of the Old Adelphi, London.
A London theatrical paper advertises fur an editor, who
must, according to advertisement, possess “consummate
ability, elegant and polished style, cultured taste, and

“Only for Company.”
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Joz the Marine told me that he only drank for
company’s sake. A lot of company! Joe swearing
at one end and German Charlie suffering a re-
covery at the other end of the Mount Tophet
hotel’s verandah ! I drink because I like whisky.
Johnny P , the trainer, is like his horses —he
drinks when he is thirsty, and then nothing
stronger than tea. To Mount Tophet with com-
pany, always excepting that of my dog. My
present one is called by the soul-reviving name of
“Presbyterian,” but he answers to “Jock” for
short. And now I can let you know why I keep
the Calvinistic “messan” —only for company. I
love any dog of whatever breed, because when
someone first loved me I had a pup, and such a
pup; let’s see, what was her name? —ah ! “ Cam-
buskenneth,” again a long name, so we called her
“ Cara.”
I.
In the year 1864 I visited the old abbey of
Cambuskenneth, and proceeded to inspect its
beauties. For miles around there is nothing to
compare to them, unless, indeed, they have
changed by evolution. What are the Stirling
wonders and those of St, Ninians and Bannock-
burn to the miracles nursed and storied for some
hundred years ? Never have I, and lam a judge,
seen anything to compare to the breed of wiry
terriers, formerly only to be found in the little
village of Cambuskenneth —and here let me tell
you once for all that in Scotland all words begin-
ning with Cambus, meaning “a bend,” are pro-
nounced as if spelt Cams. At any rate, I went
to Geordie Gray’s cottage and purchased the pet
and christened her “Cam.” Geordie always had
good whisky, and his wife with a solemn face gave
the purchaser a “gless for luck.” Just as I was
returning the quech, the old lady said to me,
“ Yon lass wad dae for yee.” I looked and saw
what I see now, hourly, daily, nightly, whenever
I pat a cur on the head or piek up a pup or hear a
yelp; there in front of my second-sighted eyes
stands Mary Kenneth, only daughter of Kenneth
of Kipponkenneth.
There is a bawbee toll or half-penny ferry
between the Abbey and the shore of Stirling. The
ferryman had advised ms to buy “Cam.,” and was
smiling with delight when I stepped into the boat
and seated myself in the stern beside Miss
Kenneth.
“ Isna’ she pairfect, Maister Phul. ?” “ Truly
said, Joek,” I reply, “ she is simple perfection. I
never saw anything like her.” All this time I
was staring at the lady and she was looking at
“ Cam.”
‘ ‘ Her pedigree’s as long as your’s; her skin’s as
soft as velvet; her een are like stars, and her tem
per, gentle as a doo's ; but, in a fechby, dinna anger
her. For shs’ll snarl and whusk that bit tail o’
hers. '
“ What the -what are you talking about, Jock?”
“The pup, sir. Wnatelse? What did ye think
I was pen tin tae ye?”
“Well, Jock.” said I, “until you mentioned
her tail I was thinking of —”
Then a lady chipped in—“ Please hand me out,
Mr. Philip, for I know your name, although I
have never been introduced to you.” And I
walked up the shore road with Miss Mary and
carried “Cam.”
111.
It was love and my turn to play; I tried a side-
shot. “ You know my name because Jack called
me Phul, and you know my name in full by in-
ference, because you must have heard of even
humble me, probably the only Philip within miles
of the Abbey Craig; and I now know yours
because of the black eyes and Egyptian beauty ;
excuse my plain-speaking, Miss Kenneth, but my
people, the women of them, inherit it also from
the gipsy * Alexanders.’ ”
“ Then we are relatives, or, as Jock would call
it, ‘ far awa freens.” Nevertheless if I met you on
a desert island and had never seen you before I
should know you for a Frandy of Glenfrandy,”
and she laughed.
lam slow of speech like Aaron, and had come
to the cross street before I asked what there could
be in my tout ensemble to stamp me as a man from
near the Oohics.
“ Well,” said she, “I’ll tell you, Mr. Frandy, I
have never yet seen a Frandy wear any clothes
but shepherd’s plaid. The size of the check and
quality of the cloth seem to be the only variations
that climate and visits to Edinburgh entail. They
have always a dog or two after them when
mounted and carry pups as other gentlemen carry
canes. Tiny don’t smoke, and -dear, oh ! dear me,
they DO fancy they are somebody. Perhaps I
should say somebodies.”
“ There’s nothing,” I answered, “ very bad in
all that. The Frandies are, you know ”
Here she laid her head on “ Cam,” and said
quickly: “ Don’t, please don’t, givens the pedi-
gree. Pa says your father has shot it at him for
50 years. I know it by heart. The gravestones
at Tullyochil are crammed with it. Spare me,
Philip, 1 mean Mr. Phil.”
“ Well, it is a consolation to rae that you have
taken to learn it, because you know that like this
pup’s, »s Jock says, it’s as long as yours, and if it
were not for the caution he gave rae as to temper
I should like to say more.”
We had been standing at the corner of the
street. Alister McAlister, of the militia, being
five feet in height and wearing a claymore as long
as himself, had bowed in passing, but Miss Ken-
neth had not noticed him. The Trossaohs ama-
teur coach had galloped by in feeble imitation of
the late Ramsay, of Barnton. It was time for
lunch. I could hear the bugles in the castle.
Daft Bobby Chalmers was interviewing us for a
bawbee, and still I waited for the girl to speak.
At last, very seriously, she almost whispered :
“ Say it.”
There was no Aaron about me this time. Three
words did it effectively.
“I love you.”
You’d hardly believe it, I did not expect it and
was staggered by the rapidity with which she
said, “ I love your dog and —its owner.”
This was the beginning of my only passion
(barring that for “ dugs ”). In my next chapter
I’ll tell you the practical end.
IV.
Six months afterwards Mary Kenneth married
Lord Blairhill, now Earl of Airnsbrae.
V.
Since “ Cam.” grew up and produced litters of
young “ Cams.,” of which “Jock,” alias “Pres-
byterian,” is the lineal descendant, I have visited
Europe, Asia, and the other continents. But
Mary is always there when I see a dog. I have
had, I know not how many, Marys, Maries,
Mollies, Molls, Pollies, Polls, but always one of
the tribe. I lost the strain once when they refused
to ship “Craigie” from Annesley Bay to Suez
during the Abyssinian business, but Geordie Gray
supplied me with “ Abercromby ” (Crummy), and
I started afresh.
VI.
And that is all, except that not so long ago I
met Lady Airnsbrae shopping in a colonial city.
She came straight to me and shook hands, and at
once I asked, “What do you think of this?”
pointing to (it was before “Jock’s” time) “Ochie.”
Her ladyship picked him up, kissed him, and
told me “ I do love your dogs, all, all; and, Mr.

The Queensland Chief Justice has been
inveighing against the manner in which people
placard fences and buildings with advertisements.
He says that if you want to disgust people with any-
thing make it an eyesore. Look at the Beautiful
Sydney Harbour ! It is now infested by boats on
the sails of which pills are advertised.
The Centennial Magazine must really
look after its names. For instance, Robert Louis
Stevenson’s hero is Mr. Jekyll, and not “ Jeokyll,”
and old Dick Ireland’s second name was Davies
and not Davis—at least we have always read
“ Davies ” in the Law Almanac, which ought to
know; moreover, “Maestrom”is a new word to
us in connection with Poe’s “Tales of Mystery.”
These things we notice at a glance.
The boy-reporter nuisance has broken out

There is speculation in Melbourne as to
Town Clerk Fitzgibbon’s retirement. Some fancy
City Treasurer Thompson for the post, others
fancy a man like Byron Moore. Fitz. himself
thinks the barristerial qualification indispensable,
but one cannot see a Fitzgibbon among any of the
poor barristers, and it is only a very poor one who
would take his screw.
A Melbourne furniture warehouseman now
advertises his goods by inserting in his window a
placard bearing the notice : “ Wanted, 500 boys
and girls to eat lollies and buns,” and on Saturday
evenings between half-past seven and half-past
eight this gluttonous struggle takes place. Juvenile
creation from all parts assembles at the stated
hour and are arranged audience-like in the window,
an employe supplying them with edibles, whilst
the “ devouration ” is witnessed by crowds of
people outside. Last Saturday evening 5000 buns
and a cwt. of lollies were disposed of in an hour.
Captain Jackson Barry, the N.Z. champion
drawer of the long bow, held at one time partner
shares in a mining claim on the Dunstan. The
claim proved a duffer, and his partners, after
sinking a shaft, abandoned it, although Barry had
still great faith in it. Seeing him standing beside
it one day feeling his bumps, a miner called out,
“ What are you standing over that hole for,
scrat hing your head, Barry?” “What am I
standin’ over this ’ole and scratchin’ my ’ed for? ’
said Barry, “ why, becos there’s millions in it,
that’s why.”
The almost-forgotten name of Sir James
M'Culloch, in Victoria, is recalled by an annonce-

he hobnobs with Sir Graham Berry. Best of
friends! Both got the blue ribbon, and by the
same means. Our old friends the People, you
know—with a big P—ha ! ha! Oh, give us a
Duncan Gillies rather than a M‘Culloch or Berry.
What an idol was M'Culloch ! We remember
even a meeting of enthusiastic foreigners in Mel-
bourne in his honor, as the Friend of the People.

Dear Bulletin, —I notice that Mr. John
Tasker, of Wellington, N.Z., writes to you,
stating that the old vessel spoken of by me in
yot r issue of the Ist March is the Endeavour
stranded in Dusky Bay. The ship I mentioned
is not the‘same, for the Bruce did not go so far
south as Dusky Bay, and my mother now tells
me that we had to* pick up passengers at the
Haast, and it was there, whilst the Bruce was
being repaired, we saw the old vessel lying
amongst the rocks in the bed of the river, which
was perfectly dry at the time of ottr visit.
■Furthermore, the ship was hardly 400 tons
burden. As regards the Endeavour, my father
when storm-bound at Dusky Bay in the early
sixties, saw the Endeavour, and brought apiece
of her hull to Victoria, which he presented to the
Melbourne Museum, where, I think, it is to be
seen now, I presume there are settlers on the
Haast now, so, perhaps, should this come under
their notice, they may inform us if the remains of
the ;h!ship are still in existence.—Yours, Anon.
Scholarly old David Blair begins, in the
Centennial, sketches of the Victorian Bar, his first
subjects being Aspinall and Evans. He is going
to revive Ireland, Fellows, Michie, Dawson,
Sewell, and all of them. It is a good subject,
with memories of the old Court, the scene of so
many striking tableaux in Melbourne history.
Blair has an immense opinion of Aspinall’s wit,
but it never looked well on paper. He and Michie
wrote a great deal in the Herald, Dr. Evans was
rather more of a journalist. What a sly old fox
was Dick Ireland, with his spectacles pushed up
on his forehead, and his chuckles to the jury. He
seemed to take them all into his confidence,
making a chorus of them; but Fellows towered
head and shoulders above the Bar, and judges, too.
Stawell, Barry, and Williams were helpless in his
hands. Yet he was eminently fair. Now Higin-
botham never had the cast of mind called legal,
the equipment of a first-class barrister or judge,
that is to say, such an altitude in those lines as he
could reach elsewhere. A far greater man than
Fellows, he was absolutely nowhere beside him in
court.

being sunk with station plant, and the wages are
a pound a week for about ten hours a day and
very rough tucker, with an overseer on the bank
to tell you to “fill it up.” The dockers’sd. an
hour is a fool to it. I was working on the place
lately for a few days, lamb-marking. jThe job
concluded, all hands were summoned to the home-
stead to be paid off, when only one old crawler
accepted his “ quid,” the rest refusing most em-
phatically, although I could have done with a
week or two’s work additional, having humped
“ bluey ’’ for three solid months. We all went to
the travellers’ hut “ to wash out our flannens,” in
the vernacular. Close to the water-hole were
several buckets and “billies” in which rabbit-
poison had been mixed, so one of the men went up
and warned the boss that if anyone were poisoned
we’d make things sultry for him, but they were
not removed. The following morning the new-
chum storekeeper came down and told us to
“ get,” and we gat. Nice treatment for a genuine
working man—as you know very well that only
the real searchers for work come off the rivers at
this time of year. Four Chinamen are employed
permanently at this station as gardener, “ house-
maid and laundress,” and rouseabouts, and they
are treated far better than white men. For in-
stance, when lamb-marking we had to walk from
yard to yard, while the boss drove the slant-eyed
Chows over. This is a poor, hungry district, and
the station spoken of is the hungriest of the lot
and as bad as they make ’em.— Jemmy the
Rambler.
At Stuart Hill, the other day, an agricul-
tural gentleman of poor but Irish parents, suc-
cumbed to rum and other complicated influences
aggravated by typhoid in the district mentioned,
and in due time friends and neighbours were in-
vited in to celebrate the occasion, and get respect-
fully but firmly drunk out of esteem for the dead
man and consideration for the surving branches of
the family. The wake was an immense success,
and nothing in the shape of a policeman occurred
to mar the ardent conviviality or interrupt the
fighting when things began to step high and get in
swing with the con impetnoso flow of soul and
the elegant heap of jigs imparted to the pro-
ceedings by a Fenian cripple armed with a three-
stringed fiddle and a power of crude enthusiasm.
Had somebody of uncommon size and strength,
and power of will, been appointed to keep
sober and overlook the festivities in the in-
terest of deceased, there would have been
no necessity for the description we are writing,
more in sorrow than in anger, but no such office
of trust was created, and the wake was per-
mitted to extend beyond the requirements of
the hour and the necessities of the occasion, in
consequence of which nobody could sober up in
time for the funeral, and the solemn obsequies
we r e conducted in an atmosphere of departed
spirits reminiscent of a superannuated brewery.
The mourners got old Morrissey’s coffin into the
hearse at the appointed hour, however, and the
{nocession started, the sorrowing friends and re-
ations loading themselves into tip-carts and wood-
drays and careering intemperately through the
dust after the late lamented Michael-—who got
away first from scratch and was cutting out the
running, the hearse being half-a-mile ahead most
of the time, whilst the tail of the funeral was
getting interlocked and overturned on the road-
side. Throughout all these tribulations the
blighted mourners maintained a becoming air of
reverential solemnity that could not be anything
but gratifying to deceased, and when the coffin
was lowered into the grave and “ his riverence ”
had said his say, an aged but vigorous female,
under commission, lifted up her harrowing,
scratched-cat, contralto yell, and lamented the
occasion in admirable style, considering that she
was working a dead-horse, the job having already
been paid for in whisky, and the friends and
relations stood about and shed tears over the scene
and commiserated with each other in a way that
was most touching and pathetic. The mourners
were somewhat subdued and indulgent in inward
grief when they returned to the home of the late
lamented, and several had unloaded themselves
and advanced into the house when the rest of the
funeral was startled to hear a discordant series of
shrieks, followed by calls for police assistance and
the benefit of clergy, and simultaneously three
men broke out of the house via windows and the
door and fled into the wood in pursuit of the pro-
tection of various saints and other comforts of
religion, and on the relations going into the
kitchen they discovered the deceased gentleman,
Michael Morrissey, dressed in his shroud and
propped against the mantle-shelf, with his back to
the fire and his old black pipe in his mouth. Then
arose the righteous tempestuousness and expres-
sions of rage already mentioned, and the sons and
heirs of deceased went out with loaded sticks,
demanding vengeance and seeking someone to
kill, but finding him not. Michael Morrissey’s
funeral had to happen all over again. Two de-
praved jokers, under the influence of Milesian
whisky and an inspiration of the Devil, had
removed deceased from his coffin after he had
been screwed down, and whilst the sounds of
revelry were yet heal'd in the farm-house had sub-
stituted bricks and empty bottles and hidden thelale
lamented under a bed, so that all the expense, and
the wailing at the grave, and the prayers of his
reverence had been expended over a heap of dead
marines. Let us hero leave our emotions to the
imagination of the reader.

“ Henry G. lleid, President of the Incor-
porated Institute of British Journalists, inter-
viewed recently, said the prime object of the In-
stitute was “ to raise the character of professional
journalism, and to free it from the curse of
butcher-boys and dcreliet lawyers and parsons.'”
To keep touch with the time, Bishop Goe,
addressing the Dear Boys at St. James’s Grammar
School, Melb., thought he would put in a judicious
allusion to the late champion sculler, but couldn’t
remember his name! Tut—tut “Searle!”
shouted the boys. Let the cobbler stick to his
last.
According to the Argus, the late Duke of
Manchester “ was generally regarded in the
mother country as a good representative of the
best type'Of the British aristocracy.” If Guinea-
pig Montagu was of “ the best type,” what in the

like?
John Dillon, when mixing in British
society, is as distinguished for his Arctic iciness
of demeanour as Parnell himself. This is how
Parnell described a festal affair at which lie and
Dillon were guests: “After Dillon and I h«d

dancing.
New York Sun asks: “Is Talmage a
humbug?” and in six columns proceeds to demon-
strate that he “ profanes holy places by fourth-

lowed “ five glasses of water at the lobby-bar

enlightened thus to be washed out of our legisla-

Dear Bulletin.— Be the Farjeons—l
know “ 8.L.” helped his brother pretty consider-
ably. My authority is the brother himself.
Opportunities, too, were offered by the former to
the latter that would have enabled him to make
the most of his undoubted talent. But ’twas the
old story “ the waywardness of genius,” and so
forth.—A.
The Baroness Burdett-Coutts and her
Bartlett lately celebrated the ninth anniversary
of their wedding. One of the guests, by way of
congratulating the host, reminded him that the
Iron Duke was once a suitor for the hand of the
Baroness. Whereupon another guest, intending
to be complimentary, playfully said—“ But Bart-
lett was not born then.”
Rev. Charles Clarke, just back from
England, is the same admirable clerical comedian.
He would be excellent as some burlesque female
character. He ought never to have been a parson,
but should have introduced himself to us as
Affable Hawk, or any of Charles Matthews’
characters. We might see him in them yet—or
get him to publicly sing “The Hen Convention.” '
Sir Charles Gavan Duffy means to get out
his autobiography, which will be interesting—
especially to Victorians. He is thrice a widower.
Who’d have thought that such a squeaking atomy
bad so much blood in him? “ Mr. Squeaker!”
Why, it Was just like an old woman. But the
stuff in his speeches was good. He would write
out what he had to say, and give absolutely every
word from memory, as did Bishop Moorhouse.
Casey thought he could do it. Ho gave a Sand-
hurst speech beforehand to the Age, which, how-
ever took the precaution of sending up two
reporters. About nine o’clock came down a tele-
gram : “ He hasn't spoken one word of it!”
POLITICAL POINTS
Anagram : “ Federation ” “I feared
not.”
The papers are talking of the N.S.W.
Opposition electing a new leader. A party never
elects a leader—he elects himself.
The Hamburg members of the Reichstag
are all Socialists—three Socialist members. No
wonder the Despot wakes and quakes.
Thirty thousand foreign dock men, &c.,
they say, have been imported to Liverpool and
other English ports. There they stick. Patriotic
masters !
Logic. (I) The “ Speaker ” is the “ voice ”
of the House. (2) The “voice” of tiie South
Australian Legislative Assembly is Bray.
(3) Ergo— the S. A. Assembly is an ass.
The numerical progress of Socialism in
Germany is astounding. In 1867, at Berlin, 07
socialists voted ;in 1887, 774,128; in 1890, the full
poll is not yet known to us, but will probably
reach 1,500,000,
A London paper proposes that a statue be
erected out of the funds of the Royal Society to
“ the memory of the late lamented Richard Pigott,
in consideration of his important services in the
establishment of truth.”
The Charters Towers branch of the Natives’
Association has resolved that Sir John Bray’s
statement at the Federation Conference, that
Australian natives are not Republicans, does not
receive their endorsement.
Another Pulsfordian illustration of the
beauties of British Freetrade ! Bradlaugh, on his
return from India, had to pay duty on thirty-five
presentation silver caskets to an amount con-
siderably in excess of their value.
Reverend Unitarian Walters, is appar-
ently “on the fence” as to George’s doctrines.
Now, we call upon him as one of the few students
of modern literature in Sydney’s pulpits to get
down on the Land-nationalisation-ram-Compensa-
tion side of the panel.
Carlyle wrote about the German Emperor
and his Working Men’s Congress in the “French
Revolution.” Turn up that passage where ho
refers to the farmer asking his pigs with what
sauce he shall cook them. Says the pig : “We
don’t want to be eaten.”
The Christchurch (N.Z.) Telegraph re-
cently contained an article in which it was stated
that W. W. Lyght, visiting that city as the
alleged representative of the American Knights of
Labour, had shown no proof that ho was the
accredited agent of that body.
Henry George has been twitting David
Syme, of the Age, with going back on his Land-
nationalisation doctrines of a dozen years ago. It
is as though the American philosoper were to start
finding faults in the orginal Ananias, so Mel-
bourne passes the incident by with a casual snort.
In the Times’ report of W. H. Smith’s
resolution as to the Parnell letters, the word
“forged,” used by Old Morality, was carefully
left out. The journal has never used that word
in connection with the Pigott effusions. The
Australian daily press lias thus high, offensively
high, example for its frequent little suppressions
of awkward facts.
The Bulletin would respectfully suggest
to the Single-tax League that they should elect
Mrs. Garland president, in place of her hubby.
Both have read “Progress and Poverty,” but she
understands it. At all events, she knows enough
about its doctrine not to give the “cause” away
the first time she is asked a leading question.
Which can’t be said for Garland, M.P.
Salomons says it is the landless who are
Single-taxers. Now, as a statement of a general
law, the remark might be as accurate as we can
expect that of a lawyer to be, but in particular in-
stances it is wrong. Take Jack Haynes, for example.
He’s a Single-taxer; at least, he says he is. And
we know he has an estate. But, jesting apart, the
landless are in the vast majority, and Salomons’
statement is an argument against, instead of, for
private property in land.
Mr. Caine, the Unionist Whip, has written:
“I cannot find language to express my horror of
the foul conspiracy to which Mr. Parnell has been
subjected, or ray opinion of the conduct of the
Times in lending itself to these infamous libels on
the flimsy evidence furnished to them of their
supposed genuineness. Mr. Parnell must be held
to have come through the inquiry practically un-
scathed.” Coming from the enemy, this letter
ought to be jam for the Uncrowned King.
It is no secret that Henry George has been
grievously disappointed to find the N.S. Wales
Single-tax party what it is—numerically, mentally
and financially. He had conceived a very different
idea of its strength, partly from Garland’s, M.P.,
skiting when on his recent “tour” in the States,
and partly from an official letter of Secretary
Meggy’s, published in the New York Standard,
in which it was state ; d that “the Single-taxers
bear the balance of political power in the colony !”
On that historical occasion when Purves
stood up and wept before the A.N.A. delegates he
stated that it “had been the dream of his life to
become a leader of men ” and that his dream had
been realised in his connection with the little
mutual admiration crowd of Natives. Purves is
easily satisfied. A cynical stranger, attending an
A.N.A. Conference and studying the quality of
the jabber thrown off thereat, would conclude that
the inflated Q.C. was not so much a leader of men,
as boss over a lot of boys.
Henry George, at Melbourne, in one of his
anti-prqtectionist flings, wanted to know how
Protection would benefit the tram-conductors.
We’ll tell him. But for the existence of factories
in Melbourne the unemployed th e re would increase
to a twenty-fold their present numbers, and the
applicants for train vacancies would assuredly
multiply in the same ratio. With ten or twenty
men to pick from where there are now one or two,
would present rate of wages in the train service be
maintained? Not much, Mr. George. Just ask
Sprigg.
“ If the Christian religion is sound, then
Freetrade must eventually prevail. I believe in
the justice, freedom, and truth established by the
common Christian religion, and I feel that it is
impossible for Protection to prevail.” Thus doth
Pope Parkes excommunicate the wicked and un-
regenerate of a world run on the principle of
“Fat or be Eaten.” Thus doth he cast into
outer darkness where there is weeping and gnash-
ing of teeth those who having been hit on the
point of the jaw refuse to turn the other cheek to
Calico-Jemmy, the smiter.
Duncan Gillies has his lucid intervals and
redeeming points. A couple of Victorian senators,
one of whom keeps a little pub., waited upon
Duncan to ask him what he could do in the
matter of carrying Chows, at a reduced rate, to
the Sandhurst Fair. The fat little Premier re-
plied that he would do nothing at all, after which
the whisky man and his pals retired in great con-
fusion. 'I his is the first time that any Australian
Government has been asked by alleged white men
to grant special concessions to the slant-eyed
leper—except in the way of enabling him to leave
the country —and we trust it won’t occur again.
The report that a St. Petersburg “social-
ist ” has committed suicide, after confessing that
he was chosen by lot to blow up the Czar, is a lie
on the face of it. In the first place, no socialist
enters into plots for assassination —not even of the
Czar. In the next place, no man would kill him-
self rather than kill the Czar, not under any cir-
cumstances. Moreover, it is beginning to be
understood that most of these Nihilist—not
Socialist —plots are invented by the Russian police
to the order of his Most Sacred Majesty. It is
necessary to find constant excuses for his chronic
condition of funk. The very latest cablegram
about Mr. Immensikoff Romanoff is that it is
untrue he has been poisoned as alleged—he is
“only suffering from fainting-fits.”
Colonel Stoffel's recently-published pair
phlet has raised once more the question whet he-
Germany did wisely in depriving France of Alsace
and Lorraine, and whether, had the conquerors
been content to receive a larger indemnity in
money, while leaving French territory intact,
peace and goodwill between the two nations might
not have been possible in lieu of deadly animosity,
which may at any moment take the form of war.
Prince Bismarck’s organ, the North German
Gazette, replies that in the course of three cen-
turies France attacked Germany no less than 20
times, and that it would be ridiculous to trust to
French forbearance when it was so much more
simple to take up a commanding military position
and to extend the German frontier as far as the
Vosges. It is quite a mistake to suppose that the
military party in Germany was alone in favour of
feizing Alsace and Lorraine—that is to say, the
fortresses of Strasburg and Metz. Prince Bis-
marck thought, equally with Count Moltke, that
the French, who had not forgiven the Prussians
for the victory of Sadowa, which in no way con-
cerned the interests of France, would never pardon
the defeat of Sedan, and that whatever the con-
ditions of peace might be, they would, in five, ten,
twenty years, as soon as they found themselves
strong enough, recommence the war.

A clerk in defendant’s employ deposed that he saw the
horse dead at the sales stables. He was not a bad horse—for
a dead horse. Did not know that the horse had committed
suicide to avoid falling into the hands of Shy lock. Did not know
whether time-payment men ever worked dead horses.
His Honor said that he need not tell the jury that it
was their duty, as it was also his to decide the ease as
far as thev could according to the law and the facts- they

appeared that the plaintiff in the case, being in want of a
small sum of money, went to this loan-company, of which the defend
was a part proprietor and manager From this company he obtained a
!mtfin of £7 10s ,of ‘which only £6 7s. 6d. was actually paid to him. For somo

defendant and another IDs., which was disputed. They had heard the plaintiff's
evidence on the point, and possibly they believed it, Plaintiff agreed to repay
£:> 10s in instalments of Gs. per week and ho executed a bill of sale, which ad-
fondant said plaintiff understood Well, if lie did understand it, he was an abler
man than most of the lawyers in the court, because lie (his Honor) personally had
very great difficulty in understanding some of the clauses, and was not at all clear
that lie understood them now. Indeed, he had reserved the consideration of one of
the clauses for the Full Court. However, this document was drawn up as a drag-
net, dragging, he feared, everything into it; at any rate it was certainly largo
enough to do so. There was one clause in the deed which provided that in case the
mortgagor should make any default in payment, or if he should not produce to tho
mortgagee or his agent on Monday in every week the receipt for the rent of lus
premises, defendant could step in. It was ad-
mitted that plaintiff did not produce these re-
ceipts, and, indeed, he admitted that he had not
paid the rent for three or four weeks There-
fore, according to the terms of this document, he
was in default, and being in default the defendant
had the right to seize the goods He legally had
the right to do so even if the plaintiff had paid
everything except Gs More than that, if de-
fendant. had found out when the plaintiff had
corn's to pay his last instalment of 65., although
he might have paid £9 45., that he was but one

down upon this man’s house, taken every stick of
furniture out of it, removed the wearing apparel
of plaintiff and his wife, all the little articles of

What trouble the clergy have in keeping
the toes of all the Australian judges up to the
line ! Here’s Boucaut, in ■' delaide, kicking over
the straps. Chief-Justice Hanson there wrote a
hook of Strauss, mixed with Renan. As for Vic-
toria—why, Orthodoxy has scarce a judge. Chief
Justice Higinhotham is—well, all that is shocking.
Then there is Judge Williams—worse, if possible.
Hodges, to be sure, has a little of the Stawell tar-
brush ; Webb is a Wesleyan, but visible in the
dress-circle when a good play is on; Holroyd is
never discerned in any Ebenezer work; A’Beckett
is a negation; Hood never takes the chair at a
missionary meeting. Oh, for another Judge
Fellows, who built the Queenscliff Church ! But,
after all, what sort of an oyster-and-porter church-
man was he ? Then there was Wilberforce
Stephen, Chancellor of the Church of England—he
sold it dead as prime promoter of the godless
Education Act. And Sir Redmond Barry—dear,
old, gay Sir Redmond ! Why, he was a Sir George
Bowen.
N.S. Wales is somewhat better off. Darley,
C.J., is starchy and orthodox; Foster, J., is abso-
lutely pious; Stephen, Innes and Manning are all
pretty good churchmen ; Windeyer alone has a
strongly liberal kink, and what a perfect daisy he
is, taken all round ! Chief Justice Martin had no
religious prejudices of any kind. Nor is there
much piety in Chief Justice Lilloy. No really
pious man could write such wicked letters to
“ dear Stirling.”

The fire-bell was put down in Melbourne
as a nuisance, but now they have the harsh c'angour
of St. Raul’s Cathedral bells in the midst of the
city. This hideous peal is warranted to kill any
sick person within a half-mile radius. Why should
the tire-bell be denied a license accorded to the
hell-fire-bell ?
An idea strikes us : Let the clergy lay on
the telephone to their customers’ houses and shout
“ Hello ! ” when it’s time to go to church.

Some time back a Sydney citizen, one
Campbell, committed an act that should, in the
good old times, have brought him much glory,
but which through the degeneracy of modern
ideas has procured for his memory nothing
but an infinity of curses. He left a peal
of bells to St. Phillip’s Church with an un-
derstanding that they were to be rung so
many times every week. The good clergyman
who runs the show, not having the sense to let
such a barbarous injunction fall into abeyance, has
solemnly carried it out. On Good Friday they
were jangled at all hours, Sunday the same, and
even on Monday the residents around Church
Hill were tormented by these awful bells
making the morning air hideous. Surely
this parsonic fiend should be brought under
some sort of law. Let him set the following verses
to the horror of his bells :
Mr. Campbell! Mr. Campbell ! when you twang
your harp and sing,
Do you think what mortals utter when those bells
of yours they ring ?
When the parson (Devil take him !) has them
jangled, pealed, and slammed.
Mr. Campbell! Mr. Campbell ! people say may
you be d d.
Mr. Campbell! Mr. Campbell ! where you’re
snuffling saintly airs
Do they call with bell discordant for the just to
to come to prayers ?
Is the holy calm of Heaven thus bedeafened out
of tune
Till the flashing jasper pavement with bad words
is all bestrewn ?
Mr. Campbell! Mr. Campbell! in your own time
you were wise,
For you had them hung and swung there after
you’d left for the skies.
Win our gratitude then for us, even though its
rather late;
Get the Lord to send a message that he wants
that parson straight.

A Sydney cheap draper says that although
he has hundreds of pounds’ worth of goods stolen
from his shop in Oxford street he never prosecutes.
Women are the chief offenders, and their favourite
trick is to put their babies down and lift some
article of drapery when taking up the little
beauty. The Bulletin has at last ascertained
what babies are good for. Innocence is a first-
class thing to steal with.

Two well-to-do Melbourne women have
been arrested for kleptomania—in company—at
least, we suppose it will be called kleptomania, but
the barrister will be puzzled. “Look here, you
know, two kleptomaniacs together ; it stems hope-
less.” One of the women is a widow, owning a
terrace of houses ; the other is the wife of a pros-
perous butcher. They are alleged to have robbed
drapers’ shops.

The Bulletin notices that the will of a
Sydney lady, who died some considerable time
ago, worth one, two, or three or more millions,
does not yet appear to have been proved. If it
has not yet been put through the Court, the sooner
that operation is performed the better. The pro-
bate duty on, say. two millions, at five percent.,
would be £150,000, and the annual interest on
£150,000, at 4 per cent., would be £OOOO.

Conflicting stories as ti the condition of
the widow of the late Lord “Gumboil” Cairns are
published in the London papers. Some say that
the aforesaid condition is “interesting,” while
others deny that there is any possibility of an
heir-apparent, therefore Mr. Herbert Cairns may
assume the title whenever he choose. If Herbert
really has cause to bo afraid of an interloping
little stranger, we recommend him to hedge a bit.
The natural odds are only slightly in favour of a
boy, so if lie likes to offer £15,000 to £lO,OOO
against his chance of succession, no doubt some of
the old nobility will book it. One of our Austra-
lian governors, for instance, is fond of a sporting
wager. £lO,OOO would partially console Herbert
for the birth of his nephew, and if the babe fell an
early victim to convulsions, “ nunky ” would come
in for the title before he had “ blewed” the wager.
What a splendid double to bring off !

A European lady, from China, has brought
over to Melbourne from China her Celestial nurse,
who carries the baby after her along the Collins-
street Block. The nurse is a Chinese woman
about 40 years old, in full Celestial costume, with
trousers, but no hat, having her hair done up in
picturesque fashion with silver hairpins in an
Italian-looking style. Which reminds us that a
fine-looking South Sea Island woman is staying at
a Sydney coffee-palace, where she walks about in a
print frock, out A to Grecque, on bare feet, with an
ease and dignified innocence that Alls the corseted
waitresses with envy and melts the breasts of the
susceptible pressmen who dine there and pick
their teeth outside the Athenaeum.
A very smart thing has been done up
South. A lot of the bhoys determined to start
a paper and sent round a canvasser to get
shares subscribed. This canvasser induced all the
subscribers to entrust him with their proxies for
the election of directors. The consequence is
that he appointed himself to something snug and
constructed a board of directors whose names
read like a fist of police-arrests at Ballyhooley fair.

A certain Kb. W. Cabinet Munster is the
source of much amusement to the officials in his
Department. His decisions, if nothing else, are
novel and original. Nothing is too irrelevant to
receive his “ approval ” or “concurrence.” One
recommendation for giving a man a billet is that
it has been “promised.” The natural death of
one official and the suicide of another both get his
“approval.” If a list of applicants for employ-
ment is sent to him he marks it “ approved.” He
concurs in even an adverse newspaper criticism of
himself. He gloats over the newspaper reports of
his own speeches, and not only marks them “ ap-
proved,” but endorses them as “an intelligent
account of the case.” The most trivial incident
is recorded in the daily press, so desirous is he of
appearing in print. He has a high notion of what
is “proper and becoming to a Minister of the
Crown.” So, in imitation of Gov. Carington, it
is supposed, lie makes the messengers fly before
him to clear the way at his entrances and his exits.
If he has to ascend the G.P.O. tower with Lord
Mullett or the Duke of Cockatoo, the tower is
closed to the public, and all the messengers, &0.,
in Sunday attire have to
be in readiness to receive
them.

If you want to shock the Rev. Garnsey
or some other high-toned and incensed and gilded
Sydney Ritualist, ask him if he’s aware that a
former president of the English Union is in Ber-
rima prison. And, then, when he has writhed
sufficiently, soothe him gently with the informa-
tion that it is only as clerk and schoolmaster, and
not as a graduated sinner, that the sainted
functionary “does ” Berrima.
* * # .
The late Dr. Littledale, the “scholar” of
the Ritualists, was the best composer in all Eng-
land of those fearful and wondrous things called
acrostics. He was L'AIM of the World. There
isn’t much, difference, after all, between puzzles
and problems in ecclesiastical scholarship. While
exalted prelates like Moran and Camidge have
nothing better to do than to propound conun-
drums to one another we’ll wager that no one can
answer this riddle: What is the present use of the
Church ?

A Melbourne religious newspaper whines
over the poor clergy who only get £3OO a year,
and asks for donations of books for Jhem, be-
cause they cannot afford them. We once heard a
clergyman, in the Presbyterian Assembly, call
£5OO a year “miserable !” It was the Rev. Dods,
Dr. Strong’s coadjutor, now gone home to some-
thing more substantial. Rev. Quick, Wesleyan
minister, wrote in the Melbourne Daily Tele-
graph some time ago that a clergyman could not
live properly on £3OO a year. The meek and lowly
one couldn’t keep his servants, drawing-room, and
the indispensable buggy, we suppose.

The Anglican Bishop of Melbourne has
been meekly suggesting to local teetotallers that,
although abstainers are the soul of the good cause,
“ moderate drinkers ” are also a valuable moral
check on the spread of jim-jams. Brother Eield
]’ lowers Goe is a moderate drinker, you will ob-
serve. He lowers his two glasses of beer at dinner
with a pious and unworldly gurgle that is soothing
to the ear in wai’m weather, and he can supple-
ment the tanglefoot by just one glass-—“ a sma-all
glass-s, if you please ” —of wine, on special oc-
casions. The Bishop doesn’t smoke, however,
because he has never felt the want of it, do you
know. A parson with Gee’s private means, and
neither chick nor child to worry him, has no parti-
cular call to seek nepenthe in a pipe of ruby twist,
perhaps. But a clergyman friend of Goe’s, who
had great trouble in getting to sleep at nights,
was advised to try one cigar before retiring to his
bedroom, and since then the reverend gentleman
sleeps, Oh !so soundly. A doosid pretty story,
don’t you think ?

A sandy-haired man with freckles poured
Ins woes into the sympathising ear of a portly and
well-groomed parson, on board a Sydney tram
from a fashionable suburb. The freckled man
carried in his hand an advertisement for a servant,
and on the misguided notions of duty held by the
last occupant of the post he descanted with vigour:
—“Yes, sir, she was only in the house three days.
During that time she made a beefsteak-pie a dog
would bark at, burnt the fronts out of two of my
shirts, trimmed her boot-heels with my best hollow-
ground razor, and stayed out all night at a dancing-
house to which she went in a complete suit of my
wife s clothes. By the way, I expect you know
her, as lam told she sings in your choir?” “Oh !
then I suppose it is Miss ——you are speaking of.
I had a note from her this morning, in which she
asks me for consolation, having been compelled to
leave a situation in which she was not appreciated.
I am now on my way to perform that pastoral
duty. Good morning, my dear sir. Good morn-
ing.”

Lilliput, on current maps, exists a few miles away

daily. But whether the place owes its name to
the man or the man takes his from the place is
doubtful. Anyhow, the fact remains that Lilliput
is in Victoria, and that Gulliver lives there.

Victoria, has just died in England, aged 83. The
old fellow was a doctor, but had to manufacture
ginger-beer for a living, because the high tide of

through the streets, pushing a truck. He had a
miserly reputation, but he was President of the

at was that he did good by stealth. He lived on
the Hawthorne Hill, bought and cut up by old

he was talking to, and furthermore informed him
that any compartment graced by a gentleman,
especially a Minister of the Crown accompanied
by ladies, was transformed from a baccy-shop to a
boudoir—or words to that effect. ' Then he in-
vited the now abashed, as he thought, smoker
either to put his pipe out or himself. The oloud-
compeller did neither, and when the senator
endeavoured to thrust him forth, the depraved
rascal arose and smote him with great slaughter.

A correspondent writes ;
I have not seen the London World’s “Celebrities at
Home” article with B. L. Farjeon as its subject, and 1
don’t therefore know whether any reference is made to
the circumstance that the novelist is himself the hero of
as pretty a bit of romance as everhe created. Years ago,
when a hard-working pressman in N.Z., he was shown a
portrait of Joe (“ Rip Van Winkle ”) Jefferson’s daughter.
Then and there, fascinated by the charm of the face, he
tell in love with, and vowed to marry the original, if she
were “ free and available.” Nothing appeared more un-
likely at the time than that he would ever realise his vow.

Some Canadian Mormons have raised the
legal point that there is not one English law

The result will, no doubt, be looked for with some
degree of anxiety by prominent Sydney society
men who at present are compelled, in deference
to the social proprieties, to distribute their harems
under several roof-trees. It would be so much

need not mind the trifling preliminary expense of

quoted Carlyle* saying that “all mankind were
divided into three classes —workers, beggars, and
robbers.” Hereupon some one in the audienct
called out: “And what class do you belong to?”
“ The robbers,” replied Foxall, “and I want you
to deprive me of the opportunity of robbing. ”
THE FEDERATION OAK.
[n the Gardens of the Parliament at Melbourne
can be seen,
By anyone who seeks it out, a sapling fresh and
green;
And may it ne’er be stricken by a vandal axe-
man’s stroke,
But live to be a landmark great—a Federation
Oak.
’Twas planted by Sir ’Enry on a pleasant autumn
day,
A little crowd of windbags gathered round and
blew “ Hooray 1”
When ’Enry with a pickaxe gave the ground a
feeble poke,
Where a place was made already for the Federa-
tion Oak.
He used to think Australia was simply New
South Wales;
To express his scorn for Melbourne our vocabulary
fails.
But now he goes there often (on the spree, the
giddy bloke !)
And, to show he loves his neighbours, plants a
Federation Oak.
If his patriotic ardour gets a little time to cool,
He slates about the Murray and begins to play
the fool;
So no man pays attention to the gushing words he
spoke
At the Conference whose fruits will be the acorns
of the oak.
Ah! tend that sapling carefully, x>rotect it from the
boy
E’er ready with his penknife Nature’s wonders to
destroy ;
Though the talking-match in Melbourne was but
’Enry’s little joke,
In Austral's heart is striking deep the Federation
Oak.
It’s trunk shall be colossal and its branches high
shall wave
When the present generation lies forgotten in the
grave ;
The peaceful rain of wisdom round the sapling’s
roots shall soak,
Till we drink, “Our Free Republic!” ’neath the
Federation Oak.
The tree Sir ’Enry planted in its boyhood fresh
and green—
When the “leading men’s” religion was the
worship of the Queen,
And the drowsy country listened to their lying,
“ loyal ” croak—
May it grow to be respected as the Federation
Oak !

“GRIP.”
Now tins influenza scare
Is a stroke of fortune rare
For a lot of men who ne’er,
Get the Grip;
All the “ symptoms ” they display.
And in bed are thought to stay,
But they tripit down the bay
On a ship.
That’s a tip
For the clerks who stop away
With the Grip.
Its a blessed thing to sneeze
Every boy at school agrees,
Then at once he murmurs “ Please,
I’ye the Grip;
I can feel it in the head,
Both my legs are lumps of lead.
And my eyes are getting red—
May I skip ?”
That’s the tip,
For on dainties they are fed
With the Grip.
The husband of a wife
Who’s the worry of his life
Gets a little rest from strife
Through the Grip ;
He talks about the scare
Till she wants a change of air,
Then he goes upon the “ tear ”
Gay old rip!
That’s a tip.
Husbands, offer up a prayer
For the Grip.
It behoves us to acquaint
Parties down with this complaint
That the whisky-bottle ain’t
G od for Grip ;
If you do not wish to die,
On your backs you ought to lie
Till you get about as “ dry ”
As a chip,
That’s the tip—
Oh ! it makes the boozers sigh,
Does the Grip.
Some maidens fear to know
If moustaches tickle so.
When their nicest Sunday beau
Has the Grip;
But girls, who doubtful are,
Take our word that a cigar
Will destroy bacteria-r
On the lip.
That’s the tip
Let ’em smoke like dear papa,
With the Grip.
Yet nought a spooney lad
Cares if Popsy’s got it bad—
It is catching, too, begad !
Is the Grip;
No fellow stops to think
When the nectar’s there to drink.
He goes, as quick as wink,
For a sip.
Take our tip—
When her skin is white and pink
’Tis unnatural to shrink
From the Gri p.


The special interest that we have always
taken in commercial undertakings which
have for their chief object the promotion of
the well-being of the working man in Aus-
tralia, must be our excuse to-day for bring-
ing under the notice of our readers the
Citizens’ Life Assurance Co., Limited, of
Sydney, whose annual report has just been
issued, disclosing results which supply
material for the consideration of every
thoughtful man.
Life Assurance is one of those questions
which most people reflect upon, and which
wise men act upon in these days. It was not
always thus, but times have changed. As the
duration of human life is more or less un-
certain, men deem it prudent to make pro-

vision against the unforeseen. A rich man
need not be so anxious about these things,
but a man who is not rich, whose family is
dependant upon his weekly or monthly
salary, has no other means open to provide
for them.
Never in the history of Life Assurance
were men so wide awake to its advantages as
at the present time. The exceedingly rapid
growth of the leading offices in recent years
is sufficient proof that educated men are
beginning to find it one of the best invest,
ments. It has, in this sense, a twofold
advantage. In the first place, Life Assur-
ance, when effected in a first-class office,
receives a high rate of interest for the
money invested, which is not always the case
Dr. J. J. POWER,
DIRECTOR.
in commercial investments —this is the busi-
ness point of view. Then again in the higher
and more rational sense, Life Assurance
makes provision for those dependant upon
the assurers. The tenure of life, even in the
healthiest, is so uncertain that it is morally
incumbent upon a man not rich to make
some provision for his family by the aid of
Life Assurance. It is a foolish notion to
think that there is no use assuring unless
you assure for a good “round sum,” but a
“ little store ’ laid by is better than no pro-
vision at all.
We continually hear a great deal about the
want of thrift in the working classes, but the
results achieved by the Citizens’ Life Assur-
ance Company make it clear beyond ques-
tion that the “masses’ are making great
strides in the direction of providing for the
future, and in no class of the community is
this “making provision forthefut uro” of more
importance than to the “ hewers of wood
and drawers of water,” who are nevertheless
the backbone and sinew of the country. The
great middle or industrial class has, until late
years, been practically debarred from avail-
ing themselves of
the benefits of Life
Assurance in the
Australian Colonies
in consequence of
the Assurance Com-
panies charging
their premiums
yearly, half-yearly,
or quarterly, but
whatever 1 excuse
there may have been
in the past, there
is not now a single
reason why every
man, woman, and
child should not
avitil themselves
of the inducements
held out by Life
Assurance Offices.
The Citizens’ de-
vote their special
attention to that
system of Life
Assurance known as
the “Industrial,”

tables of rates calculated for the weekly
payment of premiums, and issue policies for
sums ranging from £lO upwards. Policies
on the lives of children are issued from date
of birth. Payments can be made from Id. a
week upwards, and the sum assured may be
payable on
death or oil
attaining a giv en
age. Premiums
can be paid
weekly, fort-
nightly or
monthly to suit
the Convenience
of the policy-
holders, and the
agents of the
Company call
periodically at
the houses of
the assured for
the payment of
sums due.
The number
of new policies
issued during
1889 was 67,325,
which far and
atvay excels
anything ever
done in Indus-
trial Life Assur-
ance in this
country before.
The average

weekly premiums on the policies in force
on the books of this Company amounts to a
little over 4d. per week, and the amount
of labour involved in the collection of over
£*50,000 must be
enormous, but,
nevertheless, it does
not in any way les-
sen the perfection
of the system of
book-keeping
adopted. Every
proposal received
and every collec-
tion made during
every week in the
year is subjected to
checks at the Com-
pany’s head office,
and it would not
be possible, so wo
understand, for
even an error of a
Id. to occur in
the accounts of any
of the Company’s
representatives in
the most remote
portion of the
colonies without its
being discovered.

cial transaction if any man were to offer to
pay any debt owing by such a small in-
stalment as 4d. per week, the creditor,
sooner than bo put to the trouble of
sending round to have that collected, would
almost prefer to make his debtor a present
of the amount,. It is a sum of not sufficient
magnitude U* attain to the importance of
of an investment, but, if we may so use
the term, it is a sum of money won from the
follies of the people and invested for
them. Small as is that sum let us make
a summary of the labour involved before the
contract is entered
into. The canvasser
of the Company,
often in wet and
slush, travels
throughout the day
seeking everyone
whom he thinks will
probably assure in
his office, and the
successfulcanvasser
lias to bring to
bear, in the trans-
action of his work,
an amount of deter-
mination which is
only characteristic
of a brave soldier
in a good cause.
He has, in addition,
by reason of the
difficulties and pre-
judice which exist
in the minds of
many persons, to
use a skill which
would adorn the
greatest lawyer on
the bench. Then, before the proposal is
considered by the office, friends have to
be referred to, because the character
and habits of the person must be of that
order and steadiness which would commend
the proposal to the Directors, or else it would
not be enter-
tained in its
initial stage..
The Superin-
tendent or In-
spector has then
to report on
the risk, and
if it is of suffi-
cient in agn i-
tude,the Doctor
must make an
examination.
The collector has
then to call week
after week for
this small sum of
money (which,
if not called for,
would probably
be spent in a
manner bring-
ing no return
to the person
spending it) a
receipt has to
be given, the
money has to
be brought to
the office of the
Company to he
recorded in the office books—which form
that complex ' and magnificent system uf
book-keeping already referred to, ' Then
the policy-holders, once entered on the books
of the Company,
are at, Jibei’ty to
travel from one
end of the colonies
to another without
any extra charge.
This is unquestion-
ably one of the
benefits to be de-
rived from effect-
ing an assurance
with a Company,
whoso system has
been extended
right around our
island continent.
The Citizens’ has
branches in all the
colonies, and
agencies in every
town and hamlet.
In the Northern
colony, Queens-
land, the business
is under the
management of Mr.
Joseph Butler; in
Victoria, under
Mr. W. Nimmo Dewar ; in South Australia,
under Mr. Columbus Rochfort; and inWestern
Australia, where an agency has been
some considerable time, arrangements have
been completed for the establishment of a
fully equipped branch, and it is pleasing to
note that the Company has not boon in the
slightest degree deterred in their oilward
march by the recently passed West Australian
Act, requiring a deposit, with the Colonial
Treasurer there, of £lO,OOO, and it was
announced at the annual meeting that that
deposit will be promptly made. We ob-
serve that similar deposits have been made
in those colonies whose enactments require
such security, and the Managing Director, in
his annual speech, spoke strongly and em-
phatically in favour of the Government of the
Mother Colony, New South W r ales, rising
equal to the occasion and protecting one of
the most sacred interests of the public, by
legislating on Life Assurance according to
modem ideas, and requiring a substantial de-
posit from any Company coming here to
transact business.
JOHN SEE, Esq., M.P.,
DIRECTOR.
(Late Postmaster General.)
The Citizens’ Life Assurance Company
has indeed earned for itself a reputation
which stands high in the estimation of the
Australian public for the prompt payment of
claims. Out of the large number of claims
paid, the Company has never yet gone to law-
over a single claim, but, on the contrary,,
has always made it a special feature to pay-
all claims immediately after receipt of thu
necessary proofs, without putting claim-
ants to any expense whatever beyond a fee
of 2s. paid to the Registrar of deaths for the
necessary certiticate. The Directors have in
consequence received numerous letters oi
thanks both through the press and privately
from persons who have been entitled to and'
have received prompt payment of claims. A

list containing copies of some of the letters
received and the names of hundreds of
claimants may be had at any of the Com-
pany’s branch offices, or at the head office.
It may not be out of place here to mention
one or two illustrations of this commendable
promptitude. Our readers will remember
the terrible mining accident which occurred
recently at the A. A. Company’s mines, New-
castle. As a large number of the miners in
the Newcastle district are policy-holders in
the Citizens’, the Directors immediately die
patched one of their officers from the head
office to the scene of disaster, armed with fuh
authority to settle all claims immediately at
they arose. A claim under Policy No.
9319 on the fife of one of the unfortunate
miners, Hodson, was paid to his widow
long before the body was actually ic-
covered. In the recent Hoods in Queens-
land, at Ipswich, Henry Robertson was

noon of the same day. His representatives
were paid the full sum assured. Another case
in Queensland —a father jumped down a well
to rescue his child and was himself drowned,
and although his policy had been very re-
cently issued the amount assured was paid in
full. Another policy-holder named Carter,
while bathing in Sydney harbour, was attacked
and devoured by a shark. The claim for the
full amount was paid immediately. In Gee-
long, Victoria, a Mrs. Caton was accidentally
poisoned. The poison was in the house, and
during the night, mistaking it for another
fluid, she drank it, and thus a claim arose,

and the husband, who was in poor circum-
stances, wrote gratefully to the office
acknowledging their promptitude and
stated that he was quite unaware that any-
thing was due him. If necessary similar
instances could be given in South Australia,
and even in Western Australia, where, in
the Pearl Fishery Disaster a year ago, the
Company’s policy-holders were represented,
one of the unfortunate men lost being
assured.
We cannot do better than give two or
three illustrations of the testimonials re-
ceived, which were in all cases addressed to
the Directors :
Mr. COLUMBUS ROOTTFORT,

79 Elizabeth-street,
W atcrloo,
Sydney,
Gentlemen,—
Allow me to tender my thanks for the manner
in which claim on policy 55,355 on the life of my
husband, Archibald Craig, was settled. He was
only assured on the sth November, and on Wed-
nesday, during the great thunderstorm, when
standing at the door, was struck by lightning, and
lingered in great agony until Friday, when he
succumbed. The total premium paid on the policy
was Is. 9d., and the full sum assured was paid
over at once, without being put to any trouble.
Little did I think that the policy would be a claim
so soon, but this only shows how people should be
prepared to take advantage of the great blessings
of an Industrial Life Policy. I will always do my
best to forward the interests of your Company.
Yours, most respectfully,
Janet Crato.

Gentlemen, —
In acknowledging receipt of cheque value

the death of my late husband, Francis .I. Negas,
who was assured in your company, I DESIRE TO
EXPRESS MY SINCERE THANKS FOR
THE PROMPT PAY.’ I ENT THEREOF. I
can assure you that I will use my utmost endea-
vours to bring your Company, which, has proved
an inestimable boon to myself and hundreds of
others, before my friends and acquaintances.
Yours, Ac.,
JANE NEGUS.’
28a Iffla-street,
South Melbourne.
Gentlemen,—
I gratefully thank you for the prompt settle-
ment of claim on the policy of my late husband’s
life, who died to-day at noon. Although notice
of the death was only received at the Company’s
office at 8 o’clock this evening (Saturday), after
you had been informed of the extreme urgency of
my case, you generously sent one of your officials
to pay the full amount of the policy within the
hour. You are at liberty to make any use of this
letter you think, and I have no hesitation in say-
ing that the Citizens’ Life Assurance Company
has been to me a genuine friend in the hour of
need.
Yours very truly,
FANNY TOWN END.

Gentlemen, —
I beg to thank you for the very prompt
manner in which my claim has been paid on
Policy 119,189 for £24 The policy was
only issued three weeks ago by your com-
pany on the life
of my late bus
band, Simeon
Hurst, who lost
his life on 28th
January through
jumping in the
well to save our
only child from
drowning. In
returning thanks,
I may state that
the great benefits
and protection to
be derived through
being the helder
of one of the Citi-
zens’ Life Assur-
ance Company’s
policies cannot be
too widely known.
My late husband
was only earning
small wages, and
had it not been
for the amount
of this policy, for
which he only
paid a weekly pre-

should now have
hern left penniless.
I again heartily
thank your direc-
tors and promise
you that I shall

do all I can to make known to my friends and
neighbours the great benefit a policy in the
Citizens’ is to persons in my position.
I beg to remain,
Yours sincerely,
HANNAH SYKES HURST.
P.S. —You may make use of this letter in any
way you choose.

Gentlemen, —
I beg to offer ray sincere THANKS to the
CITIZENS’ LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY
for the prompt payment of the claim under Policy
No. 500,905 on the life of my husband, W. Henry
Davey, lately deceased.
Immediately on producing the necessary papers
a cheque for amount of claim was handed to me.
The premium being only fid. per week, and the
Company’s collector calling so regularly, I had
little difficulty in keeping up the payments, and I
will lose no opportunity of recommending the
Citizens’ Life Insurance Company to my friends
and acquaintances.

In every phase of society it will th is be
seen that death is constantly occurring, and
in these humble homes nothing could be
more beneficial than a policy taken out in an
office such as this.
The Railway Commissioners of this colony
are now insisting on every official in the
employ of the Department assuring his life,
and they take upon themselves the duty of
naming the offices in which employes may
take out policies. It will be seen from the
following letter that the Citizens' Assurance
Company has been approved of as one of the
Companies for the assurance of railway em-
ployes :
Government Railways of N.S. Wales,
Secretary’s Office, Sydney,
February 26, 1890.
Sir, —In reply to your letter of February 24, I
have the honor to inform you that the Railway
Commissioners have approved of your Society as
one with which employes may insure their lives.
I have the honour to be, sir,
Your obedient servant,
H. M‘Lachlan,

* # *
Though chiefly devoting their energies to-
wards the promotion of their Industrial De-
partment, the Citizens’ also transact Ordinary
Life Assurance, and have their Ordinary De-
partment divided into two sections, General
arid Temperance. In the Temperance
section, total abstainers are grouped together,
and any benefit accruing to them from their
total abstinence will be secured to them in
the shape of increased bonuses.
During the whole history of the office, the
management havingalways recognised thefact
that there is ample scope for all, have never
found it necessary to adopt some of the
tactics resorted to by smaller and less suc-
cessful offices in their attempts to secure
business. Comparisons are at all times
odious, and we often regret to notice the
managers of L fe offices, issuing comparative
statements purporting to show the superiority
of their office over others, while the matters
compared are not alike. It would be mani-
festly unfair to compare the working expenses
of an office in its early stages, engaged in
extending its
agencies
throughout the
country, with
those of an old
office, whose
agencies have
been established
for some time
and who are
now engaged in
consolidating
their business.
It would also
be very unfair
to compare the
many points of
the working of
an Industrial
Office with that
of an ordinary
office, but com-
pared with the
results achieved
by offices in
England, trans-
acting a similar
class of business,
the Citizens’ in
many respects
stands in the
front rank.
There is recorded in “ Bourne’s Insurance
Directory” tin proceedings and business
done by every office of importance in England,
Ireland, and Scotland, there being given
returns from 18 of the largest Industrial
Life Offices—although all of them are not
known as Life Offices, some being called
collecting Friendly Societies, but, standing
on the same footing, are so dealt with by
Assurance authorities at Home. From these
• returns we find that for the past year the
Citizens’ takes high rank, and is not by any
means the least. The Citizens’ stands higher
in the list in actual income than eight and
less than ten. But, in the amount added to
funds, there are only six above the Citizens’,
which is superior to twelve ; and, in per-
centage of income saved —a most important
point—the Citizens’ stands at the very top of
the tree.
Assurance, like any other commodity,
might be had too cheap, and it shows con-
siderable foresight on the part of the Direc
tors of the Citizens’, that they charge
reasonable rates for the benefits which they
give, and sensible men will not forget the
fact that if they want a good article they
must pay for it.
To conduct an Assurance office on strictly
fair and straightforward lines, requires the
aid not only of shrewd business men, but
also of professional men—men who, from
their social and commercial position, are not
likely to connect themselves with anythin
shady. The result has been that the Com-
panies, whose aims and objects have secured
for them the services of such men, have
gained for themselves the confidence of the
public, and attained success accordingly.
One such company is the Citizens’, of
which, as an institution of purely Australian
origin, we feel proud. In this issue we give
portraits of the directors and chief officials.
The directors are well-known citizens, whose
faces are no doubt familiar to many of our
readers:—Mr. J. P. Gar van, M.P. (managing
director), and Messrs. W. J. Lyne, M.P.,
John See, M.P., Frank Coffee, F. B, Free-
hill, M. A,, S. H. Hyam, J.P., Dr. Power,
directors ; Win. Alexr. Smith, secretary ;
Dr. JM. .1. Clime, chief medical officer, and
(tie branch officials already named.
A man’s duly is to take care of liis

Mr. W. NIMMO DEWAR,
RESIDENT SECRETARY, VICTORIA.
the danger of the accidents that attach them
selves to all things human, whereby the
breadwinner may no longer be able to do his
work, which then would devolve upon the
remaining members of the family. How ill
fitted the untrained wife and the inexperi-
enced children are for that kind of work may
be seen any day in any communiiy of the
land, and the man who lias a proper affection
for his fall lily will seek to prevent that trial
by every means in his power.
The chief disturbing accident or possibility
in human life is death ; and just as a man
would use ’every possible means to prevent
the death of his dear ones, so he should
strive to protect them from the evil results
that would flow from his own death.
Me. JOSEPH BUTLER,
RESIDENT SECRETARY, QUEENSLAND.
A man’s first duty, therefore, is to insure
his life in some responsible company, and
thus make sure the future existence and use-
fulness of the home that he has built up with
the power of his brain and hand.
Any of our readers who contemplate
affecting a life assurance should, before
definitely deciding, send for Citizens’ pros-
pectus and see for themselves. The office
is in every way deserving of the support
which has been accorded it by the working-
chasses throughout the whole of Australia,
and from the good work it is doing it may,
without doubt, be emphatically described as
the “Workingman’s Friend.”

Before Alfred Deakin took to politics he
ivas a leader-writer for the Melbourne Age. A
well-known Irish wit, meeting the editor of that
journal one day, airily remarked : “ I say, you
ought to have something more than a Deacon in
your office —something higher—you ought to have
i bishop on your staff. ” “A bishop! \Vhy so?”
•‘Because your statements are so sadly in need of
xmfirmation.” — Pall Mall.
Sir George Stephen, father of the late
Judge WilberfOrce Stephen (Vic.), and himself in
his day one of the best known of down South
public men, was the author of two books-—the
first a volume of “Hints on Horse dealing the
second a “Life of Christ.” Of the first, two thou-
sand copies were ,sold; of the other, ten copies
only. This discrepancy would seem to imply that
people were tolerably sure of their way to Heaven,
but doubtful of their capacity as horse-coupers.
The Rev. Charles Price, of Launceston
(Tas.), who still flourisheth within a short cooee of
a century, was the last man to shake Johnny
Fawkner’s hand as he stepped from Launceston
old wharf into the boat which was to carry him to
the schooner Enterprise, lying out in the stream
ready for that trip which founded Melbourne.
For several score of years the old gentleman kept
a school at which, among others, many a man
now well-known in Sydney was put into the way
he should go—but didn’t.
Railway Commissioner Eddy, of N.S.W.?
is taking criminal libel proceedings against som e
of his press critics, or, as he prefers to term therm
the slanderers who have been maligning him.
The allegation which most riles Mr. Eddy is that
he has been guilty of many acts of corrupt nepot-
ism ; this he strenuously denies, and it is said to be
mainly with the object of forever disposing of it
that he now takes proceedings. He claims to
have endured with great patience numerous press
attacks, but, finding that some of his enemies (the
names of whom The Bulletin could guess in three
tries) have gone to the expense and trouble of com-
piling a pamphlet full of libels and distributing it
wholesale by post, he has determined to come
right out of his shell and deal with the matter in
one act. The other side of the story, whatever it
may be, will no doubt be set forth in court. It is
no secret that theN.S.W. Railway Commissioners
have incurred much enmity by the extensive and,
it is alleged, unjustifiable scale on which they
have been,importing officers_ from England to dis-
place local men of long service.
“Major” Isaacs, who represents Wal-
worth in the Commons, had the cheek to address
a semi-religious gathering in his constituency
while the charge of intimidation brought by him
against his mistress, whom he is alleged to have
originally seduced, was pending. Isaacs is a
paunchy, bald-headed person with a bill discount-
ing air, and the woman is a thin-lipped, fair, cold-
featured woman who, in court, was at her best
when she looked loftily at her egg-skulled lover,
and was dressed in the style a rich vulgar man
might have been expected to admire.

George Helle, a sober German plumber?
married, and the father of three children, a good
husband and affectionate family man, hanged
kimself the other day in Melbourne, because he
had been live months out of work. He had borne
his troubles with apparent philosophy and had
never outwardly complained. Before killing him-
self he turned the face of his wife’s portrait to the
wall and pat two mirrors “in mourning.” Then
he strangled himself. What is hell ? Hell is to
love your family and see them hungry.”

The Gentiles have been triumphant in the
Salt Lake City elections. It monogamy becomes
law there, what a heap of grass-widows will be
floating round in search rf engagement! Joaquin
Miller, who has been visiting Salt Lake City,
says : “If you put polygamy away the average
Mormon is a mighty g> od Christian —a better
Christian in almost every way than the average
Christian, so called. Xow, this is the truth. I
know of no Christian, rich or poor, who is willing
to fast every 30 days in order to give all his food
of that day to the 'poor. Yet every Mormon does
this voluntarily and continually. 1 know of no
Christian, although I do know of some Jews, who
gives one-tenth of his income to his church. Yet
every Mormon does this continually.” M hich
reminds us that a bill for the institution of poly-
gamy is seriously mooted in Tasmania, the y- ung
men of which fan’ country, being unable to obtain
local unployment, emigrate to Australia, leaving
I their sisters behind them. The Bulletin sees no
j serious social objection to the scheme, for if a
I girl can’t get a whole husband she surely should
jbe allowed to secure a fracti nof one. However,
there might be some difficulty in getting the royal
I assent to such an advanced measure—although
' Tasmania has had at least one Governor who
i passed a private polygamy aet for his own benefit.

NTIPODEAN CLIMATE.
MIDWINTER IN JUNE, MIDSUMMER IN DECEMBER,
HAVE THEIR BANE AND ANTIDOTE.
The climate of this Australasian continent of
ours, taken as a whole, is well suited to the Euro-
peans ; it is remarkably healthy, saving such com-
plaints as are not generally fatal in their tenden-
cies, and which in a measure are more or less com-
mon to all climates. Our climate is peculiar in
some respects ; it is usually very dry, and subject
in summer to hot winds and periodical droughts,
and in winter to heavy rains. The seasons are the
reverse to those in England—December being mid-
summer and June midwinter. But these condi-
tions of temperature are in a physical sense provo-
cative of nerve troubles from the long spells of dry
weather which merge into a long continuance of
wet. In consequence, among the minor ills which
affect the flesh, we have neuralgia, but the bane
has its antidote, as the experiences which tollow,
will show Mr. Alf. Hay, of Boomanoomana,
N.S.W., suffered at one time terribly with neu-
ralgia, and was cured by St. Jacobs oil. Second
Officer Win. H. Hawes, P.M.S.S. “City of New
York,” says : “I obtained astonishing relief from
acute neuralgia of the face by using St. Jacobs
oil.” Mr. W. H. Mathieson, the well-known
coachbuilder, of Dee-street, Invercargill, N.Z.
says: “An apprentice of mine was taken ill with
neuralgia, and became delirious. He found relief
from one application of St. Jacobs oil.” Mr.
William Walker (Walker, Lemon & Co.), 12
Lonsdale-street, Melbourne writes: “I suffered
from a severe attack of neuralgia—pain intense—
and after two applications of St. Jacobs oil the
pain ceased magically, and has never returned.”
The death rate of the Australasian colonies for
1830 was as follows New Zealand 11.46, Western
Australia 13.24, Queensland 13.59, Victoria 13.70,
South Australia 14.85, New South Wales 15.57,
Tasmania 16.12. The mean of the colonies was
14.01. In England and Wales the rate on an
average of 30 years appears to be 22.3.
MASTER MARINER’S OPINION.
The popular Commander of s.s. Iberia writes as
follows to the Adelaide agent of the Waterbury
Watch Co. ;
“Pacific Steam Navigation Company’s
“ R.M.S. Iberia,
“ Adelaide, 12th March, 1890.
“Dear Sir, —I beg to state that I have carried
with me during the past two years one of the
short-winding Waterbury watches. It has proved
a most reliable timekeeper, and I find it most useful
at sea, as moving the hands about does not seem
to affect its accuracy.
“ 1 remain dear sir, yours truly,
“Wm. Waddilovk, Lieut. R.N.R., Commander,
“ per Thos. Kidd.”
NOTE.—
“Nought treads so silent as the foot of time.”
—Young.
Lose no time in getting a Waterbury.
The Waterbury is a strong, hands'me, service-
able, well-finished watch, has nothing to fear from
ridicule, no dread of exposure.—
CAUTION. —If you want correct time and a
watch which, in event of accident, can be cheaply
! repaired, demand the WATERBURY WATCH.
1 All watches manufactured by the Waterbury
I Watch Co. have the word “Waterbury” printed
in small fine type upon their dial faces, and also
the interwoven letters W.W. Co.

Good old George Coppin treated the “ Try
Excelsior ” band boys, and a number of their re-
deemed young chums, to a colossal blow-out hi
Melbourne recently. After they had defeated
the tucker with great slaughter, a boy fired off an
original poem at the Hon. George and presented
him with a framed collection of the band’s photo-
graphs, this appalling collection of pictures being
the proceeds of a £5 note subscribed by Lad)
Clarke when she heard the originals play “ Tin
Heath of Nelson." Proceedings terminated with
the baud playing something which was very nearly
the Death of Coppin.

WHAT THE LEADING
DOCTORS AND CHEMISTS SAY.
“No Medicine introduced to the public has
ever met with the success accorded to Dr. Soule’s
American Hop Bitters. It stands to-day the best
known curative article in the world. It is famous
by reason of its inherent virtues. It does all that
is claimed for it.”
“ Gentlemen, —No medicine has one-half the
Sale and gives such universal satisfaction as your
American Hop Bitters. As several remarkable
cures have been made here, there are any number
of advocates for your medicine.”
“ I have constantly used American Hop Bitters
for the past four years in cases of indigestion,
debility, weakness, and in all diseases caused by
poor and bad ventilation, want of air and exercise,
over-work, and loss of appetite, with the most
per. ect success. ”
“ The greatest nourishing tonic, appetizer,
strengthener, and curative known to the medical
profession is Dr. Soule’s American Hop Bitters.”
“For all cases of diseases of the liver, stomach,
bowels, or kidneys, I daily recommend the use of
Dr. Soule’s American Hop Bitters.”
“ In my practice I am constantly prescribing
your Hop Bitters, and have found every case
relieved by their use.”
“ I can heartily recommend the use of Dr.
Soule’s American Hop Bitters.”
“■Gentlemen. —Your medicine will cure when
all other remedies fail. ”
CAUTION.—See that each bottle has

CORRESPONDENCE
“T.d.S.”: Many thanks “Ole Hoss ” ;
Won’t gee “ Cuthbert Brown ” : Your apology is clue
to us, not Mark Twain.... “ Cave Camem ” : May be use-
ful,O.L.R.”: Tub Bulletin’s constant endeavour is
to create a National spirit; when Melbourne is sufficiently
imbued with it the formation of local societies for its pro-
mulgation will follow as a matter of course Granville ;
(1) The Council are not responsible to the finance com-
mittee. (2) They could vote him the amount as a
reward for good service rendered, not as past salary. (3)
No. (4) It depends altogether on the wording of the vote.
(6) Take legal advice.... “J.C.” (Dunedin): Thanks....
“J. Dowling ”: Might suit the Protectionist daily.
. ;..“Jas. D.” (Woodend); Not in our style...
“J.L.S.” (Nymagee); Thanks....“ L.”: Try again, and
write only on one side of each piece of paper ...
“Skitastic”: The shadow of Gordon hangs over it all.
Botch has also a finger in the pie. You must not regard
these remarks as insulting....“ Hard-Up” ; Sorry to say
it won’t do. Something infinitely superior would suit....
“ A.W.E.”: For instance, Sir James Paget says; “I
would maintain that, so far as I can judge of the brain-
work of different persons, they have done the best and
most who have habitually and temperately taken alcoholic
drinks.” Tins is the experience of every unprejudiced
.nan. Trot out your great teetotal poet, novelist,
journalist - aye, or even your great teetotal operating
surgeon “ Veritas ” (Maytown) : Excellent ... “ Hora-
tio E.” : Until now we have received no verses. (2) The
Bulletin doesn’t consider honest poverty a reproach, but
then dishonest poverty is just as reprehensible as dis-
honest riches. We couldn’t say more if we were to write
for a month.... “ E.C.8.” : Let George and his apologists
properly face the confiscatory objection to the Single-tax
scheme. So far they have fenced with it .. “J.P.B. ’
(Corowa); Your story wants a lot of alteration ; will
return it with note . “ Jimmy Pannikin ”: Many thanks.
“J. Campbell ” (Lucindale, S.A.) : Yes, we believe
them to be thoroughly square. The promoter will permit
anyone nominated by you to attend the drawing....
“ Tinnenburra ” : Roma is an incorporated borough and
not a city. “ City ” (in early days most cities were re-
publics), civilly considered, implies self-rule ; ecclesiasti-
cally regarded, the see of a bishop. In some of the
colonies Parliamentary consent is required ere a town can
become a city. A town is a numerous assemblage of
houses incorporated as a municipality. Australian con-
ceptions of the words differ from both English and
American... “Reader” (Tas.); About six millions ...
Your “ Pills” we cannot swallow. Your best
verse is—
“ 0, Sydney is the place to mash,
There is no doubt about it—
For dudes and those with heaps of cash,
But hell for those without it.”
“Robert Brown”: Thanks—“C.L.R.” (Melb.):
Thanks. Quite right. The fact occurred to us when
100 late.... “ John M.”: Will read and consider ...
“ J.L.S.” (Nymagee) ; A good story for Mr. K.’s friends,
but for Mr. K.’s friends 0n1y....“ Skitastic” : Thanks;
will read and consider....“ Robert E.” : Fair verse when
somewhat altered, but as the subject is not of pressing
interest it may stand ..“ T.W.IV’; Will read your letter
and reply....*' D. R. Watson ” (<).): We have not heard...
“ Anxious ” (Ballarat): The extract mailed is clipped from
an advt. in The Bulletin. Consult a good man.. .
“Victorian”: Many thanks; dealt with “E. M.
Makins”: The Bulletin advocates land-nationalisation
not land-confiscation ; (2) The Bulletin is not, never has
been, and never will be, so far as we are concerned, op-
posed to an equitable land-tax; (3) The Bulletin sees no
reason why a man who has bought out of his savings a
piece of land, even of city land, should be penalised while
those who have invested their money in usury shops go
f ree “A. Henley ” ; You don’t understand. A ban-
ner is a symbol ; if you are fighting the cause of the
ragged let your banner be rags, not because you struggle
to establish the universal wear of rags, but simply because
“rags” correctly symbolise the position of those driven by
necessity to doii them. Anyhow, a blouse is a healthier,
more convenient, and graceful garment than a frock-coat.
“ T.M.” (Merri M.): Great Scott, we take it, is a cor-
ruption of “Great God.”. ..“P.A.”: Too much water
is a new trouble at Bourke ; it was always too much
whisky in our time “Radical” (Tas.): Thanks
“E.E.”: The Single-taxers have no ground, and the
Single-tax has no grounds .. “T.W.P.” ;We much regret
vour misfortunes, but cannot see how we can help to
redress them “A.L.”; Thanks “Taraballa”: Metre
and sentiment hopelessly at variance “T.L.”: No,
“ Lady Munro ” is not related to Lady Mordaunt. To
settle' the matter, we have ascertained that there were
seven Miss Moncrieffes. Louisa married the Duke of
Athol; Helen, Sir Chas. Forbes ; Georgiana, Lord Dudley ;
Harriet, Sir Charles Mordaunt ; Blanche, Mr. Chas.
Murray ; Fanny, Sir Alex. M. Mackenzie ; and Mary, Basil
Montgomery, a* brother of the Duchess of Buckingham
“Dandy” (Adelaide): The chief points of a popular
M.L.A. are;—Very large feet, ranging from 23in. to 2!>in.
in length by-12in. to 17in. in width ; head, conical; jaws
of flexible ‘toughness ; upper lip, extensive ; cheek, im-
mense ; bushy eyebrows, low forehead, scurfy hair ; eyes,
furtive; chest, deep and wide ; bingie, deeper and wider:
legs, bowed; tongue on swivel; coat, nondescript and
owed for ; hat, various ; umbrella, borrowed ; linen, cellu-
loid ; skin, tawny; thirst, insatiable and incurable. Go
ahead and win, if you can fill this bill.

The Anheuser Busch Brewing Association em-
ploys 2200 men at its brewery in St. Louis. It is
customary to allow all employes a liberal supply
of the famous St. Louis Lager Beer for their own
consumption while at work, the beer being drawn
from packages ready for market. The beer thus
consumed amounts in value to £3O per day, and
sometimes reaches £4O, or about £lO,OOO a year.

The live Scotch directors of the Melbourne
Evening Standard are quite satisfied with its
progress. What a boom it must he !
Tow, row, row,
John Lam out Dow,
Says he isn't in the humour
To resign just now.
1. Winter, an "Australian native” of
Richmond (Vic.), wants to go and explore the
South Pole. No go; the South Pole has its own
universal winter.
Governor Carington says he is going to
stay out his full Australian term of office, and
that it is untrue, us alleged, that he has already
taken some flats in London. The latter rumour
The Bulletin believes to be based on the fact
that his Ex. has been taken by a lot of *’ flats in
Australia, who rent him for about £15,000 a year.
If you would have a thorough change from
the country, you cannot do better than secure
rooms at the Grand Pier Hotel, Manly, which has
been entirely re-furnished, and is now being con-
ducted in first-class style. Its location is one of
the most beautiful anywhere, and the attractions
include a perfect cuisine and unchallengeable
wines and liquors, unrivalled sea-bathing, enjoy-
able steamer-trips up and down Sydney Harbour,
the most lovely drives in Australia, and excellent
fishing down the coast.
Now that the Lochs have gone, one or two
little stories are creeping into the ears of the
vulgar public that would indicate that all was not
so nice as it seemed between them and Premier
Gillies—-doubtless owing to Lady Loch's belief
that no one not born an aristocrat should have any
peceadilloes of the Don .) uanesque order. One of
the latest stories is that Kahler was given sittings
for his picture of “ The Lawn ”by both the Gov.
and Gillies. When His Ex. saw the portrait of
the latter, he said: “Haw, not unlike, but not
voluptuous enough.” Gillies got home with:
“ That the Governor ? Really, 1 should not have
recognised him. You have made him too hand-
some and intellectual-looking ! ” Wfih'cli left
neither top dog.
Stanley has a rare knack for conceiving
situations—he is a born bookmaker. He is nearly
as good as Parkes at making history. At the
execution of the ringleader of the mutiny against
the departure of Emin Pasha, he worked up the
situation in a way worthy of Handsome George.
First, Stanley is sick, and has, “ by the force of
his determined will ” (which phrase is pretty well
threadbare), to be carried outside his tent, and
tints addresses the wretched culprit : “ We have
come thousands of miles, through thousands
of dangers, to rescue you, and this is our
reward. Go to God ” (not to hell, mind yon,
as a common Australian would have said.)
Naturally this was rather vague, and the
crowd around wanted to know the means of
i transit to the celestial presence. With lean figure
the great explorer points to an overhanging bough
and the prisoner. “Send him to God,” lie says,
and by means of a rope lie is sent there ! Turn on
the limelight. If this is darkest Africa how are we
going to set an example of civilisation? Why, the
old P.M. up North who told the police-sergeant re
the drunk to “take him out and hang him”
comes out just as well.
The brother-in-law of a murderer lately
hanged at Wagga (N.S.W.) has just committed a
murder in Tasmania. Another conclusive proot
of the efficacy of capital punishment.
In Thebes lately the Egyptologists found
a papyrus 70 feet long, and 15 inches broad. It is
beautifully illuminated, and contains hieroglyphic
extracts from the famous and mysterious book of
theUead. The whole is to be photographed. Copies
will be obtainable by the Sydney and Melbourne
Public Libraries, In fact, we think they are to
be got now, if the authorities only bestir them*
selves. The papyrus is about 4,000 years|old.
The “Colonial Year Book, 1890,” which
has been fulsoincly praised by the London press, is
a not-too-intelligently-done rehash of out-of-date
information originally supplied from official
sources.” In the section of New South Wales, as
regards the past, Flanagan’s spurious version of
Governor Phillip’s inaugural oration is quoted as
authentic; and as to the present, anyone not
knowing better would gain the impression that
the colony has a State religion—Anglicanism.
A long, bony Melbourne larrikin, who
probably felt tired of life, spotted Prof. William
Miller walking down Bounce street with a lady
one day last week, whereupon an uncontrollable
impulse to “shove up against ’ William took
possession of this misguided wretch. Four times
did the Professor earnestly, yet softly, request
the long object to leave off shoving and depart in
peace—in one piece. The. lady also expressed a
hope that they would take him away before he
was killed, but the gathering crowd just grinned
and waited for the blow to fall. It was after the
fifth shove that the blow fell. The Professor’s
“ right made a strategic movement, a sound like
the cracking of a Brazil nut in a front door was
heard above the city’s din, and the larrikin lay
stretched across the tram-line as Miller went
marching on. The Professor had knocked his
persecutor about 36 feet at one fell swoop.
The Shall has granted a railway monopoly

I’otntate dirty,
Fickle and flirty,

What do you mean by it,
Heathen unclean by it,
Vexing the Queen by it?
The Eastern soup thickens,
Australia it sickens,
• Shah, go to the dickens !
Says London Echo :
lu “Tasma,”authoress of “ Uncle Piper ot Piper's Hill”
wc have one of the two or three precursors of Australian
literature. It is evident that the hand which wrote
“ Uncle Piper” is capable of original work of a very high
order. Australia appears to he far more precocious in the
production of a truly native literature than any other
English-Speaking land outside the old country. Of
American literature, it could have been said, for genera-
tions, that it might as well have been written iu the
Mother Country. One reason for this distinction is that
the Australian ideal of life is far less materialistic than
that of America.
The rowing gaffers of Sydney are gradually
being cornered by O’Connor. The latter lias only
to be watched in one regard ; he must not be per-
mitted to scoot to Yankceland after deposing a
false Australian champion. A big sweepstake
would best settle the championship question.


A Melbourne Freemason has been lodge-
censured, because he said anothe - Mason got his
living by it. A lot do it, for all that. They sniff
out all the dinners, for one thing. . Aha ! Here’s
Brother Gourmand ! Give him the grip. Turtle-
soup, one. Teal on toast, two.
If Sir Alfred Stephen publishes in his
autobiography all he knows about “ our first fami-
lies,” what an interesting volume it will be ! The
man who was Crown Solicitor in Van Dieman’s
Land 65 years ago, can a tale unfold respecting
the ancestors of “ our landed gentry.”
The plans and elevation of the new Argus
office, Melbourne, show a comparatively modest
structure, of three stories. There is no pretence
of show, the sole consideration being adaptability.
People thought there would be some emulation of
the Tribune, Herald, and World buildings, in
New York, but the fact is a newspaper never can
fill up such places with its own work.
Mrs. Harrison Lee, a young lady of Rich-
mond, Melbourne, announces the publication of a
new book on “Marriage and the Social Evil.”
This will largely expand some views she has ex-
pounded both in the religious and secular press of
Melbourne; but the editors, in both branches, got
frightened and put the brake on, Mrs. Lee is
prominent in the religious world, and will outdo
Mona Caird.
Many years ago, says an English magazine,
when George Francis Train was in Australia, the
captain of an ocean steamship was fined heavily in
court for ejecting on his latest voyage six male
passengers from the ladies’ saloon of the steamer,
the rules forbidding their entering that cabin. He
had not enough cash. Could not raise it. Could
not appeal and the delay in sailing would ruin him.
Train, who was a spectator, stepped forward and
got permission of the court to advise the captain
in private. After a lapse of half-an-hour he re-
turned, and was about to address the court, when
one of the magistrates asked where the captain
was. “I don’t know,” said Train, “he is no
client of mine. I left him outside.” Search was
made and a line of black smoke in the offing
showed that the captain was off for England.
Edison has developed his idea of using the
photograph ip conjunction with the phonograph
to register a speaker’s personality.—
In front of the speaker are placed two small machines,
one a phonograph and the other an ingenious piece of
mechanism by which photographs of the speaker are
taken in succession with enormous rapidity at intervals of
from one-eighth to one-twentieth of a second, and both
these machines are at work silently recording both the
uttered speech and the personal appearance of the speaker
at each fractional part of a second. The results thus ob-
tained may be sent to any desired point and the photo-
graphs thrown on a screen by an ingeniously-contrived
piece of mechanism. Thus the exact appearance of a
speaker, with all his gestures and play of features, is
exactly reproduced, while the phonograph simultaneously
delivers the speech. The interval between the successive
photographs is so infinitesimal that the screen picture is
apparently a living one, moving, gesticulating, and appar-
ently uttering the words which in fact are spoken by the
phonograph. The greatest difficulty experienced by
Edison in his experiments was the synchronization of the
two instruments, so that the utterances of the phonograph
should exactly coincide with the gesticulations; but this
was finally overcome, and the experiments were crowned
with perfect success.

The Grand Duchess of Baden says she can
never forget that her late mother, the Empress
Augusta, told her that—“A princess must never

people who support them who get tired.
A London amateur boxer, having been
killed by compression of the brain—through the
rupture of small blood-vessels in the surface of its
covering caused by concussion following on blows —
an inquest was held. Coroner : “Then every time
a man is ‘ knocked out ’ or becomes insensible he
is in danger?” Surgeon : “ Certainly he is.” Larry
Foley and the Gymnastic Club committees should
paste this in their hats, unless they hanker after
manslaughter prosecutions,
A Lancashire bridegroom was lately mar-
ried on a drizzling Sunday morning, and, there
being no wedding-breakfast, the parson detained
the party for the morning service. At its con-
clusion the bridegroom, who had been looking
very melancholy, said to a friend, “Oi wouldn’t
hev corned at all if Oi’d known it was going to be
so glum.” And on getting outside the church
and finding that it was raining he took to his heels
and bolted home, leaving his bride to her own
devices.
The Sydney Nation, started “to advo-
cate the claims and maintain the rights of the
Irish Catholic minority of N.S.W. and Austra-
lasia generally,” has suspended publication, “ hav-
ing once again been deceived by hundreds on
hundreds of definite pledges of support —the
pledges of self-styled subscribers not too proud to
take in the Nation weekly, yet too mean to hand
over the payments due to us for regularly supply-
ing it to them.” Moral; If you are in Australia
you can’t get a living out of Ireland.
Surely Bismarck is in the right about
Hanover, The Hanoverian king chose to take
the Austrian side against the Prussians in 1866,
and shared in the defeat. Now Queen Victoria,
his relation, has been wheedling the German
Emperor, who is ready, they say, to hand over a
large pile of money to the ex-king in settlement of
imaginary claims. Bismarck says no, and the
nation is with him. Money settles everything
with the House of Hanover. Princess Alice’s
husband, Prince of Hesse, had two gorgeous
uniforms ready, in the Prusso-Austrian war, to
don the colours of the victorious side.
A terrible lot of Lord Mayor’s banquets,
leg-shows, royal flummery, and other expensive
luxuries, seem to have been wasted upon the Shah
of Persia, in London. They laid on a special
telegraph service to his State apartments at
Buckingham Palace, gave him a telephone to play
with, and let him slaughter bullocks on the hearth-
rug. Victoria by the Grace went so far as to
shut her eyes to the fact that some of the Shah’s
“ male ” suite were really Persian girls in disguise.
She sat next to the malodorous heathen, and pre-
tended not to mind a bit. In return for all these
concessions the goggle-eyed monster, it is cabled,
handed over the control of his railways to Russia,
and sits swilling sherbert while the British Lion
totters down Piccadilly, mumbling “ euchred
again ! ” It’s too disgusting !

Nothing is known to science at ail comparable
to the Cuticura Hemedies in their marvellous
properties of cleansing, purifying and beautifying
the skin, and in curing torturing, disfiguring, itch-
ing, scaly and pimply diseases of the skin, scalp
and blood, with loss of hair from infancy to age.
Cuticura, the great Skin Cure, and Cuticura
Soar, an exquisite Skin Beautifler, prepared from
it, externally, and Cuticura Resolvent, the now
Blood Purifier, internally, are a positive cure for
every form of skin and blood disease, from pimples
to scrofula.
I have had a most wonderful cure of salt rheum.
For five years I have suffered with this disease. I
had it on ray face, arms and hands. I was unable
to do anything whatever with my hands for over
two years. I tried hundreds of remedies, and not
one had the least effect. The doctor said my case
was incurable. I saw your advertisement, and
concluded to try the Cuticura Remedies; and
incredible as it may seem, that after using one
box of Cuticura, and two cakes of Cuticura
Boar, and two bottles of Cuticura Resolvent, I
find lam entirely cured. Those who think this
letter exaggerated may come and see me and find
out for themselves. GRACE P. HARKHAM,

I have been afflicted since last March with a skin
disease the doctors called eczema. My face was

cluded to give them a trial, using the Cuticura
and Cuticura Soap externally, and Resolvent
internally, for four months. I call myself cured,
in gratitude for which I make this public statement.

Editor Pike’s New Departure.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
The amours and bitterness of the common,
domestic obituary poem and its attendant jour-
nalistic wickednesses, the birth and marriage
proclamations, which tend to elevate the
soul and burnish up her mental attributes, have
not been entirely exhausted by the gaunt and
soulless human objects who fabricate long links
of irreverent literature for the comic papers,
as has been evidenced by a new phase'of wretched-
ness that has recently appeared in the domestic
column of a small and dreadfully solemn organ
run in the interest of liver-pills and lung-blisters
in a lost and disconsolate township called Cooney-
bungle, South Australia.
The Cooneybungle Bugle is under the dreamy
supervision of a stunted literary individual named.
Pike, who has worn all the nap off his‘head
wrestling with European complications and sup-
porting the awful aggravation and weary respon-
sibilities of propelling and controlling a Weekly
paper with only the assistance of an offensive and
dunder-headed small boy. Mr. Pike is an under-
done and tremendously depressed gehtleman with a
stealthy, sidelong gait, and a face expressive of all
the deeper emotions of a prize Swede turnip; he
devotes a great deal of the time and attention
that should be spent in pushing and furthering
the Bugle to indulgence in beer and other native
products of a kindred nature, and is occasionally
seen spread about in public places in a state of
mental and physical incapacity at moments of
great importance to the well-being of his valuable
journal.
Towards the end of last year a brilliant original
idea, having for its purpose the spread and wider
popularity of the Bugle, occurred to Mr. Pike,
and in an early issue of that brainy and popular
organ an announcement to the effect that the pro-
prietors, always anxious to increase the usefulness
and interest of their paper, would in future, on
the 30th of every December, publish a summary of
all marriages and births advertised in the Bugle
during the past year, also an In Memoriam over
each late-lamented person whose death had been
notified in their columns within the same space of
time. The aforesaid proprietors cunningly intimated
hopes that their enterprise would tend to encour-
age the births, marriages, and deaths in the
neighbourhood, which institutions certainly par-
took of the general depression in business in and
about Cooneybungle. The Bugle, of course, had
only the interest of the township at heart in
making this departure, and was confident the
residents would do their best to second its en-
deavours and make the birth, marriage, and
death-rate of Cooneybungle second to none in
Australia.
The idea evoked immediate expressions of pub-
lic approval; the residents were not expected to
pay anything, and that alone was sufficient to ex-
cite their hearty co-operation. At the instigation
of the local doctor, a meeting of prominent inhabi-
tants was held for the purpose of taking into con-
sideration the best means of expressing their high
esteem for the character and ability of Mr.
Joachim Pike, the editor of the Cooneybungle
Bugle. The doctor, two clergymen, and the
undertaker addressed this meeting, and dwelt in
glowing terms upon the beautiful morality of Mr.
J, Pike and his untiring efforts for the good of the
township. Dr. Kidd instanced the Murphy-street
drain, the post-office lamp and the Burnt Creek
bridge, as lasting monuments of Mr. Pike’s
indefatigable zeal, and remarked that this last
sacrifice in throwing open the already sorely-
pressed columns of the Bugle, with a view to
accelerating the local birth-rate, proved that he
was fully alive to the most pressing necessities of
the township The doctor hoped all present
would unite in giving their able editor a fitting
token of their appreciation. The Rev. Peter Pope
had long been animated by the keenest admiration
for Mr. Joachim Pike’s literary abilities, and felt
that his wonderful penetration in discovering the
infrequency and irreligious reluctance with which
the young people of Cooneybungle contracted
matrimony, and his self-sacrificing endeavours to
ameliorate that evil deserved some return ; and
then the reverend gentleman started off on a
lingering dissertation on the impiety of single life,
and was overtaken by. the chairman an hour, later,
and called off to make room for Brown, the under-
taker. Brown said old Pike was a smart fellow ;
he knew a thing or two ; he could see that some
people remained alive away beyond reason and
religion—lived overtime, so to speak—to the
ruination of business and public morality, and was
not afraid to tell them so. He (Brown) had a
great admiration for the editor of the Bugle, and
would be happy to supply him with a German-
silver • mounted coffin gratis, if he would step
round and leave his measure. The meeting
resolved unanimously to tender Mr. Pike a public
banquet at an early date.
Mr. Pike got his banquet—it was a small,
inexpensive banquet, consisting chiefly of wet
refreshments,-and it was bought and paid for by the
doctor, the undertaker, and the clergymen. But
Joachim was modest in his desires, and manifested
his appreciation of the fare provided by getting as
drunk as time and circumstances would permit.
He was carried home in the morning on an arm-
chair, and returned to consciousness some hours
later, animated with an unconquerable desire to
protract the festivities.
The next number of the Bugle was looked for-
ward to with considerable anxiety by the people of
the township, few of whom had not experienced
either a birth, death, or marriage in their families
during the past twelve months; but when the
paper came out a sudden chill fell upon the
general expectations, and Cooneybungle retired
within itself, abashed, to cogitate and endeavour
to unravel a great waste of tangled-up birth-and-
death proclamations and distracted in-memorial
at the Bugle sufficed to convince its
numerous subscribers that its gifted editor must
have been violently drunk just prior to its publi-
cation ; the promised column looked as if it had
bean struck by lightning and then printed in a
mangle .expressions of howling despair and
bottomless grief were hashed up amongst songs
of rejoicing'and heartfelt congratulations, and all
the most influential gentlemen of Cooneybungle
were, given due, pro vocation to get up in. tumultu-
ous bitterness add kick the enlightened Bike and
welt him with a waddy from Dan to Beersheba.
Whether the aforesaid offensive small boy ha
inadvertently.-knocked the stuffing out of a form
and then filled it again according to the dictate
of his own mildewed conscience, or Joachim, m
one of his fits of vinous aggravation, had set the
matter up regardless of law and order, has never
been made known, but the Bugle’s new departure
was a miserable- failure, and moved large, raus-
cular residents to call upon Mr. 1 ike in his °mee
and express their sentiments and invite that
gentleman ofit'to fight; but they found the guiding
intellect and full staff of their only journal spread
in an attitude of abandon on a pile of exchanges
-,iu a dunib, solid slumber brought on by rum.
Despite kicks and profane expostulations the
editor maintained his somnolent composure, and
his interviewers, each armed with a Bugle, dropped
one by one into the Old Coach Hotel to ventilate
their grievances and invite sympathy. Here an
impromptu public-meeting was held, and Doctor
Kidd w4s voted to the chair.
The doctor was painfully agitated and ruth-
lessly undone; he arose and flourished a Bugle,
and without preliminaries stigmatised Bike as a
debauched reprobate- and an old, bald-headed,
rattletrap scoundrel, with no conscience and no
reverence for the finest emotions that animate the
human bosom.
“You all know,” said the raging medico,
“that early in March I was united in the holy
bonds of wedlock to Mrs. Stretch, t the relict of
your late respected poundkeeper. Hear what
MR. C. W. GOODCHAP.
this low-minded, rum-ravaged animal of the
Bugle has to say of that joyous compact ”
KIW)-STRETCH.— On the Bth of March, at St. John’s
Church, by the Rev. Amos Boland, Dr. William Kidd
to Mrs. Mary Stretch, daughter of Mr. Heflernan
Stretch, of Liverpool, England.
Not many months have sped since he
Was reft of all the joys of life
And laid in that cold, cruel bed ;
But, ah ! tho’ here we suffer strife,
And pain and anguish ring our brows,
We feel it all is for the best,
And in that Paradise above
We yet may know a perfect rest.
“There !” yelled the doctor, growing extremely
red and tearing up the paper he held, “ there’s a
pretty way to speak of one of the happiest unions
ever sanctioned in Heaven ! 111 give him ‘perfect
rest,’the low. brainless outcast! I’ll make him
‘suffer strife,’ the animal—the mean, crawling,
doddering object of abhorrence!”
Here the medico sank gasping into his chair and
feebly mopped the leakage off his bald tract with
a bar towel, and the meeting proceeded in an
informal way.. , ~
The next complainant was a tall, thin, placid
man who begged to state, without heat or preju-
dice,’ that Joachim Pike, editor of the Cooney-
bungle Bugle, was everything low and degraded,
in nature and several supernatural things detest-
able to humanity, and he requested to be allowed
to move a motion that that meeting, without
further consideration, seize upon the person of
that wretched man, dip it in a barrel of tar, and
roll it down a hill overgrown with thistles. He
called the attention of all present to the Bugle s
notice of the birth of his tenth daughter :
MORAN.-On the 11th of June, at Graham-street, the
wife of A. Crawford Moran, of a girl, the only daughter
of the late John Sheehan, of Belfast, Ireland. No
cards. Home papers please copy.
Mr. Moran drew attention to the ambiguity of
this intimation in quiet, but forcible, language,
and said that if Pike could not keep wholly
irrelevant birth and marriage notices from
coalescing in that disgusting manner he was
quite unfit to run a paper, and ought to be
hung to prevent further complications. He ob-
served, moreover, that the utter villainy of the
man was to be seen in his request to the Home
papers to copy the report anrl thus reflect upon
the character of Mrs. Moran in a country where
she had hitherto been regarded with respect and
reverence. , , •
The Rev. Mr. Pope then got up in a state of
rage ill-befitting a man of his cloth and com-
plexion, and x’cad : —.
POPE.—On the 21st of September, at her late residence
, 42 Grant-street, Jane, the only wife of the Rev. 1.
Pope, after a long and severe illness. Both doing
well.”
The reverend gentleman went on to say that
such a notice was enough to convince all thinkmg
men that Editor Pike was an atheist and a scoffer
at all good, human or divine. He solemnly as-
sured all present that there was a place prepared
for the devil and his angels and the man who
could publish a notice like that. To say he was
“doing well ” after the death of his dear wife was
a base and malicious libel, as everybody knew who
had witnessed his grief and seen him weighed
before and since. „
Brown, the undertaker, next took the tloor.
Brown had been married a few months prior, to
the daughter of the local publican, and in the
Bugle the record of their nuptials got mixed up
with the following In Memoriarn, bearing on some
late lamented young lady :
Weep not for me, my parent dear,
Cut off in early bloom
From all I loved and cherished here,
And wedded to the tomb.
Wipe off the briny tear-drops now
That down your dear face run.
Drive wrinkled care from off your brow,
And say—“ God's will be done !”'
Mr. Brown seemed to think that rather
rough on him somehow, and hastened to revoke
the promise of a coffin which he had made to Pike,
and alluded to that literary individual through-
out a long harangue in unvarying terms of bitter-
ness ; he said he was inconceivably abject in mind
and ugly and insanitary in person, and he offered,
should the meeting agree in its wisdom to destroy
the editor, to undertake to bury him with the
utmost ignominy at his own expense.
After these a long list of severely distempered
men and ladies started up to ventilate their
grievances, and lay their cases before the meeting,
and offer suggestions for the harassing of Editor
Pike. One large, fierce female was awful in her
wrath, and thought Pike ought to be boiled
because of the following ;
PURDEY—SHANNON.—On the 12th of March, at the
bride’s residence, by the Rev. P. Pope, John Purdey to
Matilda Shannon. May he R.I.P.
Mrs. Purdey resented the insulting inference in
that “ R.1.P.,” and lamented the fact that
Joachim had no hair by which she might haul him
a mile to drop him down a mine.
A gentleman named Jones used a lot of intem-
perate language and violent gesticulation previous
to reading this to the assembly
JONES—LYNCH.—At St. John’s Church, Cooneybungle,
on the 6th of May, 1889, by the Rev. A. Boland, Ed-
ward Jones, of Graham-street, to Miss Elizabeth
Lynch, second daughter of Barnard Lynch, of Cross
Cut, S.A.
In affectionate remembrance of my beloved wife Helen
who passed away on the 3rd of February, 1889; —
She was a loving wife and true
Whilst here on earth she stayed,
And when above the clouds she flew
And with the angels played
' *n golden harps, my broken heart
To follow her was fain.
Dear wife ’twas hard from thee to part.
But soon we’ll meet again.
Inserted by her sorrowing husband, E. Jones.
This was simply a little over-sight in giving the
notice of Jones’ second marriage in conjunction
with his obituary poem for Mrs. Jones No. 1, but
Jones seemed to consider it a matter of great
gravity, and offered to hang Pike and find the
rope if the meeting would only lend its moral
support.
One man who was young and rash took pas-
sionate exception to the fact that the dates of his
marriage and the birth of his first child were re-
versed, and another tabled this as justification for
his awful wrath
BUCK.—In loving and affectionate memory of her grand-
father, the wife of Mr. William Buck of a son. “The
Lord givoth and the Lord taketh away.”
The rest of the birth-and-marriage notices and
obituaries were all either incoherent blocks of
“pied ” typeor drunken and incapable verse, or con-
tained more or less implied aspersions on the
moral character or mental capacity of the persons
mentioned therein, and the demand for blood rose
to a mania in and about Cooneybungle ; but after
calling Editor Pike everything fearful and dis-
agreeable in the English language and giving dua
deliberation to the case, the meeting resolved no)
to resort to bloodshed, but to appoint a deputation
of eight to wait on the journalist and demand an
explanation and a retractation of everything, and
then to tar him and let him loose.
The deputation appeared at the Bugle estab-
lishment in office hours next morning, thinking to
catch the editor sober when their admonitions
would have due effect, but were grieved to learn
that Mr. Pike had been called away to visit a sick
aunt in Adelaide. The shock-headed, vicious
small boy imparted this information from a top-
story window, and then carelessly spilt a lot of
used-up machine-oil on the deputation of eight
and withdrew.
There was no issue of the Bugle for three
weeks, and when public animosity had got cold
and flaccid, Editor Pike managed to get out an
edition containing a full and complete apology to
everybody mentioned, and a good many who were
not mentioned at all, before the people were aware
of his return, and as yet no murder has been re-
ported from Oooneybungle.
EDWARD DYSON.
Mr. C. W. Goodchap.
Charles William Goodchap, architect, of 184
Pitt-street, Sydney, whose likeness appeam else-
where, is a nephew of the well-known Mr. 0. A.
Goodchap, M.L.A. Mr. C. W. Goodchap, whose
father was the District Civil Engineer at Kurnool,
Madras, is a native of India, and was educated
under the Rev.. Thom, at Doveton College,
Madras, Bishop Cotton’s Grammar school,
Bangalore, and at Hanwell College, England, and
the private college of the Rev. Dr. Swam,
M.A., and was then articled to Charles Goodman
Mumby, the well-known London architect. Mr.
Goodchap afterwards increased his experience by
working under Architects Thomas Durrans and
Sir Charles Street on the magnificent New Law
Courts and on the Metropolitan Board of Works
under Mr. Valliamy, chief architect to the Board.
He then began to practise for himself in Queen
Victoria-street, London, where he was very sue-
cessful until ill-health impelled him to visit Aus-
tralia. On arrival Mr. Goodchap, who holds a
certificate for drawing from the South Kensing-
ton Institute, and is a member of the_ Architects
Association, received an appointment in the office
of the Colonial Architect, Sydney, but resigned
his office to enter business on his own account 4i
years ago. He has since been largely engaged in
surveying and architectural designing, and among
his more important works may be enumerated the
branch offices of the City Bank at Kiama, Goota-
mundra, Young and Armidale, buildings costing
considerably over £4,000 in each instance. Many
private buildings in the neighbourhood of Sydney
are the products of Mr. Goodchap’s skill and
varied experience.
Queen Victoria showed her contempt for
Parliament not only by refusing to deliver the
opening speech, but by going to Osborne while it
was being drafted, thereby causing some members
of the Cabinet to make several trips across the
Solent.
The Melbourne University authorities,
presumably on the grounds of modesty, have pro-
vided the lady-students with a separate dissecting-
room, and now the students want to know if the
lambs should not be also drafted from the goats
in hospital surgical practice. Pending develop-
ments, “some of the senior male, gtudents have
expressed their intention of absenting themselves
from all operations at which women are present.”
Your average young woman is, whether from
innocence, ignorance or mental differentiation, far
less modest —or shall we say bashful than your
average young man, but a course of the ballet soon
makes the latter callous, while the former gets, as
a rule, more aggressively modest in male society
with single-agedness.
Stuart Cumberland writes that on one
occasion, while staying at Petty s Hotel, Sydney,
Sir Arthur Gordon (the hideous caricature of
Royalty who used on occasion to make himself
ridiculous by wearing a State-train held up
by pages) entered the drawing-room in which his
wife and some other ladies were seated. Lady
Gordon at once rose up, and it was not until her
husband had left the room that she resumed her
seat. “ Why did you get up like that ?” asked a
lady friend. “Oh, Sir Arthur expects it” was
the reply. “He may expect it at Goyernmcnt
House, but here, in a public hotel, the thing is too
absurd,” rejoined the lady, with considerable m-
“We Australians don t nnrjer&tand
such nonsense.” Now why on earth should a man
expect his wife to arise in his presence because he
lives at Government House? That Australian
woman must have been a lovely snob.
The Tories are making a good deal of
Professor Tyndall’s speech (a single sentence of
which only was cabled to the loyal colonies) in the
Ulster Hall, Belfast, but a perusal of the entire
diatribe shows it to have been very ordinary hog-
wash. Take, for example, the following re Mr.
Gladstone
In view of the blood vainly shed on Majuba Hill, of the
noble Irish, Scotch, and English lives wrecked amid the
deserts of the Soudan ; in view of the immolation of those
splendid Arabs who fought so devotedly for their country
and their faith ; in view, above all, of the sacrifice of the
heroic Gordon at Khartoum-sent out by Mr Gladstone
to suit his own purposes, and then abandoned to bis fate
—in view of all this I express not only my profound con-
viction, but the conviction of many sober-minded men,
when I say that this English statesman, judged oo-
iectivelv, and in reference to acts brought about, not,
perhaps by his intention, but by his mismanagement,
cowardice, and vacillation, is the wickedest man of our
day and generation. (Applause.)
Tyndall, like many other prominent Unionists, is
a renegade Irishman (Carlow), and being close on
80 years of age is probably in his dotage, bull a
great man, even if he be in his dotage, is just now
a welcome accession to the party
In a pinch, Lord Ballyraggum
Is better than no lord at all.


THUI BULLETIN iPuolisheU. u,l bydney, N.S.W)
The Unique Weekly, Australia’s Nonpareil
Illustrated Newspaper.
The Bulletin, the Premier Australian Literary
Journal, is the only paper which has a con-
sistent and distinctive Australian National
Policy.
The Bulletin favours—
A Republican Form of Government.
Payment of Members.
One Man, one Vote.
State Revenue derived diiectly from the Land.
Complete Secularisation of State Education.
Reform of the Criminal Code and Prison
System.
A United Australia and Protection against

Imperial Federation.
The public eye rejects as uninteresting more
than half of what appears in the newspapers of
the day. It is only the other half that is found
in. The Bulletin.
The Bulletin is an aggressive Democratic
paper which strives to exclude from its artisti-
cally-condensed columns all matter which is not
of general human interest. The Bulletin was
started seven years ago with no capital but brains,
and has become a vast property, because it pos-
sessed a Vitality lacked by the countless news-
paper-ventures in which Australian capitalists
have unavailingly spent large fortunes.
The Bulletin’s conductors claim that every
progressive paper on the Australian continent has
more or less endeavoured to profit by its example
and follow its lines. The result of its powerful
influence and its unprecedented literary and com-
mercial success can at once be seen by comparing
the methods pursued by the Australian daily and
weekly press prior to and immediately after the
first issue of The Bulletin.
From the date of The Bulletin’s inaugural
publication its success was assured. It had at
once a dozen more or less servile imitators, many
of which even took, so far as was possible, its
name. They are now all dead, while The Bul-
letin continues the one phenomenal success in
Australian journalism, the one completely non-
local and distinctly universal Australasian news-
paper.
The Bulletin proprietary have, during the
last year, spent some thousands of pounds in
fitting their buildings with the latest appliances
for high-class printing and the production of illus-
trations, and they have now issued The Bulletin
in an entirely new form—printed with new type
of improved legibility on the finest paper, and
adorned with sketches from the hands of the
ablest and best-paid newspaper artists Australia
has ever seen.
The Bulletin is the only well-established Aub
tralian journal which, throughout its career, has
been consistently Radical. It points with pride
to the fact that for yours it stood alone among
secular newspapers in advocating the Irish
National Cause, and that it was the only Aus-
tralian journal which denounced the Soudan
Expedition from its iuccption.
The voice of The Bulletin is the beacon-fire
of national progress : it is the forceful summons to
the crusade against the monopolies in land,
■ wealth, power, and privilege—the direct cause of
half the misery which now afilicts British
humanity. Against the claims of avaricious
clergy who claim to monopolise salvation, against
the dark despotism of grasping plutocrats, and
against the exorcise of any human authority
which has not been granted by the people over
whom it is exercised. The Bulletin will fearlessly
and ruthlessly contend.
The Bulletin, unlike the ordinary weekly
journal, is not loaded with a weight of matter
transferred from' the Columns of a daily paper
issued from the same otlice. The Bulletin is
not connected with any other paper, and the
matter it contains is all specially prepared by its
own unequalled staff.
The Buli.etin, which is the only paper sold
by runners in the streets of every Australasian
capital, is the most widely-circulated of all papers
published south of the equator, and is the only
Australasian publication which enjoys a popu
larity unhampered by the political boundaries
that so closely restrict other journals to the
colonies in which they are printed.
The Bulletin's red cover is equally familial
to the bushman of the Far North, the stockman
of Central Australia, the pearl-shcllor of Torres
Straits, and the digger in the Now Zealand
Ranges. A paper which is at once the
most popular city publication and the organ of the

The circulation of The Bulletin in Sydney is
unrivalled by that of any other weekly journal,
and more than a hundred copies of it are sold in
Melbourne to one of any other paper printed but-
side that city. Perhaps the strongest proof of The
Bulletin’s popularity is found in the unchallenge-
able fact—easily ascertainable from any postal
official—that,’of all journals issued in Australasia,
The Bulletin is the one most frequently re-
mail cd from one reader to another.
The Bulletin is the journal which, of all Aus-
tralian journals, is most frequently quoted in Eng-
land, America, and the colonics.
The Bulletin is going ahead faster than any
other paper, because its .vast mass of original and
Specially- written reading-matter is-the brightest
and best, its illustrations the cleverest and most
artistic, and its policy the boldest and most
straightforward ever submitted to the Australian
public. . . •

IJHE EQUITABLE LIFE ASSURANCE
Society of the United States.
ASSETS ' ~ ~ Ti I £21,800,000
ANNUAL INCOME ... « £6,250,000
SURPLUS .. .. .. £5,600,000
The Equitable’s record for the year 1889 in
every point of view presents the most extraordinary
exhibit in the history of life assurance. It sur-
passes that of every other Life Company extant.
Some idea may be formed of the magnitude of
the invested funds of the Equitable Life Assur-
ance Society from the fact that they exceed the
combined funds of the eleven Australian Life
Companies, as given in the January number of
“The Australasian Insurance and Banking Re-
cord,” by more than £7,250,000 sterling.
Australian Branches.
It is now about six years since the Equitable
Life Assurance Society of the United States com-
menced business in Australia, and during this
period it has issued in Australasia a larger amount
of Assurance than any other Life Office has done
in the Australian colonies during the first six
years of its existence in these colonies.
The establishment here of the Equitable Life
Assurance Society marks an epoch in the practice
of Life Assurance in these colonies, and has been
the means of introducing many reforms in the
practice of the Australian Life Offices.
The confidence and patronage of the public are
the more gratifying when it is borne in mind that
.from the advent of the Equitable in Australia the
managers of some of the local offices have, in a
spirit much to be deprecated amongst Life Assur-
ance Companies, adopted a tone of hostility
towards the Equitable.
Reforms. /
The Equitable has ever been foremost in intro-
ducing and adopting reforms tending to the
security, comfort, and convenience of its policy-
holders. Founded under a most strict and severe
form of Government supervision, it has, neverthe-
less, from time to time invited the most searching
investigation by independent actuaries and valua-
tors unconnected with the staff of the society;
and such examinations have greatly assisted the
Equitable in prosecuting its business, as its great
financial strength has been thereby authoritatively
established. The good management of the Equit-
able, no less than its strength, is conclusively
shown by the fact that its assets exceed its liabili-
ties by more than 27 per cent.
Protection of Policy Holders.
The Equitable Life Assurance Society has ad
voeated, and will at any time welcome any fair
and uniform legislation in Australia WHICH'
WILL EFFECTUALLY PROTECT THE
INTERESTS OF ALL POLICY-HOLDERS;
WHETHER THEY ARE ASSURED IN
LOCAL OR, FOREIGN OFFICES. Will tfie
local companies cordially assist in setting up the
strict and uniform standard of valuation which
would be required for this purpose ?
Valuation Standard.
So far, no local office has advocated the compul-
sory use by all companies of a uniform pure
premium standard of valuation, based upon the
Actuaries’ rate of mortality and 4 per cent, rate
of interest. Without some such uniform standard
it would be impossible to determine the sufficiency
of the assets held by any company to meet its
liabilities.
Unequalled Strength.
The Equitable Life Assurance Soeiety of the
United States has more assurance in force than
any other Life Company in the world. It transacts
more new business. It has a larger surplus,
measured by the strictest standard of valuation.
Its organisation in Australia gives to the assured
all the advantages of a local office, and, what is
more, the security afforded by the strongest Life
Office in the world.

The Most Useful Ointment in the World,

PREMIER OINTMENT is the SOUTHERN
HEMISPHERE. But, as many new arrivals
have lately made New South Wales their home, it
may be as well to let them know that there is such
an : rticle as JOSEPHSON’S OINTMENT purely
the production of the colony, composed of wild plants
indigenous to the country and nowhere else, the
principal of which is the EUCALYPTUS, now
so famed thoroughout the world.
Josephson’s Ointment is purely vegetable,-and
Guaranteed Free from all Poisonous
Qualities. No Artificial Colouring, as the
Green colour is extracted from the pure green
plants, which defy imitation.
WHO SHOULD SUFFER FROM PILES,
when one application will relieve you ?
Read -this letter and Try for Yourselves
Messrs. E. Row and Co.
Dear Sirs, —I have tried your Josephson’s Oint-
ment for Piles, and have found much relief from
using it. You are at liberty to use this if you feel
disposed.

IiTUDY HEALTH BY TAKING ROW’S
O STEANE’S BITTERS.
The great demand throughout the colony for
these pure Bitters shows they are superior to all
others and equalled by none.
Facts Speak Louder than Words.
Read this sworn testimony from a well-known
citizen: —
Statutory Declaration.
“I, George Hewett, do hereby solemly and
sincerely declare as follows ;
“ That I feel it a duty I owe to the public to
state that I have been suffering for many years
from weakness of the stomach, so called INDI-
GESTION or DYSPEPSIA, and have been cured
by my taking two or three glasses of ROW’S
STEANE’S BITTERS a day in a little water, and
I hope others suffering from the same complaint
will be as speedily cured.
“(Signed) G. HEWETT,
“ 215 Pitt-street.
How’s Bteane’s Wine
Is a safe and sure stimulant for the female sex or
children, for it raises and strengthens depressed
systems without producing a temporary excite-
ment to be followed by greater depression.
Persons suffering from loss .of appetite and
general depression of spirits cannot do better than
take ROW’S STEANE’S WINE.
It cannot harm you, but must do good, to all
delicate persons. Young Ladies can ta)*g this
when suffering from general debility. It’s only a
pure tonic. Try it.
Teetotallers will find this newly-invented
TONIC answer all the purposes of a stimulant
without its intoxicating quality. It will satisfy
the cravings of nature and create a desire for food
instead of drink. As an anti-febrile is unsur-
passed.
ROW’S
DANDELION
BITTERS.
We recommed these BITTERS to be taken
two or three times a day; a wirieglassful for an
adult, smaller quantity for children.
For General Debility, Dyspepsia, Rheumatism,
and Cutaneous Affections.
The action of dandelion, more especially upon
the liver and kidneys, in more reliable for remov-
ing all impure secretions than any other medicinal
plant known.
Persons suffering from Skin diseases will find
these Bitters invaluable.
DIRECTIONS FOR USE.
One wineglass two or three times a day after
meals diluted with same quantity of water. For
young people about half the quantity twice a day.
They Purify the Blood and Liver.
See what a Medical Gentleman says
about them.
Messrs. E. Row and Co. ■'

“Millionaire” Abraham Biggs, of Haw-

has been proved at only £1(30,000. He was a great
friend of the Churches, and was always ready to
assist them —with his valuable advice.
From a recent leading article in the
Times, and endorsed by Lord Brassey :
We are proud of being partners in a business of dimen-
sions without parallel and difficult to realise, and iw are
resolve i to keep whole and undivided the family that has
created it, and in whose hands it is desirable that the
business should remain.

Onofroff, a new thought-reader, is finding
pins at one of the London theatres. He was
green enough to try experiments on our old friend,
Stuart Cumberland, but was not successful with
the rival showman. When Cumberland pretended
to think about one thing he probably concentrated
his mighty mind on something else, thereby bring-
ing poor Onofroff to confusion. Which somehow
reminds us of a schoolboys’ game called “ Buck,
buck.” One boy sits on another boy’s back and
says, “Buck, buck, how many fingers do I hold
up?” When the buck guesses right the rider
generally says he guessed wrong, and so the game
goes on until the buck collapses from exhaustion.
Whether the buck is a good thought-reader or not
doesn’t make the slightest difference to the astute
boy on top.
A South Australian jury recently brought
in the following verdict: —
We are of opinion that the fire... was caused by
some person or persons unknown, but there is no evidence
to show how it originated.
Mr. Frank Guest, of Waverley, one of
John Shepherd’s chief supporters at Paddington
parliamentary election, attended one night during
the last N.S.W. “general” a political meeting at
which Sir Henry Parkes spoke in support of Mr.
Shepherd, who, seeing the Foreign-trade chieftain
appear very fagged, told Guest to get a bottle of
champagne for the old man. Guest, who also felt
fagged, at once sent out for a large bottle of fizz,
calculating that it contained enough for two. On
the arrival of the wine Guest took Sir Henry into
an ante-room, opened the bottle and filled H.P.’s
man’s glass. Then he filled it again, and again, and
again, and then twice more, and then the Freetrade
idol went out and talked very hard. A year after-
wards Mr. Guest, who had first met Sir Henry
under the circumstances just set forth, and who
meanwhile had been chosen as Mayor of Waverley,
waited on him as one of a deputation. A word
with you, Mr. Mayor,” said Sir Henry as the
deputation was retiring—“ I ’ad you very nicely on
the occasion of our ♦‘rst hinteryiew.” “How’s
that?” inquired Mr. Mayor. “ Ah,” said Parkes,
in his little treble, “you thought you were
going to ’ave some of that champagne, didn t
you ?” tSir ’Enry has a long memory.
