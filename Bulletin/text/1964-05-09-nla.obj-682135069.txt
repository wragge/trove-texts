PRAKTICA cameras and Mercedes-Benz have several things in common.
They are both among the oldest and most respected German manufacturers
in their fields. Long years ago, when many of today's cameras were not
even thought of, PRAKTICA were making fine cameras. Today, like the
Mercedes-Benz radiator and star, the appearance of the PRAKTICA has
changed very little. But inside, every worthwhile feature of a good SLR
has been built in to make it the finest camera you’ll ever use. With
PRAKTICA you have the choice of 25 interchangeable lenses, 28 mm. to
1,000 mm. See your HANIMEX Dealer soon. Let him show you the full
PRAKTICA system of camera models, lenses and accessories. Ask him to
explain the versatility of PRAKTICA and you’ll understand why more Aus-
tralians have bought PRAKTICA than any other brand. Models £39 to £65.
The 1964 PRAKTICA Book, containing 247 pages, is now available from your nearest

LETTERS
TO THE
EDITOR
TRADE WITH RED CHINA
Sir,
May I congratulate both The
Bulletin and Sir Wilfred Kent Hughes
on the letter you published from Sir
Wilfred on trade with Red China
(25/4/64). It is, in my humble opinion,
a masterly summary of the position.
The Prime Minister of Canada made
the same point when he said at a rally
in London on 4/11/58: “Trade has
become a major weapon in the Com-
munist world offensive. The Communist
drive is designed to undermine the
economy and strength of the free
world.”
Major-General J. F. C. Fuller in his
book, “The Conduct of War, 1789-
1961”, states that Mr Khrushchev’s Cold
War policy is to break away from
Lenin’s concept of the inevitability of
war between the Communist and Capi-
talist countries, and to substitute the
economic attack for the military attack.
, We should all ask ourselves: Is it in
the long-term interests of Australia to
provide our avowed enemies with
powerful support in the economic war
which they are waging against the free
world? Are we not bolstering up re-
gimes we all hate?

JUDGING A POPE
Sir,
Brian Buckley’s commentary on “The
Representative’’ (18/4/64) raises again
the problem posed by Mauriac not long
alter the war when he said that it was
a cause of great grief to him as a Catho-
lic that Pius had not expressed public
disapproval against the massacre of the
Jews. The problem is whether a Catho-
lic can in fact judge the Pope and it is,
of course, not new. When Savonarola
brought his charges against Alexander
* * (Borgia) it was represented to him
that it was necessary for a Catholic to
recognise that the dignity of Peter re-
mained even in an unworthy Pope.
It is certain that Pius was not un-
worthy as a Pope; those nearest to him
were convinced of his sanctity. This is
no defence against the charge that has
been made, but it does indicate that for
a Catholic the Pope is not open to

judgment only by the standards that are
to be applied to “all honest men”: that
he has a profounder responsibility and
awaits a profounder judgment. “The
Representative” is open to judgment as
a play and also as a historical repre-
sentation. These are judgments that
critics can make independently of their
faith, but it would be most difficult of
all for a Catholic to have the standard
by which to judge the Pope as the Vicar
of Christ.
This being so, it is obviously in the
interests of everyone if the historical
problem is clarified as rapidly as pos-
sible. It has become clear since the war
that no material help was given by the
Vatican to those Catholic groups assist-
ing the Jews, despite the requests that
were made. But on the face of it, it
still seems unlikely that the Vatican
should have felt no involvement with
the Jews if only for the fact that Catho-
lic Jews were dying in the concentration
camps. Perhaps the most famous
Catholic convert of the generation, the
philosopher Edith Stein, the pupil of
Edmund Husserl, died in this way after
being a Carmelite nun for ten years. As
to the suggested tactic, this had already
been tried when a public protest was
made to Hitler about his persecution of
the German Protestant Churches, and in
his reply Hitler had made it plain that
he was completely indifferent about the
diplomatic relations that existed between
his government and the Papacy. It was
for this reason that the Pope had re-
tired in protest to Castelgondolfo when
Hitler came to Rome on his official
visit.

THE DFRB SCHEME
Sir,
In your article “Fairbairn Confuses
the Issue” (21/3/64) you have clearly
set out the major anomalies. Until now
most servicemen had regarded the
DFRB scheme as a gigantic swindle into
which they were forced to pour their
contributions without realising just how
the scheme operated. I personally know
of one case where an RAAF officer with
more than nine years’ service resigned
his commission and received from the
DFRB scheme his own contributions
only less a book-keeping charge. Instan-
ces such as this mean that servicemen
now realise that their suspicions of this
scheme were well founded, but as service-
men are allowed no say in the con-
ditions under which they serve, the con-
stant question is, what can the individual
in uniform do to rectify matters?
There is one way in which members
of the public can support the service-
man in his present one-sided battle for
better conditions. Officers and former
officers of the three services are being
actively canvassed for contributions to
help meet the legal expenses of the
test case to come before the High Court
next month. Your readers will recall
from previous articles in The Bulletin
that this case involves a number of off.
cers whose resignations have not been
accepted. It is reasoned that a favorable
decision in this case will force the Com-
monwealth to improve the conditions of
service, and in particular the DFRB
scheme.
While not myself a member of any
of the Armed Forces, I have nevertheless
contributed to the fund, as I consider]
basic freedom is in jeopardy the right
of an individual to work for whosoevei
he chooses.
For the benefit of any readers who
may not know how to send contributions
to help defray legal costs, the address
is: High Court Fund, Post Office Bos
67, Albert Park, Victoria.

THE ADELAIDE FESTIVAL
Sir,
I much appreciated your features on
Adelaide's Third Festival; the article bj
Patricia Rolfe was enlightening for read-
ers throughout the Commonwealth. Ii
had, however, one inaccuracy; it said, in
connection with a new theatre for the
1966 Festival, that the expected theatre
would be at Elizabeth, 30 miles from
Adelaide. The distance from Adelaide
to Elizabeth is 16 miles. The connectin!
road is the Main North, one of the bes
in the Commonwealth.

WOOL RESEARCH
Sir,
When it became evident towards the
end of last year that the International
Wool Secretariat and the Australian
Wool Board in the near future would
be operating with vastly expanded
budgets, the reaction of many wool-
growers might have been expressed in
those word of wisdom from the Bible:
“Where the carcase it, there will the
eagles be.”
But I do think that not one wool-
grower could have been found who
would have expected that the very iW
vulture to swoop down on that fat car-
case would have been one of his own
associations the Graziers’ Association
of NSW. The day after its special con-
ference had decided to support the in-
creased levy for wool promotion and
research, a move was begun within its
governing body with the object o
having a portion of the fund provided
jointly by growers and the Government
expressly for wool research diverted to
a project of an entirely different nature
they wanted some research money
used to help finance a sheep meat re-
search laboratory in association with
the Australian Meat Board.
Remarkable as this may seem,
stranger things were to follow. At the
annual conference of the Graziers
Association of NSW, held in Sydney
during the week commencing March

1964, the assembled delegates rejected
the motion “that the application of wool
research funds to mutton research be
opposed”. The only logical conclusion
to be drawn is that the woolgrowers of
NSW as represented by the Graziers’
Association are quite happy to contri-
bute 2 per cent of their wool clip to
ensure that their product is not swamped
out of existence by synthetics, and then
stand idly by while the money provided
for wool research is diverted to other
uses.

“WAR LORDS”
Sir,
At the risk of butting into a private
argument between Geoffrey Fairburn
and J. D. Legge, I would suggest that the
question of whether Dr Soekarno and his
underlings are referred to as “War lords”
or not is of rather academic interest.
When I commanded one of HM gun-
boats up the Yangtse some 30 years ago
we described the members of various
private armies which fired on foreign
ships as “bandits” and the locals called
us (the foreigners) “the running dogs of
imperialism”. It depends on a point of
view. From a western point of view the
acts of expropriation by Indonesia and
her war against Malaysia could be des-
cribed as “gangsterism” and “banditry”.
But Professor Legge poses some seri-
ous questions when he asks what changes
should be made in our present policy.
“Australian troops in Sarawak immedi-
ately? Australian bombs on Djakarta?
A trade boycott? Or what?” A recent
survey of the relative strength of Viet-
nam and Vietcong ground forces esti-
mates the ratio as five to one. The anti-
communist war in Malaya required a
ratio of from 10 to 15 to one.
As Britain, Malaysia, Australia and
New Zealand are unlikely to be able to
raise the required ratio of land forces,
and as a protracted land campaign in
Borneo could, like operations in Malaya,
drag on for years, serious consideration
should be given to a blockade of Java
which could be enforced by the navies
of these four nations. Such a blockade
would probably result in the fragmenta-
tion of the Indonesian empire, with
Sumatra joining Malaysia and the end
of the rule (correct word?) of Dr Soe-
karno. Indonesia presumably faces chaos
in any case, but out of the crucible of
fragmentation something stable should
eventually emerge.

ABORIGINAL ADVANCEMENT
Sir,
Your correspondent is to be con-
gratulated on his informative and
balanced article (11/4/64) on the
annual conference of the Federal Coun-
cil for Aboriginal Advancement. How-
ever, I wish to draw your attention to
a few errors of detail. The Director of
Native Affairs in Queensland is nw
Mr Killoran. In mid-1962 the Depart-
ment of Native Affairs was transferred
from the Department of Health and
Home Affairs (of whom the Minister
was Dr Noble) to the Department of
Education (Minister, Mr Pizzey). ] (
was an all-party (Federal) Select Com-
mittee of seven that investigated the
Yirrkala question; and a (State) Select
Committee which is at present investi-
gating Aboriginal legislation in Queens-
land.

“BOBBY”
Sir,
I have just read your item “Bobby"
in “National Notebook” (28/3/64).
Your correspondent tells us Robert
Helpmann noticed more changes for the
better in the nine years since he was
last here in Australia in 1955.,,
Untrue, sir. Robert was here with
Vivien Leigh for “Duel of Angels” in
the early ’6os. Apparently he prefers
to remember his visit with Katharine
Hepburn for “The Tempest”, etc., than
his visit to North Queensland shores
with Miss Leigh. I remember at the
time Mr Helpmann was most co-opera-
tive with the local news reporters such
as myself, while Miss Leigh devoted
most of her time to avoiding us.

TUDOR HOUSE
Sir,
I would appreciate your help in
remedying a misconception in many
minds about the relationship of this pre-
paratory school with The King’s School.
I ask this particularly in view of a mis-
take made in an advertisement for teach-
ing staff for this school published in
The Bulletin some weeks ago under
the heading The King's School, Moss
Vale. This should have read Tudor
House, the King’s School of Moss Vale.
This preparatory school is controlled
by the council of The King's School but
boys leaving here go to many different
schools. Certainly the majority go to
The King's School but that is a matter
entirely of parents’ choice.

Sir,
It seems that you have been imposed

received, of February 28.

The common-or-garden-hose clip,
which many would think impos-
sible to export, is being sold by
the half-million a year to 25
countries.
Its dynamic Australian manufac-
turer has proved that a quality
product, produced at a competitive
price here in Australia, can be
sold at a profit overseas.
Too many manufacturers believe
that export is possible for only the
fortunate few, with exotic products
other countries don’t have. But
any exporter will tell you that
selling is the same everywhere;
a good product, sound pricing,
regular deliveries . . . and you’re
in business.
If you are not exporting now, talk
to the Department of Trade and
Industry. Or talk to someone who
is exporting. There are a wealth
of sound reasons and advice to
help you decide to “go inter-
national and grow.”
THINK EXPORT BECAUSE: You enjoy
demand in several markets not just ona
• added volume can lower unit production
costs • broader marketing knowledge
and skills will result • turnover can
stabilise and expand • profits can
increase appreciably.

National Notebook
Yesterday’s News
“The Press in Australia” by As-
sociate Professor Henry Mayer, of
Sydney, was published by Lansdowne
last Friday. Research and writing on this
subject took Professor Mayer, at present
in America, about 18 months. However,
one wonders whether such an ephemeral
thing as newspapers warrants such serious
consideration. The same day came the
news that both the “Sydney Morning
Herald” and the Sydney “Daily Mirror”
intend to publish national dailies emanat-
ing from Canberra. National dailies are
something new for Australia and their
emergence throws out some of Professor
Mayer’s carefully calculated figures and
well-considered conclusions.
Simple Man
Tohn Meillon is a pretty simple sort
” of chap. All he wanted when he
returned after five years in London was
to sit in a suite at the Chevron Hilton,
overlooking the harbor, and sip some
good old Aussie beer; just, in fact, to
sample the sort of simple life we all
lead out here.
Mr Meillon and his wife, June Salter,
who are old Phillip Thea-
tre hands, will appear in
“Rattle of a Simple Man”
at that theatre. He said
he had seen the play sev-
eral times in London
and had found it very
funny. It was, he said, a
change from the kitchen sink. It’s set
in a London bed-sitter (which sounds
fairly familiar territory for British
comedies) and concerns a simple sup-
porter of Manchester United in London
for the Wembley Cup Final. “Rattle of
a Simple Man” calls for a North Coun-
try accent, but Mr Meillon feels that the
play will be readily comprehensible to
Australian audiences.
Some of his London experience has
been providing Australian accents which
are comprehensible to English audiences.
Mr Meillon said it was pretty hard to
fool English people with Australian
accents of the Gawd starve the flamin’-
ciows variety these days. They knew we
didn’t all talk like that.
Mr Meillon has worked in films, stage
and TV in London and perhaps liked
TV best. TV gave a feeling of continu-
ity that you didn’t get with films, but
there was a tendency to return to live
television. “I don’t know what it
achieves,” he said, “except terrified per-
formers.”
Things had been quiet in films last
year, he said, but now there seemed
plenty of work. “Tom Jones” had been
a terrific shot in the arm to British film-
makers, who might now be able to move
out into bigger budget films again, and
away from the dank little North coun-
try masterpieces that were current
fashion.
Moving In
Tt looks as if another member of Ade-
"*■ laide’s Establishment will move into
the Representatives seat of Angas, left
vacant by the appointment of Mr Alec
Downer as High Commissioner in Lon-
don. Mr Geoffrey O’Halloran Giles has
been endorsed as Liberal-Country League
candidate. The Labor candidate, Mr R.
Nielsen, a Monash fruitgrower, is given
only a slender chance of winning the seat.
The first Giles came to Australia in
early 1837. William Giles set out with
his second wife and a multitude of child-
ren of two marriages. Complete with
drawing room furniture including grand
piano, they iived first in a large tent on
Kangaroo Island, and proudly entertained
Governor and Mrs Hindmarsh on their
first visit to the island with a sumptuous
dinner which started with
kangaroo tail soup.
Giles then moved to
Adelaide to become man-
ager of the South Austra-
lian Company, and if his
strict business principles
had not prevented him (he
was a strict Anglican-turned-Congrega-
tionalist) he could have bought for him-
self a large part of the city of Adelaide,
and left a fortune to his descendants.
Professor Douglas Pike, whose book
‘'Paradise of Dissent” traces the history
of South Australia from 1829 to 1857,
once remarked to your correspondent
that the Giles family was always “poor
but honest”.
Giles became a magistrate, was a
leading member of a committee forming
a Society for the Preservation of Religious
Freedom in South Australia, and also
worked for the building of a railway
between Port Adelaide and Adelaide.
Prof. Pike reports that at one stage Giles
refused to allow the S.A. Company’s fire
engine to attend a conflagration at the
local Port Adelaide theatre because he
believed its plays immoral! In 1851 Giles
became a member of the new SA Legis-
lative Council.
Today there are Giles descendants of
a more liberal turn of mind—mainly
members of the Giles and Stokes families
—scattered throughout South Australia
and inter-State.

Private enterprise
Writers’ Press, which some years
ago published a number of books in
Sydney, is operating again. It has now
published “The Wonderland of Nature”,
by Nuri Mass. This is a book on natural
science for Australian children. Miss
Mass believes that its scope is unique,
and hopes that it may become required
reading for primary schools. “The
Wonderland of Nature,” of 270 pages
and with lavish illustrations, which are
both accurate and attractive, is priced at
18s. 9d. The distributors, Horwitz, con-
sider this a giveaway price, as would
any sensibly-minded publisher.
The Writers’ Press, then, stands to
lose considerably on “The Wonderland
of Nature”, unless it is published over-
seas or becomes a classic here, but Miss
Mass is prepared for that.
The Writers’ Press was, and is, Miss
Mass. In its first flowering it consisted
of a second-hand press, stored in Miss
Mass’s garage. Miss Mass kept her type
in bottles and jars. The first publication
was her own novel, “Randy Blair”,
which she set entirely by hand. This
painstaking experience, she felt, equipped
her to proceed with her next publica-
tions volumes of children’s poems by
Lydia Pender, Dame Mary Gilmore and
Frances Hackney, all of which were
hand-set, but all of which sold out their
editions.
Miss Mass gave up the press about
seven years ago when her husband died.
“The Wonderland of Nature” was
printed by a commercial firm, but Miss
Mass is happy that the Writers’ Press is
in business. “Last time I was simply
inundated with manuscripts and I
suppose the same thing may happen
again,” she said.
Success in Syria
11/e’ve had word from Damascus,
” Syria, that Sydney artist, Lrank
Beck, has held the first exhibition of
Australian art in that country and sold
30 pictures to the Government into the
bargain. Since arrival in the Middle
East with his wife Dorothy, Beck has
lived in villages and shared tents with
Bedouins.
The full-page spread on the exhibition
in an Arabic language newspaper
(thoughtfully translated for us) says
“Beck has travelled all over our country
and loves it and the people. He will
tell the Australian people about Syria
on his return. He gives us advice as to
our treasures for which we are grated
. . . We are very happy to have him
and his beautiful lady in our city.”
In more colloquial vein, Frank Beck
describes the opening; “I moved ova
from my Arab tent into a pub. We have
a last drink and I say ‘Come on,
on!’ Down to the museum, a beautifi
building much bigger and more impo
ing than the NSW gallery. 1 had fills
three large halls and had to meet H
Excellency the Minister and his party,
the top of a flight of broad stain
Promptly at five, up they came, aboi
200 of them. I was introduced, muc
handshaking and off we go. No otht
artist has ever had a full-page interview
They told me, ‘You have captured tl
life of the people better than any of tl
many artists who have come here.”
Latest word is that Beck has be?;
offered a professorship of the Syria
Academy of Art.

Too Soon
To Shout Eureka
A LTHOUGH the ACTU decision
** last week to condemn Com-
munist manipulation of trade
unions through Shop and Area
Committees is welcome news —-
particularly coming so soon after
the election of Mr M. C. Jordan
as Secretary of Melbourne’s Trades
Hall Council—it is still too soon to
shout Eureka.
For one thing the ACTU held
back from the step that would
show it really meant business—that
is, adopting the policy of British
Trade Union Congress and disaffili-
ating Communist-controlled unions
as the TUC did with the Elec-
trical Trades Union. We may,
however, hope that this will come
in time. But of more immediate
importance is the fact that ACTU
moral support of unionists who are
prepared to throw Communists out
does not in itself produce the union
officials who will do the job. The
ACTU should now take steps to
encourage and train such men in
order to translate the new policy
from fine words into tough action.
Some unions, such as the Iron-
workers’ Association, have such
personnel to draw on—as we saw
when the Federation clamped down
on Communist members in New-
castle who planned a general steel
strike in February. But only a
few unions are as well organised
and clear-sighted as the Ironwork-
ers.
The rash of strikes planned and
directed by Communists outside the
trade union movement and execu-
ted through the Shop and Area
Committees could not have hap-
pened if the unions or the ALP
had had the men who know how
to deal with Communist manipu-
lators and were not afraid to do so.
Unless the ACTU develops such
groups of unionists, its resolutions
will be mere pious verbiage. Beau-
tiful thoughts without powerful
organisation to back them are a
waste of time.
There is, however, another point
that has to be made. Some big
employers have been playing into
the hands of the Communists by
invoking the penal clauses when-
ever unions strike as a result of
Shop Committee manipulation.
Since Communists make a point of
involving non-Communists in their
strikes, it is often these non-Com-
munists who suffer the financial
losses imposed by Arbitration Com-
mission fines.
The result is to embitter non-
Communist unionists and force
them into an unwilling alliance with
Communists. The onus is on em-
ployers to develop sufficient politi-
cal sophistication to avoid such
mistakes and to use the penal
clauses cautiously so that only
Communists will suffer financial
losses.
The Spirit of
Journalism, 1964
A PARAGRAPH headed “The
Spirit of Journalism”, in THE
BULLETIN of March 7, described
a small example of the betrayal of
professional standards by a sup-
posed leader of a profession. What
had happened was that Mr G. F.
Godfrey, who is both a member of
the NSW ALP Executive and Presi-
dent of the Australian Journalists’
Association, had opposed at a
meeting of the ALP Executive the
releasing to journalists of informa-
tion about 13 important policy de-
tions. In other words, the
journalists’ official President had
tried to conceal from journalists
facts of great public interest which
both they and their readers need
to know.
Fortunately other members of
the ALP Executive had a greater
respect for journalism than the
journalists’ President and leaked
the information to the Press despite
Mr Godfrey’s attempt to suppress
the news.
The matter may have ended
there as just another case of the be-
trayal of a profession from within,
But in the latest issue of “The
Journalist”, the official organ of the
AJA, Mr Godfrey had something
more to say. In the course of a
letter referring, without justifica-
tion, to “a characteristically in-
accurate paragraph in THE
BULLETIN”, and, sanctimoni-
ously, to “the newspaperman’s right
to political freedom”, and “the true
spirit of journalism of which THE
BULLETIN knows nothing and
cares less”, he attempts a justifica-
tion of his conduct. “1 do not feel
disposed,” he writes, “to act on the
ALP Executive as an ‘undercover’
leak for anybody or any organisa-
tion. To expect this,” he says,
“would be condoning a perverse
double loyalty.”
,
1S 1S P recise *y point. A
man cann °t expect to continue as
an executive of two important
organisations whose interests may
and sometimes do conflict. If as a
member of the ALP Executive he
feds contempt for the Press (un-
kke, fortunately, most members of
ALP) he should not continue
a s AJA official. The same
principle would apply if he were a
member of the Liberal Party
Executive, and the public, which
has as great a concern with the
integrity of journalism as of law or
Parliament, has a right to know the
facts.

RESTRICTIVE PRACTICES
Snedden Bulldozes On
Scorning the business world
FROM J. C. HORSFALL IN MELBOURNE
B. M. SNEDDEN
Testy
*The Attorney-General, Mr B. M. Sned-
den, did less than justice to critics
of the Federal Government's restrictive
practices proposals when addressing a
Victorian Employers’ Federation semi-
nar in Melbourne last week. He divided
the critics into those who did not under-
stand the proposals and those who were
trying to prove them unworkable. Time
is fast running out for those who want
the proposals scrapped, and even for
those w'ho still hope to influence the
drafting of the Bill which, in answer
to a question, the Minister said would
most likely be introduced in the coming
Budget session.
Mr Snedden also seemed to be a little
ahead of us in saying that, since the
public is not geared to express its will on
this subject, the Government had there-
fore to exert its own will in the matter.
Then, somersaulting, he claimed the
Government's victory at the last election
gave it an unequivocal mandate to go
ahead with the legislation.
In a determined mood, the Attorney-
General got quite testy with somebody
who denied the Government had a man-
date for the legislation, and another
questioner who implied it had modified
its original approach was given equally
short shrift. There may have been
modifications in detail, Mr Snedden said,
but the approach had been constant
throughout. On points of principle he
confirmed one's impressions that the
Government has taken little, if any,
notice of the main objections of the
business world to the proposals.
For instance, it has stuck to the first
idea of proscribing certain practices,
though in the case of two of the origi-
nal under this List B head, monopoly
and persistent price cutting at a loss,
Mr Snedden thought there was a lot
to be said for making them examin-
able in which case they would have
to be brought forward in the form of
complaints rather than be registered.
In the case of the other two in List B,
collusive tendering and collusive bid-
ding, he emphasised that when done in
pursuance of a registrable collective
agreement such practices w'ould not be
proscribed. On the other hand, when
done under an acl hoc arrangement and
wdth fraudulent intent, the latter two
practices would involve an offence.
Again, contrary to the advice of the
business w'orld, bilateral and unilateral
practices are to be kept in the Bill. On
the other hand, the Attorney-General
made it clearer than it has been to date
that he is mainly after the big offenders
in such vertical practices as retail price
maintenance, discrimination in pricing
and terms of dealing, exclusive dealing
and certain refusals to deal, wTere there
is strong economic power to control an
area of commercial life. Little busi-
nesses would not be in such a position
and as such would not have to register.
The Minister w'ent out of his way to
allay impressions that registration of
unilateral and bilateral practices would
be all-embracing. The legislation w'as
only out after restrictive practices oper-
ating against the public interest (whii
would be for the Tribunal to determi
though he defied anybody to defi
“public interest” or indeed “comp;
tion” and “negligence”). The “o a :
ways” would open a way out f
restrictive practices which were
operating to the detriment of the pul''
interest. Only defined practices wo;
be registrable, but this would not nit *
the registration of every individ ,
transaction of a registrable restrict,
practice, and no practices would be t' p
dared unlawful unless proved so ,
examination and adjudicated by i■
Tribunal as being against the put
interest. ,
In answering a question as ton:,
the Government favors registrati
when New Zealand dropped it in IS
after three years of experience of I
restrictive practices machinery, !
Snedden said that registration obvia!
the necessity for an investigating p
cedure. He abhorred the idea of havi
an investigating force, and one til
agree with him. If we are to hayelfj
restrictive practices set-up at all, fj
first test must be the discharge of oil
by registration and for the Registrar!
establish any breach. Indeed, like!
Attorney-General, one would expect '
lot of restrictive practices to disappe,
though Mr Snedden w'ould not s'
whether, in face of the impending leg
lation, any have been stopped yet. t
The Registrar, a public servant li-
the independence of a statutory authori;,]
will have the Tribunal, which
Snedden now sees as a single judi |
with, possibly, assessors to help him f 5
not to join in making decisions. j
NEW GUINEA
Pidgin Across the Border
From Suharnopura to the Sepik
FROM A SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
'lnhere has been a curious lack of news
publicity over the Pidgin language
broadcasts from Sukarnopura (until last
week Kota Baru, and formerly Hol-
landia) to the Sepik River region in the
Trust Territory and there has been no
official comment either from Port
Moresby or from Canberra where it is
said that it took the Department of
Territories a fortnight officially to in-
form the Department of External Affairs
that the broadcasts were taking place
and what they were broadcasting.
Although the broadcasts have been
harmless enough in themselves, compri-
sing village news, “sing-sing” music an.
Pidgin commentaries, they have woiwf
the Administration in New Guinea few
two reasons. One is that the contedj
and tone may easily change accordia t
to the requirements of Confrontation
The other reason is the discrepancyi
power between the transmitter 1
Wewak and the considerably n lOl
poweirful one at Sukarnopura.
To counter this, the Administrate
plans to increase the kilowattage of
Wewak station so that it can be h ea b
by all the border people, including, P‘i
sumably, the Sentani people living °l


e Indonesian side who are basically
the same culture and language and
'V in Dutch times moved backwards
d forwards across the border at will.
For a while it was thought that the
karnopura Pidgin broadcasts—which
Ve been sandwiched in between nor-
'il Malay language programmes had
;n taped in the Aitape sub-district on
i Australian side of the border and
uggled across to Sukarnopura. This is
pbably not true and would not be
Pessary in any case as tapes made
the Indonesian side of the border
:h Pidgin commentary would be read-
understood by the Sepik peoples.
Broadcasting of propaganda is still
lively new in New Guinea and the
j ministration station at Wewak, for
[tance, now broadcasts with consider-
e impact in Pidgin, English and in
ace talk” or local language. A
feature of adult education courses is to
interview people from remote villages
and to broadcast the tapes at later date
when the people have gone home.
This proves a surprisingly powerful
introduction of primitive peoples to the
use of radio.
The Administration is not only boost-
ing the kilowattage of the Wewak sta-
tion but is also installing lower-powered
stations at Daru and Kerema in the
Papuan border districts to counter radio
and other propaganda emanating from
Merauke in South-West New Guinea.
However, it is not merely a matter
of keeping a wary eye on Radio Dja-
karta or Radio Sukarnopura but also —
as the New Guinean’s literacy in Eng-
lish improves on Radio Peking which
comes in astonishingly loud and clear in
Rabaul, for instance, and in parts of
the Eastern Highlands.
UNIONS
ACTU Confronts
the Reds
And moves into foreign policy
FROM ALAN REID IN CANBERRA
ALBERT MONK
Stiffening
tE ACTU attitude towards the use of
unions by the Communist Party for
itical purposes stiffened last week,
der the guidance of ACTU President
>ert Monk, and the ACTU Interstate
xutive, Federal Officers of ACTU
ons voted 84 to 63 against a 24-hour
stralia-wide transport stoppage pro-
>al. Instead the Federal officers backed
'roposal which, if observed, would give
ACTU control over strikes. Shop
nrnittees and unions were told that
■Y must not take strike action affecting
ier unions on the penal clauses or any-
ng else without consulting the ACTU
their State Trades and Labor Councils.
The ACTU did not grasp the nettle
mpletely. It did not tell the unions, who
■re prepared to go ahead with strike
tion without consulting the ACTU and
ur State Trades and Labor Councils,
'it, if they did so, they were on their
n. But it was a step along the way
'vards ACTU recognition that many
the strikes being organised today are
n g organised outside the trade union
wement.
ACTU policy opposes penal clauses
d favors a campaign for wage in-
-'ases but it also opposes continuous
ikes on these issues. As it is, the
of positive direction by the ACTU
is producing a situation in which Com-
munist trade union leaders can tell any-
one opposing a strike that he is opposing
the ACTU.
There have been signs for some time
that the ACTU attitude has been stiffen-
ing. The ACTU even moved Right of
the ALP on foreign policy last month.
At a series of ACTU Interstate Execu-
tive meetings which started on March
16, the Queensland Trades and Labor
Council —in which Communist influence
is very strong—brought up the question
of Red China. It sponsored a resolution
that representations again be made to
the Commonwealth Government to sup-
port the recognition of mainland China.
Mr J. Riordan (Clerks’ Union) moved
an amendment which produced an inte-
resting dialogue. Mr Riordan’s amend-
ment was to add the words “on the basis
of protecting the rights of the Chinese
people of Formosa to self determina-
tion.” Mr Tom Wright, also a member
of the ACTU Interstate Executive and
a member of the Communist Party Cen-
tral Committee objected to Mr Riordan's
amendment. “That is not the policy of
the Labor Party,” he said. “The policy
of the Labor Party is recognition of Red
China without qualifications. To which
Mr Riordan replied: “My amendment
expresses what Arthur Calwell says
Labor Policy is.”
Twelve months ago a motion such as
Mr Riordan’s would not have hit the
deck. But it was carried by 10 votes to
five. Interestingly, Mr Wright’s interpre-
tation of what actually is Labor policy
on this issue is probably more accurate
than either Mr Calwell s or Mr Rior-
dan’s. If you read the minutes of the
Federal ALP Conference —Labors’ sup-
reme policy-making body—you will find
that Mr Tony Mulvihill moved a reso-
lution identical in substance with that
which the ACTU has now endorsed. It
was not accepted. When it became
obvious that it was not going to be
carried, Mr Mulvihill had to withdraw
it.
There are other signs that the ACTU
is beginning to get resentful of Left-wing
influence. An Australian-New Zealand
Peace Conference is to be held in Octo-
ber. A previous Conference received
almost unanimous ACTU backing and
was supported by an overwhelming
majority at the ACTU Congress. But this
time the Peace Conference supporters
go a resolution of support through the
ACTU Interstate Executive on a nine to
six vote and, despite the fact that it then
went on to the NSW Trades and Labor
Council as an Executive recommenda-
tion, it only survived in that body by a
125/101 vote.
FLUORIDATION
Dr Spock
Intervenes
Melbourne says No
FROM A MELBOURNE CORRESPONDENT
a time it looked as if the fluorida-
A tion of Melbourne’s water supply
might become a party political issue at
the State elections in June. All the signs
were there when a score of Melbourne’s
Municipal Councils debated the issue last
month as a prelude to a decision on the
matter by the Board of Works. All the
Councils have representatives on the 51-
man Board.
Generally speaking ALP Councillors
and Councils favored fluoridation, with
non-Labor opposing it. So in the solid
Labor belt there were Councils such as
Brunswick, Coburg, Preston, Williams-
town and Altona who instructed the
Board of Works’ representatives to sup-
port fluoridation when the question
came up on April 28. Councils in blue-
ribbon Liberal areas like Heidelberg,
Brighton and Box Hill told their dele-
gates to oppose it. Sixteen Councils
which did not discuss the matter left
their delegates free to vote as they


chose. Three days before the Board
meeting there were fourteen Councils
opposed to fluoridation and 12 support-
ing it-
During this period a Melbourne daily
published an enthusiastic article in sup-
port of fluoridation from Dr Benjamin
Spock, the American authority on the
upbringing of children whose works are
the main reference books in the homes
of countless young couples with child-
ren.
An ALP Councillor from Altona,
Mr John Ginifer, moved at the Board
meeting that the State Government be
asked to give the Board power to fluori-
date Melbourne’s water supply, adding
a further request that the Government
be asked to meet the cost of the pro-
ject. The Board rejected the proposal
by 30 votes to 19. It should have been
29 to 20, but a veteran Nunawading
Councillor, Mr C. L. Willis, confessed
afterwards that he had defied his Coun-
cil's instructions and voted against
fluoride.
The ALP policy is unmistakably in
support of fluoridation, but its Parlia-
mentary leader Mr Stoneham, mindful
of the coming election, has steered a
cautious course. After the Board’s
decision, Health Minister, Mr Mack, said
he was pleased with the outcome but
that was merely as an individual.
NSW POLITICS
The Passing
of a Premier
Well stage-managed
FROM RICHARD HALL IN SYDNEY
J. B. RENSHAW
Boy from the bush
Tt was ironical that Robert James
Heffron’s last stand on a point of
principle went virtually unnoticed in the
flurry that surrounded his resignation
last week. When the 74-year old Pre-
mier rose to his feet in the Legislative
Assembly, everyone in the House knew
what was coming. But up till that day
the secret had been well kept. The news
only began to circulate when a special
Caucus meeting had been called to hear
Mr Heffron announce his resignation
before he went into Parliament.
In a characteristically rambling little
speech he told the House that it would
be his last day as Premier. But although
he was careful to anticipate the “face-
less men” tag and counter it by saying
that no one was “throwing me out”, he
gave no reason for his resignation. In-
deed his speech deliberately avoided the
question of age. It did not contain any-
thing like the ritual formalities of “ill-
health’’ or “doctor’s advice”.
However, the resignation came after
months of speculation on when the
Premier would go. The sense of un-
easiness about going to the polls under
the leadership of Mr Heffron firmed to
conviction after the last Federal election.
But until the surprise of last week Mr
Heffron had been obstinate, going out
of his way to affirm that he did not
intend to retire and was fit, very fit.
When the question of his going had
been raised he had managed to avoid it
with a laugh. About a month ago the
rumors that he would be gone by the
June conference of the ALP became
firmer, some suggesting that the resigna-
tion announcement would come at the
conference.
The NSW Labor Cabinet keeps its
secrets well and just what had been said
to Mr Heffron in the privacy of his
office (where the Cabinet meets) did not
leak. He had seen the ALP officers
some ten days previously, and it is diffi-
cult not to believe that he was pushed.
Probably the most influential men were
not the ALP officers but Messrs \u
shaw and Hills, with the support of p
haps one or two other Cabinet Ministe
including the Attorney-General, Mr
Downing, the too often unacknc
ledged strong man of the Cabinet.
While the secret had been well lj,
there was no doubt that John Bro
Renshaw, his successor, knew,
going was well stage-managed for
election the day after the annou
ment. There was no time for op;
tion to gather. Renshaw’s only ser
opponent could have been Patrick R
Hills, Minister for Local Govern
but Hills, who is eight years your
than Mr Renshaw, did not stand. (
in the contest for the deputy-leader'
did the rivalries within the Caucus 1
veal themselves. But even there 1 j
had an easy victory over the Mir 1
for Health, the fiery Billy Sheahan,
was backed by the “outs”, genei
described as Left-wing. Sheahan
got 19 votes to Hills' 32.
Renshaw, once a butcher and a far,
before coming into Parliament in l!
is an affable, easy-going man whose
ner can sometimes hide a shrewi
and grasp of facts that have made
a respected administrator. Unlike o
Ministers in the NSW State Cabinet
is not an exponent of the “no-staterci
technique. He handles his Press
tions well, a rare virtue in Labor M
cians.
Young, for a Premier, at 54,■
raven black hair, Renshaw’s election
moves age as an issue against Labfl
the next election. As a rural men
who knows the country, the new i
mier will be a potent factor in holt
ground for Labor in the vital com
electorates.
At present Labor’s majority in]
assembly is 14, gained in the post-crj
squeeze bitterness. After Noven:;
opposition hopes were running fr|
Now they are less sure.
CONSUMERS
Panning the Packets
A slur on Coca-Cola?
FROM D. MCDOUGALL IN MELBOURNE
report on Australian packaging
practices, tabled in the Victorian
Parliament last week, would not have
caused such a stir if its 2322 pages had
not chosen to name several companies
whose products were considered to be
deceptively packaged. Naturally the
firms reacted violently to the “slur”
which Mr W. J. Cuthill, SM, had placed
on their names.
For instance, the Coca-Cola people
brought on a great flood of facts to
counteract his criticisms of tl>
“waisted” bottle and it must be admin
that they managed to justify themsek
But they were lost for an accepts
answer to the SM’s point about
deceptive advertisement. This depict
glass of coke, next to the bottle fn.
which it was poured, as having the sa
level of liquid as that left in the hot
the only trouble being that the glass'
half full of ice.
The Unilever group was also hau.


>r the coals. A spokesman pointed out
t Lux soap flakes only half filled
ir packet at the factory (where Mr
hill had seen them) because, at that
j, e they were compressed—before long
L expanded to a “normal” level, he
med. In replying to the criticism
[I Deb Instant Mash Potato Packets
Itained only a “small pouch” of the
duct, the spokesman said this pouch
only a quarter inch shorter and a
■ inch narrower than the carton. Un-
liunately, he neglected to compare the
pkness of the two.
')f course all this argument was rather
centre to the theme of the whole
ort which, incidentally, covered every-
ig from cement to semen. Mr Cuthill
located general standardisation of
zhts and their type size on the
•kage—the simpler the regulations the
her they would be to enforce.
This would either eliminate or at least
e some meaning to words such as
per”, “giant”, “family” and “king”
sizes. Moerover, it would help wipe out
the confusion facing the housewife. One
morning paper quoted the typically
ridiculous position at most supermarkets
where she is faced with a choice of three
detergents—one costs 3s. Id. for 20 ozs,
another 3s. 7d. for 26 ozs and the other
4s. 4+d. for 33 ozs!
The essential problems facing these
proposals is that our Constitution pre-
vents the Federal Government from
doing anything worthwhile by itself,
Control must be national, but it won’t
be unless the Commonwealth and States
can agree on some foolproof scheme. A
meeting of the Ministers will be held
later this year in an attempt to arrive
at such an arrangement. It could take
a year or longer to “spring the snares”
set for housewives, to use Sir Herbert
Hyland’s terminology. Once initial
agreement prevails, more time will
lapse while the States draw up and
introduce their six separate sets of
uniform legislation.
UNIVERSITIES
Behind the
Stay-in Strike
Too little for Lodewycks ’ library
FROM A MELBOURNE CORRESPONDENT
SIR G. PATON
Somewhat meagre
n the night every seat in the Baillieu
Library at Melbourne University was
ed. That is nothing unusual for the
illieu, but as closing time drew near
>re students started pouring in. By 10
n. the spacious foyer was packed with
er 600 of them and the speeches
irted. When the talking was over most
int home, but over two hundred re-
ained in the library to work at their
>oks and notes through the night. The
ft ts burned in the library until dawn
id this was the students’ simple and
fective way of drawing attention to the
irlous condition of their library.
The Baillieu is like a handsome packet
mcealing short-weight and adulteration.
u *lt at a cost of £700,000 and opened
1959, it is one of the show-pieces of
Melbourne University. It is in good
°dern style, well-planned and with
steful decor and air conditioning. It
|Egests efficiency applied to the pursuit
learning, but as a functioning uni-
1 -rsity library the Baillieu has reached
taking point.
I B cannot hold anything like the
amber of students who need to use
|L B misses by 1500 seats and the floor
space that this implies. It offers the
sight of students, unable to get a seat and
desk, sitting on the floor to do their
work: some rest their backs against the
wall, others against the bookstacks. A
student who leaves his place to go for
a book, risks losing his seat. To control
this ‘'claim - jumping the librarians
provide yellow paper slips. To reserve
his place, a student signs his name and
fills in the exact moment of his de-
parture. Placed on his books, the slip
reserves his place for a maximum of
twenty minutes. After that, one of the
floor-squatters may appropriate it.
Recently the University Council threw
open its big Wilson Hall to students who
had no other place where they could sit
down to study. This is a help to those
working from their own books or notes,
but not to the hundreds who need the
books in the Baillieu.
The Baillieu not only needs capital
for extensions it needs much bigger
revenue even to function on its present
scale. It has overspent by £22,000 this
year and it has now been forbidden to
purchase any book costing more than
£5, or to take out subscriptions to new
periodicals. In addition it cannot buy
more than one copy of any particular
book. The effect of this veto on multiple
purchases can be imagined when it is
realised that in some First Year Arts
subjects there may be as many as 400
or 500 students who need to use a par-
ticular book.
Lecturers are appalled at the implica-
tions of the multiple-purchase ban. In
some First Year subjects, students are
given a choice of up to five topics for
essays. Assuming the best situation
where they distribute themselves evenly
among the topics, this can still produce
a situation where about a hundred
students need to work for prolonged
periods with a book of which only one
copy is available —two if the Victorian
Public Library happens to have stocked
it. Staff members also complain that
there have been delays of a year between
publication of overseas books and The
volumes appearing on the Baillieu
shelves.
On top of this, Melbourne University
has several new departments for which
the Baillieu has yet to build up adequate
collections. For Chinese, Japanese and
Indian studies entirely new sub-libraries
need to be built up from scratch.
When the Baillieu has met its expenses
for periodicals, binding, stationery and
other items, it had £BOOO left for books
in 1964. It got by in the previous year
by running up a deficit of £35,000, but
the University authorities under the Vice
Chancellor, Sir George Paton, are deter-
mined that this will not happen again.
Hence the present restrictions on its
book buying.
Its total budget for 1964 is £75,000 —■
exactly the same sum as the much smaller
University of WA spends on its library
and a little over half of what Sydney
University allocates. The Baillieu’s share
of Melbourne University’s revenue this
year is 3.7 per cent. The average among
all Australian universities is 5 per cent.
The suggestion that the Baillieu should
get £120,000 a year is a modest claim—
Sydney University library got £135,000
this year with a student population not
very much greater than Melbourne’s
13,000.
On July 31 last, Sydney had 815,975
volumes and the Baillieu 347,880.
During the year Sydney added 54,953
books but Baillieu’s accessions of 24,842
were fewer than those of Queensland
(34,093) and Adelaide (27,634) both of
which are much smaller universities.
NSW with 36,615 and the ANU with
31,080 both bought more books than
Melbourne. So did Monash, but it is
still at the stage where the basic library
is being amassed.
The Baillieu also lagged in staffing.
It had only 34 people with graduate or
librarianship qualifications compared


with 76 at Sydney and 42 at NSW. Its
staff has only risen by one during the
year, despite a growing volume of work.
In keeping the library open 74 hours
a week they were doing a great job —-
only Sydney with 83 hours did better.
One of the strangest features of the
Baillieu crisis is the way in which it
has been squeezed within the general
framework of tightness of Melbourne
University finance. It has never been
given as big a slice of the cake as other
Australian universities have given to their
libraries: and each year its share of the
cake has diminished —from 4.4 per cent
in 1962 to 3.7 per cent this year. The
Bulletin asked its librarian, Mr K. A.
Lodewycks, if he saw it this way. He
certainly did: “It would seem that this
university provides far less support for
its library than any other university.”
What did Mr Lodewycks and his staff
do while the stayput students worked
through the night? They could have
ended it all by turning a few switches

didn't. Some librarians remained behind,
going about their usual duties. When
the protest meeting in the foyer ended,
Mr Lodewycks was at hand, calmly
answering reporters’ questions and
supplying data and figures. The three
policemen who turned up as the demon-
stration started were superfluous, but
not Mr Lodewycks.
LIQUOR
What Every Victorian Knows
The Commissioner’s tentative conclusions
FROM A MELBOURNE CORRESPONDENT
six months’ work behind him,
** Victoria's Royal Commissioner in-
to the liquor laws, Mr P. D. Phillips
QC, took a month's breather last week.
Before doing so he announced a series
of tentative conclusions. These were
matters for which the evidence was not
contradicted, Mr Phillips said. They
included the proposition that neither
hotel trading hours nor the number of
retail outlets made much difference to
the amount of liquor consumed in the
community. Disposable income was the
determining factor. Mr Phillips also
stated what every Victorian already
knew that six o’clock closing in
country areas was not, and could not
be, enforced.
Mr Phillips not only left Victorians
with these sane points to reflect on, but
he also left the State's temperance forces
in a state of some disarray. The trouble
started a week earlier when the Rev.
John Westerman, representing seven
Church groups at the Inquiry, told Mr
Phillips that five of the group
abandoned opposition to extensio:
hotel bar hours beyond 6 p.m.
Mr Westerman said that he had:
compelled to arrive at the conch
that there was no significant correl;
between hours of hotel trading and
sociological consequences of drill
“This conclusion has not been art
at easily or lightly and it will here
nised that this represents a com;
departure from what has been a fa
mental belief of many people fora:
long time,’' he said. The groups?:
had changed their view were in
Anglican, Presbyterian, Methodist,!
tist and Congregational churches,
therefore wish to move from a pos
of advocacy of 6 o’clock closing
position of neutrality.”
Mr Westerman's announcement
presents the greatest sensation on
liquor question that Victoria has
in 50 years. Victoria introduced 6
closing as a “temporary” measured:
the 1914-18 war.
Mr Westerman represented the it

FRENCH CONVICTS, AUSTRALIAN JINGOS
J&uiLetCn
80 Years Ago: May 10, 1884
A ustralia for the Australians, as a
political expression is healthy
and patriotic, so long as it covers no
more than the idea that in their own
continent Australians are in duty
bound, if need be, to die to maintain
the doctrine that no foreign power
possesses any right whatsoever to
interfere in their affairs. To say this
would not be to advocate and preach
anything resembling “spread-
eagleism.” Yet Australia as represen-
ted by the insane jingos, clamors for
the wholesale annexation of the Poly-
nesian Archipelago.
Let it be granted that it would be
most objectionable to have this conti-
nent inundated with French recidi-
vists (from Polynesia). Had the
economic mistake of convict trans-
portation been logically and courte-
ously pointed out to the French
Government, we firmly believe that
France would have been disposed to
listen —to reason. But, no! either a
tone of ridiculous bluster, or one of
impertinent advice (such as MUR-
RAY SMITH'S cool suggestion to
shunt all the recidivists off to
Cayenne, and so save Australian, at
the expense of American and West
Indian, morals) has been adopted,
leaving to France scarce any option
but to continue in her course.
The task set to Australians is to
colonise Australia—a task of surpas-
sing magnitude and dignity; one, also,
that demands untiring exertion and
exclusive devotion.
One day last week there was a large
" meeting of the unemployed at
the Hyde Park gates, and while one
of the speakers was giving a very
graphic, if rather gruesome, descrip-
tion of starvation (which he said was
staring his hearers in the face), a
man drove up in a buggy and offered
as many men as chose to take it
work at five shillings a day—which
they unanimously refused. Now, five
shillings a day is not princely pay,
but the men who refused it must be
fond either of starving or of lying.
And we don’t think they are fond of
starving.


OVERSEAS
Macapagal of the Philippines
A conflict of interests...
FROM ALEX JOSEY IN SINGAPORE
Named after King Philip of Spain,
the 18-year old Republic of the
Philippines is the only Christian
State in Asia. Ninety-three per cent of
the 30 million Lilipinos, most of them
Malays, are Christians: 83 per cent are
Catholic. Diosdado Macapagal, 54-year-
old President of the Philippines, is a
Catholic.
He is an honest man. In his inaugu-
ral speech in 1962, President Macapagal
declared: “Our first mission is the solu-
tion of the problem of corruption. We
assume leadership at a time when our
nation is in the throes of a moral
degeneration unprecedented in our
national history. Never within the span
of human memory has graft permeated
every level of government.” He pro-
mised to eradicate corruption. Today,
President Macapagal is still trying to
smash a gigantic cigarette-smuggling
racket that cheats the Treasury of more
than a hundred million dollars a year.
Born in the village of Lubao, in the
province of Pampanga, where, say. the
Filipos, “all men are lazy and treacher-
ous”, in a palm-frond hut, on Septem-
ber 28, 1910, young Diosdado Macapagal
was welcomed as a gift from Heaven.
Diosdado means God-given in Spanish.
His father was a jobless poet who wrote
prose in Tagalog, a native dialect, now
the national language. His mother kept
pigs and took in lodgers. Macapagal
grew up in abject poverty. During the
day he attended the village school,
worked in the fields and looked after
water buffaloes. At night, he would go
into the rice-fields to catch frogs for
food.
He was a bright boy. He finished
top of his class at the village school,
second at the high school. He went to
the University, his fees being paid by
a philanthropist, and worked part-time
in the Bureau of Lands as a clerk. In
1936, he finished first in the Bar exa-
minations: the following year he became
an assistant attorney in a private law
firm.
Macapagal was 32, a professor at the
College of Law, and, briefly, a legal
assistant to President Quezon, when the
Japanese struck at Pearl Harbor in
December, 1941. Macapagal joined the
anti-Japanese underground and became
an intelligence agent. After the war he
returned to the law college.
In 1946, he joined the legal division
of the Department of Loreign Affairs,
and thus became involved with govern-
ment at the centre. This was an impor-
tant year for Macapagal, perhaps the
most important in his life. This was the
year he married Evangelina Macaraeg, a
physician and a former beauty queen.
Mrs Macapagal is a highly intelligent
and resourceful woman. Macapagal’s
first wife died during the Japanese occu-
pation. They had two children.
In the Philippines, women play an im-
portant part in men’s lives. In many
ways, upon the choice of his life's part-
ner might a young man’s whole future
depend. In the Philippines a wife is
normally an equal partner: sometimes,
cleverly, she can be both the dutiful,
loving wife and a leading partner.
Filipinas, as the women are called, en-
joy a respect and independence rare
among Asian women. They are soft,
charming, intelligent and notoriously
jealous. One has only to see Mr and
Mrs Macapagal together, at a State
function, relaxed at an informal gather-
ing, to realise that the fifth President of
the Republic of the Philippines is wed-
ded to a loyal and attentive woman of
character and talent. They have two
children.
In 1948 Macapagal, now chief of the
legal division at the Foreign Office, suc-
cessfully negotiated with Great Britain
the return of the Turtle Islands to the
Philippines. Then he went to Washing-
ton as Second Secretary in the Philip-
pine Embassy, returning to take charge
of the legal side of treaties the follow-
ing year.
Macapagal probably never knew it,
but this legalistic defeat he inflicted on
a former Great Power, which restored
the Turtle Islands to the Philippines,
considerably influenced his future
career. He may, in this way, have
taken his first step towards the Presi-
dency. For it was about that time that

he became involved with the claim of
certain Filipos to parts of North Borneo,
then a British possession. These indi-
viduals demanded money. Certain
moneys had been paid by Britain in the
past, but this had stopped for proper
reasons. Nobody wanted land, they
wanted hard cash, “a tribute, rent”. No
part of North Borneo has ever been
part of the Philippines. Nevertheless,
Macapagal the lawyer became deeply
concerned with this claim, to such an
extent, friends say, that when Malaysia
was created in September, 1963, his
judgment as President failed him en-
tirely. In consequence, the Philippines
refused to recognise Malaysia, mainly
on the grounds that what Macapagal
was now calling “the Philippines’ claim
o Sabah” had not been settled.
Malaysia—who wants what?
“What d° the Philippines claim?” ask-
ed Tunku Abdul Rahman, Prime
Minister of Malaysia. “Do they want
all of Sabah? Or just a bit of it? Or
,do they want money instead? I have
[never seen their claim.” Understand-
ably. No formal claim has ever been
made. Always the genial Tunku has
been prepared to consider negotiations:
[but to negotiate what?
Instead of accepting Malaysia, and
then making his claim, President Maca-
pagal diplomatically denied the exist-
ence of Malaysia, a member of the
Commonwealth and of the United
Nations, and associated with President
Soekarno’s infamous aggression against
Malaysia, which threatens no one, which
wants to live with all her neighbors
peacefully and neighborly. At no time
has President Macapagal denounced
Indonesia’s infiltration into Malaysian
territory.
In the Philippines, in spite of Maca-
pagal s efforts to whip up nationalistic
tervor over his Sabah claim, his un-
friendly attitude towards Malaysia has
embarrassed and angered many promi-
nent and sensible Filipinos. They can-
not understand this reaction to a new
State which is largely Malay, definitely
anti-Communist, and most desirous to
be friends. Welcomed by Sir Garfield
Barwick on behalf of Australia as “a
significant contribution to the solidarity
of the region”, Malaysia has been des-
cribed by Mr Dean Rusk, United States
Secretary of State, as “a positive and
progressive development in South-east
Asia ’. In Singapore, early in April, a
delegation of Afro-Asian trade unionists
declared their full support for Malaysia,
dismissed as groundless Soekarno’s
charge that Malaysia is neo-colonialism.
India and Egypt have welcomed Malay-
>ia, among many other Afro-Asian
countries.
What most fair-minded people under-
stand is that Malaysia was created
through the free will of the people of
Sarawak, Sabah, Singapore and Malaya.
They decided, willingly, to form Malay-
sia, just as, willingly, Brunei decided not
to join the new State. U Thant, Secre-
tary-General of the United Nations, was
requested by Indonesia, the Philippines
and Malaya to find out if the people in
Sabah and Sarawak genuinely wanted
to become part of Malaysia. He sent
a team of investigators, one of whom
was Polish. U Thant satisfied himself
that the will of the people had been
ascertained. His report confirmed Bri-
tish contentions that democracy had in-
deed been in action in the Borneo
territories.
Macapagal refused to accept the re-
port, as did Soekarno. To the astonish-
ment of his foreign friends, with whom
he is linked in the United Nations, and
in the South-east Asia Treaty Organisa-
tion, Macapagal continued to associate
himself with President Soekarno’s op-
position to Malaysia. This was puzzling
because the two men are dissimilar in
personality and basic policy. President
Soekarno, lifetime Great Leader of
Indonesia, rules by personal decree,
having abolished democracy in all forms
of life in Indonesia. Under his leader-
ship a hundred million Indonesians have
been led to the brink of economic
chaos and financial collapse. Today,
an army of 440,000 Indonesians, a
powerful air force and a Russian-sup-
plied navy, face Malaysia, which has an
army far fewer than 10,000, few aircraft
and fewer naval vessels. President
Macapagal is aware of all these facts.
Even so, he joins in the applause when
President Soekarno, with a scowl on his
heavy face, threateningly demands an
Asian solution to an Asian problem, a
proposition which Prince Sihanouk hur-
riedly rejects, though close and friendly
with Soekarno, when - suggestions are
made that this theory be applied to
Cambodia’s border problems with South
Vietnam and Thailand.
In siding with Soekarno against
Malaysia, did Macapagal forget the
American bases in the Philippines, bases
which bring considerable revenue to the
Philippines’ economy, which are largely
responsible for the national defence of
the Philippines?
What has brought about this curious
situation? Why does the Catholic head
of a Christian democratic State prefer
the friendship of a notorious demagogue
who has contemptuously spurned demo-
cracy, whose personal threats to crush
and chew Malaysia are an international
scandal, to the genuine friendship of a
new democratic creation which is ready
to experiment with democracy, wishes
harm to no country, is eager to be
friends with all neighbors, and is also
prepared to join in a common struggle
to help each other free themselves from
the need for foreign military and econo-
mic assistance? Why?
Public pressure is mounting in
Manila where more and more perplexed
persons, worried about Soekarno’s wan-
ton and bare-faced aggression, so
reminiscent of past European dictators,
are demanding an answer to what one
writer has called “Macapagal's monu-
mental display of illogicality”.
In a public speech in Manila on
April 7, Senator Lorenzo Sumulong,
Chairman of the Senate Committee on
Foreign Affairs, publicly charged Pre-
sident Macapagal with being clearly
biased against Malaysia. He said Pre-
sident Macapagal seemed to believe
President Soekarno’s allegation that
Malaysia is a British neo-colonialist plot
to encircle Indonesia.
He said President Macapagal had
shown strange passivity and indifference
in the face of threats of war by Pre-
sident Soekarno. The Philippines’ Pre-
sident, he added, did not seem alarmed
when Indonesians sacked the British and
Malaysian embassies in Djakarta, by the
seizure and confiscation of British com-
panies by Indonesian workers, nor by
infiltration into North Borneo and Sara-
wak by Indonesian regular troops and
guerrillas. Indeed, President Macapagal
appeared to be sympathetic to President
Soekarno’s excuses for his warlike acts.
Sabah—a phony claim?
Sumulong went on to say
that President Macapagal ignored the
fact that if Malaysia were really a plot
to perpetuate British colonialism over
North Borneo, Sarawak and Singapore,
the people of these former British ter-
ritories should be “complaining and
crying and shouting loud against Malay-
sia”, rather than President Soekarno.
On the contrary, the people welcomed
Malaysia and bitterly opposed President
Soekarno’s efforts to crush the new
State.
Senator Sumulong said that President
Macapagal paid no heed to Tunku
Abdul Rahman’s appeals that in resist-
ing Indonesian infiltration Malaysia is
doing no more than acting in self-
defence. In entering into a defence


pact with Britain, Malaysia is doing no
more than what the Philippines did
when they made a defence pact with
the United States.
Instead of helping the people of
Indonesia and Malaysia promote social
progress and better standards of life,
President Macapagal remained passive
and indifferent to President Soekarno’s
confrontation policy against Malaysia.
This policy had the effect of further
impoverishing the masses of Indonesia,
and also of Malaysia, because of the
burden of defence.
President MacapagaFs reply was that
his policy effectively served the national
interests, including the Philippines’ claim
to Sabah. He did not explain how.
The President said that this policy had
provided a hope for the ultimate settle-
ment of Malaysian-Indonesian relations,
and it has “so far contributed to the
prevention of widespread hostilities be-
tween Malaysia and Indonesia”. Again,
Macapagal did not attempt to justify this
remarkable assertion.
What sort of man is Macapagal?
What is there in him which permits him
to risk the prestige and well-being of
his nation in a hardly creditable attempt
to win a few paltry millions, which
dubious Filipinos claim as rent for
parts of Sabah they say is theirs, but
which the people of Sabah indignantly
and vigorously deny?
This never started as a national
claim. In Manila, in 1963, I met law-
yers and hosts of descendants from
rival sultans all of whom claimed to be
the rightful owners, many years ago, of
areas in Sabah. Each accused the
others of being impostors. Certain
claimants formed themselves into a cor-
poration which, in advance of any settle-
ment, sold timber rights in the land they
claimed to be theirs to speculators con-
vinced they would make huge profits
from their investments. These are the
sort of people with vested interests in
the Philippines’ claim to Sabah. Presi-
dent Macapagal elevated these sordid
dealings, which I exposed in the “Straits
Times” on January 18, 1963, to the
status of a national issue.
When dollars are at stake?
‘ll/hy did President Macapagal pursue
" this matter to such an extent that
he became associated with President
Soekarno in endangering the peace of
South-East Asia? Through his encour-
agement, by his display of unfriendli-
ness towards Malaysia, Macapagal in
effect influenced Soekarno, already
adopting a warlike posture towards
Malaysia. Why did Macapagal do this
when only dollars, not national integrity,
were really at stake?
We must delve deeply for the answers
to these questions.
In Manila, last year, I interviewed
Nicasio Osmena, lawyer for some of
the claimants. He authorised me to tell
Tunku Abdul Rahman that his claim on
Sabah could easily be settled by pay-
ment of a few million dollars. Osmena
said nobody in the Philippines wanted
bits of Sabah: they wanted hard cash.
With astonishing frankness, Osmena
argued that it would be cheaper for the
Tunku to buy him off than to allow
the issue to develop into a national
cause. Osmena assured me that “the
politicians are in this and they will cause
trouble if this is not settled sensibly”.
By which, he made clear to me, the
payment of a large sum of money would
be considered settlement. He added
that politicians in “very high places”
were involved.
Nicasio Osmena also told me that he
and his friends financed the Azahari
revolt in Brunei. He said he would
stop this revolt if the Tunku was ready
to settle his claim on Sabah.
All this substantiates the argument
that the national honor and integrity
of the Philippines was never involved
in this affair: just dollars, in an improb-
able legal claim. For this, Macapagal
is gambling with peace and security in
South-east Asia. By associating with
Soekarno’s anti-Malaysia policy, Maca-
pagal did nothing to restrain Soekarno's
belligerency while being fully aware
that Soekarno is the good friend of
Chairman Mao Tse-tung, the friend of
Chairman Khrushchev, and the fierce
critic of the West upon whom, in the
final analysis, the Philippines continues
to depend for defence. In effect, what
Macapagal was doing was to say to the
West: ‘‘Settle my claim: pay up, and
I will recognise Malaysia”. Malaysians
felt justified in asking themselves at
what point does ruthless pressure, harm-
ful to a good cause, of a claim for
money become moral blackmail?
For this, they believed, was what
MacapagaFs attitude amounted to.
How did Macapagal, a brilliant man,
an honest man, get enmeshed in this
entanglement of contradictions? There
is no simple answer. Probably there are
many contributing explanations for
MacapagaFs behavior and in examining
these we might, perhaps, find Diosdad;
Macapagal the man. Understandably,;
a professor of law, the Sabah claim n®
have appeared to him as a fascinatin'
legal puzzle, deeply absorbing, mayb
to the point of obsession. This coul
explain a distorted judgment. On tl
other hand, Macapagal could be i
astute politician seeking another Tun'
Island success, a politician dragged \
circumstances into an untenable situ:
tion from which he can discover t
compromise solution.
A million-dollar election
TTis enemies, and he has many i
Manila, cynically point out that
successful Presidential election in tl
Philippines costs a million dollars. The
say that MacapagaFs election backei
are among the speculators heavily invol
ved in the Sabah claims, and that Mac:
pagal, believing in the validity of tl
claims, is fully committed politically t
guard their investments.
MacapagaFs friends deny this, the
point to his record of incorruptibility
They ask: Could this man be involve:
in any way in an Osmena scheme t(
blackmail Malaysia?
When all the conjectures, allegation
and guesses have been scrutinised, w
must not overlook another possible con
tributory explanation of Macapagal
attitude of opposition and resentmeff
tdwards Malaysia. Diosdado is a religi-
ous man. He is the Head of a Christiar
State. He is also an Asian, a nationalis-
tic Asian. He is a Filipino, and Presi-
dent of a State wherein can be found
traces of Malayan, Indonesian, Chinese.
Spanish and American cultures. Today,
the English language in the Philippine
is dominant. Here is a republic
modelled on American lines. But, here,
too, is a Filipino nationalism, intense,
vibrant, and essentially Asian. Ate
three centuries and more of Western
influences, the Filipinos have discovered
that they are Asians whose future is
bound closely with their neighbors.
Thus Macapagal can share many of the
extravagant hopes and beliefs of Soe-
karno, an Asian determined to smash
Western influences in Asia.
Does all this mean that Macapagal
the intense Asian nationalist, dreanis d
extending the rule of the Filipinos in to
Sabah? Is he really interested in land :
and not dollars?
This thought must not be dismissed
out of hand. Let us look at the record.
On June 27, 1962, President Macapagal
unenamored of the prospect of 3
Malaysia, proposed a Greater Malayan
Confederation. This would include the
Philippines, Malaya, Singapore and the
Borneo territories. There would be no
need for Malaysia. This proposal foun
no favorable reaction in Kuala Lum
pur or Singapore.

In December, 1962, Sheikh Azahari
launched his short-lived revolt against
the Sultan of Brunei. This was to be
the signal for an uprising throughout
Borneo against the creation of Malay-
sia. Popular support for the uprising
failed to materialise anywhere: Azahari
found no support from anyone except
from his friends in Djakarta and
Manila. Azahari was in Manila when his
men tried to force the Sultan to declare
Azahari his Prime Minister. Most of
the time Azahari spent in Manila’s night
clubs: they have day clubs, too, in
Manila.
While Azahari was still living, at
Osmena’s expense, in Manila, in luxury
befitting the “Prime Minister of Kali-
mantan Utara”, protected by Manila
police against British and Malaysian
spies and worse, President Macapagal,
in January, 1963, gave his State of the
Nation Address to Congress. He spoke
of “the Philippine claim of sovereignty,
jurisdiction, and proprietory ownership,
over North Borneo as successor-in-
interest of the Sultan of Sulu”. He told
Congress he had personally studied this
claim over a period of years. When
he was serving in Washington he dis-
cussed it with an expert in Anglo-Saxon
law “who sustained the view that it was
a valid claim”. Macapagal recalled
that in 1950 he successfully authored
and sponsored a resolution for the filing
of this claim. He said that upon becom-
ing President, “acting on the conviction
that this was not only a valid claim but
that its presentation was demanded by
national interest, it became our inescap-
able duty to act on that resolution”.
Here could be the words of a man
at last in a powerful position to take
positive action on something he has
been longing to do for years; a hobby-
ist whose obsession clouds his judgment
and allows him to equate a quaint legal
puzzle with national interests.
Soekarno’s Maphilindo
President Macapagal told Congress
that the Philippines had an historic
and valid claim to North Borneo. “In
addition,” he argued, “the pursuit of
the claim is itself vital to our national
security.” Macapagal insisted that
Malaya had no valid claim or right to
take over North Borneo. “Further-
more, if through arbitrary arrangement,
the Borneo territory is placed under
Malaya, Malaya could not ensure foi
long the security of North Borneo for
the free world.”
In Malaysia this was interpreted as
a plea for support to the United States.
Nobody had ever suggested there would
be “an arbitrary arrangement” for
Malaya to take over North Borneo.
Elections were to be held.
Macapagal finished up by saying that,
“in laying claim to North Borneo in
pursuance of the legal and historic rights
and the security interest of the Philip-
pines, we recognise the cardinal prin-
ciple of self-determination”. He asked
that the will of the people concerned
be ascertained, preferably supervised by
the United Nations. Britain and
Malaya at once agreed. In due course,
U Thant, Secretary-General of the Uni-
ted Nations, sent an investigatory team
to Borneo to find out if the majority
of the people wanted to become part
of Malaya. U Thant reported that they
did. President Macapagal refused to
accept the report.
Before the United Nations team went
to Borneo, on June 7, 1963, the
Foreign Ministers of Malaysia, Indo-
nesia and the Philippines met in Manila.
That day the President of the Philip-
pines produced the Macapagal Plan,
which later President Soekarno, a most
experienced and efficient slogan-maker,
called Maphilindo. This was to be a
federation of “nations of Malay origin”,
meaning Malaysia, the Philippines and
Indonesia. Foreign Minister Tun
Abdul Razak of Malaysia welcomed the
Plan in principle because it envisaged
“the grouping of the three nations of
Malay origin working together in
closest harmony, but without surrender-
ing any portion of their sovereignty”.
When, the following month, President
Macapagal welcomed President Soe-
karno and Tunku Abdul Rahman to
Manila, the two Presidents promised to
welcome and recognise Malaysia, pro-
vided they were satisfied that Malaysia
was what the people of Borneo wanted.
The Philippines reserved its position re-
garding the claim to Sabah. Macapagal
the lawyer agreed that the inclusion of
North Borneo into Malaysia would not
prejudice the claim. This remarkable
concession, bearing in mind Macapa-
gal’s earlier insistence that Sabah was
part of the Philippines, convinced
Malaysian experts that all that the
Philippines really wanted was not Sabah
but a hard cash settlement. They
wanted to be bought off, otherwise there
would be trouble. In spite of the Ma-
nila Agreement, this still appeared to
be Macapagal’s attitude.
For, as all the world now knows,
both Indonesia and the Philippines, for
different reasons, the Philippines because
Malaysia had made no offer over the
Sabah claim, and Indonesia because
Soekarno has no intention of recogni-
sing Malaysia nor of abandoning his
policy of domination, failed to honor
their word. The Philippines remained
silent. Indonesia invaded Borneo ter-
ritory, sent trained saboteurs into Singa-
pore with orders to attack vital instal-
lations. Peace in Asia, already peri-
lously poised in Laos and Vietnam,
trembled and tottered.
On being anti-Chinese
At the SEATO Ministerial Conference
in April, 1964, Australia, Britain
and the United States made clear their
intention to defend Malaysia if attack-
ed. Sir Robert Menzies' statement on
January 16 had already clarified Aus-
tralia’s position. This said that Aus-
tralia ‘‘has in particular made its posi-
tion abundantly clear to the Indonesian
Government, emphasising that although
we sincerely desire friendly relations
with Indonesia, which we regard as
important for both countries, we also
stand firmly for the political and terri-
torial integrity of Malaysia and have
given definite military undertakings in
support of it. We have informed Indo-
nesia that we disapprove of Indonesia’s
refusal to recognise Malaysia and its
threat to crush Malaysia . . Sir
Robert added that his statement of
September 25, 1963, that Australia
“would assist Malaysian and British
forces to defend Malaysia against ex-
ternal attack or externally inspired
subversion*’ remains unaltered.
While President Macapagal was pre-
paring to speak at this SEATO Confer-
ence, Vice-President Pelaez, with whom
the President has quarrelled, accused
Macapagal of pursuing a policy which
“lacked direction” and “increased the
danger of war in the area*’, by failing
to honor promises to recognise Malay-
sia. Pelaez said that in the eyes of the
people of Sabah, the Philippines now
appeared as would-be colonisers. He
branded the presence of Indonesian
guerrillas in Malaysia as “bare-faced
aggression”. This is a truth President
Macapagal has never uttered. Pelaez
demanded that Indonesian guerrillas
withdraw to Indonesia. Again, this is
something President Macapagal has
never said. Pelaez urged Macapagal to
adopt a forthright position on the
Malaysia question “before it is too
late”.
Neither President Macapagal nor his
Foreign Minister could satisfactorily
reply to these remarks.

More than a Scotch, a Tradition for over jqo years.
there is belief that President Macapagal
is anti-Chinese, and that this, as well as
his obsession over an absorbing legal
question, is responsible for his un-
friendly attitude towards Malaysia.
Nearly half the population of Malay-
sia is Chinese. Maphilindo emphasised
unity of the three States of “Malay ori-
gin” on racial grounds, and uneasiness
was expressed by the Chinese in Malay-
sia. They remembered the history of
the Chinese in this region; they recalled
how savagely President Soekarno treated
the Chinese in Indonesia, and they were
aware that President Macapagal had
arbitrarily deported more than 100 Fili-
pinos of Chinese origin, some of them
millionaires, soon after taking office, on
the grounds that they were engaged in
fraudulent business practices, or had
obtained citizenship through trickery,
There are perhaps half a million
Chinese in the Philippines, 52 per cent
of them born in the country, and they
are said to own about a quarter of the
nation’s capital investments, which in
itself is an irritant to Filipino national-
ists. The Chinese are no newcomers to
the Philippines. Long before the Span-
ish came to the Philippines in the 16th
century, merchants from China were
trading with the islands. The Philip-
pines is less than 350 miles from China,
a geographical fact of some concern to
Filipino defence chiefs in these jet and
missile days. Trade with the Philippines
began as early as the 10th century, dur-
ing the Tang period, and reached a
climax in the 15th century, during the
reign of the early Ming emperors.
Emperor Yung Lo even sent a governor
to Luzon, but the Chinese never gained
political control of the island. There,
as in other parts of South-East Asia,
they have always been more concerned
with trade than politics.
The Chinese massacre
Jn 1521, when that remarkable Portu-
guese - turned - Spaniard Ferdinand
Magellan raised the Spanish flag on
Cebu, one of the 7107 islands (4300 of
them nameless, less than a thousand
of them inhabited, only 463 of them
larger than one square mile) which
make up the Philippine Archipelago,
the largest in the world, Chinese
settlers had been living in Manila,
on the west coast of the island
of Luzon, for many years. Magellan,
one of the greatest navigators in history,
was 41 when he discovered the Philip-
pines. He was killed in a battle on the
small island of Mactan within a month.
Early Chinese settlers were as thrifty
as the modern Chinese, and soon they
began to monopolise the country’s
economy. They were treated badly by
the Spanish. They were heavily taxed
and forced to live outside the city. In-
evitably, the Chinese resisted. In 1603
they revolted and 20,000 were mass-
acred. In 1662, when a famed Chinese
pirate, Koxinga, conqueror of Taiwan,
demanded tribute from the Spanish in
the Philippines, a worried Governor
tried to expel all the Chinese residents.
Again they rebelled, and again they were
crushed. Thousands more Chinese were
killed in two later revolts, in 1686 and in
1762.
But the Chinese are a hardy and in-
dustrious race, and they survived both
the Spanish occupation and the Ameri-
can occupation which was to follow.
Today they still retain an important
influence on the nation’s economy, in
spite of the nationalistic, pro-Filipino
legislation understandably passed by
Congress when, under President Quezon,
the Filipinos struggled to assert their
nationalism.

OUT AND ABOUT
Everyone’s Dear Enemy
“ I never believe a man who looks me straight in the eyes
all the time ”
By HUGH CURNOW
The accent couldn’t be less Oxford,
the words more succinct. “When
I die”, Cassandra of the London
“Daily Mirror” told me during his recent
visit to Brisbane, “there’s just one epi-
taph I want on my gravestone I WAS
THERE”. And indeed he was. Six wars,
by his own count, have felt the impact
of William Neil Connor’s pen and pres-
ence. So, too, have the Eichmann trial,
the Ruby trial, the White House, the
Vatican, the Berlin wall and just about
any place, person or event of major im-
portance in the past generation. And
then, don’t forget, there are the hearts
of millions of “Mirror” readers who
worship “Cass” with the special devotion
a man reserves for his closest friends
or dearest enemies. Mr Connor has been
there, too, for 30 years.
In Brisbane he spent his time where
he likes best to spend his time—in a pub.
Not with the Top People but with the
“wonderful bloody workers”. No visit-
ing celebrity since the Queen has had
quite so many important personages
wanting to meet him. And no other visitor
has handled such requests quite so ex-
plicitly. He said only that he didn’t want
to meet them. Bill Connor would much
rather spend his fabled expense account
buying basic wage earners a beer.
One of the few official invitations he
accepted in Australia was to eat luncheon
with the Governor-General. (He would
have knocked that back if he hadn’t been
able to fit it in without altering his
schedule.) “People don’t seem to realise
I’m always in a bloody hurry”, he told
me. “By the way, mate”, he went on,
“can you come to dinner with me tonight
and bring your missus? Can't leave her
sitting home watching telly by herself.”
At Cairns (which he said was a bloody
marvellous place with bloody marvellous
pubs full of bloody marvellous people
drinking in them) he hot-looted across
to Green Island and spent a sunburnt day
alternating between standing with feet
together (as is his wont) in the hotel
bar and peering in rapt wonder through
a glass-bottomed boat at the Barrier Reef.
“Never knew there were so many ruddy
fish in the sea—and the colors, mate!
They're even brighter than tropical
birds!”
Now 54, mildly diabetic, balding, red-
faced and solid, he talks much as he
writes with punch and precision. And
he doesn't muck about with chit-chat.
‘"Don't look at me so unblinkingly when
you're telling me a yarn, Curnow,” he
said, “I never believe a man who looks
me straight in the eyes ALL the time”.
There is nothing he won’t talk about
cantankerously, inquisitively, bitingly,
caustically, factually, cheerily, aggres-
sively, cryptically, feelingly, waspishly,
ferociously, eagerly, sensitively, or scath-
ingly—but never overtly. His opinions,
you can't help feeling, are his own. As
when he equates royalty as practised in
Britain with fairytales as presented in Dis-
neyland. “The great hope of Australia,
speaking as a rank outsider, is that this re-
markable fusion of Italians, Greeks, Ger-
mans and others that have been absorbed
here since the war will help rid your
Mother-Country minds of some of the
near-fanatical devotion to Walt Disney a
la Buck House,” he said. (He sees im-
ported Governors as a ridiculous relic of
the colonial past. “Ain’t you got any local
lads who could do the job just as well,
then?”)
He despises newspapers who bow under
pressure from outsiders and live in daily
fear of offending advertisers. “When the
‘Mirror’ had only 750,000 circulation we
never hesitated to insult advertisers. The
public loved us for it. Now we've got five
million circulation and the advertisers
love us for it.”
Not above describing a princess as a
bitch, or a politician as a bastard, he also
doesn't hesitate to assert his lack of
opinion if he doesn't have any. Each
time we heard him asked what he thought
of Queensland he said only: “I don't
know.” And each time he then asked
his enquirer what he thought of the
place.
His stoically staunch paunch heaves
with hate at the faintest aroma of hy-
pocrisy, humbug, pomposity, red tape and
hearty handshakes. (They're suspect, too,
and, besides, they hurt.) His memory,
which is a long one, reflects much of his
interest in the people who surround him.
Of a score or so of mutual acquaintances
on the “Mirror”, whom I asked him
about, he knew the personal details of
all but two.
Asked if he enjoys being the world’s
top columnist, he winces visibly and says
he enjoys the money very much. Among
his loves are working-class people and
cats. “God’s masterpiece is a cat”, he
said. “It's self-sufficient, strong, forceful
and won't take No for an answer. A
few more blokes made in the mould of
cats and newspapers would be a much
better place to work in.”


The Well-Tempered
Duo-Pianists
Forty years in tune
By JAN SMITH
HEN * arrive in a town I’m
\\/ Dame Nellie Melba,” said
” ” Lindley Evans, quoting h ; s
former employer. “A week later I’m
Nellie. A month later I’m Melba and
six months later I’m that old cow.”
Celebrities born of promoters and plan-
ned obsolescence may have a short time
to live, but in the w'orld of classical duo-
piano, Melba’s law of diminishing ap-
preciation works itself out as a safe
joke.
People may have been surprised when
the pair announced their 40th anni-
versary concert at the Town Hall last
month, but Frank Hutchens and Lind-
ley Evans are so much a part of our life
that a great many more people w'ould
have been surprised if they hadn't, an
announcement as unthinkable as an
Education Week without Shakespeare,
or a Messiah-less Easter.
Together they have taught and studied
at the Conservatorium for nearly 50
years, in cool high - ceilinged rooms
smelling of pianos and re-echoing with
intricate fingerwork of Czerny, Brahms
and Bach. They have examined students
from secondary schools throughout Aus-
tralia—often on their own compositions
like “At The Bathing Pool” (Hutchens)
and “Tally Ho” (Evans) and conducted
David Jones’ Christmas Choir.
The ABC finds them a godsend as
broadcasters, pianists and composers.
Evans has conducted several light clas-
sical sessions and a generation of Aus-
tralians have heard him as the Argo-
nauts’ Melody Man, a weekly stint for
the last 23 years. Both have composed
major works; Hutchens’ Concerto for
Two Pianos and Orchestra, and Con-
certo for Piano and Strings, and Evans’
Bush Symphony and Idyll for Two
Pianos and Orchestra.
So ingrained is their habit of team-
work that an interview with them gives
one a strange feeling of psychic control,
rather like conducting a very well-
trained orchestra with both hands tied
behind your back. With a gentle incli-
nation of the head, themes are expound-
ed, expanded and resolved, never over-
lapping and never clashing.
“The anniversary concert raised nearly
£1500,” said Lindley Evans, fingers
silently exercising and pedal foot
accelerating. “The money goes to the
Students’ Aid Fund we launched ten
years ago, but we only use the interest,
which is about £l5O a year. We don't
always spend it because it's best not to
be tied down, and this way we can use
the accumulated interest for overseas
grants to really exceptional people, like
young Betty laggard who went abroad
in 1962 and is now a violinist with the
Concertgebouw Orchestra in Amster-
dam.”
The money might also be used to
commission special works from compo-
sers, but this was rare, as music never
got the attention that was given so
lavishly to art, and even literature. “It's
difficult to put a finger on any one
promising composer,” Evans said, “but
there’s a little group who wouldn’t sur-
prise me if they came up with something
really good.”
The trouble, said Hutchens, was the
lack of indigenous musical culture to
draw on. Bereft of folk songs, work
songs and musically inclined gypsies,
Australia offered its composers little in-
spiration. “There are certain work
songs,” Hutchens admitted, “but they're
nearly all imported tunes, and even
‘Waltzing Matilda’ is musically suspect,
although it’s the closest thing we’ve got
to a spontaneous, national song.”
Anthropological curiosity
Tuvans now, recalling his work on the
music for Charles Chauvel’s film
“The Uncivilised”. “They brought a
crowd of Aborigines down from Arnhem
Land to give us some idea, you know.
I thought I w'as going to have a won-
derful time, finding the real Australian
music, but they just sat there with
closed lips saying mmmmm. There have
been arrangements of what purports to
be indigenous music, but it’s usually
dressed up in some way.” Expeditions
setting out from Adelaide, said Evans,
had collected a lot of Aboriginal music,
but he feared it would remain an anthro-
pological curiosity.
“What is a typical Australian song?”
Hutchens asked, quoting the O. Henry
story about the typical man about town.
“He didn't know until he got run over,
and we won’t know until someone
listens and says it’s you. Naturally I'm
flattered when Eric Baume says I should
be asked to compose a new national
anthem,” Hutchens said, “but these
things don’t happen that way.” “Not
like building a skyscraper, you know,”
Evans explained. “It’s got to emerge
from the heart of the people them-
selves.”
“ ‘Land of Hope and Glory’ was an
excellent example of a spontaneously
adopted national song. Elgar never in-
tended it to be anything but one of the
‘Pomp and Circumstance’ marches,”
Hutchens said, “but the British people
took it to their hearts. On the final
night of the Promenade concerts, when
people are paying one and six to sit on
the floor, it's sung the way a national
song should be sung - full of fervor'
and patriotism. A most moving experi-
ence.”
“In any case,” said Evans, “we’ve
tried the deliberate approach and it
hasn't worked.” The Musical Associa-
tion, of which Evans is president, tried
some years ago and got as far as award-
ing a prize, but no one took much
notice.” “Remember ‘Sydney, I Love
You’?” Hutchens asked. “It won a
newspaper contest but who hears it
now?”
A catchy tune was hard to come by
in their circles. True, little children
were singing Percy Grainger’s “Country
Gardens” (itself of English extraction)
but hardly from chauvinism. “A com-
mercial for canned vegetables, is it?”
Hutchens queried, marvelling at the
netherworld of television. “Grainger
was a friend of ours, you know. His
‘Handel In The Strand’ is one of our
favorite pieces.”
Television had, however, been a bless-
ing to Ron Grainer, a former Hutchens
pupil who has been praised for his
theme music for the Maigret and Step-
toe and Son series, both shown in Aus-
tralia. “Ron had a very tough time of
it when he first went to London,” Evans
said, “but he couldn't have chosen a
better place to use his special talents.”
The biggest change they'd noticed
since their early Town Hall concerts
(the first duo-concert was in 1924) was
the acoustics. “I’m no expert on the
technical side of it,” Hutchens warned,
“but I do know they’ve got rid of a lot
of the pockets that used to cause
trouble, and the echo has less time lag
now.”
Audiences, although coming from
every age group, seem to contain a
larger number of elderly people, many
of them associated with Evans and
Hutchens in the early days. But among
the three most steadfast attenders, only
Sir Kenneth Street remains. “Elioth
Gruner never missed a concert,” Evans
recalled, “and neither did George Lam-
bert. He'd come in with his opera
cloak and crush hat and walk right
down to the very front seat, loving
every minute of it. He was really an
Englishman, of course.”

rather music lessons, were far less real
and earnest. “Lessons were something
of a social occasion,” JJutchens recalled.
“Something you fitted in between lunch-
eon and afternoon tea, unless something
better turned up. Remember those girls
from Greenwich, Frank? The dozens
of lessons they never took? But they
never minded paying, or insisted on
making them up another day.”
Today, with young ladies earning
their living, a music teacher’s day has
developed a marked five o'clock rush,
which can last up to seven or eight at
night, leaving little time for the practice
which even an established duo-pianist
needs.
Some years ago Evans and his wife
Marie built a 25-footer, Sea Drift, in
their backyard at Strathfield, but since
moving to Woolwich, on the lower
North Shore, he finds little time for any-
thing but a weekly game of bowls. “I
own a house,” Evans said apologetically.
“You know how much time that leaves
you.” Frank Hutchens, who married
his pupil Joyce White in 1955, lives at
Gordon and spends his spare time at a
weekender at Dee Why.
Neither listens much to “great” music.
“After all these years there’s not much
a new performer can squeeze out of it,”
Evans said, “so when a new pianist or
conductor comes along I like to hear
him on a contemporary work.” Eng-
lish pianist John Ogden, soloist in two
Malcolm Williamson concerts later this
year, will be a big night out for both
of them.
Both are rich in anecdotes about
famous people Evans about his years
as Melba's accompanist, and Hutchens
about his childhood recital for Paderew-
ski, in Wellington. “It was my head-
master who engineered the whole thing,”
Hutchens recalled. “My parents were
music teachers and generally busy, so
when the headmaster thought I should
ask the Prime Minister about playing
for Paderewski, they were quite happy
to let me go alone on a train from
Hawera to Wellington.”
After an early morning wait on the
doorstep, Hutchens was able to put his
request to Seddon. Although Paderew-
ski's visit was strictly in his Prime
Ministerial capacity, Seddon saw it as a
good chance to boost local musical
talent, and took Hutchens down to the
great man’s hotel. After an hour of
Beethoven, Bach and Hutchens’ “Cadet
March” (written for the Hawera Band
when he was 10), Paderewski recom-
mended serious study abroad at Lon-
don's Royal Academy.
Fresh from Capetown
Tn 1908, three years after his arrival,
Hutchens was the youngest sub-pro-
fessor of the Academy, and by 1914 he
came to Australia as a Professor at
the New South Wales Conservatorium.
One of his first students was Lindley
Evans, fresh from a young musical
career in Capetown as boy singer and
later organist, with his father, at the
Anglican Cathedral. By 1920, through
his friendship with flautist John Lem-
mone, he had been invited by Melba to
visit England as her accompanist.
Melba didn't actually rap Evans over
the knuckles, but there were times when
her effect on him was much the same.
Still, it was a valuable and worthwhile
experience, says Evans, and he is quick
to reveal the Melba he knew, a gentle,
tenderhearted woman who once called
her friend Lemmone down from Syd-
ney to fire a secretary because she
couldn't bear to do it herself.
“She really made me jump through
hoops,” Evans said. “I got blown up
for all sorts of things. If the light was
a foot too high it'd be my fault. But
she could be very warm and human,
always inviting people to her home, and
never being in the least put out if they
turned up six months later and she
couldn’t remember their names she’d
simply ask them to sign the visitors’
book.”
Evans sympathised with the old story
about Melba advising Dame Clara Butt
to sing ’em muck. “Nellie was happiest
singing modern French songs, so you
can imagine how she'd feel when some
unsteady voice from the gallery would
cry, ‘Home, Sweet Home, Nellie!’ It
happened all the time.”
Another time, hearing that a friend's
Melbourne concert was being poorly


patronised, Melba boosted attendances
by sending her students along. “It was
a violinist called Zimbalist,” Evans be-
gan, with Hutchens adding proudly that
it was indeed the father of the one we
saw on television. “A very famous
name,” he added.
In public life he admits Melba was
tough and particular, and suffered fools
with enviable repartee. “It was so differ-
ent in those days,” Evans said. “A
celebrity was really something, and the
prima donna was the ultimate in fame
and glory. You met them with bated
breath and didn’t wash your right hand
for a week.” He looked at Hutchens,
who admitted the same awe for Pader-
ewski. “Nowadays it’s the conductors
who are the prima donnas,” Evans con-
eluded.
Cut-lunch Culture
A step in the right direction
By PATRICIA ROLFE
Browsing through our files, trying
to establish once and for all what
were the great days of The
Bulletin, we came across pieces which
seem as fresh as if they had been written
yesterday. For instance, in the issue of
July 14, 1904, a piece from London
began: “I find London somewhat disap-
pointing. There is nothing like the en-
thusiasm for art and letters that I
expected to find here —in fact, there is
no enthusiasm for anything.”
The writer goes on to say that he had
a long yarn with Yeats and Lady
Gregory about Australia. “What Yeats
reckoned we required now was a
National Theatre, like the Irish Theatre.
He gave some advice —from experience.
Take a small hall, get amateurs who
believe in it, have them trained by a
professional, and run into as little ex-
pense as possible, so that a failure won't
matter—and begin by little one-act plays
in prose; verse afterwards if you are a
poet and long plays when you can
construct. Yeats thinks this National
Australian dramatic movement should
start now.”
That was a scant three generations
ago, and the National Australian theatre
movement is still going forward at about
the same pace as then. However,
Sydney s lunch-hour theatres seem closer
to the lines suggested by Yeats
than any number of grandiose projects
and may yet prove the step in the right
direction.
The Elizabethan Theatre Trust, which
thought up the lunch-hour theatre idea
first then dropped it when it lost the
alace 1 heatre, will try again this month
tinder the direction of Mr Robin Love-
l°y, one of its most experienced theatre
aien. [lie first production will be N. F.
mipson s “A Resounding Tinkle” at the
t. James’ Hall. After a couple of weeks
er e, the play will transfer to Grace
r °s four shops, one in the city and
rcc in the suburbs, for one week at
ac h- Grace Bros have the reputation
for being particularly astute in planning
and running their suburban shops. They
may be as successful as theatre
promoters.
As Mr Lovejoy points out, this is
making the theatre more accessible to
audiences in no uncertain terms. “People
said that audiences wouldn't go to New-
town because it was too remote,” he
said. If they won't go to a lunch-hour
play in their own suburb, when they’re
on their way to buy their husband’s
singlet, then we shall know that the pro-
blem of the audience is not inaccessibility
and we'll have to find out what else is
wrong with the theatre.”
Mr Lovejoy said for practical reasons
the lunch-hour theatre has to be regard-
ed as an extra source of work for actors;
that is, it can't cut into the time given
over to radio and TV work, which
generally provides local actors with
bread-and-butter income, and often any
cake they get too. Lunch-hour audi-
ences in the suburbs will probably be
the same as those in the city, not so
often the office worker as the middle-
aged woman with time on her hands
who wants to get off her feet.
In the hiatus between Elizabethan’s
ventures, the Q Theatre group has car-
ried on in Sydney with lunch-hour plays
at the AMP theatrette. The group began,
its spokesman, Mr Walter Sullivan, said,
before Christmas. The idea was to put
on a children's play to take up the
summer slack in radio and TV work.
The children's play didn't eventuate
and the group plunged straight into
lunch-hour theatre with Pinter’s “The
Dumb Waiter.” They have since done
John Mortimer's “The Dock Brief,”
Chekhov's “The Proposal” and
“George,” for which the adaptation
from short story to one-acter was done
by Miss Patricia Hooker. Two perfor-
mances a day have been cut to one, not
because of lack of support but so that
the plays do not cut too far into the
actors' other commitments.
The group may seem to have only
proved what the Elizabethan knew —
that there are audiences for lunch-hour
plays. However, the remarkable thing
is that the group got going with a capi-
tal of £3O. So they have proved not only
that there are audiences for good plays
but that you don't need to spend vast
sums of money to prove it. If part of
the theatre's work is proselytising, the
group must this year have played be-
fore considerably more people than the
Elizabethan's much-touted Old Tote.
The Q group are all professional
actors, and it is run on democratic lines,
within, Mr Sullivan point out, the limits
of actors’ egos. The group has managed
to keep to its plan of not engaging any
actor without payment. This is very
laudable, but it has meant that members
of the group have themselves played
without payment. Their original invest-
ment of £3O is probably as safe as if
they’d put it in BHP but it hasn’t grown.
However, Mr Lovejoy hopes that after
he has pioneered the suburban circuit,
some of the Q group’s plays may follow
his productions there.
Setting Down Papua’s Story
“Cautiously advance atomic age!”
By RENATA COCHRANE
In his recently published book “New
Guinea: The Last Frontier”, Gavin
Souter uses the lines of a poem as
section headings to mark the passage of
time in New Guinea’s history. The author
of this poem is A. P. Allan Natachee,
and it is typical of this gentle, retiring
Papuan that he was not even aware that
his poem had been used.
The poet’s real name is Avaisa Pin-
ongo Allan Natachee. Pinongo was his
father’s name. At home in the Mekeo
village of Amo Amo, the child was
known as Avaisa. His mother died when
he was five and at the Inawaia Catholic
Mission school he became known by his
Christian name, Allan. “At school”,
Allan remembers, “the Sister used to
tell us stories. There was one about an
Indian called Natachee. Sister said I was

like him, so everyone started calling me
Natachee and the name stayed with me”.
Later, Allan progressed to the De La
Salle Brothers’ school at Bomana, near
Port Moresby. When war came, he was
recruited as a carrier for the Australian
Army and sent to Bulldog. But the offi-
cers said he was too young and told him
to go back to school. But schooling was
virtually over for the war years, and
Allan drifted through a number of jobs,
first in the Mekeo, then, when peace
came, in Port Moresby.
It must have been about this time that
Allan began to write.
In 1950, a Mr Barwick told the Senior
Broadcasts Officer, Mr P. N. Cochrane,
that there was a young Papuan staying
in the boyhouse who was always writing
in a big black book. This seemed unusual
as many of the rising generation had
grown up during the war years with
little or no schooling. Very soon, Allan
was on the broadcasting staff. His new
employer said:
Recipe for beer
|“ Allan’s black book was big indeed.
! On the first page was a recipe for
making beer. He said a cookboy had
given it to him. I very nearly decided to
look no further. A good deal had been
copied out of other people’s books, but
some of the writing was original. We
took Allan on as a translator. He could
speak five languages, some of which we
were using in our vernacular broadcasts.”
Soon after Allan started work, a fun
fair—the first to be seen by the native
people—was set up in Port Moresby. One
of his first assignments was to write a
news story about it. He came back with
a poem. The Broadcasts Officer said: “I
explained news coverage to Allan all
over again and told him to rewrite the
story in prose. He came back with a
sonnet with a terrific punch in the
tail—
For here we go in wild merry-go-
round with dolls,
Round and round in merry-go-
, round with dolls and balls.”
From careful questioning I was con-
vinced that Allan had never heard of
sonnets and that this was quite spon-
taneous.
After this, we gave away news-
riting for Allan. Instead, he was as-
signed to write down the legends of his
People. Sometimes he must have worked
all night because in the morning the
nished legend would be on my desk,
ora tel y decorated in colored inks
‘ln traditional Mekeo designs. Soon
? m barked on a ‘Legendary History
°t the Mekeo People’.
“In nearly everything he wrote, Allan
sooner or later slipped into verse. The
curious fact was that he appeared to be
an instinctive poet in the English lan-
guage, besides having a gift for the
poetic interpretation of his own Mekeo
folklore”.
He seems to have set great store by
voices, for he wrote:
“We all know that sweet and kind
voice is good in some way,
Blit we know also it never makes
one succeed,
So please, whoever you may be,
for now and for aye,
1 tell you that sweet and kind
voice I do not heed.”
However, for the most part, Allan’s
poetry was concerned with deeper issues
—the difficulties of his people emerging
from the womb of the Stone Age to the
fierce glitter of the Atomic Age:
“Courageously advance atomic age
step by step,
And crush under your foot our
stone age,
It cannot and will never resist your
mighty step,
Cautiously advance atomic age!
Hark and behold, our stone age is
swaying and groaning,
Right beneath your mighty step of
pain,
Hatingly and stubbornly resisting
and frowning,
But forever, and ever in vain.”
In collecting legends, Allan was a
perfectionist.
“It was the old men I went to find,”
he said. “They came in from the villages
to sell betel nut and would stay in town
with their sons or brothers for a few
days. These old men—especially the
sorcerers remembered the stories, all
of them. The young men were no
good.”
Often it would take Allan two or three
days to complete his self-imposed assign-
ment and during this time he would
scarcely appear at the office. Eventually
this cost him his job. For the past
several years he has been working as a
wood machinist and clerk with a build-
ing firm. With lack of stimulus the fire
has died down and for a long time he
has written nothing. A suggestion that
he should write a poem about the recent
elections revealed a sad lack of form.
Allan’s work has been published in
“Oceania” and the Journal of the PNG
Public Service. Little has been seen of
his excellent “Legendary History”. As
the first Papuan to communicate his
thoughts and preserve his people’s cul-
tural heritage outside the village level,
this seems a serious omission in Austra-
lian publishing. From a personal angle
the kudos for Allan Natachee’s work (up
to the present) has gone not to the poet
himself but to those who have had the
perspicacity to recognise its intrinsic
worth.


Barwick in Retrospect
Leaving politics with regrets
By IAN DUNSTAN
The week before Sir Garfield Bar-
wick’s appointment as Chief Justice
was the most difficult in his life,
involving a genuinely agonising choice
•—politics or the law? In the event he
plumped for the law. Political con-
siderations certainly influenced him. Sir
Robert Menzies seems certain to fight
the next elections, and why not? He is
remarkably robust. He can go the polls
with a large majority and moreover it is
hard to see, when he is 73, to what else
but politics he would want to direct his
capacious talents. The real struggle for
power will begin four years from now
when Sir Garfield will be nudging 65. He
might well win that struggle.' But if he
did not it is hard to see him as, say,
Harold Holt's Foreign Minister. And in
the ordinary course of events you only
get one shot at being Chief Justice.
But politics wasn’t all of it. There re-
mained Barwick's predilection for the
law, his respect for it and his great
capacity within it. Those who know him
say that he would never return to ad-
vocacy, to the now stale tricks and
techniques which he knew better than
most, but opinion writing is a different
thing and it is that very largely that he
undertakes when he becomes Chief
Justice of one of the free world’s great
courts with a quarter century in front
of him, during a period of great social
and economic change, in which to make
a contribution to Australian history.
Although he does not leave politics—
for which he has an instinctive, some-
times a profound, feeling without
regrets, he was not a successful politician
in many respects. He lacked, for in-
stance, the Prime Minister’s touch and
timing and although he became less ab-
rasive over the last few years and appear-
ed more compromising in temperament
there were characteristics that betrayed
him as a politician his cocky, imper-
turbable self confidence which jarred
more susceptible people, his assertive in-
dependence of judgment and mind, his
obvious freedom from pressure groups
and cliques, his inability to maintain
one might almost say his contemptuous
refusal to seek good relations with
the Press.
Nevertheless, Barwick achieved a great
deal in two political fields. He will pro-
bably be remembered best for his work
as an energetic and reforming Attorney-
General rather than as Minister for Ex-
ternal Affairs. It may be unfair but it
is inevitable. An Attorney - General’s
work is enshrined in carefully planned
and enunciated legislation—in his case
in the reformed Crimes Act, the Uniform
Divorce Law, the Marriage Act and the
controversial legislation on Restrictive
Practices on which he labored so
hard, met so much opposition and from
which he is said still to hope much. As
Foreign Minister he dealt with tough,
intractable, fast-changing problems- and
his achievements are not enshrined in
anything except in a series of conferen-
ces, departmental files and the high re-
gard in which he came to be held by
the professional diplomats of External
Affairs.
As Foreign Minister he brought con-
siderable gifts to his job—some unexpect-
ed. He was undogmatic and flexible. He I
worked extremely hard. He read the
documents, the submissions, the des-
patches. He found out quickly how the
department worked and he made it
work better. He saw his officers regular-
ly, listened to them and usually drew out
the best qualities in them. He approver
independent attitudes within a concensus
of opinion. He interested himself in th:
foreign posts and the conditions of wort i[
Because Australia has a ®
number of Asian posts, he sought to in v
crease the number and importance c"
European posts not merely because the "
could serve as relief posts after the rigor 3
of Saigon or Djakarta but because hi 11
believed fervently Australia must be take:'! 1
notice of and because he wished to em 11
phasise that Australia is a part of th 11
Western world while situated in th 11
southernmost corner of Asia. Henc' 1
the despatch of Australian police!
Cyprus.
Although 61, he is more thoroughly
and soundly aware than people he
his age of the sort of world Australia:
living in. This quality made him a
innovator of ideas and fresh approach
He maintained a consistent, person: l;
correspondence with Asian and Europe: a
politicians. He wrote privately to Salaza 1
for example, on the problems of Port. *
guese Timor which could so easily cor 1
pound our problems to the north. P
could act decisively when he thoug! 1
he should. When he was Acting Extern l 1
Affairs Minister some years ago he mat 11
a decisive and sudden decision to switc 11
Australia’s vote on South Africa in th 3
UN. The story in Canberra has it th:
when the PM learnt of the changedvvol!! l!
he was dismayed and asked the reaso 11
why. Barwick explained the problem 1
of voting for South Africa in a wori n
where color issues were becoming in r
creasingly acute. Sir Robert agreed will 1
the force of the argument but added 11
little sadly, “I’m thinking of South Afrit'
in this nevertheless. I know what ii
like to be without friends.”. In mam"
ways Barwick was at his best with Asia’
politicians, most of whom liked him
finding in him a certain down-to-eart'
Australian commonsense allied to a vet
sharp mind.
They found him different from tto
British whom Barw'ick genuinely ad-
mires but is said to believe, sadl)
enough, that they too frequently I<#
their “touch” in Asia. It is said his
blood froze at the Malaysia Day dinner
when Duncan Sandys turned to Thai-
land’s cultivated Foreign Minis®
Thanat Khoman, exchanged name
and asked genially, “Do you speak
English?” Khoman returned the comp l
ment neatly later on when Sandys ex
plained how he nearly visited Thai®
years ago when he was War Minis®

‘And what,” asked Khoman pleasantly,
‘have they made you now?”
It is said that after dinner Barwick
nade his mark with Khoman by asking
iim with a twinkle in his eye how his
English was coming along.
But making friends with Asians wasn’t
Iways easy even when they were pro-
western. They were touchy with
nti-colonialism and suspicious of the
.ntentions of a White Australia. Lee
liian Yew was probably one of the
nti-Australian Asian politicians who
ever responded to Barwick’s charm.
Warwick didn't always succeed in getting
is message across elsewhere either. On
line occasion in conversation with Pre-
iident Soekarno he pointed out that
rare power was generated in Australia
h a month than in Indonesia in a year,
t was a gallant attempt but it failed,
he President leant across and said, “So
'hat?” However, Barwick got the point
-statistics about a friendly neighbor’s
idustrial potential cuts no ice with a
:jspicious, sensitive Asian nationalism.
>ut with his lawyer’s training he
probed and tested. He didn’t take
; atements from foreign politicians on
rice value, probably few Foreign Mini-
vers ever do. But he always knew enough
pout the political, social and economic
onditions in foreign countries to find
ut whether what was being said to him
ood up. Part of his ability lay in his
uick understanding of the internal situa-
,on of other countries, especially Asian
pes, and why their spokesmen said the
.lings they did at the time they said
'em. Although he was severely chas-
I sed by some newspapers for his cele-
rated remark that Asians don’t always
,iy what they mean, he was right. Words
1 common use in Indonesia and Aus-
.alia have different meanings some-
mes, are charged with different feelings
nd emotions. He might have said more
orrectly that Asians don’t always say
hat they mean. However, his quick-
ess, even when it led him to some
initially facile conclusions, was one of
,ts more outstanding characteristics as
Minister and it enabled him to get to the
aain point of complicated situations very
uickly.
The main point is vitally important to
iim. Talking to a friend about Timor
>ne day he picked out the Britannica
:ntr y, reading out the statistics about
land, government, history and people.
Then, delightedly, “and you see, of
Papuan origins”. He was on to a sig-
nificant fact like a flash.
Barwick worked hardest, however, at
tr Fng to fashion a modern Australian
0re 'gn policy which had to take into
acc ount a difficult neighbor like Indo-
| nes, a. It is said that he still looks back
founded on the wasted, sterile years
I en Australia supported the Dutch in
West New Guinea in face of mounting
Asian opposition and decreasing support
from our great and powerful friends.
Had New Guinea been internationalised
in 1951 . . . but then that is reading
history backward.
Reading it forwards he finds it an
appalling thought that Indonesia and
Australia should adopt permanently
hostile attitudes. That is why he has gone
so carefully with Indonesia over Malay-
sia, making Australia's Malaysian com-
mitments unmistakably clear but with-
out offence or hostility or anger. He
has been the apostle of graduated re-
sponses but his care and his timing have
never obscured his underlying firmness
of intent. And in this he has carried the
Prime Minister with him. But the con-
duct of foreign relations is a day-to-day
thing. It may be a fascinating job but
its achievements are necessarily diffuse
and mostly unpublicised and, moreover,
reached only after considerable effort
and time. He has made the effort but
he has had too short a time.

When you choose industrial rubber products durability
is of prime importance. Illustrated are seven striking
examples of the lasting qualities of Goodyear products.
But that is only part of the story. The
choice of a Goodyear product may
begin with many other aspects of its
use: extreme temperature conditions;
the need to withstand prolonged ex-
posure to weather; an unusual use
calling for a special design.
Goodyear meets such demands with
unrivalled world-wide experience in
industrial rubber. It comes to you
through the G.T.M. (Goodyear Tech-

immediate, expert advice on any pro-
blem, and he is as near as your tele-
phone. When you need the answer to
a question about rubber, call him, or

The Return of the Rock
Gattellari comes good again...
By DISCUS
In the year or so since he fought Sal
Algieri, an American who boxed
like the jawbone of an ass, our
national flyweight champion Rocky Gat-
tellari has been booed into the ring and
booed out again, a fact which has
pained him.
“Always I give my best, why do they
boo me?” or words to that effect, come
from Rocky’s heart each time he has
bowled over another imported fighter and
received the famous Bronx cheer or
worse from the crowd.
The trouble goes back further than
the Algieri match, to the time when
Rocky won his title in two matches
with Jackie Bruce and seemed to make
more of it than Cassius Clay. Each fight
was preceded and followed by news-
paper articles under Rock’s name, in
which his emotions seemed to run away
with his sense.
“Tomorrow the world!” was one of
the less sensational of his statements,
after some four professional matches.
It was during boxing’s most recent
boom, when Sid Prior and Gattellari
were both coming up fast, especially
Prior, who was tumbling importations
who had been too much for the welter
champion Gary Cowburn, since retired.
It was an exciting time, and it was
natural for the afternoon newspapers to
make the most of it. But they also made
a fool of Gattellari and the advisers who
allowed him to put his name to such
nonsense.
Even the Italians in Sydney seemed
to think so, and they blamed the Rock
and booed him as heartily as anyone
when a week of big talk by Sal Algieri
ended in a one-punch fiasco at Sydney
Stadium, with Gattellari and his hand-
lers reacting as though he had done
something to be proud of in weathering
a puff of wind.
Sober fight enthusiasts could not help
contrasting the Gattellari camp’s hoop-
de-doo in this and other minor matches
with the quiet efficiency of our feather-
weight champion, Wally Taylor, who
fought his way into the world ratings in
matches with such good men as Don
Johnson and Love Allottey, in Mel-
bourne.
But after his year or so in disfavor,
Rocky Gattellari has made good. Last
month he outboxed a boy named
Natalio Jiminez, from the Americas,
someone who has not only figured in
some of the recent world ratings but
also looked as though he deserved to.
Jiminez was fast, tricky, and aggres-
sive. Their early rounds were fought at
the speed you expect from flyweights,
but rarely get. At times Jiminez stood
bowing from the waist at great speed
while Gattellari tried to tag him. And
at times he took the fight to Rocky.
It seemed to me that if Jiminez had
been a capable hooker rather than an
ear-slapper he would have taken Gat-
tellari, but this is the one reservation I
have on Rocky’s performance. He came
through all the bustling, all the clever
infighting, all the tiresome chasing after
an elusive target, and all the hammering
he got in the corners. And in the ninth
round his strength was as great as ever,
while Jiminez wilted and finally had the
good sense to quit.
Then, at last, Gattellari heard a whole
Stadium cheer him, whistle, stamp on
the bleacher seats, and chant, “Rocky,
Rocky, Rocky.” Music that laid the
ghost of Algieri.
I’ve had serious doubts about Gattel-
lari’s ability, but in this match and an
earlier one against Ray Perez he has
met men who have tested him
thoroughly in every department of
boxing. Now that is so, it would be a
sour person who would continue to
knock the Rock.
As I have pointed out before, most of
the world’s top ten flyweights are in
Japan, the Philippines, and Thailand.
Only one of the ten, Walter McGowan,
is In England. Let him stay there.
Gattellari seems at the top of his
powers now. He has his defects, but so
do most fighters. Right now, he has
youth, strength, and wild enthusiasm for
the game, and he’s a very good fighter.
This is the time when his camp should
go all out for a match with the top man,
Kingpetch of Thailand, or the former
title-holder, Ebhara of Japan. It would
be a mistake to try to work Gattellari up
through the ratings. Kingpetch was rele-
gated to sixth position when he lost the
title, but he was the one who regained it,
and that’s how much the ratings mean.
Rocky might seem an easy mark to
one of the top men now that he has just
appeared on their horizon. It would be
good tactics to let one of them take him
seriously in about Round Two, when all
the tricks have been tried and the Rock
is still in there fighting like the prover-
bial threshing machine. ,

roam the world on “expenses” plus, as
long as they first did the right thing
here, played in the little tournaments,
attracted the spectators, and gave im-
proving players some practice.
This could be likened to asking the
Australian cricket team to play its way
around Australia before leaving for the
bigtime and the big money.
Some such thought must have occur-
red to the so-called “rebels” of tennis,
the only big sport of amateur status
which sends teams abroad regularly.
Surely their achievements overseas, giv-
ing the sport year-round renown, should
be enough? But in addition the boys
bring gate money home, as in cricket,
whenever they defend or challenge for
the Davis Cup. Last year’s ground and
TV film profits were, I believe, about
£33,500.
This is a materialistic time. The
LTAA is being obtuse and very old-
fashioned when it asks its young people
to think of themselves last, although
this would do tennis in Australia no par-
ticular good; it would cost them a great
deal.
It seems clear that the old gentlemen
of the LTAA, well meaning, with the
interests of tennis at heart, are quite
unrealistic and out of step with a time
which is no longer theirs, and is a long
way in outlook from the mores of their
day.

sional sport on the lines of amateur
sport of long ago, the LTAA forces its
leading players to become “rebels” by
asking them to contribute more than
any other amateur sport demands, or
would dare to demand, in the present.
Other amateur bodies control the
overseas trips of their most valued par-
ticipants, but they do not make a cer-
tain number of circuit or tournament
appearances the price that must be paid
for the trip. And this the LTAA has
done, even though it did not have the
courage to put it like that, but set a
meaningless date instead.
It should be sufficient for the LTAA
that its best players come home for the
state and national tournaments, and
the Davis Cup. It was the height of
stupidity to ask Emerson to stay around
after that, to give other players some
practice and swell the member associa-
tions’ funds.
The top players owe tennis nothing.
They give as much as they get, and even
when they turn professional many con-
tinue to give, in helping the Davis Cup
team to hit top form, and in coaching
—as for instance Frank Sedgman does
once a year with the schoolboy players
in Brisbane—for rather less than tourna-
ment money.
Last month the South Australian and
Queensland Lawn Tennis Associations
tried to have the ridiculous ban removed
from some of the “rebels”. For that
they received criticism and accusations
of backsliding from the other States,
The LTAA should have awarded them
medals for giving it a chance to reverse
a bad decision and still retain some
dignity.

April 18, about 66,000 people
crowded in to the Melbourne
Cricket Ground, equipped with flags
and streamers in the colors of Geelong
(the “Cats”) and Melbourne (the
“Demons”). The ball was bounced, and
the 1964 “Footy” season was on, with
last year’s premiers on top in their first
match, and the VFL carting another
load of bullion to the banks.
Even the amateur Association's main
match of the weekend drew 18,000
people, and the amateur game in Mel-
bourne has all the pulling power of Aus-
tralian Rules in Sydney.
And so we come to Soccer, whose
two top teams in Melbourne attracted
15,000 the same weekend.
In Adelaide, the top Australian
League game drew 14,500, and the top
Soccer match 3,500.
Sydney, where Soccer is stronger, or
Rugby League is weaker, had 17,500 at
the main Rugby game and 4,200 at the
main Soccer game of the weekend.
In Brisbane, the Australian League
game is still outdrawing Soccer, and
unless the Rugby League teams improve
there, the Australian code may be the
top game in a year or two.
So at the start of the football season,
the Australian code is stronger than
ever, Soccer is at a standstill, and Rugby
League hardly seems to need the
stadium to hold 100,000 which its elders
plan to build in Sydney.
Perhaps Soccer is pinning hopes on
the Everton team due to tour here this
winter, and Rugby League is counting
on the tour by France. But Melbourne’s
crowds, increasing each year, show
there’s nothing like a fast, open game
with well publicised local heroes to
make the turnstiles run hot.
The best that Rugby League has been
able to do in that line was a Sydney pre-
season match in which an experimental
rule was tried out. One of the slowing
factors in Rugby League is the “play
the ball - ’ rule, where a man who falls
with the ball is allowed to lumber to his
feet, while his team gets into position
behind him, and then rakes the ball with
his foot back to the man behind him.
This can happen 100 times in any
half hour, and it reduces some games to
an inching, slogging match. The experi-
ment was that any man falling with a
ball would have to get rid of it before
or as soon as he hit the turf, a notion
which a child of three could be expected
to grasp.
But the players in this match found
it difficult to let the ball go in time. The
play turned into a farce. The rule was
not a success the first time, and the
elders of Rugby League ordered it
abandoned at halftime, and ambled off
to their clubs to listen to the music of
the poker machines.
Soon Rugby League will be a game
of memories played in retrospect at the
bar of the district Leagues’ Club.
Everyone who wants some speed and
excitement will be at the Speedway.


Around Melbourne
BLACK SUNDAY FOR THE PORT GIRLS
'C'rom the very moment that we
heard a Soviet whaling fleet was
heading our way Melbourne trembled
with excitement. Heavens above,
there were 34 ships (two factory
ships and 32 whalers), the largest
fleet ever to visit Melbourne. Indeed,
rather more imposing than the entire
Royal Australian Navy. The mother
ship, the Sovietskaya Ukraina, was a
splendid 32,024 tons and the largest
whaling craft in the world. The word
went through that the Russians had
asked for and received permission
from GHQ in Odessa to spend
£75,000.
So it seemed that it would be like
the more beautiful days of the war.
Instead of Camels and Coca-Cola
there would be lashings of Laika
cigarettes and good Smirnoff vodka.
What’s more, the girls of the good old
Port Melbourne brigade looked for-
ward to nigh on 1800 seamen who had
seen no civilisation for seven frigid
months.
A big move was started to invite
all the Russians into private homes.
Parties were organised everywhere.
One of the big Bourke Street stores
smartly placed its ads in Russian;
another made it known that there
were 16 interpreters available to
assist seamen shoppers.
The first thing that went awry was
the captain’s move in keeping all his
men aboard on Saturday and then
giving them their first leave on the
Sunday. It has been said that the
only sign of life in Melbourne on a
Sunday is the smoke you get from
the crematorium. But this is untrue.
I don’t think you get any smoke from
the crematorium. It was our usual
respectful Melburnian Sunday.
No shops were open, admittedly,
nor was there any of our splended
national football, but we did throw
open the Botanic Gardens. Phar Lap
was available at the museum, and
there was the Zoo. Unfortunately, a
group of zoo-going Russians failed to
understand the closing announcements
at 5.30 p.m. and were locked in.
Well, the Port Melbourne girls
made no progress at all. Only once
did they look like making a hit. A
newspaper photographer made like a
Russian and started to give warm ro-
mantic signs from the ship. They
waved and cooed. Then he drew
himself up to his full height and said:
“Owya goin’, orright?”.
All invitations, except very select
affairs for the officers, were refused.
There was no fraternisation. On the
Sunday they left the ship progres-
sively in fours. Every two or three
minutes another four, and one rather
suspected that with each four there
was a junior commissar in charge.
Next day they wandered and wan-
dered; they bought toys and various
items of clothing, but much to the
sadness of the department stores,
they never did buy up big.
The obvious story for the news-
papers was to supply boy and girl
reporters and take the Russians on
a shopping tour. The offers were all
politely refused. Tattersall’s offered
them the greatest honor Melbourne
has to bestow, the drawing of the
first marble. The commodore said
a sailor would do this, but when the
fatal moment arrived nobody turned
up.
/"Vh, it was difficult. Even when you
wanted to take pictures of the Rus-
sians shopping they tended to melt out
of sight. The major success was
scored by the PR firm that went to
the ship with cases of Aerosol de-
odorant. The idea was this the
deodorant was the greatest. It could
make even a whaler smell like a rose.
The stuff was accepted. On the other
hand, the bra manufacturer who
wanted to re-shape the Russian
women “Look, no whale bone”
didn’t get to first bosom.
Your correspondent, along with
100,000 other Melburnians, called on
the Sovietskaya Ukraina. Our object
was to meet Commodore Alexei Sol-
yanik, 18 times to the Antarctic,
Order of the Red Star, Hero of Socia-
list Labor, three Orders of Lenin,
and director of the world’s largest
whaling fleet. The Commodore, almost
alone, was carrying the Russian pub-
lic relations job on his vat-like
shoulders. We were told that every
morning he had a work-out on the
rowing machine and punching bag
and dived into the swimming pool set
up on the deck. On those occasions
when it was extremely frigid the sea-
men chipped away the ice for the
Commodore to dive in.
So we worked our way past the
rowing machine and the punching
bag to the Commodore’s cabin. Over
the whole ship there was the type of
odor that 5000 whales or more tend
to leave behind them. The Com-
modore’s good English was the first
surprise; the second was Mrs Com-
modore. We knew that 71 women
were employed on secretarial and
scientific duties, but we weren’t pre-
pared for Svetlana.
The Commodore was 50. She was
25. When we entered the cabin she
was leaning languidly against the
bulkhead sniffing a single rosebud.
The hair was bouffant, the heels were
stiletto. She had the face of the
young Lauren Bacall, but a figure of
rather more ample and delightful
proportions. She didn’t speak Eng-
lish, but she had a way of talking
just the same. There was an old
American movie on the cabin TV.
Did she like old American movies?
Thereupon she indicated that she
liked the smell of old whales better.
Svetlana, we learned, was a science
graduate with diplomas in biology
and radio-engineering.
The Commodore was full of bon-
homie and bright sayings. “For the
whales first of all you must feel sorry
and hope they give you forgiveness.
That is the ladies’ way of thinking,
da? But the men are wiser—they
try to forgive the whales for the
terrible smell.” He was in the lovely
position of not having to ask anyone
forgiveness. He had caught 5139
whales, one under his quota, and he
was said to be carrying £5 million
worth of whale oil plus 370 lbs of
ambergis worth £3OO a pound. “Float-
ing gold” said the beaming Com-
modore. One almost felt that the
portraits of comrades Lenin and
Khrushchev, on either side of the
cabin, nodded in agreement.

Why censors should support
“The Group ”
By PETER COLEMAN
One of the curiosities of recent
censorship disputes is a new will-
ingness of many critics of censor-
ship, who for over 80 years have
claimed to stand for all the progressive
virtues, to parade any number of dis-
honest arguments in opposition to par-
ticular acts of censorship. In fact some
of them seem willing to say anything,
however absurd. Take the classic “Lady
Chatterley’s Lover” case. However
pleased we may have been with the
jury’s verdict, it was alarming, when
it wasn't funny, to see a famous Catho-
lic lawyer treating the book as a great
Catholic tract; a Protestant bishop
claiming all Protestants should read and
learn Christianity from it; Leftists treat-
ing it as a great expression of Left-
liberalism; critics regarding what is
obviously a minor work as one of Law-
rence’s greater efforts; and moralists
considering an obvious attack on mar-
riage as a defence of it. If these wit-
nesses believed what they said, they are
fools; if they did not believe it, they
have been willing to abandon intel-
lectual integrity for the sake of a poli-
tical victory.
In a minor way there was a similar
case in Sydney last year the Sepik
River statue case. Again, however
pleased we may have been with the
magistrate's verdict that it should not be
destroyed, it was a depressing experience
to listen to the witnesses. Art
were prepared to say this mediocre 1
not inferior work was a fine piece o
art; a professor said that the man in

is such a person as Mr. Ernest Hiller the label that goes on to
his suits is not a “brand name” but his own personal signature.
It’s a guarantee that the suit has been tailored to Mr. Hiller’s
demanding standards (hand detailed where only hand work
will do); that the materials are of a superb quality.

undisputed as is the value-for-money that goes with
every suit that carries his name. From £25.19.6.

the statue, who obviously had his sexual
organ in his mouth, may really have
been playing a flute; and Sir Herbert
Read claimed it may be a religious
statue.
Clearly a point of absurdity has been
reached at which, for all the equal or
worse absurdities sometimes advanced
by censors, it is time to reconsider the
whole argument not least because
discredited critics of censorship weaken
the case against the censorship of an
important book like “The Group”.
One of the troubles is historical.
Censors have never been very clever at
defending themselves, and ever since
the basic Hicklin judgment in 1868 they
have taken their stand on a weak argu-
ment which has encouraged them and
their critics to avoid the real issues.
This standard argument, derived
from Lord Cockburn in the Hicklin
case, is that a book should be banned
if it has a “tendency to corrupt” its im-
pressionable and likely readers. This
assumes a definite causal connection
between reading and being corrupted,
and is faced with the difficulty that
such a connection is usually impossible
to establish (probably because corrupted
people were already corrupt before they
read the book in question), and to the
counter-argument that reading, by help-
ing people let off steam, may actually
prevent vicious conduct by sublimating
it; that, in other words, obscene books
are a good thing.
Prejudices
T>ut if it has been easy for critics of
censorship, if not to topple this stan-
dard corruption argument at least to cast
doubt on it, they have rarely con-
fronted the stronger defence on which
most rational supporters of censorship
intuitively base themselves, even if they
do not always spell it out.
This other argument starts from a
theory about prejudice. Although the
word prejudice usually means outmoded
taboos which a civilisation gradually
overcomes, the censors begin with a dif-
ferent but equally sound idea of prejudice
the idea that certain prejudices are
the basis of civilisation, that civilisation
is, indeed, the cultivation of new and
stronger prejudices. There are the pre-
judices against moral or political vile-
ness; for example, against sadism,
bestiality, Nazi gas-chambers, Com-
munist terrorism. According to this
theory, a people without a strong sense
of shock, a strong prejudice against
vileness, is an uncivilised society, and
censorship is one of the State’s (minor)
techniques for the maintenance of a
community's prejudices, of its sense of
shock. On this view the State censors a
book from time to time, not to protect
weak individuals from being corrupted,
but to declare its support for these com-
munity prejudices and sense of shock.
Censorship, in other words, is not meant
to be individually protective but socially
declaratory, and it is a mark of civilised
or “mature” society.
This view of censorship is strength-
ened by two necessary qualifications.
Firstly, the prejudice or sense of civility
(or whatever word is used; “decency”
is probably the commonest) that censor-
ship is designed to support and encour-
age is not something changeless. It
changes all the time as it does from
place to place and is very different
in Australia now from what it was 30,
let alone 100, years ago. A formerly
censored book may later circulate
freely without raising any problem for
censors. Secondly, this view assumes
tolerance of most opposing moral atti-
tudes; it could be no basis for the com-
mon acts of censorship where some
group mounts a campaign against an
important book like “The Group”, not
because it is by the community’s stand-
ards outrageously vile, but because they
do not like its point of view or subject
matter. Any subject, from bestiality to
gas-chambers, is a fit subject provided
the vileness involved is not treated in
a gloating way that surrenders to it,
recommends it. In any case, it is not
concerned with conventional coarseness,
only with extreme publications, toler-
ance of which erodes a society’s integrity.
It is a matter of outrageousness not
offensiveness, of vileness not vulgarity.
One of the strong points of this line
of defence of censorship is that some
of the criticisms of the standard (“ten-
dency to corrupt”) defence do not touch
it. For example, the anti-censors claim
that censorship to protect readers from
corruption is rarely successful since
most banned books circulate fairly
freely on the black market; so why not
scrap the whole thing? This apparent
failure would not worry the declaratory
theory of censorship; the important
thing for it is not a wholly effective ban
but a public and, as it were, solemn
declaration that certain attitudes out-
rage our sense of civility. Provided the
declaration is made, it does not matter

too much if the book continues to cir-
culate clandestinely under a stigma. It
is more than a matter of enlightened
hyprocisy. One can compare this sort
of censorship with an occasional police
raid in a brothel; no one assumes this
will stamp out prostitution or make any
improvement in the community’s moral
tone; it is done simply because it is
thought to be a good thing that from
time to time the society should declare
its opposition to certain ways of life,
which may thereafter continue as usual,
under the stigma. Censors, on this
theory, need no more worry about a
“dirty-books market” than rational
moralists worry about brothels pro-
vided the community declares its pre-
judice against them. If people want to
buy a declared book or a prostitute, they
are free to do so in full awareness of
the stigma. It is to this sort of market
that pornographic classics like “Fanny
Hill” should be confined.
Similarly the inconsistency argument
(i.e., “if you want to stop people being
corrupted by reading why ban this but
not all these other books?”) need not
worry declaratory censors. They are
not primarily trying to stop individuals
being corrupted by reading, only to
declare from time to time the State's
support for community's basic preju-
dices.
There is one obvious objection to all
this the argument that a declaratory
censorship assumes there is something
agreed on to declare. But, it will be
said, what outrages one person's sense
of civility will only amuse another; and
there is no real consensus to form a
basis for declarations. This has a formal
plausibility, but, despite our disagree-
ment over moral values, is there not
also a basic consensus over ordinary
civilities and decencies which some pub-
lications outrage (Streicher-type racism;
recommendations of bestiality)?
We may disagree over the right to
fornicate, the right to dissolve marriages
and so on, but we do not disagree that
couples should be restrained, from
making sexual love outside Parliament as
a gesture of support for Love and of
protest against Repressive Morality.
Their right to disagree with, say, Christ-
ian, suburban or conventional morality
would not be in dispute, but their manner
of exercising their right would be pro-
perly restrained. The absence of a con-
sensus in morality does not mean there
is no consensus in civility.
The point at the moment about this
rationale of censorship is that it both
justifies a minima] censorship and leaves
no ground whatsoever for bans on books
like “The Group”. Mary McCarthy has
herself pointed out what any sensible
reader realises —that she wrote and re-
wrote the controversial chapters to
eliminate anything that would faintly
distract readers from her objective
critique of the influence of technology on
sexual life. The Victorian Vice Squad’s
action is a classic of yahoo censorship.
The problem, then, is how to reform
our censorship apparatus so that it is
solely declaratory and not merely re-
actionary and repressive. It seems to me,
despite some scandals, that there is no
call for any sweeping reforms. After the
disputes of the past few years, including
the High Court’s crack-down on the
Queensland Literature Board of Review
and Senator Henty’s reforms of Customs
censorship, the present arrangements
work fairly well. It is only over cases
like “The Group” that it breaks down.
It comes back again to the need for
publishers, booksellers, writers and
readers to develop the courage and get
into the habit of going to court to fight
acts of censorship instead of belly-
aching all the time. Imperfect as they
may be, juries are a representative organ
of public prejudices and can be a strong
check on busybody censorship bodies.
The trouble is that, unlike Americans
and the British, the Australians, with a
few exceptions, have been unwilling to
appeal to juries, to go to court to fight
for particular books.
If the Melbourne-based Freedom to
Read Association goes ahead with its
plan to contest the ban on “The
Group”, this precedent may be the best
thing to come out of the whole con-
troversy.


REVIEWS
MUSIC
Walton Reconsidered
Is consistency a virtue?
By JOHN SMALL
TTntil about the time of his knight-
hood in 1951, Sir William Walton
was regarded, at least by British critics,
as one of the foremost composers of his
time. His violin and viola concertos were
held to be works of the first rank, and
his First Symphony was referred to in
the most glowing terms by every critic
that discussed it. In recent years, how-
ever, Walton’s reputation has suffered a
decline. The earlier music is now re-
ferred to as “full of promise”, while his
later music is considered not to fulfil
that promise. In Hugh Wood's opinion,
“a mysterious, surely involuntary dis-
missal, earlier in his career, of the prob-
lems of 20th-century music, has the
result of all negative compromise—lack
of power.”
Whatever else may have changed in
Walton’s music, his style and outlook
have remained consistent throughout his
career, as was made clear at the tw'o
concerts of his own orchestral music
which he recently conducted in Sydney.
From the Viola Concerto (1929) to the
variations on a theme of Hindemith
(1963), Walton's musical idiom is mark-
ed by the same distinctive features—for
instance, the use of the interval of a
seventh as a key factor in melody and
harmony, the use of repetition of a
rhythmic or melodic motif to build up
to climaxes (which usually feature brass
chords), a rather Sibelius-like way of
handling more than one theme at a
time. In outlook, too, his mature music
is consistently expressive in a familiar
way; at its best, as in the Viola Concerto
or the First Symphony, it can rise to
great heights of rhetoric or lyricism.
It seems as though Walton’s consist-
ency is partly responsible for the present
critical disfavor towards him. His later
works are not modish, while his earlier
works, never very “advanced”, even
when they were written, have had the
misfortune to attain in some quarters
the status of classics before their com-
poser is decently dead. Wood’s criticism
seems to be motivated primarily by
these extra-musical considerations, apart
from embodying an erroneous theory
about what the relation between the
creative artist and his time must be.
There is, however, an important res-
pect in which Walton’s music has chang-
ed during his career. It can be seen in
the difference between the first move-
ments of his First and Second Sympho-
nies, written in 1934-35 and 1960
respectively. (Both of these movements
exhibit the mannerisms of style mention-
ed above.) The musical material used in
the later work is much more of a piece
than that of the latter —the whole move-
ment is constructed out of a few fairly
closely related basic ideas. The opening
movement of the First Symphony, how-
ever, proceeds by contrasting or com-
bining relatively heterogeneous material.
One could make the point by saying
that the First Symphony is conceived and
executed primarily in accord with ex-
pressive considerations, the second in
accord with formal; this would, of
course, be too neat a formulation, since
it is true neither that the First Symphony
is formless nor that form and content
can be profitably discussed in mutual
isolation. Nevertheless, it points to a
truth about Walton that the greater
formal cohesion of his later works has
been gained at the expense of expressive
power.
HPhis is not the whole truth, but it is
probably the most important factor in
Walton’s decline from the high stan-
dards his earlier works set. One can
confirm this by comparing the viola and
cello concertos, or the last movements
of the symphonies; the last movement
of the First Symphony is rather rambling,
one oft-repeated theme is quite trivial,
and the two fugatos are short-winded:
nevertheless, the movement generally
comes off, partly because of some im-
pressive and convincing gesturing,
partly because one of its themes is a
particularly fine one. But the last move-
ment of the Second Symphony, which
according to Walton is largely serial, is
oppressively dull.
The unsatisfactoriness of Walton's
later music (Wood is correct about this,
if about nothing else), is due not to any
kind of refusal to meet history's de-
mands, but to a fact about Walton’s
musical character. However, there is no
reason to say that the decline is perma-
nent. Walton is still at 62 an active
composer, and it is quite possible that
his future works will combine the best
elements of both periods of his work to
date. Even if this does not occur, Wal-
ton has still produced several works
which will survive when many of his
more prolific and up-to-date contempo-
raries are forgotten.

roles, and Keith Michell, who plays
nine. The idea behind it all is, we are
told, to offer homage to Shakespeare on
the occasion of the 400th anniversary
of his birth.
It is a mere reflex of conventional
piety to consider any such act of
homage necessary in the first place.
Milton asked the pertinent question
centuries ago:
“What needs my Shakespeare for his
honor’d bones?” The genius of a play-
wright is no more fairly exhibited in a
programme of bits and pieces from his
works, culminating in a forty-minute
abridgement of one of his master-
pieces, than would be the genius of a
composer in a similar programme. One
simply cannot conceive of a concert
consisting of a movement from each of
Beethoven’s first eight symphonies and
a selection of “highlights” from the
Ninth—and this is an over-fair analogy,
since most of the scenes presented here
are much less complete in themselves
than are the movements of Beethoven
symphonies. Some of these scenes, in
fact, are barely intelligible when divorc-
ed from their context. I would estimate
that about three-quarters of the point
of Rosalind's scene with Silvius and
Phebe (from “As You Like It") would
be missed by anyone who had not read
the play within the last six months. And
Shakespeare’s intention is often violently
distorted. The scissors have been used
on “Othello”, for example, in such a
way as to allow Emilia completely to


overshadow Othello, Desdemona and
Iago: Desdemona’s death is reduced to
the status of a mere incident, in order
that Emilia’s death may be given a
weight of significance which is utterly
unlike anything which attaches to it in
the scheme of Shakespeare’s play.
But the crowning outrage is the con-
densation of “Antony and Cleopatra”,
which, like all great plays, is an organic
whole. As presented here it is raucous
and incoherent on about the same
artistic level as the famous film. By
and large, this programme offers not
homage to Shakespeare, but an insult
to his genius.
There remain, then, the costumes
and, above all, the pleasures of virtuoso
acting. In thr nature of the case, there
is little room for genuine artistry (per-
haps only from Jeanette Sterke in her
few moments as Desdemona, and from
Keith Michell, in a teasingly brief indi-
cation of what he might do with Ham-
let if given the chance) but the level of
craftsmanship is very high indeed. Joan
MacArthur’s wonderful voice is given
full scope in her portrayal of Emilia.
Googie Withers, apart from a few habi-
tual movements of the head and should-
ers, and a few heavily melodramatic
vocal cadences, does as well as any
actress could to convince ,us that
she is seven different people in one even-
ing. Keith Michell is similarly im-
pressive in’ his mastery of the technical
difficulties of this night’s work but
to me he is still, most importantly, the
superb Hotspur he brought here in
1952.
rTtHE modern French, post-Christian view
of life (insofar as Anouilh’s play
represents it truly) is immeasurably
more pessimistic than the ancient Greek,
pre-Christian view (as represented by
Sophocles). Sophocles’ Antigone
chooses to die rather than co-operate in
a clearly perceived evil. Her death is
an affirmation of belief in the existence
of a moral order in her universe. And
she is not mistaken —there is such an
order in this universe, and its operation
vindicates Antigone and crushes Creon.
Thus Antigone is a martyr in the pre-
cise sense: she dies in order to uphold,
not a mere conscientious opinion, but
the very truth. In the universe of
Anouilh’s play, however, martyrdom is
inconceivable. “The very truth” has no
meaning here. Antigone’s passionate
conviction that it is wrong to deny
burial to Polynices is neither confirmed
nor denied by the order of things.
There is no “order of things”. This
universe is absurd.
If Anouilh is right, no reconciliation
is possible between Antigone and Creon
—between youth and maturity, inno-
cence and experience, the poetic and the
pragmatic. It is the fate of the one
to be destroyed by the other. The
morally sensitive individual has no home
here. He may, like Creon, survive by
acquiescing in the progressive deteriora-
tion of his sensitivity; or he may, like
Antigone, escape by suicide: but he may
not settle down. Only the morally neuter
may settle down —people like the guards:
• . none of this matters to them. It’s
no skin off their noses. They go on
playing cards.”
Whatever philosophic merits it may
have, this chilling view has serious
limitations as a basis for drama. It is
an esoteric view, spun out far beyond
its sources; and difficult to convey in
concrete terms. When, for example, in
Sophocles’ play, Creon enters with the
body of Haemon in his arms, and says:
“Behold the slayer, the slain,
The father, the son.”
the appalling thing is the depth and
clarity of his awfully-won insight into
the order he has outraged—and we need
no special sophistication to see this, and
be moved by it. Anouilh, generally
speaking, is not able to invest his con-
cepts with this kind of emotional force.
There is much splendidly vigorous writ-
ing (the superb passage of argument
between Antigone and Creon, for ex-
ample) but much of the vigor is peri-
pheral to the themes.
Both plays are presented with intelli-
gence and intensity. Lighting and sound
effects are imaginative, and the level of
acting is perhaps the highest I have yet
seen at Emerald Hill. Gerda Nicolson
as Sophocles’ Antigone, George Alcock
as Anouilh’s, and Terry Norris as Creon
in both plays, are all in the first class.
These productions are alternating, week
by week, until the middle of June.

Mocking the Gods

ward Albee. Old Tote Theatre.

Valency. Ensemble Theatre. Syd-
ney.
TjVEN if the brilliance of “Who’s
Afraid of Virginia Woolf?” (herein
after referred to as “Who’s Afraid?”)
has faded mostly by the following day,
it is still the sort of brilliance you must
not miss. In front of your eyes, ladies
and gentlemen, absolutely no deception,
nothing (but nothing!) concealed, play-
wright Edward Albee cuts the clothes
and living flesh off four civilised people.
One married couple is paying a late-
night visit to another, and in a wonder-
ful fug of many drinks and more words
the host couple first lay bare their
selves, and then cut up the visitors.
The host couple are brilliant fighters,
with most of their punches low and
deadly. Their blows dance in and out,
narrowly missing the incessant drinks,
making up a pattern of mutual abuse
that soon reveals itself as an elaborate
game, a game that is their one defence
against life and each other. They mock
life, and their living of it; they mock
the gods that stand behind this life.
Husband and wife are obviously frus-
trated, she because they have no child-
ren, he because lesser men have passed
him on the academic ladder. They
attack each other for these faults, but
the attacking is just this grand game.
There is, the end of the play shows, a
special tenderness for each other, a
special satisfaction, a particular care
that this husband has for this wife, and
(despite her compulsive unfaithfulnesses)
that this wife has for this husband too.
The visiting couple are different, with
different secrets. They can have child-
ren but the wife is scared of the notion.
After being vivisected by the host and
hostess, after the visiting man has (un-
successfully) played one of the evening's
“games”, called “Hump the Hostess”,
the visiting woman sheds her fears, and
wistfully reconciles herself to some
future baby.
So Mr Albee is not all venom. Be-
hind it there looms a sympathy that any
world should become so strange as to
have such people in it. He has not yet
the skill, the deadliness of a Strindberg,
with which to fix all the horror in one
cold crystal which chills forever.
The Albee display ceases with the
curtain, but while it is on it demands
the utmost attention, and utmost tech-
nical respect for the whip and crackle
of his repartee. So far, his long
speeches do not hold up as well as the
short exchanges, but plainly this is a
playwright of great powers.
Mr John Clark’s production is as
honest and daring as the play. He has
fused in his actors an integrity of per-
formance that carries the innocence of
conviction into some scenes that the
least hint o ; self-consciousness would
have made embarrassing, if not objec-
tionable.
Players Mr Alexander Hay, Miss
Jacqueline Kott, and Mr Kevin Miles
give performances of eerie intensity, so
engrossed that it is a pleasure to see
them alive and well at the curtain call.
Of the four, only Miss Wendy Black-
lock is not up to her role. I admire
Miss Blacklock’s evident determination
to play it straight after so many ex-
periences as a funny-voiced comedienne
in revue.
At the Ensemble, Mr Hayes Gordon
has given us a crazy romp of an even-
ing, which in its ways casts some dis-
turbing doubts on solid virtues. Valency
takes the Alcestis-Admetus legend
apart at the seams, and shows Alcestis

with the Queen’s Birthday Weekend. Four other
theatres will screen simultaneously over the two
weekends of June 5-7 and 13-15.
Highlights promised to the Festival include An
Autumn Afternoon (a lovingly malicious look at
modern Japan, and the last film of the late
Yasujiro Ozu), Hands Over the City (Italy; Rod
Steiger plays the lead in this winner of the
Golden Lion Award, Venice Festival), The
Siberian Lady Macbeth (Yugoslavia), The Exiles

not as the wholly noble wife who gave
her life so as her husband might live,
but as a deceitful faggot jealous of her
husband’s glory. Her death was an
attempt to steal his glory by eclipsing
it.
Maurice Valency’s play takes up the
Alcestis story at a witty point the
moments after she is restored to her
husband by the gods, highly touched by
her wifely sacrifice.
Mr Gordon’s direction falters occa-
sionally, mainly because he has not been
able to draw together a cast which is
consistently as richly-endowed as his
principals. Nevertheless, Mr Reginald
Livermore as Admetus gives a highly
inventive and powerful turn to the
shadowy king of legend, and Mr Arthur
Payton makes Heracles an endearingly
stupid muscle-nut of the heroic age.
Miss Darlene Johnston does well
with the hard job of making Alcestis
about face, though at present her soft
original wife has a better presentation
than the bitch she becomes on restora-
tion.

ART
Simmering Cauldron
Michener Collection. Art Gallery of
N.S.W.
Speculation as to the nature of paint-
ings reproduced in American art mags
can now give way to the real thing. A
long, close look at 40 from the Allentown
Museum’s Michener Collection reveals a
fair survey of some US trends. Pollock,
Rothko, De Kooning, Still Gotlieb, New-
man are not there for various reasons,
but others almost as well known are.
As a whole the collection is remarkably
consistent, though Graves, Francis, Hut-
berg, Knaths, Vincente and perhaps
Kline have produced very much more
outstanding works. Conrad Marca-Relli
is represented by an ingratiating collage-
painting entitled “The Conversion”, and
he is probably shown to advantage. Like-
wise the Joan Mitchell appears pre-
eminent among “soft edge” abstractions.
Space, treated in a dozen, often elusive
forms, is a major occupation. We have
grown used to large extrovert formats,
but a whole exhibition of Whitmanesque
exuberance still has punch here. A same-
ness of pitch reflects a mutual triggering
of painterly impulse and one can imagine
the whole New York school advancing
along one front through a thousand
minor explorations. Some of the “hard
edge” faction, despite beautiful craft,
fine color sense, neat borders, appear to
raise ordinary layout principles to the
demands of the big canvas. Indeed very
few paintings in the show tend to deepen
the first, sometimes big, impact. The
Jimmy Ernest is almost anachronistically
European in concept; the American
Dionysius is physically alert, energetic,
expansive, inventive, if somewhat neuro-
tic and materialistic. A European convert
like the distinguished teacher Hans Hof-
mann remains a Blau Reiter, and a highly
intuitive one at that.
Even pop has its puritannical severity.
James Dine’s “Four Coats”, despite but-
tons, becomes swallowed into a cleverly
realised, sombre, architectural formalism.
Harold Stevenson’s “Arm of Don Juan”
evokes a claustrophobic sense of physical
repulsion. Spatial ambiguities underline
the quality of George Ortman’s occult
puzzle, “The Good Life/’ the symbols of
which create a surreal rather than a uni-
versal frame of reference. With Rivers,
Richenburg, Guston, Calcagno no doubt
remains as to the prospect of developing
US romantic-expressionist tendencies.
The late William Baziotes achieved a
convincing self-enclosed marine universe
couched in terms of subtle color empathy.
Yes, the cauldron simmers over in the
US. We may not desire to see a whole-
sale conversion of Australian painters as
a result of seeing the Michener show, but
there exists a solid professionalism of
which we might be envious, and a linger-
ing expectancy that one day a real genius
will make the pot boil over.

POETRY
Images in Season
1 MOVEMENT IN SPRING
Morning on Limestone Hill.
The traffic softens at the shade of trees
though each car, texture of its restlessness,
reflects the light still, moving quickly,
and there are important destinations.
The road is a bait we all swallow,
with its turnings and its promises;
yet a moment blends the cars with shade
and there under the simple itineraries of trees
people with their road-maps calculating miles and
gallons
glance up and exclaim to see
new foliage celebrating all live branches.
But the car-windows are wound well up;
there is no time to stop, for it is a long journey.
2 SUMMER PLAYGROUND
Though the swings are sly burn to touch
and the open yard they call a Playground squints
as hard as bottles,
and though rock bruises heels mockingly,
the game of moving, trying, doing, makes him still
friend of a good company, boss of the smooth toys,
workman proud of the craft in his hands.
The sun does not blister him at all, he knows.
This street, next street, the sun is uprooting shadows;
Here in the lacerated city
hard nails cry out, bare splinters yield from wood.
“Look” cries the boy, and the practised metal
applauds;
He laughs and proves his skill with another turn.
The sun squats in the swings when he has gone.
3 AUTUMN AND SINGING
Autumn and singing, April and lingering among
shadows
with fruit and with paddocks become meadows,
and I, who live in the town
and measure years only by income tax returns,
am simple enough to be glad
because of the shaping of taut air
and all good weather;
autumn and April lingering like singing.
Then because of this richer
turn in the returning year
I walk in the crowd out of Woolworths
and see everyone moving and themselves and
bonded to Autumn
and who’s to say this is not a way of believing?
Who can plunder further meanings than singing?
4 PARK ORATOR IN WINTER
In a time of year when it seems easiest to be com-
panionable
when the sun is not strident in accusation
and even the shadows underline shapes of things,
he stands awkwardly and apart in the park
(pigeons and dawdling papers)
and he furies at the plight of Mankind
and looks around him with anger at these con-
spiracies of men.
In his sight the park contains decades of idleness
the people are sinners to be admonished.
“What do you know? I will tell you the right words”
he cries
and the idlers walk easily and undisturbed among
pigeons.
The sun is tilting the park already into the cold
moments.
It will be chill tonight: there are no right words.
He packs his things and joins the others at the bus-
stop.
THOMAS W. SHAPCOTT
The Rape of Europa
Beautiful Europa, while the billy boils
Underneath the she-oaks, underneath the willows,
Underneath the sky like a bent bow of silver,
Like the arms of a god embracing a mortal—
Beautiful Europa has set out a picnic.
All her father’s paddocks that slope to the water
Are singing with runnels and freshets of crystal
And the voice of the river is loud as it plunges
By boulders of granite and shouldering basalt —•
On a spit of white sand she is boiling the billy.
The cattle come down to the sand by the river,
Europa is plaiting green willows and buttercups,
Daisies and water-weeds: mocking, she crowns them
With wreaths and festoons, with dripping green
garlands,
And climbs to the back of the dark one, the leader.
Europa, Europa, the billy is boiling,
Down from the wool-sheds your brothers come
riding.
There’s a splash in the shallows, a swirl, a
commotion,
He has leapt, he is swept in the rush of the current,
And the riders draw rein on the hillside, astounded.
Oh wave to Europa for far she is faring
Past farmyard and homestead, past township and
jetty,
And many will say that they saw them go riding,
The girl and the bull on the back of the river
Down to the harbour and over the ocean.
And distant indeed are the coasts of that country
Where the god was revealed in splendour and ardour.
Europa, Europa, as you lay quiet
In sunshine and shadow, under a plane-tree,
Did you remember the river, the she-oaks?
ROSEMARY DOBSON
Seven: Bluestocking
And this is another one
Of the same species
But not the same curriculum.
She cries out to you above
The clamour of her discipline
Till her lips are glistening wet,
And her shins are barked
From stumbling against professorial chairs.
She is still awed
By parochial eyes, which,
If not seeing her full stature,
See as least her urgency
To even the score.
There is a glut of minds.

Jenkins in the Phoney War
Powell’s recessive hero
By BERNARD BERGONZI
The Valley of Bones. Anthony Powell.
Heinemann. 225. 6d.
/Ane of the most interesting things
about post-war British fiction is the
way in which a number of novelists in
the over-50 age-group have turned their
attention to the novel in several parts,
and in some cases to the roman fleuve
of really exacting length. It is as if the
accumulated experience of several de-
cades needs a spacious form in order to
be properly articulated; the trend is all
the more remarkable since it cuts right
across the opposite tendency for ordinary
run-of-the-mill novels to get shorter and
shorter. Thus, Evelyn Waugh’s major
fictional achievement since the war seems
to me to be his trilogy about Army life,
“The Sword of Honor,” the composition
of which extended over a period of
nine years, from 1952 to 1961. Lawrence
Durrell's “Alexandria Quartet” is another
substantial work, though, for me, a dis-
tinctly inflated one: it is significant that
critical opinion was rather cool when
the whole work was reprinted in one
volume a year or so ago, as compared
with the somewhat premature rhapso-
dies that had greeted the appearance
of each of the constituent books.
Amongst the longer sequences, there are
such works as Henry Williamson’s “A
Chronicle of Ancient Sunlight”, which
has now reached its eleventh volume and
is still going strong; and C. P. Snow’s
“Strangers and Brothers”, started as long
ago as 1940 and now up to eight vol-
umes, though nothing has appeared since
“The Affair” came out four years ago. (I
believe another one is on the way, how-
ever.)
My own favorite amongst these
leisurely productions is another unfinish-
ed sequence, Anthony Powell’s “The
Music of Time”, of which the first vol-
ume, “A Question of Upbringing”, came
cut in 1951 and the seventh, “The Val-
ley of Bones”, has just appeared. “The
Music of Time” is a vast work which has
been planned with almost mathematical
exactness; Anthony Powell intends that it
should be complete in 12 volumes, made
up of four constituent trilogies; since he
publishes a volume about once every two
years one can hope that the whole work
will be completed, barring accidents, in
1974. Only a novelist with immense con-
fidence in his creative powers and intel-
lectual stamina, it seems to me, could
give up so much of his life to such a
huge undertaking.
In one respect, “The Music of Time”
is a deceptively simple work; it is based
on a straightforward autobiographical
plan, in which we follow the mild but
perceptive hero, Nicholas Jenkins, in his
journey through life from school (Eton,
though not in fact named) in 1921, then
to Oxford (again unnamed), and on
into the higher bohemia and sub-aristo-
cratic circles of London in the twenties
and thirties, where he dabbles in pub-
lishing, film-making and authorship;
when we last hear of Jenkins, at the end
of “The Valley of Bones”, he is a rather
over-age subaltern in Northern Ireland
in 1940, waiting for the war to sweep
him up. Jenkins, as many critics have
observed, is a somewhat recessive hero;
he is self-effacing to a remarkable degree
and he tells the reader only enough about
himself to permit his tangibility to be
taken for granted. But the real interest
is in what and particularly who
Jenkins sees. For in “The Music of
Time” Powell provides certain rather
old-fashioned literary satisfactions: his
major ability lies in the creation of
characters, often of a grotesque kind, but
all magnificently realised and memor-
able: this is a quality the Victorians
would have instantly responded to, but
which the modern reader tends to be
suspicious of, rather to his disadvantage,
I feel. Furthermore, “The Music of
Time” provides something of the tapestry
effect of a romance epic; its imaginative
world is wholly self-consistent, and much
of the pleasure comes from seeing the
pattern that the characters make as they
weave in and out of the narrative over
the course of several volumes; it is the
kind of pleasure claimed, for instance,
by dedicated readers of the “Faerie
Queen”.
fpHE tapestry effect of Powell’s novel
—and “The Music of Time” unques-
tionably needs to be read as one long
novel —is not a mere imposed piece of
patterning. It is still a fact about English
metropolitan upper-middle-class society
that most people know each other, or
at least know of each other (and this
was probably truer still in the twenties
and thirties): contact between a great
many people in different social or pro-
fessional circles is preserved by a large
network of friends, or friends of friends,
and few people are lost sight of alto-
gether. Powell's fictional world reflects
this cohesiveness. But at the same time
its dimensions are subtly distorted so as
to bring out the latent absurdity of its
many inhabitants and the kind of situa-
tions in which they habitually find them-
selves. Powell’s vision, as expressed in
Jenkins’ calm, unemphatic observations,
is radically comic, and it finds its fullest
expression in a superb series of absurd
but compelling characters: Jenkins’s
shady Uncle Giles, for instance, or the
retired General Conyers, who takes up
psychoanalysis very seriously at the age
of 80. And above all, in Widmerpool,
the presiding genius of “The Music of
Time”, who is obtuse, pompous, un-
gainly, and at the same time possessed
a kind of demonic energy and an un-
stoppable urge to succeed (he is generally
acknowledged to be based on a fairly-
well-known Conservative politician). We
first meet Widmerpool, as a boy at school,
in “A Question of Upbringing" looming
portentously out of the mist in running
kit: at the end of “The Valley of Bones”
Jenkins discovers him in the uniform of
an Army major, as self-possessed as ever
and intent on rising rapidly in the mili-
tary hierarchy.
In “The Valley of Bones” Jenkins is
removed by war from his familiar sur-
roundings: Soho and Mayfair and
country houses in the Home Counties.
Given an emergency commission, he
finds himself during the phoney war of
1939-40 in a predominantly Welsh regi-
ment, first in South Wales and then in
a singularly bleak encampment in North-
ern Ireland. Although the sequence is so
far advanced, Mr Powell shows himself
fully up to the business of providing
further rich and fascinating characters.
In particular, Jenkins, and the reader,
is deeply absorbed in a certain Captain
Rowland Gwatkin, a Welsh bank-clerk
in peace-time, who now holds a Terri-
torial commission. Gwatkin is in some
respects an admirable soldier, but his
dreams of military glory are matched by
a corresponding and disastrous lack
of contact with everyday reality, which
leads Gwatkin to a sad but foreseeable
fall from grace. “The Valley of Bones”
is a crisply written book, with a good
deal of underplayed but accurate dia-
logue: the rather leisurely passages of
reflective and descriptive writing which
annoyed some readers of the earlier
volumes (unreasonably, I think; what
about James or Proust?) are now less in
evidence. I found it a splendidly enter-
taining novel, though with a darker side,
for the war is already removing some of
Jenkins’ old acquaintances, and doubt-
less others will disappear. It offers clear
evidence that after 13 years’ work on
“The Music of Time” Powell's inventive-
ness is as abundant as ever.


After the Flood

borough. Lutterworth Press. 21s.
Farewell to Old England. Hugh
Anderson. Rigby. 375. 6d.
A very few years ago it was hard to
find new books about Australian
subjects. Now they pour out in a flood.
The latest batch are better than the
average. Some of the new Australian
works are excellent in their genre, like
K. A. Austin's “The Voyage of the In-
vestigator 1801-3”, well-printed by
Rigby of Adelaide. It is a roughly-
-70,000-word summary and explanation
of the famous voyage of circumnaviga-
tion of Australia. Not being an expert
on naval exploration I forbear to esti-
mate it for accuracy, though there is
room for disagreement with such state-
ments by the author as that it was
Flinders who “established the name of
the continent”, which he did not,
though he used it as did the compiler
of “Purchas His Pilgrimes” in 1625.
There is evidence it was in common
colloquial use in New South Wales be-
fore Flinders’ book was issued.
Generally, however, the book appears
to be a sincere attempt to epitomise
the facts about the voyage in a plain
narrative and to document it.
A sound, full biography of Flinders is
still needed to replace the unsatisfactory
one by Ernest Scott, who wrote without
flair for the work or access to the ample
documentation now available.
In the field of geography, Hans
Mincham’s “Story of the Flinders
Ranges” gives a splendid picture of that
ancient formation which most passers-by
knew only a few years ago as a dreary
waste of rock and timber at close
quarters and an enchanting vision of
richly colored profiles from afar. Much
more than a tourist guide, it is readable,
knowledgeable and comprehensive.
Photographs are the feature of
“Quest Under Capricorn”, by David
Attenborough, which is described in the
blurb as an account of an expedition
through “desolate and fascinating
country” in the Northern Territory.
Over most of this “desolate and fasci-
nating” country I took my wife in a
hired car from Mt Isa in 1946 in what
seemed extreme comfort after much
earlier journeys when the Barkly and
the Gulf and Roper country were still
remote and without kerosene refrigera-
tors, pedal wireless, bitumen on the
main stretches and abundant wells. But
today Mr Attenborough is still a little
breathless about his “expedition” and
has re-photographed the country and its
fourth generation of odd-bods and
civil servants, many of them only too
eager to inform the stranger out of an
all-too-limited knowledge.
Still the story is instructive as showing
how initiation ceremonies and pseudo-
Aboriginal painting have become part of
the tourist industry with a new genera-
tion of savages always willing to remove
their trousers, paint their chests and
make a noise with a bull-roarer to
oblige the inquisitive “expeditionary”.
The last book in this all-Australian
batch is Mr Hugh Anderson’s “Farewell
to Old England” which he describes as
“a broadside history of early Australia”.
It is an entertaining little volume of
fifty songs and “Come all ye-s”, not all
of Australian origin, interspersed with
extracts from early books and letters
which certainly were not broadsides. It
is an amusing book to browse in; but
it suffers from a serious primary fault:
Much of the prose matter which forms
the bulk of it is not dated and the
authorship of a lot of it is not stated.
M. H. ELLIS
Banjo Paterson’s
Horse?
Modern Australian Verse. Volume 11.
Edited by Douglas Stewart. Angus
& Robertson. 30s.
T)art of the value of this collection lies
in its recognition of young poets
who have started to make their mark
since, say, the appearance of “The Pen-
guin Book of Australian Verse” in 1958.
It includes such pieces as Bruce Beav-
er’s “Cow Dance”, Judith Green’s “The
Bush-Fiddle”, or Geoffrey Lehmann’s
“The Last Campaign”. Of all the re-
cently arrived (or still arriving) writers,
perhaps the strongest is Gwen Harwood.
(It is a pity that two out of the three of
her poems included in this anthology are
from the “Professor Eisenbart” series,
which does not represent her at her
strongest or most individual.)
Another pleasing feature is the re-
discovery of certain poets. I am think-
ing, for example, of the extract from
Furnley Maurice’s “The Victorian
Markets Recollected in Tranquillity”.
The jaunty, still invigorating jovialism of
these lines goes some way to vindicating
Stewart’s judgment that in the “Mel-
bourne Odes” “Australian poetry burst
with a vengeance into the urban world
of the twentieth century”. Or there is
W. S. Fairbridge's fine “Consecration
of the House”. Or Kenneth Mackenzie,
amply (and properly) represented by six
of his poems.
Stewart has further contributed to one
of the tasks of all anthologists—the
establishing, through selection or rejec-
tion, of the poetic touchstones of a place
and time. By reprinting certain poems
which have appeared again and again in
anthologies, he confirms their centrality.
It would probably be possible by now to
compile a list of some two dozen poems
by which the genuine, imaginative
achievement of modern Australian verse
is to be measured. There would be
Kenneth Slessor's “Five Bells” and
“Beach Burial”; R. D. Fitzgerald’s “The
Face of the Waters” and “The Wind at
Your Door”; A. D. Hope’s “The Death
of the Bird” and “An Epistle”; James
McAuley’s “New Guinea”; Judith
Wright’s “South of My Days” and
“Woman to Man”. All of these appear
in Mr Stewart's collection. Among
other poems in the volume which are
forcing their way into the charmed circle
are John Manifold’s “The Tomb of Lt
John Learmonth, AIF”, Max Harris’
“The Tantanoola Tiger”, Vincent Buck-
ley’s “Late Tutorial”, J. R. Rowland’s
“Canberra in April”, and David Camp-
bell's “Night Sowing”.
By their excellence, poems such as
these remove themselves from the claims
of nationality and editorial taste. It is
through his selection of good but not
great verse that an editor is most likely
to impress the stamp of his own person-
ality on his book. Anybody, however,
who looks for a continuation of that
“new Bulletin school” of nature poets
that Vincent Buckley thought he detect-
ed during Douglas Stewart’s reign at the
Red Page is in for a disappointment.
Mr Stewart’s fundamental principle of
selection, as he tells us in his Introduc-
tion, was quite a simple one—whether
or not he found a poem enjoyable. And
the joy that he seems to seek most from
poetry does not, at heart, have anything
to do with Nature or with Man or with
the relation between Nature and Man.
Mr Stewart finds his principal joy in the
melody of verse. His own “The Snow-
Gum” might stand as an exemplar of
the kind of poem that gives “Modern
Australian Verse” its special flavor: a
brief, lyric statement, based on an evo-
cative rhythm and kept within the for-
mal bounds of a short line and (often)
half-rhyme. Among the best practition-
ers of such seemingly unforced verse
are David Campbell, Geoffrey Dutton,
Rosemary DobsOn and Thomas W.
Shapcott. Much pleasure can also be
derived from poems in the same mode
by Robert Clark, Flexmore Hudson and
Nancy Keesing.
Whether or not they constitute a
dominant mode in current Australian
writing or merely reflect the bias of the
editor's taste, I am not sure. But it
can be said that Stewart’s admitted pre-
ference for a certain kind of poetry has
led to a surprisingly limited representa

Hope and James McAuley; and one sus-
pects that there are other poets of a
poised, satiric urbanity who might have
found a place along with, say, John
Thompson and Peter Porter. On the
other hand, Mr Stewart has printed so
much good verse of the kind he most
immediately admires that one cannot
deny it a significant (if not dominant)
place in our writing.
It may be that Banjo Paterson, the
centenary of whose birth is being cele-

legacy, not so much galloping horses and
dashing horsemen as the need to trans-
form his insistent jingles into the subtle

these publications are the pro-
ducts of a younger post-war genera-
tion. Australia has seen nothing like
the fury that most younger English
writers have directed against their
elders, but the absence of such open
rivalries does not make the gap of
the generations here any less great.
“Dissent” (circulation 4000) is a
world away from the Leftism of the
19305. In the current ssue a review by
co-editor Peter Samuel of Dr J. Cairns’
pamphlet “Socialism and the ALP”,
under the heading of “Cairns’ Dream-
world”, could rate as a paradigm of the
difference between generations. Samuel
describes the pamphlet as “clumsily
written, often vague and obscure,
cliche-ridden and sometimes meaning-
less”. He scorns Cairns’ refuge in ide-
ology and his “mixture of utopianism
and crude historical materialism”.
The other co-editor of the magazine,
Leon Glezer, evens the score by a
sharp and justified criticism of “News-
Weekly” for its attitude over the affair
of Utashi Croats. As Mr Glezer com-
ments: “The familiar and fatuous rea-
soning is apparently that since the
Communists are attacking them (ie, the
Croat Fascists) these people have right
°a their side whatever their ‘trim-
mmgs’. This type of anti-Communism
We can do without.”
‘Prospect” (circulation 1500) is a
l° n g way from the ghetto Catholic
Church in Australia in the 19305, with
Its hearty Chester-Belloc complacency
its unquestioned Papal Encylicals.
. ow that the Vatican Council has made
]Ust about everyone a liberal, it is too
easy to forget what a revolution “Pros-
pect” symbolised when it first appeared
six years ago.
Its range of interests has never been
narrowly Catholic. In the current issue,
for example, the editorials discuss
Poverty in the United States and the
“Opening to the Left” in Italy.
Dr Knopfelmacher writes acutely on
Max Weber and shows how much our
understanding of totalitarianism derives
from Weber's theories of disenchantment,
bureaucracy and charisma, although
Weber died before full-blow totalitarian
movements emerged. There is a review
from Bob Burns (author of “Mr Brain”)
on recent Australian novels, regretting
the influence on them of Patrick White;
an article by Norman Fisher on New
Guinea education (“Too Little, Too
Late?”); and a review by Julian Tol-
hurst on the failure of the Church’s
mission in big cities. There is also an
outstanding article on the implications
of R. Bultmann’s demythologising of the
New Testament. There are seven poems
by The Bulletin’s poetry editor, R. A.
Simpson.
The third organ of the new generation,
“Crux” (circulation 1600), is Protestant.
Published by the Australian Student
Christian Movement, it devotes almost
all the current issue to Protestant-
Catholic relations. There is some plain
speaking from a Catholic university
chaplain, Fr Donatus, who accuses Pro-
testants of “lowering the Honors stan-
dard and abolishing the Pass”, in reli-
gion. The editorial and an article by
Paul Tillich take up honestly the ques-
tion of ultimate authority, the stumbling
block to Christian unity. However, the
plain bad lay-out of the issue is annoy-
ing.

of Polish explorers and migrants in Aus-

Polish fleet in Australia to aid the Polish
Insurrection against Russia in 1863 (as

BUSINESS AND FINANCE
No Sign of Fever in the US
long-anticipated tax cut in the US finally went into full
A operation in March and the statisticians licked their
pencils nervously while they waited for the effect to filter
through. The result was an anti-climax. Retail sales actually
fell and March statistics showed a few weak patches in indus-
try, notably a tapering-off in orders.
The Federal Reserve Board and the Administration were
pleased with the result. The inflationary spiral (expected by
those who complained that the tax cut, plus a continuance
of easy money, would be too great a stimulus) did not com-
mence spiralling. Don't worry ... it will come, said others,
as they warned of the multiplier effect on the economy.
But the injection into the veins of the US economy has
done nothing so far but create a condition of well being. The
serum labelled “stimulus” may turn out to be nothing more
than a truth drug, confirming
last year’s fears that, without
a tax cut, the US would have
entered a recession in 1964.
So far, conditions have
worked out very well for the
Administration, because it
wants the existing prosperity
to be maintained at least until
the elections this year, but
without the disadvantages of
wage and cost inflation.
Assisting this situation is
the still-stubborn unemploy-
ment level, which remains up
near the 6 p.c. mark and is
not expected to drop to 5 p.c.
until the end of the year.
There is no doubt that the
Federal Reserve Board is
watching the situation closely
and will step in with some
form of restraint when neces-
sary, just as the Reserve Bank
in Australia recently moved
quickly to anticipate any quickening of the pulse rate. But,
with a high level of unemployment in the US, the Federal
Reserve Board is mindful of earlier criticisms that, if it had
not been so zealous in its restraints on previous occasions,
the unemployment level would not have remained so chroni-
cally tied to the 5.5 p.c. average since 1958.
While Wall Street investors may ask themselves if stock
Market prices were over-enthusiastic in anticipating a boom,
there are still plenty of ingredients which encourage their
confidence; namely, the Administration’s averred programme
stimulating expansion. Concrete evidence of rising order

achieving its object and undoubtedly touch off a renewed
wave of enthusiasm which, indeed, would invite restraints.
Meanwhile, there is a nagging doubt that the boom may
have been over-anticipated.
Interest Rates Puzzle Share
And Money Markets
VX/ r riting on the eve of announcement of the May Com-
” monwealth Loan, it looks patent that both money and
share markets are behaving rather tremulously. A rise in
short-term rates has been widely accepted as inevitable,
almost every major yield factor pointing that way.
The long-term bond rate,
however, is being subject to
considerable guesswork.
Successful prediction does
not become any the easier
when the Reserve Bank inter-
venes throughout the open
market, even if its selling
operations still seem largely
dictated by general liquidity
conditions. Technical interest
relationships must clearly pre-
dominate for the loan.
The immediate effect,
though, is to push up the lon-
ger-dated yields while some
economists and businessmen
are beginning to think
that the tighter money
policy has gone just about far
enough. They fear the Trea-
surer may indulge himself by
merely following the market
pattern which he has had a
part in creating.
So business preference would hope for retention of a
4} p.c. long-term rate, cheering itself by reading this possi-
bility into the relatively cheap 6}-6} p.c. offered by ICIANZ’s
£6 million unsecured note issue. After all, the issue seems
master-minded by Sir lan Potter, who last year gave correct
notice of lower borrowing rates through the medium of semi-
Government underwritings.
The private financial sector (including the sharemarket)
has not yet grown completely at home in the heady atmos-
phere of flexible interest rates now conditioning much offical
regulatory policy. Natural hesitancies on the loan leave
their marks upon money-market and share dealings.
Digestion of the latest rises in overdraft charges and
trading bank and savings bank deposit rates is also barely


under way. But flexibility henceforward should be accepted
as part of the facts of life, in the present upward phase
entirely disassociated from the punitive notion of “credit
squeeze".
Dr Coombs served due notice of thorough application of
this controlling method in the 1963 Reserve Bank report.
There, too, was a warning of the watchful official eye to be
kept on the growth of asset values. “A flexible policy which
responded readily . . . could help obviate the need for
wider and more restrictive policy measures”, the governor
remarked.
In the event, equity investors are fraught with as much
temporary puzzlement as anybody else. The current share-
market droop is extensively put forward in evidence.
Many outside factors flow between an exact correlation
of share prices and interest rates. The trends since 1962
are illustrated by the accompanying graph, which opposes
the Sydney ordinary share index and three relevant bank
interest charges.
Some experienced observers feel inclined to ascribe most
of the recent index drift to seasonal elements, conferring
upon the monetary hardening a comparatively minor
influence.
Certainly quite a few years past have disclosed a forward
index rush in lanuary and February, leading to a March-
April reaction. As the “all ordinaries” stands now, it is
only about three points above its opening 1964 position.
The gain can be completely attributed to the continuous
liveliness of base metals.
Of the other main sectional index classifications, pastorals
alone manage to nudge ahead of lanuary levels.
Such market sensitivity to the actual performance of
separate industrial sectors need not be condemned, nor the
fundamental market steadiness impugned. The prevailing
moderation can take the interest-rate climate in its stride,
leaving plenty of opportunity for informed selectivity.
Warming to the Blanket
Export Trade
A lthough the Australian blanket manufacturing industry
is a fairly stable one, competition from overseas has
been growing steadily in the last few years and from the
general acceptance of electric blankets as an everyday
possession. While some manufacturers have moaned about
this situation, others have tackled the problem aggressively.
One of their best moves has been to start exporting them-
selves. During 1962-63, our blanket exports took a sizeable
jump from a value of £66,000 in 1961-62 to £89,000.
Unfortunately the imports also scored a sizeable gain from
£59,000 to £BO,OOO. Our two main buyers last year were
New Guinea and Hong Kong. Most imports came from
the UK.
The export drive looks like intensifying. The latest move is
an overseas trip by Mr Leon Kozica, managing director of
Invicta Mills, a family company. His task is to study blanket
fashions and extend Invicta’s already sizeable export sales.
These sales are currently accounting for between 74 and 10 p.c.
of the total turnover.
One of the best targets is apparently the big international
hotels. Invicta, for example, is at present selling to two in
Hong Kong, one in Kuala Lumpur (Malaysia) and one in
Frankfurt (Germany). In addition, it also supplies distributors
in other parts of Malaysia and in Japan and Africa.
Of course, the advantage of aiming at the hotels is that
they provide a much steadier and more predictable market
than the normal export outlets. Moreover, the links between
different hotels in various countries can often lead to new
orders from the associates of the existing customer.
Dividend Mix-up Over
Westralian Oil
IIfESTRALiAN Oil shares reached their highest peak for
" several years after a daily paper had attributed the direc-
tors with saying that a maiden dividend could possibly be paid
this year. The scrip touched 3s. 2d. the day before the same
paper announced it had received a telegram from Mr E. S.
Watt, the company’s chairman, denying any such statement.
His telegram said the article was misleading and that no
director had made the announcement as published. Moreover,
he said, there was no possibility of a dividend this year. The
shares promptly slipped back to 2s. lOd. which is a pretty fair
short-term value if no payout will be forthcoming this year.
However, this price is a very tempting one at which to
buy because chances of a dividend in 1964-65 are very high,
Last year, the losses of 1961 and 1962 were converted to a
profit of £102,000. This result equalled an earning rate of
11.1 p.c., and reduced accumulated losses to less than £2OOO,
This year’s effort was expected to be much better than this,
but flooding at the Yoganup mines caused severe setbacks in
the December half year.
If seasonal factors do not hinder the proceedings in 1964-
65 then the performance could well be better than last year. If
it is, a 10 p.c. dividend would be quite liberally covered,
These factors make the stock look attractive at present prices,
especially as it is fully paid (25.) and shareholders do not have
the threat of a call hanging over their heads.
Westralian is probably a stock to buy and put away for
a couple of years.
Cuba Tries To Sweeten
Sugar Prices
JDising sugar prices have caused more than a feverish
demand to plant higher crops. They have attracted
eager commodity speculators, some of whom were caughl
when prices soared and fell back again.
Spectulation has extended to a national level and Cuba
is accused by US Government sugar experts of trying to
manipulate prices so as to cash in with its 1964 crop.
With Cuba's sugar supplies rejected by the US, then
devastated by hurricane, sugar markets became completely
upset last year, especially when European sugar beet crops
also suffered from severe weather. Since then, sugar pro-
ducers have been planting extra acreages to cash in on buoy-
ant world prices, but the market has fluctuated widely while
growers impatiently wait to harvest the new crops.
Cuba has been accused of attempting to rig prices by
purchasing 20,000 tons of sugar in Western Europe in “tran-
sparently phoney deals'’ while giving out false rumors that
the Cuban harvest would fall below last year's crop of 3.7
million tons. US experts claim that Cuba's 1964 harvest
could, in fact, rise above 4 million tons and that she is trying
to create artificial prices.
If other producers achieve higher output this year, the
question arises whether the market will be able to absorb
the extra quantities at high prices, despite statistical evidence
that world demand is growing rapidly.
Apart from sugar, the US evidently is intent on showing
that it knows what goes on in Cuba and, following the report
in April that the last of the Soviet troops was leaving Cuba,
Uncle Sam told Cuba it would continue to make air recon-
naissance over Cuban territory, despite Cuban objections.
The tough line on inspection is described by Dr Castro as
intolerable. But the Americans are convinced that Cuba
is more concerned with getting a good price for its sugar
than going to war.


ECONOMICS ANONYMOUS
Tariff Addicts in Full Cry
A number of holes in AIDA’s arguments
A rguing from the results of a study
■ which shows that widespread sur-
plus capacity still exists in industry and
that less than two-thirds of imports can
be considered essential, the Australian
Industries Development Association has
fired another shot in its 45-year-long
campaign to foster the development of
secondary industry by saying that the
extra employment potential from the full
vise of capacity already available in in-
dustry would be in the vicinity of
100,000 persons.
AIDA is not deterred from making its
strong advocacy for increasing employ-
ment opportunities in secondary industry
by the present national shortages of
labor. It considers that to disregard the
jneed to bring more capacity into use on
the immediate grounds that there is now
/ery little unemployment and that it
vould have inflationary effects and lead
o overful employment is a negative
ittitude.
“What it does mean, in positive
erms,” says AIDA, “is that we may
apidly step up immigration without
indue pressure on resources (certainly
lone in respect of industrial equipment).”
Yes, the long-term task of pressing
)n with secondary industry development
oust not be inhibited by labor short-
ages. The right course is certainly to in-
:rease immigration (together with pro-
ductivity) and ensure that effective
lemand is kept topped up at a level ap-
propriate to absorbing rising production
rom secondary industry without in-
cluding inflationary effects. Equally,
efforts to train more youths for work in
mdustry (even at the expense of the
'■offer academic pursuits) should be step-
ped up.
AIDA’s 100,000 present estimate of
ob-potential in industry is not so dif-
erent to the annual arrivals of teenagers
it employment age. The latter provide
'egular inflow into a built-in reservoir of
abor, and have only to be properly
harnessed to solve the major part of
secondary industry’s labor problem.
year or two ago, when there was high
unemployment, their future absorp-
hon was considered the more intractable
Problem, and although full employment
has seemed to deal with it, it could well
raise its head again if secondary industry
development is not pursued consistently.
All this is possibly common ground,
ut there is room for argument on the
and direction of secondary in-
ustry development, especially about
AIDA’s too easy assumption that the
most scope for achieving it lies in import
replacement stimulated by stronger
tariff protection.
AIDA has now put its case for this
in unequivocal terms in its latest
brochure.
“As AIDA has also repeatedly stress-
ed,” it says, “Australia’s national deve-
lopment aims rest heavily on the con-
tinuing growth and expansion of secon-
dary industries, and on these, too, will
rest an increasing responsibility for ex-
port income in the future. The consider-
able idle capacity existing in most of
Australia’s secondary industries is a nega-
tive of our national economic needs. It
indicates a need for more positive direc-
tion of Government policy to ensure that
our industrial resources are not wasted.
The particular field opened to the
Government in this way is that of tariff
policy, which has in the past and should
in the future, in AIDA’s opinion (if
properly handled), continue to be the
major weapon used to ensure the
healthy operation and continuing growth
of manufacturing industries in the face
of import competition.
“Australia is a most attractive market
for larger industrial producers overseas,
who have advantages of larger scale of
production and/or lower wage costs
which, in many instances, Australian in-
dustries cannot offset by skill and/or
raw material advantages. (In some in-
dustries, of course e.g., basic iron and
steel, non-ferrous metals, etc. they
can.)
“A Government policy designed effec-
tively to protect Australian manufac-
turing industries would bring into pro-
duction existing idle capacity capable of
making extra products worth some £320
million a year and simultaneously save
Australia a similar amount annually in
overseas exchange.
“It is not suggested that Australian
industry could, overnight, increase the
value of its production to the extent of
£320 million a year. It may be, in prac-
tice, that this degree of import replace-
ment would be attained over a few years.
The important point is that this capacity
exists and that efforts should be made
to bring it into effective use.
“Such a policy would enable the
operation of industries at optimum
capacity, by assuring the bulk of the
home market to local producers, and
thus enable them to maximise efficiency
and therefore reduce costs of production.
It would give greater certainty in future
planning for installation of new
equipment, training of operatives, ex-
pansion and modernisation of produc-
tion facilities, purchase of materials and
services.
“Production schedules could be plan-
ned and maintained without interruption
from controllable causes. Attraction of
capital from both local and overseas
investors would benefit, and internal
competition would be stimulated. A
bigger market would be available for
local (and necessary imported) raw
materials, etc. The importance of a
strong industrial structure as defence
potential, of course, needs no elabora-
tion.
“The benefits to Australia’s oversea
trade would be twofold: firstly, it would
reduce our need for imports; secondly,
it would stimulate exports. By using
available local capacity, imports could
be reduced by some £32om. (on 1961-
62 figures). By enabling lower produc-
tion costs in Australian industries, it
will enable greater exports of manufac-
tures.”
VI/’ell, there is the current argument
" for higher protection in all its glory.
There is no need to say it is widely held
and that the molochs of secondary in-
dustry who sponsored it will be satisfied.
But economists and primary industry
people will find a number of holes in it;
the exporters in industrialised countries
who take the bulk of our exports of
primary products may well ask where
they come in; while even its strongest
adherents (including AIDA) seem to
have a sneaking feeling that until the
work force can be increased more
rapidly than at present the Government,
in fear of inflationary consequences,
would have to go slowly in acting more
strenuously to see it fully implemented
in the economy’s present state of near-
full employment.
People are thinking beyond the tariff
as a means of achieving the same objec-
tive as AIDA. For instance, a Mel-
bourne broker reasoned last week that
higher depreciation allowances could be
the right method of stimulating secondary
industry.
“We are told,” he stated, “that re-
serves are currently standing at an all-
time high. But are they? We all know
what inflation has done to the purchasing
power of money, so the answer in real
value terms is: No.
“The answer is not contained in in-
discriminate protection. This does
nothing to meet the competitive situa-
tion overseas. What should be consider-
ed, as one of the avenues of assistance,
is a more generous annual depreciation
allowance on plant, which should go
further than the present export incentive
allowance.”


SHELL’S WONDERFUL
WORLD OF
CHEMICALS
Nearly every industry—certainly every major one relies in some way
on the vast range of chemicals available from Shell. Here are a few highlights
from Shell’s widespread field of progress with chemicals from petroleum.
A FANTASTIC PLASTIC
Polypropylene was specified
for this one-piece chair by
a famous designer. This new
thermoplastic is the latest
and lightest yet developed.
No other substance known
has so favourable a combi-

Gaps in the Companies Acts
T)efore leaping to fill the gaps in their
own Companies Acts, the five other
States which have not yet passed amend-
ments on the lines of Victoria’s recently
promulgated Companies (Public Borrow-
ings) Act 1963 should look closely at the
considered criticisms being levelled at
that Act by a number of authorities in
affected fields.
The latest of these criticisms has come
from Melbourne underwriter and finan-
cier Mr Arthur Goode.
Looking at the amendments from the
angle of an underwriter, Mr Goode pre-
faced his observations by saying bluntly
that they were enacted in a period of
emotional reaction to the faults of cer-
tain major companies and that some of
the provisions imposed a heavy burden
on the normal, well-run company with-
out necessarily preventing irresponsible
use of funds by companies with inefficient
or careless management.
This echoes Sir Alexander Fitzgerald’s
charge that the new Act was “shotgun
legislation”.
The general effect of the Act, in Mr
Goode's view, could well be to make
companies shy of borrowing on specific
charges; that is, on what the Act describes
as “mortgage debenture” and “deben-
ture , and lean more to borrowing on
unsecured notes and unsecured deposit
notes. This, he says, would reduce the
labor of prospectus preparation but it
would also give a lower degree of
security.
Qne certain result will be that the
borrowing corporation’s expenses in
making a mortgage debenture or a de-
benture will be substantially greater.
Admittedly the new requirements for
secured borrowing should, as Mr Goode
said, give the public as accurate a guide
as possible to the true financial position
of the company and enable it to form
an opinion of the worth of the securities
ottered, but the real question is whether
companies will in future think it worth
all the trouble and restraints involved
>n borrowing on secured charges.
Experience under the new Act so far
suggests they will not. Only one pros-
pectus other than for one or two finance
companies and that for a note issue
'~~has been registered in Victoria since
e new Act was proclaimed. Perhaps
the reluctance to borrow on secured
charge may not continue indefinitely,
but no industrial public company has
been prepared to face the burdens for
such borrowing under the Act.
Furthermore, directors have to con-
sider various onerous side-effects of the
new Act in relation to possible borrow-
ing on secured charge. Mr Goode is
concerned, for instance, about the effects
of the limited range, the extension of
duties and the rigid replacement terms
of eligible trustees (named under the Act
as trustee companies, banks, insurance
companies and corporations approved
by the Minister), which might be to
make trustees unwilling to act for lesser-
known or smaller companies, no matter
how solvent they might be.
“This tendency to restrict borrowing
to the great companies was surely not
contemplated by the legislators,” he
said. “It cuts across all the principles
of equality of opportunity. If the group
of trustees is to be restricted to a few
by the Act, then the Act itself should
also provide a means by which every
reputable borrower with an orthodox
trust deed can obtain for certain the
services of a trustee.”
\ way out could be by State spon-
sorship of trustee companies or
through an extension of the office of the
Public Trustee, though Mr Goode
doesn’t venture into such sensitive areas.
Again, eligible trustees will have to
enlarge their facilities for carrying out
the deeper surveillance of borrowing
corporations. The additional require-
ments from trustees will also mean bor-
rowers will have to pay very much more
for trustee services.
This will increase the cost of borrow-
ing under the terms of the Act and
thus make it less attractive, giving even
more of a bias towards unsecured and
shorter-term borrowing and equity
finance, perhaps in circumstances where
only long-term secured borrowing would
be appropriate.
Though saying the requirement is not
“unreasonable”, Mr Goode also has
some reservations on the necessity for
boards of borrowing corporations to re-
port every three months to trustees and
the registrar of companies on matters
affecting the security of the debenture
or note holders. Many directors, he
says, feel they cannot do this without a
complete audit.
On the requirement to submit fully
audited accounts every six months and
for these to be made available to the
public, Mr Goode is less compromising.
“It may appear a relative burden if it
be imposed only on those companies
which borrow from the public,” he said.
As to the position of auditors of bor-
rowing corporations, Mr Goode said
that as their duties had been made so
much more onerous, both in fact and by
implication, “they may well wish to have
the opportunity of retiring from the
audit of a company which decides to
borrow from the public. Certainly,
higher professional fees are likely to be
charged by auditors as well as by
trustees as a result of the new legisla-
tion.”
Humming up, Mr Goode said: “While
it became apparent that some
amendment to the Companies Act was
necessary in the interests of giving great-
er security to the public, it is doubtful if
all of the provisions will, in fact, assist
materially. An underwriter would be
alert to such occurring and take whatever
means are required to protect the public,
but it is just the dubious issues which
naturally are not underwritten that are
likely to offend.”
While admitting that the method of
specifying exactly what is implied by
the title of the securities is a good deve-
lopment and one which could be help-
ful, Mr Goode envisaged a pitfall in this
if investors came to trust unduly in a
security because of its designation (for
instance a “debenture”).
The restriction of the term “deben-
ture” to a specific secured charge im-
parts a feeling of security which could
be real in the case of certain companies
and illusory in the case of others, where
assets could be perhaps the paper of an
incompetently run finance company or
the operating plant of a company, which
is valued as part of a going concern
and not, or course, for its break-up
value.
“The knowledge that the Act oper-
ates, that quarterly returns must go to
the trustees and that trustees and audi-
tors have wider function and responsi-
bilities,” added Mr Goode, “could well
induce a feeling that ‘all's well" when, in
fact, the real security must always be
the company the competency and
responsibility of the board, the success
of the business of the company and the
prosperity of the industry in which it
operates. No legislation can get blood
from a stone.”


Malaysia’s Trade and People
The great influence of the Central Bank
From ALEX JOSEY in Singapore
/"In March 21, 1964, the Governor of
the Bank Negara Malaysia (State
Bank ot Malaysia) opened a branch in
Singapore, the prosperous island-state
which is now part of Malaysia. This, as
the Governor said, was a logical conse-
quence of the historical process which led
to the establishment of Malaysia.
From the monetary and banking point
of view the nine States of Malaya,
Penang, Malacca and Singapore have
always been a single unit. A common
currency linked them since the intro-
duction of the Straits dollar in 1903.
Singapore’s commercial needs, as the
greatest trade centre of Malaya, led to
the establishment of many banks there,
and many branches of these banks in
various parts of Malaya. Funds moved
freely between the States of Malaya and
Singapore.
There are 35 banks operating in Singa-
pore, and 110 banking offices. At the
end of 1963 their deposits amounted to
$1,092 million.
With the opening of a branch in Singa-
pore, the Bank Negara Malaysia has
made a logical move because it is, in
fact, the Central Bank of Malaysia with
very wide statutory powers which affect
Singapore as they do the rest of Malaysia.
Formed five years ago with assets of
$l2l million, the bank now has assets
amounting to $2OO million. It acts as
banker to the Central Government, to
some of the State Governments, and for
some statutory bodies.
T>ank Negara Malaysia has gradually
added to its responsibilities. It has
taken over the management of the local
funded debt from the Central Govern-
ment, administers the Exchange Control
Ordinance on behalf of the Central
Government, and is the agent of the
Currency Board in Kuala Lumpur, Pen-
ang and now in Singapore.
In addition, Bank Negara Malaysia is
financial adviser to the Central Govern-
ment, and, in this capacity, is called upon
to advise on various matters concerning
the economic and financial policies of
the Government.
In Singapore, the Bank is able to offer
a full range of banking services, and
arrangements have already been com-
pleted for the Bank to take over a num-
ber of Singapore Government accounts.
Two of the principal objects of the
Central Bank are to promote monetary
stability and a sound financial structure,
and to influence the credit situation to
the advantage of Malaysia. Bank Negara
Malaysia has been given statutory
powers to carry out these objects. It has
power to give directions to other banks
on the observance of liquidity and statu-
tory reserve requirements, to prescribe
a “local assets” ratio, and to determine
the structure of interest rates and influ-
ence the direction of bank lending.
T egislative formalities have yet to be
completed to enable the Central
Bank to exercise control and supervision
over all commercial banks in Malaysia.
When these legal formalities are com-
pleted within the next few months, it
will be necessary for banks in Singapore
to observe the same liquidity and statu-
tory reserve requirements as those in
the rest of Malaysia.
The liquidity ratio applicable to banks
in Malaysia at present is 25 p.c. of total
deposit liabilities.
The statutory reserve required to be
maintained with the Central Bank is 4
p.c. of total deposit liabilities.
For banks which have branches in all
parts of Malaysia it will be the combined
Malaysian position which would be rele-
vant for the purpose of calculating the
liquidity and statutory reserve ratios. It
is expected that certain Singapore com-
mercial banks will have to make adjust-
ments to comply with these requirements.
Bank Negara Malaysia has already ex-
pressed hopes that “with regard to the
‘local assets’ ratio, banks, particularly
those with large holdings of foreign assets
in their portfolios, will of their own ac-
cord increase their investments in local
assets, so that it would not be necessary
for us to prescribe such a ratio.”
Bank Negara Malaysia points out that
“there is a fast changing pattern of busi-
ness activity in Malaysia today, especially
in Singapore”, and banks should review
their investment policies in keeping with
this changing pattern.
As regards interest rates, with the co-
operation of the commercial banks in
Singapore and throughout Malaysia, the
Central Bank has been able to maintain
some degree of rationalisation in the in.
terest rate structure. The same maxim®
rate of interest for fixed deposits an:
minimum rates of interest for bank ai
vances are applicable in Singapore as it
the rest of Malaysia.
Bankers and businessmen in Singapoii
share the confidence of Central Bank of
ficials that when the jurisdiction of Baal
Negara Malaysia is fully extended D
Singapore, commercial banks in Singa-
pore will extend their full and unhesitat-
ing co-operation to the Central Bank it
order to promote monetary stability an
a sound financial structure, and to it
fluence the credit situation to the at
vantage of the new nation.

Malaysia’s need for a sound economic
policy was a radio talk by Dr Lim Swee
Aim, Malaysia’s Minister of Commerce
and Industry. He gave some encourag-
ing figures but made no more than a
fleeting reference to the cost of rural
development, and made no mention of
Malaysia’s defence burden, caused by
Indonesia's aggressive confrontation.
Dr Lim claimed that Malaya had the
“rare distinction” of being “perhaps the
only country to increase its foreign ex-
change reserves after gaining independ-
ence.” Dr Lim insisted this was a mark
of good government.
At the same time, Dr Lim admitted
that, while, since 1959 the volume of
Malaya’s trade had increased, the favor-
able balance of trade had decreased.
He said there were two reasons for
this. First, the price of rubber had fal-
len steadily. Secondly, more money had
been spent on development projects. In
the past six years, the price of rubber
had fallen 29 cents per pound. For
every fall of one cent, he said, Malaya
earned about sl6 million less per year.
Yet, during this same six-year period, the
Malayan Government had spent just over
$1,400 million on national economic de-
velopment. Private investors had spent
about the same amount on investments
in all types of industry.
is still Malaya’s largest single
industry, producing one-third of the
world's total. Rubber accounts for more
than half Malaya’s export earnings. One-
third of the population is directly or in-
directly dependent on rubber for its live-
lihood.
It is expected that for the next ten
years, rubber will continue to earn most
of Malaya’s foreign exchange. The
Government is sinking nearly SSOO mil-
lion in two schemes to produce better
quality natural rubber at a cheaper price.
Before long, Malaya expects to produce
a ton of rubber per acre per year.
Tin makes up one-fifth of the export
earnings. Iron ore is another important
primary export.
The annual report of the Bank Negara,
just out, says that the volume of physical
output and of trade was larger, and total
public development expenditure and pri-
vate investment exceeded all previous
levels. But real income did not increase
because of the growth of population.
Singapore’s domestic economy during
1963, the Bank report stated, was char-
acterised by an upsurge in the various
sectors, especially building construction
and manufacturing industries.

Custom life is increasing
this man’s life assurance policy
That’s what we mean by “Guaranteed Insurability”!
Four years ago, at age 36, this
man took out a Customlife policy,
with guaranteed insurability.
Today, although stricken with a
heart attack, he is exercising his
option to increase his cover by
£5,000 —the amount of his
original insurance.
It is granted without question.
Without penalty rate.
This option is possible through
our “Guaranteed Insurability”
plan. Briefly, it guarantees you
the right to increase your life
assurance cover periodically with-
out the need for further medical
examination —regardless of the
state of your health at any of the
option dates.
Customlife realises that one cannot
depend on constant good health, and,
realising this, provides for your protection
in the event of any illness at any time.
Let’s look at specifics:
From birth to age 40, it is possible for
you to increase the cover on your life
five times. Option dates exist at ages 24,
28, 32, 36 and 40 to increase cover by
an amount not exceeding the original sum
assured . . . which can be up to £5,000.
Thus, taking advantage of all options,
you have a maximum amount purchas-
able of £30,000, with only the one
medical examination when the initial
policy is taken out.
Even if you should delay to, say, age 35,
you still have two further option dates.
Perhaps you are thirty now; you have a
young family and a responsibility for
their future and your own. You can
take out an initial policy for any amount
up to £5,000, and increase it as you will
at the option dates, with no fear of
refusal on medical grounds.
The coverage, of course, applies to
women, too. The same complete protec-
tion applies to you as a career woman,
or a young wife sharing family responsi-
bilities.
This is worry-free security, enabling you
to plan for the future with a new
confidence.
You can have more specific details of
this Life Assurance plan by contacting
your nearest Customlife office (listed
below). If you have delayed buying life
assurance, this may be the wisest time for
you to move. Customlife will tailor a
policy to your requirements immediately.

MARKET POINTERS
Those Too Rosy Interims
Incoming investors punished unfairly
Shareholders of various companies,
quite rightly, have been complain-
ing about the glaring discrepancies be-
tween optimistic interim reports and the
final dismal result.
It’s bad enough for the existing share-
holder, but the incoming investor who
buys the shares is being punished un-
fairly because he is purchasing an asset
which is quite falsely valued.
True, there is some merit in not
panicking shareholders. Directors who
whistle in the dark invariably hope that
some miracle will pull the company out
of the mire. But they have a duty to
the public beyond trying to maintain
a brave front. It is getting so that in-
vestors are beginning to distrust all
interim reports and the stage is
approaching where auditors may be re-
quired to certify half-yearly accounts
. . . or certify the directors.
★ ★ ★
TGe rise in bank overdraft rates sug-
A gests that public companies may be
more readily inclined to consider new
share issues in the future.
This view is reinforced by the invest-
ment manager of the AMP Society,
Mr J. T. C. Hurley, who warned re-
cently that the larger public companies
may need to rely more heavily on public
raisings. With so many demands for
institutional funds, including the 30-20
Government securities requirement, life
offices may prefer placements of ordi-
nary shares below the market price, or
even act as sub-underwriters rather than
lend money at fixed interest.
Public companies have remained con-
servative in their approach to share-
holders for new money. This is a reason-
able attitude in view of dividend liabi-
lity (after tax) at a time when the
economy was climbing out of the 1961
recession.
But with share prices at buoyant
levels and the economy showing steady
signs of expansion, directors may be
encouraged to consider new ordinary
share issues again.
The benefits of these are exemplified
by the latest l-for-4 par issue by James
Hardie Asbestos. With the £1 shares
selling at above £7, the new issue is
tantamount to a bonus.
★ ★ ★
general round of higher interest
rates, including an increase in the
short-term fixed deposit rate now per-
mitted the trading banks, could make
4 tougher for the finance companies to
raise extra funds from the public.
Many of these companies have de-
benture borrowings to renew, and the
public needs to be offered attractive
competitive rates.
Further reports of bad debts do not
help and, unfortunately, companies who
have a clean debt position tend to be
lumped in the same category.
The market has acknowledged the
stronger position of the banks in recent
months and the rights to the new 1-for-
-4 issue of National Bank of Australasia
at 2s. 6d. premium, if obtainable near
125., would provide a new share at
245. 6d. to yield a fraction over 4 p.c.
★ ★ ★
HTalking about high-priced shares,
Emu & Prospect Gravel £1 shares
are selling at £7 10s. compared with
a recent all-time high of £7 15s. There
are only 143,943 of these tightly held
shares and, with a disclosed earning
rate of 41.6 p.c., the market believes
that something has got to give.
At this stage, only a bonus or a
takeover could justify the market yield
of only 2.3 p.c.
★ ★ ★
/\il shares are definitely in the dol-
drums and no one wants them.
This is usually the time to take an
interest. When the buying enthusiasm
is on, prices go to ridiculous levels.
Although it is painful to revive old
memories, those people who were so
enthusiastic about AOG’s prospects in
those early oil speculation days surely
must believe that the shares are in a
much stronger position today. Yet they
can be picked up for around 335.
The pipeline is built, the current out-
put is guaranteed for 15 months and,
if anyone else strikes oil in the vicinity,
the Union-Kern-AOG pipeline would
stand to benefit.
If another strike eventuates this year,
there will be plenty of people who will
kick themselves for not “specking' 5 at
current prices.

INVESTMENT SECTION
Ampol’s Sketchy Interim Report
Stock and note holders deserve more information
usual brief interim report from
Ampol Petroleum Ltd, declaring a
10 p.c. increase in revenue and 13 p.c.
increase in gallonage sold in the six
months to March 31, was interpreted as
mildly reassuring news by the market.
The shares moved up a few pence next
day to 11s.
But more questioning readers felt the
76,500 stock and note holders deserved
more information from a company
which reports so fully at the end of
each year.
The ambitious capital investment
programme, and the very narrow margin
of earnings over dividends in the last
two years, have made investors much
more critical of Ampol’s investment
status than they ever were before.
The company has £7.8 million of
shares which are deferred as to dividend
until 1966-67, and £750,000 of capital
(held by Caltex) which is entitled to
5 p.c. dividend until 1966-67, then
ranking equally with ordinary shares for
the expected 14 p.c. dividend, and £4
million of 6 p.c. notes which convert
to ordinary shares mid-way through
1966-67.
Ampol must improve its earning capa-
city by a formidable amount in the next
three years to satisfy shareholders.
Advice as to the amount of profit
earned for the six months, compared
with its predecessor, and the earning
rate would assist investors to make a
better-informed assessment of the com-
pany's performance at this half-way
mark.
Investors Caught Napping
report last week that Great East-
ern Brick was unlikely to pay any
dividend for the current financial year
caught many investors napping. The
shares had been going for around ss.
par, a rather high price seeing that no
dividend was paid last year either.
Still, buyers’ optimism was justified.
Dividends had been 123 p.c. in 1962 but
no distribution was made last year des-
pite earnings of 13.5 p.c. because of
costs in relation to establishing the clay
brick plant. With the new plant and
a housing boom, the possibility of a
dividend this year seemed very high.
The directors realised that many
shareholders were thinking like this and
so pointed out in the interim report
that the revival in the industry did not
reach the Latrobe Valley (the company
operates from Traralgon, Vic.) during
the half-year. Apparently its effects have
at last arrived there because at present
the production of w'ire-cut clay bricks
is not large enough to meet demands.
Directors believe that this trend will
continue and are trying to step-up pro-
duction. This may mean that there is
a remote chance for a final payout.
More definitely, the trend led the board
to state that it expected to return to the
dividend list in 1964-65.
Ansett Flies Past Shareholders
A big profit lift will be necessary if
Ansett Transport Industries hopes
to maintain last year’s earning rate on
capital in 1963-64. It was announced
last week that the company had made
a private placement with financial insti-
tutions of four million ss. ordinary
shares at 7s. Bd. This will lift paid
capital by £1 million to around £B.B mil-
lion.
As the cash will be used to develop
television interests and help towards the
programme of full jet aircraft replace-
ment, its profit-earning capabilities will
not be reflected in the current year and
only very mildly in 1964-65. In fact,
it will probably be 1965-66 at least be-
fore ATV-0 in Melbourne starts earning
reasonable profits.
At first this seems a pretty rough deal
for normal shareholders. They will see
a watered earning rate for at least a year
but, on top of this, the profit will be
subject to higher dividend charges as
the new shares rank for payouts as from
July 1 this year. Many of them will be
moaning because the company did not
come to them for the money.
On the other hand, however, it would
have been very difficult for Mr Ansett
to raise the same amount from the
market. As the shares are currently
fetching around Bs. 9d., few people
would be happy to part with the 2s. Bd,
premium as well as the ss. par.
fore, only a par issue could have had
guaranteed success. But to raise the
same amount, about £1,533,000 from a
par issue, the increase in paid capital
would end up more than 50 p.c. higher
than the present £1 million.
So in reality, Mr Anseti’s decision will
give a smaller fall in earning rate and
create a lower dividend charge than if
an issue had been made to shareholders
instead.
New Records for Permewan
Dermewan Wright, Melbourne-based
general grocery and produce mer-
chant, ruled its books off at the end of
March. Results for the year are usually
announced at the beginning of August.
Although the performance for this year
will not be as spectacular as 1962-63,
it will undoubtedly show great improve-
ment and create new records.
Last year the profit catapulted 70 p.c.
to £273,000 after sales had touched £lB
million. The result equalled 19.3 p.c. on
average ordinary capital and a dividend
of 12+ p.c. was paid. The year was
marked by further vigorous expansion
and 15 units were added to the group,
including six self-service stores in Mel-
bourne and four wholesale units in
NSW.
At balance date, the group was opera-
ting through 169 units 97 retail self-
service stores, 54 country stores, 16
self-service wholesale stores and two
food manufacturing and processing
factories.
The 1963-64 result will benefit from
further expansion and a full year’s
trading by these acquisitions. The in-
terim report of last November said sales
were running at an annual rate of £2O
million and profit was up “substantially”.
Among the takeovers has been Pay’s
Stores in Kerang (Vic.).
Although the group’s current 1964-65
year has only just got under way, take-
overs have already been made. Seven
self-service grocery stores in the Sydney
metropolitan area have been bought
from Bruce’s Process Food Store Pty
Ltd, as well as another business in
Kiama (NSW).
It seems that the 1964-65 result will
show' further increases over any records
which have been set in the year just
finished.
No Flash in the Pan
Tt seems that the remarkable recovery
made by Eliza Tinsley during 1962-
63 was not a flash in the pan. Although
the report for the latest nine months
to March 31 made no mention of profit)

it did say that sales had shown a “satis-
factory” increase.
Profit in 1962-63 leapt from £55,000
to £82,000 to equal a healthy 18.7 p.c.
earning rate on paid capital. More
important for shareholders was the
restoration of the 12} p.c. dividend
which had been cut back to 10 p.c. in
the previous year.
It looks as if the payout will be
maintained in the current year a
steady interim of 5 p.c. has been de-
clared. Moreover, there is no reason
why its basic activity as a hardware
merchant should be any less profitable
than last year, and so the “satisfactory”
sales increase may also point to a “satis-
factory” profit increase.
Amalg. Chem. Due For a Rise
A lthough there is a division of
opinion on the worth of Amalga-
mated Chemicals Ltd as an investment,
the chairman (Mr J. D. Wilson) is al-
ways supremely confident of the com-
pany’s prospects.
He has made the statement that
Amalgamated Chemicals would only be
in trouble if Australians stopped eating.
Market gardeners could not survive
without the sort of agricultural chemi-
cals which Amalgamated formulates and
distributes.
In the annual report for the year to
December, directors referred to the
expense of reorganisation and integra-
tion of various units of the group, and
the adverse effect of unseasonal weather
on sales.
The company, as previously reported,
earned 10 p.c. less than in 1962, but
advanced its dividend from 12} to
13? p.c. Directors said progress made
was adequate justification for a higher
percentage of profits being distributed.
The Parco acquisition, making Amal-
gamated the leading aerosol custom
packer in Australia, is expected to bring
considerable benefits this year and in
future.
At 15s. and yielding 4.6 p.c., the ss.
shares have plenty of scope for apprecia-
tion.
Savoy and Mr Hall
T'he “small profit” earned by Savoy
A Corporation in the December half-
year is to be expected, seeing that the
company has been reorganising since
Mr J. R. Hall assumed control late last
year. Before this, the group was de-
scribed as a hotel owner and real estate
developer, but its aim now is to become
a large housing project builder.
Its first major move in this direction
was last January’s purchase of a sub-
stantial interest in Mr Hall's US Finance
Corporation, which controls a group of
finance, land speculating and building
companies (with no United States affilia-
tions). Almost simultaneously, a num-
ber of Savoy’s non-building activities
were in the process of being sold,
namely, a hotel at Villawood (NSW),
half the Gold Coast properties and an
investment in a WA pastoral company.
The next major move was in Febru-
ary the purchase of the Victa homes
division from Victa Consolidated Ltd.
The latest is a takeover bid for the
Langridge Permanent Building Society,
through which Mr Hall hopes to raise
cash for financing the people who buy
his houses.
The interim report pointed out that
trade in the current half-year was buoy-
ant. This apparently indicates that the
first effects of reorganisation and Mr
Hall's management are being felt. Most
important, however, is the fact that di-
rectors expect that “a dividend relative
to the full year will be declared when
the annual accounts are available”.

No payout was made last year after
profits slumped from £98,085 to £771.
The distribution in the previous year
had been 12} p.c.
Mr Hall's chances of producing a
result as good as 1962 are virtually non-
existent this year, but it seems fair to
expect at least a vast improvement on
the 1963 figure if the tenor of the
interim report is any guide.
London Store’s Good Prospects
the current price of Bs. 9d., which
yields a lucrative 7.1 p.c. from
dividends, London Stores’ ss. share offer
the investor a sizeable income while
waiting for long-term capital growth.
Despite the one-for-one bonus made
late last year, reserves at £870,533 are
still far in excess of the paid capital at
£700,000. The bonus doubled capital
so that earnings in the latest year to
February 28 toppled from 21.7 p.c. to
H I p.c. But profit is still pointing up
following the decline from £77,000 to
£63,000 in 1962 £71,000 in 1963
and £75,000 in the latest year.
Even if competition in Bourke Street
(Melbourne) keeps growing, the drift to
suburban trade will undoubtedly help
the company as it has stores at Dande-
nong and Prahran. The current price is
historically low and gives a chance of
a fairly cheap entry into a sound and
steadily growing organisation.
Goodwins’ Bad Loss
stock market suspected troubles
for Newtown electrical retailer
Goodwins Ltd, for at no time this year
have the ss. shares been valued above
3s.
The company has reported a loss for
the half-year to December 31 and omis-
sion of the interim dividend. The record
is this:
Profit Dividend %
1960 £161,162 m

Bad debts of £133,385 have been
written off in the last six months. It has
not charged these against the £230,000
provision created last June “pending
proof of the estimated results that
should follow recovery action”.
As if this was not enough trouble, a
stock shortage of £14,733 was revealed
by a stock-take at the end of March.
The company declares that it earned
a small profit in the three months to
March 31, but the shares remain at
around Is. sd.
One thing is predictable: the holder
of options to take up 500,000 ss. shares
at par within three months of the com-
pany filing the 1963-64 balance sheet
with the Sydney Stock Exchange will
not be exercising his option.
Kelvinator’s Plastics
IZelvinator Australia’s record profit
announcement did not mention
which of the group’s activities had con-
tributed most to the increase. As usual,
this task will be left to the directors in
their annual report and the chairman in
his address at the annual meeting.
However, if the remarks of the chair-
man, Mr A. L. Slade, at last year’s
meeting can be used as a guide, it seems
that the plastics division must be
credited with playing a large part in
the improvement. He told shareholders
that a number of orders for plastic parts
from motor vehicle manufacturers could

mark the beginning of a new trend for
the motor industry.
On the strength of these orders, Kel-
vinator budgeted for substantial sales
by the plastics division during the year
which closed on March 31 last. The
profit lift from £359,000 to £394,000
must be largely due to the fact that this
budget was adhered to, if not exceeded
it is a fairly safe bet that the sales of
refrigerators and the group’s other elec-
trical appliances (especially the air-
conditioning units) did not fare as well
as the plastics as these products are
currently operating under highly com-
petitive conditions.
More important at present is the fact
that plastics could lift the profit to a
new level during 1964-65, provided the
profitability of the other activities does
not slip. The Commonwealth Govern-
ment’s moves to ensure that around 90
p.c. of locally assembled vehicles com-
prise Australian-made components will
undoubtedly create a bigger demand on
Kelvinator’s plastic parts.
If the directors feel that this is the
case, then shareholders should see men-
tion of another increase in the budget
for plastic sales in the annual report or
at the annual meeting.
Earning Rate in Danger
Tt is hoped that the omission of any-
reference to the current half-year
in the interim report from Austral
Bakeries (a Victorian concern) does not
mean that profit will fail to rise during
these final months. A lift is needed if
last year's earning rate is to be main-
tained on capital since increased by
several takeovers.
In the December half, profit was al-
most constant despite a “considerable
increase” in the sales of the main
operating subsidiary, Austral Bakeries
Pty Ltd, whose best-known product is
“Home Pride Bread”. The directors
attributed this increase mainly to new
acquisitions. Profit failed to gain be-
cause of the granting of additional mar-
gins, extra annual leave and the costs
of consolidating the Gippsland activities.
If the Gippsland consolidation is the
largest of these troubles, then improve-
ments should set in during 1964-65, if
not in the current year. The full inte-
gration of the various bakeries and the
operation of a “Home Pride” plant at
Morwell, which will become the centre
for the area, should be finished by June
this year.
Unfortunately these moves will not be
helping the 1963-64 result. It looks as
though a lower earning rate is inevit-
able, but this should not cause too much
concern as last year’s 16.2 p.c. more
than twice covered the 8 p.c. dividend.
Kornblmns’ Thorn
IZornblums Furnishings’ manufac-
turing subsidiary is still the main
thorn in the group’s side. The con-
tinued losses of this division in the year
to January 27 offset the improved pro-
fits of the warehousing subsidiaries to
produce the overall loss of £1869
announced recently.
The group is centred in Melbourne
as a furnisher, importer and warehouser
warehouses also run in Sydney, Ade-
laide and Brisbane. The manufacturing
subsidiary operates at Abbotsford (Vic.)
and was originally established to make
furnishing fabrics. However, growing
import competition squashed the efforts
of the division and the directors decided
last year to diversify its activities into
other woven goods.
Despite this diversification no material
progress has been made, according to
directors. So it seems that the only
sensible move is to get out of manu-
facturing and stop the losses now
unless of course there is a definite
chance of profitable trading in the cur-
rent year.
Even if initial capital losses were in-
curred, abandoning the subsidiary seems
to be the only fair thing to do as ordi-
nary shareholders have not seen a divi-
dend since the 10 p.c. of 1960. The
cumulative participating preference
holders received 7 p.c. that year it
has been 6 p.c. ever since.
This payout has made the Jot of the
ordinary holders even less savory. Earn-
ings from 1961 to the latest result have
been too small to cover the payout and
reserves would have been eaten into if
it had not been for several profits on the
sale of assets.
Of course, it is possible that the sale
of the subsidiary may not result in a
profit of the magnitude necessary to pay
an ordinary dividend. But at least it
would put trading back on to a profit-
able basis.
Lensworth has Something
could still be something in the
ss. shares of Lensworth Finance,
currently going for about 17s. 9d. A
recent prospectus for a debenture issue
shows that profit in the seven months
to December 31 was £84,667 after tax
This must indicate a sizeable increase
for the whole term as profit in the full
1962-63 year was only £93,448 after
tax.
That year's 15 p.c. payout was com-
fortably covered by an earning rate of
about 20 p.c. If this year's rate im-
proves substantially, as it apparently
will, a dividend lift or at least a rise in
the market price would be warranted.
At the present prices, the dividend yield
is a far from meagre 4.2 p.c.
Vintage Year for Vigneron
A two-for-five bonus from Linde-
man (biddings) Ltd repeats the
issue of October, 1962, and brings paid
capital to £700,000.
The holding company was formed by
a two-for-one exchange (that is a one-
for-one bonus) in October, 1959, so
shareholders in this company have been
very generously treated.
Moreover, the current 15 p.c. divi-
dend will be maintained, in the absence
of unforeseeable circumstances, on the
bonus-enlarged capital, although bonus
shares will not rank for any dividend in
respect of 1963-64 profit.
The company simultaneously reported
“satisfactory and profitable trading re-
sults” for the six months to December
31, so shareholders can expect a vintage
year.
The shares should be around 265.
ex-bonus, judging by the cum-bonus
price of 365. The yield then would be
approximately 2.9 p.c.

LETTER TO THE EDITOR
The Neon Signs
Debacle:
Some Questions
Dear Sir, — As a shareholder in Neon
Signs (A’asia) Limited I have lost
heavily on my investment, but I realise
that this is the risk one has to take in
buying shares in any company, irrespec-
tive of how prosperous it may appear to
be.
What perturbs me more than the
loss of my capital, however, is that cer-
tain principles have been lost sight of
in this debacle. At no stage have the
directors of Neon Signs offered any
satisfactory explanation for the sudden
and severe reverses experienced by the
company, nor have they reconciled
their conflicting statements regarding the
company’s trading.
For example, at the annual meeting
on December 20 last, one of the direc-
tors stated that the company had earned
a small profit in the first few months of
the current year. Now, however, we
are bluntly told by the board that in
the six months to December the com-
pany in fact incurred a further trading
loss of £105,000, apart from a further
write-down of signs and lighting instal-
lations to the tune of £327,000.
The chairman, in his address to share-
holders at the meeting, made the fol-
lowing statements (I quote from the
annual report): “It is expected that
when the half-yearly figures to Decem-
ber are produced subsidiary losses will
have terminated and profits will be on
an upward trend. Results for the first
quarter to September 30 in all divisions
give cause to believe that the problems
of last year's trading have been cured
and that the company may look for-
ward to better results in all five divi-
sions. The increased sales secured are
making such contribution to gross profits
that satisfactory net profits should re-
sult as the present year will not be asked
to carry any establishment costs.
“Accounts of all subsidiaries have
been carefully analysed. Debtors and
stocks in all subsidiaries were reviewed
and write-off made where any doubt
existed and adequate provisions were
raised to meet future contingencies.
'‘lt was felt that the group activities
are so soundly based that every oppor-
tunity should be given to enable the
company to quickly return to full pro-
fit earning. We have great confidence
in the future success of this company.”
As the annual meeting was held only
11 days before the end of the half-
yearly period, how can such contradic-
tions be justified?
With regard to the company’s pub-
lished balance sheets, if we add the
provisions made in the 1962-63 report
to the £327,000 above, total adjustments
to asset valuations (apart from trading
losses) so far total £454,000.
Surely these adjustments actually re-
present a series of overstatements of
profits in previous years totalling some-
thing like the same amount. If such is
the case, it looks doubtful to me, as a
layman, whether the company actually
made any profits at all in recent years.
Thus, it appears that dividends have been
paid out of the funds provided by issues
of debentures, notes, etc., rather than
out of profits.
Therefore, I would pose the question,
“Have the accounts issued by Neon
Signs represented a true and fair view
of the company’s affairs as certified each
year by the directors and auditors?” If
the accounts have been as incorrect as
it appears from the foregoing, who is
to assume responsibility for publication
of the misleading information which has
caused heart-breaking losses to many
investors? If the responsibility is only
a moral one, what justification is there
to trust the accounts of any public
company?
I would also like to know why the
affairs of the company have not been the
subject of official Government enquiry.
I would be interested to read in your
columns the opinions of other Neon
Signs shareholders on these matters.

presents one of these opportunities and,
following an interim report which stated
. . the aggregate net profits for the
half-year were below those for the
similar term of the previous year,” the
price of the shares has declined from a
high point of 20s. during the first full
week in January to a current level of
18s. 3d.
At this price the shares yield from the
current 124 p.c. dividend about 3.7 p.c.,
and, bearing in mind the fact that over
the last ten years dividends per share
have increased fairly steadily at the rate
of 111 p.c. per annum, the shares
appear to be at attractive levels. In
fact, if the same rate of increase should
continue for the next ten years and then
level off at a rate of 3 p.c. per annum,
the effective return would be 94 p.c.
The market clearly does not expect
this rate to continue for, if it did, the
shares would be priced around 225.
Perhaps it may help in the appraisal
of the shares to compare the indices of
sales, net profit before tax, depreciation
and interest on long-term debt (under
the heading “Profits” in the schedule),
per share earnings and per share divi-
dends. (The 1957 year has been taken
as the base year solely because at the
time of writing I did not have reliable
figures for profitability and earnings
prior to that year.)

VTo one would deny that the 1960-61
and the 1961-62 years were very dif-
ficult, and so far as International Resist-
ance was concerned there was a marked
fall off in sales to the television and
radio industry. From the statistics
given in the directors’ last report, it
would seem that these sales fell by
about 274 p.c. from 1958-59 to
1960-61. But the remaining sales to
general industry appear to have in-
creased by 44 p.c.
According to the directors’ report,
general industry includes the automo-
tive industry and it may well be that the
substantial lift in sales in 1962-63 was
due to some extent to the boom in this
area.
Generally, International Resistance
seems to have widened its field of cus-
tomers and this could be expected to
give greater stability to earnings, but
perhaps growth may not be as spectacu-
lar as it was during the years when TV
was being introduced to Australia and
the radio and television industry took
nearly 50 p.c. of International Resist-
ance’s sales.
The increasing use of automation in
industry must mean that the demand for
electronic components will increase.
Electronic data processing is also provi-
ding a new market which, in due time,
will be served by the local producer.
The current housing boom should ex-
tend into a future domestic appliance
boom in, say, 1964-65 and Australian
demography suggests that this boom
could continue until at least the end of
the sixties.
Qo despite the poor start to this decade,
which in many ways was paral-
leled by the beginning of the ’fifties,
there is every prospect that growth
could continue at the same level from
the demand viewpoint. The problem is
whether there will be as much money
in it.
Looking at the two indices for sales
and profits, it is fairly clear that while
the margin was reduced considerably in
1960-61 and 1961-62, it had recovered
in 1962-63 nearly to the 1958-59 level.
But it seems likely that margins are
down, for one would otherwise have
expected an improved relationship of
sales to profits in 1962-63 because,
firstly, sales were at a record level and,
secondly, operating costs should have
been reduced by “the relocation of five
subsidiary companies together with the
general administration of the group into
one area in Kingsgrove . . which
took place in 1960-61.
This move, it was stated in the 1961
directors’ report, had “already produced
operating economies which will become
even more pronounced as higher levels
of output are regained.”
It must be assumed that the pressure
on prices and, therefore, "Crn margins
comes from IRH’s customers since
much of the company’s production is
against firm orders. No doubt these
customers, mainly automotive and other
durable consumer products manufac-
turers, are also faced with maintaining
or even reducing their selling prices
while costs are still edging upwards.
As there would seem to be little com-
petition locally, it can only be assumed
that IRH’s main competitors are over-
seas producers selling into Australia. So
far as Ducon Industries is concerned,
the companies do not appear to com-
pete to any major extent. Ducon is a
major producer of capacitors, but only
a small producer of resistors. IRH is
a major producer of resistors but does
not seem to be a large producer of
capacitors.
VTaturally it is difficult to know
whether or not Ducon’s range will be
extended now that Plessey of the UK
have acquired the group.
The general picture seems to be one
of a growth situation coupled with
increasing competition. This is a clas-
sical pattern and from the investor’s
angle he has only to decide at what
point competition neutralises the growth.
This point does not seem to have
arisen so far as International Resist-
ance is concerned, and certainly at cur-
rent levels the shares seem to be good
buying. In arriving at this opinion, it
is necessary to read into the interim
report for the half-year to December 31,
1963, the idea that profits were down
mainly because of “the relocation of
certain manufacturing processes and the
development and establishment of new
product lines.”

BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS
Cox Bros’ Ills Hard to Cure
The spectre of £15.1 million in deposits
Announcement of a group loss of
** about £400,000 in the six months
to January 31, and omission of all ordi-
nary and preference dividends by the
parent, kicked the ss. shares of Cox
Bros (Aust.) Ltd down a few more
pence to 2s. 3d.
Grave doubts have been felt by the
market for a considerable time on the
future of the group. In 1960-61 and
1961-62 profits only just covered the
10 p.c. dividend commitment, and the
heavy reliance on deposit money and
other loan funds always loomed large
in market considerations.
In the year to July 31, 1963, the Cox
group traded at a loss of £175,252. The
culprit was Sydney Snow Pty Ltd, which
incurred a loss of £289,512. Located in
Sydney near the Central Railway, an
area losing trade to the Quay end of the
city and to the suburbs, Snows, which
was bought for £1.4 million in 1955,
has been a problem business for years.
Management finally decided to face
the inevitable and to contract Snow’s
operations. The outside traveller opera-
tion was closed down and trading in big-
ticket items discontinued. The store is
now concentrating solely on the retailing
of softgoods.
The main Sydney Snow property
was also written down by £113,166 to
£675,000 to conform to VG valuation.
Other Cox properties were written up
by £383,518, and five properties were
sold for a capital profit of £129,141
during 1962-63.
The group showed freehold properties
at £14,522,206 in 1963 accounts, which
were subject to mortgages of
£3,214,500. The board was endeavor-
ing to release funds for trading by sale
and lease-back as the chain variety
stores are doing so successfully.
A major step to keep the company
afloat was made by directors in March,
when they sold Foy and Gibson (WA)
Ltd to David Jones Ltd for £3.9 million
cash. The company claimed that by eli-
minating Foy’s £2.4 million liabilities,
this transaction improved group liquid-
ity by about £6.3 million.
Some concern was expressed by ob-
servers that this sale cut off a good
source of profit. In 1962-63 Foy and
Gibson (WA) had had its most success-
ful year. It also could weaken the
group's buying strength.
The position of the directors in
having to make this decision is an un-
enviable one. They find trading extreme-
ly competitive and all the time hanging
over their heads is the obligation to
repay £1.9 million in deposits in this
current year, £4.0 million next year,
£3.9 million the year after, £3.8 million
in 1966-67 and £1.5 million a year
later. (This was the line-up of deposits
at last balance date, anyway.)
Fortunately none of the deposits were
repayable on call. In addition the group
had £3.4 million mortgage debenture
stock maturing on July 31, 1965.
Up to 1961-62, Cox Finance Cor-
poration Ltd was an associate company
but not a subsidiary. Under the Com-
panies Act 1961 it became a subsidiary,
but in 1962-63 Australian United Enter-
prises Pty Ltd, a subsidiary of Austra-
lian United Corporation Ltd, increased
its ordinary shareholding in Cox Finance
to 50 p.c., so that Cox Finance is no
longer a subsidiary of Cox Bros.
In the accompanying table, therefore,
Cox Finance has been treated each year
as an associate company for compara-
tive purposes. (In the six months to
January last, Cox Bros’ share of Cox
Finance profit was £58,000, but this was
not taken into account when directors
arrived at a group loss of £400,000.)
The group now consists of approxi-
mately 103 stores. The biggest money
profit earner is the parent, Cox Bros
(Aust.) Ltd, although this showed a
profit decline in 1962-63. Foy and
Gibson Ltd and subsidiaries (acquired
in 1955) represent about one-third of
total company activity, with profits also
falling except in Chadstone and Dande-
nong (Vic.).
Cox Brothers-Economic Stores of
Perth (still in the group) experienced a
profit decline. Waughs Pty Ltd of Wol-
longong and Foy Bilsons of Colac main-
tained profit in the year under review.
A new store for Cox-Foys of Ade-
laide was opened in November, 1962,
but apparently returns at July, 1963,
were not commensurate with the capital
investment. This was also the complaint
with Bright and Hitchcocks of Geelong,
and with the new Mildura store of
Bowrings (Aust.) Ltd and the new
Ballarat store of Morsheads Pty.
Georges Ltd, which handles the car-
riage trade of the group in Collins
Street, Melbourne, and which was taken
over in 1960-61, has achieved ten years’
expansion in three years. Directors said
it must now have a period of digestion.
(At least Cox Bros can be complimented
on maintaining the quality of this store
and effecting this considerable
expansion.)
The practice of allowing 10 p.c. dis-
count to shareholders with the requisite
qualification cost the group £354,000
in the first six months of the current
year. Shareholders appear to account
for about one-fifth of group sales.
Management may be fearful of losing
this custom, or a large part of it, by
abolishing the discount, although it is
about the only major retailer to offer
such benefits.
Cox Bros has had its crises before.
In 1956-57 it made only a small profit
and omitted ordinary dividends. There
was talk in 1957 of a partnership with
Great Universal Stores of Britain, after

an unsuccessful bid by the Waltons-
Sears group (as it was then), but this
came to nothing.
Selling off subsidiaries may stave off
trouble for a time, but it could leave
the group holding the least profitable
members.
If the investment in Cox Finance
could be sold at cost and its current
account eliminated, assuming there has
been no major change since last July
31, £2.8 million would be freed.
Stocks of £7.6 million and debtors of
£6.7 million (after reserve for doubtful
debts and provision for income yet to
mature), compared with sales of £32
million, suggest that the rate of stock
turn and collection of debts could be
improved.
It is Myers and David Jones which
set the pace for Cox Bros. David Jones
does not now divulge its turnovers, but
Myers turns its stock over about 7.6
times a year, whereas Cox Bros’ rate of
stock turn is only 4.2.
There is no easy solution to the
group’s problems. If the sale of more
properties can be arranged, Cox Bros
will gain time to put its house in order.
HILTON CORPORATION LTD
Hosiery Co. Still Diversifying
Future promises steady growth
HThe most prominent feature of Hilton
Corporation’s 1962-63 year was the
increasing reliance on products other
than hosiery. This diversification has
been going on since 1955 to counteract
growing competition in the hosiery field.
The current year is seeing an even stron-
ger trend in this direction and the link-
ing of Holeproof and Prestige, the two
biggest competitors, undoubtedly gives
reason for diversification to continue.
Apart from seamed and seamless
stockings, the Corporation now pro-
duces lingerie, women’s, men’s and
children’s socks, swimwear, casual
clothes and “Slip-ons” (a soft, casual
slipper for women and men), while one
division processes yarn for the group as
well as outside textile companies.
All these new activities have achieved
some measure of success. They are all
related in some way to the basic activity
at either manufacturing or retail level
and so there have been relatively few
problems in integrating them into group
thought and activity.
The one venture away from the tex-
tile industry failed and revealed to direc-
tors the dangers of too wide a diversifi-
cation. This was the acquisition in 1958
of P. C. Miller Forgings Pty Ltd, a
drop-forging engineer which held con-
tracts mainly with automotive concerns.
The credit squeeze took a heavy toll on
profit margins and directors found it
difficult to bring about a full recovery, so
operations have stopped and the assets
are being sold up.
However, it was not completely a
lack of the necessary experience which
prevented recovery. A Local Govern-
ment authority instituted legal proceed-
j ngs under a noise-ordinance by-law and
the plant was forbidden to operate after
6.30 p.m. This meant that the division
could not work its normal two shifts a
day, a practice which was necessary for
fully efficient operation. An expert was
engaged and he submitted plans to re-
duce the noise to a “reasonable” level
a t a cost of £60,000.
The directors did not consider that
this cost was warranted as the ordinance
did not provide for a minimum noise
level. This meant that the company
could be confronted with new litigation
after it had spent the money. So new
locations were surveyed and assessed,
but the existence of low profit margins
still made the board feel that any
further expense was unwarranted..
The current year has seen the intro-
duction of some new lines and it will be
the first full term of trading for “Slip-
ons”, “Pets” (runless, seamless, sheer
stockings), “Wonder Wools” (men’s
stretch socks that fit all sizes) and Supp-
hose for men (nylon socks which “help
prevent leg tiredness”). “Slip-ons” were
first marketed in April last year and
have proved to be a big success so far
and the demand for “Pets” is increasing
because they are apparently longer-
wearing than normal stockings but have
achieved this characteristic without any
loss of sheerness.
The new products this year are Van
Raalte lingerie and Cole of California's
swimwear and casual clothes. Hilton
has the exclusive rights to manufacture
and distribute these American-designed
products. Directors have said that, on
early indications, “a very encouraging
future lies ahead” for Van Raalte crea-
tions. “Cole” swimsuits are at present
the top-selling brand in the US. More-
over, this franchise seems assured of
success because every new season’s
style presented to Australian retailers
will have been market-tested for popular
acceptance in America’s winter cruise
and resort season.
“Further improvements” are expected
by Peerless Silk Mills Pty Ltd, the yarn
processing subsidiary. Increased demand
has been predicted by directors in line
with recovery in certain segments of
the textile industry. The huge stock
which this division is carrying is one of
the main reasons behind the big jump in
group stocks from £878,000 to
£1,248,000 shown on the balance sheet.
The success of this activity is largely
dependent on a continuous flow of yarn
through the mill. Disruption set in last
year when a supplier failed to make
deliveries and the firm was forced to
shop overseas —several weeks can pass
in this case before delivery is complete.
The local supply is now on tap again,
but apparently there is still the chance
of failure and so the company has stock-
piled in order to prevent any further
disruptions in the mill.
This is obviously a sound attitude to
take. But, on the other hand, the stocks
should be depleted as soon as directors
can see a clear road ahead in order to
release funds which could undoubtedly
earn more for the group elsewhere.
Probably the best use of such money
would be in reducing the bank over-
draft. Apparently this is where the cash
for the extra stocks came from in the

first place as the figure leapt from
£77,000 to £508,000 during the 1963
year. The big danger here is that the
company could find itself in the unfor-
tunate position of having to sell these
stocks at below balance-sheet value.
While stocks and bank overdraft
boosted current assets and current lia-
bilities respectively, the latter figure got
a further push through a move in un-
secured deposits from £lB,OOO to
£205,000. In fact the figure more than
doubled with the net effect of reducing
working capital from £1,025,000 to
£901,000. However, this situation is not
as bad as it looks. Unlike the over-
draft, the deposits were not new borrow-
ings but merely a conversion of loan
jcapital which the table shows has im-
proved no end from £244,000 to
£42,000, thus bringing gearing to an
extremely low level.
Moreover, although working capital
has been reduced, there is still ample to
keep the company moving on and re-
move the necessity of any further bor-
rowing. Generally, then, the group has
few, if any, liquidity worries.
The table also shows the steady
growth over the years in fixed assets
'and depreciation. The basic reason
behind this trend is the swing from
seamed to seamless stockings. The
latter require a completely new machine
while the old machines are so delicate
and specialised that they are only worth
their scrap-value once production ceases.
Nevertheless, there is some small com-
petition in the cheaper section of the
aosiery industry from “backyard manu-
tacturers” who have bought some dis-
carded machines for a song.
A spokesman for Hilton told The
Bulletin it was feasible that the com-
pany, in fact probably all the big manu-
facturers, may reach a stage where it
would be unprofitable to continue pro-
ducing seamed stockings. That is to say,
3f course, that the “backyard” men may
eventually be the only caterers for this
market. Originally, it was thought that
-he market would follow American lines
end settle to about 30 p.c. of the total.
However, demand for seamless is still
growing even though it is now around
p.c. of the total.
It seems that once the balance be-
tween the two becomes definitely known
then the expenditure on machinery will
eventually decrease in comparison with
recent years (Hilton has spent £650,000
Dn seamless equipment since the stock-
ings were first introduced) as the need
replacement declines and renewal
becomes the only expense. This situation
Wl *l bring about lower depreciation
charges which, in turn, will help create
higher profits.
Generally, the future for Hilton looks
'■ce one of steady growth—just as the
P as t has been in broad terms. It is true
that earnings have suffered compara-
tively in recent years, but now the com-
pany appears to have settled on firm
ground. Last year’s earnings were a
healthy 20 p.c. on paid capital which
has not moved since 1960. These ade-
quately covered a generous 134 p.c.
dividend and built reserves further still
so that now they are well in excess of
capital.
Probably the biggest worry at present
is the Prestige - Holeproof combine.
However, it seems that no drastic
changes will be made to Holeproof and
any extra attempts to take Hilton's mar-
ket are unlikely. Further diversification
looks like playing a continuing impor-
tant role in the Hilton camp and, as
long as this is not taken too far, success
seems assured.
SEBELS (AUSTRALIA) LTD
Unspectacular But Solid
A YIELD of 4.5 p.c. from a furniture
maker is exceptional, but that is
what is offering from the ss. shares of
Sebels (Aus ralia) Ltd, so long as they
sell around 16s. 6d.
Sebels specialises in furniture of
tubular metal, particularly chairs which
stack into a small space. Lately more
“important” tubular steel-framed chairs
and flat-fold tables have been deve-
loped.
Strong accent is placed by the com-
pany on design, and Sebels’ designs are
protected by registration or patents.
The company aims at a market which
considers design, durability and stability
of the product more important than the
initial price.
Clubs, hotels, restaurants and busi-
ness cafeterias are major customers.
From a loss position in 1952-53,
Sebels has developed a thriving business
and the latest profit for the 1963 calen-
dar year was a record £65,514 after
providing £41,984 for tax and £13,568
for depreciation. Earning rate is an
attractive 26.2 p.c. allowing an increase
in dividend rate from 124 to 15 p.c.
The company has not asked share-
holders to provide fresh capital at any
stage. In September, 1957, a one-for-
eight bonus was paid in lieu of a 124
p.c. dividend, and in October, 1961, a
one-for-nine bonus was made. Paid
capital was then and is now £250,000.
Trade debtors and stocks are notice-
ably greater this year than at the end
of 1962, signifying higher turnover.
Sebels claims that it has aimed at

steady but deliberatrly not spectacular

the company, which has a solid and
liquid financial structure. Shareholders
should be contented, too.
SPECULATOR’S DIARY
Back in the Market Business
Selling and shorting Pioneer Concrete
weekly gap has been my method
A of expressing contempt for the
market. Now I’m back in business full
time, determined to show that I’m not
beaten.
As an example of this newfound con-
fidence, I not only sold the 400 Pioneer
Concrete at 17s. after its shock an-
nouncement but shorted a further 1000
shares. You may remember I purchased
the Pioneer shares early in 1964 on the
anticipation of a very good trading year.
Judging by the interim report, this year’s
prospects do look very good. Then the
directors have to go and announce a
l-for-4 issue at 12s. 6d. (payable in full).
It reminds me of the RMC issue at 15s.
and the sterling effort there by the then
underwriters of the company to hold the
rights at 3d. For a tightly held stock
selling above 205., such an issue might
have been all right. But here you have
a company whose capital has already
been much enlarged by numerous take-
overs, placements, and issues direct to
shareholders.
From shorting one stock, I went on
to cover my existing short on Inter-
national Footwear. A £lO profit in a
couple of weeks was quite satisfactory
and partly offset the £l7 loss on Pioneer
Concrete.
Australian Chemicals was the last
stock to go, it also showing a loss of
£3l. It appears that the weakness in
the stock might have been caused by
an adverse tariff report.
Once I’d got this disappointing sell-
ing behind me and flushed by my tem-
porary success with James Hardie, I
decided to step into CSR to the extent
of 200 shares. Several points seem to
be in its favor. The most important, of
course, is that the market price is shap-
ing nicely for it to bounce above the
85s. level. Tracing the price history of
the stock we find that it took the first
few months of this year to break through
80s. Once broken it gathered accelera-
tion and quickly reached 85s. Now there
seems to be a temporary reaction. Soon
it should be off again.
The old-fashioned investor who thinks
that the share price should move in sym-
pathy with changes and expected changes
in earnings should also be satisfied with
an investment in CSR. Earning rate for
the year ended March 31 should be very
much higher than the 20 p.c. for the
previous year. The bulk of this increase
will definitely come from the substantial
rise in the world sugar price in the last
18 months. Also helping the profits
should be the increasing return from
the building materials division.
The immediate outlook for sugar and
building appears equally good. The
chemical side seems to be breaking even,
but that's about all. CSR Chemicals is
blaming dumping by Japan as the cul-
prit for this state of affairs. As it is also
Japan that has emerged as the major
customer for the sugar it all forms a
quaint picture.
If this was my solid purchase, then
my speculative buy was the 500 Petries
at 9s. Speculative, because the company
recently advised shareholders that there
were takeover discussions with another
company and that they should not sell.
This had the opposite effect, for volume
immediately increased understandably
at a slightly higher price. To me a pur-
chase at this stage is a reasonable
gamble.
Transactions for the week were:
SOLD
500 Australian Chemicals 19/- £467
1400 Pioneer Concrete 17/- £1172
BOUGHT
1000 International F’wear 9/9 £5OO
200 CSR 80/6 £Bl7
500 Petries 9/- £231
After these transactions my cash
backing is £3O and the portfolio is prob-
ably in better shape than it has been for
some time. Kelvinator, with a record
profit almost equalled by its tax provi-
sion. and Conquip, with an increase in
its interim dividend, both acquitted
themselves well over the last week.

THE MAN
ON THE LAND
Who Is This Simpson?
A thorn in the side of “Big Fellow ” Gunn
A guest at a Wool Board cocktail
party, should he wish to have his
-glass refilled, must be careful not to
mention the name “L. A. Simpson”.
Wool Board types are not too happy
on the subject of Mr Simpson, yet the
strange thing is that, in both manner
and dress, Lawrence A. Simpson is the
kind of man one would expect to find at
Wool House.
He wears the kind of suits which are
featured in those advertisements design-
ed to promote wool and which are sub-
sidised heavily by the Wool Board and
the International Wool Secretariat.
Yet Simpson is an implacable foe of
the Wool Board and the IWS. Who is he
and why is it so?
He is the managing director of Now-
ranie Pastoral Co. Pty Ltd at Oaklands,
in the NSW Riverina. He is a grazier,
or, to be more exact, a squatter. There
is a difference.
Anyone who has enough money can
become a grazier by buying a sufficiently
large station property. If he buys enough
of them he can become a pastoralist. It
does not matter really where the money
comes from. It could be from a chain
of shops or even SP bookmaking.
But to be a squatter it is necessary to
have both the big property and to have
been born to it. The right kind of school
tie is rather essential.
The severest criticism of the “squat-
tocracy” is that it, as a class, avoids
public life. Its members are content to
manage their stations and to devote their
surplus energies to such things as racing,
polo and lengthy trips abroad. Skiing
and motor racing are also acceptable. So
1S the collecting of expensive paintings.
Simpson and, for that matter, the
chairman of the Wool Board, Sir
William Gunn, are notable exceptions to
me rule. (There are others, of course.)
ut relatively similar backgrounds
are all that these two gentlemen have in
common.
Mr Simpson is a big squatter. His
amily property, Nowranie, runs about
s >ooo sheep which might bring in
£40,000 a year, give or take a few
thousand.
In an enigmatic way, however, Mr
Simpson has waged a constant campaign
against the policies of the Wool Board
(and the Bureau before it) and the In-
ternational Wool Secretariat for about
five or six years.
He is not against either body in prin-
ciple, nor is he against promotion en-
tirely, either. But he contends that the
Wool Board and the IWS have erred in
placing promotion first and marketing
second. He contends—and this amounts
almost to heresy in the Wool Board—
that the “price relationship” between
wool and synthetics is unproven, and,
in fact, invalid.
He has figures which show that con-
sumption of wool is lowest, compara-
tively, in those countries where promo-
tion has been highest (e.g., the US). But
in countries where there has been little
or no promotion, wool consumption has
risen.
He says that synthetics are largely in
competition with cotton.
Terylene dropped 20 p.c. a pound at
the beginning of this year, while wool
rose almost continuously until Easter.
Simpson has written a book and many
brochures on the benefits of a reserve
price scheme for wool marketing. These
he published at his own expense. Initially
he had no body or organisation behind
him. He does not say, however, that his

scheme is the one which should neces-
sarily be adopted. He wants a ballot of
all growers so that they can decide.
This is not what is happening, of
course.
HThe Wool Board has set up a market-
A ing committee which will report to
the Australian Wool Industry Confer-
ence on four major marketing systems—
the present free auction system, a re-
serve price system, an acquisition sys-
tem and an appraisement system.
In July the AWIC will consider this
report and decide what changes, if any,
are to be implemented. There may be a
ballot and there may not. If there is a
ballot, the type (two-thirds majority or
something else) will be in itself a thorny
topic.
In the meantime, of course, the
AWIC has voted 40 to 10 in favor of a
fourfold increase in the promotion levy
■ — at the request of the IWS and the
seven bills to implement this at Govern-
ment level are currently before Federal
Parliament.
Lawrence Simpson is severely critical
of this entire deal. The grower (and the
taxpayer), he says, are now committed
to increase promotion to the tune of £ll
million to promote a product which is
already in short supply and with abso-
lutely no guarantee of a minimum re-
turn to the grower.
In voting 40 to 10 the AWIC (com-
posed of 25 delegates each from the
Woolgrowers’ and Graziers’ Council and
the Australian Meat and Wool Producers’
Federation) could not have seriously con-
sidered known facts, he says. It was in-
fluenced by the “promote promotion
salesmen”, including Sir William Gunn,
Mr W. J. Vines (director IWS) and Mr
R. G. Lund (European director).
The “synthetics tag”, he says, was a
kind of salesman’s clincher.
He does much more than say this,
however. He produces tables, charts and
figures to support his criticisms. It is
these figures which cause the Wool Board
and the IWS concern because, while the
PR boys can cope with “sticks and
stones”, figures are much more difficult
to answer.
Simpson gets a good Press in some
ways; , in other ways a poor one. Rural
journals, with time and the specialised
staff to digest his often laboriously com-
piled statistics, give him a good hearing.
But city dailies are much more impress-
ed by the Wool Board hand-outs which
naturally, as they are presented by pro-
fessionals, are designed for the rapid
handling necessary on a daily.
Some years ago Simpson was active
in the Graziers’ Association (he was
president of the Riverina branch), but
for reasons which have never been made
very clear he withdrew from active par-
ticipation in its affairs and began a
“lone wolf” campaign as a critic, both
as writer and speaker.
This has denied him his chance of
getting where he could do the most
good on the AWIC itself or on the
Wool Board.
ITow does a man get on the Wool
Board? First he must be one of
those 50 delegates to the AWIC. To
do this he must join the State equiva-
lents of the two bodies composing
the AWIC. He must attend enough
meetings and make enough impact
to induce the executive members of
these bodies to make him a delegate.
It is just bad luck if he belongs to
one of the unaffiliated bodies, such as
the Australian Primary Producers’
Union, which do not get guernseys on
the AWIC.
The AWIC elects the six grower
members who form the nucleus of the
Wool Board. There was a time when
Simpson might have got on to the Board
as a co-opted member with “special
qualifications”. The deputy-chairman, Mr
A. N. Armstrong, who is a Common-
wealth Banking Corporation executive,
was brought in in this manner. But the
breach has widened to such an extent
that this is now most unlikely for
Simpson.
There are many woolgrowers who
claim that the AWIC should be elected
on a regional basis by all woolgrowers
in open ballot, instead of being appointed
by the executives of the two major
organisations. Should this ever come
about, Simpson might find himself
thrust into the limel'ght.
He has achieved what his critics said
was the impossible. He is getting support
now from small growers as well as large;
from mixed farmers as well as squatters.
He has done this with no attempt at
backslapping or making a good fellow
of himself. It is his facts and
which do the talking for him.
These have overcome the initial a®,
picion of many smaller growers
man as wealthy as Lawrence Simp®
just couldn’t be on their side. Ck
barriers exist more than most Awfe
lians like to admit particularly ioft
bush where it is supposed to be i
“mateship”.

blunt and to the point. He has Hi
woolgrowers at meetings that he, pm®
ally, it able to beat the auction systa
because he is big enough. He, in far
exercises his own personal reserve prik
scheme by withdrawing his wool if I
does not like the price, and putter
back when the price is right. Other li
wool growers have been doing the sat
thing.
But the average woolgrower and ifi
small woolgrower cannot afford to a
this. He must sell and if he happen it
strike a bad day he might drop £7ooa
£ 1000, which is a lot of money to a *
trying to pay off a farm which cost Mi
too much in the first place.
Simpson says that most woolgrow
work on a profit margin of 3 p.c. I
own profit margin is greater than t
because his family acquired Nowranir
long time ago. He could run Shelia:
ponies instead of sheep and still c®n
out ahead.
He is opposed to the auction svsi
as it exists now, he says, because it
intrinsically wrong. It is set up i
gamblers and eventually it must drag::
wool industry backwards, he says.
An indication of the kind of influeti;
Simpson has may be illustrated by It

,ity Simpson was not on the AWIC.
3ut any likelihood of that (as far as
'junn is concerned) would have gone out
he window when Simpson only recently
illied himself with a new group called
he Australian Growers’ Wool Marketing
Committee.
With headquarters in Canberra, this
>ody is actively campaigning for a ballot
if growers forthwith on a reserve price
Scheme. It has no doubts that the vote
/ould be overwhelmingly in favor of a
|eserve price.
Besides Simpson, the two main forces
n this body appear to be Mr F. Eric
Hitchins, of Western Australia, and Mr
Alan W. Campbell, of Brisbane.
Hitchins has himself written a book
on wool marketing, and in this most
intricate business he could tie some Wool
Board people in knots. He is a former
president of the Wool and Meat Pro-
ducers’ Federation.
Alan W. Campbell is the managing
director of the Queensland Primary Pro-
ducers’ Co-operative Association and is
therefore very close to both wool selling
and broking.
The trio is a formidable one and may
become increasingly so.
Hopes for the Wadham Plan
Apprenticeships in agriculture
Dir Samuel Wadham, a most respected
r writer on matters associated with
Igriculture, has put forward what is be-
ing termed the “Wadham Plan” to en-
tourage a form of apprenticeship for
oungsters in primary industry.
1 There is no doubt that farming gener-
llly is sorely in need of competent work-
| rs. But that is the rub. They are
workers.
Sir Samuel, being of an older genera-
ion, may be unaware that these days
alary and opportunity are not enough,
itatus is the thing.
This is the age of the “junior trainee
xecutive”, the “co-ordinator”, the “con-
unner expeditor” and other odd fish not
o mention the “lubritorium director”.
There are plenty of jobs going on the
and. Here are a couple of such posi-
ions as advertised in the “Situations
/acant” columns of a rural journal.
“Farmer/tractor driver wanted.
Permanent position. Riverina. Must
have sound experience of farming,
machinery, irrigation. Good wages.
Furnished house, electricity, school.
Apply, etc.”
“Farmhand with dairying experi-
ence required for modern farm,
Western District. Family man pre-
ferred. House supplied. Own
transport desirable.”
No nonsense here. The ads describe
exactly what the jobs are likely to entail,
the owners of the properties are
loubtless still advertising.
Compare this with an advertisement
or a position in a large manufacturing
; ompany:
“The man we are seeking will
have had appropriate direct experi-
ence within a large company; he is
essentially an all-rounder but has
specific strengths and knowledge in
some or all of the functions desig-
nated. The preferred age range is
in the early to middle thirties. Not-
withstanding this we do not wish to
deter from applying younger men,
who whilst not having perhaps had
long experience in the field, never-
theless feel they are ready to be
given their chance in a position of
responsibility.”
This is only part of the build-up. Cut-
ting through all the gibberish, it appears
that what is wanted is a young bloke
who will fit in as an assistant to the
assistant to the chief of the department
of a large concern.
Increasingly we seem to be accepting
this kind of language. Peas are no
longer peas. They are “garden-fresh-
peas” (out of packets).
A car is no longer brown in color. It
is “autumn-tint-brown”.
There are countless other examples.
But apart from this type of thing, one
of the real problems with getting people
to work in the country is the attitude of
farmers —and their wives—to employees.
Sometimes the relationship is excel-
lent. All too often the farm worker is
relegated to being a menial. Even when
the money—with keep provided—is
attractive, many farm workers prefer a
factory job as soon as they can get one.
If Sir Samuel Wadham’s apprentice-
ship plan can overcome this barrier, it is
to be commended and given every en-
couragement. In many European coun-
tries similar plans exist.
Increasingly, however, the farm work-
er lives in a nearby town and drives to
work like any factory employee. His
hours are regular. He has a strong
union behind him. The farms also are
increasingly adopting a factory outlook.
Although the trend is not unknown
in Australia, it may take a little time to
be really felt. Not that long, however.
It is apparent already in vegetable grow-
ing and in poultry. Dairying and pigs
are likely to be next.
At this stage some serious thought at
least should be given to the apprentice-
ship idea.
Support would probably come from
the farm equipment and machinery
manufacturers. With the “big stuff”
these days, more than just being able to
drive the thing is necessary. Farm
maintenance of equipment also is often
of the most cursory kind.
In the future better and bigger equip-
ment may be expected and proper train-
ing would both increase safety and
proper economic usage.
The apprenticeship system would not
cut across the work being already done
by the agricultural colleges and these
colleges might prove very useful in
formulating training requirements.
