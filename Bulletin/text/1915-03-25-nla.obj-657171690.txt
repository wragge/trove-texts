“ALONE WITH HIS GOD."
—A “Kultur Cartoon” by Will Dyson.
Will Dyson’s Kultur
Cartoons (Paul, 25.)
are, so far, the most
striking product of the
cartoonist’s art on the
side of the Allies
evoked by the war.
H. G. Wolls provides
a foreword. “He has
said in a thousand
cartoons how disgust-
ing it is to be a ‘fat
man’ in a world of
ignoble advantages.
Can you really keep
on as you are keeping
on after I have drawn
you like this ?.... So
in this war Mr. Dyson
takes a figure based on
the Kaiser, but essen-
tially a symbol, on
which to concentrate
his hatred of the fool-
ish assumptions, the
cruel vanities, the vile
waste of opportunity,
the perversion and de-
struction, which is his
case against militant
monarchy. I could
wish he were given the
task of the Kaiser’s
court painter, for in-
deed he would make a
record that would kill
regal ambition to the
very end of time....
Was there ever a com-
pleterand j u s t e r
repudiation of the
belligerent theorv of
life?” H. G. Wells also
mentions Will Dyson’s
devil; but Dyson’s
devil is Norman Lind-
say’s devil. This book
of cartoons strikes us
as unfair. Dyson’s art has been- strengthened
by his study of the brutality of the German
cartoonists ; and now he turns this German
brutality of his pen upon the Prussian him-
self. He is hitting the Kaiser with his o\vn
Aveapons; but the man behind the gun is
still Will Dyson. Australian.
Fiction
This page bade farewell to Compton
Mackenzie in the middle of his first volume
of Sinister Street. “Art,” we pointed out
to this interminable writer, “is selection”;
and in his postscript to the second volume
of Sinister Street (Bell, per W. Dymock,
Sydney) Mackenzie quotes the definition, as
coming from The Bulletin, “a curious
antipodean paper.” Our objection to the
first volume was not that it was too long,
but that it was dull. The same objection
applies to the second volume. The soul of
the hero, a loafer ou an ample income, a
prig and a fool, is not worth this exhaustive
and exhausting analysis r nor is Compton
Mackenzie’s method of interminable conver-
sations an artistic means of diagnosis. Sin-
ister Street is merely a narrative, without
the semblance of a plot, of the youth of a
boy whose future is a matter of supreme
indifference to the reader who succeeds in
wading through its thousand pages.
In his apology the author insists that
Sinister Street is not thinly disguised auto-
biography, which, after all, would be some
excuse for its lack of plot and its formless-
ness. He states that his book is a novel-
and, therefore, it is implicitly an attempt
at a work of art. In that attempt lie has
palpably failed. “If I were to set down all
I could remember of my; childhood,” he
states, “the book would not by this time
have reached much beyond my fifth year.”
But it would have been a better book, for it
would have not pretended to be a work of
art. Even as it is, the last page finds his
hero only 23. “The theme of Sinister Street
is the youth of a man who presumably will
be a priest.” Our troubles! “Whether or
not it was worth writing at such length
depends finally, I claim, upon the number
of people who can bear to read it.” He will
have to deduct one reader, at least, from his
list. Evidently Compton Mackenzie has
attempted to make a selection in order to
produce a work of art: our quarrel with
him that he has not allowed the principle
of selection a fair chance. It is not as if
the author does not know how to produce his
effect by an economy of means. No writer
has a license to bore.
Yet there is, for us Australasians, an inter
est in the second volume —an interest ex-
traneous to the author’s purport. He has
succeeded in conveying, by his sheer garru-
lity, an impression of the utter futility of
Oxford. Michael, his hero, is presumably
the ideal Oxford product. He has a theory
that “a gentleman leavens the great popular
mass of humanity, and however superficially
useless he may seem, his existence is a
pledge of the immanence of the idea. Popu-
lar education has fired thousands to prove
themselves not gentlemen in the present
meaning of the term, hut something much
finer than any gentleman we know anything
abo-ut. And they are not, they simply and
solidly are not.” Which settles the matter
according to Oxford. And on the Rhodes
Scholars the Oxford undergraduate is simply
delicious. One character refers to them as
“a lot of foreigners.” Michael thinks that
Oxford will change the Rhodes Scholars
much more profoundly than the Rhodes
Scholars will change Oxford; but concedes
that Oxford “would cure them of being sur-
prised by themselves or of showing surprise
at anybody else.... Also they will gain a
sense of humor, or rather they will ripen
whatever sense they already possess. . . .Per-
haps they’ll take as much interest in the
world as in Australia.” The world, of
course, is Oxford. “I’m so positive that the
best of Oxford is the best of England, and
that the best of England is the best, of
humanity.” And in that stagnant back-
water of the great stream of modern life,
where the inhabitants do nothing but dis-
cuss themselves and, instead of living,
futilely argue about life, the possibility that
the advent of the Rhodes Scholars would
transform a provincial university into an
imperial one is regarded with distinct, annoy-
ance. The idea of an imperial university is
“ghastly.” Michael figures “something like
the Imperial Institute filled with Colonials
eating pemmican. The Eucalyptic Vision, it
might be called.”
It is evident that the Ivaisdr declared war
not a moment too soon —for Oxford.
The second part of this volume touches
life more nearly. Michael—whose trouble
all along is mental laziness and the lack of
any necessity to earn his own living—en-
gages in a sentimental quest for the soul—-
and the body—-of Lily Iladen, a girl whom
he kissed some six hundred pages earlier
in life.. She had adopted a profession that
aptly parallels the mental prostitution of
Michael. Michael explores the slums in
search of her; but he carries with him
almost the equipment of an Antarctic ex-
plorer, and when the underworld offends his
delicate soul he scurries back to his luxu-
rious home. Ultimately, after a number
of experiences in the slums that are bril-
liantly described by the author, chance leads
him to Lily. He determines to marry her,
despite—or, rather, because of —her past.
But Lily is Lily, a lady of dead easy yirtue ;
and the inevitable discovery of the other
man's- silk hat hanging in the hall of the
flat he had takeh for his future wife puts
an end to his vague romanticism. So at 23
we leave Michael —with a sigh of relief.
“It is obvious that were I to continue
the life of Michael Fane to the end of his
seventy-second year,”- Compton Mackenzie
remarks, “his story would run into 20 vol-
umes as thick as Sinister Street.' My inten-
tion, however, was not to write a life, but
the prologue of a life. He is growing up on
the last page, and for me his interest begins
to fade.” For this reader his interest has
completely evaporated, and long before the
last page. The author remarks that Michael
may become a Benedictine monk or a society
preacher. Let us fervently hope that he
enlisted.
The grande prix de litterdture, founded in
1910 by the Academie Franqaise, was
awarded, for the first time, in 1912 to Andrd
Lafon, for his novel, now translated under
the title of Jean Gillies, Schoolboy (Bell).
The grande prix is worth £4OO, and the win-
ing book must be “of a high moral tone.”
Obviously a prize for wowsers. Lafon, its
hitherto unknown author, is a sort of under-
master at a boys’ college. His hero is “him-
self, phis imagination,” a nervous, morbid
youth, who tells the uneventful story of his
schooldays in a literary style simple and pel-
lucid. _ There is throughout the suggestion
that his father is mad; the evidences of this
tragedy slowly accumulate till the father
commits suicide. That is all the plot. The
book is made up of the schoolboy’s descrip-
tion of his trivial life, the impression's made
on his simple mind by the gradual unfolding
of the world around him. The book is, to
any reader hut a Frenchman, wearisome and
dull. It manages to suggest the mind of the
child, and its literary art is doubtless im-
peccable—in French; hut its simplicity is
overdone to the verge of childishness. If
J can Gillies is the sort, of literature that the
Academie Frangaise prizes, it is obvious that
the time was ripe for this war. The next
prize-winning work will presumably have a
little of the red blood of life in ,it.
Stephen Leacock’s humor remains fresh.
His Arcadian Adventures with the Idle Rich
(Lane, per W. Dymock, Sydney) As just as
delightful as his Sunshine Sketches of a
Little Town; his touch is just as delicate;
but though, with his more blatant subjects,
the idle rich of the United States, he has
more opportunities for irony, he still dips his
pen in genial, sunshine. The N’York idle rich
are themselves the richest thing in Ameri-
can humor. Leacock has merely pinned them
down in all their crudity in print; it can
hardly he said that he caricatures them;
they do it themselves. And though the moral
of his sermon is never obtruded, it is always
there. Leacock compels laughter, but it is
thoughtful laughter.
His subjects live in Plutoria Avenue, or
in palaces in the country, and dine at the
Mausoleum Club- And in Plutoria Avenue
“you may see a little toddling princess who
owns 50 distilleries in her own right. There,
in a lacquered perambulator, sails past a
little hooded head that controls from its
cradle an entire New Jersey corporation.
The United Stages Attorney-General is suing
her as she sits, in a vain attempt to make
her dissolve herself into constituent com-
panies: Near by is a child of four, iu a
khaki suit, who represents the merger of two
trunk-line railways. Incalculable infants
wave their fifty-doll a r ivory rattles in an in-
articulate greeting to one another. , A million
dollars of preferred stock laughs merrily in
recognition of a majority control going past
in a go-cart drawn by an imported nurse....
Just below Plutoria Avenue the trees die out
and the brick and stone of the city begin in
earnest. Even*from the avenue you see the
tops of the sky-scraping buildings and the
big, commercial streets, and can hear the
roar of the elevated railway, earning divi-
dends” ....
Delightful are the inhabitants of this ter-
restrial paradise of dollars. There is Mr.
Rasselyer-Brown, who drank. He was not a
drunkard, of course-—nobody so rich as Mr.
liasselyer-Brown could be called a drunkard.
“He began the day, of course, with an eye-
opener—and, after all, what alert man does
not wish his eyes well open in the morning?
He followed it usually just before breakfast
with a bracer—and wliat wiser precaution
can a business man take than to brace his
breakfast? On his way to business he gener-
ally had his motor stopped at the Grand
Palaver for a moment, if it was a raw day,
arrd dropped in and took Something to keep
out the damp. If it, was a cold day he took
something to keep out the cold, and if it was
one of those clear, sunny days that are so
dangerous to, the system he took whatever
the bar-tender (a recognised health-expert)
suggested to tone the system up.”-
There are the Newberrys, who belonged
to the class of people whose one aim in
summer is to lead the simple life. “This
was why he had built Castel Casteggio. It :
stood about 40 miles from the city, out
among the wooded hills on the shore of a
little lake. Except for the 20 residences
like it that dotted the sides of the lake, it
was entirely isolated. The only way to
reach it was by the motor road from the
railway station 15 miles away. Every foot
of the road was private property, as all
nature ought to he. The whole country
about Castel Casteggio was absolutely
primeval, or at any rate as primeval as
Scotch gardeners and French landscape
artists could make it. The lake itself lay
like a sparkling gem from Nature’s workshop
-—except that they had raised the level of it
ten feet, stone-banked the Rides, cleared out
the brush and put a motor road round it.
Beyond that it was pure nature.”
Charmingly arcadian is the story of the
merger 6£ two rival churches, the Episco-
palian and the Presbyterian, in Plutoria
Avenffe. The new Presbyterian minister
preached Hell so energetically that the Epis-
copalian church was deserted. Why not
make a combine? As one of the directors
said: “We have here practically the same
situation as we have had with two rum
distilleries—the output is too large for the
demand. One or both of the two concerns
must go under.” There was, it is true, some
difficulty in drawing up the articles —ques-
tions concerned with disputed beliefs
held by the rival adherents on subjects like
the Creation and eternal punishment. These,
however, were happily settled. The article
upon eternal punishment read: “Should any
doubts arise, on or after August first
proximo, as to the existence of eternal pun-
ishment, they shall be settled absolutely and
finally by a pro rata vote of all the holders
of common and preferred stock, hut no form
of eternal punishment shall be declared valid
if displeasing to a three-fifths majority of
the holders of bonds.”
Delicious fooling, but with a sting in it.
•
“The" Pariah”:—
A poetess has no profit in her own country. In
The Australasian of January 30 “Literary Notes”
say, “Under the simple hut expressive title ‘Socks’
Nina Murdoch writes the following women’s war
verses in T.P.’s Weekly.” Then follows the verse
which was written for Sydney Sun in the first month
of the war. T.P. might have given Australia the
advertisement, hut if he did. The Australasian
failed to notice it. Nearly every provincial rag in
Victoria—nine to my knowledge—-printed “Socks”
months ago.
Cryptic J. Brennan’s Poems
“Austin Biff” has come to the rescue of
this page, which failed to discover any mean-
ing in a passage quoted from that poet’s
Poems. “Austin Biff” is the only person
who has, which is a tribute either to Bren-
nan’s poetry or to his obscurity. “A. Biff”
is hereby appointed the president of the
Cryptic J. Brennan Society, which, if it
goes on like this, ought to leave the Brown-
ing Society helpless and gasping.
The “Red Page” may be pardoned for acknowledging
ignorance of the hidden meaning that the above poet
so cleverly and poetically conveys in many of his out-
bursts. The writer, not claiming supernatural powers
of comprehension, offers the following suggestion as
to the meaning or theme of one item that seemingly
troubles The Bulletin critic.
The item referred to opens:—
“0 thou that achest, pulse of the unwed vast,
now in the distant centre of. my brain....’’
Is it not feasible that the author used the words
“unwed vast” to express the unfettered condition of
the will of thought that every human being is alleged
to possess? Then we have:—
“....dizzily narrow’d, now beyond the last
calm circle widening of the starry plain,
where, on the scattered edge of my surmise....”
I gather that Brennan means to convey to the reader
that the one great thought that forms the theme of
his offering, has so monopolised his imagination that
“the unwed vast” is at last a slave to itself, and he
no longer possesses that freedom of thought that was
once his. All his surmises are narrowed down to the
one object, which we learn later is a lunatic desire
to discover a “citadel where 1 would be distinct.”
His imagination tells him there is such a place, but
his mental quest for the mythical citadel is in vain.
However this is anticipatory.
“... .The twilight dreams fail off and rule is spent
vainly on vagrant bands the gulfs iijvite
to break away to the dark: they, backward sent,
though dumb, with dire infection in their eyes,
startle the central seat:....”
At this point he confesses that his distant dream
is nothing more than a dream. The vagrant bands
are doubtless the legion of ideas that cloud the brain
from the original thought, and they come at the
invitation of the gulfs, or blank regions, that are
centred in his mind and oppose any idea that his
imagination may present, that would serve to en-
lighten him on the object of his dreaming. They
come though backward sent, meaning of course that
he did not know of their coming' until they were
firmly rooted in his mind. Hence the expression:
“....though dumb, with dire infection in their
eyes.” Once they make themselves known there
is no deliverance from their companionship. They
remain, as twice mentioned in the poem as gulfs, or
impassable objects that debar him from continuing
his original train of thought.
Continuing:—
“... .0 pulse of night, that •
when the noon world is fused in’fire and blent
with my then unattained hero-m00d....”
The only answer to this seems to be that the poet
writing whilst in the course of his dreaming, is
anxious to know what the morrow will bring forth,
and what peace will he be allowed from “thou that
achest, pulse of the unwed vast.” As his dream was
born at night he addresses his plaint to the “pulse
of night,” and continues: —
“....what will with me the imperious instinct ,
that hounds the gulfs together on that place,
banishing utterly out of mortal trace,
the citadel where I would seem distinct....”
The _ imperious instinct is the unwelcome, but pre-
dominant idea that places the obstacles, or gulfs, in
his train of thought, with the ultimate result that his
mind becomes clouded and he loses trace of the
citadel that his mind was building for him.
“..if not thou ween’st a vanity, my deep,
unlighted still, the which thy refluent sweep
intolerably dilates, a tide that draws
with lunatic desire, distraug-ht and fond. ...”
The poet, asks for peace from the troubling imag-
ination of his own mind in order that he may, with-
out hindrance, conjure in his brain that lunatic
desire, at the same time admitting that his vain
wish is tinged with vanity.
And blaming the night for the conception of the
wish, he pleads for mercy from the intolerable long-
ing and seeking for the agony of night, which is
accompanied by his hallucination
“.... to some dark moon of vastness, hung beyond
our little limits of familiar cause,
as though the tense and tortured voids should dash
ruining amorously together, a clash
portentous with some rose of thinnest flame
secret, exhaled in the annull’d abyss....”
Again that mention of the citadel beyond the
ordinary walks of life. Brighter than all else is his
cherished “somewhere,” likened to the moon, and yet
dark and invisible to the ordinary mortal. And should
the two imaginary objects, the brains presenting the
different ideas, and the voids that contain the
imangined gulfs, should they clash, the poet is assured
that spme light would penetrate the dark recesses of
his mind, and he would be at peace.
He evidently accepts death as the only release from
“thou that achest... .in the centre of my brain.” He
realises that death would follow that clashing of the
opposing brain forces, and so continues:—
. .that with this soul, passes in that fell kiss,
and to that the soft-sprung- flush of all sanctity-
surrenders. ...”
Then this most obscure of all poets tells us that
his soulful mind soars to above regions after death
in this world, and finds there no uniting heart to
help reveal the cherished citadel. Only the wings of
oblivion, as on earth, can grant him- happiness. He
expresses himself:—
centring in the blossom’d name,
as the dark wings of silence lovingly
hover above the adventurous song that fares
forth to the void and finds no lip that shares
its rapture, just the great wing spreading wide.”
In conclusion, the poet may have meant the “void”
to represent the earth he had just left, giving us to
understand that what we long for in this world we
will also long for in the next. He is certainly not to
be placed beyond the pale cf eccentric poets. How-
ever his obscurity, eccentricity and poetry are all
interesting subjects, and will give many readers food
for thought.
There! And now will somebody please
explain “Austin Biff’s” explanation? But
no : why should it be explained? It is per-
fect as it is.

STOPS PAIN
It is the doctors’ remedy. It was discovered, by a
noted doctor—is used by doctors —prescribed by doc-
tors —and most enthusiastically endorsed by doctors.
It does not affect he heart action. It can be safely
taken in large doses for exceptionally bad cases, and
it is proved to be totally and .wholly harmless. It is
guaranteed under the IST.S.W. Pure Pood Act, 1908,
and its use does not disappoint. (Made in Australia.)
Experience has taught us that, once used, no other
remedy has a chance of substituting it.

The Mopoke.
Across the moon,
The shadow of the moon,
The reeds are trembling with the plaintive
croon,
Mopoke! Mopoke!
Between dark trees the creek is glimmering;
And when the mists rise, and the half-lights
cling,
The forest-dweller hears your strange, sad
tune,
Across the moon,
Mopoke! Mopoke!
The shadow of the moon.
Across the moon,
The shadow of the moon,
The night winds sigh, the tall reeds sway
and swoon.
Mopoke! Mopoke!
Wandering winds, the withering of grass,
And cry of trees and' streams, before man
was —
Older than human grief, the grief you
croon—
Across the moon,
Mopoke! Mopoke!
The shadow of the moon.
Across the moon,
The shadow of the moon,
Your cry is whispered to the lone lagoon ;
Mopoke! Mopoke!
With far-off sadness, wild Earth’s undertone,
O melancholy cry on low pipe blown!
The sadness in the heart of Nature’s rune,
Across the moon,
Mopoke! Mopoke!
The shadow of the moon.

2 A.M.
Dozing in the double bed.
Just a hinted lamplight glow,
Lest the little one awake.
Oh, the lonely, lonely ache,
Must it be for ever so?
Make no murmur, bow the head ;
Love is dead.
Soundly sleeps the little one,
Soundly sleeps the wife beside ;
Slow, slow, 510 w.... the moments crawl.
How the silence seems to bawl ;
Love is dead and when She died,
Horror, blacking out the sun,
Made us one.
Dead men lying all around,
Still as mummies, do not move,
Staring at the ceiling’s white ;
Could I only reach the light,
Well I know that I could prove
Silence does not make a sound,
Death confound.
Ilnsh, my heart. . . .and who is she,
Dreamy-footed, holy-eyed,
Through the still unopened door
Creeps across the bedroom floor —
Lifts the counterpane aside,
Gives the child a kiss ? Ah me!
Can it be?
What reproof her eyes aver,
In her look what desert pain,
Gazing down at me awhile,
Then her virgin-mother smile,
Leaning o’er the child again.
What does memory disinter,
Seeing her?
Tick, tick, tick —the moments fly;
All the dead men, stark upright,
Stand and dance upon my bed,
On the floor and overhead,
In the livid quarter-light,
Quick, to reach the lamp I’ll try,
Or I die.
Jumping up, I snatch at it,
Oozing sweat from every pore—
Turn the light up ; all are fled ;
Wife and child lie in the bed,
Sleeping soundly as before.
Courage, now the room is lit,
Stirs a whit.
Out of bed and draw the blind ;
Greasy twilight slithers in.
Then again to bed I creep,
Doze a while and off to sleep.
What, I wonder, is the sin
I’ve committed or designed?
... .Never mind !
MAORI!,AND.
BERNARD INGLEBY.
Aching Trousers.
When my year-old trousers bag
At the knees ;
When my coat and waistcoat sag
As they please;
Then I seem to feel them ache.
And I think “For goodness sake,
To the old clothes cupboard take
This old wheeze!”
When my coat is stained and frayed,
How it smarts!
When my pants with nails are stayed,
All the arts
Can’t distract my tortured mind ;
To all gracious things I’m blind
And the world seems all unkind,
Flinty hearts.
When my soles are wearing through
I am lame,
And the pavement seems all blue,
Dancing flame!
I feel helpless, poor and mean—
Just a worn-out old machine,
And my countenance is green
With my shame.
Why a-man should be depressed
By old clothes
Is a puzzle I give best!
I suppose
That my confidence must fly
When I’m shabby. An old tie.
Makes me sink and want to die.
Why, Lord knows!

GOOD SPORTSMEN need GOOD GUNS
The Shooter who
is fond of the
sport is the most
particular man as.
to his equipment,
and it is only
right that he
should be so, for
a poor equipment
may mean disas-
ter. The first
requirement is a
good Gun.
Here is a 12-
bore Gun that can
be relied on, made by Greener. This Double-barrelled Hammerless Gun is fitted with an
entirely new type of specially-designed and patented action.
The Barrels are made of a special-Quality Steel (known in Greener’s factory as X
quality), forged in full length, and drilled from the solid; extra-long and broad-bearing
surface on Barrel Lumps. . - . . „ ,
The Patent Locks give the maximum of efficiency, with the minimum of wear, ana
the arrangement for cocking directlv off the fore-end on to the mainsprings gives
extreme simplicity, and allows of that most desirable feature—a sound, screwed joint pin
to brace the action together, and a broad, solid joint to which the fore-end is suitaoiy
and efficiently held up.
The stock is of European Walnut, with pistol hand grip.

HELL'S MENU
The Devil sat and stroked his tail,
And listened to tho howl and wail.
“ By Eden's Snake,” he said at last,
** Hell’s business is growing fast.
We haven’t got a grid to spare,
Although on some I’ve packed a pair.
Nine months ago things were so slow
I nearly let the license go;
But now, the way trade’s pouring in—
Great Sulphur I What an awful din I ”
Just then the chef dashed through the
door 1
And cast himself upon the floor:
44 Great Lord of Flame and Sheol’s Hob,
1 must resign—l chuck the job.
You hear those cursing souls without?
Just mark their furious yell and shout.
They’re there in tens of thousands—
more!
Each day arrives a thousand score!
And, though I’ve tried by day and night
To satisfy their appetite
With roast and grill and boiled and—
well,
Most everything we’ve got in Hell,
They growl like dogs, dread lord, and so
Give me my wage and let me go.
No cook could stand the strain for long,
However healthy he and strong,

WANTED —A BUREAU OF
PROPHECY.
The business of the professional prophet is
sadly neglected in these days. No wild
person with a surplus of whiskers cries in
the market place an account of the events
of the year after next, mixing his elaborate
metaphors and similes in a fierce denuncia-
tion of the ways of Darling Point and
Toorak. No priestess on the tripod stool
of Delphi gives cryptic answers to all in-
quiries ; no Cassandra shrieks her burning
message in the streets. Of course, there is
the Commonwealth Weather Bureau mak-
ing its useful guesses as to the amount of
wind and rain a day may bring forth, and
in secret places there are pale, witch-like
women who will gaze in crystals or shuffle
cards for half a crown. Also, there are
the racing tipsters always ready to mention
the names of “certs.” But these are all
hole-and-corner prophets, and there is a
distinct lack of the larger, hairier person
who once warned nations and threatened
doom with a w.ave of his hallowed whiskers.
The universal Biel Smith, confident and
careless in Berlin and Constantinople as in
Sydney, has no use for the prophet, does
not believe in him, and scouts the idea that
anybody- can make a better guess about the
future than his own approximation based on
the leading articles in the daily papers and
the argument in the second-class smoker of
the suburban train. But therein Bill
Smith shows himself to be a fool; for there
is no good reason why prophecy should not
be an exact soignee, and no good ground on
which the work of the expert in forecasting,
events should be scouted. Geology works
from no surer data than that on which the
trained prophet could build his foreknow-
ledge. Biology merely generalises from an
accumulation of known facts. Astronomy
comes nearer to the borderline of guesswork,
for all its elaborate mathematical calcula-
tions. than the true prophet need ever go.
As long as effect follows cause and the
causes can be carefully observed, human
barometers should be read as easily as those
frpm which the expert meteorologist com-
niles his report of the weather; and the
interplay of high and low pressures pro-
duces just as definite results in the field of
man as in the fields of wheat and lucerne.
Suppose there had been a properly estab-
lished Bureau of Prophecy in Germany, in
the hands of thoroughly qualified experts,
the results of the war row raging in Europe
world have been foretold to a nicety. The
hold which German trade had gained in
England, Belgium and throughout the
world would have been set down to a frac-
tion ; the innate barbarity of German troops
when let loose in broken cities would have
been carefully estimated; a balance would
have been struck between the effect of a
Krttpp shell on the Yorkshire coast and a
British order for aniline dyes; the staying
power of England and Russia would have
been worked out as an astronomer calcu-
lates the distance of a fixed star; and then,
when the material on hand was sufficient, a
series of charts would have been printed
showing the condition of a miner of West-
phalia, a merchant of Hamburg, a wood-
cutter of Saxony and a prince of Potsdam
after five more years of peace and after five
years of war. Under the influence of
those charts Germany would have remained
as calm as the nestling seeds of a pickled
cucumber, and as peaceful as the youngest
sausage in Munich. A similar Bureau of
Prophecy in England would have revealed
the exact position at the beginning of the
present controversy. It would then have
been known, as surely as that two and seven
make nine, that 100,000 of the best soldiers
could not vanquish 500,000 of the next
best; that British protection for Belgians
was a myth; and that, however certain
Britain might be to win out in the end, she
could not keep her treaty pledges faithfully
without organising her manhood on a scale
sufficiently large to meet all her obligations.
Of course, a Bureau of Prophecy might make
mistakes: but with sufficient data to work
from, its prognostications would become
more and more valuable as time went on,
and less and less would be left to the states-
man’s crude guess. There would be all the
difference between a scientific forecast of the
national position and the present haphazard
newspaper or magazine review of the situa-
tion that there is between the opinion of the
’longshoreman on to-morrow’s weather and
the work of the meteorological expert with
the barometer and wind reports before him.
There is, however, a great and funda-
mental difference between weather prognos-
tication and the forecast in the field of
human endeavor. Until such a country as
Australia can afford a glass roof, or until
aur electricians give us the control of air
currents and wind pressures which they
have promised us in the near future, there
is something fixed and absolute about the
rainfall and the windblow which we can do
little to alter or divert. In the case of man
or the nation of men it is different. The
Bureau of Prophecy could give us from its
collected data the detailed results which
would follow from one or a multitude of
causes, but the causes themselves would be
to a large extent alterable at will. We know
in a general way that a borrowing policy on
the part of a State or nation leads ft> dis-
aster. The Bureau of Prophecy would show
us exactly what would happen to indivi-
duals if such a policy were persisted in; but
there would be nothing at all to prevent
Governments from going in for sound
finance, ceasing to borrow, and establishing
large sinking funds for the repayment of ex-
isting loans. Again, the man in the felt hat
has a hazy and general notion about the
effects of a certain fiscal policy. The Bureau
of Prophecy would formulate those effects,
and also the effects of art alternative system,
and only plain madness on the part of a
majority of the people could cause the nation
to persist in taking the wrong road. The
marvel is that prophecy as a reputable
branch of science has not secured recognition
long ago. The statesman, from the very
nature of his job, cannot undertake a scien-
tific forecast of the future. He has become
so much a special pleader along certain lines
that as a logician he falls lamentably short.
It is not the, administrator, the leader a.nd
manager of men, who must read line by line-
and point by point the signs of the times.
His business is to act honestly and faithfully
upon the information that is put before him ;
but the real work must be done by the clear,
logical man of induction, the trained scien-
tist to whom the world is a laboratory and
the events of history chemical reactions. The
statesman may not know and may not care
what will be the result of mixing large im-
ports and big borrowing with aggravated
Trade Unionism ; but the man of science,
with his collected data before him would fur-
nish a report showing to a soup-kitchen the
tabulated result. The statesman, under pre-
sent conditions, may plunge into war with
an inflated notion of his nation’s prowess
and a reckless disregard of consequences;
but he would never dare to do so while there
was a Bureau of Prophecy to furnish the
casualty lists beforehand and indicate the
exact measure of loss entailed. At present,
the statesman is a blind leader of the blind;
with a well-organised Bureau of Prophecy
he would work with full light and knowledge
and set his feet in sure places.
Of all • countries Australia needs the
Bureau of Prophecy most. Nowhere is there
a nation with larger opportunities, because
nowhere is there a nation which owns a
whole continent, and nbwhere do the politi-
cal leaders show a poorer grasp of oppor-
tunities. This is partly due to the magni-
tude of their task. Men accustomed to the
work of the shire or one-horse municipality
naturally find it difficult to think in terms
of nations ; and men whose views were for-
merly bounded by the artificial borders of
narrow %nd jealous States find it hard to
,think in terms of a united continent. They
mean well, some of them, and some have
seen big visions-; but too much light is as
frequent a cause of political blindness as
any, and the Amry knowledge of the size of
their job may keep-men wondering where to
begin. All this the Bureau of Prophecy
would .soon alter. Set it to work out the
result of leaving the Northern' Territory in its
present isolation, and it would supply a pic-
ture which would make Australians enthu-
siastic about blowing the place off the map
with the strongest explosive known. Give it
the problem of detailing the result of linking
up the railway from Oodnadatta to Pine
Greek, and there is no statesman worthy of
the name but would on receiving the report
jump for his hat and upset his inkstand in
his eaaerness to see the first rails laid. Ask
the trained prophets to give a detailed descrip-
tion of Australia’s future dust-heap capital
at Canberra, and the frilly of trying to wash
a livfi city in the Cotter’s trickle would be
patent to even an imported architect from
Chicago. One thing is certain. When the
scientific experts got to work plain common-
sense would have its full vindication. As
things are now, the politician may deny that
dust is dry or that the shortest way is the
least long, or that to pay a black man to do
Australia’s work is the same thing as taking
the woi’K away from a white Australian, or
that borrowed money when it circulates in
the country is money that the country has
not earned ; but the Bureau of Prophecy in
publishing its reports would make no sort
of mistaKe about these things.
A WAR MARCH.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Oscar Straus, the well-known Austrian composer,
has been commissioned, by the Kaiser to write anew
imperial march inspired by the war. It is to begin
with a funeral nore, and to end with one of triumph.
Straus has been promised the Order of the Ked Eagle
on completion of the work. — Cable.
Ow ! Wow! Wow!
(Funeral note, sustained by flutes, suggest-
ing a long-bodied, short-legged, large-headed
dog in anguish.)
Ow! WoW!
We are the people that make the row ;
We are the nation that skites and brags ;
Marching the goose-step ; waving the flags.
Hoch!
We talk too much, and we lose our block,
We scheme and spy; we plot, we lie
To blow the whole world into the sky.
The Kaiser spouts, and the Junkers rave.
Iloch ! for the Superman, strong and brave !
But what is the use of a Superman,
With “frightfulness” for his darbng plan,
If he has no cities to burn and loot,
No women to ravish, no babies to shoot?
Shall treaties bind us against our wish?
Kip! Swish !
( Violins: Tearing noise as of scraps of paper
being destroyed.)
Now at last shall the whole world learn
Of the cult of the Teuton, strong and stern!
Ho! for the Superman running amok!
Hoch!
Um —ta, um—ta, tiddeley—um—turn !
(Uncertain note, as of a German band that
has been told to move on.)
Pompety—pom pom —tiddeley—um—turn !
Way for the “blond beasts!” Here they
come!
While big guns thunder the nations’ doom.
Boom!
Room! Room !
Room for the German! A place in the sun !
He’ll play the Devil now he’s begun!
Iver-r-r-rump !.... Bump ! . .
(Drums: Noise of an exploding cathedral.)
Ho, the gaping wound and the bleeding
stump!
Watch the litle ones how they jump!
While we shoot and stab, and plunder and
grab,
Spurred by a Kaiser’s arrogant gab;
While the Glorious Junker
Grows drunker,
And drunker, on blood.
Blood ! Blood!
Sword or cannon or fire or flood,
Never shall stay our conquering feet —-
On through city and village street —
Feet that savagely, madly tread,
Over the living; over the dead.
Shoot! Shoot!
Burn and pillage and slay and loot!
To the sound of our guns shall the whole
world rock!
Hoch !
* * * *
Shrieks !
( Flutes, piccolos and trombones render, re-
spectively, the cries of children, shrieks of
women and groans of tortured non-com-
batants. Violins wail mournfully.)
Shrieks! Shrieks!
Hoch der Kaiser ! The whole land reeks
With tales of torture and savage rape,
Of fiends and satyrs in human shape ;
Fat hands grabbing where white flesh
shrinks;
And murdered age to the red earth sinks.
Kill! Kill!
Now at length shall we gorge our fill,
And all shall bow to the German will!
By the maids we ravish our lust to slake,
By the smoking ruins that mark our wake,
By the blood we spill, and the hearths we
blast....
This is The Day ! The Day at last!. ...
Praise to God ! On our bended knees,
We render thanks for boons like these.
For God and the Kaiser our cohorts flock!
Hoch!
(Scrap of German hymn-tune interpolated
here. )
Ach ! Donnerwetter! Himmel! Ach !
(Medley of indescribable noises rendered by
full orchestra, symbolic, partly of a German
band that is being severely kicked by an
irate householder, and partly of innumerable
blutwursts suddenly arrested in mid-career.)
Ach ! Ach !
“Dot vos not fair to shoot in der back !”
Who is this that has dared to face
Our hosts unconquered, and. pace by pace,
Presses us backward, and ever back, >
Over the blasted, desolate track?
What of the plans we planned so well?
We looked for victory—-this is Hell!
Hold ! Hold !
Mark the hearts of our comrades bold;
Look on the corpses of Culture’s sons—
Martyrs slain by a savage’s guns.
Respite now, in this feast of death !
Time ! An armistice ! Give us breath !
Nay? Then we cry to the whole world wide,
Shame on our foe for a plea denied !
Savages ! Brutes ! Barbarians all!
Here shall we fight with our backs to the
wall!
Boom ! Boom ! Boom !
("Ten more thousands gone to their doom.)
Boom!
(Bass drums only, for 619,358 bars, symbol-
ising a prolonged artillery war. Into this
there breaks suddenly the frenied howl of the
long-bodied, short-legged, large-headed dog
already m entioned.)
Hate! Hate! Hate! Hate!
We spit on the British here at our gate!
Foe of humanity! Curst of the world !
On him alone let our hate be hurled!
For his smiling sneers at the Junkers’ creed,
For his cold rebuke to a Kaiser’s greed;
For his calm disdain of our noble race,
We fling our spite in his scornful face.
Under the sea and high in the air,
Death shall seek for him everywhere ;
The lurking death in the submarine,
The swooping death in the air machine.
Alone of them all he has sealed our fate!
Hate! Hate! Hate!
(Prolonged discord, followed by deep, mys-
terious silence—imposed by Censor—for 793
bars. )
Bang!
(Deep staccato note as of a bursting blut-
wurst.)
Ow! Wow! Woof!
(Dying howl of a stricken hound. Silence
again for an indefinite number of bars. Then,
in countless bars, saloons, tea-shops, coffee-
houses, cafes and restaurants throughout the
British Empire and most of Europe, a sud-
den, loud, triumphant chorus, toned by a note
of relief, and dominated by “The Marseil-
laise” and “ Tipperary .” A somewhat uncer-
tain but distinctly nasal cheer is heard from
the direction of New York.)
Peace! Peace !
At last the sounds of the big guns cease;
At last the beast is chased to his lair,
And we breathe again of the good, clean air.
The gates have fallen ! The Allies win!
And the hoys are marching about Berlin!
The Kaiser’s down ; and the story goes
A British Tommy has pulled his nose.
The German eagle has got the nip;
Vive les Allies !... Hooroo !. .. Hip ! Hip !. ..

PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Shameless Mendicants.
Several subjects have been listed for the
forthcoming Premiers’ Conference. Among
them are the uniform gauge, the
transfer of industrial arbitration, etc.,
to the Commonwealth, and reciprocity
in respect to workmen’s compensation. But
though these are paraded in the newspapers,
only one subject will receive really serious
attention —the old, familiar lOU. The sole
point of interest just now to the Premiers
is how soon they can jointly and severally
get to the side door of the mont-de-piete.
Prom what Prime Minister Fisher had to
say during last week, it seems that howls
of'woe from the States drift in at his window
every hour of the day and wake him up at
night. Though it was seen that John Bull
and his friends were likely to require as
much money as they could put hands on
for purposes of war, the Commonwealth, to
oblige the States, succeeded in cadging about
eighteen millions, on the scandalously false
pretence that it was needed for defence pur-
poses ; but with the loan came an intimation
that, in the present great crisis, further
borrowing by the States would be looked
upon with the utmost disfavor. The States,
having grabbed the cash, went gaily on with
the old, disreputable drunk, and positively
refused to sober up. Having “blewed” most
of the proceeds of that transaction and made
thoroughly reliable arrangements for speedily
getting rid of the remainder, they are
now yelling to Fisher an entreaty to turn
it on again. Money “must be got at any
cost,” and the clamor on Fisher’s doorstep
grows more insistent each week. Therefore
next month’s conference will be spent in
furtively scheming out methods, or means,
or excuses, or manufacturing plain unani-
mous lies, for putting a tattered old mendi-
cant outside the London Stock Exchange,
arming the object with a large, cavernous
alms box, and labelling the outfit “Aus-
tralia.” The shame of this is not to be
lightly thought of. The pretence that Gov-
ernments entered one after another upon
their wild-cat borrowing in order that “the
wealth of the community might be in-
creased by developing our great resources”
can no longer be advanced, except by poli-
tical magsmen. If the allegation had con-
tained even the husks of truth, how comes it
that Australia cannot live now on the “in-
creased wealth” created by an avalanche of
loans, or stand up on two self-respecting feet
in the hour of the nation’s trial? The truth
is that all this borrowing and squandering
has merely added to the annual tri-
bute wrung from the people by the foreign
money-lender and by hordes of local sharks
and landlords who fatten in the atmosphere
of boom. By loans, more loans and further
loans the citizens of the several States have
been drugged into a condition of fiscal in-
sensibility, and politicians have thus found
it easy to evade the most essential of their
obligations. And in order that an additional
supply of the anesthetic may be on hand,
the Premiers will next month retire into
some convenient hole or corner and decide
on the manner of their further abasement.

The Braggart of the Western World.
The German is a wondrous visionary.
Objects attainable by anything short of wiz-
ardry don’t interest him. Examine xis
record in this war. The boast that he wayi
to sweep the fleets of Britain from the seas
and eat his Christmas meal at the Elysee is
already forgotten —forgotten even by the
childish, Hans himself, who has been chasing
all sorts of other butterflies since those days.
At the present moment hejs after the love
and affection of the people of Belgium. He
informs his involuntary hosts that he can’t
understand “how England can have the
heart” to bombard Ostend and Zeebrugge,
and adds that he will remain and defend the
country while one brick remains upon
another. In the autumn he told the world
that the November fogs would be availed of
for destroying London with Zeppelins, and
his best jurisprudents were ordered to de-
liver formal judgments—which they did—to
the effect that “the destruction of London is
permissible.” Nothing happened in Novem-
ber. In December an impatient Yankee jour-
nalist got an interview out of Admiral von
Ttrpitz. The Yankee asked if there was any
truth in the report that an invasion of
England by Zeppelins was in preparation. Tir-
pitz replied: “I think a submarine war

against British merchant shipping would be
still more effective/’ This remark accident-
ally gave away the true German opinion of
the value of Zeppelins, and a little later
Hans formally announced that he was about
to “encircle England, torpedoing every
British ship, every ship belonging to
the allies that approached any British
port, and thereby cut off the greater
part of England’s food supply.” This
rotund pronunciamento bore firstfruits
on January 21, when the Durward, a small
coasting tramp, was sunk. Up to date about
a dozen ships of the sort —half of them neu-
trals—have gone down, and four of Hans’s
submarines have gone with them. Mean-
while this dauntless optimist had announced
his intention of assuming the Caliphate—dhe
Papacy of Islam. The only result was that
millions of Mahommedans clamored for the
privilege of fighting under Britain’s stan-
dards. Under his “kolossal” assertions
of what he was about to undertake
in relation to Egypt, the Egyptians were be-
coming doubtful of British power and even
restive. As though to remove this doubt he
ordered an attack on the Suez Canal. The
attempt was made, and it resulted in a loss
to the enemy of 4000 in battle and of Heaven
knows how many more bv thirst and hunger
in the desert. To the Egyptian, who rea-
sons no farther than he sees, it has done
much for Britain’s prestige, while it lias
reduced Germany to the proportions of a
military joke. So wild and numerous are
Hans’s prophecies that it is hard for non-
Teutonic minds to follow them. The one
thing clear is that they are invariably falsi-
fied. Some months ago he announced
through his Emperor that he would arm
every woman, cat and dog before he would
yield an inch of German or Austrian terri-
tory. To-day his women are reported to
be rioting in his own potato-markets, and
he is trying to persuade so minor a Power
as Italy to accept presents of Austrian terri-
tory in a lamentable attempt to buy friend-
ship with somebody else’s money. His flair
for the Avrong thing is infallible, and his
capacity for doing it with the maximum of
publicitv is matchless. He was going to
vet “a place in the sun,” and was pushed out
by the Japanese. He was going to “bestow
Freedom on South Africa,” and was attacked
by the Boers. He was going to bombard
England from Calais, and he can’t even reach
Calais. He was going to terrify everybody
and he has frightened nobody. If he only
prophesied a. hundred per cent, less he might
be as much as 10 per cent, more effective.
—♦ —
The Ever-open Door.
Of course no Power could come along and
swallow Australia at one gulp. The country
is too large a mouthful for even a llohen-
zollern or any other swollen potentate.
But though CUesar didn’t swallow England
when his centurions waded ashore in 55 8.C.,
yet the Roman put up a bungalow for him-
self and remained in it for 400
years. Nor had the Pilgrim Fathers 'in
America anything more to begin with than
a place to fall on their knees. Various
people—Romans in Britain, Moors in Spain,
British in India, Spanish in Mexico, and
many others —have extended themselves
gradually from some point they managed to
seize upon, and from which the other fellow
couldn’t or didn’t throw them out. It is
true the Romans are no longer in Britain,
that the Moors were chased from Spain, that
Mexico has ceased to find tribute for Mad-
rid ; but none of these circumstances has
the least interest for the peoples who in
life had the heel on their necks. Austra-
lians of to-day can hardly be expected to
rejoice over the idea that, if a foreign
enemy established an address somewhere
within the continent, he would have nothing
to look forward to in the course of a few
centuries but ejectment. The Turk has been
squatting down in Europe for a long time
now, and hasn’t been evicted even yet. What
we in this country don’t want is to let the
camel get his head in the tent. And the
trouble is that it is gaping such an invita-
tion to him. Perhaps no single country
since man got down off .the trees has ever
presented such an expansive invitation. Yet
if it be asked what Australian statesmen
are doing to bar the door, the answer can
only be —nothing! What the nation wants
and has undertaken to provide is a railway
running straight north and south, establish-
ing the indispensable preliminary of settle-
ment, commerce and defence. But peddling
incompetence is surreptitiously trying to
huddle this pressing need out of sight, so
that a great, fertile but empty and remote
part of Australia may still remain naked
and more easily accessible to an enemy than
to ourselves.
The Blighting Influence of Big Estates.
These barrackers for cheap labor (prefer-
ably colored) are a hardy lot. One John
F. Palmer, for several years manager of the
experiment farm at Daly River, having nosed
out a nice little section 4000 miles in area,
came south lately with a varied tale. Part
of it was that tropical products are being
grown in the Northern Territory with en-
couraging results; that in the Daly district
the soil is 30ft. deep; that the climate has
no terrors; and that the whole country is
“the finest on earth.” All this was highly
satisfactory; but having told an interviewer
about the fertility and general desirability of
the Australian garden of which he has appro-
priated such a fine, large slice, our John F.
Palmer proceeded to insist upon the need
for bringing in “hundreds of thousands” of
Javanese coolies. So the latest contribution
to the subject is this: That a land capable
of great production, and desirable as a place
of residence for whites, ought to be turned
into a spot for sustaining myriads of semi-
slavds (Mr. Palmer stipulates for 10 years’
indentures), instead of a place where the
labor and enterprise of Australians might
find reward. Yet John F. Palmer is a
bird of quite familiar plumage. Let any
man in the Northern Territory, in Victoria —
anywhere in the world- —get his paw on a
huge piece of the earth’s surface, then for
the remainder of his life he will regard the
rest of the human family, white, black and
brown, as so many serfs, whose Gop-ordained
function it is to till his soil, dig his ditches,
build ais fences and gather for him the fruits
of the. earth. ,Of all classes of men none are
more intolerant, greedy and unpatriotic than
the big landowner- —none who treat labor
more scurvily. The passion of these men
for domination is invariably in direct rela-
tion to the size of their holdings, and extends
not only' to the appropriation of the soil,
but to the expropriation of those people who
dare challenge the landlords’ right to
dominion over their cringing servitor’s body
and soul.

Party Above All.
The disreputable feature of the N. S. Wales
Liquor Act, whereby during certain hours
on Good Friday and Christmas Day grog
may be purchased in the hotels but not con-
sumed therein, appears likely to continue
for some time, although the farcical system
leads to degrading exhibitions in the streets
and clamors for abolition. During the
specified hours on the days mentioned,
bottles and kegs are purchased all over the
city and suburbs, and parties of men and
youths (and occasionally women) sit on
the kerbstones lapping up the liquor as
long as it lasts, or, if there is sufficient cash
available, as long as the tipplers can suck at
a demi-john or the neck of a bottle. Pro-
test after protest has been made, not only
from wowsers, but from tolerant and broad-
minded citizens. The better-class publican
himself declines to be • a party to the in-
iquity. But there is a lion in the path of
reform, as blue-ribboner David Hall,
Attorney-General, lias discovered. A few
days ago Hall was waited upon by a depu-
tation which requested him to take his
sling and slay Goliath. But not this
David ! He looked a starter for a moment;
then, like his model, Holman, he found
a war on his hands and a political truce and
all the usual lumber that has made his party
a delusion and a snare. Some time ago, he
admitted, he had promised to amend the
Act, but “owing to the war and the exist-
ence of the political truce he had had no
opportunity of giving effect to this promise,
nor would he be able to carry it out during
the coming session, which was to be devoted
to giving effect to special planks of the
Labor platform.” (Loud and continued
laughter.) What Hall didn’t tell the depu-
, tation is that if he sought to amend the
Liquor Act in the direction of deleting a
nuisance and a public scandal, other amend-
ments would be howled for by influential
factions on the Good Templars’ and Good
Tipplers’ sides. And that would be awk-
ward for the Party. So, rather than have
things awkward for the great joss Party, a
nuisance and a public scandal must remain.
•
The Spirit of the Cow.
At the Kiama (N.S.W.) Show the other
day, the Minister for Agriculture took an
unprecedented step. He said that the dis-
trict was stagnant. Cow-tarmers in the
prime of life weakened at the knees with
amazement, and the oldest inhabitant said
in a scandalised manner that he had never
heard the like, and that the Minister must
be a pro-Boer. Asheord bowed before the
blast, and made something of a recanta-
tion. He hastened to point out that he had
erred —the local coal and blue-metal develop-
ment had been most satisfactory of recent
years. This had no bearing on the original
charge—no more than if he had accused the
Kiama police of being opium fiends, and
then qualified his remarks by pointing out
that they were good to their mothers —but
it satisfied the Illawarra natives. It is
hard to understand why a public man should
have backed down in any respect on this
question. Illawarra is stagnant, and, till
the inhabitants realise it, must remain so.
The district is in the midst of one of the
finest seasons on record. Long grass,
abundant water and fat stock are every-
where. And with them may be noted
tumble-down homesteads, unkempt gardens,
ruined orchards, vegetable plots that haven’t
been tended for months, and fencing in the
last stages of decay. If a farmer has a silo,
which is seldom, it is most likely to be
empty. Wherever one looks .one finds him
relying on Providence, the weather
and the fertility of the soil. The
industries which the Minister for Agri-
culture particularised as a qredit to
this part of the country, are run on very dif-
ferent lines. The smelting and metal-refin-
ing works at Port Ivembla followed on huge
Government expenditure, and their value has
been realised by the application of tireless
energy, guided by the most modern scientific
methods. The same applies to the coal-get-
ting business. If either of them had been
run for any length of time on local dairy-
farming lines, they would be insolvent. To
say that the average Illawarra cow-raiser
applies science to his operations is to voice
a pathetic absurdity. Methods that were in
vogue a generation ago are still followed on
many farms. The milking-bail surroundings
of an age before Socialism was heard of
prevail in certain cases—surroundings where
milking cows, which may or may not be
perfectly healthy, are driven into unspeak-
able filth to await their turn at the disease-
dispenser. Things would be worse but for
the vigilance of the Board of Health. And
even that doesn’t constitute an effective check,
as was evidenced recently when some of the
best-known farmers in Southern Illawarra
were convicted and heavily fined. It is a
notorious truth that the dairy farmer in
Illawarra, as elsewhere in N. S. Wales to a
greater or less degree, needs stirring up.
There is something about his trade, seem-
ingly, which induces the feeling that it is
always afternoon and that nothing matters.
It may be that his attitude towards life is
influenced unconsciously by the posture which
he is required to take up twice daily upon
the milking-stool. It may be again that the
spirit of the Cow enters into his soul after
a while and dazes him. Anyhow, he remains
one of the most casual, easy-going and unpro-
gressive producers that Australia possesses.
It is a deplorable thing that on the only occa-
sion when one in authority summons up the
nerve to disclose to him exactly how the rest
of the community regards him, there should
immediately follow recantations and apolo-
gies and the soft word which disparages hard
work.
An Example in Town Planning.
Somebody lately whispered to Melbourne’s
Housing Commission that if it wanted to
investigate real slum conditions it should,
having finished with the Asiatic quarter,
get away from Collingwood and Port Mel-
bourne and poke an inquisitive nose into
the beach frontages, where the week-enders
and campers-out dwell. Seeing that there
is room on the bayside for half a dozen
Melbournes, the Commission was sceptical,
but it went—and came away convinced. It
learnt that the earlier bayside residents, of
half a dozen years ago, built themselves
healthy, airy homes on commodious blocks
among the ti-tree, a little back from the
water. Then the land speculator came and
perceived that the wicket was excellent. He
promptly acquired the remaining soil,
especially, that lying right on the water-line,
and subdivided it. Also he re-subdivided it
and then subdivided the subdivisions. Fur-
ther, he grabbed right-of-ways, tracks and
unmade streets and subdivided them. Then
he sold at a great profit. So the Commis-
sion found that in these quite modern,
spacious health resorts there were patches
of slum as bad as any in the metropolis.
At Chelsea, on a block 40ft. by 120, are
four . shanties, housing four good-sized
families. All around are dwellings having
less open spaces and playing areas than are
fashionable at Fitzroy. The bay is there
and the narrow strip of unclean sand, but
the only access thereto for these people is
by a six-feet right-of-way several hundred
yards distant. A little further along the
foreshore the land jobber reached the
supreme limit in closer settlement. On a
block 180 ft. by 50ft, facing a 12ft. lane, ar''
10 bungalows, holding between 40 and 50
people, and. nicely distributed between these
and in alignment and facing the lane are
three privies. The reckless extravagance of
thus wasting three square yards of land!
These are but instances; other more re-
cently-acquired holdings, from Mordialloc,
through Aspendale and Chelsea, right down
past Carrum, are on the same lines, with
little provision for sanitation and less for
decency. It is only a question of time, and
an epidemic will sweep the district like the
bushfire swept it last year. Asked why it
hadn’t supervised these “settlement” pro-
ceedings, the municipal council responsible
—that of Ilandenong—said it had “no
power”; which was a lie, inasmuch as under
the I ~oal Government and Health Acts
both Brunswick and Footscray have lately
restrained the land-jobber from these slum-
creating schemes. The simple fact is the
Handenong Council was too tired or too
Tory or too “interested” to interfere, and
it has thus spoilt what might have been an
ideal health resort for Melbourne’s less
wealthy citizens.

A Use for Sydney’s Prize White Whale.
“Mary McC.” has an idea:—
The aldermen of Sydney have decided that, as the
Victoria Markets are not a paying concern at pre-
sent, they must be allowed to lose money until the
war is over. It is easy to say that the place is un-
suitable for the purpose for which it was built; but
has that ever been tested? Suppose the Gaud Mayor
and his councillors were to make a sincere attempt
to use the place as a means of bringing producer and
consumer directly together, by fitting up the building
with stalls which would be let for one or two days at
a moderate price. There are thousands of people in
the State with occasional lines of goods to sell who
would be glad to have the chance to secure a central
place to dispose of them by direct sale to the buying
public, but who could not maintain a shop or stall
for more than a few days in the year. Thus an
orchardist at Ryde would be glad to offer a fine lot
of oranges for one day’s quick sale without the neces-
sity of passing his goods through the fingers of a
middleman. The next day, or the same day, the lady
who knits socks or carves out baby linen might have
a stall and dispose of a large portion of the results
of 12 months’ work in eight good selling hours.
On a third day a black-and-white artist could offer
all his rejected drawings at bargain prices that
would defy competition. The effect would be an ever
changing bazaar full of surprises at which things
good and cheap would be always purchasable, and the
central position of the markets would soon make them
the most popular place of profitable entertainment in
the city. The shouting of wares could be prohibited,
and certain classes of goods, like old clothes and tin
brooches, rigidly excluded. Many a man now out of
employment would get busy in his own back-yard if
he had a place in which to dispose of the results of
his toil. Instead of waiting till the war is over or
the millennium is proclaimed, it is up to the city
to help itself by helping this man to meet the people
who would buy his wares at the low price at which
by direct trade he could afford to sell them.

John Scadpan, of Westralia, is in a tight
place. In the last four years his Govern-
ment has spent £1,180,000 beyond its income,
and the loan expenditure has averaged about
three millions per annum. As a result of the
splash, “Happy Jack” and his Ministers
have been able to maintain their popularity
with _ the people who put them in, and by
starting State steamers and butcheries and
brickyards and implement works and
quarries and timber mills, and by construct-
ing all public works by day labor, they have
been able to buy many new friends. This might
have gone on for longer even than it takes
to get to Tipperary, had not the war upset
their barrow. Now, unless some miracle-
worker shows them the way to raise the
wind. State expenditure will have to be cut
down by £3,000,000 per annum. Yet, instead
of shortening sail, Scappan is for the
moment piling on more, and trusting to some-
thing—he hasn’t the ghost of an idea what—
to save the situation. This “Happy Jack”
business can be overdone. It is all very well
when Jack pays for his own joy drink ; but
when he charges the spree up to the youngster
“happy” isn’t the adjective to meet the
case. In fact, there isn’t any adjective that
quite meets the case. To merely throw a
part of speech at a public danger like this
is a gross misuse of grammar.
.
The N.. S. Wales Taxation Commissioners
demand income tax on the reversionary value
of life-insurance bonuses; and there is an
outcry against it, as there ought to be,
because the reversionary value may be three
times more than the present or cash value.
A man’s expectation of life may be 30 years,
and the reversionary value in that case is the
value of the bonus 30 years hence, after it
has been “improved” by compound interest
throughout that period. It is so manifestly
unjust to charge a man tax on income 30
years before it is earned that the Commis-
sioners must retreat from that position if
they want to be regarded as anything but
Shylocks. The collection of tax on the cash
value of bonuses is quite a different matter.
There is no good reason why this should be
regarded as sacrosanct. Certainly it is a
most commendable thing for a man to insure.
But it is also a very commendable thing for
a man to put money in the Savings Bank ; yet
if he does that, or makes any other invest-
ment for the benefit of his family, or to buy
pap for himself in his toothless old age,
nobody suggests that the interest or dividend
should not be taxable. Indeed, there is
one stronger reason for taxing insurance
profits than for collecting any portion of
other profits'; for the insurance profits or
earnings go to the hale, while other profits
or earnings often go to the weak or maimed.
Insurance offices won’t accept such people,
wherefore they have to make their old-age
and death provision elsewhere.
“Eddyson” : I fiercely resent the doctrine,
much preached of late, that war is essential
to keep alive in man his finest animal quali-
ties, daring, physical endurance, and the
power to suffer and be strong. The assump-
tion that with the passing of war these mag-
nificent attributes will desert mankind is
widely upheld by comfortable, beef-fed
gentry, whose patriotic duty it is to per-
suade other fellows to go and fight. Really
man’s daring, his physical endurance and
his contempt of pain are attributes he owes,
not to war, but to his daily work ; and while
men still have to fight the earth for the
fruits thereof, they will remain strong and
courageous and hard. Man is shaped by his
immediate conditions; it is the things touch-
ing him daily that chasten and mould and
make him, not the casual battles in which
he indulges. These battles are not the
originating influences, but the manifesta-
tions of his daring and bis might. Men
are made in the deep mines, out on the
riven seas, in the foundry and the factory,
subduing the wilds, mustering the cattle, and
bringing the big timber in, and when they
no longer haVe to do these things, courage
and special endurance will be of little use to
them, since the true value of hardihood is in
man’s work, not in his waste, which is war.
“Quidam,” on the old, decadent towns of
N. S. Wales:—
What is the blight that affects the country on the
western slopes ot the Blue Mountains? What con-
tinually surprises me is to see good land in a district
where real droughts are unknown, lying almost in a
state of nature, with a fence round it, a few sheen
on it, and a dilapidated residence somewhere or other
about it. One can’t walk down a valley or creek
without seeing plots, now desolate, where at one time
50 or 100 acres were cultivated, and families born
and brought up. Potatoes, apples, cherries, maize,
cats, anything almost will grow, yet little of the
country is used. The ideal appears to be to own
enough to support enough sheep to just live on, and
to leave the bulk of the land as it was when Cook
struck Australia-—worse, in fact, for it was not in-
fested with briars, rabbits and thistles then. There
are many districts which should support thousands
and have tens; for the land, which in Victoria would
be worth £2O or £3O an acre for agricultural pur-
poses, is utilised only for pastoral pursuits, and very
poor pursuits at that. If the owner of 1000 acres,
say, has the house his grandfather built out of mud,
a good horse to ride, about four acres under crop
every year, and a laborer’s billet now and then
somewhere in the district, he seems quite content.
There is land enough, and of high enough quality, in
some of these regions to support towns like Mary-
borough, St. Arnaud, Stawell, Horsham and Warrack-
nabeal in Victoria ; yet rabbits and a few sheep are
the principal products. Somebody wants hanging,
but who is it?
The Australian correspondent of the Lon-
don Times recently favored that respectable
journal with a communication having refer-
ence to the attitude of Australia towards
the war. The best that can be said of it is
that it would probably be found most com-
forting at Berlin. The essence of it.
was that the Australian people “merely
feel they are helping a friend out of
a hole,” and are “not striving every
nerve in conjunction with' their partners”;
that “though their leaders know the truth”
the community is slow to learn; that (and
here the writer seems to have soaked his
claims to sanity in petrol and set them
alight) “one [himself, obviously] is tempted
to wish” that German cruisers had shelled
Melbourne and Sydney. On the next occa-
sion this amazing individual writes about
the atitude of Australia, he might indi-
cate the name and address of the
people who, being removed 10.000 miles from
the scene of any war, did more, or tried to
do more, than the citizens of the Common-
wealth have done since August of last year.
He might also explain what more could have
been done in the way of training and equip-
ping men for service, and what greater ser-
vice could have been rendered by Australia
to the Empire than is represented by (1)
the immediate seizure of all German posses-
sions in the Pacific; (2) the destruction of
the cruiser Emden ; (3) the transport of the
well-organised force now in Egypt; (4) the
training and equipment of the forces now
being brought into line; and (5) the pro-
tection of British shipping, financial and
commercial interests on Australian waters
and Australian soil. Having done all that,
he might perhaps be good enough to make
it clear to London stockjobbers that when
German cruisers dropned shells into Scar-
borough and Yarmouth, there were at any
rate no Australians who felt “tempted to
wish” that the dose mirht be repeated on a
few other English villages. That more
nursemaids might be murdered is a pious
wish which the Commonwealth will permit
this extraordinary brand of Times corres-
pondent to wear as a badge all his own.

The Turk has suddenly hit back —hard.
The blow happened to fall on a point where
the Allies could best afford to take it, but
the joy in the harem has no doubt been great
and the salutations to Allah exceedingly
plentiful. To sink three warships in an
hour or two, and cripple another, was a
fairly good performance, anyhow, even though
the consequence must be to bring a heavier
weight of devastation to bear on the remain-
ing fortifications of the Dardanelles. If it
be true that the local Pasha has
been answering back with 14in. shells,
the final push through the door will be
an even more furious matter than had been
generally expected. Apparently a scheme of
taking the Turk by the slack of his pants as
well as by the throat is now being put into
operation, for veiled references are made to
an expeditionary force being landed in the
vicinity of the disturbance, and these troops
are not likely to have been brought on the
scene to brandish olive branches before the
disreputable enemy. In the main battle-
fields, work during the past week has pro-
ceeded along now-familiar lines. Little
change is reported. The Russian has again
put a heavy paw on eastern Prussia, and has
captured Przemysl; and the Hun in return
promises to burn more Russian villages as
soon as he gets a chance to live up to his
traditions. Prom Flanders there come tidings
of unusual mortality among British officers
at the battle of St. Eloi—a desperate
hand-to-hand struggle, in which the German
got an unpleasant taste of what’s coming to
him directly in larger doses. Meantime a
section of British workmen have again been
showing how close a relation to the hoof of
the mule the horny hand of the toiler may
be, by striking work at moments calcu-
lated to cause national embarrassment.
Kitchener has spoken to some of these
people in tones of polite menace; but unless
they mend their ways pretty quickly this affa-
bility of his is likely to wear off. All things
considered, the sooner the better.
South Aus. is investigating one of those
ugly murders that occasionally shock a quiet
up-country district. Old William Escott, a
grazier, widely popular and without a known
enemy, was shot dead through the window
as he sat reading in his lonely house near
the Burra. The murderer simply vanished
in the darkness; hut a gun has been re-
covered from a deep well not far away. It
is the kind of case in which Sensational
Developments may occur at any moment.
“Garboard Strake”: What men will do
for a crust was exemplified on March 19,
when three of them and 1000 bags of coke
set sail in the good ship Hornet from Port
Jackson to Botany Bay. To call the vessel
the “good ship Hornet” is poetic license.
To be exact the ark was an ancient steam
lighter usually employed in dodging about
Darling Harbor. When she rounded the
South Head into the gaping Pacific a fair
southerly swell was met, and before the
Hornet had buzzed along more than about
a mile she had opened out for’ard. The
crew of three hurriedly began presenting
the 1000 bags of coke to D. Jones, Esq., but
before long the liner started to sink. The
captain, taking off his shirt, waved it fran-
tically towards the South Head Signal Sta-
tion. Luckily, the lynx in charge saw the
fluttering garment and sent the Captain
Cook out to investigate. Just as the pilot
steamer dashed up the lighter sank, and one
of the three men on board went down with
her. The other two were picked out of the
slavering jaw;s of death.
“Jermyn Street” on Night Life: —
A cable comes through that the Home Office has
shut down on the London Night Clubs. A decade
ago it would have meant little. If you wanted
“night life” and good food you went to Paris. You
rot the food almost anywhere. For food, drink and
sauciness combined you resorted to one of the many
cabarets de nuit round about the Place Blanche or
the Place Pigalle. If you wanted an evening's
innocent amusement you went over to “the other
side” of the Seine to the Bal Bullier. If less in-
sistent upon innocence you went to the Bal Tabarin.
Beginning with the cooking, this life has gradually
been transferring itself to London. The cooking
there of late years has become the best in the
world, and the “night life” was rapidly becoming
so. Such clubs as Murray’s and the Four Hundred
were well ahead of anything that Paris ever knew.
The habit spread quickly. Clubs grew like lucerne
on the Hunter Flats. There were 150 of them in
Soho alone. Then the Savoy, the Carlton, Oddenino’s
and the other big supper places began to protest.
Simultaneously, black sheep began to appear. “A
Father”—who might have been a father, but was
also probably a restaurant proprietor—wrote to the
press saying that “many of these clubs are nothing
but vile traps for young officers who come to London
on leave from the Front.” It was also said that
many of them were gambling hells. There was
something in it, maybe, but not very much, as all
of them since August have been under nightly super-
vision by the Provost-Marshal. Their worst offence
was their exorbitant charges. However, the Daily
Mail wrote a leader about it, and that put the lid
on. The all-embracing Defence of the Realm Act
did the rest.

A new star —not named Muriel—blazed
suddenly in the Australian theatrical sky
on Monday at Sydney Criterion. The illness
of Muriel Starr gave to her understudy,
Sylvia Bremer, a young Australian girl, the
chance that comes, on the stage, only once
in a lifetime; and Sylvia Bremer seized
and held it. An understudy must neces-
sarily model her performance upon that of
her study; but within those limits she has
a certain opportunity for the expression of
her own individuality. Little of it is appa-
rent in Miss Bremer’s brilliant per-
formance of the heroine’s part in “Bought
and Paid For”: there are times when she
actually seems to be Muriel Starr. But she
has youth, beauty, a moving voice and an
appealing appearance; and none of Muriel
Starr’s parts could have fitted her so admir-
ably as the part of Virginia Blaine. With-
out comparing her work in the big, emo-
tional moments with that of Muriel Starr,
Miss Bremer brings out better than the
American actress the full horror of an in-
nocent wife terrorised by a drunken, uxori-
ous husband ; and even in the big moments
of this play Sylvia Bremer, though lacking
the power and thrill of Muriel Starr’s voice,
plays with either an unexpected strength
of her own, or, more probably, with a mas-
terly mimicry. Those who, hearing of Miss
Muriel Starr’s illness, are waiting for her
return, are advised first to see Sylvia
Bremer in the part. It is a performance,
for a girl so young, that is remarkable ; and
her future as an emotional actress will
depend solely upon herself.

The “Cinderella” pantomime, which
arrived at Her Majesty’s (Sydney) on Satur-
day, is the usual gorgeous irrelevancy. It is
beautifully produced, in the sense that the
stage is, for the most part, a dazzling mass
of color and electric light and girl; there
are lots of jokes, even if there isn’t much
humor; and the sentimental and patriotic
touches are duly introduced. Minnie Love

Girl respectively, are satisfactory, without
being staggering. Barry Lupino, who plays
Bill, a page-boy, seems to suffer from the
absence of make-up. But his dancing is as
remarkable as ever, and he does some ex-
cellent character-acting when the oppor-
tunity offers. Arthur Stigant is an
uproariously diverting Dame, and Jack
McArdle is a quiet but entirely, acceptable
Baron. And then there are Dollie Harmer;
and Gertie Latchford, whose skit on an
Early-Victorian music-hall girl is superb;
and Leslie Gaze, who forgets that he is in
pantomime and postures as a beauty actor;
and Maggie Dickenson, whose solo dancing
is beyond reproach; and, finally, giving
about the best turn in the show, a couple of
tiny children, who perform difficult acrobatic
feats with the languid ease of an inebriate
falling into a gutter. When this panto-
mime has had a few of its many superfluities
shorn off, it will be worth travelling from
a far suburb to see.

The Wirths’ elephants have come to town
again looking like a Fourth of July proces-
sion in new upholstery. After them walk the
lions and their whiskers, and the bears, like
amiable sofas on end, shuffle open-mouthed in
the midst of minor snorts, yelps and smells.
The official Prince Alfred Park programme
would probably contradict it, but this writer
has a hazy impression (the sole relic of
three crowded hours) that there are also
dinosaurs and scaly dragons, and those pecu-
liar and distracting female birds which scoot
through crowds uttering shrill cries of warn-
ing to the young flock scuttering behind. Or,
maybe, that is merely a nightmarish memory.
It is the ambition of all good circus proprie-
tors to bewilder and dazzle and have four
people with full-grown lions in their teeth
throwing themselves at one another in mid-
air, while a calm and preoccupied bear bal-
ances a lighted lamp and a brimming glass
of champagne on its nose, and does some
intricate fancy-work with its forepaws, re-
gardless of the fact that a tiger is standing
on his head in the corner and a wolf is tell-
ing lies to a lamb in the friendliest way down
in the sawdust. The Sydney child who wit-
nesses these things probably thinks that the
jungle is full of such proceedings. It is
no use trying to write in an orderly, col-
lected manner of a show full of gibbering
monkei's that goes at a gallop and turns

cubs looking out of its pockets. The Sydney

“CINDERELLA ” PANTO., AT HER
MAJESTY'S, SYDNEY.
Barry Lupino makes a good haul.
“A Royal Divorce” is the latest of Julius
Knight’s weekly resurrections at Sydney
Royal, and all the British bulldogs present
bark loudly when the stage Napoleon remarks
irritably, “These British bulldogs! they never
know when they are beaten!” We theatre-
goers are a grim, self-contained race; but,
when anything like that is said, we see at
once that it is no more than truth which
demands our applause. In Germany, of
course, dachshunds would be the invincibly
stupid animals. Julius himself, with one
hand fixed immovably in the breast of his
grey coat, and a heavy campaigner’s frown
on his powdered countenance, is the same
old perfectly-tailored parlor statuette which
has fired the humble imagination of stage
hands and supers, till they can almost see in
him a reincarnation of the Corsican. If
Julius liked to exploit his stage personality,
he could at any time gather a devoted and
quaintly-costumed Old Guard of 30 or so and
march on Bourke or any other of the great
inland capitals. He might even take Can-
berra, where rabbits frisk undisturbed
amongst the weatherbeaten foundation-stones
that a past G.-G. laid while O’Malley, the
boss-rposter, crowed. Irene Browne, as
the fearful Empress Josephine, is grace-
fully pettish, as if her new dress had
been countermanded and the dinner hadn’t
been quite a success. Dorothy Cumming
does creditably as Marie Louise; Lizette
Parkes is a radiant Stephanie; and Leslie
Victor (Talleyrand) is a neat, pocket-
edition plotter. On Saturday night, the
Royal’s theatrical merry-go-round will proba-
bly turn a little on its axis and exhibit
another aspect of itself.

“What Women Will Do For Love” is
Exhibit One at the Adelphi this week,
and many and marvellous are the
things that the authors —who are probably
young bachelors of 70 or so —have been led
to believe the gentler sex will do free of
charge. However, The Bulletin’s old
friend Billb, of Surry Hills, who was at
the gods’ entrance displaying a most per-
fect black eye, thought different. “Fat lot
they know erbout it! Look at that! Got
that fer askin’ th’ ol’ woman t’ chop th’
wood! Like ter see my ole girl carry on
like th’ tart on th’ stige just fer luv !” And
Billo was probably right. On Saturday
Brother Billanderson will descend upon the
scene with the panto. “Sinbad the Sailor,”
accompanied by Maggie Moore and Mrs.
Sinbad.

“Freddy” Shipman’s U.S.A. film of
Australia’s Annette Kellerman as “Nep-
tune’s Daughter” (a sort of fairy drama)
appears likely to return him a fair helping
of the currency. For the past few after-
noons and evenings the picture has been
exhibited at the Palace, and Annette, as
an old friend and a gladsome figure,
has received more welcome hand than has
resounded in the small theatre for a long
spell. One disappointment is that there_ is
not sufficient of Annette’s beautiful swim-
ming. If there were more of that and less
of the padding that surrounds her water
skill and body allurement the show would
be improved. Still it is a high-class photo-
play, with some beautiful settings, and
worth any man’s money and any girl’s envy.

Of two current art-union shows:—
There are two artists’ art-unions running in Syd-
ney—one whose entire proceeds go to the Red Cross
funds and one in which not less than 50 per cent,
is to he passed over. In the former case, the draw-
ings were the free gifts of the artists, tickets cost
from one to several guineas, and every ticket-holder
is to receive a prize. A number of people who made
gifts to this show considered that they could' arrange
another one at a more popular price. Thirty thousand
shilling tickets have accordingly been issued, and,
if they are all sold (as they are expected to be), they
will return £l5OO. Of this, £250 has been ear-
marked for expenses and £5OO will be taken by
the artists as their share of the value of the works
handed in. This will leave £750 for the Bed Cross.
There can be no complaint made about this, except-
ing that the public was not made fully aware of the
position, with the result that hard things have been
said and both efforts are likely to suffer. To'
make things quite plain, this, then, is the position in
a few words: there is one art union (tickets one
guinea) whose entire proceeds go to the Red Cross ;
there is another (tickets one shilling) whose promo-
ters have undertaken to hand over at least half the
proceeds. If you can afford a guinea, buy a ticket
in the first show, and the whole lot will benefit a Red
Cross. If you can afford only a shilling, buy a ticket
in the other show, and, while you have a run for
your money, you will know that at least sixpence
also goes to the Red Cross.

The air-tangoes of the Farokas are still

If St. Vincent’s Hospital (Sydney)
didn’t want the money worse than usual it
would cut out this year’s Easter-time amuse-
ment effort altogether. The call on its funds
has, however, been heavier even than usual
—it has, for instance, had a good many men
from Rabaul to nurse. So it must d<>
something; but instead of the usual ball it
will compromise and have a concert. The
Town Hall has been taken for Saturday.
April 10, for this event.

In the case of the Royal Strollers, who
came to Melbourne at the Auditorium last
Saturday, first impressions are the worst.
The co. improves on acquaintance, like unto
the local water supply, which issueth muddily
from the bath tap and becometli clear, bright
and even sparkling as it runneth on. The
explanation, no doubt, lies in the fact that
the Strollers, seven in all, are essentially
Rritish —with one exception, this exception
being the slim and lissome Madeline Rossi-
ter, who is apparently an octoroon, and
whose eyes are as lights on a sylvan scene.
The other six, including an unimportant
young male pianist, wear unvivacious coun-
tenances, and the men in their early mediaeval
costume suggest “Merrie” England rather
than mirthful varlets. Moreover, the piano
nestling on one side of Sherwood Forest, or
wherever it is, seems out of harmony with a
little pub on the opposite side, where Robin
Hood might have called for a long nut-brown
beer with a dash of sack in it. But the
show, which is supported by a tricky orches-
tra, soon justifies itself. One by one the
solemn-looking strangers reveal ability to
entertain the thoughtless throng, and both in-
dividually and collectively they get there.
The unpromising face of Stroller Desmond
proves to be nearly half his fortune, the rest
of which is settled in his lean dancing legs.
Miss Gwen Lewis shines unexpectedly in
humorous songs at the piano; and, subse-
quently, turns out to be a broad comedienne
with an india-rubber smile. Sister Mena
Brae, starting as a plump, orthodox mezzo-
soprano, develops a turn for mock melodrama
and wild burlesque. The fat basso, Halpin,
does likewise in a lesser degree. Sydney
James and Miss Rossiter aforesaid are the
most frequent and versatile performers in
the co. The decorative lady sings a little,
acts with charm, and is equally graceful and
agile on her toes. Sydney James is an in-
cidental whistler, a good and tuneful com-
edian, and the best ventriloquist Melbourne
has seen. His dummy figure talks better stuff
in a more convincing way than many dum-
mies of the past, the manipulation of it is
oddly ingenious,, and the co. assists to make
it realistic. Judging from the applause of a
crowded audience on Saturday the Strollers
promise to be as popular as the prices.

To-morrow night will see the last for the
present of Gilbert and Sullivan at Her
Majesty’s (Melb.). The co. is finishing in
“The Mikaao,” and if three of them in par-
ticular have cut out the rough-and-tumble
business which disfigured their previous deal-
ings with the opera, the performance will be
better than before. An extravagantly gro-
tesque situation needs no buffooning, anyhow.
But in any case “Mikado” is bound to be the
eo.’s feeblest effort and strongest draw.

is disguised as melodrama all the time. If
the characters in “Baldpate” are understood
(at the finish) to be only a novelist’s concep-
tion of hired mummers playing an unre-
hearsed melodrama in which everybody acts
seriously except the walking corpse, why is
this “mystery” more farcical than a more
transparently impossible series of happen-
ings on the artless melodrama stage? In the
latter case the story is ail virtue and vice,
and in the other it is all dollars and crimes.
“Baldpate,” of course, has the virtue of being
entertaining— i.e., interesting —in an un-
wholesome way. One of the three real charac-
ters is truthfully presented by Cambourne;
and among the alleged assumers of mock
characters Delaney as the nervous murderer,
Lester as the looney hermit, Dudley as the
millionaire, and Stirling as his confidential
man aie more effective than George Bryant
as the cronk mayor or De Lacey as the cronk
policeman. Niblo is the unreal writer of
novels, who does the bulk of the conversation,
and the ladies of the co. are its weakest
members, though Miss Bennett, to be sure,
has the true ingenue charm. In the assumed
character of an adventurous lady journalist,
however, ingenue charm is out of place.

The decline and fall of maidenly virtue
is illustrated in “Her Road to Ruin” at
Melbourne Princess’s this week. In two
cases the damsel becomes the victim of a
hardened sinner’s improper regard, and
strives to maintain the blighter in idleness
on the proceeds of —let us call it profes-
sional affection. The younger of the two,
Mary Dawson, is, however, a humble mem-
ber of the painted sisterhood compared with
the elder houri, Jess Walton, who lures
debased old roues to further dissipation in
the most gilded state that the Willoughby
management can provide. Sad to remark,
all Jess’s efforts are wasted on her unde-
voted blighter, who drops her acquaintance
when she is gaoled for jewel-snatching on
the Thames Embankment, and, later, forgets
her loyal services in a passion for Jess’s
sister May. When he discovers that May
is legally bound to George Cross, he tries
unsuccessfully to separate the pair by pro-
ducing dishevelled Mary from the under-
world as an allegedly vivid patch in Cross’s
past. There never was a past more deserv-
ing of the applause of the Y.M.C.A., and
George easily repudiates the charge with
all the emphasis that clerical raiment affords.
Subsequently Jess is rescued before she
reaches the last pub on the downward path,
and is restored to a journalist with a limp,

while Mary Dawson apparently goes the
full course, giving a liberal rendering of
“The Trio” as Norman Lindsay pictured it.
Vera Remee is George Cross’s partner in
absurdity, and her emotionalism is com-
patible with the state of a lady reduced to
simpering ineptitude by George’s fatal
beauty. Cross plays the good young re-
former as he has played 50 others, while
the leading miscreant of the show, as
revealed by Ronald Riley, is a case of
diablerie restricted by high collars. Next
Saturday “Camille” will be revived, with
George Cross as Ahmahng and Vera Remee

“ THE SEVEN
KEYS TO
BALDPATE,"
AT MEL-
BOURNE
ROYAL.
Elijah Quint by
(Fred Cam-
bourne) grows
suspicious.
The Anderson panto, has finished at Adel-
aide Royal after a highly-successful season
and an enthusiastic farewell. The same
applies to James and his Strollers at Aus-
tral Gardens, which are presently, however,
to open a palais-de-danse and other attrac-
tions. The two companies, with the Reper-
tory Theatre, the Dandies, and most of the
picture houses in Adelaide, combined to give
a big afternoon at the Royal for the Del-'
gians. In a preceding street-procession the
most notable feature was a plucky player
who enacted the Kaiser, with blood-stained
sword, driving two joelgian children on a
rope. They went everywhere among the
crowd, ,on foot, and the Prussian got through
without being “passed” a dirty left. The
Dandies now have no open-air rivals, and
are gathering in their more-or-less faithful
public who had been wandering to the
Strollers. They are a merry and tuneful lot,
with dancing and concerted work as strong
features. The most striking of the films in
sight are a “great war-romance” at West’s,
and Tree as Svengali at Wondergraph. But
the best-filled house of all is the Tivoli, where
the quaint “Photo-drama of the Creation,”
which has been wandering around Australia
and Maoriland for the past three months, is
cramming the place at the old and consistent
charge of nothing at all.
Dead in Adelaide, at 71, after a long
illness, Thomas Scarfe, merchant, of the old
school, keen on business and generous out-
side. He carefully kept out of the limelight,
and gave the 40 years which he lived in
Adelaide to building the big hardware house
of Harris, Scarfe & Co.
“Cremorne”: In Edmund Resch the
war has discovered one patriot who, being
unable to enlist himself, has the courage to
help in the only way open to him—that is,
by drawing upon his cheque-book. Inter-
viewed in Wellington, on his return from
Germany, he remarked: “I would sooner
give £5OOO than be in Europe at the present
time.” Every week the transports are tak-
ing thousands of fellow-Australians who
hope to be in Europe as soon as possible,
because they see that their being in Europe
is the only way to ensure Mr. Resch his
profits from the thirsty. His gift of £5OOO
is after all, not the sacrifice that many
other Australians will make in Europe; but
it is the best he can do. It is true he hasn’t
given the £5OOO yet; but no doubt, with such
strong convictions as he possesses, the patri-
otic fund will not have to wait long.
“Exempt”: Shellbacks have been much
interested in a claim for salvage brought
against the Royal Dutch Packet Co. by J. T.
Wilson, licensed Torres Strait pilot, for
services rendered to the steamer Tasman,
valued with cargo at £lOO.OOO, even reckon-
ing the passengers as ballast. She was
ashore on Bramble Cay, Torres Strait, and
fearing disaster should the weather change
(as it threatened to do), the skipper wire-
lessed for aid. The Inaho Maru’s instru-
ment picked the message up, and, fortu-
nately having Wilson aboard, started to the
rescue through a rain-swept night, and in
circumstances which would have daunted
any but an intrepid and specially-versed
navigator. He safely reached the stranded
Dutchman and hauled her clear before the
blow. The Inaho Maru’s skipper charged
£l5OO for the haulage, but when it came to
the man who alone had made the tow pos-
sible, he was merely offered £45 as pilot’s
fee. As all fees go to the Pilots’ Association,
Wilson was not satisfied, and, failing an
arrangement, sued for £2OOO before Justice
Street (N.S.W.), sitting in Admiralty.
Street, however, after filling Wilson’s plate
with a large helping of praise, gave judg-
ment for only £7O. Along the water-front
they say it was “too blanky light.” But,
then, the water-front is no gentleman when
it’s annoyed.
AT POVERTY POINT.
Edmund Fisher, for 30 years or so The
Bulletin’s theatrical critic in Melbourne,
is the British bulldog of the staff. During
the Boer war, when The Bulletin had an
idea that Britain was all wrong, brother
Fisher dipped his pen in acid and wrote
once a day to assure the rest of the staff
that Britain couldn't be wrong. And now
some shining light of the vaudeville stage
has written to him and spelled him
“Fischer” ! In his old capacity of theatrical
critic Fisher of England has, however,
always been grateful for personal abuse,
accepting it as an indelicate form of flattery.
Therefore he treasures the document and
shares it with his friends:—
Fischer on Bullitine , r ~
Melbourne
You poor old fool, you know as much about critisizeing
a good show as the fool they have here on the
Bullitine. I have read your criticims on the
different vaudeville turns also the different William-
sin’s plays they produce, and I notice that you
always give your rotten Australian actors good
notices and all the Americans you roast. Why you
jouse you would last about two seconds oh a paper
in America, you would certainly give them a big
laugh the way you try to write up a performance in
fact such a person as you 1 don't think would be
allowed to set foot on the ground the land of free
and the brave you would be considered an unde-
sirable alien and shipped back here to the land of
the dirtiest most ignorant people on the face of
the earth. They don’t even bath they don’t know
how to eat I have seen Americans get up from' the
table (tible) as you call it, as they couldn’t stand
for the bad table etiquette you all eat with your
knives and can hear you eat soup a mile away. All
I’ve got to say to you, you rotter, keep on roasting
the American performers, you get £2-10 per wee,i
and 1 get sixty pounds. On the level'll wish some
of our writers could read your criticims and they
would laugh themselves to death you poor old fool
trying to make a living by running down Americans
they know more in a minute than you will ever
know. You’er so far behind the times that you will
never catch up. Thats why you’er all jealous of us
why you don't even know all to walk on the street.
You better go fight with the germans, you dirty
rotten dutchman. Its a wonder to me they would
allow you in this bum country with your dutch name.
“Madame Wiedemann.” who will head L ae
vocal teaching staff at Melbourne University
Conservatorium for her old friend Marshall
Hall, has had a lone- spell of musical life in
that city. Just over 30 years ago she sang
the role of Leonora in a platform perform-
ance of Beethoven’s “Fideles.” That was
the first time the work had been given out
of Europe. The Melbourne Liedertafel sang
the chorus, and the other soloists were Fannie
Simonsen, Beaumont, Walshe, Moroney, Ber-
gin and Gordon Gooch. All but the last two
have passed out, as well as the conductor—
Julius Herz. “Madame Wiedemann” also
accounted for Susanna in “The Marriage of
Figaro,” played at the old Alexandra in
1891, for the Mozart centenary; she was
supported then by Hartung and Himmer,
who still teach in Melbourne. She was the
first, and for years the principal, soloist at
the Marshall Hall orchestra concerts, and
as a teacher has probably handled more
pupils than any other in the Victorian capi-
tal. Incidentally she is the wife of Carl
Pinschof, merchant.
“Jean Sibi”: Fritz Hart, director of the
music factory in Albert-street, East Mel-
bourne, is lamenting the loss of Mrs. Pin-
schof (Wiedemann) and Edward Goll, who
have decided to go over to Marshall Hall’s
rival conservatorium at the Uni. The defec-
tion of the pair is particularly painful to
the hardworking Fritz, and in Goll’s case
amounts to cold ingratitude. In his capacity
as a musical critic for a daily paper. Hart
threw many a complimentary posy at the feet
of Goll, and in other ways helped to push
him into a position which his ladylike art
might never have won. The shaggy Bohe-
mian’s return for these kindnesses has con-
firmed Hart in a desire to keep the Eastern
Hill conservatorium free from foreign influ-
ence, if possible, and rely on English or
Australian talent in future. This deter-
mination is in sharp contrast to the policy
pursued at the University, where the music
is beginning to reek of sauerkraut and
sausage. In addition to Mrs. Pinschof and
Goll aforesaid, the teaching staff includes
the bygone virtuoso, Scharf, while one Soe-
bell, or something like that, has been engaged
to join the band. Whatever the merits of
these people, students will be more than
ever confirmed in the idea that der tail of
der Pritish null-dog is going- to be twisted
and Shermany must vin in der long run.
A cable the other day said that the U.S.A.
were preparing some severe remarks to send
to Britain. The papers which didn’t know
supposed it had something to do with the
blockade of Germany. All wrong. This,
from a U.S.A. paper, tells what is really the
matter: —
We received a letter yesterday from Miss Isabell
D’Armond, the vaudeville player, posted at Sydney,
Australia. Some roughneck in Australia had opened
the letter, read it and approved of it.
He stamped it with a rubber stamp, “Opened by
censor.” It was marked “Personal,” but those
shrinking cowards in Sydney cared nothing about
that.
We would like to ask those Australians what busi-
ness they have to open a letter posted in Sydney to
a citizen of the United States, a neutral country.
One thing it does show, and that is, that England
and all her colonies are scared to death. It also
shows that those Australians, most of them descend-
ants of a lot of transported felons, no-account
younger sons and ticket-of-leave men, regard the
United States with distrust. This opening of letters
addressed to Americans demonstrates the fearful
hysteria that must exist in that faraway land.
The Bulletin is sorry for the Censor.
That well-meaning man has had the idea
that he was preserving the peace in those
small sections where it hasn’t been already
fractured. Now he has opened a letter
written by a music-hall lady from the
O-nited States, even disregarding the fact
that the envelope was plainly marked “Per-
sonal,” and —well, we’ve plainly either
got to assure the Eagle that the Censor has
been boiled in oil or put up with the conse-
quences.
The ignorance of some people! New York
llebald, referring to Granville Barker’s
season at Wallack’s Theatre' (“Androcles
and the Lion,” “The Man Who Married a
Dumb Wife,” etc.), mentions Australia’s
Hugh McCrae. This is how the paper spells
him: Hugh Mcßae. O. P. Ileggie is also
in the co.
“Stargazer” : Seeing Niblo in “The Seven
Keys to Baldpate” reminds me of Niblo in
“Broadway Jones,” and Niblo' in several
other things. The striking resemblance of
all Niblo’s characters to Niblo is the most
astonishing thing about him. To make them
so exactly like Niblo in so many varying
circumstances is itself an effort of genius.
Nobody could do it but an actor peculiarly
American. I think of him as of the smart
salesman type. This class all look and
sound as if they would be wonderful
barrackers for somebody’s patent duplex
suspenders. If they are not recruited from
the great army of American drummers, the
great army of American drummers should
be recruited from them.
Melba “indignantly denied” the daily
paper allegation that she had accepted an
engagement to appear at the Keith vaude-
ville theatres in America for £lOOO a week.
The offer was never made, nor will she ever
do a song turn at a vaudeville theatre, says
Melba. But why her indignation? Bern-
hardt is only one of many famous per-
formers who have appeared at vaudeville
theatres of late years.
“S.”: A surfeit of recent theatrical puff-
stuff in Australian papers has given me thor-
oughly to understand the meaning of the
phrase, “The hire criticism.”
“E. 0.5.” : On Hibernia night, when musi-
cal-director MacCunn, of Her Majesty’s
(Sydney), lifted his rod with the object of
enticing “Gor Save” from his faithful band,
he got the “Wedding March” instead, with a
snowstorm of confetti from round about. The
stage crowd made the discovery that day
that the conductor was about to sign a new
contract with Laura Forester, an Adelaide
girl, who looks after the business affairs of
the Royal Academy of Music at this end.
After the show the company handed the em-
barrassed groom-elect some samples of silver
and a few speeches. The former, at any
rate, will come in handy in a nest at Neutral
Bay.
“J.F.H.”: George Alexander, at one time
London’s handsomest actor, and still con-
sidered so by a crowd of adoring flappers,
has been celebrating the close of 25 years of
management. His first play was “Dr.
Bill,” and though that brought him in a lot
of money, Pinero’s “Second Mrs. Tanque-
ray” and Oscar Wilde’s “Importance of
Being Earnest” have been his biggest suc-
cesses. Like old George Coppin in Mel-
bourne, Alexander has cherished Parlia-
mentary ambitions, which he has not yet
fully realised, although he has represented
a district in the London County Council for
some years. He was originally a draper’s
shop-walker, and his real name is George
Alexander Samson. Mrs. Swanborough, the
manageress under whom he made his d6but,
exclaimed at their first meeting: “We don’t
want any Scriptural names in our company.
You will be George Alexander as long as
you are with us.” And George Alexander
he has been ever since to everybody else.
“Shake-Bake”: A Sydney picture-house
has just shown “A Winter’s Tale,” by one
William Shakspeare. It didn’t get the laughs
or the hands that the film immediately fol-
lowing it —another “tale,” “A Tale of a
Coat” —scored. The secohd “tale” was an-
nounced as by a dramatist named Murphy,

“Coot”: Correspondents to the Melbourne
Argus recently pointed out that the search
for the lost trawler Endeavor “had not been
extended to the Iloyal Company group of
islands, about 400 miles south of Tasmania.”
Searchers would find it an even harder job
to find the islands than the Endeavor; for
although they appear on certain maps, they
don’t exist any more than the devils which
are marked on older charts. ’Way back ifr
the time of the South Sea Bubble some imag-
inative promoter boomed the mythical group
as a paradise of untold beauty and wealth,
and the simple speculator of those stirring
days eagerly bought the scrip of a company
formed to exploit the Eldorado. As late as
1904 the islands appeared on some of the
British Admiralty charts, but in that year
a notice was issued to mariners that the
supposed group didn’t exist and had been
expunged from official publications. Since
then Captain Davis, of the Aurora, made a
special search for the myth on his voyage to
the Macquaries, but of course couldn’t find
it. To have bits of the South Sea bubble
turning up after 200 years shows what a
tough bubble the bubble must have been.

“N.Q.”: I suppose the Council of the
Churches, Women’s Leagues, etc., referred
to in The Bulletin (25/2/T5), look on
the alcoholic and the “social” evils as twins.
Let’s admit it, and go ahead. I have never
heard of one of these well-meaning people
suggesting that every Tom, Dick and Harry
should be allowed to start pubs on their own,
and sell methvlated spirits for gin or sul-

phuric acid and bluestone for whisky. On
the contrary, so far as I know, they clamor
and strive for more control of the publican,
and keener inspection of his wares. They
don’t want the publicans’ customers to have
their bodies ruined and their souls damned
by impure liquor. Why, then, are they so
anxious to allow every Flossie to ply her
trade without control and without guarantee
that her wares are pure? Publicans are
heavily fined for adulteration. Why not
Flossie? I have seen a few bodies ruined by
grog (good and bad). I have also seen a few
destroyed by Flossie. If I were compelled to
ruin my own body by either method, I would
prefer the sulphuric acid and bluestone way.
It would be less painful to me and less dis-
tressing to my friends. Moreover, any chil-
dren I left would have a better chance of
ending their days outside of a lunatic asy-
lum ; and if I had a wife —well, a drunken
husband does not of necessity leave a
drunken widow behind him.
Earle Hermann, the young man who
arrived in Sydney six or eight years ago and
started breeding companies as other men
breed pigeons, was last week asked to ex-
plain one small matter of alleged forgery and
uttering. The only explanation available was
that accused was an epileptic; on which the
defence proceeded to tip out drayloads of
information on the subject of epilepsy. After
the jury had surveyed enough of it to build
a Pyramid, it said it didn't have any use
for any more. Then the defence shut, like a
trap and sat back, and the jury found Her-
mann guilty of uttering, with a strong recom-
mendation to mercy on account of the epi-
lepsy. “Of course that’s a verdict of not
guilty on account of insanity,” said the wait-
ing Wise, K.G. His Honor couldn’t see it.
“Oh, but we were stopped from showing con-
clusively that this man’s epilepsy produced
temporary insanity,” urged Wise. “There
must certainly be a new trial.” And if there
is it will be because the jury said it didn’t
want the threatened further drayloads of
medical and other information, and it appar-
ently wasn’t anybody’s business to say what
the probable consequences of stopping the
avalanche would be. The Law hasn’t always
even the sense of Balaam’s ass. If that
quadruped could only bray, it anyhow could
bray at the right time.

Adelaide’s new motor-’buses have already
had a fatal clash with the electric trams.
A car caught a ’bus on the rails, and pushed
it into a power-standard, which bent over
and dropped its overhead wire. Instantly
the splashed petrol was in flames, and the
two vehicles, locked together, had everything
burnable about them burnt. The only vic-
tim was a small child sitting beside the ’bus-
driver. He was snatched from his seat
within 30 seconds, but that was the best
part of 30 seconds too late.
EXPERIENCE.
RECRUITING OFFICER (to light-horse candidate): “I suppose you’ve had experience
with horses?”
ARDENT PUNTER: “ Experience! Blime , I’ve been doin’ me wages in on ’em reg’lar for
the last ten years.”
Within the last few days three Sydney
people, two of them policemen, have had 10
shots at three escaping thieves. All three
targets got clean away, and if any of them
were hit they didn’t mention it or leave
bloodstains for reference. Apparently a
man is never safer than when ue is being
shot at by a breathless amateur with a revol-
ver. In fact, it gives him a fresh interest
in life, and wipes off that rust of old age
which is really deadly.
A tale of dry horrors in the boarding-
house :
When one of the venerable pumps belonging to
Sydney’s Water Board failed in the 1 dead centre
of a recent heat wave, the news was broken to us by
the bathroom-tap, which, on getting its head turned
in the usual manner, just hissed like an. angry
ostrich. I went and sat on the back steps where
there seemed to be a suspicion of a draught. A
wild, shrill female voice wailed from the palpitant
dark: “Somebody ought to be shot! There isn’t a
drop of water in the house!” A dry child, hearing,
the cry of distress, lifted up its voice and asked
shrilly: “Why isn’t there any water, mother?” And
the wild female voice replied: “Oh, 1 don’t know!
This sort of thing never happened in England!”
From the far end of the dark house a petulant voice
chimed in: “Labor caucuses and things like that —-
that’s what it is! I always tell my-husband not to
vote for them!” After that there was aimless run-
ning to and fro with jugs. Everybody told everybody
else what they most wanted to wash—faces, dishes,
blouses or children. The worst fool attempted to
make tea with ginger beer, and the second-worst
fool. wasted a pound of rice by furtively throwing
handfuls of it on the roof and shouting the glad
news that it was raining. At last enough water was
begged to make tea,- and the unwashed dishes re-
mained stacked on the kitchen tables. Everybody sat
outside and sipped soft drinks and beer in a sort of
contented misery till the ass who had. thrown the rice
on the roof hurried out with the news that he had
just looked at the thermometer in the hall and it
showed 90deg. ! At once there was an indignant
chorus of denial; but on his offering excitedly to
look again, the lawyer’s clerk cried wretchedly from
the small grass plot: “Oh, for God’s sake, don’t light
another match!” Clearly and coolly through the
breathless night came the slow boom of a far town-
hall clock chiming 11. Simultaneously a commotion
became audible within doors. “Harry! What are
you doing in the bathroom ? The water isn’t on yet,
is it?” Everybody sat up and listened. “No, of
course, the d —d water isn’t on! But I’ve got a
bottle of iced beer here, and, after I’ve had a scrub-
down with the clothes-brush and hosed myself with
your scent-spray, I’m going to lie in the bath and
wait.for it. Good-night!”
“Hare Court” with his wig off: —
It is a theory of mine that most people connected
with the law in Australia are mad. Take this
“Judge” and “Mr. Justice” row in N. S. Wales.
As a matter of fact, none of the Judges are entitled
in law to call themselves anything at all. The
Charter of Justice says nothing about it. Neither
do the Constitution Acts, State or Federal. Neither
does the District Court Act. To be sure, the com-
paratively modern Judicature Acts expressly confer
these titles and others on certain specified Judges in
the United Kingdom, but they do nothing of the sort
as regards Australia; and, in any case, our Judges
had antecedently adopted their present titles. Maybe
Bulstrode, or the Rotuli Curias Regis or Pollexfen
or other medievalists support them. I doubt if they
do, and in any event no one else does, and moreover
these ancients have no authority.
Nothing but a sense of humor, or ignorance of his
powers, restrains a plain Beak from calling himself
Lord High Dispenser of Justice Undefiled.. He could
even insist on being called Viscount. Or Your Grace.
However, he is satisfied with Your Worship.
So far as the Heydon. trouble goes, there is this
to be said. The Cullen prowd started as an avowed
imitation of already existent courts, and thus felt
bound to copy the titles of those courts. Heydon
started as an entirely novel kind of “Superior Court.”
Had he insisted on taking a new line and being, called
“Your Lordship,” he would have been within his
rights; and it must appear to the reasonable that he
should be commended for his moderation in this
matter rather than chided for arrogance.
Meanwhile, the “Your Honor” distinction is getting
as cheap as Iron Crosses. Even the two laymen and
the barrister who make up the Inter-State Commis-
sion are after it. They don’t claim it in so-many
words, but if one of the three refers to the pro-
nouncement of another he invariably observes “as His
Honor said.” On appeal recently from this Com-
mission, counsel kept repeating in his address the
phrase, “What their Honors said.” And each time
the High Court bitterly inquired “What who said?”
Who would imagine that all our Notaries Public
are appointed by the Archbishop of Canterbury? Or
that the document intituling some humble Yiddish
attorney is addressed to (say) “our trusty and well
beloved in Christ, Sol Isaacstein” ?
Which reminds me that I once saw the late Justice
Cohen trying a case in which little Dan Levy was on
one side and an obvious co-religionist on the other.
The dispute, I fancy, was about some articles of
ecclesiastical raiment which had been stolen from
the Ark of the Tabernacle in one of our synagogues
on the Feast of Yum Kippur. A witness went into
the box and was sworn with his hat on. Cohen
turned to him and said: “What is your Christian
name?”

A well-fed Sydney citizen arose after meat
the other day, and in the presence of the
press “deplored” the decision of Holman not
to sanction an “art union” in aid of the
Belgian Fund, mentioning that he was ready
to ffgive a £5OO cottage as a prize.” Well,
why doesn’t he? Nobody stands in the way
of well-fed citizens giving £5OO cottages to

“R.N.”: 11.M.5. Kent, in smashing the
Dresden, avenged an old friend, and paid off
a debt to the sunken Monmouth. These
ships were on the China station together, and
during a typhoon in July, 11)08, the Mon-
mouth did the Kent a good turn when the
latter had dangerously dragged her buoy in
Hongkong Harbor. In the following year
the Kent went ashore in the Gulf of ITchi-li,
ahd it was again the Monmouth that
answered her wireless and stood by for the
34 hours the storm lasted.
“Ganglion”: Two special hospitals have
been established here in England for patients
from the Front who have no wounds, but
are suffering from shock. Both are badly
needed. It was an old
axiom that soldiers after
the clash of a single great
battle required weeks to
recover their fighting form.
The present war goes all
the time, and nerves are
badly jangled now and
then. The profession is
making observations on
this subject. But they
learn nothing very new.
In the old pre-chloroform
days of the Peninsula War,
Irish and Highland troops
were always to the fore in
every scrap; but it was
noted that those men who
fought most like tigers in
actual battle cried out
most in their pain under
the surgeon’s knife. Cowardice doesn’t con-
sist in making a noise nor courage in silence.
Dear Bulletin, —It’s up to someone to
stir up those responsible for the cooking at
this Liverpool (N.S.W.) Expeditionary
Force’s camp. The boilers in which food
and drink are handled are never properly
scoured, and the tucker is loaded with sand.
A par. in a recent Bulletin says that
travelling camp-kitcliens have proved un-
satisfactory at Broadmeadows camp (Vic.).
As a matter of fact, the ladies in charge of
the funds, which provided these “kitchens,”
bought them without consulting the authori-
ties, and, unfortunately, got the wrong
article. There is no doubt about the effici-
ency and economy of the type approved by
the military people. That was demon-
strated long before this war broke loose;
and the commandants in all the States re-
commended their use. That being so, why
are we not using them? Another growl: In
the canteen the prices charged are (except as
regards tobacco) generally 50 per cent, in
excess of Sydney prices. It seems to me that
the Sosh Tiger has again been lambed down.
Would you mind saying once more that our
old friend Pirate Enterprise is on deck? —-

“F.H.”: Few Australian women go to
afternoon tea without their boots, except in
the privacy of their own homes. However,
one transpired the other day in Melbourne’s
newest rag and tea emporium. About a dozen
victims were sipping their drug when a stout,
fiercely frocked-and-hatted dame roamed in
on stockinged feet. She surrounded a table
in the middle of the room, consumed a pile
of hand-painted pastry, drank a billy of tea,
shook the crumbs off her feathers, and
thumped out like a small elephant walking on
its hands. I’m still wondering whether this
is a fresh instalment of fashion, or whether
madame had merely filled in time in the tea-
room while her corn-covers were being soled
and heeled at the adjacent cobbler’s.

“Bee Dee”: “5.1 i.,” who writes (B.
11/3/T5) about Tasmanian railways,
shouldn’t spring rumors about new stations
on us so suddenly. If Hobart’s station were
rebuilt they couldn’t do the things they do
now. One recent Sunday night I stood near
the booking office, while outside an engine
endeavored to get its breath. Presently an
official came out, scanned the horizon, and
asked if I was going by “the Suburban.” I
denied the charge, so he bawled to the
driver: “All right, Bill, you’ve got the lot.”
Now, would it be possible to do that if there
was accommodation for more than one train?
The passengers might get mixed. And if
they had more accommodation they might be
expected to keep small change. I lately tried
to buy four tickets to Launceston with a
£5-note; but the clerk either hadn’t
change, or wasn’t going to be taken down by
anyone from the mainland. My mate tried
him, too, but no go—we had to find gold
and silver or walk. A proud resident of the
Isle informs me that Tasmanian trains are
the fastest in the world —when you’ve allowed
for the curves and the grades and the gauge
and the cows on the line and the accidental
stoppages. He seems honest, so I’m ready,
to believe him.
“Medicus” on the treatment of venereal
diseases by pharmaceutical chemists: —
I know of a case of gonorrhoea treated by an
experienced chemist. Some weeks afterwards the
patient married and infected his wife to such an
extent that his baby was in danger of total blind-
ness. In this case if the patient had been treated by
a reputable practitioner the chances are that the man
would have known the responsibilities he incurred
when he married. In fact, he would have been well
and fit for marriage, or he would not have married
when he did ; or he would not have jeopardised a
child’s sight. Chemists are quacks when they
prescribe, or profess to treat, or do anything else in
the medical way. No case of venereal disease is
“simple.” This is a fact which men who expose
themselves to contagion should grasp. It is through
these and other sexual diseases that knaves practising
as chemists and similar vampires batten on their
fool-victims.
“God punish England”—so they greet
Each other in the public street.
But surely He won’t try a feat
Which has the very Kaiser beat.

Among French residents in Australia
none is more entitled to a hearing than
Miss Soubeiran, co-principal for very many
years of one of the best-known schools in
Sydney. This is her appeal:—
The first official report of German atrocities in
Northern France has just reached me.
As I read I feel in the grip of a most malignant
nightmare. The mind revolts ; it refuses to accept as
true that such inhuman cruelties can have been wil-
fully perpetrated in our world, under our sun, by
men of flesh and blood like ourselves, who have, like
ourselves, been suckled by human mothers. We
must be reading one of the tales born of the distorted
imagination of one of the writers of the Middle Ages,
revelling in the fiendish doings of insane devils.
No ; in quiet, measured, dignified language, proofs
are set down. The dates, the names are given ; the
priest, the Mayor, a cloud of witnesses vouch for
the truth of each horror, the mutilations, the ruins,
the graves of silent but irrefutable testimony.
In this picture of “the abomination of desolation”
one short sentence stands out. It burns bright, a
light flinging forth beams of patriotic beauty over
the desolate scene: “ Throughout our sad pilgrimage
we did not hear one word of plaint.”
The French-Australian League is working its hard-
est for those brave folks whose lips are sealed by
their passionate patriotism. It is following with
garments and food in the wake of the advancing
army. Its “Loaf Fund” is doing its best to allow
everyone the privilege of contributing to the splendid
work.
This fund was unconsciously initiated by a very
small Australian child. Overhearing her elders
speak of the bitter distress in Northern France and
of the sufferings endured by children like herself,
she wept, because- she had “only fourpence”! To
comfort her someone said: “It is not only fourpence,
dear ; it is a loaf of bread.” And like a flash came
the thought: “What relief could he offered to those
people of our North if every Australian gave one
loaf!” Think of it! Five million loaves!
The idea was mentioned to a few friends. It
found favor; it seemed so modest, so practical a
request, it could interfere with the interests of none.
As usual, those who had least responded first. Even
old-age pensioners, hearing of the loaf idea, stinted
themselves to give, and the first, unorganised effort
of three weeks has resulted in 10,000 loaves being
cabled two days ago to the ruins of what was once a
village behind Soissons. This week French children
will be eating bread provided for them by their
Australian friends.
It is now proposed to organise more widely an
appeal which seems thus to strike immediate answer
from the hearts of those who hear it. Everyone in
Australia is to be given the chance of sending a loaf
to the children of Northern France. Cards are being
printed. Florence Rodway has promised to see to
the cover; ledgers are ordered in which to keep
count of those million loaves ; for who would not be
ashamed to refuse?
But why wait for the cards? The children are
hungry now! Send the price of one loaf to the
Secretary, 113 Pitt-street, and give another when
the collecting-card comes your way. Do not forget
that 4d. will keep a family from starvation for a
whole day.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Lady Ida Sitwell has been sentenced to three
months’ imprisonment. Lady Ida said that her hus-
band had several times previously paid her debts.
She admitted asking her son, an officer in a crack
regiment, to induce his fellow-officers to back her
bills. She promised to use her family influence to
get the men elected to the Marlborough Club, and the
women into Society. She had also borrowed £145
from her butler and some other servants.— Cable.
Lady Jane is short of money.
All her friends have lent her quids ;
Now she calls the butler “honey,”
For she cannot face the Yids.
Ev’ryone keeps mum about it
In the proud old British way ;
But there’s not the slightest doubt it
Will go on till newsboys shout it
On some dark and doleful day.
Lady Jane is short of money and the butler’s going
grey.
Footmen’s savings melt before her;
Servants in dark corners hide;
Relatives all yearn to store her
Where no money is supplied.
Jafie has worked the social dodges,
And the snobs have paid her fee ;
Now the gardener (Mr. Hodges),
Skirmishing ’midst beds and lodges,
Mutters: “Oh, she’s up a tree!
Now, begob, she’s done it proper! Blest if she ain’t
up a tree.”
In the, halls of ancient splendor,
Lady Jane, by debtors served,
Sils with toes upon the fender,
Red of eye and quite unnerved.
At the bell’s insistent trilling,
Comes a servile footman-blot:
“Wilkinson! have you a shilling?”
And the worm, his poor chest filling,
Gastis: “Me lady, Hi ’ave not!
Hand Hi may remark, me lady, you liar just a bit
too ’ot!”
Over Jane the pall of Ruin
Gathers darkly day by day,
Like a storm-cloud off the Leeuwin,
But her cringing servants stay;
She has bound them i firmly to her
With the wrought-steel bonds of debt;
So they, trembling, watch her blew her
Last few loans. Though they see through her,
Their lost cash thej' can’t forget,
So they snivel, hope and follow in a wretched, servile
sweat.
Lady Jane is bound for prison, but she has her
servants yet!

Lyons, Tasmania’s Minister for Educa-
tion, is an ex-school-teaclier, too.
Thirty-five years ago a young Scot named
Wullie Lawrie decided that life would be
more enjoyable in a climate fit for a white
man, and therefore set out for the Northern
Territory. His bonnet and sporran have
ornamented that part ever since, and when
he arrived South last week on holiday in
long white whiskers and a genial frame of
mind the first thing he noticed was the
devastating effects of the climate on the
Sydney girls. “They should go to the Terri-
tory,” he insisted. “You meet the finest
women on the continent there.”
Judge Gordon (S.A.) has a common-
sense disregard for the red-tape of the law,
but he can’t quite ignore it. The other day
Dasliwood, Iv.C., hurried into court in a
wig, but without a gown. “I will consent
to see you,” said the Judge, pleasantly,
“despite the fact that you are unrobed.”
Then the Iv.C. awoke to the fact of his
technical nudity, and promised to dress
decently when he had finished his argument
of the moment. No time was wasted, any-
way.
“S.”: “Rolf Boldrewood” Browne took
small pride in himself as a literary light.
That side was kept very much in the back-
ground when he figured at Governmentouse
or other social flares. I once heard him in-
troduced as “Mr. Browne, author of ‘Rob-
bery Under Arms,’ you know.” He glowed
crimson. “Excuse me,” he said with some
asperity, “that was one Rolf Boldrewood,
wasn’t it?”
A cousin of Admiral Jellicoe is patiently
laboring in the Anglican vineyard at Denili-
quin (N.S.W.). He is the Rev. Jellicoe
Rogers, who shows the same activity in
harassing Sin in the Riverina as his uncle
is displaying towards the fleet of Satan’s
understudy in the North Sea.
A NOCTURNE.
Australia, besides supplying Britain with
soldiers from time to time, has given a few
weapons of war as well, from the Brennan
torpedo to the new machine gun of a few
months ago. The inventor of that gun, W.
B. Burton, has now come forward with a
range-finder, whose purpose is to annihilate
the saying that it takes a ton of lead to kill
a man. The invention, a simple contrivance,
is now on its way to the war lords.
Recently deceased J. F. M. Fraser, Iv.C.,
of Dunedin (M.L.), who had pursued Costs
among the banks and braes for twa-and-
thirty year, got most of his early education
in Victoria. His wife was a daughter of
the well-remembered “Dick” Ireland, Q.C.
Fraser was always a bit of an oddity in the
eyes of the local Sandies, as he much pre-
ferred driving and motoring to whusky and
haggis, and had never been detected behind
a sporran.
From the Office Deacon :—•
The martial family of that impetuous Methodist
parson at Murgon (Q.) mentioned by the secular
staff in a recent Bulletin in consequence of three
sons having fled to the field of blood, can be equalled
by the family of Rev. R. McKeown, a noted breeder
of Irish terriers, and, incidentally, Anglican parson
of Waverley, Sydney. He has seven sons. One is
serving in Egypt; another, Norman, not unknown as
actor and novelist, has a commission in a British
cavalry regiment; a third, who in peaceful times was
in the office of the Perpetual Trustee Co. (Sydney), is
handling a rifle in Belgium; a fourth, this one a
B.E. of Sydney Uni., is working at Tliornycroft’s
yards in England, building warships ; and a fifth, a
parson in England, volunteered for the war but was
restrained by his ecclesiastical superiors. The other
two sons are respectively the heavy tenor of the
latest Gilbert and Sullivan opera co., and a parson in
the Brotherhood of the Good Shepherd at Gilgandra
(N.S.W.). Two nephews of the Waverley rector are
with the Australian troops in Egypt, and a brother-
in-law was one of the Australian force which captured
German New Guinea.
THE WRONG DIRECTION.
The Kaiser, after a service in the park at Nivbowo
Castle, in Poland, spoke as follows: “We should trust
firmly in our Great Allies up Above, who will help a
just cause to victory.— Cable.
THE BOSS OF T OPHET: “But see here,
partner, my pace is down below.”
A few years ago thei'e were four men
in the Leg. Council of N. S. Wales who
were known as “The Quartette”—H. C.
Dangar, J. J. Calvert (Clerk), F. M. Dar-
ley and John Lackey. They were all born
in 1830. Lackey, the President, was the
first to go, aged 73. Barley, who had be-
come Chief Justice, was next, aged 80. Cal-
vert has just followed, 85. Dangar, the
survivor, was the oldest of the bunch. Mr.
Calvert was for 61 years in the civil service,
59 of them being spent in Parliament House.
He was the last of those who attended the
Parlces banquet to the survivors of the first
Parliament, May 23, 1887.
R. It. P. Hickson, one of Sydney’s oldest
public servants, and recently pensioned off
on the age limit from the chairmanship of
the Sydney Harbor Trust, has left Sydney
for Fiji under engagement to the Fiji Gov-
ernment as supervising engineer for the new
harbor works at Suva. In his refusal to
grow old, Hickson resembles his former col-
league, Henry Deane, who, after being re-
tired from Ma’s service on account of his
years, was appointed consulting engineer
in charge of the Commonwealth’s Trans-
continental Railway.
D. L. Algie, M.A. (honors in Latin and
English), and D. Outram (first section
8.A.) were among the successful candi-
dates at the recent degree examinations in
Maoriland. Both are sightless. Pupils of the
Jubilee Institute for the Blind at Auckland,
they kept terms at the district University
College in the ordinary way. Algie had to
have seven text books specially transcribed
into Braille. Outram, having the lower
hurdle to get over, took notes at lectures
and pricked out his own summaries after-
wards.
Once more the invincible Smiths! A villa
at Darling (Vic.) was raffled the other day
in aid of the Patriotic fund. It was won by
a young woman named Smith, with a ticket
given her by her young man, who is also
named Smith. The Bulletin once had an
article asking “What shall we do with our
Smiths?” It is coming to this —what should
we do without them?
The Bulletin a year ago remarked that
the Commonwealth Defence Department had
a chance to get ahead of the War Offices of
Europe by adopting the Caldwell machine
gun. The chance still offers as regards
War Offices, although the deadly Australian-
born weapon lias been now taken up by the
British Admiralty. A London co. has
bought the syndicate’s rights for “£55.000
cash, plus a royalty on all guns manufac-
tured in Britain, and 10 per cent, of the
consideration received from the sale of
foreign rights or licenses.” This deal is
conditional on the Admiralty’s final approval
of a new sample gun now being made, which
approval is apparently a foregone conclu-
sion. Captain Moss and the inventor nego-
tiated the sale, and the co. has engaged
Caldwell at a salary of £lOOO a year to
supervise the construction of the goods.
Before he left Australia he was the unas-
suming boss of a brass-turnery in Fitzroy
(Melb.). where lie gave three or four years
of his spare time to the invention. To see
him handle his double-barrelled machine and
scatter bullets upon the floor of his little
office at the rate of 1000 a minute was to
believe in the gun and the young man behind
it. But at that time no one guessed how
opportune it would be.
‘‘Melb”: Money is still
wanted for the Flinders
statue, and a St. Kilda mag-
nate has made a tempting offer
of a big subscription if the
stone is planted there. The
bait ought not to be even sniffed
at. Because Captain Cook
was thrust out of the way on
St. Kilda Beach, so as to be
in front of the donor’s house, it
is contended that Flinders
ought to be there too! The
advocates of such grotesqueries
are beside, themselves. No; the
right place -for Flinders is on
the Flinders and Swanston
streets corner, where the
Cathedral authorities have
offered a site for nothing. Yet
there exists a body of cranks
wanting to set him up at the
Treasury : steps, at the top of
Spring-street; while others
have an idea that he would be
all right at the nondescript
place where the Burke and
Wills statue was shunted to, in
Spring-street, near Lonsclale-
street.
Frank Birtles, the overland-
ing motorist, has left Adelaide
again, planning to follow
the Burke-and-Wills track right up to the
Gulf, taking photographs, and perhaps re-
covering some of their records buried along
the route. Then he hopes to go from Cen-
tralia to Perth, and finally—perhaps two
years hence —to break his own Perth-to-
Sydney record.
Captain W. Uliek M. Campbell, killed in
action with his regiment, was of straight
descent from the father of Australian Com-
merce, Robert Campbell, who came from
Calcutta to Sydney in 179(5. This pioneer
had a son, Robert Capipbell, who was Trea-
surer in the first and second Cowper Min-
istries, and died in harness in 1859 from
overwork. He had a son, W. R. Campbell,
who sat for many years in the Assembly,
and was then appointed to the Leg. Coun-
cil. Captain Ulick was his son; and on
the female line he came from the Palmers,
the Rileys and the Deas-Thomsons, all well-
known names in the early history of Aus-
tralia.
From a hardened old pressman :
Adela Paukhurst is turned into a lioness by a
leading article in the Argus, attacking her and
demanding that she be flung into the deepest dungeon
beneath the castle moat. Maybe the article was sen-
sible enough ; but it was stupid in bringing a 50-ton
steam hammer to crush a butterfly. The consequence
was that Adela.' sprung to notoriety, drew me and

General in Melbourne , attends a jumble sale.

THE REWARD OF VIRTUE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I am pleased to be able to saj 7 that I am leaving
to my successor a department much stronger, and
more efficiently organised that it has ever previously
been in its history....l am glad to say that rigid
economy which I have always exercised enables me
to leave my successor quite flush of funds. I reel
deeply having' to leave uncompleted the big national
developmental works which I have commenced. ... 1
admit I have had a pretty hard time while initiating
these reforms. — Official swan song of Arthur Griffith,
of N.S. 1T 7 ., on exchanging the portfolio of Works for
that of Education.
As I’m giving up my charge, I’ll endeavor to enlarge
On the work that I’ve been doing for the State!
(Ta-rant-ta-ra !)
And my trumpet’s martial ring through the corridors
shall sing
Of a Minister whose glories coruscate!
(Ta-rant-ta-ra !)
For the good of all the nation, I’ll give Virtue
commendation
And award the leather medal to the man who’s won
it. See!
With a gesture compliment’ry, in the presence of
the gentry,
I affix the treasured honor to the breast of Arthur G!
Oh f advertisement’s a jool,
And that Minister’s a fool
Who retreats in modest silence to the shelf!
So I do not hesitate
To describe myself as Great
And secure the printed V.C. for myself.
While the calling trumpet toots, note the large offi-
cial boots
My successor will be called upon to fill!
(Ta-rant-ta-ra !)
In my old official seat he will sigh for larger feet,
As he rests his own upon the window-sill.
(Ta-rant-ta-ra!)
As a public benefactor and a departmental actor,
As a pattern and example for the raw aspiring lad,
And the men who shove behind me, nothing you can
say can blind me,
And I really cannot help it if my frankness makes
you mad !
Ever since I was a youth,
For plain honesty and truth,
I have harbored quite a passion. So you see
There is nothing to be done
When I see that I’m the one
But to let me pass the cake to Arthur G!
Why should gladness be concealed when a man of
worth’s revealed
In the act of giving up his honored chair?
(Ta-rant-ta-ra!)
Shall that man not tell the earth who’s aware of his
own worth ?
Must he wait for Death his value to declare?
(Ta-rant-ta-ra !)
No! I’ll blow my little trumpet! If you like it
not, pray lump it!
I'll provide my own glad fanfare as I climb upon the
shelf,
And to soothe your agitation you can take this
information;
Quite the best reward of Virtue is to talk about
itself.
Since my youth have I abhorred
Virtue’s usual reward ;
So I sound the paper trump Pub-lic-i-tee!
You may mutter what you please,
But I’ll listen at my ease,
For I cannot see a flaw in Arthur G. !
In the character or work of Arthur G. !

The WILD CAT
COLUMN
British Tobacco Co. (Australia), Ltd.
—This co.’s assets consist exclusively of
shares in subsidiary cos. and accumulated
profits. The Dixson cos. and the Cameron
co. formed the spine and most of the flesh
and hide of the new concern. The Dixsons
had already done a considerable amount of
absorption, so that when the new . concern
was fixed up in 1903 there wasn’t much
left outside. The present co. isn’t exactly
the 1903 co., but there isn’t any essential
difference. Seeing that practically all the
assets arc shares in subsidiary cos. which
don’t publish accounts, you couldn’t tell
enough from the B. T. Co.’s figures to re-
commend a widow with 11 young children
to put all she had (except the children) into
the concern. She might do a lot worse than
put the children there and chance it ; for
there are not many people in Australia or
anywhere else who treat their employees so
well. The authorised capital is £5,500,000,
of which £1,500,000 is in 6 p.c. cumulative
pref. shares. But the total issued is
£351,737 less, the shortage being made up
as follows :—Pref., £15,273 ; ordinary,
£336,464. There is an employees’ trust, to
which £33,536 of profit was credited last
year; and probably a certain number of
shares have been left unissued in order to
provide investment for this employees’ trust
money. There have also been issues of
bonus shares.
The 6 p.c. div. on prefs. calls for £89.084.
I )educt that from the total disclosed profit
for the year to the end of January, and
£443,740 is left. (That is after allowing
for the employees’ bonus.) On the ordinary
capital £443,740 is equal to about £l2 2s.
p.c. Quarterly dividends are paid: last year
the payments were 11 p.c., and a final of 1
p.c. is awaiting distribution. This total of
12 p.c. absorbs practically all the profit.
Ostensibly only about £5OOO is added to
reserves. But you don’t know what reserves
have been provided by the subsidiary cos.
The directors say the figures “do not include
the co.’s interest in the undivided profits of
the subsidiary cos.,” and naturally they
don’t indicate what there is in those stock-
ings. Still there probably isn’t anything
like enough to counterbalance the £806.781
which has hitherto been shown as the capi-
tal represented by goodwill and other hypo-
thetical assets.

There is, however, another way of putting
it. Under the constitution of this office a
definite contract is offered to the public. A
purely mutual office can guarantee nothing,
having no capital to put up as a guarantee.
But this office, having now £108,225 of paid
capital—which amount is. by the way, to be
increased —undertakes definitely to pay the
face value of the policy; moreover, it under-
takes that the whole business of the society
shall be done at a certain maximum expense
rate, to the advantage, of course, of the
policy-holders’ bonuses. In return for that
contract, the guarantee of a maximum
expense rate and other things, the
people who do the guaranteeing take
one-fifth of the profits. They manage
the business; and the theory is that
the system benefits policy-holders also,
because in making profits for itself the
co. must make at least four times more for
them. Unquestionably a most excellent or-
ganisation has grown up, and the results,
while they have been fine for the co., have
been admirable also for the policy-holders.
The sort of management that has been
evolved may be judged by the certificates
given by the trustees for the two big and
older mutual offices whose affairs the co. has
taken over. The Widows’ Fund trustees
said last year (and they were all people re-
sponsible for the old office’s management) :
“The rate of bonus now paid for the third
year in succession represents on the average
an increase of 100 p.c. over the rate of bonus
distributed by the Australian Widows’ Fund
prior to the union.”
Rut J. P. Garvan, the founder, was the
pioneer of a new idea in insurance; and new
ideas in insurance are, as a rule, sniffed at
suspiciously. Which is a very good thing;
because there is no investment about which
a man ought to feel so much confidence be-
fore committing himself. Tf you think well
of the Transcontinental Bank you deposit
your money in it. Presently you don’t think
so well of it, and take the deposit to the
Bank of Fisher’s Strategy. Meantime you
have grown 10 years older and developed
something that may shorten your life. But
the Bank of Fisher’s Strategy doesn’t trouble
about that. It is very different with a life
insurance transaction. If you make a bad
choice or a bad bargain to begin with, you
are liable to have to stick to it, because no
other office will now have you. And even if
you are still sound you have more or less
wasted valuable years, and must now face a
very much increased annual premium. J. P.
Garvan had thus to make good in a small
way before the public would come in num-
erously. He died before great success was
gained; but it was not long afterwards that
the seal was set on the system when two
mutual offices, both old and both highly re-
spectable (in fact, one of them had been
suffering from respectability), came under
the roof, and handed their affairs over to
be managed on the new system —which,
after all, as applied to every other sort of
enterprise, is a system as old as business it-
self.
In the early days of the Citizens’ the office
simply wasn’t game to say that it took one-
fifth of the profits. The fact was it couldn’t
show that it had given anything in return.
Now the case is different; and the division is
plainly set out. In the table at the top of
these remarks the shareholders’ bonus is in-
cluded with the claims to make the thing
uniform, that having been the old practice.
But if the shareholders’ bonus is treated as
part of the expenses —in which case it must
of course be then assumed that all the profits
go to the policy-holders—the figures work out
as follows: —

In both the tables the amount shown as
written off last year is £1541. An addi-
tional £lOO,OOO has been put to general re-
serve, and is included with the amount
shown as added to the funds.
When a life office is being formed tables
of premium rates are compiled. According
to various mortality tables, which don’t differ
very much, every average person has a cer-
tain expectation of life. If he insures for
(say) £5OO, and has on insuring an expecta-
tion of life of 20 years, the office must
collect a premium such as will produce £5OO
in 20 years by the investment of the annual
instalments at a given rate of interest, plus
enough to pay current management exes. Any
bonuses that the policy-holder may get are
derived from (1) the earning of interest, in
excess of the assumed rate ; (2) the running
of the business at a smaller expense than
was assumed; and (3) the selection of lives
so that the insured will on the average live
more than the expected period, which will
of course mean that they will pay more pre-
miums and their instalments will earn more
interest. llow much is available every year
for bonuses is determined by valuation not
merely of the assets, but of the liabilities
under the policies. Every policy ought , to
have so much accumulated towards meeting
it. The excess is available for distribution
as profit or bonus. But obviously the
amount which ought to be accumulated de-
pends on what you think the money already
in hand and all future instalments will earn.
For instance, £lOO invested at 3 p.c. com-
pound interest would in 20 years amount to
only £lBO, whereas at 5 p.c. it would amount
to £205. You can therefore make your bonus
big or little by assuming a high or a low
future rate of interest. If you assume a
high rate, you make your present bonuses
high at the expense of future bonuses; if
you assume a low rate, then you keep in
hand actually more than is necessary to
meet your policy liabilities. Which explains
this paragraph in the M.L.C. report:—
As the Company is earning £4 16s. Bd, p.c.
on its funds, the fact that all the M.L.C. Ordinary
Branch contracts are valued on the assumption that
it will earn only 3 p.c. on its funds and the M.L.A.
and A.W.F. contracts on the assumption that it will
earn only 31 p.c. on its funds provides for a very
large reserve which could be drawn upon in the event
of any necessity arising. For example, if all the con-
tracts were valued at 4 p.c. there would at once be
a fund of over £590,000 released to provide for any
contingency. This is in addition to the sum of
£lOO,OOO which the Directors have this year passed
to General Reserve. The financial position of the
Company is thus seen to be particularly strong.
Or there would be £500,000 released to pro-
vide for bonuses. This, in short, is an in-
ternal reserve.
The surplus disclosed on the present valu-
ation is £244,305, of which £30,624 goes to
the shareholders. (The latter are not en-
titled on the old M.L.A. and A.W.F. policies
to the one-fifth before mentioned.) The
amount to be distributed among policy-
holders will be £213,584. The premiums
received last year amounted to £796,244.
Thus, after paying to the shareholders their
dues, 26.1 p.c. of all premiums paid are
returnable to policy-holders either in cash
or in added insurance. This result suffi-
ciently commends itself.

This is another of the Maoriland concerns
which have a lot of other people’s deposit
money lent out on mortgage, and which,
having hardly any cash in hand, ought to
pray twice a day that nothing will happen
to make the depositors in a hurry. Here
are the figures :
1904. 1912. 1913. 1914.
Capital and re-
serves .. £86,342 £130,062 £132,649 £140,287
Liabilities .. 243,555 241,771 238,718 256,766
Advances . . 319,517 351,663 347,988 359.099
Freeholds . . 12,068 10,001 10,001 10,001
Liquid . . 3,563 10,169 13,377 22,453
Of course, as in practically all such cases,
the position would be always quite right if
the co. were always given plenty of time
to get the mortgage in and realise its fore-
closures and other securities; but depositors
have a beastly habit of being most impatient
at the very time it is most impossible for
any co. to realise decent prices.
The past year’s profit was the poorest
since 1909, and still there was a lay-by
equal to 4 p.c. of the capital. But that is
only natural: if you borrow a lot of money
from other people, and invest the whole lot
of it, and take all the risks, you expect to
make a great deal more than you would if
you only put your own money at risk. As
a matter of fact, in this case, seeing that
on capital and reserves combined the profit
was only 6:} p.c., The Bulletin wonders
whether the shareholders were getting any-
thing like a sufficient return for backing
other people’s bills to the extent of £256,7(56.
The explanation may of course be that the
co. takes only such very high-class securities
that the interest all round is very low. If
that isn’t so, then all The Bulletin can
say is that the co. has either got its own
funds badly invested or is taking a lot of
risk with other people’s money for a very
small remuneration. A co. in the mortgage
business which can only earn 6J p.c. on its
capital and reserves, though it has borrowed
more than twice as much from depositors
and risked practically every penny of it, is
prima facie doing so indifferently that it
should ask itself what’s the matter.

The large amount shown as written off in
the last line includes £20,000 reserved last
year “to meet expenditure at Pukeuri,”
where new works have been established, and
£lO,OOO charged this year to Profit and
Loss to pay for “special repairs in progress
and contemplated.” But that isn’t all the
money written off against depreciation ; for
ordinary renewals and replacements are
charged up against the revenue of each
works. The liberal manner in which the
co. has put profit into new plant and then
written it off, ostensibly against the depre-
ciation of older plant, is the most conspicu-
ous feature of the accounts. Seven years
ago the land, buildings and five works, with
the shops and offices in Christchurch, were
valued at £369,699. To-day, though very
many thousands have been spent on the new
works at Pukeuri, the book value is down
to £253,899. In other words, not only
have all the additions and improvements
made during the past seven years been paid
for out of revenue, but £115,800 besides has
been made and written off, avowedly against
depreciation. Put it another way. In
seven years this co. has (1) paid its divi-
dends; (2) paid for new works at Pukeuri
and maintained and improved four other
wor! s ; (3) added £82,720 to its assets other
- than works, etc.; and (4) knocked £98.100 off
its debts, reducing them to £133,290. And
all the new capital that has been got in has
been £4855, bringing the total to £173,254.
It has been a most profitable seven years—
far more profitable than one would judge
from the very modest dividends. And there
is really no reason to expect that the future
will be less profitable. This war will do a
lot of things, and among the things it very
likely will do is to give hundreds of thou-
sands of European men a taste for meat —
just as the taste for meat in Italy has been
spread by the migration of laborers to and
from South America. As for South America,
by the way, the competition from that quar-
ter isn’t the bogey that it was. They dress
their meat better there, without a doubt ;
but the country which can produce the
finest-gi'ade mutton and lamb appears to be
much more limited than was at one time
thought. In fact, it isn’t Argentina proper
but Patagonia, of all places, which seems
to be really the ideal sheep country; and the
opening up of Patagonia is a long way off.

The slump there was not unexpected, on
account of the arrival of a more up-to-date
electric competitor. Rather late in the day
this co. began to buck up a bit. “During
the half-year all street lamps have been
fitted with incandescent burners. ... Consid-
erable additions and renewals have also been
done at the works.” Still, no doubt on
account of the delay, in spite of the expendi-
ture gas sales have not been moving in the
proper direction —£1897 fur the June-Dee.
half of 1914; £1987 for .the second half of
1913. And it wasn’t through tight finances
that the co. was so dilatory:—

There is an improvement since 1908 of
£O4B. Meantime the 5 p.c. has been main-
tained, though not always earned, and there
have been certain additions, with the usual
renewals and repairs. As for the future,
the chairman in a special report to share-
holders says that, on advice, a gas-engine
exhauster and washer are being installed.
"This plant should enable your co. to reduce
the cost of gas to consumers and perhaps
increase the dividend 1 p.c. If the present
management is not able to accomplish this,
then it will be the duty of shareholders to
appoint new directors and management.”
Well, if year after year a gas co. can’t pay
more than 5 p.c., and barely holds its trade
iu spite of growing population, a change
wouldn’t seem to be utterly unreasonable.

But it won’t be all cakes and gingerbeer for
the co. this current year. Last year started
off splendidly, and it was only in the last
months that things eased off. This year,
though the war may not have any serious
direct consequences, the drought will cer-
tainly keep many a Billjim and his missus
from making their annual trip to the city;
prices of provisions are exceptionally
high; and “on Jan. 1 further industrial
legislation involving an increase in wages
came into operation.” Nevertheless, things
are going to be all right presently; for, with
the first good season, prosperity will come
back to the bulk of the people who use this
coffee-palace, the population is steadily grow-
ing, the habit of travelling around is becom-
ing more common, and the number of pubs
is diminishing. The capital of the co. is
nowadays £26,000 in 10s. shares fully paid.
It used to be a lot more, but after the
collapse of the boom the val-ue of the free-
hold was cut down, and capital had to come
off to cqtrespond. Ten years ago the capi-
tal was £20,000, and the liabilities (mostly
mortgage) £22,070. Since then £6OOO of
capital has been got in and £3960 added to
the liabilities; total £9960. To show for
that money the co. has (1) additions to the
freehold made at a cost of £22,741, in-
cluding a four-storey place just completed;
(2) £3835 net added to the book value of
plant and machinery; and (3) £2447 added
to liquid and semi-liquid assets. _ As
the property is most likely worth quite as
much as it was 10 years ago, this. is a
satisfactory record, in view of the dividends
that have been paid during the period.

This was one of the cos. named in the
schedule to the N.S.W. Gas A«t which, in
ordinary circumstances, limits dividends on
old capital to 10 p.c. and on new capital to
7 p.c. There are three lots of shares: “A”
and “B” are entitled to 10 p.c. when there
is the money to pay it; “C” to 7 p.c. Thus
far neither lot are getting their maximum,
so there is something for shareholders to
look forward to. When the standard (10
and 7 p.c. respectively) has been reached a
co. can pay more only after reducing the
price of gas ; and it takes a fourpenny cut to
secure a 1 p.c. increase. The Act also tries
to prevent a co. stuffing away its profit
and pretending to be making only 8 p.c.
when it is really making 15 p.c. Most cos.,
concluding apparently that nothing is to be
gained by hiding anything, now publish very
full accounts: the Newcastle Co. still hands
out only a skeleton. But, anyhow, the cash
position is not improving any faster than
the table above would suggest. Look at

Later on the co. may be piling up cash
profits; so far, though there was a fair
margin beyond the dividends last half-year,
it has been mopping up its liquid assets and
increasing its liabilities to add to its fixed
assets. Doubtless they will earn good
money presently. If they won’t at New-
castle, it is a poor look-out for most other
places in Australia.

But the past half-year’s figures are not as
jubilant as they look. That part of the
country has been having—still is having, in
fact —a bad time, and £3539 was paid to
this co. for shifting live-stock as against
£640 in the previous half-year. The line
serves a droughty district and nothing can
make it otherwise; therefore, though there
will be some subdivision, there will never
be very close settlement, and the co. is conse-
quently never going to be a big, bustling
thing. But its capitalisation is so small
that over a long period of years if will
doubtless continue to do all right in its dull
brown way. This is 10 years’ history in a

Presuming the permanent way and equip-

10 years ago, then, besides paying the divi-
dends. the co. has made £32,717 during that
period. That is, the profit put by has been
equal to about 24d. p.c. p.a. of the present
capital. The solid performance of a respect-

They haven’t had to wait long; in fact,
they might reasonably have been asked to
wait longer. That is one of the features of
a trustee co.; no matter how good its pros-
pects it can’t expect its best friends to make
it their executor and then die straight off
just to give the office a chance to earn com-
mission. Even now the co. can’t be earning
much; but it has paid off its preliminary
exes., and has all its capital now represented
by public securities (£10,210) and mort-
gages (£1885) ; and in view of the nature
of the assets a large reserve isn’t urgent. In
the circs, the payment of a 3 p.c. div. can’t
be much cavilled at. But the pace mustn’t
be forced; in the natural order of things
there can’t be any very substantial increase
of profits for several years, and while a busi-
ness is incubating shareholders ought to be
satisfied with even a shade less than they
would get if they had put their money
directly instead of indirectly into Govern-
ment bonds.

There is war in Sydney, too. The retire-
ment of Bruce Smith (who doesn’t count)
and ,T. B. Nicholson (who does) from the
Board of Sydney Hydraulic has been fol-
lowed by an open declaration of hostilities
on the part of Standard-Waygood, of which
Mr. Nicholson is managing-director. While
circulars are flying to. and fro among share-
holders the voices of otherwise sensible people
who want the amalgamation which should
have been effected long ago are heard saying
that the two are not really competitors.
“It is not true that the Standard-Waygood
is a competitor,” says one circular. “The
Hydraulic Co.’s business consists in provid-
ing hydraulic power for the working of lifts.
Standard-Waygood does not supply power of
any description. Its business is to instal,
maintain and repair lifts whether worked by
electric power or hydraulic power.” This is
specious. The two perhaps needn’t necessarily
be competitors, but they are, and always
have been. If they weren’t competitors this
row wouldn’t matter much to Sydney
Hydraulic. As they are competitors, Syd-
ney Hydraulic will find Standard-Waygood
busy persuading people to substitute electric
lifts for hydraulic. Once the electric lift
goes in the Hydraulic Co. loses its revenue,
all future revenue being then cut up between
Standard-Waygood for repairs and mainten-
ance, and the City Council for power supply.
It is nonsense to tell Hydraulic shareholders
that Standard-Waygood isn’t a competitor.
It is so serious a competitor that, both by
reason of the character of its business and
the excellent quality of its management, it
lias already made a mess of the Hydraulic,
and threatens to make a still worse one.
But. though Standard-Waygood, with
cheap electric power behind it, will
mostly win, it would probably win
more by amalgamation. The fight is
going to cost money, and the two cos.
had much better whack the business and keep
the cost of competition in their pocket. That
is, looking at it from the point of view of
the shareholders. What the basis of amal-
gamation should be doesn’t so much concern
us. But the simplest way is the best way ;
and the simplest way will be to accept on
both sides the market values of the two
stocks as at (say) February I—before, that
is, the present row in the Hydraulic camp
bit the top off the market for that stock.
Great Cobar prepares for a new start,
under not very favorable auspices. In six
years to the end of 1913 the mine produced
38.552 tons of copper, 151,5110 z. gold and
667,3000 z. silver, worth more than
£3,000,000. A solitary dividend (155.) was
paid in 1907; for the rest, shareholders have
had to be satisfied with nicely worded reports.
But the end had to come, because, although
gross profits were substantial, there was a
drain for debenture interest, and heavy ad-
ministration and other charges. Most of
the time Great Cobar claimed an extraction
of about 2 p.c. copper. With the metal at
£5O that is only 20s. per ton of crude ore;
so profits depended on high prices or very
low costs. Costs were said officially to be
the lowest in Australia, but they were care-
fully calculated at per ton of crude ore, and
never upon blister. The man who figures
his costs per ton of quartz and forgets to
mention that the cost of an ounce of gold
is £5 is deluding you, but it takes time to
find him out. In the future Great Cobar
may not be able to show that its costs are
“the lowest in Australia,” but it hopes to
produce blister copper at a profit, which is
far more important.
George Blakemore further on the N.S.W.
Mining law: —
If the abolition of the speculator is the only
argument in favor of the labor conditions clamre,
then it is not a sound argument. There is no neces-
sity for any speculator to fulfil any labor conditions,
the Mining Act notwithstanding. After grabbing
the thousand acres, most of which, in the west, is in
the possession of Brother Rabbit, and at best is
rented per annum at one-twentieth of one penny per
acre, the speculator, with, the assistance of the Mining
Act, finds the dodging of labor conditions a simple
matter. The leases he applies for may not be issued
by the Mines Department for a period of three to
six months; there is usually a month allowed after
that to execute the lease, andi then in the majority
of cases a period of two to six months can be
depended on before any secret report is made to the
Crown about the non-fulfilment of labor conditions.
Then he is allowed a month to show cause. The
speculator usually adopts a slightly different proce-
dure. Shortly after the leases are executed one of
his partners reports the leases for non-fulfilment. The
name is never made public owing to the
unhealthy State policy of encouraging secret report-
ing, and in that sense the Mining Act is made use
of. In due course, perhaps two months, the leases
are cancelled; but the honest partner, as a reward
from the Government, gets beforehand notice, and at
the proper time he re-pegs and applies for the leases.
The same solemn delay of months occurs in the
issuance and execution of the new leases to the new
applicant. Within a few weeks of the new leases
being issued the original speculator or another
friend secretly reports the second crop of leases, and
in due time they are again solemnly cancelled, and
the usual beforehand notice being given, the leases
are re-pegged once again. So the merry game can
go on, and does go on, as long as the crowd sticks
to one another. No labor conditions have been
observed by any of the owners, but the law is satis-
fied, and so are the speculators. The very law which
aims at suppressing the speculator assists him in
avoiding the labor conditions. Meantime the genuine
miner, on whom the speculator is depending to make
money, is the only sufferer.

A copper show between Oberon and Wise-
man’s Creek (N.S.W.) is under option to a
Melbourne crowd. The mine has been
worked for many years by P. Foran in a
casual way, the better ore being bagged and
sent to the smelters; and it has kept the
owner in more than a crust, though it has
been merely pig-rooted and provided with
practically no plant at all. Low-grade stuff’
has so far been severely left alone, though
it is claimed that there is a good deal of it
in sight.

Magnus has resigned the tough job of
managing Mount Morgan. It isn’t' unex-
pected. Things haven’t gone well during
his reign. He may have been a good-enough
technical man, but for one thing he didn't
know the Australian working-man and he
wouldn’t learn him. Moreover, he got the
staff sizzling, and lost the services of the
men he most badly needed. Presumably
A. A. Boyd will carry on. He isn’t a metal-
lurgist : but he knows what to do when he
has got hold of a metallurgist. No man can
personally be everything.
*•*■*■*
The Randalls field (W.A.) continues to
fulfil this paper's expectations. One of its
delusions —-the Hardcastle —was sold the
other day, and others are in trouble. There
is some talk of fresh capital being raised
for the Hardcastle; but the game isn’t
worth the candle.
Associated Northern (W.A.) last year
made a working profit of £9245. Adminis-
tration exes, and sundry charges reduced
this to £9727. There was £23,867 brought
forward; total I*. and L. credit, £27,654.
Of this £23,957 has been written off against
mine development, shaft sinking, deprecia-
tion, etc., leaving £3697 to carry forward.
The manager regrets his inability, on
account of the nature of the ore body, to
estimate reserves in the Victorious mine,
but ventures the opinion that there is enough
ore in sight “to keep the mill fully em-
ployed for several months.” Conditions
are so disturbed in Mexico that nothing has
been done with the co.’s somewhat doubtful
venture in that country; but the Board be-
lieves it is still in the same place, and has
not been molested.
* * * *
Golden Ridge (W.A.) is about to give in.
Recent operations have only just about paid
working exes., and the £5OO profit shown
each month has, the co. naively remarks,
been taken from reserves. A few months
will see the end.
* * * *
Lake View and Oroya lias treated the last
of the accumulated tailings on the Lake
View Consols (W.A.) and cleared out.
From May, 1908, to April, 1910, the old
Lake View Co. filter-pressed 230,000 tons
and made a profit of £34,500. Then it sold
out to the Lake View and Oroya, and this
co. has since put through about 615.000
tons for a profit of £22,000.
Hopes of resurrection for Chaffers (W.A.)
are fairly bright. A meeting of creditors
has accepted the co.’s proposal that they
take debentures in settlement of their
accounts, subject to a further £20.000 of
working capital being found. Frenzied
efforts are being made to raise this sum, and
meantime the petition presented by Perth
creditors to wind up the concern is sus-
pended.
* * * *
Great Boulder (W.A.) has just compiled
another annual estimate of what is in sight.
This time it reckons it has 627,925 tons of
ore in reserve worth 565. 9d., or 61,000 tons
less and Is. 6d. per ton higher grade than it
had 12 months ago. As about 240.000 tons
are treated annually, this estimate puts the
mine about three years ahead of the mill.
No sinking has been done during the past
three years, and as the mill has only gained
on the mine to the extent of about two
months’ supplies in that time, local'optimists
figure out that the show is good for another
12 years at least. But this , basis of calcula-
tion is wrong. The mine is done for at
depth; but by connecting up a number of
the deep levels and including large blocks
of ore in the reserves which could not with
safety previously be taken into account,
the present estimates have been swollen
and the real position masked. This rein-
forcing cannot last much longer, and soon
the time will come when the mill will
encroach more rapidly on the reserves, and
the mine, great as it has been, will fade.
* * * *
Speakman’s, registered in August, 1914. to
take over a section of the Hampton Plains
Estate (W.A.), has had its first crushing,
and now the mostly-Victorian shareholders
are feeling as bitter and cynical as Timon
of Athens. The long-expected crushing of
596 tons of ore yielded 38oz. bullion, or
I.27dwt. per ton. Sands assay 2dwt. and
slimes another Idwt. The dirt looks like
sdwt. all round, and there doesn’t seem to
be any very violent necessity for Melbourne
to go as far afield as W.A. to dig up sdwt,
ore.
The Coronet Hill (N.T.) copper show
stands where it did, the water from the lode
—allegedly there are two or three miles of
lode —being too much for the present pump-
ing equipment. Prospects are encouraging,
with good secondary enrichments, the depth
whereof no man knoweth. The next instal-
ment of the Federal Government’s promised
£5OOO should be spent in sinking a shaft
below the tunnel level (273 ft.). after the
water question has been satisfactorily
settled.
* * * *
The Scarsdale mine, named after the dis-
trict that bore the .Jubilee and a few other
decent dividend-paying concerns, has been
going the way of Ballarat. During last
half-year it got what the manager in a spirit
of optimism calls “fairly satisfactory” re-
sults. The cold facts are that in a rise
from the 200 ft. level the lode “at times” was
payable, that 217 tons blasted out at the
27oft. level went under sdwt. per ton. and
that at 3 1 nft. the stone became as patchy as
a fossicker’s pants. What 475 ft. will evolve
remains to be seen. The financial result of
all these “fairly satisfactory things is that
the co. closed the half-year owing a bit to
the bank, unpaid calls are an item, and the
battery still has to be settled for. On de-
velopments. the right plan was to open up
the 475 ft. level before bothering the
machinery merchant over a battery. Now.
unless the pick reveals a lot more than the
Scarsdale has developed so "far, the machinery
man is likely to get his own back.
A neglected reserve of the waning gold-
mining industry in Victoria is being tapped
already to some slight extent, and will pro-
bably be much more drawn on in the future
In many cases, on the flour-gold leads of
Victoria, large portions just "unpayable in
the days when only the coarser gold was saved
were left by old-time parties and cos. In
most cases on these flour-gold propositions
the coarser gold only was saved bv the white
men. the right to retreat the puddler “slum”
being sold to Chinese, who in many cases
made big money putting the material care-
fully and laboriously over “quicksilver
cradles.” These curiously misnamed appli-
ances were really huge cradles on
which the fine gold was concentrated
on canvas-covered slides, the yield being
afterwards boiled with mercury to
amalgamate the gold. One mine at
Timor, near Maryborough, got £5OOO a year
from the Celestials in return for the privilege
of cradling its slime. Then the cyanide
process came along, and again re-treated the
Chows’ residues, in which in most cases not
a color could be obtained in the dish. In
many cases small parties are now doing well
by exploiting these abandoned blocks on the
old leads, puddling the coarse gold out, and
cyaniding the slime, and it is an industry
that will stand a lot of expansion. After all
the pld-time treatment, many slime heaps
yielded 10s. or 12s. a ton to the cyanide pro-
cess, so there is considerable room for line-
gold values between the coarse gold to be ob-
tained by puddling and the total assay value
of the wash. It was in just such a quiet,
unassuming way that the cyaniding of
alluvial “slum” started in Victoria 10 years
or so ago, and the pioneers of the industry
were looked upon as amiable lunatics who
were putting in a lot of hard work for very
little remuneration. Then it dawned on the big-
men that they were the lunatics, and the
country bristled with blue pegs and plants
arose in the night, and Maryborough, the
centre of the flour-gold system, boomed as il
hadn’t done since the alluvial business died
out.

A
WOMAN'S
LETTER
Sydney, March 22, 1915.
My Dear Arini, —
G.-G. Munro Ferguson, who is hard
pressed for a place to lay his kilts when he
comes to Sydney, will shelter at Yaralla for
the Easter festivities —such as they are.
This time Miss Eadith Walker will be host-
ess instead of landlady.
One of the items at Randwiek this Easter
will be six feet of Indian Rajah. An infor-
mative friend says that, like all Oriental
greatnesses, the Puducota potentate looks
much more impressive in his native finery
than in the European sac-suit of everyday
wear.
Dr. Haber, the German Governor whom
the Australians shook out of his palm-tops
at Rabaul has been making return for the
misplaced generosity with which he was
treated at ilerbertshohe, and the still more
misplaced hospitalities he received in our
second best suburbs, by telling pretty tales
aboiV us to Uncle Sam. Or if he didn’t
tell the tales Uncle Sam’s reporters have
been doing it for him. “Bluffed” is the big
heading the New York Times gives to the
column-long story it credits him with. Our
“comic-opera army,” 1800 strong, was, he
says, landed to capture about half a dozen
people; and for 10 days he haggled with
them and bluffed them, in the hope that
German warships would turn up and teach
the principals and chorus the goose-step.
Even when they didn’t turn up—being too
dreadfully busy getting out of the way; but
he doesn’t mention that- -he still bluffed,
and, pretending he had millions of man-
eaters in leash, extracted such delirious
terms that, when they found he had only
two men and a boy, or thereabouts, the
comic-opera army wanted to repeat history
and tear up the scrap of paper.
It makes a pretty story, and it’s true
enough as part of the German-lie campaign.
All that is very wrong about it is that the
Australians knew to an animal how many
Germans there were in those parts, and in-
stead of sending 1300 men ashore, landed a
mere 50. In that 50 was included Dr.
Pockley. of the Red Cross, and they killed
him. Of course they say they didn’t know
he was a surgeon and a non-combatant; but
there was ambulance-man Wray, wearing
the Red Cross, and they not only fired at
him but riddled his Red Cross flag. That
would make a pretty supplement to Dr.
Haber's first short story
At St. Pat’s concert in the Town Hall, on
March 17. some dressy ecclesiastic millinery
billowed round the sub-regal chairs. In the
centre were Governor Strickland and daugh-
ter Mary, with Papal Legate Cerretti’s
voluminous rose drapery on one side, and
Archbishop Kelly’s purple frocking on the
other. The hall was packed to its last plank
long before the performers, who were mostly
juvenile, began to make their noises. The
small damsels from Monte St. Angelo Col-
lege (North Sydney) gave a particularly
tuneful account of themselves. SIJ Mac-
donald. warbled a new lay by Molli? C.
•Tones—“ List Ye All ’Tis Ireland Singing”
to loud applause. Bryce Carter, Ella Jas-
pers, Daisy Thomas and scores of young
persons in short white frocks and very large
hair-bows were to the fore in a programme
of considerable mileage.
Judge Backhouse took the best chair at
the monthly meeting of the Dickens Fellow-
ship. After detailing other events, his Honor
with a soft smile alluded to a March picnic,
at which he and 28 other Fellows had greatly
enjoyed themselves. He hinted that the 30ih
Fellow, who had wavered and fallen out of
the ranks at the station —owing to the heat.—
would, if he knew anything about it, be very
sorry yet. The 30th Fellow, who looked
like Tom Pinch after a prolonged course of
beefsteak puddings, said nothing in the
mildest manner. Of the scenes from Dickens
given at this gathering, the best concerned
Mr. Bumble and the widow Corney. But
the most entertaining part of the evening
was the audience. Dickens characters in
the flesh were everywhere, and Mr. F.’s
aunt, smiling over her fan when a fine
understudy of Mr. Dick came her way,
brought in a fragrant memory of mid-Vic-
torian days.
Two Australian pilgrims who arrived in
’Frisco a while ago record their sentiments
on the advance of Style in that lively town.
“Skirts 10 inches off the ground, and about
five yards round! Many of them were wired
to make them stand out from the silk
bloomers underneath. These were rather
longer than the balloon that wobbled above
them, and came just to the edges of the soft
kid hoots, with ruffled-looking Cossack tops.
We stepped ashore in the lean, bolster gar-
ments of 1914, and felt about 2000 b.c.”
The “very cutest” hairdressing in New
York, according to Mrs. Freddie Shipman, is
the "bob.” The hair is cut off at the back of
the neck (woman is a sacrificial lamb when
she does her worst to her appearance) and
is rolled under. This done, the victim binds
her head with a fillet of silk or anything she
can find in the top drawer. One end of this
garniture dangles over the right _ ear, and
ends for choice in a large and scintillating
bauble.
Mrs. Freddie herself is given to wearing
the new coat-costumes since she stepped off
the Sonoma. These save-time creations are
just beginning to burst on our local autumn
Fashion gambols. They are made in one
piece, and look as if they take some cutting.
The back is like a long-tailed coat, and the
fore part is the rich relation of a mere robe.
Commander Foyer, the new Governor of
the Star-and-Striped part of Samoa, landed
there the other day with his wife and other
baggage. The lady was so pleased to find
the kettle boiling in the official bungalow
that she started housekeeping before remov-
ing her second-best hat. In the luncheon
party were fellow passengers by the Sonoma
—the Robert Harpers, of Melbourne, and a
new U.S. Consul bound for Newcastle. He
is Lucien Sullivan, and he used to be a pro-
fessor of something at Lehigh ’Varsity,
Pennsylvania.
At a farewell spread to Justice Barton in
the Athenaeum Club, the after-dinner event
was some determined bushranging in aid of
the Belgian Fund. Mr. Gorman put a
soldier’s decorative silk handkerchief, with
bunting and other patriotic devices, up for
sale. About 50 members of the club made
lusty bids for the article, which was sold
and resold till the total was about £6OO.
This sum had another £lOO tacked on to it
next day, by members who hadn’t been
present at the Barton evening. The hankie
is now a wall decoration in the Castlereagh-
street club, and the £7OO is safely in the
battered Belgian hat.
The Stock Exchange men rescued another
of their younger members from the bulls
and bears last week and handed him
over to the safe custody of a wife. The
nfter-performance took place at big John
Ferguson’s church in Phillip-street, where
Frank Tilley promised to henceforth
share his 1 per cent, commission with
May Perdriau. The Burwood boy and the
Drummoyne girl afterwards shook hands
with everybody at Petty’s Hotel, and left
next day by the Mongolia for Hobart.
Ola Jane Humphrey, when last seen by
Australians, was in Los Angeles (Cal.).
There is a whole moving-picture city there,
with everything, including a zoo, that the
flicker artists are likely to want. Even the
houses fall to bits if they are asked to, and
a back yard can be turned into an orna-
mental lake or a harem or any other old
thing the picture play may want space
for. A scenario called “Under the Cres-
cent” has been specially written for _ Ola
Jane, who will, of course, be the injured
heroine of it. The spoiling of the Egyptian
has nothing to do with the plot. Ola still
has a very live press-agent: you can tell
that by the fact that she is guarded by
a tame police escort. You see. she is sup-
posed to know too many Turkish secrets to
be allowed at liberty by the personages
who recently threw their fez into the melt-
ing pot. When the escort raps at Ola Jane’s
door in the morning, he announces in a
loud voice: “Princess, I am here to attend
you !”—in order, no doubt, that no one may
mistake him for a mere union milkman.
Mild murmurings from the prospective
debutante break the click of knitting needles
in our best suburbs. “No dancing men this
season,” sighs the Girl. As dances are
likely to be few, this doesn’t hit the debu-
tante quite so hard as the fact that only
grandpa and some elderly waiters are likely
to see her new ball gown. For Easter and
later this garment is to measure about five
yards round the hem. In six months it
may take up all the space in the taxi. If
skirts go on growing by the yard, Heaven
knows how much drawing-room sofa will
be left for the returned warriors when the
war is over. Still, I daresay they won’t
mind feeling rather crowded.
Mrs. Charles Barlow, who used to be one
of the upstanding Dight girls of this State,
married the present Admiral Barlow when
he was skipper of the Royal Arthur. She is
in London now, waiting to see what’s going
to happen in the North Sea. where her eldest
boy is treading after his father’s sea-boots
as a junior officer.
One of our best-looking young matrons,
Mrs. Walter Marks, is settling down in
Manchester Square, London, to watch for
hubby’s safe return. Walter Marks is a
Sydney yachting enthusiast, who started
Dressing his services on the rulers of the
King’s Navy at the beginning of the trouble.
Now he is a lieutenant in the. Naval Volun-
teer Reserve, and his beat is—but that.s
where the Censor will reach out for bis
blue-nosed sword.
Australians are rushing the flying corps
in England. The queue is so extensive that
a Gundagai man, Ernest Bruce, who tried
to join, found that his application was
likely to be shelved for months. lie is
struggling now for a show in the Royal
Engineers.
Donald Mcßeath, the youthful Sydney
fiddler, is getting good notices from the
U.S. press. Pie is with John McCormack
on a tour that is raking up such a harvest
ot dollars that you’d never guess there was
a war-blight ravaging the crop in some
places.
A Sydney nurse sends a line from Egypt.
“When we go off duty we sometimes bump
over the adjacent sand on camels. The
other day we went to an Indian hospital
for the wounded at San Stefano. It has over
a thousand beds, Indian and British doctors
and colored orderlies who are practically
wardsmaids The Arabs run numbers of
little tea places with Australian names, and
the Cooee Cafe is a prevailing fashion.
Egyptian money is hard to understand, but
we are beginning to know how many things
a piastre won’t buy.”
A long partnership, which was sometimes
a rivalry, was broken a day or two ago when
Dr. Norman Gregg and Dr. Eric Barbour
left Sydney Uni. to go, one to the Front, the
other to a hospital surgeon’s post in Queens-
land. They played cricket together in a
backyard in Burwood; at Sydney Grammar
School they jostled one another for best
examination passes in their years and high-
est cricket scores. They were both scarcely
out of knickerbockers when they played in
inter-State matches. When they went to-
gether to the Uni., since one took Medicine
of course the other had to ; and when Bar-
bour wasn’t president or secretary of the
Undergrads’ Assoc., it was 'Gregg’s turn to
lead. Since both couldn’t take the Rhodes
Scholarship in the one year, the undergrads
always wondered which of the two it would
be. Then there was an outbreak of insanity
at Potsdam, and Gregg is one of 20-odd
young graduates from the Sydney Medical
School who have been throwing their kits
together, and start off this week on a dash
for France. Barbour, son of an old Gram-
mar School master, now teaching the young
idea at Toowoomba, decided to mend the
sick who stay at home, for the present any-
way.
Barrister Bert Norris goes to the Front
as major of a N.S.W. infantry regiment.
As a preliminary he leads Bessie Lane
Mullins to the altar on March 25. Many
bridesmaids, garbed In blush pink, sur-
mounted by black velvet millinery, will
pace up the aisle behind the bridal train. The
groom’s pretty sister Etta, the bride’s sister
and other damsels are in the pageant. Miss
Bessie will murmur “I will” under the veil
her mother wore.
Dr. Agnes Bennett, who has been very
popular in Wellington (M.L.), has offered
her services to the British Red Cross. She
belongs to this part of the world and is likely
to look in at Neutral Bay to kiss mother
goodbye on her way to the big operating
theatre.
Mrs. Henry Dobson, the Tasmanian
political lady with an important Presence,
has just come back from England ; and Miss
Rose Scott has invited ladies of sound views
about Votes for Women to shake the wan-
derer’s hand this week at Beaumann’s Cafe.
The Artists’ Tableaux for the War Fund
are booked for April 14 in the Repertory
Theatre. Scenic artist Alt' Clint is paint-
ing the background for the big bones of the
show, “The Awakening of Australia.”
The silvery-topped tenor Dufault is tour-
ing the U.S.A. with the entertainment end of
the Lafayette Society. Funds for the French
Red Cross are the object of this attack on
Dollars. By one of those coincidences which
frequently force together performers who
hate each other, Roma.vne Simmons has been
engaged as accompanist.
Pretty Mrs. Roderick Cameron, who is a
daughter of the Charlie Lindemans, is back
in Sydney. Her husband died in New
York after a year or two of wedded bliss.
What out-of-the-way billets the artistic
fraternity are beating up nowadays! There’s
Fairlie Cunninghame, a young Sydney
Sculptress—she has been for some years
in London —who is now looking after the
commissariat department at a South of Eng-
land Red Cross hospital. I hear she
examines the invalids’ cookery and sees that
the mutton broth doesn’t boil over as
though she had never done anything else in
her life.
One of the cleverest illusions in Annette
Kellerman’s aquatic sports as “Neptune’s
Daughter”—now showing at the Palace
Theatre—is her swift transformation from
a mermaid to a girl. After being seasonably
clad as a lady-fish with a tail, Annette is
tossing a mane of hair and counting her 10
toes before you have time to see where her
scaley terminus went to. The local artist
sighs for such a model as the Kellerman
fieure, wonderfully noised in classic grace.
King Neptune has the softest billet in the
show. He doesn’t chansre his bathing-trunks
once in seven nets, and seems to go to
bed in his waterproof crown.
“Bunty,” who pulled the strings in Mof-
fatt’s play, is now Mrs. Geoffrey ElMngton,
of Maoriland. So the author, having lost
Ella Young, will have to adjust his spec-
tacles and set out on the long search for as
charming a successor.
Mrs. Alan Carroll, widow of the doctor
who did so much to save the puny young-
sters in this city, is at present in London.
She is mothering a Sydney girl with a
voice, which is going through the usual
gymnastics.
Chief Justice Cullen’s two sons have
either gone or leave shortly for the long,
long Front.
A Sydney man who looked over the edge
of the new View at Blacliheath says it is
one of the most comprehensive of its kind on
the Mountains. It is about five miles from
the village, and you get there with a fairly
whole skin over a road the local people
hurriedly dug out in three weeks. Then they
had a view day, and asked some of the shire
councillors to go over the bumps. Nobody
took any broken bones away. The spot is
likely to be called Hargreave’s Lookout, after
the man who found the view 34 years ago.
Dr. Barnett, one of Dunedin’s chief stetho-
scopes, recently passed this way en route for
Red Cross work in France.
Going to Kosciusko for Easter are Mr. and
Mrs. H. Austin —he buys wool by the ton or
so, Mr. Foster Hall, Percy Utz and a couple
of sisters. John Dibble and party are also
booked for the same frosty address.
There is a delicious outbreak of nagging
among the Liberal women. Mrs. Laura
Luffman, for instance, writes to contradict
what she describes as “inadvertence” on the
part of Mrs. Yeo. The latter daringly
alluded to the “futile efforts” of the Women's
Liberal Club, which drinks its tea in the
Queen Victoria Club. You can almost smell
the fat burning this end of George-street.
Saturday, March 27, is the date of a big
garden ffite at Turramurra, to help keep
the Belgian pot boiling Mrs. J. R. Wood—
the Newcastle lady who used to be Essie
Jenyns—r-is helping a determined committee
to rake in the cash. In the afternoon there
will be a youngsters’ show, and the evening
air will resound with the wails of fiddles arid
the groans of ’cellos. Elocutionist Ber-
tram Flohrn is in charge of the programme.
Fishermen will whip the lake in the Hotel
Kosciusko grounds on March 31, and the
man who lands the record trout will gel.
away with the prize. The referee, Gritchley
Parker, produced a fighting nine-pounder
from this water a few weeks ago. The battle
raged for about three-quarters of an hour.
A cast of the body is on view at Challis
House. The pool has been closely protected
for the last five or six years; now the authori-
ties propose to give the anglers a treat.
Mrs. Paterson (artist Mildred Lovett)
has packed up her color box and gone to
Brisbane. Hubby has a new billet there.
So the nest at Manly, which was chiefly
studio, houses them no more.
An Australian girl named Kathleen Pear-
son, who has "been interned in Germany
since the outbreak of the war. had the luck
to get away the other day. The useful Dr.
Carroll, who represents the Commonwealth
in Switzerland, secured the girl’s release,
but her brother Vincent is to be kept under
the eye of Wilhelm’s officials till peace is in
sight.
There is more sadness than ever in the
sad face of Dr. Fourness Barrington. He
had one son —a young man who was doing
brilliantly at Oxford and Paris. When
the great trouble started, he was early for-
ward, and won a commission in an Irish
regiment. To-day there is no son, no bril-
liant future —only a memory of duty done.
The long period of probation and training
required of a woman desirous of becoming, a
minist’ring angel (uniform and board and
lodging provided) will have to be extended
if some of the country hospitals have their
way. The latest illustration comes from
Dubbo, which called for applications for a
matron at less than £2 a week. “Knowledge
of dispensing essential.” Four years’ train-
ing in medical and surgical nursing and 12
months in midwifery have to be endured, and
several examinations have to be passed, before
a nurse is eligible as matron; and if she
has to become a dispensing chemist as well,
the game scarcely seems worth while. This
sweating of nurses and qualified pharmacists
wants stamping on with elephants’ feet.
Pianist Laurence Godfrey Smith is leav-
ing in the Malwa. He gives a farewell con-
cert here on March 31, and dashes for the
mailboat at Adelaide. He has caught the
war germ, and means to offer his services
in any capacity. With a fluent knowledge
of French and German —he was five years
in Vienna —he’ll have a good show in the
Intelligence Corps as interpreter. But he’ll
enlist in King Edward’s Horse —he’s a rider
in his hours of exercise—or any other fight-
ing force, rather than keep out of the row.
Yours affectionately,
VANDORIAN.

Just to touch the
Glorious Broadwood
vcx
seems the crystallisation of Beethoven’s
thought, that “music is the mediator between
the spiritual and sensual life.”
The golden-stringed “Broadwood” gently
draws a veil between us and the things that
trouble, and its fine tones are as far removed
as the Poles from the jangling, mechanical
sounds of wood and wire that come from
instruments which are—to use a trite expres-
sion—“just thrown .together.”
Broadwood Pianos are British-built
They are typically British from castor to lid, and a standing
tribute to thorough and skilful Piano construction. So nearly
perfect are these all-“ British” Pianos that their manufacture has
gone on uninterruptedly for every business day of 200 years.
Calls for “Broadwoods” come from the four corners of the
globe. Have YOU heard the music they give? You can OWN
one TO-DAY. Come and hear them played; play one yourself,
you will be surprised and delighted. Terms of payment will be
made agreeable to you. Interesting Literature free.

HOW TO CORRECT FAULTY
DIGESTION.
Faulty digestion, flatulence, indigestion—
and, in fact, most forms of stomach trouble
—are almost invariably due to acidity and
food fermentation. Drugs and medicines
are useless in these cases because they act
only on the stomach and do not affect the
cause of the trouble —the acidity and fer-
menting food. To instantly neutralise the
acid and stop fermentation, physicians and
specialists usually prescribe half a tea-
spoonful of bisurated magnesia, obtainable
of all chemists and dispensaries, in a little
water immediately after meals or whenever
pain is felt. Since the discovery by an
eminent specialist of this remarkable pro-
perty of bisurated magnesia, it has been
generally adopted as the standard antacid
and food corrective in many hospitals and
by many of the most prominent medical men
of the day. Dyspeptics should always keep
bisurated magnesia handy, as its use invari-
ably insures painless, normal digestion. v
MELBOURNE CHATTER
Melbourne, March 22, 1915.
My Dear Yarrie, —
Clarence Weber —the man who continu-
ally refutes Scripture by adding inches to
people’s stature —gave a big show in the
Auditorium on Thursday night. Black vel-
vet curtains for a background, and a spot-
light in intense darkness, made the exhibiting
pupils look like figures from a seance. The
men, appearing singly on a pedestal, were
introduced by the voice of Clarence crying-
in the dark. They produced a boa-con-
strictor-like effect by the weird play of their
muscles; in fact, one very blonde, pink
creature nearly sent the women into hys-
terics by his uncanny shudders and twitches.
Clarence was as lovely as ever. lie first
gave a lecture in his evening clothes, and
then cast them off: and appeared in a
leopard skin. Bonnie Murray was another
beautiful apparition, in white silk circus
tights, and as much else as she thought the
case demanded.
But the interesting feature was provided
by the six wrestling Amazons, who wore
brown and had their hair tied up in brown
l urbans. They have been taught the way
to deal with the Insulting Hound who tries
to flirt with them. After having watched
them I can only say, my dear, that I. pity
that libertine. It appears that the way to
handle a man who puts his arm round your
waist is to administer a brisk push to his
face. He either has to abandon the Marcus
Superbus business or have his neck broken.
The girls demonstrated the way to do it.
Guffaws arose from the stalled youths. Clar-
ence invited any one of them to step up and
be experimented on ; and then, behold, there
was a dead silence, Another dainty trick is
to throw the licentious one with a shin kick,
and then grip him round the neck with your
leg. The pose is hardly ladylike, but the
shock of the proceeding is said to be enough
to turn a Heliogabalus into a St. Anthony.
There are also some arm-twists calculated
to make the Villain let go with a
howl. And, finally, an exercise which
struck me as the most effective of
lhe lot. It consisted simply in stamping
hard with the heel on the most vulnerable
part of the Scoundrel’s instep. The mock-
males who were experimented on simply
squealed for mercy when this was done to
them with gymnasium footwear. A high-
heeled shoe would make the remedy doubly
certain. An elevating as well as an amusing-
entertainment, on the whole.
Esther Paterson wants me to remind you
that her show will be on at the Besant Hall
by the time The Bulletin next blooms;
and as she is young and Huffily pretty it’s a
pleasure.
Nicholas Joy, who was lately responsible
for the rather naughty “.Affairs of Anatole”
at the Austral Salon, has arranged a one-
night show of “The Importance of Being
Earnest” for the Athenaeum Hall. It is to
happen on Saturday, and the proceeds will be
“partly devoted” to the Belgian Fund. Some
bright amateurs—Maud Jolliffe, H. W.
Greenwood and others —will support Nicholas
on the joyful occasion, and Rose Seaton has
been specially engaged.
The Austral Salon has got out its annual
report. Stupendous! Patriotic movements,
parties, lectures and Heaven knows what else
have been provided for the benefit of mem-
bers and the nation. But all is not undiluted
bliss. Asa matter of fact, the owner of
the rooms, who had promised before the War
to rebuild and alter and redecorate them, has
reneged. As far as the Kaiser is concerned
it is the last straw. There will be no party
for him at the Austral Salon now, not if he
waits 50 years before visiting Melbourne.
Hurled back on their own resources the
worried ladies are doing the best they can
; with a vacuum-cleaner and some new
draperies.
Lady Helen and her shrunken house-party
turned up at the Auditorium Physical Cul-
ture display on Friday. She wore a wreath
—I mean a fence —of diamonds in her hair,
and the Mayoress, alongside, was im-
posing in cut coral. The Forrest noble-
woman, in pale green, chaperoned a girl
party. Most of the medical men .who. are
not at the war were there with their wives,
it being the sort of show to which you take
your wife or no one. The sweets’ sellers,
headed by Vanda Clarke, beat the Kultur
maidens at figure showing. Or it may
merely have been that they were better
dressed. Each of them wore six inches of
jewelled tulle from the waist up, and a flimsy
split skirt below. Vanda herself affected
ninon, the color of the heart of a rock-melon,
and looked as pink as if she had been surfing
on a cold day. The Kultur girls were econo-
mically garbed in neck-to-knee costumes and
white' silk tights. And very, very taking
they looked too. Bunches of young men,
who were huddled together in the audience
for mutual protection, expressed their admi-
ration in no stinted fashion. The girls
posed in pink and amber limelight against
crimson curtains. The one that chiefly
attracted my notice was a well-developed
high-kicker in the very back row. Her con-
spicuous limb always appeared on high
against the crimson background and well
over the heads of the acrobatic front line.
The fencing girls wore black silk and
Toreador red sashes with red harness on
their black masks. They made me feel
quite creepy —the sort of feeling you get in
a dark street in old Granada or Seville —till
I looked round and noticed the policemen
and the attendants and the suburbanites
with their “clouds” and goloshes, and real-
ised that I was safe at home, after all.
The Wax Pageant was repeated, and as I
warned you last week, Florrie Finn ex-
pounded the picture story by the aid of a
series of original verses. If I wasn’t afraid
of encouraging an evil, habit I would say
that her poem ' was “highly acceptable” or
“instinct with grace and beauty.” As it is
I merely give the work mention and pass
reticently on. By the way, a whole school
of girls had been brought to this show.
There they sat in most effective uniforms —
Dutch blue pinafore dresses over white
blouses, and surmounted by red hair ribbons
—and gushed till I thought something would
surely burst.
The “Millicent” fete came off last week.
The Curries bought the. old place from the
Cummings (who built it) about. 14 years
ago, and the Archie Curries are living there
now. (Archibald, you know, inherited some
£70.000 just, lately.) Mrs. Archie was one
of the Gibson sisters (no relation to the
“Gibson Girls”), and another Gibson sister,
Mrs. Ernest Keep, helped strenuously with
this fete. There were goat-carriages and
donkeys and fortune tellers and a Punch and
Judy show, so you see all varieties of intel-
lect were catered for.
George Fairbairn opened the show, and
Alison Fairbairn-Balmain acted as sales-
woman. A large contingent of Symes
assisted, and Mrs. George Dickson had the
beautiful Viola with her. A Bulletin
caricature of Lord Dicky Nevill by “Boz”
was auctioned at the Art Stall. Among
the bidders were some who would willingly
have laid their fortunes at the feet bf the
absent Richard. At least. I think they
would. One can only conjecture in these
affairs. People are so absurdly reticent on
matters of the heart.
Heather Keep marshalled the girls who
sold tickets for afternoon tea, and led them
into action with great elan. The cash
slaughter was terrific at times. Norman
Paxton was there, cold, stern and impassive
in the face of danger —a typical Son of
Empire—and I also noticed a khaki-clad
Bowes Kelly son. MacKinnons and Chirn-
sides were everywhere. Hope Campbell had
a character-writing tent, and Nina Bagot
ran a fortune-telling show opposite.
It is horribly plebeian and all that; but
even Haw-hawthorn has at last decided that
it must have-electric-trams. So far a Noah’s
Ark liorse-car has served the suburb quite
badly enough to keep away the crowd. But
when Kew gave in, the heart seemed to go
out of He-hawthorn, and its dawdling don-
key-cart is therefore doomed.
From my Adelaide correspondent:—
The Lyric Club is to come to life again in Pirie-
street some time in April. The members’ list in-
cludes most of the old supporters and a good many
new ones.
The Everard-Russell and Coles-Russell weddings
are to occur shortly after Easter. The brides-elect
are cousins. The Everard bridegroom hails from
Renmarlc; the other is a son of the late Speaker of
the House of Assembly.
■ Brewster Jones is arranging a Belgian Relief Fund
concert, at which Belgian chamber music will be
starred. His sister (Miss Bertha Jones), Mrs. H. H.
Hutton, Miss Muriel Cheek and Eugene Alderman will
perform.
Port Adelaide races and tennis divided attention
on Saturday. At the tennis luncheon the Edwin
Smith knight said a few kind words about Guy Fisher
and Harry Nott, They are ex-’Varsity players who
are now with the South Australian section of the
First Expeditionary Force.
The Women’s Arts and Crafts Society has gone to
Brookman’s Buildings, in Grenfell-street, where the
rooms will be open every afternoon.
Mrs. Culross and her daughters are to leave for
England in May. The W. F. Stocks and Arthur Hill
are returning by the incoming mail.
The water shortage has been fatal to the Botanic
Gardens, and two wells that were sunk to overcome
the difficulty produced water that was overstrong in
salt and could not be used.- However, a third was
successful —and then the carting- of the water
smashed up the paths over which the carts had to
travel. Finally Dr. Holtze installed a pumping-
plant, and obtained the Waterworks Department’s per-
mission to use tile pipes that were connected with the
gardens, so in a week or so, when the autumn
flowers come on, the accumulating dust-heap should
give way again to something resembling a garden.
The Government has bought the Hazelwood estate
near Burnside. It belonged to the late John Howard
Clark and his sister, and has been an unofficially
authorised pleasure-ground for years.
Surg-eon James, whose red lamp hangs out at
Wallaroo, is off to the ever-lengthening Profit, and
his wife goes as far as England, to be within coo-ee.
As Nurse Marsden, Mrs. James was on the Titanic
when the leviathan had its tragedy, and she received
special mention for saving a number of youngsters
who had been forgotten by their parents in the
general excitement.
The Town Hall looked like a green smile
on St. Patrick’s night. Munro Ferguson
and Archbishop tarr stood in brotherly
fashion upon the platform, and when the
cleric had finished talking vaguely of noth-
ing for half an hour, the Governor chipped
in and lengthily deplored the fact that he
had not been born an Irishman. The
Hennesseys guarded Lady Helen, with
Andrew Fisher as a sort of extra A.D.C.
There’s trouble brewing in the Lyceum
Club. The intellectuals can’t hit it off with
the mere frivollers, and latterly more of
the early-Victorian element lias crept in
than ever. The consequence is any candi-
date who doesn’t persistently look down
her nose and wear last year’s hat is liable
to be blackballed. It is bad for the victims,
but it is worse, really, for the Club.
Philip Grey-Egerton (the Cheshire baronet
who married the Rupert Clarke dame) has
just lost his second son in the usual manner.
He was a 20-year-old twin, and bore the
romantic name of Rowland le Belward.
The fact that the boy’s mother was a Yankee
may have had something to do with this
Corelli-like outbreak.
The Philip Itussells’ sou and heir has
been wounded and seized by the Huns. His
mother, a Geelong Guthrie, is in England,
struggling, of course, for an. exchange.
Doris Howitt marries Dr. Frank Cox, of
Bananaland, next month. He is a son of
a late Melbourne oculist and a grandson of
Dr. Mein, so you see his lineage is quite all
right. Dr. Godfrey Howitt will come up
from Broadmeadows to the ceremony. He
will drop in at the party, so to speak, on
his way to Egypt.
U.S. Consul-General Bray is to marry
Winifred Crabbe early in April. Miss
Crabbe, being a true descendant of the poet,
is a graceful penwoman, and has done a
good deal of work at odd times for Aus-
tralian papers. Mr. Bray is going consul-
iug in Singapore in a few weeks, so the
happy pair will not be in our midst much
longer.
The Sydney Salon-de-luxers are attacking
Melbourne. They have taken over the
South Yarra skating rink, and will give a
sample demonstration of what they can do
on Monday, March 29. This rink is in the
line of least resistance for Tooraketty motor-
cars, and has an interesting “walk home”
to St. Ivilda and P’ran, as well as a chain
of cars to almost every suburb under the
Melbourne sun. The new Salon hopes to
attract the Naicest when the sea breezes
blow too shrilly round the Palais de Danse.
The Carlyle Smythes are (or were, when
last heard from) in Java, en route for
Europe. They have already seen an active
volcano, had a motor accident and figured
at a special Rice Feast —all things that you
can’t very well dodge in Java. As for the
motor-car, the native chauffeur's idea is that
the more noise anything makes the better it
is, and another loose screw or explosion
anywhere is merely an added joy.
A Belgian Gift Tea is to occur on Friday,
April 9. The women of the Repertory
Theatre Club are giving the tea, and the
visitors are expected to provide the gifts,
which they will subsequently be expected to
also buy.
The Strollers, who arrived on Saturday
at the Auditorium, have a Forest-of-Arden
setting for their show. Girls with plump
legs and abbreviated skirts sit about on logs ;
the pianist uses a stump as a music-stool,
and when the lie-pianist is changed for a
slie-pianiste the top of the concern is ampu-
tated to a height that suits her. Ingenious,
isn’t it? When sentimental songs are
turned on a blue duskiness is manu-
factured and a camp-fire burns and
a gypsy pot is hung over the blaze
and in other respects a sylvan atmo-
sphere is aimed at. Madeline Rossiter, the
star dancer, has eyes as big as saucers and
as black as coal, and she wears cute, fringed
skirts of flimsy green over jet-black “undies.”
i atdy Stanley is working hard on a patri-
otic stunt that is all her own. She wants to
build a permanent recreation hall at Broad-
meadows Camp. The “permanent” looks
gloomy, but the approach of winter calls
for something solid. The nresent tent-hall
will be blown to Timbuctoo when the gales
arrive, and men obviously can’t recreate in
a tent that isn’t there. The Wimmen’s
League are helping all they know, and the
energetic Mrs. Earle is doing some secre-
tary work.
Talking of recreations, Gov. Stanley has
irritated some of the wowsers by suggesting
that there might be more meat in the enter-
tainments provided for the soldiers. That
is so. Chess and dominoes are hardly ath-
letic enough for many of the men, and the
“Mary Had a Little Lamb” style of ditty
tends to pall. The result is that bored war-
riors plunge recklessly into picture-shows,
and even boxing contests, with the inevitable
result that their immortal souls are im-
perilled. The Governor seems to see that
the entertainer who gets to work with a
glass of water in one hand and a tract in
the other is seldom entertaining —though
whether one in the position of a Governor
is wise in saying so is another matter.
.Another picture—this time of the Govern-
ment House dog show. The Ladies’ Kennel
Club ran it; the admission fee was a shilling,
and the proceeds went (o the Red Cross
Fund. No one was allowed into the vice-
regal mansion. Hence rage. The Fairrgus-
son is understood to cherish bitter memories
of the last occasion his home was thrown
open in the name of Empire. It was for a
Y.W.C.A. party, or something similar, and
lo ! as he was sitting in Iris private sanctum,
musing over a wee drappit (iced). there burst
in on him a female herd. _ lie reached for
his claymore; but gathering their snoods
around them they fled. He has forgiven, but
he will never forget. And that, I under-
stand, is why the dogs and their owners were
relegated to the farthest-out lawn —which
is cut off from the main grounds by a heavy
line of shrubbery.
The lawn was divided into “rings”—one
ring for each variety of hound. The Dachs-
hunds were in a (Concentration camp. Bull-
dogs are violently fashionable just now, and
there were plenty in evidence. Why do people
keep bulldogs—l mean, the sort that snore,
and dribble, and always want to go the other
way? I cannot understand it. The
Beebees’ Great Danes were held in
leash—-the whole three of them —by one
slim little woman with red hair and small
wrists made of steel. Carmen Delprat, large
and handsome in white linen, was plainly the
master of her Samoyede—the gift, by the
way, of her brother-in-law. He (the dog,
not the brother-in-law) is still a pup, and
is of pure Antarctic breed. His mother
saved Dr. Mawson’s life, and Mawson
assured her, at the time, that her family
should never want. He was called Durveille.
after the place of his birth —an icy region
named after Compte Durveille, the discov-
erer. Miss Delprat’s sister showed a lamb-
like poodle, which was held by a blue rib-
bon and kept well out of the way of Dur-
veille. Even poodles are capable of reason-
ing, on occasion, you see. Shackleton’s dog
—a big white Samoyede —collected for the
Bed Cross. He was harnessed up in red
leather, and had his long coat undipped in
spite of the heat. Some Belgian milk-cart
dogs were also doing collecting work. Don-
ald McKinnon strode about and gave an eye
to some setters that he owns. Mrs. Fritz
Hart had seven toy terriers hopping about
her. Dr. Buttner’s Poms, wore their best
yellow-ribbon bows. And doggy women were
everywhere. The very Doggiest wore their
hats at a barbed angle, and their tailor-mades
were covered with dog-hair and grass-seeds.
'There is No Nonsense about the really
doggy woman.
A tea-tent reared itself at an angle of the
shrubberies, and inside one could buy susten-
ance at a price. But, as I indicated before,
there was nothing whatever doing so far as
free food in the vice-regal ballroom was con-
cerned. How it does bring home to us the
Horrors of War!
Yours sincerely,
JOHANNA.
« C1Ulg ” : N.S.W. Minister Hall asks for
....u:,,
suggestions witll regard to lis new public

larger qviaut ity than anything else. Health
experts state that no portion of a loaf can
bo proper ly cooked that is more than two
inebes f rom the crust. The long French
loaf is the bosti and i£ the State bakery
would turn this out in quantity Hall needn’t
worry so much about making a cheap article.
The best is the cheapest.
i t is interesting to watch the Sydney City
Council when it finds itself tangled up in
the argument about fruit-shops and barrow-
men. The fruitshop-keeper is a ratepayer
with votes to give away, and in some cases
lie is also a tenant of the Council. Having to
pay an exorbitant rent for the place in
which he sells fruit, he naturally howls
about the unfair competition of barrers, and
for the reasons just mentioned the howls
have to be regarded. But the Council offi-
cially believes in cheap fruit, which the
hawker provides; and interference with the
public benefactor would annoy other voters
who are not affluent Dagoes. Therefore the
Council falls back on deep diplomacy. The
last time it considered the matter it
decided “to obtain a report”—this makes
the 50th—“from the officers before taking
action.” This is on the well-known principle
that when you are afraid to fire off your
own gun, the best thing to do is to fool as
ma ?y as can by getting a hireling to
m ake a report tor you.
George Black s first job as Clnei Secre-
tary of N.S.W. _ was to grapple with the
Sunday sale of ginger-beer and fruit. Black s
method was to seize the ancient statute _ o
Charles 11. which governed the situation
and throw it out of the window. Then he
wrote to the police intimating t hat tle
public thirst for gaseous liquids and hungei
tor bananas were not to be interfered wit i
—“provided the doors of the shops were
only kept slightly ajar during the hours of
d j v j ne service.” Apparently, therefore, until

anomalies of the situation, as Black found
were ludicrous. In Sydney and suburbs

oil Sundays without restraint, but in the
C()Un try such places have been sealed down,

MARY (resenting correction by her lawful
spouse): “ You—you—you blurry Tcher-
man!"
“Lagaui-Namo”: The unsophisticated
children of nature at Hanuabada entertained their
first European visitors with some hobgoblin descrip-
tions of tribes elsewhere in the Territory. According
to the narrative, there were, around the Gulf of
Papua, a people with webbed toes who were able
to walk over the water-lilies and other floating vege-
tation of their swamps. Instead of the bow and
arrow, these folk had a powerful dart which they
operated thus. Every male child’s left hand had a
hole bored clean through the palm, and gradually
distended to -Finch in diameter. Then it was
cauterised, so that it would heal with a smooth
interior. Into the orifice the dart was inserted, and
carefully sighted. Then the right arm swung a mallet
and drove the missile at the target. The effective
range was alleged to be something about 100 yards.
I offered myself as a target at that distance, but my
native retinue surrounded me in a body and begged
me not to leave a useless, unnecessary corpse on
their hands. To oblige them, I withdrew the offer.
“The Reefer”: “Spraggs” (B. IS/2/T5)
seems inclined to blame good liquor for the peculiar
mustard-colored snake he saw, and he may be right.
But this is my case. A few years ago, as I was
struggling over the mountains between Baruni and
Ilagari, in Papua, my dog, which was a few yards
ahead, suddenly threw a hand-spring. The occasion
was a snow-white snake, something after the archi-
tecture of a death-adder, and about 3ft. long. To
this day I’ve regretted that I didn’t stop to capture
and preserve him, but I had a string of female
carriers with me, who might have used the halt to
desert. Both the dog and myself had been living
solely on sweet potatoes, sugar-cane and paw-paws
for longer than a week, so that unusual snake
couldn’t have been a jim-jam.
* * * *
“Ed.”: We all felt for Bob Blake, tie
was engine driving at the Parkers’ Miners, an ami-
able, harmless native of 30, and unmistakably gone
on Mabel Curran, daughter of Tin Curran, a gintle-
man reasonably supposed to be possessed of real
estate and a long procession of cows, but a drifting
and incompetent agriculturist, and a man with
scarcely energy enough to keep his trousers up. Bob
had been signalling Mabel and following on for
some months before venturing into Curran’s kitchen.
Curran welcomed him, and raised no objection even
after Blake had wasted a month’s Sundays in the
Curran parlor. But about this time Tim intervened
one evening, and after carefully locking the parlor
door, he said: “I’d be havin’ a wor-rd wid ye, misther
Blake, ’n’ yer not in anny great hurry at all.” Bo!)
was in no particular hurry. “Yer a single bachelor
wid no call on yeh wan would mention, ’n’ ye have
the fine job beyant, ’tis a nate sum yill have Shtowed
away for the day yill wed, ’n’ yeh could shpare me
a thriflin’ twinty pounds aisy, till the time I’ve me
shpuds dug if yid the moind to.” Blake lent Curran
twenty pounds, but after that noticed a diminution of
Tim’s cordiality. “ ’Tis a quare, throublesome
thing, a poor man can’t be aytin’ his bit to his own
house wid privacy ’n’ comfort for the stranger that
do be pushin’ in,” he said one Sunday at tea. On
the following evening he found Bob in the parlor,
and said he: “There’s a fine white moon yid wish t’
see, misther Blake,” and when Blake looked out he
deliberately shut the door on him. Later he sajd:
“Yid oblige me thruly, did yeh stay away frim me
house a dale more than yiv been doin’, Bob Blake.”
Bob blushed. “You know I’m courtin’ Mabel, Mr.
Curran,” he said. “I’ve me suspicions,” Tim re-
plied. “You’re not opposed, Mr. Curran?” "’N’
why for no? Are yeh such a fine man, Bob Blake —
have yeh the clear brain?” “But you encouraged
me, and you borrowed £2O from me.” “That’s
the rale throuble,” said Curran. “ ’Tis fer. that
I’ll wish t’ wash me hands iv yeh. ’Tis like yer
impudence ’n’ insolence t’ continue, ixposed t’ one
in yer thrue character ez yeh ar-re. Would I be
such a fool, ’n’ such a ijit, mar-rk me, Misther
Blake, ez t” thrust the fate ’n’ the forchins iv me
only darther t’ wan havin’ no more sinse ’n’ per-
spicacity, Misther Blake, than to lend -3 me money?”
Eventually Bob gave up suing for Mabel and sued
for his money. That, too, was useless, all the pro-
perty being in Mrs. Curran’s name.

“Pick”: Can’t agree with “The Oldest
Inhabitant” that the misspelling- of Australian place-
names is due to careless
habit. To me it appears
that departmental ; sat-
raps, obsessed with a
sense of superior- know-
ledge, are more account-
able. Panbula (N.S.W.)
is, and always was, so
spelt by the Lands De-
partment ; but the Postal
Department, when mails
were • first delivered
there monthly per boot,
altered the name to the
now more generally-,
accepted “Pambula.”
Incidentally the original'
name was. something that
sounds more like Pun-
boola. As another in-
stance, the present ter-
minus of the Cooma rail-
way line has been spelt
“Mmitybelle” since the
oldest blue-nose of the
Monaro highlands was a
boy. But the other day,
when the first circuitous
train from Sydney heaved
along, some official
shocked the community
by screwing up the distortion “Nimmitabel” on the
platform.
* * * *
It was a very drunken hiccough that called
up the “Hello” girl at three o’clock the other morn-
ing—the girls take night shift in S. Aus. “Hie—l
shay, Shentral —liic —where am I? —hie.” Maybelle
gave him the address of the obscure public telephone
box he was hanging on to. But that didn’t put
him right. “There, Shentral?—hie—l shay, how do
I get home?” The little lady whispered into his
ear to hold on where he was and she’d fix things.
Then she rang a taxi-cab stand, and in due time
a well-blithered citizen was on his way to bed and
repentance. She was a good sport, that girl.
* * * *
“Spraggs”: Mrs. Public House was the
maddest woman in Jerebangerie one night last week.
It came about this way. She had got in arrears
with the brewing co. and had made some sort of an
offer to save the position. The co. wired her: “Send
50 pounds at once, save further trouble.” Perkins,
the local postmaster and telegraph operator, having
no messenger handy, ’phoned her the ultimatum, and
you ought to have heard what she called him. “The
dhirty scum,” she explained, perspiring with
passion; “the likes of him to open my telegrams.”
I wouldn’t have been Perkins for quids.
AT COURT.
POLICE MAGISTRATE ( recognising dilapidated old offender in dock): “Ah, Hennessy,
what’s brought you here this time?"
HENNESSY: "Two policemen, yer Worship."
P.M.: “Drunk again?"
HENNESSY: “Yis, yer Worship, both of them."
“Cambridge” : The symptoms of the Birds-
ville horse disease (B. 18/2/’l5) are much the same
as you find in horses attacked by ■ bot flies. I saw
a very valuable draught horse in Tasmania taken ill
at five o’clock in the morning, following receipt of
his breakfast, and after suffering the greatest agony
lie was dead before midday. The local vet. was called
in at nine o’clock, and at once gave it as his
opinion that the horse was past aid. A post-mortem
was held, and one part of the animal’s intestines was
found to resemble a piece of mosquito net more
than a useful organ. Bot grubs by the dozen had
their heads firmly embedded. There is no cure for
the disease. Any drench strong enough to make
the grub let go his hold would be strong enough to
kill the horse.
“The Giggling Undertaker”: It was a
blistering, blinding day. The mild, middle-aged
Mountain orchardist in the corner had a battered
leather bag and a brown paper parcel on the rack;
and every time the train rocked round' a curve and
a breath of hot wind blew athwart the compartment,
I got a whiff of fish that was clamoring for burial.
The patient,, sleepy traveller on the opposite seat
opened his tired eyes every now and then and gazed
sadly at the parcel containing the late lobster. (You
could tell it was a lobster by the shape.) The mild
man who was accompanying the body said no word
until the train started to climb out of some place
that was 2000 ft. above the sea, but just on a level
with the worst smell of a hot summer. “That’s my
station!” he shouted excitedly, and, leaping up,
tried to put his hat under his arm and the obscene
fish on his head. “It’s too late!” shouted the other
man, and threw his arm across the door the excited
orchardist was trying to open. “Yes,” sighed the
orchardist, collapsing suddenly into his seat, “and
I wanted to get home before this went off.” He
touched the parcel lovingly. “I’m afraid it’s gone,”
said the other man emphatically. “In fact, I’ve
been thinking so for the last hour.” “Yes,” i
chimed in, “it’s gone all right. If I were you I’d
chuck it out the window.” “Oh, no,” said the
owner plaintively, “I won’t do that—l’m fond of
lobster.... The wife may be able to make it into a
salad yet.” Then we all relapsed into silence,’as
people do at a funeral, and the train crawled across
deep, mysterious -gullies and at least one beautiful
deep cool river in which a dead-and-gonc
lobster could have slept for ever. But he
refused to do the obvious thing. Instead,
he hugged his armful of ptomaines to his
vest; and when the train drew up at a tiny,
shadeless platform he got out, laid his dreadful
treasure on the hot seat to affront the solemn
mountains, and sat down beside it to commence his
long vigil. I waved a last farewell to the devoted
corpse-owner from the carriage window; he was his
own stomach’s worst enemy, but he was apparently
going to his death out of respect for his terrible bit
of property. Every man who respects Property is en-
titled to a last salute.
“Sammy”: I have just sooled the dog on
to the most curious turn-out I've struck to date. It
was tucker-time, and I had just Ashed the lGth fly
out of the jam when the contraption hove in sight.
Hitched on behind a horse that would have made a
country parson’s nag look like a show heavyweight
was a two-wheeled cart with a clearance of a foot.
There was a hood over the top, in no part more than
3ft. above the floor of the cart. The turn-out came
to a full stop at the front door, and the horse at
once leaned back on the cart and nearly upset the
whole show. Then a whiskery face poked out from
underneath the cover, surveyed the landscape, fell
out and brought an untidy old fossil with it. There
wasn’t room to get out at the side of his car, so the
owner of the dirty face pushed the horse off the
cart, dropped down between the shafts and crawled
out that way. Then the horse leaned back again.
A FREE HAND.
FOOTBALLER: "Well, anyway, there's no
bloomin' umpire here to crook a bloke."
On the tilt of the cart was painted “Razur and sissor
ground,” with a picture of what might have been a
razor or a plough—he told me afterwards that it was
a razor. Tied on to the back was a grindstone. He
stayed for an hour advising me about agriculture in
general, borrowed a pipe of tobacco, and then “s’posed
’e’d ’ave t’ be goin’.” But he didn’t go; he kept on
s’posin’ for another hour, and would have been at it
still if I hadn’t mobilised the dog.
(Continued on page 24-)
THE WAY OF IT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Mr. Duraclc, M.L.A., in opening Oberon Show,
was subjected to interruption.
A voice: We wish you were all in Hades!
A voice: But who has to pay for it?
Another voice: And you can’t live on the land.
A voice: And now you are taxing the men off the
land.
Another voice: But you get your salaries all the
time.
A voice: But have you paid for it? —Daily paper.
’Twas eventide at Bunyip East;
The township was at tea.
There brooded over man and beast
A sense of things to be.
As night closed round those distant parts
They lighted up the School of Arts.
By sulky, buck-board, bike and horse,
Converging from afar,
They surged around the pub in force
And crowded out the bar.
The tank proposed at Sandy Blight
Was what had brought them there that night.
Locked in the bathroom, Wentworth Jones,
The district’s M.L.A.,
Rehearsed in deep, sepulchral tones
The words he meant to say.
His speech was modelled on the work
Of Sheridan and Edmund Burke.
A rustle. Then, on time accrued,
The chairman takes his place;
And Jones, his every move imbued
With practised Thespic grace,
Running his fingers through his hair,
Takes up his stand beside the Chair.
He said they had assembled there —•
Disturbance, shouts and cries—
He challenged any—here a pair
Of missiles hit the flies.
It was the Mayor who stopped the first;
On him a ripe old tom-cat burst.
Jones said: “The man who stood unmoved”—
Shouts of “To Hell! Get work!” —
He said: “The charge was never proved”—
An egg shot through the murk.
A vote of thanks was then proposed.
The people left. The hall was closed.
And so the sulkies started back;
The buck-board, bike and horse,
Through mile on mile of winding track
Plugged on their patient course.
And with the dawn the steaming sun,
Rose on a public duty done.

SHE DARKENED HER
GREY HAIR.
A Well-known Lady Darkened Her Grey
Hair and Stimulated Its Growth
by a Simple Home Process.
She Tells How She Did It.
A well-known society lady, who darkened
her grey hair by a simple home process,
made the following statement: “Any lady
or gentleman! can darken their grey or faded
hair, stimulate its growth and make it soft
and glossy with this simple recipe, which
they can mix at home. To half a pint of
water add loz. of bay rum, 1 small box of
Orlex Compound and ioz. of glycerine. These
ingredients can be purchased at any chemist
at very little cost. Apply to the hair every
other day until the grey hair is darkened
sufficiently, then every two weeks. This
mixture relieves scalp troubles and is excel-
lent for dandruff and falling hair. It does
not stain the scalp, is not sticky or greasy,
and docs not rub off. It will make a grey-
haired person look 10 to 20 years younger.’ *

“Quidam” : Is there anything more dismal
than a deserted mine? If so, put me somewhere
else. Here I am, with the stilly night and the
good old gumtrees around me, and the tent that has
sheltered me for many months over me, and above
that again the glittering stars in a dear Australian
sky. Everything is sylvan peace and quiet. Yet
all is gloom and loneliness. Not a soul to speak to ;
not a sound from the mill. It is all very well to talk of
peaceful solitude and the simple life; but every other
minute I expect to see Bill or Joe or Jack come in,
and then I remember that the place is shut down,
and that I am here alone, and Bill and Jack and Joe
won’t come in any more. And that makes all the
difference. Take the mining crowd around, they are
a cheery push. Always a gleam of humor, and given
to putting a comical turn on even the worst of
situations. Old Abe Lincoln said there was a lot of
human nature in human nature. There is an extra
lot in the mini-ng crowd. And what a streak of
optimism! How many bonanzas did we discover or
remember or invent round the fire at night? What
an ass a man was to be grafting for wages when so
many good shows are lying about loose all over Aus-
tralia, only waiting for a little work! Gold shows,
copper shows, tin shows, tailings—Heaven knows
what! And what an expanse of country they covered !
Charters Towers and Croydon and Gympie and Cobar
and Burraga and Ballarat and Stawell and Bendigo,
right away round to the Golden West. How easy when
aeroplanes become common to investigate most of
them ; and how invariably disappointing the few adja-
cent ones we do inspect! Never mind, there are always
the others. The further off they are the more they
glitter. Be the world never so discouraging, it soon
becomes a good world —a bright, beautiful, golden
world —when three or four miners are gathered to-
gether, especially if there are drinks about. There
wouldn’t be much mining if it were not for the in-
curable optimism of the people who follow it; and
then the hard-headed business person, who counts
the value of everything in & s. d., comes along,
and they go off again following shadows and occa-
sionally finding some substance. But here and now
there are no more bonanzas, and no more Harry with
his patriotic enthusiasm for Maoriland, or Bill with
his wide experience of North and West, or Joe
with his easy-going philosophy and his stories of
his kiddies’ sayings and doings that showed where his
heart lay. And no more cursing of the ancient-
rattle-trap miscalled an engine, that intermittently
supplied the necessary power, and coughed and
grunted and groaned and squeaked while doing so.
Silent all the talk concerning “her” idiosyncrasies
and those of other weird and wonderful contraptions
in various other parts of the continent; and silent,
too, all the good-humored, profane, outspoken growl-
ing about the troubles of the day. Nothing but
silence, barring a mournful mopoke—damn the
bird !
NOTHING TO TALK ABOUT.
"Yer very quiet , Edward!”
“Yus; this is the first drink I've' ad to-day. ”
to the slaughter-yard. He is also talking of using-
poisonous sprays on the beasts’ food plants. As one
often notices great quantities of the insects on
bushes of wild fig and other shrubs, the beetle is in
foy a bad time if the spray proves a success. The
small boy regards it as a dangerous innovation,
curses it as Socialism, and says the time isn’t ripe.
He makes good pocket-money out of the pest.

DOCTOR: “There is no danger now , though at one time it was a very doubtful case."
MR. COHEN: “Dot life insurance gompany vos in luck."
“Gus Gosh”: “Rag” (B. 14/1/’l5) recalls
an army of dead marines he once saw on the
Southern Cross-Kalgoorlie route. If England had
sent as many live marines to help in the defence of
Antwerp as there are dead ones along the Geraldton-
Meekatharra track, the attacking German army, or
what was left of it, would only have stopped running
to barricade itself under the bed. Lying on both
sides of that railway line are the stark corpses of
thousands whose fighting careers were ended by
being thrown from passing trains. In their endless
numbers they resemble the grim relics which whitened
the snow on Napoleon’s retreat from Moscow. That
squat, round-bellied fellow who once guarded my
pet brand of whisky ; the long emu-necked chap upon
whose uniform the brandy-drinker once gazed with
loving pride; the dark-colored cove who on some
bygone day emerged gaily through the portals of
his native brewery; the small, flat hero who once
journeyed with a bagman; the amende individual
who bore the parson’s lemonade —they dot the arid
wastes of the Murchison. One of these days, when
I have finished my course of lessons (by post) on
the art of versifying, I’m going to write a poem
on the heartlessness of man. There must be reams of
unwritten poetry in the thirsty traveller
Who fondles tenderly for but a day
The loved one whom he soon will chuck away,
or words to that effect. Meantime I shall get in
touch with one of Henry Lawson’s cobbers —the
bottle-o of Elder Man’s Lane. With his professional
knowledge and my experience we could make the
business of rescue pay as well as a butcher’s shop.

“Outcast” : I think that “Lagani-Namo”
(B. 24/12/’14) is incorrect when he says that the
black and green sea-worms (palolo) make their
appearance only once in the year. At any rate they
roll up twice a year in Samoan waters. Generally
they arrive an hour or two before sunrise, and brown
brother and sister turn out with the keenest expecta-
tion for the hunting. The apparatus consists of any-
thing handy, from a piece of matting to a slice of
window curtain. The swarm lasts for only two
days, and if you miss it you have to cadge your
palolo at the village. The orthodox method' ;of
cooking is to wrap the delicacy in banana leaf and
bake it. If it is occasionally rebalced it will last
for a long while. The taste is like nothing else that
I know, but the smell has a slight disagreeable coral
tinge. -By the-, way, the palolo has. been reported
also in the islands of the Louisiade Archipelago
(Papua). The late Mat,, Mofeton, when R.M. at
Woodlark Island, was the first to draw attention to
the existence of this interesting fish or worm or
whatever you like to term it.
“Cheetah”: Away back in the dim and
dusty past some inland mariner, in a fit of abstrac-
tion, maybe, dropped a ease of bottled wine over-
board from a Murray steamer. The other day the
consignment came to light in the dry bed of the
stream. When sampled most of the mislaid cargo
was voted by the way-back connoisseurs to be equal
to the best. The toast went aloft to a benign
Providence: “Do it again.” It really seemed as
though the fervent prayer had been answered when
the Word went round .that . another case of bottled
stuff had been found close handy. Away hurried
the talent to the gargle; but alas! - The find com-
prised a dozen or two of castor oil, in excellent
condition. The “ile” was unselfishly reserved for the
missus and the kids. Meanwhile the name of
Providence is not what it was in the neighborhood.
“Outcast” : I think the gentle South Sea
savage is not deliberately cruel, but is just merely
ignorant of pain. Among the man-eating tribes of
the north of Papua the unfortunates who had the
bad luck not to be killed outright in a raid almost
invariably had their legs and arms broken to prevent
escape, and were then trussed up on poles, exactly
as pigs, to be carted home to the village larder.
The prospectors Campion and King, killed on the
Kumusi, in 1902, were said to have been treated
this way. A turtle is always cut up alive purely
from a gastronomic fad. The usual way my cook
attempts to kill a pigeon or fowl, if I don’t happen
to be looking, is by either breaking its legs or bash-
ing its head against a post. He then proceeds to
pluck it. Nine-tenths of the pigs are killed by
banging them with sticks. It’s apt to be a long job,
but nobody is in a hurry thereabouts.
“Mrs. Lance Rawson”: The best house
servant I ever had was a Tanna girl called Nar. Ai
10 years of age she had been captured during one
of the tribal fights that were, by all accounts, of
frequent occurrence before the advent of the mis-
sionaries. Being young, plump and healthy, she
was handed over to the old chief, who was not only
rheumatic and very aged, but blind, and absolutely
toothless. Nar was installed as chief handmaid or
off-side wife, to chew his food and keep warmth and
vitality in his ancient and unpious bones. Needless
to say, she hated the old he-goat and all his tribe
and generation. About this time Captain Wawn,
in the Stanley, was recruiting among the Islands for
boys for the Queensland plantations, and Nar decided
to use the schooner as a means of escape. One
night, when there was a general fight going on, she
made the old man (who was quite powerless) a good
big bed of dry grass, and having tucked him up
comfortably, stuck a fine, healthy firestick well into
the middle of the mattress and bolted for the beach
and the outlying vessel, in company with the old
chief’s youngest and favorite daughter, a girl named
Klebben. The two girls swam the five miles to the
ship, where they were taken on board and brought
to Maryborough (Q.). Nar was decidedly an inter-
esting woman, for several reasons. When in a talka-
tive mood she would tell me about the horrible
orgies that used to be quite common when she was
a child. She would say, “Hurricane come; spoil
everything; no more cocoanut stop; no taro; no
everything; only plenty mans. So we kaikai mans.
That very good.” She had seen her father and
mother and several others of her people absorbed by
her own captors; and she put down her own reprieve
to the fact that she had good, sound teeth. These
provided new masticators for her old he-goat, and
were also just the ivories for the making of kava.
“Peri-Winkle”: A great pilgrimage is
being undertaken just now in the Swan Hill (Vic.)
regions by that small amphibian, the fresh-water
turtle. Old haunts, fast drying up, are being de-
serted, and the late tenants are making across
country to lakes with water in them. It’s a long, pre-
carious journey, and the route is lined with cold, cal-
culating crows, all at hair-trigger expectancy for
one of the game little crawlers to sky his toes.
Another terror to the tiny travellers is the cocky’s
cart, which crushes them remorselessly. But in
face of all the dangers the turtle battles on. I
bow respectfully to him.

“8.W.”: In Maewo, New Hebrides, when
a girl child is born, the relative of an eligible male
child puts in an application for her as the boy’s
future wife. After the preliminary negotiations
have been satisfactorily arranged the prospective
husband is carried to her house with a bamboo of
water and his hands are guided to splash the bride-
elect. The match is then regarded as binding. Still,
in the New Hebrides, as elsewhere, it’s a long way
to Tipperary.
“McDuff” : This is to notify The Bulletin
that I have this day cabled to Lord Kitchener as
follows—
Playing crib. Noticed card moving along table.
Investigated. Cause of animation, small hard
beetle. Going full speed ahead with ace diamonds.
Put another card on ace to test carrying capacity.
Still advanced like Russians. Threw on weighty
influence of ten clubs. Didn’t notice it. Kept
adding cards. Beet, heaved along in short jolts
with dozen. Could supply beetle transport teams.
Wire terms per ton per mile.
THE SINS OF THE FATHER.
BERTIE: “By jings, Dad, you're about as
rocky as I am at arithmetic. Last night
I asked you how much £30,000 was, and
you said a devil of a lot. Then when I
told teacher he gave me a hiding."
“Lou” : There's a mixed crew in a road-job
camp in Gippsland, where I dally with the pick.
We've got a compositor, a tailor’s cutter, a, butter*
factory ex-manager, a saddler, Danish piano-tuner,
four immigrants from the wilds of Manchester, three
assorted eats, a Norman Lindsay bear, a ’possum, a
dozen variegated dogs, five mere Australians and a
deaf bullock driver.
“Rill Bowyang”: The Queensland sugar
cocky has been working overtime this year trying
to slay the beetle pest. The oldest cane-grower doesn’t
remember seeing the curse so plentiful. It
appeared about Christmas time, and again late in
January. Some idea of its abundance may he
gathered from the fact that on January 25 four
collectors in half an hour picked 231 b. of beetles
from the fence of the Gordonvale Recreation Reserve
in the centre of the township. It takes on an average
475 to weigh lib., so the pick represented 10,925
beetles. The cocky is finding acetylene light much
superior to kerosene light for attracting the beetles
HER UNANSWERED PRAYER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Two spinster sisters live alone
In Winnalinger town.
To visitors their house is shown.
Their maiden name is Brown.
A touching story will attest
Their long-sustained and hopeless quest.
The linen pillowed Mary’s head
When came her sister Vi,
And timidly beneath the bed
She cast an anxious eye.
“No use,” the elder maid began,
“I’ve looked already for the man.”
Then down again with humble knees
In supplication bent
To raise the customary pleas
The younger lady went.
“No use! No use! Come into bed.

Take Sanatogen
It’s sure to give you
Better Health, Strength
and Nerve-power.
If you are in need of a
tonic, nothing will do you
so much good as a course
of Sanatogen.
Whether you are only a
little weak and run down,
or suffering from some
definite disorder of nerves,
digestion or nutrition —
there is no doubt that a
course of Sanatogen will
be of real and lasting
benefit to you.
Remarkable Statements by
Famous Men and Women.
Start that course of Sanatogen
to-day. You won’t have to wait
long to feel the good of it. Never
mind if you are a little sceptical
now. Only give Sanatogen a fair
trial, and you will soon be con-
vinced, enthusiastic !
“Sceptical as I was,” writes
Sir William Bull, M.P., “I am
bound to say that Sanatogen per-
forms what it promises to do.
It has a wonderfully restorative
effect.”

“It is only fair to say,’’ writes Sir Alexander
Cross, Bart., “ that I have been surprised at the
results of Sanatogen. They have been just what
was predicted —a material increase in vigour and
physical fitness.”
Again, Mr. Arnold Bennett, the leading
novelist and playwright (author of “ Milestones,”
“The Old Wives’ Tale,” etc.), writes: “The
tonic effect of Sanatogen on me is simply
wonderful.” And Mrs. Kensington, wife of
Mr. Justice Kensington, Lahore, India, writes :
“I and Mr. Kensington have tried Sanatogen,
and have both found it a wonderful reviver and
tonic. It is also the best cure for digestive
troubles that I have come across.
Let Sanatogen improve your Health.
Such statements —typical of thousands of
others —cannot fail to impress even a prejudiced
reader. For they were sent voluntarily by
shrewd men and women, of high character and
position—not at all the sort of people to be
carried away by facile enthusiasms, or to be
deceived by illusory sensations of benefit.
Will you do as they did? Will you, in fair-
ness to your own health, give Sanatogen a
thorough trial ?
Write to-day for a Free Booklet.
Simply drop a post-card, mentioning this paper,
to The Sanatogen Co., 17 Bond Street, Sydney,
N.S.W. They will send you, free, an interesting
booklet, called “How to Live Healthily/’ which
tells you all about Sanatogen.
Afterwards, a regular course of Sanatogen (sold
by all Chemists from 2/6 per tin), will cost you
about sevenpence a day —not a “speculation,” but
a sound “investment,” yielding you as guaranteed
dividends “a wonderfully restorative effect” and “a
material increase in vigor and physical fitness!”
And there is no risk —Sanatogen cannot hurt you
in any way, and cannot fail to do you good, lake
the first step now —there’s no time like the
present!
“Seven Little Australians” is having a
healthy innings in Maoriland, anti the_ co.
has been taken to the fickle bosom of Society.
In Australia Vera Spaull had the head-line,
but over the water Cecil Haines is M.L. s
own particular smart child, and the astute
Beaumont Smith acts accordingly. Cecil
gets the boom and Beaumont the boodle.
Neither of them lias offered a word of pro-
test.
“Rosna”: Mrs. Brough (Bell) is playing in
)'« Jingo-drama, “The Man Who Stayed at
Home.” here at the London Royalty. The
show is of the “Englishman’s Home” order,
and the plot circles round the spy peril, but
the audience, which mostly thinks football
far more important than German waiters,
treats it as a high old joke and shouts with
laughter from start to finish. Mrs. Brough s
husband has been driving a motor ambulance
in London and France, and is hoping for a
commission in the navy. At the outset, by
the way, the War Office almost lost his ser-
vices by informing him that, haying been
born in Sydney, he was not a British sub-
ject. It didn’t actually say he was a Hotten-
tot, but clearly suspected it. Later, having-
got a map, it went down on its hands and
knees and apologised for the slight error.
“Cockaigne”: “The Silver King” revives
memory of Barrett’s glory-time. Vv hat a
surprise in the profession it was when it
became known that the solemn and mature
vestal star, Miss Heath, had married her
young leading man, Barrett. She went about
with a kind of aureole, having been reader
by appointment to Queen Victoria. Their
two sons have been farmers in Maoriland.
Barrett first impinged notably on London
supporting Modjeska in “Heartsease” and
“Donna Juana.” One Kelly financed him at
the Princess’s. His hit was made with
“Lights o’ London, ’’ which Sims had hawked
all round London, ltignold always main-
tained it was better than “The Silver King" ;
but it was not such a blister, except at the
tirst. Next came Sims’s “Romany Rye,”
which ought to have been more attractive
with its gipsy tinge and many scenes ; then
“The Silver King.” When Barrett came to
Australia he had become hard, metallic,
mechanical, perhaps over-musical. There
was freshness and impulse in his early London
work, though always a thread of the com-
monplace. He was bourgeois English, while
Irving, cock of the walk, was essentially
French, with fine imagination, romance,
subtlety and mystery. Irving hit off Barrett’s
Hamlet with: “He never saw the Ghost.”
No, just a nice carpenter! He could not get
plays. Then Hall Caine came along, and
Barrett wrought upward again, though in-
solvent all the time until “The Sign of the
Cross” freed him.
“A.L.K.” : The impenitent “Masetto” again
urges (B. 4/3/’l5) the tiresome theory of
Verdi’s debt to Wagner, and, in support,
states that Verdi was swayed by Wagner, as
the latter was by Weber. Then, with beau-
tiful irrelevancy, “Wagner admits this debt.”
Yes, but Verdi admitted no debt to Wagner.
With almost his last breath, Verdi counselled
“Young Italy,” and especially Puccini, to
look back for inspiration to the classic
masters; to hold fast against the northern
irruption ; to be true to the Italian tradition
of song.
“G.G.” : I nominate Ballarat audiences as
the hardest in Australia to please. Vaude-
ville turns, domestic dramas, potted plays,
picture entertainments, musical comedies,
operas, pulpit orations, bellowdramas, panto-
mimes, ragtime orgies—everything, in fact, is
treated alike. Shows which are “riots” in
every other town, village, hamlet, city and
stockyard are welcomed to Ballarat with the
bird and the lemon and the icy eye and the
cold sneer. Even Melba and ’Arry Lauder
are generously damned with faint praise.
Very occasionally the miraculous happens,
and a show which is generally regarded else-
where as mediocre becomes a boom in Bal-
larat ; but that sort of circumstance is almost
as rare a thing as a modest mummer, and is
due to the cussedness of inanimate objects.
Ballarat these days is mostly inanimate
object.
“The Barrier” : The bandstand that deco-
rates Hyde Park (Sydney), and resembles a
cross between an antique stadium and a
saucer track, is to remain unoccupied for
this summer at least. The City Council
spent several thousands of Cohen’s cash in
constructing the delirious thing right against
the only tram line that crosses the park, so
that the gentle bellow of the trombone might
blend with the sweet rattle of the electric
cars. The Council now finds that it cannot
legally spend money on band music; hence
the silence and the spiders spinning cobwebs
where the euphonium might have brayed.
The “Aladdin” panto, at the Birmingham
Prince of Wales stars four familiar names.
Fred Leslie and . Ivy Shilling are _ doing
their jiu-jitsu dance, and Leslie is the
Grand Vizier. They are both labelled “Aus-
tralian” in large letters. Hope Charteris,
the Queensland girl, is Princess Badroul-
badour, and Winifred Ward, who was with
Hugh Mclntosh last year, is principal boy.
“J.F.H.” (from London) : F, It. Benson,
the chief of our finest Shakspearian co., is-
spending his leisure hours in learning to
drill and preparing to play his part in the
event of an invasion by the Huns. His
awkward squad embraces authors, artists,
sculptors and journalists, as well as actors.
The sergeant-major was at first visibly de-
pressed at their efforts to acquire the ele-
ments of drill. After the performance was
over Benson approached him and apologised
for their clumsiness and stupidity. “It’s just
this way, sir,” said the sergeant-major. “You
gentlemen think so much you are not ready
to do anything.”
“0. Ockney”: “Mid-Channel” on “H. 0.”
(B. 11/8/T5) “likes me much,” as Bernard
Shaw’s only rival, Bill Shakspeare, might
observe. Of course, Shaw’s prefaces to his
plays are quite out of place, and in many
cases are an added offence. Plays are never
easy to follow in the reading, wherefore it is
onlv sensible and expedient to encumber
them with as little stage-direction as pos-
sible. G.B.S. knows this as well as I do.
But he is a better word-spinner than play-
writer ; so, to impress the reader with his
cleverness, he loads an inferior play with
superior talk about it, and his audience
can’t see the wood for the trees. A play
demands “action.” SliaAV doesn’t know what
“action” means. He thinks it is supplied by
something concrete —a motor-car, for in-
stance. So he drags a motor-car into the
piece whenever he can. Shaw never has
acquired—seemingly, never will acquire—-
the dramatist’s art. Take his first stage-offer-
ing. “Widower’s Houses,” which would have
made a good piece handled by a craftsman.
It is a sociological tract —talk, talk, talk,
instead of vital “movement.” Take his last,
“Pygmalion.” No movement whatsoever,
always excepting that of the motor-car. Just
words, words, words, and had words at that.
From London: Marie Lohr has a showy
but stagey role as leading lady in the new
play at St. James’s —“Kings and Queens.”
Its author, Rudolf Besier, gives it this text
or motto : “Why, dears, they have five fingers
on each hand and take their meals regu-
larly.” In other words, Royal folks are
much the same as other folks. The play is
another version of the theme already used
by Pinero for “His House in Order.” Marie
has to be exceedingly gay at one time and
very pathetic at another. She has to elope
with a fascinating prince, spend a night on
a railway train, and return next morning as
good as new. The critics generally like her
performance; so did the first-night audience,
judging by the curtain calls it gave her.
“0.K.”: Cecil Raleigh, the Drury Lane
dramatist who died recently, tried hard to
be the most original of playwrights in Ins
sphere of action, which was the spectacular-
fashionable. Up to a point he succeeded.
His plots were audaciously circumstanced
in many cases. He strove for sensational
happenings under the most improbable
and novel conditions ; yet there Avas always
an air of reasonableness in the scenes he
devised. Where he failed was in the dra-
matic construction of his stories. . ,
were loose-jointed, and the effect was jerkj.
The best of them were no better than the
curate’s egg. “The Whip” was the least
ambitious and original; but it hung togethei
more closely than the others and was his
most profitable work. And it deserved well
for another reason: compared with all pre-
vious racing melodramas it showed by tar
the best knowledge of the turf.
“Stargazer”: Sara Bernhardt’s unkindest
cut of all, whereby she loses a prop and
stay, recalls a similar misfortune to a fruity
old pro. in Melbourne many years ago. The
veteran had borrowed a tame neddy for a
Sunday excursion, and the steed so severely
injured his leg, trying to scratch itself
against the corner of a wayside pub, that
Thespian had to be separated from one of
his left limbs. When George Coppm called
on the sufferer in hospital, George had his
own toe in a large bundle. “Henry, he
said to the patient, “let me congratulate you.
This accident reduces by 50 per cent, your
chances of getting gout.”
“Letusee”: “Jean Sibi” (B. 20/2/’l5),
writing about decadence in German literary
and dramatic taste, says that “the work of
the decadent Wedekind holds the theatres in
Germany, with the worst specimens of
Wilde’s work.” I produce for “Jean Slbfs”
annihilation programmes of some half-dozen
of the leading Viennese, Munich and Berlin
theatres and opera houses for the six months
preceding the outbreak of war. Wagnerian
opera had then been running continuously
for months, “Parsifal” being staged with
great splendor. The curtain rose at 4.30 in
the afternoon, with a dinner interval at
7.30, lasting till nine (dining salon in the
house). The curtain rose again on the in-
stant. Apart from opera, the theatres were
staging amongst other things Ibsen’s “Lady
from the Sea,” plays of Pinero and of Ber-
nard Shaw, Wilde’s “Salome” and “La Sainte
Gourtisane.” Neither of the latter cau possi-
bly be classed as decadent work. “Salome”
ranks as one of the masterpieces of English
literature, though its author wrote it origin-
ally in French. “La Sainte Courtisane” is
full of tenderness and of an understanding
all the wider and the fuller from Wilde’s
own ghastly weaknesses. Except for one
single passage in “Salome” there is not a sen-
tence which might not be read by a child of
10. Wedekind has certainly been staged in
different cities of Germany, but his appeal
has not been wide, though a certain pessimis-
tic mysticism or fatalism appeals to the
Teutonic temperament. The fact behind all
this is that Germany, whatever its sins may
be, gives more encouragement to good drama
and music than any other country in Europe.
Walter Bentley has been made a life
member of the Highland Society of N. S.
Wales. Bentley is a fine old actor; _ but
when the kail is flowing, and the haggis is
waving in the breeze, and the auchterlonies
are skirling he can remember nothing except
that he is an old Scotsman—an attractive
characteristic in a community where most
Scots are Hebrews.
THE KIND CRITIC.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I am a critic, and I write
About the-play I saw last night:
“The hero’s clever and refined”
(I hate the brute. He bored me blind).
“The play has an ingenious plot”
( That’s short for •pestilential rot)
“The moral all who run may read”
(And those iclto ran were wise indeed).
“The leading lady spoke her lines
With great distinction” (Rot! She whines!).
“She looked the part... .Much pleasure gave”
(And 1 was yawning like a grave).
We read of pros, who must be gay
E’en when their heart’s blood drips away,
And for these sad comedians we
Are asked to spread our sympathy.
Will none a moan of pity raise
For critics who must praise and praise
When they are really in a state
Of being curdled up with hate?
VICTORIA.

THE Overland is a car of remark-
able safeness and endurance
because it has extraordinary
strength in every part.
We supply forgings in the Overland
at many points where castings are
used in other cars. Forgings are
stronger and lighter. They cost the
average smaller manufacturer so
much more that he cannot afford to
use them. They cost us no more
because we make so many Overland
cars that we can afford to own and
operate our own drop forging plant.
In many cars the front axle is made
of two pieces, welded together. The
front axle of the Overland is drop
forged from a single piece. This
greatly increases strength.
In like manner, the Overland is
designed and built throughout to
withstand greater strains than it will
ever receive. It is not an “assembled”
car, made of parts built by various
other manufacturers. Almost every
part of the Overland is built by
The Willys-Overland Company. Its
strength and unusual endurance have
been amply proved by years of use
on the worst of roads.

ALMOST IMMEDIATE BELIEF OB-
TAINED BY TAKING DR. MORSE’S
INDIAN ROOT PILLS. CROW’S
NEST LADY’S PRAISE.
“I took Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills in
Melbourne, on the recommendation of a
friend, for the relief of habitual constipa-
tion.” writes Mrs. Lillie Pearce, of Lane
Cove Road. Crow’s Nest, North Sydney,
“and found them do much good, almost im-
mediately relieving me from the dreadful
headaches, etc., and I am now never without
them in my home. I have, also found them
a very useful medicine with some of my
children, as I am the mother of five. I
frequently recommend Dr. Morse s Indian
Root Pills to my friends. You can use this,
if useful, in hopes of assisting others to
relief.” Thousands of people in all parts
of Australia and the world will confirm Mrs.
Pearce’s statement. Dr. Morses Indian
Root Pills are the ideal family remedy for
the little ills of life.*
POLITICAL
POINTS
THE UNFIT.
Regret was expressed by the War Minister at the
failure of the factories to complete orders and fulfil
expectations. The Government, Lord Kitchener
stated, was arranging a system whereby the works
of important armament firms would come under Gov-
ernment control. — Cable.
K ITCHENER: “Yes, you’re expanding all
right. But THIS is inhere I want it.”
“S.S.”: Matches are made in Melbourne,
and the manufacturers declare they are get-
ting no more for their goods than formerly.
But the war has resulted in a failure of the
match crop abroad, no shipments are
coming in, and sundry bellowing patriots
in Melbourne, having secured by contract all
the local output for some time, to come, are
putting up prices for the retail trade, and,
of course, for the consumer. What I am
most curious to know is how it comes about
that the poor common soldier, with no fine
notion of ethics, is shot for looting at the
Front, while the market-riggers can loot at
home to their heart’s desire. I know there
is a difference —Tommy loots our enemies;
“Tummy” loots us.
Before the war Sydney City Council
ordered several Ileutschel street-sweeping
machines from Berlin ; and though they have
actually arrived, they cannot be purchased
because of the Enemy Trading Act. While
the Council pondered over the position the
other day, it was suggested that an arrange-
ment might be made whereby they could be
taken over at once and paid for after the
war. Although the plan of paying for some-
thing in the dim, uncertain future usually
appeals to Australian politicians and aider-
men, the Council didn’t catch on. Instead
it was decided that two machines should be
ordered —from America. The idea that Aus-
tralia could make a machine that could
scrape up dirt is, of course, wild presump-
tion. True, it does make more gold and tin
dredges than either Germany or the U.S.A.;
but how can you expect an alderman to
know that?
THE ZEPPELIN.
Bitterly significant for the Gerhogs was
the Berlin official version of the fighting in
Northern France during the first week in
March:—
We began attacks for the recapture of Neuve
Chapelle, but they had to be discontinued owing to
the superior English forces present.
In short, “General French’s contemptible
little army,” which a supercilious Kaiser
told his hosts to “walk over” eight months
ago, was in the way !
In Tasmania Labor hasn’t a single repre-
sentative in the Leg. Council. Therefore one
of the Fat section acts as an honorary Min-
ister and sees, without emotion, most Labor
measures receive the boot. At the forthcom-
ing Council elections the party is going to
make a try to get a leg in, and Bond, the
extra-stout Tory who misrepresents the capi-
tal in the House where mangling is done, will
have to fight for his seat. Dwyer Gray, edi-
tor of the Labor daily, may be Labor’s
nominee, but the undemocratic franchise of
the Council will be mighty hard to beat.
Prime Minister Fisher, after pronouncing
in favor of a “strategic railway” from S. Aus.
to his own ash-barrel, mentioning the cost
and talking copiously about the commercial
benefits of the line, has now sent a sur-
veyor to make a flying trip over the route.
The purpose of this is “to get reliable data
about the country.” Which suggests that
the data Fisher has been going on is en-
titled to great disrespect.
Heaven itself can scarcely know all the
neglected promises that politicians of the
Holman-Hall brand can excuse on account
of the war. After informing a deputation
that he intended to redeem an old under-
taking to alter the liquor law regarding
Christmas Day and Good Friday (his inten-
tion being to allow pubs to be open for a
few hours with drinking on the premises,
instead of nearly all day with drinking on
the pavement), Hall added: —
Owing- to the outbreak of the war and the existence
of the political truce, he had had no opportunity of
giving effect to his promise.
Of course. Wade would have howled, and
the Federal Government would have been
embarrassed in its 1 loan negotiations, and
Woodrow Wilson might even have been so
agitated as to forget to wish the Kaiser
many happy returns of Der Tag.
A Bavarian, Yon Heigel by name, has
been trying to account for the fact that Hog-
many has so few friends. He finds the fol-
lowing reasons: (1) Germany did not like
to lend money to other countries; (2) it did
not interest itself enough in the manipula-
tion of the foreign press; (3) its people have
certain peculiarities of manner which have
prejudiced other folks against them. Cer-
tainly to hear the average German eat soup
is injurious to a delicate appetite; but the
German wasn’t hated for that reason. In
point of fact, he wasn’t hated at all unMl.
by his dealings with Belgium, he proved him-
self to be a savage.
Every day the war is showing up anew
hole in the importing idea. The farriers
are now complaining of the increase in the
price of trade necessities. Australia has all
the materials to make the goods, but they
have been sent away in a raw state, mostly
to potential enemies; and now some of the
potential enemies are actual enemies and
war has knocked the trade right out. If
Australians had been more self-reliant in
time of peace, a lot of them would have
been saved a deal of anguish in time of war.
A Melbourne importer who was lately
fined £2OO for trading with the enemy was
actually endeavoring to give work to Ger-
man factories at the very time that the
Huns were smashing Belgian workshops and
trying to destroy those of Britain. He
pleaded that he didn’t know it was wrong
for a person in Australia or England to
trade through a neutral in German goods
provided he did not trade with a person in
au enemy country. With such men in
business, what hope has Australia of keep-
ing out German goods after the war except
by a prohibitive tariff?
This precious law of supply and demand,
which mustn’t be interfered with on any
account, would be more worthy of respect
if it wasn’t so one-eyed. For instance, the
other day a Master Tanners’ Association
complained to Customs Minister Tudor
about the prohibition of the export of
leather, and said that unless it was removed
they “would have to close their tanneries
owing to the congestion of stocks which
they cannot sell.” Now if, as they aver,
the supply of leather has overtaken and
leaped ahead of the demand, how is it that,
in Melbourne, at any rate, leather of nearly
all sorts is almost double the price it was
nine months ago?
From “The Pariah,” who was long-time
a foreign devil: —
That Bulletin paragraph (18/3/T5) which speaks
about Yuan Shih liai unanimously electing himself
President of China for life, with the right of nomi-
nating his successor, doesn’t tell of the old man’s
great foxiness. Eighteen months ago Yuan sent out
invitations to most of the leading Republicans abroad
to visit Pekin and help him frame anew constitu-
tion. Many—including several of the best-known
Chinese diplomats—accepted, and headed for Pekin.
Sun Yat Sen (who made the revolution) and a few
others pleaded that they had to see a man about a
dog, and are glad now. Those who went to Pekin
found the way-out locked and the key mislaid.
Having surrounded himself with his own supporters,
he appointed the ardent Republicans to “important’’
posts in out-of-the-way provinces, or in Heaven, or
in prison, and then made his announcement. But the
patience eternal of the Orient! Speaking to me.
recently a Chinese visitor of much tonnage in his
own country remarked: “P’raps a hunnerd year now,
but bimeby Republic come.”
Marinoa inspects the Capital of a Con-
tinent again :
No pomp and circumstance at the capital site these
days. On the roads, dust over your boots; as well
look for ice-cream as for a blade of grass. Quean-
beyan brightened up for a time when work com-
menced, but has since abandoned itself to a deep
pessimism. It’s just a little, prematurely old, up-
country town—a place of busted hopes. Even the
monument erected by Kink O’Malley seems to have
the pip. And all the time a hundred or so navvies
are trying to magnify the Cotter trickle into a
stream. It looks as like unto a river as an alderman
does to a mermaid.
While the N. S. Wales Labor Government
proposes to go in for State bakeries to reduce
the cost of living, Scaddan, the Westralian
Labor Premier, is considering State under-
takeries to reduce the cost of dying. The
present charges in the West are so extra-
vagant that many people hesitate about tak-
ing the plunge; and Hapless Jack evidently
reckons he has got the country into such a
mess that no obstacle should be placed in
the way of those who want to get out.
HIS NERVE.
Advices from Washington state that public opinion
has been strongly aroused by the sinking of the
American ship William Fry by the Prinz Eitel
Friedrich. The latter has arrived at Newport for
repairs.— Cable.
U.S.: “Huh' He blackens my eye , and then
goes to my nurse to get his hand fixed tip.”
The Germans have started to build a
strategic railway in Ihe south-west of
Poland. The Russians will, in due course,
complete the good work.
What will happen after the war was
foreshadowed, in a tender for plate rails
lately made to Port Melbourne Council.
The tenderers were a Dutch firm, but the
rails had been made in Germany. They
had been imported to the Commonwealth
before the war began, and the Dutchmen
offered the goods at a “greatly reduced
price.” The mostly-Labor councillors of
the Port declined them with a view to get-
ting an Australian or British tender. But
how many councils of “business” men will
resist the inducement of a “greatly reduced
price” when peace has removed the legal
objection to dealing with the Gerliogs?
The best thing yet said in favor. of
Attorney-General Hall's scheme for nation-
alising the bread business ill N. S. Wales
came from the man who proposed the
motion of condemnation at the Operative
Bakers’ Union. “State baking,” he said,
“would mean that five out of six men at
present employed in the trade would be
dispensed with, and just now to add to the
unemployed would be a serious matter.”
But it is a much more serious matter that
hundreds of thousands of people should be
paying six men to do one man’s work. No
wonder the country is pawning the young-
ster’s future in order to buy its tucker!
JOHN BLLL STARTS ANOTHER
ARMY.
A Bill has passed both Houses of the British
Parliament applying the Defence of the Realm Act
to all factories. The Chancellor of the Exchequer
said that the Government intended to organise The
whole of the engineering community for the purpose
of increasing the output.— Cable.
/
The adventures, as told in the London
Daily Mail, of an Australian farmer who,
travelling in Germany last May, got live
months’ “hard” for punching a Gerhog who
jumped his railway seat, make cheerful
reading. He naturally learnt little of the
war, but a good deal about German gaols.
He was kept busy first at making buttons,
then at constructing lead soldiers, both lines
for the English and “colonial” markets.
The new Australian duty on foreign buttons
is 10 per cent.!
THE EMBLEMS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The spirit of a nation usually bears some resem-
blance to its heraldic emblems. —Daily paper.
Andrew Fisher says he has no hope of seeing uni-
form railway gauges in Australia within the next 10
or 15 years. —Lamentable fact.
Wild eagles flying down a shot-rent sky ;
A lion raging with uplifted paw ;
; A shaggy bear with death in every claw —
These were the signs that made our peace a lie.
flans, toiling in his ganden by (lie Rhino.
The svyeat of ages on his honest face,
Looked up and saw the emblem of his race
Beak-red above the beetroot and (lie vine.
John Smith, his leather apron on his thigh,
Bent to the glowing of his furnace flame.
He knew the emblem of his race and name—
A beast of prey with slaughter in its eye.
Ivan, serf-weary with long toil and care.
Wresting a bitter crust from haggard land,
Leaned on his hoe with gnarled and crooked hand,
Smiling to think his emblem was the bear.
And when along the world the war-blast blew.
The wild things, leaping from the den and cage
Of humble toil, began to tear and rage,
Fierce as the taloned emblems that they knew.
Eagle and bear and lion in their pride
Made carrion waste of the long dreams of men ;
The music failed in tears, the conquering pen
Was but hate’s harlot till the swords were dried.
But we, who from Australia’s farm-and shop
Flaunt as our nation’s crest the kangaroo,
When war-drums throb and troop-trains can’t come
through,
Must from our broken gauges learn to hop.
And when about our homes the war-bolts hail,
And blackened cities to the thunder reel,
Slack statesmen who denied us steam and wheel
Shall bid us trust the prowess of our tail!

PINPRICKS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A man in pyjamas is running the thousand and one
details of the' French Army. General Joffre is at
the head. General Bertholet, Chief of Staff, does the
actual work.
Every time a bridge is blown up or a pontoon has
been thrown across a stream, or a food convoy shifts,
General Bertholet gets up and moves his pins to
indicate the change. Nothing; happens along the
200-mile battle-line but that General Bertholet, still
in pyjamas, leaps from his bed and changes the
pins on the map. —War item.
He hardly knows the trenches
Where Piou Pious lean,'
And frost and damp and stenches,
Are part of the routine;
He sits in bright pyjamas,
Behind the battle’s din—•
The greatest of all dramas
He’s writing with a pin.
Each day he tells the story
By pinholes on the map,
Recording tactics gory I
And tangled bits of scrap ;
He never gets excited ;
When armies lose or win,
The tell-tale map is righted
With one more little pin.
And while he writes the story
la flapping night attire,
His comrades win the glory
Along the line of fire; f
So while their field guns batter
He tracks them with a pin—
And pinpricks yet will scatter
The foemen to Berlin!

SPORTING
NOTIONS
A move is likely to be made at the P.L.L.
Conference —it will reflect itself in Parliament—to
sidetrack the demand for the totalisator in N.S.W.
it will be pointed out that a State lottery, not the
tote, is the thing to save the country, and while
alleged converts to the lottery idea argue the matter
out with one another and make bitter remarks, the
wowser-McMoses alliance will vote solidly and pie-
vail. At least, that is in prospect. But though the
advocates of the clean tote should object to anything
else being tacked on to it, there may amidst the up-
roar arise a feeling that, after all, a State lottery
plus the totalisator would not be bad business; in
which case there would be great sorrow among the
Noses ; ! and delegates to the Methodist Conference of
South Aus., who “deplored the repeated attempts to
legalise'the totalisator in Victoria and N. S. Wales,’
would deplore some more. * #
“S. Gazer”: My friend McMoses started
his mare for the first time. It was the 13th of the
month. X remarked to him that this was unlucky ; the
animal might have fallen and broken J’er neck.
“Broken her neck!” he cried bitterly. “Slie nearly
did worse than that—the rotter nearly won!”

V.R.C. go one better and arrange for a seasoned
aviator who never bets to glide along just over the
horses’ heads and signal any pulling or bustling ?
James Scobie, the Flemington (Vic.)
trainer,! has had an experience which reads like a
page from Nat Gould. About three o’clock one
morning he heard a sound of hoof beats on cobble
stones. He didn’t pay much attention at the moment,
but on: getting up was amazed to find that the
Wallace: mare Orvieto, a six-year-old chestnut owned
by .T. V. Smith, of Bundoora Park, and valued at
,£looo,' had disappeared from the stable. He quickly
’phoned; the news to the police, and about nine
o’clock the same morning an alert John Hop, at
North Melbourne, noticed a man shouting a horse a
drink at a trough. Thinking the animal answered
the description of Orvieto, the constable questioned
the rider, and not having his suspicions lulled, sug-
gested an excursion to the police-station. The rider
agreed, but when near that public utility attempted
to bolt. He was nipped in the act, Scobie was
called, and there was a happy re-union.
Jockey A. Cab in an has had a monopoly
of the “big events” in this season’s Australian rac-
ing, and in six months has ridden the winners of
the Metrop., Gimcraek Stakes, Futurity Stakes, Aus-
tralian Cup, Bond Cup aud Rosehill Cup. He is an
apprentice in Kelso’s stable (Sydney), and is the'
most promising lightweight at present in the Aus-
tralian saddling paddocks.

Henri Demlin, of Belgium, and Frank
Loughrey, of the ILS.A., battled furiously at Sydney
Stadium on Saturday, " and after the'twentieth colli-
sion the referee decided in favor of the Belgian. The
grief of the Yankee corner was profound, and Loughrey
himself seemed more affected by this rather dubi-
ous ruling than if he had been presented with a
woodener on the jaw. It was a mighty close thing
to judge, and Demlin had very little the best of it;
but, in any case, so far as Loughrey is concerned,
the idiosyncrasies of referees matter nothing, for
whether he wins or loses his performances are equally
meritorious. Such a genuine battler is Loughrey,
such a glutton for punishment, that adverse verdicts
have not the slightest effect on his reputation with
the crowd, and the public will be quite as anxious
to see him again as if the judgment of Saturday had
been reversed. It was a willing, earnest mill. Dem-
lin, who naturally enough carried the popular sympa-
thies, showed himself to be both a good boxer and
a rugged fighter, able to give as well as to receive.
He met Loughrey on his own ground, and if it
cannot truthfully be said that be out-fought him he
certainly out-boxed him. It was this that won him
the frav. He showed rather more grit than any
Continental pug previously staged at the Stadium, and
properly matched will leave a creditable record when
(he day ecmes for him to rush home again to help
biff Hans and Fritz out of Flanders.

Herb McCoy, by getting a points’ decision
over our Hebrew brother, Abe Attell, at Melbourne
on Saturday night, is entitled to a little crow, for
Abe is certainly a warrior. The scalps at his belt
run to dozens, and include some stalwart ring
Indians., He has to credit draws with Owen Moran
over 25 rounds, and Battling Nelson over 15, and
once he kept company with Freddie Welsh for 15
rounds. The last-named prince of the glove won the
fight, but Abe showed up a" fairly select line of
sioush. The scrap on Saturday night went the
usual 20 rounds, ar.d the referee’s decision in favor
of the Australian was not received in the spirit
which should distinguish Christian brotherhood. It
never is. The ring master explained that the
descendant of Jerusalem lost points by striking with
the open glove.

-“ Cauliflower Nose”: Some of the fine
boxing' talent the Australasian contingents brought with
them to Egypt has been getting to work in this Land
pf Plagues. In a tournament at the camp by the
Pyramids between Maorilanders and Australians those
fine stoush traders, Bartlett, Woods, Chas. McQuarrie
and Matthewson, of M.L., put it all over big brother.
Porehani; the M.L. welter-weight, was beaten by a
welter from Melbourne, but he was the only Ricketty
Islander 1 to have his colors lowered in the series
of scraps. Bartlett, who was recently heavyweight
champion of M.L.', is reckoned to be the best glove
fighter in Cairo at present, and he has a standing
challenge out to all Egypt for a fight of any length
for any ©ld prize from a pint of sherbet upwards.

Australia’s champion mermaid, Fanny
l)nrack (N.S.W.), continues to improve on herself.
Twelve months ago, at Sydney, she made the world’s
time for the 150yds.—lrnin. 55sec. On Saturday, at
Coogee, she won the 150yds. championship (ladies’)
qf the State in Imin. 54 l-ssec. She now holds
World records for the 50, 75, 100. 110, 150, 200,
220 and 300 yards, 100 metres, 300 metres, 440yds.,
880yds. and mile. Really, her name should be

Maoriland has been having a feast of swim-

and the U.S. swimmer Cunlia. Auckland, where
the Hawaiian was less affected by the chill of the

was there he clipped the time for the 50yds. from
28 2-ssec. (his own) to 22 3-ssec

The inevitable struggles for champion
honor and glory amongst Sydney's many surf-bathing
clubs commenced on Saturday at Bondi; but the
weather-man was thinking of something else when he
served out the conditions. A heavy south-east wind
tore across the chest of the beach, and the surf was
not only unsuitable but dangerous. The undertow was
bent on mischief, and only by skill and prompti-
tude was it once or twice prevented from making a
German of itself. About 700 surfers from Ooc-ee,
Manly, Bondi, Dee Why, North Steyne, Cloveiiy,
I reshwater, Cronulla and Cook’s Hill lined up and
argued the point on the beach and in the surf, and
a comfortable feeling was instilled in the onlooker
that so long as any of Australia’s tanned ocean-edge
teams are handy when Davy Jones is eloping with
him (or her), the action will be cordially and expe-
ditiously resented. No finer life-saving crews could
be found in the world than those which have
developed with Sydney’s most popular sport. The
Pennant championship (rescue and resuscitation)
was won by Bondi with 114 points; Cook’s Hill (111)
second, Coogee (110) third. The surf race was a
severe test owing to the heavy seas, and G. Brown
(Bondi), the last of the only four to complete the
journey, was declared winner on the ground that
none of the others had fulfilled the conditions. He,
as did all the Bondi men, had the advantage of
understanding the tricks of the local currents. Cron-
ulla won the alarm reel race, and North Steyvie
the 440yds. flag relay race. The novice alarm reel
race went Manly’s way, and the tug-of-war to Dee
Why,
THORPE.
The summer ’ball season was shut off on
Saturday at Sydney with a match between Australian
and United States nines, although the great game on
the previous week, which landed the championship
on Sydney Club’s peg, was the end of the section to
all intents and purposes. But for the leader of the
Legislative Council, Fred Flowers, the match between
Australia and U.S. would by now have been old
bones. It was first staged as part of a patriotic
carnival some weeks back, but mis-hit balls, reaching
a stand and colliding with electors, drove. a scan-
dalised politician into the field with a command to
“stop this dashed silly game.” Naturally, the oblig-
ing players pulled their freight. On Saturday, Uncle
Sam’s delegates were beaten after “some ’ball play”
(as they phrased it) by 8 to 6.
The commencement of winter baseball is now close
up, and had it not been for the war the season
would have been momentous in the history of the
game in Australia. There need be no doubts that
the great U.S. game is going to shake a powerful
challenge at other field games for public favor. It
has everything that the alert Australian hankers for
in his sport—speed, daring, cunning, and the excitement
of great risk-taking to win an advantage. In the few
years that it has been played in the Commonwealth
it has gained a remarkable hold, and as it becomes
better understood is bound to have a prominent place.
Tn 1906, at Melbourne, : during a dinner given to the
’ball team of the Yankee warship Baltimore, Major
Wardill, Australia’s most experienced cricket mana-
ger, said, by way of prophecy: “In my opinion,
baseball is destined to become the most popular game
of the future in Australia. A game which is played
in a couple of hours, and is full of ‘go,’ is what
people want. In that respect, especially, baseball
contrasts favorably with cricket, which is protracted
to an undue extent, and, in consequence, becomes
tiresome to all but expert enthusiasts.” How far that
propheev will be fulfilled is. of course, hidden; but
this much is certain—though it doesn’t know where
it’s going, like the jnigger, it’s on its way.
The Bulletin has been having some
friendly talk with Buttan Singh, formerly the cham-
pion wrestler in Australia. Some time ago a Hindoo
was arrested in Victoria and charged with shooting'
a woman and her children. It was said at the time
that it was Buttan Singh. The Bulletin accepted
the story for a week: then friends of the old Sikh
arose to say that the man in custody couldn’t be
the ancient athlete, and The Bulletin located him
in the West. From there he has been heard from;
he is travelling the country, flourishing as a hawker,
and, in spite of his years, still capable of doing
wonderful things on the mat. Of course he had
nothing to do with the Victorian shooting affair.

Amateur A. F. Thorpe, whose speed on the
track has put him ahead of anything in trunks
in N. S. Wales, got away with the much-valued
Cardinal’s Cup at the St. Patrick’s Day sports at
Sydney on Saturday. With a handicap of sJyds. it
looked a moral for him, although middle distance
is his long suit. He dashed to the tape pursued
by .T. J. Walsh, a yard and a half behind, in Tosec_
dead.
There is soc;e isiik in MaorHand of trying
to lure Bergraeiec, „ is reported to be after the
world’s half-ire'’' cord. over to the Pawned
Dominion ana „ .atoning him over that distance
with W. F. Trsmbath and V Vi. Dormer, the best
middle-distance professional peds. in M.L. Trem-
bath, now retired, but liable to attempt to “come
back” at any moment if sufficient cash is jingled in
his hearing, has made the distance on grass in lmin.
55 4-ssoe., while Dormer’s best effort was lmin.
58 l-Csec. That was as an amateur. If Bergmeier,
Trembath and Dormer can be brought together in
a match over tn.ee distances —600yds., 880yds. and
1000yds.—-something extra special should be wit-
nessed.

Gordon Perrot, of Westralia, who recently
shook off the dust of Cambridge ’Varsity (Eng.)
and pitched a tent in Sydney, has an imposing
athletic record. Last year he was in 23 foot races
and ran into a place every time. His most starry
effort was the defeat of W R. Applegarth (then
English amateur champion and now world’s profes-
sional champion through defeating Jack Donaldson)
in a 100yds. scratch event ia 10 3-ssec. Maybe
Perrot will add a tonic to the life of amateur
athletics in the Ma State. T’hev’re sick for it.

A. B. Post \ * he is the speediest profes-

this time matched against E. Carter, for “the short
sprint championship of the world” (50, 60 and
75 yard? Upwards of 10 years ago, Postle, then
in V, held the Australian championship;
Dim in more recent years Jack Donaldson, of Vic-
toria, left him lagging. The tests will take place
at Melbourne next month.
Jack Donaldson had a birthday this month —his
29th. His old opponent, Postle, is 33.
Victorian bowlers have finished their three
principal competitions, just in time to allow the suy*-
plementary games to be concluded before closing
down for the season. The premier club for the
year is Armadale, the hospitable but teetotal institu-
tion founded with the stipulation that the
day any player upon the premises sipped
the wine that is red or guzzled • the beer that
is brown, up must go the shutters. These stipula-
tions have been adhered to, except on one or two
special occasions. Nevertheless, visitors always look
forward to a dvy at Armadale, where they are sure
cf a. genuine we come and a good game.

There were two stirring races on the Yarra
on Saturday, when the champion amateur eights and
single sculls were fought out.; The latter
miles) was a hard battle against wind and tide,
and B. G. T. Kelly won it by sheer pluck after
appearing to be a defeated rower. At one stage his
hands burned and dried so much that he had to soak
them; but he-gripped up again, and, although he
had the worst of the water, drove his shell past the
mark a few feet ahead of his only opponent, C.
Collyer. In the circumstances, the time, 18min.
37sec., was good business. The eights championship
was won by Albert Park from five others in 14min.
37 2-ssec. The winners were the superior watermen,
and this secured them the victory from Corio Bay
by about a yard. Albert Park has hold pride of
place on the river unbrckenly since' 1900.
Tasmania also got off its eight-oar champion-
ship on Saturday, on the Tama..-, the course being
three miles (half a mile further, than the Victorian
course). North Esk (Launceston) won from the
Mercantile crew (Hobart) in
much in the way of a. race, but as a procession it
was picturesque. The champion sculls will be decided
later on the Derwent.
* * *
The talked-of mat<h between Alf Felton
and Charlie Towns is not likely to get further than
conversation unless mere than. £IOO a . side ,is the
stake. Felton .reckons. that only £4O out of the
£IOO is profit, and to earn that much wealth eight
or 10 weeks' work are required. With a stake of
£250 or even. £2OO a man can scrape a crust out
of it.
The sculling match between Webb and
Hannon for the supremacy of Maoriland is still more
of a rumor than a certainty. It is supposed to be
pulled off some time in May on, the Wanganui; but,
although Hannon is training like a man pursued
by tea Dogs of Fate, Webb hasn’t touched an oar
y * l. His latest excuse is that the challenger has
only deposited £25, and William of Webbanui wants
to see the glitter cf £SO before he begins to work.
When the mail left Harmon was hunting for the
extra £25 with a divining rod and two bloodhounds.
The records of Great Public Schools on the
cricket field were rubbed out by Melbourne Grammar
School last week in a match against Geelong College.
Batting first, the former team scored 961, of whmh
J. C. Sharp made 506 not out —both records for the
world in the grade. The former highest G.P.S. in-
dividual score was 412, made by O. H. Dean, of
Sydney Church cf England Grammar School, to the
discomfort of Newington College, in 1904-5; and the
most numerous score by a G.P.S. team was 916, piled
up by Sydney Grammar against Sydney Church of
England Grammar in 1908-D. In the Melbourne
Grammar School-Geelong College fatality the latter
w..s obliterated bv an innings: and 659 runs. That’s
another record, or ought to be.
Another pyramid of rims in a Great Pub-
lic School match was compelled by Newington College
against Sydney High Scb.ool last week. It was a
game decided —very nmcii decided —upon a single
innings each. The High school scored 101 ; Newing-
ton made 600 for eight wickets. Of these latter,
J. M. Taylor, who found /a place in Ma’s XI during
the Sheffield Shield matches, knocked up 293, and
R. F. Cripps 13C ui.o.).
The best score in. Sidney first-grade cricket
last Saturday was 1.46 by Warren Bardsley
for Glebe against Waverley. It was a vigorous ex-
hibition, and chanceless until 115 had been reached.
M. A. Noble keeps up with the procession. Play-
ing for Paddington against Petersham (Sydney) he
howled three men, caught and howled two, and
caught another off a pal’s bowling. Five for 36 was
his average with the ball.
Central Cumberland (Sydney) had a lively inning
on Saturday against Redfern in the second-grade
competition. It made 39 runs, 12 of which were by
Ritchie and 12 by old Sundries. Six bats returned
without a run, and the two bowlers employed in the
work of destruction secured five for 15 and loui
12.
Nil was a conspicuous figure in the \Vaverley-
Glebe first-grade match. When play closed aver-
lev’s first-inning ledger read thus:
J. Flynn, c. Taylor, b. Cullen .. . - 0
C. C. O’Connor, not out • • . . u
C. Sheppard, b. Cullen .. .. 1 ’
S. E. Gregory, not out . . • • • • 0
Two wickets for .. •. .. 0
Fall: 0, 0.
Cullen, 2 for 0.
The brisk fight that was expected between
University and North Sydney on Saturday commenced
tamely, and the latter at this distance appears a good
bet. This is the third time these teams have met.
Twice no verdict could be given, and the evenness
of play has confounded tipsters. University was
weakened on Saturday by the loss of Roy Min nett
(off to the Front) and Lamrock. The first innings
produced only 141 runs, US of which were made
by four bats. Moore’s bowling put five men out, ot
action for 42 runs. When stumps were painlessly
extracted North Sydney’s score-sheet showed 127, for
three wickets. These were collected in Turn in. in a
light that was no friend to batsmen.
Wicket-keeper lioxsliall, one of Maori-
land’s best-known cricketers, has retired after nearly
20 years’ fine play. He went to Christchurch from
Victoria and his brilliant stick-minding hurried
him into the Canterbury representative eleven. Since
then only on one occasion was he not the stumper
for the team. That. was in 1903, and the mistake
was never repeated. Twice he visited-Australia with
M. rep. elevens, and some judges reckoned his
work behind the sticks as good as any in the Com-
monwealth.
* * * *
Sydney Uni.’s team, which has been strong
enough in' recent years to keen the club near the top
of the First-Grade Competition, has been depleted by
the recent medical exams. Barbour, Gregg and
Stack, all inter-State men, have graduated as M.B.’s.
Barbour goes to Toowoomba (Q.), where his father,
G. P. Barbour (the old Sydney ’Varsity Blue), runs
the- local Grammar School. Eric Barbour has a medi-
cal appointment handy. Gregg and Stack go to the
Front to help with the wounded. The team’s brilliant
bowler, R. J. A. Massie, is already there, hut at
the business end of the fighting. There will be plenty
of room for promising recruits in the University side
next season.

Victorian tennis is stronger than that of
South Aus., but it cannot afford to send over to
Adelaide just any sort of a team, and the local men
were all over the six Victoria this
time. The horrible total wgs 17 rubbers to four in
favor of S.A. But the Women’s match was as bad
the other way—11 to one in favor of Vic. The soli-
tary one went to the racquet of Miss Parr, who was
the best lady player in Adelaide before a lot of to-
day’s players were born.
The first team of tennis players to visit.
N. S. Wales from Tasipapii is expected in April.
It will include the island’s champion.
The result of the Maoriland Amateur ath-
letic championship meeting was to lea re the Challenge
Shield in the whare of the Wellington centre. Otago,
Southland, Canterbury and Aucklard followed in that
order. Auckland, which was weakly represented, didn’t
score a solitary point. As was expected, Australasian
champion “Jimmy” Beatson ran aivay with the long-dis-
tance trophies. He went over the mile in 4min. 36see.,
and the three miles in 15min. . 4 l-5sec, Both times
are not nearly up to MaoritandV Vest, 4min. 18sec.
and 14min. 49sec. respectively. Another Australasian
champion, W. J. McHolrn, the hammer pitcher, was
below form. He landed the implement ,135ft. 6in.
from the circle:, ..whereas-his-record throw measured
up at 147ft. 51in.

The movement fb amalgamate League
Rugby and Australian Rules football in Australia
is not flourishing. When the scheme was considered
in conference at Melbourne last November," it was
heralded as a sure thing ; but the longer each section
ponders over the ground which it is necessary to
give away, the tougher the problem becomes. The
Australian Rulers have notified that the new articles
will have to be modelled to their liking, and now
League secretary H. R. Miller exudes the informa-
lion that “players- and public generally can rest
assured that the executive is not going to do any-
thing to jeopardise the League.” That is where
the innovation stands or totters at present, and it is
gradually becoming less coherent in its language.
* * * *
Hockey, like other field games, will be on
a reduced scale during the coming winter. In Syd-
ney the pastime has flourished a little more with each
Jack Frost season during the past five years, and had
almost reached the stage when it could look for an
enclosed ground and a “gate,” when the war yell
was . loosed and the ensuing stampede of athletes
knocked the stuffing out of its immediate prospects.
During March the Vic. Government shipped
to the Panama Exhibition beautiful samples
of Australian products in the shape of a
marble court, with pillars, pedestals, etc.
The court is in dark-grey and dove-colored
diamonds, and the pedestals of exceptionally
beautiful pink and white marbles, from
Buchan and Limestone Creek, near Omeo,
Gippsland, where there is an unlimited and
easily-quarried supply. Nobody knows exactly
why the exhibit is being sent; but if the
intention is to foster an export trade it will
tax Alfred Deakin’s ingenuity to answer
Uncle Sam’s questions and explain why,
with such valuable and beautiful rocks on
its premises, the Commonwealth should last
year have imported a quarter of a million
pounds’ worth_ of inferior stone. The only
possible plea in the circumstances will be
insanity.
The drought is giving Yaneo, the X. S.
Wales Government’s big Western irrigation
settlement, a rare start. Most such settle-
ments have to depend on the very gradual
vine and fruit tree, and the pione er settlers
genera'iy run out of cash long before they
puli choir first crop. Yanco has planted
vines and fruit trees, too; but while these
are growing it. is. so to speak, filling its pot
wit!', lucerne. In past bad years N. S.
Wales fodder has been drawn from S. Aus.
and Victoria. This year those States are
worse off than X. S. Wales, wherefore green
1 xcerne has been fetching as much as £7 per
t in at Yanco—-and it doesn’t take much
green lucerne to make a ton. Tens of
thousands of sheep which were trucked from
tiie Central and Central-West to New Eng-
land and the mountains have now eaten out
their grass, and there is still none in the
places they came from; so, as the lucerne
flats can’t keep them all going, there is talk
of imploring the tiger Sosh to be a Good
Samaritan once more and arrange for ship-
ments of corn from SVYrica. Incidentally,
the idea was broached last week to the
Federal Government that the before-men-
tioned tiger might be a Better Samaritan if
the troopships were allowed to ea'i in at the
Cape on their way back and load up with
something to keep our mutton and working
stock alive.

Last S< nate election Gregor McGregor's
untimefly death, shortly before the poll was
taken, thnnv the party system out of gear;
and Laban 1 supporters, to make the ballot
papers vajlid, had to east a vote for a Lib-
eral! candi date. It was a staggering neces-
sity, and the howl that something would
have to Ibe done about it nearly blew the
weitkin through the roof. To Senator Rus-
sell (S.Ai.) was handed the job of finding a
rennwly for such a state of affairs. His
proposal :is that, in the event of a candidate
dying' between nomination and election days,
his o-fficia 1 nominators shall have the right
to select another starter. Prime Minister
Fisher , is enamored of this scheme and pro-
mises nee essary legislation; but it has obvi-
ous deAedcs. In the event of a death, a can-
didate’s! nominators would have matters in
their own hands, and a mobilisation like
the Labor party, with its elaborate machinery
of leaguve 3, selection ballots, branch nomi-
nations, etc., is bound to shy at such a
proposal. Still, something will have to be
done, otherwise Party might be done. And
that calai nity is of course unthinkable!
The firtst men in Australia wore breeches,
and the .historical records now being pub-
lished by*, the Commonwealth show that it
was the .frugal mind of Governor Hunter
which in .1797 clamored for “trowsers” (or
“trowaers” —spelling optional), then just in-
vented. (They “answer the purpose of
breeches and stockings together,” he assured
tb)e British Government. Socks were . in-
vented later, and wowsers much later still.

A life-saving raft invented by J. B. Adams,

to the bank* of tjie Thames some time ago
and the Board oil' Trade promptly started
making exhaustive tests. But the Board snent
such a long time trying to annihilate the
thing that the) inventor got tired of looking
on and returned to Maoriland. Meantime

At the intersecti on of Glen Huntly and
Ormond roads, near St. Kilda 'Bluff, there
has been great md rtality among motorists.
Half a mile of clear road without houses,
and consequently without children, dogs,
ducks or other impedimenta, tempts the man
in the car to pull ou t all stops and shoot his
bolt; a sudden twist at the crossing does the
rest. The car skids, and winds itself round
an iron standard, apparently erected for the
purpose, and onve of more of the occupants
perish on the spv>t. This lias happened on
three occasions. Minor crashes are almost
daily events, and nobody does anything—
excepting the undertaker. The other Sunday
morning two suburban families in a bunch,
with appliances and mearus for an open-air
picnic, got off the tram at ;Glen Huntly-road.
Said one fond mother to the conductor:
“This is the spot ’Where they has the motor
haccidents. ain’t it?” It was a pilgrimage!
All day long the party picjnicked on the fatal
spot in fond expectation of giving the chil-
dren a treat, and when eventually the acci-
dent did hanpen a Chauffeur was thrown
into the familv circle (and broke one rib. in
addition to spilling the te#a. It was a spec-
tator’s rib that was broken. The tea was
not the chauffeur’s either.
“Quidam” : When vfill otherwise sensible
men get out of the habit of listening to the
vague blather of anciVent derelicts in the
mining line? Over and over again indefinite
balderdash is shown to fie more useful from
a cash-catching point of /view than the accu-
rate, straightforward information of the
modern mining engineer. Tell a shrewd
business man that you have a show assaying
(say) 2dwt., and he will turn away dis-
gusted ; but deal out to him a lot of patter
about “values,” dykes, etc..'and he will often
become interested. Over .and over again
the shark scores, to the dietriment of the
honest prospector, by taking \ otherwise smart
men out, rooting a few dishes from pal-
pably small veins, and representing them as
average samples of perhaps a 20ft. face.. In
nine cases out of 10 the alma tears fail to
notice the deception. And when an honest
sampler makes a systematic investigation
of the proposition, and proves it valueless,
with evidence of his painstaking work before
their eyes, sample marks shewing / across
the lode, costeens cut beneath, the surface
clay, new faces exposed where old ones were
insufficiently opened up. and so on, the
probability is that the ancient fluter gets
away with all the sympathy, and the honest
sampler with all the bad feeling. If people
who indulge in mining speculation would
realise that it is not enough to know that a
mine carries “values,” but that information
as to the dimensions of the values is desir-
able. and that a minute tail of flour gold in
a dish may mean very little, they might
devote a little more attention to getting such
values properly estimated by fire assay, and
incidentally save much money and drive
many undeserving old scoundrels to honest
work. In particular it is time that the
pathetic belief in dish prospect s was. chucked
on to the mullock dump. The dish. is a
useful indicator of free gold,, but until the
imagination of ancient mining sharks is
curbed by law, it is apt to lead to very
.erroneous conclusions.

Sensational Triumph for
De Witts
Man 76 years old
Cured of STONE in the Bladder.
Surgeon amazed —no operation.
Here is one ,of the most sensational
and wonderful cases on record. It is
not an exaggeration, but just the plain
and truthful statement of a very well-
known old English gentleman, seventy-
six years of age, who was cured of
stone in the bladder, without operation,
when almost all hone had been aban-
doned.
About four years ago this old
gentleman—Mr. C. J. Watts is his
name —w a s taken
very ill with severe
pains in the back
and a burn i n g,
aching pain inter-
pally. He suffered
badly from urinary
weakness. He be-
came so ill and the
pain became so bad
that he could not
bend or even turn
in bed. Mont h
after month he
tried all kinds of
advice and so-called
remedies, including
“Kidney Mixtures”
and “Backache
Pill s,” but he
got no relief.
He got steadily
worse, until at the end of four years
he had practically given up all hope
of being cured.
SECOND BOX-CURED.
One day he heard of the wonderful
cures effected by De Witt’s Kidney and
Bladder Pills, and he went to Boots’
shop in Caledonian Road and got a
2s. 9d. box. He finished this box and
commenced on another. Before he had
finished the second box he passed from
the' bladder two large, awful-looking,
rough stones and several small ones,
all covered with sharp-pointed crystals.
This happened on December 30, 1913,
about six o’clock in the morning.
Mr. Watts was so impressed with the
size of these stones, which seems so
extraordinary, that he took them and
showed them to a well-known doctor,
who expressed astonishment that such
stones should have been passed with-
out an operation, and especially by
a man of seventy-six years of age.
Mr. Watts, in writing the proprietors
regarding this wonderful incident,
mm
: .4KW»Xv: :
Mr. C. J. Watts (from photo).
states: —“Many people might doubt the
truth of this letter, but I am well known
in this district, and have only stated the
bare facts. Apart from my own case of
Stone in the Bladder, I have heard of a
lot of cases of Rheumatism, Gout, Back-
ache, Cystitis (Inflammation of the
Bladder), and other Kidney and Blad-
der complaints which have been cured
by De Witt’s Kidney and Bladder Pills.
DE WITT’S ALONE
SAVED HIM.
“I live at 62 Hunt-
ingdon Street, Barns-
bury, N., and if any-
body still doubts that
De Witt’s Kidney and
Bladder Fills really do
cure, let them refer to
me and see for them-
selves, for I certainly
think that others
ought to know of this
marvellous remedy.
“I have heard of
young people being
cured of this painful
complaint, but a
remedy which will
cure a man of 76
years of age is surely
the greatest of all.”
De Witt’s Kid-
ney and Bladder
Pills can be ob-
tained at any of
the branches of Washington H. Soul,
Pattinson & Co., Ltd., Sydney, Long-
more’s The Melbourne Pharmacy,
Bourke Street, Melbourne, and all lead-
ing Chemists at 2/9 and 5/6 per large
box. The 5/6 size is two and a half
times as large as the 2/9 size, and con-
tains enough doses to last you three
weeks.
Try your nearest chemist, but if you
have any. difficulty in obtaining De
Witt’s Pills send the price of the
package required to either of the firms
mentioned above, and the goods will be
sent by return, post free.
To cure Kidney Trouble of any kind
you must positively get rid of the cause
—the poisonous Uric Acid. Remember,
to do this, a real remedy must pass
through the kidneys and the bladder,
and not through the bowels, as most
kidney pills do. When you see the
Urine change to a niuddy bluish color—
a feature which distinguishes De Witt’s
Pills from all others—you know beyond
all doubt that they have put their heal-
ing touch on the right spot—the kidneys
and the bladder. A wonderful pill—
straight to the kidneys—that is the rea-
son why De Witt’s give such amazingly
quick relief—eve»w time. A permanent
cure follows almost in every case.

A Natural Remedy
Time was when disease was thought to be due to the
direct influence of evil spirits, and exorcism and magic
were invoked to cast it out.
Science has taught us wisdom. The evil spirits exist
still. We call them “Disease Germs,” and they also
must be cast out. Once lodged in the stomach or
intestines, fever with its hallucinations, or biliousness with
its aches and pains, is the result.
ENO S FRUIT SALT’
is the approved remedy for driving out disease germs.
Its action is quick and thorough. It clears the intestines,
rouses the torpid liver to new life, stimulates the mucous
membrane to a healthy action, and cleanses and invigorates
the whole digestive tract.
Be prepared for emergencies by always keeping a
bottle in the house.

The Primate of Australia (Archbishop of
Sydney) writes: “The Bishop of Ballarat has
placed the Church of Australia under a further
debt to him in giving up this volume. .. .a
most valuable series of sermons, characterised
by freshness and intellectual vigor.... They
have also a unique value in the Australian
atmosphere of their numerous apt illustrations.
But above all, it is predominantly the
deep, spiritual conviction that breathes through-
out. ...that gives them their power.”

Business. Robbery, etc.
“Quill”: All manner of ways of dodging
work. Sydney police have been considering
the case of a person who, calling himself a
“Mystery man,” set up in business as a
worker of Cures, and did a thriving trade
among the innumerable asses who abound in
this young country. After diagnosing the
trouble , of. patients by getting them to hold a
tube containing water while the mystery man
gazed fixedly at the liquid, one of the fakirs
proceeded to prescribe medicines. One man
who went into the chamber of mystery and
left £lO behind was suffering from defective
eyesight, among other things. The fakir
found out the nature of this affliction in a
few minutes by looking solemnly at the tube
of water, and then told his visitor that if he
at once went back home to the country with
a bottle of medicine he’d be all right. The I
strange thing about the case as it stands is
that this egregious hayseed thought he had
made a good deal until a friend or,relative in-
tervened, and the worker of marvels , was
visited by a couple of detectives Avho wanted
to see how the gqme was worked.
“Boronia”: A measure is being pushed
through the W.A. Legislature, giving a
recently-formed co. a : right to exploit the
“blackboys” and zamia palms : sprouting on
certain Crown lands. From these two vege-
tables, the co. reckons to produce alcohol,
flour, sugar, molasses, varnish, tar, petrol and
other necessary commodities. The co. will
be required to snend £lOOO on plant within
12 months, and a further £5OOO during the
following year. Also it will be called upon to
part up a royalty of Gd. for every ton of raw
product consumed. If that doesn’t obliterate
Scaddan’s amazing deficit there’s no sign of
any other remedy.
' * * *
“Two Seas”: When the N.S.W. Govern-
ment started selling apples, picked and
packed by the forced labor of boys at Mitta-
gong Farm Home, the obstacle to private
growers doing business direct with customers
was soon discovered. Said then Minister ,
Carmichael (chief annle salesman) :
I quite recognise that the great difficulty lies in
the . transit arrangement; but if there -is sufficient
demand I am quite sure that facilities for quick
distribution can be made possible. Quick delivery
is an essential in any scheme dealing with perishable
foods, for it only requires the spoiling of one con-
signment to eat up the saving on half a dozen others.
To the poor devils of private growers who
have, like every other country producer, suf-
fered heavy loss without any redress, owing
to the chaos that exists in respect to trans-
port, this recognition of the difficulty is the
only bright spot in the nebulous Government
scheme for acquiring the business of the pri-
vate growers which the Railway Department
has ruined. Unless Carmichael’s suc-
cessor is concerned only in seeing that the
perishable foods raised by Government cheap
labor are not allowed to rot in the trucks, and
that only pillagers of Government fruit are
chided,, the private growers may have a
chance of regaining some of their lost busi-
ness. Especially if the Ministry gets “quick
delivery” for apples, things may improve,
as it has been shown that the conditions most
favorable to the falling-out-of-the-case disease
is a long detention at a hot and dusty goods-
siding. With a more rapid system of tran-
sit the fruit might have a chance of keeping
ahead of the falling-out germ.
* * * *
“Frayed Cuffs”: Sermons in ads. and
gush in everything! I sent my pathetic
collection of shirts and collars to a new
laundry the other day, and when the parcel
came back I found amongst the cleaned linen
a printed slip beginning, “A man’s person-
ality is his best asset. Appearance is an
important factor, and well-got-up linen an
necessity. Now about collar work”
There is no escape; and if we’d only
listen to half the good advice that is shoved
at . us—-even with our washing—we’d all'be
millionaires and live to be a perfectly healthy
and wretched hundred.
* * * *
The chief agricultural college for S.A. was
established at Roseworthy with a sort of
idea that the farmer who learned his busi-
ness there couldn’t go wrong anywhere.
Though less than 30 miles from Adelaide, it
is in a spot that rain clouds seem to miss,
a J Q< 3 its yearly average is three inches below
the 20 that the city expects. - The hills close
by get 30 and upwards. Last year broke all
low records for the State, except in some
parts of the North. Adelaide had under 11£
inches. Roseworthy got 9.36 inches. Yet
s “ict attention to the scientific side of
wheat farming brought an IIA-bushel crop.
MY LANDLORD.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
My landlord is a dreary man whose boots are never
laced;
His braces hang about his thighs, his hair is combed
in haste;
He mixes holiness with biz; he takes a gloomy view
Of ev’rvthing and whistles while the rent is falling
due.
I see him dimly in the dusk, a man devoid of grace,
Who scatters corn amongst his fowls and potters
round the place ;
if any trifling thing goes wrong, it puts him in a
stew;
But he can raise a whistle when the rent is falling
due.
I do not know what tune he pipes to cheer his
wretched heart,
For most of it is hissing air—he pipes with little
art.
, A normal man would wheeze like that if he were
feeling blue;
My landlord does it gaily when the rent is falling
due.
And, when the joyful hour has struck, we hear his
hungry knock,
And find him writhing on the mat as pleased as one
o’clock ;
He sits upon the efiair’s hard rim with face of
purple hue—
A terrible reminder that the rent has fallen due.
He whistles on from month to month, he potters
round his shed,
With pecking fowls about his feet and angels round
his head ;
He saves his soul so he may go where saints their
harp-strings screw ;
But will he rest in Heaven if no rent is falling due?

IN
BANANA LAND
Home-Secretary Grant is the only bachelor
in the Queensland Ministry.
Bit bv bit Badger’s tentacles grip Bris-
bane’s furthest suburbs, and railway revenue
suffers accordingly. The latest proposition
is to connect the metropolis with Kedclilte by
tram —a scheme that will probably rouse
both wild enthusiasm and ferocious opposi-
tion. Brisbane mistrusts its Local Authori-
ties, and this mistrust is the Tramway Cm. s
sheet-anchor.
Queensland, which has talked of its
“magnificent natural resources for about
half a century without trying to develop
quarter of them, has got a move on in the
matter of cement-making. Till the war
broke out a large proportion of the cement
bought by the State in shiploads came from
Germany, and helping the Kaiser was such
a habit that even the machinery for the new
works was to have arrived from Hamburg.
The disturbance, however, caused the nego-
tiations fof Hun-made plant to be broken
off, and a Sydney firm has been given the
job of supplying the rig-out. The company,
which includes some of the biggest financial
guns about Brisbane, has picked a site at
Darra, about eight miles from the capital,
and the machinery is expected in six 01
eight months. The equipment will be
eapable of turning out 700 tons of cement a
week The cost of works, land, etc., is esti-
mated at £05.000.
“M.G.” on the sugar problem: —
When Rankin • introduced his Bill providing for a.
Board to fix the price of cane, Denham, Rankin S
leader, strangled the infant; and then, to make
things right with the growers, he introduced and
passed a Sugar Works Bill. This provides that,
where the co-operating farmers are able to put up
a third of the estimated cost of a mill, the Denham
of the moment will find the balance on stated terms.
The new works to be built at Childers under this
Act will cost £60,000. An efficient mill capable
of serving a rich and extensive district cannot be
built for less. Tn short, only the farmers of a
district proved and established can get any benefit
from the Act; and the struggling farmers who are
tied to an inefficient or extortionate mill in a less
favored district must go on struggling. The Cane
Price Board’s proposal was vastly better ; though cer-
tainly there were difficulties to be overcome. There
is, for instance, the case of the small and inefficient
mill. Lacking as it is in means of close extraction,
it could not, in many cases, pay above 75 pep cent,
of the price considered fair value for cane at a big
mill. It isn’t fair to say “Oh, but make it pay.”
It must be remembered on behalf of the small mills
that they everywhere have pioneered the industry,
and in this matter pe entitled to consideration.
The question is big and complicated; but the im-
pression is gaining ground that nothing will be quite
satisfactory to the.' growers except the Common-
wealth control of t’lie whole business of milling and
refining. As that looks for the moment im-
practicable the Price Board idea is worth
reviving. Certainly the grower needs some pro-
tection. At present he is ground between the upper
and the nether /wheels—between the workmen on
top and the refining co. below.
The latest importation from U.S.A. is
J. W. Gillette, of Chicago, who replaces
J. S. Badger as manager of Brisbane’s tram
system. Badger, after holding the position
for about 18 years, becomes managing direc-
tor of the co., resident in Queensland. Gil-
lette was for a year president of the
Arkansas Public Utilities Association, com-
prising practically all the tramway, electric
light, gas and water plants in the State.
Gympie people the other day unveiled a
drinking fountain in memory of the late
James Nash, the discoverer of the goldfield.
Nash landed in Queensland in 1858, being
then only 24, and in August, 1867, set out
from Nanango with only a dish, pick, dog
and some rations. It was on October 16 or
the same year that he made hi« find, close
to the sp c where his memorial now stands.
Since that time the output of gold from, the
field has amounted to 3,856,8280 z., valued at
13]j millions sterling. Nash, however, didn’t
die worth anything like that amount.
THE TEMPORARY ABSENTEE.
A report has been circulated at Copenhagen that owing to the necessity for restricting foo d con-
sumtion the German Government intends ordering 5,000,000 Germans who possess independent incomes,
and who are ineligible for service, to leave Germany for neutral countries, and remain there until the
end of the war.— Cable.
GERMAN EXILE: “Must I for et'er banished be?”
K AISER: “Aeh, nein! You may return at der endt of der var ven ve pay der indemnity."
“De Oriel”: Re the Yongala wreck. There
is, or lately was, in Halifax (N.Q.) a beau-
tiful oaken panel with crest of the co.
embossed upon it. This was recovered on
the beach at Lucinda Point, and as it weighs
nearly half a hundred-weight I don’t think
it could have drifted far.
“E. J.C.” concerning a good shepherd :
Parson Roche is the man who discovered that the
Cairns water supply had been “cyanided,” and by his
prompt action saved many lives. He had taken some
of the water, and shortly afterwards cyanide poisoning
symptoms, with which he was familiar, showed them-
selves. He notified the authorities, and on search
being made ljcwt. of cyanide residue was found in
the reservoir. Then the parson lay down and had his
own battle with the poison. He lost nearly two stone
weight, and is now recuperating in the mild climate
of Proserpine. Roche was formerly a worker in the
London slums, and, incidentally, about seven years
back, he buried in a pauper’s grave the man who
wrote “Ora Pro Nobis.” Roche had tried to get old-
time friends to interest themselves in the musician’s
case, but it was all in vain, until Death took a hand.
Then dukes and duchesses rallied round with offers of
a fine funeral, etc. Roche turned them all down;
hut he got the grand choir of St. Paul’s to sing
“Ora Pro Nobis” at the graveside.
The Last Straw.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
One citizen, exhausted, remarked: These strikes
can be carried too far,” and refreshed himself. Daily
paper, reporting the Mt. Morgan beer strike.
His throat was besprinkled with sand.
His lip was a-droop with despair,
His nose’s carbuncle shone out
To show where the grog lit its flare.
He passed by his comrades distraught
And fixed his grim gaze on the bar.
Then murmured (how sadly) :
“This world’s going madly—
These strikes can be carried too far.
His mates —what the deuce did they care
If even he perished of thirst?
’Twould just be a matter for bibulous
chatter
The next time they got on the burst;
He frowned at the car in the street
And swore at the man on the car;
His scowl it grew blacker. >
His fibre grew slacker — /
“These strikes can be carried too tar !
He left us. When next he was seen
The gloom had departed his brow;
His voice had a jubilant ring: -
“Nushin’s wrong wiz zher world, izh
zher now?”
He proffered to fight us en masse,
And put up his hands for a spar.,
And the topers he’d quaffed wi.th
He cheerily laughed with —
“These strikes can be carried too tar .
QUEENSLAND.
PHIL. FLAM.
QUEENSLAND GOSSIP.
Brisbane, March 20, 1915.
My Dear Thargomindah, —
The new Governor and his wife supplied
all the excitement this week. They seem to
be cheerful, sporting, and absolutely, un-
affected souls, quite free from “swank,” and
speak mere English —not the laborious “haw-
haw” of the tourist and the musical-comedy
“artiste” from Manchester. They arrived on
Monday, and were met and welcomed by the
Premier and party aboard the Lucinda. His
Ex., trimmed with brand-new gold braid, and
Mrs. Ex. afterwards boarded Lucinda for
the landing. She wore black crepe de chine,
with a tunic of tambour lace calculated to
rouse the little green imp in sister woman,
and a smart little black and gold hat. There
were no Gentlemen Helps in attendance —
all at the war, I suppose.
Sir Hamilton is keen on horses, and is
looking forward to the arrival of an Irish
filly, bred by himself, which he hopes to see
carrying the eau-de-nil and scarlet of his
racing stable a few lengths ahead of the rest
of the field some fine day at Eagle I arm.
Lady Goold-Adams is an unconvertible horse-
lover, too.
The Matabele war medal, which nestled on
the new Governor’s bosom, was designed by
himself. He objected to a dejected-looking
lion with its tail between) its legs, such as some
of the South African medals displayed, and
after a confab with the late Cecil Rhodes
(who wasn’t late then, by any means) he
produced a beast whirling its narrative amid
some broken Matabele spears. Nothing like
manufacturing your own war medals, my
dear, if you want satisfaction.
A dreadful thing happened at the Kennedy
Wharf, where the party from the Lucinda
landed. His Ex. inspected the guard of
honor, before listening to the Mayoral and
aldermanic oratory. Some of the city papas
“spoke their mind” then and there, and,
later, when the Council met, there was bit-
terness and ruffled whiskers. I’m not an
authority on the etiquette of Governors and
municipal whiskers, so I can’t say who was
in the right. Still. I understand that King
George always inspects the guard of honor
first, but we may be more up-to-date iu Bris-
bane.
On St. Paddy’s Day the Q.T.C. lunched the
vice-royalties, and subsequently exhibited
them in the official box, which was hung
with eau-de-nil and scarlet draperies. After-
wards they were paraded at the Hibernian
Sports. On the previous evening the Irish
Association passed the salt, and for Satur-
day the chef at the Queensland Club is about
to Drepare a piece of good Australian mutton
and damper.
I could go on, my dear, telling you of
many other functions at which we and the
new tenants at Government House have hob-
nobbed, but I refrain. There is no call to
raise further petty jealousy in the South.
The races at Eagle Farm on Wednesday
drew out the largest crowd for many a meet-
ing. Probably two-thirds came to see Sir
But let us avoid that subject. You
know who I mean wore a black and white
frock and a black hat laden with roses.
Mrs. Lukin, always one of our best-enveloped
matrons, Mrs. Gilbert Wilson, Mrs. Arthur
Feez, Mrs. Colonel Lee and Mrs. L. E.
Walker all sported black gowns. Mrs. E. T.
White inhabited a garment thgt took the
palm as the most effective glad array on
view. It was made of biscuit-colored ninon.
and blue-satin veronique. Mrs. Whittirigham
was in king’s blue and black, and Mrs. Call l 1
wore champagne silk, and a hat enhanced
with ostrich moult.
After the races Mr. and Mrs. G, D. Logan
revived a chosen few at their pretty home
Tarranalma, Albion. Mrs. Logan wore cerise
ninon over palest yellow, and Miss Mitch el'
her niece, wore shadow lace, belted with
green, over biscuit color.
Colonel Spencer Browne, of the Courier
has received his marching orders, and is to
command the Light Horse brigade of the
Third Contingent. The Colonel was the first
president of the Queensland branch of the
A.J.A., and northern press folk are very
proud of him.
Journalist Roy Evans, who was doing so
well in London,' has had to leave the Cold
Country, after a tussle with pneumonia.
He arrives in Sydney almost as soon as this
goes forth on its errand of Christian en-
deavor.
Young Victor Bell, of Coochin, has left
for London, to join King Edward’s Horse.
His mother and sisters said good-bye to him
all the way to Adelaide.
Last week Mr. and Mrs. Jesse Paten
stilled the cry of hunger in some dozens of
their friends at the Botanical Gardens kiosk,
in honor of their daughter Winifred, who,
although she has the right to put LL.B. after
her name, decided to get rid even of her
original name, and share another one with
Gordon Andrew Woodyard, _a personable
young man of military profession, who hails
from Melbourne.
One marriage has made glad Miss Emms
Walker, a popular Toowoomba girl, and
Arthur Offner, of Milton; and another has
rejoiced Miss Ward, of Blackall, and Thomas
Hurley, of Brisbane.
Wages Boards can be quaint things. A
family gentleman has just informed me
over the fence —-that the Wages Board has
decreed a rise of Id. an hour, and that, as a
result, he and 14 of his mates are “out of a
job.” The job, by the way, was in a sawmill.
It seems to a mere feminine intellect that
the majority could better afford to do with-
out the extra 4d. a day than the 15 could
dispense with their billets. Maybe the W ages
Board didn’t anticipate the move; maybe, it
was just another of the Fatman’s unpleasant
little ways.
Yours affectionately,
AUSTRALIA JANE.
Woman’s dread of the expense at all times
when she isn’t buying a hat can be blamed
for the death of Louisa Lawson, a Gympie
girl. Intending to return from Ipswich to
a friend’s house three miles away, she
boarded the Sydney-Brisbane express by
mistake. A man would have made up his
mind that, as he wouldn’t be able to get out
till he reached Brisbane, he was anyway
lucky in that he would arrive before the
pubs closed. But Louisa Lawson, with a
vision of money to pay and tightly-pursed
lips, jumped from the carriage as it passed
her destination at 30 miles an hour.. What
happened after that needn’t be gone into.
The Parliamentary jaunt into prickly-
pear land, led by Lands Minister Tolrnie,
produced a good pear-persistency yarn. A
young M.L.A. from Burnett way recalled
how he once told Prime Minister Fisher
that the pear would grow on a wire fence.
“You wouldn’t dare tell ’em that from the
platform,” said the sceptical politician.
“But it’s true,” insisted the M.LA., and he
proved it. Breaking off a piece of pear
without root he hung it from a tree by a
wire hook, and a couple of years later
showed it to doubting Andrew. It then
had added a new leaf and a fruit to the
original fragment. Fresh air is nourish-
ment enough for Queensland’s vegetable
curse.


Why a Motor Tyre Contract
was not Renewed 8
DUNLOP TYRES
run “too far” to purchase on a
Mileage Basis
Read this:—
The Katoomba-Jeno l an Motor Car Service two
years ago contracted to use Dunlop Tyres on their
heavy 2 ton 8-seated Cars —used daily on the
mountainous 94 miles out and back trip to the
Jenolan Caves. The arrangement was that if any
“ Dunlops ” ran less than 3000 miles they received
credit from us for each mile short, and we received
payment for every mile in excess.
■' ...
Here’s the Result “Dunlops”
are still to be used, but are to be
purchased at current list prices. Why ?
Because many of the Covers listed
Retail at £9 ss. each have, on a mile-
age basis, cost the above “ Service”
nearly double the figure they could
have purchased “straightout” at list
price. For some Covers they paid as
high as <£2l 11s. 9d., £2l 3s. Bd.,
£l7 19s. 3d., £l7 12s. 3d., £l6 13s.
9d., £l5 11s. 2d., &c., &c. It’s no
wonder there was no “Renewal”
on a mileage basis. The test proved
the undoubted superiority of
“ Dunlops” for continuous heavy wear
and satisfaction.

DOSSER'S PARADISE.
Homeless and fallen Outcasts,
Mingled with the worst of vice,
Pay a penny for admission
To camp at dosser’s paradise ;
One will tell a pathetic story
Of the ruin and downfall of his Life,
Through failure in his speculations
And the separation from his AVife;
Some coughing wretch will sorely moaneth
And curse the day that he was born,
Sleep it off will growl his neighbor
And see a doctor in the morn ;
Some restless cove will writh and sigheth—
Blime I’m as cold as Ice,
May the evil hound who robbed me
End in dossers’ paradise.

“THE. CHILDREN’S FOOD.”
Justice Powers, of the Federal High Court,
in a judgment respecting the conditions to be
applied to certain work in the Northern
Territory, last week uppercut three ancient
gags. The evidence, he said, showed (1)
that the Territory is fit for Europeans to
live in, (2) that it has not been developed to
any extent by colored labor, and (3) that
since the white workers’ wages had been
raised in 1911 and 1912, the European popu-
lation has increased by 72 per cent. More-
over, Justice Powers found in that way on
evidence which had stood up against cross-
examination for many days. And a precise
statement made by a Judge upon evidence is
usually better worth swallowing than vague
frothings made by a jaundiced belltopper
upon hearsay.
“Bloggs”: Part of the evidence for the
defence in the Earle Hermann case—which
ended in a conviction in Sydney and a sen-
tence of three years’ hard labor —was the
fact that the accused used to “mutter sense-
lessly about Chinese concessions.” The wit-
ness obviously didn’t know that Chinese
Concessions, Ltd., was one of the most
humorous of the Hermann flotations. The
concessions were represented to be the pro-
perty of "a Chinese nobleman.” They con-
sisted of “a million acres in the heart of
China.” The nobleman owned “practically
the whole of the Province of Bang Hi,” and
he was willing to make over the most valu-
able portion of it in consideration of 50,000
shares in the co. A number of cold, hard
business men put their money into the
scheme, though they had never heard the
name of the Mongol aristocrat, though they
did not know where the alleged province
was, and though no details were given as to
the resources or products of the million
acres. On investigation it turned out that
the Chinese concessionaire was a Little
Bourke-street (Melbourne) vegetable dealer
whose total assets were a mortgaged cab-
bage plot. One of the victims was a well-
known Sydney sharebroker. It is when I
learn of these things that I thank Heaven I
am not a cool, hard business main.
“Belial”: The devil to pay, of course, be-
cause the Sydney R.C. Cathedral authorities
want to grab some public land 1 to improve
the look of their tabernacle. The Church is
after part of Cathedral-street an;d a strip of
Phillip Park. What I say—after having
cast a brick at the responsible i parties for
their disingenuous subtlety in manoeuvring
for position, as they have—is, why not?
The cathedral is an eyesore. In almost any
other city the people responsible for it would
have been compelled to finish it a dozen or
more years ago. If it is finished in a half-
hearted way it will remain an eyesore. It
will be better business for the city to make
a sacrifice and get a thing of beauty in
return. It is not as though anything much
was at stake. Cathedral-street will no
longer be used when the new road (which
was built allegedly to provide; an easier
gradient; in reality, no doubt, to stabilise
the position of the Church) is opened to
traffic. And Phillip Park, like all small
parks which are badly tended, is hideous.
Particularly hideous is the top Corner, with
its weedy fig-trees and starved : grass and
grotesque drinking-fountain; and this is the
corner that the Church has its acquisitive
eye on. The tone of the protests against
the Church’s aims is resentment—the re-
sentment of simple folks who have had a
point shown them. This is bad business.
Sydney is not nearly beautiful enough in its
public buildings to be able to afford it. If
the Telegraph and “Orangeman of 30 years’
standing” and the rest get their way, the
Cathedral authorities will be disconcerted
and a quarter of a street which nobody will
presently use and about one-tenth of a park
which is mostly dead fig leaves will be
saved. As against this a cathedral front of
noble proportions, placed in the one part; of
the city from which it can be viewed to the
best advantage, will be lost. The sacrifice
is too big.

'T'O-DAY particular thought should be given to
1 one’s shoes. Definite purpose and not caprice
should rule their choice, since Fashion recog-
nises their dress value and insists that they shall
harmonise with the rest of one’s attire. Thus, by
following the lead of Fashion, a very distinctive
and pleasing note can be attained. Bostocks

Anaemia
Frequently Unrecognised
The Importance of its Detection
The Symptoms of Anaemia (Poorness
of Blood) are Difficulty of Breathing, Lack of
Energy, Depression, Pallor, and Exhaustion after
Slight Exertion. Many people fail to recognise
these symptoms of Anaemia— the disease creeps
on, obtains a firm grip of the system and eventually
becomes chronic. If the symptoms are recognised
at the beginning it is a very simple matter to enrich
the blood and so effectually check the disease.
lroß‘Jenoid£
enrich the blood—renew vitality
After taking Iron ‘Jelloids,’ the blood becomes
enriched and strengthened, the distressing symptoms of
Anaemia quickly disappear, giving place to a state of
vigorous health and buoyant spirits.
DR- ANDREW WILSON wrote : —“ It can be definitely stated
; that Iron ‘ Jelloids ’ constitute the most effective and desirable
“ treatment for Anaemia or Poorness of Blood.”

the late music professor. The sniggering
and the snorting are provoked by the fact
that young Petersen is a cub reporter on the
Argus —a fluffy literary duck whose pen-
feat*hex*s are only just pi-icking, but who
happens to be a protege of Melba’s. The
lady has always had a protege or two on the
premises, and she has always been a most
generous pusher and shover in the interests
of the callow aspirant under her wing. But
it is beyond the powers of the Queen of Song
to impose the judgment of her immature
reporter upon expexfienced authors and
artists. The situation would' be' paralleled
if some well-known writer were to suggest
a big musical effort on the part of Melba
and other foi*emost musicians, and set up
some small-and-early incompetent horn-
blower of his acquaintance to edit Melba’s
trills and generally boss the job.

“Night Owl” : For years the pay of most
country pressmen in Queensland has been
the least the proprietors could get a man
for, while the hours commonly began with
the morning’s court cases and ended when
the pubs were closing. I knew one derelict
(he had been editor of a daily, and was an
M.A.) who got £1 a week, the use of a bunk
on the premises and free copy-paper; also
I knew a man-—since returned to civilisa-
tion —who slung a billet as importer for a
Northern daily and went mending coal-bun-
ftei's for the sake of financial advancement.
General-secretary Bignold, of the A..T.A.,
after finishing conference business in Bris-
bane, took a trip up the coast as far as
Townsville recently, and roped >in every
eligible pressman there and e/i route, bar
.about two. Hitherto the country brother’s
fear of. the sack has blocked organisation :
but Bignold’s heart-to-heart talks with
bosses and men have abated a long-standing
danger to metropolitan pressmen and given
the woi’st-paid of the others something to
hope for.

“Tarbli Ituadh”: Probably the heftiest
physical specimen on the Austi*alian press is
John Mackintosh, of the Argus, who is well
over Gft. long, and as solid as one of his
own leadei-s. Height has always been a
recommendation to editor Cunningham. On
one occasion “Monty” Grover, now editor of
Sydney Sun, but then a member of the
Argus staff - , said in remonstrance: “Look
here, Mr. Cunningham, if I were three inches
taller my screw would be £3 a week higher.”

The lady detective again! On March 4
the motherly S. M. Herald demonstrated
its method of arriving at a conclusion. This
is how:—
A suggestion has been made to Dr. Gilruth for the
military training of half-castes and aborigines.
It is urged that half-castes are the best shots and
most efficient cattle men in the Territory.
The object is to formulate a protest against housing
consumptives at the Rook-wood Asylum.
It is no use trying to deceive this artful old
paper! She knows.
* * * *
A new illustrated monthly magazine is
announced in London. Its title is to be
Khaki, it is to be a news-sheet as well as a
magazine, and it is to be circulated gratui-
tously among the fighting men at the Front.
Its. promoters are “desirous of showing their
appreciation of the sacrifices made by the
men who have rallied to the flag from dis-
tant parts of the Empire.” The financial
responsibility lias been assumed by a syndi-
cate of Australians, Maoi’ilanders, Cana-
dians and British Indians; but the old man
may lend a hand and send in a cheque if he
has a mind to.
* * * #
“Digamma” : A faint buzzing heralds the
arrival of Vol. 1 No. 1 of the Wasp, a penny
Melbourne weekly conducted by one Angus
Francis Turnley. In its “Notice to Con-
tributors” the Insect says: “Jejune jour-
nalists of the Age, Argus and Herald
genus ; beer-bemused bards of the Bulletin
breed; social sycophants of Punch and
Table Talk twaddlesomeness; and degene-
rate derelicts, whose wit is confined to ver-
nacular vulgarity, will lessen the strain on
our W.P.B. by refraining from botheinng us
with their effusions.” The Flea describes
itself as talented, though tiny, and buries
an order for £5 in Yarra Park in order that
the flea-hunt may be rendered exciting for
those who find the cash. “Popular Piffle”
is the heading of one of its columns. But
for the adjective it might be used to include
the whole, lot.

“Pick”: Lionel J. Hurley, of the High
Commissioner’s London office, who has been
helping to keep Australia’s end up among
the motor-ambulance men in Northern
France, was a few years ago on the Inky
Way in N. S. Wales. He is a son of the late
John Hurley,, ex-M.L.A., and founded the
Moruya-Tilba Times. 111-health from an
attack of fever and ague whilst working in
a Celebes mine drove him to the Cold
Country.

Whitechapel, the Jewish quarter in the
East-end of London, is establishing a recoi’d
in ink. Yet another Yiddish daily has just
been born there, making the total up to five.
No . Australian city supports that many
dailies for Jews, Gentiles and sui*f-bathex*s
lumped together.

“Quill”: Quite a lot of people reckon that
to get the straight griffin about the war,
all a man has to do is to take in a neutral
U.S.A. paper or two. I decided to ti’y it,
and sent for the San Jose News. I am
delighted at the way it is putting the plain
facts of the case before the great American
people, and, incidentally, before me. It
explained in a recent issue, with grave de-
tachment, that the uproar was caused by
the Belgians assassinating an Austrian duke
while he was on a visit to Brussels; that
the Montenegrins immediately rushed in to
attack Austria on the flank; that Russia
and France hurried up to assist this feloni-
ous movement and forced Germany to go
to the aged Emperor’s aid. No wonder
T T ncle Sam feels a bit muddle-headed about
this business!

I THINK YOUR REMEDY A EINE ONE
Writes MISS MURIEL STARR.
This Brilliant Actress says she will never again travel
without a bottle of Dr. Sheldon’s New Discovery.
Miss Muriel Starr has had a wonderful
career of star roles in America. Her
“Mary Turner” in “Within the Law” lias
afforded Australians merely an idea of
the work she is capable of doing.
Her appearance in “Bought and Paid
For” at the Criterion, Sydney, is a revel-
ation to her many admirers.
This remarkable actress writes to the
Sheldon Drug Co., Ltd., as follows:
SHELDON DRUG CO., LTD., Sydney.
Dear Sirs, —
I have been using; your Dr. Shel-
don’s New Discovery for the past
week, and although 1 have never
given a testimonial for anything before
in all my life, I feel that it is my duty
now to write and tell you what a splendid
Remedy I think Dr. Sheldon’s New Dis-
covery is.
I had such a nasty little cold, and it
bothered me so much and affected my voice
when speaking. I never was so annoyed before,
and 1 could not seem to get rid of it—some-
times it was a little better and then much
worse. At last I was told to try Dr. Sheldon’s
New Discovery, and I did, and I think it fine.
The very first dose eased my throat and helped
my voice, and now every trace of the cold is
gone. There was no getting better, and
then worse again, with that cold after start-
ing with New Discovery—l simply improved
right along, and I want to tell you that T
think your remedy a fine one, and 1
intend never to travel again without
a bottle in my grip.
Wishing New Discovery every suc-
cess,
I am, sincerely yours,
(Sgd.) MURIEL STARR.

The Horseman.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
W HO rides in haste on yonder road
With sable plume and hair?
Gome, comrade, know you yonder
shape
That rides in silence there?
His horse is black, his cloak is black,
His eyes as black as night:
See, comrade, where his shadow falls
There comes a bitter blight.
The green leaves twist and turn and fade,
The flower-folk droop and die ;
Who has not met him surely will
Ere Youth and Age go by.
I saw a huntsman clad in green
Ride singing through the morn ;
He met yon Horseman on a hill
And now he rides forlorn.
1 saw two lovers hand in hand
That danced, and skipped, and ran —
A pretty twain, a merry twain,
A laughing maid and man.
But now, where Love, heart-housed, abode,
Bide pain and bitter wrath ;
The happy twain are one and one —
The Horseman crossed their path.
’Tis he, ’tis said, who poisons peace,
And turns the kind milk sour;
Set him aloof, gibe, mock at him,
He, scowling, waits his hour.
Then —then, perchance, when most you smile,
Most give yourself to mirth—
He trips you up (the wrestler’s trick)
And tumbles you to earth.
I tell you, comrade, he’s a king
AVho lords it over all;
lie’s guest, though he be barred and banned.
At feast and festival.
Rich meats, rich-tasting meats and wines 1
May make the moment fair,
But look! Behind the palms, the flowers,
He scowls in silence there.
Hide, ride or run, or what you will—
Up arms and thrust him back —
’Tis useless ; in the end lie comes
A blight upon your track.
You drink: “Here, fellows, rouse the night
And let the loud song rise.”
A touch....you turn....the red wine
spills....
His eyes are on your eyes.
There is but one sleep where he comes
To spoil your dreams no more;
There is but one door of escape.
It is no tavern door.
Through that door you shall pass in time
When life has spent its sands;
And, free at last, shall laugh to see
His fruitless stretch of hands.
He ploughs his furrow on your brow,
His breath makes white your hair.
Hide, comrade, hide ! Yet hide in vain !
Yon Horseman is Black Care.
N.S.W.
RODERIC QUINN.
How We Found Fleming.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
HERB’S a gully in the bush ’way back
of Waima Settlement that the Maoris
won’t go within coo-ee of. Incidentally
there’s a grave in it. Old Puketawa is still to
the fore, and, if you ask him, will be glad to
explain it in his own, way. Whether you
get the hang of it afterwards is your own
affair. I never did. Anyhow, the thing
happened. It’s a queer place, the heart of a
North Auckland bush, and there’s some queer
things that happen in it. The Maoris are
mighty queer people to live among, too.
You get to grow like ’em, if you stay there
too long and—oh ! what’s the use of trying
to explain?
Mind you, it’s my opinion Fleming was
always a bit mad and more than two parts
a damn fool. But that’s no reason the poor
devil should get snuffed out the way he did.
The trouble was he was a new-chum, with
all the corners sticking out on him, and so
darned cocksure there was no telling him.
He was out to collect assorted bugs and
other creeping things for one of those queer
London houses that trade in such critters.
A Sydney schooner put him ashore, four
miles down coast, with a tin case ou his
back; and when he’d tramped it round to
tile kaianga he started in, first jump, to
make himself a holy nuisance.
„ Of course the folk were glad to see him.
You know the old-style Maori way? Ilail
fellow well met to everyone. They built
him a new nikau whare, fit and clean enough
for a duke. But when they were for chuck-
ing in a strapping young kotiro (girl) to
keep his house warm for him and cook his
grub, he went off pop like a wowser. lie
gassed about loose living and started in to
lecture on the higher morality. My soul!
The cheek of it! Him, from the Bethel in
Beckham Rye, to come the Holy Joe over
Apa ram a Teteven and his crowd and show
cm how to entertain the stranger within
the gates!
That took ’em below the belt, as you may
say. It wounded ’em in their tenderest feel-
ings. For a minute things looked as if
they might ha’ got lively, but I did my
best to soften ’em down. I told ’em, iii
Maori, that it wasn’t Fleming’s fault. I
said that he belonged to a different tribe o’
pakehas a tribe that were all born mad
and hated good liquor and pretty women like
poison. Of course Fleming didn’t under-
stand but when I’d got the other beggars
laughing it was right-o. They even began
to: pity him. ’specially the girls, who, to
make up, started in to make things extra-
comfortable.
Him and me didn’t hit it off too well.
Hed come once a week to the store to buy
prog ; but he was a morose sort of devil, and
I dropped talking to him. But the worst
was his rowing with old Teteven, which,
being the only other white man, made it a
bit uncomfortable for me. It was like this,
the old chief had got it into his head that
Jt was Ins place to look after Fleming. So,
;'ben Fleming took to wandering around
muse o nights, after his bush-beetles, the
old chief warned him about the tree-devils,
told him the danger of getting lost, and
advised him to take a guide. The silly ass
took it bad. He as good as called the old
chap a damned fool and told him to mind
his own dried shark. That put old Teteven
on his ear. He shifted Fleming’s whare
outside the kaianga, gave him a good dress-
ing-down in Maori and pidgin-English, and
wound up by telling him to go to the devil
and get lost his own way. All the same,
when word came that Fleming really had
got lost and hadn’t been seen for three days,
I got together a mob of Maoris and started
in to hunt him up.
We scoured that bush iike ferrets in a
rabbit-warren. Fleming’s specimen case,
chucked aside in the first panic of the lost,
was found on the second day. Later, we
gathered little flags of clothing stuck on the
thorns of the underscrub; but of the man
himself never a trace. A shout went up on
the left of the line of beaters. Tiaka had
come across a torn singlet, boots and a pair
of trousers, neatly piled, boots on top, in a
thicket of supple-jacks. The poor chap had
gone dotty and stripped to the buff.
They all do it. It’s part of the beastly
process. I’ve assisted at more than one of
these lost-man hunts in my time, and it’s
always the same. There’s some sort of
ghoulish formula about the whole business.
Man or woman, .dead or mad, they’re all
mother-naked when you find ’em.
The crowd were for giving up the search.
“What use?” they said. “He’s mad and
the taipos have got him. We’ve searched
everywhere but the Valley of Ghosts, where
no man goes. It is enough.” You couldn’t
blame the beggars, from their point of view,
but I wasn’t going to give in. Fleming and
I were the only white men within a hundred
miles. I didn’t propose to leave his bones
lying around loose, and, mad or not mad,
there was just a chance of getting him before
the end. So I stuck to it and Puketawa
stuck too.
They’d turned out Puketawa a first-chop
Christian from the mission school, but when
I got to know him he’d had a relapse and
backslid into tohunga (priest) to the tribe
and general medicine-man. We had fixed
up a sort of business partnership. He
canvassed around among the natives for
trade to the store and took his commissions
in lots of gin, which I served out to him.
Whether it was natural affection or fear of
a possible cutting off of the square-face if I
got lost myself, I don’t know. Maybe a bit
of both. Anyhow, he said he had a powerful
karakia (spell) tliat’d scare the bush-devils
into fits, and came along too.
The third night found us camped at the
head of the Valley of Ghosts. It was a
weird place. Giant tree-boles played hide
and seek in the light of the camp-fire. They
played bo-peep to the fire-flicker and stepped
in and out of the shadow like ghosts. The
dark was full of minor night-noises; a
scurry of unseen feet rustling through the
undergrowth and sounds of soft laughter in
the long-drawn hush-h-h of the trees. The
dew fell on us from the leaves in cold drib-
lets. Great owls winged silently into the
circle of light, stared at us, and vanished
again as silently. Down the ravine sounded,
far off, a tap-tapping of ghostly axes falling
upon wood. A huge tree swooped through
the night and fell, crashing among the under-
scrub. And again came that cachinnation of
elfin laughter.
Puketawa piled dry wood on the fire.
“No good te dark.” he _ said. “T’is place
fulla taipos (devils).”
“Bosh,” I answered, just to keep my end
up, though I wasn’t feeling too good myself.
“Ah,” he said, “pakeha he werry crever,
but he not know ewerryt’ing. At t’e mission
school te’ missionary teach me many t’ings,
some good, some bad. But he no teach me
about t’e taipo. I learn him after from t’e
tohunga.”
After supper of roast pigeon, Puketawa
started to liven up the general ghastliness
of the place with his views on psychology
and taipos generally. I tried to siioo him
on to a new track, but it was no good.
He’d got some useful information to impart
and was bound to get it off his chest, or die.
Short of downing him and sitting on liis
head there was no stopping him.
“Oh yeh,” he concluded. “Ewerrypody got
t’e taipo on te inside. When he die t’e
taipo come out of he’s mout’ and go to
ewerrypody he like best. When I die my
taipo go to my prudder at Kaikohe and to
you.”
I told him not to trouble and advised him
to keep his ghost at home.
“No trouble.” he said. “Now, after orr
t’at talk. I tink I have another trink and
ko to sreep.”
He sucked my flask about dry. drew his
blanket over his head and lay back among
the fern. I couldn’t sleep. I lay and lis-
tened to Puketawa’s muffled snores and the
drip of the dew. A mopoke hooted out of
the shadows, and the dark stirred with mul-
titudinous rustlings. Great green lizards,
red-eyed, blinked at me from the fern
tangle. A foot-long centipede crawled from
a rotten log, sat up on its tail and sunned
itself in the firelight, swaying its body in a
sort of fantastic dance.
By and bye he and the lizards went away
to roost and the heavy silence shut down
like a cloak. It must have been after mid-
night when I was startled by a distant
shout. It was a human cry and it brought
me up with a jump.
No. nothing! Only the drip of moisture
and the drone of Puketawa’s snoring.
The fire had burned to red embers. My
soul! How those trees did seem to crowd in
upon me in the dark and the weight of the
forest press unon my senses ! I threw dry
wood on the fire and stirred it to a blaze,
and the cry was repeated. Nearer this time.
A long-drawn coo-ee-e, shrill with a note of
despair. It scared Puketawa awake and he
sat up shivering.
“Fleming, by gad !” I cried.
“Not. Hemini,” said Puketawa. “T’at t’e
taipo.”
Whoever or whatever it was. it was
coming on steadily. We could catch
glimpses of a moving body between the trees.
Suddenly it broke into the circle of light
and stood, mouthing aud gibbering. What
made the thing so peculiarly ghastly was
its utter souudlessness. There had been no
slither of loose stones, as it mounted the
dry watercourse, no snapping of twigs as
it broke the undergrowth. Now

Heeds Zamßuk
THE EVER-READY HEALER.
Every mother realises to-day that a handy pot of Zam-Buk is a
priceless boon. Zam-Buk is not only world-famous for its heal
ing, soothing and germ-destroying qualities,, but gives us for the
first time an ever-ready “first-aid,” uniting simplicity, effective-
ness and safety.
Simplicity.
Because i t requires no previous
needs simply to be taken- out
preparation,
of the pot
with the clean finger-end and rubbed gently over the cut or sore,
when the fine juices sink into the tins' pores in the skin and “get
at” the harmful germs that are lodging in the under-tissues.
Effedive
Because Zain-Buk is prepared by methods en-
tirely different and ahead
of mere ointments and cheap salves or
“creams.” Because it is composed of pure
juices and oils, scientifically refined and skil-
fully combined. The uniform success of
Zam-Buk shows that the ideally effective
balm has been discovered at last.
Safe
Because Zam-Buk’e active constitu-
ents contain no trace of rancid animal
Because
fat, mineral irritant or poisonous acid.
Zarn-Buk achieves its exceptional results
by methods quite different from fatty
ointments and cheap salves. Zam-Buk is
so pure that it suits the frailest invalid
and the youngest babe. It is the one and
only Zam-Buk.
Daily mishaps make Zam-Buk
a daily need ; and its instant ap-
plication on cut, sprain or sore
is a sure safeguard against blood-
poisoning germ diseases and all
the common complications of ac-
cidents and skin diseases.
A MOTHER PRAISES ZAM-BUK.
Mrs. 8. M. Burgess, of 34Cambridge
Street, Rozelle, Sydney, says: “ For
such Injuries as outs, abrasions and
festered sores, and for children who are
always falling and hurting themselves,
Zam-Buk should be kept on a handy shelf
in every home. For chapped hands and
cracked lips caused by the bitter, winter
winds, Zam-Buk Is a splendid remedy.”
Zam-Buk is invaluable

A FEW HOMELY
. . HINTS ON . .
BEAUTY.
By RITA MOYA.
Every woman should take pride in lier personal appearance. If it is not P® B * l * l ®, 1
be beautiful in the fullest sense of the word, at least you « have he
pleasant expression, glossy, well-kept hair, eyes shaded by o g » - manufactured
brows and. a clear, natural complexion. My first advice is .to larly" and do
“beauty preparations.” Use simple, pure, natural ingredien s. advise can be
not.make constant changes and experiments The various things I use and ajvrse
bought in original packages from any reliable chemist. If they
once procure them from his wholesaler if you insist.
How I Discarded an Unsightly Complexion.
—How many women exclaim as they behold
their ugly complexions in the mirror: it i
could only tear off this old skin!’ and. do you
know, it is now possible to do that very thing •
Not to actually remove the entire skin all or a
sudden; that would be too heroic a method
and painful, too, I imagine. The worn-out
cuticle comes off in such tiny particles, and
so gradually—requiring about 10 days to com-
plete the transformation —it doesn t hurt a bit,
Day by day the beautiful complexion under-
neath comes forth. Marvellous! No matter
how muddy, rough, blotchy or aged your com-
plexion, you can surely discard it by this
simple process. Just get some ordinary mer-
colised wax at your chemist’s, apply nightly
like cold cream, washing it off in the morn-
ings.
New Painless Way to Remove Hairy
Growths.— lt now transpires that the mys-
terious white paste used so successfully by
many beauty specialists for ridding the skin
of objectionable hairy growths is nothing
more than powdered pheminol, which can be
found in any chemist’s shop. With pheminol
and water make enough paste to cover hairy
surface; apply, and in two or three minutes
rub off, wash the skin, and it will be free
from hair or blemish.
Shampoo and Hair Beautifler.— You complain
of brittle, faded hair. You will find that keep-
ing the scalp clean and healthy is the most
effective way to restore the natural beauty
and softness, but-in selecting your shampoo
avoid soaps or mixtures containing “free
alkali. By dissolving a teaspoonful of stallax
iii a cup of hot water you will l>ave a mild,
soothing-, cleansing mixture that mahes tne
head feel fine and removes all dust, danurun
and excess of oil, leaving the scalp Mean and
pliant, and assuring a beautiful growth oi
long, lustrous, fluffy hair.
No Powder Necessary.— Yes, powder has
ruined more complexions that it has an lea.
and while you use it you can hope for notning
better than an imitation of a real complexion.
Take my advice: Get from your chemist some
ordinary eleminite and dissolve m a little
water, then you will have an ideal yet inex-
pensive lotion, which seems a part of the sKin,
The result lasts all day long even under the
most trying conditions. To prepare the face
and neck for an evening in a hot ballroom
there is nothing to equal this simple and harm-
less lotion.
If Eyelashes are Short.— Eyelashes will be
greatly beautified if mennaline be applied at
lasli-r’oots with thumb and forefinger. A
few such treatments make them grow long,
silkv and curly. Thin, straggly eyebrows will
grow thick and lustrous by merely rubbing
mennaline on, but be careful and don t get
any where no hair is wanted.
Wonderful Growth of Hair. —Long ago 1
made a resolution to try and concoct a real
hair grower. My own formula, now perfected
after tedious experimenting, has had the effect
of giving me a wealth of hair that issurpris-
ing. Obtain from your chemist an original
package of boranium and mix with this !-pmt
of bav rum. ftub this into the scalp night
and morning with the finger tips. It sets the
hair roots tingling with new life. I”

it stood before us and grinned—speech-
I’d seen some fairly ugly things in my
time, but nothing to equal that. The figure
was what had once been a white man. It
looked like Fleming and it didn’t. It was
mother-naked, scratched and torn, foul with
blood and mire. The skin was livid-yellow
and the hones showed through it, like knobs,
in the light of the fire. It looked like a
week-old corpse. Only the eyes were alive
and they held the terror of things unspeak-
able. Puketawa started his karakia, but
the old idiot had forgotten the words in Ins
funk, and could only whine.
Before I could speak, the thing came for
me, on the run, bony arms outstretched and
clutching skeleton hands. I was a strong
man then, but that scared me. I lifted the
gun and fired over its head. The thing
threw up its arms and vanished into the
night.
Did I 'really--hear the sound of its break-
ing through the thicket-tangle? Or was it
fancy?
“God!” I muttered. “I can’t have hit the
poor devil. I fired over his head.”
Puketawa heard me.
“No,” he said. “You no hit Hemini. T’at
t'o taipo. We find t’e corp in t’e morning.”
“Curse your nonsense,” I yelled, and
kicked him out of his blanket. “It’s Fleming,
right enough. Dotty as Nebuchadnezzar.
Get up and hunt.”
I’uketawa picked up his blanket. “Taihoa,”
lm said. “We hunt in t’e morning,” and sat
down, doggedly.
He was right. Beyond the circle of fire-
light the night stood like a black wall,
heavy, impenetrable. I jibbed at hunting a
raving lunatic through the dark of that
horrible place.
In the morning Puketawa led the way
into the ravine of the Valley of Ghosts.
There was no track, no spoor of any sort.
Was it instinct; intuition? Had the beggar
known all along? Anyhow, he followed a
straight trail, through the scrub thicket,
like a dog on a scent. Where the ravine
narrowed to a rock-cleft he gripped my arm
and pointed. Something lay across a jutting
rock-spur. A white wisp against the black-
ness of the stone. It was Fleming or what
was left of him. The ants had been at work
and the shrivelled skin hung loose on the
bones that were sticking through it.
“T’ou seest?” said Puketawa.
D. W. FAGAN.
Cranky.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
IT was the night of the husking party
in Muddle’s barn. A lantern and a
couple of slush-lamps threw a glare
on a row of figures seated on pine blocks
before a huge pile of unhusked corn, with a
straddle of yellow cobs on either side, and a
growing heap of white husks behind them.
The central figure of the party was Tom
Muddle. Beside him sat Murty Brown;
and distributed among the Scullys and the
Garrys were his son and daughter, Octavius
and Sarah Muddle.
The men yarned, and smoked and worked;
the women gossiped and worked; the
stripped cobs rained into the straddles. Now
and again a cob would slip from someone’s
hand and hit someone else’s head, which
had the effect of invigorating, tlie whole
party; and sometimes they had a race, a
hundred or a thousand up, for the
championship of Big Bend, which was good
business at least for Tom Muddle.
When the buskers had got well settled
down to work and reminiscences the dogs
on a sudden sprang out of their warm beds
iu the husks and barked with enthusiasm,
whilst someone approaching from the
darkness growled back at them to “lay
down.”
Tom Muddle waded out through the husks
to investigate, and Murty, not being used to
husking, followed to stretch his’legs.
Ai: the corner of the barn they found a
tired-looking parson approaching sideways,
with his eyes on the dogs. His horse had
knocked up, and he had left it at the
si ipr ails .down the flat. He wished to get to
Barmen's that night—if Mr. Muddle would
oblige him with the loan of a horse till
to-morrow. ,
“Certainly, certainly,” said. Muddle.
“Lend’s a hand to ketch old Captain, Murty.
As luck has it, I’ve got him in the little
paddock ’ere, but he’s a blamed old rogue to
ketch.”
When the rogue had been caught and
mounted, the parson said: “If this young
man will come with me to the bottom slip-
rails lie can fetch your saddle back on my
horse. He’ll lead up without trouble after
his rest.”
Murty said “Riglit-o!” and started off
down the track before Muddle could offer
any objections. Murty didn’t like husking
corn, and it was a pastime he too frequently
walked into when he visited the farm.
That was the last they saw of Murty that
night.
The sliprails were a mile from the house.
Arrived there, the parson dismounted,' and
producing a long-barrelled pistol from his
pocket, levelled it at the head of liis
astonished attendant.
“Hands up !”
Murty’s hands shot up smartly, and his
hair, by the feel of his scalp, seemed to be
following suit.
“Have vou any weapons?”
“No.”
“Have you any cord to tie yourself up
with?” i
“No!” . ..
“Hands down.”
Murty dropped them with pleasure.
“What’s your name?” ■ ;
“Murty Brown.” , j
“How old are you?”
“Forty-six.”
“Hands up !’•’
Murty raised them again rebelliously.
“Can vou ride?”
“Yes;” -
“Mount that horse.”
Murty noticed that the weapon pointed at
him was old ,and rusty, and the stock
appeared damaged ; but he. never doubted
that it was capable of doing him violent
injury, and lost no.time in getting into the
saddle. Then the parson bound bis hands
behind him with a strap, and taking the
reins off, tied his feet to the stirrups with
them. Next, standing on a stump, he
gagged him tightly with two folded
handkerchiefs, and finally, giving Captain a
whack with his hat, sent him oft with a
jump that nearly dislocated Murty’s neck.
Then he mounted the knocked-up horse and
galloped furiously away into the bush.
“By eripes, this is a queer go if you like!”
muttered Murty, kicking at Captain’s sides
in the hope of working him round to the
house. But Captain steered for a big swamp
in the middle of the paddock, stopping at
intervals to take in grass. “What did he
do it for?” he kept asking himself, without
deriving any satisfaction from the query.
“Where’s there any common sense or reason
in a caper like this? Lord love a duck, what
did I ever do to him that he should make it
his special business to come ’ere an’ tie me
to. this animal? Nothing!” with emphasis.
“Never saw the lunatic in my life before.”
It was the greatest conundrum Murty
had ever encountered in his wandering
career. There was no motive, no apparent
object; the thing was inexplicable.
“I’ve had to do with some cranky pranks
in my time,” he mumbled, “but this one’s
away top of the whole bunch.”
He tried some more contortions on
Captain with the object of changing his
course. Captain treated them all with
indifference.
“If I owned such a cow of a horse as this,”
'Murty dreamed vengefully, “I’d buy a pig
an’ feed it with the beast. He’s a pearl!”
Getting wild, he kicked him into a jog.
Then Murty bumped up and down till his
teeth rattled, without getting any nearer
home. Fortunately Captain was a quiet
horse, lie didn’t seem to mind being sat
on continuously, providing be was let graze
about. He grazed about for hours, while
Murty watched the ’possums and squirrels,
listened to the mopokes and curlews, and
studied astronomy.
At intervals he sat up and mumbled the
following remarks to the shadows: —
“Hands up!”
“What’s your name, you cow?”
“Hands down.”
“How old are you, darn you?”
“Hands up!”
He saw the fire blaze up at the barn, and
knew they were burning the husks; then
he saw lights at the house, and knew they
were having coffee and doughnuts; and
later he heard the visitors talking and
laughing as they made their way home
across the flat. He kicked Captain again
on the off-chance of intercepting somebody.
Captain walked into the swamp, and the
more Murty tried to kick him out of it the
deeper he went into it. till. Murty’s feet
were under water and his toes were
partially frozen. He cursed him inwardly
for a stubborn beast, while Captain fed
greedily on water-grass and rushes. He
bit desperately at the gag, worked his jaws
and twisted his face into all manner of
contortions. If he could get his mouth free
he would soon let them know where he was
and what was keeping him. But free he
could not get it.
“It’s no use,” he concluded. “I’m part
an’ parcel of this gormandisin’ quadruped,
an’ jes’ got to graze about till mornin’.”
By-and-bye Captain got tired of. the
swamp, and going out on to a rise, picked
up several mates. They trotted round him
and snorted, and one came up and smelt
him. Captain wheeled round and lashed out
so Suddenly that Murty very nearly toppled
over. He was a fair horseman, but he
wasn’t used to riding in that fashion, and
when the mob galloped away, and Captain
kicked up his heels and galloped after them,
it tried him to the utmost to maintain his
equilibrium. They went round the swamn
twice before Captain pulled up; and when
he turned into a clump of trees and showed
a disposition to camp, Murty encouraged
him to do so. He was very tired and stiff,
and after trying an hour to keep his eyes
open, be fell asleep.
When he woke, the sun was up.. Looking
towards the house, he saw Octavius and a
stranger riding away. lie was still in the
clump of trees. Leaning towards a friendly
limb, be succeeded in forcing the gag from
bis mouth. Then he kicked Captain into the
open and coo-eed lustily. Sarah and her
father had been standing on the verandah
watching along the track and wondering
what had become of Brown.
A few minutes later they were down the
paddock, making frantic efforts to catch
Captain, Tom Muddle holding out his hat
with a few clods in it, and saying. “Kerp,
kerp, kerp!” while Murty sat back and said.
“Whey-e-e-yah!” with great emphasis. But
Captain had seen the hat-trick before, and
dodged away. Sarah, being more nimble-
footed than her father, ran after him, flying
to right and left, till she had him going
towards the yard.
“Who tied you up, Murty?” she yelled
after him.
Murty, between jerks, related the circum-
stances in as few words as the English lan-
guage would permit.
“That was poor old Brushook from down
the river,” she shouted.
“Who-o?”
“Samyel Brushook,” Sarah repeated. “He's
broke out again.”
“It’s a pity he didn't break his blamed
neck!” snapped Murty.
“He gets queer fits at times, an’ plays
high jinks. One time he imagines he’s a
bushranger, an’ then he thinks lie’s a parson
-—an’ other things. He was a squatter one
time, owned a station somewhere: on Cooyar
Creek, but lost it all. He’s always been a
bit weak like since, but there’s no harm in
him.”
.Murty grinned at the irony of it. He
found himself wondering, as she dodged him
into the yard, what might have happened to
him if there had been harm in Brushook.
“His uncle w T as here this morning.” Sarah
rattled on as she unbound him. “He’s been
all night chasin’ around. Seems Mr. Brushook
went off yesterday with an old pistol he’d
found. ’Twasn’t loaded”—■—
“ ’Twarn’t loaded !” Murty exclaimed with
disgust and mortification in his voice.
“No,” Sarah answered. “It has no
hammer or trigger; but he stuck up a parson
with it on the road. Took his horse and
made him change clothes. Lucky, uncle
found tli’ parson, or there might ’ave been
trouble.”

The
Importance
of
Efficient
Insulation I
The. importance of efficient insulation, in many cases, is not realised. Great
care is shown in the selection of a steam plant to ensure the greatest economy,
vet the insulation which is of equal importance is in many cases partly neg-
lected. If you strive to make a saving in the steam consumption of your
engine, wh'v not make certain that it is not wasted again through faulty in-
sulation? The claims we make as to the exceptional efficiency of Newall’s
Coverings are fully borne out by a'ctual test. and. further, by the enormous
sales, including repeat orders, and we do not know of a single instance where
any other covering has been used once Newall’s have been tried.
The Ultimo and White Bay Power Houses are insulated throughout with
Newall’s Coverings, and this material has also been adopted exclusively by the
N.S.W. and Victorian Governments. ’These are facts which will tend to fur-
ther prove our claims. The innumerable advantages of this material over all
other forms of lagging are described in interesting booklet, which we will be
pleased to mail you along with samples.
