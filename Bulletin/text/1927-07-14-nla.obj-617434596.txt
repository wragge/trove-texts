THE MOUTH THE GATEWAY for DISEASE.
Scientists have proved conclusively that no fewer
than 38 different infections inay he traced to the
human mouth as a starting point. The mouth thus
being the gateway for the entrance of disease, it
is here that precautions are most necessary.
Hudson’s Eumenfhol
Jujubes
Are the most powerful, safe and pleasant Germi-
cide and Antiseptic known. Being- destructive to
all organisms which give rise to infectious diseases,
they keep the mouth in a sweet, healthy condition.
The Lancet (London) states: —“Their purpose is to
act as a bactericide in the mouth. This result is
likely to be gained, for in the experiments tried
fiumenthol Jujubes proved to be as effective bao-
tericidally as is creosote.”

Lions on Two Legs
Even the humblest of the earth may,
under certain circumstances, see, meet and
even converse with the great ones whose
names are inscribed indelibly upon the
records of a nation. Humble indeed was
I, and youthful withal, a mere small item
in the editorial department of a big London
publishing house, long ago in those noble
days of the ’eighties when lions walked
the earth. And let me hasten to say that
only one of those I knew ever roared, and
his roar of anger or disdain held laughter
in it and often ended in a guffaw, for his
roaring was rather the outpouring of a
big nature, the torrent overflow of a heart
filled to the full with enthusiasm. It was
fitting that William Ernest Henley, the
roaring lion, should be the central figure of
my particular menagerie, for he was the
magnet drawing all the others unto him;
and as it was my privilege to act as a
sort, of “fag” for him when he was editor
of the Magazine of Art at Cassell’s, it
was my privilege to be in a position where
I could observe these lions unsuspected of
watchfulness; so I saw the Stevensons (Bob
and Louis), Colvin, Dobson, Gosse, Forbes
Robertson (senior), Monkhouse, Hannay,
Wibley and others when they were beasts
on show.
Sidney Colvin was a big, handsome, mili-
tary-looking man with short, fair beard and
waxed moustache, a man of no special per-
sonality; Austin was short and fat,
as gentle as his ’ Dresden-china poetry and
prose; Edmund Gosse was a quiet, spec-
tacled savant, who took life seriously but
was modest enough, in demeanor; John
Forces Robertson, the father of Johnston
and Norman, the actors, and Frances, the
writer, was a fine, big man with short, black
beard, wearing a soft, -felt, hat and flowing
cape, a man of good artistic knowledge but
no great producer; R. A. M. (“Bob”)
Stevenson, cousin of R.L.S., was short and
thick-set-, a very lively person, with short,
dark moustache and curly hair, round,
plump face, somewhat commonplace in
appearance, sure of himself in his deep
knowledge of those art subjects (such as
Velasquez) which he had made his own,
but with a somewhat small range; Robert
Louis Stevenson, a strange creature but
quite sane, feeble of frame but fxdl-blooded
and by no means anaemic, a sort of impish
buccaneer or imitation pirate, full of vim
and humor, eccentrically dressed in drab,
loose garments in which a flannel shirt and
collar, bunched tie, velveteen coat and
patterned waistcoat were the conspicuous
items, rather florid than pale but hard of
complexion, his brown eyes very bright and
eager, his long, brown hair straight and
dull-looking, parted in the middle and flap-
ping over the ears; no great talker and
at that time by no means sure of himself
but very eager. His Child Verses were first,
published at this time in the Magazine of
Art —a mistake I always thought, but he
was hard up; otherwise he had little to do
with the magazine. Cosmo Monkhouse was
short and fat, with close beard going grey
but reddish; he was somewhat ponderous in
manner, not of great worth as a writer, but
a sound art critic. David Hannay was a big,
strong, dark man who looked Spanish and
carried with him the breezy atmosphere of
the open ocean, giving one the impression
that he had just arrived from Spain or
Mexico and knew a great deal about brig-
ands; he was rather a sound journalist than
a literary man.
The general impression left by these men
was of a band of good friends who did not
take themselves very seriously, but, were
keenly interested in their work, and all a
cheery, faithful crew, ready at any moment
to tug their forelocks, hitch their breeches,
and cry “Aye, aye, sir,” to the rough com-
mands of their captain, Henley, for whom
they had an unbounded admiration not
altogether tree from amusement at, his idio-
syncrasies. He was a big, pale-faced
physically strong man, with heavy features,
broad nose and thick lips, a short-cropped
ginger beard and thick hair of the same
hue rising aggressively on his square
cranium, big hands with stubby, broad-
tipped fingers, square shoulders made
squarer by his crutches, ungainly, wooden-
looking feet that never fairly trod the
floor, his pale eyes full of fight rather than
fire, yet capable of abundant rough humor
and even sentiment.
A little reminiscence about Henley and
Dobson, which probably no one but myself
knows, for it concerned just us only. Hen-
ley had one objectionable habit as an
editor-—he would revise other men’s work
and on one occasion scored one of Austin
Dobson’s articles on art-china-very heavily.
Dobson returned the proof to me one day
with the smiling remark that he supposed
it was his article but he scarcely recognised
it- I said, “Yes, I thought he might have
left, it alone,” and Dobson said quizzically,
“It’s like a bull in a china shop,” and went
out as we both laughed. I repeated the
phrase to Henley when I next saw him (he
was not, a very constant attendant at the
office) and he gave one of his big laughs
and told me to have the article reset, as
originally rewritten. That was like Henley.
EDWARD A. VIDLER.
Fascism
, ls °. ne °f the characteristics of Fascism
t lat, while it has busied itself and its mem-
bers with the reconstitution of post-war
Italy, it has, as yet, bequeathed little to
the world of literature. For this reason
the enquiring political student finds few
books which deal authoritatively with the
subject. It is with pleasure, therefore, that
one reads Fascism, by Giuseppe Prezzolini,
translated to the English by Kathleen Mac-
Millan.
{i publishers claim that Prezzolini
gives an unbiassed history, the first of
its kind in this country, of this new and
powerful political movement.’’ That the move-
ment is new is open to doubt, In 1922 Ettore
Ciccotti showed that it is really part
and parcel oi the development of nations.
In its infancy it may be compared with
the krypteia of Sparta or the eteric. of
Athens, and other similar phenomena, which
are repeated as a manifestation of self-
del ence by strong and active groujis or
classes, uniting and forming centres of re-
sistance : exercising thus, by their extended
action, general functions of State in a period
in which its protection is weak or ineffi-
cient, In Italy itself there was a move-
ment which bore the name of “Fasci” anil
was led by the Socialists in 1893; but it
was confined to a small area, and its exist-
ence was short,
The birth of the present movement may
be traced to the “Fasci de combattimento,”
groups of armed men which flourished from
October, 1914, till May, 1915. Their ranks
were largely recruited from the Socialists
and Republicans who were in favor of Italy’s
intervention in the Great War. During
the actual war period, having achieved its
object, the movement remained dormant,
many of its leaders, including Mussolini,
being at that time in the trenches. At
the close of hostilities, with the general
demobilisation of its army, Italy found
itself confronted with the serious prob-
lem of unemployment, caused by the num-
ber of ex-soldiers thrown on the labor
market and the cessation of the war-time
activity in the manufacture of munitions
and army equipment. Instead of the Gov-
ernment taking steps to right the evil, and
incidentally honoring its promise given to
the soldiers on enlistment, that they should,
in the future, be the leaders of their coun-
try, taking the places of those who stayed
at home, the men found an impotent Gov-
ernment, devoting its time to foreign affairs,
and neglecting urgent problems at home.
The result was industrial upheaval. Strikes,
fostered by Bolsheviks, broke out through-
out the country, paralysing industry, de-
grading the country’s foreign credit, and
reducing the State to a condition of internal
revolt. From the four corners of the nation
ex-service men demanded a fulfilment of
the Government’s promises and their rein-
statement to, at the least, their former posi-
tions. Still the Government remained in-
active, and Italy started on its downward
slide to revolution. These men, war-
wearied and disillusioned, sought some
movement which would give them justice.
At this critical period there arose Mus-
solini, who had fought at their side in the
trenches, and who had been tirelessly ad-
vancing their claims since the Armistice.
Upon his initiative a meeting at Milan was
convened on March 23, 1919, and the Fascist
party drew up its programme. Some of
its articles were drastic; for example, it
demanded a super-tax on capital and an
appropriation of 85 per cent, of war profifs
on army contracts. But it at least gave
to its exasperated countrymen the promise
of a change in the old order of government,
and a more equitable system of representa-
tion and division of profits. From the date
of this convention to the date of the “march
on Rome,” the culmination of its work of
establishment, by mighty schemes of pro-
paganda, public speeches, and enrolment of
members the Fascist party grew. It gradu-
ally,' by its arguments, exhausted the
strength of its strongest rival, Socialism,
and prepared itself to receive the trust of
government.
The author traces the various activities
of the Government since its inception, at
times warmly approving and at times as
warmly criticising its actions. He .gives
some illuminating information on the for-
mation of foreign Fascist societies; it is
unfortunate that he does not more fully
state his opinions of the future of Fascism.
But he answers the critics who would insist
that Fascism has handed Italy over to a
dictatorship by pointing out that, to pro-
perly understand Italian politics and politi-
cal parties, it should be clearly understood
in what relation a leader stands to his
party
“Italy is a country dependent upon her
own leaders; and although the Socialists and
Popular party sought to do away with them
they could not escape from the Italian law.
which makes the man of first importance!

How England Discovered Russia
Richard Hakluyt’s Principal Navigations,
Voyages, Traffiques and Discoveries of the
English Nation is the bible of our mercan-
tile marine. A new edition in eight volumes
is now being issued by J. M. Dent and
Sons, and with its clear type and many
maps and portraits will attract readers to
whom the author has hitherto been but a
name.
Young Richard, on a visit to his cousin
in the days when Elizabeth was queen,
“found lying open upon his boord certeine
bookes of Cosmographie, with an universal
Mappe.” This first boyish glimpse into
the geography of the then known world
excited in him an interest that colored
his life. At Christ Church, Oxford, he read
all the books of voyages ho could lay hands
on, studied a number of languages, acquired
the arts of map-making and navigation and
in other wavs prepared himself for the work
of his life. ‘ Behind all this application lay
a definite purpose. “I both heard in speech
and read in books,” he remarks in one of
his dedications, “other nations miraculously
extolled for their discoveries and notable
enterprises by sea, but the English of all
others for their sluggish security, and con-
tinuall neglect of the like attempts.” It
was this “continuall neglect” that Richard
Hakluyt set himself to remedy, and in doing
so spared no pains. It was only “after
great charges and infinite cares, many
watchings, toils and travels and wearying
out of his weake body” that he accom-
plished the task of producing his first “three
several volumes.” Among the mass of re-
corded matter he brought together was a
paper which has a special interest at the
present time when the relations between
England and Russia are severely strained.
It describes “howe Moscovie was in our
time discovered by Richard Chanceler in
his toward Cathay, by the direction
and information of M. Sebastian Cabota,
who long before had this secret in his
minde.”
In 1553 the merchants of England were
seriously concerned that their commodities
were “in small request with the countreys
and people about us and neere unto us,”
whereas all foreign merchandises were “in
great accompt and their prises wonderfully
raised.” They resolved upon “a newe and
strange Navigation.” Having consulted with
Cabota it was decided that three ships
should be prepared “for the search and
discoverie of the Northerne part of the
world.” A company was formed and money
collected. Six thousand pounds purchased
the vessels and equipped them. By com-
mon consent Richard Chanceler was chosen
to command the adventure.
Beyond the fact that Captain Chanceler
was troubled about some of the ships’ vic-
tuals having putrified, and, still more im-
portant, that “the hoggesheads of wine
leaked,” all went well for the first part of
this voyage to the unknown north. Then
the little fleet struck trouble. In a tempest
the ships were parted and only Chanceler’s
vessel, the Bonaventure, survived. After
putting in for Wardhouse in Norway in
the hope that he might be rejoined by
some escapee from shipwreck, he determined
to proceed alone, and “sailed so farre that
he came at last to the place where he found
no night at all but a continuall light and
brightness of the Sunne shining clear upon
the huge and mightie Sea.” They reached
a great bay and there cast anchor, “and it
happened that they espied a farre off a
certeine fisher boate.” Chanceler endeav-
ored to communicate with the natives, “but
they, being amazed with the strange great-
nesse of his shippe, began presently to
avoyde and to flee.” The fugitives were,
however, overtaken, and the English cap-
tain treated them so generously that the
strangers were welcomed to the shores of
“Moscovie.” A message was sent to the
Emperor “to certify him of the arrival of
a strange nation, and withall to know his
pleasure concerning them.”
After some delay Master Chanceler and
his party set out on their land journey on
sleds provided by the people, and “came
at. last to Mosco, the chiefe city of the
Kingdome, and the seate of the King.” On
the way thither the adventurers saw many
sights, such as fine forests of fir-trees and
many animals unknown in England. At
“Mosco” they found a city that was “as great
as the Citie of London with the suburbs
thereof; but for beautie and fairness, no-
thing comparable to ours.” The streets
and ways were not as in London paved
with stones; the buildings were of wood
and covered with shingles. The exception
to this rule was “a very faire Castle, strong
and furnished with artillerie,” the walls of
which were of brick.
After some days of sight-seeing they were
summoned to the Emperor’s court:—
“Being entered within the gates, there sate
a very honorable companie of courtiers, all
apparelled in cloth of golde, down to their
ankles; and tlierehence being conducted into
the chamber of presence, our men began to
wonder at the Majestie of the Emperour; his
seate was aloft, in a very royall throne,
having on his head a diademe or crown of
golde, apparelled with a robe all of gold-
smiths’ worke, and on liis hand he held a
scepter garnished and beset with precious
stones.”
Ivan Basilivich, “greate Duke of Moscovie,
and chiefe Emperour of Russia,” invited
the English company to dinner, where they
saw with vast amazement the vessels, gob-
lets and plates of fine gold; ‘‘the ghests
at this function “were all apparelled with
linnen without, and with rich skinnes with-,
in, and so did notably set out this royall
feast.”
Hakluyt gives a long and interesting des-
cription of the country, its religion, laws
and customs, related with the simplicity of
a Columbus discovering a new world,
though it is difficult to realise in these days
how two great civilisations such close neigh-
bors could grow up in the complete ignor-
ance of each other that Hakluyt indicates.
Chanceler having delivered to the
Emperor the letter from Edward VI. with
which he had been furnished, Ivan, before the
Englishman’s departure, placed in his hands
a reply, in which he expressed his desire
to open up trade relations with the English,
“to have their free Marte with all free
liberties through my whole dominions with
all kinde of wares to come and go at their
pleasure without any let, damage or im-
pediment.”

The Billabong School
Arthur H. Adams (R.P. 5./5/’27) has mis-
understood me. / did not say that the
scarcity of local material for the Australian
novel amounts almost to a famine.” Some
disgruntled critic said that in a previous
issue; I endeavored to show that, instead
of a scarcity of local material, we really
have abundance, did folk but know where
to look for it.
Scenery may not have ever made a play
or a novel, but it helps marvellously in
maintaining the reader’s interest in the
plot. Arid, as a rule, the books we prefer
are those that lift us out of everyday life
into the wonderful world of make-believe.
It is for this that the child devours fairy
tales, that the drab little drudge pores over
the doings of dukes and duchesses, that the
city clerk craves for tales of buccaneers and
South Sea sirens.
There may be. as Mr. Adams says, “a
million souls in Sydney alone, any one of
whom may, by the creative ability of the
novelist, be worthy of exploration and ex-
position.” Granted freely; but—l do not
live in Sydney. My home is in the north,
in the land that is still unknown. It is of
that that I must write, not of Martin-place,
nor Surry Hills, nor Collingwood, places
that, now are little more than names to
me.
“Human nature is fundamentally the
same all the world over.” Granted, also.
Arrawingie, with her red ochre and kangaroo
grease, does not differ very much from
Myrtle Annie, with her rouge and lipstick,
and no up-to-date knut can do the Block
with a grander air than is assumed by Yir-
ragarna as he leads his mates in a cor-
roboree some soft evening, when the camp-
fire glints on the shining dusky forms and
a group of young lubras, eyeing the
assembled dancers, clap their hands on their
thighs in time to the chanted music, while
the bidgerydoo throbs out its thrilling notes.
“Let us stick to the job of presenting
the life around us,” says Arthur H. Adams.
I said just that in the article that he com-
plains of. And I also endeavored to show
that, Australia had ample material to satisfy
the most exacting writer, did he know where
to look for it. I merely gave a list of
items of interest in this neglected portion
of the Commonwealth, and did not trench
on such subjects elsewhere; I left them to
the local writers of the other States.
Yet, let me tell Mr. Adams, it will be a
very sorry day for the world when “the
fascination of the Unknown” ceases to
attract us; it was that which beckoned
Columbus and Cook, Scott and Amundsen,
Ross Smith and Edison, Hume and Leich-
hardt, Kennedy and Stuart.
I have striven, as far as in me lies, to
show to others some of the glories of this
neglected, uncared-for portion of our Com-
monwealth. That my pen is but feeble
for the work none knows better than I;
but at least I have written of the land that
I know and love, a land that still holds
for me “the fascination of the unknown,”
and a dream of better days yet to come,
when the poets and the painters and the
writers of to-morrow spread her wonders
before the world.
J. S. LITCHFIELD.
Status for the Author
In England, where a much larger and more
condensed population provides more chances,
a novelist who makes £250 a year by fiction
alone is considered almost a brilliant suc-
cess, so perhaps there are aggrieved authors
besides the Australian one, and it may be
that there are too many scribes on the
market. Still I am willing to help with a
few suggestions:—
All Australian writers should belong to
a union, which w'ould close its books for a
longer or shorter period when there were
signs of a glut.
Members of the union should be paid day-
labor rates, the hateful system of piecework
or payment at the rate of so much for a
book, with a bonus for quality, being totally
abolished.
Books should sell at a flat rate according
to size, and when a book-lover went to buy a
volume he would be supplied with the next
one on the roster —the one subsequent to the
book he purchased last.
In order to create a demand every per-
son wliose name appears on the electoral
roll should be compelled to devote 44 minutes
each day, bar Sundays and holidays, to the
perusal of Australian literature in book form,
and not merely to newspapers. The Aus-
tralian writer’s employer is the Australian
public, and the employer should be made to
sit up.
In addition I would put an ad valorem
duty on imported books, with possibly a sur-
tax of so much per pound, but in the case of
books by outside authors which were re-
printed here, only a moderate excise should
be levied. Everybody should be allowed to
purchase a foreign book while investing in
the Australian work next on the roster.
I think these propositions are in strict
accordance with Trades Hall principles, and
should command approval.
The export book trade is a separate
matter, and it is difficult to draft a definite
scheme; but obviously a board should be
appointed to deal with it.
HENRY HORSECOLLAR.
A Satchel of Books
Royalty and Loyalty, by G. R. S. Reid
(John Andrews). A pamphlet on the value
of the British Monarchy by the minister of
the Presbyterian Church, Roseville, Sydney.
Euripides, the Idealist, by R. B. Apple-
ton (I)ent). The author goes out of the
beaten track. He is not content with con-
fining himself to the superficial view of the
Greek tragedian as a stark realist, but tries
to find in him more than he actually says—-
an underlying idealism. His politics, his
humanity, philosophy and religion are in
turn dissected.
The Panton 'Magazine. A quarterly de-
voted to literature, art, music and the drama.
A prominent article is “The Problem of
Post-impressionism.” On the artistic side
are some reproductions of woodcuts by John
F. Greenwood. The contributions of verse
include “The Passing of Biddy Malone,” by
A. W. Housman:
Gabriel stood at the old half-door
And his voice was tender and low.
“God save ye, Mother Machree,” says he,
“And are ye ready to go?
“Mother,” says he, “ ’tis Christinas Eve,
And fast and far I have flown,
For Himself has said that the Feast must wait
Till I bring him Biddy Malone.”
This Age of Oars, by Alan D. Mickle
(Vidler). Essays by an Australian writer
which, though dealing with a variety of
subjects, from “D. H. Lawrence” to “Bol-
shevism and Christianity,” have a single
thread through them all. They embody a
philosophy that finds in all the varying for-
tunes of the civilised race a distinctly pro-
gressive movement. We are living in a
great age, one of great expression, of
great blossoming, and these essays endeavor
to analyse and interpret “some of those
immediate emotional and intellectual tenden-
cies that underlie external manifestations.”
Some of the essays have already, in skeleton
form, appeared in The Bulletin, but the
major portion of its contents is new. The
volume is a scholarly and very welcome
contribution to Australian letters.
China, the Facts, by Lieut.-Colonel I*.
T. Etherton (Ernest Benn). The British
viewpoint, by an ex-consul-general and
Judge of the Supreme Court in China. A
resume of past events and present passions,
ending on a note of guarded optimism:
“The nations in the days immediately ahead
who prove their friendship and regard for
Chinese freedom and national aspirations
will reap the reward to be found in the
new China that emerges from the present
chaos.”
Livelihood, by J. Alexander Cunn (Mas-
sina ; Robertson and Mullens). These papers
for social-science students constitute part 11
of “Human Society” and with the remaining
parts on breed, government and culture
present the sociological field as covered by
Professor Cunn, of Melbourne University.
The problem of livelihood is one towards
the solution of which an increasing body
of literature is giving attention. The author
does not regard it as merely a wage prob-.
lem or a matter of hours. To him the
working-class psychology is “lt is.”
he says, “a demand for control,” and the
only solution “seems to lie* in the direction
of the evolving of real trust-guilds, repre-
sentative of the suppliers of capital, flu
managerial experts, technicians and the
workers. Not. until such are evolved will
industrial peace be near. Then, and only
then, can democracy pretend to Jiave laid
hands on the industrial problem.” Whilst
primarily intended as a textbook for students
much of the matter contained in it is original
thought, and constitutes a valuable contri-
bution to socio-economic discussion.
Thirty Years of Modern History, by Wil-
liam Kay Wallace (Allen and Unwin; Rob-
ertson and Mullens). The years covered by
his book represent to the author “one of
those dissolving periods in history when one
picture is fading from view and the new
one has not as yet come into focus. The
organisation of ' society and of the State,
which had endured relatively unchallenged
and unchanged since the seventeenth century,
is now undergoing a complete transforma-
tion. Our ideas of justice, of liberty, of
property, our conceptions of the nature and
function of government are being revised.”
He regards the ferment of the age to be the
result of a widening faith in the idea of
world-unity. “The moral and material wel-
fare of humanity at large is the order of
the day.” At the close of the nineteenth
century political liberty and equality had
been accepted as the natural right of man ;
there remained for determination his econo-
mic freedom. “llow is this treedom to be
attained? What new institutions are re-
quired in order that it may be guaranteed,
as political freedom was guaranteed through
constitutional government and the sovereign
State system? This is the key to the history
of the coming epoch.”

The Unfading Flowers
The sacred dittany
Still blooms, as poets tell,
In fields Elysian with
The asphodel;
And who. would pluck those flowers
On visionary feet
pass the charms that here
The senses cheat.
By stealth of soul alone
,'V'c those blooms to be got
Which, as a poet knows,
May wither not —
No common growth, but what
, Tame of a seed divine,
Eaery as those Were plucked
By Proserpine.
And maybe only when
The flowers that we love here
Are gone, and we too go,
Shall they appear
In the Elysian air,
And we as poets then
Thant of the beauty, come
W’itli Heaven again !

Oil.
Sing me a song, and let the song be loud.
Deep-throated Muse, but not of lovelorn
themes—
The fiow'r in spring, the autumn leaf
_ that fades,
Fair trees of orange blossoming in cloud
By bright and Jily-brinked Italian streams
that ripple through tlie old Pan-
haunted glades.
Nay, rather let the song be one of will,
Strong in the heart of man whose veins
are full
Of pulsing passion to beget new’ toil :
Aiio gores deep-rooted rocks with diamond
drill
And savage ardor, like a black-horned bull,
io waveless seas of basalt-prisoned oil;
Who gores the earth and bores the lava crust
mi l life-stream of a planet bursts
Through frothy nostrils from that deep
profound
l'o load the air with a rich liquid dust;
W hile still for more and more the mortal
thirsts,
Sinking beyond the deeps that great
w’hales sound.
a H ,0 mark the one triumphant hour
v\ hen he shall hold within his hollowed
hand
in Tim fated air and self-conceded sea!
that whitely round him his last dream shall
flow’r
With all things subject to his high com-
mand,
Save tameless unordained Infinity !
see how night-long they run, the flaming
cars,
W ith searchlights playing on the solitudes,
, As they roll ever onward to their mark—
itrange chariots with red round eyes like
. Mars,
Low thunder rumbling in thejr sharded
hoods,
Over long leagues of the bedazzled dark.
And in the very sea's once soundless void
Sound wmkes to call of fire to oil applied,
Till, in his green-w’alled new-invaded
home,
Leviathan, the Terror, turns annoyed,
Spouting white wrath on the astonished
tide,
Bursting the calm with his invidious
foam.
Nor shall the sky remain inviolate,
Nor those pavilions still unvisited
Fven by eagles of Andean flight;
For there he has established a new’ State.
Stable, not perilous with dizzy dread.
Thief as he is of all that makes for
might.

DARIUS.
The Wheat Men.
There is no maiden. Our song
Dies for the want of a lover—
Dies like a wind in the wheat
t Dies at our feet.
Nay, there is a lover. Her heart
Pulses our own with its beat;
We of the open spaces,
We of the wheat!
There is no home, for our lips,
Speaking it, raise but a shadow—
Raise but a story of years;
Raise not our tears.
Nay, thex-e is home. Without ending
Incense shall burn at our feet,
Heaven a temple above us;
We of the wheat.
The virgin of slenderest grace
Dances, the wind for her music;
Lo ! liKe a fay at our feet
Dances the wheat!
Mellows the sun, and maturing,
Pours us the offering sweet;
We shall he loved in the evening,
We of the wheat!

THIS CHILD-ENDOWMENT
BUSINESS.
M. J. Connin gtojS'j M.L.C., one of the most
thoughtful Labor representatives in N. S.
tiles, has no use for the Child Endowment
scheme which has been thrust upon his State.
He has said that the tax on industry which
the Government expacts to suffice for the
payments starting from August 1 “will be
mostly required for administration.” Arid
being a man with great practical experience,
gained mostly in industrial courts, of the
working and cost of Labor legislation, his
opinion is not to be lightly dismissed. E.'
C. Magrath, M.L.C., who was president of
the State A.L.P. for a time and has been
secretary to the organised printers for years,
is also without enthusiasm for the schema.
He says it has been so contrived that skilled
workers will get nothing out of it; and this
is true enough. For instance, an unskilled
laborer who draws £4 ss. a week, the new
basic wage, will, it he has five children under
the age oi 14, be entitled to an additional
per week—ss. per child: But a mechanic
at £5 10s. a week, with the same number
of children to support, will remain at £5 10-.
a week. And his £5 10s. won’t purchase
nearly as much under the new dispensation
as it did before.
* * * *
The difference between the pay of skilled
and of unskilled workers is less in the Com-
monwealth than anywhere else in the world.
Largely because of this, Australia has to
import skilled workers, while it goes into
debt to provide Government jobs, many of
them unproductive, for thousands of the
unskilled. A craftsman in the U.S.A. can
command at least twice as much as the chap
who toys with a shovel or pushes a broom
along a gutter, which fact is a powerful in-
centive to U.S. youngsters to become crafts-
men ; but the margin for skill allowed by the
Commonwealth Arbitration Court is 245. a
week. And thanks to “Good Old Piano”
and the politicians, thousands of N.S.W.
craftsmen are going to have the feeling that
even this margin has been taken away from
them. Should they ask for it to be restored
by an increase of wages, they will be
pointedly reminded of the 3 p.c. tax on
the amount of wages and salaries which
the Child Endowment theorists have clapped
on the employer. They will be reminded
also of the statutory reduction of the work-
ing week lrom 48 hours to 44, of the new
burdens imposed by the Workers’ Compen-
sation Act, of the increased charges for
railway services (although the Government
solemnly undertook to lower them), of the
sixpence in the £ added to the tax on
company profits—already much stiffer than
in competing States—and the corresponding
additions to the rates on individual in-
comes. It will likewise be pointed out to
them that those on whom the 3 p.c. tax
will fall will have to pay more for materials
and services—the railways and the steam-
ship companies will certainly put up their
rates again—besides which they will need
to prepare for the contingency referred to
by Connington, and the still more un-
pleasant, possibility of the return of the
Lanc-Wili.is-Badly combination which,
even when Mutch and his “moderates”
were on the premises, secured Caucus appro-
val for a tax of 62 p.c. So the crafts-
man who feels that he has been deprived
of his “margin for skill” will have a poor
chance of getting it back by award of the
Arbitration Court or otherwise. Possibly
he will accept the loss with philosophic resig-
nation, but, human nature being what it is,
he is more likely to resent it in ways un-
helpful to industry and the community.
* * * *
Child endowment is a noble ideal, and
a useful form of it exists in the Common-
wealth Public Service, thanks to the accom-
modating attitude of the single men. There
seems no good reason why the Common-
wealth scheme should not be extended to
the State services without imposing any
additional burden on the taxpayer. In
the domain of private employment, the thing
might be introduced by arrangements be-
tween employers and employees or their
unions. The promise of income-tax con-
cessions to employers making such arrange-
ments would be an obvious help. But for
one State to rush into a general scheme, a
scheme based on a tax on industry and
requiring a new army of civil servants to
administer it, while five other States look
on, prepared to turn the situation to their
own material advantage, is to buy all sorts
of trouble. The tax on industry is as crude
an impost as was ever devised. It will hit
the good employer hard—for the higher the
wages and salaries he pays, the greater
will his tax be—and give the bad employer
an inducement to become worse by re-
ducing wages and salaries whenever he can,
and, where that is impossible, by dismissing
hands and shoving their work on others.
Moreover, wealthy men who employ little
or no labor, and whose services to the com-
munity are not to be compared with those
of manufacturers and the like—bookmakers,
for instance, and property-owners who live
on their rents and investors in loans free
of State income-tax—will escape.
* * * *
There are other questionable features of
this Child Endowment scheme, especially
the doubtfully constitutional business of
adding the payments to Commonwealth-
award wages. But it will be impossible for
the Nationalists to make political capital
out of it, much as they would like to do.
Instead of washing their hands of the
measure, on the ground that a Govern-
ment which had pledged itself to go to
the country in March had no right to be
passing very questionable legislation in that
month, the Nationalists considered its vote-
catching possibilities and said they would
accept, it, with amendments. So they will
have to share the responsibility for the
results.
A BUTTER FACTORY IN A
WILDERNESS.
The old inhabitant who has revisited his
youthful haunts and found “sweet Auburn,
loveliest village of the plain,” gone to the
dogs and the weeds, is interesting at times.
He recently discoursed in the S. M. Herald,
beginning thus:—
“Quite recently I visited my early haunts
on the Upper Macleay River. Twenty years
ago there were 50 per cent, more settlers
on the land, and more land was under culti-
vation than there is to-day. Many settlers
on the upper reaches of this beautiful river,
with its stretches of the finest agricultural
and dairying land in the State, are struggling
along with a few pigs and a small herd of
cattle. Others are trying to dairy, but are
heartbroken at having to send cream 40 or
50 miles over mountainous country to the
nearest factory. The cream, too. is classed
as second rate owing to the difficulties of
transit.... Another 12 miles up the river
is the mouth of Friday Creek. This magni-
ficent creek, which flows for many miles
through fertile country, and capable of
settling a large population, is as it was at
the beginning.”
The population of N.S.W. is about 50 per
cent, more than it was 20 years ago, and
the agricultural population of the Upper
Macleay, it appears, was 50 per cent, more
20 years ago than it is now. The shires had
fewer inhabitants at the last count than
seven years earlier, which is some corrobora-
tion. It isn’t a case of the need for “cutting
up the big estates.” These men with “a
few pigs and a small herd of cattle” never
hope to possess big estates
# * * $
Nor is the difficulty actual lack of popula-
tion. Apart from the Western Division,
N. S. Wales represents 183,957 square
miles, and for average density of popula-
tion it is not so far behind old countries
such as Norway, Russia and Turkey, while
it is far ahead of Bolivia, Brazil, Argentina,
Canada and other rising places. It has
about twice as many humans to the mile,
even with its Western District included, as
the whole division of the United States
which comprises Montana, Idaho, Wyoming,
Colorado, New Mexico, Arizona, Utah and
Nevada—eight States in all, measuring
859,009 square miles. Yet though N.S.W.
makes a fair show for people as compared
with space, it is behind both Victoria and
Tasmania. Victoria, with 19 inhabitants to
the mile, doesn’t compare so badly, consider-
ing its youth, alongside the United States,
with its all-round average of 35; yet Vic-
toria has. just “blewed” £31,000,000 of loan
money on a crazy scheme for putting
myriads of misfortunate settlers on pocket-
handkerchief farms, whereas the urgent
demand is for manufactures and rising in-
dustrial towns rather than for artificial
peasants. It may be added that even South
Australia and Queensland can beat one
State of the U.S.A. for overcrowding—on the
average, of course.
* * * *
The remark is even heard at times' that
rivers like the Upper Macleay and “stretches
of the finest agricultural and dairying land
in the State” do no particular good to the
State or the Commonwealth either, and that
even the “influx of people of British stock
to fill the country’s empty spaces” is a frost.
Taken on the w r hole, Australia isn’t doing
so badly in the matter of immigrants as
is sometimes supposed. Surplus of arrivals
over departures last year was 42,220, and
during the last five years it was 198,889.
The average annual gain by immigration
alone amounts to a new town the size of
four Qoulburns or two Broken Hills to
start with; but no one can find any new
towns, especially in the neighborhood of
the Upper Macleay. Adding gain by excess
of births and gain by excess of immigra-
tion, N.S.W .’s increase has amounted to a
fresh Newcastle and suburbs every two
years; yet nothing bright and new is visible
—certainly nothing on the Upper Macleay.
With each advance the community appears
to grow more dependent on foreign loans
and imports. As an example of helplessness
the Old Inhabitant already quoted pro-
ceeded with his tale:—
“Several years ago the settlers of Bell-
brook and Nulla Nulla Creek district sub-
scribed £3OOO to build a branch butter fac-
tory, but when the proposal came before
the departmental authorities they were, in-
formed that they would have to build accord-
ing to Government plans and specifications,
at an estimated cost of £7OOO. The scheme
was be.vo’ul their reach and the scheme was
abandoned.”
It was no vaulting ambition—just a butter
factory in a vast wilderness. But the
policy of the wonderful centralised Govern-
ment which thinks in billions at Sydney
made it impossible.
* * * *
The spots and spaces of a State which
realty is pretty well off for population, and
which is gaining population on a liberal
scale, yet shows hardly any signs of popu-
lation over most of its area, have been
dealt with by the State Statistician. He
gives figures up to 1924 in this way:—
Area Population per
(Sq. Miles). 10 Sq. Miles.
City of Sydney .. .. 5 218,360
Suburbs .. .. ... 180 50,161
Adjacent Municipalities.. 515 2,324
Country Municipalities.. 2,437 2,324
Country Shires . . .. 180,820 35
Western T)iv. (the unin-
corporated part)) .. 125,294 l
The total is good enough considering the
political youth of the State and the country;
but the distribution is characteristic of a
borrowing and importing freak. Land
settlement policies are useless where metro-
politan population preponderates and metro-
politan quidnuncs insist on regulating butter
factories hundreds of miles away, and milk-
ing the cow by telegraph. The* one promis-
ing remedy is separation, when it can be
brought about, and plenty of it. with Sydney
and some adjacent parts to run a commercial
city State as a separate institution.
THE BEST SIDE OF A GAOL DOOR.
About 50 years ago an interesting experi-
ment was begun in New York. The gaol
in those days was an incubator of criminals.
Treatment in the mass submerged the indi-
vidualism which under a more reasonable
system might have been turned to good
account. Accordingly what was known as
the Elmira Reformatory was established.
At its initiation its activities were limited to
males of from 16 to 30 years of age who
had "fallen” for the first time. It was
felt that this was the period in life in which
there was a reasonable prospect of rescue
and reform. It was within the power of
any Court in the State to send offenders
to this reformatory for an indefinite term
provided that the total period of detention
did not exceed the longest term provided
by law for the offence of which the prisoner
had been convicted. From time to time
amendments of the law have been made,
but its central principle remains unchanged.
The period of detention depended upon the
conduct of the confinee. The actual period
was determined on the basis of his con-
duct and fitness for release by the managers
of the reformatory.
British communities move slowly in re-
forms of this nature, though in our Common-
wealth we have for a number of years
adopted the principle of extending where
the Court thinks fit certain concessions to
offenders not previously convicted of an
indictable offence nor sentenced to penal
servitude or imprisonment for any less
offending. In such cases the so-called “first
offender,” having been duly convicted and
sentenced, is called on to enter into a
recognisance to be of good behavior for a
period equal to that of his sentence or
not less than 12 months and to report him-
self at fixed intervals as conditions upon
which his sentence will be suspended. The
recognisance may also contain other con-
ditions, as in the case of comparatively
recent N. S. Wales legislation by which the
offender may bo subjected to supervision
by a Probation Officer, and prohibited from
associating with thieves and other undesir-
ables or from frequenting their haunts. It
may require his abstention from intoxicating
liquor and provide generally for such steps
as will secure his leading an honest and
industrious life. The habitual criminal also
has received attention in what is practically
an indeterminate sentence, for having
served his term he may be further detained
until it has been decided that he has suffi-
ciently reformed.
In Maoriland this question has been
dealt with in a series of measures culminat-
ing in the Offenders’ Probation Act of 1920.
Under this law an offender may be re-
leased on probation for any offence punish-
able by imprisonment, irrespective of the
fact, that he is not a first offender. Also
it limits the maximum period of probation
to five years without reference to the term
imposed by the nature of his offence. Pro-
bation Officers are appointed whose duty it
is to make inquiries as to the character
and personal history of the offender and
report to the Court. Whilst on probation
he has to report in person or by writing,
as the Probation Officer may require, not
less than once every month. He must
sleep at the address given by him, unless
permission to the contrary is issued, and
notify any changes of address. The nature
and place of his employment must be made
known to and be approved by the Proba-
tion Officer. He must not associate with
any person or persons or with any class
of persons with whom the Probation Officer
has in writing warned him not to associate.
Finally it is the duty of this officer, if
satisfied in any case that the best interests
of the public and of an offender would be
served by his release, to recommend that
course to the Court.
In the last official report of the Chief
Probation Officer, he comments on the
steady increase in the number of persons
admitted to probation as indicating a grow-
ing confidence in the system. “The prin-
ciple of probation has now,” he says, “a
safe place in our system of criminal law.
and our efforts are in the direction of gradu-
ally enlarging its scope and establishing an
ideal and inexpensive method of dealing
with offenders whom the Courts consider
worthy of an opportunity to prove their
desire to reform.” Persons other than first
offenders convicted and ordered to come up
for sentence when called upon come auto-
matically under the provisions of the Act.
Of the 586 persons in the Dominion who
were admitted to probation in 1924-25. only
43 failed to respond to the leniency offered
them, making the percentage of successes
92.66. The M.L. Crimes Amendment Act
of 1920 gives the Prison Board power to
recommend the release of hard-labor con-
finees as well as of those sentenced to re-
formative detention or declared to be habit-
ual criminals. Those prisoners are released
on probation and come under the super-
vision of the Probation Officers, who keep
in touch with them and “make every pos-
sible effort to prevent them from lapsing
into crime.” Employment is found for
them, so far as possible, out of the cities,
and away from old associates and other
temptations. There are altogether 185
Probation Officers in the Dominion. The
majority are members of the police force,
others permanent officers of the Prisons
Department, and five are volunteers, these
latter, with one exception, being officers of
the Salvation Army. Although the pre-
ponderating number of Probation Officers
are drawn from the police, the report states
that they are found to be “scrupulously
fair in their treatment of probationers. No
complaints whatever of harsh or unfair
treatment, either before or after conviction,
were received from probationers through-
out the year.”
In several directions the Dominion legis-
lation goes beyond that of any in the Com-
monwealth. It has been in operation over


four years with a large measure of success.
Possibly it is easier to secure the close
supervision needed for success in a com-
pact self-contained Dominion with little
more than a million and a quarter popula-
tion than it would be on our continent with
approximately six million people scattered
over a wide territory; nevertheless, this
experiment in penology may be found in-
structive.
T. B. C.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Curse of the “Practical Politician.”
When Woodrow Wilson, aided and abetted
by Smuts and Hugh Cecil, imposed the
League of Nations upon a sorely-shaken
world, he underestimated the importance of
the “practical politician” with no nonsense
about him. His error was impressed upon
him when he returned to his own country,
and he died a sadder and a wiser man.
The idea that a mad world might be taught
sense and self-restraint, while it has always
seemed feasible enough to poets and
prophets, has never appealed, and is never
likely to appeal, to the type of man that
is best suited to survive the hurly-burly
of party politics.
For a time the idealists held the field.
The Covenant of the League was embroi-
dered and enlarged at successive post-war
conferences, and the Geneva Protocol was
hailed by optimists as a forerunner of the
Millennium. The Locarno Protocol went
one better, and apparently brought compul-
sory arbitration, guaranteed security and
progressive disarmament well within the
ambit of practical world-politics. France
accepted its principles as a League member;
Germany entered the League as a professed
supporter. Twenty-three other Powers,
mostly unimportant, gave assent. But the
last British Imperial Conference declared
that an undertaking to submit to compul-
sory arbitration was “premature” and de-
clined to sign Article 36 of the Statute of
the Permanent Court of International
Justice, though it was stated that the Con-
ference “favored the widest possible exten-
sion of the method of arbitration,” words
that in the circumstances didn’t mean any-
thing. The feeling of the ’ Premiers, evi-
dently, was that the arbitration idea was all
right for other people, maybe,' but, as sen-
sible men faced with practical problems of
statecraft, they couldn’t subscribe to such
a highly fanciful idea.
The refusal of the British Commonwealth
of Nations to accept the logical implica-
tion of the Covenant which each member
signed is not surprising when it is remem-
bered that some of the actual signatories
—Massey, of Maoriland, was the least am-
biguous—told their respective Parliaments
when they returned that the League was a
very pretty notion, but Britain wouldn’t
be safe without a big navy. As was astutely
remarked by W. Shakspeare, nothing is
either good or bad but thinking makes
it, so. So long as publicists and leaders of
political thought united in saying that the
League was good, it was good. But as soon
as they started to say that it was a pretty
theory but not a practical basis for the
ordering of international affairs, the League
became flyspecked and tarnished, and its
virtue went out of it. It is still the only
hope of a world that dreads unutterably a
repetition of the madness of 1914-18, and
lip-service is still given to it by all political
leaders who are not also military dictators.
But the Practical Politician doesn’t believe
in it, and whenever he gets the chance he
kicks away one of the props that hold it up.
If the Practical Politician could be told
in some unmistakable fashion that he
could do that sort of thing only at peril
of political extinction, he wouldn’t do it.
But he doesn’t hold his job because of his
attitude to world-politics. His connection
with international affairs is usually merely
an accident incidental to his firm attitude
towards the proposal to build a railway from
Bogg’s Corner to Pumpkinville or his un-
alterable determination to give every child
in his bailiwick the right to a free tooth-
brush.
<s,
The Reduction of Taxes.
Another effort is to be made to cut down
Federal taxation, and if it can be done as
the result of economies, it can’t be done too
quickly. But the danger about doing any-
thing rash and blindly is that taxation, or
at least the revenue from taxation, is so
very liable, at some early date, to reduce
itself.
In the last five post-war years, these have
been the principal features of Federal money
matters:—
Commonwealth Revenue.
1921-22. 1925-26. Increase.
Customs .. £17,328,310 £27,839.888 £10,511,578
Excise . . 10,302,049 11,358,990 1,056,941
Decrease.
Direct taxes .. 22,048,483 15,174,127 G,874,356
I ncrease.
Non-tax rerenue 15,218,204 17,912,801 2,694,597
The net increase was thus £7.388,760. But,
to begin with, the addition to the non-tax
income was to a great extent fictitious. The
Commonwealth borrowed a good deal of
money, on which it paid interest, and lent
the same to the States, from which it col-
lected interest; also it gained something
out of services and lost it in expenses. As
regards direct taxation, it cut that down by
nearly seven millions a year, and if the
customs revenue relapsed to the figure of
1921-22, or possibly to that of 1917-18,
which was millions, it would find that
the cutting even now has been overdone.
The customs receipts attained their pre-
sent proportions because phenomenal
foreign borrowings led to a phenomenal
influx of foreign goods (the influx rose from
103 millions to 152 millions), and these
goods paid a phenomenal amount of customs
taxation. The Federal Treasurer was a
man who was liable to have sudden and
wholly unreliable wealth thrust upon him
through the rotten finance of the States, and
to some extent he is still that kind of man.
But an honest effort is being made to
reduce foreign borrowings, and consequently
imports, and consequently customs revenue,
which will drop fully ten millions if Aus-
tralia buys only so much abroad as it can
honestly pay for. Then the Federal Gov-
ernment may, among other things, realise
that its £20,000,000 roads grant, spread over
10 years, was a very hasty proceeding.
♦
Centralisation Gone Mad.
One of the acts of Tom Mutcii during his
first period as N.S.W. Minister of Educa-
tion was to take away from the Govern-
ment Architect the renewal and erection of
schools, and to institute a special branch
of the Department of Education. The chaos
existing when the change was made necessi-
tated some alteration; but it is doubtful
whether the unsatisfactory condition of
school buildings will ever be remedied so
long as centralised authority is worshipped
as it is at present.
Schools, police buildings, railway-station
offices, post offices, fire stations, municipal
buildings, etc., are all the time being erected
or repaired. Private contractors, employees
of the Public Works Building and Con-
struction Branch, Education Department
repair staffs and Railway painting staffs,
each working independently, move down on
small jobs in the one district. Since the
activities of each group are limited, the
workmen traverse wide areas, crossing one
another’s tracks and frequently retracing
their own because of the interdependence
of painter, carpenter, bricklayer, etc. Costs
are inflated by excessive travelling and
transport expenses; supervision is inadequate
because of the wide area over which super-
vising officers have to travel; and varia-
tion of plans, which are often obsolete
through delays and red-tape, is difficult,
because the man on the spot must await
decisions from Sydney. From there, too,
the working gangs are recruited because
the country’s worship of a great metropolis
necessitates the drift of the father with
sons to the place w'here there is some likeli-
hood of the latter learning a trade, or be-
coming tram-conductors.
Sureljr it is not beyond the wit of official-
dom to devise a scheme whereby County
Councils would be charged with the main-
tenance of all public buildings, whether
Federal, State or Municipal, within their
boundaries?
♦
Murder and Politics.
The latest outbreak of ‘’gang warfare” in
Sydney has seriously alarmed the com-
munity. The Americans, who are suffering
much from this phase of crime, lay the
blame for it directly on the great increase
in the use of drugs, and the consequent
highly profitable illicit traffic therein.
Factions rob one another of their ill-gotten
gains when a chance occurs, with the usual
reprisals to follow. Nearly all are drug
users as well as traders, with the conse-
quent obliteration of moral responsibility.
It is notable that the increase in the drug
habit in Sydney and other large Australian
cities has been coincident with the increase
in violent crime.
So advanced is the organisation of this
species of savagery that the N.S.W. police
seriously stated that Sydney was to be
invaded on a given date by a gang of
Melbourne gunmen, coming over specially
to kill the slayer of one of their party a
few days earlier; and the police force is
to be augmented by a panic-stricken Labor
Government. It is the attitude of this
Government in refusing to carry out sen-
tences of capital punishment in any circum-
stances which has been a factor largely con-
tributing to the present astonishing situation.
The abandonment of capital punishment in
W.A. was followed by such an outbreak of
murder that it was hastily revived—with an
almost immediate slump in the homicide
rate. Under Labor Governments in Queens-
land and N.S.W. the same official Labor
refusal to consider the death penalty under
any circumstances has produced the same
criminal results, culminating, in the case of
N.S.W., in the present gangsters’ carnival.
Victoria, it is true, has had a mixed Gov-
ernment during most of the lifetime of the
new pushes; but in that State the weakness
of the police force and the appalling weak-
ness of the lower Courts has been a factor
in producing a general disrespect for the
law.
The latest S3 r dney outbreak is so impu-
dent a challenge to authority that its speedj'
extirpation must be the first duty of the
Government. It may lose a few votes in
the process, but there are some votes that
no Government can .seek and live.

The Mutton Trade Slump.
Dear Bulletin, —In the course of a dis-
cussion the other day as to ways and means
of resuscitating the almost defunct mutton
export trade, somebody daringly suggested
that the Federal Government be asked to
lower the standard of export quality. He
was immediately rsnt by the pack, the main
argument being the time-worn one of solici-
tude for our reputation as an exporter.
That’s all very well, and laudable enough
in its way; but if your best is not good
enough for one section of the trade and
too good for another, what is the use of
continuing to send it? We were told by a
man in the trade the other day that our
second and third grades brought better
prices than our first, as being more suitable
to the requirements of the only customers
we have. It stands to reason that we can’t
get a first-quality carcase off a merino sheep,
and until we do we haven’t a hope of getting
the cream of the trade away from Maori-
land and the home producer. The position
at present is that we are compelled, by
the Federal restrictions, to send over an
article largely unsuitable to the consumer,
and are, incidentally, exporting huge num-
bers of young wethers which could be much
more profitably employed raising wool for
another year or two. If our old ewes are
just as good—or, in the opinion of the expert
above alluded to, better—why not send
them?
Granted that the standard of export
quality must be kept up for the sake of
our reputation, there is no reason why the
principle should be strained to the point
of ignoring the requirements of the trade.
No other country does it. If they are par-
ticular at all as regards quality, then it is
in the way of seeing that only the best of
the suitable article is allowed to be sent.
We could do the same.—Yours, etc., Bouriu.

The Pacific Peoples.
Dear Bulletin, — “Feng-Shui” is wrong
about the Institute of Pacific Relations (B.
23/6/ : 27). He appears to confuse the In-
stitute conferences at Honolulu with the
meetings of the Pan-Pacific Science Con-
gress. Scientific subjects, strictly so called,
form no part of the Institute’s agenda,
which is concerned with social and political
problems. The only connection lies in this.
Members of the Institute believe that
advantage can be gained by studying such
problems with the objectivity which dis-
tinguishes the scientist, whatever may be
the conclusion reached.
The whole point is this. If the Insti-
tute’s representatives are to speak to Japs
and Chinese reasonably, they should know
what a few Australians think outside them-
selves. Hence the questionnaire recently
issued in Melbourne. Is this “academic
honsense”? Surely the time is past when
self-appointed authorities may represent
public opinion by repeating private con-
viction.
I don’t know whether the Institute will
be surprised to find that only nine out of
140 Australians thought the White Australia
policy was founded on economic reasons
alone. (These quite insufficient answers
were all which had been examined when I
spoke.) I spoke only for myself, expressing
my own surprise. I repeat it. The reason
most commonly suggested in discussion is
economic and not racial, especially Labor
opinion. Historically, undoubtedly it has
been the major reason. It is even more
surprising to find that 95 answers out of
140 based White Australia on racial reasons
and excluded economic ones. If it is so,
then the -world should know it. Finally,
I should say that the overwhelming majority
of members of the Institute, including my-
self, strongly favor the White Australia
policy. Our reasons may differ.
Absolutely no theory is sponsored by the
Institute. If White and “Native” can’t
mix, let us ascertain the facts, establish
the result and make it clear to the parties
concerned. And if the practice of ascertain-
ing the facts by disinterested inquiry neces-
sarily involves the condemnatory label of
“idealist,” then let us plead guilty.—Yours,
etc., P. D. Phillips.

The Land That Is Always Muddled.
When the Northern Territory was divided
by a line across the map, and the top bit
got the brightly original name of Northern
Australia, while the bottom bit received the
startlingly original name of Central Aus-
tralia, and a caravan of Commissioners was
sent up, some people thought a new era
had dawned. Latest reports are that the
dawn is postponed. It is said that the load-
ing and unloading of ships at Darwin is
slower than ever; this is one reason why
there are hardly any ships left, and why
it is expected that there will be less. In
the last year for which particulars are
available, 4526 tons of one thing and an-
other represented the whole exports. There
was also said to be, on a recent date, one
wharfie who spoke English and looked it.
The new officials have ill-defined powers
and duties, so that six of them may be on
one job while five other jobs are neglected.
Lately, so the story goes, all the brass hats
were away together inspecting the country,
which has been inspected pretty regularly
for 60 years, and they couldn’t even be found
by broadcasting. Still, when they can be
found, they refer almost everything to
Melbourne, same as the old mob did; but
Melbourne has given up answering to a
greater extent than ever.
The Centre and North would be born
again if the train from Adelaide came in
and went out once or twice a week, and
there were officers at Alice Springs and
Newcastle Waters where Government land
could be bought in reasonable areas, and
there was a constant coming and going of
white people who didn’t- talk a mixture of
Abyssinian and Sanscrit, and Darwin was
one of Australia’s gates just like Brisbane
or Fremantle.
The Blessings of Colored Labor.
“Si Anu”: Singapore, where the Base goes
ahead very slowly, doesn’t need to be told
that there is trouble in China. All the main
features of the argument are being repro-
duced in little on the crowded island. Every
Chinese political party has its branch and
every branch its secret service, and every
secret service is trying its hand as often
as it dares at murdering its opponents. As
in China, the colored population looks on
as if the events were happening in the moon
.—a murdered towkay’s body was left lying
on a playing field near Raffles Hotel for
24 hoprs before the police found it, the
thousands who passed the spot considering
it was none of their business.
As in China, the British are the main
objects of execration, and the trams of the
Traction Company, practically a municipal
concern, have been empty for a month be-
cause of a boycott, while the Chinese private
’buses have been crammed. The tension
broke when a crowd started demonstrating
on the subject of the Chinese revolution in
front of a police station. The Malay police
fired after a white inspector had been
assaulted, and six Chinese were killed and
several wounded. The worst feature of the
business was the attitude of the jury at
the inquest. Instructed by the coroner to
bring in a verdict that the deceased “died
of gunshot wounds inflicted by the police
while firing upon an unlawful assembly,” the
jury altered “unlawful assembly” to “dense
crowd.”
There isn’t much doubt that the Chinese
are going to be a lot worse before they get
any better in Malaya. They are in such a
large majority that it isn’t any wonder they
begin to think, they own the country.

Spahlinger Again.
“Claude Oesophagus” : The latest body to
investigate the claims of the Swiss scientist
Spahlinger is the Medical Committee of
the Welsh National Memorial Association.
It was not impressed. After various mem-
bers had gone to Geneva and seen as much
as they were allowed to see, they came
to the following conclusions: —
“(1) Spahlinger claims to have made
achievements far in advance of modern know-
ledge, technically, hut has produced no
adequate evidence in substantiation thereof.
Competent authorities have Completely failed
to obtain supplies of his preparations for
systematic tests.
“(2) His published clinical records are
neither complete nor concise enough to per-
mit scientific evaluation of treatment. In
cases wdiere his results have been good, they
can be easily paralleled by other methods.
“(3) The treatment does not offer any
certain cure for tuberculosis. Conclusive
evidence has not been forthcoming that it
lias materially altered the course of the
disease.
“(4) The application of public or other
funds towards the Spahlinger Institute
cannot be recominended by this committee.
The publicity campaign on behalf of the
Spahlinger movement is to be deprecated
as unjustified by the evidence so far adduced,
and to be deplored as raising false hopes in
the minds of the unfortunate sufferers from
the disease.”
It is very easy for a man working inces-
santly on one subject to get delusions about
it. The medical world knows this to its
sorrow, and therefore offers wholesome
scepticism to him who dramatically
announces specifics. Unfortunately, the
daily press omits to ask for considered
opinions on any new medical announce-
ment. The “scoop’s” the thing and truth
is left out of the reckoning. The result is
that not a year goes by without the daily
journals the world over decorating their
pages with big type concerning an alleged
cure. Cancer has been “cured” half a dozen
times since the war. Tuberculosis runs it
a close second. Sydney hasn’t yet forgotten
the painful results of a local announcement
three or four years ago.
Of all the workers in the field of con-
sumption, none has had a more open and
a fairer invitation to “deliver the goods”
than Spahlinger. Endless committees have
visited him, endless opportunities to place
all his cards on the table have been given
him; the net result has been—nothing.
All things considered, the next time Mr.
Charlton wants to put a vote-catching
->hnk in his party’s platform, he’d better
leave Spahlinger alone. That gentleman
really doesn’t give him a fair run for his
money.

“Wassie”: How’s this for a Government
Board? The other day, while I was working
the team at the far end of my block in the
Vic. Mallee, a car hove in sight, zigzagged
through the stumps and came to a halt
where I was working. I stopped the nags
and invited the visitors to come up to the
camp, where records were kept, but they
said there was no need to trouble about that.
They instantly got busy; two produced
notebooks and papers, and the third
juggled a typewriter from somewhere. Then
they started. One chap did most of the
questioning, the other did lightning calcu-
lations and the third was the recording
angel. They had my noddle working over-
time, and got me remembering everything
that had happened during the last seven
years—everything that mattered. They
were the newly appointed Soldier Settlers’
Advisory Board, and I have a notion that
they know how to start on their job, any-
way.

POLITICAL POINTS
Last week tile Queensland Government
issued a proclamation ordering all persons
living within 20 miles of Innisfail courthouse
to hand over their firearms, ammunition and
stocks of bombs and miscellaneous explosives
to the police magistrate for cold storage.
The shooting of a strike picket was the cause.
Very extensive powers of search are given t.o
the police, who, by the latest available figures,
number 1127 men, or 67 fewer than in 1915.
Perhaps wdiat Queensland really needs is a
militia on the plan of the United States.
There these local troops are equipped and
partly paid by the Federal Government, and
though they are for local police duty they can
be roped into the Federal army in time of
war. Apparently the State requires more
than its skimpy police force, for it is a big-
place and given to strange happenings.
Eight years ago Townsville (N.Q.) was
held for days by a motley crowd of rioters.
Later, a purposeless mob of 1000 took pos-
session of the Mount Morgan mine and drove
off the staff. On the third day of the
occupation the workings were found to be
on fire, and that was practically the end
of Mount Morgan. Then there was a strike
on the Government railways which ended
in a Victory for the Revolution, some of
the winners proclaimed. There were strikes
in the sugar country, especially about the
waterfront, in 1925, and there is another
upheaval in the same parts now. Do the
people who engineer, these things want to
show that Labor Government is a failure?
When all the accounts are in 1926-27 will
probably prove the record year for loans
(apart from war loans). It should beat even
1925-26, when Australia added almost
£45,060,000 to its total liabilities, and hadn’t
one outstanding public work to show for the
lot. During the year just closed the N.S.W.
Government alone contrived to gather in
£19,236,674 of borrowed money, and it gave
its lOTJ for a good deal more than that.
Three things go together with mechanical
regularity—big external loans, big imports
and a big scarcity of local employment, for
a community can’t buy an immensity of
goods from outside cheap laborers, piece-
workers. non-unionists, niggers and sundries
and yet have the job of making the goods.
The speech which the Hogan Labor Gov-
ernment put into the mouth of Baron Somers
at the opening of Vic. Parliament was the
mildest production of the kind for years.
There was nothing to jar on the suscepti-
bilities of His Ex., a good Conservative mem-
ber of the House of Peers, during the eight
minutes he was reading it. Several times
something was very nearly said, but the
something, whatever it was, seemed to have
been eliminated in the last revision. There
was mention of Rural Bank, Spencer-street
Bridge, Greater Melbourne and Outports
bills, and a promise was given of an Assem-
bly Redistribution Bill during this Parlia-
ment, but not necessarily this session. After
that came a programme that any Tory Gov-
ernment might have submitted.
Until an Opposition leader has been chosen
the immediate ex-Premier has a sort of pre-
emptive right to the centre position on the
front Opposition bench in Vic. Assembly. An
alert John Allan could have been the man
in possession when the House assembled to
be sworn in and to choose a Speaker. As it
was, the Left was leaderless when congratu-
lations to newly-clcctcd Speaker Snowball
were being handed around ; it was an hour
later before McPherson became Opposition
leader. Later in the day there were too
many leaders. Allan (Cocky) showed that
he was no more prepared to leave it to
McPherson (Nat.) than Dunstan (Country
I’rog.) was ready to leave it to Hogan
(Lab.).
Kevin O’Higgins, Minister of Home Affairs

THE IMPORTANCE OF PICKING YOUR CRIME.
“Vic. Commissioner of Police Blarney complains that if a man lavs dishonest hands on an article
of food which he may need he is guilty of theft, while if he lays dishonest hands on a motor-car he
can be punished only for illegally using, with its lighter penalty.”
THE INSIDER: “I took a wheelbarrow to help me earn a meal and they gave me three

Sunday by three gunmen in a stolen motor-
car while on his way to Mass. The foul
deed removes a doughty defender of the
Treaty, but it is the Republican cause that
will suffer, though the Republican leaders
(honestly, no doubt) pronounce it guiltless.
Ireland has no worse foes than the degenerate
sons ’tvho commit such crimes, believing that
Republicanism can be promoted by savagery.
From an advertisement recommending the
“Protestant Labor” candidate to the electors
of Port Adelaide
W. P. J. Skelton, M.L.A., saved the New South
Wales Labor Government frcin defeat when pledged
A.L.P. men deserted.
It is true enough ; and then he allowed it to
be well understood that he wouldn’t refuse
an appointment as Railways Commissioner.
Judge Beeby’s post-dated authorisation of
the piecework system in the engineering
trades caused large and snortful meetings to
gather in Sydney and Melbourne. The Syd-
ney one passed a terrace of resolutions with
intense vigor; among other things, it “en-
dorsed the decision of the All-Australian
Trades Union Congress” that when anybody
is suspected of doing piecework, and doesn’t
prove his innocence (apparently it isn’t a
question of anybody definitely proving his
guilt), he shall be declared “black.” Yet
shearers, coal-miners and cane-cutters keep
on the old way, and are not blighted by fire
from heaven as were poor old Sodom and
Gomorrah.
Fantastic is the proposal that members of
the League of Nations should be compelled
to back financially any member attacked. The
contributions, it is suggested, should be pro-
portionate to the size of each nation, and the
estimate is that Britain would have to pay
four times as much as the next largest
Power. The favorite Balkans and Baltic
game of twisting the next-door neighbor’s
tail could thus be made a means of squaring
a Government’s ledger. There is nothing
like a war for stimulating some industries,
provided outside credit is good, and in this
case the enterprise would be backed by the
credit of half the world.
News from Central Australia is that the
Bruce-Page Government is constructing 20
more miles of the Soutli-to-North railway
(the obsolete 3ft. Gin. concern) by day labor,
and is making infinitesimal progress'. Ten-
ders have been called for a further exten-
sion to a dead end at Alice Springs, but
tlie results are wrapped in mystery. Sonic
construction is said to be under way in the
Territory itself, but nothing has been heard
of it for a good while. The 8.-P. Ministry
will never make a holy show of its collar
with perspiration.
J. E. West. M.11.K.. writes (in the worst
list in the world) rc his proposal to estab-
lish an agricultural research laboratory at
Canberra :
This Bi'ii i.etin objects tliut the Canberra climate
ia too severe. But with coal, oil and electricity
available, that won’t matter to a research insti-
tute. Great work is being done or has been done in
Moscow, Paris'and Edinburgh, 1o mention only three
places with severe winters; and don’t forget that
our own Farrer did all his earlier work at Canberra.
Queensland has issued a preliminary esti-
mate of its railway deficit for the year to
June 30. It is the 12tli consecutive shortage
—one for each year of the long-lived Ryaii-
Theodore-Gillies-MeCormack Ministry—and
it is the record for the State and for Aus-
tralia, the amount being £1,943,500. The
drought is, of course, partly responsible, but
there was a shortage of £1,581,000 in 11)21
and almost as much in 1922 without a
drought. The big increase in charges made
in 1924-25 brightened the situation for a
while, but the gain was promptly absorbed
in additional working expenses. The soul-
weary Cabinet has announced that no new
railway construction will be attempted for
12 months, and a number of scraps on which
work has been suspended will probably re-
main suspended.
Chief See. Preudergast will have to pick
his steps more carefully or lie will be embar-
rassing the Vic. Labor Ministry. To a depu-
tation of church folk who asked him to close
the pubs on Christmas Day and Good Friday
he conveyed the impression that a Redistri-
bution of Seats Bill was to be. rattled
through and an appeal then made to the
country. lie did not quite intend to say
that, but said it was. Next day the Gover-
nor's Speech intimated that any time would
do for the Seats Bill. Parliament having two
years and nine months still to run. Prendy
must have been “told off” by some of his
fellow-Ministers’ at a Cabinet corroboree, as
lie was ruffled afterwards.
Having entered formal protest by the
orthodox procession through London, English
unionists will doubtless settle down to live
peacefully under their new trades-union law.
If prohibits anybody intimidating others by
picketing their homes to make them join in
a strike, and it prohibits compulsory contri-
bution toward Labor candidates’ election ex-
penses. Most, unionists may feel better for
both changes when they get used to them.
N.S.W. Industrial Commissioner Pidding-
ton (“Good old Piddo”) left for a sea voyage
after fixing up the increased basic wage with
the child endowment'added, and after assur-
ing the community that things were so fixed
this time that increased prices wouldn’t fol-
low on increased wages and charges. But
instead of proceeding to Honolulu lie got
off at Auckland and turned his hurried bow-
sprit for home. Perhaps he was disquieted by
the news that N.S.W. railway expenses are
going up half-a-million per annum by reason
of his verdict and that railway charges are
consequently to rise, and steamboat charges
are rising also, and that concerns which
work on small margins of profit are anxiously
considering how to do with fewer employees.
Child endowment and employment insurance
and a number of 44-hours decisions, especi-
ally the last, came ou top of each other so
fast that there was hardly time to get used
to the new conditions.
One of 'the Slang Government's election
boasts has been that N.S.W. produces more
in proportion to population than any other
place on earth bar the United States, the
fostering care of the Slang-whangs being, of
course, responsible. The State’s own figure-
man has published that N.S.W. produced, in
1924-25, all sorts of things to a value of
£74 Is. 9d. per head. The Federal man
sets down the average for the Common-
wealth in the same year as £76 9s. sd.
apiece, which puts N.S.W. in the background.
The Queensland authority says that liis
State’s record was £B2 6s. 4d. and the Maori-
land gentleman puts in a claim for £B4
19s. 2d. So perhaps it is best to assume
that the Slangwliangs are wrong as usual.
Premier Hogan did some refreshing talk
about Victoria’s finances when he was bid-
ding for office, and hopes are entertained in
sanguine quarters that his actions now that
lie is in office will be vigorous and refresh-
ing likewise. There was an accumulated
deficit in 1925, and the Allancocks have added
two deficits since; also they borrowed
£15,000.000 or so. The Commonwealth loan
which has mostly been left frozen on the
underwriters’ hands in London is partly for
Victoria, and that won’t improve matters.
Yet Hogan’s land is far the least taxed of
the States, so it has the most spare re-
sources to draw upon. It has still the
smallest debt per head despite its Lawsons
and Allancocks. and it has the biggest sink-
ing fund save one.

“Verri”: The Eehunga jam and pickle
strike (B. 7/7/’27) recalls some similar hap-
penings in Maoriland. On one of the coastal
boats the crew demanded ham-and-eggs, ordi-
narily a Sunday dish, for week-day break-
fasts, and struck when the request was
refused. After reducing the company to sub-
mission and consuming the fare demanded
for a fortnight they struck again, the cause
officially given being too much ham-and-egg.
But it remained for the men of a small coal
boat to provide something unique in what
was known as the “vanity strike.” These
downtrodden wage-plugs went out because
of the refusal of the owners to provide

“ Flagwagger ” :
Twelve years ago I
saw a strange meet-
ing b e t w e e n
brothers. A Mel-
bourne family had
broken up after the
death of the
mother, and the two
sons, Jack and
Arthur, soon lost
all trace of one an-
other. On the out-
break of war Jack
enlisted in the
A.I.F. and was
drafted into the
23rd Battalion,
where I made his
acquaintance. We
left Egypt for An-
zac on a troop-
ship, and were
transhipped at Mu-
dros to a British
man-of-war. At one
of the crew of the
latter Jack was dis-
covered looking
long and hard.
“Aren’t you m y
brother Arthur?”
he said at last.
Arthur it was who
in 1912 had worked
his passage to Eng-
land on a tramp-
boat, and afterwards, stranded and broke,
had joined the Navy. A few hours
later the brothers parted again, this time
for ever. Jack was killed at the end of
November, when Lone Pine received the
heaviest shelling of its eventful history.

“Bad Australian”: Touching the relative
merits of the revolver &ud. uutomßtic (£>.
7/7/’27), in the matter of accurate shooting
and penetrative power there is little to
choose between the two, provided the
weapons used are of the same quality, calibre
and length of barrel. But the mechanism
of the revolver is simpler than that of the
automatic; and, moreover, when an empty
shell jams in the latter it holds up the
whole box of tricks, whereas with the re-
volver a jammed shell doesn’t matter; an-
other pull on the trigger brings the next
cartridge under the striker. I am not in
the least impressed by the preference which,
according to “Spare Sub,” is given the auto,
by the cheap city squibs who have lately
taken to carrying guns; their testimony
would be more valuable on the subject of
beer bottles and sandbags.

“F.S.”: Despite “Momokeni’s” denial (B.

bathing to be seen in Sweden if you travel
far enough. I have seen whole families
on the banks of the Gotha Canal as naked
and innocently unself-conscious as ever were
Adam, Eve and their brood. Fashionable
watering-places like Marstrand indulge m
a modification of the idea. The public baths
are divided for the sexes and costume is
not necessary in either section. There is a
small sea-gate to each division and you may
do your mixed bathing outside if you wish.
During a yachting cruise of the Bohuslaan,

“Ibn El Issar”: There is something
humorous to those who know Egypt, in the
cabled announcement that no alcohol was
served at the Guildhall banquet in London
to King Fuad on account of that monarch s
“religious susceptibilities.” Among the many
followers of the Prophet there is no more
determined and assiduous imbiber of the
forbidden juice than the Egyptian. Begin-
ning with the lowly shadoof worker, who
enlivens his existence with home-brewed
date-arrack, the taste ascends through the
“notable,” with his aniseed brandy, to the
nobility, whose pet swig is sweet French
champagne, specially made for the Gyppo
trade. There are about a thousand queerly-
named drinks with even queerer flavors in

Moslem tippler, being compelled to drink
with the flies, or at all events in close
seclusion, likes something that gets busy
early.

“J.E.”: In one morning's papers lately I
came across seven instances of serious
crime in which the defendant ascribed his
downfall to drink, and added that his mind
being consequently a blank it was no use
asking for details. The cases included two
homicides, one robbery with violence and the
matter of the bold, bad British baronet who
is serving six months’ imprisonment for
covering a nude young lady with boot var-
nish in the small hours of the morning and
leaving her to graze in timbered country. By
way of keeping pace with the times I have
been moved to write a story on these lines
myself. The hero, who is also the villain,
is head of a great financial institution, the
Hebrew, Latin and Sanscrit Bank. In the
course of a few busy years lie loots it of
some millions, and finally takes refuge with
his booty in Spain, with which country there
was then no extradition treaty. There he
acquires an estate, a castle and a title. In
a quantity of pathetic and repentant letters
he ascribes his downfall to drink, sudden
temptation and the gambling mania, he
having once backed a horse at a country race
meeting. He also says that he is the victim
of a hereditary taint, his stepfather having
been out of his mind and his brother-in-law
being addicted to malt liquors. In addition
he explains that his mind is a blank. Letters
suggesting a refund of the money evoke no
response. His castle being within sight of
the French border, ruined depositors occa-
sionally go to look at it and consider how
near the defaulter is and yet how far. When
I have finished the tale I think it will depict
a much-misunderstood victim of circum-
stances, one even more deserving of sympathy
than the baronet who boot-blacked the nude
girl in a tense moment.

“Woolongoon”: About those infallible
communication-cords in Vic. trains (B.
30/6/’27). I’d put a number of cases on the
van one day, and taken a seat in a carriage
half-way up the train. Just as the train was
starting I looked out of the window and saw
my cases, as I thought, on the platform. For
the next five minutes I made frantic efforts
to get the communication-cord to work. First
I hauled in the direction in which the arrow
points, then I tried the other way, and
finally I swung on it. It was all futile, and
at the next stopping-place I did even time to
the guard’s van and was pleasantly aston-
ished to find that my cases were still on
board. Another commercial, it seemed, had
left the train at the station where I joined
it and it was his cases I had taken for my
own. If that cord had been all right my pre-
cipitancy would have cost me anything up to
£2O. Yet every time it is in a faulty con-
dition human lives may be endangered.

“Robert Bruce” : The country mailman has
much to do besides deciding whether overlooked
letters are important enough to necessitate a
return trip (B. 16/6/’27). His commissions
varv from paying in bank deposits to pur-
chasing babies’ dummies, and occasionally
he must memorise a list of symptoms to
recite to the nearest medico on some suf-
ferer’s behalf. Grocery orders are regular
and interpretation is not always easy. Re-
cently a Monaro mailman and the grocer had
to decipher what appeared to be “lib. eye-
mint.” Their verdict was “cement, though
the quantity seemed extraordinarily small.
Next trip down, a complaint was lodged.
“You tell Sands that was funny cinnamon
he sent up. The wife read where it was
good for flavoring rock-cakes but it only
made hers go real hard.”

“Raaj”: Quecrly-named thoroughfares ?
To-day when motoring from Newerybar to
Chine's (Vic.), I came on a large finger-
post on which was printed in bold letteis
“Virtues-road.” It looked so uninviting that
I kept straight on.
THE SILENCE OF THE PLAINS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Two horsemen rode the dusty track
They'd ridden since the morn ;
Two silent horsemen, long and lean,
Two wiry nags as e’er were seen,
Two saddles old and worn.
A sheaf of miles lay at their back.
From out the sullen, sombre maze
A blue-eyed stranger rode.
“Good-day,” he said. “Good-day,” they
drawled.
Their gaze was set, as though enthralled,
Upon a cloud that showed
Above the far horizon's haze.
Long had they pondered o’er that cloud,
A filmy, fleeting speck;
At length one slowly shook his head.
“I doubt we’ll get some rain,” he said,
And scratched his wrinkled neck,
Then stubbed his pipe and sighed aloud.
The air was like a furnace blast;
Ten dusty miles went by ;
The other’s brow was thick with thought;
Ilis eyes the far horizon sought;
He gently scratched his thigh.
“I ain’t so sure,” he drawled at last.
The stranger turned and left the track
And headed for the east.
“So long,” he cried, “I’m leaving quick;
This bloody wrangle makes me sick.”
He urged his willing beast.
They gazed at his receding back.
THE KNEW SHE’D MISLAID THEM. SOMEWHERE.
“Marie is sending to Paris for her clothes
“Gurron! Is that where she lift them?”
In crimson splendor flamed the west;
One long, lean man made tea.
“A mm cove that,” he slowly said.
“White-ants, I reckon, in his head.”
The other? Naught spake he
But chewed salt-beef with solemn zest.

J. 8.”: Tattooing is said to be
obtaining a mild vogue again in
other than nautical circles: there
are stories of romantic dappers
who carry a lover’s initials on some
inconspicuous portion of their
anatomy. But the modern prac-
titioner is a mere tyro beside some
of his predecessors. Probably the
Maoris were the sublime artists of
the craft, though the natives of the
Marquesas Islands may have ap-
proached them in prodciency. In the
very early days of tribal warfare in
Maoriland, the lighting men went
into battle absolutely naked, but
so elaborately tattooed from the
forehead to the knees that they
looked at a distance to be clad iii
armor. It was the wonderful
tattooing of Maori faces in the be-
ginning of the pakcha occupancy
in MX. (particularly in the North
Island) that made the horrible
trade in heads so prodtable. It is
on record that there were cold-
blooded traders out of Sydney who
would bargain for the artistically
ornamented head of an unsuspect-
ing Maori and have it delivered on
board before they sailed away.
These heads were sold at fancy
prices to collectors in different
Parts of the world, and no doubt
some of them are still preserved.
To-day, tattooing is a lost art in
Maoriland, like the marvellous old
wood-carving.

“Stellsby”: A few weeks ago a
Mildura (Vic.) resident asked
«>LO to broadcast an unusual mes-
sage. In 1921 two swagmen accom-
panied by a dog camped on the out-
skirts of the town. One day the
men failed to return to camp and
for six years a pathetically lonely
dog has awaited their return. The
faithful tyke has steadfastly ignored
all friendly overtures of the towns-
people, preferring to forage for its
food at the municipal tip, its rations
being surreptitiously placed there
by a few consistent animal-lovers.
It was hoped that the dog’s master
could be located through BLO, but
?? / ar ie . as n °t been found.
Perhaps this paragraph may reach
him —wireless sets are not, as a
rule, included in Matilda’s make-up.

“Pinnace”: The neatest way I
,f .2 : ; ask of liquor tapped
(B. _o/6/27) was 30 years ago,
when I was an A.B. on board the
Jlerman barque Beethoven lying
in the harbor at Buenos Ayres,
One night the ship’s carpenter came
into the fo’castle and mentioned
that he had overheard the old man
giving the mate directions to get
several casks of sherry out of the
hold m the morning. That was
enough for "Chips,” who was
already groping in his tool chest for

and a length of 3in. Manilla rope.
, ow , n the stuffy darkness of
the hold a cask of the wine was
propped across two cases, the dish
placed in the space beneath and a
"(Spanish windlass” rigged with the
rope and bars around the middle of
the cask. Then all hands heaved
on the bars. The rope tightened

: Speaking of mustard-gas (B.
-0/0/20 I was bringing a draft of repaired
casualties again tit back to the 44th Bat-
talion, and on arrival at Havre we had to
undergo the usual gas instruction prior to
joining our unit. The instructor was a
C ockney staff-sergeant-major who knew his
job, and who insisted among other things
that provided a man put his service gas-
mask on properly and promptly lie couldn't
be gassed. One Digger remained totally
unimpressed; he grumbled that he had put
lus adjective mask on, and found it didn’t
stop mustard-gas. The s.s.m. said that was
till nonsense, and asked the interjector where
he had been gassed. The sceptical one re-
torted that after putting his gas-mask on
he had sat on some ground that had been
well soaked with mustard-gas the night
before and that the consequences had utterly
destroyed his faith in the much-boomed
appliance.

“Wang”: There is at least one Melbourne
citizen who regards with disfavor the pro-
posal for dimming motor-cgr headlights as
a precautionary measure agairist accidents.
Ilis house stands on the corner of two streets,
and his bedroom window is so placed that
when cars turn the corner their glaring head-
THE MISCHIEF MAKER.
The spokesmen lor the metal-trade workers are furious with Judge Beeby for making an
aw aid under which employers and employed may co-operate for their mutual benefit, in order to save
Australian industry.”
THE MAN WHO TALKS: “Here, don’t you see what they’re doin’? Shakin’ hands, if you
please! Let’s break in and dong ’em one!"
lights shine right on the window. The other
night lie awoke just at the moment a car
turned the corner; the rays from its head-
11ft 1 its illuminated the room long enough to
enable the householder to see a man busy
at a wardrobe in the corner. The burglar,
realising that his presence was discovered,
rushed for the window and, pushing up the
sash, jumped to the ground. But his luck was
out. By the strangest chance the light that
had put him away came from the night-
patrol car, the occupants of which, hearing
the householder’s shouts and his wife’s
screams, rushed back to investigate, and
arrived just in time to nab Sikes as he
emerged from the front gate.

“Momokeni”: Most old Papuan residents
will feel a trifle sceptical about that “un-
supervised natiye medical patrol” said to
have been carried out successfullv. It is
very doubtful if any native work without white
supervision can hope to be successful in Papua
for many generations, least of all medical
work. Despite constant instruction and ex-
planation, a native, having performed any
given operation correctly 99 times, is liable
on the hundredth performance to experiment
to And out what will happen if he makes a
change. Some time ago at a Papuan medical
clinic a well-educated orderly had the task
of supplying patients with things prescribed
for them. For months, under a casual white
control, lie had duly administered doses of
quinine and bathed New Guinea sores with
lotion. Then one day he took it into his
head to reverse the treatment, and only
prompt measures prevented a catastrophe.
His only explanation was that lie “thought
he would change.” With the spread of edu-
cation the laudable ideal of Papua for the
Papuans may be realised some day, but it
won’t be in our time.

“Morice”: As far as my personal experi-
ence goes, a prematurely-born child, if a
male, very seldom lives; if a female, it has a
much better chance. In cases of delayed ges-
tation, the converse holds good; the males
being more likely to live and the females to
die. Of a dozen premature births I can re-
call, five were boys. All of them died, but
six of the seven girls lived—beyond the stage
of babyhood, that -is. I have known of only
three cases of delayed gestation : two (males')
lived; the one female died. It would seem
that sex has more to do with these matters
than is yet realised.

“X.N.0.”: There is nothing impossible
about radio music emanating from an iron
girder (B. 10/6/’27). Though not an
exactly parallel case, there is the historic
story of the Menai Bridge between the Welsh
mainland and Anglesey. A fiddler one time
day was tuning his instrument in the open
near the bridge and happened to strike re-
peatedly a chord to which the bridge responded
by starting to rock. If he had gone on,
there’s no knowing what mightn’t have hap-
pened. We may know a good deal about
wireless and music, but there’s still a lot
we have to learn.
“Ilerodot”: There is a very simple ex-
planation of the ship’s bell found in Torres
Strait without there being any record of
the loss of the vessel whose name it bore
(B. 2/6/’27). The bell doubtless came
originally from a ship called Sally which
was broken up and its fittings sold. I have
seen, at one time and another, at least half
a dozen ships’ bells bearing names other
than those of the vessels to which they be-
longed.

“C.Q.”: The hardest head in Melbourne
came into prominence the other day. Its
owner, a man of 45, stuck it out of a
cable-tram, and another tram travelling in
the opposite direction smote it When the
tough citizen was picked up off the road he
was found to be quite conscious and only
suffering from a few cuts, but the front
stanchion of the tram that tried conclusions
with him was wrenched out of its founda-
tions.

“Simon”: The finest optimist I ever knew
was the owner of - a Ford truck, lie was
committed on a charge of receiving, and.
after having been released on bail, drove up
in his truck to stand his trial. Before going
into court he hired a newsboy at sixpence an
hour to watch the machine, and with a
cheery “See you this after, sonny,” dis-
appeared—for eighteen months.

“C.Q.”: Melbourne Post Office employees
have done a fine work in installing, in their
own time and gratis, listening-in apparatus
at all the principal hospitals, but the scheme
has its disadvantages. On the operating-
table at the Alfred the other night a patient
while under the anaesthetic began to admin-
ister headlocks and scissors to surgeons and
assistants, and ended by throwing himself on
the floor. Inquiry elicited that he had been
listening earlier in the evening to the broad-
cast description of the Edwards-Thye wrest-
ling contest at the Stadium.

“Lightning ,1.”: Through one of the vag-
aries of radio, the British super-radio station
at Rugby, England, cannot be heard

made by numerous professional and
amateur operators to bring in this

of GBR has been caught. Ships’
operators, too, lose Rugby as they
approach Adelaide.

"Cartot”: Touching the poison-
ous possibilities that may lurk in
wall-papers or carpets (B.
23/6/’27), some years ago an out-
break of arsenical poisoning at
Oamperdown (Sydney) which at
iirst baffled the doctors was traced
to some wall-paper. The house be-
ing damp, an ordinary mould had
appeared on the paper and con-
verted the arsenic pigment into a
soluble form, after which flies had
carried the loosened stuff to the
food on the table. In another in-
stance, the poison was present in
the green dye with which the carpet
was colored. Bright sunlight shin-
ing on part of the carpet for several
hours a day reacted chemically on
it, and particles of poison were
carried up in the dust from the
floor and settled in the food. Seven
persons were affected.

“Lao-dah”: The Melbourne-
Geelong road is one of the remark-
able highways of the world. The
first track wandered through dense
scrub. To-day it flies straight as
an arrow through an empty land-
scape for miles and miies, and,
the surface being nearly perfect,
the speed maniac can travel at 60
m.p.h. with no particular danger
even to himself. It has been de-
cided to line the asphalt ribbon with
a quadruple belt of trees, and in-
numerable organisations are agitat-
ing themselves as to the best way
to do it. Every known species, in-
digenous and imported, has its
advocates, but for a start selected
portions are to be planted with
the evergreen cypress, golden
cypress, pepper-tree, Moreton Bay
fig, Canary Island pine, Queensland
box, white oak, camphor laurel,
cedar wattle, N.Z. laurel, yellow
box, various pines, an oak or two
and pink and crimson flowering
gums. The deciduous members
will be elm, poplar, American ash.
European ash, Turkey oak and false
acacia. If all survive the bitter
winds that rage across the plain
the route should some day be an
arboreal museum as well as a thing
of beauty.
, r ."f ri f : Forty years before
Michael Terry discovered the
waterless deserts” of Nor’-West-
ralia, the brothers McDonald, of
Goulburn (N.S.W.), heading in
the same direction, were establish-
ing what is still a record in Aus-
tralian overlanding. They travelled
with 1000 head of cattle and other
stock, a team of bullocks and a
waggon from Goulburn, through
Queensland, the Gulf Country and
the Northern Territory, right into
the heart of the Kimberley district
of W.A., and located their stock on
the country between the Margaret
and Fitzroy Rivers. It took them
three years to do the journey, and
when they arrived at their destina-
tion the cattle looked well and
their waggon and team were in
good order. Incidentally they had
opened up a stock route across the
continent.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The Poet remembered a far-off night
When he was young and alone,
And a song o’erheard and a lovers’ moon
Had forced from his heart a groan.
He remembered it well, with a pitying smile
lor the huge woes of youth ;
Then put it in verse with practised skill.
And an added beauty and truth.
The grief-born poem became a cheque;
“Heart-throbs are cheap to-day.”
Quoth he, and for his daughter small
He bought a jumper gay.
Love and art and money and love—
Thus the queer cycle goes;
What was the source of Shakspeare's brain
Or the beauty of a rose?
Sages affirm force cannot die
But only change its form :
So a twenty-year-old grief may help
To keep a youngster warm.

“Windsor": Determining the reasonable-
ness of arguments for and against the de-
licensing of pubs is no easy matter at any
time, but a country Bench had an extra-
knotty problem to grapple with the other
day. A wine-saloon proprietor of Lockhart
(N.S.W.). after lodging an application for
renewal, himself came forward to oppose the
granting thereof on the ground, among others,
that it would “destroy the quiet and good
order of the district.” Gross-examination
failed to disclose whether the change of
attitude was due to the Yes-No vintner hav-
ing been caught in a wave of Prohibitionist
feeling, but it established that he had actu-
ally canvassed the district seeking signatures
for a petition against his own application.
Entering into the humor of the situation,
the beak amiably decided that there was
nothing against the house and that the
license would be renewed.

“Momokeni”: Hermit Island, in the
lagoon of Rossel Island, Papua, is one of
the loneliest specks I have ever visited. The
accepted explanation of the name is that a
solitary Chow lived there for half a century.
He was the lone survivor of a shipload of 4(H)
Chinks who were wrecked on the outer reef,
rescued and placed on the small island by the
natives. Plenty of food was given them, and
when they were in prime condition, a few
100 PER CENT. OFF.
“Hello, sweet one! Walking to reduce?”
“No, worse —reduced to walking.”
at a time were transported to Rossel, where
they were duly cooked and eaten. The last
few dozen, it seems, got an inkling of their
prospective fate, and the one who was left
till last became a raving maniac. As the
mentally deficient are always well treated by
the Papuan natives, he was permitted to live
to a ripe old age, well cared for and un-
molested. To this day the natives of near-by
islands throw the unkind gibe at the Rossel
Islanders: “You savee kai-kai Chinaman
too much.” The slur is hotly resented, but,
whatever may be the reason, no native will
land on the island by either day or night.
It is a lucky housewife nowadays who gets
a Rossel Islander as a cookie boy, for, what-
ever their tastes in roast and boiled may have
been in the past, they make the cleanest and
most obedient servants of any Papuans.

“Strict Veg.”: A young man intruded on
the rejoicings at a wedding breakfast in a
Melbourne seaside suburb the other day and
attacked the bridal cake, inflicting damages
assessed at £1 I Is. fid. Two pounds worth
of injury was suffered by the floor and sundry
jellies and trifles sustained mortal wounds.
Also crockery valued at £0 Bs. fid. was
destroyed. The wrecker claimed to be a vic-
tim of unemployment maddened by the sight
of so much expensive food, but his wife
declared that he was annoyed because she
was invited to the feast and he was left
out. Two pounds and costs was the beak’s
opinion of the incident.

“Bumpkin”: Shipwrecked passengers from
ocean liners will have to work for their
living in the future. The latest type of
lifeboat, the Fleming, has two rows of handles
alongside the seats which are geared to a
propeller so that a boatload of refugees com-
pletely ignorant of seamanship can drive
themselves along at a speed of five knots, in-
stead of dying of thirst in picturesque atti-
tudes, as of yore. The Orvieto brought the
first examples of this new contraption into
Melbourne the other day.

“T.R.H.” : The old idea of the purposes for
which “the colonies” were intended still lin-
gers in some English minds. A young
Londoner, recently assisted to emigrate to
Canada by a benevolent society, was arrested
for passing imitation sovereigns. He had fiO
of them which, he asserted, had been given
him by his mother. The mother in London
frankly admitted that she gave them to the
boy. “I knew they were not good ones,” she
added. “My ’usband’s doin’ time for makin’
’em, but there’s real gold in ’em and I thought
they were good enough for Canada!”

“Jobber”: A gent, one of my acquaint-
ance had an articled clerk who was a whale
on Shakspeare, but none too sound about
Coke and Blackstone. The boss left the
office one afternoon, after instructing the
clerk to prepare a rather complicated mort-
gage ; on his return he found the youth
gone; a slip of paper on the table read:
“Macbeth, act —, scene —, line —.” Out
of curiosity, the boss turned it up and
immediately grasped the position. The line
in question runs: “I cannot do this bloody
deed.”

“C.C.”: I have met many people who share
“Bouragi’s” antipathy towards missionaries
(B. 26/5/’27), among them an individual
who feelingly remarked to me on one occa-
sion, “If it weren’t for that crimson mission-
ary up there on the hill I’d be able to do just
as I liked.” Still, the much-criticised class
is frequently useful if not invaluable to the
pioneer and trader, as when mission nurses
were able to succor the victims of a dysen-
tery outbreak on the New Guinea goldfields
manv years ago, and also when (as occurred
six months ago over Roper River way) the
mission station provided sanctuary for some
trepang-getters who had incurred the fierce
displeasure of a bush tribe. Generally
speaking the trader who hasn’t left his
code of morals at home gets on all right
with the missionary; considering how often
the latter has to act in an official capacity for
the Government, it would be strange if he
did not sometimes run foul of business enter-
prise. I’m not alleging that all traders are
dishonest exploiters of the native, or that
the pioneer is invariably a law unto himself;
some of the finest men I know are amongst
my trader and bush-pioneer friends. But the

missionary, too often earns a reputation for
himself that condemns the whole class. “Bou-
ragi” has evidently suffered in the past as a
result of the difference in apprehension of
moral values between himself and some too-
zealous propounder of Christian ethics, and
places all missionaries on his index in con-
sequence. Others, however, have had happier
experience.

“Fitz.” : I take the following from an old
scrap-book; the cutting is from a newspaper
published in July, 1870: “The largest tree
in the neighborhood of Sydney—and prob-
ably the largest in this part of Australia—
is a red gum-tree which stands a few hun-
dred yards from the road leading from St.
Leonards to Lane Cove and about 6J miles
from Milson’s Point, North Shore. It is
about 45 feet in circumference, and presents
a unique appearance, inasmuch as the trunk
is like a champagne bottle in shape. This
curiosity, although so near Sydney, is almost
unknown. The section of the famous ‘Wel-
lingtonia,’ sent from San Francisco to the
Crystal Palace Exhibition, was several feet
less in girth than this giant of the forest,
which has evidently survived a determined
attempt to burn it down.” No doubt the
historic tree has long since disappeared, but
there must be many who remember it. When
did it go?

“Uramao”: Tourists round the South Sea
islands should beware of giving their
addresses to the little Indian boys who
chum up to them in Suva. I was weak
enough to accommodate an obliging young-
ster in this way a year ago, and ever since
I have been bombarded with letters asking
for such things as shoes with crepe soles,
cameras, nice shirts and ties, and also a
passport to enable the writer to come to
me, the writer apparently regarding me as
a sort of patron saint. Though only about
12, his latest communication gravely set
forth that he would “tell me about his heart.”
He is going to get married and urges me
to send him “anyting nice from beatiful Nil
Zeland for lovely Indian girl.” Child-
marriages are the vogue in Fiji, as in India.
I have since erased the prospective bride-
groom from my list of correspondents, lest
he descend on me with his “beatiful girl.”

“Swiss”: My first introduction to “The
Wild Scotchman” (B. 23/6/’27), whom I
found a simple and likeable soul, was a
curious one. Many years after his release,
whilst on a political mission in the far north
of Queensland, I stayed a night in a com-
fortable little hotel. At breakfast next morn-
Ing, having need of the information, I
remarked casually to the proprietor: “I
don’t suppose you have any connection
with your bushranging namesake.” A glance
at his face gave me all the answer I wanted
and more. I can also remember a much
younger brother, who, in his early manhood,
had been forced to endure so much insult
about the relationship that he quietly went
to Brisbane, and took boxing lessons from
the celebrated “Black Diamond.” After his
return home the first man who mentioned
the blot on the family escutcheon had every
reason to regret his ill manners. Thereafter
the young man was permitted to live the
peaceful life that Nature had intended him
for.

“Dr. Gall Stones”: My wife bought six-
penn’orth of mothballs from a lady can-
vasser to put in amongst her summer clothes.
She considered them superior to any she
had ever bought and called my attention
to their size and pungency. In a few days
the coating peeled off and plum stones were
revealed.

“Pat Busliie”: How’s this for the casual
(or should it be resourceful) Australian?
A young Newcastle (N.S.W.) miner, out on
strike and receiving Government relief,
pawned his bike, the only asset he possessed,
to raise the registrar’s fee for marrying him.
Next day he applied at the local police-
station for the extra relief given to a
married man.

“X2X”: There is nothing extraordinary
in deaf people hearing wireless broadcasting
through the ear-’phones (B. 2/6/’27). I
know of one Sydney woman who is quite
unable to hear anybody even when they shout
alongside her, but who, nevertheless, has
enjoyed wireless programmes nightly for the
past 12 months. I also know a returned
soldier whose sense of hearing was utterly
destroyed through war injuries but who
nevertheless has successfully experimented
with wireless and managed to pick up a
number of distant stations. The cause of
these phenomena is still obscure; but it is
possible that medical research, which is being
assiduously prosecuted, may result in dis-
coveries which will lighten the burden of
deafness.

cently invited to send along names for a
baby girl. Among the suggestions were
Chrystella, Electra, Radiette, Aerial, Etheria
and Antenna.
THE DEVIL AND GEOGRAPHY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Preaching in Westminster Abbey, Dean Inge said
that Christianity had been secularised. People no
longer believed in a geographical Heaven or Hell.”
You were sceptic before? But it brings
Conviction, I think you’ll admit,
This positive dictum of Inge’s
Deleting the Bottomless Pit.
Now the flames that eternally spit
And the fumes of sulphurous smell
May right off our reckoning be writ;
There’s no geographical Hell.
Ah, Omar, what numbers of things,
Eight centuries back and a bit,
You knew ere theology’s kings
Their hoary old dogmas should quit.
To think, with a lamp that you lit,
A Dean should our darkness dispel
And into oblivion hit
The old geographical Hell!
Old Persian and Pagan! What rings
You ran in rubaiyats that flit
Round rubrics and edicts in strings,
Round creeds that dissever and split!
You cleared your Mahometan kit
Of torture eternal and fell;
Now it won’t into Christendom fit,
That damned geographical Hell.

It’s a myth that is shattered and split,
A bogey, a figment, a sell.
No more need it scare us a whit;
There’s no geographical Hell.

Goodyear now announces
A NEW-TYPE TREAD
for the Balloon Tyre
Here you see displayed for the first
time Goodyear’s latest contribution to
the Australian motorist—an improved
new-type tread for the balloon tyre.
As is apparent, it is a development
of that most famous of all treads,
the Goodyear All-Weather, now
re-designed in the light of new
balloon tyre knowledge.
The first advantage to you of this
new Goodyear tread is greater
traction and non-skid efficiency.
This is achieved not only by placing
the diamond-shaped All-Weather
blocks in the tread’s centre, but also
by flattening the profile of the tyre
to ensure broader road contact.
The second advantage to you is
improved tread-wear , accomplished
by the flat design, and by placing
two circumferential ribs in the tread
at the points of greatest wear.
The new All-Weather balloon tread
wears evenly and smoothly without
wavy spots or pot-holes, and at
any given mileage shows less wear
and less obliteration of the non-skid
design than is the case with earlier
types.
In addition to these important bene-
fits, the new Goodyear tread makes
fior longer tyre mileage, fior quiet
and smooth running, and fior an
even better-looking tyre.
You will want this new tyre for the
same sensible reasons that for years
have made “more people, the world
over, ride on Goodyear Tyres than
on any other kind.”

The A.P.A. is divided into factions which
tight like the devil for (they say) love of
the co. Most cos. make mistakes but hide
them as quickly as they can and, if possible,
forget them. This one is different—it is
run almost on Party Government lines. The
Government for the time being having found
some questionable transaction carried through
by its predecessor, paints it with the blackest
pitch. The Opposition replies that the trans-
action would have turned out quite differ-
ently if the Government had given it a
chance; and then, assuming an air of utter
martyrdom, it proceeds to empty the pitcli-
pot over the Government. This sort of thing
may be put up with in politics, though even
there it is only suffered because the system
is very old and suits the book of the
politicians, who are mostly humbugs; but
it is a different matter in business. What,
for instance, should wo think of the Bank
of N. S. Wales if there were two or more
factions scrambling in and out of the board-
room, one screeching at the top of its
voice that the advance to Smith was a rot-
ten one and probably lined some officer's
pocket into the bargain; while the other
tried to out-yell it with the information that
Jones’s overdraft would never have been
granted if one of the directors hadn’t stood
in with him. If the Bank of N.S.W. car-
ried on in such a fashion, not in a sudden
outburst of madness but almost as a matter
of policy, year after year, how much of
the public’s deposits would it expect to hold?
Yet here is a case in which the . public’s
deposits are being asked for not for a mere
six months or so, but for 20, 30, it may be
40 years. That is what life-insurance means:
you must trust these people for a fixed period
<>f perhaps 21 years or till death, though
your expectation of life may be 40 years.
And, so far as the Life Department is con-
cerned, and it is infinitely the most impor-
tant, everything depends upon the co.’s
ability to win that trust; it can make no
profits without it. How can it expect to
will the vast confidence which a life-insurance
policy or ought to imply, so long
as the business is carried on in the manner
just described?
Most of the present report is taken up
with comments —very acid, some of them —
on past transactions. Those transactions
may or may not be as bad as they are said
to be. The “Wild Cat” doesn't know'; in
any case it refuses to do either policy-
holders or shareholders the bad service of
spattering the co.’s past with more pitch.
To clean up a mess is one thing; to hire the
Town Hall and a brass band to make the
horribleness of the mess known is’quite an-
other. So the “Cat” will jump down to the
point at which the present directors report
that they find £368.000 of froth and fiction:
Establishment as at Dee. 31, 1925 . . . . £110,099
Purchase account as at Dec. 31, 1925 .. 84,503
Amount paid in excess of par value of
L.C.A. shares . . . . . . . . 141,840
Amounts paid under agreements wrongly

Amount of assumed dividend from the L.C.A.

£368,942
Less transfers—Sinking fund . . £21,500
Appropriation • ac. 47,442
68,942
£300,000
Perhaps some of it is quite as bad as the
directors —guided by various technical re-
ports—-allege it to be. Let it go at that.
If, for instance, the purchase of the L.C.A.
(Life Insurance Co. of Australia) was so
thoroughly unsound that £141,840 too much
was paid for it. the future will prove it.
If it wasn't so bad —well, if the amount is
written off now, any recoveries in the future
will simply swell the profits, as they have
done in the case of, say, the Q. N. Bank,
the Bank of N.Z.. and dozens of other con-
cerns which revalued themselves after the
smash of the boom of the ’nineties. And
from those recoveries, if any, the policy-
holders who stand by the co. will benefit.
Liabilities under A.P.A. policies at Decem-
ber 31. according to Actuary Doyle, were
£1,032,934. The co.’s funds (exclusive of
paid capital of £339,046) were:—
Life assurance fund .. . . .. £1,032,934
Special Reserve .. .. .. .. 150,000
Undistributed balance .. . . .. 583
£1,183,517
Less —
Purchase and establishment a< count .. 300,000
Net £883,517
Reserves are shown in the introductory table
as £895,695. Ordinarily the presence of re-
serves suggest that a co. has its capital intact
and so much over. Actually the A.P.A.
hasn't all its capital. The 1925 accounts
showed share capital intact for the first time.
But that is tarnished by the disclosures.
(The table just given excludes the £12,178
reserve for unexpired accident risks.) In-
deed, even more has gone, for a proportion
of the shares were issued at premiums—as
high as 100 p.c.—and of £165,438 raised that
way there is nothing left. The wonder is
that vastly more damage has not been done.
Actually, more business was written last
year, although the new writings were well
below 1924. Here is a three years’ com-
parison :
1924. 1925. 1920.

“Including divs.
Expenses in the Life Department at 32 p.c.
of income were lower, recent figures being:
35 p.c. in 1925 and 1924; 41 p.c. in ’23; 50
p.c. in ’22. Half of it would be a good
figure. As the promised “substantial econo-
mies’’ have yet to operate (the new board
took over in February last) the rate for
the current year should show a big cut. A
big. cut is very necessary. Assuming new
business to cost 10 times as much as old, the
rate last year was 168 p.c. compared with
the 172 p.c. for the previous year. When the
management succeeds m clipping off the odd
68 p.c., the figure will be satisfactory. The
rate of interest assumed is 4 p.c.—the older
offices work on a 31 p.c. or 3 p.c. basis—
which means, of course, that the fund need
not be so large as with more conservative
assumptions.
_ In the report it is recommended that
£30,000 p.a. be written off establishment
account and that “the balance of future profit
be used as a bonus to policy-holders.” But
it is also suggested that out of the savings
in administration—estimated at £16,000 —5
per cent. divs. should be paid. Talk of 5 p.c.
divs. at this stage, no matter how qualified,
is difficult to reconcile with the aim to re-
habilitate the co. as quickly as possible. It
is plain that each and every one of the
A.P.A. div. distributions was unjustified.
Past managements considered it necessary to
retain the goodwill of shareholders, and that
policy has been the cause of much of the
present trouble. To clean the accounts of
the rubbish and use the balance for bonuses
to policy-holders should be the immediate
aim; the interests of shareholders will bene-
fit, not suffer, if the insuring public is con-
vinced that its interests are given first place.
Here is the assets position as shown in
accounts of the past three years:—
1924. 1925. 1926.
Public securities .. £649,199 £639,473 £639,474
Properties .. .. 187,685 186,397 198,270
Mortgages .. .. 300,599 414,357 521,155

Cash 21,252 26,977 24,498
Other assets .. .. 16,136 13,056 16,302
The outlook is by no means hopeless. The
foundations are still solid enough. Policies
thus far are amply protected. But without
prospects of substantial bonuses, business,
even when got at great expense, will not stick.
The lapses are very serious. The future
depends upon the early settlement of the
contentions within the company. Shareholders
owe it to their policy-holders to end their
ridiculous quarrels.

The whole of the £lOO,OOO raised from the
new issue of ordinaries was in on April 30.
That par issue represented a fraction more
than one for every six shares—prof, and
ordinary—in the co., and was the second
£lOO,OOO which shareholders had the chance
of paying recently—the earlier lot went on
to the div. list as from the beginning of the
previous term. Capital is now £690,740 in
86.509 5 p.c. cum. prefs. and 004,231 ordin-
aries. What the co. earned from advance
payments (interest was allowed to April 30
at 0 p.c. p.a.) must have been negligible,
which indicates a nice increase in business,
for net profit was almost £2OOO greater than
tor the preceding year. The directors record
“a large increase in sales.” The wide margin
of profits in excess of dividends and the sus-
picion that very solid internal reserves exist
suggest that there will he little' difficulty in
maintaining the 10 p.c. divs. on. the increased
capital, notwithstanding the prospect of
heavier costs.
Balance-sheet movements show that the
co. has gone on adding to its strength:—

'The directors affirm that stocks ‘‘have been
valued at replacement cost or less, and pro-
vision made for any decline in market value”
—a necessary precaution, for the trend in
paper prices generally seems to be down-
ward. The slight increase in stock, coupled
with the intimated "large increase in sales.”
suggests that the co. isn’t letting things lie
on the shelves. Investments were £21,844
greater and the cash £77,183 compared with
£l2,9o4—the latter increase due, of course,
to the inflow of payments for the new
shares just prior to the. close of the accounts.
Most of the money will be sent in the same
direction as the last lot: increasing old ad-
vances or in new, but the directors report
that “the whole of that asset is adequately
protected by reserves against any possible
loss.”
Sundry creditors at April 30 were owed
£175,956. On the other hand cash, invest-
ments, sundry debtors and stocks aggregated
more than a million ; a strong position. The
86.509 prefs. were very firmly placed, net
tangibles being equal to £lO 16s. 2d. per
share. The management is in the hands of
men who have mostly graduated in the busi-
ness ; progress is steady; visible reserves are
mounting up; and it is eight since the
last gift issue. The market puts these facts
and factors in the balance and considers that
ords. are worth seeking at 335„ at which
price the 10 p.c. represents a return of a
shade over 6 p.c.

Gross figures were £4447 less than in the
previous year, and expenses were heavier;
between the two net profit was little more
than sufficient for the 8 p.c. div. The year
was rather dull, according to the directors,
but they consider prospects bright, and look
for better results from the current term.

Most of the recent growth appears to have
been financed by the co.'s bankers : last year
overdraft increased by £17,274. Trade
creditors were also heavier. Fixed assets
are of such hefty dimensions that adequate
allowance for depreciation is essential; pro-
ids claimed by the accounts are governed by
that factor. The provision is not shown.
Tin- co. s experience early in the current
century was not very agreeable and share-
holders were kept on short commons until
reserves were built up. Presumably that
lesson hasn’t been forgotten, though last
year's S p.e. distribution in the face of the
smaller profit and the heavier liabilities isn't
much of an exhibition of conservatism Of
paid capital of £300,000. £lOO,OOO consists
of 0 p.c. cum. profs.; these participate point
tor point with the ordinaries beyond that
rate. Net profits over the past five years
have averaged more than five times the
amount of their minimum div. And they
are well secured; net tangible assets, at
April 30, were equal to £4 2s. lid. per
prof, share. The co. operates on narrow
margins, and competition in the trade is
keen ; which suggests that, although history
shows that itis possible to strike fat years,
improvement is likely to be slow under nor-
mal conditions. The increase in expenditure,
s,i S ht ’ calls for close consideration;
liabilities are heavy; and in view of that
and of last year’s decrease in profit and
earner variations, the 8 p.c. can’t be looked
upon as very safe. In a case of this sort
it has to be remembered that dividends can
be paid only by increasing the borrowings;
and there is always liable to come a time
when the bank rather wants its lendings
reduced.

Towards the close of the year Castlemaine
Brewery of Fremantle was purchased, the
consideration being £29,095 in cash and
•>2,500 fully-paid (255.) Swan shares. As
Swan shares stand at about 60s. on the
market, the price represents something near
£136,000. Castlemaine’s last available
balance-sheet—to December 31, 1925—showed
net assets, including an unspecified amount
T „ goodwill, of £ls7.2o6—paid capital
£i 0,000; reserves, £87,206. The Swan not
only lias removed a competitor, but has
done so at what appears to be a very satis-
factory price. The co. isn’t standing still
at this milepost in its rather brilliant career
—it has a past, but that is long since for-
gotten. Negotiations are said to be com-
plete for taking over the Emu Brewery, of
Perth, for £lOO.OOO, to be paid for in Swan
shares. And an issue of 22.500 new ordin-
aries at a premium of 10s. is also announced.
Needless to say, the issue will be rushed,
for even with the premium the 16 p.c. div.
is worth almost 11,} p.c. Apart from the
sweet divs., there are the possibilities. It
is a long time since the last bonus issue, and
the co. is in a position to do the handsome
thing by shareholders whenever it so desires.
The March half includes the thirsty
months. Amalgamating the figures for the
two half-years it will be seen that average
progress lias been maintained and the dis-
closed figures are doubtless a cautious esti-
mate of what the board Ihiiiks was the net
result. Of course, brewing cos. have to
provide for contingencies on a much more
lavish scale than once was necessary. At
the same time, one nasty corner, so far as
the Swan is concerned, has been just about
turned. At one time it was feared that
when Westralia’s goldmining industry petered
out the country’s economy would be very
seriously disturbed. Fortunately, however,
the State’s farming has made quite unex-
pected progress and from all appearances
will continue to do so.
Balance-sheet figures moved in response
to the Castlemaine purchase. Liabilities, as
usual, were very moderate for a concern of
tliis kind. Mortgages increased a trifle;
the amount owing on open accounts was
£13,830 heavier at £38.172 and “accounts

the plant—they are in at £638,457, but, of
course, that is merely a book value. Still
there are a lot of odds and ends of plant; and
though the net loss on mining and treatment
for the year was £137.306, a few thousands

Meantime the co.'s troubles are being added
<o. Some time ago the “Wild Cat” men-
tioned that the fire in the pyrites on the
Linda level was still burning. Fumes have
since given a lot of trouble, and have re-
sulted in temporary stoppages. Now the
reverb, furnace has collapsed, and smelting
will be hung up for a month or more.
The position of Barrier stocks claims at-
tention, in view of the steady decline in
metal prices, especially lead, which has
slipped steadily down the scale from £35 a
ton to £22 17s. Gd. in the last few months.
North Broken Ilill shares have dropped in
sympathy from round about £7 to seller £5.
and even this market is being maintained
only by holders of heavy parcels who
don't want to start a slide. Lead production
costs on the Barrier were said to be near
£22 a ton some months ago. With the mar-
ket at £22 17s. Gd., the margin on the costs
basis mentioned would be mighty small. The
co. is responding as it can—the June output
shows a marked increase at all points on
those of April and May. But the possi-
bilities in that direction are comparatively
small.
In 1926 only two' Vic. gold-mining cos.
paid divs. —the Rose, Shamrock and Thistle,
of llarrietville, £1000; and Hercules and
Energetic, Bendigo, £l5OO. The whole State’s
yield was only 49,0780 z., of which Hercules
produced 63920 z. Black coal raised amounted
to 591,000 tons valued at £657,798, and
brown coal 734,000 tons worth £110,600.
The quantities of brown coal mined will
gradually increase, because the Altona mine
near Newport will re-open next month for
the production of brown coal for the manu-
facture of briquettes, and for the extraction
of oil. At Morwell an English co. will
shortly open a big deposit right in the town-
ship which was bored many years ago to
1000 feet, disclosing three seams aggregating
811 feet in thickness. The bore left off in
brown coal. This co. will also make
briquettes and distil oil by a new English
process, the L. and N.
Electrolytic Zinc believes in travel for its
technical stufF. W. (’. Snow, chief metal-
lurgist, is to be one of the eight Australian
delegates to the second Triennial Conference
of the Empire mining and metallurgical
conference, which will be opened in Mont-
real on August 22. Seven hundred dele-
gates will attend, and after the formal
opening two parties will set out on mine-
inspection tours, etc., one west, the other
north-east. The western tour will be by
special trains in which the party will live •
as well as travel, as guests of Canada. Snow,
who is the last left of the American experts
brought over from the TJ.S.A. in 1916 by
H. W. Gepp, will return via England and
Germany.

“Peter": Notwithstanding the death of
George Brookman, the mining fever is not
likely to leave the Brookman-Sam Pearce
clan so long as any one of the three sons of
the latter is able to pound a dolly pot.
Hubert, Reg. and Arthur Pearce all tried
Alaska and Canada with some success, and
Hubert’s return to W.A. recently brought
about the opening-up of the Waratah lease
at Corboy’s Find—the show is responding
very well to development. At present it is
under option to the Mutooroo Co., and, while
it does not promise to become a Great Boul-
der, it is on the cards that it will develop
into. a payable concern. If there is to be
a mining revival in W.A., men like Hubert
Pearce are more likely than the politicians
to bring it about.

Westralian mine-buyers are watching a
new gold find near Wiluna. One claim has
been optioned on London account, and a
moneyed Adelaide syndicate has sent Best-
wick to investigate matters and act generally
in its interests. Already prospects are said
to be favorable enough to get the public in
and start a flutter.
* * * *
Wiluna (W.A.) still pleases its admirers
with reports of big widths of payable ore.
Main workings are down only about 300 ft.,
yet already there are the makings of a very
big mine in sight. The co. is testing oil
flotation and dry crushing before finally de-
ciding which method of treatment to adopt.
But whichever process is decided on the direc-
tors are confident of earning big money.

Westralia’s coal output has now topped
the half-million tons p.a. Collie produces the
lot. Every mine there except one or two is
controlled by Amalgamated Collieries, Ltd.,

shares. Amalgamated is paying good divs.
and building up strong reserves.

Guinea Gold is to issue its other 10,334

will be offered the new issue, one for every
two. at a premium of £l. Shares carry the
right to participate in share issues of the
three Guinea Gold pups, North, South and
Central, which hold IS miles of leases in
the lower Bulolo. As the “Wild Cat"
announced on June 10 an option over the
North has been taken up by the J. V. R.
Miles group of investors in Malayan tin
interests, and Tom Horton has been sent
up to sample. The other leases, hitherto
practically untouched, are being tested by
Guinea Gold’s staff, which has suspended
operations on its own job meanwhile.

Thabawleik Tin, an Austral-Malay subsi-
diary. which was the first Australian co. to
invade South Burma, started heavily in debt
to its parent, the issued capital (£160,000)
proving insufficient to meet the unexpectedly
heavy outlay on dredge and mine equipment.
There have been other handicaps, such as
water shortages, but the very high boring
value of the area points to ultimate success.
Boring was conducted by Austral Malay's
staff, and showed 16,400,000 cubic yards
averaging 1.461 b. tin oxide per c.y., and
1,800.000 yards worth .621 b. Further bor-
ing of the ground ahead of the dredge for the
next six months showed 21b. of oxide to the
yard. Nevertheless, Thabawleik has not taken
the place expected of it. During the six
months to June 30 the dredge averaged 50,000
c.y. for 1.521 b. per yard, being 90 p.c. of bore
values and the total output 200 tons. The
June return is given as 32 tons. Thabaw-
leik will have to get nearer the prospectus
estimate of 60 tons if it is to climb to the
dividend list quickly and stay there. The
June average of 60,000 yards is good enough.
But there is £24,000 to pay off. The co.
hopes to put through a monthly 75,000yd5.,
with a bore value of 21b. per yard, during the
dredge’s next six months. The dredge, a bit
old-fashioned, is fitted with sluice-boxes only,
and digs to only 25 feet below water level;
but as the average depth is only 164 feet,
that doesn’t matter. What does matter is
that it is supposed to have a monthly capa-
city of 100,000 c.y., and thus far hasn't done
anything near it. Until things improve in
this respect the official estimate of dividends
in October will be in doubt.
❖ s|: *
Malayan tin dredging returns for June
are encouraging. Kampong Kamunting, Aus-
tral Malay’s “star” show, took 81 tons of
oxide from 145,000 yards, well above the
co.’s original boring value of 1.211 b. to the
yard. Asam Kumbang, another Austral
Malay subsidiary, nearly doubled its May
output with 62 tons from 86,000 yards—
roughly lflb. per c.y.—confirmation of the
forecast that the dredge would soon be in
richer ground. Ulu Yam, with 43 tons from
104,000yd5., is over its estimated average of
,761 b., while Thabawleik’s drop to 32 tons
from the May output of 43j tons is charac-
teristic of this tricky dredging proposition.
It is a good show, but shares are dear at
6ls. Larut’s four dredges accounted for 107
toils, as against 106 in May, total tonnage
being 344,000. Tin Bentong maintained its
average with 36| tons. Ronpibon’s turnover
was small; 21 days were lost in repairs,
installations, etc. Ronpibon must about
hold the record for stoppages of this kind.
Kuala Kampar’s 175,000 c.y. for 30 tons
is much below the requirement of 50 tons
per month, and the average is well under
the prospectus estimate of ,661 b.
Malim Nawar South, with 45 tons, was
15 tons lower than May: hours worked and
yardage do not differ sufficiently to account
for the drop. Malim Nawar’s output im-
proved 25 tons, as against 15. It has still
a lot of climbing to do to reach the pro-
spectus estimates. Ivundang had another
bad month; matters need to improve here.
Itawang’s drop from 35 to 30 tons indicates
that the bucket dredge has cut out of the
good patch. The sluicing plant also has fallen
off. putting through only 35 tons as against
45 in May.
It is interesting to note the varying Mal-
ayan yardage costs. The big Larut com-
bination has cut them down to 4.64 d. per
c.y. Thabawleik’s is IO.Sd. Ulu Yam, under
the same control as Thabawleik. gets its
stuff out at sd. per c.y. Nawng Pet, one of
the Malay-Siamese group, shows Is. 2d. per
yard. But the Pet is a sluicing show, and
one with old-fashioned equipment. Generally
speaking, costs tend to become higher every
year, and this is a point worth watching, not
only by punters but by investors in estab-
lished concerns.

The disposal of Klong Rah, an Austral
Malay option in the Pungah Valley, has been
a problem for some time past. Tt was placed
under option to Ivamunting, one of Austral
Malay’s subsidiaries, and has now been taken
over as an addition to another area which
Ivamunting has bored and found payable.
The co. is to be the Pungah River Tin Con-
cessions, capital £300.000 in £1 shares. The
combined areas contain 36 million yards, of
wheli 23 million yards is said to be pound
ground, and the balance .64 lb. There are
to be two electrically-driven dredges, each
140,000 tons per month. Austral Malay's
price for passing over Klong Rah was
£35,000. Payment will be made with 17,500
f.p. shares in Pungah River Tin Conces-
sions, and £17.500 cash.

Sydney Siam, a holding co., has been in-
vestigating areas under prospecting license
in Western Siam. The co. has also been
suspected of taking an interest in the Edie
Creek (New Guinea) goldfield. It has lately
taken two “additional options” in Western
Siam, each of 1250 acres. These options are
probably identical with the co.’s prospecting
area of 2400 acres at Bangkah, near Renong.
This was scout-bored some time ago by Reid
and Bethune, the co.’s engineers, who re-
ported that 290 acres indicated an average
valujj of 13oz. with an average depth of 35
feet. Check-boring by “an independent ex-
pert” was to follow. The last report, though
short, and vague, states that boring on the
options referred to -in it has shown 16oz.
over 1250 acres, to a depth of 40 feet. But
the directors are not very explicit about their
activities —which rather puzzles the market.

Bundi’s new dredge in the Cheney Valley
has not yet got to work, though it has been
given a trial run ; it has been delayed for jig-
adjustment. It is a Werf Conrad plant,
guaranteed to dig 144,000 cubic yards a
month, and shareholders are hoping that
when i£ gets to work divs. will be resumed.
The old dredge in the adjoining Bundi Valley
has been working since the end of 1924, but
though the tin content of the ground is high,
clay and buried timber have impeded work
and increased costs. For the year ended
December, 1925. Bundi Valley put through
688,000 c.y. of 1.0651 b. ground, working costs
being a little over For 1926 the total
was 650,000 yards and the average just over
11b. The return for June shows a recovery
of only 2] tons from 67,000 yards, which
suggests that values are weakening or the
old-style 70,000-ton dredge is not getting full
recoveries. The new plant, with its jigs and
classifiers, should cause a marked improve-
ment in returns.
Lampeh Tin has had its vicissitudes since
the co. was registered in Melbourne in 1922.
Paid capital is £127,500 in 100,000 ords. f.-p.
and 50,000 10 p.c. cum. prefs. (paid to 11s.)
participating equally with ords. The small
bucket dredge has a capacity of 42,000 c.y.
per month, digging to 30ft. The first dredge,
a suction cutter, proved unpayable. The
co.’s original area included 428 acres under-
lease and 4370 acres under prospecting
license. On the lease 300 acres were bored,
and showed lib. to the yard. Latest reports
state that 31 scout bores have been put down
on “Block D” of the second area, aver-
aging 21.7 feet in depth, 15oz. to the yard.
Limestone pinnacles have been Lampeh’s
chief stumbling-block to date, and the direc-
tors have considered the question of dealing
with a large proportion of their property by
hydraulic sluicing. It seems doubtful
whether the small dredge now being built
cau pay.
“Prospector ’: Re alluvial gold deposition.
I suspect “Wynbye” (B. 23/6/'27) of having
replied to me trom the comfortable depths
of an armchair. One can’t deny that there
is evidence of deposition of gold from sur-
faco waters, but its influence in forming
true alluvial is so small that I could be for-
given for not mentioning it. It is far more
important in what might be termed bedded
deposits, including that little deposit known
as the Hand “banket." But we can’t call
that alluvial any more than we can call the
Nullagine conglomerates alluvial. “Wynbye”
is mixing boulder beds and river gravels pro-
miscuously as alluvials. Occasionally allu-
vial deposits may be enriched by chemical
precipitation, but features of this type are
absence of slugs or nuggets and presence of
“paint" gold. It is news to me that the
famous Palmer (N.Q.) owed its gold to this
source. A case he could have cited in Queens-
land is file Black Ridge lead, near Blair
Athol (Q.), where gold occurs in “fish"
(a local name for a boulder clay carrying
gold), which occurs interbedded with coal
beds. It is called alluvial by the miners,
but geologists consider the gold was depo-
sited from solution.

“Small Subscriber” :
I am with “Large Subscriber” (B. 30/6/’27) in
desiring information from the Marshall-Longton-
Lucknovv group. I agree with him as to the un-
satisfactory manner—to put it mildly—in which
these shows are. run. How is it that I, as a shareholder,
have never had a notice of a meeting or a balance-
sheet? I thought these things were obligatory.
The only information I have received is a notice of
a call. Various promises were made to induce
people to put their money into these mines, and
so far as I know not one single one has ever
been kept. If we cannot get! the riches promised, at
least we are entitled to information.

Grandmaster Snowball, the new Speaker
of Yic. Assembly (he was elected without
opposition), is the fourth lawyer to hold
the job. Matthew Davies (1887-’92), Frank
Madden (1904-’l7) and John Emanuel
Mackey (1917-'24) were the other three.
Until placed in the chair Snowball had had
no pickings in the 18 years since ho succeeded
Tommy Bent as member for Brighton. He
has served as Chairman of the Outports
Royal Commission and of the Elections and
Qualifications Committee, but they were hon-
orary posts.
Yic. Speaker’s chair had hardly been
warmed by O. R. Snowball when he called
out “Order, brethren.” This reminder that
he was accustomed to preside over the Grand
Lodge of the Tangerines caused a general
grin, and many a “How-do-you-like-that?”
look was cast at Premier Hogan.
A section of Sydney's lovely Municipal
Labor party is jibbing at the appointment of
cricketer J. M. Taylor as controller of the
Council’s dental clinic at £7OO p.a. Perhaps
one of Johnny’s offences is the possession of
a Digger’s badge. He is the son of the Rev.
AY. G. Taylor, who used to draw crowds of
admirers of his eloquence to the Centenary
Hall in York-street. The young man learnt
cricket and other accomplishments at New-
ington College.
David Hastie Harvey, general manager
and organiser of Tatt’s., was accompanied to
his graveside the other day by the Rev. A.
Gamble.
F. S. N. Bousfield, who gives up charge
of Brisbane Grammar School at the end of
this year, is the third headmaster the school
has had in its GO years or so of existence.
It is close on 40 years since he joined the
staff, and for half that term he has been
head. A product of Winchester and Oxford,
Bousfield is one of the most notable classical
scholars in Australia, and his fine person-
ality has earned him the affection of thou-
sands of Queenslanders who have passed
through his hands. He was one of Queens-
land’s early golf addicts, and has been known
to indulge in pig-sticking in Western Queens-
land, but that was a long time ago.
Rev. Septimus Hungerford, whose death
was noted last week, was the last Australian
clergyman to receive a State stipend. The
last R.C. recipient was Archpriest Patrick
Sheeliy, who died about 15 years ago; he
was one of the original Benedictine Fathers
attached to old St. Mary’s Cathedral by
Archbishop Folding. When the Benedictine
Order here was disbanded Sheeliy carried on
as a secular priest under Cardinal Moran.
Perth has lost a kindly soul in Timothy
Francis Quinlan, who came from Tipperary
as an infant. Though only GG, he belonged
to a past era in Groperland politics. He
sat for a metropolitan constituency from
’9l to ’97 and subsequently represented Tood-
yay for 14 years. He had a taste of Minis-
terial office in the Morgan Ministry of ’Ol.
which lasted only a few weeks, but he was
Speaker for the last half-dozen years of his
Parliamentary career. His extensive landed
and commercial interests took up most of
his time in later years. A son sleeps in
France—he fell when Ludendorff was trying
to reach the Channel ports in 1918.
The four honoraries in the Hogan Labor
team (Vic.) and the whip are allowed £2OO
each, made up by their eight salaried col-
leagues. This reduces Hogan’s screw from
£1551 to £1326 and the other seven from
£1207 to £lOB2 each. A percentage has also
to be paid to party funds. Prior to 1895 Vic.
Ministei’s had more money to play with, as
the appropriation for the 10 salaried men
was £15.500. In those times the Premier
drew £2OOO a year.
Carlos Haner Simmonds, Consul in Aus-
tralia for his South American birthplace,
Columbia, for nearly 40 years, has laid aside
the job by order of the Reaper. After a
brief commercial career in New York Sim-
monds came to Sydney half a century ago
and set up in the insurance business. Almost
at once he became the right-hand man of
Archbishop Vaughan in handling R.C. chari-
ties ; for most of the time he was treasurer
of the Westmead Boys’ Orphanage. Blind-
ness clouded the last days of a life that
ended at 78.
Premier Joe Lyons, of the Speck, gets poli-
tics at home as well as outside. Both his
wife and his mother-in-law have attempted to
get into the Tasmanian Assembly. Years
ago as a young pupil-teacher in Tassy, Lyons
read a pamphlet by Tom Tunnecliffe, now
Vic. Railways Minister, and he dates his
interest in politics from that moment.
W. 11. Everard, the breezy Lib. member for
Evelyn, could have bagged the Vic. Speaker-
ship if he hadn’t been pledged to Snowball.
He is a son of John Everard, a member of
Vie. Parliament for 20 years. After matricu-
lating from Scotch Col., Melbourne, the
son did pretty well out of tea, and probably
would have done better if he hadn’t devoted
so much time to politics and the nursing of
an electorate.
Tom Bowling, of New England (N.S.W.),
who bred the champion Corriedale ram that
brought the record price of 175 guineas for
this type of sheep at the recent Sydney sale,
came to Australia as a young Englishman in
search of colonial experience 30-odd years
ago. Most of his sheep lore was acquired
as a jackeroo on the Australian Pastoral
Co.’s holdings in S.-W. Queensland. The
Corriedale is a Maoriland product —a meat-
wool cross—and it is a feather in the cap
of an Australian tlockmaster to have repro-
duced the creature so successfully.
William McPherson, who missed the \ ic.
Premiership in May because he could not
succeed in unifying the non-Labor majority
ARCHBISHOP
SPENCE ( R.C.),
Adelaide.
in Vic. Assembly,
was keen on secur-
ing tin' Opposition
leadership, and suc-
ceeded last week.
Allan’s Country
Party of 10 would
not take part in the
meeting, and the
Nationalists elected
1 the leader of the
Left. The allow-
ance of £2OO a year
is nothing to Mc-
Pherson. but the
status of the job, a
special room at Par-
liament House (he
does not mix well
with fellow-mem-
bers) and the pro-
vision of a private
secretary to do the
devilling for him
will be appreciated.
With only McPher-
son, Peacock,
Argyle and Jimmy
McDonald on it, the
front Opposition
bench looked empty
on the day the ses-
sion opened.
The oldest of the old boys at Geelong
Grammar School’s reunion the other day
was Jimmy Trangmar, of Coleraine (Vic.).
He was born at Portland in 1850, and went
to the school in 18G7. His father, Major
James Trangmar, crossed to the mainland
from Van Diemen’s Land with the Hentys
in the ’thirties of last century.
Former N.S.W. Chief Kailway Commis-
sioner Johnson, now re-visiting this country,
was unpopular in the service because of bis
abrupt manner. Once when on tour he con-
sented to give an interview to an aggrieved
night-officer. Taking his watch off its chain
and laying it open before him as the man
with the grievance entered, he said, “I’ll give
you five minutes to say what you have to
say.” “I couldn’t say in five minutes what
I would like to say about you, sir,” was
the unexpected retort. The officer was fired
for insubordination, but now stands high in
the Queensland Railway service.
Queensland’s new Governor isn’t the first
John Goodwin that Brisbane has known.
When Ryan established the State Insurance
Office in 1936 he selected a man of that name,
now dead, as first commissioner, and never
regretted it. When Goodwin resigned after
three years he was so popular with his staff
and others that a bob-in subscription
brought in £5O.
Harry Allan, who will complete his 65th
year in a few weeks, will soon relinquish his
job as Under Sec. of Vic. Lands Department.
He had a stiff climb to the second-top rung,
and impaired his health when he was land
immigration officer, working with insufficient
staff. Allan helped to re-discover Mt. Dan-
denong as a tourist resort, and built himself
a shack there. His late brother Frank, “the
bowler of a century,” used to,be in command
of the rabbit destruction branch of the Lands.
Next time H. R. Lee dashes about show-
ing his bare knees it will be as Assistant
Commissioner of N.S.W. Bo.v Scouts, after
a mere five years of shepherding Wolf Cubs
and the like. He is well known on the
South Coast, being industrial officer to the
Port Kembla co. and industrial officer and
secretary to the State branch of the Aus-
tralian Mines and Metals Association.
Grateful folk in the Riverina are getting
up a testimonial for Sam Barnes, Vic.
Minister of Railways and Mines for five
years after the Armistice, who lately lost
the Walhalla seat. Sam was mainly respon-
sible for extending Vic.’s sft. 3in. gauge
lines into the Riverina. Last session when
the Nationalists and Cockies were strain-
ing at the leash Barnes was suggested as a
stopgap Premier. His challenge to people
who claimed to have discovered oil in differ-
ent parts of Victoria to show him a thimble-
ful of genuine liquid has become a tradi-
tion in the Mines Department.
Vic. Treasury’s cut out of Sunshine Har-
vester McKay’s estate of £1,400,000-odd was
£211,000. The Federal Treasury’s share has
yet to be collected.
“The Deacon’’: Though Father Torn Kelsh,
who recently celebrated his diamond jubilee
(B. 30/0/’27), is the oldest-born Australian
priest, he has not the longest service in the
Apple Isle. Archdeacon Beechinor, who,
though nearly 90, is in robust health and
carries on single-handed—Kelsh is an invalid
now—has been officiating without a break for
G 4 years. He is the oldest product of the
Propaganda College of Koine in this part of
the globe.
Not all the iron-jawed brigade are in
Parliament. The other Sunday afternoon
Steve Bradley, president of Melb. unem-
ployed, spoke from one till six without stop-
ping to wet h*s whistle or to take a really
long breath. On no point did he repeat
himself more than 15 times, and a reporter
who found Pitman powerless before the flood
estimated that in the most impassioned pas-
sages the gait was GOO words to the minute.
J. S. Wasley, who has been appointed lo
Vic. Supreme Court for six months in place
of Macfarlan, J., who is on leave, hails from
the Ballarat district. He is quick and accu-
rate, and will pull his full weight, as lie has
shown on the County Court Bench. The
appointment will mean another £5OO in his
pocket for the half-year.
“Mem. Stock Ex.”: I remember the diffi-
culty George Brookman, lately gone west in
Adelaide, went through when floating the Cool-
gardie Prospecting Association, which took
over from him leases covering most of the
Golden Mile at Kalgoorlie. It was not until
Harvey Patterson, the Broken Hill director,
bought 10 shares at £lO apiece that the list
was filled in Melbourne. Five of us, all
attached to the Broken Ilill group at that
time, took one or two shares each, and
promptly sold them—at a small profit—-on
adverse reports from the field. I shall always
regard the sale of my shares as the worst
five minutes’ work of my hectic life.
Nicholas Mcßurney, an old friend of Henry
Parkes, has gone the way of the whiskered
political leader at whose meetings he so often
acted as chairman. Kirribilli Point was a
scattered village of a few cottages with a
backing of bushland when Mcßurney went
to live there 50 years ago, being then 32;
and he became a sort of father of politics
on the North Shore. He was the leading
speaker in a deputation which asked that
a public school should be established at
Milson’s Point. Wool was his business.
David Davis, the Sydney master builder,
who finished with plans last week, was a
present from Norfolk Island, where he was
born 73 years ago—two years before the
Pitcairn Islanders were brought there and a
year before the island was handed back to
N.S.W. His parents took him to Victoria
when a boy. but he went to N.S.W. when he
grew up. Sydney’s Public Library, Govern-
ment Printing Office and Macquarie Light-
house are amongst the buildings he erected.
MR. SPEAKER SNOWBALL, of Vic,
elected to the Chair last week.
Bishop Armstrong, of Wangaratta (Vic.),
believed to be the tallest cleric sporting
gaiters—he is Gft. 3in. —is hanging up the
crozier after 25 years’ service in N.-E. Vic.
He went to a small congregation in a bush
church, and leaves a cathedral and a regular
army of worshippers. Wangaratta High
School owes a lot to him, and he’s a good
sport.
THE GOD IN THE CAR.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
“Within a few days after the announcement of
the basic wage, the N.S.W. Government intimated
that it had purchased a £750 motor-car for the use
of the Industrial Commissioner (Mr. Piddington).
The Commissioner has had to do quite a lot of
travelling to discover the ways and means resorted
to by the workers of making ends meet..’’ — Age’s
Sydney correspondent.

A god in the machine

Proconsul, did you say?
Judge, statesman, savant? Nay,

No monarch, I’ll engage.

He nods with import sage;
Up goes the basic wage
A peg, amid o-

And ’twould as quick go down,

And he, whose honest gaze

WEANING FOALS.
[Fok The Bulletin.]
There's a sound goes up in the lonely night
That pierces the skies in vain,
The aching cry of a love bereft.
In the cold, and the wind, and the rain.
Oh, it throbs through the pulsing' darkness.
It wings to the misty sky,
For the great brood mares are calling
And the weaning foals reply.
They are down in the old home paddock,
It is huge and long and wide;
They have crowded close to the hearer fence,
And are huddled side by side.
Arid the grey niglit-sliades are falling,
And gathering, crowding nigh,
And the mares to their foals are calling
And the youngling foals reply.
1 >h, the dark shades close around them,
And the rising wind is chill,
And nought reck they of the shelter-belt
On the further side of the hill.
So they close up tight in the misty night
With a piteous yearning cry,
For the great brood mares are calling
And the lonely foals reply.
Old earth, thou hast much of sorrow;
Old earth, thou hast much of pain;
There are mournful sounds in the lonely night
That ring through the dark in vain.
But of all sad sounds, the saddest
Is that piercing, anguishing cry
When the great brood mares are calling
And the weaning foals reply.

“Up North”: The Torres Islanders are
observant students of the stars. The appear-
ance, re-appearance or non-appearance of
different constellations marks the time of
liarvesting, planting and fishing. Their most
esteemed star is “Kek,” which is in glory
about the end of the nor’-west season. Kek
sends the rains, and fattens the dugong and

turtle, and marks the time when the new
crop of yams may be dug. Many ceremonies
used to be held in Ivek’s honor. Especially
were there torchlight processions of sinewy
warriors and plump damsels clad in flowers
and chastity, who entreated Kek in song to
send renewed youth to man and maid, yam
and turtle, banana and fish, and to weaken
the hearts of the fat dugongs so that they
would fall easy victims to the wawp and coir.
“Teamster” : Tell “Sea Bream” (B.
10/6/27) that his spotted shark is a carpet-
shark or wobbegong. It is a common enough
variety and likes rough water, being often
caught in the surf. Its skin is valuable to
Aselt alone.

“Wang”: “Narrow escapes?” said Bill.
"M ell, 1 once ’sperienced th’ narrowest one
ot any of yez. I was humpin’ Matilda up
through nor’-east Vic., ah’ one
night, when it was rainin’ cats
an’ dorgs, I camps on tli’ banks
of tli’ Ovens. I puts up me
tent under a big redgum what’s
leanin’ across tli’ river on th’
edge of a steep bank. Durin’ th’
night I ’ears a ’ell of a crash,
an’ feels somethin’ rippin’ th’
ground underneath me, an’ up
1 goes inter th’ air, carryin’ th’
tent with me. About twenty
feet up I stops. I dunno what’s
gawn wrong, an’ I can’t see
nothin’ 'count of ’avin’ th’ tent
’angin’ around me like a
statelier what’s waitin’ t’ be un-
veiled. After a while I manages
t’ drag th’ tent orf me an’ ’avo
a screw. Struth! I near
fainted. All round me is water,
an’ I’m movin’ along on th’ top
of it, with me feet about a
coupler feet clear. Sheep an’
’orses an’ cows is floatin’ all
around me, some of ’em alive
goin’ like paddle-steamers.
Tli’ tree I’d been camped
under ’ad fallen into th’ river
wen th’ flood come rushin’
down, an’ one of th’ roots ’ad
broke off just under where I
was lyin’, catchin’ me trousis
belt at th’ back an’ liftin’ me
right up. Well, I floats along
all right till daylight come ;
then I spots a big draught-
orse swimmin’ along just: under-
neath me. I gets me knife out,
saws through me belt an’ drops
fair on to ’is back. After a bit
I works ’im terwards a slopin’
bank, an’ we- scrambles on t’
dry land. Gripes, it teas a
narrer escape! An’ th’ funny
thing was I did well out of it.
Th’ ’orse belonged to a squat-
ter what lived thereabouts an’
lie gives me a fiver fer rescuin’ it.”
“Coola”: An interesting species of ants
has its home in Centralia. The members
of the family are small and brown, with
bright yellow legs.
They live among
the porcupine grass
tussocks, and build
curious little round
towers about tli e
stems. To th e
nearest shrub or
tree they construct
overground covered
ways half-round in
shape and not un-
like worms in ap-
pearance. Grains
of sand are used in
the work; these ap-
pear to be glued
together by some
sticky stuff exuded
from the little scale
insects with which
the ants co-operate
in a sort of part-
nership. Some of
these scale insects
live on the grass
stems and others on
the leaves of shrubs.
Larger ants called
“li o n e y - pot s,”
sugar-ants and
others also take
great interest in
these insects. As
soon as the sun
sinks low, the yel-
low shanks come
from their tunnels
and travel in leis-
urely fashion along
cleared tracks and
up the trees where
the scales await
them. Returning
late at nig h t,
gorged with spoil,
they discharge the
nectar into th e
mouths of slave
brethren who dwell in the cool home cellars,
and whose elastic abdomens serve as barrels.
* * ❖ Hi
“Black Tracker” : A S.A. pastoralist who
has taken up a big area of country in the
mining district of Mount Leonora (W.A.)
found on his run the remains of two con-
densing plants which drew their supplies of
salt water from deep wells. Hundreds of
travellers in the early days paid 3d. per gal-
lon for the condensed product and came from
far and wide for it. To day within half a
mile of these wells an unlimited supply of
fresh water can be found ac a shallow depth.
Some idea of the increase in land values on
goldfields once thought useless for other than
mining purposes is given by the fact that this
man refused an offer that would have netted
him £20.000 on his outlay.
HE lIAD TO WAIT FOR THE VERDICT.
PRESIDING J.P. (to witness of assault case): “’Ere, ’ow is it you didn’t go to the
assistance of the plaintiff?”
JACKY: “Cripes, boss, I dunno which phella, going to be praintiff till the fight finish.”
“W.J.T.”: The natives of Dobu, South
Eastern Papua, also have a novel method of
fishing with spider-web (B. 2/6/’27). They
fly a kite, from the stern of a canoe, attached
to the tail of the flier being a bait of glu-
tinous spider-web. So skilful are their
users that the webs skim along the surface
of the water like flies. I have seen garfish
strike at a web and their teeth become
entangled in it. The canoe is paddled up
and the fish taken without lowering the kite.
* * *
“O.II.”: The stingaree is the wild dog
of the worried oyster-lease man. The water-
scape at Mallacoota (Vic. 1 is disfigured by
adaptations of the dog-proof fence. Oyster
beds are enclosed by palisades of vertical
stakes driven firmly into the sea-bottom at
intervals of a couple of inches, and project-
ing well above high-water level. There is
very little tide. The oysters are grazed
on the submerged banks, and if not protected
as described, the stingaree chews up large
numbers of the immature steak-garnishers
in his tough and leathery mouth. The stock-
ade method of defence cramps the enemy’s
style, and secures for the youthful oyster
a fair start in life.
* * *
“Max”: It seems incredible that there
can be only five specimens of “G.B.L.’s”
kurrajong (B. 9/6/’27). Why not send a
leaf and a description of the plant and
its flowers to the Technological Museum,
Sydney, for identification? If, however, it
is the tree I think it to be, no flowers will
be available at this time of the year. I
did not mean a “flame tree” when I replied
to “G.B.L.’s” first par., for that is a loose
term my training in botany abhors. Almost
every country on earth boasts a “flame tree”
of some sort or another, the name being
used to describe any tree which produces
bright red flowers or leaves. In N. S. Wales
it is applied indiscriminately to various
sorts of Erytfirina (coral-trees), to Brachy-
chiton acerifolius, and to Sierculia aceri-
folia. Correct botanical nomenclature is
fixed, and is the only safe way of describ-
ing plants.
*s* v v
“Werrimee”: Let me tell “Mapee” (B.
16/(i./'27) that I have worked in the big
cedar scrubs and the heavy forests of the
Richmond and Clarence Rivers when big
stuff w r as plentiful, also in the Burnett
(blackbutt) country, and I have never
known an axeman to use a handle with the
factory-made knob left on it. As “R.lv.”
points out, when sawing the knob off a
small portion of the heel is left, which is
all that is necessary to prevent a loosely-
held handle from slipping through the hand.
But an expert axeman doesn't let it slip
through his hands if there is no heel on it.
Cutting the knob off doesn’t shorten the
reach. As it conies from the factory it
resembles a horse’s hoof that needs cutting,
and the tapered bulge would blister the
hand of Horny Ned. As to using the full
length of the handle, how else would he
use it. to get the full force of a blow, whether
chopping a tree down or chopping a log?
* * * *
“Sea Nomad”: Has any wanderer dropped
across the Goldie Reefs? They are charted
as just off the Fortlocks, on the Eastern
Fields, roughly 120 miles west of Port
Moresby, but I’ve never met a sailorman
who’s seen them, though many luggers have
searched for them as a likely fishing ground
for troclius. Murray Island is about 90
miles west; the Eastern Fields themselves
lie roughly between the New Guinea coast
and the mainland. All the waters in between
have been cruised over for years by the shell-
ing fleets. Yet I’ve never heard of the
Goldie Reefs haying been actually located.
“Moe"; Along some parts of the coast
of Dutch New Guinea there is a curious
custom which requires a woman who has
become a widow to smear herself with white
clay.. For a certain period after the hus-
band's death, she is not spoken to by any of
the other inhabitants of the village. Her
food is placed separate, and she sleeps in
a hut. by herself. When the period of com-
plete isolation is up, the clay is washed off.
but she has still to go through a further
course of semi-exclusion before being able
to take her full place in the Adllage and again
become eligible for marriage.
“Yufu”: Dog-mothers are not always as
sensible as “Eureka’s” slut (B. 19/5/’27).
Our milk-o has a fox-terrier that gave birth
to a litter of six. After a few days foxy
took a liking to a bed on the back verandah
and dumped her family there. Hunted from
this sunny position, she carried her puppies
one by one into the feed-shed. Several hours
later, one of the men, entering the shed, found
chaff everywhere and the mother caressing
her dead litter. She had picked on the
bin of chaff for their bed, and of course the
little snugglers had sunk down into the
bodiless stuff and been smothered. Foxy
had dug them out again. She insisted oil
digging them out of the ground, also, after
they were buried, and made such a nuisance
of herself carting her dead puppies about
that in the end they had to be cremated.

POWER —The soft purr of the Packard motor hardly
hints its vast reserve power. Yet a touch of the
accelerator and the great car leaps forward with the
eagerness of a living thing. Mile after mile through
the starts and stops of the city traffic, hour after
hour on the long pull of the mountain grade, the
Packard proves superior to all requirements —
Packard power now reigns supreme.
Packard design—widely imitated but never equalled—has long
been recognised as an outstanding combination of smartness,
beauty and comfort. And now to the man who desires to own a
really fine car at a moderate outlay we commend the distinction
and power of the Packard at the new prices listed on this page.

“Carisbrook, Jun.” : During a six months’
sojourn on Willis Island (N.Q.), where
there are countless thousands of seabirds, I
never saw oue sleep soundly on the water
(B. 2/6/’27). In fact, with the exception
of gulls, they appeared to detest their natu-
ral clement. Frigate birds invariably rested
on the highest perch possible and fought for
that vantage point. Gannets, terns, rails and
plovers stuck to the beach, except in the nest-
ing season, when they made the grass their
home.
“Tassie”: Surely “Bad Australian” in de-
scribing the horizontal scrub (B. 11/6/’27) is
not speaking from personal experience, other-
wise he would not refer to “a yielding basket-
work.” I have spent many years in the tim-
ber country on the Speck’s West Coast and
have always found the horizontal decidedly
unyielding. It is a densely packed mass of
tough, woody stems, measuring up to 4in. in
diameter and in some places attaining a
height of 20 feet, so that it would be almost
impossible to cut a track through it with
a slasher. A cane-knife would be equally

ineffective; a keen axe is the only successful
tool. “Horizontal,” whilst found in most of
the West Coast forests, grows abundantly on
the shores of the beautiful Gordon River,
but never, even at its densest, have I seen a
gully bridged by a pack track laid over the
scrub. Were this feasible it would solve
many problems for the harassed timberman.
* * * *
“C. Coral” : In Dutch New Guinea, bor-
dering on the British side, are some of the
fiercest Papuan headhunters, the Tugeri men.
They are tall and well built, somewhat pale
in complexion, and dress their hair in high
erections to give them dignity and inspire
awe. When on the warpath, their women
often fight alongside them. They used to
make periodic head-collecting raids on the
Torres Strait islands to the south, Saibai
and Dauan especially suffering from their
visitation. When the canoes approached and
the dread war-cry was heard, women and
children were placed inside bamboo palisades
for protection. On one occasion the Saibai men,
having prepared armed canoes filled with
big stones, went out to meet the invaders,
and when close enough hurled the boulders
into the enemy s more primitive craft. This
piece of strategy proved effective. Of late
years raids by the Tugeri men have not
been much in evidence, thanks to the re-
straining hand of Government; but recently
a party paddled down the coast towards the
New Guinea settlement opposite Saibai and
raised the old war-cry. Some of the other
inland tribes in that direction have also
been raiding neighboring villages to collect
their ghastly trophies.

“A Woman”: “Momokeni” (B. 26/5/’27>,
telling of a Papuan who said no woman could
make fire, asks if this applies to Australian
aboriginal women also. It does not. A black-
gin showed me how to make fire by holding-
down a dry grass-tree flower stem with the
foot and rotating a small stick in it till a
hollow was formed. The heat thus generated
caused fire in the fine powder set free by the
friction. I—a white woman—would never
lack a blaze if lost in the bush without
matches.

“Becjay”: The red-tailed black cockatoo
mentioned by “AdcL” (B. 16/6/’27) is num-
erous also on the Walsh River at the back of
Wolfram (N.Q.). where the dense timber and
the rugged nature of the country provide a
natural protection from enemies. Numbers of
these beautiful birds are shot for their tail
feathers —black with a red stripe—as they
can be treated and converted into fans, with
the result that one more of Australia’s
feathered tribe seems doomed to early extinc-
tion.

“Black Tracker”: The knowledge that
foxes and eagles arc on the alert to respond
to the cries of a trapped rabbit
lias been turned to profitable
account by Jim Abrahams,
whose headquarters are at
Avoea station, on the Darling.
By means of a small piece of
folded tin, perforated and placed
on the tongue, Jim imitates a
rabbit’s cry of distress to perfec-
tion. lie secretes himself in the
scrub, well out of the wind, with
Iris rifle ready for action, and
so irresistible is the cry that he
has had as many as six foxes
gathered round him at one time.
As for eaglehawks, lie recently
accounted for 43, for which he is
paid 2s. Gd. per head. The same
man has potted 3500 kangaroos
since September, 'O5.
“Brady’s Lookout”: Nobby was a hard
case. One day he and his mate were work-
ing on a grubbing job and found a hen's nest
with a lot of stale eggs in it—the mate
broke one to make sure and got hurriedly
to windward. Before making for camp that
night Nobby collected a dozen of the cleanest
eggs in the nest. “What’s the good of taking
them rotten things?” his mate asked. "Bet
yer beers they're as good as a dozen o’ the
best,” Nobby answered, and trudged on
carrying liis treasure carefully. After tea
Nobby went up to the store and bought a
dozen fresh eggs. They didn’t last long for
two hungry men, so two evenings later he
took his dud lot to the store. Calling the
storekeeper to the door, Nobby broke an egg
from his stock on the ground in front of him.
AFTER THE ACCIDENT.
SHORT-SIGHTED OLD LADY (to fallen airman ): “ Shameful! A big man like you robbing
poor little birds’ nests!”
Its stench was awful. “Gall these things
aigsV” roared Nobby. “If y’ don’t hop
another dozen out in place of ’em I’ll throw
the flamin' lot into yer store, where they
came from.” When Nobby returned to camp
lie counted a dozen fresh eggs on to the
table. "Twelve o’ the best” he said; “the hen
can have the others to cuddle in the mornin’.”
“Puketapu”: Goats will thrive on pretty
well everything except rhododendrons. At
Trentham (M.L.) we had three fine Angoras
until wo threw into the paddock some old
rhododendron bushes that were cluttering up
the garden. Like goats, the Angoras ate the
leaves and died of the poisonous properties of
the plant. Presumably rhodos. are not grown
in Rockhampton or Broken Hill.
“Sea Bream”: A party of us holiday-
making- on Magnetic Island (Q.) found a
porpoise stranded on the beach. Judging by
his distance from the water’s edge he had
been there for at least half an hour. We
pulled him to some near-by rocks, where
he remained out of water for four hours and
a half. Then we returned him to the sea,
still breathing. Though at first a bit sick, he
soon recovered, gave an exhibition of fancy
swimming and diving, and made off for the
open sea.
“Outback”: I used to wonder how the
trap-door spider finds its home after wander-
ing away. It has no great keenness of sight,
because it has to search diligently for the
lost burrow, and sometimes approaches it
several times before fixing its position. Gen-
erally in the tenant’s absence, the lid of the
burrow is left unclosed, and its locality is
then quickly seen. People sometimes ask
what becomes of the earth excavated from
the burrows. The work is carried on at
night, the earth being enclosed in little silken
bags; these are stacked about a yard away
for the purpose of making it appear decep-
tively that the. home is quite close. The
lid of the burrow has a bevelled edge which
fits exactly, and when pursued the spider
takes refuge in its trap-door house, pulling
the lid down as it enters.

“Gouger”: On the Murray, Darnley and
Stephen island groups the islanders are lucky
in the possession of very large and ingeni-
ously contrived fish-weirs, called “sai.”
These were built by Abob and Kos, who
introduced many crafts and spread culture
generally. The benefactors, having influenced
the Murray and Darnley islanders for the
betbr, changed their names and went to
Stephen Island, where they settled down and
taught the people many useful crafts. They
became the grand Zogo, and an impressive
shrine was built to them. The weirs are
kept in repair from year to year, but no
others have been built, so I understand, for
hundreds of years. With the incoming tides
great shoals, especially of blackfish, are often
trapped as the waters recede. These sheep-
yard-like weirs are built of stone and of
coral blocks, and their building called for
intelligence as well as labor.
* * * *
“Ham”: After IS months in the Niger
basin, where I caught most tropical com-
plaints, a doctor whom I consulted for mal-
arial boils ordered me home. I could not
go at that time but instead went to the
plateau, which is over 4000 feet above sea-
level. Six months later I again saw a doc-
tor, who said, “Get back to England ; you
have a spleen like a football, and you are
rotten with malaria." About that time I
read an Abo. contribution recommending
orange-peel for malaria. Oranges are scarce
in that country, but I saved all the peel
I could get, infused it as tea, and drank it.
Last .Tune I went on leave, and decided on
an overhaul at the tropical hospital. My
spleen was declared to be normal, with no
trace of malaria, although filaria was pre-
sent. I believe valuable results might flow
from research in this direction.
“C. Coral”: Pearls arc now eagerly
searched for and carefully husbanded by the
'Torres Strait divers; but only si half-cen-
tury ago they were considered of little value.
The boys used to play marbles on the lugger-
deck with the ocean gems. Even white divers
were not over-particular in handling them.
There is a story of one lady who, as a little
girl, was given a large pearl by a colored
diver; but for fear of hurting her parents’
feelings, since -the receiving of anything from
colored men was forbidden, she put the orna
ment into a bottle and buried it. Since then
diligent search has been made for the bottle
but it has never been recovered.
“Mako”: Off the West Coast of Maori-
land recently an angler brought up a; speci-
men of the rare harp-fish. This deep-sea
denizen resembles a snapper in shape, but
in color is reddish, with a rugged head and
black eyes. The fishermen of the neighbor-
hood hailed the catch delightedly. They
believe that the capture of a harp-fish is
always followed by a plenteous season.
* * * *
“Endymion”: An American scientist has
joined in the controversy as to whether ex-
posure to moonlight has harmful results to
sleeping human beings and butcher's meat or
fish. Professor Macht, of Johns Hopkins Uni-
versity, says that the old theories are correct.
Moonlight is “polarised” ; that is, the rays are
all on one plane. Plants of all descriptions—
including the yeasts, etc. —grow more rapidly
in moonlight than in daylight. On the other
hand moonlight neutralises the activity of
drugs such as quinine, and is dangerous to
aged or ailing animals. Its effect on fish is all
that the wiseacres of old ascribed to it. Arti-
ficially polarised light is even more active
than the moon-made variety, and in it the
professor hopes to locate the long-sought “in-
visible ray” which will rock a cradle or wipe
out an army.
LAKE NANNINE (W.A.).
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
On Lake Nan nine the thunders roll,
Reverberate and rend the skies,
But in her sleep-soft summer soul
She holds the still town’s silent sighs.
On Lake Nannine the black swans breast
The waveless waters at their ease.
Nor know the South lake’s creaming crest,
Nor scent the pungent plume-white seas.
Red desert girds your jewel blue
And glare-dim eyes your green gums seek,
All weary for a glimpse of you
From heat-hazed plain and mirage creek.
How splendid when the town was young
The giant clanging on the hill!
But all Nannine’s gay songs are sung—
The boilers rust, the stamps are still.
Some day the stamps may speak again,
A thundered paean thrill the skies,
The long lake hear the throbbed refrain
And, trembling, murmur her replies.

THE MAN ON THE LAND'S
PAGE
STACK ENSILAGE.
“Paul C.”: Many farmers and dairymen
still hesitate to make silage, on the plea
that the erection of a silo or the excavation
of a pit is too costly. This, however, need
not be an obstacle, for silage may be made
in a stack.
After a pit had been filled we had a good
deal of lucerne to be dealt with, so as an
experiment made a stack of it, putting the
harvest together as soon as cut; and although
rain had fallen while the work was going
on, the stack was completed. It was roofed
up like an ordinary haystack. Then a long
pole was laid along the ridge. Four other
poles, two on each side, fastened to each
other with wire, were placed along the roof,
one pole about a foot above the eaves and
the other midway between the ridge and
eaves. Then some heavy stockyard posts
fastened with wire thrown across the roof
were slung below the eaves. When the stack
was opened up six months later the silage
was found to be as sound and succulent as
that made in the pit. Certainly there was
some waste on the roof and sides; but if
the stack is well raked or “pulled” while
being built the amount lost by waste is not
worth consideration.
Such stacks may be made of wheaten,
barley or oaten hay, but not of maize or
sorghum, unless a framework of saplings is
erected. This framework may be constructed
of poles sunk in the ground about 34 feet
apart, their height depending on the height
one intends to make the stack. A pole the
length of the stack is fastened to the tops
of the vertical poles on each side. Then
cross-poles are lashed to the two side poles,
and the structure is kept perpendicular.
The maize or sorghum is placed in the
stack lengthwise; it may be finished with
a flat or skillion roof, preferably covered
with iron and weighted down with ballast;
but to avoid expense the stack can be topped
off with any valueless grass, weeds or handy
vegetation.
One point to be kept in mind is not to
cut. lucerne or cereal crops when they are
too young and too full of sap, as the re-
sultant silage is inferior in quality and
offensive in smell. Should it be really com-
pulsory to cut in this state, the objection
may be greatly reduced by allowing the
crop to wilt in the field before carting it
in; the time allowed would depend on the
season of the year or the kind of weather,
and the condition and weight of the crop.
FARM RECORDS.
“Olla Podrida”: Is this one? A White
Leghorn hen at Lindisfarne (Tas.) laid an
egg on June 21 which weighed 6 oz.—three
times the size of the average egg. It is
Sin. round the smallest part and 9in. round
the largest. The shell is thin and fragile.
“Brady’s Lookout”: “Bad Australian” (B.
16./6/’27) asks if 46 bags of oats off 15
acres is a champion for Australia. Reckon-
ing three bushels to the bag, his crop would
work out at 78 6-7 bushels per acre—-a tidy
crop but a long way from the top. S. Geard,
Mount Seymour, Parattah (Tas.), averaged
94 bushels white oats per acre this season
over six or seven times the area quoted by
“Bad Australian.” I have seen 65 bushels
of Algerian oats per acre threshed this year
in the Speck from land that has been in
cultivation for 100 years. The Algerians
were sown three bushels to the acre with
1001 b. super.
POISONING GREEN TIMBER.
“Sylvester”: I join in the warning against
the poisoning of hardwood timber. I tried
the arsenic-and-soda method on undergrowth,
painting it on the stubble after brushing.
The stubble died back to the main stump, and
I thought I was home and dry; but some
months afterwards it suckered .from the main
trunk again.
“Wirrah”: Tell “Taharangi” (B.
16/6/’27) that if he poisons his green timber
when the sap is going down (viz., late sum-
mer to late winter) he won’t have any
trouble with suckers. The poison will pene-
trate to the roots. If he is handling sandal-
wood at any time he can cut all the small
stuff off close to the ground with safety
during a wet winter and without poisoning.

“Dingo”: “Dinnis” (B. 23/6/’27) over-
looks the biggest lion in the path of the
Australian pig-raiser contagious pneu-
monia. Though a far less spectacular dis-
ease than swine fever, it causes a much
heavier annual loss, for, like tin; poor, it
is always with us. Of the piggeries in the
County of Cumberland (N.S.W.) 90 p.c.
are affected, and the disease is widespread
throughout Australia. In N. S. Wales two
out of every five pigs littered fail to become
of any economic use, and this failure is very
largely due to pneumonia. In Europe pro-
mising results have been obtained from
inoculation, but little or nothing in that
line lias been attempted here. Quarantine
and rigid hygiene will stamp it out, but
neither commends itself to the Australian
pig-raiser.
“Matar”: In Scandinavia when the- pigs
are born they are kept in darkness nut 1
they are six or eight weeks old. the sow
being let out for exercise for an hour or so
each day and given the pick of the food.
The young porkers receive nothing but what
their dam supplies them until they are re-
leased into light, and then they are given
all the green stuff they can devour. The
result is very quick growth and tender flesh
which commands a high price.
POTATO-GROWERS’ TROUBLES.
A young potato-grower asks these four
questions:—
(1) The best artificial manure to use for land
carrying slight amount of iron?
(2) The best method of dipping and spraying
to prevent Irish blight?
(8) The proper way of saving one’s own seed?
(4) Any way to stop the nematode?
These replies are furnished after consultation
with the N.S.W." Agricultural Department’s
potato expert
(1) Phosphate fertilisers are the most suitable in
all soils; but on some soils containing a percentage
of iron, the phosphoric acid may be rendered useless
unless applied in a form such as basic superphosphate.
Unfortunately the action of lime in potato soils tends
to favor scab; so the use of basic superphosphate
cannot be recommended. Bonedust should prove most
suitable, but green manuring is also recommended.
(2) Spraying is effective if commenced early, so
that at all times a protective coating of the spray
.covers the foliage. Bordeaux mixture is the most
suitable for the purpose.
(3) Every grower should establish a stud plot,
the nucleus to be the best-yielding roots, which should
bo selected at the digging of the main crop. Once
established, it is necessary to rogue out any plants
which have not a robust, healthy top-growth. The
whole of the progeny of the plot to be again
utilised for main-ci-op planting, again selecting the
highest-yielding roots for the stud plot next season.
Where no stud plot is established, select seed from the
late-sown crop, preferably one that has been frosted
before the top growth has normally ripened off.
Immature seed is considered of greater value than
mature seed.
(4) There is no effective method of eliminating
eel-worm (nematode) from soil except by steam
sterilising, which is impracticable on a big area.
A long rotation is all that can be recommended. Con-
tinual cropping of potatoes encourages the spread of
the disease. Cereals for hay or grain might be grown
on the soil.
VARYING QUALITY IN FLEECES.
“675”: No doubt “R. E. Combing" is
right that a good deal of the complaint
against the quality of our wool comes from
varying quality in the individual fleeces. This
is a fault which has grown worse with the
cutting-up of the big stations, and which
sheep classing should reduce or eliminate;
its extreme prevalence merely proves that
many flocks are not classed at all, or that
sheep are culled “on the gate” instead of
being culled by a competent man. I wonder,
though, if “R. E. Combing” _ noticed last
season, as I did, many clips in which the
apparent quality varied in the individual
fibre’ due to the extreme seasonal variations.
I found this very noticeable in some Southern
Queensland clips, and it made classing very
difficult, since the crimp in the lower part
of a staple often looked like 60‘s, while the
upper part of the same staple appeared
like, and actually was, a 70’s.
I have never tried “R. E. Combing s’
trick of rolling the fleece in sausage shape.
My method is to get a wool-roller on the
classer’s side of the rolling-table who is
capable of detecting a serious falling-off in
the quality on the breech, and who can
then be trusted either to divide the fleece
on his own responsibility or to call my
attention to it; indeed. I often roll one side
of the table myself, when this, work can be
handled satisfactorily. Certainly in some
clips the matter is serious, especially where
there is any Romney Marsh blood in the
flock’s history.
DORSET HORNS.
“R. Mort” : For the man on a small hold-
ing with trucking facilities to the nearest
town, a few Dorset Horns are a money-
making side-line. These sheep make prime
mutton and are very early maturing, a nine-
month lamb sometimes scaling up to 901 b.
dressed. The meat is succulent and of a fine
tlavor. They are hardy and will eat coarse
feed that other sheep would not look at. Also
they are amazingly prolific; 00 per cent, of
the ewes can be expected to drop pairs. If
attention is paid to fattening the lambs right
from the time they are dropped they can be
sold soon after four months and will bring a
good price. Speaking generally, the sooner
they are got rid of the greater the profit from
them. They will take the ram at any time,
another point in their favor for the man who
has his eye on a local market and aims at
supplying it regularly. There is little to be
made from the wool, which is short, light and
harsh.
THE BLOWFLY PEST.
“T.J.”: It was estimated recently that
Australia’s annual losses due to the blow-
fly were 24 millions; and adding the cost
of erutching, blowfly mixtures, iabor, etc.,
to the annual losses in sheep, wool and
lambs, it seems a conservative figure.
It is only during recent times that flies
have become numerous enough to be a serious
source of loss to the pastoralist. The rabbit
has been largely responsible. The careless
custom of leaving great masses of dead
skinned animals rotting in the sun has pro-
vided the fly with vast breeding grounds.
But, in particular, the practice of using a
slow poison like phosphorus in rabbit de-
struction should be discontinued. Phosphorus
is so slow in effect that the rabbit
is usually able to reach his burrow
before death takes place. Hidden from sight,
the carcase rots and becomes a depository for
fly-eggs, whereas, had it died above ground,
the carcase would have been eaten by birds
of prey, or possibly disposed of by human
agency. If every grazier burnt the carcases
of rabbits, sheep and large stock that died
on his run and utilised fly-traps extensively,
much good would result. Unfortunately,
some pastoralists take the necessary steps
and some don’t. It is hard luck for the former
that they cannot secure local immunity by
their diligence, but, unfortunately, netting
fences don’t stop the blowfly to any extent.
GOATS WITH THE SHEEP.
“M ora” : Marty different reasons are given
for the practice of running goats among
sheep, and sheepmen will argue indefinitely
about it. It has been proved, however, that
where a few goats—two or three per thou-
sand—run with a mob, the sheep keep in
good health. The goat’s ;roving instinct
keeps him on the move, and the sheep will
follow him. thereby obtaining necessary
exercise and preventing sluggishness. This
is particularly beneficial to ewes in lamb,
especially in a good season, when they are
fat.
DRAFT ALLOWANCE.
“675”: Surely it is time that something
was done to abolish the ridiculous impost on
the wool industry of Australia which goes
by the name of “Draft Allowance” and
under which the grower allows the buyer to
pay for 1121 b. of wool while receiving 1131 b.
—a gift of .9 p.c., which, calculated on the
published basis of tho value of the last
wool-clip, was worth some .£500,000
It is a relic of the days of our forefathers,
when wool, with all other heavy commodi-
ties, was weighed by means of a “beam,” or
steelyard, and the lib. per cwt. allowed by
the seller to the buyer was regarded as the
amount necessary to “tip” the beam. Modern
scales are accurate, and woolbrokers keep
their scales in this condition by regular
examinations and employ sworn * weighers.
What reason, then, can there be for the
retention of the bonus to the buyer?
I have heard it stated that the abolition
of the system would necessitate the buyers
altering the basis of their calculations. That
may be so; on the other hand, it may be
that the manufacturers, who eventually re-
ceive the benefit of the impost, regard it as
“bunce,” in the same way as the local
buyers regard the disposal of the floor
sweepings from the brokers’ stores, the pro-
ceeds from which they claim as their pro-
perty, and the sale of which results in a
tidy cheque at the end of each season. In
any case, no adequate reason has ever been
advanced why this pernicious system should
continue —pernicious, because the seller does
not, in effect, receive the price bid for his
wool, and because an infinity of avoidable
clerical work is involved in the necessary
calculations, which, in the case of the co-
operative companies at least, is also paid
for by the Australian grower.
The woolbrokers could very easily effect
the required change. An announcement by
tho combined brokers that after a certain
date all wool would be sold under the weight
conditions which apply to every other com-
modity—payment in full for every pound
delivered —would effectually bring things to
a normal basis.
It is remarkable that the graziers of
Australia have not complained more loudly.
Any one of them individually regards it
as an unjustifiable extortion, but no com-
bined and determined effort: has yet been
made to rid the trade of this incubus.
THE ALSATIAN.
“Cave Canem”: The Graziers’ Associa-
tion, sitting at Adelaide, resolved the other
day to ask the authorities to prohibit the
importation and breeding of Alsatian dogs
in Australia. The reason is, of course, that
the animal, with its size, strength and intel-
ligence, is likely to greatly aggravate the
menace of the wild and semi-wild dog which
has of late years been giving cause for such
serious concern to sheep-breeders.
It is accepted nowadays that Australia's
wild red dog, the dingo, is a mere circum-
stance beside the “tame” dog gone wild, and
especially that mongrel product of wild and
tame dogs which has been steadily supplant-
ing the dingo proper, and proving itself
stronger, brainier and more ferocious than
either of its forebears. The prospect of
adding an Alsatian strain to this already
formidable combination is not encouraging.
The merits of the bi’eed, which owes its
present popularity largely to American
“movies” that have exploited its acute in-
telligence to the utmost, have been fiercely
canvassed. Its detractors say it goes only
a few dog-generations back to a wolf-cross.
Its admirers, with all the traditional enthu-
siasm of the man who sticks up for liis pet
tyke, gives this a denial. The dog is a
children’s pet, catches nothing more valu-
able than flies, and, finally, is no wolf-
cross. but of a long-established breed which
for centuries has been fostered in Alsace
for the express nurpose of tending and
guarding sheep. This last statement is gen-
erally regarded as a clincher. It is an un-
fortunate argument, for everyone with a
firsthand knowledge of the sheep-killer will
admit that the worst type is the sheepdog
which has actually taken to the bush, except
it be that occasional specimen which works
amiably among liis charges by day and then
slips away at night to work havoc among
them.
BONE-CHEWING IN CATTLE.
“Azac”: Let me assure “V.A.G.” (B.
23/6/'27) that there is nothing mysterious
in bone-chewing cattle benefiting by a change
from young green fodders to lucerne hay and
oaten hay.
Primarily, the cause of bone-cliewing is
soil poverty, particularly as regards lime and
phosphates. If these are lacking the pastures
and crops cannot possibly contain those very
essential elements required for the formation
of bone material in cattle and for making
milk. To dry-off an affected cow is there-
fore good practice, as it conserves for use in
her body the lime and phosphates that would
otherwise go to form milk. That is also the
reason why the complaint is more severe in
milking cows than in dry stock.
Bone-chewing is not in itself a disease, but
is the symptom or a diseased condition,
and is not unlike rickets in the poorly-fed
children in England. Any measures to combat
the complaint must aim at supplying those
items that are deficient.
There are a number of curatives available
Feed two or three tablespoons of bone-meal
daily ; or, if the cows arc not hand-fed, tin
following lick can be made up and put out
in troughs in the paddocks, or even in the
bails: Salt 40 parts, sulphate of iron 1 part,
and bone-meal up to 40 or 50 parts, accord-
ing to the severity of the complaint. Bran
or oil cake should form part of the daily
food, and lucerne hay. being rich in most of
the elements usually deficient, will be found
ideal.
Within recent years the top-dressing of
the natural pastures with superphosphate
lias come into favor, and is destined to be a
very big factor in lessening the bone-chewing
nuisance on poor lands. laming the pas-
tures has been found beneficial in some
cases; but superphosphate contains both lime
and phosphates. The idea of top-dressing
is to promote more vigorous growth in the
natural pastures, and also to bring along
clovers, and it was not till after tho work of
top-dressing had been going some years that
its value to bone-cliewers was realised.
Doubters should top-dress a small patch in
the middle of a grazing paddock and notice
how the cattle soon find it and eat it down
bare, while the pasture all around is com-
paratively neglected.
THE BUFFALO FLY.
“FY7”: The Australian cattle-breeder’s
woes are added to by the spread south-east
of the Northern Territory buffalo fly. This
small, black bloodsucker nrobably came from

the Malayan archipelago with the first buf-
faloes, but only of late years has it been a
pest to cattle and horses in the Territory. It
is now’ w 7 ell down towards the N.Q. herds.
’Phe Federal Council for Scientific and Indus-
tidal Research some months ago sent an
official north, and his report confirnfs The
Bulletin’s early intimations of the danger-
ous spread of the pest.
In its Asian haunts the fly is not a menace
to cattle, and the presumption is that it has
natural enemies there. It is in the search
for these that the Federal authorities will be
asked to assist further. The Dutch Indies
authorities have offered to supply a native
veterinary staff for research if the small cost
is guaranteed by the Australian Government,
while help has been sought from centres as
far apart as the Philippines and Hawaii. The
fly has been introduced with the buffalo to
Hawaii, but has not developed as it has done
in Northern Australia, and it is hoped that
valuable information may result from this
quarter.
The fly is not a disease carrier like the
tick. Its habit is to cluster thickly on the
bare parts of' the animal’s body, including
the eyes and bases of the horns. The loss of
blood and continued irritation soon reduce
cattle to skeletons, with subsequent death by
exhaustion.
THE STUPID POULTRY MARKET.
“Jack Point”: Rearing poultry to sell for
meat in Australia is a mug’s game unless
you find your own market. Plenty of sub-
urban poultry-farmers make a tidy thing
out of selling really good table birds to
hotels and restaurants that w’ant prime stuff,
but a rude awakening aw 7 a its the unsophisti-
cated who “tops off” good birds and sends
them to the open market, which is about the
only one available to the man any distance
out. Generally the birds are sold in the coops
in which they have come by rail, and
buyers only go by what they see —they
don’t get much opportunity to handle. The
demand for good stuff exists, but as the
buyer doesn’t know 7 whether he is getting
good or not he pays the price set by worn-
out layers. When the poultry-farmers of Aus-
tralia have put the egg-export business on its
feet (and wonderful w ? ork has been done
here during the last three years) there is
the problem of table birds to be tackled.
Meantime those who know 7 how to fatten
hens and cockerels would be well advised
to make their own salt 7 arrangements.
SLITTING FRUIT-TREE BARK.
“D.R.”: Cutting the bark of trees to in-
crease fruit-bearing as recommended by
“A. 8.” (B. 2/G/’27) is or ought to be as
obsolete as the bleeding of humans and
animals.
The bark-bound condition is evidence of
neglect of ordinary orchard practice. The
best results can be obtained by spraying
with oil in the winter or very early spring.
The making of open wounds by perpendicu-
lar slitting or any other mutilation of the
bark permits spores of fungus to-enter and
rest until conditions favor germination.
Spray-oil stimulates the bark until it cracks
naturally and permits of a good development
of healthy tissue, which will grow up through
the bark, leaving the new under-bark pro-
tected. Even amputations are now disin-
fected and protected by white- or red-lead
or grafting wax.
Apricots respond best to the oil-spray of
one in twenty-five, while from one in ten to
one in fifteen proves best for pip fruits here
—I speak of Maoriland.
MURRAY IRRIGATION PRODUCTS.
“K.K.”: “Croesus” urges that the Murray
River settlers should root out gordos and
currants and grow “profitable sidelines,” pre-
sumably rice, cotton, tobacco and “other
commodities.” This can hardly be called a
constructive suggestion to. tide us over what
1 repeat is only a temporary difficulty in
the case of lexias and currants, and particu-
larly as we have already found that one of
the lines suggested by him (tobacco) won’t
grow here, another (rice) w r ould not show a
gross return that would pay for the water
required, and the third (cotton) on a 17-
acre block would not allow 7 a man £4 a
w 7 eek, apart from such items as rates and
liorsefeed. Most of us are carrying as many
sidelines as the experience of our district
indicates it is safe to carry, and in the newer
areas gordos and currants themselves are
regarded as sidelines.
“Croesus” refers to growers who “disdain
.... to pick the olives from their trees. . . .
or often to bother marketing their pears and
peaches.” He fails to realise that sidelines
(olives and peaches) do not necessarily pay,
and also to mention whether the local olive-
oil factory was operating at the time of the
growers’ disdainful neglect, or if the price
of the particular variety of peaches at the
lime of the alleged neglect would have paid
for the cost of picking and freight. lie
refers also to my “delightful non seqnitnr
that if the Australian price were reduced the
consumption w’ould not increase.” I cannot
help it, but the fact remains that decreased
Australian consumption did follow decreased
price three years ago when there was a reduc-
tion of 2d. a pound in one variety, the reason
being, I understand, that the trade was dis-
inclined to handle a controlled line w 7 hose
price was apparently not stable, for fear
that a further reduction might be made.
“Croesus” can add to his long list of errors
the statement that overseas fruit is expen-
sively handled. It actually costs more to
sell our fruit to the Brisbane grocer than it
does, to place it with the Liverpool or London
retailer, the 10.000 or so extra miles, addi-
tional ocean freight notwithstanding. It
costs district growers from £l7 to £24 a
ton to market their fruit in the Common-
wealth, and approximately £22 to £2O in
the U.K.
HINTS FOR THE FARM.
“Chap I.”: The decay of organic matter
(crop, residues, straw 7 and roots) in the
soil, gives rise to the formation of humic acid
if lime is not present in sufficient quantities.
That acidity w 7 ill prevent the action of the
farmer s most useful groups of bacteria, the
nitrogen-gathering ones in particular. Moulds
and fungi of many kinds, and many weeds,
are favored by an acid condition of the soil.
The “branching” in turnip and other root
crops due to the lack of lime is well known. It
is up to the farmer to sweeten his soil, kill
his weeds and help his little cobbers, the
nitrogen- (and cash-) collectors by giving lime
a trial. . He can put it through his drill
if he likes. It is better to put it on some
time before cropping—better when the soil
is moist. But again he must not forget sup-
plementary manures.
“Stump Jump”: I think that “Homo’s”
quantities of copper carbonate (B. 9/6/'27)
are much too light. Using a wheat-pickler,
1 found that it requires 2oz. of powder to
thoroughly dust a bushel. Smaller quanti-
ties leave a big percentage of grain not
dusted. Seed-wheat may look free from
smut, and yet be covered with hundreds of
smut seeds unseen by the naked eye. To
obviate the drill clogging with the dust,
sow through the oat-runs.
“Two Seas” : For “pink eye” in sheep try
this cure. Upend the animal, draw his
lower eyelid outward and drop a pinch of
boracic acid powder into the little pouch
thus formed. There is no waste as there is
with liquids, as the winking caused by the
powder spreads it over the eyeball until it all
dissolves. I have cured sheep that were
practically blind by this cheap and simple
method. Have also used it successfully on
horses suffering from ophthalmia. Good for
man and beast —no one in the bush should be
without a supply of boracic-acid powder.
“Barrapinta”: Nearly every circular saw
for cutting firewood is run too fast, and
the result is a big loss of power and a blunt
saw. For the average saw 2ft. in diameter,
1000 revolutions per minute is quite suffi-
cient. Regulating the speed of the saw is
simple enough. Most oil and petrol engines
have a governor which regulates their speeds,
and the number of revolutions is stated on a
brass-plate screwed on the engine-bed. Cal-
culating the speed of the saw is then a simple
bit of arithmetic based on the difference in
circumference between the driving pulley
and the pulley on the saw spindle. If the
saw proves to be doing more than 1000
revs, per minute, lit a larger pulley to the
saw spindle.
“R. Mort”: Common salt, besides being the
farmer’s best friend (B. 2/(>/’27), is also
useful to the grazier. Hand-fed sheep can do
with a day, and experiments show that
animals so treated put on weight at the rate
of lib. a month. They also cut a heavier
fleece, with the quality of the wool improved.
“Wirrali”: While I was managing a
Queensland station during the 1915 drought
one of our best stud-cows got bogged in
a bore-drain, and when found was past
recovery. Being loth to lose the calf, which
was close at hand, I decided on an experi-
ment. We first put a bullet through her
brain, and without losing any time operated,
removing the calf. After about 10 minutes’
artificial respiration the young fellow stood
up and shook himself. He was given a
foster-mother and turned out one of the best
bull-calves of the season.
“Sylvester”: Seedlings ai’e often worse
than suckers. Anyone falling hardwood
country, and intending to leave some timber
standing, would be well advised to ring-
bark it long enough before falling to have
all seed down so that it may burn in the
fire. I didn’t, and the seed came down on
the clean ground after the fire, and I got
a fine strike. Spotted-gum (E. macula,ta)
is about the worst offender in this respect,
and is also about the hardest undergrowth
to kill.
“Dulmoon”: “Exorcus” (B. 19/5/’27) is
wrong when lie states that Üba sugar-cane
is immune to Mosaic disease. Quite a lot
of Üba in the Mackay district was badly
affected last year, especially old ratoons.
Mosaic becomes more pronounced in each
succeeding ratoon crop until the whole field
is affected. Üba is grown because it ratoons
for many years with little or no cultivation,
making the control of Mosaic difficult; or
practically impossible. Which means that
before many years Üba will go out of culti-
vation. By the way, I don’t think there is
one variety of cane growing in Queensland
that is really immune to Mosaic. Some, of
course, are affected more than others.
t- * * *
“Glenfield” : In days gone by the mallee-
root was troublesome to the cocky in a
hurry; after a ploughing, the paddock is
littered with stumps which have to be picked,
heaped and burnt or carted off before another
implement can work over the land. Now
cocky is rejoicing, for the mallee-root has
become first favorite as fuel with the city
housewife, as it gives a splendid heat and
burns away to a clean white ash. The wood-
carter is more than willing to pick the pad-
dock clean, free of cost; and if Cocky is a
bit short he can cart and truck a few tons
himself.
* * * *
“Taharangi” : If you want to know why a
hen cackles, take up a comfortable position
near the poultry and watch the boss rooster.
If he is a brisk and capable lad. he sprints
across to the hilarious lady with a wicked
gleam in his eye, and there is a short inter-
lude of connubial felicity. Every female
gives some sort of indication of her readi-
'ness to propagate the species, and cackling
in as good a way as any. The hen, knowing
that life is full of uncertainty, wants to get
to-morrow’s egg fertilised as soon as to-day's
is out of the way.
* * * *
“Pick”: Recent Queensland experiments
have thrown light upon the respective values
of wheat and maize as sheep drought-fodder.
The measure of wheat that kept a sheep
going for seven days, if served in the larger
grain, kept the animal for five days only.
* * * *
“Jacques”: According to “Spike” (B.
2S/4/'27), a first-grade cow may successfully
rear twins, provided they are uniform when
dropped. She can also rear them if they are
not. What I want to know is whether both
twin calves can breed on reaching maturity.

“Adamascus”; Re restoring banana land
(P>. 26/5/’27). Growers around Yeppoon
(C.Q.) find that land on which lantana has
been burned off is eminently suitable for
banana cultivation without any treatment
with fertilisers. Probably the lantana con-
tains a high percentage of the potash -which
the banana plant needs most of all.

The bell is set a-ringing, and the
engine gives a toot,
There’s five-and-thirty shearers
here a-shearing for the loot,
So stir yourselves, you penners-up,
and shove the sheep along—
The musterers are fetching them a
hundred thousand strong —
And make your collie dogs speak
up; what would the buyers say
In London if the wool was late
this year from Castlereagh?
—“BANJO” PATERSON
So wrote our “Banjo” Paterson
some thirty years ago,
When toiling bullock-wagons made
the journey long and slow,
But now the wool is never late
coming from Castlereagh,
For on a speeding REO Truck the
bales are borne to-day.

THE LIGHTNING CALCULATOR.
W e stood in the broad bow window of
the vacant house.
“Sec those iron railings on the front
fence?” I said. “You may not believe me,
but there are forty-six, including the bent
one.”
When he had finished counting them, the
estate agent looked wonderingly at me.
“You’re a lightning calculator, all right,”
he said.
I merely smiled.
“And see that house over there?” I said,
pointing to the opposite side of the street.
“Counting from the cornice, there are sixty-
four row's of bricks down to foundation level.
Bricks outlined in white like those are easy
to count.”
The estate agent eyed me uneasily. Fas-
cinated, nevertheless, lie again commenced
counting, only to find that my figures were
perfectly correct.
“How in the name of all that’s won”
he began.
“It’s not wonderful at all,” I said. “In
fact, it’s quite simple, old chap. But let’s
have a look at the wall-paper in this room.”
The agent’s face fell. “I’m afraid the
owner won’t go to the expense of re-paper-
ing,” lie said. “At the very low rental
we’re asking it's out of the ques”
“I don’t want the room re-papered,” I
said. “On the contrary, if there was any
other paper on the wall I wouldn’t like it
half so well. See that design that looks
like spanners crossed inside a motor-tyre,
repeated every ten and three-quarter inches,
with a space of one foot two between the
rows? Between the window and the fire-
place there are fifty-seven of them.”
The agent’s sporting instinct rose like
a river in a cloudburst. This was too much.
“I’ll bet you a quid there aren’t!" he
exclaimed.
“Easy money,” I said. “It would be
a shame to take it. However, if you don’t
believe me, let’s count them together.”
We did, and the total was fifty-seven, as
I knew it would be.
The agent backed away from me. 11 is
thoughts were reflected in his face.
“Wlia —what’s the bright idea?” he man-
aged to ask at last, trying to appear calm
and collected. “Did you ever live in this
house?”
“No,” I replied. “But my dentist did,
and his chair was here in front of the bow
window, just where we are standing. I
merely used to count those railings, those
bricks and those designs on the wall-paper
when lie was using the drill on me, or when
lie stuffed napkins and braces in my mouth,
telling me lie wanted the filling to dry. By
the way, can you see a sailing-ship becalmed,
with a cloudy sky behind her, in that stain
on the ceiling? It took me two fillings and
an extraction to get that picture.”
Viciously cranking up his car, the estate
agent leapt into it and, with a final con-
temptuous glance, left me.

Miss BERTHA RICCARDO, a beautiful
Rexona Girl, now playing second ieaa tn
-Tip Toes” throughout the States, writes:
“I always use Rexona Soap. It IS un ~
doubtedly the best soap for the skin
, and hair.”
Girls!
Beautify Your
Hair.
Do you know that in less than ten minutes you can
double the beauty of your hair? It becomes light,
wavy, fluffy, abundant, and appears as soft, lustrous
and charming as anyone could desire after a simple
wash with Rexona Soap.
A delightful surprise awaits those whose hair has
been neglected, or is scraggy, dry, brittle or thin.
Rexona Soap cleanses the hair of all dust, dirt 01
excess oil, and in a few moments you have doubled
the beauty of your hair. Rexona Soap dissolves
every particle of dandruff, cleanses, purifies and
invigorates the scalp, for ever stopping itching and
falling hair.
If you care to have pretty hair and lots of it, get a
tablet of Rexona Soap to-day.
Why
Not Enjoy a
Good Complexion?
You cannot if you do not care for the delicate skin
of the face. VFhen you wash your face do you
realise that it is not enough to simply remove the
dirt, but that your skin needs a soothing, healing
influence to keep your complexion fresh and free
from blemish? Scented toilet soaps are often very
pleasant but do not assert this influence, as you are
well aware. Many of them contain free alkali,
which tends to dry up the skin and destroy its
delicate texture.
Even the better class of such soaps do not in any
way help to improve the skin, but Rexona Skin and
Facial Soap is not only an absolutely pure soap,
but is medicated on the same principle as the famous
Rexona Ointment, which is known throughout
Australasia as the Rapid Healer.
That is why Rexona Soap really does for the skin
and face what cosmetics are supposed to do, by
ensuring not only a clean face, but a pure and
healthy skin, and thus gives you a clear complexion.

Sentence of Death.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
AN extraordinarily meek and pliant little
man was Hodman Dennikin. He
grinned and bore, and the more lie
bore the more he grinned, which was his way
of making the best of a bad job. It gave
you an uncertain feeling as to what was in
his mind ; whether he was more bored or more
grinning; whether he was really liking you or
whether he was just making the best of you
because you were there and he was too
polite to go away.
On the boat between the Quay and Mos-
man Dennikin thought it all out. “Give you
a year,” Plummer had said, “and come and
see me again to-morrow.” Very well, then.
A year wasn’t long. God knew it wasn’t long
after a solid thirty of domestic drudgery!
Nine to five, day in, day out; and, "Please
get tickets for the show, Herman ; we really
must see it; the Collanders are going!” Or,
“Ten bob a week's the very least, Dad, a
chap can show his face with at a public
school!”
A milking cow—that’s what lie was; a
milking cow for the family.
Yes, yes, yes! It had been a jolly old
money-go-round. And this was the end of it.
A year more! A year more money-go-round.
Well, it wasn’t going to be a money-go-
round, it was going to be a merry-go-round—
for him! Money was no object in his family.
Very well, then —it wouldn’t be. He’d have
a year of glorious life to wind up with; some
sort of repayment for the years between
twenty and fifty that he had given to re-
producing and supporting his species; to
bearing and grinning; to grinning and being-
bored.
Maybe that was all eternity amounted to,
after all. Well, lie had done his bit for
eternity; he wasn’t going to grin any more.
The idea of countless icons' of floa|ting
about the empyrean listening to the music
of the spheres (which he took it was the
revised view of Heaven), or working inter-
minably on one’s back under an infernal
motor-engine that would never start (which
he took to be the scientific explanation of
Hell), had no particular Jure for Herman.
He would have a year of the life he knew
at its best; the best his money could buy.
What would lie do? His mind began send-
ing out long, floating, streamered tentacles of
selective thought over the darkening harbor
waters, and the man next him coughed and
drew liis scarf tighter round his throat as
though Herman’s mind-researches were tick-
ling his bronchi. The cough sounded
strangely remote. Distance and water. The
Islands!
He thought of a man he had once read
about who owned an island and kept the
black men as slaves. There was no water
on the island, but he had the winter rains
conserved in cisterns, and then he built
fountains, and relays of slaves worked day
and night pumping water for his fountains
because he could not sleep without the sound
of running water in his ears; and woe be-
tide his subjects if anything went wrong
with the water-works and interfered with
his slumbers.
Dennikin smiled. He would like that.
Groans for grins. A dictator! An auto-
crat ! An ego with a kingdom of fulfilled
desires at his feet!
The island. Treasure Island. Faugh ! lfe
wasn’t a schoolboy. He didn’t want any
dusky maidens, or lotus flowers, or slave-
worked fountains, either. Sydney was good
enough for him. His home was good
enough for him.
A. girl on his other side began surreptiti-
ously to pull up her long silk stockings so
that they would be creaseless when she
got off the ferry. Herman watched her im-
personally.
As he stepped ashore he chuckled to him-
self. Death sentence! A year! It was
funny. He chuckled. And as he chuckled he
threw his head back and his chest out, and
there was a spring in his step.
He imagined Death standing behind him.
He imagined himself laughing.
He stopped at a public telephone and
called up his daughter.
“Bring the car down to the ferry, please!”
lie ordered.
“What!" said Betty.
“Bring the car down for me, and hurry
up!”
“But. Dad. I’m just washing my hair.
I'm going to dinner at the Spendforth to-
night. Is anything wrong?”
“Is it my car?” roared Dennikin over
the phone. “Are you mv daughter?”
“Good Lord!” said Betty, and he heard
her call out, “Mum, I think Dad’s gone mad !
Can you go down to the ferry for him in the
car? I’m washing my hair!” and ho heard
his wife answer, “What! can’t he walk?
Is he ill? I’m arranging the flowers and
it's time I was dressing. Look at these
stocks.”
“Betty!” he roared. “Tie your head in
a towel, or a bag or a knot, and come down
this instant or I’ll disinherit the lot of
you!”
He hung up, and in a few minutes Betty,
looking very sulky, drove up.
As lie got in, Betty said, “I hope you
know you’ve spoilt the wave in my hair.’’
“I don't think I am called upon to perpetu-
ate my species to the extent of a hair wave
that isn't there to be reproduced,” said Denni-
kin.
Betty looked at him sharply, and drove
home without saying another word. When
they were inside she said to her mother, “Dad
must be getting dengue fever; you’d better
take his temperature.”
“Not feeling well, dear?” said his wife
tranquilly, as she sipped the same cool,
sweet, little quarter-to-six kiss off his cheek
that she had taken for twenty-five years.
“Fine!” said Herman, seizing her round
the waist and giving her a bear’s hug that
crushed a fine head of stock she was about
to .put in a vase. Then he kissed her five
times on the lips, in front of their own
daughter.
“Heavens!” gasped Mrs. Dennikin, strug-
gling. “What’s wrong with you?” and she
turned a faint pink because she detested a
display of emotion in public, and she thought
she heard Betty giggle, as she knew Betty
certainly would.
“Wrong? Nothing's wrong! Everything's
very right. God’s in his Heaven, the snail's
on the thorn —this is my lucky year!”
STICKING TO THE LETTER.
THE BOSS: “Hi! Stop knocking those sheep about, you blanky idiot!"
CHUM: “But you sent me to keep the trough full, sir , and the woolly blighters be
wantin' to drink it!”
“Have you won Tatt.’s or have you been
drinking?” said Betty.
“Neither; I am about to pluck a brand
from the burning, and my soul from the
oppressor.”
“You sound about ready for a lunatic
asylum; but if you only think you’re being
funny,” said, Betty.
But Mrs. Dennikin interrupted. “You’ll
be late for your party if you don’t mind,
Betty.”
"Oh. I’m not going now!” announced
Betty darkly.
Herman Dennikin threw himself into a
chair and lit a cigar.
“Not going? Herman!”
“I wouldn’t be seen dead with my hair
like this!” Betty’s eyes were very black.
“What! What's the matter with your
hair? Ucrm an!”
“Well?'’ said Dennikin, looking up from
a magazine and carefully blowing a large
volume of smoke into the room.
“It's all Dad’s tomfoolery!” burst out
Betty. “I was just putting the wavers in.
Dad! Can’t you see mother’s asking you
not to smoke in here?”
Dennikin moved not an eyelash. “Is
she?” he said. "1 didn't hear her.”
“You know I don’t allow cigars in here,
Herman.”
Betty planted herself in front of him.
“Don’t you think you’ve done enough dam-
age for one day ?”
“Groans,” said Dennikin imperturbably,
“do you know I feel immense! This is a
riff-raff magazine.” lie emitted enough
smoke for a factory chimney, and threw
the magazine on the floor.
“Really,” said his wife, “Herman, this
is too much ; you must have been drinking.
You know that is my new Gan,led Grey
Matter! The cover alone is a masterpiece!”
“Alone!” said Herman.
“You have barely time to dress for din-
ner; perhaps a hot bath will improve your
manners.... Go along, Betty, and don’t be
so foolish about your hair. If you hurry
and take a taxi you won’t be more than a
few minutes late. You may wear my acqua-
mariues to make up.”
“Ho, no, she mayn’t!” said Dennikin,
sitting up. “Do you think I pay six
guineas for a string of glass to hang round
the neck of that —that unmannerly, un-
gracious, spiteful, cantankerous, gauche,
hideous, depraved young flapper-hoodlum?”
“Dad!” cried Betty, stamping both her
feet. “I don’t know whether you are mad
or drunk, but either you will leave this
house or I will!”
She felt that really nothing better could
be said under the circumstances.
“Oh no, you won’t! And neither will I! In
short, tee won't; so that’s that. This is
my house and you are my daughter—-God
forgive me for having you !”
“Betty,” said Mrs. Dennikin, “lie has been
drinking; you had better leave the room,
we don’t want a drunken brawl. I will deal
with him!”
“Leave the room?” shouted Betty. “I
will leave the house, you—you drunken
beast!” and she went out and slammed
the door.
When she had gone Dennikin started to
laugh, and the more he laughed the more
lie wanted to laugh. He laughed loudly and
heartily and continuously, and he could not
stop laughing.
It was charged with all the bored grins
of twenty-five years; all the irony of life.
He laughed and he laughed, and his wife
stood like a stately, contemptuous sphinx
and looked at him.
Never in all her twenty-five married years
had she seen her husband behave so out-
rageously. He never drank to excess: he
was the sanest and mildest-mannered man
in the world. She wished the boys would
come home, for she felt a little scared.
Then came a roar and a rush, and the
car whizzed past the window, and driving
it was Betty. And as she went past, she
yelled, “I’m not coming back!”
“Stop!” shouted Dennikin, and then in
real alarm, “The child’s mad!”
“Why did you provoke her? You know
how headstrong she is!”
“Headstrong! Am I lo be bossed by my
own daughter? Am / never to he head-
strong? I’m going to catch that minx and
bring her back and make her say she’s sorry!
Where’s your car?” He jumped out of the
window.
“Herman,” called his wife, “don’t be fool-
ish ; she won’t go far; it's only temper, and
you know I don’t like anyone else driving
my car!”
“You be Flowed!” shouted Herman as
he tore past and out of the gate with a
fine disregard of posts and gutters.
As soon as Betty found her father was
following her, she speeded up, and soon they
were on the road to Hornsby, racing like
lunatics. People turned to watch ; policemen
waved in vain; pedestrians lied for their
lives, and the morning paper had a para-
graph about an exciting chase of a C.I. car
after a notorious gang of burglars. “No-
thing could stop them,” ran the paragraph.
"This is a fine example of the length of the
long arm of the law on wheels.”
At Gordon Bridge Betty ran out of pet-
rol. With a long, sighing, sobbing sound the
big Chandler stopped, and Betty fell faint-
ing in the seat.
When she came to, she tasted brandy in
her mouth, and her father’s arm was under
her shoulder, and her father’s voice—yes, it
was her father’s voice, but it sounded funny
—-was saying, “Game old kid! Dear little
Betty. There, there, sweetheart, now you're
all right!”
“Well,” said Betty, struggling into an up-
right position, “where are we? Well, I’m
damned!”
“Sh-h,” said her father.
“Well, I am!”
“No, you’re not; you’re Betty, my daugh-
ter!”
“God forgive you!”
“Hush, child! I wish you weren’t so pre-
cocious ; it hurts me when you talk like
that.”
“Oh-h, all right,” said Betty! “sorry old
Fuzz-buzz.” She stretched herself like a
tawny, elastic young kitten patronising a
solicitous parent. “I suppose we'd hotter
drive back now.”
“Yes,” said Dennikin, “and I am going
first!” '
“All right,” said Betty meekly. “I’ll get
smothered in dust, of course.”
“Yes, you will get smothered in dust, but
it will do you good.”
“Oh, I suppose it won’t take more than
a year off my life!”
Dennikin winced. “Come on, then; we’ll
be keeping dinner. Shull’s kiss and be
friends?”
Betty threw her arms round his neck and
a little tvet mouth pressed his.
“Silly old Daddy,” she gurgled; “I didn’t
think you could be so nice and wicked!”
“Humph,” said Dennikin ; “well, I like
that!” and he cranked his car.
The next day, when Dennikin toiled up
Macquarie-street, the doctor wanted to know
if he had taken monkeygland overnight.
“Why?” said Dennikin.
“I never saw such an extraordinary change
in anybody; you seem to be all toned up!”
“Don’t tell me I’m not going to die!”
said Dennikin.
“Goodness knows! You’re billed to die;
nothing surer; conglomeration of the sternal
uvula, for which, up to date, I am sorry to
say, there is no cure. But it’s extraordinary
what you can live with if you have the will.
Yesterday you had none; to-day you’re teem-
ing with it!”
“Don’t you try to take my year from me
now,” said Herman Dennikin. “Pm going to
die, ain’t, I?”
“Search me, man! You never can tell.
Some people live to a ripe old age when by
all the laws of God and man they ought to
be running a private and invisible aeroplane
service—even of conglomerated uvulas.”
“Humph,” said Herman Dennikin.
And it is certainly a fact that at the time
of writing Dennikin is as alive as ever
he was, if not more so.

to make it a mighty fine gun for all-round use. It shoots the well-known
.22 W. R. F. Cartridge, loaded with 7 grains of powder, and a 45-grain
FLAT POINT bullet —either solid or hollow point. Being INSIDE
LUBRICATED, this ammunition is always clean to handle. There is
no exposed grease to pick up grit' or dust, and it may therefore be
carried loose in the pocket without risk of its efficiency being impaired.
The slender 6in. barrel of this COLT, with its finely adjustable Target Sights and perfect rifling,
tile full grip and the high quality of fitting and workmanship for which its name is famous,
combine to make it capable of such extreme accuracy that good shooting can be done with it
at 100 yards and over.
Every owner of a Model SO Winchester Repeating Rifle shooting the .22 W.R.F.
Cartridge should consider the advantages of adding this Colt to his armory.

business. No opposition. Lease to run three
years, option another three years. llow do
I value the goodwill? —776.
There is no formula. Some businesses
might be worth six years’ purchase; some
are not worth three months’. Goodwill may
disappear with the man who has been run-
ning the business; or it may depend chiefly
upon the location, which may be lost; or
upon agencies which a new owner may not
be able to keep; or upon an industry near
by which may be either growing or totter-
V” "i u P° n the likelihood of competition
(and that is governed largely by the amount
ot capital required to start the business) •
or upon a hundred other things.
A recipe for bacon-curing, suitable to this
climate? —826.
Y° cui " e 2001 b. pork take 3oz. saltpetre,
ooz black pepper, lOoz. dark brown sugar
and 2 quarts salt. Mix the saltpetre in a

night and morning with the brine that accu-

be ready to wash, hang up and smoke.

aeroplane? (lire particulars. —77o.
The record recognised by the International
Federation of Aeronautics is 40,809.7 ft.,
achieved by Callizo, a French pilot, in a
Rleriot-Spad machine with a 450-h.p. Lor-
raine engine at Rue. France, on August 23,
1926.
(.1) How docs one take out a patent?
(2) Could you recoin mend an agent? (3)
What, is the cost? —762.
(1) Rest to consult a reputable patent
attorney because the procedure, cost, etc.,
varies for different countries. (2) See advts.
in “Wild Cat” Column. They are all reput-
able. (3) Cost of obtaining letters patent
is based on the Government fees payable and
the work involved in preparing necessary
specifications and drawings. Cost of obtain-
ing provisional protection lasting nine months
is £5 55., and of letters patent for 16 years
from £23 to £2B. These amounts include
Government fees and attorney’s costs, and
apply to Australia only. An attorney would
quote for obtaining patents in foreign coun-
tries. The Institute of Patent Attorneys has
fixed the charges.
Am I justified in wearing a long-scrrice
medal from the N.S.W. Fire Brigade upon
my left breast with my war-service medals?
—B4B.
No. Civilian medals are worn on the right
side.
A receives a weekly wage, also a share in
the profits. His share of the profits for the
last half-year was £2O. Against what should
this £2O be charged and wh>>? —Bl9.
In a retail business wages are charged
against profit and loss. The net profit then
is usually transferred to appropriation ac-
count. The *2O would be charged against
appropriation and credited to A’s capital
account.
Gan you recommend a handbook which
would enable me to build a ; receiving set for
use in the back country, say, Riverina? —-861.
“Rroadcast Reception,” by J. L. Pritchard
(Bs. 6d. ) ; “The Boy’s Rook of Wireless”
(2s. 6d.) —both obtainable from Swain’s,
Ltd., 123 Pitt-street, Sydney. “The Daily
Telegraph Wireless Handbook” (Is. 6d.),
from Dymock’s, 428 George-street, Sydney.
(1) Would an increased demand for lime
for agricultural purposes result in appreci-
able decrease in price? (2) Average price
of agricultural lime at rail and at quarry
in Victoria? (3) Extent of limestone de-
posits in Victoria? —813.
(1) Can’t say. (2) The agricultural lime
quoted here is lime that has been burnt and
ground and left standing so that it is air-
slaked. This is quoted at 2s. 6d. a bag-
nett on rails. About 20 bags go to the ton.
Burnt: or builders’ lime is 6s. 3d. a bag.
(3) There are 23 limestone deposits in vari-
ous parts, most important being at Curdie’s
River, Coimadai, Dutson, Lilydale, Waratah
and Batesford. These have all been mined
extensively. Others at Kawarren, Mansfield
and Mitchell River have been worked in a
small way.
(1) What is the law of gravity? (2) Is
it constant? (3) Do objects of the same
size but different weights fall at the same
pace? (4) Is there any difference in the
power required to lift a certain weight from
the ground and to lift the same weight off
a platform sft. from the ground? A crane
lifted a (Scwt. bale of wool off a sft. plat-
form on to a icaggon without straining any
parts of the mechanism. The next day, in
lifting a s cwt. engine from the ground to the
platform, the mechanism ivas badly strained.
Why was this? —812.
(1) The acceleration due to gravity at
any place is the same for all bodies; that is,
all objects, if acted on only by the pull of
the earth, fall in exactly the same manner,
the downward velocity increasing each
second by the same constant amount in each
case (about 32 feet per second). (2) The
acceleration due to gravity is constant at
any place. But it has different values at dif-
ferent places on the earth’s surface, though
the variation is small. (3) No, because on
account of the air resistance we have a force
opposing the increase of velocity due to
gravity. This force is practically the same
for bodies of the same size and shape travel-
ling at the same speed, and is therefore
relatively more important in the case of the
light body than the heavy one, so that the
latter reaches the ground first. (4) No. A
possible explanation is this. The load is
initially at rest, but in a short time is given
an upward velocity; during this speeding up
the downward pull is greater than the dead
weight. If the speeding up were done more
quickly in the second ease the downward pull
might be greater than in the first case,
though the dead weight is actually less.
We have three paw-paw trees growing,
about 12 months old; one is bearing , the
other two arc not. The one bearing has 17
puw-paws on it. Why? How should we
handle them? —780.
The two non-bearing trees are probably
males. Watch the flowering. On the female
tree the inflorescence is at the leaf base
close to the stem; with the male the inflor-
escence is on what is generally known as
the panicle, carrying numerous small flowers.
Male trees are superfluous. When the fruit
is approaching maturity it colors yellow at
its apex. For local use let the fruit remain
on the tree until it is yellow throughout.
It will ripen if taken earlier, but the flavor
is then less pronounced. A simple method of
determining when the fruit is sufficiently
advanced for the full flavor to be developed
is to scratch through the outer skin. No
juice should exude. In earlier stages milky
exudation is always present and the fruit
is much less palatable.
We are N.'F.W. sharefarmors. How do ice
stand under the Workers’ Compensation
Act—in relation (1) to the landowner, (2)
to our men employees? The final clause of
our agreement reads: ‘‘The owner will pro-
tect his contractors by insuring them under
the Workers' Compensation Act, but the
said contractors hereby agree to insure their
employees and in the event of any claim
being made by the said employees the con-
tractors take full responsibility.” —Bs6.
(1) The landowners are responsible for
sharefarmers. (2) The sharefarmers (or
contractors, as they are called in the agree-
ment) are responsible for any employees
they engage.
Were the land-masses of the North and
South Heads of Sydney Harbor islands at
any time? —863.
The Professor of Geology at Sydney Uni-
versity states: “Roth North and South
Heads were formerly islands. At that time
the sea level stood about 15 feet higher than
it does to-day, and Sydney Harbor com-
municated with the ocean across Manly on
the north and from Rose Ray to Rondi on
the south.”
Where could I get expert information as
to the value of foreign notes (paper money)?
How should I go about selling them? —805.
If of recent issue Commonwealth Rank
or Thomas Cook and Son will buy them,
mostly at a discount. If old and rare, Lyster
Ormsby, 26 Hunter-street, Sydney, might
do so.
In the dialect of the tribes inhabiting the
Ifaranoa (Q.), what are the equivalents of
plenty water, good 'water, large waterhole;
also wilderness? —835.
The following may suit:—Trawalla=mueh
water, banoon sweet water, myuna=clear
water, eurobinMarge lagoon, bullen bullen-
lonely place.
(!) What are the duties of executors of
wills? (2) Should executors hold a copy? —
798.
(1) To bury tin; deceased in a manner
suitable to his estate; to prove bis will by
forwarding it under registered post to the
Registrar of Probates, who will supply the
forms to be filled in. In a, covering letter give
executor’s full name and address. After pro-
bate has been granted the executor must get
in the estate, pay funeral and testamentary
expenses and debts, and fhen proceed to carry
out the provisions of the will, and, when this
has been done, render, within 12 months, a
true account to the Registrar of Probates.
(2) It would be. judicious before sending on
the will for probate to make an exact copy
and have the copy attested —even registered
post may go astray. A copy of the will is,
however, attached to the grant of probate to
the executor. If the property disposed of is
of considerable value or the will raises any
doubt or difficulty, employ a solicitor, whose
fees are regulated by scale and paid out of
the estate.
Is there a way to eradicate deep-rooted
couch grass? If the land is rendered sterile,
so much the better. —647.
Liberally water with hot brine. The brine
should be as concentrated as possible. Several
applications may be necessary. Red oil is
also sometimes effective. Ordinary weed-
killing mixtures and arsenic and soda are
generally successful provided several applica-
tions are made. The second application
should be made as soon as the couch shows
signs of growing again.
What do the native words uloola and
wyndomel mean ? -759.
Uloola —the sun. Cannot trace the other.
Anybody know?
(1) Some nine months hack were the Fed-
eral Weather Bureau annual expenses cut
by £1000? (2) Why are weather reports
from Westralia now only irregularly pub-
lished in Sydney? —B2l.
(1) There has not been any reduction for
current work of the bureau. (2) Irregu-
larities have been due to the transfer of the
old overland telegraph-line to the trans-
continental line train route. When this is
finished irregularities should bo much less
frequent.
What books deal icith the productiveness
and possibilities of Australia? —831.
“Australian Encyclopaedia,” “Official Year
Rook,” “Australia: Economic and Political
Studies,” edited by Meredith Atkinson:
“Shipping and Commerce of Australia” (pub-
lished annually), “Labor and Industry in
Australia,” by T. A. Coghlan (4 vols.).
Get the “Official Year Rook” for a start.
Date when Halley's Comet last appeared:
and when is it due again? —Bls.
Discovered by Dr. Max Wolf at Heidel-
berg, Sept. 11. 1909. Look for it again in
about 75 years’ time.
• Does Anybody Know?
T ivould be pleased to post my Bulletin,
with occasional English and other papers, to
any out-back family who can assure me that
they do not already receive them and would
be glad of reading matter. I would rather
post direct each week than send to an organ-
isation or book club. Docs anybody know
such a family—or families? —818.
Information Supplied.
285. —To stop a gal. iron roof from sweat-
ing, paper the under side (newspaper will
do), using ordinary flour paste, made with
warm water. —J.11.P.
Brief Answers.
G.L.: An old English trade token, unsale-
able if in bad condition and worth no more than
a shilling or two if in good. .. .C.T.H.: A pretty wild
gamble. Nothing, however, against any of the
directors. .. .K.W.: See “Land” page... .N.G.: Quite
good. There’s a par. about it in the “Wild Cat”
Monthly for July; business is better, and the thing
seems definitely to have turned the corner... .1t.1'.F.:
Yes, £4 ss. was declared as a basic wage in N.S.W.
on October 8, 1920. But the basis was different;
separate child maintenance wasn’t provided for then.
.... J.M.C.: A later edition of a work published in
1671. Original edition when last auctioned brought
255. Your copy might bring anything from 10s. to
about £3. Try Foyle’s, 121-25 Charing Cross-road,
London, W.C. 2....A.M.E.: Society of Arts and
Crafts, 8 Rowe-street, Sydney... .M.S.: No. 2 may
make big profits; but we’re not sweet on either.
.... McG.: Can’t tell for certain on this rubbing,
but it is probably a brass imitation of a spade
guinea. They were circulated in thousands about 40
years ag0....E.G.: Last year over 80 p.c. of its
income went in exes. ; in the A.M.P. less than 10 p.c.
From that you will judge what your chances of
early bonuses are. And premiums less bonuses are
the cost price of insurance. For 1926 the A.M.P.’s
bonuses were 57 p.c. of premiums. Capital amply
protects your policy, nevertheless... .W.R.: Estimated
population of Canley Vale in 1917 was 500, and in
1927 it is 2000. The land on the western side of the
Main Southern Railway rises and is undulating; on
the ‘ other side, level. Soil, mostly red clay....
A.E.8.: Doubt whether it would be any use bringing
an action against the solicitor. Place all the facts
you can fully substantiate before the Incorporated
Law Society... .G.P.P.: If you mean an investment
in the shares, you would certainly have to wait many
years for any return. At present, though it is
accumulating liabilities under its policies, the pre-
miums are nowhere near paying the working expenses.
... .Martin B.: See last week’s “Wild Cat” Column....
J.H.T.: You’ll find it much easier to get in than
to get out... . W.H.W.: Hoifnungs, 165 Pitt-street,
Sydney... .E.D.: By that route, 838 miles... .E.H.W.:
Celotex Co., 7 Bridge-street, Sydney ... .P.W.F.:
Sydney gunmakers report that the Marble game-
getter is not very satisfactory for Australian con-
ditions, so they do not stock it. It could be
imported through Mick Simmons, Ltd., Sydney, at a
cost of about £6.... J.J.R.: E. J. Newton, 61
Market-street, Sydney... .S.N.: “Kunyong” appears
to be a variant of “Kooyong”=bandicoot. No mean-
ing can be found for “yong”... .S.E.M.: Shark
Island is a recreation reserve under the control of
the Government and is unoccupied... .Link: Is not
probability the other way—that the agent, if he
acted and promised as you state, exceeded his autho-
rity, wherefore the Association repudiated it ?....
0.D.5.: (1) Bad, and you’d better get out of it
while you can. (2) No, the costs are too high....
D.W.A.; That published comparison is worth nothing.
It is no doubt quite true that this co. has got more
business in five years than the A.M.P. in its first
five; but consider (1) the increase in population
since the A.M.P. started; (2) the popularisation of
insurance; (3) the fact that, anyhow, £1 of in-
surance isn’t worth half of what £1 was when the
A.M.P. started... .R.A.8.: The Bank of Western Aus.
had the smallest capital to start with, £2000; the
Bank of N. S. Wales had £3625. Dates—N.S.W.,
1817; W.A., 1841. .. .E.W.H.: “Pompon” is the
ornamental ball ; “pom-pom” the gun—the latter an
imitative word, the former from the French....

the utmost in elegance and distinction. To-day the word is
known to a vastly greater world as the name of a car of
distinguished quality. It still, too, and most appropriately,
implies supreme smartness, for no car on the roads to-day
rivals in individual beauty and grace of line the smart and

SPORTING
NOTIONS
Under the Whip
The crowd at Flemington on Saturday
saw two uncommonly good ’chasers battle
out the finish of the Grand National Steeple,
and the better horse at the weights won.
With heavy going certain, Clan Robert, Avho
had the steadier of 12st. 61b., eased in the
betting the night before, and on the course
as much as 7 to 1 was laid against last
year’s winner, Nyangay being first choice
at 5 to 1. But the money came in wads
for Norman Falkiner’s big brown, and when
McShortodds shut up his bag it wras 3 to 1
Clan Robert, 7 to 1 Namera and Nyangay,
S to 1 Epergne, 14 to 1 Lachlan, Batouch
and Derision, 16 to 1 Hannan, Gleutronie
and Welcome Stranger, 25 to 1 Miuterne,
and 33 to 1 and better the others —there were
17 starters.
It was a thrilling race. Batouch led over
the first fence and Gleutronie over the second.
Then Nyangay went to the front, and, tak-
ing the stand treble cleverly, he turned out
of the straight four lengths clear of Clan
Robert, Epergne being eight lengths behind
the ex-Sydneysider, with Batouch and Na-
mera nearest of the others; Gleutronie, Deri-
sion aud Mailman had fallen. Fencing
perfectly, as also Avas Clan Robert, Nyangay
continued in the lead, and at the back of
the course there were only two in it. Clan
Robert looked like running up to the leader
just before they took the last fence, and
great was the excitement; but the light-
weight turned into the straight with a clear
advantage. Though another challenge came
from the favorite, Avho ran a very gallant
race, Nyangay went away again, to win by
three lengths, Avith Namera, plugging on,
six lengths away, just half a length clear
of Epergne—had that half-length been the
other way about The Bulletin’s Melbourne
man would have had first, second and third.
Batouch, Lachlan, Hannan and Goldmaster
were the only others to finish. Nyangay,
Avho carried 9st. 111 b., is an aged gelding by
imported Varco out of a Grafton mare. He
is owned by J. F. Ryan, is trained by 11.
Myers, and was ridden a beautiful race by
Frank Leonard. But for the stroke of mis-
fortune Avhicli deprived George Leonard of
the mount on Coybeau the previous Satur-
day, the Leonard boys would have landed
the double, G. N. Hurdle and Steeple. Nyan-
gay’s time was Gmin. Moon, who
rode Clan Robert, considers that his mount
Avould have been a certainty in good going;
but, judging by the fact that Nyangay has
been given list, and Clan Robert 12st.
AT THE “SOCIETY” MEETING.
DAN: “Cripes, dad, heaps o' people waitin’ till the finish, ain't there?”
DAD: “I betcher there’ll be a lot of ’em not through the milkin’ by dark Ur-night."
111 b. in the Australian Steeple, the V.A.T.C.
handicapper does not share his opinion.
With Grosvenor scratched, Tildin, despite
his list. 131 b., was sent out a 7-to-2 favorite
for the Doutta Galla Hurdle, 21 miles, Coy-
beau being next in favor at 9 to 2 and
Telarno at 5 to 1. Neither the favorite nor
Telarno ever travelled like a winner, but
Coybeau, Avho had been put up 211 b. for his
National victory, ran a good race and proved
that the preA’ious Saturday’s affair was no
fluke. Nothing, however, had a chance with
the lightly-weighted Lady Rooka (8 to 1),
who, taking charge a mile from home, won,
running away, from Coybeau and Blarwyn
(15 to 1). This daughter of Narcisse —
Rooka, who is trained by Ron Cameron for
A. Crozier, has plenty of pace and is sure to
be heard of again. FVom 9st. 41b. on Satur-
day, she has gone up to lOst. in the Aus-
tralian Hurdle.
Deauville w r as once more the medium of
heavy betting, going out at 9 to 4 for the
Trial Hurdle. This time he pulled his back-
ers through, but it was only by a neck that
he beat Arcadius (7 to 2) ; Lanage (6 to
1) was a poor third. Strath Blith (12 to
1) had a long lead at one stage of the
Footseray Steeple, for Avhicli Sir Myst Avas
faA’oritc at 5 to 2, but lie tired badly in the
straight, where Valaster (10 to 1) ran away
from him, Ancient Mariner (11 to 2) and
Talplia (10 to 1) also beating Strath Blith
over the last bit. Inkson rode a dashing
race on Valaster, whose sire Avas the neg-
lected Piastre.
Eric Connolly went for a good win on
his imported gelding Herilda in the Lawn
Handicap, just as he did on the last day
of the A.J.C. Easter meeting, and it came
off, as it did then. The public followed
the lead, and 3 to 1 was the starting price,
but Connolly did much better. In an in-
teresting finish Herilda had half a length to
spare from Nepean (6 to 1), Switzerland
(8 to 1) being only a head away. Herilda
is no champion, but Connolly has found him
useful.....
There was a great tussle in the July Han-
dicap, the last race of the meeting, between
Manacre (8 to 1), an unsuccessful visitor
to Sydney at Easter, and Altimeter (7 to
1), Manacre getting the better of it by a
long head; Homerus (7 to 1) was third.
E. M. Pearce, who owns Manacre, and his
trainer, A. Mortimer, have not had much
luck recently, and the change was welcome.
It took them lmin. 451 sec. to run the mile,
which shows what the going was like.
# * * =!••
There was hooting at Roselull on Saturday
week when The Thorn won the Rosehill
Handicap; there was cheering at Moorefield
on Saturday after the same horse’s success
in the Moorefield Handicap. McCarten, the
jockey, must wonder what Sydney crowds
are made of. The Maoriland gelding and
Gladshot were co-favorites, at 9 to 2, for
the race on the Kogarah course, and the
victory was accomplished rather comfort-
ably, although the owners of St. Eaton (5
to 1), the second horse, considered that he
had been interfered with, and wanted to
enter a protest when it was too late; Hinch-
inbrook (5 to 1) was a fair third. David-
son's horsemanship had a lot to do with
Golden Grist’s defeat of Reference (7 to 2)
in the Flying Handicap, for which his mount
Avent out at 5 to 1; but he failed to induce
the uncertain Release (6 to 1) to do better
than fourth in the mile handicap for three-
and four-year-olds, Prince Colugo (8 to I )
winning after a spirited struggle with Stoney-
kirk (7 to 1) and Avrom (10 to 1). Avrom,
who gets plenty of racing and thrives on it,
was brought out again for the Carlton Mile,
being 7tol in a field of seven. He got away
poorly, but reached his field going up the
hill (they went up very slowly) and had a
nice lead 100 yards from home. But just
Avhen his jockey thought he had the race in
hand, old Woodville (7 to 1) ranged along-
side, and Avrora was beaten by a neck. The
ancient was ridden from behind for once.
The £lOOO Winter Cup at Rosebery
(N.S.W.) Avas run in divisions, and Albert
Callinan, the crack pony jockey, had the
novel experience of riding three of the four
winners thereof. His mounts were Wingen
(7 to 2), Merton (4 to 1) and Bosli (5 to
1), all rejects from A.J.C. courses. Callinan
rode Wingen in the run-off, that beautifully-
bred fellow being equal favorite, at 5 to 4,
with Merton, who had 11. Griffiths for pilot;
but humping 10st. 41b. tAvice in an afternoon
proved too much for Wingen, who was beaten
into third place by Merton and Halyard,
the six furlongs less 38 yards being run
in lniin. 13sec. Merton is a thi-ee-year-old by
Greenstead—Dorrie Merton. Green stead has
sired a power of winners during his brief
stud career, but it doesn’t seem to make him
any more popular Avith owners of inares
and buyers of yearlings, so great is the pre-
judice against Australian-bred sires.

“Oilskin”: Increasing weight has pushed
the younger W. H. McLachlan out of the
jockey game. His dad, who rode the Mel-
bourne Cup winners Prince Foote and Com-
edy King, took him to England in 1923 and
apprenticed him to E. de Mestre, formerly
of these parts. In his first season young
Mac scored 8 firsts, 3 seconds and 10 thirds
out of 83 rides; in his second season he
Avas up 445 times for 59 wins, 35 seconds
and 35 thirds; in 1925 he had 348 mounts
for 32 firsts, 30 seconds and 44 thirds. Re-
turning to Australia with the old man (who
is not so very old), he put on weight so
fast that it was soon clear that he would
have to give the game best. The youngster’s
last ride in Melbourne was appropriate; it
Avas on Red Gauntlet in the V.R.C. Farewell
Handicap last March.
Footbrawl
Another reputation for invincibility
crashed on Saturday, when Sydney Rugby
League resumed its club competitions after
bringing down the Queenslanders from their
pedestal in the inter-State matches. South
Sydney, unconquered for a season and a
half, was beaten by Eastern Suburbs, which
scored 17 to 16. East made the most of
its chances in the first half, when it led
12-8; and doggedly kept its head above water
during South’s desperate attempts to break
through in the second half. With the scores
at 17 to 11 East closed up the game, and
though Wearing came with a characteristic
try, which Blair converted, it Avas too late.
South crossed the line four times, as against
three tries by East, but Oxford’s four goals,
one a beauty, turned the scale in favor of
the Tricolors, for Avliom Hardy played a
rare game at centre. Glebe likewise realised
the value of an accurate goal-kicker when
Hickey’s four goals brought it home by
a whisker from Balmain, 11-10. Bals. got
two tries to one, but the kicks counted at
the finish. University, Avhicli piously de-
clined to play its star, O’Rourke, because
he has “turned professional,” was easily
beaten by St. George, 17-7; North Sydney,
which is battling for the wooden spoon with
Uni., improved its position by heading New-
town, 5-2.
* * * *
“Gate”: There is a tinge of irony in the
fact that a member of the University Rugby
League team, A. F. O’Rourke, should be
the first Sydney player to succumb to the
cash baits being dangled before Australians
by the English League, for the Uni. club's
devotion to amateurism has been proclaimed
many a time and oft. O’Rourke has signed
on for three years for a retainer of £BOO,
so much a match and a job as school-
teacher. As ho may be called on to play
as many as three matches a week, he won't
have much time for school-teaching——in the
football season, at all events.
“Gwy”: Should the Garry-Tully contest
occur at Goulburn when the N.S.W. politi-
cians clash (B. 80/6/’27), it will be a case
of one old-time Rugby footballer against
another. Jack Garry, a quarter of a century
ago, was a star in Sydney ’Varsity forwards.
He usually caught the eye in leaping for
the ball on the ]ine-out in the strenuous
struggles with Lew Abrams’s Red boys from
the Glebe. Jack was studying mining engin-
eering in those days, but 1 doubt if he took
ore bodies and crucibles seriously, either
then or later, as lie settled down to a spell
of station life, broken by the war. Jack
Tully, some 40 years later, was looked on
by some judges as the best half-back in
(Continued on page J/1.)
WATTLE BLOSSOM’S RACE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“The Queensland Billygoat Derby, for a prize
donated by Madame Melba, was run the other day.’ -
V’ arsk me w’y I sit ’ere, sir, smokin’ me
pipe at ease,
Watchiu’ th’ missus waskin’ an’ th’ poodle
catchin’ fleas?
Well, thanks, don’t mind if I do, sir; it
rests me t’ get awray:
Th’ sight of tli’ missus Avorkin’ is turnin’
me old ’air grey.
Y’ see, I wuz on’y fourteen, sir, and tli’
missus wuz on’y ten,
W’en we ’ooked up with each other —it's
queer to look back on then;
But crool ole people intruded an’ bunged
our golden ’opes:
Th’ missus wuz goin’ to school, sir, an’ I
wuz at work in tli’ stopes.
Them wuz th’ roaring days, sir, when things
on th’ Towers wuz good,
W’en th’ mugs wuz round in millions, an’
th’ shrewdies on velvet stood;
Them wuz the days I turned me thoughts to
th’ odoriferous goats.
We ’ad ’em there by th’ thousand. Says I:
“They must earn their oats.”
Tli’ toffs ’ad their racin’ ’orses, but that
wasn’t sport enough
To ease th’ minds o’ th’ talent as wuz tired
o’ Stock Exchange guff.
’Endin’ ’em, cards, Murrumbidgee—they wuz
sick uv it all.
That wuz th’ time it come ter me ter give
th’ goats a stall.
We started th’ first goat meetin’ on the
square at Richmond ’lll.
W’at we did ter “Stepper” Davis th’
Towers ’ll tell y’ still.
But tli’ day uv days fer our fantbly—it
makes me nervy yet—
Wuz tli' day I backed Wattle Blossom ter
land us our weddin’ bet.
A grand ole billy wuz Blossom,’ an’ trained
ter th’ nines, I’ll say,
Till ’e wuz that aromatic y’d smell ’im
a mile away.
An’ just before we did th’ prelim., tli’ girlie
clutched at me wing,
An’ says, “If ’e wins—no vi’lets; jist bring
me th’ dear old thing.”
I ’ad ter steer ’im meself, sir, ’e knew me
voice an’ me ’and.
I’ll never fergit th’ first time roun’ w’en we
swung be th’ members’ stand,
An’ I ’eard ’er fairy treble float down to me
through th’ air:
“Stick to it, Wattle Blossom! Ain’t they a
beautiful pair?”
Th’ pace told well in th’ second, an’ I led
’em inter th’ straight.
“ ’Ow are they cornin’ be’ind,” says I, but
couldn’t look back and wait.
Then I got a w’iff at me elber, and went as
I never went,
’Avin’ jerried a goat from Townsville wuz
’ot on ole Blossom’s scent.
We battled it all out some’ow —I dunno
reely now
’Ow th’ Pride uv the good ole Towers out-
footed that Townsville coav.
But this I’ll alwuz remember, mid the cheer-
in’s organ swell,
Th’ Judge’s verdick: “Th’ Towers, The
Towers be a bloomin’ smell.”
An’ Wattle Blossom? Don’t worry, ’e’s
dozin’ th’ years away;
Kep’ in every comfort fer th’ sake uv that
bonzer day.
Y’ see I’m an aldeiraian now, sir, an’ c’n
let me fancies rip,
An' good ole Wattle, ’e as th’ run aiv th’

Motor-owners who once used ordinary oils and then
switched over to Castrol tell us they used to contend with
many lubrication troubles and other difficulties which do not
seem to arise from faulty lubrication, but disappear when
Castrol is put into the sump.
Owners and drivers are realising that the quality of the
lubricant is of the utmost importance to the well-being of the
mechanical system—
That the lifetime of the engine lubricated with the right
grade of “Castrol” is longer than that of one lubricated with
an ordinary oil, and—
That “Castrol” retains its viscosity under the hardest
conditions of temperature, strain and load and, incidentally,
goes much farther.

Western Suburbs, but the Prentice influence
was strong in the club and a member of the
family secured the position. Probably- this
had something to do with Tully leaving the
Union game for the League.
* * * *
In the Union competition there _ was a
fierce battle between Glebe-Balmain and
Western Suburbs. G.-B. won, 19-18, though
three of the regular three-quarter line, in-
eluding Wallace, were absent. Western Sub-
urbs had a lead of 18 to 8 in the second
spell, but the Glebe forwards, finely led by
Ford, beat down the opposition, Fraser and
Breckenridge backing him in great style; S.
King, the Waratah centre, played a rattling
game in West’s three-quarter line. Eastern
Suburbs surprised by dishing Manly, 19-3;
the Eastern backs showed up well, especially
T. Egan at five-eighth and O’Sullivan, a new
centre. University made hay of Rand wick,
winning 33-9; Mann and Bowers, the Wara-
tah wingers, gave fine displays, the Uni.
youngster scoring three tries. Y.M.C.A.,
with three tries to a try and two penalty
goals, drew with North Sydney.

The Soccer club games were held up for
the first Test between Australia and China
at Sydney Showground. The local men won
bv 6 goals to 1, an unexpected score, for the
Chinese had beaten a strong Metropolitan
side earlier in the week. The Australians
were made up of N.S.W. and Queensland
players; the visitors were on equal terms
with them all the first half, but the Aussios
shook off the opposition in the second spell,
playing much improved football throughout.
The forward line did particularly well. The
best of the Chinese were Chan, the outside
left, and Lee and Lai, the backs. The only
weakness displayed by the visitors is an in-
ability to stay the distance. They play fast,
clever and clean football, but their lighter
poundage is against them.
* * * *
“Feng Shoot”: Australia, which has now
received two visits from Chinese Soccer,
teams, is to be repaid in kind. _ Last week
the managers of the Chinese side now in
N. S. Wales announced that they intended
to invite an Australian team to China next
season. Hongkong and Shanghai have fine
grounds, while British teams, as well as
Chinese, are available for matches. Even
the A.l.F.’s old friends the “Pork-and-
Clieese” play Soccer at Macao, close to Hong-
kong, so there should be no lack of variety
in the opposition. But it is the ambition
of the Commonwealth Soccer authorities to
staid an Australian team to the Olympiad,
and two trips can hardly be undertaken in
Ihe same season.

Saturday’s Melbourne League ’ball pro-
vided two glittering games and some duds.
One of the former was staged at Geelong,
where the local side staved off South Mel-
bourne’s fierce finish with but a goal to
spare. No affection is wasted between these
teams, so the game was willing, minor casu-
alties being many. Scores: Geelong, 72
points; South, 60. With that defeat
went the last of South’s hopes of reaching
the finals. Collingwood and Melbourne met
at the Melbourne C.G., and the Red Legs,
finding their feet auickest, collected 26 points
to ’Wood’s 7in the first quarter. After that
the play grew solid; the Red Legs were
smarter to the ball but when the Magpies
did get it they found their men with marvel-
lous accuracy. At half-time they were five
points ahead; at three-quarter time, 18
points. The last term saw Melbourne striv-
ing strenuously, but the Magpie backs held
them up sufficiently to have 7 points in hand
at the bell—79 to Melbourne’s 72. A hard,
strong game; but clean. Richmond downed
Fitzroy with 111 points to 55, the loss of
Gordon, with a broken leg, contributing to
'Roy’s disaster; and Carlton trounced St.
Kilda, 135 to 44, in a game which was more
farce than football. Footscray licked North
Melbourne by 100 points to 72; and Essen-
don thrashed Hawthorn by 78 to 71, though
only the latter’s rotten kicking permitted it.
During the week the League’s tribunal dis-
qualified a pugilistic ’Don for eight weeks,
and a P.M. spoke harshly to a youth caught
throwing clinkers at the umpire at Carlton.
The beak was in two minds whether to hand
him something without the option, but finally
eased him down with a fine of £lO, plus
costs. Also a Northcote barraeker who had
jumped the fence and hopped into the goal
umpire was separated from a fiver.
The full strength of the case in which
Maryborough is playing Colin Watson in de-
fiance of the V.F.L., which has accordingly
disqualified Maryborough and the Ballarat
League, was disclosed when the Ballarat
League met to consider counsel’s opinion on
the matter. This was distinctly adverse to
Ballarat, Maryborough and Watson, but. on
being invited to eat humble pie, one dele-
gate said it couldn’t be done because Mary-
borough had paid Watson £250 in advance.
So the strained relations continue.
M.Q. (and Rafferty) Rules
Though beaten and battered, worn and
weary, Mike O’Connor, announced as “cham-
pion middleweight of Canada,” refused to
admit that Merv Williams was his master
at the Sydney Stadium on Saturday night,
and stayed in a hopeless cause to the last
punch of the last (loth) round. The Can-
adian is too short in the limbs ever to be a
Queensberry champion ; but he has the game-
ness of a bulldog. He fights in the butt-in-
and-swing-both-fists fashion, and Williams,
sizing him up like the scientist he is, started
to use the left jab that made such a mess of
Charlie Long. As the left jab steadied the
rush (Mike had no stop for it but his nose)
Williams would send a bitter right to body
or head, uppercut under the chin or into the
stooped dial, slide out of danger and come
back instantly with an encore. Not only was
the Australian too fast and clever, but he
had an advantage in reach. Full of fight, and
evidently as tough as a belali log. O’Connor
plunged in continuously, only to bump into
one or both of Williams’s gloves and be sent
staggering in his tracks. He tottered to his
chair after the ninth round, and Referee
Wallis humanely suggested that he’d had
enough, but he repudiated the suggestion
with scorn, reasoning that while he could
stand he had a chance. Like his kind, the
plucky visitor has a strong predilection for
the kidney and rabbiter punches, and these
were practically all the blows he landed.

THE INFLUENCE OF GOLF.
Our leading local amateur knocks up the morning wood.
or. three years ago. Still, he is doing a lot
better than most champions did in “the good
old days.” Take the case of Martin Power,
a useful lightweight of the White Horse
period. Power came to Sydney from Queens-
land to try for a match with Jim Burge or
Jack Fuller. Larry Foley was agreeable,
and a scrap between Martin and Ironbark
.Jim was duly billed on the loose board out-
side the White Horse pub, in George-street,
which was Larry’s most dazzling advertising
scheme. Power was broke, but being unusu-
ally modest and reticent he did not mention
it, even to Foley. Instead, he sat on a
seat in Hyde Park nearly all the day before
the fight, actually starving. I saw him there
twice but thought he was merely resting
after roadwork. He fought a terrific 12
rounds with Burge, and collapsed from sheer
weakness. Then lie told me the story of his
enforced fast. He hadn't had a meal for
three days!

“Mitt”: Peter Jackson’s reputation for
being the most modest of pugs is in no
danger from Sharke'y, who is about to
clash with Jack Dempsey. “Take it from
me,” Sharkey told an interviewer the other
day, “I’m de bes’ pug in de woild.” One
recalls that John L. Sullivan made the same
boast on that famous Australian visit. “Not
in the world, John,” someone ventured to
interject, having Jackson in mind —“in
America, certainly.” “Well,” hiccupped the
champeen as he signalled for another bottle,
“ain’ dat de same t’ing?”

111 b.) at Melbourne Stadium, and although
no title was involved, the crowd was enor-
mous. The Yorkshireman dispelled doubts as
to his condition by maintaining a fast pace
throughout the first round, at the close of
which he had the American in a dangerous-
looking toehold. Unfortunately for himself,
the Oregon man’s top-piece is ideally shaped
for headlocks, and Sam put them on at every
opportunity. Ted made the pace in the third
round, and in a llurry of speedy wrestling
tossed Sam around like a bag of straw ; once,
with a scissors and arm bar, he had the
Yorkshireman in difficulties, but Samuel s
uncommon strength saved the situation for
him Thye kept up the pace in the fourth,
and a toehold, followed by a “splits” and a
hammerlock, tried the Briton so severely that
the gong must have sounded like fairy-bells
to him. Sam retaliated in the next round
with toeholds and Ins favorite body scissors,
and when lie connected with his crotch hold
a murmur went up; but Ted frustrated the
customary dump with a clever twist. Hence-
forward it was a Dattlo of toeholds. Neither
gained a fall, but Thye was given a points
decision, which Old England took very badly.
The Nineteenth Hole
Tommy Howard, of Concord (N.S.W.)
club, won the Queensland open championship
at Brisbane last week from a very strong
field. J. N. Rad-
eliffe, Queensland
amateur champion,
was second, and
Victor .1 ames, an-
other N.S.W. pro.,
was third. Howard’s
total for the four
18-hole rounds was
286: 70, 74, 70, 72,
a miracle of con-
sistency. He was
five strokes up on
Radcliffe and eight
on James. H. R.
Sinclair, who was
fifth at the end of
the first two
rounds, was dis-
qualified for teeing
a dropped ball, an
error against which
a player of his ex-
perience should
have been proof.
The best round was
68, done by James
in the third.
Howard began as
an amateur with
the Bonnie Doon
(N.S.W.) club-
lie was then a rail-
way employee. He
won the club cham-
pionship in 1913,
T 5, TO, T 7, TB,
TO and ’2l;, and li;
wasam a t e u r
champ, of N.S.W.
in T 9 and ’2l, and
runner-up in ’2O
He won the Aus-
tralian open as a
pro. in ’23, and was
second in ’25: he
was professional
champion in ’24-
’25 an d ’25-’26.
To m m y’s fi rs t
Queensland victory
was the amateur championship of ’l9.
“Sherwood” : The tussle for the Yeerong-
pilly Cup, an open stroke handicap for
amateurs and professionals which ushered in
tin' Queensland golf championships, was won
by Stanley Francis, a local amateur, whose
minus 8 handicap left him with a net score
of 146. The highest pro. on the list was C.
Brown, of the Goodua club, on the plus 4
mark. H. R. Sinclair, who had the stagger-
ing handicap of plus 8, went the four rounds
in 142, doing the second 36 holes in 65 —32
out and 33 in. That beat the course record
by two strokes. Bogey is 75!
❖ ❖ *
“Divot Digger”: The outbreak of holing
out in one seems to be increasing in severity.
The other day Graham Smith, of the Cnl-
cairn (N.S.W.) club, did the trick twice
in one week, at Culcairn and Holbrook.
It is on record that one Duthie took two
successive holes in one at Vancouver (8.C.)
in 1911. History is silent as to what hap-
pened thereafter, but one can easily imagine
a player with a name like that deciding to
give up golf from motives of economy.
“N.H.”: Where was Australia’s first golf
club formed? Back files of Adelaide dailies
record that Sir William Fergusson and the
Hon. David Murray formed a club in Adel-
aide in 1869, and laid out links where the
Victoria Park racecourse is now. An old
carpenter who caddied on this course when
lie was a schoolboy tells me that the club
didn’t prosper. Stray cows seemed to de-
light in walking around on the greens, the
sticks would not stand the climate, and it
took nearly six months to replace them
from Scotland. This club _ passed out of
existence about 1875. Adelaide’s oldest golf-
course is the present municipal links on
Montefiore llill. nine holes of which were
laid down about 1890.

“Fitzcray”: .The Vic. golf championship
will commence on Saturday, August 18, and
last for a week. There will be the customary
two rounds of stroke play, with the final
eight in these entering on the 86-hole
matches. A. W. Jackson, last year’s State
champion, achieved the unusual when lie
headed the medal scores and then beat Alec
Russell in the match final. Many gowfers
consider that stroke preliminaries to cham-
pionships are unfair, since one bad shot may
put a player out of the matcli rounds; but
the truth is that medal play calls for the
two prime essentials in good golf, steadiness
and accuracy. No one can afford to make a
mistake or grow careless. In match play
the urge to perfect accuracy is not nearly so
severe. A man may throw away a hole or
two by sheer bad play and yet win.
Car and Cycle
“Rainbow” : The latest stunt in road engi-
neering in England and America is a colored
road. America began it with red concreted
surfaces, but these have proved trying to the
eyes. Britain has come along with a deli-
cate pink and is considering bright green.
Bail visibility on wet roads, especially with
strong headlights, lies behind the experi-
ments. A color is sought which will give the
minimum of dazzle with the maximum of
visibility. Color absorption of light rays
will, it is contended, solve the problem.
* * * *
“Toddy”: Australia will shortly see its
first instalment of the six-wheeled motor
vehicle which has been intriguing European
and American designers; a dozen four-ton
six-wheel “Karrier” trucks are being im-
ported for bulk distribution of C.O.R. oil. Six
will ply in Sydney, one at Newcastle, two
in Brisbane and Adelaide and one in Mel-
bourne. Advantages claimed for the six-
wheeler over the four-wheeled article are that
the weight is more evenly distributed and
the truck is “steadier on its feet" in slippery
going, while the six wheels lessen the ratio
of loss of engine-power in transmission. Also,
that it is less severe on road surfaces than
the four-wheeler.

“Chevroford” : A novel reliability trial has
been indulged in all on its own by a Rugby
car in Melbourne. It was sent on a non-
stop run for seven days and nights about the
city and environs. If it stalled once during
the period the test was to be called off. The
car became disastrously familiar to the.
traffic-cops, and the early-morning echoes of
many a country village were wakened by its
horn. The week happened to be the frostiest
in living memory, arid a pressman who took
the place of the observer for one night never
asked for a repetition. The car ambled
3526 miles, doing 32.68 miles to the gallon,
and ended without a spot upon its reputa-
tion. “Idling” at intersections and while
refilling and changing drivers occupied eight
hours.

“Cyclos” : The Dunlop Co. is proposing a
race for professional cyclists from Sydney to
Melbourne. Its idea is to spread the thing
over five days, with a day’s spell after each
stage, Gonlburn being the first stop, Albnry
the second, and then on to Melbourne. The
field will be limited to 100. all starting off
scratch, but. graded into two divisions, with
a “sealed” handicap to encourage the lesser
lights to complete the 565 miles.
speedway is shortly to be commenced near
Rio Janeiro. Brazil. The circumference of
the track will be 10 kilometres and will
enclose a zig-zag road-course of 20 kilo-
metres, with a macadamised surface. The
racing-track proper will be heavily concreted,
and owing to the size of the ring there will
be no need of heavy banking, since there
are no appreciable turns. On paper, at any
rate, the Brazilian departure appears a con-
siderable advance on the short-lap saucer-
tracks which arc dignified with the name
of motor speedways in Australia.

“Rolls-Liz”: Last year’s imports from
Britain show 1527 complete touring cars,
valued at £420,463; 204 commercial motor
vehicles, worth £118,390; 13.765 chassis,
with a total value of £2,319,430, and
£316.781 worth of parts—a tidy total of
£3.175,064 for Bull's stocking.

The Bisque": England, which “taught
the world the game," as an agonised British
.lournal puts it, finished with the also-rans
at \\ imbledon. The best British effort was
j a f °f Mi 1 , and Mrs. Godfree in the mixed
doubles and then the interesting couple
were whopped by the Americans, Hunter and
Elizabeth Ryan, in the final. The S’Africans
Mrs. Peacock and Miss Heine likewise
reached the final of the women’s doubles,
only, to go down before Helen Wills and
Lizzie Ryan abovementioned. Even the All-
England Plate, a sort of consolation singles,
was won by a second-rate French player in
Gentien.

'Cut Shot : Suzanne Lenglen made her
first London appearance as a professional
at Holland Park, and, with prices dropped
to 14s. 6d. and ss. 9d., drew a crowd of
about 4000. Suzanne beat Fraulein Koer-
nig. of Germany, 6-3. 6-0, in a singles match,
and then gave a half-hour's turn in mixed
doubles. The lady got £3OO for a total of
an hour's work. Averaging the gate at Ills,
a head, that left £l7OO for the other players
and for all “overhead" and profit, which
doesn t seem exactly a gold mine. Baldwin,
the Lenglen’s new manager, is threatening
to tour Japan and Australia in 1928 with
a team of pros, headed by Sue. Hi* is confi-
dent that the N.S.W. tennis authorities will
permit exhibition matches between his stable
and local amateurs, and, in view of past
happenings, he may be right. But if he
thinks that Australian tennis admirers are
going to part up 14s. Od. to set* his circus,
be had better think again. Their enthusiasm
doesn’t run to extremes like that, ns the
White City management will testify.
“Cash Amateur”: Suzanne Lenglen's
statement that a descenl on Australia is
being planned for her has led to a revival
of the question whether amateur and pro-
fessional should meet in competition. The
easiest way out of the difficulty would be
the institution of “open” events on the lines
of those which are such a feature in golf.
In these, amateur and professional compete
against each other, monetary rewards being-
set aside for successful pros, and all the
glory that is going, plus a cup or some other
trophy, for the amateurs. Not every game
lends itself to such a solution of an ever-
recurring and wearisome controversy, but
lawn-tennis, like golf, certainly does. There
is precedent, too, for in tennis proper, where
the lin(> of demarcation between the amateur
and professional is rigidly drawn, both are
permitted to meet in matches'.
"Footfault” : France has adv anced another
step towards the capture of the Davis Cup by
disposing of South Africa. Condon made a
good showing against Cochet, running the
Wimbledon winner to four sets; 6-0, 9-11,
6-2, 7-5. Borotra beat Raymond in straight
sets, while Brugnon and Borotra had to go
their best in the doubles, winning 7-5. 6-4.
8-6. The Afrikanders’ pluck in having a
shy at tin* stiff opposition is in contrast to
the “What’s-the-use?” attitude of the Aus-
tralian authorities.
“Limelight” : The question of professional
tennis is giving the leading women players
overseas plenty of limelight, at least. Betty
Nuthall's guardians having, after protracted
negotiations, spurned the golden lure, Helen
Wills has come along to say that she’d
“rather be a pauper than a professional.”
It sounds a bit like a feminine backhander at
friend Suzanne, but Helen seems to have
grasped the root of the matter when she says
she cannot see how anyone can play a game
in the right spirit with cash considerations
attaching to the result, or words to that
effect. If the statement does not draw a
blistering and characteristic reply from the
Lenglen a lot of third parties will be dis-
appointed.
Miscellaneous
The hockey girls from England made a
good impression in their first match in Syd-
ney on Saturday, when they beat N.S.W. by
9 goals to nil. The attendance was offi-
cially stated as 4000, and it would have been
more had hockey players of the other sex
not unchivalrously insisted on holding their
club matches as usual. As a spectacle the
game was well worth the price of admission,
the rattling pace maintained and the con-
dition of both sides coining as a surprise
to unaccustomed spectators. The visitors
showed remarkable control and stickwork
after settling down, and their combination
excels anything seen in Sydney since the
visit of the Indian hockey team.
“Rafferty” : I done in a Scotchman Satter-
dee. t' see tli’ shielahs playin’ ’ockey at th’
Sports Ground. ’Avin.bin a family man, I
wuz expectin’ a bit uv ’air-pullin’—they’re
gettin’ like a Sunday-school mob in th’

But. spare me days, things looked good on’y
wunst. One of th’ mob gives another tli’
Ilyin' trip, an' she 'its the dirt with 'er
dial. "Now, f'r it," sez I—but not on y'r
life. Th' tabby that took the toss gets up
an’ makes no show uv swingin' one. The

one a bit ’otter, an’ orders a free. It wuz

“Tenth Slip" : The Maoriland Cricket Coun-
cil has been throwing out feelers with a view
to getting the M.C.C. team due in Australia
next year to cross the Tasman for at least
a couple of matches. The Australian Board
of Control would, no doubt, like to oblige,
even though the Maorilanders have made the
tactical error of opening negotiations at the
wrong end. But time will be tin* difficulty.
With four States playing a full Sheffield
Shield programme, the next English tour
will have to synchronise with its schedule to
a tick. The proposed ALL. visit would take
at least throe weeks of precious time, and
where that is to be saved in the Australian
four is impossible to see. Maori land's best,
hope will be to arrange with the Alarylebone
and the Board of Control for the Englishmen
to return home by the trans-Pacific route.
“Shrewsbury”': The process, mechanical
nowadays, of piling up cricket records goes
wearily on. In the English North r. South
Test trial Holmes and Sutcliffe, of Yorkshire,
(hade 269 for the first-wicket partnership in
North’s only innings and were both n.o. It
was their 41st three-figure partnership for
the first wicket, so the I lobbs-Ha.vwafd
"record” of 40 is no more. Very intriguing
to the statisticians, no doubt, but the average
cricketer will take greater pleasure in read-
ing that left-hamler Percy Chapman, playing
for South, smacked up 70 out of 92 in 55
minutes.
* * * *
"Fenner’s”: Dhulcepsinghi, "Ranji’s"
nephew, who promised to follow in Uncle's
footsteps as a batsman, dropped oul of
cricket after opening the English season
with a brilliant 254 for Cambridge against
Aliddlesex. When he made the big score In'
was swathed in sweaters. Pleurisy followed,
and the young man had a narrow squeak.
The happening recalls “Ranji’s” somewhat
similar experience when he was in Australia
with Stoddart’s 1897-98 side. 11l in bed with
quinsy, he insisted on turning out for the
first match against Australia in Sydney, and
scored 175 his highest total in Test matches.
“Shrewsbury": English cricket averages up
to the end of .Tune do not include Hobbs or
Sutcliffe in the first 10 batsmen. Hobbs was
ordered by his doctor to drop cricket some
weeks ago, but the comparative failure of
Sutcliffe is a surprise, for wickets favored
the batsmen on the whole. Hallows, of Lan-
cashire, lfeads the list with an average of St;
for 22 innings and a highest score of 233.
Mead, of Hampshire, follows with 84 for 22
knocks. Hammond, the young Gloucester-
shire star, who played the highest number of

innings (27), has the highest aggregate
(1857) and is third in the averages with
74. Of those here with Gilligan, Sandham
and Hendren, with 61 each, are lying fifth,
and Ilearne is tenth, with 554. “Leg-
theory" Root, of Worcestershire, has taken
83 wickets for 15.77 and fast-howler Larwood
bagged 75 for 17.17 —good figures for a speed
merchant. R. Tyldesley, who had a record
of no wickets for 136 runs in the 1924-25
Tests and a bowling average of 42.36 for all
matches, is second on the English list with
62 wickets at 16.54.

"The Gaffer”: Still another ped. is re-
ported to have run 100 yards in 9 3-ssec. In
America, of course; the runner. C. Bonih, is
the fifth on that side of the water to claim
the distinction. It has been remarked that
few of these flyers in Yankeeland can get
anywhere near their home-town times when
they run in foreign parts. Perhaps the
watches are fixed on Honest Ned’s principle.
Ned. who had been a watchmaker before he
took to looking for “mugs" to back his string

of pods.,, owned a Hash split-second chrono-
meter that he'd fitted with an under-tlie-
lap brake attachment. When this was . set,
the gadget would make 100 in 11 look like
evens, and so on. Ned used to let liis
“mug" hold it in the trial spins, and one
lad or other would get faster every day.
When he’d cut out the 100 in 91 or so, Ned
would advise that the time was come to
break the Ring. Then the “mug” would rush
the money on at handsome prices, and the
race would be run. After (hat was over,
Ned would cut 50-50 with tin* Ikes and go
looking for a new “mug.”
"Bamboo”: This year’s battle for the
Dudley Cup, the big N.S.W. annual polo
event, will open at Kensington (N.S.W.)
on Saturday, July 23. The games will be
played in six ehukkas instead of the usual
four; this will not only benefit the ponies
but permit the use of fewer of them for a
game. An ominous item on the programme
is the inclusion of “ladies’ riding classes”
for polo ponies owned by members of clubs
affiliated with the N.S.W. Polo Association.
Polo is one of the. few games which the Sex
has not invaded. Seemingly the immunity
is coming to an end.
“Ride Off" : Sporting America is showing
keen interest in tin* first batch of Australian
polo ponies to reach the Dry Republic. There
arc 16 of them; they arc part of the string to
be ridden by the team of Indian Army
officers who will represent Britain in the
game with the U.S.A. for the Westchester
Cup. The Australian polo pony is becoming
as famous in India as the “waler" once was
as a charger and saddle horse. American polo
people are particularly struck with the
cleverness and “good manners’* of the new
arrivals, and as they don’t care a hang what
they pay for a good pony there seems a
chance of building up a trade in the little
fellows.
“llotham": This year’s llenley-on-the-
Yarra will be particularly attractive. Maori-
land is sending over a sculler, as well as a
four for the Stewards’ Challenge Cup. Too-
woug, a Brisbane club, and Rockhampton,
where the Billygoat Derby is run, have pro-
mised fours for the same event; and Mos-
rnan. the N.S.W. champion eight, will have a
shy at the Grand Challenge . Cup. It is so
rarely that a crew from the aloof N.S.W.
Rowing Association is seen at Henley that
Mosman's entry has caused a mild sensation,
and the Melbourne club, which holds the
trophy, has hastened to get its crew afloat,
just to “mak siccar.” Victoria is mustering a
strong entry, a conspicuous feature of which
is the number of country rowing clubs —an
unknown quantity in N.S.W. rowing.
“O.P.II.”: Intent upon winning Mel-
bourne’s next liead-of-the-river race, Xavier
College has ordered two new boats —one for
practising and the other for the race. The
school boat club, which comprises ex-scholars
and friends, as well as senior boys, is being
reorganised; there was a deficit of just on
£2OO last year, and £250 is needed for this
year. Xavier has never been head of the
river outright, though it shared the honors
on one occasion. The reason for the special
effort- now being launched is that 1928 will
he the college's jubilee year.
"Shell": Major Goodsell has finally de-
cided to meet Barry, the English sculler, on
September 5 at Vancouver (8.C.) on what
is known as the Upper Inlet. George Mat-
terson, brother of the better-known Neil, is
training Goodsell, and the £lOO deposit has
been lodged by both parties, while the Van-
couver lI.C. will superintend proceedings.
Most people will be glad to hear that the
Australian has abandoned his original inten-
tion of having the race rowed in California,
for the title has never been out of British
hands since its inception in 1876. It will
he the second time the race has been con-
tested at Vancouver. Just 30 years ago Jake
Gaudaur, fresh from beating Stanbury on
the Thames, rowed another Canadian, F.
Johnston, there and won.
& * Jjt *I«
“Port Hedland”: C otain Lowery (B.
26/5/’27) is not the only blind man who
can play cards. Harold Ackland, a West-
ralian. who has been blind for 21 of his 25
years, can play almost any kind of card
game, and is also a good hand at draughts
and chess. He graduated at Perth Uni. two
years ago, winning his B.A. degree; he is
now a teacher of the blind. Mr. Ackland
can find his way about Perth and its sub-
urbs alone and unaided; he doesn’t even
carry a stick.
“Her Jong": Holland has announced the
dates for tin* Olympiad to be held at Amster-
dam next year. May 17 will begin it, and
hockey contests will engage more or less
attention Until May 26. Then football will
take the stage till June 15. It is hoped that
the Australian Soccer people will be able to
send a team; our men’s form against the
Czechd-Slovaks indicates that the Aussies
would beat more than would beat them.
■Track and field athletics will commence on
July 20 and last till. August 6; boxing bouts
arc dated for August 4-7, and swimming will
have a full week, from August 4 to August
11. On all sides one hears of elaborate
organisation of competing teams in Europe
and America. Germany's triumphs at the
English amateur athletic meeting were
largely due to a drive begun 12 months ago
with a view to coaching and training Olym-
pic candidates. Meanwhile the Australian
Olympic Council has gone to sleep again.
“Altcar”: Bitter as the weather was,
20,000 people were at the tin-liare meeting
at Epping (N.S.W.) on Saturday night and
100 bookmakers were standing up. At
Moorefield in the afternoon a pencillcr was
taking s.p. bets on the dogs. The -Epping
bagmen are handing out unstamped tickets,
relying on a clause which exempts betting
on “coursing" from the stamp duty. Con-
sidering that Parliament refused to permit
bookmaking on the business in the first place,
and that the pursuit of the tin hare is not
really “coursing” at all—-they call it “grey-
hound racing” in England, where it origi-
nated—this is pretty rich.
“Hayband” : Despite the superior pace of
its pursuers, and the fact that they are as
devoid of mercy as pig-iron is of moisture,
the odds are that a hare, given its choice,
would prefer life in a coursing enclosure to
battle for existence in the open. At Rooty
Hill (N.S.W.) there about 12 coursing days
p.a., on each of which, roughly, 40 courses
are decided. No hare is coursed more than
once a day, and, seeing that there are gener-
ally* from 80 to 100 in the enclosure, few
are coursed more than half a dozen times
a year. And the off-season lasts eight months
—eight months of peaceful security. The
animal is well fed throughout. An “our-
side” hare has to fend for itself and is liable
to be coursed, trapped, poisoned or shot any
day of the 365. Certainly the sport has
its element of cruelty; but there is cruelty
in most forms of sport.

“Eureka": From a point overlooking the
Sydney Cricket Ground I was listening to
a broadcast description of a football match,
using a portable wireless set. Each time
play was interrupted I heard three referees’
whistles within the space of a second. The
.first came through the loud speaker (wire-
less waves travel fastest), the second was
that carried over the air to the human ear.
and the third was the echo from a rock on
my left. Had I not been a teetotaller I
might have blamed whisky.
"Shrewsbury": In R. Sholl, the Vic.
Rhodes Scholar, who has finished his career
at Oxford by taking a treble in first-class
honors, Australia has an unusual all-rounder.
He has represented the Dark Blues in
athletics and Rugby football. In addition, he
Was in the first Australian-rules match ever
played between Oxford and Cambridge, a
game which, it is hoped, may become an
annual event.

Lord and Lady Stonehaven were the guests
of the Victoria League on Thursday in the
banquet-hall of the Australia. Members took
their jewels out of—wherever they were; also
they donned their wardrobe reserves to honor
the great occasion. Her Ex. had a diamond
and emerald tiara flashing above an old-gold
georgette gown with a fringed jupe and a
few yards of green tulle wound round the
vice-regal throat;. She was given a bunch of
blies of the valley. The general glad hand, as
it were, was extended by Chief Justice and
Mrs. Street, George Fuller and his lady and
Professor MacCallum and his lady. Mrs.
James Ashton, in a stamped velvet, frock that
recalled Joseph's coat, shepherded many of
the more modest souls into the vice-regal pre-
sence when she could manage to kelpie a flock
through the barricade of limelighters. There
was just as eager an advance on the golden
poppy-laden supper-tables after the hand-
shakes and the programme arranged by con-
tralto Lilian Gibson. Harry Thomas and
Norman Jansen. The rosy-cheeked English
hockey players w*ere interesting and inter-
ested guests.
The Palais looked like the audience ball
of some great mediaeval palace on the night
of the International Ball. Beneath its vast
dome, colored to simulate mammoth jewels,
representatives of the nations met, exchanged
greetings, and unanimously went down upon
their knees before Peace, symbolised by Eva
Novak. The Governor and Lady de Chair
and Elaine, charming in sapphire velvet,
took the salute as the nations marched by,
headed by Australia, her personators wear-
ing the officers’ uniforms and the simple
Empire frocks of the end of the eighteenth
century. Bethia Anderson arranged this set
and led it. China followed, with Chinese
girls in gorgeous costumes and arresting
head-dresses. The pretty little Quoy sistei-s
got the set together. Dorothy Lyne arranged
l lie Dutch set, much admired for their blue-
and-white checked frocks, caps and sabots.
May Matchett presented England, dainty and
charming in panniered frilled muslin and
white wigs. Madame Nettement chose the
picturesque flowered shawl, rose apron, black
frock, and goffered fan-framed cap of tlm
Roulonnaise for France. Hanna Tadsen
brought Germany in the most simple of her
peasant garb—tucker of white muslin, velvet-
laced corsage and full skirt—a different
color for each fraulein.
Madame Chrysanthopolus had the gratifi-
cation of scoring the second prize for the
magnificent Greek set, which showed every
stage of Greek history; not the least notable
feature of it was Ben Fuller dressed as Lord
Byron. Close upon the Greek gunners came
Italy, symbolised by Mrs. Stassi carrying
a sword in a jewelled scabbard as big as
herself —it gave the impression that Greece
and Italy were not taking chances of being
caught unawares even in a pageant of peace.
Phases of Italy’s glory followed. Eileen
Aboud arranged the Lebanese set; their full,
gold skirts and head-dresses and tight, black
velvet bodices worn by pretty black-eyed
damsels won third prize. Sculptor Thee
Cowan, Mayor Mostyn and Marion Marcus
Clarke were the judges. Mrs. Norman Lowe
arranged the quaint Siamese set.
Prior to the pageantry the Governor and
Lady de Chair, she gowned in gold-and-
black brocaded metalised cloth, and coron-
eted with diamonds, gave a smile and a
handshake to a bunch of debs., most of them
in national costumes. They were Freda
and Daphne Mulholland, Tally Mason, Eileen
Aboud, Queenie Betar, Thelma Holey, Olga
To we, Dulcie, Essie and Vera Quoy, Wii-
trude Rausch and Myrtle Lorenz. The wives
of the various consuls also made their curt-
sies. No Sydney ball ever before had such a
committee. Lady de Chair headed it, and
there were 21 consuls as vice-presidents.
Before going to the International Ball to
assist Polish Consul-General Earp, Mrs. G.
F. Earp was hostess at the Royal Colonial
Institute at a gathering to speed Captain
and Mrs. Robins, who are en route for
England.
On Saturday night, at Zimbalist’s inspired
fiddling, Lady de Chair wore a scrumptious
black coney coat, with a deep skunk collar,
over her pastel pink crystal-beaded gown,
and a filet of green leaves in her hair;
Elaine’s brocaded coat, with a neck scarf of
white ostrich-feathers, was soft and pretty;
Mrs. Dangar was snug in a marmot coat.
Official Secretary Budge was in attendance.
But furs were not the only comfort in the
Town Hall on Saturday night. The tears
of this Letter seem to have moved the civic
fathers. There were three radiators
installed, and another one to toast the vice-
regal toes, and one on the platform.
Such a number of Japanese have patron-
ised the Zimbalist concerts that no doubt
it was in compliment to them that the violin-
ist played his improvisation of a Japanese
tune. It, was a striking piece of harmony
considering that the musician had only four
bars to work upon.
The Zimbalist pair were treated to tea
and talk and a little music at the Mary
Elizabeth on Friday. Mrs. Gluck-Zimbalist
wore the widest hat Sydney has seen on a
winter’s day for many a month. It was
a lovely thing of light petunia straw, the
brim broadened with a band of tulle and a
big floppy rose nestling on the side. A black
satin coat nearly covered a marocain dress
of the same bright petunia, with little satin
T’s trimming the front. Mrs. Aronson
pressed a bunch of pansies into the lady's
hand. Madame had a cheery word for every
one, but Zimbalist stole into the background,
where he spied Rabbi Cohen, T. 11. Kelly
and manager Jack Griffiths. Shy Dame
Mary requisitioned Mrs. W. A. Holman to
voice the welcome, in which she embodied
her opinion that it was no misfortune for
us to be so far from the world of music,
as it saved our ears being assaulted by the
mediocre and ensured their being treated to
the very best. In the throng were the ladies
of Mark Sheldon and Yic. Wilson, the latter
flaunting a black coat with a wide black
panel of Oriental embroidery and a topping
of amber fur; Mrs. Walter Swinson, wearing
golden brown trappings to match her amber
beads; tall Mrs. Albert Littlejohn, in the
dinkiest little fawn ribbon hat; Mrs. John
McKelvey, with a pink camellia nestling in
her furs to match her cheeks; and Mrs. A. E.
Hughes, her tall inches wrapped in black
velvet and black fox-furs.
The irrepressible undergrads, did terrible
things to Shakspeare at the Conservatorium
on Friday arid Saturday nights. Seemingly
they did not present “As You Like It” in
“modern” dress to save the expense of cos-
tume and scenery, but merely to demonstrate
how readily the immortal bard would bur-
lesque. Burly John Dingle, who stage-
managed the sacrilege, got the youth and
many of the elders grinning by impersonat-
ing vice-chancellor Mungo MacCallum, who
was unable to give the promised opening
address. Looking like the little professor
multiplied by four, the mimic sent his
fellow-students into shrieks of mirth. But
fair Rosalind was not very alluring in riding
breeks, and her lines didn't seem the better
for being delivered between puffs of smoke.
Mimi Spaull was the modern exponent.
Thelma Sundstrom had the best of it as
Celia, in pretty modern frocks suited to
her vivacity and her lisp. Can you picture
Touchstone in plus fours with a monocle
and golf-sticks, juggling with heavy luggage
in the forest? Teddy Larkin made of him
a more ludicrous tiling than ever Shaks-
peare imagined.

The English hockey players were welcomed
on their arrival at Central by Mrs. Colling-
ridge, president of the N.S.W. Hockey Asso-
ciation, and a host of enthusiasts. They
were whisked over to the Ritz at Cremorne,
after a good deal of worry about luggage.
They had been invited to meet the press-
women at the Australia at 2.30, but only
arrived in town in time to be piloted to
Government House, where Lady de Chair
welcomed them in the ballroom at 4 p.m.
As pretty an entertainment as any of
the year took place at the Wentworth on
Saturday afternoon. A host of tiny people
invaded the palm court and the ballroom
looking as if they had stepped out of picture-,
frames and story-books. They were all
dressed in Kate Greenaway costumes, and
they danced sedately to modern music. The
charming entertainment was organised by
Elizabeth Plummer for the Barndrdo Homes,
and its big success was due largely to the
enthusiasm of the Younger Set committee,
with Elaine de Chair at its head. Elaine
was delighted with the doll dance executed
by Lalla Mockbell. She also presented the
prizes—to Phyllis Vale, Esther Stuart. Jessie
Vicars, Ina Fennell, Ruth Docker and
Bruce Jonas.
The 25 maidens who constitute the
younger-set committee for the Royal Life-
Saving Society’s fund have formed a class.
Lessons in resuscitation are in full swing
at Burdekin House, so that the damsels may
be ready for aquatic demonstrations as soon
as spring takes the chill off the baths. For
the garden cabaret in August Mrs. Osbourne
England has thought out an alluring scheme.
Girls dressed as “Mary, Mary, Quite Con-
trary," will not only sell flowers, garden
seeds and implements at the Ambassadors,
but on the day they will deliver flowers in
the suburbs to anyone who likes to order
a box.
This is the latest photo of the young

pliieal follow-

cepted as “the

for his ‘re-
turn.’” He
is an Indian,
of course, edu-
cated and
brought u n
largely by the
patriarch
Lead beater,

cal community
at Clifton Gar-
dens, Sydney.
The “vehicle,"
who plays golf
and tennis but
doesn't jazz, is at present in England.
That most appealing cause, the Hospice
for the Dying, had its annual financial lift
the same night as the International Ball;
but the bigger attraction did not lessen the
crowd at the Wentworth. The same faith-
ful workers, with Mrs. William Maeleod as
head beacon, always assure their patrons
of a jolly time. Hope Major, the Hospice’s
very youthful candidate for the crown of the
Firemen's effort for all hospitals, certainly
had a foretaste of sovereignty. It was her
seventeenth birthday and her friends almost
buried her in fragrant flowers. She held
court in turquoise taffetas with a panel of
silver lace on the tight bodice and full jupe.
Living illustrations of the excellence of
the mothering of the good sisters at St.
Joseph’s Home, Croydon, were given at the
Roslyri Cabaret at the Ambassadors. Two
plump and rosy little girls from the home
With grave courtesy presented the donor of
the home, Mrs. Stuart Patterson, and the
Mayoress with early-Victorian posies.
The Housewives had a wonderful roll-up
on Thursday for Mrs. Marie Holmes’s lecture
on beauty culture; which suggests that the
most practical of the sex has a common
interest with her frivolous sister in a subject
that has never lost favor since the days of
Eden. President Mrs. Perry allowed herself
to be demonstrated upon, and the operation
produced the laughs and smiles which the
lecturer insisted were an essential part of
beauty culture. Fresh air and exercise were
recommended, too; and in case the audience
might be disappointed with the simplicity of
it all she added a recipe for a good surf
cream and recommended ice-water —outside
application—as a skin tonic.
With Mayoress Mostyn at the helm there
was a preliminary effort for the United
Charities’ appeal in a Rose Cabaret at the
Ambassadors last week, when pretty well
every kind of rose that ever bloomed in a
garden or the imagination was sold. An
unusual social light was Albert Gould, who
tea’d at the Mayoress’s table; and Florrie
Howard, one of Rose Day’s consistent sup-
porters, brought a big party.
Tiny baby dolls, dressed daintily in two
blues, reminded patrons of Mont Sant
Angelo ex-students’ annual dance that Wai-
tara Foundlings were to benefit. Represen-
tatives of most of the Catholic colleges loy-
ally supported the good cause and were re-
warded witff seats at the table of the youth-
ful president, Miss Dora Foley.
The Ambassadors was all glorious gold
when the Moore Park Free Kindergarten
committee arranged a dance to garner funds.
Girl pedlars hawked wool wattle-posies, the
real fragant product of the bush and golly
babies, and did a brisk trade. President
Mrs. Sam Walder tuned in beautifully in
her golden frock, but instead of wattle her
fragrant table decoration was a strip of
pink sweet-peas, carnations and Radiance
roses.
St. Luke's Hospital lias some wonderful
friends, who are always vying to excel each
other in their efforts to raise funds. I'oint
Piper centre gave the others something to
beat on Friday night with a dance at the
Ambassadors which drew nearly 500 patrons.
President Mrs. ,T. W. Crane beamed on her
committee from swavhings of black chenille-
embossed georgette and white furs.
Old Sydneians had their annual ball at
the Wentworth last week. Newspaper knight
Fairfax, president of the society, attended
with his lady; and their son Warwick
brought along his fiancee, Betty Wilson.
Scots’ College had the Wentworth on
Friday night for its yearly hop, and the
lion on his blue and gold flag waved gaily
from the balcony over the dancers. College
principal Bee brought Mrs. Bee, who did
honor to the occasion in a gown of blue
and gold.
Lady Stonehaven seemed quite in her ele-
ment at the Chapter House on Friday when
she addressed the Mothers’ Union on Care
of Children. Her Ex. said things that gave
the impression that she is a nice, under,
standing mother. She advocated tin* estab-
lishment of a night nursery where mothers
might leave babies and young children in
trained hands while they went to the pic-
tures, etc. The idea has been mooted before;
now that it comes from such a high source
someone might take notice.
A friend writing from London tells about
the Derby Eve Ball at Albert Hall. It. was
organised by Shiela Loughborough (the
Chisholm girl). The Prince of Wales was
present, and, among other Australians. Mrs.
Chirnside, a Melburnian, and John Dailey.
The most adored man (after the Prince)
was airman Lindbergh, a good-looking youth
who is without the redeeming vices of smok-
ing and drinking.
Ascham Old Girls started this week's
round of college dances at the Ambassadors.
They received their guests in the palm
court under the college flag of red, old-gold
and new-gold. Mrs. M. A. Bnilly, principal
and president of the union, was in jade
and gold and her ex-pupils presented her
with a posy of carnations, daphne and cam-
ellias. Hon sec. Mrs. .1. D. Shane hostessed
a big party, and treasurer Mabelle Marked
entertained in perveuche blue and silver.
Allen, Allen and Hemsley’s staff forgot
all the law they ever knew and danced be-
neath the rainbow lights of the Wentworth
on Monday night, and the Children’s Hospital
will get the pelf, including that raked in by
damsels who dressed themselves as fancy
lollypops in crinkled paper and sold sweets,
whistles and other noises. Mr. and Mrs.
Dundas Allen, she in a frock of amethyst
georgette, gold-beaded, brought a fashionable
crowd.
Livingston Hopkins (a continent knows
him better as "Hop") had an eighty-first
birthday-party at his home in Mosman last
Thursday—partly among the ancient gum and
other native trees which he has preserved. A
few old bowling friends were there; but the
thoughts of most of the 60 or 70 guests
turned more easily to jazz. That and music
(“Hop” still manages his ’cello) and story
(he goes on adding to his repertoire) and
supper and a speech or two —by his old
friend William ilacleod and Messrs. Gurr
and Dunlop—filled the happy night.
N. S. Wales is the mother of another
peeress. ’When Lord Abinger died the other
day he was succeeded by his brother. Major
Hugh R. Scarlett, whose wife is Marjorie,
daughter of John McPhillamy, of Blair
Athol, Bathurst. The Mel’hillamys are very
old-established and wealthy sheep-growers
of those parts.
Mona Caldwell, elder girl of the R. W.
Caldwells, trailed a lovely train of duchess
lace up St. Mark's, Darling Point, where
Keith Myden, formerly of Adelaide, was
waiting to be taken for better or worse.
Noela Caldwell and Marcia Bowman fol-
lowed the ivory-and-silver-clad vision in
pink taffetas and silver lace frocks and be-
coming picture hats of black velvet. The
reception was held at Warrimoo, Coogee,
the home of the groom’s mother, Mrs. E. F.
Wilks.
Artist Henry J. Crisp has never painted
a lovelier picture than he gave away in
St. Alban’s Church, Lindfield, last week
when his eldest girl Marjorie became Mrs.
Rhys Stanford. Her gown of ivory velvet
moulded to her youthful figure, with close-
fitting sleeves and a jupe lengthened by
tulle, was an artistic triumph. Sister Peggy
was in attendance, aglow in sunset chenille-
embossed georgette.
The Burradoo Herbert Friends’ elder
daughter Marion was married on Saturday
afternoon to Dr. Norman Little, of Mass, at
St. Simon and St. Jude's Church, Bowral.
A vellum-velvet robe, long-sleeved and court-
trained. was worn, and a beautiful old lace
veil. Philippa Friend and Ann Jamieson,
as bridesmaids, kept the Bowral chill at bay
in frocks of velvet in lovely wallflower
shades. Vernon Bruce Smith and the bride's
brother Herbert were next-best men.

The opening of Victoria’s twenty-ninth
Parliament was notable, as it marked the
return to the old home in Spring-street after
on exile of 27 years. The Federalists left
the place in good order, and everything was
spotless. From the ladies’ gallery one
looked upon benches re-upholstered, tables
re-covered in crimson felt and a really beau-
tiful new carpet, and the mace carried by
file now sergeant-at-arms was polished till
it shone again. All galleries were crowded
and on the floor of the House the visitors
overflowed even into the front-row seats.
Over a thousand were bidden to a garden-
party after the opening. The House of Gab
has a nice bit of backyard, laid out in lawns,
bowling-green and tennis-court, and the party,
si hark-back to bygone customs, was much
more enjoyable than the usual indoor tea-
drinking without elbow-room. The weather
was dull and cold, but a string orchestra
and a liberal allowance of eatables bright-
ened the outlook.
Lady Somers, in a suit of natural kasha
with rose and green embroidery and harmon-
ising millinery, sat with Premier Hogan’s
Avife, who Avas a study in pervenche blue, her
coat trimmed with grey fox-fur and topped
with a felt hat of the same shade. The
Clarke lady also chose an all blue turn-
out. Archgaiters Lees put on hid crimson
Doctor’s goAvn and made a brave splash of
color. Most of the feminine guests were well
coated and fur-wrapped. Mayoress Morell
wore a mole cloak with a dark grey gown,
the Mackey lady was in a coney seal coat
with black velvet hat, and Mrs. Stanley
Argyle favored similar apparel. Mrs. H. 11.
Smith chose rust-red crepe-de-Chine, with hat
to match and musquash wrap. Mrs. A. S.
Woolcott, with her daughter Francie, Mrs.
Big Brother Linton, the Consuls and their
womenfolk, the Elmer Pauly couple, Mrs.
Couchman, president of the W.N.L., Mrs.
Glencross, president of the National Council
of Women, and Archdeacon and Mrs. Hind-
ley were glimpsed.
Posies appeared on every coat lapel and
costume corsage and nestled among furs
at Flemington racecourse on Saturday.
Women who were afraid to risk their very
best furs on the other two days took a chance
on this occasion, and there was a fine display
of pelts. Fur chokers also got a good run
—wearers of tailored suits topping their
covering with attractive skins in almost
every instance. A weird coat looked like
Aussie fox—pale amber sprinkled with in-
numerable plump tails. The mercury hav-
ing crept a shade higher, though the weather
was gloomy, velvet frocks and wraps were
more numerous and some new jumper suits
had an outing. The State Governor Avas
there with Colonel Davidson and an aide
or two, but the vice-regal pen was deserted
all the afternoon. General Chauvel brought
his lady, whose sapphire blue coat with
skunk bordering was allied to a cheerful
striped beige and burgundy hat. Mrs. Fred
Thiel topped charming black apparel with
a lilac felt hat. A gorgeous squirrel coat
covered Mrs. Len Buxton, and Madame
Mortill’s cape of the same felt was worn
Avith mushroom pink millinery; Mrs. Neville
Fraser was tailor-suited in fancy grey tweed
Avittli harmonising fox choker and Wedg-
iirnod blue felt hat. Mary Winter Irving’s
frock of reseda green velvet was worn with
a hat of paler hue. Gwen Tait was an-
other smart lass in coat and skirt of
black fox furs, and pistachio green felt hcad-
covering. Doreen Gale drew a black velvet
wrap around her, and Elva Rosenthal’s
squirrel cape Avas accompanied by a navy
blue hat that had a lining of sulphur tone.
Marjorie Rutherford introduced a bit of
Sydney style—a cloth coat of silver grey
with a high crowned felt headpiece of Avine
tone. America's Consul-General Arthur
Garrels and his wife, Vice-Admiral Napier
and his lady, Mrs. Alister Clark; Ella Guth-
rie, the Clarke lady and a daughter; and
Mrs. W. B. Adamson and daughter Hester
Avere promenaders.
The Animal Week Ball at the Embassy
gave the dancers an opportunity to spend
money on paper caps, smokes, raffles and
so forth, and they responded liberally. Mrs
Norman Brookes, avlio wore violet georgette,
fringed, was president of tin- committee ; the
duties of secretary being taken by Mrs. Cor-
rie Gardner, whose petunia-colored apparel
Avas brightened with silver ribbon. The Chief
Justice's daughter Nancy, with glimmer of
sequins and beads upon a frock of pale blue,
and Marie Greene, clad in floral taffeta, had
shown that they knew how to sell the tickets,
and looked justly gratified at the muster.
Fred Krcrouse’s wife, in shimmering jade
blue, and Mrs. Harold Clapp, with sparkle
of onyx upon lemon-shaded covering, were
keen traders for the cause; and they were
abetted by Mrs. James Purves—in a robe
grey and scintillating—Hilary Rolls, Elsa
Andrew —she in a cloud of grey chiffon—anti
others. Mrs. Lort Smith and her sister,
Marion Montgomery, helped with the man-
agement. Comedian Bentley, of the Bose
Marie” Co., made a good auctioneer, and
roped in a useful £25. Jascha Heifetz, Ayho
came with Charles Tail, demonstrated that
lie can shake a toe as well as a bow, and
bought a crocodile-skin bag at auction for
£Ui. There was exhibition dancing by Marie
Tait, a fairy-like form in white tulle
sprinkled Avitli dewdrops, and a partner.
Mrs. Val Macdonald wore a gown of soft
blue hue with additions of crystal beads:
Mrs. Neville Fraser’s good looks were set
off by a full-skirted black taffeta frock and
a corsage outlined with gold embroidery;
Mrs. Henry Rosenthal was in raiment of
metallic tissue that blended silver, blue, atld
golden brown; Charles Tait’s Avife was a
neat figure with gold-sequinned tracery on.
a black robe; Eileen Starr glimmered in a
halo of pink, and Norma Collins displayed
a dash of Spanish in a red frock frilled m
black.
A bridge-party and dance at the W attic
tea-rooms on Friday night had the East Mel-
bourne Foundling Hospital as its beneficent
object. Mrs. A. T. Ham lent the rooms, and
supplied refreshments and service. A city
firm lent some, gorgeous Oriental draperies.
Ticuets sold readily and raffles and sales
swelled the takings to close on £5OO. Ihe
president of the hospital committee, Mis.
Montague Cohen, was a very busy person m
black with crystal embroidery. Mrs. Ham
wore a rose-red traced with silver and re-
ceived a posy of roses. Mrs. W. M. Robins
arid Mrs. Clarence Marriott ran a floAver-
stall, and Mrs. 11. J. Robertson, president
of the Women’s Auto Club, and Mrs. Edgar
Dye sold sweets. Mayoress Morell, who was
enveloped in a brocaded silver wrap over a
steel-embroidered grey gown, was a liberal
buyer of trifles. Her daughter Sheila was
handsome in a frock of sunset-pink hue. Rear-
Admiral Napier and Mrs. Napier she m
floating covering of soft pink hue, the Mac-
key lady, the E. M. Pearce couple, the IT. H.
Smiths, the W. E. Bateses and Mrs. Charles
Hicks were in the throng.
Pennants, life-buoys and other emblems of
a life oil the ocean wave gave a nautical
touch to St Kilda Town Hall one night
last Aveek, when the Royal St. Kilda Vacht
Club indulged in jazz. Commodore J.
White was at the helm ivith Ins wife to
welcome the guests. She was taut and
trim in sequined raiment of the hues o_t a
calm sea flecked with sunlight. C. B. Mc-
Cutcheon, commodore of the Royal xaent
Club of Victoria, brought his Avife, who
was rigged in black and gold brocade. St.
Kilda’s Mayor, Burnett Gray, and his
Mayoress were there, she with black tulle
flounces fringing a gilded tunic. Squadron-
Leader Wrigley and Mrs. Wrigley, the It. M
Cuthbertsons. Town Clerk Chamberlin and
his wife and* a full company of the younger
generation made up the crew.

The frocks at the St Kilda Mayoral ball
glistened and gleamed with sequins of every
shape and form, making a regular constel-
lation of stars, comets and meteors of beads
and bugles. The ballroom Avas gay with
crimson and gold. Fur-trimmed mayoral
robes overhung with gold chains moved majes-
tically to syncopated strains. Mayoress Gray
Avore gold tissue upon mauve georgette with
attachments of gold fringe and embroideries,
set off with a harmonising bouquet. Frank
Clarke was there with his lady, who carried
a blue feather fan against a gown of black
filmy lace, and General Blarney brought his
wife, whose vellum-toned georgette frock had
embellishment of gold sequins. Mrs. Solo-
mon, wife of Geelong’s chief-magistrate, was
sheathed in cornflower-blue sequins with a
floral decoration in seed pearls. Mrs. R.
M. Cuthbertson, gowned in cream and gold,
and Mrs. Jim Angus, robed in oyster-grey
satin, we're glimpsed in the throng. Town
Clerk Chamberlin was an excellent stage-
manager. and his wife, whose black robe was
enlivened with gold, proved a good friend to
the social scribes.

Youth twirled and flirted at the Newman
College students’ annual reunion at Bt. Kilda
Town Hall one night last week, when the
Cussen lady, in black lace and georgette,
and the college matron, Miss Egan, were
hostesses, posies being their reward. Profes-
sor Scutt was there with his wife, whose
black gown had a veneer of midnight-blue
and black beads. Trinity’s warden, Dr. J.
C. V. Behan, brought his life-partner in
tissue that glistened gold iind red. Margaret
Malone wore a frock of silver and blue and
Tulla Keating was a willowy figure in a
robe of glistening white. Surgeon Hugh
Devine and his wife were dancers and the
rector of Newman, Father J. Murphy, blessed
the gathering with his presence.
On Saturday night at the Theatre Royal
an overflowing audience gave Marie Burke
and her company a warm welcome. The
piece was “Frasquita,” which had its first
showing in these parts. Miss Burke as the
gypsy heroine wore a skirt of handkerchief
frills of rainbow hue, a lemon-hued bodice,
many necklaces and a gay kerchief on her
hair. When the nomad turns cabaret dancer
she makes entrance in frock of roseate hue
with large millinery of the same tone. Her
evening wrap of the last act causes a stir
in feminine quarters. Of the loveliest shade
of green chiffon velvet it sparkles with steel
embroidery, with additions of a beautiful fur
collar and a deep border of fur round the
hem. A dainty all-silver gown is partly con-
cealed by this charming finery. Marie Eaton,
who makes a welcome reappearance, looks
attractive in peasant costume and later dons
raiment of gold lace. Thelma Buruess wears
several pretty frocks and there is a ballet
that tops old gold satin flounces with cherry-
red hats and whose toes are shod with red.
Thurza Rogers trips daintily in a ballet
frock of layers of soft pink, with a bodice
of glistening beads. The audience was well
dressed —a regular gleam of tissue bridge
coats and wraps of white fur met the eye.
Among first-nighters were the William Cam-
eron couple, Alderman and Mrs. Crespin, the
James Purves lady and her sister, Florrie
Green, the William Merry couple, the Philip
Nunns, the C. J. Aherns and Mrs. F. J.
Clendinning.
The four performances of Pirandello’s
“Six Characters in Search of an Author” by
the Repertory Society, with Gregan Mc-
Mahon as producer and principal, created
a good deal of controversy—a learned pro-
fessor lectured about it and the newspapers
had a lot to say—and with so much free
publicity success was assured. Flattering
remarks have been made about Dulcie
Bland’s portrayal of the erring daughter. In
her all-black turnout of velvet and lace she
looked strikingly good-looking. Artist George
Bell’s wife Avore the black trailing draperies
and bonnet of the mother in approved
funereal manner. Maisic Bennett was pretty
in a frock of apricot hue with a dinky little
matching toque. Noticed in the first-night
audience were Professor and Mrs. Rivett,
the Consul-General for Italy and Donna
Grossardi, Professor Gunn and his life part-
ner, Signor Pascale, North Bananaland’s
new Italian Vice-Consul, and the Miller lady.
Three one-act plays by members were put
on at the Lyceum Club last week, and the
audience crowded the* reception-room, not-
withstanding that the weather was cold and
very wet. Isabel Handley, who has several
actable pieces to her credit, was responsible
for “Mistress Betty Treads u Measure,” an
episode of the road in 1780. She wore the
hooped skirts and panniers of the heroine
with distinction. Mrs. Elizabeth Apperly
produced “The Lie,” by Mary Wilkinson,
playing the leading role. A coveted prize
and a dream were ingredients in “Professors
are Human,” made by someone too modest
to claim it. Lieutenant-Colonel White’s wife
played the most important feminine part. An
interesting musical interlude was supplied by
pianist Katie Liddle.
’ The earliest of spring models were shown
last week in a Collins-street atelier, a trio
of smart mannequins officiating. Paris still
clings to the jumper suit of light woollen or
silken fabric, and the latest, of these gar-
ments show trimmings of narrow bands of
various colors appliqUed upon the cuffs,
round the body and down the front, the
skirts being left plain. One-piece frocks are
revealing curves again and skirts are dis-
tinctly longer. Black gowns still push them-
selves into the picture—they suit so many
people—and moire has returned to favor.
Touches of white, mole or tones of fawn re-
lieve the mourning effect in most cases.
Very narrow gold or silver belts and buckles
the same shade as the costume are up-to-the-
ininute conceits. Evening gowns are long
of bodice, terminating in fussy circular
flounces of tulle or lace. Long-sleeved gowns
of black lace and ninon frocks adorned
merely with pin tueks are also to be worn
this season.
Past students of the Sucre Coenr Eon-
vent, East Malvern, have undertaken to
maintain the Madeleine Barat Free Kinder-
garten at Footscray, a new institution, and
on Friday afternoon Lady Somers was bid-
den to see what had been accomplished and
to open the school. There was a short
entertainment of games, songs and minia-
ture band items by little ones. Education
Minister Prendergast proposed the vote of
thanks to the Governor’s lady, who received
welcome from tlio Mayor and Mayoress or
Footscray. Mrs. J. H. Keating presides
over the committee, of which Patricia Gaff-
ney and Mary Meagher are honorary sec-
retaries and Mrs. J. Breheny treasurer. A
tea-party was given to the mothers of pupils.
The bridesmaids-of the Webster-Boothby
wedding dangled holly from their brow-bands
of gilded leaves, and bouquets of the crim-
son berries blended with their frilled frocks
of golden-hued tulle. The bride, Marjorie
Kathleen, daughter of the Brinsley Boothby
couple of Armadale, changed her name in a
gown of cream and gold, with tulle veil and
a train scattered with orange-buds. She
gave her promises to Richard Webster, a
son of the Percy Websters, of Toorak, and
a partner with Lockhart Little in Talla-
bung station, N.S.W.
An old Melbourne boy recently faced the
altar at St. Paul’s. Valetta. He was Lieu-
tenant Hugh Webb Falkiner, R.N.; his ship,
the Malaya, was stationed at Malta. _ The
wedding was a naval and military tie-up.
The bride, Olave Mary, is the youngest daugh-
ter of Lieutenant Colonel and Mrs. Younger,
of Roxburghshire. The bridegroom’s father,
the late W. C. Falkiner, was for many years
a well-known Sunbury resident.
When Helen Aitken, eldest daughter of
Mrs. Aitken and the late J. T. Aitken of
Boronia, became Mrs. Frederick Hitchcock
at the Melbourne Grammar School Chapel
she was in a mist of beautiful creamy lacc.
The gown, her mother’s wedding-dress, was
long of skirt and sleeve, and a tulle veil,
softly frilled, completed the picture. The
three ’maids wore pink, covered with gold
lace, and pink coiffures. He is a son of
the late Rev. de Putron Hitchcock, and is
attached to Dookie College.
Geelong reports another engagement. Lorna
Cleeve Cox, whose dad is manager of the
Bank of ’Asia there, has accepted a ring from
Hector Charles, eldest son of the C. H.
Mclntyres, of Winchelsea.
One of the pleasantest patches in the
Elgar recital of the British Music Society
on Friday night was the singing of “Sea
Pictures” by Jean Hambleton. The Melba
Con.’s Ladies’ Choir, under Fritz Hart,
showed its paces in “The Snow” and I ly,
Singing Bird.” Violinist Gertrude Healy
gave a violin sonata, with Mrs. H. E. Spry
at the piano. Harold Browning added, by
way of variation, songs by Frank Bridge,
Villiers Stanford and Gibbs.
Ethel Martyr has hit on an original way
of telling bedtime stories for the radio. Her
tale of “a little girl who lived two thousand
years ago” is interspersed with quaint rhymes
which Willie .Tames lias set to music. The
result has been broadcast very successfully.
Byrl Walkley makes a handsome Trilby
in the Moscovitcli production at the King s,
and looks the part both in the old military
coat of the first act and the trailing gold
gown with Medici collar of the later appear-
ances. Beatrice Day wears the grey gown,
dolman and bonnet of Mrs. Bagot with dis-
tinction and ease. There were flowers for
the three ladies of the show at the curtain.

that has established 10 world speed records

Ike, Commander
The Greatest Feat of Post War Automotive Engineering
New Reduced Price, i62S
In a sensational test made at Culver City, California, U.S.A., under the auspices of the American
Automobile Association, The Commander, a strictly stock enclosed car, travelled 5,000 miles in
4,909 minutes —better than mile-a-minute speed for 81 consecutive hours and 49 minutes. At
the same time this amazing new car established nine other world records.
Over thirty of America’s steepest hills it has scored thirty victories and established thirty new records,
each test being supervised by police authorities and motor club officials. Thus has The Commander
triumphantly proved its ability to Out-Speed, Out-Climb, Out-Perform, and Out-Live all comers.
What these records mean to you l
You probably will never need a mile-a-minute speed for 5000 miles —travel at 70 miles per hour—
or even want to enter a hill-climbing contest. But by achieving these remarkable feats the New
Commander has proved that it is a swift, rugged, powerful and dependable piece of machinery,
entitled to very first rank among the truly great automobiles of the world.
Learn more about this record-breaking car, the duplicate of which is waiting to give you an entirely
new conception of really fine car performance, power and comfort.

A beautifully mild evening was set for
the State reception to the Goodwins. The
Forgan Smiths did the receiving, and there
was a background of wattle for the guests.
Supper was served in Parliament House
dining-room, with a special table for the
vice-regals decked with sweet peas. Lady
Goodwin wore moonlight blue and an ermine
stole. Mrs. .Campbell was in ivory with
a peach-pink miroir velvet coat. Mrs. For-
gan Smith wore black Chantilly, charmante
and patterned gold ; Mrs. A. E. Moore wore
red; Mrs. William Lennon, black; Mayoress
Jolly, amber; Mrs. T. J. Ryan, white and
silver; Mrs. M. L. Reading; floral beaten
tissue; Mrs. J. L. Woolcock, mignonette
green. Now the tide of welcome is washing
the South Coast, where Southport and Cool-
angatta arc flying the bunting.
At Melba’s first concert Lady Goodwin and
Colonel and Mrs. Cameron attended and
seemed delighted with everything, especially
Stuart Robertson’s sea chanties. Melba is
looking very fit since her trip North, and
lmd no reason to complain of her reception.
On the first night she wore white and silver
and pearls; on the second, black and silver,
with diamond and emerald ornaments added
to the pearls. Dr. Mayne sent up a floral
harp as tall as the Dame, made of red roses
and violets; and the other bouquets were
very beautiful. The second concert was
broadcast, and the diva made two speeches.
The Women’s Club entertained Melba in
a setting of roses. Dame Nellie was in
burgundy with a grey fur-trimmed coat and
grey hat. Mrs. Ross-Munro came with her.
A bunch of yellow roses and mauve orchids
was presented by the president, Mrs. Wedd.
Eunice Cochrane, Adeline College, Nancy
Murhead, and Mary and Yada Jeffries made
music.
George Addison has lost liis mother, widow
of George Addison, who was a prominent
architect here and a capable black-and-
white artist. George junior married Miriam,
daughter of F. C. Urquhart, until recently
Administrator of the Northern Territory.

his descriptions of Nature rioting in New
Guinea are very well worth listening to.

Adelaide.
Douglas Mawson’s lady, Dr. Helen Mayo
and Mrs. de Crespigny were at the Mothers
and Rabies’ Health Centre to meet Mrs.
Bruce and explain its work to her, while
the Priminister was making speeches to poli-
cal and business men. _ From there Mrs.
Bruce went to a Babies’ Hospital, an
interested visitor, as a baby health-centre
on similar lines is one of her schemes for
Canberra. In the afternoon there was tea
with the Mayoress.
The Children’s Hospital is one of the
charities to benefit by the Duncan lady s
will, sworn at £90,000. It was always neai
to her heart.
The week-end gave us two concerts, tin
second of the Filippini grand opera pro-
grammes at the Town Hall and the Glee
Club and S.A. Orchestra jointly at the
Exhibition. Both were packed, which shows
that we are growing in numbers or musi-
cal appreciation, or both. At the Exhibi-
tion. Grieg's “Great White Host,” with
Hector Mellish as soloist, was an outstand-
ing number, and another was a Brahms
rhapsody, with Olive Basnett as singer. There
was dancing by Wanda Edwards’s pupils.
The Filippini Co. scored in having Topsie
Doenau at the piano—as an accompanist
she has few equals—and Carmenita Mas-
cagni’s rich soprano was at its best.
Illness (she, has had mumps) kept Lady
Bridges away from the Victoria League’s
annual meeting, and tonsilitis laid the Gov-
ernor low at Beltana on his way back from
opening the T.B. hostel at Angerichina.
The week-end saw everybody dancing—
the University Dance Club in the Elder
Hall, which transformed itself into a daffo-
dil garden for the evening, and where Pro-
fessor and Mrs. Harvey Johnstone did the
honors ; one time pupils of the High School
at the Maison de Dance at Glenelg; insur-
ance men and their friends in the Osborne
Hall; Gunners and their friends at Norwood
(an annual affair to commemorate the
battle of Hamel), and at the Masonic Hall
a subscription dance for St. Mary’s Mission
of Hope. Earlier in the week were the
Christian Brothers’ College dance, also at
Norwood, and the Tennis Association s
frivol at the Masonic Hall. A committee
of the younger set ran the mission dance,
with Mrs. Wheadon and Mrs. McMichael to
help them.
A note from London: —
There is not a prima donna or film star in London
that does not envy the wife of Adelaide’s ex-Mayor
Moulden the lavish Press space which is being devoted
to her and her three girls, the daughters of Perth’s
late Knight Hackett, Patricia, Verna and Jean.
AVhen the papers are not explaining how Patricia
studied Roman law while held up in a queue of
motors bound for the Royal Court at which she was
presented, they intrigue the public with tales of
Verna’s progress in her medical course at King’s
College, and Joan’s mastery of many tongues. Even
the boy of the family is busy enough to interest
the London reading public; for it is recorded that
at 16 he is the head of his school. In addition to
piloting her own three daughters to the throne-roopi,
the lady had enough energy left to guide into the
Royal presence Miss Teesdale Smith, whose gown
would account for a big slice of the profit on one
of her father’s contracts.
TASMANIA.
Hobart.
The Governor 'anti Margaret O'Grudy
were at the concert at the Town Hall in
aid of Maxwell Godfrey, who was lost, m
the bush during this winter’s worst cold
snap, and had to have both feet amputated
as the result of frost-bite.
His Ex. and Miss O’Grady went to Laun-
ceston for the St. Patrick’s ball, of which
Elvie Quigley and M. J. Traynor were joint
secretaries. Among other Hobart people
there were the Ogilvies and Dr. and Mrs.
Batten. The Northerners included Com-
mander and Mrs. Eardley AVilmot and the
Claude Jameses.
The Turf Club's meeting at Elwick was
blessed with glorious weather, but there
might have been a better attendance. The
racing was excellent. Furs were in order, or
the thickest of cloth coats.
Mrs. Charley Campbell, who helped Mrs.
Ray Butler to launch our Chaucer tea-room
and library a couple of years ago, is leaving
to take Oldie Smith's place as part-manager
of The Oaks, in Melbourne. Miss Smith,
well known in the Speck, is for marriage
and Malaya in the near future.
The Uni. students and their friends had
a dance in the library of the Uni., where
a great log tire kept out the cold. About
!)0 young things and a small sprinkling of
their elders enjoyed the fun.
Evan Crane, little blonde daughter of the
Union Bank’s retired manager, has been
nominated by headquarters to represent
Tassie Girl Guiders at the Switzerland Con-
ference and camp in August. She is at
present in London.
WESTRALIA.
Perth.
Our smartest affair this week was the
coming-out dance of the Hylton Dales' only
daughter, Ydonea, at the Karrakatta Club.
Mrs. Hylton-Dale received the 200 guests in
coral-pink georgette, with roses and silver
woven in adornment and a spray of golden
buttercups as head-dress. Ydonea was in
white and silver. The ITylton-Dales have
been touring Syria and other Oriental coun-
tries.
At the Karrakatta Club’s social Mrs.
George Haywood arranged the musical pro-
gramme. Miss Genoni, who is to return to
Italy soon to pursue her vocal studies, was
the bright star.
The Silver Chain dance, held in Govern-
ment House ballroom, and organised by Mrs.
Arthur Jacoby, was an enjoyable but not
by any means crowded affair. The prize
fell to the Turkish Gentlemen and Persian
Ladies set, arranged by Mrs. Jarvis.
“The Girl in the Taxi,” staged at His
Majesty’s by the Society of Concert Artists,
was a most successful venture. The frocking
was particularly good. Mrs. Herbert Mil-
lard sported an effective blue and silver
woven over in cyclamen color, and Marcia
Hodges was charming in shell pink and
silver, with clusters of forget-me-nots.
The Repertory Club’s Mondays and the
Green Club’s Tuesdays help to fill out the
week in Women’s Clubland. Each brings a
good musical programme, with a tea and
cake interlude. Dr. D. D. Baton’s wife
was hostess at the last Repertory affair, and
Gladys Orchard did the honors at the Green
Club!

They were sacrificed to Moloek, Bel, Baa), Beelzebub
And many a wife is slaughtered to appease a hub.
The Judges on the bench have their Victims, too, in

THE INKY WAY.
(London) : David Low, who went
from The Bulletin to the London Star,
is at the moment shifting across to the
Express. Low is so easily and conspicu-
ously first among cartoonists in England
that there was keen competition for his
services as his contract with the “Cadbury
press” drew to an end, and Lord Beaver-
brook had to pay £4OOO a year to get him.
“Adam Ant”: The Melbourne Sun Pic-
torial, under its new editor, Ralph Sim-
monds, is breaking into punning captions. A
parson who grubbed a stump for an old
woman has a big black-lettered heading,
“Nothing Stumps This Cleric.” The final
cable tram to Richmond was accorded a mid-
night send-off, and passengers sang “Auld
Lang Syne,” which enabled the Sun to pre-
face its paragraph with “Auld Clang Syne.”
“Freeze a Jolly Good Fellow” headed a Jack
Frost par, and the same page had “It’s
Snow Joke” over a similar item. Further
outrages are apprehended.
“Con Drew” : In the press stand at Iland-
wick one bumps against an occasional old-
timer who has weathered the storms since
the ’nineties, but they are getting scarcer
every year. In the old days the pressbox
held a jovial crowd. Among them were
Rowley Pickering (“Nemo” of the Mail),
Bob Moston ( Daily Telegraph ), Spencer
Cornford (“Early Bird” of the Star) . Frank
Wilkinson (“Martindale” of the News),
Tom Power, Tom Willis. Jack Dexter and
a host of others. Nat Gould, then “Verax”
of the Referee, but later known to the
world as a writer of sporting novels, was
also a frequenter of the Randwick pressbox,
but lie. like most of the old-time pressmen,
has spiked his last sheaf of copy.
“Lao-dah”: Since the Argus set the fash-
ion, other Melbourne newspaper offices have
been on the move. The old Herald office in
Flinders-street, since shared by the Morning
Post, Smith’s Weekly and The Bulletin,
is earmarked for the purposes of jazz comedy
and vaudeville. ■ Smith’s and The Bulletin
have moved to the building further up tin-
street where the Sun set two years ago, and
the Post is looking for accommodation else-
where. Although the Age still clings to
Collins-street and the Argus has marooned
itself in the wilds of Elizabeth-street, Flin-
ders-street is likely to become the Fleet-street
of Melbourne eventually, especially for even-
ing papers. The growing congestion in the
heart of the city is becoming a nightmare
for the papers that have to get to the rail-
ways and the suburbs.
“J. 8.”: In July, 1912, the first annual
report and balance-sheet of the Australian
Journalists’ Association, N.S.W. branch, was
presented to a nominal roll-call of 243 mem-
bers : this year’s official report was issued
to 605 inky wayfarers. Things were very
onkus when the first committee took office,
in June, 1911. There were then only 130
members and no offices except the old Press
Club cellar under the Tivoli Theatre, occu-
pied rent-free by the grace of .T. C. Leete, at
that time manager for Rickards. However,
things soon started to move as they never
could have done under the old Institute of
Journalists. Salaries were shouldered up and
conditions generally improved. The better-
ment inaugurated has been increasing ever
since, and employers have benefited, too.
although few of them regarded the movement
with favor.
A contributor, figuring out the circulation
of N.S.W. papers from the amount of Lang’s
illegal ha’penny tax which was refunded and
which they handed to charities, said (B.
80/6/’27) that on this basis the S. M.
Herald’s circulation might be placed as
“well over 122,000 daily, even during the
three-ha'penny period.” In addition to the
allowances made in this estimate, however,
there were the papers sent to other States
and Canberra and subscribers’ copies: so
that, as the contributor suggested, the 122,000
was very well inside the mark. The Herald's
present circulation is 178.000 on Saturdays
and 168.000 on other days. It doesn’t, how-
ever. make any song and dance about the
bulky figure; this indeed is the first time
for many years that anything authentic has
been published about the Herald's circula-
tion. The last previous occasion was when
the Sun claimed a larger circulation than
any other two Sydney dailies put together.
Watkin Wynne, of the D.T.. which was then
claiming better sales than the Herald, went
to W. G. Conley, general manager of the
Herald. Wynne was very angry. “What are
we going to do about it?" he demanded.
“Nothing,” said Conley. So Wynne started
a fight on his own account, and for four
days the Sun and D.T. waged an inky war-
fare about circulation. Then the S. M.
Herald without any fuss or preface calmly
announced one morning: “The circulation of
the Herald is 136.000.” and the other two
shut up like rat-traps. Incidentally the
Fairfaxes art' losing something over £lOO.OOO
a year on actual sales of the paper. But
the ads. wipe out that deficit and earn a
little extra by way of profits.
THE SPRING POEM.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
(July another month or two,
And bits of vernal verse are due
Among the formes they fix,
Those little lays that sweetly sing
The sunlit days of coming spring
And winter’s dying kicks.
The poet greets the splendid sun
And sings because the winter's done
With storm and icy gust.
Thrilled to the core by buds and birds
lie lets him go in lilting words
(You think) because he must.
But all those tender odes to spring,
Poems that seem all wind and wing,
Have through the winter slept;
Some months ago those rondels gay
Were neatly typed and put away
And in cold storage kept.
For only once in every year
May springtime poetry appear.
You must be up to date!
Brief is the season in our land;
Thaw out ahead of the demand—
No editor will wait!

The Sydney University students who set
themselves to bring “As You Like It” up to
date at the Conservatorium last Friday and
Saturday carried out their idea with joyous
abandon. The exiles in the Forest of Arden
had a wireless-set in their sylvan lair; Or-
ando made his entry upon them revolver in
hand; “Under the Greenwood Tree” was
played to the tinkling accompaniment of one
ot the instruments which modern America
lias given the world; and cigarettes were in
brisk demand amongst the performers. The
language of Shakspeare, when it was not
pushed aside for some modern by-play,
blended rather grotesquely with the sur-
roundings, but not _ more grotesquely than
some of the play-action—as when the tennis
party was interrupted so that the Duke
Frederick could amuse himself with the
wrestlers. Still, the presentation was rather
well done, in spite of the tendency of some
of the minor characters to grin at the good
joke they were helping to “put across.” Edward
Larkin was decidedly good as a restless
I ouchstone, Rosalind and Celia were attrac-
tively portrayed by Mimi Spaull and Thelma
Sundstrom, Herbert Hogbin -was a fine-
looking Orlando and George Cassidy passed
as Jaques. It was at least a merry per-
formance. intensified by the audacity of one
player who “made-up” to some resemblance
of a popular professor.
This afternoon the sadness of farewell
will envelope Alexander Watson, who has
kept Sydney King’s Hall full for close on
three weeks. Barrie’s ‘‘Little Minister” is the
main item to be repeated. It is a favorite;
and the reciter displays a more sympathetic
appreciation of Barrie than of any other of
his authors. Rod Quinn has been given a
few showings; an all-Australian night would
have been a graceful and commendable inno-
vation.

The Sydney Empire Theatre introduces its
second venture, “The Student Prince,”
on Saturday night, when the management
requests patrons to be in their seats at
7 p.m. This musical adaptation of the
delightful “Old Heidelberg” had a long
run in the United States; this Showman
registers a pious hope that the sprig of
royalty has left his Murkan accent behind.
Another newcomer. “Not To-night, Dearie.”
arrives at the Grand Opera House, where
I- rank Neil reckons upon repeating the suc-
cess lie secured with “Getting Gertie’s Gar-
ter ” The Theatre Royal, which bids
Billie Lockwood and “The Green Hat” fare-
well to-morrow night (Friday), is passed
over to the film for a time ; but the pictur-
ed story of “Ypres” should be some com-
pensation for that. The J.C.W. firm
had bad luck in the illness of Judith Ander-
son after it had pushed out the well-running
Six-Cylinder Love” to find a theatre for
her; "Rain” is now definitely shunted.
Madame Pompadour” keeps Her Majesty’s
well filled; last week William Perry-
man made the most of a brief tliree-days’
opportunity in the part of Rene given him
by tlie illness of Frank Webster. The flesh
of Criterion audiences is still kept a-creep
by the load of mystery which “The Ghost
Train” carries; and “Cradle Snatchers”
seems likely to score a century at the
Palace. Phil Lytton has borrowed some of
the advertisement thunder of the movies for
“The Sheik” ; Robert Ginns is now described
as “The Lover with the Bedroom Eyes,”
whatever that may mean. The desert drama
will doubtless keep the St. James full until
the dainty theatre is wanted for Fullers’
“Lady, Be Good,” booked to arrive on July
30.
Dick Henderson, with his machine-gun
humor, has had his little hour at Sydney Tivoli
and gone liis way again. But he has left
a mark behind; that little trick of “Joke
passed!” delivered with a little chirrup when
one of his shots fails to hit a laugh has
already been popularly adopted. Valencia
is doing thrilful things on a swinging rope;
and Achilles nonchalantly permits cannon-
balls and articles resembling 12in. shells to
flop upon bis shoulders and arms, whilst
partner Newman relieves the strong-man act
with comic imitations. Maxim Brodi is to
be commended for including “Night-time,”
a locally-built _ song which contains some
good melody, in his tuneful turn. Next
Monday the Tivoli Follies are to make a
start, and those remarkable apes, Max,
Moritz and Akka, whose acquaintance Aus-
t rail a has already made through the pictures,
will be already on the bill.
The latest shutile at Sydney Fullers' brings
Stilly and Mo out as “The Plumbers.” It is a
briskly-moving jumble of entertainment, ami
would be more amusing without the evil-
smelling sauce the principal comedians think
it necessary to serve for the vicious palates
of some of their audience. Amy Rochelle,
who has grown remarkably robust, main-
tains her popularity with the audience; the
smiling Stattler sisters do their share, and
Alec Kellaway provides moments of tuneful-
ness.
❖ * * Ji:
They are thrifty folk at Hollywood. Hav-
ing built a picturesque seaside Italian vil-
lage somewhere* in California for the loca-
tion of a film thriller, the canny producer
has used the scene twice, the second time
for “The Sea Tiger.” Supposed to be in
Sicily, this picture revives the old theme
of brothers who both love the same girl.
A stage vamp complicates the story, but
the chief features are the tremendous tor-
rents of rain, the realistic rescue of a sailor
in a raging storm and a number of frenzied
lights that occur. The virtuous and statu-
esque heroine leaves only a few rags on
the vamp when she is done with her. The
play is to be seen in Sydney at Hoyt’s and
the Strand.
Pleasing pencil work :
The S. Australian John 0. Goodchild may well
have taken it as a good augury for his' show of
drawings, lithographs and etchings at the Grosvenor
Galleries (Sydney) when he learned the other day
that he had been made a fellow of the Senefelder
Club of Lithography, of which Frank Brangwyn
is president. He is the only Australian to achieve
this distinction, and there is work in this little
exhibition which fully justifies the compliment.
Goodcliild does not worry about clouding his sky
backgrounds to any extent; -he gets his light effects
admirably, however, in such work as “Afternoon
Light” and “Light Through the Trees.” There is
nonthing more alluring in the litho. section than
“A Glimpse,” the picture of a wet, crowded London
street seen through an arched window. Those of
the etchings which show Sydney street scenes should
presently have a historic as well as an artistic value.
“Castlereagh-street” is a study of cranes and scaffold-
ing, while both the George-street and King-street
views preserve scenes that will be mightily changed
within a few' years. There is sound, painstaking
technique in Goodchiid s work which makes even
the pencil drawing of “The Rubbish Tip” worth
while.

K°yal is scrappy; there are times when
melodies and orchestration soar to close

upon the injured lass swears an oath to
make Arniaud fall in love with her and to
throw him over. She becomes a cabaret
dancer and carries out her plan according
to schedule, except that she also falls in
love—with the gentleman. Her oath rather
gets in the way of straight running,
but after the two young people have said a
few unpleasant things to each other, every-
thing comes right in the end. The play
is capitally staged, and the Spanish cos-
tumes mingle with the bizarre attire of the
gypsies in a riot of color. Marie Burke
is quite in the right setting as the heroine,
and Herbert Browne sings better than usual

as Armand Mirbeau. As Ilippolyt Galli-
pot, a professor gettiug data for' a book,
E. Barrett-Lennard does a bit of clever
female impersonation. Thelma Burness is
somewhat colorless as Dolly, the lass whom
Armand side-tracks: Cecil Kellaway is an
entertaining parent who gets humorously
drunk: Marie Eaton is a desirable gypsy
lass and Linda Foy presents a realistic
gypsy hag; Gaston Mervale makes a very
convincing Sebastiano. The dance given
by Thufza Rogers and partner Robert
Lascelles is an admirable bit of work which
causes the house to pass over the incongruity
of a dainty ballet number in a noisy cabaret.
Sylvia Miller and Robert Helpman are seen
in a well-danced tango, too, and the chorus
deserves a special word of praise for well-
rendered numbers.

An exotic item in one of the Heifetz con-
certs at Melbourne Auditorium last week
was a sonata for piano and violin by
Joseph Achron. brother of Isidor, the fiddler’s
solemn accompanist. Three of the move-
ments were crammed with brilliant persiflage
and abounded in the sort of riddle, which the
bow of the principal performer solves with
such amazing ease and nonchalance; but
the underlying thought, if it was there, was
difficult to follow. The second movement,
glorifying yokel amour, shone like a star
through the fireworks of the others and gave
promise of a future for the author, lie got
his theme by listening to a shepherd carol-
ling outside his window. This kind of lar-
ceny is so popular with composers that it is
a wonder that shepherds have never formed
a union to maintain their copyright. A
delightful experience of another programme
was the ICreutzer Sonata, whose color was
so richly painted by both violinist and accom-
panist that it was easy to imagine a wdiole
orchestra was in occupation of the stage.
Melbourne Repertory Society's perform-
ance of Pirandello’s “Six Characters in
Search of an Author” at the King’s was
helped by the sound, if husky, acting of
Gregan McMahon as the father and by the
ecstatic intensity of Dulcie Bland as the
stepdaughter. Oscar Behrend, the only other
member with much to say, was anxious that
nobody should miss his lines, and nobody
did. The grouping was good, and although
the stage was as crowded as a flypaper in a
country inn, the attention seldom strayed
from the six characters left half-finished by
their creator and compelled by the dynamic
force he put. into them to work out their
tragic destinies through a crowd of poor
actors assembled for a rehearsal of a con-
ventional comedy. A play in which, thank
goodness, there is no orchestra, some of the
performers wander on to the stage from the
auditorium and the curtain remains up dur-
ing the intervals is new to Melbourne, but
after some bewilderment she took to it and
applauded loudly. The Pirandello work re-
verses the usual rule. If it. is difficult to
read, it plays excellently, for the pill of
literary theorising is brilliantly coated with
workmanlike drama.
Audiences seem to renew their innocence
every time they re-enter a playhouse. Mel-
bourne King's thrilled to the simple auda-
cities of "Trilby*’ on Saturday night as if
Green Ilats had never been in fashion. Du
Manner was a humorous artist but he never
drew anything funnier than the horror of
Sandy, Tally and Little Killee on learning
that the model with the beautiful extremi-
iios had been posing in the nude. Lots of
artists in real life marry their models and
think no more of it, but "Trilby” re-
sembles real life about as much as the lime-
light resembles tin- sun. Moscovitch, how-
ever, is a line actor and his Svengali was a
giant, histrionically speaking, out of all pro-
portion to the rest of the mannikins that
went buffooning through the play. Me de-
served a better fate than Byrl Walkley as
the instrument of the Jew’s genius for music.

Ins hips and pushed himself resolutely
through the part of the bewhiskered Wynne,
and Reginald Newson was the lovelorn Wil-
liam Bagot. Beatrice Day and I>atrie Cur-
wen as the parental Bagots were the most
artistic and entertaining of the party, with
the exception of the star. Nat Madison—

otic fervor over an Australian film, and the
Athenaeum for “Outward Bound,” an excur-

last is the play, much discussed in London,
in which the passengers on an ocean liner
find that they are all dead and that the ship
is bound for the hereafter. If it is pro-
duced as well as it reads, it should be a
moneymaker for the Carrolls. Joseph Cun-

The Best Bank on Earth!
Queensland Afforestation Scheme
Every £5 Bond will be worth £ / 00.
Forestry experts are unanimous in predicting a gigantic timber famine within the next few years, owing to
neglect of afforestation during the past century. It is too late now to prevent the calamity. Within 20 years
America, China, Japan and other countries will have consumed their own forests, and will be clamoring for
timber supplies. Australia will be in the same plight. The Commonwealth is over six million acres short of the
forest area required to provide for its future timber needs.
Tree-planting is a Vital Need.
Queensland Forests, Ltd., has been established to regenerate, nurture, and mature growing timber on
existing forest lands, to create new forests, and to foster scientific, tree-planting within the State.
The Company has purchased select areas of timber in the Johnstone Rivers-Tableland districts of North
Queensland, convenient to ports, and accessible for road transport. This country is noted for its magnificent
growth of valuable softwoods, including oak, maple, cedar and pines, and has an average annual rainfall of
over 144 inches. Owing to its high moisture content it is practically fire-proof.
Thousand's of valuable trees are growing already, and expert foresters will be employed
to care for these and plant and cultivate other indigenous trees. Millable timber has been
taken off similar property in this territory at 10 years, and 20-year-old oak-trees have reached
a height of 100 feet and a girth of 9 £eet.
What the Public is Offered.
The Company will issue 18,000 £5 Bonds for each 3000 acres. Section “A” of the Company s property,
comprising 3000 acres, will be afforested immediately, and the cultivation of additional sections will follow
until a total area of 50,000 acres has been afforested. The Company will market the timber for bondholders,
commencing at the earliest suitable date after twelve years from June 1, 192 7. The Company will not be
released from its obligation to bondholders until the sum of £lOO net has paid for each £5 invested.
How the Public is Protected.
To safeguard the interests of Bondholders in every way possible, the Company instructed Messrs. Morris,
Fletcher and Cross, Solicitors, of Brisbane, to prepare the Bond and Trust Deed, and to have both documents
examined and settled by Mr. Charles Stumm, K.C. Bondholders will have the following security:—
1. The freehold title deeds of the land referred to in the Bond will be deposited with
the Public Curator as Trustee for the bondholders, who will lodge a caveat under the Real
Properties Act prohibiting the registration of any mortgage or other instrument against the
land until the bonds have been fully paid and satisfied.
2. Within one year the Company will commence cultivation of the property to which
the bonds refer, and within five years from the sale of the first bond 1 the whole area will be
regenerated and afforested according to the best principles of forestry. There are growing
on the property at the present moment thousands of young trees which will be carefully
nurtured. Many additional trees will be planted under the care of expert silviculturists.
With these facts in mind, investors will be able to appreciate the increased value of their
bond at the end of the first five years. The enhanced value of the land by reason of this
afforestation will increase materially year by year until the timber is marketed.
3. The Trustee will lock up one-third of all moneys paid by investors (in a special trust
fund) to ensure the maintenance and protection of the forest from the fifth year onward;
also to establish pulp mills, timber mills, or such other machinery as may be necessary to
ensure the marketing of the produce under conditions most favorable to bondholders.
4. The Company must pay to the Public Curator the net proceeds received in con-
nection with the marketing of the Forest Products, and the Trustee will distribute the
amount among the bondholders.
5. Out of the net proceeds of the forest produce bondholders are entitled to receive
from the Trustee sums from time to time until an aggregate amount of £lOO for each £5 has
been paid to the bondholders, after which the bond shall be deemed fully paid and satisfied
and cancelled.
6. The Trust Deed gives power to the Trustee to take possession of the whole of the
land, and to sell the land and timber, and produce thereof, for the benefit of bondholders in
the event of default by the Company or any of its covenants, conditions, agreements, or
provisions.
7. After the Company has fulfilled all its obligations to all bondholders of the section,
and not before, the Trustee will release the land, which will then revert to the Company

“Adsum” : The Waterside Workers’ Federa-
tion is becoming the worst enemy that Aus-
tralian industry has. Wharf laborers loading
sleepers in (Jroperland ports limit a sling
to 21. When those sleepers get to Durban
the sling’s load increases to 4t); and at Dela-
goa Bay it jumps to 70. Westralian saw-

“(J. Coral” : Trochus shell, used for making
“pearl” buttons and the like, maintains a
fair price and helps to keep the pot boiling
Torres Strait way. Though a good deal is
picked up on the reef at low tide, much is
got by diving. It’s an art to know when and
where to search. Most of the luggers that
used to work mother-o’-pearl shell are on
trochus until the shell market takes a jump
again.

“Uramao”: South Otago (M.L.) farmers
are nibbling at the notion of sugar-beet.
They’ve been collecting facts from Moray-
shire, Scotland, where Lord Weir has
linanced a large-scale sugar-beet experiment,
and M a lira (Vic.). The ridge land in South
Otago should give as good a return as the
Mall'ra country, and -plenty of it can be
bought at £8 and £9 an acre.

interesting and shuddersome comparisons of
beef prices on the London market. Per

“Two Seas”: The N.S.W. Railway Depart-
ment is very lax in the matter of the travel-
ling permits issued for stock sent by rail. In
too many cases when the stock arrive at
their destination the permit, which is sup-
posed to be on the train, is not available.
Then the consignee has to pay the travelling
charges a second time and the drover has to
chance being hauled up by the police for
travelling stock without a permit.
* * * *
“Jumbuck”: If Yorkshire’s faith in Free-
trade isn’t weakening it ought to be. In the
first three months of this year 11,289,000
square yards of woollen fabrics and
5.151,0001 b. of yarns were imported into the
British Isles, and for a year or more York-
shire millmen have been very limited pur-
chasers of wool in Australia. It would pro-
bably pay many of them to ship their
machinery, lock, stock and barrel, to Aus-
tralia and enjoy the prosperity possible
behind a strong Protective tariff.
“Kriz”: What becomes of the great
schemes of the Yankee investigators who
visit Broome every now and then and talk
so expansively ? A little while ago one of
these gents said his company was going to
spend £70,000 in a fish- and turtle-canning
business somewhere on the nor’-west coast.
American scientists were going to harness
the tides, a big ship was to be specially
built to suit the coast, over 200 men were
to be employed—for a start —in the fac-
tory ashore and so on and so forth. But
old shellbacks who bought the investigator
many drinks on the strength of promised
possies still wait on the pub verandah for
their dreams to come true.
“Louis Gunn”: “I-luffiu-Guffin’s” mention
of the leakage between the grower and con-
sumer opens up a vital subject. The grower
is constantly bewailing the leakage, but
seldom does anything to overcome it. The
growers of berry fruits at Silvan and Mon-
bulk (Vic.), however, solved the problem
seven years ago, where they put into effect
a plan of direct trading. At the time they
were below the bread-line with strawberries
at 2Jd. per pound, but arc now on a good
wicket with the same fruit at 7Jd. per
pound. And they are still unable to cope
with the demand. The welfare of Australian
primary industries is in the hands of the
producers, and they can put their jobs on a
sound basis just whenever they take the
trouble to do so. At present, the middleman
is a necessary evil, but the growers of pro-
duce could, and should, reduce the evil to a
negligible factor.
* * * *
“L. 1.”: Despite the absence of water-
power, Vic. is making great strides in electri-
fication. In 1922 the State Electricity Com-
mission distributed 44,G25 kilowatts about the
city and country side; this year it has
reached 85,500 k.w., and the Sugarloaf-Rubi-
con system is being laid on an expectation
of 94,000 k.w. in 1925. The juice produced
out of the brown coal deposits at Yallourn
is replacing the old oil engine that lighted
country towns, and cow-farmers who have a
stream adjacent use it to drive a portable
pumping plant to irrigate their lucerne
patches. It won’t be long before the big
steel towers that carry the transmission lines
are straddled over every closely-settled
district.
“Borom”: The cost of smuggling an
Asiatic into Australia is about £75; only a
small portion has to be paid by the migrant,
the balance being found by the employer to
whom he is assigned. After he has landed,
one of the smuggling ring’s reps, takes charge
of him and delivers him to the employer, gener-
ally by motor. Then the immigrant has to
work for nothing for from three months to
a year to wipe off the cost of landing him
in the country, any disinclination to com-
plete this bondage being negatived by a
threat to_ let _ the authorities know where
he is; this, reinforced by harrowing descrip-
tions of Australian gaols, is generally suffi-
cient to quell mutiny. Prohibited immigrants
are also taught a smattering of English and
something about the country in which they
are supposed to have been living for more
than 20 years, so that in the event of sus-
picions being aroused they can tell a reason-
able story about their antecedents, while
there is always available a swarm of wit-
nesses to back them up.

“Hamfat”: John Drew, dead in San
Francisco, is recorded as having acted for
40 years under only two managements—for
17 years under Augustin Daly, who secured
the young man when he had been only two
years on the stage, and for 23 years with
Charles Frohinan. It was at the Asch-street
theatre in Philadelphia, conducted by his
mother and father, both competent actors,
that bis early stage life was spent. Drew
was regarded as America’s ablest Shaks-
peareau actor. At 73 he was playing in
"Trolawny of the Wells” when Death’s
curtain-call came.
“Hamfat”: The rediscovery of the couti-
lry-town harvest to be reaped with a well-
advertised metropolitan show seems likely
to lead to a rush. “White Cargo” was the
feeler; now a company to do “Abie’s Irish
Rose” is following the No. 2 Musical Comedy
Co. which took out “Katja” and “Kissing
Time.” The profits that have been gathered
have prompted the Firm to stop even the
Gilbert and Sullivan Co., which has been
playing a week at Newcastle, for one-night
shows at Armidale, Toowoomba and Ipswich,
on its way to Brisbane. This mopping-up of
country towns will make things harder for
travelling theatrical companies without
metropolitan advertisement; but it will give
some better jobs to a number of local actors.
“Woods Green” (Loud.) : Nazimova has
returned to London after 22 years, and is
telling people that Ellen Terry gave her
her first lessons in English. She learned the
language in five months after reaching New
York —she had to, fojr Lee Shubert bad
guaranteed her a leading part. I saw her
in Chicago in “Little Eyolf”; and after
playing in “Bella Donna” she escaped to
“C.C.”: Before each number violinist
Heifetz and his pianist, Achron, indulge in
a little tuning-up contest of three notes,
and, whether they know it or not, they have
selected an air w T hich has a clear and appro-
priate message to an Australian audience.
It says, “I’m coming, I’m coming!” It is
the chorus to “Ole Black Joe.”
“The Old Adam”: Local mummers cher-
ished the hope that there would be plenty
of work offering when the Sydney Empire
management started. But “Sunny” was cast
mainly with imported principals, and it will
be the same with “The Student Prince.”
Yet Australian performers were the out-
standing hits of the Gilbert and Sullivan
season and hold their own in current musi-
cal shows.
“El Wahabi”: A movie audience in Mos-
lem Delhi has been with difficulty restrained
by troops from smashing up the projector
and burning the theatre. The film objected
to was “The Moon of Israel,” dealing with
the Hebrew exodus from Egypt. Perhaps
Moslem feelings were outraged by the depic-
tion of Moses, who holds a place of high
esteem in Islamic traditions, or the producer
may have presented the Egyptian task-
masters as Mahomedans. People that showed
a herd of high-bred Herefords among the
Israelitish cattle in the exodus in “The Ten
Commandments” wouldn’t boggle at a trifle
like that.
“Curtain Raiser”: Melbourne’s latest
musical discovery is a young man who has
gained the free trip to Europe offered by
the Orient-Co. to promising ’Varsity stu-
dents. He is a very fine pianist, but if
he fulfils expectations one wonders how he
will return. One can’t imagine a world-
famous virtuoso by the name of Biggins.
“T.P.0’0.”: The failure of “The Blue
Mazurka” in London will make perplexities
for the Firm. As London failures are rarely
tried at this end, if Gladys Moncrieff re-
turns —very doubtful now—it will be hard
to find anything new that requires a singer
of quality. J.C.W.. Ltd., might well experi-
ment with a Moncrieff repertoire co. in view
of the G. and S. success. “Dorothy,” “Ma
Mie Rosette” and the like would do well with
Gladys in the lead, especially as good support
is available here.
H. C. L(INGERIE).
THE ARTIST: “I shouldn’t think you would get much work sitting only for costume.”
THE MODEL: “No, I suppose I shall have to sit nude soon. Dad says business is so
bad he can’t keep me in clothes much longer.”
the films. At the Coliseum the afternoon I
was there the audience was pitifully small;
but about Nazimova there can be no ques-
tion. She is a wonderful little creature,
and her stage art has not suffered from film
technique.
“M.C.T.”: Talbot Smith, The Bulletin’s
old-established critic in Adelaide, had an un-
expected experience at Bournemouth (he and
Mrs. Smith are spending this year in re-
visiting Europe). They were sunning them-
selves when a slim young man, also sunning
himself, joined their group. Soon he had
picked out Talbot Smith and his wife as
Australians, and, after learning of “S.T.S.’s”
connection with the Adelaide Repertory and
The Bulletin and talking of things in gen-
eral, moved on. Next day came an invita-
tion to tea with ILR.H. the Prince of Wales.
He was staying for a few days in Bourne-
mouth, strictly incog., and had not been
recognised.
“Cine Ma”: Those who still follow the
celluloid wraith of Rudolph Valentino in
his amours here below will be glad to hear
that the spirit of the gifted sheik is still
actively engaged in good works in the life
beyond. Miss Rambova, one of his several
wives on earth, has informed the press that
she has been in constant communication
with him since he passed over, and that he
is preparing for his debut as an actor by
attending lectures at the temples of know-
ledge scattered about between the stars. Un-
fortunately, there are no motion pictures
there, only morality plays. The lady doesn't
state whether Rudolph has taken a spirit
wife or been involved in a million-dollar
breach of promise case, but as Conan Doyle
says the next world is a replica of this,
only more beautiful, one can but hope for the
best.
“Curtain Raiser”: May 1 ask the Taits,
T :he Gravestocks and the Carrolls why they
don’t pay as much regard to the staging of
a Heifetz or a Paderewski as the vaudeville
managements do t:o the presentation of
American comedians? Even Herb Williams
gets a soft spotlight thrown on him and
does his stuff in front of a cracked painting
of King William-street, Adelaide, in the
early days. The excuse may be that great
art needs no adventitious aids; but Heifetz
sounds no better for having a riddle of
black shadows flung over his face by the
glaring lights above him ; and the spectacle
of him scuttling for shelter like a scared
chicken under the wing of an immense and
tawdry curtain doesn’t help. The stage be-
hind him being packed with people, Chalia-
pin sang at Melbourne Auditorium to the
accompaniment of nose-wiping and shingle-
combing. One old chap, apparently suffering
from the Malay disease of latah, faithfully
reproduced his every gesture.
“Curtain Raiser”: Although scribes who
believe that the art of the drama died with
Ooppin treated the revival of “East Lynne”
in Melbourne with solemn respect, the pub-
lic refused to take the ancient weeper seri-
ously, or even to flock to it to any great
degree. The critics and the management
forgot the influence of the movies on the
public taste. The more action and the less
talk there is in melodrama the better it
goes. When the Lady Isabel strikes an
attitude and says “Take me away, Francis
Levison ; I care not who shall be the instru-
ment of my rebellion,” the house guffaws.
Also the silent bellowdrama goes forward in
the ornate palaces of millionaires, whereas
the stage variety still sticks to the scenery
in which the old stone fireplace and the
book-shelves oscillate for 10 minutes when
somebody slams a door.
“Caesar’s Ghost” : On his last tour of these
parts Harry Lauder bored people with his
habit of interlarding his entertainment with
sermons about mother’s love, man’s duty to
his wife and Imperial sentiments, but people
were too polite to object—the Australian
audience, under inflictions, is almost pain-
fully polite. In Birkenhead, England, how-
ever, Lauder recently got the “bird.” He
had sung a song about the dole, but made
the mistake of thinking that the audience
wanted to hear his personal views about it.
Still, Lauder’s experience was not so un-
happy as that of George Robey, whose effort
to deliver a fervent patriotic speech at a
fete in London at the end of the war (I
was there) was popularly regarded as his
greatest joke. If a man who lias made
himself famous by his red nose on the vaude-
ville stage is fatuous enough to consider his
political or other opinions worth serious
expression, it is better to be taken seriously
and hissed than merely laughed at.
“I. Phelps”: Now that Warde Morgan has
recovered the Firm has been monotonously
proclaiming him as the young man who made
the miraculous escape from the railway
accident. It may be good publicity to ex-
ploit public sympathy, but it seems indecent
and uncomplimentary to a good artist and
a good fellow. It reminds me of one occa-
sion when a Melbourne lady introduced me
to an eminent novelist as “the writer, you
remember, who had that remarkable whit-
low on his finger.”
“W. Spokeshave”: Lithuania lias banned
the sale of the works of Shakspeare, among
others, as being immoral; and Shakspeareans
are indignant about it. One noted authority
lectures the Lithuanians for their squeamisb-
ness; yet I am positive he has never heard
an unexpurgated performance of, say, “Troi-
lus and Cressida” or “Measure for Measure,"
nor ever will. And I am willing to bet a
level fiver that he is not game to recite in
public the second scene. Act IV, of “Pericles,
or even chosen bits of “Itomeio and Juliet.
Lithuania is really more consistent than our-
selves in proclaiming William immoral, in
the sense that he calls a spade a spade.
What the Bard would think of our morality,
as exemplified in our movies, < drama and
novels, is a gee-gee of another tint.
“Ashmead”: Australia’s king of march-
composers, Alex. F. Lithgow, despite Ins
severe malady, turns up at practice and wields
the baton evety week for the St. Joseph’s
band in Launceston (Tas.), the oldest band
in Australia. Two years ago he presented a
programme embracing marches, suites, inter-
mezzos and songs, every note having come
from his own pen. The colossal work
of composition and arrangement had involved
over 1000 sheets of manuscript, all done in
about three months, and in his spare time
(lie is a printer by trade). The strain of
his present illness lias caused him to resign
the conductorship of the Launceston (,011-
cert Orchestra, which he created a couple ot
years ago. Launceston is now organising
a complimentary concert in his honor.
“M. 8.” (Lond.) : Una Bourne is another
Australian who suffers from too much
•modesty; and she won’t hear of a press
agent. I think few of her countrymen
realise that among piano-players making
records for the gramophone she and Percy
Grainger are easily first of the Australians.
She is to give another London recital this
month (June).
“T.R.H.”: About 18 years ago Frank
Neil, Bill Ayr, Tom Murray, Amy Sherwood,
Venie Linden and myself helped 0. J. Cole,
of Cole’s Bohemians (B. 30/6/’27), to make
one of the first pictures ever turned out in
Aussie. The co. was then playing in a
marquee across Princes Bridge in Melbourne.
Most of the co. lived in caravans. The
Bohemians, now known as Cole’s Dramatic
Players, are still going strong under the
management of W. H. Ayr. Robert Inman
is one of the co. The film referred to a
bank robbery, and there was a long ride
through the bush and a lot of shooting.
Path 6 Fr&res were the photographers.
“J.C.”: Bland Holt's motor-car leap in
the municipal theatre at Oamaru (M.L.)
should be recorded. The co.’s arrival co-
incided with the advent of the first car, a
noisy beast and recalcitrant, and Bland hired
the contraption to enhance his entrance in
the racecourse scene of “The Derby Winner.
The entrance went big as he threshed Ins
way in low gear to mid-stage. Then, missing
neutral, he threw her into _ high. The
machine took off at the footlights, snatched
the baton from the conductor’s hand as it
cleared the orchestra and crashed in the
orchestral stalls. Holt escaped injury, but
the juggernaut was badly bent, and the
doghouse player developed a permanent tre-
molo in his notes. The audience was never
in danger because in canny Oamaru it always
sits well back —in the pit.
“Philm TTp” : When “Ben Hur,” now draw-
ing the crowd as a picture, was originally
done as a stage play in Sydney, Conway Tearle.
long a movie leading man, was the hero. A
later revival of the piece proved very suc-
cessful at Melbourne Theatre Royal, the
! lead being Eric Maxon. The present pie-
: ture version was directed by another old
theatrical acquaintance. Fred Niblo, who.

ART IS LONG.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Most of tlie dancers wore fancy dress, and it was
obvious tliat (bey had encountered difficulties, for
it is difficult to be daring in this age of short skirts.”
—Melbourne Anuus on the Artists’ Hall.
It was my friend MacAdemy,
Who daubs in lurid oils.
And “Mac,” I said, "’tis plain to see
Grief hath you in her toils.
“Ah. tell me, Mac,” I murmured then,
“The measure of your pain ; •
’Tis more than the faint praise of men
That damns your works as vain;
“’Tis more than any landlord’s bill,
Since that I know you scorn ;
’Tis more than any maid’s ill-will
That finds you so forlorn.”
He raised to me a stricken face
And winked his misted eyes,
As strong men weep who feel disgrace
In tears they mayn't disguise.
“Ah. woe is me! that I should live
(’Twere better to have died)
To see a world we cannot give
A shock to,” he replied.
“Ah, woe! To think how far we fall—
No more a Grundy faints
At sights we show her at the ball;
The life a Murger paints.
“No more may horrify the prim,
No more the Press bewail,
Some pagan and denuded limb,
Where modern skirts prevail.
“Ah, woe ! No more a world undrest
At ‘daring nudes’ can laugh—
Mrs longa, tunica brevis esf
Will be our epitaph!”
It was my friend MacAdemy,
And 0I1 ! Ins plight was drear—
To think that I should live to see
Poor Mac refuse a beer!

THERE is no part of the British Empire that is entirely self-
dependent. Should danger arise to any one of our common-
wealth of nations, we spring to its help without waiting for a
call. The Home Country has good reason indeed to be proud
and thankful that this is so.
Just as in private life we hnow that we can depend on each
other in times of trouble. What we sometimes overlook is
that we are just as inter-dependent in times of peace. Alone,
no one of us is self-sufficient. Together this Empire has the
resources, the materials, the men and the money to stand
foursquare. The strength of the Empire lies in Empire Trade.
Let us foster it whenever and wherever it is possible.
In the field of engineering Armstrong Whitworth have set
a standard of quality, of value and of integrity to the whole
world. There is no branch of engineering from raw material
to finished product, from drills to dock equipment, from
lighting sets to locomotives, that Armstrong Whitworth
do not undertake. And these services, these products are
offered on terms, which, value for value, compete with
anything the world can offer.
We are proud to serve the world. But best of all we like
to serve the Empire.

[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
THE track to school led down a hill
And crossed a little, wooden bridge
That spanned a creek, then climbed until
It reached a thickly-timbered ridge.
Two miles it stretched from farm to school,
Two wondrous miles of sun and shade,
With here and there a wayside pool
O’er which brown she-oaks drooped and
swayed.
Far other tracks my feet have found
Since, book in hand and bag on back,
A happy youngster schoolward bound
Long, long ago I trod that track.
Far other tracks I’ve trod since then,
Tracks rough and smooth, tracks dark
and lit;
But never shall I tread again
A way so wonderful as it.
With ne’er a trouble to distress
1 trod its length with footsteps free.
Alone, I knew not loneliness;
For I had splendid company.
While by the way, leaves wet with dew,
Bright beads of dew, the wild hops
gleamed,
Down avenues of misty blue
I glimpsed far groves and glades that
dreamed.
As slanting lances through green leaves
Pricked blade and frond with points of
gold,
Such dreams were mine as Fancy weaves
Ere yet the world makes Fancy old.
Birds piping out their morning song
Told me of regions, strange and wide,
While, tall and straight, like warriors
strong,
The trees stood ever at my side.
Tall warrior trees! Beneath an arch
Of cloudless blue —-heads in the air—
They seemed as though upon a march
Somewhere, somewhere.... I wondered
where!
And I saw shapes, wood-shapes like those
Men saw of old in forests green,
Lone-walking there at day’s red close,
Or when dawn-light made rich the scene.
At times, down leafy aisles I viewed —
Wliite-shouldered and with gleaming knee—•
A nymph who, still and unpursued,
Pretended to be but a tree.
By all around me held and spelled
At times, behind a grass-tree clump
A hiding dryad I beheld
Disguised and fashioned as a stump.
And I heard song—song never heard
In any wood by stream or sea —
Song lifted by no mortal bird,
Song thrilled and filled with fantasy.
Thus, thus by rock and log and pool
With trees and ferns on either hand,
The track to school led not to school
So much as on to Fairyland.

Realities.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
OLD Mary, Binghi’s gin, was used to
facing realities. When the sun was
120 in the shade, as it often, was on
the blistering mulga plains, she had no time
for rest. It was then her duty to go to the
water-store and fill a vessel for Marks, who
was working in the mine. She would tramp
stolidly in her' bare feet, clad in some un-
lovely calico stuff that stuck to her body and
was smeared with sweat. It was always
the same. From the mine she could hear
Marks’s rich oaths ; to the left, in the poor
shade of a mulga bush, lay her lord and
master Binghi, brushing away flies with a
lazy hand.
Lowering the bucket was a ticklish busi-
ness. It was always attended by incident,
for, though he could not be seen, Marks
was able to make himself heard. He was a
big man—over six feet high—with a black
beard and staring blue eyes. His savage
manners made him impossible company, even
for outcast whites; and the harshness of
life under a desert sun had unhinged his
mind. It was his obsession that he would
strike it rich and to that end he worked pro-
digiously. Descending the mine at seven in
the morning he toiled without stop until
late afternoon, except for a spell at midday,
when Mary gave him his tea and damper.
Though she tried to he careful, the old gin
could not prevent the bucket from bumping
against the walls of the shaft and dislodging
pebbles, which showered on Marks’s bare
skin. Marks wore only trunks when below.
He sang and swore to himself all day. The
impact of his pick against the rock kept
time monotonously with the invisible ham-
mers driving on his brain. At five, when
the sun was dropping, Binghi and Mary
pulled him to the surface. It was a hard
pull, exacting from the natives every ounce
of their strength. Neither could have man-
aged it alone.
“Binghi,” said Marks one day, “you get-
tum water, and gettum quick.”
“Right, boss,” said Binghi, and he walked
away.
Old Mary never liked those excursions of
Binghi’s to the water-hole. The water-hole
was twenty miles away and to reach it
Binghi had to take the camel. Usually he
did not return until evening. It was the
camel that _ Mary feared. She mistrusted
the animal’s eyes-—the fixed glances it
always gave Binghi. Mary was not versed
in the classics, but the elemental things—
hunger, thirst, passion, revenge—were facts
she understood very well. Binglii had been
cruel —and camels never forgot.
It made her shudder a little to watch
Phil squatting in the sand plain, regardless
of heat, and Binglii near by, torpid under
the mulga bush. The camel’s eyes were
hard, his ugly body tense with his hate,
lie was waiting, waiting. And Mary would
avert her troubled eyes. Binglii snored on,
making vague passes in liis sleep. It never
occurred to him to be frightened of Phil.
“Me afraid ! No dam’ fear,” was his reply
to Mary’s persistent warnings. He was a
typical black —lazy, shiftless, stupid. To
him existence was not a complicated affair;
a patch of mulga, some damper, sleep, and
lie was content.
Mary saw Binglii ride away gross and
clumsy on the camel’s back, lie had been
her man for thirty years. It was another
blazing day. There was not a breath of
air, and the mulga looked desolate and
scorched. Large boulders were visible some
distance from the camp, white in the sun,
glaring like a baleful Stonehenge. The sky
was hard and the vast lands bare and
hostile.
Marks lounged over, clad only in a pair
of trunks. His body and arms were no
longer sunburnt, but ebony. He watched
Binghi’s receding form, the water-vessels on
either side of him flashing like great suns.
The camel pad wound to the right and
was lost amongst boulders and scrub.
Binglii went to the waterhole every second
day, and every fortnight he took Phil to
Peak Hill to procure their stores. Peak
Hill was 70 miles away. Marks was obliged
to trust the black; if anything happened to
Binglii, or if he deserted, the game was up
—without water death would come quick.
“If he wastes too much time this trip I'll
cut the hide off him,” Marks said aloud for
Mary’s benefit.
The gin stood like a figure cut in stone,
her eyes on the spot where Binglii dis-
appeared. She was very old and very ugly.
Her voice came harsh and troubled.
“That camel bad feller —kill Binglii.”
Marks tried to spit—lris mouth was dry.
He was hot, hot as hell! The sun was
burning through him. burning into him, and
he longed for the shade of the mine. He
spoke slowly, with some difficulty.
“If Binglii turns his back Phil will get
him, kill him, Mary. Tear him alive.” His
eyes gleamed. “He better not turn his
back! It’s the end of us if he does. There’s
no water.”
It seemed to Mary that the day would
never end. She had a queer feeling that
something would happen to Binglii. Binglii
was often brutal —even kicked her ;, yet she
did not mind that. They quarrelled, but
something deeper than human pride kept
them together. It happened occasionally
that Binglii would steal some kangaroo meat
when Mary's back was turned. That meant
a shortage—a beating from Marks. “Bad
feller, Binglii,” Mary would scream and
chase him across the plain. She could never
catch him, and, out of breath, would turn
back muttering angrily, “Bad feller, Binglii,
bad feller, Binglii.” The sun blazed sav-
agely during these altercations —-it was an
eternal witness. But Mary had no time for
the abstract. The meat was gone, and the
boss would be- angry. She would blame
Binglii and Marks would beat them both to
avoid the possibility of mistake. The dirty
tent —the sand —the neat. These she saw
and felt, but they had no significance. Her
life was made up of realities. Only a limited
number of things were concrete —the mine;
Binglii; Marks ; Phil the camel.
Marks was quiet that day, and the heat
rolled over the camp in visible, blinding
waves. Mary found herself missing the
songs, for Marks had a magnificent baritone
voice which often soothed her. He sang
many songs, scraps of indescribably filthy
things picked up in the saloons of Kalgoorlie
and many queer camps. Mary was not
squeamish, but there were times when the
vileness of the white man’s tongue made her
shudder. To her native mind Marks was an
enigma—restless and savage, flinging away
youth for common bits of rock that had no
apparent value.
At midday she sent down the usual damper
and the last drops of water. Twice 1 the
bucket knocked against the sides and she
trembled a little in anticipation of the other’s
abuse.
“Hell!” was all that Marks said. His
voice came low and tense, with a musical
ring remarkable in such surroundings, and
a few minutes afterwards she heard his pick
crashing into the rock. Marks worked like
a demon that afternoon, the beat of his pick
coming from below, sharp and vehement, as
if madly racing to keep time with the seconds.
Lolling under the mulga Mary sensed a
strangeness in the day. For a change she
felt the heat acutely. There was no water
now and she rolled and sweated, keenly alive
to great physical discomfort and the ominous
things the day seemed to portend. That bad-
feller Phil! ' With the unerring fatalism of
her race she knew that Phil would kill
Binghi, and the certainty of her conviction
made her uncommonly sad and helpless.
Closing her eyes to escape the pitiless heat,
she saw, in a flash of vision she had never
had before, Binghi on the ground and Phil
towering over him. The expressions of the
two fascinated her. There was intense hate
in the camel’s eyes. His head darted for-
ward at the prostrate black and Binghi’s
hands moved instinctively to protect his face.
Phil’s great jaws opened, closed on Binghi’s
left hand, wrenched it away. The fear in the
native’s face came vividly to Mary—she saw
deep terror that made Binghi pitiful and
almost ashen. The camel’s hoof shot out,
viciously smashing into the man’s features
as if it had been a hammer. Binghi was
unconscious—bloody. Phil’s savage jaws were
tearing and biting at his face.
“Mary! Mary!”
The old gin came to with a start. She
was trembling violently, sweat was running
down her face. She looked round. The
same heat; the same desolation. There was
no sign of Binghi.
“Mary ! Mary ! Get me out. Gold ! I’ve
found gold!”
It was Marks calling, shrieking at the top
of his voice. The words came clear in the
great stillness of the day. Pie was yelling
like a maniac.

“What’s up, boss?” said Mary, peering
over the top. The man below was tugging
furiously at the windlass and hundreds of
stones were tumbling down the mine upon
his shoulders, arms and legs.
“Gold! I’m richer than Midas!” came his
words. “Found it at last! Pull me up.”
Mary seized the rope and pulled, but could
make no impression. She had let Marks
down, but it was a different matter getting
him up. Site released her hold, the man
dropping hack to the bottom of the shaft.
Hi- cursed horribly.
“Binghi not come hack, boss,” cried Mary.
“You too heavy. You wait him come back.”
It was then about half-past three. The
earth was still an intolerable, scorching place.
Mary returned to the mulga; she could do
nothing, and it affected her queerly to stand
at the pit’s mouth listening to Marks’s crazy
oaths. She felt a strange impatience of
Marks, as if he were a clamoring, futile
man in the bitter scheme of the universe.
She would have to wait until Binghi returned
• —and her intuitions had been telling her all
day that he would not come back.
The moon was coming up when Mary saw
the outlines of a camel approaching the
boulders from the eastern end. There was a
man on its back, and her sharp eyes made
out Binglii’s familiar figure. She felt: unut-
terable relief, the anxieties of that long,
trying day lifting from her mind in a
moment. Binghi was about MOO yards away
and she laughed throatily as she recognised
his careless scat.
She lumbered to the shaft. “Binghi coming
now, boss. Him all right. Him pull you
up.”
Marks, delirious, raving in the fashion of
a child, cried: “Get me up. I’ve got gold.
I'm richer than Midas. I'll pay anything.”
“AH right, boss,” said Mary equably.
The man’s voice puzzled her. It was no
longer pleasant, but high-pitched and harsh.
Binghi was coming to the depression in
the plain where there had once been a river.
With a sudden intake of breath Mary saw
Phil stumble, go down on his kners. Taken
unawares Binghi fell, and her heart beat
faster as she saw him roll down the embank-
ment into the hollow below. Phil was up at
once, alert, like some monstrous Nemesis,
advancing towards Binghi.
The moon was high, flooding the miserable
land with light; the boulders, white by day,
were gleaming pallidly as if witnesses of the
unusual. The stars came out. All that
Mary could see was the camel—Phil, striking
and darting, his ungainly body white under
the moon.
It was over when Mary reached Binghi.
Binghi lay on his side, the back of his head
and liis face frightfully battered and torn.
It was evident that to protect himself he
had rolled on his chest but had been turned
over by the camel. The ashen light of even-
ing lit his face up cruelly.
Mary bent over the man, neither repelled
nor frightened by what she saw. Her life
was made up of realities. There was little
she could say.
Some wind sprang up, giving fresh life to
the sinister outlines of the place. The mulga
looked grey and there was coolness and peace.
Marks, the prisoner, still was screaming.
He was quite mad now, flinging to the night
in his cracked voice some obscene fragment
about a maid of Spain. Mary, dry-eyed,
beside her mate, in the river-bed, moaned
again and again, “Bad feller Binghi, hud
feller Binghi.”
V. C. WRIGHT.
The Ordinary Seaman.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
IT was amongst, the Islands that the lad
took sick, lie wasn't exactly what one
would call sea-going, anyway, and the
New Hebrides were full of fever that voyage.
He was just a boy, with a year's deck experi-
ence and a head full of ambition. For two
days lie lay in his bunk, white as a piece of
sailcloth and not eating a thing. The
steward fancied it was sea-sickness and made
tilings out of eggs and lemons which the
lad couldn't swallow. Then, the third day,
the steward said the case was beyond him
and called the mate, who knew something of
medicine, and he said it was fever. He
went to his state-room and read it up, and
when he came out said the lad must have
expert medical attention within a day or he
would die. The ship was directly off the
coast of Fiji and half a day from Suva.
“We’d better put in there, sir,” the mate
told the Old Man. “The lad must see a
doctor.”
The skipper, lean, lantern-jawed, brought
his teeth together with a snap. “What!” lie
bellowed. "Are you out of your senses,
mister, that you propose putting into port
for a sailor with the bellyache?”
The crew was not surprised. It would
have been a miracle had that hard-slielled
old sea-crab gone out of his way for a whole
shipful of sick men, let alone a seaman who
not even carried an A.B.'s ticket. The
captain wanted to make a record voyage.
There would be a bonus in it for him and a
bettor standing with the steamship company.
Hadn’t he refused to take on fresh fruit for
the crew at the beginning of the voyage, and
given the cook a dressing-down for sending
pies to the fo’c’s’le? Economy—that was
hi;; watchword.
It was a sullen crew aft that day. The
men did their work grudgingly, and talked
of mutiny. But the Old Man paced the
quarter-deck and pretended not to see it.
Now and then lie would clap his glasses to
his eyes, sweep the horizon ahead, and then
rub his hands together while his eyes lit with
a gold gleam of satisfaction as the vessel
leaped beneath him.
In the fo’c’s’le the lad was growing worse.
He was babbliug now about the little farm
where he was born. His face was no longer
white, hut a flaming red, and he grew to
tossing so that the crew took turns holding
him so he wouldn’t roll out of his bunk.
The next morning the mate went to the
Old Man again. “The lad’s burning up, sir,”
he said. “We can still make Suva in time.”
“Foolishness,” snapped the old man. “Fool-
ishness. I’ve seen sick sailors before. You
can’t kill them. The man will he all right
by the time we make Wellington.”
“Still” persisted the mate.
“Mister,” said the Old Man, and his eyes
were as cold as the scales of a wet fish,
“remember that as an officer of this vessel
you re. supposed to assist iu delivering the
cargo promptly!”
The mate came away. He knew it was
hopeless. The Old Man had but one idea.
The life or death of a common sailor was
nothing compared with the ship’s efficiency
in making a voyage.
The wireless-operator tried if. too, for a
radio man has considerable latitude in inter-
course with his skipper.
“Wish you'd put in port, sir,” he said.
“That lad is sick. Besides, I’m feeling a
bit queer myself. Think it's rheumatism.”
The Old Man didn't say a word, but just
looked with those cold, grey eyes of his.
Sparks read his answer and smiled faintly.
Then lie turned and walked off with a drag
to his step.
So the boat pounded on through the purple
sea, full steam ahead, driven to her last
atom by that hard-faced old fanatic who
paced the quarter-deck and delighted in the
possibility of a record trip. And off the
port stern glimmered dimmer and dimmer
the faint blue streak where Fiji and Suva
faded. It would delay and spoil everything
to stop there; the vessel would perhaps be
quarantined, money would have to be spent,
the owners would “call” the captain—an
ordinary seaman was not worth that!
It was the bos’u who first saw the cloud
—a dirty, yellow smudge that sneaked along
the horizon like an animal bent on some
deviltry. He wagged his head in trepidation,
and recalled the fate of the Sulu Maid in
those same seas. But the crew wouldn’t let
him talk of shipwreck. What with the sick
lad aft and that unhealthy cloud there was
depression enough aboard.
The mate was worried, too. As the baro-
meter dropped steadily lie gave orders to
clear the deck. Meanwhile the Old Man
paced the bridge and ’phoned down to the
engineer to crowd her to the limit, and a
little beyond that.
The hurricane broke with great, suddenness.
It seemed to rise up out of the sea, drop
from the sky and close in on all sides at;
once.
And this was no ship to weather a hurri-
cane such as blew that day. She was small,
and loaded light, which was bad. The storm
made a toy of her.
Two hours later she went on a reef. The
officers rang for reverse, the screw propeller
strained, and she backed off, leaking, but still
afloat, although now she could make but slow
headway.
The storm began to die as quickly as it
was born, and the skipper expressed hope.
“It's easy enough, mister,” he told the mate.
“We can make the coast and call some
vessel to meet us there. With a tow we can
get in and save the ship. Tell the wireless
operator to call help.”
The mate sent the second officer to the
operator’s cabin. In a few minutes he was
back, looking queer.
“Sparks is in his bunk, sir,” he reported,
“and can’t move nor talk.”
The mate, went down and examined the
operator, who lay white and stiff, but alive.
The first officer's face was sober as lie
reached the captain. "I’m afraid, sir,” he
said, “those rheumatic twinges Sparks com-
plained of”
“What is it?” snapped the skipper, im-
patiently.
“It's a paralytic stroke, sir,” said the
mate. “The man is helpless.”
The ship was beginning fo list now. The
chief engineer had full steam ahead, but she
was settling fast and making slower head-
way.
The skipper gripped the operator and
shook him, Me was frightened—frightened
for his ship. It. was written in his face.
“It. is no use, sir,” declared the mate.
“I've seen paralytics before. He’ll not
recover for weeks, maybe never.”
The sailors were crowding about, the door.
One of them spoke. “The lad aft was study-
in’ wireless when lie shipped this voyage,”
he said, “and was within a month of getting
his license.”
"Then,” cried the skipper, “he should be
able to send a message?”
He straightened with a jerk. The old
defiance was in his eye and lus jaws snapped
together.
"Bos’n !” he ordered sharply, “carry that
seaman for’d to flic wireless room. We’ll
save the ship yet!”
The hos'n went aft with the men. He
returned alone.
“Here,” cried the Old Man impatiently.
“Didn't I tell you to”
“Sorry,” said the bos’u, “but we can't.”
“Can’t!” roared the Old Man. “Can't.
And the ship sinking! Why can’t you?”
“Because,” said the bps’n, “the lad’s dead,”

Youth.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
How shall I spend my youth?
In mirth and careless dances?
With the red wine of love
And sidelong glances?
With the sheer joy of life.
Like a bird upward flying?
The dead are so soon asleep,
So long a-lying.
Clover and amber moon.
Tang of the sea, wild honey,
Love’s, brief divinity,
Kisses and money—
Let me crowd all of this
Into one day’s swift flying...
The dead are so soon asleep.
So long a-lying.

1926 SEASON.
The “ATCO” will make a very strong appeal to those faced with the "eees-
sity of keeping in order large areas of turf, i.e., secretaries of cricket, golf, lawn
tennis, and bowling clubs, proprietors of estates of an jcre or more, members of
park committees, hotelkeepers, &c. .
It is fitted with a 21-h.p. engine, which develops more than sufficient power
both to propel the machine and operate the cutter, thus requiring only one at-
tendant for guiding purposes. . s * e „„„
The running cost of an “Atco,” thanks to the scientific P** 6ol ® l ®” JjLif;*
struction, is remarkably low. An operator can very easily and eomplstßly cqt
1000 square yards of turf on a fuel consumption of a quarter-pint of petrol and
A twin silencer and an extra exhaust pipe (turned sideways to avoid annoy-
ance to operator) ensure extra quiet running of engine.
