READ THIS,
Western Australia is a much richer colony than is
generally supposed as regards minerals, agriculture and
pastoralism.— Sir Samuel Griffith,
Professor Brown, of Victoria, who made a thorough
examination of the south-western portion of Western
Australia, states that not the other colonies only, but
r yen the people of Western Australia evidently do not
know how much there is waiting For development. He
saw thousands of acres in contiguous blocks of fine choco-
late lands, light clay loams, and peaty soils. He thinks
t he important features of the district are its grand climate
and regular rainfall.

Melbourne have made lightning-like progress, so will

SPECIAL MEDICAL NOTICE.
Dr. G, H. RAYMOND,
Tub Eminent
Botanic Physician, Specialist & Medical Writer,
ijaa commenced Practice in Sydney, after a residence of
four years in Queensland, twelve months in Western Aus-
tralia, nearly three years in Soutli Australia, and eighteen
months in the City of Melbourne.
The latter place Mr. Ray mond was compelled to abandon
in consequence of; the climate proving detrimental to his
health.
During DR. RAYMOND’S practical experience of nine
years in Australia he has built up a reputation un-
approached by any other physician in chronic diseases in
the colonies. ' Dr. Raymond has also relieved and cured
patients who had tried to no avail the so-called leading
medical talent in the world. Proof of this will be seen in
His valuable and scientific publications; and Dr. Raymond
would call the attention of deaf people to his latest scien-
tific paper on the “ Merits and Demerits of Artificial Ear-
Drums and Electro-Magnetic Treatment.”
DR. RAYMOND would also inform deaf persons that he
is the only AURIST in the British Empire that ever
exposed the fallacy of sticking ear-drums in the car for
cure of deafness; and, moreover, it is rank quackery for
any “Aurist”or “Oculist” to induce people to believe
that a mere external remedy will cure a disease, the root
of which lies in the general constitution.
DR. RAYMOND is a Thorough Physician, as well as a
Specialist ; hence his unrivalled success.
A series of Aural and Ophthalmic Papers, supplementary
to a volume published inTBB7, will be sent on receipt of a
penny stamp. Address
No. 62 Carrington Street, Wynyard Square,
SYDNEY, N.S.W.
Works acknowledged by H.R.H. the Princess of Wales.
NOTE.—No mineral Poisons or the Knife used, nor
agonising blisters. Veritas odium parit!
Dr. Raymond intends shortly to Lecture on the eminent
American Medical Philosopher—Dr. Samuel Thomson,
founder of the Botanic System of Practice, and the first
man to expose the Errors and Fallacies of the Faculty.
Dr. Raymond will, when he mounts the public platform,
he the" youngest medical lecturer and advocate in the
English-speaking world, he not having yet attained his
thirtieth year.

Of Men and Women in the leading Medical Schools and

Edinburgh Royal Infirmary, Maternity and Lock Hospitals.
No medical man advertising in these colonies has medical
degrees which can be compared with his. Such eminent
qualifications, together with his recognised straightfor-
ward treatment, has naturally gained for him the reputa-
tion of being the
ONLY LEGALLY QUALIFIED DOCTOR
advertising in these colonics who combines with special
Knowledge Honest Treatment, as may easily be ascer-
tained by applying to any leading paper in the colony.
No diseases cause so much misery and distress as those
included in my speciality.

Suffering from the results of early follies or ex-
cesses, indigestion, foul mouth, costivencss, palpi-
tation, singing and pains in the ears and head,
specks before the eyes, giddiness, weakened

diseases of the bladder, kidneys, or liver, rheuma-
tism, impure blood, weakening discharges, impaired
vigor, sterility, premature decay, stricture, nervous-
ness, groundless fears, bashfulness, lassitude, and
'NERVOUS DEBILITY, should lose no time in
consulting him, since he has, by long experience
and thorough investigation of their nature* dis-

To If. F. Kloelmaxx, Esq.
Dear Sir, This is to certify that I, Patrick Keenan, was
taken ill about three years ago with a severe cold, which
tamed into Bronchitis and became chronic. I consulted
more than one doctor, and during that time took n great
qnanlilg of medicine without it doing me the slightest
goo I, but 1 became worse every day, wasting a wag until
I became a perfect skeleton. About February last I began
to spit up blood, and what with the cough and severe
pains iu my left lung, and the quantity of bad matter I
was expectorating every day, I became very much alarmed.
Hearing of your professional skill 1 consulted you, and
you told me you could cure me for a given sum. I agreed
and went under your treatment in March last. At the
end of, three months I was taken had one morning, and
vomited about two pints of blood, matter and stringy
phlegm. From that time T commenced to improve, and
was gaining in weight every day. About a month ago the
blood ceased coming, the cough disappeared, and the
lung healed completely, and thank, God and your pro-
fessional skill, I am as well as ever.
P. KEENAN.

This eminent Specialist, Bounder, and Chief

known Dispensary that now bears his name, re-
ceived his medical education in the leading colleges
and hospitals of Europe. He has devoted a life-
time to the study of
PRIVATE, NERVOUS, AND SKIN
DISEASES.
He has by profound research thoroughly investi-
gated their origin, traced their deadly sources and
insidious dissemination, and ascertained the surest
and safest methods by which they may be eradi-
cated, With these widely recognised qualifications
combined with unswerving faithfulness to hit
patients, he has during his practice, extending
over FORTY YEARS, attained a well-deserved
pre-eminence in their treatment. His practice
embraces diseases which probably cause more un-
happiness than any other class of troubles that
afflict mankind.

Land Nationalisation.
I The Single-tax Leaguers of New South
Wales have duly realised that which it was
certain they would, sooner or later, discover,
namely, that the Freetrade Government, led
hy Sir Henry Parkes, has been simply
playing with them. The relations between
the political faction headed by Parkes and
the Georgeites has always been one of veiled
discordance. The Single-taxers thought
they were making a cats-paw of the Govern-
ment, while the Government knew that it
vas making a cats-paw of the Single-taxers.
l’o a Parliamentary hand so experienced and
so astute as Sir Henry Parke.s, it must all
dong have been quite apparent that although
he Georgeites are exceedingly active and
“xtraordinarily noisy, they do notconstitutea
«»dy really possessing any considerable
tower in the constituencies. They are cx-
cllent at newspaper controversy, desperately
n earnest, zealous to the point of self-
acrihce. Parkes probably regarded them
s a great continental commander did
British soldiers. They were first-rate, but—
acidly there were not many of them. To a
olitician like Parkes, with whom principles
re but playthings, and all associations of
ealots merely pawns, the Single-taxers were
ertain to be rated pretty nearly in the pro-
option of importance which their actual
uting power bears to the electors as a whole,
hus regarded, they would be to him not so
inch Tennyson’s cousin Amy who was sup-
osed to be to her wealthy bridegroom-
respective in “ Locksley Hall”: Some-
dug better than his dog, a little dearer
lan his horse.” The Single-taxers would
3 to a man like Parkes something less than
s Yellow Pup, a little cheaper than his
alking horse, the Local Optionists.
o # #
The disillusionment which the Single-
xers have experienced was certain to
“fal them sooner or later. It is a distinct
in to the cause of Land-Nationalisation
at it has happened thus early. Had
fitters continued in their expected course
was probable that this wing of the
herents of the cause would have drifted
to almost inextricable entanglement with
at essentially conservative body, the Free-
iders of New South Wales. Seduced, as
consequence of the inexperience in prac-
al politics of their enthusiastic leaders,
;o believing the jarofessions of mere
miners, the Single-taxers imagined
mally that the class of people of whom
■rdekin, Bruce Smith, M'Millan and
orge Reid are the natural representa-
es, and of whom the whole tribes of
porters, station-agents, property-holders,
idlords and bankers, and the dependents
these, constitute the forces, could be
oled into even approximating to a system
ich would destroy their most cherished
ights and wipe them out of existence to
all intents and purposes. And in their raw
enthusiasm they entered upon a crusade so
extraordinary by a preliminary step of cor-
responding fatuousness. Their first proceed-
ing in view of this momentous enterprise
was to divide the forces of Land-Nationalisa-
tion, by repulsing and repudiating all those
who adhered to the methods of Protection.
When Land-Nationalisation first took root
in New South Wales, it was among the
radicals, as was natural. And the radicals
were Protectionists to a man. It was not
until the principles of the cult were pretty
widely adopted that it seemed good to a few
active propagandists to diverge, and by
seeking an alliance with the Conservatives
in the colony, who styled themselves
h reetradors merely because they had become
wealthy under the existing mongrel fiscal
conditions, they objected to any alteration
which might disturb the advantages they
I now how to turn to account. Protection
was repugnant to them, not because they
were students of economics and comprehended
the principles involved, but merely because
it was a change, where they objected to any
change. The simple-minded enthusiasts who
led the Single-taxers actually conceived that
these people were real enthusiasts for a
principle. Honest and earnest themselves,
they were not prone to suspect that others
were merely making-believe and mouthing
tine economic phrasing while having at heart
nothing save a preservation of their own
existing advantages.
* * #
The recent fiat of the so-called Freetrade
Ministry in once more refusing to deal with
the existing bastard and anomalous tariff,
succeeding so many previous demonstrations
of disinclination to meddle with the economic
status quo, has at last proved too severe a
strain for even the sanguine and credulous
faith of the Single-taxers. Their eyes are
opened, at length, to the disheartening fact
that it is they that have been the cat’s-paw
all along, not the Freetrade Conservatives.
Now that the glamour of plausible profes-
sions and prospective promises has lost its
influence, it is unlikely that the Single-
taxers will again fall under the subtle spell.
They will see things and persons as they
actually exist, not as their distempered fancy
had painted them. They will recognise the
ridiculous incompatibility of legislation to
appropriate ground-rents by taxation and
alliance with Burdekin arid Co. They will
be able to appreciate the significant fact
that of the sixty odd members of the Legis-
lative Assembly who constitute the Free-
trade representatives, there are actually
only three—and those three men of no
standing or influence in the party —who are
not utterly antagonistic to that interference
with the sacred rights of property, that
forms the very essence of the Single-Tax
doctrine. They will perceive, further, that
among the protectionists on the Opposition
benches there are more friends to Land-Na-
tionalization than sit on the Ministerial side,
and that, in effect, all the progressive and
Liberal tendencies of the age are repre-
sented on the latter side, whereas the Go-
vernment benches have almost a monopoly
of the Conservative elements.
* * *
AN ith minds thus emancipated from a
transient access of delusion, it should be-
come possible for the Single-taxers to appre-
hend that even had the present Government
ostensibly given a partial effect to their
views, there would have been no real ap-
proximation to their ultimate ideal. The
most that could have been expected from so
subtle an opportunist and timeserver as Sir
Henry Parkes would have been a land-tax
limited by sweeping exceptions. All lands
under a defined value would have been
exempted for certain. Parkes never puts
his foot further than he believes the ground
to be solid. He would make provision for
having the support of the comparatively
small land-holders in taxing the great ones.
And he would assuredly not press his taxa-
tion so far as even to drive the latter
to desperation. But an exemption—any
exemption—would, of course, knock the
bottom out of any Single-tax character,
which otherwise even mild land-taxation
might be imagined to have. A land-tax
with exemptions would not bring the Single-
taxers’ millenium one fraction nearer to
accomplishment than it is to-day. The big
men would not be stung into wanting to cut
the tails off the small holders. Their exer-
tions would be concentrated upon getting
back their own tails. In other words, they
would work upon the apprehensions of small
land-holders, lest, in view of the alleged
influence and admitted objects of the Single-
taxers, they also should, after a while,”be
taxed. And they would work up, with all
the wealth and influence which have been
so strongly utilised against fiscal charges, an
agitation to take taxation off land and place
it upon anything else in this wide world.
By such means the hands of the purely fiscal
and professionally-political section of the
Protection party would be strengthened. It
would be but a question of time when the
propertied class and its hangers-on would
split from the importers and their depen-
dants, and would throw its weight and in-
fluence on the side of - the Protectionists.
But the propertied class would, in such case,
strike a bargain. In order to attract it, the
political Protectionists—those whom Parkes
kicked into Protection because they were
anti-Parkesites, and when secured the support
of the metropolitan morning journals by
declaring for Freetrade would make a
business of denouncing taxation of land
as unnecessary and undesirable. In such
case, Land-Nationalisationists would have
been left utterly out in the cold.
Humbugged and betrayed by the Free-
traders and repulsed and contemned by the
Protectionists, these principles would suffer
another period of submergence, such as they
have experienced for over half a century.
Principles may possess an irradiable essence
of vitality. But that will no more prevent
their lying inoperative for a season than the
fertility of a grain of wheat will enable it to
bud and produce leaf and flower, if by any
means it be enclosed in the sarcophagus of a
Pll akaoll. The principles of Land-National-
isation had an earnest and devoted exponent
in Hpknorr. Vet, despite his unllinchingand
most industrious propagandist!!, they fell
into abeyance from the day of his ‘death
until Henry George revived and replanted
them.
* * *
The fact appears to be that in New South
Walse the cause of Land-Nationalisation has
fallen into the hands of men of immature
judgment and over-sanguine temperament.
These imagine that the refrain they devote
themselves to bring about can be accom-
plished with a hop, skip and jump. More-
over, their reverence for the latest and most
eloquent exponent of the principles of the
comrnunisation of land has overborne or
extinguished their own faculty of original
thought, and even of adaptation. Because
Henry Georoe is a Freetrader as well as a
Land-Nationaliser and has concerted a plan
of making each of his favourite theories
dependent on the other, or, at least, to
fit in with the other, they have
abandoned their own judgment, and have
submitted to follow their leader in all
his windings and vagaries. They have thus
failed to perceive—just as they failed to see
that the Freetraders were trifling with them
—that Mr. George has really subordinated
Land-Nationalisation to Freetrade by his
preference for Single-Taxism over actual
abolition of private property in land. By
this divergence from the straight path of his
own argument, up to that point he has
interposed enormous and quite unnecessary
difficulties in the way of the general adoption
of the greater reform. So long as Land-
Nationalisation be advocated in its simple,
unadulterated essence, ihe people of any
country in the world could set to work to
adopt it straightaway. But the Single-Tax
application of the remedy stands in quite a
different position. Before that can be
adopted by any civilized com mb pity on the
face of the earth, save Great Britain, Turkey
(if that can be termed a civilized country)
and New South Wales, every one must first
undergo the particularly difficult process of
reversing its fiscal system, without any real
necessity, so far as the adoption of Land-
Nationalisation is concerned.
* * *
Then again, reverting to New South
Wales, the Single-Tax contingent lose sight
of the most essential of all considerations.
They don t take into account human nature.
They reckon they can talk small freeholders
and selectors into giving up their present
advantage, in expectation of an advantage
more than equal, but quite in the theoretical
stage. Every selector in the colony, and
nearly every freeholder, looks to the un-
earned increment on his land to make him
rich. On this, far more than to any present
use, than to any result of industry applied
to the soil, the selector relies to give him
ease in middle-age and wealth in more ad-
vanced life. The Single-Taxers expect to
eradicate this general and all but universal
turn of expectation, and to convince (he
bucolic mind that things will be much better
if all unearned increment be surrendered in
consideration of wages becoming high, and
clothes, notions, and groceries cheap.
* # #
This is a sort of expectation so delightfully
infantile and verdant that it is almost painful
to disturb it. But to entertain it can lead to
nothing but disappointment. It may be
stated as a certain rule that no ordinary
man surrenders a certain present advantage
in actual possession for another sort of
advantage not quite certain, no matter
how lovely it may be made to look.
Land-owners know quite as well as Single-
Taxers can tell the landless, that so long as
they possess the land, they hold the pull over
all the rest of tllfi community. Are not the
Single-Taxers preaching this fact every day ?
The men who hold the land are masters of
everything else and of every other class. If
they never knew it before, they have learned
it from the Single-Taxers’ discussions and
broad-cast pamphlets. Yet the Single-
Taxers' theory supposes that they will
amicably surrender all these advantages,
and consent not to be the fortunate
ones of the world’s population. There
is a high and etherial conception of
human nature in the nineteenth century, ex-
pressed in this amiable expectation. But,
looking at it with the cool eye of practical
probability, it has no aspect of workableness
about it. The Land-Nationalisationist, pure
and simple, takes a different view. He
reckons that the land-owner won’t abate one
jot of his pretensions without being com-
pelled to. And compulsion, by constitutional
means, requires that the landless shall out-
number, out-influence, out-manoeuvre, and
out-vote the land-owning.
* * #
fo attain this there may be more ways
than one. But the most obvious way is un-
doubtedly to transfer to our own colony the
industrial activity which creates great popu-
lations in concentration. That is to sav
manufacturing industries must be encouraged
and fostered. The urban artizan and
mechanic is the proletaire who reads
and thinks, and discusses, and debates, ami
reflects on his condition, and on social pro
blems generally. It is lie who in all coun-
tries, and during all ages has been the source
and spring of revolutions. It is from him
and by him only that this great reform can
and will be accomplished. So lorm as
New South Wales remains a mere farm
turning out raw materials by the labour of a
scattered and dissevered population of buco-
lic toilers, all hope of any greai reform, such
as the abolition of land-monopoly, is hope-
less, and those- who strive for it are mere
beaters of the air.
An Ideal City.
'' >tEN the human race begins, from any reason
to congregate together in a new land, - its first
act is to construct an offensive plague-spot and
call it a city, it acquired tin's habit very early
in the world’s history, and it will probably con-
tinue to follow the practice through all time
Somewhere, away back in the hazy beginning
of humanity, two patriarchs pitched their ten is
side by side in the wilderness, and threw t w
bones and garbage out in front of their door
because the ash-barrel was not invented in those
days, and the dustman had not yet been di
covered ; and thus were laid the foundations
the first city known to history. Then the
reared families, who married and intermarriee
and gradually consolidated into a fixed coi
munity ; and by-and-bye the gathering d
veloped into a motley confluence of sores am
sin and mud-built hovels, and the grass Mas a
trodden away into slush round the rising tow ,
and the bills of mortality began to swe, ,
because the adjacent stream was polluted wi [
seM'age, and all sorts and conditions of unclea
ness. Gradually, too, the dwellers in th
original city became a stunted and knock-knecr
race, built on a spidery plan and specificatio
that was entirely their own. There was i
particular order of architecture about the r
homes, and in this respect their descendants o ’
the nineteenth century have carefully follower
their example ; there was no pleasure and litt e
romance in their lives—theirs was merely tl
story of men who lived, and grew old, am
died, and were not missed when they were
gone, and the citizens of to-day, as a ml
leave much the same record behind them. Am ’
so far as the masses are concerned, the modem
city is just the same as its original progenito
Damascus, the eternal and unchangeable capita
of the Syrian oasis, stands as it did in the day
of Abraham, and yet the dismal, ungainly
hovels that fringe the new suburbs of Waterlo
and Botany, or lie scattered about the Wes
Melbourne swamp, would not be much out
place in the street which is called Straight. Th
leprosy-stricken shanty of Galilee, and th
Chinaman’s den in Sydney, are equally desir-
able residences, for civilisation has little appre
ciation of beauty, and its knowledge of cleanl
ness is chiefly superficial. And, therefore, th
ideal city is still a dream, and the grea
communities of this and every other land ar
mere agglomerations of dispiriting ugliness, am
disease, and red brick, and angular lamp-posts
and broken pavements, and every othe
unsightly object which man has ever learned t
construct for his own insane gratification, am
for the demoralisation of posterity.
* * #
The modern city, at its best, consists of on
or two elegant thoroughfares surrounded bj
ugliness and desolation. As a rule, even the
show r thoroughfare—the one which is writtej
up in guide books, and exhibited to gaping
visitors, and drivelled about at banquets when
the prosperity of the nation is on the pro
gramme—tails off into Chinamen and slop
buckets at either end, but the central portioi
of if exhibits the results of many centuries o ’
progress, and the community is proud of i ,
accordingly. It serves as a disguise to ai
incurable eruption of back-lanes and rights
of-way, among which lie a shapeless mass
of sheds and shanties, but these things
are varnished over by the stately tene-
ments in front, which serve the same pur-
pose as a coating of whitewash on a corpse.
But beyond and around and on every side of
this region there is a land of scraggy ungain -
lincss where the city begins to run to seed. The
streets are hare, narrow and dusty, angular,
triangular, crooked, spiral, and cut into all
sorts of mathematical figures, and disfigured by
the flaring posters and placards of that evil
genius, tiie unhanged advertising fiend. Then
the gaunt, unlovely terrace comes into evidence
with its banged and battered door opening
abruptly into the street, and its naked gable
glaring at the sky ; and betw'een the terraces
there linger sundry remnants of the past in the
shape of st raggling, mouldered hovels, one storey
high, roofed with old, green, time-rotted
shingles, and situate either a yard above or a
yard below the present street level ; and be-
tween the hovels is that inevitable piece of
waste ground on which rubbish is shot and left
to fester, because some speculative public enemy
is holding the property for a rise. And some-
where in the same vicinity will lie found the
square, black, galvanised-iron church, looking
like a hat-box gone mad, in which the members
of a vociferous creed thud and howl and sing
tuneless hymns for the glory of the Lord, and
thus add their humble quota to the grimness of
a joyless civilisation.
# # »
It is no one’s business to disguise the ugli-
ness of a modern city. The great, inflamed
gasometer is therefore planted in a conspicuous
situation that all the world may recognise its
presence, and though the gasometer and the
palace are capable of equally picturesque effect,
nobody is fined or imprisoned for having cursed
his fellow-men witli so much gratuitous un-
sightliness. The huge towering factory comes
into the same category, but when civilisation
is somewhat further advanced there is hope
that the owner will be compelled to carry on
his avocation without making himself a public
eyesore, or if he insists on being an eyesore that


Jtis gaunt, hungry-looking building will be cou-
liscated and reconstructed at the owner’s ex
pense. The red-painted girder bridge, whose
tints glare out like an angry sunset as it
straddles across some dirty creek, will also be
toned down at the risk and cost of the indivi-
dual who is responsible for its unnecessary
hideousness; and the shot-tower, and the
fourteen-storey coffee-palace will both be pulled
down and carted away, and something will be
done to the individual who chalks advertise-
ments on the pavements, and the lady whose
washing is hung out where it will be an offence
to the public eye will be regarded as an enemy
to the commonwealth and treated as such.
Also, the man who builds a boiler-foundry will
be required, for the good of his fellow men, to
devote the same attention to architectural
beauty as the person who builds a hotel or a
bank in a great city thoroughfare, and the
mansion which is now built of freestone in
front, and of garbage keg and broken down
vate behind, shall be constructed alike at either
end, by virtue of an Act of Parliament pro-
hibiting any human being from wrecking, either
in whole or in part, the landscape which is the
common property of all.
* * *
The sodden, bloated, pimply tenement house,
too, has a conspicuous place among the mon-
strosities of the modern city, and if civilisation
is ever to he worth anything it must either be
abolished or wholly reconstructed. It is caked
in grime from the foundation to the roof, and
its crumbling stairways, and hingeless doors,
and uprooted door-bells, its leprous banisters
and battered scraper, and rusted railings and
unclean doorsteps, its foulness and malaria and
internal darkness are diseases that can only be
cured by fire or dynamite. The long rows of
mangy, tenth-rate shops, where the unwhole-
some apple is displayed in company with a stock
of sticky confectionery, and the caved-in tart
and the flatulent ginger-beer are exhibited
side by side with the old brown-paper cigar, all
call aloud for the same drastic remedy. And if
the white man is in any way superior to the
Hottentot or black aboriginal, and desires to
retain that superiority, then the gruesome
Bethsaida Chapel must also be sacrificed, along
with the dingy pawnshop next door, and the
malodorous public-house at the corner ; and
the marine-store fiend, and the man who
pounds on galvanised-iron tanks for his liveli-
hood, and the ghoul with the apple-stall, and
the individual who trades in gravestones,
and a hundred others, must find some
means to disguise their unsightly occupations,
at their landlord’s expense, and cease to offend
the eye of the nation at large. And civilisa-
tion calls aloud for some adequate vengeance
against the artist in old boards who constructs
the cheap suburban cottage—that square con-
trivance on four legs, with three wooden steps
leading up to the door, and a pool of stagnant
water underneath, which is dashed down by the
bare roadside, unshaded, unfenced, and
decorated only by a pile of coal and wood
beside the back-entrance, a shrill female hang-
ing out washing, and the footprints of a goat
beneath the window. The cities of the Nine-
teenth Century, from Berlin to Melbourne and
from Brisbane to far-off Mexico or Bagdad have
one great feature in common—they all want to
be re-built by a race of comparatively sane
architects on an entirely new model.
* * *
When the boastful Anglo-Saxon has fully
realised that even Ids race, the greatest and
most enlightened on tire earth, has lived since
the beginning of its history after the manner
of the mole and the hog, and has grown so
accustomed to its squalid surroundings as to be
unconscious of their all-pervading foulness,
then he will probably rise up and construct his
cities afresh. And when tire re-construction is
completed the ideal city of the future will be
the beginning of a new era for humanity. Its
■streets will be at least 150 feet in width, and
shaded everywhere by rows of trees, while each
gutter will be a flowing stream of crystal water
instead of a stagnant drain exhaling pestilence
and miasma. A strict building law will enforce
grace and uniformity of architecture, and will
abolish simultaneously the gigantic coffee-palace
which scrapes the clouds, and the grotesque
shanty built of old scrap-iron and disused kero-
sene-tins, which disfigures the modern thorough-
fare ; and the individual who erects an ungainly
hoarding and pastes thereon a flaring adver-
tisement in divers colours will be declared a
felon and treated as such. Then the hideous
slums which breed vice and moral disease will
cease to exist, for a slum of wide boulevards
and clear water and spreading foliage would bo
at once an anomaly and an impossibility ; and
even the larrikin and the Chinaman will lie
compelled to live in the light of day, because
the courts and alleys in which they love to con-
gregate will be swept away for ever, and the
speculator who attempts to rebuild these dens
will be classed with the burglar and the
assassin, and be dealt with in the same way
as the other avowed enemies of society. And,
above all things, beauty will be held to be as
essential as existence itself, and the proprietor
nf the factory or the gasometer or the old bone
depot, will be required to construct the abode of
bis noxious calling in such a manner that it may
be placed alongside tire viceroy's palace or the
president’s mansion without outraging the eye ;
and cleanliness will be enforced by law, whereby
the proprietor of the rack-rented tenement
bouse will find it necessary to keep his proper ty
as fresh and spotless as the morning air, with
the- alternative of serving a term of imprison-
ment while his buildings are purified and reno-
vated at Iris expense.
*. # #
And even here the reform wrll not be ended.
For the earth is wide and space is plentiful,
and when men understand this fact the cramped
and frowsy terrace, with its doors and windows
opening on the pavement, will be abolished, and
the citizen wlro builds a house without a few
yards of lawn or garden between it and tire
busy street will be extinguished by Act of Par-
liament, and, if be persists in Iris project, will
be sent to the same asylum as the other citizen
who endeavoured to build a house without walls
or roof. And even the inborn right of the free
Anglo-S axon to keep a festering eyesore in his
own yard for his own private use and
benefit will be rudely interfered with,
and the battered fence and the gate which
hangs on one damaged hinge will be a
crime, and the foul brick smoke-stack of
the factory will be a misdemeanour, and the loud
street preacher, and the wandering banana em
porium, and the slimy, mouldering wharf, and
the crumbling hulk left abandoned and rotting
in the mud, and everything else of an unsightly
character which the arm of the law can reach
will be wiped out, and the individual who is
responsible for their existence will be called
'upon to answer for his offence in thus disfigur-
ing the earth, whose beauty is the common pro-
perty of humanity. And in these days even
the Yarra will become a crystal stream, and
the scum-laden waters of Sydney’s inner bays
will be restored to their original purity, for
when mankind begins to realise the value of
grace and cleanliness, it will resolve that for
every act which befouls the earth and the
waters someone must be held responsible.
* * *
As for the cost of this great transformation
it can only be defrayed in one way—by the
confiscation to the Slate of the land on which
the old city is built the laud which the
capitalist and the landlord have so miserably
misused. Sooner or later the necessities of
civilisation will render this course unavoidable.
The value of land depends entirely on the
presence of a landless population ; without
them the sites of Sydney and Melbourne would
l>e of no more account than the empty wastes
beside the Gulf of Carpentaria or the Great
Australian Bight; and when the masses com-
prehend that they alone have made the fortunes
of the land-grabber and the monopolist, they
will comprehend also their right to share in the
millions which they have created. And even
if the title of the hereditary land-stealer had
been originally based on divine right and the
express decree of Providence, instead of upon
greed and fraud and villainy, he has long since
been weighed and found wanting, and any
claim he ever possessed is justly forfeited. It
is he and he alone who is responsible
for the slums and the fever-dens, the
noisome by-ways and filthy alleys and moulder-
ing tenements, which make the fairest city of
the earth a plague-spot and a scene of human
degradation ; he has built these places for his
own profit and for the moral and physical ruin
of humanity, and so long as he remains they
will endure and flourish. He has grown rich
on cholera and leprosy, and has turned typhoid
into gold, and has paid dividends out of infec-
tion and ugliness, and, therefore, it is but a
limited measure of justice that the monstrosities
which he has created should be removed at his
expense. But, unhappily, the masses are slow
to realise the necessity for reform, and are
pitiably ignorant as well; and the alleged edu-
cated citizen is proud of the jagged highways,
and the dust, and the ash-box in the gutter, and
the dull, dead monotony of the miles of weary
streets, all equally guiltless of grace and beauty ;
and he gushes about these things in guide-books
and drinks about them at banquets, when he
ought rather to pray for the coming of a con-
flagration which will wipe them all out and
start things afresh.
One Person One Vote.
The Electoral Bill at present in the hands of
the New South Wales Government makes, it is
understood, certain provisions for the enfran-
chisement of women. The full character of the
provisions has not yet been given to the public,
but no secret is made of the fact that the Bill
will try to place women on an equal footing
with men so far as the right of voting at Parlia-
mentary elections is concerned. It will extend
the principle of One Man One Vote into One
Person One Vote, thus answering the demands
of abstract justice and redeeming sex from
being a political disability. But a Bill is one
thing and an Act another, and one of the most
effective means of retarding a reform for which
the majority is ready is the inclusion of it in a
Bill containing items acceptable to a minority
only. Democratic sentiment demands that each
citizen shall possess one vote and no one more
than one, but this sentiment is less strong in
some regions than in others, and to withhold its
application to politics where it is strong until it
can be applied where it is weak is tactically bad
and worse as statesmanship. It is, in fact, the
method of a blunderer or an enemy. Sir Henry
Parkes in effect tells a community ready to
accept one man one vote that he will not let
them have it now and will only give it to them
when, at some distant date, he ascertains that
they will take one woman one vote also.
# * *
If the concession of one man one vote meant
the retardation of one woman one vote, we
would go with Sir Henry ; but not one word
of argument can be adduced in support of such
a hypothesis. On the other hand, from the
day the community shows itself ready to accept
one man one vote its Parliament, elected on a
different principle, ceases to be democratically
representative. True political growth consists
in the adoption of governing principles when
they ripen. If the adoption be deferred, injury
is inflicted on the community, not only in
respect of the loss of political power residing
in the principle, but also in respect of its arrest
of development. Sir Henry’s Bill, if defeated,
will not alone gain nothing for women but it will
prevent men from coming into possession of a
fundamental right. And if the Bill be up to
the promises of its designer there is every pro-
bability that defeat will be encountered. Those
opposed to one man one vote will be against it ;
those opposed to women voters will be against
it; but many who are in favour of one man one
vote will also be against it. These last will see
in enfranchised women clerical tools. Visions
of ballot-boxes stuffed with votes recorded
under dictation will rise before their eyes and
they will divide against the Bill. Visions of
enfranchised women, whipped up to the bust
ings by teetotal and religious fanatics, will also
have an effect. Neophytes are prone to be
over-zealous, and woman, come into this new
power, will be tempted to strive to settle every
question of personal right and freedom by a
vote at the ballot-box. It must be admitted
that such excesses are probable. For ourselves,
we are prepared to meet the probabilities, hav-
ing confidence that sex is no bar to the acquisi-
tion of knowledge, and that whatever advantage
may he taken of her ignorance at the start,
woman will, before irretrievable harm is done,
set her face to the light. But this teaching
requires time to have itself approved, and Pie-
nlier Pabk.es’ Bill comes before a majority is
ready. That is the pinch of the situation. The
male democracy will continue to be practically
disfranchised by the vote of property, not
because the community rejects one man one
vote, but because it, for the present, rejects one
woman one vote. That is why we regard the
proposed Bill as the work of a blunderer or an
enemy of one man one vote. But all through
we have treated the Bill as a genuine measure,
intended to secure" one person one vote in the
full meaning of the words. It may turn out
that we have taken too much for granted, and
that only such a female franchise as the present
male one will be offered. If so, the Bill should
be promptly wrecked, as its effect would be to
double existing inequalities.
* * *
If the drawing-room is to have the franchise,
so must the scullery ; if the rustle of silk is to
be heard at the ballot box, so plain cotton must
be seen there; if the owner of property be ein
powered to run his pencil through the name of
a Parliamentary aspirant a similar power must
be conferred on the woman who has no more
than she stands up in. Men, themselves on the
point of emerging from a system of manhood
suffrage where the man, owing to residential
restrictions, possesses less voting power than an
unimproved allotment of stony earth, must see
to it that women are not pushed into their
empty places. Under every, view, then, the
proposed Bill excites distrust. It stands be-
tween men and true manhood suffrage, and
owing to the exigencies of Parliamentary life it
may be kept where it is for an indefinite period,
The natural course is here the true one. Let
the present New South Wales Parliament give
one man one vote and let that Parliament, re-
presenting the male democracy, give one person
one vote.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Old Order Changeth.
On the recommendation of Mr. Attorney-General
Simpson the New South Wales Government last
week decided that every person accused of
capital crime and unable to fee counsel on his
own behalf, shall in future be permitted to
select his attorney and counsel at the expense
of the State. Hitherto such accused persons
were left without legal assistance until (some-
times within half-an-hour of their trial) the
presiding judge nominated a barrister to defend
them. As a general rule, the practitioner thus
nominated belonged to the extremely-junior bar
and stood towar ds the prisoner in the position
occupied by a just-diplomaed medical student
towards a patient upon whom he had
been suddenly called to perform by him-
self the most difficult and dangerous operation
in surgery. For years The Bulletin has
stood alone in drawing public attention
to the monstrous judicial injustice involved
in the system which has just been obli-
terated in New South Wales by Attorney-
General Simpson, and, as opportunity permitted,
the right of a moneyless accused to legal aid
matching in ability that employed for the
prosecution was consistently advocated in these
columns. There was more in the subject than
mere justice to an accused person ; the relation
of the State to crime and innocence was in-
volved. We held, and hold, that the State
should be as solicitous to prove the innocence as
the guilt of a person charged, whereas by the
animating sentiment hitherto the resources, of
the State have been entirely directed to the
conviction of prisoners. This was simply the
adoption by the State of the common police-
man’s frailty. That officer is disposed to regard
an acquittal as a calamity, and a conviction as
an event on which to be complimented. The
policeman may yet be educated to the point of
seeing that as strenuous efforts should be made
to secure the acquittal of an innocent as the
conviction of a guilty man. Anyhow, the New
South Wales Government has led the way in
this direction, and The Bulletin rejoices that
at least one iniquity is about to be wiped out of
the administration of the Criminal Law of New
South Wales.
A National Programme.
The coming general election in New Zealand
will be the first in Australasian history in which
the power has been actually wielded by the
people—the much vaunted but hitherto non-
existent principle of absolute and unqualified
manhood suffrage is about to assert itself.
Twelve months ago Sir George Grey —almost
the only colonial democrat now living who has
worked for instead of merely screaming for the
Democracy—carried by sheer force of will a
measure in which plural voting was abolished,
and the overwhelming power of bricks and
earth to override the voice of the nation became
a thing of the past. Under the new system
every adult male citizen acquires a vote after six
months’ residence—the workman whose qualifi-
cation is the tenancy of a four-roomed cottage,
or a bark hut, or a tent upon a goldfield in the
lone interior, can gain no less, and the plutocrat
with property scattered over fifty electorates
can gain no more. In the face of these new
conditions more than one politician who has
lived for years on the multiplied suffrage of the
publican and the landlord and the money-
lender has already retired from the contest, and
they have all relieved their feelings as they fled
by stating that the moral decay of Parliament
has compelled them to withdraw, and seek the
association of brighter minds and abler in-
tellects. The Labour party, meanwhile, has
wisely resolved that it will fight for its
own cause alone, and will let religion
Dnd teetotalism and Imperial politics and
all other extraneous questions slide. Its
programme consists of the establishment of a
land and income tax as the principal source of
revenue, the extension of the Eight Hours’
system to all branches of industry, and the
total abolition of the infamous sweating system
-—that dubious blessing of British origin which
is fast taking root in all parts of Australasia.
The party has also pledged itself to absolutely
prohibit the further accumulation of large
estates, and will do its utmost to .recover, those
already alienated ; and should it secure a ma-
jority in the House of Representatives one of
its first proceedings will be to re-introduce the
Employers’ Liability Bill, the Bill for the aboli-
tion of the truck system, and other democratic
measures which were contemptuously rejected
by the Council last session, with the under-
standing that this time the question will be
resolved into a trial of strength between the
nominee Chamber and the nation in which the
“ Lords” must either submit, or forever be
abolished. If the National Party will but hold
together and refuse to be led away upon side
issues and sectarian differences, then Govern-
ment by the people will become a reality for the
first time in any part of the British Empire.
Hitherto the most that Democracy has ac-
complished is to give one vote to the work-
man and twenty-five to the landlord, and
the importer, and the illiterate pugilist who
has made a pile by pounding his fellow-man ;
and consequently the landlord and the importer
and the pugilist have run the affairs of the
country, and because they have failed the
world has resolved that popular government is
only a mitigated success at the best. Probably
the weakest point in the New' Zealand Labour
Party is its leader. Sir Robert Stout is a
lawyer who longs for popular freedom and six-
and-eightpence—a barrister who yearns for
democracy and “refreshers”—a liberal agnostic,
and a howling teetotaller, who is supposed to
be free from bigotry and guile. He is a man of
great ability, and has, so far, proved himself
too clever to succeed. Also, he has more
opinionsjthan any other man on earth, and
owns an eye which quells the judge and jury
when he rises in defence of the suspected hog-
thief. But whether he knows enough or
whether he doesn’t know too much to lead the
National Party with reasonable success time
alone can reveal.
Certain “ Portions of Liver.”
The accomplished cable-liar is never so happy
as when he can get hold of a great bloated
horror and send it out in all its howling naked-
ness to garnish the literature of Australia. He
is a literary ghoul scratching among the dust
of a charnel house—a vampire with a diseased
appetite for severed heads, and brains, and feet
that have been removed with a saw and then
hidden away in a cellar. A corpse in a cave
makes this animal feel better, especially if it is
an old corpse and much trodden down ; and he
loves to forward full and complete details about
a person who crunched his uncle’s aged bones
beneath a cart, and then perforated his whole
family with a pickaxe. But for some time past
the trade in exploded remnants of humanity has
been slack, so last week he sent along the
following statement with its accompanying con-
tradiction, in order to gladden his readers and
shed a gleam of sunshine over each cultivated
intellect :
A woman living in Whitechapel has informed the police
that a young man of superior class hired a bedroom on
the upper story of her house, and that on one occasion
she saw portions of liver, some plain brass rings, resem-
bling wedding rings, and numerous blood-stains about the
room. The man left his lodgings secretß' on the day of
the last murder, and the woman has not since heard or
seen anything of him.
LONDON, 12th October.
The woman who related a story to the police regarding
the conduct of a man supposed to be Jack the Ripper has
modified some of the statements and disclaimed others.
It will be noted here that by some unhappy
mistake the anecdote and the contradiction
were allowed to appear, not only in the same
paper, but in the same paragraph, and thus the
liver is snatched away before the unwholesome
reader has time to appreciate it. This error
should be guarded against for the future. If
the second cable had only been held over till
the next day the public could have spent 24
hours in mentally accumulating a joyous
picture of horror. They could have filled in a
shadowy sketch of a dingy room at the top of a
dingy stair, and with a window consisting
partly of glass and chiefly of brown paper and
old felt hat. The ceiling would be cracked and
fallen in, and the paper in rags, while the door
and the doorposts would be black with age. A
rusted frying-pan would be standing on top of
a pile of ashes in the grate, and in lieu of a
table there would be an abandoned boot-trunk,
and in place of a bed a pile of rags and news-
papers in the corner, and where a chair ought
to have been there might be observed a board
torn out of the floor and propped up by bricks
at either end. And seated on this latter con-
trivance the eye of faith might have discerned
“ a young man of superior class” stained all
over with gore, and musing profoundly over
certain Portions of Liver. He was an indivi-
dual with black hair, and pallid features,
and a glassy light shining in his optic—
evidently a person who took a Dead Body three
times a day regularly, and was addicted to a
Mangled Corpse. Also he had the Stealthy
Style so freely expounded in penny novels, and
he was armed with a knife, a large gun, two
axes, and a saw, the last three weapons having
brains adhering to the edge. The picture is
completed by a dim silhouette of the landlady
fainting on the rotten stair, having been scared
out of her senses by seeing the aforesaid Liver
through the keyhole. But, alas, before the
reader has time even to imagine the thrilling
details the whole picture is busted into thin air.
There was no young man brooding in a murky
room at all; there were no axes and deadly
weapons, no blood and no mystery of any sort.
There wasn’t even any Liver. And when these
features are abolished there is no story left, and
what on earth the cable was sent for passes
human understanding.
Dear Bulletin, —Divorce by mutual consent
has not “ proved itself an uunfixed evil where-
ever it has been tried.” Take the case of
Prussia. The Prussian Landrecht (country’s
law) makes divorce by mutual consent very
easy, the proceedings being thus:—The dis-
satisfied couple appear before the judge of the
Divorce Court and swear that they possess
towards each other a “ mutual, unconquerable
aversion,” as the translation of the technical


term, “ uniiberwindliche abneigung,” would be.
The judge, after having enquired into details,
gives them six months (or three months, I am
not certain about this) time to re-consider their
decision. If there are any young children in
the case, the applicants for divorce have during
this time to satisfy the judge appointed for the
interests of under-aged children (the judiciary
“chief guardian,” as he is called) about the
arrangements for the children’s future ; and if
the judge in divorce considers the parson
of the parish a reasonable and discreet
man, he also usually informs him officially
about the intended divorce, so that the
latter may try to establish a reconciliation
if possible; but this is not obligatory on the
judge’s part. If, at the end of the six (or three)
months, the couple still declare that they have
a mutual unconquerable aversion, if they pro-
duce the certificate of the chief guardian that
he has no objection, and if the judge is satisfied
about the provisions made for the wife, the
marriage is at once declared null and void with-
out any more evidence. This law has been
given to Prussia by Frederick the Great,
and it has been in force ever since in all
those Prussian provinces which constituted
the Prussia of Frederick’s time. There is not
yet a common civil law in existence for the
German empire, although a Commission of the
greatest law-teachers of the different States
has been working out a common code for many
years past. And the old Prussian Divorce Law
—so far as I am aware—far from being con-
sidered an “ unmixed evil,” has given such
satisfaction that, amongst its principal statutes,
the “divorce by mutual consent” will, in all
probability, be the law for the whole of
Germany, as it has been for the greater part
of Prussia for more than 100 years past.—
Yours, A German Doctor.

A vigorous contemporary is apparently seeking
after information about the New South Wales
Assembly. This is what he wants to know :
Then what shall be said of a Parliament in which
bestial drunkenness is tolerated and winked at ? What is
to be thought of an Assembly in which members roll and
stagger about in a state of filthy intoxication, interrupt-
ing the proceedings with their drunken jabherings,
vomiting over the floor where they lie wallowing like
hogs until carried out unconscious by the attendants?
Things are bad enough thus in all conscience, but when
the red noses of dipsomaniacs propped up in drunken
sleep between other members, &c., &c.
Well, what is to be said on these subjects, any-
how ? From a personal standpoint we give the
question up, but, perhaps, the best plan would
be for our contemporary to say the whole
dictionary right off, and then he could at least
feel that he had hove the entire English language
into the chasm, and done everything that words
were capable of. There are upwards of 120,000
expressions in the language at present, including
blessings, curses, names of animals, obsolete
verbs, geometrical terms, and remarks used in
botany; let him dash them all down at once,
and state that is the way he feels on the matter.
And if he finds this mode of expressing himself
to be weak and inadequate, we can only suggest
that he should walk into the house, and
solemnly, but firmly, deposit on the table an
empty bottle, a dead cat, a skunk, an old dish-
cloth, a snake, an obscene novel, and a deceased
cuttle-fish, and explain that these objects are
intended to denote a contempt that is too large
for words, and a loathing that exceeds the
limits of time and space, that bursts all earthly
dimensions, and makes grammar fall down
incapable and paralysed through the sense of
its own impotence.

The Rev. Stacey Chapman, of St. Paul’s,
Melbourne, in his foot-note to a sermon on
“ Strikes,” which for some undiscoverable
reason he has seen fit to publish, says—
A fallacy that has gained extraordinary currency
respects the production of wealth—the wealth that be-
comes capital. All wealth, it is insisted, is the product
of labour. Labour should certainly receive what it pro-
duces: the wealth belongs to it accordingly. That is,
the world’s capital is in the wrong hands.—Q.E.D.
Answer.—Assume for the sake of argument, and only
for the sake of argument, that wealth (capital) is the
product of labour; and grant without reservation that
labour should receive what it produces. Whose labour
was it that produced the wealth which has become
capital ? Assuredly it was not the labour of the men who
now talk of division. Wealth (capital) has come down
through scores of generations. So, even on their own
ground, these would-be appropriates have no claim.
They didn’t do the work ; they can’t demand the product.
We might point out to the reverend illogician
that Capital, which in its economic season
simply means the instruments of production, is
not indestructible, but requires to be continually
replaced, and that as a certain amount of the
daily earnings of labour is always appropriated
for that purpose the labourer of to-day is
as truly the producer of capital as was his
father before him, or indeed anyone since Adam
reluctantly became an agriculturist. But, accept-
ing the clerical argument as sound, it becomes
evident that no one, either now or in any prior
generation, ever has or had any right to appro-
priate capital to private uses, and here the
parson has fallen into the hands of the Socialist
who, arriving at this conclusion by a somewhat
different route, asserts that all instruments of
production as well as natural resources should
be used for the benefit of the entire community.
How is it that men so destitute of information
on subjects within the range of mortal intelli-
gence should presume to guide public opinion
in matters where supernatural intelligence is
required ?
Young Countries and Small Jobs.
The Victorian Government, not content with
merely taking the “ martyr” Dow back to its
cast;iron bosom, intends to draw upon the
public nurse for the wherewithal to pay that
restored lamb’s costs in the recent Building
Society prosecutions. Not that any distinction
is to be made in the case of Minister Dow.
Common decency' demands that gander Fer-
ousont at least shall participate in the sauce
intended for the Government goose. Should
other directors if the Premier Permanent
Society succeed in wriggling out of the ruin they
have wrought, their cases will be “ considered ”
with the inevitable result of a further un-
authorised bleeding of the community at large.
Thus much was practically admitted by Chief
Secretary De akin the other evening, in reply to
\ sympathetic enquiry from Munho, a severe
Government critic who had a relative implicated
in that shares charge of which nothing more is
to be heard. The unanimity of Government
and Opposition in regard to the settlement of
whitewashed defendants’ lawyer bills is not
the least beautiful feature of what an ignorant,
scoffing public describe as the Premier job. For
once the Victorian Parliament seems to be an
absolutely united crew, prepared to form a
ring round each official as he escapes
from the nerveless grasp of justice and join
hands in a dance of joy. No dissentient voice
is raised in the unsullied Senate Chamber to
point out that gentlemen who experience the
ill-fortune to be charged with fraud, and the
good fortune to be acquitted, are in the habit
of paying the costs of their defence. No one
referred to the trifling fact that Mr. Dow was
an offender against the laws regulating or not
regulating building societies, during the whole
time he drew a director’s fees from the concern
which came to shameful disaster under his dis-
tinguished patronage and forty shillingsworth
support. All, all agree in considering that the
Premier prosecutions, instituted by an honest
man and supported by the best of legal opinion,
were and are doosidly unpleasant affairs for
the parties most interested, and that the
country should pay for the privilege of behold-
ing them trip from court without a stain upon
their characters.
* * *
Under these circumstances 1) UNO AN Gillies
and Co. deserve to be commended for their
moderation. The Government’s intention is
merely to “consider”—shall we say favourably
consider’—the necessity for paying the bare
expenses of friend Dow and his companions in
injured innocence. Deakin says nothing about
alleviating their sufferings with special grants
from the Crown, or a nice fat pension apiece.
Yet no stupid political prejudices would stand
in the way of such a scheme were it discreetly
mooted. A free prosecution, when one conies
to think over the matter, seems only a natural
corollary to the free railway passes, lunches,
water picnics, and etceteras which members of
Parliament already enjoy. Something more is
required to meet the exigencies of this interest-
ing case. The people of Victoria should be
compelled to come down handsomely for the
absolved directors of that bust-up Building
Society, and the bust-up shareholders are here-
with exhorted to pawn their last pair of boots
on behalf of the' poor fellows who put them
through their savings. Let the Government
motto be—-The whole hog or none. The Bul-
letin grows frivolous, however,
# # *
Until human nature changes for the better we
must expect to find crude, unvarnished jobs of
the P. B. Association kind perpetrated in a very
young country, where every description of in-
fluential person shakes hands with every other
description of influential person, and the powers
that be constitute but a small clique. Senators,
judges, councillors, barristers, and mercantile
‘ ‘ aristocracy ” are all known to one another,
more or less intimately. They eat, drink and
loyalise together. In private life they are
quite near neighbours, they travel to town in
clusters, and cannot follow their daily occupa-
tions without rubbing shoulders at every turn.
They are only men after all—large, fat, average
human beings, pompous in their demeanour
towards outsiders, perhaps, but ‘ ‘ free, easy,
and accessible ” among themselves. They
remember one another in the old days,
on the goldfields, on the wallaby - track.
Many a time have they swilled cold tea from
the same billy-can, before they became rich,
obese, and “representative.” When an espe-
cially fine, respectable swindle opens out, they
are all, or nearly all, fairly in it. A bond of
cousinhood unites them, and if they occasionally
throw aside principles and honour in order to
assist a wounded member of the family at the
expense of justice and other people’s money—
why, are they much worse than we of the lower
orders ? The letting off the rascally municipal
Geddes with three months’ imprisonment and
the official desire to quash all Premier B.A.
prosecutions, are calamities incidental to the
present condition of Victoria. Compare
the public life of an Australian colony with
that of England, where Lord Salisbury
is scarcely on nodding terms with three-fourths
of his own party, and didn’t as much as know
Parnell by sight up to three or four years
ago, at any rate. There the Lord Mayor is an
almost unknown quantity to the judges, and
the judges move in circles apart from politicians,
and very few of the politicians are known to
sassiety. The idea of the whole House of
Commons winking at the proposal to charge a
Cabinet Minister’s lawyer’s bill upon the
country is as absurd as the idea of any Cabinet
Minister investing £2 in a building society and
becoming a director. Equally absurd is the
idea of a London police-court case in which the
defendants, barristers and bench of magistrates
might have all dined together at one table
or met in a Mayor’s ballroom. Australia is as
yet only a small place, when measured by
population, and its jobs seem meaner and more
contemptible than the scandals of an older,
wider civilisation, because they involve a much
larger percentage of leading men, and come
right under the notice of the general public.
As the country grows older it will gradually
become encrusted with solemn hereditary jobs
and sunk in respectable iniquity of long descent.
That is the law of human nature.
To farmers. The codlin-moth’s your
friend —not the short locust.
With the splendid, and indeed over-ripe
old age of 84, Sir Robert Molesworth, Victorian
Judge, has distanced his confreres Stawell, Barry,
Williams, Fellows, and Stephen. Yet 20 years
ago anyone would have booked him for the first to
leave this planet. He had one fearful calamity in
his life, but bravely surmounted it, taking no
notice of hints made to him to resign. We refer
to the divorce case of .Molesworth v. Molesworth
and Ireland. It was the common saying that old
Moley had more law in his little finger than the
rest of the Bench in their whole bodies. His
writing of judgments was a reportorial terror, a
fly crawling out of the inkbottle, on the well-
known little blue sheets of foolscap, tied up with a
blue ribbon at one corner. He preserved his
health by shuffling about five miles daily near his
Hawthorn residence, at the rate of a mile an hour.
Minister for Justice Gould cannot recom-
mend the release of Reseigh Martin sentenced to
two years hard labour for libelling Railway Com-
missioner Eddy. Moral (for the two-thousandth
time); Sentences must be fixed by juries, not by
judges. By the way, it is not very surprising that
this tin-pot god of justice can find no reason for
reducing Martin’s sentence. He has been unable
to find any irregularity in the Mount Rennie
trial.
There are in London alone no less than
60,000 Hebrews, and their income each year is as
nearly as possible eighty-two pounds a head, or
something like £5,000,000 ip the aggregate, while
the average income of the Britisher is something
like £34 a head, so that the Hebraic ones are more
than twice as rich as the native race. Again, as
regards those who are in the possession of ten
thousand a year, the Semitic race tops the natives
more than twenty times over.
Twenty-live years ago Carlyle wrote :
“In no time since the beginning of Society was the lot
of the dumb millions of toilers so entirely unbearable as
it is in the days now passing over us. It is not to die, or
even to die of hunger, that make a man wretched, but to
live, miserable, we know not why : to work sore, and yet
gain nothing ; to be heart-worn, weary, yet isolated, girt
in with a cold, universal laissez faire ; it is to die slowly
all our life long, imprisoned in a deaf, dead, infinite in-
justice, as in the accursed iron belly of a Phalaris bull.”
A quarter of a century has gone past, and stil*
things are much the same to-day.
The member for Braidwood asked Premier
Parkes, in the N.S.W. Assembly, if he intended
to carry out his promise made at Braidwood con-
cerning the construction of a railway to that town ?
Whereupon the political three-card man said that
he “ hoped the member’s question was not the
beginning of his being called to account for every
promise he had made in public meeting,” and then
went on to assert that it was known that he “kept
all promises that should be kept in the interests of
the country.” That is to say, that he bribes con-
stituencies and individuals with lavish promises
and then compounds with his alleged conscience
for the deceit, and puts them off when they
inquire about the fulfilment by asserting that to
keep these promises would be prejudicial to
general interests.
Mr. Bennett Burleigh, the well-known
war-correspondent, at a meeting of London East
End workers said he had found by full personal
investigation that the women who make match-
boxes earned as little as 7s. per week, out
of which they had to pay 4s. 6d. for rent, the
balance being all that was left to supply food and
clothing. The House of Commons lengthily and
solemnly discussed the “preservation of hares,” but
how to preserve human life in the East End
might better have occupied their attention. A
match-box maker who was at the meeting said
she had a dying husband at home and was only
able to earn five shillings weekly, and sometimes
not even so much, on account of being summoned
for not sending her starving children to school.
Even by working until the small hours in the
morning she could not really keep body and soul
together. Several other workers gave their testi-
mony to the same effect, and one woman stated
that she had been twenty years in the trade and
was now worse paid than formerly, the price for
boxes having been reduced from 3d. to 2d. per
gross. Happy England !
Writes a Wellington (N.Z.) correspon-
dent
Dear Bulletin,— Some queer sights have lately been
visible aboard the U.S.S. Co.’s Takapuna when the “ free ”
labourers come off duty on the wharf. During the strike
the company have had to fill all vacancies on their vessels
with more or less amateur sailors, stewards, &0., and
public feeling ran so high in the matter that the men
were compelled to board on the steamer to avoid being
roughly handled by the crowd. Some 200 men are now
as I write located aboard the floating hash-foundry, and
after the coal black and grease have been partially washed
off they all assemble in the cabin to dine. As the com-
pany are short of trained stewards all the new hands have
a turn at waiting upon the “ blacklegs,” amongst whom
are a number of Wellington’s greatest “ toffs ” who happen
to be down in their luck, also such people as a divine who
got struck off the list for not being particular about the
ladies he associated with; a dead-beat M.D., the ceiling
of whose pants has been out of repair for some time ; an
ex-gubernatorial aide-de camp ; a famous embezzling
merchant, a once exquisite masher, still suave and rubi-
cund and healthy, who left Sydney short in his accounts,
after scooping in all his best-natured friends’ available
cash; and a host of ex-bank clerks and other ne’er-do-
wells.
There is in N.S. Wales no more demo-
cratic electorate than West Sydney, one of the four
Assembly seats for which constituency has j ust been
vacated by the death of Mr. Alfred Lamb. The
ghastly mess made by the officials of the labour,'
party in their election arrangements is plainly
attributable in no small degree to the unmanly
jealousies existent between several of the chief
officials of the Trades and Labour Council whose
conduct shows them to be utterly unworthy of
commanding so loyal a body of men as those who
at so great a sacrifice, have unhesitatingly obeyed
their orders in the great strike. The choice of the
delegates fell upon Mr. Brennan after an ex-
haustive ballot, and it then clearly became the
duty of every man owing allegiance to the Trades
and’Labour Gounciltosupport the chosen man even
if he had been a black-fellow ; but what do we find ?
One or two trades aspirants for Parliament, in
submitting their candidature before a ballot, to
the result of which it was understood all would
bow, petulantly and inconsistently announced
their intention to go to the poll at all hazards ;
and after the ballot had been held and Brennan
was before the electors, the men who should have
backed him up as the choice of the labour-
machine, to his face at his public meetings uttered
remarks which discounted his candidature and
showed that the most unworthy and childish
jealousy rankled in their breasts. The Bulletin
doesn’t know Mr. Brennan, and, judging from his
public utterances, it is of opinion that he would
make but a very poor and commonplace Par-
liamentarian ; but then the same remark applies
to all the men who have so selfishly fought for
nomination, and should it eventually prove that
a great labour crisis can, in N.S. Wales, bring
forth no more interesting representatives of hard
graft than they, may Heaven help the toilers’
cause ! Nevertheless, the intrusion of Mr. A. G.
Taylor on the scene as a self-constituted labour-
champion The Bulletin regards as grossly
insolent under the circumstances, for Mr. Taylor
came forward not to courteously offer his services
to the associated workmen—he came as a man
who boldly and bluntly said in effect that what-
ever happened he was going to the poll; would
go there heedless whether he helped or wrecked
the plans of the labour organisations. Judiciously
organised, the labour-party could carry West
Sydney ; as matters stand at time of writing, the
seat promises to fall into the occupancy either of
the erratic Mr. Taylor (who left Parliament a
year or two ago to gnaw a bone flung to him by
Parkes), or into that of some fat nonentity nomi-
nated by the Foreign-trade and Conservative
Association in the interests of “ law and order.”

day in favour of “ Called Back,” when the Brothers
Rignold will appear, for the first time in conjunc-
tion in Australia, as Macari and Ceneri, and Kate
Bishop will play Pauline. Three pieces are in
consideration and preparation to follow, from
which “ Masks and Faces ” may be selected, with
Maggie Moore as Peg Woffington, and then “ The
Merry Wives of Windsor ” may, if there is time
for its production, precede the staging of “Dick ”
at Christmas. On William Rignold’s first Sydney
appearance, we said : “ What a Falstaff he’d
make!”

The poor business at Sydney Royal is due
in part to the prevailing depression, but chiefly
to the thinness of “ Chilperic ” and the fact that
folks have had a surfeit of legs, limelight, slangy
jokes, and tinkly-tura-tum melodies. The Potter-
Bellew audience-ogling, grand mash combination
appear on Saturday night in “Romeo and Juliet,”
which will be followed by “ Hero and Leander,”
their great Melbourne success. Johnny Toole
will then emit a few good old wheezes from the
right-hand corner of his victual entrance close
down to the footlights prior to the production of
“Cinderella,” for which Mr. Musgrave has im-
girted the properties, dresses and music used at
rury Lane in the grand procession during last
pantomime season. By the way, it turns out that
Pantoudes de veir was the original title of this
charming story, but that the individual who
appropriated it for the English mistook the
obscure Latin word veir, which means soft fur, for
verve, the French for glass.

Harry Rickards now fills the bill, and
Sydney School of Arts, with “ Brio-a-Brac,”
popularly known as Break-a-Brick. in which he
sustains seven characters —that of ’Arry, the
London Toff, being a particularly fine, large and
life-like impersonation. The other members of
the company, including Mrs. Rickards, have
each three or four characters allotted to them, and
the whole thing—one of those absurdities, inter-
spersed with song and dance, that makes you
laugh, though reason says “No” —is such a
success that the entrepreneur has had to purchase
a buggy-horse to replace one that broke down
lately on the Randwick-road with the takings.

At Bondi Aquarium, last Saturday, Mile.
Viola unhitched herself from Price’s hot-air soar-
ing-machine at a height variedly estimated from
5000 to 3000 feet, and dropped through the
empyrean with the grace and velocity of a falling-
star on to a sandy patch near Randwiek. This
was the lady’s twelfth Australian air-jump, and,
wind permitting, she will do it again next Satur-
day. For the Sunday concerts, the Wyburd has
engaged the Faust Family, the London Bell-
ringers, Julia Phillips, Harry Leston, W. Cadzow,
and others ; also, the American Midgets for a brief
term, while a party named Jaques Ibbot has
undertaken to fast for forty days. He has our
full permission to eat all night for forty nights.

The Phonograph, which has been doing
good business at Sydney Centenary Hall, plays
there till Saturday, when it skips to Newcastle
for a brief season. Lecturer Archibald informed
his audience the other evening that a melody
played into the instrument by Edison’s band, and
about to be re-produced for their benefit, had
been transcribed from the instrument by a Mel-
bourne musician, scored for the orchestra and
played at Melbourne Opera House for the Sappho
ballet though the authorised score, published in
America, has not yet reached this country. By
the way, there will be a matinee performance on
Saturday at 2.30, for the benefit of the profession
and others unable to visit the show at night.

The phenomenon of an “entirely new
nautical musical burlesque, localised up to date
and adapted for the present occasion,” dumb-
founded a sporting audience at Melbourne
Opera House last Saturday night. Why anything
entirely new should require adaptation, and how
the dickens it could be localised up to the buried
past, or how or wherefore an entertainment came
to be new and altered at the same time, arc ques-
tions that defy explanation equally with the hope-
less drivel they refer to. Ae a matter of fact,


A GHOST
is not a photograph, nor a photo, a ghost—but a good photo, is a
true reflection of the original. For high-art photos, go to the
London Palace of Art, 10 Park-street, Sydney. Country photographers’ work from developement
to completion executed at lowest prices. Bromides a speciality, Staff of artists kept for working up
Wolfe’s Schnapps has no rival.
“ Drink, pretty creature, drink.” What? The
London & Sydney Tea Co.’s pure teas,
“ Little Black-eyed Susan ” is the mutilated
corpse of a forgotten outrage, laid-out afresh in a
patchwork gown of puerile gags, dragged around
the stage to the most contemptible of music-hall
strains by a company consisting of Jennie Lee,
Sheridan, Forde, and a crowd of others, arranged
on a sliding-scale of stupidity. One or other of
the three artists mentioned is never 'away from
the footlights. Generally speaking, they are all
present at one time, flanked by the afore-
said crowd, and there they remain talking
rot, singing rot, and dancing rot until the
capacity of an Australian audience for taking
punishment without so much as a groan is estab-
lished beyond the shadow of a doubt. The
ordinary minstrel show, or pantomime, is a foun-
tain of sparkling novelty and wholesome fun as
compared with “Little Black-Eyed Susan,” and
although this alleged burlesque-which burlesques
nothing—may be adapted differently as it goes
along and improved by omitting a number of
tailors and bookmakers, who come right out of
Bourke-street in walking-costume to drag one
scene down to the level of a threepenny “gaff
yet the idiocy of the whole concern is beyond
redemption. A flabby ballet appears to be
dropped in promiscuously, and a lady described
as a premiere danseune from, Europe adds her
jnelancholy hop to an accumulation of misery
which is advertised to bring a “ brilliant ” season
to a close at the end of next week. But probably
Widow O’Brien will come to the rescue ere that
times expires.

“La Mascotte,” away up at the Princess’,
is fetching the multitude as of old. Maggie Moore
and Elton give the libretto with point and humour.
Kelly, as old man Rocco, is likewise a well-
balanced incident, and May Pollard’s contempt
for her lover Leumane has an air of reality about
it, as though the rolling gait of that tenor songster
filled her with a sweet, womanly desire to throw
a plate at his irritating trunk every time he
jerks it forward in caricature of a courtly
obeisance. Leumane grows very desolate and dree-
like of late. He and the ultra-vigorous Knight-.
Aston should club their anatomies together
and divide the proceeds in equal proportions, A
co-operative system would tend to their mutual
advantage, because the one wants toning up,
whilst the other stands in urgent need of toning
down. On Saturday the long-expected “ Gon-
doliers ” put in an appearance, and the full
strength of the old company will be freshened by
some new faces,

The first night of “Harvest,” at the Bijou,
is fixed for Thursday (23rd), consequently “Ours”
has already ceased to be. Maud Williamson,
graciously loaned by the elder Firm, makes her
first appearance with the B. and B. company, and
Fanny Enson comes back after, as it is stated, a
six months’ absence. Ternpus fugit —fugits at a
fearful rate.

Bland Holt, too, makes a change at the
Alexandra on Saturday, after a cheerful innings
with “ London, Day by Day.” The name of the
coming drama is “ The Land of the Living,” and
sounds suitable to a time of the year when Mel-
bourne is not a little bit like a cemetery. The
“books,” bless ’em ! seldom fail to effect a “land”
of the unfortunate living during Cup week.

At the Royal there was a pitiable state of
things all last week and on until Tuesday night,
When the English C pera season was to break up
with the hollow mockery of a “benefit” to Mr.
Martin Simonsen, who had played audiences
down very low. At present “ Jim the Pen-
man,” with St. Maur, Christie Murray, and an
otherwise shaky support, is filling the deadly
breach, but for Derby night Messrs. W. and G.
promise “The English Rose” and one or two new
performers.

The Victoria Hall is doing well, also the
Gaiety, Waxworks, &c., and the Cyclorama has
just adduced another proof of its vitality in the
form of a3O per cent, dividend. There was some
sense in the Battle of Waterloo, after all, although
it paid a dashed small dividend at the time to
anybody except the Iron Dock. His second
descendant—or great nephew, or something—is
collaring £lOO,OOO a year and free lodgings from
the British tax-payer to-day. Fancy getting all
that lot because your great uncle used to hide be-
hind a tree while his myrmidons fired low and laid
’em out, and for sixpence a day, too !

“Gratitude,” one of Christie Murray’s
new plays, was matineed at Melbourne Opera
House on Monday, with results which bode hurt
and mischief to the author in the event of his in-
flicting this lugubrious, inconsecutive sermon
Upon the dear old mother country. The idea seeth-
ing in Mr. Murray’s somewhat heavy head when
he ground out “ Gratitude ” was that some people
are not duly thankful for favours received, and
other people run to. the opposite extreme. He
works out this inspiration in four foolish acts full
of dull conversation and puerile situations.
Characters come in at one door, go out
at another, and return by a different pas-
sage, for the mere purpose of being there
in couples when the previous couple have
cleared out for the moment. They disclose
secrets to one another without due cause, and
they all talk like penny tracts, except a comic
servant, who acts as escape-valve for Christie
Murray’s spirits when they begin to bubble up
amidst the gloom of his moral purpose. In a
word, “ Gratitude ” is a bad attempt at a play—
weak in construction, dialogue and character, and
although this notice necessarily terminated at the
second act, the fact that it had to catch the
express train was felt to be a blessing. The
author seemed to shape well as an “ old man ”
actor in an uninteresting character, and George
Carey tried not to be too tiring as the nuisance
who is continually grateful. Most of the acting,
however, would have settled any sort of play. To
make matters worse they all seem imperfect in
their parts, the leading lady actually talking such
stuff as—“ The live rose blooms on the tree, but
the withered bud drops where it fell.”

It was suggested by the Adelaide press
that Mrs. Potter, of New York, and Kyrle
Bellew should give recitations at the Town Hall
on the last Saturday of their stay, so that the
church people should sec them, and the Governor
offered to take the chair, but they had to come on
to Sydney to prepare for their opening, and so the
unco-guid missed an opportunity of gazing witli
horror on these much-petted vanities.

The one really humorous feature of the
late show at Melbourne Opera House was Horace
Bent, as good old Uncle Tom. A long course of
Christy - minstrelry has blunted the edge of
Horace’s pathos, and when he assumed an atti-
tude of prayer and requested the other slaves to
ioin him in a maudlin hymn the house experienced
a strange sense of something wanting. You see,
he didn’t wear a gigantic collar, or beat time with
a baggy blue gingham. The restraining influence
of stage traditions prevented him from favouring
the Loard with a stump speech. Yet his desire
to do all these things twinkled in the four corners
of Horace’s eyes and made him a heap funnier
than e ver. It was a pity the management couldn’t
give him more scope. When Grade Whiteford
lay dying, and everybody was doubled up by the
thought of losing such a little Eva, what wouldn’t
one have given to hear Horace fire off a forlorn
kind of “yoick,” as he thumped his skull with a
tambourine ? Or he might have wagged his tow-
wig at the fullgrown angel-child and said, “ O
Christmas ! ”

It is not generally known that William
Archer, now the leading London dramatic critic,
comes of a stock of Australian pioneers, being the
son of Thomas Archer, the Agent-General for
Queensland, one of the Archers, of Gracemere,
Rockhampton. The future authority on the stage
had a turn at bush-whacking up North some years
ago, but a very short experience removed all illu-
sions as to that mode of life, and he soon returned
to London. The present writer can well remember
being present at a debate which took place a good
many years ago on the morality of theatre-going
at the students’ debating society at Edinburgh
called the “Philomathic.” On that occasion a
young student named William Archer made his
maiden speech, and it was such an eloquent vindi-
cation of the theatre that its detractors were
ignominiously defeated. His next exploit was the
pamphlet on Irving, which, whatever its views
may have been, was at least criticism and not the
diluted hogwash so often served out as such. It
is Archer’s method to avoid as much as possible per-
sonal acquaintance with those whom he criticises,
in order that he may not be even unconsciously
influenced by personal considerations. His
Ibsenish proclivities may be ascribed in great
measure to the influence of early training in
Norway, where the family have connections and
interests.

Olympia still flourishes at Melbourne
Exhibition Building, but the public animus
against Texas Jack and his Wild West Show
seems to be chronic. That young man’s notion of
a rational entertainment would disgrace the
mental capacity of a goat. One dreadful speci-
men of his brain-work is a drama described as
“The Horse Thief.” Somebody disguised as a
larrikin loafs out on the tan-track prairie with a
triangular horse, and gammons to be wrapped in
slumber with his head on the animal’s broken
ribs, after which a second fellow picks up the
four-legged ruin and takes it nowhere in particular
until four other fellows cease spitting at the far
end of the prairie and proceed to lynch the burglar
of dog’s-meat by dangling him from the electric
light by a bit of string. Then they walk away and
the horse staggers back to his stall to see if he can
find a stray oat, and Texas Jack comes wobbling
out of the stable-yard on his wild broncho. When
Johnny arrives at the man on the string he doesn’t
let the victim down easy, as a lucid cow-boy
would, but he clambers off his 13-hands steed and
commences to blaze away at the strihg with a
blunderbuss until the robber drops down of
his own accord and wanders quietly off to
the cow-shed as though nothing had occurred.
Whereupon the people who have paid a
shilling, shout “Yah!” and Texas Jack bows
his acknowledgments. Another drama consists
of an omnibus being attacked by Indians,
and rescued by Jack and his cowboys, assisted by
a pen’orth of crackers fired off by the manage-
ment. The only solid incident in this scene is the
’bus. Nobody sets much store by the cowboys or
savages because they are generally understood to
be a mob of barrackers from Prahran, those with
feathers gummed on their legs acting as untamed
heathens, and the others pretending to be more
civilised. A prairie flower wearing pink tights
and spangles, casts her maiden smile around the
inside of the ’bus fora bit, but ultimately becomes
a bone of contention in distress until Texas Jack
swoops down as usual and the Wild West Show
dribbles into oblivion. The whole concern is an
entertainment which seems worth a shilling for
saying “dam” to, and as an excuse for insulting
behaviour with extenuating circumstances—not to
mention the canoodling possibilities hinted at in
last week’s number—it ought to catch on like a
lobster,

The Age’s attack on Maggie Moore was so

A company of Melbourne musicians went
down some time ago to give a concert in Geelong.
Madame Schiller and her brother were of the
crowd. The brother was told off to look after
Madame’s boxes containing evening dress, music,
&c. Dinner at Geelong over at 7.30. Concert
billed for eight. At former hour, boxes missing.
Had been labelled “ Adelaide ! ” Brother sent off
on a wild search after a dress. At 9 o’clock, he
found a squatter’s daughter who was persuaded by
her pa to lend her oldest finery. Madame played
some noise from memory, and the uninitiated said
they had never seen her so well-dressed before.
The concert lasted barely an hour, and the same
musicians have never been there since.

Miln says that Mrs. Potter is now twenty
times more of an actress than when he saw her in
America, and Mrs. Potter could return the com-
pliment, no doubt. There is a great similarity
between the two cases. The lady walked out of a
sassiety drawing-room, just as Miln descended
from a pulpit, to play “star” characters on the
stage, and they have both been starring ever since.
The tragedian’s parishioners were left like sheep
without a shepherd, and Potter —well, he seems to
be a shepherd without his pet lamb.

The final appearance of Mrs. Gown-Trotter
and Mr. Curly Blew at Adelaide was a veritable
triumph, for, perhaps, never in the history of the
theatre has such an enormous crowd assembled
within its walls. “Romeo and Juliet” provided
the cause of all this unusual and superfluous
excitement, and to assist matters Inman was
specially imported to play Mercutio. The manage-
ment must have a handsome profit on hand as a
result of the season. G. C. Miln’s term is only
for nine nights, with a fresh morsel of Shakespeare
each evening. Louise Jordan, W. J. Montgomery,
Oily Peering, Athol wood, Carle, etc., support the
tragedian.
The principal baritone of an Australian
comic opera Co. appeared with his right arm in a
sling the other evening. To the many questions
as to the cause, he told the history of a Sunday
excursion and a snake-bite; “but it was only a
whip-snake (!) and so no harm was done.” After
the performance a knot of friends stopped a well-
known comedian who was keeping dark on the
weather bow with a handkerchief round his
face. In answer to anxious queries, he had
fallen asleep while reading in the garden,
and been bitten by a snake. “ It’s really nothing,
a whip-snake, you know.” In a popular club the
conductor was beheld with a wreath of twisted
“hanky” and a bump upon his brow; “Hullo,
my boy, is it new opera or too much hat ?” “ Oh,
nothing much, I was out camping yesterday, fell
asleep and woke up with this disfigurement. They
tell me it is caused by the bite of a whip-snake.”
The good-natured individual who stepped in
between the big baritone and the band-box con-
ductor is most to be pitied.

The four or five members of the Victorian Orchestra
who make periodical dives into the interior under the
title of the Melbourne Concert Company tell some funny
stories of their experiences out of town. On one occasion
they had a crowded house of six, and one of the instru-
mentalists had to stand in the ticket-office ready to return
the money taken, while a lady who was “ably assisting”
warbled “ Dear Love, how hard that we must part I ”
Warner has no opportunities in the new play of “A

J. C. Williamson has engaged a splendid scenic artist,
Phil. Goatcher, from New York, and his first paintings
will appear in “The Gondoliers,” at Melbourne Princess’.
Goatcher is even a consolation for Gordon, and the legiti-
mate successor of Voegthn, Denim, and Matt. Morgan in
the States, as witness his magnificent scenery for Robson
and Crane’s “ Comedy of Errors.”
Spagnoletti writes: “Yes, Charley Mathews’ son was
very mysterious, yet not so mysterious as Mr. Murray
Herbert in the suite. He was a good young man, who
died after acting in Woodcock’s ‘ Little Game,’ with Mr.
and Mrs. Mathews at the Melbourne Royal. Y r oung Chas.
Mathews must, of course, not be confounded, as a barris-
ter, with Home Secretary Matthews. Old Charles never
could bear to go about without the boy, who could not
have come out of any industrial school. Besides, he was
a perfect little gentleman, like Affable Hawk.”
They say now that Williamson and Garner won’t go in
again for the lesseeship of the Melbourne Royal. Garner
will shunt for a turn at the Mabille side of the globe, the
top antipodes, while J. Cassius cribs at the Princess’, and
will with difficulty be restrained from acting a bit. Un-
doubtedly the outcome, independent managers all round,
will be better even than the good there has been.
Vastly amusing is the complaint of, perhaps, the fore-
most English contralto on the Oratorio stage, as to the
approaching necessity of her appearance in opera, and in
parts like Maffio Orsini, in “Lucregia Borgia,” and the
page Urbain, in the “ Huguenots.” A friend said it was
distressing to have to compress the female form divine
into hoys’ parts, because you only look like a holster done
up, and not a bit like a boy. “ No,” replied the contralto,
“ the mischief is that my figure is that of a perfect hoy,
and this is the deception to be discovered !” 800, boo !
Critic Archer went to the Ober-Ammergau Passion
Play, discussing it on the spot with Mrs. Bancroft, and
trying to piece up a cast on the London stage. Of course
there could be no question as to who should enact what is
called the Protagonist part, but they could not settle it as
to who was qualified to replace Sara Bernhardt. Archer
won’t enlighten his readers further on the details of his
cast, though they had assigned parts to Pilate, Herod and
Judas.
Chas. Mathews said to Jefferson, “Why, you are only

The damsel may be called Warded, out of compliment to

Delaney, the well-known musician, and Hinchy, the
amateur tenor, were walking Pitt-street, Sydney, the
other day, when they were asked by a couple of Union
men for assistance. Hinchy gave one of them a shilling,

time on your hands I don’t mind teaching you the

A Gaiety dnnsense once telegraphed to the stage-
manager:—“Cannot come to rehearsal; met my uncle
in the Strand last night." The message ought to havf
read “hurt my ankle.”
Edwin Thorne, now again in Sydney, has some idea of
organising a company to play at the Gaiety. He says
that Australians “are so glutted, gorged, stuffed, and
surfeited with good things that a manager can’t stagger
them. When with Bland Holt we travelled with 200 tons
of scenery, but I found that effects which would have
brought down the house in New York were taken as a
matter of course in Brisbane and Adelaide !”
Sara Bernhardt travels with forty-eight trunks, exclu-

fixed round with pegs so that they can’t be shaken or
crushed. Her travelling wardrobe altogether weighs
nearly three tons.
Charley Warner's’real name is Lickfold ; he is the sou
of a provincial actor, was intended for an architect, and
made his first start in stage life, at Henley, in “ Bras
Rouge.” He then succeeded Irving in the Batemans’
company and from that time was associated most fre-
quently with Samuel Phelps.
H. Vincent West, who so successfully piloted the
Wangenheim Opera Company through Queensland despite
strikes and floods, is now engaging artistes in Sydney for
the buxom Emma to take part in a Brisbane season, open-

Says a London writer Personally, Charles Warner
is one of the most popular of men among his brother
actors. Without a trace of the self-conscidusness or con-
ceit which might, perhaps, be pardoned to one who,
though hardly yet in middle life, has reached the summit
of his profession. A keen sportsman, a bold rider to
hounds, a genial friend and companion, the soul of
generosity to the members of his profession less fortunate
than himself, Charles Warner is the beau ideal of a manly
English gentleman on the stage.” Thanks.
A London paper says that Johnny Toole, having a
theatre of his own, and being a rich man, was foolish
to run the risk of coming to Australia. He ran no risk ;
is too old a bird for that. On the contrary, he received, it
is said, £BOO weekly, for which sum he supplied a by no
means sparkling company, mediocre plays and some not
altogether paralysing acting.
The betting concerning the lesseeship of Melbourne
Royal is strong on Warner, who told everybody that he
would soon be back as a manager, and, of course, he had
“the office” from W. and G. about their clearing out.
For many reasons they would prefer him as a rival to any-
one else, and it is evident he has not struck Babylon
’twixt wind and water. Dampier, it is said, is seized with
that restlessness and desire to get on to a bigger thing
which never allows the entrepreneur to “ take it easy.”

The Shearers’ Keg.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
“Now then, lads, give it a name, I’m stuck,
but I’m blowed if I thought old Billy could ’a
done it. Billy, ole man, I don’t play you no more
games level; twenty out of a ’undred is what I
want from you next time. Come along, old ’uu,
and wet your luck.” Saying which Mr. John
Bagus, landlord of “The Shearers’Arms,” put
his cue in the rack, ducked under the little half-
door that led into the bar, folded his arms on the
counter, and again pleaded with his audience to
“give it a name.”
A scrupulously clean man was Johnny Bagus>
physically, and his bar reflected in every detail
this one pleasing peculiarity of its master. A
room about fourteen feet square, with two
counters, one facing the billiard-room, the other
the bar-parlour, the two remaining sides being
shelved to the ceiling and loaded with gaudily-
labelled bottles, except in one corner where a
small door, decorated with an iron gating about a
foot square, opened into the “ dead-house,”
or temporary asylum for “drunks,” a skillion-
room with another iron gating in place of
a window, furnished with wooden bunks at the
sides, and a case supported by four legs driven
into the earthen floor to serve as a table. Casks
of beer, wines and spirits were ranged under the
bar counters on both sides, and under the tap of
each was a bright pewter measure to catch the
drippings. “ Sukey,” the black gin, a member of
Mrs. Bagus’ domestic staff, scrubbed out the bar
and put things straight the first thing every
morning under the supervision of Sam Golden
the barman, for, as Johnny used to say
“the missus can do what she likes with the
rest o’ the ’house but thisyer bar is where I makes
the spondulix what’s goin’ to put Johnny Bagus
tip top some o’ these yer days, when he’s
a-goin’ to be a J.P., and carry the plate round
among the parson’s lambs, and ’ave a ’orty French
guv’ness for the little Baguses, and by Jingo it's
got to be clean or sumthin’s goin’ to ’appen. ”
The beauty-spot of the room, though, was a
white enamelled earthenware keg, of about ten
gallons, with alternate hoopiugs of blue and yellow
at each end, and in the centre a Vermillion scroll
bearing in large golden letters the legend “The
Shearers’Keg.” By all the shearers and station-
hands up and down the river and away on the
back-blocks the rum drawn from that keg was
held to be superior to the best obtainable on the
Bendigo, or even in Melbourne. Johnny himself
described it as; “The best ole West Ingy rum,
the same as they ’as for christenin’s in Windsor
Castle. It come out of a pirates’ cave what they
found on one o’ them there islands nigh on to a
acre and a-’alf deep. A huncle o’ mine what’s a
bishop over there sends it to me straight; it’s
more’n 50 overproof, and I ’as to water it a bit,
else you couldn’t swaller it, ’cause it ’ud just
scorch the gizzard outen yer. There ain’t more’n
enough in the cave to last another year, and
there’s chaps out a-prospectin’ for another plant
all the time.”
Sain, the barman, had heard that yarn repeated
at intervals for over two years, but it always
made him feel hot, and angry, and thirsty, and
full of a desire to take Bagus by the throat and
choke him, if his poor, shaky, nerveless fingers
had been equal to the task; but he was only the
wreck of a man who had once been Lieutenant
Samuel Golden, cashiered from H. M.
Regiment by the verdict of a courtmartial for
haying been drunk on duty a week after the
allied troops landed in the mud at the head of
the little winding creek dignified by the name of
Balaclava Harbour. A weak and decaying
remnant of a gentleman was “ the Capting,” as
Bagus called him, who was allowed one nip
before breakfast and not another drop until after
four o’clock, when Johnny took charge of the bar
and Sam cleared out to his little room behind the
store and was seldom seen again till next day.
About 14 men rolled up for the offered shout,
exclusive of two who were in the dead-house. Five
or six of them were knocking down their shearing
cheques, and the others were principally township
loafers and “brokers,” encouraged by Johnny
for the purpose of assisting them. Bogolong Billy
had only come in that morning from the Murrum-
bidgee, with the result of ten months’ shepherding
and a ringer’s score at the shed, in his pocket, but
he didn’t mean to stop :
“No fear, mate. I’m a-goin’ through to
Eaglehawk this time, take my oath for it.
On’y I thought I’d just camp here to-night and
say good-bye to the boys and get away agin afore
sun-up to-morrer.” To which Mr. Bagus replied
“ Right y’ar. Billy, and I’ll hev yer ’oss up and
feed ’im fust thing, and call yer myself if yer
dosses it out too long. But yer’d better give me
any cheques or joolry yer’ve got so’s I kin lock it
up for yer, in case some o’ these yer chaps should
take a fancy to go through yer, don’t yer know.”
“Thet’s all right, Johnny. I ain’t a-goin’ to
lush, and I ain’t a-goin’ to stop, and the cheque is
sewed inter my trowsis and I shan’t take ’em off,
so ther ain’t no fear. ”
“ Well, jest as yer like, ole man. Come on now
and I’ll play yer a game o’ billiards on the new
table. Let’s see—we didn’t have no table the last
time yer was down, did we? No, course we didn’t.
I can t play much myself yet, and I ’spect yer can
beat me, Billy, so we won’t ’ave nothin’ on the
game, on’y drinks.” And Bogolong Billy, who
knew as much about billiards as he did about the
belts of Saturn, played with the man who could
make a sixty-break on the spot when it pleased
him, and —won it.
“ Now, boys, let’s ’ave these yer drinks, and
I’m a-goin’ to take twenty from Billy and try and
put ’im through. Hurry up, Capting, and take
some o’ these gentlemen’s orders.”
Just then a roar of laughter went up from the
other end of the counter, where Billy had an-
nounced his determination to adhere to “sass-
parell ” as a beverage, but the storm of chaff was
checked by a remonstrance from Mr. Bagus :
“Why, Billy, ole man, what’s come over yer?
Not but what any man can call for what he likes
at this yer bar when it’s my shout, but if it was
me, Billy, and a-startin’ on the road at daylight
too, I wouldn’t do it. That sort o’ rot-gut ain’t
good for a man like you. Take a little drop outen
the kag, ole son, then yer knows what yer a
drinkin’ of.”
And “ a little drop outen the kag ” it was. Hive
or six rounds followed in quick succession, and
Sam in the rush of business was expectorating
wildly on the floor, until Mr. Bagus gravely
observed : —“Oapting Golding, it seems to me, as
I’ve told you many times, that I don’t allow no
man nor women born to spit on rny bar-floor.
Ain’t them pewter pots good enough fer yer,
that’s what I want to know? Yer a man o’
birth and breedin’, ain’t yer ? Well, see ’ere
now, there ain’t no false pride about me, I’m
on’y Johnny Bagus, born on a doorstep in the
Whitechapel Road, reared by ’and in the
I oundlin, eddioated at Pentonville, and lagged
for refoosin* to drink the Queen’s ’ealth at the
Lord Mayor’s dinner. Yer never know’d me
guilty of such designin’ contrariness, and I’ve got
n igh on to three thousand golden quid in the
bank, blast yer, in this year o’ Manner Dominy
eighteen thousand and fifty-eight. Go ter bed,
yer boozy owl, and don’t provoke me to say things
to yer as I wouldn’t like these gentlemen to ’o«r.”
* # #
At 1 a .m., when the last light was turned
out by Mr. Bagus, that gentleman was the only
sober male person on the premises of “ The
Shearers’ Arms.” Bogolong Billy and three
others were in the deadhouse alongside the two
previous occupants. Billy’s cheque, amounting
to £97 17s. 6d., was in Mr. Bagus’ pocket, and
HE WASN’T TIRED.
GOOD CLERGYMAN: “WHY DO YOU PLAY MARBLES, MY LITTLE BOYS,
ON THE BLESSED DAY OF REST?”
THE WICKEDEST BOY: “DAY OF REST, WHAT ARE YOU GIVIN’ US?
WHY, WE AIN’T TIRED.”
on the back of the bar-shutter was a cuneiform
inscription done in billiard chalk, which, on
being translated for entry into the day-book the
following morning, clearly showed that £23 14s.
of that sum was due by the owner for refresh-
ments supplied to his order during the day.
At (1 a.m. Sam was in the bar according to
custom to superintend Sukey’s cleaning operations.
Mr. Bagus also appeared to take a hand in the
game by replenishing the keg, which bad been
emptied the previous night. That gaudy recep-
tacle for hell-broth was placed on the floor, a large
bung at the top removed, two figs of sheepwash
tobacco broken up small and dropped in, and
followed by the contents of all the pewter
measures, which comprised tap-drippings for the
week of beer, wine and spirits, and the incidental
surplus saliva for that time of the man who chewed
andthemanwhosmoked; next, four gallons of over-
proof rum, some 20 or 30 drops of a thick white
liquid out of a small bottle produced from Mr.
Bagus’ breast-pocket, and the remaining space
filled up with water. The mop was snatched
from Sukey’s hand, the handle inserted in the keg,
and a few vigorous turns mixed the various in-
gredients that together produced that delicious
compound on which the fame of the house mainly
rested. Half-an-hour afterwards there was .a
commotion in the dead-house, Sam drew back the
wooden shutter and the face of Bogolong Billy
appeared at the small iron-grating :
“Is that you, Sam? Quick for the love o’
’eaven, and gimme a drink. My throat's blistered,
and my head’s afire, and I’ve been in hell all
night. Where’s Bagus ? Let me out o’ this so’s
I can get down to the water-hole and put it out! ”
“ Here you are, old man. Bagus has got the
key, but he’ll be in directly. Here’s a ‘ doctor ’
for you, and you just lie down and keep quiet till
he comes.” And a gurgling hiss told that the
“doctor” had disappeared. Billy was re-
placed at the grating by the other thirsty
souls inside, for whom the prescription was
repeated at intervals until they all went to sleep
again. About 11 o’clock Bagus let them out and
Mrs. Bagus had a kettle of soup ready for any
demands. Then the fun began again and lasted
far into the night as before, and the evening and
the morning were the second day.
# # *
So live days passed, during which one man
wandered away into the bush in “the horrors,”
and one fell into the kitchen fire trying to get a
light for his pipe ; he was sent on to the doctor at
the township in a spring cart, fairly sober but
partially skinless, with a message from Bagus
that he had “had a fit.” And presently it came
to Billy’s turn :
“Well, yer know, Billy, I ain’t a ’ard man, and
yer can ’ave what rashuns yer want to take yer
back to the station, and a bottle o’ the real stingo
out o’ the ‘ kag ’to ’elp yer on the road. But yer
shouldn’t ’a done it, Billy. I tried all I could to
stop yer, and it weren’t no good ; yer would ’ave
it, and yer would keep on shoutin’ for all ’ands
every time, till I ses to the missus, ses I, ‘ I never
seen sich a man as Bogolong Billy. He’s the
most blarstedest deterrmnest cove as ever come
into this ’ouse.’ You arst ’er if I didn’t.”
“And what about the ’oss, Johnny, and the
saddle and bridle?”
“ Well, yer sold him to Sam, yer know for ten
quid, and the missus ’erself did ’er level best to
stop yer doin’ that, but I never did see such a
chap as you are, Billy—no, I never did, true’s
I’m a livin’ man.”
* * #
Six weeks afterwards, all that the native
dogs had left of Bogolong Billy was buried by a
sheep-drover near the Pine Ridge, on the Old
Man Plain. There was no public-house there in
those days, and no water within twenty miles.
Bagus fell out of a buggy, and was swept away
and drowned in the big flood that came years
after, and his name was on the list for a J.P.-ship
at the time it happened.
I am able to give all the particulars connected
with the brew of the shearers’ keg, because I kept
Bagus’ books for a month, and was in and out of
the bar a good deal and saw it all myself.

Roundabout.
Some two years ago an Auckland soli-
citor, moved by unwonted compassion—or, per-
haps, being intoxicated—gave a sovereign to a
young woman in great distress, and then lay low
till Providence should send him his reward." Tij e
unaccustomed emotion which went through him
on that honourable occasion nearly blew his head
off, and often, in after days, the memory of that
good action warmed his soul and made him feel
better. And on a certain disastrous Friday last
month his benevolence bore fruit, and his good
deed was returned to him a hundred-fold. A
respectable old gentleman with white hair called
in and told him that the woman in question was
his erring daughter, now happily restored to him,
and then he broke down and wept so copiously on
the table that he became unintelligible for nearly 15
minutes. At last, however, he revived, and blew
his nose, and,smothered the feelings which—in his
capacity as a father —threatened to overcome him,
and explained that he had come to refund the
twenty shillings. Business being bad, and his
office-rent in arrears, the lawyer gladly assented,
and then the overwhelmed parent gave him a bad
£5-note with tears in his eyes, and prayed that the
God of Abraham, Isaac and the other fellow
might bless him while he collared the change.
Two hours later the benefactor got on to the
situation, and then he blew the window out with
his language, and tore the poker in two, and had
to drag all his clothes off to avert suffocation, and
fly round the room with nothing on except his
eyeglass. Next time he is called upon to do a
benevolent action he intends to restrain himself if
he has to climb over his mother’s dead body tc
do it.

A vigilant policeman was shaking the solid
earth with his hoofs in Heffernan’s Lane, Mel-
bourne, one morning last week, when a strange-
looking object met his eye and made him pull up.
It was leaning against a dead wall and looked
like a smashed umbrella covered with old cat’s-
meat—at least it looked as much like that as any.
thing else, but it had no very striking resemblance
to any object that the officer had ever seen or
heard of before. His first idea was to rush iq
and arrest the spectre, but more prudent counsels
prevailed and he hovered round. Then the object
began to look like a shattered harp with ribbon tied
all over it, but when the constable escaped to the
back of it and viewed it from the rear it seemed tc
be a very old corpse in rags. Finally he threw
his baton at it and exclaimed, “ Spake, ye
monkey ! ” and the exploded goblin turned round
and said, “ Ching a ring chow ; hang lee.” That
explained the matter. It was a leper, and the
officer clutched it on a charge of being in a public-
place with intention to commit a felony. He
seized it by the shoulder, but when two pounds of
the heathen spook came away in his grasp he let
go with a yell. It was evident the object couldn’t
stand strong measures, and requited to be arrested
with caution. He got it to the lock-up at last,
however, by running behind it and yelling and
throwing stones, and shaking a stick at it;
and the nefarious thing created a sensation
m court next morning. Nobody knew what
to do with it or where to put it, and as it
couldn’t be fixed, or hung, or bound over to keep
the peace, the Bench at last resolved to send it up
for twelve months, and give it a chance to infect
the other prisoners. The leper is a difficult
problem to contend with. Anybody who wants
to understand the obstacles with which he is sur-
rounded should read the gruesome story of Hanno,
the Carthaginian, in that blood-stained novel,
“ Salammbo.” The revolted Mercenaries tried to
settle a complicated problem in his case by cruci-
fying the obnoxious monopolist in his last stage of
decay ; but even that violent device was only a
partial success, for he flew to pieces on the cross,
and in half-an-hour all that was left was six old
scraps hanging on nails, and a hunk of skin
deposited on the ground. The only wholesome
expedient is to chase the patient into the sea
whenever his complaint is fully developed, and
leave him to be scavengered away by the lobster
and carnivorous prawn. To let him die in a cell,
and then confine anybody—even a fraudulent
Rechabite, or a colonel who wants to “fire low ”
—in it afterwards, is cruelty worthy of the
Inquisition or the Council of Ten in its palmiest
days.

There are almost as many dangers about
being a private detective as there arc" in being a
Social Purity officer, and sacrificing one’s eye in
the cause of Terewth. Last week a lady residing
at Moonee Ponds (Vic.), hired one of these obser-
vant persons to inspect the goings-on of the old
man and see if his morals were particularly
correct, and with the genius of his tribe he
muddled the job and got into trouble. His plan
of campaign was to consider the patient through
the window and the keyhole, and by way of
corroboration he took no less than three respectable
Christian friends along with him—gentlemen
whose testimony would stand inspection if it was
necessary to swear to anything bad. They went
along together after dark, and if the party could
have climbed the wall quietly all would have been
right, but unhappily the Christians were short
and thick and fat, and couldn’t jump over two-
pennorth of eggs. Moreover, one of them had to
sneeze violently on top of the wall, and next
moment the defendant rushed out with a stick
and hit everybody on the head. He struck out in
all directions with the unreasoning frenzy of a
wild beast, and in about two minutes the whole
party was swelled up to such an extent through
assault and battery that it couldn’t have got
through a gate, and was so much disfigured as to
be unfit for human inspection. The whole four
were in a fair way to be killed, only their assailant
fainted from excitement and over-exertion, and
they got their second wind and retreated on
crutches to the hospital, leaving the field of battle
to the victor, and also the spoils of war—four
shattered hats, two walking-sticks, the atoms of
an umbrella, a maimed eye-glass, a flattened
respirator, a prayer-book, one golosh, and part of
the back of a human head. Next day the conqueror
organised himself afresh, and charged upon the
detective with a summons, and that energetic
public servant was fined £3 and costs. Any
further evidence against the old man will be
collected with a telescope, or else a would-be
suicide will call upon him and chance the con-
sequences.

who dresses well—as male apparel goes—and lias
a certain air of seeming to be out on the heavy
mash. Not being married, either, he is naturally
entitled to behave as such.
“Wales” was gambling at Monte Carlo
when a charming Americaine came along, and
promptly remarked : “ Why, there’s Albert
Edward, to be sure ! Whatever would his Ala
say?” For one brief second she made Airs, Great
Britain’s heir actually blush.
About the most roundly-abused man in
8. Australia just now is Parson Gilmore, who
preaches advanced Socialism to the workman and
has had countless threats of dismissal from his
stewards. Gilmore was at one time an agricul-
tural labourer in England and is self-educated,
John Thomson, of Keilambete, the well-
gilt Victorian squatter, lately deceased, was in his
youth a schoolmaster, and a veritable martinet.
Phis probably accounts for the high-handed,
peremptory way he managed things at his station.
His early life was spent at Tasmania, where he
landed when a mere child.
Returning from the Derby, Labouchere
lost the chief of his party who had the tickets and
couldn’t gain admission to the station, till he
followed the example of a fat, florid person who
said with dignity, “Where is the Royal train ? ”
and was at once admitted without a ticket and
with many bows and directions.
Cardinal Newman, in his “Apologia,”
says he had almost made up his mind to celibacy
at 20, but on two occasions after that he was
seized with doubt, though he ultimately made his
resolve at the age of 30, which was 15 years before
he changed his church. He therefore lacked the
experience of his widower friend, Cardinal
Manning.
The Australasian asserts that Mr. Edward
Gerald Fitzgibbon, Town Clerk of Melbourne, is
a lineal descendant of the first Earl of Desmond,
head of the White Knights of -the Geraldines, a
sept so-called from the colour of their hair.” It
18 high time the great man founded a new family
with a title bearing some reference to the pungency
M Smellbourne stinks.
Sir Francis Murphy, now in his 82nd year,
when _ retiring from the Victorian Speakership
was given a bonus of £3OOO. Peter Lalor got
£4OOO. Charles Gavan Duffy was content with a
Ministerial pension of £lOOO, which he has now
enjoyed for over 25 yeai-s. Sir Charles MacMahon
got nothing, and Speaker Davies is so rich that
he won’t expect anything.
Prof. Thorold Rogers, whose death is
cabled, was the model for Dickens’ Gradgrind, in
“Hard Times,” and was, perhaps, the great
novelist’s most unjust portrait. The drawing was
more distorted and the colouring less true than
Leiorh Hunt's (“ Harold Skimpole ”) and Laing
as Fang, the Police-Magistrate in “ Oliver Twist.”
Laing relieved many a poor wretch from his own
pocket.
The Prince of Wales is alleged to have
relapsed into a despondent state again. JuJat
present he finds no joy in pretty Yankee girls,
regards eating and drinking as mere vanities,
wearies of dropping his money at whist, and. in a
general sort of way, wishes himself dead. When
Carington comes to call upon poor Tummy he will
probably discover the royal ruin immersed in a
treatise upon diseased livers.
George A ugustus Sala is giving the Argus
just what the heart of that slow and stately
journal hankers after. Amidst much drivel con-
cerning Australian weather, flowers, trees, ko.,
good old G.A.S. remarks in parenthesis that
“ strikes and strikers, trades-halls, and agitating
humbugs are but phantoms that will pass.” Which
reminds us that tire fat journalist is not a phantom,
and lie doesn’t pass nowadays.
The N.S.W. Legislative Assembly has
had, since the inauguration of Responsible
Government, seven Speakers. The first, Sir
D mini Cooper, was a wealthy merchant; the
second, SirT. A. Murray (dead), a retired squatter;
the third. Sir John Hay. a squatter and banker ;
the fourth, W. M. Arno'd, a farmer on the Pater-
son River, who lost his life at flood-time in
endeavouring to save half-a-dozen pumpkins; the
fifth. Sir George Wigram Allen (dead), a wealthy
solicitor: the sixth, Edmund Barton, a barrister
in active practice ; and the seventh and present,
John Henry Young, a produce-agent, who, having
become insolvent, is now resigning. Sir Wigram
Allen occupied the chair for the most lengthened
period—Bo months.
Father Ahearne, a temperance reformer
on the Hunter River (N.S.W.), has just died.
The father never gave the pledge for life if he
could help it, 12 months being generally his limit.
Towards the end of that time he would wait upon
the “case” and say ; “ Well, Pat, ye’ve done well
this year. Ye’ve a tidy little bit by in the bank,
I’ll be bound—try the pledge for another year.”
And although Pat badly wanted a spree and was
looking forward to his release from the pledge to
indulge in one, he found himself again bound for
another year.
H. R. Nicholls, editor of the Hobart
Mercury, contributes an article on Imperial
Federation to the United Service Monthly for
September. Nicholls is an old “Eureka,” and
one of the half-dozen front-rank journalists of
Australasia. At the great dinner given to the
delegates attending the first Federal Convention,
he made what was admitted by all present the
speech of the occasion. Unhappily, not a syllable
was reported. The visiting reporters trusted to
the Mercury fellows for a “note,” but the ever-
modest Nicholls had ordered his men “ to drop
him.”
There is now living at Mortlake, (Vic.), a
gentleman nonagenarian, Mr. Rowe, who in Ids early
days was a page at the house of the poet Byron.
He was engaged by the poet soon after the latter’s
marriage, and remained with his wife some time
after the separation. Mr. Rowe, who is in full and
staunch possession of his faculties and has a sur-
prising memory, is a believer in Lady Byron, and
lays on her husband all the blame for the unfortu-
nate domestic relations of the pair. It gives one
quite an old-world feeling to talk to one of the
household of a man who had been dead some time
when Macaulay reviewed him sixty years ago.
POLITICAL
POINTS
London Times complains that the Aus-
tralian strike reduces Masters to mere Pay-
masters. Quite so.
The- West Sydney electoral roll contains
10,810 names —how many of them non-residential
or “allotment” men is not stated.
British cavalry is dragooning, in the name
of God, the villainous dissenting Welsh farmers
who refuse to pay their Anglican Church tithes.
Duncan Gillies and Co., alarmed and
shocked by the Premier Building Society ex-
posures, propose to create a Public Prosecutor for
Victoria.
A new office—that of Public Prosecutor,
at a salary of £lsoo—has been created in Mel-
bourne. No appointment will be made until Mr.
Wrixon returns from Europe.
Messrs. Dillon and O Brien are to be
arrested if they venture on Canadian soil during
their projected visit to America. What, we
wonder, should they visit Australia ?
The German Radikalen very strongly

Sitting on the Government benches in the
N.S.W. Assembly now is a member who assigned
his estate a few months ago. No action was taken
to have his seat vacated ; but, then, he supports
the Government.
S.A. Legislative Council has rejected the
provisions for rating municipal properties on the
unimproved value on two occasions, and the
Assembly has now sent it up a third time as a
real challenge of battle.
South Australia, notwithstanding her
vaunted democracy, is only just moving for free
education ! And the State education of N.S.W.
is neither free nor secular. To be justly compul-
sory, education must be both free and secular.
The apparently inevitable result of the
West Sydney contest will, let us hope, teach
Labour a lesson in fighting elections. It is as
well that the lesson is to be learned at a bye
instead of at a general election involving four
seats.
The present Queensland Assembly is com-
posed of 72 members, of whom 35 are Government
supporters and 36 Oppositionists ; that is to say,
the Government have not the power to out-vote
the Opposition, and the latter, on the other hand,
are not able to oust the Ministry.
That “ Honest Tom ” Playford is nearing
his political horizon is certain. His budget speech
was poor, his leadership of the present Ministry
is undecided and weak, and his old Conservative
ideas are now dragging him down. This threatens
to be “ Honest Tom’s ” last Ministry.
“ It would be the best day ever seen if we
returned to the moral condition of society—if we
took what obviously belongs to the whole and
made it the property of the whole, and gave the
full opportunity for man to produce according to
the gifts God has given him.”— Gilmour , the
Adelaide Socialist parson.
Watch for trouble in Holland. A doting
Monarch, of 73, will leave a young Queen-daughter
aged 11, a playmate for the bib-and-tucker King
of Spain. Germany meanwhile gathers up its
coils, being in want of the Dutch seaboard and the
rich Dutch colonies, especially Java, and the
chunks of Sumatra, Celebes, and Borneo.
With the death of the Dutch King, his
Duchy of Luxemburg will revert to the Duke of
Nassau, a German. The town of Luxemburg used
to be the strongest place in Europe, 34 miles north
of Metz, and quite apart from Holland, on the
Belgian frontier. The fortifications have long
been dismantled, on International Treaty, but
Germany will soon set about re-creating them.
Perhaps the most brilliant pens ever
enlisted by the Freetraders were those of the
Saturday Reviewers, and yet that organ of
refined Toryism could find nothing more applauda-
tory to say of the last annual gathering of the
Cobden Club than: “The Clubbites celebrated with
such joy of heart and hope as they could the cir-
cumstance that the whole world declined to follow
inCobden’s footsteps.”
Henry George says that Premier Parkes
“is a convert of ours and an earnest advocate of
the single-tax.” Mysterious old dog! So far as
Premier Parkes’ public utterances are concerned,
there is as much ground for asserting that he is a
convert of Brigham Young and the earnest advo-
cate of polygamy as that he is a Single-taxer.
When Henry George was in N.S.W., Parkes ap-
parently avoided him as if he were a leper.
Abigail, who was left out of office when
Parkes purified and gentlemanised his team, shows
his teeth and says he is prepared to maintain on
the ’ustings the necessity for revising the N.S.W.
tariff— at once. Erawncis, having tasted the
sweets of office is not satisfied to remain without
a portfolio. If he can’t get one at a reasonably
early date he will return to Hingland and bury
his sorrows awhile among the earls with whom he
is now solid.
It is currently reported that that in-
fatuated Tory Minister, Patterson, of Victoria,
called the attention of the Cabinet to Chief Jus-
tice Higinbotham’s conduct in donating £5O to 'the
Trades Hall Council, and requested that lie should
be formally and indignantly censured therefor. Tc
is also reported that Gillies at once pointed cut
the inadvisability of a worm seizing a lion by the
tail. The subject then dropped, amid general
consternation.
With the sentiments expressed by editor
Hoolan in the Queensland Assembly the other
night with respect to the lash, The Bulletin
thoroughly agrees. No man has a right to repre-
sent white men in Parliament who would not be
prepared, in the event of his being lashed in cold
blood for a deed he had done in hot blood, to
commit suicide. To any man with a spark of
sensitiveness in his nature, life after the lash
would be no longer worth living except for the
purposes of revenge.
France’s decline in population, threatens
soon to take the appalling form of there being
more deaths than births. A century ago France
had a population of 2(5,000,000, Russia bad only
25,000,000, Austria 17,000,000, Prussia 15,000,000,
and England 12,000,000. To-day Russia possesses
00,000,000 inhabitants, Germany 40 000,000,
Austria 38,000,000 and France 30,000,000. The
birth-rate is (>*7 per 1000 in Italy, 10 in Ger-
many, 12-9 in Russia, 13-7 in England, and
1-19 in France. The disparity of increase on the
part of France as contrasted with Russia and
Germany, is, of course, not wholly due to a loiler
birth-rate: her territory has shrunk, while theirs
has been greatly extended.
The latest big Thames Embankment hotel
will make up 1800 beds.
There are no less than live men now lying

Does Lady Robinson mean to help Sir
William in governing Western Australia, or is
she going to stay among the mountains of the far
East while the bald-headed William composes, in
the far West, songs addressed to the eyebrows of
his best girl?
The editor of a moral publication issued
in New Zealand allows his “Constant Reader”
to hold forth in half-a-column of print on the evils
of drink and cigars. Here is a sample :
Every young man entering upon life should pray for
strength to resist the carnal indulgences of drink and
tobacco. They are a clog upon the higher spiritual life,
the life of the soul, and every person who uses either of
them is in danger of taking the downward road. One
case occurs to me particularly—that of two friends whom
I once knew. 1 was able to persuade one of them to
abandon these evil indulgences, but the other refused to
give them up I lost sight of them afterwards, &c., &c.
There is a rather unfinished look about this story,
for the writer never found his two friends again,
and, therefore, we rise to offer him some further
information about one of them. He continued to
abstain from drink and tobacco, and saved up the
price of these worldly indulgences until he was
able to get married and be happy. If he had
wasted his substance on champagne and cigars it
is to say that he couldn’t have got mar-
ried. After a while his wife emptied some boiling
water over him and assaulted him with’ coals, and
when he defended himself with the tongs he was
arrested for violence and got fourteen days. By
the time he came out the lady had taken all the
money and his clothes and the furniture, and
eloped with a hard-drinking individual who smoked
a short clay pipe. Ho never saw her again, but he
remained steady in the faith, and was killed
through the overturning of a kerosene-lamp at a
teetotal meeting. We give these facts from per-
sonal knowledge, as we were the other fellow
alluded to in the above letter. We escaped the
conflagration, as we happened to be away smoking
and having a beer at the time the awful disaster
took place. Some time afterwards wo were in-
duced to reform our ways and become a Recha-
bite, but after two weeks of it we fell away and
were expelled. As the building fell in on top of
the society three days later, we did not regret the
circumstance, and wo have continued to liquor up
at reasonable intervals ever since. Our life haying
been twice saved by drink, we respectfully decline
to take any more risks.

At Redfern railway-station, Sydney, a
areepy sight was seen the other day. A politician
was returning to Sydney after some months’ ab-
sence, when, by way of greeting, another politician
whose leading characteristics are his bad grammar
and his bigotry, rushed up to him and kissed him
on the cheek. Ugh !

A sensation was caused some years ago by
the elopement from Sydney of a particularly hand-
some woman, wife of a professional man, with a
pallid-faced Soudan warrior with enormous feet.
Word has just reached Australia that he some
time ago deserted her and that she has since died—
probably out of joy at getting rid of him.

We would be glad to know if the dignity
of the empire would suffer to any great extent
supposing the Admiral should cease to fire a big
gun every morning during his stay in Sydney
Harbour, or, at least, if he should bombard in a
somewhat lower key. Every time the thunderous
old howitzer goes off the patients in the hospital
sit up in affright, and every now and then some
weak and nervous subject is blasted into eternity
by the shock, and then his surviving relatives
grow disloyal, and the invisible “bond” which
unites us to the mother country is damaged m
consequence. The “bond” never did amount to
much, and it can’t stand having a gun fired at it
regularly every morning.

CARNIVAL REGRETS.
Ouptime is at hand with its bookmaking clamour
And wearisome talk of “twenty to one,”
But the Cup of to-day is bereft of the glamour
Of those that are gone.
No more for the tip of the touter we hunger,
Nor lend willing ear to the man in the street
As of yore when the heart in our bosom was
younger
And faster its beat.
No visions delusive we see in our slumber
Of thoroughbreds sweeping o’er Flemington
sward ;
No spectral official hoists uncanny number
On phantasmal board.
Heigho ! for the days when our hopes’ disappoint-
ment
Dropped as a tear in a Cupfull of bliss,
Like a bruise to the child whose infallible ointment
Is one loving kiss.
Say, are we content to be older and sager,
And richer, and greater in inches around
Than when we believed in a “good double ” wager,
And “did in ” our pound ?
Would we not that the past were returning to-
morrow ?
Those foolish Cup dreams which we formerly
dreamt,
We think of them now with a soft sigh of sorrow,
And not with contempt.
They are envious eyes that, at Carnival seasons,
We turn to the Stand, or the Hill, or the Elat,
Where once we were glad, for the slightest of
reasons,
To throw up our hat.
But now we are portly, and pompous and proper,
And quiet and cool as a corpse in his shroud—
O ! why can’t we flourish our new grey bell-topper,
And bawl with the crowd ?
The spell of the Lawn, lackaday ! it is' broken ;
We love not the beauties who glide to and fro,
Their words are not sweet like the tender words
spoken
So long, long ago.
The reddest of cherries Madge wore, in a bunch, on
The smartest of hats fastened back from her
brow,
We were too much engaged to care twopence for
luncheon —
We care for it now.
Cuptime come again ! bringing troubles and
pleasures
In yearly proportions of twenty to one ;
We welcome it not, but our memory treasures
Those Cups that are gone.
The latest eulogy on that incipient
Governor, Jersey, states that “ Ho is courtly and
business-like, and possessed of a deep interest in
manufacturing pursuits.” This doesn’t seem to
amount to much. The draper’s assistant is
courtly, for example, and the invoice-clerk in
M'Millan’s warehouse is business-like ; in fact, he
has got to be business-like or he will be promptly
fired out. And as for the “interest m manu-
facturing pursuits,” the remark applies equally
well to the man who drives a loom, or the fellow
who repairs a sewing-machine. We are glad to
hear that Jersey possesses these valuable qualifi-
cations, but to make him a Governor with
thousands a year on the strength of them is about
as sensible as to appoint a man who habitually
opens oysters in a restaurant to take charge of
the bombardment of a city on account of his in-
timate acquaintance with shells.

Lady Hopetoun’s manner towards some
Melbourne sassiety women, who came with floral
offerings to see their Governess off by the Adelaide
express, was something more than chilly. The
Bulletin is very cross indeed with Lady Hope-
toun. Pictorially she is a nice young person
enough, and has a certain quiet air of being able
to say something rather funny behind her fan.
But her cruel treatment of the native nobility—
even admitting that several of them deserve to’ be
crushed with a steam-hammer—shows a want of
consideration for the fact that she was sent out to
tighten those “silken bonds.” The fairy seems to
have proved an awful failure in that respect, and
though one of her husband’s suite may, or may
not have been knocked into pulp by an infuriated
husband, we can’t see that such a casual insult to
the family pride affects the main point. •

Not a bad yarn comes from across the
Straits. _ Sir Robert Hamilton published through
McGlashin s, the well-known Dublin publishers,
some years ago, a manual of book keeping for
schools, and a “ friend of Government House”—
we would not for a moment imply he was in-
spired—sent a copy to a principal official in the
Education Department with a letter suggesting
T
NOT TO BE FOOLED.
DRILL SERGEANT: “YOU THERE WITH THE MOUSTACHE, WHY DON’T
YOU CARRY OUT MY ORDERS? WHY DON’T YOU SHOULDER
ARMS?”
VOLUNTEER: “I AIN’T A-GOIN’ TO BE FOOLED LIKE THAT. SOON AS
EVER I’D SHOULDER, YOU’D WANT ME TO PUT THE BLOOMIN’
RIFLE DOWN AGIN.”
that the book might be suitable for introduction
into the public schools. The official examined it,
and not identifying the author with His Excel-
lency, said that the work might do for Irish
schools, but they wanted a more intelligently
compiled manual for Colonial use !

The site of Adelaide Town Hall is the
block purchased for Matthew Davenport Hill,

The original manuscript of a diary kept in
V.D.L. and N.S.W. from 1835 to 1850 by a lady
—wife of an officer in the 50th Regiment (the
“Fighting Half Hundred”) —has come into the
possession of a Bulletin man. Landing at
Hobart Town from the Augusta Jessie, convict
transport, on the 114th day “out,” the writer of
the diary was delighted “to receive an invitation
from the pleasing wife of the Attorney-General to
a fancy ball,” and then flashes this side-light on an
historic character :
Our host was one of the most gentlemanly, clever men
I have ever had the pleasure of meeting, notwithstanding ”
(italics Tub Billktis’s) “his telling me that Providence
had intended him for an upholsterer, because he had so
much taste in furniture !”
And she calmly gives her gentlemanly clever host
away by identifying him as the Chief Justice of
New South Wales of a later year.

Nineteen men are now imprisoned in

That Bathurst man who, the other day,
got six months’ for making a bargain for another
man’s wife and marrying her, is not the first of his
class in the west. The Bulletin knows a very
prosperous, pious, and persevering man over the
mountains who bought his wife for a bottle of
“Old Tom,” and lived happily till death put in
its claim.

Mr. Justice Foster (N.S.W,), in summing
up the evidence in a case of bigamy at Bathurst
the other day, remarked that “ this case was
degrading to the country. ... It was such a
case that in England and other places the people
would stand aghast in horror .” Now, why should
Mr. Justice Foster talk such nonsense ? In
England “and other places” people are not half
so much addicted to being hysterical as are the
legal authorities of happy New South Wales,
which hangs for twenty-three offences as against
two made capital by the English code. Perhaps
one of these days, when England gets to know,
per medium of some travelling Froude or Dilke,
that you can be tied up and flayed at the
triangles under N.S.W. law for taking out your
lead pencil and absent-mindedly writing your
name on a public building, England will “ stand
aghast with horror.”

Judge Molesworth delivered sensible re-
marks at Melbourne Church Assembly, on Bishop-
importing, pointing out that in 16 years only 10
students of Trinity College, Melbourne, had gone
in for theology, and with an inference that these
were comparative nincompoops. Suppose the
Judges were imported from England, what sort of
a Bar should we have ? A Mr. Justice Goe and a
Chief Justice Saumarez Smith !

Seventy-four years ago an Australian-born
boy left N.S.W. for England with his father,
a non-commissioned officer in an English line-
regiment. On arriving at the age of 15, the boy
quarrelled with his father, returned to N.S.W.,
and was heard of no more by his relatives, nor did
he hear of them. Years went by, one of the
youth’s two sisters died, and the other came to
N.S.W. as a governess, in the hope, she said, of
finding her only relative, but though she made
during a residence of 50 years all the search prac-
ticable, she never once found trace of her long-lost
brother. Yet, despite all her failures, she ceased
not to make enquiries concerning anyone bearing a
name in the least like that of her family. A few
weeks ago at , in a N.S.W Western town,
the long-estranged brother and sister met, he a
bent man of 76, she but a few years younger. He
did not even know her name, he mistook her for
the sister who had died.
And then they, the brother and sister whose
companionship was of the morning and the even-
ing only, walked hand in hand to the bottom of
the hill at the setting of the sun Not
so. They quarrelled bitterly and parted for
ever within a few hours, for had not he allowed
his dead wife to bring up her daughters in a
religion alien to that professed by her sister !

The robberies perpetrated on respectable
married men by the nymphs of a certain Mel-
bourne bagnio are a scandal to the morality of
that city. It is right enough that erring bachelors
should be compelled to leave all their portable
property (except the clothes they get drunk in)
upon the altar of Venus, but the married inno-
cents must really be let off cheaply for the sake of
their wives and children. And the law must
provide for a special reduction in the case of a
K.C.M.G., or other representative person. Such
as Sir , but no matter.

A memorable ass writes in a British
magazine that Australian loyalty is likely to fade
md -ss a prince comes round occasionally to freshen
the old sentiment up. Unluckily a prince is
gen 'rally the chief cause of disloyalty, at least wo
never heard of any active disloyalty except when
there was a prince about. To be disloyal—in the
ordinary acceptation of the term—without one is
like trying to get up an insurrection in an unin-
habited country. Moreover, even assuming that
the presence of a monarch rr her relatives is rn
I noentive to loyalty, it is worth noting that there
are between forty and a hundred such individuals
in the United Kingdom, and the population has
started to hiss when it sees them ; therefore, if all
this gathering cannot keeps things level in two
small islands, what influence can possibly be exer-
cised on a whole continent by a mere fleeting
glimpse of the meanest and least dignified of the
whole Imperial crowd ? If a hungry horse could
be fed upon the photograph of one solitary oat
the scheme might work—otherwise it has got to
collapse,

The Rev. Stacy Chapman, D.D., who is
now before the public with an anti-strike
pamphlet, happens to be one of the league that
announced some weeks ago that they would not
perform the marriage ceremony for people once
divorced under the present Victorian Divorce Act.
Bnt, then, Dr. Chapman probably considers that
he is not in this connection “on strike,” and an
agent of “ social oppression ” abominable in
intention and morally illegal, also a breaker of
the laws of the land.

When William Henry Leighton Bailey
assured a Melbourne Judge the other day that he
had not run away from .Sydney with the funds of
the defunct Australian Prudential Insurance Co.
he asserted the simple truth. The charge- never
yet answered—against the directors of that
society was that they never had any funds worth
speaking of. The concern was the funniest of the
many funny things floated as companies in
Sydney. Its original capital was £5OO borrowed
on the life-policy of the secretary.

It is gratifying to learn that the Premier
Building Society defendants will not be required
to occupy the dock at their trial, like any
ordinary, degraded individual who is suspected of
prigging a handkerchief or two boots. Also they
will not be searched. Any plain, common,
humble defendant, when he surrenders to his
bail, is taken downstairs and inspected lest he
should have come provided with firearms or some-
thing, and should open fire on the court when lie
is convicted; but the policeman who looked for
hidden weapons on ten eminent citizens, all well
provided with cash, would probably be struck by
lightning for conspicuous impiety towards the
upper classes.

Mrs. Bourke, of Sydney, has been tried
and acquitted on one of those charges of child-

politely termed baby-farming. Without reference
to the correctness of the verdict in Mrs. Bourke’s

these acquittals will follow one after the other so
long as the death-penalty hangs to the offence and
the recommendations of juries are persistently

What the Church doesn’t know about
assimilating the £ s. d. is too small to be worth
mentioning. At a holy bazaar recently held out
West, a small room was curtained off from the
hall, and male Christians were admitted at a
charge of 3d. Inside, twelve of the prettiest girls
in the town could be kissed for a shilling apiece,
or a hungry client could kiss the whole lot for
half-a-sovereign. If he insisted on hugging the
patient it was two-and-six. Most of the visitors
took the whole ten shillingsworth, and that night
the entire town could hardly have raised the price
of a pint of beer. If a conflagration with a pesti-
lence behind it had raged through the district,
the population couldn’t have been more utterly
cleaned out. The success of this experiment leads
us to make a suggestion. Why not let the prettiest
girls in the church take turns at passing the plate,
and let them hug each worshipper who subscribes,
say, half-a-crown or upwards. As a financial
device this would knock the plain, unvarnished
gospel into a cocked hat, and many a low, coarse
scoffer who now holds aloof would be gathered in,
and would listen to the voice of Terewth.

and she was carefully alluded to as “ the woman ”

At Melbourne District Court last week,
one John Mitchell was fined sixty shillings “for
being wilfully guilty of not allowing another
person, when practicable, to pass on the right or
off side.” The other person was the Governor,
and Mitchell’s offence consisted in not immedi-
ately clearing his buggy off the vice-regal track at
the bidding of a mounted lacquey. Seeing that
the evidence of felonious intent was purely sup-
posititious, inasmuch as Mitchell’s turning to one
aide, instead of to the other side, only “seemed
wilfully done in order to obstruct,” the penalty
inflicted by Magistrate Panton can only be justi-
fied by that unwritten law of “loyalty” under
which no Melbourne citizen can breathe freely
when his Excellency is nigh. It was more than
sufficient anyway without the gratuitous insult of
a speech from the ultra “loyal” beak, who told
defendant that, although he is an American sub-
ject, “his own good sense ought to tell him to
make way for the Governor.” What made
Panton an authority on good sense ? The Beer-
thirst incident, we presume.

622 women of Teralba, Minmi and Greta

basis of the hatred felt by the average woman for
barmaids is plain enough. It is against custom
for a woman to enter bars and take her drinks
like a man, hence a bar is to the fair sex a mys-
terious place. So lovely woman determines to
destroy that in regard to which she cannot gratify

An ejectment case at Bathurst last week

father of the plaintiff was a soldier on board.

young man who didn’t feel well in that forgotten

he is alive does he feel well to-day, or does he still
experience the physical troubles which induced
him to send along his guinea, together with a
stamped and addressed envelope, to the late resi-
dence of his Excellency the Governor, in the
giddy times when the country was still young
and addicted to wickedness, in consequence of
which it suffered from “symptoms akin to the

Editor Bulletin.— -Sir, —ln a recent issue
of The Bulletin I notice a paragraph stating
that a Victorian named Keeble, who has just
settled on the Manning River, N.S.W., istheman
who made the golden horseshoes and nailed them
on Mr. Cameron’s horse in Beechworth in 1855.
As a resident of the Beechworth district from
1853, who has read and heard many fables about
the golden shoes, I will, with your permission,
give a correct account of the affair, which can be
corroborated by many of the old miners of the
once famous Woolshed Creek : —ln October, 1853,
while I was boarding at Mrs. Clarke’s Franklin
Hotel, on the Upper Woolshed, seven miles
from Beechworth, a man named Brown
(long i-ince dead, but at that time or soon after-
wards owner of the Rook Station, near Wagga
Wagga) came there with his circus, and
as there were about 17,000 men on the creek,
earning, say, £7 a week a-piece, he did a big busi-
ness. To make his circus a greater attraction, he
bought some gold and got Tommy Toofield, a
goldsmith, working as a smelter at the time, to
make four horseshoes (or rather, slippers) weigh-
ing about soz. each. Brown had a black mare,
and during the evening’s performance the shoes
were tacked on, she was led around the ring, her
feet lifted up, and the shoes shown to the audience.
The mare was then led away and the shoes taken
off. I have seen it stated that Cameron rode from
the Woolshed to Beechworth on his horse shod
with gold; but anyone who knows that rugged,
granite, mountainous road could easily imagine
how much would be left of the shoes by the time
he had ridden half-way. I worked in Keeble’s
claim for some time. His partners were—Wren,
Oheeseman, and Frank Nichols (the latter is at
Parkes now), I should like, for the sake of the
working man, to see such times again. Money
was plentiful; for instance, the qualification for a
member of Parliament then was £2OOO or a certain
income. When Cameron was proposed as a mem-
ber, although his claim was yielding him £l5O a
week, a few of the bosses met at Mrs. Clarke’s
and put down £l7OO. In the afternoon they went
down the creek and collected the remaining £3OO.
—Yours. S. T. Bishop, Gulgong.
Two thousand three hundred and twenty-
two small Victorian boys were camped out at
Langwarrin last week, and put through a course
of military tomfoolery suited to their tender
years. Only the bespangled swaggerers in charge
of these baby battalions, and the weak-minded
parents who contribute offspring to the Cadet
cause, can contemplate their annual gathering
without a groan. At a hasty glance the toy
camp, strewn with orange-peel, lemonade-bottles
and sandwich-bags, seems a joyous joke, yet very
little reflection is necessary to convince the
thoughtful observer that moral poison lurks in
each pound of cake served out to ‘ ‘ our young
defenders.” Of all the juvenile instincts, the
military instinct is one that should be repressed
rather than nourished on buns and sticky liquors.
The bump of destruction is lamentably prominent
on the heads of most boys, and their natural
tendency to pelt stones at the passer-by,
especially when he happens to be a China-
man, is deplored by society at large and
the victims in particular. Almost the first
duty of parents and guardians is to convince the
rising generation that there are grander objects in
life than the indulgence of an inherent craving
for destruction and the exercise of armed force.
Tommy is forbidden to arm himself with a stick
because a boy so armed is unable to resist the
desire of assaulting the nearest defenceless civilian
boy upon his shin. If Tommy be not checked in
the days of childhood he becomes, just according
to circumstances, a dangerous larrikin or a bell-
toppered representative bully, who believes in
putting things down with a firm hand, sir. The
immediate object of giving boys a cadet training
is to stimulate their natural passion for assault and
battery, whilst subjecting it to a system of
physical discipline, -which is accepted as highly
beneficial by people who associate a course
of drilling—“military' drill” being the
popular term with uniforms, sham fights
and professional swagger, just as though
boys couldn’t be taught to walk pro-
perly, or turn right wheel with neatness or
despatch, unless they are first figged out in
miniature trappings of war. The wearing of a
uniform, the swilling of lemonade “ under
canvas,” and the turning out to muster at bugle
call are by no means necessary to a boy’s educa-
tion in obedience or manly deportment. The
worst use to which we can put a boy is to make a
sucking soldier of him —to hand him over to the
temporary care of a full-sized fool of a colonel,
who thinks that teaching the young idea to shoot
involves the assistance of fire-arms. The mis-
guided kid naturally is brought to regard mili-
tarism as something to be admired for itself
alone. In after life his heart warms at the sound
of a kettle-drum, and he can’t hear two bars of
the “ Minstrel Boy” without wanting to cry
“ Havoc !” and let loose the dogs of war on some
person or persons unknown. Surely tlie chubby-
cheeked Australian cadet is a sad thing in the
the sight of God at any time, and twas no
wonder that the spectacle of some twenty-three
hundred being drawn up in battle array at
Langwarrin caused the Heavens to weep copiously
upon their silly little heads.

When Sir Charles Dilke, in his “ Problems

Badham, of Sydney University, as a classicist
“with a local reputation,” lie was simply giving

and text-editor, had a European reputation ; and
if all the professorial reputations imported into
Australia before or since the Doctor’s time—and
we don’t forget Woolley, Wilson, or Hearn-were
placed one on top of another, they wouldn’t reach

Where do they goto? What is the secret of
their astounding success ? Questions easily
answered. They go into every civilised land on
the earth’s surface, and they are to be found in
the pockets of every people who wear clothes.
The more there are made, the more there are
wanted, and the only real difficulty in connection
with them is to keep up the supply. They have
an infinite variety of recommendations, but the
main one is th ir wonderfully accurate perform-
ances as timekeepers. The invention of the
Waterbury doomed expensive watches to gradual
extinction, for the Waterbury is exact and trust-
worthy.

Cup Cay at Caulfield was a great financial
success for "the V. A.T.C. and as ruinous as usual for the
miutirs, who seem never to weary of watering this book
makers’ paradise with their tears. The big meeting
whereat many of the races bring out good horses with a
fair percentage of “triers” amongst them—is generally
more disastrous to backers than the off days at Caulfield,
when about five of every six steeds are so defunct that
they can be smelt from afar by all save the innocents who
have no noses for such scandals. Still the attendance of
victims increases steadily, it not rapidly, every year, and
this time the number of sanguine individuals who cherish
hopes of working off the dead horse at Flemington is
absolutely appalling. The improbability of anyone
spotting a Caulfield Cup winner on its previous “form”
lias been more than once referred to in Tiik, Bulletin.
The length of the race and the nature of the course are
such that a dozen animals which have a poor chance of
being “in it” for the Melbourne Cup are not “out
of it” here. And although the race is a favourite
with the clever people, and “patient divisions,”
and notwithstanding that a “ bottled-up ” one generally
wins,” there is no getting away from the fact that Caul-
held heroes seldom do anything heroic after their one day
out Vengeance was a “good thing” (for the Ballarat
people who backed it) on Saturday, hut not sufficiently
[mod to carry a stone penalty home at Flemington, we
fancy. Nor is the half-head-beaten Loyalstone, for both
horses appeared to be tiring and coming hack to the
others as they struggled past the post. Next week, how-
ever, will be time enough to try for the winner of the
Melbourne Cup.
# * #
The o’d yarn about the “Ring” being hit
heavily will doubtless be told of this year’s Caulfield Cup.
It can’t be warranted to wash, all the same. When
Vengeance’s number went up there were, perhaps, a
couple of hundred people who cheered, and about ten
thousand who remarked “ dam,” in a dull, dissatisfied
kind of way. Many others had hoped to see Loyalstone’s
(idiotic name!) number hoisted, and they laid a heavy
accent on the D accordingly.
#* • *
Chintz was not let loose for last Saturday’s race,
after all, but will—all going well—prove an eleventh bom-
sensation in the Melbourne Cup betting. In her stead
the mysterious Jas. Wilson people ran The Serf, who never
gave them a ghost of a show to win their money, and
whose defeat was a negative source of satisfaction to the
racing world at large. The stable “accepted ” with three
horses, Swing being scratched on the morning of the race,
and Chintz’s number remaining amongst those of the in-
tended starters until a short time before the saddling-
hell rang. Presuming that the mare never left her train-
ing quarters at Queenscliff, it should be within the power
of "the stewards to demand an explanation of this delay in
scratching. Not that such little matters are very strictly
looked after at Caulfield. Only 20 minutes previous to
starting time for the last race several scratehings » c,, e
registered on the paddock black-board.
# * #
The placed horses in the Caulfield Cup have
ever shown themselves to have a good say for the Mel-
bourne Cup, taking, for instance, Sheet Anchor, Dunlop,
Silverraine, Grace Darling and Bravo.

The result of the recent drawn G oddard-Jackson
light at Melbourne, in which Goddard gave “ as ; o d as
he got” and a good deal better, in an eight-round
fight, must decidedly send the former’s stock up, as it
will undoubtedly send Jackson’s stock down. If the so-
called Broken Hill smasher (whose connection with the
Barrier is slight) can, in an eight - round match,
make a draw with one of the cleverest big men who ever-
entered the ring, he must, with his undoubted pluck and
hitting power, be equal to anything on the list in a fight
to a finish. Should things go on like this, Slavin may
soon have something else to do besides abusing Sullivan
The Bulletin has always believed in Slavin’s ability to
thump Jackson in a square fight, and now it is beginning
to believe that there are two men, at least, with whom
Jackson could not hold his own in a raw-meat and-grass
contest under London prize-ring rules—a contest under
which is, after all, the only true criterion of a man’s
ability as a real fighter. “Goddard had all the best of
it,” said one wire from a well-known sporting man—“ and
would certainly have got stakes by huge majority had
verdict been left to crowd.” It must not he forgotten that
the darkey was too cocksure to train properly, and that
the small ring was a point in favour of Goddard, the
rusher, against Jackson, the scientific fighter who likes to
fight at arm’s length.
#. # #
Peter Jackson, before going over to meet
Goddard, was made a Mason at Balmain The goat
must have disagreed with him.

The boxing-benefit for the strike-fund, at Sydney
Gaiety Theatre, on Saturday night last, is said to have
realised £5O. Many good boxers, including Griffo,
Dooley, Maher and Ryan, showed, and Larry Foley, who
officiated, received a tremendous ovation when Ire replied
to the thanks publicly tendered him by the representa-
tives of the strike-fund committee, and offered the use
of his theatre on some subsequent occasion. Larry, how-
ever, was dumb concerning the invitation to come out for
West Sydney tendered him. Should In- ever get in Parlia-
ment, it’s long odds he’d never be asked to come outside.

Hackford, the only man to finish, won the
Launceston seventy-two hours’ go-as-you-please with
a seore of 373 miles 14 laps—eight miles further than
Raynor's, the previous best Australian record. Raynor
has challenged him to walk six days and nights for £lOO.
# # #
Paddy Mor.au, said to be (Foley says no) the
“ unknown ” matched against Griffo, met Jack Hall, about
the smartest lightweight Sydney has seen, in the cellar of
Foley’s White Horse Hotel'. Moran stood before Hall for
fourteen rounds, when Hall knocked him down with the
right, and the noise when Moran’s head met the concrete
floor might have been heard in Pitt-street. Moran
graduated in the same school as Billy M'Carthy, Steve
O'Donnell, and other good men.

Jack Conway is back in Melbourne, where in
one year he was captain of the boss cricket eleven, South
Melbourne, and captain of the boss football team, Carlton.
Then he got cheered as a cricketer on the ground where
he got hooted as a footballer, and vice versa.
# * *
Sydney sports say that Megaphone's defeat is
due to the fact that he has not had half enough work
since going into Higinhotham’s hands. He is a glutton
for work. Others say he can’t run equally well on right-
handed and left-handed courses.

A London paper thus sums up Joe M'Auliffe :
. M'Aiiljffc appears to ho an over-grown ruffian who is 100
11 ( e to work, and therefore lives on gate-money. Persons
wishing to share the spoil with him induced him to stand
up before Slavin, who is admitted to be an athlete with
wonderful powti and skill in the use of his hands.
Nothing "cod could come of asking Slavin to chase this
fat man round a ring. The poor fellow may have been
anxious only to earn a living, but those who put him up
must have known of the sham.” Which is yet another
proof that the fallen pugilist has no friends.

R. Davis became the champion bicyclist of Aus-
tralia by securing the 10-mile race in Adelaide the other
day. Davis is a thin, weak-framed-looking athlete, and is
about the last person one would choose for a champion-

ment, and has secured the’ “Austral” championships
three times.

John L. Sullivan is said to be a stupendous

A British fashion paper recommends its readers
to learn the art of self-defence, on the ground that
“ boxing refines and polishes a women.” Which means,
w'e presume, that noble thoughts and lofty aspirations are
aroused in her gentle soul when she has been plugged in
the wind, and bashed on the listener, and landed heavily
on the conk, and also that it expands her mental horizon
to be severely fibbed and heavily grassed, and then to get
up and have her eye split, and to get a tremendous lift on
the jaw. All these things help to elevate the feminine
intellect, particularly when they are followed up by a
smash on the kisser.

Phillips, the Melbourne bowler, who has just
returned from his annual engagement at “ Home,” gives
a fair account of the Australian Eleven. He says that
none of them looked too fondly on the beer when it w'as
brown, and that their apparent failure was attributable
to the strength of the opposing teams. Apropos to which
it is noticeable that London papers excuse the indifferent
“county” record of t v, c Nottingham eleven by saying
that the best men were overworked in outside matches
against the Australians, played for the M.C.C. and other
people.

Titan, the £4OOO gelding, whose fresh and artless

The departed Curtis Reid, a veteran and en-
thusiastic cricketer, reported a match for one of the
Melbourne papers, and his running fire of exclamations
kept all within car-shot delighted. Yet his report was as
dry as a bone. The reporter sitting next him did net
know a thing about technical cricket, but coolly embodied
in his report all Curtis’ remarks. The result was me t

Walter Higinbotham does not appear to know
the constitution of either Titan or Megaphone. Titan
may have left his form behind him at two years, but
Megaphone could scarcely have fallen away in speed to

Captain Merry “dished up” a sensational three-
column yarn for the ’Frisco Breeder and Sportsman* out
of Sir Modred’s historical scratching, whereby Bank-
Manager Holt came to grief. He tells of Holt’s unholy
Friday’s breakfast, and finishes up by saying that Holt is
now confidential adviser on colonial affairs to the head
office of—well, a certain big bank.

Last Saturday a punter in a small way put his
little half-sov. on Singapore in a “ tote” for the Caulfield
Cup, and then wandered round Sydney nervously await-
ing news of the result. To pass away the time he had a
game of billiards with a friend, and then the pair went to
a cookshop for a snack. They were seated near the
speaking-tube connecting with the kitchen when a waiter
nearly broke the ear of the punter with the shout of
“ Sausages, one!” “Just my luck,” said the disgusted
punter, “ I didn’t even know there was such a horse in
the race.”

Cricket is fast becoming a thing of the past in
Sydney, and the cause does not take much looking for.
It lies in the so-called juniors being represented by bald-
headed, well-on-to-forty men, who have proved failures
in senior cricket and have drifted back to the ranks of
the juniors. Take, for instance, some of the men picked
to play in the coming Junior Intercolonial match against
Victoria, say, Camphin, Ellis, Kayser, Luland and others.
These men have tried senior cricket, failed, and now they
block the way of promising bona-fide juniors, who might,
if they got the show, develope into something good
enough to recruit the ranks of our seniors. It would
really be a benefit to the cricketing public —mind you,
we don’t say the general—if someone would go roui d
with an axe and knock these everlasting juveniles on the
head.

It appears to be certain death for an athlete to
contract typhoid fever, and the stronger and more power-
fully-built the man, the quicker the end comes. Poor T.
K. Bond,' the pedestrian, who died at Little Bay Hospital,
is the last athletic victim. 11. M. Johnson, the most
wonderful sprinter America ever produced, recently died
from typhodial peritonitis. Johnson, once editor of the
Sr. Lons slnws, and winner of a Sheffield handicap, is said
to have run 100 yards in 9j secs., but his record is given
as 0 4-sth secs.

In the match at Scarborough between Lord
Londcsborough’s Eleven and the Australians (which Aus-
tralia won by eight runs), Briggs, the Lancashire profes-
sional, achieved a remarkable performance in the first
innings, actually securing every one of the Australian
wickets, nine from his bowling, and the tenth thrown out.

Rowing on board the Sobraon, lying in Ply-

got lost and is said to have contracted a severe cold

caught by the unhappy Sammy.

blocks station, where ho used to practise with half-a-dozen
balls at a single stump, a trained sheep-dog doing the

THE BULLETIN (Published at Sydney, N.S.W)
The Unique Weekly, Australia’s Nonpareil
Illustrated Newspaper.
The Bulletin, the Premier Australian Literary
Journal, is the only paper which has a con-
sistent and distinctive Australian National
Policy.
The Bulletin favours—
A Republican Form of Government.
Payment of Members.
One Man, one Vote.
State Revenue derived directly from the Land.
Complete Secularisation of State Education.
Reform of the Criminal Code and Prison
System,
A United Australia and Protection against
the World.
The Bulletin denounces —
Religious Interference in Politics.
Foreign Titles.
The Chinese.
Imperial Federation.
The public eye rejects as uninteresting more
than half of what appears in the newspapers of
the day. It is only the other half that is found
in The Bulletin.
The Bulletin is an aggressive Democratic
paper which strives to exclude from its artisti-
cally-condensed columns all matter which is not
of general human interest. The Bulletin was
started seven years ago with no capital but brains,
and has become a vast property, because it pos-
sessed a vitality lacked by the countless news-
paper-ventures in which Australian capitalists
have unavailingly spent large fortunes.
The Bulletin’s conductors claim that every
progressive paper on the Australian continent has
more or less endeavoured to profit by its example
and follow its lines. The result of its powerful
influence and its unprecedented literary and com-
mercial success can at once be seen by comparing
the methods pursued by the Australian daily and
weekly press prior to and immediately after the
first issue of The Bulletin.
From the date of The Bulletin’s inaugural
publication its success was assured. It had at
once a dozen more or less servile imitators, many
of which even took, so far as was possible, its
name. They are now all dead, while The Bul
letin continues the one phenomenal success in
Australian journalism, the one completely non-
local and distinctly universal Australasian news-
paper.
The Bulletin proprietary have, during the
last year, spent some thousands of pounds in
fitting their buildings with the latest appliances
for high-class printing and the production of illus-
trations, and they have now issued The Bulletin
in an entirely new form—printed with new type
of improved legibility on the finest paper, and
adorned with sketches from the 'hands of the
ablest and best-paid newspaper artists Australia
has ever seen.
The Bulletin is the only well-established Aus
tralian journal which, throughout its career, has
been consistently Radical. It points with pride
to the fact that for years it stood alone among
secular newspapers in advocating the Irish
National Cause, and that it was the only Aus-
tralian journal which denounced the Soudan
Expedition from its inception.
The voice of The Bulletin is the beacon-fire
of national progress: it is the forceful summons to
the crusade against the monopolies in land,
wealth, power, and privilege—the direct cause of
half the misery which now afflicts British
humanity. Against the claims of avaricious
clergy who claim to monopolise salvation, against
the dark despotism of grasping plutocrats, and
against the exercise of any human authority
which has not been granted by the people over
whom it is exercised, The Bulletin will fearlessly
and ruthlessly contend.
The Bulletin, unlike the ordinary w r eekly
journal, is not loaded with a weight of matter
transferred from the columns of a daily paper
issued from the same office. The Bulletin is
not connected with any other paper, and the
matter it contains is all specially prepared by its
own unequalled staff.
The Bulletin, which is the only paper sold
by runners in the streets of every Australasian
capital, is the most widely-circulated of all papers
published south of the equator, and is the only
Australasian publication which enjoys a popu-
larity unhampered by the political boundaries
that so closely restrict other journals to the
colonies in which they are printed.
The Bulletin’s red cover is equally familiar
to the bushman of the Far North, the stockman
of Central Australia, the pcarl-sheller of Torres
Straits, and the digger in tho New Zealand
Ranges. A paper which is at once the
most popular city publication and the organ of tho
ntelligent bushman must indeed be broadly based.
The circulation of The Bulletin in Sydney is
unrivalled by that of any other weekly journal,
and more than a hundred copies of it are sold in
Melbourne to one of any other paper printed out-
side that city. Perhaps the strongest proof of The
Bulletin’s popularity is found in the unchallenge-
able fact —easily ascertainable from any postal
official —that, of all journals issued in Australasia,
The Bulletin is the one most frequently re-
mailed from one reader to another.
The Bulletin is the journal which, of all Aus-
tralian journals, is most frequently quoted in Eng-
land, America, and the colonies.
The Bulletin is going ahead faster than any
other paper, because its vast mass of original and
specially-written reading matter is the brightest
and best, its illustrations the cleverest and most
artistic, and its policy the boldest and most
straightforward ever submitted to the Australian
public.

AYER’S HAIR VIGOR is unrivaled for
the restoration of faded and gray hair to its
original color and freshness, and for keeping
the scalp clean and healthy. The most popular
and elegant toilet preparation in the world, all
who use it, pronounce it, also, the best hair-
grower. When the capillary glands become en-
feebled by disease, age, or neglect, this dressing
imparts renewed life to the scalp, so that the
hair again assumes its original
Fullness and Beauty.
Ladies find that this preparation imparts to the
hair a silken pliancy and a delicate and lasting
fragrance. Gentlemen use it to prevent bald-
ness, to restore faded and gray hair to its former
color and abundance, and to relieve the scalp of
troublesome humors and dandruff. A proof of
the superiority of this preparation over all
others of the kind is the constantly-increasing
demand for it in all civilized countries.

“The Conventional Lies
of our Civilisation.”
THE ECONOMIC LIE.— CHAPTER IV.
BY MAX NORDAU.
r X I HK sentiment in regard to the unendurable con-
ditions of affairs in the economic world is
universal. The wretched operative whoso daily
hunger keeps the subject always in his mind
knows that he produces wealth by the labour of
jus hands, when he is demanding his share of the
riches he thus creates. But he commits the
mistake of founding his demand upon all sorts of
reasons that do not stand the test of criticism.
There is only one single true and natural argument
which he can call to his aid, and that is un-
answerable : the argument that he has the power
to take possession of the goods which he produces,
that the rich are in the minority and unable to
prevent this appropriation, consequently, that he
has the right to keep what he makes, and to help
himself to what he needs. The whole of the
present structure of society is built upon this
argument as its sole foundation. This argument
makes the weaker individuals and peoples slaves
of the stronger; it makes millionaires out of
shrewd and unscrupulous men, and sets up Capital
as the absolute master of the whole world. The
minority —the loafers and plunderers—make con-
stant use of this argument to silence the demands
of the labouring and plundered classes. But
the wages-receiver, whose mind, in spite of
all its Radicalism, is still entangled in the
meshes of the ideas of right and mora-
lity, inculcated by Capital, hesitates to em-
ploy this unanswerable argument, based upon
the laws and instincts of nature. He prefers
to seek the justifiableness of his claims in
all kinds of out of the way excuses and ideas,
among which Communism is the most widely
accepted and believed. Thus, in the most foolish
manner, he enters upon territory in which he is
sure to be defeated.
* * *
Capital has no difficulty at all in proving the
absurdity of this theory. In fact, Communism,
as all socialistic schools comprehend and preach
it, is the outgrowth of a preposterous chimera,
evolved from the inflamed imagination of certain
dreamers, deaf and blind to the realities of the
world and human nature. Actual community in
property, or the negation of individual rights in
property, has never existed since the world began.
That condition of property-holding which a super-
ficial observer might consider to be Communism,
and of which several examples have occurred in
historic times, some even existing in a few isolated
places at the present day, is founded upon the
basis of individual ownership of property, separate
from the mass of property existing in the world at
large. When such a perfect cohesion and sense of
fellowship exists among a small number of indi-
viduals owing to their common descent or other
causes, that a family, a village, or a whole tribe
considers itself as one single being of a higher
order of creation, then it is conceivable that this
collective individual should possess an indivisible
collective amount of property, which the single
individual could not control and use for his own
advantage and to the prejudice of others. This
kind of collective property holding, which exists
in several places in Europe at the present time,
such as the Russian Mir and the united households
of the Croatians and the Slavonians, has nothing
in common with Communism, that is, fundamen-
tal and universal community in property through-
out the world, as can easily be demonstrated. J ust
let an outsider, an individual not accepted as a
member of the circle of joint owners of the com-
mon property, let him attempt to get possession
of the smallest fragment of it! The entire tribe,
village, Mir, &c., will rise up in arms at once to
repel the intruder. The joint possessors of the
common capital are imbued so strongly with the
sense of proprietorship in it, that they rebel
against any appropriation of any part of it by out-
siders, with as much liveliness of indignation as
an individual proprietor would experience if an
attack were made upon his purse. And even this
collective proprietorship, which is by no means
actual Communism, but only a more primitive
form of personal ownership of property, can only
exist so long as every member of the community
experiences directly and profoundly his cohesion
and fellowship to and with the rest. Its perpetua-
tion depends also upon the similarity of the
labour performed by the members, so that the
efforts made by each can be compared easily and
directly with those of the rest, and no doubts
arise as to their relative value or importance. As
soon as a division of labour takes place and differ-
ent kinds of production are carried on in the
collective community, the necessity will arise
to compare, the relative values of certain
kinds of labour, each useful in its way, but
differing completely in every other respect, it will
be impossible to estimate justly and satisfactorily
to each member the utility and pecuniary value of
his labour, as it differs in kind from that of those
around him, consequently the collective proprietor-
ship in the results of the efforts of all must neces-
sarily come to an end, and the ownership of pro-
perty individualise itself in a very short time.
Thus we see that the solution of the economic pro-
blem is not to be looked for in Communism. It
is a natural condition possible only in very low
forms of collective associations and could not exist
in a form of animal life so highly developed as in
our human society. Individual possession is the
natural condition not only of men, but of most
animals. The source of the impulse for individual
proprietorship is the necessity for the gratification
pf individual wants. Every animal must supply
itself with nourishment and many require also an
artificially-prepared shelter or natural hiding-place.
Ihe food and the nest or den which it has found or
made for itself, is considered by the animal as its
property. It feels that these things belong to it,
and to no other being, and will not submit with-
out resistance to being deprived of them by any
other individual. A life that makes foresight and
provision for the future a necessity leads to the
extension of this sentiment of proprietorship and
to the development of the impulse for acquiring
increased individual possessions. A beast of
prey, which lives upon fresh meat, fixes the limits
°f bis proprietorship in the total amount of fresh
meat existing, at the quantity which he requires
•or one single meal. But an animal which lives
upon a vegetable diet, if his home is in a region
where there is a winter with a cessation of vegeta-
tion, helps himself from the common store-house
of nature to far more than is necessary to supply
his immediate wants. He accumulates more food
than he can possibly require during the coming
months, thus decreasing without any organic
necessity the amount of food at the disposal of
other animals, he becomes a capitalist and an un-
scrupulous egotist. In this way squirrels, field-
mice, marmots, &c., heap up quantities of nuts
and fruits of all kinds in their holes to provide
for the coming winter, which is not all consumed
at the return of spring, when they can find food
again in the fields and forests. They not only
realise the possibility of their personal proprietor-
ship but they accumulate wealth, they become
rich, in the sense of owning more than they re-
quire for their actual wants. Man belongs to the
category of animals to whom provision for the
future is necessary. The acquisition of individual
property, to increase it beyond what is actually
required for the moment, to defend it against the
encroachments of others, these are natural vital
actions and instincts in him to which he is im-
pelled by the fundamental impulse of self-preser-
vation, and which are impossible to eradicate.
Even under the most violent compulsion of laws
framed in opposition to them, they would assert
themselves again and again with their elementary
strength.
* * *
But if individual proprietorship be a natural
instinct, and hence utterly refuses to be sup-
pressed, there is one application of the right of
personal possession against which reason abso-
lutely revolts, and for whose existence no natural
causes can be produced—this is inheritance.
It is true that the impulse for the pre-
servation of the species impels all living
beings to care for their offspring and to
provide the most favourable conditions of exis-
tence possible for them. But this care never
extends beyond the moment when the young crea-
tures are sufficiently developed to care for them-
selves without outside assistance, as the parents
did before them. There is only sufficient stored-
up food in the seed of the plant or in the white of
the egg, to supply the embryo with nourishment
during its earliest stage of life—the time of abso-
lute helplessness. The mammiferous animals
give milk to their young only as long as they are
unable to graze or hunt food for themselves, and
the parent birds cease to bring worms to their
little ones as soon as they have successfully ac-
complished their first independent flight.
# # #
Man alone wishes to provide his descendants
with their stored-up food, their albumen, their
milk and their worms, to the third and fourth, to
untold generations. Man alone is anxious to keep
his children and great grand-children, into the
most distant future, in the embryonic condition
in which the young of all animals are provided for
by the beings to whom they owe their existence;
he will not abandon them to their own re-
sources. Wfcen a man accumulates a fortune, he
wishes to bequeath it to his family in such a way
that its members will be, if possible, relieved for
ever from the necessity of earning their own
livelihood. This is contrary to all of nature’s
laws. It is a violent disturbance of the regular
arrangement of the world, according to which
every living being is compelled to win for himself
his place at the great table of nature, or else
perish. This disturbance of nature’s regulations
is the cause of all the evils of the economic world.
And while it condemns enormous masses of in-
dividuals to wretchedness and want, it at the
same time, takes its revenge upon its originators.
It is in vain that the rich withdraw from the
commonwealth their accumulated possessions
with unconsciously criminal egotism, in order to
ensure a life of luxury and leisure to their chil-
dren and their children’s children forever, they
never accomplish their design. Experience
teaches us that no wealth lasts through
several generations without some business efforts.
Inherited fortunes never remain long in a
family, and even Rothchild’s millions may not
protect his descendants of the sixth or eighth
generation from poverty, unless they possess those
qualities which would have enabled them to win
a high place for themselves in the world without
any inherited millions. These facts show the
operation of an implacable law, which is con-
stantly striving to bring about an equilibrium in
the economic life of society, so grievously dis-
turbed by the unnatural conditions of inherited
property. An individual who has never been
confronted with the necessity of calling his most
primitive organic instinct—the acquiring of food—
into play, soon loses the ability to retain his pos-
sessions and to defend them against the
greed of those without possessions, who en-
croach upon him on every side. Only when
all the descendants of a family are absolutely
mediocre natures, and live far from all public and
private agitation, in complete obscurity, the world
forgetting and by the world forgot, leading a
regular vegetable existence, can they hope to
retain undiminished the possessions that form their
heritage. But as soon as this family produces an
individual gifted with more imagination, who sur-
passes in any direction the standard of mediocrity
prevalent in the family, with passions or ambi-
tion, eager to shine or at least to appreciate
life’s possibilities, the family inheritance is
decreased or ruined, because this off-shoot of the
wealthy family is absolutely incapable of
replacing even one penny of the sums he spends
in the gratification of his whims. It is with
wealth as it is with an organism. The latter must
have vital activity to maintain life ; as soon as the
vital processes cease in its cells it falls a prey to
corruption, and is consumed by the microscopic
beings with whom nature is teeming, seek-
ing whom they may devour. In the same
way we can say that life becomes extinct in a
fortune in which the vital processes of exchange
and circulation are not carried on, so that it is
preyed upon and soon devoured by the greedy
companions of corruption, the parasites, swindlers,
cheats and speculators. The body of a fortune
can be artificially protected against decay and
putrefaction as well ns a human body ; the latter
by antiseptics, the former by a special law—
which ensures the perpetuation of the property
intact, that is, the law of entail. This law of
entail is an invention which affords us an interest-
ing proof of the fact that the rich egotists have
always had a dim suspicion of the unnaturalness
of the right of inheritance. The man of wealth
feels that he is committing a crime against
humanity and that nature will take her revenge
upon his descendants for his contempt of her
laws, consequently he erects a last barrier against
her assault. He foresees that his children will not
have arms strong enough to hold fast to their
heritage, so he ties it to their bodies with ropes
and c rds that no one can unfasten. But even the
law of entail, this carbolic acid bath for dead for-
tunes, loses its efficacy after a while and ceases to
protect the inherited wealth against corruption
and decay and the family against economic ship-
wreck.
* * *
The right of inheritance must be abolished.
This is the only natural and hence the only pos-
sible cure for the ulcers in the body of society
caused by the present conditions of political
economy. Such a proposition seems extremely
radical at the first glance, appearing to be practi-
cally the confiscation of all individual property.
But examined closer, we find that it is only the
consistent development of certain phenomena now
existing, which cause no one uneasiness. The
right of primogeniture is maintained in those
countries which cling most tenaciously to the
feudal organisation of society. This right con-
sists m the systematic disinheritance of all the
children, all the descendants, with the exception
of one, the first-born; so that it is identical with
my proposition, with this one exception. Hence
we see that the most conservative peer of England
carries my proposition into action, although it
may seem so revolutionary to some of my readers.
If we see nothing wrong, and certainly nothing
impossible, in the exclusion of all the children and
descendants of an English nobleman, except the
first-bora, from their share in the enjoyment
of the fortune he leaves behind him at his
death, why should we consider it wrong or
impossible to treat all the children of the
man of wealth in the same way? It is
true that the peer who disinherits his younger
children gives them other possessions, educa-
tion and training, which enable them to take
their places in society. But if all accumula-
tions of property passed into the possession of the
community upon the death of the accumulator
the State would be able to give all the youth of
the land an education and training adapted to
their capacity, and all the disinherited would
have at least the same advantages as are enjoyed
to-day by the disinherited younger son of the
peer. But the peer provides for his younger chil-
dren to w T hom he bequeaths none of his wealth, by
employing his family and political connections to
obtain situations for them in the service of the
State, community, or among his friends, which
have more or less the character of a benefice or
perpetual office. What is this more than an
organised solidarity, which offers the individual
even greater securities for a comfortable existence
than an independent fortune ? It is true this soli-
darity is narrow and selfish ; it is confined to one
caste and has for its sole purpose the plundering
of the majority for the benefit of a few parasites.
Let us imagine the limits of this solidarity
widened to include the whole community, and its
purpose, not to support parasites, but to perform
necessary and useful work ; let us imagine a state
which provides instruction and —if the parents
are incapable of bearing the expense*—food, cloth-
ing and shelter for all the children within its
limits until they are old enough to enter upon
their business career, and when this time arrives,
supplies them with tools and materals for inde-
pendent labour. In such a community of fellow-
ship would not each individual be well provided
for, and would the absorption of the father’s
wealth at his decease into the public treasury be
an act of injustice against the children?
(to be continued.)
A True Bill.
Dr. Morgan T. Willis, a recognised American
authority on cerebral disease and insanity, writes:
“ It is well for us to know that the emotions cause
more unhappiness and crime than any other func-
tion of the brain. Human beings are governed by
their emotions, and it is well that they should be,
though it is emotions that wear away the brain.
It is the emotions such as anxiety, fear, sorrow
and love. I consider that eight hours are suffi-
cient for a man to use his brain, because if he
exceeds that time he becomes nervous and fretful,
and an exhausted brain is an irritable brain. You
may not feel the evil effects of the stress of brain
work at the time, but you will sooner or later,
when it will be too late. The men that work at
night with their brains are the ones that expose
themselves to danger and death, which will surely
come unless the great strain on the mind is
lightened.
Any man that neglects the first warning of a
brain or nervous system that is becoming ex-
hausted, overtaxed or about to break down, is not
only a fool but a criminal. These signs are not
many, but they tell the story of coming dangers
only too plainly. Headache, sleeplessness, irrita-
bility of temper, neuralgic pains about the head
and heart, unrefreshful sleep, nervous dyspepsia,
dull eyes, heaviness of the head, and stupid feel-
ing after meals, worry about trifles, unreasonable
anger, tingling and numbness in the limbs, cold
feet and hands, flushed face and burning ears,
palpitation of the heart, and irregular, weak and
unsteady pulse. When you note these symptoms
beware; the brain and nerves are about to break
down, and it may be insanity, perhaps death.”
Eor all such troubles we recommend Clements
Tonic. This is a scientific specific, brain and
nerve food, and positively repairs the ravages of
overwork, time, disease, &c.
If Clements Tonic was not genuine, would the
Kiama Reporter call it “ The remedy of the
day,” or the Tamworth News say it was “A
specific for all diseases of debility,” or the Goul-
burn Post say it was “A Radical Cure,” or the
Newtown Chronicle say it was “ A Remedy of
approved efficacy,” or the Nepean Times call it
“A really first-class Tonic,” or the Macleay
Argus say “It is a reliable article,” or The
Bulletin say “It is a remedy of the highest
value,” or the Grafton Grip say “Praise is
superfluous,”or theBiNGERA Telegraph designate
it “A valuable medicine,” or the Presbyterian
say, “It can be confidently prescribed.” Yet all
these papers have printed these words in con-
nection with Clements Tonic. The press is far
too conservative to endorse an unproved article,
but we can show hundreds of similarly eulogistic
comment from the press similar to the above.
We don’t need to guarantee when we can get dis-
interested part’es to speak of Clements Tonic as
the journalists do.

Mv Dear Moorabinda,—
The concert organised by Miss Woolley in aid of the
N.S.W. Women’s College and held at the Sabbath-day’s-
Journey-from-tovvn situated University, on 16th instant,
was a mild, unexciting success. Baron and Lady Caring-
ton attended, the lady appearing in pale-pink striped
silk, white lace and diamonds, with a cluster of white
roses in her hair, and a wrap of pleated chiffon ; Miss
Walenn wore yellow silk and brown velvet, crimson
velvet opera-wrap; Mayoress Burdekin, black lace over
maize satin, with fawn gloves and diamond bracelets. The
card was most artistically arranged if the assisting
Cecilia choir was not. They were all in white, certainly
but some had trimmed themselves with a contrast 0i
velvet and flowers, and they wriggled like eels in
evolving the choruses—one massive lady with diamond
earrings carried on when the music grew allegro as if she
was learning to spar. Miss Pedley, in a fine blue gown
figured in white splashes, unwisely exercised her mezzo-
soprano in a contralto song (“ He thinks I do not love
him ”) ; Mrs. Mason, in cream Russian net and satin and
ostrich-feathers, evolved “An Olden Tryst” as if she
were drawing corks with her teeth ; Mrs. Simmons (Miss
Nancy Evans), in black, played piano soli, one of which
sounded as if she was tickling the übiquitous instrument,
and a Mr. Dobbie and the Sydney Liedertafel made very
tuneful stop-gaps. All the fair soloists were presented
with flowers.
A distressful screech has lately gone up over the in-
creasing numbers of those conscienceless people who
attend private balls, “at homes,” and so on, uninvited,
and shake hands confidently with the bewildered host and
hostess. To the man in a dress-suit, or the damsel who
possesses a striking d6collet6, it’s easy to force an entry
to such festivities, as “ tickets, please,” are not demanded
at the front door, and the servant unquestioningly admits
anybody who turns up in a “cloud ” or a Scotch cap.
One way out of the difficulty would be for each hona-fide
guest to bring his or her (the uninvited are generally
“her,” by the way) pasteboard permit along, and anybody
who couldn’t produce it should be hurled into outer
darkness—and yet such a rale wouldn’t work everywhere.
In a house with a large garden, for instance, the irre-
pressible female panting for the social whirl could get
over the rear-fence, deposit her wraps under a laurel, and
turn up smiling in the conservatory.
Lady Hopetoun has vanished in what (from a strictly
plebeian standpoint) looks like a huff with hubby, who
was unconcernedly tottering round Bendigo inspecting
the pound and the watch-house and the pump while his
colleen embarked on the first stage of the homeward
journey from Spencer-street surrounded by a gang of
sycophantic adorers of both sexes who were thirsting to
discover what is the correct vice-regal number of hat-
boxes to pile on top of the porter. In the farce “On an
Island,” “She’’says, “We must be as utter strangers 1”
and “He ” : “ Yes, just as if we were married.” But not
even a C.M.G. expects the aristocracy to wave loving fare-
wells from the pier-head with its bandanna tied to the top
of its umbrella.

goes on the snowy warpath on her own account. From

If a bald-headed Darby is her idea of a matrimonial mark,
why doesn’t she learn to kick with a view to joining a
comic-opera troupe ?
Quite the latest for summer weddings is to have every-
thing white, from the bride’s cheeks to the china. The
male guests don’t wear white, but come as near to
harmony as they, can in vests, ties and gloves, and the
table-decorations must have no ferns or colour of any kind
about them. White weddings are a very cool, sentimental
idea, but very suggestive of a matrimonial frost.
There is a feeling of general joy among the nursing
profession of Victoria just now. They are glad because,
at a meeting of the Charities Commission, it was urged
that the status of the nurse be elevated as much as
possible, and now the Melbourne Doras go about with a
Vere de Vere smile and a far-away gleam of pedigree in
their forget-me-not eyes, and put jelly to the feet and
mustard-plasters inside the patient who doesn’t rank with
the aristocracy. It was also mooted that their wages (the
coarse Commission called it “wages”) be raised, hours
shortened, and the “course” be divided between the
different hospitals, so that Sister Mary will be quite hope-
lessly muddled as to what is the right, ointment to rub on
a wooden leg. But it is the improved status idea that
takes the trick. The chief fascination of the nursing pro-
fession (in itself a hideous occupation for a woman who
can find anything else under Heaven to do) is the off-
chance of becoming Mrs. (“Doctor”) Lancet. Alas, poor
man, ever art thou a victim to thy environment 1
There is only a slight love thread-running through " A
Pair of Spectacles,” at Sydney Criterion, with Lilian
Scccomhe as the bazaar-haunting sweetheart in a black
gown with a blue how at the neck surmounted by a
Hamlet hat with jutting black, hearselike feathers and
bows of ribbon ; but as Mrs Goldfinch, Mrs. Brough
wears three special costumcsfr Dock first is a “ straw-
berrtcs and-cream ” morning gown, the over-dress of
cream silk flowered with strawberry-pink flowers, the
fronts and high collar lined with strawberry silk, undo ,
dress of white mull with folded bodice, the scarf tin.
loosely in front and the edge of the underdress finished
with pink fringe. Thrill two is a sage-green cashmere
with skirt panels, French bodice and sleeve-epaulettes of
sage-green silk brocaded in dark-green velvet leaves. The
last is lavender-grey poplin with sleeves, and deep, van-
dyked band round the feet of deep grey velvet to match.
In the rather forced curtain piece, “On An Island,”
where the dialogue is as scrappy as if the author had
shaken all the sentences together in a hat, Mrs. Brough
wears a simple dress of navy-blue pongee tellingly sue
mounted by scarlet poppies—a few grouped at the waist
with good effect.
I wonder who is responsible for the weird and wonder-
ful curtsy of the well-matured concert singer ? Is it
the teacher’s idea still clung to by the otherwise modern
pupil? Or is it an unfortunate internal upheaval coming
on like a stroke? For the concert curtsy is a strange>
complex manoeuvre beginning with a wriggle, with a
duck in the centre and a final climactic circular scoop to
the horizontal, accompanied by smiles of gratifying width
and sweetness, and an upward glancing of the eye dimly
suggestive of fits. The latest authorities assert that th e
correct platform bearing is a barely perceptible inclina-
tion of the head to the admiring house, and there is at
least one teacher in Sydney whose pupils sometimes
mount the giddy platform, who in very vivid English
altogether forbids them to curtsy. An artiste is only
tolerable corkscrewing around her train when she is being
showered with bouquets ; scudding under bare poles, so
to speak, the wreathed grins, the undulations and the
oglings seem like giving the company over-weight.
In reading the list of successful competitors at Sydney
’Varsity exams, one is reminded of a manifest injustice
done to a great number of capable governesses in the
country who train their pupils up to passing-point, single,
handed, only to be told that “ Pa ” thinks Maria ought to
get a metropolitan brush-up and intends sending her to
a “finishing” city school for a quarter, where she very
often only recapitulates her studies ami then goes
through the mill and passes in the name of the academy
At the recent exams, one girl who rubbed through had
been but eight weeks at the high-class establishment
which got all the credit and the big advertisement. Such
is life.
Somebody wails to your Sappho that Sydney Beauty
doesn’t furbish up her masticators to ivory-point, as she
should do if she wishes to smile a white, glittering smile,
and not a yellow, mossy grin, at her fellow-beings. But
‘he truth is the long, yellow Australian fang won’t take a
Howir
polish, and only gleams like oiled orange-peel even after
weeks of elbow-grease. And when it isn’t yellow, it is of
that transparent pearl-grey which indicates stopping and
filling and hauling out, and, no matter how much charcoal
is used, the dentals always look like boiled-beans while
there are any left. And as there are enough false fangs
in Australia to make a girdle round the world, and as the
moral aspect of false teeth requires that they be taken
out and soaked in water every night, the charge of
unclean ivories can’t have much foundation,
I am told that a Sydney musician, whose amaranthine
locks float on the dusty breeze, washes his hair before he
goes out of a morning and dries it as he gets townwards
on the top of the ’bus. One day somebody dropped a little
soda in the water, and the gifted artiste had to go about
ail day with a head like a sea-egg.
At a Patey concert the other evening somebody threw
Mr. Patey a nosegay, which he didn’t see. When
Madame came on to take an encore, her practised eye
detected the bunch of greens, which she picked up and
kissed in a fetchingly effusive way, and bore off in
triumph. Poor Mr. Patey! Perhaps he saw it and. was
too bashful to know what to do with it. He could hardly
have kissed it rapturously as his wife did, because—well he
is quite bald enough already.
1 have been to interview the Phonograph, now squeak,
ing in the Centenary Hall. Its re-productions of instiu-
mental music are absolutely fascinating, and if the voice-
re-productions are true to tone, I must congratulate Glad-
stone in possessing a voice the J'ac-*imUc of Robert
Brough’s. I was beguiled into warbling into the long tin
funnel, and screeched thereinto with a shrill head-note on
which I rather plume myself. When if was given hack it
sounded like escaping steam, mixed with the yell of a
badly-lost soul, and as everybody said it was just like my
voice, I suppose I should have felt satisfied.
A direful style, sure to be seized by ladies of an artistic
turn who possess gardens, or live next door to them, is to
merely trim your dashing top-dressing with a handful of
vegetables, taken from the face of Nature and held in
perky place by a long, homicidal bonnet-pin. Artisti-
cally-arranged flowers look very graceful when put up,
hut unless you have water on the brain to keep the stalks
in, don’t lock in the glass at your dandy hat after a
quarter of an hour of sun. Summer roses arc constructed
to fade and moult their petals at critical moments, and a
“shapo” garlanded with hyhiscus, which folds into purple
umbrellas when two minutes off the tree, or pansies which
shrivel up like fried mushrooms, or westeria which turns
up its toes at a zephyr, will look after half-an-hour as if
the bearer had emptied the contents of a neglected vase
upon her devoted skull. A woman crowned in natural
blossoms sounds poetic but looks a guy—as does the
sweet innocent who garlanding herself with flowers lie
sent, goes to a ball, and finds after twenty minutes of
hopping that a shower of petals and one long, bare,
reproachful stalk is all she has to go upon.
Yours affectionately,
SAPPHO SMITH.
The farewell ball to Lady Carington, to be held in the

Sydney ’Varsity Dramatic Society wisely give their per-
formance of “Friar Bacon and Friar Bungay” in the
Standard Theatre, on Ist prox., instead of forcing people
to rush out to the impossibly-placed seat of learning im-
mediately after dinner. Louise Davenport will take the
part of “ Margaret,” and the rehearsals have been most
successful.
Mr. and Mrs. S. A. Fullford have issued invitations for
a ball to eventuate at their residence, Norwood, Hurst-

The marriage of Miss “ Altie” Wright, daughter of Mr.
F. A. Wright, M L.A., of “ Sunnihilda,” Putney, Sydney,
to Mr. H. P. K. Copeland, takes place at St. Ann’s, Hyde,
on 29th instant. A reception will be held at “Sunni-
hilda” after the ceremony.
The “at home ” on board H.M.S. Orlando (in docl )
on Kith inst. was a crowded function, in fact, if a girl hau
attended in a potato-bag and blucher boots there
wouldn’t have been space to remark her. Dancing, flirt-
ing, and refreshments (though perhaps those last go
together) were the order of the afternoon which was blue
and breezy.
People who don’t know whether zephy rs are fashion-
able for children will learn with avidity that Lady
Carington has ordered frocks in pink, blue, and white
zephyr for her little daughters who are also being made
“fishwife” frocks to wear on the home voyage, packing
operations for which will commence at once.
A few enthusiasts rolled tearfully up to Government
House, Sydney, on 18th inst., mistaking it for the date of
the farewell Saturday reception. The sobbing soldier on
guard leant upon his sword and explained matters in a
choked voice, and the deputation put its handkerchief
back into its pocket and stowed the uncontrollable
anguish until 25th inst.
Mr. and Mrs. D. C. Bell, of Double Bay, gave a most
successful musical “At Home ”on 16th inst. Mrs. Bell
wore cream surah relieved with heliotrope ruches, and
sang “Dear Heart” effectively. Mrs. Bell, sen., wore
amber silk draped in black lace and bouquet of butter-
cups ; Miss Nightingale (Melbourne) appeared in a hand-
some black corded silk gown. The supper-table was very
daintily set out.
The marriage of Mr. Albert E. Cohen, sub-editor of the
Dunedin (N.Z.) Evening Star, with Miss Minnie Levy, of
Sydney, took place in the Synagogue, Sydney, on 14th
inst. The bride wore cream faille and hrocade relieved
with snowdrops, and the three bridesmaids were in cream
“liberty.” Honeymoon at Katoomba.
The complaint is spreading hopelessly. Sir Henry
Norman, the dried-up-looking Queensland potentate, has

Mr. O. O. Dangar, who had a pleasant
habit of talking with the N.S.W. Opposition—
to which he nominally belonged—and voting with
the Government, to which he was a good friend,
has been solemnly fired out by his alleged party.
Mr. J. H. Young having reluctantly
resigned--not because ho was insolvent, but
because it seemed probable that he would be fired
out for being insolvent—the N.S.W. Assembly
will, ere this is published, probably have elected a
new Speaker. That new Speaker will presumably
be J. 1*. Abbott, a slippery and ungraspable politi-
cian of whom both parties enthusiastically desire
to get > id for ever and ever, Amen !
We have received two very fine and well
finished photos, of Speaker Young from Messrs
Gharlemont & Co.

When Bradlaugh was contesting North
ampton, at a time when the Tories expected his

Sydney still rings with stories tolling
against Lord Carington’s vice-regal predecessor,
and it is expected, says the Hawk, that Lord
Augustus Loftus, who used to have a pungent
pen, will, in his reminiscences, retort in a style to
make the New South Welsh squirm.
The late Judge Molesworth took no holi-
days in 30 years. What a model! The rule is for
a judge to be a used-up barrister, whose doctors
imperatively order a trip to Europe when he has
been about 18 months on the bench. Thencefor-
ward it is regarded as a cruel hardship for him to
sit at all.
The premises of Messrs. Wallach in York-
street have been lately adorned by the insertion
of, perhaps, the largest plate-glass window in
Sydney where are exposed for the inspection of
passers by various handsome specimens of the
upholsterer’s art, draperies and curtains of diverse
hue and materials. Inside the building is hand-
somely decorated, the ceiling ornamentations being
of zinc, and the wall decorations tasteful. One
showroom is wholly devoted to the display of
drapery drawn from all parts of the globe ; another
to carpets, rugs, and floor-coverings of similar
genesis ; yet another solely to dining-room furni-
ture, including a suite which gained the gold
medal at the Melbourne International Exhibition.
The next show-room is laid out with bedroom
suites of the most delicate and tasteful, yet dur-

Pel'cy Warphy, Es<p, J.P., of Colliils-
fefcfwefc, East Melbourne, of Blank House, Elstern-
AVlck, of Wat phi ri Station on the Lower Darlitlg,
and of Warphy ’s Plains Station in the “NeVer-
NcVer ” country, was, prior to the bursting of the
land-bubble in 1889* Otic bf the greatest of Vic-
toria’s great men. He was so very great that he
bOnldaifofid to contemptuously despise the Parlia-
mentary honours which both Upper and Lower
Ittihse constituencies would willingly have thrust
Upon him. Hehad .no ambition to seat himself
amohg Parliamentarians; he preferred to use
them. From the inner of the two small rooms
which composed his offices he pulled political and
financial wires that made other men who loomed
very largely indeed in the public eye step it
through puppet dances Which had all the grace of
■ spontaneous movement, and which, therefore, de-
ceived the owners of the eye into the reversal of
an old adage. They paid the piper, but they
did not Ordefi the tune. It was Mr. Warphy who
attended to that part of the game. He would
order a Railway waits, or a Tramway quadrille,
or a Public Company polka; and his puppets
Would dance gaily ; and the public paid gladly,
and bowed down before Mr. Warphy for giving
them the privilege of playing. Unquestionably a
great man, Mr. Warphy. So far as was popularly
known he had but two weaknesses. ( hie was an
admiration for the Tichborne claimant and a
belief in the authenticity of his claim —Mr.
Warphy was accustomed to say that the man who
formulated the profound maxim, “that them as
has no brains but lots o’ money is made for them
as has brains but no money,” was too wise to bo
associated with a fraud; and the other was an
unreasoning worship of his only (and motherless)
daughter, Alice.
He loved her so passionately that he had refused
for her an alliance with a ducal family because
he could not tolei’ate the idea that she should live
out of the colonies. Suitor after suitor had wooed
her .* some, heirs to leading squatting families;
others, with a gold or a silver mine in their
pockets; and he had refused them all, for they
were not worthy of her, he thought. The girl did
not complain, she was too happy at home. Beanti-
fui and cultivated, mistress of a private house
th a t would have supported half-a-dozen middle*
class families in comfort, and the centre of an
adoring circle, her life was passed amid all the
satisfaction possible from leisure adorned with
seemingly boundless Wealth, till her twenty-third
year. Then the inevitable man came; He was a
young barrister, with a little money, intelli-
Rent and pure-living,—and briefless. Mr. War-
phy’g influence soon corrected the solitary defect,
y OUU g tdah had two qualities which help k
iiotable career wheh backed up by much money;
Jjj ce i oV ed him; and as the young couple consented
ye w j fc jj him, Mr, Warphy agreed to their en-
gagement.
Tliey had been engaged just a year at Cup-time
1888, and their marriage was to take place at
All Saints, in the week succeeding the great race-
d The cer emony was to be one of the events
0 f B ie carnival time, and the great house at
Elsternwick, whose grants—they are cut up now
into timepayment allotments—ran on .the East to
the Brighton roa( l an d Q n the West to the fine
ebore of the Bay, was filled with guests gathered
f rom a p the provinces to do honour to the Race
and Weddin o- .
Q n ti U! night before the marriage, a cab, en-
gage(j a j. Spencer-street railway-station by a
gentleman who’had apparently arrived by the late
overland train from Sydney, drove up to the gate
opening on the Brighton road. The lodge-keeper
_ fol . Mr . Warphy boasted a lodge—threw open
the gates> and the cabman was about to enter the
avenne w h en he was checked by the hirer of the
vu hide, who, yelling out, said to the keeper:
« The cab wil i stop ] iere) t h an k you-I will walk
t o the house.” Turning to the driver, he whis-
pel.ed, inaudibly to the woman at the gate :“If I
do no t return within two hours—it is now ten
minutes to twelve—drive rapidly to the St. Kilda
police-station, by the Town Hall. You will find a
man waiting inside. Bring him here and take his
instructions. Not a word to anyone till then, or
J return. Do you understand ?” Two sovereigns
having clinked into the driver’s palm, the gentle-
man heard an obsequious “ Yes, sir,” that assured
him the man’s obedience.
“ Bah !” the visitor said to himself, as he passed
into the elm-lined avenue. “You can purchase
fidelity ! Take a fellow from the cab-rank, or the
gutter, a poor devil you have never seen before
an j w horn you never want to see again when yon
have kicked him aside after serving your ends,
and he is faithful to you. But only before you are
outbid. After all, there is something more potent
than gold. A great emotion will bind men to a
cause, or an idea, or a person, as money can never
do. A great love or a great bate—either will
resist the solvent of tie- gold. And that’s the
mistake you make, Warphy. my friend ! Your
system of philosophy lias never taken into account
anything but the dollar. You have overlooked
the magnetic power of an enduring hate, Warphy,
my—my enemy 1”
Mr. Percy Warphy’s midnight visitor laughed
softly as he concluded his soliloquy. The laugh
harmonised well with the pleasant features visible
beneath the travelling-cap, and anyone who had
heard it would have at once put the new arrival
down as a belated guest with charming manners;
Several persons, members of the house-party, who
tvere strolling by the moonlight through the shrub-
beries, and who saw him, thought so at least ahd
Wondered Who he was. Notwithstanding the
lateness of the hour and the imminence of the
morrow’s festival, the mansion was still alive witty
mirth and music, the ptinbipal door was opeil; alia
the spaeiolis hall Was luminous with a rosy light
diffused by lamps riestling in brackets of living
fern and palm.
The new-cottiet* stepped on to the verandah aS
the hall clock chimed midnight. Mr. Warphy,
tall, florid-faced, and portly-framed, rose on his
approach from a lounge, \Vhere, in company with
two or three other gentlemen, he had been smok-
ing a last cigar. “What, Mr. Tasker!” he ex-
claimed, as the lamp-gleams fell on the visitor’s
face; “this you! This is d pleasure! Your
clerk' sent us word you were away, in acknowledg*
nieht bf our card ”
“Yes,” interrupted Mr. Tasker, in his pleasant
tones, “ I was, but I returned unexpectedly.”
“And you came through at once—that was kind
of you! But come in—where’s your luggage?—
how did you come? Why didn’t you drive up to
the house ?” As he volleyed these questions at
the late arrival he led the way into the hall and
was about to ring for a servant when Mr. Tasker
stopped him.
“No,” he said, “I shall not stay to-night—
thanks! I want you to give me a few minutes —
say half-an-hour, if you can spare the time from
your guests. The matter is urgent—that must be
iny excuse for troubling you now, for of course
you would not care to be disturbed with business
details to-morrow .”
“ Your business,” rejoined Mr. Warphy,
unctuously, “will command my attention at any
ti me —even on my daughter’s wedding-day. But
I’m sorry you won’t stay—we can easily put you
up, although we are rather crowded.”
“No, I’ll not stay ; and I’ll defer the pleasure
of offering my congratulations to Miss Warphy ”
—Mr. Warphy was leading the way upstairs to
the drawing-room—“if yon don’t mind. Where
oan we have a few minutes together?”
Mr. Tasker had imported a degree of decisive-
ness into the soft modulation of his voice that
made his host lose a little of his vivid colour ; just
the instantaneous paling of the cheek that attacks
a man upon whose present well-ordered life the
masked battery of an old-time sin suddenly opens
fire; and the observant blue eyes of the midnight
guest noticing it, gleamed more brilliantly.
“Well, I’m sorry you’ll not honour us by
remaining,” said Mr. Warphy; “we shall be midis-
turbed in the library.” With that, he preceded
Mr. Tasker into a room lined with bookcases, and
opening from the hall, and permitting egress
through the French windows on to a verandah
overlooking the sea.
“My little girl,” he continued as he placed a
chair for Mr. Tasker, and turned up the reflector-
lamps, “iny little girl will be delighted to heat
who my late caller is. She has some OUriolts
romanticisms about her, the silly thing—remilns*
cences of her poor, dead mother !—and she bade
hie observe who was the first to step over the
threshold after midnight. ‘ The litst visitor.
then,’she said, ‘ brings me my fortune, father, tot
he comes on my marriage morn.’ Ahd, Of bolirsbi
Ivhen I tell her who did come, she will bebharmed
at the happjr omen.;’ _ * . .
“You think so?” inquired Mr. JaskeL anti lie
coughed, as he spoke, softly—“ I m ffatteted, I'nl
Sure.” , , ... ~
44 Not at all! Ins host exclaimed, with a tin ill
in his accents that was not altogether affected;
“ No one knows how much I owe to you.
“You exaggerate your obligation to iiie,' Ivas
what Mr. Tasker said to Mr. Warphy. What lie
said to himself was ; “Well, perhaps not.' And.
then, after a pause, he addressed Mr. Warphy in
some very serious sentences, but without with*
drawing from his tones the ripple of their music.
Tobn Tasker had made his speaking voice a
study as great vocalists do their singing organs,
and he used it as artistically. Half his power lay
in his bank-book ; but the magic of much of ms
mighty personal influence was contained in the
flexibility and range of his voice. Now, when he
was about to utter terrible words, his tones pre-
served their music. They rose and fell in a
perfect cadence.
* # #
„,, . T
Before, however, we report wnat John
Jasker said, let us say who Tohn Tasker was.
“John Tasker, speculator,” as he called himself
when he had to state his “ trade or profession, ’
was the substance of whom Percy Warphy, Esq.,
T.P., was a mere shadow—one of many shadows ;
for Tohn Tasker’s personality presented many
f a cets to the sun. There were many Warphys ;
there was only one Tasker. The one used .the
many; made them dance as they in their turn
made others dance ; they, too, were simple
puppets in his hands. In gold, in silver, in tin,
in wool and grain, in ships and coal, in lands and
houses, in almost every form of industrial enter-
prise, in Government stocks, in that most mer-
chantable of commodities—political honour; in all
these things Tohn Tasker speculated and jobbed,
Not three men in the Australias knew the
greatness of his power, or the ramification
G f his affairs ; but when Tay re-
ceived a cable message signed “ Tasker, he
thought twice over it, and Rothschilds had a code
of which the duplicate never left Tohn Taskers
pocket-book. Nominally the employer of a
solitary clerk—a grim-featured and taciturn corn-
bination of shabby tweed and dirty collar—Tasker
set and kept going the labour of an army. An
army? No; a people.
His shadows did not know one another. The
most substantial shadow of the lot, Warphy, did not
know three others who stood towards Tasker in a
like relation, though he believed there were scores,
When Warphy received a brief memo, to the effect
that the purchases of the current year’s clip or
harvest were to go “home” in Messrs. Mayne
and Maste’s new steamship, Mr. Warphy might
BU t but did not ,know for certain that M. and
constituted another of Tasker’s shadows,
When Wulebale and Co., Limited, “of Aus-
j.ralia” (for had they not a branch in every
cap i ta l, and an agency in every pastoral town?)
we P re « advised ”by “T.T.” to get all the stores
required for the hundreds of stations on their
books from a certain quarter; its managing-


Scan.

y y* V/ vy
directors, too, might suspect that J. J.’s shadow
fell in that particular quarter ; but they could not
know. And when the new Mammoth Bank was
similarly instructed to grant Wulebale and Co. all
desired accommodation, its recently imported In-
spector (while obeying) used to smile when he
heard “ the enormous development of Wulebale’s
business since it became a joint-stock concern,”
spoken of on ’Change. Fossile, Blaze and Co.,
great colliery agents, could not understand why
JiJ. insisted Upon their buying for export from
the Jumbuck Colliery, which bharged one shilling
it ton aboVe “Vend” rates; and the Jumbuck
hianagemeht would give no satisfactory explana-
tion to the “ Vend ” bosses why they paid their
hewers and drawers at a higher rate than the
V Vend ” scale —for the Jumbuck people eoitld not
divest themselves of their substantial importance
which clothed them in the eyes of the Associated
Collieries and the community generally, by declar-
ing that they were merely acting on Mr. Jasker’s
instructions. Morgan and Barryer (Melbourne),
Morgan and Co. (Brisbane and Sydney), Barryer
and Co. (Adelaide and Broken Hill), the great
mining- brokers, “ who would never touch a shady
thing, sir,” trembled for their safety and their
reputation at some of the operations they had
been compelled to conduct at Jasker’s bidding;
the British-Antipodean Loan and Mortgage
Finance Association (paid-up capital, £2,000,000)
had an imposing (sham) directorate, but was ruled
by J asker; and it was Jasker who communicated
a “ code cable ” to the Honourable the Treasurer
to warn him that if the new five-million loan was
put on the market before such a date, it would be
made a failure.
People knew he was rich, but as to the extent of
his wealth, any more than as to the range of his
business, no one, save his old clerk, could speak.
Once a lady, Who, was as Well acquainted with him
iii 3 anyone, asked him, frankly: “What are you
Worth, Mr. Jasker?” And he had made her this
response : “If you mean morally, madam—l am
Worth nothing ;if you mean monetarily—l cannot
siy. You must ask my clerk, John Denham.”
Men in the inner circles of finance put him men-
tally down as a bi-millionaire in his own right, and
as commanding ten millions of foreign capital.
However, none could assert with truth that he
could ever guess at John Jasker’s means. The
physical shell of the man was, as we have hinted,
agreeable to the sight. Slightly over the medium
height, his fifty-odd years of life had left his hair
untinted with grey, and had done no more in
passing than press a gentle finger on his forehead.
His eyes were deep-set, and penetrated with a
steady sharpness into any opposing nature, but, as
as a rule, they looked liquidly on men and things.
His voice we have already described.
He had never married. When taxed with his
bachelordom, he would reply : “ I am wedded to
—business —” And he would complete the sen-
tence under his breath: “And my business is
revenge. ”
* * *
To go on with our story.
As Jasker took his seat, by a ’seemingly careless
sweep of his arm, he tilted a lamp-shade. The
light of the lamp was, in this way, thrown on
Warphy’s face, while his own sank into deeper
shadow. Mr. Warphy’s palate grew dry as he
noticed the action. He kpew then that he was to
be placed in the rack whereon he had so frequently
placed others.
“You marry your daughter to-morrow, Mr.
Warphy ? ”
“ Yes ! ” For the life of him Mr. Warphy could
nob prevent his fear imparting itself to the petty
monosyllable.
“ And — you will excuse the question to an old—
friend—may I ask what dowry you propose to give
her ? ”
“ Twenty-five thousand 1 ” was the stammered
reply.
“ Of my money ? ”
You would haVe thought Mr. Jasker Was utter-
ing an endearment. There was a caress in every
syllable of the startling question. Startling it
was; it shocked the blood from Mr. Warphy’
countenance and left it a dull, ashen grey. He
did not answer, dnd the interrogatory was re-
peated ; repeated with a softer music.
“ What—do—you—mean ? ” he gasped at last.
“ Listen —listen intently ! ” said Mr. Jasker.
As though arty mart not a Notfolk Island “ demon”
or a Format of New Caledonia would not listen
intently to his death-sentence ! And Mr. Jasker
spoke at length, putting sibillanoes and cadences
into his speech as if he were wooing a capricious
beauty.
“ Warphy, you are hi difficulties! Warphy,
you are ruined ! Warphy, you are in danger of
Queen-street —and the dock ! And yet you can
wear a smile—and marry your daughter! You
are a brave man, Warphy. That is, if you are not
the most consummate of rogues ! ”
“Not that—not that,” moaned Warphy. The
man had shrunk visibly ; his very body seemed to
have withered; and, as to his face, it was distorted
like a paralytic’s.
“Don’t interrupt, please,” Mr. Jasker pro-
ceeded. “The most consummate of rogues—or
else a very brave man. For you greeted me with
a smile and a word of hearty welcome, and ten-
dered me a hand-clasp which would have been
tVarnl, doubtless, had I accepted it. Did you notice
I didn’t take your hand ? I am not a punctilious
man—you know that —but I could not take your
hand —knowing what I know —and intending to
do what I propose.” But this last assertion he
breathed to himself.
“ And what is your position ? Suppose I answer
my own question? You have over-speculated in
land—you helped to originate a ‘ boom’ which has
already ruined hundreds, and will yet ruin thou-
sands. You were not to be ruined, of course ; you
were to build a huge fortune on others’ downfall.
But, as it happens, you are ruined—you are
another Frankenstein—tortured and destroyed by
the monster you created. You will observe”—and
he paused pleasantly to throw a gibe at the wretch
before him —“ a man of your literary tastes ’’—here
he pointed to the book-cases —“cannot have failed
to observe that I did not speak of Frankenstein
as being the monster —you are not suffering from
the Frankenstein, for you are Frankenstein. But
I do not mean to imply you are not a monster as
well. That is where Mrs. Shelley’s romance is
weak. She should have made Frankenstein and
the monster different aspects of the one dual per-
sonality. But she couldn't do so, for she tried too
soon—she was not acquainted with the land-boom
organiser of this day.” He paused to laugh .
merrily. The ashert face across the table twitched
in agony. The scalpel had cut a nerve.
“Yes,” he went on, “ the forces you originated,
have destroyed you. Ycrur buyers cannot’ com-
plete their contracts, they have forfeited deposits
and thrown a score of blocks on your hands ; and
your dummy companies cannot unload on to the
public. The confiding public is confiding no
longer—will be more-distrustful still a month—a
Week hence. You have not, it is true, forfeited
your deposits to your Vendors; you have honour-
ably kept your engagements—honourably, I say,
have you not ? You have carried out contracts un-
flinchingly. To-day your name stands higher
than ever because you have done so. Men say on
’Change, in the banks, in the auction-rooms, that
you have not been ‘hit’—that you have made
money when men hitherto reputed to be as bril-
liant financiers as your are, have lost it, because
you have not been afraid to look losses boldly in
the face. Men say so, about you—and I know
differently, ’’
The massive library-clock struck one . The
stricken man’s head bent lower as the deep respn-
ance echded through the room. It brought to his
mind the soul-bell. Mr. Jasker waited till the
sound died away.
“ I asked for half-an hour—l have already taken
an hour, and am afraid I must trespass yet a little
longer on your time. But you Will forgive me, I
know, considering the urgency.” Again the
cadence of his laugh rang out pleasantly.
“ You —and I—and my confidential clerk, John
Denham, know differently. We three understand
how it is that your name and your bills have not
gone to protest together—how it is your banker
still replies “ Good for any amount!” to arixious
queries as to your standing—how it is that, with
a shrinkage of nearly a-fifth of a million in the
values of your properties, a shrinkage that must
double itself within six months, you can still keep
your credit good and a smile on your face —and
how it is you can marry your daughter !”
Warphy rose up, the man within him flickered
into mad gestures for a moment only. Throwing
himself again into his chair he groaned and
sobbed. And Mr. Jasker looked on and smiled.
When he resumed his talk he purred into a more
sympathetic softness.
“Wfe know—we three—that you have used
trust funds—money entrusted to fOti bjr me ; that
ypu have also taken advantage of my carte-blajich'e
to draw on Jephson’s, London, as against wool
and grain purchases which you have not made;
that you have obtained huge advances on scrip
belonging to me but lodged in your hands for
facility of operation. You have done these things,
and more. You have done them all, of course,
with the intention of repaying the amounts when
you realised on your properties, and the shares
of the shoddy companies were transformed into
sovereigns that had nothing to do with shoddy.
And the properties are unrealised—and the public
refuse to be bled—and I want my money !”
He stopped for, it might be, two minutes.
Then, as there was no response, except the palsied
shaking of the man on the other side of the
table—what other could there be ?—he began
again.
“You are discourteous, friend Warphy—very!
To a man to ‘ whom you owe so much,’ too ! You,
who have the reputation of being so square and
polite to everybody except your unfortunate
debtors, to be rudely silent when a man asks you
for his money— it is surprising ! And so small a
sum, too! —merely a matter of one hundred
thousand pounds ”
Warphy glanced up. His face seemed less
ashen for a moment— it even took upon its outlines
a faint tinge of relief.
“Oh, if lam in error, please correct me ! Did
I overstate the amount—or understate it ? Sup-
pose we say twnrhundred thousand pounds,—a
quarter of a millioiT—three hundred thousand ”
The flash of colour passed from Warphy’s tor-
tured features as the hope that Jasker did not
know the extent of his fraudulent appropriations
receded from his heart.
“Let it stand at three hundred thousand— f 0
the time being. Now, Mr. Warphy, where is niv
money?—my three hundred thousand pounds?”
He waited for a reply—and waited. At last
the thing across the table whimpered, in child mi!
phrase : “ I haven’t got it!”
Mr. Jasker laughed gaily.
# * *
“Of course you haven’t! ” Jasker went
on to say as soon as he had had his laugh out
“ If I thought you had I shouldn’t have asked
you for it. But it has gone; and you cannot meet
my first demand ; and you are civilly liable to me ”
Again Warphy lifted his head ; again something
like hope glanced across his features. Jasker’s
next ff'o'rds bent the head, however, lower and
lower, and drew the shutter down over the loom
hole through which the hopeful gleam i lt Sj
filtered.
“ Civilly—arid criiriinally. Aye,- criminally (
Not to allude to what I don’t kriow, and speaking
only of what I know, I accuse you of criminal
conduct unsurpassed in our Australian annals
People have termed you a great man, Warphy.
You have done that which may—nay, does ill
entitle you to be called a great criminal. Your
crimes, like your ambitions, Warphy, have been
large—immense—mammoth ! You deserve g
chapter all to yourself in the Bingraphia Flagiiiosi
You understand the phrase, Warphy? It would
be an impertinence in me to translate it—for these
book-cases prove to me that you have kept up youy
studies in the intervals of your financial coups—
and your crimes. ”
He paused to yield himself once more to the
spirit of jocoseness that was fed by his own irony
When he spoke next, he had changed his tone. ly
was now respectful, if not cordial, with an inde-
finable masterfulness about it that implied to the
over-acute sensibilities of Warphy both the desire
arid the power to help Him in the extremity where
the antecedent speech had lodged Him,.
“Listen, again, Mr. Warphy,” Jaskef’ gifij
“You remember your father ?” Warphy rioclded
assent. “He was a good father to you ?”
“He was—a very good father.” Surely this
not the bold, resolute - tone of Mr. Percy
Warphy ?
“ You reverence his memory ?”
Again the sign of assent: to which Jasker
rejoined : “ That is well—you can the more
readily understand how I can reverence a parent.
Well, I am hei’e to-night to fulfil a parent’s wish!
My mother —whose memory I reverence as I
reverence nothing else —owes your father a debt.
She wished me to pay that debt to your father!
I could not —he died. But I may, I can, I will
pay it to his son.”
A great hope was shaping itself in Warphy’s
consciousness. He thought he understood that
prompted by some instinct of gratitude, Jasker
proposed to avert the disaster which his previous
words had threatened to unloose.
“My mother’s debt I will pay to your father's
son. You know who your father was? A prin-
cipal official of the convict establishment in
Sydney. But you do not know who my father
was, do you? He was—a convict—a transport
per ship Ocean. His name was John Jasker, too,
and his register number was No. 38,800. He was
transported for embezzlement embezzlement,
Mr. Warphy. Curious, isn’t it, how things
happen ? That’s what they would call your
crime, Mr. Warphy, for you were my servant
and not my agent —and was transported for seven

Mrs. HAYES
Proprietress.
years. My mother worked her fingers to the
bone, as the saying is—your daughter will never
have to do that, Mr. Warphy!—first, to support
herself and child—l was the child—and then to
earn our passages out, and followed him after
three years. On arrival, she was advised by a
good friend —one John Denham —yes, the same
John Denham who is now my clerk, to apply for
my father’s assignment to her. Such things were
done daily, but her application was refused; she
was not rich enough to grease the palms of the
officials ; and such things were seldom done when
people could not pay for them. But your father
heard of her story and put himself in communica-
tion with her. He saw her beautiful face —she
was very beautiful then, Denham says—and he
listened to her charming voice—people say I have
a pleasing voice, but Denham says her’s was perfect
music—and he promised her, not compliance with
her request, but more. He promised her his free-
dom. He had great power; as for pardons, such
a one he could have for the asking. He obtained
my father’s pardon ”
“ That was like him! ” interjected Mr. Warphy.
“He was ever generous!” A portion of the
man’s portliness came back to him as he reflected
that his thought was right. Jasker could mean
nothing else than to forget and forgive because of
that ancient service!
“Yes, he was generous,” Mr. Jasker exclaimed.
“He exacted only one condition—one slight con-
dition—and on the same condition, I will grant
you a release from your indebtedness to me, and
thus save you from the legal consequences of your
crime. That will be virtually giving you your
freedom, will it not?” Warphy lowered his
head.
“ Dreedom for Freedom ! ” Jasker resumed.
“You agree to that? I desire a verbal answer,
please.”
The hope leapt now into full life in Warphy’s
breast, and an overpowering thankfulness, also,
that his father had done that kindly act in the far-
distant past and thus interposed his dead hand
between his son and ruin—shame—death ! The
hands of the dead thrust themselves into the face
of the living, he thought, how often do they hold
within their grasp some dread penalty and some
immortal sin. But his father held out to him
from the grave, how blessed a good ! A spasmodic
exultation sent the blood coursing with new
vigour through his veins, and his manhood re-
turned to him for a second, as he uttered impetu-
ously—“ Yes, yes ! ”
“I am glad of that,” said Jasker. “Freedom
for freedom—freedom with a condition for free-
dom with a condition—that is fair ! The mother’s
debt paid to the father’s son. That is fair ! By
the way, does it occur to you that freedom for
freedom is, after all, but an application of the Lex
talionis? Do you see this ? Answer, please.”
“Yes !” murmured Warphy, who did not know
where all this was leading him.
“Ah, I am glad you see that! ’cried Jasker,
and, rising, he threw a terrifying stridence into
his next words ; “An eye for an eye—a tooth for
a tooth —a life for a life—freedom for freedom—
honour jor honour !”
For the second time that night, Warphy asked
the other what he meant.
“ What do I mean ?” Jasker hissed. “ I mean
that I will grant you immunity and safety —if you
grant me your daughter's honour /”
The clock here struck two, but it is doubtful if
either heard the gong. Warphy had risen, and
stood glancing at the man who had cast at him
that last vile sentence.
“My daughter’s—honour ! You are mad !” He
gathered at length sufficient power to say those
words.
Mr. Jasker went back to his seat, and, smiling,
adopted again the rippling softness of voice in
which he had spoken during the first part of the
the interview.
“No!” he said, “I am not mad! But listen
once more !”
And then he proceeded to describe to Warphy
one of those shameful transactions which was so
common in the palmy days of the System.
“There was my mother, beautiful, but friend-
less—for Denham had left Sydney—and starving,
with her child, in a strange land ! There was my
father—who could work to support his wife
and child if he were free, but who was “ under
bond.” There was your father—and he promised
to free the husband on condition that the wife
abandoned to him—herself, her honour. Do you
hear, Warphy? her honour—that was the condi-
tion on which alone he would help her.”
The sadness that Avas audible in the strong
man’s tones was not noAv a trick of the voice. It
expressed an epic grief.
“ She fought long before she yielded—she went
Ayithout food herself for days, she was threatened
with eviction from her paltry lodging into the
street; she would have invited that fate, with its
consequence of being sent to Parramatta Factory
as a vagrant —she would then, at least, have won
food for her boy—but for the dreadful companion-
ship of the Factory drabs. And at last the hour
came when her child cried for food, and she had
none to give it. She had seen that day, in the
iron-gang in the Domain, my father. She had
watched him at his work —they were quarrying on
the Woqlloomooloo aide—and had seized an
opportunity to speak to him, and to ask him how
he fared! “For God’s sake! Phoebe,” he whis-
pered, “move Heaven and hell to get me out of
here, or I die !” She could not tell him then of
her extremity—and that night your father had
his will.”
IB“ For some minutes there was no sound in the
room, save the beat of the clock, but to both men
the silence Avas vocal with the myriad tragedies of
the System.
“But I will say this for your father—he was
not like many men who did the same thing—who
promised to make the same hideous barter and
failed to perform their share of the bargain. He
did obtain my father’s freedom two days later.
And what do you think my father did with it
when he got it ? My mother told him her story—
how she had won his release. He listened without
a word ; and the following day he earned ten
shillings. With that money he bought a horse-
whip, and with that whip he flogged your father
in Phillip-street, in the very presence of the
Governor himself.
“Yes, he —the newly-emancipated convict—
flogged a powerful convict-official! Of course, to
such an act there could be only one sequel. They
took him to Charlotte Place, then and there, and
ordered him three hundred lashes; and from
Charlotte Place they dragged him to Barrack
Square forthwith to receive bis punishment.
They ordered out a new cat-o’-nine-tails—a new
“Slyde’s Improved”—but their care, that he
should suffer properly, was wasted. His head
drooped on his shoulders at the seventeenth
stroke ; he was unloosed j but he was dead.
“I never think of my father without feeling
proud of him for those two things—that he
thrashed your father and that he cheated the
bystem out of 283 lashes. God ! How angry
the authorities must have been when they were
robbed of their just dues ! Denham tells me that
your father was wild over the matter. ‘ I would
not have minded,’ he said, ‘if the beggar had
died at the 217th cut, but at the 17th !’ No
doubt it was preposterous conduct on any father’s
part, and for the offence he thus gave to your
father. I now, on behalf of my father, apologise
to your father’s son. It was ungrateful, deuced
ungrateful, of my progenitor, was it not to thus
annoy his benefactor ?” He had given utterance,
one would have suspected to a capital joke, he
infused so much heartiness into his laugh. He
was still indulging in his self-applausive merri-
ment when the door-bell rang suddenly.
Warphy, who had re-seated himself, started up.
The last revelation made by Jasker had driven
away his assumption of courage, and he was a
mere heap of clothes and shaking nerves when the
bell shocked him into a more violent tremor.
“What —what—is that?” he convulsively ejacu-
lated.
“It is a good thing I know you,” sweetly
answered Mr. Jasker, “otherwise I should have
thought you had an uneasy conscience. I have
forgotten I should have told you that a friend of
mine would call for me shortly at two o’clock,
if I failed to appear by that time at a certain'
spot.” Again, the bell rang, and Jasker sug-
gested that they should go to the door. “ Your
porter must be asleep, and you will not care to let
the whole house and your guests know of these
late callers.” Mechanically, as in a dream,
Warphy followed his tyrant.. The spacious man-
sion was hushed in repose, the last guest had long
since retired ; and a weary footman who had sat
up to receive the final commands of his master,
slept soundly in a chair at the foot of the stair-
case. Warphy stretched forth a limp hand to
rouse the servant, but on Jasker’s remark that he
would open the door, desisted. The latter flung
wide the stately door, and the hall-ligh*ts shone
upon two men standing in the verandah.
“ All right, then, Jasker,” said one of them.
“Yes —but come in, Denham. Come in, both
of you. You will forgive my asking my friends
in, Mr. Warphy? You know Denham, do you
not, Mr. Warphy ? And this other gentleman is
a de-tec —tive, Mr. Warphy. I thought it
better to prepare for emergencies, you know.
Men have gone into houses at midnight on more
agreeable errands than mine before now, and
never left them alive. Now, gentlemen all,
come!” He preceded them into the library.
That great man, Percy Warphy, drunk with terror,
had to be helped into the room by John Denham
and the officer of the Criminal Investigation De-
partment. When they had shuffled the poor
sinner into a seat, Jasker said to the detective :
‘‘Take a chair and wait outside, please.” The
man obeyed. The clock chimed three-quarters
past two.
Let me resume where I left off, W arr ,t „
said Jasker. “After my father’s death— t.
exact, I should say after his murder—my mr f? ° e
position was worse than before, for the inc’rt 8

senior, and I, saved you from many a piece of
bullying, for upon your head, even then, Warphy
were some of your father’s peccadiloes beinc
visited. I was sent to Oxford, and while I Wa i
there my mother—died.”
“She left me a great heritage in estates and
money; but that was small wealth to her other
legacy—a transcendant hate! You, Warphv
whom men think so clever, are a fool, for you ham
thought that in the accumulation of wealth was
to be found the greatest joy, the greatest good of
existence. Fool—fool, thrice over ! A mightv
emotion, a surprising love, a transcendent hate
will confer greater bliss than a monopoly of A
Broken Hill or a Bischoff. My mother ruined
your father, sent him to his grave a broken-
hearted and despised creature. But she was not
satisfied—she passed on her hate to me—and in a
letter which she left with her will and in which
she told me her story—bade me ruin you and
yours. lam here to-night to obey the command
Perhaps now yon will understand how it is I have
been so friendly to you, and why I have granted
you such extraordinary monetary facilities. My
friendliness was a trap—which has been eminently
successful!” The shattered wretch moaned.
# * *
“ You have not mentioned the condition
Jasker,” said John Denham.
“ I did so, but I do not think our friend—our
enemy here fully understood ! Did von
Warphy ? ” 3 ’
“No; no!” shrieked the badgered scoundrel,
and he thrust his hands out as if to avert the im-
pending wickedness.
“ I will restate it, then,” said Jasker, calmly.
“ Listen, for the last time ! The one condition on
which I will save you from those vultures of society
which, else, will to-morrow —no, this very day-
chant their Te Deuth Laudamus over your carcase
—is listen! —your daughter’s honour, your
daughter’s shame ! ”
“Blackguard! Fiend!” cried Warphy. Denham
chuckled. Jasker only smiled.
“You are addressing those epithets to the
memory of your father,” responded Jasker. “ But
why should you object ? Have you not, indeed,
already agreed that Freedom for Freedom, Honour
for Honour, is a fair bargain ? Your freedom for
my father’s, your daughter’s honour—or shame—
for my mother’s. What can be fairer? Besides,
Mr. Warphy ”•—he spoke with the gentle patience
which a man uses to persuade an irrational, pig-
headed person—“you who are a pillar of the
Church will appreciate this argument—the sugges-
tion has scriptural sanction. The Mosaic law, you
know ” ;_ M
“You mean—to marry her?” Warphy asked
piteously. He could not realise that Jasker had
made to him the most shameful proposition that
could fall from human lips.
“ Marry her ! ’’ laughed Jasker and Denham in
derisive unison. “ Marry her ! ” Jasker exclaimed,
“No ! ” And Denham said ; “ That would be a
curious way of visiting upon her head the sins of
her father, and upon your head, those of your
father! ”
The other scoundrel—the tormented and mad-
dened one —rose, and flung himself at Jasker. The
detective officer, hearing the scuffle, opened the
door, and came in. The creature that had once
been Percy Warphy fell back, cowed, impotently
furious, sobbing. Denham whispered to the man,
and he withdrew.
“ Then do I understand,” urbanely queried Mr.
Jasker, “that you refuse freedom and safety on
this one condition, Warphy?” The Thing ad-
dressed sat dumb. ’
“ Think, Warphy, a receipt in full, in exchange
for your daughter’s honour ! ”
“ Then, Warphy, I speak to you for the last
time—are you man enough to die ? At four
o’clock we will come back, and if we find you,
alive, then —the warrant, Warphy, the warrant! ”
They went out. On the landing the detective
joined them. The three passed noiselessly through
the hall; by the sleeping footman; out into the
dawning. When they returned an hour later from
watching the sun toss his beams from ridge to
peak, and from peak to pinnacle of the cloudy
Alps which lay piled in the East, they found that
the master of the house had been man enough, or
coward enough, to act on Jasker’s hint.
