HIS BOOKS
The Week's Best :—
A HUNTER OF
STRANGE
ANIMALS
It is a rash
attempt which
Grant Richards
makes in Author
Hunting. The
book is his
second effort in autobiography—the first
had to do with his misspent youth -and
his rashness is to
try to force into
this one volume
his experiences as
a London pub-
lisher from 1896
to 1925.
The result is a
violent sort of
c 1 u msiness, all
plain and under-
standable enough,
but as architec-
turally becoming
as a fowlhouse at
Bogan Gate.
That is not to call
it bad autobio-
graphy. Apart
Grant Richards.
from the rare trouble from which
he suffers, superabundance of material,
the book is as it is because such is the
character of the man. Publishing has
known some strange human novelties,
but this man, whom Shaw advised to
call his book “The Tragedy of a Pub-
lisher Who Fell in Love with Literature,”
has his own uniqueness.
His experience is wide and curious, of
a kind that makes his book a goldmine
for bibliophiles—such ore as this: “A
Shropshire Lad” was declined by Mac-
millan and only published by Kegan
Paul at the author’s expense ; 500 copies
were done, and it took two years to sell
them. Richards was the first to publish
Chesterton, and then only because the
work was forced on to him by a rival
publisher; and Richards subsequently
made no effort to retain Chesterton. He
published also John Masefield, but got
cold feet when Masefield offered him
“The Tragedy of Pompey the Great” ;
Heinemann then took up Masefield, and
made a fortune out of him. Leonard
Merrick wrote “The Actor-Manager” to
a plot supplied by Richards; and (to
rob him of one other item) Andrew
Lang’s landlady, asked by Richards if
Lang, an inveterate angler, caught many
fish, replied: “No, sir ;he never catches
anything, but he fishes beautifully.”
Engrossing stuff, too, about Shaw (and
a few score of his hitherto unpublished
letters), Dreiser, Samuel Butler, Arnold
Bennett, E. V. Lucas, H. G. Wells,
Ronald Firbank —of this last a piece of
extravagant-character projection that is
a model in that kind of writing.
A SHORT STORY
ONE NOVEL
LONG
That apparent
trouble of
Richards, of hav-
ing more ma-
terial than one
book might com-
fortably hold, certainly does not occur
in The Treasure of the Sierra Mad re,
the latest of B. Traven’s fictional curio-
sities to be translated. Nor does the
reading provoke that complaint littered
here a week ago on the machine-work
of the current translators. Turned into
English by Basil Creighton, it reads as if
it were native to this language, and with-
out obliteration of the original author.
The material is of the slightest. The
piece is a short story eked out to ndvei
length by the insertion of a dozen or so
stories slenderly related to the main one,
but it has entertaining qualities enough
to merit the attention of those who read
to no other end. It is strongly masculine,
muscular, robust; a gold-seeking adven-
ture story set in Mexico, as different and
far removed from the usual things of
the kind as a drover’s dog is from dog-
Latin. There is, in fact, something very
doggish about it. Like friend dog, the
author is very playful, leapful, genial.
He gambols and jumps about and makes
a notable spectacle of himself. Then
Circumstance, that wretched boy, ties a
tin to his tail, and he is off, an astonish-
ingly different animal. He bares his
fangs, he snarls, he throws off his
geniality, he springs on the figure of
Life and strips it to the bone.
It is a most unusual and interesting
fictional method; extraordinarily diffi-
cult to bring off, but natural to Traven.
He brought it off, quite as well, in an-
other book of his, translated last year,
“The Death-ship.” In that, as in this
later one, the reader progresses some
distance in the full and joyous belief
that the thing is a wildly inconsequential
comedy. A sentence, a phrase, a turn
of thought here and there might presage
stronger stuff ahead, but after each of
these omens the comedic note is struck
again immediately, to about half-way
through the book. Then, gradually,
change comes over the character of the
thing: imperceptibly the comedy dimin-
ishes, the drama emerges. By the end
it has moved into stark drama, none the
less ferocious for being, amazingly,
couched in the exact vocabulary that
earlier was so quick with laughs.
The theme is as old as any: the in-
sidious and disintegrating effect of gold
on human character.
“The Death-ship” was an unholy flop
on the Australian market. Is it that we
are sensitive to a personal application of
the art we take some considerable pride
in, leg-pulling? Something of the kind
might account for the hegiect of a
writer who, though far from great, Is
an original ; an authentic humorist who
also knows life very much in the raw.
Possibly he has lived it: at any rate he
gives the impression of having travelled
the odder places of the world In the
quaint vagabondage that is the staple of
his characterisation, HU humor Is of too
floating a kind to be Well demonstrated
by example, but one definition, “Sing
Sing is the residence of all New Yorkers
who get Caught,” may hint at it-.
CHISHOLM
AMONG THE!
BIRDIES
Like the book
bf Merrick’s that
has been men-
iioned; A. H.
Chisholm’s latest
tribute to his
feathered cobbers, Bird Wonders of A us-
tralicl, was done to the publishers’ order.
That matters nothing: most of its chap-
ters had been written at intervals over
the last year or two ; and, anyway, there
is a leafy lyricism to Chisholm’s manner
of thinking that would somehow win
through: a writer who has style in the
soundest sense, that his writing bears the
impress of character.
His work, here and elsewhere, is not
only engaging on its own account—--
"Orp’s Little Joke,” an Orpen view of
Arnold Bennett in “Author Hunting.”
writing sufficiently pleasing to make good
reading, whether the reader had ever
consciously looked at a bird or not—it
has importance as part of the scattered
literary utterance that is forcing up the
tradition of writing in Australia. Chis-
holm’s contribution is in giving us full
familiarity with those natural surround-

Abnormality
of Artists
The Hollywood
outlook on life
crops up at sun-
dry times and in
unsuspected
places. An ex-
cellent example is Quentin Pope’s en-
gaging essay, “Lobsters on Silver Chains”
(R.P. 26/9/’34).
Mr. Pope has conned the records of
the artists and discovers that they have
done many things and said or written
many things which have staggered their
contemporaries. He attributes this to
the exhibitionist tendencies of man, the
desire for display, which are never more
obvious, according to him, than in the
artist.
Inherent in this is the popular fiction
that it is the artist who is abnormal, and
the norm of good behavior is the average
man. The youthful Reynolds, accord-
ing to Mr. Pope, made a grand display
of his importance in order to boost the
value of his portraits. There is nothing
abnormal about this. He wanted to
sell them, and he wanted to sell them iri
order to acquire money, and he wanted
to acquire money in order to attain to
power, and the desire for power is a per-
fectly normal attribute. If Reynolds had
painted bad portraits to achieve the same
result he would have been doing what all
his fellow-painters were doing ; but he
didn’t, and that is all that matters.
Mr. Pope is also shocked because
Wilde wore sunflowers and velvet

knickers and polished his epigrams. The
“normal” man certainly doesn’t polish
his epigrams, and he doesn’t wear sun-
flowers and velvet knickers unless they
happen to be in the fashion, when he
wears them with a good conscience ; and
he will wear the most appalling fashions,
such as plus-fours, if they happen to be
respectable. When they are not respect-
able he thinks them shocking, and he
thinks even beautiful clothes are shocking
if everybody isn’t wearing them. Wilde
probably wore his unusual clothes as
much because he thought them pretty as
because they provided him with a good
advertisement. Shaw shocked his con-
temporaries by pointing out in “Mrs.
Warren’s Profession” that if we require
conventional morality then we also re-
quire prostitution ; and the statement
automatically provided him with a better
advertisement than if he had walked
down the Strand in the altogether.
If Mr. Pope wants to learn who are
the normal people and who the abnor-
mal he should read Samuel Butler’s “The
Way of All Flesh.” Butler’s father and
mother, his grandfather and his school-
master all thought they were excessively
normal people, and that the youthful
Samuel was a very bad, if not perverted,
boy who required daily floggings to keep
him in the path of virtue. It now appears
that it was Samuel who had all the sense
and his pastors and masters all the non-
sense ; in short, that, by any decent
human criterion, they were comic char-
acters, like Shaw’s fellow-Britons.
When I was a boy in Adelaide I was
told that a certain solicitor who wrote
poetry and made frequent unusual ap-
pearances in public was a very shock-
ing person. Periodically he drove to his
office in a four-in-hand, wearing a bril-
liant hunting costume. The outfit looked
very pretty, and might even have ap-
peared to me magnificent; it was quite
as sensible a way of getting to an office
as riding in a horse-tram dressed in a
serge suit badly in need of dry-cleaning ;
but I was told that, as no other solicitor
did that sort of thing, I ought to be
shocked at the spectacle, and, naturally,
not knowing any better, I was shocked.
In fact, I grew up under the belief that
this particular solicitor was a dangerous
person, although he had such a brilliant
mind that when they put him in an
asylum he frightened the governor into
letting him out on a legal technicality.
When I reached maturer years I had my
first opportunity of meeting him per-
sonally, my family having invited him to
a literary evening. We were all very
tremulous about it, as we didn’t know
what might happen. All that happened
was that he delivered an instructive ad-
dress on the poetry of Matthew Arnold,
and afterwards regaled us with the most
informing conversation that up to then
I had ever had the privilege of listening
to in Adelaide, where informing conver-
sation is not regarded as quite respect-
able.
I think that if Mr. Pope will continue
his researches into the ways of artists
he will find their normalness far out-
weighs their abnormalities. Some of
them, unfortunately, have gone mad part
of their time owing to the pressure of the
“normal” people, but as “normal” people
are more or less mad all the time this
still leaves a large balance in favor of
the artists.
M. G. SKIPPER.
Writers
Fellowships
All writers’ fel-
-lows h i p s and
literary societies
are not as futile,
or their members
such literary
nonentities, as Cecil Mann would have
us believe (R.P. 26/9/’34). There are
some exceptions, a notable one being the
Aus. National Literary and Musical Pro-
gress Association, the most unwieldy
part of which is its name.
This organisation has branches in most
Australian capitals and major towns, and
also in Maoriland, and its official organ,
the “Australian Composer and Writers’
Monthly,” circulates practically through-
out the Commonwealth and the
Dominion. The society numbers among
its members such notable writers as
Dulcie Deamer (Bulletin and “Lone
Hand” discovery of some years ago),
Henry B. Raine, Jack Hemming, C. and
M. Cottrell and many others. In addi-
tion to literature, it caters for music, art,
the drama and scenario writing and film
production.
Few, either veteran or novice, will chal-
lenge the statement that writing is done
“single, solo, alone or not at all,” and
necessitates “work, loneliness and indi-
vidualism” ; but it must be borne in mind
that all practitioners, whether they belong
to the faculty of medicine or are engaged
in the propagation of pumpkins, meet
together occasionally to discuss the best
means of fostering and improving the
calling they represent. And so it is with
the writers. They need not devote their
evenings to “listening to the platitudes
of the latest precious novelist” or the
effusions of the “most unread lady poet” ;
they would be better employed trying to
devise ways and means of coping with
the Yankee octopus that has spread its
tentacles over the fields of literature,
music and film production in this coun-
try. Personally, I would like to see a
big congress of all the literary and allied
societies, whose representatives could dis-
cuss this and other questions vital to the
future of our Australian writers.
THOS V. TIERNEY.
A Frank
Statement,
Without Words
That frank,
1o g ical, artistic
statement the
Memorial in
Hyde Park, Syd-
ney, is virtually
completed, soon to be officially dedi-
cated by the Duke of Gloucester.
It will be given over as a statement
without words, and in the long run it
might be better if it stayed so. Unlike
a literary masterpiece, which can be
rendered null only by deletion, it can be
spoilt by addition.
It stands, briefly, as a symbol of sacri-
fice. It is a memorial to the dead, and
an epitaph upon them, but it is a glori-
fication of nothing but their sacrifice.
War is not honored by it, nor are sol-
diers. It makes no concession to senti-
mentalism. It is a tribute, set in beauty,
to those men who were sacrificed to war.
Not any war, nor any men ; but the men
of this country in this time who were
so sacrificed.
If that is not what it stands for, it
stands for nothing. If that is not the
meaning, then a few yards of chiffon
should be wound round the middle of
Rayner Hoff’s bronze symbol and a
crimson-splashed bandage about the
head. The country roadsides should be
scoured for a surround of suitably deri-
sive guns. The lake in front should be
made busy with working models of war-
ships. The structure should be ducoed
and sprinkled with steel shrapnel. But-
ton Day girls, or, perhaps, decoratively
preferable, their daughters, should do fan
dances with white feathers and make a
chorus out of judicious extracts from the
works of Sir Henry Newbolt and Mr.
Rudyard Kipling. ' Overlooking all,
colossal at the apex, there should be the
figure of nothing less than a major-
general.
Then, as the thing would stand for
nothing, these various spaces that have
been left for words could be filled in, as
they run an imminent risk of being filled
in, with words suitable to the high pur-
poses of Bumble and Bowdler.
Or turn the figure round, and approach
it from this side: With the memorial
as it stands now, fill in those spaces with
words, however fine, that mock or deny
the particular spirit that pervades it!
Those words might be chosen from the
classics: they probably will be: Bumble
has ever venerated that great Institute of
No Art, the University, and will surely
turn thither for his guidance. As surely
will he be gravelled by the portentous
voice of Pindar, some few score genera-
tions removed. Or, if you have no mind,
gentlemen, for the precedent of Prince
George, there is the English literature.
We, of course, rather pride ourselves on
that, gentlemen. Say, a few nice lengths
from the Oxford Book of English Verse.
Thank you, gentlemen ; leave it to our
discretion. Send your mason up on
Monday.
That, probably, almost certainly, is
how it will be done. There will be no
lack of applause. Every pedant and
every pedant’s fool in the community
will choir it; and if Dellit, the designer,
and Hoff, the sculptor, are not found at
the foot of the Gap it will probably be
only because the sharks had got there
before the police.
For, of course, the courage and the
artistic integrity of these men are un-
questionable: and, the fools that they
are, they have left spaces for words.
Words, inevitably, will go into those
spaces. By some miracle the right words
may go into them. That is what these
fools rely on, a miracle. If it be vouch-
safed them, there will be words that bind
and unify the details of their symbolical
variations on the theme of War Sacrifice.
If there be a miracle.
Those words will not be pretty. Nor
will they be conjured up out of the clas-
sics. They will be formed now. They
will be plangent and alive. They will
speak in the voice of the wordless state-
ment that has been left for them to unify
and to make articulate.
Who will form them, how they will
be got, is surely not an urgent matter.
The memorial could well do without
them altogether ; certainly it could stand
for years without them. Then it should
of its own force inspire them. It is an
inspiriting thing. They must be formed
at its inspiration, or, at least, at the in-
spiration which moved the memorial’s
makers. That was not found at the
Pantheon, nor in the buildings after the
Fire of London. It is of Now, To-day.
It is an inspiration of this time, and
words can leap as high, surely, to the
same tune.
But even if such an unlikely aspira-
tion should move the trustees over this
memorial, that they should seek here in
Australia now the poet or the poets who
might bind and unite these statements of
mute art with the fire of words, it would
still be left to the committee to arrange
the choosing. If they are to give this
into the hands of pedants, they might
as well employ the loudest poetaster in
the land and let him do the job at those
space rates he loves better than his art.
For a poetaster would certainly do it:
these are the very proteges of Pedantry.
The choice must be that of artists. It
is art that is desired, and not erudition.
As ope who has looked into this thing
of beauty which the trustees have had
the courage to father, and which they
will presently give over to the people, I
would suggest, in all urgency, to those
trustees that they should shake Australia,
the whole of it, without haste, for the
words this memorial may need and does
certainly deserve, and that, for the mak-
ing of a choice of those words, they
should set up nothing other than a com-
petent body of literary artists. Purely as
an indication, I would propose the names
of Kenneth Slessor, Brian Penton, Leon
Gellert. Some such group as that.

This book is most
interesting for its
history, at the end, of the formation
of the “Transatlantic Review” in Paris
in 1923 ; there are excellent pictures of
the artistic life of those hysterical times ;
Ezra Pound, mumbling to himself,
almost walks out of the pages; Ernest
Hemingway shadow-boxes; there is a
story of a meeting between James Joyce
and Proust that is almost worth the
book. Ford seems to have known every
worth-while English writer, and he has
stories about them which do not need to
be true, they are so illuminating.
New Zealand from Tasman to Massey,
by N. E. Coad (Harry H. Tombs, Welling-
ton ; 6s. 6d.), is the best history of Maori-
land yet published. Much more com-
plete than the somewhat sketchy reviews
of Condliffe and Schofield (which, how-
ever, weren’t intended as histories), it
exhibits a freedom from political bias
entirely lacking in the work of Alfred
Saunders. Vogel, who in the eyes of
Saunders was horned and hoofed, is given
his rightful niche as a far-seeing planner
whose soundest proposals were rejected ;
Grey, Seddon, Ward and Massey are all
fairly assessed. Miss Coad hasn’t got all
her material from the files; she writes
into her record the things all intelligent
Maorilanders of middle-age know about
the events and personalities of the last
half-century, and her comments are as
shrewd as they are kindly.
P. C. Wren deserts his Foreign Legion
in Beggars’ Horses (Murray; 7s. 6d. ;
per Robertson and Mullens) and pro-
duces an Indian yogi who, in return for
an insult, bitterly predicts to six Indian
Army officers that each of them shall
have his dearest wish fulfilled. Their
desires are long life, great strength,
wealth, happiness, courage and health,
and the working-out of the prophecy
brings satisfaction to few and appalling
misery to some. Wren makes of it an
intense and stirring tale.

REDS ON THE RAMPAGE.
Transport is the bloodstream of modern
life. Stop its flow, and there is general
paralysis. Communists know this ; hence
their unceasing efforts to get control of
transport unions and those which work
in fuel and metals. They have made
some headway, and are mischievous
always, but are dangerous only when
there is widespread discontent.
For one thing, they have succeeded
in drafting the Australian Railwaymen’s
Union into the Red International of
Labor Unions. The general president of
the A.R.U., Mr. Chapman, was a Mos-
cow pilgrim. He arrived in Australia in
1924. Within a few weeks the Federal
executive of the union became scandal-
ised at the manner in which the affairs
of the N. S. Wales branch had been
conducted. A “political,” Mr. Buckley,
was secretary of the branch; he was
ousted, and Mr. Chapman was installed.
Mr. Chapman soon began proselytising
for the R.I.L.U.
Every year some A.R.U. representa-
tive goes to Moscow. The rank and file
have small interest in Russia; but,
nursing grievances as they do, the chief
being that wages have fallen to a greater
extent than the cost of living, they are
naturally attracted by a programme which
promises them a minimum wage of £5
16s. for a 30-hour week. In Communist
textbooks on tactics it is brazenly ad-
mitted that this is merely an “inter-
mediate” programme to “attract reform-
its support” ; the real design is to “inten-
sify the preparation of the working class
for the impending and decisive revolu-
tionary battles.”
The 1932 pilgrims to Moscow had a
pleasant chat with M. Losovsky, general
secretary of the Red International
Bureau. M. Losovsky was delighted
to find that the Dominions were more
“active” than Britain. He told the visit-
ing comrades that they could cure their
troubles by taking moderate trade-union
leaders and throwing them out “by the
scruff of the neck” ; “you want to have
revolutionary proletarians occupying the
union posts.” Comrade Mullins seems
to have agreed. He is reported as having
said:
I consider we must form organisations
of revolutionary workers from below on
the basis of the position of the R.I.L.U.
We have to carry on our work by under-
ground means. And, nevertheless, I must
say that the influence of revolutionary
workers’ organisations is growing in. all
corners of the land We may say with
confidence that we will succeed in the
near future in developing a big strike move-
ment for an improvement in our conditions.
Comrade Gray—also an Australian, it
seems, though not a railwayman—sup-
plemented this with:
We have to carry on a struggle against
armed police, and in order to fight against
it we must also be armed.
Comrade Anderson, of the Queensland
A.R.U., explained that the delegation had
been sent to Russia to seek a way out of
Australia’s troubles. Comrade Losovsky
said:
We will have the opportunity of ex-
changing views with our Australian com-
rades on the question of the Railway-
men’s Union joining the R.I.L.U. We will
acquaint our Australian comrades with
our decisions and our estimates of the
Australian trade-union movepient.
The details of that discussion were not
published, but the A.R.U. has since be-
come a Red propaganda bureau. Its
Queensland official journal, the “Advo-
cate,” advised its readers to vote Com-
munist at the last Commonwealth elec-
tion. In the name of the union it has
been asserted that “in recent strikes the
only force which came out in defence of
the workers’ interest and against the em-
ployers was the revolutionary trade-
union movement and the Communist
party.” The N. S. Wales branch news-
paper is devoted mainly to Communist
subjects and the interests of various
“anti-imperialist” and anti-Australian
movements.
Nor have the Government and muni-
cipal tramways been neglected. Mem-
bers of the Tramwaymen’s Union have
been plied for years with Communist
propaganda, and no branch is without
its Communist “nucleus” or “cell.” For
the most part, executive positions remain
in the hands of moderates; but where
discontent exists and mass meetings are
called moderates invariably surrender to
extremists. This was the case in Mel-
bourne last week, with the result that
the people of the great city about to
celebrate its centenary and to welcome
the King’s son found themselves with
a tramway strike on their hands.
Tramwaymen are good fellows, as a
rule, and the Melbourne men are among
the most decent and competent of their
kind. Hundreds of them are returned
soldiers. It is deplorable that they should
have plunged into a strike so alien in
origin, unpatriotic and anti-social, and so
absolutely certain to be lost; but it shows
what a cunning minority, exploiting
grievances, loyalty to the union and mass
psychology, can do.
There will be other and worse trans-
port strikes if Governments are not care-
ful. In their thickheaded way they have
been helping the Communists by trying
to drive private motor-’bus and -lorry
services off the roads. This fool-policy
will have to be dropped ; it is clear from
Melbourne’s experience that this com-
petition is necessary for the protection,
as well as the convenience, of the public,
though it should, of course, be regu-
lated and taxed.
For the rest, functionaries like the
N. S. Wales Commissioner of Railways
should be forbidden to grant pay-in-
creases in which the rank and file do
not share. An anti-Red organisation of
railwaymen has been registered, the
National Union. It recently protested to
the Minister of Transport that “in view
of the low-wage conditions in the ser-
vice the increases granted to highly-paid
officials, as from September 1, are un-
warranted and unjust,” and quoted the
following:
The Secretary for Railways, the Chief
Civil Engineer and the Chief Traffic Man-
ager—£26 14s. 7d. a week, increased
by £3 19s. 2d.;. the Chief Mechani-
cal Engineer, £26 a week, increased by £3 ;
the Comptroller of Stores, £23, increased
by £4; the Comptroller of Accounts, in-
creased from £25 to £29; the Signal Engin-
eer, £2O to £22; the Chief Electrical Engin-
eer, £2B 14s. 7d. to £3O; the Chief Medi-
cal Officer, £22 to £24; the Estate Agent,
£2O to £22.
The union might have mentioned that
the Commissioner’s own salary has been
raised from £4365 to £5OOO, “less de-
ductions under the Public Service Salaries
Act” (reduced from £6186 to £5065 this
year in respect of the 60-odd people
in his office), and that on his own show-
ing, with relief tax deducted, engine-
drivers have been getting £4 Bs. 7d. a
week, stationmasters £4 ss. 6d., guards
£3 17s. 6d. and signalmen £3 Bs. Id.;
but here is the Minister’s reply:
I am not aware that any action such as
you refer to has been taken but as
these are purely matters of internal ad-
ministration under the jurisdiction of the
Commissioner, it is the policy of the
Government to leave them entirely in his
hands.
This when the railways are admittedly
losing upwards of three millions a year,
which means that every pound added to
a brass-hat’s salary has to be found by
the taxpayer. The Minister’s attitude is
insolent and provocative. If his Govern-
ment had any regard for the “equality
of sacrifice” of which so much has been
said, it would veto all such increases
until the management can find them out
of revenue. It pleads that it is not respon-
sible for “the low-wage conditions in the
service,” but it is responsible for the ar-
rangement which compels its railwaymen
and tramwaymen, along with other work-
ers, to pay fancy prices for at least one
necessary commodity. It can, and should,
put an end to the unspeakable creation of
famine in the midst of plenty which
results in sevenpence and eightpence a
quart being charged for milk when five-
pence would be a fair price—and it was
the price before milk was “controlled.”
And the Commonwealth Government
might well lighten the burden of the taxes
—particularly sales tax and revenue
duties of customs and excise—which are
inflating the cost of other necessaries.
Every time a man drinks a pint of beer
after a hard day’s work he pays the Gov-
ernment threepence. A small matter, per-
haps, but it helps to breed discontent,
and discontent is what Communists
trade on. In Australia their Oriental
variety of socialism could never thrive
without it.
THE DICTATOR-DEMOCRAT.
“If the ghost of Julius Caesar was hovering
around and witnessed the recent Federal elec-
tion he probably said to himself, ‘This Aus-
tralian democracy is a democracy after my
own heart, and one I wished to establish on
earth two thousand years ago.’ ”
—*■.Newspaper correspondent.
The aim of every tyrant in communities
with electoral systems is to be mistaken
for a friend of the poor. The propa-
gandists in the service of the Boss put
him forward as a sentimental humani-
tarian whose thoughts are all of “his
people” ; and even when he is cruel it
is explained that his basic intention was
to be kind.
Julius Caesar, the model and inspira-
tion for a thousand political adventurers,
was that kind of democrat. He never aimed
at establishing a democracy ; it is doubt-
ful whether he aimed at establishing any-
thing except himself. All his life he was
an opportunist and improvisor, in which
respects he is resembled by Mussolini,
who, as his opponents tend to subside,
tends to revive that liberty which he for-
merly said was dead; by Stalin, who,
beginning as a Marxian internationalist,
has developed into an advocate of capi-
talism, imperialism and militarism ; and
even by J. T. Lang, whose “Plans” vary
from year to year.
Caesar’s career should be studied by
every intelligent Australian. Partly be-
cause it is being used as an argument in
favor of government by a “superman,”
“Fiihrer,” “II Duce” or whatever the
local nickname may be, and partly be-
cause the age Caesar lived in was, with
one exception, remarkably like our own.
The difference lay chiefly in the fact that
in Caesar’s day war paid. He might never
have become a general if he hadn’t been
bankrupt. Crassus, Sulla, Lucullus, Pom-
pey and others had made vast fortunes
by looting Asiatic countries ; Caesar put
his affairs in order, and was enabled to
embark on a gigantic system of political
corruption, by pillaging Gaul. Every-
body in Italy benefited, directly or in-
directly, from the loot brought to Rome
by victorious armies ; but the ultimate
effect was to produce a depression. Ger-
many had a similar experience when
the French suddenly paid the whole of
the Franco-Prussian War indemnity.
Prices rose, and the poor suffered ; stand-
ards of living rose, and the middle-classes
got into debt.
The democratic party to which Caesar
belonged was the equivalent of a
modern Labor party. Its domestic
policy was founded on hatred of
the rich. Catiline’s plan, which had
had the support of Caesar, resembled a
Lang plan; novce tabulae and debt-
repudiation were the same. Abolition of
debt was the one major policy to which
Caesar clung—however unwillingly at
times—from the beginning of his public
career till his death. He couldn’t repu-
diate it even after he had become dic-
tator and a capitalist: it was the sole
device by which the bankrupt aristocrats
and harassed farmers and others who had
stood by him could hope to save them-
selves.
The most dangerous of the many
fallacies promulgated by our modern
Caesar-worshippers, Napoleon-worship-
pers and Cromwell-worshippers is that
these usurpers of power were true
democrats; that they knew what they
meant to give the people, and that it
was something the people desired. Caesar
had done nothing for the people by the
time he was killed; Napoleon’s fall was
a relief to France; Cromwell’s regime
caused a dislike of non-Parliamentary
government and standing armies which
persists in England to this day. The
careers of Stalin, Mussolini and Hitler
are also pointed to as proof of the virtues
of one-man control. These, it is said or
suggested, are the true democrats of
modern times, and if British communi-
ties don’t drop their old-fashioned ways
and go in for Oswald Mosleyism, Jack
Langism or what not it will be the worse
for them.
The answer to such rubbish is to be
found in universal history. The tyrant
or boss never delivers the promised
goods; it is not in his power to
deliver them. At the best (like Musso-
lini or Cromwell) he keeps order, as in
a Parliament-governed country; at the
worst he becomes intolerable to power-
ful sections (like Caesar) or to.the whole
world (like Napoleon), and is destroyed.
Sometimes when a dictator disappears the
country in which he has stifled freedom
of speech, of politics, perhaps even of
religion, is given the chance to choose
his successor. A true democracy never
declares for another dictator but turns
enthusiastically to some form of consti-
tutional government.
STUDY OF A NATIONALIST.
If Poincare had died five years ago, when
the disease that killed him last week first
made its appearance, he would have been
mourned as perhaps the greatest man
in the world. He had a phenomenal
brain and will, but he was one of those
men whom people prefer to forget.
Though he possessed all the virtues —he
was a non-drinker and non-smoker, and
his domestic life was stainless —it is not
too much to say that outside his family
circle nobody liked him.
In the Deputies he was as hard and
cold as an icicle, as pugnacious as a
bulldog-ant, as efficient as a machine.
Many stories were told of his prodigious
memory for facts and figures—particu-
larly figures. The French revered him
for his intellect and his dogged courage,
and they were accustomed for years to
turn to him in every crisis.
I was in France in the summer of
1926 when the franc was threatening to
go the way of the mark. It had fallen
to a penny relatively to the pound ster-
ling and the dollar, and the Minister for
Finance had announced in Parliament
that his Government had only £250,000
left to its credit in the Bank of France.
The French did not greet inflation with
the enthusiasm of some of our amateur
financiers in Australia: they were terri-
fied of it. In these circumstances Poin-
care was given dictatorial powers, and
he began his “Save the Franc” campaign.
I often saw him in the 20 months that
intervened between the beginning of the
inflation and the stabilisation of the franc
at a fifth of its old value ; and as an
Australian I actually had a six-minute
interview with him in the huge Louis
XV. room of the Finance Ministry which
he occupied at the Louvre during 1927.
So far as this small, stocky, big-headed,
gimlet-eyed automaton could be enthusi-
astic about anything, he seemed to be
enthusiastic about the Australian infan-
try ; he said they were “loyal.”
At this time he was 66. He had
formed a Government containing five
members who had previously led French
Governments. The French had got out
of the habit of paying income tax ;he
put an end to this in a night, and im-
posed 11,000 million francs of extra taxa-
tion. The inflation had caused prices to
skyrocket, yet he brought wages down
from 20 to 30 per cent. Simultaneously
he took drastic and effective action
against gamblers in valuta—the jackal
financiers who always appear when a
national currency is in danger. The pri-
vate banks made voluntary loans to the
Government, and the money was used
by the Bank of France to buy gold, the
banks being repaid as the taxes began to
be collected. France was saved from
bankruptcy, and Poincare presently went
back to private life and to the first of
the series of operations which ended in
his death.
Between the autumn of 1926 and the
end of 1927, the eyes of the entire world
were focussed on this strange being, yet
he didn’t seem interested. He arrived
at his office by the Metro every morning
early, and walked from the station (and
back to it at night), an undistinguished
little grey-bearded figure in a bowler
hat and tailcoat. He shunned advertise-
ment and scorned money. Before enter-
ing Parliament he had been the lawyer
of France’s wealthiest coal and iron
firms, and he could have retained that
lucrative job and made fortunes in other
directions had he been willing to leave
politics alone. As it is, he has died poor
as well as half-forgotten.
But he was President throughout the
war (“Poincare la Guerre” they called
him); he made up his differences with
his ancient enemy Clemenceau so that
the war might be won ; and when the
Germans tried to dodge their obligations
after the war he seized the Ruhr. Not
a likeable man, not a kind man, not even,
according to some standards, a good
man. But what a man for a country to
have in its hour of trouble this side of
the internationalist millennium! So
long as nationalism exists, such men must
be the chief standby of nations.

PLAIN ENGLISH.
Aerial Lessons.
The aerial events of the week have their
lessons. The England-Australia race
shows the sort of competition the
gallant Australians Parer, Woods and
Melrose had to face with their made-over
and obsolescent craft. It also illustrates
how far a process to which the world
has become accustomed on the roads is
going on in the air.
England builds better racing ’planes
than the U.S.A., but not better practical
transport machines. Scott, a superb flier
with the best racing job Britain can
build and an estimated flying time for
the Mildenhall-Melbourne route of
67hr. 21 min., flew a fairly equal race to
Singapore, allowing for the differences
in routes and number of stops, with
the Douglas machine, a large standard
passenger ’plane of the type in use on the
trans-U.S.A. mail routes. The Bulletin
has several times contrasted Douglas per-
formances with those of the passenger
machines which Senator Pearce and his
fellow-tortoises have authorised for the
London-Australia air mail.
The Dutch mail machine carried four
passengers and 35,000 letters. Its pilot told
an interviewer that he found the trip no
more exciting than his ordinary run from
Amsterdam to Batavia, and he flew the
6300 miles to Rangoon—which will
take approximately seven days under the
Australia-London schedule —in 40| hours,
with six stops. Including stops, he aver-
aged 154 m.p.h.; without stops, nearly
200 m.p.h—normal cruising speed. The
cruising speed of the Australian liners
will be about 140 m.p.h. Scott’s time to
Singapore was 40 hours, with three short
stops.
The next lesson is more disturbing.
One of the most mQdern, long-range,
four-engined passenger liners in the world,
bound from Hobart to Melbourne, dis-
appeared over Bass Strait —the second
serious aerial accident in Australia in a
month. Two pilots and ten passengers—
six men, three women and a child, in-
cluding the Rev. H. Warren, a pioneer
of motoring outback irt Northern Terri-
tory—are missing. A tragic affair and
almost inconceivable, provided the
machine had gliding height or there
was time to get the petrol out of the
tanks. It could fly on two engines.
The Civil Aviation Department’s
officer in charge of the search and a
pilot who has actually flown the Miss
Hobart, as the air-liner was called, are
reported to have suggested that the pilots
might have accidentally touched the con-
trols while changing over. This has yet
to be proved, but it raises doubts which
will have to be dispelled. Attention has
already been called to the risk arising
from the presence of unguarded throw-
up switches in ’planes which could be
made safe with a penny metal guard.

What Do These Experts Know?
Melbourne’s centenary has stirred up
once more the smouldering fire on the
Russell-street front. Police Chief Blarney
issued a scheme for controlling traffic
during the celebrations: not regulations
in any sense ; merely directions for the
guidance of vehicle drivers. Blarney’s
sensible action brought the City Council
to its feet, breathing fire and demanding
to know what right a mere police official
had to interfere in the regulation of
traffic which it was his duty to regulate.
Bumble contends that it has the right to
decide how traffic shall go ; the police,
whose daily duty it is to watch and con-
trol traffic, know nothing whatever
about it.
Retired greengrocers and superannu-
ated agents who become councillors
deem themselves far better judges of
where and when a motor-car should stop
than men whose job it is to care for the
safety of the public. As for the police,
theirs not to reason why but merely to
carry out what they are told by Bumble.
The professional, in fact, should defer
to the amateur, and an amateur who is
only a pro tem. claimant to infallibility
at best.
It is only a year since the police, after
long observation and exhaustive tests, re-
ported in favor of diagonal parking of
cars. Bumble had different ideas. He
told Blarney to mind his own business,
and ordered the cars to be placed length-
wise as before, so that to-day the motor-
ist who leaves a parked car often has
to wait an hour for the owners of the
cars in front of him and behind him to
turn up and let him escape.
It is up to the State Parliament to take
a hand and' so define things that the
people who know most about the matter
will be entrusted to see it through.
“Strike Me Lucky.”
Not a single Government member could
be found last week to vote that a Select
Committee should investigate the rejec-
tion of the plans for a £250,000 Sydney
picture theatre by the Chief Secretary’s
Department.
“I suggest,” said the Premier, “that the
appointment of a Select Committee is
unnecessary, and that the appointment
of an independent board to review the
action of the Minister is also unneces-
sary” ; and every Ministerialist agreed.
Yet representative architects have
championed the rejected plans, and
others have protested against great
building enterprises being subject to a
one-man veto. And it is a fact that
features objected to in Mr. Dellit’s plans
have been permitted in existing theatres.
Mr. Stuart Doyle’s State Theatre has
covered courts, which are cavilled at in
the Dellit building. It has 72 seats in
one row, whereas the regulations say that
no row shall exceed 14 seats.
Said Mr. Stevens:
If this building had gone up Mr. Dellit
would have received as an ordinary archi-
tect’s fee about £15,000.
This is very paltry. After all, the
State and Commonwealth Governments
would get at least half. But let the Pre-
mier continue:
The plans show that there is not one
other theatre in the city with the demerits
of this proposed one from the point of view
of public safety.
What about the Town Hall? When
exhibitions are held there and temporary
electric mains run all over it, some of
the exit doors are locked and bolted.
“Men before Money!” shouted Mr. Lang
amidst the boisterous laughter of the
U.A.P. “Safety before Earnings,” says
Mr. Stevens, who in some things has a
deplorable tendency to copy his predeces-
sor.
Incidentally, some of the Government
’buses exhibit notices about the number
of passengers that may be carried. Every
evening they are jambed full in mock-
ery of the notices. Some have two exits,
and at certain hours the Transport Depart-
ment closes one of them to save a con-
ductor’s wages. And on the Government
trams, according to union figures, there
have been 5000 accidents to employees
in five years, chiefly because men are
compelled to work on the deadly foot-
board. No “Safety before Earnings”
there.
It is confidently expected that the ban-
ning of the plans for this theatre will be
followed by the dropping of the proposal
for a film quota. Mr. Stuart Doyle is
against both, and Mr. Stuart Doyle’s luck
is stupendous.
Three days after the Assembly debate
“the extended studio of Cinesound,” a
Stuart Doyle enterprise, was “formally
opened by Mr. Stevens,” who heard Mr.
Stuart Doyle coolly propose “a bonus of
ss. for every pound spent on worthy
story-telling films sent out of Australia,
aggregating, say, £50,000 a year.” He
was photographed with Mr. Stuart Doyle,
and afterwards saw a film which Mr.
Stuart Doyle has sponsored. Its appro-
priate title is “Strike Me Lucky.”

“Billy.”
“D.” on a phenomenon:
Nobody has become a Cabinet Minister in
face of so many disabilities as W. M. Hughes.
He has at different times alienated every big
voting section in the Commonwealth.
He earned the distrust of Protectionists as a
Freetrade Laborite before the war, and of
Freetraders as a Protectionist Nationalist after-
wards. He did as much as any one man to
wish Canberra on to Australia. He was a
war-time Prime Minister —in itself a heavy
handicap —and he used the War Precautions
Act tyrannically. Further, he hung on to it
for years after the Armistice, thereby scandal-
ising liberty-lovers; and when he was forced
to drop it he passed a W. P. Act Amendment
Act which was presently found to be little
different in essentials from the original Act.
Hughes has fought every party machine he
has been associated with, and he has said
lacerating things about old colleagues, Labor
and anti-Labor. The stronger a supposed enemy
seemed to be at a given time, the more
strongly he attacked him. During the whole
of his public career he has been deaf, physi-
cally frail and dyspeptic; and he is now
over 70.
On the credit side, he has been consistently
patriotic—first as an Australian, next as a
Briton; and he has never flag-wagged, either
in the J. T. Lang manner or in the equally
fulsome British Empire League style. He
advocated Australian defence when it was un-
fashionable with all parties in N. S. Wales,
and he is still advocating it when pacifist
propaganda has made it bad political business
once more. He is a first-class platform speaker,
and his oratorical manner expresses to a re-
markable degree the fighting spirit which has
impelled him to join foredoomed movements. He
has never hesitated to risk the party nomination
and his political career, whether as a point of
principle or pique; and the electors like him
for it. He has no digestion, but he certainly
has “guts.”
He has met all the important people of his
time, and he has never let himself be overawed
or diverted from his purpose by any of them.
In this respect he is almost unique among
Empire politicians, and Australians don’t forget
it. He may have been dictatorial, bad-man-
nered, even boorish to individuals in the days
of his power; but he was never a snob. He
has a ribald sense of humor, and he has always
been able to laugh at himself. His mind is
young, and he has an eager young man’s in-
capacity to acknowledge the possibility of de-
feat. I think the last is the chief reason why
he is starting on a fresh career when, by all
the laws of nature, he ought to be dead.

The Spanner in Ingenuity.
A case now being heard in the Victorian
courts directs attention to a glaring defect
in the Australian patents law, though the
thing has no bearing on the issue of the
action.
During the first years of the Com-
monwealth, an amended Patents Bill was
introduced. It was largely non-conten-
tious, and one most important clause,
copied from the English Act, made it
mandatory on all patentees to manufac-
ture their devices within the Common-
wealth. If they failed to do so within
a fixed number of years the patent was
void. Had such a clause passed into law
Australia’s manufactures would be in a
more flourishing condition than they are
to-day, and a great number of useful
devices would have been cheapened con-
siderably.
But the bill, which passed the Senate,
was dropped in the Reps, owing to crush
of business, and for some extraordinary
reason has never been revived. As the
Act stands to-day, Australia is stung by
foreign patents, holders of which put up
the price of their wares or, even if they
permit manufacture in Australia under
royalty, charge the local manufacturer all
the traffic will bear. But possibly the
most vicious feature of all is that a
patent, foreign or local, can be bought,
put into cold storage, be of no benefit
to the public, and absolutely hold up any
inventor who works out an improvement.
For instance, if a man in Footscray
or Newtown invents an improved method
of lighting cigars and tries to patent it,
he may find that away back in the ’nine-
ties a man in Albania invented a similar
device, but one that was not nearly so
effective. The Albanian sold that inven-
tion to a firm which bought it simply
to prevent somebody else buying it and
interfering with existing profits from the
old type of cigar-lighter that particular
firm was turning out. It was buried and
forgotten until the possibility of an im-
proved edition of it appeared. Then the
original patent was trotted out and used
as a barrier to prevent the later inventor
and the potential manufacturer getting
the device before the public.
In England nothing of the sort could
occur. If the first firm bought a patent
and * cold-stored it, the inventor of an
improvement could immediately protect
it, the time limitation having meantime
voided the original patent.
♦
Is Oratory Declining ?
Mr. George Pollock, Speaker of the
Queensland Parliament, set a precedent
last week: — .
In these days when the decadence of
Parliament is being discussed outside, I
should like to say that the four speeches
made so far in this debate in the space of
64 minutes are the best speeches I have
heard in Parliament.
Other Speakers don’t express such
opinions. The four orations so highly
praised related to the harbor which is
to be built as a sea gateway to Mackay,
the Premier’s constituency. Mr. Smith
himself, the first Demosthenes, was natur- •
ally enthusiastic, but to those not versed
in" oratory his effort seemed to be the
usual second-reading catalogue of terms
and conditions and contractors’ names,
handled in the manner in which Mr.
Smith always handles a subject. That
is to say, he plodded warily up to it and
then slowly masticated it with the richly
deliberate air of a gillie eating porridge.
Mr. Bayley, the member for Wynnum,
who followed him, once graced the
House of Reps., but an unfair tradition
which favored W. M. Hughes, P. Mc-
Mahon Glynn and W. A. Watt seems
to have denied him the laurels which he
has now earned in cataloguing the sugar
areas of North Queensland. Still, he
must have made something outsize in
speeches, for otherwise nobody would
have remembered him at all after Mr.
Randolph Bedford, who, when firing
charges of corruption at “Tories”
(as he was on this occasion), en-
dangers the integrity of the candel-
abra and shakes the flowers off the
jacaranda-trees outside. And both of
them might reasonably have sunk into
oblivion before the sonorous passages of
Mr. Fadden, last of the four, who told
his gaping auditors that “Mackay will
be producing sugar when other districts
are forgotten” and yet that lighterage
“has been as high as 12s. 6d. on sugar
and 19s. 6d. on inward cargo.”
It was Mr. Joe Lesina who once held
the Queensland House enthralled for six
hours while he aired his views on a
railway bill, and who pictured a Minister
“rushing panic-stricken through his elec-
torate, his beard torn by the west wind
and his conscience safely hidden in his
shirt.” This is rather better than Mr.
Fadden ; and the golden voices of J. T.
Bell, James Blair, Dalrymple and John
Leahy have also been heard in the halls
where Mr. Forgan Smith is a star. But
nobody contradicted Mr. Speaker, and
in a democracy there can be no answer
to a unanimous vote.

Fined for Being Beaten.
Eighty-three candidates lost their de-
posits at the Commonwealth elections.
“One of the 83” writes to The Bulle-
tin: —
During the campaign I spent £ll2 in adver-
tisements, £l2O in postages and another £l5O
in travelling, printing, etc. On top of this, 1
forfeit my deposit of £25. It has been suggested
that it would be a generous gesture on behalf
of the Government to return forfeited de-
posits, and surely it should.
The provision for forfeiture was justified
as a means of preventing a lot of irrespon-
sibles getting themselves nominated simply for
the purpose of obtaining cheap publicity. It
was never meant to penalise properly-selected
representatives of recognised political organisa-
tions, such as the A.L.P. or the Douglas
Credit organisation, who, through being
squeezed out between highly-organised and
wealthy political parties, failed to get the
requisite number of primary votes.
The Act should be amended to permit the
Chief Electoral Registrar to refund the deposit
of any candidate who satisfies him that he ex-
pended not less than £lOO bona fide. It is to
the advantage of the community that this
money should be so spent, and it is not reason-
able that the men who spend it should be
penalised for so doing.

Consumers Don’t Count.
Sydney is the theatre of an elaborate
annual joke called “Health and Milk
Week.” The health part is all right; the
joke is associated with milk, and it is
on the consumers.
Each year some special jest is staged.
Last year it was a notification that the
minimum retail price was to be 7d. a
quart. This year it takes the form of
“restriction of output”—“Hansard’s”
name for it.
As far as supplies go, Sydney and Mel-
bourne are better catered for than any
cities of their size in the world. But
supplies are in each case controlled by
a board. At the beginning of the month
the Melbourne board announced a re-
duction of l|d. a gallon in the wholesale
price, making it 9|d. a gallon for milk
forwarded by rail, lOd. for road deliv-
eries to dairymen’s premises, and 9yd.
for delivery at factory or depot.
The retail price was previously “6d.
a quart in jugs and 7d. in bottles.”
Before the board was set up, bulk milk
was sd. and bottled milk 6d. The House-
wives’ Association is clamoring for a
return to that tariff, and the chairman
of the board has promised “investiga-
tions into these questions with the aid
of a chartered accountant.”
According to the Melbourne chairman,
“the reduction in the wholesale price
was due to improved seasonal condi-
tions and better flow of milk.” The
same conditions rule in the N.S.W. dairy-
ing districts; but “restriction,” not “re-
duction,” is the word in Sydney. A
Parliamentary report, condensed:
Milk: Restriction of Output.
Mr. Weaver: Organisation of the supply
and the fixation of guaranteed minimum
prices from lid. to Is. per gallon, coupled
with good seasons, have resulted in greatly
increased production... .This increase can
only be placed on the market at the expense
of the other supply districts. The board
has decided, therefore, to determine the
maximum quantities of milk which will
be taken weekly from three supply dis-
tricts [Liverpool, Toongabbie and NarellanJ
and the maximum quantities of milk
which will be taken from individual sup-
pliers. v
There was a restriction policy already,
entrance to the metropolitan market
being confined to a few specified districts
and then only for certain specified days.
This extension of it is naturally resented
by the neighborhoods affected ; at a meet-
ing of dairy-farmers at Liverpool bitter
things were said. It is resented also by
the consumers ; but in Sydney consumers
don’t count.
In theory control of commodities by
boards is a good thing for everybody;
but it seems that only a few people really
do well. Among them, of course, are the
persons who get on the boards.

"AND IT'S PRINTED WITH WIMBLE'S INKS"
“Dumpling”: Mildenhall in Suffolk,
the starting point for the great air race,
is an ancient market town in the north-
east of the county; one suspects
this is the first time it ever got into
the cables. There is a certain appro-
priateness in its selection for a racing
event, for only a few miles away is New-
market Heath, where another sort of
racing had its organised beginnings in
the time of James 1., and the Jockey
Club came into being and probably the
first bookmaker shouted the odds. Of
Newmarket it was recorded a century
ago that “nearly half of the town’s popu-
lation [some 3000 in those days] are
trainers, jockeys, stablekeepers and
grooms.”

“Say 99”: “Deaf as a beetle, doc.,”
he growled. “Can you do anything for a
man?” One look into his ears, and 1
said “Wax —tons of it. We’ll soon hose
that out.” When the syringe had re-
stored his hearing, he asked “What’s the
cause, doc.? Would the ’air flyin’ do
it?” I looked wise, and replied, “Well,
yes. Lots of aviators get deaf after long
flights. Roar of the engines and so
forth, you know. Poor chaps can’t hear
a sound for hours, sometimes.” The
patient grinned. “I’m not a haviator,
doc.,” he explained ; “I’m a ’airdresser.”

“M.G.”: In an unguarded moment the
“Argus” published, without a diagram
or explanatory map, the fact that Lord
Milne was the Constable of the Tower
of London. A story is current in Mel-
bourne that a Toorak lady, after assimi-
lating the item, remarked, “Just imagine,
my dear, that Lord Milne we were trying
to get out to our place is only a police-
man!” She probably featured him as
directing the traffic in front of the Tower.

“Night Rounds”: After investigating the
death of a 13-year-old Melbourne girl,
Coroner Grant returned a verdict never
entered before in an Australian court.
The victim and a younger sister were
molested by a man in a train while re-
turning from a children’s birthday party.
The elder girl, terrified by the brute’s
behavior, jumped from an open carriage
as the train was entering Richmond
station and fell, fatally injured, almost
at the feet of her father, who was wait-
ing to bring his children home. The
coroner’s finding was “murder by fear.”
So far no arrest has been made, and as
there are 11 other wanted murderers at
large the prospect of laying hands on
this one is not hopeful.

“M. de Paris”: It is hard to think
that anyone could waste an atom of
sympathy on Martha Rendall who
ever read an account of her methods in
murdering one stepchild and bringing
others close to death’s door (B.
17/10/’34). Nothing more horrible is
recorded of Brinvilliers. The children had
measles, and the doctor gave her a pre-
scription for a liniment to paint the
throats. She substituted muriatic acid,
and several times daily applied this to
the throats of the wretched children.
When the screams of agony brought in
the neighbors, they were put off with
the exhibition of the doctor’s liniment.
The post-mortem on the dead child
showed that its throat tissues had been
burned away by the liquid fire. No
wonder Attorney-General Nanson tore
up the petition for mercy.

“Bombardier”: Newspaper writers
have been gushing about the beauty
of the Duke of Gloucester’s 10th Hussar
uniform. One authority on costume
took strong exception to it, though in
his time it had the additional attraction
of a heavily-furred pelisse hanging over
one shoulder. This was George Brum-
mel, appointed by the Prince Regent as a
cornet to his pet regiment. Brummel
objected to many things, including
early-morning parades at Brighton, the
quality of the wine at mess - and his
colonel’s manners towards him, but
most of all he objected to the uniform.
His protests being disregarded, he ap-
peared one morning on parade in a stag-
gering uniform designed by himself.
Even the Regent couldn’t stand this, and
the Beau’s papers went in.

“Sealed Pattern”: “A.J.S.” notwith-
standing (B. 17/10/’34), the R.A. still
wears the fur busby when in full
fig—some photos, of a levee in a recent
London paper show a group of gunner
officers thus topped off —and “A.J.S.”
“Stand back a bit, Miss Goldie —I can’t see your right foot!”
can take it for certain I am not confusing
them with their be-braided brethren of
the R.H.A. Another unit which wears
the busby on State occasions is the
Honorable Artillery Company. I did not
include it in my first list, since the
H.A.C. is not a regular unit, though much
older than most of them. No need, either,
for “A.J.S.” to bemoan the passing of
the bright uniforms with the arrival of
mechanisation. They are still there for
ceremonial occasions, and that applies to
all arms.
* * * x
“Derek”: At a Perth welcome to mid-
shipman Stirling, of the Sussex, a great-
great-grandnephew of the founder and
first Governor of the colony, one of Col-
lier’s Ministers remarked that Westralia
hadn’t much to offer in the way of tradi-
tions, but it was a very British com-
munity, less cosmopolitan than the
Eastern States. Actually, of course, it
has traditions that go back further than
anything in Australian history ; Dutch-
men were murdering and being mur-
dered on the Abrolhos 100 years before
Cook was born, and Dampier had a look
at the coast when James 11. was still King
of England. The claim that Westralia
is more British than any other part of
the Commonwealth would be even harder
to substantiate. Undoubtedly it was
once ; for the first 50 or 60 years of its
existence the colony got very little popu-
lation from outside Britain, and Kipling’s
lines “We learned from our English
mothers to call Old England home” would
have had special application there. But
the gold discoveries altered all that; they
brought a rush of t’othersiders that very
soon outnumbered the native-born West-
ralians, and when such people spoke
vaguely of “home” it was to Victoria
and N.S.W. their thoughts strayed back
rather than to Britain. And goldseekers
came from other parts of the world,
many to remain. The assisted immigra-
tion of the pre-war years doubtless made
Westralia a bit more British than it had
been since the ’eighties, but I suspect it
is still the most thoroughly cosmopolitan
part of the Commonwealth.
* * * *
“Wellingtons”: Admittedly a keen
soldier, the Duke of Gloucester also has
the ideal figure for any uniform which
includes hessian boots or the tight over-
alls worn throughout the service with
the staff frock and other “blues.” Most
of his appearances in this country have
been in the blue frock and overalls, and
the fact that he has a leg the same size
all the way up gives the becoming cos-
tume added elegance, while the same
may be said for the Hussar hessians.
The warrior with calves like champagne
magnums should avoid overalls at every
cost, and high-boots also, if possible. I
saw a revered friend of mine, a brass-hat
of some tonnage, in blue frock and over-
alls at a big function the other day. He
gave me the impression, somehow, of a
billiard-table walking on its hind legs.

“Findy”: “Pat’s Penny Paper,” pub-
lished in Adelaide, is, according to the
claim of its editor, publisher, sole pro-
prietor and, apparently, sole contribu-
tor, “the one and only penny paper in
the whole of Australia.” It must cer-
tainly be the smallest, with its four pages,
11 inches by 9. It serves to ventilate
“Pat” Lyall’s views on political, economic
and literary matters, racing notes, a serial
story, personalities and verse being
thrown in for good measure, and there
are some delightful touches about it. A
recent editorial mentions that
The leading article written a week ago for
the second issue of this paper has most
unfortunately had to be rewritten, as the
pendulum of the political clock did not
swing in the desired direction.
It’s a thing that occasionally happens
higher up, but few editors can afford to
be so candid.

“El V.”: What does it matter whether
or not Captain Cook ever set foot in
the dour-looking Great Ayton cottage
(B. 17/10/’34) which Melbourne has im-
ported, complete with ivy? Half the
shrines in England wouldn’t stand a Royal
Commission —places like the Cheshire
Cheese, for instance, allegedly the haunt
of Dr. Johnson, of whose actual presence
there no evidence whatever exists, though
he led an unusually well-documented life.
And half our accepted biography is false,
too. Encyclopaedias and Fellows of the
Royal Historical Society persistently
repeat that Governor Lachlan Macquarie
was the “eldest son of the 16th chief of
the Macquaries,” though the very first
pages of his own journal flatly contradict
the statement. And as for the heroes of
the Melbourne centenary —if some of
them were debunked with the aid of
records left by their contemporaries,
Mr. Masefield would have to tax his
ruder village vocabulary to do justice
to them.
“McMud”: “Tripod” says Tibby Cotter
got his issue in Palestine while relieving a
mate on fatigue (B. 10/10/’34). Actu-
ally he got it while the 3rd Brigade was
making history by charging the Beer-
sheba redoubts. I can speak with cer-
tainty, because I was splashed by the
shell that did the damage, and Tibby’s
horse nearly brought mine down as it
crumpled up in my tracks. The cricketer
died as they were bringing him into
Beersheba after dark.

“Sherlock”: The detectives who have
been trying to establish the identity of
the girl whose partially-burned body was
discovered in a culvert near Albury
(N.S.W.) can’t be accused of lack of
thoroughness. All other means having
failed, and all clues proved delusive, the
police of two States have now been given
the stupendous task of tracing every
woman between 25 and 30 who should
have voted at the Federal elections and
didn’t. The hope that a solution of the
mystery will be supplied in this way in-
volves a vast amount of conjecture. It
presumes that the victim was a resident
of either N. S. Wales or Victoria, that
she had been long enough in any divi-
sion in either to be entitled to vote, that
her name was on the roll if she were so
entitled, and that, presuming all these
things, her claim to be enrolled gave her
correct age—even the “25 to 30” is no
more than an estimate, though supported
by the dictum of a professor after the
closest examination of the remains. In
fact, the sum total of conjectures is so
heavy that the search is more likely to
prove a wild-goose chase than not. Still
—there is always a chance.

“El V.”: One of the
latest kingdoms to go
constitutional is the Mal-
dive Islands, a Sultanate
under the protection of
Ceylon, whose squat,
dark ruler is probably
the only British ward in
Asia who hasn’t an
0.8. E. or a C.I.E. He
makes up for it by pos-
sessing an ancient title of
“Lord of 12,000 islands
and 13 atolls.” Actually,
there are only a few
hundred islands, all coral
and cocoanut palms. The
people are one of the
cleanest and smallest
races in the world phy-
sically swarthy, the
men lighter in color than
the women. The abso-
lute monarchy was abol-
ished in 1932, but Sham-
sudeen Iskander, whose
second name is a relic of
Alexander the Great’s
wanderings in Asia, re-
mained on the throne
with his wings clipped.
He has now been heaved
out of his wooden palace
on Mahe. He must have
committed something
outsize in indiscretions,
since the islanders,
though Mohammedans, are a peaceable
lot.

“Pardon Me”: Allusions to “fruitolo-
gists” and the like recall a recent utter-
ance by Mr. Justice Charles in England
when the driver of a corporation dust-
cart described his vehicle as “a freighter.”
“We talk so delicately now,” was his
Ludship’s comment. There is a story
of a bank messenger, sent to find a
member of the staff, who repaired to the
most likely place and asked “Have any
of our officers been here this morning?”
Bung rose to the occasion. “Yes, one
of your officers left a few minutes ago,
with his sword behind his ear.”

“M.G.”: Days without trams gave
Melbourne an opportunity of testing the
capabilities of ’buses to shift the popu-
lation, and the mobile vehicles, aug-
mented by a militia of private cars carry-
ing passengers pro tem., made the experi-
ment seem fairly successful. People suf-
fered little in delay, and the absence of
trams provided more room for the cars.
Yet, strange to say, traffic jambs were fre-
quent, though an army of policemen was
detailed to control the streams. At in-
tervals, the lights would change with
the line of cars half-way across the inter-
section, and all Melbourne would be held
up until they were sorted out, with con-
siderable possibility of accident to mud-
guards and bumpers. The question is
still unsolved, and the arguments of those
who quote London are not yet proved.
These people overlook the fact that the
greater part of London’s passenger traffic
is carried by the tubes and that, if these
did not exist, ’buses would fill the
streets from Shepherd’s Bush to Bow.
MILDENHALL TO MELBOURNE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Across the world we wander in,
Through storm and shine the aircraft spin,
With never one hut’s out to win
A stake worth scooping, arrah!
They hit the breeze, through day and dark,
To write across the sky their mark
Trom Mildenhall beside the Lark
To Melbourne on the Yarra.
From fens where, histories relate,
Boadicea held her state
Till ruthless Romans crashed the gate
With sword and fire and pillage,
With arrowy speed they cleave the air
And almost arrow-straight they tear
Towards the waiting city where
Was once but “Batman’s village.”
From Mildenhall ’twas theirs to soar
Aloft—a name that means no more
To most of us than Appledore,
Or Tolpuddle, or Selborne.
But thus are linked the ends of earth,
No matter what their date of birth,
From old Persepolis to Perth,
From Mildenhall to Melbourne.
Here’s luck to each aerial ace!
Intent we watch from many a place,
Whether the fleeting ’weight we chase
Or fell the stately jarrah.
He’ll strike an all-responsive spark
Who pilots first his humming barque
From Mildenhall beside the Lark
To Melbourne on the Yarra.

“M.G.”: A recent cable from London
regarding the mix-up of babies in a
maternity hospital recalls a Collingwood
(Vic.) case. Two five-year-old boys were
brought before the Court on the same
day, dirty and uncared-for, and charged
as neglected children. They were re-
manded for a week, during which the
police spoke severely to their mothers.
When the cases were called again, the
Bench added a few more words of warn-
“The jolly old farmah will be annoyed at our crashing into his wheat, what!”
ing, and the kiddies were handed over.
One woman took the boy assigned her
by the hand and went home. The second
vigorously protested to the constable
“This is not my little boy,” but was
Assured that it was. She went home only
half-convinced. A day or two later a
neighbor, who had known the child well,
confirmed her doubts, and she repaired
to the police station, where matters were
presently straightened out. The second
mother, after her own offspring had been
restored, admitted that she had had a
suspicion about the changeling. He kep
askin’ about th’ cookoo clock,” she ex-
plained, “an’ we never ’ad no cookoo
clock.”

“F.L.8.”: Historians award no credit
to Martin Cash for the establishment of
Melbourne ; yet he may have had a bit
to do with it. Anyhow, this is the tale I
had from a Tasmanian of the third gen-
eration —his grandfather was one of our
earliest settlers. A little while before the
expedition to Port Philip sailed, one of
the Argonauts was surprised by Cash.
“You wouldn’t shoot me, would you,
Martin?” he asked. “I haven’t done
anything.” “No,” said Martin, “I won’t
shoot you, but if you were Batman 1
would. You can tell him to get out of
the country if he doesn’t want to be
shot.” The expedition sailed next
morning.

“Sixenate”: In Sydney the other day
a quick-goer performed the remark-
able feat of stealing a ring from a
jeweller’s, pawning it, getting drunk and
being locked up —all within a couple of
hours and a hundred yards of thorough-
fare. He pinched it so skilfully that the
loss was not immediately detected ; walk-
ing into a pawnshop a few doors away
and wearing the ring as if it was a
prized possession, he had no difficulty
in getting a loan on it; and if he had not
prolonged his stay at the corner pub he
might be having a good time still. Be-
coming quarrelsome, he was removed
forcibly and arrested for drunkenness ;
and the pawnticket put the show away,
the loss of the ring having in the mean-
time been reported.

“Bank Clerk”: “Con Tango” (B.
10/10/’34) is behind the times regarding
the reduced size of cheque-books and
-forms. Quite 10 years ago the late
Bank of Commerce issued cheque-books
measuring only B|in. x 2£in. ; the
Commonwealth and the ’Wales soon
followed suit. The old bush phrase
“a cheque as big as a blanket” probably
did originate from the fact that many
firms had their own specially-printed
cheques of generous dimensions. Even
now many pastoral and other companies
use cheques which are absurdly over-
sized, the waste paper on them being a
means of cheap advertising.
* * . # *
“General Prac.”: I imagine that “Elec.
Engineer” (B. 17/10/’34), busy, no
doubt, with wireless sets and vacuum
cleaners, has had little leisure to observe
the effects of lightning upon the human
frame. I have, and I still maintain
that a wet man, caught in a storm, is
the man likely to perish. We die by
lightning-stroke because we are part of
a conductor between some cloud and the
surface of the earth, and a Wet man is
a good conductor. Broadly speaking,
lightning obeys all electrical laws ; above
all, it picks out the good conductors.
Grab the knobs of a small battery with
dry hands and you feel nothing but a
pleasing thrill. Wet your hands and you
get a shock, in more ways than one. Dr.
Poore, the best medical jurist England
has seen, tells how four peasants were
working in a field. One of them, look-
ing skywards, said, “*Rain coomin’, laads ;
let’s room” They ran to a near-by shack,
where three of them sheltered, the fourth
remaining outside. Then the heavens
opened, the thunder roared; the hut,
split to flinders, departed upon the wind,
leaving its occupants unscathed. Out-
side, they found the soaked body of
peasant No. 4, dead, and wearing only
the left arm of his singlet.
* * * *
“Downy”: The growth of whiskers (B.
3/10/’34) is no more fostered by the
feminine vogue for athletics than it is
by bobbing and shingling. An elderly
“Be a sport, sarge! Ring up the wife and tell her I won’t be home for dinner.”
aunt of mine, who never wasted an hour
on either craze, has for years been
obliged to borrow her husband’s razor
twice a week. And had I, no athlete and
equally unshingled, begun to shave when
20 years ago hair first appeared on my
chin, I suspect that I might now earn
a living as a bearded lady in a circus.
Nevertheless, shaving would have been a
lot cheaper than the depilatories, bleaches
and electric treatment I’ve tried in those
years.
* * * *
“Cinna”: The fierce light that heats on
Masefield recalls that Australia once had
a Poet Laureate, though one may look in
vain for his verse in any anthology. His
name was Michael Massey Robinson,
and he was a disreputable attorney, trans-
ported from England in 1798 for an at-
tempt to blackmail. He obtained a con-
ditional pardon soon after landing, but
fell from grace again and was sent to
Norfolk Island. However, Macquarie
finally gave him a Government job, and
he was principal clerk to the police
department when he died in 1826. After
his reformation he recited odes of his
own composition at Government levees
held to celebrate royal birthdays, and did
not forget to praise his patron. For
instance, when Macquarie started a
school for youthful aborigines Robinson
would come along with a reference to
the institution which
Shelters with pious care the houseless child,
The lone inheritor of woodlands wild.
Robinson’s reward came two or three
years before his death, but it wasn’t in
the form of a butt of sherry. A record
in the Mitchell Library, where most of
his doggerel is preserved, sets forth
that Macquarie granted him “two cows
from the Government herd for his ser-
vices as Poet Laureat.”
* * * *
“El V.”: The Cannebiere was not a
bad choice as a site for the assassina-
tion of a king. Marseilles is a sinister
town ; a British Consul disappeared off
the face of the earth there without caus-
ing more than a mild sensation. Sarajevo
was better. It is half Oriental, with
plenty of red fezzes and brigand mous-
taches and frowning fortresses on the
surrounding hills. A little tablet marks
the spot where the 19-year-old Gavril
Princip stepped on to the footboard of
the royal car and fired the first two shots
of the Great War —the only two Sarajevo
heard. The inscription says that he
“spoke out for liberty.” A few yards
further down the street a chattering
crowd fills the small cafe where he waited
drinking slivovitza to keep his courage
up. Not far away, in a departmental
office, a dark, stoutish man sits, or did
a few years ago. When he rises he walks
with a curious motion. He was
one of the “liberators” who sat with
Princip the night before the shoot-
ing. Afterwards he had the bastinado,
and two strong Austrian coppers took
him by the shoulders and rolled him one
way, and two others took him by the
ankles and rolled him the other way—on
hard stones for a few hours at a time.
He went to gaol—and lived to occupy
the office to which he was taken when
arrested. Princip died in prison in 1918.
* * * *
“G.M.”: Vic. Judge Foster’s observa-
tion about the non-existence of hell has
raised a turmoil in Melbourne second
only to the centenary preparations. The
earlier comments of the church leaders
dodged the question, but when the pious
laity entered the fray they proved once
more that the civilian behind the lines is
ten times more bloodthirsty than the
shock troops. Some of the letters are
unconsciously humorous, as witness the
ultra-orthodox gentleman who assured
the “Argus” that by wiping hell off the
map Judge Foster had “hurt the feel-
ings of a large section of the com-
munity.” One correspondent adroitly
quoted the opinion of Stephen Leacock’s
corporation lawyer who had to decide a
dispute between two churches on the
subject: “The matter of eternal damna-
tion shall only be settled by a majority
of the shareholders of both institutions
holding not less than 80 per cent, of the
common stock.”
* * * *
“II Vecchio”: Public men who expect
to wait on the Duke have failed in tact
in not preparing the way for the wearing
of silk hats, with the result that this
comfortable headgear is now being sub-
jected to the disapproval of the
moron press. Plus-fours were in similar
disfavor a few years ago—officers of the
British Fleet who came ashore at Jervis
Bay in them in 1924 were greeted with
unpolite remarks about “mother’s pan-
ties.” Then a team of professional foot-
ballers arrived arrayed in knee-breeches,
and after that the democracy was re-
conciled to them. Khaki shorts, for
long standard military and civilian
wear in the Indian summer, were hooted
on Balmoral Beach (Sydney) the year
before an air hero appeared in them and
the flapper press discovered that they
showed more leg than skirts. Every
bank messenger wears a topper in
London, Hitler’s executioner is never
without one, and I have seen the whole
of a Soviet embassy thus surmounted.
FAIRIES.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“I think we all believe in fairies, in some form
or another.” — Governor Game at the opening of
“ Titania’s Palace
’Twas but the other day a Judge
In straight-flung words suggested
That hell was supposititious fudge—
And very few protested.
We scrapped the picture long ago
Of fire-and-brimstone regions
Where sinful souls in torment glow
And devils grin in legions.
Old Nick has lost his horns and tail
And none know where his lair is,
But even logic may assail
A firmer faith with no avail —
We still believe in fairies.
There’s some that vanish with the dawn,
Elusive sprites and downy,
Like pixie, elf and leprechaun,
Apart from gnome and brownie.
And fairer fairies, not beyond
The line ’tween fact and fancy,
Are gay brunette and glowing blonde
(Whichever’s your fiancee).
What though they flit your zodiac through,
As Taurus chases Aries,
You’ve always one at least in view.
So incontestably it’s true
We still believe in fairies.
We still are lured by many a ramp
Remotely corresponding
To bold Aladdin’s magic lamp
Or Merlin’s magic wand-ing.
We fall beneath the wizard’s spell
Who from the hustings thunders
And claims to be an Ariel
At miracles and wonders.
The twigs are plainly smeared with lime,
Before our eyes the snare is,
Yet in this free, enlightened clime,
Especially at ’lection time,
We still believe in “fairies.”
We cherish tales of rainbow gold
And cheerfully we dally
With thoughts that distant hills enfold
Another Sindbad’s valley.
Soft voices whisper, when we lie
In Morpheus’ snug embraces,
Straight tips what stock is best to buy,
Dead birds for next day’s races.
From what dim realm the dinkum oil
Arrives opinion varies,
But in this life of wear and toil
What lots of dreamy joy ’twould spoil
Not to believe in fairies.
Each rolling year, it seems, a chap
His old ideas must straighten.
We’ve wiped Gehenna off the map
And said “So long!” to Satan.
I can’t profess to greatly care
What haps to him or Hades,
But the Little Men we’ll never spare,
Nor yet the Little Ladies.
Let positivists snort and sniff,
The witness that I bear is
This world would bore a fellow stiff
And gloom would be his portion if
He hadn’t faith in fairies.

POLITICAL POINTS
A syndicated article on the recon-
structed Canberra Ministry, while on the
whole friendly, admits that “it is almost
entirely city and suburban.” Equal to
suburban handicaps, in fact, but not up
to Cups.
This increase in gold production has
a tragic side. It is costing Westralia
about £60,000 a year to care for sufferers
from miners’ phthisis. The new tax on
mine profits is expected to yield quite
£20,000 more than that.
Still conducting his campaign against
the Labor Government, alone but with
the points heavily in his favor since it
violated precedent to save Gray, M.L.C.,
from the consequences of his breach of
the Electoral Act, E. J. Hughes, once
Labor member for East Perth, has set all
Westralia grinning at the expense of Will-
cock, who had Gray “pardoned.” Will-
cock he describes as “The Minister for
Just Us.”
Lyons is not a man who worries, but
he will need all his phlegm during the
next few weeks. Not a few U.A.P.
members think he made a hash of the
negotiations with Page, and there remains
the doubt as to what that party will do.
Then Belgium has given notice that if
“Who’d have thought he’d ever be
a riddle?”
Australia goes on shutting out its sheet
glass, it will shut out South Australian
barley. Naturally Lyons does not want
to hurt a new Australian industry, but
he can’t stand by and see an old industry
destroyed. For one thing, if he did,
South Australia would be lost to the
U.A.P.
White, the Minister of Customs, has
the toughest job at Canberra. In simpler
days if a Government wanted to help an
industry it simply imposed the duty it
thought sufficient; protests, if any, could
be ignored. Now nearly every protec-
tive item has to be considered in relation
to the effect overseas. Every country
(except perhaps Tibet) is in the export
trade, and they have all learned some-
thing of retaliation ; some have made it
a fine art. So it is not enough nowadays
for the tariff-maker to be a protectionist.
He must have a well-furnished modern
mind, know a lot about human nature
and be a good deal of a diplomat.
Leichhardt, the N.S.W. Assembly seat
which Lamaro, Lang’si last Attorney-
General, gave up to . contest Federal
Watson and could not regain, has gone
to one Matthews, presumably because the
Inner Group preferred him to Lamaro.
The voting was 9546 for Matthews
and 5616 for Dyer, a Fed. Labor
man, with two Independents, and a Com-
munist distanced. The U.A.P. has given
up contesting by-elections for certain
Labor seats like Leichhardt. Its idea is
that this prolongs the faction fight by
giving the weaker faction an appearance
of strength.
Lang, roaring at Leichhardt, accused
Stevens of having “robbed the unem-
ployed of ten millions” by diverting that
amount of relief-tax money to other
objects. Stevens’s unemployed-relief
measures have been stodgy and ephe-
meral, but this enabled him to make an
effective comparison: 661 persons on
relief work in Lang’s last month of office
and 80,000 now. It is easy to score off
Lang, and easy—in a sense, too easy—
to win elections when the Rage of Auburn
is in the field.
There is a row over the bill which
Forgan Smith has introduced to pre-
serve the Queensland sandalwood indus-
try. In the legislative definition sandal-
wood is not Santalum lanceolatum only,
but “the wood of any tree which the
Governor-in-Council prescribes.” Anti-
socialists protest that this is over the
odds. Socialists bid them remember
that they live in a State which has de-
clared the dingo a marsupial and has a
Sugar Acquisition Act under which the
Government once seized the lighting
fixtures of a sports ground to prevent a
pony meeting being held.
It must be hard on the nerves to have
to stand and sit day after day exposed
to the gaze of strange multitudes, and
the standing part is especially trying
when prolonged by prolix speakers. In
this respect South Aus. was considerate
to the Duke of Gloucester; and the
Duke was grateful. In Victoria he has
been the victim of wearying verbosity,
the worst offenders being personages old
enough to know better. Evidently they
can’t get out of their ingrained habits,
for it is an old Victorian fashion. After
every big Melbourne football match
speakers invade the dressing-rooms of
the winners and give it lip till they have
exhausted themselves and everyone else.
Victoria is the last fortress of the wind-
bag.
Amalgamated Wireless made a profit
of just on £138,000 last year, and de-
clared a 10 p.c. dividend, amounting to
£74,000. The Commonwealth gets half
of that, as well as taxes, “land, income
and other,” having a half interest in the
highly-successful concern, plus the odd
vote. A.W.A. is now making its wire-
less-telephone service pay. It might be
a good thing to let it take over the Gov-
ernment telephones and telegraphs, which
show staggering losses year after year.
Tas. Labor has put through a measure
changing hotel-bar hours from 6 a.m.-
6 p.m. to 10 a.m.-lO p.m. The altera-
tion was bitterly opposed by ex-Premier
Lee, but his party was far from unani-
mous. Two effective speeches for it were
made by returned soldiers. Said Dwyer,
V.C.:
While we were away fighting for freedom
and democracy, six-o’clock closing was
established by those who stayed at home.
And Major Davis, the Minister of Lands,
said that one effect of 6 o’clock closing
was that bloods provided themselves
with liquor beforehand and took it to
parties and on joy-rides. With regard
to certain insinuations:
I went through the war without a drink,
and don’t know the taste of spirits.
After June 30, when defeated Senators
retire, there will be only six Labor men
in Canberra with any sort of Ministerial
experience: Scullin, Green, Forde, Beas-
ley, Holloway and the re-elected Bren-
nan. Eleven of Scullin’s Ministers will
be missing for various reasons —Theo-
dore, Blakeley, Moloney, Chifley, Culley,
Anstey, Barnes, Dooley, Daly and, of
course, Lyons and Fenton. If the U.A.P.
were magnanimous, it would offer the
Opposition a portfolio or two to prevent
the country being burdened with mug
administrators when Labor gets back.
But all are for the party in these matters,
and none for the State.
This was said in the Sydney Parlia-
ment the other day by the Minister of
Transport:
The Commissioner for Road Transport
is doing his utmost to prevent vehicles not
constructed for carrying passengers from
being so used, and also to prevent vehicles
constructed for the carriage of goods from
competing with vehicles constructed for
passenger transport.
In Melbourne the Minister of Trans-
port has been doing exactly the opposite.
It was his bad luck to be presented with
the first bantling by Wagecut out of
“Co-ordination”—the first of the litter
of strikes.
Weaver, the N.S.W. Minister of
Health, seems to have dropped his gran-
diose plan for distributing milk in the
Government schools. While he was blus-
tering and shuffling, the British Govern-
ment was arranging to provide a mil-
lion pupils in elementary schools with
milk at a halfpenny for a third of a pint.
The milk is guaranteed and delivered in
bottles, local authorities getting it at a
shilling a gallon. Unlike N.S.W., Britain
has no superabundance of milk, but then
it is not oversupplied, with Weavers.
Land men on N.S.W. shire councils
drew up a sound scheme for putting un-
employed on small subsistence farms in
the neighborhood of country towns, and
got it embodied in an Act. The Stevens
Governpient pigeonholed it and substi-
tuted a scheme for housing out-of-works
in Sydney suburbs where three-fourths
of the existing cottages are for sale. The
first Government shack has gone up at
Fairfield. The local municipal building
inspector reports that “the sides are bulg-
ing and out of plumb,” and that the place
has other defects; but a little thing like
that won’t discourage the “anti-socialist”
Government.
Still excited as a result of the Prince’s
visit, and with another £400,000 coming
from the Commonwealth, the Butler
Government has agreed to pay ex-
“Stop that caterwauling, will y’? It says
here your Government’s going to
give y’ three thousand five hundred!”
Premier Hill £3500 as compensation for
the loss of the London job to which he
appointed himself. This should relieve
Hill from the necessity of becoming a
pavement artist or a kerbstone singer.
To an interviewer he suggested that he
might have to do something like that.
Randolph Bedford, M.L.A., has been
seen, in a performance suggestive of a
long-inactive volcano bent on proving
that it hadn’t retired from business. Sud-
denly discharging steam, he asserted that
hanky-panky work was going on in con-
nection with the Mackay Harbor con-
tract, mentioning a company and certain
Startling eruption, with an unexpected
effect.
“Tories.” The “Tories” replied that Ran-
dolph was talking through his hat, and
it transpired that a Labor personage was
chairman of directors of the company.
Driven to admit that he had got the name
of the company wrong, Randolph was
still rumbling at the week-end, but no
one was paying much attention.
With an election only a few months
off, the Forgan Smith Government is ap-
pointing a commission to “reallocate”
the electorates, which have changed so
much in the last decade that their own
mothers wouldn’t recognise them. They
were “reallocated” last under the Moore
Government, which reduced members
from 72 to 62. It was suggested that the
Forgans might make the number 65, but
they have decided to let well alone.
Opponents of “reallocation” morosely
suggest that the new map will be ready
in time for the A.L.P. Congress to pass
judgment on it in February.
A new political organisation has sprung
up in Maoriland. It stands for abolition
of State enterprises ; a guaranteed mini-
mum price for exported farm produce;
reduction of the exchange-rate to parity
with sterling, of the tariff on goods from
the U.K. and of the cost of government;
and loans to farmers at reduced rates of
interest. A. E. Davey, for many years
organiser for the Reformers, has crossed
over to the “Democratic party,” as it
calls itself, and says it has influential
backing.
It was here mentioned last week that
the N.S.W. Railway Department had ad-
mitted losses of £32,100 on its refresh-
ment-rooms for two years. Since then
the report for the year to June 30 has
arrived ; it claims a profit of £5331. De-
preciation, reckoned at £B3B in 1932-33,
now figures at £10,638, but the item
“maintenance of equipment, £9669,” has
disappeared (incidentally, so has the item
“rates and taxes”). Depreciation and
maintenance of equipment are not the
same thing. Sargents, who run a com-
peting business, but, unlike the railway
refreshment-rooms, have no liquor
license, showed a profit of £9300 last
year, after allowing for “maintenance and
repairs” and depreciation, and after
paying rates and “taxation, with the ex-
ception of land tax.”

Argyle, who will be 67 in December,
is the oldest of the Premiers whom the
Duke will meet; the youngest is Ogilvie
(43). Collier is 60, Butler 49, Forgan
Smith 47 and Stevens 45.
Dr. Jerry Weigall, who has been
appointed medical adviser to the Duke
during his stay, is Melbourne’s leading
society medico, though social position
alone would never have won him his new
job. A Prince’s physician has to possess
solid merit as well as the ability to wear
a dress suit with dignity and aplomb and
cut up meat with a fork. Busy as he is,
Dr. Weigall finds time to write very
creditable plays.
The Duke saw something of Austra-
lian staying power when playing polo—
he plays hard and well —in Adelaide. On
his side were Cecil Bray (son of a long-
ago Premier), vtfho does not talk about
his age now; and Frank Downer (a
former M.F.H.), who does. Downer has
just touched 70, when one grows proud
of it. Both are lawyers —a hardy breed.
The Anglican Bishop of Wangaratta, in
placing his clergy, has an ear for
euphonious effect. The rector of Violet
Town is the Rev. C. G. Lavender, who
lives in Primrose-street. At' the neigh-
boring town of Bright the rector’s name
is Hope.
Menzies, K.C., the new Common-
wealth Attorney-General, was, like his
predecessor Latham, K.C., a man who
owes his position to having won a State-
school scholarship as a youngster. Starke,
J., of the High Court, is another. So is
surgeon Hughie Devine. In fact, the
proportion of scholarship winners among
the big fellows down south is solid, and
grows more so every day.
Rev. H. E. Warren, missing in the
Hobart mail-’plane disaster, was trained
as an engineer in his youth in Melbourne.
Then he went to Moore College (Sydney)
and joined the Anglican ministry. His
early training stood to him when he went
to the N.T. as a missionary ; he pioneered
the Tanumbirini motor track with a
Ford and became a good boatman in
the days when he was establishing Groote
Eylandt mission. In the end malaria
got him, and he retired to a living in
Tasmania, but last year he was one of
the two missionaries who were sent to
treat with the Caledon Bay natives. In
a few weeks he would have become
rector of Enfield (Sydney). Warren was
a man’s man —everybody had a good
word for him in the Territory.
Hardboiled newspapermen and trade-
union secretaries took a sad farewell of
Charlie Lee, found drowned in Sydney
Harbor. Gentlest of souls, Lee began
writing for the “Westralian Worker”
when a shop assistant at Kalgoorlie 34
or 35 years ago, and settled down in
Sydney as a trustworthy chronicler of
Trades Hall news. An A.J.A. man from
the beginning, he became State president.
The rise of radio and the craze for news-
paper amalgamations have been hard on
veterans of journalism like Charlie Lee.
At 71, Major Righetti, who left
Queensland in 1915 as second in com-
mand of the sth Light Horse, has gone
to join Hubert Harris and many other
old companions. He had served in the
Boer War with a Victorian mounted
regiment before coming to Queensland.
After reaching Egypt he took over com-
mand of the 2nd L.H. Brigade depot at
Maadi. The death of his son Alan at
Romani dealt him a blow from which the
old gentleman never recovered. He did
transport work between Australia and
Egypt until the Armistice, and then re-
tired from the military forces.
Dr. J. E. Thomson, who has got his
flier’s license at Stag Lane (Eng.) at 69,
is an Australian with a cosmopolitan
training. During the war he was attached
to the Queensland Health Department;
then he strolled off to New Guinea and
the Malay States, where he is still fighting
the mosquito. He is an accomplished
linguist, and has taken post-graduate
courses at several Continental universities.
Brisbane Chamber of Commerce has
chosen E. K. Tully, a solicitor, to be its
president during its 75th year. He is an
old King’s School and Brisbane Gram-
mar boy, who served his articles with
one of Mcllwraith’s Attorneys-General,
the late A. J. Thynne. Thirty years ago
he was an alderman of the city, and
lately has given a lot of time to U.A.P.
politics and mercantile bodies. He has
a sound commercial practice in partner-
ship with his schoolmate, L. C. Wilson,
who was a private in the South African
War and a much-decorated brig.-general
in the last one.

Jim Mathews, dead in Melbourne at
69, succeeded Sam Mauger as M.P. for
Melbourne Ports, and remained its
member for 25 years, but was a physi-
cal wreck long before his retirement in
1931. A tailor by trade, he was more
noted for his interjections than for his
speeches. Many an angry scene Jimmy
averted with a good-humored quirk flung
at a speaker at the right moment. He
never reached Ministerial rank. Before
Fate played its cruel prank on him the
poor fellow was (of all things) chairman
of the Committee on Causes of In-
validity and Death.
Promotion in the Bank of Adelaide
brings Allen Shepley to Sydney as ac-
countant. He was with the Field Artil-
lery in France, and later had some years
in Melbourne ; but Adelaide is his home.
He has been chairman of the Baseball
League there, and is a useful cricketer.
The press cars which followed the
Duke on the day of his arrival in
Melbourne were the subject of weird
speculation on the part of the
crowd. Some said the occupants
were Secret Service men, innocuous
to the eye, but armed to the teeth.
Others held that they were private secre-
taries, each dealing with some phase of
the Prince’s activities. The most remark-
able suggestion heard was from one old
chap who solemnly ‘ assured all within
hearing that they were directors of the
Bank of England, sent out to see that
due economy was observed.
Died in Melbourne, Rev. Tregear, who
filled many front-page items a generation
ago as one of the Three Musketeers of
Puritanism in Victoria —the others were
Rev. Woodfull, father of the cricketer,
and Rev. Worrall. The D’Artagnan of
the party was little Judkins, a layman,
but the most brilliant and bitter of the
lot. Judkins it was who charged a knight
with owning property in “Little Lon.”
when “Little Lon.” was not to be men-
tioned in mixed company. Judkins died
young without ever attaining his ambi-
tion to get into Parliament. His brother,
a qualified Rev., is still going strong in
Victoria.
Charles Westmacott (he abominated
people who called him “Charlie”) was
almost the last of the old theatrical
brigade. He belonged of right to the
J.C.W.-Harry Rickards era, of which the
sole remaining survivor is now Bland
Holt. Westmacott was originally an
actor of sorts, but his outstanding gift
was tact. That and his resonant public-
school voice. As a J.C.W. man his job
consisted largely in soothing, exasperated
mummers. Few men living could do it
better. The friendly pat on the back ;
the booming voice with the vox Humana
stop full out; the fine eyes, expressing
unutterable sympathy and understanding
—all these he commanded at will.
Though Australia was his home, he re-
tained a passionate love of England to
the end of his days. He was one of the
first to join Sydney’s English Public
Schools Association, and up to the time
of his last illness he claimed to have
attended all the association’s gatherings.
From Bathurst:
The late Pat Kenna, who, as Pat Bathurst,
was a J.C.W. musicomedy star when Flo Younp,
and George Lauri were in their prime, belonged
to an interesting family. His father was a
Bathurst identity when some more famous
families were virtual newcomers. All the
Australian Kcnnas (kinsmen, by the way, of
the British cavalry V.C.) were born fighters
and born showmen. Pat, in addition to being
extremely good-looking in his youth, was a
sound actor and the possessor of a first-class
baritone voice. Dick couldn’t act or sing, but
he made a small fortune by taking a boxing
kangaroo to London, where it was the rage at
the old Aquarium between the Green Park and
Victoria-street. Later Dick returned to Bathurst
and ran a pub. It used to be said that he and
Pat knew every detail of every family of note
in the west of N. S. Wales.
The late Asquith—Lord Oxford to-
wards the end—disliked “the colonies”
and referred scornfully to “Dominion
‘statesmen’ ” in one of the letters col-
lected and published by a lady friend ;
but he excepted two Australians, the
brothers Murray. This is from the com-
pilation referred to:
Gilbert Murray brought his “big brother”
to lunch. I liked him very much. He is
enormously tall and spare, and has a
sun-dried complexion and skin of a man
who has lived long in the tropics. He has
been now for 20 years governing Papua,
a sort of outlying spur of New Guinea,
and, I should judge from his account of it,
a most God-forsaken spot.
That was written 11 years ago, and
Asquith has been dead nearly seven
years, but at just on 73 Murray is still
governing the “God-forsaken spot.”
Henry Dobson, admitted to the Tas.
Bar, is of the fourth generation of Dob-
sons who followed the law. He joins
Dobson, Mitchell and Allport, who have
carried on for over a century ; there are
four other legal firms in Hobart which
include representatives of the fourth
generation. The new barrister wore
for his initiation the wig and gown in
which his great-grandfather made his
first appearance in court.
From a friend:
Dr. W. J. S. McKay, of Lismore (N.S.W.),
who was fined last week “for failing to keep a
record of drugs used, procured and supplied,”
has always been handicapped by his best
qualities. Some suffer from “bad” hearts;
“Bill” McKay’s trouble is a good one. He
sent a former patient some morphine because
she wrote that she was “in great distress” —
meaning great pain—and that caused the police-
court proceedings. A few years ago he was one
of the biggest amateur punters in Sydney. In
that capacity he brought off an enormous bet-
ting coup. Necessitous friends got various
presents ranging from £lOOO to £5OO till, as a
final reckoning, the doctor banked rather less
than he had originally wagered. All doctors
operate on scores of patients free of charge
year by year (and not public-hospital patients
either). “Bill” McKay at the height of his
powers and fame gave his services for nothing
to hundreds. The son of a sporting doctor
who lived in the Parramatta district when
hounds met there regularly and Sydney Burde-
kin’s hunt breakfasts were institutional, Dr.
McKay has stuck to the same hobby for the
best part of half a century. JHe probably
knows more about the thoroughbred horse than
any other man in Australia. Paradoxically, he
is also an authority on Dante, and he has
written extensively in British and Australian
papers on both subjects. He had been senior
surgeon at Lewisham Hospital for 40 years
when he went to live at Lismore the other day.

Having decided to bury the hatchet and
go on the market together, this co. and
the Cumberland Board Mills (Sydney)
passed over their assets to an operating
concern, Australian Paper Manufac-
turers, for scrip in 1926. Shareholders
have no cause for regret, though the trad-
ing co. clipped 4s. per share (£320,000)
off its capital (now £1,280,000), of which
A. P. and P. owns £993,511, which figures
in its books at £1,241,889, no adjustment
having been made.
For the last term A. P. and P. was able
to show 9.3 p.c. on its capital (£1,152,618,
of which £228,500 carries a cumulative
8 p.c., with the right to advance with the
ords. up to 10 p.c.) as against 8.7 p.c. and
8 p.c. for the two preceding terms ; and
the all-round 8 p.c. div. was repeated,
again free of the special tax on income
from property. On the market the prefs.
fetch 38s. 2d. and the ords. 365. 3d. as
against 345. and 30s. 3d. a year ago. The
return at the higher figures is 4.4 p.c. and
4.2 p.c. respectively on an 8 p.c. div.
basis.

Over the last five years net earnings have
more than trebled, while the average sell-
ing price of the co.’s products has been
reduced by over 15 p.c. (=£250,000),
thanks to exchange and the tariff and the
management’s assault upon costs. The
profit claimed last year (up £15,842) was
written after adding £73,522 net to de-
preciation, taxation and loss of profits
reserve (£530,172). The div. was not
stated ; appearances are that it was 11
p.c. or thereabouts.

In conjunction with Tasmanian Paper
Pty., the co. has brought out an English
expert (Mr. Woodhead) to decide the
long-considered question of manufactur-
ing printing and writing papers from Tas-
manian hardwoods. Together with the
State Government, it is also considering
the erection of a pulp mill (k*raft) in S.
Aus., where thinnings from the State soft-
wood forests are available ; and another
pulp mill may be put up at Twofold Bay,
where an option from the N. S. Wales
Government over large timber areas
(eucalyptus, etc.) is under consideration.

§Kor quarter ended June 30, 1931.
After a short run of satisfactory earn-
ings, the co. soid the goodwill of the
now-defunct “Daily Guardian” and
“Sunday Guardian” to Associated News-
papers early in 1930 for £575,000
£400,000 in 7 p.c. prefs. and the balance
cash. That was a stroke of good busi-
ness ; the economic barometer had just
begun to fall. After rubbing out the
£lOO,OOO at which the goodwill of the
“Guardian” had been capitalised, the
share part of the consideration was
whacked up among the ords. That was
not so good ; it deprived the co. of the
right to £28,000 p.a. (subject to 22\ p.c.
statutory cut), or more than twice the
annual requirements of its own £150,000
of pref. capital, which the public
put up to start the “Guardian.” Later
Joynton Smith handed back 80,000 of
the 200,000 Associated prefs. he received.
Meanwhile, the goodwill of the “Referee”
and “Arrow,” two sporting journals, was
bought at a “satisfactory figure,” reputed
to be £40,000; publication of the
“Arrow” ceased in the next term.
For the three years to the close of
accounts in 1933 it was a very sick busi-
ness ; from one cause and another
£106,474 of the net tangible assets
evaporated. The direct cost of litigation
alone was £23,157 during the 1933 term.
The co. has since steered clear of liti-
gious adventures, and reorganisation of
the Vic. subsidiary and abandonment of
a Sydney freehold to the vendor have
further helped to ease the strain —the
capital loss on the freehold was £ 17,000-
odd, and mortgages were reduced by
£39,228. Also, during the 12 months
covered by the latest accounts adver-
tising revenue looked up, and the year’s
trading operations ended with a profit of
£4027 as against a loss of £12,323 for
the previous one. But the pref.-div. guar-
antee to the Vic. co. called for £2200,
which reduced the net gain to £1827,
leaving £123,250 of the £150,000 of ord.
capital unrepresented by tangibles when
the books closed. That disregards a con-
tingent liability of £32,147 (=4s. 3d. per
share) in respect of arrears of pref. divs.
Incidentally, the co. has guaranteed both
capital and div. on £37,500 of 8 p.c. pref.
money in the Vic. subsidiary.

During the year the co. repaid an ad-
vance of £5422 from Joynton Smith,
clipped £25,492 off the overdraft (now
£17,528), £2762 off the amount coming
to sundry creditors (£28,763), and the
mortgage (£60,869) was down £2ll. To
do all this, debtors’ balances, cash, etc.,
were reduced by £20,300 (at the end of
Sept., 1933, there was £42,000 coming
from Associated in respect of the
“Guardian”), stocks by £7060, and £4699
more was written off than was spent on
plant. Including stocks and sharehold-
ings, the more or less liquid surplus
(£18,621) was £6526 stronger than at the
previous balance.
Over the twelvemonth the market
lengthened its bid for the fully-paid
pound prefs. from 3s. 9d. to Bs. 2d. The

This is the only cement manufacturer in
Queensland, where concrete-road con-
struction has not been pushed with the
same vigor as it has in the southern
States. Considering the steady fall in
the price of cement, and that plant capa-
city (60,000 tons p.a.) has always been
well ahead of demand, which fell away
so abruptly that the works at Darra
were closed for two-thirds of the 1931
term (slump coincided with completion
of the construction programme at Mt.
Isa), the co. has come through the last
few difficult years extraordinarily well.
The prefs.—there are £44,878 of first
8 per cents, and £182,183 of second 6
per cents, in a paid capital of £245,061 —
rank in the order stated for divs. and
capital, and advance with the ords. after
the latter have had 6 p.c. For the three
years to the close of accounts in 1930
the ords. got 8 p.c., followed by a steady
6 p.c. for the next three.
During the last term demand for the
co.’s product increased, due to revival of
the building trade and growth in Govern-
ment spending—Queensland’s loan ex-
penditure was £3,166,000 as against
£2,188,000 for the previous year.
After openly striking off £lO,OOO
for depreciation, and setting aside
an extra £2OOO for the taxgatherer
(£12,000), the net improvement was £5353.
There was enough to give the prefs. their
minimum requirements and the ords.
6 p.c,, plus another all-round 2.2 p.c.
An extra 1 p.c. was distributed, making
9 p.c. for the firsts and 7 p.c. for the
seconds and ords.
The year’s better trading is also re-
flected in the next table:

To carry an extra £13,042 of book debts
and £20,203 of cash, etc., stocks were
reduced by £7456 and £3692 was added
to the amount coming to sundry credi-
tors. The improvement in the more or
less liquid surplus (£108,050, including-
stocks) was £22,097.
With the scheme for utilisation of the
shell-lime deposits in Moreton Bay near-
ing completion (it is expected to further
reduce costs), and several large Govern-
ments works in prospect, the outlook for
the current term is bright enough. Over
the twelvemonth the firsts advanced
from 28s. 6d. to 31s. 6d., and the seconds
from 225. 6d. to 265. 3d. At the higher
figures the returns are 5.7 p.c. and 5.3
p.c. respectively on the basis of last

There was a nice spring in advertising
revenue, thanks to the improvement in
conditions generally, and further bene-
fits followed the overhaul of the organisa-
tion which began a couple of years ago,
when the “Daily News” (Perth) was giv-
ing the board a headache, and the
“Barrier Miner” (Broken Hill), never
much of a contributor to the pool, threat-
ened to become a nuisance; the “Re-
corder” (Port Pirie) was sold at a loss.
The “News” and “Mail” (Adelaide)
always have been, and still are, the back-
bone of the business, which is now linked
up with the Melbourne “Herald” people
through an exchange of scrip (150,000
ords.) with the “Advertiser” Co. The
year’s gross earnings (£182,851) were
£18,244 better, while exes. (£164,755, in-
cluding some non-recurring outlay) took
only £3938 of the increase. After hand-
ing the prefs. their 8 p.c. (£4000), enough
remained to show 3.7 p.c. on average
ord. capital, and a 2\ p.c. div. was dis-
tributed—the first thing of its kind since
March, 1930.
During the second half of the term,
the co. got rid of its £60,500 of 6 p.c.
debentures (the remains of £85,000 origi-
nally gathered to help finance the Perth
venture), which carried a premium of
1 p.c. p.a. to date of maturity, Feb. 28,
1936. The premium was paid in cash.
Most of the paper was exchanged for
ords. on a par basis, and the uncon-
verted balance (£15,570) was redeemed:

The growth in ord. capital was £71,880.
Apparently 26,950 shares were issued for
cash. This, together with an extra
£18,893 from sundry creditors (£58,747,
including an unspecified overdraft) and
the year’s surplus earnings, plus a bit
more than usual for depreciation, en-
abled the board to redeem the uncon-
verted debentures, wipe out a mortgage
of £7OOO, carry an extra £4BOO of stocks
and add £35,613 net to investments,
debtors’ balances and cash. Investments,
mainly shares in and advances to the
Perth subsidiary, are shown separately at
£292,974 for the first time.

provement in the co.’s position, and

High-grade furniture and furnishing
drapery are difficult lines at any time, as
this co.’s irregular earnings during the
boom years show. For nine years fol-
lowing the reconstruction of 1920 (31
ords. Were then handed out for every 16
previously held, and the pref. div. was
lifted a point) the ords. averaged 6.3 p.c.;
the next four were dry ones. Mean-
while, the old high-priced stocks, which
were responsible for most of the trouble
in ’3l and ’32, were cleared or got into
line with fallen values, more attention
was given to overhead, display and
prices, the shop was kept open on Fri-
day nights, and, as conditions generally
improved, the figures recovered.
The sharp spring of £16,076 in last
year’s net result largely reflects the re-
vival in the building trade. There was
enough to pay a full year’s pref. divs.
(together £4882, after allowing for the
statutory cut) and show 4.9 p.c. on the
£381*687 of ord. capital. Actually the
prefs.’ slate was cleaned and the ords. got
24 p.c., the £2695 that remained reducing
the amount of capital unrepresented by
tangibles to £15,758 —goodwill (£67,660)
has not been treated as an asset herein.
There is nothing in sight at the moment
to suggest a sharp contraction of turn-
over. Prospects of the ords. receiving a
bit more than 2\ p.c. at next balance are
thus encouraging. The market prices
them at 16s. as against Bs. 9d. a year
ago. At the higher figure the return is
3.1 p.c. on the basis of last year’s dis-
tribution, or 5 p.c. on a 4 p.c. div. basis.
Allowing for the statutory cut, the firsts
at 235. return 4.7 p.c., and the seconds
at 265. 4.8 p.c. The book value of the
net tangible cover is £l4 18s. lid. firsts,
£7 19s. 4d. seconds, and 19s. 6d. ords.
There is nothing uneasy about the
finances:

The year’s brisker trading is further re-
flected in a growth of £10,587 in debtors’
balances, £2248 in stocks, and a reduc-
tion of £7050 in liabilities, which in-
clude an unspecified amount of mort-
gage money. The spring in the more or
less liquid surplus (£240,639, including
stocks) was £18,798.
Queensland gold yield reached 10,461
fine ounces for September, the best
monthly record since the gold boom
started. This brings the total to 83,2850 z.
for nine months of 1934. Mt. Morgan,
Cracow and Mt. Coolon produced nearly
80 p.c. of it; the host of other small
fields are almost at a standstill so far
as increased production is concerned,
despite lavish grants for prospecting.
While Coolon is booked to drop out
next year, several interesting possibilities
may recoup the northern State for that
loss. The tipsters point to Ravenswood,
the Oaks and Gympie as most likely to
step into the breach. If all three come
up to what is expected of them, the
State’s production will rise sharply, and
the Golden Mile, Cracow, has struck a
couple of rich shoots.

Kingston Gold Mines, near Brisbane,
treated 350 tons during August for an
average of about 21dwt. There is almost
a mountain of gold-bearing rock, but
output needs to be 10 times greater than
it is in order to cut costs and get ahead
of it. Vision and well-laid-out plans
might make a success of the show, pro-
vided the price of gold doesn’t drop.
* * * *
Fred Reid is taking out what was left
at Mt. Wandoo (N.Q.) by Alex. Mac-
donald’s co. The ore is being concen-
trated at the 10-head mill, and about 50
tons, averaging nearly 2oz. gold and 6oz.
silver, is dispatched monthly to Chilla-
goe smelters. Operations have been tem-
porarily suspended till the water supply
is replenished.

Wiluna’s final div. of 2s. 6d., making
4s. 6d. a share for the year 1933-34, is
just half what Australian shareholders
expected. Large profits have been
earned, and on Oct. 12, when the final
disbursement was announced, the co. had
enough in hand to pay ss. a share and
show a substantial cash balance as well.
An interim distribution on account of
the current year is expected shortly.

“O.B.”: Lake View and Star has half
the Kalgoorlie Golden Mile in its grasp,
and is, according to London reports,
anxious to grab more. The co.’s first
acquisition was Lake View Consols and
Hannans Star. For these mines and
£30,000 of working capital 500,000 fully-
paid 4s. shares were issued. Subsequently
the Chaffers block was bought for
£11,115, and in 1924 the Ivanhoe Gold
Corp. sold its property for 400,000 Lake
View shares and took up a further
100,000 at par. In 1929 Golden Horse-
shoe was bought for 90,000 fully-paids,
and in March last the Associated was
snapped up for 100,000 paids. Lake
View’s capital is now £560,000 in 4s.
shares, and its properties cover an area
of 583 acres. Total production of these
properties to date, including the periods
prior to purchase by Lake View, is
valued at about £40,000,000.

Gt. Boulder (W.A.) was about due for
the usual write-up from Westralian
newspapers, and got it. Ore-bodies on the
eastern side are declared to be maintain-
ing good widths and values, and pros-
pects for their downward continuation
are said to be bright geologically. The
difficulties encountered by the new plant
in gold extraction are vanishing, and,
with some slight improvements, the mill
“will be as efficient as any other in
Australia.” The market is not im-
pressed ; it will probably await publi-
cation of Ernest Williams’s report on the
mine, plant and equipment before decid-
ing which way to jump.
* * * *
There is talk in London of a distribu-
tion being made to Associated (W.A.)
shareholders before long. The co.’s
assets include 100,000 Lake View and
Stars, a wad of Wilunas and some cash.
* * * *
Westralia’s latest spectacular gold find
is in a new belt of country about 25
miles from Southern Cross and six miles
south of Yellowdine, on the eastern gold-
fields line. A bit of rich stuff has been
got on or near the surface from one or
two blocks, and holders are demanding
high prices for the remaining ground.
One venturesome expert, who suggested
that the find was a contact and unlikely
to be permanent, had difficulty in avoid-
ing a quarrel with interested parties.
Melbourne-controlled Timoni is instal-
ling a treatment plant on its Westralian
goldmine at Mt. Ida, north of Menzies,
and the board expects to send bullion to
the bank early in 1935. Results from
development suggest that shareholders
have a good chance of receiving divi-
dends.
* * * *
Haveluck G.M. Co., Adelaide, which
has installed a diamond drill to prove
the ore channel at depth on the Radio
Deeps, at Manxman, north of Bullfinch
(W.A.), has now taken six months’ option
over the Radio. This show has been
worked by Barr and Clements since 1915,
and has yielded £200,000 worth of the
precious metal; the main shaft is down
280 ft. on the underlay. The price is
£60,000, of which £lO,OOO will be in
shares. From the Deeps £BO,OOO worth
of gold has been extracted. The Radio
North, owned by Healey and Allsworth,
has also to be tested by the co.
* * * *
In an interim report on Lake View
South Extended’s property, Kalgoorlie
(W.A.), Dr. Larcombe says there are
four, and probably five, lode channels
in the area, and they lie within the
quartz-dolerite-greenstone which is the
chief lode-bearing rock formation on
the Golden Mile. The co., formed in
Sydney a couple of months ago, paid
£60,500 for the property (£13,000 cash
and the balance shares), and the public
put up £127,500 in ss. shares. The inten-
tion is to unwater No. 4 shaft to 500 ft.,
crosscut to No. 6 shaft from the 300 ft.
level, prove the ore available between
here and the surface, and prospect the
show at depth by diamond drill. The
possibilities of the scrip will depend
largely upon disclosures at depth. Else-
where the producing rock of the Boulder
Belt has been proved down to 4000 ft.

Ora Banda Amalgamated’s 1200-ton-
a-month mill, now being erected, was
designed by A. E. Faul, the manager,
and Victor Edquist, superintendent at
Sons of Gwalia, in conjunction with
Bewick, Moreing and Co. The driving
force will be a 156-h.p. crude-oil engine,
to which the battery, tube mill, classifier,
thickeners, agitators and Oliver filter will
be connected up by belting from shafting.
The lot is expected to be in operation
by the end of this year or early in 1935.
* * * *
Westralian Gold Development syndi-
cate has a month’s sampling option
over five prospecting areas, totalling 100
acres, on Wiluna’s eastern boundary. If
things look good enough, a six months’
option will be taken and the show more
thoroughly tested. The purchase price
is £3500, payable one-third cash and the
balance shares.

Lady Gladys, Mulline (W.A.), con-
tinues in rich ore, the last 115 tons re-
turning 1370 z. of gold, without the sands.
The accumulated sands and slimes are
reckoned to have a recovery value of
£2500. The water problem seems likely
to crop up during the summer months.
♦ * * %
The Edjudina Co., Yarri (W.A.), is
sinking three shafts in which values range
from 4dwt. to Bdwt. To date 60,000
tons of 6dwt. stuff has been proved, and,
since the stone can be mined by open-
cut, costs should be low. There is talk
of erecting a 250-tons-a-day plant.
* * * *
After six weeks’ stay on Edjudina’s
Westralian gold show, mining engineer
Travers Black says that 60,000 tons of
6dwt. stone has been proved, and that it
can be mined by opencut at low cost.
If further developments are satis-
factory, a kick-off treatment plant of
250-tons-a-day capacity will be installed.

“Old Hand”: The purchase of mills
and batteries by many of the recently-
floated Westralian gold-mining cos. re-
calls J. H. Curie’s remarks that, “if a
manager is strong and capable, he will
not hesitate to say whether the mine is
sufficiently developed to warrant the in-
stallation of a mill, and whether funds
are sufficient for development of the
property in addition to the erection of
plant.” Premature erection of plant is a
waste of shareholders’ money.
BRIEF ANSWERS.
L.H.S.: Hold 1,2, 5 and 6; sell the
others... .Army: (1) Accounts made up to
November 30 and presented in March. (2)
and (3) See “ ‘Wild Cat’ Monthly,” May, 1934.
....J.L.: Yes, more likely to come out of
B.H.P. than the bonds... .A.McG.: Shows a
very good return at present price, with a
fair chance of further capital appreciation....
H.F.M.: (1) Fully-paid 13s. 4d. shares sold at
12s. Id. last week. (2) Last div. 5 p.c.; next
one payable in February. (3) Write to any
member of the Stock Exchange, stating the
number of shares you want to 5e11... .L.M.:
(1) They are a long-term speculation, and
guesses as to the amount of profit likely to be
realised aren’t worth much. (2) Don’t think
so. (3) The trustees should act strictly in
accordance with the terms of the will. There
should be no difficulty about having bonds
transferred to beneficiaries. Write to the secre-
tary, Kembla Buildings, Margaret-street, Sydney.
If it is necessary to sell fractions, ask him if he
can find a buyer... .H.J.T.: Vendor’s considera-
tion usually in cash and shares, based on the
actual and prospective value of the property
to be taken over. Too high a price means
immediate overcapitalisation and the possible
failure of the float... .E.R.C.: (1) Prefs. worth
cohsideration are Hordern Bros, firsts, F. T.
Wimble, Anthony Hordern, Dunlop Perdriau
and Berlei. At last week-end they all re-
turned between 4| p.c. and 5i p.c., and, owing
to the N. S. Wales Interest Reduction Act,
the first 'three carry the possibility of further
capital appreciation. Lustre at 275. 3d.
return 5f p.c., also with possibilities. (2)
Peters’ Arctic promises to make a better
showing at next balance. (3) “ ‘Wild Cat’
Monthly” posted J.S.: (1) Yes; for year to
Sept. 30, 1933, 2* p.c. (= £38,750) was paid
“out of profits from operations other than
mining.” Investments, mainly in fertiliser in-
dustry, figured at £1,450,170, or £215,978 less
than their face value. (2) Roan Antelope,
which has huge deposits of copper ore in
Northern Rhodesia, can produce electrolytic
at much lower cost. (3) Not very bright at the
moment. It is chiefly to the U.K., the rest
of Europe and Japan that Empire producers
have to look for markets... .C.A.M.: Further
recent drop in interest rates favors small rise.
....Apex and E.W.L.: Making inquiries
A.F.McL.: Have asked co. for balance sheet;
will reply when received... .W.H.J.: (1) Triton,
Lancefield, Rothsay. (2) Hold H.J.W.: (1)
Allowing for the board’s estimate of anticipated
losses, etc., there was approximately 9s. 3d.
per pound of paid capital left. The market
prices the scrip at 6s. 2d. Doubt is what
the properties, some of which are a drag at the
moment, will actually fetch when they can be
sold—Castlemains Perkins has first refusal for
20 years....(2) Speculative. McWhirters worth
consideration W.G.8.: The co. is having a
hard struggle to negotiate the corner. Assum-
ing that the assurance funds exactly covered
liabilities under policies, then net tangibles
were £lB,OOO-odd short of the mark at Aug.
31, 1932 W.C.: Both have good prospects
of further capital appreciation.

Progress
Back in the days when Australia's export
trade was in its infancy, the Bank of New
South Wales provided the pioneer merchants
with all necessary banking facilities.
And throughout the past 117 years, the Bank
has constantly extended its services to assist
producers of all kinds and to finance the rapid
expansion of what is now a vast oversea
trade, bringing millions of pounds to this
country.
Through a network of over 720 branches the
Bank provides every facility for financing
internal and external trade. It maintains a
highly efficient British and Foreign Exchange
Department which advises customers on all
exchange matters, including the buying and
selling of forward exchange.

The Economy Factor of
Belting

- ■ ■
SAFE IY FIKST
Make all belt joints with
Pioneer Rawhide Laces
They are strong, flexible and
definitely safer to work with.
The first cost of belting is, in
itself, no indication of its
economy. Economy should be
reckoned in terms of long life,
trouble-free service and reduced
running costs. It is in this con-
nection that Pioneer Leather
Belting reveals true economy.
With Pioneer” you buy more
than "just another belt.” You
get freedom from costly "hold-

highly efficient service.
Only specially tanned, high-
grade leathers are used in the
making of Pioneer Belts and they
are all definitely guaranteed

SHODOW SHOWS.
“Stingaree”
It is interesting to see how Hollywood
produces a play with an Australian set-
ting. It gets through passably in
“Stingaree,” at Melbourne State. The
presentation is fairly accurate, and those
who know Hollywood can guess that
Snowy Baker had a hand in the prepara-
tion of the scenes. Among California’s
own gum-trees, post-and-rail fences have
arisen, and if the squatter’s homestead
looks a bit unusual to-day there were
probably many like it in the ’seventies.
But the bush-pub interior flops horribly ;
it is a cross between a Wild West saloon
and an English inn. The characters are
none of them Australian ; in their strenu-
ous endeavors to avoid being American
they have become aggressively English,
though Richard Dix forgets himself once
or twice and says “gotten.” Dix acts
fairly well, but doesn’t fit the part. He
looks more like a hero of grand opera
than a bushranger. Irene Dunne car-
ries off the honors as the bush drudge
put on the road that leads to stardom at
Covent Garden by the good offices of
the outlaw. She neither underacts nor
overacts, and is light and natural through-
out. Mary Boland is excellent as the
squatter’s middle-aged wife, who en-
deavors to be a flapper,. and Henry
Stephenson, as her husband, suffers in.
silence quite eloquently.
The weak point of the show is the
story. It belongs to the pre-war era of
“Western” pictures, and the producer has
not' succeeded in making it convincing to
modern eyes. At times it is strongly
reminiscent of the old-time silents put
on the screen to amuse the present
generation. It is a T model.
“The Girl from Missouri”
Jean Harlow is a chorus girl whose
aim in life is to marry money. She gate-
crashes in upon the millionaires, one of
whom, impersonated by Lewis Stone,
commits suicide after five minutes of her
company. Of stouter stuff is the self-
made man represented by Lionel Barry-
more. Finding him hopeless she nets
his son, Franchot Tone. Lurv dawns,
and after Barrymore has framed Harlow
and Harlow has framed Barrymore, in
each case for offences against morals,
and after Miss Harlow has got cock-
eyed on gin and quite prepared to part
with her virtue this touching picture of
Frank Harvey, in “Mother of Pearl.”
American society ends in its predestined
wedding bells. Patsy Kelly as a New
York cutie with a penchant for chauffeurs
and lift-attendants provides light relief.
At Sydney St. James.
“Operator 13”
Incidents in the American Civil War.
The story sticks fairly closely to history,
its settings are true to period, and the
appearance of Lee and Grant is re-
produced with fidelity. Marion Davies
is a beautiful spy, Gary Cooper the
strong silent Northerner who wins her
lurv, and there is some effective acting by
Jean Parker and Katherine Alexander,
who share with Miss Davies a talent for
wearing crinolines gracefully. Also at
Sydney St. James.
“Pursued”
A melodrama of lawless life in the
Dutch East Indies. Victor Jory, most
oleaginous of villains, decoys to his
Delysia, in “Mother of Pearl,” at
Sydney New Tiv.
island kingdom a beauteous honkytonk
crooner (Rosemary Ames), having first
had the hero (Russell Hardie), who also
loves the young lady, waylaid, stabbed
and left for dead by sinister-looking
Malays. The crooner will have nothing
to do with Mr. Jory, and does her best to
fade from the pure young life of Mr.
Hardie because she has led a life of shame.
Hardie rescues Miss Ames from the vil-
lain after a hand-to-hand encounter in
the jungle that nearly wrecks the tropi-
cal island, and the rest is one long kiss.
Pert Kelton, who specialises in such
roles, gives a picture of a cafe tart many
miles nearer the truth than Miss Ames’s
version, George Irving is convincing as
a kindly medico, and the settings are
elaborate. But more interesting would
be a candid sequel to this oft-repeated
story. At Sydney Capitol.
“Come On, Marines!”
Also at the Capitol, and also with a
jungle setting, this fantasia does for
Uncle Sam’s marines what has been
done in other film ranches for his Jack
tars, his policemen and his army, horse,
foot and guns. The yarn starts as
comedy, develops into drama and winds
up with farce. The studio blurb mer-
chant promises “marines and girls in
bathing scene....hot dancing number
by Grace Bradley with mirror back-
ground Arlen being ejected from
saloon bar....,” but Mr. Arlen’s hectic
moments have been excised by Mr.
O’Reilly and the foreshadowed delights
have sunk without a trace. The se-
quences that have been spared are bright-
ened by Roscoe Karns as a taxi-driver.
The rest of the cast as marines, Fili-
pino bandits and blondes have little
chance to distinguish themselves.
“The World Moves On”
The will of Sebastian Girard, who died
in New Orleans in 1825, provided for an
international partnership between his
sons (who are to manage branches of his
cotton business in the U.S.A., France
and Germany) and his friend Warburton,
of Manchester. Ninety years later the
business has grown to huge proportions.
The various branches of the family are
intimately linked. Fritz, of the Dussel-
dorf house, marries Jeanne, of Lille. His
brother is in love with Mary Warburton.
So is Richard, of the New Orleans family.
The war sees the partnership temporarily
broken, but after the Armistice the
younger generation, under the leadership
of Richard (Franchot Tone), now married
to Mary (Madeleine Carroll), again raises
it to pre-eminence. A world monopoly
is aimed at, but the depression comes, and
the film closes with the collapse of the
whole organisation and with the world
again heading for war.
Madeleine Carroll has not the scope for
her dramatic powers that “I Was a Spy”
gave her, but she is nevertheless convinc-
ing. Franchot Tone is scarcely a robust
hero, but he carries the part of the im-
petuous young Southerner, and, later, of
the dynamic man of finance, well. The
story is intended to show the futility and
waste of war. The difficulty of the task
was well exemplified by Saturday night’s
audience. Sequences showed the world
seething with militarism. Troops were
shown being reviewed in Berlin, Rome,
Paris, Moscow and Tokio. The American
Air Force was pictured, and finally the
British Navy, at which point more than
half the audience burst into loud
applause. At Sydney Lyce'um.
“The Perfect Flaw”
Here, also at the Lyceum, is a thriller
that is different. The film in which the
murderer gets off scot-free, with the audi-
ence’s full approval, has become trite ;
but in this picture the victim escapes,
yet the murderer pays the penalty, his
alibi being so flawless that it convicts him
of another murder in which he had no
hand. The subject is lightly handled
and the presentation is most successful.
“The Thirteenth Candle”
Incidents likely to afflict six-year-olds
with wide-eyed night horrors have been
carefully smoothed out of this mystery.
One almost hears the producer’s mur-
mured apology when it becomes neces-
sary for a character to appear suddenly,
or otherwise behave according to
approved thriller etiquette. The well-
cast types painstakingly establish motives
which range from the alienation of the
affections of the chauffeur’s girl friend
to threatened disinheritance for stabbing
to death the dastardly squire. Then it
becomes round upon round of cross-
examination by detectives. It being
a British thriller, these remain detectives
Harold Meade, in “Mother of Pearl.”
instead of being unmasked as fiends.
To those who saw her in “Private Lives”
Isobel Elsom is interesting as the long-
suffering wife. She continues to wrap
four yards of scarf around her stately
bosom. Acting quietly, she captures the
desired effect, but her make-up in the
close-ups is bad. At Sydney Civic.
“Of Human Bondage”
A particularly fine piece of character-
isation by Bette Davis, some excellent
photography and conscientious, though
unconvincing, miming by Leslie Howard
are not enough to make this Somerset
Maugham concoction at the Regent in-
teresting. The film at no stage runs
smoothly, and it appears that the censor
has done it much bodily harm. As the
pretty, vulgar Cockney waitress, Bette
Davis does splendidly; her walk, the
way she tosses her head, her speech and
her scornful manner with Howard are
all in character. It is far and away the
best piece of acting writer has seen from
her. Leslie Howard’s medical student
Field Fisher, in “Mother of Pearl.”
is consistent but, by comparison, unreal.
He never impresses as likely to have been
infatuated with Bette Davis, and he makes
no attempt to render his treatment of
Kay Johnson understandable. After he
meets Frances Dee and the influence of
Bette Davis is wearing thin,- he does
better, but even then he’s uncomfortable.
Saturday night’s audience found the
whole business dull.
“Let’s Try Again”
This is much more hackneyed (it pro-
poses an allegedly new solution to the
problems of marital unhappiness) but
far better entertainment. Diana Wynyard
and Clive Brook are the two who find
that after ten years of marriage they’re
a little tired. A great deal of the time
they have the screen to themselves, and
they manage to keep on making it inter-
esting. Hollywood may be short on
originality, but it has a lot of skill in
refurbishing old themes.
Sundry Shows.
On Sunday night Sydney radio-listeners
heard a clear, eager, fresh-toned voice
say a few kind words about John Sebas-
tian Bach and in defence of fugues, after
which the hands belonging to the voice
declaimed the Liszt transcription of the
Fantasia and Fugue in G Minor with
contagious relish. It was Percy Grainger
giving his first Sydney broadcast recital.
The Australian followed with a short dis-
quisition on Debussy as a prelude to
“Clair de Lune,” and then spoke affec-
tionately of Albeniz, whom he declared
to have made the most important con-
tributions to pianoforte technique since
Liszt. “El Albaicin,” from the “Iberia"
suite, based on Moorish themes, illus-
trated this reference. The highest light
of a very short recital was the Chopin
B Flat Minor Sonata, which, surely, has
never before been played in Sydney so
sympathetically and gracefully. Grain-
ger’s feeling for music is that of the
natural man. He revels in fine harmonies
and dramatic dynamics, never distorts
a phrase for the sake of being different,
and plays as sincerely and as unaffectedly
as he speaks.
* * *
Sydney’s Russian Choir, which made
such a good impression with its first per-
formance, did even better on Saturday
night, when its singing in such numbers
as the Tschaikowsky “Credo” and “Hymn
to the Virgin” set a new local standard
for choral music. The Sydney String
Quartet was heard in compositions by
Tschaikowsky and Glazounow, and with
Alexander Sverjensky at the piano played
the Arensky Pianoforte Quintet very

THE OTHER
FELLOW'S
MIND.
Whiners at Work
I thank “F.S.S.” for calling me an old
fogey. The originals of the breed were
gallant old boys whose main duties were
the quelling of Edinburgh bickers. They
were men of action, not the sort of
whiners whom “F.S.S.” seems to approve
when he takes me to task (B. 17/10/’34)
for saying hard words about the pro-
fessional spreader of discontent who
tries to get votes by magnifying the
wretchedness of others and drawing men-
dacious comparisons between Australian
conditions and those of other countries.
“F.S.S.” apparently believes that these
sobbing Jeremiahs are the backbone of
the country, and that it is a good adver-
tisement for Australia to have political
leaders shouting that conditions here are
“the worst in the world” —which means
worse than those of Tatar Bazardjik and
nether-Irkutsk. Well, every man to his
taste. — El Verdugo (N.S.W.).
Secession Pause
These days the Westralian world
moves easily about its daily tasks and
says nothing more about secession. Vain
efforts were made during the Common-
wealth election campaign to rekindle the
old ardor ; fearful was the fall of the
secession candidates. A delegation has
gone to London. Nobody but the dis-
appointed ones cares a dump. All feel
that London is not going to act the weep-
ing mother and order Canberra to re-
pair the damaged feelings of a dissatis-
fied daughter or let the troubled child
go and join Newfoundland.
As a fact, prosperity is returning to
the West. Evidences of it are every-
where, and when there are jobs to be
got and heavier pay-packets to pick up
political issues become secondary. Hence
the pause.— Whitegum (W.A.).
Ex-soldiers in Soup Kitchens
Reference has been made in The Bul-
letin to the hardships experienced by
returned soldiers. In N. S. Wales, where
the preference legislation is ignored,
many are down in the depths of poverty ;
it is safe to say that 600 are living in
soup-kitchens. A large proportion are
married men who have been forced to
break up their homes.
Daily in the press appear reports of
benefits, by way of employment and
otherwise, conferred upon ex-soldiers,
yet the great army of these men, enlisted
now in the army of despair, remains. The
responsibility rests upon Governments.
The Repatriation Department must again
be brought to function fully in the in-
terests of the ex-soldier. Our association
was formed with this object in view. We
claim that if the Governments, State and
Commonwealth, seriously take up the
problem of the ex-soldier he can be
placed in a more satisfactory position
than he has ever occupied.—For the
committee of the N.S.W. Employed and
Unemployed Ex-Service Men’s Associa-
tion, S. Meres, hon. sec.
Why Douglasites Did Well
It was no surprise to me that the
Douglas Credit people polled so well on
Sept. 15. Eight of the 14 men in my
relief-work gang told me they were going
to vote for the Douglas man ; and I have
no doubt they did. They had a very
hazy idea of the Major’s theories, except
on one point; to apply them would mean
a drastic change. In effect, change was
getting my mates’ votes, not the Major.
Having endured unemployment for years
under Labor and U.A.P. rule, they wel-
comed the opportunity to vote against
both.
And the Douglas vote is likely to grow.
The U.A.P. seems blind to the very real
danger that the unemployment of tens
of thousands of men presents, and daily-
press assurances as to the improvement
in the position cut no ice.— Kendal
(N.S.W.).
Our Foresters
This discussion regarding the techni-
cal staffing of forestry departments hasj
been one-sided. Every technical forester
of any experience knows that four years’
theoretical training at a forestry school
is no guarantee of suitability for a staff
job. Years of gruelling bush and ad-
ministrative experience are necessary
before it can be determined whether the
trained man is in any way superior to
the man who has acquired his experi-
ence as he goes along.
In certain cases young technically-
trained foresters have made a conspicu-
ous success of administration, but there
have been many casualties. The peculiar
forest conditions of Australia make it a
very harsh school for raw theorists.
If “Train ’Em” (B. 26/9/’34) is ac-
quainted with the facts he should know
that, so far as the Canberra Forestry
School is concerned, the solution is in the
hands of the States. If trained foresters
are required they will be nominated, but
there is no sense in sending nominees if
there are no places for them in State
departments. As for chances in life
afterwards, men in the game consider
that there are already too many highly-
trained foresters and that an assured
decent living for existing tree men is
much more important than recruiting
fresh victims for what is little more than
a basic-wage job.—Timber Wolf (Vic.).
“Make It ‘Guilty’ ”
“Recommended to Mercy” (B.
3 /10/’34) reminds me of a Criminal
Court case at Darlinghurst which I at-
tended as a juryman. Eight of us were
prepared to give an immediate verdict
of “guilty”; three were doubtful; the
twelfth man obviously didn’t care
whether the accused had committed the
alleged offence or not —he was for “not
guilty” anyway. The three doubtful ones
agreed, rather half-heartedly, to side with
the majority. But No. 12 was adamant.
He knew all about the way these charges
could be framed-up.
Lunch-time came, and with it beer —
half a dozen bottles. Still no agreement.
We paced up and down the walled-in
exercise yard, grew colder and colder
and more frigid in our attitude towards
the dissenting one. Six o’clock, and the
attendant reported that the Judge in-
tended to pack up unless a decision
could be given forthwith. No result.
Then paper and pencils were produced,
and, with the forbidding dormitory and
its 12 iron beds and stone floor in pros-
pect, we proceeded to send out SOS mes-
sages to our homes for .pyjamas and
toothbrushes.
Then our twelfth man weakened. Even
his earnest desire to give the accused the
benefit of the doubt was subjugated to
his disinclination to spend the night at
Darlinghurst. “All right, make it ‘guilty,’ ”
he said. The accused spent 365 nights
or thereabouts in an even less inviting
environment as a result.
It’s a bit of a joke this jury business.
But as all clever people seem to dodge
it for one reason or another, only simple-
tons like myself are called on to serve.
We know little about the law as a rule,
and are certainly inexperienced in sift-
ing evidence. We sit in the jury-box
and try to look judicial, but half the
time our minds are sidetracked by argu-
ment over some technical point. Finally,
in a rather bewildered state, we retire to
consider our verdict—which as often as
not is a woefully unjust one.— Juryman
(N.S.W.).
Models for the Blind
Citizens whose hobbies tend that way
can help the blind by making models
suitable for training the hands and minds
of sightless children. Models of ships
boats, trains, cathedrals and aeroplanes,
would be gratefully received; also
models of bridges, harbors and light-
houses, in fretwork. The Royal Vic-
torian Institute for the Blind can
make good use of everything people
may be generous enough to send along
for those who depend so much upon
touch for their instruction.—S. W.
Hedger, superintendent and secretary.


ABORIGINALITIES
“Barwon”: It was after the sixth pint,
and the argument at the moment was
whether a horse or a bullock was the
better swimmer. Champions of each
animal had exhausted themselves tem-
porarily, and were taking restoratives,
when “Hoop-iron” Morris butted in:
“I’m travellin’ from Queensland,” he said,
“when I strikes the Narran half a banker.
They’ve got a 400-gallon tank cut in halves
hooked on to a wire over the river to
take blokes across, so I dumps me saddle
an’ pack an’ hunts me horse into the
water. He goes clean under, an’ all I
can see is a string, of bubbles. I’m
startin’ to get windy when, stone the
crows, I sees the tips of his horns
stickin’ up out of the water on the far
side!”
* * * *
“Joe Blake”: Noted “Inglegar’s” as-
tonishment (B. 10/10/’34). at seeing my
cobber, Bandy-bandy, dive into a bull-
ants’ nest for refuge, and would like to
hiss into his ear that if he can face the
anger of meat-ants and dig into their
beds he’ll often run across young brown-,
tiger- or black-snakes. As the formic
acid of the average ant is ruinous to our
palates, “Inglegar” needn’t imagine that
the youngsters go in for dinner. Meat-
ants are no less pugnacious than the bull-
ants, and they don’t tackle the intruders.
* * * * *
“Hopjuice”: Nowhere in the world did
the cult of beer for breakfast find more
steadfast devotees than around “The
Dirty Acre,” Boulder Block (W.A.),
in the roaring days. With six pubs,
all drawing beer through lead pipe,
there were gallons of stale lead-
impregnated beer to be thrown away
every morning. Local hummers always
prevented such a frightful waste. One
particular Bayard used to boast that a
couple of gallons before breakfast was
his usual “morning rose.” He didn’t die
of sugar-of-lead poisoning either. Pneu-
monia finished him; he got drunk one
evening and slept on the ground.
* * * V
“Groper”: “Mugshut” (B. 12/9/’34)
talks of the slow growth of the grass-
tree. Actually it is the world’s slow-
est grower. According to West'ralian
Forestry Department, the local Kingia
grass-tree achieves only one foot in 100
years. Thus some of the 12-foot hoary-
heads that line the bush tracks of Groper-
land were three centuries old when
William whipped Harold at Hastings.
Records of such growths have been kept'
since 1840 ; James Drummond, of York,
was the colony’s first botanist.
* * *
“Diba More”: While working in my
front garden the weeding gang un-
earthed and killed a black-snake basking
near some eggs. There were a little
larger than a sparrow’s, were white in
color, had a soft pliable skin instead of
a shell and could be bounced on the
ground without breaking. The young
’uns inside were about 2in. long and had
legs. I nominated them as belonging
to the lizard family. My boss-boy dis-
agreed, and vowed they were young
snakes and that their legs dropped off
either shortly before or after hatching.
Ridiculed the idea, but he appears to
resent the slur I have cast on his know-
ledge of natural history, and has begged
me to write to The Bulletin —which he
uses for cigarette-paper after having seen
the pictures—and obtain a ruling. As we
have a slight side bet in tobacco I would
be glad if some Aboliar who knows
would back me up. He’ll be on half
the stake.
* * * *
“Fledermaus”: Talking of bush deli-
cacies, has any Aboliar tried flying-fox?
Forty years ago an old French sugar-
farmer on the Tweed (N.S.W.) asked my
cobber and me to lunch, and gave us a
perfectly bonzer pie, afterwards asking us
to guess what it was made of. At various
suggestions of pigeon, turkey poult,
chicken and so on, he shook his hand-
some old head. Beckoning us into the
kitchen verandah he produced a grisly
bucketful of fur, claws and leathery
wings, and explained briefly: “Zere are
ze feathers of pigeons you so much
like.” Old Jules showed me the way
“Did y’ pop the question larst night?”
“I was going t’, dad, but the bloke she use ’ t’ go with set fire to the grass”
to skin the beasts so as to get rid of the
glands which cause the smell. Later, I
read Leichhardt’s praise of flying-foxes
as excellent food. They are, and should
be, for the brutes live on the best of
fruit —but, frankly, I’ve never had the
pluck to try them again in cold blood.

“Lugger’s Mate”: Touching that
reference to the rapidity with which shell-
fish grow upon the hulls of out-of-work
vessels (B. 19/9/’34), sunken hulks and
wrecks have been used often to estimate
the rate of growth of marine phenomena.
A Quetta porthole, raised after 16 years,
contained a mass of Pocillopora coral
9in. across by 4in. thick. This specimen
is still in the Quetta Memorial Cathedral
at T. 1., and until less than five years
ago provided the most reliable data re-
garding the speed of coral growths.
* * * *
“Bitter Bark”: Surely the most beauti-
ful butterfly chrysalis is that of the “crow,”
the common black-and-white-spotted
chap known to schoolboys as the “Cape
York.” The place to seek it is on the
underside of the leaves of oleander
bushes and monkey-rope vines, which
are the feeding places of the caterpillars.
When the time comes for the caterpillar
to turn into a chrysalis it suspends itself
from the underside of a leaf, curls double
and liquefies in a few hours. Tt hardens
again into a jewel of gleaming silver,
remaining in that stage about a fortnight,
when it turns brown and transparent a
few days before the butterfly emerges.
* * * *
“Erne”: I have not denied that the
wedgetail eagle catches birds in the air
(B. 26/9/’34) —I only said I had never
seen one trying it. As to a pair attack-
ing a plain turkey on the ground I take
it that this is common enough.. In the
Libyan Desert the Senussi’s people use
them for catching gazelles. The birds
bewilder the animal with strokes of their
wings until the Saluki greyhounds come
up and complete the job. The eagle has
been used for this kind of sport in Egypt,
Persia, Afghanistan and India from time
immemorial. Marco Polo mentions this
form of falconry in his story of his long
stay at the court of Kublai Khan, in
China, which began about 1275.
“U. Ralia”: When once camped near
Narrabri (N.S.W.), I caught two half-
grown wedgetail eagles. Their appear-
ance of being clothed in long white
trousers as they stalked about the camp
was highly amusing. When two years
old they were beautiful birds. Then the
male escaped from a large pen, spiralled
heavenwards, and alighted some few
yards away. I walked over, picked him
up by the points of his wings and put
him back into his prison without protest.
“Erne” will understand by this that I
have had some experience with the fowls.
* * * *
“Barwon”: “Windy” Wallace possessed
an unquenchable thirst and was an incor-
rigible match-cadger. Round the camp-
fire his “borrowing” was frowned upon.
Advice in blasphemous terms to make
use of a lighted stick to light his insani-
tary pipe went all unheeded by “Windy”
until one night “Cantering” Kelly handed
over his box with the remark that “there
was one in it.” Inserting a calloused
forefinger into the box “Windy” groped
until the infuriated “bulldog” imprisoned
therein got him. The “back-’un” “Windy”
performed was the best I’d seen up to
date; so was the fight that followed.
Kelly won in the tenth round.
* * * *
“A.G.T.”: At Ismailia (Egypt) a Digger
mate and myself saw three salmon gums,
trees of the Westralian wheatbelt and
eastern goldfields—and you don’t see
them anywhere else in Australia. They
appeared to be then (1917) about 40
years old, the largest being over 12in.
through. The trees made a fine showing
with their smooth salmon-tinted bark and
lustrous dark-green leaves alongside the
sombre-looking pines amid which they
were set.
* * * *
“Dunbar”: Two red polled bulls
started arguing the point through a wire
fence; when the barrier was a tangled
mass of wire and broken-off posts the
argument became more heated in the
one paddock. (It took me two days to
mend the fence.) They fought all day,
and their bellowing was heard through-
out the night. I found the old bull by
himself at the far end the run, Icpjt-
ing like a prize-fighter who had just lost
the championship ; he could hardly see,
and' his head was swollen to twice nor-
mal size. Evidently the absence of horns
on either side made the fight go a record
number of rounds.
* * * *
“Theine Dhu”: Jacky, a kooka., used
the top platform of a windmill as a look-
out tower for spotting mice and frogs in
the lucerne. By sitting with his head
hunched in his shoulders he could just
give clearance to the sails of the mill.
Unfortunately, after months of success,
he had his moment of forgetfulness, and
was neatly scalped as he raised his head.
Next day he was back, a wiser if balder
bird, sedately perched two feet lower
down.
* * * *
“Torquata”: What’s the size of the
biggest kurrajong? One growing near
Peak Hill (N.S.W.) has never been lopped,
but it lost one huge limb in a gale. The
trunk has a girth of lift, and a height
of 70ft. On one side the shade extends
36yds.; in the opposite direction, 18yds.
It is acclaimed the largest kurrajong seen
by much-travelled bushmen, and occupies
the sunny side of a hill in rich volcanic
soil.
* * * *
“Rindy”: Hanging from a counter
was a length of carpet, the end of the
cotton warps, knotted in tassels, just
touching the floor. Caught by the leg
in the tassels was a dead rat. Inquest
showed that a warp of the carpet had
got between its toes, the looping acting
as a snare. Every vestige of hair, skin
and flesh had been bitien off the leg of
the struggler in his efforts to free him-
self, whereas a mere nip at any part of
the cotton, or even the careful mani-
pulation of the foot, would have released
him. Evidently there are fool rats as well
as fool humans.
* * * *
“Monty”: Some devotee to Respect-
ability spoiled the effect of the abo.
demonstration on the Nullarbor Plain
by. making the warriors
and gins turn out to
welcome the Duke in
scanties. South Africa
had no such qualms
when it presented a cor-
roboree —or whatever it
is—of Zulu braves and
flappers au naturel —and
a splendid display it was,
judging by the movie
gazettes. It was only a
few years before the war
that the reigning King of
Greece visited a remote
riverside town, and on his
being led down for his
morning’s bath the local
mayor and aldermen,
who did the leading,
were scandalised to find
a bunch of local women
doing the week’s wash-
ing on the bank dressed
in nothing at all. Later
in the day the mayor
notified the girls that
during the king’s visit
this custom must cease,
and the following morn-
ing the king found them
all in old clothes, wet
and bedraggled. “Why,
ladies,” he asked, “are
you washing in this un-
comfortable fashion?”
They explained. “Offend
me? What rubbish!
Take them off.” And that they did
speedily as he strolled off, with a score
of husky Venuses giving three cheers for
the king.
* * * *
“De Bee”: Is there anything artists
draw so frightfully as an axe? The
shapeless head on the straight stick is
invariably seen in drawings, causing
many broad grins amongst chip-flyers of
the bush. Ignorance of such a common
tool seems strange to a son of the open
spaces. The artist evidently doesn’t boil
his kettle with wood.
* * * *
“Mr. Pincher”: Many sporting breeds
of dogs not bred for the purpose will
retrieve instinctively (B. 10/10/’34). As
a boy I had a foxy who would bring
a duck out of any water and run down a
“winger” swimming under water or a
running quail as well as any gun-dog
proper. I have a pure-bred foxy not 12
months old. A month or two ago I saw
him flopping among the plants in the
front garden, and got up in time to see
him take a budgerigar in his mouth. He
yielded the thing at once —a business it
sometimes takes retrievers and spaniels
some teaching—and the bird bit me so
shrewdly that I let it go involuntarily.
The pup recaptured it, and this time I
shoved it into a small aviary, where it
still is, as chirpy as half a dozen mates
who have never been “mouthed” by a
tyke.
’E OUGHTER TALK.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“ ’E oughter talk,” says Sam the cook, and
sharply jerks his tousled head,
When someone’s finished telling us what some-
body or other said.
A cryptic phrase perhaps in print, as cautious
as a miss in baulk,
But what expression Sam can throw into his
terse “ ’E oughter talk!”
It may be Lang whom someone quotes as
having made it clear and plain
All in the garden will be grand when he gets
into power again,
And how the spectre of the Dole no more
about the land will stalk.
“My oath!” says Sam with withering scorn,
“’E oughter talk, ’e oughter talk!”
Suppose some chap who’s never grilled a chop
or made a johnny-cake
Sniffs at the hash that Sam can sling or faults
the bread that Sam can bake,
You’ll never hear him go off pop, or lose his
block or stall or baulk;
The only comment he permits himself’s a crisp
“ ’E oughter talk!”
Old Sam, they say, once went to church —
a long, long time ago, I think —
And heard a preacher castigate the craze for
betting and for drink.
“Wot does ’e know ’oo never saw ’is fancy
winnin’ in a walk,
Or blew the bubbles off a pot?” growled Sam
next day. “’E oughter talk !”
“’E oughter talk!” A form of speech that
ever since suggests to me
Some wiseacre you’d hardly trust to know a
bull’s foot from a bee,
Or gold from mundic, shall we say? Or gems
from paste, or cheese from chalk.
Assuredly, as Sam would say in cynic mood,
“ ’E oughter talk!”
N.S.W.
PIPARDS.


“Eureka”: “That’s the worst of givin’
a job to a single bloke,” Dad told the
new farmhand, who had threatened to
leave if Dad spoke to him like that
again. “What’s wrong with a single
bloke, anyhow?” the offended one asked.
“Well, he gets the ’uff every time y’
growl at ’im,” Dad said. “A married
man takes it all as a matter o’ course.”
* * * *
“Skiamet” (Siam): “De M.” is right
about the sap of milky mangrove causing
blindness (B. 15/8/’34). My new Chinese
foreman had a gang of local Siamese
clearing a belt of this growth ; within a
few minutes his eyes were violently in-
flamed and closed up, and he was in
dreadful agony. An old hand on the
scene bathed the sore optics with cocoa-
nut oil, and the foreman was busy on
the job again within a couple of hours.
Local natives swear by this cure, main-
taining that it never fails if applied early.
Observation shows that only newchums
are affected.
* * * *
“I. Walton”: In the long ago I did
a bit of fishing that would make Zane
Grey look to his laurels. I took 12,000
new-shorn weaner wethers from the shed
to Bald Hills tank (Q.), and they waded
in as they drank. After a bit the surface
“Could they no ’ get ye in tha tin,
laddie?”
of that dam was dotted with gasping
bubbles which were the snouts of fish
fighting for breath. The yolk washed
from the fleeces of the wethers had cov-
ered the surface of the water with scum.
We all know how greasy sheep are, just
off shears. I and others with me chanced
the poisonous effect of the yolk which
suffocated the fish. We went in and took
those helpless fish by the hand and led
’em ashore. We passed our plates up
for the second helping, the third and a
bit over ; and, though I don’t doubt some
of the others have gone in the meantime,
I’m still on deck and smacking my lips
at the thought of that feed we got in
Bald Hills tank.
* * * *
“Coorparoo”: “Wandana’s” balloon-
fish (B. 19/9/’34) isn’t going to have it
all its own way as a tricky meal; I
hereby back my barramundi against it.
At the wild-fowl sanctuary at Mf. St.
John, Townsville (Q.), the other day, we
found a pelican dead as a nail at the
water’s edge. A twelve-pound barra-
mundi —alive, kicking and very fresh —
was fast in the fowl’s throat. It fur-
nished a delicious breakfast.
* * * *
“Theine Dhu”: Here’s a sport for
those who are tired of tickling trout and
forget their bait when yabbying. Wade
out with bare feet and a tin into 18in.
of yabby-infested water, then stand still.
Soon the crawlers come prospecting
round your toes for a meal. Slide the
hand down your leg till you make con-
tact, grasp the victim, and yank him out
and into the tin. It’s quite easy, and the
bait remains undamaged if the pests are
not too thick. Two Wimmera (Vic.)
youngsters showed me the trick.
* * * *
“Dalesman”: That crow-catching de-
vice in snowy weather (B. 10/10/’34) is
a very ancient poaching trick
in the North of England,
where partridges and grouse,
which always “pack” when
the shooting season is over,
are the objectives. As de-
scribed by the bird-
limed paper cone is shoved
into the snow and a couple
of grains of wheat dropped
into the bottom. The bird
dives after the wheat and is
nabbed. If the snow is deep
enough, the birdlime is cut
out, the cone is shoved fur-
ther down and the bird goes
after it. He cannot get back,
and his struggles shake the snow down
over him —an additional advantage,
since it hides the corpse from stickybeak
keepers.
* # i
“Redwing”: When Rewan horsebreed-
ing station (C.Q.) was thrown open
recently for selection, the horses were
sent by road to the Charleville saleyards.
Among the mob were two stallions that
had been stall-fed all their lives. They
refused to touch the natural grasses along
the route, and starved to death before
the drovers reached Charleville.
* * * *
“Fluffy”: Having looked at ’em for
many years I’m satisfied emus are devoid
of brains and staying power, and, except
in favored districts, are doomed. Fences
play the devil with ’em; in all the years
that have passed since the first sheep-
fence was built on their country, they
have not learned how to circumvent them.
They have one rule: Rush the thing
and trust to luck. Long legs entangled
in twitches of wire mean death every
time. And invariably when a dry pinch
comes the emus are the first to go under.
If a waterhole is fenced off they haven’t
the atom of brains needed to go round
the corner. They hang on a drying hole,
even though other water is a mile or
more away. It seems that the only thing
they have learned from the fences is that
they can’t get through ’em and that their
range is restricted. I’ve seen emus hang-
ing on a fence and on the point of perish-
ing when the wires had been drawn from
that fence and only the posts remained,
with water less than half a mile away.
Again, and finally, I refer to their insane
and suicidal habit of always crossing a
moving object. Though the world is
open to them on one side they will not
use that free getaway; they must race
the car, horse, whatever it is, and cross
in front of it before shooting away on
the opposite side.
* * * *
“J. 8.”: Taming and domesticating
the young native-bear isn’t uncommon,
but I’ve known only one instance of a
young cassowary becoming a member of
a human family and enthusiastically re-
fusing to leave it. The head of the house
was a pal of mine who had something
to do with a native school in Papua. The
little cass. used to come in with its
cobbers, the black kids, to the class
every day and sleep out the lesson-time.
When they marched in or out he was
at the head of the procession. Also,
he was at the top of the poll at
tucker-time. No game the children could
play that the bird didn’t have a hand in,
so to speak, and in a weird and whirling
form of football which they had evolved
for themselves he was Billy Wallace and
“Dally” Messenger rolled into one. To
see him make flying kicks at the ball
and hear him using the most awful
language in the scrum is a joyous
memory to me.
“Thanks all the same,
mate, but I’m not
goin’ your way.”
“Billy S e e”:
Whales are vocal
right enough.
Around Point
Cloates (W.A.) we
usually came on a
family group—bull,
cow and calf. The
Norwegian gunner
always shot the cow
fi rs t if possible.
When the harpoon
struck home she
would scream like 50 women. This
brought the bull in with a rush, and then
he got his medicine. The calf was
allowed to go, though the Norwegians
argued that it was wasted mercy, since
the lone youngster was certain to be
destroyed by killers before it learned to
fend for itself.
* * * *
“Porcupine Joe”: “O’Campbell’ (B.
26/9/’34) ought to have cleaned the ants
out of his porcupines, and then buried
the bodies for a day before he cooked
them. Treated thus, and then baked in
a camp-oven with some sage, onion and
breadcrumb stuffing, or in clay under hot
ashes, a young porci is as good as any
sucking-pig. Another tasty bush dish is
baked stuffed kangaroo-rat. Bandicoot,
less good, needs burial for 36 hours. A
foot deep in shaded loamy soil is best
—and watch the dogs! Picked up the
dodge from a German cook who, for the
first time —for me —made black swans
and native companions really attractive
food —he said that his fellow-clansmen in
Prussia treated geese that way.
“Erua”: Two of the most in-
teresting colored lakes in M.L.
are the Blue and Green Lakes,
shown to travellers who make
the trip from Rotorua to
Wairoa, the latter the village
that Tarawera devastated in
1886. Between the lakes is a
narrow ridge, and, while the
water on one side is a clear and
vivid blue, the second lake is
the color of pale jade. Chemi-
cal deposit is credited with the
tinting, except in local legend,
which solemnly asserts that an
old Irishwoman, washing on the
ridge, let her blue-bag slip into
the Blue Lake, whereupon she
collapsed with shock and her-
self slid down the opposite slope.
“Tatters”: Old Larry, ex-digger, green-
grocer, pig-fancier and bachelor, is a
local celebrity in our n.-w. N.S.W. town.
He and a rival trader have horses named
Maud. On passing, each pretends to be
ignorant of the other till Larry invariably
starts up with “Whoa, Maud!” at which
both horses stop dead. If the other has
taken his basket into a house there comes
a “Giddup, Maud!” and away plods the
rival’s nag, to be chased by a cursing
owner. There is always a row, but it
never comes to anything, and Larry
maintains his right to address his own
horse when and where he likes.
* * * *
“McA.”: Though the Maoriland bush-
man or traveller hasn’t the tick menace
to contend with in bracken, he also
avoids that pest for bed-making, particu-
larly if there is any mingi-mingi in the
vicinity. The wiry stems and small leaves
of this native ground-vine make a dry
and amazingly comfortable bush bed.
Cut and piled to a height of five feet
or so, with a rug on top, a mingi-mingi
bed has all the comfort-giving proper-
ties of the average spring mattress, and,
in the snakeless, antless and generally
pestless bush of M.L., with such a couch
a good night’s rest is assured.
“Scipio”: Can this
incident, which hap-
pen e d at Wagga
(N.S.W.), be paral-
leled anywhere else
outside Africa or
India? The citizens
of Wagga planted an avenue of poplar-
trees at the railway station by way of a
welcome to the Duke of Gloucester.
In the night a herd of elephants came
along and ate the darned lot. Of course,
the pachyderms were members of a visit-
ing circus, but the story reads more like
Uganda than the Riverina.
* * * *
“Lugger’s Mate”: Booby Island,
where the latest sampan has been cavort-
ing, was first seen by James Cook after
he had dragged his Endeavour past the
worst dangers of the Barrier Roof. He
called it Booby because of the clouds of
boobies (gannets). Only 164 years ago,
but none of the birds remain—a result
of civilisation —although thousands (boo-
bies, terns and the like) may be seen on
other islets, such as Raine, and the cays
of the Reef.
* * * *
“Barang”: A “Service” reply re ger-
mination of waratah seeds reminds me
of an old bushman’s method of raising
the plants from cuttings. Obtain a
freshly-cut flower and slit the base of
the stem for half an inch. In this slip
a grain of wheat, plant cutting in
a shady spot, and keep damp. Two years
ago I tried out 12 cuttings at Port Hack-
ing (N.S.W.); to-day all are thriving.
* * * *
“3130”: Queer accidents to birds (B.
26/9/’34)? It’s surprising how many
come to grief—especially large fowls —in
country telephone wires. I have seen an
eagle that evidently caught his leg in a
top wire. The sudden check swung him
right round till the foot caught in a wire
below, and he was held securely. After
flapping and struggling for half a day
he was still full of fight, and it took two
men the rest of the day to straighten out
the tangle. The wires were twisted
enough to be used as a hawser.
* * * *
“Kerys”: Add cicadas to the creatures
that have a puzzling habit of stopping
“as if electrocuted” (B. 10/10/’34). The
starting all together is comprehensible
on the theory that they begin in chorus
in response to some signal imperceptible
to human ears ; but what makes them all
stop at once, with never a note trailing
after the general chorus, has all amateur
entomologists beaten. It can scarcely be
a sound signal; nothing short of a rifle
shot would pierce the hubbub they make
when all hands are musically engaged.
* * * *
“R.W.D.”: “Bitter Bark” (B. 26/9/’34)
needn’t anticipate a cyclone every season
that the mango-tree has a scanty crop.
The tree puts forth new wood and leaves
one year and gets down to business of
fruit-producing the next, and so on.
Sometimes a wet year will cause every
fruit to fall off when very small, but
beyond coincidence there’s no foundation
for the superstition that coming events
cast their shadows upon the mango or
any other tree.
PESTS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
If you lump them all together, flood and fire
and droughty weather,
They are just a part and parcel of the game.
We can keep our self-possession through a
tropical depression,
And we’d tolerate a cloudburst if it came;
For the seasons always vary, good or fair or
just contrary,
But the pests keep on increasing just the
same.
You will always find the rabbits, with the same
voracious habits;
There are mice who’re ever busy in the hay;
There are wombats who politely root your
netting fences nightly;
And the caterpillars often come to stay,
Till you sometimes pause to wonder, as you
fight them for their plunder,
Who would feed them if you ever went
away?
Then there’s bracken always growing, with its
fresh-curled frondlets showing,
And there’s thistledown adrift on every wind;
While the blackberries are creeping through the
grasses while you’re sleeping,
And the flaring ragwort isn’t hard to find;
And the weeds suck out the profit that you
hoped to gather off it
As the fernhook and the mattock fall behind.
Still you’ve got to grin and bear it, but the
wife who ought to share it
Gives you still another morsel to digest;
When the peaceful evening’s going, and your
pipe is bravely glowing,
She will tell you—and it’s useless to protest—
To put collar, tie and all on, for you’re going
out to call on
Some poor, weary, hard-worked neighbor—
what a pest!

ON THE LAND'S
PAGE
THE
STUFF TO GIVE 'EM
MEGGITT'S LINSEED MEAL
CLASSING LAMBS’ WOOL.
“Lion”: When classing either merino
or crossbred lambs’ wool, the main prin-
ciples to follow are:
Always class scrupulously according to
length. A difference of 1-in. makes a
big difference in price.
Keep all burry wool out of the two
top lines irrespective of length, unless
there is burr right through the clip. This
wool should be either made into a line
on its own, or put into the lowest line.
Make the pickers-up lay each fleece
in a separate heap. This gives a better
chance of keeping up with a fast shearing
team. It also helps to keep the wool
clean.
See that the board is continually swept,
all sweepings minus dags, etc., going into
the lowest line. Three lines for the best'
of lambs are enough, unless you make
one line of free wools and one of burry
or seedy sorts.
When classing, lift the wool and shake
it at the same time —light-handedly. This
allows you to see the length easily and
also prevents dirt and lower lines from
becoming mixed up with the tops, as
always happens if wool is not properly
shaken.
If a crossbred lamb’s wool is of the
hairy type, but of fair length, pull it out
of the top line, and the next as well if
it is at all short.
Put everything else into the lowest line,
except stained, after the first two have
been picked out.
WOOL TYPES.
“Trepex”: The proposal of “Dead
Finish” (B. 3 /10 / ’34) to grade rams and
show sheep as 64’s type, 70’s type and
so on possibly would be all right if there
were any guarantee that the fleece would
be of the same spinning quality all over.
Unfortunately, such an occurrence is
rare. I have seen the breech end of
sheep from a N.S.W. stud showing wool
a good two qualities coarser than the
shoulder; and I knew one man with a
good flock which had this divergence so
marked that he systematically had his
fleeces broken in two and the end
classed separately.
Evenness of quality is, of course, a big
factor, and point's are awarded for it in
judging, but no judge expects a uniform
standard. He usually makes a close
general approximation. Thus, a ram’s
fleece may be a 66’s on the shoulder and
sides, but only a 60’s on the breech, neck
folds and points. It would be correct to
call it a “medium-wool” ram, but it
would be misleading to call it a 64’s type.
After all, the terms 60’s, 64’s, 70’s,
etc., are borrowed from the manufac-
turer. A 64’s top will spin 64 hanks of
yarn, each 560 yards long, from one
pound of the top, not from the pound
of wool. A 64’s wool will make such a
top, but to stretch the term to cover a
class of a sheep is going too far.
“Fine,” “medium” and “strong,”
applied to merino stud types, are good
terms, sufficiently comprehensive and dis-
criminatory.
One does not look for really fine wool
from a ram; it is his progeny which
counts. If all the fleeces from all the
fine-woolled rams in Australia were
packed into one lot and sold as such,
probably they might be bought for a
60’s top—certainly for nothing better
than a 64’s. For one thing, length would
be against it. Types on the sheep's back
and types in the bale should not be too
far confused.
DIP, JET, CRUTCH AND BREED.
“Jass”: As I see it, the problem is to
keep down the number of both flies and
strikes.
Many assume that this first half of the
job is the more important, which pre-
supposes that all sheep are equally sus-
ceptible. This is wrong.
I maintain that the man who puts up
the best fight against fly is he who realises
the futility of trapping to destroy a few
thousands out of tens of millions, and
directs his efforts towards making his
sheep unattractive to the pests. Dipping,
jetting and crutching all help, but breed-
ing to produce sheep with a plain breech
is the best bet.
Miss Mary Fuller, after 4| years’ study
for the C.5.1.R., has established that the
increase of flies is controlled by the flies
themselves. The food supply never
catches up with the demand, and com-
petition ensues in which the maggots of
one kind of fly devour those of another.
Burial or burning of carcasses upsets
this natural balance, and even where suc-
cess seems to attend efforts to destroy
flies it is possible that the variety re-
sponsible for strike escape and are freed
from the competition of their natural
enemies. Each stage of decomposition of
a carcass attracts a particular variety,
and destruction of a carcass without a
proper understanding of the succession
defeats its own object.
A blowfly dressing for struck sheep
recommended by the Queensland Agri-
tultural Department is:
40 p.c. fuel oil (Dieselene or similar),
55 p.c. shark, whale or cod-liver oil.
5 p.c. cresylic acid,
0.1 p.c. sodium arsenite, or lib. per
100 gallons.
First, add the sodium arsenite to the
fish oil, and, after shaking well, add the
cresylic acid ; lastly, the fuel oil. Shake
occasionally when using.
“G.F.D.”: On September 13 out on
the S.W.R. in Queensland we dipped
over 1000 lambs three months old. I
mustered them a fortnight later and
dressed a 50 p.c. strike. The majority
were in a bad way, and another few
days would have seen heavy losses.
Practically all the lambs were blown
in the crutch—ewes and wethers alike—
yet all were dipped in arsenical-powder
dip of correct strength. We made sure
each one was done properly.
The ewes with which the lambs are
running show about a 3 p.c. strike.
Flytraps, advocated by “Maggoty” (B.
26/9/’34), are nob worth the trouble of
making.
There were many traps all over
Queensland, but after an experiment with
one which I tended for 12 months for
the Government the veterinary ento-
mologist pronounced them a failure
owing to the fact that the percentage of
“primary striking” flies caught was
negligible.
I’ve seen flytraps all over a run,
but when warm, muggy weather followed
a couple of inches of rain all hands and
the cook were out maggoting, and the
flytraps were emptied every day.
The best flytrap is a piece of meat
soaked in strong arsenic solution and
hung in a tree or a post in the sheep-
yards. I’ve seen them with dead flies
inches deep round them, but haven't
noticed any diminution in the number
of flies round the maggoty sheep.
LOUSY WOOL.
“R. E. Combing”: I classed a clip out
west in N.S.W. recently on which the
owner was losing from 2d. to 3d. per
pound and anything from l|lb. to 21b. in
weight per head through having lousy
sheep.
Woolgrowers should realise that not
only is health taken out of the skin by
the vermin and the general condition of
the animal impaired, but that, in rubbing
itself against logs and fences to ease its
torments, the jumbuck spoils his covering.
The wool fibres become twisted out of
parallel and the whole fleece may be-
come a tangled mat.
It must be remembered that the pro-
portion of noils has a big bearing on
price. The bigger the tangle, the more
noils.
Western N.S.W. growers will have to
realise that dipping is as necessary to
them as to their brothers from the hills.
Now is the time to think of it.
COUNTING SHEEP.
“Valerin”: I am not impressed by
flash methods. Slow and sure is good
enough for the man who wants accuracy.
Though in counting only practice
makes perfect, anyone who counts by
threes should rarely make a mistake.
Impress on the tallyman that he must
call plainly the number for each 100,
making a small nick in the tally-stick—
a large one for each 1000.
When the mob is half through, re-
move those counted to another yard.
Should a dispute arise later it saves count-
ing the whole lot again.
SPONTANEOUS COMBUSTION.
“Dead Finish”: That bugbear of a
bygone era “spontaneous combustion”
in wool has died a natural death. The
old-time grower had an unholy fear of
baling-up wool that was at all damp. It
was the custom years ago to stop shearers
working on damp sheep for fear of
trouble after the wool had been baled.
Now the procedure is reversed—the
barbers knock off themselves, and de-
mand days of drying.
Within limits, this is reasonable, as
handling wet sheep and wool has un-
pleasant effects. The grower benefits by
the delay also, as wool pressed in a damp
condition opens up unattractively.
The only portion of the clip that' will
generate much heat when stacked is the
line usually branded Stained Pieces, es-
pecially those from coarse crossbreds and
English breeds. This is attributable to
the chemical action of the urine, in com-
bination with the dampness in a confined
area, but it is never enough to fire. What
will blaze, though, is the jute pack the
wool is pressed into. The old-time car-
rier found, if his load was not properly
twitched, that friction from continual
chafing would start a blaze ; more readily
if the packs were damp. In all proba-
bility this same chafing was the cause of
fires in the holds of the windjammers
of yesteryear, and not the wool itself.
Nowadays, wool is dumped before load-
ing into vessels, and forced into place by
means of jacks, thereby eliminating any
possibility of friction.
ANTHRAX PRECAUTIONS.
“H.U.C.”: Supplementing “Beefo’s”
remarks (B. 15/8/’34), all animals that
have been in contact with an anthrax
victim should be inoculated with reliable
vaccine by a licensed inoculator.
If the carcass of an anthrax victim has
to be moved for burying, chloride oi
lime or a thick layer of unslaked lime
should be placed over the track along
which it is moved.
BLACK SOIL AND FIXTURES.
“Sprinkler”: “Maggoty” relies on
theory when he says (B. 26/9/’34) that
iron dips would be impracticable in
W.Q. owing to the black soil swelling
after rain. He adds: “Our fencing-posts
are raised out of the ground from the
same cause, and have to be periodically
resunk.” By black soil I presume he
means loose downs country. There is no
class of earth which is more responsive
to swelling after rain.
During TB, iron cattle dips were put
in at Lake Nash and Austral Downs
(Barkly Tableland). That at Austral was
sunk in earth which was like an ash-bed,
for about 4ft. down. The rest was in
solid rock, which would add to the dis-
tortion of the earth on top. Both those
dips are still doing duty without warping.
I don’t think anything has been spent on
their maintenance.
I know fences in every part of W.Q.
Some have been up over 50 years. The
posts have never been resunk, and look
as if they won’t need resinking* for an-
other 50 years. A post is always put in
larger end downwards. With the big
end down, the swelling of the earth
has the opposite tendency to that which
“Maggoty” claims: it sucks the post
down more tightly.
But if “Maggoty” refers to iron posts
or stakes with sharpened ends he is right.
Even in tight soil, with a 20in. rainfall,
a stake will be lifted out of the ground
in two wet seasons.
LUCERNE HAY V. ITS ENSILAGE.
“Spring”: A golden rule is “Never
make ensilage when you can make hay.”
The former costs more to make and is
usually worth less as fodder.
If “Lucerne” (B. 3/10/’34) treats a
first cut of alfalfa full of barley grass
and natural grasses as follows, he should
meet with success:
Overstock the paddock from the time
the barley grass starts to grow, and eat
it down well. Then remove the sheep
before the lucerne crown gets damaged.
It may be necessary to eat down again.
This makes the b.g. as harmless as pos-
sible, for little remains.
Now, cut as soon as the hay will
make. To retain the sweet flavor it must
be stacked without rain, and with a little
heat. This makes carting easier, for
there is no need to wait until the sap has
gone out of the stems.
Undue heating of the stack can be
prevented as follows: Get two or more
bags of chaff, and sit them upright on the
ground and spaced in the middle line of
the stack, taking the distance from one end.
Build the stack in the ordinary way,
taking care to press the hay well around
the bags. As soon as the level reaches
the top of the bags, pull them up half
their height only, and proceed until the
stack is built. If the bags have been
correctly placed from the start, they
should come out exactly in the ridge of
the stack, leaving a perfect vent which is
covered with two sticks and hay on top
of them. It is best not to make the
stacks of first cuts too big—say 30 feet
long by 15 feet wide.
I have practised this method for years,
and have never had a failure or a fire.
ENSILAGE MORTALITY.
“Valerin”: Reports of stock loss after
feeding on ensilage need not disturb stock-
owners. Properly cured silage is never

injurious. I have fed it for years and
cannot remember losing a hoof. The
silage should be packed in the pit to ex-
clude air and obtain the right tempera-
ture and fermentation. The finished pit
should be at once securely sealed and
covered with earth.
Failure to observe these rules promotes
fungus growths and mould, which will
set up inflammation of the bowels and
other intestinal troubles in stock.
To get best results, ensilage should be
fed before stock begin to lose condi-
tion. Feeding should extend over as long
a period of the day as possible. Scatter
the fodder well, give plenty of water and
salt and feed in a fresh place each day.
MEASURING DRENCHES.
“H.U.C.”: Serious errors often result
from the hotch-potch of weights and
measures at present in use for dealing
with veterinary drugs and drenches. The
ordinary pint of 13oz. may be confused
with the imperial pint of 20oz.
For measuring powders and solids,
the apothecaries’ table is used:
60 grains equals 1 dram
8 grams equals 1 oz.
12 oz. equals 1 lb.
Thus loz. equals 480 grains, as in troy
weight, but in avoirdupois it equals only
grains.
For liquids, use the following mea-
sure :
60 minims (drops) equals .. 1 dram
8 drams equals 1 oz.
20 oz. equals 1 pint
8 pints equals 1 gallon
The following are some rough equiva-
lents of common utensils:
1 dessertspoonful equals .. 3to 4 drams
1 tablespoonful equals .. }to 1 oz.
1 eggcupful equals to H oz.
1 cupful (small) equals .. sto 7 oz.
1 cupful (large) equals .. Bto 11 oz.
1 tumblerful (aver.) equals \ imp. pint
In dealing with poisonous drugs, these
rough measures are not accurate enough.
For percentages, mixing liquids with
liquids, 1 p.c. equals 1 fluid oz. in 5
imperial pints; mixing solids with
liquids, 1 p.c. equals 4\ grains of solid
to loz. of liquid.
HINTS ABOUT TOMATOES.
“Hortus”: The reason for many
failures in tomato-growing is that
growers do not look after their seedlings
carefully enough. Spray with Bordeaux
mixture, otherwise losses are bound to
come through “damping-off” and early
blight.
Small growers should plant their seed-
lings in rows in the hot frames. It gives
them more room to develop, and also
allows of a little cultivation in the early
stages.
A common mistake is over-watering
young plants. This can be reduced
greatly by inter-cultivation and mulch-
ing.
Where the seed has been sown heavily,
and shows good germination, the plants
should be thinned out immediately they
are up.
In N.S.W. last year transplanting gave
many growers trouble. It is a delicate
operation. Aim at having the soil just
loose enough to let the plants put out
new roots, and use only a slight dressing
of super., if any. Experienced growers
usually let 14 days elapse after trans-
planting before exposing the seedlings to
the sun for the whole day.
In seed-beds plants at the back are apt
to lean to the light, and grow at an angle.
This can be easily prevented by white-
washing the back of the bed. The sun’s
rays will then be reflected on to the rear
plants, enabling them to make the same
growth as those in front.
A successful tomato-grower advocates
the following points when preparing soil
for planting tomatoes. Plough five inches
deep, then lime and harrow. Plough
twice more, and give three harrowings.
Make rows 4ft. apart, and plants 2ft.
apart in rows. Before planting, fertilise
with super, and blood-and-bone mixture
—l3cwt. per acre. After the first fruit
has set, add 601 b. of amm. sulph. Have
your plot on a hillside with a northerly
aspect.
Growing on a small scale, I have found
it best to put the plants in beds of two
rows slightly raised to allow of paths
between.
A bad mistake is again over-watering
in early stages. A trench should be made
between the two rows of plants, and filled
with rotted cow manure and ashes from
wood fires. The water is not applied to
the plants, but put' into the trench, which
after a while can be dug in, and a fresh
supply of manure added. The plants
need this extra food and water after
first fruit has set.
BEES AND SPRAYS.
“Coolabah”: At the last conference
of the N.S.W. Fruitgrowers’ Association
the need to enforce the protection of
wild bees’ nests in fruit-growing areas
was stressed.
Millions of bees, wild and otherwise,
are destroyed in fruit-growing areas
through the use of toxic sprays, and,
while it is admitted that spraying is essen-
tial, consideration should be given from
the bees’ point of view.
The bee is an insect that is absolutely
influenced by sense of smell, but the
odor of certain well-known chemicals has
much the same effect on it as water on a
booze hog.
If growers were to insist on the addi-
tion of an ingredient objectionable to
the pollinators’ nose the trouble would
be obviated. The bees would have plenty
of time to do their job between spray-
ings. Failing some such measure the
orchardist is going to lose his best' ally,
for the use of the spray gun is becoming
more essential every day.
MORE ABOUT NOOGOORA.
“Nedos”: This curse of the Flinders
(N.Q.) country is fast gaining the upper
hand on all stations adjoining the river.
Sometimes it grows 6ft. high. When dry
the pods cling to the wool of the sheep or
drop to the ground, where they start new
growth.
Inside the pod are two distinct seeds,
the second germinating a year later
than the first. Graziers along the river
have men constantly employed burr-
pulling, but do not seem to be making
any headway.
Can any reader advise a good method
of getting rid of it?
HINTS FOR THE FARM.
“Billy See”: When putting in bolts
which may have to be taken out again,
and in the meantime will be exposed to
the weather, washer-up so that no por-
tion of the thread projects beyond the
head of the nut. Such bolts will always
unscrew easily.
“Valerin”: Cereal growers should
keep a close watch in their crops for
hatching ’hoppers. Mrs. ’Hopper chooses
a bare surface to lay her eggs on, and
fallow land just seeded is ideal for her.
As soon as the youngsters are able to
climb the growing plants it will be hard
to dislodge them. They can do a lot of
damage in a short time.
“Sandy”: Cement, lime and super,
users should wash sore hands in warm
water with sugar added at the rate of
one teaspoon to the cup. This takes the
irritation out of the creases and prevents
cracking.
“Wrash”: Lateral branches on wattle
seedlings should be trimmed off and the
trees made to grow with a long limbless
trunk. Then when stripping time comes
the strips of bark can be peeled from
bottom to top without felling or climb-
ing. Always strip after rain.
“Bill R.”: The draughts through a
slab wall can be stopped by filling the
cracks with mortar well mixed with
short, clipped horsehair. Floor cracks
can be caulked with strips of rag smeared
with beeswax. If you haven’t a caulking
iron use a blunt butcher’s knife and a
light hammer.
“Whalebone”: Always boil or roast
kangaroo, wallaby or rabbit for the dogs.
They like it better cooked, and it will
not give them worms, as fresh meat may.
“A.G.T.”: An old waterbag makes
a handy nailbag. Cut a slit in one side
and two holes in the top corners to pass
a strap through.

He entered a secluded little cottage by

should attire themselves in those hateful
costumes, and muttering that it was a
blot on civilisation and shouldn’t be
allowed, he stripped off. Then, running
blithely into the backyard, he joined his

THIS MARRIAGE PROBLEM.
The solution of the great problem of
domestic unrest has been discovered. I
have discovered it! True, it may be said
that I do not enjoy domestic felicity ;
but that is only because I made my dis-
covery too late. We all do.
Let every man, when marrying, marry
a star actress. The result will be happi-
ness.
The average woman simply hates cook-
ing, and grumbles about that and other
“Better put me down now, darling—the ship will be starting soon.”
household duties until she makes her
husband miserable—unless he stays at
the club to avoid listening to her on the
subject. It is different with actresses.
For instance, an actress who has
just arrived in Sydney told the press that
she could not stay in a hotel, as she liked
to do her own cooking and'have her own
flat to look after. She is merely typical
of other actresses. They all love the
domestic arts, adore babies, and revel
in the things that make the average wife
grumble.
It is true that there may not be enough
actresses to go round. But if the men
only stood firm the women would be
forced to become actresses in order to
get married. Even if they only became
actresses to the extent of loving those
household duties it would be something.
My friend Bloggs has just dropped in
and, after looking at this, he has thrown
his usual spanner into the works.
He says that all women are actresses
to that extent before they are married.

THE EPIDEMIC.
Henry’s wife burst into the hall to
relieve him of his hat and coat.
“Too marvellous, darling,” she ex-
plained excitedly, “the Frith-Perkinses
aren’t coming to dinner after all. They
just ’phoned to say they had the ’flu and
wouldn’t like us to catch it too. So we
can use the two complimentaries for the
Wurlitzerium that you got yesterday.”
“Had yesterday,” amended Henry
glumly.
“Had?”
“Gave ’em to young Smythe this morn-
ing. Told him you had the ’flu.”
“But I haven’t.”
“I know.”
“And it’s a simply wonderful show,”
said Henry’s wife through grim lips. She
answered the ’phone, and as the one-
sided conversation finished a frown and
grimace belied the honeyed remarks sent
over the wire.
“I’ve always said you were a fool,
Henry,” she announced, replacing the
receiver on its hook. “That was Amelia
Smythe, and she’s got the ’flu properly.
Actually croaked like a frog. They gave
our Wurlitzerium tickets a couple of
hours ago to the Frith-Perkinses, who
said they had nothing important on and
accepted gladly.”
“I can only hope Frith-Perkins and
his wife get ’flu at the pictures,” said
Henry gloomily.
But they didn’t, though Henry and his
wife had it themselves within 48 hours.
Which, as the second-hand car sales-
man remarked, only goes to show you.
J. B. C.
SUSPENSE!
He shuddered involuntarily as the
rope with the sinister-looking noose
dangled before his eyes. So the time
had come at last, inexorably, inevitably!
As he glanced up at the hateful beams
the rope swung gently, and as it lightly
touched his neck he broke out in a
clammy sweat.
And now, despite his previous deter-
mination to face it out gamely, a wild
thought flashed through his brain to
make a sudden dash to get away—as far
away from that noose as he could. But
cold reason extinguished that nebulous
hope almost at its birth. Against it all
his instincts revolted. He would go with
an air of defiance, even though desire of
life was strong within him, and to leave
the earth in such a manner!
Then, with jaw set and a contemp-
tuous glance at the few officials and
others looking on with what he accounted
a morbid interest, he stepped forward
with firm tread, arranged the noose and,
giving the signal to the crane-driver up
on the tenth floor, started off on his first
“solo” trip aloft as a dogman.

FORCE OF HABIT.
The manager threw down the slip of
paper he had been reading, swore luridly,
and turned to his assistant.
“Well!” he said, “of all the hide!
Here’s one of our employees demanding
—demanding, mind you!—a month off
on full pay so that he can help some
friends of his to land a job. Did you
ever hear the like? Who is he, and
where does he come from?”
“Oh! that’ll be that new chap Blobb.
He did that for years in his last job, and
it was never questioned. He’s an ex-
M.L.A.”

“Elephants escaped from a circus ate an
avenue of poplars planted for the Prince.”
To elephants, a prince is but
A passing thing of small import,
And if within this Vale of Tears
You stayed for several hundred years,
You too might feel inclined to turn
To matters of a graver sort.
They took the courtesy, and showed
That they appreciated it.
They simply hadn’t heard a thing
About the Prince’s visiting;
It really was unfortunate
Their visit antedated it.

PEEPS AT THE PROFESSIONS.
IX.— THE CLOWN.
Who would be a circus clown,
On show in ev’ry country town
And laughed at by the locals,
Bruised and shaken ev’ry night
To bring two bobs’ worth of delight
To pleasure-seeking yokels?
Scorned by his children and his wife,
He leads a most unhappy life
From the first night he clowns until
His name is taken off the bill.
The clown is rapidly dying out, and
no wonder, considering the life he leads.
He is beaten, knocked down, slapped and
otherwise ill-treated every day and night
of his professional career. To make
matters worse, he gets no sympathy for
it. On the contrary he is laughed at
and his misfortunes are ridiculed. If he
looks sad people laugh. If he sobs they
scream with amusement. If he weeps
they go off into paroxysms of laughter.
Of course, he gets some laughs from
being funny ; but very few.
It is traditional that a clown is always
at his best, his funniest, when his wife
or child is dying. Unscrupulous managers
often take advantage of this. If a clown
seems a bit off color it is arranged for
him to receive a message just as he goes
in to do his turn. “Sorry,” says the
manager, hat in hand, “but your wife has
been killed in a motor accident.”
The clown gives a low moan, enters
the ring and proceeds to give the per-
formance of his life. His heart is break-
ing, but the show must go on. After
this ruse has been employed a few times
the clown begins to get suspicious.
“Bunk,” he replies; “she said she
wouldn’t be going out to-night.” The
manager then plays his trump card. “She
was going to get the doctor for your
little boy,” he explains. “It’s terribly
sad. She might have saved him.” The
brave old clown, grinning through his
tears, surpasses all previous records.
A clown’s home life must be very dis-
heartening to him. If he attempts to
amuse his small daughter he is told to
“stop clowning”;
while his brightest
wisecrack merely
brings from his son
the remark “Huh!
Y’ think you’re
funny, don’t y ’?”
This wouldn’t be so
bad if only his wife
could see a joke, but
she is invariably
devoid of a sense of
humor. “I brought
the house down
to-night,” he remarks proudly at supper-
time.
“Really, George, you should be more
careful,” she replies.
It is hard to say where clowns come
from or where they go to. All clowns
are middle-aged. One never sees a young
clown or an old clown.
Probably the prospective clown is
caught young and immured in a training
school, where he serves a long appren-
ticeship, cut off from communion with
his fellow-men, until he is middle-aged
enough to make his first appearance. This
would account for the age of most of
their jokes. But surely they don’t all
die middle-aged? They are such un-
happy people that they are almost cer-
tain to live to ninety.
There must be an aged-clowns’ retreat
somewhere, whither they go when their
circus days are over, to spend their de-
clining years pondering the works of
the philosophers.
All clowns are philosophers at heart.
JASBY.
FINALE.
“This is the end!” she cried in woe.
“The gods are pitiless! After this,
Bearing a burden that well I know,
I’ll say a long farewell to bliss.
Soon will the terrible night watch, filled
With a weary and wakeful grief, begin.
So this is the end!” she cried —and
swilled
The final drop in the flask of gin.

Information Sought.
(1) What was the longest boxing contest on
record ? (2) Have any ring encounters ended
inside a minute ? —3884.
(1) The drawn fight between Andy Bowen
and Jack Burke, 110 rounds (7hr. 19min.),
at New Orleans on April 20, 1884. (2) Yes,
many. A 1 Foreman knocked out Ruby Levine
in seconds at Montreal on April 25, 1928;
Battling Nelson beat Willie Rosner in 2 seconds
at Harvey, 111., on April 5, 1902; and Jack
Dempsey finished Fred Fulton in 8 seconds at
Harrison, N.J., on July 27, 1918*
(1) How to become a marine wireless oper-
ator ? (2) Approximate cost? (3) Duration
of course ? (4) Chances of employment ?
3780.
(1) Write to the Marconi School of Wireless,
97 Clarence-street, Sydney, for particulars of
the Marine Operator’s Course. (2) 50 guineas;
payable 10 guineas deposit and 3 guineas a
month. (3) 12 months by correspondence and
about 6 months’ practical tuition at the school.
(4) Very fair at present, owing to many opera-
tors being absorbed into air services.
Can interior decorating be studied in
Sydney ? If not, how could I gain knowledge
and experience in this work ? —3862.
It is necessary to attend art classes to obtain
a grounding in the composition and balance
of colors, perspective and design. Further
studies embracing period architecture, furniture
and textiles are usually obtained from private
teachers, or from a course of supervised read-
ing, supplemented by visits to museums and
collections. Art training can be obtained from
the East Sydney Technical College, Darling-
hurst, or a course in interior decoration may
be obtained from the Society of Arts and Crafts
of N.S.W., 8 Rowe-street, Sydney. Most success-
ful decorators are trained artists.
I want to use sulphur to fumigate a room
infested with vermin. How should I go about
it ?— 3952.
First paste over all openings and cracks with
paper. Place the sulphur—Boz. to every 1000
cub. ft. of space—moistened with methylated
spirits, in an iron bowl. Stand the bowl in a
large dish of water and set fire to the sulphur.
Leave the room immediately, and block any
cracks in the door from the outside. Leave
for several hours, and then thoroughly air.
The fumes will tarnish metalwork and tend
to bleach fabrics.
How to get rid of fleas in the house ? —3790.
Have a thorough spring-cleaning, using car-
bolic or phenol in water for washing floors.
Then spray or slop kerosene from a rag
into all floor crevices, behind skirtings,
etc. Sprinkle Epsom salts under carpets,
or use powdered naphthalene freely about
the house. It is necessary to keep up
the treatment for a few weeks to destroy
newly-hatched insects: their breeding-grounds
are dusty floor-cracks and crevices. Petrol can
be used for cleaning mats and rugs of these
vermin, but beware of its inflammability.
How to determine the latitude of any point
on the globe ? —3794.
The method most used by navigators and
travellers is, by means of a sextant, to observe
the meridian altitude of a star whose declina-
tion from the equator is known; or of the
sun, whose declination may be found at any
time from the Nautical Almanac; the sum or
difference (according to the direction of the
declination) of the altitude of the equator,
which is the co-latitude when subtracted from
90 degrees, leaves the latitude.
(1) What gauges are used by railways in the
British Isles? (2) What is the fastest speed of
the trains in Ireland? —3738.
(1) The constructors of the first railways in
Great Britain adopted the tramroad gauge, 4ft.
B£in., but in 1838 Brunei determined upon a
7ft. gauge for the G.W.R. In 1843 the Great
Eastern opened with a sft. gauge. The Cale-
donian gauge was sft. 6in., and in Ireland there
were two gauges, sft. 2in. and 6ft. The broad
and narrow English gauges met at Gloucester,
and it was necessary to transfer from one set
of carriages to another. At a later period
the G.W.R. laid a third rail to accommodate
narrow-gauge trains. In 1846 the 4ft. B£in.
gauge was made standard by law for all new
fines in Great Britain, and sft. 3in. in Ireland,
but as this law did not apply to the lines already
constructed the G.W.R. maintained its broad
gauge until 1892. (2) The G.N.R. of Ireland
has one train scheduled to cover 8.2 miles in
9min., or 54.7 m.p.h.
I have received a dentist’s bill which l con-
sider exorbitant. What redress have I ? —3883.
Write to the dentist saying that you consider
the charges excessive. If you receive no satis-
faction, write to the Dental Board of N.S.W.,
Chief Secretary’s office, 121 Macquarie-street,
Sydney. If the board declines to intervene
you can allow the dentist to sue you and
dispute the account, calling expert evidence to
show that the charges are excessive.
(1) Action of the zinc and sulphuric acid in
accumulators and batteries ? (2) Is sulphuric
acid used for reconditioning run-down car
accumulators ? (3) Difference between batteries
used for telephone and telegraph operation and
those used in motor-cars ? —3582.
(1) Zinc is not employed in accumulators.
In primary batteries, the zinc plate is attacked
by the sulphuric acid, zinc sulphate being
formed and hydrogen gas being given off. If
the zinc plate be connected externally to a
copper plate (also immersed in the acid) by a
length of wire a current of electricity will flow
from the copper plate, through the wire, to the
zinc plate. Thus, the energy made available
by the interaction of zinc and acid appears in
the form of electrical energy which causes
a current to flow. (2) This is a job for the
accumulator service station. Acid should not,
normally, be added to the cell. Distilled water
is used for making up evaporation losses. (3)
Chiefly, one of current output. A car battery
must be able to supply a heavy current for a
short period, whereas telegraph and telephone
instruments require small currents over con-
siderable periods.
(1) Most suitable woods for the manufac-
ture of radio cabinets ? (2) Where obtainable ?
(3) Where can 1 obtain further information ?
3828.
(1) Usually veneered plywood, walnut, maple
or rosewood surfaced, is used. (2) Leopold,
Barnett and Co., 113 York-street, or Knight,
306 Pitt-street, Sydney. (3) Any book on
cabinet-making will supply useful hints.
(1) Is there any basis of fact in the story
that one of Schumann’s delusions towards the
end was that Schubert was haunting him,
begging him to complete the “Unfinished Sym-
phony” ? (2) What form did Schumann’s
madness take ? (3) Did any other great com-
posers die insane ? —3941.
(1) No. The “Unfinished” had not been
performed when Schumann died, and he never
saw the score. (2) Delusions of persecution;
a continual ringing in his ears of the note A;
a desperate endeavor to get into touch with
the great dead composers, particularly Beet-
hoven, through spiritualistic seances. He be-
lieved that the last musical theme he penned
was communicated to him by spirits. (3) Insane
is a harsh term. It is kinder to say that a
mental breakdown preluded the deaths of
Edward MacDowell, Smetana (whose “Bartered
Bride” overture is often heard) and Hugo Wolf,
the song-writer.
How to make gesso paste ? —3830.
Four ounces carpenter’s glue, \oz. boiled lin-
seed-oil, %oz. ordinary varnish and loz. or so of
whiting. Dissolve the glue in water, stirring
it over a very gentle heat until it reaches the
consistency of thin syrup. Add the varnish
and then the boiled linseed-oil, slowly stirring
well all the time. Sieve the whiting through
gauze and add a very little at a time until the
mixture forms into a thin paste. Try it on a
smooth surface from time to time until it will
hold a shape and not spread of its own accord.
Pour it Into a jar of some sort while still warm
and seal tightly when cold.
Recipe for horehound beer ? —3726.
Boil together for \\ hour 10 quarts water,
2oz. whole ginger, 21b. brown sugar, 2\oz.
hops, i breakfast cup golden syrup, 3 good
sprigs or more of horehound, and 1 dandelion
root. Strain and cool in a tub, then add \ cup
yeast. Let it stand for two days; then skim
well and bottle. Tie the corks well.
Recipes for (1) fly and mosquito destroyer;
(2) cream for polishing linoleum; (3) furni-
ture polish ? —3809.
(1) Mix together 1 part kerosene, 2 parts
turpentine and a small quantity of oil of
pennyroyal; spray affected rooms with a small
hand-sprayer. (2) and (3) 4oz. beeswax, loz.
curd (white) soap, 1 pint turpentine and 1
pint of water which has been boiled. Pare
the wax and soap finely into a tin, cover with
the turpentine and let stand all night, or until
dissolved. Then add the water, cold. Bottle
and shake up well until it is white and creamy.
Apply with a flannel, and rub up with a silk
duster.
Commercially practicable recipe for preserved
or crystallised pineapple ? —3816.
Select ripe but firm pineapples; cut off the
outer parts and all rough brown pits, and put
these aside in a china basin for boiling with
sugar later for drinks, so that nothing is
wasted. Cut the pineapple downwards into
four even parts, and remove the solid core
to boil with the peelings. Cut the remainder
into even, wedge-shaped blocks. Boil a syrup
of lib. water to lib. sugar, or more sugar if
liked, and boil the fruit in this for a while
as for preserving. Lift out with a strainer,
and set on white paper to drain for a while.
Remove to fresh paper, sprinkle with crystal
sugar, and then dry slowly in a windy place or
in the oven with the door open. When dry,
roll well in sugar and pack into containers
lined with waxed paper. Should be boxed in
small quantities. Experience is required to
produce a good article.
(1) Composition of the anode plate of Edison
cell ? (2) Cathode plate ? (3) Electrolyte ?
(4) Voltage ? (5) Maximum output per sq. in.
of plate area ? (6) Capacity of the smallest
unit ? (7) Cost per cell ? (8) Any manufac-
turers in Australia? —3891.
(1) Zinc, amalgamated. (2) Copper oxide.
(3) Special caustic soda and oil. (4) Average
voltage, .67 per cell. (5) Not available, but
these cells have a high discharge rate owing to
their low internal resistance. (6) 75 amp. hours.
(7) 10s., plus sales tax. (8) No. Cells are
obtainable from C. M. Terry, Ltd., 115 Pitt-
street, Sydney. .
(1) Is it possible to clean the generator
of a Coleman Quicklite lantern, and how is it
done ? (2) Where, in Sydney, can I have a
new point put on a poker-work needle ? Cost ?
—3817.
(1) If the lantern is an old one, with a coil
in the centre of the generator, it is not possible
to clean it; a new generator, costing 3s. 9d.,
will be necessary. If the lantern is a new
Instant type, the generator can be renewed by
inserting a new asbestos filling, price 6d.; and
if a new needle is required in addition to the
filling, it will cost an extra Is. 6d. The
Instant generator can be posted for repairs, or
a new one obtained, by writing to the makers,
Coleman Quicklite Co., 500 Kent-street,
Sydney. (2) A new point costs from 235. to
355., but it may be possible to resheathe your
old needle at half the cost. Unscrew the
point, and send it for an estimate of resheath-
ing to Craffia Arts and Crafts, 11 Her
Majesty’s Arcade, Pitt-street, Sydney.
(1) Is there a market in Australia for mag-
nesite ? (2) Prices? (3) What are its uses? —
3659.
(1) There is a limited demand. (2) Plenty
of N.S.W. magnesite is available at about 555.
per ton delivered Sydney for 96 p.c. MgCO3
quality. (3) The biggest users are steelworks,
which usually own deposits. It is also used
in a small way by chemical manufacturers
(Epsom salts) and for cement making and
floors.
Diet for a rheumatic sufferer ? —3867.
Mutton, lamb, chicken, rabbit, fresh fish,
cabbage, spinach, cauliflower, celery, pumpkin,
marrow, apples, oranges, grapes, weak tea,
cocoa, milk, barley-water, butter, toast and
clear soup are all permissible. Eat sparingly of
boiled potatoes, tomatoes, stewed and preserved
fruit, jam, sugar, eggs, cheese, rice and tapioca.
Avoid pork, veal, ham, corned beef, bacon,
duck, goose, game, preserved meats, oysters,
beetroot, rhubarb, onions, peas, beans,
cucumber, nuts, sauces, pickles and pastry.
Take frequent aperient salines.
What is radio therapy ? —3899.
The term is applied to the treatment of disease
by means of radio-active substances, as X-
rays, radium, radium emanation, etc. It is
included in the science of radiology, which is
concerned with the study and application of
radio-activity in medical therapeutics. In
radium therapy it is necessary that the lesion
to be treated should receive a suitable exposure
to the rays to avoid injury to tissues involved;
hence the requirement of expert supervision.
Simple skin disorders such as acne rosacea,
sycosis, etc., may be treated by X-rays, which
permit greater ease in application and control.
What is fibrositis ? Can it be cured ? If
so, how ? —3874.
It may be regarded as a muscular rheumatism
that originates in the fibrous tissue and nerve
sheaths of muscles located in the affected part.
Lumbago is a common example of this trouble.
The rheumatic tendency is difficult to eradicate
in senile cases, but with prompt treatment a
cure is possible in the case of younger folk.
Rest is essential; affected parts may be strapped
for support. The elimination of any poison
focus (bowel, teeth or tonsil sepsis) is import-
ant —this is the first essential in treatment. A
doctor may advise applied heat, with massage,
diathermy and ionisation as the case demands.
What is catarrh, and what remedies are em-
ployed for it ? —3749.
Inflammation of any mucous membrane may
be diagnosed as catarrh; an increased secretion
occurs in most cases. Mucous surfaces of many
organs (stomach, intestines, bladder, etc.) may
be affected by the catarrhal process, and only
that of the nose and throat commonly comes
within the scope of home treatment. There is
no specific remedy; in chronic, well-established
cases medical supervision is essential. For
relief of post-nasal congestion, irrigate the nose
passages and gargle twice daily with a saline
wash of salt, borax and bicarbonate of soda
(1 teaspoon of the mixed powders dissolved
in a pint of tepid water). Mentholated vase-
line may be smeared within the nostrils at
night. Vaccine therapy constitutes the modern
treatment for hay-fever, which itself is a catarrh
due to external influences.
Is Maurice Gunsky, the Russian singer, still
alive ? If so, where is he ? —3686.
Nothing has been heard of him by musicians
in Australia for four years, and there have
been no new records from him in that time.
The Gramophone Company, Hayes, Middlesex,
England, may know what has become of him.
(1) What are the area and population of the
Vatican City ? (2) Conditions of the 1929
treaty with the Italian Government ? —3730.
(1) 44 hectares (108.7 acres); in December,
1932, the latest available figures, there was a
total population of 1025, including 853 Italians
and 121 Swiss. (2) There were three treaties.
A political treaty recognised the full and inde-
pendent sovereignty of the Holy See in the
City of the Vatican: a concordat regulated
the position of the Church in Italy: a financial
convention gave to the Vatican 750,000,000
lire in cash and 1,000,000,000 lire in 5 p.c.
State bonds, this to be a definite settlement of
all the monetary claims of the Holy See in
consequence of its loss of temporal power in
1870. The treaties were ratified on June 7,
1929. The Pope was given full legal, executive
and judicial power. St. Peter’s Square, though
in the city’s boundaries, is to remain normally
open to the public and subject to the powers
of the Italian police.
How could I make some of the metal flowers
which are used for shop-window decorations
and table-work in modern furnishing schemes ?
—3838.
Buy very thin sheet pewter from an artist’s
material store or a bullion merchant. It is
cheap. For the stems, get thin cane and some
fine tin wire as well as a little crepe paper and
metal enamel. Pick some large and simply-
shaped flower like the smaller Chinese magnolia
and pull it carefully to pieces so that the petals
will serve as a pattern. Cut the petal shapes
from the pewter with strong scissors. Hammer
the centre of each petal piece on a pad and so
cause it to take a slightly natural curve. At the
base of each petal punch a small hole. Thread
the tin wire through the holes, arrange the
petals round a length of cane for a stalk, pull
the wire tight and so bind it round the base
of the petals, holding them firmly to the stalk.
Cover this mounting with green or brown crepe
paper cut into narrow strips and bound round
the base of the flower and the stalk. Bend
the petals up realistically. Cut leaves from the
sheet metal in the same way, except that they
need a short tab left at their base by whicti
they may be bound to the stem of cane a-
intervals dictated by choice. If the under-side
of the petals is tinted at the edge with pastel-
toned metal enamel a. more pleasing result
will be obtained.
Has the recently issued Canadian “Jacques
Cartier” stamp any value from a collector s
point of view ? —3581.
No, but it is of interest because it was issued
to commemorate the fourth centenary ot
Cartier's arrival in Quebec. It was issued
on Jiily 1.
Brief Answers.
A.G.M.: It is not governed by statute but
by common law. If by property you mean
land, soil deposited by an act of nature, such
as a flood, on a neighbor’s land becomes part
of it; but should you refer to personal effects
such as tools, household goods, etc., he has
no right of ownerhip.... W.S.: The fact that
you are a returned soldier does not give you
fixity of tenure. The landlord may give you
notice to quit and raise the rent to a new
tenant... .A.F.: (1) and (2) The Court can
make an order for payment out of the estate
of provision for her maintenance... .M.H.:
Since A employed the solicitor he must pay the
fees irrespective of inability to collect them
from the defendant B. If B has no property,
a writ of execution would be futile. If he is
in employment, a garnishee order might be
applied for N.G.M.: (1) If you agreed that
half commission should be deferred, and appa-
rently you did so by acquiescence, you cannot
claim it until the full purchase price is paid.
(2) Not until the hire-purchase has been com-
pleted... .C.H.K.: (1) With artists’ oil paints,
or with pen-painting colors; there is also a
fabric-painting method known as “Dargeena.”
(2) Fine spirits of turpentine or tapestry oil
for oil paints; other driers supplied with special
fabric-painting colors. (3) A small arts-and-
crafts booklet is issued gratis by W. C. Pen-
fold and Co., 88 Pitt-street, Sydney; chapters
appear in most books on general craftwork.
(4) None whatever; even bazaars refuse it.
T.P.G.: Cannot trace publication. A defi-
nite cure for baldness is still awaited. Write
the Institute (London) direct for particulars.
X-ray, massage (electric) and cataphoresis
(ionisation) give variable results. These treat-
ments demand the attention of a specialist....

THE PALETTE
Except for the work of such men as
guvelot, Hugh Ramsay, John Longstaff,
W. B. Mclnnes and A. D. Colquhoun,
the centenary art exhibition at the Com-
monwealth Bank, Melbourne, is not SO
much an exhibition as an exposure of the
subservience of Australian painters
*° the art-fashions of Britain. The cen-
tenary visitors from overseas inspecting
t be display will not only be attacked by
a violent tit of nostalgia, but will have
the queer feeling that he is seated in
\y e i] s ’ s time-machine and is present at
a hundred Royal Academy exhibitions
simultaneously. The modernists are as
determined to show their attachment to
ta , ~ ~ ... ~
the Old Dart as the others, tor they dtdn t
go modern until the Royal Academy took
a f ar ! ial P ,Lln « e in > hat direction a hand-
ful of years ago. Allowing for the fact
that late George Lambert made a
slight bid for freedom in his “Chesney
Street,” it cannot be said that the rest
of his panel reveals anything much more
than a careful study of the academic
conventions current in his day. There
is sound work in LongstalTs “Mr. David
Watterson”; John Rowell’s “Passing
Gleam” overleaps the years and joins
Louis Buvelot as a piece of indepen-
dent painting ; David Davies strikes an
individual chord, somewhat romantically
muted, and Hugh Ramsay demonstrates
that he died a trifle too young to attain
to freedom. In between these odd examples
there is little to be seen but pictorial
assertions of Imperial loyalty.
Mrs. Mamie Venner, at Adelaide
Society of Arts, makes a diversion with
her painted china, already locally fam-
ous ; and the Adelaide Gallery has given
it the unusual compliment of making
several purchases. A lady with the un-
usual name of Gum, at the same gallery,
concentrates on her namesakes with
fidelity and effect.
The genuine antiques in the early-
Victorian loan exhibition at the Com-
monwealth Bank, Melbourne, range from
one of Queen Victoria’s nightdresses to
a truncheon used by a warder at Port
Arthur. There are charming old prints
and lovely furniture and beautiful crys-
tal, rugs and tapestries which suggest
that if elegance was not widely dis-
tributed in early Victoria it was cer-
tainly highly concentrated and of first-
rate quality. Couples contemplating
matrimony should inspect the delightful
reconstruction of a pioneer or Batman-
esque bedroom. It is an oasis of refined
seclusion where the voice of a radio
crooner would be the essence of vul-
garity, and into which nobody above the
social status of a bushranger would
burst with impunity. A modern bed-
room looks as if anybody could burst
into it without knocking.

PREPARING FOR THE COMING SEASON.
PRACTICAL HINTS ON “SPRING CLEANING.”
BY FRED BERRY.
THOUSANDS of Australian motorists are to-day driving cars
with speedometer readings of between ten and forty
thousand miles who would, in normal circumstances, be
diligently poring over catalogues with the object of selecting
a new car for the coming season. But, even though Australia
may have “turned the corner,” only a small proportion will be
able to gratify this desire, and the best plan for the others will
be to prepare for a trouble-free summer by at once commencing
a “spring cleaning.”
In everyday affairs meeting trouble
half-way is generally supposed to be a
bull-headed policy, but in motoring it
has been proved over and over again
to be both effective and economical.
Complete valve as-
sembly ready for grind-
ing in: A, camshaft;
B, tappet; C, valve

removed).
Furthermore,
the wise
motorist not

his troubles

wherever pos-
sib 1 e nips

fore they
start at all.
Only those
who have ex-
perie n c ed
such irritating
trifles as
starving car-
burettors, flat
batteries,
loose fittings
and stubborn
engines can
fully realise
how motor-
ing may be
hampered
and how
petty expen-
diture over a
season’s run-
nin g can
mount to
alarming pro-
portions
through such
causes. While
the amount
of work
necessary in
the case of
any given car
will in some
measure de-
pend upon
age and mile-
age, yet, no
matter how
old the car,
“spring clean-
ing” will re-
pay the owner
handsomely.
Naturally, last year’s model, showing
8000 miles, will be in better shape
mechanically than a car of more ancient
vintage, but, irrespective of age, there are
a number of matters demanding careful
attention.
Engine Overhaul.
Dealing first with the engine, every
driver must realise the importance of
efficiency. A good engine is a pleasure
to sit behind, but the same motor in a
sluggish mood is a source of irritation
on a long journey, and, what is of equal
importance, piles up expenses in terms of
excess benzine and oil.
Whether the essential overhaul is to be
done in the home garage or at a service
station is a matter solely for personal
decision, but, due to simplifications of
design and standardising of fittings, a
number of jobs can now be successfully
accomplished by the owner-driver which
hitherto required the services of a skilled
mechanic.
Broadly speaking, if the car has done
more than 10,000 miles since last over-
haul (or in the case of a new machine
after 6000 miles) one should lift the
head, decarbonise, grind valves and make
a careful check of tappet clearances and
ignition.
To be successful in this work one
must proceed methodically. Don’t rush
in haphazard fashion, but keep all tools
clean and in their proper place. After
lifting the head and during the process
of scraping carbon from pistons and
combustion head, plug the cylinder
barrels with clean cheesecloth where
pistons are on bottom centres, and sq
prevent hard flakes of carbon from
falling in.
Restoring Compression.
Valve-grinding will demand the great-
est care, for upon perfect valve seating
depend compression, high engine per-
formance and economy. After removing
valves the valve heads and seatings must
be carefully examined, and if faces in
either case are badly pitted it is only
wasting time to attempt to restore com-

to original level.
pression by grinding. Pay the few shil-
lings necessary to have the faces
properly reground and seatings recut
with precision tools. Under normal con-
ditions, however, “grinding in” will serve
the purpose, and here one must be both
careful and patient. The golden rule is
to use as little paste as possible. Give
the valves only half-turns with the
grinding tool, and as soon as the surfaces
begin to “squeak” withdraw the valve
and examine the face.
Put valves back dry and continue the
process. Examination under a strong
light will show a more or less fine line
which indicates exactly the area of con-
tact between face and seating. The ideal
seating is, of course, a perfect “hairline”
around the centre of both valve head
and seating, and the amateur mechanic
would be well advised to continue with
the operation until at least a continuous
ring of contact is secured. This done,
wash all traces of grinding compound
from metal surfaces with liberal applica-
tions of benzine, and after assembling
the valve gear and replacing the cylinder
head be certain that the copper asbestos
gasket is intact. If it is not, buy a new
one.
Provided cylinder head and block are
unwarped there will be no occasion to

break points in distributor head.
use gasket cement, but where any doubts
exist smear the cement on only one
side ; otherwise you will experience great
difficulty in dismantling the engine at
the next overhaul.
Important Adjustments.
When drawing down cylinder-head
nuts it is essential to do the work pro-
gressively, commencing at the centre
studs and alternately taking up one each
side. After all nuts are hand-tight, go
over them in the same order several
times until they are finally hard home.
This done, the major portion of engine
overhaul has been accomplished, but
there are still a number of important
details to watch. Due to “grinding in”
the valves, tappet clearances, vitally
essential to engine performance, must be
set exactly to maker’s specification.
Don’t guess at these adjustments, but use
a feeler gauge. The old trick of using
a visiting-card as a gauge is hopelessly
wrong. After replacing induction and
exhaust manifold and making sure that
all gaskets are sound and gastight, pro-
ceed with overhaul of the ignition.
Make certain in coil-and-battery sys-
tems that the battery is fully charged
and that all contacts behind the instru-
ment board are tight and free from rust.
Inspect the distributor head and see that
the grease-cup lubricating the central
spindle is fitted with grease. Check up
make-and-break points for correct gap
(again using the feeler gauge), and while
on the job look for signs of “pitting”
on the breaker points, a sure indication
of faulty condenser and promise of a
breakdown at a not too distant date.
Spark plugs must be removed, cleaned
and inspected, and, if more than 15,000
miles old, replaced with new equipment.
If the old set appears efficient, be care-
ful that the setting of points is at least
four-thousandths greater than that of the
make-and-break. In final assembly,

watch closely for frayed or cracked high-

replacement rather than risk anything
doubtful.

Remove the drain plug from fuel tank
and decant off condensed water and
foreign matter. Take out gauze filters
from the fuel line, pass them quickly
through a gas flame and finally stand
them in benzine overnight.
Ancient Fuel Systems.
Where older-model cars are concerned,
it would be advisable to dismantle the
vacuum tank, wash out thoroughly and,
in reassembling, make quite sure all air
and fuel connections are perfectly tight
and free from leaks.
Before leaving the engine it would be
as well to examine the fan belt, for
almost invariably it serves to drive both
water impellor and generator. Should
it fail or stretch unduly the motorist
would be in an unhappy position until a
replacement was procurable, for while
the car could be driven for long distances
without generator
charge the motor
would overheat
on hills without
the aid of the
mechanical pump
in the water-cir-
culating system.

motors it will be

Should this be the case, there will be no
option but to fit a new one —you can t
take links out to compensate for length
due to difference in pitch. The chain,
in effect, functions on the principle of a
gear-wheel, and you can’t put a gear-
wheel back minus a tooth. If you con-
tinue driving with a slack timing chain
it is almost certain that the timing will
jump a tooth, performance being
affected to such an extent that it will
be a difficult matter to drive along the
level in top gear, while a hill of any
degree will call for bottom gear, and,
even if one contrives to scramble over
the grade, the cooling water will boil
vigorously and the motor overheat.
(Next week further details of the
“spring cleaning” will be given.)

THE STEERING COLUMN
Influence of Color in Automobile
Design.
Experts say that incorrectly selected
colors for the interior of a closed car
can decrease the apparent size of the
passenger compartment, affect the moods
of the occupants, distort the appearance
of complexion and impair the mental ease
and visual comfort of passengers. It is
for these reasons that the correct choice
of upholstery colors is a matter of im-
portance to both the car manufacturer
and the purchaser of vehicle.
Color’s most dominant influence is
emotional. The importance of color
gradation in achieving beauty may be
best illustrated by comparing an even
tint of green on paper with a leaf. It
will be observed that the beauty of the
green leaf is dependent upon the perfect
alliance of texture and color; and so
it is with the inside of a car. According
to color technologists black and deep
neutral greys are conducive to melan-
cholia and general depression, blue in-
duces calm and contentment, and greyed
green and yellow impart amiability and
vitality. Shades of purple are said to be
soothing, besides imparting delicacy. Red
is stimulating, orange irritating, while
browns convey an atmosphere of restful-
ness and friendly ease.
Plain interiors are claimed to be more
hospitable and restful-looking, while the
apparent size of the passenger compart-
ment is said to be reduced in direct,
degree to the amount of contrast present
between the hues and textures incor-
porated in the interior set-up. Uphol-
stery colors look well when they bear a
direct relationship to the exterior finish
of car, and as a general rule it is pleas-
ing to afford some contrast between out-
side and interior. In this connection
complementary shades provide an agree-
able contrast.
How Brakes Should Be Applied.
The act of applying the brakes may
appear quite simple to the novice, but
there is a lot to be learnt about braking.
After one has mastered the first principles
of stopping a car, sudden application of
the brakes should be avoided, except in
emergencies. Sensitive foot' action should
be studied so as to feel the extent to
which one is using the pedals. By brak-

ing smoothly, one can greatly minimise
tyre wear. When the brake shoes have
been brought gently into contact with the
drums, the car commences to decelerate ;
it is then possible to increase the pres-
sure of the brakes without producing the
sudden change of velocity which causes
shock. Furthermore, this procedure is
far less likely to lock a wheel on a slip-
pery road than is a jerky and abrupt
pedal action. Sudden braking is a very
common prelude to a skid.
The question sometimes arises as to
whether or not the clutch pedal should
be depressed simultaneously with the
brake pedal. The answer depends on the
circumstances. Under all normal con-
ditions, where only a slight amount of
braking is needed, there is no objection
to declutching ; many experienced drivers
believe that on a greasy road it is actually
safer not to declutch. However, for all
moderate degrees of braking, it is pro-
bably immaterial whether or not the
clutch is disengaged. In the case of an
emergency stop, the power of modern
four-wheel brakes is such as to slow a
car more quickly than if the compres-
sion of the engine were solely relied on.
Consequently, the brakes, in addition to
stopping the car, must work to stop the
engine if the clutch is left engaged. It
follows that for a minimum stopping dis-
tance on a dry road, where the brakes
can be used to the full extent, the clutch
pedal should also be depressed. The art
of braking lies in securing safe control
and the avoidance of skidding by a gentle
use of the brake pedal.

“Phoenix”: “All right?” For answer he
pointed to his radiator, the cap of which
he was unscrewing with the aid of a
sugarbag. “Just a leaking radiator,” he
apologised after I had walked back to his
ancient ’bus ; “easily fixed, you know.”
Gathering a handful of road-sweepings
he thrust them in, remarking, “Never
known to fail.” His radiator won’t go to
the repair shop until the car ousts the
last horse from our roads.

“E.H.”: In Hobart a person wish-
ing to learn to drive a car must
get a permit (without fee), which
lasts for one month only. Prac-
tice is limited to Queen’s Domain
roads between the hours of sunrise and
sunset. No provision exists for any ex-
tension for any reason whatsoever, which
means that if a person applies for and
secures a permit and becomes ill before
passing a driving test he has no further
opportunity of learning.
“Rigor Mortis”: Queensland has a
surprising number of skeleton towns.
Woolgar, north of Richmond, had once
a population of over 3000,
pubs in galore, a police
station and post office. Now
it has 25 miles of perma-
nently running water, beauti-
ful country, and, at the
most, three houses. Pent-
land, west of Charters
Towers, for a time held over 30,000. It
has become a scattering of houses, de-
pendent solely on its trucking depot.
Thalanga, a few miles east, had over
9000, with a few more pubs and shanties
than the average. It is nothing now but
a siding on the railway and the remains
of one shanty.

“El V.”: In parts of Australia justice

(Vic.), in the wild, rough country
along the N. S. Wales border, some-
body perceived that a luckless farmer had
allowed sweetbriar and blackberry to
grow on his land and that another had
rabbits on his place. An expedition
served both with summonses, and a
stipendiary magistrate followed. His
diary should read something like this:
Thursday. —Left home at Bairnsdale;
arrived Orbost.
Friday. —Weary journey by car to Dele-
gate (N.S.W.). Snowy River as snowy as
ever.
Saturday. —Crossed back to native Vic-
toria, nine miles over unspeakable track
in hire car. How Griffith Taylor and
Mungo Park would have loved this part of
the expedition! Joined at Bendoc by
prosecutor, who had arrived after perilous
journey by motor-bike, and by the black-
berry cultivator, who said he had “great
difficulty in keeping growth down in this
rough, hilly country.” Sympathised with
him. Had trouble in even keeping my
breakfast down on trip across border.

P. P. Eckersley, in an article in “Popu-

storm centres of the world are situated
in Central Africa, Central Australia
and the Gulf of Mexico.” All regions
where duststorms are prevalent, and
every inland listener in Australia knows
that upon the arrival of a dust-laden
wind static usually develops into a con-
tinual roar. Thus possibly we may some
day give the static imp a quietus by
watering Centralia to keep the dust
down. Overlanding motorists would
approve ; but what a job for a Water

M L. (Gatton, Q.). — My 1927 Chev. (12,000
miles) is heavy on oil and petrol. 1 have fitted
a smaller jet and new rings and improved con-
sumption, but radiator water still boils on hills.
Replace the original jet. The mixture is
now too weak. Check valve seatings and adjust
clearance when motor is hot to 6-1000 in. inlet
and 8-1000 in. exhaust. Make sure the fan
belt is tight, and check timing gear.
W.H.B. (Bombala, N.S.W.). — Is the gearbox
dispensed with in cars fitted with a fluid fly-
wheel ?
Not yet. The car can be driven in any one
gear, but the gearbox is still used to provide
better acceleration and for hill-climbing.
D.R.G. (March, N.S.W.). — My 1926 4 -cyl.
Dodge has done 42,000 miles, and a knock
has developed in the back cylinder. As I only
do about 3000 miles a year, I don’t feel dis-
posed to have a rebore. Can you suggest an
alternative ?
Knock may be due to a slack gudgeon-pin,
in which case you can fit an oversize and
so cure the tap. New “hammered” rings,
centrifugally cast, such as Brico or Fitwell,
may improve compression and stave off the
rebore for some time.
C.M. (Bondi, N.S.W.). — Would you advise
me how to remove tar spots and rain marks
from duco ? Also how to oil leaves of springs
and what to use ?
Accessory houses supply special tar-removers,
but either benzol or petroleum ether will do.
Rain marks are due to the use of unsuitable
polish, and can only be removed by further
cleaning. Should this fail, go over lightly
with a rubbing-down compound. Spring leaves
should be lubricated with graphite compound
if permanent results are desired. Weekly
application of lubricating oil and Nuturpo—
half and half rubbed on sides of springs with
a stiff brush—will keep squeaks away.

spare parts be obtained ?

cadilly, London, W.l.
Austin (Bowral, N.S.W.). — Would my 1927
4 -cyl. car be improved if rubber washers were
placed under the engine holding-down bolts ?
Unless existing holes in chassis members
were recessed to take specially-made hard
rubber cones you would more than likely
throw the transmission out of line by fitting
rubber washers. It is extremely doubtful if
they would improve running to any appreciable
extent.
G.G. (Toorak, Vic.). — When were four-wheel
brakes first fitted as standard equipment ?
Isotta-Fraschini fitted four-wheel brakes in
1905, Argyll (sleeve-valve model) in 1912; but
they did not come into general use until
1927-28.
W.A.S. (Norwood, S.A.). — The battery of my
1927 Olds, is partly run down, and when I
start up by crank first thing in morning there
is a continual high-piched squeak that I
cannot locate. Is there any serious fault ?
Squeak is due to rusty condition of shank
and bush of starting-handle through long
periods of idleness. A little lubricating oil
will rectify the trouble; but you should either
fit a new battery or have the old one re-
conditioned, otherwise you may be caught in
a most uncomfortable position.

Motor Oddities.
When motorists foregather the topics of conversation seldom centre in
technical or abstract features, but rather in personal experiences or
achievements.
Arguments wax hot where petrol consumption or speeds over specified
routes are concerned, and the cost of maintenance and the present mechanical
condition of cars after years of use are matters of extreme interest. Huge
annual mileages, old driving licenses, and perhaps low car numbers support
claims to experience, while many drivers, with characteristic Australian
ingenuity, have made interesting emergency repairs.
Who has driven more than 500,000 miles, and which driver covers the
greatest distance each year?
Thrills and extraordinary driving experiences have not been confined to
racing drivers, while outback the bush mechanic, hundreds of miles from
repair shops, has worked miracles in order to get the car home.
Motorists are invited to write to “The Bulletin” and recount their
experiences.

EXPLAINING THE CONDENSER.
BY DON B. KNOCK.
The condenser plays a most important part in the transmission and
reception of radio signals, and this brief description of its functions
should be of interest to those beginning to study radio technique.
The condenser separates the radio-fre- In A.C. receivers, condensers are con-

Various con-
denseis guide the

audible signals are obtained. It is the
functioning of the condenser that effects
the change from one station to another.
With grid leak and condenser detec-
tion the condenser makes the valve func-
tion. The small condenser placed in the
grid circuit allows the free passage of
radio-frequency energy, but prohibits the
flow of the direct grid current. This
forces the grid current' through the high
resistance, providing the valve with the
bias necessary for its operation as this
kind of detector.
The small amount of signal voltage
could not be made effective if it had to
pass much resistance. The signal voltage,
therefore, passes through the low-re-
sistance path of the condenser, for all
electric current takes the path of least
resistance.
A condenser is often placed across the
headphones in the detector circuit. This
is to ensure that any radio-frequency
energy that has passed through the valve
is by-passed to earth. It prevents this
energy from passing through the high-
reactance windings of the headphones,
while the valve prevents the audio fre-
quency from short-circuiting to earth, and
forces it through the windings of the
headphones, to actuate, in turn, the
diaphragm. Here again the condenser
keeps the current flowing in the right
direction.
follow its respective path. In one part of
the circuit, a condenser may be placed
across a choke coil. The radio-frequency
energy then passes through it with prac-
tically no loss, which would normally be
incurred by passing through the high-
reactance windings. Another condenser
may be used with the choke to allow

the free passage of the audio-frequency
current, yet to prevent the flow of radio-
frequency energy.
The condenser is really the heart of
the power supply. The function of the
filter, which smooths out the pulsating
current from the rectifier, is dependent
upon the action of a large-capacity con-
denser. Choke coils are only used as
an additional aid in the smoothing action.
Finally, of all pieces of apparatus used
in the manufacture of transmitting and
receiving apparatus, the condenser is the
most efficient. Less loss of current
occurs when passing through a con-
denser than any other part of the appa-
ratus, and with careful design and manu-
facture the losses in the condenser are
negligible.

MEANDERINGS OF A RADIO CONSULTANT.
When one has for many years
answered radio questions, singly, collec-
tively and in bulk, one should know
something about people, if not a little
about radio!
What is the use of printing requests to
“write on one side of the paper,” “write
legibly,” “sign your name and address,”
or “enclose stamped and addressed en-
velope for direct reply”? Some do, but'
a lot don’t, and it’s no use protesting.
Questions! Pathetic, weird, entreating,
compelling and even sarcastic ; they all
come, and they have to be taken in the
spirit in which they were sent.
Because it is in man to try to fashion
things with his own hands, the home-
constructor, when radio came along, saw
the descriptive article, and began to
conquer the technicalities of the new
science. He started doing it en masse
around 1920, and he is still doing it in
this year of grace. That he will go on
doing it despite the fact that he can buy
fairly inexpensive “ready-mades” is cer-
tain, and prognostications that the radio
constructor will disappear from the map
are ridiculous. Whilst politicians and
militarists rattle the sabre in Europe, the
radio constructor flocks in his thousands
to Radiolympia or the great wireless
show in Berlin. Sensible youth has more
desire to make something than to
destroy, and radio is a great uniter of
nations.
One can glean from correspondence
the sacrifices that have been made to
acquire the parts to make this or that
radio creation ; the laborious sketching
of the diagram which it is hoped will suit
some old components on hand, some-
times workable, but more often likely to
ruin cherished valves. One of the big-
gest handicaps in dispensing advice in-
tended to put the supplicant on the
right track is the influence of the “five-
minute expert.” The seeker of advice
has probably been in the hands of such
a knowall, and has either been side-
tracked or otherwise disappointed. Go-
getting crooks have nothing on some of
these “experts” in the matter of causing
loss and trouble, and sooner or later one
is asked to clean up the mess they have
left.
Then there is the aggressive type of
correspondent—the man who has “made
your such-and-such receiver and can’t
get any sense out of it,” etc. After
weeks and perhaps months of letters
both ways, one is constrained to take
the bull by the horns and make a per-
sonal inspection of the receiver. Usually
it is then discovered that anything and
everything was used rather than the com-
ponents specified and recommended, and
the attempt has produced something en-
tirely different from the original. This
type of correspondent often assumes the
injured attitude of “You designed it, so
you are responsible.” Another type of
constructor is the man with a beautiful
sense of mechanical engineering. He
makes a splendid structural job of his
apparatus, but his electrical knowledge
is nil. A combination of mechanical and
electrical aptitude is rare. Often a re-
ceiver is presented for inspection and
elucidation of faults, and turns out to be
the last word as a piece of metalwork
but prevented from functioning by
earthed grids or shorted tuning con-
densers.
Short-wave receivers provide pitfalls
for the unwary that don’t yawn before the
constructor of the average broadcast re-
ceiver. It is comparatively easy to put
together a broadcast receiver with the
aid of technical directions and a cir-
cuit diagram, and in nine cases out of
ten it works from the time it is switched
on. Short-wave receiver construction is
another matter. The greatest source of
trouble here is long, straggling wiring in
tuned circuits. Crankiness and hope-
less performance are the punishments for
sloppiness in short-wave receiver build-
ing. If a broadcast model must be rea-
sonably well put together to give good
results, a thousand times more care must
be taken with the short-wave set, how-
ever humble its category. A lot of rea-
sons exists just why this or that should or
should not be done, and as the average
radio constructor is remarkably patient
and something of a sticker he finds them
all out at last. His multifarious prob-
lems have a wistful appeal to the experi-
enced man who elects to try to solve
them. Fascinating game, this radio!
What next? Television? Getting nearer,
but still a long way around that corner.
QUEREX.
THE LOUD PEDAL.
Everybody knows something about the
piano, and we hear it over the radio
20 times a day. Somebody long ago
dubbed it the “household orchestra,” a
very touching tribute to the volume
of sound the instrument can produce.
Properly speaking, of course, there is no
such instrument as a piano. It is a piano-
forte. Noah Webster defines “piano” as
“even, smooth, soft” and as “a direction
to the performer to play softly” ; so you
see that the shortened term we all use
is a particularly erroneous misnomer.
The pundits explain that the name piano-
forte (it was “forte piano” at first) was
given because, in contradistinction to the
harpsichord and spinet, the instrument

can be played both loud and soft, but this
I doubt. If you couldn’t play a spinet
loud who the dickens would ever have
wanted to play one.
What made the pianoforte popular
beyond all fear of backsliding was the
loud pedal, the invention of John Broad-
wood, whose successors are still in the
business. This was an immensely im-
portant innovation, and the only funda-
mental addition that has been made to
the original idea in 150 years. Some
Yankee pianos nowadays have a third
pedal that sustains the tone of one
double handful of notes only; others
have rollers at the backs of the keys for
facilitating the glissando; the Moor
pianoforte has two keyboards and can

play coupled octaves, but these resources
are not very widely appreciated. Other-
wise, always excepting that loud pedal,
the instrument is, in principle and artistic
significance, the same as when John
Sebastian Bach tried a sample and said
it was “only fit for rondos.” .
Almost all the leading pianists are
agreed that the use of the loud pedal is
almost as important as touch and finger-
ing. They say that by its use it is pos-
sible to paint in tone, and a great many
of them nowadays use it to paint pictures
which are not at all what old composers
intended. Ever since there was a loud
pedal there have been performers who
used it to cover up digital errors, but
until a comparatively few years ago they
were regarded in serious musical circles
as rude barbarians. Anton Rubinstein,
possibly the most forceful pianist who
ever lived—when he had finished a recital
his collar was a limp rag and his hair
was sopping wet' with perspiration—was
noted for the fact that he not infrequently
struck a wrong note (though Groves
speaks of his “absolute perfection of tech-
nique”). If he had been a pedal-tone-
painter of the modern sort nobody would
have been able to discover which of his
unimportant notes were wrong and which
right. A great many modern pianists of
the front rank, such as Backhaus, are
continually experimenting with new pedal
effects. Paderewski more and more seeks
to distil new sweetnesses from pedal
manipulations. These great masters of
technique produce some very wonderful
effects, but oldsters sigh for the old tradi-
tion by which every note had to be
enunciated—the runs and scales like
strings of tiny pearls ; the arpeggi clearly
showing their structure. Teresa Carreno
was the last great exponent of that school.
It was her greatest charm to some of us
that she made the most intricate passages
of Beethoven or Liszt sound pellucidly
simple and Mozart as artless as a five-
finger exercise.
That’s no longer the way on the key-
board sea. Mostly to blame are Chopin
and Grieg. Chopin was himself a very
sparing spreader of pedal colors either
as composer or executant, but all fingers
are not made like his, and it was first
found easy and then made fashionable to
indicate the outlines of his architecture
and fill them in with a pedal blur. Grieg’s
unusual harmonies sound queer unless
each note has exact balance. Far easier
to blur the lot and make him sound
wildly bizarre and futuristic, and, above
all, tremendously difficult.
Naming no names and accusing no-
body of anything, there is a good deal
of pianoforte music coming over the air
nowadays, gramophone-recorded and
otherwise, that owes more of its impres-
siveness to loud pedal than to neat fingers
and good taste. Let the offenders beware.

31m. and 25m. bands have been coming
in from 11 p.m. onwards at excellent
strength. In the early part of a recent
week signal strength was below usual,
with the exception of RVIS, on 70m.,
which has been fully available as early
as 7.30 p.m. when static permitted. RNE
has been excellent at about midnight.
The 8.8. C. stations in the Australian
transmission, which has been pushed on
an hour now, starting at 5.15, are, as
far as GSB (31.5 m.), excellent, but not
even the carrier of GSD is audible.
CTIAA has reappeared, but on a
slightly different' frequency, announced as
31.17 m.; at about 7.15 on a recent morn-
ing this station came in clearly. It
uses a cuckoo call which is easily iden-
tified, and announces in various lan-
guages.
PHI has gone back to the 25m, band,
and reception is good in every v/ay. The
station is using a wave-length between
FYA and GSD —announcement of the
precise frequency was missed. 2RO was
heard testing its new transmitter on the
Blh between 11 and 12 p.m., reception
being good in strength and quality. This
station has not been heard at the former
hours of transmission so far.
There has hot been much to hear in
the daytime. FYA has been fair, and
a few Americans have been coming in
about 8 a.m. The short-wave sessions

use in New Guinea. The original was described in B. 18/7/’34, and is an

from WBXK (25.25 m.) at 2 p.m. on
Sundays have been missing; probably
they will not be audible again till next
winter.
Both DJA (31.38 m.) and GSE (25.2 m.)
are coming in round midnight at great
strength. GSE is much stronger than last
year, due, no doubt, to its new aerial
system. Volume on both these stations
had to be cut down considerably. The
19m. band is still poor. GSF and FYA
can be copied, and that is about all. The
40m. stations are much weaker in the
morning and barely worth listening to
now.
At night the D.E.I. station has been ex-
cellent, as also has PMV (58m.), but
static plays up in this band at this time
of the year.
The amateur ’phone 3ZX (Voice of
the South) put over another excellent
programme at noon recently. This
station intends to try 10 metres, which
will be interesting. I once heard in the
summertime a very fine 10-metre trans-
mission from VK2HC —no static or fad-
ing or noise level of any sort. A receiver
is, of course, pretty touchy at those high
frequencies, and not many will tune
down to that wave-length.
NIGHTOWL.
Amateur Chatter.
The fascinating thing about amateur
communication is that when one goes to
the receiver and switches on one never
knows who or what one is likely to hear.
Some DX, of course, but there is always
the chance that unexpected signals will
show up from some remote part of the
world. They did in the first week-end of
the Melbourne centenary contest, on 20
metres. As early as 8.30 p.m. two Eng-
lishmen were audible in Sydney, calling
“CQ VK”; also a Finlander and a
U.S.S.R. station on the European side of
that massive country. In previous years
the time for Europeans on 20 has been,
during October, from 11 p.m. onward,
but things seem to have shifted forward
a few hours. Another contrast to former
conditions is the sudden arrival on 20 of
American first- and second-district signals
around 9 p.m., with good workable signal
strength. They also express their sur-
prise at hearing Australians at this time
on 20.
In order to produce a signal which,
upon reaching a location 12,000 miles
or so distant, will have sufficient edge on
it to render it more readable than the
perfectly pure D.C. kind, several ama-
teurs use unfiltered rectified A.C. either
on a final or intermediate amplifier, or
even crystal oscillator. This practice
causes a little interference locally, but
when a non-frequency controlled raw
A.C. signal is launched in the middle of
the most crowded band it is time to
kick. A Sydney amateur, newly licensed,
but with an old-timer callsign, was guilty
of this, 9 /10 / ’34, 7 p.m., S.M.T. The
noise was akin to a buzz-saw. In 1934
there is no excuse for transmission of this
nature anywhere in the short-wave spec-
trum, even if the bands are a few thou-
sand kilocycles wide.
Col. Clair Foster, W6HM, staunch up-
holder of amateur welfare, tells of some-
thing interesting he found out recently.
Whilst he is a citizen of the U.S., when
he is in Canada (as he is often) he is a
British subject, but under the laws of
Canada still not a Canadian citizen. This
arises from the fact that his parents are
British subjects ; his brothers and sisters
were reared under the Maple Leaf. Clair
was born just across the border.
On 3.5mc., 11/10/’34, most of the even-
ing from 8 p.m. onwards was taken up in
listening to a debate at the Waverley
Radio Club rooms, between members of
the Waverley and Lakemba clubs, on the
subject of “Plate versus Grid Modula-
tion.” The debate was radiated by
VK2BV, and quality was excellent.
Waverley Club won in favor of grid
modulation by 31 points to 23.
Visiting amateurs VKSFB and VKSPK
from S.A. arrived in Sydney per motor-
caravan, fitted with mobile transmitting
and receiving gear powered by Ever-
Ready batteries. A view of sFB’s home
station in Wilmington (S.A.) reveals a

communication, and is in a maze of
Pickard aerials and unity-coupled oscil-
lators. 56mc. is due for a revival, but
s ° me attention should be paid the use
of super-regenerators on 28mc., really a
f ar useful band for cross-city
working.

much wider frequency range. The diffi-
culty will be that one receiver will not
suit everybody, as it will be difficult to
make the same instrument suitable for
both local and long-distance reception.
It seems that to take full advantage of a
high-fidelity receiver either some of the
crowded stations will have to go, or the
frequency allocation must be spread over
a much wider range. Thus Australia
may yet be using the now neglected 1000-
to 2000-metre band.

The 1934 Radiolympia recently held
in London glittered with exhibits large
and small. The two main attractions
from the spectacular viewpoint were the
gigantic clock and the “Marconimen,”
The former stretched almost to the roof
of Olympia, with the clock-face showing
a 17ft. dial and hours indicated in red
neon tubing. Above, in blue, was the
kneeling figure of a girl. Four huge
gongs, the largest being 60ft. in length,
were at the side of the clock, with reclin-
ing female figures in blue neon light hold-
ing green neon mallets. The mallets were
raised and lowered to strike the chimes,
the kneeling figure at the top counting
the hours. It was an electrical and horo-
logical exhibit of no mean order, for the
whole arrangement was synchronised
electrically with Big Ben at Westminster.
The “Marconimen” were arranged, four
of them, on the Marconi stand, each a
huge figure resting on one knee, with out-
stretched .hand supporting a terrestrial
globe illuminated from within. The
figures were made of chromium-plated
steel-frames supporting translucent-glass
panels, and weighed about a ton each,
including the cast-aluminium heads.

An American broadcasting station of
some magnitude prided itself on its
studio-heating arrangements. There was
a rumpus when the studio manager,
right in the middle of a heat-wave, in-
dented for an oil-stove. It was explained
that the drummer in a new orchestra,
using some sort of a Cuban-drum,
simply couldn’t play the thing in ordi-
nary temperatures, and the thing had to
be heated up.
In Sweden a drought was responsible
for suspension of a high-power broad-
casting service. The huge long-wave
station at Kalundborg works on hydro-
electric power. Absence of rain necessi-
tated economising ruthlessly, and for
some time the station was practically
closed down owing to lack of power.
This must be the first time that micro-
phones have been too dry to talk!

A distinct contrast to the 8.8.C.’s re-

Casual Comment.
“VK2NO”: One never knows what
may lie behind the scenes in amateur
communication, and it is interesting to
speculate upon the conditions under
which the other fellow runs his station.
The operator at the U.S. Marine Bar-
racks station, OMITB, located at Sumay,
Guam, P. 1., upon opening conversation
with the writer remarked that “Coming
from New York recently I thought this
would be an amateur’s paradise, but the
shack is full of bugs, and the lizards are
clambering all over the condensers.”
The “bugs” mustn’t be taken too liter-
ally ; Americans apply the term to any
kind of insect.

Regular short-wave listeners would, no
doubt, appreciate interpretation of the
voluble talking in Russian from the power-
ful 70.2-metre RVIS station, situated at
Khabarovsk, Siberia, fully audible most
evenings in Australia. E.M., Lismore
(N.S.W.), who understands Russian,
volunteers the following further informa-
tion: “RVIS stated that sugar in U.S.S.R.
is 4s. per pound, and a dinner in a cafi
costs from 265. to 30s. (equivalents in
Australian currency). Short-measure sell-
ing and cheating are so pronounced in
shops that the authorities simply cannot
cope with it.”
The Q. and A. Column.
A modification of the Wide-World Four
is under consideration, leaving out the Class-B
audio and using 32, 15 and PM22A valves.
(1) Should such a receiver give good head-
phone reception of Sydney stations 350 miles
north, particularly 2GB ? (2) Would satisfac-
tory headphone results be possible if the R.F.
stage is omitted ? I can use only 30ft. aerial.
(3) I intend using 23-plate midget variable con-
densers in place of those specified. If this will
alter coil data, please supply details. (4) Would
there be any increase in signal strength if an
aerial coil is used on the R.F. instead of the
midget grid coupling condenser ? If so, how
many turns ? (5) Would a 23-plate midget
across the tuning condenser be sufficient for
bandspread on the amateur bands, or should
one also be paralleled across the R.F. tuning
condenser ? —153.
(1) Yes. (2) Yes, but tuning will be much
more critical and fussy. (3) The 23-plate
midgets can be used. Add approximately one
turn on the short-wave grid coils and about
eight turns on the broadcast coil. (4) Depends
upon the aerial system used. If the aerial is
short as you suggest, you will do better to
connect the aerial direct to the cathode, not
through a condenser. The cathode coil serves
also as an aerial coupling thus. See article on
tuned aerial input for short waves elsewhere.
(5) A 23-plate midget is far too big for band-
spread. Seven plates should be ample. No
bandspread condenser is needed on the R.F.
stage. That Air King set can be made less
hungry on B batteries on the lines of the
Wide-World Four.
Having the following parts on hand, 1 would
appreciate a circuit diagram of a simple two-
valve receiver: .0005 -mfd. variable condenser,
.00025 -mfd. variable condenser, .00025 -mfd.
fixed condenser, a two-meg. grid leak, 5-to-\
ratio audio transformer, two Mullard two-volt
general-purpose valves and a reel of 24-gauge
D.C.C. wire.— lsl.
The circuit diagram illustrated is of a two-
valve Reinartz-type receiver. This is particu-
larly easy to make. Note that free bias is
provided for the audio valve by the inclusion
in the B negative of the 600-ohm resistor, by-
passed by the 1-mfd. condenser. The coil
unit may be made by using a 3in. diameter
former, winding 45 turns for the grid coil, and
in continuation, in the same direction, 25 turns
of the same wire for reaction. The aerial
may be coupled to a tap on the grid coil or
through a fixed condenser.

Weak Kidneys
STABBING PAINS IN THE BACK, LUMBAGC)
You are justified in regarding
Kidney Trouble as a serious com-
plaint, but you should not let it
make you miserable or spoil your
life. Excepting in very rare cases,
Kidney Trouble yields quickly to
treatment with De Witt’s Pills, and
thus the remedy is within your
easy reach.
Chemists everywhere sell De
Witt’s Pills, and it is a wise plan to
keep a box handy
in the house so that
you can take one or
two the moment you
recognise symptoms
of kidney trouble.
You may awaken with a nasty
taste in your mouth; your tongue
may be coated, your breath foul.
There may be puffiness under your
eyes. Your ankles or your feet may
swell and there may be pain in your
back or your hips or your shoulders.
These are signs by which you may
know that all is not well with your
kidneys. They are allowing uric
acid to escape in dangerous quan-
tities to poison your blood and
torture your body, but De Witt’s
Pills will quickly put you right,
TAKE TWO TO-NIGHT
Take two of DeWitt’s Pills to-night
and in the morning you will see, feel
and know for certain that they are
doing you good.
because they contain ingredients
which act directly upon the kidneys.
They make the kidneys healthy and
active, and so rid your system of
harmful uric acid.
Nature intended that your kidneys should
act as filters to keep your system pure and free
from poisonous waste matters. By taking
De Witt’s Pills you give weak or congested
kidneys just the natural assistance they need,
and the alarming symptoms quickly disappear.
Thus you see that the treatment of kidney
trouble is quite simple.
There is no need for alarm
and no reason why the
ailment should get the
upper hand and make a
slave of you. The only
thing to remember is that
prompt treatment saves
much suffering and prevents the ailment
getting a firm hold on your system. That
is why you should get De Witt’s Pills quickly.
The cost is trifling, and a remedy that has
already relieved thousands cannot fail to do
you good. Don’t stop to think it over. Kidney
trouble gets rapidly worse. Buy a box to-day,
price 3/6, or more economical size, 6/6.
Watch for such symptoms as puffiness
under the eyes, heaviness of the limbs, swollen
feet or ankles, foul breath, scalding pains,
gravel or stone. These symptoms usually
precede attacks of Rheumatism, Backache,
Lumbago, Sciatica or serious Kidney Trouble,
and much suffering and expense may be saved
by quickly getting a box of De Witt’s Pills
from the chemist and taking them as directed.

SPORTING
NOTIONS
Under the Whip
Sir Simper has to be numbered among
the many “paper certainties” to suffer
defeat in the Caulfield Cup. He started
at 7 to 4 —next to Manfred, who scored
at 5 to 4, the shortest-priced favorite in
history. Manfred carried 9st. 61b. as a
four-year-old. Sir Simper, of correspond-
ing age, had only 7st. 51b. While the
Maorilander. is, of course, not compar-
able with Ben Chaffey’s wonder horse
he probably would beat even a Phar
Lap with 291 b. pull in weight.
Bad luck of the worst description pre-
vented Sir Simper from winning—and
winning easily at that. Half a mile from
home Dempsey was just gathering his
mount together for a move towards the
front when Hostile dropped back on
Sir Simper, who had to be eased sharply
and dropped to the rear of the field. As
in the Toorak Handicap a week before,
Sir Simper made a wonderful finishing
effort. However, instead of winning on
this occasion he had to be content with
third place—three-quarters of a length
behind Farndale, who was half a neck
behind Journal. Great time —2min. 29sec.
Course bookmakers would not profit
greatly over the Caulfield Cup result, as
Journal was heavily backed on the day,
down to 7 to 1 ; but the double-event

operators rid themselves of slumber-dis-
turbing commitments. McShortodds is
a resourceful customer when driven into
a corner. In 1913 he would have been
in dire straits if Anna Carlovna, owned
by Eric Connolly, had won the Caulfield
Cup. He induced Fred Merton to start
Aurifer, and that Sydney-trained candi-
date downed the mare. Aurifer had fin-
ished third in the Metropolitan. There
is a parallel between what happened then
and last week. Eric Connolly went for
a royal win on Sir Simper, but was out-
generalled once more by ante-post
fielders. To strengthen the opposition to
Sir Simper they persuaded J. T. Cush to
make the Caulfield Cup the objective of
Journal, who was second in the Metrop.
Connolly must have groaned when the
numbers went up!
When Dempsey returned to the
jockeys’ room he almost trembled with
vexation and disappointment. At first
the little man refused to be interviewed,
but after simmering down he told a
woeful story. Sir Simper is field-shy, and
at the back of the course was shut in.
“When Hostile dropped back at the half-
mile,” said Dempsey, “I could do noth-
ing but drop back with him. Sir Sim-
per’s was a marvellous performance, but
circumstances beat us.” Exultant over
his success, Andy Knox stated that he
had deliberately allowed Journal to be
second-last at the mile post. Warned by
experience in the Toorak Handicap, he
waited for last run. During the whole
race Journal was inside only one horse.
Rogilla also had a good passage. Darby
Munro reckoned that he was going better
than any rival at the home turn, but the
weight stopped him then.
The success of Princess Cynthia in the
Mona Nursery was one of the features of
the day. This sister to Hall Mark is
held on lease from C. B. Kellow by
Gengoult Smith, the retiring Lord Mayor
of Melbourne. She is undersized, but
has inherited a full measure of speed
from Heroic, and left her rivals standing
over the last two furlongs.
Whernside, who landed the colts and
geldings’ division of the Gwyn Nursery,
was, like Princess Cynthia, an outsider.
Bred in M.L., he is by Grand Knight and
belongs to W. R. Kemball, whose colors
Lady Primrose carried with success in
the A.J.C. Gimcrack Stakes. Lady Prim-
rose is trained by George Jones and
Whernside by W. T. Hawthorne. The
Kemball gallopers in Melbourne are
divided between these two mentors.
Polly Speck, who, with St. Valorey, is
trained by Frank Godby for J. C. Camp-
bell, a wealthy Melbourne businessman,
annexed the Windsor Handicap in splen-
did style. Apart from the Cup result,
it was a deplorable day for backers, five
winners going out at from 10 to 1 to
15 to 1.
Caulfield Cup displays make the Mel-
bourne Cup look more open than it was.
Sir Simper must come strongly into the
betting now, and he may be better suited
by the two miles at Flemington. The
M.L. horse goes up 21b. in weight, but
that is a negligible factor. Farndale
also must be reckoned with very seri-
ously. Unless he wins the Derby—a not
impossible feat —this Curialis colt will
meet Sir Simper on 51b. better terms.
A. G. Hunter, who races Farndale in
conjunction with J. Fell, acted as in-
structor in racing form to the Duke of
Gloucester at Caulfield ; the Duke backed
Farndale. Most turf followers are
strongly of opinion that Theo will cap-
ture both the Victoria Derby and Mel-
bourne Cup. Peter Pan was decidedly
sore after galloping on Saturday morn-
ing, and is causing his trainer, Frank
McGrath, much anxiety.

Rosehill trainer Booth started five

Tingalba missed a place. His apprentice
Zensky rode the winners—a very promis-

lolaus has not been a lucky gelding for
the city businessman who races as “T.

ing comfortably in the Homebush Han-
dicap, at fives, in the very fast time (for

Roxburgh, was anchored by his Bst. 121 b.
The hot pace should have suited Deputy

Roman Spear (6 to 1) had to be ridden
right out to beat an outsider, Dunerc,
in the Varroville Handicap, Le Touquet
being a close third. Multudo, the fav-
orite, lost his chance soon after barrier-
rise, swinging out. Porcia essayed to
lead throughout, as she • had done at
Randwick, but Le Touquet had her
measure at the turn, and the Heroic mare
stopped to nothing. Raleigh and Cuban
Song were doing their best at the end.
Little Bill Wedgewood has had a
strenuous time during the past six
months, but the Bicolor stallion thrives
on racing. Made favorite for the Mac-
quarie Grove Handicap at 5 to 2, he
romped home by five lengths from Babili
and Tatyoon. Chatterelle was a dis-
appointment, but she was last away, and
struck trouble in running. Bill Wedge-
wood was saddled up again in the Home-
bush Handicap. He cannot run out a
fast 10 furlongs; a mile is his pet dis-
tance.
Two smart fillies, Trick (by Magpie)
and Feliswood (by Backwood), won the
heats of the Maiden Handicap. Trick
started at sixes, and she finished gamely
to beat Sir Rosewing and Tarvila. The
bookies got a clean sheet when Felis-
wood outstayed Warrain and Procure in
the second division. They quoted her
(nominally) at 33 to 1 ; her tote divs.
were £70 4s. 6d. for 10s. and £44 for 5s.,
and two other divs. came out of the pool.
Followers of Booth’s stable cleaned up
some nice wagers when the Spearhead
gelding Vice Royal annexed the Farm
Stakes. He was laid early at 15 to 1,
but closed at sevens. He came along at
the right end to win comfortably from
Havilah Belle and the favorite, Contact.
Vice Royal will win in better company ;
he looked as if racing will improve him.
(Continued on page 36.)
M.Q. (and Rafferty) Rules
Again there was capital wrestling' at
Sydney Stadium on Saturday night, and
again few people saw it. Meyers and Ali
Bey, 15-stoners, were the contestants;
each got a fall, and the debate ended in
a draw. A draw was also the verdict at
Leichhardt, where those friendly enemies
Lurich and Nylan tangled for about the
20th time. Here the offertory was much
better.
Ins and Outs
“Huon”: Possibly the best cricketer
Tassie has produced, apart from E. A.
McDonald, is now playing with the Adel-
aide club (he made 123 against Pros-
pect), and will make his bow in
Shield cricket against Queensland for
South Australia in Brisbane on Novem-
ber 30. Jack Badcock has certainly a
far better record to date than either
Darling or Bromley, and might advan-
tageously have supplanted one of them
in the last Australian XI. He is 20 this
year, and last season made his third
successive 1000 runs in association
matches. Against strong Victorian teams
—the matches count as first-class —his
tally was 25, 107, 274 and 71 n. 0., and
he topped off the season with a century
against the departing Australians.
* * * *
“Aigburth”: Australia’s old friend
Arthur Gilligan, developed nowadays
into a cricket-publicity hound of purest
ray serene, says the Marylebone club is
going to introduce five-day Tests in the
future. These will begin on Saturdays,
instead of Fridays. Apart from other ad-
vantages, the change will not interfere
more with county cricket than the present
four-day system. That cuts into two
county fixtures, and a five-day match
would do no more.
* * * *
The cricket season has opened with the
usual demands for adequate remunera-
tion. Ma will pay the old rate —though
a strong attempt was made to cut it —of
255. a day on tour, the Sabbath included.
At home the fee will be £1 a day, with
Sunday payments cut out. Umpires get
255. a day for inter-State games, and
scorers a pound. Colts and Second Eleven
men will draw the same money as the
big chaps, an innovation.
* * * *
“Senex”: I note that the Bradman case
has been made an excuse by hundreds of
females —I have a quid to say there isn’t
a man in the mob —for writing to the
papers to insist that the Board of Con-
trol should permit married cricketers in
future to be accompanied by their wives
on the “ministering angel” principle. I
am old enough to recall the days when
wives were allowed to travel with over-
seas and inter-State teams, and I was
on intimate terms with many of the play-
ers of those days. The impression that
remains is that teams with wives in them
were full of trouble from the start of
the tour, during the tour, and for ever
after, as far as individual members were
concerned. The women were always the
trouble-makers.. Precedence was a fine
point with them, and the captain’s wife
—if any —saw to it that her dignity was
maintained. Of course, the others went
for her tooth, and nail, and the unhappy
selectors and skippers had a devil of a
time from feminine lobbyists before
every match. No. The B. of C. didn’t
wipe out the feminine element through
sheer wantonness.
(<Continued on page 36.)
The Nineteenth Hole
The visiting English golfers played
their second match in Australia at Adel-
aide at the week-end on the R.A. club
links at Seaton. There was only time
for foursomes matches, and Australia won
the first, the other ending all square. The
Australian quartet, Winser, Horman, Mc-
Lachlan and W. Rymill, were a stiff
opposition for any team. A feature of
the day was the tremendous driving of
Garnett, which, however, was often as
wild as it was long. The manager of
the team is H. Gillen, secretary of St.
Andrews.
* * * *
“Hamilton”: Queensland golfers, left
howling out in the cold when the Aus-
tralian amateur team to play England was
chosen, are being placated with a brief
visit from the American professionals.
Businessmen took the hat round, and the
appearance money was guaranteed. The
Americans go up by air aftei landing in
Sydney on November 5, and play a
side of Bananaland professionals on
November 1. They return to Sydney
next day.
* * * *
“Far Hills”: Some Sydney enthusiasts,
fired by Bolger’s outstanding golf suc-
cesses, have been urging the young man
to invade the U.S.A. and clean up all
the gold reserve. Bolger would do well
to ponder. By common consent of
Australian golfers who have been abroad
and overseas players who have not spoken
with honeyed tongues, the Australian
courses are the easiest in the world. No
Australians have ever been able to make
a decent showing on courses like Deal,
Sandwich or one of the awful Scottish
contraptions. The American courses are
said to be 25 per cent, more difficult
than the worst in Britain. If I were
Bolger I would try England or even
Scotland first. Neither of them skins you
as close as the Yanks do.
* 4= * *
The amended itinerary of the English
amateur golfers after the first Test with
Australia at Sydney shows the tourists
at Brisbane on November 1, and then
back in Sydney to tackle Ma on Novem-
ber 5. The second Test starts in Mel-
bourne on November 10, and then the
centenary jamboree swallows them up
until November 24. Two matches in
Tassie follow, and the team embarks
from Sydney for M.L. after a game
against Victoria on December 8. The
Tests will comprise foursomes and
singles over 36 holes, and in matches
with States the rule will be foursomes
and singles over 18.

“Trevdee”: Although the placed kick
is indisputably the most accurate in
football it is rarely attempted in Aus-
tralian Rules nowadays. McNamara used
to kick placed goals from 80 yards out—
his record is 93 yards. Pratt, the present
champion goal-kicker of Victoria, relies
solely on punts.

Under the Whip
“Parmelia”: A Westralian horse-
reporter had an embarrassing few
moments in the presence of the Duke.
Introduced on the racecourse as his
State’s premier tipster, he was invited to
give the King’s son a winner. In his agi-
tation his shop teeth broke away from
their moorings and shot out in the direc-
tion of the ducal waistcoat. The owner
of the waistcoat waited patiently for the
frantic readjustment, and the smothered
guffaws of unfeeling onlookers gave him
the opportunity to slip away and back
the racecourse certainty. It lost.
* * * *
“D.E.”: Loyal as I am to Sydney, I
have to admit that Melbourne has out-
stripped it as a racing centre. Having
more amateur clubs, it gives richer
stakes, gets bigger and better fields, and
has far more owners who race for the
sport. It is not the A.J.C.’s fault that
Sydney is lagging behind, though it per-
mits too much leasing of horses; the
Government, with its excessive taxes and
its refusal to interfere with proprietaries,
is chiefly to blame. The Ring is perhaps
experiencing the worst effects. It has
dwindled to a shadow of what it was in
the flush days, and even the big men
hold little compared with what used to
pour into their bags. At the spring meet-
ing one of them hung up a sign to the
effect that he had a 10s. minimum. His
fellow-bagmen admired his proud ges-
ture, but they will nearly all lay the odds
to 55., and no doubles man will refuse
to write a 3s. wager on a ticket that costs
him threepence. “Will you take two shil-
lings?” a female punter was heard to
say at City Tatt.’s meeting. “Me?” re-
plied the Tommy ; “I’ll take bottle-tops.
Wotcher want?”
* * * *
“Wodgil”: With “D.E.” (B. 17/10/’34).
I have been pondering on that perfor-
mance of Theo in the Caulfield Guineas,
and I agree that it has been overrated.
His time for a mile was lmin. 40£sec.:
in the previous race Hall Mark ran nine
furlongs in lmin. 51|sec. ; in the race
following Sir Simper ran furlongs in
lmin. What a difference! So
far Theo has defeated only horses of his
own age, and, with perhaps one or two
exceptions, they seem to be a poor lot.
In the Chelmsford Stakes he finished 50
or 60 yards behind Rogilla and Peter
Pan. Certainly he was not strung up
for that race ; but neither was Heroic,
and he beat Gloaming ; neither was Phar
Lap, and he was just touched off by Mol-
lison. I question whether Rogilla would
have bothered Mollison at nine furlongs,
and he would have been easy meat for
Gloaming. Theo may make nonsense of
my opinion of him, but I submit that,
with a nailing good five-year-old (Peter
Pan) and four-year-old (Hall Mark) in
the field, each with a reasonable weight,
he is a false favorite for the Cup.
* * * *
J. E. Brien, for years a leading N.S.W.
owner and breeder, died in Sydney the
other day after a long illness. The best
of his racing string were Malt King,
Beragoon and Rampion. He imported
Rossendale and was owner of Pantheon,
who was responsible for Peter Pan.
* * * *
“Thormanby”: The last but one of
the big English autumn handicaps, the
Cesarewitch, run at Newmarket over the
teaser of 2\ miles, was won last week
by Enfield from a field of 27. The
winner went out at 7 to 1, second
and third being at 20’s and 33’s. Enfield
is so full of Carbine blood on both sides
that it would be impossible to stick a
pin in his pedigree without ticking Old
Jack’s name.
Ins and Outs
“Dud”: The N.S.W. cricket selectors
have chosen 22 players for the Sheffield
game which begins in Sydney on Novem-
ber 23. The Australian Eleven men
naturally picked themselves. But what
excuse is there for the selection of that
amiable but ancient second-class wicket-
keeper and batsman Love as Oldfield’s
offsider -when brilliant youngsters like
Easton, of Petersham, have to stand
down? The omission of players of the
calibre of Nutt and Leabeater and the
ignoring of Hunt, the only left-hand
bowler Australia has produced since
Hornibrook, are also typical. Hunt, just
returned from England, where he has
been very successful in League cricket,
is eligible to play, too.
* * * *
“Kew”: My idea for improving
cricket has been sent to the Marylebone
Club, and when it clicks The Bulletin
shall know. Permit bodyline bowling
without let or hindrance, but have a 10-
seconds check standing alongside the
umpire with a stopwatch and a gong.
When a bowler gets in one of his worst
the check will count 10. At the finish
of the count he bangs the gong and the
ambulance removes the stiff. The bats-
man shall be deemed as much out as
if he had been bowled, caught, r. 0., h.w.,
had handled the ball, interfered with
the fieldsman or incurred any other
of the numerous penalties.
* * * *
“Tenth Slip”: It is most irritating to
hear that Stan McCabe, one of our best
gate-money draws has badly sprained
something or other playing an idiotic
ship’s deck game, and may be unable to
take part in the Woodfull-Ponsford testi-
monial match or the earlier Sheffields.
It is gross carelessness on the part of his
managers to permit these foolish games.
Fancy Phar Lap’s owner letting him out
of his box to take part in a, deck hurdle
race! In his own sphere McCabe is as
“’Ullo, Bill! Who won?”
S? od a money-maker as Phar Lap was in
his, and, with his fellows, should never
have been let out of his loose-box, save
for a morning lead-round in a light
bridle.
* * * *
“Ibn el Issar”: Time was when the
coal-black Hubshi of the rolling eye and
the flashing teeth was as popular in
Hindu India, save as a guardian of the
purdah, as Jack Lang would be in the
Union Club. Yet we hear that the
Maharajah of Vizianagram, in the Mad-
ra s Presidency, where the population is
Hindu to a man, is entertaining Constan-
tine, and will play him with his team.
Connie ought to get on all right with the
non-beef-eating Hindus. The coon’s
favorite food is chicken, and murghi is
the Hindu cook’s middle name.
* * * *
“Snore”: Sydney Cricket Ground trus-
tee ? have a § ain made a generous gesture
which costs them nothing but incon-
ven iences a lot of other people. Several
old international cricketers have been
made honorary members, which is only
what , tbe y deserve, the list now totalling
25, with Fingleton and O’Reilly to come,
But there are so many brands of other
deadheads nowadays who have horned
in on one pretence or another that mem-
bers who pay for their tickets rarely find
room for their hurdies if they come late
to a big match. These gentry are particu-
larly noticeable during a professional
football season when there is a big match
with some North of England team on.
* * * *
“Amazon”: Another felon blow has
been struck by that ruffian man at our
sex. By common consent —of all the girls,
anyway —woman’s cricket in Australia is
very little behind ordinary club form.
With the tour of the English girls be-
ginning in this State on December 9 it
occurred to several of the leading player-
ettes who live in Balmain to ask the local
district club to allow them to practise
with the men. A brutal refusal resulted,
and indignation simmers high. Balmain
is full of steep, dark lanes, and male
cricket club officials wending their way
home after 6 p.m. are earnestly recom-
mended to walk in the middle of the road
where the light is brightest.
The Nineteenth Hole
The Australian open and amateur
championships have been a triumph for
lesser golfing lights. Bolger’s only big
success prior to his victory in the open
was in the N.S.W. professional champion-
ship in 1930. Yet he showed in this match
against a world-famous opponent like
Sarazen all the
aplomb of a Walter
Hagen or Harry
Vardon. The ama-
teur event, like the
open, saw the crack
inter-State players
fall early by the
wayside. The
veteran Eric
Apperly, who won
an Australian title
in 1920 and a
N.S.W. am a teur
championship be-
fore the war,
fought out the final,
this time with T.
S. McKay, one of
Ki 11 ara ’ s club
cracks, but other-
wise not much in
tiie news. McKay
won 5 and 4, aver-
aging two over 4’s
for the 32 holes
played.
Evidently feeling
the strain of his
hard battle with
Sarazen in the
open, Bolger was
beaten for the pro-
fessional cham-
pionship by Kelly,
who won the open
in Melbourne last
year when an un-
known professional
at Goulburn
(N.S.W.). The match was a neck-and-
neck struggle, with Kelly at his man the
whole time. Kelly won 2 and 1.
* * * *
“Hotham”: The refusal of the V.G.U.
to permit Sarazen and Kirkwood to play
in the Cabbage Garden before the cen-
tenary meeting for fear they would spoil
the gates was tempered by a climb-down
permitting the pair to give a show on
Kingswood course, well outside the
metropolitan area. The V.G.U. protests
that as it found all the money for bring-
ing the visitors over it is entitled to call
the tune. All the Victorians did was to
allot £3OOO of centenary funds in prizes
to be spread over the tournament. The
Yanks were expected to pay their own
heavy expenses and take their chance
of getting them back on unfamiliar
courses and against opponents who were
far from mugs. The Americans stood
pat on £1250 guarantee for travelling
expenses. Twice the V.G.U. refused,
and the visit was practically cancelled.
N.S.W. private interests stepped in and
found £750, and Victorian profes-
sionals came along with the balance;
the tour was thus made possible.
In face of this, the statement of the
V.G.U. president that N.S.W. had done
nothing to help is as flat as a fat man
who has fallen off the top of the Sydney
Commonwealth Bank building.
* * * *
The American professional golf team
for Australia left California by the
Mariposa on October 17. They are:
Runyan, Craig Wood, Shute, Cooper,
Diegel, Laffoon and Thomson. They
will give an exhibition at Honolulu on
their way over. With them on the ship
are the English tennis players Perry and
Hughes, as well as Misses Round, Lyle
and Dearman. South African Kirby is
also of the party.
“Cottesloe”: The English amateur
golfers sportingly hopped off the Orford
at Fremantle and took on W.A. men.
Thirty-six holes of singles were played.
Scott and McLean won for England
from Scribe and Hill. Forbes, the W.A.
amateur champion, beat the long-driving
Bourne, 3 and 2, and Rogers downed
Garnett, 5 and 4.
* * * *
The first amateur golf match between
Australia and an overseas team will be
played when this country engages the
English amateurs on October 27-29 at
the R.A. club’s course, Kensington
(N.S.W.). The selectors have chosen a
strong team. Ryan, of Victoria, is
skipper, and left-hander Williams is the
other Victorian. Ma is represented by
T. S. McKay, who as winner of the Aus-
tralian amateur title picks himself, and
Jim Ferrier. All are too well known to
dwell on. The English quartet is Michael
Scott (capt.), McLean, Bourne and
Garnett, about the best bunch of ama-
teurs England boasts at present.
* * * *
“Hayseed”: Sarazen and Kirkwood
have been astonishing the natives in
N.S.W. and Queensland, and on the long
and high-class courses at Tamworth and
Toowoomba have been most unfilial in
their attitude towards poor old par—see
it? But they met their St. Helena at a
little N.S.W. dorp which has sand instead
of grass for its “greens,” the local goats
not permitting the use of herbage. It
was the first experience the pair had
ever had of the substitute, and both
crashed. The locals make no attempt to
play a proper pitch shot to these “greens”
—they just dribble the ball along the
ground with a putter. The Americans
kept to the conventional “poached-egg”
drop on the pin, a shot at which both
excel on grass. In every case the
egg refused to stay put and went career-
ing on its wild way.
*** . *
“Susie Swattit”: N.S.W. golferinas
have been spitting because the cats on
the other side of the Murray have made
no provision for associate golfers during
the centenary beano, though champion-
ships for pretty well everything else, from
wheeling a pram to knitting a pullover
for the latest sheik, are included in the
interminable programme. A couple of
women’s matches during the nine days
of centenary golf in Melbourne could
easily have been squeezed in.
Racquet and Bawl
“Rev. Knucklebone”: What may be
styled the “Perry”nnial rumor that the
holder of the Wimbledon, Davis Cup
and American championship titles will
shortly turn professional has bobbed up
again. After Wimbledon one O’Brien,
of America, offered the young English-
man £lO,OOO to tour the States for a
few months in his circus. Perry refused
because the money wasn’t good enough
to pay him for the ostracism that awaited
him in his social circle in England.
To-day, on the eve of his departure for
Australia, Perry has received genuine
offers, including £lO,OOO from Tilden,
totalling £35,000, the last being £25,000

More Miles... More Comfort...and Extra Safety
make latest PERDRIAU Australia's best tyre
investment
FLATTER TREAD DISTRIBUTES
WEIGHT SCIENTIFICALLY
Under load tiae flatter, broader tread
achieves complete road-contact with-
out distortion —while massive shoul-
ders ease road-strain evenly into
sidewalls preventing failure at
flexing point. The benefits are in-
creased mileage, better traction,
greater safety.
ADDITIONAL RUBBER
in long-wearing tread
Long after ordinary treads have
worn dangerously smooth, the
deeply-moulded Perdriau will still
be good for thousands of extra safe
miles. Tread rubber is double tough
«~and there’s more of it!
Soon all Australia will be discussing this
latest and greatest Perdriau tyre. Its
more massive build, its extension and
improved application of the famous
double triangle road-grip more than
match to-day’s higher speeds—and set
new records in safety, mileage and
comfort.
mmmm
“BALANCED” CORDS
make Perfect Casing
Perdriau cords actually float in
“live” resilient rubber —preventing
transmission of destructive heat
from cord to cord. In addition,
each cord has a perfect “balance”
of tensile strength and elasticity.
Pesult —cooler running and unique
resistance to blowouts.
PARENTS APPRECIATE
this Extra Safety
How much wiser to obviate road-
risks of worn tyres by fitting a full
set of new Perdriaus. “Balanced”
cords resist every cause of blowouts,
and, even though you corner at speed,
that broader, flatter tread holds the
road like a limpet. Perdriau’s extra
safety costs no more. Your local
dealer still quotes the lowest prices
ever known, and can fit immediately.
DEALERS HAVE STOCKS
If you are interested in more miles, more
comfort, extra safety, call at your
nearest tyre dealer’s and ask to see your
size in these latest Perdriaus. Stocks
are available all over Australia at the
lowest prices on record.

if Perry doesn’t think of his future
now none of his present adorers will lift
a little finger to help him 10 years hence.
Bunny Austin is of the same opinion.
Perpend, you young Australian gentle-
men who have abandoned: a school
career for a job in a tennis-goods shop.
That will last just as long as you keep up
first-class tennis; that gone you can
chase the dole.
“Brass Addler”: Out of the wild and
howling hullabaloo concerning Perry
and his intentions as to professionalism
emerges one definite trumpet blast from
the harried Englishman. He says he will
definitely tour Australia as arranged with
the rest of the English team. After that,
Perry declines to commit himself.
“Cash Amateur”: That hint that
Perry’s persistent pothunting in the
minor Californian tennis tournaments (B.
17/10/’34) was likely to make him stale
is not untimely. In his later singles he
has had trouble to beat unknowns. The
other day he was joined in California
by his Davis Cup doubles partner, G. P.
Hughes. The pair, invincible in most
company, were handsomely licked by
Stoeffen and Mako, and next day Make
outed Perry, 6-0, 6-2.

“Roland Garros”: According to Me.
Grath, just returned from Europe, France
has a budding Cochet in a 17-year-old
lad named Destremeau. Mac beat this
chap himself in the junior championship
of France last year, but says that he
has now come on beyond belief. With
Boussus developed into a champion, it
looks as if France is well on the way to
building up a new Davis Cup team. One
wishes the same could be said of Aus-
tralia.
* * * *
“Toowong”: For years writer has
been barracking in The BuLLETiN'for the
adoption of a world-standard tennis
court. As it is to-day, Britain, America,
Australia, M.L. and Canada are the only
countries playing on grass courts, and
the pace and character of these courts
vary beyond knowing. All through
Europe, South Africa, Japan and Italy
especially, hard courts are used ; and here
again they vary as much as the grass.
There is a material now being used all
over the world which gives absolutely
uniform results in all weathers. Some of
the European countries, France in par-
ticular, are using it. There is no reason
save prejudice why the I.T.F. should not
make a standard court compulsory.
Miscellaneous
“Worm”: Those people dreading the
arbitrary powers proposed to be granted
to the N.S.W. police under an Act not
yet passed might consider the very con-
siderable ones they possess or get away
with already. Fishing illegally in the
Nepean River at Penrith, some sports
doffed their clothes and put on bathing-
suits so as to claim they were only swim-
ming if caught. A constable came
along and, with that obtuse cunning which
marks the species, traced the clothes to
a hollow tree. He removed the lot of
these to the police station —quite illegally
—and left the bathers to it. The shades
of night had long fallen when some of
Penrith’s leading citizens might have been
seen sneaking up back streets in costumes
which would not have been tolerated in
Cronulla. The story ends here, tem-
porarily at least.
* * * *
“Mike”: R. Pratt, South Melbourne’s
goal-kicking hero, failed in the final
against Richmond to win the Australian
record. Pratt scored two goals, bringing
his total for the season to 150. The
record was won by G. Doig, of East
Fremantle club, who reached 152 with
three goals against West Perth for the
Westralian final.
“Hotham”: The Henley -on - Yarra
people have been worrying over the huge
entry for their meeting on November 3.
At first it was thought that two days,
the first for preliminary heats, would
have to be plotted. The regatta will
begin at noon instead of 3 p.m., and
heats start remorselessly at three-minute
intervals instead of the customary five.
It sounds very nice, but those much
exposed to rowing men will recognise
that keeping to a rigid timetable will
require iron discipline. Far better if the
crews had been “seeded,” tennis fashion.
* * * *
“Splash”: There is apparently one
Australian athlete with his head screwed
on the right way. Swimmer Noel Ryan
has turned in the game, though this
means missing the great centenary meet-
ing in Melbourne in January. Ryan says
he has been neglecting his business for
sport, which is not likely to keep him in
his old age. No doubt he has in mind
a swimmer even more famous than he
who dropped a very solid substance for
the will-o’-the-wisp of world’s champion-
ships and has every reason to repent m
sackcloth and ashes to-day.
* * * *
“Trudgeon”: Dominion swimmers have
long been at loggerheads with the Feder-
ation Internationale Natation Amateur,
Two years ago this body declared ail
paid attendants professionals, whether
they were swimmers or not. America has
ignored the law from the day it was
made, and its professional lifesavers, or
“life guards,” as they are called over
there, are allowed to compete as ama-
teurs in American championships, though
they cannot represent Uncle in inter-
national contests. F.I.N. (call it that) has
funked tackling Uncle, while severe on
other people infringing the rule. There
will be a conference of Australian ama-
teur swimming unions in Melbourne in
January, and a lively discussion of
F.l.N.’s attitude is promised, with definite
action to follow, perhaps.


BUSINESS, ROBBERY, ETC.
Still Ailing
Travellers returning to Australia bring
dismal reports of conditions overseas.
In the heart of London, at present one
of the busiest cities in Europe, there is
less visible poverty than in Sydney but
in the poorer residential areas conditions
are still very bad. An Australian com-
ing back from the Old Country met a
countryman who had just crossed the
Atlantic to catch the boat from Tilbury.
“Yes,” he said, “London’s bad enough,
but you should see the States. The Gov-
ernment is going head over heels into
debt to relieve the position, but unem-
ployment is still a tremendous problem.”
In May, 1933, the percentages of un-
employed, as supplied by U.S. trade-
unions, were 31 p.c. wholly and 21 p.c.
partly out of work. A year later the
figures were 24 p.c. and 24 p.c. respec-
tively—thanks to Government assistance
there had been a switch-over of 3 p.c.
from the wholly- to partially-unemployed
list, the real improvement amounting to
4 p.c.
In Britain 13.6 p.c. of those on the
unemployment insurance records were
out of work last May, easily the most
heartening figure for four years. At the
beginning of 1933 the percentage was
18.8. But in France and Belgium the
position has seldom been worse, while
Italy, despite great efforts by Mussolini,
can point to very little improvement
since the darkest days of the depression.
Germany, though its employment-ex-
change statistics acknowledge 2\ millions
out of work, shows improvement from
the five millions of a year earlier. These
figures, however, are probably not as
“good” as they look. Even in the Bal-
kans, notorious for cheap labor, and
Poland the position has slipped back.
This state of world affairs vitally
affects Australia. Busy little Japan uses
most of the wool she imports for her
own use, and is a consistent customer ;
but Britain aims at reselling a large part
of her purchases from us to Con-
tinental countries in the form of
tops and manufactured goods. Germany,
apart from placing an embargo on
such imports and those of the raw
materials, pleads inability to pay Brad-
ford for what she has already bought.
Currency cranks blame gold for this
amazing tangle of trouble. It can be
more rightly sheeted home to unwise
finance, war and —debt. Public and
private finance in nearly every coun-
try is top-heavy. Gold failed to
stop the world from committing its
blunders, and it isn’t likely to help much
in pulling it out of the mess. If countries
could be declared bankrupt and their
assets sequestrated as simply as in the case
of individuals the World would probably
have cut its losses and started off afresh
long ago. But as things are the seizure
of one country’s possessions by a creditor
country would mean war.
Fact and Fancy
Balance sheets, price indexes, golf-
handicap tables, latitude, longitude, ex-
change, the right way to prune fruit trees
—all these matters present great and
seemingly insuperable problems to the
uninitiated.
Yet, after all, a little observation and
experience, with commonsense added,
will demonstrate how the pruning-knife
can become an aid to the backyard plum-
tree instead of a menace ; that a balance
sheet is merely a statement of what a
person or firm owns and what it owes —
the more it owns and the less it owes being
so much to the good ; and that .exchange
is just a way of expressing the number
of another country’s coins or notes that
can be obtained for a certain number of
our own country’s coins and notes. The
expert in any of these matters endeavors
to find a simple parallel to the problem
in hand, and reduces the whole question
to as plain terms as possible.
Not so with your Douglas Creditites,
other currency theorists, taxation com-
missioners and representatives of weak
life-assurance offices. The more com-
plicated the system or argument the more
scope there is for bluffing—sometimes
the currency theorist is just as much
bluffed as his victim. Unless an experi-
mentalist is able to explain himself in
commonsense language he should give
up ; unless a life-assurance canvasser is
able to explain himself in terms of what
you get in return for your money, he’s
not worth bothering with.
Many people have a terror of figures.
In their schooldays they were very likely
coached in algebraical theory which they
never properly understood, were initiated
in the elements of double-entry book-
keeping without ever connecting it in
their minds with a real business —we are
all too carefree at this stage to worry
much about £ s. d. —and after leaving
school realised that what theoretical stuff
they did learn at school was gradually
slipping from their memory.
When confronted with a balance sheet
or a currency theory, they search in a
mental panic for what might be retained
in their memory of that which they
learnt at school. Those to whom their
school studies are still just theory are
generally misled, and take the view most
appealing to their imagination. It is only
those who are able to reduce theory to
ordinary everyday commonsense that are
able to form an opinion ; and it is sur-
prising how few —particularly currency
theorists —can reduce problems to com-
monsense.
Farmers and Debt
Maoriland intends to establish a farm
mortgage corporation to raise money
around 3 p.c. and lend it to land men at
4 p.c. or thereabouts. N. S. Wales Pre-
mier Stevens proposes to introduce legis-
“If you’d hurried you ought to be there and back now, Jacky.”
“No fear, boss — can’t be in two places at once.”
lation “to establish means to deal with
mortgages as between debtor and credi-
tor.” Not only the Maoriland scheme,
but other countries’ experiences are to
be considered.
Agricultural and pastoral finance is a
great problem the world over. All farm
products are cheap, and many farm
debts were incurred when prices for
wheat, etc., encouraged the payment of
high prices for agricultural properties
and plant. In 1919-20 the average Aus-
tralian rate for wheat was Bs. 9d. a
bushel, from 1924 to 1926 it was over
65., while for the last four years it has
been generally under 3s.
The Wheat Commission estimated that
there were 70,000 wheatgrowers in Aus-
tralia. It is a pursuit which requires con-
siderable capital, and, according to the
Commission, “there is evidence of ex-
travagance in high-priced land, farming
machinery, tractors and motor-cars....
during the post-war years of boom prices
and good wheat yields.” The farmer, of
course, wasn’t on his own in this regard ;
the borrowing boom made high prices
almost inevitable. When trouble arose,
“the increase in debts occasioned by fall-
ing prices.... tended to make the
farmers adopt more risky practices. The
‘Grow More Wheat’ campaign of 1930-
31 also contributed to a general increase
in farmers’ debts.”
The cost of borrowing during the
boom was generally 7 or 8 p.c. The
present overdraft rate is down to 4 or
5 p.c. But even on present-day rates
the average interest cost to the wheat-
grower is around 7d. a bushel. And 30
p.c. have to pay Is. or more.
The Commission calculated that a debt
of £lOOO represented 4499 bushels of
wheat when the price was 4s. 6d. a
bushel; at 2s. it represented a debt of
10,000 bushels. And, though the interest
rate has been reduced from 7 p.c. to
5 p.c. or less, it would now require 500
bushels to pay the bill, where 310 satis-
fied it with wheat at 4s. 6d. The inves-
tigators came to the conclusion that “the
producer section of the industry is carry-
ing a debt burden which is overwhelm-
ing under present conditions.”
So much for the wheatgrower. He is
the chief care of the moment, with
liabilities of £138,000,000. But the wool-
grower’s state demands attention, though
one good year has done something to
rehabilitate him. Other agricultural in-
dustries are not generally prosperous.
Mr. Stevens says that the M.L. scheme
indicates “the need for some corporation
that would carry the burden of adjust-
ment between debtor and creditor.” At
present manufacturers and the industrial
classes look to the great primary pro-
ducers of the world to absorb more
manufactured goods and relieve unem-
ployment in manufacturing countries.
The growers of raw materials and food-
stuffs in their turn require a greater con-
sumption in industrial countries to en-
able them to buy more than the bare
necessities of life. With costs and prices
out of equilibrium* largely due to over-
capitalisation and heavy debts, we move
very slowly towards a solution.
Stock Exchange Commissions
“Mining Shareholder” (Melbourne):
In the midst of the busiest and most
sustained mining-share boom they have
ever experienced, Stock Exchange com-
mittees of Melbourne, Adelaide and Syd-
ney have found time to chide the Great
Boulder directors for proposing to raise
their fees. It is largely a domestic matter
for the shareholders. As one, I con-
sider the proposed increase of little
significance compared with the advan-
tages which the board’s wise management
has brought to us in recent times.
What is far more important to the wel-
fare of gold-mining as a whole, and of
shareholders in particular, is the extor-
tionate commissions charged by share-
brokers on dealing in gold-mining scrip.
A Stock Exchange is a privileged
body of limited membership, its mem-
bers enjoying without legislative con-
trol an extremely valuable monopoly,
laying down their own rules and
fixing their own scale of charges.
One of these rules is that a client must,
pay both a buying and selling commis-
sion on all shares in mining cos., whether
making a profit or a loss, and irrespec-
tive of the period in which the shares
are held. This is doing more to disgust
people who lean to modest speculation
than anything which could possibly be
done by the directors of all the listed cos.
combined.
Gold-mining shares are being turned
over in millions, and the commissions
taken by sharebrokers since the revival
began are grotesquely out of proportion
to the value of the services they render
or the risks they take. Clients buy and
sell so rapidly that the both-ways com-
mission demanded must make sharebrok-
ing the most fantastically profitable of
all businesses. Before lecturing directo-
rates on the proprieties, let the Stock
Exchanges engage in some real and bene-
ficial reform within their own ranks.
Amalgamated Wireless shows a record
profit of £137,934 for the year just closed,
£55,763 better than the previous year.
This in spite of the fact that the co. no
longer gets a cut out of wireless license
fees. Part of last year’s profit is said to
be a non-recurring windfall—probably
cricket service revenue ; but the Beam
service continues to “carry satis-
factory volumes of traffic.” The wireless
telephone is now showing a very
small profit, while the transmission of
photos, over the Beam has been in-
augurated. A.W.A. and its affiliates em-
ploy 1500 people and paid over £300,000
in wages last year.

“Jackaburra”: Compulsory users of
Queensland railways rubbed their eyes
hopefully the other day when the papers
reported Minister Dash’s announcement
of freight concessions. It turned out to
be a false alarm; the revision applies
only to goods conveyed in truckloads, as-
sorted loads of which are to be allowed
the truckload rate irrespective of class —
previously goods had to be of an equally-
or higher-rated class to qualify. Some
large graziers will secure relief, which
no one will grudge, but the small
man can’t talk in truckloads. The scale
of minimum charges for small consign-
ments is outrageous.

the durability of cypress pine (B.

around the grave of W. C. Staunton, who
was killed on the road by lightning. The
fence has had no attention since, but is
still in perfect condition.

“H.S.”: “Synthetic wool,” is it?
Analysis of a sample received in Mel-

sulphur content, clearly indicating that
the material is mainly of animal origin.
A very small proportion of foreign fibres
was found. The sample seems to have
been mostly natural wool!

Sydney has plenty of repertory shows
but little talent behind them, though the
public support which they get suggests
that a company of world standard like
the Abbey Players of Dublin could do
well for itself. Last week a trio of vague
attempts to interpret first-class material
drew good houses, but none rose above
mediocrity. The Independent Players,
ut ° n , Barn f. s Hi?
Fire, faded to realise the essential dif-
ference between comedy and farce, with
the result that the piece was robbed of
at S ti, e ude^ce W
and O. T. Bisset, as Colonel Grey, were
exceptions. Doris Fifton Was a rather arti-
ficial Alice Grey, and Eva Kuraz a too-
sophisticated Amy. The piece runs for
three more Saturdays. Scott Alexander’s
elucidation of Bertha Grahams The
Twisters introduced a more modem
touch : the sugar-daddy uncle and the
gold-digger-played effectively by Gwen
Coleman. St. James s Hall saw T
Vagabonds struggle with Chesterton and
Neale s Love Game. For most
the cast the effort was too much but
Lloyd C larke, as Jack Armstrong, though
a little youthlul in appearance, an
Meroya Plummer were competent and
amusing. ¥
A section of the crowd at the initial
performance of the Grenadier Guards
Band at Melbourne Town Hall was
sadly disappointed because the players
did not wear their largely-advertised bus-
bies. The band gave a good mixed pro-
gramme with the perfection of trained
musicians, led by the baton of Major
G. Miller. The instruments were such as
compose any first-class band, but, to the
horror of several ultra-classicists, what
appeared to be a couple of saxophones
had been included. Unlike Sousa, Miller
takes no very serious liberties with the
composer. He presents the works as
written, save for individual musicianly
effects which may sometimes improve
and sometimes mar. For instance, the
hastening of certain passages in the
Toreador’s Song in “Carmen” was new
to Melbourne and suggested that the
band had got into second gear. The
soloists, G. Walsh, cornet, and G.
Hughes, xylophone, are masters of their
instruments. The programme was
arranged to meet all tastes, and included
Bizet, Massenet, Rimsky-Korsakov, Liszt
and our own Percy Grainger, with a
Scottish fantasia to reach Melbourne’s
Scotchbyterian soul,

were ridden to a genuine standstill by
tbe champions, who include two gi s
one Yank and one Aussie,
Among the men, the Yanks provided
a better proportion of those who kept
their seats, though several of qur lads
had extremely hard luck, especially one
abo. rider who was scraped off just as
he was completing a magnificent ride,
There were no casualties, but an Aus-
tralian had a narrow escape when his
mount threw him and jumped on him
with all four hoofs. Fortunately the
hoofs landed right around him like the
legs of a table.
The uncharted item which brought the
loudest applause was the appearance of
the grey-moustached little man who
drove his ramshackle cart with three
donkeys round the arena —the same cart
and the same donkeys which he had
driven all the way from Mt. Magnet
(W.A.) to Melbourne to take part in the
centenary.

“Kaloa”: The new Commonwealth
map of Australia is the best yet issued.
It is detailed and clearly printed, and it
has moved places which were hiding in
the scrub a few dozen miles from actual-
ity into their right locations. The grad-
ing of the type in the names is excellent,
but needs some explanatory note for
students. By European standards, for
instance, Bauhinia Downs (N.T.) looks
like quite a sizable village, whereas it
consists of an empty galvanised-iron
shanty and a waterhqle. Boorooloola,
which has an ancient pub, a policeman
and six or seven permanent white inhab-
itants, unless there has been a rush
thither in the last year or two, appears
larger on the map than thriving Queens-
land townships like Palmwoods, Eu-
mundi (which Canberra spells Eumundie)
and Wyreema. And Barrow Creek, a
telegraph station with a pub, a store
and a camel camp, and Deep Well
are made out to be bigger than Thargo-
mindah (Q.) and Molong (N.S.W.). In
fact, the almost empty Deep Well is
printed in larger letters than its capital,
Alice Springs. On the Oodnadatta-
Adelaide line settlements which consist
of a shed from which an itinerant gang
occasionally shovels the sand are made to
look like prosperous hamlets. And who
teaches these officials to spell? Queens-
land Statistician spells “Yeulba”; the
Commonwealth map spells “Yuleba.”
Other authorities plump for Yeulbah and
Yulebah.
* * * *
“Kieta”: “Kaloa” (B. 19/9/’34) will
find the Rabaul graves of our first casual-
ties in the Great War far different now
from his description of them as they
were years ago. I was there in June,
1932, and the little cemetery in the
Botanical Gardens was in a beautiful
condition. Everything was tidy, clean
and restful: not a sound to break the
hallowed silence but the swish of the
black boy’s bush broom as he swept the
paths between the graves.

“G.C.”: Doc. Rossell, the A.I.M. fly-
ing doctor, recently did his longest trip-
-500 miles from Cloncurry to Innamincka,
out among the sandhills-, where a woman
lay desperately ill. Navigation was diffi-
cult owing to a thick haze and drizzling
rain. Mr. Anderson, the A.I.M. radio
man, went with the doctor to enable
him to keep in touch with the sister-in-
charge of Innamincka hostel. This was
done with a tiny portable receiving and
transmitting set —the invention of Mr.
Alf Trager. During the trip a message
was picked up at Cloncurry from Inna-
mincka that the patient had collapsed
and the doctor’s advice was required
urgently. The message was relayed to
the ’plane. The doctor, still flying hard,
prescribed. An operation saved the
woman’s life.
* H: ifs
“Travel Stain”: Weather has been
fairly good during the past month or so
in the N.Q. sugar areas, although, as I
predicted earlier (B. 16/’5/34), flood
rains in the beginning of the season have
spoilt the yield. And the strike bar-
ometer is stormy. At Mossman there
has been a decline in quality as well as
quantity, the March cyclone being
blamed. The Cairns mills are handling re-
duced tonnages, too, especially at Babinda,
where they have the lowest on record since
1924. The three Innisfail mills will treat
about 137,000 tons less than last year,
although Tully is bearing up to estimates
well in regard to plant cane. Ratoons
are expected to be lower. In the Her-
bert things were going well until Weil’s
disease appeared. Further south con-
ditions are healthier. At Mackay the
output of three mills is likely to be 30
per cent, over peak quota, and the two-
pool system will operate. The same
applies to Bundaberg, and at Bingera the
amount over peak year will probably be
67,000 tons. The grower can either
allow it to stand over or let portion go
into No. 2 pool for payment.

“Vestal Virgin”: The organisers of
the Charities Ball which the Duke is to
attend in Brisbane found themselves
faced with a momentous problem:
“Should there be an age limit for de-
butantes?” It arose when it was dis-
covered that applications were being re-
ceived from ladies of 35. The treasurer,
who has a financier husband, solved the
problem. She pointed out' that a guinea
from a girl of 30 was just as useful as
one from a girl of 18, and the committee
left it at that. She might have reinforced
her case by referring to aboriginal tribal
custom, under which a lady or gentle-
man who has failed to go through initia-
tion can still be an infant-in-law at 80.
* * * *
“Annan”: “Endeavour” (B. 26/9/34)
is a‘pessimist. Certainly rents are cheap
in Cooktown, but the houses at 2s. per
week consist of two rooms ; larger places
bring up to 10s. The reference to the
bank is incorrect. The ’Wales has now
bought the old Q.N. building ; the only
other bank building has been let for a
long time at £1 per week furnished.
Peanut-farming is on the increase, the
proprietor of the picture show has
imported a talkie plant and a southern
co. proposes to instal electric light. The
five hotels, four general stores and
other businesses all must be making a
do of things, otherwise they couldn’t
“I'm sure your husband loves you still. How quickly he followed when you
cleared off with Ako!”
“So he did—till he found it wasn’t his pig Ako had taken.”
keep going. When the road from the
south comes through the district should
jump ahead, since it has plenty of good
country available. Transport difficulties
are the handicap.

“Vic”: Only 356 of the 550,000 males
in Queensland celebrated last New
Year’s Day in quod, and only seven
ladies out of 450,000 made their sea-
sonal resolutions behind bars. A lot
more had been sentenced, of course —
2038 males and 81 females —but most
of them were in only for a few
weeks. It is fairly even betting when
you are arrested as to whether you get
off or not. In the Supreme Court during
the last year for which figures are avail-
able (’32), 209 persons were convicted
and 32 of them were bound over;
92 were acquitted ; in 98 cases “no true
bill” was found by the Attorney-Gen-
eral’s Department, which is run by the
only non-legal Attorney-General in the
Empire. It seems a pretty heavy pro-
portion if magistrates who commit for
trial are as competent as they seem to be.

“Mulga Mick”: Talk about dear
shouts! The day following the triennial
races at the Katherine (N,T.) in 1913
saw the groggery depleted of all stingo
and the population badly needing a hair
of the dog that bit them. My mate and
I went to the Chinese camp in search
of a reviver, and the wily owner, realis-
ing our desperation, demanded a tenner
for the only bottle of square gin he had.
As the nearest pub was at Pine Creek,
over 50 miles away, we had to pay. Six
years later, when I’d struck a rich opal
patch at Coober Pedy (Stuart Ranges,
S.A.), I felt exuberant enough to send
a £lOO cheque to the local “Do-drop-in”
with an order for all the grog he’d got
as a shout for the boys. That night will
be long remembered in Centralia. We
polished off nine cases of whisky, the
singing woke the Mayor of Rumjungle,
and I got £1 change out of my cheque.

“J.A.8.”: During the 40 years that
the late Jim Clark employed 1500
pearlers from Cape Melville to Broome,
he never had a boy taken by a shark.
The closest call was when one trod on
a sleeper which left the marks of its
molars on his diving-suit. Until the
great gale near Cape Melville, when the
“Pearl King” lost 45 luggers and most of
his best skippers, his fleet had only one
fatality. Jim Clark went to Somerset in
’B2 to join partners with cricketer Jar-
dine’s uncle, but, not being able to hit it
with the Scot, went out on his own.
Later, with Peter Tait (now a Common-
wealth Bank director), he became one of
the largest holders of freehold land in
Australia. Tait’s father was a tailor in
Brisbane, and Clark a salesman of J.
Campbell and Sons in the same city. As
a deck-quoit player the “Pearl King” had
few equals—he beat me 21 to 3, and I
once held my own with Bill Peterson, of
the Niagara, said to be the champion of
the Pacific.

“Pandanus”: Old-timers may sigh for
the golden port of 40 pubs, but “En-
deavour” (B. 26/9/’34) needs correcting
when he states that Cooktown’s income
is now mostly old-age pensions. Even
in Cooktown 300 persons would hardly
support five hotels and three fair-sized
stores. “Endeavour” forgets the Bloom-
China Camp, Rossville and other
tin-mining townships, the few fossickers
along the Palmer, the cattle stations to
the north and west, the fruit- and peanut-
growers along the Endeavour and Mc-
Ivor rivers and the beche-de-mer and
trochus-shell luggers which provision
there. Cooktown still has a fair harbor,
and will always remain the Cape York
port. Take away its back country, how-
ever, and it would become a name on
the map.
* t- * *
“Natara”: Port Moresby buys its
steaks and roasts from a butchery owned
by the co. which runs the talkie theatre.
Recently, as I dredged up my three shil-
lings for a seat, 1 saw in the butcher’s
shop the carcass of a freshly killed
bulumakau on the hooks. Near the
entrance to the theatre stood two bill-
boards. On one was an advertisement of
the “star” film of the moment; on the
other was “Fresh Beef To-morrow. Order
Now!” I lodged an order for the
morrow’s steak and joint, wandered into
the theatre and took my seat —to spend
the next few hours watching Wallace
Beery counterfeit the wrestler Polakai in
“Flesh.”
“Australia Jane’s” Budget
Maoriland’s G.-G., Lord Bledisloe, flew
from Sydney to Brisbane to spend two quiet
days with his old friend, our Sir Leslie.
Lady Bledisloe, attractive in beige wool-de-
Chine trappings and a small hat to match,
came, too.
When Lady Wilson and daughter Marjorie
arrive in Brisbane from England they will have
only about enough time to pack up again, as
they are off to Asia by the Marella on
January 9 with Sir Leslie. The party will be
away for about two months.
W. H. Cumming, for the Queensland Press
Institute, welcomed Archbishop and Mrs.
Wand and Miss . Wand at afternoon-tea at
Rowe’s caf£. Mrs. W. Young, secretary of
the institute, acted as hostess, and pink radi-
ance roses decked the tables.
Brisbane also has entertained Brigadier-Gen-
eral Home, Adjutant of the King’s Bodyguard,
and Mrs. Home. Mrs. Home is a Queens-
lander, a daughter of the late W. K. Knox
D’Arcy, of Mt. Morgan, and founder of Anglo-
Persian Oil. The General is a tall, soldierly
man, with a complete absence of side and a
very warm heart for the Digger. The State
council of the R.S.S.I.L.A. took him to lunch
at Lennon’s.
Mary Taylor, who has been a showring rider
since the age of eight, is in Melbourne
competing in various equestrienne events. She
is as good as a man at cattle-drafting, and
the high jump is nothing in her young life.
Algeranoff, of the Russian Ballet, had a
crowded audience at Peggy Chauncey’s studio
on Sunday night week, when he gave a short
history of Japanese dancing. Algeranoff has
lived for many years both in Japan and in
Russia; but he really is English-born. Enid
Dickson (Madame Treuthardt) introduced the
speaker, and Dandre, of the Russian Ballet,
also said a few words.
The Brisbane Equestrienne Club held its
second annual dance at the Belle Vue, and the
horsy girls showed that they are just as
graceful on the dancing floor as in riding togs.
Secretary Doris Heindorff received the guests,
and wore black ring velvet, with a wreath of
silver leaves on her fair hair. Mr. P. J. Symes
(president) and Miss McKale, who looks after
the club’s cash, also lent a helping hand.
Lord Mayor Jones, his wife and daughters
Dorothy and Ina will leave for Melbourne by
the Canberra on October 27.
Dr. and Mrs. Roger Cope flew up from
Goulburn. The lady was a Parry-Okeden,
daughter of the late Commissioner of Police.
Mrs. Charlie Persse, of Tabragalba, another
sister, also will spend a few days with them
at Redcliffe, where the Parry-Okeden home is
a historic landmark.
Queensland Uni. is to have a new library, to
cost over £65,000. A decently adequate
library is badly needed.
To retire on December 21, Miss Jean Carra-
way, who has just finished the 50th year of
her residence in Queensland and her service
with the Education Department. Ex-pupils
all over Queensland remember the lady with
affection and respect. She was born in
Birmingham, and educated at St. Chad’s
Convent. Cooktown was her first post as head
teacher, and during her first Christmas holi-
days most of her school was removed by a
cyclone. She was also head teacher at Ipswich
West and at the Valley girls’ school, and for
the past 10 years has been in charge of Kelvin
Grove girls and infants.
Ninety-seven per cent, of the money sub-
scribed to the Social Service League is re-
turned in relief. This fact was mentioned by
Lord Mayor Jones at the fourth annual meet-
ing of the league, at which Mrs. Percy Pease
was re-elected president. A total of 8579
days’ work was made available for unemployed
women during the year, and £9217 was paid in
wages by the Department of .Labor and
Industry. The cost of administration was less
than £56, nearly half of which was spent on
refreshments for the women employed.

A WOMAN'S
LETTER
No woman of 35 is going to wriggle
in under the heading of deb. and get
presented to the Duke in Sydney; the
organisers of balls are seeing to that.
The C.W.A. hasn’t given any age limit,
but it is clearly understood that it
expects only young things are to come
under the bud heading. The organisers
of the Welcome Ball to the officers of
the Sussex are out to capture dewy youth
for their Y.A.L. shivoo at the Wentworth
on November 26. Mrs. C. V. Baily is
the prime mover in this, and she suggests
that the girls carry fans instead of
flowers. Valerie Bavin is president of the
committee of younger folk; Dorothy
Youngman is the hon. sec. The Julius
lady will probably be the president of
the ball, and the Bavin lady’s name will
most likely head the list of vice-presi-
dents.
There was just the right mixture of sun
and breeze for the opening of the Royal
Sydney Yacht Squadron season on Satur-
day. Pennants fluttered gaily. Guests
arrived by car, by ferry. Jim Hardy
brought a group in his yacht. Commo-
dore Paul Ross and his wife were the
afternoon’s hosts. She wore printed
navy-and-white crepes under a fur coat.
The Governor and Lady Game watched
the proceedings from the verandah. The
naval C. N. Popes cheered with 400 or
500 others the Navy League cadets in
the cutter race. Literally, but kindly,
the tall Sir Nevile Wilkinson looked
down on everybody else. Emissaries
came from the Prince Edward Yacht
Club, the Royal Prince Alfred Yacht
Squadron and the Sydney Amateur Sail-
ing Club. There were masses of flowers
everywhere, but the tulips in the drawing-
room were outstandingly gorgeous.
There was tea in the billiard-room, and
in the private dining-room for the vice-
regals. There Mrs. Don Taylor’s orchids
got more than a passing glance. There,
too, the Bishop of the Riverina, Jordan,
C.J., and his wife, and Judge Backhouse
sipped their pekoe. Dr. and Mrs. Furbur
entertained aboard their own lugger.
Later there was dancing on the club’s
wide verandahs.
If there were more flower shows and
people had lime to attend them there’d
be less class war in the world. Visitors
walking up aisles of beauty find them-
selves discussing their gardens, their
trouble with snails, the too-clayey nature
of the soil, or the lack of sand with any-
one who happens to be near them. On
Wednesday at the Horticultural Show, in
two cases at least, names and addresses
were exchanged, and promises to visit
each other’s gardens were made.
Golden Dawn, an exquisite pale-yellow
rose, was acclaimed queen by the judges.
But the Frau Karl Druschki and Rose
Marie didn’t seem to mind ; neither did the
Etoile de Hollande that stood near by. The
Amethyst carnation nearly turned a rosy
red at all the attention she got. The hip-
peastrums raised their trumpets proudly,
as well they might, so gorgeous and
regal was their coloring. There was a
tulip called Bronze Queen ; tall spears
of delphinium and poppies were there.
Enid Hull exchanged fragrant beauties
for cash, to help fill the society’s
coffers. Lud Mayor Parker declared the
show open, and told how once seven
cabbage plants out of 12 he had bought
had died on him, and the others cost
him somewhere about 3s. ll|d. each to
raise. Housewives breathed a prayer of
thankfulness that civic life rather
than a market-gardening career had
claimed his Ludship.
“Cocktails in the Aquarium” ran the
invitation, gay with pink seaweed and
air bubbles, to a recent party of the
Rodney Dangars. The guests found
themselves in the newly-decorated dance-
room, the ceiling and walls a swirl of
greeny water. Tall green reeds and vivid
pink and red seaweeds, many of the giant
beanstalk family, running up and wav-
ing on the ceiling, gave a sense of move-
ment. On every side were Barrier Reef
friends: the spotted crabs, the yellow-
and-black marked Moorish Idol, the
green sailors with their black bars, the
vivid (almost Reckitt’s) blue demoiselle,
the jewel and the sky-blue starfish. Rose-
red and leaf-yellow, spotted and striped,
the fish swam among the anemones, the
coral beds and the shells, in their bril-
liancy of coloring eclipsing the dresses
of the guests who found themselves walk-
ing among these wonders of the deep.
The savories were exciting. There
were masted boats and bees, but mostly
they took the shape, the color and the
markings of the fish on the walls. The
light came from balls, like
so many bubbles. The hostess wore
orchids and lily-of-the-valley ; these and
her turquoise crepes became one with
the general color scheme. Among the
importants were Woodward Smith the
artist, and the hostess’s young niece,
Queenslander Phyllis Bell.
Here is Mimi Healy, another of Syd-
ney’s lucky young things, who goes
everywhere and enjoys life generally.
She is noted for her smart dressing.
Reading and dancing are her favorite
indoor pastimes, but when the weather’s
good tennis takes up a good deal of her
time. George Johnston made the
drawing.
They are to be met everywhere, women
in the white, blue or grey uniform of the
St. John Brigade. Saturdays and Sun-
days they give up to their voluntary
duties. They are to be found on the
beaches, on the playing fields and
wherever a crowd is collected. They
will be stationed along the route of the
procession when the Duke visits Sydney,
ready to render first aid. They get no
pay, provide their own uniforms and
pay their own fares to whatever job they
have been detailed. They bring their
own food, for no surf club or association
thinks of providing a meal for them.
Every man and woman of this army of
2000 work for a living. After 12 con-
secutive years of work, if found pro-
ficient and efficient in home nursing,
hygiene and first-aid generally, they get
the society’s medal. This year, for the
first time in its life, the society has been
recognised by the Government, and, as
part of the Health Week activities, Minis-
ter for Health Weaver inspected the
brigade and handed out certificates in
the grounds of Government House on
Saturday, much to the satisfaction of
enthusiasts Mrs. John Maund and Dis-
trict Commissioner Dr. R. G. Poate.
The most unusual thing the English
schoolgirls did while in Sydney was to
nurse the bears at Koala Park; the
brightest occasions were the dances at
Doone and Hopewood House. To Doone
came Commander Gifford and young
Philip Game, bringing Gwendolen Wil-
kinson with them. She’s tall, but Royce
Shannon made an admirable partner.
The halls and rooms were massed with
flowers, and the folding-doors between
hall, drawing-room and ballroom were
thrown open, so there was plenty of
dancing space. The girls made the sup-
per, and Miss Cheriton hostessed in blue
velvets that looked as if they had emerged
from a bath of silver moonlight. From
this party Beulah Bolton and Edith
Thompson went on to Hopewood House.
Here they found more fragrant blooms,
the dance-floor being well exercised, the
view greatly admired and Miss Nancy
Jobson ready to
welcome them in
graceful satins of
Persian-red.
Apostolic Dele-
ga t e Bernardini
rushed back from
greeting the
Prince in Mel-
bourne to open
the All-Australian
Fair. Mrs. Free-
hill and Miss
Kate Egan were
in the procession
from the door to
the platf o r m.
Boys in blue-
sashed white suits
sang songs of
welcome. The
hall was dressed
in Australian
flags from wall to
wall, and the
Papal colors, yel-
low and white,
had prominence.
Every State had
its stall, and so
had every large
town in N.S.W.
The fair con-
tinues till Satur-
day.
The Arts and
Crafters have
made a big haul
for their opening
to - day at the
Education Department’s Galleries. Lady
Game will murmur “Open Sesame.” Sir
Nevile Wilkinson will say a few words.
On the platform will be Lady Beatrix
and daughter Gwendolen. Old friends
of the society John Lane Mullins, Sydney
Ure Smith, Dorothea Mackellar and
Librarian Ifould will provide the back-
ground. As this Letter goes to press
members are busy hanging tapestries and
unpacking hand-beaten brasses, silver,
delicately-painted china, pottery of
charm, block-printed and batikked linens
and hand-wrought jewellery. The outer
room is being hung with modern colored
prints and full-size cartoons for stained-
glass windows. And through glass will
be glimpsed many sumptuous books and
samples of Wal Taylor’s exquisite bind-
ings.
Nancy White’s wedding to Humfry
Henchman was one of the few swaggei
affairs of the week. Over 100 guests
were asked to witness the exchange of
vows at St. Mark’s, Darling Point, and
afterwards to drink toasts at No. 11
Onslow-avenue. The wedding garment
of soft white satin had a very long train,
and over this an equally long tulle veil
billowed and spread. Bride’s sister
Prudence and Dorothy Radcliffe ’maided
in primrose muslins, with chaplets or
green laurel-leaves on their heads and
sheaves of mauve lilac in their hands.
The bride is the elder daughter of the
medical Wilfrid Whites, of Kogarah ; the
bridegroom is the son of Mr. Justice
Henchman, of Brisbane.
Up in the quiet of Anthony Horderns’
library women are playing for the chess
championship of N. S. Wales. Mrs.
Purdy and Mignon Frey (Mrs. Chey-
sens), last year’s runner-up, are among
those who are striving to take the
title away from Edna Kingston. The
other night when this Letter stuck its in-
quisitive head around the door it found
about 20 spectators, among them Dr.
Hertz and G. Hastings. All were inter-
ested in the girls’ play and in watching
Koshnitsky testing the games, eyes on
the records, fingers flying over the board
and, where necessary, lucidly explaining
points (there’s a minor championship
also waging) that might have been made.
Chess is attracting women more and
more. Of the 500 members in the Metro-
politan Club 100 are of the bobbed sex.
This is the largest group of women
players in the Southern Hemisphere, if
not in the world.
C. B. Westmacott, for many years
“the Firm’s g.m., died in St. Vincent’s on
Sunday after an illness that lasted some
weeks. His death will be mourned and
his kindliness remembered in theatrical
circles the world over. Like most people
associated with the stage, he liked the
simple things of life. He lived for some
years at Neutral Bay, and the inhabitants
of that suburb got used to seeing him
doing a bit of gardening or taking the
dogs for a walk. He and the “Herald’s”
Brunsdon Fletcher travelled on the same
ferry to town for years, and Westmacott
never broke his habit of looking for and
joining his old friend, who got aboard
at Kirribilli, no matter in whose com-
pany he had joined the boat.
Sheila, British Priminister Ramsay
MacDonald’s youngest daughter, and his
son Malcolm passed through Sydney
last week. They arrived by the Mel-
bourne express after seeing the Duke and
attending the Pioneer Ball, and left for
Brisbane by train the same night. Mal-
colm MacDonald is interested in the
sugar and meat industries, so he made
straight for Mackay and Rockhampton.
Sydney will see these visitors again on
their way back to Melbourne for the cen-
tenary festivities. They want to see
something of station life, and are look-
ing forward to seeing the Cup run. Be-
lieve it or not, the Kalgoorlie races the
brother and sister attended on their way
from Perth were the first this young
woman had ever seen. Miss MacDonald,
who is a B.A. of Oxford, is keenly inter-
ested in the science of education —not in
practical teaching.
Followers of the Vagabonds gave Ruby
Coxhead a big reception when she walked
on to the stage as Margaret in the “Love
Game,” for this was the first time she had
played since her illness last year. The
Clerical Workers’ fund was the benefici-
ary of the first night’s performance. Mrs.
Prentice, president of the N.Z.A., was
a front-seater on the second night. So
was Doris Clarke, leader of the associa-
tion’s young workers, into whose coffers
went the gate-money from this perform-
ance.

Melbourne
Chatter
People waited for hours in the streets
to catch a glimpse of the Duke, but their
feet could not have been more tired than
his arm, raised in a continuous series of
salutes. The Government of Victoria
grabbed the ancient Weeroona, put a
lick of paint here and there, squirted
eau-de-Cologne about to annul the per-
fume of ancient fish, produced a band
and morning-tea and packed the old
paddle-boat with specially-invited citizens
for a trip down the bay to meet the
Sussex. There was no lying in bed that
morning; the Weeroona chugged her
way out of Port Melbourne at 8.15.
When the illuminations were turned on,
the tramless people reflected the radiance
by a high degree of cheerful tolerance.
Traffic jambs lasted for hours, but nobody
seem«d to mind. Expensive 1934 stream-
lined cars struck up conversations with
ancient and wobbly Fords; drivers ex-
changed anecdotes or got out and paid
a series of calls on perfect strangers
locked up in the traffic. The pylons on
Prince’s Bridge looked very spectacular,
and the much-maligned Venetian poles
twinkled out “Take back what you said
about us.” The tower of Flinders-street
station became a startling ghost-green.
Spencer-street station tower wore a ruby
crown, the Post Office was outlined in
gold lights and the Town Hall was
washed with a glow of rose-pink. Nearly
every building had a flood-lit face or
colored decorations. A lion and a uni-
corn blazed on the Government offices
at the top of Collins-street; there was a
crown on Parliament House ; there was
a cross on St. Patrick’s Cathedral, and
the fountain in Spring-street played
alternate showers of rose and gold.
The Duke kept a date with over 17,000
school-children on the Melbourne Cricket
Ground on a day of marvellous sun-
shine. Owing to a week of storm and
fierce gales the children had had no con-
certed rehearsal, but everything went
without a hitch. Most spectacular were
the eighteenth-century boys and girls in
grey trousers and belltoppers and sway-
ing crinolines over little frilly pantalettes.
The little girls who skipped blithely
among the Bush Frolics wore pink, green
and gold stockings with fluffy thistledown
dresses, and bronze and gold autumn
leaves were whirled about by the storm
and finally scattered over the grass. The
Duke wore a brown lounge suit, and
strolled about in an unconventional
manner. On one occasion enthusiasts
broke through the arena, which caused
six hefty policemen to take to their
heels and sprint towards the offenders.
The enormous crowds expected in Mel-
bourne have not arrived. Though the
city is busy there are plenty of spare
beds. Asked a pound a day for ordinary
board and lodging, intending visitors
stayed at home. Tariffs are now down
to something more normal, and Mel-
bourne should be full for the Cup.
The Duke dined at the Town Hall with
the Royal Society of St. George, where
old English songs sung by the Lieder-
tafel figured on the menu instead of a
long list of speeches. Among guests
who plied knives and forks at the same
table as royalty were Lord and Lady
Huntingfield, the Archbishop and Mrs.
Head, the Poet Laureate and Mrs. Mase-
field, Gengoult Smith and his youthful
lady, Sir Maurice and Lady Hankey and
Sir John and Lady Cadman. At the
Duke’s suggestion everybody joined in
a chorus before he said good night and
went off to seek some rest in his ancient
four-poster at G.H.
Half an hour before the Caulfield Cup
was run a tall man in a brown pencil-
striped suit, brown hat and shoes walked
through the saddling paddock. Every-
body was studying the horses so intently
that it took some time for the royal visi-
tor’s identity to penetrate. When it did
a crowd followed him and watched the
introductions of trainers, jockeys and
horses. The gold cup glittered under a
glass protector near the stop-clock until
it was time for the Duke to present it
to J. T. Cush. The jockey, A. Knox,
brought for a royal word of congratula-
tion, did some nervous juggling with his
cap before producing his hand. The
Duke travelled in an oatmeal-colored
open car, and waved his hand all the way
along the track. The first race he wit-
nessed after his arrival was won by Gen-
goult Smith’s Princess Cynthia.
Dressing was guarded. The mild day
brought out some summer silks, but a
dull sky kept most materials in sombre
shades. Mrs. Albion Walkley’s tailored
dress had a row of buttons down the
front of the skirt. Mrs. Whitelaw’s
elegant gown was striped in narrow black-
and-white lines. Mrs. Fred Thiel’s chif-
fons were printed upon a black back-
ground, and Mrs. Charles Kirkby’s black
frock had air-vents upon the shoulders.
Mrs. Robert Lane’s dress, gloves and bag
were all good reasons for the popularity
of navy-blue with white pipings. Mar-
jorie Watson, of Bendigo, wore a flecked
rabbit-weave material, and Peggy Mol-
lard’s coat and hat were of blue taffetas.
Mrs. Ernest Marks and Mrs. Nichol Hart
were others who chose dark blue as a
predominating color scheme. Mrs. Andy
Manifold’s large white cartwheel hat was
a herald of summer.
For thousands the meaning of Mel-
bourne’s centenary is standing for hours
in the street, peering over one another’s
shoulders to catch a glimpse of the
Duke of Gloucester’s head and rais-
ing three hearty British cheers as
he goes past. Traffic jambs are
frequent, and most people are sorry
the trams are back on the streets,
taking up more than their fair share of
room. Every Melbourne paper has
brought out a centenary edition. An
ancient seller of news in Swanston-street
declares that he’s selling papers so
rapidly that he only gets five hours’ sleep
per night. “I get a fresh batch—there he
is on the cover, and they rush him like
hungry lions. I don’t know if I give
people the right change. The women
don’t care anyway as long as they get the
latest photo, of ’is ’lghness.”
Weird and wonderful were the vehicles
conveying passengers to and from
the city during the tram strike. Furni-
ture removal vans blossomed forth into
seats. A strange black conveyance with
pronounced wheel wobble and an undu-
lating upper deck (its normal use is the
transport of chickens) had “Toorak” in
chalk lettering. Another black vehicle —
it looked suspiciously like a hearse—ran
down to Port Melbourne. There were
plenty of taxis and ’buses, cheeky little
things with passengers balanced high
above the driver; large ancient derelicts
with rheumatics, lorries with temporary
sides of canvas and all sizes of trucks.
Fares were regulated, and were so cheap
for petrol transport that the drivers made
very small profit. Melbourne didn’t miss
the trams, and was appreciative of the
quietness of rubber tyres.
A Broothorp camera made this picture
of the Hon. Mrs. Helme Pott, whose
engagement-book since she came to Aus-
tralia last May has been well filled with
vice-regal functions, meetings and social
occasions. Her name is on the list of
committee workers for the Mooltan Ball.
She and her husband the Colonel and
their only child Hermione live at Gov-
ernment House, so at present they are
sheltered by the same roof as royalty.
Mrs. Helme Pott is Lord Huntingfield’s
sister.
Owing to Court mourning the gay para-
phernalia of uniforms was missing from
the United Services Ball. (Mess kit could
have been worn after midnight, but tails
only were seen even then.) The plates
used for supper wore (though probably
only by coincidence) black bands round
their rims. Among the guests were seven
officers from the Armando Diaz who
have not yet recovered from the shock
of being handed coffee with milk at a
dance in Perth. They have decided that
the safest drink in Australia is beer.
Owing to traffic congestion everybody
arrived late. “Uncle George,” as Lord
Milne is known among Army people in
England, with his lady and the Hon.
Joan, came along after dining with
royalty at G.H. Miss Milne’s three-*
quarter-length Chinese coat was made of
flowered and quilted silk. Brig.-General
Jess brought his wife in black lace with
dashes of Persian-blue. General and
Mrs. 0. F. Phillips, of Sydney, were
there, she in turquoise and amethyst
wrist manacles and a peppermint-stick
frock, upon which the stripes ran away
from each other or met' with a bang.
Lieut.-Commander lan MacDonald
brought his slim wife, wearing red and
black stripes which were not asked to
keep straight but undulated gently along
parallel pathways. Group-Captain Saul,
who brought out the flying-boats, sat at
the same supper-fable as Wing-Com-
mander and Mrs. Wrigley; Mrs. Frank
Lukis, in white-blistered crepe with twists
of apple-green; Captain Ernest Jones’s
wife, clad in sapphire velvet; and
Rees, frilly in spring-green. Captain Basil
Andrew’s wife wore gold with cutaway
shoulders; Mrs. A. J. Boase sported
plumbago-blue gracefully caped. Yvonne
Swift, in floral lame, kept her neck warm
with feathers; and Pat Newbigin’s
orchid gown had a waterfall of turquoise
chiffon.
Under the wide-brimmed spring hat is
Valerie Purves, who was one of the ticket
secs, of the Pioneer Ball, where she
danced in a gown which belonged to her
great-grandmother. The material was
thick, heavy silk striped in two shades
of grey, with an intricate frieze design
woven (though it looked like embroid-
ery) round the edges of the frills. Acces-
sories were a pink-and-blue bonnet and
a demure little parasol which was the
height of fashion 100 years ago. Both
Mrs. J. G. Purves and her only daughter
are experienced and very reliable com-
mittee workers. Ronald Esler made the
portrait.
Nobody swooned at the Pioneer Ball,
though folk in old-fashioned garb had
plenty of hairbreadth escapes getting
there. Owing to the dense crowds cars
and taxis had to be left several blocks
away, and ladies in crinolines and gentle-
men in mutton-chop whiskers squeezed
through a solid mass of humanity with
great difficulty. Detached hoops were
not so bad, but the young women who
hoped to arrive with their crinolines
already in position under their petticoats
had to hold them sideways over their
heads. Owing to Court mourning Lord
and Lady Huntingfield sent regrets, but
Lord and Lady Milne filled the gap and
received the Pioneer groups upon the
stage outside Governor La Trobe’s cot-
tage. A. A. Foster and Miss L. Foster
were dressed as La Trobe and his lady
holding a party at G.H. in Jolimont. A
prelude to the spectacular scene was a
minuet danced by Florrie Green’s boys
and girls.
The 40th Regiment, which arrived in
Victoria in 1852, led the Pioneers,
while soldiers in scarlet and marvellous
whiskers stood as a guard of honor.
Mrs. Ross Grant led the Henty group.
A very proud batch were the Kiddles
(there were so many large men in it
with magnificent beards and sideboards);
Margaret Kiddle was graceful in old-
world-blue taffetas. Among the McCraes
were several ladies with lace shawls and
very long black trains, and a member
of the sixth generation, small Bruce Le
Souef, in a kilt. Among the Grahams
was a bride in elaborately-quilted sleeves.
In one group was Mrs. Alan Currie,
elegant in orchid-pink, and in another
was Frank Clarke’s lady, her elaborately-
dressed hair threaded with blue velvet
ribbon. Among the a’Becketts (William
a’Beckett was Victoria’s first Chief Jus-
tice) were two sprightly Judges in ox-
blood robes. One was W. G. a’Beckett
and the other was a Weigall. Both be-
came so enthusiastic doing the polka that
they removed their wigs now and again
to cool off. Mrs. Gordon Chirnside,
being on the cigarettes-refreshment com-
mittee, dressed herself as a saucy bar-
maid, with a crisp black wig and a black
dress giddy with electric-blue stripes.
Miss Hammill, who owns several antique
dresses, wore something rich and black,
and Mrs. Horace Calder’s beautiful
brocades came in for a special word of
admiration.
For the first time for years Victoria
Golf Club was out of favor with the
weather for its annual guest day. People
who hit off early got home dry, but the
others were wet through and dry again
many times on their round. There was
a record entry of 213, and with the addi-
tion of extra arrivals during the after-
noon 234 sought refreshers in the dining-
room. Mrs. H. Lording and Mrs. E. K.
Lording won the foursomes trophies,
with Mrs. G. Hayes and Mrs. Leeming
close behind. Mrs. Cedric Broomhall
walked off with a beer-mug for putting,
and Mrs. Jenkins has an extra piece of
crystal for a straight eye in the croquet
putting. Acting-president Mrs. Wallie
Tompson didn’t play owing to a skirmish
with influenza, but was present in the
clubhouse. There were really wonderful
bowls of irises, English bluebells, lilac,
broom and the more plentiful golden
species and splendid tulips in the asso-
ciates’ rooms and in the lounge with the
spacious view over the links. This lounge
is men’s property except on special
women’s days. Noticed in the vicinity
of bridge tables and crackling log fires
were Mrs. Keith Ross, in a suit of
diminutive brown and white cnecks.
Benita Jardine, Mrs. Grant Hay and her
clad-in-cherry daughter Pat, Mrs. Leo
Doyle, in a blue jumper with a neat
round collar, and Hazel Conners and
Muriel Carr, who were both partial to
green woollies.
An impromptu party which went with
a bang was given by the Bert Andersons
last week. This couple decided at 6 p.m.
that Reg Roark, who has been trans-
ferred to Adelaide, was worthy of a send-
off, so they got busy on the telephone,
with the result that their home in Lin-
lithgow-road, Toorak, vibrated with
dancing feet until next morning. In
some miraculous manner the house was
suddenly filled with oysters and all
manner of food and drink and bowls of
gorgeous spring flowers. Mrs. Anderson
wore a chiffon frock of pinky floral
design. Most of the guests seemed to
have become acquainted in the days when
they wore short pants or schoolgirl
uniforms. A few of them were the
Rupert Carvers, the Alan Roarks, the
Pat Cahills, the Ac. Buxtons, the Bruce
Hoggs, Gueno Thomas and Jo Carew.
The Grenadier Guards Band had a
tumultuous welcome, crowds taking up
positions in the streets hours before its
arrival. As the men in their bearskins
marched up Collins-street a mass of
humanity surged behind them, com-
pletely submerging the four following
cars. The Town Hall was sparsely popu-
lated for the afternoon concert, but was
filled to saturation point in the evening.
Scarlet coats and gold trappings splashed
with color the stage otherwise occupied
by the overflow from other parts of the
house. Item numbers were posted in
large figures, so nobody in the audience
got lost among encores, some of which
were announced with a “By Desire”
placard. An unusual number was an
encore to a xylophone solo, a duet for
two players on the one instrument. In
the crowd were Lord and Lady Milne
and their daughter; Cr. Wales (Lord
Mayor-elect), with his wife, Winifred
and her fiance ; R. G. Menzies; Mrs.
Keith Klingender, with a rose-chiffon
cape flowing over a black gown ; Cecil
Tait, in black satin, with a strap or two
across the backbone, and Dr. and Mrs.
Roy Chambers, with their young daugh-
ter. Mrs. Gordon Hope was there ; also
the Morris Sallmanns, she with a fox
slung over her cherry coat; Dr. and Mrs.
Officer Brown, and Mrs. Charles
Osborne, who wore a quaint little gold
cap with a green-and-silver-striped coat^
Wing-Commander and Mrs. Eric Har-
rison gave a cheery sherry party at their
Brighton home on the late afternoon of
the Caulfield Cup. Pink and white fox-
gloves were bunched in the company of
lilies, stocks, carnations and roses behind
an artificial wall (the host’s carpentry) in
the lounge, and geraniums made a scar-
let streak above the fireplace in the ball-
room. The hostess wore a patterned
crepe frock, and Greta was all in navy-
blue. Among the guests were Group-
Captain Saul, knight John Longstaff,
Commander and Mrs. Leo Quick, John
Wallace, of Deniliquin, Wing-Com-
mander and Mrs. McNamara (she in
black lace), Squadron-Leader and Mrs.
Banting (she in a tucked blue coat over
a flowered garment), Squadron-Leader
Hempel and his beige-and-green-clad
wife, Dr. and Mrs. Sam Aitchison and
Mrs.’ Ted Dyson, whose intriguing brown
hat was flattened on one side of her
curls.

PAKETVAART HOUSE 255 GEORGE ST. SYDNEY
Ever since Sir Philip Game opened
Titania’s Palace there has been a con-
stant stream of visitors to see the resi-
dence of her Iridescence. To list the
treasures of the palace would fill this
Letter; to describe them would take
half the paper. There are tapestries,
ivories, china. The largest picture in
the Queen’s collection measures 6 by 2\
inches. In the Hall of the Guilds now
hangs our own Governor’s flag. Through
the door can be seen the pearl and pea-
cock throne. All the rooms are built
around a garden, and as you look into
them you can see the flowers and lawns
through the windows opposite. Titania’s
bed is done in yellow lacquer inlaid with
carved ivories. Embroidered on the
coverlet are the royal arms of Fairy-
land. The toilet service and the yellow
Sevres tea-service were the gifts of Queen
Mary, and her Majesty has also signed
the Fairy Queen’s visitors’ book. The
royal family is musical. The Queen has
a piano of her own. Her Consort, Prince
Oberon, has a ’cello. He is something
of a student, as his library of beautifully
bound books testifies. He is a sport, too,
for his golf-bag is standing ready to be
picked up. There’s a tiny enamel horse
(probably 3000 years old), found in a
mummy case; in a tomb near that of
Tut-ankh-Amen ; the ceiling of the chapel
has been adapted from the Book of
Kells; the lamps before the altar are of
old Dutch silver. But the oldest thing in
the palace is a slip of vitrified mastodon
bone under the seat of the throne.
Children will love the palace. They
will be amused and entranced with every-
thing, especially the Day Nursery, but
it will be to the grown-up who has never
lost his love for small things and his
imagination that the treasures of the
palace and its gardens (the latest addi-
tion to these is an ivory kangaroo, called
“Lin” after Lindsay Gordon) will most
appeal.
The Far West Children’s Health
Scheme is to have its group of young
workers. The musicale in the Mayoress’s
rooms was the prelude to its formation,
which is billed for 11 to-morrow morn-
ing at the Australia. The rooms were
massed with flowers, and a bouquet in
which the scent of lilac and red roses
blended was handed to the civic fast-
ness’s hostess by Mrs. S. Drummond.
Kitty Glover, Betty Ramsay, Nell Wil-
liams, Nancye McGilchrist, A. Cree and
Wilson Ewart threaded the afternoon
with music, and Mr. Drummond told of
the good work being carried on.
Devoted wives are following in the
foamy wake of their husbands’ warships.
The first cruiser to arrive was the Hin-
dustan, in which Captain Cooper s
brunette wife was interested. Mrs.
Cooper is a Frenchwoman, and has lately
spent several months in Bombay to be
near her husband. Even the burning
glare of Aden did not prevent her from
unpacking her suitcases in that desolate
place while the Hindustan was anchored
in the vicinity. Mrs. R. P. Mack was
ready to welcome her Lieut.-Commander
husband as the Sussex steamed into Port
Melbourne. She caught up with the
cruiser at several ports on her journey
from England.
Norman Lindsay’s heavyweights are
stamping over the walls of the Sedon
Galleries. The Peacock lady opened the
show. She read her speech, and by some
slip of the tongue commenced with “This
sexhibition.”
Betty Timmins and Dr. David Alsop
are to be married. Betty is the elder
daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Arthur Tim-
mins, of Toorak, and her fianed is the
younger son of Dr. and Mrs. Charles
Alsop, of Bairnsdale, Gippsland.
Miss A. Fisken and her attractive
young niece, Bettine Fisken, have not
waited for the centenary. They left last
week on the Ormonde for a holiday on
the other side of the world.
Our shops are expecting a new kind
of soap novelty for their Christmas sales.
Within tissue wrappings the cake is
shaped like a bunch of flowers, a fairy’s
castle, a butterfly, etc., and its correct
position on bath or basin is to rest upon
its three or four “legs.” The idea is to
prevent slipping and slithering while
steam and water gurgle round its ankles.
And it dries quickly.
From London comes this story about
the new type of rubber “foundation gar-
ment.” A girl running to flesh decided
that if she left one on it would act as a
reducer and she’d emerge slim as a
nymph with a flat film-star diaphragm.
She even wore the thing in her
bath. At the end of five weeks she
got tired of being trussed up, and with
great difficulty peeled off the garment—to
find that her skin had grown through
the hundreds of small perforations used
as ventilators, and she looked uncom-
monly like a crumpet.
THE LITTLE SISTERS.
WESTRALIA.
Jean Wingrove and Bill Hyde launched
their matrimonial craft at the little chapel
of St. George’s Cathedral with the great-
est secrecy. Only at the aftermath at the
Palace did one see her blue-flecked white
marocain with its frilled hem, and the
dainty lace hat wreathed with blue velvet
and lilies-of-the-valley. Bride’s sister,
Mrs. Duke Bird, set about with navy
floral crepes and white French kilting,
held Jean’s delphiniums and white carna-
tions during the ring exchange.
The Tattersall’s Club at-home was one
of the few functions of the week, as
most of the social folk were recuperat-
ing from the Ducal festivities. President
Lalor and his better-half (she nestling
cream roses ’gainst burgundy Chantilly)
bowed welcomes and ushered guests to
the reception-room, where fruit-laden
boughs of loquat-trees marched with
roses, stocks and Geraldton wax. Music
was made by Lorna Sydney-Smith,
Eileen Hart, Billy Edwards, Roy Glenis-
ter, David Lyle and W. Hadley, and
afterwards there was dancing on the
verandahs.
A fall of silver leaves alighted on
Jocelyn Lejcune’s shimmering pink taf-
fetas at the dance held in her honor by
Pat Hadfield at the latter’s South Perth
home. Pat greeted the guests in Nile-
green matelasse, and Mrs. Hadfield saw
to the doings in a graceful combination
of black satin and lace. Helen Dobson,
the Collister twins, Felicity Sands, Joan
Saiom and Patience Warburton were a
few of the young fry who joined in the
revels.
Nell Manford warmed red-and-black
floral chiffons with a scarlet coatee at the
dinner party at the Esplanade, where her
engagement to Robin Montague Black,
of Atley station, Sandstone, was
announced. A brace of engagements
with other men from the wide-open
spaces as ring-givers concerns Cottesloe’s
Josephine Temperley and Ted Hayes, of
Northam, and Brigadier-General Bessel-
Browne’s second daughter Joan and
John Sewell, of Bencubbin.
National station 6WF put on a cheery
hop in its outer studio, with Nelson
Burton’s baton conducting the Western
Studio Orchestra. Miss Gorst, slim and
trim in honey beige laces, saw to things,
and Mrs. Charlie Wicks stood at her
right hand in misty-blue chiffons. Florrie
Cameron wafted a length of snowy satin,
Mrs. Percy Cannot gyrated in curd-white
delf striped crepe and Mrs. Henry Schon-
nell danced in pastel-pink ninon.
The grand exodus from Perth to the
Eastern States for the centenary celebra-
tions goes on apace. Mrs. Hubert
Momber said “Au revoir” to a host of
friends at a cheery dance at her home in
Cottesloe. Roses adorned the lounge to
the edge of an alcove where the bar was
set, and Chinese lanterns marked the pas-
sage through the garden to the dance-
room, where the hostess extended a wel-
coming hand from be-bustled cherry-red
velvet.
Linely Wilson had to cancel a number
of farewell parties arranged in her
honor, as the Remo sailed prior to
schedule. A long sojourn in Italy and
from thence to London is her objective.
SOUTH AUSTRALIA.
Adelaide looks like a shorn lamb now
all the flags and colored lights have gone,
but the population is fast getting back
to normal.
The president (Douglas Mawson’s
lady) and committee of the Lyceum
Club entertained Lady Hankey and
Miss -Sheila MacDonald, who passed
through Adelaide on their way to Mel-
bourne for the centenary. Miss Mac-
Donald said her father envied her
making the trip to Australia.
The weather has been very kind to
the roses, and the Rose Show in the
Town Hall was a huge success. The
idea of decorating the hall itself with
the lovely blooms added greatly to
the attraction. The decorative work this
year was undertaken by Mrs. F. W.
Porter, Mrs. R. K. Wood and Mrs. S.
McGregor Reid. Lady Dugan performed
the opening ceremony, the hall being
crowded. The weather was sultry, and
the perfume of the roses in such pro-
fusion was almost overpowering. The

TASMANIA.
The Maoriland Fleet’s week in Hobart
was the excuse for much junketing,
although the dance arranged at Govern-
ment House had to be cancelled in view
of happenings in Europe. A dinner party
at G.H. was given to the senior officers.
A committee of young folk ran a gay
dance at the Continental during Fleet
Week, with Janet McPhee as hon. treas.
Though ’flu was raging, about 300 rolled
up.
His Ex. went up to Launceston to be
present at the Batman centenary official
dinner. The show was held in the dining-
room in the old Cornwall Hotel,
Cameron-street, where the first plans for
the settlement of Port Phillip were made
exactly a hundred years ago. Table
decorations included a floral model of
# the old schooner Rebecca. After dinner
*the Governor unveiled a tablet with por-
traits of Batman and Fawkner. On the
Sunday a church service was held at St.
John’s, the old church whose history
marches with these developments.
His Ex. and Lady Clark attended the
R.A.C. show at the Masonic Hall. Presi-
dent Weller Arnold had his daughter be-
side him to receive guests. Red baize
and pot-plants in the hall looked as
though the Duke himself were expected,
and the decorations generally were
ornate. Lady Clark sported her favorite
shade of blue, and Miss Arnold was in
a long frock of windswept satin, with
hand-made flowers outlining the low-
back.
The Matrons’ Ball at the Continental
in Fleet Week disappointed its promoters,
since Court mourning kept Sir Ernest and
Lady Clark away. The debs., Helen
Bethune, M. Ashton-Jones and Barbara
Mace, had nobody to bob to. However,
except that the mourning edict banned
the wearing of uniforms by officers, the
dance was a smart affair. Mrs. Arndell
Lewis as hon. sec. worked hard, and her
ice-blue-and-silver trained gown was
everywhere. Massed rhododendrons and
super-pansies figured in the decorations.
The W.E.A. Drama Festival, with
the N. P. Booths as judges, came to its
end at the Town Hall with four plays,
Mrs. Brough and Mrs. Brett tying for
highest votes. Many of the plays given
were original, and showed us what a
terribly difficult job it is to write a one-
acter.
Helen Gray and Geoff Clerk, of
Hobart, announce their engagement.
The loss of 12 lives through some un-
explained mishap to our air-liner Miss
Hobart has come as a great shock to
the Speck, which hoped for great things
from this swift service. At time of writ-
ing hope still lingers that the ’plane may
have made a safe landing somewhere, but
the very thorough search made by air-
craft has discovered only an ominous
patch of oil 10 miles from the mainland
coast.
“Macaulay’s Schoolboy”: The state-
ment of “The Lyre” in the article “What
to Say about Music” (B. 3 /10 / ’34) that
Liszt “really did take holy orders to
escape a princess who wanted to marry
him” ought to be killed straightway.
Up to the day of his death Liszt was as
free as any other bachelor to marry.
He was never a priest. He never took
any vow of celibacy. Liszt received the
four minor orders from Cardinal Hohen-
lohe at the Vatican in 1865. These were
Doorkeeper, Lector, Exorcist and Aco-
lyte. This made him a cleric, and entitled
him to be called Abbe, but they were no
bar to marriage.
“S.T.S.”: The Bulletin had a theory
in it's early days that nobody could live
to be over 100, and that people who
claimed to be centenarians were exag-
gerating, either consciously or not. Many
cases have been clearly established since
then ; but the innocent-exaggeration risk
is illustrated in a current Adelaide case.
While the lady was being congratulated
on reaching 103, Pitt, of the Archives,
and A. T. Saunders, the old-time autho-
rity, dug into records which showed that
she’was only 18 on her arrival in 1855.

The Inter-State Match.
The recent severe defeat of the N.S.W.
players in Melbourne may be a very
wholesome bitter.
No excuses can be offered about lack
of teamwork and unfamiliarity with
play under aggregate point-scoring con-
ditions. It is possible that we relied too
much on the calibre of our individual
players, but, apart from the excellence
of the Victorians as a team, at least two
of them, Messrs. Champion and Moss,
are superior as match-players to anyone
yet seen in Sydney. The excessive length
of the programme wearied us no more
than our opponents, but they kept
their form right up to the last session,
when they threw a few points away. It
may be that none of our men played up
to his best Sydney form —in fact, at
times, the display was lamentable —but
even had we been all at our top it
would not have affected the result.
The excellence of Mr. Champion’s
team lay in the fact that their percentage
of error is much smaller than ours. Each
partner has confidence in the other ; with
the slightest encouragement they are
hardly ever guilty of underbidding ; alter-
natively, even if Mr. Nathan held a very
strong hand, discouraging responses from
Mr. Moss would cause him to stop short
of a game which was not there. It was
the same with the partnership of Mr.
Champion and Mr. Goldberg. The N. S.
Wales pairs seemed to lack this trust in
one another.
In the actual play of the cards the Vic
torians showed us points. It was not so
much that they were brilliant in diffi-
cult situations as that they showed them-
selves masters of safety play. At the
opening lead in every hand, the declarer
would review the position and arrange
his plans to guard against any possible
bad breaks from distribution. On our
part I am afraid that we were too in-
clined to play a number of contracts
“by ear.”
N.S.W. association should lose no time
in arranging a “Teams of Four” com-
petition similar to that which is an
annual event in Melbourne. This holds
the interest of players over a period of
months, and the rivalry is so keen that
improvement in the standard must result.
The material is here, and there is a suffi-
cient number of suburban clubs to chal-
lenge the pretensions of any fours from
the Sydney Bridge Club. I should like
to add a word about the courtesy and
kindness of the Victorian officials and
players. Mr. M. M. Phillips and Mr.
F. D. Smith were only too willing to
meet us in smoothing out minor differ-
ences in the match arrangements, and
Mr. Champion spared no pains in mak-
ing us comfortable at the table.
In Messrs. Champion and Moss Vic-
toria has the two best players I have yet
seen in action. They nearly always finish
in the correct contract, and if there is
any chance of playing it home they will
do so. On the form displayed against
us, I would rank Moss as very little
behind Champion. Of the others, Nathan
indulged in an occasional “punt,” but
on the whole his game was very solid.
I was much impressed with the form
of Oddie, who substituted for Goldberg
in two sessions.
The deal given below illustrates some
very fine bidding and the luck of the
opening lead.
West dealer, neither vulnerable.
This freakish array led to the bidding
of every suit up to the five level, and
resulted in my partner, Mr. Flohm, being
doubled at five spades. The contract was
only defeated by Nathan shrewdly
assuming that his partner, Moss, was
void in diamonds and opening from his
doubleton. The defence thus made two
spades and the club ace. In Room Two,
N. S. Wales, sitting East-West, again
secured the contract, Cadwallader being
doubled at six hearts. His partner Grif-
fiths had bid clubs and supported hearts,
while Champion and Goldberg had bid
up to five diamonds and five spades.
After some consideration Champion
(North) elected to open with the diamond
king. This makes the six contract secure,
for the losing spade is discarded on the
long clubs. A spade opening, of course,
defeats the small slam venture imme-
diately, but as his partner had called
both suits it was not easy for the leader
to pick the better opening.
+
Codes and Systems.
Some contract players seem to find a
childish glee in bidding, with absolutely
no object, the suit they don’t possess.
I have seen one of these bridge confi-
dence men call one club and, when part-
ner signified his purchase of the gold
brick by supporting clubs, loudly bid
four spades. The fact that if they per-
sist in misnaming the suits they hold all
partnership confidence must ultimately
be lost never seems to occur to them.
On occasion, first-class players resort to
the practice of bidding their short minor
suit when holding a hand with possi-
bility of game in no-trumps. The idea
is mostly twofold ; the caller wishes to
know if his partner can support that
minor suit; if not, should the contract
finish in no-trumps, he hopes to prevent
an early lead of it. Bluff bids of this
type are generally worked on system or
code with partner to the extent that he
is never expected to respond to a minor-
suit bid with one no-trump. If he cannot
call another suit, he shows any sort of
a fit he holds in his partner’s bid by
raising it to two. When the original
bidder is thus assured that his short
minor suit is unlikely to be run against
him, he bids the full number of tricks
which his holding warrants. There is
some method in this calling, if it is not
overdone, but the smart bluffer who
decries all systems finishes up by deceiv-
ing no one but his partner.

"They don't get
storms now! "
The drawings by ARIA
WHENEVER I hear present-day
seamen talking about storms they
have encountered, I laugh. They
don’t get the storms now that we got
.when I was an A.B. in the good old
days before steam. No, sir! At the most
they get a bit of a blow —a mere capful
of wind.
And there are no real sailors these
days either. They went out with the
’jammers. Real seamen they were then.
I was one of them.
Nowadays an A.B. is only a profes-
sional brass-polisher. The only difference
between him and a handyman in a
luxury hotel is that the floor sometimes
has a slight slant under the feet of the
A.B. He is given to sleeping between
sheets (how that makes a real shellback
smile!), has scrambled eggs on toast for
breakfast, and uses rubber gloves with
which to perform any work that might
spoil his manicured nails. If you were
to ask him what a yardarm was he’d
think you referred to a boxer with a
reach of three feet. Shrouds, to him,
merely conjure up visions of an under-
taker’s accessory.
DID I ever tell you about one trip I
had around Cape Horn? I had
joined the Deathrattle at Montevideo.
She was a long, narrow, rakish, squat
"... .joined the Deathrattle.”
little seven-and-a-half-masted barque,
nuggety in the beam, with three decks,
a bottom and no top. A hand-carved
bowsprit reached three-quarters of the
way into the wind, from which a jib
boom protruded even further. She was
of an immense draught; in fact, in my
first night at sea aboard her I woke up
in the early hours shivering, due to my
blanket being whisked out through the
forecastle door.
After that I lashed myself to the bunk.
The draughtiness had its advantage
though ; and I acquired some - socks and
underpants which were blown out of the
captain’s cabin (when he inadvertently
left the door open) one day as I passed.
At least, they were on the floor just
inside the door, and must inevitably have
been blown out had I not picked them
up.
I signed on as an A.B- —anyway,
that’s what the captain called me; the
mate had a nasty way of dropping his
a’s. He was a real nasty fellow. He
seemed to single me out as a special
victim of his spleen, which was excessive.
This was made abundantly clear the
second night out. Just as I was warming
my bed with a hot-water bottle prior to
retiring for the night, he roared out in
an uncouth voice:
“You’re to take the dogwatch, Bohn-
dohm.”
Not even a “please” from the fellow!
Resentment must have been evident in
my voice as I said:
“But I thought you only kept a cat
on board.”
He swore for fifteen minutes without
repeating one word.
lIJE had left Montevideo, the sun on
™ the larboard tack and wind and
water on our port
beam, with a load of
tombstones, outward
bound for Fu Chow
via ports. We had to
go around Cape Horn,
which evidently was a
considerably less dis-
tance than by going
the alternative route
(which I personally
would have chosen as
being the more pic-
turesque) up past
Canada and Green-
land, across the Arctic
Ocean and down past
Alaska into the Pacific
Ocean. Evidently the
captain thought that
the war which was
raging in China at the
“A real nasty fellow.”
time might be over if we took too much
time on the voyage, with a consequent
serious loss of profits.
The owners, shrewdly contending that
if the war kept on long enough some of
the antagonists might even be killed, had
gambled on unloading the tombstones to
interested relatives at a handsome profit.
The captain, Mcßagpipe, a canny Czech,
who had had considerable experience in
the Czecho-Slovakian Navy, had also
taken on, as ballast, a few thousand
cubic feet of kapok. This he hoped, on
his own account, to sell to the war-lords ;
there would have been just about enough
to have made sufficient beds for the
5000 general in the contending armies.
I thought we’d have trouble with that
cargo, and I voiced my opinion to the
captain, who was a real martinet—one
of the old school. I said to him one
day as I was burnishing up the binnacle
with whale oil and banana skins:
“Look here, Alf,” I said, “the first
real blow we get going around the Horn
will shift those tombstones in the hold,
and they’ll go straight through the sides
of the ship. Why not
pad the sides of the
old tub with the kapok
and put some between
each of these marble
epitaph-carriers that
are, Deo volente,
destined to grace some
Oriental bone orchard.
If you’d had the
brains of a consump-
tive louse you’d have
thought of it yourself
when they were being
stacked.”
The skipper turned
a quid, or at the very
least two shillings’
worth, of plug to-
bacco over in his
mouth (he considered
it effeminate to chew
“flaked”), and with a beautiful shot
landed one right on the back of the
helmsman’s neck, exactly midway be-
tween his ears. As he turned to face me
I had a rather uneasy feeling, as I might
have stopped one in the eye, but the suc-
cess of his aim had apparently put him
in a good humor, for he went on chew-
ing.
“I had thought of it, ape,” he said,
more in a deep sorrow than in anger,
but still with that charming old-world
courtesy that was innate in the man,
“but it would muck up the kapok it
would get all squashed out of shape. No
Chinese general would think of going
into action with a kapok bed that was
lumpy. I’d lose me connection.”
That captain was a most obstinate
man. Time and again I would offer real
brainy suggestions, but he just muddled
along in his own way.
I't was an awful winter off the Cape
that year. It had been ominously
calm as we came down the east coast of
Patagonia. I distinctly remember that
it was the east coast, as Patagonia hasn’t
a west coast.
“The skipper turned a quid.”
Immediately we came around the
corner of the Horn a seventy-mile blow
hit the ship. It was quite dark when it
happened (as the Cape wasn’t visible to
the naked eye, it probably wouldn’t have
occurred in the daylight, as the skipper
would have seen it approaching). He
apparently wanted to make the most of
the trade winds that blow at that time
of the year, and he had every inch of
canvas aloft at the time. I was playing
crib with the captain and the cook as
the fore-topgallant s’l became a bunch of
ribbons.
fifteen two, fifteen four and a
pair’s six,” said the captain as he jumped
up and swept all the money on the table
into his pocket. “All hands on deck to
goose-wing the mains’l. Wear ship!”
and he dashed up above.
An awful sight met our gaze as we
rushed on deck, clad in our fur-lined

oilskins and sea-boots and tight-fitting
berets. The wind had blown the riding
light out and the boatswain was trying
to light a match over the binnacle to
get the longitude. He was on his fourth
box. The third mast from the front
had veered over at an alarming angle,
and the carpenter was busy nailing it to
the deck with clouts,
while one of the sea-
men was lashing it to
the wheel-house. A
huge sea had staved in
the galley door and
probably diluted the
devilled kidneys which
the cook had prepared
for the next morning’s
breakfast. The ship
was almost over on its
side, and occasionally a
big wave would break
over the mastheads.
I mentioned to the
captain that, with the
starboard side of the
ship almost out of the
water, it would be a
good opportunity to get
the crew, as soon as it
broke daylight, on to
the job of ridding the
ship of the barnacles
which would be exposed. Moreover, the
weight of the entire crew being on one
side might help to right the ship.
“And what about those tombstones,
Alf?” I said. “Hear that noise in the
holds? I told you so.”
UOR the first time since I had joined
' the ship (and it looked as if they’d now
want something to join it with) the cap-
tain very nearly lost his temper.
“You stupid blankard!” he bellowed
above the roar of the typhoon. “If I
thought it was possible to brain you I’d
let you have this belaying pin. What
are you fooling around with them lee
braces for?”
“They’re not lee braces,” I said;
“they’re police and firemen’s.”
He threw a sugar-doodle just as a tre-
mendous wave made the Deathrattle
shudder from stem to stern. With a
sickening lurch she heeled over, the wave
catching her between the port quarter
and the scuppers. The
next thing we knew
was that she was once
more on an even keel.
The mate sprang up
and commenced giv-
ing orders fiercely:
“All hands aloft to
shorten sail haul
away! Square the
mizzen yards! Catch
a turn with the anchor
chain there, Bohn-
dohm!”
He had singled me
out, of course, for the
most dangerous job of
all. I had to take the
weight of the anchor
and twist the chain
“I caught them.”
around the capstan in readiness for any
emergency.
However, I was equal to the task, and
after I had finished he said: “See if you
can bring the captain to by pouring cold
water down his neck.”
In a few seconds I had wrung his oil-
skin out over his face, and he sat up.
“What are you doing with your hands
in my pockets? Up aloft and help
shorten sail, you scangy swine!”
Overcome by this base ingratitude of
one who almost owed his life to my skill
in regaining him his consciousness, I stag-
gered to the forecastle to get my scissors.
I always believed in doing a neat job of
anything. As I reached the door I could
see a huge sea rushing out of the mist
straight for the ship. It hissed and roared,
a tremendous wall of foaming green.
Now, anything foaming usually makes
my mouth water, but this didn’t. I just
had time to yell out a warning to the
captain—vindictiveness has no place in
my make-up, and, anyway, he still owed
me a few bob for the crib.
“What is . . . ouch! ”
The last word was wrung from him as
the wave washed him against the bul-
warks. A cross wave took the ship—
and the skipper—under the stern, and in
an instant he was hanging between wind
"....a tremendous wave.”
and water, maintaining his precarious
position with one hand grasping a dead-
eye and the other the crow’s-nest.
As one wha has ever prided himself
on a delicacy of feeling, I couldn’t bring
myself to stand there laughing immoder-
ately at the captain’s predicament. I
tottered down the forecastle companion,
drop-kicked the ship’s
cat on to the top
bunk and fell, writhing
with the pangs of inex-
tinguishable laughter,
on to my sea chest.
I heard later that they
just pulled him inboard
in time. It’s just as well
I hadn’t stopped up on
deck or I’d probably
have gone into hysterics.
THE storm continued
* to rage, and kept up
its fury for the best
part of two months.
The position of the
crew was getting des-
perate. We were re-
duced to eating any-
thing made of leather
and drinking bilge-
water.
One day a school of mutton-birds
wheeled screaming over the ship and I
caught them. It was a simple matter. I
just got into the crow’s-nest, put some
salted mutton on a hook and attached
it to a long piece of string, and let it
wave in the gale. Within ten minutes I
had them all. The captain promised me
a special bonus for saving their lives,
but after his first mouthful he changed
it to a fine. He was glad to get back
to a leather diet.
Eating nothing but leather and drink-
ing bilgewater would undermine the
strongest constitution, and we were get-
ting weak. Day after day the captain
would come on deck, set his sextant and
go through the process of. “shooting”
the sun, though we hadn’t seen it for
seven weeks. Force of habit, I suppose.
The sun wasn’t the only thing that was
shot, either, and the skipper never found
out how the crew managed to “lift” the
five-gallon keg of rum.
Just as the position was getting really
desperate and the captain was even con-
sidering pulling up the anchor and going
back with the wind behind him, the
gale abated and we were becalmed.
tied up to the Cape and took in
” more provisions, but it wasn’t until
late the next year that we eventually got
to our destination. The captain was mor-
tified to discover that there were no wars
on in China at the time, though there
had been three other wars completed
since we had commenced the voyage.
Peace seemed to have broken out at
last, and it might have been months be-
fore the next war started.
As there was no money to pay us with
he used the cargo and ballast. My share
was seventeen tombstones and a ton of
kapok. As the type of tombstone we
had brought wasn’t used in China, and
as they sleep on mats, I couldn’t spend
my wages. That was thirty-six years ago,
and I still have my wages. I’ve been
waiting on some sailing-ship ever since
that will use them as ballast, but I’ve
been out of luck.
I’m sufficient of a philosopher, how-
ever, to ponder on the comforting fact
that at least the purchase of a tombstone
will not be a necessity when I wriggle
out.

A Joyous , Breezy Light Comedy: —
M. PLATAPAN'S ROOF
BY P.A DARBYSHIRE.
‘‘A hundred thou-
sand francs a week,
but nothing for
poor Platapan whose
roof lea k s !.... /
see!”
70U have collected the rent of M.
V Boulanger, of the first floor?"
asked Mme. Platapan.
Platapan shuffled uneasily, but did not
reply.
“He is a little short this week, n'est-ce
pas?” she commented acidly. “As he
was last week and the one before and
the many before that again.”
“His pictures are slow of sale,” Plata-
pan faltered, avoiding her eyes. “Besides,
Mathilde, you know the boy has not
been well.”
“And Mile. Carnot, of the third floor?”
she went on. “No doubt she, too, is
financially embarrassed.”
“Unfortunately, yes,” he confessed;
“but she expects money any day from
a rich uncle.”
“From Fiji, I suppose,” she sniffed.
“You are an idiot, Ludevic. You take
all these flimsy excuses, and the tenants
laugh at you, and do not pay and do
not pay—and will never pay.”
“They have been unfortunate,” he
mumbled.
“Oh, undoubtedly,” she scoffed. “But
in the meantime, while they are recover-
ing their fortunes, there is the roof.”
“Ah, yes,” he sighed ; “there is the
roof.”
THERE was, indeed, the roof.
It leaked sadly. In the attic rooms
long, mournful runners of rain trickled
down the walls so that one might easily
imagine oneself in an aquarium.
The walls were rapidly becoming cov-
ered with mildew, and it was nothing
short of a miracle that the usually vigi-
lant health inspector had not seen and
condemned the entire top floor.
“I must do something about it,” he
said dolefully. “I must.”
“You have told me that for years,”
she said sharply. “Always I listen to
your empty promises, of which nothing
ever comes —nothing!” She sniffed.
“Nothing!” She sobbed.
He stared at her in consternation.
She had tried scolding often enough
about the wretched roof, but never tears
—and, to make it worse, they were
genuine.
“Do not weep about it, Mathilde,” he
begged her.
“Do not weep!” she echoed, the tears
running fast. “When I think of what the
last twenty years have brought me I
could go mad. When we married you
had just inherited this house, and it was
a smart place then with a good roof. At
the same time my sister Gervaise mar-
ried Lombard, a mere plumber. I used
to feel sorry for them, they were so poor,
but now the shoe is on the other foot.”
She spread out her hands in a wild
gesture. “They have done well, despite
their large family of five, while we have
but one. Four years ago Lombard
bought her a Citroen ; last year he got
her a Renault, and this year there is talk
of a Minerva. A Minerva! But what
have we? An old house with a leaky
roof!”
“We have been unfortunate,” he pro-
tested.
“And why?” she demanded. “Because
you have been too soft with the tenants
—and only because of that.”
“They would pay if they could.”
“Pay? Pouf! They will never pay.
Godard, the famous tenor, who once
boarded with us —did he ever pay the
thousand francs he owes? Flambin, the
great film starB—where 8 —where is his eight hun-
dred francs?”
“How could one approach such
people?” he asked plaintively.
“I do not know, but approach them
you shall,” she snapped. “Tell them you
must have the money, that you need ten
thousand francs for anew roof, not to
mention another ten for painting and
repairs and a hundred other things.”
“I could not do it,” he faltered.
“You must. Think of Isabelle, our
daughter, without a sou for her dot. It
is a marvel that young Bonnet, her
fiance, takes it so well. Isabelle says
I nothing to you, but to me she weeps out
her heart that she goes to
him penniless.”
“She does not,” he said
indignantly.
“You know it,” she said
hotly, and he was silent.
“You must do it,” she went
on. “You must beard these
people. Come, let us draw
up a list of the possibles. Besides
Godard and Flambin, there are Hector,
the sculptor, and Odeon, the artist, and
then there are” Her pen flew
quickly over the paper.
NEXT morning M. Platapan set out on
his hated task, and never did a man
do so more reluctantly, for he was a
pleasant little fellow who would rather
forgive a debt than ask for it. It was
only the thought of the parlous state of
the roof and of his daughter’s grief that
spurred him on.
He cooled his heels in the lobby of
Godard’s luxurious apartments while
the great man breakfasted, and when at
last he was received his teeth were chat-
tering with cold and excitement.
“M. Platapan! ” cried Godard, shak-
ing his hand cordially. “How pleasant
it is once again to see your smiling face.
My idiot of a butler gave me your name
wrongly, or you should not have waited.”
Platapan mumbled a pleasantry. Such
a reception was disarming ; it would be
very difficult to reveal his errand.
“And Madame? She is well? And
the little Isabelle—no doubt a young
woman now?”
“She is affianced to young Georges
Bonnet, the publicity man,” said Plata-
pan with pride. “Probably you remem-
ber him?”
“Of course, the rascal! What happy
times we shared, just five years ago!”
Godard sighed, as if evea a sudden trans-
lation to fame and wealth had its draw-
backs. “He was a wit, young Georges;
oh, a sad thing . . . But tell me, you
have heard me sing recently?”
“No,” said Platapan, realising unhap-
pily that to anybody but a half-wit like
himself it would be a golden opportunity
of saying that he could not afford it, and
then getting to business.
“Then you shall. I shall instruct my
secretary to send you two tickets for my
next concert —practically booked out, by
the way. No, better still, I shall do it
now.”
He rang a bell imperiously, a young
man entered, and in a few minutes poor
Platapan was in the street, clutching in
his moist hand a slip of pasteboard. It
was a bad beginning.
FLAMBIN, the film star, also gave him
a warm welcome and pressed him
to accept a fat cigar, together with a
liberal nip of excellent cognac and tickets
for a preview of his latest picture.
Odeon, the artist, was not at home.
Hector, the sculptor, had a most im-
portant sitter, his concierge said, and
Platapan went wearily homeward.
His dejected air told Madame the
whole story, and she was so angry that
the pass for Godard’s recital and the
promise of an invitation to the preview
of Flambin’s picture only served to en-
rage her further.
“I have had enough,” she cried. “To-
night we shall take council with Isabelle
and Georges. He is a young man of
ideas and is bound to think of some-
thing.”
GEORGES evolved an idea almost at
once.
“I have it, my dear M. Platapan,” he
said excitedly. “It has come to me like
a flash. It is a veritable brainwave.”
He went into an eager explanation,
and Platapan caught his excitement.
“It seems feasible,” he said, “and if
it is successful”
“Yes?” expectantly.
“Then all you get over the necessary
expenses of the roof and the repairs shall
be Isabelle’s for her dot.”
NEXT morning Georges was very busy
carrying out his plan. Firstly, he
approached Godard, the tenor, and put
it to him.
“H’m,” said Godard, stroking his
chin thoughtfully. “You think it will
“Success? All Paris will be there",
you shall see. Think of the publicity! *

Tract

is the most prolific
source of disease''
states famous German doctor, Professor L. Schmiedler
SELF-POISONING-the basic cause of
most ill-health
Many specialists unite in Warning
Self-poisoning, or Autoxima, for
much of present - day ill - health.
Modern foods and the stress of
modern life combine to produce a
sluggish condition of the intes-
tines. Particles of food-waste, not
properly evacuated, become en-
crusted on the intestinal walls,
much as a water-pipe becomes
coated with rust. This waste de-
cays, harbouring disease-breeding
'germs and poisons which are ab-
sorbed into the system. Thus your
blood-stream is polluted, your
health undermined. Self-poisoning,
from which nine out of ten suffer,
is responsible for all manner of
aches, pains and sicknesses.
TRY THIS SIMPLE WAY TO
HEALTH
Fortunately, modem medicine has
at its disposal a preparation with
extraordinary health-bringing pro-
perties COLOSEPTIC. It is a
natural, simple way to flush the
poisons of autoxima right out of
the system. COLOSEPTIC
promptly combats chronic consti-
pation. It invigorates the intestinal
muscles —it stimulates the flow of
gastric juices and improves the ap-
petite COLOSEPTIC completely
loosens off the waste matter and
passes it smoothly out of the body—
thus removing the basic cause of Self-
poisoning. It rids the blood of all
impurities through Nature’s other
outlets—the kidneys, the pores of
the skin and the respiratory organs.
DRINK COLOSEPTIC EVERY
MORNING
Are you suffering from constipa-
tion, weakness, indigestion, gas in
the stomach and bowels, catarrh,
backache, rheumatism, neuritis, ec-
zema, bladder complaint, pimples?
Drink COLOSEPTIC in hot water
every morning. Try it for at least
seven days. COLOSEPTIC will
COLOSEPTIC LIKE MAGIC.—I bought a packet of COLOSEPTIC and have
been taking it faithfully. I would like to say that its effects on the bowels are
like magic. I have been suffering now with bowel trouble for 5 years and
my age is 32. Doctors wanted to operate 4 years ago, but I refused -

“Publicity? What do I care for pub-
licity ; my name is made. I have too
much of it, indeed . . . Very well, my
dear Georges, you may count on me.”
Flambin, too, saw the light. Odeon
promised to donate a picture, a good
one, and Hector had a striking bronze
which he was only too happy to give
to so worthy a cause.
Georges saw also Brisieux, the soon-
to-arrive violinist, and Marcelle Grieux,
the young soprano, both of whom had at
one time sheltered under Platapan’s hos-
pitable but leaky roof. As he had ex-
pected, they leaped at the chance of
being connected with so unique an affair
and of helping their old friend Platapan.
A few mornings later each of the lead-
ing Parisian dailies had a well-splashed
advertisement which read:
AT THE THEATRE GRANDCOURT.
On the 30th of the month, commencing
at 20 o’clock, there will be held
A GRAND CONCERT
in aid of that most deserving object,
M. Platapan’s Roof!
There followed a long and imposing
list of the eminent artistes who were to
appear, and the prices were so high as
to be interesting.
Georges had a persuasive way with his
fellow-scribes, and each paper had a well-
displayed article reading much as the
following:
Many people have sheltered beneath
M. Platapan’s benevolent roof. Some of
them have won fame, others have gone on
their way still unknown; but all cherish the
happiest recollections of M. Platapan and
his at one time excellent roof.
Now, alas, M. Platapan’s roof is old.
It weeps for the days of its youth, when
its every slate was new and glossy and
its rafters were in their prime. It was a
brave young roof in those days. Proudly
it defied snow, hail and rain, nor could
the most violent gale find a chink in its
armor.
M. Platapan’s roof is old, but those
over whom it has spread its protecting
wing remember its charity and rush gladly
to its aid. Flambin, the justly famous film
star; Godard, the glorious tenor; Mile.
Gerardy, who is singing her way to a last-
ing fame. These are a few of those who
remember and would repay. On the 30th
of the month at the Theatre Grandcourt
they will gladly give of their valuable time
in order to rush to the aid of their old
and well-beloved friend, M. Platapan’s
roof.
IN a moment, it seemed, all Paris was
* chuckling over this unique affair.
There was little of importance doing at
the time, and the papers seized it eagerly.
Even the sober “Le Matin” took it up,
and the afternoon sheets fairly leaped
at it.
Surely never did a roof in all France
ever receive such attention.
There were pictures galore of M.
Platapan’s doorway with M. Platapan
himself standing beside Mme. Platapan
and Isabelle, their beautiful daughter.
There were pictures of Mile. Gerardy
with her arm through M. Godard’s, both
standing in M. Platapan’s doorway.
There were pictures of Hector’s bronze
and Odeon’s landscape. And there were
pictures innumerable of the roof itself.
Photographers clambered up to points
of vantage and took its portrait from
every conceivable angle. One enterpris-
ing young man hired an aeroplane and
snapped it as he swept by.
Everywhere one looked, in fact, one
saw or read something of M. Platapan’s
by now famous roof, and although
Georges doubled the prices and then
doubled them again the entire theatre
was booked out in a week. A careful
check on the box-office figures showed
him that the affair should net a cool
hundred thousand francs at the least;
it was astounding. Since the whole cost
of the repairs should not be more than
twenty-five thousand it was apparent that
Isabelle would have a substantial dot.
A WEEK or so before the concert Lom-
bard, the master plumber and Plata-
pan’s brother-in-law, interviewed Georges.
“Congratulations,” he said warmly. “It
was a veritable stroke of genius.”
“It does well,” said Georges modestly.
“Of course,” proceeded Lombard non-
chalantly, “it is only fitting that as your
prospective father-in-law’s brother-in-law
I should have the job of repairing the
roof. The price would be low.”
“It will need to be very low indeed to
beat a quote I have had, which was five
thousand francs.” •
“Five thousand! Ten would be cheap
enough.”
“But think of the advertisement! The
plumber who repairs the roof will have
his name in the papers for weeks to
come free of cost. It will do you no
harm with that big contract which you
hope to land in the south.”
Yes, that is so. Lombard rumi-
nated, and then came to a decision “I
shall do it for four thousand, and that
is bedrock.”
“Make it two, and the job is yours.”
“Absurd! ” Lombard puffed himself up
like a turkey-cock.
“As you please.” An indifferent shrug.
“If I hang out no doubt somebody will
do it for nothing. It is only because you
are Isabelle’s uncle that I consider you
at all.”
Lombard writhed and protested—but
gave in.
So, too, did Burgundy, the painter, and
Jour, the paperhanger and decorator.
And on the whole three he impressed
the necessity of doing a good job, since
the result would undoubtedly appear in
many papers.
IT need scarcely be said that the con-
I cert was a huge success.
Never had Godard sung so magnifi-
cently or Flambin been more fascinating
and amusing. Mile. Gerardy was at the
top of her form, and Brisieux, the violin-
ist, excelled himself.
Odeon’s picture and Hector’s bronze
were put up for auction, and brought
amazing prices.
During the evening, Doubout, of the
famous publicity house of Doubout et
Fils, announced that young M. Georges
Bonnet, the clever organiser of the con-
cert and the fiance of Mile. Platapan,
had been engaged by his firm at a high
salary.
To sum up, the concert went with a
buzz and a sparkle from beginning to
end, and when at the last Platapan was
shoved on the stage to thank the artistes
he was so overcome by excitement and
happiness that he could only mop his
streaming brow and stammer.
NEXT day Georges settled accounts
with him.
It' pleased him to bring the whole of
the proceeds in cash, and he laid on
Platapan’s parlor table a tidy heap of
crisp thousand-franc notes.
“The net takings,” he crowed, indicat-
ing the heap proudly.
“For the roof,” he continued, abstract-
ing two of the bills, and apparently re-
ducing the heap not at all.
“No!” cried the amazed Platapan.
“For the roof,” repeated Georges
exultantly, and explained.
“Wonderful!” cried Madame, while
Platapan patted him on the back, and
Isabelle kissed him.
“And this,” cried Georges, taking two
more bills, “is for the painting, while
this”—taking one more—“is for the
decorating. The rest are for you, my
dear M. Platapan.”
“Not for me,” exclaimed the generous
little man, “but for Isabelle.” He handed
them to her with a flourish, and she
hugged him tenderly, so that what with
joy and relief he was almost in tears.
“How lucky I am to have such
friends,” he exulted. “Godard! Flam-
bin! Ah, the good fellows they are.
How generous, how very generous of
them to give of their valuable time and
talents to help me. Never, never shall
I cease to be grateful to them. I hope
they did not surrender an engagement
for last night just on my account,” he
concluded anxiously.
“Not they,” scoffed Georges. “And if
they did they would never miss the
money.”
“Do they, then, make so much?” asked
Platapan curiously.
“Make much?” Georges chuckled.
“Do you see this heap of notes? Godard
makes as much in a week, and Flambin
gets very little less.”
“A hundred thousand francs a week! ”
Platapan’s eyes bulged. “You joke!”
“Not I. I know it for a fact.”
“A hundred thousand francs a week,”
repeated Platapan strangely, sitting down
suddenly as if the shock was too much.
“Our friends have become famous
people,” said Madame proudly.
“A hundred thousand francs,” repeated
Platapan wonderingly. He put his hand
to his chin thoughtfully.
“A hundred thousand francs a week,”
he said again, “but nothing for poor
Platapan whose roof leaks.”
THEY stared at him as he rose slowly
and went to the door.
There he turned and faced them.
“A hundred thousand francs a week,”
he said plaintively, “and yet they did not
pay me.” He raised his eyebrows. “1
see! ”
He mumbled to himself as he trudged
up the stairs, and at the first landing
they heard him say: “Nothing for poor
Platapan!” and at the top: “Although
his roof leaks! ”
He rapped on M. Boulanger’s door,
and that young man came out briskly.
“Ah, M. Platapan!” he chuckled. “You
are over the concert all right, then?
What a success! What a furore!”
“My rent,” Platapan cut in harshly.
“Oh,” said Boulanger, stopping ab-
ruptly. “Well, I must confess I am a
little short at the moment, M. Platapan.”
“I must have my rent.”

“I have not a sou, not a single sou.”
“Then get out—at once.” Platapan’s
eyes were hard.
‘I see,” snapped Boulanger angrily,
“Very well, then.” He plunged his hand
into his pocket and produced two twenty-
ranc notes. . .
Take them, skinflint, he hissed.
From now on, M. Boulanger, said
his landlord, pocketing the notes and
moving away, “you pay regularly or go.”
“Miser!” bawled Boulanger after him,
and shaking his fist. “Robber! YoJ
will take the boots off my feet next.”
But Platapan was too intent to heed.
Mile. Carnot, of the third floor, ap-
peared promptly in response to his deter-
mined rapping.
“M. Platapan!” she cried happily.
“How glad I was of the so great success
of last evening!” She smiled at him
knowingly. “Your pockets are well
filled now.”
“Not with your money,” he retorted,
“I have come for my rent.”
“Eh?” she stammered “I am desolate,
my dear M. Platapan, but to-day I have
nothing. Next week, perhaps, my
uncle”
“From Fiji?” he asked shrewdly,
“Come now, my dear Mile. Carnot. I
have heard that too often; the thing
palls.”
“You insult me!” she blazed. “All
right, you old robber, you shall have
your money—but I leave.”
“So long as you pay,” he said coldly.
She disappeared, and returned in a few
moments with a little wad of notes which
she shoved into his waiting hand.
“I shall starve,” she wailed, “but I
would rather starve than owe such a
pinchfist whose pockets are bulging with
money. Oh, what a moneygrubbing
thief you are!”
She worked herself into a fury.
“Bandit!” she screamed. “Beside you
Shylock was a Christian.”
“Perhaps,” he agreed placidly. “But
never again shall l have to go cap in
hand to those who owe me A hun-
dred thousand francs a week —but
nothing for poor Platapan whose roof
leaks! Never again, I assure you.”
THAT was ten years ago, and to-day
Platapan is reputed to be one of
the hardest landlords in all Paris. But
his roof and those of the two apartment
houses he has acquired are in excellent
repair, and are likely to be.

Dog on a Chain.

“Mean to tell me you never let it off?”
“Yes.”
“Well, there have been complaints.

tonously. Bayliss sprang up with a
curse and grabbed the rifle from

early day he could see the outline of the
dog. He pumped a cartridge into the

across the ground the dog subsided.
“Hey!” a sleepy voice called out.
“What are you up to?”
“Oh, nuts,” Bayliss said, and went
back to bed.
Old Sid wandered out to investigate.
He stood for a moment propped against
the doorpost and looked about sleepily.
The dog cringed behind his box. Then,
shrugging his shoulders, Sid refilled the
tin and patted the dog.
LATER in the morning Sergeant Ken-
nedy picked his way up the track
towards the huts. The effort of getting
there had frayed his temper somewhat.
Nor did the continual yelping of Old
Sid’s dog as it came over the bush to
him improve his mood.
Old Sid sat lord and master in his
domain of tin-cans and bits of junk
which lay in a litter everywhere, with his
subject, the flea-bitten, scraggy carcass of
mangy hide, fretfully tugging at his chain.
Old Sid raised his eyes as the sergeant
came up.
“That your dog?” the sergeant de-
manded.
“Yes.”
“What’s it always yelping for like
that? Don’t you feed it?”
“It’s not always whining, and of course
I feeds it. All it wants is a little exercise.”
“Why the hell don’t you let it get
some?”
“I can’t let him off the chain. The
folks about here would shoot him.”
“Mean to say you never let him off?”
“Yes.”
“Well, there have been complaints.
They can hear it for miles. You will
have to stop it or destroy the dog. You’re
to get rid of the thing. Understand?”
FOR days Old Sid was undecided what
to do. Then one morning he came
out and found the dog really in pain on
the ground. He rubbed his chin perplex-
edly. Damn thing must have eaten too
much of that stale bread last night. He
stooped over the animal and felt its
shaggy belly. Couldn’t feel anything
there. The dog raised pleading brown
eyes and pawed him weakly. Old Sid
glanced about nervously. What should
he do? He glanced over to Bayliss’s hut.
Bayliss might know something.
BAYLISS was sitting in the sun clean-
ing his rifle. He looked up as Old
Sid approached and dropped his eyes
again silently. Old Sid advanced hesitat-
ingly and stood by the door for a few
minutes. After a while he said:
“Good day.”
“Good day,” returned Bayliss, and
waited unconcerned, plying his rag vig-
orously. Old Sid rubbed his leg and said
casually:
“Why don’t you get a dog? Be handy
for this fox game.”
Bayliss rubbed the barrel carefully
before replying.
“Too much to look after,” he said.
“Oh, I don’t know, and they're pretty
good company here,” offered Old Sid
mildly.
Bayliss grunted, and there was another
prolonged silence.
Old Sid picked up a stick and exam-
ined it; then, “Know anything about
dogs?” he asked.
Bayliss examined the front sight and
said offhand, “Not much.”
Silence again.
“I got a good dog over there,” said
Old Sid after a while.
Bayliss took down the rifle and gazed
down the barrel earnestly. “Yeah!”
“Yes,” said Old Sid, scratching on the
ground. They lapsed into silence again.
Then Old Sid picked up a stone and
tossed it into the bush. “He’s crook.”
Bayliss laid the barrel down, and, pick-
ing up the stock, began to work the
ejector.
“Yeah,” he commented tonelessly.
“I can’t tell what to do about it,”
offered Old Sid.
There was another long pause. Bay-
liss fitted up the rifle again, and, sliding
up the back sight, glanced down the
barrel. Old Sid kicked the ground.
“Come to have a look at him?” he
asked casually.
BAYLISS rose languidly and walked
over the clearing with his rifle under
his arm. Old Sid shuffled quietly behind.
They looked at the dog.
“He’s done,” said Bayliss.
Old Sid looked down on the prostrate
animal feebly pawing the ground.
“Couldn’t you do anything?”
“Yeah. Shoot him.”
Bayliss gazed at the rocks on the ridge
above him.
“Bad as that?”
“Nothing else to be done. It would
put the brute out of misery.”
Silence again. Then Old Sid hunched
himself up.
“Will you fix him?”
“Yeah.”
Bayliss walked a little way off and
raised his rifle.
Old Sid hurried into the hut out of
sight.
Bayliss took aim. The dog’s pleading
brown eyes watched him, and he lowered
the gun uncertainly. Hell! He walked
back to it and fumbled with the chain.
Weakly the thing tried to lick him in
gratitude, but he pushed it away and it
crawled off into the bush. As it dis-
appeared behind some scrub he fired,
grunted and went back to his hut.
OLD SID did not come out again, and
the thought troubled Bayliss all day
as he messed about the camp. As the
evening sun glided down through the
ranges he stood for a moment watching
the other camp. Presently, grumbling a
curse, he took a spade and walked over
to Old Sid’s hut again. Poor old cow,
he thought. He was attached to the
mong. He collected the dead dog and
went off down the bush to bury it.

For Constipation Leads
To Endless Trouble
Nature has decreed that the Bowels shall
operate regularly —at least once a day.
Defiance or neglect of this law leads to many
kinds of suffering, including Headaches, Bad
Breath, Biliousness, Indigestion, Pimples, etc.
Constipation also makes you look and feel
dull, bad tempered and livery.
Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills are a proved
remedy for regulating the Bowels and re-
storing the system to proper working order,
in a thorough, yet gentle manner.
A course will convince.

CRANKY
CHILDREN
Are Often the
Victims of Worms.
A child who is affected with Thread
Worms will often appear to the eye to be
in an indifferent state of health. It be-
comes peevish and irritable in its temper.
Another point to which the attention of
mothers should be specially directed is.
that the child is apt to start in its sleep,
its repose being in the way of a disturbed
nature.
Unfortunately, many mothers fail to
recognise the fact that their little ones are
suffering intense pain and distress, and are
practically irresponsible for the outbursts
of temper, restlessness and peevishness,
and until some more serious symptoms
appear nothing is done to alleviate the
distress. The symptoms of this disease are
somewhat variable, but generally they are
so characteristic that no mother need have
any doubt. The best proof of worms is
worms, and if the general conduct of the
child is such as to cause the slightest
suspicion, a careful watch will give ample
proof.
Worms, by their movements and the
interruption they offer to the contents of
the bowels, generally occasion pain or
uneasiness in the abdomen, sometimes
spasmodic, sometimes gnawing and bit-
ing, and not infrequently of a vague,
indescribable character, and yet very dis-
tressing. Sympathetic with this is a
sensation of itching at the nostrils, pro-
ducing a disposition to pick the nose,
which is characteristic of the affection.
The bowels are often disordered, some-
times relaxed, as in dysentery. The
appetite is exceedingly variable ; in some
cases natural, in others deficient, craving
or depraved, one condition not infre-
quently alternating with another. The
abdomen is often hard, swollen and tym-
panetic, the breath heavy or foetid, and
tongue furred, with disagreeable taste,
and a copious flow of saliva ; swelling
of the upper lip, bleeding of the nostrils,
and disposition to grind the teeth during
sleep are other characteristic symptoms.
The effects, however, often extend be-
yond the alimentary canal, and various
derangements of health are experienced
in consequence either of the direct irri-
tation of the worms or of the disordered
digestion which they occasion. Among
the most common of these are nervous
affections, such as fretfulness, irritation
of temper, wakefulness, or disposition
to excessive sleep, disturbed sleep, sud-
den starting out of sleep as if from fright,
dizziness, spasmodic movements of the
eyelids, temporary blindness and deaf-
ness, and have ceased on their expulsion.
Comstock’s “Dead Shot” Worm Pellets
are a purely vegetable medicinal prepara-
tion compounded on a scientific principle
for the eradication of worms,, which
infest the intestines. They contain specific
properties which destroy the worms but
cause no injury to the stomach or bowels,
and do not weaken the system. The
pellets are prepared in the form of a
confection, or lolly, have no disagree-
able taste or smell, but, on the contrary,
inspire children to take them as they
would an ordinary sweet.
Obtainable at all chemists and stores,
or direct from the W. H. Comstock Co.,
Ltd., 23 Lang Street, Church Hill, Syd-
ney. Price 2/- per packet (six packets

FENCE POSTS will not burn
“WARATAH” Hinged Joint Fence
for Sheep, Cattle, Pigs, etc.
“WARATAH” WIRE-NETTING . ..
100 per cent. Australian, from the iron ore to the fence. Waratah
wire-netting protects sheep, pigs, poultry and pastures from the ravages
of rabbits, wild dogs, and other vermin. Rylands stand behind all
Waratah products. Every roll of netting and coil of wire bears their
identification disc. Preserve this—it is your protection. Rylands have
a suitable product for every fencing purpose, and, if you are in doubt
as to the right type of materials for specific uses, they invite you to
avail yourself of their technical service. Keep Australian workmen
employed. An assured home consumption is your best market. Aus-
tralians consume 60 per cent, of tbe total primary production of the
Commonwealth. Four Australian workmen and their families lose
their livelihood for a week every time a mile of imported netting is
used. Specify Rylands Waratah wire-netting, and see that you get it.
