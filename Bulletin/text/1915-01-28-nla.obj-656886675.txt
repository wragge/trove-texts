War
A war book that contrives to say some-
thing new is The Kaiser’s War, by Austin
Harrison, the editor of The English Re-
view (Allen and Unwin, 2s.)* Harrison, a
son of Frederick Harrison, has lived in Ger-
many, and is familiar with Hogman thought,
diplomacy and life. And he has a warning
for us—this war is not yet won, nor will it
be won unless we put every ounce into the
struggle, every possible man into the
trenches. He lets us see the servility in
which, throughout all forms of civic life, every
Hogman is held. “Drunk with the success of
1870 the German people have placed their
souls in the keeping of the Kaiser... .No
nation ever went into war with a clearer
sense of its national responsibility. No
ruler ever declared war with a fuller weight
of support behind him. . . .The whole machine
of German government, life, administration
and organisation was founded and run for
the purpose of war, and was so accepted by
the German people.”
It is, however, on the topic ,of the bru-
tality of the Hun that Harrison interests us
most. The individual Hogman is not cruel,
but he is instinctively and almost purposely
brutal. It is part of his method, his inten-
tion to assert himself (sick imponieren) re-
gardless of means and cost. “This attitude
has a terminology of its own. ‘Fixieren,’ to
fix a man with the eyes, is a recognised Ger-
man practice, and has been the cause of
many a fatal duel.” It consists merely in
staring at a man in a cafe; in University
corps circles the man who refuses to send
round his card at another fellow who has
“fixed” him is ostracised as a coward. An-
other term is “rolling the eyes.” “Absurd
as it may appear, this rolling the eyes is a
recognised German sign of temper, the pre-
lude to disciplinary chastisement. _ The
sergeants use it to awe and hold in the
men. Thus if a private, struck on the face
by a corporal for having a button off his
coat, shows resentment by rolling his eyes,
he is liable to further correction, as the
corporal would be if he rolled his eyes at a
sergeant, and the sergeant would be if he
rolled his eyes at a lieutenant, or a workman
would be for rolling his eyes at a foreman,
or a waiter for rolling his eyes at a head 1 -
waiter. All this, of Course, comes from the*
Army. It is the civilian’s way of showing
what a soldier boy he is. With this there
is the forefinger sign, the most common
gesture of modern Germany... .All over
Germany mothers shake their forefingers at
their children. All over Germany men shake
their forefingers at those beneath them....
It represents the civic counterpart of the
military doctrine of ‘striking terror,’ whence
it derives. In a word, it is the justification
of the bully, the social gesture of the strong
man *who dominates by force and intimida-
tion As in the Army the idea of
camaraderie between officers and men _ is
quite foreign to the military idea, so in civil
life the system of command and bullying, of
authority and obedience, obtains to a degree
unknown and unthinkable in any other
country in Europe.* If a German wants a
waiter, he calls out “Mr. Head Waiter”
(Herr Oher), or the waiter, feeling himself
insulted, refuses to come and rolls his eyes
....If you want to please a German you
address him as Yon when you know he is a
plebeian.”
Brutality is a recognised part of the
military system. “It has led not only to an
extraordinary brutality of manner and atti-
tude among the people, but _to positive
ferocity. Anything more sickening than the
brutality with which horses are treated in
Germany it would be difficult to imagine....
If a horse stumbles (in the army) the driver
rolls his eyes, gathers up-the reins, and beats
it until he is out of breath; nor would any-
one in the street venture to protest... .The
bullied victim of the sergeant feels he has
the. right to bully his horse or underling on
the principle of ‘smash your way through.’”
Harrison instances the Eulenburg scandal,
the suicide of the Kaiser’s great friend Krupp
from a similar charge brought against him
by Vorwabts, and the extraordinary sym-
pathy extended to Wilde as pathological
symptoms of the greatest importance. He
mentions one well-known result in Berlin
of the Wilde boom. And “Berlin, which had
come to be a Gehenna of prostitution and
dissipation, boasted of its vices.” One of
the phenomena of modern Germany is _■ the
everyday occurrence of the rape, of little
girls, and the penalty is merely a few months’
imprisonment! The Army officer is bound
to “defend his honor by force.” /He may
not accept an apology in the event of a
technical assault. Thus a man who on leav-
ing a cafd, for example, brushes against an
officer, is technically liable to be cut down.
Cases of this kind are of constant occurrence.
Only a short while back an officer shot a
man in a big Berlin cafd who had stumbled
over his foot. An insult to the uniform is
punishable by death The brutalities com-
mitted by the German soldiers in the field
are the logical result of the German military
system In the German Armies we are
fighting a doctrine of brutality, a national
attitude.”
It is this intelligent brutality and Hogman
hate of England that we have to exterminate.
This hatred is no artificial product capable
of adjustment through the soothing influ-
ences of time and persuasion: it is a racial
philosophy of life. Hogmany is incapable of
ever forgiving England. No parchment docu-
ments can settle this war. “From hence-
forth the war bears the character of this
racial hatred which aims at our destruction.
We must reckon with every conceivable act
of German diplomatic treachery and machi-
nation; we must prepare for every possible
surprise If there is any Englishman to-
day who expects that on the termination
of the war Britain and Germany will shake
hands and forget, he must be indeed a pretty
simpleton. The Germans will not forget
From now onwards the Germans and the
British face one another as implacable foes
fighting for their respective existences. We
are the enemy the Germans seek to destroy.
Either they succeed or we as ruthlessly
destroy them But to belittle German
arms is merely foolish. The German advance
on Paris was an astonishing feat The
Allied Armies are fighting the most powerful
enemy that ever took the field of battle, a
people who will go down fighting.. Against
the military organisation and spirit of Ger-
many the idea of a speedy-victory must be
put aside Though there have been 50
battles, each as big as Waterloo, there has
been so far no decision. . . .It remains, to be
seen whether we can afford to fight this war
on our traditional military method of limited
liability!”
Harrison’s book is merely another letter
of the writing on the wall—the completion
of which spells : Conscription.
The French Army from Within (25.,
Hodder and Stoughton) gives a lucid
account of the war organisation of our
Ally. From the age of 20 to that of 45
every Frenchman physically capable of
military service is a soldier. There are no
exemptions. Three of his 25 years of ser-
vice are spent in the active army, 11 are
spent in the reserve, during which term he
is recalled to the colors, for service with the
active army, for two periods of a month at
a time. The remainder of his service is in
the Territorial Army, and then in that
army’s reserve. Being a conscript, the
French soldier’s rate of pay is very low.
He begins with about a halfpenny a day.
The author says that Conan Doyle’s
Brigadier Gerard still remains the por-
trait of the French cavalry officer and man.
He boasts inordinately, but not without
reason. He boasts —and acts, too; like the
Englishman, he does his work, and, unlike
the Englishman, he talks about it. But the
modern Gerard takes his work far more
seriously. He is first a soldier and after
that a man. Some interesting details are
given of the French disciplinary battalions,
which are not to be confused with the
Foreign Legion. Service in the Foreign
Legion is a voluntary matterthe discip-
linary battalions are necessary in a country
where the army draws into its net the
criminal classes and wasters.
A popular edition of _ The Quintessence of
Nietzsche, by J. M. Kennedy, first published
in 1909, is now published by Laurie at Is.
as plain Nietzsche. The publisher, for
reasons of his own, quotes on the cover:
“The Mind that Caused the Great War”;
but if he had taken the trouble to read
Kennedy’s new preface he would have seen
that Nietzsche had nothing to do with the
present unpleasantness. “In Germany
Nietzsche was howlejj down and driven into
intellectual exile; his followers there have
fared little better. The Germans have never
forgiven him his sneers at their modern
‘culture’—the very thing we are now sneer-
ing at ourselves! More than 30 years ago
Nietzsche predicted what the Germany of
1914 was going to be like; and he criticised
her barbarism, her ‘culture,’ her lack of
ideals much better, and with sounder know-
ledge than any English critic has done
since the AVar began. „
“Those who regard Nietzsche as the
founder of the new Germany are greatly in
error With bitter sincerity he criticised
the Germany of his own time; and in even
stronger terms the Germany which was de-
veloping out of it. In a word, he deplored
the effect which he realised the ‘Empire’
would have on the real culture of Germany;
on the Germany of Goethe. Every. other
philosopher, historian, student and scientist
took precisely the opposite view, and con-
demned Nietzsche accordingly.” Treitzschke
was the real intellectual leader of modern
Germany. “Nietzsche saw in Germany
merely a raw, arrogant, conceited bundle
of States, loosely joined in an artificial em-
pire. There is no German professor living
who would make the mistake of ascribing
to Nietzsche any connection with the War.”
Accordingly, Nietzsche is let off with the
usual caution.
&
Arnold Bennett chifts in: one expected
him to chip in. Liberty (Hodder and Stough-
ton, Is.) is light reading, in the facile
Bennett style. “The Austro-Servian diffi-
culty was the occasion, not the cause, of
the European war. It was not even one of
the causes. It was like a match, picked out
of a box of matches by an incendiary, to set
light to a house previously well soaked in
kerosene. To study the half-burnt match,
to stick it under a microscope and differ-
entiate it from other matches, would be a
supreme exercise in absurdity.” Bennett
calls the attention of the U.S.A. to General
von Edelsheim’s memorandum, Operations
TJpon the Sea, as to the proper way to de-
feat the U.S. Yon Edelsheim begins by
stating that Germany cannot meekly submit
to “the attacks of the U.S.A.” for ever, and
that she must ask herself how she can “im-
pose her will.” He shows how easy it would
he, if Germany were at war (alone) with
the U.S., to land troops, destroy New York’s
skyscrapers, and levy heavy contributions
from the city millionaires. The book,
Bennett says, is deservedly popular just now
in that neutral country. “In joining in this
war Great Britain had nothing to gain, but
she had something to keep—her word to Bel-
gium—and she had everything to lose by
standing out of it. Hence she is in it. A
German Major-General writes: All Bel-
gium must become German, not in order
that a few million rascals may have the
honor of belonging to the German Empire,
but so that we may have her excellent
harbors anu be able to hold the knife under
the nose of perfidious, cowardly England.
Pleasant neighbors, the Hogmen would be!
In November Scribneb’s Galsworthy
writes characteristically of the War. He
sees in it the death of mystic Christianity.
“When this War is over and reason resumes
its Sway, our dogmas will be found to have
been scored through for ever.” The new
Christianity “will be ashamed to offer
appeals to God to put right that which man
has bungled; of supplications to the Deity
to fight against the Deity.” _ And,. too, he
sees the- end of despotisms, including that
of Russia. Ide asks for universal service,
secured by this yale key: “that no man shall
be called upon under any circumstances to
fight one step outside his native land.” And as
to Culture, all he has to say, and all he need
say, is “Culture ! You wreckers of Louvain!

From ihe Trenches: Louvain to the Aisne,
by Geoffrey Young (Unwin; 25.), is the usual
detailed record of the usual special corres-
pondent who, from a fog of little facts, fails
to evoke - the actuality of warfare. It is
magnificent journalism, but it isn’t war.
He quotes, however, some typical soldiers
letters from the Front, utterly lacking in the
picturesque touches that fill so much . space
in the newspaper quotations. This is the
sort of letter Tommy usually writes: “Dear
Dad,—This is the first time I have written,
and I have had no letter. Please write soon,
and ask Mum and sisters to I am
quite well, as I hope this finds you. It is
very hot, and it is bad for the horses. . Baby
Bob must be a big chap now. Give him my
love. Tell all to write and send some cigar-
ettes. I will not write any more, so will

An extremely valuable compilation is
Germany’s War Mania (Shaw, London,
25.), in which the Teutonic point of view
is officially stated from the speeches and
writings of the persons who soon will be
singing “The Hog-wash of the Swine.” It
is characteristic that out of the 260 pages
of this compilation 100 pages are allotted
to the Kaiser. The other unwilling con-
tributors are the Crown Prince, Bethmann-
Hollweg, Bulo\y, Bernhardi, Goltz, Clause-
witz, Treitschke and Delbriick. These selec-
tions from the voluminous war literature
of Hogmany make it fatally clear that the
policy of the Hogmen was not a secret one
of a small group of militarists around the
Kaiser, a policy to which the Hogman people
have been compelled to assent after its
results were upon them, but a public policy,
thoroughly explained, as to intentions and
plans, to the whole population. “German
newspapers and periodicals, German gov-
ernment and military officials, ■ German
educators and authors, German leagues and
associations have been preaching these
ideals and aims and policies far and wide
to the German millions every hour of the
day, both before, and especially since,
William 11. came to the throne in. 188 S.
The purpose' of this book is to give to
English readers an authoritative account of
the war mania, a veritable German gospel
of blood and iron, which has been
deliberately brought into being by the arti-
ficial stimulation of Teutonic sentiment for
the last 43 years.” By these ideals the
whole life and thought and action of the
nation is permeated and ruled.
In the course of the Kaiser’s speeches he
calmly calls himself a fool and a criminal.
Some years ago he stated: “I regard as a
fool and a criminal whoever would impel
these two nations (France and Hogmany)
to go to war/’ In 1892 he called himself
the protector of European peace; and he
has many inspiriting things to say of the
way in which his army works for peace,
Hogmany’s-divine civilising mission and his
cobber, God. In 1892 he had “the firm
conviction that He, our old ally of Ro.ssbach
von Dennewitz, will not leave me in the
lurch. He has given Himself such endless
trouble with our old Mark and with our
House that we can assume that he has not
done this for nothing” !
In speaking of the Hogman navy Biilow
stated that they must create a fleet strong
enough to make an attack, and added, I
underline the word ‘attack.’” Bernhardi is
honestly frank: “A further questmn, sug-
gested by the present political position, is
whether all the political treaties which were
concluded at the beginning of _ the'last cen-
tury under quite other conditions in tact,
under a different conception of what consti-
tutes a State —can, or ought to be. perma-
nently observed.” He instances Belgium.
But he has his doubts about Austria if Hog-
many is defeated by Russia. He suggests
that the Austrian Government cannot com-
mand the patriotism of its warring racial
elements to fight to the death with Russia.
Yet, “World-power or downfall!’ Amen.
Delbriick also calls himself a liar. Ihe
!ermany of to-day, let us imagine her ever
> strong, would certainly never begin a
ar.”
&
For those who like this sort of thing
lere are cheap editions of The Secret His-
)ry of the Court of Berlin, edited by Henry
7. Fischer (Long, Is.) containing “the pri-
ite lives of William 11. and his Consort”;
nd Behind the Scenes at the Court of
ienna (Long, 25.), edited by Henri de
giving “the private life of the
ustrian Emperor.” In both cases the
lformation has been allegedly gained from
le mouths of distinguished persons at the
ourts. More valuable, however, is The
’aiser Unmasked, by Frank Mundel (Jar-
aid, 1/6), which gives all the significant
xtracts from the Kaiser’s speeches, with
ie necessary comments, with a view to the
idication of his character and peculiar be-
efs.
&
The “authentic” biography of Sir John
I rench, by Cecil Chisholm (Jenkins, Is.) is
bly and succinctly done. French, accord-
ag to Field-Marshal Evelyn Wood, is “the
ian, who for the last 12 years has been the
riving force of tactical instruction in the
Jritish Army.” History will give him a
reater title, but none more worthy. “If
don’t end my days as a Field-Marshal it
nil not be for want of trying, and—well,
’m jolly well going to do it,” said French
nany years ago to a group of brother officers.
Ind “French’s luck” has become, almost a
lervice proverb. Of course, it isn’t luck.
Tolm Denton Pinkstone French had to wait
or his promotion. He started life in the
iavy, served four years as a cadet, and
shucked it for the army. And even the army
ie had to enter by the back-door—a com-
nission in the militia. Though the Boer
iVar brought his name into the mouths of
;he people, he had won his spurs long be-
fore on the Nile. “If one were asked to
lescribe the man, one might best answer
;hat he is an Englishman to the nth degree.
The dour urbanity of Kitchener is
Oriental rather than English, and contrasts
strangely with the choleric tradition of the
army officer. So the infinite alertness and
constant good humor of Roberts has a
quality of Latin esprit very foreign to the
English temperament. But there are no
such peculiarities about French. He is the
very essence of healthy normality. xet
French’s steadfast object of admiration is
Napoleon, Napoleon the strategist. It was
his worship of his hero that made him per-
sonally familiar with the. whole of the Bel-
gian battleground. And in his rapidity of
thought there is a striking resemblance be-
tween the two figures. He bears, too, a
striking resemblance to Joffre, in physique,
character and temperament. “Each finds
himself eternally compared to . General
Grant!” He is a man of few sayings; but
two deserve quotation. „ “I’ve never, done
yet 'anything worth doing without having to
screw myself up to it.” And, “All wars
are abnormal, because there is no such thing
as normal war.”
d)t
An altogether charming production is The
Child’s ABC of the War, by Geoffrey
Whitworth and Stanley North (Allen and
Unwin, Is.). “J,” as every kid now knows,
stands for Jellicoe, and it is unnecessary to
laention for whom “K” stands. The illus-
rations, in brilliant primary colors and the
[uaintest of simple designs, are full of kiddie
nterest.
I’he Kaiser Under the Searchlight, by A.
3. Catling (Unwin, Is.), is scrappy and
nerely journalistic. Catling’s, searchlight
shows nothing new, except possibly some de-
sails about the Kaiser’s withered arm, with
she suggestion that this serious deformity
las had a life-long influence upon the
Kaiser’s mind.
Two valuable popular editions of German
war literature are Bernhardi’s Hoio Germany
Makes War, a condensed edition of On War
of To-Day, and The Nation in Arms, by
Field-Marshal von Goltz, a condensed edition
of the work orginally published at 7s. 6d.
Each volume is now published at 2s. (Hod-
der and Stoughton).
Keep Smiling (6d.; Nash) contains “news
by liarless for German homes” and illustra-
tions by John Hassall. The humor of it is
rather obvious and stodgy, but the Hassall
illustrations are excellent.
®
Science Progress, the five-shilling quar-
terly issued by Murray, is probably the only
periodical that does not mention the war.
It hasn’t time. The October issue is con-
cerned with Vitamines, Smoke-abatement
(not on the battle-field), Theories of Dyeing
(not dying), Germ-cycles (not German
armored motor-cars) and other peaceful
and innocuous subjects. One article,
delightfully riddling the dead science
of Logic, is almost worth the five
bob. “Everyone who has ever looked
into a book of Logic says to himself, This
is all very well: these simple arguments are
valid, no doubt, but what piffle they are.
Then the author, C. A. Mercier, proceeds to
break every rule of the construction of the
syllogism, with the most ludicrous examples,
and triumphantly draws valid Conclusions.
One wonders if logic is still taught in Aus-
tralasian universities —and if professional
logicians ever read Science Progress?

A WORD TO THE WISE.
It is an open secret that prices of all imported manu=
factured articles must considerably advance, owing
to a set of circumstances arising from the struggle
for supremacy now raging in Europe. The enhanced
factory cost, increase in freights, war insurance and
exchange rates have sent up prices with a run.
In addition to this, the Revised Australian Tariff
imposes higher duties, which are now being collected,
thereby still further increasing the cost. The
goods we offer at BEFORE=THE=WAR prices are
GENUINE BARGAINS, quite apart from the Real
Reductions in prices of commodities offered at
ANTHONY HORDERNS’ FAMOUS SALE PRICES.
Many thousands of Big Bargains are set out in the
SALE LIST. Write for a copy ; posted free on re=
quest. It will enable you to reap the full measure

A WORLD’S RECORD TARGET.
Composite target (reduced 3/16 of an inch) of
200 shots fired by G. W. Chesley in ten different

If you go in for target shooting or hunt with a .22
caliber rifle, of course you want to excel. To do so
you must use uniform, dependable ammunition.
Some makes of cartridges are as variable as the
weather. Some shots go high, some go low, and some don’t go at
all. For accuracy and all around satisfaction, you can bank on
WINCHESTER
.22 Caliber Cartridges
In all kinds of shooting they continue to excel. They are made by people who
have learned in making firearms many fine points about cartridges that could be
learned in no other way. No matter what the make or style of your favorite arm is,
you can bring out its possibilities to the fullest degree by using Winchester make

HERE are five reasons why you
should have a bicycle built of
Genuine B.S.A. Fittings in preference
to a cheap ‘pattern’ machine: —
1. You get far better value.
2. You get greater reliability.
3. You get an easier running machine.
4. You get economy in upkeep.
5. Yon get a much higher price for the
bicycle when you want to sell it.
In fact you get more enjoyable cycling always.
There’s no doubt a B.S.A. is cheapest in the end.
But apart from that you have a machine you will
always be proud of. How would you like to go out
with friends all riding B.S.A’s—yours a cheap
pattern machine ? Not at all! Then ride a bicycle
built of genuine B.S.A. fittings.

THIN WOMEN!
What is more pitiable than a pretty woman whose neck, arms and
scraggy chest destroy her every chance of ' being really charming ?
Nothing gives charm to a woman so much as does a full, well-rounded,
perfectly-developed figure. If you lask it, science will enable you to
obtain it.
WHEN you look into the mirror and your
hollow cheeks, thin neck and scrawny
arms mock even you, what effect do
you supposp they have on those with whom
you mix socially ?A woman’s chief charm
is a well-rounded figure and full bosom. With
these, thin arms and hollow cheeks are a
rarity.
If your bust lacks development, and you
are scraggly and attenuated, we will advise
you free and gladly as to how you may im-
prove your figure and beautify, your bust.
We are only too pleased to tell you the
secret, for we know it cannot fail, and that
in a few weeks you will be-happier, healthier
and more sought after socially than in your
present undeveloped, emaciated condition.
Thousands of women suffering the ravages
of ill-health have sought and accepted this ad-
vice, and to-day are models of womanly de-
velopment and examples of perfect health.
The same success awaits your call. In the
wake of attenuation follow such complaints
as constipation, indigestion, bilious head-
aches, internal functional derangements, etc.
As your development advances and weight im-
proves, these gradually disappear and perfect
health results.

to refund fee if satisfactory results do not
follow the use of the treatment. SEND FOR

my appetite is keen, I enjoy my meals,

rounded, and my health is splendid.

STOP
SMOKING!
MOST MEN would cure themselves of the
Tobacco habit if they knew they could
do so easily and without discomfort.
It takes but ten minutes for tobacco to
change the beats of the heart. To keep it up
is to tempt death by Heart Disease, Nervous
Collapse, Tobacco Cancer, and Stomach,
Liver or Kidney Disease.
TOBACCO SPECIFIC is a harmless, vege-
table remedy that will make the user of
tobacco in any form absolutely abandon the
habit for good. It not only destroys the crav-
j 11 o' the desire, the appetite for tobacco, but
restores to health the entire nervous system,
and aids nature in entirely eliminating from
the system the Nicotine Poison.
You Can Try It FREE.

Thu Decline and Fall of Whiskers.
Though long ago Man lost his fur,
Till lately he retained a relic
Trimmed so to make the ladies purr
Of whiskers “lovely” and “angelic.
Dundrearies, sad and long like weeds,
Assisted old-time beaux to win her;
Chin-mats served other fellows’ needs;
“Moustachios” aided many a sinner.
The old-time girls were hard to please;
Regardless of all climes and weathers,
They loved to see men on their knees,
Their features hid in human feathers.
This is a boyish, bare-faced age, _
And pink-cheeked oldsters play with dap-
pers,
While ancient ladies, in a rage,
Ask why they’ve dropped the old face-
wrappers.
But here and there some mildewed beau
Retains his make-up like a poodle;
The man who will not let ’em grow
He bluntly calls “a perfect noodle. ’
Alas! such woolly heroes are
Too few indeed for comic draughtsmen,
Who dog a shaggy whisker-star
And criticise his points like craftsmen.
The sofa-stuffing melts away
In this keen age of safety razors;
A full set wins a mad “Hooray !”
Prom any group of whisker-gazers.
Even the false grey whisker-mats
The Druids wore are gone to glory ;
Now only tigers, rats and cats
Still wear the things. A gloomy story !

KODAK.
Callaghan’s Hotel.
There’s the same old coaching stable that
was used by Cobb and Co.,
And the yard the coaches stood in more
than sixty years ago;
And the public private parlor, where they
serve the passing swell,
Was the shoeing forge and smithy up at
Callaghan’s Hotel.
There’s the same old walls and woodwork
that our fathers built to last,
And the same old doors and wainscot and
the windows of the past;
And the same old nooks and corners where
the Jim-Jams used to dwell;
But the Fantods dance no longer up at
Callaghan’s Hotel.
There are memories of old days that were
red instead of blue;
In the time of “Dick the Devil and ot
other devils too;
But perhaps they went to Heaven and are
angels, doing well — :
They were always open-hearted up at
Callaghan’s Hotel.
Now there’s ouiet-voiced, crook business, if
there is no horseplay there;
And you’re robbed in peace and comtort
and you’re cleaned out unaware;
And you’re shot out empty-handed when
you’re down and sufficing Hell—
There’s no friend like Dick the Devil up at
Callaghan’s Hotel.
And I sit and think in sorrow of the nights
that I have seen,
When we fought with chairs and bottles
for the orange and the green;
For the peace of poor old Ireland, till they
rang the breakfast bell —
And the honor of Old England, up at
Callaghan’s Hotel.

Bold eyes that dance delirium;
Rouged, mocking lips that taunt the shame
Of their pale sister of the slum.
A pallid phantom born of night.
Her mirthless eyes and lips invite
Where shadows linger ; while, nearby.
Pass sweethearts linked with love s delight.
Her life a combat -with Desire,
A fatal and mysterious lire,
Burns redly in a ceaseless flame
As redly as a funeral pyre.
Her trysting-plaee is dark and mean;
Her tragic eyes may there be seen
A-shine o’ nights no eye may see
The darkness of the days between.
Unhallowed and unorthodox,
She goes unloved in tinselled frocks,
With yearning eyes for Love-in-Lace
Escorted to the theatre-box.
Night holds the sorrow of the earth
Close to her bosom —knows the worth
Of tears and laughter, folly, love;
Night hath her meed of grief and mirth.
Her love-dreams died ’mid ugly things
That hid life’s loveliness; ’mid stings
And smarts of loneliness she dreamed...
Love passed unheeding sorrowings.
And as she dreamed there came a sound,
As ’twere a seeking monster found
A priceless morsel to devour;
His stealthy feet trod holy ground.
’Twas but the footstep of her fate!
A child of love denied a mate,
She woke from dreams to face the world
Unmoral and degenerate.
What is the measure of her sin?
Her soul is dead, yet deep within
Her heart still burns the flame of love,
A flame unsteady, dim and thin._

WHEN THE BOTTOM FALLS OUT.
The British Government, which is troubled,
like Martha of the Scripture, by many
affairs, has explained the situation in a
friendly manner to the borrowers who call
so regularly at the door. John Bull wants
money for the war. He wants much money.
He may want almost unlimited money.
Already he has added about £60,000,000 a
year to his taxes, and over £300,000,000 to
his public debt, and what will happen later
on he doesn’t know. France and Russia,
the other two reasonably financial Allies,
don’t know either, but the struggle may last
for a long, long time, and the affluent Allies
have to find money for the dead-broke Allies —
Belgium, Servia and Montenegro—because
their fighting capacity can’t be dispensed
with even though their pockets are empty.
So the Bull Parliament has taken posses-
sion of the London Stock Exchange. _ _ It
intimates that when a colony or Dominion
has to renew a loan that is falling due no
difficulty will be put in the way. But if it
desires to float a new loan for “permanent
and reproductive works,” or any other of the
old familiar devices, it must get permission.
And the permission will only be granted
“where it is proved, that urgency and special
circumstances exist.” If Bull hardens his
heart like the Pharaoh of Egypt, and lives
up to his announcement, that is the end of
Australian foreign loans while the war lasts.
This country, with its boast of high wages,
short hours, easy conditions, magnificent
natural resources, and “permanent and
reproductive works,” has about the poorest
show on earth to set up a claim of “urgency
and special circumstances.” In the early
days of the war Britain financed us with
a war loan of £18,000,000 or £19,000,000,
and the money, instead of being reserved for
military and naval purposes, was passed out
to the States to keep the Public Works boom
going, and to prop up the policy of importing
cheap-labor goods and nigger goods and
“scab” goods to the detriment of local
employment. There will be no more relief
of the sort for a long while unless we can
persuade certain folk in authority that we
are a very hungry lot, or unless special
lunacy is admitted as an extenuating
circumstance. ' # *
The question arises whether anything is
being done to meet the very probable
oujgrg6iicy, or whether Australia proposes
to drift along to the last moment, and then
sit up suddenly in the middle of the night
and realise that it has been entertaining a
bailiff unawares. Our present position may
be summed up thus: —
(1) This heavily indebted country believes in
high wages and a low tariff.
(2) It also believes in high-class trades-unionism,
and in the lavish admission of non-union goods.
(3) It objects to the nigger, but believes in
admitting his goods.
(4) It imports so much and, by comparison, exports
so little that it depends on foreign loans to pay for
quite a considerable amount of its goods.
(5) It now depends wholly on foreign loans to
pay the interest on its foreign debt.
(6) Because it imports so much it has compara-
tively little local employment; an absurd 1 ." small
population (its artisans being in otner countries
instead of here) ; few local taxpayers, and few local
defenders. Also, the debt burden is twice as much
per head as it would be supposing there were twice
as many people.
(7) The loan money which is brought into the
country to prevent it being emptied of legal tender in
payment for cheap-labor imports must be put into
circulation somehow. Much of it goes to build pub-
lic works which are unprofitable through lack of
people to use them. In New South Wales more than
half the railway mileage is now run at a loss.
(8) Loan money leads to industrial demoralisation
and inefficiency. Anybody can be paid 20s. for work
that isn’t likely to pay interest on more than 10s.
provided the bill is charged to posterity.
(9) The oftener a man is paid 20s. for 10s. worth
of work the more likely he is to vote for the thrift-
less Premier who found him the job. Also, the
madder he will be at that Premier when the job
falls through. Consequently there is an increased
probability that that Premier will appoint himself
Agent-General in the day of trouble, and flee to
England on a useless undertaking at a big salary.
(10) Meanwhile local industry tends to be of
inferior quality for two reasons: (a) It only gets
the crumbs of business that remain after the rich
Tory importer—often a foreigner—is satisfied, con-
sequently the manufacturer can’t afford the best
appliances; (6) the industries which can only pay
according to the value of the output (said value
being regulated by foreign competition) are in con-
stant competition with the loan industries which
cheerfully charge the wages bill to unborn genera-
tions.
* * * *
The loan boom is now doing what may
prove its last lap—or the last one for a very
long time —and it only does that because the
British Government, as already mentioned,
financed a large Federal advance for war
purposes (which amount seems to have
somehow been temporarily diverted to State
public works) ; and, in a less degree, because
the Private Enterprise banks were
persuaded to put up £10,000,000 to keep
things going. These streaks of luck can’t
be expected to repeat themselves indefinitely.
When the loans are suspended Australia
must either manufacture for itself some
£20,000,000 or £30,000,000 worth more goods
per annum, or else go without. To go
without signifies a relapse into a more or
less aboriginal condition. To increase local
manufactures on the scale required is
difficult for four reasons, as follows: —
(X) Lack of skilled labor. The loan and public
works policy makes the pick-and-shoveller multiply
exceedingly, while by reason of the importing policy
our skilled artisans are mostly in foreign countries.
(2) Lack of time for preparation. Industries can’t
be improvised in a day.
(3) Lack of a sane tariff. No manufacturer can
get the money for a heap of new machinery if it is
understood that he is merely keeping the seat warm
for the German or other alien producer, who is to
be allowed to start again on the old basis as soon as
he is ready.
(4) Lack of any assurance that the loan disease
won’t resume when the sky is blue again, and upset
all calculations. A £10,000,000 loan, dumped sud-
denly on a small community, may make such a
change in conditions as to upset everything.
* * * *
In Britain (the British Isles don’t borrow
money abroad) even the most virulent Free-
trader is dropping to proposition No. 3.
Britain depends mostly on Germany for
dye-stuffs. It can’t get them now. It
doesn’t want to go wholly undyed. Yet it
recognises that it can’t expect British
manufacturers to take on the industry
at great outlay* if the German competition
which killed their business before is to start
again as soon as an impoverished and extra-
cheap-labor Fatherland resumes honest work.
So that embittered Freetrader, Sir Albert
Spicer, proposes a heavy duty on aniline
dyes, with a cast-iron proviso that it Won't
be reduced for at least 10 years after the
end of the war. By that time, probably, all
idea of reduction will have passed out of
the British mind. The Bulletin doesn’t
like Albert’s title, which is poor and shoddy.
It regards his Christian name as Germanic
and his surname as tawdry and smelling of
groceries. But he has grasped a situation
which has eluded _ the boom-and-burst
politicians of Australia.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Some Mixed Tariff Propositions.
“Henry Horsecollar” writes: —
The unemployed deputation which wants the Gov-
ernment to supply it with work, and the high-price-
of-meat deputation which wants the cost of the chop
reduced, and the deputation of workmen who desire
higher wages, and the deputation of manufacturers
who want the duty on imported machinery dimin-
ished are becoming too greatly mixed.
One day last week the unemployed deputation arose
in Melbourne, and spoke harsh words to a Minister.
And the Minister, being a creature who depends on
the breath of popular favor, spoke soft words in
reply. If he had been a coarse, brutal Minister he
would have told the deputation that so long as it
wanted 100 per cent, more wages than the European
rate while it wouldn’t raise the tariff more than 30
per cent., and so long as it believed in importing
goods instead of manufacturing them, it must expect
to be short of work.
It ought to have been explained to the high-price-
of-meat deputation that if the country will import
immense quantities of ironware and clothes and boots
instead of making them here, and thus insists on
creating lack of employment, it must export meat
and wheat to pay for the goods, even if the resulting
scarcity makes the loaf and chop almost unattainable.
! A deputation of printers, who waited on the Fed-
eral Minister of Customs to ask for a reduction of
the duty on United States printing machinery, ought
to have been told (but wasn’t) that it would be better
. for half the press of Australia to close up rather than
that posterity should be pawned to pay for the appli-
ances which record the record turnip and the unex-
pected death of the oldest local inhabitant at the age
of 106 after a long illness.
And to the deputation which asked for more remu-
neration it ought to have been mentioned (but
wasn’t) that in a country which lives honestly, and
•doesn’t put posterity up the spout to the foreign
Private Enterprise capitalist, wages are limited by
the value of the goods produced, and a community
which enjoys adult suffrage, having all the machinery
of State in its own hands, must work out its own
salvation.
Incidentally, it is mentioned that David G. Stead,
of the N. S. Wales Fisheries Department, has com-
pleted the purchase of three trawlers (200 tons each)
in England. Apart from the fact that they may sink
on the way out, that means 600 tons less local em-
ployment, and 600 tons more people out of work, and
600 tons more imported shipping for the out-of-works
to pay for. If a large deputation, armed with a
club, and a cannon, and a howitzer, and an aero-
plane, and a Zeppelin, and a bull dog, and a bottle
of poison, and an infuriated mother-in-law, and a
superb stock of bad language, also a Slang dictionary
and a devil, had called on the Cabinet about this
matter, it would have been much better than asking
for more loans and more unprofitable public works.
♦
The Inevitable Ke-avvakening of the
Colored Labor Question.
A recent yarn in a Sydney evening paper
—the sort of yarn that was bound to happen
in the present war-time —set forth that
“Indians Ask for Justice” on the ground
that they are “Fighting Our Fight.” In
other words, the writer, Abdul Somebody,
demanded that, because of the Prussian
Murderer’s disturbance, our colored brother
and fellow-soldier should in future be freely
admitted to Australia. It is a pity that
military and imperial affairs should be
mixed up with racial concerns in this fas-
hion, yet it is certain that there will be a
recrudescence of the cheap colored labor
doctrine in Australia before the war is Over.
Because Gunga Sikh and Ram Giioorka
are valiant comrades there will be a tempo-
rary inclination to look upon them kindly
as Australian citizens. Any fraternal ex-
citement of this sort calls for discourage-
ment. The Roman Catholic Church, which
is very old and very wise, doesn’t make any-
body a saint until his or her character has
stood some centuries of inspection, and in
like manner no new person should be made
a friend and brother except after lon© and
profound thought. The Indian is lighting
our battles, and fighting them well. luciden-
tally we are fighting his battles, and we
have, in proportion to population, put up
a stronger force than India has done. If
our men haven’t got to the front it was no
fault of theirs; and, anyhow, we have per-
formed some scraps of naval service
which should make the account square.
We destroyed the ship which bombarded
Madras, while no Hindu destroyed any ship
which bombarded Melbourne or Adelaide.
The Indian has gone to war at better
wages than he could have got at home, and
the Australian has gone at worse wages.
There is no obligation on either side, and
the racial question remains just where it
was. Australia keeps out the Indian to
some extent by a language test. India keeps
out the Australian by the much more effec-
tive process of underselling him. _ His is a
wages test. In 1911 the non-British white
population of India (the British white popu-
lation being mostly the army)—that is to
say Portuguese, Spanish, French, Dutch,
Belgian, German, Swiss, Italian, Greek,
Danish, Norwegian, Swedish, Russian,
Canadian, United States, Mexican, Cen-
tral American, South American, Maori-
landers, Australians and some sundries
—was 13,076. At the same time the
British Indians in Australia alone
numbered 6644, and there were quite a num-
ber from native States. In Natal, which is
only one small province of: South Africa,
the Indians number over 100,000; and in
Fiji they amount to more than 40,000. It
is difficult to see that our Indian fellow-
imperialist has any ground of complaint.
His low-wage system is a much better pro-
tection against the admixture of races than
the Australian education test. If all bar-
riers were lifted there would probably he, at
very short notice, 4,000,000 Indians in Aus-
tralia, and about 100 Australians in India.
And because this country has adult suffrage
the Indian would presently govern the Coun-
try, while in his own land, there being no
suffrage of any kind, he doesn’t even govern
himself, nor does the British person profess
to regard him as qualified for the job. Look-
ing at the matter without any sudden appen-
dicitis or other symptoms, the position may
be defined thus: Our Indian fellow-subject
is a valiant soldier —an even better soldier
than he was supposed to be; and the exist-
ing order of things should be left in the old
place.
A Kink in the Law.
“W.8.D.” on giving the man a chance: —
One of the few sound things the Holman Govern-
ment ever did was the introduction of the Criminal
Appeal Act. It was in all material particulars a copy
of the Criminal Appeal Act of the Asquith Govern-
ment. And yet, owing to a clause in the N. S. Wales
Crimes Act, nearly every conviction which is
obtained in this State would be quashed under the
English appeal system.
Under the old English law of criminal evidence—
the law at the root of the Act which Holman copied
—the rule is rigid. Subject to two conditions only
may evidence be given of the previous convictions of
a prisoner—(1) if he has advanced his own character
as good ; (2) if he has advanced the character of any
witness for the prosecution as bad. If the prisoner
abstains from doing both, no English jury is allowed
to hear of his previous record ; and if by an accident
it does hear —as not infrequently happens —and a con-
viction ensues, it is quashed. The Court will quash
a conviction on the ground that “any substantial mis-
carriage of justice” has occurred, and the one thing
which is regarded above all others as a “substantial
miscarriage” is the disclosure of the prisoner’s pre-
vious record to the jury.
In N. S. Wales such evidence is admissible at the
discretion of the Judge. This puts in the hands of
one man the power, practically, to destroy the
accused at will. If a Judge happens to consider
that the case for the prosecution is weak, while in
his opinion the prisoner is guilty, all he has to o
to swing the balance against the latter is to u^ 6
his prerogative. A bad record may mean guilt. On
the other hand, it may be the very reason—or the
chief one —why the accused is in the dock. lh
police being what they are, previous guilt may be as
good a reason for his arrest as the fact that he
committed the crime. But juries don’t look at
things this way. To many a juryman a man who
has once stolen is a thief for life; also, a potential
forger and murderer. For such a man, m such ci
cumstances, trial by jury ceases to exist. in
policeman who arrests him is the jury, Judge
prosecution, all in one. He can never recover from
his first fall, which is only another way of saying
that one of the main aims of modern criminology
de An te abuse which is only occasional elsewhere is
therefore chronic in N. S. Wales. Every day, during
the criminal sessions, carefully constructe
as soon as they begin to look like succeeding, art
May.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I cannot tell when the war will end, but I know it
is going to begin in May.— Kitchener.
The Lord knoweth when it will end !
Conjecture reeleth at the thought of its con-
clusion ;
Hope fainteth for the dream of its termina-
tion ; ...
Reason jumpeth upon her hat in considering
the possibilities of its finish.
But the war will begin in May !
In Poland was there a drum beaten,
Or a bugle blown upon the midnight,
In the darkness,
Beside the cold rivers;
And, 10, in the morning the housemaid
mopped up the blood of 30.000.
But the war will begin in May !
In Flanders was there a splashing heard,
A loud splashing in the black mud;
And the cannon roared mightily
Till Winter was shaken upon his throne
Through the exceeding heat of the noise.
And the trains went to and fro
In France and in Belgium ;
And the dead of the nations,
Packed in the carriages as the corpses of
mutton are packed in frost,
They whom the sword had devoured,
They whom the cannon had smitten,
Were more than the Cologne Gazette would
mention
Or the London Times compute.
But the war will begin in May!
Consider the peace of the world!
Now, even as I sing to you,
While the butcher yowleth at the door
And the peach ripeneth upon the tree,
A. Servian holdeth an Austrian by the braces
and poketli a hole in his lungs, .
A Montenegrin slayeth another Austrian
with a meat chopper, .
A Russian chaseth seven punctured lurks
across the snow,
A Turco proddeth the stomach of a Bavarian
with a bayonet,
A Sikh danceth around a Saxon smiting
him with the hind end of a rifle,
A Highlander also danceth and maketh a
slogan while Death chortleth in the rage
and whirl of his kilt.
And these things are done seven times a
minute, day and night, continually!
Yea, consider the peace of the world,
For war will begin in May!
Consider the peace of the world !
Several millions of people to-night have no
homes.
Several millions of people have less food
than the prodigal son in a far country.
Several millions of the several millions are
probably young children.
Several millions of cwt. of hardware are
daily hurled through the air.
Several millions of peaceful citizens have not
the slightest idea when a piece of the
hardware will fall upon them.
But consider the peace of the world,
For war will begin in May!
Yea, consider the peace of the world some
more!
Every Englishman desireth to slay every
German and to hurt exceedingly every
Austrian and Turk.
Every Frenchman desireth to slay every

Every Russian desireth to do what every
Englishman would do and to do it hard.
Every Belgian desireth to walk on the top

Every Servian and Montenegrin desireth. to

Every Turk desireth to kill something, but

Every Prussian desireth to slay, after he

Every other sort of German goeth along with
the Prussian because his boots are large

Africanders. Pathans, Sikhs, Egyptians,

they desire and doing it now.
Wherefore consider the peace of the world.
And remember that WAR will begin in May.
Let us be humbly thankful for the time that
is yet left us,
For men shall say in after time:
“There was a little battle practice in Bel-
gium,
A picnic of the nations at the Yser.
An affair of outposts on the Vistula,
A small snowballing in Armenia,
A testing of guns at. the Aisne,
But the war began in May.
Let us look matters in the face.
Let us clench our whiskers.
Let us accumulate kerosene tins to make a
defensive armor for the front gate.
Let us cork up our souls with determination
And sharpen our boots as with fire,
For a considerable scrap, almost amounting
to a controversy, is about to take place,
And the date of the commencement of the
argument is officially fixed for May.

wrecked by the caprice or prejudice of Judges.
Prisoners are downed, not on the evidence, but
because they have been down before. Convictions
innumerable are obtained which, under that part of
the British system which the Holman Government
omitted to copy, would have been instantly quashed
as involving a “substantial miscarriage of justice.”
It is all wrong.

How Lazarus Rose Again and How
Pilate Washed His Hands.
Last week Lazarus rose from the grave in
Sydney just when he was least expected,
(lie has since gone back to the grave, also
he has come out again, for he is a
most hazy and shifty Lazarus.) In
other words, the State Premier announced
that the Norton-Griffiths agreement is
alive once more. The idea is to hand over
the railway-building industry of New South
Wales to Private Enterprise—not Australian
Private Enterprise, but the British article.
Also Private Enterprise is to find the money
by loan—£lo,ooo,ooo of it altogether, spread
over several years. The scheme may fall
down dead some more, but the Min-
istry is so enamored of it that it
evidently won’t die any oftener than can
be helped. The English firm of Private
Enterprise is i<- receive 5 per cent, commis-
sion on the cost of the work done, which
means that the job which would cost the
State 20s. under the old day-labor system
and Government supervision will now cost
21s. That is to say, it must cost the extra
shilling unless railway building has lately
been done at a needlessly high price, which
might happen if the idea was not so much
to build railways as to find billets for poli-
tical supporters . or possible supporters.
Possibly the merits of the Norton-Griffiths
idea are (1) that the firm can drive its
employees harder than the State did; (2)
that it can sack them when and how
it pleases; (3) that it can explain
to them cheerfully that it isn’t to
be coerced by threats of the with-
drawal of political support, because it
isn’t in politics; and (4) that the Cabinet,
when appealed to, can say that it is very
sorry, but it has no power to interfere. In
other words Pilate will be able to wash his
hands. He will also be able to wash
Lazarus. In that case the extra Is. in the £
ma.v be a profit rather than a loss, but the
business, looks like an unkind reflection by
the Government on its own management of
the day-labor system. How a private firm
will be able to raise the millions required
on the credit of N.S.W. at better terms than
N.S.W. could command if it did its own job,
especially now when the raising of new
loans in Britain, except by special permis-
sion of the Qovernment, is strictly pro-
hibited, it is difficult to say. It is even
difficult to imagine how Private Enterprise
can raise the millions just new on any terms.
But if it has to hang up operations by reason
of financial stringency, the rulers of the
State will at least be able to point out that
it was Private, and not Public, Enterprise
which failed to make good. Thus Pilate
will again wash his hands —or perhaps his
head, or maybe his feet. Private or Con-
tract Enterprise, or whatever it may be
called, is to commence work on a large scale
just when the services on the existing lines
are being greatly cut down on the plea that
the position isn’t payable. Its biggest effort
(according to one Minister, though another
one casts doubt on the statement) is
to be the construction of 373 miles of track
across a dry and very unpeopled section of
the State?, in order to connect Condobolin
with Broken Hill—neither of which places
is doing- very well just now. Viewed from
all points, the lumbering device looks more
like an effort to shift the blame on to some-
one else at 5 per cent, than to shift dirt in
large construction works. But it may be
that, inside another week or so, the whole
proposition mav have died and resurrected
so often, and taken so many new shapes, that
much pf the above comment will be wasted.
The Top-hat Reformer.
An Australian Judge made an astonishing
pronouncement the other day—astonishing
bv reason of its evidence of a lack of a sense
of proportion. He spoke of the constant
use of the word “awfully,” “terrible,” etc.
“It might probably be accounted for,” he
said, “through the prurient, unhealthy
literature which, though obtainable in some
of the best shops, was a disgrace to the
writers and to the readers.” As a Judge
of the Supreme Court he knew that many
“traced their downfall to this class of un-
healthy literature. He would like to see it
checked, and if he could do anything to
prevent it he would consider that he had not
lived his life in vain.” A Supreme Court
Judge has a good deal of honor in his own
State. His word goes. If he started a
social campaign of any sort he would be 10
times likelier to bring it to a successful
conclusion than the next man. Picture the
effect, for example, if the Chief Justice of
Victoria, or of N. S. Wales, made the extir-
pation of venereal disease one of his life’s
hobbies. The apathetic section of the
public would be awakened ; the genteel press
would begin to feel that the subject was
mentionable, after all; the politicians hang-
ing, dog-like, on the whims of their masters
would be stirred to action. We all know
the “power for evil” of such “unhealthy”
literature as the bookshops of the Common-
wealth retail. Partly because the police
are vigilant, partly because the national
taste does not run in the direction of literary
obscenities, there is hardly enough printed
naughtiness sold in a year to fill a toy book-
case. Not so with venereal disease. There
is enough of that sold, ceaselessly, all over
the Commonwealth, to half fill our asylums,
to ruin the peace of innumerable homes; to
destroy the lives of thousands of innocent
children; to help populate our gaols; to
make the continent’s dwindling black race
loathsome; and, by reducing the national
vitality, to vastly limit the country’s earn-
ing powers. And it is nobody’s business to
apply an effective check. The Judge who is
shocked that people say “terribly” instead
of “very” has met so many whose downfall
is traceable to gushing adjectives that he
would do anything to check their circula-
tion. But what about the cohorts that
have passed before him whose members owe
their downfall to syphilis? Will he claim
that the latter army does not outnumber the
former by a hundred to one? And if so, why
waste time on the tiny problem when there
is a mighty one waiting to be tackled? The
respectability fetich is the explanation. One
of the first things the average Supreme Court
Judge does on appointment is to buy himself
a new top-hat and frock- coat.. He never
takes the garments off till he. dies. He will
use his considerable social influence along
conventional lines —that is to say, he is
always available to deplore the drink evil,
or to orate on the beneficial effects, of regular
church-going—but further he declines to go.
What Australia wants badly is a high
official with the nerve to leave the beaten
track of Reform —one who is prepared, in
the cause of suffering humanity, to figura-
tively kick the inside out of his silk hat and
cast his frock-suiting into the dust-bin.
New Ports and Old Superstitions.
Minister Griffith of N.S.W. had an
uprising in his mind the other day. He
regarded it as a haggard and ungrateful sort
of business that the people of the North
Coast should talk of secession, and allege
that the outlying ports of the State are
neglected. By way of evidence he recited
at length the amounts of loan, money which
had been spent on. the outlying ports, and
the figures were quite imposing. Unfortu-
nately most of the money has been spent,
as a matter of set purpose, on the hopeless
spots. Places like Port Stephens and Jervis
Bay and Twofold Bay, which are deep-water
inlets and capable of competing with Sydney
for oversea trade, can’t get a railway, or a
decent wharf, or even a respectable road.
But the farce of decentralisation has to be
kept up, so when the Government finds an
impossible river mouth, which, even by the
expenditure of £500,000, can Qnlyybe made an
entrance and exit for little vessels which will
carry goods for transhipment at Sydney, the
coin is gaily expended on that absurd river
mouth. The bar keeps shifting, and the
breakwater keeps falling to pieces, and the
little vessels are constantly being bogged,
and the district makes no progress, and the
oldest inhabitant explains persistently over
his threepenny beer how the whole affair was
muddled and mixed. A vast amount of good
legal tender is sunk outside perished towns,
which will never be seaports between now
and the day of the general Resurrection.
Open roadsteads like Port Kembla are
boomed,- while real harbors like Jervis Bay
remain dead. Bxcited politicians declare
that some place like Merimbula, where a pig
can be loaded in calm weather, is the natural
outlet of the N.S.W. South Coast, while
Twofold Bay doesn’t receive even a cruet-
stand as a birthday present. The Conges-
tion policy and the One-Big-City policy
demand these sacrifices. The utter and
hopeless curse of any N.S.W. sea outlet,
apart from Sydney, is to be a good sea-outlet
which might possibly compete with Sydney.

Wheat for Maoriland.
After much debate with the Australian
Department of Trade and Customs, the
N.S.W. Government got permission to export
100.000 bushels of wheat to Maorilar-d. The
goods were not despatched until the ship had
been held up for .five days and had cost £250
in demurrage. Nobody has any legal right
to object to anybody trading with Maoriland
under ordinary conditions', but this was a
special case. The N.S.W. Government
seized the local wheat at ss. per bushel. It
stopped the sale of N.S.W: wheat in Vic-
toria, which looked very much like a breach
of the Australian law providing for absolute
freedom of sale and purchase inside the
Commonwealth. The right of Holman and
co. to annex the wheat of the Ma State and
to stop dealings in grain yyith an adjacent
State was sub judice, therefore it was
uncertain whether it legally owned the pro-
duce which it proposed to send out of the
Commonwealth. Still Holman and co. were
moved to great anguish by the fact that the
crop in Maoriland (outside the Common-
wealth) is short, though it didn’t anguish
in the least because - the crop of Victoria
(inside the Commonwealth) is much shorter.
It cancelled, as a matter of doubtful legality,
existing contracts for the sale of wheat at a
high price to a sister State, and sooled its
border bobby on to seize the drays and the
contents thereof. Yet it almost burst its
boiler in the struggle to supply an outside
Dominion with which no contracts existed,
and to supply it on easier terms. Four pos-
sible explanations of all this superfluous and
unprofitable and unpatriotic fuss suggest
themselves: (1) That the Holman crowd
has always been anti-Federal; (2) that
trade with Maoriland goes through Sydney,
which, in its view, is the whole State and
the dog under the waggon, while trade with
Victoria goes through Albury and other
country towns; (3) that oversea trade
anpears in the statistics to the glorification
of the Ma State, while inland trade doesn’t;
(4) pure muddle and a tendency to do the
busybody act. Probably No. 2 wins by a
head, with No. 4 close up.

Public Cash for Private Litigation.
A legal view of the matter: — '
The Melbourne Board of Works is requesting State
Premier Peacock to “bring-before Cabinet the ques-
tion of amending the law of libel so that legal pro-
ceedings may be taken by corporations against news-
papers which publish slanders against them.’’ The
merely technical fact that spell publications could not
be “slanders” is only of interest in so far as it illus-
trates the exhaustive ignorance of the Board in rela-
tion to the whole subject. The alteration in the law
which it invites would, if effected, amount to ah in-
version of the spirit and the settled wisdom of
Courts ever since companies and corporations were
first invented, and it would also be subversive of
common-sense. The Law regards a corporation as an
entity in itself, and pays no regard to the individuals
composing it. Lord Robson —a recent Attorney-
General of England—put it that such a body “cannot
bring an action in respect of a statement concerning
it unless the statement relates to its business. It has
no feelings which can be hurt or irritated; and it
has no moral character which can be defamed.” The
individuals composing it may be individually “hurt
or irritated,” but if so they must pay for their
remedies out of their own pockets. They are no
more entitled to call upon the corporation than they
are to call on the Zoological Society or the Baptists’
Union, or any other entity. Morally, they are least
of all entitled to call upon the corporation, because
they are, incidentally, trustees of its funds. It has
been made clear by one after another of the greatest
Judges that pretensions 6uch as those put forward
by this Victorian corporation must be destroyed.
Chief Baron Pollock laid it down that a corporation
“could not sue in respect of an imputation of mur-
der, or incest, or adultery, because it could not com-
mit those crimes ; nor could it sue in respect of a
charge of corruption, though the individuals com-
posing it may. But it may maintain an action
for a libel by which its property is injured.” In
affirming this view nearly half a century later Lord
Esher, Master iqf the Rolls and one of the greatest
of modern lawyers, said that “it might be stated of
a person that his manners were contrary to all sense
of decency or comityr and such that, if the state-
ments were true, they would render him deserving in
the minds of persons of ordinary sense of contempt,
hatred or ridicule; but if the same thing were said
with regard to a corporation, it would be impossible
that it should have the same effect, because a corpora-
tion, as such, cannot have indecent or vulgar man-
ners.” The very reasonable and common-sense cir-
cumstances under which a corporation may sue,, and
the only circumstances under which it may sue, are
defined by Lord Justice Lopes, another of the very
greatest of modern lawyers. He says that “the words
complained of, in order to entitle a corporation to
sue for libel, must injuriously affect the corporation
as distinct from the individuals who compose it. A !
corporation could not sue in respect of a charge of
corruption or of an assault, because a corporation
cannot be guilty of corruption or of an assault,
although the individuals composing it may be. The
words complained of must attack the corporation in
the method of conducting its affairs.” Otherwise
no action will lie. Many more judgments might be
quoted, and the design of all of them is to prevent
that very consummation which the members of the
Melbourne Board of Works are desirous of bringing
about, and so to avoid a squandering of the public
money in the prosecution of personal actions. As is
said by Blake Odgers, the great authority on libel:
“If the officers of any corporation be libelled, and
take either civil or criminal proceedings to clear
themselves, the costs must not be paid out of the
corporate funds, which were contributed for other
purposes.” He illustrates the point by the case of
the Attorney-General v. Compton. In this case a
Turkish railway co. was managed by English direc-
tors. One Ellissen wrote to Lord Stanley (then
Secretary for Foreign Affairs) charging the .directors
with mismanaging the affairs of the company and
misappropriating its funds. At a general meeting of
the shareholders a resolution was passed requesting
the directors “to adopt the strongest possible
measures to put an end to such mischievous action.”
The directors accordingly prosecuted Ellissen for
libel, but the Vice-Chancellor ,held that the costs of
such prosecution could not bh paid out of -the assets
of the company, and in such a case the directors
would be ordered to repay to the company any costs
thus improperly paid out of its funds. The position
of the Board of Works is thus as obvious as it is
equitable. It has to supply water to Melbourne. If
anyone damages its business by declaring that it sup-
plies bad water, or that it supplies good
water badly, it might have an action. But
neither in law nor in common-sense can this remedy
be held to extend to the individuals composing it. If
these have personal grievances to air they must take
them for an airing at their personal expense. The
Board was never intended to be a protecting British
Lion. It was only intended to supply water.
The Doctor, the Judge and’ the
Penwoman.
Melbourne’s penwomen, social-reformers
and militants, all of whom are more likely
to suffer from a motor-car accident than to
cause it, might very well take up the griev-
ance of Miss Helen Davis. Helen Davis
is favorably known as a penwoman who has
written of factory life from personal experi-
ence, and has interested herself in the
organisation of working-girls’ clubs and
other things that bring more credit than
profit to enthusiasts of her type. One even-
ing, some months ago, she was caught in
the rain whilst walking homewards, and went
to a friend’s place for shelter. She stayed
there a couple of hours, had some coffee, and
then went forth into the same old rain to
catch a tram. As she was leaving'the path
to hail the car, a motor containing a medical
man and his family party (they were re-
turning from a wedding) knocked the lady
down and gave her what has proved to be
a very serious shock to the nervous system.
For a time Miss Davis had no further
grievance against the medico. He drove her
home and dressed a wound on her head
before taking her to another practitioner.
He gave her £3 a week for two weeks, and
by his own admission gotjso near to talking
about “fair compensation” that the lady said
“it is for you to make a"»proposition.” But
later on he said: “You know the accident
would not have occurred if you had not been
drunk,” whereupon the indignant patient
broke off friendly relations and ’ sued the
motorist. Judge Eagleson heard the case;
and his attitude is well enough suggested
by one incident. When the nervous plain-
tiff came to the point where the defendant
accused her of being drunk, she sobbed;
whereupon the learned Judge exclaimed: “I
will not have this theatrical display!” and
when the witness’s counsel protested, his
Honor suppressed him. Thus, with witnesses
flatly contradicting one another, the jury
could not well escape being swayed against
the woman ; and that no doubt let in to the
jury’s mind the suggestion that, perhaps,
after all, she had had a drink, though her
evidence went to show that it was impos-
sible. Whether Miss Davis could recover
the damages that she has-so-far failed to
get is not now the questionthe injus-
tice she is under is that> besides' having to
suffer unrecompensed physical injuries, she
has now to put up with mental sufferings
because of the mud thrown at her character
—a more serious matter in her case than in
most others even, in view of her position
in social reform matters. The matter is
distinctly one which should be re-opened—
if, indeed, it be only to satisfy , the public of
the righteousness of Judge EaglESOn’s atti-
tude towards the woman-of-little-consequence
on the one side and of the socially-superior
motorist on the other.

Among the bricks heaved at the Fisher
Government’s new tariff a specially weighty
one was propelled by the Vic. Rope and
Cordage Employees’ Union. This body wants
a fixed duty, plus an additional 50 per cent.
ad valorem, on all cordages, twines, mats,
coir and jute yarns imported, and asserts
that the 35 and 30 per cent, rate just fixed
is merely fooling with the proposition. The
trouble with this industry is that it has to
compete with the cheap labor of Asia, where
the worker toils for a week of 70 hours for
from, 3s. 6d. to 4s. 6d. In 1913 Australia
imported cordages, twines, etc., to the value
of £1,236,685. ‘ Considering the difference in
wages and the fact that the previous tariff
was 25 and 30 per cent., this was no more
than might have been expected. Now,
there is no pretence that Australia cannot
make rope, twines, etc.; and the FisnEß
Government would promptly stop these
foreign factory hands as undesirable immi-
grants if they tried to enter the country; yet
it professes to protect the white Australian
worker against the cheap colored alien by
raising the duty from 30 to 35 per cent.

gave to the Belgians was hardly more

The Dream of All the Ages.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Beyond my bedroom window,
Garret and gable-end,
Ugly and mean and grimy,
The city roofs extend.
As one who from bis turret
Captive in prison laid
Beholds his foe’s encampment,
I view the Tents of Trade.
All day her countless legions
Flow down the dusty ways,
White-faced and worn and eager,
Or dull of heart and gaze,
Mocked by an idle vision,
Lured by a bitter lie,
They wage their drear queen’s battle
For ever till they die.
Against night’s starry purple
She monstrously unrolL",
In token of her triumph,
Her flaming banneroles;
Emerald, gold, vermilion —
Their garishness proclaims
The summit of her splendor,
The symbol of our shames.
Oh, heart so utter-weary !
Beyond the houses’ rim,
Crimson and huge and magic,
- The moon is rising dim ;
And whispering to the night-wind
I hear the little stream
Beyond the hills of faery,
In quiet woods of dream.
Warm winds and murmuring waters,
And yellow, furry bees,
They make a sighing music
, About the apple-trees.
And, oh, the red, red apples
That mellow in the sun,
Where all the tales are ended,
And all the dreams begun !
Here, where the dust-cloud hovers
Above the shrieking quays,
She-oak and gum and wattle
Swayed lonely to the breeze;
And from the city steeples
1 The warning bells speak plain
That what the dust has builded
To dust shall fall again.
The winds that drave the tunny
Before the fleets of Tyre
Brought fair and costly fuel
To heap her funeral pyre ;
And where an empire’s commerce
Once bound Byzant to Gaul,
Rode Goth and Hun and Arab
To make an end of all.
Each unto each allotted
Their little span of days,
The pageant of the nations
Moves down Time’s shadowy ways.
Egypt or Rome or England—
The greatness that they planned
Shall be no more enduring
Than writing upon sand.
(Down where the streamlet murmurs,
Green moss and maidenhair
Mirror a fragile beauty
They had not dreamed so fair.
And, oh, the river meadows
Where happy lovers stray,
And pluck the crimson poppies
That gleam beside the way!)
Doomed dust of long-dead empires,
Drift of the drifting years,
The burden of our fathers
We buy with blood and tears.
From London to Atlantis
With fruitless dreams fulfilled,
We raise the arch of progress
That crumbles as we build.
Till through the stellar darkness,
Blind, sluggish and fore-done,
A dying planet staggers
About a lurid sun.
The passion of our striving,
Ages on ages through,
Is but a dream forgotten
Of gods that dream anew.
(Above the dark-green woodland
Far-stretched on every hand,
White walls and red-roofed castles
O’erlook the Pleasant Land. ,
And e’er the moon-enchanted
Moat turn to silver, fire,
Beneath the castle shadow
I hold my heart’s desire.)
Through my uncurtained window
The solemn stars recall
About the moon, their priestess,
Their old recessional,
Far in the eastern heaven
Little by little grows
A grey from out the purple,
Out of the grey a rose.
New-risen from the stillness,
Mysteriously borne
On wings of shadowy music
Floats up the cool-eyed dawn:
And like a tide new-swollen
To wage its ancient war
With earth in wrath-white thunders,
The city wakes once more.

The War and the Bitter Frost.
The war approaches the close of its first
half-year. The struggle to keep warm has
slackened the ardor of things, but everybo y
expects to wake up like a butterfly in March,
and shoot like the very Devil. Still things
move a little, and a good many thousand
men are sometimes killed or wounded in a
day. The Kaiser’s one recent streak of lucky
when 10,000 Frenchmen were cut off by
floods near Soissons and had to hold up
their end against 40,000 Prussians, hasn
been repeated. Another of his stupendous
and spasmodic efforts to break through to
Calais has been in progress for

points. The great army with which it tried
to invade Southern Russia, after being
wrecked in three battles, seems now to be a
mere ruck of fugitives, with the Bear run-
ning behind ,it on the snow. It may get
reinforcements and do a big rafiy, for the
Turk lasts long, but apparently the rally
won’t take place until it gets to the low-

too active in hanging those who disapprove
of his methods and his . failures. Ihe
Teuton’s capacity for acquiring unpopularity
follows him everywhere. Some folk are even
remarking in whispers that Abdul the
Damned wasn’t such a bad old fiend alter
a ll —by comparison. Which recalls a remark
made to the writer by a European hotel-
keeper at Nablous (Palestine) when the
Young Turk was in all the glory ot his
reformation: “We used to have one tyrant
and now we have 24.” The promised
German invasion of Servia, where the Aus-
trians failed so badly, is still expected, but
it hasn’t yet arrived. It is one of the frozen
spectres of the hour. Italy doesnt move,
but always ,thinks of joining the Allies. Its
problem seems to be : What. is the least
amount of assistance it can give while, still
preserving its claim to the Italian provinces
ot Austria when that vast, disjointed point
is cut up? The position of Roumania is
curious. It has a very fine army, which it
carefully mobilised. Then it carefully did
nothing, yet it admittedly expects to get the
Roumanian districts of Austria. Last week
two things happened. A Russian army
fought its way through Austria almost to
the Roumanian border, which was . a very
strenuous invitation to the old Latin king-
dom to wake up. And the Kaiser either
w T ent mad; or else he. . thought that if
Roumania was going to join his enemies it
might as well come in while the snow is
heavy and the roads difficult, and. enjoy all
the misery that is coming, to it, instead of
beginning its campaign in the pleasant
spring-time. Anyhow Berlin served some-i
thing .very like an ultimatum on Bucharest.
The Kaiser’s airships have again raided
England, and bombed some undefended
towns, and killed a few harmless people,
including a shoemaker named Smith. In
return the British badly damaged two Ger-
man cruisers in the North Sea and sank a
third —the Blucher, named after the Prus-
sian general who remarked that London
would he a fine city to sack. The ex-Khedive
of Egypt, who lost his comfortable throne
at Cairo by joining the Turks and Germans,
has apparently been run out of Turkey by
the slack of his fez as a useless encumbrance.
Anyhow he was last heard of in Switzer-
land looking for hotel accommodation, and
posing as an example of lamentable in-
gratitude. Incidentally, the Kaiser has
appointed a friend of his —one of the Aus-
trian family of Windisciigratz —as King of
Belgium. He may possibly nominate a new
king of Great Britain and Ireland next
week, and then London will be expected to
do a hurrah for its new monarch.
From a Sydney Telegraph leader of
26/l/’l5, being a completely fresh view of
the case:—
All roads lead to Rome, and under the centralis-
ing POLICY OP THE COUNTRY DISTRICTS, which insist
on communication with the city, and will be satisfied
with access to no other seaport, all our railways
lead to Sydney.
In other words, the heretic was only burned
because he insisted on it. The clamor of
Western Riverina to have its railways con-
nected with Melbourne has been loud and
incessant. Also Riverina has run quite a
number of separation movements because it
was tired of the interminable road to Syd-
ney and the cost thereof. The movements
failed because the Sydney centralisation
policy has left these districts almost empty,
and there aren’t enough people to start
the necessary insurrection. Only the other
day Grafton inaugurated a feeble little sepa-
ration movement —feeble because the policy
of dragging all population into the County
of Cumberalnd makes it difficult for the
depopulated counties to find enough folk to
create a live agitation. Yet such people as
remain are quite annoyed at the policy,
dictated by Sydney interests, which takes
the North Coast railway round in an absurd
and costly semi-circle lest it should connect
with Port Stephens, and thus supply a handy
outlet for deep-sea commerce. Further north
the settlers have been uncivil for years be-
cause of a carefully-preserved gap in the
railway line which prevents them using
Brisbane as an outlet. It is an evidence of
the Sydney Telegraph’s lack of humor that
the article in which the above remark
appeared was entitled “Country Killing.”
It was meant to be a mere commercial stodge
about the advisability of murdering the bul-
lock in the country and sending the corpse
instead of the live animal to Sydney. But
it should have been called “Killing the
Country.”
♦
A successful protest has at last been made
against the ridiculous press censorship which
prevails in Australia. A Perth paper had
printed some remarks made by an incoming
passenger concerning what he saw in the
Suez Canal and elsewhere on the voyage.
Though everybody else on board could have
seen the same things, and though they were
in any case a month old when they were
printed, the authorities prosecuted the paper
for publishing information likely to be
directly or indirectly of use to the enemy.
The magistrate saw how ludicrous the whole
claim was, and not only dismissed the infor-
mation bqt gave costs against the Depart-
ment. Yet the proceedings in Westralia
were not so fatuous as those of which the
Censor’s office in Sydney has repeatedly been
guilty. This week, for instance, a contribu-
tor, in order to show the untrustworthiness
of United States press reports, _ mentioned
that he had seen a certain British cruiser
at Colombo, and had talked with its officers
at the time when the U.S. papers alleged
that it was beached and helpless in another
part of Asia. The Censor refused permis-
sion to mention the name of the vessel.
Four months ago, when American papers
said the So-and-so was beached, a contribu-
tor saw the ship floating in one of the most-
frequented harbors of Asia; and the Censor
in Sydney will not allow The Bulletin to
say so, lest it might give valuable informa-
tion to the enemy ! This kind of thing is
occurring every week, until, instead of being
welcomed by loyal journals as a help to an
end which they desire as much as anybody,
the Censorship has come to be regarded with
good-natured contempt. This, is true of
every newspaper office of which The
Bulletin has any knowledge. Does
the Minister for Defence think it well for
the country that the Press should entertain
this opinion about an important bfanch ot
his department? Is it likely, for example,
to produce that confidence and optimism of
which he has lately urged the cultivation?
When your luck is out in battle every-
thing. depends on speed. The other day five
British ships met four German ones in
the North Sea, and the Germans ran. The
slowest ship of the nine was the Blucher,
which did 2i knots per hour less than the
slowest British vessel. With its 26-knot
pace it might as well have been a caterpillar
in such company. So it went down, and all
it could say for itself in its last moments
was that it helped to divert attention while
its comrades got away.
The Homburg resignation gives another
comparatively young Adelaide man a chance
as Attorney-General of S. Aus. H. A. I ar-
sons, son of the particularly eloquent J.
Langdon Parsons, of the last generation,
studied law at Adelaide University at the
same time as Homburg, his predecessor.
He is of the literary type, like his senior
partner Glynn, but a sound lawyer also.
However, with his eloquence and education,
Parliament seems to be his proper sphere.
He has some of the money of the Angas
family—the old original George Fife Angas
was his great-grandfather —and is married
to a daughter of Langdon Bonython, of the
Advertiser.

Julius Knight has partially revived “The
Scarlet Pimpernel” at Sydney Royal, which
theatre nowadays gets a J.C.W. show only
once in a while. Julius, oppressively band-
boxy, lounges carefully as the Knglish
devil-may-care who cared a devil of a lot
for his personal appearance. Irene Browne

her ; finger-tips shall touch the vision she
is married to. Lord only knows what would
happen if Julius were pushed too hard and
fell flat on a partially-swept stage in all
his glory! Miss Browne is highly decora-
tive as usual, but suffers from her old in-
ability to portray deep emotion. VV here
the going is supposed to be heavy she is
just a little more pettish than usual, and
holds her handkerchief before her eyes so
that the audience won’t notice the absence
of tears. Or it may be that her agreement
stipulates dry-eyed weeping; a splendid
vision like J. Knight might be seriously
dimmed by a damp heroine. Leslie Victor,
in his old sinister part of Chauvelin, is
perhaps the most satisfactory member of
the long cast. Martin Lewis and H. J.
Bentley are two nicely-tailored lieutenants
of Blakeney, the Pimpernel. But they are
colorless, whereas Frank Harvey manages
to pump some life into his figurehead part
of the Prince of Wales. Atholwood wags
a white beard, in a natural old-man way, as
Hempseed, the ancient English rustic; and
Eardley Turner (Brogard) is a convincing-
figure in the middle distance. Emma
Temple bids gracefully for sympathy, as the
fugitive Comtesse de Tournai, while the
smiling Lizette Parkes breaks English
prettily as her daughter. Costumes and
mounting are creditable.

About SfttiO miles of film has been reeled

Beaumont Smith’s gay farce-comedy,
“The Chaperon,” will cease to chap, to-
morrow night, and the Palace (Sydney)
will, on Saturday, scintillate with “The
Glad Eye.” “Seven Little Australians
continue to cheer up the afternoons in the
same theatre. Incidentally, Beaumont Smith
introduced three shows in one day there on
Tuesday—morning and afternoon perform-
ances of Ethel Turner’s play, and “The
Chaperon” at night.
One of the brightest carnival days of 1914
in Sydney was Actors’ Day, when, for the
first time, the profesh appealed for assistance
for its own benevolent fund. The public,
recognising how generous the players are
with their aid in others misfortune, rallied
to the impromptu street shows in the morn-
ing, and in the evening packed the White
City at Rushcutter’s Bay, where every avail-
able actor and actress in Sydney contributed
to a monumental programme. This year
Actors’ Day falls on Saturday, February 6,
and a similar scheme of carnival has been
arranged.

The Sydney Tivoli Follies have
lately done just enough adding and
subtracting to their programme to
provide an hour’s entertainment
sufficiently different from the en-
tertainments of last week and the
week before to satisfy the habitual
Tiv.-goer. J. "W* Rickaby, the
comedian, and violinist Alfredo
continue to be the major attrac-
tions, with the Royal Welsh Glee
Quartette as runners-up. Wright
and Dietrich, the singers, and
Alex. Yakovlenko, the dancer, are
the mainstays of the other half of
the programme.
A Sydney pageant of the week:
The Sydney newsboys, who, according to the S. M.
Herald, make £l2 a week, held their strike pro-
cession on Friday. The Clerk of the Weather favored
the pampered Children of Fortune with a genial sun
and' a gentle breeze. _ .
First came a troop of mounted police, imperiously
cutting a way for the cavalcade. Just behind the
last police-horse’s tail a costly banner of crimson
silk, heavily scented, billowed in the breeze. On it,
worked in heavy gold, were the words ‘‘Do Not See
Us Starve !” After the banner marched a uniformed
brass band of the prize-winning class playing patri-
otic airs ; then a surging serpentine trail of glittering
bell toppers, fine linen, French fashions, motors,
flowers, sunshades and silk flags. The mere wage-
getters who had been attracted to the line of march
by the magnificent music hissed and howled when
they realised that the overfed capitalists who swag-
gered behind the banner, with cigars stuck in their
faces, were the impostors, who, cleverly disguised
in their gardening clothes, sold evening papers in
the streets. ,
The overdressed wives, who posed in the whirring
motors, paled as one woman, and seized whatever
children they had with them when they realised that
the demonstration which had been intended to
arouse sympathy was only arousing bitter hostility.
Removing the most conspicuous of their jewels, they
hurriedly hid the gems under the motor-cushions.

down in the gutter; whereupon the cry went up:
“Lynch the brutes! They’ve got so much money
that they use lapdogs to knock us down with!”
The temper of the crowd became still more dan-

knocked down by a car while he was screaming in
front of it: “Look at me! I’m a journalist! I
write the papers—and I only get £8 a week!”

Mm aside, and, deftly extracting a dead cat, threw
lit into the lap of an over-dressed female who lounged
•on the cushions. Her scream of disgust was drowned
an the tempestuous roar of laughter that swept the
■street. As the chauffeur angrily threw the thing out
•of the car it was caught and sent whizzing amongst
''the processional belltoppers just ahead, knocking
«aff nine of them.
Instead of marching straight ahead, the arrogant
mews-runners stopped and shouted insults, shaking
their fists and rattling their diamond shirtstuds at
the uproarious crowd. In an instant the procession
was swamped. Plainly-dressed newspaper buyers
swirled round the motors and hustled the belltop-
pered brigade down the street. Occasionally a top-
hat would be snatched off and sent spinning into the
air, only to be caught and tossed again till it dis-
appeared and was trampled underfoot.
A couple of poorly-dressed old men, mumbling
sandwiches out of paper bags, were discovered outside
a pieshop and recognised as two newspaper proprie-
tors. They were instantly shouldered, gifts of meat-
pies, bread, fruit, prawns, fish and money being
pressed upon them until their hands and pockets
were as full as their mouths. Tears of gratitude
poured down their cheeks, and they were so shaken
by sofis that, hungry as they were, they could hardly
eat. The climax was reached when the cheering
crowd bore them to a “ready-made” shop and pur-
chased for cash two complete outfits. While the
gathering was singing “Old Lang Syne” and “Sons

ing tempestuously down the collars of the red-faced
men who were chairing them; the bloated and
despicable news-runners escaped and fled from the
scene on foot and in cabs. Only the more daring
spirits among them appeared in their make-up of
poverty that evening, and the happy public pur-
chased their evening papers as usual at the book-
stalls.

The management at Her Majesty’s
(Melb.) is offering 21 shillings, all told,
for a new chorus verse to the doleful ditty
concerning Sister Susie and the shirts she
sews for soldiers. So this songbird desires
to slip three soulful specimens into the
selection. As follows :
Mary’s making mittens for the soldiers,
And Kate is knitting kneecaps for the Kilties’ chilly
knees;
Those toilers in the trenches would much rather kiss
the wenches
Than the mufflers, mitts, or kneecaps they are send-
ing o’er the seas.
Cis and Sue are sighing sighs for soldiers:
They sadly sit and wonder when the wicked war will
end,
And their simple Cousin Liza cries, “If I could catch
the Kaiser,
I would turn his Nibs face downwards and I’d belt
him on the bend.”
Peg is plain-and-purling pants for Percy,
And Fanny’s fairy fingers fasten frillies down the
seams,
Whilst lots of other charmers manufacture pink
pyjamas,
And pin a note inside them, wishing Percy “pleasant
dreams.”
A lot of people think that the Susie song
doesn’t deserve to have another guinea spent
on it, but nobody knows for certain what
isn’t . worth while in the way of panto,
boosting. One day last week 10,000 citizens
blocked the street where Lupino was “dress-
ing” a hosier’s window, since when the
rush for “Cinderella” has increased in vio-
lence.

“Sinbad the Sailor” continues to hold its
own at Melbourne King’s, and the fact
that one Good Fairy cuts more ice than a
whole kingdom of wicked Demons is still
being impressed upon Melbourne’s youngest
minds. Demons are almost invariably fool-
ish people, . who waste time at trying to
appear terrible. The bounding monsters of
iniquity in the “Sinbad” are no exception to
the rule.
The passing event at Melbourne Princess’s
is a revival of “Brought to Ruin,”
a bellodrama of such colossal imbecility
that even its fondest admirers have to titter
now and then. The heroine is _ lured by
Beckett from a laundry. After living with
him in sin at his comfortable flat she wan-
ders pennilessly forth to starve, with a rag
baby at her breast, merely because lie
declines to marry her in fulfilment of his
vow to a solemn sailor man. Beckett is
really not half so bad as usual. He offers
the flat to the young woman, and a bundle
of paper-money to go on with, but she pre-
fers to go around begging for employment
if she cannot live with him as his Lawful
Wife. Women in bellodrama run in all
shapes. Muriel Starr, at the Royal, thinks
she would rather struggle for a living than
continue to cohabit with an attractive mil-
lionaire because he is her husband, whereas
Gwen Dorise, at the Princess’s, folds up her
rag infant and steals noisily away because
its repellent father objects to matrimony.
Her woe culminates in the choking of her
fraudulent offspring by the lady who runs
the laundry aforementioned ; after which the
misguided young woman is rescued from a
charge of murder, and the serious sailor
claims her for his own. Thus she silences
her vindictive sisters of the wash-tub who
had previously taxed her with disrespecta-
bility. Apart from Beckett and Miss Dorise,
the co. comprises Conway, Kelway, Kirby,
Kehoe, Stanford; Misses Dale, Gresham,
Erris, and others too numerous to mention.
None of them call for as much condemnation
as Mrs. Morton Powell, who actually wrote
“Brought to Ruin.” The same co. will
appear next Saturday (30th) in “At Cripple
Creek,” a more robust drama from Colorado,
with miners and shooters in it.

Robert and Virginia are repeating their
interesting argument at Melbourne Royal.
Whilst they argue on the marriage question
Robert always mentions, incidentally, that
luxury is an insect which eats into the
bones and gnaws the very vitals of its happy
victims. Robert talks oftener and better
than his wife during their animated discus-
sion in the third act of “Bought and Paid
For.” _lt may be because his assertions,
suggestions and actions are wiser than the
lady’s that the performance of Charles
Millward has improved more noticeably than
Miss Starr’s performance. Bob drunk over-
night and Robert sobered-up next morning
are very convincing persons. Also Miss
Davies and W. Harrigan, as the other
married couple, have got fairly hold of their
respective characters, whereas Miss Starr's
character is too fictitious to be realistically
played.

Supported by a lofty young Prince, several
fresh flappers, and considerable inappro-
priate scenery recalling the Egypt of the
Pharaohs, Yestelle, late of the Athenaeum,
gave another exhibition at the Melbourne
Bijou on Saturday night. With her tend-
ency to shortness of breath, the “incomparable
and fascinating actress” merely furnished
the pant in the pantomime, so to speak, while
the aforesaid towering nobleman expressed
his feelings in amorous body-snatching,
and the lady’s alleged fancy warbled
worn endearments in a singular love ballad
of several verses. The audience rightly
applauded the vocal episode, but its opinion
of Yestelle’s guyver was palpably unfavor-
able.

A foreign gentleman who treats a large,
loud piano in a firm, decisive manner, and
who figures on the programme as “the great-
est master of the age,” is the latest person
of importance at Melbourne Tivoli. Mr.
Westony, the apparent foreigner in ques-
tion, is more impressive than some other
trick-pianists ; but his playing of two pieces
with different tunes, or one melody with the
left hand only, is not a musical treat. A
man might as well blow the cornet with a
pair of bellows as play tricks on a piano.
The Randell-Jackson co. gives the same clean
entertainment as before, and Odiva’s pleas-
ing tank act is now followed by amateur
competitive attempts to copy Odiva’s feats.
These are much wetter and more humorous
than. (say) the amateur ragtime song com-
petitions which a painful individual named
Gene Greene exploited on the same stage a
year ago. The writer must apologise for
dragging Greene into the tank, as it were.
He can’t get Gene out of his memory. The
departed ragtimer is his waking nightmare.

“The Lamb, the Woman and the Wolf”
is Hoyt’s most protracted sensation at the
Olympia and National (Melbourne) this
week. Bales of ammunition are exploded in
this film, and the business of slaughter is so
forcibly conducted that the incidental love
theme hardly gets out of its trench. “Of
the Secret Service” is only a trifle less en-
thralling, the bloodhound characteristics of
the leading lady being calculated to make
the Sherlock Holmeses of fiction feel glum
with envy. In a comic vein “The Tale of
a Hat” and “The Star Boarder” are guar-
anteed antidotes to the misery of hollow
teeth, dyspepsia, corns and unrequited love.

“Hullo, St.Kilda,”the new Melb. Bijou revue
by the “Grafters” crowd, contains several
long-drawn-out echoes of a previous enter-
tainment, “A Day at the Races” ; but indi-
vidual acts in the first half of the bill mostly
merit a bouquet. Yal and Lottie Newman,
to mention the best, really deserve a brace
of bouquets.

The Maud Allan tour of Australia has
ended with the Adelaide season. The Cher-
niavskys laid aside their dignity to “accom-
pany” all the dances, and when they played
the Barcarolle (in particular) they seemed
to eclipse the star. The King’s has given a
little badly-needed strength to its programme
by introducing Roy Redgrave in a vivid
little “sketch” of war-time and spying; also
the Stagpooles brighten things considerably,
and Armstrong and Miss Howarth are
always popular. At this house, and also at
the Star, Lindsay Kemble, the bright youth
who, in girl’s clothing, fooled police and
public for some weeks, has been earning his
fine by showing audiences how he did it.
The Strollers on North Terrace compete
strongly with the Dandies across the way,
and neither party has reason to regret the
rivalry. The picture houses have a Dickens
outbreak, “The Chimes” being at West’s and
“The Carol” at Wondergraph.
AT POVERTY POINT.
Artist Harry Julius has just fixed up with
Australasian Films, Ltd., to supply “movie”
cartoons for the weekly gazette. This class
of picture has been used extensively in
the United States and England, but
Julius will supply the first Australian
series to be shown. The audience sees
the artist arrive at his studio and
search the morning paper for topics.
Then it observes him dash the paper down.
After that an enormous hand and pencil fill
the screen and the cartoon is drawn on an
immense scale, line by line, and with un-
canny rapidity. The experience of watch-
ing himself work in front of an orchestra
makes him feel like a disembodied spirit.
“Jonathan Gumtree” : Wilton Welch and
Louise Carbasse, who migrated from drama
to vaudeville in Australia, made a rapid
start after they arrived in the United States.
Upon landing at San Francisco last month
they signed on with the Orpheum circuit,
and celebrated a Sabbath afternoon and even-
ing by opening at Oakland, California, in
their sketch, “A Model Husband.” The
Americans are already remarking that the
graceful French-Australian girl resembles
their film idol, Mary Pickford. It is a re-
flected glory, but it will do no harm to have
it about until the lady’s work catches on for
better reasons.
On January 27, at Perth, Duncan Neven,
theatrical manager, was married to Angela
Molloy, whose father is interested in West-
ralian theatres. For some time past Mr.
Neven has been the lessee of His Majesty’s
at Perth and the Tivoli (formerly the
King’s) at Fremantle. In Sydney he used
to be manager for George Marlow, and after-
wards for George Willoughby.
“Vic”: Ellen Terry informs the Ameri-
cans that Melbourne was named after Melba.
It recalls G. F. Train’s “Young America
Abroad,” wherein it is written that Lord
Melbourne came up the Yarra in 1835, and
founded the city. The little bush township
of Warburton, in Melba’s Lilydale region,
enjoyed a privilege which London probably
never had, that of seeing and hearing Nellie
Melba and Ellen Terry in one programme.
They took the whim of motoring across for
a twopenny-halfpenny shivoo in the War-
burton Hall, in aid of the Mechanics’ Insti-
tute. A cheeky committee man had said in
a joke, “Let’s invite Melba and Terry.”
And they came!
“M.P.A.”: Little Irene Dillon, who was
born and stage-trained in Melbourne, was
recently doing a turn at the London Coli-
seum, singing “I Want to Go Back to
Michigan,” with an extra Emden verse.
Irene is oftener billed as an American than
as an Australian. Henry Clive, the “Ameri-
can” talking magician, is really Clive
O’Hara, the son of Dr. O’Hara, of Mel-
bourne. Annette Kellermann is also nowa-
days generally an American. On the other
hand, the more patriotic Albert Whelan
(also from Melbourne) never fails to bill
as “The Australian Entertainer,” and he
really cuts more ice than any of the others.
Amy Sherwin, the “Tasmanian Nightin-
gale” of long ago, is at legal loggerheads in
London with Stella Carol, the little girl
whom she discovered singing in the streets
one winter’s night. Amy trained and trans-
formed Stella into a star vocalist, and Stella
bound herself not to appear under any other
auspices than Amy’s. But Stella has now
grown up—has. in fact, recently married ; —
and she naturally thinks that early agreement
might be advantageously revised. To bring
matters to a head she embarked on profes-
sional engagements of her own, and for doing
so Amy brought her into court for breach of
agreement. The case was adjourned with
a view to amicable settlement. Incidentally,
it was alleged that Stella under Amy’s direc-
tion is capable of earning an easy £5OOO a
year.
Irma Caron gave a private show at Mel-
bourne Athenaeum Hall the other afternoon
of a high-class musical and dramatic “turn,”
for which she has yet to find an Australian
market. The versatility of Leon Caron’s
pretty little daughter is as impressive as
the strength and roundness of her soprano
voice. She sang songs in character from
“Carmen,” “Maritana,” a charming Japan-
ese ditty, and an Egyptian scena with
striking expression and gesture. Sandwiched
between the vocal numbers was a violin
solo, and her final item —the Egyptian scene
—concluded with a Salome dance. The
little lady’s big voice is growing in volume
all the time, apparently, and her dramatic
talent is crying aloud for theatrical experi-
ence.
“W.D.”: A New York paper is now
circulating in Australia that number which
contains a picture of the “naval disaster”
about which a London morning paper was
for a while so mysterious. A recent issue
of the same New York paper reveals with
minute particularity of detail the secret
history of the Von Spee squadron. One item
relates to a British cruiser which
“limped into Hongkong harbor to be
beached.” At the time in question the
cruiser was lying in Colombo harbor.
I know because I saw it there and
spoke with those on board. It had not
been in action, had not been beached, and
had not been at Hongkong. In view of what
I know about the cruiser, I don’t think
much of the same authority’s story of the
alleged “British Naval Disaster.” And I
would think more of its picture if it had got
the guns correct to scale.
Edwin Smith, Adelaide’s veteran philan-
thropist—he will be 85 in April—is putting
£6OO to do some good hard work. He is
president of the Commercial Travellers of
all Australia, and has sooled them on to
give a motor-ambulance from each State
to the war. He starts each list with £lOO,
which is about a fifth of the total cost.
Adelaide, being under his own eye, promptly
made up its £4OO, and probably the Travel-
lers in each other capital have by this time
got the hat filled.
Mulcahy, M.L.A. for Wilmot (Tas.), is
once more in the limelight. His last
appearance there was when he recovered
£6OO from the Labor Post for a libel. This
time he stepped forward in the House and
announced that the owner of a private tram-
way in the Nor’-West had offered him £lOOO
to bring about the purchase of the line by
the Government. At present the position is
that Mulcahy swears the bribe was offered,
and the tramway proprietor takes his solemn
oath it wasn’t, and a Commission is trying
to find out which of the two is talking
through his hat.
THE WOMAN PAYS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
She saw him yearning in the stalls
And marked at once her quarry ;
He fell (he’d had no previous falls)
Next evening at lier “sworry,”
She stipulated for a flat.
In his infatuation
He promised she should have it. That
Began his ruination.
She made him spend the boss’s cash;
She charmed away his senses ;
She made of all his prospects hash
By very false pretences.
For lies and smiles he paid in gems
Which she, wise wench, had tested.
The day they started for the Thames
Her victim was arrested.
It all came out —it always does—
And she was called a hussy ;
Which made her tiny brain-box buzz
And give off brain-waves fuzzy.
“The woman pays!” they heard her sigh,
Unto a buttering rector.
The woman pays! It’s all my eye!
The woman’s the collector!

An inquest held in Sydney a few days ago
disclosed the astounding fact that a woman
who was known to have suicidal tendencies
—she had attempted her life at least twice
before, once by opening a vein in her arm,
and again by stabbing herself in the breast
—and who had been an inmate of Gallan
Park, and was declared by one witness to
be “absolutely insane on one point,” had
been for a number of years head mistress of
one of the biggest schools for infants in the
Sydney suburbs. She remained in that
position in the public service until she
committed suicide by poisoning herself.
“Milo”: The Yellow Pup covered itself
with glory on the N.S.W. North Coast re-
cently. The general manager of the North
Coast Butter Co., the biggest co-operative
concern in Australia,cwas fatally injured in
a motor-car accident ei few months ago while
travelling on the co.’s work. He had given 18
years of his life to the business, during which
his working day was almost any number of
hours long, and during the strenuous early
times his salary was only £3 10s. per week.
The co. was lifted finally from the verge of
ruin to a level of prosperity not enjoyed by
any similar co. in Australia. The affluent
co., to do it justice, freely recognised then
the immense value of its manager, and the
directors voted his widow a year’s salary
(£800), and set aside a sum from reserves
to yield her an annuity of £l5O until her
youngest child should be 21 years old. The
co. retained the reversionary interest in the
sum invested, which thus really amounted to
a non-interest-bearing loan of 20 pence per
year made by each supplier. The cow coekies,
as a rule, liked the idea. But presently the
Pup detected the finger of Rome in the busi-
ness. The widow and children worshipped
after the ways of Rome; the deceased hus-
band did not. Moreover, some of the children
are —sit tight—being educated in a convent!
The edict went forth from the kennel that
not one penny of the Pup’s money should be
devoted to aiding these machinations of the
Pope. When the action of the directors
came before the shareholders for ratification
the other members waited for the yelp. But
it was a faint yelp, after all, because yelping
in a mixed audience doesn’t somehow suit
the Pup. And it was ineffective, anyhow,
for by a majority of three to one the meeting
voted the insect down, and the widow got
the reward her husband had earned for her.
Now the Pup to the number of about three
dozen has withdrawn its supplies from the
co. The co. won’t notice it any more than
Strawberry notices the mosquito that settles
on her horn. But the mosquito will notice
something when the usual bonus doesn’t
arrive.
INEXPLICABLE.
CHOLLY: “One of the strangest things about the female character is the tendency which
the prettiest girls always have to Jail in love with our inferiors."
“J.F.H.”: Yet another episcopal beggar
is with us in London —Dr. Trower, Anglican
Bishop of the Nor’-West. He turned up at
the last meeting of the Society for Promot-
ing Christian -Knowledge, and unfolded a
harrowing tale. He has to try to live on
£llO a year, and he has no house, room, tent
or office in which to carry on his work. What
beats the layman is that, no matter how
poverty-stricken a “colonial” diocese may be,
there are always funds available for a first-
class return ticket for its bishop to London
and the payment of his expenses for 12
months or thereabouts while he is (in the
orthodox phrase) “making provision for the
urgent needs of his diocese.” Dr. Trower
told the S.P.C.K. that “in Australia
bishoprics are founded with ease and haste.”
Somebody evidently was in a hurry when a
throne was raised in Nor’-West Australia.
But why not blame the church that makes
these absurdly premature appointments in-
stead of casting aspersions on the wealth
of the country which has had the unnecessary
gaiters thrust upon it?
* * * *
“Armes”: The nerve centre controlling the
Allies is in a village sclioolhouse 70 miles
behind the firing-line. Here are Joffre’s
headquarters. At that distance not even
cannon-fire can be heard. It is in the depth
of the country, far from the incessant move-
ments of motor- transportation, and in the
midst of ordinary humdrum life. Yet, with
naught to disturb quiet thought, every skein
is in Joffre’s hands. To this head-centre
six sub-centres are subordinate. These are
under Generals Pau, Foch, Dalstein,
d’Esperray, Castelnau, and Manoury. Tele-
graphs and ’phones link them up. So also
French is in constant touch with Joffre.
Abundance of motor-cars are available at
all the headquarters. Joffre’s schoolhouse
usually has from 15 to 20 high-powered
machines lined up in front of it. Yet there
is not much coming and going, and no fuss
about the place. The vast drama is conducted
noiselessly by wire. Now and then Joffre
dashes out to personally give an eye to a
position. Then he uses an automobile fitted
as an office, reminding one of a steamboat
cabin.
“Rimu” : A lot of people have been made
very angry by the German treatment of
women and children in Belgium, and millions
of pounds are being spent weekly to bring
the perpetrators of those deeds a little nearer
to the hour of just punishment. I suggest
that this is waste of good money. A fine
of five shillings and costs 'inflicted on the
Kaiser should meet the case. Here is a
precedent for the course I suggest. Last
week at Meerim South (Vic.), Christina
Grosen was convicted of keeping a child of
five years of age in an outhouse two chains
from the family dwelling and feeding the
infant on sour scones and refuse of bread
sweetened with molasses which had been
bought for feeding calves. The little girl
had to sleep on wet sacks, and, according to
the report, the place was infested by cats.
The Court took a severe view of the matter
and fined Christina one pound. And there
the whole thing ends, whereas if it had
happened to someone in Belgium the circum-
stances would have been cabled round the
world, and by this time thousands of good
women would have been sending flannel petti-
coats to the child.
* * * *
“Bloggs”: The Australian Government’s
official correspondent in Egypt has been com-
plaining of the drunks who are tarnishing
the Commonwealth’s reputation. They .num-
ber only 2 or 3 per cent, of the whole, he
says, and it is noticeable that most of them
wear the S’African ribbon. The significance
of this extends beyond Australia. Accord-
ing to a writer in the New Statesman
(12/12/T4) :
The aleoholist ,in Kitchener’s new army is always
a middle-aged man, and generally an old' soldier.
A generation or so ago drunkenness was
expected of a military man. One of the first
duties of an officer was to learn “to take his
wine like a gentleman.” That involved get-
ting blithered several times, so that the
youthful drinker might satisfy himself by
experiment, as to how far he could go with-
out becoming so hopelessly blithered as to be
a nuisance. From then onwards he was
expected to drink up to the danger-mark. It
was considered more admirable to go beyond
it occasionally than never to approach it at
all, a teetotaller being utterly despised. The
men naturally followed the example of their
superiors to the best of their financial ability.
Of late years the anti-alcoholic wave which
has engulfed so large a part of the business
world, to the vast profit of the tea-shops, has
also so drenched the army—not to mention
the navy—that the rackety soldiers whom
Thackeray portrayed would be as out of
place in a modern regiment as Pistol or
Falstaff.
LAMENT OF THE SEASICK PASSENGER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Only the Lord, who made the Sea, knows why it
falls and jumps
And travels like a mountain made of shaking
camels’ humps;
Its friend the Wind shoves it along and combs its
flying hair;
Green-faced, I watch the far blue land, and wish
that I were there.
The ship climbs like a mountain goat the foolish
hills that hiss ;
While poised aloft I gasp to see the yawning
precipice
That waits beyond the straight steel bows! Good-
bye ! we’re going down !
My stomach sends a wireless up: “Can’t we get back
to town ?’’
Another mass of camels’ humps! Another rise and
fall!
And, from my deepest engine-room, another wireless
call!
Only the Lord, who made the Sea and manages the
Air,
Knows why the Wind must drive the Sea insanely
here and there.
The World may be a cricket ball that He has thrown
through space,
And we may get a bump when it arrives at some
hard place ;
The Devil, racing for the crease, in rage may drop
his bat
When we arrive amongst his stumps and someone
cries, “How’s that?’’
And that’s the only reason I, observing God's green
sea,
Can find for all the movement that plays up so much
with me.
Or are we Devil’s medicine, and is this foam and
fuss
A violent tip that we are sold and he is shaking
us ?

“Adelaide”: If Melbourne Art Gallery
really wants Strutt’s “Black Thursday”
bushfire painting (B. 14/1/T5) it should
not be difficult to acquire. A generation ago
it was on the walls of Wivell, a veteran
picture-dealer of Adelaide. After his death
it haunted the salerooms, but the reserve
was always too high. For some time it was
lent to the Art Gallery, which, however,
finally decided not to buy. A lot of good
judges disagreed with this verdict, consider-
ing that, with the value given by its his-
torical subject, its level of workmanship was
about high enough. Then, four or five years
ago, it at last went —probably at a marked-
down price—into a private collection in
Adelaide. But that need not inevitably be
final.
THE SOFT ANSWER THAT TLRNETH
AWAY THE LAUGH.
H E: " Did you see that fellow's girl smile
when she saw me? ”
SHE: “ That's nothing. First time I saw you
I laughed out loud.”
TAKING NO RISKS.
S HE: “How deep is it?"
HE: “Only ’bout up to me chin.'"
S HE: “But which chin?"
“O.K”: “Me” (B. 14/1/T5) puts the
question: “How are the Allies going to
defeat the Germans?” I answer by their
superior strength of numbers and armaments,
and especially by what the Germans call
“the will to conquer.” Starting with
immense advantages at both ends of the
matter, the invaders played at the outset a
winning game, and are only now beginning
to feel the nerve strain of the man whose
cocksureness has changed to doubt. The fact
that the invasion was checked when the
Allies were comparatively weak testi-
fies to their ability to win when they
shall be in stronger force. On the
other hand, the German will to con-
quer was, if not quite broken, irre-
parably damaged by tne
Kaiser’s costly failures
to complete the con-
quest of Belgium and
get along to Calais.
Under cover of a thick
mist two companies of
Prussians sneaked
away and surrendered
rather than go in close
formation to certain
death. As time goes
on multitudes of men
who took kindly to the
idea of “marching _ to
victory” will be looking
for easy chances to
surrender in u whole
companies, as their
friends, the Austrians,
have surrendered.
“llow are the Allies
going to defeat the
Germans?” - By forc-
ing upon the Germans
the fact that they are
not winning any
longer, and cannot ex-
pect to win. Their
patriotism had the will
to conquer at the outset, but they
didn’t conquer quickly enough.
The spirit which inspired them has
evaporated in a great measure,
and the fear of being “done is
going to get them down at last.
In short, the Germans are going
to defeat themselves. They are
going to lose their arrogance, and
feel sorry, whilst the Allies con-
tinue hopefully to peg away.
General French wasn’t boasting,
bluffing or dreaming when he said
after the first tussle between his men and
the more numerous attackers: “We have
established a personal supremacy,” i.e., con-
fidence in our superiority. We are going to
win through our confidence, just as the b*er-
man is going to lose because he has dropped
his bundle on the road.
The girl with the unreliable yarn about
the mysterious ruffian has a mate in the man
who is discovered gagged and bound and in
possession of a stirring story about masked
and unscrupulous toughs. Usually it turns
out that he has robbed himself of money he
never possessed, or he has robbed someone
else. (Someone Else is 10 to 1.) Recently
a young man in the Newcastle district was
found wounded, with a narrative of robbery
and violence; and when the said narrative
collapsed he excused himself on the ground
that having pretended affluence, he had
adopted this method of explaining the absence
of his wealth in order to secure the postpone-
ment of his marriage. He hadn’t the price
of a marriage about him. Last week, again,
a youth was found tied up in a Sydney busi-
ness house. He also had a yarn of burglars,
but it transpired that he had merely stolen
30s. It seems a lot of trouble to take for
30 bob.
* * * *
“0.K.” : Here is a curious item of Times
news from the soiled front: —
When the floods washed out the parapets of the
opposing trenches the British and German soldiers
were in full view of one another. Until the damage
was repaired not a shot was fired.
Here was a lovely opportunity for two lots
of gallant foes to do what they are presum-
ably there for, and kill or wound one another
in a simple, inexpensive manner; but they
mutually refused to take advantage of it.
To fire at soldiers because their hiding-
places are temporarily destroyed is a breach
of etiquette, apparently. Next time I hear
a fat tenor sing “Yes, let me like a soldier
fall, upon some open plain” I shall exclaim
“Dickon !” or “Garn !”

About the most obvious railway out of
Adelaide —barring the one due north —has
had to wait till now to be made. Willunga,
30 miles south of the city, was one of the
earliest-settled districts, but till last week
Hill and Co.’s coaches were its only link.
After people had fought furiously over routes
for years, the Engineer-in-Chief followed the
line of least resistance. The rail was laid
first to Brighton, where the hills run down
to the sea. This gave a suburban section
paying its way from the start. It next goes
along the low cliffs, past Hallett’s Cove, the
hitherto inaccessible spot where the glacier-
scratched rock is seen ; then it turns inland
and runs parallel with the coast through
the vine-growing district of Maclaren Vale.
There are no tunnels; the one big expense
was a bridge over the Onkaparinga, and the
whole thing was done for £450,000. Already
there is talk of an extension of 30 miles
towards Cape Jervis, giving a mere 20-mile
sea-crossing to Kangaroo Island, instead of
the present 70-odd miles from Port Adelaide.
From the S. M. Herald’s news summary
(23/l/’l5) :
“The German offensive,” the official summary con-
cludes, “is broken, and their defensive will be broken
in turn.” .
The Germans are now making a violent offensive
in the region of Albert. _ . .
The enemy is also recommencing the offensive m
Belgium.
Confound these ignorant Germans! Don’t
they / enow their offensive is.broken?
“Armes”: All through Australia, it seems,
there has been a delusion that soldiers carry
flags into battle; consequently in various
places money has been raised to present
colors to regiments. Amongst the most
enthusiastic was Melbourne’s suburb of St.
Kilda, the district commanded by. that
worthy Hebrew, Colonel Monash. Till the
Boer war colors were taken into battle by
the British, as they still are by most nations;
then the practical Kitchener school dropped
the habit, on the ground that life was
thrown away in defence of something whose
possession really didn’t matter. When St.
Kilda found out the truth it organised a
pretty ceremonial, whereby the expeditionary
troops handed over their flags to safe cus-
tody. All agreed to deposit them with Pres-
byterian Chaplain Gillison, who accordingly
received them at his conventicle on a Sun-
day night; and there they will hang, instead
of coming home blackened with powder,
riddled with bullets and torn rag-a-jag with
grape. * * * *
It is announced in all seriousness that
the United States Secretary for War pro-
poses to add 25,000 men to the U.S. army
because there is a hustle in Europe, and
Uncle Sam may be dragged in before the
scrimmage is finished. He also proposes to
enroll 1000 officers —one officer to every 25
men. This would build up the army to a
strength of about 100,000 soldiers, and
10,000 generals, and a billion colonels, and
so many captains and land-commodores that
all the hotels in New York and Philadelphia
and Chicago couldn’t hold half of them.

.Tohn Bevan, of Sydney, stopped to watch
a free fight last week. He had no grievance
against anyone. He was unarmed and un-
trained. The sun was shining. He had
£ll3 in his waistcoat pocket. He was happy.
All he desired was to be left alone while
others deluged the landscape with blood.
Apropos of nothing whatever, one of the
belligerents walked up and hit him on-the
nose. Another smote him in the stomach;
and as a third aimed a kick at him from
behind, he executed a strategic retreat in
the direction of a refreshment-room. He
was followed to his new position by a
detachment of the enemy, dislodged with
considerable slaughter of glassware, and
flung into the road. The whole regiment
fell on him there and drove him back on the
tram-line. A war levy on his waistcoat and
its contents was torn from him, while the
tide of battle continued to surge to and fro.
At this stage the police came into action.
The original combatants were routed. John
Bevan got more than revenge: he got his
indemnity back. It was picked up, together
with two watches and a gold chain, on a
tram-line. He had better luck than mostly
befalls the unprepared State that happens
to be in the vicinity when a big scrap starts.

Importantly he waited there,
His tattered staff attending him, with windstraws

With dignity the soldier-boss bestrode his prancing

And from the troops a muffled cheer —-
A goat-scout madly galloping! What hasty news
is here?
Dripping with sweat, the goat-scout reined before
his Nibs most high,
Saluting humbly, yet with exultation in his eye.
“Speak up!” the mighty general said. The goat-
scout made reply:
“A British force approaches, sire,”
In short, sharp gasps, a living wire—-
“And some of ’em are horsed!” he cried, his wild
eyes flashing fire.

The German airship raid on England
resulted, at time of writing, in four deaths.
One of the victims —the one whose head was
blown off —naturally bore the name of Smith.
About one-fourth of the English population
is named Smith. Smith, the beheaded shoe-
maker. was the only deceased whose name
was mentioned. The clan to which he
belongs is a national institution.
PEACE REWARDS HER FAITHFUL
CHAMPION .
The Premier has received a notice issued by the
Nobel Committee, Norwegian Parliament, with
regard to nominations for the Nobel Peace Prize of
1915, accompanied by a request that the conditions
of the prize be made known to those bodies and per-
sons qualified to nominate candidates. —News items.
David Walker, for many years general
secretary of the Sydney Y.M.C.A., died last
week. “King David” was full of benevolence
and good intentions; but he narrowed while
the Y.M.C.A. broadened, and a younger man
like Virgo was badly needed to bring the
institution up to date. Still, as practically
the founder of the big concern, it kept the
old man in fond remembrance. For years
and years, while he was acting as hon. sec.
to the good young men, he was also account-
ant to Barnard and Hinton, the old firm of
wine and spirit merchants in George-street.
The death of Norman Shelley, a Sydney
commercial man, removes a link with the
missionaries who chartered the ship Duff
and went to Tahiti in 1790. Norman
Shelley’s great-grandfather was William
Shelley, one of the band. William was then
21 years old, and a cabinet maker. There
were 39 men, women and children in the
party. Of the men, 30 in number, four were
ordained clergymen, one was a surgeon, the
remaining 25 had various trades. The
Tahitians proved unfriendly, whereupon a
number of the missionaries came to Port
Jackson, settled there, and founded families,
which are thus amongst the oldest in Aus-
tralia.
A cable mentions that some of the French
soldiers, when on the look-out in the
trenches, wear helmets similar to the elon-
gated dippers that the Kelly gang used.
Ned and Dan Kelly, Steve Hart and Joe
Byrne each owned one of these clumsy-
looking things and a suit of armor. Ned’s
outfit is now in the possession of baronet
Rupert Clarke, having been given to his
father, the late William, by Hare, who was
clfief bobby at Glenrowan when the gang
was trapped. There is a second suit at
Melbourne Aquarium and a couple more in
the vaults of the Chief Secretary’s Office.
WELL ADVERTISED.
In the control of foodstuff supplies and prices the
Government has acted in the most cavalier and heart-
less manner to the hundreds and hundreds of strug-
gling people engaged in the poultry industry.
Sydney TELEGRAPH (16/1/'15).
MRS. WANTAFEED : “ What is the news?”
MR. WANTAFEED : “ Good, my dear. Owing
to the food supply being a political ques-
tion we are assuming great Press import-
ance as a starving national industry."
Tlie Kaiser is overdoing the pilot-
dropping business. Having dropped inter_
alia the head of his army and the head of
his navy, lie inis now fired his War Minis-
ter, von Falkenhayn. The War Minister
is always the Kaiser’s personal choice.
Falkenhayn's recommendation was that lie
was dynamic and typically overbearing. He
made his bow to the Reichstag when it was
boiling with fury over the Zabern incident.
In a contemptuous speech of a few words
lie told the maddened assembly that
Zabernism was going to continue. “That
was all there was to say.” For that the
army welcomed him as the ideal Minister.
He lias held the job since December, 1913.
Bishop Barlow, of Goulßurn (N.S.W.),
who is shortly resigning his see, was born
in the Cold Country and ordained in Aus-
tralia. He was the first Anglican priest,
entirely trained in this country, to be elected
to an Australian bishopric —North Queens-
land, in 1891. The good Australian up
North, when he requires somebody to bish.
for him, does not import a foreigner. Of
the four bishops North Q. has had —Stan-
ton, Barlow, Frodsham and Feetham —three
had been working in Australia for years
previous to the call. The Goulburn dio-
cese is threatened with a similar spirit. Its
first Bishop, Mesac Thomas, was imported :
but that was in 1863, when there was per-
haps some excuse for importation. On his
death, in 1892, Chalmers, of Geelong (Vic.),
was chosen. The next man. Barlow, was
brought from North Queensland, and there
is already a move to elect in his place Dr.
Radford, of Sydney University, though a
section of Goulburnites favor parson Wooll-
combe, who visited this country in 1909, to
found branches of the Anglican Men’s
Society.
Certain evil-disposed persons took a mean
advantage of Victorian Chief Sec. Yawn
Murray’s constitutional weakness one night
in January, entering his bedroom window
and rifling his pockets of a gold watch, rail-
way pass, certain moneys and other items.
The tired victim took the loss calmly. “They
weren’t too bad, anyhow,” he said. “They
didn’t disturb my rest.”
Alfred Deakin, who left for the United
States last week, as Australian Commis-
sioner to the Panama Exhibition, was in
San Francisco 30 years ago as delegate
from the Victorian Government to inquire
about irrigation. The agitation in Victoria
had begun with a philosophic plumber, one
Dods. He combined with Hugh McColl,
father of ex-Senator McColl. Hugh was
regarded as a crank, like one Gray who
went about England in 1820 foretelling rail-
ways ; and Winsor, who prophesied the gas;
and Jonas Ilanway, who first carried an
umbrella. McColl was regarded as a dread-
ful nuisance about Melbourne, with his
30ft. plan under his arm. He collared
Salmon Wilson on a very hot day, in the
Old White Hart, opposite Parliament
House. Wilson asked “Where will your
population come from?” McColl spilt a
little sugar on the table. “Whaur do the
flies come from?” said he. He converted
Deakin. and the Government thought it
would be no harm to let this other crank
go to California. Afterwards Syme sent
him to India. Deakin’s mission brought
the Chaffey Brothers, who were not lucky;
but Mildura and Renmark showed the way
to Burrinjuck.
Died, at Williamstown (Vic.), Captain
Charles Fife, aged 89. He was in the ship-
ping trade between Melbourne and Sydney
as much as GO years ago, and was reckoned
to know more about the tortuous Yarra of
old days than any other navigator. When
the Victorian Government imported Sir
John Coode to advise upon river and harbor
improvements, Captain Fife was the man
chosen to put the new-chum engineer wise
as to the tricks and turns of the channel.

late Superintendent of Sydney Botanic
Gardens. Forty years ago he joined the
staff under the late Charles Moore, and was
propagator overseer, and finally Superin-
tendent. He was an excellent landscape
man, and for their picturesqueness the
Sydney Gardens owe much to him.
The cables mention again that a Turco-
Teuton military railway is to be built to
Sinai. We know what’s coming. Poor old
Moses is to be superseded next.
JUDGE DOCKER (N.S.W.).
Captain Charles Patterson, just dead in a
Leeds (Eng.) Hospital, was a nephew of
J. B. Patterson, who. having been a butcher,
was reckoned the right kind of man to do
the necessary cutting down as Premier after
the Victorian boom of the early ’9o’s. The
captain went through the S’African scrap,
and afterwards was offered a commission in
a British regiment. As a captain in the
Lancashire Fusiliers, he saw service in East
Africa, and subsequently spent some time in
India. When the present shindy started
he had the wretched luck to get injured
while his regiment was in the act of embark-
ing for the front, and he never recovered.
His brother, a lieutenant-colonel, is Quarter-
master-General at the Pyramids.
The cable alleges that a certain General
Garza has established himself as President
of Mexico, vice General Guttierez, who re-
signed because he couldn’t hold his own
against General Carranza, though the
fatter is said to be running for his
life by reason of the hostility of
his one-time subordinate General Villa.
Meanwhile General Felix Diaz, can-
didate for the Presidency, and formerly
chief policeman, has vanished ; likewise his
uncle, old General and President Porfirio
Diaz, who was the big man of the crowd
and the only one capable of ranking among
the statesmen of the world. General Huerta,
who was President for a while, has de-
parted ; and General Madero, who was
President for a day or two, is dead. The
only interesting point about Garza is that
he recalls an old name. A good many years
ago a certain Garza, who was a partially-
demented agent for sewing machines, sud-
denly called himself a general, and declared
himself President of Mexico, and invaded
the country with a small force of drunks
which he had recruited in Texas. He was
the original of Ramon Castillo, the hero
of James Edmond’s story, “The City of
Free Drinks,” which appeared in the Lone
Hand of l/12/’ll. If the new President is
the same old pretender he must be very old.
If he is the ancient insurgent’s son it seems
that madness and insurrection run in the
family.
NO GENT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
King Edward said -to me once: “I am afraid there
will be trouble with Wilhelm before long. He is not
a gentleman.”— U.S. writer in London Fortnightly
Review.
1 never felt a trace of fear about the aims of Bill.
Despite his predilection for the Ivrupps.
The honest friend of gentle Peace he seemed to me
until
1 ran across him once while in his cups.
He leaned across a taproom bar, and argued with
the boss,
Employing words no Perfect Gent would use--
And instantly, as in a dream, I saw the War Lord's
Joss ;
And Bloodshed, and Bellona’s smoking fuse.
The years flew by; dark dread died down; for Bill
was lying low ;
One hardly would have known lie was alive.
(The German fleet continued, 1 need hardly say, to
grow;
The German army, foot and horse, to thrive.)
And then, as falls a lethal bolt, from bright and
cloudless skies,
A marrow-freezirg rumor sprang to life,
It came from one who knew Bill well, and who with
his own eyes
Had seen him eating oysters with a knife.
And now things went from bad to worse. Bill bought
a bowler hat,
And wore a tail-coat with it in the street.
He took to barmaid-chasing. Milkmen found him on
the mat
As dawn was breaking, “Shicked,” they said, “a
y treat.”
Dark rumors filled his fav'rite club concerning
stolen plate;
He ceased to shave, or wash, or brush his hair—
In which all men of vision clear discerned the
hand of Fate,
Denoting there was Trouble in the air.
I did not absolutely lose my final shred of nerve,
And realise that what I had to do.
If Peril was to be escaped, was, with the utmost
verve,
To bolt to Rhodes (U.S.) or Timbuctoo —-
I say I did not break right up, and give old Europe
best,
And flee in panic haste to lands afar,
Until I heard that Bill, in made-up tie and fancy
vest,
Was smoking with the hand on his cigar!
N.S.IV.

EARTHQUAKE AND WAR.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Along three hundred miles of front,
Upon a northern stage,
Old Nature looks from southern hills
To where the pigmies rage:
“They shriek and slash and roar and hew —
Three thousand die each day.
I shrug my shoulder in disdain
And fifty thousand slay.’’
VICTORIA.

Considering that the war broke out very
early in the half-year the figures are sur-
prisingly good ; and still they don't tell all.
The directors in their always very brief re-
port throw in a few words; the profits are
shown, they say, “after reducing premises
account, providing for bad and doubtful
debts, as well as granting to the officers a
bonus on their salaries.” Happy bank
which, after five months of world-shaking,
can not only pay the usual salaries and the
usual dividend, but give a bonus to the staff,
and announce, through the chairman: “We
subscribed [£250,000, it is understood] for
the War Loan Stock recently issued by the
British Government. .. .We have made a
temporary advance of £900,000 to the State
Government.... We have contributed liber-
ally to the War Fund here and in London.
....We have provided amply for any pos-
sible contingencies and losses that may arise
in consequence of the war.” And lucky
the country, too, which, six months after
the war starts, finds that one of its great
banks, after substantially increasing its
advances, holds more than one-half of all
its deposits, etc., in liquid forms.
When you see something growing as fast
as a pumpkin you don’t generally suppose
that it is as tough as mallee; and that
makes the strength of the Commercial’s posi-
tion all the more striking. Consider how it
has raced along in the last 14 years :
1890. 1904. 1914.

Debts compared with
£1 of funds . . 7.84 5.88 5.88
Liabilities compared
with £1 of liquid
assets .. .. 4.54 2.24 1.99
Thus, though the bank has increased its
liabilities (deposits, etc.) from £11,741,983
in 1890 to £23,112,084, it has been so care-
ful to increase its share capital and its re-
serve of profits that to-day it owes only
£5 17s. 9d. for every £1 of its own money
in the business, while in 1900 it owed
£7 16s. 9d. And whereas in 1890 for every
£1 it had liquid it owed £4 10s. 9d., to-day
it owes only £1 19s. 9d. Meanwhile the
bank has paid most of the time a steady
10 p.c. on new and old capital alike. If
the country in which a bank has been able
to do such things had been pushing ahead on
its own resources, we could leave off here
and give three cheers all round. The large
fly in the ointment is that in these 14 years
N. S. Wales alone has increased its public
debt from £48,350,000 to £119,500,000, thus
adding since 1890 no less than £71,120,000.
Claim, if you like, though it isn’t true, that
this money is represented by good assets
worth normally 20s. in the £; the fact will,
nevertheless, remain that the mere spending
of an average of over £5,000,000 a year
amongst a handful of people must inevitably
have produced artificial prosperity. The
most cheerful feature of the whole business
is that the great banks have recognised the
instability of the boom, and have put them-
selves in a strong position to face the
troubles which must come if the stoppage
of borrowing and a bad season hit us simul-
taneously. Only the support of the British
Government —obtained, too, in a way that
w 7 e can’t be proud of—saved us this year.

The C. B. of A. probably won’t for many
years get so good a chance as it has had
lately to sweep out the debris which the
boom made when it burst in the co.’s brand-
new head-office. The bank was a terrible
wreck. It was no use saying “We will
write down depreciated securities to present
value, and make that loss good by writing
down capital.” There wasn’t enough capi-
tal to write down. To save even the wreck
the depositors were invited to take pref.
shares—3 p.c. cumulative, rising to a maxi-
mum of 4 p.c. when the profits could stand
it. There is £2,117,350 of this pref. capital.
Of the old or ordinary capital, which has no
earthly right to exist, there is only £95,659
left. According to the balance-sheet, if the
old debts were ifow written off, the whole of
that £95,659 would have to go and £657,354
of the pref. capital as well. In the face of
that, it was a while ago proposed to pay a
dividend —10 p.c. was mentioned —on the
ordinary capital. Of course there was a
row. If the profits were good enough to
pay the ordinaries anything, they have been
good enough to pay the prefs. more than the
3 p.c. It was .only when it was proposed
to pay the ordinaries something that the
prefs. got their 4 p.c.—till then they had to
be content with 3 p.c. The proposal to pay the
ordinaries 10 p.c. almost simultaneously with
the increase of the pref. div. beyond the
minimum 3 p.c., and while the ordinary capi-
tal is still really non-existent, never should
have been made. It is to the credit of the
management that it has now been withdrawn.
It would have been much more to its credit
if there had been no need to withdraw it.
When the boom broke the lamest ducks
were turned over to an Assets Trust to
nurse. This Trust has now practically
completed its long job. The assets of the
old bank that remain are valued at only
£21,500. As the bank has made profits they
have been absorbed in large quantities in
making good the losses incurred by sellng
the old securities at under book values.
The greater part of the monev shown in the
first table as written off has gone in that
direction. Lumping the Bank and the
Trust, which are really one. since the former
has been responsible for the latter’s debts,
this is the position :

Six months ago, when the directors decided
to pay the prefs. 4 p.c. instead of 3 p.c., the
profits suddenly shot up £l3,ooo—more than
enough to pay the extra div. This time the
profit is back below the old figure ; and as the
increased dividend is still paid, the amount
available to reduce the deficit is carved
down from a recent average of £30.000 to
£18,072. If the ordinaries get no div. till
the deficit is wiped out at that rate, it will
be a long way to Tipperary. And mean-
time the balance-sheet will be disfigured by
the record of old losses unprovided for, and
every market list will quote most of the
shares of the bank at a discount. Which
isn’t good for any concern whose credit is
of value to it. The mess should be put out
of sight by making a reasonable compromise
between the two classes of shares and writ-
ing off capital. The largest obstacle
hitherto has been the inflated notion of their
importance held by some of the ordinaries.
The recent commotion may have pricked the
bladder and let some of the hot air out. In
that case a settlement should now be easier.

The liquid assets are nearly half-a-million
less; but note that a still larger amount of
old debt has been paid off. This leaves
£3,106,805 liquid, or 43 p.c. of the public’s
money in the business. . Advances have
naturally increased a trifle, owing to the bad
times in the Victorian and S. Aus. agricul-
tural districts, where the bank has many
branches; and, though wool money will
gradually come in, the bank will no doubt
have to add to the help it has given the
bulk of its rural customers. While, owing
to the extent of its current-account deposits
it isn’t in a position to splash money about,
it is quite strong enough to give its deserv-
ing lame dogs a lift over the stile.

else is a bigger borrowing connection. Look
at this: —

Premises, etc... 360,706 360,373 Dec. 333
Apart from the inscribed deposits, which are
to all intents and purposes fixed capital, the
bank thus owes £3,088,261, and its liquid
assets amount to £1,545,343 plus £15,000 put
aside to buy up inscribed debt. That is, a
shade over half the deposits, etc., are lying in
the bank liquid, and more than half of the
total is in coin and bullion earning nothing
at all. If the right securities were available
the A.B.C. could comfortably hand out more
accommodation, and thus show more profit;
and increased profit would fetch in more
deposits.
In any case, if it wanted more deposits
the A.B.C. would be able to get them —or,
anyway, should be able to. Certainly no
hank in Australia can offer better security.
There is £1,545,343 liquid towards paying
£3,088,261 of deposit and other new debt.
Against the balance of £1,542,918 not thus
provided for there are £4,073,361 of ad-
vances and £360,373 of premises, the latter
worth considerably more than that. For
every pound of debt for which there isn’t a
sovereign in the till, there are, therefore,
nearly £3 worth of assets; and a great num-
ber of those assets were recently written
down with an axe. When the A.B.C. wants
money it should therefore have no difficulty
in getting it. But it won’t want more money
till it can find use for what it has. And in
these days, when the older banks are con-
fining themselves almost exclusively to their
old customers, there should be an opening
for a new bank like this which needs new
customers.
All things considered, the profit for the
half-year is very good. True, it isn’t quite
as much as was shown for the corresponding
half of 1913; but the shrinkage is very
small, and the old 3 p.c. div. is fully justified.
It still allows nearly II p.c. p.a. of the capi-
tal to be put to reserves; in other words, the
profit is 41 p.c., of which 3 p.c. is divided.
The return is poor, no doubt, and seems
poorer still when it is considered that all the
capital is intact. There is very little doubt
on the latter point. When the new bank was
formed the assets were written down to
what was thought to be bedrock, and they
were written down still further after that.
The explanation of the poorness of the re-
turn, in spite of the foregoing, is that
the capital is too big for the present
business, and that is a fault which only time
and patience can mend. For over 20 years
practically no new customers went into the
old A. J.S. Bank; and you can’t get the
habits of 20 years grubbed out in a few
months. The public in a case like this has
not merely to learn something; it has to
unlearn a lot of things—has to be shown
that a strong bank may rise out of the ashes
of a weak one; has to slowly absorb the fact
that a bank paying 3 p.c. to its shareholders
may be infinitely stronger than one with a
share capital so insignificant that it can
easily pay 20 p.c. But time and patience
will do it—time and patience.

A trustee co. has to be inspected from
two points: from the client’s platform and
from the shareholder’s. First, climb up to
the client’s. A trustee hasn’t to be merely
good enough to be trusted while we are
looking at him. He has to be trusted with
our property when we are dead—so dead
that, if he gets away with the money, we
can’t make another start and proyide afresh
for the wife and youngsters. The job is
so important, indeed, that it is a question
whether any one man should be trusted
with it. He may go away; he may die,
and leave the job to his executor, who may
be a person we wouldn’t hand our dog to,
unless it was a savage dog; he may get tired
or develop a kink in the brain that will
change his whole nature. A trustee co.
does all the work that the individual can
do ; on the other hand it isn’t an amateur,
and doesn’t merely gain experience at your
expense; it can’t go away for a trip; in
ordinary circumstances it can’t die; and if
any one man connected with it gets the kink
previously spoken of, it doesn’t matter much.
Further, if, before the kink was discovered,
he had got away with trust money, this co.
has £90,000 of paid capital, £52,670 of re-
serves, and £60,000 of uncalled capital for
the wronged client to draw upon. Further,
the paid capital and reserves are solid.
Except for a Collins-street freehold, written
down to £50.000 (which is no doubt under
value), and £21,730 of mortgages, practically
the whole lot is liquid.
From the shareholders’ point of view the
first satisfactory feature is that the capital,
being in the just-mentioned assets, is excep-
tionally well placed. Next, while there
isn’t much risk of serious depreciation there,
there isn’t much danger from other things.
A trustee co. can no doubt be hit hard, as
this one was once, through misreading a
will; but such accidents are very, very rare
The great beauty of the trustee’s business is
that he can go to the court for directions,
whereas in ordinary affairs you have to do
a thing first and find out if it was wrong
afterwards. Also, the profits show a com-
fortable margin beyond the present divi-
dend. And they are not likely to shrink
much. The co. has £10,976,328 of trust
estates in hand, and they will remain in
hand. Bad times won’t resurrect the testa-
tors. Neither will bad times prevent deaths
and consequent automatic additions to the
business. Estates will, it is true, shrink in
value under adverse conditions, and the
corpus commission will shrink, too; on the
other hanu, the interest return will gener-
ally be higher, and the annual commission
will therefore be better. All things consid-
ered, then, bad times are likely to affect
trustee cos. less than almost any other class
of business, provided always that they don’t
suffer from the depreciation of their own
investments.
The Commercial Leather Process
Co. (Sydney).—This is merely a short ser-
mon at the grave. Don’t be afraid —quick-
lime lias been thrown on the remains.
Mourners may remember the announcement
of the infant’s birth. “The soundest propo-
sition ever offered to the public of N. S.
Wales,” it was headed. Earle Hermann
was the nurse. As usual, the public didn’t
put up enough money ; so within the next
few months a circular was issued by a
person who called himself the co.’s under-
writer. “Nearly six months have elapsed
since operations were commenced by this
co., and the results have been most satis-
factory and point to a brilliant future.”
Shareholders were urged to add to their
investment in “a sound, live concern, whose
dividends would be materially augmented
by additional working capital.” The results
never were satisfactory and they never did
point to a brilliant future, and the concern
never was sound. On the contrary, the
second annual report showed that a loss of
£4246 had been made. The business was
then put into liquidation. The patent
rights cost the co. £15,000 —£12,500 in
shares and £2500 in cash. There ,is little
doubt that advantage was taken of grossly
extravagant booming to sell these 12,500
shares or most ■of them. From the public
it appears that was extracted in
cash. The thing ran a couple of years;
then liquidation, and the shareholders have
just received 54d. per share! Had not
about £5OOO been sunk in freehold (after-
wards, of course, mortgaged) even that
would not have been saved. The wonder-
ful patent, for which the co. gave £15,000.
was largely advertised, was offered at auc-
tion again and again, and never commanded
a bid.
No doubt somebody ought to be in gaol
over this business. But the N. S. Wales
Companies law is so rotten that nobody
ever does get to gaol for obtaining money
by false pretences so long as the pretence
is made through a prospectus or a docu-
ment of the nature of a prospectus. But
apart from that —apart from making per-
sons seriously responsible for their repre-
sentations —there is something to be said.
In the first place, this co. was under-capi-
talised. A prospectus may ask for £50,000,
of which it proposes to hand £20,000 to the
vendors, and may show that the other
£30,000 is necessary to make a success of
the thing. But, 19 times out of 20, the co.
may go to allotment on applications for
(say) 25.000 shares. The co. has then
only £5OOO left instead of £30,000; for the
vendors collar their full £20,000. In this
Leather case it is possible that the pi-ocess
was of some value, though nobody seems
to think so. But even if it was, the co.
would probably have failed. Then, having
got £15,000 for the patent, the owner might
have comh along and bought it back for 15
pence. As a matter of fact, this patentee
died; and his friends didn’t seem to think
the rights were worth even the 15 pence.
A second point concerns documents of the
nature of prospectuses. Probably if this
co.’s “underwriter” had sent out a pros-
pectus with only the backing of his own
name, not much damage would have been
done. What he did was to make bait of
the mackerel already caught. With the
anneal for more money was sent out a list
of shareholders —“by which you will see
that the enterprise has appealed to some of
the shrewdest investors of the community.”
Any Companies Act which properly pro-
tected the public would prevent the use of
this sort of bait. The fact that people hold
shares is no proof that they think well of
the concern. They may hold them because
they can’t sell them, the public thinking
even less of the than they do them-
selves.

Australian Marine Fibres, Ltd. —This
concern, formed early in 1911 to dredge the
remains of a sea-weed from certain secured
areas in Spencer’s Gulf (S.A.), was
over-sanguine. The alleged market wasn’t
waiting, in the foreign textile trade, and a
large sum had to be spent in finding or
making another. As a result the co. has
become so badly involved that reconstruction
is necessary. The idea is to form a
new co., Posidonia Fibres. Ltd., giving one
10s. share for each 20 ss. shares in the
old co., and offering the shareholder also the
right to take another 10s. share at par. The
shares to be paid for in this way will be
10 p.c. cumulative and participating. The
capital to.be thus raised will.be £10,803. A
10 p.c. div. will absorb £1080; after that
has gone to the prefs., the entire 43,214
shares of 10s. each will rank alike in
further distributions. If the present share-
holders don’t or can’t put up the money
applications made by outsiders will be satis-
fied. This isn’t an investment: but it is a
gamble with the chance of a big prize. The old
co. spent £35,000, and has a plant, etc.,

Efficient grinding is one of the many problems
that mine managers have to solve. The Hardinge
Conical Mills have proved to the Calumet and T-Tecla
Mining Co. that grinding is not such a difficult
problem ; they have installed 64 of them, and say
“the Hardinge Conical Mill is the most efficient
grinding machine we have yet gotten hold of.” If
they say this of the mills, it should be worth the
while of mine managers here to inquire about them.

Lieutenant-Governor of Victoria of certain distin-
guished actuaries to investigate the affairs of the
Society, with the result that we anticipated. Those
gentlemen reported that at the date of their investiga-
tion (December 31, 1911) the Society was sound and
solvent, and able to meet all its liabilities, immedi-
ate arid prospective, and they expressed the emphatic
opinion that the charges of fraud, dishonesty, mis-
management and incapacity made against the direc-
tors and managers were wholly unjustified.”* [4

worth for breaking up purposes about as
much as the capital now to be put up ; and
of the capital to be put up (supposing all
the shares are applied for) about £4OOO will
be left after the old co.’s debts are paid.
There is thus some security for the pref.
capital. The £35,000 so far spent hasn’t
been wasted. Besides the plant, the co.
now has at any rate some sort of a market.
Not the foreign market that was expected,
certainly, but a considerable local market,
wffiere the fibre is used as a non-conductive
covering. The old co. was overloaded and
could not be recommended; but the people
who put up the money now come in on terms
that make the mouth water if there are any
possibilities about the industry at all.
Re Temperance and General. It was
stated (B. 14/1/’l5) that “a man who took
out a policy at 30 years of age, and had held
it for 20 years, would last year have got
from the T. and G. a bonus of £1 10s. p.c.,
which would have a cash value of 13s. Id.
The premium would be £2 9s. 6d.” Table
4 of the 1913 valuation shows these figures
as to bonuses in the Temperance section,
where the results are best. However, it is
a fair thing to say that the premium rates
were altered 15 years ago, and that a policy
taken out immediately afterwards —that is
to say, 15 years ago —with a premium of
£2 9s. 6d., would receive for 1913 a bonus of
£2 125., worth 19s. lid. cash. That is in the
Temperance section. In the ordinary section
the bonus would be not quite so good, yet
considerably better than under the old rates.

“Shareholder” : It is now nearly two years
since the Barrier Investment Co., Ltd.
(Broken Hill), issued a balance-sheet. The
last shareholders’ meeting was held in April.
1913, at which the accounts for the period
ending December 31, 1912, were presented.
Since then the long-suffering shareholders
have been in the dark as to the progress
(or otherwise) of the co. Isn’t it time
somebody said something?

Spelter, £32 per ton. In modern times it
never before was such a price. Since Aus-
tralia began to be at .all interested —say, 30
years ago—the highest figure was £29 7s. 6d.
in 1906, the lowest £l4 15s. in 1895. It is
an erratic market altogether: in 20 of the
past 30 years it has some time or other been
"below £2l. and repeatedly it has varied
£S in the 12 months. The present
phenomenal price is, of course, due
to the fact that almost the whole
of the production outside the United
States has been in the hands of Germany
and Belgium. The Broken Hill Prop, is now
turning out about 100 tons a week, and it has
hopes of making a contract shortly for the
sale of zinc concentrates —presumably in the
U.S.

The new Melbourne co.’s first crushing
at the Bodangora (N.5.W.)., from Dick’s
shoot, was 423 tons. With sands the total
value was £5 13s. 4d. per ton. After this
return a little lot of 35 tons from the old
Mitchell’s Creek lode appears poor stuff —
£2 12s. per ton. Manager Hooper reported
well on the possibilities of the Mitchell reef
south, and with sweetening from Dick’s he
may get on pretty well. The co. went down
to 97OTt. to try Dick’s shoot, and did pros-
pecting work on Mitchell’s reef before
sampling the bulk lot just reported. On the
last results, the directors think the mine
will be able to finance itself, provided Is. in
calls is first forthcoming.
A hefty crowd from Wagga co-operated
vith a few in Melbourne to drain off
of the water that was to be pumped into
the proposed new Bangadang co., Adelong
(N.S.W.). Objection was taken to the
Scheme for two reasons —(1) because the
present Bangadangs were only to get
£20,900 in shares out of £BO,OOO to be
issued ; (2) because promoters and the ven-
dors of outside mines were to be awarded
£40,000 in shares for their efforts and
shows. The promoters are the crowd who
are to take up 1000 contributing shares of
£2O each to furnish working capital for the
new co. This arrangement, if it compels
the payment in full of £2O per share, won’t
be too bad, though the com. even then is
fatter than a Hebrew money-lender. If the
contract will be merely to take up in a no-
liability co. £5 shares on which £l5 per share
may be called, further contributions will
depend on the shareholders’ willingness or
ability to fork up when the plate goes round
again. Anyway, the pressure nipped 500
shares paid up to £2O off the consideration
for one of the outside shows, thus sending
£lO,OOO of scrip into reserve. It would
have been more to the point if the squeeze
had fastened these 500 shares on to the
original Bangadang Co., and shareholders
are fools if. having the fat end of the stick
in their hand, they don’t fight to gain them.
The Pulganbar mercury mine, in the
Grafton district (N.S.W.), continues most
consistent in promises. The extraction
plant was erected some two years ago, and
after various trial runs work was at last to
start in dead earnest towards the end of
1914. As no clean-up lias been reported
nothing can be said as to the performance.
A much more important question is the
length of time that ore can be found to feed
the furnaces. The shareholders (mostly
Clarence and Richmond River residents)
recently showed their unshaken confidence
in the Board by re-electing the bunch.
A small sensation has been caused in the
Emmaville (N.S.W.) district by the reopen-
ing of the Webbs Consols Mine by a Mel-
bourne syndicate. Zinc values are good;
but they would need to be with a lode only
a few feet wide. Development work will
have to be very satisfactory to justify enthu-
siasm over this show, which never did any
good and has been dormant for about 20
years. Webbs Silver Mine, at Little Plant
Creek, in the same district, is also some-
what in the limelight, and legal proceedings
are said to be pending concerning the owner-
ship of the leases, which have been pegged
on several occasions. Meanwhile no start
has been made in putting on labor to see if
the silver values are as good as the Oldest
Inhabitant reports. In such matters the
Oldest Inhabitant is usually a snare.

Westraiia’s gold dividends for 1914 totalled
£780,723. Chief contributors: Boulder.
£202,500; Ivanhoe, £130.000; Kalgurli,
£96,000.
8., M. A Co. are probing the Yalgoo
(W.A.) back country on behalf of the
Yuanmi and others. Field’s Find is the
handiest centre. It is 70 miles from Yalgoo.-
Itothsay is 35 miles and Warriedar 14 miles
from Field’s. Itothsay was worked some
years ago, and a poor plant got about 28s.
per ton by amalgamation from about 6000
tons. Too much money was spent on things
that didn’t matter, and the show was given
best. A Boulder co. subsequently sampled
it and found about 20,000 tons of oxidised
ore available, worth 365. The sulphides will
give some trouble, owing to heavy water and
metallurgical difficulties. If, however, 8.,
M. & Co. take on the Warriedar properties
they will also very likely have a go at the
Rothsay, though it might not be worth
handling separately.
The Warriedar field was found about two
years ago, and has not made much noise so
far; but it has chances. From what is
apparently the principal lode, running
through the Mug’s Luck and Aurum, 100
tons, broken from a width of 18ft., gave
£IS3, with £269 (assay value) in the tailings.
Near this opening there is a shaft down
,150 ft. The sulphides come in at 115 ft.
None but a few grab samples have been
taken of the unchanged ore; but the oxidised
stuff has been fairly averaged, and is said to
be worth from £3 to £3 10s. From the next
lease 30 tons gave £5 per ton, with 40dwt. in
the tailings. The only other crushing was
of 15 tons from the Ironclad, yielding 4dwt.
by amalgamation, with 16dwt. in the tailings.
Apparently the heavy losses in the tailings
are largely due to the peculiar fineness of the
gold. While running the rule over Rothsay,
B. M. & Co.’s people—Klug, McLeod and
Walton —went out to Warriedar, and secured
options over all or nearly all the leases—
Mug’s Luck and Aurum, £9000; Warriedar.
£3500; Ironclad, £3000; the Porcupine and
one or two minor shows, £2OOO. In addi-
tion they pegged a dozen 24-acre leases sur-
rounding the field. The sampling options on
the principal blocks expire on Jan. 31.
The old Field’s Find is idle, but the present
owner is confident of yet doing good with it.
The old co. got 30,0000 z. from 35,000 tons;
but costs were allowed to bolt. The plant
was never much good and is practically use-
less now, so nothing much has been done by
the present owner beyond cyaniding the
tailings.
At latest mail advices the outstanding
feature of the Westralian market in London
was the continued bear covering or attempted
bear covering in Golden Horseshoes. The
rush to get in was due to the Stock
Exchange committee’s expression of opinion
that, as regards certain bear positions that
had been brought before it, members ought
to comply with any definite request for
delivery. A savage growl followed this
ruling. The extraordinary shortage of scrip
has been due chiefly to the Paris Bourse
being closed; and the bulk of Horseshoe
shares are held in France. However, since
then the bears seem to have got the upper
hand again.
Associated Northern’s new plant at Ora
Banda (W.A.) had its first run in December.
The month’s receipts from 900 tons of oxi-
dised and 1400 tons of sulphide ore were
£3282, but costs (including £521 expended
on machinery) exceeded this by £267. The
co. may earn fair monthly profits for a time,
but as the bottom of the mine is looking
rather sick and the main shoot shows a
strong disinclination to go down, the future
isn’t sunny. The co. is now well forward
with its sampling of the old Goodenough at
Menzies, but is not likely to find much there.
The Augusta (W.A.) has closed down.
Neither manager nor the director who was
present on the mine was prepared to say
why. But want of gold is undoubtedly the
primary reason.
Speakman’s (W.A.), in which Melbourne
capital has been ventured, is installing a bat-
tery on its Hampton Plains leases. The eo.
claims to have a good deal of payable stuff
available for the mill, and also to have dis-
covered a new 20ft. lode showing gold.
Boulder Perseverance’s profit for the first
half of 1914 was £16,081, and the second
half-year’s surplus increased this to £38,500,
which is £l5OO short of the sum required to
pay a dividend. As, however, the company
started 1914 with a substantial credit bal-
ance, it may make up the difference out of
this.
Meekatharra flourishes best of all the
fields in Westralia. Its gold yield last year
was 91830 z. more than in 1913, and was
the highest to date. Several of the mines
have improved in the last 12 months, and
as the equipment of some of them is being
added to, still bigger outputs are predicted
for the current year. The' Fenian remains
top dog as regards production, the value
of its output to the end of December totalling
half a million. Other aggregate returns
include Ingliston Extended. £189,000, and
Queen of the Hills, £140,000. The ore
reserves have been largely increased in the
Fenian, Ingliston Consols and Queen of
the Hills. Results from development in
the Ingliston Extended have been very vari-
able, while the Commodore has not shown
up as well as its admirers anticipated. They
now claim, however, that “it is only a matter
of time for its prospects to improve.” Among
new mines the Ingliston, late Commodore
South, is an easy first. Several good returns
were extracted from it in' 1914, and it is
tipped to do much better this year. The
deepest workings on the field are in the
Fenian (900 ft.) and the Ingliston Consols
(850 ft.).

From a man in the business :■ —
Mount Morgan’s profit for the half-year is appar-
ently £63,535; but the contingent account has
shrunk to £47,205, a drop of £35,380. The report
is silent as to where this trifle was mislaid ; but
there can be only one explanation—the contingent
account met the slump in copper, and this £35,380
either met over-valuation of metal produced last
half-year or figures as “Profit” and is included in
the £63,835 profit this half-year. Add that depre-
ciation fell almost £15,000 short of the usual
allowance and that no dividends were paid, and the
result is not exhilarating.
The working costs per ton of Mount Morgan ore
were 475. 3.7 d. for the half-year as against 60s. 2d. for
the previous 12 months. So says the report. This
reads well, but the figures are of no use to the
shareholder who wants cost per ton of copper pro-
duced, which I give below. Both amounts include
refining and realisation charges on the same basis,
but depreciation has not been taken into account,
thus placing both calculations on the same footing: —
12 months ended May, 1914. . . . £9O 4 0
6 months ended November, 1914 .. 93 710
Increase per ton during the last
six months .. . . . . £3 3 10
As it took 40 tons Mount Morgan ore to produce
one ton copper, the real costs show an increase of
Is. 7d. per ton of Mount Morgan ore treated. The
“costs” given in the reports are easily explained,
being based only on actual expenditure without re-
gard to recoveries. During the 12 months ended
May, 1914, no concentration except experimental
work was done; during the last half-year the con-
centrator came into operation, and passed out 22,000
tons tailings, which, of course, bore only concen-
tration costs —about 6s. or 7s. per ton. The average
of treatment costs was thus reduced to 475. 3d., but
with each ton of these 22,000 tons of tailings, metal
to the value of 9s. lid. was lost, so that the figures
joyously quoted are valueless, not to say misleading.
I estimate that when the concentrator gets into its
stride, with 500 tons per day, the directors will be
able to report “costs” at less than £2 per ton of
ore treated. The welkin should ring when “costs”
get down to this figure; but unless - the real costs
greatly decrease —and they have shown a steady in-
crease since 1912—1 can see the hungry shareholder
taking up another hole in his belt.
For £13,000 spent on development and
£SOOO on plant the Rosella, out from the
MacGregor Cloncurry, and owned mostly by
Hampdenites, can show 34,000 tons of ore
containing 2280 tons copper. At £6O per ton,
this means £136,800 gross value. Put costs
and realisation charges at £5O, and there
is £22,800 profit in sight, provided £6O can
be got for the metal. The reserves repre-
sent work to 200 ft. Between that level and
100 ft. calcite makes big, with values tailing
off once the limestone is entered. But the
calcite will serve as a flux, and as the plant
is up there must be a chance of running out
profits. If it will pay the Corella to smelt
its little lot, surely it is a good sign for
the Cuthbert, which some folk would like to
see barnacled on to the Elliott group. Its
Board is calling up the last shilling in three-
penny dribs to make shares paid uo. when
the co.’s second debenture sprint of £70,000
will be made by chairman Pigott.
No nutshell could contain the past and
present troubles of Poseidon Alluvial
(Vic.). All through the wash has gone
140 z., yet every prospect has curdled be-
cause of bad working conditions. _Six
months’ mining just done has seen 15470 z.
come from 815 fathoms; and although the
Board blandly announces a sound financial
position, that doesn't help the man who
took on a bank overdraft to buy shares
at 305., and now sees them loafing about
3s. Not only has the drift overhead accu-
mulated all the water that the cocky farmer
wants, but manager Visick’s worries have
been swollen by the surface slum and water
sneaking into his drives through ground
broken by subsidence. As a final stroke ol
bad luck the north-east and east drives have
lost touch in the gutter. A grope is there-
fore being done. As Visick thinks it has
cut away somewhere to the south, he is
prodding out in the direction Mawson has
flown. Not till he can hoist the Jack in
triumph over its recovery will Poseidon
smile again.

A WOMAN'S
LETTER
Sydney, January 25, 1915.
My Dear Artni,—-
One of the recent tales from Flanders
concerns a certain field hospital, which is—
or was —stage-managed by untrained nurses
of the British peerage. A Tommy who was
something of a wag, in spite of a broken
limb, contrived to pin the following notice
to the pillow: “Too ill to be nursed to-day.”
Then he burrowed under his blankets to
wait results. Details of results are still
awaited.
Calve, the singer with the wonderful
black-velvet eyes and an explosive temper,
is working with the Red Cross in France.
In her off-time she warbles lullabies to the
wounded. Part of the horrors of this war
consists of the determination of amateur
songsters to dog the convalescence of T.
Atkins with the kind of voices or nutmeg-
graters that make night hideous in our best
suburbs. Calve is one of the few minstrels
at the front who know their business. In
Australia she made her chief success in
the ancient ditties of Southern France, the
cradle of the troubadours. So Francois has
something to be thankful for if it is the olive-
skinned Emma who sings him to sleep, in-
stead of some screeching peacock with no
knowledge of the business.
A gentleman named Jackson has taken
to England the title of ex-May or of Erskine-
ville. It is quite genuine, for the grateful
populace elected him ex-mayor by a solid
majority. His safe arrival, under that
glittering star, is respectfully mentioned.
I wonder if, among the rush of titles and
dignities, it would be possible to boom in
Europe as Honorary Claimant of the throne
of Lyonesse!
There is a rumor that Louise Mack is com-
ing this way to lecture about the unplea-
santness in Belgium. Louise has already a
graphic pen. Now, to help herself forward
in the platform business, the Sydney woman
is studying the art of addressing the person
at the back of the hall —the individual who
is often entitled to have his money returned
because he hears nothing.
Phyllis Macarthur, one of the orphan twins
who live with their grandmother in Double
Bay, has agreed to share the fortunes of Henry
Charles Osborne. I fancy he is about the
last marriageable male available at present
of the big sheep-farming Osborne clan. His
flocks are shorn, I think, in the Cootamundra
district. He is usually alluded to in a
friendly fashion as “ ’Enery.”
’Enery aforesaid leaves this week to join
King Edward’s Horse, and his bride accom-
panies him to the English side of the
Channel.
Saturday’s races brought forth the striped
muslin dress in battalions. It is a simple
and becoming expression of the Sydney girl’s
desire to put the brake on dressmakers’ bills
in this time of innumerable war funds. She
is not yet sufficiently Spartan to deny her-
self a new hat, but it is generally a modest
affair of silk and a rosebud or two. The
large sash which binds the female form
round the hips can only be attempted by
the lady whose figure is of the clothes-prop
pattern. It is an ugly arrangement in any
case, and leads to rude remarks from the
small boy in the street. Still, it has to be
reckoned with as a recent design in summer
upholstery.
Races out of season are, so far as
women are concerned, a desolate void of
lawn strewn with bits of paper. The mem-
bers’ stand on Saturday was like a robbed
hen-roost, all the Society birds of finest
feather having disappeared. An occasional
heavyweight vision in Tyrian purple, tango
or mustard-green waddled past to cheer the
yawning spectators. But the muslin girl
predominated, and she generally wore her
second-deadest hat.
Mrs. Carty Salmon, over here on a visit
to the parental Harris nest at Darling Point,
doesn’t look five minutes older, and only a
few pounds more buxom, than she did when
she married the Victorian politician. The
handsome young matron brought two of her
boys to romp with Grandpa Matt. Harris in
their holidays. At Saturday’s race meet
Mrs. Carty smiled under the half-inch brim
of a saucy pancake hat, and tucked a hand-
ful of gold grapes into the waist of her
cream frock. The dainty-looking Mrs. Jim
Burns was in filmy black gown, with a
white hat. Plump Enid Bayly retired
within the generous circumference of some
blush pink drapery. Consuls Chayet and
Watteeuw were the only males present who
had turned out in extra-trim raiment. The
Belgian Consul’s taste in pepper-and-salt
suiting must move less dressy personages to
secret pangs of envy. Mrs. Adrian Knox,
not long back from Europe, didn’t air any-
thing of importance from the overseas’ frock
builders, and showed a homely crushed
purple and white effect as she climbed the
members’ eyrie.
Norman Shelley, a York-street merchant,
died the other Sunday at the age of 53. His
wife is the youngest daughter of the late
Professor I’ell, formerly of Sydney ’Varsity.
She mostly lives in England, where she lias
had one or two mild adventures in novel-
writing. The kindly Mrs. Frank Plomley,
who sits on all sorts of charity committees
from. dusty morn till noisy eve, is Mrs.
Shelley’s elder sister.
Mrs. Pearce, wife of the busy Minister
for Defence, hammered a rivet in the keel-
plate of 11.M.A.5. Swan the other after-
noon. The ceremony took place at Cockatoo
Dock. For some reason or other, even before
the enemy began to rage furiously, these
naval affairs were close preserves. Only
the innumerable local politician and his
friends and relatives, and a sprinkling of
naval frills, have access to them. A few
favored members of the press are allowed to
squeeze through to the parties. But the
average taxpayer is cold-shouldered if he
attempts to get within a thousand yards of
a bit of his own sea-mongery.
Actors’ Day wants all the help it can get
this year. It is the one day in the annual
grind on which the mummer goes into the
charity business for his footlight friends who
have _ fallen down and been eaten by the
wayside. True, there are occasional
matinees to help particular out-at-elbows’
comrades, but, giving all that in, the profes-
sion is more in the habit of putting money in
the hat for other people than of storing
away a trifle in a stocking for itself. This
year’s carnival is dated for February 6—in
the White City grounds. The profits go to
the Actors’ Association Benevolent Fund.
Roll up!
Mr. Jack Pockley, a son of Dr. Antill
Pockley, of Wahroonga, was married in
some suburban splendor to Miss Nancy Sar-
good, of the same wealthy subbub. The
bride is a daughter of F. G. Sargood, of the
well-known softgoods firm which first had its
headquarters in Victoria.
At regular intervals some bathos finds its
way into the papers concerning certain fool-
ish gatherings at the Royal Naval House.
These meetings, at which naval officers’
wives, many of them quite young and brand
new at their job, “entertain” the wives of
petty officers and seamen with tea, hand-
shakes, and frequently indifferent music,
appear to dissolve in tears at regular inter-
vals. I forget how many silly stories about
the Australia have been told at the enter-
tainments. However absurd the rumor, the
meeting promptly sobs over its teacups.
Even the minor grievance that Mrs. Captain
Tar Bucket forgot to shake hands twice
with Mrs. Able Seaman Jollygirl, and dis-
tinctly omitted to kiss Miss Anice Sortogal,
is swallowed up when our battleship has
been “sunk” for the 43rd time in five months.
A notice to the effect that our phantom
wreck will not be allowed to haunt the
Royal Naval House might be posted up by
Superintendent Shearston.
The White City fancy-dress carnival
packed that open-air show-place like a
herring barrel. Whatever grievance other
public entertainers may have against Wil-
helm 11.. Manager Eslick seems to be im-
mune. The crowd works its way patiently
(if it waxed impatient it would be squeezed
to a pancake) through a narrow turnstile to
the promised land, and the management
banks the profits. Also, it has the wisdom
of the boa-constrictor, though it coos like a
dove. So it doesn’t raise the gate money as
much as sixpence even if it provides Is. llfd.
worth of carnival.
The long-suffering French and Belgian
consuls- —who never have an evening they
can call their own—were, as usual, toeing
the official mark. They were special referees
for Belgian and French fancy dress. Mr.
Welch, the red-headed young man who acts
as trade agent or local consul for Russia,
did his best with the Russian drapery as
one of the reference committee. The Bear’s
Consul-General for Australia, by the way. is
fixed in Melbourne. Here and at the other less
favored townships w T e have merely consuls,
vice-consuls and consular agents.
Mrs. Everard Digby, whose hubby is
putting recruits through the goose-step in
England, gets recent news that Australian
contributions, are going to the right spot.
Many a Belgian babe who arrives as a weep-
ing refugee is wrapped up in newspapers
when if faces the first bleak winter wind
of England. The parish halls, in various
towns, are filled with our little bit of help.
The refugees are taken to these free stores
and given the garments that fit them. “There
seems to be neither over-lapping nor waste,”
Mrs. Digby is told.
Solicitor Frank Ebsworth was quietly
wed to Miss Ada Cruikshank, of this ham-
let, the other day. The ’groom was supposed
to be a confirmed bachelor, and he certainly
was one until his marriage; but he changed
his mind (as all bachelors do when they
marry) in ample time to avoid the suggested
Federal tax on woman-haters.
After gumming up last week’s letter to
you a cable hinted that Marjorie Squier had
said “I will” to Rex Rabett. The ceremony
took place in Cairo. The Sydney man, who
is an artillery major, went to Egypt with
the expedition which is showing the Sphinx
how to drill. Engagements at long range are
dangerous things to handle unless all parties
kiss the Book and swear they are a dead
certainty. Hence I didn’t risk telling you
before that the former N.S.W. damsel who
had been engaged to Rex Rabett, and was
then disengaged, was alleged to be re-engaged
to her young man when she recently left
England for the sandy Egyptian back gate
of the fray. The statement happened to be
correct.
Pretty Eileen Murphy, a Rose Bay bud,
marries young Fesq (I hope that’s exactly
how he spells it) on February 16.
Our best suburbs have been telling each
other for several weeks that the plump
Thelma McQuade —a daughter of the musical
Fred McQuade and his handsome missus—
had said “Yes” to George Innes. The news
is hereby confirmed. The ’groom-expectant
is one of the Parliamentary Draughtsmen
in the Crown Law Office, and is a son of
the late Justice Innes, who delivered many
learned judgments about usufruct, and de-
murrage, and unearned increment, and back-
wardation, and unlawful entry into the tene-
ment with a view to the seizure of goods in
satisfaction of unpaid rent.
The Town Hall sewing circle is to resume
business on February 1. Notice to this
effect has been freely circulated in the hope
that the shirt-and-socks ladies may snare
fresh recruits for the Cause. Mrs. Mayoress
Richards, who did a lioness’s share of the
toil in 1914, is snatching a country holiday
till the summer tames down to a simmer.
The Australian tourist has been gadding
to Maoriland and Tasmania with mountain-
ous piles of Saratogas, since the summer
settled down to business. Among those to
lately wave good-bye to Sydney were Justice
Buchanan of Adelaide, and Miss Buchanan,
who take a. small helping of M.L. scenery;
the much-travelled J. B. Dixons, who are
not long back from Japan and the Philip-
pines, and are now going through the
Dominion from Auckland to the icy waters
of Wakatipu; and three brothers —Frank,
Eric and Percy—Dignam, of this city, who
are going to foot the famous 33 miles to
Milford Sound. The tourist who strikes this
tramp too late in the autumn is apt to fall
into an early snowdrift. Even the much-
boosted M.L. hare soup which is waiting for
him on the w*ay doesn’t thaw him straight
off. Still, it counts for something to be able
to throw that Milford Sound track at the
heads of tourists who merely lose their lug-
gage in M.L. trains. Finally, Dr. and Mrs.
R. Beith, of Kiama, are going to float down
the lovely Wanganui and journey south to
Queenstown.
When United States art critics pour out
the melted butter they do it generously.
Raymond Wyer, director of the Hackley Art
Gallery (Michigan), gives Lambert this
liberal serve:—
George Lambert is considered to have expressed
the essentials of rhythmic line, motion and decora-
tion in his work to an extent not surpassed by any
painter of to-day, except perhaps Augustus John.
As some of Lambert’s bold brushwork hangs
in the Hackley Gallery, Michigan is appar-
entlv satisfied with its dollars’ worth of Aus-
tralian artist.
Artist Charlie Wheeler has flung in his
lot with the Royal Fusiliers, and is in camp
in Sussex.
In London the woman dentist is giving
her share of attention to military jaws be-
fore the owners take them to the trenches.
Mrs. Fiske, a sister of General Hoad’s
widow, is among these honorary toothsmiths.
and at the last tally had inspected the gums
of 600 soldiers free of charge.
Dr. Cecil Bluett, of Sydney, is amongst
those in charge of the Military Hospital at
Chatham.
The _ news _ that Mrs. Aspinall, wife of
Dominie Aspinall, is dead will be received
with genuine regret by scores of strapping
young men who were mothered by her in
their knickerbocker days at Scots’ College.
Her popularity with homesick .youngsters in
the days when her husband was principal of
the school was unbounded. Mrs. Aspinall
passed out in London after a long illness.
Her daughter, Dr. Jessie, was to have left
Sydney for England on Saturday, but can-
celled the trip.
“The Chaperon” is withdrawing from the
Palace Theatre to give- “The Glad Eye” a
week’s chance. The Beaumont Smith team
deserves a larger theatre and a crammed
treasury-box for its spirited performances
of French farces. These have a sparkle
the dull musical comedies of even date can’t
find. But this is a planet where deserts are
handed out by blindfolded Injustice. So it
may be that two-thirds of the community
haven’t seen the fascinating Ethel Dane in
“The Chaperon.” This recently-returned
Australian actress knows the art of clothes
from the crown of her head to the points of
her absurd little shoes. She is too brainy
to get into the genuine fashion-plate busi-
ness ; nevertheless in a magpie creation, with
white bird's-nest fixings on her flaxen locks.
Ethel is It. And It is a hopeless effect for the
unco’ plump to try to imitate, for anything
over seven stone or thereabouts would fall
through the filmy garments that protect the
willow-wand girl from the weather. Still,
they’re good to look at on sweltering summer
nights. A black-and-white gown that sug-
gests morning dew tied togetner with a sash
of the middle of the night must be cool and
seasonable.
According to the British-Australasian
concert-manager Southwell leaves London
this month for Sydney. Still, he has been
talking of home and harbor for months, and
doesn’t “get any nearer than Paris. A post-
card from him a week or two back was
written from that once-frivolous city, where
the male dress-designer used to charge
about 1000 francs for a yard of sash
ribbon, and a dream of hove it should be
worn.
A dainty little Woolwich maiden. Joyce
Kettlewell. has made promises to Robert
Cameron Sharp, of Adelaide, and flashes a
diamond ring in witness thereof. She is a
daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Kettlewell. whose
nest hangs on the bushy eyebrows of the
Parramatta River. The mother writes the
Sydney end of the Australasian’s social
and dramatic column. She is better known
as Agnes Storrie, the South Australian
verse writer. Young Sharp goes with the
next Australian contingent to Bhamo, at the
upper end of the Irrawaddy River, on the
edge of China, in order to keep an eye on the
Persian marauder, and to lend a hand to
Russia in its struggles along the Hungarian
border. (This information is intended to
deceive the enemy.)
Phillips Pox has just finished a portrait—
head and shoulders —of Mrs. Alfred Deakin.
who went off with her husband last week to
see ’Frisco and talk Australia. President
Herbert Brookes, of the Melbourne Chamber
of Manufacturers, has had his appearance
reproduced in oils by the same artist. This
Brookes, you remember, married one of the
Deakin. girls. Now the trustees of the
southern city’s Gallery have commissioned
Phillips Fox to do his best with a three-
quarters length of Mr. Connell, the 1914
donor of an art collection. Mrs. Fox, who
camps at Cremorne this summer, is helping
to push an Artists and Art Workers’ scheme
for raising war funds. The cash is to be
used to buy a motor-lorry for the Front or
the Rear or the Flank Movement. A meet-
ing in the Royal Art Society’s rooms on
January 28, at 8 p.m., will worry through
preliminary details.
Charles Murray-Gibbes, the tall young
baritone who used to warble in the J.C.W.
co., has come home again, after five years
on the top-side of the map. He studied
for a while with Reg Sommerville, a London
composer of light, tuneful music. Then he
took his baritone to Bouhy, in Paris, for
further treatment. He had various English
engagements, notably with George
Edwardes’s Gaiety Co., till the war broke
up the amusement business, and he has been
writing popular songs in his spare moments.
Here he proposes to give recitals and teach
till the storm blows out to sea. “Just
Memories.” his latest ditty, is now on
Paling’s publishing machines.
The Women writers (London) send a
circular backing up the appeal to Australia
which comes from the British Women’s
Emergency Corps. The Bank of New South
Wales has consented to receive subscrip-
tions in all its branches. Flora Annie Steel,
Beatrice Harraden, the sentimental Glyn,
Baroness Orczy (the lady who wrote about
the Scarlet Pimple), and Ellen Thornycroft
Fowler append their names to the cry for
help for the actresses, artists, musicians,
journalists (notably the free-lance tribe),
typists and others who are hanging out
signals of distress. The Duchess of Marl-
borough—who used to be Consuelo Vander-
bilt, the N’York heiress —is hon. treasurer.
Grace Watson, who used to abide in this
continent, sends an interesting line from
London. She dovetails an account of a
Travellers’ Dinner given by the Lyceum Club
to Mary Gaunt on to serious reflections re
the enemy raids on Yarmouth bloaters. At
the literary meal a lion or two, albeit of
close-cropped mane, munched the cake of
peace. Sir Donald Wallace gave his im-
pressions of Russia after spending 40 years
in its snows. But Stephen Graham was the
titbit of the evening—Graham, the much-
travelled journalist who was in the far
recesses of the Czar’s country when war
broke out. According to Grace, he resembles
the portraits of Charlotte Bronte. His
voice is pleasant and low-toned, and his
personality charming. “It’s quite a relief
to see a celebrity who looks the part,” says
the Australian woman, whose guest at this
party was Miss K. Pritchard, of Melbourne.
Yours affectionately,
VANDORIAN.

NELSON'S
(Concentrated)
Fnilt Juices
It is imperative, in order to promote busi-
ness and produce satisfied patrons, to serve
only the best flavored drinks. NELSON’S,
during the experience of many years in the
Soda Fountain industry, have devoted much
attention to this branch of the business.
No efforts or expense have been spared to
obtain the best, and great success has
followed, as the popularity of our Fruit
Juices amply testify.
Our aim has always been “Quality”
rather than price—to make the best —-

to get the right flavor, and then to make our flavors as strong as possible,
retaining the aroma and solubility so necessary to the production of beverages of
the highest class.
In our extensive line of Flavors we believe there is none that will not,
properly used, produce satisfactory results, but there are a few specialities of
distinctive merit in which we take particular pride and challenge competition,
viz., our Lemon, Ginger-ale, Sarsaparilla, Strawberry, Orange, Cream Soda and
Grape. To our many customers using these Flavors the goods speak for themselves.
Trial orders are solicited from fountain-drink suppliers who are not using them,
and are consequently missing a good thing.
Don’t run the risk of using Flavors about which you are not perfectly sure.
A disappointed customer never returns and you can’t afford to lose one. Take our
advice. Buy only the best—it’s NELSON’S —and it’s sure to please.
We carry full stocks of Hungerford Smith’s crushed Fruits and Fruit Juices,
Stevenson and Howell’s Ltd. Red Ball Essences, Whole Cherries for Sundaes,
and a host of other goods required by every supplier of Fountain Drinks.

MELBOURNE CHATTER
Melbourne, January 25, 1915.
My Dear Arini, —
The lioyal Yacht Club raced on Saturday,
and every possible sort of craft followed the
white wings. All would have been joy and
gaiety, but alack ! there was not a solitary
Governor present. Our refined Salts feel
keenly that there is not a water-sporting
vice-regal in sight at present. Commodore
Albert, who owns Rawhiti 11., was over from
Sydney; also vice-commodore Saunders.
But these, though welcome enough, are poor
substitutes. The thrill of the day was the
inter-State motor-boat race, run over a
course between St. Kilda and Williamstown.
St. Kilda pier was stiff with the Yery Best
People—the kind that bring their race
glasses and square their elbows into their
neighbors’ eyes and remark, “Haw —Ai m
sorry!” when they knock each other’s head-
gear off. The Kangaroo, which Tony Hor-
dern first raced here, came over for the
event. McFarlane, from South Australia,
brought the Millewa —engines and boat built
in Port Adelaide. McFarlane, who steered
and managed the flying craft, was a trium-
phant though grimy figure as he dashed past
the pier a good second. Fred Cornwell won
with Nautilus II. —he at the wheel and
brother Percy at the engine. The course
was perfection. The bay was calm and
dazzling in blue sunshine, and on the home
track (the straight, as it were) the racers
looked balls of white spray, or aeroplanes
kicking the sea, and a flurry of foam where
the tails were sunk in water. The Sydney-
siders particularly appreciated the long,
clear run. Their harbor has so many turns
and such a surplusage of bothersome craft.
The Kangaroo, of which great things were
expected on its Sydney and Monte Carlo
form, disgraced itself by breaking down in
the first heat. It retired sulkily to the
breakwater side and was tinkered up. After
the races were all over its captain showed
what it could do. It snorted round the pier,
then shot off like a streak for Williamstown.
The pier crowd applauded and snapshotted
in a frenzied way. Every second girl and
youth carried a camera.
E. C. Griffiths, who is honorary secretary
to the N.S.W. Motor Yacht Club, was a
visitor. It was he who gave the Griffiths
Cup for which the boats raced.
Mary Stirling and Dr. Croom will take
the irrevocable step in March, aided by Mrs.
Ross-Soden, in the capacity of entertainer of
the wedding-guests. In April Belle White,
of the Titian locks, hands herself over to
Percy “P.O” Alderton.
Alec Kelly, a brother of big Bowes, is
back from his long prospecting trip in the
Northern Territory with a pocket full of
copper ore. In his absence his son, Walls-
court, took a mean advantage of him. The
youngster grew three inches above the
paternal six foot two, and is still moving.
Sorrento, down the bay, is simply seething
with Sassiety. Not another aristocrat could
be wedged in with a shoehorn. A tennis
tournament is brewing, and competitors,
male and female, are hurrying forward at
the bugle-call of social duty from far afield.
Talking of Sorrento, Dr. Rothwell Adam’s
daughter Elsie has just breathed “Yes,” in
those occasionally moon-bathed surround-
ings, into the ear of George A. Wilkins, of
St. Aubin’s.
Hussein Pasha, the prince whom Ola
Jane Humphrey married and got away
from, has been given high rank in Egypt by
the British Government. Ola is acting just
now in N’York, where they love a princess
better than chewing-gum, and you may lay
your ultimate garment, as they say in Hush
Koosli (Pa), that she is making no conceal-
ment of her rank. In fact, I wouldn’t be
surprised to hear that, provided the wan-
derer’s new position is a particularly glit-
tering and well recompensed one, the sunset-
haired lady has been induced to kiss and
make friends again.
This story has streaks of romance, pathos
and bellowdrama. A wedded lady, whose
husband wanted an infant of his very own,
arranged to adopt one that had just been
acquired by an unmarried mother. Having
secured the clie-ild the wifely deceiver also
obtained the bonus, for the sake of veri-
similitude. Just about here somebody in
the Maternity Branch took to noticing
things, and it was found that another
female—the real mother —had already been
rewarded for her services to the Common-
wealth in respect of the same infant. The
upshot of the affair is that the purchaser of
the youngster and a nurse are being asked
to explain matters.
From “Rosna,” in Britain
Adelaide's artist, Margaret R. Maepherson, has two
of her still-life pictures on the line in the New Eng-
lish Art Club's show, which is being held as usual
in spite of baby-killing Zeppelins and other forms of
culture.
London People, a Sunday paper, has a cartoon
showing a kangaroo leaping the Suez Canal, to the
horror of a cringing Turk. Underneath is an “orig-
inal poem,” unsigned, of course, and labelled “The
Ballad of the Bally ‘Bounder.’ ” The “original
poem’’ consists of three verses of C. J. Dennis’s
“Australaise,” stolen from The Bulletin, slightly
garbled, and with “bally” inserted in all the blanks
to suit the Chadbands of England.
Eustace Black, the doctor-son of the J. M. Blacks,
of Adelaide, who went-to the front with a commis-
sion in the R.A.M.0., was appointed, after two weeks’
service, regimental medical-officer to the famous
Gurkhas, known to Kaiser Willie's troops as the
little-brown-devils-who-smile.
Elsie Mary Denham’s new husband, Major the Rev.
Richard Henry Staacy, senior chaplain of the
Canadian forces, is rector of All Saints’, Ottawa,
when it’s the close season for Germans.
The British Australasian, which costs to ordinary
citizens a whole sixpence, is issuing a “Soldiers’
Edition,” at a penny for our boys at the front. If
we had to depend on the English press for news of
Australia we’d soon forget it was on the map. Two
infuriated Australian girls I know rushed up and
down the street at the time of the sinking of the
Emden, and examined every single poster to see
whether Australia was mentioned in the matter.
And it wasn’t!
The voice of memory whispers to my pen
that Professor Black, recently deceased in
Maoriland, left a daughter, Madge, who mar-
ried one of the Thompsons, of Stewart
Island, which damp-edged piece of planet is
only less famous for its Thompsons than for
its oysters. One of the young girl-Thomp-
sons was said to have great singing possi-
bilities. Melba “took her up,” as the ver-
nacular has it, and she was sent abroad for
culture. The public seems to have heard
little more about the gifted young lady.
Possibly the din of war has drowned her
top note.
Barry Lupino is working strenuously for
the overthrow of the Kaiser. Last week
he did a bit of window-dressing for the
Empire, which brought, by way of a collec-
tion from the gaping public, a sum of £52.
And now he offers himself as salesman for
a day in any shop, if the proprietors promise
a tenner to the Belgian Relief Fund.
I hear that there are women Bobbies now
in London. Their helmets are not so lofty
as those of the male Roberts, but they are
hard and glazed and are decorated with
chin, straps. The uniform otherwise is a very
short skirt, a belted tunic and a soft collar
and tie. The boots, presumably, are regu-
lation beetlecrushers, with rubber heels.
Leonora Roberts, who married Amadio the
other day, is not a daughter of the Chairman
of the Stock Exchange. I know, because
he has written and said so himself. Leonora’s
father has the same initials as the stock-
broking magnate, but he is no relation. The
broking business bristles with Robertses.
There’s the debonair chairman of the Ex-
change, and there’s the new father-in-law
of Amadio, and his brother, Alf Roberts,
who brokes on the Adelaide Stock Exchange,
and goodness knows how many others.
Most of Melbourne Sassiety is off to
ITobart in the wake of the Fairrgussssons.
The G.-G. and dimpled little Lady Doris,
with one lonely aide, are bent on a motor
trip of the East Coast of the Apple Island
after the races.
The Carlyle Smythes are on their way to
London, via Java. They have volunteered
to the Belgian authorities for any posts
where an acquaintance with English, French
and German may be of use. Carlyle Smythe
is almost half a Belgian, having lived in
Brussels some years editing a daily paper.
He was incorporated there (along with all
other foreign residents) in the Garde
Civique. Smythe also wrote a history of
the Belgian people for English readers.
Yestelle’s Grecian musical troupe is really
the well-known Magpie Orchestra. The
matrons and maids who constitute it are
intensely musical, and in a more elevated
sense than that of the Yng. Gent, of Rising.
App. who advertises for a wife—Means
Essential. They handle Wagner with sur-
prising effect considering the dearth of
drums and tom-toms. Mrs. Summerhayes,
who leads them into action from the piano,
saw Wagner conduct “Tannhauser” with her
own eyes and heard the result with her ears.
She insists on a fast tempo at one point,
which modern conductors refuse to recognise.
This difference of opinion nearly led to
blows (or tears) on the first night. Mrs.
Summerhayes is a wonderful old lady, who
is 70, looks 50, and works as if she were 20.
Mrs. Geoffrey Stuart, who was Cecily
Innes-Noad (of Sydney) a month ago. had
the Friday-till-Monday honeymoon winch is
the vogue these days. Her husband then
departed for his particular section of the
war. The grass widow waits in Mel-
bourne for her sister Joan, who is returning
from troubled old Europe by one of the
mail steamers. Mrs. Stuart goes to Eng-
land in April to join a very sad family.
Her husband’s youngest sister was married
to Commander Scott, and he went down
with his boat in the torpedo-infested seas.
Lord Frederick Conyngham, brother and
heir of the Marquis of that novelettish
name, has just been married in London to a
Melbourne girl—Bessie Tobin. She was a
daughter of the late W. A. Tobin, of Mel-
bourne, and her aunts live at Wingadee,
Balaclava. As is the way of bridegrooms
nowadays, Lord Frederick left almost imme-
diately for the war. His regiment is the
2nd Dragoons, Special Reserve.
Alderman Cabena is to marry the widow
Ellison, of Westbury, St. Kilda, shortly.
Thereafter he will attend to the kerbstone
and other problems of the city with greater
assiduity than ever.
From my Adelaide correspondent: —
The Willunga Railway has started at last. It
opened business officially, after the customary lunch
and speeches, on Wednesday. The new line mean-
ders through some of the prettiest country near
Adelaide, along the coast of the Gulf. It was some
of the first to be settled, but for yeafs past
it has stood still or moved backwards. Now it
is expected confidently that it will leap forward
like a ewe-goat.
A Babies’ Hospital has been started at St.
Peter's. For some time the committee has been
providing the means to nurse sick infants, but it
has only just been able to install itself in premises
■of its own.
E. W. Howard, who came to the State as Private
Secretary to Sir William Robinson, and was after-
wards secretary of the Adelaide Club, has just died.
In 1889 he took to viticulture, and only abandoned
it a few months ago when his heart went wrong.
He married a daughter of the late Dr. Phillips.
The Symons have had word that their son Oliver,
who is serving on the New Zealand in the North Sea,
has been promoted to the rank of acting sub-
lieutenant. The New Zealand was in the Heligoland
fight; and helped to sink the Blucher the other day.
Justice Murray has been casting aspersions on
our juries. During 1914 juries failed to agree in
two out of three civil eases tried in the Supreme
Court, and in 12 criminal cases. While he was
about it he might have mentioned counsel. The
fashion in which they waste time when the parties
concerned have plenty of money to pay their fees is
absolutely audacious.
Daphne, eldest daughter of the J. F. Moores, of
Mount Barker, is engaged to Graham, son of the late
J. G. Young, of Clare. She is a Stow on her mother’s
side— a grand-daughter of a former Advertiser
editor.
The musical Winsloe-Halls are staying at Bal-
hannah with the Girdlestones. Mrs. MacMillan and
her daughter are also away from town.
Theatregoers who delight in seeing stage
people in their more human moments were
entertained the other night when a usually-
sweet pantomime lady “rounded” on one of
the comedians. The high-spirited gentleman
had evidently succeeded in getting on her
nerves, and when at the close of the show,
while the whole company was taking its
call, he seized the train of the lady’s dress
and threw it over her head, she swung
round, stamped her foot, and proceeded to
make some remarks to him out of the Old
Testament. The remarks were not audible,
but her manner, the funny man’s crushed
appearance, and the hurried descent of the
curtain were all very eloquent.
I trust I am not old-fashioned, but I have
always regarded statistics as just a trifle
vulgar. At the same time I am yearning
to tell you of what a friend has dug out
of Knibbs’s Year 800k —G. H. Knibbs, you
know, is the plump, distinguished-looking
little man with the beautiful white hair,
who always makes Governors and sucli-like
persons whom he receives at the Repertory
Theatre look so bourgeois. What was I
saying? Oh, yes, the fact I was about to
reveal when my penultimate sentence be-
came lost in .admiration for Mr. Knibbs, is
that, during the last live years, the age at
which maternity has been most frequent is
slightly over 19 years and three months!
And yet, as I suppose you have noticed,
nobody one knows ever seems to dream of
having a child before 28 or thereabouts. It
only shows what extraordinary things are
done by people one doesn’t know.
Leading British authors and artists have
made a Gift Book for Princess Mary. This
the Princess has had published at half a
crown a copy to help the Work-for-Women
Fund. Barrie contributes a story; so do
Rider Haggard (the farmer with the huge
laugh who explored Australia the other
day and refused to even mention his books)
and Kipling, and Conan Doyle and Beatrice
Harraden. The Bishop of London supplies
an account of his camp life. One of the
Government Houses has an advance copy
already.
Our old friend Victor Hood made a gallant
attempt to get to the war, but failed. “It
is a Young Man’s war,” he says, regretfully.
The authorities, both Naval and Military,
turned up their noses at his age—which is
52 —despite the fact that he has 84 years_ of
rough and tumble life (ranching in Mexico,
gentleman-helping in Australia, and so on)
behind him.
The cult of the lapdog seems to be
menaced in Britain. Anyhow there are
distinct signs of the uprising of a bird craze.
At a London show last month, one exhibit
from an aristocratic home consisted of two
humming birds in separate cages. Each
cage had its own special furnace-heater,
was lined with moss, and was supplied with
fresh orchids and other tropical, heavy-
scented flowers daily, They won’t eat the
honey, which is their chief food, from any
dinner service but orchids. If they are very
hungry they will sometimes consume sponge
cake crumbs and a costly patent baby-food.
The slump in frocky entertainments has
separated crowds of London Sassiety re-
porters from their jobs. Many of them have
gone in for dressmaking on novel lines.
Being accustomed to give advice about rest-
gowns and fascinating breakfast jackets,
etcetera, they have started “creating” trap-
pings suitable for war times and diminished
incomes. Some design and some sew and
some embroider; and they sell their wares in
a sort of communistic shop in the West End.
The J. A. Davidsons, of Niagawou, Oak-
leigh, are giving a garden pantomime on
the evening of January 30. It stands out,
boldly as a party that is not “in aid of”
a blessed thing. It is simply a spree
offered in the hope that the lucky partici-
pants may forget serious things for the
moment. A rider is added to the invita-
tions that if the weather be wet, the revels
will be automatically postponed to February
Ist.
The ennobled nurses of Old England con-
tinue relentlessly to seek a bubble reputa-
tion at the cannon’s mouth. Lately there
was a flutter in the dining-room of the Ritz
in Paris when an expensively apparelled
“Sister” floated up to a table and began
hostilities on the menu. This humble ser-
vant of the wounded,- it turned out, was the
Duchess of Westminster. Her calling was
hinted at by a-large diamond cross hung on
a gold chain or hawser.
Odiva, the cute little Samoan seal-imita-
tor, has invited amateur competitors. So
far only meii have” braved the embarrass-
ments of her tank. Now Hugh Mclntosh men-
tions that silk bathing-gowns of an alluring
sort are waiting for worthy feminine figures,
and the resulting rush of girls should be
great. Odiva’s movements are wondrously
seal-like. She glides in and out of the
water with scarcely a ripple. Not so her
oafish male rivals. In the course of her
Mermaid’s Prayer stunt the slim Samoan
kneels in mid-water, resting seemingly on
nothing, and folds her hands in a devotional
manner, while her hair floats in a graceful
swirl about her head. To see this turn
imitated by a lanky furniture-remover, with
cellar flap ears and feet like fenders, is to
witness what should be withheld from the
eyes of aesthetes.
The event of the other evening was sup-
plied by the seal-tamer. In the immaculate
evening costume of a gentleman, or waiter,
he pranced round the rocky edge of the
tank, goading or cheering on the splashing
youths to victory. The too-violent sup-
pression of a curse, or something, made him
lose his balance and plunge into the tank.
The Rickards circuit never had such a sen-
sation. If a genuine accident of the sort
could only be put on every night the house
would end. by bursting.
Marshall Hall is close at hand. To
slightly paraphrase Bright, I can almost
hear the rustle of his music-leaves. He
will be here soon with the rush and the fuss
and the stage-thunder that are characteris-
tic of him. Meanwhile Dr. Barrett, his
patron saint, sits with a beatific smile and
waits like Martha.
Ruby Glover, now Mrs. Godfrey Garrick,
has come back with her complexion unim-
paired after three years of Fiji. Anyone
who doubts can go and inspect her at St.
Kilda, where she is staying for the dog-
days.
Edna Smibert, of Hawthorn, is engaged
to Norman Robinson. Norman is not
merely rich; he is a brother to Lionel, whose
head is alleged to be valued by the Kaiser at
£lOOO. There would be a rush for the £lOOO
on the part of Britain’s German spies only
the impression lias got abroad that the
Kaiser means to pay either by cheque or by
Deutsche Bank notes. In the circumstances
the risk is felt to be hardly worth while.
To get back to the Robinsons, they are both
grandsons of old A. P>. Robinson, who was
the commercial authority on the Age up to
the time of his death some years ago.
The Ronald Watt-Madge Clarke affair
occurs on February 1.
Captain Burnham was still in hospital,
being nursed by his wife, when the last mails
left. He is not injured to any extent. The
trouble concerns his nerves, which have
been shattered into small pieces by the noise
and peril and general horror of life at the
front. Captain Buchanan, another ex-aide,
who married pretty Muriel Cumming, of
these parts, is being patched up for further
campaigning at the Cheshire home of Lady
Grey-Egerton. The latter, who used to be
Rupert Clarke’s wife, is the wounded hero’s
sister-in-law.
Yours sincerely,
JOHANNA.
The nation which puts trading interests
before the urgent appeals of the Goddess of
Right relapses from that high standard of
international morality inspired by the spirit
of greatness and King George IV. topnotch
Scotch.*
“Made in Australia” is going to be a booming
trade fixture when the enemy’s dogs of war cease to
bark and bite. In the meanwhile, Queensland, like
other States in the Commonwealth, keeps abreast of
the times. In the sound quality of its home-made
goods, and the attractive manner in which it adver-
tises them, Pike Bros,, of Brisbane, Townsville and
Toowoomba, show the right brand of commercial
patriotism. Their latest catalogue is an illustrated
volume rather than a sale list. It also plunges into
the sample business, and the astounded reader can
finger tiny fragments of material that like
limpets to the printed page. Seeing is believing.
Even doubting Thomas had faith in that which he
could touch. Ask Pike Bros, to forward this tome
of trade information, and judge for yourself the high
standard that “Made in Australia” has already
attained. *


DEWARS
THE THREE GREAT TESTS
OF GOOD WHISKY ARE
QUALITY—TASTE—AGE
Quality is the Essence of Goodness and Fine
Blending. It conveys that indefinable distinc-
tion, which makes a man a prince among his
fellows, and Dewar’s a king among Whiskies.
Excellence in Distillation is a Science; Pre-
eminence in Blending an Art. Dewar’s is a
Mingling of Choice Spirits. Quality stands for
Character, and Dewar’s for the ideal com-
bination of both.
Taste. The Taste of Dewar’s is the Golden
Key which unlocks all the pleasant avenues
of the memory. In Dewar’s Whisky there is
something creamy and yet not cloying;
something velvety and yet not heating;
something rich and yet not obtrusive; some-
thing crisp and yet not crude Strong and yet
gentle, Dewar’s is the Paladin of Whiskies.
Age is the Crowning Stage in a series of fer-
mentations. Fermentation means Life. Age
dissipates its roughness, rounds off its edges,
and refines its character, leaving nothing
behind but the Rarest Elixir of Life. Dewar’s
is the Veteran of Stimulants.. It is ripe for
Promotion to your Palate.

WHISKY.
A UNIFORM STANDARD of QUALITY.
ABORIGIN-
ALITIES
Honolulu Museum, which specialises in
curiosities connected with the South Seas, is to be
presented with an idol made of wood and alleged to
be related to Captain Cook. This graven image was
one Of four which guarded the burial temple of Poly-
nesian kings ruling at Hawaii in the long-ago. In
this temple Cook’s body was temporarily placed after
the murder, and his spirit was definitely associated
with the above-mentioned god. Subsequently, Bloxam,
a naturalist on H.M.S. Blonde, obtained possession
of it and took it to England in 1826 ; and now his
son, A. R. Bloxam, of Christchurch (M.L.j, returns
it to its old island home.
TRUE OPTIMISM.
THE PESSIMIST: “ Beastly weather, this! It's
just about the limit."
THE OPTIMIST: “Oh, I don't know! It's
better than none at all."
The extraordinary season in South Aus.
promises to bring along a small crop of out-of-
season wheat. Some northern districts got practi -
cally no rain till the end of November. Then there
was a flood ; after which the grain did some untimely
germinating, and is now promising a three- or tour-
bushel crop two or three month-- her re.
“W.S.N.”: Will the freshwater crayfish
expert stand up and answer these questions: What's
the best method of cooking the beast? What is its
natural food? What size does it attain (the beast,
not the food)? Who or what is the insect that
abounds on the Cray's body ? What is the best method
of capturing brother cray? That’ll be all to-day.
“Outcast” : Most Papuans’ great liking for
dog extends eveh to the table. Up the Fly River
there are several tribes which make a speciality of
breeding tucker dogs for sale to the villages lower
down. One breeder I saw had a herd of about 40 of
these cattle worth about a tomahawk apiece. Suffra-
«gette dogs are in great demand; but they must
always be flappers, a grown bird being of no use to
the buyer. Years ago I was up the Waria, and had
no end of trouble to prevent my Mamba carriers
from bagging every dog they set eyes on. I don’t
think there is any special breed of Waria dogs ; they
seem to be just plain dingo with a dash of something.
When you come to think it over there’s a dash of
something in everything.
x- * *
“Flinderin'o” : I went boating up the Mul-
gravc River (N.Q.) recently, and was surprised to
find the stream comparatively free from crocodiles.
Things were different 15 years ago. I was then
aboard a small steam dug-out in the banana and
log-timber trade, and in the Mulgrave we used to
find the crocodiles so numerous as to be a menace to
navigation. One sunny morning our craft took the
ground just inside the river entrance. The sandbanks
teemed with crocodiles basking in the sun. But our
skipper knew what to do. He gave an unearthly
shriek with the steam-whistle which sent the swarm
of ’diles ’ell for leather into the stream. The water
rose 4ft. and lifted our boat clear of the bottom. We
then resumed the voyage.
-X- * * *
“A.C.H.” : I will back the Farina-Inna-
mincka and Hergott Springs-Birdsville tracks to be
the most camel-trodden in the Commonwealth. Prac-
tically all south-western Queensland gets its supplies
from Farina and Hergott, and as a carrier the camel
pushed the horse off the road some 16 years ago. In
1004 I saw 30 bull camels come into Birdsville with
15 tons of stuff, the heavyweight of the string
carrying 12cwt. For years the Beltana Pastoral Co.
has bred the humped beasts in a large way on Mount
Lyndhurst and Murnpeowie stations, and it is a
common sight to see camels, horses, mules, donkeys
and sheep drinking at troughs together. In 1910 1
saw 150 camels, in charge of white men, waiting at
Cordillo Downs to take away the co.’s wool.
“Vigilans” (B. 17/12/’!4) errs when he says camels
do not care for grass. They are just as partial to
it as horses, but they like it green. Some years ago
I was in charge of a string belonging to the Mitchell
Rabbit Board, and thoiigh the beasts saw no water
for three months they secured plenty of moisture
from grass, weeds and herbage. The reason camels
do not take on in the Gulf and the Territory is the
prevalence of a very poisonous weed there. They
seem to relish the flavor of it, but they turn up
their pads in a very short time after a gorge.
* * * *
“Paddy-Melon”: I believe what is known
as the Birdsville horse disease is peculiar to the
lower Diamantina country. It is prevalent chiefly in
dry times, and occasionally reaches serious dimen-
sions. Out there neither the cause nor a cure has as
yet been discovered. A horse may, to all appear-
ances, be fit and well in the morning, and by midday
may suddenly collapse, struggle in agony for, per-
haps half an hour, and then pass out. The victims
may go through several fits before finally throwing
a seven. Once affected very few survive, and those
that do survive are practically useless afterwards,
owing, to weakness in the loins and hind legs. It is
easy to kill a horse that has had a touch of “Birds-
ville.” A remarkable thing about the disease is that
it is only on sandy country that it prevails. On the
“gibber” country you rarely meet with it. It is
nothing for 50 horses or more to be wiped out on one
cattle station on the Lower Diamantina in a season,
and at one place in S. Aus. as many as 200 odd suf-’
fering prads died in 12 months.
"The Reefer”: This is a translation of
what the New Hebrides boy told me after his initia-
tion :—-
I and two other candidates, after being secluded
and starved for a moon, were taken into the midst
of a great concourse of the elect in front of a
r/amal (a long, narrow and low. grass-thatched
structure on stilts). It was the club-house of the
society. Leaves of the lealolo (stinging tree) de-
pended thickly from the low roof. I crooked my
knees and stumbled along under them, right through
to the other end. Then they dashed saltwater over
me, and I fainted with the agony of the stinging
prickles. 1 never felt such pain. For two days food and
drink were withheld. Then a man made a little depres-
sion in the ground with a heel, into which cocoanut
juice was poured for me to drink : and an uncooked'
portion of the pig (given to the society by my
brother on my account) was permitted me. Ail
the food was mixed up on the bare ground with
ashes and dung. If 1 refused to eat I would have
been put to death. One day we were compelled to
carry burning embers in our naked hands. Fine
splinters of bamboo were pressed info our shoulders,
buttocks, hips, elbows and even into the soles of the
feet, so that, however we lay or stood, there could
be no respite from the torment of the festering. If
an old man saw us lying down he’d run over our
bodies and leap on us. Frequently someone would
seize his bow and send an arrow whizzing close to
one or other of us. Later on, wo were taught the
complicated dance and songs of the society, and how
to make the grotesque masks. When we were judged
proficient, we had to remain a further 30 days’ cook-
ing for the other members in the c/amal. Now we
arc privileged to make things taboo and share in the
lodge's orgies.
NOT A KISS.
MRS. PROBITT: “I heard him behind the door pleading for 'just one. They must be
engaged."
MR. P.: “No, they're married. It was a shilling he was pleading for."
“Retlaw” : There never was a drought in
Riverina (NT.S.W.) like this one, and, though we’ve
had patchy showers, it isn’t over yet. Emus are
still prospecting for grub in streets of towns where
usually you had to go 20 miles out to find an odd
one. Hunger has tamed the crows, and galahs and
cockatoos parade in the daylight. A township on the
Murrumbidgee that usually supports three parsons is
row lamenting its sins without the benefit of any
clergy whatever. The crop of thrip’nies has failed
with every other crop. The school-teacher now reads
the burial service when required, and if there are any
mad persons who desire to take on housekeeping they
must interview the C.P.S. and get their license from
him.
“Retlaw” : A nevvchum in the Never Never
is quickly introduced to a two-rail fence covered with
sand past the top rail, and is solemnly informed that
the heaping-up was done by the wind in a few years.
To which he says “Liar!” If the newelium had been
in Balranald (N.S.W.j for the week December 27 to
January 2 he would believe anything in that time.
A gentle breeze zephyred from Monday to Friday,
not even knocking off for smoko, and taking no
notice of Wages Boards’ awards respecting holidays.
A full quarter-inch of dust covered all floors every
morning. And this with a fine windbreak along the
river! Out of the township numerous acres went
floating away up north, and parts Victoria came
across in their place. Woodheaps turned into sand-
hills. Gates were sanded up to a height of two or
three feet. Crab-holes 2ft. deep and full of water
were turned into hillocks; irrigation channels were
filled up, small grass roots volunteered for the war
and made tracks for Brisbane, and from the large
roots sand-rills spread out three or four yards to
leeward. By the way, how does this five-days’ blow
run for the long-distance dust-storm championship ?
“Vic”: Outside the army of the Imperial
Swineherd wild animals are dirt cheap; and zoo
authorities are keeping their eyes peeled. Elephants,
lions, tigers, bunyips, sea-sarpints, eynocephaluses
and all the other things have gone down 80 per
cent, pro tern., with owners anxious to realise. 1
expect that when the Kaiser is flattened out the
matchless treasures of Hagenbeck, in Hambug, will
be available for a song, if they haven’t been eaten.
Meanwhile, the Melbourne Zoo has just secured, for
a trifle over £lOOO, the following extraordinary
catalogue of beasts: An African rhinoceros, said to
be the only one in Australia, others having come
from India; a young African elephant ; pair of
Livingstone elands, or antelopes (it is believed they
could be acclimatised in North Australia ; they breed
enormously, form a food supply, and thrive where
cattle couldn't) ; a fine pair of black-maned lions;
some young African leopards and jackals ; giant owls,
handsome cranes, two hornbills, two vultui'es; a pair
of splendid Barbary sheep, and a pair of Sardinian
wild sheep with their young; a lot of monkeys ; and,
to put Eve’s tempter last, a 12ft. python.
MISSING LAND MARKS,
THE MAN FROM OUTBACK: “By cripes, Cap-
tain, hord'd, per find the track? There
ain’t even a post or rail in sight."
THE HEROES.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
When on the following day volunteers were called
for to go on this risky beer-fetching expedition the
whole column stepped out of the ranks. — War item.
Said the garrison sergeant-major as he tilted his
empty glass:
“The bravest thing as ever I see was done by a corps
en marse.''
“Tell me the story, Sergeant,” I said, “for I’d like
to hear ;
But ere you begin, perhaps you’d like to sample
another beer?”
“Talkin’ of beer reminds me,” said the garrison
sergeant-major,
“Of the finest, thing I ever did see at a place called
Somethin’-Ager.
“Good ’ealth ! Ah, that was in—let me see? —the
’orrible Europe war,
When I was a corporal, years ago, in the Army Ser-
vice Corps.
“We'd all been marchin’ and fightin’, and marchin’
and swearin' ’ard ;
'Strewth ! we was tired and sleepy ; and thirsty ! As
dry as lard 1
“We ’its old Somethin’-Ager in the ’eat of a August
day—
And August weather in Europe is genuine ’of, so to
say.
“The Germans ’ad been a-bombardin’ old Ager for
days an’ days,
Till the bloomin’ place was a brickfield gone mad in
a ’undred ways ;
“There was town 'alls, mansions and churches with
steeples that swayed an’ fell,
But the saddest sight of the lot, sir, was the brewery,
flamin’ like Hell!
“We went as near as we dared to, an’ that wasn’t
over-near;
Well, I don't mind if I do, sir ; there’s times when a
man needs a beer.;
“And this was one of them times, all right; we was
well-nigh mad with thirst,
And there wasn’t a pint of water in Ager ; the pipes
’ad burst 1
“But our colonel —what a soldier ’e was! Just did
a little think,
And ’e made us a speech which ended with: ‘Boys,
there’s beer to drink.’
“Did wc worry about the churches, or try to put out
the town ’all?
Not much ! "We just rallied round, quick-like, at
the good old canteen call.
“ ‘ ’Oo says beer?' And we all did! And when the
colonel ’e ’ears
E cries: ‘l am proud of you, lads! Now, which of
you volunteers?’
“It was just like a thunder of voices the answer the
regiment made:
‘We all do!’.... And, s’elp me, we all stepped out
like on parade !
“Not one dashed rooky was backward, and the
colonel’s eyes were wet;
And we ’eard ’im murmur: ‘By Heaven, the grand
old spirit lives yet!’
“Did we save the brewery, mister? Well, no; nor
the church that was near ;
The brewery was burnt to cinders, but we managed
to save the beer!”
N.SAV.
R. McGEDDON.
“Billy Bowyang”: A fallacy widely pre-
vails concerning the giant c-lani of the Great Bander
Reef. It is conimo dr stated in works on natural his-
tory that the animal is attached to the coral rock
by a ligament so strong that an axe is required to
release it from its moorings. As a matter of fact,
these clams possess no anchoring ligament, but lie
entirely free on the surface of the reef. It is the
smaller spotted or bear's-foot clam, the more ornate
frilled or furbelow specimen, that is permanently
attached. From the references made to this species
in natural-history works and accounts of voyages of
discovery, it has clearly been mistaken for the young
of its gigantic relative. Under the title of “Gigantic
Cockles” the Barrier Reef clams were first recorded
by Captain Cook, who says they made excellent eat-
ing. I once attempted to devour some of the cooked
flesh, but after struggling with it decided to leave it
to the coastal Binghi, who considers it a head-liner
in his menu.

The Adelaide Register (7/1/T5) has

“J. 0.8.” : New Year’s gift to the IlaAvkes-
burj' (N.S.W.) was another flood in the river. AVind-
sor Bridge was under water on January 1. Other
countries have retrospects of wars and earthquakes,
but “the Oxberry” records its history by its flood
marks. It began demonstrating immediately after
the white man arrived. In 1800 it foamed at the
mouth and swept people, stock, crops and houses
away. The rescue exploits of some of the ancients of
the time are as thrilling as the feats which Avin the
Victoria Cross. One hero they tell you about, Thomp-
son, saved over 100 persons from crazy rafts and
perilous housetops. The Government in those early
days took an active part in helping the survivors
to begin anew by serving out seed wheat and pur-
chasing the next crops at remunerative figures. Since
then the region has prospered, until it ranks to-day
among the most productive of Australia.
* * * *
“W.D.”: In the Fish River country and
round about the main dividing range near Hampton
(N.S.AV.) a reward is to be put on the head of the
poor old wombat. His family-tree has its roots in
the Pleistocene age, and it is about the only tree we
haven’t destroyed. The indictment against him at
Hampton alleges that “in some places netted fences
had been burrowed under and torn up.” He is a
typical marsupial, and the Australian branch of the
world-wide badger family. His motto is a quiet life
for everybody. So much so that he only comes out to
take the air at nights, and nobody is even certain
what he eats. So rarely is he seen that Tregarthen,
an authority, mentions as a great occurrence that he
“once caught a glimpse of a badger stealing over a
cairn in the grey of early dawn.” The job of his
Australian enemies will be to get at him. liis
“earth” is so deep and so endlessly complicated that
it would be cheaper to repair miles of fencing than
to dig him out. As a sixteenth century writer puts
it: “Having once reached his fortress he gives the
fico to all that his adversaries can attempt against
him.” Terriers are his worst foes. They follow him
below ground, but they die young. All sorts of yarns
circulate about his mysterious battle-methods under
the earth. He undoubtedly has a knack either of
selecting earth that is liable to subsidence, or of so
arranging- it that a slide occurs, and all the animals
are buried together. By the way, April, May and
June are not “the best months” for destruction, as
stated by the Hampton inspector. “Once in a year
they engender as the fox in the spring,” and this is
the moment when terriers may really have a chance
with the litter. Incidentally they invented the Old
Age Pension .system. “They live long, and when
they are old then some of them fall blind, and can-
not come forth of their holes. Then if it be the
badgers the sowes feed them, and if it be the sowe,
the badger feedeth her likewise.”
NOT A FAVORITE.
SPORT: “ Well, Bill, how's things?”
BILL: "I’ve got lumbago.”
S PORT: "I Must be an outsider. Didn’t know
it was running.”
“Biddy B.”: Re that new arrangement
(“San,” B. 14/1/’l5) that tears up the subsoil to a
depth of 18in. and pulverises it completely. Per-
haps it does —on Coogee beach or some other soft,
sandy spot where you can poke a stick down a couple
of feet. But has “San,” or any other agricultural
expert, ever tried it in the heavy clay of the Bland
or some parts of the Riverina, where after a dry
spell it takes you all your time to punch a posthole
down 18in. with a crowbar? If he hasn’t, let him
stick to cultivating seaweed on a sandy beach. I’d
try it up here (Wyalong), but I’ve only got 16
working horses, and I doubt if they’d shift it.
EXPENSIVE.
J ERRY: “ Ullo, Bill. Thai’s a nice overcoat you’ve got. What did it cost?”
BILL (hurriedly): “'Old yer noise. It'll cost me six months if the cops ’ear yer.”
“Tiaki” : I-lenare had many peculiar ways
of dealing with disease—some of them based on
scientific principles, though he didn’t know it. For
mamae-tuara (lumbago) the patient lay flat on his
stomach while 12 or 14 stone of barefooted brother
paraded up and down his backbone. Modern doctors
pi escribe massage, which is gentler, but has
the same effect. Lately I saw a burly half-caste who
had hastily concealed the blade of an axe in his foot.
Meri, who was cooking in the camp, made a poultice
of young manuka shoots (Leptospermum scoparium )
by chewing them until they were reduced to a pulp.
With this she plugged up the gash and then ban-
daged the hoof. In two weeks she ordered the
patient to unbandage, and, in less time than it took
to construct the universe, the bushwhacker was again
at yakker.
Flynn’s Dog Story.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Dargan was wan convarsant wid

way a dog would give his respects t’ Ben
Dargan, ’n’ him nothin’ at all ye’d look at

BUSH TEACHER : "My brother is coming up
from Sydney for a holiday , if he can get
away. He wants a rest badly; he has too
much work to do,”
BUSHMAN: “ What’s he workin ’ at?”
BUSH TEACHER : “ He's in the General Post
Office.”
BUSHMAN : “I suppose he'll have a bit of a
job to get anybody to mind the office while
he’s away.”
severity, ‘ ’tis a bor-rn liar,’ he sez. ‘Will
yeh be shtill, yeli lollopin’ perjurer ’n’ nre-
varicator?’ sez he. 1
“The dog was visibly depressed. He
skulked towar-rds the corner, ’n’ ‘Don’ be
har-rd on me,’ he sez.
“ ‘That’s very well,’ sez Dargan. ‘but
there’s nothin’ out there fer a dog knows his
juty t’ bar-rk at, nothin’ whatever, V tis
vanity,, ’n’ consate, ’n’ mere tomfoolishness
yer doin’ it. Is ut the troot I’m tellin’ yeh
—is ut?’
“ ‘ ’Tis the whole troot ’n’ nothin’ but,’ sez
the dog wid meekness ’n’ submission, ‘ ’n’ I
hope yell’ll not be too har-rd on a poor hound
wid shmall trainin’ ’n’ no edjikation t’ slipeak
of, Misther Dargan, sir.’ Then he crep’
unther the for-rm, ’n’ lay there wid wan eye
on Ben the whole night, ’n’ not annother
wor-rd out iv him.
“Ye’ll bilave me, maybe, but afther the
second exposure that dog, though he pre-
sarved his gen’ral charactheristics wid others,
niver again attimpted t’ impose on anny one
when Ben was convayint. The second
public exposure kim about the afthernoon
next whin Tater was lyin’ befure the bar-r
dure, choppin’ flies.
“ “Dthrop it, you, will yell?’ sez Ben.
‘Craven,’ lie sez, ‘yer dog’s a liar.’
‘Thrue for yeh, no doubt,’ sez Craven.
‘But a man have no great nade iv the vartue
iv truthfulness in a dog. Let dogs lie,’ sez
he, ‘ ’tis a proverb. Manewhile Tater will
hunt down ’n’ kill more flies in wan hour
than anny dog his size in this place ’r the
next.’
“ ‘He will not,’ sez Dargan. ‘ ’Tis a
erim’nal imposition, nothin’ else. He’s im-
posin’ on yer good nature Avid a rascally
pritince.’
“ ‘Well,* sez Craven, ‘tin pound I’ll give
yeh fer a dog will hunt flies more adroitly.’
“‘Yeh will?’ sez Ben.
“ ‘This day,’ sez Craven.
“ ’Tis never a har-rd mather fer Dargan
t’ put his hand on a dog. He dives in a
pocket, ’n’ pulls out one trimblin’ tan terrier
never a ha’porth bigger ’n a nine days’
kitten, ’n’ s£z he, ‘Here’s a mastiff,’ he sez,
‘will hunt down ’n’ kill more flies ’n’ fleas in
wan hour than yer moral imposhter would
yar-rd up in a month.’
“Was a competition arranged for right
away, Tim Harrigan timekeeper, ’n’ meself
referee ’n’ holder iv the shtake. But there
was nothin’ in ut but Dargin’s tan terrier.
He wint from the jump, ’n’ was tossin’ him-
self all over the bar-r, shnappin’ flies wid
nateness ’n’ dispatch. He had a fly while
Tater was lookin’ at ut ’n’ makin’ up his
mind ’twas not a beetle. ’N’ then the terrier
jumped fer Craven, ’n’ went fussin’ all troo
the man’s clothes. ‘Lave him alone, will
yeh!’ sez Dargan, ‘ ’tis a shtray flea ye’ll
have about you, Michael.’
“Be this Tater had fallen out iv the hunt,
V crep’ away t’ hide unther the bar-rn.
But did the poor, base-bor-rn crature hold
it up agin Ben at all fer these exposures iv
his unworthiness. Mark what I’m tellin’
yeh. Ben, who be this was well acquaint
wfld ev’ry dog fer a mile wan way ’r the
other, tuck a bit iv a conthrac’ t’ cut shleep-
ers fer Cameron over the hill ’n’ beyant, ’n’
wan afthernoon it occurred t’ Craven ez a
quare thing Dargan was neglectin’ his
dthrinkin’. He remarked on it in me own
presence. Then two dogs kim in ’n’ made
a demonstration which we’d nayther iv us
the sinse t’ undershtand.
“Subsequent t’ this two dogs called et
Cameron’s, ’n’ wan terrier iv Irish ixtrac-
tion tore the shkirts off Nora Dwyer, thryin’
t' tow her afther him in the intherests iv
Ben Dargan. ’Tis a sad reflection on the
intellect iv the dishtrict, but the conthrary
’n’ onexpected manoeuvres iv the community
iv dogs had shmall iffcct fer one day ’n’ a
ha’f, when Finney tuck it t’ his head t’
folly a large Cochin-China dog iv Cadbury’s
was raisin’ triminjis lamentations in his
yar-rd. The dog took Finney straight t’
where Dargan lay be a tree in the Shtate
forest wid a score iv dogs shtandin’ guar-rd.
“There was the tree fell on Dargan, ’n’
there was the limb pinned him ’n’ the hole
scraped t’ clear him. Ben’s two ribs was
bruk chine in two, ’n’ bis leg moreover.
He told me the tale in the hospital war-rd,
how the tree fell on him, ’n’ the limb twist
across him he couldn’t move a flit. ’Twas
Cadbury’s dog found him, ’n’ Cadbury’s dog
wint off ’n’ told annother dog iv liis ac-
quaintance, ’n’ the two come ’n’ made affec-
tionit inquiries, then wan went ’n’ told
Tater ’n’ Scanlan’s cow hound ; ’n’ eventual
Ileeley’s poodle ’n’ all the neighborin’ dogs
got busy.
“Sez Ben : ‘There wasn’t a dog in the
dishtric’ didn’t come t’ see me ’n’ condole
wid me, ’n’ ev’ryone thried t’ bring man ’r
child, wan sinseless spaniel aven doin’ his
best t’ dthrag off a baby girl iv three frim
Crowther’s back yar-rd, I’m told. But I’ll
say this fer Tater,’ sez he, ‘he showed him-
self a dog iv great industhry ’n’ intelligence
the like I’d not give him credit fer. While
the others was tearin’ over the counthry
wid the news ’twas him stayed by me six-
teen long hours and dug me out!’ ”

Take Sanatogen
It's sure to give you
Better Health, Strength
and Nerve-power.
If you are in need of a
tonic, nothing will do you
so much goo i as a course
of Sanatogen.
Whether you are only a
little weak and run down,
or suffering from some
definite disorder of nerves,
digestion or nutrition—
there is no doubt that a
course of Sanatogen will
be of real and lasting
benefit to you.
Remarkable Statements by
Famous Men and Women.
Start that course of Sanatogen
to-day. You won’t have to wait
long to feel the good of it. Never
mind if you are a little sceptical
now. Only give Sanatogen a fair
trial, and you will soon be con-
vinced, enthusiastic !
‘ ‘ Sceptical as I was, ’ ’ writes
Sir William Bull, M.P., “I am
bound to say that Sanatogen per-
forms what it promises to do.
It has a wonderfully restorative
effect.”

“It is only fair to say,” writes Sir Alexander
Cross, Bart., “ that I have been surprised at the
results of Sanatogen. They have been just what
was predicted—a material increase in vigour and
pli3 7 sical fitness.”
Again, Mr. Arnold Bennett, the leading
novelist and playwright (author of “Milestones,”
“The Old Wives’ Tale,” etc.), writes: “The
tonic effect of Sanatogen on me is simply
wonderful.” And Mrs. Kensington, wife of
Mr. Justice Kensington, Lahore, India, writes :
“ I and Mr. Kensington have tried Sanatogen,
and have both found it a wonderful reviver and
tonic. It is also the best cure for digestive
troubles that I have come across.”
Let Sanatogen improve your Health.
Such statements —typical of thousands of
others—cannot fail to impress even a prejudiced
reader. For they were sent voluntarily by
shrewd men and women, of high character and
position—not at all the sort of people to be
carried away by facile enthusiasms, or to be
deceived by illusory sensations of benefit.
Will you do as they did? Will you, in fair-
ness to your own health, give Sanatogen a
thorough trial ?
Write to-day for a Free Booklet.
Simply drop a post-card, mentioning this paper,
to The Sanatogen Co., 17 Bond Street, Sydney,
N.S.W. They will send you, free, an interesting
booklet, called “How to Live Healthily/’ which
tells you all about Sanatogen.
Afterwards, a regular course of Sanatogen (sold
by all Chemists from 2/6 per tin), will cost you
about sevenpence a day—not a “speculation,” but
a sound “investment,” yielding you as guaranteed
dividends “a wonderfully restorative effect” and “a
material increase in vigor and physical fitness!”
And there is no risk —Sanatogen cannot hurt you
in any way, and cannot fail to do you good. Take
the first step now —there’s no time like the
present!
Business, Robbery, etc.
“Hamer”: There are many peculiar evi-
dences of the existence of harder times.
The suburban pedlar, who makes a business
of spellbinding people into buying some-
thing altogether useless, is becoming a plague.
Catchpenny devices for gathering in the
tightening currency are springing up every-
where. Nearly every vacant lot in Sydney
has a stall where shies at various things
may bring back coin or goods. Also,
breacli-of-promise cases are rife; and actions
for damages over almost every conceivable
thing. And then there are the bands. In
times of prosperity the people were en-
couraged by a fool crowd of politicians not
to make things themselves but to import
them from Europe. Now. Europe has gone
mad and the people whose livings depended
on the import trade are out of their jobs in
■great numbers, with the result that they
have to make jobs. And a job is a difficult
thing to make out of nothing.
* * *- *
“Gombi” : Bad times may breed cases for
the higher Courts (B. 24/12/T4). but they
certainly have the opposite effect in the
Police and Small Debts Courts. It works
out thuswise : no money, no beer, no tearing
me uniform; or no cash, no can pay fine,
no like gaol, no punch him on the nose, no
get run in. On the petty debts side, trades-
people know it is useless to summon debtors
when they can’t get work. Besides, even if
work isn’t really hard to get, there is always
the chance of somebody or other pointing a
finger at the plaintiff tradesman and asking
him what he means by harassing a citizen
who is sufferin’ for the Empire! And the
tradesman knows there needn’t be an ounce
of sense in such guff to keep customers away
thereafter from his pro-German store.
“8.J.H.0.”: A recent cable mentioned
that Cold Country tanners are suffering
through being unable to obtain tannin
extract, which in the past they have im-
ported mostly from Germany. The German
stuff is made mostly from the hemlock tree,
which yields a very small percentage of
tannin —about 7 or 8 per cent. —whereas
our own silver and black wattle will give
somewhere about 20 per cent., and our golden
wattle anything up to 28 per cent. The
mangrove also yields a good crop of the
acid. The manufacture of the stuff was
started on a small scale in Bananaland
some time ago; but the Gerliog went in for
price-cutting, and Bull, true to his foreign-
trade principle of buying in the cheapest
market, regardless of crimson ties and so
forth, turned us down. Australia now has
a chance to capture a bit yf the German
trade, which is well worth capturing.
* # * *
Adelaide is smiling grimly over a cable
that appeared in London papers of
17/11/T4: “Heavy rains have fallen in
South Australia, benefiting the crops, which
are enormous.” There were some good rains
in the North at that time, but for all that the
harvest is the worst for years. The patchi-
ness of that November downfall prompted
the wail of a squatter of S.A.: “My sheep
were absolutely starving at So-and-So. I
sent them down to Such-and-Sueh, and the
first thing I heard was that 300 of them had
been drowned —in the paddock ! I sent the
rest to Petersburg to be sold, and when I
got there the blighters were standing up to
their necks in water in the saleyards.”
* * * *
“Aristide”: One of the dailies talks of
“spies” in the drapery line. Fashionable
London draperies “are unable to show their
latest styles in the windows, for spies, in
the form of rival firms, abound who will
draw models of them, and so infringe on
their exclusive rights. The models may,
however, be seen inside.” The idea of this
yarn is that the drapery shops deal in
genuine “Paris Models.” The people who
do deal in them are not drapers, and they
don’t have windows. They are firms such as
Beer or Paul Poiret, in Paris; and Paquin,
in London and Paris. They occupy large
private houses —in Paris, mostly in the
Place Vendome. and in London in the
neighborhood of Bond-street. The general
public is not angled for, models are only
shown to known and customary clients, and
anybody else —the alleged “spy” included —
would have less chance of inspecting the real
interior than a fully-uniformed French
artilleryman would have of inspecting the
Cannon Ilall at Krupp’s.
“Manly” : This is the abridged history of
my adventure with the N.S.W. branch of
the postal service :
(1) Wrote to tlie landladv that I desired to ter-
minate my tenancy on the 13th.
(2) Discovered next dav that my calculations had
been wrong, and sent another letter asking for release
on the 6th. Address correct and plainly typed.
(3) Waited patiently one week for advice that the
matter had been arranged in accordance with my
second letter.
(4) Received agitated note that my first letter
(asking for release on the 13th) had arrived safely
and all arrangements had been made. Enclosed was
the plainly-typed envelope ot my second letter show-
ing that a suburban post-office genius, moved by some
strange impulse, had crossed out the correct name
and address (to which the first communication had
been promptly delivered) and had sent it along to a
perfect stranger in the next suburb. Result the
letter had taken seven days to travel seven miles
and find the lady to whom it was plainly addressed.
Of course, like the reprieve in the pathetic prison
ballad, it had arrived too late.
If the diverted letter had been about any-
thing less prosaic than rent, I might have
been savage with the Deputy I’.M.G. As it
was only rent, I merely wrote and asked him
if he could let the superfluous house to one
of his postmen. Ido hope he finds a tenant
for me and saves me the £2 10s. I’ll other-
wise have to part with.
* -X* -X- *
“Y.Z.”: My friend Carter has had a queer
experience with his man-servant and his
maid-servant, the story of which should go
into print for the instruction of other influ-
ential householders who may be about to
engage servants in sets. Carter wanted a
man to root in the garden, and a maid to
do the same in the kitchen, and was glad to
get the two in one, so to speak. The maiden
end was something of a stunner, and she
promised to submit her husband, the male
half, that evening. The brace was con-
sidered suitable on inspection, and proceeded
to make itself at home. It resided with
Carter for one night in the character of man
and wife. In the morning it left early
by the back way out, and never returned.
Carter called at the registry-office for ex-
planation. and the refund of certain fees.
The registry-office keeper refunded, and ad-
mitted that she had been distressed with
doubts. Her subsequent inquiries have
brought to light seven complaining house-
holders, each of whom had on various occa-
sions recently engaged the same girl as the
female section of a married couple. The
girl always attended, and always left next
morning, and the husband end of the arrange-
ment was a different man each time! This
seems to point to the fact that, as a result
of war and drought, economy is necessary
even in the most ancient profession for
ladies.
* * * *■
“C.E.”: London, with 7,252,963 people,
annually uses 130 electric units per head.
New York, with 4,754,000. uses 360; Chi-
cago. with 2,185,283, uses 425; Boston, with
1,951,907. uses 400; Detroit, with 570,000.
uses 330; Melbourne, with 628,430, uses
only 42. The variations in price are still
more astonishing. The cost per unit in
Melbourne is 3.5 d., on an average; in Lon-
don. 2.29 d.; in Boston, 2.7 d.; New York,
2.6 d.; Detroit, 1.43 d.; Berlin. 1.7 c!.; Chi-
cago. I.OOd. Melbourne’s system is hap-
hazard. The Melbourne Supply Co. has a
grip on the outer districts, and its tentacles
are growing. The City Council Electric Supply
attends to Melbourne proper, but nowadays
is not much interested in reducing lighting
charges. The Government has its own
Spencer-street power house. The suburban
railway electrification scheme will have its
own power house at Newport. So, one way
and another. Melbourne has 24 generating
systems. Paris, Berlin, Hamburg, Boston
and Chicago have each only one. In Lon-
don there are 65 cos., shindykits and
private sharks supplying electricity, 49 sys-
tems of supply, 70 generating stations, and
585 engines. This leads, as in Melbourne,
to waste, expense and inefficiency. In 1906
an attempt by the companies to concentrate
was defeated by the County Council. In
1907 an attempt by the Council was de-
feated by the companies. In 1908 and 1910,
under the Electric Supply Act, the Council
obtained the right of acquiring all —in 1931!
Here, in Melbourne, we haven’t even got
the advantage of a County Council; and the
present waste and confusion must grow
worse with every year that a Greater Mel-
bourne remains unborn.
“P.II.”: The turmoil over last season’s
deficient wheat crop is merely so much noise
in favor of State granaries. When cereals
are abundant and cheap. State Governments
should buy at current prices and store in the
producing districts enough to supply the
home demand for a year at least, holding it
until market rates exceed a specified
standard, and then selling for local
consumption at cost, including interest and
expenses. This would leave the then current
harvest available for export and sale at high
prices in foreign markets. _ Reckoning
interest and cost of administration at o per
cent., wheat bought at 3s. could be sold tor
3s. lOd. after five years’ storage and at
4s. lOd. even after 10 #
“Billy Blue”: Sydney’s first abattoirs were
at Dawes Point, and were under the direc-
tion of one Cribb, after whom, no doubt,
Cribb-laue in that locality obtained its name.
The primitive slaughter-house remained
there, overlooking Sydney Cove, till the
mid ’2o’s. In the Sydney Gazette of Octo-
ber 4. 1826, it was announced that Mr.
James Wilshire, of Brickfield Hill, bad
opened a new slaughter-house at the extre-
mity of Bathurst-street, and that all persons
taking cattle there to be slaughtered
should use Goulburn-street only. James
Wilshire had a tannery on the eastern side
of George-street, near where Wilmot-street
now runs through to George-street. His
son was the second Mayor of Sydney. As
the city grew it became necessary to hnd
a new site for the slaughter-house.
Glebe Island was selected, and it retained
its job till the present time.
“Vic”: After shooting parties have been
arranged the word goes forth that it is close
season all the year for duck and teal in this
State. However, ' nobody cavils, except to
say that earlier notice might well have been
given. The murder usually begins on
February 11 and ends on June 30. The
quail season is also cut down to three months
instead of four. From this out every third
year is to be absolutely closed for duck and
teal. Justifying this. Director Lewis, of the
Fisheries and Game Department., says : "The
measure is necessary because of the lack, of
water nowadays. The birds are on a few
large sheets, swamps and lakes having dried.
There is, in consequence, very little breed-
ing, and we must do something to. give them
—ducks in particular—a chance.”

HOW I GOT RID OF MY GREY HAIR
After Having 1 Been Completely Grey Since the Age of 28.
A Simple, Harmless Method, which can be used in One’s Own Home with Complete Success.
By MARY K. CHAPMAN.
lam a woman who belongs to a prematurely grey-haired family. My
father was grey before he was 30. and two of my brothers, as well
as inv sister, became grey early in life. Before the age of 25 I
developed grey hairs, which became quite embarrassing to
me—socially and also in business. I lost three good
positions for no other reason than my fading hair.
The greyness increased with alarming rapidity, and at
28 I looked like a woman of 45. One day I was
seriously thinking of buying one of the numerous
Grey Hair "Restorers that are extensively advertised
when I casually mentioned the subject to an
acquaintance—a scientific man, and, as I learnt
afterwards, a great student of the Chemistry of the
Hair. He strongly advised me to have nothing to do
with these concoctions; he said they were nothing more
than simple “dyes” or “stains.” He pointed out that
such preparations eventually ruined the hair, and in the
meantime deceived nobody, not even tbe casual observer.
He suggested that I try a formula that he had
perfected after a considerable time, that by a certain
chemical action on the pigmentary coloring cells restored the
hair to its natural color. In reply to my inquiries, he assured
m
m
m
My appearance to-
day is a delight to
myself and a sur-
prise to my friends.
me that the formula was not only absolutely harmless, but would develop
a Strong and Beautiful Giowth of Hair. My friend wrote out
this prescription, which I had made up, and after following
the instructions for a few days I was surprised and
delighted to find my hair becoming richer and darker in
tone. The re-coloring process continued until after some
few weeks my hair actually once again possessed the
natural shade of my girlish days. Since then I have
been inundated with inquiries from friends and also
from persons unknown to me, who came to.hear of
this wonderful preparation. Having become con-
vinced that I have found a remedy of extraordinary
merit, and which is quite harmless, I have resolved to
offer it for sale, as I am certain from my own experience
that it will prove an inestimable boon to any man or woman
who finds Grey Hair to be the same serious handicap it was
to me. If you are interested in this wonderful prepara-
tion. I am willing to send you complete instructions,
FREE, under plain sealed cover.

Madam
Having completed my analytical examin-
ation of your "Genuine Specific" for grey hair I
enclose results.
My analysis proves that it is in every way
suitable for the purpose for which it is advertised,
viz:- the restoring of grey hair to its natural
colour or the darkening of grey hair. There is no
danger of it staining the skin and it will not wash
off. It is in no way injurious to the hair.
It will remove any hardness or dryness, and
will .render the hair soft to the touch..
Yours faithfully,
Public Analyst registered under the Pure Food Act 190 S

How She Stopped Her
Husband’s Drinking.
By all Means Write to Her
and Learn How She Did It.
For over 20 years James Anderson, of
963 Elm Ave., Hillburn, N.Y., U.S.A., was a
very hard drinker. His case seemed a hope-
V. !
less one, but 10 _ years
ago his wife, in their own
little home, gave him
a simple remedy which,
much to her delight,
stopped his drinking
entirely.
To make sure that
the remedy was respon-
sible for this happy re-
sult she also tried it on
her brother and several
of her neighbors. It
was successful in*every
case. None of them has
touched a drop of in-
toxicating liquor since.
She now wishes everyone who has drunk-
enness in their homes to try this simple
remedy, for she feels sure that it will do as
much for others as it has for her. It can be
given secretly if desired, and without cost
she will gladly and willingly tell you what it
is. All you have to do is write her a letter-
asking her how she cured her husband of
drinking, and she will reply by return mail
in a sealed envelope. As she has nothing to
sell do not send her money. Simply send a
letter with all confidence to Mrs. Margaret
Anderson at the address given above, taking-
care to write your name and full address
plainly. (We earnestly advise every one of
our readers icho wishes to cure a dear one
of drunkenness to write to this lady to-day.
Her offer is a sincere one.)*

BILIOUS HEADACHES.
DR. MORSE’S INDIAN ROOT PILLS AN
UNEQUALLED REMEDY.
“My sister first recommended Dr. Morse’s
Indian Root Pills to my notice when subject
to distressing bilious headaches,” writes Mrs.
Annie Gill, !)8 Victoria Street, Lewisham.
“I tried many assumed remedies for this
complaint, but found nothing to equal Dr.
Morse’s Indian Root Pills. Latterly I have
been freed from my former bilious bouts,
but nevertheless I consider it expedient to
keep them in my house in case of need. I
am a mother of two children, and offer you
my permission to use this testimony for
publication.”
Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills relieve
biliousness speedily. They open the
clogged-up system, purify the blood and
cleanse the stomach, causing the human
mechanism to work smoothly and easily. By
taking a course of these pills on the first
appearance of bilious symptoms, this dis-
tressing complaint will be avoided.*

MAKE YOUR OWN HAIR
STAIN.
This Home-made Mixture Darkens Grey
Hair and Makes It Soft and Glossy.
To a half-pint of water add: —
Bay Rum loz.
Orlex Compound A small box.
Glycerine Joz.
These are all simple ingredients that you
can buy from any chemist at very little cost,
and mix them yourself. Apply to the scalp
once a day for two weeks, then once every
other week until all the mixture is used. A
half-pint should be enough to rid the head
of dandruff and kill the dandruff germs. It
stops the hair from falling out, relieves
itching and scalp troubles.
Although it is not a dye it acts upon the
hair roots, and will darken streaked, faded
grey hair in 10 or 15 days. It promotes the
growth of the hair and makes harsh hair
soft and glossy.* [8

POINTS
ANDY FISHER TAKES THE GEORGE
REID TRACK AND RECKONS THAT
LOANS ARE A GREAT IDEA.
How N.S.W. does get along with the job
of eliminating the middleman and the pri-
vate capitalist ! It is now proposed that
an English firm of private capitalists shall
construct the State’s new railways by con-
tract labor, and shall also act as middlemen j
in raising the necessary funds from private j
bloated millionaires abroad. Truly, borrow-;
ing makes us acquainted with strange bed-
fellows.
What a futile joke is all this frothy talk
about capturing German trade when you
consider the bald facts of Australia’s wool
and woollen trade: —
Value of year’s production.. .. £26,000,000
Value of wool used locally.. .. 362,000
Value of woollen imports . . .. 7,000,000
Of that £7,000,000 worth of imports Aus-
tralia sent away about one-fourth as raw
wool, and then dragged it back again. The
other three-fourths went to pay wages for
foreign workmen, many of whom are now
shooting at us; and profits for foreign em-
ployers, many of whom are now paying for
the bombs. While the Australian worker
has his arbitration courts to see that he gets
decent wages and that his employer doesn’t
make bloated profits, the foreign employer
can make what profit he pleases and pay
his workers as little as he likes. In such
circumstances why should a manufacturer
shift his operations from Europe to Aus-
tralia?
Anniversary Day (January 26) has for
years seen the opening of the annual I’.L.L.
conference in N. S. Wales; but the war has
caused a postponement. This year the
coiToboree will not begin till April 3. Then
550 branches will have right of representa-
tion. It will be a stormy conference, increas-
ing to a cyclone when somebody drags out
the plank for the abolition of the Upper
House, and the non-borrowing plank, and
hurls them into the proceedings. There are
a score of other things over which there will
be unpleasantness; but Holman, the party
leader, who has developed a tendency to
avoid Labor conferences, will probably be in
London. London covers a multitude of sins.
If he isn’t in London he will say it is true
they have borrowed enormously and haven’t
abolished the Council; but see what a good
time “the chaps” have had ! And a good
time for the chaps also covers a multitude of
sins.
Cable, dated January 20: —
The Chief Justice, in the Court of Appeal, has
decided that an alien enemy may he sued in the
British court, but cannot himself sue. The alien
has the right of appeal.
The point was brought before a full Court
of Appeal specially constituted to declare
the law. It consisted of the Lord Chief
Justice, the Master of the Rolls, Buckley.
Swinfen Eady, Phillimore, Bickford and
Kennedy—probably the strongest bench that
has ever assembled ; and it has taken nearly
two months to give its decision. Simon, the
Attorney-General, argued the law. In addi-
tion to the above proposition he defined an
alien enemy as anyone, including Britishers,
resident in enemy territory. A German
resident in British territory is not an alien
enemy. Companies are “legal entities.” A
co. of British registry is consequently not
an enemy, even though controlled by Ger-
mans. though under a new law all profits of
such cos. have to be paid to an official trustee
to be kept by him fill the war is over.
The Holman Government
has moved the Taxation De-
partment to extra strenuous
efforts. The Investigation
Bureau, where the financial
possibilities of every citizen
are tabulated, has beeji work-
ing double shifts, and a
warm time awaits the per-
son who intends to hide his
affluence under a bushel of
silence. One man who said
nothing about a profit of
£3500 from the transfer of an
hotel license was amazed
when the Department spoke
to him about it and de-
manded the full dues. Book-
-111 ake r s wli o cheerfully
ignored the Taxation De-
partment in the cheeky
assumption that because bet-
ting is an illegal business its
profits are not liable to taxa-
tion have been made to real-
ise that the Government is
too stony to stand on cere-
mony and that it must have
all back money as well as
current dues. Altogether
the Taxation people are the
greatest hustlers in the pub-
lic service these days. With
State finances on the rocks,
and the pawnshops closed,
and an avalanche of interest
falling due, and Bill and Jim
to be paid boom wages
though the boom has past,
every possible penny is
needed, and the Taxation De-
partment is the rake with
which Holman is going to
clean up the congregation.
The high price of meat is not a new
trouble. Exactly 1611 years ago the Neces-
sary Commodities Commission —whose name
was Diocletian —fixed the price of ham in
England at lOd. per lb. and sausage at 4d.
Sausage is very, very old. and often it tastes
like it. At tbe same time sea-fish was Is.
2d. per lb. and a bath cost 2d.
It is officially announced that during the
last half of 1014 —the time of war and
drought-—the net revenue from N.S.W. rail-
ways and tramways increased by nearly
£ll.OOO. It wasn’t much of an increase, but
unless it was hopelessly swamped by interest
on new loans it was at least something.
These figures confirm the impression that
the poor, downtrodden war has been made
an excuse fur a vast reduction of services
on lines which, by reason of the congestion
policy, have been run at a loss ever since
they came into existence.
NEW SOUTH WALES NIGHTMARE
From the office meteorologist:—
If Griffith resigns bis seat in the 'N.S.W. Ministry
don’t be extraordinarily surprised. He is no longer
popular in the Caucus. In fact, he never was. I-Ie
is arrogant in a coterie where “geniality” is most
highly valued. Besides, even in his own party, be
never entirely recovered from the uncomfortable feeling
caused by the attacks which preceded the last general
election. Now there is available a bureaucratic
billet where geniality doesn’t matter ; wherefore kites
are being sent up to find out how the public would
take the Minister for Works as the new Commis-
sioner for Irrigation, rice L. A. B. Wade, deceased.
THE YAP.
MELBOURNE, WEDNESDAY . —Mr. Cook, leader of the
Federal Opposition, made a further statement to-day
regarding Australia’s part in the supply of fighting
material for the front. ‘‘My position has been made
very clear already, both in Parliament and outside,”
said Mr. Cook.
Joseph's “position” isn’t worth mentioning ,
anshow.
The death rate per 1000 persons between
the ages of one year and 21 years was lower
in the Northern Territory in 1012 than in
any other part of the Commonwealth. Here
are the figures: Ma State, 3.01; Victoria,
3.55; Bananaland, 3.52; South Aus., 2.60 ;
Westralia, 3.81; Flyspeck, 3.42 ; 'Northern
Territory, 1.62. For people at the other end
of the road the Territory also has the lowest
death-rate. For persons of 00 and upwards :
N.S.W., 59.43 per 1000; Victoria, 68.72:
Bananaland, 57.04; South Aus.. 50.01 ; West- ,
ralia, 50.57; Tasmania, 62.69; Northern
Territory, 1/9.18. It is held by Bruce Smith
and the colored-labor crowd that to send a
white woman to live in the Territory is an .
atrocity beside which the Gerhog outrages
are mere playfulness ; yet the female death-
rate in the most slandered part of the
Commonwealth was, 1012, only 10.15, as
compared with 11.07 for Victoria, where
even a paragon of chivalry like B. Smith
would have no scruples about asking a lady .
to live. Also, of 17 deaths from malaria — j
essentially a tropical disease—in the Com- S
monwealth in 1012 not one occurred in the
Northern Territory; and its cancer death-
rate is the lowest in Australia. On the
other hand, in this deadly region, where,
according to the Small Australian, it is
absurd to expect a white man to survive
when he has lost the vitality of youth, six
people died from senile debility, and one of
them was a woman !
A plaint against the P.M.G. has been filed
on behalf of a “general agent” by lawyer
Joe Woolf, of Melbourne, who contends
that the difference between State and inter-
state post and telegraph rates is a violation
of the Federal Constitution. The discovery
that regulations and things are ultra vires
is a speciality with Woolf, and his plaint
seems bound to get the Interstate Commis-
sion thinking, lie wants to know whether
the Constitution permits Spence to charge
ss. Bd. for carrying a parcel between (say)
Broken Hill and Adelaide, while for carrying
the same parcel through Adelaide and Mel-
bourne on to Sydney and Newcastle the
tariff is only 3s. 6d. He is objecting to the
system which allows an Albury citizen to
send for Od. a telegram to Sydney, which
costs Is. if it is wired to the nearest office
across the Murray. The P.M.G. denies the
allegation and disputes the Inter-State Com-
missions’s right to deal with such matters,
anyhow.
Holman has more than war and drought
and Bill’s dirt money to worry him. He
is sick and tired of his precarious job—
anyway, he is sick and tired of the precari-
ousness of his job—and the Agent-General-
ship would suit him splendidly. But, un-
fortunately. McGbwon only retired in Hol-
man’s favor on the latter’s promise that he
would light at least two elections as the
leader of the Labor party. Unless McGowen
will release' him, this promise would be
broken if Ilolman accepted the position of
Agent-General before the next general elec-
tion. Yet the longer Holman delays taking
this position, the greater the risk of his not
getting it at all. Thus is he sorely tempted.
THE TERROR.
Since everyone receiving £200 a year from any
source must submit a statement of his affairs to the
Government’s inquisitorial gaze, many people who
used to wag' their heads at the income-tax collector
now view him with uneasiness, if not alarm, while
some of those with incomes even below that limit,
seeing him getting so much nearer themselves, do
not know where he is going to stop.

ADDITIONAL EXTRACTS FROM THE LOG OF
THE GOOD SHIP DOU.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
The other day, or night, we almost stranded.
But managed just to claw lier off in time;
Now, here we are, a-leaking and short-handed,
And, rolling as if Davy Jones commanded
A crew of cut-throats working out their crime.
Across a windless sea we’re slowly drifting;
Some surface-current bears us on its stream;
Of all our rags there’s not a bunt-line lifting.
And, in the hold, our paper cargo’s shifting
Like some hag-ridden sleeper in his dream.
Right overhead, the whitc-liot sun, unwinking,
Glares from the brassy sky upon our deck.
The planks are worn, and weather-grained, and
shrinking ;
And in the harness-cask the salt-junk’s stinking--
The lOU’s a most unpleasant wreck.
We’re not becalmed, so much as we’re dumly
founded —-
We shudder now to think of our close call.
Why, there we were, with confidence unbounded,
A-sailing bold and heaity, all sails rounded
To favoring winds, and bound for old Three Ball.
When, suddenly, that spanking breeze departed,
The emptied sails boomed loud against the mast;
All hands from slumber, feast or frolic started,
And even then we didn’t get down-hearted,
Although we found the glass was falling fast.
An ordinary sailor, at that warning,
Would promptly set all hands to shorten sail;
But Captain Vanderholman, danger scorning,
Cried; “Lads, we’ll carry on until the morning—
She’ll travel all the faster in the gale!”
The storm came up : away we dashed before it,
With every stitch of canvas we could set.
Our grand old barque full gallantly she bore it.
The gale increased. Our captain cried: “Ignore it!
Port Loan lies right ahead—we’ll fetch it yet!”
We might have made the port, or else run under;
But, as she foamed along and fairly flew,
A war-squall struck us, with a noise like thunder,
lip went our rockets! And we softly wonder
Where we’d be now but for the lifeboat crew.

SPORTING
NOTIONS
One of the most popular athletic events
in Australia is the annual “Swim through Perth, in
the Swan River. The first race was held on January
6, 1912, and since then the event has become of State
eminence and national notability. I his yeai at 3.1 n
p.m., the first of 32 competitors (including tour
young women) hurtled into the water and started on
the five-mile journey. At four o’clock the scratch
man was let go and the big tussle was in full swing.
It was an inspiring picture those young Australian
athletes swam through—the river crowded with boats,
the piers black with, sightseers, men shouting encour-
agement, women waving hankies- in excitement. Two
of the girl swimmers soon dropped out through a
misunderstanding about the course, and one gave up
from cramp, but the rest of the crowd plugged on,
for long lying as their handicaps had placed them.
Half a mile from home the leader, a youth, who was
swimming strongly and looked all over a winner,
suddenly shut-up with cramp. This left the only
girl now in the race at the front, and she made a
game fight to keep there. But there were more
powerful arms behind her, notably the scratch man,
who was ploughing through, with an unfortunately
crippled-in-the-legs though fine-looking gold-fielder
leading the way. All the strength of the gold-field
man was in his great, powerful arms, and they seemed
tireless. Flailing the water with long, over-head
strokes, he reached home first, the scratch man 200yds.
behind, second. Details of the finish: E. Friedlander
(Kalgoorlie), 22min. hep., 2hr. Bimin, one; W. Reed
(lvalgoorlie), scr., lhr. 47min., two; R. Davies
(Guildford), 25min., 2hr. 13min., three; Miss Ena
Ewart (Perth Ladies'), 29min., 2hr. ISmin., four.
The winner takes a ten-guinea cup.

Brisbane was disappointed last week on
the second occasion Duke Kahanamoku was billed to
swim under the auspices of the Amateur Assoc.
Neither he nor Cunha started in the relay race, and
the Big Fish was absent from the board when the
50yds. Invitation Handicap was set going. The ex-
planation given is that he was unwell. However, in
the 110yds. Invitation Handicap the Hawaiian gave
the crowd a thrill for its money. Springfield, of the
Valley Club, had a 12sec. start, and the race was
a desperate effort on his part to keep ahead and a
mighty paddle by Kalianamoku to overtake him.
Sheer pluck and grit kept Springfield from falling
back ; every ounce of water-punch he had was used,
and, amidst rallying cheers, lie struck the board a
few feet to the good. The bronze man’s time was
lmin. 3 l-ssee.
On Saturday night Kahanetc. showed again what a
torpedo he is over the 100yds. It was a handicau
race at South Brisbane, and be won it from scratch
by a touch. Loewe, who had 9sec. start, was second.
Winner’s time, 54 4-ssec., is a record for Bananaland.
* * * *
Kahanamoku expects to make another tour
of Australia next year—anyhow, that’s what he whis-
pered to the Warwick people in announcing his
inability to accept their invitation to go along last
week and show them how to swim.
There’s more than biscuit and cheese to be
got out of running a swimming carnival, especially
from the amateur side. The recent N.S.W. cham-
pionship meeting at Sydney yielded a gate of £lOOO.
Of this the A.S.A. took £750 for exes., which
left £250. On the strength of this the Vic. A.S.A.
is putting ginger into the arrangements for the visit
of Kahanamoku. Melbourne Club has charge of the
boom.
Saturday’s play in N.S.W. v. Victoria
Sheffield Shield match may be advanced as another
excuse for the downward drift of cricket in public
estimation. Batsmen, bowlers and fieldsmen alike
were listless, and the innumerous spectators, stretched
on the grass or seats, seem to have caught the
complaint. In 4hrs. 46min. on Saturday 15 bats-
men and old Sundries accumulated only 250 runs. The
fault with cricket is that it has degenerated into a
matter of defence instead of offence. Many years
ago, complaining of the same thing. The Bulletin
tipped, as the coming champions of the world, the
Chinamen, “who have imperturbability and patience,
aval are capable of dying at the wicket of old age.”
L. A. Cody, who defied N.S.W. bowlers for
115 min. and also scored 27 runs, formerly played Syd-
ney grade cricket with Paddington. This season he
dropped into the secretaryship of Fitzrov (Vie.) club,
and got a meteoric rise into the Vic. XI. He has a
rock-like defence.
Arthur Mailey, who captured six wickets for
62 in Vic.’s first innings, though small of stature,
propels the “Bosie” ball and well conceals the break
• —the stumbling-block of most of those who have
copied this style of bowling. In the early part of
Vic.’s innings Mailey’s bowling was patchy, but after
“tea” the tail of the team was literally chopped off,
and he finished with the spanking average of 10.33
per wicket. Left-hander J. R. Flynn also bowled
well, sending down 25 overs (of which 14 were
maidens) for one wicket and 38 runs. Both he and
Mailey fell into the N.S.AV. team through other
players being unavailable; and they both filled their
measure of opportunity to the brim.
* * * *
There was one touch of levity in the
N.S.W.-Vic. cricket match —the efforts of Warwick
Armstrong to keep his trousers on. Every few seconds
they were hitched up vigorously, until it appeared
probable that they wouldn’t stand the strain. The
match celebrated Armstrong’s 50th Sheffield Shield
match, and the 16st. athlete celebrated his 56min. at
the wickets by pottering about for 27 runs.
Adelaide cricket lias suddenly become
interesting. East Torrens and Adelaide, which all
last season and for half of this stood out from the
rest, have been beaten, once by Port Adelaide and
the other by Sturt ; and Glenelg has knocked out
University. The first-named two are still first and
second on the list, but the margin is narrow enough
to make the future promising.
English cricketers are being passed the
jam for the manner in which they are hammering at
the door of the recruiting sergeant. Hundreds have
joined the colors ; many will never see another score-
board, except that which records, in Heaven tine deeds
on earth; and the wounded are straining at their
bandages to get back to the battle pitch and slam in
a few fast ones to the Grunters. Amongst the big
team are (or were, when the last mail left) 13 men
who have played in Test matches. Three of them—
“ Plum” Warner, J. W. H. T. Douglas and 11. D. G.
Leveson-Gowcr —have captained English teams.
Rugby footballers have also rallied strongly, and it
is announced from the. headquarters of the English
Union that over 90 per cent, of playing members
are in khaki. Every international player who has
represented England during the past few years has
gone a-hunting. Practically the same thing applies to
Rugby Unions throughout the Empire.
The Australian Junior Cricket Board of
Control is considering a suggestion for the enliven-
ing of the game, that there should be eight balls to
the over. It ought to help; and help is urgently
required for the survival of the hittist.

The Griffiths Cup, which is the outward
and visible sign of the motor-boat champion-
ship of Australia, will remain in Melbourne for
another 12 months, Nautilus 11. (Vic.), the holder,
having shown her stern-post to Millewa (S.A.),
Kangaroo (N.S.W.), and two other Victorian boats
named Vanish and Katie 8., on Saturday, in Hob-
son’s Bay. The distance was, roughly, 19 miles.
Nautilus 11. won the first two heats straight out.
She made the first distance in 32inin. 45sec., and
the second in 33min. 20sec. Millewa, the second
boat, slipped over the track in 38min. lOsec. and
44min. 30sec. The N. S. Wales candidate, Kan-
garoo, did not finish. In fact, she hardly started,
breaking down early in the first trial.
ARMSTRONG, captain of the Victorian
cricket team.
The difficulty of getting a champion sculler
into a boat without a lot of fuss and will-and-shan’t
is a weariness to the flesh. William Webb, of
Maoriland, is a case in point. The latest news con-
cerning Paddy Hannon’s challenge to him to race
for the championship of the Pawned Islands is that
he will give a definite answer this week. Maoriland
enthusiasts are hoping the match will come off to
liven up a sport which is dead there. One of the -
quickest ways to liven it is to impress upon cham-
pion oarsmen the necessity of either g'etting into
the shells when the call comes or quitting the game.
A few months ago, when Ben Thorough-
good was rowed out by Arthur Pearce, at Sydney,
for the heavy-boat championship, 16ft. craft were
used. On Saturday, at Middle Harbor, the pair met
again to race for the championship and a side-wager
of £25. This time 18ft.. wherries were the vehicles,
and it was made clear that in such craft the elderly
Thoroughgood (he is 47) is the master mariner. The
distance was about a mile and three-quarters, and the
winner’s time 16min. 21sec. The official decision was
a win by six lengths. As a matter of fact, it was no
race at all. Pearce merely took a boat which didn’t
suit him, and joined the procession.

W. B. Jones, who recently died in Queens-
land, was Tasmania’s most noted sculler, as far as
home performances go. He scored his first win in
the Maiden Sculls in 1868 on the Derwent, and the
next year annexed the Alexandra Sculls and the
championship, repeating the feat in the two follow-
ing years. In 1872 he rowed in the Intercolonial
Champion Gig race, the first inter-State race in
which Tasmania took part. Though not a pretty
oarsman he got great pace out of the boat, and was
a fine stayer with a good deal of reserve lower.
His banking job took him from Hobart to Queens-
land, where he died.
A crowd of about 15,000 turned up at
Sydney Stadium on Saturday, to see a contest between
fistic Masters, and ail they were offered was a
game played by the men’s seconds. Darcy had
influenza, and Jeff Smith looked as though he had
been at a wedding. Before the conflict' began the
crowd was treated to the good old Yankee sport of
“rattling the adversary,’’ first popularised here by
Tommy Burns. That is to say, Jeff turned up
late, and having languidly climbed into the ring,
proceeded to delay matters by means of all the
regulation devices. The idea was that Darcy, being
a novice more or less, would become perturbed.
They clashed ultimately, and the Maitland youth
won the first round by miles. lie also won the
second and third. The fourth was about even,
with the balance, if anything, slightly in Jeff’s favor.
Halfway through the fifth Darcy was hit low by
a pile-driving right. Tie doubled up and limped to
the ropes. Jeff provided the best possible evidence
of the fact that he knew he had made a bad mis-
take by standing off and giving his writhing adver-
sary a chance to recover, although A 1 Lippe and
the rest of his corner were howling to him to
wade in and finish the enemy —who, of course, would
have deserved the worst had he been shamming.
The referee failed to see the foul. He had no
option, accordingly, but to order Darcy to fight on.
Darcy, after consultation with his corner, actually did
resume, and for the few seconds that remained lie
battled with some vigor. Immediately the gong
went Darcy showed the house and the referee his
metal shield, which had a dent in it the size of a
small saucer, and Dave Smith threw his towel in.
Uproar naturally followed. The most blatant performer
was Lippe, who, absurdly costumed in a with
Old Glory on the stomach of it, galloped frdfu' place
to place, giving an imitation of one Grossly
Wronged. In the interests of pfeage this particular
bottle-holder ought to be suppressed the next’ time
Jeff Smith engages anybody. ■ •-7
As to the misconduct of the other chief second—
Dave Smith —there can be no question. When he
threw the towel in, Darcy—who, if he had been
seriously injured by the blow which. «yused the
trouble, would have been and
strong. It may have been an
the referee’s '
Dave, who is no fool, reasoned tlnjOway, -.yms nl*|n
had influenza. He had given a mafeferljf exhibition
up to the time of the foul, but would be likely to
tire later on. The blow, though it hadn’t stopped
Darcy, would do him no good. Even the loser’s
end of such a house .was worth collecting; while, in
view of Darcy’s , improved forip, a wast -cro#@ yyas a
certainty the next tirfffe heAnd' J&ff met. * The|
production of the towel was ( ertairtly sound tactics
—from Darcy’s standpoint. ...On flit'other'handr; it
was rotten luck for Snowy -Baker and the’ crowd.
The Big Fight was really a side line; the contest
proper was one of wits, from which Dave Smith
emerged an easy winner.
Alf Morey beat Fred Kay at Brisbane
Stadium on Saturday. Kay fought, as usual, on the
defensive, and Morey led from start to finish, which
doubtless influenced the decision. If Kay would
only lead at the other man some more, and cense to
be content to make the enemy miss, he would be a
genuine champion. *

Joe Carter, who has just celebrated his
82nd birthday, won the first V I .R.C. Derby (in the
’so’s) on Flving Doe, and was successful in Aus-
tralian Cups of 186(5 and 1867, V.R.C. St. Legers of
i 869 and 1870, and hundreds of other races in the
early days. He passes the time nowadays as gate-
keeper to three Victorian racecourses—Flemington,
Caulfield and Moonee Valley.

The 50 to 1 shot, Ninfia, who won the
A.J.C. Challenge Stakes by a neck from Barley
Water, is a six-year-old mare by the imported Haut
Brion from Jersey Lily, and is raced by trainer
W Barry. Her three previous nerformances were:
Fifth in the A.J.C. Hiehweiaht Handicap, in Decem-
ber ; fourth in the Warwick Farm January Pace
Welter; nowhere in the Moorefield January Flying
Handicap. On Saturday, Brattle, who had topped
the market during the week, started a hot favorite
at threes in a field of 21, Portrush and Isbal, next on
the list, being away down at eights. The “prophets”
would have nothing but Brattle. None of them once
mentioned Ninfia or Barley Water. The favorite was
ridden by W. Lillvman, who had steered three
winners at Moorefield the previous Saturday, two at
Kernbla Grange and two at a pony meeting during
the week. Yet Brattle could do no more than finish
two lengths behind Barley Water, where she and
Arrowform, another false alarm, dead-heated for
third prize. The undeniably good chance of J.
Lloyd’s well-proved old warrior was so completely
forgotten among the loud Brattling of the journal-
istic guides that he started at 33 to one and paid
eight to one for a place. All the Ikey Noses have
place books now. They seem to think that laying
a fourth of the winning odds against one, two, three
is a satisfying substitute for the tote! Bless them!
But, pending the tote, every punter should back his
fancy to win, and be placed.

Reputation, Maoriland’s champion three-
vear-old, has lowered all records for that horse-age
by winning £4BOO for the season —a trifle of £BOO
better than any previous figures on the book. Good
judges consider Reputation to be the best three-year-
old Maori land has seen in modern times ; and, as the
animal is booked for the A.J.C. meeting at Sydney
at Easter, he will have an opportunity to prove it.
Warstep, which won Auckland (M.L.)
Cup, was the third mare to win the event. It is
20 years since a lady horse arrived home in anticipa-
tion of the field in that race.
The English flat-racing season forgot
(doubtless on account of the war) to cable to Aus-
tralia its statistics when it closed at the end of
November. Wootton was easily the most successful
trainer for winning horses (29) or races won (40),
but was not in the big things this time, and for cash
won was a bad third with £17,000. Alec Taylor
was top with £51,000. No one owner won anywhere
near that. The big races mostly went to more-or-less
visiting “commoners.” Dukes of Portland and West-
minster were nowhere. Joel is all alone at the top
with £30,000, Astor second with £16,000. There
were only seven owners with five-figure wins, and
King George, with £ll,OOO, was one of them. Aus-
tralia was for once badly represented in the jockeys’
list, which was a runaway for Donohue with 129
wins—very nearly double the next best. Our Bullock,
Huxley and Pi out won from 40 to 50 apiece. As for
winning sires, Polymelus made a jump to the head of
the list; William the Third, Sundridge and Spear-
mint following.

S.A. Amateur Athletic Association—a
“willing”.body which does less work than it would
wish, owing to lack of any strong local public
demand has just leceived a valuable recruit in the
Naval and Military Sports Union of the State. The
joining-up will be useful to our boys abroad, too.
About the first question asked. any of thtm taking-
part in a race anywhere under British rule will be,
“Are you an amateur?” and the next, “Are you solid
with your local association?” The amateur athlete
is a great unionist.
Sydney amateur champion cyclist E. W.
Pedersen, who lias hung the bike on the peg owing to
ill-health, was a wheeler of tonnage in his palmy
days. Among his victories are two amateur record's
-(ioulburn-to-Sy<lney race (133 miles) from scratch
in 6hr. 24min. 30sec., and Western-road (via Parra-
matta) nine-mile course in 21min. 49sec.; also, a
formidable list of “fastest times” and scratch races
(the more recent being a win with Burtinshaw in
the six-hours’ teams race last November). Pedersen
is the best cycle-pusher the N. S. Wales amateur
ranks lias sheltered for years.

N. S. Wales howlers have adopted from
Victoria an improved system of deciding the single-
handed championship. Hitherto, in the older State,
it"has been tire custom to work off the games during
ordinary week-days (Mondays to Fridays)—a long,
round-about, dreary method. In Victoria, Saturdays
are the deciding days, various greens are set aside,
and the fight is concentrated, as it were, in time and
space. That, of course, adds to the interest of the
competition. In Sydney it ’ was tried for the first
time last Saturday and worked well on nine greens.
The system could. >vith advantage,*,be applied to rink
and pairs championships.

Persistent efforts are being made to get a
start with the new football which it is proposed to
frame up from the Australian and Rugby League
games. The two bodies seem to have arrived at a
tentative scheme, and to • the hang of it it requires
jtqrtbe set out in detail. In regard to the Australian
-ig|isK ! tJiese are the alterations:—
cross-bar between the goal posts, 10 feet
frljpf the ground. The ball to be kicked over the
bar' to constitute a goal—ball' going under the
bar to coffiil as a. behind ; yrjthe behind posts to be
retained, and .beliindS scored-as at present.
(2) Throwing-or knocking, the ball backwards to
bo illegal. That is, the player in possession of the
ball, who knocks or throws thg. ball, must always be
b’e¥wStt^SStMSl>all, and the goal towards which he is
kicking. ’ V ' ~
(3) When .;!' piaveV in possession of the ball is
collared he may be thrown or jjufheib aside, even
Though he drops the ball immediateljj. he is caught.
The tackle in such instances will permit a player to
catch an opponent between the hips and the shoul-
der, Unless a deliberate foul occurs, no penalty
shall be* allowed for such tackle.
The League’s contributions towards the amalgama-
tion are
(X) Abolish the scrum.
(2) Adont the Australian rules method of throw-
ing the ball in from out of hounds.
(3) Bounce the ball in cases of scrimmage, as in
the Australian nth s.
(4) The player who obtains the try must also be
the kicker for goal as a- result of the try.
The prospects are doubtful. They'll be even more
doubtful unless some attractive exhibition games are
put up to start With.
On a recent (Saturday there were 04.000
fewer spectators at the big London football fields
than •on the previous week. Compared with the
same day last year the slump amounted to 232,000.
Maoriland middle-distance runner A. W.
Dormer, who recently went over from the amateur
to professional tracks, has since been leaving a long
trail of competi'ors behind him. At the professional
championship meeting he almost cleaned up the pro-
gramme, while at meetings at Kaitangata and Auck-
land there was scarcely a crumb left in the purse for
opponents. At the last-named gathering he won the
half-mile -handicap from scratch in lmin. 57 3-ssee. —•
which is only a trifle over 3sec. worse than F. S.
Hewitt’s world’s professional record. Provided a
promoter thinks it worth while, a match between

—-over 600yds.. 880yds. and a mile, would be a big
draw. The difficulty is to find anyone with sufficient
lack of consideration for money to shoulder such a
programme on a fading pastime.

The fifth inter-club sports run by the
V.A.A.A. at Melbourne Grammar School Ground last
Saturday, threatened to be a fizzle. The officials
declined to allow several peds. to race because their
pants had been cut green. The rest of the runners
collogued and decided to support the short-tailored
bunch. As that meant no races the officials held a
pow-wow and decided to allow all the pants to pro-
ceed. The trouble with the A.A. is that it won't look
on such things from a common-sense point of view.
It really matters little how short running knicks are
cut provided they are nice and full about the hips and
thighs. The A.A. also, by the way, insists on boxers
wearing singlets, and ait one time it insisted on
sleeves also; yet on the same programme wrestlers
were permittee! to appear in what amounted to a loin
cloth and a smile.

Hurdle jockeys at Lonford (Tas.) struck
the other day and refused to risk a broken neck for
a loser’s riding fee of £2. That fee was recently
fixed by the Tasmanian Turf Club, and meant £1
reduction on ruling rates. Owners promptly restored
the £3 minimum.
N.SAV. Rugby League has been officially
informed that the proposed visit of an English team
to Australia in 1915 is off. This leaves the League
to make up its draw-cards with Maoriland and
Queensland combinations. The suggested new game,
to be evolved from League and Australian modes of
play, is also likely to be put up as an attraction, or
an experiment, or try-on-the-dog. The dog’s re-
marks will probably be the most attractive part of
the show.
Lithgow (N.S.W.) is feelinc good about a
batsman named G. Conran, and challenges any sport
to produce a better in the surrounding territory. In
the Hartley district competition in three recent
matches he made 204 not out, 127 not out, and
221 not out.


You’d Be an Easy Mark
for a Scientific Boxer
Because you’re inexperienced. You’d be flurried and excited, and
consequently, leave “openings,” which would enable your opponent
to deal out severe punishment to you.
Your scientific opponent would be constantly drawing you on.
He’d be calm and collected, and make every blow leave a mark.
You’d be unable to penetrate his defence, and would be ashamed
at your lack of knowledge, and at. the humiliation of your being
defeated —possibly by a smaller man.
Ask yourself the question:—
IS IT WISE TO REMAIN CRUDE, when I can make
you a scientific Boxer?

“Melb” : The Victorian Unemployed Com-
mission, led by Mauger and advisory to
Peacock, has just leaped with delight Over
an offer by the Salvation Army to board
and lodge all unemployed for 10s. a week
each, the money, of course, to be. supplied
by Government. With the Army’s cheap-
labor facilities and what not, and the kind
of tuck and shelter it would give, I am
convinced it would make a snug profit. But,
whether or no, we don’t want these side-
shows to religious bodies, sprats for
mackerel. Our politicians gush over Salva-
tion Armies and the like, saying in effect:
“We thank you for doing our duty.” This
is a miserable spirit. Old Age Pensions
show the way. Why are they not left to
religious bodies?
The first Judge of the Supreme Court of
Civil Judicature in N.S.W., Jeffrey Hart Bent,
who remained in the colony from July,
1814. till the beginning of 1817, never heard
a cause nor delivered a judgment. He was
hot-tempered and overbearing and always
finding grievances. On arriving he found he
bad to sit in court with two magis-
trates, Broughton and Riley. At the first
sittings the emancipated attorneys applied
as usual to be heard. Bent refused; but
the two magistrates, having some consider-
ation for the public, and knowing they had
Governor Macquarie’s support, agreed to
hear them. Bent at once adjourned the
Court and never called it together again,
and it was not till Judge Field arrived in
1817 that causes were tried.

Enid McGush” : The habit of giving the
job of registrar of births, deaths and
marriages to the local storekeeper is per-
nicious. It may be cheap, but it is nasty,
and promotes fraud and crime. If the
causes of infanticide could, be correctly traced
it would be found that the terror of the local
storekeeper-registrar, whose business is
always more or less public property, has
been a nightmare with the mother of the
illegitimate child through many weary weeks
In a like manner the post office in the
grocers shop tends to defeat the kindly
purpose of the Commonwealth maternitv
bonus. The fact that the bonus ’is often
paid over among the tea and soap, to the
accompaniment of the grocer’s would-be
humorous comment, makes it a horror to
the recipient. It is bad enough for the public
to have all its postcards read by the family
of the purveyor of haricot beans ; but in the
more delicate matters that the post office
handles it is unutterable shame that these
people should be allowed to exercise a local
tyranny.

helpings of him every evening, and thus
inspire himself with the bad manners which
were his. habit. This was at the Cheshire
Cheese, in Fleet-street, where the steak,
lark, kidney and oyster pudding is still
served all through the winter. To our
Allies, the French, he serves as game. They
nave a system of revolving mirrors worked
by a string from a distance. The chasseur,
hidden behind a tussock with his gun, oper-
ates this mirror and larks come from all
quarters of the sky and flutter over it. He
also is very much a game bird, as anyone
who has observed the antics of setters and
pointers, when in his vicinity will be aware;
and he is also the only bird whose numbers
increase with the spread of agricultural im-
provement. In fact, with the exception of
the quail, he is the only true game bird we
have in Australia. And in the same spirit
as that in which we have regarded our trees
as nests and so destroyed our forests, and
our. rivers as useless and so squandered
then- waters, we are now about to poison
him.
Manaia ’: Auckland’s first home sensa-
tion of the war was a court-martial for
treason. F. E. N. Gaudin, a popular Auck-
lander, holding a captain’s commission in the
volunteer reserve, a partner in the German
farm of G. Ivronfeld, and a member
ot the City Council, journeyed to
Samoa on business, and on his return was
arrested and sent back to Samoa for trial.
All kinds of rumors as to the nature of the
enme flew round, and the staggering sentence
of five years’ hard labor handed out by tl>e
Court Martial at Samoa seemed to
confirm the idea that the offence was rank.
The . crime consisted chiefly of the
carrying of correspondence for Dr.
Schultz and other German prisoners of war,
a packet of photographs (including one
of the wireless station at Apia) for the
Auckland Weekly News, and some manu-
scripts for the same paper. Also, Gaudin
had, in defiance of Proclamation, carried
moneys due to his firm out of Samoa,
and had in his possession wlieu arrested
about £l5O, part of which settled a
private debt with Ivronfeld. An agita-
tion is now in full swing to have
the sentence reduced. Half the public
says that it is ferocious; the other half
argues that people who take big risks in
war. time shouldn’t complain when their
punishment comes along.
The first representative of the law in
Australia was Captain David Collins, who
came with the first fleet, and held the. office
of Judge Advocate, though he had had no legal
training. His successors, Richard Dore and
Richard Atkins, were no better in that
respect, and it was not till Ellis Bent, who
was a barrister, accompanied Macquarie to
N. S. Wales that the Governor had a com-
petent legal adviser. Meanwhile, however, sev-
eral Gentlemen One had come out at the Gov-
ernment’s expense, and one of these, being
appointed clerk to the Judge Advocate, pro-
vided that officer with the legal know-
ledge he often sadly needed. Some of the
other attorneys who had come under a cloud
were allowed to practise before the Judge
Advocate, and one of them afterwards
assured the British Government he had
actually given legal advice to the Governor
and his Council assembled to oppose the
rebel party in Bligh’s time. When Bent
arrived he allowed only limited practice to
convict-lawyers. The result was that
the Government in 1814 appointed two soli-
citors to the Colony at £3OO per annum
each. One, Frederick Garling, was to be
the Crown Solicitor; the other, William
Henry Moore, was to have private practice.
The former was to rank as senior. Moore
arrived in 1814, but Garling, who shipped
in the transport Frances and Eliza, was
captured by an American privateer, and did
not arrive till late in 1815. Meantime a new
Judge of the Supreme Court, Jeffery Hart
Bent, a brother to the Judge Advocate, had
arrived with the New Charter of Justice.
Melbourne’s public hospitals are keeping
up their reputation for casualness. On a
recent Saturday a doctor who had charge of
a six-months-old patient, a ward of the State,
went away and did not return until the
following Wednesday. He was then asked
to give a death certificate for the infant,
who had died on the Sunday. The doctor
thought the child was buried, but discovered
on Thursday that it was still in the hos-
pital. It was stated by someone that some-
body or other had rung up the Neglected Chil-
dren’s Department, which was understood
to have invited an undertaker to call round,
after which the hospital people seem to
have lost interest in the matter. At the
coroner’s inquiry the doctor who made the
post-mortem said that when the body was
brought to him it had already started to
decompose. The Coroner remarked that
somebody should he called on for an expla-
nation, and left it at that.
. Hermann Homburg, Attorney-General of
S* Aus., has got Premier Peake part of the
way out of an awkward difficulty by re-
signing. Peake, with a general election on
hand, couldn’t afford to offend the strong
German element in S. Aus. by pushing
Homburg out. On the other hand, Ilom-
burg’s inclusion in the Ministry was being
made the most of by the party which reckons
that just at present this little bit of
the earth belongs to us. While Homburg
remained in the team Peake had to defend
him, and say that German parentage
shouldn’t count, and commit other outrages
on the popular prejudices of the moment.
Besides Homburg (who is the son of an
ex-Supreme Court Judge of S. Aus.) there
are two men of German parentage in the
Assembly, Pflaum and Duhst; but they, as
well as Homburg, can probably win on
their names and their Tory principles, and
therefore won’t need to embarrass Peake
by being seen in his company. They all
come from farming districts, of course!
“The Oldest Inhabitant”
Apropos “the Mysterious Rossi,*’ a former Commis-
sioner of Police in N. S, Wales (B. 31/12/’l4).
His first appearance in Australia Was in 1825. He
came straight from England with the appointment of
magistrate and superintendent of police. With him
arrived a Mr. D’Arrietta, and both were said to have
been sent out to escape the popular clamor over their
alleged complicity in the Royal persecution of (Jueeii
Caroline. Also Cailie at the same time a woman Who
subsequently married a Wealthy butcher With property
lit Hunter-street—the family still Owns it. Rossi,
whose share in the Royal scandal was never defined,
afterwards settled near GOuiburn. At Picton, adjoin-
inig Major Antill’s estate, D’Arrietta made his home.
There fire some good reminiscences in a
new book by Maude Valerie White, Eng-
land’s best-known song-writer. One is about
Christine Nils Son, who was a bit shaky in
her English. It was she who first sang
Sullivan’s popular “Let Me Dream Again.”
Oh, do not wake me.
Waking Would be pain.
She made it: —■
Oh, do not whack me, i
Whacking would be pain,
until the guffaws cured her. Another
foreigner who muddled his English was
Richter, the German conductor who, since
the war began, has returned all his English
honors and decorations, and canhot now find
language to express his contempt for the
country where he made a lot of money out
of Wagner. Replying to a ietter inviting
his wife to a social function, Richter wrote;
“My wife Is not very strong. She must
always lie in the afternoon. If she does
not lie she swindles.” “Schwindeln” Is the
word for feeling faint.
One Robert Vansittart made a deplorable
error in London last month. He wrote
from the St. James Club, and asked why
the actors were doing nothing for their
country in the present crisis. He was just
an earnest actorphobe talking heatedly
through his hat. The leaders of the pro-
fession fell on him with statistics. They
showed that over 400 of the younger actors
are with the colors. Some of them, like
Robert Loraine, the flying man, have already
done notable service. The older ones, and
the women, have at least done their share
to raise money for the different funds. As
Fred Terry asked acidly, who is Mr. Van-
sittart and what has he done?
A line from “Mary M.,” evidently after
a bout with a butcher’s bill
1 have been turning over an old cookery book
which sets forth in good hand-printed type the kind
of food on which Oui' great-grandfathers were nour-
ished. One thing gripped me hard. Our great-
grandmothers used to go out into the lanes and
fields to gather many of their dishes. The follow-
ing are the constituents of an old salad: cabbage
plants, sorrel, parsley, tarragon, nettle-tops, penny-
royal, mint, salt, oil and vinegar. Has anyone made
a salad out of things that grow in our bush? In
these hard times of high prices and occasional wages
the experiment may be worth while. A diet of
bark may not be inviting, but there Is a lot of small
green stuff that looks distinctly more promising than
old boots.
“Hamer”: Something about the opera-
tions of the Picture Film Combine was con-
fided to N.S.W. Attorney-General Hall by a
deputation of showmen who wanted him to
declare picture films a necessary commodity
in order to prevent the film firms passing on
the duty. A member of the deputation said
that a picture programme at one time cost
about £l2 10s. a week, but jumped with the
advent of the Combine to £2O; and now, if
the film owners passed on the tariff charges,
it would cost nearly £3O. Also it was pointed
out that, as the films were leased to many
persons, the wholesale firms would not only
reimburse themselves for the amount of duty,
but after the gross cost bad been earned
would have an enormous extra profit. Hall
advised the showmen to take their case to
the Necessary Commodities Commission, and
as pictures are certainly as much a neces-
sary commodity to many persons as beer,
the picture merchants may have to slack
up a little. It’s about time.
“Dead Letter Office”: As a P.O. official
who was stung by “Montere” (B. 14/1/T5)
for non-delivery of his mail, let me ask him
if he is sure his goods were addressed even
reasonably. He’d be surprised if be was
where I am and saw what the fool-section
of the public can do in the way of addresses.
I’ve seen a letter come through Sydney
G.P.O. addressed to “Mrs. So-and-So, oppo-
site the horse-trough, Sydney,” and another
to “Miss Dash, Barmaid, Sydney.” In both
those instances the letters were delivered.
Thousands of letters come in addressed to
(say) Mr. Smith, “Pitt-street, Sydney.” But
that is a wealth of information compared
with what the unaddressed envelope furnishes,
and there are thousands of them annually.
Also, there are more thousands of people
who persist in including Coogee, Enmore,
Rockdale and so on, in “Sydney.” So a letter
addressed Miss Brown, 23 Jolm-street, Syd-
ney, may be meant for John-street, New-
town. Likewise, it may be meant for any
one of a dozen other Johu-streets. Mostly
it is.

Great Danger of
Insed Bites.
DOCTOR’S ALARMING STATEMENTS.
Protect Yourself Against Ordinary
Dangers by using
NEV-A-BITE
“There is no question,” says a leading
specialist, “that insect bites may lead to great
danger to health, and have been known to end
fatally.”
This alarming
statement, which
has appeared in
t h e influential
newspapers of this
country, should
grouse the public
to the fact that
bites .from mos-
quitoes and other
insects are things
to worry about.
It is quite pos-
sible that if one's
blood is in a poor
state an insect
bite might set up
such serious in-
flammation as to
cause blood-poi-
sbning, and —as everyone well knows —blood-
poisoning may lead to even the amputation of
a limb.
One has only to glance at the illustration
given here of the mosquito to realise what
terrifying poison-injecting parts this insect
has. It is absolutely necessary, not only for
the woman who desires to keep her complexion
in its natural condition, but also for the pro-
tection against more serious dangers, to secure
some reliable preparation which will prevent
insects from biting.
The best form of treatment of mosquito bites
is prophylactic, or preventive. The application
of a little of the Nev-a-bite lotion to the
forehead, neck and the instep (when openwork
stockings are worn) reduces the probability of
mosquito-bites to a minimum.
Nev-a-bite is a perfectly harmless pre-
paration, and serves to whiten, soften and
beautify the skin.
Nev-a-bite can be obtained at 9(1. per
bottle. Postage 3d. extra from —

holes, and has clumsy irritating seams.
‘Jason garments are made of best Australasian wool, woven by expert British workers, and
finished with the inimitable soft silky "feel" exclusive to ‘Jason. And the British branded mark
guarantees the excellence r.nd quality.
“Any garment that shr-'nks will e replaced free of cost."
Support honest British labour and quality—and insist on
‘Jason when you visit your dealer —he'll see you right.

B. Colreavy: Don’t fancy “succulent herbs”
for the complaint you mention. The cure is too like
bathing the brow with eau-de-cologne as a cure for
snakebite A.E.8.: One phrase appealed to us —
that about the squatter’s daughter whose “plethoric
amenities won for her friends.” We also liked “the
myoptie eyes of the colonial.” But these are rare
gleams of unconscious humor in an article which is
mostly dullness and hackneyed French* quotations....
H.M.W.: Many thanks. May use if space can be
found A.R.McL.: It appears to be correct....
A.R.R.S.: Like Clancy of the Overflow, the man you
lent “Glorian” to has “gone to Queensland droving,
and we don’t know where he are.”.... Literary:
Hodder and Stoughton’s results are not out yet.
Watch the Red Page Sylvia B.: Maria doesn’t in-
interest us. For one thing, her name doesn’t chime.
....Satyr: There is no cash for you:...J.L. (V.) :
Eulogy of that politician is ill-timed. . . .Comet: You
swoop cheerfully into the basket. But you may miss
it some day W-.R.McA.: Your grenade doesn’t hit
anything M.P.O'L.: Extra-mild verse. This is not
your market... .Blossom: Not here. Try one of your
home papers... .Der Tag: If you don’t get off the
Inky Way you will be trampled on by one of the
real poets Artemus: Verses very pleasant and full
of noble sentiments, but they are just a little dull.
... .Bellerive: Some prison pathos:—
B.E.: No.... Meta A. H.: Too late; the guns
have started again. .. .Sam G.: Not enough curse
and fire.... A. B.: You may be a good fighter. You
are a bad poet... .Willie (Q.) : Don’t do it again.
. ...A.G. (S/A.): Sketch-poem sinking fast....
A.R.C.: Emden verse 1 just received. You can’t, be
accused of rushing in. . . .Ken D.: It is not necessary
to write “Excelsior” all over again.. . .0. V-R.: Very
creaky humor. .. .J.R. : In accordance with your own
suggestion, verses It and 15 will be left out. This
suits us very well. We had already decided to leave
out verses one to 13.. ..One of the ’Eads (Broad-
meadows, V.) : Interesting sort of poem, but we can’t
print it. You are too outspokep. . . .A.WA It is
one of those jokes that don’t Carry beyond the front
gate....Zox: McBagpipes has been dekilted. . . .
A.W.S.: You arrive foaming like a German with a
little tinselled verse arid a demand that we be
“serious for once”—about the little tinselled verse.
Quite impossible. . . .Will G. (B.H.) : And what do
we care?. .. .John I. T.: Bright enough for private
circulation—dull for print.... Norman C. H.: Do
you think you could live on home-made hope for
about five years ?... . W-G.B.: Respectable try. You
started with an idea, and you didn’t maul it badly.
H.C.U.: Nothing in it T.M.T.: (1) Homer
Lea died Nov. 1, 1912, in California. Wrote “The
Valor of Ignorance,” “The Crimson Spider,” and
“Day of the Saxon” ; also projected a history of the
political development of China, which was not pub-
lished. (2) A man of military age may leave Ger-
many when he has done his service. He gets a
notice to come back on the outbreak of war, but
many disregard it.
TO AUTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
Alec: Three coarse monsters —a ruffian who looks
like a gorilla and carries a bottle; an injured per-
son who looks like a faded whale; and an
orang-outang in policeman’s uniform... .Clar-
ence: We have seen better ideas and better
pictures, but none that were worse. ...B. H.
Jones: Now, why did the scratchy person
in the thing that looks like a hen-coop tell the man
of enormous back-view that the child who was
standing on the Gladstone bag marked “H.J.K.”
had to sign the ticket? Is it a railway or steam-
boat or soup or pawn ticket? Where is the joke
located? Where is the joke? Where is anything?
....Mae Booloo: Very crude. Write to Adelaide or
Melbourne for a book on drawing. .. .Bert R.: Im-
mature. -No force. . . .C.II.I). : Stop scratching!. . . .
Rupert E.: You’re a bit previous, and your drawing
is still splendidly wooden... .W.J.: Bet you haven’t
seen any people like that lately!.... R.O. (V.):
Rock carving rejected. .. .Frank S.: The general effect
is dirty. . . .Evelyn C.: The 3d. will take them home
again. We have forgiven, but we can't forget. . . .
J.H.: You represent Australia as a sort of juvenile
lunatic.... R.D. : “Hoping to hear from you soon.”
Very well; we are posting you a gramophone record
of the 'staff's united yell of ribaldry.
Apropos “Black Maria.” recently super-
seded in Melbourne by a motor-van. The
first carriage of the sort in Australasia was
built in Melbourne by a policeman, who was
a coachbuilder by trade. This was Constable
Jimmy Bysouth, “a short, bow-legged man,
always at high pressure, and constantly
engaged in fierce encounters with larrikins.”
He thought his special services ought to
have been rewarded with promotion; but
somehow it never came to him.

AFRAID TO BE SHAVED.
A prisoner refused to be shaved
Bv the gaol barber grim,
Afraid the knight of the larther
Would murder him ;
The soap and the razor
He would not face
And a struggle between him
And a warder took place;
Six months were added
By stern Dr. Cole
To the dreary sentence
Of the poor nervoi s soul.

The Deadly Submarine
Of all the engines of war, the submarine is just now
very much in evidence. It may be of interest to know
that \ie motive power for submarines when travelling
on the surface is motor spirit, large quantities of Pratt’s
brand being used for this purpose. When submerged,
however, the power and light are derived from electric
storage batteries, which have previously been charged
by the motor-engines above referred to. This use of
electricity permits of movements under water without
the tell-tale exhaust of a motor engine, besides pre-
serving the purity of the atmosphere in the submarine
—thus enabling long journeys under water to be made.
N.B. —Pratt’s enjoys the full confidence of the
>. Allies, who are using it in enormous quantities.

IN BANANA LAND
Queensland’s clerics are appealing to the
public to try the effect of two minutes’
prayer for peace daily at noon.
“De Oriel”: I name Halifax (N.Q.) as
the most cosmopolitan settlement in the
piebald North. Chows and Japs run the
shops, Dagoes have the hotels, and all shades,
of niggers do the wages jobs. Italians rent
the cane farms, and on some of the sugar
properties separate families herd in the same
house.
Now even the President of the Water
Board has turned dog on the city’s supply.
The catchment area covers some 4000 square
miles, quite a lot of which is not protected
from dying animals and garbage-carters. The
handy old war is alleged to have delayed
the erection of a purification outfit; but the
Water Board threatens at last to wake up
and complete its plant for extracting spectres
and other wild animals from the supply.
The other day a Brisbane policeman swore
that he bought a bottle of beer from one
Horrigan, who had no right to sell the neces-
sary commodity. Horrigan sat dumb till
the constable had finished swearing. Then
he arose and handed up four telegrams and
half a dozen letters to say that on the date
in question he was in Sydney. He added
that if that lot wasn’t enough he would get
a dozen more. The P.M. decided that it
was full measure, and asked to see the
budding commissioner again. That zealous
young spirit, however, had been thinking over
the matter, and returned to volunteer the
information that it was all a horrible mis-
take. But supposing Horrigan had not
been able to prove that he was in Sydney
at the time he wasn’t selling illicit grog in
Brisbane, what would have happened to him ?
Incidentally, what’s going to happen to the
other party?
“Wunbo”: “Alamon” (B. 10/12/T4) is
quite right. The Aboriginals Protection Act
isn’t worth a twopenny blessing as far as
North Queensland is concerned. I don’t
know about the Northern Territory, but hear
that things are still worse there. Here, in
the Gulf, the Act appears to be enforced, in
only one particular, and that is in relation
to Binghi’s “dough.” The so-called Protec-
tors carefully gather up three-quarters of the
black-boy’s wages, which are generally about
10s. per week. When a station manager re-
cently applied that more of the pay might go
to his boys and less to the Protector, he was
told that 2s. 6d. per week was ample for the
natives, as they had nothing to spend money
on, since stations had to find them in every-
thing ; moreover, they can always draw
their “savings” from the Protector if they
want anything useful. Evidently they never
want anything useful, so the “savings”
accumulate. Where the money ultimately
goes no one seems to know or even care.
Meantime the boys draw 2s. 6d. per week,
and as much more as stations like to give
them in the way of bonus. It is a pity the
accumulated “savings” cannot be used to run
an institution for old and worn-out blacks,
or to help defray the cost of efficient admin-
istration or do something useful.
This is not Bananaland’s first attempt to
get to the cannon’s mouth. Little Stan-
thorpe sent 14 men to the Crimea, of whom
only six returned.
“Politicus” : “The actual culprits escaped
any injury, but a shell dropped into a hut
and killed a woman and two children.” This
is not a tale of German atrocities, but an-
account of a “punitive expedition” to the
Solomons. Now that we see the shameful-
ness of German methods when applied to
English coast-towns and Belgium, isn’t it a
fair thing to register a vow that never again
will we sanction the methods hitherto adopted
by our own punitive expeditions in the
Pacific Islands?
A note from the back of Mitchell
I can ride and shoot, and have as much stomach as
most. As tar as I know I am healthy, and I am
young. All told, I have written six polite letters
almost praying to be taken into the ranks as a bush-
man or a “skater.” The replies I received were
certainly not encouraging. Three of my epistles were
ignored altogether; the answers to the others were
practically the same, viz., that all vacancies had been
filled. I am still open for engagement in any shape
or form, so if any anxious importer who is bellow-
ing for more men can get me the colors he can
wire me direct. I’ll pay the <spst of the wire.
IN OUR BOARDING-HO USE.
THE ELDERLY CULTURED SOUBSTER: “I have a scarab that is 5000 years old.”
THE FLASH YOUNG MAN: “ Ah! A schoolprize?”
Minister Paget has just informed his
Mackay constituents that he is retiring from
politics. In his six years of office he has
put more lines through Parliament, opened
more lines, promised more lines, and left
more lines unstarted. and unfinished than
any predecessor. He has lived through the
fat years, when credit was good and Cohen
was kind ; now when Cohen is unkind and
there is £12,000,000 of lOU’s falling due, he
retfres gracefully. Paget knows when to
run in out of the wet.
From “The Understudy”
Rumor, mostly arising from the Public Service,
has it that Minister George Appel will resign his
portfolio. The story goes that he has beep con-
fronted with remarks which he is alleged to have
made in German in 1893, and he is asked to
harmonise them with his recent boast that the Appel
tree: was Huguenot. It is hinted, too, in more or
unreliable circles, that Attorney-General O’Sul-
livan may resign before the deluge sweeps Den-
ham’s Cabinet away. Railway Minister Paget’s
retirement is definitely announced. Denham, by
the way, has hurried to Sydney. Officially it is
announced that he has gone on “a private mission ;
unofficially it is understood that he is discussing
vital matters with the C.S.R. A general election
is to take place in two or three months.
The A.U.S.N. lately went out of the Glad-
stone-Townsville mail contract; the Howard
Smith (Australian Steamships Ltd.) taking-
up the running with the Cooma. - The
A.U.S.N. has held the contract ever since
the railway was opened-^—held it for' years
with, the fast, hot Barcpo (Luilt more for
the North Sea than Barrier Reef waters),
and then with the disappointing Bingera. It
was, taking all circumstances into account, one
of the best services in the world. A man
could leave Melbourne on Wednesday, even-
ing at five and be in Townsville before day-
light on Monday—roughly 1700 miles rail
and 500 miles of sea. Losing 15 hours in
Townsville, so that the local pub might sell
the traveller beer and sandwiches, Mel-
bourne to Gloncurry was covered between
Wednesday night and Tuesday night-—5OO
miles of sea and 2200 miles of rail, of which
more than half is narrow gauge, in 131
hours of actual travelling; an average of
over 20v»miles an hour for combined boat
and rail. It doesn’t sound big beside the
record of the 20th-century express that
runs from Chicago to New York, but for
years it has been an achievement for the big
State with the little population.
“J. 8.5.” in defence of the North: —
Col. Holmes, back from Papua, has been giving
his opinion about an island of which he knows next
to nothing. He says it is not a white man’s country,
and is only valuable for its cocoanut possibilities.
Apart from the fact that what was formerly Kaiser
Wilhelmsland is probably rich in oil and gold and
other minerals, the country that is not fit for a
white man is not fit for any kind of man—black,
yellow or red. The nigger suffers just as much from
malaria as the white man, and more than the white
man from other so-called tropical diseases. The
white man has, however, got into the habit of look-
ing on the nigger as so cheap that when a few hun-
dreds of him peg out through dysentery or malaria
no notice is taken of it; but if half a dozen bleached
men break down through malaria, helped on by lack
of exercise, unfiltered water, and possibly over-indul-
gence in grog and meat, the country is condemned as
not being fit for white habitation. If, then, what
was German Papua is not fit for the white man
we have no right to ask or suffer any other kind
of man to go there. On the contrary, if we want to
make it useful, the white man is the right man to
send, because he can, and does, make the unhealthy
country healthy, whereas the colored person never
does. I write, let me add, as one who was born in
the tropics and have lived my life there.
Why?
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
’Tis not because he’s short or lame
Or lacks the proper measurement,
Nor yet because he fears the game
May not be all for pleasure meant.
He nightly sings “I fear no foe,”
And, since the case is clearly so,
Will someone, pray, in kindness say
Why doesn’t Blenldns go?
He loathes the Kaiser and dilates
With daily vim and clarity
On every move—and how he hates
The Teuton’s mad barbarity ;
He says : “The Allies soon would mow
A swathe of death to Russian snow
If they but did as I would bid” —
Why doesn't Blenkins go?
He struts about and shakes his stick
And wonders why they dally so;
When Prussia’s down and battle-sick
Why give her time to rally so?
But —French is weak and Joffre’s slow
And Russia’s late with ev’ry blow —
Will someone, pray, in pity say
Why doesn’t Blenkins go.
’Tis not because his family’s big;
No youngsters cause him harassment;
His bank account is tight and trig,
And brings him no embarrassment;
His income’s good, expenses low,
There is no hindrance that I know
To keep him, yet he stays to fret —
“Why doesn’t Blenkins go?
QUEENSLAND.
F. B.
QUEENSLAND GOSSIP.
Brisbane, January 28, 1915.,
My Dear Thargomindah,—
News from England details the strenuous
life our erstwhile Governor, the chieftain
Macgregor, M.D., is leading. His health,
which had broken down, is improving, and he
is doing his bit for the Empire by mending
wounded soldiers. The Vision is assisting
him. A.D.C. Talbot has had no luck. He
was captured by the enemy.
The Voice breathed in Albert-street Metho-
dist Church on Wednesday, when Mabel
Woolcock changed her inherited name and
agreed to share the one belonging to William
Henry Bernard. Mabel is one of our tallest
maidens, and when she swept down the gang-
way, with her husband towering above her,
there was a general sigh of admiration. The
bridesmaids, Hilda Clarke and Linda Thom-
son, both cousins, wore amber ninon gowns
with violet-decked hats and bouquets of the
same flowers. Thomas Currie and Victor
Hicks gave their moral support to the bride-
groom. Barrister J. L. Woolcock (the uncle
of the bride)' and his wife were kept away
by the sudden death of Mrs. Woolcock’s
father. The newly-elected husband earns a
crust and butter with the Bank of Aus-
tralasia. His home will be in Sydney.
Mrs. Glynn Connolly, whose orange blos-
soms have hardly had time to fade, gathered
in a few of her girl friends and liberally fed
them as a compliment to Miss Mollie Ter-
rier, who is about to chance matrimony.
The shipping Warehams will leave for
Melbourne shortly, to say so-long to son
Graham, an earnest and .enthusiastic, young:
officer who takes his business of soldiering;
seriously.
Victor Joyner has just “shouted” an en-
gagement ring for Nell Paget, the only
daughter of W. T. Paget, Hie Bailway Minis-
ter. She is a pretty, dark-eyed girl, with a
tuneful voice and a capable mind. _ She is as
dexterous at pie-building as she is at argu-
ing a point with a Cabinet, and any man who
exnects more than that requires discouraging.
Soldiers’ wives who went to Melbourne to
wave teary handkerchiefs to hubby are com-
ing back gradually. Mrs. Moon returned to
Sandgate last week, Mrs. Cannan has joined
the parental party on the Downs, and Mrs.
Theo Koch, who quite recently was the
attractive Addie Green, is visiting Colonel
and Mrs. Koch at Laidley, where Koch pere
manages the Q. N. Bank.
The Osterley passenger list contains an
unusual number of Queenslanders’ names.
Mrs: Buckland Taylor, who has made her
home in England, returns to give an eye to
the family possessions in Bananaland. The
Cockburns, finding a war-darkened London a
dreary place for the tourist, and ascertaining
that daughter Betty’s voice has been ade-
quately polished, are also homeward-bound.
The Friths. -of Rodwa-y Park, and the
Alfords, of St. Andries (at one time he was
Mayor of Toowoomba), have felt the call of
the bush and hasten thither. Journalist
Lees returned last week by the Runic.
Miss Violet Paget, who recently girded a
sword upon her husband and sent him. to
join his regiment at the front, is keeping
herself busy by organising a benefit for sol-
diers’ wives.
Yours affectionately,
AUSTRALIA JANE.
“Rangan”: The way of the transgressor
in Bananaland is about to be strewn with
police dogs. Commissioner Cahill has halt
a dozen in training, and a public display
a short time ago roused a section of the
Brisbane press to enthusiasm. Thus : ‘ After
tracking the culprit the dog, with a trium-
phant bark, sprang, and fixed his long, white
teeth in the bagging.” (The culprit was a
well-padded policeman.) Also: “Barking
furiously the dog flew once more to the
attack and bit and tore witli terrible earnest-
ness. One could readily imagine the fate
of a man so beset.” I don’t know whether
the animals satisfy themselves before tearing
a man to pieces that he is guilty or merely
suspected by an intelligent John Hop. Still,
after all, that’s a mere detail.
“A.P.F.” : We’re a simple, trustful people,
we Bananalanders. Even the lepers move
about amongst us on what has been described
as “a sort of parole.” Five have been
released from the lazaret at Peel Island, and,
as they report themselves at intervals and,
nobody has noticed any alarming symptoms,
they will remain at large. Of course, as
the Courier casually remarks: —
This does not imply that any cure has been found
for leprosy. It is altogether too soon to say there
will be no recurrence of the disease. On the other
hand, the comparative liberty enjoyed by the inmates
who were released does not constitute any risk to
the general public.
The Courier further encourages confidence
with the information that “from the begin-
ning of medicine leprosy has been an im-
penetrable mystery.” No doubt, though,
when it becomes commoner, we’ll know more
about it.

“Newsreader”: It is a little startling to
find how readily one accepts the newspaper’s
haphazard valuation of news and life. Just
because it isn’t sprawling all over the paper,
I find myself taking a ten-seconds look at the
record-breaking Italian earthquake—a dis-
aster which, in the good old days before the
war, would have been flung gt the public in
many columns and received with reverence
and the usual relief funds. But dead non-
combatants and ruins don’t matter now. I
realised that, when I read the following, in
my respectable paper, which used to have a
proper regard for human life and propputy:
At the most, a Zeppelin raid on England—even if
the ships of the air could succeed in eluding the
vigilance of the British airmen —would create a
momentary panic, and perhaps kill a few civilians, as
in the case of the naval raid on Scarborough and
Hartlepool.
Civilians seem to be about as valuable as
rabbits now.
* * * *
The tired sub-editor’s grievance:—
According to the English Who’s Who for 1914
“William Walker, M.L.C., J.P., practising solicitor,
born at Glasgow February 26, 1828,” is still living
at Windsor, N. S. Wales. As all the Oldest Inhabi-
tants in the Ma State know, the ancient William
died in 1908. The same reference book gives the
Rev. William George Lawes, D.D., as among the
living, whereas he was buried at Waverley over seven
years ago. I wonder how many more pitfalls there
are for weary sub-editors in this standard reference
book?
* * * *
An Adelaide High Church parson has
received courteous assistance from the
Register. “Matins at 11,” he called it.
The paper went one step further, and called
it “Matinee.”
The Inky Way of Belgium is a perished
track now that the Gerhog is burning things
generally. Two papers of some importance
survive. One is published in London. The
other keeps its name alive by hiring a page
in the London Standard.
“E.D.”: Bean’s work is being availed of
by newspapers far less than was expected
by the Government when he was appointed.
The chief reason is that parsons, whom the
Government is already paying up to £960
per annum for accompanying the expedi-
tionary force, have entered into competitions
with the official war correspondent. Tift
cleric, who has rushed off on a colonel’s
salary, is able to supply regular copy at a
cheaper rate than that at which a paper Can
get Bean’s staff, and at a tenth the co&t of
sending a man of its own. The sky-jmlot’s
copy may be amateurish, but the jcdirnal
publishing it can claim exclusiveness for the
drivel, and may head it “From our ovjh war
correspondent.” The writer knows at least
one metropolitan daily now doing this, in a
State where Bean’s matter is not seeing
print. Meanwhile old hands at the journal-
istic game have been pushed out of theif jobs
by the war, and the A.J.A. has had to
collect a benevolent fund to help them over
stormy times.
* * * *
“Sr.”: Hobart dailies have no regular
column under which to insert matrimonial
advts., so the public demand for a better
(or worse) half figures sometimes under
“Excursions,” sometimes as “Amusements,”
and occasionally even under “Lost and
Found.”
“Ricardo” : Treitzschke, the great inspirer
of German ambition so often quoted since
the war began, was a member of the
Reichstag from 1871 to 1888. He was too
deaf to hear anything; so he sat next to the
shorthand writers, and tj-ained himself so
well that he could read every man’s notes as
he took them.
An item from the Advocate and Times
(Tasmania) :
Petrograd, Sunday, 2.5 p.m.—A semi-official re-
port states that the Russian fleet fought Breslau, the
capital of Prussia in Silesia, on January 6, inflicting
serious damage. They destroyed a number of the
enemy’s steamers, and sailing vessels at Sinope,
Trebizond and elsewhere on January 8, and at night
bombarded Kliopah.
It is so beautiful that Comment falls down
dead, and Rejoinder gives everything up as
a bad job and files its schedule —assets, two
muddles in the £.
* * * *
“Pica De Vinne” : The oldest hack in har-
ness on S. Australia’s Inky Way is Captain
David Drysdale, who, despite his 70-odd
years, still plies an energetic pair of scissors.
The gallant old captain (nobody seems to
remember what he was captain of) controls
the West Coast Recorder, of Port Lincoln,
and makes a readable paper of it. Over half
a century ago he worked on the Castlemaine
Leader (Vic.), and moved thence to Port
Augusta, in those days a thriving place, and
established the Despatch. That was in
1877. tie was Mayor of the town whenever
he wanted to be, and made a hobby of rifle-
shooting. Incidentally, his was probably the
first paper in Australia to barrack for com-
pulsory military service. He started on the
subject soon after the Despatch was born.
He still takes his place at the butts, and can
manage a “bull” as well as most youngsters.
A HOPEFUL SIGN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
Who Stole Ah Duck’s Trousers?:
—Evening gager headline.
The war is getting rather dull and news is scarce and
thin,
So small accounts of brighter things to print are
dropping in ; ■
While frozen Europe waits entrenched the Spring
rush of Yen Kluck,
There comes a six-inch yell: “Who stole the trousers
of Ah Duck?”
The Dove of Peace, a far white speck, comes winging
down dark skies ;
It bears no tiny olive branch to gladden hopeful eyes,
But, streaming from its eager beak (its grip it won’t
release),
I see Ah Duck’s symbolic pants—the long-lost Pants
of Peace!

The Royal Commission
in their final report oh Tuberculosis,
recently issued, clearly showed that
the chief danger to child life resulted
from the use of infected cow’s milk.
To quote one extract : “The Evi-
dence ym have accumulated goes to
demonstrate that a considerable
amount of the tuberculosis of child-
hood is to be ascribed to infection
transmitted to children in meals
consisting largely of tne milk of
the cow.”
When the mother’s milk is not
available, the “Allenburys” Foods
form the best substitute; as they are
practically identical with healthy humah milk
in composition, nutritive value and digestibility,
and are absolutely free from all harmful germs.
Milk Food No. I. From birth to 3 months
Milk Food No. 2. From 3to 6 months
Malted Food No. 3. From 6 months upwards
The ‘Allenburys’ Rusks. A
valuable addition to baby's dietary
wnen ten months old and after These
Rusks are specially useful during the
troublesome time of teething. When
eaten raw they mechanically aid the

AN/EMIA
and Debility
JF you are run-down, easily exhausted andout
of breath—if you feel slack, depressed, or
“out-of-sorts,” start a Course of Iron
‘Jelloids’ at once. Iron ‘ Jelloids ’ are the
finest and most reliable tonic for all cases of
Anaemia or Debility. They quickly restore
vitality, and produce the rich healthy blood so
essential to good health and vigour. Iron
‘Jelloids’ are a perfectly safe remedy under
all conditions —pleasant, inexpensive, do not
harm the teeth, and are non-constipating.
Dr. Andrew Wilson wrote:—
“ It can be definitely stated that Iron ‘Jelloids’
constitute the most effective and desirable
treatment for the cure of that common com-
plaint, that insidious and weakening condition,
no matter from what cause arising, known
as Anaemia or Poorness of Blood.”
A fortnight's trial (Price 1/6) will convince you

,f,n? f >ri f i v al co - was formed in the late
f S to take over a business founded in the
far-west backblocks of N. S. Wales bv
Edward Rich, who started it with a
hawker s van, so the story nuns in the
mulga. Bad times—horribly bad times—
came to the saltbush shortly afterwards;
and Presently Dalgety’s took the thing
over. Ihe dry-nursing was so satis-
factory that in 1911 the Dalgety
directors retired from the Board and the
control was shifted back to Australia. Since
then radical changes have been in progress.
Edward Rich died, and his place as manag-
ing director was taken by the Brisbane
manager. _ Evidently the directors at that
time had in view a more vigorous attack on
Queensland. J his has been the general
trend of things during the past two or three
years gradual realisation of assets in N. S.
\Vales and gradual extension in Queensland!
Rut the realisation has been more rapid than
tlm extension, with the result that the once
badly waterlogged concern now owes only
altogether, while its assets include
Cash, £16,268; book debts, £81,240; pro-
etc., £59,762; merchandise stocks,
£<l,_o6. Only as late as 1911 the liabilities
ran to over £77.500; but at that time there
was over £140,000 worth of goods on the
shelves. The disclosed profit hasn’t aver-
aged more than about 41 p.c. on the capital
during the past six years; yet the accounts
claim that the capital is intact. Probably
the trouble has been that the goods, which
have been sold in vast quantities, haven’t
brought 20s. in the £, and those losses have
had to bo made good out of current earnings?.
Ir so, since this clearing-out process must come
to an end very soon, there ought to be better
figures ahead, especially if the Queensland
business turns out anything like the man-
agement expects. And there’s no doubt
been a heap of money/made, and there’s still
a heap to. be made, in the back-country
supply business. Further, it is distinctly a
business in which the big profits go to the
people who can afford to see two or three
bad years out; and Rich’s are putting them-
selves in a position to do that.

Last year (1914) prices started low, and not
knowing how things would turn out, many
of the farmers sold their wheat forward at
anything up to 3s. 6d. If a mill bought
at that price, it ought to show good figures
for the current year, presuming, of course,
that the farmers had any grain to deliver;
some of them hadn’t. Prospects for the
current year therefore depend on whether
the co. got all the wheat it wanted at 3s. 6d.
or 45., or whether it is paying ss. plus exes.
In ordinary years the business is- largely
gamble, as the profit column shows. But the
dividend calls for only £569, and by drop-
ping even that when it wasn’t earned, the
co. has built up a respectable reserve of
£9488. Consequently it is now in a position
to stand a few hard knocks without taking
the count. Liabilities amount to £6242,
mostly an advance from the Commonwealth
Bank for wheat buying. Against that there
are mill, machinery, land, etc., valued at
£15,881; stocks worth £5311, and other
assets (chiefly liquid) totalling £6497.

“Queenslander” : lie State Enterprise for
the development of the New Guinea oilfields
(B. 14/1/T5). Although not opposed to
Government action if properly organised, still
the fact remains that so far the Common-
wealth Government has made a mess of oil-
prospecting. A boring plant in Queensland
is expected to average 3000 ft. a year, includ-
ing time occupied in moving the plant and
making the necessary repairs; and on that
basis the Commonwealth plant has not
earned its salt. Apparently our Australian
drillers were not good enough for the job,
although I am personally acquainted with a
dozen men who have done vastly better work.
Dr. Wade may be a first-class chemist; but
if he is also an engineer one can hardly
understand his recommendation of a rotary
system. On the water-flush
system has forced the oil back into the
veins, filling them up with sand and cuttings,
and the bores have been abandoned as not
payable, when others put down in close prox-
imity with the ordinary churn drill have
proved payable, and have, moreover, induced
a flow in those put down by water-flush sys-
tems. I know the water-flush system is used
in Borneo, Sumatra, etc., to a depth of
1500 ft.; but after that the excessive weight
of tools and rods makes it impracticable. At
least that is the experience of the Dutch co.
which now owns most of the wells.

The B. H. Prop, isn’t the only one in the
Australian iron and steel business. The
Hoskinses, who took over the Sandford mill
at Lithgow, are not dead yet. In fact, they
are so well supplied with, orders that they
are building another furnace. Nor has New-
castle all the advantages. If the Hoskinses
were starting afresh they would still choose
Lithgow, with iron and limestone as well as
coal almost within shovelling distance. But
there is plenty of room for the two, seeing
that annually we are paying the foreigner
£4,000,000 for iron.

Beauty and policemen seem to me, somehow, in-
trinsically antipathetic. They are as far apart as
butterflies and hippopotamuses, or the Law of Torts
and the Pastoral Symphony.
—An artist in Melbourne Argus.
FIVE nights agone I lay at rest
On my suburban couch.
My trousers on the bedpost hung,
Red gold within their pouch.
The twin-gods Law and Order seemed
To me all powerful as I dreamed.
My life was staid, my rates were paid,
And peace was in my mind.
Nor recked I of unruly men
To evil deeds inclined —
Strange, primal, atavistic men
Who shock the peaceful citizen.
But all the same, by stealth he came,
A man of vile intent.
What cared he that my life was pure,
Or that I paid my rent?
He willed to violate my shrine
For household treasures that were mine.
He planned to thieve my household gods,
Heirlooms of divers kinds.
(I cannot understand such men,
Nor fathom their dark minds.
Why cannot they abjure all vice,
And be respectable and nice?)
With purpose vile and with a file
My window he attacked.
; A stealthy scratch upon the catch
Awoke me to the fact.
Softly, with sudden fear amazed,
A corner of the blind I raised.
I saw his face!... . Oh, that a man
His manhood should degrade,
And seek to rob (I checked a sob)
Except in honest trade!
A predatory face I saw
That showed no reverence for Law.
With whirring head I slid from bed,
Crept from my peaceful couch ;
Forsook my trousers, hanging there,
Red gold within their pouch.
Out through my chamber door I fled
And up the hallway softly sped.
Into the murky night I stole
To seek a certain cop,
Whose forthright feet patrol the beat
A stone’s throw from my shop.
In my pyjama suit went I. . . .
Across the moon dark clouds swept by.
I saw him draped upon a post,
Like someone in a swoon.
His buttons gleamed what time the clouds
Released the troubled moon.
He gazed upon the changing sky,
A strange light in his dreamy eye.
“Now, haste thee, cop!” I called aloud,
And seized him by the arm.
“There is a wretch without my house
Who bodes my treasure harm.”. . ..
Toward the sky he waved a hand
And answered, “Ain’t that background
grand?”
“Nay, gentle John,” said I, “attend.
A thief my household gods
Seeks to purloin. Go, seize the man
And scourge his back with rods !”
‘‘Those spires against the sky,” said he
“Surcharged with beauty are to me.”
“/ give the man in charge /” I cried,
“He is on evil bent!
He seeks of all its treasured art
To strip my tenement!”
He answered, as one in a dream,
“Ain’t that a bonzer color-scheme?
“Them tortured clouds agcn the moon,”
The foolish cop pursued,
“Remind me of some Whistler thing;
But I prefer the nood.”
Said I, “Come, seize this man of vice!”
Said he, “The nood is very nice.”
“My pants,” cried I, “unguarded lie
Beside my peaceful couch —
My second-best pair, with the stripes,
Red gold within their pouch!
Thieves ! Murder ! Burglars! Fire !” said I.
Sighed he, “Oh, spires against the sky!”
Then, in my pink pyjamas clad,
I danced before his eyes.
In anger impotent I sought
His ear with savage cries.
He pushed me from him with a moan.
“Go ’way!” he said. “You’re out of tone.”
“Why do I pay my rates?” I yelled.
“What are policemen for?
Come, I demand, good cop, demand
Protection from the law !”
“You’re out of drorin’, too,” said he.
“Still, s’pose I’d better go an’ see.”
I guided him a-down the street;
And now he stayed to view
The changing sky, and now he paused
Before some aspect new.
And thus, at length, we gained my gate.
“Too late !” I cried. “Alas, too late!”
Too late to save my household gods,
My treasures rich and rare.
My ransacked cupboards yawned agape,
My sideboard, too, was bare.
And there, beside my tumbled couch,
My trousers lay with rifled pouch.
“Now haste thee, cop!” I called again,
“Let not thy footsteps lag!
The thief cannot be far away.
Haste to regain the swag!”....
His arms I saw him outward fling.
He moaned, “Where did you get that
thing?”
With startled stare I looked to where
His anguished gaze was bent,
And, hanging by my wardrobe, saw
A Christmas Supplement—
A thing I’d got for little price
And framed because I thought it nice.
It was a Colored Supplement
(The frame, I thought, was neat).
It showed a dog, a little maid—
Whose face was very sweet —-
A kitten, and some odds and ends.
The title, rather apt, was, “Friends,”
‘ Accursed Philistine !” I heard
The strange policeman hiss
Between his teeth. “O wretched man,
Was I lured here for this?
O Goth! Suburbanite! Repent!
Tear down that Christmas Supplement!”
And, as athwart my window pane
The tortured storm-wrack swept,
He bowed his head upon his hands,
And wept and wept and wept. .. .
So, on the whole, it seems to me,
Art and policemen don’t agree.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THE Minister for War stood with his
finger half an inch from the small
vulcanite button. His face was
grave and pale, and in the tense silence of
the hot noonday the great electrician
watched him as he posed and hesitated.
Roses were blowing in the garden without,
and the strong summer sunshine streaming
in through the window fell upon the compli-
cated masses of clockwork and wix - e that
filled three-fourths of the large room. A
full minute the Minister stood with his
finger in suspense, holding his breath and
pursing his lips. Then his hand fell to his
side and he turned to the inventor.
“I have only your word for this. How can
I tell that the result will be as you say?”
The inventor grinned a slow, contemptuous
grin.
“What are you afraid of?” he said. “If
the thing is a fake, as you pretend tio
suppose, what harm can you do by pressing
a button? Tush! What weak nerves you
politicians have. For five _ years I have
foreseeb this moment, appreciated the deadly
effect of my work, and toiled on without
flinching. You want proof of the truth of
what I say? With my record of achievement
you ask me to give guarantees of my good
faith?”
The statesman had sunk limply into a
chair.
“Forgive me,” he said larnOly. “I do not
doubt your ability. I should be satisfied —
but —but —it is a terrible responsibility.”
The inventor had lighted a cigarette, and
now rose and began manipulating his strange
machine. He touched a lever here, a handle
there until the hands upon the great dial
were shifted so as to point to other numbers
and signs. _
“You want proof,” he said. “You shall
have all the proof you need.”
I-Ie consulted a map and further adjusted
the indicator.”
“Take that ’phone and ring up your
Intelligence Department. Ask them to put
you in touch with any of your more powerful
wireless stations.”
Mechanically the Minister took up the
receiver and spoke. The electrician looked
out of the window, his hands deep in his
pockets.
“I’ve got them,” said the Minister.
“Tell them on their lives to get into
communication with the great Russian plant
at Kizil Arvat.”
“Where?” said the statesman.
“Kizil Arvat. Oh, I suppose you never
heard of it! Never mind. Give them the
name. They’ll know about it. Kizil Arvat
—K-i-z-i-1 A-r-v-a-t. Now ask them what
the weather is like there.”
The Minister looked up with a frown.
“This is absurd. Surely”
“Oh, certainly it’s absurd if you don’t
want the proof I promised you.”
The inventor yawned wearily and threw
himself down in a chair.
“For God’s sake go back to your casualty
lists and your public orations. Lord, I wish
I had a man to deal with. Napoleon would
have understood. I believe I could get the
Kaiser to comprehend. Nicholas the First
would have jumped at my offer.”
The Minister crumpled up under the great
man’s attack. The inventor had as great a
reputation in the world of science as
Napoleon’s own in the world of action. He,
the head of a department of State, was only
the passing favorite of the democracy.
“Oh, if the matter is serious and you really
wish it, I’ll inquire about the weather at
Kizil Ararat by all means.”
“Kizil Arvat. Do please. Impress upon
them its urgency.”
The statesman spoke through the ’phone.
“Anything else?” he inquired.
“Nothing. You’re sure they understand.”
“Yes.”
“Now I’ll give Asia some weather.”
The inventor stepped to his machine and
touched the button. Somewhere on the roof
above was heard a crackling as of a thousand
small squibs fired simultaneously.
“Come out into the garden,” said the
wizard of wires. “The atmosphere here is
bad for your nerves. The attendant will
call you when the ring comes.”
He linked his arm in that of the statesman
as he rose, and together they passed out into
the vine arbor.
Once in the open air the electrician’s
manner entirely changed.
“Come and see my carnations,” he said.
“I have had some success at hybridisation,
you know. This is real work for a man.
There is something godlike in this —to
change the form and nature of a living thing.
The other,” waving his hand towards the
house, “is a matter of calculation and induc-
tion ; here the great creative instincts have
play. There is not so great a distance
dividing the god who makes a world or two
and the man who fashions entirely new
flowers. But the play with forces we can
control and regulate—tush, it will be child’s
play to our children’s children.”
The statesman followed his guide blindly,
professing wonder at this, admiration of
that; and then the call came on the ’phone.
“Kizil Arvat reports the most terrific
thunderstorm, ever known. Clouds gathered
out of a blue sky. Seventeen villages are
supposed to have been destroyed. The loss
of life is not yet known. The storm passed
within one league of the ivireless station .”
“Are you satisfied?” asked the inventor.
“I needed no proof,” murmured the states-
man.
“Gather me the latest information of the
disposition of the enemy’s forces.”

WHILE SAWING.
“While sawing my hus-
band inflicted a nasty
wound in his left hand
with the s,aw,” says Mrs.
F. Reid, of Fleet Street Devon-
port, N.Z. “The wound in-
flamed and festered up, and
stubbornly refused to heal,
notwithstanding the various
remedies and treatments we
tried.
INSEPARABLE from the rough, tearing work
of the workshop, railroad, farm or cattle-

which may be neglected once too often. Zam-
Buk has brought to the worker new possibilities
in “first aid.” Clean the skin round the wound
or cut, and promptly dress the injury with Zam-
Buk. Zam-Buk does more than allay pain and
inflammation; it prevents festering and blood-
poisoning, and heals up your hart quickly and
perfectly. Zam-Buk is wholesome, and contains
none of the rancid animal fats that make old-
fashioned ointments so risky and useless. When
you cut or scratch yourself the best thing to do
is to apply Zam-Buk, the powerful antiseptic
and healer.
FLYING CHIP CAUSES PAINFUL WOUND.
AS among the tree-fellers and timber-getters, so
in your backyard, chopping wood is not free
from danger. This is illustrated in the case of
Mr. Daniel Connell, of Hollingshead Street, Botany,
Sydney, who says: “While chopping wo'od a flying
chip struck me on the leg, causing a nasty wound.
The part became swollen and very inflamed and pain-
ful, and looked so bad that I feared blood-poison
would set in. For seven weeks I was laid up with my
leg, and all the treatments I applied to - the wound
were useless. Finally I happened to come across
Zam-Buk, and applied a dressing of this splendid
balm. The first application gave great relief—stopped
the swelling, allayed all the inflammation and eased
the pain. Continuing with the treatment of Zam-Buk,
in a surprisingly short time my leg was completely
healed.”
“At length we happened across Zam-Buk, and were so encouraged with the marvellous benefits
derived from the first applications that we continued to apply this excellent balm. Zam-Buk drew all
the bad matter out of the sore, allayed all inflammation, finally healing- up the place with clean,
healthy skin.”

Home-made Beauty Helps
and Money-saving Recipes.
By RITA MOYA.
It is quite impossible for me to give advice in these columns regarding the merits of
various preparations on the market. In general, my advice to women who wish to retain,
or regain, their youthful appearance is to avoid the many unreliable, cheap, made-up pre-
parations. Nature provides many simple “beautifiers,” and the best results are obtained
from their use. You must not be disappointed if you experience a little trouble in obtain-
ing some of the ingredients mentioned below. They can all be obtained, however, from any
reliable chemist, and even if he does not happen to have them in stock he will gladly
obtain them for you at a few hours’ notice, if you insist —and you should insist. The
smart, dainty woman of to-day likes to know what she is using.
Sure Way of Permanently Removing:
Superfluous Hairs.—The usual hair removers
on the market I have found not at all satis-
factory. I recommend the following prepara-
tion. It is really wonderful in its action,
destroying hairs completely in a few moments.
Many women have merely a down on the arms
and face, and imagine they do not need a
hair remover. They hardly realise what a
wonderful difference there would be in their
appearance if this down, even light as it
may be, were removed. Get at any good
chemist an ounce of pure powdered pheminol.
Mix a little of it into a paste with water and
apply it to the hair growths. Wash off after
two minutes and the hairs will have entirely
disappeared. A little non-greasy face cream
can then be applied with advantage.
Powder Not Necessary.—Few women know
that it is possible to give the complexion a
delightfully smooth, velvety appearance in a
few moments by the application of ordinary
cleminite. If you have no cleminite in the
house, get about an ounce from your chemist
and dissolve it in four tablespoonsful of cold
water. This lotion applied to the face, neck
or arms, with the finger tips, immediately
gives that peach-like bloom so much admired;
powder is not necessary, and the result lasts
all day long. For an evening in a hot ball-
room this recipe is unrivalled. You will not
get that greasy, shiny look so often seen after
a little exertion.
Natural Wavy Hair.—You hair will regain
its rich lustre and fluffy appearance if cleansed
occasionally With a mild shampoo. The very
best thing I know of for this purpose is plain
stallax, a teaspoonful of which dissolved in
a cup of hot water is sufficient for the thickest
growth of hair. Pure stallax, however, seems
rather expensive, as it is only sold in the
original packages which cost half a crown.
This quantity, nowever, is sufficient for 25 or
30 shampoos, so it really is most economical
in the long run. Dry, irritating or profusely
oily scalps are soon put in a healthy condi-
tion. and dull, brittle hair grows bright and
even in color, and will be ever so soft and
fluffy.
Hair Culture. —There is no excuse for falling
hair; no excuse for thin, sick hair, or bald
spots. No beauty of features can make up for
a distressing lack of hair growth, and the
formula which I purpose giving you will posi-
tively force the hair to grow. Mix about an
ounce of boranium in J-pint of bay rum,
shake the bottle well and allow it to stand for
half an hour, then add i-pint of fresh cold
water and strain. Rub well into the scalp,
and in two weeks’ time look for the new
growth; you will not require a microscope to
see it.
To Renew Complexions without Cosmetics.
—lf the excessive user of cosmetics only
knew the impression her artificiality really
makes upon others, she would quickly seek
the means of gaining a natural complexion.
Let her acquire the mercolised wax habit, dis-
carding make-up entirely, and she will soon
have the kind of complexion that women envy
and men admire. It is so easy to get a
little mercolised wax from the chemist and
use it nightly like cold cream, washing it off
in the morning. Gradually the lifeless, soiled
outer cuticle peels off in tiny invisible flakes,
and in a week or so you have a brand new
complexion, clear, soft, velvety and of girlish
color and texture. The treatment is so simple,
harmless and marvellously effective the won-
der is that every woman whose skin is with-
ered and discolored has not already adopted fL

Again the statesman went to the ’phone
and the inventor to his handles and levers.
At four o’clock the plant was in readiness.
“Will you do it?”
“Yes.”
Trembling, hesitating, pale to the lips the
Minister of War again hovered with up-
lifted finger over the button.
With a harsh laugh of contempt the in-
ventor pressed the linger down upon the
vulcanite and threw 'the politician from him

Overhead the wireless apparatus crackled

back in his chair and covered his face with

THE TRAGEDY OF BABETTE’S
NIGHTIE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“/"YOU !” Babette the bride gasped, as we
® v snuggled down in the reserved car-
riage and shook the confetti out of
our hair, “I’ve forgotten my nightie !” Then,
tragically : “My wedding nightie !”
It is all very well to make rules about
marriage. When you are married you find
that marriage makes its own rules —about
you. Babette and I, once we had got over
the slight awkwardness of feeling really
engaged, formulated a very definite pro-
gramme for our marriage. At least, I sug-
gested the programme, and Babette cordially
assented. Looking back on that period, I
now see that Babette, in her position—usu-
ally on my knee —was apt to assent to any-
thing. It shortened the intervals between
kisses.
“Love is blind,” I carefully pointed out.
“The gravest risk in married life is that the
parties are apt to forget that. They cruelly
remove Love’s blinkers, and naturally Love
shies. When people see too much of each
other, even when they are safely married”
“Oh, but,” Babette ecstatically cried, “I
could never see too much of you, dear. And
I thought,” she went shyly on, “that mar-
riage meant that you did see quite a lot of
the girl you married.”
“That’s the very danger I’m afraid of —-
that you’ll see too much of me.”
“I couldn’t,” Babette said simply. “And
you’ve got to see a good deal of me, haven’t
you—sometimes ?”
I explained gently that I didn’t mean that.
“Qh !” Babette seemed relieved.
“What I mean is that there shouldn’t be
too many—details,” I explained. “You know,
keep up the illusion.”
"But there isn’t any illusion about me.
I’m real, aren’t I?”
Judging by the impression Babette was
making on my knee there was no doubt about
that. “But my point is that it isn’t neces-
sary for a wife” —-— I had to interrupt my
ai'funient when I said “wife.” We always
gave each other a kiss when the words “wife”
or “hhsband” were mentioned. It seemed so
wonderful that we could use such exciting
words —“It isn’t necessary for a wife to give
herself away to her husband.” (Another in-
terruption). “All he need see is the effect
she —not how she gets it.”
“But I’ve got the duckiest trousseau,”
Babette earnestly said.
“Oh, I’d love to see it all, darling,” I hast-
ened to say. “But that’s the very reason
why you shouldn’t let me. You must remain
a mystery even to your husband” (Tause).
“Keep me perpetually wanting to know all
about you.”
“I could do that,” Babette hopefully mur-
mured.
“But you’d spoil it all if you let me.”
“That’s harder,” Babette adnlitted. “But
I don’t really see why I shouldn’t.”
“The books —I’ve read quite a lot of books
about love and marriage.”
“All written by foreign women who’ve
never even been kissed, who’ve never had a
baby, and I don’t think have ever been mar-
ried even once.”
“Perhaps; but that’s what they all say.”
“Well, I’d just like to ask those women
who write those silly books what’s the good
of getting married if we’re going to remain
comparative strangers.”
“Oh, hardly that!” I protested. “But each
of us, though married, has the right to our
own privacy.”
Babette detests general terms. She likes
to discuss things, not propositions. “I see,”
she said, suddenly illuminated, “you mean,
I shouldn’t see you in your shirt? I think a
man in his shirt looks so absurd, don’t you?
It’s curious, too, because a girl in her nightie
looks rather fetching, don’t you think? But
.of course you don’t know anything about
that.”
1 I did not contradict Babette. I couldn’t.
“But I’d certainly be dreadfully shy.” she
went softly on, “if you saw me when I was
getting undressed. But I suppose even in the
best book-regulated marriages that sometimes
happens.”
The note of shyness in Babette’s tone
almost suggested a note of hopefulness.
I hastened to reassure her. “It won’t hap-
pen in our marriage.”
. _ “Oh!” she said ; and a look of determina-
tion appeared on her innocent face. On
looking back. I am not sure what that deter-
mined look really meant.
You will see from this verbatim report of
lone of our many discussions that Babette
and I were quite modern. We believed in
perfect frankness —with, of course, the neces-
sary reservations —at least, on my part. We
had even settled the awkward ouestion
whether, when we were married, Babette
would really like to have a little pink baby.
I thought then that new babies were really a
delicate shade of pink.
Babette answered, with a slight hint of
shyness, that she had not given the matter a
thought. She was quite prepared just to go
on loving me and being a sympathetic wife
and cooking my meals and darning my socks
.... but. .. .yes. . . .since 1 had raised the
question. .. .in a few years or 50.... when
she-’d got accustomed....
But our beautiful scheme was smashed on
our wedding-day. In the rush of changing
into her going-away costume from her
given-away costume a bride always
iorgets something. Babette was the first
bride in history to forget the most essential
necessity for a comfortable honeymoon.
She made a hurried, despairing search in
that reserved carriage. The nightie had not
been packed.
“But you’ve got others?” I hopefully sug-
gested.
“Yes, all packed up for the sea-trip, and
left at home till we go.”
We had, in our innocence, by sheer luck
avoided the worst pitfall of the honeymoon.
We weren’t going to catch the steamer till
three days later. A sea-sick wedding night
is the worst catastrophe that can hapnen to
anybody. It is even worse for the one who
isn’t sea-sick.
We had selected a charmingly secluded
boarding-house on the sea-side, miles from
anywhere, and even lacking a telephone, to
spend the first three days of our honeymoon.
And we were even out of reach of nighties.
“My wedding nightie!” Babette moaned.
“All made of pink baby-ribbons and —well,
that’s about all it is made of. It’s all your
fault!” She broke down. Yes, she wept
on her honeymoon. (I didn’t know then
that all brides do.)
And when she blamed me —exactly why I
forget—l knew that I was married. The
solemn vows we had taken that day, the wed-
ding breakfast, the speeches and the toasts,
even the easy manner in which Babette kissed
every available young man in the room, had
not given me the sense that I was really
married to my Babette. But when, beautiful
in her tears, she turned on me and put the
blame on me, the sudden conviction came that
this was the real altar and the real Wed-
ding March. She put the blame on me.
That is what a husband is for.
We wired, of course, at the first stopping-
place ; but we knew that there was no chance
of the nightie arriving for at least two days.
Two nights ! Babette wrote the wire. “For-
got indispensable garment. Send at once.”
She said her mother would know.
Then I saw another aspect of the case.
“It’ll put the people at the boarding-house
quite off the scent,” I said. “A bride
arriving without her nightie ! It has never
been heard of before. The landlady is sure
to find out; and then nobedy will suspect us
being honeymooners.”
Partly by my argument, partly by other
means known to the newly-wed, I cheered
Babette up. She agreed that the mystery
of the missing nightie would materially
assist us in our deception.
We had been very clever about that. When
I wrote asking for the best double-bed room
i.n the house, the landlady had replied stating
the terms, and adding: “Children 15s. a
week extra.”
In deep consultation with Babette I had
drafted my letter in reply. I wrote a post-
script: “We have decided to leave the two
children at home this time ; but if we like
the place we will bring them on our next
visit.”
But the cleverness of this manoeuvre was
altogether overshadowed by the mystery of
the missing nightie. The only thing, I
reflected, was that this astounding forget-
fulness of Babette —for which, now, she
blamed the chief bridesmaid —made it much
more difficult to preserve the modesty of
our married life.
It is curious to reflect that I cannot
recollect what sort of nightie Babette wore
that night. She told me the next morning
that she had borrowed the best the, landlady
had. She also told me that luckily she had
brought some pinky ribbons and had man-
aged with their assistance to make that
garment almost bridal. She had also im-
proved the “V.” I cannot recall either the
pinkiness of the ribbons or the improved
“V.”
It was very awkward, too, to preserve our
personal privacy in the one double-bed room
we had engaged. But we did it, heroically.
In the evening Babette, on the pretext that
she was goin <r to her room to look up a
time-table book, slipped away....and did
not come back. When I went for her she
was in bed. She hurriedly turned her back
on me and buried her nose in the bed-
clothes. And in the morning I rushed down
for a bath, and on my return was met by
Babette in a new frock.
The only unfortunate incident of our brief
stay occurred when we were leaving. We
had heroically kept up the deception that
we were an old married couple. We / had
spoken anxiously of the two children, left
in the kind care of Babette’s aunt. We
wondered if they missed their “mummy”
and their “daddie.” And when we were
saying good-bye the landlady cheerfully re-
marked, with a smile for the assembled
boarders: “I do hope you’ll bring both the
children next year. And I hope, we all
hope, that before then you’ll have decided
upon the sex of your two children. It’s so
confusing to strangers when the mother
soeaks of her two darling little girls, and
the father says that the elder is a boy.”
“There!” Babette said, as we drove away
covered with public ignominy, “that comes
of letting a man interfere about children,
ft was pretty lucky for you. too, that I was

was only five months’ difference in the ages

a year and five months. But— —-it would

But it was when we took the steamer for
the real honeymoon that our great marriage
ideal was smashed. Babette had recovered
her wedding nightie, and even wore it: but
she was a wretched sailor and sick all the
way.
I had to constitute myself Babette’s nurse.
I had to lift her from her bunk, steady her to
the couch, brush her hair, wash her but-
ton and tie and hook and safety-pin her up.
I had to find garments beneath a foam of
other garments in her cabin trunk. I bad to

What an Old Timer
Says:
“I always specify “ PemfngtonrUMC"
when buying cartridges be-
cause I believe there is no
way to judge of the future
except by the past; and many years of
experience in shooting all kinds of shot-
gun cartridges and ball ammunition have
convinced me of their absolute reliability.
I have always used PemingtonrUMC
ammunition with complete satisfaction.”

The
Importance
Of
Efficient
Insulation!
Tlie importance of efficient insulation, in many cases, is not realised. Great
care is shown in the selection of a steam plant to ensure the greatest economy,
yet the insulation which is of equal importance is in many cases partly neg-
lected. If you strive to make a saving in the steam consumption of your
engine, why not make certain that it is not wasted again through faulty in-
sulation? The claims we make as to the exceptional efficiency of Newall's
Coverings are fully borpe out by actual test. and. further, by the enormous
sales, including repeat orders, and we do not know of a single instance where
any other covering has been used once NewalUs have been tried.
The Ultimo and White Bay Power Houses are insulated throughout with
Newall's Coverings, and this material has also been adopted exclusively by the
N.S.W. and Victorian Governments. These are facts which will tend to* fur-
ther prove our claims. The innumerable advantages of this material over all
other forms of lagging are described in interesting booklet, which 'we will be
pleased to mail you along with samples.
