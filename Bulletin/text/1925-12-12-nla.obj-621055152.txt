I agree, sir, a cigarette isn’t a
matter of life and death. But a
Kensitas, sir! I have heard a gentle-
man say, ‘‘l’d give the world for
another Kensitas! ”

The unique quality of
Kensitas Cigarettes
is only possible at
the popular price
because in the case of
Kensitas that price
has not to cover the
cost of pictures, prize

Life to Be
WHEN I am dead (if so it be
I die on land, and not at sea)
I’ll richer be in death than life;
For, oh behold, I have no gold,
Though riches round about be rife,
Nor do I own a stick or stone ;
And though I share the light and air
With all who live and breathe around,
I do not own an inch of ground.
Great peace I’ll have, strange peace and
new—
No rent to pay, nor tax, nor due;
For I shall mingle with the soil
Wherein I lie, and by-and-bye
Become as it, no more with toil
And care oppressed, in utter rest;
My house my own and mine alone,
Rent-free, with not a coin to pay,
From burial hour to Judgment Day.
Though Life deny me certain things,
Yet Death, that sable king of kings,
More just than Life, shall prove my friend;
For I shall have within the grave
Sure peace and slumber without end;
Full stretched at ease, with nought to tease
And vex the heart, a woven part
Of earth herself, her fair design ;
Though dead, new interests shall be mine.
For, while the sun and stars revolve
By day and night, I shall dissolve
And change anew from hour to hour;
Though dust and dumb I shall become
The things I love —tree, grass and flower;
In scent and hue I shall renew
My life on earth; at each re-birth
I shall appear as something strange
New-fashioned by the hands of Change.
When I am dead I shall be free
To speed in chainless liberty
Through Nature, evermore alive;
I shall persist in rain and mist,
And when the wintry winds arrive
On sullen coasts, and, pale as ghosts,
With bated breath men speak of Death,
As though Death were a thing to fear,
I shall be smiling somewhere near.

Midnight in a Library
No sooner does the departing librarian
turn the key in the lock than the library
breaks into a mild insurrection. It
becomes its own master; and as there
is scarcely a book that isn’t bursting
to talk, the place is soon humming like a
hive. And no wonder they wag their tongues.
For it is a repressed existence they live
jambed into the narrow shelves listening to
the inanities of the patrons who borrow
brainwork at fourpence a time.
As well as a Communistic discontent each
volume nurses its own particular grouch
against readers—or more often against the
scarcity of readers, as the sneers of dusty
tomes headed “Classics” give testimony. Take
Sir Walter Scott, for instance. There is a
whole row of him—up near the roof. His
carping is echoed by Bulwer Lytton,
Thackeray, Lever and others of that period.
“Aye, truly,” mumbles one, “I am never
read. Yet am I unimpeachable as to print
and binding, with as pretty a frontispiece
as one could wish for. Is’t fair, then, or
seemly, that I should lie unsought? Is’t fair,
sirrah?”
“Prithee, peace, gentle sir,” says Lady
Mary, peeping from the leaves of “Beau-
caire” ; “’tis but. a pusillanimous age we live
in. Or die in, I fear. But ’tis not fair; no,
by my dowry, ’tis not.”
“Is’t fair?” mimics the Range Boss, jovi-
ally, from his front seat on the table. No,
Old Timer, it ain’t. Yet, with doo respect
to age, your day is done. You’re through.
Get me? The public ain’t got time nowadays
for Cavaliers an’ Roundheads. What it
wants is Condensed Meat. Now I give ’em
that, and they cut and come again. I’m an
“In demand,” I am. Thar ain’t no dust
pilin’ on me.”
Sir Walter and his friends make no pre-
tence of listening, but withdraw with
hauteur. Really the books in demand nowa-
days ! Poltroons ! Scum ! Not an aristocrat
among them! New, that was the fault —
new!' Better be dusty, old and unread than
new.
Their old sides shrink as they draw to-
gether for comfort, and more than one
binding cracks in a fresh place. Taking on a
more aquiline look they sulk and sneer—
hard.
But none cares, for the Range Boss is still
boasting; and, really, some of the more
recent works seem to find the fellow’s vul-
garity amusing. “Yep, I’m a most-wanted.
You know my hero-ine. You’ve often met
the little lady. American. Breezy as her
own prairies. Great at slingin’ pancakes,
an’ love. Full o’ pep, an’ daring as the
Devil. But clean. Clean. You know her.
Who doesn’t? And slick with a Colt —
keepin’ the Bar 41 outfit at bay. Gee, she’s
grit an’ girl all through! What she an’ me
can’t do ain’t worth recordin’. I’m runnin’
to my tenth edition already. I fill the whole
winder at Mullens’s. Two whole winders.
You all know my publicity, don’t you? Me
leapin’ a gorge, an’ snatchin’ me girl from
the crook’s car”
“Hold on tliar, you’re poachin’,” growls
Texas Kid. “That’s my poster you’re describ-
in’. It’s me saves the girl from the Rolls
Royce. She’s mine. My villain’s a mining
magnate, snoopin’ round my girl’s ranch,
striking oil, or tin, I forget which, but it
don’t matter a half-dollar either ways, be-
cause I race the car to the old shack and
there rescue my college-eddicated, domesti-
cated, swanky, simple, wild-an’-gentle boy-
girl from the magnate’s clutch—an’ shoot
him full o’ lead at the same time. Now
your girl’s in the clutch of Injuns. Whad
you goin’ do about it?”
The Range Boss, silenced by a past-master
at his own game, is silent. Strange that he
had forgotten the plight of his heroine, but
there it is!
So Texas Kid resumes. “Talk o’ best
sellers, ain’t I It? Just look at this edition
of myself, dirty, ragged, maimed in the back
from too much handling. But it’s the price,
the price you gotter pay for popularity.”
“Forsooth, madam, methinks there speaks
a braggart,” simpers Mistress Kitty Bel-
lairs to Prudence Palfrey, who responds
primly with “Pride ever goeth before a fall.”
“Talk of popularity,” cries a prominently
displayed book that now takes up the run-
ning, “what about me? No flies, eh?”
“Who is. speaking now?” inquire several
at once with arrogant condescension.
The speaker’s identity established, the
better bred shudder. “Ugh! It’s that fast
thing in the striped cover,” whisper the
women-writers of a past day. “The one that
is er-er-er—you know. Hot”
“ ‘Hot stuff’? Yes, that’s me,” amiably
allows the striped one, snatching her scorch-
ing title from her detractor’s lips. “I am
hot stuff. Full of ginger, as a favorite ought
to be. I’m not a lady and don’t want to be.
I never dabble my fingers among the water-
lilies, never crumble a biscuit. Cigs., cock-
tails, lipstick and late hours —that’s my line.
I’m hot stuff, so say what you like,” she con-
tinues defensively, though really there had
been no disclaimers.
Still they all rather disapprove of her.
Even those noble lads, the cowboys, are not
sufficiently broadminded to let their ranch
girls feed on “hot stuff”; for when the
Western maid is finally saved from outlawry
her metier is the making of cookies and
doughnuts. The cowpunchers realise this,
and to allow “Hot Stuff” on their premises
would endanger the manufacture of these
national foods. Still, in a furtive way, they
admire the bold creature in the striped cover,
and listen respectfully.
“Say what you like, I’m hot stuff, and
not ashamed of myself either. Though it’s
a funny thing,” she muses, “most of my
readers are frightened to stand up for me.
Hide me inside a tame novelette, or carry
me inside their suit-cases along with the
manicure set and the sandwiches. And my
sheiks and bedouins don’t like it. What’s
the use of having features of carved bronze,
and gem-covered hands, and then be shut up
from sight? That’s what I call dirt.”
“Ah, Literature, Literature, what crimes
are committed in thy name!” moans a sepul-
chral voice from the dust where philosophers
hobnob with the dramatic authors. It is
Eugene Aram who makes moan, but an irri-
table “You misquote, sir, you misquote,”
checks him. With a demand for silence,
Bulwer Lytton continues: “By my halidame,
I will recite the passage, that these chatter-
ing braggarts with whom we are herded may
haply benefit thereby.”
“S’truth!” ejaculates the herd, “head him
off, somebody. Count him out! Gag him!”
shout cowboys and million-dollar heroes with
one voice. “Those old bores on the top shelf
are always butting in. They ought to be
shot full of lead. Who wants to know any-
thing about literature? What is literature,
anyway ?”
Here “Every ingh a man” chips in. He
also claims populai’ity, in a measure. “Read
every year, I am,” he explains, “and by
the boarding-house and camping-out crowd.
You all know me, With my keen-faced suc-
cessful _ American stalking the Rockies
frontispiece. You see, I look well strapped
on the luggage, for I’m a good-looking book.
Or, rather, I was. Consider this edition of
me; covered with grease from chops fried
in camp, spotted from candles in tents. My
vitals torn out for pipe-lights. Beer stains.
Ring-marks from ale glasses all over me.
Popularity marks.”
“Why,” cries a pert voice from the
librarian’s table, “none of you best-sellers’
come up to me for darn popularity. I’m in
my fourth edition and the flappers all crazy
about me still.”
“Dear, dear,” interjects Jane Austen to
Charlotte Bronte, “what a forward chit!
Who is the child?”
“Oh, one of those 1925 brats. The last
best-seller! Surely you’ve heard of her, and
her story of love and hate. No? Well, you
surprise me, Jane. I should have thought
the hectic thing would have penetrated even
your cloisters. Why, her title describes her.
‘Burning Love/ with a couplet:
As the desert’s burning sands
My love consumethl”
“Love? Burning love? How dare she
discuss such a thing!” says Miss Austen,
faintly. “Love was diluted to decency in
my day.”
“Yes,” responds the other; “even I put
Cupid into rompers, so to speak. But not
now, my dear, not now. He goes bare these
days. Yet listen, the creature speaks again.”
“Popular? Yes, I should say,” continues
the shocker. “The world’s mad about me since
I’ve been screened. Yet the fillum version
of me is nothing to what I really am. Me,
the unexpurgated me—why, don’t you know
I’ve been censored?” she shrills ecstatically.
“Flappers are buying me at double price.
And some of their mammas just love me too.
You see it’s my hero, Don Carlos, with his
bold, compelling gaze and his sinews like
rippling silken ropes beneath his dusky skin!
He’s a human magnet, that’s what he is—
with a fascinating unholy power. And, just
between ourselves, Don Carlos is making
trouble in the home. He’s got the drop on
old dad and is making him look like a tame
rabbit. Don Carlos can ‘veil his eyes with
passion till they smoulder.’ Dad can’t do
that because he wears specs. He doesn’t
even try to do it. But he sees Carlos turn-
ing the burning eye on mum from page 244
and then he begins to sizzle, too, with
jealousy. Oh, I’m wonderful, just wonder-
ful. I’m in love with myself, and Don Carlos
is a he-vamp. Yet being a best-seller is
not all joy, is it, Hot Stuff?” she asks
plaintively of the fast wretch in the stripes.
“Best-sellers of our type have a dull time
of it, hidden away under mattresses or m
the lingerie cupboard, in case Mother gets
to know.”
“Yes, and our leaves smeared with lipstick
and chocolate,” assents the other, “poor
darlings of the boudoir public that we are’ ;
and then adds: “D’you know, Burning Love,
sometimes I would almost rather be‘ poor
old Shakspeare thete, rotting away in peace
on shelf seven.”
“Too right,” sighs Hot Stuff, “though
they say even he was a scorcher in his day
and had to be well sieved before the young
things were allowed”
Crash!
At the sudden noise all the books lost the
power of speech, and the librarian, opening
the door upon another day, stumbled over
the pieces of an old volume that had leapt
from shelf seven and fallen in pieces.
As. he turned the suicide over with his
foot. Hot Stuff and Burning Love whispered
toeother guiltilv. “Well, if it isn’t poor old
Shakspeare! I do hope we didn’t hurt his
feelings.”
WEEROONA.
Bohemia
Sliakspeare’s Bohemia had a sea coast;
the Bohemia that we used to know compro-
mised between truth and Shakspeare by dip-
ping its rugged outlines in a sea of beer. It
was, and it is, a magical country which
ceases to exist when once we have turned
our backs upon it; that is a fact of which
a forceful reminder is given every time I
meet one of the Old Bohemians who re-
mark, with a sigh, that there is no Bohemia
any more. They have paid off the time-
payment furniture; they own their own
houses and employ other people to “do” the
garden; some of them—quite a number of
them —own motor-cars in which they take
their wives and children for decorous excur-
sions on week-ends.
Before he struck the habit of indulging
in ventures which were financially profitable,
George Taylor, now the energetic proprietor
of a series of business papers, and of the
Soldier, whifch is probably the most lady-
like paper with a name like that on earth,
published a book entitled “Those Were the
Days,” In those times it was a joke to us,
who were of Bohemia, to see George Taylor
looking back on Bohemia as on a land that
had vanished. It was more of a joke than
ever when Taylor wrote to a “returned”
artist about doing some work for the Sol-
dier. The Digger called, and was extract-
ing a cigarette from his case when George
said in a tone of mingled, pain and horror:
“Oh, you cannot smoke here!” The artist
pocketed his cigarette and when he joined
me presently and told me about it he added
with a chuckle, “So this was Bohemia!”
To-day it is that artist who repines for the
loss of Bohemia —his Bohemia.
Little more than a year ago I was intro-
duced to the studio of a trio of aspirants for
a footing in the world of various arts in
Sydney. They slept one on the floor and
two on rough trestle beds; did the work
they felt the world wanted and usually found
that it did not; shared the money of the one
amongst them who happened to have the
luck of the day or the week. To see the
two who were not fortunate draping the
pavement outside the building into which the
lucky one had gone to collect such fortune
as might await him was edifying. As they
were habitually without the means of satis-
fying the rent promptly, the landlord was
a joke to them. Having nothing to anchor
their habits, their habits were cheerfully
irregular. As a reaction to days when beer
and counter-lunch took the place of meals,
sumptuous feasts, eaten off tablecloths of
.newspaper and with the irreducible mini-
mum of table implements, were noisy and lull'
of rough merriment. Having nothing to b,
careful about they cared for nothing; they
were Bohemians of as distinct a t3 r pe as
any we ever knew, and they mixed with
Bohemians something like themselves. But
one is already drifting away on a sea of
t.p. furniture from Bohemia; and in a few
years they will all be saying that Bohemia
lias ceased to exist.
The association of Beer with Bohemia is
more a matter of circumstance than any-
thing else; it is a fallacy to regard the con-
nection as essential. Some of the best
Bohemians I have known were very
moderate drinkers or did not drink at all;
some of the worst were the grossest boozers.
The fallacy that the two are inseparable is
imbedded in the minds of many young aspi-
rants for inclusion in the kingdom; but
their drinking is a pose, and to the true
Bohemian pose is anathema —as it was to
that old-time editor of the Sydney Daily
Telegraph who, having been induced to
give some attention to his clothes, arrayed
himself in a frock coat, but paused in the
street and parted its tails in order to strike
a match in the old way. In my Bohemia we
drank because we were poor and because
we felt for the poverty of our friends who
were poorer and could give them solace only
with the cup that wakened laughter, and
buried the landlord, and drowned the bailiff.
Frequently the word was whispered round
that poor Blank had failed completely that
day, and had drawn not a bob anywhere;
and our five shillings, half-crowns and shil-
lings went in to give him something to take
home with him. We did not blame him if
he spent a large part of the subscription in
shouting all-round. We might blame him
now; but, then, Bohemia has slipped from
under our feet.
I think it was Fred Broomfield who, moved
to the heart by the recollection of the mone-
tary disappointment of the “poor Blank” of
that afternoon and the sad condition of his
children, journeyed out late at night with a
parcel under his arm, dropped it on his friend’s
doorstep, and, having rung the bell, fled so
that his friend would not know who was his
benefactor. The unfortunate one, coming to
the door, found, as if it was a gift fallen
from Heaven-—a lobster and a bottle of beer 1
The benefactor’s ideas of what was essential
to feed a starving family had got a trifle
mixed. But his heart was right.
The stories of the doings of Bohemians
have many duplications. There is the classic
of how Harold Gray (“The Pilgrim")
entered The Bulletin office one day with
a sad face and started to talk in the phrases
of grief until it was drawn from him that
Victor Daley was dead. Of course lie left
with a cheque to meet the immediate necessi-
ties of a family left destitute. Daley, missing
the joyful Gray, and being foggy as to
whether it was he or Gray who was to be
dead, came in later and began grieving about
the lamentable death of “The Pilgrim.” The
joke was so good and it had turned out so
profitable that it was tried many times and
with many different people as the corpse,
though thereafter with better management.
Once, after an interview' with W. B. Mel-
ville at the stage-door, Harry Norman con-
veyed the intelligence to Bland Holt, then
appearing at the Royal, that Henry Lawson
was dead and a subscription list wms going
round for his family’s benefit. Bland Holt
sent a note to liis treasurer to hand out 20
good sovereigns to the cause. There was balm
in the Gilead of Bohemia that night. Heaven
only knows how mjich good cash the old trick
has extracted altogether. , .
How to deal with bailiffs . (bailiffs being
a standing joke in Bohemia) is the theme of
many stock Bohemian stories. The classic
Daley yarn narrates how, a bailiff being in
his house, sundry friends made carnival at
the Daley mansion and friends with the
broker. When that limb of the law awoke
with a sore head in the morning he found
the house emptied of furniture —even the
linoleum had been removed- from beneath
him, and he was lying on the bare boards.
A more recent story concerns an artist m
whose house a writer-friend was staying.
Something approaching a quarrel arose be-
tween them, and in a vicious moment the
artist explained matters to his friends.
“Harold’s all right,” he said, “but he takes
too much upon himself. One day when 1
was absent a bailiff came to my house, and
Harold threw him out. And he wasn’t his
bailiff —he was mine !”
Some of us visit now and then the shores
of a country which the people who dwell in
it call Bohemia. But it is not our Bohemia.
Every man who ever lives in Bohemia brings
it into the world with him ; and it begins to
fade away the very first moment he wonders
whether some bright vision in muslin that
he is apt to meet will notice that he hasnt
changed his collar.

She Speedometer—first
and foremost.
The first “extra” the manufacturer thinks of placing on his car is the
speedometer, and it is the accessory the discerning prospective buyer
looks for first.
Ihe first care of the car-builder, seeking those extras that nowadays
count for so much on a car, the speedometer remains, for the car owner,
the foremost of all accessories.
The car-maker no sooner thinks of speedometers than he is forced to
realise that one name —Stewart—occupies in his mind a place all its own.
It occupies that place by sheer weight of numbers, the numbers —running
into millions that he and other builders have fitted to their cars in times
past.
In the British Isles, in German}', Russia, the Scandinavian countries,
in all those countries bordering the Mediterranean, in India, China, Japan,
from north to south, and from east to west of the Americas, in New
Zealand, here in this big Australia—wherever, in fact, there are
communities of civilised people there are to be found cars —hundreds of
thousands of them—-running in the service of mankind and fitted with the
Stewart Speedometer, that faithful recorder of speed and distance.
The speedometer that is the recognised standard of the world is the
speedometer that should be on the car you buy.

Black Elephants.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THE travellers are home again across the
lazy sea,
With dreams along their lashes and
a laughter on the mouth;
Their feet have trod the North ways, and
their feet have felt the South.
The world Avas theirs for plundering; yet
nought they brought to me
Save little coal-black elephants Avith tusks
of iA'ory!
In teeming Eastern harbors
Beneath the pulsing skies
They stood on piled-up counters
With rainbow merchandise
Under old red-striped aAvnings
In streets with narrow stairs
Among the trade and barter,
Among the spicy airs.
And in all the golden glamor
And through all the hot, white clamor,
Was the AAuzenedsweet-meat seller crying,
crying out his wares.
From stalls of burnished copper
And shouting scarlet beads
And golden-leafed tobacco
And flutes as fine as reeds
In many-voiced Colombo,
In ancient, rich Bombay,
Their dusky vendors sold them
Into the far-away.
Blue gloom of shadowed arches, past a little
bustling quay;
The scent of rose-filled gardens, and a
step-rail blurred Avith rust;
Old streets Avitli Avhite-A'eiled Avomen and
the strange, sad smell of dust —
Such scenes of far enchantment do they
conjure up for me,
The little coal-black elephants Avith tusks
of ivory.
Oh, I would that they had brought me
Just an English daffodil
Picked from a morning meadoAv ■
When all the Avorld was still!
Or a slender-fashioned cowslip
That a baby-breeze might shake
From a copse that heard the cuckoo,
Singing, singing, half-awake,
In the warm and windless liolloAvs,
Flecked Avith flights of glancing swallows,
That had held the seaward-ringing voice
and fearless tread of Drake !
I Avouhl that they had brought me
A strip of tattered sail
That told of herring-fishers
Racing home a Cornish gale !
Or (had they, roaming, wandered
Past all the Avee Avhite toAAms)
A silver-tinkling slieep-bell
Lost on the rolling Downs!
Oh, avlio Avould bring a daffodil across the
Avide, wide sea?
Oh, avlio AA r ould wrap a song around a piece
of Devon loam ?
“They’ll Avant a little elephant, the folks
who stay at home ;
The neighbors all have elephants.” And
so it had to be,
The little coal-black elephants Avith tusks of
ivory!

Pudding and Pie.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
DECKED for a banquet, tlie big dining-
room of the old hotel that had
housed, fed and sometimes put to
bed with their boots on more than a couple
of generations of bushmen, mining-men,
engineering-men and seafarers was rapidly
filling with a gathering of guests as varied
m personality, character, beliefs, tempera-
ment, appearance, age and worldly condition
as it had ever in its long career contained.
Ihey came in with laughter in their eyes
and their voices, and a certain aspect, eager
and expectant, that was common to all, of a
realisation that this night was to be, of all
nights of the year, the happiest and most
joyous for each and every one of them. It is
not often, in this tiring life, that man is per-
mitted to go back carefree into adolescence
—veritably to become a boy again—but that
was what all those who entered the big
dining-room of Pharaoh’s Hotel in Sydney
that December evening were looking forward
to doing. Sixty, fifty, forty, thirty, twenty, ten,
five years—even twelve months —of life were
to be shoved back that night by those who
greeted one another there, until they 1 should
live again and happily in the splendid second
decade of human existence whose charm and
beauty is never altogether realised until it
is left behind. It was little wonder that
grim faces were relaxed and jolly faces be-
came jollier and gloomy ones more serene.
There are not many opportunities for this
sort of thing—as all old boys of all schools
know—between the ages of 21 and 80. It
was the annual dinner of the King’s School
Old Boys’ Union.
One long table stretched down the side of
the room opposite the entrance, and before
it were many smaller ones whose snowy
cloths were crossed diagonally by blue and
white ribbons. The long table was for the
president of the Union, the headmaster,
members of the Council and the Old Boys’
committee, judges, generals and colonels,
bishops, bosses of banks, K.C.’s, Macquarie-
street doctors and other prize-winners of the
post-schoolboy period. At the other, grouped
tor the most part according to the years
when they had pervaded Parramatta, an
assortment of diners seated themselves whose
ages varied between four- and one-score
years.
Three of us sat together who had been
schoolfellows a generation before—not a
schoolboy’s generation, but a man’s. The
fourth, a wliite-bearded and sun-tanned old
jester, who was the father of one of the
others, had “been there” a little more than
30 years before our time. “L1.K.,” as his
son called him, was easily, that night at any
rate, the youngest of us all. And the best
looking. Though that is saying little.
He was, lie told us, in his 81st year, and
had been at the school from ’54 to ’Ol. There
were only two contemporaries of his present
—the brothers Michael, who were about his
own age. Pudding and Pie they were, he
said with a chuckle, and Pudding was the
elder of the tAvo. There they were, over on
the right of the long table, as happy as Larry
together. But they hadn’t ahvays been so.
Hadn’t spoken to one another for years. His
own nickname? Well, it Avas not a very re-
fined one. He had been christened YelloAv
Belly, because he Avas supposed to resemble
a Chinaman. But it was many years since
he had been called that.
All the evening we listened to him while
he told us, betAveen the toasts and the
speeches, the story of Pudding and Pie.
* * * *
“When I was brought doAvn to Parramatta
by my father, to be put to school, 1 was ten
years old, and could read a little, but couldn’t
write. That was a wonderful journey to me
on top of the coach, across the range above
Murrurundi, doAvn the Hunter Valley to Mor-
peth, and then by sea to Sydney. It was a
family joke for years how my father asked
me what I thought of the ocean, as Ave passed
out of the river at Newcastle, arid how I told
him it was like Breeza Plain. We came to
the old Woolpack at Parramatta late one wet
night, and next morning my father tooK me
across the dam to the school to see the
headmaster, Mr. Armitage. God bless my
soul —that’s a good while ago! Let’s see.
SeA’enty years, eh? Well, well!
“Of course I was a A«ry little chap—but I
think we started life earlier in those days
than they do iioav. I Avas nearly 17 Avlien I
left school, and the next year I was manag-
ing YelloAv Hills, up in Ncav England, for my
father. When I w T as 21 I had a run of my
own on the Darling DoAvns—Packsaddle
Creek. But I Avant to tell you about Pud-
ding and Pie over there. The one on the
right’s Pudding—him Avitli the long white
beard. The clean-shaved one's Pie, and lie’s
extraordinarily like his father, old Major
Michael. I expect Pudding would be, too, if
it wasn’t for the beard.
“When Ave came to the door of the head-
master’s cottage the Major Avas saying
good-bye to Mr. Armitage. A very tall man
he was—the Major, I mean —with Dundreary
whiskers and a fierce red face.
“ ‘Lick ’em, sir— lick ’em ! Belt the devil
out of ’em,’ he Avas bellowing. “They’re both
young deAdls. If you don’Uliek ’em, they’ll
LIVING BY JAZZ ALONE.
I don't mind where it is at all, Tom—Lolita's on at the Panaro, the Candors are dancing at Hurley's, and
Belle Montano's at the Western.”
"‘I suppose there's nowhere ice could get a hit of food.”
be hung. Bushrangers. Good morning to
you, sir. Thrash ’em soundly.’
“He’d had the name of being a terrible
dogger when he was Commandant at Nor-
folk Island. I heard afterwards, and I sup-
pose the only moral force lie understood was
the lash. Pudding and Pie told us that he’d
given them both a good hiding at the Royal
Hotel in Sydney the night before. Just as a
send-off, I suppose. Like most fathers would
give a tip of half a sovereign.
"Well, they were young devils. The pair
of ’em. Always fighting. Mostly with each
other—but either of ’em would take on any-
thing Perfect young scrubbers. They’d
been brought up pretty rough, amongst con-
vict servants down on Yass Plains, and could
swear like bullock-drivers. Pudding was 13,
and Pie 11. Big, sturdy boys, as strong as
young bulls.
“Their nickname? Oh, a very natural
one. Somebody asked the big fellow what
his name was, and he told ’em —‘George Por-
gis Michael.’ You know the old kids’ rhyme :
Georgie Porgie, pudden an’ pie,
Kissed the girls and made ’em cry. ...
Of course, he became ‘Georgie Porgie,’ and
the other fellow—Harry—he was ‘Pie’
straightaway. Always been a great place for
nicknames, the King’s School. If anybody,
big or little, wanted fight, all he had to do
was to sing out ‘Georgie Porgie pudney pie’
to either of ’em, and he’d get all he wanted.
Perfect young demons they were witli their
fists. After I’d left school I met a man in
Queensland wlio’d done a bit of droving for
Major Michael, and knew his station —Mun-
gabangalang—-about the time Pudding and
Pic were both little kiddies, before tney came
to the King’s School. He told me a lot about
their home life, and about Bill the Bleeder.
An old convict and ex-prizefighter who’d
worked out his ticket-o’-leave under assign-
ment to the Major. ’Twas him taught ’em
all they knew about scrapping—which was
a jolly sight too much for us. Except, of
course, the big fellows beginning to grow
whiskers. Even some of them Averen’t too
Avilling to sing ‘Pudney Pie’ Avlien George
or Harry Michael was within hearing. It
always meant prompt assault, at least.
Though there was no offence in calling either
of them by their nicknames. They recog-
nised the necessity of them in the school
Avorld.
“But they Avere fine fclloAvs, both of ’em —
generous, high-spirited, manly boys. Not
liars or sneaks. Good lads. The real Mac-
bay. Hullo, here’s the Head getting on his
hind legs. Worth listening to. Dam’ funny,
generally. I’ll tell you after....
“Oh, yes—Pudding and Pie. I’m not
gassing too much for you fellows?” The
Head’s speech had brought the house down,
as it usually did.
We assured him, in a sort of chorus, that
Ave could listen to him all night. It wasn’t
every day of the Aveek that Ave heard about
the School in Armitage’s time.
“Right. I Avas going to tell you about
their row—the toav that lasted for years.
Look at ’em now. You Avouldn’t think
they’d ever seemed to hate one another like
poison, would you? Though I don’t suppose
they ever did—really. They couldn’t have.
“There was a German master there —Dr.
Horn —who taught modern languages. A
fiery old lad he Avas —as haughty as the
Devil _ and a most wonderful swordsman.
That is to say, as far as I’m capable of
judging. He’d been a Prussian army sur-
geon, and the story Avas that he’d killed a
brother officer in a duel, and had to get out
of the country in a hurry. I don’t knoAV
Avlietlier that was true or not, but there was
no doubt he’d had a fight or tivo. He’d come
bathing Avith us sometimes in the river—
round by the racecourse, opposite Govern-
ment House, was Avliere Ave used to SAvim.
Lord, lioav many fine pears haven’t I had
out of the Governor’s orchard that used to
be in that liorse-shoe bend below the old
house ! We’d swim across, and slip into it
when Ave got a chance. One time I Avas
caught, and hauled up, just as I Avas—only
with a bag draped round my waist —before
Sir William Denison himself. But that’s
another yarn. I’ll tell it to you some other
time.
“I Avas talking about Dr. Horn —yes! His
wounds. He had a puncture through his
left shoulder, just below the collar-bone—it
went right through. You could see the two
scars, back and front. And round his right
ribs there was a bluish seam about half a
foot long. He never told us where he got
them, but one day Pie asked him about the
body wound, and he said —‘Ach, yoong Pie,
my poy, you vass doo inguisitif. Der odor
man he haf god it vorse. Mindt your pisi-
ness, yoong Pic!’
“So we knew it was a duelling wound, and
invented all sorts of yarns about him, as
boys will. He taught some of us single-
sticks and foils, and there was no doubt he
knew all about ’em, and how to use a sword.
He couldn’t understand our fighting with
our fists, and always wanted us to settle
disputes with the single-sticks. ‘Like shentle-
mens,’ he would say. ‘Nod like brudal bul-
lock-trifers!’
“But he could never persuade us to abandon
the old Australian coat-of-arms. You know
—two black eyes and a burst nose!
“He was a great social light in Parramatta
—always going to balls and parties—and
a bit of a dandy. Well, one time he’d kept
his whole class in for three successive after-
noons—over some French verbs, or some-
thing. So they made it up to take it out of
him. It was known that on a certain night
he’d be going to a dance at the Military
Barracks in George-street—there was a com-
pany there, mainly for the purpose of fur-
nishing guards for Government House, and
to look after a couple of iron-gangs that
still worked on the roads about the district,
and used to be marched out from the gaol
under a corporal’s guard.
“The day-boys brought along a supply of
rotten eggs, and some of the fellows waited
for him that evening, after dark, at about
the time when lie was due to walk across
Lennox Bridge on his way to the Barracks
from his lodgings, which were in Church-
street, on the north side of the river. There
was a street lamp—one of those old dim oil
affairs at each end of the bridge that dida i
give much light, but plenty to see the doctor
with, so that he would be egged as he passed
by it.
“About a dozen boys- —I wasn’t in it, but
Pudding and Pie were —waited for him,
hidden in some loav bushes and armed with
a couple of eggs apiece. Real ripe eggs.
And he got it —got it fairly. A terrible
mess they made of him and liis evening
clothes. Awful! Two volleys—and then
they scooted off into the dark, and back to
the school. It was just before evening pre-
paration. A winter’s night—dark pretty
early. They said the doctor aauis plastered
with putrid egg-yolk from head to foot.
“Imagine Mr. Armitage, a quiet, scholarly
man who hated disturbances, being sud-
denly burst in upon by this infuriated Prus-
sian as he sat reading in his study. Can you
think of it! The infernal stink! The sight
of Dr. Horn’s purple face ! The yellow, slimy
muck all over liis dress-suit and frilled shirt-
front ! The doctor gasping and goggling
—speechless with indignation! The head-
master getting slowly to his feet, and gaping
at his modern-languages teacher in amaze-
ment ! The dead silence between them for
a few seconds, broken only by the doctor’s
gasping breaths! Smitliers, Mr. Armitage’s
butler, told us all about it aftei-Avards. He
stood in the passage after Dr. Horn had
charged past him when he answered the
bell, and saw it through the open door of
the study.
“‘My dear Doctor,’ the headmaster said.
‘What, in the name of fortune’ —
“ ‘Schmell me, sare — sclimell me. Ach,
Gott in himmcl —schmell me ! Schwein
hunds! Gott strafe dese plackguards.
Schmell me!’
“We were all seated in Upper School just
after the bell rang for prep., when the head-
master, very pale and angry-looking, came
into the room through the door in the corner.
There wasn’t a sound. A pin dropping
would have been like a tree falling down.
We held our breaths.
“He made a fierce speech. An outrage. A
disgraceful piece of blackguardism. He Avas
ashamed of us. There were many boys in
it, he said, but he wanted the ringleaders
to stand up. Two, at least, he would have.
Unless tliey con-
fessed at once the
forthcoming mid-
winter holidays—
they were only
a week awa y—
would not begin.
Nobody would be
permitted to return
home until the lead-
ing spirits in this
disgusting and das-
tardly business had
come forward. If
there was a spark
of manliness in any
of us those most
guilty of this appal-
ling outrage would
give themselves up
to the justice they
deserved. And so
on. Very bitter.
Very sarcastic.
And very effectively
impressive, with
the threat of no
dune holidays.
It was a horribly
deadly insult in
those days to call a
man an Old Hand.
You know what it
meant —that lie’d
been a convict! Mr.
Armitage said : “I
can only conclude
that the mark of
the broad arrow is
upon you all- —that
you are nothing but
the offspring of Old
Hands!” A fearful
thing to say, especi-
ally to boys who
reckoned their par-
ents to be all Pure
Merinos. A terrible
thing for boys to
be told in those
days, when the pri-
son taint was still
pretty strong in New South Wales. We
fairly gasped at the insult.
“Fdr a long time there was dead silence.
Only the nervous shuffling of feet on the
floor, and an occasional cough. Mr. Armi-
tage stood at the master’s desk on the dais
at the upper end of the big room and glared
at us. The assistant master in charge fairly
goggled with astonishment—dumbfounded.
Five minutes maybe—though it seemed like
five hours. Then, looking round with a sort
of sneer on his face to see if anyone would
follow him, George Michael—Pudding—rose
in his place, half-way down the room,
amongst the rows of desks. Mr. Armitage
stared at him for a moment or two before
he spoke.
“ ‘Michael Primus!’ he said.
“ ‘Sir,’ answered Pudding.
“ ‘You were a Reader in this—this filthy
business?’
“ ‘lf you please, sir, I threw the first eg"
that hit Dr. Horn,’ says Pudding— not alto*
gather without a sort of flash defiance I
thought. ’
“In a moment his young brother was on
his feet.
“ ‘He’s a liar, sir! ’Twas my egg hit him
first, he fairly shrieked. ‘Hit him in the
shirtfront, sir. My brother’s telling lies.’
“Mr. Armitage glared—first at Pudding,
then at Pie. He hesitated for a little while,
unable to find words. It bewildered him
that the two boys should actually seem to
be rather proud of their share in the thing
—should seek to dispute the honor of having
led the attack on the doctor.
“ ‘Get on with your work,’ he said to the
rest of us. ‘You two, come with me.’
“We never saw Pudding and Pie again
at least, not at the King’s School. He
expelled them straight away—had their boxes
packed for them, sent them to the Woolpack
for the night, and next day sent Smithers
the butler, with two battered wrecks to
Sydney, and booked seats for them on the
southern mail-coach. It was long before


any of us knew what happened after they
passed through the door leading from Upper
School into the headmaster’s dining-room.
They simply went out —disappeared —were
no more seen. I remember quite well that
a lot of us believed they had been put in
gaol. You know how credulous boys
are. Lord only knows what we didn’t
think had happened to Pudding and Pie.
But you may bet your boots that they were
heroes. In the estimation of all boys at the
King’s School, throughout the year 1557,
there were at least three St. Michaels. And
two of them were believed to inhabit Yass
Plains.
“The first definite thing we heard was that
as soon as they had found themselves alone
at the Woolpack in a double room they had
begun to fight. Old Jimmy Snodgrass, who
kept the place in those days, told Smithers
about it. Each of them claimed to have been
the first to find the target with an egg, and
Pie was very bitter that Pudding should
have tried to cheat him out of liis glory.
Pudding was equally certain that it was his
egg that had landed in the doctor’s frilled
bosom. They made a devil of a row, and
it. wasn’t until old Jimmy called in a con-
stable from the street that they could be
separated, and locked into different rooms
for the night.
“But it wasn’t until they arrived home at
Mungabangalang, together with Mr. Armi-
tage’s letter to Major Michael, that Dr. Horn
was properly avenged. Their old savage of
a father had a whipping-post on the place
where the convict servants used to be tied
up to get a dozen or two lashes whenever
any neighboring Justice of the Peace called
at the station and was available to try them.
You know, a man couldn't flog his own ser-
vants, even if he was a magistrate. So
neighbors used to oblige one another. Of
course, by ’57 the assignment system was
a thing of the past, but the whipping-post
was still there, and the Major had the cat-
o’-nine-tails in his office, treasured as a relic,
I suppose, of his former glories. Wliat does
he do but have the two youngsters tied up
in turn and make one of the hands give ’em
two dozen apiece! What d’ye think o’ that
now ?
“About IS7O 1 was down here in Sydney,
stopping in this very pub, when I ran into
Harry Michael one afternoon in the bar
as he was trying to arrange with the bar-
maid to go for a drive with him to Botany
Bay. We knew each other at once, and lie
immediately abandoned whatever designs he
had on the girl, and hailed me with joy.
“ ‘Hullo, Yellow Belly!’ he bawls at the
top of his voice.
“ ‘Hullo, Pie!’ I sang out as I turned
round. You know how your old King’s
School name will slew you. Like a whip-
lash slews a bullock. There’s no mistake, we
were glad to see one another.
“Well, we were young men in ’seventy. We
painted the town red that night. You could
paint Sydney red in the 'seventies. Times
have changed—and I don’t think you could
EXPLAINED.
INSURANCE MANAGER: “But considering the
number of years your husband insured
with us, didn’t you think it strange that
he should die immediately after increas-
ing the amount of his policy?”
WIDOW : “Oh, no. I just thought the poor-
boy had worked himself to death trying
to pay your premiums .”
do now’ the things w’e did in the next couple
of days and nights without being sent to
Long Bay prison—and no chance of being
merely fined. That w r as about the middle
of the week. By Sunday morning our first
transports of joy had calmed down a bit and
we w’ere sobered up. So we took it into
our heads to hire a turnout and drive
to Parramatta, to have a look at the old
school. By the same token it w r as Christ-
inas Day.
“We got to Parramatta a little after mid-
day, stabled our horses at the Woolpack,
and went for a stroll round the park before
dinner, which wms to be at 2 o’clock. Of
course, the school was deserted, being holiday
time. It had been shut up for five years,
until Mr. Macarthur came up from Mac-
quarie Fields and re-opened it the year be-
fore. But we had a good look at the grim
old building from across the river. And
talked over the couple of years w’e’d been
together—before the Michael brothers had
departed so suddenly. I asked Pie about
Pudding—how w’as he getting on?
“He grinned a bit sheepishly, and said :
“ ‘D’ye know, Yellow Belly, we ain’t
spoken from that day to this! George is a
pig-headed brute. He’d never admit ’twas
my egg landed on old Sauer Kraut first. You
know what the pater did to us—you heard
about that? Yes. Well, we kept on fighting
at intervals for months, until the Old Man
sent Pudding out on to a run he'd taken up
on the Lachlan side; and we’ve never spoken
from that day to this. The Old Man’s dead
now —we had another fight after the funeral
—and George’s got Mungabangalang, whilst
I’ve got Mitchell Plains, the Lachlan place.
I haven’t seen him since our last scrap, seven
or eight years ago. He’s an obstinate dog,
George is. Why can’t he give me credit?”
“ ‘Good Lord!’ I said. ‘Do you two dam’
fools mean to keep this sort of thing up for
the rest of your lives?’
“ ‘Well, it’s up to him,’ says Pie, in a sort
of grumble. ‘He knows dam well it was my
e °“We went back to the Woolpack, and
walked into the dining-room, where dinner
was waiting for us. The blinds were pulled
across the windows to darken the room and
keep the flies down, and when we first
sat down at the end of the long table we
were only able to recognise that there was
a big fellow seated opposite to us—couldn t
make him out very distinctly. But I’d hardly

got my napkin unfolded before Pie jumps on
to his feet, knocking his chair over and curs-
ing.
“I could see the stranger better by this
time—it was George Michael, grown into a
magnificent type of man, with a big yellow
beard! In a moment he was on his feet,
and had thrown his glass of wine in his
brother’s face.
“ ‘You lying young swine,’ he roars. ‘lt
toas my egg!’
“Well, now, it seems incredible, but I’d the
Devil’s own time with those two. And all
about a childish thing that had happened
thirteen years before. Nothing would do ’em
but they must go across to the playground,
and have it out in the old fighting place ‘be-
low the hill’—you know, the upper bank of
the river, above the dam. So I went with
’em, begging them to shake hands, and being
told to ‘shut up’ by both of ’em. . They would
fight. Nothing’d stop ’em. I’ll bet Dr.
Horn’s ghost—he’d been killed and eaten
in the Islands by this time—l’ll bet he was
chuckling.
“They’d stripped to the waist, and I saw
the marks of the lashing the Major ’d given
’em on their backs, when a brilliant idea
came to me. Pie had told me he was engaged
to be married, to a girl I knew. I thought
I’d make use of her.
“ ‘Pie. I said, solemnly, ‘if you scrap with
your brother I’ll tell Molly Kersage all about
it.’ .
“ ‘Oli. dammit, Yellow Belly, you wouhln t
do that?’ he says, looking a bit scared. She
was a genteel, lovable girl—long dead now.
“ ‘By Gad, I will!’ I says.
“I could see he was having a terrible
struggle—a sort of agony. At last he says,
shakily, to his brother:
“‘George, Avill you shake hands?’
“The big fellow hesitated. Then he came
forward with his bis: paw held out. But he
half withdrew it when he. came close up to
Pie.
“ ‘I suppose that was my egg, Harry?’ lie
says. He was laughing.
Pie glared at him for a moment or two
—and then he grinned. “Oh, I suppose it
was. This d —d Yellow Belly’s got me beat
—the cow! George,’ he says, ‘let’s chuck
him in the river for interfering in family
affairs that don’t concern him.’
“ ‘Right-o, Harry, old boy,’ says George,
as thev shook hands.
“And, by Gad, they did! And we had a
very happy Christmas together.”

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
FRANK PORTER, best loved of all
theatrical managers, told Whaley
of the newest “attraction” of his
linn, and told him with all the enthusiasm
that is Porter's for his latest job. Porter
has that reputation everywhere. If he is
managing a singer, then that singer is the
greatest that ever was, or is or will be.
If he gets a new feature movie, then that
is the greatest movie that was, is or shall
be, world without end.
So, knowing him as we all know Frank
Porter, Whaley, the red-bearded poet, smiled,
kindly but unbelieving. The “attraction”
did not sound very attractive to Whaley,
and Whaley said so.
Porter regarded him almost pityingly.
“Not attractive? Here’s twenty-two Ameri-
can niggers—big bucks like black panthers
—heads that are 50 per cent, mouth, each
mouth made of red velvet, and there’s not
been a nigger-minstrel show here for 25
years. Why, it would be tremendous—the
people would eat them. We’ll do enormous
business. Enormous! Twenty-two Rastuses
and Ephims and two Arab jugglers. They’ll
be interesting—they’ll be the rage. Twenty-
one big coons with twenty-one big mouths
like red plush cushions in a cellar at mid-
night, and twenty sets of eyeballs showing
white while they sing the chorus of ‘Do
not tear it, Mister Draper, Mother says
she’ll take the piece!’ Does human nature
change? It does not. If our fathers en-
joyed blackfaced minstrels when they could
not get the real coon show, why won't we
take the coons?”
“Human nature doesn’t change, but it
changes its fashions; and, taking it all
round, if fashions do recur they only do so
partially. We’d never go back to wigs, for
instance because the world is definitely
cleaner in its habits.”
“Doesn’t apply to shows, old man.’
“Yes, it does. Nobody will ever again
pay a man a big salary to sing ‘Jump, Jim
Crow.’ ” .
“Maybe not; but they'll pay a new Lottie
Collins £lOO a week again to sing as stupid
a thing as ‘Tarara-Boom-de-Ay,” because
they’ll pay it to a personality. My dear
Whaley, you don’t understand human nature
because you don’t understand the show busi-
ness. There was a charm to nig.-minstrels
once; therefore, at intervals, there must
always be. Big coons rolling the whites of
their eyes, and singing about a flower from
their angel mother’s grave, and four fat
nigs quartering in ‘Come Where Me Love
Lies Dreaming’—why, it will be tre-men-
dous. Up goes the curtain. Twenty-two
nigger boys sitting in a row in a lialf-moon,
and thev sing a chorus, and there’s two
bones and two tambos, and the first tambo
says: ‘Yahah, Mister Jolinsing, can you tell
me why a chicken cross ober de road?’ and
Jolinsing repeats the question so that the
fat-headed audience can get it, and says t ho
doesn’t know-; and the tambo. says ‘Wal,
Mister Jolinsing, de reason why de chicken
cross ober de road is because dat chicken
want to get de oder side,’ and the inter-
locutor laughs, and pretends lie’s such a born
idiot he couldn’t have thought of that. And
then he says: ‘Mr. Ulysses Iv. Peabody
will now sing the pathetic ballad “My Heart
Fondly Strays to the Old Trysting-place by
the Mill,” ' and the
bones and tambos.
tear into it. My
boy, it’s so old it’s
new. The men who
listened to it and
liked it once and
then tired of it are
dead, and a new
generation is here
just as foolish, just
as interested in
laughter and coons
and walking home
with its girl in the
starlight. It will
be all new again.
Who knows now
what an olio is?”
“Well, what is it
—floor polish or
salad-dressing?”
“It’s the collec-
tion of single turns
in the second part
of the show before
the black farce of
‘Boy Wanted.’ ”
“A murrain on
it?”
“I know; can’t
stand ’em myself,
but the crowd likes
’em. And, apart
from that, all the
other items are
funny or mock
heroic. I’ll get a
few such things
fixed for ’em. Like
‘Don’t Go to the
Fire, Daddy,’ or
the War or some
such thing.”
“Seems good,
motherly advice;
what's it like?”
“Just this: —
Don’t go to the fire, Daddy;
Firemen are killed who roam ;
Don’t go to the fire, Daddy,
But stay safe here at home;
Don’t go to the fire, Daddy,
The fireman’s daughter said.
And the fireman replies:—
I ain’t goin’ to no fire ;
I’m goin’ ’ome to bed.”
“Give ’em stuff like that and I’ll come in
whenever I’m bored,” said Whaley. “And
that’s once a month.”
“You’ve no idea of the show business. I
tell you these twenty-two coons, and Sheer
Ally and Rustum will get this town by the
braces. They’ll be here two months from
now.” •»
“And where are they now?”
“Open in Auckland Saturday week. Six
weeks over there, and then here. Our man
Endicott is with ’em, and their manager is
Stacpoole Dee —slick American chap, they
tell me. Wait for Bar sand’s Minstrels,
twenty-two big mouths made of red plush,
not to mention Sheer Aliy and Rustum.
A month later Whaley met Frank Porter
and asked him if he was not late with his
press - preliminaries—the little paragraphs
that hint at the great things in store.
“All off, all off, my boy.”
“What, arc the coons dead?”
“They are, dear boy—dead to us. Oh,
no, we never mention them, their name is
never heard. We found ’em out early and
cut the loss. They’re not Barsand’s Min-
strels, but a base imitation. Barsand—
the original, only-genuine Barsand —is with
the angels long years ago, and this gang of
black frauds has been invented to go with
the printing—which I must say is great, my
boy. No, we cut the loss.”
“A bad loss?”
“Very! Twenty-four fares from America
and Mr. Stacpoole Dee’s fare, too. And the
loss on four weeks of bad business in Auck-
land and the South. We had the option to
quit them in four weeks and it's happened.
Our man Endicott wired after the first night,
‘House hundred eighty-seven pounds—show
rotten.’ After the second night he wired,
‘House fourteen pounds,’ and we cabled ‘M hat
explanation?’ and he replied, 'People don t
like us and we deserve it.’ So we cancelled
on the four weeks and we’ve withdrawn
the £2400 bond we gave the Commonwealth
to let the coons come in.”
“Then unless somebody else guarantees
them they can’t come to Australia?”
“No, but the shipping company has issued
tickets to them all the way ’Frisco to Sydney,
so they’ll have to bring ’em on. And as they
can’t get ’em in without, a bond they’ll have
to carry them back to America. We’ve cut
our loss, and now we’ll forget it.”
But you can't forget two dozen
coons easily, and Stacpoole Dee gave
Australia a chance to remember them.
Whaley saw Stacpoole Dee first when
Porter pointed him out about a fortnight
after he had promised to forget the despised
minstrels of the alleged Barsand. Stacpoole
Dee is a man with the complexion known as
olive; but it doesn’t describe him, because
in him there is not enough green to displease
an Orange lodge. A fleshy, graceful man
of a clear, dark skin, blue-black hair and
bulbous brown-black eyes, black moustached,
chin clean shaven but suggesting that with
age the beard would grow strong and show
his shaven jaws comedian-blue ; a man of
40 or less, and something in his curly hair
a hint of miscegenation in South Carolina.
“I’m a great fool,” said Porter. “My
business was to have avoided this chap.
Embarrassing to know him, seeing that he
brought out a goose-show and we had to
throw it down. I simply shouldn’t have met
him. My private fortune-teller told me to
beware of a dark man, and there’s going to
be two of ’em.”
As he spoke Dee was joined by a typical
Jew of Assyria, ageing, but showing that
once he had been a man of force, all black
whiskers and brass. Before we could escape
Dee bore down on us with his Assyrian.
“ll’lo, Misterr Partah,” he said. “Meet
Misterr Flolim. Misterr Flohm has joined
me in the management of Barsand’s Min-
strels.??
Mister Flohm deprecated the statement.
“No, no, I ain’t,” he said. “ ’Scuse me. All
I'm doin’, Mr. Porter, is puttin’ up the bond
to let Mr. Dee’s artists come into the. Com-
monwealth, and I take an interest in the
READY-TO-WEAR.
THE MAN : “Vera wouldn’t conic because she didn’t have a fancy
dress.”
THE MAID: “How ridiculous! That last evening-gown of hers teas
a good enough comic for anything.”
show for findin’ the bond. No responsibility
—no responsibility.”
“Misterr Partah, Misterr Flohm has
joined me managerially. Glad to see you
and your friend at the theatre when we open.
And will you join us in a little drink?”
Yet with all the desire to beware, Frank
Porter attended the first night in Sydney
of Barsand’s alleged Minstrels in a theatre
that had the light and airy cheerfulness of a
morgue. He trapped Whaley, and Whaley
accompanied him for natural love and affec-
tion.
The. curtain rose on a funeral semi-circle
from Ethiopia, via South Carolina and the
Golden Gate, and Porter and Whaley saw
at a glance why Endicott had cabled that
they deserved the ill-will of the populace.

THE CHRISTMAS GIFT.


It was gloom relieved only by the twenty-four
red plush mouths, hoary jokes about Moses
ahd the bulrushes, and of a dog wearing more
dothes in summer than in winter because
in Winter he wears a coat and in summer
he wears ft boat and pants j and the old
worn-otit humor of bones and tambo, sound-
ing like conventional regrets at ft rich man’s
funeral. ,
Frank Porter moved in his chair as one
utterly weary and searching for a com-
fortable place to ease his hip-bone. He
returned to complete consciousness but
Once, and that was when a black gentle-
man with a mouth like a crimson carpet-
bag wide open roared something so full of
life that it was inescapable, and a chorus
from twenty-one similarly-large red carpet-
bags answered him: —
"Come, my love, and go with me.
Yas, my lub, I meet you,
Take you down to Tennessee,
Meet you by and bye.
Ole man he am gone to res’.
Yas, my love, I'll meet you,
Dress youself up in yo’ bes’
(Meet you by and bye).
Hoe de corn !
‘Hoe de corn ;
Hoe de corn, Moses,
Hoe de corn ;
Moses, hoe de corn.
Get away from dat winder,
Mah love an’ mah dove,
Get away from dat winder, don’t you heah!
Oh my!
Come anodder night,
Dere’s goin’ to be a fight,
For dem razors am a-flyin’ in de air.”
And they hoed the corn ad lib. Yet neither
Porter nor Whaley had too much of the jolly
foolishness. It encouraged them to sit the
show out; and all but “Hoe the corn” was
painful—even harrowing. Sheer Ally as a
juggler was as untrue to name as his mate
in crime, Rustum, was not.
Said Frank Porter to Whaley as they left
the show: “They’re gone a million. Monday
won’t take the rent. The show doesn’t hoe
enough corn.”
He was right as to Monday; the takings
were less than the rent, and Tuesday in the
second week was long remembered in the
Hotel Eastfalia as a day of excursions and
alarums. Stacpoole Dee lived at that cara-
vanserai, and the number and description of
his visitors made the hotel manager believe
that he had entertained a devil unawares.
Flohm, who had bonded himself for £IGO a
head, told Porter and Whaley his troubles,
being that kind of man who wears his
money-troubles on his sleeve for jokers to
laugh at.
“Where am I?” he asked Porter and the
poet. “Mr. Stacpoole Dee’s show falls down,
and he hadn’t anything like the capital he
told me he had; hasn’t any, that’s the fact.
Friday night he pays the stage-hands, front
of the house and the band; but the negro
gentlemen get only a few bob, what d’ye
think? An’ if he can’t pay ’em wages lie
can’t take ’em out of Horstralyah, an’ is it
me to pay fares to America on two-dozen
negro gentlemen, what d’ye think? I'm goin’
to see him now, and the two-dozen negro
gentlemen are cornin’ here as a deputation
on their grievances. An’ each negro gentle-
man has got a cigar-box under his arm, an’
what’s in that cigar-box but a razor—what
d’ye think?” He shuddered. “A sharp
razor in each cigar-box! Twenty-four of
’em—or twenty-two, because Sheer Ally and
Rustum is civilised gentlemen, and they
gone to their lawyers; but these negro
gentlemen believe in direct action, what
d’ye think? An’ they got right with ’em,
too, see, Mr. Porter. Mr. Stacpoole Dec says
only the best’s good enough for the best, and
lie’s the best. I see his luncheon tray go up
to-day—chicken, sparragrass and a bottle of
cold wine with a napkin round its waist —-
and them negro gentlemen in trouble. There
they are now ; I’ll go up an’ get in first.”
He left Porter and Whaley, and, disdain-
ing the elevator in his hurry, ran up the
stairs; and Porter and Whaley went out to
the vestibule, there to hear the hall attend-
NOT SINCERE ABOUT IT.
“That young Jones conies here much too often! I’ll have to put a stop to it.”
“But I discourage his visits, father.”
“Nonsense! I haven’t heard you sing to him yet!”
ant state that he had just cause and impedi-
ment against all Barsand’s Minstrels forming
a deputation to any guest.
They were impatient of delay, and were
the kind of guest that any host would speed
at parting —twenty-two large gentlemen as
black and shining as newly-polislied boots.
They did not walk, but padded almost
silently, like great black cats. And the hall-
attendant argued, sparring for time, until
Mr. Stacpoole Dee had been paged to find
whether the deputation from Ethiopia via
Tennessee was welcome.
A big glossy negro whose eyes anxiety had
made bloodshot was their principal. He
carried a very large cigar-box that promised
a very large razor, and he spoke, not with
indignation, but as one half-resigned to
mortal injury.
“Cunnel,” he said to the hall-man, “Mr.
Stacpoole Dee jest done got to see us. We
don’t have no chicken, we don’t have no
wattermellins ; and chicken and wattermellins
is in our con track. Jes’ you read that con-
track, heah.”
The hall-attendant refused to read or
recognise or even see the contract; and the
big negro decided to promote him further.
“That’s the contrack, Judge, an’ it ses we
negroes get chicken Toosdees, Thursdees,
Satdees an’ Sabbath days; an’ at that no-
’count ten’ment house we signed up at they
gives us stoo. Then we don’t get no wages.
There’s us negroes singin’ ‘Hoe de Corn,’ and
we never see no corn, an’ no wattermellins.
Dat dere ten’ment house don’t give no ice-
cream an’ no pie. That’s wha’ we want
Mister Stacpoole Dee fur. If we can’t get
iio wages, we can’t; but we gotta have
chicken and sweet corn an’ ice-cream. An’
we don’t get none.”
The page returned to say that Mr. Stac-
poole Dee was indisposed and could not see
the deputation of twenty-two, but could and
would receive three delegates, and there was
much and excited eloquence in their selec-
tion.
The big glossy nigger with the very blood-
shot eyes was elected, and a cadaverous and
gloomy African and a smaller and fatter min-
strel were elected to accompany him; and
during election and after it the other nine-
teen coons gave advice:
“Sliow'm you cigar-box, Rastus.”.. . . “Hoe
de corn an’ razzers in de air. You done tole
’m we ain’t got no corn, but dere am razzers
in de b0x”.... “Eph’m, you slioley tell 'm we
is done starved to def”.. . . “You tell ’m we
is dyin’ fur eats”. ... “Slioav ’m de razzers,
Pete; show ’m de razzers.”
Pete, the very glossy African, opened the
red plush carpet-bag that was his mouth and
rolled his bloodshot eyes, so satisfying the
eighteen that he had cast the razor for a
leading part. The three followed the page
to the elevator, and Frank Porter drew
Whaley to the elevator-shaft, saying, “We’ll
follow them next trip. I'd like to see how
that fire-eater acts in the presence of that
cold douche, Mr. Dee.”
“Think Dee will stop the negro conflagra-
tion, eh?”
“If I know the man he’s a hand-grenade.
He’s from the South, too, and lie doesn’t
know that a cheeky nigger isn’t still a slave.
Let’s go up.”
They heard the voice of Dee giving final
instructions to the page, and the voice of
Flohm protesting of his own business.
“Tell the nigs to wait till I get through
with Damascus, b0y.... 'Tain’t no use talk-
in’, Flohm. I paid you five hundred dahlers
to put up that bond for the coons, and you
gotta take some risk for the cash.”
The page delivered his message to the
delegates, and retired grinning.
“But it’s all risk. If you can’t pay ’em
wages how can y’ buy their tickets back
home, what d’ye think?”
“Jest you don’t do any thinkin’, Flohm.
You gotta take risks for five hundred dahlers
—and you sure took ’em. Now, no use
lioorayin’; you’re in like the rest of us.”
“I’ll throw over the bond. I’ll go to law.”
“Jest you do, Flohm —jest you do. You
go to law, and you’ll be able to nod to
lawyers an 1 buy ’em drinks for years after-
wards if you don’t do nothin’ else. Good-
bye, Flohm, but don’t run into my nig depu-
tation as you’re goin’ out. They’re short-
tempered coons, and they all got razzers in
their little boxes.”
Porter and Whaley saw the three dele-
gates look at one another as if their secret
were out; and their defiance seemed to melt
as Flohm made his despairing exit, and they
knew thereby that the time of their trial had
arrived.
“Come in, you coons,” shouted Dee; and
the three entered, apology expressed in every
servile line of them.
From the room we heard proceeding the
mumbled introductory speech of Pete, and
the deprecatory honking and coughing of
Rastus and Eph’m. Also we heard Mr. Dee
give them no consideration and take the
offensive.
“Wal, you poor black trash,” he said,
“what’s your trouble now? Whatcher
want? Diamonds in your toenails and bear’s-
grease for your hair —eh? Some pomade on
your mustash, do y’? Well, y’ got a great
chance, ain’t y’? Whatcher want? Spit it
out, Pete, you poor fish —spit it out.”
The big negro made an attempt to prove
that he was not beaten, but his faltering
voice denied him.
“We jus’ want tell y\ Mister Dee, that we
ain’t got no money. We”
“Ain’t got not no money, ain’t y’? Well,
why ain’t y’? Because I don’t give y’ none,
and that’s because I ain’t got none. What
next?”
“Mistah Dee, we don’t get no ice-cream at
the baivdin’-house, an’ avc don’t get no wat-
termellins an’ no chicken, an’ it’s in the con-
track, and we don’t get no sweet corn.”
SWEET, FAMILIAR FACES
“Who was that fellow who bowed to you, as ice came in?"
“I can’t, place him, dearest—unless he was a co-re. in one of my early divorce cases.”
“Why, don’t I let y’ sing about ‘Hoein’ de
Corn, Moses,’ every night and mata-neese?
Don't I, y’ great big black stiff? If y’ want
corn, hoe it. An’ you all got razzers in the
cigar-boxes, have y'? Don't say y’ haven’t. ’
“We done got none, Mistah Dee.”
“You great big black liar, I know you got
’em. An’ eighteen more down stairs. Why,
y’ ”
There followed such a string of American
vaudeville insult that the delegates could be
heard gasping, as Dee continued: “Came
here to use razzers on me, did y’? I’ll give
y’ lead-poisonin’ if y’ say y’ did. Did ya?
If y’ didn’t, what d’ya come for?”
“No, sah; no, sah,” replied the nerve-
broken Pete. “We done jus’ come to ask —
to ask when de next rehearsal.”
“Ain’t none. Ain’t goin’ t’ be none. You
belong to Mistah Flolim. You see him. An’
now beat it, d’ya hear me? Don’t stay on
earth after to-morrer mornin’. Beat it!”
They beat it. The delegation emptied
itself into the corridor and wrfnt away as
near to the floor as whipped dachshunds.
“He’s a tough, but he knows how to do
things,” said Whaley as the delegation dis-
appeared to the elevator. “I’d like to see
him again.”
“We’re going to now”; and Porter knocked
upon the door.
“Come in,” said the voice of the negro-
tamer, and they entered. He was certainly
doing himself well. Such of the things con-
noted by the broken contact of the minstrels
were his —wine and ice and a canteloupe
melon and fat cigars.
“Howdy?” he said. “Hope my drink’s
yours.”
They said it was, and he served them from
such a bottle as had excited the envy of
Flolim —a big gold-topped bottle with a
napkin round its waist. Dee himself was
Solomon in all his glory—with such gay
socks as make the shoeless cry “Revolu-
tion !”
“Have a stogie,” said Dee, indicating the
box. “That’s a good smoke; a cigar like
that makes me a philosopher. At night, when
this bum show draws about the money for
the band, I put one of these fat smokes in
my face and I feel so prosperous I believe
we’ve got fifteen hundred dahlers in the
house.”
“So it’s a blue duck, eh:”
“Yas. You were wise guys to throw this
show down in Noo Zeal’n’. I knew the show
was bum, but I couldn’t let go for fear
I’d be electrocuted.”
“And what are you going to do about it?
“Oh, termorrer or nex’ week I’ll borrow
a million from this here Commonwealth
Bank. State bank, isn’t it? Well, it won't
do the stockholders much harm if they
lose out, because there ain’t no stockholders.
What’s a million to Congress? I’ll just give
poor old Damascus half a million to buy
bonds for all Africa; an’ the other half mil-
lion I’ll spend in chicken an’ ice-cream an’
sweet corn for Moses to hoe till June comes
nex’ Febrooary. I’ll tell Flohm to come
Monday for his.”
Neither Porter nor Whaley saw Stacpoole
Dee again; but they met Flohm a month
later and he told them what they already
suspected, which was that Dee’s talk of a
million merely signified that they should see
his face no more. “He got away on the
Sonora the day after he promised me,” said
Flohm. “Well, not acksherly promised, but
in that half-jokin’ way of his —talkin’ mil-
lions an’ drinkin’ wine, and payin’ in pea-
nuts. Yes, he got away.”
“And the twenty-four dark gentlemen?”
Flolim groaned at the memory. “I had
to ship ’em. It cost me six hundred an’
thirty pounds. And I only got a hundred
and no interest.”
“Only six hundred and thirty? Why,
there were twenty-four of them.”
“Yes, but Sheer Ally and Rustum got a
job for six months and the bond transferred
for them. _ That left twenty-tAvo, and one
died. I wish they’d all died, an all their
ancestors before they was born. I tell you,
Mr. Porter, the next man tries to draw
me into a wicked business like theatricals
I’ll be fined for playin’ pitch an’ toss with
him.”

Ecstasy.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
INTO the wood's green sanctuary
From his cell in the abbey grey,
In the mystical, beautiful month of Mary,
A monk came forth one day.
A holy book for his need he carried
Into the greenwood shade,
But his heart was filled with the peace that
tarried
There in the beechen glade.
Praise he offered, and meet thanksgiving,
But lo! at Heaven’s sill
A lark sang loud for the joy of living,
Over the heathy hill.
A lark sang loud at the gates of Heaven,
And the heart of him was there.
Who lived by faith and the holy leaven
Of sacrifice and prayer.
A lark sang loud at the gates of Heaven,
And in that summer wood
He grew aware of angels seven
Around him as lie stood.
He heard his name: the angels seven
Lifted their splendid eyes,
And lo! our Blessed Lady of Heaven
Looked down from Paradise.
She beckoned, and Space was straightway
riven
And the things of earth grew dim,
And he heard with the joy of a soul new-
shriven,
The song of the Seraphim.
And as he listened the brown lark’s singing
Failed like a dream remote,
And he woke with the earth sense round him
clinging
And the wind’s breath in his throat.
The song was done and the vision faded
Into the empty air,
Almost his spirit was persuaded
He dreamed that it was there.
Back to the abbey gates he hied him,
But his own familiar place
Entry and brotherhood denied him,
And no one knew his face.
A stranger stood by the portals hoary,
And hard at a stranger gazed,
Who stood without in the noontide glory,
Troubled and sore amazed.
Old books were brought, with the dust of
ages
Heavy on back and hasp,
And the good monks pondered the musty
pages
Held by each brazen clasp.
At last they read of a monk unwary,
One of their brotherhood.
Who had wandered forth in the month of
Mary
Into the wide greenwood;
And never again his place might hold him
(The stranger was filled with fears)
Who was lost in the woods, so the good
monks told him,
More than a hundred years.
A hundred years while their bells were
ringing
For Matin and Vesper-tide,
Time stopped to list to a brown lark singing
Over the green hillside.

The Brigadier.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
ALL day and all night a feverish sort
of life had been stirring in the ram-
shackle hotel, and sleep was banished
ovar the far horizon. Not that anyone but
myself seemed to want it very much. There
was a restlessness in the dry, hot air that
wandered in from the spinifex, smelling of
dust and goats, and even in the early hours
before dawn the thin partitions vibrated with
the sound of men arguing in their rooms over
poker or blundering about the passages in
their socks. A nightmare of clinking glasses
and chairs being knocked over. In an
obscure way the centre of it seemed to be
someone called the Brigadier. He was no-
where evident, but his name was on every-
one’s tongue, and his luck was continually
being drunk with all the customary sounds
of enthusiasm.
Sitting at the top of the back steps in the
early dawn, watching the sun rise spent and
sickly from behind the bare spinifex hills,
I could not help wondering how to put in
the twenty-four hours that remained before
the weekly train left. The resources of the
township, with its half-dozen tin houses
standing naked anil unashamed in the dust,
could be exhausted with the glance of an
eye. There was the abandoned derrick of
a copper-show on the skyline; a, row of bat-
tered trucks filled with ore on a siding; a
herd of goats browsing on jamtins across
the road. Only in the hotel-yard and in the
neighborhood of the kitchen were there signs
of life. Before a roaring fire that threat-
ened to expand at any moment and lick up
the flimsy structure around it. a stout, sun-
tanned woman with her skirt kilted up be-
hind her was preparing breakfast with a
great clatter of energy. Fowls rooted in
the dust beneath the pepper-tree. From the
outhouses a few sleepless men w’andered in J
vaguely, stopping to stare at the large plain-
turkey that was hanging up by the tank, or
to exchange badinage with the good-looking
half-caste girl who was carrying plates over
to the dining-room.
Breakfast! But who wanted to eat any-
thing just then except pickled gherkins?
-Hong the balcony a tall man came saunter-
ing with a slow, springy step and stopped
to gaze at the tawny, remote hills that were
holding the heat like a cup. He was
dressed in spotless white holland, and his
lithe body radiated a peculiar kind of euergv
as it he had just emerged from a cold shower.
A veil Ins bristling red beard had a challenge
in it, and when lie fixed his blue eyes on me
they seemed to penetrate be-
neath the skin.
"They're just as mad over
the road.” he began.
It didn't seem a particu-
larly sensible opening. Over
the road was nothing but the
herd of goats, feeding on gib-
bers and jam-tins.
“And as drunk as blue devils next door.”
he continued.
A little man with a grizzled moustache
ciune out of one of the bedrooms, scrubbing
his face with a towel.
( Come on, Brigadier,” he said amiably.
'We’re going to have breakfast. Curried
turkey with mango chutney made by old
Mother Purdie herself. You ought to be
working up an appetite now.”
He looked at me as if trying to enlist my
help in some long and arduous struggle. He
was the sort of little man who spends most
of his life easing the harness on galled
horses and helping lame dogs through the
barbed ivire. We went down to the dining-
room, which was fly-proof and tolerably cool,
though a hot wind was rising and the air
was full of a fine dust that gritted in the
teeth. But the Brigadier wouldn’t eat. He
sat stirring his coffee and repeating with a
whimsical seriousness his absurd statements
about the people over the road and next
door. It seemed as if some sort of rhythm
had got into his blood.
“I’ve taken my solemn davy to get him
away this time,” confessed the little man
afterwards. "Poor old Brig.! He's been
here for two months now, and they're round
him like flies. Good sorts, most of them,
but a man can have too many friends ! That
old harpy in the kitchen there —she lias a
clean suit and a white shirt ironed for him
every day, and clucks round him like a lien,
birt she has her hooks in him all the same.
You re going on the train in the morning,
aren t you? Perhaps you’d help to get him
aboard.”
I could not help asking whether the Bri-
gadier really wanted to go.
“Does a man know what he wants when
lies like the Brigadier is now?” he snorted.
"He’s sitting on ten thousand since he got
rid of his cobalt show, and he can’t spend
that here. Not except by pouring it down
other fellows’ necks. I’ve tried to get him
away every week for the last month, but
lie s always slipped me. There’s something
lie funks down there—a woman most likely.”
Just then an assayer from one of the
mines out in the spinifex strolled up. “The
Brig.’s going this time all right, Mac,” he
said. “He’s sorting out his traps on the
balcony, and lie’s given orders for the taps
to run free all day.”.
But the little man seemed to suspect a
snake in the woodpile. “Anyway, I'll stick
to him till I see him aboard,” he said
doggedly. “I don’t want to put in another
week in this blasted hole.”
He was down at the station next morning
with the Brigadier's bag and ticket, the one
perfectly sober man in all the company. It
had been a wild night, and no one had had
much sleep. . Until the early hours of the
morning dusty motor-lorries and dustier
horsemen had been lumbering in from the
aim landscape, and there had been argu-
ments about the Brigadier under the pepper-
tree in the yard. Some said that he was
going to buy a pub in Bethania ; others that
he was off on another prospecting trip into
the dry country along the Hall River when
he had done his little dash in town. In
spite of the way they revolved about him
they seemed to know very little of his
plans.
1 “Good-bye, boys!" lie called from the win-
dow, the sun blazing on his bald head and
red beard. “They’re just as mad over the
load.”
"And as drunk as blue devils next door!”
came the response.
It was his last attempt at jocularity. When
the train crawled out lie went and lay down
• on the seat, his blue eyes fixed on the roof
of the carriage and his big body seeming
shrivelled a little in its loose white suit. He
had come away without his hat —the devoted
Mac had not been able to attend to every-
thing. With sober forethought, though, he
had provided a couple of bottles of whisky,
which lie had stowed under the cushions of
the carriage. “He won’t want much,” lie
had explained. “The Brig.’s not a drinking
man, really, and he’s been sobering up for
the last few days. There'll be plenty of his
friends on the train, though.”
There were. When we changed at Beth-
ania and found berths on the overland mail
to the coast, everyone seemed to know the
Brigadier, from the conductor to the sheep-
men who were going home from the local
races. They crowded into his compartment
and broached the whisky, rallying the Briga-
dier about the way he would pull things to
DIAGNOSED.
PASSING FRIEND : “Hullo, old fruit —drunk
again. ?”
INEBRIATED ONE : “Oh, that’s it, ish it —
I knew there was something the matter
with me!”
pieces when he reached the coast. But none
of their jokes seemed to penetrate the veil
of aloofness that had suddenly gathered
around him. Sometimes he lay back with
his eyes closed ; at other times he sat examin-
ing his diary with a fixed scrutiny, but not
as if he saw anything that was written down.
Once in the middle of an argument he dis-
appeared, and the conductor found him stand-
ing out on the platform, with his hands in
his pockets, staring at the spinifex hills that
were slowly flattening out into broad plains
of crinkly Mitchell grass.
“Poor devil!” he said. “No wonder lie’s
a bit off his rocker. He did an all-out perish
back there in the dry belt.”
“Lost his mate, too,” said an old pros-
pector. “Young Jack Donovan from the
Towers, wvsn’t it? Good stamp of a lad,
they say, and a good bushman as well. They
were coming in from their cobalt show when
their horses cleared out and left them up
against it.”
“lf I’d cleaned
up what he did
from that show,”
chimed in another,
“I’d have got away
months ago. But
you never know
what’s at the back
of a man’s mind.
There may be a
woman he doesn’t
want to face—
there generally is.
The boy’s mother
in this case, most
likely.”
From their scat-
tered talk it was
possible‘to piece to-
gether most of the
Brigadier’s story.
For the last couple
of years Donovan
and he had been
prospecting in the
dry country, backed
by an Afghan store-
keeper who was
content to keep
them in supplies and
wait for a cut of
auyt h in g they
struck. They had
had some little luck
with mica, and at
last had come on a
rich vein of cobalt,
but flushed by their
success they had
stayed out too long
at a time when a
bad spell had struck
the spinifex and
the soaks were
drying up. On
the homeward trip
they found hardly a
couple of quarts
in a particular
hole they were depending on, and in the
night all their horses got away except one;.
It was a case of one of them having to make
a quick trip south to a mica camp where
there was a chance of getting horses or a
motor-lorry. The worst happened. On that
desperate dash across country, heat or thirst
got the better of the Brigadier, and when they
found him he was wandering about in the
ridges without his clothes.
“And it was close on a fortnight before
he could give a straight account of it all, or
tell them where Donovan was,” said one of
the sheepmen. “Poor old Brig. ! All that
time lie was dead to the world. And of course
the little black ants found Donovan before
anyone else did.”
It was not a cheerful story. Now that the
gist of it was clear, it was easy' to under-
stand why the men back at the ramshackle
hotel had talked more about the Brigadier’s
future than his past. Even little Mac hadn’t
been communicative; he had concentrated on
the business of getting the Brigadier away.
When they had all gone to sleep in the
heat of the day, the Brigadier came back to
the compartment and poured out a nip of
whisky. He had been playing cards, at the
back of the train with a crowd of shearers
who had just got on, and seemed glad of
the chance to mix with men who knew no-
thing about him. But he looked suspiciously
at the cigar-stumps on the door, and his keen,
sensitive face took on a militant expression.
“They’ve been talking about me,” lie said.
“Nothing much,” I told him.
“Well, that’s the bulk of what they know,”
lie said swiftly. “Don’t believe all you
hear.”
He was sober as an owl now. and ready
to talk, but not about himself. The train
was droning on through the great stretches
of Mitchell grass, where a fly-speck on the
horizon five miles away stood for a boundary-
rider poking round his fences, and a
faint haze created a mirage of shin-
ing lakes with talk trees and drooping
willows on their banks. The Briga-
dier was anxious to point out places
where he had camped when lie had
first come west. But lie wouldn’t sit
still for long. He prowled about the
empty compartment with his light,
tigerish step or stood at the window
in the corridor with his hands in his
pockets.
“They’re just as mad over the road,
Brig.,” said the conductor coming-
through.
But the rhythm had worked itself
out of the Brigadier’s blood, and lie
didn’t respond.
Most of the sheepmen , had left, the
train now, and it was nearly empty.
Dusk fell over the plain, and even the
scattered clumps of myall seemed to
gather atmosphere ami mystery into
their depths. The lights of little town-
ships winked for a few moments and
were gone.
“Did those fellows tell you that young
.Jack and I had a row that last morning?”
said the Brigadier, coining in from where
he had been brooding in the dark. He spoke
as if his story was a thing that was flowing-
round him.
“No ; nothing of the kind,” I protested.
“Well, it’s true,” he said casually. “There
wasn’t anything else to tell that mattered
much.”
He sat down near the window and took
out a wallet that was stuffed with notes and
soiled papers. There was a girl, he
admitted; she was the only one who had ever
turned his head for more than a few weeks
at a time. “And she could do anything she
liked with me,” he said. “Now, or at any
other time. We'd arranged that if I struck
anything good—no, we hadn’t arranged : we'd
taken it for granted. Her old man had lost
money at mining and didn’t like the smell
of it, so he tried to keep the door locked
when I was around. But he was a flabby
old devil, anyhow, sunk deep in underwear
and hosiery, and he didn’t count. I reda
would have come with me three years ago
if I’d given her the word —slung over every-
thing and chanced her luck among the spini-
fex. That’s what she told me, anyway.
When I took young Jack to see her a few
weeks before we left”
WOULD HAVE LIKED TO BITE IT.
PORIER (to passenger who has just missed the train): “Were you
wanting to catch that train, sir?”
PASSENGER : "Oh. no. I didn’t like the look of it, so I just chased
it out of the station .”
He wasn’t very coherent about it all. The
conductor came to the door of the compart-
ment while we were talking, and he stiffened
into immobility again. When we were finally
left together and making ready for bed, his
mind was back at the soak.
"We had a row that last morning,” he
said in an abstracted voice, "the first row
we ever had. Every man shows the cracks
in his mind some time or other. That was
my turn. And when young Jack talked of
leaving me there while he tried to follow the
horse’s tracks down the creek-bed—well, I’d
known for months Freda had been writing
to him under cover of old Abdul, and it all
came out with a rush. Things 1 didn’t know
I’d been thinking. And he sat there quiet,
young Jack, never saying a word except to
persuade me to go. Yes, I let him persuade
me in the end. When I looked back from
a quarter of a mile away he was sitting by
the soak, trying to mend the springs of a
broken watch.”
He crawled into his upper bunk and lay
stretched out with his eyes on the ceiling,
stiff as a gun-barrel, He’d been fingering a
photograph he had in his wallet, but he
didn’t show it to me. It was easy ho
imagine that face in the dusk, though—a
dark, oval face, probably, with eyes that had
a spice of devil in them. Easy, too, to
image how it had haunted those two back
there in the spinifex when they saw the end
looming ahead.
"Young Jack had the light end of the log,
after all,” said the Brigadier, after a long
silence. I’ve still got to face her and tell
her how it came about. . .. Denman-street.
Second house on the left. Curved gravel
path from the gate.”
Ihe conductor had arranged to wake him
early, for he was getting off: at the Towers.
\\ hen the dawn came the train was on the
hilly country above Townsville, bucketing
down steep grades to the coast, and he had
gone from the bunk above.
It was only a month later, when I drifted
down from further north, that I heard any-
thing more about him. Eoungiug on the river
front one Sunday afternoon, watching the
launches setting out for Magnetic Island,
with their crowds of young men and girls.
I noticed a grizzled old chap in dusty serge
standing by the ticket-office and feeling in
his pockets for change. So unexpected was
the encounter that for a few moments I
didn’t recognise little Mac.
“I’ve been down over a week,” he told me,
as lie waited at the entrance. “Fooling round
most of the time, finding it hard to put the
days in. It was the Brigadier’s affairs
brought me down. I’d got a draft put
through for him on a bank here, and fixed
up some other things at a time when he
couldn t keep his end up. You've heard all
about: the poor old Brig.?”

The Gutty Sark:
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
T ’VE sailed the sea as man and boy
1 For more than sixty year;
As boy and man I’ve sailed the sea
In every kind of craft there be;
On full-rigged ship and Margit Hoy
I learned to reef and steer.
I’ve dodged the icebergS i round the Horn
And tossed on Biscay’s bay ;
I’ve anchored in the Bay of Whales
With splintered spars and patchwork sails ;
I’ve worked the pumps from night till morn
And through the live-long day.
There ain’t lib kind of craft as floats
As t hin’t helped to drive,
I’ve even sailed a Shanghai jltnk,
With Captain dead and crew dead-drunk,
And fifed On trans-Atlantic boats
A-steamiii’ twenty-five,
in ships and barques and brigantines’
And fore-an’-afters, too,
I’ve sailed in gales and wild typhoons
That played the Devil’s damndest toons
In Black-balls, Anderson’s and Green's,
And floatin’ hells a few !
As boy and man I’ve used them all,
From deck-swab to A. 8..;
But there’s a dainty ship I know,
The best to ride, the best to go,
The best, from keel to top-mast tall,
That ever put to sea!
Her figure-head’s all shinin’ gold—
By Hellyer of Blackwall—
And, oh, but she’s a bonny ship
From monkey-poop to jib-boom tip
As ever down her eastin’ rolled—
The bravest of them all!
She’s still afloat and still as sound
As in her maiden days,
As safe and sound as Noah's ark.
Her name? The rare old Cutty Sark,
The fastest ship the whole world round
That ever left the ways.
I joined her as lop-lollyboy
When Moodie was Old Man.
Jock Willis had her decked with teak,
For which we blessed him, so to speak—
No blarsted holy-stonin’ joy
To keep her spick and span!
Her bright-work flared to blind your eye,
As ns lop-lollies knew.
She’d barrel-winches on her rail
For sheets and tacks when trimmiu’ sail
Aiid—s’elp me if I tell a lie! —-
Bail-bearin’ sheafblocks, too!
In ’seventy we sailed away,
Bound for the China Seas,
The Golden Shimmie at the fore—
The same as Burns’s Nannie wore—•
The smartest clipper of the day,
Before a spanking breeze.
I Was With Moodie when he thrashed
The Cutty round the Cape
And chased the famed Thermopylae—
With jury-rudder rigged at sea
And tops'ls gone and bulwarks smashed—
And licked her out of sight.
Bob Willis, brother of young Jock,
. Cried “Make the nearest land!”
Blit Moodie says, “You’ll sail with me
Or go to Hell alone!” says he.
“The Cutty’s bound for London Dock
With all the sail she’ll stand!”
We raced the flying Hallowe’en,
Tiie bold Blackadder, too;
The Plimsoll and the York outsailed;
The Cutty never Woodget failed —
No better seaman e’er was seen
’Twixt London an’ the ’Loo!
One day when I was standin’ trick
We shipped some mountain seas;
They caught the port-watch unawares
An’ made ’em start to say their prayers.
“I’ll make you beggars pray!” says Dick;
“Down on your shaking knees!”
And once, off Gabo, in the night,
AVe chased the P. and O.
Britannia, flamin’ like a stove,
And beat her into Sydney Cove,
With all our lads with all their might
A-yellin’ “Blow, Boys, Blow!”
And now she lies in Carrick Roads,
The old flag at the fore!
No longer will the Portugee
Upon her decks be makin’ free,
A-dressin’ her in furrin modes
In things she never wore.
There’s something in my heart as says
I haven’t dreamt in vain
Some mornin’, when you’re in your beds,
The Cutty’ll sail through Sydney Heads;
And in a golden sunrise blaze
I’ll see her once again.
And when old Bo’sn Death pipes down
And comes my watch below,
I’ll ask her for a passage free —
A deep plunge in the clean blue sea—
With Davey Jones to find my crown,
As old salts used to go!

[FOR THE BULLETHIN.]
RIGHT up to the last moment of his
consulting hours Adrian Nicholas,
M. 8., waited in the hope that some
stray patient might add one more half-
guinea to his year’s income. It was Christ-
mas Eve, and next day he was to leave for
the Snowy River —his first holiday since de-
mobilisation. It had been a gruelling strug-
gle, picking up the threads of normal life
again and digging himself into a suburban
practice. But it had been worth while.
He had a sense of security at last —the books
disclosed a thousand pounds- net for his
second year. lie would have a practice to
sell directly; and then Macquarie-street,
specialising in nervous and mental disorders.

children into the world; no more tedious

cases, extraordinary fevef'salk of character
under the strain of war. The nerves ana tliC
brain were the motors of sentient life, and he
wanted to concentrate on their study and
treatment. His only ambition was to become
a great alienist. Four years in field-hospitals
patching up mangled Diggers and Tommies
had convinced him that sanity, after all,
is only a relative term- —that amongst the
twenty millions of combatants floundering in
the mud and filth of “scientific” war, all
that could be said was that some mortals
are madder than others.
His reverie drifted to war Christmases. To
one in particular, when despair had grasped
him so completely that he nearly went under,
with thousands of others who persisted in
trying to think as well as do the work in
hand,
His musings were interrupted by the sound
of a bell ringing and the ushering in of the
stray patient lie had waited for. It was a
woman, Well dressed, heavily Veiled-, and evi-
dently net’vous ana .excited. $6 waited a
few moments beforC beginning Ilfs customary
questions. She inquired at last whether it
w r as necessary to reveal her identity, and
would what she had to say be repeated out-
side the room?
“I am not concerned with your identity,
but your bodily ailments,” was the brusque
retort. “And you should have been satisfied
on your second question before coming here.”
She raised her veil as she answered. “I
know, I know” she stammered. “I didn’t
mean that I distrusted you. But I have not
come to you for medical advice. I am in
great trouble and want help—the help of a
man who was at the war and will under-
stand.”
Fie gazed at her curiously for a moment
before replying. There was nothing to dis-
tinguish her from the average run of “good-
looking” women, but he felt sure that he
had seen her before somewhere.
“It depends on what your trouble is and
whether I am the right man to help you,”
he said; then indicating a well-ringed finger,
“I see that you are married. Why not your
husband?”
“He was not at the war. He would never
understand.”
“Why did you come to me?”
“Only because I saw that you displayed
a ‘returned’ medal. You attended a maid
HONEYMOON HUNGER.
HE: “Waiter —bill, please!”
WAITER: “But you haven't had anything yet, sir!”
at my house last week. I noticed the medal
and thought you looked dependable. I—l—
had this letter thrust into my hand by an
unknown man yesterday.”
He read the letter :
I know of your visit to the old Inn at Y on
Christmas Eve of 1917. One of my most treasured
war trophies is the handbag you 16st, with its
letters, the passionate appeals of Colonel C and
other proofs of that week-end in rural England.
These trophies are for sale to the highest bidder.
I make no apologies. A man must provide for
proper celebration of the birth of Christ. Don’t come
to the undermentioned address without a substantial
sum. Nothing under five hundred. As much over
as your generosity may prompt.
The address was in a locality known to be
mainly occupied by Sydney’s underworld.
“I am not a detective,” said the doctor.
“Take my advice and hand this over to the
police.” = TI
“I dare not,” she replied. What lie says
is true.”
“And your husband does not know:
“He must never know. The moment he
does I will kill myself. I have the money
he demands. Will you see him? If I go
he will only play with me. I shall be a
victim of blackmail as long as he lives. But
you—one who was over there —will know
how to get everything, and silence him.”
She saw that he hesitated and poured out
the whole of her story. She had gone to
the Front as a nurse —a girl just past twenty.
For three years she had, worked in hospitals,
always near the Front, often in danger zones,
and the fever of irresponsibility which in-
fected all types of men and women during
the war had caught her. She yielded to the
importunities of an English officer —she knew
he was married. Throwing off all restraints
they had spent a leave together, part of it
in Paris, part in the village in Sussex men-
tioned in the letter. She never saw him
again. He was killed a week after his
return to the Front. It wasn’t that she had
loved him —the war had taken the fineness out
of her, had left her besmirched. She had
plunged into work again, trying to forget.
Then came her return to Australia and
love, real love, and marriage. Her hus-
band worshipped her, but he was hard and
intolerant.
“He would never understand! she cried.
“Only those who have been there could
understand !”
“I think you had better let me see your
husband. I can make him understand.”
“No ! No !” she insisted. “He would never
have married me if lie had known. He will
leave me if lie knows now.”
“This blackmailer was one of us. Why
not tty to make him understand?”
. “ft tvffuld be useless. The war blotted out
the souls .Of some men, and some women.
He must be one Of those, ~ ,to write such
a letter....on Christmas Eve, I thought
I had walled off those four awful years, but
he has broken down the wall and Blade
me cheap and common again. Only a man
like you can help me.”
He had been examining the letter again.
“The writer of this is a dope fiend,” he
replied. “There is a faint odor which can
never be mistaken.” She shuddered as he
continued: “And you can’t reason with a
dipsomaniac or a drug man. I’ll get a detec-
tive from police headquarters to handle the
matter privately.”
She pleaded with him, at least to see the
man once, and he finally yielded, but refused
to offer money.
“If there’s a spot of manhood in him I’ll
stir it,” he said; “but I won’t be an ordinary
intermediary between a blackmailer and his
victim.”

. Two hours. later Dr. Adrian Nicholas
fduiid himself iii . a locality quite different
from thq tVbii-fii'defed. suburb in which he
practised: Ntyt fay beliind he
was in a network .of iidtrOw streets and
lanes, and was surprised fo’ find that Sydney,
in one respect, was a miniatuf'e London—
that just behind the glitter of well-lighted
and crowded shopping streets, dark little'
alleyways, with the furtive coming and go-
ing of evil-looking people, could be found.
He traced the address on the letter with
some difficulty—an old, terraced two-storey
house at the end of a blind lane.
A blowsy woman disputed his right to
enter the house, on the ground that her
lodger never allowed anyone in his room.
An altercation at that stage was out of the
question, so, thrusting some money into her
hand, he said: “I am his brother. Leave
us together for half an hour, and I’ll double
that.”
He climbed the rickety staircase, and,
after transferring a revolver from a hip to
a coat pocket, quietly opened the only door
on the landing.
The room was indescribably untidy, a
litter of broken furniture, clothes, books,
newspapers and cigarette butts. Lying on
a bed was the form of a man. Turning to
its full the only gas-jet which lighted the
room, the doctor quickly surveyed his sur-
roundings. The man was asleep, with an
open book beside him —a well-bound volume
of Casanova. On a shelf above the bed
many books were arrayed—a rather appall-
ing pornographic library. The walls were
plastered with cheap prints of nudes.
The visitor made a quick estimate of the
type of man he had to deal with, and, cross-
ing to the bed, turned the sleeper's face to
the light and roughly roused him. The face
into which he gazed was that of a young
man grown old, terribly old, with dissipa-
tion. The skin, almost yellow, sagged un-
pleasantly beneath the eyes and chin.
The eyes opened, and for fully a minute
gazed uncomprehendingly at the erect and
menacing figure at the bedside. Suddenly
there were signs of recognition. The black-
mailer struggled to a sitting posture, and
extending a hand to his visitor, said: “By
all that’s holy, if it isn’t old Adrian! Where
the hell did you spring from?”
“Ralph Marston!” was the reply. “I
thought you went west in 1018!”
“Not I! Came out of a German concentra-
tion camp just after the Armistice. Stayed
on the other side till last month, and. left,
rather hurriedly, and here I am—-what there
is of me.”
“Drugs?” asked Nicholas.
“When I can get them. But this damned
country is worse than England. An occa-
sional hour in heaven, when you can buy it,
costs a fortune.”
“Do you remember Christmas Eve of
1917? Just behind Bapaume?”
“No, I don’t,” was the snarling reply,
“and I don’t want to. Any fool who reminds
me of the war is not wanted here. What
I’m worrying about is the present. I’m
down to my last sixpence. But,” fumbling
with a cigarette, “not for long. I’m on a
good wicket here. Found a little gold-mine
which will return regular dividends. First
divvy may come to-night.”
“I’m glad,” was the «uiet response. “You
can do with a bit of luck.”
“Luck! It isn’t luck,” was the chuckling
reply; “it’s a touch of genius. Knowing the
value of things and when to sell them. I’pi
a trader on a large scale, Nick, and my
richest customer will be here to-night.”
“And if he doesn’t turn up?”
“Then I’ll go to her —not him. To-morrow
somebody must provide Merry Christmas for
me. The last two were hell!”
“What about a fortnight in the open with
me? The Snowy River trout are biting and
I’m in funds.”
“Not for me. I can’t live in open places
now. They frighten me.”
“I can get the dope out of you, Ralph.”
“How did you find me?”
“Saw you in town and got a policeman to
follow you and report.”
“Damn your impudence! The last people
I want to know are the police. Now I’ll
have to move.”
“Right down to it, Ralph?”
“What do you mean by down?”
"No desire for a fresh start? I got mine;,
old man, and it was worth while.”
“Now look here, Nick, I’m not looking:
for sympathy, or advice, or uplift. A few
pounds from an old pal now and again would
be acceptable. But, apart from that, leave:
me alone. I don’t want a crowd of busy-
bodies rushing about trying to save me.”
“The dope got me for a few months,
Ralph, but I’ve nearly mastered it.”
“Nearly? So have I, nearly, a dozen
times, but I threw in the towel two years
ago.” Suddenly his whole manner changed.
“Any chance of a ‘shot’ /” he asked cring-
ingly. “I’d sell my gold-mine for a week’s
supply.”
“I always carry a tabloid,” said the doc-
tor, “but only one. This one has been irt-
my pocket for live days. The next one may
be for six or seven. In six months I’ll stop
carrying them.”
“Damn the tabloids!” muttered Ralph.
“They’re too slow. Why don’t you carry it
needle?”
"I’ll tell you what,” was the reply. “I’ll:
chiiie back later with a full supply, and
we’ll dre'atn pur way through Christmas Day-
together. I’ifl . due, for one more big slide,
before cutting it put/’
As he rose to leave he placed a white
tabloid on the table. “That will keep yon
going till I return,” he said,
"You will come back, old man,” Ralph
pleaded. “With the stuff. I haven’t had a
fair run for weeks.”
“What about your visitor?” asked Nicho-
las. “Can I send word anywhere, postponing
her visit?”
“No, you can’t. If she turns up, it will
be before you come back. If she doesn’t I’ll
make my own arrangements.”
* * * *
Back in his consulting-room Nicholas
spent a restless two hours. He knew that
the specially-prepared capsule left with the
blackmailer would keep him in oblivion till
midnight. He could not shake off the horror
of the discovery. His mind surged with
memories of the Christinas Eve in France
on which he had last seen the youth who
shared his quarters. A last-year medical
student, Ralph Marston had been allotted
to the staff of his hospital, and few young-
sters had done better work. They were in
a troublesome sector, and in 1917 did not
participate in the truce which had been
observed on many parts of the line. An
unexpected attack had suddenly given the
hospital a hundred new surgical cases and
supplies had run out. The attack had been:
followed by a local advance of the enemy
which cut off the hospital—left it high and
dry; an island round which surged attack:
and counter-attack. The supply of anaes-
thetics had run out and there were fifty
cases waiting for knife and scalpel. Ralph-
volunteered to get through to a base
hospital and bring supplies. There was.
a handshake with his comrades, a few
husky wishes of good luck, and he had
faded into the darkness. Next day, Christ-
mas Day, he had got back with a kit full of
supplies, and his timely arrival had saved
over thirty lives. Ralph would never dis-
cuss that excursion, but the staff learned
later that he had spent three hours in a shell-
hole, without any sign of wound, stunned by
the shock of an explosion. He was dazed
for days and never touched a surgical knife
again. Two months later he disappeared.
Between the two of them had been that
perfect trust and comradeship which springs:
up between those who share dangers in com-
mon. And there he was, an outlaw beyond 1
redemption. He remembered what the woman
had said —“the war blotted out the souls of
some men.” He knew when recovery from
the drug habit was hopeless, and there was
no hope for this man. Shellshock had upset
the delicate adjustment and balance of brain
cells, and nothing could bring him back to
the world of normal men.
* * * *
At midnight Dr. Nicholas was in the room
again. The blackmailer was still under the
influence of the capsule. A search under his
pillow discovered a woman’s handbag. He
opened it and found the bundle of letters.
For a long while he gazed at the remnant
sprawled on the bed. He was sure that no-
thing could save him. With the precision
of a surgeon he adjusted the needle of a
hypodermic, used it on the sleeper, and then
placed it on a table beside the bed. He
covered the sleeping figure and said :
“It won’t be a merry Christmas, old man,
but it will be —a peaceful one.”
Two days later an obscure paragraph in a
daily newspaper announced that an unknown
man, evidently a dope fiend, had been found
dead in bed, with an empty hypodermic be-
side him.
* * * *
On Christmas morning Dr. Nicholas wait-
ed impatiently for the woman who had
driven him back into the past. She was an
hour behind her appointment, and entered the
consulting-room without any effort at con-
cealment. All signs of fear had vanished.
She was almost radiant.
“Here is your handbag,” he said. “The
letters are inside. Burn them.”
“Did you have much difficulty in getting
them?” she asked.
“None at all. The man didn’t really
mean to blackmail you. He handed them
over without the slightest demur.”
“I hope you didn’t go to too much trouble.”
she said effusively. “You see I—l thought
you might fail, so I told my husband all
about it last night, and he said it wouldn’t
make any difference. He understood.”
The woman shivered at the laugh which
filled the room, it was so mirthless. And
that night as she secretly burned the letters,
she wondered why the doctor had risen as
though to strike her —why he had hunted
her from the consulting-room as she had
once thought her husband might hunt her
from her luxurious surroundings.

THE CHRISTMAS CAROL.


The Sacrament.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A NEAR the town of modern Tyre
There lived a lord of high degree,
Who followed with his eyes on fire
The marsh-light of his own desire
Through the long aisles of luxury.
His castle rose upon a steep,
With plumed and columned woods around;
Below the bold baronial keep
Were pastures green with kine and sheep
And unctuous meadows hawthorn-bound.
Upon his banquet-board were wines
From many a fair sun-bathed champain,
Rare vintages of purpled vines
Set round with such ripe fruit as shines
Like light on the Hesperian plain.
On mimic lakes the painted swan
Moved or was still, a white disdain,
Until the little waves were gone,
Soundless as light, to break upon
The gleaming beach of coral rain.
The peacock, his vain plumage eyed
To gleam approval of the day,
Strutted upon the lawn and cried;
Yet drowsy Echo scarce replied
Where listless in retreat she lay.
It seemed that garden had been sown
Of old, but not by hand of man,
With seed of purest Parian stone;
And from that seed there had upgrown
Faun, elfin and fantastic Pan.
There Aphrodite, chaste as Love,
Awakened in virginity,
White-bodied as a temple dove
And, visaged like a saint above,
Crooked from the leaves an amorous knee.
In this new Tyre there lived this man
Lusting for all the wide world’s wealth.
He had the leching hand of Pan,
The keenest feet that ever ran,
Cloven for speed despising stealth.
And yet one day said he: “I now .
Shall build a goodly tenement
To house my God, and I shall bow
My soul to Him and pay my vow,
For I am surely penitent.”
He did not know how God’s contempt
Spews from His mouth upon the swine
Repenting lusts that no more tempt
And bearing gifts that would exempt
From sins of women and of wane.
Nor how, with anger that appals
The very Hell beneath, His hold
Most heavily in judgment falls
Upon the bastard soul that calls
To buy redemption with his gold.
Therefore this man of sated lust
His urgent altar richly built;
And so this thing of lees and must,
This worm that writhed in golden dust,
Made overtures to God with guilt.
The; Ark of the old Covenant,
The seven golden candlesticks,
He placed them where the light aslant
From the stained glass fell sacrosanct
Upon the holy crucifix.
He knelt him down and would have prayed,
But started as he heard a sound.
He saw as at a masquerade
The' holy saints all disarrayed
And nudely dancing round and round.
He did not know his eyes of lust
Had lost their light for all but sin;
He did not know —the thing of dust—
His vision was himself and just—.
God naught without and all within.
THE LAP OF LUXURV.
He wondered why—this lordly man,
This dead and cracking chrysalis—
He saw the gentle Christ as Pan,
A bestial form that bleating ran
To Syrinx for her humid kiss.
He did not know the Christ in scorn
Long years before the cross had left;
He did not miss the eyes forlorn,
He did not miss the crown of thorn
Or know that his own feet were cleft.
But, bleating, he ran here and there,
This hispid soul still called a man,
From church to church with vacuous prayer.
They saw his goods and gold were fair.
And gave the sacrament to Pan!
M TT.AND.
DARIUS.
A Court of Appeal.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THERE is a point at which a man gives
up, however game he may be. Jack
Simpson had reached that point. For
over two months he had battled through wild
country south-west from Darwin, covering,
as he reckoned, something over 500 miles—
alone, short of tucker, the wet season coming
on, and with only the horse he had been
THE FACE AT THE WINDOW.
riding; and now that had gone, bogged to
the belly in a quagmire from which he had
barely managed to save his scanty gear. He
stood staring out hopelessly at the drenching
rain. It poured in a blinding sheet across
the gorge, down which countless small catar-
acts blundered into the swelling creek below.
The ledge where he sheltered was merely
one of the many shallow cavities worn in the
sandstone by ages of erosion. Though over-
hung with a jagged projection, it drizzled and
dripped with water from innumerable fis-
sures. But he had sought its cover not so
much from the rain (he was already wet
through) as from the wind; for years of
life in the north make a man susceptible
to the comparative chilliness of the deluging
gusts which, in the season of the north-
west monsoons, alternate with oppressive
heat. Although it was nearly noon, he had
not yet eaten anything that day. For one
thing, there was very little left in his tucker-
bag—a chunk of mouldy salt beef and a
sodden bit of stale damper. For another,
he had got along with so little food lately
that the feeling of physical emptiness did
not trouble him in comparison with the
mental emptiness that seemed to numb him
altogether—the sense of the end of things.
This was something new. He had experi-
enced nothing quite like it before, except
perhaps vaguely in the form of the need
for hope. Hardly hope itself, for he had
left that behind long ago; not deliberately or
even consciously—it had merely faded out,
dissolved like a mist, leaving the harsh lines
of life bare.
He was just a little puzzled to find himself
regretting his escape from gaol, the escapade
that had landed him in his present plight; for
he had till now taken that, like everything
else, as a matter of course. It had certainly
not been very difficulty As for the rest, once
outside and free again, he had known his
way about. He knew how to take advantage
of that camaraderie among bushmen which
leads them to help one of themselves who
happens to be in trouble, irrespective of how
he got into it or whether they know much
about him. One way or another, they all
get into tight corners often enough; and
the give-and-take of life in a country of
spacious risks blurs fine discriminations be-
tween resourcefulness and rascality. Owners
and managers of stations, however, are. apt
to look at things differently. So Jack Simp-
son, having—as he had put it in his brief
defence when brought to court at Darwin —
“borrowed a couple of crocks for a dry stage
of sixty miles or so,” was sent to the little
gaol outside Darwin for IS months with hard
labor. That was all, but it seemed stiff.
Now, as he changed his attitude and
squatted in this cavern on the steep, stony
hillside above the gorge, after a rough jour-
ney, during which he had seen no white
men and merely vanishing blacks, he thought
with a sort of ironic regret of the safety
of that little gaol, with its canvas stretcher
in the clean, bare cell, even though the air
was so close there at night; and of its tidily
kept yard, surrounded by a high but rather
ramshackle and (as he had proved) not alto-
gether insurmountable galvanised iron wall;
and most of all there kept recurring to him
a vision of the kitchen in the evening, with
the smell of food cooking, the rows of enamel
mugs and plates on white-scrubbed tables
and the red gleam of the fire in the stove —
a disturbingly homely recollection, mixed up.
somehow, with more distant memories of
the cosy fireside comfort of boyhood.
From time to time a shiver ran down his
spine at the contact of his wet shirt with
liis back. He suddenly felt weak and ill,
and thought of lying down then and there to
wait till the end came; but he held on to a
crude idea that this would be acting more
like a nigger than a white man —it was time
enough for a white man to stretch out to
it when he couldn’t sit up or stand up any
longer.
There was nothing abstract about life
for a man like Jack Simpson ; but now, for
the first time, life seemed to have got away
from its physical bearings. There was no-
thing to be done, nothing but to wait and
drift out of it. Perhaps, he thought, it would
be easier to lie down. He was about to do
this when the rain abated suddenly, then
stopped altogether. For a moment he list-
ened to the near, dull drippings and the
further roar of turbulent water. Soon he
rose stiffly to his feet. Anyhow, he would
go and have another look at that damned
horse.
He found that the track by which he had
come up from the
lagoon into which
the creek widened
further along was
now flooded over,
but he picked up
another thoug li
more circuitous
pad. He followed
this, and found that
it led to a different
part of the lagoon,
a small almost
separate sheet of
water. The track
turned sharply to-
ward this between
two grotesque,
towering pinnacles
of rock, then widen-
ed suddenly to a
little gravel beach,
sloping down to
clear water, and
not, like the other
part where he had
lost his horse, a
treacherous muddy
bog. He cursed
his luck at not
having struck this
spot in the begin-
ning. Then, turn-
ing toward the
abutting cliff in his
survey of the place,
he gaped in sudden
surprise.
“Hell!” he said,
and this sufficed
him for the first
shock of an aston-
ishment which he
presently ela b o-
rated as he saw,
completely and
roomily sheltered by
a receding archway
in the wall of the cliff, the litter of r camp,
with a figure stretched at full length in the
inner shadow, a man apparently asleep. He
went in toward it and cautiously leaned over.
The next minute he stirred the form with a
rough movement of his foot. This made a
muffled rattling noise like a bag of chips. The
man, whoever he was, had been dead some
time, for there was nothing but bones left.
The clothing had been torn and pulled about,
perhaps by dingoes, and the ants had cleared
up the rest. Jack Simpson apostrophised the
heap in his own way, profanely and pitifully,
but without much feeling of r.ny kind. He
looked round for any sign
of food, but there was none.
He seized a bundle wrapped
in a waterproof sheet. It
contained a fairly good outfit
of clothes. They were dry,
and, finding that they fitted
him near enough, he changed
into them, derisively flinging
his own soaked rags aside.
There was a small packet of
papers in one of the pockets.
He merely glanced at this
and put it back to look
through later on. A saddle
lay on the ground, but it was
almost in pieces, so he left
it where it was, though he
slung over his arm a halter
and bridle that he found.
He was about to step out
into the open again, when liis
ear caught the sound of slow
hoof-beats. He stepped back
quickly. This sudden move-
ment, in his weak condition,
made him dizzy, but he stood
alert, hidden in the shadow
The approaching hoof-beats
faltered in a way that
seemed to indicate that the
animal was riderless, and he
saw that this was so as it
passed the archway of the
cave. It disappeared toward
the edge of the pool, and
Jack Simpson heard it
drinking. He moved out
cautiously. The space by
the water’s edge was wide, but the defile
that led to it was so narrow that the horse
could not pass him coming back. It turned
from the water, snorting when it saw him,
but it was plainly no brumby. It must have
belonged to the dead man, and, he argued,
there might be others about, too. He moved
toward it gradually, pacifying it as he did
so, and in a little while he had the bridle
on it and was leading it away.
It did not take him long to reach his own
camp again. Life had once more quietly
become an ordinary if hazardous possibility,
though his body ached and he felt wretchedly
weak. He munched a bit of damper that
was left, and the mere action of eating re-
vived him a little. Then he remembered that,
in the coat which he had discarded with his
other clothes at the dead man’s camp, was a
small pocket-book. He had acquired this
before he set out, and in it were scrawled
rough locality sketches and directions for his
own guidance, with his name scribbled idly
in it here and there as well. He reflected
that it might give him away if anyone hap-
pened to find it, for there were strange
chances (he thought of the dead man and
wondered momentarily who he was) even m
such godforsaken spots as this. He put his
saddle on the horse with something like the
zest of a new possession, and rode at. a
walking pace down toward the cave again,
absorbed, as he went, in his intention some-
how to reach the Queensland border. He
still had, carefully covered from damp, a gun
and some ammunition, and at the worst the
game he could shoot would keep him alive.
With his thoughts running on in this way
he turned into the walled track, and it was
not till he took the turn toward the cave
that lie apprehended, by the sound of voices,
that someone else was there. He would have
turned back, but it was too late. He pulled
up his horse stock still. The dead man's
bones and belongings had been dragged out
of the cave into the light in a small heap,
and Simpson’s own discarded clothes had
been gathered together with them. Near by
was a plant of half a dozen horses and packs
in charge of two blackboys, one of whom
was tending a fire at which a billy was
being boiled. Kneeling down, in close
scrutiny of the pile before him, was an offi-
cer of the Northern Territory police, who
looked up quickly at Jack Simpson’s ap-
proach.
“Hullo!” he said, in a kind of breezy sur-
prise, but with an air of being prepared for
anything. “Quite a crowd about!” He was
a young man with pert, keen grey eyes. “Who
are you?” he added, rapping the words out
sharply.
“Simpson—Jack Simp” The bushman
got as far as that before he remembered, for
a sick feeling had come over him, and things
seemed to swim before his eyes. “At least,”
he added lamely, with an effort to pull him-
self together, “that’s a name I sometimes go
by.”
The policeman stood up slowly, eyeing the
other all the time. “Simpson, eh?” Sounds
like someone I’m looking for. Tell us some
of your other names, though.” Then, as he
saw Simpson slide weakly from his horse and
almost fall into a sitting position on the
ground, he added, “What, crook?”
“No tucker, that’s all.”
“Oh, that all!” The policeman turned to
the tracker at the fire. “Him not boil yet?
All right, boilem quickfeller, makem tea;
tucker all about, too. He wheeled round
quickly again, and, crossing over to where
Simpson sat, leaned over him and felt his
clothing where the pockets were. “No
squirt or anything? All right. Don’t
attempt to bolt, though I don’t suppose you
could. We’ll have a yarn about your affairs
directly, after you’ve had a feed. But I’ll
finish this job first.” He had gone back to
his task, speaking in matter-of-fact tones as
he went on turning over the things before
him.
Simpson sat dully watching him for a
while, wondering where he had seen him
before, for his face seemed vaguely familiar.
Then Simpson’s gaze wandered, as a matter
of habit, to the prospect of the weather. The
rain had passed away, and, though the sky
was still clouded, the dull heat grew steamily,
presaging one of those spells of fine weather
that are interspersed through the early
stages of the wet season. Ramparts of
rock rose high on all sides, pushing up
through masses of stunted vegetation. The
other side of the lagoon, so far as. it was
visible from this restricted angle, was a wall
of bamboos, paper-barks and pandanus palms,
round the roots of which floated great lily-
leaves. All sounds seemed subdued, sup-
pressed—even the babble of the two trackers,
the one moving among the horses and adjust-
ing their packs and shaking the water from
canvas covers; the other poking among the
ashes of the fire. Dripping liquid noises from
the nearer ledges made a scale of diminisli-
BY MUTUAL DISSENT.
“So you broke off your engagement with Miss Spensiff?”
“No, I didn't break it.”
“Oh, she broke it ?”
“No, she didn’t break it.”
“But it is broken ?”
“Yes, she told me what her clothes cost, and I told her
what my income was —and the .engagement sagged in
the middle and gently dissolved.”
ing notes against the recitative of the water
that rushed in the creek out of sight, seem-
ing far away. All this caught Simpson into
a sort of weary stupor, from which the voice
of the policeman, speaking in sharp tones,
presently roused him.
“There’s a pocket-book of yours in this
coat. You got a change of clothes from this
man’s kit, eh? A smart chap like you ought
to be able to cover up his tracks better than
that. Find any papers?’”
By way of answer Simpson took out the
small, flat bundle, which was tied with string,
and tossed it across to the policeman, who
caught it and took out an addressed and
post-marked envelope and- some horse-
receipts and bills. These he methodically un-
folded and spread out.
“That’s funny now,” he remarked, after a
short examination. “A coincidence, if you
like! Jim Green, dirty old Jim Green.
D’you remember old Jim Green?” He looked
across at Simpson inquiringly.^
Simpson silently shook his head.
“No? Well, I won’t introduce you, for
various reasons. For one, the only: other
time I ever saw you, you were with him.
“Not me,” Simpson said.
The policeman eyed Simpson quizzically,
but said nothing. Then he rolled skeleton
and rags into a comparatively neat bundle
and jotted down some notes a writing-
pad, which he put aside with Simpson s
pocket-book. “I think that’ll do. Here,
Timbuk.” he called to the tracker m charge
of the horses. “Pickem up”—he indicated
the bundle at his feet—“and carry em alonga
bauliinya tree where two-feller track come
close up together. By-em-by digem hole,


huryem; but leavem there and come back
first time. That’s right.” He grinned
cheerily after the boy. and murmured,
“Funerals arranged at the shortest notice;
pinking done.” He turned to Simpson again.
“That’s a policeman's life for you in a coun-
try like this—all sorts of jobs, and _ a beat
of anything over five hundred miles.” He
went off to the water’s edge with some soap
and a towel, and washed his hands.
The boy had everything ready for the meal,
and stones provided the tAvo men Avith dry
seats. Both were hungry, but Simpson ate
ravenously. It was weeks since he had had
a drink of tea, and the luxury of the scald-
ing beverage, Avith fresh damper and a piece
off a steak cooked under the hot ashes,
almost brought tears to his eyes—weak
tears of self-pitiful emaciation.
“Feel better now, I suppose?” said the
policeman when both had finished and the
trackers were wolfing what was left. "Welt,
let’s get down to business. You’re Jack
Simpson. Got away from Darwin Gaol, eli?
How the devil you got through this part of
the country, as far as this, beats me, though
the last mail brought instructions to go
round a bit looking for you, damn you ! They
said you were supposed to be making for
the Gulf country, and you’d naturally dodge
the stock route, though this way’s the very
deA il.”
"What’ll they give me now?” Avas all that
Simpson said.
“Another six or twelve months —perhaps —
don't know, really. Possibly they’ll just hang
you as a first offender.” He seemed quite
iiappy to be able to run on garrulously, like
a talkative man who is compelled to spend
much of his time alone. Simpson, still
puzzled by an indefinite recollection of his
lace, was himself glad enough to meet another
human being after the lonely xveeks of fur-
tive and hardly progressive prowling, in
comparison with Avhich the prospect of a
further term of imprisonment liaraiy seemed
to matter. The policeman rattled on: “You
don't remember me? B’unny thing, for, as I
say, the only other time I’ve seen you, you
Avere with his nibs” —he jerked his head back
toward the track —“Jim Green, deceased.
How long is it since you were at Borroloola
last?”
“Must be five years,” replied Simpson,
after a moment's reflection. “That’s where
I’ve seen you, I suppose, then?”
“That AA'ould be about the time. I brought
old Jim up over a row in a black’s camp
about a lubra he fancied. The magistrate
fined him a tenner or six months. He had
no money and you paid the fine. Remember
noAv?”
“Oh, that old”
“Gentleman,” interrupted the policeman.
“Did he ever pay you back?”
“Never suav him again—-didn’t expect to.
I’d been droving, and happened to have some
money at the time, that’s all.”
“Um.” The policeman was thoughtful for
a moment. “Well, about your own affair —
horse-stealing, eh? Serious, y’ know.”
“Serious!” Jack Simpson’s mouth curled
scornfully. “In unfenced country, where
they’re let run wild and nobody cares and
a man might die on a dry stage if he didn’t
borrow one or two at a pinch! Like me. I
took two Avith Jenkins’s brand on. Honest,
I’d have let ’em go as soon as I got to Bright
Creek; Avouldn’t have been fool enough to
keep ’em. But the luck was against me—•
and everybody knows what Jenkins is. Any-
how, Avhat’s the use of talking? I’m your
prisoner now, and” —-— He indicated Avith
a gesture the uselessness of further comment.
The policeman cocked his head on one side
in a non-committal, judicial sort of Avay. "It
sounds plausible enough. Why didn’t you
tell that to the Court? You got off light.
They could have given you seven or eight
years.”
“Tell them?” Jack Simpson laughed bit-
terly. “Of course I told them. But I had
no cash to pay a lawyer, and nearly every-
thing I said wasn’t evidence, or something
Avas wrong Avith it, so I just shut up in dis-
gust, and Jenkins’s laAvyer pushed hard—
for the sake of example, lie said. But it’s
the God’s truth, anyhoAV!”
The policeman stared hard at Simpson, and
Simpson stared hard back.
“It’s a wicked world, Simpson,” said the
former at last. “And if ever you’re roped

country get a start with other people’s clean-

late lamented friend, old Jim Green there,
owes you something, and ought to be made to
part up?”
“What d’you mean?” asked Simpson, his
brow puzzlingly wrinkled. Then he grinned
understandingly. “Well, that’s his horse I
suppose I’ve got, if that’s Avliat you mean.
Rub it in. 1 don’t care much. My nag's

“No. I didn’t mean that,” said the police-
man slowly and thoughtfully. “But one
good turn deserves another, and Well,

denly shot a piercing glance across at the
bushman. “You’ve never rounded on a man
who did you a good turn, I suppose?”
Simpson merely returned the other’s gaze
steadily, but with a kind of savage contempt.
The necessity of any other answer did not
occur to him.
The policeman laughed. “You look like a

FREDERIOK T. MACARTNEY.
The Cradle of Civilisation.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
JONES told us that the cradle of human
civilisation was exactly sixty-two
miles from Sydney.
Herbertson and I both sat up and looked
serious. Jones was evidently in dead earnest
and spoke in tones of absolute conviction.
Herbertson suspected that the thing was an
elaborate jest; but I, knowing Jones better,
feared insanity.
It was Jones who had found the Tiboo-
burra skull, Jones avlio had proved the theory
of circular neolithic nature-worship and had
shown its development from the triangular
faith of the earlier stone ages, Jones who
had reconstructed the life system of the
Etruscans, and Jones who pointed out the
fundamental errors in the generally accepted
theory of the relations of the Hellenes to the
/Egeans of Crete and Cyprus. Altogether
Jones was a very remarkable man, but even
the most remarkable man may lose his men-
tal balance; and it seemed to me that much
learning had made the great professor mad.
“I’ve noticed that myself,” said Herbert-
son, after the first pause of surprise. “It
folloAved naturally from my discovery of the
tomb of Alexander the Great at Bathurst.”
Jones half rose from the table with an
angry light in his eye; then sighed and sat
down again with his hands nervously grip-
ping the table-edge.
“Alexander belongs to our own age,” he
said. “Where lie was buried and what he
did matters very little. I am talking about
the early Avorld, not the world of yesterday.”
“Tell us about it,” I said.
Again he rose from the table and, push-
ing back his chair, turned to an Oriental
cabinet on the right. Herbertson winked at
me and I frowned heavily.
Jones, with fingers that trembled and a
touch that was almost reverent, laid a curi-
ous metal tray on the table. The tray was
circular, massive and about fourteen inches
in diameter. The inner part was slightly
cupped and perforated by four large circular
holes; the rim Avas flat with raised edges
which were deeply milled and embossed with
characters from some unfamiliar alphabet.
“To what period of art in what land does
that object belong?”
I shook my head.
“It looks like a sacrificial dish of some
kind,” I ventured.
But Herbertson thumped the table.
“A trousers button of the Titans,” he
shouted. “Prometheus must have lost it in
the first bush-fire.”
The Professor blinked joyously through his
glasses.
"My OAvn conjecture,” he said, rubbing his
hands. “The button—not necessarily of any
particular garment—of a giant race of men
avlio once inhabited Australia.”
He rose again and went to the cabinet.
"What w’ould you take this to be?”
There was no mistaking the object he set
on the table. It Avas the broken-off neck of
an enormous bottle, the glass dark-green in
color and a couple of inches in thickness.
Even Herbertson Avas awed by the thought
of the massive grandeur of the receptacle for
liquid of which it must once have formed a
part.
"These,” said Jones solemnly, “are the basic
proofs of my theory. Here we have the
tAvo chief elements of true progress—the but-
ton and the bottle. The construction of
pyramids and temples, the building of cities
and' the excavation of canals, are all minor
matters; but where the
button and the bottle
have a foremost place cul-
ture is real and inten-
sive.”
* *
A Aveek later Herbert-
son was goading an un-
kindly packhorse through
a ravine in the moun-
tains, while Jones and I
staggered under the
weight of our oavh sAvags
and tools. About us on
eA r ery hand Avere huge
sandstone cliffs to wlncii
gnarled trees and slender
saplings clung precari-
ously. Little waters sang
among the boulders at
our feet, and abo\ T e us the
sky was a broad river of:
blue. We had seen no
sign or mark of human
agency for hours. If
early giant races had
stumbled and perspired
over these boulders the
place had enjoyed a long
rest since.
Towards evening the
valley widened, and we
came to a halt on a bush-
covered mound a few
acres in extent which-
Avas enclosed in a loop of
the creek. The ground
was of sandy formation, and in the face of
the cliff beyond was a wide-mouthed cave.
“It is here we must dig,” said Jones.
“Let us pitch our camp and rest for the
night, dreaming of to-morroAv’s great dis-
coveries.”
A slight argument then arose about pitch-
ing the tent. Herbertson said the open
ground was good enough for anyone to camp
on; and Jones and I were at last per-
suaded to leave it at that. We feasted in
the light of the rising moon, while the west
was still red and a full mosquito chorus filled
the valley.
I have always been a delectable prey for
the musical tormentors of the night; and
■while Jones occasionally smote at the air
without disturbing his archaeological dreams
and Herbertson slumbered in the armor of
his own impervious hide, I continued an
unequal battle until I was forced to retreat.
As I shuffled out of my blankets the full
silver of the moon shone on bush and tree.
I noted the long shadows falling slantwise
over the cliffs, the black mouth of the cave
and the gem-like sparkle on the rippling
Avater. If digging was to be done, why not
dig now? It would be hot in the daytime
and possibly I could then find a shade in
which to sleep.
I began my excavation in the soft sand
behind a huge boulder which stood on the
highest part of the mound. The shovel sank
easily into the yielding stuff, and I was
soon waist deep in a circular hole. Twice
I unearthed a large fragment of glass, and
once a metallic object of some sort. I set
these things in an open space and Avent on
digging.
Then I came on the skull.
The removal of the soft sand around the
curving dome left no doubt Avhatever as to
the nature of my find. Almost before I
Avas aware of it I was standing on the vast
forehead of primeval man.
My excitement was too great to permit me
to continue the work alone. I roused Jones;
I dragged Herbertson, raging, from his blan-
kets.
We all worked with desperate zeal in the
moonlight. We laid bare the whole four feet
of cranium; we removed the sand from the
eighteen feet of skeleton ; Ave found the great
gold ring, set with what appeared to be a
block of dark garnet: we discovered the
abnormal length of the feet and the dispro-
portioned size of the great toe.
In the period of darkness between moonset
and daAvn we sat around our treasure and
talked of the sensation which our find
would cause. A sharp wind came up the
valley and we shivered. Then Herbertson
accidentally kicked something.
He was sitting near the mouth of the
skeleton ; and as he put down his hand he
touched a familiar substance.
“A bottle,” he said, and struck a match.
It was a bottle sealed and Avired —a bottle
four feet long and a foot in diameter that two
of us with difficulty lifted from its sandy
bed.
“Full!” said Herberton. “Who wants a
drink?”
The Professor mildly protested against the
removal of the cork, but Herbertson Avas not
to be denied. He brought a pannikin and
poured out a fexv drops. By the light of
a flaring match we suav him smack his lips. _
“God knows what it is,” he said, “but this
old chap doesn’t need it and I do.”
It may have been madness or it may have
been the highest wisdom known to archseolo-
gists, but avc all drank from that bottle.
The sun rose over the valley, a strange
orange globe of fire which continually shot
forth silver sparkles. A flood of color swept
over the sandstone w'alls and avc were sud-
denly aware of the singing of the creek —
not a faint tinkle among the stones, but
a steady roar of Avater.
“Must have been raining higher up,” said
Herbertson. “By Jove, the water has come
down!”
The mound on which avc stood had become
an island and we rushed to the lower end,
wdiere we had hobbled the horse and left our
possessions, in the fear that we might be
cut off.
We were indeed cut off and by a roaring
volume of flood wmter that none of us dared
to cross; but our dismay Avas of short dura-
tion, for we suddenly saw from the angle
w 7 here we now stood what had been for-
merly hidden by trees and bushes —a great
hump-backed bridge of rough stone, and be-
yond the bridge a paved roadwmy winding
into the gorge of the creek.
“Come on,” cried Jones.
He seemed to cross the island in a dozen
strides, and Ave were close on his heels. The
road was hard and smooth under our feet;
it climbed steeply from the valley, and Ave
were soon in a broad avenue of shady
eucalyptus-trees of immense, size and beauty.
The Professor plucked a leaf and seemed to
wonder; but he went on Avith his head held
high and a look of ecstasy in his eyes.
When we came to the city gate, flanked
under the to\vering walls by masses of gor-
geous flowering plants, we were challenged
by the two giant sentinels A\ r ho stood with
spears crossed in our path.
Jones went on as if he did not see them,
and one of them suddenly grappled with
Herbertson in what looked like a bear’s hug.
The big fellow, on the left pushed at me
with his spear. T grasped the thing to divert
it from my throat, and heard the shaft
crackle and break in my hand. The next
moment we were all within the city, sur-
rounded by a curious throng of huge men
and women in many-colored dresses who set
up a tremendous cry of welcome.
Jones xvas no longer the leader. It Avas
Herbertson to whom the crowds boAVed.
Herbertson for Avlioni the bells mnv
clashed out from every high place. They
wore supporting him on either hand, waving
their scarves towards him and generally treat-
ing him like a favored leader returned after
absence.
“What does it all mean?” I said to Jones,
with Avlioni I had fallen into the second line
of the procession.
He did not answer. There were tears
streaming from his eyes, and he Avas freely
using his handkerchief.
Suddenly, as if from nowhere, a white
coach, driven by no visible power, appeared
in the street, and in it was a tall, fair
woman. She leaped from her place, fell on
her knees before Herbertson and coA'ered his
hands with kisses.
The crowd roared its approval, and the
carriage, with Herbertson and the lady in
the midst of the tumult, passed out of sight,
leaving Jones and myself sitting alone on
the kerbstone of the deserted street.
“What does it all mean?” I asked again.
He shook his head.
“A Avorld restored from a trousers-button.”
he sobbed, and leant heavily against the lamp-
post.
I left him, and followed the diminishing
noise up the street. The whole city seemed
full of light and color, but utterly deserted.
I was sleepy. I wanted a cool place to lie

gether too fatiguing.
The second room on the first floor of
the house at the corner had two beds, and
both were clean and -white. In three minutes
I was fast asleep.
The steam siren of the train awakened
me. I looked round and tried to find my
bearings. The ground under me was very
haTd, and the early sun Avas just peeping
over the eastern ridge. There was a weather-
board cottage visible among the trees, and a
glimpse of a tiled roof farther away. I rose
stiff and sore, and made my way towards
the railway line. The little station lay in
a sleepy hollow' a quarter of a mile to the
right.
I reached the place by crossing two barbed-
wire fences, and read the familiar name.
Dazed as I was, the knowledge of my wdiere-
aboijts brought me a sense of comfort.

saw .Tones. He was sitting hunched up on a
seat with his head between his hands.
“What the matter?” I said. “What's it

That a man would trouble me sore,
With his heels on the bed,
And his hat on his head,
And the track of his feet on the floor!
I’ve all that I want. I haven’t a care,
My time is my own, says she;
And my soul is my own,
As I sit down alone
When I dish up the victuals for tea.
I’ve sheets of linen, I’ve towels to bleach,
I’ve counterpanes whiter than snow;
And it’s all for myself,
To the tins on the shelf,
And the teacups that hang in a row.
So why should I trouble to walk at the double
Who still at the single can stay,
With no one to worry,
And no one to hurry,
And no one to muddle my day?
There’s my next-door neighbor over the road,

And her nerves are a thread,
For she’s never to bed
Till the doctor and nurse are in sight;
The last to her rest, the first to awake,
She sleeps like a clock at “Alarm!”
For a stir in a cot
And she’s out like a shot,
With the baby slung under her arm.
Not an hour have ever I lost of sleep;
Not a man I’d have on my mind,
And him staying out late,
With a tale of a mate,
And the breath of him shouting liis kind !
There’s Paddy McShane came courting me

An eye to the half of my bed;
But, says I to McShane,

Who still at the single can stay,
With no one to worry,
And no one to hurry,

Blue Gums.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THEY came up out of the coastal swamp
like a long, black snake emerg-
ing from its hole. And saw gums.
Australian gums! Smith could have wept
on the dusty floor of Africa at the sight,
although he had been prepared for it. The
low, brown hills, dull, brown earth and scat-
tered clumps of eucalypti were so familiar.
Like Smith’s own Emu Plains, only the
hills were a little sharper, the sky was not
so soft and the shadows of the gums fall-
“TREE POLITENESS”
JONES ( always the perfect gentleman, as his parachute
collapses): “Excuse me going first.”
ing on the mud walls of native villages were
somehow sinister. Not so the gums them-
selves. The gums, so Smith had heard, had
brought civilisation to Bahomey. Before
their introduction the Bahomans had been
nomads. They had erected their miserable
towns near any timber that remained to
them, and when they had used it up they
had moved on to the next source of supply.
Even their capital was not exempt from
this necessity, until some stray foreigner at
the court of the late king suggested the
planting of the quick-growing blue-gum.
That was thirty years ago, and now the
capital stood in the middle of a magnificent
forest; and wherever else the trees had got
a grip, settled habits had grown upon the
people.
The black serpent of native carriers, of
which Smith in his hammock formed the
tail, wound up into the sharp-toothed hills.
Smith reflected with becoming pride that
he, too, was bringing civilisation, in the
shape of a radio broadcasting and receiving
outfit, to Bahomey.
Beyond the saw-like hills they came out
on a wide, brown plateau centred by a deep
blue lake, in which was mirrored Ddah, the
capital, and its forest of encircling gums.
Nobody came out from the city, which slept
like the victim of a drug under the heat of the
afternoon sun. They passed under the low
gateway of the city and wound between the
silent huts until they came to another wall
and another gateway, which was the en-
trance to the palace of the king.
Smith was installed that night in a hut,
a little larger than the rest, under two
sacred blue-gums that occupied the centre
of the royal square before the palace, and
had been the first trees planted by King
Tembandumba’s father. The next morning
he set his boys unpacking the scores of cases
containing the unassembled elements of
KDK. KI)K was the official title, duly re-
gistered, of King Tembandumba’s wireless
station. The shiny, fat, enormous savage
with the great stooping shoulders and the
long arms and bent knuckles who called him-
self the Prime Minister came regularly across
to call on Smith, scaring Coffee, the coast
boy who was to be Smith’s apprentice, into
impotence.
His Majesty, mumbled the Prime Minister,
was a very progressive monarch, like his
father, who had planted the civilising gum-
trees ; but he was more impatient. He had
expected to see the new invention in proper
working order on the day of Smith’s arrival,
and when he was told that the installation
would take three months to complete, his
Majesty would be extremely disappointed.
He had sent a slave girl to inform his late
lamented royal father that he would be
in daily radio communication with him im-
mediately, and now he would have to de-
spatch another to contradict the first. Mes-
sengers, he grumbled, were running short
and getting most expensive.
The Prime Minister had dull red eyes with
muddy whites, and came close to Smith, who
was a little man, to mumble his sombre
threats. lie would watch Smith, busy direct-
ing the laying of the bed-plate for his engine
and dynamo, for half an hour or so in silence,
hoping for some sign of trepidation in the
white man; then lie would waddle home
across the courtyard.
In that mysterious city of silent houses
that looked like the opaque bubbles thrown
up by a volcanic mud-bath, there was one
other white man to lighten the solitude of
Smith. Korswagen was a Dutchman whom
the progressive potentate had summoned to
set up a factory for making American ice-
cream sundaes. His job was nearly over,
and it only remained for him to instruct his
native assistants in the mysteries of the craft
before lie would be able to collect liis salary
and depart. He sat on the broken packing-
cases stroking his dew-lapped chin and laugh-
ing ponderously at Smith’s enthusiasm over
his civilising work of bringing Bahomey into
the stream of modern communications.
“This progressive country, my friend,” he
shouted, “had a system of radio communi-
cation before you were born.”
“Explain yourself, mynheer,” said Smith,
wiping the sweat from his freckled face.
“Och kom! ' grinned Korswagen. “Why,
his Majesty sent an etliergram only the other
day to the late lamented scoundrel they call
his father to apprise him of your august
arrival. They are sending another to-night
to acquaint him of the fact that the new
method of transmission has unavoidably been
postponed. Listen!”
Smith heard with stiffly rising hair be-
yond the wall of the compound in which
liis hut stood a rush of naked feet, a gut-
tural moaning drowned in a hideous chant-
ing of savage voices, a thud, an exultant
shout and silence.
“That, mynheer, is the way
they have of sending mes-
sages in Bahomey,” mur-
mured Korswagen, his fat
gills a little tremulous de-
spite his assumption of in-
difference. Smith remem-
bered observing a row of
heads with staring eyes and
fallen chaps hanging over
the gateway to the King’s
palace. At the time he had
imagined that they dated
from before the time when
the blue-gums brought civil-
isation to Bahomey.
Radio, thought Smith,
might at least ameliorate a
barbarous custom and be the
means of saving hundreds of
innocent lives; and the
thought spurred him to fresh
efforts to get his installation
finished. What with erect-
ing aerials, wiring instru-
ments and testing apparatus
whose insulation had been
lowered by that infernally
hot, damp climate, he had
little time to look around
him ; but what he saw of the
life of King Tembandumba’s
loyal subjects did not make
him any the less anxious to
be finished and away. It
shook Smith’s faith in the
civilising power even of
radio when he saw laughing groups of
men, women and children, like week-enders
going to a picnic, carrying, instead of ther-
mos-flasks and sandwiches, portions of fel-
low-human beings in baskets on their heads.
Nevertheless he went stolidly ahead with
the job he had to do, obtaining solace and
refreshment of spirit from the companion-
ship of the two noble blue-gums round which
the witch-doctors had planted circles of
white-washed stones. Inside the circle it
was death for any living thing to go. And
one morning Smith had to watch a lonely
’possum, seeking sanctuary amongst the
upper branches, hounded down and decapi-
tated and its' head placed with other male-
factors over the palace gates.
Well within the time Smith had allowed
himself the installation was completed. One
evening he put the Morse key down and the
sharp spluttering discharge was like the voice
of succor to him; and when, in answer to
his testing call, a dozen stations started send-
ing liis call-signal in return, he felt the thrill
a castaway feels on a desert island when
he sees a passing vessel alter her course in
acknowledgment of his signal. But Kors-
wagen got no consolation from it.
“Your verdomde radio won’t lift you out
of Bahomey with the gold and ivory which
that ebon Satan owes you. Not by a rail-
lion miles! And I wouldn’t be so damn
keen, if I was you, to teach that black slave
of yours how to work your box of tricks.
White men always fall sick in Baliomey as
soon as their assistants learn enough to carry
on. They fall sick, and very many times
they die.”
That, he murmured sombrely, was what
had happened to the English engineer who
had brought the steam launch up and put
it on the lake. And worse had happened to
the German who had introduced the grand
piano for the ladies of the court to learn to
play on; but the less said about that the
better. And his turn was coming next be-
cause his black batman could mix sundaes
now as well as he could.
The miasma of an unpleasant doom seemed
to overflow the walls of the silent palace into
the dusty, sun-baked royal square, filling
Smith’s nostrils with the odors of corruption.
The leaves of the gums hung listless in the

in Australia, had courage to sing its song in
their forbidden shade.
“You’re a nice young fellow,” said Ivors-
wagen with a wistful air. “Don’t let that
fat swine the Prime Minister come, near
you—he carries some pricking poison in his
palm. When they want to decorate you with
the Order of the Black Boot or anything of
that sort, you'll need to look about you.”
The Prime Minister came more often now
to see Smith. Entering the doorway of the
hut he would stoop low so that his bent
fingers made furrows through the dust, and
lie would stand close when he talked, so that
his moist breath would stir Smith's short,
fair hair. He was very solicitous about the
progress of Smith's understudy. The under-
study was getting on very well indeed, Smith
told him.
“His Majesty,” the Prime Minister mumbled
into Smith's neck, “is gratified at the
conscientious way you have tried to fulfil
your contract. He regrets you are unable
yet to get in touch with his late lamented
father, but he feels sure that that will be
remedied shortly. In the meantime he de-
sires to show you a mark of his royal favor
by investing you to-morrow evening at a
full session of the Court with the Distin-
guished Order of the Left Femur of Ternban-
dumba. Unfortunately the other white man
will not be present. He was privately .made
a Ivniglit of the same Order at 10 o’clock
this morning, and the unexpected honor was
too much for him. He complains this after-
noon of feeling indisposed.”
The Prime Minister stared malevolently
through the doorway at the thrush which
was sitting in one of the sacred gums filling
the courtyard with melodious sound; and
then he waddled away in the direction of
the palace. When his figure had dis-
appeared inside the gateway, Smith re-en-
tered his hut, to find Coffee in a state of
frightful agitation. He was a conscientious
operator, and Smith had reason to believe his
uncouth body housed an honest soul.
“Master,” he said, “that message of the
Prime Minister means you are to die, be-
cause you have taught me how to harness
this foreign spirit and tune-in on varying
wave-lengths. The King’s late father has to
be informed. A slave-girl of the palace who
has been kind to me in this lonely place has
told me that this was coming, both to you
and to the other white man.”
“Coffee,” said Smith, “your susnicions are
probably well founded, and it just shows
the folly of letting other people into one’s
trade secrets. Nevertheless, I feel there
must be some way of getting out of this with
honor and profit to us all, and I propose,
while you tune-in to 3LO, to think it
out.”
Smith sat down at the window of his hut
where he could see the trunks of the sacred
blue-gums standing like two clean soldiers
upright against the hard African sky. A
million insects like a swarm of golden atoms
were violating the taboo, and homing birds
alighted for a moment amongst the sacred
branches, chirruped and flew on. Smith
sat and communed with his fellow-exiles
until he could no longer see their shapes
clearly through the night. Then he went in
and whispered to his boy what he had re-
solved to do.
At midnight Smith was summoned into
the presence of his Majesty Tembandumba.
They had set his throne between the two sacred
gum-trees, one of which threw its shadow
across the royal head. The royal head was
bald, and its owner a puling infant; which
explained the overbearing authority dis-
played on all occasions by the Prime Min-
ister.
Smith was never afterwards able clearly
to recall the sequence of the interminable
ceremonies which preceded liis inauguration.
He retained a memory of the Prime Minister
endeavoring to encourage him from behind
the throne with ingratiating grins; fie re-
membered an obscene dance by semi-naked
hags; the da _ a o f f

At that moment a voice that made every-
body in the courtyard pause and the 1 rime
Minister hesitate in mid career resounded
through the air. Its dulcet tones bi ought
hot tears to the very heart ot Smith. _ He
felt invisible threads joining him to a thou-

North Shore, to lonely boundary-riders huts
and neat sitting-rooms in soldier-settlers

him.

had made the magic. “I always knew you
were a clever kerel.” He chuckled solemnly
for half a mile. “But it was very brave

walking on the other side, “to fix those

and switch on the current when you got

The Fisherman.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
DOWN ill a valley hid by mist,
An old man sits alone;
And in a pool by sun unkissed,
Unruffled, grey as stone,
Sits memory with hook and line,
Casting for things that once were mine.
For all the hours that went their Avay
Since first I saAv the sun
Lie drowned within this pool of grey,
Waiting their fellows one by one
That, as my appointed days depart,
Like drops of blood fall from my heart.
The ancient fisher stirs the deep,
And brings again to the light
Many an hour that fell to sleep
Bearing its burden dark or bright—
Burdens I loved and sometime swore
To cherish for ever, but love no more.
Now will he lay upon his hand
The form of an ancient sin,
A sin once sought, that, like a brand,
Seared deep my soul within ;
Or he takes a deed that still can hold
The richness of its heart of gold.
And then he shows me other prey
That wrings me with old grief.
He sets again some youthful play
That in its time I found too brief—
Alarms long perished, hatred dead,
Loves once confessed and ventures fled.
Times are I AA r ould that he might cease
And leave spent hours to lie
Deep in oblivion’s pool at peace.
Let their remembrance pass me by;
But for the wisdom that he brings
I bid him cast for all these things.
VICTORIA.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
SNORES came from the sprawded forms
of the blackboy crew on the deck
for’ard and deep breathing from the
two white men astern. A star-beam slant-
ing off the polished mainmast rested steadily
across Reynolds’s brow, its pale light appear-
ing to divide the strong brown face. But
the sleeper neither knew nor cared.
No water gurgled along the cutter’s sides.
The tide was at its height, stationary and
silent. Nearly three miles across the chan-
nel. loomed the two conical peaks of Hovvich
Island. Behind them was an indistinguish-
able smudge merging into the water, like an
immense patch of spilt ink —the mangroves,
sucking their life from out the black mud
of the ocean.
Clear and distinct came the eight sharp
clangs of a ship’s bell. ' Before the musical
notes had been absorbed by the air the white
men were sitting up inquiringly. The black
crew tossed aside their blankets, slumber-
dazed. But no big ship loomed above them,
no towering maze of lights; no throb of
engines was heard.
“What on earth” began Reynolds.
“Did you hear it?”
“Yes,” said Harris. “Eight bells. A
steamer.”
“Where ?”
They stood up, searching the Avaters. But
there was no steamer: only tiny Coquette
Island beside them, Howich’s tAvo peaks
and the black smudge.
“Strange,” said Reynolds, puzzled. “I
could have sworn”
“And I too. But we must have been mis-
taken. A.nd just glimpse the boys!”
“Turn in,” said Reynolds softly; “we don’t
want them catching the jim-jams. What the
explanation is I’m hanged if I know, but if
the boys get hearing spooks this cruise is
done.”
The two men were soon breathing deeply.
The boys, reassured by the white men’s un-
concern, yaAvned, coiled again in their blan-
kets and imniediately hurt the air with the
noise of their sleep. The tide, now on the
turn, sent a low rippling laugh from bow to
stern of the cutter.
Night again, and the stars, and the silence
of the Barrier Sea. A smell of opened pearl-
shell from the cutter’s deck mingled with
the faint scent of tobacco smoke. Reynolds
opened questioning eyes.
“Can’t sfeep,” explained Harris softly.
“Thinking of that bell. It was about this
time last night”
Across the waters again clanged the
strokes of a ship’s bell.
The men, white and black, sprang up,
eyes wide, breath short, listening.
“Seemed to come from the heart of the
mangroves on Howich Island,” said Harris
incredulously. “But it can’t. Impossible!
There’s not a living soul cn that speck. And
there’s not a shiD in sight.”
The crew shuffled close together for’ard.
Uneasy glances were shot towards the white
men.
Reynolds yawned unconcernedly. “Mine
been tliinkit ship’s bell wash in longa man-
groves.” he spoke aloud; “catch up longa
tree. Wind blow him about.”
Sudden relief spoke in the quick laugh
for’ard. Making fun of their oavii fears the
creAv turned in.
"I can’t make it out,” said Reynolds
thoughtfully. “To-morrow I’ll go out with
the fishing boats. You slip off in the dinghy
and look over the island. There might just
nossibly be someone there. There must be.
But Avhy ring a ship’s bell at 12 o’clock at
night the Lord only knoAVs!”
* * # »
“There’s not a sign of a living soul on the
island,” whispered Harris. “I examined every
inch of the place. All except the mangroves,
of course. There are a hundred acres of
them, a forest of mud and crooked trees,
with a few creeks from the sea running
through. When the tide is out it’s soft mud
and water pools. When it’s in the water is
right up among the tree branches. No human
being could possibly live there.”
“Of course not,” said Reynolds. “I only
thought some beachcomber might have
squatted between the tAvo little hills.”
“The place is absolutely uninhabited,” an-
swered Harris with conviction.
Up for’ard a blanket was cautiously raised,
a woolly head was pushed up. Presently the
head jerked back under the blanket.
“That’s bad,” whispered Reynolds ; “they’re
listening, too. They’ll want to clear out of
this just as we’ve found a good patch of
shell. I hope that”
Clear across the Avaters clanged the first
sharp stroke of a ship’s bell.
The creAv were instantly on their feet.
“You boys go to bunk,” ordered Reynolds.
“What dam-fool rot this!”
“We fright alonga bell,” answered the
head boy softly.
“Him only bell washed ashore longa man-
groves.” said Reynolds confidently. “Wind
bloAv him.”
“No wind,” said the black boy quickly.
“Tide shakem branches,” answered Rey-
nolds instantly.
“Tide no turn yet,” said the boy.
The two white men made a pretence of
turning in. But the crew, drawing nearer
to the white men, crouched together against
the mainmast, blankets drawn tight round
shivering shoulders, frightened eyes peering
out across the Avater.
“This is serious,” whispered Reynolds.
“All fishing is off now until we find out.
There is someone tolling a bell among those
mangroves. Otherwise it could never occur
always exactly at midnight. There’s never
a steamer visible, and the bell can’t toll from
the bottom of the sea.”
“Only one way to find out,” answered
Harris. “Particularly nasty—and risky too.
When the tide covers both reef and man-
groves, take a boat and row up one of the
sea-creeks between the trees.”
“We’ll both go,” said Reynolds' decidedly,
“and take two of the boys. When we come

back they can pass on to the others Avhat
will turn out to be the simple explanation
of the uncanny business.”
* * * *
The dinghy, just out in the channel from
the spreading coral reef that surrounds
lloAvich Island, back-paddled. The tvro
blackboys at the oars, trembling Avith fright,
cast longing eyes at the cutter lying Jpack
against Coquette Island.
“Better Avait until the tide's stationary,”
said Harris from the boAvs. “The Avater is
still rushing over the island from every
side of the sea. If we go in iioav Ave’ll simply
be sucked into the mangroves.”
Later on the dinghy crawled forward.
Over the broad coral reef lisped five feet
of water. Beyond that the sea stretched
into a great silent blackness. Harris, peer-
ing ahead, called instructions. Barely per-
ceptible, a creek-mouth yawned in the black-
ness. The dinghy entered, and Avas lost im-
mediately, walled in by millions of trees
whose branches reached out ovei’head and
blocked the sky.
A hissing stream of fire whizzed from be-
side the boat. Sheeny green and yellow
flame ran up the oar-blades arid dropped as
brilliant bubbles into the dinghy. Streaks
of criss-cross fire stabbed the blackness of
the creek as startled fish darted in to escape
from the pursuing shark.
The dinghy crept slowly ahead into a
black world teeming with vicious life. The
great fishes from the ocean had followed the
little fishes into this luscious feeding-ground
and were making the most of their time
before the waters swirled them out again.
For half an hour the dinghy crept on, a
ghostly shadow entering a world not its own.
One black boy whimpered. The other’s teeth
chattered.
The creek abruptly twisted and presently
widened slightly. The darkness lightened.
The branches overhead parted; a glimmer of
sky showed a twinkling spray of stars fear-
fully high up.
"Thank God!” breathed Reynolds; “at
last we can see, if only in patches. This job
is getting on my nerves.”
“Clang! Clang!”
A ship’s bell tolled from the very sky. It
throbbed among the Avet tree-trunks, and Avas
thrown to the water and rip again to echo
through the trees and, whispering, die far
out at sea.
“Clang, clang!” “Clang, clang!” “Clang,
clang!” The Avhole Avorld trembled to the
vibrations.
Both blackboys tlireAv themselves face down
into the dinghy. Both white men jumped
for an oar just in the nick of time. Almost
imperceptibly the dinghy swung around.
Cursing in the quick relief after fright, the
white men kicked the terror-stricken boys.
But death itself could not have loosened their
grip of the boat’s bottom.
“No good,” panted Harris. “They’re done!
But the bell is straight ahead. I’ll pull.
Quick! You keep a bright look-out from the
stern.”
He bent to the oars. A gurgle came from
the dinghy as she shot ahead. Reynolds
clenched his hand on the tiller, peered wide-
eyed over his mate’s shoulder. A gleam of
light, real light, strayed steadily between the
branches where the sea-creek widened out
and tall, gnarled trees stood up.
Right across the creek, stretched from tree
to tree, was the white bridge of a steamer,
and along it walked, tall and alert, back-
wards and forwards, backwards and forwards,
a man in the smart uniform of an ocean
boat’s captain. The rays of two hurricane
lanterns, lashed high, gleamed on shiny but-
tons as he turned in his parade, on the
peak cap, the gold braid of his cuffs.
Spick and span, square-shouldered, well
groomed, greying A’andyck beard ! Direjctly
above the bridge a large ship’s bell Avas
lashed to a tree branch. Secured to the bridge
beneath a lamp was a fat white-painted life-
belt, and the tAvo men read in black letters
“S.S. Tait.”
In amazement the men stared hard. They
saw then that the bridge was a framework
of driftwood and Avreckage built from tree to
tree across the creek, and fastened to it a
broad sheet of canvas formed the bridge.
Close by was a whaleboat moored at stern
and bows Avith long ropes that would alloAV
the vessel to rise and fall Avith the tides.
They understood then.
Invisible, insistent hands tugged at the
dinghy. Harris mechanically jambed the
oars in the Avater to steady it.
The dinghy edged aAvay as if a great hand
clutched her keel and, laughing silently,
dragged her back. Without looking, Rey-
nolds stretched out an arm and clutched a
twisted branch.
“Harris!” The whisper Avas the voice of
a man afraid of himself. “Tell me ! What
do you see?”
Harris turned and smiled understandingly.
“It’s all right, old man,” he whispered. “Just
the same as you. I’ve just about got it
sized up. I recognise him. Captain Tersh,
of the Tait. He piled her up on a coral reef
in the Straits, just as 111 bells struck, one
night in the big king tides four years ago.
He raved he’d go down Avith his ship; but
they man-handled him into the boats. Half
the crew and passengers Avent to the locker,
though. He was drunk. Lost his ticket, of
course. I remember him Avell at the inquiry
at Thursday Island.”
Reynolds drew a long, relieved breath.
“But —but—what does this mean?”
“Looks as if lie’s gone clean mad and
thinks he’s on the bridge again—as he should
have been that night. What A you think?”
“Thought I’d gone dotty.” Reynolds whis-
pered. “But Ave.'ll soon hear his version.
Pull up, Harris, the drag has almost got
my arm pulled out.”
Harris bent to the oars. Reynolds slipped
his hold. Instantly the dinghy swung vici-
ously doAvn stream. Straining in intense
surprise, Harris forced tin; dinghy’s head
around.
"Kick up those blarsted boys,” he gasped.
“The tide’s turned! It’s almost wrenching
the oars out of my hands.”
Reynolds snatched an oar and together
they tugged the boat back towards the bridge
Before they got within hail a curious
change had come over the night-silence. There
was a whispering everywhere. Now the
whole of the water Avas humming and hissing;
the millions of tree trunks came to gurgling
life. The vast sheet of water was quivering
under the strain, it was spreading out, mov-
ing. The sea was subsiding, falling quicklv
many feet, and the waters on the land were
astrain to rush back into the bosom of the
mother.
With lungs at bursting point Reynolds
roared “Ahoy, there, ahoy!”
The figure on the bridge halted, petrified,
his eyes riveted on the struggling dinghy.
He dropped to his knees.
“It’s all right!” bawled Reynolds. “For
God’s sake keep your head. We’re friends!
Do you want to come off in the dinghy?”
Tlie man, ashen white, stared at them.
“Quick!” shouted Reynolds. “We can
hardly hold her seconds longer. Quick.
Speak!”
“I thought”—came a quavering voice. “Are
you really—l thought”
“It’s all right, Tersh,” shouted Harris.
“You remember me. Harris of Thursday
Island. We’re not ghosts! We’re pearling
off Coquette Island. Come with us to the
cutter for a spell, will you? But be quick.”
The man rose, tall, commanding. Fury
flooded his face. He clenched a fist at them.
“I thought you were they come up from
the sea,” he screamed. “Curse you! Can’t
you leave me alone even here? Go off into
the darkness and drown, you swine! Just
as I saw them drown.”
“Let her-go,” gasped Reynolds. “Try to
swing her nose around.”
Both men swung on the port oars. She
plunged half-side on into the darkness. The
rushing waters spun her nose around; she
tore through the night like a black arrow.
“Pull in the oars,” shouted Reynolds.
“They’ll be snapped. I’ll try to steer, though
I can’t see a yard ahead. If we’re dashed
against the trees, cling to the branches and
chance to seeing daylight.”
Straight down the black channel the dinghy
flew. All around and far away was one
curious wailing sob.
Falling in a circle, the waters of the island
rushed back into the sea. Dismal cries
and groans rose from a million tree trunks
as the sucking waters swirled and dragged
among them. A million drooping branches
sucked under by weight of pulling water
added their billions of cricket-like cries to
the din.
An irresistible force dragged the dinghy
side-on against the trunks. Both men flung
desperate arms around a tree.
A new note stormed into ■ the infernal
orchestra. The waters had changed direc-
tion.
“It’s all right,” shouted Harris; “a blessed
relief. The water is flowing off wherever
gravitation pulls it. Presently, as the tide
lowers, it’ll rush back into the deep channels
again and carry us out along the creek back
to the blessed sea. If we’re lucky! But
put life into those boys or we’re goners.
I’ll hold the dinghy.”
Reynolds gripped his arms around the
waist of a boy. The boy screamed.
“Billy,” said Reynolds, “I chuckem you
overboard longa debil-debil fish. What say
vou?”
The boy sobbed, clenched his teeth in the
dinghy gunnel and clawed the bottom.
“Then sit longa seat!” roared Reynolds.
“Takem oar! By-em-bye we pull out longa
cutter. S’posem you no pull I chuckem you
over! Which feller?”
The boy scrambled to his seat. Reynolds
treated his companion likewise.
For an hour they clung there, the dinghy
pressed against the trunks as by a mighty
hand. Quite suddenly the pulling waters
jarred the trunks as if in indecision. A new-
toned whine rose up among the trees. The
dinghy eased off, gathered way and shot
forward down the creek.
Harris sprang to the bows. “Make the
boys back-paddle like hell,” he shouted. “If
they can only steady her I’ll do my best to
see ahead. The thickest mass of foam is
the channel.”
Reynolds clung to the tiller. The dinghy
simply merged into the sucking stream of
the waters.
“Port!” yelled Harris. “Port! Port!”
Reynolds threw his weight against the
tiller.
Rounding the creek turn the water, impati-
ent of the restriction, screamed through the
trees as it tried to tear the jutting corner
from its path.
“Keep her off th’ trunks,” yelled Reynolds.
“We might round th’ turn.”
Their united strength held her off, and foot
by foot, greatly aided by the circling over-
flow, the dinghy rounded the turn, and, being
immediately snatched by the main course of
the current, shot straight off.
Quivering like the muscles of a terrified
horse, the tiny black shadow shot through the
churning, milky haze and over the reef edge
into the deep waters of the sea. Its speed
lessening, it slowed down a quarter-mile from
the island.
Reynolds’s big eyes smiled at Harris. “By
all the powers that be,” he said in a wonder-
ing voice, “but this little old world of ours
holds many surprises. And life, by God, life
is good!”
* * * *
Two. days later, from the cutter's deck,
they stared at a forlorn something drifting
towards them with the current. “Do you
know,” said Harris quietly, “I don’t quite
sense what it is—yet. But—do you remem-
ber that night? The tide water was right
up to the bottom of the bridge. Last night saw
the full height of the king tides, the anniver-
sary, as it happens, of the night the Tait
went down. Last night's tide waters rose
many feet higher than the night we were
there. I wonder —I wonder if the old fool
would stay on that flimsy bridge and imagine
he was going down with his boat. That
water would tear his bridge away as if it
was a straw.”
Reynolds turned towards the dinghy.
“We’ll see what it is,” he said.
"It’’ was a white-painted lifebelt carrvin"
in bold black letters "S.S. Tait.”

Long, Long Ago.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THERE was a brown pathos in little
Dolly Hogg’s elfin, freckled face
which appealed to the old nun. There
was a hardness about the tiny hands which,
when her own soft, Avhite hands touched
them, filled her with pity. Dolly had three
cows to milk before she came to school, and
the three cows helped to pay her schooling
fees—a shilling a week —at the convent.
Dolly Avas not a “Caffolie,” but sometimes
she helped to gather the lilies from the con-
vent garden for the white altar, and more
than once she had, with the other children,
cleaned the candlesticks just outside the
church side-door.
All Dolly’s cousins Avere “Caffolics,” and
Dolly folloAved their devotions in awe, always
staying to prayers, secretly blessing herself
Avheu they blessed themselves, never to be
mocked, always to be nodded at or smiled
at in approval. Her cousins milked cows,
too, and the cows were a bigger bond than
the Church.
So Avlien Dolly was instructed in the five-
finger exercise by old Sister Mary Cath-
erine she had the feeling that a saint Avas
instructing her child fingers—as, of course,
a saint Avas. The old nun was nearer ninety
than eighty, and if so many years of self-
sacrifice and self-denial do not make a saint,
nothing does. But even saints grow old,
and Dolly’s saint was grey with age. She
was so old now that she could not direct
Dolly’s music-lesson without falling to sleep.
When she did this Dolly stopped her music,
and, taking her doll from her schoolbag,
played quietly with it, putting the little pink-
faced thing on the piano music-stand. But
she was always too quick for her teacher.
She hid it at once when the tired old eyes
opened, and gently directed the pupil’s fingers.
“A hard little hand for such a good little
girl,” Sister Mary Catherine said once, re-
taining Dolly’s small hand in her Avarm, soft
one. “What makes a little girl’s hand as
hard as this?” Very shyly, almost breath-
lessly, Dolly replied, “Milking.” And from
that moment there Avas an understanding
between the nun and the little girl which
was stronger than the saints themselves.
“There’s a poley cow will come up out of
the bog one night,” Sister Mary Catherine
said to Dolly, “and all the coavs of the world
will follow it.”
Then she went to sleep, and Dolly played
her five-finger exercise; then “Nelly Biy,”
then the “Keel Row,” then “Long, Long
Ago,” Avliicli wuis her new piece, but she
stopped short at the second line. Dolly never
could master the bass notes of the tune, and
here Sister Mary Catherine would usually
awaken and play the notes so that the old
saint and the little child made a duet of it.
Sometimes, when Dolly’s playing suddenly
ceased, which meant that Dolly was playing
with her doll, young Sister Mary Magdalene,
Avhose crucifix was always falling from her
belt and clicking against her beads, would
come from the theory class next door with
a gentle rustle of robes and beads and look
Avistfully at the sleeping Sister Mary Cath-
erine. Then she would say quietly to Dolly,
“Now r , be a good girl, Dolly, and try to play
your piece well.”
One day the Mother Superior came in sud-
denly and waked Sister Mary Catherine.
Mother Superior’s face was l very white when
she shook the old nun; and when the tired,
faded eyes opened, instead of being angry
the Reverend Mother smiled, just as Dolly
might smile, and nodded and went away.
But Sister Mary Catherine sat up straight
and said to Dolly: “Always touch my nose
when you hear footsteps, Dolly. That will
waken me.”
So, when Sister Mary Catherine went to
sleep, and Dolly’s music stopped, the child
would listen for the convent sounds, and if
she heard the rustle of beads or the gliding
sound of nuns’ shoes on the bare boards with-
out, she would very tenderly and Avitli great
reverence draw the brown tip of her finger

along the tip of Sister Mary Catherine’s nose.
Then Sister Mary Catherine would give a
little jerk, first of her body, then of her
head, then she would smile at Dolly, nod
gently and the music would begin again.
“Long, long ago! Yes, it's long, long ago!”
The footsteps would stop at the little dark
room, wherein the young child and the old
nun sat, and then glide away.
Dolly’s home was a rough farm, three
miles from the convent; and when Dolly's
parents had no shillings for the schooling of
Dolly and her sister, the children took fresh
butter and fresh eggs and fresh vegetables
to the convent, and that did in exchange.
Dolly’s sister learned painting and fancy
work. She could play “There is a Green
Hill” on her violin. Young Sister Mary
Magdalene taught her that. But Dolly had
no brains; she could do none of these things.
That is why she learned music from old
Sister Mary Catherine. Of all the children
Dolly Avas the most hopeless. The Reverend
Mother said her herring-bone stitches on her
sampler, were like crow’s feet. She was often
puzzled as to which was her right and which
her left hand. She always had to write in
the air wdien asked Avliicli Avas her right hand.
Sister Mary Magdalene said it was perhaps
the three cows and the three miles of walk-
ing that made Dolly so dull. But Sister
Mary Catherine understood, though she kueAV
nothing of the doll in Dolly’s schoolbag, nor
of Dolly’s secret little boAvings and bless-
ings in between the music days when she
came and struggled Avitli the bass notes of
“Long, Long Ago.”
The Reverend Mother, who kneAv the
struggle that those at the little farm Avere
making for Dolly’s education, worried over
the child. The convent meant civilisation.
In the little town to which every morning,
after she had helped to milk the cows, Dolly
delivered milk, and sometimes butter, eggs
and vegetables, it stood for all that was cul-
tured, desirable and sweet outside pigs and
cows and horses. It did not stand for prayer
so much as music, art and song, the piano-
forte, the violin, the harp, the palette, the
brush and paint-tube, the ballad, operatic
air and cantata. These were the things
which it brought with it. and these were
the things about which little Dolly Hogg
knew nothing. To her the convent meant
old Sister Mary Catherine sleeping by the
piano, young Sister Mary Magdalene walk-
ing hurriedly with clicking crucifix, Rever-
end Mother w r ith sliding of soft feet, rustle
of beads and flowing robes. It also meant

windows of figured saints, red and yellow
and brown, close air, darkness, lilies, the
faint whisper of prayer, and children—hun-
dreds of children, always marching before
the blue statue of Our Lady, which stood in
a niche in the school hall. Once Dolly had
come to school early, and had seen her cousin
Florence dusting the statue gravely, and an-
other day someone left a feather-duster lean-
ing against it. That had been a great day
for Dolly, because she had whispered the
fact to her cousin, and her cousin had said
breathlessly and in awe, “Go and get it.”
Dolly was so perilously near the statue
she almost touched it, felt the blue robes en-
fold her own little soul for a moment, and
then blow back into place. She returned to
Iter seat quietly, almost, transfigured. But
when she looked up at. the blue statue it was
still there unmoved. The calm mother-eyes,
the happy motlier-smile had not altered. The
infant in her arms had not fallen. Dolly was
always afraid it might fall. Our Lady seemed
sometimes so interested in the children work-
ing sums and reading in the school-room be-
low her, and her child was held only upon
one arm; the other stretched out a little
towards Dolly and Florence, and the bowed
heads of the hundreds of little girls and big
girls beneath her.
Sometimes, when the window near the
statue was opened in sunny, blue mornings,
Dolly could see the cross of the church just
without; and the sunlight swam like a sea
of fire and flowering air between them —•
flowering because little Dolly saw the red
and yellow roses and flowers that colored some
of the church windows in place of saints
take wing and fill all the pauses ofl .space, so
that the air appeared a garden through which
Our Lady, all in blue, her pink child and
the gold and silver and rose saints moved
continually.
There were times when she herself, old
Sister Mary Catherine, the Mother Superior
and old Father Flaherty, who was so tot-
tering and blind now that he could not leave
his garden, her cousins and all the children
became mixed up in the air with the roses
and saints and Our Lady. But young Sister
Magdalene always brought Dolly back from
that place.
“Dolly Ilogg, have you finished your
sums ?”
“No, Sister.”
“Then come here. Oh, Dolly! Dolly!
Six and eight do not make fifteen!”
And Sister Magdalene would shake her
head sorrowfully, for she, too, knew of the
struggle that was going on among pigs and
hens and cows to keep Dolly at the convent.
In the morning she milked her three cows
by lantern-light. She drove with her brothers
to town, and sleepily poured the milk into
cans hanging on picket-gates or jugs stand-
ing at closed doors. Then she drove home
and sleepily cleaned the cans, and began to
walk along the white, dusty road, three miles
to town again, then up the convent hill, late,
very late —nearly ten o’clock —stopping for
a moment to peep into Father Flaherty’s
garden to listen to his pigeons cooing, to
hear the tap of his cane, to see between
the tangle of green the twinkle of pink and
white geraniums; then across the road, to the
church gates, sleepily passing, entering by
the school gate. The hum of voices; some-
one singing ABC; the flickering figures
of saints! Up, up the long stairs; and, at
the end, Our Lady, always smiling, always
waiting with her comforting eyes.
“Dolly Hogg late again! Oh, Dolly, go
out and dust your boots.”
Three o’clock —yawning, sleepy. “Dollj
Hogg, isn’t it your music hour?”
“Yes,. Sister Mary Magdalene.”
“Run along, then.”
Battered music-case, torn Homey’s, broken
little boots crossing the asphalt; the swing-
door to the convent; the quiet bees among
the lilies; the content of prayer; the Rever-
end Mother.
“Well, Dolly Hogg, can you play ‘Long,
Long Ago’ yet?”
Shy eyes, hung head. “Nearly.”
“I wonder now. Come along with me.”
Click of beads; rustle of robes; slip, slip
of quiet feet. Old Mary in the kitchen,
fat and rosy and freckled and sunny.
“Hello, little ‘Long, Long Ago’!”
Dolly hung her head and rubbe.d her little
chin sensitively from side to side on her
chest.' Everyone in the world seemed to
know that she could not play “Long, Long
Ago” yet.
The Mother Superior’s soft hand on her
tousled head. Mary, smiling, hands white
with flour. The stove red with life. Crackle
of sweet-smelling wood. The Reverend
Mother’s voice: “Can you find a tart for
her. Mary?”
The Reverend Mother herself handing the
plate to her—two apricot-tarts on a brown-
flowered plate. Dolly eating from the hands
of saints. Every crumb gone.
“Good-bye, Mary.”
“Good-bye, Dolly Hogg. Wipe your boots
on the mat.”
Scrape of her broken boots along the
darkening passage. Sister Mary Catherine
sound asleep.
Dolly took her seat by the piano noise-
lessly. The tarts had kept her late. She
opened her battered music-case, noiselessly
took out her Hemy’s, flung back the tattered
tln*eads of her hair, and almost as silently
as if she had been a phantom opened her
schoolbag.
Sister Mary Catherine did not waken. No
sound of the Reverend Mother’s footsteps,
no rustle of beads, no clicking of
crucifix; bees among the lilies softly dron-
ing ; the far-away clatter of Mary in the
kitchen; darkness in the little music-room;
the breathlessness of quiet, cloistered content.
Dolly’s schoolbag was of hessian. It
opened soundlessly, and from the mysterious
depths of it Dolly drew out a strange object.
A savage child in a dim island long, long
ago might have bowed down to just such an
object. It was a green stick with a nobby
end and a hard little knotty head. About
the stick was wrapped a piece of gay green
silk.
The child’s play was grave. She sat the
object on the music-stand, and then she
leaned towards it and took it tenderly down,
kissed it, held it to her little heart, and put
it back again. Then she grasped it with a
little, wild, hungry movement, and held it
closely in her arms. She was about to put
it back on the stand when her little hands
trembled, and quickly she hid it behind her
back. Sister Catherine was awake. Sister
Catherine had seen her!
Dolly turned her strange little eyes round
and met those of the old nun.
“What is that you have, Dolly?” White
hands folded in her lap, her chin resting
upon her cliin-band. Sister Catherine waited.
The child flushed scarlet. She made a
little wriggling motion trying to get the
object back into her bag. But she could not.
She turned again. She could no longer hide
her secret, and with a little, frightened look
she whispered: “It’s a doll.” Then she drew
it round and held it up in a mixture of pride
and anxiety.
Sister Catherine would take it from her.
It was wicked to bring a doll into school—
a doll into the convent! Sister would give
it to Mary to burn in the fire —a doll in the
music-room!
But Sister Catherine only smiled. _ Then
she chuckled softly. Deep down in her
throat somewhere the chuckle lived. It was
THE GREATER ACHIEVEMENT.
SURGEON: “I have just performed a wonder-
ful operation—I took a lung out of a
man.”
NURSE: “ Pooh — that's nothing! I’ve taken
the hearts out of ten!”
young and fresh —a wonderful sound of morn-
ing dew, fresh roses and youth. Her shoul-
ders heaved a little. She stretched out her
hand and took the doll.
“And what do.you call her?” she said.
Dolly hung her head. “Cathleen,” she
said. She pronounced it “Caffaleen.”
“Cathleen?” smiled Sister Mary Catherine.
(She pronounced it “Cackaleen.”)
“Well, now! Well, now!” She laughed
again and kept the doll on her lap. “Go on
with your music, Dolly. Scales three times
each.”
Dolly played her scales and then her
pieces.
Twice the rustle of robes, twice her elfin
finger flicked Sister Catherine’s nose. Twice
while the nun slept Dolly tried to take her
doll away. In vain. The nun’s fingers held
it.
Dolly began to know fear. She had
searched all the bush for Caffaleen. Caffa-
leen was her pride. She had brought her to
school that morning because Caffaleen had
been good—the best of all her children, and
down in the green gully beyond the farm
Dolly had fifty children, each one a stick
to adult eyes, but to Dolly’s eyes real beings.
Every one she loved. Every one she knew
and called by name. Every one she took to
school in turn as it "was good. These were
the secret children —the little bush ones her
tiny mother-heart watched over and tended
secretly. Once she used to teach and scold
them all in the green paddock near the stock-
yard, but her mother, knowing nothing of
their connection w-ith Dolly, had seen the
sticks—it was washing-day, and Dolly’s
stick-children were all naked—and had taken
them in and burnt them, leaving their little
lonely wisps of clothing, colored rags and
silks and cashmere, scattered about on grass
and bush. Dolly had to move her family
into the gully after that, and it was from
the gully she had brought Caffaleen.'
Over and over again Dolly’s little fingers
played the tune, and Sister Catherine slept
on, and Caffaleen lay in her lap.
Rustle of beads, sounds of sliding shoes.
Dolly put up a little finger-tip and touched
Sister Catherine’s nose. Sister Catherine
did not ierk her head. She did not open her
eyes. Rustle of beads, nearer sounds of
sliding shoes.
Again, again, fearfully now. Dolly touched
the nose. The head did not jerk. There
was no movement of any kind. But steps
nearer, nearer.
“Sister ! Sister Catherine, wake up ! Here’s
the Reverend Mother! Sister ! Sister !”
No sound. Nothing stirred.
Rustle of beads, clicking of crucifix. The
Reverend Mother’s voice, Mary’s voice, young
Sister Magdalene’s voice, hushed, horrified;
sweet, stinging, sudden, terrible.
“Sister Catherine ! Sister Catherine ! Dear
Sister, what is the matter?”
Dolly put out her little hand and tried
to draw Caffaleen away. But the old nun’s
fingers were closed tightly around it.
Rustle of beads, clicking of crucifix: agi-
tated breathing, flicker of figures, rustle of
robes. Yet Sister Catherine slept on.
“Run away, Dolly! Run away home.”
“Caffaleen, my dolly. Sister, please may
I have Caffaleen?”
Flicker of figures, clicking of crucifix,
rustle of beads, murmur of sudden prayer.
“Run home, Dolly Hogg.”
Old Sister Catherine did not move. Caffa-
leen remained in her lap.
Dolly waited alone a long time in the
passage, a long time in the dining-room.
School was out. The bees were silent among
the lilies. Then she crept silently round to the
convent door and scratched timidly upon it.
“Sister, she said in a whisper.
“You have forgotten to give me back my
dolly! Sister!” ;
Cloistered peace, sounds of praying, dark-
ness. stillness!
“Sister! Sister ! Sister Catherine, the sun
is going down.”
She beat her little fist upon the door now.
Dusk was awakening. Milking time would
soon be past. The boys would be milking
now. Three miles to walk home! Three
miles without Caffaleen. Caffaleen left in
the convent. Caffaleen burnt. Caffaleen!
Caffaleen!
“Sister! Sister! Sister Catherine ! You’ve
forgotten to give me back my dolly.”
Our Lady’s robe turned grey in the sky
and Dolly left the convent garden and passed
bv the church —passed by the weedy garden
of the old priest. A hell began to toll
slowly, solemnly.
ZORA CROSS.


The Women of the Glory.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
THERE is a glorious company that moves
Through perfumed ways beneath the
starry lights
To cries of little bells, beat of white hooves
And dulcet music gathering all delights
In the clear calling of a silvern flute
That pulses always at the heart of spring.
Before the living wonder, time is mute,
Its ages lost in sweet remembering.
Oh, little head in Mitylene bowed
Over the reed pen and the crinkled script!
The school is out, the market-place is loud,
The summer passes and the vines are stript
Of dusty purple; but the Asian air
Creeps through the myrtles to the lattice
bars,
And, having fondled once your singing hair,
Cries, “Sappho ! Sappho ! Sappho !” to
the stars.
There was a maid in warm green Galilee
Whose shapely shoulders held the pitcher
high
On the white path beneath the olive tree
When all the dreams of Israel, like a sigh,
Moved in its ancient branches. Brazen power
Of Rome’s lost legions on the highways
trod;
But Nazareth hid the wonder of that flower—
Mary, the sweetheart of eternal God!
The broken horsehair plumes are in the dust.
Bronze shield and naked thigh, the foemen
meet
In sweat and blood, while the loud chariot
thrust
Drives in the close-wedged phalanx and
the feet
Of snorting horses urge the screaming death.
Oh, torch of doom upon the walls above!
Helen’s red hair that felt the tempest’s
breath
Is braided still for life or loose for love.
Queen of the lavender west, Maeve of the
spears!
Maeve, beautiful as rest, amid her bees!
Maeve of the challenge and the ready tears,
Maeve of what love beneath what age-old
, trees!
Her court was like the shimmer of green
silk;
And still down valleys shaded with the past
She rides her stallion, white as moony milk—
The spirit of an age too fine to last.
I have seen all these shining women pass
On quiet mornings full of misty light,
Making no shadow on the whispering grass.
And I have seen them, like a vision white
Of infinite glory, move with flags unfurled
Through the high noon, while golden trum-
pets cried
From all man’s lips the homage of the world
To her whose beauty was the whole world’s
bride.
And, as I gazed and worshipped, in their
eyes
A soft look grew, familiar warm and kind,
Till, with a sudden ecstasy grown wise,
My heart was open that before was blind.
And this sweet thing into my soul I drew,
Like some new music from an old known
star:
The women of the glory all were you,
Who taught me all the best that women
are.

The Third Canvasser.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
IN a shaded corner of the lawn that fronted
the big, rambling house, Mrs. Matson
sat listlessly, trying to concentrate on
the movements of the motor-cars and trams
that passed. In a vague way she remem-
bered how she had resented their coming in
the years that were no more. At first she
SHE WOULDN’T HAVE THOUGHT OF
IT OTHERWISE.
HUBBY : “ What do you mean—hissing a per-
fect stranger!”
WIFEY: “ Goodness , I thought you knew
him!”
had vowed to put a hedge between herself
and their clamor; but she had never done
that. She had grown to accept them first
as conveniences, and then as comforts, even
as companions. With a tram passing the
door every fifteen minutes, she could call
frequently on friends whom previously she
had seen only at long intervals; and, of
course, they could call upon her. People
were always waving to her from the cars
that passed the house, and her early resent-
ment had long since been supplanted by
pleased tolerance.
The years had brought wonderful changes
in many directions, but some things re-
mained constant. The even slope that ran
down to the front fence still drew after it
the full acre of lawn that was like emerald
plush. The orderly flower-beds still held
the pleasing combinations of form and color
that were the products of many years of nn-
ceasing care, and the sparrows still searched
meticulously for food in the squares and
circles of freshly-spaded earth.
Yes, changes came; and now the great
change was coming to her. The great
change! She must not think of that, though;
and yet she could hardly help thinking of it.
This was the first day she had been allowed
to sit out of doors, and she fondly hoped
that the clear freshness of the Spring after-
noon would help to melt the weight that
pressed so heavily on her consciousness. At
the far end of the garden, Arthur, her son,
and his wife, Jean, were wandering about sur-
veying present growths and making plans for
future ones. Idly she watched them, won-
dering whether they knew she had overheard
the doctor’s parting words to Arthur yester-
day. “It may come in Mrs. Matson’s
case at any moment,” he had said. “I can-
not give hope for longer than a month at
the very outside; it may even come to-
morrow.” Well, she had heard —and she
was afraid. Last night Arthur had writ-
ten several letters, and, though she had
seemed to be engrossed in her magazine, she
knew exactly what he had written, and
OUR NEW BINDER.
YOUNG JOE : “Hey, Dad, I found them
’arrers we lost last so win’!”
where the missives were being directed. Mrs.
Matson’s heart yearned unspeakably for her
absent children; and yet with all the com-
fort their presence would bring, there was
one terror it could not banish —the moment
of death.
She, dreaded that moment with an almost
uncontrollable sense of fear. The thought
of it had wakened her a half-dozen times
throughout the night, gasping, choking,
sticky-wet. She feared it might come in
those hours of darkness when she was alone
and too weak to cry out. In all her vigor-
ous young womanhood, in all the various
phases of her life, she had not previously
known a terror like this. It pressed upon
her, like an actual weight, and it was with
her day and night. It was characteristic
of her that she never spoke of this horror
to her children. The life-long habit of spar-
ing her offspring unnecessary suffering still
persisted; it was the final manifestation of
her maternal self-sacrifice.
Her sickness had left her pale and wan, but
the impression she gave, as always, was of a
sweet-faced old woman, whose features had
never quite lost their attractive lines, and
whose silvery hair still showed, parted and
waved over the temples, in youthful abund-
ance. From under her skirt the unworn
shoes protruded, flat-lieeled and square-toed;
and on her left hand, claw-like and freckled,
the tight wedding-ring puffed the flesh in
little mounds.
“The roses are doing splendidly, Mother,”
called Arthur from the near distance. Mrs.
Matson’s reply was a feeble wave of her
hand. She did not speak, as it required too
much of an effort to project her voice across
the little space that, intervened. She watched
Arthur return to his -wife’s side, and stand
talking earnestly for a few minutes. She
knew they were talking about her, and she
guessed what they were saying; but she did
not care. Shifting her gaze, she looked out
over the street to where the Fetherstone
orchard showed—an enormous plane of blos-
som about which the air seemed to hold a
rosy glow. Its perfume came to her on
little breezes that were warmer than the air
itself. She tried to order her thoughts, but
in spite of all she could do the horror seeped
back again, and the burden grew still
heavier.
“Those canvassers are back again,
Mother.” Arthur was leaning over the gate
and looking up the street. “They’ll be here
to-day. I suppose you’ll sign their petition?”
Again she nodded, without answering,
For days the district had been systemati-
cally canvassed in the interests of some civic
matter, and the Matson house had already
been visited twice. She had been sick,
though, and was unable to see the agents.
She could see them now, some distance down
the hill, and followed their work with some-
thing approaching interest. There were two
of them —no, three that she could count. She
Avas able to concentrate on their movements
because they seemed so forceful and full of
life. That is, two of them did. The actions
of these two seemed to denote cheery, pur-
poseful character. They walked into the
houses with the superb effrontery and opti-
mism of youth. The third was of a differ-
ent type. In the first place he was a mere
boy, and obviously shy. He treated his
work as though it was very hard. He would
walk up and down in front of a house for
a long time, not even looking at it directly,
but peering sideways. Sometimes he would
not go in at all, but would pass along to the
next place. Sometimes, too, he would enter
a gate, and when no more than a few steps
from the door would retreat precipitately as
though his courage had suddenly deserted
him. Once outside on the pathway he would
stand dejected, then suddenly square his
shoulders as tlio gh steeling himself to further
effort. Again he would disappear and state
his case to the householder, only to fail and
suffer a recurrence of his misery that was so
clearly discernible in every drooping line of
his body.
Mrs. Matson felt a great wave of sympathy
for the unknown boy who was so obviously
unfitted for the task he had undertaken. He
was not the type for that kind of effort. In
some ways lie reminded her of Rupert.
Rupert! Must she leave Rupert behind, too,
or would she find him there? No, she must
not think of that; she must not! She closed
her eyes to the world about her, and again
her terror shut out all other conscious im-
pressions.
When she looked up again Arthur was
standing beside her.
“The old place is looking splendid this
year, Mother,” he said.
“Yes,” she answered with an effort. “The
rain was such a blessing, wasn’t it? Per-
haps we’ll have settled weather now.”
“I hope so,” he answered, “because I’ll be
home for the greater part of a month, I think.
A holiday will do me the world of good, and
I have made arrangements to stay with you
instead of going away.”
“I’m glad, Arthur, very glad, my son.”
“The girls are coming by the late train
this afternoon, too,” he went on. “Just
think of it, mother! If only Tom could
get here we would have a complete family
reunion.”
“You’re forgetting Rupert, Arthur,” she
interpolated. “Don't forget him. I never
do.”
Rupert was Mrs. Matson’s youngest son.
Ten years before, when he was only seven-
teen, he had gone to sea, and his ship, the
Norwood Lass, had called at Liverpool.
Rupert had gone ashore, and he had never
returned. In the face of all contrary opinion,
Mrs. Matson had never lost faith that he
would return to her. Through all those
years her heart had fluttered whenever
strange footfalls had sounded on the gravel
path that led to the front door.
“I’m always expecting him, Arthur,” she
went on faintly; “I have never ceased to
hope, you know.”
“It would be a wonderful thing if he did
return,” said her son, with the hint of a
shadow in his eyes. He went on to talk
about his and Jean’s plans for the future.
They were going to perform winders in the
garden, altering there and extending here,
and as she listened carefully Mrs. Matson
gave gentle approval; but, inside, she was
all torn and bleeding again. Arthur’s seem-
ing indifference to Rupert’s whereabouts, his
evident assurance that his younger brother
would never return, hurt her unspeakably.
"With- passionate fondness she examined the
picture that had hung, vividly colored, in
the gallery of her mind. It was curious
that Rupert had been the wanderer of the
family. She would have expected it sooner
of either of the others. Still, she reflected,
the more restless spirits are often housed by
the most unlikely bodies.
She looked up into the sky where clouds
were fraying at the edges and melting even
as she watched. Birds flew in and out of
the Fetherstone orchard, and a constant
shower of pink petals sifted to the green.
With a squeaking of brakes a big car drew
up at the kerb outside the great, white house
opposite. _ Why, it was Dr. Brown’s car!
“There’s the doctor, mother,” said Arthur.
“I forgot to tell you that Mrs. Fetherstone
is having a hard time of it. Dr. Brown
was there twice through the night. I asked
Jean to go across and see if there u r as any-
thing she could do. The nurse said she
would raise that big curtain a little as soon
as the baby was born. You mustn't let it
worry you, though, mother.”
“At my time of life you grow to realise
that births are happy things, Arthur. Only
death is terrifying and unhappy.”
“There are those two canvassers again,”
he changed the subject abruptly, a nervous
furrow playing on his brow. “I expect they
will be here soon now.”
“Two, did you say? Why, Arthur, there
are three. There’s' one you probably didn’t
notice —he doesn’t seem to be very success-
ful. See, there he is now.”
The furrow on the son’s brow deepened,
and he stole an uneasy glance at the placid
old figure in the invalid-chair.
“Yes, mother, I can see him now,” he an-
swered slowly; but his voice was flat, wor-
ried. Again he joined his wife and talked
with her earnestly; and again Mrs. Matson
knew what they were talking about. With
a sudden, sharp sense of terror she won-
dered whether her other children would be
too late. She put the thought aside despe-
rately, and foi-ced herself +o look at the
Fetherstone house again. Dr. Brown was
still inside; perhaps he was going to stay
this time. There were signs of activity
about; windows opened, doors shut. The
servant who had been sweeping the front
verandah disappeared abruptly as though in
answer to a sudden call. Anew baby ! Only
a mother could understand how wonderful
it all was. Why, to a mother, that moment
of birth A sudden bitter pang tore her.
The moment of birth? The moment of death !
A brief respite followed that spasm of
terror. Looking away from the Fetherstone
house she saw the third canvasser again. He
had just emerged from the place next door,
and had obviously again been unsuccessful,
for he drooped with greater dejection than
ever. Outside the Fetherstone place be
stopped, and studied the big. rambling build-
ing with liis strange, furtive srlanco. as
though trving to remember something. Then,
swift and he slipped through the
entrance. The, gate swung to, concealing
him temporarily.
“Are you all right, Mother?” It was Jean
this time—Jean, whose wholesome matronly
figure and strong-looking teeth were the. most
striking features of a personality that simply
radiated health and competence. “These
days are so treacherous, you know,” she went
on. “Isn’t it nice that Arthur and the girls
will be with us this summer? I hope they
won’t think I’ve made too many changes
in the old place.”
“I know they’ll be pleased, dear,” answered
Mrs. Matson. “It’s wonderful what you’ve
been able to do in such a little while.”
The younger woman still fingered the
soft, white shawl that was draped about the
invalid’s shoulders. “Are you sure you’re
all right, Mother dear?” —again that poorly
concealed note of anxiety that had been in
her son’s voice a few minutes earlier.
“Yes, Jean, I’m feeling splendid. Why
not when the sun is so glorious?”
Mrs. Matson’s preoccupied gaze followed
her daughter-in-law's return to Arthur’s side.
Idly she watched them kneel together before
a bed of lilies and cull out some of the
dead leaves. Death was there, too, then,
even amongst the pulsating riot of living
color.
The Fetherstone house was very quiet now.
Once Mrs. Matson saw a nurse pass the
window swiftly. Outside amongst the apple-
blossoms the air still whirled with a minia-
ture rose-tinted snowstorm. The sun rose
higher and higher in the sky, where the
clouds had thinned now to such an extent
that they were mere gossamer strips filming
the deep azure void. The little warm breezes
were even more saturated with perfume and
the heavy smell ot damp earth from the
freshly-spaded flower-beds. She heard a
sharp cry from Arthur, and saw him hurry-
ing across the lawn towards her. Why was
he so upset? She smiled at the idea of his
worrying on her account, and her smile
caught, crystallised into sudden violent con-
traction. The moment of death !
Everything assumed a much clearer identity
now. The canvassers were drawing closer,
and she could see the third man emerging
from the Fetherstone house, every line of him
denoting further failure. He hadn’t suc-
ceeded anywhere, Mrs. Matson concluded. He
shouldn’t have tried to do this sort of thing,
as he wasn’t the type of man required. She
hoped he would come to her place, for he
would get three signatures without question.
She shut her eyes again; everything
seemed so intensely clear that she was puzzled
by her new-found surroundings. Her head,
resting sideways on her shoulder, had ceased
to throb, and she felt much stronger in
every way.
Presently the gate clicked, opened.
Mrs. Matson glanced up expectantly. As
she had hoped, it was the third canvasser.
Although she could not see his face, she
sensed a great change in his demeanor. He
bad stopped just inside the gate and stood
there momentarily, beautiful as a piece of
carved ivory in that dazzling brilliance, and
was looking up towmrds the house. As she
watched, the habitual dejection seemed to
pour out of him, and his slight frame seemed
to expand with a sudden influx of mighty
hope. She turned to call Arthur, but he
was nowhere to be seen. When she faced
about again, the newcomer was standing
A SURE THING.
CLOCLO (as parson approaches): “Bet you
he’ll ash you for something for the
plate.”
SPORTING UNCLE: “Well, I suppose if he
puts his money on. my little hay it’s as
good as any!”
there, quiet and still, looking at her in-
tently, with a little smile on his lips. Mrs.
Matson returned his scrutiny, and in that
brief moment the torturing weight on her
conscience suddenly melted away.
“Rupert!” she called softly at last. “You’ve
come back to me !”
“Yes, Mother,” he answered; “I’ve been
a long time coming for you, but I’m here at
last. I must go soon, though; but you will
be coming with me this time.”
Mrs. Matson clasped her hands ecstatically
“Oh, yes! Please take me, Rupert. Don’t
leave me again.”
“We’d better go now, Mother,” he told
her; and she saw he was still smiling. Mrs.
Matson rose, and took a step forward. Not
even in her youthful days had she known
such lightness as this; her feet did not even
disturb the grass-blades!
“Rupert, take me away quickly! I’m
dying, son, and I’m afraid. Do please save
me from the moment of”— And then as
understanding came she gasped, wonderingly'•
“Dear God, if I had only known it was so
beautiful!”
“It's always like this, Mother.” Rupert
moved towards her and together they moved
out through the gate, and passed down the
street. Passing the Fetherstone house, Mrs.
Matson saw that the nurse had gone to the
window and was raising the big curtain
Arthur had mentioned.
Something impelled her to look back at
her own home. There, in the shadowed corner
of the lawn, Arthur and Jean with tear-
stained faces were bending over a very old
lady whose peaceful white face had sagged
sideways upon her shoulder.

The Rouge Pot.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Rouge 2500 years old has been discovered.”
THERE came a peach-cheeked girl from
Samarkand
Sc nted with buddings of the summer
vale,
Trussed as a lade of purchase on the back
Of the lean yellow camel. She grew pale
Pent in the Sultan’s rooms, she who had
known
The dew at morning in the rose new-blown,
The marble courtyards where the blossoms
lie
In packs of fragrance, where the wild bird
calls
To the blue hills. All this her kingdom was.
And now she languished behind stubborn
walls.
Bright with enamels a bird's cage may lie
Making a prison under the clear sky.
Angry, the Sultan bit his hanging lip,
Scanned her in wrath, this riddle from
afar.
He bade his craftsmen take a lotus flower
And beat from gold its semblance, to a
jar
To store the color nature had denied
In these hot, twilight chambers to his bride.
Turning from him, she softly laughed and
then
Flung herself down upon the bridal bed;
And when they lifted her the dumb slaves
found
The linen on her heart was moist and red,
The dagger in her bosom deep and fast.
Neglected on the floor the jar was cast.
The wrinkled hags guarding the harem
crouched
Low in their mattresses. The bride, they
said,
Had mocked the ruddy pigments—-cried
aloud
She knew a way to make all paleness red.
A star among the black braids of her
hair.
Silver on midnights, hid a dagger there.
The Sultan had no heed of women dead.
He called to him a favorite dancing girl,
Placed in her hands the lotus jar of rouge,
Rich with the emerald, lovely with the
pearl;
The clicking of her anklets and her breath,
More sweet than cinnamons, could banish
death!
Slender and young, but in her triumph pale,
She dipped her hennaed fingers in the cup
To make her mouth as red as flowers are
That, seeing it, the Royal Bee should sup.
She hung a flaming blossom on her breast;
Her ripe uplifted mouth did all the rest.
Her Persian lover, golden as the sun,
Stole to the palace on a sultry night
When storm was in the hills. Ere he re-
turned,
Despite the jar of rouge, the girl was
white.
The Sultan, robbed of comfort, fiercely swore
The lotus jar should leave her nevermore.
They buried it within her blue-tiled tomb.
But robbers came there after many years
And broke the stone and prised the burial
chest.
The greed of gain outpacing all their
fears,
They saw the crusted jewels and the gold
And sought the hovel of a miser old.
The miser had a wife, full-bosomed, young;
The little blood he had was hers to spill.
So much he doted. When she saw the jar
To have it for her own became her will;
She locked her arm about his sallow throat,
And coaxed him with her warmth. When
old men dote
NO DIFFICULTY.
JINKS ( going in): “Pardon me, hut do you
know if I can get a bite at this hotel?”
BINKS (coming out): “Certain. I slept
here last night and got several.”
The devil laughs. Impotently he cried
He had no money for such fancies: then
She whispered in his ear (let serpents loose)
That there are ways and also younger
men.
Weeping he paid his cherished bits of gold;
The robbers haggled, but the jar was sold.
She slept with it beside her hollowed arm;
And in the night her sleepless husband rose
xlnd grieved about it. So much treasure
spilled!
He crooked his frenzied fingers—just sup-
pose
The Sultan should buy this for some new
bride
’Twould fill his coffers! At the dawn she
died;
For old men’s hands, gone mad for money,
sting.
In death she was not beautiful. But he
Lost his last wit; and clutching at her breast
Bade her again to rise his love to be.
Dying himself, he chattered o’er her bed
And from the tlirice-cursed pot made her
cheeks red.
ONE ALL ROUND.
MRS. TREGILGAS (to little daughter helping herself to a second jam-tart at Sunday-after-
noon tea) : “Put that hack, ’Lezbeth Jane; you’ve ’ad yours!”
xl sweeper found them. So the jar went on
Hidden for months among a pile of rags,
Sold for a song. It jolted o’er the sands
Against the baubles in a pedlar’s bags.
A khamsin caught him in a desert place
And piled the sands of centuries o’er his face
And buried him and all his baggage there.
The jackal sniffed about his secret bed,
The tawny lion prowled. Tall, swarthy men
Out of Arabia sang above his head;
But their swift racing camels noiselessly
Fled to the coast and let the sleeper be.
Then came a wind to raise the sand again.
Stirred by some meddling djinn, it blew
all bare
The trader’s bones. A donkey train jogged by,
Bearing rich merchandise; and still more
rare
Was the gold lotus jar the travellers found
Like a strange lily ’ springing from the
ground.
They took it. to the city, quarrelling
x\nd casting lots, until to one it fell
Who had a maid at home soon to be wed:
And thus it passed, with many a tinkling
bell
Into the grey horizons, there to prove
A talisman to keep a husband’s love.
Two thousand years! What little hands
have crept
Into its carmines! What dark, anxious
eyes
Have sought the first fine wrinkle on the
skin,
Showing the path where lover’s ardor dies,
Needing the spur to prick it warm again—-
Poor vanity that is not only vain!
What frightened women with a secret sin
Have begged this jar of rouge to aid their
case,
Folding the trembling hands beneath the veil,
Hiding with red the blanching of a face,
Trying to seem at ease; and knowing how
Those tiny beads of sweat can shame a brow!
Perchance an Amir as he went to rest,
With his bare blade across his silken
knees,
Borne in his chair of State by bartizans
That flank the mausoleum in the trees,
Had his face painted from this golden jar
To prove how grand in death great rulers
are.
Perchance a child has played with gold and
gem
And touched a rag doll’s visage from its
lip!
Or two brown lovers spied the empty jar,
Filled it with wine right merrily to sip
Between their kisses, in a madcap mood,
Nor dreamed so fair a thing could taste of
blood.
It may have lain long years where flapping
bats
Clouded the rocky arches of a tomb;
It may have nestled to a mummy’s heart
Among dead flowers, still scented, in the
gloom.
What memories does it hold? What hopes,
what fears
Of loved, lost women through the loved, lost
years.
QUEENSLAND.
M. FORREST.
Mental Brew.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
WHAT I’m going to tell you happened
in the days when, if an American
wanted a “highball,” all he had to
do was to step into the nearest saloon to
get it. If it had been to-day, wdien whisky’s
priced as high as ten dollars and over a
pint, Jimmy Quirk would be sitting back
worth a million—that is, if lie could have
kept off the brew himself. His name would
be a household word, along with the unem-
ployment question and the Soviet Republic.
It was in Chicago I first' met Jimmy. He
was chasing orders for a hardware firm, and
I was “hitting the trail” with softgoods. I
invited him into the bar of the hotel in which
we were lodged, and he opened to me his
genial heart over a series of Martini cock-
tails.
After the usual prologue of business dis-
cussion, the talk veered round to religious
subjects, and I at once perceived that my
new acquaintance was a New Thinker of
the most advanced type. His first remark
stamped him as such.
“Not wishin’ to give any offence,” he said,
“for I don’t know what particular road
you’re travellin’ to the Better Land, but I
believe in the triumph of Spirit over Matter.
Once we have achieved that, our souls march
on triumphant over the sea of doubt, poverty
an’ affliction; the clouds burst, an’ we dwell
for ever in the glorious sunshine.”
I was impressed.
“An’ how do we acquire this?” I asked.
“My friend,” he said, “here is where the
key is kept to the door of the treasure-
house,” an’ he tapped a broad expanse of
forehead, for he had a head suitable for a
man twice his size. “Think wealth, think
happiness, think health —an’ health, happi-
ness an’ wealth ’ll come to you. Nothin’ can
stop ’em.”
It was three years later that I met Jimmy
the second time. He knew me at once, for I
had undergone no radical change; but as for
himself his ow T n mother would have been
hard put to it to recognise him. He was
wearing horn-rim spectacles, his hat was
suitable for a man
with opinions resem-
bling Trotsky’s, and
he sported a velvet
coat similar to one I
saw 7 Paderewski play
Bach in.
“You see before
you,” he said, “a
transformed .J am e s
Quirk.”
“I do,” I replied.
“That is, if it really
is Jimmie Quirk.”
“None other,” he
said. “Concentration
has wrought the
change, an’ I am now
the leader of a little
band of brethren who
also seek soul emanci-
p a t i o n. Welcome,
Brother,” he added.
“Fate has sent me to
lift you up. Tli e
meetin’ starts in ten
minutes.”
Two blocks and a
turn to the right, and
we entered a door de-
corated with a red-
type notice: “Come
and hear Prof. J.
Quirk. Subject: ‘The
fallacy of Animal
Food. Can the Mind
Supply Nourishment?’
8 p.m.”
We entered a small
hall packed with horn-
rim spectacles and
poke-bonnets. I fol-
lowed Quirk down the
aisle, but hesitated at
the steps that led to
the stage. But he
turned and grabbed me
by the arm, and pulled
me up after him.
Taking a gulp that half-emptied a quart-
glass of water standing on a table with a
pot full of pink carnations, he turned to the
congregation.
“Brothers an’ sisters,” he began, “this is
our demonstration night, so after the lec-
ture I’ll confound the doubters with the help
of an old an’ dearly-beloved brother who has
come here seekin’ Truth,” and he turned to
me. “Brother,” he said, “when did you last
partake of the world’s carnal food?”
“I had a pork-chop at mid-day,” I an-
swered, with a note of astonishment.
The announcement was greeted with
groans of anguish from the assembly, who
glowered at me as if I was some cannibal
caught devouring a baby.
“It’s now nearly nine,” said Quirk, con-
sulting a watch, “so your stomach’s again
empty. After the lecture, Brother, I will
fill it with mental sustenance.”
The lecture dealt mainly with the mistake
of over-feeding. Quirk maintained the mid-
day meal should be eliminated. “But,” he
said, “as the meal is a habit that has buried
its talons in the very vitals of humanity, a
substitoot will be necessary.”
He went on to explain how, after a long
and fierce struggle with the fleshpots, he
had found another means of satisfyin’ the
cravin’s of an empty stomach. He had
acquired the faculty of suggestin’ to his inner
man that he was filled with material food ;
and he was such a strong suggester that his
intestines had been quite taken in by the
delusion. “I intend,” he said, “to start a sug-
gestion cafd, where for a paltry fee those
who wish to discontinue the takin’ of super-
fluous food may come an’ avoid the discom-
fort of abstinence. We will now,” he con-
cluded, “proceed with the demonstration.
Brother,” turning to me, “draw your chair
to the centre of the stage.”
Being caught, I decided to go through
with the . foolery, and I acted as requested.
“Imagine,” said Quirk, “you are in your
favorite restaurant, an’ tell me what you’d
like to eat.”
I was feeling tolerably peckish, and I
thought of the feed I would have as soon as
I could get away from this bevy of lunatics.
“I’ll take a double portion of duck and green
peas, followed by a helping of gooseberry-
pie. And split me a pint-bottle of Bur-
gundy.”
“Very good,” said Quirk, and he peei-ed
with an intent look into my eyes, and com-
menced to wave his hands like the leader of
an orchestra.
Now the absurdity of the situation caused
me to give a grin. But the grin had hardly
forsaken my face when I experienced the
sensation old wives attribute to someone
trampling over a future grave, only it was
magnified to the strength of an electric shock
that ran a close second to the chair of death.
These unpleasant symptoms were followed by
others of an entirely different nature. I could
have sworn I was eating the menu I had out-
lined to Quirk. The gooseberry-pie was fol-
lowed by a draught of the sort of Burgundy
that in America is locked to-day in dynamite-
proof steel safes. The repast finished, Quirk
repeated the waving, and I rose from the
chair feeling like a child after a thanks-
giving dinner.
“Now,” said Quirk, “give your testimony,
Brother.”
“Friends,” I said, “I have the feeling of
a man who has eaten in anticipation of a
forty-day fast.”
The gathering rose to the proclamation,
and bellowed like a crowd fanning its favo-
rite baseball star.
“Our restaurant in Main-street,” said
Quirk, “will be open to-morrow, from twelve
till two.”
* * * *
That cafe was an enormous success. The
novelty of the idea seduced the patrons of
the ordinary cafes, so that at mid-day they
were as free from the attentions of their
friends as a sufferer from small-pox. The
population surged in front of Jimmy Quirk’s
establishment, and thousands had to be
turned away disappointed. In order to cope
with the rush, the hours were extended to
from seven in the morning till ten at night.
A quarter—say a shilling—was charged for
any menu of mental food, and fifty cents for
a reserved seat. Parties were catered for
by special arrangement.
Now comes the sad part of the tale.
WASTING NO EFFORT.
EMPLOYER: “I’ll give you five pounds a week to start; in three
months I’ll raise it to six.”
APPLICANT: “ Goodo! I’ll look in again in three months.”
Whether it was due to the strain of so
much suggesting, or whether Jimmy couldn’t
stand prosperity, I can’t say; anyhow, he
took to drink. He started with frequent nips,
and in a couple of weeks he was emptying
a couple of pint-bottles of whisky daily.
The patrons began to drop off, and it wasn’t
long before Jimmy had to close the restau-
rant altogether.
One day I found him in the park, shabby
and dirty and drunk as an owl. I took him
back to my hotel, intending to sober him up.
But could I do it? He had started drink-
ing his own suggestion-liquor. He sat in
my room in that hotel with a queer, far-
away look in his eyes, smacking his lips with
a fine relish.
In another week he was in a home, and
it was the queerest case they’d ever handled.
They couldn’t sober him up, although they
kept him in a room on the top storey with
the door locked and a guard outside. Scient-
ists and doctors came from all over America,
attracted by the strange tale, and they exam-
ined him and consulted over him as if he was
some new bacteria. But the only answers
to the questions they put were hiccups and
drunken songs and jokes. In a month he
was dead, without for the space of one
moment regaining his sobriety.

A Soiled Record.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
IF the potentialities in a bottle of whisky-
are many and varied (which few will
deny) it follows that those within two
bottles are more so. But few, even the most
skilled in such calculations, could have fore-
seen that two (or at most, I swear, less
than three) bottles of perfectly good Scotch,
consumed by a pair of simple planters in
Fiji, would cause a rumpus great enough to
disturb the peace of thousands of men and
Avomen of every class throughout the world,
a disturbance whose echoes are yet (for
aught I know) reverberating in far-off
corners.
The trouble really started when the Gov-
ernment, that should have knoAvn better,
imported from England an agricultural en-
thusiast to advise us to spend a lot of
money on our plantations when they were
barely paying as it was. His enthusiasm
was of the virulently unpleasant sort; not
only did it drive him to attempt things him-
self, but it drove him to try to drive us to
attempt things—which, had he known the
islands, was simply asking for it.
Scarcely had he taken over his depart-
ment when he began to amuse us with
pamphlets and leaflets and letters; but there
is no reason why our emotions should ever
have gone deeper had not the man himself
suddenly appeared among us. He was wiry
and dark, with a big black moustache and
restless movements. He had the close-set
eyes of the fanatic and a How of words on
the smallest occasion—the sort of chap who
radiates trouble as fire radiates heat, lie
passed through the district like a tornado.
He could barely spare time to eat his meals.
He and his numerous brown retainers
swarmed over our lands digging chunks of
earth and sand and clay from nats and
gullies and hilltops. For it seemed that
analysis of the soil was all the rage; he used
to hold forth on the verandah of the place
wnere he happened to be staying, and from
far and near we gathered to him and sat
about humbly, very conscious of our igno-
rance, as was expected of us. Yes, Science
was penea’aung the Tropics and Agriculture
was to be Revolutionised —his speech was
stiff Avith capital letters. Facts were Avhat
was needed. Now, some fool in Ceylon or
Hong Kong (we learned) had published a
bulletin which Avas all rot, and some other
fool in Barbadoes or Nigeria or somewhere
had answered it with one that was even
greater rot;. but our visitor was going to
pumish one that would be absolutely the
real thing. So ne passed along leaving the
district pitted witn little holes as with some
horrid form of small-pox and Ave lapsed once
more into our old muddling ways of igno-
rance and peace.
The Enthusiast was to take ship back to
Suva from Merrick’s place at the end of the
island: and after what I thought sufficient
time to alloAv for this I rode over the hills
to see how my friend and his neighborhood
had fared. It was a long day’s journey,
and when at last I rode up to the verandah
Avliat should I see but the Enthusiast leaning
forward in his chair telling Merrick about the
MATRIMONIAL FINANCE.
"Jack and, Topsy seem to have made marriage a successful
business.”
“Yes—married five years and a dividend annually.”
bulletins from Barbadoes, or something so
similar that the effects were identical. Poor
old Merrick looked like a patient in the
dentist’s chair, and his polite smile with
which he heard of the fools in Ceylon or
Hong Kong was a ghastly affair. He nearly
shed tears of relief when he saw me, and
the Enthusiast took another breath during
the interruption and started off again. Lord,
how that man could talk! Then Mrs.
Merrick came out and seated herself near
the speaker and smiled sAveetly while Merrick
took me to my room. We could hear the
sermon on soils still going on ; Merrick ex-
plained that he and his wife took it in
relays and that they hoped, now that I had
come to help out, to stay the distance. “The
boat’s been delayed, but she’s in the river
now—came in this afternoon —he’ll be gone
to-morrow. And, anyway, the drought's
lifted—got a couple of cases coming ashore
at this moment—and by Jove if ever I
needed a tonic.... !”
When avc got back to the verandah the
tonic had just been unpacked and a boy
was approaching the Enthusiast bearing a
tray Avith decanter and glasses. Merrick
beamed hospitably upon his guest; but that
gentleman raised a firm hand, palm out-
wards, and told us he never touched it.
Poor Merrick wilted visibly and his eyes
took on a sort of glaze as he waved the boy
out of sight. From this onwards it was
plain that our host had surrendered to fate.
At dinner he made no pretence of sharing
Avith his wife the appropriate responses to
the Enthusiast’s ceaseless monologue, and
it was Mrs. Merrick who suggested that, as
the boat sailed at daylight, she hoped the
departing guest would get a good, long night’s
rest, because “you know what these small
island cutters are,” and she did hope he
had no tiresome book-Avork to finish. The
Enthusiast rose to it like clock-work and was
grateful for the reminder; and when he had
hurried off early to his room Merrick kissed
“ON APPRO.”
VISITOR: “So you’d rather hare a baby brother?”
TOMMY: "Yes, but mother 's had it over a week, so we’ll have to keep it now.”
his wife and waltzed round the table with
her.
About 50 yards from the dwelling Merrick
had a large out-house which he used as a
storeroom and general-utility place; and
at one end he had enclosed what he called
“an office.” It han all the requisites for
business—guns and saddles and fishing-rods,
easy chairs and a cabinet holding cigars and
a tantalus and glasses, not to mention tne
novels and magazines scattered about. I
suppose it was about midnight, or maybe
a little later, that my host and I sat there
and he was moved to recount the story of
his wrongs. “I’ll bet this island is a bit
smaller when he gets away—if only you’d
seen him pile in here three days ago—mree
days, old man!—and the place as dry as one
of his oavu pamphlets—-with an army of
porters laden with his bally samples all in
pots or somethin’ wrapped in scrim and
labelled —there must be tons of ’em—-an’ the
fuss he made cluckin’ about like a hen with
young chickens —nobody must go near the
beastly things, much less touch ’em—come
an’ have a look.”
We got up and opened the door into the
larger part of the building, and there Avas
the floor nearly hidden beneath a glooming
pile of earthenware pots and little wooden
boxes all muffled
in sacking and
scrim and care-
fully tied and
labelled. As Mer-
rick said, there
must have been
tons of soil. He
picked up a pack-
age and brought
it to the light
and leered at it.
“Yes,” he said
bitterly, “I knoiv
t his h kinder
blightersh. They
think they’re
clever because
they can tell us
how to make our
land produce
more. Damfools.
anyone knows
that. They for-
getsh we’ve got
to make the land
pay. If we were
only doin’ this for
fun and dam’ the
expense, ’course
we could projoosh
more; but if we
had money would
we come here, or
would Ave stay
here? Tliasli Avhat
they forgot.” He
shook his head
in infinite sad-
ness and turned
a sorrow - laden
eye upon me.
His brilliant argumentation made tue tears
start to my own eyes, but Merrick allowed
me no time to consider my grief. He held
his sample to the light and apostrophised it.
“Yes, there y’are, bit of my own land mos’
likely.” He leered at the label —“Sample
number 193 section M” he read. “Blightersh
got a map, I s’pose, marked in sections.”
This struck us both as a disgusting thing to
have. “Funny thing if he losht it-—eh? —
get all his shamples mixed up?” Never was
there such a joke, and we laughed till the
roof rang.
Then—well, I really don’t know how it
happened (I fancy the third bottle must
have been opened about this time —I counted
them in the morning), but a couple of hours
after enjoying the joke Merrick and I rose
to our knees and stood back to gaze Avith
pride on our handiwork. “Sample 193 sec-
tion M” was now labelled “Sample 50 section
H,” “Sample 56 section H” now bore the
legend “Sample 211 section P,” and so on.
If there were any not fitted with tresh tags
we felt it to be due to sheer ill luck and not
to want of zeal on our part. We sat silent
awhile in contemplation of our good work,
and I think we shook hands once or twice,
while Merrick wept a little as he thought
again of the outrage done our district by
the map in sections —and then we went
to bed.
The Enthusiast got away at daylight.
Merrick went down to see him off and offer
his labor to help carry the hundreds of
samples to the boat. We met at breakfast
(Mrs. M. tactfully staying abed), and pushed
devilled kidneys and mushrooms about our
plates, and drank several cups of strong
coffee in silence. Then my horse was brought
round and I set off for the long ride home.
It was nearly six months before anything
happened. Then it was merely a local dis-
turbance. But it grew—heavens, how it
grew! Settlers all over the Group began
to be bombarded with letters and pamphlets
that produced at first a stunned sensation
and then howls of unholy joy. Men whose
plantations grew on the sea-frontage, prac-
tically all sand, were told to spread some
more of that substance over their holdings
if they would escape ruin. Men whose cocoa-
nuts flourished exceedingly in deep-soiled val-
leys were told that analysis had proved the
site to be absolutely barren, and some fer-
tiliser now being imported by the Govern-
ment should be dug in at once. The stuff
would cost not more than about fifty pounds
a ton, and a few tons per acre might make
all the difference! Men clearing bush were
told to waste no more time at it because
the soil there had never grown anything, and
couldn’t possibly do it. Merrick was advised
to shift his plantation to the tops of some
barren hills that had shown a perfect soil
content, and I was adjured to drain heavily
where it had been necessary to irrigate for
years.
The chance was one of a lifetime. From
all quarters there rained upon the bewildered
Enthusiast in Suva sarcastic letters remind-
ing him of his expressed desire for facts as
the things that mattered, and adding that
therefore he would be glad to learn that liis
alleged “barren and worthless” soils had
been for years producing every sort of island
crop in abundance. The theme w’s the same
in all, but the treatment varied. Some plant-
ers of a sporting turn offered to make the
rival opinions a matter of wagers, and others
threatened legal proceedings for libel of their
properties and damaged credit. There were
others again that struck a more intimate
note, when outraged feelings were relieved
by reference to the Enthusiast’s personal
dualities with suggested medical treatment.
The poor man was stricken with amazement
until there burst upon him the dazzling solu-
tion. To him alone among mortals had the
astounding revelation been given, and clearly
it was. his sacred duty that the world should
share it as soon as possible. It did.
My accomplice in crime and I had kept
clear of this correspondence. (There was
still clinging to us some shred of decency.)
He came over to see me after things were
beginning to hum. “What puzzles me,” he
said, “is that the whole blessed Group is
involved. Seems he must have had all his
samples from all the islands at my place.
By .Tove, we have done it!”
“It seems so,” I said. “Look at this.”
I showed him a paper to hand by the latest
mail. If gave an account of a public lecture
by the Enthusiast in Suva, where the won-
ders and _ anomalies of tropical soils were
told and illustrated by lantern-slides. Mer-
rick read to the end. where the lecturer de-
clared : “It is evident that all our pre-
conceived ideas of tropical agriculture will
have to be revised, and all the old formulae,
accepted on too little evidence, must be dis-
card'A.” At this point Merrick began to
whistle under his breath.
But the fireworks had only just started.
We were soon learning all about them in let-
ters from the proud Enthusiast himself and
in the local press and tropical journals. It
seemed our man had a string of fellowships
and degrees after his name, and was quite
a big-gun in his way, so that his pronounce-
ments had been listened to all round the
Equatorial Belt. Sunilar enthusiasts rose
up in every conceivable place—in Singapore,
Colombo, Cyprus, Malta, West Indies, Cen-
tral America, Borneo and so forth, not to
mention our neighboring islands—and began
slanging mo- man. (Until then I had never
had the slightest idea how widespread was
the interest in agriculture.) He retorted with
superbly colored and indexed maps and
columns of solemn twaddle and analyses
worked out to three places of decimals. The
others came back with heavy stuff —planta-
tion statistics, with quotations from “autho-
rities” and references to standard “works.”
The Enthusiast swept it all aside like a
hero, and nut down a barrage of photo-
graphs to illustrate his bulletins, and fac-
similes of letters from “practical men.” The
Government press in Suva kept up a drum-
fire of literature to all the world (including
us), imploring it to trust to facts (see
analyses herewith”), and not to listen to a
lot of ignorant humbugs who had been con-
tent to accept the old formula? without veri-
fication. The amazing thing was that sev-
eral of the ignorant humbugs began to show
signs of coming over, and one or two actually
produced analyses of soils long known in
Trinidad or Guiana as good, but which read
as bewilderingly rotten as any from our side.
The Colonial Institute took it up, and the
Imperial Institute and several other such
conclaves of solemn has-beens, and it was
resolved in more than one place “That the
attention of the Secretary of State for the
Colonies be called to the rise of the New
Agriculture” (so they styled it), “and that
he be asked to urge upon the Crown Colony
Government the desirability of taking steps,”
etc.
Lastly the financial world began to re-
act —it was getting serious. And when we,
dazed and incredulous, had read reports of
rubber and cotton and cocoa and similar
companies ■ suspending development until the
New Agriculture had been further investi-
gated, and of brand new companies with
flamboyant prospectuses and impressive
directorates about to take up vast barren
areas for cultivation of every sort of tropi-
cal product (with our Enthusiast’s analyses
and pronouncements side by side with
analyses of the new lands in question)—l
say when we read this sort of stuff we were
getting serious too. The climax came when
we learned" that a huge tract on our own
island, famed so far only for weeds and
vermin, was being surveyed for another com-
pany with the most lurid prospectus yet.
And I couldn’t decide if it was the irony
of fate or poetic justice or the two com-
bined that caused our own properties to be
held up with others as examples of what
the desert was soon to be like, since the
soil-contents were identical!
“Oh, damn it,” said Merrick, “this is over
the odds. It must be stopped. Think of
all the widows and orphans putting their
mites into these damfool concerns! Would
you have believed men and women outside
an asylum could be such champion lunatics?”
Which was very wise, but not immediately
helpful. For it was plain that we two were
due at the stool of confession without delay
—and it was a toss-up whether absolution or
damnation would result, with odds in favor
of the latter.
Anyway, we went in to Suva, and, not
without _ mixed feelings, made an appoint-
ment with the Governor. The preliminary
hearing was in the afternoon and might have
been worse. During our recital his Excel-
lency’s feelings also seemed mixed, to judge
by his expression, but at the end he managed
to reprimand us severely in an official voice.
We were then “sentenced” to attend an in-
formal dinner that evening.
The informality was more conspicuous
than the dinner, for no one could eat very
much, and the behavior of the majority of
the guests was not at all correct. Half the
THE POINT OF VIEW.
“Do you think stripes make people look
longer?”
“Oh, yes, some of them actually stare.”
service was gathered together—needless to
say, without the Enthusiast, for fairly obvi-
ous reasons. The interview of the afternoon
and several visits in the interim had given
us our bearings, and we naturally, if weakly,
decided to sail with the wind. Before the
soup disappeared we were called upon for
the story. Beginning with the small-pox
visitation we gave a detailed sequence, and
by the time we had'arrived at the new com-
panies, his Ex. was swaying in his chair and
feebly wiping the tears, while several highly-
important departmental heads were on the
table.
Before we left the cables to England were
humming, and his Ex. assured us the financial
end would be straightened out as soon as
possible. The private secretary walked back
with us to the hotel and told us that his
Excellency had no “official” knowledge of
how the fraud started, and until we had re-
ceived information of the same sort we were
to lie low. “And, strictly between our-
selves, the Chief is frantically grateful to
you fellows for getting rid of that chap—
he’s tried to get him shifted —he’s such an
ass —but can’t. But he’ll never live this
down —that was what the dinner was for.
So good-night and mum’s the word.”
We lay so low that official shootings (if
any) must have passed over our heads, since
nothing hit us. Unofficially, however, we
heard that the Enthusiast shortly applied for
a transfer back to England on account of iiis
health, and the excitement in the agricul-
tural world died down. I don’t know if the
gentleman’s health was restored or not, but
it is understood that his enthusiasm for agri-
culture, particularly of the tropic sort, has
greatly abated, and that he now puts it into
occasional lectures on the evils of drink—
especially in the Colonies.
If this has any connection with the fore-
going we have not been officially notified—
but I shouldn’t wonder if it has.

Australian Light Horsemen.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
HOW swift the hour! Our fighting days
die bravely in the wake of time
That speeds with scanty breath for
praise of men who hold secure the
bays
They won when gallant hearts were prime
For conquest in the van of strife. Ah,
how it maimed and throbbed and thun-
dered
'ln climes where fell disease w r as rife, where
horsemen lived the soldier’s life
And all the bloom of youth was plundered!
How radiantly they took the tide which bore
them far afield* to fight!
They saddled up with nervous pride before
the racking desert ride
That wrung the heart and dimmed the sight.
Strange scenes the years with wisdom deep
revealed in tones and colors flaring;
By voiceless wastes and ranges steep, in
gorges dim where torrents leap.
They quelled the spite of time unsparing.
Rough riders from the timbered hills, good
horsemen from the open plains,
Staunch lads who toiled in mines and mills,
scarred men who knew the pace that
kills
Clipped on the spurs and seized the reins.
Oh such a host the ages dead have seldom
watched with eyes of wonder!
They scorned the pallid face of dread as.
knee to knee, they spurred and sped
And rode the bayonet asunder.
They stretched the hempen picket-line
through palmy groves in Sinai;
They quaffed the ruby native wine among
the groves of Palestine,
While “Gothas” dropped across the sky.
They camped by Syrian waterways, the
snowclad Lebanons above them;
They smoked around the fitful blaze and
shared their meat on winter days
With ragged souls that learned to love
them.
Across the drift, when days were lean, they
starved and sought the fairer things;
Down avenues of olive green the tossing
of their plumes was seen.
When muffled, were the thunderings
Of mountain-guns on rocky walls whence
torrents gush and waters sally,
lit answer to the battle calls they mustered
where the Jordan falls
To seas of slumber in the valley.
We see again in calmer nights their columns
surging fast and far;
The scenes of many wild delights beneath
the glaring caf£ lights.
Secure a space from toil and war.
And troop by troop, in even file they ride
in triumph down the highway
To catch the wicked glance of guile in many
a crimson-tinted smile
From portals in the darker byway.
The domes of old Jerusalem, the. chapel
spires and turrets tall,
The bells that tolled the requiem, the olive-
trees that harbored them
Without the ancient city wall
Are etched on silent visionings in crowded
walks and ways forsaken ;
And when the lonely horseman sings or plays
on fancy’s varied strings
None but the fondest echoes waken.
The cypress lanes of Nazareth, the placid
shores of Galilee,
The rides from out the vale of death to
meet the honey-laden breath
Of morning at Gethsemane!
READY FOR HIM.
STRETOHEM: “You never saw such a fish!”
BOREDSTIFF : “No more did you.”
Old thoughts! and yet they treasure them,
those weary men who sought the
healing
Which peace bestowed, when leaf and stem
lent shade in holy Bethlehem
And all the heavenly bells were pealing.
Oh, who has seen the columns wind like ser-
pents through the desert night,
On weary treks, in days unkind, the torrid
sun grow dim and kind
When choking dust obscured the sight?
And who has heard on starry ways the
torrents of the shod hoofs falling
And watched far minarets ablaze when morn-
ing woke wdth songs of praise
From gardens in the sunlight calling?
The sunlight kissed the white fagades and
lay on distant dome and fane;
It flashed upon the bright steel blades held
rigid by the brown brigades
That stormed across Damascus plain.
But, oh, it was a triumph ride—no force
to match them or to hold them!
Peace whispered in the spaces wide. In
Paradise the daylight died
And night crept softly to enfold them.

GERARDY.
Not a Matter of Choosing.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
u ] *OR love of a lady I come from the
l”* sea—for love of a lovely la-dy!”
Thus, fiddle to chin, standing in the
centre of the cabin, dressed ready for the
shore, improvised the young blonde god who
captained the just-arrived trading schooner
Lui and was nicknamed Fors because he
came from Helsingfors.
“Meaning Maud Harcourt, I suppose,” in-
terrupted the elderly mate. “It’s always
Maud when w T e come here to Mobo.”
“Meaning Maud,” said Fors.
The mate frowned. “You’re a fool, Fors.
Listen here. This trip alone there was Jean-
ette, the little typist at Francois’s store at
Papeete; at Apia there was the girl at the
English missionary’s place”—he ticked them
off on his fingers—“at Levuka that pearler’s
niece”
“At Suva the brown-haired companion to
that sugar-planter’s
wife,” put in Fors
with a laugh.
“And the plant-
er's wife herself, I
reckon. That’s five,
and maybe there
were others. They
all had the glad-
eye ready for you,
Fors. It was like
a game, watching
them. You only
had to look at them
the right way. But
you never did, not
once.”
“One can’t love
at will,” said Fors,
and began again on
his song. The
mate regarded
admiringly and
somewhat enviously
the man whose
manner and build
made him a thing
for woman-wor-
ship.
“If it had been
me,” he interrupted
aga i n, “with a
bunch like that to
pick from, I reckon
I'd have had a shot
at it, anyway. Cer-
tainly,” lie went on,
“I wouldn’t come
wasting my time
on Maud Harcourt.
Mind you. Fors,
it’s not that she
isn’t straight, for I
reckon she is. And
it’s not that she
isn’t attractive;
why, every young
feller in the settle-
ment here is after
her. And it isn’t
that she’s only a barmaid in a New Guinea
rough-house hotel, and perhaps a bit com-
mon”
“Then what is it?”
“You know as well as I do, F'ors. You’re
no more to her than the settlement fellers
that are always hanging round her. She’s
about the only woman I know who didn’t
fall for you at sight. Now, if you were the
kind of chap that couldn’t get a girl nohow
I could understand you chasing her the way
you do, thinking about her, making up songs
about her, and all that. As it is” He
waved a hand expressively. “With all those
others to choose from, why do you bother
with her?” he asked.
The young blonde god put down his fiddle.
TRANSMOGRIFIED.
ST. PETER: “I can’t let you in. You're not the man in this photo.”
BLINKS : “Oh, that’s me all right. You see, lam going from the wife for ever now. "
There was something regal about the expres-
sion in his eyes. “Love is not a matter of
choosing,” he said. “It just comes.”
“So that’s how it is, Fors?” said the mate,
and whistled softly.
“That’s how it is,” said Fors. Then the
laughter came back to his eyes and the song
to his lips, and he went out on deck and
ashore.
* * * *
The hotel, hedged by flowering shrubs and
shaded by tall palms, stood back a little from
the head of the pier.
Natives, admirers of phy-
sical perfection, clicked
their fingers against their
teeth in token of appre-
ciation as Fors came up,
and on the verandah
white men hailed him
cheerily. Maud nodded,
and came to him when
he entered the bar.
“Hullo, Fors, old thing!
Had a good trip?”
Thinking how well the
whiteness of her dress set
off the blackness of her
hair, and how well the
blackness of her hair set
off the clearness of her
skin, he eagerly scanned
her face. She looked wor-
ried, he thought.
“Hullo, Maud,” he said,
and squeezed fervently
the hand she extended
him across the counter.
She replied with a con-
ventional pressure, and
politely, yet decisively,
took her hand away.
“What’ll you have,
Fors?” she asked, busi-
ness-like, impersonal.
“I want only one thing”
—meaningly.
“Lucky man ! I want
lots of things.”
He looked at her as many a woman had
longed for him to look. There was no re-
sponse in her eyes.
“Oh, whisky,” he said abruptly, and she
turned to the shelves.
When she placed the drink before him he
noticed again her worried look.
“Something troubling you, Maud?” he
asked gently.
A startled expression came into her black
eyes, and a trembling to her hands.
“If there’s anything I can do” he
offered-
She was regarding him now with strained
intensity.
“Fors. do you still think about me like you
used to?”
“More than ever,” he told her. “First
thing in the morning, last at night, and all
the time in between. When we tied up to
the pier this afternoon I had to get out my
fiddle and play and sing a song I’ve made
up about you. My dear, my dear”
“Wait a moment,” she said in a tone of
decision, and left to attend to other custo-
mers. Returning, she placed an assistant
in charge of the bar, came round the counter,
took Fors into a side parlor and shut the
door.
“Fors, would you do something for me?”
“Anything in the world. I’ve told you
often enough.”
“But would you—really?”
“I wasn’t joking then, Maud, and I’m not
joking now.”
She hesitated a moment, as though her
decision was failing her. Then: “Suppose it
was something dangerous?”
“It wouldn’t matter what it was.”
“Suppose it was to help a—a lawbreaker
—to escape?”
“I would do it.”
Her eyes widened as from awe. . j
“Love is a wonderful strong thing, isn t
it!” She said it reflectively, as though, in-
deed, all this was confirmation of some other
and more personal experience of the strength
of love.
“Who is this person who has broken the
law?” Fors asked.
“Someone very—very dear to me.”
He glanced at her sharply. Her gaze
wavered.
“My brother,” she added hurriedly.
“I didn’t know you had a brother.”
“You’ve been away so much. You haven’t
met him,” she said in the same hurried tone,
and went on before he could speak: “He’s
up in the mountains shooting birds-of-para-
dise. I didn’t want him to go. I was afraid
he would get caught. Shooting paradise-
birds is against the law. They’re awfully
strict about it. There’s imprisonment if he’s
caught.”
“And the authorities have got wind of
what he’s doing?”
“Yes.” Her face was white as paper. She
was trembling as from cold. He made to put
an arm about her to steady her. She pushed
him back.
“I got it from one of the Government
chaps,” she said presently. “He’d had a few
drinks, and wasn’t careful what he said. A
patrol is leaving to-morrow morning. They’ll
catch him for sure. Bill doesn’t know they
know.”
She held out her hands appealingly. It
was all he could do to refrain from taking
them and drawing her to him.
“Fors, could you, would you, go and warn
him? I can tell you where he is. The Gov-
ernment chap told me. It’s only a little over
a day’s tramp. Fors. could you, would you?
You said you’d do anything for me.” The
words poured from her. “There’s no one
else I could trust. He’ll get two years if
he’s caught. Two years of Hell. Fors,
you’re my only hope! Go to him and tell
him to burn his bird-skins. If they don’t
find any skins in his possession they can’t
do anything. That’s the law. I found out
all about it from the Government chap. They
might suspect him, but they can’t touch
him.” Her breast was heaving jerkily, her
eyes were wet and her voice eame hoarsely
now. “I wouldn’t ask you, Fors, only I’m
desperate. I’ve been wmrried to death about
it. They mustn’t catch him!” She came
close to him, her face upturned, supplieat-
ingly. “Help me. Fors ! Save him !”
He took her hands gently, and looked
earnestly into her eyes. “Your brother, you
say?” he said evenly. “You can leave it to
me, Maud.”
And with that he bent his blonde head and
touched her cheek chastely with his lips.
* * * *
Back on the Lui, he informed the mate he
would be absent a day or two on private
business; and soon after dark, carrying rifle,
provision-pack and sleeping gear, he set off
along the flat road leading out of the settle-
ment.
“For love of a lovely la-dy !” he sang some-
times as he walked the deserted miles, but
HIS OWN FAULT, THEN.
DAD : “That hoy er yours ain’t too partic’lar ’ow much er
my gas ’e burns!”
SIS: “There’s none wasted after you go to bed, Dad.”
oftener was silent and thoughtful. At mid-
night he spread his sleeping gear at the side
of the road and camped, lie could afford to
rest; he had at least five hours’ start of the
patrol. At dawn he was on the way again;
and after a time he left the road for a side-
path which, from the directions Maud had
given him, he recognised as the route to the
mountains. For a little distance the path
was flat as the road, then slopes came into
it, each steeper than the last, and tortuous
windings. Used so long to the flatness of a
deck, Fors’s legs soon began to rebel at these
unaccustomed angles. Also, the steepness
robbed him of breath. Athletic though he
was, he was compelled to reduce his pace.
At mid-day he rested and ate. He was
right in the heart of the jungle now—a
jungle so dense that the sun mostly failed
to pierce it. The light was like a twilight.
Of the path ahead and behind he could see
no more than a score yards. To either side
he could see no distance at all; there was
only a riot of trees and undergrowth close-
growing as a hedge. He didn’t like this
limited vision. He was too accustomed to
the wideness of the sea. There was freedom
in wideness. Here he had a sense of being
shut in, imprisoned. Then there was the
silence. Rarely did a bird chirp; rarely was
there a sound other than the crunching of
twigs beneath his feet. The jungle was alive
with creeping, crawling and flying things;
but they crept, crawled and flew in silence.
To Fors came the fancy that this place,
where light was dubious and vision limited,
had subdued them, just as it would subdue
him if he remained in it much longer.

After a time the path grew fainter. Men
came this way but seldom, apparently. For
considerable distances it was overgrown,
swallowed by the jungle. A dozen times in
an hour he lost it—to find it again only by
a laborious retracing of his steps. About
three o’clock he rested again. Time was get-
ting on. His five hours’ start would be by
now considerably reduced. At any time he
might hear the voices of the patrol party.
He was afraid he was making a mess of
things. He would have to do better than
this. Stiff, weary, he rose and started off
again.
With the declining of the sun the path
became fainter than ever. Finally he lost
it completely. After an hour of vainly search-
ing for it, he decided to make for his objec-
tive in a straight line. He had all of the
sailor’s sense of direction. But bushcraft
was needed besides. Repeatedly did his
plunging through the tangle of the jungle
bring him only to some impassable place—
a cliff, a precipice, a straight-sided chasm.
There seemed no way by which he could go
forward, save by the path, and he couldn’t
find the path.
A little before sundown lie heard voices,
and presently glimpsed almost within touch-
ing distance of him the blue uniforms of the
Armed Native Constabulary and the khaki
coat of the officer-in-charge. He was almost
on the path, and hadn’t known it! Con-
cealed by the undergrowth, he watched them
swing by in single file, a bush-native, naked
save for a loin-clout, leading the way. When
they were safely ahead, he followed them.
Their passage made the path quite plain.
At all costs he would have to get ahead of
them. He couldn’t let Maud down. She
was depending on him. She’d be thinking
of him now. tins minute, all the time, won-
dering how he was succeeding. It was grati-
fying to think she was thinking of him.
He turned a sharp bend in the path and
found himself looking into the muzzle of a
revolver held by the khaki-clad officer.
“Who is it?” The officer came nearer,
peering in the half-light. “Fors Larsen, by
all that’s holy! I thought it might have
been some mischief-making hillmen. My
natives said they heard someone coming along
behind —they’ve got keen ears, you know—
so I waited to see who it was. What are
you doing away up here, so far from your
native element?”
“Thought I’d see what the land looked like
after so long at sea,” Fors answered easily.
“I got lost. And you?”
“Business, of course. After a bird-
hunter. I’m camping to-night at a native
village a little further on. You’d better
camp with me. It will be good to have some-
one to yarn with.”
“It will be good to get out of this jungle
stuff,” said Fors.
The village was perched on a ridge which
overlooked a chaos of jungle-clad valleys and
peaks. Here and there trickled up smoko
from cooking-fires in villages. On the side
of one valley showed the white of a tent.
“My bird-hunter’s camp,” said the officer
with an indicating movement of his hand, as
after a meal they sat on a log and smoked.
“Yes?” said Fors.
The officer was communicative.
THE HARD WORD.
MRS NEWLYWED: “At last, dear man, we two are oner!"
THE DEAR MAN: “Yes, and don’t forget I’m that one.”
“Man named Davidson. Know him?”
Fors knocked out liis pipe and refilled it,
the movements slow, deliberate.
“Never heard of him.” he said. “Perhaps,
though, it’s an assumed name. A man doing
what he’s doing might easily take another
name.” ,
The officer gave a decisive shake of lus
head. “I guess not. I’ve gone thoroughly
into his history. I make a point of knowing
all about a man I’m after. You never know
when the information might come in handy.”
“I see,” said Fors, and lit his pipe, and
for a long time stared at the white spot
which was a tent on the valley’s side. Later,
as they were about to turn in for the night,
lie said: “I’ll make back for the coast early,
and will be gone probably before you’re up.”
He paused. “I suppose you’ll go after this
man Harcourt first thing in the morning?”
“Davidson,” the officer corrected.
“Davidson,” 1 mean.
THE SEASON’S CLIP.
“Immediately after breakfast. What made
you think his name was Harcourt?”
“I didn't think his name w r as Harcourt,”
said F'ors slowly, and sought his blankets.
With the first of the dawn Fors stole out
of the sleeping camp and through the village
and down into the chaos of valleys and peaks.
He had fixed in his memory the position
of the bird-hunter’s camp. The travelling
was easier than that of yesterday, and after
tw T o hours’ tramping he came upon the tent.
The bird-hunter reached for his rifle as
Fors appeared. He was an evil-looking per-
son, low of forehead and with small eyes set
too close together.
“What is it?” he asked harshly.
Fors stated his business at once.
. “The patrol will be here this morn-
ing—
The man’s eyes glinted. “What’s that to
do with me? Why should I be afraid of the
damn patrol?”
“You know best, of
course,” said Fors evenly.
“But I reckon you don’t
want to have any birdskins
around when the patrol ar-
rives, that’s all.”
The bird-hunter put down
his rifle slowly and stepped
closer to Fors, studying him
intently.
“Sure you’re not kidding
me?” he asked suspiciously.
“Why should I kid you?”
“Who are you? Why
should you think I got any
skins? Why should you
come here to give me the
tip about the patrol.”
“It matters neither who I
am nor why I have come,”
said Fors. “I advise you to
get busy burning your birds.
The patrol is on the
way”
“You’ve come up from
Mobo?” the bird-hunter
asked thoughtfully. “When
is there a steamer out?”
Fors reflected. The
monthly Japanese steamer
was due to-day.
“To-night,” he answered.
“That’ll do. I know a
short cut to the settlement.
There’ll be just time.” He
ran into the tent, and from
a box took out the unstuffed
skins of a hundred or more
birds-of-paradise—birds with
tails that trailed wondrously,
birds proudly crested, birds
black and shining like new
coal and splashed with red
like flames, birds blue like
the sea, birds all green and
gold and crimson blended,
birds whose colors were as
laughter, though their eyes
were closed in death. From
the tent-door Fors watched
him make them into a bundle.
“What’s the idea?” he asked.
“Catch me burning them when there’s a
chance of getting away with them!” replied
the bird-hunter. “I’ll be on that steamer
and away before the patrol feller can get
back to the settlement.” He sxvung the
bundle on his back. “They’re worth a thou-
sand quid. Are you coming?” And without
awaiting a reply he swung off through the
jungle.
Fors followed him. If he returned the
way he had come he would meet the patrol,
and the reason of his presence here in the
hills would be betrayed. By taking the bird-
liunter's short cut he would avoid the patrol
altogether. He kept just a little behind the
man, who followed a path scarcely perceptible
to other eyes than his. No doubt this was
the secret route by which he brought his
consignments of skins to the settlement for
illicit shipment.
Fors no longer hummed his song. He
tried not to think of Maud. He was afraid
to think of her. He tried to occupy himself
with thoughts of the sea, of far places and
people he knew, of Jeanette and the pearler’s
niece and the others. He found himself
recurring to the subject of Maud—and his
companion. With each mile a dislike of the
man grew stronger in him. The hot blood
surged up. He would like to choke the life
out of this evil-looking person. It would be
easy, so easy. But how would he be able
to face Maud?
“How did you know what I was doing up
here in the hills?” Davidson asked over his
shoulder as they strode along. “There was
only one person in the settlement who knew.”
“It was she who told me,” said Fors.
For a time they went on in silence. Then
the bird-hunter asked curiously: “What are
you doing this for?”
“She asked me. She heard the patrol was
setting out.”
Davidson laughed evilly. “She would be
anxious, of course —she’s struck on me, the
fool; she’s been a damn nuisance. I sup-
pose you’re struck on her like the rest? She’s
always got a fool-crowd hanging round after
her. What tale did she spin about me?”
“She said you were her brother,” replied
Fors quietly.
“Her brother! And you swallowed the
yarn?”
“I did not,” said Fors in the same quiet
tone.
“And you came all the same!” For the
next half-mile there was silence. Then
Davidson laughed.
“Well, you’re the biggest fool of the
lot!” he sneered.
They reached the settlement at midnight.
At the pier lay the Japanese steamer, a black
blot shot through with bright lights. From
the absence of any clamor of winches and
cries of native cargo-workers it was evident
her loading was done and she was ready
for sea.
Davidson made straight for her. Fors
pulled him back.
“Not till I’ve shown her I did what she
asked,” he said grimly, and laid a great,
hand on the other’s shoulder and steered him
through the tall palms to the hotel.
The place was in darkness, but Fors knew
the position of Maud’s window. He rapped
on the glass, and presently the window went
up and a head appeared.
“It’s me—Fors —and —Davidson.”
“Oh !” she said in a quick intake of the
breath, and vanished. In a few moments
she was with them among the palms.
“Bill!” she whispered. She had thrown:
on a flimsy kimono of blue silk. Her hair
seemed blacker than ever, and her skin
clearer. To Fors she had never been more
desirable.
“Bill!” she whispered again, and flung her
arms about Davidson.
“Out it out! I got no time to waste! I
got to get on that steamer.”
“You’re going away?”
He had freed himself of her now. He
pushed her from him.
“I'm not fool enough to chuck away a
thousand quids’ worth of skins.”
“Bill, don’t go—don’t leave me! Bill!”
Her hands were extended. w T ide apart, en-
treatingly. The words throbbed, passionate,
living, as though her heart itself articulated
them rather than her lips.
“Nothing doing!” was Davidson’s response.
Searing the night came a blast from the
steamer’s whistle, then another.
“Two blasts!” cried Davidson. “She’s
ready to go. I got to step lively.” He
tightened his grip of his bundle and set off,
running, to the pier; and presently Fors
saw him ascend the bright-lit gangway.
Still as a statue, Maud watched. Fors
did not speak. The steamer whistled again
—three long blasts. A winch rattled and
the gangway went up. The vessel moved out
and away, and presently was clear of the
harbor and lost to sight behind the shoulder
of the land.
Maud leaned against a palm-trunk as for
support. A little wind rustled the foliage
musically. Out from the shore a canoeman
chanted quietly a fishing song. The warm
air was subtle with the scents of night-
flowering plants. The man went slowly to
the girl. She was dry-eyed, but her face
was drawn. He took her hand and regarded
her intently.
“Maud,” he said, “why bother about him.
—you who can choose from so many.”
She took her hand away slowly. He nad
a feeling of being rebuked. _
There was something regal about the ex-
pression in her eyes.
“Love is not a matter of choosing, she
said. “It just—just comes.”
Then she turned and went back to her
room, and Fors, thinking of Jeanette and
the pearler’s niece and the others, echoed
the words as he made slowly down through
the palms to the pier. As he boarded the
Lui and entered his cabin his improvised
song came to him, but with significant altera-
tions. “For love of a lady I came froin the
sea!” he sang as he took up his fiddle. “For
love of a lady Igo back to sea. For love of
a lovely la-dy!”

STARS.
LOOK upwards (say our preachers) at
the stars,
To kill the arrogance of human-kind!
Yet what is that vast pageant but a blind
Of frayed-thin curtain-stuff, through which
peer bright
Pin-points innumerable in the height,
Frozen in space—with nothing else be-
hind —
A panorama by pure chance designed, _
From which mankind is taught a lesson trite ?
Some hand has hammered in upon the black,
Bleak walls of sombre night a shiny tack—
The vacant-visaged Moon ; and tiny Mars —
A cigarette-butt smouldering to its end!
And ’neath those long-dead eyes I compre-
hend
The paltry insignificance of stars!
DEATH.
This Thug called Death! He comes relent-
lessly
So patient for his prey, so sure! No trace
Of him, no glimpses of a furtive face;
Yet busy at his work that Thug must be!
A friend I had I now T no longer see;
Another disappears from his proud place...
No, there is no one there; but for a space
I thought I heard his footsteps after me!
Grim, busy murderer, to me be kind.
I’ll pay your fee; but, pray you, do not
strive
To drag the torture out, just kept alive!
Do your fell job in one squeeze, swift and
tight!
Soft-footed Thug, creep noiselessly behind —
One quick, thick clutch.... and wmlcome,
endless night!
ILLUSION.
Whatever did he see in her? And what
Made her accept him? So we scan a pair
We meet in town —a wife no longer fair,
A husband stodgy, with his dreams forgot;
A STICKY PAST.
RODOLPHE : “My life is an open hook.”
FLO: “H’m —with a number of pages
gummed together!”
Both settled down, contented with their lot.
Yet to his eyes, she, waiting wifely there,
Is the young bride in Spring-time days
that were.
And she sees in her man no ugly blot.
Incomprehensible to us, that blind
Acceptance of the sterile facts of life;
But Nature in her projects grim is kind.
And when the child was coming, like all
men,
To him her figure was a girl's again ;
He saw no ugh’ness in his own wife.
SELF.
So, looking back upon my little life,
I did the galley-work I had to do;
I dreamed fine dreams —and some came
almost true.
I failed but never faltered in the strife.
Fate picked for me the wonder of a wife.
I broke my hundred, learnt to follow
through ;
I built high verse, and made a book or two
That will escape, perhaps, Death’s futile
knife. ,
I have loved much the magic of the word
And known myself a momentary God.
Three children —each around my old
heart curls!
They’ll carry on the drab path I have trod.
And, shackled to my oar, I’ve not demurred ;
And kissed, I reckon, fifty-seven girls!

Fenella West.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Ch ENELDA WEST is seventy-eight;
A She lives alone, alone ;
The rosemary beside her gate
Has tall and straggling grown.
Her husband and her sons are dead-'
Her girl across the sea
Dwells with the foreign man she wed •
So all alone is she.
The waves die out in foamy sighs
A stone’s throw from her wall;
Above her roof with eerie cries
The wheeling seagulls call.
Her neighbors far on left and right
For sandy saltbush miles
Ask: “Don’t the winds blow shrill at nighf?”
“Oh, yes,” she says and smiles.
Fenella by the waters blue
Finds driftwood for her fire;
She picks the little -shells up, too,
And lingers to admire
Their pink and fluted frailty,
Their shining yellow wings.
“I’ve time to look at them,” says she
“The pretty, pretty things !”
So old, so queer, she must be mad.
The neighbors shake their heads:
“That rosemary is dark and sad,
But to your garden-beds
It brings back memories treasured well.
You poor Fenella West.”
“Oh, yes.” she says, “it’s good to smell-
But I like my roses best.”
fihe holds her mouth up to the sun,
Throws kisses to the rain ;
.Sim greets the beauties one by one
That wake each morn again.
“I’ve always wanted to stand still
And watch awhile,” says she,
Drinking at last to deepest fill
Leisure and privacy.
Fenella draws her curtain brown
When sunset’s glow is spent,
And by her bit of fire sits down
And sighs for sheer content.
While from the driftwood’s golden blaze
Soft purple flamelets wreathe:
“I’ve lived for others all my days.
But now I’ve time to breathe!”

The Passing of Dr. Devine.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
SOME people—invariably young people
—regard old age as an unpleasant
draught to be taken at the close of
the banquet of life. Old Dr. Devine smiled
pityingly at them this morning. Why, only
since he retired had he had time to really
enjoy life! He had risen with the sun, as
was Iris custom the year round. He had
enjoyed his bath and his exercises, enjoyed
the spare breakfast that suited his require-
ments. He surveyed the day outside, where
a weak sun struggled through clouds after
days of rain, and turned his back on it. He
would take no risks with his bronchial-tubes.
In his study a new-lit fire crackled a -wel-
come. He re-read the chapter of his Memoirs
MUSIC.
he had written last night. Rather good, he
thought, and pondered again on the title—
" Reminiscences of a Quack.” Nothing un-
professional, of course.
He re-read f some press-cuttings he had
made about monkey-gland treatment, and
consigned them to the flames. Thanks be
he wasn’t senile enough to believe all that
lie went through the mail, and spent an
hour skimming the papers. He wu-ote a
letter to the press about the disgraceful
antics of the town electric light, signed it
‘l’ro Bono Publico,” and sealed it with a
“There, that’s settled” air.
He turned over in his mind an essay he
meant to write on Modern Manners, but let
it slide, enticed away by the nurseryman’s
new Spring catalogue that had come with
the mail. lie decided on five new roses for
his collection, and; thought he would make
rather a feature of gladioli that year. He
must see the gardener.
He gloated a little over the remarkably
line dish of Five Crowns die had sent to
his friend Brown. Brown could not grow
apples like those, though he would not —or,
perhaps, being a lawyer, could not—admit
if. He would drop in presently, and. instead
°l taking his defeat like a man, would hide
behind boastful references to the huge melons
lie had grown—as if anyone couldn’t grow
melons!
It was lunch-time before he realised the
morning had slipped away. Still, eating was
one of. the pleasures of life : the pleasure of
an epicure, not a gourmand. The girl in
charge of the house while his daughter was
away, cooked uncommonly well, and he found
occasion gracefully to tell her so.
Then came the business of the afternoon.
I’he sun had triumphed over clouds, making
the day as young Spring. He went up-
stairs and brushed his already immaculate
suit of grey Australian tweed. He put on
a tie of blue that matched his eyes and
brought out the color ir. liis checks. Before
the glass he decided that cheerful tones were
the only ones for the aged: grey hair had
funeral suggestion enough of itself without
framing it in black. All the same, he was
glad his daughter was away. Agnes would
have summed him up in a moment. His
daughter had decided views as to what was
proper for him-—at his age. And the truth
was Dr. Devine, at 76, was in love, hopelessly
in love with a girl. Mona Clark was
librarian at the town library, which, opened
officially at 3 p.m. At 2.30 Dr. Devine was
starting on a ten minutes’ walk to return
a novel he hadn’t read. Moreover, he knew
Mona would be there early because lie was
coming—whatever she might say about dust-
ing and sorting to do. So it wasn’t alto-
gether one-sided.
It was extraordinary that this sweet thing
of 22 should care for him. Dr. Devine de-
cided it represented the triumph of mind
over matter. Of course, the girl had other
suitors. Notably the very rich young man
who cultivated sheep, and whose culture
went no further. And the smart young
lieutenant of the town motor-garage, who
smelt aggressively of what he called ga-as.
Sometimes he thought Mona was weakening
under his unabashable salesman-like
advances; his smartness and his love were
undeniable. But when in some secure hour
the old doctor told her of long-past adven-
tures when he served with the Foreign
Degion, of colorful student nights in old
Montmartre, brimful years in many cities
of the world. Desdemona never hung upon
Othello’s words more rapt than did she.
And when in his rarely-trained voice he read
passionate French poetry to her, he read
also the answering lovelight in her eyes,
though the words were but mistily under-
stood : years were forgotten, the has-been
and the now were interwoven. No longer
the old doctor, he became the gay young stu-
dent soldier. His mellowed understanding
set him on a pedestal above the raw young
suitors who thronged, scorching their wings
at her young beauty’s flame. How it would
end Define asked himself for the thousandth
time. She might end it any time by jilting
him—if it were possible to jilt one who had
no claim and whose age put him hors de
combat from the first. Or he might yet
marry her. and die happily, uselessly, in her
arms a few years hence. His span of life
might be five, perhaps ten. years, if he were
careful of his heart—and his kidneys. Of
course, he could leave her comfortably pro-
vided for—to marry then, perhaps, the young
man with the petrol perfume. The proper
thing would be to take a tour and forget
her. Travel! —when all he wanted was to
he comfortably settled down. A man on alii-
to be inoculated against that sort of thing
at his age. Old fool he was. tossed about
like a bit of driftwood on the tide of the
cosmic urge. He tried to recall some lines:
Oh that a man could live his life -without this thing
at his side:
Without this thing that remembers and hates and
that hurts and is love.
Oh, if only he were 36 instead of 76! Or
if only .Tean had lived. He would have been
saved all this. He felt a sudden childish
desire to cry. Jean—so blessed had been
their thirty years of married life that the
recollection brought involuntarily the words:
Steel true and blade straight
The great artificer fashioned my mate.
Die could not think of Jean as old. Not as
old even as their
middle-aged and
widowed daughter
who kept house for
him. She was so
young-spirited. Yet
the flow T ers had
bloomed on her
grave these many
years. White nar-
cissi, her favorites.
They must need
thinning now.
He stooped and
took from the
garden - border a
blue hyacinth for
his button hole. God,
what memories a
subtle blue flower
could wake! Gath-
ering bluebells with
his sister in Eng-
lish woods; and on
that first boy-visit
t o Switzerland—
there he was,
always harking back! He must shake off
that habit of dotage.
. The quiet country street was very beau-
tiful that golden afternoon. The tonic of
sun after long rain gilded everything. Tiny
flowers starred the grassy sidewalks. Exotic
street trees showed virginal half-fledged
green. Dr. Devine swung his stick jauntily.
Friendly familiar faces greeted him. Grown
Australians, some of them, that he had helped
through colicky, babyhood. Yet he had not
come to make his home in this peaceful place
till he was tired and middle-aged.
From the library-door he caught a glimpse
of silken ankles, exquisite as any immortal-
ised in sculpture. Mona came done the step-
ladder to greet him. A tawny wool coat half
hid a dress of pastel pink. With her lumi-
nous eyes and dawn-clear skin she might
have been Spring poised ready to break from
Winters hold.. A sight at least to make
an old man wish he were young.
Iye got the other volume of Mendes,”
he cried with boyish, eagerness.
only there will be a chance to read
some! she answered.
“Wo make time for the things we really
want, to do.” he said, his eyes seeking his
favorite chair.
Noisily a muddy, battered Ford came up
Main-street. The driver jerked her to a
standstill opposite the Mechanics’ and came
through the gate. Dr. Devine looked an-
noyed. Then the wet mud glistening on the
cal Dr s clothes forced itself upon his vision
Im looking for Dr. Devine,” the new-
comer said.
Dr. Devine came to attention
“Yes!”
The young man reckoned the other’s age
and MGsitstod.
They told mo von didn't «-*>-> v
more. But there’s been an accident at Brav-
don. Dr. Dane’s away, and we’re cut off
from J he other side by flood.”
“What’s the accident?”
“Drive’s collapsed. One man’s pretty bad,
and some more not out yet.”
“I’ll come, of course.”
The assumption that he was too old for
work put him on his mettle.
The youth began again: “I ought to tell
you the road’s not too good. An’ there’s a
bit of a landslide on her. In fact”—bright-
ening at finding the right word —“it’s dan-
gerous.”
“You came by that road?” the doctor
rapped.
"Yes.”
“Well, you and I can go back by it.”
Did this youngster take it for granted he
had more courage than an old soldier; a
EXPLAINED.
BUDGES: "I say, why do those humous always spell 'bird-eage'
until a hyphen'?”
UIGAR: “Why, for us fellows to perch on, of course."
soldier, too, for half a century in the army
of health, where the traditions of the great
profession demanded one must lay down his
comfort and security of life in the service
of the most wretched of his clients?
“Oh, Doctor, must you go!” Mona cried
impulsively. Her face was anxious.
Dr. Devine bowed. His head was held
very high as he walked to the car with his
companion. Not for the most perfect after-
noon in the library would, he have missed
this. Mona, anxious! Mona regarding him
as a hero not past, but present. They called
at his house and packed a bag. Back in the
car the driver “let her out a bit.”
Then they were bumping over villainous
metal or, worse still, ploughing through un-
made road. Further on the road lay under
the sheet of water backed up from the river.
The rights of property as evidenced by taut
wire fences had gone down before deftly-
used wire-cutters, and the car scrambled
and zig-zagged along the sloping uplands till
it seemed the law of gravitation was sus-
pended to prevent a capsize. Then again on
a flat, a trackless flat with a futurist effect
of water and land. The young man reckoned
the little ’bus would swim through all right.
Only, he added thoughtfully, it was all old
mining ground; you never knew when you
might drop on an old shaft. His face was
expressionless as he spoke. But Dr. Devine
found considerable comfort in the reflection
that Australian humor often took that weird
form known as leg-pulling.
The little ’bus did swim through, the
doctor’s clothes now almost as much spat-
tered as his companion’s. Winding steeply
upwards by rough side cuttings around a
bend they came on what looked like a gang
of bushrangers. But no, these men were
waiting there by appointment to help the
car through the landslide. From the face of
the hill whence wet earth had slid over the
side-cutting a gap yawned. Further up were
terraces of cracks where earth masses
trembled, under pressure of ground-watei’, on
the verge of collapse. On the further side of
the slide, looking still wet from a swim, a
draught-horse waited' with tug chains. Re-
lays of broad planks provided a tread for the
car. Somehow horse and engine drew it
safely across.
Efficient, these Australians. He recalled
professional Italian bandits holding up par-
ties in the mountain passes, and reflected
how much better this matter-of-fact gang
could have done it. He rather wished Mona
could have seen that crossing—with particu-
lar reference to the tons of earth that might
at any moment have fallen and demolished
them.
The driver was shaking the car up again
now. Surely this car possessed an almost
human adaptability to environment. A car
de luxe would have developed acute engine
trouble or tyre rupture under such treatment.
But this little runt of a Ford, though it
groaned with mechanical stomach-ache and
sometimes coughed asthmatically, still held
on. Questioned, the driver said the engine’s
internal pain was nothing—just a sort of
habit. She’d do another thousand miles
without a touch of a screwdriver.
They reached the mine. A doctor from
out the other side was there before them —
Dr. Dale, the capable, standardised product
of a modern medical school. He had done
all there was to do. The motor ambulance
would be here any moment now. The cases
were all ready. One man was dead, a young
married man who had gone down to help at
the first sign of danger. And there was an-
other lad still missing.
Nothing to do! It was an anti-climax
after the ride that had keyed him up. That
on-the-shelf feeling gripped him moodily.
Willing laymen would help Dr. Dale move
his patients.
He walked about chatting with profes-
sional cheerfulness. Then a thought struck
him. He would go down. The lad below
might need first aid.
The man at the shaft demurred. Per-
versely Dr. Devine went down. Danger!
The older and less valuable a life was the
more it must bp coddled. The strong young
man in the front trench and the doddering
old politician safe in his armchair 1
Great-muscled, sweating men tore at the
unmanageable sticky earth in the drive,
propping and timbering as they went. They
hadn’t located “him” yet—and the pronoun
somehow indicated a corpse.
Again nothing to do —for such decrepit
man-power as his! And he had almost a
phobia of being underground. Yet it was
safe enough for these men to work in.
Deliberately he walked into the opposite
deserted drive, just as he might have taken
a half-broken colt close to some object it
had shied at. It was a higher level and
drier there. Candle in hand lie walked on—
was it a few yards or two hundred?—through
damp, evil air and blackness that mocked
liis single candle.
Tool - sound a n d
voice from the tun-
nel behind seemed
to intensify th e
silence around. But
he went on.
Then a sound
wave —was it bat
or human or some
earth vibration ?■—
reached him. Ter-
ror gripped him in
the dark, poised
his trembling limbs
for flight. But some
stronger, undefin-
able power held
him, drove him for-
ward, step by
trembling step, with
a strange black
viscid fluid grip-
ping his feet. Then,
again, and nearer,
a moan of human
pain. That was
something tangible;
something he under-
stood. He pressed
forward through
the deepening mud
and held his light
high. A blur of
color came into
vie w. Then he
made out a dun-
garee - clad form
lying partly in a
mud-drift. Even as he looked the drift
seemed to move. Beyond the drive seemed
blocked from top to bottom —and the mass
was moving slowly, yet gathering speed as
a mass of treacle tipped from a tin might,
gather impetus from the weight behind. It
was slipping—-the drive they said was all
right! And the boy was helpless here.
How far was it back? He could hear no-
thing now. They wo nid never hear if he
called. Why should he call? To bring
more strong young men to their death? In
five minutes the boy might be smothered —•
in less perhaps. The loathsome black pug
seemed to assume huge and fiendish facial
expressions as it came gurgling on, strangling
arms reaching towards them.
The lad was slight-built for his years.
Concentrating all his strength—summoning
surely some from bygone years—Dr. Devine
lifted the boy. Somehow, candle in mouth,
he got him on to his back and turned to re-
trace his mire-weighted steps. Was there
time? The mass seemed to be racing at
them now, sinister, noiseless. Terror lent
him strength. Was it gaining on them? He
dared not pause to look. He heard odd, faint,
hissing noises.... Then a roaring, rushing,
Was it in the drive or only the pounding in
his ears?.... Could he hold out—with this
terrible weight 1... . What a deatli —to be
buried in That!... . What did he tell pati-
ents with worn-out hearts like his? No ex-
citement. .. .no exertion. What did it matter
if he did wear his old heart out? What was
his withered life worth? Some power had
led him to find that boy. If he died doing
something worth while, Mona would know.
OVERSTEPPING HER RESOURCES.
YVONNE: “Maybelle seems under a great
strain."
YVETTE: “Yes, she’s falling in love with her
next husband."
He would live immortalised in Mona’s heart
—instead of dying in bed a broken old thing
to be forgotten.
He staggered on, his muscles on a rack of
agony, the noise of stormy seas in his ears.
Mona ! Mona! He held the name as though
drawing impalpable life and strength from
it. Mona! He was shouting now.
A faint glow of light ahead. A man’s form
silhouetted....then another and another....
and a moment later the old doctor lay face
down on the drive.
Up in the light of day again the miners
talked in puzzled whispers.
“He couldn’t ha’ done it,” the Cornish
foreman kept repeating. “That old, poor man
couldn’t ha’ done it. It’s speerits, speerits,
tha's what it is.”
Old Dr. Devine lay dead on the grass, his
jaunty grey suit massed with mud. But his
lifeless blue eyes held triumph, the triumph
of an actor leaving a well-loved stage amidst
coveted applause.
FRANCE MURPHY.

Magill of Gulgolong.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
OH, many’s the tale I’ve heard o’ nights,
with a hard day’s punting done,
Of the famed and the fast of days
long past and of races bravely run,
But never a tale like the old man told when
he asked, where beer-pumps throng,
“Did ycr ever hear tell of what befell Magill
of Gulgolong?”
Slowly he stroked his ancient beard and a
red, red eye cocked he
O’er the rim of a “pot” ; it smouldered hot
as the sun on a rim of the sea;
And slowly he spoke and soft he spoke, but
his voice was somehow shrill,
Like the harrowing wail of a banshee pale
in the heart of a lonely hill.
“It’s little enough ye think, I know, and,
it’s little enough ye hear
Of the men, like fates, who set the weights,
though they are the men to fear,
For what is pleasure to punters, lad, to a
handicapper’s pain.”
It was this that he said, with nodding head,
like the beat of a sad refrain.
“Ay, they are the men who count, my lad,
though it’s likely you’ll forget,
As they sit like gods above the odds, un-
moved by fume or fret;
And we’ll welcome another Carbine yet and
travel far along
Or ever ye meet with one to beat Magill of
Gulgalong.
“For no horse-knowledge that science has to
Magill w T as unbeknown ;
Like the chant of a creed he’d recite you
breed for every hide and bone;
Performances best and least he’d learned and
could quote you book and verse,
With ne’er a let-up from Melbourne Cup to
the smallest country purse.
“And wary and warier he became, while
punters fared but ill,
For they seldom could get the puzzles set
in the weights of Sam Magill;
And bookies their hearts could open then
and so well his work was done,
In a field of five, as I’m alive, ’twould be
nine to two bar none.
“And ever to wider fame he won, but con-
tent could never feel,
For astride of Magill was ambition still
and it rode him, hand and heel;
And nothing he recked of pomp and power,
and little of life or death,
But to better his best was still the quest
that he f jught with every breath.
“Now. richest of all our races run w T as the
Gulgolong Gold Cup,
When the horses came down from Sydney
town with the smartest jockeys up;
And this for his masterpiece Magill had in
tended many a day,
And he gave it the whole of his heart and
soul as only an artist may,
“Oh, many a dreary day he spent on this
greatest work of all,
From the earliest light until latest night he
could hear no other call;
And many a w T eary mile he sped on the track
of an entry new;
There was never a hint of a hidden sprint
but Magill was there to view.
“And well I recall the wild dismay when the
weights at last appeared.
For it seemed like the scheme of a madman's
dream; how the city papers cheered
The nerve of this hayseed handicapper, who
(quite beyond all bounds)
Gave his estimates of the horses’ weights
in ounces as icell as pounds!
“They called him the ‘Gulgolong Galoot’ and
inquired about his ‘store,’
Where he probably weighed the marmalade
to a grain, nor less nor more:
Such fun, they declared, had ne’er been heard.
and tremendous was the chaff
At the fearless skill of ‘the Great Magill’
—oh, the sports had many a laugh,
“The best of his friends denied him then as
the best of friends oft may,
But never a word from Magill was heard as
he went his lonely way.
Six pounds and thirteen ounces more for a
penalty he gave
To the filly Rehearse when she won the Purse
at a meeting at Baldygrave.
“Thirteen to the startpr’s hands there were
when at last the great day came,
And the sun set alight their jackets bright in
a blur like a dancing flame.
Away to an even break they went in a line
that was wondrous trim,
And Magill, all alone, stood turned to stone,
and his face was white and grim.
“They thundered along the liome-stretch like
a charging cavalry troop,
And away at the back the dipping track
nearly hid the even group,
While paler and paler grew Magill and the
stands about him reeled.
For the peneillers still were loud and shrill
with their ‘Ten to one the field.’
“So fast to the turn they sprinted, as the
spurs began to sting.
And the loudest of men was silent then, and
silent was the ring.
Till a sound like a mighty sob was heard
from the Flat to the farthest hill.
And the race was done; but likewise run was
the race of Sam Magill.
“All reverently they lifted him from the dust
where still he lay,
But of pain on his face they found no trace,
just the smile of a child at play.
Ah, happy the man whom death attends
with a triumph so complete!
Nor a first nor a last the judge had cast —
9 tie,as a thirteen times dead-heat /”
* * * *
Now, this was the tale that the old man told
on a night in a noisy bar,
While it suddenly seemed that his red eye
gleamed on a phantom shape afar;
And slow to the beat of his nodding head
came his words like a Avistful song—
“lt is still at the Post, the restless ghost
of Magill of Gulgolong.”
VICTORIA.
HASEN.
The Candidate and the
Chorus.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THESE events took place in England
during the heated and memorable
election campaign in the year nineteen
hundred and drinky-free. I left that coun-
try soon after —I might almost say that I
left immediately after.
The persons involved included, of course,
Deeimus Shuckberg, who was large, reddish
and violent, and hated John Drayson in the
way that was natural to him, because he
seemed to hate everybody. There would have
been no story but for Shuckberg. Then
there was Drayson, who was tall, handsome
and polite, and had no passionate objection
to anybody except Shuckberg, though he
spared some dislike for the servile and color-
less Eggett, because Eggett was Shuckberg’s
secretary and shadow. I brought Classon in,
because he was a capable actor, mimic and
elocutionist, the right size, and a man of
parts, though managers were shy of giving
him one by reason of a popular Infirmity.
In addition to the fact that he seemed admir-
ably suited to my purpose, I wrnnted him to
earn more money, so that he might borrow
less. Tully was a smaller edition of Classon,
a capable man, and Classou’s understudy
in the matter of the Infirmity.
My tendency to the amateur dramatic
life had made me acquainted with various
half-waifs and semi-strays like Classon and
Tully. From the athletic side of my exist-
ence, and from a town removed from the
focus of activity, I gathered up four fourth-
rate and impecunious bruisers of the least
possible intelligence, to form a Chorus. They
were the old type, with a tendency to back-
sliding foreheads, hands like kosher hams,
and bandy feet. They had one idea among
them. I discovered its existence just when
I had too many other matters on my mind.
When my office was inundated with enough
business to be visible, I was in the habit of
giving temporary employment to Ferdinand
Spiller, who did agency work and canvassing,
and I engaged him to supervise the Chorus
as a matter of course. He brought along
his nephew, young Clarence Spiller, without
my knowledge or consent, to assist and run
messages, and though Clarence appeared £
mere shaving on the surface of the torrent
of events, he proved the timely circumstance
which staved off a catastrophe. The owner
of the deserted worsted factory, .Tupp by
name, wasn’t cast for any part. I would
have preferred to rent the premises openly
and pay for them honestly, though not with
my own money, just as Guy Fawkes would
probably have preferred to trade openly in
gunpowder and have the telephone laid on
for business purposes; but the case called
for a lurking secrecy which was foreign to
my sunny nature. Jupp never even knew
that I had borrowed his building. Some
1000 or 500 other folk played minor char-
acters as audience, committee-men, rioters
and lay figures. By way of introducing my-
self, I will merely mention that I am gradu-
ally resuming my rightful name, which is
Driggs.
Shuckberg and Drayson were in the same
line. Each owned a collection of provincial
newspapers. Success had come to each when
he was still young enough to enjoy it. Dray-
son was rich and a generous sportsman, with
a love of adventure. Shuckberg was richer,
because he never gave anything away, and
morose like the crocodile, which must have been
his ancestor. In early days, they had been
partners in their first paper, and Drayson
had been robbed of a decent fortune. He
wasted no money in legal proceedings, and
showed no serious signs of resentment, save
that after the dissolution of the firm was
completed, he carried his ex-colleague around
the office by the nose. At least a legend
persisted to that effect, and the nose certainly
might have looked more natural than it did.
A MAN OF AFFAIRS.
THE CAPTAIN (buying his liquor): “And —
ah —would you maind—ah —wrapping it
up so as it maight appeah laike a pair
of stays?"
The feud burned on through the years, some-
times dying down for lack of new fuel, and
anon blazing up again when Deeimus Shuck-
berg thought out a new unpleasantness. A
climax came when Drayson took a fancy
to go into politics, and began to angle rather
too languidly for the Liberal-Prohibition
nomination for Bishampton, near to Blue-
hampton, where he had his headquarters.
Shuckberg learned of the business early, and
I suppose the fact that he was little known
personally in the locality helped him in the
subsequent negotiations. The underground
engineering must have been masterly, and
the expenditure was probably heartbreaking
to a man of his adhesive nature, but he
secured the nomination, and announced that
he would found a new paper, in Drayson s
own town, to push his candidature and the
Liberal-Prohibition interest. He invented a
new patent sneer in the process of making
the announcement.
Busiuess was worse than ever, and life
was flat, and a profitable adventure was
needed. I waylaid Drayson and asked him
if money would be any object provided
Shuckberg’s public career was turned into
a thing of scorn and laughter, that it proved
to be sudden dust and immediate ashes, that
he became one of the world's, jests and mys-
teries, and that, in short, he committed poli-
tical suicide on his own platform. The genial
sportsman replied that, up to a certain
number of thousands, money would be no
object, especially if the proceedings were
humorous, for gloom and tragedy were un-
pleasant and the world required brightening.
The final agreement was that he would
provide the sum I considered necessary, which
MEETING HIM HALF-WAY.
STOREKEEPER: “You owe me flirty bob, Jacky, but vie bin make myself good fellow and
knock off ten shilling."
JACKY: “Boss, me bin make myself good p fella, too, and knock off nudder ten tchillin’."
was liberal, for expenses, and a large dona-
tion, which would reach me through an un-
known channel, immediately after the fall, if
Shuckberg fell the whole way. If he fell
only part of the way, the remuneration would
still be very handsome.
In such a matter the making of the plan is
usually the supreme trouble. Not so with
me. All the broad outlines and many of the
minor details were embodied in a work of
mine, written during a bygone period of
literary fervor, in which the disappearances
included a king, a gem of great price, and an
express train which left one station and
never arrived at the next, though years
rolled on, if the express didn’t. It took only
a trifle of adaptation to fit the case of the
king and the express train to the matter in
hand.
I spent the available days in organising a
small but capable force, in inspecting Jupp’s
worsted factory, wdiicli was an ideal place,
for it was not only deserted but located in
a decayed outskirt of a decayed townlet, and
in renewing my knowledge of Shuckberg’s
habits. He had changed in the way of in-
creasing resemblance to the plain every-day
wolf of commerce, but he was still the same
stingy darling as of old, and left or returned
to his suburban mansion per tram and two
lengthy feet to save a motor-car. Also, I
considered in all its bearings the 60 miles of
road between his town of Henborough and
his prospective constituency of Bishampton.
* * * *
The objectionable candidate was to open
his campaign in Bishampton Town Ilall at
8 o’clock on a December evening, which
proved to be like the miserable family of
December evenings. A little after 4, when the
sun was down, and a thin mist was drifting
here and there like a homeless ghost, the
Chorus mildly kidnapped Shuckberg and his
secretary outside the great man’s own gate,
when they were leaving economically for the
station. ' This saved the danger of sand-
bagging them in the train and throwing them
out, or the serious risk of kidnapping them
out of the very bosom of the Liberal-
Prohibition committee on arrival. In this
easy overcoming of the first and worst diffi-
culty 1 recognised the hand of Pate, and a
sign that Providence was on our side. Hav-
ing had the advantage of a pious upbringing
in childhood, I was naturally elated. Shuck-
berg was seized by the clutching hands of
melodrama from behind. A clutching towel
was tied over his mouth. There was a short,
tempestuous struggle conducted in the air,
for the Chorus had hoisted its prey off his
feet lest the drumming of his heels on the
pavement should make an unseemly disturb-
ance, and then all parties were in the waiting
car, including private-secretary Eggett,
whom one of the choristers had captured with
his spare hand. Ferdinand Spiller material-
ised imperceptibly out of the shadows and sat
beside me, and I took the wheel and hit the
road, or at least the high places thereof.
Possibly no vehicle was more crowded be-
fore or since. Its contents consisted of two
captives, one of them bulky; four heavy-
weight mercenaries, a robust free fight, and
an odor of brimstone from the candidate’s
thoughts, which hung like a cloud. The in-
side of the car began to resemble a city after
the Hun occupation. At one moment, before
he began to weary, Shuckberg, standing on
his head, got both feet out of the window,
and would have made a vulgar scene if it
had been daylight. When we drove into the
yard attached to Jupp’s mill and proceeded
to unload by lantern light, he was still vio-
lently unreasonable, and refused to go down
to the cellar provided for him. Eggett went
to his apartment with only enough resistance
to show that he registered a protest, but there
were unseemly disorders and orgies on the
stairway before his employer was comfort-
ably fastened into a chair which in its turn
was moored to the floor lest it should De
stolen. The climax was reached when
Classon, already made up as a speaking like-
ness of Shuckberg, stepped in and proceeded
to look Shuckberg over by the light of a lan-
tern, that he might decide if any finishing
touches were necessary. The towel had to be
removed because Classon desired to inspect
Shuckberg’s teeth, and this opened a field for
vituperation which was marvellous in its
finish. When Classon brought in Tully,
made up as Eggett, to advise regarding the
teeth, the candidate passed all bounds. After
we left. Ferdinand Spiller made the Chorus
unfasten him, but took away his clothes _as
a precaution. His boots remained to him,
and he was locked in, with a stretcher, blan-
kets, a candle, and some food and alcohol
for company. But before I left one of the
Chorus balanced up to me and said:
“I say, governor, what blinkin’ house is
this, and what’s the name of the bally vil-
lage?”
I gave him the name of a bally village Jo
miles the other side of Henborough, but his
curiosity made me uneasy. My four merce-
naries were paid not to be curious.
There was another hiatus to be filled m,
and it had come periliously close to drop-
ping out of mind. I drove back to a half-way
town and telephoned to Shuckberg’s chair-
man, in the name of Eggett, that my em-
ployer was on the way per car, with a valued
friend or two, and despite unforeseen difficul-
ties he was guaranteed to arrive in time. If
the committee had gone to the station to
meet the candidate* and had then reported
his vanishment and postponed the meeting,
it would have been an unpardonable fiasco.
After all this scene-fixing and stage-
setting, the curtain rose. We reached the
old-fashioned Bishampton Town Hall too
late for any private conference with the com-
mittee, and the principals stalked to the
front—Classon as Shuckberg, and looking
as bounding and truculent as that nuisance
did in ordinary life, but not so bad as he did
when undressed in the cellar; Tully as
Eggett, and not quite so well made up as
Classon „• myself and Spiller performing in-
definitely in the back distance. I carefully
avoided a place on the platform, and seated
myself at the end of a row close to the door,
so that Clarence might approach me unobtru-
sively with news (if any). The chairman
prosed at length while I raged inwardly at
the delay in getting to real business, but at
last he was out of the way, and the deck
was clear for action. Then Classon arose,
balanced on his heels, and hiccoughed thrice
for all he was worth. According to my stage
directions he was only to hiccough once to
begin with. I had a sudden apprehension
that he had been drinking the Infirmity
again. The audience sat spellbound while
the candidate murmured something about
“indigestion” and “sausages.” Then he
plunged brightly into speech with only an
occasional hitch.
“Miss Chairman, ladies and gentleman, our
late member is no more. He never was much,
and now he is less. There is no family claim
on the seat, as the late member came of a
family in which there have been no children
for some generations, and the only descen-
dant he left behind him is an uncle, who died
ten years ago. I believe there was nothing
suspicious about the uncle’s death —not that
the police ever reported. In the circum-
stances, I have butted in. I mean that in
response to great pressure I have consented
to uphold the party banner and carry h
headlong to victory. You’d be surprised to

know how much of the blooming pressure I
supplied myself.”
The speech I had prepared, and which
Classon had rehearsed, was wild enough, but
the candidate was improving on it already.
His interpolations were good, but the
audience might grow restive too early. The
atmosphere of airy persifl-age was being-
decanted rather suddenly. Still, there were
at least a dozen representatives of Shuck-
berg’s chain of newspapers at the front, and
they were bound to rally round their pay-,
master before his disguise was torn off. That
versatile gentleman took an immense drink
of water, threw back his shoulders, and hit
up the pace like a giant refreshed.
“I am not unknown or inexperienced in
public life. In my own town I served for
a year as mayor a long time ago, and I was
so popular that I was unanimously
elected ex-mayor next year. I have filled
that important office ever since. You have
doubtless heard of my activities. No politi-
cal or philanthropic sliivoo of any sort was
complete without me. I was the principal
founder of our Home for Improbables”
“Incurables, Mr. Shuckberg,” interposed
Tully.
“I said Impossibles, didn’t I?” said the can-
didate in sudden anger.
“Incurables, Mr. Shuckberg,” repeated
Tully, with mild insistence.
“Well, as I was saying,” resumed the
candidate, with a return to good temper, “I
put up most of the oof for this Home for
Aged and Infirm Impostors, which was a
huge structure of brick, built in Tudor
architecture, though there was a devil of a
lot of doors in it. Then it was me that got
Socialist literature admitted to the municipal
library. And I was the cause of the wonder-
ful artificial lake in the town park. It had
a smooth surface, the same as you see on the
galoons of Venice if you go there. The worst
of it was that this rekerky work of art blocked
the traffic, and we had to make a subway
under it, so that the traffic wouldn’t be
blocked, but bless your souls, the subway
leaked like the deuce, and women got their
hats ruined, and caught cold through mud
trickling down their backs, and in the end
the subway fell in. Then we made a cause-
way across the lake to carry the traffic, and
then we made another causeway to carry
more traffic, and at last we filled up the lake.
It was nothing but. a dashed silly nuisance
anyway. I showed the place where the lake
had stood to his Royal Highness the Prince of
Wales when he came to the town to open
the statue of his father, him that’s dead
now. His Royal Highness gave way to emo-
tion, and said he had never seen anything
like it, and never expected to.”
Classon was plainly enjoying himself,
which was a mistake. The .man he was
■impersonating never wore a happy expression.
The chairman got half on to his feet with
a dazed look, but sat down without inter-
fering. At this moment, an obviously
troubled Clarence Spiller beckoned me out.
He had sped per car from Jupp’s factory,
eight miles awmy, with news of dire import.
Two of the Chorus had gone out in search
of drink, and hadn’t returned. The other
two were mutinous and demanded that liquor
should be [brought in, otherwise they would
leave also.!
This, to" quote a character in my drama,
was a blowi of the deepest dye. I had intended
that, after the meeting had dispersed, Shuck-
berg should be re-clothed, and that he and
Eggett should be taken back in the dark and
abandoned not far from the place where we
picked them up. They were to be intoxi-
cated if possible, wholly ignorant of the
whereabouts of the scene of their detention,
and with only their uncorroborated narrative
to show that they had spent the night pri-
vately in a cellar instead of publicly on a
Town Hall platform. The whole military

everybody!"
strength of the Chorus might be required to
carry out this great movement, and behold,
the Chorus was a broken reed. The two
absentees might even now be babbling in
strange beerhouses, also learning a great deal
too much about the lay of the country. With
an effort I pulled myself together and gave
money and instructions to Clarence, who was
watching me with a look of dog-like fidelity
in his eyes. He was to take back fair words
and assorted drinks (and I didn’t mind if
he took back strychnine as well) for the
two remaining stalwarts. Then he was to
scour the district in an endeavor to find and
recapture the deserters. Clarence saluted
automatically (he had been once a pure-
minded hoy scout; I don’t know what he is
now), and left at speed.
Back in the hall, I was pleased to find
signs of growing dissatisfaction. If Classon
failed to create ample dissatisfaction his mis-
sion was a frost. Many people were leaving.
Others murmured, but so far the ringing
voice of the orator dominated everything.
The man next me told me that Mr. Shuckberg
must have gone mad or taken poison to do
what he had just done. I demanded eagerly
if it was anything serious. It appeared that
our candidate, in the midst of a dissertation
THE REASON WHY.

POCUS : “Well, it's like this. I knew the wife had a sewing-machine, and that it was
sure to have an oilcan, and my office-door used to squeak abominably.”
on woman suffrage, had stopped to pour out
his fifth drink. The carafe became empty,
however, when the glass was half-full, and
with a snort of disgust he had pulled a
flask from his pocket, and made good the
deficiency with a rich brown liquid. Then
he had drunk the potion at a draught. “And
him said to be a lifelong abstainer, too,”
wailed my informant. “If he didn’t own
two millions and a dozen newspapers, some
of the folks here would drag his ear off.
There he goes again.”
Classon was improvising a good deal now,
and though the quips and tags which he
added to the written speech were not bad
so far, I feared that he might degenerate into
ribaldry at any moment. There would be a
difficult time ahead, when the speech came
to its legitimate conclusion and the candi-
date sat down, and the chairman rose to
propose a vote of thanks or horror or some-
thing, and the committee gathered round the
pseudo-Sliuckberg to shake his hand, or shake
their fists in his face, or shake the dust of
the Liberal-Prohibitionist committee-room
off their feet, for then the candidate would be
under closer observation than hitherto. If
the meeting would break up in disorder it
might be a blessing—not enough disorder to
lead to arrests and inquiries, but sufficient to
sweep Classon and Tully safely off the pre-
mises and into outer darkness.
Clarence liad ar-
rived again, and
obviously desired to
speak to me. He
was pale and agi-
tated, and had not
come, as I fondly
hoped, to tell that
the missing half
of the Chorus had
been re-captured.
Instead, the alarm-
ing news was that
Shuckherg had
absconded out of
the cellar provided
for him, and had
purloined two of
our blankets in the
process. Ferdinand
Spiller had been
struck by the fact
that the silence in
the cellar was long
and profound, and
with the support of
the remaining
Chorus he had
opened the door
and discovered the
defalcation. Be-
cause of his crimi-
nal neglect of duty,
he was quite un-
able to say how r
long his charge
had been away. He
had discovered a
chimney at the far
end of the apart-
ment, and assumed
that the late in-
mate, by a display
of unexpected
agility, had left
by that road. The
remaining half of
the Chorus was showing symptoms of panic,
and prompt instructions were wanted —not
foolish instructions, but something lit for an
overwhelming emergency.
The problem remained. How long would
it take a person, pursuing the elusive tac-
tics natural to the sketchily clad, to dis-
cover where he was, to discover a
police-station, to convince the sluggish
minion in charge that he was a million-
aire and not a madman, to avoid being locked
up, and to get the law into motion? Perhaps
he would find some quicker method than ap-
plication to the police. I should have fore-
seen the chance, however shadowy, of an
escape, and had a minion with a Scotch
accent lurking outside to answer the fugi-
tive’s questions, and put him on a false
scent by assuring him that the town ahead
wms Edinburgh, and that Jupp’s factory was
the ruins of liolyrood. That might at least
have gained a little time.
Anyhow, Clarence had to have his instruc-
tions. I gave him the only ones I could
think of, also most of the money I had about
me. His uncle was to load swiftly into the
motor-car stretchers, blankets, candles, rem-
nants of food and drink and tobacco, and all
other traces of occupation. He was to brush
away as many footmarks as possible. He
was to load up Eggett, in strict custody of
the two Choristers, and Eggett was to pre-
serve a dead silence, whether Eggett was
dead or alive. The course was to be south-
westerly, because the least population lay
in that direction. At some auspicious hour
the miserable but undeserving secretary was
to be abandoned, with one shilling for his
immediate necessities, in the Forest of Arden
or Birnam Wood or some such place. After
that I left it to the ingenuity of Ferdinand
Spiller to get home with the car and not
carry the Choristers along with him.
Clarence I directed to seize by hook or by
crook a motor-bike or a push-bike (if no-
thing better could be had), and to patrol the
road by which the enemy would almost cer-
tainly approach if lie came. Just as the
faithful youth was getting the car into
motion, a broad policeman drifted across the
street with the plain intention of having an
interview. He was too late by reason of his
constitutional apathy, but he looked after
the vehicle and considered the number. This
rather pleased me, for it had been copied
from the plate of an archdeacon. Then he
remarked to me that he would “like to have
a look at that kid’s license.” His words
gave me the cold feeling of one who has
dodged an avalanche, and he was big enough
for one. Whatever document Clarence was
carrying he didn’t look old enough to have
come by it honestly, and if he and the vehicle
had been detained on suspicion the whole
edifice of crime and deceit might have fallen,
the same as Siloam’s tower, on our heads.
And there were plenty of heads.
I hung about as inconspicuously as pos-
sible, waiting for the next emergency. Look-
ing through a window, I discovered that the
audience had thinned down remarkably, and
even a number of committee-men had left.
Those w'ho remained were tired and dazed.
So far as I could see in a badly-lighted local-
ity, the deserters had made no specific
gathering outside with a view to mobbing the
departing candidate. Still it was satisfac-
tory to know that both he and Tully had
been fully apprised concerning the rear .exits.
The Town Hall was a dim, antiquated struc-
ture with back-number lighting arrange-
ments, which might he all to the good. Re-
connoitring through a side doorway that
opened from a narrow paved alley, it proved
that the speaker’s water-bottle had been
partly replenished, and, to judge from the
color of the refreshment therein, Classon had
poured the remaining contents of the flask,
and the balance of Shuckberg's reputation for
abstinence, into it. Provided he was running
to schedule, which might or might not be
the case, he had about ten minutes’ material
left, but he had banked the fires of his fury
and w T as spinning out his periods. Evidently
lie was in hopes that the rest of the audience
would quit and clear his line of retreat. But
I realised with alarm that his make-up was
in a dangerous state of decay. In the heat
and recklessness born of drink and exces-
sive speed, he had probably wiped it too
often. By reason of dangers within and
without, a sudden ringing-down of the cur-
tain was called for, and just as I had decided
this, the goddess of fortune in the shape of
a big man, who could be nothing else but a
greengrocer, took the matter out of my
hands. He started for the platform with a
gruff shout:
“Oh, I’m full up of this. Let’s chuck the
blighter out of the window.”
It . was a small, half-hearted rush that
followed ; but a candidate whose complexion
was coming off couldn’t stand rough usage,
especially when his bitterest enemy might
arrive nude from a cellar at any moment.
I reached the gas-meter in the back regions
with six long strides, and left the hall in
darkness. Then I broke a window, shrieked
“Murder!” in a falsetto voice, added a pierc-
ing cry of “Sauve qui pent" and made my
retreat. If Classon and Tully failed to take
that hint, I had at least done my best for
them. And the other thread of the con-
spiracy required looking to.
But that boy-genius Clarence appeared on
a motor-bike, and hills of care were lifted
off my head. Either Shuckberg bad not gone
to any police-station, out of shame at his
condition or for fear of detention, or else he
had gone and been chased away as a mounte-
bank. Anyhow, he was not bearing down
on Bisliampton in a police motor filled with
officers of the law. Clarence had identified
him by street-lamp light as approaching in a
buggy of low degree, drawn by a slow horse,
though, if language could have made a horse
fast, it would have beaten the wind. I was
never able to account for Shuckberg’s pos-
session of this outfit, but he probably found
it grazing outside an inn and commandeered
it. He was quite capable of such an act.
So far as Clarence could see, he was dressed
in mixed attire—the sort that a person of
criminal instincts might acquire by robbing
belated clothes-lines. He was trying to pass
off the blankets he had removed from Jupp’s
worsted mill for a fashionable overcoat. His
object, as I unerringly divined, was to reach
Bisliampton Town Hall, be identified and
certified to by his election committee, and
then let his vengeful passions loose. The
lamps of his buggy had gone out, so Clarence
had pushed ahead, and notified the first
policeman lie met that he was pursued by a
suspicious character driving furiously with-
out lights. The complication which the force
thereupon created took so long to sort out
that Bisliampton had gone to bed, and was
nearly ready to rise again, before Shuckberg
arrived, and the effect of his entry was quite
spoiled. Furthermore, he was too late to
influence the press. The efforts of his own
papers to put matters in a satisfactory light
showed the want of a guiding hand.
* * * *
Drayson paid me lavishly as a sign that
he regarded the downfall of Shuckberg as
complete, and dropped my acquaintance as
an indication that he regarded my methods
as not those of a sportsman or a high-minded
English gentleman. He was quaintly con-
servative in some things. I resumed convey-
ancing and other odd business in my one-
man office with my best air of unconcern, and
kept an eye on events. The police had the
matter in hand, but it struck me that
they were rather apathetic, perhaps for fear
of tracing the crime, if there had been one,
to tlie Tory candidate, who was deservedly
popular, despite his politics, and a soldier of
many decorations. Theories there were in
plenty. One was that Shuckberg had himself
hired Classon and Tully to fill a gap, while
lie went in pursuit of one of the sordid amours
in which a man with his criminal expression
would naturally wallow. His dilapidated
condition in the buggy would be easily ex-
plained if he had been detected and dragged
all over the premises by the lady’s male rela-
tives, and then cast adrift.
A theory which was at least equally in
favor for a moment was that the man on the
platform was the genuine candidate and that
the man in the buggy, who was detained for
driving without lights, was an impostor and
an impersonator. It was held by this
school of thought that Shuckberg, wine being-
in and the cloak of hypocrisy being out, had
spoken liis true sentiments for the first time.
Then realising his mistake when he sobered
up, and especially when he fled through the
NO CAUSE FOR ALARM.
“The only thing I'm frightened about Jack
is that he might change."
“Don't worry, you'll never find any change
about him.”
back door with liis secretary to avoid being
mauled and perhaps skull-dragged by the
assembled Liberal-Prohibitionists, he had
hastily dressed up an accomplice to tell an
improbable tale of absence and insult, and
had sent Eggett away to a distance so that
his discovery there should serve as corrobora-
tion. This theory quickly gave way to the
simpler one that Shuckberg was both men.
When he fled from the Town Hall with a
dismal realisation of his blunder, he found
he hadn’t time to hire and paint an accom-
plice, so he changed his clothes in the buggy
with the slow horse, and impersonated him-
self. Being asked what he had done with
the other clothes, some moderate well-wishers
said he had given them away to the poor,
but confirmed ill-wishers said that was im-
possible, as he never gave away anything,
and the shock would have been fatal. On
the other hand, those who alleged that there
had been a duplicate Shuckberg were in-
vited to produce the duplicate, and their
failure to do so told against them. The mass
of public opinion, however, decided that the
speech was genuine whether the person who
delivered it was or not, and Shuckberg’s poli-
tical aspirations fell flat.
But one day I saw a changed Shuckberg in
the street. The habitual magnate didn’t
regard me at all. This one fixed on me a
gaze of smouldering and fish-like hate that
spoke of the wickedness of the soul within.
And that same day I received an anonymous
letter bidding me “bewerr” for something
“wurse then deth” was being prepared for
me. I imagined from the literary style that
some of the Chorus had been bought or
intimidated and *had entered the enemy’s
service, but with a lingering spark of fidelity
had sent me a warning.
So I departed unobtrusively at an hour’s
notice. The business (conveyancing and odds
and ends) in my little office was not much
loss, and the weather that winter was de-
pressing enough to account for anybody’s
departure.

Night Watch.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
ONE eve I lay thinking, awake in my
bunk,
< )f girls I had fancied, of drinks I had drunk,
Of tracks I had travelled and seas I had
sailed,
The friends who were left me, the friends
who had failed,
Of money I’d lost and of money I’d won,
Ana the dead days came mocking me one by
one.
Asleep, I fell dreaming of crafts and their
crews,
Till plainly I saw 7 them deep down in the
ooze,
The lost ships of ages; aye, millions of tons,
All sunk in deep water where no current
runs.
Their spars and their yards stood as rigid
as steel,
And never a quiver from maintruck to keel.
Beslimed was their cordage; all matted with
weed
The sails that had vaunted their glory of
speed—
The moon-litten canvas that silent and white
Crept up o’er the waters like clouds in the
night
When binnacle lamps threw a dull, ruddy
glint
On faces of steersmen with knuckles of flint,
And quid-chewing lookouts spat, furtive, to
lee,
With night watches ready to furl or to free.
They rode to short anchors, encrusted and
red,
That held them and kept them deep down on
the bed
Of silent, dark places. No sunny green shore
With long combers breaking they’d make
evermore.
The green waves above them might laugh in
the light,
But theirs was the port of Perpetual Night.
Weighed down by the pressure of waters
where dwell
But eyeless sea-creatures and aimless sea
shell,
They waited and bided, their dark holds to
fill.
Unbroken by tempest, but stricken and still.
These squadrons abysmal so many they
seemed,
They spread beyond counting; but e’en as I
dreamed
I heard the dull bell of a lost ship that tolls
The changing of watches for dead sailors’
souls ;
And soft as the falling of leaves to the earth
They dropped down below and came up from
the berth.
The ghosts of grim mates, and the ghosts of
their crews,
In dim phantom service, to tauten or loose,
Stepped over to starboard and gathered to
port
To ease the mainbraces, or heave the hooks
short;
But never an order or piping I heard;
And never a cable or tackle was stirred.
Their faces I saw not; but, so to me seemed,
The forms were familiar of them that I
dreamed;
The breeds were as many as races there be
Who’ve answered the call of the seven-
ton gued sea;
Their faces I saw not, but well did I know
They’d shipped from all ports where the salt
waters flow.
Yea, Punic, Hellenic, old Latin and Nord,
From verdant Pi reus, from rocky fiord,
From Tiber and Thames and from Ganges
and Don
The song of the siren had glamored them on,
Had lured them and led them, each wight in
his way,
And bound them and drowned them and hid
them away.
I heard not their voices; hut well did I ken
They spoke in most tongues that are spoken
of men;
They answered to orders or stood to com-
mand
In jargons that shipmen alone understand;
To lingo forgot, or to dialect new,
Each found, as he went, what his hard hands
should do.
1 glimpsed not their garments: but still
might I guess
Their speech would be varied no more than
their dress —-
That some had worn armor of hide or of
brass,
That some had but kirtles of sheepskins or
grass,
While some had donned togas and mantles
of blue,
And others knee-breeches and brave doublets
too.
I viewed not their weapons; but this I could
feel —
With spears and stone axes, with bronze and
with steel
Betimes were they furnished from workshops
afar
That fashion the harness of custom and war;
That rifle and crossbow, that cannon and pike
Had stood them in conquest and. quarrel
alike.
They told not their stories: but well did I
know
That life had been theirs with its ebb and
? its flow —
Hot loves and cold hatreds, great losses, glad
gains,
Successes and failures, man’s pleasures, man’s
pains—
All these had they tasted, until on a day
Death rang down the curtain that ended the
play.
Night Watch! Night Watch! the Captain’s
voice is calling.
Night Watch, Night Watch! the glass of
Time is falling;
Skies are clouding over; seas arc rising gray.
Olr, Night Watch, Night Watch! be on your
knees and pray!
VICTOBIA.

In the Face of the Enemy.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THE ambulance convoys rattled down
the narrow lane, flanked by high
walls grey-bitten with age, and into
the courtyard of the convent, through its
great wooden gates, now opened wide to
the world at war. Once many-windowed,
AUTO-SUGGESTION.
THE WIFE: “Drive steady, Jack; every time you let her out baby cries for the rattle.”
glittering in the sunlight or catching the rays
of closing day, it was now but a shattered
wreck with pity-darkened eyes for all that
lay within. An untouched pinnacle or two
still pointed the upward way—persistent
symbols of beauty and of hope.
White-capped women came out to meet the
cars. “How many?” “Name of God!
Where can we put them?” Full, full to the
last inch of space! And still they came.
And over all rose the shriek of shell and the
crash of falling walls.
The A.D.M.S. and the s Padre crossed the
courtyard, picking a way between the beds
of straw where lay the mangled and shat-
tered, writhing in agony or slipping silently
into the one sure peace. Thence they passed
through the refectory, now converted into a
rough surgical theatre reeking with the
sickly-sweet odor of chloroform, and beyond
it to the medical quarters—a few yards of
space where weary, blood-stained surgeons
snatched their brief respite from the knife-
craft and the hack-work of the operating-
tables. “Butchery, not surgery,” Colonel
Hassall, in charge of this casualty clearing-
station, had described it. No place here for
the fine art of Harley-street! True, but
what would you with the ever-flowing stream
of ambulances down the gloomy lane? To
keep at it —that was everything.
“The boy’s name —something like Carter,
wasn’t it?” asked Nicholson, clerk in holy
orders, whelmed in the tragedy of war, whose
office was for the greater part one of silence
—a ministry where words were of no avail.
He was seated on an up-ended case before
a trestle table, a printed form spread be-
fore him. The precise official wording, with
its suggestion of something implacable, with-
out soul, invulnerable to human emotions,
repelled him. Between it and him came the
picture of what he had just seen—a white-
faced youngster, little older, standing before
a file of men ; then a volley, a cry, the thud
to earth and no more. Of all the horrors
of war this seemed to him the worst. A
smash, a crash, a torn body that was, at
least, passionate and quick—but this was
slow, deliberate, ice-cold justice.
“ ‘John Cartier,’ not ‘Carter,’ ” replied the
Colonel. “When yo.u’ve done pass it over.”
“ ‘Cowardice in the face of the enemy,’ ”
read Nicholson as he bent over to sign the
certificate of death. “Who isn’t a coward in
this hell, Hassall?”
“The nice distinction, Padre, is this. We
all funk, but some funk and go on, and some
break at the straining-point and run—a sort
of displacement, you see. The more highly
sensitised you are the tenser the strain —-
it’s the bulldog breed that just goes on. Any-
how, I hate these executions—fact is, I
rather fear them.”
“Fear them?”
“Yes, fear a mistake. Sometimes I ques-
tion if the whole business isn’t a mistake.
They have a new-fangled term for our old
friend funk; they call it anxiety neurosis
now. But you can’t plead collapse under
the strain of anxiety neurosis before a
court-martial —simply isn’t known! Take
this case. I had to certify he was ‘fit for
punishment,’ and so in the ordinary way he
was; no specific mental trouble or anything
physical the matter with him. But he was
of the refined, highly-sensitised type. The
sort of stuff one imagines they make poets
and artists out of —I don’t know. But this
I do know, Nicholson—the test isn’t the
same for all. Now, that boy Cartier wor-
ried me—his case, I mean. I fought it out
last night in a sweat of doubt- —got into his
boots, as it were, with liis temperament, with
his open-eyed horror; and all the time at
the hack of my head like a hammer struck
‘Duty !’ ‘Duty !’ ”
“And duty won!”
Hassall shrugged his shoulders. “It must
win, I suppose. If it didn’t where would
we all be? One can’t split psychological
hairs in war.”
“No-o-o,” sighed the Padre, “there’s not
even time to die decently,” and he passed
the certificate across to the Colonel. “I saw
him after the court-martial. He had no-
thing to say—kept his lips tight pressed as
if afraid, or maybe ashamed, to open them.
Seemed quite resigned, even as if. glad to
end it all—a life just begun! Hassall, this
is”
“A bloody war, Padre; it is. Yet twenty
years hence, my good sir, they’ll weave
romance out of it and beguile the ears and
fancies of youth again with the heroics of
war—the same ancient lies!”
“I must be 0ff”.... The whole building
seemed to rock as a mass of masonry at the
gabled end fell thundering down. “You will
have to get a move on soon, Colonel —things
arc a bit too hot here!”
“Yes, I’ve issued orders in anticipation,”
and he bent over some papers before him and
sighed wearily. Then for a moment, worn
out by want of sleep, he rested his wracked
head on the palms upheld by his propped
arms. But thought obtruded even into that
brief lapse. Thrusting a hand into his
breast pocket, he drew from it a couple of
letters, ovei'looked in the pressure of imme-

Other lie examined curiously. It was in a

understand what I mean, of course. It’s just a
little favor I thought you mightn’t mind doing for
me, after so many years. Perhaps you wouldn’t
mind? You will remember I had a child 22 years
ago; this month will be his birthday, the very
first we have been apart. He hasn’t written to me
for weeks and weeks. Perhaps you have heard
that his father died two years ago. We lived in

never very rich. We called our boy after hi,

said he was both French and English, and if
anyone ought to go it was surely lie; so he volun-
teered, among the very first. He used to write
so regularly till his regiment went up to the From

you can’t hate me all this time; do try to do

“Yes, what is it?” * He raised his bead
abruptly. “Ah, it’s you, Matron. Well?”
“Afraid it’s a case of clear out, sir, and
that at once. Major Sinclair has just re-
ceived word that they are trying to hold
them till we can get away—but it can’t last
an hour.”
“Ask the Major to see me at once, and
start them getting ready—no time to lose.
Matron, not a minute. He tore the letter
into petty fragments, preserving only the
address, then drew a sheet of paper to him;
Dear Elinor, —I am sorry—
Then with a quick, contemptuous, half-
utterance, he ripped off the slip of banal
words. This was no time to turn conven-
tional phrases or think out pretty senti-
ments. He wrote it stark; —
John Cartier died this morning.
He paused, with the ever-increasing roar
of artillery in his ears, the pressing need
of haste at his elbow.
He met death like a gentleman, facing the
enemy....
“Yes, Major, just one moment,” and he
blurred the words as he blotted them.
A very gallant soldier.
Then he addressed it. “She’ll never know
the truth. This is the truth for her,” he said
to himself.
In the little chapel attached to the con-
vent, in the dormitories, even in the narrow
passage-ways, wounded, dying and even dead
were packed together on the straw-scattered
floors. Now all was commotion, lifting, help-
ing, urging men who shrieked or moaned at '
the disturbance, however gentle it might be.
The given hour passed, and still the enemy
was held. A little longer and the evacua-
tion of all who could be packed into the
motor-ambulances or dared be packed would
be complete, and only the dying and the
dead would be left within the walls of the
ancient building. Only remained the wounded
to be gathered in from the field and carried
back.
The medical staff was the last to leave.
The Padre, too, remained for this final con-
voy. As a matter of duty partly, and also
because he had for Hassall such affection
as is born between men out of the womb of
human suffering.
As the last car reached the roadway into
which the trough of the convent lane emptied
itself it became wedged in a mass of retreat-
ing men, fighting, falling, cursing. Shell after
shell burst in their
ranks, shrapnel
rained on them. It
seemed as though
Hell itself had
loosed its pent-up
fires on the damn-
ed. The Padre
escaped as if by a
miracle, but a
jagged piece of
shell caught Has £
sail in the side,
cutting deeply in-
ward.
The car thrust
itself through the
massed men, whilst
Nicliolsou held the
wounded surgeon
as best he could
till the town had
been passed and
the long line of
straight trees,
marking the re-
treat by the road,
lay before them.
They turned aside
from the traffic,
ploughing through
a river of churned-
up mud, to a little
patch of compara-
tive seclusion by
the roadside. There
they lifted him out,
and the Major—
Sinclair, the next
in command—bent
over him and ex-
amined the wound.
The Colonel looked*
up at him with a
twisted smile.
“Westward ho,
Sinclair?”
He got no an-
swer in words, but
his old comrade’s
face gave all that
was needed.
“Say, Padre,
come here!”
Nicholson knelt
by his side, and
the others, as if
intruding on the
last office for the
dying, drew apart.
“Look in breast-pocket.... letter there to
be posted. Keep address and write. .. .write
for me. See.... listen, Padre. Say message'
from Dick —make it Dick. Padre. Say what
the bon Dieu does—just lift me up a bit....
There! —what He does, dam’ good way-
good enough for me. Only all—got that...;
a 11.... she’ll understand. Say boy splendid
—good boy—good soldier. . . .Worth..
worth a lie, eh? Right! Hand, old man!"
And gripping it he drifted beyond the
tumult and the shouting.

A RESUME.
THE luxurious new P. & O. Royal Mail Steamer Chitral, 15,248 tons,
the third and last of the series of mail steamers recently built for
the Company’s Australian passenger service, arrived at Sydney
on the 15th August, 1925, on her maiden voyage. The P. & O.
Company has now restored its fleet to pre-war strength, and placed
its service on the same footing as in 1914.
Few Shipping Companies in the world were more seriously .affected
by war losses than the P. & O. Company. From a fleet of ninety-six
vessels, aggregating 554,855 tons gross register in 1914 the Company s
tonnage had shrunk in 1919, through war losses, to forty-four ships,
totalling 344,563 tons. Before the war the P. &O. Fleet engaged m the
Australian Service included the following “M” steamers, viz., Medina,
Maloja, Macedonia, Marmora, Malwa, Mantua, Morea, Moldavia, Mongolia
and Mooltan, representing a total of 107,088 tons gross register, but of these
only four remained afloat at the end of the war. The Maloja was mined
and sunk in February, 1916, and the Mongolia met with a similar fate
in June, 1917. The Marmora, Moldavia and Mooltan were torpedoed
in 1917 and 1918. To replace some of the foregoing, new and larger
vessels, bearing the same names, have since been constructed, and the
older “M” steamers have been transferred to the Company’s Far Eastern
services.
As a result of the war losses, the former fortnightly service to
Australia had perforce to be abandoned, but this has now happily been
restored during the present year. To make this, possible the Company
was obliged to build, at enormous expense, an entirely new Fleet for the
Australian Trade. This Fleet comprises the Mooltan and Maloja of eacli
21 000 tons, the Moldavia and Mongolia of 16,500 tons, and three 15,000
ton liners, the Cathay, Comorin and Chitral. In order to secure the
required strength of nine steamers, the ever-popular Naldera and
Narkunda, which had been temporarily employed in Eastern waters,
will be transferred back to the Australian Line. ...As a result of .the
very active building policy which has been pursued, the P. & O. Vleet
now comprises sixty-five vessels, completed or about to be launched,
aggregating 638,919 tons register. It is interesting to trace the growth
of the Company’s Fleet, from the wooden paddle steamer William
Fawcett, of 206 tons gross, launched in 1829, the first steamer owned by
the Company, to the year before the great war, when the Ileet included
seven steamers over 10,000 tons, and then to the present day, when
there are now thirteen vessels of 15,000 tons and over, and fifteen mo
of 10,000 tons or over. The latest units added to the Australian bervice,
the Cathay and Comorin, were launched in November last, within two
hours of each other, and the Chitral completed her trials m June this
year. Each of these up-to-date vessels is designed to carry -03 l irst
and 1:03 Second Saloon passengers, a special feature of the arrangements
being "the large percentage of commodious single-berth cabins in bot i
classes, with the whole of the cabin accommodation on the Upper Decks.
The Lounges and Saloons are particularly spacious and attractive, the
scheme of decoration being reminiscent of the Elizabethan period. Ihe
vessels are fitted with a unique ventilating system, enabling the cabms,
public rooms, bath rooms and engine rooms to be flooded with trash
air at frequent intervals. The dining saloons are capable of seating
the full number of passengers, so that there is never the necessity tor
two sittings for meals. The meals themselves are ot the character and
quality for which the Company has gained a world-wide reputation, ot
which it is justly proud. .
Cards of admission to inspect the steamers, and the fullest informa-
tion, will be furnished to intending passengers on application.

The Winds.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THE winds are my lovers and right well
they know
How to woo with a touch or a sigh.
Or a swift-stolen kiss or a blandishment low.
Who knows I’ll surrender? Who knows? I
may go
To their haunts in the clefts of the sky!
Oh, my brother, my brother is calling to me
(Wind of the wonderful West!),
And lioav can I tell what my brother brings
me—
Magic of Africa, trove of the sea,
Or a bird with a flame-colored crest?
Distracting dilections of vintage and sweet
He is piling before me in pride,
He is whispering of love where the throbbing
tides beat,
He will give me a dolphin to play at my feet
And a steed of the ocean to ride!
Come!.... But someone has dragged me
away by the hair!
(Would you woo me with cudgel and blow
And drag me down, down to some Stygian
lair,
Where the whales fume along and the sea-
creatures stare,
Whether I’m willing or no,
Old foolhardy Northerly, hot with desire,
At the head of your Bacchanal throng?)
Shall I drive his black stallions with lashes
of fire?
Shall I see the world pale, as it bends to his
ire ?
lam going. I’m going along
With the madcap old ruffian !. .. .
Soft, soft ou my hands
Someone’s pouring ineffable balm!
There is scent in my nostrils of tropical, lands
And a vision, O east wind, of shimmering
strands \
And copra and paw-ps&w and-palm !
And Gippsland! My Gippsland! Those
gullies and ferns «
Have pressed bitter musk on your mouth!
Oh, the gum-trees are singing! My fickle
heart yearns
For an old love, my true love who softly re-
turns.
But a youth rushes up from the South!
Fresh is his face and his voice silver-
sweet —
Chorister-like —and his breath
Surges and sings; there are wings to his
feet!
Shall I give him my heart that is weary
with heat
And face the cold kisses of Death?
No matter. Some day I shall wed with the
wind
And tread the bright ways of the sky;
And people will say when I leave earth be-
hind,
“She was young, and so beautiful” (if they
are kind),
“But bewitched and we knew she would
die.”
But some there . will be who will guess at
the truth,
And will never believe that I died.
They will say, “She has captured perpetual
youth!
She has married the wind and the weather
(forsooth!)
And infinitely she will ride.”

A Swimming Lesson at
Phegan’s.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
OUR school was conducted by Barney
Phegan in George Cobb’s barn. In
his attitude towards the creatures of
the wild we saw the tender side of Phegan’s
nature. In his treatment of the boys he
didn’t seem to have any tenderness at all.
But he was fairly lenient with girls; and to
dumb animals, even to the fractious brindlo
cow, he was the acme of kindness.
We were at our tasks when Mr. Bingham
walked in. He looked tired and worried, and
PUTTING HIM IN HIS PLACE.
“My dear lady , I go further than believing in woman’s suffrage—
I maintain that men and women are equal in every way.'”
“Oh, Professor, now you are bragging!”
caused a mild sensation by informing us that
his son Punty had not been home. He asked
Mr. Phegan if he had seen him, and Phegan
passed the question on to us. He cast a
searching look at me, then switched on to
Ern Green and Billy Flynn, because the rebel
travelled the same track as we did. But none
of us had known till then that Punty had
“gone bush.” Though 13 he had been only
one day at the baim-school.
‘‘Keep a look-out as you go home, all of
you,” said Phegan; “and tell your parents
there’s a boy lost. Maybe the men will
muster up to-morrow and look', for him.”
“I think lie’s hidin’ somewhere,” said his
father, gloomily, “I’ll hide the tinker when
I get hold of him. Never had anyone serve
me a trick like this before. Never!”
“He’s got a bit of the brumby in him,”
said Phegan, sourly. “I thought I saw the
THE SLAVE TRADE IN THE SUBURBS.

HUBBY: “What does she leant now?”
WIFE: “Wants me to lend her you this week-end to help put up their new green-house.”
streak when you were giving me an inven-
tory of his virtues yesterday.”
Mr. Bingham looked embarrassed. “Might
be lost intentionally,” he said slowly ;; “an’
there might be some inveiglement. An’ he
might be in the river. God knows! What
would you advise, Mr. Phegan?”
“Wait till to-morrow,” Mr. Phegan re-
plied. “It’s no use of one man looking for
a scamp that doesn’t want to be found.”
Mr. Bingham departed, greatly troubled.
He went along the , river, thereby showing
that he had a fear that Punty had slipped
in and got drowned. That idea appeared to
worry Phegan. ;
Very few of the farmers near the school
could swim. But they wanted their sons to
learn, as the boys were much about the river,
and some had to cross It twice a day. Phegan
couldn’t swim either, -but he undertook to
teach the boys.
“We’ll have swimming lessons to-morrow,”
he announced , before dismissing us. “Every
Wednesday afternoon,” he added, with a
stern look, as if he were handing out punish-
ment. “And till you can fall out as often as
you fall in, don’t let me catch one of you
playing near deep water. It’s a wonder to
me you haven’t made a funeral before now.”
With that important event to talk about we
were less concerned about Punty’s disappear-
ance. We reckoned that if he wasn’t drowned
he was hiding near his home, and so we didn’t
leave our track to look for him. Billy Flynn
said if he didn’t want to be found he didn’t
ought to be looked for, and we let it go at
that.
On Wednesday afternoon we “gathered at
the river” with the liveliest anticipations. It
was warm weather, but nobody felt elated
at the prospect of a dip. There was no sandy
beach nor shallow at our bogey-hole. It was
deep water from the take-off, suggesting a
quick wet way to the Jasper Gates.
Phegan jogged down with a hank of
twine, a pair of plough-reins tied together,
and two inflated bladders that had come by
steamer from the butcher. He also* carried
a small cardboard-box containing a big
green frog, which he had taken from the
water cask. Wo regarded his outfit with
anxiety. Little
Jimmy Irvin slip-
pe d away an d
crouched among the
bushes. He wanted
to observe what
happened to the
rest before he went
in.
“Now, then, get
undressed —all of
you,” said Phegan.
We had no cos-
tumes. None of
us, in fact, • had
ever seen a bath-
ing costume. Un-
dressing took much
longer than seemed
necessary. Buttons
w ere unusually
s t.u bbo rn, and
everybody’s boot-
-1 aces got into
knots. Nobody
wanted to be first.
Meanw h ;i 1 e
Phegan made a
few remarks. He
said that everybody
should know how
to swim, and that
he cojild be taught
quite simply by
one who didn’t
know how. Some
of the boys were rather dubious. They
thought the teacher should be an expert. But
our unlearned professor soon demonstrated
the fallacy of that idea.
He took the frog from the box and held
it tenderly before his wondering pupils. ‘‘You
observe that the frog has five toes and'five
fingers like a human being, and that his
limb structure is much the same,” he said,
dispaying first the dainty little toes and fin-
gers, and then holding the friendly amphibian
up by one leg. “On that account, and other
similarities, the frog is used by medical stu-
dents for dissection purposes. In Sydney
they use hundreds of the creatures, and pay
fourpence a head for them. However, we
have a better use for our little friend than
butchering him. He’s the only swimmer
that’s here. He’s the example that you’ve
got to follow. Now watch.”
He threw the frog in the river, and the
expert, at once struck out for the shore with
powerful strokes.
“You notice how the hands are used, how
the legs are drawn, up and kicked backwards.
If I throw one of you in there, and you do
exactly the same, you’ll swim out just as
easily. As long as you work your hands and
feet and keep calm, you can’t sink. It’s
fright and stupidity that are responsible in
most drowning cases. Maybe a person’s wits
are sharp enough on land, but when he
tumbles into deep water his wits evaporate or
dissolve like a pinch of salt. Bear that
in mind; keep your wits dry, and keep
moving. Like this.”
He took his hat and coat off, and lying
flat on a patch of grass swept his arms
about, and .kicked
his legs in imita-
tion of a swimming
frog, at the same
time puffing and;
blowing as if lie
were really in the
water. We were
sure our'wits would
be quite unper-
turbed if he let us
swim in the same
dry .place. We had
got the .notion that
he was going to
throw us in, like
the blacks did with
their piccaninnies.
But, whereas the
blacks plunged in
to help their strug-
gling tots, we knew
that Phegan wasn’t
going to jump in
after us.;, Every-
one was shoving
and elbowing to
get behind t his
mates.
Phegan stood up
again, his face red
from liis exertions. His swim had made him
sweat. . Then one by one he put us through
the same quaint exercise. _We recovered our
spirits, and laughed and joked as each one
took his turn. Swimming on the grass was
good ; fun.
“We shall now introduce some water into
the proceedings,” said Phegan, taking up the
bladders and the hank of twine. “Come
here. Ted Swan.”
The fun evaporated, and I felt my wits
already getting wet.
He‘\tied the bladders to my ankles, remark-
ing that the human sinker always went down
feet first, and so the buoyant anklets would
help to balance me. Then he tied one end
of the lifeline, as he called the plough-reins,
round my waist, reminding me that he would
have hold of me all the time.
“Now, in you go,” he commanded. “Jump
as far out as you can, then try to swim back
like the frog did. D’you hear?”
I shuffled towards the brink, looking doubt-
fully at the lifeline. “Suppose it breaks?” I
faltered.
“Breaks, you ginger-headed ass!” cried
Phegan. “Is it a whale you think you are?”
He held the line loosely in one hand, and
took a turn round his wrist with the end.
“Jump, you mudliopper!” he ordered sharply,
and I jumped.
When those windbags struck the water they
bounced. I shot over like an acrobat, and
dived deep down among a multitude of
bubbles. Then, my feet being buoyed to the
surface, I couldn’t get my head up again.
The teacher had told me to say “Pull!” when
I wanted to get out. I wanted to get out
very badly, but I could only make distress
; signals with my heels. Instead of being life-
, savers, those balloons were suicidal. When
he did pull me out I was so exhausted that
he gave a demonstration of first aid to the
apparently drowned.
Still he wasn’t satisfied that the floaters
were a failure. He next fastened them under
my arms with several yards of twine. When
I jumped the twine broke, and the floaters
bobbed around my head. On being hauled
out, I volunteered to dare the deep with onlv
the rope on me. Those floaters held moiv
terrors for me than the river did. I a i so
resolved to get rid of the teacher as early as
possible. Not that I meditated drowning
him; but after three more efforts he agreed
that I would soon be able to swim the river
That was the test that would pass us out of
the teacher’s hands.
“I thought I could learn you to swim,” h e
said with conviction. “Come on now, Jack
Thompson.”
It was a comfort to sit on the bank and
watch the others take their turn. When
several of us were dressed we began to see
a lot of fun in Plregan’s fishing. Peter Pos
sum, the black boy, had a sore knee and was
exempted. The afternoon had been the most
enjoyable that Peter had known at school.
His sides ached, and there were streaks down
his cheeks where joy-tears had been running.
The boys resented Possum’s conduct, and
made dark threats about next Wednesday.
The last one called was Jimmy Irvin.
Jimmy had been hoping that he was forgot-
ten. A stir among the bushes caught Phegan’s
eye as the truant tried to bolt.
“After him, all of you !” Phegan shouted
quickly. “Catch him or I’ll souse the lot
of you again.”
Jimmy was captured, brought back and
forcibly undressed. Being annoyed, Phegan
wasted no time with him. He was shoved
in and hauled out several times, the plunges
being interspersed with coughing and gasping.
“Maybe that will give you a better
acquaintance with water, and you won't be
so shy of it next time, Jimmy,” said the
teacher as he finished.
Purity Bingham was discovered two days
later hiding in the river scrub and living on
roasted fish and potatoes. We were glad,
for Phegan had dropped a dark hint or two
about some aquatic exercises he was due for.
Punty returned to school on the following
Monday, feeling sore in more ways than one.
The recent home-coming was a painful
memory. His reception, when he had been
handed over to the custody of Mr. Bingham,
was a very warm one. He was kept busy through
the week-end hilling potatoes, dressed in a
shirt and petticoat. Mr. Bingham surmised
that such a garb would discourage any in-
clination to run away again, and make Punty
appreciate the benefit of going to school like
other boys. He was also warned that if he
misbehaved again he would be taken down
to school in female clothing. The mere
thought of that was horrifying. He hoped
the school would never even hear about the
petticoat. They would call him Pansy, or
Betsy, or something like that, and draw him
on the blackboard.
Thus Punty came back to Phegan’s aca-
demy with a tame and contrite demeanor.
He was so careful that he wouldn’t enter into
an argument. But he was chaffed so un-
mercifully about his recent exploits that he
was glad when swimming-time arrived, as
that excitement overshadowed everything
else. He had longed for some new sensa-
AND ONLY FIFTEEN MINUTES LEFT TO CATCH

tion that would thrust the old ones in the
background—and he and Possum provided it.
They were the only two boys who had not
received their baptism at Phegan’s hands.
Possum was the first; as the new boy had
not seen the process on the previous occa-
sion, he was left till last.
The boys had a grudge against Possum for
enjoying their initial trials and escaping the
dip himself. They told him tales about big
hungry eels they had seen there, and also
a mysterious monster that was supposed to
be a bunyip. Possum made grimaces and
his knees shook. He moved slowly to the
brink with the lifeline on him, and then dis-
appeared out of sight.
He was so long under water that Phegan
became alarmed and hauled in. To his
horror the line came up with nothing on it.
Phegan started violently and turned pale.
“My God, the boy’s drowned!” he gasped
in agitated tones. He stood in a half-crouch-
ing attitude, his hands extended, like a figure
that had been suddenly struck stiff in action.
We crowded to the edge of the bank, star-
ing in awestruck silence at the water. Not
a bubble rose from the still depths. Little
Jimmy Irvin grabbed his clothes and dis-
appeared among the bushes. Old-man Fright
got a grip on all of us, including Phegan.
A slight movement in a bunch of reeds
caused half a dozen to peer down with
tense expectancy. Then we noticed a small
object like the head of a tortoise. It was
Possum’s nose! The rest of him bobbed up
an instant later, and with a great splash,
and puffing like a locomotive, he scrambled
out.
“Oh golly ! Please, sir, the rope come off 1”
he panted as he looked up into Phegan’s
bulging eyes.
The words galvanised the petrified figure
into life. “How did you get back?” he asked,
his voice a bit shaky from the shock he had
received.
“Crawled along the bottom,” answered
Possum.
“Hm !” said Phegan, his brows knitting as
he eyed the marvel. “That’s presence of

When the round of Christmas festivities is engaging you it would
be unwise to overlook the health habit of “One Wolfe’s Schnapps
a Day.” Indeed, at no time of the year is it more essential, since
the system is then necessarily overtaxed by the good cheer inevitably
associated with the Season, and forgetting the daily measure of
Wolfe’s may prove the one little slip to mar your enjoyment of the
Christmas Festivities.
Make sure therefore, that your Christmas order includes
a bottle of Wolfe’s Schnapps for your Health’s sake.
Obtainable in Large and Half-bottles as well as the
Quarter size that is so handy tor travelling use.

mind. That’s the advantage of keeping your
wits dry. Make a mental note of it, all of
you. It’s a mystery to me, though, how
that line came undone. I’ll see it doesn’t
happen again.”
Possum showed no anxiety about it. Nor
did he stem displeased when Phegan tied it
on again. He dived in—'and vanished in
the depths as he had done before!
After watching for a little while, Phegan
hauled in, and again there was nothing on
the line. He looked astonished, but this
time he was not seized with panic. After a
momentary stare he dropped the life-line with
a low, expressive grunt and scratched his
chin.
The quick-slipping of a tight knot under
water was almost uncanny. W e were startled
by the mystery of it more than alarmed for
Possum’s safety. We watched the patch of
reeds, and presently up bobbed the blackboy,
as we expected, pufling and blowing, but
otherwise quite unperturbed.
“Oh golly! Please sir, the rope come off
again!” he exclaimed as he crawled out.
Phegan’s face was a study in amazed and
mystified expressions. Graudally it assumed
a frowning and suspicious aspect. Possum
was enjoying the wonderment and admira-
tion of the audience. Without warning,
Phegan grasped him by an arm and a leg
and heaved him into the river. Possum
went straight down, but after a long interval
he shot up in midstream, and there sported
like a playful porpoise.
“The black imp!” snorted Phegan, shaking
a fist at him, in sudden wrath. “He can
swim like a duck!”
The enlightened audience broke into yells of
laughter. They enjoyed the joke against
Phegan, and admired Possum for a daring
deed of which they had not thought him
capable. But it would have been a much
better joke if Possum had taken them into
his confidence.
“Come out here, you brazen myall!” roared
Phegan, beckoning to the swimmer.
The blackboy churned across the water like
a champion, and landed smartly—out of
reach of Phegan.
“What do you mean?” that gentleman de-
manded in his sternest manner. “Pretend-
ing to be a sinker, taking the rope off under
water, and telling lies about it?”
The blackboy was fumbling with his
clothes. “I only did it for fun,” he pleaded,
rolling his eyes as he dived into his shirt.
“Oh, you did it for fun, did you?” snarled
Phegan. “If you think it’s fun to insult your
teacher and alarm your friends in that
fashion, you have a perverted idea of humor
that needs correcting. Go and water the
garden for the rest of the afternoon. You'll
get buckets at the kitchen, and the water’s in
the river. Maybe you won’t find it so
funny humping it up the bank as doing
tricks in it.”
Possum went off with a sullen count-
enance ; and while we took our turns on the
lifeline, he tramped resentfully up and down
with two ,big buckets.
No further hitch occurred till Punty had
been roped for his first lesson. Phegan had
been rather flustered after his experience with
Possum. A slack part of the line got twfisted
round his ankle, and when Punty jumped out
off the bank the teacher’s leg was jerked from
under him. He sat down heavily, and then
skidded into the river like a log. Jack
Thompson made a grab at him, but only
saved some hair. The victim took the line
with him, and clung to it valiantly, though he
couldn’t do anything else with it. Jimmy
Irvin, who had been forgotten, rushed out to
have a look. He was a small boy, wearing
short pants and braces. Ern Green promptly
threw him down and dragged the pants off
him; then, holding the legs of the garment,
he lassoed Phegan round the neck with the
braces. In a moment or two the floundering
Professor and his pupil were fished out.
AN UNDERSTANDING PAL.
THE KIDDIE: “I say, did you ever tell a lie
when you were a little girl?”
VISITOR : “Yes, I’m afraid so.”
THE KIDDIE : “I’m so glad we can be friends.
I was afraid you hadn’t.”
Funty was half drowned. Pliegan had
picked up a cough and lost his breath. He
had demonstrated that he could swim better
on the grass than in the water. He stamped
his feet and shooK his clothes, and when he
had drained awhile, he said: “Get home, all
of you!”
We got with joyful yells.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
IF Mrs. Brand had been a woman of less
humor she would have been bored. Being
Mrs. Brand, she was amused. Here was a
Saturday afternoon—a summer afternoon—
and here was herself, the most charming,
interesting (as she was candidly telling her-
self) and_ interested woman in the town,
spending it alone ! She threw herself down
on the lawn, whose grass, thanks to the
zealous care of Mackin, was smooth
and green in spite of a blazing Aus-
tralian sun. She stretched lazily and closed
her eyes, loving the heat of it on her body
and the delicate prickling of the grass at the
back of her neck.
Not a soul —not a single soul —to investi-
gate and probe! Not a mind to twist skil-
fully away from its owner’s careful grasp
and dissect at leisure! Not a heart to ex-
plore ! Not even a new face to scan with
WILLING TO RISK IT.
MOTHER: “Oh, Bobbie! How dreadful! Poor Mummie will have to get you a new
bathing-suit!”
BOBBIE: “Never mind, Mummi c—I can go in raw!”
absorbed and calculating eyes! What a
world! She laughed at it as she lay there —
a low, chuckling laugh.
Two more weeks without Adrian! Her
dark eyes flew open in response to the in-
stant amazement which always gripped her
at thej thought of her love for her husband.
She flushed a little, thinking of him, and her
outspread fingers played a sudden rapturous
jig on the grass.
Six years, and she wasn’t tired of him
yet! Surely there was not another man on
earth who could have “fitted” with her as
perfectly as Adrian did. He had no illusions
about her. He watched her at her favorite
diversion of analysing her friends; he saw
her draw from their souls things long hid-
den and unknown even to themselves; he
saw them wince and shrink, feeling the fear
and pain, yet never connecting it with this
beautiful, brilliant-eyed young woman who
was so sympathetic and listened so pati-
ently. “Callous little devil,” he would say.
But he loved her —oh, he loved her! Two
weeks!
The smile, which glimmered in her eyes
was overshadowed suddenly at the thought
of the child she had dreamed of but had never
borne. For the first two years she had not
worried —of course she would have a baby;
she with her splendid body, her love of life
and all the experiences of life. But as time
went on she became puzzled, doubtful
and at last dully resentful. If ever there
was a woman who should have a child it was
she. She was young, healthy, passionate.
She loved her husband.
She sat up and began rocking backwards
and forwards, her whole body and soul one
ache of longing for him.
A flicker of white through the of
the fence attracted her attention. She
watched idly. A woman was moving about
among the bushes and saplings with appa-
rent aimlessness, stooping every now and
then, standing still for a few moments, then
moving on a few steps.
“Oh!” said Mrs. Brand. “Anyone”
She ran to the fence, stood on tip-toe and
called out: “Have you lost something ? Can
I help?”
The woman looked up, and for a few
seconds they stared at each other. It was
a young face that Mrs. Brand saw —a thin,
rather pale face with a big, well-shaped
mouth and inscrutable grey eyes. As its
owner stared she flushed very faintly. People
often did this when they first saw Mrs.
Brand. She dragged at something in you—
she reminded you of things passionate and
primitive.
“I have not lost anything, thank you.”
Mrs. Brand blinked. The woman had
turned her back after her one perfectly civil
but conclusive remark, and seemed to con-
sider the episode at an end. Had such a
thing been conceivable it might have appeared
that she was attempting a snub.
“And I do believe,” murmured Mrs.
Brand, behind the fence once more, “that
she was!” Her expression became rapt.
“An extraordinary woman. Oh, I must
talk to her!”
She jumped two flower-beds and trampled
on a third in her headlong rush for the gate.
“Are they—are they grubs?” she asked in
a small, rather humble voice.
The woman did not start, but she put the
lid on the small tin box which she held, and
turned sharply.
“They are grubs, Mrs. Brand.”
Mrs. Brand stuck both hands in _ the
pockets of her sports coat and smiled vividly.
“Oh, you know me —how nice! Do come
and hgye afternoon tea —you and the grubs.
And tell me your name.”
“My name is Wyndham —Jean Wyndham.
I teach at the public school.” She smiled
very suddenly—a faint smile that vanished
as abruptly as it had appeared. “I have
heard of you—from Miss Higginson. And I
knew your husband many years ago—in Mel-
bourne.”
“Why, we’re almost old friends on the
strength of that!” and her eyes held an
impish sparkle as she saw Miss Wyndham
begin to move docilely towards the house.
It was just as Mrs. Brand was curling one
foot beneath her preparatory to sinking com-
fortably into the depths of the armchair
opposite her guest’s that their eyes met.
Met, and for one unbearable moment held.
Masks on, they stared at each other, Miss
Wyndham pale and expressionless, Mrs.
Brand vivid, lovely, a friendly smile frozen
on her red mouth.
Thrciugli the open window came a warm,
aromatic breath of the bush. It gathered up
the scent from a bowl of roses, and flung
the vague, mixed sweetness into the faces of
the two women. It held Miss Wyndham
stiller than ever; but Mrs. Brand lifted her
face to it eagerly, instinctively, all thought
swept away for the moment by her sensuous
pleasure in its fragrance.
She sat down then, a tingle of anticipation
in her veins. This would be harder. The
others were too easy—old Mr. Rodd and
Nancy Ewen and Miss Higginson.
She rang for tea, which was brought ex-
quisitely by an exquisite maid. She poured
it, infusing into every commonplace action
a daintiness that seemed a subtle compliment
to her guest.
When Miss Wyndham had finished and
put her cup down on the tiny table beside
her, Mrs. Brand opened fire.
“You said you knew Miss
Higginson? I never see her
nowadays.”
“She doesn’t go out much,
I think.”
“Why, she used to be
always trotting round! I
saw a great.deal of her at
one time.”
Miss Wyndham flushed
suddenly, and angrily.
“So I believe,” she said.
There was so much of un-
derstanding in her voice—
so much of anger controlled
and scorn only thinly veiled
—that Mrs. Brand smiled,
lifting her eyebrows amus-
edly. She liked to pit her
brains against other brains,
and, once knowing herself
revealed, she abandoned the
pretence of guilelessness with
relief.
She changed the subject.
“What do you teach, Miss
Wyndham?”
Some of the mask-like
rigidity faded from Miss
Wyndham’s face. She re-
laxed in her chair, and
looked at Mrs. Brand with
eyes from which all hostility
had faded. “Science, mostly.”
She indicated the box on her
knee with a smile. “Hence
the grubs.”
“And you like it?”
“Sometimes I like it.
Sometimes I feel very—fed
up.”
“Ah, yes. When the children are trouble-
some and inattentive —little demons !”
Miss Wyndham smiled slightly. “The
children are seldom inattentive or trouble-
some ; I keep them working too hard. But”
-—the smile died suddenly out of her eyes,
leaving a look of wistfulness that went oddly
with her firm mouth —“it’s the loneliness,
Mrs. Brand. I have no friends in the town,
you see.”
Mrs. Brand was disappointed. She had
not expected her guest to capitulate so easily.
She was not quite sure of her, q,nd proceeded
cautiously.
“Among the other teachers? Are there
none you could”
“No. And I meant more than the actual
people. It’s the lack of a home that hurts
a woman, I think.”
“But there’s a certain charm in your
method of life, isn’t there? A freedom!”
Miss Wyndham’s smile was almost apolo-
getic. “It might seem so to you, Mrs.
Brand. It’s a dreadful thing for an intelli-
gent and emancipated woman of the twentieth
century to say, but does a woman really want
freedom?”
“Surely”
“You’re happy—one has only to look at
you. And yet you are chained right and left.
Your beautiful home —your husband —all
these wonderful books and pictures—child-
ren, I expect.”
She had been staring thoughtfully through
the open window as she spoke, but at the
last word her eyes flew back to her hostess’s
face, suddenly narrowed, bright, searching.
Quick as she was, Mrs. Brand was not
quick enough to hide the lightning flash of
pain in her eyes. Her color blazed furiously.
For the first time she had been wounded
with her own weapons. Skirmishing for an
opening into Miss Wyndham’s mind, she
had left her own unguarded. With what
strange, unerring accuracy the opponent had
found her vulnerable spot, and —she twisted
a little in her chair, her breath coming faster
than usual —how it had hurt! How it was
hurting still —dragging,, tearing, aching,
throbbing! Through the agony of her soul
her busy mind became suddenly deeply in-
terested. A new experience—what was it
that was hurting so? And why?
By degrees she understood that she was
feeling shame for the first time in her life—
shame that this very inmost secret of her
heart had been revealed; shame that anyone
should recognise the triumphant womanhood
which shone from her as incomplete.
She pulled herself together.
“I have no children,” she said easily, “and
among all the things you mention I think
that they are really the only chains. The
others are—what shall I say? A refuge—
armor.”
Miss Wyndham replied with the air of
one not particularly interested, but keeping
the conversation going from a sense of polite-
ness. “You think so? It seems to me that
every bit of love one gives—far from being
armor—makes one more vulnerable.”
“And the love one receives?” suggested
Mrs. Brand smoothly. “Have you had any
experience of that?”
“I have. I shall tell you about it pre-
sently, perhaps. But, first, I want to ask
you a question. Why did you ask me here?”
“I was bored,” said Mrs. Brand promptly.
“I wanted someone to talk to.”
“I have been some time in the town,” Miss
Wyndham continued reflectively, “and on all
sides I have heard of you. Having known
your husband, as I told you, I was rather
more interested than I usually am in gossip.
‘Mrs. Brand is so clever.’ ‘So beautiful.’
‘So artistic.’’ ‘So sympathetic.’ ‘So deeply
interested in’ —this, that and the other!
Arid then I came to know Miss Higginson.”
She leaned forward abruptly. “Tell me.
how much amusement did you get out of
torturing that poor little creature?”
Mrs. Brand laughed good humoredly. “You
exaggerate, Miss Wyndham.”
“I think not. I have met other—victims.”
She sat very still, looking rather foolish,
as all unbending people do when others
laugh. And Mrs. Brand laughed and laughed,
her dark head thrown back, her eyes half-
shut, till her laughter seemed to fill the room,
the world, the universe with its gay, clear
sound. Miss Wyndham grew whiter, and her
face became pinched and old. Her fingers,
clasped round the little tin box of grubs,
were tense and rigid. And when Mrs. Brand
sat straight again, dabbing her moist lashes
with a lacy handkerchief, and trying despe-
rately to control her dimples, Miss Wyndham
began to speak with a curt note of command
that held her instantly attentive.
It seemed to Mrs. Brand as she listened
PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL.
“ ’N’ what do yer think of them blokes what has a
mornin’ shower all the year round?”
“Think a lot of ’em are liars.”
that she could not separate her intense, im-
personal interest from the strange, chill
dread that seemed to be creeping over her.
Here , was her own mind being presented to
her with masterly accuracy, and she listened
absorbed to Miss Wyndham’s analysis of it.
So lost was she that she started slightly at
the question:
“It’s mental vivisection — isn't it?”
She answered flippantly, the cold, sick
fear deepening:
“I always like to see the wheels go round.”
“Wheels! You asked me here for that,
too. You won’t have any trouble. I'll show
you. You shall see my wheels as they go
round now-—-as they have gone round for the
last twelve years—ever since your husband
was my lover and the father of my little
son. Look at them —lov£ and loss and lone-
liness—round and round —love and loss and
loneliness—over and over again! Is it in-
teresting? I loved him. I lost, him and
my baby. Ever since I have been lonely.
Those are my wheels —there’s nothing else.
I was only eighteen, and we both went a
little bit mad. He offered to marry me—rlie
was good to me always. But he didn’t love
me really, and the little son died, and”
It seemed to Mrs. Brand, when at last
she lifted her face from the cushions, that she
had been struggling with some horrible
nightmare. The room had faded into dusk.
On the floor, touched into rosy brightness by
the last, dark unset glow, lay the little tin
box of grubs. But Miss Wyndham had gone.

Wander-Wine.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
WE drank, and the wine we drank was a
wander-wine;
And now afar, over the swinging sea,
Over the sundering ranges, comrades mine,
We follow a lure where stars of mystery
shine
And life fares free!
Under a black-roofed storm or a star-white
sky
Gaily we go. We ride where a staggering-
sun
Stares agape and the white-bleached skele-
tons lie;
We speed on summery surf where seas curve
high
And foam-lines run.
Where lazy schooners 101 l in an opaline
Light of the moon we sing and arouse the
night.
In dim-lit mountain shanties, comrades mine,
We troll a rolling song to the god of wine
Till dawning light.
We drink of dreams in the drowsy isles afar;
And in the land of desolate leagues of snow
We sip the saving brew of the samovar.
We drink; the breeze where brown boronias
are
And gum-flowers blow.
We roam through mossy ruin and marble
town ;
We glide on wide slow rivers in tropic
noon.
We dance where diamonds dance; we dance
where brown
Beauty is overdressed by a blossomy crown
Under the moon.
We ride and ring the cattle across the plain;
We clipjb through shadowy ranges riven
and bare;
We gallop and glance behind and gallop
amain
Where bushfires follow astride of a wind
insane
And flame-whips flare.
Over the long, slow roll of the trade-swung
seas
We sweat and swear where pistons clatter
and leap;
On grassy beaches, under a tent of trees,
Hearing the low slow croon of the noon-warm
* breeze,
We drowse and sleep.
We love the lasses whose lips arc warm for
love,
Whose eyes are large with languor under
the moon;
And wdien we toil with a typhoon roaring
above
We dream of love where meadowy breezes
move
In rigadoon.
For love is a wine, my comrades all, a fine
Vintage of life; and under the sky-wide
dome,
Love is the one sole mystery, comrades mine,
Potent to challenge at last the wander-wine,
For love calls home.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
WHEN William Mcßobin, the master
carrier, was killed some little time
ago in an accident, of which he him-
self seemed Ao be the main cause, city people
generally wondered how so level-headed a
man could commit such a stupidity as
brought about the smash. It appears that
he was being driven from Sydney to Drum-
moyne to inspect some property by an estate-
agent in a motor-car. When about to cross
the Pyrmont Bridge they found the traffic
held up while a vessel passed through, the
central span being open for the purpose. It
was then that Mcßobin committed the folly
in question. He grabbed the steering-wheel
and tugged on it madly, with the result that
NATURAL ENEMIES.
“My dear, how did it happen?"
“Oh, that fool, Reggie, at the dance last night
started to do the fox-trot while I was
doing the goose-step .”
the car slewed across the road, bumped the
footpath and pitched over on top of its occu-
pants. Mcßobin was killed and the agent
severely injured.
So much the evening papers published,
and most of this was based on the statement
made by Foskett, the agent, before he re-
lapsed into unconsciousness. One of the
papers also suggested that a noisy demon-
stration of the unemployed close by had
upset his nerves. In one of the clubs the
matter was discussed, and Fenton, the soli-
citor, offered an explanation.
“Do you know,” he said, “I believe Mc-
Robin’s stupidity was due to subconscious
superstition ?”
“Subconscious fiddlesticks !” came a reply
with convincing emphasis. “Don’t you know
that Mcßobin was one of the most material-
istic brutes imaginable?”
And thereupon ensued a hot argument as
to the likelihood of Fenton’s theory till he,
being cursed of nature and having a flair
for the unessential, undertook to prove his
point.
“Do you happen to know how Mcßobin
got his start in life?” he asked.
“No, I do not.”
“Well, I do; but I will reserve the infor-
mation till I have unearthed a few more
facts.”
Fenton, in spite of a little previous know-
ledge, must have had some difficulty in pur-
suing his inquiries, particularly as the next
statement Foskett seemed likely to make
was the one that men are credited with hav-
ing to pronounce before their Maker. But
quite a lot of interesting matter came to
hand—some, indeed, which we are compelled
to omit from this story.
Mcßobin, it appears, started his business
career as the driver and proprietor of a one-
AUTO-SUGGESTION.
MOTHER: “Oh, that reminds me, Effie, our bathroom blind's out of order!”
horse delivery van at a suburban station.
It is difficult to imagine how such an occu-
pation could possibly be the foundation of
considerable worldly success, and Mcßobin
is too dead to let us into the secret. How-
beit he prospered, and there must have been
a good reason for his doing so. One thing
seems quite certain : he delivered his parcels
with a very exact punctuality, and surely
such a virtue must have its reward. A
peculiar feature of this punctuality was that
Mcßobin was never ahead of time ; he was
always precisely on it. This was quite obtru-
sively apparent, and one of his patrons once
remarked inquiringly on the fact to the car-
rier, who readily gave his reasons.
“No, sir, I don’t like to be ahead of time;
it don’t pay. Nine cases out of ten the other
chap's not ready for you, and then there’s
trouble and delay. Steady and on time does
it.” He went on to say why he drove a delivery-
van. “I once thought of taking on a hansom-
cab till I recollected how often they were
asked to hurry and skurry, so I thought I
would go in for something quieter like. As
I said, sir, ‘Steady and on time does it.’ ”
This seems to have been his guiding star
throughout, and whether it was by this or
not he certainly made a success of his busi-
ness, so that he bought one, two, three and
gradually a little fleet of delivery-vans. And
very sedulously did he pass on to his drivers
his prescription of punctuality. As he ex-
panded he did not develop a big system of
quick inter-suburban deliveries or anything
of that sort. No. Lorries, drays and teams
of slow, powerful horses for the haulage of
heavy freights—that was his measure, and
wool and wheat his favorite cargoes.
Mcßobin prospered hand in hand with
Sydney, the seat of his operations. The
whole city teemed with investments, and he,
in spite of a family of women thirsting to
spend his earnings in the gay life, had money
to invest. But not for him were gambles
on the Stock Exchange or speculations in
real estate. Steady and on time for him!
He sought out solid terrace investments and
soundly-built cottages for leasing at a fair,
safe return for his money. He was the usual
hard, relentless landlord, but he was careful
never to cheat himself by rapacity. No needy
family was ever evicted from one of his
houses for not paying rent —unless he had
another tenant ready. In these days of
the housing shortage there is no need for
such care, but Mcßobin knew of other times
than these.
In his carrier’s business he was slow to
take to motor traction, and even then he used
it sparingly. As to a car for himself, all
the wiles of his exasperated womenfolk could
not bring him to it. He seldom rode in
anyone else’s, and never in a taxi-cab.
Foskett, the agent, who did not die, told
Fenton how he arrived prematurely for his
appointment on the fatal day. Mcßobin,
already incensed at this, exclaimed petu-
lantly on seeing that they were to travel
by motor. And the agent, in the manner of
his kind, replied smoothly: “I am sorry if
I seem to rush you, sir, but mine are not
the only hands in which the property has
been placed.”
“Quite so. But, likewise, this is not the
only investment in the market. I hate all
this rushing and bustle. Steady and on
time does it.”
Nevertheless they got into the car and
were soon away. As they passed down
Market-street towards its intersection with
Sussex-street a sound of confused shouting
reached their ears.
“Good gracious!” said Mcßobin. “What
is that?”
He shivered, and as they crossed Sussex-
street towards the bridge a wild uproar from
a crowd of men close by caused him to pale
visibly.
“Quick —no, steady!” he exclaimed. “Why
are we so early? This would have been all
over if we had been just on time.”
He was evidently suffering great agitation.
Foskett, suiting himself, heard the first part
of the instructions only. He accelerated,
gained the bridge, then swore lustily. A
line of traffic was drawn up ahead of them.
This meant that the bridge was closed. Mc-
Robin, turning from a fearful glance behind,
looked in front and saw the middle span of
the bridge swinging out to allow a boat to
pass through. A low groan _ escaped him.
Then he did a strangely stupid thing. He
lurched over, his weight displacing Foskett,
grabbed the steering-wheel and tugged on it
like a maniac. The car slewed across the
road and struck the iron railing. Another
second and it turned over on top of them.
All this information was hardly con-
clusive to Fenton’s contention, but he came
forward with a further set of facts. It
may be recalled that, during the shearers’
strike of the early ’nineties, much disorder
prevailed throughout the country, and many
towns endured great travail of turbulence.
Corm, which was the terminus of the rail-
way and the centre of a large pastoral
district, suffered much of this. Each day’s
train brought fresh loads of shearers, and
each fresh load joined the ranks of the
strikers. The town filled with them; hotels
overflowed into camps, while camps grew
and multiplied. All of these were tumultu-
ous, but the most excitable was that which
was pitched at the far end of the bridge
across the river. So bad did the disorder
become there that the town authorities de-
cided that, unless the disturbances subsided,
the Riot Act must be read. Moreover, be-
ing impolitic, they made known their inten-
tions to the strikers by way of a threat.
The strikers seethed with indignation over
this and there was further uproar. The ex-
treme step became necessary. But here was
trouble; the magistrate of the town was
away. They were obliged to get one over
from Derilda if they wished to carry out
their purpose. A wire was sent and the in-
formation leaked out to the shearers, who
promised the visitor a warm reception.
And so it came to pass that
the magistrate left Derilda
late one evening. He was not
in the best of spirits, but he
was in the best of hands, for
Cobb and Co. had chosen the
most reliable of their drivers in
the district to take him across.
This worthy, a wonderful whip,
was summoned and received his
instructions. _ The coach was
ordinarily timed to arrive at
Corm at 7 a.m., but he was on
this trip to leave Derilda later
than usual —well after dark—
taking an unaccustomed route.
Could he do it and get to Corm
an hour early?
“Can Ido it!” he boasted.
I have been on nearly every
run between the Lachlan and
the Murray, and those who
have seen me fail to beat the
time-table in fair weather are
hard to find.”
This, though boastful, was
true, and it was true also that,
besides being fast, he was safe
and used his horses finely. So
away he went that evening with
his passenger. All the night he
drove fast find well. At the first
change of horses he was up
to time; at the second he was
ahead of it. A few miles out
of Corm he looked at his watch,
barely visible in the earliest dawn. He was
ahead of his programme and going well.
Good! Fast travelling that! He would
be in town at 5.45—a quarter of an hour
ahead of his contract. Cobb and Co. would
be pleased to hear it. They were pastoralists
themselves and would like to see the shearers
beaten.
Presently he distinguished the dark line
of trees along the river bank and the gap
in it where the road went through. And
what was that he heard? A steamer
whistle ! It must be one of the river boats
coming up for a load of wool. And by
Jove! it was whistling for the bridge to
open and let it through. He might be held
up outside the bridge. Damn! There was
that camp of strikers right alongside the
road. Why had he hurried? If he had
kept to his proper time the boat would have
been through and he could have kept straight
on. Too late now! Pie was almost on to
the bridge approachete marked on .either
side by white railings. He could see the
sparks shooting up out of the steamer’s
funnel as she passed through; the barge
she towed had yet to come, and the swinging
span that opened and shut acted slowly.
He must pull up and wait. He hoped no one
would wake in the camp.
But he hoped in vain. The steamer’s
noise had evidently roused someone, and this
someone saw the eoaeh. A quick alarm was
given and trouble flared no like a well-fed
fire. Hoots, groans, hisses, sticks, stones
and all sorts of missiles assailed the coach:
the driver was knocked almost unconscious
by a piece of metal. The horses, taking
fright, bolted along the causeway towards
the bridge. Maddened _by feat, their p ace
was terrific. The driver, half recovering
from his blow, realised that the wooden ij at '
run temporarily across the bridge, would nut
•stop liis team. In his mind he pictured them
all going over the gap into the river below-
—a drop of 20 feet. He did the only thing
his numbed brain could think of. lie drew
on one rein like a demon and deliberately
drove his horses into the rails of the
approach.
The result, as told afterwards, was a
very sad altair; horses broken and hurt,
the coach and its load an indescribable
litter on the roadside, the magistrate badly
shaken but not hurt.
The driver, an unconscious heap close
by, was badly injured, and spent many weeks
in the hospital. But he recovered, attd Cobb
and Co., who, as lias been said, were pas-
toralists, paid hint good compensation, With
this money in his pocket he went to Sydney
and started a new career with a.One-horse
delivery van. That drivel* was Mcßobin;
and, as he lay those weeks in the hospital,
he evolved a new philosophy for himself;
“Steady and on time does it.”
So possibly Fenton Was right.
GORDON TROLLOPE.
A Bagful of Eels.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THE little man struggled out of the
boat on to the pier which loomed
scraggily and drunkenly out of the
low tide.
“Good-bye, Sam,” he called cheerily. His
companion, a tall, thin man, whose legs were
bunched up awkwardly in a crazy sft. dingy,
waved gloomily and rowed out to a dis-
reputable-looking motor-boat which lay hi
the safety of the channel beyond the sand
flat.
The sun blazed down on the pier and the
shrub-covered sand which stretched north
towards Sydney. The little man did not
seem to mind in the least. Grasping an
old sugar-bag firmly in his right hand, lie
straggled cheerfully down the road, warbling
something which was so fearfully out of
tune that it might have been anything.
There came a sudden stop to the singing
as out of the shimmering haze of the terrific
heat his eyes caught the sign “Botany Bay
Hotel.” He quickened his pace, and made
for it as a man might make for a water*
hole out in the dread, dry monotony of the
spinifex.
Entering the public bar, he threw down
his bag and called enthusiastically for a pint.
The barkeeper, a surly, thick-set man, set
down a mug with a thud. He demanded
payment, which the little man threw across.
The bag wriggled wildly at the little man’s
feet. The barman leaned over the narrow
bar.
“Wptchergot in that flamin’ bag—snakes?
Flamin’ snake-catchers are a flamin’ nuis-
ance.”
“Snakes!” The little man laughed scorn-
QUITE BRILLIANT.
HUBBY : “I sometimes think that you only married me
for my money.”
WIFEY : “My dear, you're improving. These lucid inter-
vals are distinctly encouraging.”
fully. “Snakes? Eels! Give me eel-fishing
before anything. I’ve fished tuna off Florida,
kingfish in Broken Bay and sunfish off
California; but give me eel-fishing up the
George’s River and you can have the rest.”
The surly bartender accepted the gift with-
out a word of thanks.
“Fished all last night,” continued the little
man. “Caught twenty-four,” he boasted to
the empty bar. “Twelve to Sam; twelve to
me. Look at that!” he demanded, tackling
the bag low and resuming the perpendicular
with 3ft. of eel wriggling like mad in his
hand.
“Now, Bill,” he admonished the slippery
yard of energy facetiously, “behave for the
good man.”
“Aw! Put the flamin’ thing away; they
remind me of snakes,” said the barman, and
turned and scowled heavily at a water-jug.
“Snakes!” ejaculated the little man from
behind a pewter, his diction blurred with
beer. “Snakes! Anyone would think you
suffered at some recent stage of your life
from ingrowing d.t.’s.”
The barman turned in a fretful anger.
“Snakes it is! Silly, flamin’ cows out ’ere
roam into the bar from the bush and the
swamps with all kinds of reptiles, and leave
’em lyin’ about careless. One bloke got blind
drunk and left seven death-adders in a old
portmanty—the cow! I didn’t sleep fer five
flamin’ nights after that. Professors they
calls themselves! Pro-flamin’-fessors!”
“Snakes!” said the little man, with an
attempt at even greater scorn than before.

OUR XMAS GREETINGS TO ALL
“At every stage of life's high road
Good Luck and Pleasure meet youf


It was mellowed considerably by the addi-
tional pints which had been sunk. “ Snakes!
I’ve fished tuna off Florida”
“Yes. Yer told me about that flamin'
rubbish and worded me I could ’ave the flamin’
places. I know it—yer like eels!” He glared
at the little man, who made a move to pro-
duce a specimen. “I don’t wanter see yer
flamin’ eels, they’re nearly as bad as
snakes.”
“Snakes!” Again the little man syphoned
out the word with contempt just as a sun-
tanned, scrawny individual insinuated him-
self out of the Bessemer glare and heat of
the outside and put a sugar-bag carefully
down near the counter.
NATURAL HISTORV.
LITTLE STELLA : “There's our Sunday-school leacher, Evelyn was so rade to her last
week."
FOND MOTHER: "In what way, sarling?"
LITTLE STELLA: “What she told as that at the Flood all living ereatures except those
in the Ark were drowned, Evelyn a shed her what happened to the fish.”
The newcomer offered no beg-pard'ons.
“Snakes,” he snarled, “is the best cobbers in
the wide. ,I know —I’ve bin handlin’ ’em
for years.”
The barman whipped round. The bag was
out of his range of vision. “ ’Ullo!” he
growled, his eyes full of suspicion. “You
another of the snake pro-flamin’-fessors. Don’t
bring the flamin’ things in ’ere or, be the
holy cripes, I’ll throw ’em into the bush.”
The newcomer ignored the barman. “Hava-
drink!” he said.
The little man murmured that the weather
was hic-isli and had one and shouted back,
and the lanky piece of over-baked Cornstalk
called another one and the little man doubled
the call. And as they swarmed up the little
man grew lyrical over eels and the sun-
hardened citizen sna'rled friendly praise of
snakes. And every time he caught the eel-
speaker’s eye the barman fretted and glow-
ered in the background, seeking an excuse to
vent his fearful hate of the reptiles. He
boiled over finally when the little man wanted
to cool the eels in the water in which the
barman rinsed his glasses. “Outcha get 1 !”
he growled, and, with unnecessary enthusi-
asm, threw the little man —who protested
politely—into the baking sunlight. Then,
triumphant but still surly, the barman caught
the little man on the ear with the bag of
wriggling forms as he rose.
The barman disappeared into the cool
depths, and the little man philosophically
meandered down the road, oblivious of the
termination of his sudden friendship, and
passed out of the life of the barman and the
snake-worshipper forever.
He boarded a car at the terminus and sat
in front.
The driver kicked the bag aside, banged a
warning and switched over to full. There
was a wriggling and a hissing.
“Hullo! Wliat’s that?”
“That, or those, are, eels,” said the front-
seat passenger thickly: but with dignity. “Give
me eel-fisliing before anything. I’ve fished
tuna off Florida” —-lie went through his
piece, finishing by diving into the bag and
holding a specimen proudly by the neck.
“Fer the love of Gawd, lemme”—gasped the
terrified driver and jumped wildly on to the
street, disappearing in a cloud of dust. The
conductor, pre-occupied with his ticket-slip,
didn’t ndtice anything wrong till a dozen
stops had passed. He scurried along to the
front and grabbed the controls.
“Where’s the driver?” he queried.
“He. got off back there,” said the little
man. waving vaguely towards the rear.
“Blime! He musta gone dippy.” The
conductor applied the brakes and went in
search of a ’phone.
The little man, tired Of waiting, gathered
up his wriggling freight and wandered down
the long, hot street towards the city.
The hotel bar was empty. A barmaid lan-
guidly inquired his wants.
“Two pints—one for yourself,” said the
little man gallantly. He placed the sugar-
bag on the polished bar.
“Here you!” snapped the barmaid. “Take
that filthy rubbish off the bar.”
“Filthy rubbish!” said the little man with
dignity. “Filthy rubbish! These are eels.
Eels! I have fished” —— The barmaid
made a snatch at the bag, but the little man
got in first.
There was a wild writhing; a sinister-
looking head thrust out of an opening and
hissed at her. She collapsed behind the bar.
The little man banged the head back into
the bag, drank the two pints, caught the door
at a third try and went out into the traffic.
Beers marked his passage as beacons mark
a dangerous channel.
His enthusiasm and pride increased with
the successive drinks, but he found less and
less friendliness as he worked nearer to the
cold heart of the city.
His overtures were unfeelingly rebuffed.
In the long bar of the Australasia he found
a weak individual who listened with obvi-
ously forced politeness while the little man
told, of Sam and the motor-boat out at
Botany. He warmed up at this oasis of
friendliness in a desert of private bars.
“Eels!” he _ declared with enthusiasm—“give
me eel fishing before anything! I’ve fished
tuna off Florida, kirigfish off Broken Bay
and sunfislx off California; but give me eel-
fishing up the George’s River and you can
have the rest. Why”
“Here, buv yourself a beer,” said the indi-
vidual uncomfortably. He thrust sixpence
into his hand and fled before the little man
could produce a specimen from the bag.
Aghast at being considered a common beer-
bam, the little man threw the sixpence dis-
gustedly away and walked out into Castle-
•reagjt-street as the clock chimed the six
o clock curfew.

The big club brooded over its surroundings,
and the surroundings, not to be outdone,
brooded over the club. But it was a very
respectable brooding on both sides, all things
considered.
In the smoke-room a steward entered, re-
moved a glass and a soda-water bottle, placed
a fresh ; glass and a fresh bottle and with-
drew silently. At intervals he returned, re-
peated the action and withdrew. And the
sole occupant drank, and then drank some
more.
Outside on the kerbstone sat a little man,
who might have been ill, starving or asleep
—-but who was merely very drunk,
He was apostrophising the gutter,
“Eels—twelve to me and twelve to hie—to
hie—to hie—Sam. Give me—hie—eels—hie
eels. I’ve—hie—l’ve—hie—l’ve—give me—
liic—eels,” he -was saying,
At the corner a lurking figure eyed him
furtively. For a minute the street was de-
sorted. The stranger flitted along in the
shadows and bent over the man on the kerb,
His hands made a quick search of his victim,
“Here! What—hie—you doing?”
“Gorstrutli!” muttered the dip savagely,
“Not a brown! Wot’s in the bag?”
“Eels—hie—eels. I’ve caught tuna”——
“Blastya!” He snatched the bag, kicked
the little man in the ribs and made towards
• the 'corner,
A big, helmeted figure loomed into view at
the far light. With a turn of his wrist the
thug cast the bag neatly through an open
window and hastened down the street.

The steward entered, placed another glass
and bottle of so da-water and withdrew. The
man in the big chair moved his hand and
then held it as if suddenly paralysed. His
face was white except where his nose purpled
unbleachable. An ugly, squat snake

NORMAN R. FREEBERG.
An Artistic Mariner.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
G APT AIN .Tames Pilcher, master of the
Hinemoa, thick-set and well groomed,
with the Navy manner, and William
Allen, the ship’s agent, tall and lean, looking
like a cattleman in from Dirranbandi,
entered the cabin to sign the ship’s papers
before taking a final lunch together.
Allen, worn with the worry of loading a
large ship with frozen meat, sank into one
of the captain’s comfortable chairs, glad of
the subdued light and the soft touch of the
Bokhara carpet. His eyes travelled con-
tentedly from the panelled walls to the Old
Man making preparations to mix a cocktail
by the deep red light of two tall Persian
lamps that flanked the writing-table. He
felt as a woman feels when she kneels before
lighted candles in a church —at peace with
the world.
A work of art the mixing of the cocktails,
almost a religious rite; Allen thought of
Kreisler’s playing of a sonata, and smiled as
he noted the captain's artistry with sprinkler,
crushed ice and bottles. As the second Ver-
mouth was added to the glasses, Allen sat
forward suddenly and opened his lips to
speak. Two drops of blood the size of half a
crown appeared on the strangly-engraved
salver. He looked again. He was sure that
they were not there when the salver had been
lifted from the drawer, because he had
handled the salver to see the wonder of the
engraving. He leaned a little closer.
“That blood!” he exclaimed to the captain.
"Have you cut yourself?”
“No, no,” said Captain Pilcher, looking up
with a half-bored, half-whimsical smile; “it
always comes on the salver when I am mix-
ing cocktails. A very interesting story. There
are some who doubt that there is any magic
in the East —don’t spill any, it’s precious,
Allen. This salver has a history—well,
cheerio, old man! —given to me by a Russian
woman in Odessa after the Armistice.”
Captain Pilcher turned his back on the
salver and changed the subject, talking about
the Australian meat trade and the cost of
moving a ship from one works to another to
pick up cargoes. “Ferrying, you call it,
eh ? It’s like the old American river trade,
a few tons here, a few there—all right, Dob-
son, we shall come at once; you can serve
the soup. Do have another of Dobson’s
hors-d’oeuvres, Allen, and let me give you the
other half of your cocktail.”
Allen laughed at the idea of a fresh cock-
tail being the other half of the first one, but
let the captain go ahead with the mixing, for
the joy of watching his skill and because,
as the captain had turned round, he had seen
the blood on the salver again. With the
cocktails tossed down, the pair went into
the adjoining cabin for lunch.
“Tell me the story of that salver,” said
Allen, as the consomme warmed the cockles
of his heart.
“Yes, quite an unusual story. • I had a
shore billet at Odessa, in the Black Sea.
During the Gallipoli business I had been in
charge of a mine-sweeper in the Straits;
afterwards I was laying mines in the North
Sea; but when the Armistice came a thought-
ful Government sent me to Odessa. Looking
after British interests, investigating mur-
ders, helping Allied prisoners filter through
from Russia. A queer job. Periods of ex-
citement and then the doldrums. Do have
some of that sole. Yes, from England. There
is no fish in the world like that which grows
in the English Channel. I don’t know why.
Best feeding grounds, I suppose.”
“About the salver,” said Allen. “You
had a shore billet at Odessa?”
“Oh, yes. A strange story. One day I had
just entered my office —a bit of a shack near
the water-front —when a woman was shown
in. No stage queen ever looked so royal or
so gracious as that woman, Allen. A woman
in a million. The most beautiful creature I
ever saw. At first I thought she was Eng-
lish. She didn’t have the English coloring,
but the cut of her chin, the poise of her, the
blue eyes—you know what I mean. A Rus-
sian, a refugee, but I can see her now as
she sat at my table: as calm as if I were a
bank-teller and she were making a deposit.
Nothing but the occasional quiver of a nostril
to show the agitation within. The most
beautiful woman I ever saw. Her people
had been large landholders up Moscow way.
Millionaires evidently. Then the Bolsheviks.
“She had seen her mother murdered and
her brothers taken
out to be shot —
you should have
seen how she said
‘For Liberty !’ She
had been impri-
soned, starved for
a week and then
promised a hang-
ing on the Sunday.
What she suffer 0 '!
before her impri-
sonment I do not
know. What was
her lot before she
was sentenced to
death I can only
guess. She was so
beautiful, so fresh
-—like an English
girl. I thought I
could see some
hints of her great
sufferings in her
eyes as she spoke
to me, but no hints
came from her lips.
What she suffered,
waiting for the
Sunday morning, I could read, later, m
the beat of her temples as her tale developed.
“On the Saturday night before the promised
execution- —you can imagine her condition of
mind and body—a light flashed on her, and
she saw a man in the corner of her cell.
He stepped over to her and lifted her from
the floor, He asked her, in a whisper,
ardently, if she knew him, but she shrank
from him, fearing more horrors.
“The man shook her into an interest in
his story. He had been a boy on her
father’s property —a boy of 20 when she
was 15. He had wanted to go away to
school and she had persuaded her father to
lend him the money to get there. He had
come to help her escape. He was now one
of the financial advisers to the Bolshevik
Government, and he had that morning learned
that she was to be hanged.
“He got her out of prison that night and
put her on a train that took her south. In
the morning, when she had gathered her
senses, she found herself with a revolver
and the keys of two iron safes. Two ordi-
nary office 'safes. They stood in the corner
of the truck behind her. Beside her slept
two men, both drunk. In the far corner
of the truck lay the dead body of a child.
A nice sight first thing in the morning for
that woman, Allen! I wouldn’t like to
wake up to that myself.
“At some little town on the Dnieper she
had to wait three weeks. Three weeks when
eternal vigilance was not only the price of
peace, but the price of life! Eventually
she got down the Dnieper in a boat that
landed her at Odessa. The life on the boat
had been a little better than in the town,
and she had gathered some strength. Life
had begun to be of interest again. She
managed to keep hold of the safes, too.
Nursed them day and night, with the revolver
and keys. Until she got to Odessa. She
had opened them when she was up the
Dnieper and had found them full of jewellery
and plate. Not her own plate, nor her own
jewellery. Somebody else’s. They might
have been the Crown jewels for all she
knew, and the Crown plate.
“She held on to them until she reached
Odessa and then she lost them. That's where
1 enter the story. Dobson, fill Mr. Allen's
glass.... I am afraid I am talking too much
and not attending to”——
“Don’t stop talking to talk about glasses,
man. Go on !” said Allen.
“Well, that’s where I came in, you see.
She had to come ashore to find accommoda-
tion and someone to move the safes, for
the boat was out in the stream. She had
left the safes in charge of the captain—the
new captain who had been second mate
when the voyage began, but who had taken
charge when the captain and mate were
murdered. She had left everything in his
charge. When she went on board again the
safes were gone. So was the captain, and
the quartermaster was dead on the floor of
the chart-room.
“Well, then she came to me. It is some-
thing to represent England in a place like
that. It's a responsibility that you can’t
appreciate until you have a woman like
that come in looking for help. She had come
to the end of her tether, she said, and so
she had come to the Eengleesh capitaine. The
Eengleesh capitaines all over the world were
noted for their clieevalry.
“It was a case of duty and desire coin-
ciding. I told her that I had a staff of 10,
two of them Chinamen, but that we would
find those safes, or perish.”
“And did you?” asked Allen.
“No, I did not, but one of the Chinamen
did. He spilled his blood over one of them
and was found dead in the doorway of the
house where the safes were hidden.
Allen looked across to the writing-desk at
the saiver. The two drops of blood were
still there. He shivered, and, pouring him-
sen. out a tall peg of whisky, swallowed it
near.
“What had happened?” he asked.
I never really knew. We spent two days
on the water-front trying to find the boat that
had brought the safes ashore. My own
theory was that the safes had been rifled
on the ship, and had been apped overboard,
but we gave up that theory when the local
police found the captain’s body in a tri-
butary of the town drain. He had been
stabbed in four places near the heart, and
must have died within a minute of being
struck. Had tliat happened on cue boat he
would have been tipped overboard, and, with
the scour in that harbour, he would have
been out to sea in no time. No, it sug-
gested that he had been murdered on shore,
to get possession of the safes. We searched
every house in the vicinity of that drain.”
“A damned risky job!” said Allen.
“And a damned dirty one, but we worked
only in the daytime, when we could see
around us. On the third day I had offered
a reward to my men, and that night the
two Chinamen went out alone. ‘For ways
that are dark’—you know the quotation.
You can’t beat a Chinaman. Neither for
loyalty, nor for perseverance. Those two
HIS FIRST TIME ALOFT.
“Hey! Cant yer keep th’ Hanky thing still for a minute ?”
boys located the safes. The thieves had
not reckoned on our coming out at nighr
and had been trying to move the safes from
a place we had not searched to one we had.
Oh, we were amateurs, I grant you that.
Yat Sun stumbled on the little job before
he had time to prepare for what came his
way, but Quong Pi was two yards behind
him and dodged the knife that reached out
for him. He saw a knife come through
Yat’s back and he didn’t wait for any further
evidence of his friend’s death. He came
like a shot to me and eight of us were in
that lane inside 15 minutes. Yat’s body
lay where it had fallen. One of the safes
was empty, but the other was intact and we
handed it over to Mme. Chieulff in the
morning. Hence the salver—‘A token of
regard for the Eengleesh capitaine; so poor
little thanks for so great service.’ She sent
it by a messenger.”
Allen turned round and looked at the
salver.
“The blood. How do you explain that?”
he asked.
“Ah, there I teased you a little. Tin
drops of blood are but the reflection of my
Persian lamps that I picked up in Constanti-
nople. You wouldn’t have enjoyed my story
if I had not given it a setting, you know....
Dobson, you might bring the coffee!”
“You’re a damned artistic mariner,” said
Allen, almost resentfully, as he took a prof-
fered liqueur.

at home, ice-cream, etc., and an
ice-chest in which the clean,
cold, dry air keeps every article
for weeks or months if she
needs it.
Just as candles have given way
to electric light, so
has the ice-chest been
superseded by the
Kelvinator. In the
city, the hotel-keeper
or the restaurateur;
and in the suburbs,
the storekeeper and
the housewife; in the
country, the grazier,
the farmer and the
township resident —
all need the Kelvina-
tor.
It brings not only all
the comforts of the
most up-to-date hotel,
but health as well.

Think how often you fail
to enjoy your summer meals
because they are not appetising,
how much food is wasted be-
cause of deterioration from
heat. Kelvinator eliminates
that.
Kelvinator in the home, your
home, means absolute food
economy and hygienic condi-
tions of eating. Clean, cold, dry
air keeps meat sweet for months
if you want it, butter and eggs keep
fresh indefinitely, and the many other
articles which develop that unpleas-
ant, musty flavor in ordi-
nary ice-chests in the
Kelvinator.
Kelvinator air is dry and
clean, and at a constant
degree of cold.
If the ice-man misses you
one day you suffer irri-
tation and inconvenience.
Kelvinator refrigeration
requires no attention;
day and night it keeps
the same degree of cold;
nothing can go wrong
with it.
Send to us for the Kelvi-
nator booklets. Even if
you do not wish to pur-
chase you will be inter-
ested in the sheer clever-
ness of the Kelvinator.
There is no obligation in-
curred and we will be
glad to send you all par-

WHEN I have a little girl I won’t have
a cow.
I have a reason, and this is why and
how.
I’ll have chickens by the dozen and pigs—
stay about,
And don’t for their three meals have to be
boarded out.'
But each day and every day, like a queen so
slow.
.Across the long paddocks the munching
' cow must go.
And all around the world there are little
"iris like me
Leading them to brekkie or home after
tea.
When I have a little girl I won’t have a
cow.
I have a reason, and this is why and how.
I won’t have a brown cow, I won’t have a
white
To spoil my little girl’s play after school
each night.
I wouldn’t think it friendly, I wouldn’t think
it fair,
To end lier game of hop-scotch by calling out :
“Now, Clare,
Run and bring the cow home” —right across
her fun —
“I’m all in a hurry to get the milking done.”
When I have a little girl I won’t have a*
cow.
I have a reason, and this is why and how.
With her heart leaping high but her lips
shut tight,
She’d have to bring it home in the winter
by star light,
When day is almost gone to bed, ‘with
Iveira for its pillow,
And a wind . creeps like an orphan ghost
about the shivering willow.
A 7 o, I won’t have a cow though the King
of Spain should send her
In a ship all of gold with a dragon to defend
her!
When I have a little girl, I won’t have a
cow ;
She won't be always worried like someone
I know now.
And from her bed she will not run through
grass still far from drying
Where mushrooms only half wake up to watch
her bare feet flying.
But dressed in pale pink satin shoes and a
fur coat snowy white,
She’ll ride upon the yellow ’bus to pictures
every night.
She 11 have a dog, she’ll have a horse, some
chickens and a sow,
But I’ll never even mention such a thing to
her as cow !

Coasting.
ALONG swell, a smooth swell! We’re
standing out to sea,
A-steaming past the coastal hills that speak
farewell to me.
The low hills, the high hills, the hazy hills
abeam—
Ah, would I were out on the dear hills!
Glamor and gold and gleam!
A calm sea, a clear sea, unclouded skies
ashine!
We’re steaming past the coastal scrubs, the
scrublands that were mine.
The straight trees, the warped trees, en-
chanted aisles between—
Ah, fain I were out with the green trees!
Shimmer and shine and sheen !
A sweet lass, a dear lass—she will not frei
or pine !
I’m steaming from a lover lass—maybe the
fault was mine.
A proud maid, a harsh maid, her anger will
endure—
Ah, would I were out with a lost maid !
Laughter and lo.ve and lure!
A long lane, a blue lane to Java leads away;
I’m steaming north—a sailorman—a-heave-o
and a-J^ey!
Oh, I shall fondle fairer hands
And fairer lips cede my demands;
But where shall I find fairer lands
A-heave-o and a-hey !

And at the End.
ONCE on a gallant morning,
With the blue sky blowing apart,
Each bud broke on my eyelids,
Each bird flew through my heart!
I prayed for the faith of a starling
Under the taAvny trees,
A child, or a holy woman—
What could be greater than these?
But now on a heavy morning,
With the dull skv blowing apart,
When no flower blesses my eyelids
And no wing brushes my heart,
I, made surer by sorrow,
Beg what seems more to me:
The faith of a willow in winter,
Or a blind hound nosing the knee!

First Love.
WHEN I went home to Silverwood
I heard your laughter calling.
Like sunlight round me where I stood
Pale blossom flame was falling,
Blown wattle-gold was falling
In Silverwood.
The sky was like a fairy-well
Of lucent azure burning;
Aloof, a bellbird tolled his bell*
The echo far returning.
And on my heart returning
Came back youth’s spell-.
Ah. yet, though all was fair to sOO
With green and golden glimmer,
A light was gone from frond and tree
That left the morning dimmer,
The paths of childhood dimmer
Than memory!
I trod the leafy track I knew
By hidden waters singing.
Past boughs of gold the skies were blue;
Yet all my thoughts went winging—
First love o’ mine, went winging—
Back, back to you !
I sought your lichened gate again
Beyond the mountain’s shoulder;
But lonely now the wattles reign
Beneath a sky grown colder—
Ah! heart V me, grown colder
With strange, swift pain !
Dear, past the nets the blind fates spin
You laughed, aloof from sorrow,
For some far joy our souls shall win
On death’s unshadowed morrow—
Death’s dream-enchanted morrow—
To you seemed kin.
Our love held naught of bitterness,
No shadow blind and tragic—
A childish song whose gay caress
Seemed blown from glens of magic,
Of green and tranquil magic
None else might guess.
O little girl, lost long ago,
To that dark hillside turning
Late, late, where naught but lichens grow,
I saw a ghost light burning !
God! liow steadfastly burning
Your candle glow!
When I went home to silverwood
Blown wattle-gold was falling.
Dear heart, where once long since we stood
And heard the bellbirds calling
I heard you calling, calling
In Silverwood !

Song.
O r I, will you walk in Mangere upon a
morn in spring?
(Oh, green the fields and clean the fields
Beneath a silver rain !)
And you shall have a flowery crown for sweet
adventuring
If you will come to Mangere upon a morn in
spring
And hear the bells of chiming birds across
the harbor ring
In a sweet, shrill refrain.
If you will walk in Mangere upon a summer
morn
(Oh, white the sands and bright the sands
Beneath a soaring sun!)
You will hear strange sea-music upon the
long winds borne;
And know that all sea-kings are out and
driving in the morn,
Steering their high foam-chariots, by racing
breezes torn,
Out where the wild tides run.
Now will you walk in Mangere upon an
autumn day?
(Oh, fleet the winds and sweet the winds
That through the orchards sough!)
And you may pluck the berries red and
brambles by the way
If you will rest in Mangere upon an autumn
day,
YYlien all the land is mellowing and, brave
as pennants gay,
The red fruit hangs on the bough.

VY ltli domes and spires that pierce the crystal

Litt lovely minarets from misty groves.
E°r Eastern essences, I have green mint
And lemon leaves and lilac without stint.
No sugared fruits in bowls of filigree,
But purple plums and peaches from the tree;
No martial music trumpeting at dawn.
But magpies singing clear across the lawn-

Looking Forward.
WHAT shall I do, my dai’ling, when
Implacable Spring comes by again
\\ ith birdsong and boronia’s breath,
And sure to me as man’s sure death
The knowledge that your love is gone—
What shall 1 stay my heart upon?
Where shall I turn to hide from you?
Little red leafbuds sticky-new
And eager blue wrens that trail a stem
Of couchgrass busily after them—
Every knot of Spring’s silk mesh
Must bind my heart to pain afresh.
Eastward through scents and sounds that
ache
With sweetness of honey in bush and brake,
Blindly I’ll turn me, hastening
Towards the sea that knows no Spring,
And where the indifferent combers roll
Bathe mind and body and desperate soul.
Salt of our blood and tears is kin
To salt of the sea that watched Life begin i
Her cold voice is less fell than earth’s
Harlequin round of deaths and births
And loves containing each: in her
Perhaps I’ll find a comforter.
WTiat shall I do when Spring comes by,
Love being dead? I shall not cry
To you, but till my eyes are clear
111 turn my back on the sweet o’ the year.
We share no memories of the sea. .. .'
You nearly could be proud of me!

0? the numberless nights that the life-
giving sunlight pursueth,
Is there any so barren that day shall not
wake in its womb?
And the year that is stricken by winter the
springtime renewetli,
But neither the sun nor the spring may
enlighten the tomb.
Nay, neither the sun nor the spring, but the
soul of the dead there—
Which is but the memory men may retain
of this man—
Shall awaken to life when a friend’s thoughts
are suddenly led there,
For thought shall outlive us that knew us
before we began.
Shall you say that the worshippers worship
the stones of their altar?
Nay, the root of the flower, the lute of
the player, are nought;
And a flag may fly on though the feet of the
flagbearer falter,
For where is there love save the love of
a beautiful thought?

Enlightenment.
ISAW a wild bird flash through the air;
And I understood
Why men will sever old ties to fare
On the unknown ways, will rush elate
To hazard a losing battle with fate
And And it good.
I felt the clasp of an old friend’s hand ;
And there came to me
A deeper faith in my native land,
The faith of an ultimate brotherhood,
When all shall strive for a nation’s good
In days to be.
I saw a woman bending low
O’er her sick child’s bed ;
And she showed me a mother of long ago.
I knew her grief in that hour of loss.
As she watched her Son on a rough-hewn
cross
With thorn-crowned head.

Often she came, but paler grew,
Though always he brought her his choicest

Honey as fresh as the morning dew,
Flowers as pure as Alpine drift
(But he would not ask her in) ;
And a thin hand pressed her bosom a while
As she took what he gave with a wistful

One eve she came by the hermit’s gate—
Lovelier still, so frail and fair.
He leaned across and talked till late,
And toyed with the tea-tree bloom in her

As, sipiling, she left him to find her rest.

Not wrongs I ■wrought when overbold,
But things of every day,
Filed high with evils manifold,
At last shall bulk more large than they,
I have been caught, unthinking, gay,
In every web the Devil spins.
For these shall Hell my soul affray?....
God will forgive my little sins.

_On whom each trembling mortal pins

Plants
will bring
advantages
you all the
of electricity
Whether you live on farm or station, you can make it a better place
to live with electricity. Electricity provides the same comforts and
conveniences enjoyed in the city. It makes work easy and gives you
more leisure and freedom. It gives you light cheaply and power
cheaply.
Ask yourself these questions: Do I want electricity? The answer
must be yes. What do I want most from a lighting plant? Simplicity,
so that it won’t go wrong; dependability, quietness, cleanliness and
safety, so that I won’t have any worry. Those are the features of
Westinghouse plants, made by a company which is the largest
manufacturer of electrical appliances in the world, having an employee
list of 44,000; and you might be sure that the Lighting Plant they
manufacture embodies all the latest improvements known to electrical
science, and will in every way maintain the high standard of efficiency
which the name “Westinghouse” implies.
Can you afford it? You can afford to run it because it is as cheap as kerosene. You cart
afford to buy it because our terms system is absurdly easy. Ju3t think what it will give you.
Lighting first, then power—for sawing, pumping, milking, separating, grinding, sweeping,
washing, ironing and the sewing-machine, as well as many other tasks. It can give you the means
of combating fire and of having running water by providing power for an automatic pressure
water system. It will provide power for electric fans and also run the Kelvinator. You cannot
help wanting it, and it s all so easy to obtain Have you investigated the wonderful guarantees
given with the installation of a “WESTINGHOUSE” LIGHT and POWER PLANT?
Tell us the sort of work you could use a plant for, and we will tell you the type, size and price
of the plant you need, as well as how you can pay for it while you use it. Write for the Westing-
house book—it will interest you, and does not obligate you in any way.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
IT was Saturday afternoon, and Benson,
district magistrate at Mohari, decided
to make it a holiday in fact as well as
in theory. The warm wind of the monsoon,
heavy with fragrance, bleAv softly, stirring
the fronds of the coco-palms, and rippling
the sun-kissed waters of the bay so that they
seemed to flash Avith light. Benson stepped
gingerly over the split-palm verandah floor
and settled himself comfortably in the resi-
dency’s only serviceable lounge. By his side
was a bundle of month-old newspapers, and
within easy reach stood a battered brass
gong, for 4 o’clock tea is an institution even
on a Papuan out-station. He read undis-
turbed for half an hour, then swore softly
at the sound of heavy footsteps crunching
the broken coral on the garden path.
“Anybody at home?” boomed a voice from
the garden.
“Come in, Padre,” invited Benson. “Mind
the floor; the old shack is a bit dickey in
spots.”
Benson had no illusions regarding nxission-
ai-ies in general, but long ago he had men-
HE WAS THAT SORT OF MAN.
LADY : “I want a careful chauffeu r, one who won’t take any risks."
APPLICANT: “Mum, I’m that careful I even want me salary in
advance."
tally classified the Rev. Septimus Jenkins
as anothei kind. Broad-minded, good-
liumored, cultured and very tolerant, ‘ Jenks”
was a man who believed in minding his own
business. And to such Iclencs much is for-
given m I apua. .
The newcomer seated himself on an up-
turned kerosene-case and fanned himself with
his helmet.
“I say, R.M.,” he began diffidently. “I
hope you Won t think that Im butting in
or anything like that; but can t you do some-
r Wlt ,h Biat f e JJp w Bonovan *
hat s wrong . asked Benson coldly,
Has lie been playing up again .
Jenkins nodded. There was another dis-
gusting affair at the village last night,
he replied. Donovan, mad-drunk and half-
naked, hunting that woman of his with a
lawyer-cane; threatening to shoot the pigs
and fire the houses. Really, Benson, if I
hadn’t gone down and pacified him I believe
there would have been the deuce to pay.
Honestly, old man, I think you ought to
deal with him.”
Benson filled his pipe thoughtfully. “I
suppose you’re right, Jenkins,” he said. He
paused, and appeared to be ruminating pro-
foundly. Then, as though having made a
decision, he spoke again.
“I think I’ll give you the strength of Dono-
van. You’re a good chap, and perhaps you’ll
understand why I allow him a lot of rope.
Years ago I served under Donovan in the
old Mambare Division. I Avas a fledgling
patrol-officer; Donovan Avas R.M. of the
division. lie was a good officer in those
days; solid as a rock; loyal to his friends
and high in the confidence of the Adminis-
tration.”
He stopped to light his pipe, puffed silently
for a AAdiile and resumed.
“The laburi people had been giving a lot
of trouble —-raiding the miners’ camps, spear-
ing their ‘boys’ and raising merry hell gen-
erally. Donovan, quite off his own bat, de-
cided to take in a patrol and straighten
things out. Nobody knows what really hap-
pened, but something went wrong—damnably
wrong—during a night attack on a mountain
village. Some fool gave the order to fire;
the police got out of hand; Donovan was
not on the spot, and when he entered the
village the following morning to clean up
the mess he found the mutilated bodies of two
native women and a child—bayoneted by the
police. That Avas the stone-end of Donovan.
The crowd down south got hold of the story
7 —your people were in it, Jenkins —twisted
it to suit their own ends, and Donovan sent
in his papers lest worse should befall him.
“He had a wife on the station—a blue-
eyed, fair-haired slip of a girl; just a kid
really. We got her down safely to Mamba
Beach, and she died there —she and her little
son, born before his time. God, Jenkins!
When I think of my own wife and kiddies
in Australia, I feel very thankful and very
humble.”
He knocked out his pipe savagely, and
stamped on the glowing ashes.
“There isn’t much more,” he continued.
“ ‘Out of the service, out of the country,’
is a pretty good motto for magistrates.
If Donovan had
acted on it he
might have been
wharf-lumping or
pushing a pen for
a crust on the
other side. What
else are we fit for,
anyhow? Donovan
decided to give
New Guinea an-
other fly. He
knew the country
and the people.
Knew them too
well, as it turned
out.”
Benson rose and
tapped the gong.
Then he resumed
his seat.
“All this hap-
pened years ago,
Jenkins, and I am
R.M. of the West-
Central division,
and Jim Dono\'an,
whom I used to
‘Sir’—w e 11, you
saw last night
what Donovan has
become—a drunken,
dissolute combo,
loafing on the vil-
lage, demoralising
the natives, fit only
to be deported
under the Vag-
rancy Ordinance.”
Jenkins coughed
uncomfortably. “I
say, old man,” he
commenced and
his voice Avas gentle
—can’t we—both of
us, I mean—can’t
we”
“I’m afraid we can do nothing,” broke in
Benson. “I’ve pleaded with him, I’ve pro-
tected him, I’ve even jeopardised my iob for
him; but his case is pretty hopeless. I’ll go
over at sundown, when he has sobered up
a bit, and ‘talk strong’ about last night’s
affair. Poor old beggar! God, what a sweet
country this is
* “ ' * * #
Scattered along the Papuan beaches, from
Daru to the Mitre Rock, wherever a belt of
coeoanuts or a populous village promises an
easy livelihood, there is a small army of dead-
beats who, having lightly shouldered the
white man’s burden, have wilted under the
load, and have fallen by the wayside. And
0 f all that sorrowful brotherhood there was
not one so sunk in utter worthlessness as
Jim Donovan, sometime R.M. of the Mam-
bare Division.
Clad only in a tattered cotton singlet and
sweat-stained khaki trousers, unshaven and
unwashed, he was not a pleasant sight as
he lay, drunk, in front of the ramshackle,
palm-tliatched humpy he called his trading-
station. He cleared his throat and began to
sing tunelessly a ribald ballad of the beach:
“If y’ tired of town life, and y’ wantin’ a wife,
Come to Pap-u-a!
If y’ fond of the sea, and of fine sceneree,
Come to Pap-u-a!”
He broke oft as a powerfully-built native,
carrying a caddy of tobacco and a heavy
trade-box, came into view. The “boy”
looked neither to the right nor to the left,
but, as he came abreast, Donovan recognised
Boruka, a local man, who some twelve
months ago had left the village to “sign-on,”
and was now returning with the results of
his year's labor. Donovan
hailed him joyfully.
“Goo’-day. Boruka ! Come
here. I want to talk.”
The “boy” dropped his
load and regarded Donovan
sullenly.
“What you want, Dono-
van ?” he asked.
“Donovan!” said the
white man wonderingly.
“Donovan! Here! S’pose
you talk me, you swine, you
say taubada [master], you
savee?”
Boruka laughed con-
temptuously. “Taubada!” he
sneered. “I savee fashion
b’long proper white man,
and I savee fashion b’long
you. You no taubada, Dono-
van ; you combo, tha’s all!”
Before the white man
could formulate a reply
Boruka had raised his cal-
loused foot and kicked him
viciously. Donovan rolled
over with a groan, and again
and yet again the native
kicked him, until, every
muscle of his drink-sodden
body in torture, he crawled
under a poinciana-tree and
wept weakly. Then with a
jeer Boruka resumed his journey.
The sun, poised above the horizon, was
turning the sea into gold when Donovan
came to himself. He sensed dimly the mea-
sure of his degradation. He, Donovan,
whose very name had once inspired terror
amongst the fighting tribes of the hinter-
land, to be kicked like a dog by a scaly
coastal nigger! He groaned in bitterness
of spirit. Were there no means by which
he might, raise himself from the pit of in-
famy into which he had long ago plunged?
A new light flickered into his eyes, and, filled
with self-loathing, he rose painfully and en-
tered the house.
Goada, his native “wife,” her lips stained
with the crimson juice of the betel-nut,
slammed a bottle of whisky and a tin panni-
kin on the table. The familiar craving
gripped his thi’oat, tortuiung every nerve.
“No!” he muttered. “Not this time, by
God!” And he flung the bottle through the
open doorway, to hear it smash to fragments
on the coral below.
“Wha’s matter, Jim?” asked the woman
curiously. “You sick, hey?”
“Yes, Goada, I’m sick,” replied Donovan.
“Sick to death!”
He lurched unsteadily into the store and
brought out a box of tobacco.
“Take this, Goada,” he said. “We finish,
you and me—finish altogether. Savee?”
“I bin finish long time, Donovan,” replied
the woman. “No money, no kaikai; whisky,
tha’s all. I”
“That’ll do,” said Donovan. “Clear out!”
When the sound of her retreating foot-
steps. had died away, Donovan stripped, and,
running heavily across the shingle, plunged
into the sea. He felt a thrill of exultation
as the cool waters closed over his head. For
ten minutes he swam vigorously; then, every
nerve tingling and his body glowing, he re-
entered the house.
From the store he dragged out a heavy
camphor-wood box. It had not been so
much as opened for years. He burst the
lock with an iron bar, and regarded the con-
tents thoughtfully.
“Kicked by a lousy nigger!” he muttered.
“Good Lord!”
* * * *
At Mohari the women were kindling the
fires under the cooking-pots for the evening
meal. Close at hand, Boruka, surrounded
by a crowd of admiring friends, was proudly
displaying his treasures, and bragging of
his exploits in the mysterious settlements
of the white man.
“I am another kind man, my brothers,”
he wound up boastfully. “And to-day I have
fought a white man, and kicked him so that
he crawled away, weeping like a woman.
To-night I will make a new song, and my
sons and my sons’ sons shall call me Helalia
Tauna [The Kicker].”
An old man, standing on the outskirts of
the crowd, laughed jeeringly, displaying
betel-stained, toothless gums.
“You talk like a fool, Boruka,” he said.
“Were not the spears of our fathers dipped
in the blood of white men in the old days?
And did aught but evil come of it? I, who
have worn the clothes of a ribbon police-
man [armed constable] and have fought
bushmen on the big rivers of the North with
this very man Donovan, tell you that you
are a fool.”
He discharged a stream of crimson-flecked
saliva from the corner of his mouth, and
added, sententiously:
“All white men have many malignant
devils at their command. You, Boruka, who
are a kavakava iauna [ignoramus], know
nothing of these things.”
Boruka slapped his naked thigh exult-
antly. “Nevertheless, old one. I kicked the
UNEXPECTED SUPPORT .
MR. SKITER ( relating last night's experience) : “Yes—
’n' when the two desperate burgulars approached
our bedroom I was perfectly cool — wasn't I,
Phyllis?"
MRS. SKITER: “In fact, cold, John —your teeth were
chattering !"
white man Donovan so that he wept. I”
He stopped in wonderment, as he saw the
old man straighten his withered frame and
salute shakily. The crowd grew strangely
silent. Even the shrill chatter of the women
ceased abruptly. Boruka turned his head
and found himself staring, fascinated, into
the cold, merciless eyes of the white man he
had humiliated that afternoon. But Donovan
seemed strangely different from the derelict
he had left squirming shamefully under the
poinciana on the beach. He had discarded
his filthy rags for the conventional white
drill of the white man. He was washed and
shaved. His chest was out and his shoulders
squared, and he seemed to have miraculously
cast off the miserable degradation of his
vagabond years.
Donovan’s hands opened and shut.
“Get ready, Boruka,” he said, softly. “We
are going to fight—you and I.”
The native quailed under the menace of
the white man’s eyes. Nevertheless he
placed himself in a posture of defence, for
he was game enough, and he saveed the ways
of white men. Donovan lashed out with his
left and caught Boruka under the jaw, rock-
ing him sideways.
“That for the kick in the ribs, Boruka!”
he whispered.
The blow seemed to galvanise the native
into action. He staggered back, and then,
with head down, rushed at the white man,
his arms swinging like flails. Donovan real-
ised that he must keep his adversary
from coming to grips. If those powerful
brown hands found his throat the fight would
end in only one way. He stepped lightly to
one side, and got in a smashing blow as the
native lurched by. Boruka was breathing
heavily. He reeled round in sudden helpless-
ness, and Donovan, swinging Avith his right,
stretched him senseless on the ground.
The. natives looked on in silence. Dono-
vhn gave a short, almost hysterical laugh.
“Now, you people,” he said, thickly, “you
savee?”
“We savee, taubada,” they chorused; and
again the ancient ex-policeman straightened
himself and saluted.
Donovan turned aAvay. His whole spirit
seemed warmed by a new, exultant glow.
He felt that even he, the waster, the down-
and-out, might at last shake off the soul-
destroying apathy which had held him in a
mex-ciless grip since the death of his wife on
Mamba Beach so many years ago.
Busy with his thoughts, he did not recog-
nise the white-clad figure of Benson, who,
hidden among the trees, had watched with
approving eyes his encounter with Boruka.
The magistrate stepped out and accosted
Donovan.
“Doing anything to-night, Jim?” he asked,
casually.

Donovan laughed without mirth, and faced
his old-time subordinate squarely.
“What’s the game, Benson?” he asked. “If
you and that fool-parson have fixed it up be-
tween you to shift me out of the district, you
may go ahead. The first boat for Moresby,
if you like.”
“The fact is,” replied Benson, carefully
ignoring the other’s outburst, “Jenkins, who
is staying with me, suggested a game of
euchre, and I thought that, perhaps, you
might come up to dinner and join us.”
Donovan caught his breath.
“I—are you serious, Benson?” he ex-
claimed, brokenly. “Dinkum? An utterly
worthless human mongrel like”
“Of course I’m serious.” Benson passed
his arm around the older man’s shoulders.
“I’ve been waiting for this day for years,
old friend,” he said.
G. M. TURNBULL.
Discipline.
[FIR THE BULLETIN.]
ONLY the pounding dug of the ship’s
engines broke the stillness of the
calm. In the shady spots sailors off
watch dozed on the clean-washed decks. Be-
low on the mess-deck an enterprising A.B.
was shaving and haircutting at 3d. a time,
while here and there the hum of a sewing-
machine beat out an overture to long leave.
H.M.S. Poonah was homeward bound after
three years’ service with the China squad-
ron. She had crossed the Indian, rounded
the Cape and punched her way up into the
tropics of the Atlantic. • Overhead was a
sky of cornflower blue. On the starboard
side, scarcely visible in the blue haze, was
a little bit of ragged land—part of the Afri-
can Gold Coast. All was peace. The crew
was happy. Sweethearts, homes and wives
were but a few days away.
Eight-bells of the afternoon watch struck.
Then the thing happened. The engine-room
telegraph clanged imperatively. The engine-
room artificer jumped to the throstle in
amazement. The indicator swung over to
full astern and then wagged over to stop.
With a shudder the ship hove to midst a
wash of foam.
“What’s the matter?”
The question ran up and down the mess-
deck. The cook emerged from the galley and
asked the steward; the steward asked
the corporal; the corporal and a score
of men passed the question on to the master-
at-arms. Nobody knew. From the three
funnels of the ship the smoke drifted straight
upwards like three emphatic exclamation-
marks, expressing surprise and concern at
the extraordinary turn of events.
Ten minutes later the answer began to
filter through the ship in a whisper: “The
captain says he wants to sleep and the
engines keep him awake.” Having digested
this astonishing piece of news the men began
to look at each other and wonder what was
going to happen next. The oldest salt among
them could not remember a ship being
stopped at sea to allow the captain to have
his afternoon nap.
The steward was alive to the situation in
a trice. He was known to the ship’s com-
pany as Crippen. Did Crippen see any two
talking in low tones he must creep up and
listen; did a mysterious circumstance arise,
he must investigate every scintilla of evi-
dence. Mystery kept him alive and on the
hop. Now he crept up to the captain's cabin
and began to polish up the brass on the
deck portholes. His bird-like little eye was
at work. When he returned to the men he
said in awe, “He’s asleep.”
Caught unawares, the officers regarded the
position in a more serious light. Lieutenant
Cortes was the only one who treated the
situation at all flippantly. He stooped down
to the piano he had been leaning against and
banged out the first chords of the Dead
March. ....
“What the devil are you playing that for t
interrupted Dr. Gale.
“That’s the tune they'll play over me when
my engine stops,” answered Cortes.
But for once the little doctor failed to
appreciate the humor of his brother-officer.
This was no time for joking. _
Lieutenant Rivers burst into the ward-
room with the light of battle in his < eye.
“What damn fool was playing that?” he
ripped out, glaring at the obvious culprit.
“I believe he means me,” drawled Cortes.
“Amusin’ the jolly old staff, what?”
Lieutenant Rivers paced the room angrily.
“It’s a two-knot current if it's an inch.
Three hours ’ll put us ashore,” he said,
addressing Cortes. “After the captain you’re
responsible,” he declared heatedly.
“Then, why should you worry?” blandly
replied Cortes without leaving the porthole.
The doctor wriggled about in his chair
as if he would like to apply the stethoscope
to the heart of things. “If I were an execu-
tive officer, I know what I’d do,” came his
outburst.
“Interested, eh, Doc.?” murmured Cortes
smiling. “Orders are orders, you know, and
captains are captains.”
“Fiddlesticks!” ejaculated the doctor.
“You intend to let the ship drift?” de-
manded Rivers.
“To perdition,” replied Cortes, unmoved
by the anger of his junior officer.
“Then I won’t!” Rivers emphasised his
challenge with a resounding thump of his
clenched fist on the table.
Cortes’s retort was quick and to the point.
“I am responsible for your actions, Mr.
Rivers. Don’t force me to remind you that
I am your senior officer.”
“Oh, damn!” exclaimed the doctor. “If
you’re going to fight better get ready
to do the repair work.” Whereupon he with-
drew ; flint was striking steel with a very
big chance of producing fire.
Crippen was sleuthing for news with his
eye glued to the key-hole of the wardroom
door. Shortly after the doctor’s exit he
almost doubled down to the mess-deck burst-
ing with some information he had gathered.
“They’re at it, ’ammer an’ tongs,” he
breathlessly told the men. “I see Jimmy the
One (Cortes) clout the Gunner (Rivers)
a real snorter. He went down like a sack
o’ flour. I think he was clean outed.”
Now the crew began to get a little per-
turbed. Discipline was in their bones, and
even the boldest spirit didn't dream of making
a move to check the inevitable drift of the
ship. To disobey an officer was nothing less
than mutiny. Loss of pensions, dismissal
and a thousand other tragedies followed such
rash acts.
CROSS WORDS.
ARDENT LOVER: “Say the two words that will send me into Heaven."
TARDY MISS : “Prussic acid."
Superstition is always very near the
sailor’s mind. The unfathomable is un-
fathomable, except that there may be some
supernatural, cause at the back of it. That
is what one has to watch, reasons the sailor.
It was clear that some strange hoodoo had
struck the ship. Jimmy the One was fight-
ing Rivers, and no one. as far as the men
knew, cared a button whether the ship went
ashore or not.
They argued among themselves. The day
was dying; the shore was appreciably nearer ;
and the ship was unnaturally quiet. Most
of the stokers had come on deck. They stood
like lost sheep about the engine-room hatch-
way, and spoke in short sentences at inter-
vals. There was an atmosphere of wmiting
about everything.
Presently one of the men said: “It'll be
dark soon.”
“It gets dark quickly here,” remarked an-
other, who knew the tropics.
“Not ’arf it don’t,” agreed a Cockney.
“Night comes down like a lid on a pot—
click!”
So they began to contemplate the possi-
bility of drifting ashore in the dark. Each
one had already collected his treasures into
a little bundle, and was prepared for the
w r orst.
Lieutenant Cortes had left the wardroom
and was now sitting in a deck-chair amid-
ships, quite unperturbed and apparently well
satisfied with the world. And the ship
drifted on and on and nearer and nearer
the shore.
Of all aboard the steward showed the most,
animation. He was enjoying himself in
solving the problem, but was striking some
minor difficulties in trying to learn what
had happened to Lieutenant Rivers, who
remained in the wardroom. Cut off from a
keyhole view by the watchful gaze of Jimmy the
One, the fussy little man discovered that he
could gain the information by leaning over
from the upper deck and peeping through
the porthole. After tying a rope to his leg
to lessen the risk, he lowered himself cau-
tiously until his eyes came level with the
port. “S’help me!” he stammered, his eyes
popping with amazement. Then the rope
slipped at the knot, and he fell with his hair
dangling in the water. By a supreme effort
he managed to lift his head free and give
one long frantic cry of “Man overboard .
Rushing to the side the crew beheld lam
swinging and struggling like a huge
frog on a string. “It’s Crippen, they de-
clared with malicious delight. "He's trying
to get away from us!” Then they fished him
out while Lieutenant Cortes watched with
his eyes crinkling in a smile.
On noticing Jimmy the One Crippen col-
lapsed and managed to groan as they car-
ried him away aft. Once beyond the earshot
of the officer he became a different man.
“Wot d’yer think?” he chortled, kicking
himself free from his rescuers. “Rivers is
tied up like a trussed turkey—bound ’and
an’ foot and gagged, too!”
“What did he say?” asked the cook.
“Wot could he say—gagged like he was?
He just looked —suprised like.”
“Any’ow, it’s an officers’ row, an’ I say
leave ’em to it. They began it an’ they can
finish it,” said the cook.
“An’ I knows some more, too,” emphasised
the steward. “It comes ter me like a flash
w’en I falls in the ditch. I sees it orl clear
as day why the capt’n can’t sleep and orl
that.” He paused and looked up to make
sure that all were listening. “Why can’t
he sleep?” he asked, pushing his face for-
ward dramatically. Then lowering his voice
he answered himself: “Beeos he killed a
Chink.”
The crew recalled how Captain Wellesley
had killed a Chinaman who had run amok
iust before 11.M.5. Poonah had sailed from
China. A blow from his fist had put an
end to the madman’s career. None had been
more surprised than the captain that a man
should die so easily. Now the affair was
revived. .
The shore drifted nearer, and the sinking
sun lengthened the shadows. Night came
and the coast swung closer, ominous and
dark.
“A coupla miles,” murmured the cook, an
any minute we might get It.”
They began to talk of reefs and rocks and
treacherous coastlines. They expressed the
final expected bump as “It.” “It” was a
personal and live thing waiting somewhere
in the dark for them. “It” would get them
in the end.
Crippen.
All listened to the monotonous drone of
the leadsman’s voice recording the depth.
This naval routine was being carried out
with the usual care. The depth varied con-
siderably. But often it was only a few
fathoms. Already the ship was swaying to
the influence of the ground swell, and the
plates were creaking eerily in a kind of arti-
culate protest.
The low moan of the surf breaking on the
shore came to them with the first stirring
of the land breeze and the lurching of the
ship became more pronounced.
“The ole man’s mad,” growled the cook.
“I knew he was w’en ’e arskt fer ’errin’s fer
breakfast, as if he didn’t know ’errin’s fin-
ished three weeks ago.”
“Sleepin’ while the old hooker runs ashore,
that’s wot ’e’s doin’,” • protested a seaman.
“He’ll be beached fer this, as sure as I’m
Stripie, A. 8.”
They gathered around the lifeboats and
began to test the tackle while the shadowy
shore loomed higher and higher like a moun-
tain that threatened to blot out all else.
Peering into the inky mass the men tried to
learn the ship’s proximity to the shore. A
sailor drew a bucket of sea-water from a
pump and poked his hand into it. “Cold as
ice!” he complained. “Wliat chance ’d a
man have? None —an’ ’e wouldn't want any,
neither he would.” But there was humor,
too. Mick the Stoker didn’t mind the water
being icy. He had squared “Old Nick” for
“a good possie in Hell.” He had no objec-
tion to being frozen to death as long as he
was going to be thawed to life.
Now at regular intervals they could hear
distinctly the low wash of the surf on the
beach —or was it on a reef? They argued
this fine point. Their ears had been trained
ki many waters. They knew the story of the
waves, but the ship’s dynamo engine made
translation difficult.
“Seven fathoms,” droned the leadsman in
a voice that jolted tin; crew to action. The
sounding was the lowest recorded. In. a body
the men moved to the boats, and simul-
taneously Jimmy the One appeared on the
scene.
“Stand back, stand back!” he commanded,
and even as the men hesitated between two
opinions the engine-room telegraph rang
and with the churning of the screw the ship
began slowly to move out to sea.
“Splendid! But close —very close,”
breathed Jimmy the One as he tried to pierce
the black mass' that loomed seemingly a few
yards from the stern.
“ ‘Splendid’ ?” repeated the men. “What
did he mean?”
The steward was puzzled. There was some
mystery somewhere, but he’d nose it out. No
one could put it over,Adolphus Henry Boggs
this real name, if you please) for long.
Ple’d catch ’em. He turned in shortly after-
wards and spent a restless night trying to
solve the problem.
It was next morning that Crippen got his
first clue outside the doctor’s cabin.
“I got the ’ang uv it all now,” he told
the cook. “I hear the doctor say, ’Strange
things ’appen when men give orders in their
sleep.’ So I puts two an’ two together an’
I sees how the Ole Man slipped yest’y. If
he didn’t walk in ’is sleep, how was he asleep
a minute after w’en I peeps in on him?”
“There’s somethin’ at the back uv it,”
agreed the cook, as he polished up his pots
outside the galley.
So Crippen sowed the seed of solution.
Half an hour afterwards all the crew knew
that the captain was a somnambulist. The
mess-deck buzzed with comment.
“So that’s what they say?” mused Captain
Wellesley when the story reached the ward-
room. “Cortes, you’d better tell ’em”
liis voice trailed off as if he were at a loss_ to
finish the sentence. “Oh, tell ’em anything
you like —anything but the truth.”
“I like that,” was the smiling rebuke of
Jimmy the One. “Puts the blame on me!”
“What was I to do?” protested the captain.
“I don’t mind a man stowing away aboard
my ship. But a woman! Damn it, man,
wiiat would they have said at Portsmouth?”
Coi’tes whistled and hummed a music-hall
air. “We had to dispose of the body-
alive,” he said. “And I did it. She got
ashore all right—and even Crippen missed
everything.”
“You’re a gem, Cortes,” exclaimed the
captain warmly. “It would have gone
through the fleet like wildfire—a black
woman, too! I can hear them spinning the
story in the ward-rooms! And the official
inquiry!” His voice trailed off again.
Five minutes later Lieutenant Cortes
addressed the men on the quarter-deck. At
the end of a rather picturesque oration,_ he
said. “It was the captain’s idea of an original
discipline test, and he made it seem danger-
ous to tune you up a bit. He’s very pleased
with your magnificent behavior.”
“Oh, is he?” murmured the cook. But
Cortes failed to hear the comment.
“If the capt’n hadn’t killed a Chink I d
ha’ guessed it from the start,” declared
EDIUAR A. AUJARD.

Chains.
[FOR THE BULLE TIN.]
IN the Dulooloo bar-room four men sat on
a low form. They smoked silently,
meditatively, until Bill Gowan lifted the
pipe from his lips and dreamily spat on
the floor. The sight of his gratuitous con-
tribution on the spotless boards awoke him
suddenly to the enormity of his offence.
Stealthily he moved his foot on to the offen-
sive spot and endeavored to rub it in. To
cover his confusion he threw out an item
of news which he hoped would prove of
general interest.
“Seen Mrs. Carew going down the Kar-
rara-road in Bales’s car. Mus’ be goin’
away.”
Tinder, the hotelkeeper, offered to eluci-
date the mystery. “She’s going to the Hill-
top Stevens. They’ve got a parson coming
out to christen the new baby and they’ve
got her for godmother or somethin’.”
“Oh, well, I reckon it will be a nice little
’oliday for Bruce. And if ever a man needed
one it’s ’im,” continued Gowan, gratified
to find that his host had either not seen
his mistake or was content to let it pass.
Removing the pipe from his mouth he be-
came suddenly loquacious. “I ’member Bruce
Carew fifteen years ago, and a nice chap,
too. played poler with the toffs
and was captain of the Dulooloo cricket and
footer teams, too ; and, don’t forget, footer here
was pretty willin’ fifteen years ago. ’Course
he was like the rest of the Carews, alius
without a , bean to bless ’isself; but ’e was
a man —a man’s man. And now look at
him —nothing but a lady-help, as you might
say. Sunday after he was married one of
the chaps' went up to get him to liuinpire
—not to play, mind you; just humpire. Out
comes her skinny neck round the door.
‘Don’t forget that you’ve some domestic
duties, Bryce, that you’ve not yet performed.’
Performed!” Gowan repeated bitterly. “If
he’d ha performed then there’d ha bin no
more of this lady-’elp business.”
Tinder ‘got up laughing and went behind
the bar. “That yarn’s about twelve years
old, Bill,” he said.
“I know that,” responded Bill evenly;
“there wouldn’t ha’ been any point to it if
it ’ad ’appened yesterday. It was the start,
and it was just there she got him under her
thumb, and for twelve years there she’s ’eld
’im.”
And then Bruce Carew came in. He had
allowed the' fat little unshod mare to travel
at her own pace along the dandelion-covered
roadside, and no one in the bar was aware
of their almost silent approach. He had
dismounted lazily, and while Nettie grazed
had adjusted a broken stirrup-leather.
As he walked into the bar, Mrs. Tinder
looked up and smiled brightly at him. She
had a very L soft spot in her heart for this
dear, handsome young fellow with the vixen-
ish wife. But instantly she saw that some-
thing was wrong, for there was no answering
smile, and the dull tan of hist face seemed to
have grown a shade darker. “He heard!
He heard it all,” whispered Mrs. Tinder’s,
woman-wit, and her heart gave a little
anxious quiver.
He ignored the men, but from the little
fibre bag that he carried he drew out a
pound of butter neatly wrapped in clean,
damp muslin and handed it to Mrs. Tinder.
“You shouldn’t have bothered,” she said
nervously. Something in his face was hurt-
ing her. She longed to be able to think of
something kind—something that would take
that look out of his face. Bill Gowan —
she’d tell Bill Gowan a thing or two later.
Tell him that he wasn’t fit to lick Bruce
Carew’s boots.
“It was very good of you to have brought
it,” she said, her voice sweet with sympathy;
“but I knew that Mrs. Carew was away and
I meant jiist to get a pound at the store.
She must ha’ been up real early to get it
made beforte she left,” she continued, aware
of dangerous ground, but like a criminal for
ever drawn to the spot where the deed was
committed. '*
“It’s all. right, Mrs. Tinder. I made it,”
he said shortly. “Good morning.”
“Oh, stop and have a nip,” said Tinder,
holding up, the bottle invitingly.
Bruce snook his head. “No, thanks,” he
said, and strode out, his spurs clinking.
He swung himself on to the little grey
mare, andsshe quickened her pace at the un-
accustomed pressure of knees and the still
sharper reminder of spurs in her flank.
“ ‘Dady help!’ ” lie repeated bitterly to
himself. “It’s what I am, and Bill Gowan
taking it on himself to tell the bar that I
was a man once!”
Reaching home he flung the reins over the
gate-post,'picked up the empty mailbag that
hung there,' and began to walk towards the
house. Then he remembered orders, which
were that‘horses —animals inconsiderate in
their habits —were to be hitched not to the
gate, but to-a post some twenty yards away.
He half halted, then muttered: “Damn! Do
your durnflest!” and walked into the house,
throwing the mailbag on to the floor, in spite
of the fact that a nail especially intended for
it lay within easy reach of liis arm.
“Lady help! Lady help!” The damned
rooster was crowing it!
He stood for a minute. What did he have
to do? Oh yes, wash the separator. Cold
water and then hot. Wash butter-pats and
basin. Place small jug of butter-milk in the
drip-safe, empty the rest in the pigs’ swill.
Of course, he ought to have washed the
separator before he had begun the churning.
He started a little guiltily as he noticed that
the butt of a cigarette he had placed on the
corner of the white scoured table had smould-
ered and made a slight brown mark. Helen
didn’t like his smoking in the dairy. He un-
clasped his pocket-knife and gently scraped
at the stain. Great heavens, what a row
she would kick up if she found the dairy in
a mess like this at ten in the morning, cigar-
ette and all! Well, anyhow, she wasn’t
here!
He filled a bucket at the tank and poured
it over the milky tins in the dish. “Take
twice as long to do now —ought to have left
them standing in water,” he muttered. He
gazed at them in disgust, then threw in a
handful of soda, and left them to soak.
Then “Here goes !” he said and mooched oft'.
At the door he almost stumbled over a
big pie-melon. A piece of paper, ingeniously
attached to it by two skewers, attracted his
attention. He bent down and read: “Cut in
pieces an inch square, weigh and cover with
sugar three-quarters to a pound of fruit.
Leave standing in pantry. Knives, weights
and dish all in kitchen. Be careful not to
leave any seeds in.—-Helen.”
“H’m,” he muttered—“nice little love-let-
BEYOND HER.
“I never kissed a man until I met your father. You couldn't tell
me that.”
“Yes, I could, mother ; but I couldn't keep such a straight face
while I said it.”
ter!” He tore it in halves and threw it on
the fire. “Sorry, but I suppose the wind
blew you away,” he muttered as he watched
it burn. Then he stooped, hoisted the melon
oil to his shoulder and strode down to the
pig-sty. He crashed it in, and it burst into
little pieces. With a grunt out came an old
sow, followed by ten little ones and greedily
attacked the food. “And I hope the seeds
swell in your beastly insides and kill the lot
of you,” lie said, “and save me getting up at
dawn to salt your carcases.”
He wandered listlessly round by the horse-
yard, noticed that a rug had fallen to the
ground and —left it there! Feeling for a
pipe he remembered that it was in another
coat-pocket and slowly retraced his steps
towards the house.
Habit was so strong that he had unfastened
his boots before lie thought of it. Then he
kicked the neatly-placed slippers aside and
entered, if not with flags, at least with laces
flying.
In his tobacco cupboard he found a long-
forgotten cigar; forgotten because Helm
would not have them smoked in the house,
and he really only enjoyed a cigar after
dinner in the evening. He cut the end now
and lit it. A little piece of mud lay on the
hearthrug where it had fallen off his boot.
He regarded it with a gleam of satisfaction ;
then he sank back in an armchair and put
his feet up on the back of another. He puffed
away at liis cigar discontentedly.
“Lady-help! Lady-help! And he used to
he a man!”
Bill Gowan wasn’t worth thinking about,
or his opinions; but the others had accepted
it—and it was true. He was from everlast-
ing to everlasting on the end of a broom, or
scrubbing floors, polishing brass or pasting
up beastly bottles of jam !
Good God! How had he come to it? Of
course the war had put an end to polo, and
his heart, which had gone against his en-
listing, had stopped his football too. Still,
he hadn’t felt his heart for years. Helen still
fussed about it, but only if he wanted to
play tennis or cricket. It was never too
bad for him to sweep or scrub or put up new
shelves or paint the ceilings. He began to
suspect that his heart had been used as a
weapon against him. He’d get Dr. Harvey
to overhaul him again, and—and —he’d do
something! Umpire their footer matches
again. Go down to Sydney and get old
Fletcher to brush up his boxing. Whatever
happened, he’d cut this lady-help business.
He tossed his cigar butt into the empty
fireplace. Then he regarded it dubiously.
No! No good starting her off as soon as she
came in. He must just introduce the sub-
ject and talk it over quietly. It was just on
the cards she might come home to-niglit.
Someone in a car might offer her a lift.
He picked up
the cigar butt and
took it outside and
pressed it into a
garden bed. Then,
wandering in search
of food, he opened
the pantry door.
There would be a
great basin of cold
pudding. She told
everyone that lie
loved cold pudding.
He opened the safe
door. Yes, this was
his meal! Oh, yes,
he’d met this sort
of thing too often
not to know for
whom it was in-
tended. A slab of
Sunday’s red-jelly
leaning coyly
against a solid
monument of yes-
terday's cornflour
shape!
“A fid of jelly
and a gob of goo,”
he muttered. “Goo”
was an old school
name for cornflour
shape, and “fid”
and “gob” were two
words Helen par-
ticularly disliked.
“Perfectly good
words,” he mut-
tered. Walking
into the dining-
room he referred to
a tattered old copy
of Webster. “Fid : A
short, thick lump.”
“Gob : A poisonous
morsel.” There!
If that didn’t de-
scribe this lot!
He’d make her look
up W ebster and
hold the plate un-
der her nose while
he dilated upon the
singular applica-
bility of the words
to the meal she had
left for him.
In anticipating his victory he soothed a
little of his annoyance. Then he began again.
Silly to object to decent old English words —
nothing in Webster to say they were vulgar.
Helen had a dashed lot of that silly, arti-
ficial delicacy about her —waited until
after they were married to ask him to
say “serviette” instead of “dinner napkin.”
Bosh ! Good old English word ! Serviette !
Bah!
“ ‘Fid.’ ‘Gob.’ Jolly good English words.”
But he wasn’t going to eat them!
He shut the safe and walked into the
kitchen. On the table stood a tin of aspara-
gus. On top of it a tin-opener. Beside
it a silver dish.
“Good little woman,” his brain began. She
knew how he loved asparagus.
Then his eye fell on the silver dish.
“Oh no, not for me. More of these cursed
visitors.”
Almost in a fury he jambed the tin-
opener in and tore the lid off. He drained
the liquid, lifted a stalk out and began to
eat it. He moved about the room putting bread,
butter and plates on to the table, and tlien
lie sat down. He finished the asparagus
and went to make a cup of tea. ,
had boiled dry. so he refilled it and sat down
to wait. He threw in a handful of chips to
hurry things up, realising that ne as
thirsty. . . .
He was not allowed to enjoy a Pea 0 ®™
after-luncheon meditation tor long,
wretched conversation in the bar was too
recent and too deeply imprinted not
trude itself at the first opportunity.
Yes, they would know that he had heard—
the way he walked out without a word and
without his nip. Lord, if only he copld
get a nip now! Helen didn t like it mt .
house, but lie knew that there was some m
the medicine chest —she took a nip herself
sometimes, all bunged up with sugar and
lemon.
By this time he had found it. Plenty. He
took four fingers, and drained the glass, then
wandered out and lifted the kettle oft. He
would not bother with tea now. Hut the
sight of the boiling water reminded him ot
another domestic duty—there were still those
separator things to be washed. The question
was, should he get to work and then start
on the new lines to-morrow after a conversa-
tion with Helen, or leave the things as they
were and take a stand right now t
He straightened his shoulders and nerved
himself for a fight. If Helen really got
nasty he’d go to Cowloo. If that didn t
settle it he would go and see the wool sold m
Sydney—other men did these things. Any-
how, come rain or shine he’d drop this
blasted housework. Helen could let her little
tongue loose, she could raise Cain, but he
would see it out.
He stretched himself out on a hammock
on the verandah and fell asleep.
The sun was sinking when he awoke. He
sprang up. It must be five—the calves
should have been penned by four. You could
stake your life that they would be away on
the Crown Hill. He’d ride for them. Then
he remembered Nettie still standing patiently
by the gate.
“Poor old girl!” lie said tenderly as he
lifted off the bridle and watched her toss her
mane and trot gratefully down to the water-
tank. “Couldn’t ride her after leaving her
hitched up there all day.” He measured an
extra supply of oats out into her feed-bin
and set off on foot for the calves. It was
nearly six before he got them home and
penned. He threw some wheat to the fowls
and gathered a dozen eggs into liis hat.
As he neared the house he hurried. The
telephone was ringing madly.
It was Helen’s mother.
Helen? Coming home? By seven? Why
hadn’t they let him know sooner? What?
Been ringing all the afternoon? What?
What? Whof Bringing a parson? What
for? Oh, all right! No; he didn’t say any-
thing. Yes, ivhat did Helen say? Make up
a bed in the spare room? Oh, did she?
Best linen sheets in lowest drawer in spare
room? Oh, are they? Yes, yes, what else?
Put potatoes on to boil? Yes. And bring
half a dozen chops up from the meat-room!
Yes, I can hear, thank you. Set the table —
clean cloth. Yes, damn y0u.... I said thank
you. Yes, cold mutton in the safe. Aspara-
gus? Hell! Well, I said well? Sounds
funny? I’m not feeling funny. Silver dish?
Yes, I know all about the silver dish!
He banged the receiver on to the hook.
Bringing the parson home. That just
about settled things. No good having a row,
with that johnny in the house.
He opened the sitting-room door and began
to swing the curtains to and fro. No doubt
about it, cigar smoke did cling. He left the
doors all wide and went into the kitchen.
Thank God the water was boiling on tue
side of the stove! He would get to work at
once on those separator things. Then make
the parson’s bed—oh, hell! But he'd better
—and get these boots off in case he forgot.
And the front gate where Nettie had been
standing—he’d better do that before he
changed his boots.
He set the table; then he made .the spare-
room bed, arranging a tuck in the quilt
neatly, deftly as a woman might.
The thought of the asparagus smote him
to a standstill. Hope revived. There might
be another tin in the store.
There was. He arranged it as he had
found the first. Then he recollected that
orders were to open it and have it ready tor
tea. But first he took the empty tin and
buried it far away down the paddock.
He was feverishly endeavoring, with a
toothbrush and much paste, to remove from
his breath the tell-tale odors of whisky, cigar
and asparagus, and debating whether Helen
would recognise them individually or collec-
tively (he was most afraid of the asparagus)
when he heard the car. One last long gargle
of toothpasty water and he went out to meet
them.

MOTOR O/JL
For Better Lubrication
FOREMOST among the items contributing to the
economical and efficient running of your car is
Lubrication. Power, output, reliability and main-
tenance costs are all affected by this vital factor.
In every big achievement of speed, endurance and
reliability by car, motor-cycle, aeroplane or motor-boat,
“CASTROL” is almost invariably the lubricant
employed.
“CASTROL” is the oil which best withstands
extremes of heat and pressure. You may not subject
your oil to these extremes, but the same qualities which
make Wakefield “CASTROL” a necessity for racing
purposes on land or sea or in ths air make it essential for
best results for touring use.

The fleet of “Super-Sentinels” giv-
ing satisfactory service to Messrs.
Howard Smith, Limited. “Super-
Sentinels,” for Service and* Saving,
are the most economical and reliable
form of heavy transport.
“Super-Sentinel” Steam Waggons
Many Repeat Orders
Prove their Superiority.
*TpHE most satisfactory recommendation you could
have for a “Super-Sentinel” Steam Waggon would be
from a firm or municipality which finds by experience
that for heavy, speedy road haulage at Low Cost, this
is easily the finest form of transport. The most satisfac-
tory recommendation we could have is a repeat order.
When repeat orders are sent in by many well-known
users the proof is overwhelming.
The fuel cost of a “Super-Sentinel” is only |d. to £d. per
ton-mile. The “Super-Sentinel” is British-built for
Service, Economy and Efficiency—will give you more
years of satisfactory use than any other form of transport.
Its simplicity of operation, by steam, and the small
number of slow-moving parts, ensure its utter dependa-
bility and bring maintenance costs to a minimum. Let
us show you that a “Super-Sentinel will be a wise
investment for you. We 11 be pleased to supply full
information without obligation.

ECONOMY is not effected by the
number of pounds spent in the
purchase of a car, but in the number
of years of trouble-free service that
the car will give. There are Humber
cars on the road now that first saw the
light of day in 1904. Twenty-one
years of service like this makes the
purchase of a Humber an economical
proposition—a wise investment.
