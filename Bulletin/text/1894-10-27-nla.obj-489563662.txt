THE BULLETIN” BOOK EXCHANGE.
On receipt at The Bulletin Office, Sydney, of Postal Order, Postal Notes, or Stamps equal
to the price stated, books in the subjoined list will be forwarded to any Australasian address:
Mining* Books.
There are dozens and scores of mining hand-books, and not one that can be
wholly recommended. As a rule, practical men can’t write, and theorists don’t
know; and the result is that books professedly simple are generally so technical as
to be hopelessly beyond the grasp of the average miner, or even of the instructed
one. Then, again, the treatises extant are mostly published in America and Eng-
land, and deal with American and English conditions. Rudimentary principles, of
course, are everywhere the same; but the Australian application of principles is, for
the most part, totally different in detail. The result is that every miner has to get
his knowledge by the painful old rule-o’-thumb process, falling into precisely the pit-
falls which have snared his predecessors, and winning his way to success, if he ever
reaches it, through difficulties and losses which previous experience should have
saved him from. The undermentioned books are defective from the Austra-
lian point of view, but all of them contain matter which can be turned to valu-
able account by a shrewd head. It often happens that one is puzzled as a prospector
or mine or battery manager for want of a little knowledge of how other people meet
their troubles; and much may be gained from the stored-up wrinkles of others,
however imperfectly set forth.
A PRACTICAL GUIDE TO PROSPECTORS, EXPLORERS, AND MINERS,
by C. W. Moore. Cloth, 15s. 9d. •
This book is especially full and valuable in the matter of blowpipe analysis, and
many colored illustrations are added.

An overseer’s handbook.
“THE PROSPECTOR’S FIELD-BOOK,” by F. S. Osborne. Cloth, Bs. 9d.

“THE HYDRAULIC GOLD-MINER’S MANUAL,” by T. S. G. Kirkpatrick.
Cloth, 6s. 3d. , „
Not at all bad, with many illustrations ; and specially successful because it
confines itself definitely to one'branch of the subject.
“A MANUAL OF MINING,” by M. C. Helsung. Cloth, 21s.
This is a comprehensive American treatise on engines and gear, mine-develop-
ment and working, suitable for managers who want to study up the question
thoroughly.
“THE MINER’S POCKET-BOOK,” by C. G. Lock. Leather, 13s.
“THE MINER’S HANDBOOK,” by John Milne. Cloth, 7s. 9d.

“PROSE FANCIES,” by Richard Le Gallienne. Cloth, 6s. 6d.
A recent book of idyllic essays, throwing the glamour of imagination over the
desert of commonplace, and transmuting lead to .gold by the alchemy of exquisite
prose. “ A Borrowed Sovereign ” should be read at least six times.

ing to bear effectively on subjects of the day. He is invariably clear and suggestive,
and his tendencies make always for progress.

Answers to Correspondents —H.C.: Graham’s “Socialism” (posted, ss. 6d.) is the
best and most impartial book. Going by easy stages you might work up to it with
(pro) Bellamy’s “ Looking Backward ” (Is. 3d.) and [con) Richter’s “ Pictures of the
Socialistic Future ” (Is. 3d.); then [pro) the “Fabian Essays"” (Is. 3d.) and (tow) “ A
Plea for Liberty” (2s. 3d.). Schaffle’s “ Quintessence of Socialism ” (2s. 9d.) is good and
compact J.M.I). : Meiklejohn’s “Book of the English Languase ” (Is. 3d.) is the
handiest introduction to scientific etymology.

Among China’s many difficulties it has
been discovered that a lot of the brass fittings
belonging to the big guns of her fleet have been
pawned or sold to marine stores by various
officers. Before two of the vessels engaged in the
last naval battle could put to sea a whole quantity
of munitions had to be hunted out of various
adjacent three-ball establishments. Even such
things as shells and steam pumps were dis-
covered to be at the local uncle’s. This ought to
takej;he prize in the matter of corruption.
Another quotation from Carey as a reply
to Mark M‘Dermot, who asks, ‘‘What benefit
would a Protective tariff be to the Australian
selector?” By bringing population and his
market near it would enable him to grow turnips,
potatoes, green crops, ‘‘of which the earth pro-
duces tons, instead of wheat which it furnishes in
bushels,” but which from its less bulk can now be
exported to the other end of the world. It would
enable him to convert his grass, now worthless,
into milk, butter and cheese for immediate con-
sumption. It would find him a ready, a steady,
and a larger market without the intervention of
the army of middlemen wiionow prey on him and
the consumer of his produce.

Sheep-station in Maoriland, in 1865.
Highland manager, engaged in distilling whisky
from native cabbage-tree roots. Result, two
bottles of doubtful-looking potheen. This being
the first brew, the brewer, not too sure of the
power of the decoction, puts it by till New Year’s
night, and even then is afraid to sample it.
Two swaggers appear on the scene. A happy
thought strikes Donald ; “I’ll gie them a bottle
o’ my whusky, and see how it affects them."
Carries out his good intentions, and retires. Next
morning makes enquiries, and learns that the
swaggers are alive, and apparently well. “Here
goes then ” —uncorks the remaining bottle —“ if it
will no kill two swaggers, it will no kill me.”
How is that for Scotch caution ?-

Co.’s coach ready to start. Heavy swell: “Haw,

Groom: “Yes, sir.” H.S.: “Are you suah?”
Groom: “ Yes, sir.” H.S.: “Now, groom, you
may bring out my rug and handbag. Hurry up,
and don’t keep me waiting.” Groom has a short
and whispered consultation with driver, on seat.
H.S. (to driver): “ What did that man ask you ?”
Driver: “He asked me, sir, who you were, sir,
and I told him, sir, you are the gentleman who
bought Victoria, sir, and that you are just haring
a look at New South Wales, sir.”
When Talmage was in Melbourne he
quoted Edison to the effect that the existence of
an intelligent Creator can almost be proved by
chemistry. By the end of the <-v itury, the intel-
ligent Creator—one almost doubts the intelligence
when contemplating some of His drummers of the
Talmage type—will probably be reduced by chemi-
cal analysis to His constituent elements. The
next step will be to bottle Him up in phials. The
parsons will then turn chemists and retail the
Almighty under a registered brand with the adver-
tised caution to the public:—“Ask for the
Anglican (or Presbyterian, or Wesleyan, or
Calithumpian) Almighty, and see that you get
Him. None other genuine.” We are getting on
famously. The closing years of the last century
were supposed to have produced some pretty
capable blasphemers, but they would be looked
upon as feeble creatures in these days.
Dear Bulletin —Some time ago a par-
ticularly morose “ hatter ” went to a N. Territory
pub. and bought sundry bottles of grog, with
which he departed to his camp near by to have a
solitary orgy. An hour or two later some men
standing on the pub. verandah fancied they smelt
burning flesh, and went over to the camp to
investigate. It was the hatter. He was lying
drunk across a burning log on his face, alive, but
with his chest and stomach roasted to a crisp.
The local trooper —who acts as a court of appeal
in all kinds of bush horrors—was sent for, and
presently arrived with his assistant black tracker.
There was no doctor available, and no magistrate
or other authority. So, when the trooper had
considered the blackened object writhing and
feebly crawling on the grass, he sent his aboriginal
to wet a sack in the river, and with it he humanely
smothered the dreadful apparition, and put it out
of its misery. It was undoubtedly the wisest and
best thing to do under the circumstances, but as j
the matter might have required a lot of explana-
tion before the authorities, the trooper sagaciously
dispensed with an inquest, and instructed his
nigger to bury the dead hatter in the sand. He
was buried accordingly, and there, so far as I
know, the matter dropped. No one knew any-
thing about the deceased; he was one of the
innumerable multitude named Bill whose names
and identity have been lost in the Never Never.
So, if anyone wants to find a missing relative in
these parts, there is a smothered cinder, with a
bag round its head, still waiting to be claimed on
a northern sand-plain,—Yours, &c., H.S.R.
London Times, weekly edition, July 20i
1894, on the evolution of Anti-Semitism :
Our Berlin correspondent tells us that the logical evolu-
tion of Anti-Semitism is progressing with startling
rapidity. First we had Dr. Stocker’s Christian Anti-
Semitism directed against the Jew's w>ho still follow the
Mosaic law. Then came racial Anti-Semitism, which
based its operations on ethnical as distinguished from
religious antipathy. Now we have social Anti-Semitism,
which includes in a common reprobation with Jews by
creed or by descent all capitalists as being Jews by
analogy, and it cannot be denied that this latest form of
Anti-Semitism is rapidly supplanting the older forms,
and appeals much more forcibly to the ear of the masses.
In another direction also the most recent developments
of Anti-Semitism such an orthodox divine
as Dr. Stocker always claims to be food for very
unpalatable reflection. The Bible is, it seems, to be
placed on the Anti-Semitic Index as being permeated
with Jewish falsehoods, and Ahlwardt, in a pamphlet he
has Just published as the outcome of his meditations in
prison, declares that Christ’s genealogy must have been
forged by the Jews, as it is impossible to believe that the
Founder of Christianity or any of His disciples, except
Judas Iscariot, can have sprung from the accursed race.
Yet it is a party fed on such insanities which, in one of
the most intelligent and highly-educated countries in the
world, thrives and prospers more than any other, not so
much amongst the lowest classes as amongst the lower
middle classes of the population, and especially of the
urban population, and, what is even more strange, still
finds countenance and encouragement from the represen-
tatives of extreme Conservatism.
The late Dean of Melbourne used to make
ins sermons esactly half-an-hour long, and, when
preaching, always kept his watch before him so
that his “ Amen ! ’* would fall on the exact tick.
Nervous sufferers will find it worth their
while' to peruse Herr Rassmussen’s advt. on page

deceased, originally started business by taking
over the printing-ogjoe of an individual who
levanted under peculiar circumstances. He had
got into trouble and devised original methods of
keeping his head above water. He had a peculiar-
looking vehicle with a stylish horse which was
well-known about town; this, the day before he
bolted, he sold to several friends for cash, but
persuaded each buyer to let him have the use of it
for a day or two. Amongst the rest he sold it to a
| priest, and when going away delivered it to his
reverence, who successfully held it against all
claimants. On the Saturday he left he changed
his cheques in several places, pleading that it was
after bank hours. Amongst his largest creditors
was a solicitor to whom he was indebted over
,£5OO. The attorney was on board the steamer
seeing a friend off when he encountered the
printer in travelling-cap and rugs. “Hello, off
for a trip?” jestingly. “Oh, no; come to
see a friend off; ” and in view of the land-
shark the diddler got into a waterman’s boat,
the man of law getting over the other side into
i the steam-tender. The smart printer immediately
reboarded the steamer and got away for ever.

The Coming Australian.
Receding tourists, like receding tides, leave
their jetsam upon our shores. Sometimes it
is a mere tangle of weed and scum ; some-
times a shell murmuring lessons learned in
the deep ocean of truth. The flippant im-
pressions of Anthony Trollope and Max
O’Rell, writing chiefly to amuse, are the
merest spume and froth of thought. The
balanced judgment of Froude and the keen
criticism of Francis Adams may be dis-
puted, but must be respected. Of all our
censors, Adams has incomparably the clearest
vision and the surest touch. Miss Shaw is
an admirable chronicler and a worthless
commentator. Her grasp of facts and details
is wonderfully strong, of opinions and prin-
ciples invariably weak. Adams added splen-
did analysis to splendid synthesis ; and even
Marcus Clarke, with as many years spent
in Australia as Adams spent months, has left
us no such body of suggestive thought upon
ourselves and our future as Adams left in
his brilliant Fortnightly essays.
• • »
It is curious and instructive to compare
the impressions of the writers who have
wandered through Australia and sought to
discern the feeble glimmerings of national
tendencies. Trollope, in 1871, thought the
Australian-born laborer superior to the immi-
grant. In other classes, he found the young
native listless, unenergetic, vain, and boast-
ful, coming too quickly to a weak maturity.
“He rarely runs into bad vices. He does
not drink, gamble, or go utterly to the dogs.”
But, if he does nob fall, he cannot rise, and
he is too content in mediocrity. Thirteen
years later came Froude, learned, thought-
ful, severe, aiming at truth ; but always in
leading-strings, fixed in preconceptions, and
seeing only what he was shown. Still, he
saw much, and his intellect enabled him to
sift the real from the merely plausible, the
vital from the unimportant. It is strange,
considering the difference in the two men,
how Froude’s judgment repeats Trollope’s,
whilst enlarging upon it :
Sydney colonists have no severe intellectual interests.
They are courteous and polite . . energetic . . hut
only to conquer the enemies of material comfort, that
their own lives may be bright and pleasant. . . There
were no persons that I met with who showed much
concern about the deeper spiritual problems in the resolu-
tion of which alone man’s life rises into greatness. . .
They have no national concerns and risks. . . They
will have good lawyers among them, good doctors, good
men of science, engineers, merchants, manufacturers, as
the Romans had in the decline of the Empire. But of
the heroic type of man, of whom poets will sing and
after ages be anxious to read, there will not be so many,
when the generation is gone which was bred and horn in
the old world. . . The rising Australians are “promis-
ing young men.” It they mean to be more they must
either be independent or must be citizens of Oceana.
This, though spoken directly of Sydney
residents, has reference to the whole race of
Australians, and particularly to the natives
as Froude saw them. So also has this,
spoken of the Victorians :
With so fair a climate and with life so easy, the Vic-
torians cannot be sad, and it is pleasant to see I people
who know so well how to enjoy themselves. But m< n
and nations require in reserve a certain sternness, and if
anything truly great is ever to come out of them, this
lesson will in time be hammered into them.
The gist of Froude’s criticism is thus that
life is too easy with us, that we lack the
stimulus to be strong, and that our material
prosperity tends to spiritual barrenness.
• * •
Compare Max O’Rell, up to date :
Of all the members of the great Anglo-Saxon family I
think the Australian is destined to become the most easy-
going, the most sociable, and, perhaps, the most cheerful.
. . . You will not find in the Australian that dogged,
obstinate perseverance, that bull-dog tenacity which has
helped the English Io do so many great things, and which
still puts the Scotchman beyond competition in every
enterprise which calls for privations, hard work and in-
domitable tenacity. . . . The Australian has quite a
passion for amusement. There is no country in the world
whose people flock in such numbers to theatres, concerts,
exhibitions, all places of recreation ; there are no people
who take so many holidays, or enter with so much keen-
ness into all national sports ; there is no society that
dines and dances quite so much as Australasian society.
Is there not a striking similarity in the
thought which naturally rises to the lips of
these three surveyors of Australian character,
separated from each other by a decade of
time, yet singularly unanimous in verdict ?
Now take Adams, who brought a more open
mind to utilise greater opportunities of
observation ; though his judgment also was
warped by sickness and fettered by pre-
judice :
The native Australians have too often the self-sufficiency
that is b gotten on self-confidence by ignorance. Lean
and high-strung, with the alternations of languor and
activity which the terrible changefulness of their climate
gives them, they wear themselves out in all they do, mis-
taking the exercise of nervous energy for pleasure. They
have in their underside the taint of cruelly. . . More
and more the characteristics of a careless, pleasure-
loving race are developed as secularly-educated Young
Australia, (he true religious Gallic, gets his way. . . .
The average temper of Australians more and more
shows itself either indifferent or hostile to the outer
world. . . . The heathenism of the bush is intense.
Everyone is at heart a pessimist.
Adams draws a broad line of demarcation
between the residents of the coastal belt and
those of the interior plateau, and looks to
the latter for our best results. “ Frankly,”
he says, “ I find not only all that is genuinely
characteristic in Australia and the Austra-
lians springing from this heart of the laud,
but, also, all that is noblest, kindliest and
best.”
Marcus Clarke, whose famous judgment
of the coming Australian would seem best of
all were the dogma a little less doubtful and
the wit a little less sparkling, divides the
Australia of the future into temperate and
tropical, ruled respectively by a republic and
an aristocracy (being copied in this by Miss
Shaw) :
The Australians will be a fretful, clever, perverse, irrit-
able race . . . selfish, self-reliant, prone to wander,
caring little for home ties . . . freed from the highest
burden of intellectual development (genius). . . . The
Australasian will be a square-headed masterful man, with
full temples, plenty of beard, a keen eye, a stern and yet
sensual mouth. His teeth will be hard, and his lungs
good. He will suffer from liver disease, and become
prematurely bald : average duration of life in the un-
married, fifty-nine; in the married, sixty-nine and a
decimal. ... In another hundred years the average
Australasian will be a tall, coarse, strong-jawed, greedy,
pushing, talented man, excelling in swimming and horse-
manship. His religion will be a form of Presbyterianism;
his national policy a democracy tempered by the rate of
exchange. His wife will be a thin, narrow woman, very
fond of dress and idleness, caring little for her children,
but without sufficient brain-power to sin with zest. In
five hundred years, unless recruited from foreign nations,
the breed will be wholly extinct; but in that five hundred
years it will have changed the face of nature, and swal-
lowed up all our contemporary civilisation.
The differences, as well as the harmonies, of
these critical dicta give scope for endless
debate, with Time as sole qualified arbiter.
But speculation, in spite of uncertainty, will
have always its value. It is in our power by
politic government to alter many of the con-
ditions of national life, and so to weaken, if
we cannot withstand, the currents of de-
terioration in our national character. If
observers and thinkers can but determine
the nature and force of those currents, and
statesmen can erect a barrier to their influ-
ence, the Republic of Australia will long
live to amuse its children with the prophecy,
of Marcus Clarke.
Sydney Spookery.
The Confidence Man lives and thrives in civil-
ised communities, not because he towers
intellectually above his fellows, but because
his fellows, when spurred by a greed responsive
to that which actuates him, are as gullible as
week-old puppies, and, when amused with a
rolling reel the guiding-string of which is
unseen, are as inquisitive as young kittens.
Science, like sociality, has its Confidence Men.
Don goggles, murmur meaningless abracadabras,
cultivate a perpendicular frown on the brow,
vent polysyllables and gibberish, mumble of
marvels, mystify with manipulation, and you
may write your own diploma as a professor, and
the certificate will be unhesitatingly accepted
by the average male or female who yearns to be
thought striding in the van of progress
without taking the trouble to learn any goose-
step. And just as the ordinary Confidence Man
of commerce is not “ the only son of a nobleman
who lias just come into a large fortune and is
travelling around the world doing good by
giving it away in bagfuls to deserving people,”
so the average Confidence Man of science is not
a scientist even of the lowest grade. Both
sets of Confidence Men may be relied upon as
frauds, with the exception that the Confidence
Man of science is sometimes an honest dupe as
well as an unconscious duper, and may be
classed among the hopeless cranks.
# * *
Hypnotism and telepathy have some tendril-
roots buried remotely in animal magnetism,
but their Confidence Men—the showmen who
travel on the game—only by accident ever
sound real emotional chords, and, when they
do so, are more surprised than either the victim
or the spectators. Clairvoyance and prophecy
are in reality the subtle finished reasoning of
the finer processes of ke<jji and unerring intel-
lect ; the Confidence Tricks of clairvoyance,
divining, &c., are the vulgar pretences of the
quack uncouthly factored to match the lethargic
ignorance of the dupes. As the victim of an
ordinary Confidence Man of commerce deserves
no sympathy, mainly because he is betrayed
into stupidity by his own greed and self-
conceit, so the dupes of the Confidence Man of
science merit all their hideous befoolery. Yet.
if nineteenth-century law holds that it is its
duty to protest the simple “mug” from
“ sharps” against whom he cannot protect him-
self, it should also assign to itself the protec-
tion of the smatterer against the Confidence
Man of science. The law has not yet learned
logic. The Confidence Man of commerce
reaches gaol; the Confidence Man of science
founds a sect, or a school of philosophy, and
earns honorable mention from his fellows.
* * •
The human mind is a balloon charged with
volatility capable of infinite expansion. Its
fabric is ordinarily of such poor stuff that its
first, constant, and last necessity is a safety-
valve. Lose the string of the safety-valve, and
burst goes the balloon. The volatility is called
imagination; when the balloon bursts, it is
styled hallucination. The safety-valve is
materialism. The average mind is so cramped,
and the average imagination, when skilfully
heated, is so elastic, that the average man can
no more help rushing after chimeras and exult-
ing in the unrestraint .of impossible miracles
than he can help sneezing when his nostrils are
pungently titillated. Ami because man knows
this of himself and of his fellows, and because
life is chiefly a wild, hard, hungry battle of
grabbing and keeping, the Confidence Men of
science abound in the land.
* * *
Sydney has had an epidemic of “ a contagious
mental disease called Spiritualism.” The im-
mortal sponsor for the Marble Man of Cow
Flat, a medical gentleman of otherwise high
repute, has advertised it with all the
honorary zeal of a poetic, artistic and ardent
temperament. He has essayed researches into
occult forces in “ the strict spirit of scientific
enquiry,” according to the best of his belief
and the worst of his faith. It is true that the
medico declares that he is not a Spiritualist,
and parades a vague theory about sub-conscious
forces, and the self-aggregation of mysterious
invisibilities from living human bodies, and
their formativeness to the sense of vision in a
kindly condition of light—the gloaming, for
choice ; or the subdued glow of muffled gas
lined with red curtains, or something
equally chaste. But the learned gentle-
man deceives himself. In his esoteric heart
he grips the creed of Spiritualism as a feeble
saint who doesn’t hanker much after Paradise,
but only rather fears Sheol, grips at Christian
salvation. And the Confidence Men were not
long in discovering his predilection for the fan-
tastic gospel—which is certainly no gospel in
the true sense of “ glad tidings,” since under it
a man runs the risk of marrying his mother-in-
law for eternity. In the flood-tide of the
doctor’s investigations arrived Annie Besant,
pinnacled on an idolatry of lecturing fame,
armed with a brand - new (to Australians)
religion and a fascinating philosophy, and brim-
ful of yearning to prospect for Truth on Alpine
crests as well as in well-bottoms. With living
spooks of her own, and with weird messages
from dead friends arriving at intervals by tele-
patho-psychical mails, Mrs. Besant was able to
swallow three spiritualistically-raised ghosts at
one draught. And a Sydney paper was found
with greenness and business greed enough to
boom the whole matter seriously.
The pretensions of the Spiritualistic Circle
were of some magnitude. A lady, who seems
to have claimed only the rank of an ama:
teur disciple, while she displayed all the creden-
tials of a professional wonder-worker, was
presented before the public as that rate
Spiritualistic acquisition, a Materialising
Medium. It was alleged that she could not*
only coax the spooks to sit at a table
—the angels in Heaven probably drumstick
tables as accompaniments to harp-drill—to
write messages, to send her into trances (like
another lady at present under the notice of the
Sydney criminal courts), to croon ditties, &c.,
but could actually make them visible in form
until you could photograph them, or feed them
with chocolate-creams. Trumpery tricks, sir h
as “ ringing ” a busted tambourine on a living
arm while the hand was held down (and, in
the deflowered name of science called “ the
passing of matter through matter !”), were not
disdained, but the visible gliding ghott was the
thing, and hundreds and thousands of Syd-
neyites read, wondered—rand believed. And it
was just at this supreme stage, after the
Marble-man-from-Cow-Flat authenticator had
decided to worry a “ Royal ” Society to investi-
gate spookery, that some of the newly-made
believer s had their faith hosed with catastrophe.
A wicked and doubting spectator suddenly
grabbed at the “ spirit-form ” and found that
ho had hold of—the medium ! The, great
materialising priestess ! The trance - laid
medium who was supposed all this time to he
lounging perdu in a cabinet, behind a curtain !
The medium with a black mask on her face and
white muslin on her shoulders
The fact is that human life is full of excep-
tional experiences, for which the human mind
cannot fully account. The Marble Man doctor
can “ will ” a doQr open or shut, without touch-
ing it; but has just enough saving sense to
deny believing'in Spiritualism. Just so. What
has Spiritualism to do with that ? Only just as
much as finding a freckled toad under a cab-
bage leaf has to do with the question of the
binomial theorem. But when the doctor after-
wards asserts that he still believes in the
genuineness of the “materialisations” thusraised
and grabbed, the former prescription should be
enlarged. Somebody should brain bim at once
as a scornful stigma on the Irish.intellect. Let
the reader believe nothing about any spook
that won’t satisfy the' evidence of all the com-
bined senses. Everything else is hallucination,
and hallucination is of the harvest of disease.
In the meantime, let the dead spooks bury their
dead. .

Perhaps the most important of recent contri-
butions to the Minimum Wage Question Ims
been made by a conference of Melt), munici-
palities, callsd by Mayor Jordan, of Essendon.
The following is the schedule approved :
MINIMUM WAGE—BIGHT HOURS DAY.

Unfortunately, this schedule is not binding on
all, though many councils will adopt it.
Prahran will stand out, but perhaps not after
its next election. Vic. Public Works Dept,
should, step in and back up Essendon and
the Progressives in this mutter, N.S. Wales
Public Works Dept, having show n the example.
The stock cry against the minimum wage is
that it will shut out the old ami infirm. People
who never gave a penny in decent charity are
suddenly alive to the interests of the old and
inlirm. If these were the only objectors it
might not matter, but men in the ranks of the
workers are often found with the same cry in
their mouths. After all, how many of these
“ infirm ” ones are there ? There are no statis-
tics of the “infirmity” meant in this connec-
tion. “Infirmity” as used by statisticians
means inability to follow any kind of work.
The ages of the people, however, perhaps a (lord
a clue. We have added up, in sections, Hay-
ter’s figures for the Victorian 1891 census, and
give the results here :
Ages 16-19 (males) .. .. .. .. 45,886
~ 20-60 301,009
~ 61-V0 „ .'. „ .. .. 28,959
: „ 71-80 „ .. .. .. ■ 9,080
If we regard the 20-60 men as the able-bodied
of the community, and the 61-70 men as infirm,
we get a proportion of more than 10 sound men
to one unsound. The 16-19 men form a reserve-
fund calculated to more than repair any defi-
ciencies in the 20-60 group. On the other
hand, the 71-80 men may be fairly reckoned to
be out of manual labor altogether. Further,
we wrong the sexagenarians by classing them as
tainted all round. One in four of these old
boys offering for manual labor can his
might on the body of the unbeliever. If, in
addition to this, we reckon the tendency of
old men to withdraw altogether from manual
labor, we shall probably find that not
more than one in 25 who offers for manual
labor,, can be classed as “ old or infirm.”
The cry that goes up against the minimum
wage on behalf of 4 per cent, of the laborers is
therefore either mistaken or hypocritical. It
is charitable to care for the unfortunate, but to
involve a whole community in the misfortunes
of the unfortunate is a crime. Further than
this, the logical minimum wage, such as ap-
proved by Melb. municipal conference, recog-
nises the necessity for a piecework rate, where
practicable, and in stonebreaking the minimum
rate is fixed under which the able and the
partially-disabled can work without injustice.
It will be an easy matter for any municipality
to keep stonebreaking entirely under its own
control, so that the old and infirm shall have a
monopoly of that branch of usefulness. The
old and infirm argument against the minimum-
wage therefore breaks down.

Purves v. O’Hara: A Summing-Up.
Editor Bulletin, —To fairly apportion ihe
blame attributable to each of the combatants in
the recent unseemly fistic encounter between
Dr. O’Hara and Mr. Purves, Q.C., in Collins-
street, Melbourne, is somewhat difficult.'There
seems to have long been bad blood between the
pair, and if the .Q.C. nursed a private grudge
against the medico and misused his honorable
position as counsel by nl I cuing scurrilous com-
ment not sustained by the evidence, he stands
condemned of cowardly conduct. If the
medico, relying on his superior strength and
boxing skill, attacked with hut little warning
an older and weaker man, he also has been
guilty of a cowardly action. Both offenders
have, besides, besmirched themselves by ..their
subsequent indiscreet attempts to excuse’their
conduct. “ Qiri s’excnse,” &c., is only too
applicable here ! From counsel’s statement to
the press interviewer it would seem that personal
feeling was at the bottom of the erratic course
pursued in his speech for the defence in the Db
Albu case. If he were properly instructed in the
matter, as he would lead the public to infer,


unsel signally failed in the duty of cross-
C °amining the witness to the end : it was
e , .q oU sly his own fault that he did not ascer-
+ in from Dr. O’Hara the nature of the opera-
tion in reference to which his subsequent re-
!arks constituted the immediate casus belli.
Having failed, however, to lay a safe founda-
. 0 f indubitable evidence for his attack,
unsel got no more than he deserved from the
fudge's scathing denunciation of the reprehen-
sible license of the summing-up speech. But,
liould not the medico have rested satisfied
with the authoritative judicial rebuke ?
Why, save for notoriety of a very cheap
sort ' pursue the matter further ? It is
true that the medico resorted to his lawyers,
who seem not to have been fully seized
of the facts of the case, or doubtless they would
have advised their client differently. Freedom
of speech on the part of the Bar is but im-
perfectly apprehended by the public. ■ No
counsel should be allowed, nor does the law
Hlow him, to abuse this sacred privilege. On
the contrary, the law expressly forbids it. Nor
can there be a shadow of doubt that counsel in
the case cited could have been cast in heavy
damages for slander. No advocate is licensed
to go beyond his brief and what is brought out
in evidence. If such were not the law, with
human nature as it is, English communities
would not present such an immunity from
personal assaults as they do in connection
with the legal business of the courts. But,
apart from this legal redress, the bragga-
docio of the medico, after the pitiful en-
counter which he had himself commenced, was
a fatal blunder in tactics sufficient to strip him
of all the public sympathy and pecuniary
solatium to which he might have been other-
wise entitled. Doubtless some unsuccessful
litigants will rejoice at the Q.C.’s discomfiture,
and a few weak patients may glory in the
manly prowess of the amateur heavy-weight.
But level-headed men will regard this breach
of the peace with an amused contempt.—
Barrister.
Among the Spirits.
To anybody with an illumined sense of the in-
wardness of outwardness and the inscruta-
bility of the incomprehensible, nothing could
be more satisfactory than Mrs. Mellon’s ex-
planation. Mrs. Mellon is a medium good
enough to exhibit to Sydney society several
properly-guaranteed and well-authenticated
spirits. There are the usual curtained cabinet,
lowered gas, singing in a circle, and so on—the
whole box of tricks, in fact; and then the
spirits come forward and make speeches, eat
chocolate-creams out of the hand, and prove to
Annie Besant (who was “much impressed”)
that Theosophy is all a flam. The other
night, however, a rude sceptic, who had basely
ingratiated himself with the medium by bring-
ing her flowers, made a grab at one of the
spirits and caught the medium —so he says—
with her shoes and stockings off, a mask on her
face, and white muslin round her shoulders.
These things he saw by the light of the gas, which
another wicked sceptic had turned up full. He
also says he saw’ a false beard and other spiri-
tualistic etceteras, but alleges that as soon as
lie let go the medium all the properties vanished
beneath her skirts. Anybody accustomed to
sceptics will see at once that this is the usual
tissue of falsehoods which the bad spirits who
are always with us delight in inventing. For,
hear Mrs. Mellon’s explanation
“I was quite normal up to this time. Mr. Henry [the
sceptic] grabbed the form by the arm. You understand
that part of my being was in this form, and the moment
he made the grab I fell off my chair to my knees. The
people in the room heard me fall, and thought I had
fainted. When I fell I seemed to shoot into the form,
and practically to atsorh if, the consequence being by
this time that Mr. Henry, instead of gripping the form,
had hold of my arm. I should explain that we know
these forms to be made up of atoms and particles from
the atmosphere, and from those in the circle, combined
with the ‘ nerve aura ’ and ‘ life essence ’ of the medium ;
and if anything interferes with the form, which is really
part of the medium, it must necessarily hurt the medium,
and will draw the medium into the form. That fact has
In en demonstrated over and over again, but never in my
own case until this particular instance occurred.
This is as clear as the tailings from a ten-head
battery. The medium and the spirit are quite
different until you grab the spirit, when they
become the same at once. More explanation
“Cissy” [the chocolate-cream spirit] explained that
there was a very inharmonious influence in the room on
Friday evening [when the sceptic grabbed], and that she
Hired what would happen ; but, thinking what might
occur, she and the others of “ the band ” considered that
they had better not entrance me at all on that occasion,
and therefore decided to draw most of the power from the
lower extremities. Hence the attenuation of my lower
hmbs, until they became almost like sticks. The conse-
quence of this was that my shoes and stockings fell off.
1 may say, also, that I was shaking all over.
No one can read this without seeing that
Spiritualism has been once more triumphantly
vindicated, and that scepticism continues to
wallow as usual in the mire of its own unbelief.
Ihe Bulletin accepts the explanation as per-
fectly satisfactory; and only ventures to sug-
gest that in future, in order not to give even a
bare footing to the enemy, all mediums should
wear patent elastic garters.
Concerning' Certain “Vested Interests”
Last week (100 tons of Yankee onions were
in Sydney last week !) a deputation of
New South Wales farmers waited on Premier
Beid and asked for the retention of the present
duties on agricultural produce—a request which
was promptly and emphatically rejected. This
gave Sydney Telegraph an opportunity to
U) ld forth upon the blessings of Foreign-trade
as follows
Vested, interests had sprung up under the tariff.”
I its protective incidence farmers are enabled, it
wnn t 0 a tetter price for their wheat than they
u have to accept, which is only another
him . sa - v ' n « that the rest of the community has to pay a
, “.er pr ee f° r its bread. The vested interest referred
is, therefore, represented by the privilege of putting
f ll ' hands in the pockets of every wage-earner in the
, 0,, .V- No one needs to-be told that this is an interest
J some value, i, u t (,( ie question is—How did it become
Usted 'in the few persons who now lay claim to it?
P | P eo l'le whose pockets have to stand the racket never
neubelately granted it to them.
Ibe weird humor of the situation lies in the
, a °t that bread, flour, and agricultural produce
general have never been so cheap in New
, uth Wales as under the brief Protectionist
regime, and the Telegraph itself has pointed
118 °ut over and over again, and announced it
as 8,11 evidence that Protection is a failure. The
Telegraph is always falling between two
stools. It keeps one writer who demonstrates by
figures that prices have gone down under Protec-
tion, and t hat it is, therefore, a bitter injustice to
the agriculturist. And it keeps another who
asserts vaguely that prices have gone up, and
that the bloated agriculturist is preying on the
community at large. The real state of the case,
as demonstrated by the irresistible evidence of
the market-reports, is that prices have fallen,
but that the agriculturist has benefited by
getting a reliable market instead of, as before,
having a good market for tvvo or three years,
and then being swamped and ruined for
another two or three years by cheap
imports from glutted markets abroad.
Meanwhile the Telegraph’s curse at the
farmer as a Protectionist cormorant who lives
on the vitals of his fellow-men fits in badly
with its former lamentations about the same
farmer as a man who was crushed by an
iniquitous tariff and was longing to throw off
the yoke which had been forged around his
miserable neck.
The Damp Judge.
Quite a number of New South Wales Judges
are reported, as usual, to have been “ moved”
when they made their little official oration over
the late nonagenarian Alfred Stephen, and
one of them, at all events, was “ overcome,”
and had to stop several times in the course of
his speech to wipe away the tear of sensibility
from his eye. The Bar, it is interesting to note,
was likewise moved to a considerable extent,
also as usual. A good many people will pr-o-
bably think it about time to protest against the
theatrical dampness of the legal profession on
such occasions as these. The people who were
so much moved were none of them, so far as
the community is aware, related to the ex-Chief
Justice, and men don’t weep in public, as a
rule, for a casual acquaintance. Moreover, the
legal profession is almost the only one which
weeps publicly for anyone, and as the legal
profession is no more tender-hearted than any
other profession, it is quite impossible to take
its tears in sober earnest. In all seriousness,
The Bulletin finds it hard to believe
that the legal functionaries who were
“ overcome ” at the death of Alfred Stephen
cared very much whether he was dead
or alive, except, perhaps, on the purely selfish
basis that his death reminded them unplea-
santly of their own mortality. And if it had
been Washington instead of Stephen, most of
them would have cared just as little. One
man rarely weeps for another man’s death
unless he occupies such a position that his weep
is sure to get into the papers. The court police-
man, and the gaoler, and the defendant, and
the barrister’s clerk who humps his master’s
papers, being ordinary individuals whose weep
isn’t mentioned in the papers, remain dry, as a
matter of course. If the sobbing was a genuine
emotion it would be no respecter of pe; sons,
and a tender-hearted policeman would be as
liable to break down over the memory of a dead
Judge as the justice on the bench. But he
never does. Weeping is the monopoly of the
bench and the senior bar, and the underling
looks on with a stolid %ye and is
emotionless.
Once Bit, Twice Swindled.
“The time is not now far distant at which it
will become necessary for one or two of the
Victorian banks, which reconstructed last year,
to ask their creditors to assent to a revision of
the terms of schemes of arrangement in one or
two important respects.” Thus the respectable
Argus paves the way for an ignominious crawl
into bankruptcy by the institutions which were
so “ high-standing ” and honorable IS months
ago. There is not a word about the Argus
statements of then and now. Reconstruction,
in most instances, was founded upon bank lies
and newspaper deceit, and, now that the lies
are crumbling and the deceit has shifted its
position, those malodorous receptacles for
cash are about to abase themselves.' The
Argus, an avowed stickler for the just
fulfilment of all obligations, has discovered
that promises to pay depositors within a given
number of years “ could mean nothing but the
liquidation and realisation of a large volume of
assets.” Consequently they were rash pro-
mises, which ought to be cancelled forthwith,
we are gravely told. In short, it was absurd to
pretend that the banks in question were not
hopelessly insolvent, only the pretence was
necessary for the sake of “ public confidence.”
When reconstruction set in, a good slice was
cut off the deposit liability. The banks did not
undertake to pay back to their depositors all that
they had deposited, so, seeing that the realisation
of assets ought to be an everlasting process in
banking business, there should have been a
chance for the scheme to work. Before the
concerns became “temporarily” embarrassed
they were liable to pay money as it fell due.
Less is expected of them now, but the time is
not far distant when they must plead guilty to
having reconstructed under false pretences.
When they officially confess their miserable
condition the time will have come, one imagines,
for taking an inventory of these assets that
can’t be realised for the general reason that
they yield no interest. The real value of the
stuff which is put forward as a guarantee of
full payment in the indefinite future must be
shown to creditors before they can believe it.
A busted butcher has to bare his assets to the
meeting—why shouldn’t a twice-failed bank do
likewise ? A State audit must come. It is
almost here now.
More About Land-Resumption.
What is apparently one of the worst land-
resumption jobs ever perpetrated at the cost of
the people of New South Wales has just come
to light in connection with the Ocean-street
(Sydney) tram-line. When that costly public
work was constructed, about three acres at
Rushcutters’ Bay were wanted for the erection
of engine-houses. Over two acres were obtained
gratis by taking a piece off a public park, and
for the remaining seven-eighths of an acre the
State paid to some person at present unknown
to this paper the sum of £13,000. This was
equal tonearly£ls,oooperacre, or (say) £lOO per
foot frontage. The land in question is situated
a full mile and a-half from Sydney, deep down
in a damp and stinking hollow, beside a huge
drain, in a reclaimed region which was mostly
occupied until recently by Chinamen’s gardens.
The present value of allotments in this un-
wholesome locality is probably not much above
.£l5 a foot; so the Treasury paid for the land
at least six times its fair market value. People
are now asking who sold the land, and what
politician—if any—was he related to ; and at
what price was the land valued for municipal
rating purposes ? Also, what does the
Reid Government propose to do to prevent
any more such iniquities ? It is no earthly
use for the Reid Government to expose the
jobs of the Dibbs regime, and the Dibbs
Government to expose the jobs of the Parkes
regime, and so on ad infinitum, when the
exposure of jobs that are past only helps to
draw public attention from the jobs that are
present. What the country wants is that the
Ministry should hurry up with the Land-Tax
Bill, by which every landowner will be com-
pelled to value his own property for taxation,
and then, when the State wants to resume—
either for Public Works purposes or because it
considers the property to be under-valued —he
will get what he himself declared to be a fair
price, and no more. Until this is done, the
land-resumption business will be a bottomless
pit for the public finances, as before.
Duties and Principles.
A satirical person calling himself “A Vic-
torian Liberal ” wrote, the other day, to Mel-
bourne Age asking information as to how
protectionists can possibly be Liberals in
Australia whilst Liberalism in England favors
Freetrade. The idea of a Freetrade Tory seems
absurd to this British-born dogmatist, inasmuch
as he calls himself a sound Radical, who wants
to abolish high Customs duties. The man who
cannot perceive a difference between manufac-
turing conditions in old Britain and young Vic-
toria, and who will not understand that Victoria
has adopted European and American mearns to
encourage local industries is, generally speak-
ing, an unteachable being. It is not w’orth
anyone’s while to work for his conversion.
Freetrade is his English political religion, and
he clings to that simple faith with the tenacity
of a Bible idolater, who believes that a whale
swallowed Jonah because that unnatural feat
is recorded in Holy Writ. But when “ A Vic-
torian Liberal ” enquires : “ Are we going to
become a prosperous member of a great Aus-
tralian federation or are we going to sink to the
level of the bankrupt States of Southern Europe
and South America ? ” he opens up a new ques-
tion without being aware of its importance.
The impecunious condition of Italy, Greece,
Spain and Portugal, for instance, is no more
chargeable to a protective tariff than the pros-
perity of France is absolutely to be attributed
to the same cause. France, with its huge
standing army, gets richer every year in
defiance of Cobden’s purely British principles.
Its wealth is more equally distributed than the
gold of the little island Freetrade workshop, or
the dollars of the great American protected
Republic, though both of those commercial
rivals have flourished even more than itself, on
paper. Wise land-laws account in a large
measure for the present condition of the French
people. Italy is collapsing under a less
burden of military and naval expenditure, be-
cause it isn’t France, or America, or Great
Britain, or Germany, and for many other
reasons that have nothing whatever to
do with import - duties. Italy is a very
young nation which entered into the
precious Triple Alliance before it had cut its
wisdom teeth. For the rest, bankrupt States
are the result of corrupt Government. To that
“Victorian Liberal” who asks whether his
adopted State is to sink to the financial level
of some other countries, The Bulletin replies
with a significant smile. If the biggest robbers
are always to enjoy Government protection, and
freetrade in fraud is to remain the law
for a privileged class, then Victoria will sink
as aforesaid, without a doubt. Honesty is the
policy that must be established down South
before a demoralised people can make a reaQ
recovery from the effects of their “boom.”
And, since financial roguery has been pretty
closely identified with Freetrade Fat Man, it
follows that purification must come from a
Protectionist Parliament if it is to come at all.
♦ —
Pitt Town (N.S.W.) co-operative labor settle-
ment (470 souls ; Government subsidy, ,£7OOO ;
cash result of one year’s labor, £5O ; collateral
result, “a beautiful, simple Arcadian exist-
ence ”) sent a deputation to the Minister-in-
charge the other day, and informed that
astounded functionary that 40 per cent, of its
breadwinners are “ incapables ; ” that the dairy
is “ a complete failure ; ” that the bees all flew
away -but one hive ; that they amuse them-
selves cutting firewood (which doesn’t pay), and
“ other people ” make .£5 or .£6 a week carting
it (which does pay); that the Board of
Control buys potatoes at .£3 a ton in
Sydney (paid with Government money)
and retails them on the settlement at
£4 a ton (paid with Government money);
and that they wanted representation on the
Board of Control. Then the Minister up and
added more facts about the “ Wilberforce
Labor Settlement,” which spends 10s. on butter
for every £1 spent on bread ; and the deputa-
tion commiserated the Minister, and the
Minister commiserated the deputation ; and the
interview closed. But the farce continues ;
and the knot of well-meaning persons with
large aspirations and" small intelligences also
continue to frolic round in the guise of little
tin gods dispensing Govt, largesse; and when
the settlement finally expires it will be because
the land was bad, or the management was bad,
or something else was bad ; and in three or
four years new prophets will arise to prove
that the way to settle people on the land is to
take all the shiftless people you cam muster
and spoon-feed them into absolute incapacity
to do a stroke for themselves without Govt.
[i.e, , level-headed and industrious taxpayers )
backing. Then we will start more “co-opera-
tive labor settlements.” Good old human
nature !
The Age, although it clings fondly to the
gallows, advocates a measure of prison-reform,
and favours the theories of Dr. Garth
Wilkinson, who founds his principles on
Swedenborg’s discipline of hell. The idea is
to assess every criminal act at a monetary value,
and set the sum against the name of the
prisoner as a debt he owes to the State, which
must be paid off before he is permitted to go at
large again. This means profitable work for
the prisoners, and competition in the open
market. The notion has points, but it would
work entirely in favour of the smart man. The
best workman would earn the amount of his
debt in perhaps two-thirds of the time that it
would take an inferior tradesman or laborer to
earn a similar amount, and yet, from a moral
point of view, the latter might be the better
man. Because one man can make a dozen pairs
of boots in a given time, and another only nine,
is no reason why the former should serve three
months’ less for burglary or manslaughter. By
the way, will the Age tell us on what principle
the price of deceased would be arrived at in a
case of manslaughter ? Would corporation-
laborers and capitalists be rated on the same
plane, or would there be addilions for Thrift?
When will newspapers abolish the “ respect-
able-looking mam ? ” This intensely original
expression is inspired by the clothes of the
person in the dock, and the accusation doesn’t
concern the clothes but the man himself. The
most villainous bank-embezzler who was ever
brought to justice is “respectable-looking”
because a bank-official must wear clothes of a
certain orthodox pattern ; and the most moral
and law-abiding corporation laborer who w'as
ever wrongly accused is not “respectable-look-
ing,” because the nature of his employment
forbids. So long as this abject reverence for
clothes continues, the only way to secure the
distribution of even-handed justice is to dress
all defendants alike, whether in tweed, or
moleskins, or in evening clothes and a glaring
boiled shirt; or else to undress every defendant
completely and try him “ mid nodings on.” Con-
sidering that the case refers wholly to the man
and not to the clothes, the latter device would
be the more logical, only a fully-clothed jury
would probably give a very poor show to an
undressed defendant. Possibly, if the jury were
also undressed things might be about even.
The story about Lord Rosebery and the
street-walkers who followed him home was, years
ago, told of Gladstone.
One result of Sydney printers’ strike pro-
mises to be the establishment of a co-operative
jobbing office, which will make another cut at the
business profits. Printing is an excellent trade
to which to apply co-operation. The one thing
needful is to get a brainy, honest, energetic
manager, and give him an absolutely free hand to
“sack”loafersand incompetents. Co-operators must
be as hard on themselves as a master would be
hard on them. Once they start a mutual bene-
volent asylum they may put the shutters up.
N. Queensland has experienced the coldest
and most protracted winter felt for the past £0
years. Despite the damage done by over-crop-
ping at Maryborough and Bundaberg, it is esti-
mated that the total production of sugar for this
season in Queensland will exceed 90,000 tons,
valued at well over a million. What with meat-
works going up all along the Northern coast, an
increased production in gold, and the rapid pro-
gress of the sugar-industry, it is fair to assume
that of all the provinces Queensland will be
“ first round the corner.”
The Behring diphtheria-cure, which con-
sists simply in inoculating one diphtheritic animal
with blood-serum from another made immune by
the injection of diphtheria-germs, has reduced the
mortality of patients at Paris children’s hospital
from 60 to 15 per cent. What is this in essence
but a return to the homoeopathic principle almost
universally decried by the medical profession,
while at the same time they applaud vaccination,
based on a similar principle? Here we have
smallpox germs used to cure smallpox, consump-
tion-germs to cure consumption, hydrophobia,
cholera and diphtheria germs set to fight (me
another, and Hahnemann consistently cursed all
the time !
James Anthony Froude, historian, theolo-
gian, biographer, and essayist—a fine example of
a c tntankerous man of letters—is dead at 76. In
an age of faith he would have made a heroic
churchman, and the Zeitgeist which robbed him of
his beliefs soured his temperament and crippled
his judgment. His sphere was literary polemics,
but his heterodoxy nearly always overshot the
mark. His blame is praise, and his praise is fatal.
His literary style is clear, brilliant, and mono-
tonous, wanting life and sympathy. But his
industry and acquirements made him always res-
pected, and much of his work will live long
after him. In his youth he was ordained to the
Church of England, and in mind and body he was
of the true clerical type—hard, fearless and ascetic.
In later life he relinquished his vows, but his vows
never relinquished him. He was a fine militant
figure, and in a fitter environment he would have
been a finer church-militant figure. He fought all
his life, and only leaves the ring at the call of
“ Time!” to fight, if he gets the chance, all through
eternity.
Sargood Softgoods, back again in his old
character of Minister of Defence, is making Vic-
toria as warlike as before. Sargood spells gun-
powder and imperialism and wild alarums. Blood-
thirsty intelligence from Europe sends a thrill
through the department when Sargood occupies
the chair, and the nostrils of the commanding
officers dilate at the prospect of immediate in-
vasions by foreign powers. A few days ago
France was supposed to be calling on Sargood’s
adopted country to draw and defend itself, so the
valiant importer of socks and garters telephoned
to headquarters that there wasn’t another moment
to lose. A couple of Sin. guns were just then

When the Melbourne reconstructed banks reduce
their interest on deposits to 3 per cent., what will be the
sulphurous language of those cute individuals who bought
deposit-receipts at 16s. or so? And how will the welkin
ring with their wild cry of “ Where do we come in?” It
is an awful thing to be a cute individual these times.
* * * •
The three worst banks in Australia, according to
public opinion as evidenced by the local share reports, are
the " three O.’s.” There is no market whatever for the
ordinary shares of any one of them. The preference
shares of the City of Melbourne are also unquotable, and
those of the Colonial and Commercial of Australia sell at
about ss. in the £ on their nominal value.
* • * *
A.J.S. Bank shares (£6 15s. paid up), which
sold a tew weeks ago at £2, have been traded off lately at
265., and have now no buyers above 245. Almost all bank
shares have dropped more or less within the past month,
probably by way of another ironical comment on the
“ revival of confidence.” Even the Union, Commercial
of Sydney and New South Wales are moving downward.
• * • «
The Melbourne papers have, within the last
week, suddenly grown loud and brazen and wildly
jnsistant in their demands for a reduction in the rate of
interest payable on reconswindled bank-deposits. The
Age, in particular, calls aloud daily for a reduction from
4J to 3 per cent., and the Argus, which favoured 3£ at
first, is fast coming round to the same view. Neither
paper makes any allusion to the obvious fact that the pro-
posed reduction means a glaring breach of faith with the
depositors, and is partly bankruptcy and partly repudia-
tion. The one point which is kept steadily in view is
that several—probably a good many—of the banks which
were born again must either get a reduction or burst up
for good and all. The situation has long been going
steadily from bad to worse. The ordinary shares of the
Commercial of Australia, City of Melbourne, Colonial, and
even the Victoria, are, to all appearance, unsaleable —
in some oases, the buyer might even get a hand-
some price for taking over the liability ; and the
National is the only one of the Melbourne group whose
ordinary stock is a regularly marketable commodity.
And even its shares sell at over 80 per cent, discount.
Preference shares in the Commercial and Colonial are
offering at a quarter of their paid-up value, and those of
the City of Melb. s°em to have wholly vanished from the
quotations. The last balance-sheets of the Commercial
rndCity show that the profits have dropped almost to
nothing, and with the continuous fall in interest rates it
almost inevitably follows that the next ones will show a
serious loss. Some other balance-sheets, which are about
dne, are expected to pan out in an equally solemn
fashion. The choice between a partial and amicable
repudiation and a i extensive bursting-up sticks out more
conspicuously every day. But what a satire it all is on
the vaunted “restoration of confidence” of last year,
and the fulsome panegyrics which were expended on
Gyles Turner’s great reconstruction device 1
If there is to be another reconstruction, it should
be preceded this time by an independent audit. Two
years ago the directorates of the various fallen institution*
were still reporting regularly the magnificent prosperity
of their respective banks. Eighteen months ago they
reported that the only thing wanted to make (hem per-
manently sound was to refix their deposits at 4J per cent.
Now the same crowd want to meet their creditors, and
announce that a 3 per cent, reconstruction is the one
essential and atier that all will be well. The Bulletin
believes that all the hanks—save, perhaps, one which
seems too far gone for saving —would get through on a
3 p»r cent, basis, under decent management, but no body
of depositors should take any board’s assurance to that
eff ct, or to any other effect, without corroborative evi-
dence. And The Bulletin also believes that only six
reconstructed hanks in all Australia have any reasonable
ohance to survive under the present arrangement.
* » • *
In its issue of 29th September, The Bulletin
drew attention to the following figures showing the
annual income fronj the invested funds of the big life
insurance offices of Australasia, and the amount of interest
and rent outstanding at the date of last balance-sheet:—
Interest and Ditto, Out-
Rents standing and
1893. Accrued.
A.M.P ‘ 668,793 £54,725
Mutual of Victoria .. 44,762 11,925
Mutual of Australasia 52,517 14,046
National Mutual .. 71,047 19,059
Widows’ Fund .. 55,798 11,081
M.L. Government .. 108,097 27,127
Colonial Mutual .. 81,026 55,743
The fact that sticks out conspicuously in the above table
is that the Colonial Mutual has more than twice as large
% proportion of interest and rent outstanding as any other
office. Therefore, the visible inference was that if the
other offices, in such times as the present, could collect
the interest on their mortgages so much better than does
the Colonial, the latter must have the worst and most
dangerous hatch of invest ments of the crowd. The other
possible inference was that, in some cases, instead of
showing overdue interest and rents as a separate item—
which certainly ought to be done in order to enable
policy-holders to estimate the risk of had debts, and to
form an idea of the care with which their money was
Invested—they were disguised by being added on to the
amount under the heading of “ mortgages.”
The Bulletin has since received sufficient
reasonable assurance that the funds of the Colonial
Mutual are carefully invested—generally, in the case of
mortgages, with a 50 per cent, margin—that the actual
losses are very small, and that the accumulation alluded
to arose mainly through the practical impossibility of
collecting interest in the panic year, on many safe invest-
ments, without selling up the mortgagor, hut that the
arrears were, in most casrs, well secured. Also, that the
society’s £530,000 worth or so of bricks and moitar were
mostly acquired" long before the last Australian boom,
and, being scattered all over the world, the depreciation
in some places had been covered to a great extent by a
corresponding rise elsewhere. Assuming, therefore, that
the Colonial Mutual is in a safe and normal condition, it
would be interesting to know how some of the other offices
are situated.
The itpm referred to in the Colonial Mutual’s
sheet reads, “ Interest and rents outstanding and accrued,
£55,743.” The word “ outstanding ” distinctly implies
that it includes all arrears, and the arrears are an impor-
tant item of evidence as to the security of the invest-
ments. The Mutual Life Association, Australian Widows’
Fund, National Mutual and’A.M.P. omit the word “ out-
standing,” therefore there is no evidence that in their
cases the item covers arrears. If it doesn’t cover arrears,
then these must be included in the capital sum of the
mortgages, thus making it impossible to tell the real
position of affairs. Moreover, none of the offices, save
t l e Maoriland Government Department, even professes to
s'-parate accrued interest from arrears, which makes the
information even more scat ty. Taking it all round, the
amount of information which is absent from tho average
balance-sheet is something remarkable.

According to the cable, the Maoriland Govern-
ment has tacked on to its Banking Bill a clause according
to which "the State may guarantee the note-issue of
any bank the assets of which within the colony exceed
the liabilities.” This probably means only any Maoriland
bank—the idea that the Government would guarantee
the note-issue of foreign institutions must be only a cable
aberration—and if the guarantee is accompanied, as it
certainly should be, with large powers in the way of
State inspection and supervision it is a step in the right
-direction. All currency should be as safe as a State
guarantee can make it, and if the Government doesn’t
issue it direct it should at least exercise a cast-iron super-
vision over those who do.

1 u
The fact of the co. —after its failure in N.S.W.
Assembly—having to go into liquidation, should much
weaken its position when it again applies to Parliament
to sanction its huge reach-out. Democratic members can
surely understand that they are asked to hand these
rights over to a merely speculative crowd, who, when one
attempt failed to get their measure, had to go into liquid-
ation ; and they are perfectly justified in asking the very
pertinent question-—" How can these people spend a
million of money' in erecting the works necessary to
generate the electricity when the cost of running a Bill
through Parliament leaves them on their hind legs?”
It is now more certain than ever that the Aus-
tralian Rights Co., despite their moneyed-shareholders’
list, are a merely speculative crowd, who, as soon as they
had acquired the Colo and Grose rights, would sell out to
the highest bidder, and make an enormous profit on the
deal—leaving the hona-fide purchaser to make his haul
out of a long-suffering and much-fleeced public. The duty
of every Democratic membe* is perfectly clear.

The Victorian Railway Department is seriously
considering the advisability of withdrawing the trains
from a number of hopeless little boom-lines and running
occasional horse-trains in their stead. The spectacle of t

bility in the way of a downfall. Unless, indeed, things
grow still worse, and the horse-train has to give place to

for, and in some cases only booked, orders for the local

The long-standing feud between the Adelaide
and Melbourne directors of the Central (8.H.) still breaks
out occasionally. Mr. Thomas Walker, ex-Adelaide
director, contributes to the literature on the subject a
letter which alleges that the last div. was paid out of calls
and proceeds of the sale of coke at half cost. He alleges
a loss on the ore still being sold to the Dry Creek Smelt-
ing Co., which, he says, should be avoided by starting
another of the mine durnaees. He also hints that the
Melh. hoard have been intriguing to bring about the re-
signation of Chafley Baker (Adelaide director) and the
mine-manager, who are advocates of home smelting, in
order to revert wholly to the practice of disposing of the
output to the Dry Creek Co.

chance, this being the first occasion on which it was
intended to pass right through the coal strata with a drill.

between managing the lace department for a prominent

that it yielded more money and required less judgment.

The Sydney dramatic fbte is over, and
the Melbourne one was nowhere, or even less, by
comparison. The weather probably accounted for
most of the difference; it was a cloudless day and
hot as the hob of Gehenna. Every one had his
straw baton, and his white pants, and his stomach-
girth. The lawn was full, the stand was full, and
the man who was captured late in the day in the
neighborhood of Joe Tolano’s wizard-show, and
borne away by a sympathetic friend, was full also.
This was one of the unintentional spectacles of
the performance, for the inebriated friend was
very large and comatose and the sober friend was
small and fagged out. He continued for half-an-
hour laboriously removing his tight relative, and
by that time got him only half way to the gate.
Then in despair he rolled him into a dark corner,
and lifting his own two horny hands to heaven lie
delivered himself of an apostrophe, like Mark
Antony orating over the drunk body of Csesar.
When he had finished the apostrophe he left. It
was a touching instance of family affection.

Nellie Stewart, as is her wont, secured the
best position for her tent, and the limelight was
on her all the afternoon, so to speak. The biggest
crowd was round this tent, and most of the men
came out with their hats in their hands as if
Nellie was a kind of a sacrament to be taken in a
devout spirit. Also, you paid about three times
as much for a cup of tea in this tent as in any
other, and then got it capsized down your shirt-
front in the scuffle. But in the way of confiscating
the change Violet Varley and Marietta Nash were
the most enterprising ladies on the field. The
one truly melancholy note of woe which the writer
heard in the whole afternoon was the wail of a
straw-hatted youth who came out with a glazed
look in his eye and told his griefs to a friend out-
side ; “I gave her a sovereign,” he said almost
with tears, “ and she told me she hadn’t any
change.” And then he went away and never
smiled again.
* * #
Miss Virginia Vivienne, in the intervals
between the refreshments, sold flowers on an
improved principle. You paid anything from
Is. upwards—mostly upwards—for the blossom,
and then, finding it was much too large to go into
any human button-hole, the only resource was to
sell it back again to the lovely pirate for 3d., and
leave her to owe you the 3d. She still owes it,
and the coin has gone to the aged and infirm
actors, along with the rest. There was an unpre-
meditated free show at the back of Nellie
Stewart’s tent. The canvas was somewhat brief
just here, and only came down to within a foot of
the grass, and three pairs of ankles were visible at
intervals in consequence. All the afternoon a
small crowd wandered back and forward by this
orifice, and looked hungrily at these ankles, and
asked itself which pair of black stockings was
Nellie’s and which was the property of Florence
Young. One stunted youth lay on his stomach
on the turf for two mortal hours trying to solve
the problem, and came away unsatisfied after all.
At next ffite a totalisator should be set up here,
and the stockings should.be numbered, and then
Young Australia could gamble on these extremi-
ties, less 10 per cent., which would naturally
go to the funds. Round at the back of Kate
Bishop’s hostelry things were differently con-
ducted, and no one could see an ankle here for any
sum.
Nobody was thrilled very much by the
costume football match, or by any of the other
sports save the ladies’ bicycle race, which was
won by Miss Engler in slow time and a neat blue
costume. The crowd mostly walked up and down
and smiled happily, and the occasion was a whole
essay on the teeth of Young and Middle-aged
Australia. The Bulletin doesn’t think much of
the teeth of Middle-aged Australia, anyhow. The
great want of the show was an amateur pawnshop,
with three melons over the door, and Walter
Bentley—who is Scotch—in charge, to advance
money on the watch of the broken johnny who
had spent all his cash on tea and cake with Nellie
Stewart, or who had bought one of Virginia
Vivienne’s ruinous button-holes, or who had
planked down his half-sov. to Violet Varley and
fallen a victim to that lady’s shortness of change.
Most of the tents did a roaring trade, but there
were one or two exceptions. Sterling Whyte
started business as a magician, with Joe Tolano
banging a cymbal outside and addressing the
public in a rich, moist, fruity voice, but the public
didn’t respond, and finally the pair overturned
their country residence in disgust, and went away.
And Fanny Wiseman, in a shabby little tent, like
a hatter’s domicile on a duffer rush, ran a fortune-
telling business, but nobody seemed to care for an
entertainment that had no provisions or drink in
it. So, most of the time, the witch sat there by
herself, a forlorn, neglected little fortune-teller,
and did no visible business. But, wherever there
was anything to eat or to drink, the attendant
angels could only be got at by trampling the
crowd remorselessly underfoot, and when at last
the multitude went home, full of tea and buns and
glory, the takings were -£llOO or thereabouts.
And there are no flies on a fOte which can realise
JjllOO in times like these.

The committee of the f§te is now
much troubled as to the disposal of the pro-
ceeds. The said proceeds were intended for
the assistance of distressed actors and actresses,
and the question now raised is whether they
should be distributed immediately, or whether
they should be permanently invested and only the
interest applied to charitable purposes. Con-
sidering that the interest would hardly exceed -£4O
a year, and that it would be six months before the
first miserable instalment of .£2O was available,
and further considering that the £2O, when it
came, would hardly be enough to relieve even one
distressed actress or actor, the investment
scheme looks like a foolish mockery. Moreover,
there is very little business capacity about the
profession, and the chances are almost equal that
the fund would be so carefully invested that, in
the courge of a year or two, there would be nothing
but a reconstructed deposit-receipt to show for it.
In any case, where the cash is so small and the
immediate necessities so great, the idea is just
about as brilliant as that of putting out a penny
at 3 per cent, on behalf of a blind beggar, so that
he will have something to fall back upon in his old
age. Consider the joy of being one out of a hun-
dred or more infirm old tragedians with a shadowy
joint claim on the sum of i>2o every six mouths !
It is like forwarding a donation of one prawn to
a starving army.

During the past week 4 ‘ The Mounte-
banks ” has been stopping a hole to keep the wind
away at Sydney Lyceum, and Nellie Stewart and
May Pollard have been making fitful appearances
and disappearances in the part of Teresa. It is
generally understood that something has been
wrong with thebeloved Nellie’s bronchial tubes or
her oesophagus. Three nights of “ Mikado ” begin
on Saturday, and after that the opera co. packs up
its bag and departs, to make room for a comedy
season run by a fresh crowd just arrived from
London. Said comedy season starts on Wednes-
day with the “ New Boy,” which is reported to be
a piece of extraordinary merit, run by a star
whose merit is also extraordinary.

“Julius Caesar 1 ' progresses steadily and

be re-opened on Boxing Night by Bland Holt for
a huge season of melodrama, with Misses Hilda
Spong and Virginia Vivienne as the principal
features of loveliness in lieu of Henrietta Watson
and Harrie Ireland departed. Till then the
Royal will probably remain more or less closed.
The Criterion is also empty, and there is no
present sign of it being otherwise. The circus
has gathered up its dogs and monkeys and left,
and except for a few small variety shows and a
picture of one undressed lady, there is nothing
else doing.

Mr. Arthur Garner’s benefit was an-
nounced to arise like a strong man refreshed, at
Sydney Lyceum, on Wednesday afternoon, with
a fine and varied programme, mostly of a musical
character. The exigencies of a paper which goes
to press on Tuesday night, and is published on
Thursday morning, and dated for Saturday,
make it impossible to say definitely whether the
event really arrived or not, but, unless something
of a wholly unexpected character intervened, it
probably came off in great style and proved a
financial success.
** * *
“Marjorie,” at Melbourne Alexandra, is
sufficiently well-treated by the Lyric Club to
justify fm ther performances on Friday and Satur-
day ot the pres nt week. John Wallace stage-
manages the fit’ amateurs who supply the human
element in this spectacular opera, and their
grouping suggests that Johnny’s license to “say
d —n” has been wisely enforced. Also, the
mounting is somewhat magnificent, and the
ballets—one of them by children, and the other by
maidens of marriageable age—are very welcome
revelations. Taken altogether, “Marjorie” is
more than was expected of the Lyric Club. The
name part is prettily spoken and tastefully
sung by Miss Lily Maddooks, a fair young novice,
whose indisposition to assert herself forms a
striking contrast to the sprightly assurance of
Miss Mabelle Davidson, as little Cicely. The
male principals are the saddest things in the
show. Some of them are much more har-
rowing than others, but they all harrow a
good deal. The amorous Norman earl bears
himself with conscious ease and amateur non-
chalance, but he has a fixed expression that leaves
something to be desired. The low comedian,
although mechanically funny at times, would
probably be more at home as Richard the Third.
Then there is a tall young man of the meet-you-
on-the-Blook species, condemned by fate to imper-
sonate Gosric’s cook and jester, but even he is
naught compared with the tenor. The tenor is a
fragile little flower, rendered conspicuous by the
smallness of his head and general want of features
suitable for stage effect. For which matter, the
johnnies of the chorus are not rich in skull-
developrnent. Though many of them suffer
from swollen head you wouldn’t think it to look
at them.

“Morocco Bound” has nearly run its
course at the Princess’s. Fresh songs were intro-
duced on Saturday night, but they will not make

The Taylor-Carrington crowd, at Melb.
Royal, is growing desperate and changing its
bill twice a week. Last Saturday it was a version
of Fergus Hume’s hansom cab story—that sickest
of successful shilling dreadfuls—produced under
the alias of “Mysteriesof Melbourne.” On Wed-
nesday the co. was to try “ Our Strategists,” a
farcical comedy with an up-country reputation for
extravagant humor. “Rip Van Winkle” is an
awful treat reserved for Saturday next.
** * *
The Bijou show, which improved rapidly
after the first night, is an object of growing
respect. Edwin Kelly, an artist with a stately
presence, took his place beside the beauteous
Miss Leslie Nor man in the nigger part as though he
were the ducal father of that lady come to see that
the tambourine and bones men behaved them-
selves nicely. The Bijou evidently intends to
win a name for doing something different from
the ordinary ’all programme in a superior,
gilt-edged style. Offenbach’s “Ohoufleuri” is
a musical gem, a charming little bit of mock
Italian opera, and the two-shilling dress-circle
begins dimly to understand that Miss Marie
Elster is the best operatic soprano now singing in
Australia. The music, as stated last week, is
capitally rendered in all parts, including a small
part taken by Miss Isabel Stuart. Now that the
singers are warming to their acting business, and
the ballet makes itself appreciated at its proper
worth, the Bijou ought to boom. The Coghills,
with an old and orthodox variety display, have
long been booming at the little theatre downstairs.

An expert, who was constant in his attendance at the
rehearsals of “The Second Mrs. Tanqueray," affirms
that what is artistically good in Mrs. Brough’s con-
ception of the part is chiefly Boucicaull's. She
considered it her duty to win the sympathies of the
audience, a task which could not be performed by the
real Paula Tanqueray.' By the way, in the London
Directory for ’92 appear the names of several Tanquerays.

A “duffers’ concert” was recently held for charitable
purposes at Greyiown (M.L.). The one qualification
insisted on was that none of the performers should be
able to sing, and the result was a gathering of all the
saw-like voices for miles round. Any performer who
showed any sign of owning a singing voice was promptly
hooted off the stage as an impostor, while the olhers were
encored and urged to lift up their tuneless roar unto
seventy times seven. Consequently they screamed till far
into the morning.

What is fame? A Melb. paper devoted a column to a

in a carriage-accident. The interest of the story was
supposed to lie in Miss Harding’s personal celebrity. The

figured in the report as the “premiere danseuse” in

attire. At last the next-biggest man in the co. produced
a garment which came down a little way below the
victim’s knees, and Augustus started for home in it amid
great popular excitement, and ran for his life the whole
way.

Justice Boucaut, of S.A., will be 63 on
Monday, Oct. 29.
Graham Berry says he will not wear a wig
as Speaker of Vic. Assembly. Graham is going
in baldheaded.
Dr. O’Hara, of Melbourne, had a lame
hand after “ plugging ” Purves. It is bad policy
to land any lawyer on the jaw.
Recent events almost made it opportune
to declare Tom Butler, of Sydney Freeman’s
Journal, a Knight of St. Gregory.
The late Dr. Oliver Wendell Holmes and
Baronet Clarke (Vic.) were posted honorary
LL.D’s. at Cambridge on the same list.
Why is Rev. Geo. Walters, Unitarian
pastor of Sydney and Melbourne, so persistently
described in the press as a “Christian” clergy-
man ?
Purves, Q.C., got in with his left an art-
ful blow upon O’Hara. But not during the street
fight. Afterwards, in conversation with a news-
paper reporter.
Mr. ex-Surveyor-General Goyder, of S.A.,
who lately retired after more than 40 years’ service
with .£4OOO compensation, has started private
practice in Adelaide,
Attorney Bleechmore, business partner of
the long-headed S.A. Crown Solicitor, Stuart, has
been christened by sarcastic Villeneuve Smith,
“the half-Crown Solicitor.
Earl Grey, who has just died, aged 92,
was the Minister controlling the colonies in Lord
Melbourne’s administration, when Victoria and
South Australia were founded.
A new R.C. magazine, Australasian in
character, will appear, under episcopal direction,
about the end of the year; and Card. Moran will
probably lead off the literature.
The wills of the late Robert Rand, of
Albury, and J. B. Tickle, of Sydney, have been
proved at £424,206, and <£39,665 ; but in neither
case is a single copper left to charity.
The S.A. Treasurer, who looks ghoulishly
on the rich dead, hopes to gain from <£25,000 to
<£30,000 by the death of John Dunn, of Mount
Barker, who was reputedly worth <£250,000.
Rev. Father Curran, geologist, is per-
manently attached to N.S.W. Technical College.
Th eologically and scientifically, Father Curran is
taking to the footsteps of the late Tenison-Woods.
Since his accession to office, N.S.W.
Premier Reid has plainly let the daily newspapers
see that they don’t own his soul. They are fairly
astonished, as they had hoped to absolutely run the
country.
Ex-Chief-Justice Stephen did not long
survive the release of Bertrand, which he had ever
strongly opposed. And he died, curiously enough,
at nine o’clock on Monday morning, the time
usually fixed for executions.
It was in a room full of bookmakers at the
Victoria Hotel, Geelong, after the Geelong races
(says To-Day), and Mr. Andrew Chirnside was
boasting. The bookmakers stood it for some time
and then Barney Thompson said to him : “ What’s
the good of your blowing about your money? A
log could have made it when you did.”
Few people are aware that the
great Melbourne drapery business of
Buckley and Nunn (sold to a syndicate
some time back) owed much to the
shrewdness of the late Farmer, founder
of the well-known Sydney soft-goods
house. In 1848, when Bourke-street,
Melb., was a very dull thoroughfare, as
compared with Collins-street, Buckley
and Nunn started operations in a tiny
shop, upon a bit of land leased from
a potato-dealer, whose tubers they
helped to cart away. Farmer coming
over from Sydney in search of Mel
bourne “investments” was struck by
the idea that these young beginners
were likely to make a bit. Negotia-
tions between the parties resulted in
Farmer buying the land round about
the infant store, and building a con-
siderable portion of the present Buck-
ley and Nunn premises, at a total cost
of <£20,000. The rent of the new “em-
porium ” was : fixed at .£3OOO, and the
first year’s trading therein yielded a
profit of .£20,000. In due course Buck-
ley and Nunn took the property over
from their Sydney landlord, who had
done so well for his proteges, and by
them. Fanner it was who first saw
the large business possibilities of the
Bourke-street site; but the success of
Buckley and Nunn was hastened by
their own smartness in advising another
young draper to open a rival shop next
door to them and so help to make a.
market. The business known as Robert-
son and Moffatt’s started four month*
after Buckley and Nunn’s, and during
the next 40 years the opposition firms-
waxed fat together.
Theo. Fink and R. W. Best, who are
partners as solicitors, are both members of Vic.
Parliament. J. G. Duffy and his late partner, J.
Wilkinson, were also at the same time members of
Vic. Legislative Assembly.
About 20 out of the 33 members of the
Westralian Leg. Assembly are Australian natives,
including the whole of the Forrest Ministry save
the Attorney-General. The Piesident of the
Leg. Council is also an Australian.
A definite announcement will soon be
made about the probable date of publication of the
late Alfred Stephen’s autobiography. The work
has been in hands over 15 years, and will con-
stitute almost a history of Australasia.
Wall Fat, 83 years old, long a paid
Wesleyan Chinese missionary in Melbourne, is
dead. Such men encounter the difficulties of a
Foj Chow missionary whose paid catechumens
said, “People tell us we speak Jesus’ words
because we eat Jesus’ rice.”

“ Suppose the news came that General
Booth had taken a young wife?” Well, The
Bulletin predicts that the news will come. Any
well-preserved old saint with such a hook-nose,
knuckly fingers, and glittering eye, is sure to
take a wife—a young wife.
“Handsome Charley Lett” is still in full
force at the Imperial Institute. His strong point
at present is N.S. Wales meat, which he sells
direct from the Institute. His Australian friends
now mostly drop around the corner when they see
him coining, for fear of receiving a butcher’s bill.
Old man Parkes (who as an M.P., of
course, travels free) was asleep in a corner of the
Leichhardt (Sydney) tram the other night, when
the conductor woke him up and demanded his
ticket. “Do you mean to tell me,” indignantly
exclaimed H. Parkes, “ that you don’t know who
lam ?” Blasphemy !
The Age re Dean Macartney’s burying :
It was the largest funeral ever given to a Melb. clergy-
man, and the good old dean deserved it.
There are lots of men remaining in Melbourne
who deserve pretty large funerals. The Age has
a neat turn for compliments.
Yankee Ned, of York Island, Torres
Straits, is an “identity.” He owns two Islands
and a sable queen of his own, and boasts that he
has spent <£sooo in drink and miscellaneous hospi-
talities. Ned recently surprised the Torresian
pearlers by finding a beautiful pearl valued at
.£2OOO.
It is indeed appropriate, to those who know
the men, that N.S.W. Justice Windeyer should
thank deceased Judge Stephen “for the many
lessons of judicial wisdom of which I have had the
benefit since I first practised before him in 1857.”
For, of a surety, to this Elisha hath the mantle of
that Elijah descended.
The luck of 13 again. A Sydney girl, the
youngest of 13 children, was born on 13th May.
Her mother died when this girl was 13 years old,
and she married a worthless sweep in that same,
her 13th, year. And she stood it for 13 years,
until the wretch shot himself by mistake for her.
So she had some luck, after all. But what’s ahead
of that girl ?
They call ex-Speaker Bent “the Cheerful
Giver ” in Melbourne now, because he so cheer-
fully gave his 36,000 shares, with a .£9OOO call on
them, to M‘Mahon, and left him to be sold up for
the liability. The title is derived from that text
which says that “the Lord loveth a cheerful
giver.” This is the only time on record when the
Lord has loved Tom Bent.
Vic. millionaire Clarke is an excellent
landlord —as good even as Burdekin, of Sydney.
There is not a poor man on his estates around
Creswick and Ballarat, writes a Bulletin corres-
pondent. All are well-to-do and occupy splendid
residences, erected by the owner. The rent paid
is extremely moderate, and many tenants would
offer double before giving up the land.

the journalist, used to say : “We keep up the
martyr’s tradition in the family to this day, and
you will find some Stephen making a martyr of
himself in the Civil Service of nearly every
English-speaking country in the world.”
G rose, who unseated Richardson, late Vic.
Rail A ny Minister, at Oreswick, was, after the elec-
tions, introduced by Peacock to Shiels. The latter,
whose language is always eloquent and free,
warmly congratulated Grose on ridding the House
of the sanctimonious Richardson. “Yes,” con-
tinued Shiels, with numerous colored interpola-
tions, “you never know when you’ve got these
Wesleyan preachers; you can never trust
them.” The volatile ex-Premier wondered at
Grose’s silent acceptance of his congratulations,
but, later on, when Peacock informed him that
Richardson’s successor was himself a Wesleyan
devil-whacker, Shiels understood.
Justice Harding (Q.) is said to rank in the
front row of the Australian Judges whose judg-
ments have escaped the over-rule.
Sydney Daily Telegraph is getting the
full benefit of evangelist M’Neill’s mission. A
Bible was added to the library last week, and two
members of the staff have been “saved.” Halle-
lujah ! Which reminds us of something. At a
big gospel meeting of some sort a few years ago,
the chief shepherd came over to the table and
solemnly said to a scribe : “ Brother, are you
•saved?” “No,” replied the dot-and-stroker,
“ I’m a reporter.”
Who will be the next Victorian Chief
Commissioner of Police in succession to Mr.
Chomley, the very best and most popular chief
of police any Australian province has ever
had ? About six of the officers next in
rank to Mr. Ohornley are due, by the operation
of the sexagenarian rule, to depart about
the same time, so that the new man would
be heavily handicapped. If a “ranker”
were selected, it would have to be Supt.
Parkinson, of Ballarat; but, as a pro-
nounced Orangeman, he would be hardly
suitable besides, he must retire 15
months after Mr. Chomley. Penal
Inspector - General Evans is going
strong for the post, but is not
officially favored. The difficulty
will probably be surmounted
by the retention of Mr.
Chomley for a further term,
during which his successor
might be selected and trained.
Premier Kingston is the
youngest of Australian govern-
mental heads, Patterson dates
from 1833, Reid from ’44, For-
rest from ’47 and Kingston
from ’5O. M‘ll wraith, Seddon
and Braddon are all growing mellow
with years.
The Bulletin now notices that it has
erroneously attributed the recent extraordinarily
successful operation for ovarian tumor on a lady
87 years old to “ Dr. Owen,” instead of to the real
operator, Dr. Matthews Owens, of Brisbane.
Old George Bates, who had lived on
Kangaroo Island since 1824, which is 12 years
before the first Governor arrived in S.A., was
admitted to Adelaide Destitute Asylum, Oct. 9.
He. is 95 years old, but still able to talk clearly
concerning the scenes witnessed in his boyhood.
Much indignation is felt at the action of the
Govt, in carrying him away from his old home,
but the authorities aver that he could not have
been properly treated on the island.
Thus perorated N.S.W. Chief Jus.me
Darley, himself an enhandled personage :
Yes, the Right Honourable Sir Alfred Stephen is dead,
and New South Wales may well mourn this day.” . . .
His Honor (adds S.M. Herald) was visibly affected while
making this deliverance, and almost broke down before
concluding.
Which touches the very climax of bathos. “The
Right Honourable Sir Alfred Stephen is dead !”
Why didn’t Darley, C. J., say, while he was about
it: “Yes, the Right Honourable Sir Alfred
Stephen, P.C., G.C.M.G., &c., is dead”? It
would only have been one whit more pompously
absurd.
South Australia’s oldest public man died
Saturday, Oct. 13, in the person of John Dunn, of
Mount Barker, founder of the big milling firm
bearing his name. Born in 1802, he arrived in the
province in 1840, was elected to the first Parlia-
ment under representative government in 1857,
and, after eleven years’ service in the Assembly,
transferred his affections to the Council, finally
retiring from politics in ’77. At one time he and
his two sons all sat in the Legislature together.
He had little education, but plenteous energy, and
his fortune stands in six figures. He married,
when past 70, as his second wife, a sister of the
spouse of his son, but the only child, despite the
fact that it was baptised in water from the river
Jordan, did not survive. He built a windmill
unaided in ’4l, and made the patterns for the
machinery with his own hands. Then he humped
them 20 miles to Port Adelaide, and sent them to
Sydney to be cast, afterwards carrying the iron-
work back on his shoulders to Hay Valley. He
never wearied of telling the friends of his old age
how hard he worked when he was young. During
the whole of his 92 years he never smoked, drank,
or swore, reserving all the energy which would
have been devoted to those vices to assisting in
the task of living to 100, an age he was very am-
bitious of reaching. Till within the last few
months he had continued hale, hearty, hard-
working, and cheerful, but at the beginningof the
winter he began to break up, and the last
unseasonable weather finished him. He was short,
stout, and waddlesome, but otherwise of splendid
physique. This is printed for the benefit of The
Bulletin’s readers not in South Australia. They,
poor wretches! —as explained in last issue—dread
John Dunn pars, more than they dread the Gawler
bunyip.
The privileges of a lawyer in Australia are
so extensive that one never takes up a paper with-
out hearing about something new in that direc-
tion. Recently, R. H. Levien, a Sydney lawyer,
made some offensive remarks about two witnesses
on the other side, and, by way of getting level,
thqpair followed him into the street and made
sundry remarks, equally offensive, concerning
him. Whereupon Levien tramped stolidly back
to the magistrate and complained, and the two
witnesses were fined ,£lO each for “ contempt of
court.” They didn’t make their remarks in the
court, and they didn’t make them about the court,
therefore, the only possible inference is that
Levien, or any other solicitor, is the court in his
own person, no matter where he may be, and that
contempt of Levien is an offence punishable by
law. AnyooJy who wants to feel contemptuous
about a solicitor—even if he is a newly-admitted
solicitor who hasn’t grown any hair on his face
yet—should make a note of this.
“The woman loves continuously. The
man has entr’actes.”
Major William Collard Smith, who was a
member of the Berry Black Wednesday Ministry
is dead. He was a genial old (volunteer) warrior'
and was chiefly known to fame by the jokes made
about his immense feet. The story about the
horse, unbroken to harness, at once allowing the
major to ride him on the ground that the major’s
feet irresistibly reminded him of shafts, i, as
become an Australian classic. Also, the major
when Minister of Education, spelled “until’’
with two “ l’s ” and “ recommend ” with one “ m.”

Purves, Q.C., who spoke, no doubt, hast ily
and merely in the fulness of his liver, should at
once have apologised to Surgeon O’Hara for in-
sinuating that the 1000 guineas he said he hud
received for an operation was for an illegal opera-
tion. For, had he said or written such a thing
outside court, the surgeon could have got from
him enormous damages, inasmuch as the accusa-
tion, if true, was one under which O’Hara might
have been sent to gaol for life.

JOHN DUNN, horn Feb. 13, 1802; died
Oct. 13, 1894.
Thirty years ago the late N.S.W. Chief
Justice Stephen was trying an alleged horse-thief
at Bathurst. Prisoner, who defended himself,
before addressing the jury, handed to the Judge,
through the sheriff, a neatly-bound “shilling
shocker” of the period, and thus prefaced ilia
speech: “Your Honor will find something to
interest you during my address to the jury, which
will necessarily be long and tedious. I regret
that the rules of court prevent me from entertain-
ing the jury with light literature.” He got off.
Within the last 18 months six ships, coal-
laden, have left Newcastle, N.8.W., and have

trirnmed cargo is supposed to account for the dis-
appearances. And the sailors !

A Swiss cigar manufactory claims to have dis-
covered a new method for treating tobacco prior
to its being rolled into cigars, by which the greater
part of the essential volatile elemetit, viz.,.nicotine,-
is released. By thus evaporating the tobacco in
vacuo, Messrs. J. Erossard & Co. have made a
cigar called Cavour, remarkable for its mildness
and aroma. It is specially suited for smokers in
hot climates. The Cavour cigar contains a smaller
percentage of nicotine than any other cigar, and,
consequently, can be indulged in without injurious
effect on the nerves. This new manufacture has
been approved of by the highest medical authori-
ties in Switzerland, and as the cigars are sold in
packets of eight for one shilling only, they ought
to become soon popular here.

POINTS
Go wcu Evans, of the Argus, revolu-
tionises quicker than any of the politicians.
Forty of the present members of N.S.W.
Leg. Council are Parkes’ nominees. “Forty ! ”
“Tub Bulletin, that powerful stain on
the Australian character.”—lsis Advocate (Q.
nig. -labor organ).
Victoria has now a political “ Reform
Club.” So far, however, it has no political Per-
form Club.
Victoria’s “ defences ” cost her £216,000
a year. She is praying heaven to defend her from
her defences.
An absentee-tax was only popped into
Vic. Premier Turner’s manifesto at the last
moment—it had to be written in the printed docu-
ment, in fact.
Belgium has now got absolute manhood
suffrage, with compulsory voting. “ A call to the
polling-booth can no more be disregarded than a
call to arms.”
Fully 30 per cent, of the chemists and
druggists practising in N.S. Wales will be dis-
qualified for that occupation if the proposed Phar-
macy Bill be carried.
In superannuation, a lesson may be taken
from the Thespians. The £2O-a-week actor is
glad enough to take £5 later. The Civil Service
man can never step down, but only out. Why not?
It is said the N.S.W. “solidarity ” Ms.P.
pass all their spare time caUcussing. The pioneer
Labor Ms.P. tried the game, and nearly caueussed
each other to death. The Oauoussian soon gets
played out.
, Sargood says that one reason why he insists
upon imported officers for the Vic, “army”
is that the elevation of local warriors would lead
to “no end of jealousy.” The' Bulletin suggests
t(ie advisability of importings a British Minister of
Defence for the reason that no local person with
horse-sense seems to be available.
“ Her Majesty heaped on him the highest
honors in her bestowal,” said Griffith, C.J. (Q.),
in adding his portion of slobber to the deceased
N.S.W. ex-Judge Stephen’s little, pile, “and he
valued them, as every good man does.” Now,
Queen Victoria didn’t give Judge Stephen “the
highest honors in her bestowal,” and in talking as
above the Northern political Judas is only apolo-
gising for his own pitiful personal position.
Victoria’s butter-
export to England this
year will be valued
oyer £1,000,000. Yet
the butter-trade is
moitly of “ artificial ”
origin, in the good old
Freetrade phrase. The
trade was a miserably
poor affair for many
years, and at l£tet it
nearly flickered out.
Then the Vic. Govern-
ment started it afresh
with an export bonus,
and even with that the
Agricultural Depart-
ment had to collect
the first season’s cargo
and supervise its ship-
ment ; in fact, the busi-
ness was dragged into
eixistence by main force.
Yet in five years it
grew to be one of the
biggest things in Vic-
toria, and the fact
that an indmtry can
be artificially created
and yet be a stupendous
success is demonstrated
bpyond dispute. More-
over, Victorian butter
is now cheaper that it
ev ir was before to the
Ipoal consumer, becau.se
it is made in vast quan-
tities by the best
labor-saving apparatus;
and it is also better
because the British
buyer wouldn’t stand
the old kind of pro-
duct, and it improved
as a matter of neces-
sity. An effort is now
being made to create a
similar “artificial ” in-
dustry in cheese, and
as the export has ex-
panded in 18 months
from about £3OO worth
tp nearly £20,000
Worth this trade also
promises well.
; Nothing rilore conclusively proves the
value, for party purposes, of the possession of a
flight to a dissolution than Dibbs’ nagging at Reid
dn the subject. A Premier who holds a power to
Absolve is practically a dictator. All the small-
in Parliament flock, to him at the sound
of his whistle. Parkes’ first remark to a friend
when Carington once endowed him with this
power was : “ I feel now' like Oliver Cromwell!”
Squatter Riddoclq M.P. (S.A.), so often
speaks of “ my class ” privately and publicly, that
he is nicknamed “My Class Riddocb.” Riddoch,
by the way, actually had the gall to openly blame
Geo. Hawker for voting with the Govt, on the
taxation resolutions, because “ the gentleman
must have known that the tax would prejudicially
affect his brother landowners,”
Justice limes, in sentencing at Dubbo
(N.S.W.) a number of rioters to terms of im-
prisonment, twice called a bush road “ the Queen’s
Highway.” Australia is so free and independent
that even its inland tracks belong to a foreigner
who never heard of them, never set eyes on Aus-
tralia, and only knows Australians by its worst
samples whom she degrades with knighthood.
Australian bush-tracks haven’t even got legal
names of their own.
Parkes believes he is making political
headway. He regards his Federation backing as
solid ; he considers he has posted himself as leader
of the Labor-party by pegging at Reid to make
the prohibition of the alien influx a question of
urgency, and he gathered a majority of the House
under him at the Local Option division. How to
invent a motion which will weld these three
parties to him is now the puzzle. The puzzle
solved, down goes Reid without benefit of clergy.
Good old Pastor Bevan wants the Con-
gregational Union to send a protest to France
against her threatened annexation of Madagascar,
and tell the Republic straight out that she is
“ doing wrong.” One never hears of a French or
German preacher sending a protest to the British
Government when it grabs Burmah, or Zululand,
or Egypt, or some other slice of territory. The
so-called “ Anglo-Saxon ” sin-shifter seems_ to be
the only one who has sufficient cheek for this kind
of foolishness.
Melb. Argus seeks to persuade the
workers against favoring the imposition of any
taxes on the rich on the ground that—
The more money is taken out of the pocket of the
individual citizen the less that man has to spend in the
employment of labour or in goods for his family.
As if capitalists -employ labour to benefit the
the labourers ! They don’t. They employ labour
to benefit themselves. Let the Argus talk like
this when next it is proposed to reduce wages in a
particular trade!
According to Brisbane Courier, repre-
sentatives of the Presbyterian Church lately
visited Mackay to report on the condition of the
Kanakas. They found IGOO Kanakas serving
under a re-engagement—“ thus proving that
Queensland has superior attractions to the
islands.” It may also prove that the Polynesian
doesn’t care to risk being landed on the wrong
island and eaten ; also, that he thinks he might as
well stay as be forced to return by the club of his
bribed chieftain.
It is quite on the cards that the unwieldy

When G. H. Reid, now N.S.W. Premier,
was in Opposition, he announced publicly that iu
the case of I rank Smith, the imprisoned bank-
director, “the law had been fully and awfully
vindicated ” by one year’s imprisonment, and he
demanded his release from Premier Dibbs in the
emphatic terins; More than half his present
colleagues joined him in this demand. Now,
Premier Rddhas decided that Smith shall notbe
released until he has served three years of his
Btmtence , Therefore, Reid is either keeping in
gaol a man whom lie knows ought to be at liberty,
™ «!*> he formerly announced in the most absolute
terms that the same man should be at liberty well
knowing that he ought to : be iu gaol. In cither
demanded that Premier Dibbs should
have the courage to do what he hasn t the courage
to do himself, and he looks tolerably mean over
the business whichever way it is considered.
The Yic. Employers’ Union has gone back
on the decision of its delegates, and refused to
experiment in the matter of arbitration, as was
agreed upon by representatives of Trades Hall,
Chamber of Commerce, and Employers’ Union.
The Union is content to leave the merits of its
case to the arbitrament of starvation.

INTRICACIES OF MAORILAND POLITICS.
1ST CITIZEN: “There’s Plunkett; well, e’s all right—hut as for Poll
Early, she don’t get no vote o’ mine on princerple. I can’t
stand these ’ere strongminded wimmin mixin' up in politics

D. J. Duggan, M.L.A., of Tarnagulla,
Vic., reminds his constituents, who, since his
return, have troubled him over much with the
extended hat: —
I was not returned to finance every institution in the
district out of its troubles. I propose to put the salary
allowed to me as your member into my own pocket, and,
further, I propose to endeavour to honestly earn that
salary.
Too many electors regard payment of members as
something in the nature of a municipal subsidy.
From a manifesto issued by the Australian
Socialist League :
There are two great classes of society. The one, the
capitalists, own land and Capital; the other, the workers,
own nothing except the power to labor.
The intermediary and greater class, the lions in
the path of Socialism, viz., the workers who own
something more than the power to labor, are con-
veniently lost sight of. Parkes said, in America,
that in and around Sydney a greater average of
workers own their own homes than in any other
town in the world.
Jenkin Coles, of S.A., proposes, as the
alternative to an increased land-tax, that the
eight-hour system should be abolished on the rail-
ways. By making every man work 10 or 12 hours
he reckons on saving .£25,000 a year and making
further taxation unnecessary. The idea was so
utterly foolish that no one even proposed to
listen while the out-of-date Jenkin was talking,
and when he had finished the Assembly walked
right over his mangled dust, so to speak, and
carried the Land-tax proposals by a good majority.
The old Tory party in S.A. is only a voice crying
aloud on an abandoned station these times.
The locomotives seemed to shake,
A tremor filled each vacuum-brake ;
The permanent way
Seemed festive and gay,
And so did every semaphore.
Grins broke out on the station clocks,
And merriment wreathed each signal-box,
The sleepers awoke,
Into laughter broke,
Making a regular railleryJroar
As, mile after mile,
Spread the railway smile
When Richardson was no more.
Molb. Argus publishes the screed of
“ Farmer’s Son ” —probably a member of the staff
—showing how a prohibitive tariff would naturally
“increase the producer’s burden.” The manu-
facturers, being relieved from all fear of outside
competition, might form a ring and raise the price
of every article by 100 per cent. It doesn’t occur
to the woolly-headed freetrader that protection
from outside competition must inevitably stimu-
late inside competition. This “ring” theory is
the thinnest of bogies. The result of a ring would
be a crop of new manufacturers, each striving to
be the first to capture the ring’s trade. Besides,
it is open to the public to form co-operative manu-
facturing companies for the destruction of any
grasping fools who attempted to plunder the
market.
Major-General Tulloch, in a recent address
in Victoria, said that the dear old mother-country
would some day avail itself of three regiments
raised in Australia to fight in Afghanistan. Is
the Sepoy getting tired of fighting his kinsman,
the Afghan, for his gracious Empress (whom ha
has never seen), or is he get ti"g tired of soldiering?
The Argus denies
that it is “ conserva-
tive ” and claims to
be a “ Liberal ” paper.
It insists that a Con-
servative cannot exist
in Victoria. They
have had a tough time
lately.
The chairman of a
Melb. hat factory, who
also happens to be con-
nected with the Free-
trade interest, objects
to having the success
of the hat-making busi-
ness credited to Pro-
tection entirely. It is
largely due to Protec-
tion, writes this funny
little man, but splendid
management has also
a Jot to do with it.
Then he (a mere figure-
head in the business,
anyway) observes that
“ with tlie same energy
and forethought ap-
plied to other indus-
tries now languishing
in the colony there is
little doubt but that
they could be made
equally successful.”
Which, coming from
a boon companion of
importers, is good
enough to treasure in
the memory. A very
heavy duty on hats
has enabled the Mel-
bourne factory to
flourish with the assist-
ance of careful manage-
ment, and the same
wise administration
would do likewise for
other industries —in
their present state of
Protection. But not
if the Government re-
duces their Protection
on the Free trade
ground that they
haven’t achieved “ the
hoped-for results.” Ad-
vocates of a 25 per
cent, maximum will
have to chew the letter
of this hat - factory
chairman when Tariff
Reform comes before
the Assembly.
The Marquis of Qneeusberry lost his son
last week by a trim-accident, and now it is reported
that the young wife he married the other day is
petitioning fur a decree of nullity of marriage.
The Sydney railway extension from Red-
fern to Cir ular Quay must come sooner or later,
but when the line is made it should be done by
tunnelling the entire distance. Tunnelling is ex-
pensive, certainly, but not one-tenth as expensive
as the resumption of pri vate,property according to
the fraudulent plan which now prevails. Nearly
every person who now advocates the Circular
Quay extension is interested in property on the
way, which he proposes to sell to the State at six-
teen times its value, and nearly everybody who
violently advocates some particular route for the
line does so because his own little tenement lies on
that route, and lie is afraid lest the line may go
in some other direction and he won’t be “re-
sumed.” Highway robbery and garrotting are
honest employments compared with the resump
tion of land for public purposes.

Between fill living men and the next
world, if there is any next world, stands a wall
through which no man has seen or can ever see.
He who believes that he can interview, through
any medium whatsoever, the ghosts of the
departed, is mad or on the verge of madness. If
you think you see a ghost, hit it on the skull with
a half-brick. Or, if you can manage to administer
to the spook of “ Cissie,” who likes lollies, a
chocolate-cream containing a stiff dose of jalap or
croton oil it will be equally efficacious in burst-
ing up “ the circle.”
Spiritualism is a delusion, the methods whereof
have been exposed a thousand times in a hundred
different countries. There are living scores of
men who can, by avowed trickery,.perform all the
feats whereby the weak-brained and credulous
semi-epileptics of Sydney, the poor people with
goggle eyes and far-away stares, have lately been
duped. Regrettably incomplete as is the exposure
of the Sydney dodgery, compared with what
might have been, it will at least be the means of
confronting Mrs. Mellon;-in any future Australian
seances, with test-conditions under which she will
absolutely and ignominiously fail, even as every
other spiritualist similarly tested has absolutely
failed.
The Sydney Judge who was for long so ardent a
spiritist, has sustained a great shock through the
Mellon affair. His Honor doesn’t believe in Mrs.
Mjellon now, and is perfectly-astonished that she
could have been mixed up in such operations.
The hard-headed, porridge-eating Scotch doctors
of;-Sydney are now jeering at the dreadful anti-
climax in the scientific career of their impression-
able Irish professional .brother. You can’t humbug
a Scotch doctor with a black beard and a box of
chocolate-creams any more than you can with the
Marble Man.

M‘Neill, the roaring evangelist, who is
winning notoriety by a dexterous transfer to the
pulpit of the methods pf the sixpenny circus,
devotes special attention to Business Men. They
are the salt of the earth, and they have money ;
so: roaring evangelists invariably give them the
ton seat in the synagogue and the top line in the
bills. As Marcus Clarke inimitably puts it: —
Vou may work like a horse, and give all your goods to
fegd the poor, but if you ate not a Business Man you are
sounding brass or a tinkling cymbal. To be a Business
Man is a special gift -a sort of inherent virtue, like a cast
in jthe eye. If you are a Business Man you will succeed in
Business —that* is to.say, you will be a good husband, a
foiid father, a conscientious' Christian, always vote with
the Government, and when you die you will go straight
to<Heaven. If you are a Business Man, people will shout
for you, the papers Will write you up, and your friends
will give you prayer-books with gilt-edges.
M‘Neill is evidently a Business Man. So is
.M‘Neill’s god. - - \

A nasty knock for some people, adminis-

petition for Mi's. Needle’s reprieve. “If the
di-ath penalty be the deterrent it is claimed to be,
t|en why do not onr public men and Our press

refined robbers of Melbourne, who have driven to
the grave hundreds of respectable citizens, and
temporarily ruined the whole country? If we
successfully deter from murder, are there not
,urgent reasons why we must similarly deter in
Melbourne from crimes of gigantic fraud which
threaten the very foundations of modern society?”
Herewith The Bulletin .begs to-advocate the
hanging of numerous ex-bank directors who have

they nearly fell down with fright.

that Government should give £3 3s. to every
woman qualifying herself, rather than exact that
sum from her.

Pentridge prison-made boots are becoming
very popular in Vic. public service. One building

the boots, the wearers of which are known by what
is happily called the “ Lirnbo limp.”

Much against bis own wish, but in defer-
ence to the opinion of several prominent Sydney
supporters, St. M‘Neill has allowed requests for
prayer to be made at some of his meetings.. As a
result, this part of the meeting is breezily
humorous. “For my mother-in-law” was the
despondent and soul-reaching wail of a sallow-
faced, hen-pecked man. “ For worldly ministers,”
was a fervent appeal, which M‘Neill clinched by
saying—“ probably brought .down by their con-
gregations.” The blatant shepherd ought to be
heartily sick of the “request ” business, produc-

The uselessness of an editor is strikingly
illustrated by Miss Constance Slay Macnamara,
a Rue Australian young liiciy, whose pa (formerly
of South port, Q., Bulletin) now runs a Para-
guayan paper. “ Father doesn’t even know how
to drive a nail in straight,"’ says the ingenuous
Constance'May in a recent letter, “and mother
and I-dug holes in the,floor to put our bedposts
in.” So it was perhaps) just as well that Mae.
retired from Lane’s Eden soon after the creation.
1 he than who earns the contempt of his women-
folk by-inability to drive a nail in straight may be
able .to shift the earth with the Archimedean
lever, but he will never make a “ true mate ” in

editor is in the same fix. Not one of them would
miss his fingers five times in seven.

Thrilled by the soft sensation,
And into music broke.

More beautiful than Phoebe,
When first she woke to love,
And on Endymion sleeping
Her sweet, shy kiss bestowed,
In,bliss his senses steeping
Until the cup o’erllowed.
Were you the goddess Luna,
And I the Latmian youth,
I’d think the frozen moon a
Bright land of love and truth ;
If Phoebus’ rays wore missing,
Love’s self should give the light;
We’ d see enough for kissing
Though it were always night.

But, though you may not she be,
Like her you’re to be won ;
Sure, such a lovely charmer . “
Will make some lover blest,
Ev’n if Diana’s armour
Should guard her beauteous breast.

N.S.W. Judge Wiudeyer remained fogged
for several days lately as to whether or not a

The Judge’s wife and women righters generally,
all through the Madame Sterling fever, logically
insisted that women are and should be so citable.

Mr. J. J. Fitzgerald (whose portrait appears in
this week’s Bulletin) seems to have had so much
more than his share of peril on land and water.
When a boy, he accompanied Major Warburton
on his exploring journey ; later, he was one of the
party which brought the remains of Burke and
Wills back to Melbourne; and in 1875, at the
wreck of the Gothenburg in Flinders Passage,
between Bowen and Townsville (Q.), he
distinguished himself by special bravery in
life-saving. The Gothenburg ran on the
Perar reef in very dirty weather, and
remained for several hours apparently in no
danger ; but when the alarm had subsided the
captain put the engines astern, lifted the steamer
off into deep water, and she sank at once, drown-
ing 102 souls like rats. Mr. Fitzgerald’s conduct
received special notice from the Government and
people of South Australia. And now, at the
recent wreck of the Rodondo, off Esperance Bay
(W.A.), he gets high credit for courage and
presence of mind displayed in helping helpless
passengers.

Dear Bulletin, Your correspondent,
who pointed out the iniquities of the Australian
police, especially in re their brutal treatment of
inebriates, deserves gratitude. But let me draw
attention to how the police sometimes deal vvitli
helpless girls. An up-country hotel-keeper adver-
tised for a female cook. A decent Sydney
suburban girl applied and got the position. She
didn’t suit, however, and was “sacked” at the
end of the first week. With her wages, and a few
shillings, she railed to a township further inland.
In the carriage she made the acquaintance of a
young woman, to whom she related her troubles.
This young woman was going to the same town.
The very day the servant-girl arrived at the set-
tlement she searched for work in company with
her companion, who happened to be “ known to
the police.” Suddenly the local constable pounced
upon the girl, and, without warning or advice,
arrested her. A viciously-ignorant magistrate
gave her three months, as a person without visible
means of support. When her sentence expired
she walked to a town 20 miles distant, and got a
situation in a public-house as waitress. But a
police officer, who happened to have been present
when she was sentenced, found her out, and forth-
with informed the publican of her imprisonment.
Ho also gave her 12 hours to leave the town. The
moneyless and homeless girl went the way of
frailty—cruel, unromautie ruin. Such are some
of the guardians of the peace.—D.

It is doubtful whether
cheap railway excursions,
from the country to the
metropolis, pay the N.S. W.
railway authorities in the
long run. Every excur-
sionist returns home laden
with goods booked as “pas-
senger’s luggage ” and
carried free, which, but for
the cheap fares, would have
been bought in some
country town and, conse-
quently, have paid freight.
The big Sydney shops alone
profit by the system, at
the expense of the small
country store-keepers.

The J ewish inspectors
of meat reject, as unfit for

per cent, of the calves and

loss to the meat-purveyors,
for the dirty, omnivorous,

Gentile never does ask any
questions. He takes his

The undertaker’s Journal, In Meaioriam,
recalls a society that once existed in Melbourne to
combat the silly custom of costly funerals.
Marcus Clarke, Andrew Semple, Jardine Smith,
and other Yorickers, were prominent members or
it—but they were all buried in more or less expen-
sive style.” The only way in which any real
reform can come about in this direction would be
for the State to become undertaker to the com-
munity. Uniformity and economy could then be
achieved.

The phrase “cleared out” {i.e., “at
the Customs ”) is but one of a host of nau-
tical expressiosn which have taken fast root
in colloquial English. Some of these are patent
enough; but how many people know that they
are “talking sailor” when they say “ threw me
over,” “hard-up,” “taken aback,” &c. ? Of
course it’s a question of drawing the line, but the
line keeps ever shifting, and it’s long odds that
even Justice Wiudeyer has used a certain familiar
metaphor connected with clearing a ship of water.

Of wondrous astral world and spirit land ;
Ye peep and peer until beneath your vision
Bi raphic figures rise and fade and fall;
Ye, boast ye lift the veil of life Elysian
And read the writings in the Judgment Hall.
Naught know we of your soarings all supernal,
Your worlds of wonder and your deeps divine;
We plumb no seas profound of Truth Eternal
With moonbeam-woven span-long sounding-line.

My Dear Moobabinda—
The theatrical carnival, at Sydney Association
Ground, last Thursday, was one of the liveliest
affairs ever set out under the bright blue sky,
despite the awful cigar-smoke—for, though the
real johnnies bought the fearsome carnival cigar
and gave it away, some of the purchasers con-
sumed them there and then with deadly effect.
Still, I liked the carnival, lock, stock, and barrel,
perhaps because, as an unprotected female, the
vendesses of smokes, matches and boutonnieres
left life unplucked. It was undoubtedly the men’s
day out, and I would like to pat ’em on the back
for the way they met the occasion. Not a man
but was beflowered, and every man’s hand was
always either going into or coming out of his
breeches’ pocket. The failure of the show, from
a dress-circle girl’s point of view, was certainly
the absence of a Brownlow tent. The massive
Wah ace, dressed as the wicked Henri, ladling out
mugs of “ Rosette ” milk, would have been turn-
ing money away in no time—but, as I said before,
it was the men’s day out.
Miss Nellie Stewart had the largest tent, spas-
modically decorated with potted shrubs and flags,
and when the fun got fast and furious you paid
one shilling merely for the privilege of entering.
This gave the beauteous prima-donna something
1 1« complexion of a monstrosity-show, but it
helped to keep the tent cool. Miss Stewart’s car-
nival frock consisted of a slim tlack skirt with
blouse bodice; of grey-ancl-white checked silk
trimmed with pale-blue ribbons and lines of black
lace edged with cream. The Nellie Stewart
bangle was in evidence, and it must now be the
proper caper to wear your watch on a long, slen-
der. old-fashioped gold chain going three times
round the neck, since Nellie wore her time-piece
in that way. A toque hat with bows of checked
ribbon, a crimson poppy and sprays of currants,
topped off the only Nellie’s braided locks, and she
wore a veil, of. course, as they all did. Gilded
youths and society maidens hung on her smile,
and I can assure you I heard a girl say to Nellie,
in tones of deepest tenderness : “I want a cup of
t»a, please, but oh, do give it to me yourself.”
Among all the unbridled adulation, a large,
hairy man, who was rushing violently to and fro
with crockery ware in Nellie’s tent, came quite as
a refreshing change. Surrounded by Nellie her-
self, Florence Young (in white pique and a pink
shirt, with a cash receptacle like a bookmaker’s
bag), Miss Deorwyn (in a pale brown gown,
trimmed with brown moire), and Nina Osborne,
the unemotional creature —I mean the hairy man-
scorned to recognise the delirious joy and ineffable
privilege of his position. As he swept up a bat-
talion of used dishes he said, loudly and im-
patiently, “ If they’d get out of my way, I could
work. I can’t work with women !!! ” It is quite
evident that this outspoken gentleman will never
give his countenance to the petticoat vote.
Mrs. Tapley’s tent was a great attraction.
Violet wore a crisp frock of heliotrope crinkled
with fandangoes of guipure lace and black
rosettes like full-stops all about. Her hat was
trimmed with black violets, and her smile went
on for ever. Hubby Tapley, who always looks
like Tommy Merton off the stage, hovered near
to protect his bride from the hard-held compli-
ments of the male multitude; and May Pollard
(in white and a pale-blue sash) and Mrs.
Lauri (in a grey check suit and a shirt front) lent
a hand in the Varley interest.
Kate Bishop (Mrs. Lohr), in black silk and
moire, had a society-position in the members’ tea-
room and did a roaring trade in light refresh-
ments. Her specialties were melty little cakes
called “kisses,’ of which (unlike the real article,
thank goodness) the supply wasn’t equal to the
demand. The handsome Mona Rathbone, of
tableau vivant fame, assisted Mrs. Lohr in dis-
pensing shilling cups of tea with the air of a
Melpomene.
There was an uncountable crowd in both the
stands, and it looked as if everybody was there.
A well-known Melbourne lady attracted most
attention by the acrobatic manner in which she
balanced a Paris hat shaped something like a
tablespoon-on-end at the extreme back of her
golden head ; but there was nothing else uncon-
sciously remarkable on view except a white-faced
girl shrouded in a bright blue veil which lent a
gruesome, corpse-like phosphorescence to her pallid
complexion.
The programme was almost entirely comic. It
is the correct thing to ask for attic salt only with
dishes of this sort, but I couldn’t help laughing at
a menagerie race with a spotty pig tearing along
in almost workmanlike manner with his curly tail
straight out and winning by lengths from a
wallaby, a oat, and a brace of roosters. The only
item I didn’t like was the ladies’ bicycle-race.
The contestants were properly gotten up in
knickerbockers and hose with Directoire coats and
little caps, and the pace was very merry all round,
but I can’t think such furious pedalling is healthy
for women. They all wheeled round the ring in
dashing style, but I saw one of them when the
glory was over, holding herself together with both
hands in the seclusion of the members’ stand,
with a face the color of cigar-ash.
To “sum up,” as the Judges do, the theatrical
carnival is just the sort of show Sydney stands in
need of. Plenty of music, plenty of people, lots
of harmless merriment, and no finnick. One
hears, of course, tea-table whispers of So-and-So’s
going home with Miss Longstockings, while his
wife “waited hours on the grand-stand for him,
my dear.” But, then, men have the happy knack
of getting into mischief anywhere, and I don’t
know why we should expect better things from a
theatrical carnival than we do from a church
choir.
There was Roman dressing in “ The Mounte-
banks,’’ which scarcely filled the bill at Sydney
Lyceum for the last six nights of the comic opera
season. I always think “The Mountebanks"
must have been written to give the coryphees a
chance to mend the Jacob’s ladders in their long
stockings, for many a pink limb points the way to
Heaven in this operetta, and the only ballet it
boasts always reminds me of a Bowdlerised version
of the temptation of St. Anthony. A semi-circle
of cowled monks in the background look on un-
moved while a scurry of village girls, in parlous
long skirts, wdiirl and jump like a Sunday-school
picnic with a bull-ant in its stockings, and I don’t
wonder the Brotherhood remain unimpressed, for
the dance isn’t half as thrilling as a line of assorted
washing on a moderately breezy day.
Miss Nellie Stewart’s Teresa seemed a nice sort
of girl in a Roman apron, but after a long and
welcome season of Nellie the first unreasoning
adoration wears off and you begin to take notice
that every picture in her stage gallery (with the
sole exception of Yum Yum) has long blonde hair.
In this era of peroxide of hydrogen one is apt to
look slantwise at the artless girl who shakes her
butter-color tresses in the breeze ; nevertheless,
Nellie (who is always wigged and cannot plead
the Bernhardtian excuse of playing in her own
hair) gives us a study in straw-color nearly every
time. I believe that lots of people at the fete ex-
pected to be given shilling cups of tea by an ador-
able Nellie emerging out of a whirl of sun-kissed
locks, and were left gasping for breath when a
demure personage, with light-brown hair braided
in tight plaits, handed them their potion instead.
Violet Varley, in Flora Graupner’s old part,
made a very dolly Ophelia in a Niagara of flaxen
hair, and was warmly welcomed by the audience.
She shared the evening’s fioralities with Miss
Stewart, whose tribute was in the form of a few
floral rings, which the lady doubtless took to
mean that she is only four rounds from the top of
the ladder of art. But I hope it wasn’t meant as
a foreshadowing of the gangway up which Nellie
(I hear) intends to trip, after the Melb. opera-
season is over, on her way back to have another
shot at British laurels. It isn’t pleasant to be
reminded that Nellie hasn’t come to stay.
As the rattling rantipole of the Tamoires,
Wallace Brownlow was a disappointment.
Whether it’s the fell effects of the Beautiful
Harbor (which Evangelist M'Neill blames for his
loss of vocal vigor—may the Beautiful Harbor be
for ever blessed !—and which may be the reason
why no soprano hails from its shores) or merely
that sustained effort has found his throaty baritone
out, I don’t pretend to know, but Mr. Brownlow
hasn’t enough voice to hail a ’bus with at time of
writing. But what a consistent and reliable per-
former Mr. Tapley is! Always nicely dressed
and painted, and going bang through his music
note for note, he must be a very treasure to the
management.
Ex-Ohief Justice Stephen 1 always regarded as
a social diplomat to the end of his finger-nails. A
forward and pushing woman aspiring to society
honors, and only on nodding terms with the
courteous old man, boldly tweaked him by the
sleeve one day at a very swell gathering and
begged him (although she had to recall both her
face and name to his memory) to introduce her to
Lady Blank. Now, the ex-Ohief Justice hadn’t
the remotest idea “who” the candidate was, and
yet, as she was apparently in the swim, he hardly
knew how to refuse. So, turning to Lady Blank,
he said : “ Allow me to present Mrs. Dash to you,
Lady Blank. I have not had the pleasure of
dancing with her, but that probably is my mis-
fortune.” On the spur of the moment, and for a
man of 91 (it only happened last year), I don’t
think this gentle hint that he didn’t back up his
introduction could well be improved upon. At
any rate, Lady Blank froze visibly.
The Australian agent, Mr. G. A. Falstedt,
sends me a sample of a new toilet wash yclept
“Amykos Aseptin,” which I can better recom-
mend to you in print than verbally, as I haven’t
the remotest idea how to pronounce it. A spoon-
ful of Amykos in a basin of water makes it delight-
fully sweet with a cinnamon scent that hangs
about one for a long time, and used as a mouth-
wash it really clears the throat and palate, besides
being a tooth and gum preserver and “ having a
destructive influence on all infusorise,” as the label
says. But, what is more to the point, “Amykos”
is all the label paints it to be, which is not the case
with all the gaudy and infallible toilet prepara-
tions that reach The Bulletin office.
Is the present N.S.W. Parliament hungrier than
former Parliaments ? If not, why is it that the
menu of the Parliamentary refreshment-room now
contains a new and significant nota bene. After
a statement at the head of the bill that soup with
joint or entree and sweets or cheese, also, tea comes
to “one-and-three” there is printed: “N.B.—
These charges apply to one helping only." To
what an apoplectic complexion must N.S.W.
legislators have already come I If a certain
statesman had found re-election there might have
been some well-understood reason for such a pro-
clamation, but, as it is, I suppose his knife and
fork have fallen on somebody.

, -A- small section of musical Sydney retired un-
impressed from a private recital given by August
W. Juncker at Paling’s on Monday afternoon,
when a new soprano, Miss Violet Ludlow, lifted
her voice to see whether Sydney would hail her as
a coming Nellie Stewart or not. Miss Ludlow, in
spite of being the prirna-donna of a band of New-
castle (N.S.W.) operatic amateurs, who make a
loud noise among the coals now and then, hasn’t
got quite enough voice to go ’Ome on, I am sorry
to say. When I first heard of Miss L. (who is
own cousin to Edward Lloyd, the English warbler,
by the way), I had hopes that, at last, a N.S.W.
soprano had risen in the east—but that pheno-
menon isn’t going to happen just yet. Miss
Ludlow sang Herr Juncker’s nevv song, “All in
All. The song is a little in a groove, perhaps,
with much sostenuto, d la “I Was Dreaming,"
but the words, by E. Long-hair Scott, are prettily
put, and the music wraps itself round them like
crape round a widower’s hat.
News of Mrs. Mellon and her spooks has, I
hear, been received with great interest in Mel-
bourne, where she was made famous by Prof.
Laurie’s lecture, satirised by Rev. G. Walters
as ‘Six Months of Psychical Research, by One
Who Wasn t There.” The Age got in first
with the exposure (despite Mr. David Syme’s
eerie predilections), but the Argus made a specialty
of it two days after with a Sydney Sunday Times
article, published from advance sheets.
Yours affectionately, Sappho Smith.
SPORTING NOTIONS.
A brief analysis of the Caulfield Cup chances in
last week s Bulletin was rational, in so far that it men-
tioned only nine candidates by name. Of these nine,
tillee Ruenalf, Steadfast and Moscow —did not start.
The others were Levon, Bruin, Capstan, Tarcoola, Paris
and Tellus, so the six mentioned runners actually included
the three placed horses. Wonderful tipping 1 Out of 26
unplaced o ms, the haughty prophet ignored 23? True,
the paragraph affirmed, firstly, that Bruin would beat
Devon if he could stay the course—secondly, that Ruenalf
ought to hold Paris safe, and Tarcoola should heat all the
heavy-weights-thirdly, that the writer would follow
Capstan if supported by the stable. But Bruin didn’t stay,
Ruenalf didn t run, and Capstan,was not “supported” by
the stable, or even by the prophet’s five shillings, for
that matter. Nothing in the par. was absolutely inexcus-
able, save the suggestion of Tarooofa beating top-weight
Paris. That was the one blot on the analysis. The fore-
going remarks are intended for gall-pure gall.
By the time this appears much will have been
written about the victory of Paris, for the second time, in
Caulfield Cup—“his marvellous performance under a
crushing weight,” &c. Paris is a good horse who can do
a certain thing particularly well. He has annexed eight
events during the last five years, handicaps all, or nearly
all, of them. One was a mile race, three were 11 furlongs,
and four were 12 furlongs in distance. A somewhat better
stayer than the common “flyer,” Paris can eorae with his
brilliant rush at the end of 1£ miles. He’s a specialist.
He has never fought out a finish with a first-class horse.
Note that runners-up to Carbine in weight-for-age and
handicap races were Abercorn, Loohiel, Melos, Dread-
naught, Megaphone, Highborn (to whom he gave
3s t. 101 b.), and The Admiral, some of these
playing second fiddle on more than one occasion.
The runners-up to Paris have been Doncaster,
Helene, Halo, Norbert, Candour, Yarron, Aureus and
Devon. Paris has shown that He can win up to 1J miles,
nor is he particular to a few pounds avoirdupois. In two
Melbourne Cups, a Metropolitan (2 miles), a Canterbury
Plate and a Sydney Cup this much “ messed-ahout ” little
horse has cut a by no means brilliant figure.
Previous to each of his Caulfield Cup wins,
Pans has run nowhere -in the Caulfield Stakes, a week
earlier. This year he was badly beaten in the Stakes
(9 furlongs) by two unbacked three-year-olds and Euroka
—at weight for age. Yet the V.A.T.O. didn’t call for any
explanation of the horse’s inconsistent performances.
There may have been an explanation, but why, in the
name of sporting decency, wasn’t it called for?
Devon and Bruin ran in the Caulfield Cup true
to their form in the Toorak Handicap. Bruin,
when giving 121 b. to Devon over a mile, had looked to be
winning until his heart, or his strength, suddenly failed.
Bruin, when meeting Devon at even weights over the
H miles seemed to be winning much more easily than
before, but he stopped as before and Devon beat him
again. It would seem that the second and third horses in
the Cup must have conspired together to make the
winner’s sudden improvement in “form” seem “un-
accountable.”
In next week’s issue The Bulletin tipster
will try to pick the winner of the Melbourne Cup, and
show cause why a lot of fancied horses should not win in
any case. This particular tip shall be a four-year-old,
unless more than two animals of that age go amiss in the
meantime.
Ruenalf was scratched for Caulfield Oup at the
tenth hour, for the alleged reason that his owner couldn’t
back him at a fair price, or “get any of the sweep
money.” The “cleverness” of this scratching policy
needs finding. A horse can’t remain at concert-pitch
week after week, anyway. If Ruenalf was a moral cer-
tainty for the Caulfield Cup, the owner might as well have
backed him to win a comfortable fortune at a price no
shorter than he will have to take for the Melbourne Cup,
if he intends to spin his horse for that. And, considering
how a “dead bird” for the Caulfield may be quite in-
capable of winning the longer race against a better field,
Mr. Kays is likely to find that he has thrown away a good
deal of Caulfield substance for a Flemington shadow. As
for sweep-money, it is to be hoped that the drawers of
Ruenalf for the Melbourne Cup will be situated in remote
spots, where they can’t be got at.
Indigration
may be the result of a variety of causes—debility
of the digestive tract, over mental work, nervous
prostration, excessive smoking, tea or spirit
drinking. At any rate, no matter what the cause,
the only treatment of any permanent benefit is a
restorative treatment; the remedy must possess
tonic, invigorating and strengthening properties.
This is not the case with any of the many purging
mixtures sold as dyspepsia panaceas, and this
is proved by their makers stating that the dose
must be increased until the desired effect is
attained. This is due to the nostrum being
purely a cathartic, and by continued use the
stomach, liver, and bowels become educated to the
action of the medicine and it gradually loses all
effect. Clements Tonic is quite distinct in its
action, it assists digestion, promotes the flow of
gastric and pancreatic fluids, increases the secre-
tion of bile and thus assists the bowels to throw off
the waste matter; it strengthens the nerves, forms
bone, muscle and nerve tissue, and increases the
appetite. Clements Tonie is a natural restorative
of a debilitated system. Read the case of Mr.
William W. Brown, Inspector W, and S. Board,
Cowrie-street, Newtown, who writes on Dec, 28th,
1892 : —For about two years I have been a severe
sufferer from biliousness and indigestion, with con-
stant attacks of dizziness; in fact, I have been at
times incapacitated from following my daily avoca-
tions as a Government Inspector. At times when
seized with dizziness I have had to sit down to
keep myself from falling. Hearing so much about
the nerve-strengthening qualities of Clements
Tonic, I resolved to give it a trial, which I have
done with the most beneficial results. I had only
taken two bottles when I,found myself thoroughly
cured. l am only too happy,to add my testimony
to the number already received.—Wishing you
every success j and a happy now year, I remain,
yours gratefully, William W. Brown, Inspector

Since the Vic. courts declared that the law

Martin ® our^e ) killed last week by a fall in
schooling,” had almost equal claims with Tom Com ■•an
to be the most popular man in Australia.” He was a
veteran at the game, with a solid reputation for honesty
and a more unassuming jockey never lived. Also, he was
the hero of about a dozen awful tumbles that were sup-
posed to he fatal at the time. His capacity for getting
bones broken was a standing joke among his mates. He
went to England and rode a winner over the sticks fot
the Chi resides. In South Australia he was almost in-
vincible fora time. In Victoria he had a special reputa-
tion for accepting dangerous mounts, whereas Corn-an
was associated with some of the “softest things” goinu
Luck was not kind to poor old Martin Bourke in Victoria
but he never failed to come to the fronc when he cot a
fmr chance, and two of his wins in the Flemington Grand
Nat. Steeplechase were “surprises.” In 1891 he drove
the plodding Crusoe home through the mud. This year
he dm the trick again with Daimio, the hunter. The
public don t like suprises, however, and so Bourke's name
was not adored in the land. He had not received a
great ovation" since 1888, when he won the G.N.
Steeple, on Eaglet, for the Millers, and completed their
double which Redleap (always ridden by Coxj had
begun. Bourke’s homely Irish countenance will be much
missed by the older school of racegoers.
Despite his claim as heavy-weight amateur of
Trinity College, Dublin,” surgeon O’Hara is not a boxing
scientist. He says: “Suddenly bringing my right fo.'t

nounce such a move absolutely barbarous,

Melb. Cup has not ye.t been won by a horse
weighted at 6st. 81bs. Highborn was put down by
Carbine, when he represented N.S.W., the winner con-
ceding him 631bs. Then Honda carried the unlucky
weight into second place behind Glenloth. Now v e have
Chestermao to represent N.S.W. with a similar impost,
or4lbs. less than his sire won with in 1877. What's the
odds ?

The Caulfield Cup rapidly increases in impor-
tance, challenging the Melb. Cup, which is stationary, or
retrograde. The night before the Caulfield battle, just
over, was very nearly as lively in Bourke-st. as a Cup eve.

The smug advertising tipster who, a we-ek before

and three horses as likely to get places, was unfortunate
enough not to have a starter in the whole lot. Yet the

In 92, Paris won the Caulfield Cup, carrying
Bst. 81b. in 2.38 J. On Saturday, when he won it a''ai.i,
he cut off the quarter second with his 9st. 41b. up.

Devon’s meritorious performances at Caulfield

In picking an eleven to meet the Englisl mien
the N.S.W. Selection Committee has a tough task ahead.
N.S. Wales cricket should not be allowed to suffer in the
interests of sentiment. All things equal, the old hand
should obme before the colt; hut when it comes to
choosing between the old hand with tons of experience
and an ounce of cricket, and the youngster with tons
of cricket and ounce of experience, cricket should have
the call. Bannerman, Sid. Gregory and Moses have this
season, so far, shown nothing to justify their inclusion in
the team ; and, as regards the last named, the report that
he does not intend to play this season in first-class cricket
comes prematurely, as it has yet to he shown that he is
worthy of a place. The cry is usually raised that Banner-
man and Gregory should be played for their fielding
alone, but there are colts now playing who can field as
well as either of them when at their best. Turner is
bowling well, but is very much off in his baiting.
Although one department of the game usually suffers at
the expense of the other, the Bulletin always thought
“ Charley ” was going to prove the exception to the rule.
* • * ♦
The Blackham-Tooher quarrel has now been
amicably settled. Blackham’s remarks should have been
taken all along in a Pickwickian sense. The whole
trouble was assiduously fanned by a couple of Jonhny-
come-latelyg, people who were in the nursery when
the great wicket-keeper was fighting for Australian
cricket.
* * * *
Richardson, whom Stoddart is bringing out, is
reckoned England’s deadly bowler. The strong point
about his trundling is its remarkable effectiveness on a
hard wicket—a rare accomplishment for a bowler, and
bad news for our batsmen.
* » » *
S. Australia will put a strong eleven in the field
against Stoddart’s team, who open in Adelaide first
week in Nov. The backbone of S.A. will be G. Giffen,
Lyons, Darling, Reedman, A. H. and F. Jarvis, and Jones,
a very strong batting and howling seven. Walter Gitfen
will be omitted this time on his merits.
Fight-merchants do better than the actual
sloggers in the States. Griffo and M'Auliffe took about
£3lO each, as against £3IOO gathered in by the promoters.
Griffo’s stock has gone up higher in the States
than if the M'Auliffe decision had been in his favor,
and, at latest, he was rushed with offers of engagements.
Offers were thrown out for a finish go with M'Auliffe, and
a limited bout with Billy Plimmer, the little fellow who
bested Dixon. If the little Sydney tough keeps level-
headed—which it is a million to one he won’t—he should
now put together a competence at short notice.
♦
Prior to his defeat by Fitzsimmons, Creedon
claimed to have fought 111 times, with 109 wins and 2
draws. One of these was with Costello, whom he after-
wards beat.
* * • ♦
At latest, the Americans were trying to make
an actor of Griffo. The Bulletin suggests a piece—“ One
Hundred and Ten Nights in a Bar-room."
* * * •
A football match for a money-stake has been
played at Ballarat. Melb. papers call on the V.F.A to
prevent sueh “gambling contests." The policy of at-
tempting to pull up professionalism by the roots is
questionable. Cricket is an absolutely spotless game
beside football, and yet it admits professionals. Boxing
would be a tired art without the paid pug. Even sprint-
ing, with all its vices, gets something good from the pro.
What is wanted in professional football is not an evaded
(and evasive) “prohibition," but a “licensed” system.
Not rabid teetotalism, but temperance.

Frank Toms leaves Adelaide P. 0., at noon, on
Nov. 12, to break the cycling record between that city
and Melbourne. Snell lately did the journey in 3 days
6h. 15m. 15 secs.
* ♦ * ♦
Walter S. Kerr (amateur), Australia’s champion
bicyclist, ;was born at Doable Bay, Sydney, in ’7l, and is,
consequently, 23 years old. He stands sft. 6in. in height,
and in racing costume weighs 9st. He has been six years
on the track, and has held the championship for four
years. He also holds ail Australian records from one mile
to ten. Whence such a scrap of a man draws all his mar-
vellous go is a mystery. Perhaps, like the Yankee cyclist,
Ziminennann, he has an abnormally-large heart.

Woman’s Enfranchisement.
The Leaders in office all over the world, and
especially in this continent, are proposing that
woman, or at least some of her, should have the
suffrage extended to her. Very well then. This
action is partly the inevitable answer that rnust be
made to the voice ®f the people, especially as
election times are appppaching, and partly an
attempt to bolster up the iniquitous system of
plural voting which has received such a death blow
from the recent accession of workers’ representa-
tives to Australian Parliaments. _ Whether or not
the departure will prove productive of good or ill,
whether the enfranchised woman will neglect her
house duties and, vote for the ornamental candi-
date with the curly golden beard to the exclusion
of the rugged Hampden, or the patriot with odd
eyes, is a matter that rests in the womb of the
future. Woman’s political enfranchisement by
the march of progress may be an unmixed blessing
or an undoubted curse. Woman's disenfranchise-
ment from disease by the sterling virtues of Warner’s
Safe Cure can be nothing but a heaven-sent
boon. The great number of complaints from
which our mothers, the past builders of the world,
and our wives and sisters, who are to be the
mothers of the next generation, suffer, vanish
before ilui conquering remedies of H. H. Warner
& Co. Muscular weakness, tumors, abscesses and
all the nameless ills known generally as female
o miplaints, are evidences of blood corruption,
caused by the duties of maternity, or the errors of
dress, diet, and habits. It is the special duty of
the kidneys to keep the blood pure and capable of
doing its work, and when this function is impaired
only Warner’s Safe Cure can restore it. Patients
may reasonably expect great results from the use
of one or two bottles, but four or six bottles are
necessary, in some cases to produce permanent
results. But the results are so thorough that not
one of the thousands of Australian women thus
restored to the enjoyment of health would regret
the cost of even ten times the quantity mentioned
of the famous Safe Cure were such a quantity
necessary.

“ When the flag was at last lowered, a dull thud
nroclaimed that they were off.” This is not a report of a
hanging. It is part of Sydney Sunday Times’ description
of Caulfield Cup race.

Writes “ Victor For the second year in
succession “Carbine” Wallace seems to have fairly
thrown away the Caulfield Cup. Titan’s after-running
shows that the race would have been a good thing for him
last vear despite the penalty he incurred for winning
T mrak Handicap. This year, by trusting to Taupe
instead of Gaillardia, an equally egregious blunder has
been made.
Gaillardia (a stayer) would have finished far in
front of the non-staying Bruin, who managed, though
badly ridden, to struggle into third place. The form
shown by her in last season’s Newmarket Handicap run-
ning proves this. Let Bulletin readers keep their eyes
on the mare during Flemington meeting, where she is
heavily engaged and should account for one or more of
the prizes.
The Captain’s owner tried in vain to secure a
big bet about his horse, and, failing in this, he did not
send him across the Border. Hik horse will be to the fore
lit Xmas time. The Summer Cup will about suit him.
“No consultation-money to be had,” was the
ostensible reason for Ruenalf not running in the Caulfield
0 ip but all along it has been here predicted that the Cup
will be his journey. He will, moreover, very nearly win.
Tim Swiveller ran a good horse, and will beat
all the Caulfield Cup representatives in the Melb. event.
A few-more stfong gallops will do him no end of good.
Malachite’s running in the Maiden Plate
further enhances Cobbity’s form, for the latter can run
rings round him at home.
Between Moorite and Oobbity ’twill be found
the V.R.C. Derby will lie—the former for choice.
Had it nob been for Jack Fielder’s determined
finish on Paris, the other “ fielders ’’ would have had a
“ skinner ” over Devon, who weuldhave won with amore
experienced jockey up.
Lady Trenton sorely disappointed her multi-
tudinous backers. With a little weight off her back, she
will be very handy at the end of the year. Tattersali s
Cup?
The excellence of the Chester blood was again
exemplified by the wins of Malachite and Escapade (son
and daughter) and Blue Cap, a grandson, of that illustrious
sire.
Loyalty has improved to a great extent since he
has been at Flemington, and he will run very forward in
the Cup ; hut he will find Tridentate, Ruenalf and Ronda
hard nuts to crack.
The starting-machine was tried with great
success in the Nursery and Windsor Handicaps, and ’tis
to be hoped that ’twill be adopted for all races in future.
There was a full 15 minutes’ delay in the start for Caulfield
Cup, and the man with the flag was hooted when he
returned to the enclosure.
Gale, by the imported Nautilus, will run a great
colt in the Maribyrnong Plate, and will much trouble
the much-vaunted Challenger. In fact, at starting prices
he will prove a better investment than “Westralia
Wilson’s colt.
The Syndicate pulled back most of their
Chesterman losses over Escapade, who started at a nice
price for Windsor Handieap. Her rider, Luckman, really
seems to be the “lucky” man, or boy, of the season,
and, as he has good hands and head, he should make a
jock, far above the “spur and whalebone" brigade.

A Ballarat cabman, to win a 10s. bet, climbed
to the top of the flagpole on the Town Hall tower, and
when a policeman, who had chased him to the roof,
reached the pole, “cabby was standing in a stooping
position on the apex, hanging on with his hands and
feet, waiting for the wind to subside before assuming an
erect attitude. He remained so for three minutes, and
then yielded to the solicitations of the officer and slid
down.” He is to be prosecuted for “ being illegally on
the premises.” That is like prosecuting the man who
enters the lion's cage for trespass.

Che satisfactory increases for Victoria and Tasmania have
already been noted in this column—likewise the junior
position of Westralia’s product in proportion to the
journalism on the subject,
N.S.W. gold-yield has a pleasant place in these
returns, as shown hereunder. M.L. and Queensland are
in a different position re mint statistics, a portion only of
their sold being mnt -d in Australia. Here are the nine
months figures, as anove, increased by one-third to show
t ie probable weight that will be produced for coinage in
94—and by the side thereof the '93 yield is quoted;—

These figures afford a basis for a preliminary
estimate of the probable total yield for ’94. The Queens-
land and Maoriland figures, however, must be got else-
where, and even the Westralian figures should, perhaps
have a higher percentage added than in previous quarters,
tor better or worse, th-n, here is the estimate for ’94 ;

this method of comparison, however, puts '94 in a rather
advantageous light, as the ’54 yield was small as things
went then: 3,238,3440 z. (for ’56) is Australia’s record.
I erhaps the best comparison after all for ’94 is with the
previous years, thus;—

i “i Australasian estimate is realised, we will again take
the lead, the United States coming second, Africa third
and Russia fourth.
These international comparisons must be made
on the basis of fine gold. U.S. A. estimates are alwaj-s
given in fine gold. A deduction of 8 per cent, has to be
made from the Australasian yield, and the Randt gold
must only he reckoned at £3 12s. per ounce. In other

The currency of China proves that it is the
devil’s own country. The unprinciples of a prostituted
bi-metallism reign like the worst breed of nightmare. In
the first place, cash or li is cast from an alloy of copper,
iron and tin. One thousand of these should go to the
tael, but they don’t. The number was, perhaps, 1700 last
week, and will be, perhaps, 1600 next week. A tael is a
quantity of silver about the size of a lump of chalk. A
tael in Shanghai is by no means a tael in Haikwan. But
a tael in Shanghai can with reasonable uncertainty be
said to be 1-3937 Mexican dollars. One hundred Haikwan
taels equal 111-40 Shanghai taels = 101‘75 Amoy taels =
106-40 Uhefoo taels=lo4--l6 VVuhu taels=llo Foochow
taels = 113 - 76 Hoihow taels, &c., &o. If you are a China-
man you can enjoy this. But the worst remains to be
told. These taels are either measured in shoes (ingots) of
silver or in a miscellaneous collection of dollars of varying
weight, thus: —
Japanese Trade Doilar=42o grains troy.
Japanese Yen =416 ~ ~
Hongkong Dollar =416 ~ ,’
Mexican do. =4l6£ ~ ~’
Carolus =414 „ „
On top of all this you have to pile the final complication
that each district has its conventional discount and pre-
mium. In some places you have to give so much silver
over the nominal amount, otherwheres you get a discount
you didn’t expect.
The queerest thing in currency is a dollar that
lias gone the rounds of China. Every merchant who gets
hold of the coin puts his chop , shro/mark, or monogram
on it, with a brass stamp and a hammer. The conse-
quence is chaos.
* » * *
The silver exports from London to the East
were about normal in the first eight months of '94, if we
reckon the gross amount at the sterling value. There is,
of course, an enormous advantage to this year over last)
if we reckon the weight shipped. The following are the
figures for eight months ;
1893. 1894.
, India .. .. £4,939,452 £3,705,715
China .. 834,013 2,040,873
Straits .. 960,340 877,652
£6,733,805 £6,624,240
It will be seen that China’s needs have been hugely
increased this year, almost atoning for the brake that has
been put on Indian importation by the cesahtym of
coinage.

Dear Bulletin, —Your reference to the bill re-
forming the law re mortgages, introduced by J. M. Cross,
in Q. Assembly, recalls to me an idea, suggested by a per-
sonal knowledge of the subject, that a further alteration
might well be made in the interest of laborers employed
on mortgaged property, on agricultural land in particular.
In this country the farmer is dependent solely on the pro-
ceeds of his harvest for the means to pay the men whom
he has to prepare the ground for the crop, to
sow and to reap it. The men know this, and are content
to wait for their wages until the crop is sold. In marry
cases they work for nearly a year clearing, gruhbinv
ploughing, &c.—getting little besides their tucker-in the
expectation of being paid in full when the product of
tneir toil has been disposed of.
Now, take the case of a farmer whose land is
under mortgage. He owes money to his storekeeper, his
laborers and others, all waiting for harvest-time. Before
that arrives, however, the mortgagee takes possession,
sells him off, and, as is usually the case, the amount
realised is scarcely sufficient to repay the mortgage debt,
t here is then no money left to pay the wages of the men
"i , 08 ® *' ol ‘ nas actually improved and made more market-
able the security, and the mortgagee gets the benefit of this
increased value for nothing! The above is not a supposi-
tion, as I know of many instances where the wiong has
been done. It may be said that the laborer has a remedy
against his employer; but it is a useless one. Where is the
good of obtaining a judgment when one cannot get the
rruits o i ! The employers’ personal property is all
under bill-of-sale or stock mortgage, and at the
least sign of danger the holders of these instruments
exercise their legal rights and sell for what they
can get The Bankruptcy Act makes a preferential
debt of laborers wages, not exceeding £5O, for ser-
yices rendered to the bankrupt during six montl s
before the date of the bankruptcy order ; but where is
thejse of proving a debt when the estate is worth
nothcvg owing to the “ secured ” creditors having pounced
on all the assets? Consequently, the one who has been
producing the means to pay the interest due to the mort-
gagee of i,he land, and who has also been increasing th ;
value of the security upon which the principal was
advanced, js compelled to whistle for his waves. The
lienee or hmder of a, crop lien, is compelled, in the event
of his taking possession of the crop, to pay any rent due
to the landlord by the tenant whose crop is seized, or the
interest due to the mortgagee if the land is mort>'av e d.
Truly, property has some “sacred ” rights !
j mortgagee* on taking possession, were
compelled to pay ;fce wages ,->f the men who had been
employed on the land for, Say, *2 months prior to the
date of seizure, a great injustice to a class too little able
to protect themselves would he prevented. Surely this is
a matter that is deserving of attention from those of onr
legislators who believe that “Property” has had in the
past too much protection, and flesh and blood too little.
—D.D.k.

Geologist Jack, of Queensland, has gone West
to inspect the artesian strata. He enjoys this purely
scientific visit as a break from his ordinary duties which
he quaintly says are popularly expected to be those of “ a
quasi mining-tipster.” The public demand too much of
geologists, and are ever ready to assail them when pay.
able results are obtained from any ground ori"inaliy
evoking unfavourable reports from the scientist He
cannot predict, but merely deduces. He endorses the
opinion of the miner who says, “ Where it is-there it is!”

A colossal pile awaits the man who locates the
big cement deposit which is the source of the great
Noitheru alluvial gold-lead (Park's, N.S.W.). Twenty
per cent, of the “ wash ” in this lead is cement, and this
cement averages as much gold as the dirt, and has, there-
fore, to be crushed. The cement deposit is believed to be
within a mile or two of the lead. Here is a chance for the
diamond drill.

Cabled that Jabez Balfour, the bnildinv-soci tv
swindler, whom the English Govt, has been making
tremendous efforts (above board) to capture, and gigantic
struggles ( sub-rosd) to ke -p at large, is weary of the"farce
and has escaped for good and all. Cabled also that he
hasnt escaped and isn’t going to. If Balfour will only
make up his mind finally, and come as far as Melbourne
he will be perfectly safe, for in pious and influential
circles there they are all tarred with the same brush.

Br PRICE WARUNG.
Premier Reid is evidently thinking about
taking off the N.S.W. sugar-duty. This means
that the N.S.W. sugar-industry, which supports,
directly and indirectly, a good many thousand
workers and their families, must close up, or else
that wages must come down to the Kanaka
rates paid in Queensland. Up North now the
white cane-cutter; working;by contract, can, if he
toils from sunrise to sunset, earn about 3s. a day,
out of which he has to find his own food. This is
what must come in N.S. Wales if Reid acts up to
his convictions. And if he doesn’t act up to his
convictions, for what earthly purpose is he in office
as a 1 reetrade Premier ?
When John Downer, Q.C., was S.A.
Premier recently, his Govt, got notice from the
official draftsman that there was a flaw in the
rules made by the Supreme Court Judges under
u 6 P ro * J ; l * ;e Act of ’92. No notice was taken of
the warning, but after the Cabinet resigned, John
Downer, Q.C., as solicitor in the Price Maurice
estate, brought arguments to bear on the Supreme
Court which resulted in the rules being pro-
nounced ultra vires. During the two years, about
XoOOO was collected in fefes, and the Kingston
Govt, recently brought in a Bill to validate the
rules, but this _ has been bitterly contested by
Downer Q.C., in his capacity as leader of the
Opposition, with the result that its retrospective
powers have been excised. It is only fair to Downer
| to say that he solemnly avers that his Attorney-
General (Homburg) did not show him the com-
munication sent in by the draftsman in October of
last year; but the coincidence is a somewhat awk-
ward one for the Q.C.
Miss M. Fleming, late of Melb. Reform
Club Hotel, announces that she has taken the
Hotel Metropolis in Bourke-street, one of the
handsomest hotels in the Southern city.
The Esplanade Hotel, at St. Kilda, still
retains its place as one of the few elegant and
fashionable Victorian hotels. In point of situa-
tion it is positively unrivalled, commanding the
best possible view of Hobson’s Bay and Port
Phillip. Trams pass the door every ten minutes,
and the city may easily be reached within a
quarter of an hour. Mr. ;ff. Jacoby is still the
popular host of this favorite establishment.
Sydney Wool Sales.
M'Burnev, Wallis & Co. report: —At the sales in the
early part of this week, competition for good greasy wool
was slightly better than at last auctions, although no
actual improvement in prices may be quoted. Scoured
wool is, if any alteration, slightly under opening rates. I
The outlook of the m irket is not encouraging, and we see !
no reason for anticipating much increase in prices. The
wool lo hand so far shows increased weight as compared
with last season, which was also a heavier year than its
predecessor. We, would again warn owners against
hampering the sale of their wool by placing excessive
reserves upon it. The judgment of his auctioneer, who
has all descriptions of wool daily under his notice, must i
be the best guide a producer can have. To-day we are
offering an attractive catalogue.
Sydney, Oct. 19, 1891.
A FEW FACTS WORTH NOTINU.
During the past five years The City Mutual
Life Assurance Society has made greater pro-
portionate strides than any other Life office
doing business in Australia. It alone has
shewn a continuous increase in the volume of
new business transacted--always the test of
the popularity of an institution. At the
beginning of 1889 its funds barely totalled
£40,000, now the annual income and invested
funds exceed £160,000 stg. This increasing
popularity has been earned solely on its own
claims to public favor—never on the demerits,
manufactured or otherwise--of any other
institution. Now and again the City Mutual
has had to complain of unfair rivalry and
has lately been reluctantly compelled to
drop a hint that this sort of nonsense had
better stop once and for ever.
But at the same time it invites criticism--
the fullest inquiry and the freest critioism--
of its figures. The Sydney Bulletin--
nothing if not plainspoken--recently com-
mented om the somewhat heavy expense sheet
last year. Every assistance was thereupon
accorded the Bulletin to compare the expenses
of other first-class offices at a similar
age and to note the volume of new business
transacted by the City Mutual as compared
with that of every other Australian Life
Office. The Bulletin, searching for truth
and finding it, puts the case of the City
Mutual fairly before the assuiing public in
its issue of the 29th ult.
The Balance Sheets and Actuarial Reports
of this Society--the people's office--are
always open for the perusal and study of
everybody--intending assurer or otherwise--
and it may be of interest to learn in con-
nection therewith that the City Mutual is
the only office in Australia which periodi-
cally submits its figures to the examination
of a professional actuary in no way con-
nected with the Society.

Max O’Rell on Australia .
Great fleas have little fleas upon their backs to
bite ’em ; and Australia, for her sins, has Max
O’Rell. Max is, indeed, a literary flea, hopping
round the world with Gallic agility, and generally
drawing blood wherever he goes. The
not a disagreeable one. To travel from country
to country with open eyes and ears stretched to
catch club gossip and society doubles-entendres;
to spy out the nakedness of your hosts in their
unguarded moments as an usher spies behind the
dormitory door, exulting over the rod he has in
pickle (though it cannot be too often affirmed that
Max was never an usher, always a Professor);
and then to dish up your impressions with
sauce piquante in a nice little book which
your victims buy while howling—is not this
a delightful jin-de-sihde occupation ? But not
everybody has Max’s talent to live on the
enemy, and to put them so dexterously in the
position of Byron’s stricken eagle. It is no dis-
praise to say that Max borrows an epigram here
ft nd steals a chestnut there, and that his books
are merely an olla-podrida of unacknowledged
thieveries. Eor he still has the merit of showing
now it is done, and no one grumbles because
Oolumbus did not create America, as well as dis-
cover it. Granted that Max is but a concocter of
an exhausted diner frequently prefers
a French cook’s rechauffe to the most splendid
jirloin; and Max O’Rell hashes and combines
and garnishes with all the deftness of a Soyer.
One’s first impression about “John Bull and
Jo.” is that it is very inaccurate and very
Jull. A second impression is that it is rather
nore inaccurate and a little duller. But that is
iot Max’s fault. The diary detail appears dreary
oecause it is taken from our own diary ; the jokes
je em cheap and ohestnutty because they are our
jwn old jokes. Only familiarity breeds contempt
for Max’s wit. Consider what a sensation will be
jaused in England by the story about the woman
jvho wouldn't take a lift on the train because she
was in a hurry ! How the new gloomounsts will
writhe in impotent jealousy of the man who can
sparkle like that I And when Max goes on to say
that when he saw an Australian train passing he
•nvoluntarily lifted his hat, is it possible to doubt
that old-world readers will roll on the ground in
scstasy ? After all, nothing could be fairer. Aus-
tr Bans have laughed at John Bull for hanging
“Thou God seest me!” in his bedroom; they
have laughed at friend Macdonald for debiting
his son with holiday ham-and-eggs; why should
not Macdonald and Bull, in turn, enjoy them-
selves at the expense of Australian railways?
Why not, indeed ?
• * *
If one can divest one’s-self of Australian pre-
judices, and attack “John Bull and Co.” with a
clean memory and a right spirit, there is a good
deal to smile over and a little to think over It is
abundantly evident, indeed, that Max O Rell hf.i
little critical insight. He has never been able to
separate wheat from chaff in all the stories which
have been told him, .and the views which he
voices are simply those of the people he has mixed
with _ unsifted, unanalysed, uncorroborated.
1 has his book cannot be taken seriously.
It is full of half - truths which leave a
wholly wrong impression; of facts set forth
without the reservations and conditions
which alter their character completely; of dis-
torted glimpses, disproportionate estimates, and
misunderstood meanings. The saddest mistake of
all is the portrait of Parkcs, whose mane has been
clipped and combed by a Delilah-like artist until
all his glory has departed. The next saddest
thing is the hoax played on Max by a Sydney
clubman, “one of the foremost merchants of the
town,” who told Max he couldn’t go to the lec-
tures because he was drunk every evening from
seven o’clock. “ Drunkenness of that description
is so repulsive to me that I forthwith left the
dining-rqom,” says the shocked Max.
# * *
Unluckily, Max took the joke as a bit of typical
reality, and he cannonades the drink-curse
throughout a whole chapter—invariably citing
extreme cases as examples of national character.
What logical reputation would a traveller preserve
in France who held up a Parisian absinthe-wreck
as showing the spiritual degradation of the French
nation? Undoubtedly too much alcohol is con-
sumed in Australia, and the daily practice of
drinkingspiritsis viciousand unhealthy. Drunken-
ness is our worst legacy from our Teutonic
ancestors. But one questions whether its results
are shown to worse advantage in Australia than
in England, for example. And Max O’Rell
omitted to note the undoubted temperance of
native Australians, who as a class very rarely
drink to excess. Nor does it help to say that—
It is not uncommon in Australia to see a young man
arrive in a town, hand over a cheque for fifty or sixty
pounds to the keeper of some hotel, saying to him, “Let
me have as much drink as I want. When I have drunk
my cheque, let me know, and I will go home.”
That pre-historio knocker-down of cheques is
deader than Captain Cook—killed by “depression”
and the march of civilisation. And he never was
a young man, anyhow.
Away from the Curse, Max opines to better
advantage. He ridicules with justice the cant
and snobbery prevailing among the “ right-think-
ing” classes of Australia, and his parody on Sum-
mary Smith’s prayer that God would restore con-
fidence in the reconstructed banks is as apt as it
is eloquent. He has found time, too, to notice
that “missionary boys” join the faults of their
old state with the vices of their new religion. Of
the Zulus, for instance
In the natural state, the Zulus are honest and their
women are virtuous. When they have gone through the
apprenticeship of civilisation in the missions, the womens
virtue often loses much of its rigidity, and the men lie
and cheat like “Christians” of the deepest dye. The
Zulus are virtuous and honest by instinct , and it is diffi-
cult to see how their childlike souls can be improved by a
theorv which, after all, may be summed up in these few
words • “ Do not sin, but if you sin, make yourself easy,
you have only to believe and all your sins will be blotted
out ” “ Let us sin, then,” say the converted Zulus, too
often ; “ the more we sin, the more will be forgiven us.
• * *
So on the whole, Max is a disappointment. He
is getting successful and lazy now, and will not
take pains to sharpen up his bright sayings ; nor
does he trouble to make sure of-their justice being
content to father any haphazard opinion that he
comes across. His mistakes are no matter; but
when one thinks of the splendid field of Australian
humour yet unreaped by the book-makers, it is a
grievance that he should not glean a better harvest,
considering his repute. But, after all. Max
O’Rell is rather an author of reputation than ot
repute. “ That makes a difference, don tit ?
Dear Bulletin, —How is this for a tight
place? Many years ago I deserted from an Eng-
lish ship on which I was an apprentice, and shipped
in the little topsail schooner Hesperus, of Auck-
land, bound to Tahiti. On a dark night wo ran
into a coral reef 20 miles from Papeete ; the vessel
was entirely broken up in the surf, and out of a
crew of seven only the mate (who, by the way,
was a baronet) and myself were saved. We lay
on the beach all night, unable to walk, scratched
and torn by the jagged coral, and were found next
morning at daylight by some native women
bathers. They ran off, but soon returned accom-
panied by the inhabitants of the whole village,
and, after a consultation, three or four of the young
men were sent away and came back with bundles
of green leaves, which were distributed to the
others and which they all immediately began to
chew, sitting in a circle meanwhile around us.
Each mouthful after mastication was placed in
front of the chevver, and all the time this was
going on I thought the fodder was to be used as
stuffing, and that we were to be seasoned and
eaten. Of course I was mistaken, but I shall
never forget the terrible quarter of an hour spent
in watching the preparation of the condiment
that was to make my baked clay taste nice. They
spread the stuff they had prepared on our outs
and bruises, and so effectual was it that we could
actually feel the pain being drawn from us- in
great throbs. I am a canvasser now, and if I
could get some of that ointment I would patent a
“ heal-all ” salve that would make my fortune. —

“ T hold the Crown of Germany from God
alone, and it is my conviction that I am guided by
the Almighty in all my actions.”— William, of
Yarrnany.
Which shows it takes a head that’s level
To know your God now from your Devil.
AND THIS IS ONE OF THEM.
There are some truths that ought to be blown
through a million speaking trumpets every hour;
that ought to be printed in big type on the front
page of every newspaper ; that ought to be painted
on every signboard at the crossroads ; that ought
to be taught in every school. And this is one of
them : There is no such thing on earth as a tonic
medicine.
People talk of “tonics” and doctors talk of
y tonics.” Pshaw ! When a country is discovered
in which no food stuffs are ever raised orimported,
and in which the men, women, and children are
all well and hearty, we may conclude they subsist
on some sort of “tonic.” The mischief this
delusion about tonics has done is beyond calcula-
tion. It leads the sick to lean on broken reeds,
to expect relief from a source from whicli it is
simply impossible that relief can come, to waste
money in buying “tonics,” and precious time in
waiting for these alleged “ tonics ” to work
miracles.
Mr. Thomas Foster, of 15, Chatham Place,
Adelaide Street. Hull, in an account of a recent
illness, says, among other things, this: “ I then
tried stomach tonics, but they did me no good.”
Suppose we have his whole story, which is short,
and make our comment on it afterwards. He says:
“ Up to the month of June, 1891, I was strong and
healthy. At that time I fell into a low, weak
condition. I felt languid and heavy, and was
always tired. I had a foul taste in the mouth,
and a dreadful pain in the chest and sides after
eating, whilst my stomach was like a burning fire.
I was much troubled with wind, which seemed to
roll all over me, and I had a constant belching and
rising in my throat. I was in agony day and
night, and for hours I walked about the room
rubbing my chest in the effort to obtain relief.
I lost a deal of sleep, and felt worse tired in the
morning than when I went to bed. Gradually I
became weaker and weaker until I had hard work
to follow my employment, for I was in misery all
the time.
“ I went to a doctor, who sounded me and gave
me medicines, but I got no relief, and after taking
his tnedieines for a month, I left off going to him.
I then tried stomach tonics and other medicines but
nothing did me any good. In this state I con-
tinued week after week, growing more feeble all
the while. I felt that if I did not soon find a
remedy I should be done for altogether.
“In October, 1891, a book was left at my house
telling of a medicine called Mother Seigel’s Cura-
tive Syrup, and describing a case like mine that
had been cured by it. As I had often heard this
medicine well spoken of, I made up my mind to
try it, and got a bottle from Mr. Cousins, in
Anlaby Road. After I had taken two doses, I felt
grateful relief, and before I had quite finished the
bottle I was completely cured, and have since been
in the best of health.
“ I thank God that this medicine was ever made
known to me. Otherwise I should have been in my
grave before now. I will answer anyone who may
write concerning the facts here set forth. Yours
truly (Signed), Thomas Foster, 15, Chatham Place,
Adelaide Street, Hull, March 24th, 1892.”
Now let us see. The symptoms of Mr. Foster’s
complaint are easily recognisable. He suffered
from indigestion and dyspepsia. The medicines
administered by his physician or purchased by
himself proved useless because they were not
addressed to the disease with which he was actually
afflicted, but possibly to one or more of its symp-
toms. To abolish any existing evil it is always
Causes we must work at —never mere conse-
quences.
- The “ stomach tonics ” which Mr. Foster hoped
might relieve him may have done so for a moment
on precisely the same principle that a sharp
application of whip and spur wakes up a tired
horse, not by giving him strength, but by rousing
his reserved nervous force, with a deeper reaction
to follow. That’s how it ever was and will be.
Mother Seigel’s Curative Syrup restored this
gentleman to real and genuine health by cleansing
his system of the poison of disease, by removing
the obstacles and enabling the stomach to retain
and digest food. A very simple thing, yet how
hard to accomplish, oh ! my masters.
The remedy does it, however, as is testified by
a host of witnesses all over the world —witnesses
who say more in praise of its merits than you
would have time to read.
The case of the Melb. man who disem-
bowelled himself with a razor after stealing a col-
lection of choice classics from a book-shop, should
be a handy illustration to the arguers against
classical education. Cato, of course, was his
exemplar. But there is no record that Cato
prigged papyri in the Via Sacra.
S.M. Herald asks if the cry of “Australia
for Australians ” be anything but an empty sound,
why is it that we beg in England and Ireland
for the support of our churches. First, who are
they who raise the cry ? and second, who are they
who so beg? The unification of these two parties
is wildly impossible.
Some of the matrons of up-country hos*
pitals are “hard-cases.” Lately, in a N.S.W"
wayback town, where no wardsman is employed’
one of the patients, a wild, agricultural Irishman’
refused to obey the matron’s orders, whereupon
she promptly engaged him in a wrestling-match,
which resulted in a bad defeat for the Irishman.
Score—three falls to nothing.
A Kumara (M.L.) paper tells a double fat-
pig yarn about two of the fattest Berkshire one-
year-olds ever killed. They were so fat that they
had long since ceased eating their food standing,
and adipose tissue had grown over their eyes,
making them stone-blind. When hung up they
looked more like square boxes than pigs.
“A Golden Shanty,” by Bulletin writers,
is one of the most striking products of nascent
Australian literature. Its contents are gems of
native lustre, glowing with no borrowed brilliancy.
Their breezy humour, their weird pathos, spring
alike from Southern soil, under a Southern sky,
and their promise is sui generis, unique and
unapproachable. The second edition now ready ;

The Argus creed for Victoria throughout
the elections was :
1. Reduce high duties.
2. Reduce extravagant expenditure.
3. Reduce cost of government.
i. For any new revenue tax wealth in all its forms.
Then the elections came, and Patterson and the
Argus were routed. The day after Parliament
re-gathered the Argus attempted a strategic
retreat. The creed for the country, it said, advo-
cated by us and adopted by the country, is as
follows: —
1. Direct taxation.
2. Reduced cost of government.
3. Tariff reform.
Here we see the right-about. “ Tax wealth in all
its forms ” was the last resort in the old creed, but
now it is No. 1. There must be some real political
worth in Victoria when the Argus trims like this.
A Melb. lady lately returned home after a
brief absence and found the front door open, most
of the portable goods packed up for removal, and
a gentlemanly-looking person on the premises.
As she entered he took off his glossy hat and ex-
plained matters. He had been passing by, it
seemed, and detecting signs of burglary he entered
and engaged in a desperate conflict with a
rough-looking malefactor, whom he at length
routed with great slaughter. Then he stood
guard over the property until the return of
the rightful owner, and was pleased to say,
&c. Here he took off his hat again, and the
flurried lady suddenly noticed, with a shriek of
dismay, that it was her husband’s hat, and that
he had her husband’s clothes on, and that her
husband’s watch-chain was hanging out of his
pocket, whereupon the gentlemanly person sprinted
away down the street and vanished. He was cap-
tured later on. All of which goes to show that
politeness is not always profitable. If he hadn’t
taken off the borrowed hat so effusively, the
chances are that no special attention would have
been drawn to it and the rest of his borrowed
plumes.

Canvassers reckon that, granted lOmin. in-
terview with a prospective buyer, the sale of an
article is practically complete. The trouble is to
get 10 minutes’ talk. People, as a rule, don’t give
the canvasser a chance to properly introduce him-
self. The door opens an inch or two, in answer
to his gentle, insinuating tap, and before he has
time to speak somebody snaps, “Nothing to day.’
Then bang goes the door! This device has hither-
to been to the householder what a similar bang-
ing of the door on the “retreating form” of an
“awakening woman ” is to Ibsen and the up-to-
date novel-writers on social questions—it saves a
deal of explanation and trouble. But the wily
fin-de-sUcle canvasser, when every respectable un-
employed is of the genus, has invented a method
of preventing this ill-treatment of the innocent
door. He fixes upon a house, trips gaily up the
front steps, and gives one great tug at the bell-
pull and lets go. Ere the jangling of the bell
ceases, an infuriated Somebody is there to in-
vestigate the meaning of the violence. Just
what the canvasser wants, for the door doesn’r
bang during these enquiries 1 With a peace-be-to
this-house kind of smile on a slightly-abashed
countenance, and raising his hat politely, he pro-
ceeds to explain, amid profuse apologies, that the
bell-pull was stiff and jerky, that he slipped and
clutched wildly at it to avert a fall—anything, in
short, to prevent the banging of the door. Then
gradually and skilfully the apologies glide, almost
imperceptibly, into an all-round introduction of
any article he may have on sale. People like
being apologised to—it gives them a good opinion
of themselves—and the mollified housewife who
came in a violent hurry to sool the canvasser oil
the premises, and to bang the door, generally
remains to buy. What is wanted now is for
someone to invent means for stopping the eternul
door-banging in latter-day fiction, when the
heroine awakens to her mission, and goes out into
the cruel world, never, never to return, leaving
her husband to tend the baby.

Tales of the Riverine.
THE SNAGGING OF THE BAUCY NELL.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
“Half-speed astern ! Easy now, for rd!
Stand ready wi’ the fenders ! Slow ’em down !
What’s her depth, Fred ? ’Stern there—sling off
the barge-rope ! Gently, now, gently ! D !
that lubbe«mit ’ud make a parson swear ! Easy,
now, easy ! Fend her off that timber, Johnson !”
So, with breathless exclamations in a high,
harsh naonotong, Skipper Cane whipped his men
into methodic, intelligent action, and brought the
Saucy Nell and her barge carefully against the
hillock on which stood the slaughtering gallows of
Caloonaga homestead. .
Going up stream, ten days back, to Menmdie,
the Nell had passed that hillock and homestead
half s a-mfle to the westward. The river was then
falling, and at places she had to throw out
warps and tackling and haul up over the bed
ridges and half-emerging snags. Now, the trunks
to which her warps had been fastened were them-
selves half-a-mile to the westward of her present
position; and her paddles beat the surface of a
plain of water between 30 and 40 feet above the
level of that they skimmed up voyage, when the
Nell had scraped with her bottom planks the roots
which great gums on the river-margin had thrust
treacherously out into the river.
Within that short period Nature had burst into
one of those grim, ironic moods with which she
occasionally tempers her tyranny over the Far
West of the Riverine —as though Peter the Cruel
sought his recreation in wearing the mask of Vol-
taire, or Torquemada that of the mocking Heine.
* * *
Nature had held the West in the red-hot
bonds of drought long enough to drive many a
brave pioneering soul into the sweating-rooms of
the banks and cognate purgatories, and now she
answered the universal prayer for rain by sending
a deluge that was only less destructive than the
drought. “Up north,” the middle country, and
the southern areas which ran up to the Murray—
all had shared in the derisive outpouring of the
sky’s fountains ; and already life that had hardly
survived the strangling heat was fighting with
might and main the throttling waters. Man,
cattle, and sheep, the feathered things and the
creeping things, cowered beneath the storm as they
had shrivelled beneath the scorching sun. The rain-
gaugers grew neglectful of the erstwhile precious
“ points,” and affected contempt for anything less
than “inches and odds were offered more freely
than they were taken as to the likelihood of the
flood-marks of ’64 being easily surpassed. “ Sixty-
four” was the standard year of terror on the
Darling till this season —which was to hold the
prize of wretchedness till the fateful ’9O.
For ’64 had not known the desolation that this
year of the late seventies was to know.
Settlement was sparse and intermittent then;
now mammoth rUJM jostled one another and shared
boundary-fences Then, the selector was repre-
sented by a dummy hut per six-forty-acre block.
Now, the staunch souls who had “ peacocked,” to
the gnashing of squatters’ teeth, and who declined
to be bought out, were by no means rare.
With the people, the people’s homes were chang-
ing to a different order of architecture than the
primeval slab-hut and bare, rude, “w.b.” home
stead. And stock had multiplied and increased
in the land tenfold. So, what with one thing and
another, the devils of drought and flood reaped
a rich harvest of ruin. The glory of success
and the ideals of enjoyment which dull, prosaic
labour, continued for years, had brought within
reach of the Far West settlers, was thrust just
beyond gra>sp by the thought. Then came the
swirling, hurling rains and washed all dreams of
success, all possibilities of pleasure, almost all
realities of achievement, still farther away, till
feeble hearts drowned, and great ones drooped.
The hell of the heat, and the hell of the waters—
between them what hope of the paradise which is
created by a full purse?
* * *
Fairfax’s Caloonaga station had been un-
fortunate, though not singularly so. Its 40,000
sheep had been reduced, by three years of grass-
lessness, to 25,000. The lambings had been lamb-
ings of a percentage so paltry that “ the cove ”
was ashamed to send in the usual par. to the
Pastobal Times. The rivers had been “ down
and, consequently, what poor clip of wool there
was had either been carted to Wentworth at
enormous expense, or else was still in the shed
waiting transit. When he negotiated the pur-
chase the agent through whom he bought had
demonstrated, on paper, with facile lip and pen,
the magnificent results that would be realised in
these magic three years.
“ Wool ?” Oh, that would never be lower than
a shilling a pound in the grease! “Stores?”
Bless you—dirt cheap! “Fats?” —the native
grasses on Caloonaga were almost as succulent as
the Terinallum, or Werronggurt, English-grassed
pastures in famous Western Vic., and it only cost
a trifle to drive “fats” to the great Victorian
markets ! “ Removal of clip—carriage of stores ?”
Why, Providence had specially designed Caloonaga
to be a fortune-breeding run, and did not the
Darling flow with its broad, navigable stream
within half-a-mile of the station and homestead,
thus affording the most remarkable facilities!
“ Selectors ?” Devil a one of them on the station
except those who had dummied on its behalf !
Site of homestead, freehold—all best spots of run,
if there could be any best where all was good—
also dummied in interests of owners ! “ Why was
this desirable and profitable property in the
market, then?” Oh, vendor made his pile, going
“ home ” to spend it —wouldn’t sell now if he had
any intention of coming back again, but old folks
at home, y’ know —fond of ’em—go back, and play
part of Lord Bountiful, y’ know !
Thus, the agent—on paper, and with most plau-
sible and most eloquent of voices; and'Fairfax
drew a cheque for twenty thousand pounds, signed
bills for fifty thousand more, and—forgot to
obtain a guarantee against droughts and floods.
And so, when the Saucy Nell pushed her nose
over what, two days before, had been a heat-
cursed plain, and clutched with one of her grap-
nels the crossbar of the butcher’s gallows, he had
no heart to enjoy the, novelty of the spectacle.
The up-springing of the waters had nearly com-
pleted, he thought, what the dry term had begun.
With twenty-five thousand sheep, his wool at
Echuca, and a fair season, he might have saved
foreclosure at least. With ten thousand rotting
carcases, floated by the swollen waters into the tops
of scrub and mallee and the branches of red-gum
and blackwood, the dismal watery waste before
him was not the dismalest of prospects that his
eye beheld at intervals. He caught a glimpse also
of the desert of bankruptcy, with never an oasis
of hope therein. He knew he was not alone in his
plight, but whenever did another’s pangs bring
true healing to one’s own wounds ?
Fairfax had been but a few years out
from England, and had not, therefore, like so
many other Ri veiiue squatters, been made tanu lar
with vicissitudes by an experience of the gold-
diggings. Men who had known the rough-and-
tumble of existence on the Turon, Forest Free <,
the VVaranga, and Ballarat; who had been one day
as paupers and on the morrow as princes; who had
borne the stress of long despair, and the more
intense strain of a plunge into sudden wealth; who
had flung away aimlessly in thriftless profusion the
gold which was never to come again to them ; men
of these experiences would have taken another
“ facer ” from fortune with something of Spartan
philosophy. They would have given over the
station to the mortgagees agent without fuss, and
have stepped out valiantly on the wallaby—conn-
dent that if the dice fell against them this tune
they might, fall toward them at another.
Fairfax was not of such tempered and tried
stuff. His twenty thousand had been in-
herited ; and his nature knew not the
strengthening which goes with the accumula-
tion of gold, when the gold is won by the
honest work of the man himself and is not coined
out of the heart-blood of others. He was, to tell
the truth, but a poor creature as yet. What
adversity would make of him has to be seen.
He welcomed the Saucy Nell’s skipper with a
feeble smile and speech of feebler humor as he
brought the boats across the low_ banks which
separated and would separate again the station
buildings from the river. .
“ Well, Captain, you’ve scarcely to complain of
knocking up your hands warping now ! ”
“No, Mr. Fairfax—that’s not our trouble now.
It never rains but it pours out here, and, by Jove,
we’ve got the pouring to rights ! Forty feet above
summer level already, and another ten feet coming
—what with the Paroo and the Queensland back
waters! Tnere’s going to be a h of a time,
sir ! ” , , ,
Fairfax started at the news, and abandoned any
resolve he might have had to sustain his poor
attempt at jocularity. Another ten feet would
overwhelm all his as yet unsubmerged ground,
and then—good-bye to the remnants of his flocks
which were too weak to travel up country ! With
the vividly-pessimistic imagination of the spine-
less man, he, in the next moment, saw the water
rise and spread, and keep on spreading, encroach-
ing upon the phantom of pasturage left him,
drowning it and the paltry thousands of stupid
sheep; he heard it lapping against the sagging
boards of his woolshed, where the ninety-odd bales
which represented his past year’s clip were await-
ing removal; he felt it sapping his homestead
and his future. Like all weak men, he ex-
aggerated the possibilities ; and to a weak man
his fantastic terrors are very real. To lairfax
it was as though, in very deed, the advancing
edge of the water bore ruin in its darkest form
insidiously upon him.
“ Another rise ! God !’’ he muttered, dazedly.
Skipper Cane stared at him, with something of
contempt in his look. Cane himself had been
clewed up once or twice by dry spells, and he made
fresh starts again and again. Hundreds of others
had done the same. What the dickens, then,
should the boss of Caloonaga be so fearful about.
“ Well, Mr. Fairfax—steady, there, you chaps
with them poles his men were poling the barge
into what had been a “ dead finish ” scrub before
the flood came down—“you’ll have her ripped up
’fore you know where you are—beg pardon, Mr.
Fairfax, but those d looneys don’t think of
five minutes ahead, and I was just going to say
you think too far ahead. You’re given t“
veck’ning the loss on the insurance before you
snagged the craft! Ain’t you now, sir t
The escaping steam was hissing loudly, ami
perhaps overcame the skipper’s voice, or perhaps
the squatter did not appreciate the river metaphor.
No one “ever counted the chickens before they
were hatched ”on the rivers—you always “ drank
the village whisky before the grog was shipped
Neither did any one “meet trouble half-way.
It was always “ counting the loss on the insurance
before the boat was snagged.” But Fairfax was
in no mood to apply the metaphor if he understood
it. He took it literally. . , , ,
“ What do you mean, Captain ? he questioned
nervously. “Do you think there is any danger ot
snagging ? What’ll become of my wool ?”
“I see, Mr. Fairfax,” laughed the skipper,
“ you don’t understand me ! I meant as you re a
little bit too hasty in counting the worst of things.
Things never kern out so bad as we suspect-that s
my motter, sir.” ,_ . , . „
“Oh, hang philosophy!” rejoined Fairfax, lull
of the thought suggested by Cane’s previous
words. “Is there really any special danger oi
your snagging this trip ?”
“ Well, there is—and there’s no use a-denymg
it!”
“ Good God !” . .
“ Oh, I don’t say as I’d grow funky on it, sir,
if I were you .”
“Funky ! —Can’t you understand, man, that
that .” Here he held his speech. He was
becoming foolishly expansive—he reflected. Wby
should he take this rough boatman into his confi-
dence? Why should he tell him how much the
safety of the down cargo meant to him ! He fell
back into the reticence of his class. A fatal reti-
cence, perhaps, as it proved.
• * *
If he had expressed to Cane his fear as to
the danger of the down-trip to Echuca, and his
sense of the tremendous importance to him of the
issues dependent upon it, would the result have
been different ? It is doubtful. When the rivers
were up flood-high, Randell himself, that Columbua
of the Riverine, could not be sure of carrying
himself and his crafts safe into port. You lost
your bearings so easily ! Where was that clump
of mallee that fringed the bluff where the great
Aua branch debouched ? Where were the giant
gums that were ghastly in their unsheathed white-
ness even when the radiance of sunlit skies
shimmered and sheened in the lagoons and billa-
bongs? Where was Wood-Pile Point, which was
the signal of danger hard by the shifting and
treacherous sand-spit that was wont to cuddle
snags till the water above it was stirred by
paddles, and would then jerk up the jagged sides
of felon trees into the planking ? Where were the
blacks’ gunyahs which betokened the approach to
Sturt’s billabong, and warned the steersman to
ware the tangental force of the current at the
bend ? Where the patch of rat-tail grass on open
country by Poencarra, thedelight of the rouseabouts
eyes, because it meant to them a long reach whereon
would be fair running, and, therefore, a time of
loafing and no bothersome sounding. Where were
these and the thousand other guiding-marks?
Under the greenish-blue water, all of them, save
the gums. Those only you saw, and only
their crestc. even then. All the rest were
submerged, and steering was a nightmare.
You poled into good water, and the next instant
your bottoms were crushing through the tops of
mulga. You zig-zagged timorously with the
steamer into a clear channel, and her barge, with

ince or Wales.
a shade less beam than the boat had at the paddle-
boxes, jostled and reeled against some floating
timber that you had slipped over. The dark patch
yonder—was it the bluff at the wood-pile or the
island twenty miles beyond the woodpile? Had
you got back into the natural stream, or were you
in one of Fitzwilliam Wentworth’s stockyards?
Where were you, or, rather, where weren’t you?
The Lord only knew !
Now, with Fairfax’s small clip aboard, topping
up the two hundred which were all, mindful of
the state of the rivers, he had ventured to take
from Menindie, skipper Oane had a light load
enough, and had the streams been certain he
would have skimmed to the junction landslip and
thence to Echuca at racing speed. But the waters
were, as we say, the reverse of certain. The only
certainty about them was that the channel he
thought he was in was distinctly some other
channek
The waters had wiped out the map, and the
nverman’s special knowledge. They amazed him,
knotted his perceptions confusingly, made him
stupid.
* « *
When an ordinarily intelligent man
becomes stupid he also becomes desperate. He is
beaten by the bowelless gods of Fact; and if he
does not take to drink he attempts to ride rough-
shod over things as they are with the impulsive-
ness of an unreasoning animalism. Cane’s care-
fulness being plagued out of him, he literally “let
the boats rip.” If they went over, all right ; if
they didn’t, well, they wouldn’t, and that was the
end of it. He knew the Menindie wool was
insured—he himself was pretty well “covered”
—and if Fairfax was not protected by an “open
policy,” well (again) that was Fairfax’s look-out.
No one but a fool would ship uninsured wool
when the rivers were at flood depth and had
effaced the map. And with the sophistry that comes
so readily to help a man in his silliness, and which
is the only ally the gods then give him, Oane
ordered his engineer to “ stroke her up,”and “let
her rip.”
And, five days from Menindie, the Saucy Nell
did, and her barge with her, in the very next
moment. They were, so Cane suspected, some-
where about Tapio, in the main channel. But he
saw nothing of the homestead, only the whitened
carcases of drowned stock with hawks rejoicing
over the Apician banquets. The irony of it!
The birds were feeding, not on carrion, but on
gold !
A deck-hand was at the wheel. Oane was
for’ard, reckless and moody, his spirits tempered
by the gloomy day. They had given up the mono-
tonous poling. “Let her rip—and be damned!”
Then The boat scraped—shivered—throbbed !
The paddles jarred but did not stop. A groaning
and rending followed as she drove onwards—and
then a gurgling as the water forced its way
between the knees.
Cane was alert and sobered now. The immi-
nence of danger re-spiced bis energies. When it
was too late he shouted out his orders. The
seething water would not, however, let the words
reach the ears of the engineer. “Full astern!”
might have saved her from possibly more damage.
But, with “Full ahead !” on the dial, more rend-
ing of planks, more gashing of cross-timbers—even
a stanchion supporting the machinery decking
was torn from its sockets by the huge, protuberant
mg that had worked the mischief. When the
stanchion had gone the engineer understood
and shut off steam 4 Then the great lo
held her; and as, in the murkiness of the
day and the brooding monotony of the trip,
the bargeman, too, had dulled to his duty he
let the barge come unchecked right stem on to the
steamer. The shock of the contact made her
recoil, but leading by its violence to the displace-
ment of the top tiers of wool, these broke their
lashings, and by a sudden shifting forward drove
the barge once more upon the steamer, which was
now settling down in about fifteen feet of water.
The second impact and the movement of the cargo
served the barge a like fatal turn to that which
had ruined the Saucy Nell. She quivered from
stem to stern ; the wheel-platform, thrown out of
gear by the displacement of the wool, rendered
the rudder-chains useless; she passed from a trim,
tautly-held craft into an unmanageable mass. A
plank started forward, and the surging in of the
stream did the rest. She, too, settled down.
The men made their way as best they could to
the pilot-house. That was the only unsubmerged
part of the craft. They cursed their luck and
their skipper. And Cane listened without a word,
for he knew that he deserved all their impreca-
tions. The devil was in him that he had lost his
head ! With the heavens bursting above him and
the new waters coming down to swell the flood
around him, he and his boats might be doomed to
stop there a month—perhaps two, perhaps three.
A.nd where was he in the stream —within hauling
distance of it, or half a mile inwards ?”
The men gibed him, and he stood their rudeness
patiently. But when one more thoughtful than
others said, “This will about fix up Fairfax, of
Caloonaga !” Cane asked him his meaning.
“Fairfax’s storekeeper told me as he was
a-tallyin’ out the clip from the shed that this was
Fairfax’s last show.”
“How d’ye mean ?”
“ Why, he meant as the bank is a-comin’ down
on the cove, unless he’d got this wool to ’Chuca
within a for’night ! They gave him that chance—
he was to deliver his wool at the w’arves to their
agent, or be clewed up and cleared out. This was
his last show—an’ now you’ve damned it nicely !’’
“ An’ Fairfax,” broke in the mate, “ told me as
his open policy had run out, so he ain’t insured 1”
Cane, rough enough, but not a man to bluff and
bounce in the presence of calamity for which he
was responsible, said nothing. What was the use
of saying anything when nothing could be done?
And there was nothing to be done. Snagging in
a low river is not the greatest of disasters, bad
though it be. Snagging away from the river-
banks, in flood-time, is a very different thing.
Only a fellow who can draw drafts upon a special
Providence with a certainty of their being
honored, could laugh at it.
No, there was nothing to be done except to wait
for the waters to go down ; except to send out the
dingy in search of a station homestead where the
men might obtain tucker and shelter.
• * ft
And Fairfax?
Not always do ill tidings fly. Circumstance
makes Time a laggard, sometimes, even when his
wallet is burdened with woe instead of weal.
It was three weeks before “the cove” at
Caloonaga heard the news, though he was but
a day’s coaching from the spot where the
snagged crafts rested. Eight miles from Tapio
homestead, and a good quarter of a mile from the
river banks, they lay. That was what the mate
in charge of the dingy had discovered. Tapio
had sent the intelligence to Wentworth by mys-
terious cross-country routes, which somehow
never passed within cooey of Caloonaga. And so
it was that when Fairfax heard of it the news
came from Echuca by a hawker’s launch, which
brought over also the mailman from Wentworth
side. The dreaded notice of foreclosure, and the
order to give delivery of everything to the Moama
Company’s agent, were in his loose-bag.
‘‘The floods being up may prevent Mr. ’s
arrival for some days after this should reach you,”
wrote the managing director, “ but at the earliest
possible moment he shall be with you, and relieve
you of your responsibility to us. . . . My
directors regret to be compelled to take the ex-
treme step of foreclosing, but their duty to our
shareholders leaves them no alternative, as you
did not take advantage of the time allowed for the
delivery of the balance of your clip to our order at
Echuca.”
So, with many flourishes of pen, professing him-
self, too, to be his, Fairfax’s, “ very faithfully,”
the managing director concluded, by one and the
same action, the letter and Fairfax’s career.
# * *
When the agent of the company arrived
to take charge, he took delivery of something not
in the bond —a suicide’s body.
It was weak and cowardly, of course. But
stronger men than Fairfax have refused the
contest with Fate when she encases herself in
sheets of parchment. The weapon of a courageous
spirit may cleave a coat-of-mail, but seldom a
mortgage deed. And, in this case, Finance and
Law were aided by sardonic Nature.
Nature has no pity for the weak. Neither has
the Law ; nor Finance.

Sydney Olivier, son-in-law to an English
judge and one of the authors of the famous
Fabian essays on Socialism, thus rushes into the
breach on the breeches controversy in London
Daily Chronicle
The characteristic formation of hips and legs that
makes most adult women look ridiculous in knickerbooker
costume has been imposed on the normal woman as the
condition of maternal survival. On this ground it seems
likely to persist; and the skirt to persist in its company
from considerations of convenience as well as beauty.
But we all of us know women who look, or would look,
quite as graceful in knickerbockers as they do in skirts, if
not more so, and why any ungrown girl at all should wear
skirts, I cannot imagine. We may be sure that the un-
gracefully-shaped women are not likely, as a rule, to take
to breeches if they value their appearance above con-
venience. If they don’t, what will men’s ridicule or re-
monstrances avail, which again and again have proved
powerless against inelegance and inconvenience of fashion
combined ? The knickerbockerophobist may take comfort
if he reflects that it cannot be convenient to most women
or compatible with the vanity of many, to wear knicker
bookers continually all their lives.
“I am confident,” remarked Queen ViC-
toria to the British Parliament, “ that you will
share in the joy with which I and my people have
welcomed the birth of an heir in the third genera-
tion to my Throne, an event not merely pro-
pitious, but unprecedented in the history of this
country.” Of England, yes. But not unpre
cedented in history. Louis XIV. of France once
made a similar boast. He and his eldest son, and
his eldest son’s eldest son, and his eldest ’son’s
eldest son’s eldest son were all alive at the same
time. But he lived to see them all dead. What’s
the betting even now that Princess May, of the
Dead Heart, will ever be Queen of England ?
