GROWING
WITH A NATION
By supplying light, power and communications, above and below
the surface, in metalliferous and in brown and black coal
mining, Olympic Cables are playing an important role in the
growth of mining in Australia. As the mining industry
continues its spectacular expansion, Olympic cables,
wires and flexibles will continue to service this
continuing growth, so vital to the
jjL Australian economy. ,•-/

YARDSTICK
TIME WAS when every popular enter-
tainer longed to boast that he “earned
more than the Prime Minister.” How-
ever, the modest salary w’e pay the
Prime Minister is no longer adequate
even as a measuring-stick. Sydney
radio-announcer John Laws in a recent
interview claimed that he “was making
more than Graham Kennedy.”
DEFINITION
ANY CAREFULLY nurtured girl at
Manly Girls’ High School who didn’t
know what the Sydney “Daily Mirror”
meant when it delicately referred to
“bull—” was certainly given a splendid
example by the Mirror making a front-
page story out of a teacher at the
school setting an examination paper on
a chapter on morals and manners by
Max Harris, containing the word, in
Peter Coleman’s anthology “Australian
Civilisation.”
SHIFT IN TARGET
THE REMARKABLE THING about
human prejudice is not its rigidity, but
its ability to shift target. The London
“Sunday Times” in an article on the
controversy stirred up by the current
British Race Relations Bill, points out
that in the early ’fifties it was easier
for a professional West Indian to find
a suitable place in Britain than for an
Australian; then it was accent rather
than color.
VACANCY
THERE IS certainly no shortage of
newspaper columnists, but there seems
to be a great lack of short and suitable
titles to crown their efforts. There you
have your new columnist, waiting
eagerly to spill his view on to paper,
and no one around the office can think
of a damned thing to call the stuff.
No sooner had The Bulletin dropped
"“On the Margin” above Ross Camp-
bell’s pieces (we really feel that Camp-
hell stands alone), than Cyril Pearl
snapped it up for his pieces on books
in “The Sydney Morning Herald.”
TO GLASGOW
WILLIAM FRATER, aged 78 and
Glasgow-born, is one of Australia’s most
durable artists. A pioneer of modern
art, he is represented in all major
Australian art galleries. However, when
Gordon Thompson, as deputy director
of the Victorian Gallery, was in Scot-
land last year, he discovered that
although the Glasgow gallery has a
good section devoted to artists born
in Glasgow, Frater is not there. Mem-
bers of The Victorian Artists’ Society,
of which Frater is president, have sub-
scribed to buy a Frater painting, which
will be presented to the Glasgow
Gallery later this year. The painting is
a semi-abstract oil, based on the Aus-
tralian bush.
LATE IN THE DAY
PETER DU SAUTOY, leader of the
British publishers’ mission now in Aus-
tralia, nodded in the direction of a pile
of papers and pamphlets all but
obscuring a table in his Sydney hotel
room.
“Everybody’s been very kind with
all this information,” he said mildly,
producing as proof a foolscap dossier
full of information about Australian
universities.
Not quite halfway through his share
of the country’s colleges and univer-
sities, Mr. du Sautoy hadn’t had time
for many conclusions, but, rather
unexpectedly, he admitted some surprise
at Australian universities’ interest in
South-East Asia. “We had been con-
sidering a particular study of inter-
national relations of this area. But I
wasn’t aware that people were actually
teaching students these subjects.”
Actually, the co-operation of the uni-
versities is hardly surprising, since they
must benefit from the British publishers’
new, but extraordinarily intense, interest
Peter du Sautoy.. . some surprises
in their requirements. The mission com-
prises 14 members, representatives of
Britain’s leading publishing houses,
including the two senior academic
presses, Oxford and Cambridge, and
they are making an energetic, if belated,
attempt to canvass the needs of every
Australian university and the larger
training colleges during 16 days of
frenetic activity.
There are two teams - spanning the
country independently from Perth to
Sydney, Hobart to Townsville, and
pausing long enough to get together and
compare notes in Melbourne and
Sydney this week.
The main reason for all this, as the
publishers themselves have admitted,
is the success the American textbook
publishers have had in capturing a large
part of the Australian market, especially
in science, mathematics and science. “I
suppose it’s because American teaching
methods are closer to the Australian
ones,” ventured Mr. du Sautoy, presi-
dent of the Publishers’ Association and
vice-chairman of Faber and Faber. A
lean, grey-haired, rather diffident man
whose special interests are literature,
history, and sociology, he looks a little
too gentlemanly for all this competitive
bustle.
“We compete strenuously with the
Americans, but in a friendly way. We
keep in close touch with them, and, of
course, publish one another’s books. But
another reason for this mission is the
growth of universities, both here and at
home. So many red-brick universities
have sprung up since the war, and
they and the Australian universities
seem to have much in common.
There are a lot of interesting,,
creative writers here, too. Yes, we are
thinking about publishing books of Aus-
tralian interest especially for Australian
universities, but mainly we want to
find out if there are certain types of
books already being published by us
which may be more useful for Aus-
tralians than those we publish here.
At the advanced levels, textbooks
are fairly international, but it’s more
difficult to fix on the right books for
first-year students.”
Mr. du Sautoy added that the price
reductions forced by devaluation will
come into effect on June 1, when, he
said, all British books will be almost
nine percent cheaper.
He also commented on the fact that
last July, the Berne Convention, which
controls world copyright, ruled that
educational and cultural books be
offered to underdeveloped countries
free of royalties. “British publishers
and authors opposed this because this
isn’t the way it should be done. Per-
haps books could be sold at a cheaper
rate with government help so that
royalties could still be paid, rather than
the principle of copyright being thrown
away. In the long run it’s not even in
the interests of the underdeveloped
countries, because they’ll need copyright
protection for their own writers.
“But although British publishers
opposed it we couldn’t vote against
the propoal because it was embodied
in a revision containing a lot of other
things we wanted. And if we’d voted
‘no,’ they would have been lost. So it’s
gone through. But it hasn’t operated
yet because no underdeveloped country
has taken advantage of it so far.”
Mr. du Sautoy joined the library
staff of the British Museum after
graduating from Oxford, and in 1946,
went to Faber and Faber.
Australians on Faber’s list of authors
include Professor Alan Shaw (“The
Story of Australia,” “Convicts and

TIME MEANS MONEY
WITH A RESOLUTENESS worthy of
le General himself, the French w'atch
industry is preparing an onslaught on
the ovenvhelming hold which the Swiss
have on the Australian market. Last
w'eek at the Wentworth Hotel, Sydney,
and this w'eek at the Southern Cross,
Melbourne, the French showed to trade
and Press a valuable collection from
12 makers, in an atmosphere redolent
of Cartier, w'ith a liberal dash of James
Bond.
The message the French Watch In-
formation Centre w'as out to proclaim
is that its industry, which has had phe-
nomenal growth (3,500,000 watch and
movement sales outside the franc area
last year, a jump of 44 percent on th*-
previous year) turns out a quality pro-
duct. This, they say, is mainly the
result of the w'ork of the technical
centre of the industry, Cetehor (Centre
Technique de llndustrie Horlogere).
Jewel-level w'atches, as distinct from
cheaper ones, w'hich usually have no
functional jew'els and are difficult to
repair, account for 80 percent of French
production, and they claim this is a
higher percentage than Sw'iss, German,
U.S., or Japanese makers.
At the Wentworth Hotel exhibition,
one local man in the trade said the
French display in a w'ay represented
what the Australian jewellers should do
more frequently on their owrn behalf—
thrust openly into the marketplace and
not w'ait for buyers of discrimination to
find them out. The family watch-and-
jewellery business cannot stand alone
and aloof today. Now' w'atches are in
department store window's and show-
cases, and at least one retail chain is
prepared to sell diamonds at
limited only by the customer’s cash
resources.
POET IN DEMAND
THE TELEPHONE rang for the third
time, and Bryn Griffiths stood up to
answer it. This time somebody was
asking him to speak at a Vietnam
protest meeting.
Mr. Griffiths, a 33-year-old Welsh
poet gifted with traditional Welsh
garrulousness, is in Australia on a
lecture tour, and it seems everybody
wants to hear him — from the pro-
testors to the students at Abbotsleigh
girls’ school. Perhaps his popularity is
an indication of the hidden hunger for
words people have claimed dwells
beneath the great Australian reticence.
But whatever it is Mr. Griffiths is in
demand.
“You know, they’re mostly women,”
he said, returning from the telephone
with an expression on his face which
recalled the fact that he had, in an
earlier interview, listed his likes as
“poetry, the sea, beer, Wales, women,
and women again.”
Certainly he has a romantic story
to tell a Welsh miner’s son who
grew up around Swansea’s docks, left
school at 14 and went to sea, where he
led a seamen’s strike and almost killed
a man in a brawl. “That was a shock,”
he said, searching in a cupboard for a
packet of tea. “It made me see that
the sea was brutalising me, and that I
had to leave it.”
Next, the qualities that had earned
him the childhood nickname of “Bryn
the Bookworm” asserted themselves,
and he enrolled himself in an English
course at a Welsh college, then, two
years later, went to London and wrote
his first poems. “Nearly starved for the
first six months, but I eventually sold
a poem to a Welsh newspaper and the
whole thing spiralled from there.”

Everyone's up in armchairs...
It's an attractive Cause!
As soon as people hear about the BOAC Armchair,
they tend to get excited.
The most comfortable economy class seat in the
world . . . masses more legroom . . . deep, comfort-
able contours, smothered in soft upholstery. That’s
the kind of thing that attracts an army of armchair
partisans.
And creates some side benefits. Because these days
the company up in the Armchairs is fun—not to
mention varied. Beards and blondes, financiers and
farmers. All because BOAC went to so much trouble
with the seat. Contoured it so it fits everyone—
nobody has to fit it.
BOAC have 10 Armchair flights a week out of
Australia to London and Europe. Seven a week West
via India, three a week East via the U.S.A.
So see your BOAC Travel Agent, BOAC, or Qantas,
General Sales Agents for BOAC.
When you book, tell them the Armchair’s the cause.
And you’re joining it.

above all, a humanist,” Griffiths believes
poetry should have a social conscience.
“Poets have a duty to say something
to people about the world. Of course
I’ve written love poems which are
highly obscure and personal done
almost entirely for my own enjoyment
although they ring an echo some-
where in someone else. But I don’t
think my other poems one about
Aberfan, and ‘Hill 881’ about the Viet-
nam war aren’t personal, because
thousands of people identify with these
things.
“I’m a nationalist only because I
think Wales has always had a rough
deal. Even now the Labor Government
is closing down mines and putting
people out of work without providing
any alternative employment. People
have to move away from Wales to
places like Birmingham, and they lose
their distinctive Welsh characteristics
and get lost in the big mass.”
He was drinking tea now and look-
ing cheerfully at a photograph of him-
self on the jacket of one of his books.
“No, I don’t find poetry easy to write.
I’ve got notebooks full of rough poems
which I keep on going back to. I write
the initial idea down before I forget
it.
“I did 19 versions of the Aberfan
poem, and it’s a long poem 25
stanzas. I went to Aberfan to do a tele-
vision documentary some time after it
was over, and I started the poem
months after I got back. It was written
over the course of a year.”
The thesis hunters from Buffalo, he
added, were still busy exhuming Dylan
Thomas manuscripts, but this activity
apart, Welsh poetry was experiencing
something of a renaissance. “We’ve
started a Welsh Writers’ Guild and
the Welsh Nationalist Theatre is start-
ing up. There’s a good deal going on.”

LOOSENING
THE TIES
OF CONFORMITY
HERE IN Melbourne we depend
deeply on the necktie. It is a symbol
of utmost faith, like believing in pure
books, sober Sundays, and the divine
right of football. It may appear to you
as an utterly useless item which never
does a serious job of work like a belt
or a pair of trousers, but to us it is
the symbol of respectability. It separates
the nice people from the politically
dangerous.
All through history leaders of the
community have been terrified by the
tieless ones. It is well known that
people without ties will stop at
nothing. Life is infinitely more safe
if every morning all necks are tied up
with sober ties at 9 a.in. The tie
signifies that one pays his taxes,
believes in Sir Henry Bolte, and walks
on the correct side of the footpath.
Melbourne takes this so seriously
that we reject non-tie wearers at once.
We are not brilliant, perhaps, as the
South Australia Hotel, at tossing out
the tieless ones, but we are not bad.
So far this year the Windsor Hotel has
asked a distinguished American surgeon
not to wear his skivvy at breakfast,
and a U.S. film producer was not per-
mitted to wear his roll-neck sweater in
the lounge bar at the Southern Cross.
This was wise. Who knows what
dangerous thoughts such men would
harbor. What alarms your corres-
pondent is this. The tie appears to be
in danger. Lord Snowdon has been dis-
pensing with his tie, even for formal
occasions. Skip Ward, the manager to
Miss Stella Stevens, a lady who is said
to have a remarkable gift for infor-
mality, spent much of his time in Mel-
bourne in a roll-neck. Then, for the
opening night of “Tosca” at the Princess
Theatre, Harry Miller turned out in
a single-breasted dinner jacket, but one
could only shudder at the rest. Not only
was he tieless, but his skivvy was pink.
But what really gave cause for alarm
was this: A Myer advertisement on the
front page of the “Herald” announced
“turtle-neck evening shirts for men . . .
all dressed up for full-dress occasions
. . . knitted with an ever so slight
touch of glitter . . . all with double
cuffs.” It was important to get round
there immediately, and the situation
was even worse than one had feared.
The array was extraordinary. There
was a choice of formal roll-necks with
lace around the throat or in the purest
of white nylon. One model, for $l2,
made in Italy, was a no-iron model
“just wash in warm water.” Then there
were roll-necks with gorgeous lace,
trimmed with black all down the chest.
But the fascinating point was this: they
all had zips down the back. So a gentle-
man upon setting out for the evening
has to be zipped into his shirt, presum-
ably by his lady love.
So from now there will be this beau-
tiful relationship, the male being zipped
into his shirt by his lady, then he in
turn zipping her into her gown. Yet it
is well known that bachelor girls fre-
quently have to suffer the embarrass-
ment at the end of an evening of having
to ask the taxi-driver to come in and
undo their zips. Somehow it might be
even more embarrassing for a bachelor
chap having to ask the taxi-driver to
come in and undo his zip.
Our expert at Myer’s, Mr. Andrew
Thomas, revealed the sinister trend. He
said roll-necks were the rage from
formal right through to casual wear.
There was no need to wear pristine-
white roll-necks on formal occasions.
One could be gay like Harry Miller. He
had roll-necks in gleaming satin in pink,
green, gold, blue, and most gorgeous of
burgundies. Furthermore, he was getting
in some materials with marvellous self
patterns like the old-fashioned table-

cloths. Naturally, one searched for a
glint of alarm in the eyes of Mr.
Thomas. Even if one discarded the
social aspect, surely ties had a vast
commercial value. Think of Father’s
Day.
Ah, but that was covered. The very
latest thing was for the male to wear
a pendant, sitting on the centre of
one’s sternum like a KCMG. Mr.
Thomas brought out the latest from
the U.S.A. and these were heavy gold
chains with splendid badges at the
base. One of them sported the imperial
eagle of Germany. The price was quite
satisfactory from the Myer point of
view, $3.50 each.
Mr. Thomas did not believe that
the tie would be affected for business-
wear. Here it would remain supreme.
But, of course, he was only being placa-
tory. One can remember only too well
those who said that skirts would not
rise more than two inches above the
knee. Once an insidious trend starts
there is no turning back.
People simply do not realise what
could happen to this city. We are in-
domitable tie wearers. Among old-
school ties the most determined are
Melbourne Grammar, Scotch College,
and perhaps Geelong Grammar, in that
order. Among clubs, the Old Mel-
burnians and the Naval and Military
are equally determined. Indeed, it is
rumored that some Old Melburnians
and Naval and Military Club gentle-
men even wear their ties in the bath. In
the old days only such outfits as the
Queen’s Own Royal Staffordshire
Yeomanry, or perhaps the Old Ton-
brigians had ties, now every outfit has
them, Qantas, TAA, Royal Mel-
bourne Hospital, the Alfred Hospital,
Department of Supply, good grief, even
the Gas and Fuel Corporation has a

A Company’s history is normally of great interest only to veteran shareholders, ex-employees and
perhaps, investment analysts.
The true significance of a progressive Company revolves around its management stability* its
planning flexibility, its product depth.
Until about 3 years ago, George Hudson was generally recognized as a timber specialist. Timber
milling; Timber importing; Timber retailing. Essentially a family Company, it had a reputation for
service and for specialist trade knowledge.
Nothing more. But equally, nothing less.
Today this has broadened. True, timber retailing outlets are still there. But today they are entire
service centres to the building trade. True, the mills are still there. But today they have been updated
with modern plant and production methods.
Management and staff have benefited from the Company’s traditional skills which have been adapted
to meet the Building Industry's changing conditions. A carefully-planned diversification programme
has resulted in a series of sophisticated products and services.
The impetus of modern management has added new dimensions to the Company's horizons.
New policies, new products, new processes—these represent the significance of the new GH symbol.
A symbol of broader-based service for George Hudspn clients throughout Australia.

Fraser. The role of the Strapper was
important. It went thus:
Big Noter: How did I go today,
Fred?
Strapper: Absolutely terrific. Your
style was superb. You killed ’em.
That sort of thing kept a Big Noter
going.
How are these people to survive?
No doubt it could be possible for the
Naval and Military Club and the Old
Melburnians to have Old Boys’
skivvies. Or perhaps they could wear
their ties underneath. One time your
correspondent spotted a gentleman at
the South Australia Hotel dining in a
skivvy, Had the famous Lewy fallen
down on his job? So one mentioned
this to a junior waiter and he replied:
“It is quite all right, sir. I understand
that the gentleman is wearing a tie
under his turtle-neck.
So you see it is the principle that
matters, as long as a man can prove
that he conforms.

SOME QUICK
CENSORING OF THE
CHINESE BOOKS
NO ONE IS suggesting that anyone
would come to the University of New
South Wales Book Fair with the idea
of stealing anything, but, on the other
hand, ab-so-lu-tely no one goes through
that door with a bag. Mrs. Deirdre
Bromham, one of the U-Ball Com-
mittee members running this Fair with
other academic wives, is here to see
they don t. A khaki-shirted
student slips by the waiting masses with
an enormous all-leather, all-purpose
briefcase. Would he mind very much,
says Mrs. Bromham, who leaps from
behind her counter with unsuspected
agility, would he mind handing it over?
The thing is, all libraries have this
rule. At Fisher Library they even ask
you to remove your shoes.
Anyway, everyone’s waiting im-
patiently at Unisearch House, which
was once a bowling alley and is now
an examination room, to buy some
beautiful book bargains. They hope.
There is a great deal of cynical
observation as to whether they will.
Behind the closed glass doors 40 or
so ladies with name tabs on their
bosoms take up allotted stations. lialf
a dozen are roped off outside Gentle-
men’s Cloaks with adding machines
borrowed from Statistics. Two guard
cashboxes. “They are the Adders and
Takers,” explains Professor Reuter,
whose wife, Irene, is chairman of the
committee. The idea is for people to
help themselves, like a supermarket, and
the professor, who seems to know a
thing or two about shopping, says if
the Takers had to add at the same
time they would go mad. He is pacing
the floor rather nervously. Well, it’s a
bit different from Food Technology,
his normal subject.
At exactly three o’clock an academic
wife opens the doors and everyone
surges in. NO SMOKING and NO
EATING say two printed notices, so
out come the cigarettes and snacks to
aid concentration. There are trestle

mittee...“not and never will be

tables groaning with books, 50,000 of
them, all categorised, and a promise of
FRESH SUPPLIES DAILY. It has
taken the committee a year to collect,
sort, and price them, a task they per-
formed in a basement room in the
bowels of Chancery. Ladies in Chancery,
everyone called them. Someone did ask
Angus and Robertson, the bookselling
people, if they could assist with pric-
ing, but they were too busy. Today,
however, they are here buying. Mrs.
Reuter says she was very surprised
when their carrier arrived and said
he’d come for A and R’s books.
The big rush is for heady subjects

and hands it round. She hopes her
husband will bring in some Chinese
food later on, but the outlook is not
too promising. Anyway, the point of
the fair is to raise money for the new
University International House which is
opening in May. It is also to show Mel-
bourne that N.S.W. can run as good a
Book Fair as they did without being
social. “We are not, and never will be,
social,” says Mrs. Reuter, with some
feeling.
“All I feel like saying is ‘shiver me
timbers,’ ” pipes up Lady Baxter, the
Vice-Chancellor’s wife, cocooned in
Mrs. Reuter’s suede coat over her own
raincoat and dress. Someone has
switched the air-conditioning on. She
also adds if someone offered $lOO for
her stuffed yellow paisley bookworm,
which is leaning against Hogarth’s
Works, complete with mortar-board
and brown woollen beard, she wouldn’t
say no.
Then, sotto voce, she thought some
of the books were priced too high, so
she has gone round and quietly altered
them.

Emotional security
in the Indian Ocean?
COMMENT
BY
“OBSERVER”
DOES THE Indian Ocean matter? Or
to put it another way what does the
Indian Ocean mean ? The questions are
worth asking because some of the Aus-
tralians who concern themselves with
possible strategic policies for Australia
in a world without Britain are now
beginning to worry about a gap to our
West as well as to our North.
There is a limit to one’s list of
worries. Should the Indian Ocean be
on it at all? Or, if it should, is there
anything Australia can do about it?
There is one usage of the Indian
Ocean as a strategic concept that seems
plain nonsense. This is the idea that
you collect all the major international
problems of the land masses that make
up the two sides and the top of the
Indian Ocean’s boundaries and then
gum them together as if they added
up to a common strategic concept.
This tour of the Indian Ocean’s
horizons usually begins with South
Africa, then passes on to the Portuguese
colonial war in Mozambique. It con-
templates the instabilities and tensions
of Tanzania, Kenya, and Somali;
worries for a while about Chinese and
Russian influence there; then crosses
the Red Sea and worries about what’s
going to happen in the Arabian
peninsula following the British pull-
out. It then pauses between India and
Pakistan to concern itself with the
tensions between these two nations;
it moves into India itself and worries
about the clash between India and
China; it passes to Burma, and has
another worry about China; then
stumbles across some of the dominoes
of South-East Asia, and comes back
home via Indonesia.
The worries that this tour encom-
passes are real enough. They provide
a summary of the main points on any
sensible person’s problem list. But
what brings them together as a strategic
concept? Why is there some special
interaction between them that comes
from the fact that the same ocean
washes their shores? Is there any
special relationship between what mat-
ters in Burma and what matters in
Mozambique, or what matters in
Indonesia and what matters in South
Africa?
To say that there is a special relation-
ship betwoen the problems of these
various countries seems as sensible as
saying that there is a special relation-
ship between the problems of Peru and
Korea because both countries adjoin
the Pacific Ocean, or between Belgium
and Mongolia because both countries
belong to the same land mass.
Is the Indian Ocean a “region”? Of
course not. It’s just a lot of water,
arbitrarily labelled “Indian Ocean”
(except by ex-President Sukarno, who
thought of it as the Indonesian Ocean).
What matters in South Africa or
Mozambique or East Africa or the
Arabian peninsula or the Indian sub-
continent is of general interest to Aus-
tralia because Australia is part of the
world; but no special interest comes to
us from the fact that we share the per-
ipheries of an ocean with these
countries.
The only interest in an ocean is that
some particular naval power might
dominate it. Then the interest is in the
ocean itself, not in the land masses that
adjoin it, except in so far as they pro-
vide naval bases. But except for a
general war, naval domination of an
ocean is of no particular interest. In
times of peace, what does it matter
which power has the most naval vessels
sailing around the Indian Ocean? We
are no longer in the 16th century.
Russian privateers are not likely to
board the Marconi or the Orcades and
carry into captivity their precious
cargoes of Australian tourists. Nor are
we still in the 18th century when, by
having naval forces deployed around
the world, you might be able to knock
off one or two of an enemy’s distant
colonies if you had declared war on
it back home.
It is true that if there were another
world war it would matter to Australia
who commanded the seas, although in
a nuclear war even this might not
matter much. But “the seas” in this
sense are not just one ocean. “The
seas” are the arena of world naval
power and there is nothing that Aus-
tralia can do to affect world naval
strength. Navies are quickly transferable
from one ocean to the other and par-
ticular strength in a particular ocean
at a particular time is not necessarily
significant with one exception, and
that is the question of naval and air
bases. It is hard for a major naval
power to transfer strength from one
ocean to another if it hasn’t got any
bases to work from.
Given this, it would seem prudent
for the Australian Government to start
the process of making up its mind
about whether it will establish a naval
base at Cockburn Sound. If it decides
against Cockburn Sound it should find
some other site. At the same time the
Government should make a decision
about establishing an air base at
Exmouth Gulf. One hopes that both
these projects would finally prove to
be a waste of money, but it seems
sensible to have some bases on the
Indian Ocean if for no other reason
than that they could come in useful to
a major ally if it wanted to transfer

power to the Indian Ocean. If the
Australian Government had not
dithered with these proposals for so
long it is just possible that they might
have made some marginal difference to
the British pull-out east of Suez. If
we want our allies to continue to show
an interest in Australia’s security we
can hardly expect them to build bases
in Australia for us.
But beyond that, what? In a non-
nuclear world war Australia would
either be on the side of a major naval
power, or it would be out of the game.
The Indian Ocean used to have a par-
ticular importance to us because we
sent our expeditions across it, and
because our oil came from across it.
Neither of these factors will again
apply. If, in a major war, our major
allies were weaker in naval strength
in the Indian Ocean than the Pacific
Ocean (and this would happen through
a decision about the allocation of their
resources) then we would have to use
the Pacific Ocean rather than the
Indian Ocean. This would not matter
at all.
Among the Liberal MPs, although
fortunately among the backbenchers
rather than in the Cabinet, there is a
small group that still sees the Indian
Ocean in terms of some other war in
some other time. Some of them see
its future as more important to Aus-
tralia than the future of our neighbors
in South-East Asia. Lost in the old
world of naval power, before there
were air forces and IBMs, and perhaps
also thankfully rebelling against the
idea that we should really have any-
thing to do with South-East Asian coun-
tries, they want both to get out of
South-East Asia altogether (hereby per-
haps wrecking our alliance with
America) and—of all things— enter in
an alliance with South Africa.
Their policies seem to come from a
craving for emotional security rather
than from a concern for strategic
security. From a strategic point of view,
an Australian alliance across the Indian
Ocean with South Africa would be
about as useful to us as an alliance with
that other great historic neighbor of
ours, separated from us only by the
Pacific Ocean, the Republic of Peru. If
we were going to go in for old white-
dominion nostalgia, an alliance with
Canada would make more sense, since
Canada’s economic strength is five
times that of South Africa but what
is the use of talking about it?
The South Africans would like to con
Australia into some demonstration of
affection. Their reasons are obvious.
There is something in it for them.
Except to a few white-dominion fun-
damentalists in Australia there seems
no point in showing how disastrous to
Australia such a mesalliance would be.
There should be no attempts to fall
back on old familiarities. The old
familiarities have gone for ever. There
should, instead, be a seizing on circum-
stances to show leadership to the Aus-
tralian people in a new sense of being.

AUSTRALIA
Why the leadership struggle
solves nothing for the ALP
Gough Whitlam. .. operating uneasily
Jim Cairns ... threat always present
By ALAN REID
FOR SOME YEARS there have really
been two Labor Parties, two almost
opposed political groupings, operating
under the common label of the ALP.
The votes on the various ALP bodies
tend to confirm this viewpoint, and
no manipulation in the personnel of
the leadership can change the situation
though it could have an effect upon
the outcome and decide which of the
two groups will emerge victorious, and
the official owners of the coveted label
of “Official Labor.”
Basically the conflict is ideological.'
It arises out of opposed attitudes on
foreign affairs and Communism. One
group wants a “hardline” stand on
foreign affairs and no tolerance of
Communists. The opposing group
wants to detach Australia from what
it considers the “hardline” of United
States global policy, particularly as it
has manifested itself in Vietnam.
Placing Communism next to the ALP
in the political spectrum, this group
is inclined to view it as a reforming
influence within the body politic.
There are complicating factors, of
course. One is sectarianism. Because
Roman Catholics are inclined to take
“hardline” attitudes on these issues
and because the Democratic Labor
Party has a strong Catholic base,
especially in Victoria, where it has its
largest strength, Catholics are suspect.
The case of Mr. R. B. Harradine,
the Tasmanian Federal ALP executive
member who was debarred admission
to that body’s deliberations on the
ground that he accused the Victorian
ALP executive of being under “sub-
stantial” Communist influence, is an
illustration of how the sectarian factor
is used. Harradine’s document was an
answer to an anonymous document
that, in a seeming irrelevancy,
solemnly recorded that Harradine was
trained for the Catholic priesthood at
a South Australian seminary.
But this was not really irrelevant
within the context of the Labor power
struggle. South Australia is not as
clearcut in its ideological attitudes as
the Left-wing Victoria and Queens-
land. Neither (now) is Western Aus-
tralia. But while not so clearcut in
their ideological lines as Victoria and
Queensland, South Australia and Wes-
tern Australia are suspicious of the
Irish-Catholic influence. Revealing that
Harradine was trained for the priest-
hood had a psychological effect. It
hardened South Australian and Western
Australian opposition to N.S.W., prob-
ably the solitary remaining citadel of
Irish-Catholic ALP power, and Tas-
mania, allied to N.S.W. because of its
desire to retain its Labor Government
by identifying itself with the “mod-
erate” forces within the ALP.
Although these overtones of
sectarianism and parochialism can be
exploited to change the numbers
marginally on ALP bodies, in ALP
leagues, in electoral councils, and within
unions, on ideological lines the division
is almost even, and the closer you get
to the grassroots of the Labor move-
ment the more even it becomes.
Within the Federal Parliamentary
Labor Party, the division is almost
exactly equal. When personalities are
not involved, the Caucus on questions
with an ideological content divides
almost as equally as other ALP bodies.
The margin on this type of issue is
seldom larger than four or five—not
much in a Caucus numbering 70.
Labor has always, throughout its
turbulent history, found room for a
wide range of thought and ideas. But its
strength has been that a clear majority
has held thoughts and ideas in common,
which has enabled the Party to tolerate
the discordant ideas and thoughts of
its minorities with reasonable good
nature and resignation.
But the situation now is that there is
no clear majority. The split seems to
go straight down the centre, dividing
the Party in two almost equal halves.
This week’s leadership struggle solves
nothing. At best, two parties will con-
tinue operating uneasily under a
common label. At worst, the divisions
could grow wider, with the threat
always present that the two groups will
separate into distinctive and official
political groupings.


The A.C.T.
Limits of advice
CANBERRA’S ONLY elected body
.suspended operations last week because
of continued political frustration. But,
before it did so, the Australian Capital
Territory Advisory Council—created to
advise and submit recommendations to
the Minister for the Interior—got the
present Minister, Peter Nixon, squarely
in its sights and blasted him with a
couple of thousand words which left
little doubt of what it thought of him
or his administration of the A.C.T.
This statement, adopted at the last
meeting of the Council, last Monday,
had been circulated to mass media
three hours earlier—yet Peter Nixon
first learnt of it when he opened the
“Canberra Times” next morning.
There is nothing new about the
A.C.T. Advisory Council’s feud with
Nixon...headon collision
Ministers for the Interior. It has been
on for many years and with many
Ministers. But Peter Nixon, a compara-
tive newcomer to the portfolio, col-
lided head on with the Council’s ambi-
tion for more powers —part and parcel
of the ambition of a majority of the
elected members to ultimately force
political acknowledgement that the
Council would be the nucleus of self-
government in the Territory.
Whether the majority of the 50,000
voters in the A.C.T. share this view and
would support such a move is doubtful.
Most of them come from interstate and
are fully conversant with the financial
pitfalls of self-government compared
with the benefits of the bottomless finan-
cial purse from which the Common-
wealth Government continually pours
funds for Canberra’s development.
But Peter Nixon, anxious to succeed,
has now promised to speed up an inves-
tigation currently underway within his
Department into possible self-govern-
ment for the A.C.T. He still has not re-
plied to the Council’s blast that, among
other things, maintains his attitude is
“stand pat and static.” Until he does,
the Council has declared it will not
meet.
Nixon’s terse rejection of five resolu-
tions submitted by the Council since
last October precipitated the present
showdown. The Council, as part of its
campaign for power and prestige
(which it definitely has not got now, as
emphasised by the election to the
Council last year of Canberra
columnist Alan Fitzgerald, who ran as
a “True Whig” candidate on a promise
to do nothing), asked for these rights:
To examine and comment on all
A.C.T. legislation before it was promul-
gated. To direct the Minister to
appoint a Board of Inquiry under the
inquiry ordinance. To advise directly
Ministers responsible for matters affect-
ing the A.C.T. other than the Minister
for the Interior. To be represented at
inquiries conducted by the Government
affecting A.C.T. residents. And to
be able to make direct representations
to the Parliamentary Joint Committee
on the A.C.T.
Nixon declared what the Council
wanted was in fact power without
responsibility—“it is seeking a role in
the executive, legislative, and adminis-
trative functions for which it shares no
responsibility” . . . “The cause of self-
government is not helped by the kind
of proposals which seek to change the
locus of decision-making without intro-
ducing the basic elements of political
and parliamentary responsibility.”
He has promised a reply to the
Council’s new outburst “within a week
or so.” While drafting it, he is sup-
posed to remember the Advisory
Council’s final warning: “In the absence
of any positive indication that addi-
tional responsibility will be given to it,
the Council will feel obliged to con-
sider its future role as an advisory
body and what other steps it should
take.”
ECAFE
Question of worth
ALTHOUGH IT backfired, a Soviet
Union attempt to turn the 24th session
of the United Nations Economic Com-
mission for Asia and the Far East into
a political forum last week did at least
enliven an otherwise very dull affair.
Essentially a public relations exercise,
ECAFE’s annual meetings rarely pro-
duce anything new. The conference
itself is little more than window dress-
ing for ECAFE’s real work, performed
by a small hard-core secretariat com-
posed mainly of seconded United
Nations experts based in Bangkok, and
even as window dressing the confer-
ence was hardly a success. There is
no debate—only a seemingly never end-
ing series of repetitive prepared
speeches. No votes are taken because
decisions are arrived at, as executive-
Russia’s delegation ... surprise
warning
secretary U Nyun pointed out “in the
Asian way”—by consensus.
The 1968 meeting took eight days to
arrive at its first concrete (?) decision
—a nebulously worded resolution urg-
ing the United Nations to provide the
region with more funds and calling for
“greater mobilisation of resources.”
The secretariat will decide just how
the resources are to be mobilised.
ECAFE may, again in U Nyun’s words,
be “action orientated.” But the
speeches certainly were not. Instead of
preparing blueprints for a brave new
Asian world, delegates were unanimous
in pointing out only what has already
been done—and how the rich nations
were not doing their share.
Even Russia’s attack on the West pro-
vided little that was new—the Vietnam
War was denounced as American aggres-
sion, and the Asian and Pacific Council
(ASPAC) and the Association of South-
East Asian Nations (ASEAN) described
as front groups for external powers
which were sinisterly planning to turn
the organisations into military blocs
similar to ANZUS and SEAT'O. The
American denials were equally pre-
dictable, though most observers were a
little surprised when five Asian nations
—Thailand, Nationalist China, the
Philippines, Korea, and Indonesia
particularly, hit back with a warning
that such remarks would “cost Russia
whatever affection it still has in the
region.”
More surprising was the fact that
other nations, less hostile to the U.S.S.R.
did not rally behind the Soviet flag.
But the storm passed over in a matter
of hours, and the conference returned
to Asia’s justified, though hardly new,
fears of falling commodity prices and
trade barriers hampering Asian exports.
Last August the Federal Government
set aside $lOO,OOO for this year’s confer-
ence. But when fares, accommodation,
transport costs, entertainment, and lost
working time are taken into account,
the true cost would probably be more
like $1 million. One might be excused
for wondering whether the plenary ses-
sions are really worth while, or
whether it would be better to leave the
secretariat to continue drawing up pro-
grams, sifting through development pro-
jects, and asking for more UN money
directly without the costly and seem-
ingly pointless 12-day annual meetings.
And perhaps the member Governments
could channel the funds they pay on
meetings into the real work of giving
Asia true economic viability.


Railways
Track record
LAYMEN WHO have watched subur-
ban track-layers hammering in the
spikes, or who, as children, have jumped
from sleeper to sleeper, would hardly
recognise the Mount Newman rail pro-
ject as part of the same world. The
Bft. 6in. jarrah and wandoo sleepers
are laid only 18in. apart to carry the
1321 b.-per-yard BHP railway line, which
in turn will carry ore trains just under
one mile long. They are laid along
with fishtail plates and two spikes to
hold them in position by a machine
developed on the site, which moves
along at walking pace setting down the
huge pieces of timber like lollysticks in
a confectionery factory.
On the 265 miles from Port Hedland
to Mount Whaleback in the Pilbara
region, the track-layers must stay above
1.3 miles a day to be on schedule, hav-
ing the line finished by March next
year. They are regularly putting down
two miles plus 200 yards of steel daily.
And, according to young American Mr.
Joe Fearon, superintendent of track-
laying, his team is planning to lay more
than four miles of track on one day
’“just to prove it can be done.”
The sleepers are laid directly on to
the earth. But by this time several oper-
ations, from the original bulldozer to
the water crew, have made the
cinnamon-red earth surface as hard as
pavement, and within an inch of the
surveyor’s line. This plain links one of
the world’s oldest land masses with the
still-forming coral islands off the coast.
The tremendous run-off from the mon-
soonal rains that have recently finished
takes the red soil across the floodplain.
At this time of the year, the plain
carries a greenish fuzz, but most months
It is red, hard, and dry. Although there
are three ranges between Port Hedland
and the mine, the Hamersleys and the
Ophthalmia Range are skirted, and the
railway cuts only through the Chichester
Range which, at its highest, is only
300 ft. above the Fortescue Valley
behind it. So it is virtually a downhill
Laying sleepers at walking pace
run from Mount Whaleback, at 1800 ft.,
to the port.
The steel is stockpiled at the Hedland
end where the 36ft. lengths of track are
forged together into quarter-mile
strings, then laid eight pairs at a time
on the top of trucks and taken to the
“steel-head” where the track-layers are
at work. Here the strings of steel are
rolled over the tops of the trucks, down
a boom, and on to the sleepers. This job
is done by a team of 50 Thursday
Islanders who have had experience with
similar jobs in Queensland and on
the transcontinental route.
When the track is down, it is pinned
at one in every five sleepers by a man
with a jackhammer, and the rest is
done automatically. There are half a
dozen operations which involve dump-
ing ballast on the line, agitating it to lift
the track plumb with the surveyors’
pegs, and then lining up the job elec-
tronically. The last machine along
squares off the blue-metal ballast and
finally sweeps it clean.
The actual track-laying is done at a
1-1 J mph rate, so going to four miles
a day would not be restricted by this
part of the job but by the backing-up
services, which make big logistics prob-
lems. The track-layers are keen to give
it a go, headed by Joe Fearon, a 31-
year-old Maine railroad man who
started in the business (like his father
and all his uncles) when he was 12, as
a callboy. Already rates are at or close
to world records; to go to four miles a
day would certainly give Australia
another world record.
Queensland Labor
The anger tree
THE LAUGHTER of waiting reporters
drifted up the lime-green staircase of
the Builders Labourers’ Federation’s
aged building in Brisbane’s Fortitude
Valley on April 22. They had been
waiting since 10 o’clock in the morn-
ing and as the evening rush hour began
they had resorted to cracking a few
old chestnuts. But in the room at the
top there was little humor. Federated
Miscellaneous Workers’ Union’s Fred
Whitby had just declared that the
choice was between “The Whitlam
Labor Party” and “The Australian
Labor Party.” During his speech he
glared angrily at MHR for Brisbane,
Manfred Cross, as if challenging him
to declare openly that he supported
the Federal Opposition Leader.
The full Queensland Central Execu-
tive of the Australian Labor Party was
meeting, and they had come to bury
Whitlam; not to praise him.
Trades Hall members of the QCE
were widely critical of Mr. Whitlam in
backing Tasmania’s Mr. Harradine. As
one executive member said: “Gough has
backed the wrong horse; the only way
out of this mess is for Harradine to
apologise.” Queensland secretary of
the Party, Tom Burns, put it even
more strongly: “Harradine says he is a
good and loyal member; if he is, he will
withdraw his attack on the Party.”
At first reading, it appeared that
Mr. Whitlam had lost heavily in
Queensland. The QCE announced that
it “recognises the Federal Executive
as a properly constituted Labor body,”
and “In accordance with the consti-
tution and rules we fully endorse its
actions at its meeting from April 17
to 21. We appeal to all sections of
the Party to work within the frame-
work and accept the decisions of its
authorities.” The QCE said that
the Federal Executive was “competent
to handle present matters” and it
resolved to oppose Mr. Whitlam’s move
for a special Federal conference on the
issue.
Burns was beaming after the meet-
ing. He went on television to say that
he “didn’t know what” was in Mr.
Whitlam’s mind. Then he softened
his line of attack and added that be-
cause the ALP is a democratic in-
stitution there would always be fights.
In the Trades Hall there were signs
of lasting bitterness, even greater than
after Whitlam’s “witless men” com-
ment. “One man has blown the guts
out of the party; we didn’t start it,”
said one Trades Hall member of the
QCE.
Before the Federal Executive meet-
ing, the Queensland branch leaders had
indicated that they would not support
a stand against the Victorian execu-
tive. One said that State autonomy had
to be jealously protected and any at-
tempt to interfere with it would only
create anger. And anger is the fruit

on the Queensland Labor tree at the
moment.
It would not have been lessened
when, later in the week, the AWU
no friend of State Labor in Queens-
land dispatched a telegram to
Harradine from its Sydney head-
quarters, ending with, “you had the
guts to say what many Labor suppor-
ters believe true.”
But Whitlam wasn’t the only politi-
cal bird having his wings clipped. The
QCE also set up a joint liaison com-
mittee chaired by State Opposition
Leader Jack Houston with equal mem-

cipal Labor caucuses to review all
rr t. i
matters affecting the caucuses. It also
urged the Municipal Labor Party in
Brisbane to completely review all pro-
posed new Brisbane City Council or-
dinances and “ensure that the control
and authority to act on behalf of the
citizens of Brisbane are left in the
hands of the duly elected representa-
tives.” This was easily interpreted as

Cotton-growing
From sideliner to problem industry
"‘POLITICIANS just love dams. With
great fanfare they build the blasted
things and then leave it to us to see
if we can find something for them to
use the water on.” So complained a
public servant in Canberra last week.
Right now they are trying to work
out what on earth can sensibly be
grown at two dams the Commonwealth
Government committed itself to just
before the last elections in November.
How to make some degree of economic
sense out of the $lOO million handout
to Western Australian and Queensland
which the late Mr. Harold Holt pushed
through Cabinet to help the Govern-
ment’s election prospects in two States.
Cotton is usually spoken of as the
main income-earner in both the Ord
and Emerald schemes. But the Govern-
ment is now in the middle of a
major appraisal of the economic via-
bility of cottongrowing in Australia.
The immediate reason for this is that
the current arrangements providing a
bounty-fund of $4 million a year for
helping cottongrowers have come to an
Keepit Dam area cotton ... but will
the subsidy go on?
end. New legislation is required this
year if assistance to cottongrowers is
to continue, and the growers must know
before they prepare ground for the 1969
crop. July is the deadline for an
announcement of future cotton policy.
At this stage the Bureau of Agricul-
tural Economics has about a dozen of
its officers many well-qualified
agricultural scientists and economists —
preparing a full-scale report on the
state of the industry and its future
prospects. From that report, which
should be in draft late this month, the
Department of Primary Industry will
be making recommendations on policy.
Today, cotton is quite a different
industry from that surveyed when
present arrangements were legislated in
1963. Then it was an old-fashioned and
unimportant thing, mostly in the hands
of a smattering of graziers and wheat-
men who put in 25 acres or so, who
planted irregular dryland varieties and
employed hand-pickers. National pro-
duction was around 8000 bales, valued
in total at less than $1 million. Pro-
ductivity was lower than almost any-
where in the world. And significantly
for the Department of Trade and
Industry and Country Party leader
McEwen it went nowhere near satisfy-
ing domestic requirements of cotton
fibre, which were around the 100,000
bale figure.
A use had to be found for water
from the Keepit Dam on the Namoi
River and the small dam on the Ord
was going in, and State Agricultural
Department and CSIRO research in
both places had reported that based
on irrigation cotton was technically a
goer.
With that the $4 million subsidy
was legislated. The result was remark-
able, better described as the creation
of a new cotton industry than a trans-
formation of the old. Today, the posi-
tion is that over 100,000 bales are be-
ing produced each year, on highly
mechanised irrigation farms, with yields
as good as the most efficient of other
countries. Production per acre has in-
creased sixfold in five years, and acre-
age has doubled. Dryland cotton-
growing as a sideline for Queenslanders
has given way to broad-acre mechanised
production on the irrigated river-flats
of the Ord, the Namoi, and the Mur-
rumbidgee.
But what of the future? This year
for the first time Australian cotton-
growers are supplying the entire needs
of local spinning mills. Local usage
grows at snail’s pace, one or two per-
cent a year. Future expansion of
cotton must be based either on forced-
pace expansion of the cotton manufac-
turing industry or else on exports of
cotton fibre. The first would only be
possible behind greatly heightened
tariff barriers; those barriers are already
generously high for local manufacturers.
Our Asian trading partners as well
as Australian consumers would be most
unhappy about further rises. The Tariff
Board in most of its reports has sug-
gested a lowering rather than a raising
of levels of protection for the local
cotton textile industry. So, for the
time being, there is not much likelihood
that expanded markets for cotton fibre
will be found at home, though in time
the cotton interests involved might be
able to buy more protection if the
Country Party and the Trade Depart-
ment are still under the present man-
agement.
The second possible outlet for extra
cotton is in exports. But again the
prospects are not particularly bright.
World consumption of cotton has been
virtually stationary since 1960, mainly
because of substitution by synthetics.
Cotton has been knocked much harder
than wool.
China, India, Pakistan, Egypt, and
the Sudan are all increasing their pro-
duction, and these, plus the selling-off
of the American stockpile, have been
forcing prices steadily down, so that
today they are around 20c a pound,
compared to 30c to 35c in the late
’fifties.
The expansion of production in poor
countries seems assured on account of
their desperation-for foreign exchange,
so that is one large bearish factor in
future cotton trading. The impact of
American price support for cotton (they
subsidise their cottongrowers about as
much as we subsidise ours) is difficult
to judge. A liberal and internationalist
CORRECTION
IN THE BULLETIN of April 27 an
item appeared about Mr. Jim Fraser,
MHR for the A.C.T. The item
recounted an anecdote about a CQn-
stituent who failed to get official help
to remove a dead cat from outside his
house and. who called on Mr. Fraser
for help. The story suggested that Mr.
Fraser removed the cat himself and
buried it. Mr. Fraser points out that
when he approached a government
department on the matter, it was co-
operative. Also, he says he drives a
seven-year-old Studebaker, not a
Mercedes and that it was not a cat,
but a dog.

At the Best Stores
America would tend to reduce its
domestic subsidies and reduce local
consumption to give poor countries a
chance of getting a reasonable price on
world markets. But this could be done
only at considerable domestic cost in
terms of diversifying the farming of
the American South and shifting liter-
ally hundreds of thousands of share-
farmers out of cottongrowing. With
the trend of American politics increas-
ingly self-centred, and the dollar under
pressure, the likelihood of major cur-
tailments of U.S. exports of cotton
looks small. The U.S., too, will prob-
ably remain a bearish factor in the
world cotton market.
It is one thing for the Common-
wealth Government to pay a 40 per-
cent subsidy to rural industry which is
substituting a local product for im-
ports, but entirely another for it to
provide the same subsidy when that in-
dustry looks like becoming a major
exporter, especially if long-term price
prospects on world markets look bad.
There is no doubt that on present
returns cottongrowers will continue to
expand production and that inevitably
an export surplus will arise. Over the
next three years production will most
likely rise as yields per acre on the
existing Ord farms are improved. In
addition, one of the best potential
cotton areas is on the Macquarie River
in New South Wales below the large
Burrendong Dam, which is just com-
pleted. This is such a huge water
storage that it could provide the water
for a cotton industry, as large as that
already established on the Namoi, and
provide plenty of stockwater for
graziers as well.
In two or three years’ time, the
present prices being maintained by sub-
sidy, there would be an export surplus,
probably of at least 30,000 bales. That
will be costly enough to taxpayers
(about $lO million) but moderate com-
pared to what can be expected once
the Senate elections $lOO million hand-
out for the Ord and Emerald schemes
bears its unsaleable fruits.
Treasury officials in Canberra
groaned last week when they heard
the news that the Western Australian
Government had found a way to build
an even bigger dam at the Ord with
the money it is getting. All that extra
damned cotton to subsidise and pro-
tect, they exclaimed.
The prospect which is really worry-
ing people in Canberra is the prospect
looming up when the Ord and the
Emerald are completed in 1972. These
have the capacity to add as much as
half a million bales to the national
crop, creating a problem larger in
magnitude than that of the dairy in-
dustry today. Direct subsidies by
bounty would be in the region of $3O
million to $4O million. Unlike the
position in dairying, the cottongrowers
would almost certainly get a variety of
indirect subsidies as well: dirt-cheap
water, heavily subsidised transport,
bounties on inputs and special finance
for housing, machinery, and land prep-
aration. And the market prospects for
cotton look even grimmer than for but-
ter, exacerbating the difficulties of sub-
stituting profitable forms of production.
The predictions in Canberra are that
what will probably happen is that some
sort of compromise will be worked out.
The subsidy being requested by cotton-
growers (eight cents a pound) will not
be granted. The Australian taxpayers
simply cannot be asked to support the
huge, lame industry which this would
create. The guessing is that three or
four cents will be granted, or perhaps
a subsidy which starts at the present
(and requested) levels and drops by a
cent a year. Cotton interests will prob-
ably be able to pressure the Govern-
ment into forms of indirect subsidy by
increasing tariff protection on cotton
textiles.
We’ll end up with about half a dairy
problem. As with the Fill project,
the Government has landed itself, by
electoral expediency, with a huge white
elephant in the Ord and a lesser one
in the Emerald, and the best it can
now do is try to minimise the continu-
ing costs of sustaining them.
Cereals are the most likely alternative
.crops in the cotton areas: sorghum, rice,
and corn. If farmers were free to
grow rice on the Namoi and the Mac-
quarie Rivers in N.S.W. they would
almost immediately switch away from
cotton, and if the right varieties were
available they might do the same thing
at the Ord. But corn and sorghum
offer the most promising alternatives to
cotton, since there has been a dramatic
increase in world trade in stockfeeds.
The world’s rural growth industry is
factory-farming of cattle, pigs, and
poultry; and the Common Market,
Britain, and, most of all, Japan are
going in for it in a very big way. To
quote some exemplary figures, the Jap-
anese poultry population has trebled in
the last decade and the number of pigs
quadrupled. West European and Jap-
anese imports of sorghum and corn
were 7.7 m. tons in 1955-6. Last year
they were 32.2 m. Prices have been
rising.
So far we have let American farmers
take all the profit from this big new
business. Wool Board chairman Sir
William Gunn (not foolish enough to
put his money in fibres) is one of the
few Australians going into sorghums,
and he plans to have 150,000 acres in
several years’ time.
Officials in the Department of
National Development who are enthu-
siasts for the Ord scheme admit now
that it will probably not make financial
sense as a cottongrowing area but
think of it as a giant source of stock-
feed, not only for export but also for
a modernised cattle industry in the
Kimberleys.
The difficulty as yet is that existing
strains of grain sorghum do not yield
highly enough to pay as a principal
crop, but by the late ’seventies they
may if sufficient research effort is put
into breeding new varieties.


OVERSEAS
Humphrey, hope of the
side —and the South
EVERYBODY IS familiar with the
drawbacks of the Vice-Presidency of
the United States as a post for an active
politician. In its favor, there is one
thing to be said: it is, unless Senator
Eugene McCarthy should prove the
contrary, the only known way for a
poor man to attain the Presidency. For
more than three downhill years Vice-
President Hubert Humphrey has per-
formed the unpleasant chore of giving
political support to the President, the
one positive function inseparable from
his office, with every outward sign of
relish. Never has self-abnegation been
more ebulliently done.
Much of the liberal and progressive
following that he used to command
as a Senator has left him, although he
still has much appeal for the older
trade union leaders; the rest of his
following is now divided between Sen-
ator McCarthy and Senator Robert
Kennedy.
Four months of party strife lies
ahead, with Mr. Humphrey the only
man to carry the Johnson standard.
Governor Connally, of Texas, Gov-
ernor McKeithen, of Lousiana, and the
other Southern conservative Democrats
must feel rather like Kent in “King
Lear”: “I have seen better faces in my
time than stands on any shoulder that I
see before me at this instant.” It is
a bizarre turn of fate that has made
Mr. Humphrey the hope of the South
and the hope of Party unity. It was
he who forced the Democrat conven-
tion in 1948 to adopt a strong Negro
rights policy, thus causing the Dixiecrat
secession led by Mr. Stram Thurmond.
Mr. Humphrey’s stupendous efforts as
majority whip got the Civil Rights Act
of 1964 through the Senate against
strenuous Southern opposition. The
pressure on President Johnson in that
year to take Mr. Humphrey as his Vice-
President, when his personal preference
seemed to lie elsewhere, came from the
sections of the Party that wanted the
Texan President to be balanced by a
northern progressive of internationalist
outlook and strong principles on civil
rights. As recently as 1966 Mr. Humph-
rey threw the people who see the Negro
ghetto as a police problem into a fury
by saying that, if he were forced to live
“with rats nibbling on my children’s
toes” as so many Negroes were, “I might
lead a mighty good revolt myself.” In
the 1964 campaign the Party in Louis-
iana kept his name off its election
literature and did not dare ask him in
to speak.
All that has been changed. The
number of Southern States where a
respectable man can safely advocate
concessions to Negroes has grown with
the years. Mr. Humphrey, while he
has not dropped his principles on civil
rights, has learnt to recommend the
virtues of maturity (at 56 he is the
oldest of the three Democratic con-
tenders) and unity in the Party and
the nation. But, above all, the thought
of Senator Kennedy, the dynamic
Attorney-General of four years ago, as
President is more than Southern flesh
and blood can bear. Mr. Humphrey
can now tour the South in triumph,
advocating Negro rights into the
bargain: his appearance in Louisiana
recently brought out the entire local
Party hierarchy to cheer. Getting the
support of the Southern delegations at
the convention presents no problem for
Mr. Humphrey.
The Vice-President’s problem is a
different one: how much of the old
Humphrey following can he recover?
Local politicians are sophisticated
enough to understand that during his
years in the Vice-Presidential cage he
had no choice but to support President
Johnson’s policies. The trouble has
been his tendency to overdo it. His
public advocacy of the policy on the
Vietnam War that has led the Demo-
crat Party into such a pass has been
more Johnsonian than the President’s.
Mr. Humphrey, nothing if not warm,
has always been a man whom other
men could love and follow. Some of
his old friends have sought desperately
for a sign that had he been President
he might have acted differently, but
they have never got anything from him
but the appearance of total conviction
that the Vietnamese policy has been
right from beginning to end. Perhaps
it is not Mr. Humphrey who has
changed but the feeling of the liberal
community.
Mr. Humphrey remains a man of
great qualities and great achievements.
His chances of the nomination look
better now than they did in the few
days following President Johnson’s with-
drawal. Hanoi’s unexpectedly favorable
initial response to the President’s gesture
deprived Senator McCarthy and Senator
Kennedy, if only temporarily, of their
main issue, the Vietnam War. The
Humphrey conferring last week with
one-time track star Jesse Owens on
improving youth opportunity programs
President’s act of self-abnegation has
even swung a lot of sympathies back to
him. Thus Mr. McCarthy and Mr.
Kennedy have both suffered a tem-
porary loss of momentum and Mr.
Humphrey has won a breathing-space.
Mr. Kennedy still appears the stronger:
but a chance does exist for Mr.
Humphrey to rally the centre of the
Party in the name of continuity and
unity.
Britain
The facts in black
and white
DID MR. ENOCH POWELL, in his
speech about colored immigrants to
Britain, get some of his figures wrong?
And did he draw the wrong implica-
tions from them?
For instance, Mr. Powell suggested
that the immigrant population “must
be in the region of five to seven mil-
lion by the year 2000,” yet an
“Economist” Intelligence Unit estimate
made in 1963 calculated that it might
be three million by that year, given a
net intake of 42,000 per annum in a
total population for the country of 70
million.
At present the colored immigrant
population numbers roughly 820,000,
or fewer than two residents in every
hundred. In determining the pressure


Dockers outside Parliament on Friday
Powell and his wife leaving church
Dockers say “Back Britain, not black Britain”
on services that can be attributed to
colored immigrants, the numbers of
other incomers from the Common-
wealth and elsewhere have to be con-
sidered. There are now 60,000 Cypriots
in Britain, 30,000 Maltese, 60,000 Aus-
tralians and New Zealanders, 60,000
Canadians. About 500,000 have arrived
from the Republic of Ireland alone
sincp 1945, and there are perhaps
200,000 immigrants of fairly recent
origin from Eastern Europe and else-
where.
All these groups inevitably increase
pressure on the social services while —
like the colored immigrants—making
their own contribution to the economy.
Employers in the wide range of indus-
tries in which immigrants wxirk do not
see Mr. Powell’s idea of encouraging
re-emigration as at all realistic. Most
came at a time w’hen an expanding
British economy needed them, and that,
employers say, is still the case.
Immigrants are vital to the economy,
says the Confederation of British
Industry, stressing that they have far
wuder skills than is often supposed.
Building, engineering, and heavy
foundry wmrk to a high degree depend
on immigrant workers. So do many
menial, but essential, jobs that whites
do not care for. The cotton industry’s
revived fortunes wmuld not have been
possible without the ready supply of
Asians in the north. Night shifts in
many Yorkshire textile mills are largely
manned by Pakistanis. Foundries,
which demand heavy work in hot con-
ditions, would be lost without colored
workers.
Because the immigrants’ presence has
been shown to be necessary in several
important sectors of the economy,
officials experienced in race relations
find it hard to see in what w'ay re-
emigration could be “encouraged.”
Many city transport services could now r
hardly manage without them, nor
could the post office. It has been
estimated that one-fifth of the bus
drivers and conductors in Birmingham
and London are colored.
The question of the supposed “extra
strain on the national health service”
caused by immigrants is again one
with two sides to it. Mr. Powell stated
that “Britons . . . found their wives
unable to obtain hospital beds in child-
birth.” In a sample of some of the
more immigrant-prone areas, no Medi-
cal Officer of Health was ready to say
that any jvhite mother had been de-
nied a maternity bed for a first baby
because of overcrowding, though there
might have been cases in which they
had to have their second and third con-
finements at home, which is usual pro-
cedure in normal cases.
It is true that colored immigrants
probably make more individual de-
mands on the Health Service than their
white counterparts. This is partly be-
cause they do not know how to work
the system and because of language
difficulties. This can make a consulta-
tion twice as long—and a white patient
would probably go to a chemist for
something that an immigrant would
consult a. doctor about.
At the same time, if colored medical
staffs accepted Mr. Powell’s invitation
to “re-emigrate” there would be no
Health Service. Nearly half the junior
doctors in the hospitals are colored,
so are about 20 percent of trainee
nurses and midwives.
There continues to be an element
of economic exploitation of immi-
grants. The Confederation of British
Industry is uncomfortably aware that
a good many of its members make
immigrant workers welcome because,
on the whole, they are cheaper to
employ and that they will sometimes
accept working conditions which, in
the case of a white, would provoke
union action. There is a degree of
sweated labor in the midlands and the
north, where most of the factories that
employ more coloreds than whites are
to be found.
But the CBI is at pains to nail the
myth that colored workers take jobs
that would otherwise be done by the
indigenous population. It is pointed out
that the areas which have the largest
unemployment figures, the north-east
and Scotland, have fewer Common-
wealth immigrants than most other
areas.
The Ministry of Labor does not
keep statistical track of the number
of immigrant workers and their distri-
bution through industry—“ This has
always been the policy.”
But Ministry employment offices in
areas where the immigrant population
is heaviest are able to make estimates
for their own locality. This is to keep
a balance between the races in certain
factories and workshops. Employers
tend to have quota systems especi-
ally for unskilled jobs.
Meanwhile, amid the flood of pub-
licity for Mr. Powell’s supporters, the
public opinion polls continue to show
a clear but small majority of the people
in favor of the general principles of
the Government Race Relations Bill.
Gallup, in Thursday’s “Daily Tele-
graph,” recorded 42 percent on the
whole in favor of the Bill, 29 percent
on the whole against, and 29 percent
don’t knows. Certainly . there were
majorities against making it an offence
to discriminate on racial grounds in
granting jobs and selling property.
But the Pow'ellite minority is not the
voice of Britain.
South Vietnam
Balking peace
THE PROSPECT of peace talks has
opened up a serious rift between the
American military authorities and the
South Vietnamese Government. Presi-
dent Thieu has a reputation for occa-
sional shows of independence, but these
are becoming more common, and seem
designed to make it more difficult for
the Americans to enter peace talks
from a position of strength.
An announcement by the South Viet-
namese Government that a North Viet-
namese Colonel Pham Van Thach,
the highest - ranking officer ever to
defect, had given them information that
four North Vietnamese regiments were
preparing to pounce on Saigon near
May Day annoyed General Westmore-
land.
' The United States military com-
mand said it already knew of the threat


but was keeping quiet about it in the
hope of surprising the advancing Com-
munist forces.
A farcical situation arose, with the
American command denying there was
any special alert in Saigon while the
South Vietnamese were deliberately
building up the tension.
President Thieu’s line of reasoning
appeared to be that the Americans
were less likely to agree on a peace
talks site if everybody knew Saigon
was threatened and American troops
were in difficulties in the north.
In most parts of Vietnam the military
stalemate is openly admitted. “We
have the town, they have the country-
side,” said an Army lieutenant on the
road to Duch Hua, north of Saigon.
“We move freely during the day but at
5 p.m. we hand the road over to the
Viet Cong. It works quite well. “We
never have any trouble, and during the
day this road is as safe as Central
Park.”
But the tacit truce does not extend
to recruiting. Both sides are doubling
their efforts in anticipation of battles
to come.
But President Thieu will be lucky
to reach his target of 35,000 extra men
by September. Major Nguyen Phu,
commanding officer of the Quang
Trung reception centre, 15 miles north-
east of Saigon, the largest in Vietnam,
admits that so far this year nearly
10,000 draftees, or one-third of the
total draft, have failed to turn up for
military duties.
Faced with growing differences with
the Americans, President Thieu is
pushing ahead with the “Vietnamisa-
tion"’ of the war. As from May all
South Vietnamese recruits were to be
channelled into the regional forces in-
stead of the National Army (ARVN).
These forces are under the com-
mand of the province chiefs, who are
in turn appointed by Thieu, and so
can be built up into a purely South
Vietnamese fighting force, unlike the
ARVN, who, on the whole, tend to
follow their American advisers’ advice.
Burma’s General Ne Win and Mrs. Win (centre), at a State banquet in honor of their
four-day State visit to Singapore, with Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew and Mrs. Lee
Singapore-Malaysia
Burma dialogue
THIS TIME it was Burma’s Head of
State, General Ne Win, for whom the
Malaysia-Singapore ceremonial guns
barked. But as the General departed
on Sunday it would seem that the signi-
ficance of his visits lay merely in the
fact that they had been made.
Naturally there has been speculation
that Ne Win had something more in
mind. With the Burmese economy still
languishing very much in the doldrums,
Burma having slid down the list of rice
exporting countries she once always
headed, and with China last year
appearing less and less willing to respect
Burmese neutrality, it is calculated that
the Burmese military may be edging
toward abandoning the isolation which
has of late accompanied the neutralism.
Having made some limited purchases of
American arms, according to some
sources via Japan, it is thought that
Ne Win’s visit here betokened a willing-
ness to come closer with those less
heavily non-aligned than himself —and
maybe join ASEAN to boot.
During the eight-day stay, first in
Singapore and then in Malaysia, the
Burmese leader gave absolutely no
indication that he shared such thoughts.
The few words he spoke publicly—and
evidently those uttered privately—sug-
gested to the contrary that nothing had
changed.
Thus in Singapore at a State ban-
quet Ne Win reiterated Burma’s hope
for “the kind of South-East Asia in
which every nation would be free to
live . its own life in its own way,” a
statement seeming to circumscribe
heavily the extent to which “it would be
to our mutual benefit for our two coun-
tries to develop close relationship and
co-operation.” On the subject of
how such co-operative relations could
be made more tangible, the General
said nothing.
Nevertheless, the dialogue now started
—Malaysia’s Tunku Abdul Rahman will
probably visit Rangoon next month, and
his deputy, Tun Razak, and Singapore’s
Prime Minister, Lee Kuan Yew, have
already been there could lead some-
where in the long run, perhaps even to
ASEAN membership, though, as the
Tunku pointed out last week, the cur-
rent state of Malaysia-Filipino relations
scarcely encourages hopes of ASEAN
itself enduring.
Westerners are not alone in wonder-
ing whether isolationist neutrality is the
best answer to a vexed problem.
“In South-East Asia today,” the
General said in Singapore, “there are
powerful forces at work—forces which
have their origin in countries of the
region and forces which have their
origin outside the region . . . Though
the conflict between the forces from
outside the region casts its shadows over
the political scene, we in Burma believe
that ultimately only the forces of the
region will prevail and play a decisive
role in determining the kind of South-
East Asia we shall have to live in.”
In two long editorials this week the
Malaysia-Singapore English-language
newspaper, the “Eastern Sun”—which
tends to voice opinions and emotions
widely held, albeit not at the moment
by those in power here—generally sup-
ported Ne Win’s view. On Monday it
maintained that alignment with big
powers is “a shortsighted and un-
realistic view,” and that South-East
Asian countries “should strike out on
their own and cut the umbilical cords
that tie them to the big powers.” On
Friday it dubbed Ne Win’s neutralism
“a realistic policy for emerging
nations” and pointed out how often
regional distrust is engendered by big-
power tie-ups.
Significantly in both editorials, the
“Eastern Sun” exempted an ANZAC
military presence in Malaysia-Singapore
on the grounds that Indonesia accepts
it “Such understanding will con-
tribute to regional peace” but the
arguments the paper presented for
emulating Burma’s non-involvement
could conceivably be heard more fre-
quently in the months and years ahead.
New Zealand
Labor at work
NEW ZEALAND Labor movement
conferences this and next week meet
in a climate of increased social and
economic stress for the unions but of
electoral hope for the political wing.
Unemployment this winter will be
worse than it has been since the de-
pression ’thirties. Devaluation and price
increases, removal of food subsidies,
Government deflation measures, and


employer organisations’ attempt at a
wage freeze have hit the man in the
street and are the issues which will
dominate the Federation of Labor con-
fen nce this week.
Disenchantment with the National
Government’s administration, respon-
sible in electors’ minds for the hard
times, will rebound to Labor’s advan-
tage. The Party’s public display at its
conference next week will be watched
anxiously by those wondering what sort
of alternative Labor would provide
should it gain Treasury benches in
1969.
Labor Party initiative is only partly
affected by union attitudes. But that
limitation is on emphatic public dis-
play, thanks to the proximity of the two
conferences.
The National Party is under great
farming pressure but is more subtle in
obscuring the relationship. Alongside
the disenchantment of some unionists
that Labor is not ideologically pure are
other feelings that tolerance and unity
are necessary. The two conferences will
show which view has the stronger hold.
Vietnam could be divisive. To the
anti-Vietnam War protestor in Labor
and union ranks, the leadership seems
to be soft-pedalling its withdrawal
policy. The Labor leadership say the
Party’s policy is the same as before and
therefore need not be repeated. But
some delegates plan to try to force the
leadership to reaffirm withdrawal of all
N.Z. troops.
Labor needs to present a forthright
leadership image to a sceptical public
whose hesitancy about the Party springs
largely from doubts about Labor cab-
inet material.
The leadership problem lies in
encouraging unions not only to diminish
friction with the Party but also to
encourage them to give Labor the
greater financial and electoral support
it needs. Sixty percent of unions are
affiliated to the Labor Party. Among
prominent unionists who show little
initiative or enthusiasm in their rela-
tionship with it is Tom Skinner, Federa-
tion of Labor president. Skinner poli-
tically is sandwiched between Left and
Right. Fie faces his first challenge for
the presidency since he took over five
years ago. Although unlikely to be
defeated, he will face dissension over
domestic issues. Research, badly needed
by both Labor wings, could be im-
proved for both with greater political
harmony and financial resources. It
could be improved for the unions
by greater leadership from Skinner. The
cry this time will be for Skinner and
FOL National Executive to speed
modernisation of the unions by increas-
ing ancillary services.
Very old men and women who w'ere
radicals in the ’thirties are the conserva-
tives of the political and industrial
wings today. Young and middle-aged
unionists are waiting in the union wings
to change directions. Still younger men
and women are pushing from below' in
the political wing. One sign of this is
that one-third of the issues to be raised
this time come from youth and univer-
sity branches.
Canada
Young man's fancy
“IT’S SPRING,” proclaimed the cam-
paign buttons worn by Mr. Trudeau’s
supporters when he surprised Canada
and himself by emerging as Mr. Lester
Pearson’s successor. Apt words.
Canadians wanted among other
things the promise of change from
a young man with vigorous new ideas.
So April 20 saw Mr. Trudeau sworn in
as Prime Minister, and in three days
he dissolved Parliament in the belief
that general elections in June, with
all this wind in his sails, will bring
his Party the clear majority it never
won during Mr. Pearson’s five difficult
years in office.
But one spring doesn’t make a sum-
mer. In this first year of confederated
Canada’s second century, 20 million
Canadians cannot just sit back and ad-
mire their new wonder boy in calm
confidence that all will now go swim-
mingly. The Liberals did not choose
Mr. Trudeau because they simply
wanted to live dangerously and thought
it would be le fun a mart to entrust
their fate to a colorful, brilliant, but
still unfamiliar character. (He burst
upon the national scene so recently
that it was suggested at one point in
his hectically brief campaign that
there should be buttons saying: “Pierre
Elliott Who?”) They chose him as the
man best fitted to cope with a situation
whose dangers are at last being fully
recognised.
What about Quebec? Nobody should
assume that the mere fact of Mr.
Trudeau being a French Canadian intel-
lectual from Montreal means that his
Ministry can count on the co-opera-
tion of the Quebec provincial Govern-
ment, or even on that of the Quebec
Liberal Party. As to the separatists,
they are now just cranking up for the
next stage in the struggle. The day
after Mr. Trudeau took office, Mr.
Rene Levesque’s Mouvement Souver-
ainete-Association decided to become a
political party with the declared aim
of drawing Quebec’s splintered
separatist factions together in a more
formidable grouping than French
Canada has yet known. The day after
that, Mr. Johnson’s Minister of Educa-
tion, Mr. Cardinal, sat down defiantly
in Paris at a conference of French-
speaking countries whose French hosts
accorded to Quebec —not to Canada,
which was not invited—as full a parti-
cipating status as they gave to the
sovereign States represented.
In his farewell address to his Party,
Mr. Pearson spoke bluntly of “an
organised movement to destroy . . .
national unity,” and gave warning that:
“It could happen here: separation and
break-up. There are some—on each
extreme of narrowness and bigotry—
who would make it happen.”
The next stage in this struggle is
likely to call for a certain ruthlessness
of which Mr. Trudeau seems much
more capable than Mr. Pearson ever
was. He may, on the other hand, have
to adopt some of his predecessor’s
diplomatic use of language. He may
choose not to get into a head-on fight
with General de Gaulle over such affairs
as Mr. Cardinal’s Paris jaunt until he
is ready for battle —by which time the
challengers in both Paris and Quebec
City may have thought better of it. But
he must certainly do battle before long
not only with the declared separatists
in Quebec but also with their counter-
parts in places ranging from Nova
Scotia to British Columbia.
Some of his initial statements have
tended to give the impression that he
wants to withdraw Canada from inter-
national involvement in order to get
its domestic problems properly sorted
out. In actual fact Mr. Trudeau’s in-
stincts and his record are as interna-
tionalist as Mr. Pearson’s. Any
Canadian Prime Minister would, in
present circumstances, have to give
first place to the struggle for national
unitv.
New Canadian Prime Minister Trudeau ...“one spring doesn’t make a summer”


What makes Australia laugh?
By DENIS O'BRIEN
The Garnett family of television’s “Till Death Us Do Part”...
a big laugh
Roy “Mo” Rene...a basic laugh
David Frost...a minority laugh
Jack Davey. . .Australian radio’s last laugh
AT A TIME when it seems that noth-
ing very funny is happening on the
way to Armageddon, the loss of three
highly prized F-11l bombers on their
first operational flight over Vietnam
is a laugh. Not a joke (although the
preoccupation with the expensive vir-
tues of the F-11l has the beginnings
of a joke) nor even everyone’s laugh;
but it is a cause of laughter springing
from the two main sources of humor
—tragedy and someone else’s adversity.
In this case, the cynical and the con-
fused could laugh defensively at the
whole tragedy of Vietnam as repre-
sented by technology’s failure, and the
apathetic could laugh at government
and bureaucracy slipping on a banana
skin.
The incident did generate short,
speculative, and sometimes bitter
laughter among the Australian conver-
sational routine; that it died there
without breeding embellishments is
significant. Vietnam, like Korea before
it, is an almost humorless war. Bob
Hope might visit the troops and spray
them with environmental wisecracks,
but emotionalism is running too high at
home for any comic to risk a routine
on the ideological clash. No one yet is
hanging any washing on the DMZ
line; Ho Chi Minh is nothing like as
absurd as Hitler or Mussolini.
On the theory that laughter grows
out 0 f tragedy the whole world should
b e convulsed. Just about every inci-
dence of conflict or violence, need or
greed is now catalogued by news media
with such round-the-clock conscientious-
ness that laughter becomes an almost
necessary defence for the confused
intellect against the flood of it all.
How else can we gain time to get a
perspective on (or understand) terror-
ism in Aden, student thuggery in Ber-
lin, and political intrigue in Athens?
Yet humor has to push for a place
in the Press and not many are
employed by newspapers, TV, and
radio to stand apart and chuckle at
the world taking itself so seriously,
United States columnist Art Buchwald
is one, but he has his work cut out
just trying to reduce the. Washington
political scene to sensible proportions.
Beyond Buchwald’s range and
certainly in Australia the influences
seem to be all for getting us to strap
ourselves in for a collision, whether
we’re on a collision course or not.
While each of us might have his private
intellectual joke about the pressure of
our international and social respon-
sibilities, to laugh it out loud frequently
is to hear it killed by polemics,
But still we laugh. Probably not as
much as we did 30, or even 20 years
ago, although that can only be offered
as a theory based on the comparative
lack of abrasive conflict and struggle
in the Australian way of life today;


the lack of a real impetus to make us
battle a situation with laughter. The
problems that are pushed at us day
by day mostly originate outside our
boundaries and often are beyond our
intellectual scope; they attract our feel-
ings of concern and sometimes,
remotely, of despair and are sufficient
to sober us to an unsmiling view of
an unluckier world around us. But
the very nature of the Australian good
life the comfortable affluence and
our almost complacent acceptance of
it strangely deprives us of the basic
sources of laughter. Rich substitutes
seem to elude us.
Australia developed an indigenous
sense of humor through the battlers
and larrikins characterised by “Banjo”
Paterson, Henry Lawson, Steele Rudd,
and C. J. Dennis. The “good bloke”
constantly at war with the boss and
the harsh environment, the larrikins
who had a go and invariably came
out on top, the Everyman battler who
was as much a hero as a source of
amusement, the yarn which democratic-
ally levelled everything and everybody
and made a virtue of toughness, blunt-
ness, roughness, and social awkwardness
. . . these were the salt and pepper
of a genuine Australian humor which
helped a nation compensate for raw
adversity.
Australians were encouraged to laugh
at the battler and the larrikin until
about the time that “Smith’s Weekly”
died in 1950, although by then Austra-
lian humor already was becoming more
urbanised. Strains of the bloke joke
and the bush yarn still survive in such
random examples as Joliff’s cartoons
for “Australasian Post” and Frank
Hardy’s Billy Borker tales, but the
breed is withering for lack of culti-
vation. Australian humor today is very
much the humor of the United States
and Britain particularly Britain
with an occasional “good on yer, mate”
tagline to remind us that the gag,
though foreign in origin, has an Aus-
tralian relationship.
Working at the job of being funny
(ha-ha) is a funny (peculiar) occupa-
tion in Australia. There’s a loud and
constant scream for material, but Aus-
tralia doesn’t really encourage the
comic or humorist socially or finan-
cially.
Commerce and industry traditionally
have never encouraged a robust sense
of humor as prerequisite for promotion.
Business is a serious business; the public
service is always good for a laugh—
unless you work there. Today, with
business handing over the responsibility
for much of its executive personnel
selection to the sifting machinery of
management consultants, the jolly
joker or witty wisecracker always
held in suspicion by top management
is more likely to laugh himself out
of executive selection than the fellow
who takes the IQ test seriously.
A Sydney journalist who applied
last year for a senior public-relations
post with a large Australian company
recalls with awe his encounter with
the firm of management consultants
appointed to screen all applicants for
the job.
“Their earnestness was frightening,”
he says. “I was first taken to a cell-
like office containing a desk and two
chairs; I took one, and a young woman
who bustled in carrying the IQ test
paraphernalia sat facing me. She ex-
plained the test, gave me a sample run-
through, and then said, ‘Now, I shall
go to the door here, say aloud One-
two-three-GO, and you will begin the
first part of the test as I press my
stopwatch. I will then leave the room,
but as soon as I reappear at the door
you will stop writing and put down
your pen.’ The unsmiling formality of
it all was too much for me. The test
George Wallace Jr...last traces
of the Strine laugh
Steptoe and Son...a seamy laugh
looked like so much nonsense and didn’t
seem to have anything to do with my
credentials or what the job I was
after entailed. I made some mildly
funny wisecrack about not leaving me
alone too long, but it dropped to the
floor with a thud; the woman didn’t
even field it. Half an hour later I was
interviewed by some personnel
psychologist who said, ‘I understand
you find our little test amusing. Tell
me, what are some of the things that
make you laugh?’ I told him the
Goons, Hancock, Perelman, Lennie
Lower at his best. He sat there stonily,
and almost impulsively I began to tell
some half-remembered joke to vali-
date my sense of humor. At that
moment I knew how comedians feel
when their jokes die. I’m glad to say
I didn’t get the job.”
Perhaps it has always paid to laugh
at the boss’ jokes rather than crack
your own, but Dick Thompson, a
Sydney University lecturer in social
psychology, sees the development of
what he calls the “organisation-man
syndrome” beginning to suppress the
individual values in laughter.
“The man who stands off and
laughs at his company, his job re-
stores his sense of independence, but
comes to see it as a precarious inde-
pendence,” says Thompson. “There is
a tendency for the organisation man
to look to society for his values rather
than make his own. That’s one reason
why Kingsley Amis’ ‘Lucky Jim’ was
so popular: there was vicarious satis-
faction in identifying with Lucky Jim
laughing and clowning against conven-
tions and somehow succeeding. There’s
a latent Lucky Jim in every business.”
Sometimes, the office wit is funnier
than anything on television (they keep
telling him), but making comedy stand
up and bark for a living in Australia
these days is unfunnily difficult. It
competes with, and is judged against,
the heavily financed imported pro-
duct; it flounders in its attempts for
a distinctive identity; it isn’t, by
foreign comparison, handsomely paid.
In the post-war laughter market, only
author John O’Grady has made the
sort of money that allows the humorist
to laugh all the way to the bank.
O’Grady’s success rests largely on one
book, “They’re a Weird Mob,” which
has sold close to 500,000 copies in
hardback and paperback and is still
selling. If there’s a clue to O’Grady’s
triumph it’s surely that he presented
the Australian as a 1950 s version of
the Lawson-roughcut.
Television is almost certainly the
main source of public laughter in Aus-
tralia today; it has been since the
first of Lucille Ball’s American half-
hours introduced us to the canned
laugh the Pavlovian trick of con-
ditioned responses in 1956. (It is
fascinating to think of using the same
technique for drama. For instance,
would a thriller gain by having a
sound-track dubbed with gasps and the
chatter of teeth?)
Comedy invariably rates among the
Top Ten programs around Australia.
The substantial humor of such early
shows as “I Love Lucy” and “Sergeant
Bilko” attracted immense audiences
and gave America a firm grip on the
Aussie funnybone. Dick Van Dyke
tightened the grip, but public prefer-
ence began to swing toward British


humor with vintage Hancock. “Steptoe
and Son” and “Till Death Us Do
Part,” for their comparatively short
seasons, have won some of the biggest
laughs of all. The social satire of David
Frost responsible for a major shift
in the trend of English-speaking
humor did not, strangely, draw a
majority response in Australia; Frost’s
latest production, “At Last the 1948
Show,” has had a change of emphasis,
and its reliance on physical jokes
legs falling off, people twitching and
undressing has only a coterie fol-
lowing.
Bruce Gyngell, the chief executive
of TCN Channel 9, says that the bulk
of American situation comedy is pro-
duced by no more than about 12
people, and the best of Britain’s by
about half a dozen. He believes such
production proportions apply to Aus-
Gloria Dawn...a neglected laugh
Lucille Ball ... canned laughs
“At Last the 1948 Show” ... a coterie laugh
tralia’s population of laughmakers.
Yet Australian television has had no
distinguished success in its own
attempts at originating comedy. The
comedy sketches which separate the
singers and sight acts in so many variety
shows are bread and butter for the
dozen or so scripters making a living
out of that area of TV; there is not
much jam. Many comedy-series pro-
grams have been scheduled for produc-
tion in the past 12 years; of the few
that have struggled into public view,
only “The Mavis Bramston Show” and
“My Name’s McGooley” have been
robustly risible. Both derived from a
British trend “Bramston” from the
satire boom exploded by “That Was
The Week That Was,” and “McGooley”
from the seamy pathos of “Steptoe and
Son.”
A comic’s punctuation: Keith
Smith once said, “In the old days
of commercial radio four or five of
us would sit around Jack Davey
and he’d say, ‘OK, I want ten gags
from each of you,’ and we’d fire
them at him bang-bang-bang. In
television if they can’t think of a
gag they say, ‘OK, we’ll play it for
pathos.’ ”
“Bramston” and “McGooley” both
have exhausted the best of their comic
possibilities, if not their sustaining
audiences. “Bramston” still attracts an
average of 200 unsolicited scripts a
week, which proves that the public’s
creative sense of humor is still buoyant.
Also charitable. “Bramston” pays $6O
for a three-minute sketch, $BO for the
lyrics and score of a musical number,
and about $4O for a monologue. By
British and American comedy rates,
such payments are laughable. In Aus-
tralia, it seems to be the price of
comedy.
One of the strangest characteristics
of Australian television comedy is its
preoccupation with homosexuality. As
Melbourne critic Phillip Adams says,
“Homosexuality is funny, provided it’s
on the telly. Off the telly homosexuals
are fit only for being punched up.” The
compulsion to dress up in drag or at
least to posture like a queer sooner or
later seizes nearly every comic appear-
ing on Australian TV. Camp humor is
a flourishing cult. Hugh Stuckey, one
of the dozen or so professional comedy
writers in the country, has just launched
a weekly program in Melbourne which
calls for a troupe of Australian Rules
footballers to sing, dance, and perform
rough comedy sketches dressed in
wrinkled stockings, high-heeled shoes,
and bras made from balloons. Stuckey
also is scripting a long-projected comedy
series for Tony Hancock, for which he
is reported to be getting $4OO a week
—a dizzy sum for an Australian scripter,
but peanuts by comparison with the
money earned by Hancock’s British
scriptwriters, Ray Galton and Alan
Simpson, who were paid the equivalent
of $4200 a show for their work on
“Steptoe and Son.”
In perpetuating the slapstick of cam-
perie as it does, Australian TV coinci-
dentally helps to sustain vestigial traces
of a traditional Strine style of comedy,
founded in knockabout vaudeville and
echoing memories of Roy Rene, Jim
Gerald, and George Wallace Sr. Some-
where in Australia it is still possible to
look at a TV screen and see Buster
Fiddes contorting his spontaneously
funny face through a routine which is
old fashioned but amusing still. Even
Graham Kennedy, whose slick wit now
draws laughter more from habit than
conviction, clutches at the vaudeville
sketch for some of his “In Melbourne
Tonight” comedy.
And in Queensland a loyal Brisbane
audience continues to support the
comic antiquities of George Wallace Jr.
in a program which derives from the
vaudeville of the city’s now defunct
Theatre Royal and which doggedly
carries that name. Wallace represents
one of the few remaining links with a
bygone style of Australian comedy. He
has exhausted the potentialities of at
least a dozen local writers, few of whom
have been able to survive in his con-
text for very long. He now writes all
of his own material. With the aid of
his visual technique, some of it is
most interestingly amusing.
Commercial radio has totally yielded
its sponsorship of original comedy. The
comic momentum of George Foster,
Willie Fennell, Mo, Keith Smith, and
A 1 Thomas began to limp with the
onset of television and stopped alto-
gether with the death of Jack Davey.
It was simple, basic humor with a
heavy Australian accent. Against the
early competition of “Lucy” and
“Bilko” it stood no chance on TV.
Radio’s last major comic eruption was
made by the Goons in the middle to
late ’fifties: memorable and magnifi-
cently surreal comedy which had some
of its noises and catchwords grabbed
for public conversation. Fame! There
is an impressive permanency about
Goonery: it still stands up strong when
revived on record. Of it, Spike Milli-
gan, its inspiring genius, once said:
“The laughs come from making the
impossible happen. Everyone has his
fantasies, and if you make them seem
real you produce laughter. But how-
ever crazy things might seem there
always had to be a good logical reason
behind it. If you were driving a bed-
stead to the Himalayas it might be


because a Scots mattress manufacturer
had offered £lOOO to the first person
to drive a bedstead up Mt. Everest
and plant a flag on the top saying ‘Mc-
Gill’s mattresses are best.’ People will
do anything for money.”
Radio today sounds off loudly with
oracular commentators and talkback
programs but not with a great deal of
humorous entertainment. Sometimes
there are jerky sniggers for a few of
the talkback chairmen John Laws
in Sydney for his sharp and self-
esteeming wit, and Max Harris in
Adelaide for his mannered sententious-
ness and the sheer difficulty in trying
to reconcile him with talkback radio;
mostly, though, this form of program-
ming inhibits public laughter because its
übiquity is an oppressive reminder of
the bloodiness of life and the pettiness
of personal problems. It reflects a
suburbia wallowing in self-pity which is
just not true.
In the sprawling western and southern
suburbs of Sydney are some of the
readiest belly laughs in Australia,
belched out with happy unselfconscious-
ness at the basic humor and low
comedy regularly offered in the social
clubs and paid for by poker machines.
At the St. George Leagues Club
the Taj Mahal of such establishments
between 400 and 600 people a night
recently were convulsed for a season
by Mike and Bernie Winters, a couple
of English stand-up comedians unknown
in Australia except through one short
and spotty TV series. Their double-
act was only barely removed from the
“I say, I say, I say” of 1930 music
hall; it relied heavily on anal double
ententes and oral double-takes; it
contained many of the symbols of John
Osborne’s Archie Rice decadence
yet it survived gustily.
Comics’ punctuation: “All right,
then what do you know about
Red China?” “Red China, Red
China? Well, I know it looks nice
on a white tablecloth.” “Aagh!
You’re impossible. And where did
you get that terrible suit?” “You
like it, do you? I got this since I
arrived in Australia; it’s virgin
wool.” “Virgin wool? How do you
get that?” “Well, you have to
catch the sheep that runs fastest.”
If the Winters brothers had come
equipped with custard pies, they would
have thrown them, too. And brought
the house down. The fact that their
professional reputations meant nothing
to their audience proved the uni-
versality of their comic appeal and
their type of comedy. It never really
dies. A well-aimed custard pie gag is
always a favorite candidate for the
biggest laugh anywhere.
But Australia is strangely hard on its
own stand-up comedians, offering more
sympathetic support to the imports.
Also, Australia has produced no new-
style cerebral comics, such as Mort
Sahl, Alan Sherman, Shelley Berman,
Elaine May and Mike Nichols, all
of whom strike responses here. Perhaps
the underdevelopment of sophisticated
comedy here is because of the lack of
a nightclub sub-culture of sufficient size
to sustain it. Poker machines virtually
are all that the Leagues Clubs and Las
Vegas have in common.
Only Sydney’s Joe Martin stands as
a synonym for Australian sophisticated
comedy of the nightclub genre. He has
been successfully working the limited
outlets around Australia for more than
20 years, and is more popularly funny
now than he has ever been. By slightly
adjusting his routines he can attract
just as many lowbrow laughs as he can
from people who like their humor
pitched slightly higher; there hasn’t
been an area for comedy in which he
hasn’t stood. He feels he’s beginning to
run out of areas.
“Performing comedy in Australia is
uncommonly tough,” he says. “Because
an audience gets to know you well, they
sometimes imagine they know every
John O’Grady (with Walter Chiari and Clare Dunne) ... from
the book “They’re a Weird Mob,” a long, rich laugh
joke in your repertoire. They’re apt to
judge you by an American comedian
who can work his routines around a
much wider audience. I move my humor
with the generation of the day, yet I’ve
found that the Australian public likes
its humor to be basic.
“I really need to get away from Aus-
tralia for a while. It’s very important
for a comedian to be exposed to
different environments. I’ve worked in
Britain and Europe, and America, too.
I’ve got offers to work Asia, South
Africa, and Canada, but America is
where it really counts to me. I was
doing well last time I was there, and
then my work permit expired. That’s
the problem over there. I often think
that if we made it as difficult for
American comics to work in Australia
we might develop more of our own.”
Writers of humorous booths don’t face
such barriers, not that many of them
have had telling success on foreign
markets. John O’Grady is a notable ex-
ception. He has had modestly good
sales overseas. Most post-war attempts
to put Australian humor between hard
and soft covers haven’t had impressive
results. Ure Smith report steady sales of
the 47 titles they’ve put into their
Humorbooks paperback library since
1964, but the Australian and New Zea-
land titles among them have a curiously
middle-aged sense of humor. Angus and
Robertson say that their steadiest sellers
in the humor category are Lennie
Lower’s “Here’s Luck” and Chic Sales’
“The Specialist.”
In the magazine market, enough
Australians like their black and white
humor sufficiently broad to keep such
publications as “Gals and Gags,”
“Laughs and Lovelies,” and “Humor
in Uniform” in circulation, while sales
of “Punch,” Britain’s humorous
Establishment, and “Mad Magazine,”
its American polar opposite, are both
diminishing.
Perhaps people are looking less to
print for ready laughter. Certainly the
supply of deliberate humor in the Aus-
tralian Press is becoming short. Ross
Campbell in Sydney, Kirwan Ward in
Perth, and (occasionally) Alan Fitz-
gerald in Canberra are the best of a
very few columnists employed to help
make Australia laugh. Ray Taylor con-
tributes some occasionally amusing
pieces, but his chippy bitterness too
often disconcerts the rising laugh. Barry
Humphries is becoming passe both as
a humorous writer and a Mrs. Everage
performer. As was pointed out in the
One More Week” section of this
magazine the other week, Humphries
is clinging for his comic source to an
Australia which no longer exists,
State by State, there are few notice-
able differences in the tone of the
Australian laugh, although Queensland
and Western Australia seem to rely
more than the other States on fellow-
ship situations for the best of their
laughs,
Queensland even accommodates a so-
called “school of comedy” a ten-
week course of part-time instruction
recently introduced by Brisbane comic
Geoff Gray, aimed more at presentation

techniques than teaching gags. It is dif-
ficult to think of anything as instinctive
as comedy being taught. Gray says
he’s merely hoping to teach funda-
mentals.
A comic’s punctuation: The humor
of the Marx Brothers is almost
universally fundamental. Groucho
Marx once said: “The two biggest
laughs I can recall (other than my
three marriages) were in a vaude-
ville act called ‘Home Again.’ One
was when Zeppo came out from
the wings and announced, ‘Dad,
the garbage man’s here,’ and I
replied, ‘Tell him we don’t want
any.’ The other was when Chico
shook hands with me and said, ‘l’d
like to say goodbye to your wife,’
and I said, ‘Who wouldn’t?’ ”
If Australia is tough on its comedians
it’s tougher still on its comediennes.
They break through with comic in-
ventiveness every few years but sur-
vive only within the confinements of
theatrical revue, which itself is a laugh
factory of doubtful production. Gloria
Dawn has been the queen of Australia’s
comediennes for a decade, but is
neglectfully under-employed.
On the map of sources of laughter,
Australia stands closer to the spare
and dry understatement of Britain
than it does to the fat affluence of
American exaggeration. While we are
moving nearer to Asia economically and
politically, we don’t trade laughs; nor
do we seem to have a common joke.
In the developing union, the one about
the Englishman, the Irishman, and the
Jew might disappear altogether.
Australia laughs, in short bursts, at
the annual Christmas issue of American-
made LP comedy records, although the
laughter begins to echo hollowly with
the 26th playing; no one has that many
friends. There are few laughs left in
Australian-drawn strip cartoons; “Pea-
nuts” and the “Wi/ard of Id” are
modishly funny. Paul Rigby is good for
a giggle; most other Australian cartoon-
ists are required to devote much of
their time to a dramatisation of current
editorial policies, although Tanner still
happily refuses to take life seriously.
Australian politics and politicians are
almost entirely without overt humor
(some, like Arthur Calwell and Andrew
Jones, are sadly amusing) and there is
little incentive to deflate the big shot
by laughing at him because big shots
are no longer big shots just
administrators of incorporated anony-
mities. Undergraduate humor is
pathetic if not non-existent. In the
whole protest movement there’s not a
single laugh.
Speaking personally, I laugh at the
very sight of Britain’s Marty Feldman,
the most grotesque of the resident
lunatics in “At Last the 1948 Show.”
Recently a fan wrote to Feldman:
“Don’t worry that you are not beauti-
ful. God put you in the world for
another purpose.” Spike Milligan says
there’s not a laugh in the Bible, but
someone Up There must have a sense
of humor.


The Aboriginal’s
worst enemy:
the schools
By ANDREW WAKE
If 80 percent of white children fail
white society's "initiation rites/' why
expect Aborigines to pass?
THOSE INTERESTED in the
advancement of the Australian
Aborigine may receive two recent com-
ments with mixed feelings. The new
Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Mr.
Wentworth, opined that the economic
and psychological dependence of the
Aborigine on the white man was not
good for the Aborigine nor for the
later immigrant into Australia the
white European. The chairman of the
Commonwealth Council for Aborigine
Affairs, Dr. Coombs, said that the
Aborigine should not be sheltered from
the need to manage his own affairs.
Both statements are true and use-
ful; the unfortunate aspect is that they
need to be made.
Far too many Australians, some in
responsible positions, still seem to accept
now generally discredited myths of
racial inferiority. There is no biological
reason why the Aborigine of Australia,
or anywhere else, should be unable to
adapt to the technically advanced style
of life found in Australia and else-
where.
However, the inescapable fact re-
mains that most Aborigines, especially
those with little or no European an-
cestry, have not been assimilated nor
integrated into the Australian com-
munity. The reasons for this are ex-
clusively cultural, which is another way
of saying that the Aborigine lives the
way he does because his parents lived
the way they did.
Culture is passed from generation to
generation in the form of language,
religion, myths, legends, hopes, and
fears. Although each new generation
modifies its culture to the changing
circumstances of the time, some atti-
tudes and habits show amazing per-
sistence. In the case of the Aborigine
two features are outstanding. First, his
culture has changed since the arrival of
the First Fleet, but this deviation is a
great deal less than the corresponding
change in the way of life of the des-
cendants of the First Fleeters. .
Most of the reasons for this lie in
the way in which culture is transmitted
from generation to generation. In the
European society there are many and
varied ways of introducing the young
to an increasingly complex society. The
major agents for passing on the tradit-
ions of the society are the home, the
school, the institutionalised religions,
the clubs, societies, and—very impor-
tant in recent years television.
What is left of the purely Aboriginal
culture is today passed on by adults
in the same clan. This culture tends to
be more uniform for any one group
than that of the Europeans. In effect,
every adult of a child’s family group
acts as a sort of instructor in the group
culture. The child is actually given
very little opportunity to deviate from
the common group standards. Although
he may attend a white man’s school, all
the efforts of the well-meaning teachers
to initiate the child into the complexi-
ties of European society may be nulli-
fied by a passing comment from a
highly respected adult in the native
community.
One of the most critical periods in
any person’s life comes at adolescence.
It is at this time that the things of
childhood are put away and the role
of adult must be found. Generally
speaking, in this aspect of cultural trans-
mission, the Aborigine was, and is, much
more successful than the European
society.
In Aboriginal life, the male children
at about 14 years were put through a
series of exacting and often painful
ordeals. At the end of this period, the
child passed over the barrier of in-
fancy and became a fully accepted
member of the adult world, permitted
to share in its privileges and secrets.
The marvellous aspect of this was
that, saving accidents, there was close
to a 100 percent pass rate. That is, all
Aboriginal children eventually became
accepted as first-class adult citizens in
their own community. This does not
happen in white society.
The basic biology of both groups is
identical. Therefore, some time after
the arrival of a child’s first permanent
teeth he is going to be confronted with
the problem of finding an acceptable
adult role that will please both himself
and his associates.
Although we frequently find that boys
model themselves after their fathers and
girls after their mothers, this is by no
means universally so. The majority of
children in Australia, apparently, do not
choose the same occupations as their
parents, but nonetheless tend to stay
fairly closely within the same income
groups.
The means by which this is accom-
plished is an initiation rite which about
50 percent fail. The agency wherein
this somewhat invidious task is accom-
plished is the school.
We all know that a school is where
children go to be taught. Most of us
don’t fully appreciate that there is
little similarity between what is taught
and what is learnt. Generally speaking,,
the teacher thinks that he is passing on
some vital bits of knowledge and skills
that will serve the child well in later
life.
On the other hand, what is actually
being learnt is rarely ever what the
teacher intended. It is hard to tell what
it is that an Australian child learns in
school, but certain things are obvious.
He learns, among other things, how tcv
avoid being defeated in a fight, how to
speak to children of the same age, of
different ages, how to speak to members
of the other sex, how to speak to a
teacher and other adults, how to speak
of a teacher (or other authority) especi-
ally in their absence. He also learns
which games are valued and which are
not, which jokes are funny and which
are not, what is acceptable behaviour for
a child his age and which is not; he
learns the difference between what
adults do and say they do; he prob-
ably also learns how to cheat and not
get caught, how to successfully pretend
innocence or knowledge and, generally,
how to survive in a fiercely competitive
society.
We also know some of the things
he does not learn: he does not learn
to love literature for its own sake; he

Offices in all States
does not learn to love science and
mathematics.
He does not learn to take an active
and intelligent interest in community or
world affairs, nor even does he learn
the thinking processes which have led
to great scientific discoveries.
Most important of all, what the
average child in an Australian school
does learn is that he is not worthy of a
university education; therefore, he can-
not enter any of the professions and
his only chance of fame and fortune lies
in sports or gambling.
All this works reasonably well for the
European community. Even though
Australia has a drop-out and failure rate
in high schools and universities that
would cause a public scandal in Britain
and Canada, this seems to cause no
great hardship here. But the process
whereby this is accomplished causes
great hardship to the segment of the
population that does not share the same
cultural traditions the Aborigine
and, perhaps, some visiting English-
men.
If we closely examine the programs
and syllabuses in use in the junior
secondary schools in Australia, we find
that the adolescent trying to come to
some reasonable assessment of his place
in the real world is expected to spend
most of his time in studying informa-
tion which is valued mostly for its use-
lessness. About one hundred years ago
there was a popular idea in educational
circles that only an advanced type of
mind could handle abstract problems.
Hence the junior secondary curric-
ulum is loaded with abstract ideas and
vague notions that served no earthly
purpose in the past and are less likely
to do so in the future. Consider, if you
please, the real usefulness af being able
to simplify the following expression:
2 (c-3) plus 3 (c-4)
4 ~ 5~
Apparently all teachers in New South
Wales (if not all of Australia) consider
the ability to do this most important,
for it is in the basic maths program for
all first-form children.
Anyone with a little persistence can
make a survey to discover how many
adults use this piece of skill in their
everyday jobs; they may discover that
only one group mathematics teach-
ers does.
The real purpose of this sort of
abstract teaching is based on the cer-
tain knowledge that most 12-year-olds
are not particularly interested in acquir-
ing this skill, and therefore most of
them will not. Thus, at examination
time, only a small percentage of those
sitting will perform well. The teacher
will then selectively grade those who
do as being better students and place
them in the advanced class marked for
eventual arrival at a university. The
majority will be graded as having lesser
ability and placed in an overcrowded
class leading almost certainly to drop-
ping out somewhere in the six-year
course.
The tragedy is that the truly better
student, the one who is more actively
engaged in an intellectual dialogue with
the real world, is going to be rejected
in the process. He, better than his
teachers, realises that algebra has only
limited relevance to the real world.
When teachers start teaching subjects
that have proved themselves useful to
living in society as it is, then we might
find that the Aborigine is just as smart
as anyone in taking advantage of the
opportunities available.
As it is, the schools have insisted
that it is their responsibility to sort,
segregate, and classify children accord-
ing to the abilities considered valuable
by university lecturers who may have
never had any contact with their world.
In brief, the schools have taken on the
task of classifying children somewhat
like eggs, so that prospective employers,
and more particularly university lec-
turers, can choose, cafeteria-style, which
ones they like. Almost universally they
do not like the Aborigine.
There is no reason at all why this
sorting process should be the business
of the school. If the school is intended
to be for the benefit of the child, why
should it be doing positive harm to such
vast numbers, that is, to all children
with contrasting cultural backgrounds?


Disintegrating India
By
G. Ramachandran
Indian Prime Minister Mrs. Indira Gandhi with Soviet
Premier Kosygin and Yugoslav President Tito.
Confrontation over, Indian and Chinese troops come close
together at the Sikkim-Tibet border
IN THE FIVE great States of Northern
India, parliamentary democracy of the
British type is struggling against odds
for survival. From the Punjab in the
west to Bengal in the east, on the level
plains behind more than 1000 miles of
the Himalayan wall that defends India
against Communist China, no really
viable State Government is at present
in power.
In West Bengal and Haryana, local
rule has been suspended and both
States are being administered from
Delhi. The Uttar Pradesh legislature is
under suspension by the Governor, and
if a government isn’t formed soon
president’s rule will be imposed. In the
Punjab and Bihar there are uneasy
coalitions that may topple at a touch.
In Orissa, along the east coast, and
in the mighty southern States of Madras
and Kerala, the Congress Party created
by Nehru has been thrust from power
and has little hope of ever regaining it.
Marxist Communists who lean toward
Peking, and whose aim is assumed to
be violent revolution, now have strong
regional bases in West Bengal, in
Kerala, and in Central India.
There seems to be two major causes
for this condition of affairs. One is the
disintegration of India’s national
political parties. The other is the
absence of any intelligent exercise or
power in Delhi. Every political party,
including Nehru’s Congress, is now
essentially regional in character and is
sustained, wherever it is successful, only
by local urgencies and aspirations.
And although the Prime Minister,
Mrs. Indira Gandhi, angrily insists that
India has never had a stronger
national government, neither Mrs.
Gandhi nor any of her Cabinet col-
leagues—nor indeed any other political
personality—has the real stature of a
national leader.
The nature of the crisis may be
judged by the revolutionary plans now
being seriously advanced to end it. In
a startling speech to the Indian Mer-
chants’ Chamber in Bombay, Mr.
J. R. D. Tata perhaps the greatest
of India’s modern industrialists
lately proposed a complete change in
the nation’s political syste'm. He con-
tended that if India, with its “multi-
multi-party system,” was not to sink
into anarchy, or be ruled by a dic-
tatorship, or cease to exist as a united
nation, then its affairs should be run
by experts.
He proposed a presidential system
of federal government in which a chief
executive in Delhi and executive gov-
ernors in the States would be elected
for a tertn during which they would
be irremovable and free to govern
through Cabinets of experts appointed
by them.
Meanwhile, something like a cam-
paign is being conducted in the Indian
Press for what is described as a “national
government.” This plan is derived fro'm
a vague hope that the mere addition
of numbers from other parties may
lead to an improvement in quality and
diminish the frustration and resent-
ment now dominating the political
atmosphere.
The Tata plan and the national
government are both primarily anti-
Communist. Both sets of Indian Com-
munists, whether they toe the Russian
line or the Chinese, are to be banned.
It will not be easy.
It is, even so, possible that the revolu-
tion-oriented Marxist Communists will
be banned within the next few months.
The Home Minister, Mr. Y. B. Chavan,
is steadily building up a formidable case
against them. It will be much more
difficult to give the same treatment to
the pro-Russian Communist party. This
is not because they are a. large force—•
they are not —but because of the ever-
increasing Russian presence in India.
In almost all India’s State industrial
enterprises, from the production of anti-
biotics to the manufacture of steel,
either the Soviet Union or one of its
East European partners is working in
collaboration with India. Russian
defence equipment steadily pours in.
Russian rocket-carrying ships have
been seen in the harbors of Bombay
and Madras. The Indian Government
points out that visits by foreign warships
to Indian ports are not infrequent.
It must not be assumed that this
development is being received here with
visible alarm. Neither the Americans in
Delhi nor the traditionally pro-Western
political parties of India itself seem in
the least disconcerted. Indeed, some
Indians see in this growing Russian
presence the first —to them promising—
signs of a massive alternative response
to the decline of British-type democracy
here.
This is the joint and benevolent
Russo-American supervision of the
direction of Indian policy. If a con-
vergence of global interest occurs for
the two super powers in India, the
future of this nation may take a bizarre
shape.
But if this stabilising influence is
imaginable, can it hope to be applied
before India itself disintegrates? Will
there .be sufficient time before the
Central Government becomes so weak
that the States will go their different
ways, or before a coercive military
apparatus, with the backing of certain

to hold the nation together?
The task of holding India together
may be too much for Mrs. Gandhi.
She is not likely to get the help pro-
vided for her predecessor, Lai Bahadur
Shastri, by Pakistani-Chinese adven-
turism. And neither her father nor
Shastri had to cope with the present
elemental impact of regionalism.
In the Bombay municipal elections
recently, the chief opposition to Con-
gress came from the Shiv Sena a
political organisation with racialist,
Fascist overtones, which campaigns for
the expulsion of “outsiders.”
The Sena idea has caught on else-
where. Almost every State seems to
have some form of chauvinist body,
run sometimes by unseen hands. Assam
has its Liachit Sena, which lately burnt
down a bazaar in Gauhati, where most
of the traders were “outsiders”—Mar-
waris from Rajasthan and Punjabis.
In Madras, the separatist Dravida
Munnetra Kazhagam has flourished on
Tamil opposition to North Indian Hindi
as the official language. But southern
students now seem to be finding even
the DMK too slow and respectable and
are turning toward extremist parties.
As democracy declines, all kinds of
traditional antagonisms are making
themselves felt in India again. The
question is not how or why these feel-
ings are now coming so dreadfully into
the open. The question is whether or
not they can be restrained until India
can revive her political stability in some
new form or until the Soviet Union
and the United States can come to
terms with each other in this troubled
subcontinent.


The professional persuaders
IF YOU THINK you chose the cigar-
ette in your hand, the chair you are
sitting in, or even the politician you
voted for last time entirely by yourself,
you are probably wrong.
Public relations is nothing new in
Australia, although many people, some-
times, it seems, including public rela-
tions officers, still have vague ideas
about what people working in the field
do and hope to achieve. However, what
seems remarkable is the spread of the
industry: nowadays few products go on
the market without some help from
public . relations.
Detergents and other washing prep-
arations seem to have saturation ad-
vertising, yet Colgate-Palmolive used
public relations as well to launch Bio-
Ad and Spree recently. The Prudential'
Assurance Company has used public
relations over many years to establish
the idea of the Man from the Pruden-
tial, although most people would think
that, assurance selling is very much an
individual affair. Most remarkable of
all seems to be the number of politicians
who nowadays feel that party endorse-
ment and willing amateur helpers are
not enough to get them into Parliament.
In a profession based on intangibles,
the success of the public relations cam-
paign will hinge on the hand in the
supermarket, on the impulse of the
moment. What has gone before this
moment of truth is hard to set down
accurately.
“It certainly can’t be judged on the
number of inches you get in newspapers
and magazines,” Norman Strachan, of
Freeden Strachan Public Relations, com-
mented. “Sometimes an inch in a
column is worth having, but masses of
literature descending on an editor’s
desk have only nuisance value. A new
product has to be presented, of course,
but the old style of public relations is
definitely going out. So are the big
lunches and launchings with cham-
pagne.”
Strachan, who describes himself as a
London Scot, did not begin a journalis-
tic career until he arrived in Greece
for a long holiday. His first published
article was completely unintelligible to
him. “Even my name was printed in
Greek.” He was delighted to hear that
two Greek businessmen were about to
start an English-language newspaper.
He appeared in the office clutching
stories under his arm to be met by
a desperate company a French
journalist and a Greek were turning out
a chaotic broken-English tabloid. “Never
mind freelancing,” they told him: “You
can be the editor.” After three years he
came to Australia.
“PR is a young business younger
by quite a few decades than advertis-
ing but it is gradually acquiring
respectability,” he said. “In fact, I
think, particularly in London, they
sometimes take it all a bit seriously •—•
there is room for humor in everything.”
Obviously with this in mind, Strachan
went forth armed with a flagon of
wine and a dozen eggs to throw at
editors as part of the launching pro-
gram for Colgate’s Bio-Ad, an enzyme
process for bleaching stains. Appar-
ently, the stained and bleached editors
took it all as good clean fun, for
Strachan has happy memories of the
newsworthy results.
‘‘There is a tremendous amount of
educational work to be done with
public relations. The educational aspects
are often neglected. Bio-Ad was a
major educational job. Its twin pro-
duct, Spree, is not quite so involved.
But until Bio-Ad came on the market
bleaches were all in the ferocious style,
and our claims sounded as though the
material would fall apart with the
spots.”
Introducing Australian women to
“biological soaking and pre-wash
powders” was not easy. Publishing
scientific backgrounds about breaking
down sugars in the fermentation of
wine, tanning leather with enzymes,
and the “enzyme explosion” left most
of them unimpressed.
“Technically,” said the advertisement,
“enzymes are organic catalysts which
assist a biological reaction to occur
much more rapidly.” Bleaches, on the
other hand, are “oxidising agents which
speed up the aging of cellulose and
other fibres.” A great deal of money
was spent in this line of reasoning
as the Colgate - Palmolive scientists
“adapted a specific enzyme known as
protease” for the Australian laundry.
Meanwhile, market research went on
steadily. “If you were an attractive,
intelligent girl of 23, spoke French,
Italian, and Arabic, studied jazz ballet,
loved going out to new restaurants and
cooking Greek dishes what sort of a
job would fit your personality?” asks a
Colgate publicity sheet. Obviously con-
ducting field tests for Bio-Ad. Thus
Claire Silberstein, psychologist, was
loosed upon the suburbs to find out
what sort of a reaction the enzymes
were getting.
“You really get to know how people’s
minds work and I find this quite
fascinating,” Miss Silberstein
announced.
Fortunately, the enzymes were also
working, so the public relations con-
sultants were helped by word of mouth.
Now there are other “enzyme explo-
sions” on the market. But as any public-

relations man will tell you gloomily,
“you can’t patent an idea.”
Bio-Ad was followed by Spree. (Many
of these names, though not, they say,
Colgate’s, are arrived at by feeding a
computer with various possible combina-
tions of letters. After all, it is just two
magic syllables they see.) Spree, which
certainly has a toujours gai quality
about it, is another product, and in its
turn involved the spending of hundreds
of thousands of dollars (according to
the accountants an impossible amount
to arrive at accurately) on the launch-
ing pad
The grocery trade, faced with, per-
haps, one new product a day, is gener-
ally strongly resistant. One corner
grocer said with Australian brevity: “I
don’t care who offers it it’s another
bloody new product.”
What Spree had to overcome was a
shortage of froth and bubble. Spree
■detergent was the “first regulated suds-
ing washing powder” made specifically
for the 40 percent of automatic wash-
ing machines now in Australian homes,
and with a “functional bluing agent”
to wash 52 percent brighter (there is
a machine called a reflectometer, which
is reputed to measure the degree of
brightness) and, furthermore, it is
guaranteed to be non-clog. But the
Mrs. Dorothy Deger finds fascinating
the job of telling women that too many
suds in their machine causes “suds clog”
unexpected lack of froth seemed to be
holding its sales back.
The public-relations consultants ad-
vertised for a woman with a friendly
personality and able to communicate
easily with people. As the job carried
a price ticket of $lOO a week, about
1200 women, quite prepared to be
friendly and to communicate, replied.
The response surprised the sponsors of
the idea.
Friendliest and most communicative
was Mrs. Dorothy Deger, of Palm
Beach. A 31-year-old woman who
expects her fifth child later in the
year, Mrs. Deger had a background of
journalism and publishing. Having
fought her way through the 1200 com-
batants for the job, the woman who so
fitted the image of the intelligent super-
housewife who wouldn’t be caught dead
using anything less scientific than the
non-sudsing detergent powder, then had
to make public appearances at big
shopping centres convincing her con-
temporaries that “the more suds the
cleaner the wash” is not true, and that,
in fact, excessive sudsing can slow down
the action and cause “suds clog,” a
selling situation which she, like Miss
Silberstein, “finds fascinating.”
Science has a definite place in public
relations. The lively young firm calling
itself Coombes/Brooks Programmers
are knee-deep in theses and courses in
political science. Partners in this group
where “storming around thinking up
ideas” is, they say, part of their day
are Kevin Brooks, a designer who has
worked in television and with books
and magazines, and Paul Coombes, a
graduate of Sydney University and
former journalist.
Working on the idea of providing a
package deal for the client, so that
both design and communications could
be handled at one and the same time,
and with a $2O capital and one client,
the Coombes/Brooks combination
began.
They also dressed in bright striped
suits with bell-bottom pants, painted
their Haymarket office a jazzy orange
(a reward for the five flights of stairs
to the top), styled their notepaper
with headless torsos of the team in
the right-hand corner, and fitted them-
selves with enthusiasm and talent into
what they believed was the image of
their day.
Since then they have acquired clients
who don’t fit, except in the matter of
money. “We have been looking at other
suits,” Coombes, now wearing sober
black with only a Regency stripe in the
shirt to show that a free spirit lurks
under the broadcloth, said sadly. “It
doesn’t do to arrive in some offices
looking too far out.”
From the beginning a lot of their
work has been for individuals. Pro-
gramming people toward success is a
public relations job where the results
can certainly be seen.
“We start by asking them to ask
questions about themselves,” Coombes
said. “So many people arrive without
any idea of what public relations can
do for them or what they want.”
Having sorted themselves out, the
clients are then planned and pro-
grammed toward success, though not
without some preliminary investigation.
Just as for any other product, a survey
appears necessary. This is particularly
true of the politicians who are beginning
to engage public relations consultants.
Paul Coombes has had several poli-
ticians as clients and, though he has not
yet steered a candidate to success, they
could hardly complain of the efforts
made on their behalf.
Dr. Barry Eggins, a Labor man and
an aspirant for the seat in Lismore in
the last N.S.W. elections, was one.
Aged forty, with three children, James
(14), Robert (10), and Suzanne (8),
he was a Country Party candidate for
Richmond in the mid-’fifties. Son of
B. J. Eggins, a well-known feed mer-
chant, he has been torn between agri-
culture and medicine most of his life.
Beginning at Hurlstone Agricultural
College, he went on to Sydney Univer-
sity, where he graduated in medicine.
But he went on to England for further
agricultural studies and returned to
work in the family business. In the
early ’sixties he was back at a university
in England studying tropical medicine
and later worked in a London hospital.
Here he was exposed to Wilson’s “prag-
matic, startling Labor Party” (Paul
Coombes’ description) and in 1962
became a member of the Australian
Labor Party. He is now a general
practitioner in the Lismore area.
Although Paul Coombes had only a
few weeks to mount a full-scale cam-
paign for Eggins, he worked hard to
establish the idea of a “future asset to
Parliament.”
“We didn’t have time to do a door-
to-door survey except in a very abbrevi-
ated way. So we took a straight look at
the policies involved and tried to get
basic and important issues before the
public.”
Working 18 hours a day, Coombes
and Brooks produced everything re-
quired for the campaign, posters and
pamphlets and material for the country
Press everything in fact but the
right result. But no one had expected a
miracle.
Eggins in the course of the cam-
paign sold himself solidly to his pro-
grammers, who are convinced he should
be the Premier in the fullness of time.
But in the meantime it is back to


the drawing board for the candidate
and his public relations men. Paul
Coombes gives a reduction to politi-
cians, probably because they fascinate
him, and are, he hopes, helping him
toward his M.A. honors in political
science.
Money is a variable commodity in
the public relations consultancy busi-
ness it seems to vary from $lO to
sl4 an hour, but the client can have a
brief promotional job done or a long-
drawn-out program arranged as his
budget permits.
Paul Coombes feels that this kind of
variation should be properly controlled
by the Public Relations Institute of
Australia. He is critical of the institute
and feels they do little more than hold
a monthly luncheon for members.
“We believe the institute should* be
looking to sell the concept of public
relations, the many sides of public
relations, and its uses to the community
as does its American counterpart and
the big public relations sections of the
major American corporations,” he said.
Coombes is also upset that the entry
form-dwells more on client information
than it does on educational and other
qualifications.
However, Mr. J. Thomson, honorary
secretary for N.S.W., feels that the
institute is doing its best to promote
public relations. About 220 members are
enrolled in the N.S.W. branch of the
twenty-year-old institution, almost that
number again in Victoria, and pro-
portionately fewer in the other States.
But a great many more people are
interested in joining.
“We would like to make belonging
to the institute and being accepted by
it a prerogative of working in public-
relations fields. In this way the fly-by-
nighters can be controlled. We have
a very comprehensive form to be filled
in, and as well an applicant must be
sponsored. Then he goes before the
admissions board.”
The institute is interested in the
five-year diploma course starting next
year at the Technical College, Sydney,
which will cover business management
and public relations.
“It would be excellent if this course
was a necessary part of working in
public relations, too,” Mr. Thomson
said. “Each year public relations work
becomes more professional.”
Ron Plater, of Ronald Plater & Co.
Pty. Limited, is convinced that the
public relations business has no
mystique. Surrounded as he is by big-
business clients, many with international
affiliations, he is often engaged not in
the promotion of a person or a product
but of a whole corporation. In 1964 he
was entrusted with the image of Britain,
when he handled the British Exhibition,
the largest trade promotion they had
ever put on overseas.
A graduate of Duntroon Military
College, and of both Sydney and Bris-
bane Universities, Ron Plater was the
1955/56 Australian Nieman Fellow in
Journalism at Harvard. He moved into
public relations after a journalistic
career both in Australia and overseas.
He was political roundsman and sub-
editor of the Sydney “Sun,” a columnist
for the “Courier Mail,” and with AAP
in New York.
All was going quietly, with emphasis
on public-relations work for financial
institutions, when Australian Oil and
Gas (only a small account) struck oil
in Queensland. When the Union Oil
Development Corporation suffered a

technical breakdown at Moonee, they
asked him for help in getting the right
information across to a worried public.
Other international tie-ups followed.
Now, ten years after taking the plunge
into public relations, Plater has no illu-
sions about it. “It is just doing a job,
usually one that someone in the com-
pany has already tried and feels it is
becoming too much for him,” he said.
“In the majority of cases industrialists
feel the need for something. They don’t
know what it is and turn to an expert
for guidance. Then it is a matter of hav-
ing a look at the operation, assessing
public attitudes, perhaps doing a sec-
tional survey, and finally developing a
written program for the first year to be
discussed with the client. Everything
must be completely flexible. There are
different problems in each situation.
Plans must be modified, changed, and
enlarged. Dealing with a big corpora-
tion is particularly complex. It isn’t
always easy to develop the image the
directors feel they need.”
The Prudential Assurance Company
Ltd., the biggest assurance organisation
in the Commonwealth, is one on which
the Plater “team-counselling method”
has been used.
In this case, what was required was
education to convince the householder
that the Prudential agents are not run-
of-the-mill, knock-on-the-door agents,
but carefully chosen professional men,
often with accountancy and legal back-
grounds, and that the Man from the
Prudential was a worthy recipient ol

i r j i
Sometimes we have found that to
f r i
get the right feeling about a company
it is necessary to find out if internal
public relations are running smoothly,”
Plater said. “Sometimes there is com-
plete lack of communication between
management and labor. But we have
no problems like this with the Pru-
dential.
“In the end it boiled down to finding
the perfect individuals who were good
examples of what the Man from Pru-
dential should be, and of publicising
them with a back-up reference to com-
pany policy as a whole.”
At this point good luck produced Lew
Marriott, Australia’s only flying life-
assurance salesman, who was operating
in north-west New South Wales in a
Cessna and writing millions of dollars’
worth of business while he was about it.
The perfect Man from the Prudential,

Dravo can sink the shafts and drive the tunnels to open up hidden resources
In 1898 Dravo Corporation re-
ceived its first general construc-
tion contract for a mine shaft. In
the subsequent 69 years Dravo
crews have completed more than
400 similar jobs, burrowing into
the earth great distances on jobs
such as: an aqueduct tunnel
driven through an underground
river, two uranium mine shafts
each nearly three-quarters of a
mile deep, and a quarter-mile-long
sloping entry into a coal mine.
Repeatedly, shafts have been
sunk and tunnels driven in sub-
stantially less time than allowed
by contracts. A new boring tech-
nique has been developed to
expedite the early completion of
mine ventilating shafts.
Underground work utilizes only
a few of Dravo's special skills:
engineering, project management
and construction. Your need may
be for other capabilities such as

BUSINESS AND THE ECONOMY
Guide lines for the economy
OF ALL THE GOOD things in the
“Australian Economic Review,” whose
first issue appeared last week, the most
useful will be the projections of the
future course of. economic activity. Up
to this time there has been no truly
objective attempt to provide this sort of
thing in Australia on a quarterly or any
other shortish-term basis at least backed
by such a wealth of expertly organised
background information as now mar-
shalled by the Institute of Applied Eco-
nomic Research under the editorship of
Dr. D. S. Ironmonger, in Melbourne.
The key word about it is its authen-
ticity, and businessmen and govern-
ments who follow its guidelines in their
business and economic planning can at
least be assured that whatever the Insti-
tute concludes about the 'future state of
the economy at least it will be arguing
from the basis of the most accurate in-
formation available, drilled in guardlike
fashion by the computer.
This isn’t to say that the economic
experts who now confidently put for-
ward their projections and observations
on the state of the economy are going to
be proved right all the time or even
most of the time, nor would they prob-
ably pretend that this will be so. The
art of the economic and business
huncher is not a monopoly of anybody,
and the place where it is less likely to
be successfully practised than most
other places is on the university campus.
By the same token, in pin-pointing the
economic way ahead it is always neces-
sary to predict the likely course eco-
nomic policy-makers themselves are
going to take, and how they will
interpret the same sets of statistics and
portents brought into the judgments of
the Melbourne University dons. It is
said that no two economists think alike
and that given a number of them to
solve the same problem, more often
than not you will get a large number
of different answers.
Bauxite
Ways and means
THERE’S REALLY no argument about
the fact that to get the most benefit
nationally from our minerals resources
the more we can do the processing of
ore concentrates in Australia the better
off we’ll be. The ideal, say in the case
of our bauxite deposits would be to pro-
cess as much of them as we can into
alumina in Australia and then to smelt
the alumina into metal here also
certainly enough to satisfy the whole of
our domestic demand, and on top of
that as much as we can conceivably
find exports markets for.
If this is the ideal, unfortunately the
exercise in the case of bauxite and its
derivatives is highly complicated and
requires a large degree of compromise.
That is to say, while Alcoa’s recent
move to double its smelting capacity
can be generally applauded (with the
reservation that, on the information so
far released, it seems to cut some
corners for the Japanese and Alcoa of
America) the new step, announced by
Comalco last week that it is joining in
a consortium of aluminium companies
in other countries to build an alumina
refinery in Sardinia, can also be seen
to have some merits.
As the company sees it, one of its
advantages is that it ties up a huge
market for Weipa bauxite in its raw
state. But even if there are practic-
ally unlimited deposits of the stuff at
Weipa, it would still earn a lot more
if exported as alumina. So what really
clinches the argument for it is the fact
that Sardinia is inside the Common
Market, which has a substantial import
duty on alumina. This means not only
that all the partners in consortium will
be supplying their European smelters
with alumina made from Australian
bauxite, but also that Comalco’s share
of alumina from the new refinery
will be marketable free of duty inside
the Common Market.
Trade mission
U.S. Government's first selling spree
AMERICA’S AILING overall balance
of payment problems, monetary prob-
lems, social problems and all were
affected not one jot by the most recent
and more or less unimportant symptom
—the first trade loss for five years in
March, announced by the Department
of Commerce. Explanations that the
figures were greatly exaggerated by the
11-day, New York dock strike that
month were barely audible in the
general gloom.
More significantly, the announcement
heralded by a couple of days the
arrival in Sydney last Monday of the
first trade mission to be organised and
operated by the U.S. Government; the
first, too, to cut across State and indus-
try lines, to include representatives from
all parts of the U.S. and a multiplicity
of industries.
Amongst the 41 members of the mis-
sion, only two are directly concerned
with the rural industries—the president
of the Dairy and Food Industries
Supply Association and the vice-presi-
dent of a company concerned with pro-
tein ingredients, for animal feeds.
Twenty-four are concerned with
machinery in all shapes and sizes for the
food, metal manufactures, and automo-
tive industries, among others; of these,
ten are specialists in the “high-tech-
nology” of automation. Five firms of
consulting engineers are represented;
three other members of the party are
here to arrange future trade missions
from Ohio, North Carolina, and the
automation industry. The others include
the vice-president of the Bank of
America, a director of the International
Executives Association, New York, a
handful of leading financial journalists,
and six members of the Department of
Commerce; a sober and resolute band
intent on export orders. It will be resi-
dent at Sydney’s Menzies Hotel until
May 3, at the Southern Cross in Mel-
bourne until May 9. For the business
and industrial worlds of Australia it
could provide, not least, food for
thought through which to better under-
stand the failings, weaknesses, and needs:
to which the mission has been attracted.
Car imports
Some odd engines
THE BIG BMC, front-wheel-drive
model 1500 mystery so tirelessly pur-
sued by the “Sunday Times” in
London over the past three or four
years has at last been unravelled, to
the satisfaction of the “Sunday Times”
at any rate. In the process, Australia
will receive shipments of engines for a
car which doesn’t exist.
The new, as yet unproductive, $32


million Cofton Hackett 1500 engine
plant in the U.K. is now supposed to
be functioning before the end of the
year at the rate of 1500 a week. But
the styling and engineering of the car
that it is designed to power has met
yet another setback since the merger
with Leyland last January. The 1500
and the fortunes of BMC as a whole
have now come under the control of
Leyland’s Sir Donald Stokes who will
run the entire show, called British
Leyland, with much the same powers
as a U.S. President. As far as the 1500
is concerned, Stokes has combined the
engineering and design talents of the
two companies for another re-think on
this ill-fated car, which has been
acclaimed as a last-ditch rescue opera-
tion. Its appearance date is now
scheduled for next year, which leaves
Stokes faced with the embarrassing
situation, later this year, of having to
stockpile the outpourings of Cofton
Hackett.
But the “Sunday Times” predicts
a face-saving operation: the engines will
be sent to Australia “to fit locally
assembled cars.” The only trouble
being that British Motor Corporation
(Australia) doesn’t know a thing about
it. The company claims that it is
“committed to and fully supports” the
Government’s “Plan A” for manufac-
turing cars in Australia with a 95 per-
cent Australian content. The program
stemming from the commitment has
been built around the Mini, the Morris
1100, and the Austin 1800. The only
major assembly part not so far made
in Australia is the engine, but the com-
pany has been arranging the setting-up
of its own engine plant over the past
two years. Clearly enough, it cannot
continue to import engines and meet
the progressive stages of “Plan A.”
Sir Donald Stokes has made it
equally clear that British Leyland badly
needs the 1500 to cope with the inroads
being made into the company’s markets
at home and abroad by competitors,
and it looks as if he is out to get it at
all costs. Stokes is also faced with
giant organisational problems, the lack
of a model policy and the eventual
necessity to rationalise dealer networks
and production facilities. Heads are
already falling and being knocked
together at a fearsome rate in the
initial melee. It is going to be a hard
race and a long one, but with British
Leyland running so fast from the start,
who knows just where and in what
guise those embarrassing engines will
turn up.
MEN AND MATTERS
ACADEMIC ECONOMISTS appear
to be stirring themselves and getting
more into the public issues play. The
more they do so the better. Ear too
often in recent years they’ve seemed to
be happier talking to themselves in
terms abstracted from the public arena
in a stratosphere of their own model-
ling. This is not to say that some of
them haven’t been doing yeoman ser-
vice behind the scenes like, say, Pro-
fessor Wilfred Prest of Melbourne on
the State Grants Commission and Pro-
fessor J. E. Isaac adjudicating on the
complex issues thrown up by the high-
flying demands of our air pilots. Again
in the sphere of agricultural policy, a
number of economists like, say, B. R.
Davison, Eric Donath, and K. O.
Campbell have made singularly valu-
able contributions to the clarification
of the issues involved and in a lot of
cases these people have dared to tread
on the feet of sacred cows and CSIRO
angels, sometimes to the latter’s acute
irritation and even embarrassment.
With the publication of a new
economic quarterly review by Pro-
fessor R. F. Henderson’s Institute of
Chancellor Menzies
Hugh McCarron
Applied Economics, Dr. W. M. Cor-
dent’s monograph “Australian
Economic Policy Discussion a Sur-
vey” and Professor R. I. Downings
latest illuminating excursion into W. C.
"Wentworth’s new social services ter-
ritory to blue-print a badly needed
fresh approach to employees’ pensions
we get a promising trilogy on useful
economic endeavor from Melbourne.
When Sir Robert Menzies, in his role
as chancellor of that university, was
opening a new postgraduate wing at
Ormand College the other Sunday, he
spoke of the necessity of this sort of
postgraduate work which nourishes a
lively nexus between town and gown; a
nexus which, in their reflective hours,
makes rich businessmen stir the firms
whose resources they direct to channel
an increasing flow of the wherewithal.
Without this the universities cannot
hope to make their extra-mural
activities much more than a passing
gesture to the communities business
and otherwise whose sustenance and
strengthening are the raison d’etre of
their existence.
When declaring open the new
McCaughey wing with its ultra-modern
flats for postgraduate workers at
Ormand, Sir Robert said he dreamed
that one day Melbourne University
would, as a postgraduate university,
house all its encumbents within its own
grounds, presumably putting an end to
the healthy flow of traffic between the
business houses of the city to and from
“the shop” on part-time commerce and
other courses. Such traffic has been of
enormous value, both to the University
and Melbourne, not to speak of the
tramways and the hostelries studding
the routes for generations. Both would
lose a lot if it was stopped. As it is,
far too many commerce and economic
graduates finally leave Gratten Street
with their heads stuck in academic
clouds, and some, sad to relate, never
quite come down to earth.
SIX YEARS AGO, Hugh McCarron,
then aged 40, left the Travelodge group,
where he was general manager, to “re-
tire” to his Wahroonga home, and the
company of his wife and two sons.
But last week, as managing director of
rival Australian Motel Industries
(which he set up after only 10 months
of retirement and at which he now
spends about 12 hours a day), he
opened AMl’s 30th Koala Motel, in
Sydney’s new 44-storey Park Regis
building.
In partnership with his travel
agent associate, Mai Middleton, he
opened what he describes as Australia’s
first modern-style motel at Orange in
1956. This went public, and was subse-
quently sold to Caravilla, one of the
large groups of motel operators that
mushroomed in the mid-’sos. He went
with the motel to become managing
director of the Carapark Company, and
when this was, in turn, swallowed in
1960 by Motels of Australia (now in
the news as the Travelodge group and
member of a consortium buying out
the American Travelodge chain of 400
motels), he became the group’s general
manager.
But after two years of working for
someone else, he decided to take a rest
in 1962; now he runs one of the major
competitors to his old company, is
vice-president of the Motel Federation
of Australia (and a former president),
and a board member of the Australian
National Travel Association.
The latest addition to Koala’s chain
of motels the 130-suite Koala Park
Regis motel (which is understood to
have been leased from the project
developers, Stocks and Holdings, at
very reasonable rates) is its first
move into city areas. But it will not be
the last. The company has already
announced it will run a motel to be
part of the $7 million Buckinghams
redevelopment in Oxford Street, which
will be an air terminal-cum-shopping
centre as well. And he expects many
more similar city motel projects, with
good parking facilities,- will follow in
the next five years.
Wheat
Puzzling prices
WHY DOES Australia sell wheat below
the International Grains Agreement
minimum price—and more than ten
percent below our cost of production


asks E. J. Donath, the perpetual critic
of Australia’s enthusiastic rush into
wheat production.
In a note on the “remarkably low”
sale price of the just published wheat
contract with the Republic of China
(Formosa or Taiwan), Mr. Donath
says: “Australia sold Taiwan 734,874
bushels for $1,047,700; this is nearly
two cents a bushel below the minimum
price of the new International Grains
Agreement, and nearly 22 cents less
than our officially assessed cost of
production of 164 cents a bushel.
Taxpayers will have to supply the ex-
port loss of nearly $162,000 as our
wheatgrowers are guaranteed the cost
of production price.
“Why does the Australian Wheat
Board sell so cheaply? This question
should be answered by the proponents
of our “Wheat Production Unlimited”
policy as they claim that there is an
unsatisfied demand for Australian
wheat, especially in Asian countries.
The low price might be even more
puzzling knowing that the IGA will
be operative from July 1, 1968; why
did the Wheat Board not wait a few
weeks in order to get at least the
minimum price?
“The simple answer is that there is
no shortage of wheat on the commercial
world market. Carryover stocks of
wheat in the U.S. are expected to rise
by 120 percent to 545 million bushels
at the end of June, as compared with
June 30, 1967. World wheat trade in
1967/68 is expected to be about five
percent smaller than in 1966/67 due to
a sharp reduction of imports in several
countries, especially Communist China
and the Soviet Union; small wonder
that world market prices for wheat
have been up to ten percent lower than
a year ago.
“In addition it is not sure whether
the International Grains Agreement
will be able to keep the price above
the minimum price as one large export-
ting country, the Soviet Union, might
not sign it, and the largest wheat im-
porting country, China, has not even
been invited to become a partner. Like
many other commodity agreements, the
new IGA could become a flop, which
may explain why the Wheat Board sold
at such a low price to Formosa, before
prices decline even further.
“The chairman of the Australian
Wheat Board, Dr. Callaghan, wrote in
a highly optimistic vein in an article
in the March, 1968, issue of the Journal
of the Australian Institute of Agri-
cultural Science that Asia’s population
explosion will generate tremendous
growth in future use of wheat in Asia.
On this reasoning, prospects for expan-
sion of Asian markets appear to be
considerable. Market researchers dis-
tinguish between commercial and
humanitarian demand for wheat. In any
case, it appears that the selling policy
of the Australian Wheat Board does not
concur with its chairman’s optimism.
If Australia has to sell wheat in a
drought year at give-away prices what
will happen when we produce 500
million bushels crops?”
The Croesus Touch
WHY DOMESTIC ECONOMIC
ACTIVITY
MANAGES TO KEEP COOL
BY J. C. HORSFALL
MORE AND MORE hot money has
been pouring into the country, chas-
ing minerals shares in their continued
upward flight but not, so the consumer
price index says quite firmly, making
the economy itself hot. We should be
thankful for this, for what seems to be
a sort of providential provision of
checks and balances has been operating
since the start of the financial year
ten months ago, when a lot of people
looking at the rather startling upward
thrust of consumer prices were in no
great hurry to hedge their bets that
we were heading for a boom.
Why, it may be asked, with all this
hot money about and with such liberal
applications of credit being adminis-
tered by the banking system (no let-
up in March either, going on the
figures issued last week) has the
economy kept at such a comfortable
temperature? For one thing the
passivity of fixed investment has had a
lot to do with it. There has, of course,
been some recovery in the level of fixed
investment but not of the order, one
suggests, to warrant calling it, as the
ANZ Bank does in its latest release of
business indicators, “perhaps the most
encouraging feature” of the present
economic scene. Overall in the last
December quarter it was only 12| per-
cent higher than in the exceedingly
depressed December quarter the pre-
vious year.
A sharp upturn in fixed investment
would certainly have made things a
good deal hotter in the economy than
they are now. But the conjuncture of
events was against it. For one thing,
the strong recovery in retail spend-
ing last year never swelled to a flood
which spilled into order books on the
scale sufficient to invite a wholesale
revision of investment expectations. For
instance, believe it or not, Australia-
wide retail sales (on a seasonally
adjusted basis) were a fraction lower
in February this year than they were
last July. True, these don’t include
motor vehicle new registrations, which
in February were 13 percent up on last
July, nor spare parts and petrol, but
they show that the manufacturing in-
dustry in general hasn’t had very much
incentive from higher sales to encourage
it to put out the investment boat.
Especially in a period when it was in
the process of absorbing the swinging
increases in award wages (three of
them) in 1966-67 and, in consequence,
suffering from squeezed profit margins.
, However, to get the real measure of
the checks to the upward movement
in domestic economic activity being
freely forecast last winter, you have
to turn to the position of the rural
industries, where events have proved a
dampener to retail spending and fixed
investment alike. Nor were these
events confined to adverse seasons even
if these were the main key to cautionary
attitudes in rural spending and invest-
ment. The reflection is clear enough
in the drop of about one-third in net
farm income in the current year as
estimated by the Bureau of Agricultural
Economics. It is also strongly reflected
in the rise of $123 million to $775
million in trading bank advances to
primary producers in 1967. In addition
to the cutback in farm output caused
by the droughts of the past three
years, primary producers have had
their profit margins cut by the scissors
movement of rising costs and reduced
prices. In the year to the end of
February, the export prices of every
primary product, except sugar (which
was steady), fell, some sharply (hides
and tallow by 23.3 percent, dried and
canned fruits 10, dairy produce 10.7,
cereals 7, and meats and wool both by
3.9 percent the wool cheque for
nine months was down about 7 per-
cent on the same period last year).
There are several reasons why all this
has not been reflected in export income
(which for nine months is an all-time
record of $2,248.5 million against
$2,205 million for the same period
last year. One is that export receipts
from cereals reflects the previous year’s
record harvest, another that metals ex-
ports have risen substantially. Even so,
because imports have been so much
higher in the nine months, the adverse
balance of visible trade has jumped
to $170.1 million more than four
times the adverse balance to that stage
last year and this would in itself
tend to have a dampening effect on
the economy.
So, with fixed investment failing to
respond to the extent thought possible
when retail spending was recovering so
strongly last year, with rural industry
generally exerting a dampening effect,
and a net depressant coming from the
bigger adverse trade balance (though
this is arguable in the light of the high
rate of capital inflow), inflationary
forces haven’t had it all their own way
in the last year when at one time it
looked distinctly possible that they
would get the upper hand. Anyway,
fears that we might by this time be in a
hot house were by no means ground-
less, with credit policy, Government
finance, and wages determinations con-
tributing strongly to the inflationary
thrust. As it worked out these influences
appear to have balanced the depressant
ones very nicely, and it is perhaps a
pity they were not at work, say, in 1966,
a particularly dull year for the economy.


Wool’s
problems
are basic
IT IS NOT just a marketing problem;
something is basically wrong with the
wool industry. And since wool is still
by far Australia’s biggest export
earner, it is important to find out
exactly what is wrong and to do
something about it. This is what one
group of wool men are now pressing
for. In an address to the Institute of
Directors this month, Mr. G. LeCouteur
complained that for ten years the ques-
tion of wool marketing had absorbed
the energies of the industry in unprofit-
able controversy and distracted atten-
tion from the real problem.
“If wool production is to increase,
our policies should be designed not to
influence prices through speculative
techniques, but by seeking to overcome
the basic causes for loss in profitability,”
he said. “The importance of wool to
Australia demands that these diversions
be now replaced by ordered and skilled
research into the wool-producing in-
dustry, designed to identify the real
problems and promote rational solutions
to them. The problems are as basic
as land title and immediately involve
questions such as economic areas and
the wisdom of subdivision of pastoral
properties.”
There is a growing concern of the
over-fragmenting of grazing properties
into uneconomic units. The recent
Bureau of Agricultural Economics
.study of economic aspects of the sheep
industry pointed to “adjustments” in
property size as a way of reducing
costs. Mr. LeCouteur pointed to other
problems as well, such as the equity
in statutory costs met by the wool-
grower, the increasing liability of
freight charges, and the incidence of
probate duties. “These are the regions
in which solutions to loss of profit-
ability in woolgrowing will be found,
and not in meddling with a market-
ing system which the trade endorses,
and certainly not in a new application
of the old disproven thesis that pro-
ducers must control supply to the
market to influence price,” he said.
“Nor does the solution lie in the
provision of price subsidies, which are
not only eroded by rising costs but
quickly result in a misallocation of
resources. We must seek, and find,
long-term solutions to the price-cost
problems which now beset our
greatest export industry.”
What Mr. LeCouteur thinks is
needed is for a properly constituted
select research committee appointed by
the Government to determine means for
re-establishing the incentive to produce
more and better wool. “Perhaps the
most positive action possible to en-
sure that apparel wool remains a com-
petitive fibre is to remove the disincen-
tives discouraging increased production.
“Evidence can be adduced to es-
tablish that demand will be maintained,
that the world’s users desire more good-
quality wool, that consumer inclina-
tions favor wool, and that the research,
product-proving, and promotion activi-
ties of the International Wool Sec-
retariat are effective and essential. Re-
cent evidence suggests that wool is now
receiving a price premium over com-
petitive man-made fibres, and that the
prognostications of an irreversible
downward price movement for syn-
thetic fibres were not justified. This is
based on announcements by three of
the biggest synthetic fibre-makers, in
January of this year, of price increases.
It is significant, also, that the policy of
promoting pure wool has encouraged
an increasing use of wool in blends,
this being particularly evident in Italy,
where per capita consumption of ap-
parel wool has increased over five years
from l£lb. to in excess of 21b. In
Japan per capita consumption was
1.61 b. in 1958 and is now over 31b.,
with some 80 percent of its wool
manufactures being sold to its local
markets.
“Australia’s clip consists of approxi-
mately 76 percent merino wool and
20 percent comeback and crossbred
types of 56s and finer quality. In com-
parison, 88 percent of New Zealand’s
wool production is of 50-5 6s and
coarser, with 70 percent coarser than
50s. Australia is the world’s largest
producer of apparel-type wool, and
this is the wool for which there is
not only a sustained demand but of
which the trade seeks an increasing
supply.
“In 1961, wool represented 10 per-
cent of total consumption of the main
apparel-type fibres. In 1966 this per-
centage had fallen to 8 percent, not
because of diminishing demand, as all
apparel-type wool fibre was absorbed
by the industry, but because of the
world’s need for increasing volumes of
apparel fibre to clothe its rapidly in-
creasing population. World production
of apparel-wool fibre has shown only
a small increase in the past five years,
and the growing demand for apparel
fibre has been filled by its competitors,
including those of the synthetics groups.
World population is today about
3500 million, and it is estimated it will
be rather more than 6000 million at
the close of the century. People will
still be clothed, and the danger is
that if wool production does not in-
crease progressively it could tend to
become too small a percentage of total
apparel-fibre consumption to attract
demand.”
Mr. LeCouteur also stressed wool’s
role in exports. “In the year 19.65-66,
wool contributed 31.2 percent of total
export income and 49.0 percent of the
value of rural exports. In 1966-67,
total export income was $3024 million,
and of this figure the primaries con-
tributed $1847 million. Wool repre-
sented 28.7 percent of total exports and
47.1 percent of rural exports.”
Mr. LeCouteur compared this with
the booming mineral industry. “In the
year 1966-67, mineral exports rose to
$384 million, and estimates suggest
that this figure will rise to $lOOO million
by 1972. However, it has also been
estimated that an expenditure of $2OOO
million will be required in the next
five years on exploration, production,
and treatment of minerals to enable
this rate of export growth to be
achieved. The contribution these
dramatic developments are making, and
will continue to make, to our economic
progress is indeed notable, but this
should not allow the importance of
wool income to be submerged.
“The mineral development relies
substantially on overseas capital invest-
ment which has to be serviced, and it
has been estimated that the net reten-
tion within Australia of overseas income
from mineral export is about 60 percent
of the gross export figures quoted. The
further investment needed to realise
export targets is very great indeed,
and in comparison the growth pros-
pects in wool production could be
realised on a substantially lesser capi-
tal investment almost wholly provided
from within Australia.
“Total investment in the rural sector
has recently been assessed at approxi-
mately $20,000 million, of which one-
third; or about $6700 million, relates
to sheep and wool production. Factory
investment has been assessed at $20,000
million also, this figure being based on
the established investment in fixed
assets of $BOOO million, representing 40
percent of the total assets employed in
factory production. In 1965-66, the
value of manufactured exports was 13.8
percent of total export income, and in
1966-67 15.1 percent. The significance
of wool as a contributor to general
economic growth is apparent from a
comparison of these export percentages.”

The economy: The Australian Resources Development
Bank was swamped with offers to lend over $2O million
when the first issue of transferable certificates of deposit
opened last week.
Treasury notes held by money market dealers rose from
$197.6 million in January to $240.3 million in February,
compared with $89.6 million in February, 1967. Reserve
Bank’s holdings of gold and foreign exchange eased a
marginal $2.2 million to $1017.7 million in the week to
April 17.
The markets: The London market had another very
good week, with many industrials reaching records, and the
industrial average rising to a new peak of 470.7. Vietnam
peace hopes and good company news encouraged buyers,
although the rise in the U.S. re-discount rate and McChesney
Martin’s “financial crisis” speech brought a sharp setback
earlier in the week.
The first deficit in five years of U.S. world trade provided
a reason for investors to take profits on Wall Street.
Traders seemed cautious pending concrete developments
toward preliminary peace talks between the U.S. and
North Vietnam.
Triggered by the U.S. trade deficit, w'hich cast doubts
on the dollar’s staying power, the price of gold in London
reached the highest level since the “free” market opened
at the beginning of April.
Records were made to be broken last week on Australian
share markets, with mineral stocks holding the stage.
Climbing to new all-time-heights, BHP hit $23.70, CRA
$15.30, Hamersley $12.50, and Mt. Isa $7.60. London
Interest, soon to be followed by European interest, was a
major factor in the upswing, especially as local markets
were closed for Anzac Day, Thursday.
Companies: The sedate directors of the National Bank
predict another record profit for 1967-68, judging by the
first half year . . . and the Bank of Adelaide also announced
higher profit for the March half. Two financiers announced
par issues to shareholders, a one-for-ten by Alliance
Holdings and a one-for-eight by Beneficial Finance, which
has just raised dividend from 8 to 8J percent with a final
A\ percent payment, as profit rose 14 percent for the year
to March. The debenture issue of ICIANZ was 33
percent oversubscribed.
The Rothschild creation, International Pacific Corporation,
plans to form an Australian-based public investment
company whose shares will be available to European
investors through Amsterdam Stock Exchange listing, and
later London.
As it has become the vogue for individuals to make bids
for public companies, Sydney freelance journalist Mr. F.
Browne offers about $662,000 for 51 percent of Shipping
Newspapers’ capital. The 75c price for the 50c shares
is described by directors as “ludicrous.” Despite
Juanita, McDowells has received acceptances for 60 percent
of Mark Foy’s capital . . . and the family company of
Mr. L. Senes made a cash bid of $1.75 a share for an
initial 51 percent of Rigneys Holdings. The pace got too
hot for Messrs. Austen and Butta, who retired from the
battle for Lithgow Valley, which will probably fall to
Slater, Walker.
In the reverse of the usual pattern, Travelodge Australia
is taking a large financial interest in its San Diego affiliate,
Travelodge Corporation, which is the second-biggest
motel chain in America, and the Australian company will
provide top management, receiving a management fee
as well.
Moving into automotive equipment, Email will manufac-
ture carburettors and fuel systems under licence for
Chrysler. In its first approach to the Australian public
since formation in 1965, Chrysler Credit Australia will seek
up to $2.5 million debenture money. York Motors are
enjoying buoyant demand for their entire range of vehicles,
in the first four months of the current year. Conquip
forecasts a higher profit for the current year to June, in
announcing a one-for-five par issue.
Kinnear’s Ropes earned $546,000 profit in the year to
February. British Petroleum staged a strong recovery in
1967, with a profit of $4.4 million, boosted by higher sales
and lower coastal freight charges. Second Australian oil
search company to pay a dividend, Ampol Exploration
declared a 5 percent payment tax-free, absorbing $820,000
of the $1,111,000 profit earned in the March half year.
Comalco, the CRA-Kaiser Aluminium offspring, will take
a shareholding in a new company formed to build an alumina
plant in Sardinia, within the Common Market, and will
be sole supplier of the 1.2 million tons of bauxite to be
used annually. Alusuisse, which owns Nabalco jointly with
CSR, is entirely satisfied with the quality and size of the
Gove bauxite deposit, but the alumina plant at Gove
will now cost about $3OO million, considerably more than
earlier estimates.
BH South predicts a lower group profit of $2.5 million
for the current year to June, compared with $2.6 million
last year, and $3.2 million the year before . . . and New
Broken Hill is also expecting a somewhat lower profit in
1968, because of possible overproduction of lead and zinc.
RTZ chairman atacked Australia’s uranium export
embargo . . . Exoil’s Mt. Painter uranium deposit may be
commercial, according to the chairman’s interim report . . .
In its first capital raising since 1954 flotation, Uranium
Consolidated will make a one-for-one issue.

Something
for
nothing!
•V.
A
by Peter Boxall
Eastern’s Regional Manager
Strolling through a city store this
week, I was given a free sample pack
of cigarettes. “It’s not often you get
something for nothing these days,” I
mused.
Which brings me to a new idea of
Eastern’s, literally something for noth-
ing; a free sampling of the U.S.A. for
you en route to Europe via Mexico.
Let me elaborate. On Qantas' Fiesta
Service you can pick up an Eastern jet
in Mexico City or Acapulco, cross the
U.S. and rejoin a Europe-bound flight
at New York, or any other Eastern gate-
way, for no extra cost in air fare.
A typical route takes in New Orleans,
Atlanta, Baltimore and New York, with
stopovers to suit, and the VIP service
no money can buy—because Eastern
provides it with a smile for free.
Your travel agent will gladly help you
decide on a route from numerous
stopover possibilities, all packed with
individual interest.
This is Eastern's way of introducing
more and more people to more and
more of the States . . . and it’s an ideal
opportunity for you to see the U.S.A.,
at no extra air fare, on your way to
Europe. It’s not often you get some-
thing for nothing these days, so call in
and talk to your travel agent about
Eastern.
See how much better
an airline can be.

The cheapest
shares can show
highest return
IT’S ON AGAIN. The mining boom,
that is. Prices are up, turnovers and
blood pressures are up. As before,
London is leading the way, with its
overnight prices,
As the oil market hasn’t moved as
far and as fast as the minerals market
over the past weeks, and as it looks as
though it will be only a matter of time
before it does (provided the current
mood continues), I decided that this
was the best place to be. After a close
study of the lists it came down to two
stocks—Oil Search and Amalgamated
Petroleum. Both looked good. In the
end I decided on Amalgamated
Petroleum, mainly because its shares
were cheaper. This is working on the
theory that the cheaper the shares the
greater the chance of a higher percent-
age return. The company’s shares have
in fact had a good gain already. The 16
cent-paid shares have risen by over
30 percent in the past seven days and
are still going strong. And if the
current upward pressure on the prices
continues, it seems more than a good
50-50 bet that the price will go even
higher. As you may recall, Amalga-
mated and myself are old friends. I’ve
bought into and sold out of the stock
twice over the past nine months or so.
The last time, which was only back in
March, I was in and out of the stock
in just over a week. This quick deal-
ing is quite often necessary in the fast
and furious oil market and it is con-
ceivably what could also happen again
this time. Still, if I can make as much
profit as I did on the last two occa-
sions, I certainly won’t complain. In
case you’ve forgotten Amalgamated is
the company, which, amongst other
things, is currently investigating 500
square miles of mining leases at
Leonora, Western Australia (about
which there are the usual number of
rumors of nickel prospects), the com-
pany which owns half a million shares
in Timor Oil, and the company which
has oil wells in Queensland (near
Roma) that are actually selling (for
cash) some quantities of oil. In fact as
far as oil companies go this one has a
lot more going for it than most. I
bought 2000 of the 16-cent-paid shares
(the cheapest) for 25 cents.
My second buy this week was also a
miner, but a much less speculative one.
This company is more confusing than
anything else. It’s Mount Lyell Mining
and Railway Co. Ltd. The reason the
company is confusing is because of the
unclear future of the price of copper.
The U.S. copper strike has caused
general disorder (more than usual, that
is) in copper circles. It has created
abnormally and artifically high prices
which has left many would-be investors
in copper companies somewhat uncer-
tain as to how much they should pay
for their investment—l must admit
that I can see their point of view.
Nevertheles's, in the case of Mt. Lyell,
I do feel that today’s price of $1.78
seems a much more than fair one (for
the investor, that is). Last year the
company produced 14,500 tons of
copper, received an average price of
$lO2l for it, and made $2.75 million.
This year, despite a bad start when
temporarily reduced copper prices
and increased overheads made a
slight dent in its interim profits,
it now looks like bettering all these
figures. Over Christmas the company
increased the capacity of its crushing
plant from 2.2 million tons a year to
2.5 million tons, and it also moved into
a higher average grade ore area —both
factors that will increase this year’s
output. Total copper output for
1967-68 is now generally expected to be
somewhere around 16,000 tons. Price
wise the company will also do much
better than it did last year. Despite
the fact that the average price received
for the first half of the year was down,
the increased prices being received in
the current half of the year will more
than compensate. Overall the average
annual price is expected to be some-
where around $2OO a ton higher than
it was in 1966-67. The current Aus-
tralian Copper Producers’ price, at
which Mt. Lyell sells most of its copper,
is now in excess of $l3OO and the
present world shortage of the metal
seems almost certain to keep it at these
levels for at least another 12 months.
Thus, with a 10 percent increase anti-
cipated in production (for only a rela-
tively small increase in cost) and a 20
percent increase in prices received, the
company looks set for a record year. Its
current price of 9 cents below its 1967
high figure is an extremely modest one.
I bought 300.

MARKET POINTERS • SECURITY ANALYSIS • COMMODITIES
By JASON
SO WHAT do you do now? Without
foreign buying, our stockmarket would
collapse; with it, the market would go
a lot higher yet. The odds are that
foreign portfolio investment the best
kind we can get, since it leaves control
of our companies well and truly in Aus-
tralian hands—will continue for a long
time. Despite the worried words from
the U.S. about the gold crisis (aimed,
it seems, mostly at forcing a cretinous
Congress to pass the much-needed higher
tax legislation), the international mone-
tary situation seems to be improving.
There is no escaping the fact that
another world monetary crisis—or the
taking to too savage measures to avoid
one—would have a serious impact on
the level of Australia’s economic growth
and on the flow of cash here. However,
there is some prospect that the strength
of the Australian dollar is so great that
even if things got tough in the world
money scene, Australia might be a better
haven for foreign funds than many other
countries.
But right now things are going our
way. The money is flowing in at a great
rate; Europeans are learning about
investment opportunities in Australia for
the first time in investment symposiums;
a new Australian investment trust backed
by the Rothschild-Oppenheimer group
-(through International Pacific Corpora-
tion) has been formed, for listing in
Amsterdam, to attract European funds;
Australian brokers are going abroad in
their hundreds drumming up business;
and the facts are that there are still
fortunes to be made here—just like the
fortunes that so many British investors
have made in the past year or so in
BHP, WMC, and the CRA group,
For there is no doubt that the boom-
inspired expenditure of massive sums on
prospecting in Australia right now will
result in major new discoveries; there
has never been such an exploratory
effort in this country before. When
analysts sit down and tell you that
BHP is only worth a fraction of its
current market on even the most opti-
mistic valuation of what it has, they
are omitting one very important factor
—what the company WILL have.
There is no easy way of valuing these
booming mineral and oil shares; of
course, there is a speculative content
in their price which could well
evaporate. But that is what a booming
market is all about. (What did the
market know of BHP’s prospects two
years ago?) And given a continuation
of mineral discoveries and development
and a continuation of the demand for a
stake in it from overseas, then this
market will continue to boom. Forget
about local market considerations; they
don’t matter any more. Take more
notice of such foreign factors as London
account periods as a price guide than
Australian market influences, like the
time of the year or the local level of
liquidity.
Nevertheless, at this stage, there is no
telling when it will be time to get off
this ride—if ever. There will be fluc-
tuations in this market for external
reasons and sooner or later the intensity
of demand may subside. But, on the
other hand, there could soon be a
shortage of sellers if the rate of large-
scale acquisition continues; it seems
that most of the recent sellers of BHP,
for instance, have been profit-takers
who bought for resale rather than
long-term holders who have changed
their mind and got out of the stock.
Are most of BHP’s current holders
likely to hold for ever? The more that
buy to put away, the fewer shares that
will be available.
As the Cowan service, which has
been very cautious indeed about this
boom, says this week: “Whilst this bull-
market which is now in full swing
remains extant, you simply MUST par-
ticipate. in it and continue to participate
in it for so long as it lasts (which may
be but a brief time or a very long
time).” And Graeme Moir’s advice to
his clients this, week is: “We counsel
them to stick with their holdings (of
key natural resources stocks likeßHP,
CRA, Hamersley, and WMC) for con-
tinued major long-term capital
growth.”
THIS COULD be a momentous week
for Western Mining Corporation. On
Friday one of the most influential and
informed commentators on WMC will
be releasing a circular to clients on the
stock, and what he says will probably
have a significant impact on its price.
Fie is Melbourne stockbroker F. R.
Morgan, the man who started the
The Chartist says:
.BHP was first recommended in this column in June, 1966, for both long- and short-
term investors when prices were round the $6.00 level. It was suggested at that
time that BHP could be about to commence a new “growth” phase in a trend
which could continue for some years. It is now interesting to see what has
happened to BHP in terms of market appreciation during the past two years.
Targets of up to around $24.00 have been already mentioned during the trend
development and it now seems likely that prices will rise to at least $29.00 in the
short to medium term at possibly a rate of appreciation comparable with that up
to the November peak in 1967. There is also the possibility of a “measured
move” condition which could eventually take prices to about the $40.00 level. This
will be confirmed as the future trend develops. Last sale price on 24/4/68 —$22.80.


WMC boom in earnest just 13 months
ago with a monumental study that sug-
gested the stock was worth about $16.70
(before the share split) if it proved 10
million tons of ore and put it in a
smelter. Well, the company has done
a lot better than that. But how much
better? The Morgan circular will pre-
sumably say whether or not he thinks
the stock is worth three times his orig-
inal estimate, which is what its current
price represents, in view of subsequent
developments. It is difficult to see him
thinking so if he uses the same criteria
he used last time, and if he does suggest
the stock is overpriced it could have
a depressing impact on the market. On
the other hand, there could be other
influences at work on this stock. In
Chartist terms, WMC still has some
rise left in it.
THE GOVE alumina project is not
going as well as the Australian parti-
cipants, led by Colonial Sugar Refining,
would like. Last week’s news that the
alumina complex planned by Alusuisse
(the 50 percent partner in Nabalco, the
operating company) would cost $3OO
million instead of the originally sug-
gested $2OO million is serious enough
to have prompted the locals to take
further advice. It is understood that
they have arranged for an American
consultant, the Parsons Jurden Corpora-
tion, to review the capital cost estimates
before they decide on what action they
should take.
So far there are no estimates of likely
income on the new cost basis publicly
available, but it seems possible that it
could be low enough to allow any
uneasy local participants to withdraw
if they like; they can get out if the
profit rate falls below 74 percent on
equity capital. But so far there are
believed to have been no defections,
nor are any believed likely, at least
until the report from Parsons Jurden
comes in.
There have been comparisons between
the capital cost involved in this project
of $3OO million for a minimum output
required by the Commonwealth of
500,000 tons of alumina a year by 1971,
with the 600,000 tons a year from
Gladstone backed by capital costs of
only $l5O million. But apart from the
facts that Gladstone’s alumina cost
must include some proportion of the
capital cost of Weipa (much of whose
bauxite is exported raw to other
alumina refineries), the fact remains
that Comalco has been able to reduce
its capital costs by building its refinery
at Gladstone where there was an exist-
ing infrastructure, instead of up in the
bush as Weipa. The offsetting disad-
vantage is that it has to meet higher
transport costs. Clearly, the major
benefits of Gove, where everything is to
be done on the site, will not be felt
until atomic power enables smelting to
take place there, too. But in the mean-
time, the costs of setting up a small city
in the wilderness are going to be over-
whelming. Perhaps the present study
may suggest that the Comalco approach
be followed, with only the mine at
Gove and the refinery in a southern
population centre.
Anyway, this is important to share-
holders in CSR, which has percent
of the action. Others involved are Peko
with 6J percent, the Bank of N.S.W.,
the CBC, and Elder Smith with 2\ per-
cent each, the AMP with 5 percent,
and the MLC with 3f percent.
WHAT IS the best way to share in the
Australian mining boom? Probably one
of the cheapest is the London-registered
Rio Tinto-Zinc Corporation, parent
company of bounding CRA and Ham-
ersley. As this week’s Moir’s Australian
Investments points out, RTZ is partic-
ularly attractive to Australian investors
who have missed the bus on CRA. One
major reason for CRA’s much higher
price in relation to its capitalisation
than its parent RTZ is simply that
there is a scrip shortage—only 15 per-
cent of its capital is listed here.
Moir takes the view that RTZ is
good buying, not only because Ham-
ersley should provide a very substantial
gain in earnings for 1968 but that its
Palabora copper project will have been
doing well during the period of high
copper prices and that from 1970 a
dynamic upsurge of earnings could be
expected from its uranium interests,
particularly the Rio Algom mine.
HAMERS LEY IRON are reported to
be having trouble with their newly
commissioned pellet plant built by
Dravo at Dampier. Capacity is believed
to be cut back to one-third normal
level after having been suspended
completely between April 1 and April
10. When it was returned to operational
use at full bore, a ventilator overheated,
causing the operation to be cut back.
Meanwhile, the company is negoti-
ating in Japan with Kobe Steel, who,
in January, gave the Western Australian
iron-ore exporters a letter of intent to
buy 10 million tons of low-grade over-
burden over 12 years starting 1970. The
iron content of the offer is 56-58 per-
cent, and the offered price an extremely
low 8.5 U.S. cents per unit.
CHALLENGERS to the S w a n
Brewery’s Western Australian monopoly
League Brewery Co. Ltd. have
issued a prospectus for a par issue of
999,995 ordinary $1 shares, payable ten
cents on application, the rest on call.
The plan is to produce beer for con-
sumption initially in Western Australia,
but later throughout the Common-
wealth and overseas. They list as
potential outlets 280 free-trading hotels,
213 gallon licensees, and 246 clubs; a
significant proportion are claimed to
have agreed to market the new beer.
The company was set up after an
advertisement was placed seeking to
gauge the interest in setting up a rival
to the Swan Brewery. This, on the
company’s account, brought in a good
response, and the decision was made to
go ahead and set up a public company.
The three directors are all estate agents,
but expertise is being bought for the
new venture.
The Melbourne market
Getting into
top gear
UNTIL ITS LAPSE a couple of years
ago Preston Motors had quite a dis-
tinguished record not only as dividend
payer but also for covering its payments
well with earnings, its showing in 1962,
when most other motor distributors
were making heavy weather of it, being
particularly good. Measured against
that background the present price of
59 cents for the shares looks rather
silly. What are the prospects for the
shares now that motor sales have given
proof of sustained recovery?
Maybe, as the company’s chairman,
A. I. Tomlins, said at the annual
meeting last week, motor registrations
in Australia are going to hit a new
record this year. They’ve certainly
been doing much better so far, though
on a seasonally adjusted basis March
registrations were a thousand or so
less than February’s and a few below
January’s also, even if 3230 above those
of March a year earlier. Surprisingly
enough the trend of registrations these
last two months in Victoria has been
better than the national performance
as a whole. This only goes to show
that the drought that’s been hitting the
western district and the Wimmera
harder than most country areas hasn’t
been the drag on the State’s overall
motor vehicle sales that might have
been thought. At any rate, sales in the
city where Preston mostly sells appear
to justify the chairman’s optimism.
Even so, nobody is anxious to rush in
and buy the shares of this or any other
motor distributor on the Melbourne
exchange. The only one to attract any
sustained attention for some time has
been Australian Motor Industries, which
got up to $llO a few months ago, but
the shares have been hanging fire since
all the fuss over the reputed wiles of
importers of Japanese cars on which
AMI is putting so much store. AMI
has come back to 93 cents for the 50-
cent shares, at which the yield is 5.6
percent, a shade under that of Preston
Motors, the State’s leading Holden
dealer, at the current price of 59 cents
for the 50-cent shares. The latter
would seem to discount a further

market penetration previously enjoyed
now that demand for the wide range of
special features can be more accur-
ately ■ determined and provided for.”
Although he also spoke of the drought,
it was only to say that it has affected
sales of parts. A hopeful sign for profits
is seen in the efforts being made to con-
solidate the Melbourne metropolitan
set-up, which in the past has suffered
somewhat from too great a dispersion
of activities and, apparently, slackness
in accounting arrangements. Obviously
the profusion of Preston Motors’ second-
hand car outlets has been a drain on the
group, and as more of these are closed
or consolidated, the profit prospect will
benefit. But how long is the sales im-
provement likely to last? However,
although the group is tightening things
up, the pace at which this is being done
is, going on the chairman’s statement,
all too slow perhaps it will not be
truly effected until the present buying
wave has run its course.
A clue to the dividend prospects was
given with the resumption of final pay-
ments last year at 7 percent, but the
true earnings cover for this cannot be
accurately determined, because the tax
provision was substantially reduced as a
result, taking account of previous
losses. At best the cover was 1.8 times
and at worst something, say, of the
order of 1.5. Be that as it may, the pros-
pect of further true net profit improve-
ment offers a good chance of the divi-
dend ultimately being restored further
toward the old 15 percent level; and
the more it did, so would the current
price of 59 cents for the shares look
the more historically cheap. But are
they as cheap or cheaper, say, than
Lanes, the big Melbourne distributor of
BMC, Chrysler, and Mercedes-Benz
vehicles, which recently filed a story of
continued recovery (unfortunately with-
out giving any profit figures) for the
half-year to December 31 last, when
sales increased by just on $2 million to
$17.1 million?
Lanes Motors (Holdings) has in its
favor that since the recession struck in
1961 it has a much more consistent
record than Preston Motors, not having
been out of the dividend list far from
it. The dividend has held at a steady 20
percent rate these past four years (its
usual interim of 1\ declared recently
confirming this rate for the current
year). Last year this 20 percent rate was
almost twice covered by earnings, so the
possibility that some increase on last
year’s percent final is by no means
remote going on the latest reported sales
increase. Why, then, the yield of 8 per-
cent at the current price of $1.25 for the
50-cent shares when Preston yields only
5.9 percent and has a net assets back-
ing of only half as much per share? If
the market’s answer is clear enough
that it is expecting a bigger lift in the
Preston payout a counter argument
would be that a bird in the hand is
worth two in the bush.

How we got a really good overseas agent.
Mr. C. Macnaught, talks on overseas agents
For years, C.C.Macnaught Pty. Ltd.
of Sydney, has been the market leader
in pumps and lubricators. They started
exporting in the ’sos - and put the
pressure on, appointed an energetic
export manager. Now they sell to
48 countries.
Exporting accounts for nearly 40 percent
of their turnover, and it’s expanding at a
faster rate than the home market.
Here’s how they appointed their German
agent:
“We put an advertisement in the German
papers asking for a good distributor.
We had a coupon in the ad., and the
replies went to the Australian Trade
Commissioner in Bonn. We got over
200 enquiries. The Commissioner picked
about a dozen finalists. We flew over,
interviewed them, and selected the man
we thought was best. We briefed him
carefully, sent stock over. Of course we
regularly go over there to keep him up to
date. He’s doing really well. We now have
a standing order for 300 units a month.
Very nice.”
Sounds easy? Well, exporting may be
easier than you think!
Note: Exporting can increase your
turnover, can lower unit cost of your
product, can iron out seasonal fluctuations;
and can increase profits. Your company
will gain extra marketing knowledge,
and prestige.

Behind the balance sheets
Why the British like Jennings
SWIM WITH the tide is the best in-
vestment advice for today. And the
tide of British portfolio investment is
coming in at a great pace for A. V.
Jennings Ltd., the Melbourne-based
Australia-wide building and construction
company that is reported to be on the
“favored” list of several British brokers.
It is favored for good reasons. Apart
from its own good performance record,
it is getting some important side-benefits
from the developmental projects in re-
mote areas that are transforming the
Australian minerals industry and
equally importantly, its status with
British investors is high because of the
increasing important associations it has
been building up with major British
companies.
Its links with Costain, with Arn-
dale, with Town and City Properties,
and with the Pru, are all pretty useful
in status terms. Costain Developments
(Aust.) Pty. Ltd., whose British parent,
Richard Costain, is a large international
land and home development company,
linked with Jennings in August, 1966,
in the largest private housing develop-
ment project undertaken to that date
in Australia. Costain owns the land,
and is spending sll million on develop-
ing services at Gladstone Park, Broad-
meadows, and Jennings is doing the
housing development and promotion.
The recent takeover in Britain of the
Arndale Property Trust by Town and
City Properties, which became
associated with Jennings in 1967, will
mean the expenditure of millions in
Australia, in whose development Jen-
nings must share, and its close links
with the Prudential Assurance won’t do
Jennings any harm, either. Jennings
first associated with Town and City on
a multi-storey office development in
Australia, where Jennings carried out
the professional services, construction
co-ordination, management, and finance
procurement.
There could be more links to come,
although there has been no elaboration
yet on the chairman’s announcement
last November that the company would
form a new group, following dealings
with overseas interests, to cope more
adequately with demand for services in
new development projects.
Jennings’ other international connec-
tion, minority shareholdings in a Malay-
sian and a New Zealand company which
manufacture Trimview metal doors and
windows under licence, completes Jen-
nings’ emergence as a large national
corporation, with expanding inter-
national connections, where six years
ago it was a medium-sized Victorian
company.
Launched in the unlikely days of the
Depression, the group went public in
1950. Suspension of large-scale govern-
ment housing works plunged the com-
pany into the red in 1953 and 1954.
Looking back on that experience, Mr.
A. V. Jennings, the founder, admits it
was the best thing that ever happened,
because it taught the company to
diversify within the industry.
The usual break-down of group sales
is 50-60 percent in construction, 30 per-
cent in housing, and 16 or 17 percent
in manufacturing. But in the last full
year large-scale housing contracts
carried out for Hamersley Iron (which
may give some extra glamor in British
eyes) at Dampier and Mt. Tom Price
(worth $4.9 million in total, although
the project probably carried through to
the current year) gave a breakdown for
1967 of 39 percent for housing, 40 per-
cent for construction, and 15 percent
for manufacturing.
The completion of some of these
profitable big contracts could have
played some part in the remarkable 54
percent improvement in profit in the
latest half year for turnover improved
by only 6 percent. But it could
also speak volumes for the company’s
efficiency.
In any event, the full year’s turn-
over will certainly be up by more than
six percent. The construction group
looked forward to further expansion of
its activities in 1967-68 due to the high
level of uncompleted work at June 30 of
$29 million (which had risen a further
$4.5 million by last December) and to
success on several major projects since
balance date.
Contracts signed and sales orders in
the half-year to December 31 rose 23
percent to $38.5 million, and uncom-
pleted work for contracting and housing
operations rose 16 percent to $33.5 mil-
lion. Contracts signed for dwellings rose
14 percent to 1090 units. All the indi-
cators said “go.”
If the company should earn only as
much in the second half of the current
year as it did in the first half, its earn-
ing rate on enlarged capital would be
45 percent, a few points better than the
last year’s outcome on average capital
increased by the recent one-for-four
premium issue. But it should do con-
siderably better than this, and in any
event, in 1966-67 the June half provided
about 62 percent of the result, so 45
percent could be an unreasonably con-
servative forecast of likely earnings for
1967-68.
And there seems little doubt that, in
the present climate in the building' in-
dustry, Jennings’ turnover will continue
its rise of the past four years. Since 1963
sales have multiplied 2.4 times, after-
tax profits 2.6 times. The latest half
year’s results suggest that the excellent
1967 profit was no flash in the pan. In
fact, it simply restored the old ratio
between turnover and profits that had
previously existed; net profit to turnover
fell from 2.2 percent in 1963 to 1.85
percent in 1965, but recovered to 2.29
percent in 1967 and to 2.39 percent
in the latest six months. The turnover
improvement in the year to June was
20 percent (compared with a 9.3 per-
cent increase in the statistician’s figures
of the value of building commence-
ments in Australia, which bear distinct
correlation to Jennings’ sales changes).
So the 16.7 percent rise in the value
of buildings commenced in Australia
in the eight months to February (up
13 percent for houses and flats, up
18 percent for non-dwellings) com-
pared with the similar period of
1966-67, is a sign of optimism for
Jennings.
The A. V. Jennings group is ap-
proximately the same size as the
Sydney-based Lend Lease Corporation
(whose 1967 turnover was $62 million
and profit $1,524,000), but Lend Lease
employs more than three times Jen-
nings’ funds because it holds many of
its development projects when con-
struction is complete, for long-term
investment, so giving a solid backing
to Jennings. As far as shareholders are
concerned, though, Jennings has
proved the more attractive and re-
warding in the last five years.
Lend Lease has had some problems
with its residential operations, but has
been very successful on retail com-
plexes and construction of multi-
storey office blocks, which Jennings has
largely left alone. But as Jennings has
now achieved almost full national
coverage with its other construction
and housing operations (it entered
housing in S.A. and W.A. in 1962-63 r
and N.S.W. and Queensland in 1963-
64) the obvious moves for greater
market penetration, apart from its
present omissions from housing in
Queensland and general .construction
in Tasmania, are to high-rise build-
ings (primarily offices, hotels, and
inner-city housing development) and
into new products associated with
building and construction.
Although Jennings is possibly the
largest single home builder in the
nation, its housing commencements in
1966 and 1967 only represented about
2.5 percent of the nation’s total. (Its
designs are aimed at the middle- and
lower-income brackets, as this is the
biggest market.) The building indus-
try is still highly fragmented, because
it does not lend itself to mass pro-
duction, but the trend to flats (versus
houses) must increase Jennings’ -
capacity to cater for housing needs,
and ever-increasing wage costs must
be countered by greater planning and
standardisation which the project
builders and developers provide.
The company carried out extensive
capital projects to lay a foundation
for future profits, and a program of
capital raisings and profit conservation
was used to finance this expansion.

By 1966 the results showed beneficial
effects on profitability, and cash flow
improved accordingly.
When the October, 1966, one-for-
four bonus share issue was made,
directors announced that at the higher
level of turnover, operations con-
tinued to be profitable, contracts were
being completed on schedule, quality
was maintained, and the financial
position was liquid. But so fast did
the company grow that only 15
months later it needed to raise $2.37
million from shareholders.
Most of the company’s growth has
been generated internally, with very few
takeovers (it does not care to buy other
people’s mistakes) and from a trebling
of cash flow since 1963. Since going
public, the company made a one-for-
two and a two-for-five par (50c) issue,
both in 1951, a three-for-five at 25c
premium in 1960, a one-for-four at 50c
premium in 1964, a $1,040,000 note
issue to shareholders in 1965, and the
recent one-for-four issue at the hefty
premium of 90c. (An added benefit was
the October, 1966, one-for-four bonus.)
The company has relied more on
mortgages and secured advances (about
$1 million in 1967), but long-term
liabilities represent only about 24 per-
cent of total long-term funds employed.
The 1967 current ratio of 1.4 was a
decline from 1963’s ratio of 1.9, and
presaged the call on shareholders for
further funds. Overdrafts had climbed
from $1.2 million to $2.2 million at the
same time that the company deposited
$l.l million on short term or at call.
Contracts in progress at cost less pro-
gress payments after providing for
profits on uncompleted work, had in-
creased from $2.2 million to $3.7 mil-
lion.
One item that is not consolidated into
the Jennings’ accounts is the $1 million
in Jennings Estates and Finance Ltd.,
which represents a 50 percent holding
(the remainder being equally held by
Email and Australian United Corpora-
tion).
There have been some changes in the
building industry itself that have been
to Jennings’ advantage, such as the im-
provement (be it gradual) in co-ordina-
tion of building regulations by authori-
ties. In 1963 Jennings maintained that
housing and general building costs were
at least 6 percent higher than necessary
on this score. Although there will always
be fluctuations in the industry, Jennings’
diversification helps to cushion any tem-
porary drying-up of housing finance,
industrial capital expenditure, or
governmental spending.
Another major change is that overseas
organisations anxious to get a foothold
in the local building industry, were, for
a time, prepared to undercut the local
established firms to the point of un-
profitability to secure prestige projects.
But Jennings has always sought profit
rather than prestige, and, following some
heavy losses here by foreign companies,
tenders are now being submitted by
overseas firms at more realistic prices.
Anyway, Jennings has withstood this
competition and consolidated its posi-
tion in the first rank of Australian
builders and constructors.
Since the recent one-for-four
premium issue, Jennings’ shares have
lifted 30c from their theoretical ex-
rights price of $2.12 two months ago,
and now yield only 2.5 percent on the
current 12 percent dividend, which must
be increased, one way or another, be-
fore long. The current earnings yield
of 8.8 percent still gives promise of
future benefits. Eventually this stock
must slow down; but it should keep up
its present pace for a fair while yet.

A pause in ARC’s expansion
NEW DEVELOPMENTS in reinforced
precast concrete units and prestressed
precast concrete units have further cut
into the domain of structural steel.
Reinforced concrete means good busi-
ness not only for the cement producers
but also for the steel reinforcement
people. Steel reinforcement consists of
shaped reinforcing bars and welded
mesh used to reinforce concrete in two
ways. In suspended beams and floor
slabs reinforcement is indispensable to
the point where the floor would collapse
without it. Welded fabric and shaped
bars enable the structural members to
carry their loads across wide spaces. In
vertical columns which support the
floor loads, by keeping the concrete size
unchanged and replacing only 4 percent
of this area by steel bars, the load-
carrying capacity of this column can
be doubled.
Reinforcing bars are bought as
straight, stock-length bars from BHP,
and in manufacturing are cut and bent
to the desired shapes to fit inside the
architectural concrete thicknesses. Bars
of various strengths are available up to
60,0001 b. per square inch. Welded
fabric is made from high-tensile wire
crosswelded into a mat form. The fac-
tory-shaped bars tend to be used in
heavily loaded columns and floor
beams; the welded-wire fabric is used
in floor slabs where the load is
uniformly applied. The rate of growth
in Australia for both shaped reinforc-
ing bars and reinforcing fabric is about
six percent a year.
ARC Industries Limited with 50 per-
cent plus of the Australian market for
steel reinforcing has been the front-
runner of the industry since its birth in
1920. B. F. Cox, the founder, started as
the Australian agent of the British Re-
inforced Concrete Engineering Co.
importing welded mesh from Britain,
and later was given the task of setting
up an Australian manufacturing base,
which was called Australian Reinforced
Concrete Engineering Co. BRC, part
of the Hall Engineering (Holdings)
Group of the U.K., was the major
shareholder, but Cox was the guiding
light.
ARC remained a subsidiary of the
UK group until 1947, when the British
shareholders felt there was no future in
Australia and sold their holding for a
sum believed to be about $200,000
ARC Industries was floated as a public
company in 1951, and today ranks in
the “Delfin Digest” directory among
the top 100 industrial enterprises in
Australia. K. F. Cox, the son of the
founder, is Chairman and Managing
Director, and at 57 has been in the
company’s employment for about 38
years. The average age of ARC’s top
executives below the Managing Director
is about 41 which gives the Company
plenty of vitality and scope for
expansion.
On a composition of turnover, which
in 1967 amounted to $36.7 million, steel
reinforcements would represent about
66 percent and the balance is made up
of precast concrete and welded mesh
for rural and industrial uses. With a
workforce of over 2000, ARC operates
a total of 24 factory units in Australia.
ARC Engineering, the subsidiary hand-
ling, reinforcing, and non-reinforcing
steel products has a chain of 19 fac-
tories three each in Victoria and
New South Wales, six in Queensland,
two each in South Australia and Tas-
mania, and one each in Western Aus-
tralia, Canberra, and Darwin.
In 1962, after having flirted with
the non-reinforcing mesh market and
seeing its potential in country fencing,
the Company aggressively entered this
field and is now a close runner-up to
Cyclone Co. of Australia in rural
fencing. With a rate of growth of 5
percent to 8 percent a year, ARC is a
major supplier of welded mesh to the
man on the land for applications such
as lamb marking yards, farm and field
gates, fixed and mobile sheep yards
and gates, cattle and pig yards, and
field fencing. Industrial fencing and
gates are also produced. In drought-
free times, rural fencing is a very good
money-spinner.
EPM Concrete, the ARC company
in precast concrete, operates two fac-
tories in Blacktown (Sydney) and
Sunshine (Melbourne) and is now the
largest Australian supplier of both
reinforced precast concrete and pre-
stressed precast concrete; these concrete
products are precast in the factory and
not on the site. Although this form of
construction is extensively used over-
seas, particularly for school buildings,
its use in Australia has been restricted
up to date, but indications are that
this technique may now become more
widely adopted.
ARC has won the contract to supply
precast concrete for the construction
of the new airport terminal buildings
at Tullamarine (Melbourne) and
Mascot (Sydney). EPM is doing well
in another area of precast slab concrete
in the supply of imitation marble,
known as “reconstructed granite,” used
in exterior cladding panels to beautify
buildings. EPM has the contract for
the exterior cladding of the Sydney
Opera House, which is to be in pink
granite and will be mounted on the
walls and paved areas this contract
is worth $2.8 million.
The ARC group also produces
insect screens in Sydney and Melbourne

The upward march in ARC’s
expansion was halted in 1967, when
the earned for ordinary plummeted
33.6 percent, compared with the peak
profit recorded in 1966. Part of the
decline was attributed to very keen
competition in steel reinforcements,
which led to severe price cutting. In
September, 1967, ARC acquired the
Steel Reinforcements division of Tube-
makers of Australia Limited at a cost
of $1.5 million cash, and in this
rationalisation move, prices of steel
reinforcements have now firmed aDout
12 percent.
The interim announcement in
February, 1968, indicating an unchanged
dividend rate reported a further decline
in profitability in the six months to
December, 1967, compared with the
similar period in 1966; the spectre of
drought persisting to a point of reduc-
ing many areas in south-east Australia
to near desert conditions is the main
cause of the further instability in net
earnings. Indications are that, given
good rains in May and June in Vic-
toria and Southern New South Wales,
ARC expects its earnings for the full
year to June, 1968, to approximate
that of 1967.
If the immediate short-term outlook
suggests a hesitancy in profit expan-
sion, my belief is that the long-term
picture which should begin to emerge
in 1969 is much more promising. BHP
is now an indirect shareholder in ARC
through a 7 percent interest held in
the company by Tubemakers of Aus-
tralia (BHP has a 42 percent interest
in TOA).
Summary: This is not a time to
buy ARC, but it is a stock to keep in
mind for the future. Long-term
investors are advised to sit on their
stock and hold. At 72 cents, the
dividend yield is 6.1 percent and the
price earnings multiple is 9.9.

Exoil and Transoil provide
the best of both worlds
THE INCREASING market popularity
accorded to Exoil (and its sister com-
pany Transoil) seems well founded. At
a time when most oil shares are selling
at near their paid-up value, and some at
prices well in excess of this figure, and
healthy premiums are being paid for
mineral exploration shares, the Exoil
group is in the happy position of being
able to provide the best of both worlds:
an interest in several interesting oil
leases and at the same time a consider-
able source of interest from its mineral
prospecting activities. Not only this,
but it also has a share in a proven
oilfield containing upwards of 300 mil-
lion barrels of oil. The combination
should be hard to resist, including as it
does, oil, uranium, and coal.
Both companies are relatively recent
comers to stock exchange lists, Exoil
having been formed in 1962 and Trans-
oil in 1964. But the interests which
they have built up since then have been
considerable, considering that there has
been no cash flow from any oilfield
earnings but only shareholders’ contri-
butions to capital which for the two
companies combined now stands at $6.8
million.
The group’s main asset is probably
its interest in the Mereenie anticline
which has been proved to be a large
reservoir of oil and natural gas. Exoil
has a 21 percent interest in this struc-
ture and Transoil 9 percent (Magellan
and Farmout also have interests in this
structure). The Mereenie No. 1 well
had to be abandoned in February, 1964,
due to mechanical difficulties after sus-
taining a flow of petroliferous gas at
the rate of 11 million cubic feet a day
over a period of two weeks. The next
well drilled on the structure was com-
pleted as a gas producer after flowing
for extended periods at a rate of 30
million cubic feet per day and giving
an open-flow potential of 60 million
cubic feet per day.
Three further wells were completed
as potential gas and condensate pro-
ducers after penetrating a column of
oilsands 350 feet thick, but it was not
until the sixth well, East Mereenie
No. 4, that a flow of oil was obtained.
This well suffered some damage to the
formation which necessitated special
work, but, by stimulation of selected
zones, a flow of between 300 and 350
barrels per day was achieved using gas
lift. Calculations based on pressure
data from drill stem tests indicated
that production could have been higher
if hydraulic fracturing had been com-
pletely successful. The Mereenie struc-
ture has been estimated to contain
300 million barrels in the more porous
zones (the sands are generally very
tight and do not yield their oil easily),
and further wells are planned to con-
tinue the investigation of this area.
Southern Pacific Petroleum N.L., the
company recently floated under the
sponsorship of Magellan, is to parti-
cipate in the drilling of the North-west
Mereenie No. 1 well which it is hoped
will encounter sands with better pro-
duction characteristics than the
previous Mereenie wells, but this well
will be outside the area in which
Exoil and Transoil have interests.
Two hundred and fifty miles to the
south of the Mereenie field (which is
situated just south of Alice Springs) the
Exoil group has an interest in OEL 28
in the proportions Exoil 35 percent,
Transoil 15 percent, Continental Oil 25
percent, and Australian Sun Oil 25
percent. Surveys completed last August
delineated an anticline containing a
closure with an area of about 70 square
miles. This structure is believed to con-
tain sediments similar to those which
produced oil and gas at Mereenie, and
the companies hold out better than
average chances for the well, which is to
be drilled on this structure before the
end of June, to be the Munyarai No. 1.
This confidence seems justified in view
of the above-average record to date of
commercial discoveries per well drilled.
In addition to its interest in this well,
the group also has an interest in wells
drilled on leases in Queensland (76P.
126 P, on shore, and 70P offshore), in
the Nakoro anticline in Papua, and in a
small area of the Sydney Basin, where,
some years ago, Exoil earned a 50 per-
cent interest in a 197-square-mile block
from AOG in return for deepening an
existing well at Kurrajong Heights from
4756 ft. to 11,000 ft. With the exception
of the last two areas, all the others
mentioned have been the subject of
fairly recent work, the 126 P lease in
Queensland containing the Alliance
Group’s Penjobe No. 1 well, which,
although scheduled to 5000 ft., was ter-
minated at 1828 ft. in non-prospective
sediments only a few weeks ago. Exoil
and Transoil each had a 15 percent
interest in this well.
The Penjobe well was located 23
miles south-west of the town of Spring-
sure, where Uranium Consolidated has
deposits of bentonite. Although not con-
nected with this venture, the Exoil
Group joined with Uranium Consoli-
dated earlier this year in obtaining an
option over mineral leases at Peak Hill,
near Mount Morgan. The Many Peaks
mine operated for several years earlier
this century as a producer of copper/
gold ore, and also produced flux for
the Mount Morgan smelter. The group
intends to test the potential of the area
and will share in the proportions of
Exoil 55 percent, Transoil 25 percent,
and Uranium Consolidated 20 percent.
A rather more exciting mineral pros-
pect is the 3300-square-mile mineral
lease held north-west of Toowoomba,
held 50 percent by Exoil and 50 percent
by Transoil. This lease was taken up
in August last year, and so far recon-
naissance drilling has intersected seams
of coal up to ten feet in thickness.
While any evaluation will have to wait
on the results of detailed drilling after
the initial scout drilling has been com-
pleted, the area is well serviced by rail
and is attractively sited close to Bris-
bane.
As far as the share market is con-
cerned the group’s most attractive
interest at present is its 90 percent of
the action at the Mount Painter
uranium prospect. (Each company has
a 45 percent interest.) Mt. Painter is
some 350 miles north of Adelaide, and
for many years has been known to
contain several uranium and rare-earth
prospects. These deposits contain large
quantities of low-grade ore and pre-
liminary drilling gave an average value
of I.Blb. uranium oxide per long ton
from ten to fifty feet. Further drilling
has shown grades of up to 31b. per ton
which compares pretty well with the
3.361 b. mined at Mary Kathleen in its
first year, but the average grade of the
deposit has not been anywhere near
sufficient for commercial operations at
the current price of around $8 per lb.
compared with the $l2 per lb. price
which was current when Mary Kathleen
Uranium began mining. It will never-
theless be interesting to see what the
full tonnage of this deposit comes out
at from the point of view of increasing
total Australian reserves to the extent
required before the Commonwealth
Government relaxes its export embargo.
In the same area the group has another
uranium prospect which has shown
encouraging assays in the five holes so
far assayed out of 12 drilled to date.
Both the extent and average grade of

the mineralised zone have yet to be
determined, and it will take a few
months to determine the viability of this
deposit, named the “Armchair” after its
topographic resemblance to that piece
of furniture.
With all these interests, shares in the
Exoil/Transoil group appear quite
cheap even at today’s prices which
follow strong buying during past weeks.
Like many other oil shares with call
liabilities of various amounts, there are
anomalies between the price of fully
paid and contributing shares, but at
around 50c for TransoiFs 15c-paid
shares and 33c for Exoil’s 30c-
paid shares, the two companies have a
combined market value of less than $lO
million which is quite modest com-
pared with some of the other oil and
mineral situations on the lists.
As mentioned above, the market at
present is obviously more interested in
the group’s uranium than its oil, and
current prices bear this out; both com-
panies are valued at close to $5 million
(after allowing for the exercise of the
Exoil options), reflecting the equal
interests held by each company in the
coal and uranium prospects. This
valuation probably errs in neglect-
ing the unequal interests held in the
Mereenie oil/'gas structure where Exoil
has a 21 percent and Transoil a 9 per-
cent interest, and in the prospective
Munyarai No. 1 well in which Exoil
is to have a 35 percent interest and
Transoil a 15 percent interest.
TWO COMPANIES in the West have
been accused of saying one thing and
meaning another. For Paris Gold Mines
Pty. Ltd. it did not come off. The
company applied for 18 goldmining
leases south of Coolgardie, claiming
that gold would be the objective, pos-
sibly an extension of the Paris lode.
But, the Warden’s Court at Cool-
gardie was told the facts by Norseman
Gold Mines NL, which spilt the beans;
a circular to its shareholders left no
doubt that nickel, not gold, was the ob-
jective under an arrangement between
Paris and Norseman. And the tene-
ments were encroaching on Western
Mining Corporation nickel leases. Ob-
jection upheld.
The other company so accused is
Texada Mines Ltd. A January applica-
tion for permission to export salt from
Texada’s project at Lake MacLeod,
20 miles north of Carnarvon, was re-
jected by the Western Australian Gov-
ernment. Since then the company’s
plans for a $l3 million potash plant
have been put forward 15 months, and
the Government has acknowledged that
salt will be a by-product of this
operation. The Tokyo trade papers, re-
porting on this, assess it without
in any way denouncing it as a
strategy to get salt out quickly during
a period of high prices.

THE LAND
Help Asia’s secondaries first
THE AUSTRALIAN Institute of
Agricultural Science has proposed the
establishment of an “Australian Insti-
tute for Overseas Agricultural Develop-
ment.” Its intended purpose is to aid
South-East Asia by undertaking agri-
cultural research, extension, and edu-
cation in the countries comprising that
region. $300,000 will be enough to
get the new Institute launched and its
minimum running costs thereafter will
be $600,000 a year, the planners say.
While this may be sufficient to buy us
some goodwill in Asia, it certainly
cannot achieve much else, the odds
being as they are.
Hopefully, the money for the Insti-
tute v/ill be coaxed out of certain
government departments, various
public organisations, private firms,
overseas philanthropic foundations, and
the general public. The Department of
External Affairs, for one, has already
lent a sympathetic ear to the schemers
and has appointed an agricultural
scientist to its staff. His first job will
entail searching for an amenable
project for the Institute to tackle in
South-East Asia.
At the l'ecent ECAFE conference in
Canberra, the Indonesian Foreign Min-
ister, Mr. Malik, told the delegates
that the advanced countries must
respond quickly to Asia’s distress, in
their own interests. Humanitarian
motives should suffice for attempting to
uplift the economies of these peoples.
The question to answer is how can the
developed countries lend genuinely
effective aid?
Malik rightly praised Australia for
being the first of the developed coun-
tries to grant general preferences to
imports from developing countries.
(His praise, incidentally, is rather
understated because Australia is not a
“developed” country like the U.S. or
Japan.) The Japanese delegation saw
the point immediately and was quickly
up on the bandwagon, pointing out
that 40 percent of Japan’s imports
come from the poor countries of Asia.
Like ourselves, Japan knows that
trade is the key to progress in the
struggling communities. Trade pro-
vides capital and permits industrial
development, which must precede
agricultural advancement.
Modern agriculture is not merely
test-tubes and know-how. It demands
inputs fertilisers, power, construc-
tions, stud stock, insecticides, herbi-
cides, and so on. History tells that
in the developed countries agricultural
, ,
abundance came only after industrial
success and usually long after. With
outside help this time lag need not .be
so long in South-East Asia, but in-
dustnal growth must come, first.
eiefore, Australian aid at this stage
should be directed solely toward the
secondary sector of the Asian economies
and to geneial education, not just agn-
cultural education.
While a country’s industrial pro-
i • j- , u . r .

of people in the developing countries
and not only from the increasing num-
bers of mouths. Given industrial
growth and access to markets, there-
fore, these countries could eventually
afford to buy food from the agricul-
turally successful countries.
Accordingly, Australia’s role for the
foreseeable future is to keep enlarging
the volume of her food production. We
already have much of the know-how
and the economic and industrial
capacity to do this. The only real
problems concern the disposal of the
harvests and reimbursement of the
farmers. And these are matters for
political scientists rather than agri-
cultural scientists. Lesser difficulties are
the lack of an effective extension ser-
vice and an educational system which
would turn out keen and receptive farm
managers. Money invested in extension,
education, and research in Australia can
produce many times the amount of food
that the same investment can yield in
Asia.
Australia’s food technologists possibly
could make an appreciable impact at
this time if they were to export their
knowledge and skills to South-East
Asia. Much of the food grown there
rots before it can be eaten and the
nutritive value of much more of it
could be improved artificially. Food
additives such as vitamins and minerals
are cheap in comparison to their value
in the diet when properly employed.
Many of the arts of food processing
are not so difficult or costly that
Asians could not set about implement-
ing them right away on a signifi-
cant scale.
Improving breeds by computer
COMPUTERS HAVE been grazing
here and there in the Australian pastoral
industry for some time, so it wasn’t
exactly novel for the domestic Hereford
, U , r .
breeders to hear from an opposite num-
ber from America, in Sydney recently,
that as well as being used for pedigree
records as they are here, in the United
States breeder societies saw a big future
for them in establishing new guide-
lines for cattle-breeding, in keeping
records of comparison in conformation,
weight - gaining, and productiveness
potential, and generally putting breeding
on a surer scientific foundation. Whereas
the show ring could give breeders a
comparison of only a* few beasts, you
could throw the vital statistics of thous-
ands of them into a computer and come
up with a much more desirable beast
of thp future
. ' . ..
Meanwhile, a South Austialian
grazier, Peter Rymill, was taking a close
look at the limits of conformation as a
guide to cattle-breeding. Rymill doesn’t
think highly of the practical expertise
of Australian cattle-breeders, but neither
will all the latter agree that to get the
best beasts from the material available
you’ve got to mix lots of breeds to-
S ethe f if the aim is to progress through
selection. As he put it, though, you
have to start out on the road toward
tti a t beef herd b getting suit _
able genetic mater ial, then select for a
rapid rate of i mprov ement in the herd,
and g 0 on to a p o i n t where criss-cross
breeding was necessary, as with poultry,
to get any further improvement. He
advocated the creation of “a thorough
genetic mess-mess,” the furtherance of
hybrid vigor by cross-breeding, but be-
hind the whole program the fullest
knowledge (computerised?) of what w^as
going into the criss-cross,
Rymill appears to have come to this
position not only by practical experience
°n his property at Penola, in South
Australia, but also from deep study of
the variables an d constants in the prob-
lem of selection. The big constant was
that researcb bad shown the amount
of muscle in bee f carcasses of specified
weight remains constant at around 55
percent. This being so, then in his view
conformation is of no value in gauging
the productive potential of a normal
beef animal; that is, one not having

conformation faults which would obvi-
ously detract from its ability to produce
beef. However, as he stated, research
has shown considerable variation be-
tween breeds in the muscle-bone ratio
in beef carcasses, irrespective of carcass
weight, and he gave an example of this
to the effect that the ratio for Brahman
was 3.66 to one, of Angus 3.64, half-
Brahman 3.44, Hereford 3.18, Northern
Territory scrubber Shorthorn 3.08, and
Polled Hereford 2.92.
Over the whole range of possibilities
the number of variations in muscle-
bone ratio is extensive, and the scope
for cross-breeding to get a more pro-
ductive beef animal will be a function
of it. As we’ll have the means to
measure these muscle-bone ratios and
to handle the measurements with a
computer, clearly the rest of the selec-
tion process will be straightforward.
Mr. Rymill thinks that ratios of five to
one could be achieved, along with
double muscling. Moreover, he says it
had already been shown that the selec-
tion of sires for weight gain by itself
would not unduly affect the conforma-
tion of the progeny, and that in the
United States a strong correlation had
been established between weight gain
and the grade of the carcass.
All this seems to point to the advis-
ability of widening the selection of
breeding types, just as it does to com-
puterisation. On the former front it
was interesting to see that while over
here for the Sydney Royal, Mr. J. H.
Rutherford, president of the N.Z. Royal
Agricultural Society and also of the
United Stud Breeders’ Association had
talks with Government and Breed
Society officials on a scheme for the
exchange of good breeding stock be-
tween Australia and N.Z., a sort of
livestock version of the Australia-N.Z.
Free Trade Agreement. Supporters of
the scheme reckon that such an ex-
change scheme for cattle and sheep
offers more in the way of trade betweeri.
the two countries than many of the
items listed in the Free Trade Agree-
ment.
Even so, at this stage the gentle-
men from N.Z. are not giving anything
away. As Rutherford said, though, his
talks were highly encouraging. “I will
not enter into any partisan discussions
on which breeds need an exchange, but
most breeders who have been in both
countries will know where gains can
be made.” Until now the only stock,
apart from a few merinos, that New
Zealand imported from Australia were
Tasmanian cattle. One of the main
blocks to traffic in that direction in the
past has been the presence of pleuro-
pneumonia in a few isolated areas in
the Northern Territory, but that was no
longer as bad a problem as it had
been. Rutherford said that provided
these areas were defined and safe-
guards guaranteed, people on his side
of the Tasman were ready to talk on
the matter.


ART AND ENTERTAINMENT
The good and the awful
By DENIS O'BRIEN
I AM JUST back from a busy inspec-
tion of Sydney theatre five produc-
tions in six days. As entertainment,
one was uncomplicatedly good, two
were flat, one was worthless, and one
was hideously fascinating. As art, one
was hideously fascinating.
I was fascinated—as a rabbit is by a
snake—for all but about ten minutes
of Edward Bond’s slice of pockmarked
realism called “Saved” before its
hideousness drove me into the fresh
air. No one easily revolted by realism
on the stage should expose a small toe
to this play; anyone interested in the
theatre’s convoluted determination to
express itself on society’s ills in any-
thing but plain language might find it
worth a token visit.
The play is produced by Aarne
Neeme as a collaborative effort by the
University of Sydney Drama Society
and the Drama Society of the Univer-
sity of New South Wales. It is playing
from April 24 to May 11 at the Union
Theatre and from May 16 to 18 at the
U.N.S.W. theatrette. As a production,
it is the best I have ever seen from a
student body. The crude grubbiness
and disgusting rawness of the play is
so forcibly represented by the cast that
it becomes difficult to separate their
fact from Bond’s fiction. (He’ll hate
that; in a few thousand words he says
fiis play is a slice of life.)
Bond’s pessimistic view of life is
shown through the social and moral
irresponsibility of his characters: a drab
whore who neglects her baby, a gang
of vicious louts who stone it to death
in its perambulator, a weak-minded
boarder who masturbates after failing
to make it with the whore’s mother, a
father who yielded his spine as the
price for peace and quiet.
The meaning of it all was beyond my
Intellectual scope; only the force of
the acting kept me in my seat.
The Old Tote’s season of Australian
plays continued with a new one from
Alexander Buzo, a 24-year-old Sydney
student, and the adaptation of Doug-
las Stewart’s radio play “Fire On the
Snow.” The double-bill made a flat
evening.
Stewart’s play was not written for
visual performance, and Tom Brown’s
attempt to add the dimension only
achieved dull pretentiousness. Mr. Buzo
scraped at some of the superficialities
of tolerance in a dialogue between a
Norm Everage Australian and a
Pakistani student. It is an earnestly
honest piece of work, but to me it only
seemed to satisfy the playwright’s own
social conscience.
Phillip Adams already has reviewed
the J. C. Williamson production of Bill
Naughton’s “Spring and Port Wine.” It
hasn’t improved on its move to Sydney
from Melbourne.
The Williamson management should
be wishing it had bought the produc-
tion rights to the much better comedy
“The Anniversary,” the Bill Mcllwraith
play which was among the Adelaide
Festival attractions and which has now
been added to the Independent
Theatre’s repertory season. This simple
tale of a bossily possessive mother’s
last-ditch stand to maintain her
matriarchy over her three sons and
their women is played with uninhibited
comic momentum and skilfully guided
by producer Peter Summerton. The
Independent’s repertory company dis-
plays a splendid versatility in switch-
ing with such smooth naturalness from
its earlier dramas to comedy and at
present is almost alone in giving Syd-
ney theatre an attractiveness.
There is little that attracts in the
Community Theatre’s second produc-
tion a revival of Noel Coward’s 33-
year-old comedy of manners, “Hay
Fever.” Alexander Archdale’s produc-
tion does not validate the revival; he
has simply dressed his company and
his stage in uncertain ’twenties
fashions and left it at that. Looked at
through a cover for embarrassment it
reminded me so much of an amateur
production I saw 20 years ago that I
left after the second act.
Films
Games that publicists play
By BEVERLEY TIVEY
Night Games. Director, Mai Zetter-
ling.
You're A Big Boy Now. Director,
Francis Ford Coppola.
OBSCENE. Depraved. Scabrous. When
advance reports of a movie are filled
with words like this, one approaches it
with pleasurable alarm. But for a film
that’s struck censorship trouble practic-
ally everywhere, Mai Zetterling’s
“Night Games” turns out to be an
awful let-down. It’s not really very
shocking. And it’s not much of a
movie, either.
Our local censor has made cuts,
certainly, but I believe they only total
74 feet, which adds up to very little
in screening time; and since there are
no obvious gaps in continuity it doesn’t
seem as if anything of importance had
been cut out. Technically, it’s a film of
great, though superficial, efficiency,
well photographed and deftly con-
structed in its pattern of interlocking
flashbacks. But it isn’t likely to shock
or startle or even make you think.
The theme, though simple and
unoriginal, is valid enough. A young
man brings his fiancee to his childhood
home, only to be bedevilled by
memories of his beautiful, capricious
mother. She’s evidently supposed to
represent the current scarecrow, the
Cannibal Mother, but really she
doesn’t seem so bad: in the person of
Ingrid Thulin she’s the best-looking
person in the film and also the only
one who seems to be having anything
approaching a good time. The mourn-
ful young man and his solemn fiancee
are not an appealing pair, and the
hard-working participants in those
dismal orgies add up to the dreariest
set of party guests in history.
Bouncing into Sydney with none of
the Swedish film’s scandalous pub-
licity in fact, with no publicity at
all “You’re A Big Boy Now” turns
out to be one of the pleasantest sur-
prises of the year. Curiously enough
its theme is similar the efforts oT
a youth to break away from parental
smothering and create his own identity.
But here it’s presented in a likable
and lighthearted way the battle
between the generations is seen as a
normal incident in everyone’s growing-
up, not as the seed of neurosis, guilt,
and gloom.
Coppola has inexhaustible comic
invention, and though he occasionally
becomes a little too way-out in his
humor, he’s mercifully free from the
“watch the clever boy!” self-
consciousness too common with reso-
lutely mod directors. He deals effec-
tively with a strikingly able cast, and
young Peter Kastner, seen at a recent
Film Festival in the Canadian “No-
body Waved Goodbye,” confirms the
impression gained from that movie of
talent and youthful charm.
There is a substratum of good,


sound sense in the film’s skittish
examination of the parent-child rela-
tionship. When the big boy of the
title is suspected of attacking his land-
lady the poor woman has had a
fall in the course of one of the compli-
cated disasters that beset our hero’s
path his parents badger him with
the question: “Why did you attack
Miss Thing?” Nobody even thinks of
saying “did you . . .” or asking for his
version of the story.
Theatre
Unpretentious
by JOHN CARGHER
Pecsi Hungarian Gipsy Orchestra.
Comedy Theatre, Melbourne.
ANYONE expecting the Budapest
Philharmonic backing stars of opera
and ballet is in for a shock. The
.greatest asset of this company is the
charm of a slight unprofessionalism;
the artists cannot hide the fact that
they are enjoying themselves and smile
sheepishly at the applause which is
showered on them. Twelve violins con-
stantly playing in unison, with casual
variations in pitch, produce exactly the
kind of sound a Hungarian gipsy
orchestra should produce. To criticise
the practice on the grounds of musical
monotony is as idiotic as the un-
grammatical program’s claim that
Pecsi “has utilised the works of Kodaly
and Bartok to great advantage.” Any
resemblance to the works of the great
Hungarian classics masters is purely
coincidental.
Taken as pure entertainment, the
Pecsi Hungarian Gipsy Orchestra must
be rated first-class by any standards.
Hungarian folk music has always had a
great popular following among Western
audiences and most of the works played
are well known and well loved. The
twelve - piece solo violin is backed by
two vital cymbaloms, larger string in-
struments, and one clarinet. The sound
produced is thoroughly satisfying. Joszef
Pecsi leads with the usual acrobatic
pizzicati and bird-noise solos on his
violin and there is a remarkably mellow
cello played by Arpad Raduly, who
competes with Pecsi in some spectacular
fingering which seems to extend even
beyond the end of his cello’s finger-
ing board. A remarkable virtuoso, but
the beautiful tone Raduly draw's from
his instrument is even more likely to
bring the house down with “The Swan.”
The singers and dancers bring neces-
sary relief from the static picture of
the orchestra. Imre Bojtor is a fine
baritone with enormous charm, and
Klementina Horvath (Mrs. Pecsi) and
Ferenc Beres turn out to be delightful
comedians in song. The eight lovely
and masculine (respectively) dancers
provide a variety of styles and costumes
in numerous items. There is room in
our antipodean lives for unpretentious
entertainment of this kind.
Art
Among the
problem-setters
By ELWYN LYNN
Jon Molvig, Rudy Komon Gallery,
Sydney.
John Peart. Watters Gallery, Sydney.
JON MOLVIG and John Peart are
problem-setters, the former dealing in
cryptic symbols, the latter in pale,
ephemeral paintings that often contain
the merest suggestion of shapes but are,
nonetheless, symbols in themselves.
Molvig has never really rejected his
expressionistic preoccupations; most of
his career has been concerned with the
expression of his feelings in their coin-
cidence with the anguished essences of
wild, yellow horses, hazy saloon
drinkers, faded stockmen, and loose
nudes. With the flat, smudged figures,
shovel-headed and gaunt, of his Indus-
trial Eden a title no less ironic than
the present one for this series, The Tree
of Man he began to employ object-
ive symbols, much less expressive of his
own attitudes. His cavorting, levitated,
gossamer-thin and emaciated nudes
of 1966 were so urgently angular that
they began to resemble ideograms of
human fragility.
Shallow adherents of realism think
it’s easy to tell what realistic paintings
are about, but their import and meaning
witness Boyd and Nolan can be
as elusive as those of abstract painters
and certainly what Molvig is pursuing
in these ten untitled works with, usually,
a grey or black rib-cage that’s also a
scheme of a leafless tree, involved with
a target, is indeed enigmatic. It’s im-
mediately felt that the targets bear
overtones that a Jasper Johns or a Ken-
neth Noland would suppress, for these
hoops around a central disc deal with
eternal persistence, the wheel of life
turning full circle or an undeviating
continuity that is opposed and denied
by the fleshless, depersonified skeletons.
Black, the rib-cage may leap into
transient life as it crosses a silvery circle;
in a world grown rich with maroon it
fades to a shadow; or against grey is
suspended horizontally, the ribs reach-
ing like roots or groping against a
granite sky.
The consummation and purposeful-
ness of the target are emphasised in
several works where the rib-cage had
disappeared, and in the first of the
series the skeleton-tree floats on matt-
black above a silky - black, which
reflects the viewer as if through a glass
darkly, and where the circle, which
heals into wholeness in other paintings
in the series, is split vertically. (The
semi-mirror surfaces of the Italian,
Pistoletto, attempt to involve one’s
image as well as one’s feelings in his
paintings and raise new problems about
identifying oneself with, or in, the paint-
ing.)
The best paintings (each is 48in.
square and costs from $lBOO to $2000)
have the intimate remoteness of
oriental works with their fusing of the
fragile with the intractable and posi-
tive sign, but these are far less
ingratiating works and have a lean,
poverty-stricken air, accentuated by the
dark grey and grim black grounds. One
rib-cage has a red heart, but its signifi-
cance is indicated by its replacement in
another work by the black ace of
spades, as though what makes you tick
depends upon a turn of the cards; the
dour show recalls T. S. Eliot’s interest
in the Tarot cards and man’s drab
misery. Apparently matters are much
better, when in Number Five, a grey
tree of man is securely balanced on a
grey semi-circle to symbolise the har-
mony between transitoriness and the
eternal round of existence, but it’s a
curious sign, half-pagan, half-Christian,
and could be carried on shields in
“Macbeth” or, better still, in “Throne
of Blood,” Japanese version.
Peart’s exhibition is the most
minimal we have seen: Cool Corner
is a shallowly scooped canvas moving
imperceptibly from palest green at the
corners to egg-shell-blue in the misty
interior; Long Blue Diagonal (about
48in. square and $150) is a ghostly
Saint Andrew’s Cross on white; Cool
Diagonal Corner has pale, feathery-
green triangles pointed from the
corners into a white so uninflected that
the atmosphere between the uniform
color and the observer begins to make
the white flicker. Others, equally pale
and wan, have slightly stronger sug-
gestions of form but, as with most
minimal art, the shape of the
the thing itself, is the form. They are
cool and ghostly rather than hygienic
and clinical, and they resemble bas-
reliefs not much different from the
wall that supports them. The trouble
is, says Clement Greenberg, that
“Minimal Art remains too much a
feat of ideation and not enough any-
thing else. Its idea reihains an idea,
something deduced instead of felt and
discovered.” There is, as he says, no
surprise, and their deadpan surfaces
disguise no metaphysical content. Peart
docs make many of the local new
abstractionists look aggressively mus-
cular or fussily complicated, but some
might find his works too soft and
downy, like marshmallows. They are, in
fact, like square clouds of velvety
talcum powder, but with just enough
pungency to resist the charge that they
are pictorial tranquillisers. They are a
vast improvement on his former
calligraphic signs, but one feels that
there is a rewarding area between his
new bitter-sweet simplicities and Mol-
vig’s simple but cryptic symbols.


COMMUNICATING
FACTS AND OPINIONS ON ARTS CRAFTS AND COMMUNICATIONS
DON'T SHOOT THE CRITIC
CRITICISM of a self-analytical kind
is a characteristic of the educated Aus-
tralian; at home or abroad he flagellates
himself and his fellow Australians in
a search for national identity, purpose,
meaning, and value until he bleeds
boredom. He is accepted in his dubious
role as a sort of national conscience.
Yet the Australian practising the art
of theoretical criticism in the arts is
regarded neither as a prophet nor a
yardstick in his own backyard. The
professional critic often finds his judi-
cious opinions misinterpreted and dis-
missed with a snort by such airy oracles
of mass communication as Andrea, or
rendered superfluous by authors and
actors who cling defensively to that
lying line, “I never read my reviews.”
But it is not so much that the serious
critic has difficulty in being taken
seriously in Australia, more that he is
retreating to an intellectual vacuum.
God knows how effective he’ll be there
in the coming McLuhanland; already
the language of criticism is inadequate
for the revolution.
Don’t shoot the critic yet, though;
he is making some attempt to break
out and join up. Self-help is at hand
in an ambitious seminar on criticism
in the arts, sponsored by the Australian
National Advisory Committee for
UNESCO and to be housed for a
week this month in the University of
Sydney’s Merewether Building.
In prospect, the seminar has a faintly
intimidating air of self-importance and
polysyllables, but there seems no doubt
that it represents a genuine effort to
signpost modern Australian criticism
and to reappraise its functions and
values.
The seminar will encompass concur-
rent discussions on literature, the visual
arts, drama and theatre, music and,
most necessarily, film and television.
One paper in that section is entitled
“The qualifications and responsibilities
of the film, radio, and television critics,”
which might provide the long-awaited
answer to the $64 question.
Organisers are pleased with the local
response, claiming that “up to 100
leading Australian critics, academics,
and creative artists will attend the
seminar,” but in making their count
organisers might have failed to make
the distinction between “critics” and
“reviewers,” a demarcation which the
seminar itself could usefully apply as
an incidental aside.
THE FLAVOR OF CHIPS
THE INERTIA induced by some
recent editions of “This Day Tonight”
meant that we did not get to our feet
quickly enough to turn off the ABC’s
"The Girl From Uncle.” This, in
turn, meant that we noticed Chips
Rafferty’s name among the players.
We had known that Rafferty, after
his years of slogging through mostly
fairly poor films, had now reached the
idyllic state of working a few months
of the year in American television and
idling away the rest of his life in Aus-
tralian sunshine. However, what
seemed remarkable from a standard
piece of television was what American
producers have done with our Chips,
or, perhaps, what he himself has quite
brilliantly refined his standard dinkum
Aussie character into.
In “The Girl From Uncle” he was
Liverpool Henry, the offsider of the
uncrowned white king of a Pacific
island, Lost Paradise. There were
cockney overtones in the character, but
Chips’ “Stone the flamin’ crows” and
“Good on yer, mateys” were coming
through loud and clear. It was, in
fact, a perfect parody of the Chips
of “The Overlanders,” and, in fact, as
good a parody of his early screen self
as we have seen any actor do since
Victor Mature in “After the Fox.”
Why doesn’t some local producer,
intent on getting overseas sales, talk
Rafferty into a series? He is probably
our most experienced screen actor. He
is the only one who could still do a
good, robust bushwhacker, preferably
well hammed up. He could serve as a
picturesque contrast between the older
Australia and the new one of big
mineral discoveries and major develop-
ment. He is also perhaps as well known
in some overseas countries as kangaroos.
FOCUS ON A SHORTAGE
WHEN Australia was still just talking
about the need for a local film industry
we were assured that whatever might be
lacking in the way of local finance and
distribution, there was an abundance
of talent just rearing to go.
Now, with series like “Skippy”
bouncing along and a few features in
production, it seems that the industry
enthusiasts were overstating the case.
Already there’s a serious shortage of
qualified technicians, for the simple
reason that we had very few to begin
with.
England and America entered tele-
vision production with the backing,
however reluctant, of established film
industries. In fact, the slump in feature
production caused by the new medium’s
impact provided a large surplus work-
force of fully trained directors, editors,
and cameramen.
However, when it was test-pattern
time in Australia most of the film people
we had fell into two broad categories:
relics of the Cinesound era and half-
trained youngsters. And amid those on
their last legs and those taking their
first unsteady steps there were, perhaps,
a dozen cameramen worthy of the
name. For the term is applied very
loosely in Australia. It is meant to de-
scribe a man qualified to light a scene
and direct photography. Locally, it is
applied to camera operators, who, in
the words of one disgruntled profes-
sional, “couldn’t light a bulb.”
In Europe and America a hopeful
invariably begins as a humble clapper-
boy, graduating to grip and camera
operator. With luck and talent, he
might finish up a cameraman in feature
or series TV work.
Lacking a feature industry or in-
stitutions capable of training profes-
sional cinematographers, Australia is
therefore doubly disadvantaged. Thus,
many costly commercials and documen-
taries are now at the tender mercies
of people with just a few years’ train-
ing in basic 16mm.
And some of the strain is eased be-
cause the free-and-easy camerawork of
television documentary has tended to
widen technical tolerances and write
new rules. Effects which once would
have been considered appalling such
as lens flare and wobbly hand-held
movement can now be considered the
essence of visual elegance.
We have the incongruous situation,
from time to time, of seeing a tradit-
ional cameraman being forced to
shake his camera or point it into the
lights; which is like expecting a Royal
Academician to ride a bicycle over his
canvas.
In American features the camera-
man often has the letters ASC after his
name. They stand for the American
Society of Cinematographers, and the
right to use them is jealously guarded.
Its local counterpart, the Australian
Cinematographers’ Society, is equally
determined to sustain standards, so the
right to the suffix ASC after one’s
name is a privilege which they’ve
granted to few men; and some of those
are no longer active in the business.
Recognising the crisis, the Society
is planning to introduce classes for
young camera operators working in

Music
Advancing
Australians
By PAUL FROLICH
RECENTLY I have heard three
demonstrations of the gradual emer-
gence of an independence in our
musical life. First there was the Mitta-
gong Festival, resting entirely on the
efforts of our local performers and
inviting the participation of two con-
temporary Australian composers. The
next event was the season’s first concert
by the Sydney branch of the Inter-
national Society for Contemporary
Music.
This program comprised eight
works: two from Poland, three from
the U.S., and three local ones. The
importations did not, overall, put the
local work to shame. Penderecki’s
“Stabat Mater” was a most impressive
piece. It is scored for three choirs, and
proved devoutly fine religious music,
proving that a modern idiom need not,
of itself, be alien to our traditions and
emotions. The other Polish work, a
piece for flute and piano, was slow, dull,
and had little to do with music, as I
understand the term. Equally undis-
tinguished, in their various ways, were
“Acquaintances,” for flute, double bass,
and piano, by Roger Reynolds and Mor-
ton Feldman’s “Durations,” a slow suc-
cession of sounds which seemed to lack
all coherence and purpose, though indis-
putably of considerable duration. The
U.S. was redeemed by a Trio, for flute,
violin, and double bass,' by William
Sydeman, a work of unashamed
lyricism. Flautist Peter Richardson per-
formed remarkable feats which often
seemed worthy of a better cause.
The Australian composers pro-
grammed were all products of the
University of Sydney’s Music Depart-
ment. Anne Boyd, writing for two
choirs, prepared piano, and percussion,
offered her new motet “Alma Redemp-
toris Mater,” the first piece of hers
known to me which is free of trickery;
it is definitely individual, and a strong
indication that Miss Boyd really cares
for music and will continue to have
something to say. The work is based on
plainsong and I found the music very
moving, particularly by the manner in
which the composer has retained traces
of that mysticism which can never be
wholly absent from sincerely made
sacred music.
“Songs of Love,” by Alison Bauld, a
cycle for soprano and six instrumen-
talists (strings, winds, and percussion)
introduced a young Sydney composer
previously not known to me. The three
songs of the cycle, excellently presented
by Marissa Brumby, abound in interest-
ing sonorities and show a sound know-
ledge of fugal traditions. One did not,
at any stage, experience the irritation so
often aroused by the experimentation of
young composers.
Another local work was by Barry
Conyngham; titled “Farben” and
scored for two choirs, it might best be
described as an essay in the sound and
imagined color values of particular
words. Mr. Conyngham, as yet a stu-
dent in every sense, does not, at this
stage, reveal any personal element in
his writing; all the same, the gimmicky
nature of his piece did not hide the
fact that he has reached a degree of
technical competence and is genuinely
intrigued by the things the human voice
can accomplish. We must be grateful
to Professor Peart, conducting most
of this concert, for bringing these
young writers forward.
The third demonstration of our
growing emancipation was a “Mozart
Concerto Concert” at the University of
Sydney’s Great Hall. Organised by the
New Sydney Woodwind Quintet and
conducted by Robert Pikler in quite
favorable acoustic conditions, this
event was notable for the capacity
audience. The chamber orchestra, in-
cluding only a handful of members of
the SSO, played at a standard we
rarely hear. The outstanding impres-
sion was that made by Mr. Pikler, who,
conducting with meticulous attention
to the least detail in phrasing and
tempi, proved to be the ideal accom-
panist.
The concert opened with the rarely
heard “Sinfonia Concertante” for oboe,
clarinet, bassoon, horn, and orchestra.
It is really a concerto for wind quartet
with orchestra, and the four soloists—
Guy Henderson, Donald Westlake,
John Cran, and' Clarence Meller
played with superb skill, beauty of
tone, and care for every detail. The
braying of the wind instruments in the
opening movement was delightfully
offset by the velvety tone of the strings.
The Menuet was taken at a commend-
ably fast pace, the slow movement with
sensuous languor, and final variations
emerged full of humor and joy.
The other works were the Piano
Concerto No. 17, in G major, a seldom-
played one, with highly competent
Beryl Potter as soloist, and the great
Clarinet Concerto. Mr. Pikler’s con-
ducting in this was of delicacy and
finesse, and enabled Mr. Westlake to
give one of his finest performances
ever. It is quite clear that, creating
and interpreting alike, we have the
artists right here; if only we will con-
tinue to give them work, they may stay
with us rather than seek success over-
seas and we will truly come of age
musically.

Painter and
playwright
Rodney Milgate (second from right) discusses the production of his first play, “A Refined Look at Existence”
RODNEY MILGATE’S talents are dis-
tinguished by an impressive diversity.
He is primarily a painter (winner of
the Fairfax Human Image Prize in
1964 and the Blake Prize in 1966),
but he also writes poetry and two
works in the Old Tote’s current season
of five Australian plays are his. “A
Refined Look at Existence,” which was
the hit of the 1966 Jane Street theatre
Australian play season, has been staged
again this season, and Milgate’s new
Milgate the painter at work in his studio -“I can get rid of a block in a play by doing some painting, or vice versa”


play, “At Least You Get Something
Out of That,” opens on April 30. Then
at the end of May, Milgate, his wife,
actress Dinah Shearing, and their two
sons leave for London and the United
States, where he will take up the Hark-
ness Fellowship he was awarded
earlier this year.
“We’re due in the States in Sep-
tember; before then we’ll spend some
time in London. I’ll see my agent,
whom I’ve never met, look at some
paintings, and perhaps do some writ-
ing. I have had a vague offer about
doing a film script.” Methuen is pub-
lishing “A Refined Look at Existence”
in. Britain this year, and is interested
in his second play, while Angus and
Robertson has just published his text-
book on art, “Art Composition A
Contemporary View.”
He is an art tutor in the faculty of
Architecture at Sydney University, and
is taking part in the current series of
televised tutorials on ATN7. “Teach-
ing is another area. It forces me to
get out of the house and the studio
and to talk to people. I don’t close
myself off to work ... I can get rid of
a block in a play by leaving off and
doing some painting, or vice versa. If
there’s any basic idea behind it all, it
is inter-relationship the feeling that
we’re all bound up with one another
and every action changes us in some
way, and affects other people. This is
implicit in my second play.”

BOOKS
Diary of a super-snob
By MALCOLM MUGGERIDGE
Chips: the Diaries of Sir Henry Chan-
non. Weidenfeld and Nicolson. $8.90.
IN ONE of his brighter flashes the late
Sir Henry Channon remarks, “Reform-
ers are always finally neglected, while
the memoirs of the frivolous will
always be eagerly read.”
How true! And how perfectly his
diaries exemplify the point! No re-
former he, they are frivolous indeed,
often scarcely above the level of a
well-informed column; grovellingly
sycophantic and snobbish as only a
well-heeled American nesting among
the English upper classes can be, with a
commonness that positively hurts at
times. And yet how sharp an eye!
What neat malice! How, in their own
fashion, well written and truthful and
honest they are! I have to admit with
the utmost regret, and even shame,
that if, in one of those desert-island
games, I had to choose between the
Channon and the Nicolson Diaries, it
would be Sir Henry every time for me
in preference to Sir Harold.
The appeal of the London social
and literary scene to displaced Ameri-
cans was probably at its greatest in the
twilight years of our final decline
James and Eliot both with memoirs to
come, Lady Cunard and other salon-
keepers of note, wives of the great like
Curzon and Randolph Churchill, and
begetters of the great like Hogg and
Macmillan, broadening down from
dollar-dowry to dollar-dowry, until
there looms up right at the end of
the line the most momentous of them
all Mrs. Ernest Simpson.
These returning pilgrim fathers and
mothers and sisters and aunts deserve
a special study; more particularly as
they have now largely disappeared,
probably for ever. Why, Monaco today
has more allure than Belgrave Square.
Will Harvard and Princeton any more
yield up their dead to Oxford and the
Athenaeum? Or any mute inglorious
Eliot tune his lyre beside the Thames
in preference to the Potomac or the
Hudson? In the light of our balance of
payments situation, I very much doubt
it.
Thus, in addition to the intrinsic
interest of his Diaries, Sir Henry has
the extra appeal of being the last of
a species. We shall never see his like
again so sure that in our sceptred
isle blood was blue and culture true
by contrast with the wilderness of
rough equality and philistinism across
the Atlantic; ready even to hold ster-
ling balances, Guinness-won, instead of
rushing to turn them into dollars; with
a dining-room that cost £6OOO, no less,
and worth it every time; the Kents
for neighbors, monocled Prince Paul
of Yugoslavia for chum, and the
final accolade becoming in due
course the Honorable Member for
Southend-on-Sea, one of our legislators,
for a while a figure at the Foreign
Office when Halifax reigned and R. A.
Butler was Under-Secretary and
appeasement was all the rage.
Sir Henry’s account of the Neville
Chamberlain era is really excellent.
Being and writing it all down
in a private journal which was only to
be published long afterwards, he could
afford to be frank as no other chronicler
has been. He feels himself under no
necessity to establish anti-appeasement
credentials; far from criticising Cham-
berlain’s supineness before Hitler and
Mussolini, he only wishes he had gone
on appeasing them. His attitude toward
Chamberlain is almost idolatrous; he
wants to kiss him, metaphorically, and
even actually surely an erotic in-
clination all his own. Toward Win-
ston Churchill, and still more Eden, he
takes up a position well this side of
idolatry, but Chamberlain has his whole-
hearted admiration and love.
There were many more inside and
outside Parliament who felt like this
than might now be supposed. I should
say that for a while Chamberlain was
the most popular Prime Minister of
modern times. Sir Henry states the
position with commendable frankness;
he just did not want a war while he was
still of an age to get involved in military
service. A war any war he was
shrewd enough to see, must in any case
wind up for ever the little set of smart
people into which he had managed to
insinuate himself with so much difficulty
and expense. It would mean, as Cyril
Connolly put it for him, closing time
in the pleasure gardens of the West.
When, despite Chamberlain’s best
efforts, the war came, he managed not
to get unduly involved, but otherwise
his worst fears’ were realised. “Was my
world collapsing?” he asked himself. It
surely was, and thenceforth there is a
twilight quality about the Diaries. We
hear vaguely of his divorce coming
•through; even the peerage he wanted,
and felt he had earned, eluded him.
It seems a shame after all his assidu-
ous cultivation of the great, his diligent
House of Commons service, the wooing
Chips (left) with Prince Furstenberg
and the winning of Southend-on-Sea, to
be deprived of what so many less deserv-
ing received. No Viscount Chips, no
Baron, not even Chips Bart; only Sir
Chips, a poor knight.
The truth is, of course, that Sir
Henry had an infallible knack of back-
ing the wrong horse. All those royalties
that he went after what could they
do for him except involve him in their
own decline? Chamberlain was an alba-
tross, and Rab no meteor to hitch a
wagon to, even though he throve politic-
ally in the post-war years. In the abdi-
cation crisis (and what a masterly
account Sir Henry provides of that!)
he put all his money on Mrs. Simpson
a great bet with enormous jackpot
possibilities, but alas, the filly was
scratched.
It is this Mr. Worldly Foolishman
quality which gives Sir Henry and the
Diaries their undoubted charm. If he
had really pulled it off, become Lord
Chips, fought them on the beaches, set
his sails to the wind of change, and
laughed at the Duke of Edinburgh’s
jokes, how intolerable he and the
Diaries would have been! There is some-
thing almost Boswellian in his occasional
moods of self-examination:
i Sometimes I think I have an unusual
character able but trivial; I have
flair, intuition, great good taste but only
second-rate ambition; I am far too sus-
ceptible to flattery; I hate and am un-
interested in all the things most men
like, such as sport, business, statistics,


debates, speeches, war, and weather;
but I am riveted by lust, furniture,
glamor, and society and jewels . . .
The able editor Mr. Robert Rhodes
James says that many of the Diaries’
indiscretions have had to be pruned in
deference to living persons. When this
caution becomes unnecessary I should
expect Sir Henry to be a ‘boon to his-
torians. What a relief to turn to him
after Sir Winston’s windy rhetoric, and
all those leaden narratives by field-
marshals, air-marshals, and admirals!
Groucho
By DENIS O'BRIEN
The Groucho Letters. (Letters From
and To Groucho Marx.) Michael
Joseph. $3.85.
HISTORICAL reference has as much
need of laughter as it has of disaster,
which is why we should all be thankful
that the United States Library of Con-
gress recently has acquired a large col-
lection of Groucho Marx’s correspond-
ence. No future scholar or student read-
ing the Marx papers could possibly
judge the twentieth century as being
all bad.
Groucho’s comic viewpoint has been
a source of rich laughter for more than
40 years and through it anyone can see
that we haven’t accepted the follies and
insanities of our time without derisive
question. Not that Groucho’s humor
makes any political or deep social
comment, or protests spitefully, or
cuts cruelly as so many younger comed-
ians do today. It is simply that the
most notable of the Marx brothers has,
by his leering wisecracks and telling
asides on the human condition, refused
to allow us to become interred in the
seriousness of it all.
Not even recognition by some of
the world’s most impressive men of
letters has shifted his feet from the
ground or the hat from his head. When
told that he had been made into a verb
(to Grouch) by James Joyce in “Fin-
negan’s Wake,” he reacted with typic-
ally amusing and deflating self-com-
posure: “There’s no reason why I
shouldn’t appear in ‘Finnegan’s Wake.’
I’m certainly as bewildered about life
as Joyce was.”
The idea for this book preceded the
request from Washington for his papers
and when the publishers first ap-
proached him he wired back: “Your
letter received and promptly burned.
I prefer not to have strangers prying
into my mail. Would discuss this in
detail but my secretary has a date in
five minutes with me.” His pub-
lishers and some of his many pen-pals
around the world prevailed and we
may now pry. The experience is bio-
graphically fascinating and therapeuti-
cally amusing.
In the selection of letters Groucho
has sent and received, the humorous
vein is most throbbingly apparent. Some
of the letters from the late Fred Allen,
for example, are so cleverly funny
(“There is a town,” wrote Allen from
a holiday resort, “so dull up here that
the tide went out one day and never
came back in”) that even Groucho
goes into admiring convulsions and
is stumped for a funnier retort. But
beyond the comedy beyond the wise-
cracks about income tax, bad plumbing,
political fools, social pretension, and
low-grade TV programs—Groucho is
revealed, fleetingly, as a compassionate
man, sincerely concerned about human
values, even if he does disguise his
feelings with a joke.
In 1954, when the Dean Martin-
Jerry Lewis partnership was beginning
to come apart, Groucho initiated a
correspondence with Lewis (“I hope the
rumors aren’t true, for you are awfully
good together and showbusiness needs
you”) which expressed a sympathetic
feeling uncommon among competitive
professionals in the U.S. entertainment
market.
On impulses born of admiration or
concern (or sometimes merely of comic
inspiration) Groucho has written dozens
of letters to complete strangers. Even
his most distinguished correspondents
have been disarmed by the flattery of
receiving a letter from Groucho. A
four-year exchange of letters with the
late T. S. Eliot began with them swop-
ping photographs, progressed to amus-
ing familiarity (“Dear Tom,” wrote
Marx, “If this isn’t your first name
I’m in a hell of a fix”), and was con-
tinuing to within a few months of
Eliot’s death, although their one meet-
ing wasn’t quite the amusing success
their letters had led them to anticipate.
Most of “The Groucho Letters” are
to and from his showbusiness associ-
ates and some of the earlier ones bite
with exasperated wit at the Hollywood
system when the Marx brothers were
making movies. Warner Brothers once
tried to stop the Marxes using the
title “A Night in Casablanca” be-
cause Warners earlier had made a pic-
ture called, simply, “Casablanca.”
Groucho’s reaction to such corporate
idiocy was expressed in letters of such
hilarious illogic that Warners’ legal
department eventually was stunned
into silence.
In mail to some of his closest
friends Groucho gives glimpses of the
concern he has felt at failure and the
apprehension for his professional to-
morrows. But he never strays far from
a wisecrack and is never funnier than
when writing irreverently to such gods
as TV sponsors.
After a successful TV season in 1951
his sponsor sent him a gold watch in
gratitude. Groucho was on one of the
peaks of his jaunty impertinence. He
replied: “The watch is a thing of
beauty and will be a joy for ever, and
I would have thanked you sooner, but
I purposely waited a week, for I
wanted to be sure that the lousy thing
would run.”
The sponsor kept the letter and
proudly lent it for this book. Fame is
being insulted by Groucho Marx.
Gertrude on Stein
By MARIA WOLKOWSKY
Look at me now and here I am.
Writings and Lectures, 1911-1945.
Gertrude Stein. Owen. $8.20.
GERTRUDE STEIN is probably one
of the most talked about and least read
of authors; “A rose is a rose is a rose”
one of the most used and abused and
least understood contributions to Eng-
lish literature. She has been called any-
thing from a genius to a nut, from the
goddess of prosody to a linguistic court-
jester. Her friends, in groping to eluci-
date her aims, have, in good faith, done
her as much damage as her enemies by
ridiculing her, in bad faith. This was
probably what she had in mind when
she once stated that she wrote only for
herself and for strangers . . . and on
second thoughts decided to omit the
strangers.
This book is one of the most valuable
contributions ever made to a better
understanding of Gertrude Stein’s work,
because she is allowed to explain herself,
and unlike some creative talents she
could still do this better than anyone
else. It begins by reprinting her own
lectures to literary societies in Oxford,
Cambridge, and several American
universities, in which she defined her
dissatisfaction with ordinary methods
of writing and the reasons for her
linguistic experiments. This is followed
up by a well-chosen selection from some
of her most important books, poetry,
and plays edited by Patricia Meyero-
witz and a brief biographical introduc-
tion by Elizabeth Sprigge.
My one objection is to the compilers*
inexplicable preference for a portrait
by Francis Rose instead of Picasso’s
masterpiece. The former’s stresses Miss
Stein’s masculine appearance, shows her
bosom-friend Alice B. Toklas busy
stitching in the background, her dog,
her desk, and her painting-collection;
in the front of the book it may repel
some doubtful readers; many otherwise
quite open-minded people are so put
out, even if subsconsciously, by such an
unconventional menage that they are
quite unable to read a sentence of hers
without prejudice.
Briefly, Gertrude Stein’s main life-
long concern was to cause words to have
more meaning again and to convey a
sense of immediacy which they had
been steadily losing. For her, the Eng-
lish language had been robbed of its
freshness through overuse, like too fre-
quently handled coins from which the
crisp imprint has been gradually
rubbed. She argued that from Chaucer
over the Elizabethans to Swift words
were still newly minted. After that,

their power to evoke and illuminate an
image had diminished. Chaucer could
say, “O moon,” and the moon was
there; Shakespeare could say, “A rose,”
and it conjured up a real flower; but
by the 20th century simple nouns had
become virtually meaningless, worn-out
shells.
“I’m no fool,” the author is quoted
as replying to a question about that
rose. “I know that in daily life we
don’t go round saying is a —is a—
is a . . . Yes, I’m no fool; but I think
that in that line the rose is red for
the first time in English poetry in
a hundred years.” In other words, all
those apparently bizarre and some-
times maddening constructions are
there to force the mind to re-create a
vivid picture.
As a postgraduate, Gertrude Stein
came under the influence of William
James’ psychological teachings and his
“stream of consciousness” principles
which helped to shape her whole method
of writing, including her use of the
“continuous present” tense. There
seems little doubt that her knowledge
of German and French also played
their own part in shaping her gram-
matical formulations in English. Born
in the United States of German-Jewish
ancestry, she was fortunate in having
led a highly civilised and very cos-
mopolitan existence from an early age
and her adult years were lived in
Paris.
Although she could not stand James
Joyce and fell out with her first pub-
lishers and mutual friends Eugene and
Maris Jolas because of this, looking
back today one cannot help seeing
that their final achievements have a
great deal in common. Miss Stein
seems to haVe forged a link, which
would otherwise have been missing,
between Joyce and the modern French
such as Nathalie Sarraute. Their
linguistic experiments meet even if
only from opposite poles Stein re-
jected Freud, the subconscious, and
all forms of mysticism, for example.
Inevitably, as she was a courageous
and prolific writer, there are some
exaggerations in her work which, while
in no way detracting from her im-
portance, can drive a reader to the
brink of dementia: “A little called
anything shows shudders. Come and
say what prints all day. A whole few
watermelon. There is no pope. No
cut in pennies and little dressing and
choose wide soles and little spats
really little spices. A little lace makes
boils. This is not true. Gracious of
gracious and a stamp a blue-green
white bow a blue-green lean, lean on
the top. If it is absurd then it is
leadish and nearly set in where there
is a tight head . . .” (From “Tender
Buttons.”)
Gertrude Stein’s famous last words
are so typical that one may be for-
given for suspecting that they had been
selected in advance and stored against
the moment for frequent quotation
for posterity: as she lay dying she
asked, “What is the answer?” When
there was no reply she laughed and
said, “Then what is the question?”
POETRY
Poetry is trying to stand a coin on
its rim
during an earthquake.
Poetry is trying to make a twenty-
cent piece stand
up on a bar counter when your hand
isn’t as steady
as it should be.
Poetry is beginning a doodle with a
dot in a circle
on the back of a receipt for a book
one can’t afford.
Poetry is to control a small area of
space.
Poetry is to admit that Space is be-
yond one’s control.
Poetry is doing something for nothing
expecting the greatest reward of all
which is nothing.
Poetry is what one does as well as
one can
when one can’t do anything else very
well.
Poetry is the bad taste of life
expressed in perfect good taste.
Poetry is burning
while Rome fiddles.

How an ounce of
Clarified Butter
brings out
a ton of flavour.
Clarified Butter (pure dairy butter with
the water, salt and curd removed)
brings out natural flavours in cooking
in a way no other cooking fats or oils
can. Because you use less Clarified
Butter than other fats (just enough to
cover the pan) food comes to the table
less greasy. The real flavour gets
through. And because you cook in
Clarified Butter at lower temperatures
than normal, foods don’t toughen up.

WITH GRAHAM KERR
Satisfying a
hunger
for attention
THURSDAY in Sydney. Thousands of
women, regardless of usual newspaper
affiliations, fall breathlessly on the
women’s sections and the social news.
Was their luncheon really necessary
did they rate a par or a pix was
that hat the right choice? It only
absorbs five minutes but in those
brief moments hopes are raised or
dashed that is, until next Thursday’s
editions.
No other main centre in Australia
has ever matched this curious side-
effect of taking luncheon. It all began
with Romano’s and Prince’s when
luncheons and afternoon teas were the
talk of the town. Exactly who decided
that the mass circulation readership
deserved to be told the color of Mrs.
Ponsonby-Smyth-Crosse’s hat, I don’t
know. Each week the respective man-
agements compiled their doubles charts.
Forty-seven mentions for Prince’s, 48
for Romano’s.
One public-relations representative
breathed a sigh of relief and fell on
the “social” lists with the enthusiasm of
an Olympic athlete. This priceless
lady moved to join Mr. Johnny
Walker’s Bistro. It obviously paid off,
even though “genial Johnny” now tells
me that they no longer retain such
consultants.
Over the past few weeks my doubles
chart indicates a clear leadership for
The Bistro. Here are the figures: Bistro
19, Weinkeller 13, Summit Restaurant
10, Ye Olde Crusty Tavern 9, French
Tavern 8. Although there are frequent
mentions of ladies who live in Bellevue
Hill, Vaucluse, and Double Bay, this
doesn’t mean that the “establishment”
is sought after by the Press. All the
social editors told me that “if a woman
pays for her newspaper, then she
has equal rights to be mentioned.”
It is just that the general price of
eating is a little beyond the “average
secretary or shop assistant.” I admit
that it crossed my mind to ask why
they didn’t exercise this democratic
desire and visit Fred’s Coffee Bar in
York Street and witness the consump-
tion of a corned-Beef-and-tomato-sand-
wich by Miss Liza Smethers, who was
discussing with her friends her forth-
coming trip to Palm Beach.
Consumed with interest in this whole
affair I sent my wife, Treena, with a
friend to lunch at The Bistro. She was
duly visited.
“What are you celebrating?” asked
the reporter in a bored voice.
“Our wedding anniversary,” she re-
plied.
“Sorry, we aren’t covering anniver-
saries today,” said the girl.
It’s true, in the past six weeks anni-
versaries have been OUT. But to guide
you, here are the IN reasons. Pro-
jected trips rate high with 19 men-
tions. Wedding plans do well with 8.
Engagements rate a simple 3. Weddings
only total 1.
On the other hand you stand a fair
chance with 21st birthdays, reunions, or
celebrating the purchase of a country
home (not house).
The system is very well oiled. The
social “roundswoman” hits the first of
the famous five at about noon on
Wednesday. Accompanied by a photog-
rapher, she inquires of the manage-
ment if anything spectacular is hap-
pening. As it happens the poor
man, or his receptionists, have been
burdened with every imaginable pub-
licity reason for a large percentage of
their guests being “coverable.”
“Well, helloooo, Johnny how are
you. Just popped in to celebrate Aunt
Jemima’s return from Lithuania . . .
Where is she? . . . Well, she’s a little
tired at present, but isn’t it just too
fascinating?”
Or even quite blatantly . . .
“Have the Press been yet? . . . they
have . . . where have they gone next?”
Each of the famous five is in-
undated with bookings, making Wed-
nesday a high-profit day, but there is
a trend in evidence.
The swing is away from hats, white
gloves, and middle age. The papers
are now after the young, attractive,
long-haired, mini-skirted set.
I am advised that a mention or,
better still, a photograph is great ad-
vertising. Invitations to parties increase
tenfold and, many times, the result is
wedding bells with a luncheon at
one of the “famous five” to celebrate
the affair, of course.
I’m not so impressed by the hard-
core “professionals” who trade on the
mentions, but then, in this case, I am
not alone. To a woman, the social
editors are extremely caustic about
“the lady on the climb.” Any sugges-
tion that Mrs. Such ’n’ Such is over-
eager and down comes the axe.
One last section appeals neither to
my sense of sorrow nor anger. In a
way I believe that I approve. These
are the “droppcrs-in.” A group of
ladies who tour the “five” on Wed-
nesdays, having a glass of wine here, an
olive there, but for some reason never
getting around to ordering a meal.
They have ample evidence to support
anniversaries, overseas trips, new
homes, “tourist” friends, even wonder-
ful hats. Their objective is simple to
make both papers on the same day
the Gold Medal in Sydney’s Luncheon
Olympics.

Eye-opener
Apparently, as Sandra Hall seems to be
saying in “Eyes and options open” (8.,
April 27) British emigrants to Aus-
tralia are mainly “coming in out of
the cold.” But as this is not true of
many newcomers from Mediterranean
countries, who may finally outnumber
Britishers in Australia, nor true of
Asians who may come here, isn’t it
possible that such articles give only a
partial view of Australia as its
immigrants see it? This might be worth
thinking about if, as I assume, such
articles are intended to illuminate Aus-
tralia for Australians. An essay on what
first- and second-generation Greeks,
Italians, Chinese, etc., think about Aus-
tralia could be more instructive.

Doing more
Under the title “Doing more if the
Americans do less,” Observer in his
comment (8., April 20), gives a
pertinent extract from Richard Nixon’s
“Asia After Vietnam” published in
The Bulletin of October 14 last year.
There are several ways in which Aus-
tralia might do more. But if American
foreign policy follows the trend sug-
gested by Mr. Nixon the U.S.A. is
likely to return to first principles and
heed the dictum of Francis Bacon that
he who commands the sea can have as
much or as little of war as he pleases.
On the assumption that “after Viet-
nam” the U.S. contribution to the S.-W.
Pacific is likely to be restricted to its
7th Fleet with a strong contingent of
U.S. Marines, there is one way in which
Australia could play a useful part and
also cement her alliance. Australia
should take full advantage of being
an island and expand her navy. This
expansion should include an amphibious
force carrying troops who, whatever
their nomenclature, would have the
qualities and equipment of the U.S.
Marine Corps.

Explaining Greece
It is easy, as you said (8., April 13),
to find fault with a translation in a
foreign language of a Greek text, such
as the book “Why the Revolution of
April 21, 1967, Took Place.” It is also
a matter for regret that the message
of the book in question seems to have
passed unnoticed in The Bulletin. Yet
this message was in figures and not
in translated words, namely that the
Communist uprising of 1944-1948 cost
Greece among others 45,214 in dead,
36,909 in wounded, and 28,000 chil-
dren, the flower of the Greek youth,
spirited away from the country and
their parents. Isn’t this experience
enough to explain the Greek people’s
reticence at present to allow a repeti-
tion of this recent past, even at the
cost of having to forgo temporarily
their well-cherished, but unfortunately
often misused, political freedom?

Backing away...
I wish to make two comments on
D. P. Sheahan’s “Backing away . .
(8., April 13) letter. The first con-
cerns our nationhood, and the second
our eating habits. He begins with the
assumption that Australia has been a
nation for the past 70 years. And as a
nation we were allied with Britain
. . in two major conflicts and several
lesser ones.” We fought World War I
not as a nation but as a province
of an empire, a country that did not
dhtirely control its own foreign affairs
and defence. Only recently have we
(if at all) attained the status of nation-
hood. We are a country that has not got
its own national anthem. One that
theoretically has both its Head of State
and the Head of Government chosen
by a lady resident in England. We are
still a country that has to have all
legislation okayed by a foreigner. Con-
stitutionally it is the Queen, and not us,
who has the final word. These
encroachments on our sovereignty, and
a lack of symbols signifying nationhood
point to the conclusion that Australia is,
as yet, not a nation. Therefore we have
never been Britain’s ally “as a nation.”
Colony, province, semi-autonomy, but
never as a nation.
My second comment is a favorable
one. I wish to give the British their
due in that this great race condescended
to civilise our eating habits. We must
also thank them for shaping the wild
colonials’ speech from the barbaric to
the refined. These acts of charity
become decisive when considering
loyalty to Britain. Finally, I person-
ally have no passionate desire to be
regarded as both British and Aussie. I
have no divided loyalties, I am proud
to be an Australian. I don’t profess to
be anything else. I don’t strive for
recognition as being comparable, or as
being one of the superior. In the same
sense I don’t lay claim to being the
direct descendant of the Omnipotent.

-makes the choice worthwhile
Mildara Supreme Sherry is an outstanding example of the art of
the winemaker. A great sherry in the Mildara tradition of quality.
Here is a true, pale, delicate dry Sherry of Fino style. Mildara
Supreme Dry has been called the “Man’s sherry.” No other sherry
can quite match its smooth, subtlety, its distinctive taste and
bouquet. In one word— Supreme.
Mildara Chestnut Teal is a Sherry in the true Oloroso style, dark
golden in colour with a luscious mellow style of sweetness usually
preferred by women. This Sherry is an ideal appetiser for those who
prefer a sweeter style of wine.
