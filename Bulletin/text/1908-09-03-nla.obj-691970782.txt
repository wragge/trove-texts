The RED PAGE
Her
ORIGINALLY she was clubbed and
yanked off to a damp cave by an
energetic male, and on reviving
found herself married to the man with
the waddy. Then—thqugh possibly it
took time and effort—she loved him.
Since those strenuous days she has some-
what bettered her position ; and nowa-
days the clubbing is by compliments;
and she revenges herself for that old-
time slight by cooking for him. It
is of this struggle for a status that
James Donaldson, Principal of the Uni-
versity of St. Andrews, historically
treats in his Woman: Her Position
and Influence in Ancient Greece and
Pome, and among the Parly Christians.
(Longmans, Green, per Sydney Book
Club.)
W
In Ancient Greece and Rome she
had, on the whole, the time of her life.
If, for instance, like Phryne, she was
brought before the Court, all that George
Reid Hyperides, who was defending her,
had to do was to tear open the garment
of his client, and “ reveal to the judges a
bosom perfectly marvellous in form.”
She was at once acquitted, though
Donaldson carefully points out that the
judges were not actuated by any prurient
motive. According to an ancient writer :
The judges beheld in such an exquisite
form not an ordinary mortal, but a priestess
and prophetess of the divine Aphrodite.
They were inspired with awe, and would
have deemed it a sacrilege to mar or destroy
such a perfect masterpiece of creative power.
It is probably an ancestral memory of
this celebrated acquittal that prompts
the modern respondent in the divorce
court to wear her biggest hat and her
draughtiest apparel.
\V
In Homeric times she had a life that
was at least full of excitement. In the
deepest boredom of matrimony, induced
by the depressing sight of the same hus-
band at breakfast every morning, she was
always comforted by the knowledge that
at any moment a rude stranger might
slay her husband and carry her off.
However, there were drawbacks. In the
Homeric poems there is no love-making ;
the idea of flirtation is absolutely and
entirely unknown. Since then, however,
woman has studied the art. And in
Homer there was a large amount of
common-sense. If a husband died it was
incumbent upon the widow to marry
again. This habit has survived.
And when a husband is long absent from
his wife, it is not expected that he can en-
dure the troubles of life without the company
and comfort of one woman’s society.
This peculiar custom is, happily, un-
known amongst us modems.
•■ ' j
The ideal Greek woman had to
be healthy, well-proportioned, and tall
—also forty. In Sparta the girls
had to engage in wrestling, racing,
and throwing the javelin —-like the
male athletes, stripping for the con-
test before the assembled multitude. In
this way the whole body of citizens
would come to know a girl’s powers ; no
sickly girl could pass herself off as
healthy. And every Spartan girl had to
marry—unless she were sickly. For
the State insisted upon healthy offspring,
and usually got it by the simple process
of examining every child shortly after
birth and killing it if it did not reach
the standard of probable healthiness set
by the board of examiners. As a neces-
sary corollary, all the men had to marry,
and they were punished if they married a
woman disproportionately young or old.
The results of such a system were that:
For about four or five hundred years
there was a succession of the strongest race
of men that possibly ever existed on the face
of the earth.
The men were brave, the women re-
markable for vigor of body and beauty
of form. But evils crept in ; the women,
having no purpose in life except mother-
hood, grew luxurious. Sparta vanished.
In Athens the wife had no part in
public life. She had merely to stay at
home. She was not supposed to have
brains. Her highest praise was not to
have been talked about by men. No
citizen-woman, during the great days of
Athens, ever achieved the slightest dis-
tinction in art, literature, or science.
But the stranger-woman was prohibited
from marrying a citizen. Accordingly,
the married man selected the stranger to
be his companion, his Hetaira ; and the
Hetaira became the only educated woman
in Athens. And each of .the great men
in Athens had his Hetaira, the most
famous of all being Aspasia, the “ com-
panion ” of Pericles ; and to her house
resorted all the great men of Athens.
Socrates, the person who asked a great
number of rude questions, Phidias, an
earlier Rodin, and Euripides, the Bernard
Shaw of those times, were in constant
attendance. 4
Turning to anciqnt Rome, we find
divorce almost as easy as in modern
America. Marriage existed only so long
as both parties were willing; the sole
obstacles to a dissolution of marriage were
the necessity of carrying it out in a
strictly legal manner, and the duty of
consulting near relatives. No sacredness
invested the idea of marriage ; no shame
therefore attached to its dissolution. It
was a contract, an agreement between two
parties, and whenever this agreement
began to gall the one or the other, there
was no reason why the parties should not
cry off their bargain. One good aspect
of this point of view was that it pre-
cluded breach of promise actions. And
every Roman citizen girl got a man.
This delectable arrangement was made
possible by the fact that the Roman
father had the right of exposing his
children, and as he had to provide
dowries for his daughters, he judiciously
thinned out the female babies. Thus
there were not enough spinsters to go
round. The demand exceeded the supply.
The recalcitrant bachelor was heavily
fined, and the parents of a large family
received special honors and privileges.
Mr. Deakin might consider the advisa-
bility of such a Lex Papia Poppsea for
Australia.
W
But the rights that woman had gradu-
ally won for herself—rights as great as
those she possesses now—were suddenly
snatched from her. A new leligion came
into fashion—a religion that regarded
woman as an evil. It was Christianity
that flung woman back again to the
humiliating position she had occupied in
prehistoric times. The Early Christians
knocked the woman movement upon the
head with the waddy of celibacy.
The prevalent opinion that Chris-
tianity stepped in at a period when
Roman society was utterly corrupt is not
borne out by history. As Donaldson
remarks :
There is no picture of the last days of the
Republic or the first years of the Empire
that is so black as that painted by Ammianus
Marcellinus of his own times. And the
licentiousness of Pagan Rome is nothing to
the licentiousness of Christian Africa, Rome
and Gaul, if we can put any reliance on the
description of Salvian.
Instead of encouraging by every means
the propagation of the race, the Early
Christians regarded a large family as a
disgrace, a proof of lasciviousness. The
position of women in the first three cen-
turies of the Christian era was lowered
and degraded as a consequence of the
priestly deprecation of marriage.
At the time when Christianity dawned on
the world women had attained great free-
dom, power, and influence in the Roman
Empire. They enjoyed freedom of inter-
course in society, they walked and drove, in
the public thoroughfares with veils that did
not conceal their faces, they dined in the
company of men, they studied literature and
philosophy, they took part in political move-
ments, they were allowed to defend their
own law cases, and they helped their hus-
bands in the government of provinces and
the writing of books.
vf>
Prom this enviable position of pride
and freedom the Surly Christians de-
graded them, and henceforth women were
to be seen only in two capacities —as
martyrs and deaconesses. (Nowadays no
woman is a deaconess, and all women are
martyrs.) By these Surly Christians she
was allowed to go out only to church, 01
when accompanying her husband to visit
a sick brother. As she was not allowed to
go shopping, it seems incomprehensible
how any woman ever became an Eaily
Christian. Marriage, even for the sake
of children, was a carnal indulgence.
Better not marry at all. Woman was
graded in this order of merit: virgins,
widows and wives. Wives were weak
and unfortunate beings who had “fallen
into wedlock ; and the only thing for
such degraded beings was to stay at home
and mind the children.
Thanks to this handicap of Christi-
anity, it has taken woman nearly two
thousand years to regain her lost position
of personal freedom and personal re-
sponsibility. The present writer, how-
ever, knows three suburban husbands
who have decided to become Early
Christians.
The Ring, the TroussOau, and the
House of My Own
Among the books like How to be Happy
though Married, How to be Blithe though
Bilious, and How to be Genial though
Buried, such a book as Modern Marriage and
How to Bear It, by Maud Churton Braby
(Laurie, per Gf. Bobertson) conies as a cheer-
ful relief. Despite its title, it happens to
be written by a rather sane woman, and her
philosophy of marriage, though lightly ex-
pressed, is sound.
That marriage needs amendment is ad-
mitted by many of the great writers. Tol-
stoy says : “ The relations between the sexes
are searching for a new form, the old one is
falling to pieces ” ; Ibsen remarks that
“marriage, the relation between man and
wife, has corrupted the race and impressed
the mark of slavery upon all ” ; while Mere-
dith’s pronouncement in favor of leasehold
marriage is sufficiently recent and famous
not to need quotation. Maud Braby con-
siders the possible alternatives. As to the
terminable leasehold marriage, it is practically
in operation in the United States. In 1903,
over half-a-million marriages were dissolved
by the divorce courts, which means that one
marriage out of every four ends in divorce,
and the most frequent cause for the smash-
up is a mere desire for change.
As for frhe-love, Maud Braby points out
that it has never been openly successful,
and that a relationship which affects the
future generation can never be a private and
personal matter. Polygamy was practised
by the Hebrews from the time of Lainech,
“ evidently with the approval of the Deity.”
There are good and bad points in polygamy.
“How it would solve the superfluous woman
question,” ejaculates one of the characters in
this book. ‘‘ Think of the enormous number
of miserable spinsters who would be happily
provided for ! ”
“ Think of the expense 1 ”
And polygamy was promptly ruled out by
the men. But the Blue Stocking rather
liked the idea.
“ If it were all fair and above-board, if it
were grasped that polygamy is more suited
to men’s nature, and more likely to make for
the happiness of the greatest number of
women—their numerical strength being so
far in advance of men that they couldn’t
possibly expect to have a mate each—-then I
really think, after women had had time to
readjust their ideas, they would accept it
gladly, and find peace and contentment in
it.” The Blue Stocking explains that there
need be no harem. Each wife would, live
separately. “I am thinking now of the
thousands of women leading miserable, dull,
and lonely lives, who would be infinitely
happier if they had a certain week to look
forward to, at regular recurring intervals,
when their husbands would be living with
them.”
Legalised polyandry is ruled out owing to
the fact that there are at present a surplus
of women, so that each could not possibly
have two husbands. “ Duogamy ” —two
partners apiece—is also suggested, the idea
being that what a husband or wife could not
fin'd in his or her No. 1, each might find in a
No. 2. But the servant difficulty would
upset that delightful scheme. And all these
avenues to reform end in the same cul-de-sac
—children. The author has, however, a
good word for the “ preliminary canter a
I marriage for three years, which could then
be dissolved by the wish of either, or made
permanent. But each partner could have
only one trial; the second marriage would
be a permanent one. But here again the
road leads to the insuperable barrier of the
disposal and maintenance of the children,
v*/
Here are a couple of the author’s common-
sense pronouncements :
“ Since people resist temptation far less
often than moralists suppose, it is perhaps
safe to state that when men are faithful, it
is principally from lack of opportunity, or
disinclination to do otherwise. This may
disgust those of my feminine readers who
refuse, to acknowledge, with Prof. Lester
Ward, that man is essentially a polygamous
animal, but the more experienced in the
sorrowful facts of life will own the truth of
this statement. . . .
“ Lapses from the marriage vow on the
part of one’s spouse are best treated in a
philosophical spirit. One often hears that
sexual jealousy is the most frightful of
mental tortures. Men are more keenly
affected by it than women, and the man
whose wife has been unfaithful seems to
suffer more acutely, even when he does not
care for her, than the woman in the reverse
circumstances. Probably the real reason is
that man has generally had his own way
I since the menage in Eden, and he resents
having his belongings taken from him.
Woman, however, can bear this deprivation
better, being more accustomed to share her
lord from the time when her sex began to
multiply in excess of his—or is it that women
have no instinctive antagonism to polygamy ?
In novels, the discovery of a husband’s in-
fidelity causes a perfect cataclysm ; the wife
almost loses her reason ; her friends and
relatives sit in gloomy council deciding ‘ what
is to be done ’; the news is shouted from the
housetops ; and everybody cuts the husband
dead. But in real life women keep these
tragedies to themselves, sometimes bearing
them with a strange calmness and phi-
losophy.”
Francis R. C. Hopkins is not even let off
with a caution. His Birds of Passage, a col-
lection of Australian short stories, published
by Deaton and Spencer, Douglas-street,
Sydney, is a quite commonplace volume,
composed of the sort of rambling narrative
short story that died twenty years ago.
This is quoted merely as a dreadful ex-
ample of how not to begin a short story :
‘ ‘ I knew a good old clergyman once, whose
stories of the early days were of the highest
possible interest. . . . One of his tales nar-
rated at a wedding breakfast —where I was
the principal person concerned—has long
dwelt in my memory, for it possesses
many features outside the general range of
everyday incident. ...” Here Hopkins has
made a number of irrelevant statements, and
has bold one lie—for the story that follows—
when you get to it—is of the tritest kind.
Oscar Wilde’s delightful essay, The Soul of
Man—a, perfectly worded and witty plea for
Socialism —can now be got in separate book
form, admirably printed (Arthur Humphreys,
London). “ The chief advantage that would
result from the establishment of Socialism,”
says. Wilde, ‘ ‘ is, undoubtedly, the fact that
Socialism would relieve us from that sordid
necessity of living for others which, in the
present condition of things, presses so hardly
upon almost everybody.” He finds that
under Socialism, and only under Socialism,
Individualism would have free play for the
perfection of its instincts.
A cheap series that promises to be of value
is The World’s Story Tellers, published by
Jack (London). The first volume contains
three stories by Gautier, the admirable
translation being by the late Lafcadio
Hearn.
In the latest number of that excellent
artistic magazine, Art and Architecture (W.
Brooks, Sydney, 15.)., the chief articles are
appreciations of Francis McOomas and E.
Phillips Fox, adequately illustrated.

A GREAT SUFFERER
Tried Many Medicines.
“ There is no question of greater importance to a
community than health,” said Mr. George Alfred
Willis, of No. 7 Bourke Street, Zetland, when re-
cently engaged in conversation with a reporter,
“ for when that is lost matters remain at a stand-
still pending its recovery. That was my experi-
ence, at all events,” he continued, “for when I
was taken ill some time back, I was not able to
get along at all.”
“Was your work of a laborious nature, Mr.
Willis?”
“ Carpentering—not the easiest job on earth,
you know ; but if it had been quill driving it would
have been all the same to me, as I had no energy
whatever. As a matter of fact, I was confined
to my bed, and things looked very blue, for I was
getting no assistance from the physic I was taking,
and it seemed to me that I was a done man. I
had read of Clements Tonic, and asked if I would
give myself a last chance with that remedy. A
relative who had used it said ‘ yes,’ very emphati-
cally, and gave me her reasons.”
“You were in such straits that you were willing
to accept almost any ad vice, I suppose ? ”
“Well, you see, there was scarcely anything
left for me to take, and as all other remedies had
proved futile, what was the good of going back to
them ? So I soon got some Clements Tonic, and
what a God-send it was, too. I was just about as
low as I could be, not having been outside the
house for a fortnight, and if it hadn’t been that
Clements Tonic was taken just in the nick of time
my ailments may have taken such a hold on my
system as to have defied all efforts at eradication. I
think it was pleurisy that had seized me, and, oh !
what a terrible cough I had—so painful and so
exhausting, that each bout aggravated my feeble-
ness. A great deal of phlegm came away, and one
would almost think I had consumption, to judge
by the pallor of my cheeks and the shrunken
state of my body. The pains in my lungs were
very acute, making me dread the necessity of
drawing my breath, as each time I did, a sensation
like a knife cutting made me writhe in agony. It
was not a life I cared to cling to, believe me,
for one would be far better off dead, and out of the
world altogether, than linger in such misery.”
“ What kind of nourishment were you in the
habit of taking?”
“ I was existing on cereal foods, and even that
there was a difficulty in digesting. Always head-
aches in the mornings, a nasty fur roofing my
mouth, which made me continue washing it during
the night, the dryness, too, being troublesome ;
and at least two mornings in the week I would
find myself vomiting. I was pitifully nervous and
shaky, and my mind was not at ease, either day
or night. I could not help thinking that some
great trouble was hanging over my head, threat-
ening, like the sword of Damocles, to descend
with destruction at any moment, and to tell you
the plain truth, my life was a burden to me.”
“Were you long using Clements Tonic before
you felt any benefit ? ”
“Some little time passed before I noticed
an improvement, but then you must remem-
ber the circumstances—how thoroughly broken
down I was, and I think the marvel is
that I pulled round so well. But Clements
Tonic kept building me up, and restoring
my internal organs to a healthy state, until I was
as sound as possible. What a remarkable thing
Clements Tonic is to make a person eat —why,
even on the hottest days it gave me a good
appetite, and such a splendid remedy for nervous-
ness and insomnia, too. For years I had suffered
from giddiness in a bad form. If I stooped to lace
my boots or anything, when I rose up I’d seem to
go round like a top, and even when out walking
I’d give a sudden reel occasionally, like a man who
had been indulging in something stronger than
lemonade.”
“ Do you get those sensations now ? ”
“No; they have quite left me, thanks to
Clements Tonic, and I have nothing to thank but
that medicine for ridding me of my cough, and
ultimately restoring me to the very soundest
health. So now you can publish these facts
broadcast.”
STATUTORY DECLARATION.
I, GEORGE ALFRED WILLIS, of 7 Bourke Street, Zet-
land, in the State of New South Wales, Commonwealth of
Australia, do solemnly and sincerely declare that I have

and is a true and faithful account of my illness and cure
by Clements Tonic, and also contains my full permission

to be true, and by virtue of the provisions of the Oaths

Above is the Proof in the Facts.
Here is Proof in the Reason Why:
This success illustrates the enormous
advantage which constantly accrues to
SCOTT’S Emulsion by reason of its
perfect digestibility. This digestibility
is achieved by the SCOTT process,
which also does away with the nauseous
taste and smell of the plain oil. Add
to this the superb quality of all the
ingredients used in SCOTT’S and it
is easy to see why SCOTT’S Emulsion
possesses a record for checking con-
sumption which is possessed by no
other cod liver oil emulsion whatsoever.
Therefore, when purchasing, don’t ask
for “ Emulsion; ” ask for and get

VARIOUS VERSE
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
In Attic-Land —Penelope.
The red-haired girl at “ fifty-nine”
Is an unconscious heroine.
Her soul sublimes the dingy room ;
Her attic-window faces mine.
She is not beautiful nor wise,
But dwells above the plane of lies,
Where thoughts of sweet potential bliss
Have glorified her wistful eyes.
From dawn to dusk she sits and sews
Her martyred soul in dainty clothes ;
The butterflies that flaunt her skill
Are merely night-moths no one knows.
Although it seems her destiny
To broider skirts for Paganry,
Her dress is always plain and neat,
The greatness of simplicity.
She is too sweet to need a name ;
A soul set in a window-frame,
Her consciousness of strength and pride
Abashes me with certain shame.
By day our glances seldom meet,
But when the stars with dazzling feet
Pursue the stealthy dark, we smile
Incipient thoughts across the street,
And watch the clouds and shooting stars,
And chimney-stacks that jostle Mars,
Our souls too full of dream to heed
The fussing of impatient cars.
Her mouth is redder than the rose,
Yet never kiss of lover knows;
She dreams of gods and love o’ nights,
By day she fashions harlots’ clothes.
Soon Love will call at “ fifty-nine’’
On an unconscious heroine.
I know her better than she thinks;
Her attic looks across to mine.

Twilight.
The silent hour when the spirits laid
To rest by day in oblivion deep
In gorge, by river, ’neath sylvan shade
WherP the noonday cometh to swoon and slee]
The silent hour when the spirits glide
From haunts of slumber with noiseless feet
Across the woe of the whimpering tide
To pass like whispers through lane and street.
Thus Twilight comes to Dunedin town,
Silken and soft in her garments grey.
Throned and mighty the heights look down
At their reflex deep in each quiet bay.
Mist wraiths rise from their weed-strewn bed
And hushed, steal in from the sea rim wide
To weave white shrouds where a day lies dead
On the knees of the pitying Eventide.
With voe and headland reflected clear,
The harbor sleeps in its hill-girt nest.
In rosy splendor the cloud fleets steer
To the red portflares in the blazing West.
The blue fades fast, and the Heaven above
Transfigured shines with a hallowed light
As the lamps of Promise, and Peace, and Love
Are lit in the dome of the Infinite.
The sombre skylines are ridged with gold,
The hills go out and are seen no more,
And I hear the tale by the sand dunes told
To the sad sea-harpers along the shore.
On Ocean’s bosom in passion sinks
The fevered sun in his sullen shame,
And tarrying Night of the dayspring drinks
With her cold dark forehead lit up with flame.
The Day’s last arrows are shot and spent.
The morn’s bright visions their faces hide,
And Nature lies like a bow unbent
Some wearied archer has laid aside.
So Twilight passes to realms of sleep;
The myriad eyes of the stars look down.
Below—the darkness that rides the deep,
And the flickering lights of Dunedin town.
MAORILAND.
FRANK HUDSON.
To a Jackie.
You’re White, of course—or a kind of White;
But you’re streaked a bit, and it don’t look right.
And it comes as a shock, after all the fuss.
That you don’t look White, and you don’t look Us.
And though, of course, it’s your affair,
You don’t seem anxious to cut your hair.
And your head seems to bulge behind a bit,
And your cap and your clothes don’t seem to fit.
And we can’t enthuse much over your knack
Of lacing your corsets behind your back.
And your officers—well, we find it hard
When we see them dressed like a tramway guard.
And their names, when printed, read too much
Like German and Pole and Dago-Dutch.
Of course yon slate beyond your share ;
But a White Australian can beat you there.
But we wonder what sort of a White we’ve struck,
When we find, sometimes, you’re a big, black buck!
And you look so foreign, it’s rather queer
That you speak our talk—or something near.
We can make you out though we find your tone
Like a banjo poured through a gramaphone.
But where in your ships have you hidden him
Of the noble brow and the length of limb,
And the heavy shoulders and face of tan—
Oh, where is the Dana Gibson Man l
‘‘ Epluribus Unum ! ” Your motto’s all right.
“ Out of Many, a Mongrel 1 ” don’t seem polite ;
But if you’re a mongrel, you’ll understand
You’re a Very White mongrel—so here’s our hand.
“ Here’s how ! ” in a gladsome, friendly way.
From the All White men to the Whitey Grey.

THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 3,190 S.
A CAPITAL THAT IS “ACCEPTABLE TO
NEW SOUTH WALES.”
Mr. Parkks asked the Premier in the Legislative Assem-
bly last evening whether, at the inauguration of Federa-
tion, there was an understanding that the Federal seat of
government should be centred in Melbourne not longer
than seven years. The Premier repjied that he knew of
no such understanding. Questioned whether he proposed
to take any early steps to approach the Federal
authorities with a view to the seat of government being
transferred to Sydney pending the selection of a site for
the capital, the Premier said : “The Prime Minister has
stated that the subject will he one of the first to be taken
in hand when the Federal session takes place next month,
and I am hopeful that at a very early date a site will have
been selected acceptable to New South Wales and the
Federation. For the present, therefore, it would not be
desirable to take any further action that might compli-
cate the situation.”
Sydney Telegraph, some little time ago.
The Australian Parliament meets in a few days,
and one of the first items on the bill-of-fare is that
aged dry bone of contention, the Australian capi-
tal. A very tired old bone it is these times, and
the sooner it is out of the way the better. The
question to be decided is whether Australia is to
have the best capital it can get under the restricted
circumstances, or whether any wretched old spot
is good enough ; whether the selection is to be
directed solely by consideration for what is
best tor the Commonwealth, or whether it is to
be guided by consideration for a wholly
imaginary sentiment in N.S.W. ; also whether
the interests of this continent, which, we hope,
will last while the world endures, are to come first,
or whether the great essential is to be the petty
local prejudices of State Premier Gregory Wade,
who will be dead in a few years, and a mere hand-
ful of dust in a few more. In this matter the
interests of the whole community have already
been once set aside. The question at issue to-day
is not the choice of the best site in Australia for
the Australian capital, but of the best site in
N.S'.W. for the Australian capital. Nearly nine-
tenths of the Commonwealth are already barred
from selection, no matter how advantageous cer-
tain sites in that area may be. And when the
selection of a site was limited to N.S.W.
there was not even a decent pretence made
that the limitation was done in the in-
terests of Australia. All the talk was of
“ the claims of N.S.W.” and the rights or interests
of the continent and the nation were not once
mentioned. Some day, it may be, there will be
written and published throughout the Empire the
whole story of the despicable trickery by which
the limitation of the capital to N.S.W. was
brought about—the agreement with the other
States that there must be 50,000 affirmative
votes at the N.S.W. Federal referendum; the
entrance of the other States into the Federal
movement on that agreement; the N.S.W.
Parliament’s dirty-minded breach of faith
whereby the minimum was raised to 80,000 ; the
nullification of the popular acceptance of the first
Constitution, in which the capital question was
left solely to the decision of the Australian Parlia-
ment; the demand by a huckstering N.S.W.
Ministry for possession of the capital as
the only price at which it would go on
witli its own Federal movement; and all
the rest. If that story of treachery and
paltry meanness is ever written in full and circu-
lated over the Empire, the N.S.W. State Legisla-
tive that did the thing, and the crowd outside the
Legislature which helped in the doing of it, will
be spat upon by every fair-minded citizen in
Edward Vll.’s wide dominions.
And now that the area of choice is confined to
the limits of N.S.W., there is again, in the camp
which represents the political descendants of the
men who did the despicable fraud of ten years ago
or thereabouts, a complete absence of any allusion
to the interests of Australia. Again, there is
nothing to be heard save the old cry about “ the
claims of N.S.W.” An elaborate and ridiculous
lie has been devised to the effect that the people
of N.S.W. are bitterly opposed to the site
which the Australian Parliament has selected.
True, there is not a shred of evidence to
show that they object—there are no meetings,
no petitions, no processions, no riot or revolution,
no clamor at the door of Parliament, no exacting
of pledges at the State elections that the candi-
date will perish in the last ditch before he con-
sents to Dalgety being the political centre of the
Commonwealth, no enthusiastic return of anti-
Dalgety candidates to represent N.S.W. in the
Australian Parliament (in fact, it was entirely
the anti-Dalgety members who lost their seats on
last Federal polling day). And the papers which
assure the quiescent people of N.S.W. that they
are raving mad at the proposed capital are the same
papers which told them at different times in the
past that they were strongly anti-Federal, that
they were strongly anti-Protectionist, that they
were wholly anti-Sosh, that they were infuriated
at the proposed “conscription,” that they were
“ruined” by Federal legislation, and all the
other bowled-out fabrications of Toryism—
therefore the evidence of these papers is
just as much discredited as that of the
old-time false witness who wore straw in his
shoes as a sign that he would swear to anything
for a fair consideration. It is a clumsy, self-
evident lie, this tale about the alleged dissatisfac-
tion of the people of N.S. W. with the Federal
proposals. Eyen ex-Premier Carruthkrs, the
strongest supporter of the weary fiction, didn’t dare
to carry out his declared intention of taking a
referendum of his own State in order that the
alleged seething dissatisfaction might have a
chance to boil over in public and declare itself.
Apparently he knew that the seething dissatisfac-
tion was a wretched fiction of his own devising.
* * * »
The tale which Wade and his friends tell to
the people of N.S.W. is practically that they (the
said Cornstalk people) are a mean, sour, un-
patriotic gathering, and would rather have the
Australian capital a poor place with no future
ahead of it than have it a great and noble city
which might some day overshadow their own
State metropolis. It would be too glaring to put
such a proposition into words, but that is the
whole measure of the prpposition none the less.
When the Australian Parliament set to work to
select a capital it looked for a healthy climate,
and the fact that Monaro is splendidly healthy
the death statistics clearly prove. It looked also
for a comparatively empty region, so that the
establishment of a new city would draw popula-
tion where it is really wanted, and not further
congest it where it is already too much congested,
and Monaro filled the bill. It looked for a fairly
fertile soil and a respectable rainfall, and it found
both on Monaro. It looked for a defensible site,
and the rampart which lies between Dalgety and
the coast supplies that. It sought for a place with a
big, swift, clean, ever-flowing river to supply drink-
ing water in abundance, also to furnish the neces-
sary substance to wash with, and enough water
over for electric lighting and electric power,
for cheap manufacturing purposes, and a surplus
wherewith to flush the city’s drains and irrigate its
gardens; and at the same time"it wanted a river
that wasn’t already in use for irrigation or to
supply any existing city. Naturally, it turned to
the Snowy, the one river in N.S.W. which was
running during the dreadful drought of 1902, and
which ran strongly all the time, and yet ran to
waste for want of population along its banks.
And the Australian Parliament also searched for
a place with a good handy port, so that the com-
merce of the new city might not be needlessly
dragged at absurd cost over many miles of
railway to anv remote State capital; and
here again Monaro, with Twofold Bay
within reach, filled the bill. And in
choosing Monaro the Australian Parliament
was guided in the first place by the advice of an
experienced and trusted officer, specially ap-
pointed by the N.S.W. Government at the re-
quest of the Federal authority, to report on
possible sites ; and it was further guided by the
clause in the Constitution which declares that, so
long as the capital site is within N.S.W. and not
less than 100 miles from Sydney, the selection
rests with the Australian Parliament and with no
other authority whatsoever.
* * * *
Against this selection the despicable little party
represented by Gregory Wade advances certain
counter propositions. It first of all leaves out all
mention of the interests of Australia, and devotes
itself solely, as heretofore, to “the claims of
N.S.W.” And then it proceeds, upon its own lone-
some responsibility, to define these claims. First,
it requires the abrogation of that clause of the Con-
stitution whielbleaves the selection of the capital
site, within certain limits, to the Australian Par-
liament, and demands, in effect, that the selection
shall be made by the N.S.W. State Legislature.
It demands also that the Australian capital shall
be a mean and hopeless place of no account, and
to that end it offers a dry and barren locality at
Canberra, with no port, little water, and no pros-
pects whatsoever. Wade’s Federal city is to
depend wholly on the little Cotter Creek, which
will hardly furnish a decent drinking supply for
a small city, which is too small to give power for
electric lighting or for manufacturing, and which,
in any case, the N.S.W. Government has already
annexed to help to fill its own Barren Jack reservoir.
Then Wade’s ideal Federal city is to be wholly
dependent on Sydney, 226 miles away, for its
sea outlet. It is to be located on a miser-
ably small bit of Federal tewitory, wholly
surrounded by State lands,wholly depend-
ent on the Wade Government for its road
and railway communication with the outer world,
and only getting such water, even from the paltry
little Cotter Creek, as Wade’s Administration is
pleased to allow it. In fact, according to the
Wade and Carkuthers theory, the Australian
capital is to be hopeless in every respect—not a
city to correspond with the greatness of Australia,
but rather one to correspond with the smallness
of Wade’s political soul.
*** , *
And, in pursuance of its craving for a Mean
City, the Wade party is never tired of assuring
the N.S.W. public that it (the public) is in strong
revolt against the idea of an Australian metropolis
on Monaro, where the climate and the magnificent
water supply and the splendid port make a
magnificent and prosperous capital possible. And
the Sydney Telegraph also assures the N.S. W.
community that it is in fierce insurrection,
and the S. M. Herald informs it that it is
full of stern resolve on the subject, and the
Evening News informs it that it has made up its
mind to resist to the last; and the Star wobbles,
with a leaning in its wobble to the same tale.
Yet, with all this violent shoving, N.S.W. makes
never a sign of having any objection at all to the
site that the Australian Parliament has selected.
The same authorities assure it that it is just craving
for a small humpy of a capital on the melancholy
Cotter Trickle, but, despite all their vigorous
assurances, A.S. W., as a whole, remains blank
and torpid, and reveals not one shred of interest
in the proposed Federal humpy by the Cotter
Trickle. Not even one meeting of 10 men and a
dog is known to have enthused, in any part of the
State, about Canberra or the Cotter Trickle, or
anything connected therewith. All the State
Premier’s expressions of hope “ that a site will be
selected acceptable to N.S.W.” fail to rouse that
State to the slightest show of an opinion that it
regards any site which can be selected as a
single fraction better than the one that has
been selected already. The only possible explana-
tion of this attitude is that the Cornstalk com-
munity isn’t the mean, jealous, peevish, quarrel-
some, unpatriotic dog that Wade and his press
supporters think it is, or pretend to think it is, or
want it to be. Apparently it sees no reason why
the Australian capital shouldn’t be a great and
elegant city beside a splendid river, instead of a
mere unprogressive townlet beside a muddy rivu-
let. It can’t understand why the rise of Twofold
Bay to the status of a great port, with a forest of
masts—the kind of port that would be a credit and
an ornament to Australia —should make it mad,
even if it makes Wade mad. It hasn’t grasped
Wade’s point of view, which seems to be that a
great wrong will be done to the State unless every-
thing is concentrated at Sydney—the trade of the
Federal city included. The misfortune of
the Mother State is that both its political
leaders have got, though in varying degrees,
the narrow-minded idea that it is neces-
sary, in the interests of N.S.W., to keep
Australia from progressing. Neither of them
has got the large Australian ideal. And the
public is an inert though well-meaning mass, and
doesn’t know exactly how to organise itself and
get new leaders.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Peaceful Madness of Strahan and Cohen.
Two ghastly travesties on the word “ patriotism ”
were exposed in Melbourne Age (15/8/’08). They
made their joint appearance at the Trades Hall
Council meeting the previous night. One was
called Strahan. He said
Even if there was an invasion of the Commonwealth he
did not think the workers should take up arms. Let
those who had something to lose do so.
The name of the other calamity was Cohen.
This was what Cohen had to say
He agreed with Mr. Steahan that the workers had
nothing to fight for. All they had was three meals a day
and a bed, and they carried the whole of their wardrobe
on their backs.
To put itshortly, theplea of the calamities Strahan
and Cohen was that the condition of the Aus-
tralian worker is so terrible that foreign conquest,
even Asiatic conquest, couldn’t make it worse—at
least it could make it so little worse that the dif-
ference wouldn’t be worth fighting for. They
repeat, parrot-like, the cry of the dreadful Tom
Mann, who will probably bolt with his savings
when the invasion looms, that the toiler has
“ nothing to lose but his chains.” Yet Strahan
and Cohen know perfectly well that the worker
has a heap to lose. He often has more
clothes that he can wear at once. He very fre-
quently has some furniture besides his bed—a
chest 'of drawers, for instance, isn’t unprece-
dented, and linoleum has been heard of. Occa-
sionally he even has a little money in the savings
bank—there were lately 1,258,689 depositors in
Australian savings banks—which means that more
than half the population that is sufficiently grown
up to open an account has one—and they had
an average of nearly £34 each to their credit. If
the Australian worker had no vote and no voice
in the management of the country, if he worked
10 or 11 hours a day for about Bd., lived on rice,
had a one-roomed hut with an earthen floor and
some rags and straw in the corner for a bed, and
wore a clout round his middle, and displayed
his ribs showing like the hoops of the old,
discarded crinoline through his skin, then
the sillv attitude of Strahan and Cohen
might be justifiable. And if the people
follow the advice of Strahan and Cohen, the
Australian worker will probably come to that
some day. These incredible persons say that only
the rich should take up arms in defence of Aus-
tralia when the invasion comes. Let us assume
that they do take up arms, while the great work-
ing masses, at the instigation of folk like Strahan
and Cohen, sit back in a state of torpor. The
Army of the Rich will then march out to meet
the enemv, carrying the only weapons in the
country. " It will boss the country—such parts
of it as are not bossed by the invader—for it will
be the only armed force in that part of Aus-
tralia still held by our own people, and a
brigade overrules all laws. The Army of the Rich
will probably not attempt to fight—there won’t be
enough of it—but it will negotiate. Even a small
army has a better chance in a negotiation than mo
army at all. It will ask that it shall be guaranteed
the secure possession of its own wealth. Onthese
terms it will probably assent to the abolition of
Parliament, the abrogation of trades unionism,
arbitration, and wages laws, the free admis-
sion of all Asia if it wants to come
here, the allotment of all unsold State lands
as farms to Asiatic immigrants, the fixing of a
maximum wage for artisans at, say, 2s. or 3s. a
day, liability to compulsory military service on
the part of Strahan and Cohen and the Trades
Hall Council and the working class generally m
the army of the conqueror, compulsory labor
(under Asiatic overseers) on the part of Strahan
and Cohen and their kind on roads and ( other
public works, and a forced loan out of the Savings
Bank (a loan, that is, of the savings of Strahan
and Cohen and the other workers) to pay the
invader’s war, expenses and other sundries. In fact,
the little Army of the Rich will have to take any
terms it can get, and it will naturally try to save
its own possessions out of the ruin, even at the
sacrifice of Strahan and Cohen. And then,
if Stkahan and Cohen try, when it
is too late, to fight with a chair-leg
against the inevitable, there will be two
forces to compel the fulfilment of the treaty
of peace—the invader himself and the Army of
the Rich, which latter will have all the available
up-to-date weapons in the country, the workers, at
the dreadful and insane instigation of Strahan
and Cohen, having wholly refused to take
up arms. And later, when the turmoil of
conquest has settled a little, the Rich,
having mighty little belief in the good faith of
their new rulers, will doubtless realise their pos-
sessions as best they can, and leave for Europe
with at least a fair share of their fortunes. And
Strahan and Cohen and their kind, not having
the means to get away, will remain behind and
carry wood and water for their new master Mr.
Monkey-Chrysanthemum.

The Tangle of Bent.
Thus a pressman in Melbourne: —
Not many Premiers have the art of getting into such a
tangle as Victoria’s T. Bent ; and in any case save Rent’s
the tangle would he fatal to the tangler. But Bent the
Bulky seems to have the luck of seven devils ; and, just
when he appears to be at the last political gasp, some-
thing happens and he is on his feet once more. When
the present session started, Bent unloaded a programme
of legislation sufficient to fill an ordinary wheat train.
The mere list of items constituted a decent memory feat.
Some of the proposed measures, too, were of a very
decent tonnage, and others were desperately controver-
sial, and hadn’t Buckley’s opportunity of being passed.
Thomas the Unwieldy emptied them all out together in
the House, just as the dustman tips up his load at the
rubbish depdt. And now the House is down on its
knees, grubbing amongst the cinders and banana-
skins, and looking for something valuable. The
weird tangle of Acts, in all conditions of drafts-
manship, is in itself a tall monument of the huge man’s
incompetency. But it is almost dwarfed by the adminis-
trative incapacity of the Government. Saving.in the one
direction of non-borrowing and the repayment of loans,
there is an aimless extravagance that is highly objection-
able. There never was such a tangle in the country’s
history as that of the Victorian Irrigation and Water
Supply Department. Millions of money have been spent,
and are still being expended, in constructing weirs and
channels and storage reservoirs, without half of them
having any water available. A Commissioner from
America has been placed in charge of this department, but
it doesn’t -rain any more now than beforebecame. Tijomas
has also a pretty tangle in the railways. A few months
ago, after listening to a cheeky farmers’ deputation,
he ordered the Commissioner to reduce both freights
and fares. Since then, there has been a slump in
production, and the railway surplus has got down
very near to vanishing point. Bent has the idea that he
can repair a thing like that by loud yells about the
country’s resources ; but even the loudest and most hor-
rifying yell isn’t as valuable to the railways as a load of
manure. The Lands Department is Bent’s third great
administrative tangle. In and out of season Thomas
roars that he has millions of acres of land available for
settlers; and all the time Victorian settlers are hurrying
away to N.S.W., Queensland, and Westralia. Amongst
the States, only one is really standing still in land settle-
ment, and that is Victoria. Altogether, the reign of
Bent is showing signs—great red-colored signs, too—-of
blocking the progress of his State. Probably a gun, if it
were allowable, would be the best remedy.
*
The Prospective £100,000,000 of Debt.
There is conspicuous need in N.S.W. of some
sort of an inquiry into the financial methods of
the Wade-Waddell-Wood Government—an in-
quiry, or a popularly-elected convention, or a com-
mittee in lunacy, or a referendum, or a few bank-
ruptcy proceedings, or something. There is
apparently no hope of getting the (Sydney daily
press to sound the alarm, for the Wade. Gover-
nment is a Government after its own heart.
It has Foreign-trade instincts for one thing,
it is also bitterly and unscrupulously anti-Federal,
and it is anti-Labor ; and a Ministry with these
beautiful qualifications might apparently borrow
£40,000,000 in a lump and spend it all in drink
without the Sydney morning papers even hinting
that it ought to reform. Yet the situation is
alarming enough to call for some remark.
The public debt of N.S.W. on the 30th June
last was £87,635,826. It had' increased during
the year by no less than £2,027,994—this despite
Wade’s great scheme for setting aside a fraction
of the land sales revenue for public works, and
despite the alleged surpluses, and despite, the
alleged sinking fund which isn’t a sinking fund
except in the sense that it sinks out of sight, and
despite the fact that the Carruthees-Wade push
first attained to office on the strength of its honest
indignation at Waddell’s extravagance (it has
since taken Waddell into its own combina-
tion and is shoving him into wilder ex-
travagance than he ever committed before).
N.S.W. has added £20,000,000 to its debt in the
past seven years, which is about as bad a record
as could be asked for. And so far, at least, as
last year is concerned there doesn’t seem to be
much to show for the heaping up of debt. On
31st December, 1906, the State had 3453 miles
of railway in working order (the Railway
Department makes up its figures to Decem-
ber, while the Treasury issues its balance-
sheet at June); on 31st December. 1907,
it had 3473 miles of line working. An increase
of 20 miles, mostly, if not wholly, single track,
doesn’t make a very great showing. And it must
be remembered that last year N.S.W. had the
biggest revenue it ever saw or heard of. The
Wade Government had £13,960,763 to spend. In
the year to 30th June, 1900, the N.S.W. re-
venue was £10,086,186, and out of that had to
be paid defence expenditure, postal and telegraph
expenditure, cost of running the Customs and
Excise departments, and many other charges now
borne by the Commonwealth. Now, as already
mentioned, the income is nearly £4,000,000
more, and it has not to cover these out-
lays. The N.S.W. State Statistician, in
his Monthly Statistical Bulletin for June
(page 18), reports that for purposes of fan-
comparison the N.S.W. revenue for 1900 must
be set down at £8,945,689, as against the present
£13,960,763 : that is to say that, by reason of the
extraobligations then and the lessened obligations
now the Wade Government last financial year
had ’really £5,015,074 more to spend than had the
Lyne Government in 1900. Yet it required
almost exactly as much loan money on top of
nearly £14,000,000 of revenue to keep Wade
going as it did on top of barely £9,000,000 of
revenue to keep Lyne going. Of course Wade
has a surplus and Lyne hadn’t, but if it is
necessary to borrow as much to-day with a surplus
as it was eight years ago without a surplus, there
is mighty little satisfaction in the surplus. Ihe
finances of the Wade-Carruthers pasty are a
mist, or a sieve, or a colander, or something
like that. There are great revenues, and great
surpluses (on paper), and great reforms (in theory),
but N.S.W. is booming steadily along towards a
debt of £100,000,000 all the same. And when it
reaches that consummation it will be up to the
State to hold another centenary celebration, it
is quite a while since it had a centenary.


The Fern and the Girl.
In Victoria the big estates where there are practi-
cally no men, women or children —only a big land-
lord and a wilderness and sheep—are sacred like
unto the Ark of the Covenant. They occupy the
rich, level, well-Watered and comparatively tree-
less country—the accessible land where no clear-
ing is required, and the settler can stick in his
plough the day he arrives and reap a harvest the
same year. Still the case of the small settler
isn’t qhite hopeless. He has the Mallee desert,
and he has the Gippsland mountains where the
big tree is one devil and the fern is another. The
daughter of one of Bent’s settlers related the
other day in a Melbourne morning paper how her
father and the family have wrestled with Nature
for 17 hard years on Gippsland’s sodden moun-
tains, and how much the struggle has yielded
them. Some extracts :
Father selected 170 acres in two blocks 17 years ago.
During those 17 years it has only produced enough to pay
the instalments and provide food for the family. We,
who are away from home, all have to contribute towards
the clothes. . . . My two brothers worked on it until
they were about 23, then they left home (with only
enough money to pay their fare) to work for Wages in
order to get some money to select for themselves. My
father and the other grown-up brother work early and
late. The latter starts at daylight and finishes up by
doing his share of the milking after dark. . . .
The two girls do almost a man’s work outside, as well as
the indoor work. There is only one member of the family
not old enough to help, and he will never make a bush
farmer, as he has had the fingers’ chopped off his right
hand. I asked father to educate him ;he says he has no
money. I asked him to add another room to the house,
as there is no accommodation for us when we go home ;
he says he cannot afford it. When the land is scrubbed,
burnt, and grass seed sown, the bracken ferns come up
thickly, often choking it out over acres together. Cut-
ting only weakens, but does not kill them, and it is a
difficult task, as the land is all steep and broken,
full of stumps and large fallen timber. The rabbit is
always with us. Only a few acres of the whole are level
enough to plough, and a single-furrow plough has to be
used. For many years we put the crops in by hand with
the chipping hoe. Had the land been given to us, it
would have been difficult to support a family properly.
My brothers were taken from school at the age of 12 ;
have worked continuously ever since. There is not one
of them in a position to marry, though the eldest is now
31. ... I can see nothing but a bare-looking cottage,
built of rough timber, a steep slope covered with bracken
ferns on two sides and half-an-acre of stunted orchard
on the other, which, although planted 14 years ago, and
receiving every attention, has never borne enough fruit
to supply the house.
And while that family, and hundreds like it, have
drudged hopelessly at the farm that is too steep
to be ploughed, the rich, empty Western plains
have been supporting a few foolish sheep and a
few arrogant squatters. What a pity these
Gippsland settlers can’t eat trees! Has anyone
tried boiled or fried tree ?
Where Gold is a Curse.
“ Kink ” sends in a vigorous protest:—
The curse of gold, as embodied in the greed of the
mining vandal, gets the Victorian farmers and pastoralists
down and throttles them. The waters of the noble Ovens
and the bonnie King, in the north-east, were once what
inland streams should be—pure, crystal clear. Then
slowly the mining vandal in the hills started sending down
his sludge, and the Ovens yellowed. With the years, the
state of the river became a scandal. But the mining mag-
nate is all-powerful. A whisper in the right quarter,
and any complaint was stifled. Now, with the floods of
the last quarter of a century, the,settlers’ original fences
are buried under succeeding layers of flood spume, while
the land, wherever the sludge has touched it, has
deteriorated. The Murray for several hundred miles is
rarely other than a milky or muddy trickle. Three days
a week the Ovens for miles is nothing more than mud-
soup for one section ; the rest of the week the other part
of the stream from Wangarattato the Murray is a disgrace.
After the. Christmas rains the Campaspe only rose about
6ft., though a flood was expected. Moreover, after many
days, the stream—which generally clears itself of ordinary
flood discolorations in two days—was still a dirty, muddy
slush, unfit for household purposes, and even distasteful to
stock. Sheep have perished in hundreds through being
bogged in the deluding flood spume. Nature was not too
good to Australia in the matter of rivers, yet what rivers
we have we thus pollute—more, we gradually fill up the
stream-beds. And while, for the sake of a few grains of
gold, we destroy the natural streams, we spend millions in
digging ditches and building dams. Could fatuity go
further !

The Rank Idiocy of being “ Loyal.”
Already the cry of the “loyalist ” strike-breaker
is loud in the Cornstalk land. The identical crowd
of “ right thinkers ” who, when the Sydney tram
strike was on a month ago, told this person he
was a hero, now treats him as a plain two-
penny nuisance and an obtrusive disturber of
their peacefulness. He who was formerly named
Man by anti-Union acclamation (but whose pre-
sent name is Mudd) no longer receives the glad
hand that is accorded the desirable citizen ; in-
stead he is passed the ice-cold collar-bone that is
the meed of the unfortunate drunk. An ex-
“ Loyalist,” higbt ,J. W. Reid,, was suffered to
discourse for three-quarters of a column in Sydney
Evening News (25/8/’08) on the craziness of going
strike-bursting. He told an instructive tale.
Before the strike Reid was in business in a
Sydney suburb as a photographer. He was “ not
in need of a job at the time.” He “had been
doing all right with his little photographic busi-
ness.” But “he did not believe in the strike,” so
he “ volunteered his services from a purely loyalist
point of view,” and went forth as a driver to do
battle against the wickedness that was in progress.
For three weeks he earned good strike-bursters’
money,. and beyond getting into one small diffi-
culty with a Bondi car, he gave fair satisfaction.
On August 13 liis job as driver came'to an end.
He resumed his calling of photographer. But,
behold, there was no longer money in it. Those
who had cheered him most loudly when he sallied
forth on the strike-fracturing trail turned aside
and had their “pictur” done elsewhere. He was
not treated by the rest of the community as an
upholder of law and order ; instead, women came
into his shop and “abused” him. Things did
not improve, so J. W. Reid went to Kneeshaw
(the same Kneeshaw who had slapped him on the
back and done him exceeding proud a month be-
fore) and told about his trouble. Kneeshaw said :
You can see the Chief Commissioner, but you will have
to put in an application. You might write a note asking
for a personal interview.
Next day Reid saw Johnson. But Johnson was
cold. This is the account of what befell when he
met Johnson :
Mr. Johnson would not do me the common courtesy to
look at my bills and papers, which I produced to show
that I had lo?t £BO, apart from the future business that
might have been possible but for my loyalty craze. Mr.
Johnson treated the matter in a light and airy fashion,
and said, “ Oh, you’ll get over that directly. We’ll give
you £5. I have no time to bother about your case this
morning:.”
Mr. Johnson slighted me. He treated my case as a
joke. Well, it may be a joke to him, but it is no joke to
me and my wife arid two children. If he were in the
same fix as I am in now, he would not find it a joke.
I would like to know also what became of the Loyalty
Reward Fund. I never got any of it, and I maintain that
some particulars ought to be forthcoming regarding its
disbursement.
And he finishes with this disillusioned moan :
Now, that is all one gets for loyalty. I have been ruined
through going to their assistance, yet all they offer is £5,
and insults. My wife said I ought to be put in a lunatic
asylum when I told her that I was going to drive, to help
the Government. She was right. I’ll guarantee that
after the way I have been treated by the Chief Commis-
sioner, no one would blame me for being sick of loyalty.
Reid’s surprise at his position indicates inexperi-
ence. It is a fixed opinion among employers of
labor, that the strike-breaker is practically always
something of a waster. They may be wrong in that
view, but, like Johnson, they havenT time to
listen to evidence on the other side. It is wonder-
ful how little time the Johnson family has after
the strike is over—and this .paper would be the
last to blame the Johnson family for it. In every
industrial concern it is the managers’ object (for
the sake of cash if they own the concern, for
the sake of their own credit if they don’t) to get
thebestsubordinates available. A strike comes, and
managers are driven unwillingly to take on any
kind of hero who offers himself. But when the
trouble is over they want the tradesmen back
again. They are glad to see the last of the posing
loyalist, and hope that they won’t even hear of
him again till the next strike. Reid’s experience
is not an isolated one by very long chalks. Sydney
is full of heart-sick “loyalists” whoareshunned by
folk in their own walk of life, and who have been
hunted off the doorsteps of the “upper classes”
with two or three sovereigns by way of full dis-
charge for their “ public-spirited gallantry ” last
July. The thing is a manifestation of what is
called “poetic justice”—which, when all is said
and done, is a fairly good brand of justice.
Industrial Insurance.
Before most of the people who generally regard
themselves as “ the well-informed section of the
community ” had realised the fact, Industrial in-
surance had got a good grip of Australia. Accord-
ing to figures in this year’s Presidential address to
the Insurance Institute of N. S. Wales, 72 of every
1000 people in Australasia hold Industrial poli-
cies. It is just upon 60 years since the A.M.P.
began to issue Ordinary policies ; but it is only
about 20 years since the canvasser began to pur-
sue Australia with the other sort of policy.
Moreover, the new sort of policy had very
few influential friends. The bigger and older and
better-known offices almost contemptuously dis-
regarded it. Yet, in spite of all that, for every
99 Ordinary policies, there are already 72 Indus-
trial policies in force. Gradually the almost
contemptuous disregard shown by most of the
older offices suffered a change—suffered so great
a change, in fact, that three years ago the
A.M.P., the greatest of all Australian offices,
decided to open an Industrial branch. There-
upon more attention began to be devoted to this
sort of insurance by “ the well-informed section
of the community.” These people knew some
thing about Ordinary insurance, for the most part;
and with that knowledge to guide or misguide
them, they were promptly shocked at some of the
things they discovered in connection with the In-
dustrial business. The Age found out that, under
a table by which the public was promised insur-
ance payable at death or at the end of 15 years, a
person paying in sixpence a week would hand
over in all £l9 10s. in 15 years, but would only be
entitled to receive back £l3 10s. at the end of
that period. To those who had grown accustomed
to Ordinary policy results that looked very shock-
ing. And it is very shocking. It is just
as shocking as the prodigious prices which
poor people have to pay for all sorts of
things which they can only afford—or think
they can only afford —to buy by the penn’orth.
Nobody ever accuses the A.M.P. Society of
being mismanaged in a general way. It has no
shareholders to pay profits to. Yet last year—
the third of its Industrial life—it found that the
expenses of this department mopped up over 88
per cent, of all the income. Of every £1 collected
from the Industrial insurers, the cost of canvass-
ing, collection, and management took 16s. That rate
may be reduced ; no doubt it will be reduced. As
the result of years of specialisation, the Citizens’,
which does most of this business in Australia, has
got the expense rate down to about 40 per cent, of
the premium income ; that is to say, the expenses
mop up Bs. of every £1 contributed by the people
who insure. But that is an exceptionally low rate,
and it would be impossible to do the work
for the money except by confining operations to
the comparatively well-peopled districts. It is
inevitable therefore that the benefits should be
wretchedly small when compared with those
given by the Ordinary branch —which is the
wholesale part of the insuring business. The sug-
gestion has been made that, in Victoria at any
rate, the Friendly Societies actuary should inves-
tigate, obviously with the view of ascertaining
whether the benefits are not too low. There cer-
tainly ought to be an actuarial investigation,
carried out on behalf of the Commonwealth ; but it
should be, not so much to see whether the prof-
fered benefits are too small, as to determine
whether some of the offices have a reasonable hope
of being able to pay what they have promised to
pay. That has been the trouble which the actu-
aries have found in connection with the friendly
societies: in nearly every case they undertook
to pay too much, with the result that, as lodges
and members have grown older, there have been
many cases of bitter disappointment and distress.
While Industrial insurance is still young, steps
ought to be taken to see that the foundations are
not laid for the same bitter disappointment in
connection with this new branch of thrift. But
the greatest reform can only come through the
development of a system of compulsory and uni-
versal insurance on the part at least of wage-
earners. No amount of actuarial investigation
will cut down the appalling waste in expenses
which is the inevitable and ineradicable blot on
the present system, and only a compulsory and
universal system can give insurance at anything
like cost price to the class of people who are most
in need of insurance.

Melbourne’s Amazing Board of Works.
Melbourne’s unwieldy and incompetent Board of
Perks is drenched with.trouble. It doesn’t know
what is going to happen to it, and sits about con-
templating the breathless prospect of the sack.
Bent, indeed, has fire in his eye, and says he is
going to remove these 40 portentous old ladies,
and replace them with a few of his own nominees
that will do his will and respect his won’t. Which
will only make matters worse. The Board of
Shirks, which is horribly incompetent and
ruinously expensive, only exists because there is
no Greater Melbourne. It is the creation of
municipal muddle. It,is impossible for the 22
councils to have 22 separate water supplies and 22
drainage systems, so the councils elect members
who form the Board of Lurks. The councillors
are elected on a bad, foolish old property franchise,
and are naturally a poor lot; and the men they
send to the Board are apparently still poorer. The
Board people are not paid, and their services are
dear at the price. And they aren’t braced up to
any extent by a healthy fear of losing their billets
at next election ; a man is elected as a councillor by
the people, but they don’t elect him as a Shirk,
and they don ? t feel that he is responsible to them
in his Herd of Shirks capacity. So the Board or
Plank has a deficit every year, and is nearly
£10,000,000 in debt, and isn’t seriously responsible
to anybody. A simple remedy would be to make
all th.e 22 metropolitan municipalities into one
Greater Melbourne, with its councillors elected on
a most liberal franchise; to make the Greater
Melbourne Council its own Board of Shocks ; and
to start it on its new career with a cast-iron law
whereby, if there is a deficit in any year, a special
rate muse be levied, whether the Council votes it or
not —levied automatically, that is, on the auditor’s
certificate—-to wipe out the shortage during the
next 12 months. But Bent’s threatened remedy
is to replace the badly-elected Shirks with his own
creatures who won’t be elected at all. If he does
that he might almost as well abolish municipal
government in Melbourne altogether.

Foolish Mundle.
One T. M. D. Mundle, of London, self-styled
“an Englishman and a member of his Majesty’s
navy,” passed what he called “ his opinion on the
whole affair ” (i.e., of Australian defence) in the
S. M. Herald the day after the United States
squadron sailed for Melbourne. Mundle’s opinion
was not a staggeringly new one. It turned out
to be the same old opinion that the non-
Australians who comprise the Anti-Defence party
pass enthusiastically every time they meet one
another—viz., that the Commonwealth should go
on hiring British mercenaries to frighten enemies
away from its corn and oil, instead of doing
the job itself. Mundle’s originality lay in the
weird argument whereby he buttressed the worn,
old doctrine. Mundle only advanced one argu-
ment. Here it is:—•
Australia is too young yet to have her own navy.
It strikes this paper as meriting a front-page situ-
ation and leaded type in the anthology of pub-
lished anti-Defence idiocies. At what age does a
nation qualify to defend itself without incurring
the contempt of Great Thinkers like Mundle ? ‘
If Australia is too young to defend itself on the
blue water it must also, presumably, be a pre-
sumptuous and callow ass to train troops to guard
itself on dry land; and it would be better served by
paying obliging foreigners to take on the contract.
And what are the fightingq ualities maturity is going
to give Australians that are now lacking in the
locally-born-and-bred mounted infantry-men who
did such excellent service for the Ma Land during
the S’African trouble nine years ago? By
Mundle’s brand of reasoning, William Squires
should not reach out for the heavyweight boxing
championship till he is an octogenarian.
'
Sick Citizens, or Sound?
Some very remarkable figures have been arrived
at by State-actuary Trivett, who some little
time ago finished the first complete valuation of
the friendly societies of N. S. Wales. Observing
that in the mining districts the funds of the
societies were mostly weak, he dug deeper in
order to find out how much more sickness there
was among miners—or, rather, in lodges where
miners predominate—than elsewhere. The re-
sults are startling. Take, for example, the
powerful Oddfellows’ society—Manchester Unity.
Assuming that sickness costs the non-mining
lodge £lOO, then approximately it costs the mining
lodge £136. When the age of 40 is reached the
disproportion becomes tremendous ; for the next
10 years the mining-lodge rate is no less than
£176 to the £lOO of the non-mining lodge.
That is to say, the miner between the age of 40 and
50 is sick and in receipt of something
over seven weekswhe rp CD ? average pers&rjiwho is
not a miner is sick only foqir weeks. Of . the two
great mining fields covered, hy this
castle’s sickness experienced? 16 percent,
par, and the Barrier’s (Brokeii Hill’s) no less than,'
42 per cent.; and the natural result is that
neither lodge “ district ” has 20s. in the '£ of its
liabilities. In connection with other societies
which serve mining districts the' same general
results are noted ; wherefore the actuary, viewing
the matter from the point which alone concerned
him for the moment, says that “the presence of
the mining class in any considerable propor-
tion on the rolls of a friendly society will
have an adverse effect, to a pronounced degree
. . . and will greatly increase the difficulty
of attaining and retaining a solvent condition.”
And the chances are that the bad effects won’t
stop with the one generation ; it seems almost
impossible that a strong, satisfactory progeny can
come from men engaged in an occupation which
is up to 75 per cent, more unhealthy than all other
occupations are on the average. Even, however,
on the figures themselves, it seems obvious that
mining is not the business that the State
ought to go very far out of its way to
foster so long as there are other businesses
awaiting encouragement. The duty of the State
is rather to see that the mine-owners adopt every
possible plan for preserving the health of their
employees. The owners whine in most cases,
when the State interferes in such matters, that the
thing won’t pay if they have to do this, that, and
the other thing ; and the State most often agrees,
backs out —and leaves the miner to suffer.
Yet the State’s clear national duty is twofold :
first, to sit down hard and say that if a mine can’t
be worked without turning citizens into invalids
or corpses, it had far better not be worked at
all; second, to open up other avenues of employ-
ment. And where we should look for those
avenues a comparison shows —it shows the position
of the first three and the last three "districts”
in the previously-mentioned Oddfellows’ order :
Cash Assets per £1 Sick rate per
of Liability. cent, of Standard,
s. d.
Wagga .. .. 9 10 .. 82 per cent.
Tamwortb .. .. 8 0 .. 77 ~
Clarence Eiver .. 4 4 .. 78 ,*
Hunter River .. 411 .. 107 ~
Barrier .. .. 10 .. 142 ~
Newcastle.. ..13 .. 120 ~
The first three are agricultural districts ; the last
three are mining, or mostly mining. Midway
between them stands Sydney, largely manufactur-
ing, with 6s. 7d. of cash assets in its Sick Fund,
and asick rate of 91 per cent, of the standard. In
Victoria T. Bent proposes to spend a few tens of
thousands to “ encourage mining.” N. S. Wales
annually spends several tens of thousands with
the same object. And all the time, without spend-
ing a cent, they both could, if they chose, encour-
age what is clearly the far more healthy business
of agriculture, by forcing vast areas of practically
idle lands into use. In at least two of the dis-
tricts where the sick rate is from 20 to 30 per cent,
under the average, as shown above, there are
huge areas of scarcely-used land. Tamworth is
hemmed in and smothered and shackled by the
Peel River Estate. There were already 10,000
reasons why this and other land should be forced
into use; Actuary Trivett’s friendly societies’
figures make the 10,001 st.
Westralia lately witnessed the curious spectacle
of a number of indignant Fat gentlemen enthusi-
astically demanding that somebody should go and
organise a crowd of workmen, and form them into
a union, and get them registered. The big
Boulder and KalgOorlie mines are many hundreds
of miles away from any coal at all, and many
thousands of miles away from any coal that they have
a fancy for ; so they burn up thousands of tons of
firewood instead. The wood-choppers are prob-
ably the most mixed lot of workers in Australia —
largely Austrians, Italians, Slavs and Monte-
negrans, with a vast fair Scandinavian here and
there. Lately, in spite of the mixture, they
decided with startling unanimity to take
a spell from axe-swinging, while their bosses, the
wood cos., thought over a demand for another 3d.
a ton for chopping. The big mining cos. never
dreamt that there was a unanimous strike in that
heterogeneous crowd, and had no stock of fuel on
hand; so there was a general shut-down looming
ahead. It loomed so close, in fact, that at one
time nearly 3000 miners and others had to be
knocked off. Then the Attorney-General and
Premier Newton Moore were rushed on to the
scene, and were implored to do something. The
Premier undertook to arbitrate, and, every-
body agreeing, he decided that the strikers
ought to get just about all they asked
for. It was while things were hung up,
and threatened to be hung up still higher,
that the Fat gentlemen went round demand-
ing that somebody should go and form the choppers
into a union—one of those awful labor unions !
—and register them under the Arbitration Act.
But somehow the Arbitration Act isn’t quite as
popular as it might be in the West; from the
workers’ point of view it has been rather unfor-
tunate in some of its decisions. So while Fat
cries aloud to Labor to organise, Labor smiles at
the turn things have taken, and holds off. And,
though they don’t quite see it at present, that
will no doubt suit the Fat gentlemen better in the
end ; it is only about once in 100 times that unor-
ganised labor can win, and this happened to be
the once.
♦
Heaven only knows what is happening to Vic-
toria’s T. Bent these days. He opened the
session with a gigantic programme of reforms
which was calculated to keep the Legislature
going full speed for 12 months. But hardly one
of his Bills seemed to be ready, and the Assembly
sat and looked at itself, and talked over chronicles
of small beer, and adjourned early and often. At
last it climaxed the performance by shutting up
for three weeks because the Yankee Fleet was
going to be in Melbourne harbor for five days.
Now there is practically no news that even one of
the barrow-load of promised great reform measures
is making any definite progress, but there are
shrieks of eldritch laughter from the Ministerial
apartment where a Newspapers Bill is allegedly
being drafted. According to Bent’s report
(or alleged report) this wonderful Bill is to pro-
vide that “ every article or paragraph containing
remarks or Observations upon any political
matter” must have attached to it the full, real
name of the writer in type twice as large as that
in which the item itself is printed, so that all
these splashes of big print will make a page of
political items look like a small field dotted over
with large rabbits. Also anybody who disputes
the accuracy of any statement may demand the
insertion of a “correction” (also fully signed)
which may be twice as long as the original state-
ment but mustn’t be longer. And Bent says
proudly that there are a lot more provisions of the
same kind in his Bill, which promises to be a
curious and untidy measure, looking something
like a scrambled egg that has gone mad. Why
don’t Bent’s colleagues get their respected chief
down and sit on him? But perhaps the News-
papers Bill is only an amusing hoax.
A Belated Warning to Melbourne.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“ I’ll give you a word of warning,” exclaimed the Rev.
G. Trf.oear at a meeting for men at the Collingwood
Mission. “ You who have mothers, daughters, sisters,
and sweethearts, look out for them next week.”
Voices : “ Nonsense,” “ What rot.”
The Rev. G. Tregear said that he was quite serious. He
was simply giving a word of warning. If it was not
heeded many a girl might rue the day the American fleet
came to Melbourne.
To all fathers, husbands, brothers,
Cousins, uncles, blokes, and others
Who have sweethearts, wives and mothers,
Words of warning I would speak.
To the youth who has a sister,
Or who wanted one—and missed her,
’Cause he scarcely ever kissed her
More than once or twice a week.
To each one, I say, you oughter
Keep your own —or someone’s —daughter
From approaching near the water
When the Yankee fleet is due.
When the warships come to anchor.
From the rocky headland yank her.
Take her home and gently spank her—
That is my advice to you.
When you hear the steamers buzzin’
Grab your sister or your cousin,
Grab your wives—if you’ve a dozen—
Grab each mother you possess.
Bring them all to church on'Sunday
And to Bible Class on Monday—
When the worthy Mrs. Grundy
Will deliver an address
On the sinfulness and folly
Of a pleasant life and jolly—
On the joys of melancholy
And the glee of being Dead ;
On the wickedness of funning
With a sailor, bold and cunning,
For you never know what’s running
Through his cropped and crafty head.
Modest maidens of eleven—
Maids right up to ninety-seven—
Maids who ought to be in Heaven —
Maidens ripe and maidens, green.
Maidens sixty years and under
Have been sometimes known to blunder,
And to weep when torn asunder
From a wicked horse marine.
Oh, my young friend, blithe and cheery,
Oh, my brother, dull and bleary,
Should the ladies make you weary,
Kindly trot them round to me.
They may rest upon my shoulder,
Or, perchance one may be bolder,
And suggest that I should hold her
Till the ships are out at sea !
N.s.w.

Unification and Reconstruction.
The Unification and Reconstruction party holds
a meeting this (Thursday) evening at Sydney
Protestant Hall. Considering that it is the per-
sistent habit and lie of the State Frights party to
represent the movement as one which aims at
having all power centred in one Parliament and
Government, which will be responsible for every-
thing down to a drain at Port Darwin, it is worth
while to again state the real intention of the move-
ment. It is proposed that a popular vote shall
place all power temporarily in the hands of the
Commonwealth. The Commonwealth will thus
take over all the debts as they stand without any
elaborate calculations about the odd 2d., all the
railways, lands, deficits, gaols, and generally the
entire show. Then Australia will be re-divided into
smaller and more convenient States, each with a
small Legislature of one House eledted on an
adult suffrage basis. Most of the powers which
were transferred to the Commonwealth will
then be handed back, and many of the
assets-. But the Commonwealth will keep
all the debts and make them one uni-
form Federal liability, and start paying them
off. Also, it will keep the railways, and set to
work to put them all on a uniform gauge, so that
the same train can run from one end of Australia
to the other, and it will try to build all new rail-
ways so that they will connect the interior with
the nearest port, instead of compelling scores or
hundreds of miles of needless haulage in order to
drag everything to Sydney or Melbourne.
The movement will do away with Upper
Houses of Rich Landlords or Old Nominees, and
thus clear a dreadful snag out of the path of
State progress. Likewise it will clear away many
other snags. The details of the Scheme for the
Great Cleaning-Up will, of course, be worked out
at greater length before it is submitted to a popu-
lar vote. Meanwhile, everybody should sign the
Unification and Reconstruction Petition, which
can be found on the premises of Mr. Steel, 194
Castlereagh-street, Sydney, and everybody should
attend the meeting and whoop for the good cause.
Apparently the Victorian outcry against the
presence of sand in artificial manures is being used
to push on a foreign superphosphate—and a Jap
article at that. The Jap article hasn’t got
as much _ sand in it as the Victorian-
made article; but it has gypsum instead.
The whole point is : Is gypsum more valuable
than sand ? Those who know what plants want
to eat sav both are equally valueless. Sand has
this virtue over gypsum, however —it doesn’t
absorb moisture so readily, and therefore is easier
to apply in a drill. When the Victorian cdbky is
told (1) that manures are adulterated with
sand, and (2) that there is sand in Victorian-
made manures, he needs to ask two ques-
tions of the man who tells him these things,
and who, in nine cases out of 10, will want
to sell him a foreign (generally Jap) ’fertiliser—(l)
Has the foreign muck any bigger percentage of
phosphoric acid ? (If it hasn’t, it isn’t a better
fertiliser.) (2) What has the foreign muck got in
place of the sand ? Ninety-nine times out of 100
he will be told “gypsum”; and gypsum only
sounds better—it isn’t better.
The reform which has been threatening the Bent
State’s Lands Department for a long, long time is
again emerging from the horizon, and again is it
another novelty in clown’s attire. This time it is
seriously intended to appoint a Director of Land
Settlement, a gentleman from outside the service,
whose job will be to deal with all classes of land
settlement now undertaken by the Lands Depart-
ment. Apparently he is to direct the aspiring
land seeker to the millions and millions of acres of
earth which are supposed to be available under
the ordinary Land Acts, the Closer Settlement
Act, and the Improved Small Holdings Act. The
virtue of the idea is alleged to lie in unity of ad-
ministration, and in the removal of work from the
Lands Department, which is certainly in the last,
dreary stages of creeping circumlocution. The
Director might, conceivably, prove of some use if
he had some land to work with ; but as he hasn’t,
he can only be an expensive finger-post to the
wilderness.

Perth (W. A.) is the first city in the Common-
wealth to get an insight into the machinations
of the Meat Trade. A local butcher named
Sketchley has started the prosecution of
nine members of the Retail Butchers’ Association
on a charge of conspiring to prevent him getting
supplies. His evidence was calculated to bring
down a shower of housewives’ blessings on his
head. He stated that when the wholesale
butchers lately fixed a new schedule of rates the
Retail Butchers’ Association raised the scale of
prices to consumers, but he refused to join because
he could make a good living by selling at much
lower rates than they fixed. Whereupon the
Association threatened him in the first instance,
and presently stopped his supplies. He could not
obtain meat in the wholesale market for cash. He
was told he was black-listed. The president of
the Retail combinecalled him a pigheaded fool, and
another member of the juicy joint warned him
that his legal action was a wild-goose chase (a
foolish figure of speech, considering that he
was chasing beef and mutton), and that he
would himself be dead meat before he got a ver-
dict. Although Sketchley’s prosecution is
limited to the nine men who sell prime cuts from
the gore-stained block, and charge what they like
for it, counsel will endeavor to prove that the
wholesale dealers are fellow-conspirators with the
retail association. Looming in the background is
the question as to how many butchers’ shops are
controlled by wholesale dealers, and how far the
graziers are concerned (if at all) in this alleged
combine to victimise the public.

On August 28 the S. M. Herald published an
article entitled “ While the Iron is Hot.” Some
sparks that were thrown off through the Herald
hitting the hot substance with its head were as
follows :
If the necessary literature were dispatched in the right
hands it should not be difficult for the Commonwealth to
do good business in New York, and so continue the
advertisement we have already received, with many
multiplied advantages. American farmers are swarming
into Canada. Why should not part of the stream, at any
rate, be diverted this way? Certainly the spreading of infor-
mation throughout the States would be worth while, and
from the great business centres the way would be opened
through the advance guards which have already gone in
cabled messages and through the tons of letters and news-
papers which will soon be distributed by the post offices.
But we do not forget that such a forward movement
should take in Great Britain. It means, of course, a
sound, strong, comprehensive policy of immigration,
based upon the spending of much money along lines
approved by Canadian experience, though modified by
Australian needs and conditions.
But what an insulting mockery is the Herald’s
cry for a “sound, strong, comprehensive
policy of immigration,” to bring farmers
pouring into this country when every little
farm that the State has to offer brings a rush of
from 40 to 200 frantic applicants ! Until the big
estates are broken up wholesale to provide land
for small settlers, and laws are passed to prevent
new big estates being formed, it is a cruel fraud to
bring even one farmer to N.S.W.—the State that
is driving away its own young men because it
won’t provide them with a bit of soil. And when
did the S. M. Herald lend the weight and stodge
of its influence to any policy of breaking up the
big estates ? So far as the public can remember —
never.
S. M. Herald is preparing apparently to drop
its opposition to Prime Minister Deakin’s Aus-
tralian navy proposals with a sharp thud. It
published (29/8/’08) these words of horse sense :
For her protection Australia looks to the greatest of
all the fleets, the Royal Navy. Those who saw the 16
white ships in the harbor, and realise that there are six
more, of a value of over £12,000,000, now on the stocks at
home, cannot help beginning to wonder how long Eng-
land can continue to give us absolute safety. This
great fleet, with the 10 huge cruisers of the Pacific
Fleet which it will meet at Manila, is not being
built to compete with England, but with the second fleet,
which is Germany’s. And England, with 40,000,000
people, sets herself to build a fleet bigger than these two
nations of 60,000,000 and 80,000,000 can build together.
Now that race must have a limit, and it cannot be far off.
But though the strength of one sea power gives out, a
bundle of separate rich sea powers, all of the same race
and ready to fight for the same objects, may easily own
betvveen them such a navy or bundle of navies as, taken
together, could say yes or no to the world. The Governor-
General himself spoke of a day when Australia may repay
this visit. And the Australian, after seeing with his own
eyes the fleet which, for this time being at least,
has actually the command of the Pacific, can-
not help understanding something more of his
obligations to himself and the Empire than he
understood last week. It may cost a deal to
build a fleet, but we know in our own heart of hearts
that no nation in the. world could afford it better. Aus-
tralians learned this all from their dress circle. They could
never have learned it better than within a single hour on
the day the Fleet sailed ; when at 9.15 the last of the 16
battleships of the American Navy came through the
Heads ; and at 9.27 precisely the Australian Navy came
out after it, with its big gun poking out of its bows, and
punched manfully through seas far too big for it, to
Brisbane.
This amounts to a jettisoning of Reid’s yarn
that the Commonwealth is too insolvent owing
to Federation to afford a navy. Australia, for all
its “ grinding ” tariff—the tariff which was alleged .
by the Herald, the other day, to have reduced the
purchasing power of the sovereign to 15s. locally,
and to have caused want to stalk into the dining-
room of the “ middling classes ” —is now admitted
by the Herald to be so rich that it is as well able
to afford a navy as any other nation in the world.
And regarding the naval subsidy, there is a dead
and cheering silence.
Some Sydney Art.
The Royal Art Society’s Exhibition in Sydney is,
considered as wall-acreage, chiefly W. Lister
Lister; considered as art it is E. Phillips Fox and
Norman Carter. This year the Art Society
retains its pre-eminence as a chamber of horrors.
Its habit of indiscriminate kindness is apparently
growing with age ; its smile of invitation to every
beginner who can hold a brush is fatal to the
character of the show ; and the really good work in
it is not improved by the company it is compelled
to keep. Yet, obliterating all memory of the
tawdry and inefficient, there is a distinctly higher
average of good work than last year. The work of
E. Phillips Fox would dignify—and has dignified
—any exhibition in the older art centres ; and
yet our Art Gallery trustees have not awakened to
the fact that it would be criminal to allow these
works to leave Australia. This year marks in
Norman Carter an all-round advance, promising
much. His big selection of sturdy and conscien-
tious work includes fine black-and-whites, admir-
able portraits, and landscapes that show the
imaginative quality which is usually kept severely
under restraint in portraiture. His official por-
trait of Allen Taylor is a fine, solid thing in the
formal and official manner. His “ Study in
Brown,” however, shows him in a more sympa-
thetic and less restrained mood ; and the purchase
of this work by the Art Gallery trustees leads us
seriously to reconsider the question of sticking
the heads of those estimable gentlemen on the
railings outside the Gallery. Carter’s work is
always conscientious. He has the grounding
necessary for the next obvious step —a trip to the
art-world overseas. L. Bernard Hall is repre-
sented by two portrait heads, painted, as usual,
against a background of weird-hued space. The
modelling of the faces is so admirably done that
the color scheme hardly does more than exas-
perate. But it raises the question whether it
would not be worth Bernard Hall’s while to con-
sult an oculist in order to discover if he has not a
color abnormality in his vision. It is probably
the sickly green background that has made him
paint one girl’s face purple. But there can be no
doubt about his admirable technique. A. H.
Eullwood supplies monotypes of merit, and
several delicate, transparent studies of English
greys. B. E. Minns forwards his usual
complement of daintiness and charm. A. J.
Burgess shows a number of large, uninteresting
seascapes, painted, however, with a stolid ability.
“The Rosebud,” by G. E. Butler, is a worthy
attempt, despite slurred difficulties in the drapery.
“The Floating Harbor, Bristol,” has fewer diffi-
culties and better achievement. “ Sisters,” by A.
J. Fischer, with its cheap sentiment ladled out
with luscious paint, is the obvious story-picture
never absent from any exhibition. A. Datillo-
Rubbo can always be depended upon to provide
this sort of thing, and his “ Oh ! for the Touch of
a Vanished Hand ” does it admirably, the figures
being apparently painted under the limelight. J.
Muir Auld has a pained portrait, with
good work in the oddments. His sea-
pieces display a conscientious ability. In
“Traumerei,” though obviously nothing more
than a model posed, .T. S. Watkins achieves a
rather cheap effect of flesh seen through a black
veiling ; but the picture is spoiled by the muddy
face he has given his model. J. Wolinski sends a
photographic transcript of a London coffee stall.
J. Jackson’s'“Harmony in Red ” is marred by an
arm in a sleeve inadequately foreshortened.
Similar weakness is seen in the wooden treatment
of the little girl’s legs in his “Dorothy”—a portrait
“ after ” Velasquez. Velasquez, however, is still
several laps ahead. James L. Scott is evidently on
the right road. His “ Under the Figs ” achieves
a fine decorative effect, though, if he had not
obtruded the realism and kept the work as a de-
coration, the effect would have been more satisfac-
tory. His other works are serious in intent, and
more than promising. Will Ashton has some
workmanlike sketches of back streets; but his
bigger work is disappointing. J. W. Tristram
sends in his usual assortment of enormous moons ;
but his work, delicate and suggestive, and
satisfying in the rendering of evanescent
atmospheric effects, survives any number of bulky
moons. Gerald Fitzgerald has some interesting,
though not especially noteworthy work, while the
quiet water-colors of E. F. Peck demand mention
as artistic in intention. R. W. Phelps, William
Heron, and Bernice Edwell are names that also
need mention. And, to conclude, the curious will
find a Tebbitt that looks like nothing else on earth
but a Tebbitt.

After all the challenging talk about its
“essentially poetic treatment,” “ Peter Pan,”
which was produced at Sydney Royal last week,
comes as something of an anti-climax. The central
idea of a supernatural who comes for a while
under the spell of human love, and then flits back
to fairyland, is as poetic as it is old. Shakspeare,
Ibsen, Matthew Arnold, Wells, Anstey, Yeats,
and a score of others, have exploited it, each in
his own manner. “Peter Pan,” a new variant
on this worn theme, with its whimsicali-
ties and the quaint and pretty sayings of its
little folk, is in the best Barrie manner. Yet
the comparison that is suggested on the sampler
drop-curtain between this fairy story and (say) a
Hans Andersen tale is literary blasphemy. To
enjoy the worthiest parts of “Peter Pan,” the
adult must not, as he is so insistently urged to do,
“forget that he has ever grown up.” Peter’s
humor and philosophy are essentially for grown-
ups—and for more or less literate grown-ups at
that. Real children hate sentiment, and “Peter
Pan” contains enough of it to stock a kailyard.
Certainly the child is catered for in one important
respect. A delightful spirit of adventurous-
ness pervades the play. Children worship the
same god the earliest Romans did—Fright. They
love to be horrified. The would-be entertainer
of extreme youth, with a perfectly sweet little
idyll to relate concerning a fair (though unevent-
ful) young mother and her sainted (and hence
dull) babe, will be deserted in short order in favor
of one who has to tell of robbers, the blood-tinged
Spanish main, and such-like alarming things.
There is a brooding atmosphere of horror over all
the doings of Captain Hook and his merry men
which is calculated to charm any young person
with the morbid and ferocious-minded condition
that accompanies robust juvenile health.
• * * *
We are offered many interesting glimpses
in “Peter Pan” of Barrie’s mastery of stage-
craft. How adroit he is ; and how well he knows
us who frequent theatres! When dear little
Tinker Bell, the fairy (whose rdle is effectively
handled by a dancing spot of calcium-light),
grows dimmer and dimmer, and seems near to
death, Peter runs to the footlights, and in the
most fascinating way tells the audience that if it
will only “show it believes in fairies” by
applauding, Tinker will recover. And forthwith
aged citizens, who outside the theatre wouldn’t
even believe in a mining prospectus, fall to con-
cussing their hands wildly and stamping as though
possessed. As a fact they are possessed,
momentarily, by the spirit of Smollett-like senti-
mentality which is the essence of this play.
MRS. EICHORN and
MRS. SCHULTZ
(in “Mrs. Wiggs ”
at Her Majesty’s,
Sydney).
There is nothing mystic about Tittell
Brune, who plays the name part. In the
hands of her Peter, the “ Pagan horn ” appears an
unseemly instrument. A concertina would be more
appropriate. She suggests, with her rich, young
voice and abrupt movements, a vigorous lad having
the time of his life. And so, when she forees her
way into the realms of fantasy, and tells us in
suppressed tones that “every time a baby laughs
for the first time a fairy is born ” or claims exult-
ingly to be “ Youth ” ! and “ Joy ” ! ! she seems
incongruous. She is at her best when excur-
sions and alarums are afoot, and all the
genuine children in the front of the
house are sitting up, and feeling interested.
Loring Fernie’s Hook is fine. This mariner is the
real thing. Ashen and menacing of face, gorgeous
as to clothing, he appears to the life the pirate
skipper of childhood’s musings. Florence Kelly
makes Wendy Darling a delightful maiden, and
Michael Nicholas (Rosie Fitzgerald) is a distract-
ingly neat, good, and clever little boy. In sooth,
all the small people do well. They play like
veterans to a child. There are a host of well-
sustained minor characters, and the stage-produc-
tion is a joy and a wonder to the beholder.

Sydney has been taking its sore head and
its nearly empty pockets to Her Majesty’s in
very large numbers, and there it has been learning
philosophy from Mrs. Wiggs of the Cabbage
Patch. Though you couldn’t well have two shows
more unlike than “ Mrs. Wiggs ” and “ Peter
Pan,” yet they light on practically the same text.
Peter is the youngster who doesn’t want to grow
old; Mrs. Wiggs is the grass widow who
doesn’t want to put up her umbrella until
it rains. Whether it is the text that Aus-
tralia is most in need of is another matter.
Mrs. Wiggs’s umbrella doctrine is all right,
no doubt, so long as you’ve got an umbrella to put
up when it does rain ; the weak point is that the
yarn doesn’t lay enough stress on the necessity of
getting the umbrella. Still Mrs. Wiggs and half-
a-dozen others are fine and complete character
studies, photographic in their fidelity to type,
though even Ithe heroine’s type isn’t the perfect
one. Mrs. Wiggs can produce ’most anything
from under the bed—one place is as good as
another in her philosophy—wherefore Mr. Wiggs,
who “ went West,” probably deserves a bit more
sympathy than the play intends that he
MRS. WIGGS (at Her
Majesty's, Sydney).
should get. When
Wiggs missed his
train four times
in a week through
Mrs. Wiggs’habit
of storing Wiggs’
collars away along
with the pickles
—well, perhaps
Mrs. Wiggs isn’t
such a heroine,
after all.

Burns and
Squires are light-
ing their battle
over again at Syd-
ney Palace
through the me-
dium of the flick-
ergraph. Minute
intervals are eli-
minated, but the
picture is ext< i. I-
ed to an hoe 's
duration by the
inclusion of the
champion’s train-
ing preparations.
The nuggety
Burns is seen
skipping, punch-
ing the ball and
otherwise conducting himself as a Great Pug
with a fight on hand and a lot of money on him.
Also Squires is seen coming “down centre” in
his training quarters at Newcastle, and a cheering
horde hemming him in. Then ensues the fight
itself, with the lightning-quick strokes of padded
forepaws and the quick-stepping elusiveness of
hind paws, as the trained animals attack or defend
themselves. It is all very' dramatic, even to the
knock-out blow, for the gore is not visible, neither
is the sound of tfiuds audible, and the smitten
champion rises in sight of the audience from the
knock-out pat, and the audience goes home by
tram-loads knowing there will be no funeral.
“Standing room only” has been the legend per-
manently at the Palace portals since the contest
has been added to the programme. Anyone
spilin’ for a fight need no longer spile for sight
of one.

That crinkled little man of mirth, Frank
Thornton, is due at the Palace on Saturday, with
“ The Private Secretary.” The “ Secretary ” was
amazingly funny once,, as were also “ Our Boys ’
and “ Pink Dominoes.” Whether it will strike
the new generation in the same place as it did the
old one depends on whether the fashion in humor
has changed very much during recent years.
Somehow, though a new population has arisen
which knoweth not “Pink Dominoes,” no manager
seems to think it worth while to revive that
old money-maker ; yet those who are now elderly
fathers laughed at it till they fell down and nearly
broke their necks.

“ Miss Hook ” is now in her manyth week
at Sydney Criterion, and the bait upon her is still
fresh, and the public is biting freely.

For the Free Kindergarten, [Gounod’s
“ Faust ” was sung on Saturday night in concert
form, commonly called “in camera.” This inky
wayfarer cannot lay hands on the ragged Latin
dictionary that is sometimes consulted, and is
sometimes used to keep a door open, and some-
times flung at an intruding creditor or dog—hence
the term “dog-Latin.” But a dim remaining
fragment of the coffin of a dead language impresses
the writer with the idea that “camera” means a
room, among other things; so, for the nonce,
Sydney Town Hall was a “room,” and the
Grand Opera presented by the infant society
drew so surprisingly that the room was crammed in
every part. Mrs. Slapoffski, as Marguerite, sang the
music of the glorified daisy perfectly. Mr.
Andrew Black, as Mephistopheles. did the mag-
nificent bounder proud, and his “Clear the way
for the calf of gold” was worth giving up the
pleasant Saturday afternoon out-of-doors to hear.
But the Faust of Mr. Harry Neil, a new tenor,
was the surprise of the production. Anything
startlingly good and new in our midst deserves
the tribute of agreeable surprise. Mr. W. Asprey
conducted his amateur orchestra with his usual
success ; Mr. Staell led the fiddle brigade, and
Mr. Sykes handled the big organ as it deserved
and as his reputation demanded.

A One of the most popular shows in
Adelaide, these times, is that of a travelling
auctioneer, who gives a concert complicated by
strange contests, such as tug-of-war by girls, or
bobbing for apples. Sometimes there are more
important trials of strength, and always there
are gifts for everybody in the audience. These
vary from a lamp down to a pencil-case, and the
Government has just failed in a prosecution of the
showman for running a lottery. He gives pictures
of the American fleet. Pictures of the Yankee navy
are also at the Tivoli. A quite new show-place,
calling itself the Pavilion, has sprung up to exhibit
pictures of the United States warships. Uncle
bam s armada is in grave danger of becoming
(per him) something of a nuisance. Mark Ham-
bourg has come and gone; Mayor Johnson has
given a free concert to his joyous citizens ; and
the leading amateur crowd, the Appendreena,
has played that quaint old relic of the retired-
comedy days, “The Guv’nor.” Also
xt 6 JV S 3rry Widow,” superbly staged (with
Henry Bracy in command), has finished a
triumphant fortnight at the Royal. The piece
seems to captivate the more on second or third
hearing, and a serious accident to Higginson, who
had to be replaced by O’Connor, a most capable
understudy, did little to injure its run. Now
Julius Knight and Miss Humphrey have come
in, with “The Scarlet Pimpernel ” ; and it is a
distinct help to the box-office that one of the most
popular of Adelaide’s society girls has enlisted in
the co. The play is, contrary to usual experi-
ence, better as a drama than the book- was as a
novel; but then the book was essentially dramatic
■ —in form, anyway.
“Les Cloches de Corneville” is produced
at Melbourne Royal with all its ancient atmosphere
that no amount of modern pretty girl chorus
can dissipate. It is stuck and glued in place with
tradition as toy soldiers are glued on stands, or as
barnacles cling. to the garboard strake. Wilson
Pembroke (the Marquis and pet lady-killer) sings
with the ease of an angel, but his fat, belted
and curled appearance is fatal; he has little
chance of any beauty-actor adoration, though
worship, to be sure, comes easily to
a baritone in impressive boots. Edward
Wvnn, as lover Grenicheux (a fisherman),
18 even more stolid, and stands around
with the grace of a German saveloy vendor. His
voice is good but small—probably the fault lies in
*£^u iev^ ness his company and the foreign pitch
of the theatre. Miss Eileen Hodgson (Germaine)
suiters from the same trouble—a pretty girl with
a sweet voice, but in whose first-night manner
there was the cringing of abject stage terror. She
had a vivid contrast in Miss Stella Gastelle
(berpolette, waif and mock countess), a young
mdy who knows her business from first to last,
.tier voice is excellent, and her brightness and
vivacity in which one detects a Nellie Stewart
flavor, help the show considerably. Gobo, the
bailie s shadow (Mr. Stephens), gets enough out of
his rather small part to make the public look
for something good in some future play.
Ihe shadow certainly suffers by being
forced to follow so heavy a substance as
Snazelle up to date. When the Snazelle-bailie
dances or frivols there is a feeling that he would be
happier in a state of calm repose. MacNaughton
.Duncan makes a laughable Gaspard. Gaspard,
the miser, who should make folks’ skin cree-ep as
he chinks his go-o-old in the dusk of the grim
goblin castle, is just an animated calf that has in
some way got shut in a room. The mounting is
very fine, and here young George Upward gets his
first chance to score heavily as a scenic artist.
Ihe first scene brings the old opera up to date,
for a solitary gunboat jerks a painful way across
an open-sea backcloth, and fires a single signal
salute. The chorus is fit for anything,
whereas the ballet might be of marionettes,
worked with bits of string’. The chorus is worth
going to see on its own. In the impressive scene of
the waking of fat Henri’s ancestors, the manage-
ment might improve matters by painting a little
dingy rust on the immaculate armor. All the
dead-and-gone ancestors shine like a silversmith’s
warehouse or a bride’s new kitchen.

As a Fleet-week attraction, Bill Anderson
produced “Robbery Under Arms” at Melbourne
King’s, last Saturday night. On this occasion,
the process of whitewashing Starlight and his
gang for public consumption has at least the
merit of effective scenic backing. The racecourse
scene in Act 11., and the rain scene (with real and
material wet) in Act IV., are alike considerable
features ; while the sticking-up incident, intro-
ducing a six-horsed coach of palpable antiquity,
gives an impression of bigness and reality by the
extent of the stage-space that is called into use.
Beside those things, the tangled and silly narra-
tive-even the incomparable chivalry of Starlight
in his war-dress of red shirt and black mask—isjbut
poudre de riz. Starlight, of course, has the lady-
like perfection of manner of an expert manicurist.
It is a characteristic of Starlight to be impossible
in that tremendously genteel fashion which is so
much “over the limit.” In truth, shooting him
appears to amount to deieide ! As for the rest,
the death of Jim Marston ; the escape of Dick ;
the love-makings of the chief misdemeanants
and their donahs; the relentless inanity of
Troopers Maginnis and O’Hara—all occur amid
the yell that signifieth admiration. George Cross
plays Starlight as a sort of armed Sunday-school
teacher, and is aided and abetted in felony by
Laurence Dunbar, as Dick Marston; and by
Walter Dalgleish, as Jim ditto. Max Clifton
makes a fairly convincing Warrigal, while the con-
versation of the two troopers aforementioned is the
overflow from Bert Bailey and Temple Harrison.
The Misses Duggan and Langridge are Starlight’s
and Dick’s donahs respectively; while “Flash
Kate ” gets the more or less studious attention of
Miss Ada Guildford. Take it altogether, Ander-
son’s “Robbery under Arms ” may be accepted as
the best performance thus far of a jerry-built
drama, which, in its verdant youth, was said to
waft the scent of wattle-blossom across the foot-
lights.

Last Saturday afternoon, at the King’s,
the flickergraph showed, for the first time in Mel-
bourne, how Billiam Squires was walloped by
Thomas Burns on 24th ult., and will continue to
do so twice daily (at 12 noon and at 3 p.m.) until
further notice.

A good many weeks back—seven or eight
—“The Red Mill” was referred to in this publi-
cation as a bright, irresponsible variety entertain-
ment which had just then commenced to shake its
legs at the Royal in Sydney. The fact that it
continued to agitate its limbs in Sydney until
last week amounts almost to a guarantee of a long
and wild career for “Theßed Mill” at Melbourne
Princess’s. It came to Melbourne with the Fleet,
and proceeded at once to demonstrate that “a
Dutch musical play ” is not to be judged by its
title. If anyone expected a melodrama of gory
interest, or a biographic presentment of the latest
thing in prize-fights, he was entitled to get his
money returned on application. All the same, he
would not be likely to want his money back.
There are not less than nine reasons why the
Dutch musical play is a matter for public satisfac-
tion. Firstly, it is amusing. The other eight
reasons will be lightly touched upon in a future
issue.

“Mrs. Lee’s Lodgers,” which re-intro-
duced Miss Florence Baines at Melbourne Bijou
last Saturday night, is charitably described as a
farce. It is indeed an indifferent sort of frolic, and
would be, but for the presence of Miss Baines,
the merest prattle in a tomb. Proceedings
open inauspieiously with the warble of four
maidens and of two gentlemen who look
something like bar-tenders. Apparently the
sextet are theatrical relics, residing, through
lack of convertible assets, within the flavorless
precincts of Mrs. Lee’s hash-foundry. Mrs. Lee,
it transpires, is herself already in the maw of the
bailiff, who lumbers upon the scene in the person
of an unedifying Hebrew. This creature has,
however, consented to secrete his identity in the
official toggery of a “boots,” while the stone-
broke hash-queen regains her financial equilibrium.
All her hopes of recovering her balance are
centred in the arrangement of a marriage between
Dr. Staines and a lady-lodger, Miss Swift, who is
unaccountably swollen with funds. If this exhil-
arating scheme should prove successful, then Mrs.
Lee will be entitled to a share of the loot. Mean-
time, a hint of azure is introduced by the arrival
of a lady and gentleman who unnecessarily declare
themselves to ba “ cousins”—when their order for
oysters and stout,” plus their expressive eye-
aetion, proclaim another relationship. It is dis-
covered that the lady is not quite divorced, that
the gentleman is the “platonic third,” and that
the husband is in pursuit. After their appearance
in the hash-emporium, things get twisted and
disorganised. Staines, the would-be husband of
the heiress, remains inexplicably absent, and since
the Lee lady must have a marriage of some de-
scription, she enters into a conspiracy. Getting
the simpering Miss Swift off the premises by a
bogus message, she herself bursts forth in spacious
male attire, and, with the connivance of the co-re.
aforesaid, takes the chief part in a sham marriage
with the re., what time the re.’s husband turns
up to act as the best man. The rest is
explanation and National Anthem. Except for
Miss Baines, who sings and acts with breezy
energy, the entertainment is not distinguished by
superior talent. Indeed, the diversions pro-
dded by the gargantuan capers of the Hebrew,
and by a mechanical staircase which precipitates
unwary folk to the bottom—not to mention a 20-
minutes interval between the two acts —produces
the effect of a streak of story, loaded with “ busi-
ness ” and numerous allusions to Adolphus Bent
just to give it bulk. It is not, on the wholp, apiece
calculated to arouse enthusiasm ; and its French
aroma, suggested by the view of three bedroom
interiors, is perfectly obvious without the needless
intimation on the programme.
i Majesty’s the odd story of “The
1 hief ’ —the thief who would a-wooing go—got a
respectful hearing from large and fairly intelligent
audiences last week. It is just now making an
impression upon crowds which probably are even
larger and rather less intelligent. An inopportune
laugh, or a burst of applause where silence would
be better, is not calculated to deepen the illusion
of a performance which wants all possible sym-
pathy from folks in front; Of these, indeed, a
large minority would more easily enter into the
heroine s feelings if she were to prance around and
tear her hair. There was at least one night last
week when the occasional gentle cough that de-
notes the half-vacant mind distracted one’s atten-
ticm from the dialogue of the bedroom scene.
Offenders will please accept this intimation that
intervals are provided for persons suffering from
troublesome throats. Moreover, cough-drops are
cheap. When the Fleet and the Agricultural Show
have passed away, Melbourne’s resident popula-
tion will have a chance to give a calm decision on
the case of “ The Thief.” From the comparative
point of view, it appears somewhat as an experi-
ment in artistic under-acting, because some good
dramas have been over-acted at the same house,
and many awful dramas at other houses have
within the last ten years made the judicious groan.
Miss Margaret Anglin never talks in italics, or
poses in inverted commas. George Titheradge is
sometimes theatrical in his most subdued manner-
isms, and Henry Kolker is less easy in his part
than the old actor. But the “star” lady does all
things naturally. If she leaves a little to be
desired it is when her repose tends to inertness,
and she does hardly anything at all.
** * *
A notable virtue in the music of the
“Kilties,” coming after the “Besses,” is
the comparative moderation of its brassi-
ln such numbers as the overture
to Tannhauser,” the difference between an un-
compromisingly brass band and a combination of
brass and wood wind-instruments is all in favor
of the “ Kilties.” They can’t rival the organ tone
of the English crowd, yet they give a pleasing
entertainment, apart from the variety items of
the programme. One gets about the last word in
fecotch reel dancing from the Johnstone quar-
tette ; also, the self-satisfied head of the clan is an
amazing bagpiper in so far that he produces an un-
questionable tune. The noises appertaining to
the air are almost as bad as the wickedest noises
of a common or amateur champion performer on
Scotland s accursed national instrument, but
Johnstone manages to reveal his purpose all the
time. Last week, the “ Kilties ” had the concert
platform at Melbourne Exhibition Building, and
this week they are in strong evidence elsewhere.

Princes Court, Melbourne, which had
been drenched with silence and inertia for a con-
siderable period, resumed active business last
Saturday night. This time it owes its revival to
the interposition of Wirth Bros., who have some
strong side-lines in circuses and wild animal
amusements. All the old trivialities the
chute, the skating rink, the diving tank, and so
forth—have been retained, and one or two new
ones have been added. A gentleman with
a formidable brow and a somewhat superior
demeanor now limns colored posters on a
raised platform; while to the west of the
chute, accommodation for the performances of
animals, trained in little trickeries, has been
erected. On baturday night Carl Hagenbeck put
a gentleman lion and some lady lions, a bear, a
dog, and various sundries through an interesting
series of evolutions, though the gentle-
man lion seemed rather displeased with
the environment or the company. He sat
on a stool and breathed hard at the bear.
Ilket and Jenny, a lady and gent attired in tights
of an opulent canary tint, are a good show. His
cleverest and most picturesque item is to balance
himself on his hands which are clasping the top-
rungs of two small ladders (one to each hand),
while from his clenched teeth is suspended a
bicycle, upon which his fair partner pedals
furiously.

Under the present Fleet circumstances, it
seems almost a waste of breath to mention that
the Rickards programme at Melbourne .Opera
House is being submitted to an excited populace
twice daily; 2.30 and 8 p.m. are the times
when the curtain goes up. At the same two
periods of every day, West’s Pictures come to
light in the Olympia building. A Fancy Dress
Carnival, on Friday night, is the impending event
oil the Glaeiarium bill, and a number of things
are to happen at the Town Hall prior to the
arrival of the Welsh Male Choir, whose united
warble can be heard in the distance.
One of Wirths’ Circus elephants worked up a new
“ turn ” for himself the other day. In the special train
going west from Toowoomba (Q.), Jumbo, who occupied
an LC. waggon with a mate, screwed off all thenutsfrom
the pins which fastened the heavy door. He didn’t then
push the door out, as a mere dull, bad elephant would *
instead, the joker left it hanging, so that it might fall
nicely on top of anybody who came fooling around those
quarters. When his trick was discovered before the joke
came off, Jumbo was horribly annoyed, and tried hard to
drive back the attendants who wanted to replace the nuts
LES CLOCHES.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
There stands an ancient castle on the summit of a
hill,
Near a tuneful fishing village, widely known as
Corneville.
And the bells are ringing gaily,
Ans the miser and the bailie
Are appearing as of yore upon the Melbourne
Royal bill,
For there’s money in “ Les Cloches a lot of
money in it still.
There s a marquis, you remember, who returns to
claim his own.
He s the seigneur of that castle, whence his ances-
tor has flown ;
He is told the place is haunted,
But his spirit is undaunted,
So he marches on that castle ; true he marches not
alone ;
He leads a trembling chorus—he’s the leading
baritone.
Not the ghost that they suspectred do the villagers
behold ;
The spook is Miser Gaspard, clutching madly at
his gold.
Thus the timid are enlightened ;
But the poor old man is frightened,
His mind goes off its hinges, and his lips turn
white and cold
When he hears the bells a-ringing as the legend
had foretold.
There’s 'another skinny Gobo, and a bailie red
and fat,
And Germaine, the rightful heiress, in a pretty
picture hat;
And Grenicheux, of course he
Spoons Miss Serpolette the Saucy—
The minx who makes us wonder what the mischief
she is at,
When she bids delighted johnnies “ Look at
this ! ” and “ Look at that ! ”
The ding-dong Bells of Corneville are ringing out
again,
And Serpolette is strutting in the plumage of
Germaine.
For the years, that travelled slower,
When the hardened theatre-goer
First heard those merry jingles he must sigh and
sigh in vain,
The music brings new pleasure—and a passing
twinge of pain.

AT POVERTY POINT.
O. K.” : All the famous musical artists who visit Mel-
bourne seem fated to appear sooner or later “ in conjunc-
tion with an orchestra," and it is almost invariably Mar-
shall Hall who waves a stick at the lamentable conjunc-
tion. Paderewski, Carreno, Marie Hall and Kubelik gave
opportunities for the much-belauded Conservatorium
professor to share their advertisement, and in every in-
stance the jubilations of Marshall Hall’s pupils failed to
persuade me that the orchestra was at all worthy of the
soloist. Perhaps the best is done that can be done under
the circumstances, for the orchestra is more or less a
‘ scratch ” team hastily rehearsed together, and many of
the individual members (notably in the recent Kubelik
case) have been young amateurs. But the best is not
nearly good enough. The pretentious “ would-if-it-
could ” performance is never so satisfactory as the per-
formances that the visiting artist gives without the
support” of the blessed orchestra. And the people
ought to be told this truth, seeing that they never get it
from the musical critics of the dailies.
“ J.R.”: Someone asked Admiral Sperry what was the
American National Anthem—whether it was “ Yankee
Hoodie or the “Star Spangled Banner.” It was rather
a stupid question, but the history of the two is interesting.
Yankee Doodle ” was an adaptation of an old Cavalier
song of the I7th century, by a musical surgeon of Brad-
dock s army—the army which was destroyed in trying to
take Fort Duquesne from the French. The idea was to
ridicule the rather clownish provincial militia and
volunteers ; hut the tune, being a good livelj' ohe to march
to, caught on, and became a favorite with the people
it was meant to ridicule, and has continued so ever since
—like the “ British Grenadiers,” the words of which are
about equally absurd. It was after the British repulse
with heavy loss before Baltimore, when their General,
Boss, was killed, that the “Star Spangled Banner ” was
written by Keys, who was at the time a prisoner on board
the British warship Minden, and witnessed the bombard-
ment of Fort M’Henry. In fact, it is said that he wrote
the song under fire. The song was at once recognised as
the expression of the national sentiment of the people of
the States, which, under the stress of an inevitable de-
fensive war, had ceased to be a mere bundle of half-
independent commonwealths.
Ada Reeve, who had some matrimonial experiences of
her own, was lately asked for her learned opinion on the
question “Why is marriage becoming unpopular?”—
which query, by the way, embodies a .delusion that has
been popular since the rosy dawn of civilisation. Ada
replied: “Speaking superficially, I should say it is
because the men are not bold enough, and the girls are
too particular.” Girls should take to heart this moral
drawn from their sister’s stage experience : “ Don’t be too
particular.” Then, ,with increased boldness on the men’s
part, the popularity of marriage will be assured.
The club-swinging mania has pushed its way to the
front again in Maoriland, the latest culprit being a boy
known as Gordon Weir, 15 years of age, who, on August
15, at Christchurch, chased the “juvenile record ” (what-
ever that might be) with two junks of kauri, weighing
2Jlb. He did it for 18 hours, and succeeded in knocking
the prey on the head. Whether the aforesaid “ juvenile
record ” existed or is only a myth no one seems to know,
but Weir’s admirers say it existed, and that their boy has
shattered it, and that they will back him against the
universe to whirl timber without ceasing, provided his
opponent is under 15 years. No one but a few people of
no importance care a rap whether clubs are twirled for
18 hours or six weeks. Such feats are valueless, and any-
one who starts to produce monotony of that sort should
be hurried to the nearest asylum. There is quite enough
monotony in life already.
Melbourne’s present feeling towards Shakspearian
comedy will probably be tested at Her Majesty’s when
“The Thief ” has run its course. Miss Margaret Anglin
and Henry Kolker are to appear anon as Katherine and
Petruchio in “The Taming of the Shrew,” which is usually
played nowadays with a liberal modification of the Bard’s
original scheme.
“ The Freak” : “ Prince Chap ” Roberts is the most eco-
nomical royalty of my acquaintance. He wears a double-
breasted blue serge suit in Act 1., and in Act 11. (three
years later !) he is still wearing the same suit. Most of
the princes I consort with change their entire outfit
every four hours. Either this Chap royalty is utterly in-
different to appearances or he goes in for Australian
serge. ,
From Melb. Age of Aug. 22 :
“JONESCU.—On the Ist July, at Predeal,
Rumania, Anton Vincent Jonescu, dearly beloved
husband of Syria (nbe Lamonte), of 21 Loughboro-
road, Brixton, London, S.W. R.I.P.
The Bulletin remembers Syria Lamonte as a chic little
actress with a rhythmical stage name. Her name in
private life was unmusical, not to say awkward ; and
when she begins to take notice again it is to be hoped she
will choose someone easily pronounced, say Smithto or
Brownif.
The forthcoming appearance of Miss Katherine Good-
son at Melbourne Town Hall (on September 12) should be
more interesting to the musical world from the fact that
later in the month a recital will be given at the same hall
by Miss Rita Hope. Miss Goodson, who brings an English
reputation as a pianiste, and will have the assistance of a
Marshall Hall orchestra on that account, W'as a pupil of
Leschetizky at Vienna. Miss Rita Hope, now returning
to her native Melbourne after three years’ absence, was
also a pupil of Leschetizky, and, assuming that rumor has
spoken truth of her, the reception she gets from-local
musical people will go to show w'hether it is possible
for an Australian pianiste to be a prophetess in her own
country. All the nice things said of the visiting English
lady by foreign critics will receive due advertisement,
doubtless, so it seems only a fair thing to quote some
complimentary remarks on the Australian girl from a let-
ter written a while ago to the Mayor of Geelong by a
Melbourne musician in Vienna. He wrote : “There is a
Miss Hope here, a very fine pianiste, who has been study-
ing with Leschetizky. She is indeed a splendid young
player, and is returning to Melbourne shortly. At her
recent concert in London, the critics were loud in their
praises, and she is sure to be a great success wherever
she plays.”
The matrimonial story of Clara Merivale’s husband (it
came to a sudden, abortive end in Melbourne Divorce
Court last week) was an interesting reminder of a long-
ago theatrical management which failed. The petitioner,
Meyers, found the money for the production of “ Poor
Jonathan” at Melbourne Opera House, and his wife,
Clara Meri vale, figured as manageress and prima donna
of the show. At the end of the first week the opera
might have been appropriately re-christened “Poor Clara.”
Yet it was a fairly good thing in its way : a German
opera—Americanised—with a strain of quaint originality
in it. Leumane, a former tenor of the Williamson Opera
Co., and colleague of Miss Merivale, was cast for the name
part, while Snazelle had the well-fitting character of an
opera impresario. Snazelle, by the way, is just back
again in Melbourne as a member of the Meynell-Gunn
syndicate’s National Opera Co.
Janies Brown Atholwood, actor, who lately did an un-
fortunate spell in gaol for bigamy (though it was not a
very clear case of bigamy, and when the Law tossed up,
the penny might as well have come down one way
as the other) was recently hauled up at Sydney
Water Bobby Court for unpaid maintenance money.
He explained that he couldn’t pay ; he was
an unemployed actor, and to all intents and
purposes hadn’t a cent. Yet Atholwood is something
of a genius on the stage, and he never yet acted a part
which he didn’t act well. Apparently the only reason
why he is unemployed is that he has been in
gaol on a rather confused charge of bigamy.
Any number of the heroes staged by J. C.
Williamson and Anderson and the Rupert Clarke syndi-
cate have also been in gaol, and in the dramas out
of which these gentlemen make their money, the hero
generally gets a bigger salary after he comes out of gaol
than before he went in. Unless logic is quite dead, these
firms ought to rush Atholwood with engagements at in-
creased salary. If it isn’t good enough to engage the
actor who has had the misfortune to be locked-up, it
shouldn’t be good enough to make money out of the hero
who has been locked-up.
Miss Stella Gastelle, the prima-donna-soubrette of the
Wren-Musgrove opera co., made her first hit as Alesia,
the doll-girl, in “La Poupee.” She played the character
through a long provincial tour in England, and was sub-
sequently called to London to play it some more. Aus-
tralia will see her for the first time as Serpolette in “ Les
Cloches,” one of the very best of comic opera parts for a
singer who is also a vivacious actress.

SOCIETY
Of all the clods that had been clodded at
the aged head of Bent during the Fleet pre-
liminaries, the largest allotment came from the
Melbourne city fathers. Their grievance against
Adolphus was on account of his dilatoriness in
removing, as promised, the Homes for the Aged
and Infirm on St. Kilda-road. The buildings,
which are as drab and unpleasing as a wet Friday,
sit on one corner of what are now the Queen Vic-
toria Gardens, formerly the centre of Yarra bank
oratory. They are almost surrounded by an
ocean of verdure, and, as the municipal dads
pointed out, would furnish to the visiting Yankees
an unnecessary architectural blot on what was
otherwise a grinning landscape. All the same, it
was useless reminding Bent about the matter,
when the proximity of the visitors and a crowd of
pleading deadheads were making his existence a
burden. They should have spoken to Adolphus
when Parliament was sitting. Then he had no-
thing to do.
* * * *
A quaint episode connected with the
Fleet’s visit to Melbourne was the march of the
Ballarat Naval Cadets to the city on the Yarra.
The brigade is 60 strong ; but as the Defence De-
partment declines to consider Ballarat a seaport,
and won’t officially recognise this brigade of in-
land marines, the Railway Commissioners refused
the travelling concessions afforded to other cadets.
So the plucky boys decided to do a five days’ march.
It was a cheerful picnic, and the youngsters had a
gay old time, being helped on their way by heaps
of friends and sympathisers. Meantime, the atti-
tude of the Defence Department wants looking at.
If the alleged seaport of Ballarat is capable of
turning out properly-trained naval cadets, they
should be cordially encouraged; if not, they
should be wiped out at once, and transformed
into military cadets. Nobody has any business
training his own private cadets, and turning what
ought to be a useful prospective defence force into
a joke.

Even if the uniform wasn’t different, you
could tell a British man-o’-war from an Uncle
Sam’s Jacky nearly every time. John’s man
seems to be nearly always liable to apoplexy ;
Sam’s seems to have a frightful time with his
liver. John’s lot mostly wears a pipe in its full
red face ; Sam’s is sometimes chewing, but oftener
is decorated with a see-gar or a cigarette. And
while John’s man has his arm around the girl as
soon as the girl looks as though she wouldn’t
mind, Sam’s sallow-face stands off in a respectful
manner that must have been horribly trying to
Little Liz. Liz had got used to the British navy’s
sudden way of showing its affection.

“ P.” sees a floating jim-jam :
I went round per boot the other night to Macquarie
Point (Sydney), to revive aflickering intellect by the glow
of the harbor illuminations. Towards the opposite shore
the stalwart hulls of Uncle Sam’s ironclads were pencilled
in lines of fire upon the ebon canvas of the sloping rear-
ground. Above them, the electric-bulbed yards on
the masts gleamed through the night—suggest-
ing mammoth golden crosses upraised on colossal
jewelled altars in a Cathedral of Dreams. The
incense of the outer ocean came fragrantly on the soft
nor’-easter. The stars rocked peacefully in the
gentle harbor swell. Fort Denison leaned a rounded,
glowing bosom against the sky. Behind, the city droned
happily, and somewhere afar off a band sang mysteriously
that indeed the time was good.
Standing there, taking it all in, thinking it all beautiful
and peaceful and friendlv-like, my tired brain dozed for
a moment. Then I nearly toppled into the harbor with
sudden fright. Where formerly had been darkness
there had appeared an Awful Thing—a huge, ungainly
Coffin, brass-nailed and clieaply-black, like the shell of a
pauper giant. I shivered, and turned to a bystanding
British sailor for enlightenment.
“Oh, man of the Sea,” cried I, “ thou hast seen many
things in the vasty deep and heard of many more. Tell
me, then, the whyness of yon grim, ghastly, eerie Thing.
Do I see Visions? Have I a Rat? Is it a Warning from
the Unseen ? Unfold to me the meaning of the Enormous
Casket of the Mouldering Dead ’mid this scene of light.”
The sailor eyed me contemptuously. “ Casket be
damned ! ” said he. “ That’s the Pa’hf’l just been ’lumi-
nated.”
It was indeed the Flagship of the Australian squadron,
but its lines of electric bulbs along the deck, down the
cutwater and stern, and along the water-line made such a
perfect simulacrum of a brass-nailed bone-box that I had
to fly like blazes from the scene. But, after all, had the
thing a meaning ?

Star-spangled Jackies are not the only
naval men who have fallen victims to the blan-
dishments of Sydney society. Rear and even
front-rank Admirals have, after a few days’ enter-
tainment, tried to desert for the sake of the
syrens of Potts and Darling Points. De Winton
tells of a French admiral, whose small fleet lay in
Farm Cove in the long ago. He became so
enraptured with the local beauties that he wrote
out his resignation and declared he would spend
the rest of his life with the Sydney girls. Major
de Winton and other old soldiers endeavored to
calm his ardor, and, taking him into the open plot
in the middle of the old barrack grounds (now
Wynyard Square), talked earnestly to him about
all he was surrendering—his glory and his pro-
spects and his cocked hat, and the rest. The
sermon, however, only aggravated the admiral —
and yelling “D my cockit hat,” he kicked
the brain decoration over the barrack wall.

This winter has been a trying time for the
person with the tarry paws who fights the deep
for a living with a lot of bad language and a
limited quantity of canvas and hemp. The steam-
ship greaser, on the rare occasions when he puts
his nose above decks, has only got to cling on
while he spits over the side, but the
sodden object on the lurching windjammer,
with his whiskers crusted with salt, is
the sport of the waves and the joke of the
vasty deep all the time. Instead of having
11,000 horse-power and a screw as big as
a suburban town-hall to push him through
the gale, he has only his hands and toes
and a set of flapping sails wherewith to
belt the unreasonable oceans and earn
his totally inadequate wages. The old-
time mariner had a healthy scorn for the
smoky steamboat, but to-day, as he wal-
lows in the trough and staggers dizzily on
the surge, he turns a bloodshot eye of
envy on the upstanding liner that cuts the
oncoming seas in two with a knife-like
bow, and kicks them astern with its
mighty propeller. He watches it moodily
for a minute until its wind-blown smoke
comes rolling down in a thin mist across
the watery hollows and hills, and then he
roars angrily for someone to haul up the
hooker’s braces, or do something else that
sounds impertinent and seems altogether
useless. Half-a-dozen big sail-driven craft
have lately put back to Australian ports in
a more or less crippled condition, after
battling unsuccessfully with the thing that
is marked Pacific on the map, and that
leaps on our national doorstep. The be-
seeching blue light and the soaring
rocket have hollered for assistance pretty
frequently off our csoasts this winter,
and, after reading the storie related by
the battered salts in the shelter of the
various harbors, this paper has come to
the conclusion that the sea is a very wet
place indeed.
Two deaths from cocaine poisoning have
happened in Adelaide lately, the drug in both
cases being pumped in by dentists, and numerous
narrow escapes are also talked about; so nowa-
nights a decaying molar has to tug extra hard
if it wants to land Adelaide in the operating chair.
Four or five years ago the S. Australian Parlia-
ment talked at much length about protecting the
public from the unskilful fang-remover ; and when
Parliament passed an Act. the public reckoned that
it was safe at last. Now, however, having to
account for these two almost simultaneous
comses. the Dental Board announces that the
Act which was supposed to protect the public
isn’t really of much account; in fact, in many
cases it gives the public a ton of confidence in a
person who doesn’t deserve more than about
2cwt. Anybody who had been in the habit of
hauling teeth in 1901 or previously is entitled to
be registered as a tooth-d rugger under the Act of
1904; wherefore some people who only pulled
teeth by stealth in 1901, and blushed when the
fang found publicity, have npw blossomed out into
brass plates, from which they blare the fact that
the Dental Board has set its seal upon them under
the law made and provided, etc.
After staggering about on the ocean like a
drunken thing for over four weeks, the Union
Company’s broken-down Hawea was picked up
by the Rakanoa, of the same line, and reached
Sydney in safety. But the Aeon, the big Howard
Smith steamer from ’Frisco, is still seriously over-
due, and the re-insurances are rising ominously.
The Aeon left ’Frisco on July 5, and has not
arrived yet at Samoa, and is 60 days out. lb®
whole run to Sydney should have taken 30 days.
Right in its track lies Sydney Island, and on
August 12 the big steamer Willesden, from Puget
Sound, passed that way, and observed what the
captain took for signals of distress. But he did
not stop to inquire, as he was afraid the lossjJ , a
day might cause his coal to run short. lhj s
seems a most inexcusable excuse, seeing that his
ship had a huge timber cargo on board and could
easily have made up a few hours’ steam with wood
fuel. It is not known when another steamer
will pass Sydney Island, and a long period of
misery for the castaways there, and of anxiety
for many folk ashore, may be the result of the
economy practised by the noble skipper of the
Willesden.

“ Briner ” : Aboard one of the largest
English warships on the Australian station, I
asked a sailor whether they had a library. 1 Only
these,” he replied contemptuously, pointing to a
lot of tracts. Every ship of every kind ought to
have a library. Of course there is the old English
notion on a man-o’-war that the common people
ought not to be allowed to read. Caliban says to
Stephano, “ Burn Prospero’s books. Without
them he will only be the same as us. ’ Marconi
expects that in a few years the whole ocean will
be covered with a network of communication.
This leads me to think of the sailor’s vote. Every
sailor will one day have a vote for somewhere.
When an election is on the votes of seamen and
passengers will come in by marconigrain. Al-
ready sailors’ votes for Britain, America, France,
Germany, etc., could easily be collected on the
Atlantic.

“MEN’S j&
OUTFITTERS,”
309-311 George Street, Sydney.
The amours of Elder Mackie, as a Mel-
bourne daily described the adventures that
threaten to land that good man in worse trouble,
illustrate the folly of trying to live the life of a
gay Lothario on a pound a week or thereabouts.
According to the narrative of the police, Mackie
casually ignored his wife and his 11-year-old son,
and gained the budding affections of no less than
three different damsels. Their affections .sprouted
so freely that they bestowed on him many gifts of
jewellery and the like ; and when Polly gave him
a trifle the cute elder promptly passed it on as his
gift to Molly, while Molly’s little keepsake went
along to Dolly. This was all very well for a
while, but a time came when Polly and Molly and
Dolly all insisted on a ceremony with a minister
and a ring in it; and as Mackie couldn’t very con-
veniently keep four wives on his paltry screw, he
decided to skip to Sydney. Unfortunately,
he omitted to notify his wife of his de-
parture; hence a warrant for desertion, the
discovery of the alleged Polly and Molly
and Dolly, his apprehension, and now a
sentence of nine months’ gaol to top off with.
Mackie’s church—the Latter Day Saints—paid
him the munificent “ screw ” of £4 7s. 6d. per
month, and as this continued to be paid to his
wife aftey his departure, and will so continue till
he is deprived of his eldership, the fact occurs that
though he left his wife he didn’t leave her with-
out means of subsistence ; so the Pull Court is to
inquire whether Mackie really deserted his lawful
spouse or merely removed himself from the atten-
tions of the three deluded damsels, and intended
to send for his wife later on. Anyhow, the lady
declines to have any more to do with him, and
the three damsels present the cold shoulder ; also
his billet of shepherd is about to depart, and the
job he caught in Sydney has vanished. So Mackie
is in the soup, even if, on appeal, it shouldn’t turn
out to be quite such thick soup as it looked.
ART AND MART.
VERY GREAT ARTIST INDEED (to admiring youny
person): “If I have genius it is for cows.
The critics say that my cows stand alone.
There is nothing like them in Australia. But
unfortunately I cannot yet rid of them.
There is no demand for cows.”
ADMIRING YOUNG PERSON (impulsively): "Oh,
I’ll speak to pa. Pa can help you. Pa’s a
salesman at the cattle-market, you know.”
The Queensland postal authorities state
with pardonable pride that a letter addressed
“Mrs. Smith, the bush, Queensland,” has been
correctly delivered. The lady wrote to the
Cold Country and mentioned casually that she
was living in the Queensland bush, and either
forgot to state any other address or else the old
folks lost it. Anyway, they must have thought
Queensland was about the same size as Rutland-
shire, and they sent the reply along. So the
inquiry office put out its feelers and inquired from
the travelling post offices and the mailmen who
run ’twixt Normanton, Thargomindah and the
Setting Sun ; and shortly a mailman on the Outer
Rim beyond Cloncurry remembered that a lady
named Smith had asked for a letter that should
have reached her a long time back but forEederal
mismanagement, and the document was safely
delivered.
Apparently another of Premier Bent’s
little arrangements for improving his constituency
has gone adrift, or got bogged, or something. A
while back he announced that he had bought the
“improvements” on Brighton Beach known as
Kenny’s baths for £350, and had sold them to
Henry Butler, late of Sargood, Butler and Nicol,
one of his constituents, at the same figure.
Butler was going to hand the alleged baths over
to a committee of Brighton residents, also at the
same figure, and the committee was to expend
several thousands of pounds in building new
baths and generally improving the scenery there-
abouts. Now something has gone smash, and
Butler won’t buy the aged baths, and the residents
refuse to be interested therein, and Bent has
resumed the land held by the Kenny family, and
wants them to remove their washery. So
Brighton looks at present as though it won’t have
any baths next summer—and some of it wants
washing badly.

While I softly creep on.
Humility is not one of the normal healthy
Yank’s vices. The following—the “Aitiurkan
Burrd is a soliloquy the majority ,of him was
wont to warble during the Spanish-American

The biggest, bestest, championest boss cock of the lot.
When I scratch gravel, mind your eyes !
When my flappers move air, listen for thunder !
They talk of their cocky Cervera—he can sit in his
Moro Castle, but he can’t sit on me !
When I excavate terra firrria, get your goggles ready !
When I shake ray feathers, look for trouble !
I am always looking for trouble and won’t be happy
Till I get it.
I have twisted the Lion’s tail and made him roar 1
I have now got the Dago by the lug and when
I let go he won’t be fit for a respectable funeral.
I am the Amurrrkan Eeee-a-gle ! ! !

Melbourne’s new central railway station is
likely to cost a lot more than the £93,478 for which
contractor Rodger undertook to build it. The
contract was signed on September 23, 1905, and
was to have been completed by November, 1907 ;
v but as, at the rate of progress made, it wouldn’t
have been finished till about the end of 1910,
•Boss Tait determined the contract on
L - August 15, and set out to finish the job him-
self. No‘w Rodger hits back and says that
the Department never knew what it
wanted, and changed its presumed mind
so often that he could never tell where
he was. He says that the 17 original
plans on which he tendered have all been
altered, that he only got possession of
the eastern end of the station last May—
seven months after the building was sup-
posed to be finished—that plans
for offices, etc., have been cut
out and class rooms, gymnasia,
I etc., substituted; that brick
archways have had to be pulled
down and replaced by iron;
that foreign cement had to be
substituted for the Australian
article, in defiance of the tender
conditions ; and that he has
had to wait months for fresh
plans. Also he intends to ask
the Law to decide the dispute.
Now the question arises why, if
the Department is capable of
erecting half the station, it
couldn’t have undertaken the whole contract
from the start, and so have saved a lot of time
and money, besides contractor Rodgers’ profits,
a ton of prospective law Costs, and a heap of pub-
lic inconvenience and unpleasantness.

Brisbane is doing a hard think. Recently
the Queensland National Society, to encourage an
improved milk supply in the city, offered a prize
for competition by vendors, the samples to be
taken from the delivery carts whenever the
committee might choose to drop down upon them.
At first only two entered out of some dozens, but
a little persuasion raised the competitors to six.
Presumably these six vendors would be somewhat
on their guard; yet the committee made the
startling, discovery that only one man’s samples
were pure. The others were all more or
less watered. And the Government Bac-
teriologist found that the vendors had not
been using pure water even, for, in addition to a
fair population of deleterious microbes which
every unclean dairy produces, there were many
water bacilli present to swell the aggressive army
which the milkmen’s customers were offered.
These revelations have made even the Courier
sit up, and ask questions. But then it promptly
tailed off into foolish calculations, instead of
chopping up its joss, Private Enterprise, and
whooping for municipal milk distribution.
The frequency of deaths under chloroform
in Melbourne of recent times has led a local doctor
to suspect the quality of the anaesthetic. Accord-
ing' to him, chloroform, in excessive temperatures,
is liable to decomposition, and, indeed, may be-
come of dubious freshness when unduly exposed
to the light. Over-ripe chloroform has the habit
of generating carbon monoxide, which is poison-
ous, colorless, and odorless, besides being alarm-
ingly sudden in effect. Thus the collapses of
anaesthetised patients, which have been so com-
mon, may have been due to the presence of the
monoxide in chloroform, which had been rendered
over-age by the unusual heat of last summer. The
medico suggests the immediate analysis of all
available stocks of the drug, and when you con-
sider how frequently the chloroform death helps
the evening paper to its penny, the suggestion
seems worth trying.

The alleged discovery of a combine in the
Melbourne confectionery trade encourages the
wild hope that a conspiracy of butchers will
be brought to light anon. Confectionery,
after all is said and done, plays only a minor
partin the building up of the national consti-
tution, whereas meat, at its present price in
Melbourne, is a matter for domestic alarm.
Householders chew their steak meditatively
these times. Those who haven’t yet lessened,
their consumption of animal food are counting
the cost of their dyspepsia, and breathing futile
curses over the festive board. Even the
young man who delivers joints and “small
orders ” at the back door suspects the exist-
ence of a combine somewhere, and advises
the oppressed consumers to go on strike,
but his exact knowledge of the situa-
tion is limited to the fact that he
makes nothing extra for himself. The
rise in the price of meat has not
benefited any sort of worker thus
far. Neither is the person who
grows the live stock thought to be
getting sinfully rich at public ex-
pense. But between him and the
cold dead carcases of the sheep
and bulioek there are the inevit-
able middlemen, among whom
the mysteries of meat-trading
are carefully preserved. And
now that the Commonwealth
Government is demanding facts
and figures from the purveyors of
barley-sugar and butterscotch, the
other long arm of the law—if it has
a pair of ’em—might as well, or
better, be stretched out in the
direction of them who control the
supply of tender loin chops. The
decapitation of a master butcher
on his own block would be gener-
ally recognised as a practical result
of the Anti-Trust Act.
Mrs. Annie Besant should be sorry to hear
that a Mahatma of considerable eminence is now
doing four months in an English gaol. His name
is Agamya Guru, and ‘his counsel reverently
described him as a great Sanskrit scholar, who is
high priest of his sacred order. By long years of
study and meditation he has arrived at a state of
communion with the Eternal Spirit of the Uni-
verse. He 'is now entitled to consider himself
“as much a god as the Eternal Spirit.” In India
he is above even the rules of caste, and wherever
he goes the people receive him and worship him.
Since he first reached England in 1903 he has
visited America, and there he proved his spiritu-
ality to a committee of doctors by causing his
heart to stop beating for a time. In fact,
Agamya Guru is about as big a thing
in Mahatmas as Mrs. Besant’s fellow-citizens
are likely to meet, yet his theosophy is
tainted with original sin. He advertised for a
lady shorthand writer and typewriter, but when
two girls in turn came to him in answer to the ad.
he merely wanted them to “worship him all day
long, and be happy with the other five disciples in
the house.” Also he started to instruct them in a
form of Mahatma worship, which was ultimately
reduced to a charge of common assault. The
London beak let Agamya off with a light sen-
tenceinconsideration of the fact that there might be
religious sanction for his conduct in India, though
it was too advanced as yet for the more worldly
countries. Agamya Guru is seemingly a back-
slider, or else there is something wrong with Mrs.
Besant’s conception of the Mahatma doctrines.
And seeing that a Buddhist god of the first degree
can’t backslide, it is up to Mrs. B. to explain what
is the whole.duty of Woman to a brown divinity.

A sequel to the case of Grace Lee and the
ex-police inspector (referred to in last week’s
“ Plain English ”) was reported in the Melbourne
papers on the same day that The Bulletin came
to light. The Victorian Crown Law Department
disposed of the very ugly scandal by prosecuting
Grace Lee for perjury; and she, after pleading
“Not guilty,” said she was guilty, whereupon
Justice a’Beckett sent her to prison for three
months. Which, considering that the perjury
whereof she was convicted had, by her previous
confession, been prompted by another man, must
be regarded as a lame conclusion. The woman
made three charges: first, the charge of theft
against her paramour; second the charge of
perjury against herself in withdrawing the accusa-
tion against her paramour; and, third, the
charge against a private inquiry agent of having
persuaded her to bring the accusation which she
afterwards withdrew. One sentence of three
months doesn’t clear up that complication, by a
long way.
NOT ENOUGH DEPARTURE.
At the request of Lady Northcote a whole holiday was
granted to the children attending the Victorian State
schools on the occasion of her leaving the State.
VICTORIAN KID: “ Wot a pity she don't leave us
every week.”
“ Mate ” writes
The loss of the A.U.S. Oo.’s Mareeba ilustrates the
absolute necessity of a chart-rbom on the bridge of all
ships, in spite of Mr. Justice O’Connor’s failure'to see it
in the Arbitration case between the M. S. Guild and the
shipowners.
The second mate only needed to lay off the bearing of
the Nobby’s from (say) one mile off Stockton Beach, and
he would have known his limit of safety. Had the chart
been within easy reach, and the skipper not asleep along-
side it, he would have done this as a matter of course.
When the master sleeps in the chart-room it is nearly
as bad as being without a chart. No mate likes' to dis-
turb the skipper if he can get along without, and in every
case when a mate got the ship ashore he thought lie
could get along without.
Often a mate would like to make sure, but he knows
he’li wake the old man. As the old man has given the
course himself, he’ll think it presumption on his officer’s
part, so the officer lets things slide. Ninety-nine times
it’s all right, but the hundredth time the officer’s in the
soup.
The average deep-water ship takes all kinds of precau-
tions when in with the land. One thing always done on
deep-sea ships I’ve been in is for each officer to plot the
position of the vessel on the chart at the end of his watch.
His relief verifies this (by' cross-bearings, if possible), and
lays off the course for his own watch before taking
charge. This is done on some of our coasters, and should
be done on all. Coupled with written night orders from
the master—stating what he has allowed for current and
leeway, if any—it makes it almost impossible for a mate
to put the ship ashore. If she does go ashore, that fact
indicates clearly who was in fault.
GETTING HER OWN BACK.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
It is not sufficient if woman be persuaded to abandon
bird plumes; the massacre of furred animals is abomina-
tion, and we are appealing to her better nature to give up
the wearing of furs. For my part, I hold that the woman
who loves to smother herself with the hair of animals is
not properly civilised.— Melbourne daily paper cor-
respondent.
They say that woman lags behind,
In civilising processes ;
That man, her master, more resigned
To all our primal losses is.
He’s ceased to miss the useful tail,
Worn off in sitting decently,
But woman’s more inclined to rail—
She lost her’s far more recently.
Which fact gives us to understand
The substitute she wears for it,
The long trail on her garment, and
The patent love she bears for it.
Once she was clad in lovely hair —
A most attractive frock it was.
In ages this began to wear ;
You’ll understand the shock it was.
When man had got his wool off quite,
The ladies clung to patches still,
And silky tufts could expedite
The fixing up of matches still.
But evolution had its way—
The fact is irrefutable ;
The fig-leaf came. E’en in its day
’Twas not considered suitable.
Eve still regrets she had to peel
The set of furs she grew herself.
To-day she robs the fox and seal
To (as it were) renew herself.

The WILD CAT
COLUMN
The Maoriland State Fire Insurance Office,
which began regular business early in January, 1905 (the
deficit up to then represents preliminary expenses):—
Ex- Added to De-
Dec., Revenue. Claims, penses. Reserves. licit.
1904 £1026 £1026
ReseYves.
1905 .. £13,136 £2,418 6738 £3980 295*4
1906 .. 20,991 10,312 7215 3464 6418
1907 .. 23,302 12,701 8355 2246 8664
In the foregoing all preliminary charges incurred in
1904-5 are treated as ordinary expenses ; on the other
hand, the provision made to cover unexpired risks is
reckoned in with the reserves. Of the funds as at
December 31 last (the issue of the office’s report is de-
layed absurdly) £7732 is to cover unexpired risks.
This leaves true reserves of £932. In other words,
the offioe has established itself and put by £9)52
as the result of three years’ business. The reserves
are not very much; on the other hand, there were
probably £2OOO or more of expenses in tihe first 12 or 18
months which have to be incurred again. The
general manager evidently doesn’.t think the reserves are
big enough, and he complains that the Maoriland fire-
insurance rates are top low. The fact, of is'that,
in order to\knock opt the S,tate Fire Office, the com-
peting ,c*os. pulled down their rates hand over fist as soon
as it appeared on the scene. IMt were to disappear, no
doubt the rates would be bumped up to recoup the cos.
for their temporary losses. Maoriland’s only firm hope of
enjoying reasonable rates is to maintain the State
office; and the sooner the State makes if plain that
it doesn’t intend to go out of the business, the sooner
rates are lively to be revised, if revision is really neces-
sary. The State office clearly doesn’t want to squeeze
the cos. into unprofitable business ; it is obviously
quite ready to consider a slightly increased tariff ; so if
the cos. persist in the present “cut” tariff, it is their
own fault.
The loss rate is too high; 54.5 p.c. Qf the net
premiums was absorbed in paying claims last year, and
49.1 p.c. in the previous year. With marine business,
where the expenses are usually light, that loss rate might
pass ; but in an ordinaryyear it is much too heavy for
an office that does fire business only. It allows a quite
inadequate lay-by for the disaster that hi'ts practically
every fire office once or twice in a generation. The actual
losses are probably no greater in number than they should
be ; there is not necessarily any fault in the selection of
risks. It may be simply that the premiums are too low.
An increase of 10 per cent, in the premium rates would
reduce the loss rate for last yea,r to 49 per cent. —and even
that is quite high enough. The expenses last year were
35 r 8 per cent, of the premiums. An increase in the
premium rate wmuld of course reduce the expense rate
too.
As. for the policy-holders’ security, no other
office can offer so much. The capital actually raised
was only £2OOO, but the Stajte has guaranteed
and authorised £100,000; and behind that again are
all the resources of the State. Of course the
people can never get the benefits they ought to set from
this and other forms of State insurance so long as the
State merely joins in the horribly expensive hustle with
Private Enterprise for the business that is available. If
there were half-a-dozen people competing with the State
for the letter-carrying business, and if* the whole seven
had to maintain an army of canvassers and collectors, and
send out tons of shrieking literature, and pay for acres of
advts., a penny post would be an utter impossibility.
The marvellously cheap services that the State renders
are only rendered at that rate because, having a mono-
poly, it can lop off extraneous expenses; and until the
same thing happens in connection with insurance—fire,
accident and life—the public won’t derive the full benefit
of universal co-operation.

The profit and loss account shpws a profit of £163,188 ;
but £lB,OOO has been appropriated to pay a bonus to staff
—this bank’s way of making up (more or less) for the per-
centage reduction which it imposed on the staff in the
days when the boom burst, which reduction, by the way,
has never since been wiped out, in spite of the recent
great prosperity. Of the dividend shown above for the last
two years 4 per cent, is paid ,gs a bonys, which probably
means that the direetprs don’t hold out 1 any sort qf pro-
mise to pay more than 10 per cent, under ordinary condi-
tions. It is.,very good, no doubt, of the bqpk to pay a bonus
to the staff as well as to itself ; Ijjit it wouldn’t relish the
situation half as much if the 10 per cent, dividend really
only amounted to nine per cent., through 10 per cent, of
the capital having been struck off away back in the
’nineties.
The half-year compares with its fellow of the

There has been a substantial increase in the advances.
Very large land transactions had taken place during the
previous two or three years, and no doubt many of the
purchasers have been calling for more assistance on
account of the shrinkage in wool values. The drought
in Victoria has also had the same effect there.
Especially in the early part of last year a good
deal of stress was laid on the'fact that most of the banks
had got rid of practically all their pastoral properties.
No doubt the new holders brought a certain amount of
cash into the business ; but they have had to be financed
very largely by other banks. The Amalgamated Bank
lent Brown £lOO,OOO to buy Molten Plains station from
the Disrupted Bank for £150,000. The Disrupted Bank
smiled, because it reckoned that it would never get more
than £125,000 for Molten Plains. Now the wool market has
gone back on Brown, who has had to get another £20,000 ;
so the Amalgamated has £120,000 at risk already. Of
course, Brown is still in possession ; but, if we had a bad
year or tw T o, Brown’s advances might easily creep up to
£160,000, by which time the Amalgamated would reckon
it time to do something. There are people who have
taken quite a new view of bank investments during the
last few years because the banks are supposed
to have got rid of their pastoral properties. But the un-
loading has not been a very real thing ; they have got rid
of some, but they have laid the foundations for acquiring
others during this boom in land values. If they had lent
all that they intend to lend, they might not make any
losses ; but it takes a very stiff-necked bank to shut down
on clients in that way. And so, unless the future is to be
quiite different from the past, banks haven’t left their
pastoral losses behind them merely because they mostly
got out of their squattages during this boom.
In spite of the increase in advances, the Union’s
cash position is very strong. It has over 44 per cent, of
its debts in a liquid form, so that apparently the limit of
its profit-earning hasn’t been reached by a good bit—it
could make £2,060,000 more advances, and still hold 35
per cent, of its deposits, etc., in liquid form. Its
reserves are over 1J million ; and it probably also jias
internal reserves. Anyway, 10 years ago the premises,
etc., in Australasia were valued at £612,632 ; and though
they have been largely added to, they now stand at
only £475,391. Larsre amounts have also been written
off ‘investments (Consols, etc.). These internal reserves
make it easier for the Union to show one of the highest
earnings rates among Australian banks ; on capital and
visible reserves combined last half-year’s profits were at
the rate of £lO 12s. 3d. per cent.

For many years the paid capital was £190,000. With the
big increase of deposits and other liabilities the directors
18 months or so back prudently decided to get in more
capital; so now £250,000 has been paid up. This still
leaves a liability of £7 IQs. each on the 100,000 shares.

the last few years, and especially during the last year

The outstanding feature of the past twelve-months is the
growth of advances—so big a growth that, under ordi-
nary circumstances, it would cause some concern. Two
things might be responsible. First, it might be due to
the co. rushing matters ; but it has never had the reputa-
tion of being that sort of 00% More likely, the squatters
and such like of S. Aus. and the West Darling haven’t
had so good a time lately. The season has been pretty
good, but the fall in the wool market must have “ rattled ”
many of them ; and a quantity of the clip has been held
off the market in the hope of a recovery, so that the
growers have had to ask for more accommodation. So
far as this co. is concerned, the satisfactory factin connec-
tion with the increased advances is that the co. hasn’t itself
borrowed more money to make them. Part of the extra
£305,115 has come from the new capital; the other part
has come from what 12 months ago was the very heavy
holding of liquid assets. Moreover, the co. has adopted
such a conservative policy in the matter of dividends
during the recent very good times that £95,436 has been
added to the reserves in four years. Therefore, in spite
of the large increase of advances, and consequently of
risks, £1 of shareholders’ funds has to protect £2 16s. of
advances, whereas two years ago the £1 had to protect
£2 17s. of advances. The co. is also helped by the severe
writing-down that has been practised. Goodwill (£40,855)
has been written off entirely ; and of the £132,259 spent
on land, premises and plant, £53,504 has been written off.
Though it is setting a business a pretty big contract to
pay 10 per cent. div. forthwith on a third more capital,
still this co., on account of its rapid accumulation of re-
serves, is in a singularly favorable position to tackle the
big job. Whether it will succeed in making a habit of it
depends upon the seasons and the wool market—and
both are treacherous cards to go nap on. Yet in these
latter days of mixed farming many of the wool cos.’
clients have a second string to their bow ; and owing to
the use of fertilisers, drills, etc., the agricultural string is
a much more reliable piece of cord than it was.

This co. was formed in 1902 to carry on the old-established
business of the Toohey brothers, and there was a tremen-
dous rush for shares, even though no less than £55,000
was being paid for the goodwill. There had,; evidently
been a bad miscalculation somewhere ; so by 1906 the £1
shares were down to 11s. At this point it was decided to
have an overhaul; and the representatives of the two
Toohey estates made things easier by surrendering 50,000
of the 375,000 shares they had received, on condition that
the whole of the remaining 500,000 shares were written
down from 20s. to 16s. Capital was thus reduced by
£150,000, and the reserve fund (£18,000) also disappeared.
Goodwill was written down, as shown above, to
£22,500. In the table, this item—a paper asset —
is disregarded; the directors also evidently intend
to formally w;ipe it out, as they have established
a reserve fund against it, though they aremot building it
up very fast. The profits in the foregoing comparison
are stated net; £2500 is, as a rule, written off each half-
year. Whether that is the only provision for wear and
tear and depreciation is not clear. Possibly something is
charged direct to profit and loss; but there is no men-
tion of it. The items are, as a matter of fact, so lumped
that it is practically impossible to tell what the real posi-
tion is. The accounts published six months ago disclosed
a large increase in the profits ; and there was nothing to
explain how it happened—it might have arisen partly
from the recovery of debts previously written off as bad.
The present accounts cover the “off” term —the
winter, when the pint isn’t so alluring ; and, though the
profit is so much less chan the previous term’s, yet there
has been a steady, though not large, improvement
compared with recent winter half-years. The gross
profits on brewings and sales, after providing
for bad debts, have moved like this : 1905,
£33,134 ; 1906, £31,629 ; 1907, £36,507 ; 1908, £41,480.
That looks all right; but, on the other hand, expenses are
creeping up steadily (£27,481 in 1905 to £31,763 in 1908);
and rents and interest, Which were £B6BB in the first half
of 1905, have gone back steadily to £6760 for the past half-
year. Obviously in connection with a co. whose principal
assets consist of three lumped items aggregating over
half-a-million, a great cleal depends upon what is written
off profits to cover depreciation, etc. Sundry debtors
stand for £105,348 ; brewery, hotel, and other premises,
plant, etc., represent £338,178; stocks, £67,444. If only
per cent, more is written off these in one half-year than
in’another, there is a difference of £2500 in the disclosed
profits. One can therefore only tell from the general
drift of things how the co. is shaping; and so far one
certainly can’t tell very much. Buying Tooheys under
these conditions, and unless one has more information
than the published accounts give, is a good deal like
buying 16 bananas in a bag. They may be very good
bananas ; but one has to risk it. And then there is the
general brewery risk arising out of the uncertainty as to
what the public will do with the drink business in the
future.

This co.’s reserves consist of redemption fund (£9432),
depreciation fund (£19,141), reserve for renewals and con-
tingencies (£9154), and undivided profit (£2073). The
profit and loss account says that the profits are stated
“ net, after providing for renewals, etc.” “ Etc.” is verv
elastic ; evidently in this case it doesn’t mean wear and
tear. Apparently the co. pays for ordinary renewals out
of current revenue, and charges them up to working
expenses; but the depreciation and-other reserves will
have to provide for any big renewals that may become
necessary in tlie future. In other words, wear and tear
isn’t wholly provided for ; hence the profits are not
actually net, and the reserves are more or less nominal
how much more and how much less it is impossible to say.
This certainly was the policy formerly adopted by the
co., with the result that in 1904 no less than
£44,909 had to be written off tfie reserves, besides
£73,384 off capital. The half-year has shown only
moderate returns. Partly owing to drought, partly
owing to the fact that Kidman and his little haye
collared.so big a proportion of the'fat cattle in the No’rth,
and partly owing to the work of the Sydney Meat Pre-
serving Co., high prices have ruled for stock in Sydney,
and the cow and the lamb have been exported in very
small quantities ; consequently this co.’s cold storage
spaces have been very empty. Like nearly every other
concern that to a great extent hitchps its fortunes on to
the pastoral industry, the results are as erratic as the
climate upon which the industry main)y depends. The
cash position of the co. has much improved during the
past few fat years :

But this surplus cannot be regarded as accumulated
profit; as mentioned above, the reserves no doubt have
to provide for the big renewals that are gradually
coming neardr. In other words, more or less of this
money merely represents worn-out capital. What
one really wants to know is how much true profit
was made in excess of the dividend ; that is to say, how
much of the amount put by was necessary to cover wear
and tear. Wear and tear in this sort of business is no
doubt very heavy ; yet it has to be remembered that
renewals so far have been charged up to working ex-
penses, and that amounts to something in the way of a
provision for depreciation apart from the formal reserves.
It is an uncertain business ; but it looks as though the
last few years have given it a good lift that should help it
through the next bad times. There are 183,460 shares,
paid to 10s., and liable for 2s.

The capital stands at £150,000, having been douhjed in
1904 by transference of reserves. The reserves shown
above are described as nominal because steamships, etc.,
are taken in at cost, and £30,000 of the reserves is a de-
preciation fund. Another £12,500 is insurance fund.
Neither of these are wholly true reserves. Repairs and
overhauls are, however, charged up to working expenses ;
so that the depreciation fund has only to provide for
future replacements and anything special in the way of
renewals, Since profit and loss is, not charged with de-
preciation (apart from cost of repairs), the true profit is
less than is shown above, because something must be
written off to provide for the general decay which
isn’t covered by current repairs. The excess of
profits over dividends for the past yegr was
£15,891, and that is over 8 per cent, of the whole
property item—steamers, freeholds, worlds, etc. ; and as
8 per cent, is no doubt much more than enough to
cover depreciation and provide for insurance (so far as
theco. doesitsown insuring), the true profits appear to
have been very considerably ip excess of the dividends.
The cash position is fairly strong : the co. owes £42,344
(£20,663 of it received on deposit), and it has liquid assets,
including book-debts, but excluding stores, totalling
£53,824. The ,co. is, however, having a new passeng-er
steamer built, and had only paid £4907 on account at
the end of the half-year. Partly to provide for this addi-
tion, anew issue of £20,000 of capital was recently made
—the shares went to existing shareholders—but this
operation is not shown in the present accounts.

been post-mortemed, this fund has not been included
with the reserves, and the additions to it have not been
reckoned in with the profits. Now, however, as various
smaller reserves have been transferred to this insurance
fund, the table has been recast, and the fund has been
throughout included with the reserves. Profit and loss
account is charged with depreciation ; but what amount
of the profit is put aside for this purpose is one of the
numerous things that are not mentioned. Twelve
months ago ship properties stood at £41,868. Since then
the Lady Carrington ferry-boat has been added, and the
same item now' stands at £45,762. Apparently, there-
fore, the amount of profit set aside during the year to
cover depreciation has been £3894 less than the cost of the
Lady Carrington. In the past six months the ship item has
been reduced by £lBOO ; that, therefore, is the amount of
undisclosed profit set aside to cover the six months’
wear and tear. Meantime, repairs and renewals have
been charged to working expenses. This, moreover, was
the “off” season of the year ; nevertheless the provision
was equal to 8 per cent, per annum of the book value of
the fleet, and that ought to be quite adequate for the
purpose. Besides ship property the co. holds freeholds,
£32,723 —mostly recreation grounds, upon which the
return so far must be very small ; and unearned
increment can’t be relied upon, even in con-
nection with these foreshores, to quite the same
extent as it used to be before unimproved laijd
taxes began to sllow up. Mainly on account of these land
purchases fairly heavy liabilities have been incurred.
Six months ago the total was £36,209 ; but £9193 of new
capital has been got in during the half-year, and the
liabilities have been reduced to £27,346. Against that
there are, among other things, “ secured debtors, £9300 ”
—apparently all or partly on account of sales of portions
of the estates. The new capital was raised by the issue of
the remaining 10,000 authorised shares ; this brings the
total up to 50,000. For some years down to 1905 the paid
capital was £16,420; and on the early issues after that
£8555 was received in premiums. On account of this
great increase of capital, the record of the co. prior to
1905 is practically no guide to the future prospects. Ten
per cent, is no doubt a big div. to be pai'd by a co. with so
large a sum sunk in freeholds which for the moment earn
very little ; bat it must be noted that, on account of the
premium capital, the 10 per cent, is really only equal to
about 8J per cent, on the amount actually received from
the shareholders.

The co. has now a capital of £lOO,OOO ; the real estate
lem on the other side stands at £102,000. Property and
plant represent more than the whole of the capital and
reserves. To provide working capital, therefore, the co.
had to raise money on mortgage over the premises. In
1902, wh§n a revaluation was made, £12,500 was written
off capital, and £5200 off reserves. At that time the
mortgage stood at £69,750. Siribe then the following
comparison shows how things have moved :
July, July, Jan., July,

Mortgage debt .. £69,500 £67,500 £65,500 £64,500

Book debts .. .. 20,616 20,795 23,893 25,442
Other debts ” have thus increased just about as fast as
the mortgage has been reduced ; but this added debt is
apparently trading debt, carrying no interest. In the
half-year to July, 1900, the interest bill was £1872 ; for
the past half-year it was £1672. The co. is, on the other
hand, weighted by the size of the property item, and that
handicap will continue till the trade is very much larger.
The stock is necessarily taken in at valuation ; so the
profit shown is really a matter of estimate only. If the
estimated shrinkage in value through depreciation is too
small, the profit is over-stated; and vice versa. Furni-
ture, fittings, and plant stand at £11,998 ; that is a
matter of estimate too, and the figures look large. The
reserves have grown substantially during the last few
years ; but it has to be noted that the co. owes nearly
£85,000, so the reserves have to protect not only the
assets which represent the capital, but also the assets
which represent this £85,000.

The reserves consist of formal reserves £50,000 (including
dividend reserve £5000), debenture redemption jund
£4OOO, interest reserve £l9lO, and undivided profit £1252.
The co. has been making very fine progress of late. In
the past five years, besides writing off £15,019 against de-
preciation, it- has put by £42,043 of reserves, while the
dividends have only totalled £2?,805. Thus vvhile it has
paid an average dividend of 5 per cent, during the five
years, its average net annual profit (provided enough has
been written off to cover depreciation) has been about 12£
percent. The gross, profits have in the five years been,
as shown above, £57,062 in excess of the dividends. This
has not, however, gone in reducing the co.’s debts : five
years ago they amounted to £106,240 ; they are now
£113,319. (This includes £50,000 of debentures in both
cases.) Thus £57,062 of surplus revenue and!£7o79 of
public money has in five years been put into the business:
over £20,000 of it has gone in stock (now £105,239), and
£17,000 is in book debts ; while the whole of the £15,019 of
profits written off, and over £6OOO besides, has been
put into plant. ’Jjie risks of the business have,
therefore, been considerably increased; The stock is
taken at valuation ; if it has been over-valued
the profits have been over-stated. In any business whose
assets are largely merchandise stock, that is liable to hap-
pen ; the investor can have no effective check—he practi-
tically has to rely on the management. That, along with
the heavy liabilites (including £73,000 of mortgages and
mortgage debentures), and the £l2 10s. per share liability,
is the doubtful feature about an otherwise very alluring
set of figures. There are 8898 shares of £25 each, paid, as
just hinted, to £l2 10s. ; and there are 3102 shares
authorised but unissued.

So in the three years £144,250 has been paid in divs. on a
capital of £l4O j)00; and a large part of that capital was
merely paper. Besides the £b(\ve-mentioned reserves,
£3OOO has been set aside during the past half-year to pro-
vide for possible reclamations on account of over-pay-
ments for concentrates (the price is settled some time after
deliver} 1 )- As shown above, £12,619 has been written off
in the six months. This is vyhat has really been
done : on mine and mill £9164 has been spent
during the term, and £7920 has been written
off; and £4699 has been spent on the new shaft,
and the whole of it has been written off. Whether
this £12,619 which has been written off ought to be
treated in the first place as profit is a matter of opinion ;
it is largelv merely adding certain figures on to lop them
off again. ‘ But it has this effect: when such work as
shaft-sinking is not charged direct to working account,
the mining cost per ton of ore is made to look less ; so
when the working costs of two mines are compared it is
always necessary to find out whether the two adopt the
same' policy with regard to shaft-sinking and similar ex-
penditure.

North Broken Hill is cock-a-whoop because for
the past six months it actually shows more profit than
the great Broken HilJ Prop. Things have improved
tremendously at the North. Years ago Tiie Bulletin
put forward a theory that the Broken Hill lode was a
saddle, with wide-spread flaps—a sort of squashed V
turned upside down. The apex was at the B. H. Prop. ,
the ends of the arms at the South and the -North.
Developments are supporting that theory. The B. H.
Prop, was very rich at and near the surface , now, at
depth, things are sick, especially in the north end.
On the other hand, neither South nor North ever had

much prosperity till they reached the comparatively deep
levels. The North was actually thrown up once, and the
South came very near it. But, in spite of its present
bigger profit?/, the North is a small mine compared with
the B. H. Prop. Last half-year, the North treated
65,633 tons of ore ; the B. H. Prop, raised 273,557 tons.
It is one thing to tear out 273,557 tons and quite another
to get 65,633 tons. The B. H. Prop, estimates its ore
reserves at 3,000,000 tons above 1400 ft.; so the half-year’s
output was equal to 1-llth of the total. The North
reckons it has 1,100,000 tons, so its output was equal to
only l-17th of the total. The B. H. Prop, prac-
tically can do no picking and choosing ; it just
has to get ore where it can. The North isn’t
pushed like that; and its ore is, moreover, of much
better milling quality. So between fine recoveries
and low costs it scores temporarily over its great neigh-
bor, the B. H. Prop. But put £1 per ton on to lead,
and then while the North would only benefit about
£7BOO in a half-year on present output, the B. H. Prop,
would put on £27,500. That is where the two differ.

The British Broken Hill is still waiting, appar-
ently for either an improvement in metal values or a
reduction in wages. Everything is ready for a start, and
the mine has never before been so well situated for mak-
ing a good run. Since the stopes and mill were closed
down at the end of last year fresh ore bodies have been
opened up, and the mo’ney spent on development has
been well laid out. The drives that are at pre-
sent being carried from Thompson to Howell
shaft, at the 600 ft. and 700 ft. levels respectively,
will eventually take their place in the scheme for working
the big ore body discovered at the 800 ft. level. Very
little is yet known concerning that ore body, except in a
general way that it is big and rich and forms a connecting
link between the old main workings and the little-
developed Block 16 end of the mine. It is also believed
to have an eastern underlie, evidence of this being
apparent in the east and west crosscuts, where what
were supposed to be the foot wall and hanging wall were
cut.
* * * *
Optimistic shareholders in the Broken ]Jill
Junction are telling themselves that the fine ore
body struck at the 800 ft. level of the British
will pass into their mine through King’s section.
For the sake of the Junction’s future, it is to be hoped
the ore-body will do as desired. But, first, there are one
or two obstacles to be overcome. From Thompson shaft,
where the British got out of the lode, to King’s section of
the Junction is a distance of 600 ft. If the lode is pitch-
ing north, as Junction shareholders hope it is, then since
it was 800 ft. down in the mine at Thompson’s, at what
depth will it be found at King’s? Considerably over
1000 ft. anyway. Also, it would require to have a western
underlie to get into Junction ground at all, and up to the
present the evidence obtainable indicates an eastern
underlie.
* * * *
Extensions recently made at the B. H. South
Blocks mill may save the situation. A little while ago
the reconstruction of the co. was an imminent proba-
bility ; now the shadow on the wall is much fainter. This
mill has been doing very good work of late, and, given a
fair metal market, there is a better chance for the mine
now than there ever was before. The ore body at the
440 ft. level is going down splendidly, and if appearances
are not a liar (they often are in mining), a crosscut put
out west at a deeper level ought to locate a bigger make
of ore than has yet been met in the property.

Queen Bee, Cobar district (N.S.W.), did not
get very satisfactory developments in the winze below
No. 4 ; and things are not much better in the north drive
at No. 5, which showed strings of yellow sulphide ore.
This, however, should improve as they drive further
north, judging by the experience gained in the upper
levels. A lateral body was discovered in the western
crosscut about 68ft. from the shaft, with sft. of 8 per
cent. ore. There are good hopes of this ore body ; it lies
below the big gossan formation in the higher levels.
Copper mines are mostly erratic customers ; but, anyhow,
the Queen Bee has maintained a relatively large produc-
tion of copper, while other copper shows have shut down
by the dozen ; and that suggests that, under more favor-
able market conditions, the co. should make big profits—
if it has any ore left by that time.
* * * •*
A meeting of shareholders in Nyrnagee Copper,
Ltd., was to have been held in London on July 29 to
complete the provisional agreement for the purchase of
Crowl Creek and Shuttleton. Consulting-engineer
Kendall, of Great Gobar, has made a report on the amalga-
mation, and favors it. “ Crowl Creek and Shuttleton,”
he says, “ have only a small output, but they yield a class
of ore which is complementary to that obtained at
Nymagee. Crowl Creek ore is acidic, and the Nyrnagee ore
largely basic.” The perfect mixture would be 390 tons of
Nymagee and 70 tons of Crowl Creek ore; but Crowl
Creek ore couldn’t stand the cost of transit unless two
tons were concentrated down to one ton, and that would
mean a daily output of ,140 tons, which is beyond Crowl
Creek at present. The future of the scheme, therefore,
depends largely upon further development at Crowl
Creek. Nymagee itself has been idle most of this year.
The mine was owned for a long while by the Cobar
Syndicate; but, when the Great Cobar, Ltd., took over
the big pronerty, Nymagee was acquired by a separate
co., consisting largely of the people who also form the
Lloyd Go. A new hauling and rock drill plant was put in,
and a good deal of development Work done ; but after
running out 306 tons of copper, work was stopped in
December, as it ivasn’t profitable. Kendall estimates the
ore blocked out in Nymagee at about 110,000 tons, worth
2j per cent, at least ; and he also estimates that, with the
mines worked together, copper should be landed in
Sydney at £46 per ton.
Ajax, Uaylesford (Vic.), is trembling on the
bank of the Styx, as three months will see all the payable
ore in sight beaten out. Crushing now gives £lOOO per
month profit, and the grab-all crowd wanted to work out
the last bit of payable dirt, cut up the profits, and let the
future go hang. This is Ballarat all over. The Bulletin
never did believe in the Ajax-Daylesford boom, because
the field had a record of 30 years of disappointment. But
it despises a system of mining' finance that involves
spending the last scrap of profit on divs., and then
shutting down without further sinking. Had the Ajax
done this the management ought to have been black-
listed. The mine record is—Capital provided, £9600 ;
dividends, £36,000. That is well on the way to £4 return
for each £1 spent. Fortunately the grab-all crowd had
not the face to push its policy, and so another lift is to go
down. As it is, the work is being approached in a miserly
spirit.

Micawber seems to have been the author of the
last report about the Bromley’s Reef (Vic.). Stone that
went underfoot was the best seen in the mine, the public
is told. This is a nasty trick of Nature ; but it is one that
keeps mining alive. Incidentally, it keeps the legal
manager alive also. Really, what is wanted in such cases
is a slab of truth showing the length of the shoot at the
level where it went underfoot, its average contents, and
what it cost to get. A bit of hard stuff like that would
tell whether the shoot was worth sinking for.

Victoria, Zeehan (Tas.), puts up a poor tally of
ore, and a fine record of call-paying for the past six
months. There is £34 on the one side and £2736 on the

ing, trying to strike the Spray lode at 300 ft. Shareholders
are plucky and have a chance, though Zeehan has never

Black Range (W.A.), Hans Irvine’s pet show,
was originally partly unloaded to the willing Western
district (Vic.) squattocracy, with Railway Commissioner
Tait in the rear. From the jump the co. has had it rich,
and some thank T. Robertson’s divining rod for it. But
Hans Irvine’s brains are more responsible. He is a canny
man, who not only generally knows a good thing when he
sees it, but also knows how to use it; so when he picks
up a likely claim he can get plenty of support. In that
way came also the float of the Black Range-Kohinoor, and
to-day a mysterious Murchison property, the Youanme,
is being tested. As this latter test has taken
longer than was expected, and as the vendor
has cut a slab off the price, which price has
never been allowed to leak out, it looks as if the
block were not the choice goods at first thought. Black
Range mine itself has put out 67,9040 z. from 42,698 tons.
No wonder the haughty Western District atmosphere per-
vades the Board room ! The co.’s best hits of late have
been good grade stone north of the break and at the
bottom levels. Seeing that the reef runs from 2ft. to
sft., there is every reason why a decent sink should be
done, instead of levels being put out at every 50ft.
Irvine, H. E. Rowe, and Robertson have just got back
from the mine, and, though they know more about wool
and wine, that doesn’t stop them from saying that better
divs. are to come. With Manager Ooupar behind them,
this may be taken as highly probable.

Ivanhoe (W.A.) has a solid development at
1820 ft. The crosscut at that point has proved that the
east lode, the backbone of the mine, assays 465. 3d. for a
width of 44ft., and gradually dips away from the Boulder
boundary. In the level above at 1669 ft. the lode was
28ft. wide; and, as a winze sunk nearly 130 ft. on the
underlay furnished £3 ore, the existence of a big tonnage
between those two points is assured. The Ivanhoe east
shoot is the longest and best on the field, and, along with
those in the adjoining Great Boulder and Golden Horse-
shoe mines, it will probably be producing" gold when all
the other ore bodies in the district have given out.

This is liow the Associated (W.A.) stood at the
end of last March. Assuming that the official estimate
is correct, and averaging all costs and London office pick-
ings at 30s. per ton (which is Is. 9d. less than last year),
the profit in sight is £288,524. Investments total
£127,740 ; shares and sundry investments (including 9813
Associated Northerns and 63 Mines Water Trust shares),
£7742 ; stores, £12,308; sundry debtors (almost entirely
made up of bullion), £19,056 ; cash at bank and in hand,
£17,361. Reckoning the co.’s liabilities at £7331, this
gives an apparent surplus of £465,409 in addition to what
the plant equipment, live stock, etc., might fetch if
auctioned. But as belief in estimates of “ profit in sight ”
has ruined almost as many men as wine, woman and the
slow nag put together, speculators had better look twice
before they jump to the conclusion that the Associated
has all this surplus up its sleeve. Past year’s operations
show a profit of £114,877 ; but as £64,185 is written off
for development, shaft-sinking, depreciation, etc., only
£50,692 remains. Add this to £16,697 brought forward
from the previous years, and you get an available balance
of £67,389. Dividends, along with dividend duty and
directors’ percentage, absorbed £65,388, leaving £2OOl to
be carried forward.
* * * *
After absorbing the balance of profits pre-
viously brought forward, Cosmopolitan (W.A.) made a
loss of £l4Ol on the operations of 1907. Tributors’
royalties annexed since then, however, show a surplus of
£1664 over expenditure. Every inducement is given to
tributors to unearth new shoots, and the co. lives in
hope of fresh discoveries which will eventually justify it
in turning the finders adrift and re-starting operations on
its own account. Mention is made in the report of the
big wad of scrip held in the Prentice and Southern Deep
Leads (Vic.), and announcement is made that a separate
co. is to be formed to work the Phcenix tin mine, Corn-
wall, and that Cosmopolitan and Hannan’s Proprietary
shareholders are to be given a preferential right to apply
for shares. With tin at the present price large profits
from this venture are predicted, but this prediction is too
stereotyped to soak in very deep.
The extension of the tribute system to several
properties previously lying loose around Kalgoorlie has
put a lot of money into the pockets of working miners.
Wells and party took a small fortune out of the Boulder
No. 1. Two claim-holders on the Chaffers lease have
begun to well line their purses after a month or two’s
labor, while several of the parties at work on some of the
other graves of Bull’s capital in the district are reported
to be doing well. As a result, some more derelicts are
being given a trial.

Havilah, the Melbourne-owned Black Range
(W.A.) show, made a profit of £4039 last half-year, of
which £2lOO was paid to shareholders ; this made the
total dividends to date £5250 on a capital of £42,000,
though only £18,250 cash was put up. The bank balances
on July 18 were £6960. The half-year’s mill returns were
B'oBdwt. ; from cyanide, 4'4ldwt. For the first half of
1907 the averages were 17'82 and B'62dwt. respectively ;
so there has been a serious shrinkage, mainly due to
the irregular and poor values at the bottom (210 ft.)
level. In places the lode is split up, apparently through
the influence of hard diorite, and it tails off into small
and unworkable quartz veins. On this account the pros-
pects are only very moderate.
To date over 2| millions sterling has been paid
to prospectors in Westralia for gold and tin recovered by
the State mills On the whole, the searcher after mineral
wealth is well looked after in the West. He is in some
cases provided with a turn-out; he can hold an area from
12 to 18 months without paying rent ; he gets a reward
lease if the discovery is a new one in a new district; and
if he finds something worth having, a water supply and
crushing facilities are provided him by the Government.
Later on, when he gets down and wants to scrap the
windlass for a steam winder, and to swap the bailing
bucket for a pump, the State again steps in and lends him
money to buy plant. Thus the way is paved for him to
become the owner and worker of his own mine.

The manager of Queensland Exploration, Clon-
curry (Q.), is so extraordinarily cautious in his forecast
of operations for the ensuing month that it makes one
wonder whether it is his way of breaking gently the news
of trouble ahead. Both output and grade are improving,
he says, “ but against this it is well to be prepared for a
breakdown, which may occur at any moment, although it
cannot be foreseen. ” Development work during July seems
to have been sacrificed to ore-raising in order to keep pace
with the smelters. The output shows an increase on the
previous month’s, but the grade of the 250 ft. ore body is
lower ; and, more serious still, the sulphur contents have
decreased. This looks like the cause of the uneasiness as
to the future. The figures for the month are—Rever-
beratory furnace, 358'6 tons ore and five tons of matte
for 28 tons copper; blast furnace, 1242'3 tons ore for 41
tons copper. This means a recovery from the bulk ore of
4'3 per cent. Development in the 250 ft. level has proved
the length of the caleite lode to be 74ft., and the com-
bined width of the calcite and sulphide lodes is 31ft.

The make of ore in the south-west drive at the
O.K.’s north lease (Q.) has now been proved for a distance
of 114 ft. ; and, unless the co. had extraordinarily good
luck in just hitting the spot, the half-mile between the
north shaft and the parent mine should help considerably
later on. The indications near the shaft were not a great
deal better than they are at several points south towards
the main workings, and future developments on this lease
and the O.K. Extended are worth watching. Just alittle
north of the O.K. north shaft is Anderson’s Surprise,
about which Abdul Wade recently threatened law. It
is said to have good ore at 100 ft., but is keeping
curiously dark on the matter. Latest reports tell of a
discovery about 25 miles north of 0.K., where a shaft is
down 14ft. on rich ore. It is a pity that the co. did not
get that tramway when it had the offer.

Charters Towers share-market is getting very
sensitive because the East Mexican is passing from mere
hopes to the period when dynamite blasting will prove
something. The next few weeks should disclose whether
the shoot of stone proved in the New Brilliant Freehold
exists in the higher levels. Perhaps the East Mexican
boundary may prove more than 90ft. above No. 7
level in the N. B. Freehold. No. 6 level from Mills’
United as it progresses into the East Mexican lease will
be watched with anxiety. Some good judges reckon that
No. 7 in Mills’ United was the best level—much better
than No. 6 or No. B—and they expect the same across the
boundary. In any case, East Mexican is at present essen-
tially a proposition that will take a lot of money to prove
and develop, and many changes may take place while that
work is in progress.

After crosscutting more than 700 ft. westward,
South Glanmire and Monkland, Gympie (Q.), has cut the
Inglewood reef. But it doesn’t mean much extra profit
at present, as a trial lot of 15 tons only gave Boz. gold.
This reef is in diorite country, and the gold is very fine
and evenly distributed. Gympie hasn’t much faith in
fine gold, but the hopes of black slate country overhead
has caused some buying at about half-a-crown. E.
Oriental and Glanmire, after a good crushing, was able to
pay a sixpenny dividend (£4000). Twelve months since
these shares were sold for about 6d.; they are now worth
(ex div.) about 7s. The crosscut at 2204 ft., which is only
50ft. below payable gold, has 12in. of quartz going down
very straight. The mine is keeping 40 head of stamps
going, and there is a lot of crushing stuff above 2154 ft.
level—quartz leaders intermixed with black slate. Speci-
mens are the mainstay of the mine.
The six months’ exemption granted to the mines
in thh Mt. Flora district, at the back of Mackay (Q.), has
about run out, and so far no arrangements have been
made to resume. There is no profit in sending the ore
away, and the only furnace available is a small reverb,
at Mt. Orange. Local people have been almost implored
to put up the few hundreds necessary to provide some-
thing more serviceable than the Mt. Orange toy, but they
are apparently all deaf at once.

The dispute at Oaks (Q.) between the reefers
and the diggers has not been finally settled yet, and the
uncertainty is preventing parties from going to much
expense in improving their claims. Wise’s reef is said to
be giving the owners £2O per man weekly, and the next
claim is on rich stone. The town is assuming a permanent
aspect.

The Lady Jane (Mungana mines, Q.) is sinking
a winze below the 320 ft. level, and is obtaining good
assays (29 per cent.) of lead and silver (10oz.). The co.’s
annual report is about due ; but it cannot be cheerful, in
spite of the 30,000 tons that have been sent to the fur-
naces. If last month’s results could be multiplied by 12,
things would look much better, no doubt ; for the pre-
sent output is over 1000 tons a week, and there have been
other changes. The Girofla, at 510 ft., has a friable lead
ore body, apparently big, though the size is unproved,
with good silver contents. There are 100 ft. of backs
above this level, and a narrow streak of rich copper-lead
carbonate ore has been sunk on from the upper level.
The Mungana mines are expensive to handle because of the
heavy water and the need of much timber. On the other
hand, there has been a decided improvement in ore ex-
traction and treatment since Chillagoe tackled the de-
sulphurisation problem. Treatment is, however, not
cheap by any means, and the working-out of the process
—crushing, roasting, converting in H-H pots, and finally
smelting in blast furnace—has been a hard fight.
Stannary Hills (N.Q.) is having a hard struggle
to pull through now that tin is back to a trifle over £130;
and the men who have had to make the financial arrange-
ments can’t have had a rosy time. A couple of months
hence, if something unpleasant doesn’t happen meantime,
the Ivanhoe mine may be giving enough “sweetening”
ore to put a different complexion on the returns. At the
bottom level there is a shoot 10ft. wide worth over 3 per
cent. ; but the cost of getting it is killing till the new
shaft is sunk ; and that work is now in progress. With
that done, and the improvements at the reduction works
completed, costs will come down and the grade may go
up. Yet the prospects are very uncertain. Even with
this Ivanhoe shoot the reserves will be small, and the
bodies are irregular ; and the tin market is an uncertain
beast.

E. E. Watson, the metallurgist who, for the
last few years of their life, had the impossible job
of running the Aldershot (Q.) smelters, and, after they
collapsed, was passed on to the almost equally impossible
job of running the Pinnacles mine (N.S.W.) for the
same crowd, has left for Europe ; and that’s about the
last link gone between Australia and a co. that made a
bad mess of things. The co.—it was practically one co.
that owned works and mine—never had half enough
money for its job, so it soon mortgaged itself to the
Rothschilds, and when it couldn’t pay the interest the
bailiff looked in. The Aldershot works were allowed to
go as a bad job ; but somebody else was found in London
to take over the debt on the Pinnacles mine, and later
on he had to take possession, and this second mortgagee
has been working the property for the past 18 months or
so. At least he dragged a large quantity of ore out.
Then metals slumped, and, as the Elmore process hadn’t
succeeded, he passed the show on to a syndicate, which
is understood to contemplate putting in a new mill. But,
first of all, the mine needs developing, and £lO,OOO isn't
a penny too much for that job.
As for the Aldershot works, nobody is likely to
touch them unless the State takes them over; and,
though they could no doubt be got very cheap, the ques-
tion is whether they are in the right place to be touched
at any price. Anyhow, negotiations will be opened up
pretty soon with 'the Government, if they haven’t been
opened already.

Tin averaged £lBO 17s. 6d. in 1906, £172 16s. sd.
in 1907, and it is about £133 now. The average 10 years
ago was £7l 4s. 7d. ; two years before that it was £59 9s.
The market is most erratic ; there is in it a tremendous
amount of gambling, not to mention “ interference with
the laws of supply and demand.” No forecast is therefore .
worth very much. Still, a few things can’t be overlooked.
Between 1889 and 1898 (both inclusive) the average never
reached £95 in any year. In the five years 1894 to 1898
the year’s average never got beyond £7l 4s. 7d. Yet in
the past 10 years £llB 12s. sd. is the lowest average
for any twelve months. The question is whether, in
view of probably changed conditions, we ought
to go back beyond 10 years. If not, then
obviously the old £6O and £7O quotations have
nothing to do with the case, tra, la 1 Conditions un-
questionably have changed. We can buy almost any-
thing in a tin these days. German consumption has
doubled in 18 years, and United States’ consumption has
doubled in 12 years. The Straits’ output meantime has
been little more than maintained. The total Straits
shipments in 1897 were 45,628 metric tons ; in 1906,
59,375 tons. Billiton sales in Holland and Java fell from
6180 to 1980 tons in the same years. All other production
amounts to comparatively little ; the Straits production
is more than 60 per cent, of the total. On these figures
it looks highly probable that the high tin quotations have
come to stay for a time—not the £2OO boom quotations ;
but anything over £125. They would no doubt go much
higher if there were not a considerable amount of de-
tinning done from scrap-metal nowadays.

The Sydney co. that was formed to pursue the
phantom “ Page millions ” to the other end of the earth,
decided on liquidation last week. After paying the
directors £2OO for their trouble, there will be 9s. in the £
for shareholders. Now another little co. is being pushed
off, mostly at liatoomba, in the interests of Morris, the
claimant, who doesn’t reckon that the Sydney co. pur-
sued the millions hard enough.

All philosophic works, and Holy Writ itself,
teem with warning of the uncertainty of life. Deaths by
natural causes have been pushed far down the years of
civilised life, but with the increase of that very civilisa-
tion the liability to accident has enormously increased.
The railway, the ferry, the tram, and the murderous
motor car inevitfably cause thousands of people to place
their lives and limbs in the hands of entire strangers, of
whose ability they can have absolutely no knowledge. It
would seem, therefore, to be only common-sense to guard
against the financial consequences of misadventure by
taking out an accident and sickness policy with the South
British Insurance Company Limited ; £5OO Death, £'3 per
week Accident and Sickness Compensation for £3 per
annum. Head Office for N.S.W.; 12 Bridge-street, Syd-

In the calculation of working costs m concen-
trating' mills and workshops, every small item should be
taken into consideration. It is the small and uncon-
sidered factors, involving waste of power, that make for
high working costs. The type of bearing employed has a
marked effect on the power consumed in overcoming
friction. Recent exhaustive tests emphasised the marked
superiority of the Hyatt Flexible Roller Bearings over all
other types of roller, sleeve, and other anti-friction
bearings. Under equal conditions the loss of power due
to friction in Hyatt Flexibles is 23 per cent, less than
with the best solid roller bearing, and 65 per cent, less
that with babbit metal journals. Messrs. W. and J.
Lempriere, 506 Little Collins Street, Melbourne, will be
glad to supply further information to those interested.*

After conducting exhaustive tests m the con-
centration of the ores at the Broken Hill South mine, the
manager, Mr. Wainwright, has finally decided to instal
the Wilflev type of table, modified in the direction best
adapted to his particular local requirements. The great
advantage with this type of table is that it admits of so
many slight variations which adapt it to meet all classes
of pulverised ores. Provided the pulp for treatment is
graded it can be used to treat all varieties of ore from
slimes up to coarse grades. When treating slimes and
lightly mineralised ores, care must be taken to have the
slope of the table accurate, and a fine, smooth dressing
surface beyond the feather edged diagonal termination of
the riffles. When treating coarsely ground ores or ores
heavily charged with mineral, as at the Broken Hill South,
the riffles or grooves can be carried further along the table
and in some instances right up to the concentrates dis-
charge end. Mr. Wainwright ordered six tables as an
experiment, with fewer riffles or grooves than customary,
and with some of them —the lower ones—carried to the
extreme end of the table. So successful has this type of
Wilfley table proved that he has ordered 50 more from
the Austral Otis Engineering Company. This same firm
has been placing several of the patent Callow Screens at
Broken Hill and elsewhere. This ingenious and simple
mechanism has solved the problem of grading prior to
concentration.* B>

ABORIGIN-
ALITIES
James P. Boucaut : In The Bulletin
(13/8/’08), “Poodgeregah ” says that he has “seen
scores of Arab stock handled, and of two stations
where there were Arab horses standing, 90 per
cent, of the stock were weedy and unsafe in the
legs. The sire in each case was a fine-looking
horse.” Ido not say that it is impossible to get
Arabs which may throw unsound stock, but
it is very rare. One of the most remarkable
features of the Arab is his hardness of bone, and the
quality of the stock described by your correspon-
dent leads me to express the opinion that the
alleged Arabs were not Arabs, but half-breds—or
less. Not one out of ten animals sold as Arabs in
Australia is really an Arab. That is notorious. I
venture respectfully to maintain that Harry Stock-
dale is perfectly right in affirming “ the incompar-
able soundness of the Arab’s legs and feet.” I had
a two-year-old pure Arab who broke his leg by get-
ting it wedged in a fence while playing with
another on the other side of it, and my stud groom,
a most experienced man, tested the leg and said
that he had never in his life seen anything like it.
He said it was like steel. The veterinary said
the same. I received a letter from Col. Melvill,
Consul-General at Baghdad, a little while ago, in
which he forwarded me some papers from Eng-
land, making bitter complaint that the character
of the pure Arab was being damaged by young
officers bringing home to England “ Syrian ”
Arabs and calling them pure, and the same has
been done wholesale in Australia with “ Bombay ”
Arabs. The description, “ a fine-looking horse,”
would alone make me question the breed of
those alleged Arabs.
THE EMU AND THE SPECTACLES AND
THE MYSTIFIED LADY HELP.
LADY HELP ( fairly flabbergasted): “ I’ll take me
o'th I put me specs on that there stump.”
“Harry Stockdale ” : “ Poodgeregah ”
states (B. 13/8/’08) : “Two stations in Southern
Queensland had Arab horses standing for a
couple of seasons, and then gave them up
in disgust, as 90 per cent, of their stock were
weedy and unsafe in the legs.” Taking it
for granted that “ P.” is correct in his facts,
it simply goes to prove that the Arab is
even less desirable than I said he was—inferior to
our own thoroughbreds in speed, endurance, and
weight-carrying powers, and also, according to
“ Poodgeregah,” in the soundness of his legs and
feet. Though this charge Of unsoundness is
quite at variance with my own experience, I am
free to admit there must be some grounds for it,
as a horsey friend of mine, Mr. Harry Dawson,
assured me (prior to my writing on the subject)
that stock bred from Arab sires had this defect
when ridden over rough and hilly country. So
in the interests of breeders it may be fortunate
that “P.” has ventilated the matter. The en-
vironment of the Arab has for some 1400 or 1500
years been flat, sandy country, and it may be that
it will take two or three generations to overcome
such continuity of abode. Then it must be borne
in mind that many of our best thoroughbreds are
such close goers (daisy cutters) as to be prover-
bially unpleasant as hackneys, though some of
them are possessed of excellent feet and legs. In
many instances, horses that feel unsafe in saddle
are so rather from defective or badly-placed
shoulders than from unsoundness. Most Arab
sires that I have known, when crossed with well-
grown mares, sired stock bigger than themselves,
and it must not be overlooked that amongst all
kinds of well-bred horses there is, unfortunately,
a big percentage of little ’uns.

In July of this year, an Aberdeen trawler
steamed'into Grimsby (Eng.), bringing with it
the first tangible proof known to history of the sea
serpent’s existence. The relic was an enormous
skull, almost as big as an elephant’s, and it had
been scooped up out of the depths of the Atlantic
by the vessel’s net, during trawling operations off
the north coast of Scotland. The sea serpent has
kept bobbing up and down in literature for thou-
sands of years, and so many people have been
called liars because of him that, whenever he has
been sighted from the coast or a vessel’s deck, the
lone observer has rushed away to round up two
reliable witnesses and a J.P. before committing
himself. By the time he got back, the serial
monster had generally dived below for another
hundred years’ sojourn in the immortal slime, and
the discoverer, on seeing only a blank seascape,
usually muttered something about having made a
mistake, and walked hurriedly away. Livy was
the first man who had the courage to mention
the sea serpent. The one he met was 120 ft. long,
and lived by the river Bragrados, near Ithaca.
An ancient gentleman called Diodorus Siculus also
told a doubtful yarn about a snake 60ft. long that
came ashore now and then and ate cattle. (The
Bulletin resides next door to a 24ft. python that
lives on sleep and meditation.) The animal of
Diodorus was eventually captured in a net and
carried alive to Alexandria, where it was forced
on King Ptolemy 11. by being left on the palace
doormat. Ptolemy didn’t want the thing, and
shouted something to that effect from the palace
roof, but the fishermen were so darned sick of
carting their animal about that they coiled it up
on the door mat after dark and fled back to the
coast. Since Ptolemy’s day, different navigators
and seamen have’recorded sea serpents in logs,
and have related yarns about sea serpents in bar
parlors ; but there has always been a strong sus-
picion of rum about the stories, and nobody would
listen to them unless first bribed with a drink.
The skull from the North Sea is the only thing the
snake yarns of ages have to rest on, and there is
ho guarantee that it doesn’t belong to a drowned
elephant. It may have belonged to a Scotch sea
serpent named McHaggis, or it may not.

“ F.H.R.” : The lizard that “ Prooshan ”
inquires about (B. 3"0/7/’0S) is generally known as
the rock adder, although he frequents dead trees
considerably. I have seen him in many parts,
and the marvellous protection Nature affords her
subjects allows him to have a suit of clothes to
match the coloring of his residence. In box logs I
have found him grey. In pine country, drab—
almost black —and here his tail seems elongated,
but it is still detachable. In granite country I
have seen him almost purple, and in the sandstone
rocks just out from Dubbo (N.S.W.), which seems
to be his headquarters, he is the hue of rich
cream. I saw one once in pudding-stone country
of a mottled color greatly resembling the markings
of the leopard. He shows fight readily and never
loses his head, though the least touch on the back
will make him lose his tail. When he opens his
mouth it is the size of the Jenolan Caves and
shows two nasty fangs. Some people say that if
the blood is out of order a bite is deadly. Haven’t
died myself, so can’t say. Perhaps these people
have been drinking. When erect on all fours and
savage, he can sustain a great weight for his size.
He would make unique fireirons if he grew a bit
bigger. Has a large eye like a frog’s. Bites as
readily as a dog, but doesn’t bark, being too busy
over other matters.

“ Werrimee ” : Referring to the brittle-
tailed lizard, “Sapphire” (B. 13/8/’08) perpe-
trates this obvious lie
These lizards are known colloquially as “ wood-adders,”
and one generally meets them on dead ironbarks. They
are “ pyzonous ” all right. Six inches of adder and our
pup had an argument one grey, sad day. The adder fled
after a while, but it left its tail on Tiny’s nose. Tiny
“ crossed the bar ” moaning - .
In the first place, the two lizards are distinct, the
brittle gentleman being a giant in size compared
with the other. Secondly, the wood-adder is a
harmless little creature, and may be handled with
impunity. Heloderma suspcetum —which its habi-
tat is Arizona and New Mexico —is the only
venomous lizard so far known on this planet.
He is commonly called the Gila Monster.
“ Sapphire” has evidently been told the old yarn
that the death adder has a sting in its tail,
which it hasn’t, and is under the impression that
the wood-adder is a pocket edition of it, or an
understudy, or something like that. Both the
brittle-tail and wood-adder are very plentiful on
the Richmond River (N.S. W.) and thereabouts.
AN ECHO OF THE LATE TRAM STRIKE.
BENEVOLENT OLD PARTY : “And what have you been punished for , my lad?”
SMALL BOY (whose father drives a tram): “’Cause the master sez I spelt loyalist wrong.”
B.O.P.: “ Well, and how did you spell it?”
S.B.: “ S-C-A-B .”
A stingray weighing about 2001 b. now
excites wonderment. But stingrays of 4001 b.
and over have been common in the bays along the
coast. The couple of rays which gave Botany Bay
its original name of Stingray Bay, in Cook’s day,
were over 3001 b. each —3361 b. according to Cook’s
somewhat defective weighing machine. They
astonished Cook at the time, but far bigger ones
were encountered on the Queensland coast. Sting-
rays reach enormous size in Australian waters,
scwt. of the animal being occasionally met with.
“ Karl ” : Re “ Agricola ” and water hya-
cinth (B. 25/C/’08). Dubbo(N.S.W.) is not the only
new district to report the deadly vegetable. The
East Maitland Shire Council has
received warning that it is at
large in the wilds of Wallis
Creek. Its presence in the
Hunter tributary, how-
ever, will not be nearly
so disastrous as it would,
be in the Macquarie,
Darling, or other slug-
gish streams of the
West, since it doesn’t
thrive in tidal waters
to any great extent.
Still, it may be trusted
to make itself parlously
inconvenient. The
back-blocker refuses to
profit by the bitter
experience of others in
regard to the hyacinth
curse. Only lately, in
the Murray district, I had
a small patch proudly
pointed out to me in a lagoon near the river,
and was informed that it “came from a little
bit the missus had growing in a kerosene tin
in the back verandah.’’ I held forth at length,
but the cocky smiled and reckoned it took it all its
time to grow, let alone spread.

“ Boronia ” defends himself: “The
Lizard,” in his anxiety (B. 23/7/’08) to prove me
incompetent as a poison-plant authority, misses a
point which is the crux of the whole discussion.
There is in W.A. more than one variety of murder
vegetable. In fact, altogether there are about six—
the most virulent being York-road, heart-leaf,
bloom and box. When I wrote the par. to which
“The Lizard” takes exception, I had the heart-
leaf variety of poison in mind, a brand which I
defy” The Lizard” or any other person to com-
pletely eradicate. “The Lizard” mentions two
large landholders who battled with the poison and
beat it easily. What sort was it? There is
poison plant that I wouldn’t object to see piled
three feet high on any of my land, for it is as easy
to wipe out as falling off a log. There is a variety
contrariwise that causes many a stout-hearted
battler with inscrutable old Nature to pack up his
traps and flit to a fresh holding once it gets a firm
grip on his (the battler’s) property—for it is as
pervasive and unshiftable as original sin.

Some N.S.W. Pasture Boards are wooden.
Years ago they offered 15s. a scalp for foxes ; now
they offer 2s. 6d. As a consequence, foxes in-
crease and multiply ; sheep are killed, and turkeys
lose the number of their mess, while Reynard
smiles with feathers in his whiskers. Those
Boards say they have reduced the price on account
of the great increase in the numerousness of the
pest. It follows that when the fox further in-
creases the scalper will be cut down to Is.,
and finally, when foxes swarm over the land, those
Boards, if not broken up or burned, will give
nothing for a scalp. In fact, when the landscape
becomes a solid wall or carpet of fox they will
probably fine you for killing the mephitic beast
with the brown breath.
“ Jobber ” : “ Henry Phelthatt ” asks (B.
13/8/’08) about record walks. Well, a man with
whom I go a-lying from time to time once stepped
from Harrow to Hamilton (Vic.), 65 miles, in 16
hours. On another occasion, for the mere joy of
wearing-out boot-leather, he trudged from Mount
.Gambier (S.A.) to St. Kilda (Vie.). This took
him six days. I won’t swear to the exact distance,
but I think it’s 308 miles. Even I, a rank ama-
teur, am proud of the fact that I travelled with
Matilda and a water-bag (the worst part of the
outfit to carry) from a shed on the Warrego to
Bourke in a day—42 weary miles of sand and flies
and heat !
FAIR EXCHANGE.
PUB-KEEPER : “ Look ’ ere , this is a crook tanner .”
BLOKE: “ That's orl right. This is crook beer.”
“ Billy T.” : This is a fairly rare thing in
gum-tree adventures. Remember when I was a
youngster at Cardigan (Vic.) seeing a huge gum
suspended high in the air in a horizontal position.
The tree had been felled for palings. In falling
one of its big lower limbs locked across the lower
limb of a brother gum, but the force was so great
that the butt jumped in the air, and there the
“fallen” tree remained, balanced and hung up for
good. As proof that even a 10-foot gum cannot
put up with everything, I may say that the stand-
ing tree died in a” year—killed by its great burden,
I presume.
“ Machete ” : Have been reading the rival
pig liars’ efforts with much interest. Both sides
are nearly right, though, all the same, “Henry
Phelthatt” (B. 13/8/’08) is straining him-
self when he says a pig pursued him 2J
miles. The distance may have looked like that,
but it wasn’t. I have slain many pigs with the
spear on horseback, and my efforts in that direc-
tion extend over several years. My experience is
that in the winter a pig. if not too fat, can put up
a good pace for half-a-mile or so, and keep
dodging about for some time after that. In the
blazing Western summer time, however, Brother
(or Sister) Pig knocks up almost immediately, the
more readily because dead sheep are plentiful
then, and he gets a lot of condition on him. Pigs
haunt the swamps and river bends in hot weather,
and at these times they will fight anything sooner
than face a gallop in the open. But even when a
good running pig was in question I never knew a
decent stockhorse that couldn’t give the ani-
mated bacon 200yds. start and catch him well
under a mile.
THE COMING OF THE ASS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
It is to be regretted that very few asses have been
imported into the Dominion. —Maoriland press comment.
The beeves are lowing in the flaxen swamp,
I hear the whinny of the racing prad,
The muttons seek at eve their mountain camp,
But I am sad.
What boots it that through mud we wrangle sore
For Rugby triumph in the embuttocked scrum,
When to our windy and forgotten shore
No donkeys come.
Each queenly ship that sails the fluent ways
Brings immigrants from ancient lands afar ;
The ass his joyous coming still delays,
So there you are !
Wise men alone have we imported here,
And little wonder that our souls are glum ;
Shall we have deeper joy and better cheer
When donkeys come ?
Blow, happy winds, across the ocean free,
Blow till our clouds dispel and sorrows pass,
Till with the voice of joy and jubilee
We hail the ass.
MAORILAND.

“ Itan ” : Queensland lately bad. an attack
of the disease which makes the victim want to
import somebody to do something that our own
people can do better ; and it has foisted the new
man, a vet., who doesn’t know Australian con-
ditions, over the head of bacteriologist Pound.
The latter has thqj;qughly justified his position,
and has carried out research work which has been
freely recognised by the scientific world. At the
time the Government was looking about for a tick
expert, no one knew exactly why the inquiry
should go abroad, since Bound had studied the
tick in all its bearings, and was probably
the world’s authority on the little beast.
When the new vet.’s application was under
consideration, he worked the salary up to
£7OO a year ; and the more he asked the
more Queensland seemed determined to get
him. But what has Bananaland secured
for its money? It finds that the officers of the
Stock Department know as much about tick as
the imported expert does—in fact, more. Only
the other day the new authority penned an article
which told people about the anti-tick treatment
practised in North Carolina, which treatment
worked out at a cost of lOd. per head. The
measures in vogue in Queensland cost only a frac-
tion of that, and are as effective as those in use
in any part of the world. The Imported Genius
is now making promises—(l) to experiment with
the tick on a State farm (which Pound would
have done if he had got the chance); (2) to hunt
for a virus which will clear away pie,uro-pneumonia
(already done in the Transvaal); (3) to discover a
black-leg vaccine for the use of stock (there is
already an effective one for sale in Queensland
shops); (4) to conduct experiments with noxious
plants (Queensland Botanist Bailey has been
doing that with great success for a generation or
two). But the imported man has a three years’
agreement with the State, and even if he were to
do nothing more than make promises, the Govern-
ment could only grin and bear it—and risk losing
the proved and valuable Pound in the meantime.
AN ALLURING PROSPECT.
THIRSTY PARTY: “ Say, Bill, I wouldn't mind
bein' one of them barrister blokes.”
BILL: “ 'Ow’s that ?”
T.P.: “ It sez 'ere some of ’em talk at a bar for
weeks, an’ keep gettin ’ refreshers all the time."
“ Dandalup ” : Like a well-known judicial
personage, I concur with “Groper” (B. 6/8/’oB)in
his judgment on the Westralian brumby, and I
also say emphatically that he is the toughest thing
I know of, barring the cheek of a Tory politician.
IN BEAT SOCIETY.
DOSSER: “ Why're yeh dodgin' 'Alligan, Limpy?”
LIMPY LEONALRD: “ He's a bloomin’ nuisance, 'Enery. He's always wantin' me to back a bill."
Why, I’m wearing bluchers now which I had
made of old brumby hide over 20 years ago, and I
can’t wear them out ! An uncle of mine occasion-
ally makes decent cheques by sending shipments
of brumbies to the Singapore and Indian markets.
They stand the hot weather well and don’t knock
up like the purer breeds. A good cross between
brumby and pure-blood invariably throws some-
thing extra special in the way of stamina and pace,
though not of great size. In the markets of Asia
good brumbies have been known to bring as much
as £3O each, while £2O and over is a common
figure. I had a pair which I have often driven
50 and 60 miles a day, and next morning they
would be as fresh as paint and ready to start again.
Sometimes they would make several similar
journeys during the week, but nothing seemed to
affect them. In fact, the more they worked the
harder they got. One died at the grand old age
of 18 years, and the other still survives and does
occasional jobs, age 20. Like the blackfellow, the
brumby easily goes back to its natural state, and
I have known brums that had been worked for
years to suddenly clear into the bush and join the
wild mobs. In all the tameness and
docility is gone, and brum is once again a wild,
mad king of the wilderness.
“Billy T.” : The new barmaid at
Black’s Sheepdog Inn, Cattle Flats, was a
red and black person with plenty of develop-
ment and an eye like gun-metal. She just
suited Cattle Flats. None of Black’s habi-
tuals felt ill at ease with Minnie, as they
had always done with the Missus and with
the previous pale-eyed and somewhat frigid
Hebe ; and the result was an abundant
attendance at the Sheepdog of evenings,
and correspondingly bad business at Saunder-
son’s Scotch Thistle. Within a month seven
men wanted to make a lawful wedded wife of
the buxom barmaid, Tom Hill more particu-
larly ; and Tom had the luck. It was Tom
who rolled Minnie in a tent-fly, and extin-
guished the conflagration when her clothes
ignited at an open-air fire one washing day.
It was Tom who pulled her out of the river
when the boat overturned at the miners’
picnic. When Minnie really needed assist-
ance, Tom always seemed to be handy ; and
then Minnie agreed to marry Don Casterton.
There was general amazement. Suitors who
had retired from the fray in the belief that
the prize was practically Hill’s expressed loud
disgust. Tom was crushed. A sort of deputa-
tion reproached Minnie for her base ingrati-
tude. “What, me marry Tom Hill?” said the
lady. “Not much. I’ve got nothing
against him. Why, he saved my life!”
This seemed paradoxical, but six months
later, when Casterton fled for his life to
parts unknown, the last of the household
crockery striking him in the back of the
neck as he started, Cattle Flats understood
the case. Minnie was evidently a lady with
no delusions about her own complete unfitness
for domestic life.
“ J.P.” : On the sea coast of Hawkes Bay
(M.L.) there is a little township that staggers under
the name Tamatauwhakatangihangakoauaotane-
nuiarangikitanatahu, which, being interpreted,
meaneth “ The hill on which the husband of
. , . , „ , n ,
Heaven played his flute to his beloved. There
wm be tr F ouble when a telephone bureau is estab-
' lished in that village, and an enraged subscriber
to the exchange in Napier is made more savage
by the ’phone maiden remarking : “I don’t quite
catcb t }, e name of the bureau you want—spell it,
p] ease> ” Probably before then, however, the
will become simply Smithville.
WILL THEY EVER KNOW THE BUSHLAND?
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Will they ever know the Bushland,
They who leave the dusty town,
With their spectacles and note-books,
With their learnfed look and frown ;
With their cant of seeking knowledge
And their eyes alert to scan
All the traces of the Savage
That survive in Western Man ?
Can they ever know the Bushland,
They who view it through the glass
Of the cushioned first-class carriage
As the roaring specials pass?
Can they ever know the Bushland,
They who love the city bars,
And have never pressed her bosom
As she sleeps beneath the stars ?
You may roam the bush in summer,
You may range her in the spring ;
You may spoil her when the autumn
Bends above with weary wing ;
But, unless you come a lover,
Bent to win her lover-wise,
You will never gauge the passion
That is lurking in her eyes.
Now a lover —now a mother —
Does she greet us in her croon,
Ever calling, ever calling
In a mystic kind of rune ;
And, howe’er her children wander,
And, howe’er her lovers roam,
She can, drawn them when she listeth
With her winds that whisper “ Home ! ”

No notice (except of a hostile character) ivill be taken of
communications insufficiently stamped. Name and
address must appear on MSS. No liability is under-
taken re contributions voluntarily submitted, whether
sent by post or handed in; and no MS. will be
returned unless stamps (of any State) accompany.
Cosallen : You say that you “cannot find words
to express the contempt ” in which that correspondent
“ should be held by right-thinking people,” be-
cause ■he said something mildly uncomplimentary
about a royal lady who is dead. Well, we can
only hope that your language about Herodias, Cathe-
rine de Medici, Lucrezia Borgia, Mary I. of England,
Judas Iscariot, Nero, Barabbas, etc., is always respectful
and laudatory, they being all dead. If you speak ill of
Nero (who is dead), our loathing for you will pass expres-
sion, and we will regard you as a disreputable hound.
Also, please note that this world’s two boss horrors are (1)
right-thinking people and (2) tight-drinking people.

“ Pirates of Penzance” is quite impossible, for pirates are

every poem containing the phrase “Yo ho !” that has
reached this office in the last ten years K.H.L. : Read
“A Dream of the Hated One” three times, and then
hurled it uncomprehendingly aside. It is one of litera-

I dreamt that I stood where a curtain hung,
Where a madman lurched behind.
’Twas a mansion grand, and the lamp that burned
Still flickering old with age.
With an angry eye by the screen he stood
And rattled the floor with rage.
W. Smith: Your “few lines on the return of Mr.
G. S. Titheradge” arrived after the paper had gene to
press. Besides, our own representative was there
Myrtle: That curious bed yarn has reached us several
times of late. It seems to be an epidemic lie J.R. :
Nothing wildly hilarious in the fact that a small lad got
confused over the word “ triplet.” J.P.W. : Too Bruce
Smithian in the matter of style. Witness this : “ For
the fact of such being existent, creates the necessity for
the immediate inception of effective collatorial measures

tedly such measures have been placed on the Statute, but
they were apologetic because they were proved unwork-
able.” The Freak : Nothing intrinsically humorousin a

Pretty good, but we grow surfeited with “ the call of the
Blood,” the “ flag with the stripe and the star,” and such-
like well-knowm props Mac: Unsuitable. Five eight-
line stanzas each ending' “ Where is Wellington, by-the-
bye?” indicates, on your part, a disproportionate view
of the interest Australia takes in the location of M.L.
towns.. ..Syd. C. : Neither anywhere near “up.”
Olave A.: “Lust and Love” too scorching F. :
Humorous, but not skilfully enough done Mollie
Bawn : Some good lines, but more bad ones. Summed
up, your verse is too crude.... Tee Cee : In “Eyes of
Grey,” for instance, there are four verses. (1) You
rhvme lines 2 and 4 ; (2) you rhyme lines 1,2, and 4 ; (3
and 4) you rhyme lines 2 and 4. Why this erratic tend-
ency? And the verses aren’t remarkably good
J.W.L. : “Warrego” just missed the bull’s optic
Unit: Lines “To the First Man ” start well, and peter
out. The theme is one that takes more handling than
you wot of., J.W.D. : Accurately rhymed and
ornate, but it doesn’t say enough for our taste.
Thomas Francis: Probably the Badminton Library
volume entitled “Boxing.” Any bookseller will get it
for you ... R.C. : An oft-uttered moan, and the Latin
quotes don’t give it an air of freshness.. . .Dolores : It is
a pretty rhapsody and a clever one, but it isnj a story.
And the voice of the Woman with a Past, crying about
the things that were Previous, is very frequent in the
land C.G. : Sorry to say that “Shopkeepers of Syd-
ney” mislaid the ’bus....Un Mouton Gris : The theory
that all the white peoples of the British Empire are
yearning for London is too thin. They aren t all cockneys
and “ street-bred people”—fortunately. And out of the
6 000,000 odd people in London there are probably one-
half who wouldn’t care if they never saw the place
again W.P. : Mere rhymes without metre
Fat Importer : You send us, with great pride, a par about
a British Board of Trade return, which says that “the
German rate of wages per hour is about three-quarters of
the British rate, while the cost of rent, food, and fuel is
nearly one-fifth greater than in England ” : also, that
“the income-tax in Germany comes down t q incomes as
low as £45 a year.” Well, that Board of Trade report
was withdrawn, 12 days after it was issued, as abowled-out
lie, devised by certain Freetraders to prop up their fail-
ing superstition—a pretty bad disgrace for an official docu-
ment. As regards the taxation question—British taxa-
tion, 68s. per head per annum (that is apart from local
rates, which run as high as 9s. in the £of rental); Ger-
man, 40s. Some petty German States may levy the in-
come-tax you mention, but there is no German (i.e.
Imperial) income-tax at all Benedict: Can’t satisfy
your yearning for particulars. Never met Kathleen
Walker in the flesh (which is our loss), and only know by
her contributions that she is a girl with a spark of the
real poetic fire in her. Whether her age is 22£ or 23 you
must find out for yourself. Better advertise in the agony
column of the Age Constant Reader :- There was no
Lone Hand article on the Melbourne Art Gallery, but in
the issue of December last an article appeared dealing
with the Felton Bequest, and there was another the
previous October about the Melbourne Art Society’s Show.
R.T.G. : Fleet joke arrived too late.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC) CONTRIBUTORS.
Henry G. : Drawing not strong enough to carry very
moderate joke, and joke not strong enough to carry very
moderate drawing. ...Griff : Regret to say none of them are
very promising.... Bob S. : Picture crude, and the lady

done some time ago by a better artist.

is at once a text-book on Australian Radicalism

“The Disadvantages of Being Too Serious.”

THE INTERFERING ARM OF THE LA W.
Adelaide, Monday.—A large crowd witnessed a foot-
ball match between Summertown and Uraidla, on the
Summertown grounds, on Saturday. It was a close
game, and when the umpire gave a mark, a Uraidla foot-
baller struck him a severe blow in the face, and then for
fully five minutes a free fight ensued between the two
teams. Many players were badly marked. Some of the
less scrupulous supporters rushed in, and but for the
plucky action of Constable Thompson, it is difficult to
imagine what the result might have been. Thefinal scores
were :—Summertown, 4 goals 8 behinds ; Uraidla, 4 goals
4 behinds.
Death (to the constable): “Now, then, don’t be
a spoil-sport! ”
Four goals eight. Nine men dead,
To four goals four, And.a whole lot more,
Three black eyes If the blamed old cop
To one broke “ jore .” Hadn’t stopped the score.
James Rutherford, an American by birth,
who came to Australia in 1853, celebrated his 81st
birthday a little while ago. Soon after his arrival
in Australia he associated himself with Cobb and
Co., and in 1861 came to N. S. Wales as managing
partner. He has made his home in Bathurst ever
since. He was the first to establish iron and
pottery works, in connection with the late Enoch
Hughes, at Lithgow, and spent thousands of
pounds in attempting to establish the iron indus-
try at a time when the Freetrade curse made
anything of the kind practically impossible.
An exceptionally tough Australian passed
out at Melbourne Homcepathic Hospital lately.
On August 8 Robert Michael Tyrell fell from a
dray and broke his neck. Yet he didn’t die till
the 18th.
“ Via ” : Prime Minister Deakin wrote to
a Brisbane friend, last week, and said he would
shortly visit Queensland, but that it would pro-
bably be as plain Alfred Deakin.
David Christie Murray, journalist, author,
lecturer and occasional actor, who died re-
cently, left an estate valued only at £5O. He had
the Bohemian temperament, and led the preca-
rious life all his days.
Lewis Adolphus Bernays, clerk of Queens-
land Parliament ever since Responsible Govern-
ment was established in 1859, and who flung off re-
cently for the last time the best-known single pane
of eyeglass in Brisbane, is understood to have left a
valuabjecollection of papers behind him. Through-
out his career—going back to the days of Governor
Fitzroy, in IST. S. Wales—he kept' a diary with
more or less assiduity ; and there ought to be
good matter for the historian buried there.
That much-disturbed Victorian sky pilot,
the Rev. Nash, has now got a steady preaching
job at St. Paul’s, Sale, so it is to be hoped the
tale of his woes will cease from troubling. All
the same, the conviction remains that the arch-
bishop who made all the confusion is an illogical
and disorganised old woman, who allowed herself
to be led away by gossip, and by the revelations
of persons who looked through keyholes, and the
vague statements of individuals who thought they
remembered having heard something; and the
end was that he got lost in a muddle of rumors
and didn’t know where she were.
The lately-deceased Nick Fitzgerald never
climbed higher in politics than when he was
appointed one of the Victorian members of
“ Parkes’ Federal Convention ”in iB9l. The
intervening 17 years have made tremendous gaps
in the list of Nicholas’ fellow-members. Each
State had seven representatives. Not one of the
N.S.W. men is now in politics: only Edmund
Barton and McMillan are alive, and of the Vic-
torians only Deakin and Wrixon. Griffith was
vice-president; Parkes, Of course, was president.
Hori Grey was present, With Atkinson and Capt.
Russell from Maoriland—all of them gone. The
h. Australians hold out best; Playford is still
growing cherries and cabbages ; Dr. Cockburn is
guinea-pigging in London ; on old John Downer’s
prize-fighter face Time makes few marks ; Gordon
is on the Bench ; and Chaffey Baker is living at
his ease. That was the Convention at which
Macrossan, of Queensland, propelled himself into
Australia’s eye, and earned encouraging words
from Hori Grey; but Macrossan was almost the
first to pass out.
“C?”: For many years the just-dead
L. A. Bernays, clerk of Queensland. Assembly,
was the subject of heated contention on
the floor of the House. Bernays held
two salaried billets—clerk of the As-
sembly and secretary to the Board of
Waterworks—and he had also been
from time immemorial a director of the
Brisbane Gas Co. When the Labor
party poured moderately into Parlia-
ment, under Glassey, Bernays’ two
billets got on to its nerves, and the
elegant old monocled clerk used to sit,
without turning a hair, and hear him
self abused extravagantly. In those
days the Labor party was wild and
woolly, and couldn’t stand Lewis
Adolphus Bernays—with his “haw-
haw,” his high-sounding name, his eye-
glass, his double-barrelled billet, and
his inscrutability. But it grew to more
than like the cultured old gentleman,
whose courtly manners, anxiety to
oblige, and lofty character soon ap-
pealed to the Laborites’ rough but true
appreciation of real worth. Mr. Ber-
nays was the repository of the political
secrets of many Premiers, but his real
tastes were scientific.
Mining-Manager Osborne Thomp-
son, of Charters Towers, has sounded
the knocker for the last time, aged 68.
Thirty years ago he was one of the
original shareholders in the Dan
O’Connell with Nicholas Mayne and
others. Later he managed the No. 2! Queen, now
known as the New Queen ; afterwards he battled
► with the North Queen amid luck that was mostly
pretty bad.
“ Ancient Inhabitant ” writes ;
“ Well-informed ” Sydney journalists have stated that
Ensign Robert Emmet, of the U.S. flagship Connecticut,
is a descendant of Robert Emmet, the Irish patriot,
leader of the rebellion of 1803, who was hanged from a
lamp-post in Thomas-street, Dublin, near Guinness’s
Brewery of to-day. Robert’s brother, Thomas Addis
Enunet, elder by 16, years, had, with Robert, been
expelled from Trinity College in 1798. lie got to America,
where he established himself in a lucrative business as a
lawyer. The gentleman on board thd.Connecticut is a
descendant of this Thomas Addis Emmet. Any well-
informed journalist who had read the verses written by
Moore on the loves of Robert Emmet and Curran’s
daughter might have guessed that the patriot died
unmarried.
“ Ganesha,” about a really affable Gover-
nor :
Sir Thomas Gibson Carmichael, Victoria’s Caledonian
Governor, has an excellent notion of the high duties of a
representative of the Crown. Over a recent haggis he
admitted that he didn’t know what those duties were,
but he trusted he would carry them out. Tam means
well. He wishes to bring himself closer to the people,
and the people closer to himself. He has become patron
of everything—that is all that is left for a State Governor.
Every morn the Argus records his exploits in this one
line of business left open for Governors. Tammy is patron
of a Bagpipes Club, also a Brose Bond. He is patron of a
Hen Association. The Mothers’ Union and the Dorcas
Guild now continue the good work under his distin-
guished patronage. There is no dirty pride about Tam.
A “ Rose of Footscrav ” football club that plays, in torn
pants and striped jerseys, in a swamp, claims the Scotch
Governor as one of its patrons. He is patron of a White
Mice Creche, a Lodge for Idle Rich, a Society for Preserv-
ing Duck Eggs—all kinds of odd-size gatherings of science,
art, gossip, pumpkin-growing, rare-bug collecting, and
afternoon tea. His latest exploit was to become patron
of a Draughts Association for the advancement of the
grand old Scottish game of pushing, with the judgment
and deliberation of Solomon, small pieces of wood across
a tartan board. Now does Australia badly need to pay
£5OOO a year to an official draughts-encourager?
A LAST WORD.
Yes, its a durn fine continent. Why don’t you run a railway across it? And, I say ,

T. B. Gaden, chief inspector of the Com-
mercial Banking Co. of Sydney’, retires after ,48
years’ service. Gaden was als£>, assistant general
manager of the bank. For along time past two

Shore boat to the bank at 9 a.m., and going to
lunch, and returning from lunch, and scooting
with a dignified scoot for the boat in the evening,
were those of Gaden and T. A; Dibbs,'general
manager. Dibbs is the older of the two, but he

“ D.” reminisces somewhat :
The late W. P. Crick had a wonderful hold on the
Blayney electorate. I was editinga Bathurst daily during
the Blayney by-election in 1907, and had an opportunity
of judging in this regard. We were for Beeby (Labor)
against Withington (the Hard-Borrowing candidate).
On the figures of previous elections it looked a
certainty for Beeby. But Crick had taken umbrage
at the action of the Laborites in putting forward
a vote-splitting candidate (had they not done so
he would have run himself, and would: unquestionably
have won), so he set out to give Beeby and his adherents
a lesson. Withhcalm audacity he circularised his sup-
porters, announcing that he wasn’t going, to stand, and
requesting them not to vote either for Beeby or for
Withington—in effect to disfranchise themselves. This
hv way of protest against, the treatment he had received.
We Beebyites were inclined at first to scoff at the
scheme, not believing for a moment that any con-
siderable body of electors would so humor an
ex-member. Then as the days passed it became apparent
that things were serious. Wherever one went through-
out the constituency one struck dogged agriculturists
who weren’t going to vote ; they didn’t argue the point—
they just meant to refrain from exercising, the franchise,
and that was all about it. It was goinig to hit Beeby
hard, of course, since a clear 50 per cent.’of Crick’s sup-
porters were Laborites in the case of any candi-
date barring Crick. A week before polling day I
went fishing to the Duckmaloi country. The number
of Crick-ites I struck was appalling, and none of
them meant to vote. J. C. Watson, Holman, and a
number of other Labor men, Federal and State, were camp-
ing on the river-bank, and they put in a strenuous week’s
electioneering. They held meetings at which the natives
attended and listened courteously enough ; and they
canvassed personally like mad. I don’t think
they influenced a single vote anywhere. No
Crick supporters voted for Withington Crick
hadn’t asked for that. They simply refrained in
hundreds from voting for Beeby, and the result was that
in a purely Labor electorate this brainy and magnetic
candidate was beaten by a man of no great parts whom
the majority of the electors hadn’t heard of till a few
weeks previously. The figures from the different centres
told their tale clearly enough. Thus, at Vittoria, where
Crick, in 1904, scored 94 votes, Beeby got but 26 : Triangle
Flat gave Crick 32 votes, it gave Beeby six ; Lagoon gave
Crick 80, it gave Beeby 32. And so on indefinitely.
Duckmaloi, which had for years been wont to record its
total of 20 votes or so for Crick, disfranchised itself—with
one exception. The defaulter, whose crime was that he
registered a vote for Beeby, did not hold his head up
again for weeks. It was an interesting exhibition of the
liberties a man of strong personality may take with his
faithful supporters.
A little man stepped in the shop,
And said : “ Now you be sure
To give me what I ask for pop,
That’s Woods’ Great Peppermint Cure.
It’s no use to try and force
On me some other class,
For though I am a little hoarse
I’m not a little ass.”
A Sydney dulcet- week victim of street-
accident was Alexander Hutchison, who in the
early ’nineties represented Glen Innes in the
N.S.W. Assembly A; He never made much of a
mark; yet in wild,...whirling Scots’ accents he
advocated some ideas that have many more friends
now than they had then—among them the aboli-
tion of the superfluous House of Fat, of which
good cause he was the most persistent advocate
while Parliament knew him.
Another of the little band which, in the
’fifties, pioneered the eight-hours movement in
Melbourne joined his mates' in the Beyond on
Saturday. He was J. H. C. Sutherland, who
arrived in Melbourne in the ship'Clieviot in 1854.
From very small beginnings Mr. Sutherland
became one .of the principal Vic. contractors, and
many,of- .the best buildings in and around Mel-
bourne were erected under his supervision.
Some: Australian-American notes
Charlie Nuttall, the young Melbourne artist who com-
mended himself to posterity by his well-known picture of
the Federal Parliament Inauguration, is back among his
oldffriends for a few weeks. Nuttall went to the
States three years ago, and expects to be there for another
three ere he returns to his own country to settle down.
Americans thus far, he says, have needed all the en-
lightening re Australia that the Fleet visit will give them.
A self-centred-people, they are not much interested in
European affairs,: and as for Australia !—when he first
.. arrived among them he found that the land he talked of
was pretty generally unknown. “ Englishman, I guess,”
said the average Yank. The statement that he had
“ come from Australia” provoked in one instance the
question as to “what part of Britain that was situated
in!” Yet the prevailing ignorance of this country’s
whereabouts is bracketed with a national knowledge of the
Australian ballot. The U.S. system of voting at political
and municipal elections, though commonly referred to as
the “ Australian ” ballot system, is not uncommonly
supposed to have originated in an English county.
Charlie Nuttall got his first job in an “ advertising
house ’’—practically an advertisement factory—as one of
a number of artists employed in executing the firm’s
orders. Some of the biggest of such houses employ as
many as 50 artists, in addition to a large literary staff, for
the American advertiser attaches as much importance to
the preparation of his ad. as to the placing of it in the
press. At last Nuttall got a chance to assert himself —
on the front page of Life—and from that time he
came into request as an illustrator. His work-
ing experiences have been confined to New
York, a city which it is IT—l to he poor in.
Money is made to be spent in New-York. A man of strict
economy is likely to get left with nothing to save. Of the
Australian artists whom Nuttall has met in America, the
luckiest is Bert Levy, now a successful vaudeville
exponent of the sort of work that “Cruikshank” Laing
introduced to Melbourne when he brought La Pansy
“Milo” Montague into notice. He produces the
effect of lightning sketches on a screen, and
his salary .is £4O a week. Before he got going
as an artist Bert Levy was selling haberdasherv
behind the counter at Siegel Cooper’s Department
Store in New York, but, fortunately, the chief haber-
dasher dispensed with his services, and reduced him to
the necessity of finding other employment. After he had
made his rise he got a letter from the shop offering to
take him back at the same old princely salary of £2. 'The
happiest day of Levy’s life was when he posted a cutting
reply to that letter. Nankivell, formerly of Melbourne,
continues to hold his own with the black-and-white men
in New York. Another prosperous townie of whom Nuttall
speaks is Maggie McCann. She got a chance as the
Scotch vocalist in a theatrical co., and subsequently im-
proved the shining hour by organising a co. of her own.
Maggie has lately been touring in Canada. Another Mel-
bourne girl who would have done well—pretty Gladys
Ure—was forced to leave the stage on account of her
health, and is at present earning nothing beyond “royal-
ties ”on the sale of her musical compositions. Miss Ure’s
bad luck is instanced as a reminder of the fact that the
climate of New York has no compassion for a weak chest.
THE TORTOISE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The people we really have to fear ai-e those who wish
to rush things ahead too quickly. All the difficulties with
which we are now confronted arise from that cause.—
Melbourne Argus. ,
Between the tortoise and the snail
The Argus totters on,
With evTy now and then a wail
For ev’rything that’s {■one ;
The good old days—the good old lies,
The good old musty Past,
When ev’i'y fool was wondrous wise
And nothing could go fast.
Beside the worm that rarely turns,
The Argus makes, its moan,
And bores the insect till it yearns
To squirm in peace alone ;
The old crab crawling on before
Can scarce conceal its mirth
As with the aghd, toothless bore
It travels o’er the earth.
The sedan chair has passed away,
The stage coach slowly dies ;
This is the motor’s merry day,
And soft and swift it flies.
By road and river and by rail
The whole world races on—
Then comes the Argus with the snail
When all the rest have gone.
The good old days—the bad old nights,
The dear old crusted Past,
When nothing e’er was put to rights,
And nothing- could go fast!
The young world whizzes out of hail,
A loud cheer smites the air,
For the old Argus and the Snail—
The great non-rushing pair !

THE CHORUS OF LANDOWNERS.
“Closer settlement indeed! How much closer
do they think we can get ?”
From a traveller in the unfrequented
parts of the wild Nor’-West: —
The Newton Moore Government of Westralia has de-
cided to build the Hedland-Nullagine railway. The line
is going- to do great things, of course—there won’t be any
more deficits after it is finished. Everybody in Port
Hedland barracks for it; but dig under the surface, and
you find that hardly.anybody really believes it is going to
do the alleged great things. The fact is, everybody hopes
that nobody else has noticed the holes in the arguments
in support of the line ; so everybody just waits and
watches for a chance to sell out at a boom price. The
bigger the boom the bigger the price ; and that explains
the hifalutin.
S. Australia is at last going to do some-
thing to protect Black Brother—likewise Black
Sister—of the Northern Territory. Nearly 10
years ago, when Kingston’s chum, Dashwood,
prepared a Bill, the Leg. Council practically fired
it out because it didn’t go far enough ; wherefore
the bestial Chow, with his abominable spirits and
opium, has had a free run ever since. One result
of the Dashwood measure was a Select Com-
mittee which decided what the new legislation
ought to do and be ; so the Price Government’s
job in preparing a scheme has been comparatively
easy.
Maoriland public debt is now set down at
£66,450,000, and against that the State has public
assets reckoned as worth £56,200,000. These
include all public lands except £5,800,000 worth
belonging to local authorities (they can’t fairly be
reckoned in because there is over £12,000,000 of
local debt against them); it even includes church
lands. In the way of “ railways and other public
works” there are £29,234,000 worth of assets,
which is a poor showing against over £66,000,000
of debt. No wonder Maoriland begins to see
bailiffs in its sleep, and has growing doubts about
Joseph Ward’s boom and burst policy.
The late representative of the Dutch
Associated Press in Japan and thereabouts was
lately in Brisbane trying to size up Australia,
and has been talking about the Japs, like this :
The Japanese laborer is not nearly so good as a white
laborer, and I do not think the former, if paid only
half the wages of the latter, could do half the work.
All true and well known ; but then the visitor
adds:—
If Australians are afraid of the competition of Japanese
in field labor, they are wrong, for there is absolutely no-
thing to be afraid of.
And just there the Dutch gentleman goes wrong.
As laborers the Japanese are probably better than
Kanakas ; yet Australia has good cause to re-
member the trouble it had to get rid of the
Kanaka incubus from Queensland, and the torrent
of gush that was poured out by the clerical and
other friends of the repatriated blacks. It is not
of the colored laborer that Australians are afraid,
but of the treacherous whites among themselves,
who support him independent of his merits.
A recent proposal of Premier Bent and
Minister Swinburne —or Minister Bent and
Premier Swinburne, whichever it is—is to advance
certain public moneys to “ poor farmers ” to
recoup them for losses of cows and other stock
during the recent cold weather. The Bulletin
reckons that it would be a good deal better for
the stock if Bent and Swinburne would prosecute a
few of the farmers for cruelty to animals. The
farmers of Victoria have had lessons by the dozen
as to the losses caused by drought and by cold
weather, yet they will do practically nothing to
profit by those lessons. The State will build silos
for storing feed at a very low cost and on long
terms, yet no feed is stored ; there is abundance
of wood suitable for building shelters, yet the
shelters are unbuilt; and a couple of the discarded
3001 b. wheat bags make a first-class rug at a cost
of Is. per head, yet even that isn’t attempted.
And it isn’t likely to be attempted so long as
the Treasury can be looted.
“ J.G.” writes :
Bendigo auctioneers have organised a union in slavish
imitation of the working classes. This is peculiar, since
its auctioneers have ever been amongst the most violent
of Bendigo’s Anti-Socialists. Strikes they abhorred, and
any man who stood to his union in such events was de-
nounced by these knockers down of sheep and cattle,
while the man who went back on his union won hearty
praise, and occasionally a free beer from them. Amongst
the rules of the Bendigo Union of Auctioneers w'as one
which said that all butchers who did not pay up promptly
for their live meat would have their names put upon a
black-list and their credit stopped. The butchers bucked
against this with some violence. And after awhile an
auctioneer come along and told the butchers that he had
decided to burst up the Auctioneers’ Union by selling
under the old conditions. Then the organised knockers
down of live stock called the newcomer a blank and an
asterisk and blackleg, and all the other names
mere working-men unionists call their fellows who “ rat.”
It was a fine example of how personal experience changes
the point of view.
One of those cheerful Victorian persons
who habitually undervalue country lands for
rating purposes happened before Judge Choinley
at' Shepparton lately. He transpired in court
owing to an appeal against the alleged under-
valuation of certain properties. In connection
with the matter, 0. A. Burge, a sworn
valuer, assured his Honor that he con-
sidered these properties worth £8 an acre
though he had assessed them for rating
purposes at ss. per acre, which meant £5
an acre capital value on the 5 per cent,
basis. Asked how he accounted for the
' discrepancy, he explained that “it was
not usual to put on the full market value
for rating” ; also “ he supposed that pro-
perty was systematically undervalued for
such purposes.” After he had subsided
the owner came along and valued the
property at £lO an acre ! And yet Premier
Bent’s followers of the Country Party are
opposing his Land Valuation Bill, and say-
ing it is immoral and a menace to the country,
and many other bad things.
The Wages Board in the Victorian agricul-
tural implement industry has deadlocked over the
minimum wage for blacksmiths. Apparently,
the employers and employees keep moving and
rescinding resolutions that the wage be 9s. or
9s. 6d. per diem, as the case may be, without
getting any forrarder. Recently it was resolved,
on the casting vote of the chairman, that it should
be 9s. fid. per day. Whereupon the employers’
representatives said they hadn’t counted on the
chairman voting like that, and forthwith moved
that the rate be 95., which was carried, again on
the chairman’s casting vote. The employees again
moved that it be 9s. 6d., which, however, was lost.
Then they moved the adjournment of the Board
for a fortnight, that they might consider their
position. That motion was carried. So the
Board wobbled into recess, and left the case lean-
ing up against the wall, so to speak.
The stress of competitive naval ship-
building seems to have got on England’s nerves
rather badly. The paint is still hardly dry on
the much-boomed Dreadnought, yet the London
Daily Chronicle hysterically asserts that the big
ship is already obsolete, and that the Indomitable
—the 25-knot battleship cruiser—is the type of
vessel Britain had better stock up with. Allow-
ing that the Chronicle was over-excited when it
made the astounding assertion, it is a reminder of
the fact that Bull has eight battleships on the
effective list that date back to 1889 ! Twenty-
eight of England’s 54 heavyweights were built
prior to 1898, so it is a fair thing to assume that a
good half of the navy is well on the way to old
age. The next big naval row will see some
hideously unfair duels when the ship with ten
years’ service behind it meets the giant fresh from
the dockyard and is battered to death in one
round.
TO SPEED THE PARTING GUESTS.
“We are keeping a boot, a horseshoe, and a few other old things! ”
The Great White Fleet, now in Australian
waters, is an essay on the economy of high-priced
labor. The average wage for skilled and unskilled
labor in the private and navy dockyards of
America is 9s. and 10s. per day respectively.
Britain’s average daily pay is 55.; Japan’s even less.
And Britain has much greater experience, if not
greater facilities. Yet America’s men-of-war cost
less, for better results. The Commonwealth and
New Zealand, British battleships of 16,350 tons
each, cost £B7 4s. per ton; the Connecticut, of
16,000 tons, cost £9O, and the Louisiana, a sister
ship, cost £B6 per ton ; and the American vessels
contain more comforts and fittings. The cost of
armor is equally significant, the prices per ton
paid by the leading naval powers being : Japan,
£80; America, £B4; Germany, £9O; France,
£94 ; Italy, £llO ; England, £136.
The utter collapse of the new British
“ Territorial Army ” is a valuable lesson to Aus-
tralia. The Englishman is willing enough, in a
general way, to join the Territorial Army—which
is meant to be a Home Defence Force, something
on the Swiss model, but voluntary instead of com-
pulsory—only he dare not. The young man who
joins has to get away from his employment for
from eight to 15 days a year in order to go through
his training, and he finds that his boss won’t em-
ploy a young man who has to be absent from the
shop or office so many days in the year, when he
can get another young man who doesn’t care a
straw for the safety of his country, and so doesn’t
suffer from that disability. If the business was
compulsory, and all young men had to get so
many days’ leave (not all at once, of course) each
year for training purposes there would be no dis-
ability; but in the absence of the compulsory prin-
ciple the Territorial Army is a mere skeleton, and
the wind blows through its ribs.
A RESERVATION.
THE SAINTLY FATHER: “My boy, I strive to
live every day as if it were the last.”
THE SINFUL SON: "So do I, dad—every pay-
day, anyhow.”
The little buzzing lot of State insects has
made at least one Government tired; wherefore
Treasurer Peake announced the other day in the
S. Aus. Assembly that he and his colleagues
positively declined to oblige anybody by harassing
the Commonwealth authorities. If people had a
grievance against the Commonwealth, the proper
thing for them to do, he said, was to waylay some
member of the House of Reps, or the Senate, and
get the matter ventilated that way.
Sydney Telegraph got a cable, the other
day, reporting that the French population of 36
millions had dwindled by about 20,000 through
excess of deaths over births during the
year (of course the rush of emigrants
into Prance more than made up for the
loss); and it mourned at length over “a creeping
paralysis, the result of a deliberately suicidal
practice.” The same day it reported that in the
same year Ireland had lost by emigration another
15,000 of its 4£ millions. But the Telegraph for-
got to do any mourning over that, though it was
proportionately a vastly greater national loss, and
it wasn’t the event of one single year—it was the
50th or 60th year of great and horrible decay.
The King-street paper just went on shouting
“Hooray !” for Freetrade and land monopoly—
especially for Freetrade. Certainly, in Ireland’s
ease it couldn’t have called it suicide. “Murder”
would more nearly fit that case.
According to Melbourne Age :
Men like the Bents and Swinburnes, with their hollow-
ness of promise and their emptiness of performance, are
the death of political enthusiasm.
The Age might perhaps remedy that to some ex-
tent by doing its best to give Prendergast a
chance of office.
Item from the Workman :
That very Tory person, Henry Dobson, whom Tas-
mania made a Senator in its sleep, interviewed in Eng-
land last month, remarked that “ he was much struck by
the underfed, undersized look of the average man of the
poorer classes, compared with his Australian prototype.”
All the same, Dobson is one of the most riotous advocates
in the Federal Parliament o ; f the system that has made
England what it is, and if the poorer classes in Australia
don’t soon look as underfed and undersized as they do
in the smother country it won’t be Dobson’s fault.

BEHIND INDIGESTION A WEAK
STOMACH
THAT'S THE SOLE CAUSE OF ALL STOMACH ILLS.
SYDNEY WOMAN TELLS How De. WILLIAMS’
PINK PILLS STRENGTRENICD HER STOMACH
TO DIGEST FOOD. UUNTIL CURED, IT LAY ON
HER CHEST LIKE A WEIGHT.
Behind indigestion there’s always a weak
stomach. That’s the trouble in a nutshell: the
stomach can’t do what it ought to do—digest food.
A very delicate stomach requires easily digested
food, but Nature never intended that the food
should be digested before it is eaten. The stomach
must be strengthened to perform its own work
and what it needs is not food already digested but
a tonic. Experience shows that stomach troubles
vanish just as soon as the stomach is made strong
enough to digest the food. It needs a tonic that
will rouse it to do the work of changing the food
into nourishment. The processes of digestion are
controlled by the blood and nerves, and medical
science has produced no better digestive tonic than
Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills. That’s what Dr.
Williams’ Pink Pills did for Mrs. B. Anderson,
81 Gloucester Street, Sydney. Mrs. Anderson
says :
“I used to suffer for years with indigestion.
Some days I couldn’t touch a meal. Other days
I’d be hungry and I’d eat something and suffer
dreadfully after. What I ate just lay on my chest
like a ton weight. I’d think I was suffocating.
I always had a most horrid sour taste in my mouth
and my food was always repeating. I was always
so full of wind in my stomach and round my heart.
I often had to get up in the middle of the night
and walk about, I felt so bloated. I had a queer
pain in my left side. It would be so severe I’d
often have to scream. Many times at night I’d
have to sit up straight in bed because of the
smothering feeling, for I couldn’t draw a full
breath, and in the mornings I’d feel very sick. I’d
get giddy, sick headaches. I was dreadfully low-
spirited and out of sorts. I had no inclination to
do anything. I’d always think something was
going to happen. I shrunk away to half my proper
weight, and had to take in all mv clothes. My
skin was yellow and had quite a shiny look. If I
took a walk I’d have to rest every few minutes, for
my heart would start thumping and fluttering like
mad —I’d gasp for breath just as if I was dying.
At last I thought I’d give Dr. Williams’ Pink
Pills a trial. The second box brought a little relief.
Gradually my food began to digest and the dread-
ful chest pains got less and less. My appetite
came back and by the time I was on the fourth
box I was vastly better. I got brighter and
cheerier. The sick headaches had almost left me.
I got a couple more boxes and improved with
every dose till every symptom passed away for
good and I didn’t need a seventh. My heart calmed
down and I was able to get about and go out for
a long walk. Six boxes of Dr. Williams’ Pink
Pills put me in very good health.”
By their direct action on the blood and nerves,
Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills have cured anaemia,
sciatica, indigestion, paralysis, biliousness, ner-
vousness, headaches, backaches, neuralgia, debility,
rheumatism, and all ailments of women.

I’m the Robur Tea Girl.
Have you ever noticed the
peculiar paper we use to
wrap our tea in? —it is very
strong, perfectly damp-proof
and manufactured expressly for
tea packing. Maybe, you are
not aware that tea needs to be
packed carefully, otherwise it
absorbs dampness from the air,
—it also takes the smell of
anything that may be near it,
and so is spoilt. By packing
Robur tea tightly in our
special parchment paper, the
goodness is kept in and odours
of other goods that may be
stored near it are kept out.
We do not put Robur
up in lead packets, because
there appears to be a suspicion
that tea so packed may not be
good for one. The leaves rub
against the metal (you know
how black your finger will get
if you rub it on lead) —and
thus the lead gets into the
infusion and so may find its
way down the drinker’s throat
—and lead in some' forms is
injurious to human beings.
The following extract from
the Government Analyst of
Western Australia’s report on
Robur tea, whilst appreciating
our method of packing, hints
that to use lead would be
risky. We never take risks.
Perth, W.A.
“The method of packing
is especially advantageous
and ought to commend
itself, for it preserves the
quality and prevents the
danger of lead-poisoning
which might result from
the use of that metal.”
B. 11. WOODWARD,
Government Analyst, W.A.
By the way, you using
Robur? —if not, you ought
to —it is really good tea.
The line which seems to suit
most people for general use
is the No. 2 Grade —it is
wonderfully economical tea.

Is the acme of perfection, and the High-class standard

A WOMAN’S LETTER.
Sydney, September 1, 1908.
My Dear Aiuni,—•
You can’t complain of my giving you at any
time too much gown jourmdism. But during
Fleet week some well-known women wore such
achievements in frocks that their garniture de-
serves to be described in a monograph, or a recital,
or a narration, or some such glorified thing in the
inky thinky way. Instead of getting what they
deserve, two will get the description of one who
saw them on their stands in their respective dress-
creator’s inner temples. For. although I saw
them later on their owners, I didn’t carry away
any circumstantial evidence. One suffers from a
disarray of faculties when surrounded with, say, a
thousand or more beautiful gowns.
First Frock—the one worn by Lady Northcote at the
ball She and He gave to the visiting Eagles : White
chiffon made over white satin, and over the chiffon an
overdress of Italian rose-point lace. Down the front of
the skirt depended a panel of gold braid and tassels, with
tiny pearls sewn on the edges. Drooping over the
shoulders far down the front and hanging down the back
was black Chantilly lace. The sleeves were of tiny pearls.
Modified directoire was the make of the gown. As that
ball was the Northcotes’ last frisk on this continent, her
jewels worn with that gown ought to be allowed a fare-
well coruscation in this par. A diamond tiara, a diamond
dog-collar, a single-stone diamond necklace, a diamond
and pink tourmaline ornament, on the front of the cor-
sage more diamonds and tourmalines making one lumi-
nary, and over each shoulder a milky way of diamonds,
diamond hair comb and sundry other glittering gems
made the lady blaze like a stellar system.
When she faced the God Save of the band at the Mayor
and Mayoress Hughes’ reception, the night after her ball,
her Ex’s gown was of grey chiffon over silver tissue
with glass-bead insertion. Panel down the front was
yellow chiffon with bows of Tangerine velvet.
Frock 11. : At the Hughes reception, on Mad Wednes-
day night, Mrs. J. 0- Williamson scored with an Empire
gown of dull gold Liberty satin, with a tunic of gold-
spotted net heavily embroidered in cream and golden
floss silk. The trains of these accurately-cut robes
huddle into funny little narrow tails that soon get twists
in them as the wearer moves about in the madding crowd.
The foot of the skirt is weighted with a row of lead
buttons.
It was no exaggeration to say the Town Hall
“presented a brilliant appearance.” It never
looked more brilliantined. There was a happy
absence of bunting, and the only decorations were
the ropes of greenery and the ropes of electric
lights that illuminated the greenery and out-
lined the 1C arches of the hall. “Even your
architecture,” said Captain G. Brospero Trolly-
wav, “contrives to do our 1G vessels honor.”
The view from the gallery, when some 3000 persons
covered the floor as with a moving parquetry, was
polychromatic —beat the spectrum into a dull
drab. It might also be said to beat the band.
One person went further and said that it banged
Bannagher. The Mayoress, always a first-rate
dresser, shone in orange, gold and kingfisher blue,
and was burdened with a lily of the valley posy.
The Joseph’s Coat scheme of things, the scores of
heavily gilded officers, and the scarlet runner
clothes of some of our Yictoria Barracks boys
didn’t overwhelm all the all-white (clad)
Australians present. Mrs. Colman Burke glit-
tered like a Polar night in heavily silvered and
frosted white. (N.B. —I’ve only the word of
divers poets that a Polar night does glitter. I
once knew a Polar bear—he just growled.) Mrs.
State Premier Wade was like unto a smoke-wreath
in a mole-hued fabric. Mrs. Croker, of Mel-
bourne, one of the best-gowned, trailed a Rose du
Barri satin with meanderings of raised flowers.
The emerald greens present —there were only a
few of them —screamed from the throng at the
guests in the gallery. All the same, emerald is a
glorious night color, especially for blondes and
mezzos. Miss Eva O’Sullivan’s frock was one of
the screamers, and two green quills yelped in her
hair. Mrs. Julius Caro’s glitter of black and steel
also helped to lift its wearer out of the general iri-
descence and make her a special glory all on her
own. Mrs. Foster, the consort of the dismal-looking
colonel who professes military science from a Chair
at the Uni., has been an eye-arresting figure in
the society whirl of last week. She is a very tall
edition of Miss Beatrice Day, and wears yellow to
harmonise with her daffodil hair, and black to con-
trast with the same. Two “ Town-Clerk” Nesbitt
girls glimmered prettily in white samite. (Don’t
know what samite is, but doubtless the drapers
stock it, and surely King Arthur hadn’t a mo-
nopoly of it.)
Recurring to the ball: It was a beautiful ball,
and the lights didn’t fail till within two rounds —
I mean two dances—of the end of the programme.
Those were the dances that didn’t. They are yet
undanced. The Irrational Anthem was played
twice as an intimation to the dancers to get en
route. The first of the two missed dances was,
by the way, the en route polka, and the
second was a galop. “ Marvellous, marvellous” as
the man says in “The Red Mill.” The throng
did gallop into the rainy night. The reason why
I recurred to the ball was to spend an ink-drop on
the chiffon collars that a few women wore. These
collars are an adaptation of Sara Bernhardt’s wear
—the neck corset. One who speaks with
authority, and not as the scribes, told me they
were dog-collars—chiffon dog-collars. My dog
doesn’t wear a chiffon collar. In fact, I have never
seen a dog with his neck swathed tightly in tucked
chiffon or untearable tulle with a diamond spray
in front. One lady wore a black neck
corset without any jewel relief, but it
showed up her terrifying pallor too markedly.
Mrs. Sep. Levy also had an emerald green neck
zone with a diamond splash on it. Her emerald
green frock, foliaged with gold leaves, was one of
the masterpieces at the dress show.
At Mad Wednesday night’s reception Mrs.
Walter Hall’s jewels blinded the guests in the
gallery. On her head, which would have been all
the better for eighteen penn’orth of professional
hairdressing, she wore a big circle with upstand-
ing suns. And her neck and shoulder clothing of
cold diamonds made one realise how rich Mount
Morgan is, and how rich also it has been.
A well-dressed young married woman, with
pink corals and a small waist, tells this herself :
On her third meeting with Admiral Sperry (day
before he left Sydney), she asked him who, of all
the persons he had met here, would he, if he had
the power, take back with him to his own country.
She put the idiotic query while doing boudoir
tricks with her eyes. Instead of replying, in a
voice charged with emotion, “You, dear lady,”
the distinguished salt answered instantly, in
level tones, “Mr. Share.” That reply has raised
Sperry as high as his own masthead in the estima-
tion of those who’ve heard of it. And if the
Dudley potentate doesn’t by-and-bye secure Mr.
Share for Australia, and rope him in after lie’s
had his well-earned holiday with the Northcotes —
I’m afraid we won’t love the potentate as well as
we might.
Commander Grant, chief of Admiral Sperry’s
staff, was here 24 years ago on the old Iroquois,
and stayed in our waters some three weeks.
The aides of the four American Admirals were
assigned a cottage detached from Government
House, while the high quartet stayed at the
mansion itself. On taking possession rather late
at night the aides found every comfort and con-
venience except something to mix with the
large quantity of hot and cold water that had
been provided. They looked vainly on shelves
and in sideboards for the missing link. Finally,
word was sent to Government House that there
was a live snake in a wash-basin, and they wanted
something to poison it with. Down came a
couple of varlets with clubs and an arsenal of
knives and revolvers. When the Truth was dis-
covered there was a swift hurrying of distilled
grain and of things that popped and fizzed to the
snake-infested area.
American sailors have spent money so freely in
Sydney that report says they must have a “spend-
ing bonus.” Every shop that sold postcards did
an immense trade. A partial set of band instru-
ments was bought at a music warehouse for £l5O.
But the U.S. will foot that bill. I saw two young
lieutenants in a drapery, buying a trimmed hat
and “ a separate ostrich feather.” They showed
no embarrassment at the work, and it was sinful
the way they were overcharged for the feather.
After postcards the sailors’ fancy ran to feather-
buying, and a Pitt-street plumage-emporium was
crowded with Jackies the whole of the crowded
week. A suburban milliner “might,” to use
her own phrase, “ have been knocked down
with a quill ” when three of her young appren-
tices told her they were following the squadron
to Melbourne, and would want a week’s leave.
‘ ‘ Who is paying your passages ? ” she gasped to
the half-a-crown-a-weekers. “Three gentlemen
of the Fleet,” was the reply. The “ three gentle-
men’’came into the battery one morning, and
were enthusiastically introduced to the Head.
They were calm, modest young ordinary sailors.
“This taking my girls to Melbourne,” said the
lady, “is a strange proceeding. Do you
mean to get engaged to them?” “Why, cer-
tainly not, mahm. But they’ve not seen
Melbourne, and we reckoned we might
give them a good time and no one be
any the worse. Why, mahm, it may be that we
won’t be able to get shore-leave there at all; but
as long as we put up the dollars the young ladies
will be able to look around. ” It was pure altruism.
Five white-posy bearers, robed all in white,
“ came out ” at the Northcotes’ Ball—Miss Nellie
Campbell, one of the Deas Thompson family,
Miss Marjorie Lawford, Miss Eileen MacCabe,
who is related to some of the Osborne clan, and
Miss Isaacs, daughter of High Court Justice
Isaacs.
The Five Albatrosses, as the American wives
are now called, followed the Fleet to Melbourne,
but are due back here on Thursday. Then they
embark for Japan in the same steamer by which
go the Northcotes and Captain Share, and will
strike the Armada again in Yellow waters.
Seven hundred is the full roll of spoons abducted
from the Connecticut. The subject is too painful
for further mention.
Mr. T. B. Dibbs is acting as consul for Sweden
while the real goods. Count Morner, is off on a
four months’ visit to Europe. The Count has one
of the finest collection of Napoleonic literature
and relics in the world, but Sydney will remember
him best by the snake luncheon he gave some
ladies at the Australia. The snakes were alive,
but probably drugged, and as each cover was lifted
the guests saw snakes.
The recently-knighted Hay and Carruthers
•wanderers are on their way back in the Miltiades,
due here in a week or so. The handsome dress-
designer, who has been in foreign capitals at the
instance of a big Sydney firm, and who was re-
turning by the India, had to go ashore at Colombo,
seriously ilk Lord Richard Nevill “took
notice,” for the first time since his return, by
going to “ Peter Pan ” with the Northcotes and
the Poore lady. Ada Crossley is due at Fremantle
on the 12th. Mr. Claude MKay will act as her
pilot-fish.
The signatures of the several hundred persons
who put their names in the farewell presentation
album to Lady Northcote would make an interest-
ing study for those who profess to judge character
hy handwriting. There are all sorts and conditions
of inky ways about well-known women. One
leader of society, whose weight would make a camel
sag down in the middle, signs as if with a hair nib
dipped in watered ink; while the boldest signa-
ture of the lot is that of fragile little Margaret
Gordon. It looks like the lettering for a poster
billhead of her singing days. “Helen Ashton,”
and “ Minnie Forbes Angus,” and a “Playfair”
signature are also uncommon. The album is a real
gem. The 12 sheets of signatures carry water-
color sketches by Misses Ethel Stephen, Alice
Norton, McWhannel, Yaile, and Gladys Owen.
The last is a grand-daughter of Mr. Justice Owen.
The covers are of silver repousse work, carried out
by some of the arts and crafts girls.
Norland Institute got some funds last week, by
means of a very successful ball. That pair of
untiring, though tired, workers, Miss Rawson
and Mayoress Hughes, did the right thing, by
their respective positions. Mrs. Greig Smith, the
founder of the Institute, Mrs. Rutter, Mrs.
Warren, Mrs. W. Chisholm, and a long queue of
mere medical men’s consorts did likewise.
Mrs. G. H. Reid’s hand-painted, chiffon
directoire frock, with the gold clasp at the waist—
—the frock’s waist—-was one of the best of hun-
dreds of lovelv gowns at the Rawsons’ garden
party. Yes-No’s consort has within the last few
years burgeoned out into the most artistic of
frockers.
Here is a romance in which figure a sub-
ject of the Kaiser and a Neutral Bay girl.
She (Miss Vera Borchardt) went a-visiting
to her father’s country some months ago. A man
met her, loved, proposed and was rejected. He
had never been unsuccessful in business schemes
in his life, and he wasn’t taking refusals. So he fol-
lowed her about. Constant following makes the hard
heart softer. She said “Yes.” His engagement
tokens to her were (1) a £4OO ring ; (2) a villa, (3)
a forest! It’s the forest that fetches the note of
exclamation. He is a millionaire, it seems, and
forests are some of his assets.
The callow female of these parts is engaged just
now, silently or verbosely, as her temperament
directs, adoring Tommy Brusso Burns. Wher-
ever the Gibson-man pugilist goes during his train-
ing walks abroad, he leaves a trail of sloppy
female hearts in his wake. They love him in
that he is “amass of brawn and muscle.” The
thought of being crushed in his bear-like strangle-
hold is an ecstasy. It is a humiliating time for
the local young man. By taking singing lessons
and learning to recite, he was able to persuade him-
self even though he so became in reality a
public nuisance in the eyes of others —that
he was on a level with the best of the adored males
of stageland. But Thomas, the annihilator of
giants, is a different proposition. Each shop
window reflects for the benefit of the heart-sick,
indigenous Romeo the awful discrepancy between
his paltry quota of brawn and that of Bill Squires
friend and basher. There is no way out of it.
Physical culture, even if harsh employers had the
decency to permit it during four or five hours
daily, would not avail. All that is possible is to
suggest darkly that Thomas wears stuffing
amongst his under garments, and for the rest to
wait and hope against hope that the too
alluring stoush merchant will go right away
shortly and never return, and that his very
memory may, in course of time, fade and fade till
it becomes a cloud no bigger than a clerk’s inkpot
in the mighty firmament of love.
The Due de Broglie—the name needs no ex-
planation of identity—is said to have been in
Sydney last week with his private sec. Anyhow,
the Maorilanders say he has been touring their
long island and that he is on his way to Asiatic
ports.
Miss Madge Suttor (daughter of Francis, of
the lovely calves) is to be married next Monday
to Mr. Hughes, a tea-planter from some Asian
address.
The Lachlan Beatons and Miss Ruby Adams
have left Paris for Freiburg, in Germany, to get
out of the August heat. Marchesi stopped teach-
ing in July and starts again in September. When
the Australian party was getting its trunks
through the Customs in France the official asked
where they were from. “ Australia,” he was
told. “O',” he smiled. “Pays du kangaroo
drdle.” And he passed them without scrutiny.
Apparently the humorous kangaroo is a popular
beast, and when you mention his name he helps
you a lot.
It is told, on poor authority, that the first
pressman who scaled the walls of the American
flagship asked of the first sailor he met : “Has
the Admiral gone off yet?” and got the reply .
“No; but he will when he sees some of the
decorations.” Also is the yarn told that in Auck-
land there was reared over the door of the gaol a
huge “Welcome” in electric lights, and that the
Aucklanders didn’t notice the mistake until after
the visitors had left.
“ Mario ” writes from Brisbane :
We have a new Casabianea on deck. The aged but
stalwart gentleman who carries the title of aoting-Pre-
mier being away at Yarra Bank, Fleeting with his missus,
our sprightly Attorney-General is left to decorate
the burning deck of the State ship. Mrs. Bell’s
absence is felt a little by that strange, nebulous body
that calls itself the National Council of Women, of
whom she is the president. They had to have their
annual festivities without her, but with true magna-
nimity they re-elected her. There was one bright spot in
the evening meeting, when Dr. W. S. Byrne read
a paper, which pointed out the loss of infant life in
the State, showed the simple remedy, and held up to
the clod of ridicule those authorities who spend thousands
in protecting stock from disease, but who allow the infant
population, of which Queenslandhas such urgent need, to
die off rather than provide £2OOO a year for the produc-
tion of a eow-juiCe that is something more than chalk and
water.
Brisbane is about to wave its final farewell to the North-
cotes, and Government House leads the way on the 10th
with a garden party, to which many are bidden. Other
functions are in contemplation, and there will be, of
course, the usual wholesale banquet, with a balcony from
which women will see their husbands, fathers, brothers,
and uncles ruining their digestions. Incidentally, there
will be organ music and ice-creams.
The sad death of Mr. Harry Beriiavs followed closely
upon his father’s decease. Mr. Bernays was yet another
victim of the idiocies of architects who build windows low
enoug'h to be walked out of and no balcony outside to
step on. He was just setting his house in order, with a
view to marrying a bonny girl of your State, which
makes it all the more shocking'. Old man Bernays was a
unique figure in the city, and his demise leaves a gap in
Queensland history. He was loaned by the Ma State to
Queensland to start its baby Parliament, because he was
one walking mass of procedure and infallible on points
of order and disorder. He was Clerk of Parliament to the
day of his death, a courtly, kindly old gentleman of the
old school, wearing a monocle and a cut-away coat. Up
to the day before his death he seemed hale and durable.
His sudden and painless passing leaves A. W. Compigne
as the sole survivor of the first Queensland Legislative
Council.
Mrs. Gerald Gore, Miss Bernays, and Mr. Fitz Bernays
are three of the deceased gentleman's children well known
in the South.
Another grievous affair was the sudden passing - out of
Mrs. Williams, of Jondaryan station. She met her death
through a buggy accident whil * on a visit to her son-in-
law, Mr. J. Graham, at Esk. Mrs. Williams was a Miss
White, and old man White was a pioneer cow-and-sheep
driver and ox-persuader in the early ’fifties.
Tennis has been occupying - the attention of the exclus-
ive during the past few days. Now that the New South
Wales players have departed homeward with a well-
spl-cterl assortment of electro-plate for their glory boxes,
thing's have suffered something of a slump, and, bat a
little show of verbal fireworks, nothing- of stupendous in-
terest has occurred. The fireworks alluded to seem to be
generated by jealousy, and are chiefly directed against a
smart young pair whose dandy parties and evident con-
tentmentwith each other, to the exclusion of small affairs,
seem to greatly harass those individuals who look
earnestly through the keyhole in the hope of finding out
their neighbor’s iniquity.
Yours Affectionately,
AKENEHI.

Great Fleet has on board
sixteen Pianola Pianos.
They were purchased from
the Pianola Company with
funds raised by the men and
officers for amusement
purposes.
The committees appointed
from the various ships to
select Piano Players con-
tained men who were speci-
ally chosen because they
were experts in the fine
points of mechanical con-
struction.
The notable unanimity
with which these various
committees selected the
Pianola Piano from among;
its many imitators is equally
a tribute to the instrument
itself and to the gfood
judg;ment of the men who
constitute the American
Navy.

MELBOURNE CHATTER.
Melbourne, August 31, 1908.
My Dear Yarrie, —
Sydney Harbor made for much beauty of
picture grouping for the Fleet boats, and probably
gave keenest pleasure to the sea-comers. But
Port Phillip, from its very severity and dignity
of space, gave a grand air for impressive entry.
There was room for the whole outfit to get in line
and yet give each ship as much room for its digni-
fied sweep as a court-trained curtseying countess.
It was the grand entry —the dignified ballet. A
girl leaning over the rail of a welcoming boat near
me said, “ Isn’t it pretty ! ” Pretty ! These mon-
sters gliding past, with more terrorin their big, grey
silence than in thunder. Some people would think
the Trump of Doom “such a nice tune.”
“If these were ours ” w r as everybody’s thought as
each quiet tower shadowed past. Nevertheless,
there was a reviving thought in the fact that
every one of these visiting sixteen steel arks is
quite new—that the Fleet was born in a night, so
to speak, and in another night another fleet
may be born also. If the lesson goes home much
can be done in a short time.
All the small craft—the welcoming boats with
their clothes-lines of colored pocket-handkerchiefs
and their respective bands blaring disconnected
and disharmonious shades of “Star Spangled
Banner”—dodged in and out of the white line like
so many inquisitive mosquitoes, but each warboat
dipped its colors with never a smile and not a
squirm. It is a most courteous, graceful bow—
that dipping the colors.
Sperry is a man of minute punctuality. The
Governor-crowd, welcoming from St. Kilda pier
head, thought he was going to be half-a-second
late, but he wasn’t. It was the slickest thing.
The boats had scarcely dropped anchor before a
dozen or more smart little launches were scatter-
ing off like a clutch of white chickens. The
Admiral’s launch is a dandy thing of white and
brass and hustle. It fairly raced for the far-off
pier, and landed his lace-ship on the tick of the
appointed moment.
What amused me was the get-to-work hustle of
the sailors. Immediately the anchor was dropped
—even before the launches had time to scuttle off
—some sailors had hung out platforms and were
busy painting the sides of their battleboat.**
At the very genesis of things (in Melbourne, I
mean) the United States officers are bucking at
the blessed State functions. It is formality from
first to last. Sperry says : “ Twenty of you go to
the So-and-so reception, and thirty go to the
What-is-it blow out.” “Why, darn it,” wail the
officers (at least I suppose they do ; I know I have
seen the expression in United States novels)
“ where’s our shore leave? Why can’t we spend
one formal day in correct kow-tow, then get off
and whoop up a good time where we please ?”
One of the down-the-bay-to-meet-the-Fleet
parties has left the host pondering. He is a
bachelor of means who chartered a small steamer
and picked out some select society plums as guests.
All the magnificence at his command was spread
for liis guests, but two damsels and two naval
officers descended into the bowels of the boat and
steadily played Bridge all through the pageant.
They played the whole time and acted as ballast.
“ Thanks so much for a lovely day,” chortled the
card fiends, and the flabbergasted host wondered
why he had spent a small fortune per hour to
entertain and benefit people who might just as
well have been left on a cattle-truck.
The town is full of rare birds —the weird eagles
one might expect to see in a dream of late suppers.
One of the daily papers seemed to be part owner
of a clothes-line which stretched across Collins-
street, and from, that line dangled a hybrid
chooky of a really terrible character. But its
owners backed down with ruffled indignity and
hauled the disgraceful fowl out of sight in the small
hours of the morning—and all because the rude
opposition paper guffawed in a paragraph. So
the United States officers never saw that hanged
bird. The danglement was gone before they
entered the Bay.
Margaret Anglin was invited to Sunday’s lunch
on every boat in the Fleet. She is a clever woman,
but her capabilities end at one lunch at a time,
however fascinating the hosts. The naval men
recognised this, but the Louisiana stole a march.
The commander of that boat (she’s a sister ship to
the Connecticut) sent Matthews, the press repre-
sentative who travelled with them, ahead by
train. He spent the evening about Her Majesty’s
until he got an opportunity of personally handing
over the Louisiana dinner card and getting an
acceptance.
Miss Anglin says she used to know a great
many of “the Boys” at one time, when she “was
located ”in St. Johns, Canada. Her popper was
a prominent politician, also a journalist, and
editor of the Freeman’s, a St Johns paper. Sister
Eileen is blossoming out on the mummer path.
Shecame firstof all merely to companion her sister.
Then Mr. Williamson gave her an engagement,
and she was to play in everything of the Anglin-
Australian repertoire except “The Thief.”
But she has got into “The Thief,” too;
for toward the end of last week, when Miss Susie
Vaughan broke down with a serious throat illness,
the Eileen sister took her part more than creditably
on very brief and sawn-off notice.
The Australian Literature Society feels so in-
fluential that it has no intention of knocking off
its usual recital even in Fleet week. Mr. Graham
Weir, backed up by a Chief Justice and a senator
or so, will give what is mysteriously labelled “a
musical and whimsical corroboree ” of poetry—
eucalyptus brand—on this Thursday-of-the-Stars-
and-Stripes. If the admirals of the armada want
any poetical corroboree as a gentle antidote to the
effects of review and agricultural show, they will
doubtless be admitted free to the front seats on
production of their cocked hats.
A recent gorgeous dance, given by some social
lights who aspire to h u ' te 60-candle-power, is
gruesomely spoken of as the Wake. A near rela-
tive, a busy business man, was inconsiderate
enough to depart this life most unexpectedly, not
only after the invitations were out, but when even
the chooks were done brown, and the florist was
pegging away at the garlands, and the jellies were
at their most perishable point. So the revel was
allowed to swing on its frantic way on the evening
The Bulletin recently remarked on the excel-
lence of certain Australian-made cinematograph films,
conspicuous among which were those of the Marcus
Clarke drama, “For the Term of His Natural Life.”
Other notable examples were “Robbery Under Arms,”
and, lastly, the Burns-Squires championship fight. All
these films were the work of the pioneers of the business
in Australia, Jerdan’s Limited, of 893 George-street.
“For the Term of His Natural Life’’ran to 30(J0ft. ;
“ Robbery Under Arms ” to 4000 ft.; while the “scrap ”film
was over half-a-mile in length. The bruising ended about
4.40 p.m. Monday afternoon, and the whole distance was
handed over to Messrs. McMahon and Carroll for exhibi-
tion on Wednesday,'and was shimmering across the screen
that night. For rapidity of workmanship and excellence
of finish the Australian cinematograph film makers are
of the day when brother-in-law had carefully
avoided breaking the speed limit as he drove to
the City o£ Cypress and Sighs. The sadness of
the sad event was mitigated, so to speak, by the
polka, and the galop cheered up the tombstone, as
one might put it.
Medico Stawell and his bride managed to dodge
the final congratulations of their fraternity on
their wedding day last week. The wedding was
to be built for two and the witnesses, but mur-
murs reached the two who were going to be one
flesh of secret high jinks planned for the send-off,
so they rose to the occasion. Having announced
the wedding hour, they motored to St. Andrew’s
three hours ahead of time, and scrambled
through their solemn promises under the
eyes of a sister or so and best-man Hamilton
Russell. The scent of some fading scarlet
carnations and a sprig of orange blossom
were all that remained to the fossicking Faculty
bent on being witnesses if not guests. Wonderful
how these wise men are afraid of being observed
to get married, and still more wonderful how they
persuade the heroine to sympathise with their
terrors!
Rush worth has been rising to great heights for
a small country town in farewelling its favorite
nice girl, Miss Nettie Anderson. She is to be
married in the historical Fleet week to one
Coyle, well-known to Bendigo’s Golden City.
Lord Dicky Nevill has arrived clothed in con-
tradictions. Alternately he has been announced
as Chief Chamberlain (or somewhere thereabout),
Aide-de-Camp-in-excelsis, and now merely as a
Visitor of State for the Celebrations. But surely
we are going to have our Dicky for keeps ?
On the so-called departure of the Northcote
Governor, one of the addresses hurled at him was
from that go-ahead young institution, the College
of Dentistry. The ex-G.G. wrote a courteous
reply to the University of Teeth, and expressed
his gratification. All the same, he didn’t godown to
the college and have a tooth stopped as a sign of
goodwill. That new Hospital of Dentistry is one
of the most humane institutions in Melbourne,
but it is a gruesome exhibition scene.
A foolish boy-and-girl love affair has just cul-
minated in a divorce. The divorced husband has
managed to crowd material for two exciting novels
into his few grown-up years. Before he was out of
Law’s infancy he married a girl even younger than
himself. She died after a few months’honeymoon.
The bereft bridegroom spent even fewer months in
widowerhood, and dashed into a second trial of
matrimonywithabuddingdebutante—a wide-eyed,
fair-haired girl who had scarcely grown out of
short frocks and the pigtail that hangeth down the
spine. Now the cut-asunder loves have uncovered
and shown nakedly to the public eye a frayed
and tattered cat-and-dog tale. The young wife
has won her liberty—the shreds of liberty left to
a girl in her very early twenties with the weary
eyes of a woman of 40.
“The Kilties” have roused a de’il of astir in Mel-
bourne, what with giants who glance into third-
storey windows and look down chimneys as they
do the Block, and a piper who gazes as super-
ciliously over half-an-acre of gold medal as if he
had just beaten Tommy Burns in half-a-round.
Some busbied, bare-legged aristocrats conde-
scended to play “The Star Spangled Banner”
on one of the Parliamentary boats that
scuttled down to the Heads to watch the
Grand March. One important night at the Exhi-
bition performance of skirl and toe-tap, the show
drum-majors (who top their Bft. of flesh and
porridge with ten-inch busbies) turned our Im-
pressive Ones into a ridiculous Lilliputian colony.
The giants acted as convoy to the great ones of
the city up the aisle and into the specially-
cushioned seats. Our curveful Premier merely
spun his way up like a small top, while his
daughter and small fair niece gave themselves
chi-onic crick in the neck trying to locate the
Voice that led.
There were some laboriously thought-out cos-
tumes at the Vie. Artists’ ball on Saturday night.
A Dulcie Deamer heroine (at least that’s what
she looked like) arrested and gaoled the
eye for some considerable time; so did a
male person garbed with perfect correct-
ness in the likeness of Rudyard Kipling.
A huge black bear turned out at unmasking,
not to be Tummus Bent in disguise, but the son
of one known to most Vic. artists—to wit, Laurie
Abraham. Amongst the masquers who pointed
the sprightly toe were “Kodak’s” two literary
sisters, Laura Archer (“ Bushwoman ”) and Nance
O’Ferrall (“ Bohemienne”). Miss Nance w r as
garbed as an early snowdrop, just up for the
spring, and the Bushwoman was a lady of Spanish
extraction, and looked it.
A friend of mine, who is in Tgh Life and stays
at the Hotel Cecil in Bullopolis, sends me a few
jottings on the sacred uotepaper, thus
Mr. and Mrs. Janies McEvoy are staying here. Missus
is looking just as sweet as ever, which is gratifying. Miss
Kita Kiddle, the Australian gilded sheepy girl, was
having tea here one day. I saw her also at Lady Dudley’s
reception ; she was the smartest girl there. Saw Mrs.
Landale (the Melbourne beauty who married her cousin)
and sister-in-law (Miss Landale) in Hyde Park, for church-
parade, on Sunday. They were smart, and had hats
quite the size of a 40-acre paddock, which went one ahead
of Lady Dazzle, a society woman here, who always has
twelve footmen to balance her hat. Miss Elorrie Binnie—
one of the Chevy Chase Binnies of Brighton—was there
too ; her hat was a minor matter, and showed her fair
hair. Lady Doughty I met at the Exhibition ; she looks
much thinner than when I saw her in Australia. At
Newmarket I saw the wealthy cattle-Kidman, admiring
the horses ; he was with Peter Mitchell and his wife.
Peter is one of the Sydney Mitchells, who has just married
a New' York girl. He bought several horses at the sale
after the races, and is shipping them to Australia. I also
saw Duncan McCrae, of Westralia, at the races. One
bumps into Australians everywhere in London in the
season. I met several I know' at the opera, and saw Jack
Dane and his new wife in Regent-street.
A youth who helps considerably as a corner
stone in holding up The Block, and entertains
other Blockheads with tales of his “connections,”
has lost some of his social standing in Collins-
street. The poor young gentleman tv as “told to
go,” or words to that effect, at the most whirly
height of a certain ball—and all because he was
there without invitation.
A near-to-Melbourne nunnery had a razzle
recently that the Sisters wot not of. Some
scholars of the nuns’ academy asked permission
to go to a theatre matinee. The request was
firmly refused. It was a half-holiday, and the
boldest of the maiden spirits planned a lawless
expedition. The whole class hid its hat under its
frock and crept out. Some got through the gate ;
some climbed the wall and fell over and bumped
their noses. But the scramble was successful, and
the crowd treated itself to a shilling’s-worth among
the gods of heathenesse.
Melbourne’s very last word in dandy sub-
urban balls will be the La Crosse, which homes at
Hawthorn. “Twenty American and ten British
officers” are a trumpeted attraction, outshining the
minor lights of Chief Justice Madden and Plain
Justice This and Senator That. The LaCrosse
boys have a knack of striking the Lion when it is
hot They mostly capture something with a
Hambourg lias taken root in Melbourne. His re-
puted farewell recitals go on and On and on in rhyth-
mic three-times-a-week cycles like unto the stolid,
planted hurdy-gurdy that waits for the penny,
and refuses to leave off turning the handle unless
the coin is forthcoming. Is it the harvest of Fleet
country crowds he garners, or do the truffles and
champagne of applause hold the hairling to the
Hall of Draughts?
From “Rosna,”in Adelaide, which feels hurt
because it isn’t to have a chance to say “ Howdy ? ”
to Ad. Sperry :
Mark Hambourg pounced upon the piano at Adelaide
Town Hall on August 25, and we’ve never heard another
piano howl and shriek as that one did. It fought Mark
for about 150 rounds, Marquis of Scuffleberry rules. He
stroked it down a little at last and a partial calm set in,
but I believe that piano is secretly mobilising its forces,
and when it attacks Mr. Hambourg suddenly some dark
night there will be a tragedy. 1 had a half-uncle once
who was rushed from behind on a lonely road by a mad
piano weighing 16cwt. that had tracked him from a
distant town, and he was never quite the same again.
His name was Smith—l don’t know why. Their musical
Exes, with Miss Clowes and an aide, the Way dame
and Mrs. Herbert Bymill, adorned the front chairs
on the great Hambourg night. Another heavenly
circumstance thereabouts was Mrs. Mark, of the
beauteous complexion, in some traily confection, with
furs to make any cat jealous. The audience was large
and profound, and of a greed that passeth all satisfying.
The matinCe next day was given over to a Chopin
recital; and Adelaide still mentions the “ A flat Ballade ”
with bated breath and the lights turned down. The
audience was once more large and greedy ; and when the
show was over, as on the night before, an excited crowd
hung on to the Hambourg carriage, saying excited thanks
to the contents.
Great preparations are going forward in the Muecke
home to welcome the illustrious Crossley daughter-in-
law and the medico son. In fact, all Adelaide is feeling
rather perky about Ada. It’s not every day the Tram
State has a celebrity-in-law to feel perky about. From
the junketings in contemplation, the lady’s stay is likely
to be a red-letter period—with green stripes to represent
the attitude of mind of those who are not invited. In
the Crossley train come the Richard Nitchskes, also
aforetime of these parts. They now dwell in Britain, to
which island Richard sings in a baritone martner.
Adelaide’s bachelor Mayor, Frank Johnson, continues
to spend his shekels on the populace. Last week he gave
a concert for the citizens, and a band and a batch of local
warblers played and sang classic and other ditties to the
jammed Town Hall.
Kubelik was persuaded to hear Daisy Kennedy, an
Adelaide fiddler-girl, and he handed her so much
encouragement that her friends are proceeding to buy a
ticket for her Europewards. The damsel holds a Con-
servatoire scholarship ; but the gist of the Kubelik advice
was of the go-at-once-delay-is-fatal order ; so apparently
the tail-end of the scholarship will be thrown to as
many winds no happen to be blowing at the time.
Miss Kennedy has been brought up to her fiddle
since infancy, is technically good, and has a promising
appearance and plenty of confidence, She owes the
Kubelik notice to the kind offices of Manager C. A. John-
ston, late of the Harbor City, who heard her play, and
Captured the wizard’s interest for her. He it was who
also discovered Eva Mylott.
There is great excitement because an aforetime Ade-
laide society girl, Jean Martin, is in the cast of “ The
Scarlet Pimpernel,” under the eyes of Julius Super-
humanus himself. The nice girl is one of the Gawler
Martins, and a sister of Mrs. Harry Dutton, whose hus-
band has just tooted across the continent in his motor.
Adelaide is becoming a fearful and dangerous village to
dwell in, with masked villains stalking about if at the
dead of night. Three of them seized and bound a night-
watchman while they robbed the Unley tramsheds ; then
they let him go and'told him to be wise and not give the
alarm for half-an-hour. Then some more bailed up a
tame and unoffending mailcart, searched it, and let it go.
Weirdest of all was the experience of the damsel who was
riding her bike in a quiet suburb in broad daylight, casu-
ally carrying £l5 worth of jewellery in a bag on her arm.
Suddenly a man shot up, grabbed the bag and shot down
again, and he and the jewellery have not been heard of
since. , ~ , ,
While “ The Merry Widow ” was in Adelaide, Andrew
Higginson got tipped off his steed, and landed on his
beautiful head ; and he was thereby incapacitated for
several nights, much to the agitation of a heap of Girl.
One way and another, Adelaide seems something of a
snare and a hoodoo to the comic-opera artist. Last time
it was Gouriet who smashed his ankle, and before that
Olive Godwin caught appendicitis, or some other ’ifcis, and
had to wait till a brace of doctors chased the little wretch
to its lair.
Yours affectionately,
JOHANNA.

Frances Newport, of Melbourne, the only
lady in Australia who is legal manager of a mining
co., was tried, last week, in a neat-fitting blouse
and a nice hat, on a charge of embezzlement, and
acquitted. There was certainly a shortage in the
cash, but, according to the evidence, the sanguine
company had sold shares on credit and hadn’t got
the money, vet, feeling sure it would get the
money, had included the amount among its assets,
and had otherwise discounted the future and put
the rainbow up the spout, so to speak. Of course,
when a new auditor, who didn’t regard the rain-
bow as an asset, came along and wanted to see
the actual cash, there was trouble. But what
earthly use has a gold-mining company for an
auditor who wants to see the actual cash every
time, and who won’t regard the bright hopes of
the future as an asset ?
The power of memorising their lines seems to weaken
sooner in the more intellectual actors and actresses than
in the common or mumming sort.. George Rignold
wanted the prompter’s aid before he began to be an old
man ; Irving likewise. Ellen Terry’s defective memory
has been the cause of humorous incidents for years past,
and now her sister, Marion Terry, is uncertain of hei
words—so very uncertain that the audience hears a good
many of them communicated to her.
Melbourne Political Labor Council de-
clined all invitations to the Fleet festivities for
three foolish reasons: (1) That the money being
spent upon the Fleet reception could be much
better applied to provide relief for the unem-
ployed ; (2) that the executive should take no
action that would appear to “ countenance mili-
tarism”; and (3) that the Fleet represented
Capital. The coin this country spends (shift-
ing it mainly from one pouch to another)
on entertaining a friendly white nation is
well spent if the visit of the Fleet affords
Australia a stimulus and an example. And the
old fallacy that Capital and Labor are the only
foes in the world will receive a sudden shock
when some Asiatic invader, who doesn’t worry
much about Political Economy, lifts his head and
belches a few tons of sulphur over the scenery.
The Jap or Chow, when he arrives, won’t shake
friendly hands with the local toiler. He will toss
him out of his job. He won’t understand the
fellow-worker feeling at all.
The company which was formed in Sydney
to fish for that gilded myth or sea-serpent, the
“Page Millions,” woundup last week. G. H.
Morris, the claimant, still preserves some shreds
of faith in the vision, and goes back to England
to race after the shadow some more. He won’t
lack for company in the hunt, for the dream
about lost estates and unclaimed millions
colors the lives of many oddments of humanity in
Australia. The writer once knew a family so
possessed by the idea that its members just
scrapped along from day to day on odd farming
jobs, convinced always that the next mail from
Bullopolis would bring definite news of fortune.
“ Disinterested relatives,” those chimerical beings
who serve the unsophisticated, were “hurrying
things along,” so the old man said. The eldest
daughter talked with glowing eyes of yachting on
the Mediterranean and other high-class and special
diversions, and claimed the writer's assistance in
designing her first Court gown. The dream lasted
for years, and is probably still straggling along
after some members of the family. The eldest
daughter married an expert professional derelict,
also with a vision in Chancery. He now views
life mainly through the latter end of pub glass-
ware, while she sees future honors through the
steam of the omnipresent wash tub. And there
are many such.

„ a / ls ? folk where to go, or rather to give a hint
to r.f dlrec tion their travels ought to take,
ough the hint, if given sufficient expression, may
end up by becoming a loud intimation. There is
no te.ling. Things intended often happen. That
sounds hke a proverb, but these remarks have to
switch on to Adelaide, which, for some time before
lately, has been the capital of South Australia,
xney will therefore do so.
JNow Adelaide, as some inquisitive people have
ound out, can be reached in two easy and com-
WnW WayS ’ Y 1 severaI uneasy and uncom-
rtable ones. Of the two easy ways, one is per
oa.,, the other per train. Of the several uneasy
ones, let nothing be said—their merits have been
grossly exaggerated ! So the wise people, who are
preparing for a run over to Adelaide, have to dis-
criminate between train and boat—but, being wise
people, they don’t take long to decide. They
plump for the boat every time—because it gives
em more comfort, more rest, more room, decent
mea s, and a quantity of assorted breezes, none
ot which are flavored with dead or nearly
oyiqg landscape. Furthermore, it provides
a fairly leisured passage, whereas the train is in
sucn a hurry that passengers only get used to
it after it has arrived at its destination.
1 hus the wise person books his passage at
one of the offices of the Five Companies,
tumbles himself and his baggage on
board, and, one fine day, creeps
down the Yarra and thence out to
sea. And, when he has left Port
Phillip Heads astern, he
begins to appreciate his own
foresight and judgment.
Also, he begins to perceive
the difference between the
sea air and the stuff, adul-
terated with smoke, germs,
and real estate, which the
city dweller charitably calls
atmosphere. Indeed, he
reckons — and rightly —that
the trip round is the best
part of the holiday. He takes sunbaths, lounges
about informally, dresses informally, and talks
informally; and at the end of the journey
feels m such good condition that he wants to lift
weights and chop wood—things that he would pro-
bably have never dreamed of doing before he left
his home, say, in Melbourne. So he arrives in
Adelaide a person with the energy of a steam-
hammer and with the endurance of a camel.
The steamer lands the traveller at Port Adel-
aide, which is 7\ miles from the capital. And the
capitai is best reached by taking the train, which,
like the trains in Eastern States, observes regular
habits, and can be depended upon to arrive at its
destination without accident, Therefore the
traveller takes the train, and, in due course,
emptrns himself and impedimenta upon the plat-
form of the Adelaide Railway Station. Next he
secures accommodation; and, having done that,
takes a stroll about the town.
rt, A l ela ! de ,s in £2 me Wil y- S a surprise packet to
the Easterner. That it has an abundance of
churches, he already knows ; but he hardly ex-
pects to find it—or rather the city proper—laid
out with a regularity that is almost a vice The
streets are so straight that any ordinary thorough-
fare in another capital looks crooked 'in compari-
son, and the squares (of which there are five) have
been placed with such accuracy and precision that
their position is rather; looked upon as an extra-
ordinary accident of calculation. Of course, it isn’t
really so, since the first surveyor of the city knew
tar too much about his business to have ever any
use for accidents. He just went about with his
yard-stick and bit of pencil, and worked out all
the town boundaries on the back of an
old envelope. And the Adelaide which re-
mained behind him is in much the same
place as when he left it. It has grown somewhat,
of course; become plumper about the waistband,
and so forth. Buildings have gone up, bridges
and hotels have been built, the inhabitants have
two Houses of Parliament and a State Governor—
m fact, civilisation round there is just in its fruitful
nonage. Morever, it has trams which whirl, or
did whirl, the traveller out to Burnside near some
charming waterfalls ; to Hyde Park with its gum-
trees and mansions ; and to Paradise, to which
numbers of people go, since they may never see it
again.
Yet, notwithstanding the tram rides, Adelaide
is very attractive to the contemplative person.
It is almost entirely surrounded by park
lands, whose fresh, green quiet induces
a spirit of healthy optimism in the ever-
present canoodler. These parks ought to be
visited on one of those fine, bright days, of which
Adelaide has an alarming amount at this time of
year. But, on a bright night, they are mysterious
—they are said to exude strange noises. How-
ever, the visitor should not omit to move along
North Terrace, and have a look at the Parliament
Houses and at the residence of the State
Excellency, which is guarded on every day (in-
cluding Sundays and holidays) by three statues
commemorating Love, Scotch poetry, and the
Boer war. Other buildings which beg superior
attention are the Museum, with a highly in-
teresting collection of ethnological and natural
history specimens ; the Art Gallery, where there
is really a large collection of fine art; the Zoo,
more instructive on Saturdays—because then it is
free; the School of Mines and Industries, alleged
to be the finest in the Commonwealth, if not in
the universe; and the Town Hall and G.P.O.,
which are two public buildings of some architec-
tural significance. Then there are the Botanical
Gardens on the banks of the Torrens, which
stream has been improved out of all recognition.
Formerly, it was an unedifying strip of liquid ;
but, by banking it up and by beautifying the
banks on either side, it appears to have become
an elegant sheet of water in comfortable, if not to
say, aristocratic circumstances. Further allure-
ments are the Theatre Royal, which provides
theatrical performances quite up to the standard
to which people have become accustomed in Mel-
bourne; the concert halls; and an ice-skating
rink, which, however, may have already retired
into seclusion for the summer.
Outside Adelaide, the places, which the traveller
may inspect and at which he may enjoy himself'
the while, are really too numerous to mention.
He may go to Glenelg or to Henley Beach, which
are near, and have nice, seductive seaviews; or he
may take train to Gawler, and thence on through
the vine districts around Tanunda and Angaston ;
or even he may flit out to Glare, which provides
an additional coach-drive through exquisite
scenery. Furthermore, he may slip down to Port
Elliott, in the immediate
neighborhood of which a
lot of rare scenic
beauty has been spilt
recklessly and cheer-
fully. He may see all
of those places, and
more, and eventually
go on board his
steamer again, with
the satisfactory
thought that he has
had a fearfully jolly
time.

“F.C.”: The efforts made to prop up the
famine prices of butter lately were quite pathetic.
When the market was being forced up to 2s. the papers
every day were filled with paragraphs to the effect,
that there certainly wouldn’t be a drop till just after the
Fleet had left ; arid the public was assured that there
were no supplies stored. When the market began to
waV er —largely because the working inan and his family
had begun to eat jam instead of butter—the efforts were
redoubled; and the papers were told that things were
rather worse for the poor consumer than had been
thought. At last, however, the lie couldn’t be supported
any longer, and down the market flopped, tuppence at a
time. Then some of the truth about no butter being
stored leaked out. In Melbourne one considerable retailer
went round cursing the Age which had announced the
collapse of the market. “The Age, sir, should have
waited till next week before publishing that, and have
allowed us to get rid of our stock. It is a very cruel
deed.” He would have wailed further, but I declined to
be interested ; I was eager to learn whether the whole-
sale men had been hit likewise. From what I have since
learned, I know that a good many of them were.

A suit in the Victorian Supreme Court lately
for balance of wages, expenses, etc., said to be due on
account of a trip which plaintiff made to Papua in
search of rubber, copra, etc., disclosed a brilliant idea for
acquiring sudden riches. The plaintiff took with him,
for trade purposes, a quantity of necklaces, beads,
iew’s-harps, dry paints and tobacco; but he doesn’t
seem to have done much business, the native
taste in jew’s-harps and beads having evidently degene-
rated. Presently defendant omitted to forward funds to
keep "the jew’s-harp bagman going, so he tried to buy
copra on credit; but the native wasn’t taking any credit,
so he was forced to “ accept a position,” and save enough
coin to get back again. But, before returning, he
communicated the brilliant idea. Having perceived that
the Papuan coinage consisted of small shells ground
into a round shape, the jew’s-harp man desired the Mel-
bourne backer to acquire several tons of oyster shells,
have them ground, with a hole in the middle, and stained
red and dispatch them to him forthwith. There was he
assured him, a fortune in it. But alas . the soulless Mel-
bourne person was too cautious, or too tired, or too
honest, so the scheme for rushing the simple-minded
native with imported coin went bung.
“Harrison O.”: To what an extent business
is svnonvmous with robbery is manifested by the tactics
of the purveyors of the necessaries of life, u henever the
slenderest excuse arises. It only requires something a
little out of the usual to happen, and the business-robbers
declare a general rise in prices ; the fact that in 99 5 cases
out of 101 the excuse put forward is absolutely untenable
deters them not one iota. Any old excuse will do. At
one time it was the tariff. How the grocer-man whined
about the dreadful tariff, and the sausage-bloke shed
large creasv tears over it (likewise over the sausage), and
they ’all agreed that it was a most beastly, iniquitous
tariff that forced them to raise the prices of sugar
wallaby-tail and dog’s meat. But the tariff (in spite of
the fact that the duties remain unaltered) is no longer
considered a decently respectable excuse by the grocer
and the meat-man, so the visit of the United States 1 leet
was utilised instead. The Fleet was responsible or
the rise in the retail price of butter from Is. Cid per lb
to ‘’s per lb and cheese from Is. to Is. bd. per lb., and
the”other day my cursed butcher had the “ front to put
up pork chops from Bd. to Is. per lb. on account of the
Fleet which wasn’t even on the horizon then. If the
beef-man can see the Day of Judgment a week ahead I
believe pigs’ feet will be rushed up to 2s. (jd. each.
“Aural” : The average farmer is about as in-
telligent as the spud he grows in the back garden. It
took him 20 years to grasp that bonedust and phos-
phate fertilisers are good for crops. It will take him
another 20 to understand that they were never meant to
replace farmyard manure. A paternal Government strives
to protect him from fraudulent traders, but he continues
to pay £5 a ton for 20 per cent, phosphoric acid (the other
80 parts being sand or useless gypsum), and his thick
skull refuses to be penetrated by the fact that £9 for the
40 per cent, stuff is cheaper. He can’t absorb anything
more involved than that £9 is more than £5.
Meanwhile he cheerfully buys, pays freight on, and
laboriously handles eight tons of sand or gypsum (which
his land doesn’t want) with every two tons of the valu-
able ingredient. And the other day our kind Victorian
Government, which endeavors to teach the unteachable,
was petitioned by the Werribee farmers in conference to
force manure-makers to use lime in breaking down the
superphosphates. Their coagulated top-pieces ought to
have known bv this time that lime renders good phos-
phoric acid insoluble and almost worthless. The man on
the land chasing the lesser sparks from the anvil of
Science is like a dog chasing his tail. The dog mostly
doesn’t catch it, and, if he does, he doesn t know what to
do with it.

Australia must sooner or later face the question
of encouraging the wood-pulp industry. Maoriland has
already done something. Land has been set apart there
for the purpose, the leases being limited to 30,000 acres
to individual applicants. The first to enter the field was
a Christchurch syndicate. Paper-making from wood-pulp
is one of the important industries of the United States
and Canada, whence Australia and Maoriland import
very largely. But the timber areas are decreasing fast
because of the great demand, which grows greater every
year. The timber used for making the substance that the
Tory paper printsits lies on comes from those trees which are
too small to be millable ; and mill waste is used up in the
same way. There are also possibilities, so far as Queens-
land is concerned, of using up the fibrous waste from
the sugar mills—the megass or bagasse, which is already
being turned to account in the manufacture of fibrous
ceilings, etc.

“Janor”: At the local dead marine factory I
met Treloar festooned with hops; also his mate, not
only more so, but also displaying an eye like a picided
walnut highly magnified. I was surprised, for they were
mostly Eechabites. Concluded that they were celebrat-
ing the sale of their reef, and congratulated them.
“ Gerrout,” gritted Treloar. “ Sold be blode. Never ad
er bloomin’ ’ope. You orter seen ther bloke wot they
sent up ter sample ther show. Red ’ot, an’ a fair cow.
’E waltzes up ter ther claim er day afore we expects lm.
Then ’e shies at our bags, an’ pulls outer bundle of is

up ther dolly an’ dish fer ’em, but, blarst me if ’e’d use’m

’umps ther lot up ’ere ter ther pub. So, after a bit, me
an’ Bill comes up after him. Y’ see, ’e ’ad ter camp ere

ther scoundrel ’ad ’anded ’em over ter ther postmaster

but ter offer ’im er cut er ther purchase-money. So Bill
interviews ther swine.” He gazed moodily at his empty
pewter. “ And he refused to deal ? ” I chipped. Treloar
sighed like a punctured tyre. “’E dealt with Bill orl-
rite,” he said. “ Twig ’is lamp ! Jest our stinkin’ luck
ter strike er rotten nineteener like ’im. Lend us one an
er kick, an’ I’ll shout.”

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The Spectator estimates that the new British taxation
required for 1909 will total at least £16,000,000, and con-
siders that it. will be impossible to raise this amount
without jeopardising Freetrade.
The Spectator fears that the voters will not stick to
Freetrade when the tariff reformers assure them that the
fiscal embarrassments will altogether vanish if the country
permits the tariff experiment to be tried. —Cable item.
Where the trade of nations centres and the ends of com-
merce meet,
And the rich importers’ shingles placard every gloomy

In the temple where the pocket-patriots chant their

Stands enthroned the Freetrade idol, god of England’s

Outward token of her splendor,
Symbol of her wealth and might,
Her Protector, Guide, Defender,
Faithful Guardian of her Right,
England boasts his gifts unnumbered and his blessings

their Joss,
Day and night the people worship seeming gold that is

To the starving and the helpless hear the mandate loud
ring out,
To the worker in the city to the toiling country lout:
“ To your knees, ye dogs, before him,
Lest a curse on you should fall.”
Abjectly do they adore him,
All-obedient to the call—
“ Grant us strength to help the foreigner ! ” repeats each
purblind thrall.
But the promised gifts no nearer seem as on the ages
creep,
And the people wonder vaguely at their god’s unbroken
sleep ;
In their poverty they clamor : “ Of our hunger, god, take
heed ! ”
In their serfdom they entreat him : “Grant us freedom,
lord, we plead.”
Fewer grow their supplications
With each unrewarded day ;
Fainter sound their adulations
As the gilding wears away,
Till at last they see their idol, and, behold, the feet are
clay.

produce a moustache on the barest face as full as could
be desired. Made from the recipe of a famous hair

SPORTING
NOTIONS
The Anglo-Welsh Rugby team defeated Queens-
land in both meetings, at the first time of asking by
20 to nil, and the second by il to 8. The difference m
the two struggles was tremendous. In the first the
British had a run over ; in the second, but for a lucky
chance score, they were beaten. The present team seems
to be about the most unpopular combination that has
ever visited Australia, and it is due solely to its methods
on the ground, which can only be described as low.
During the last match in N.S.W. fists were used freely,
and tripping and kicking were unpleasantly common.
Apparently the same tactics were indulged in at Bris-
bane, as The Bulletin receives the following curse from
an old and reliable correspondent:
“The British team, in its two matches in Queensland,
more than upheld the reputation for ruffianism with
which it was credited in N.S.W. and Maoriland. Most
of us up here who read Captain Hardy’s sorrowful com-
plaints re the Maori methods, now wonder how it is that
the crowds over there didn’t combine with the players
and massacre the entire outfit. • In the Anglo-Welshers
first match, on Wednesday, when they ran over a scratch
Queensland team that had not had a game or _a
practice together, they had no occasion to produce their
bao- of tricks. Nevertheless, they gave a fine exposition
of violence, and used feet and hands indiscriminately,
besides arguing raucously with a referee who was fool
enough to let them talk back. On Saturday, when they
met a better team, they were nearly beaten, eventually
winning by 11 to eight. Towards the end of the second-
half, when things looked dangerous, they fairly unbut-
toned themselves, and tripped, handballed, punched and
booted in the ruck with a ferocity worthy of a worse
cause. They did nearly everything except scalp their
enemies. The hitting in the clinches might have given
Burns a lesson. Towards the end, a bad tnis-kick gave the
Undesirable Immigrants a chance, Which put them three
points ahead, and the crowd dispersed, feeling that after
all it had not lost much by not having the Burns-Squires
disagreement in Brisbane.”
* * * *
N.S.W. Western District having challenged
Svdney, the teams met on Saturday, at Sydney Sports
Ground. Western District had beaten the Anglo-Welshers,
who returned to Sydney and beat the Metropolis. Then the
Western District ‘came to Sydney, and was walloped by
the Metropolis. So much for form ! It was a curious
match. While playing against the wind, the Western
men were on top of the townsmen all the while, and at
half time led by a,margin of six points. Then, when it got
the wind behind it the Western team seemed to go to
sleep. It lost its Vitality and its dash, and the Metro-
polis slowlv levelled things up, and finally won by 11 points
to nine. The Western men were far from satisfied, and
another match has been arranged for this coming Satur-
day at Bathurst. On that occasion the country team
pledges its honor to run right ove.r the effete men of the
streets. Failing that it will eat its hat.

When the N.S.W. Rugby League sent its inter-
national team to England to play under the Northern
Union it stripped the local teams as clean as the bunday
rooster’s carcase, and left the club premiership devoid
of interest. The final came off on Saturday afternoon at
the Sydney Agricultural Ground, and although the
interest was flogged up with a sort of variety show, in
which spear-throwing by Queensland aboriginals formed,
a prominent part, only some 4000 people were there to
see the last match of the season and the struggle for the
championship between the two best teams in the .League.
In the previous meeting, Eastern Suburbs won against
South Sydney by 13points to 12. The teams entered the field
on Saturday with a record of only one defeat each during
the competition. On the showing they were just
about dead equal, and it soon became apparent that the
issue would be decided by luck. South drew first blood
in the shape of a try, but irregularities gave East a num-
ber of free kicks, from one of which Brackenrigg placed a
neat goal and reduced the South’s lead from three points
to one. This was followed up by a goal, winch
made the score seven to three in favor of East,
but by half-time South had wiped this disadvan-
tage out, and was leading by eight to seven.
The second half opened with a series of charges by the
Southern backs, who were what is described in -the
classics as “on the job.” East struggled gamely in the
defence, but under Northern Union rules to defend is
to be walloped ; and South again scored. East lecog-
nised that it must attack ; and it did so, vehemently,
making its score nine to South’s 11. Then ensued a
fine struggle for possession of the ball, each side
getting it in turn, but being hauled down
before it could get the globular goods out. At
last, after a fierce tussle, South got possession,
and came away at top speed. It was stopped repeatedl3%
but after every check again got going, and at last reached
the line and burst through, increasing its lead to five
points. East’s only hope was a goal and a draw, and it
played up desperately, and with a magnificent rush scored
a try ; but the kick, failing, left it still two points in arrear.
Then the whistle went, and as no one could run after it
fast enough to bring it back, South Sydney is the premier
club of N.S.W. Rugby League for the 1908 season.
The Soccer semi-finals for the G-ardiner Cup
duly eventuated at Epping ground, Sydney, Saturday
last, when Balmain and Glebe, Adamstown and Pyrmont,
struggled to see who should live on to face death again
the following Saturday. Glebe and Balmain played a
brilliant game, but the premier club prevailed, and Bal-
main was obviously in for a bad time. With Glebe lead-
ing by two goals to nil, the game came to a sudden end.
The referee ordered a Balmain player off the field, and
Balmain made an ass of itself by walking off in protest.
The referee gave it a few minutes to think things over,
and, as there was no sign of its reappearance, he pro-
moted a current of air through his whistle and declared
Glebe the winners.
Extra interest attached to the meeting of
Adamstown and Pyrmont, as Adamstown was the last
country team left in. A mighty struggle took place, in
which an irresistible force came up against an immovable
obstacle. At half-time neither side had prevailed, and
the scoring board was mute and empty. The second half
saw Pyrmont, aided by a strong breeze, make strenu-
ous attacks in quick succession. After some skilful
defence the inevitable happened, and Pyrmont whooped
as it booted the leather into the net. With a roar
like that of a scalded lion Adamstown came away at a great
pace, and, sweeping' right over the forward opposition,
kicked bard for a goal also. But for the wind, that kick
had done its work, and the game would have been a draw;
but it was blown out by a sudden, spiteful gust, and Pyr-
mont won by one goal to nil. The final between Pyrmont
and Glebe will be contested this Saturday at Sydney
Cricket Ground.

Last week saw the continuation and conclusion
of the Australasian Football Carnival, to surprisingly
good “ houses,” all things considered. On Monday the
All Blacks tackled and overthrew the Queenslanders,
though the latter, under the tuition of a Vic. League
expert, vastly improved on their first essay, and put up a
hefty and exciting finish, being but 13 points to the bad
when the bell rang—-35 to 48. Next day the Ma Staters,
likewise advantaged by instruction, gave the Gropers the
cold shivers by scoring almost point for point up to half-
time ; but thereafter they faded away, and the
record at the end was—Ma, 75 points; Westralia,
114 points. Wednesday witnessed the rout of the Maoris
by Tassy (18 points to 84), arid the capsizing of the Crow-
eaters by Bent’s citizens (26 to 75). The case of the South
Oss men was hopeless front the beginning ; they plugged
away towards the end with much vim, but their awful
kicking wrecked what possible chance they might have
had of retrieving the situation. In those 25min. they
potted 10 bebinds and nary a solitary goal, which feat
was a lamentable and disastrous episode. On Thursday
Ma collided with the Queenslanders, and placed 93 points
on the board to Queensland’s 59 ; and on Saturday S.A.
encountered Tasmania, and Vic, met Westralia.
By this time Melbourne was beginning to have
a surfeit of hoof-ball, also the White Warships were mov-
ing from the Heads to the Port what time the first game
progressed, wherefore the attendance of 20,000 was dis-
tinctly pleasing. Also it was mostly a profitable attend-
ance, the M.C.C. stands and promenades showing many
gaps where the deadhead usually plants bis feet. Herein
the deadhead displayed some accidental wisdom, as a
distant view of 16 warships was more cheerful than a near
view of 36 ’bailers, chiefly because in both games 18
of the ’bailers were immeasurably superior to the
other 18. From the bounce of the ball the
Crow-eaters ran away from the Apple-growers,
finishing with 116 points to 49; while the Gumsuckers
were just as much the masters of the Gropers. The
latter started full of vim and speed and strenuous en-
deavor, and at quarter-time were but eight points in the
rea ,._l goal 1 behind to 2 goals 3 behinds. Changing
ends, they threw themelves into the fray, the responsive
crowd cheeringthem on in the hope of a close battle, until
by the middle of the quarter they had equalised the scores.
Then for a few minutes one saw the Australian game
played as it should be played—the sure marking,
the* certain handling and bouncing, the methodi-
cal parsing from man to man, and the swift, straight
kick just clear of the defenders’ heads. In those
dozen minutes the Victorians showed that they held
the game in their hands; that, in fact, they were
more than a match for the best 18 a Combined Aus-
tralia could produce. The second quarter ended, Vic.
51 points; Westralia 15 points ; and thereafter all in-
terest died out. The Gropers played manfully to
the end, but they were run out, dog-tired, done ;
while the Vies, were almost as fresh as when
they started. Scores : 100 points to 40. The result gives
the Cabbage Garden the championship until September,
’ll; Westralia comes second, South Oss third, Tassy
fourth, and baby Queensland last. The only surprise of
the tourney is the uprising of Westralia. The three teams
of comparative novices improved much during the fort-
night, and if they will but digest the lessons learned, and
teach them to others, when the representatives of the
States meet in Adelaide, three years hence* they may give
even the mighty Victorians a shaking up.
Of the eight days of the carnivad two were
Wednesdays and two Saturdays, and the single, inconse-
quent match on each off-day wasn’t expected to draw well ;
consequently the total attendance of about 70,000 was
fair and the receipts—about £lsoo—will square the ex-
penditure all but £lOO. Meanwhile, if Premier Wade has
any perception of the obvious, he will straightway arise
and curse these footballers with great violence ; for as a
federalising institution and a means of bringing contempt
on State Frighters they.are a notable circumstance and a
blight to such as he and Holman.*
Gentlemen who intend taking part in the
Warrnambool to Melbourne cycle race, the premier road
event of Australasia, and about the biggest highway con-
test on earth, will have to be swift about nominating.
Entries close this (Thursday) evening, and if not
nominated by then riders cannot compete. Last year
quite a number of wheelers fell in with a considerable
splash, and journeyed from far States to Melbourne under
the impression that the matter could be “ fixed up some-
how ” ; only to find themselves left out of the race. The
Dunlop Co.* has to be strict in this matter, as the food
supplies, preparation of medals, and a dozen other things
have to be arranged for on a nomination basis. Up to
date, something like 300 men are expected to face the
starter.
m * * *
The Goulburn to Sydney tussle of 131 miles,
which is to decide who will officially represent N.S.W. in
the Warrnambool to Melbourne race, takes place on Sep-
tember 19. No less than 159 riders have nominated.
George Horder and Tom Larcombe are on scratch, while
the limit men are W. J. Ransley, of St. Mary s, and H.
Richardson, of Molong, who both receive 80 minutes
start. That well-known bikey scribe, Beattie Carroll, is
official handicapper, and, as everybody knows, the race is
run under the auspices of the League of N.S.W. Wheel-
men, while the big Dunlop Rubber Co. looks after the
little things the riders care about.

Button and Aunger took exactly 52 days to
traverse Australia from Adelaide to Palmerston. By the
time this appears in print the Overlanders will have left
Port Darwin by steamer for Brisbane, where they will
ao-ain board the car and run down, via Sydney and Mel-
bourne, to Adelaide, home and beauty—provided their
car doesn’t meet its Waterloo on the dreadful substance
that Bent’s State calls a road.

The Municipal Association took a deep interest
in the framing of the Motor Car Bill which recently came
before the Victorian Assembly, and suggested that the
speed limits for town and country should be 10 and 25
miles per hour respectively. Tire various councils were
invited to shed the light of their wisdom on the matter,
and the wrestling- of the councils with the question was a
humorous spectacle. One of Coburg’s city fathers re-
marked that, as the trams travelled 12 miles an hour, it
was absurd to limit the motor cars to 10 ; and another
declared that the way Melbourne was getting slower and
slower positively hurt him. In Sydney, he said, the
electric trams travelled from 25 to 40 miles an hour, and
he o-iiessed 20 miles an hour was a fair thing for a motor
car." It is quite true that trams have travelled between
25 and 40 miles an hour in Sydney, but the blessed coun-
cillor might have added that Manager Kneeshaw heaved
out the drivers as soon as he could get these cars stopped.
There seemed to be a fairly general feeling
against fixing any speed limit, on the curious ground
that it might legally justify a man driving amok as long
as he did not exceed his legal limit. It was argued that
under certain circumstances four miles an hour might be
a dangerous speed, and if the Act said 10 miles an hour,
then the driver could drive at 10 miles an hour, and hang
the odds. Evidently the councils hadn’t grasped what
was required at all. Had they obtained a copy of the
German law on the subject, they would have the whole
thing in a nutshell. In the German Act, the fact that
a motorist has run over or smashed up a man is. un-
less overwhelming evidence to the contrary be produced,
proof that the motorist was guilty of negligence. If the
victim is a breadwinner, then the motorist is liable to be
struck with the keep the widow till she dies or marries
again, and for the maintenance and education of the
children till thev are old enough and able to scratch for
themselves. The only people killed by automobiles in
Germany now are the people who ride in them.
When Paul Guignard. in 1906, streaked over
59 miles 86 yards in 60 minutes on a bike behind pace,
people said the mile-a-minute rider would happen along
the following week. But he didn’t, and when the current
racing season started in Europe, bicycle-making firms
offered big rewards to tempt the world’s first flighters to
make an effort to do the evens, so to speak. In all the
world there were considered to be only six men who had
a chance of achieving it, and they were the same old Paul
Guignard of France,. T. It obi of Germany, Walthour and
Butler of the U.S.A., Gombault of Italy, and T. Hall of
England. Their chances were regarded in that order.
But it was A. E. Wills, sometime English amateur
champion, who suddenly whizzed like a bolt from
the blue over 61 miles 897yds. in 60min. behind pace on
the Munich track, in Bavaria, the same track on which
Paul Guignard made his hair-raising record. Wills is a
little chap, smaller than even Platt-Betts, the erstwhile
crack English follower of pace, who would probably have
done better had he not always been so nervous. Asked
what he thought of his own performance after the race,
Wills, who apparently is not nervous, said he thought
darned little of it, or any Other paced racing. He reckons
the suction of the pacing machine is a great factor, and
the chief point of the game i's to know how to take
advantage of that suction. , All the same, it is a mighty
clever 'thinir to sit on a, bike travelling - a-t such an awful
speed, let alone drive it. . %
Nigel Barker gathered in the N.S.W. amateur
440vds. hurdle and 220yds. flat championships at Sydney
during the Fleet week joyfulness. Besides being a cham-
pion ped., Barker is also a good footballer, and has repre-
sented- N.S.W. in inter-State tussles-, and University in
grade matches. It was his inability to make the trip
which kept Barker out of the N.S.W. Rugby team now on
its way to England. #
Australian champion ped A. B. Postle went
under rather easily to Irish athlete B. It. Day in the
440yds. world’s championship at Dublin, t’other day.
Day won with Byds. to spare in 49 l-ssec. When Day
paraded Westralia last year, Postle repeatedly defeated
him and in the end, the Australian suffered so severely
from inflation of the head.that he rushed off to tackle the
Irishman in his own potato patch. Day’s easy win, how-
ever should enable Postle to wear a hat like an ordinary
person The world’s professional 440yds. record (4ijsec.)
was put up by Day on All Fools’ Day, 1907, at Perth
(W. A.)* The previous best (48Jsec.) stands to the credit of
R. Buttery, in 1873.

South Sydney Harriers’ Parramatta-to-Sydney
footrace last Saturday did not finish as seriously as the
Olvmpic Marathon. The winner managed to struggle
home’ without any assistance, and no protests were
entered Secretary W. H. Wiseman boomed the race as
the longest yet held in Australia. Wiseman’s Athletic
Encyclopaedia must be a relic of the days of York and
Grindall, for the Brisbane Thompson Estate Harriers
hold the honor of having promoted the only Marathon
Race yet held in Australia. This event was run from
Ipswich (Modern Athens) to Brisbane, 26J miles, during
September, 1906. In Saturday’s race Rose Bay swimmer,
j Haigh won his maiden event from less than halt-
limit handicap in lhr. 41min. South Sydney walker,
W E. Corben, held first place until within sight of the
goal, but shut up like an oyster on being challenged by
Hai"-h. Five-and 10-mile champion, Andy W ood, was
handicapped too heavily to win, but ran into fifth
place, and put up fastest time—lhr. 28nun. lOsee.
The medal for the chicken or youngest competitor
was taken by R. Mennie, age 16J years. Corben,
the lad who ran second, again grabbed second
prize for youth; it is only 17 years since he first
saw the light of day. For the Olympic Marathon, com-
petitors must be aged at least 21; thus Mennie s (Bth place)
and Corbeii’s performances are all the better. As a guide
to the cross-country and 10-mile championships, the race
clearly shows East Sydney Club to have the best mob of
purchasers, for they supplied the winner and the
holders of the sth, 11th, 12th, 14th and 16th places, as
well as scoring fastest time. As far as the individual
honors are concerned, Andy Wood appears good enough
to stride with and wallop any of Newtown ms,),
Essendon (Vic.) and Queensland reps, in the big N. b.
Wales events on Sept. 12 and 19.

Sculler Dick Arnst is the latest person with the
conviction that he may become a champion prize-fighter.
“ Don’t be surprised if I take to the heavy-weight boxing-
game myself after the race with Webb,’’ says Arnst.
Whilst getting fit for his sculling exploits, Arnst dabbled
in boxing, and evidently has not got seriously knocked
about; but an impression will presently begin, to arise
that he is trying to be a more numerous athlete than
anv one man can well manage.

“D J ” - The bland assurance of the .parsons
who in their efforts to hurl mud at the championship box-
ing contests that have been in progress here, advance the
—to them —supreme argument that “ nothing of the sort
is allowed in England ” amazes me. There is no one so
dogmatic as an anti-sport parson, and no one so often
wrong. Regarding the subject on which he best loves to
discourse, this brand of cleric is as a little child ; yet he
makes a public ass of himself on sporting questions re-
peatedly, and with loud-voiced gusto. So far from
there being no championship boxing in England,
it is a fair thing to say there is ten times more of it there
than in the Commonwealth. The great pubhc schools
have their, championship tournaments.. (Thus any
old Harrovian will remember with enthusiasm the crash-
ing knock-out which Mr. Rome, who will shortly be in
these parts as A.D.O. to Lord Dudley, dealt his opponent
in the finals of the Public Schools heavyweight'division
tournaments a decade ago.) Oxford and Cambridge meet
every vear under precisely the same code of rules that
hind Burns and Lang. In the nature of things
the University men do each other dam^®
and cause each other more anguish than am
seasoned professionals could in a like case. . I
saw more gore spilt in two bouts I recall at Oxford, in
1899 than I have ever witnessed at any professional fi„ht
since. The British army, with the full concurrence of
well-known officers, conducts a championship boxing con-
test in a big public hall in London each jear. The
“ knock-out ” that causes the local righteous to shudder
is frequent; so are blood and otherlittle unpleasantnesses.
Bur the men think nothing of it; neither dothe
onlookers. And all the . year round in buildk
ino-s of all sorts and sizes, from the national
Snorting Club in London to little shanties in all
the seaside towns of England and Ireland, boxing occurs,
and is held no more infamous than football or cricket.
Tf tbp local oarson has any case whatever against
boxing, he renders that case hopelessly weak by the
fatuous inaccuracies with which he seeks to prop it up.
The asinine talk about the English horror of prize fights
is a "ample of this tendency. There is a prejudice
in certain quarters in Australia against boxing for a
wive or stake- in England the man who serious y
argued that such a thing was wrong would probably
be arrested and subjected to medical examination.
ASTOUNDING SPORTSMANSHIP!
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The Kin? is a great sport. Quite recently one of his
fillies won a race, and notwithstanding a heavy shower
the Kin? left his box to see her unsaddled and weighed
in.— Sydney Star, 22/8/’OB.
Down conies the shower. The course is very wet.
The horses drip beneath a heavy pall
Of mist (the Scotch variety) ; they fret,
So do the jocks. Chill dampness smothers all.
The King is in his box. Outside the rain
Lashes the racers sidling to the post,
Huddled the riders crouch and curse amain—
The King absorbs a whisky with his host.
They’re off ! The Royal party stands at gaze
Before the thin, drenched color-streak that flies
Through mud and slush, until it meets the haze
That hides its hues even from kingly eyes.
A shout, the rush of beating hoof-strokes, then
The frenzied cheers that tell the race is done.
The stands are filled with damp, delighted men ;
They’re wet—what odds ! The Royal Ally’s won.
Now comes the crowning joy of that glad day,
The Owner grabs his gamp and wraps and things,
And braves the wet 1 “ Superb ! ” the people say,
“A king of sport supports the sport of kings.”

A PUG WITHOUT A PUNCH.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“I did mv best,” said Squires. “I had a bit of bad
luck If I had my old punch back I would make him sit
up.”—S. M. Herald, 25 Aug., 'OB.
I useter own a ponderous punch,
Surprisin’ quick an’ strong:,
With which I dealt the stoush around
To ail that came along.
An’ them wot got it on the jaw
Was sure to need “ fust aid,”
But, in a most annoyin’ way,
It’s somehow got mislaid.
I’ve hunted every likely spot
Above an’ underground,
I’ve made a most exhaustive search,
But still it can’t be found.
I’ve looked inside the drawer in which
I keeps cigars an’ pipes,
An’ in the little cupboard where
I hides my drop o’ swipes.
It isn’t underneath the bed,
Nor yet behind the door,
Nor on the roof—l fear I’ll see
That priceless punch no more.
A tigress robbed of well-licked whelps,
A millionaire gone broke,
A maid who’s lost her charms, her youth,
Her virtue, or her bloke—
Are all a bit demented-like,
But none of all the bunch _
Is in the same compartment with
A pug who’s lost ’is punch.
Perhaps it’s been discovered by
Some low-class, prowlin’ pug■;
Perhaps the p’leece have picked it up
An’ took it to the Jug.
If any cove’s concealin’ it
’ls bones I’d like to crunch—
I’ll never be myself again
Until I’ve found me punch.

Every bottle of Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills
sold in the United States of America is guaran-
teed under the “ Pure Foods and Drugs Act,
and bears an extra ianei
with the number of the
certificate and the word
“ Guaranteed,” which de-
notes that the Department
of Health have issued a
certificate that Dr. Morse’s
Indian Root Pills are a
wholesome remedy for the
ailments for which they
are advertised.
Dr. Morse’s Indian Root
Pills are based on a good,
sound formula, and are
not advertised as a great
cure-all. Dor the little ills
of life, for people who eat
too much, and drink too
much, and get their diges-
tive organs, their blood,
liver, and kidneys out of
order, they are a valuable
remedy, and are sold at a
price within the reach of all. As a matter of fact
they cost more to put up than most of the
medicines on the market which are sold at 2s. od.
and 2s. 9d., and anyone who pays Is. ls. od.
for a bottle of Dr. Morse’s Indian Root 1 ills for
the common ailments for which they are adver-
tised, gets good value for his money. Dr. Morse s
Indian Root Pills are a perfect blood purifier and
a sure remedy for biliousness, constipation, indi-
gestion, headaches, sallow complexion, liver and
kidney troubles, piles, pimples, boils, and blotches,
and for all female ailments.

Ex-General Traffic Manager Dunbar, of
Banairaland, was reminiscent, recently, at a com-
plimentary spread. During his 44 years’, service
in the State “where white men can’t work” he had,
he remarked, only lost one day through illness.
That prompted S. Davis, of the Audit Depart-
ment, to rise with the remark that he hadn t
had that much luck—he had lost four days in
31 years.
The wealth of the North Coast dairy lands are
prpverbial, as they enjoy magnificent soil, abundant rain-
fall, and every other necessity for successful dairying.
The Springrove Estate is the latest to be made available
to the farmers. Situated between Lismore and Casino
in the heart of the famous Richmond River country, it is
the most desirable proposition that has been submitted
to dairy farmers for many years. The property is close
to the rail and butter factories, while it is only three
miles distant from deep water. Permanent running
creeks and springs, in addition to a rainfall of from
50 to 60 inches per annum, provide an abundant water
supply. Some indication of the wealth of this district
may be gleaned from the fact that the combined factories
paid suppliers over .£llO,OOO during February of this
year. The terms are extremely liberal, and the estate is
subdivided into 28 farms from 60 to 500 acres.
will be conducted at .Casino on Saturday, October 17, by
the New Zealand Loan and Mercantile Agency Co., Ltd.,
in conjunction with Messrs. C. 11. Anderson and J. B.
McDougall, of Casino, and Hindmarsh and Johnson, of

Sydney Telegbaph has such a stock of
mixed political perjuries on hand just now that it
contradicts itself sadly almost every day. Dis-
cussing the review of Fleet week :
To those who have been familiar with the ups and.
downs of the Defence forces, the parade was an impress-
ive and emphatic proof of the giant strides that have
been made in the last decade.
And yet almost any issne of the Telegraph for
the last five years has explained that the forces
were ruined by Federal administration.

Helpless as a Baby—Followed
a Neighbour’s Advice and Her
CURE BY CUTICURA
HAS BEEN PERMANENT
“My daughter, Mrs. Hannah Austin,
lives with me, and in September, 1906,
something came on
her hands and feet
which a doctor said
was eczema. H e
gave her a box of
ointment which
caused her hands to
swell and run water.
She was in a dreadful
state and as helpless
as a baby. A neigh-
bour, whose child had
had a similar disease
on the head, recom-
mended me to try Cuticura Ointment.
Finding that it did her good, we went
on trying Cuticura Soap, Cuticura
Ointment, and Cuticura Pills. Being
employed in the mills as a silk worker,
my daughter had had to give up work for
a fortnight, but after using Cuticura
Remedies for a few days she was able
to resume her occupation. The disease
not only affected her hands and feet but
went up to her elbows. In all she had
two tablets of Cuticura Soap, three
boxes of Cuticura Ointment (some of
which is still left), and one bottle of
Cuticura Pills. There has been no
return of the distressing eruption and
she is now working regularly. Mrs.
Margaret Doxey, 43, Broad St., Leek,
Staffordshire, June 19, 1907.”

Frank opening l remark from the “ Women’s Letter ” in
Barrier Truth, the Broken Hill labor paper :
“ Weather permitting 1 , I usually wash on Mondays, and
I often feel so tired. 1 would like to do my writing some
other night. But the editor is adamant on the point of
having my copy in on Tuesday mornings. Hence, dear
sisters, don’t forget to let your letters reach Barrier
Truth office on Mondays, or they will be left over for a
week.”
Well, it’s a pleasant change, anyway, from the Ermvn-
trude who writes as though she never had any truck with
anybody less exalted than a duchess, and couldn’t think
of a dinner of less than 12 courses.
* * * *
“ C.M.S.”: The average country newspaper office seems
to be regarded by all the old warriors of the village as a
sort of licensed house, to which they can adjourn on
publishing nights for debate and criticism. The debate
is usually led by Alderman Smooger, who considers that
the space taken up by the last donkey-race or paper-
chase could be devoted far more profitably to his new
scheme for making the town gasworks pay. All criti-
cism in this regard is aimed at the editor and his un-
fortunate assistant. There is generally in the district
some aged nuisance of independent means and a
resulting “ pull ” who has decided to devote his declining
years to literature. He contributes awful, muddled
articles advocating all the measures the paper has been
engaged assailing during the previous six months, and
doggerel poetry of an allegedly humorous brand. When
his efforts are pigeon-holed, as they always are (prelimi-
nary to furtive incineration somewhere or other), he arrives
raging and demands instant insertion. That failing he
hints malevolently of the ruin he is capable of bringing
on the sheet, and treats the editor despitefullv ; raking
up aid hurling at him past grammatical laches. His
chair is taken, on his departure, by the proprietor of the
chief grocery and general store, who bitterly reproaches
the editor for having suffered the standing ad. of the firm
to go in upside down the previous week. Later this trader
talks darkly of the uselessness of advertising anyhow in a
country town ; and (with a hollow laugh) of papers which
are bought but for use as meat wrappers. And shortly
after he has left the drunks begin to arrive. It is hard to
produce high-class journalism, much less literature, in
such an environment.
“Troides: “ It took me six months to learn,” said the
old reporter, “that if a man doesn’t advertise in a daily
newspaper, his wise remarks after a club dinner, or at a
deputation to the Mayor, never reach the composing room.
This came to me in one illuminating flash. I was a re-
ligious lad—don’t laugh, please—and so I was given all
the little church meetings and the Beastly Sunday After-
noons which the rest of the staff didn’t want. Looking
back at myself, I see a bright-eyed youth, filled with zeal,
and with a conviction that, in writing out half-columns
of blathers—which the sub inevitably cut down to pars—
I was an important factor in the spiritual development of
Australia. What more noble task, etc.—you know the feel-
ing. Well, one night I got a scoop. The hireling of the other
rag was absent while the Rev. Somebody-or-other made
some impassioned remarksabout God. Assuming that an
obscure rev., speaking upon such a mighty subject,
deserved as much space as a bishop, and never doubting
in the innocence of my heart that he would get it, I
reported the lecture verbatim, interpolating the applause,
and .later, the sobs of the audience. I took it in. The
sub, a man of wrath, gazed at the wad of copy incredu-
lously. ‘ What’s this?’ he inquired. ‘ A fine lecture,’ I
answered. ‘Hell !’ he said. He turned over the copy.
‘The Clarion hasn’t got it—it’s a scoop,’ I urged,
modestly. He drew a long breath, and winked at the
copy-boy, who stood at his other elbow. ‘ This fellow
cuts no ice,’he remarked. ‘He doesn’t advertise.’ ‘But,’
I said, ‘ it’s a real proof of the existence of God.’ ‘He
doesn’t advertise, either,’ replied the sub, and the copy-
boy laughed coarsely.”

The first penny paper published in Australia was the
long-since deceased Telegraph, of Adelaide —an afternoon
sheet produced by F. Sinnett, afterwards of the Melbourne
Argus. It was established in 1862, and did pretty well
until the Advertiser brought out the Express ; then it
wilted, and in 1867 it and the Express were amalgamated.
The late ex-Premier J. C. Bray was the Telegraph’s
secretary', and carried through the amalgamation.
Twenty-five years later there was another Bonython-
Bray amalgamation ; but this second time the business
was carried through in a church.

“Eric”: In a long reporting experience in several
States I have bumped against nothing so difficult for a
new man to “do” as a meeting of the Marine Board of
S. Australia. The first thing that struck me in the Board
room was that on each member’s writing pad lay a lovely-
sovereign with a humble bob to keep it from being lonely.
On the president’s pad were three of each. Presently the
president sailed in with a devil-take-all-landlubbers
swagger, followed by his faithful secretary'. They' cast
a look at me, and then hurriedly transferred their
glances to the shining objects on the pads. I knew.
“What!” they'thought, “a reporter here—alone—and
these !” As the secretary finished reading the
minutes, my friend of the opposition rag blew into the
room, with a look of scorn that must have told the
Board plainly that it had taken an unprintable liberty in
starting without him. Then the secretary lifted a file of
papers and muttered a few words. The members nodded,
the president said “ Urn,” and then the secretary lifted
another file, and the members nodded, and the president
said “Urn” again. Occasionally a matter was discussed
at length, but it was so much jargon, when no clue to
its nature was obtainable. A wild fear that I
had mistaken my vocation took possession of the
remnants of my soul; but just here the other paper
came to the rescue with the remark that there was
nothing special in the meeting, and that he would give
me the strength of it afterwards. He kept his plighted
troth in the cosy seclusion of a bar parlor, where he re-
lieved my ruffled feelings by the information that during
his long experience of the Board no new man had been
able to get down a line at his first attempt. “After a
couple of meetings you’ll be as right as beer, old chap,”
he said, encouragingly. But, by dint of much diplomacy',
I succeeded in dodging that Board’s meetings ever after-
wards, so that I cannot tell whether my friend the enemy'
was speaking the truth or following the usual policy 7 of
his paper.
“SENATOR PULSFORD WRITES.”
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
There are things that pass from the public mind,
As they fade from the public press ;
No more of the tramway strike we find
And of Judkins rather less ;
The gush o’er the Gov’nors that depart
Is forgot with the latest Knights—
But we can’t get away from the stuff that starts
With “ Senator Pulsford writes : ”
Those letters come with the eggs and ham
That we worry at 8 a.m.;
When our labor’s done, on the homeward tram
We’re hit in the eye by them ;
And if we open a printed page
By our fireside’s glow o’ nights,
It’s odds that we’ll find some statements sage
That “Senator Pulsford writes.”
Into the corset ads. they bog,
And the cables they pervade ;
With Beid and his desiccated dog,
And the latest yap from Wade ;
In the football page, where the conflict’s ripe
That the League with the Union fights,
There’s a hundredweight of the solemn tripe
That “Senator Pulsford writes.”
And when the saints and the sinners sad
Are sorted which from which,
And they find there’s a crowd that is far too bad
For the Lake of Boiling Pitch.
They’ll round that mob of the ultra-vile,
Where the Serpent sultry bites,
To read for aye from an endless file
What “Senator Pulsford writes.”

Just try one or two Cockle’s Pills. They will give a fillip to the

jr VE.RY MAN
who is Weak and
Failing knows that there should be “something” that
will restore that “old-time vigor ” to his body. He
has invariably tried all kinds of medicines and found
them a total failure. He finds himself worse instead
of better. If you have been paying money to doctors
and taking nasty medicines for years, and have
derived no benefit from it all, do you not think it
is time to stop 1 Twenty years’ experience with
drugs and electricity has confirmed us in the
knowledge that Electricity alone, without any
other material aid, will rc>-
plaee and renew lost energy
and vitality, and that our appliance is the only prac-
tical, commonsense way of applying it. Thousands of
grateful letters from cured patients, who suffered from
Debility, Weakness of all kinds, Lost Vigor, Ner-
vousness, Kidney Trouble, Backache, Rheuma-
tism, Sciatica, Varicocele, Indigestion,
Constipation, and Stomach, Liver and
Bowel Troubles, tell us that medicine failed
to Cure them, and that “Nature’s Cure,”
Electricity, as given by the improved
DR. McLAUCHLIN'S ELECTRIC CELT
with its Special Attachments for Men and Women, DID CURE them after they had given up hope. It is the grandest invention of the
age for weak people. . . . No weak, sickly, delicate person will ever regret giving it a fair trial. It is within the reach of all. The
price is as low as £1 in most cases. We are the originators of the Electric Belt system of home treatment in Australasia. Our Belt is
the standard. It is Guaranteed; no charge for repairs, and will last a lifetime. BEWARE OF IMITATIONS.

‘ ‘ Genesha rt writes *—
The drunk has queer notions at times. Beer plays
strange pranks with different temperaments, and alcohol
makes some folk think of funny things. A drunk can
imagine himself Bill Squires and make a futile effort to
punch a policeman. But the fighting drunk is common-
place. When he’s big he’s dangerous; when he’s small
he’s a public nuisance. He can become Don Juan and
splutter passionate vows across the public bar till he’s
chucked out. He can work himself up into a maudlin
patriot, and weep salt tears because the Prince of Wales
once had boils. He caii transform himself into a
roj'sterer, like Falstaff, and throw a brick at a street
lamp ; into a Morpheus who wants to sleep on the pave-
ment ; a genial jovial soul who slaps people he doesn’t
know on the back, and “ God blesses ” them
in a husky, emotional voice ; a bitter and unfor-
tunate genius, who has been neglected by a hard
world, and has to be taken borne, across the swamp,
by still more bitter and unfortunate friends ; a little
whiskered man who insists on talking about his dear
wife ; a futile young spark who makes vain efforts to cuss
with conviction in order to display his reckless dare-
devilry—and many other curious followers of Bacchus. A
drunk can think himself anybody, but uncommon is he
who mistakes himself for Judkins. Daniel Finch, a Yank,
appeared before a Melbourne court on the strange charge
of stealing Bibles. A curious jumble of ideas, this.
Judkins, drink, and Bibles had got confused in the United
States brain. The Yank must have heard of Judkins.
Judkins led to the drink question ; drink (and Judkins)
led to Bibles, which lie round in cartloads in this city,
and the Bible, which Dan lifted in his fervor from a truck,
led to a choice of 40s. or seven days. Dan couldn’t
unravel the situation. He had no violent hankering after
a Higher Life. He didn’t want a Bible. He preferred a
hot pie. “I was drunk,” said Dan, “ and didn’t know
what I was doing.” Salvation showed him the ghastly
precipice of righteousness he had fajlen over.

BRONCHITIS
CURE.
The Famous Remedy for
Coughs, Bronchitis, Pneumonia,
Pleurisy, Asthma & Consumption
BRONCHITIS and PNEUMONIA
Cured by
HEARNE’S BRONCHITIS CURE
After other Treatment had Failed.
Mr. W. G. Hearne. Dear Sir, —From a strict sense
bf duty I feel that I should publish the following state-
ment, so that others may know what to do when the
awful fact is evident that a life is in danger of being
lost:—ln September, 1906, my little girl, aged at that
time 3 years, contracted Measles, and in the following
October was attacked by Bronchitis, Pneumonia and
Congestion of the Lungs. She was attended by a
legally qualified doctor of high standing, but his treat-
ment was not successful in arresting the progress of the
illness. On Saturday, the 21st October, 1906, he said
that her life was in danger—that there was very little
hope for her. For eight days and nights she had been
prostrated by Cough, Pain and Fever, and was lying
like a statue, unconscious. At this stage I was per-
suaded by a friend to obtain Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure,
with its auxiliary medicine for the Fever and Conges-
tion of the Lungs, as directed in the Catalogue of
Medicines which accompanies each bottle of the Bron-
chitis Cure. I gave the medicine as directed, and there
was an improvement from the first dose of Hearne’s
Bronchitis Cure. The improvement continued after
each dose cf the medicine. In a week she was perfectly
free from the Pneumonia, Congestion, Cough, Pain and
Fever, and was well, except that she was still weak. In
a fortnight she was quite recovered, and is now in
splendid health, and stronger than ever. Any person,
asking for information about this grand medicine can
be supplied by me, or by any of my neighbours who have
witnessed its wonderful effects. It absolutely snatched
my child from an early grave.—Yours gratefully,
D. GARDINER,
Police Station, Geelong East, Feb. 5, 1908.

immediate Relief-Effect Wonderful,
Mr. Hearne. Sir, —I was very ill with Influenza
and Bronchitis. A friend of mine persuaded me to try
your Bronchitis Cure. The first dose gave me imme-
diate relief, and after taking the second bottle I am
thoroughly cured. Its effect on me has been most
wonderful. lam 73 years of age. I trust you will
make use of this statement by publishing it for the bene-
fit of humanity generally. Yours most respectfully,

PNEUMONIA and PLEURISY
cured by
HEARNE’S BRONCHITIS CURE
After other Treatment had Failed.
I, Prudence M‘Kee, of Carr-street, South Geelong, in
view of the importance of a person making it quite clear
what treatment was successful in curing a serious and
complicated case when the medicine, directions and treat-
ment of a legally qualified doctor had failed, state as
follows:
My son, Henry M‘Kee, then aged 8 years, had been
attended by a legally qualified doctor, who pronounced
him to be suffering from Pneumonia, Pleurisy and a
stoppage of the passing of Urine. Under the doctor’s
treatment the child gradually got worse, and the doctor
pronounced the case hopeless. He told me that the
child could not live. At this stage I obtained from
Mr. W. G. Hearne, Chemist, of Geelong, a bottle of
Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure, and gave it to the child, ac-
cording to the directions which accompany each bottle
of it. The child improved after the second dose of
Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure. He continued to improve
each day from each dose of Hearne’s Medicine alone, and
within three days he was free from the Cough, Pneu-
monia and the Pleurisy, and the Urine was passing satis-
factorily. He was out of bed at the end of a week,
completely recovered, and he is now in perfect health.

CONSUMPTION.
Too 111 to Leave His Bed.
A Complete Cure.
Mr. W. G. Hearne.
Dear Sir, —I am writing to tell you about the wonder-
ful cure your medicine has effected in my case. About
three years ago I began to cough. At first the cough
was not severe, but it gradually got worse, and I became
very weak and troubled with night sweats, pain in my
chest, and great quantities of phlegm. On several oc-
casions there was blood in the expectorated matter. I
had been treated by a doctor who pronounced my case to
be consumption, and various other treatments had been
tried, but without benefit. It was at this stage that I
heard of your Bronchitis Cure, and sent to you for a
course of the medicine. When it arrived, I was too ill
to leave my bed, but I commenced taking it at once, and
gradually improved. lam glad to say that the two
lots of medicine you sent have effected a complete cure,
for which accept my very best thanks. —Yours gratefully,
J. BLAIR.

BRONCHITIS and PLEURISY.
A Severe Case Cured by Two Bottles of
Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure.
After Other Treatment had Failed.
Mr. Hearne, Chemist, Geelong.
Dear Sir, —Some months ago, in Sydney, I suffered
from a severe attack of influenza, and was confined to
my room for about a week, at the end of which time,
feeling somewhat better, I got up and tried to transact
my business as usual. But I got up too soon, for the
very next day I had a relapse, and suffered tortures from
what the doctor told me was pleurisy and bronchitis.
The pain from the former in my chest and shoulders
was frightful, and for four long weeks I was confined to
my bed under the care of a well-known Sydney doctor,
.and all the time his medicine gave me but temporary
relief. The landlady of the hotel (the Cleveland), where
I resided, told me of a medicine^—Hearne’s Bronchitis
Cure —from Victoria, which had cured her of a bad at-
tack of bronchitis and pains in the chest, and begged
of me to try it. I did so, and, in thanks and gratitude
to you, tell you that, after the second bottle, m_y cough
had ceased; but what is more astonishing, the pains from
pleurisy entirely left me, and in about a week I was able
to attend to my duties as usual.—Yours faithfully,
J. BRAHAM.

ASTHMA—A 17 YEARS CASE.
Previous Treatment Failed.
Cured by Three Bottles,
Mr. Alex. J. Anderson, of Oak Park, Charleville,
Queensland, Wrote: —“After suffering from asthma for
seventeen years, and having been under a great many
different treatments without benefit, I was induced to try
Hearne’s Medicine for Asthma. After taking three
bottles of this medicine I quite got rid of the asthma,
and since then, which was the beginning of .1883 —fifteen
years ago—l have not had the slightest return of it.
The medicine quite cured me, and I have much pleasure
5n recommending it.” .
Speaking in February, 1908, he states: —“I am keeping
very well. Never have the slightest return of the asthma.”
“ Hearne’s Medicine cured me of Asthma, from which
I had been suffering for twenty-five years, during which
time I had used almost every patent medicine on the
market—including asthma inhalations —without getting a
cure. It was 8 years ago that the cure was effected
by Hearne’s Medicine, and I now feel stronger than I
have felt for years—in fact, I feel splendid.”
C. WISEMAN,
Meredith, Victoria.
Beware of Imitations ! The great success of HEARNE’S Bronchitis Cure has induced a number of
unprincipled persons to make imitations, each calling his medicine “Bronchitis Cure,” with the object of deceiving
the unsuspecting, and so getting a sale for an imitation which has none of the beneficial effects that HEARNES
Bronchitis Cure has. Consequently it has become necessary to draw your attention to this fact, and to request you
in your own interests to be particular to ask for HEARSE’S, and see that you get it.
HEARNE’S BRONCHITIS CURE, Small Size, 2/6; Large Size, 4/6, Sold by all Chemists and Medicine Vendors, and by the
Proprietor, W. G. HEARNE, Chemist, Geelong, Victoria. Forwarded to any Address, when not obtainable locally.
NOTlCE— Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure No. 1a does NOT contain any Morphia or any Opium whatever. It is equally beneficial
for the youngest child and the most aged person.

A Song of Sandy Beaches.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THEY snare us with their smiling, with their
soft, seductive tones.
With their wild, ecstatic praises of the sea.
And, beside the sandy seashore, by the seaweed
and the bones
Of sea-things bleached and bare, they give us tea!
There’s sand among the tea and cake, and drift-
wood in the beer,
White sand among the sandwiches, in stacks ;
Red beetles, stricken crazy, in the pots of cream
appear,
And whirling sandstorms battle down our backs.
But, when the tea-things rattle in the nose-bag
once again,
And when fond, flashing eyes suggest a stroll,
And you say. at once, “ Let’s wander ! Oh,
the siren’s stirring then
The sediments of purple in your soul !
Down by the shining seashore, by the moonlit
shallows green,
With the sea-blue on the yellow sand below,
The sirens smile and chatter, and we wander—
with a screen
Of ti-tree springing round us as we go !
Ah, when, the hours uncounted and the sinful
world forgot,
Slim, siren fingers clamber round your heart,
And siren lips and tresses are near by—you
trouble not
About the time the homeward shays depart!
The summer sirens snare us with their gushing
monotones
Of the sweetness of the moonlight and the sea.
And, with dead, decaying dogfish draped around
on slimy stones,
In eternal smells of seaweed we have tea !
V[C.
FRANK HENTY.
When Greatrex Let His
Heart Go.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
GREATREX and I were making a
somewhat fluctuating income by con-
tributing to Sydney and Melbourne
weeklies, and for the sake of convenience and
economy we shared a large balcony room in
Stanley-street, Sydney, which runs through the
slum that has the impudence to call itself after the
rose-strewn Hyde Park. It was a nice room,
large, lofty, and with a deep balcony, from which
we could look clear across the roofs of Woolloo-
mooloo to where wide-breasted tramp steamers
leaned against the wharves of the bay.
Contributing is pleasant work, providing one
can get enough copy accepted by editors to pro-
vide a regular and decent income. After break-
fast we settled down and wrote steadily. In the
afternoons we went out to see and hear more
write about, and when we saw nothing
to one another the things we ought
to-have seen. Greatrex said it was healthy
exercise for the imagination, and a well-trained
and athletic imagination was one of the best assets
a journalist could possess.
Greatrex, unfortunately, had a weakness; a bad
one, which was aggravated by his having it in as
bad a form as a man could have it and be at large.
It was an impulsive nature with a tendency to let
his heart go. The weakness showed itself at its
worst in dealings with women. I had no vices,
unless a fondness for late suppers of considerable
cost can be stretched to fill the definition. But
the huge solidity of my virtue did not nearly com-
pensate the firm for the vastness of Greatrex’s
frailty.
Contributing “on space” was not a very lucrative
business, but I still look back to those days with
regret. At least we were always able to make
enough to pay our way, and they were bright,
irresponsible days when nothing really mat-
tered. When we had money we enjoyed
ourselves, and when we were short We sat
down and wrote hard. There was never actual
want, and sometimes there was affluence. And,
best of all, there were no responsibilities. We
had not advanced to the high estate of having
our paper floating around the town, and one day
a month hence was as good as any day six months
in the future. We could even have died in those
golden days with light hearts, happy in the know-
ledge that our decease would make a gap in no
one’s life. Three or four crusty editors would
have remarked that they had received no copy
from those two fellows whose names they could
never think of, and then they would have plunged
into the heap of other men’s copy and forgotten
us for ever. There were plenty to take our places,
and to right-thinking men there is much joy in
being people of no importance.
One afternoon we dived into an auction mart
out of the sun, and found a hard-faced man selling
lengths of tweed and other cloths. While I
mooned round, looking at cracked china and
battered furniture, I heard Greatrex’s voice
suddenly yell, “ Fifty-five ! ”
I hurried to the ring of bidders and, seizing
him by the arm, dragged him away.
“Come out of that, you old fool!” I said
roughly.
“It’s dirt cheap,” he expostulated; “enough
for a suit each and an extra pair of pants for each
suit —all for fifty-five bob.”
“Yes, but I know you—now you’ve started
you’ll let your heart go, and we’ll have nothing to
live on next week.”
Then the clerk came for the cash, and after
paying him we started for home, calling in at a
tailor’s on the way. We had' a great discussion
as to what cut we should go in for. Finally we
decided on double-breasted coats and peg-top
pants.
“What about a bit of white watered silk on the
lappels ? ” inquired Greatrex with a sudden in-
spiration of the Devil.
I nearly fell off the chair.
“No,” I howled, “certainly not. Why don’t
you propose we should wear bangles and earrings?”
ij was a delicate grey tint that
looked foppish enough without any silk about it.
‘ It would give a nice dressy finish ! ” persisted
Greatrex.
“ I won’t have it,” I said doggedly, and the big
fellow subsided.
* * * *
On the following Saturday I arrived home j ust
before one o’clock. Greatrex had collected our
101l 01 ” 11 dividend at the various newspaper offices,
and the dividend was good. Also Greatrex was
m a state of acute excitement.
Hurry up and shave yourself, old man. The
suits are home, and I have made an appointment
with two peaches for both of us at half-past two.
We’ll take’em to Manly and then back to town
for a blow out and to the theatre afterwards.
I’ve got a couple of passes from old Smith, who
has something better on and wants me to do the
show for him.”
“ Peaches—who are they ? ”
“Some girls. They’re real plums. Up to
snuff, too won’t go out without one another —so
you ve got to come along and take one off my
hands.”
I daresay they have heard the sort of cove you
are. Anyhow, if they’re as charming as they
seem to be sensible, we ought to have a highly
intellectual time.”
At dinner I suggested it was foolish to waste
the whole afternoon on nectarines. It meant
missing tons of good copy. But he swore we
would derive heaps of inspiration from the society
of the two fruits, and, being a weak man, I
allowed myself to be persuaded.
When the suits were opened up I found to my
disgust that they both had water-silk facings. I
stormed and stamped, declaring I would not wear
the things. I got into my old clothes, but a second
glance in the glass convinced me they were even
less suitable for the company of persimmons than
the new ones, and they were bad enough. As
there seemed nothing else for it, I got into the new
ones, and wondered if it would be possible to
wear a buttonhole on either side to hide the silk
facings.
It was after two when we got out and started
at a brisk walk for the tram, for the peaches, it
seemed, grew in Darlinghurst. The burning sun
melted the asphalt, and in the fervent heat the
street was deserted. All was peace.
There was a sudden burst of abuse in a shrill
female voice. A man’s baritone made reply in a
tone of weary expostulation, and as we passed a
cottage a jug flew through an open window. I
ducked, and the thing landed on Greatrex’s chest.
It was full of beer, and the stuff splashed over his
beautiful new coat, staining the white silk facings
sadly. I got out of the line of fire, and guffawed
loudly. It seemed like an intervention of Provi-
dence to prevent the afternoon being wasted.
With an oath, Greatrex sprang to the door, and
nearly pounded it in with the knocker. It was
opened timidly by a pale, thin woman, in most
deplorable rags.
“ I’m sorry the beer hit yer, mister ! ”
“That won’t improve my coat!” snarled
Greatrex.
“1 know it won’t. But it was like this: Me
husband’s bin outer a job for months. We’d
pawned everythin’ they’d take, an’ larst Monday
week he started on the works at Shea’s Greek, an’
grafted real hard ever since, an’ earned four pun
sixteen. An’ me gettin’ the tucker on tick at
ther corner shop. To-day he goes out an’ gets
paid. An’ he blewed it all on the way home but
seven bob; an’when he comes in, he takes the
jug to the pub an’ gets more beer. An’ when I
sees what he’s done, I just took the filthy stuff an’
chucked it through the window. An’ you was
passin’, worse luck !”
She stopped, and looked drearily down the
burning street. The hopelessness of it all
crushed us. There was heavy silence.
“Of course,” said the woman, moistening her
lips, “if I can do anything—sponging, ironin’, or
anythin’ like that—l’m willing. I’ve got five
little ones ”
“He ought to be hung!” said Greatrex im-
pulsively, “Here, I was going out to have a
wild time, to blew this on women and tucker ; but
somehow I think you’d better get food for the I
kiddies.”
His hand dived into his waistcoat pocket, and
pushed a small handful of silver into her palm.
Before she could find words we were half way up
the street on the road home. Greatrex’s clothes
were too unpresentable for an encounter with the
peaches, and he smelt like a dead brewery.
* * * *
We got into our old clothes and started for the
Cricket Ground. As we scrambled into the tram
he shouted to me to pay the fares :
“I gave the old party all the silver and don’t
want to ask the guard to change gold for thrum
fares.”
“ Don’t break into the gold at all. I’ve got
some silver, and when that’s done we’ll go home.
Once a quid’s broken it’s as good as spent.”
“ That’s right,” he replied, wagging his head at
my forethought.
It was midnight when we staggered home,
loaded up with liquid and smokes for the morrow.
Next day we started for a French cafe in the
new suits. Our landlady had done something to
Greatrex’s clothes, and there was nothing wrong
save a faint brown stain. At the corner we got
into a cab, and requested the driver to make the
horse crack his tail. We were in a jaunty mood.
We clattered up to the door of the caffi. A
waiter came out and assisted us to alight.
“Got any silver?” said Greatrex. “I forgot
to get change last night.”
“Not a bean—haven’t got anything. Smash
up a quid ! ”
Then Greatrex felt, one after another, every
pocket he had about him, without raising a sign
or color. His face assumed a drawn expression
and perspiration broke out on his forehead. I
felt my knees beginning to shake, and then my
side muscles suddenly gave way.
“ Ten thousand devils! Cabby, we’ve come out
without a stiver ! Drive us home, please ! ”
“ There’s just a chance I left it in my other
waistcoat pocket,” he said ; “ but I’m very much
afraid something terrible has happened. Hang
me if ever I let my heart go again.”
“How?”
“ Well, I usually carry silver only in my right-
hand waistcoat pocket, and keep gold, when we
have it, in my left. I’m afraid yesterday I had
’em mixed up together all in my right pocket ;
and, if so, that darned woman got the lot. For I
just dived my hand into my pocket and gave her
everything in it, thinking it was all shillings.”
“Oh Lord, oh Lord!”
“Yes, we’re stone, paralytic broke. How will
this cabby perform ? ”
Investigation proved it to be only too true. His
other pockets were as bare as those he wore. W e
cabbed wildly down to the cottage to interview
the woman. The naked windows leered at us.
“ Great heavens! they’ve gone ! Look at the
windows ! ”
A small urchin sidled up.
“ They shot ther moon larst night, boss!” he
explained. “ Yer done in.”
“ What for ; we're not the landlord’s men ? ”
“No, you’re the jugginses wot give her the
yellow boys all mixed up with the casers. That’s
why they cleared.”
“ Where have they gone ? ”
But the urchin placed one finger to his eye,
grimaced, and faded away.
“Darn me if ever I let my heart go again ! ”
said Greatrex, and then turned to face the cab-
man who had commenced his performance. When
the performance was finished the two new
suits were quite ruined, the cabby was in tatters,
and one door had been torn off the cab.

With the approach of Spring do you find little rough
patches on your forehead or cheeks or chin ? Has your
skin that curious “ tight ” feeling which is so opposite
to the soft elasticity of the skin in summer ? Are your
hands or finger=ends sore ? Is your skin, because of
its burden of impurity, disfigured by nasty pimples,
boils, abscesses, or eruptions ? Have you a raw, tender
feeling where your skin creases—or are you very liable
to chafing about the neck ?
These “ danger signals,” which constitute the
first signs of an unhealthy skin, should never be
neglected. Following in their train are all the tortures
of fiery eczema, wide=reaching blood=poison, and
ulcerous sores.
Nothing is more important than the way we should treat this
skin disease. It is not the slightest use relying upon any internal
remedy or external application if these do not reach the impurity
itself, which is the cause of the disorganisation in our delicate and
intricate tissues. Cheap and coarse ointments and so-called blood-
mixtures may make eczema 11 slumber” awhile, but the disease
soon breaks forth in all its “ fire ” and itching irritation, for the
root-evil has not been touched.
Just because Zam-Buk Balm possesses a natural affinity for
the skin, and because it is, moreover, a rich balm built up of
Nature’s rarest and purest vegetable juices, it is everywhere used
and recommended. Zam-Buk is so refined that the tissues absorb it
readily; and its medicinal essences at once attack the disease below
the surface. Wherever the skin has been injured by accident or
eaten by disease, Zam-Buk promotes the growth of new and healthy
tissues in a quick and marvellous manner.
Zam-Buk Balm is the truly natural and ideal substance that
has long been wanted for the treatment of cuts, bruises, burns,
scalds, chaps, sprains, all kinds of festering and inflammation, and
in treating in a new way the worst cases of eczema, pimples, boils,
ulcers, bad legs, piles, psoriasis, scurf, ringworm, children’s scalp
troubles, Spring skin disorders, and all itching, irritable, and choked
up conditions of the skin.
In a sentence, the secret of a healthy skin is: Keep Zam-Buk
always handy and use it daily. Skin disease will then be banished
and the tissues made sound, healthy and strong. Every home needs
its pot of Zam-Buk Balm.

Bill’s Morning Affair.
Bill's Sunday mornings Affair.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
EVERY bushman admits that the dingo
is not a white man’s dog, for the dingo
thinks like a blackfellow and fights like
one. It is the only creature on earth, bar the tor-
toise and periwinkle, that allows the naked hand
of man to steal its young without protest.
I have tried to love the Australian dingo, but
soon discovered that his friendship was never
worth a hill of beans, no matter how much meat
was on the floor. At an early age it recognises a
sheep from a policeman, but as a fighter and de-
fender of its own kin it gives all right-thinking
sportsmen a pain under the heart.
At Beltano station, in 189 G, I witnessed a wild
and hurried fight between a white man’s dog
named Bill and a blackfellow canine from the
Murchison.
Bill belonged to me. I bought him one wet
night from a drunken Finn in the Argyle Cut,
Sydney. As a pure-bred bulldog Bill was abso-
lutely useless to a bushman or a conductor of
cattle, but when his mouth was in working order
he could give the Mayor of Chicago several
inches.
From Broken Hill to Wilcannia I carried Bill.
He refused to walk more than five miles a day,
and he moistened the earth with bulldog tears
when asked to chase even a medium-sized rabbit.
He was lazy and sourly affectionate, but I never
met a man on the track who couldn’t spare him a
feed.
At Beltano station the manager offered me
thirty shillings for Bill, and the promise of a job.
I accepted the offer, but not the job. Bill’s
destiny skated to its zenith the first wet Sunday
he became station property. A man named
Logan came in from Mount Brown, accompanied
by a big black dingo named Paddy.
Ten minutes or so after the dingo’s arrival the
air was luminous with suppressed dog fight. Men
came in as if by magi© from Menindie, Cobar and
the outside tracks beyond Herbert Downs.
My sporting instincts were outraged on hearing
that Bill had been matched to fight Paddy. It
was a cruel arrangement whereby William con-
ceded nearly half-a-stone to his stocky, long-
shouted opponent.
There is no doubt about the dingo’s one-bite
attitude. He is like the pugilist with the one hit,
and if he misses there is always a burrow handy.
Other admirers of the blackfellow dog swear by
his shifty ring methods and lightning change of
front.
I felt sorry for little Bill, and offered to buy
him back if tiie manager would forego the fight.
I also threatened to bring along the Rev. Mr.
O’Toole, from Carawa, to intercede on behalf of
Bill.
The manager smiled, and said that his reverence
had been towel-holder at the last little affair
near .
In my despair I strolled over to the men s huts
and looked at Paddy. He was sulking in the
shade of a bush, and I examined him curiously,
hip, eye and tail. I am always interested in the
tails of fighting animals.
I snapped my fingers and whistled to him
softly. He rose and side-loped 50yds. in five
seconds; then he flashed round and looked at me
stiff-eared and curious.
i“ That dawg can scrap.” A fathom-long stock-
man slouched from the huts and regarded the
dingo critically.
“Sheep or,sick swagmen ?” I asked.
Later I discovered Bill asleep in the harness-
room on a buggy cushion. He looked thin and
hoopy about the ribs, and when I whistled he
merely looked at me through the slits in his face.
Shearers and rouseabouts strolled round to the
harness-room to look at him. Everybody ad-
mitted that he would put up a brief and horrible
fight when the moment arrived. But the men
who fancied the blackfellow dog were legion.
Bill might be a perfect vampire for holding on,
they said ; but one and all admitted that the dingo
was an underground engineer with a. Bite.
On Sunday morning—it was raining—Paddy
was led inside a wire-netted enclosure, followed
by his friends and supporters. There was rain on
his black coat, and a wild, hurried look in his eye
as he trotted round the enclosure sniffing the wire.
Bill came from the harness-room hauling on his
chain. The crowd whistled the Dead March, and
I was advised to regale him with beef and carrots
before slipping him at Paddy.
When Bill saw the wire enclosure he looked
pleased and refreshed. And as we entered the
sacred precincts his bright eyes rested in astonish-
ment; on the black dingo standing in the far
At that moment Bill did really look like an
English country gentleman, square on his pins,
and immovable as a non-paying tenant. Yet 1
could see that the wire-netted enclosure made him
uneasy; he whined pathetically as he surveyed
the sft. wire, and' then the dingo. In a flash 1
divined his anxiety. „ T ~
“No, he can’t climb out, Bill, I said, patting
his back. “It’s the finest fowl-wire.” Again
Bill looked refreshed. His capacity for exhibiting
himself in various kinds of refreshed attitudes
was striking.
Just here the station overseer addressed me m
his best dog-manner. “ Bring your animal to
scratch, ” he said coldly. “And don t slip him
until the referee speaks.” ,
I could have informed the noble assembly that
it was customary to wash pups in milk before
hurling them at each other. Some unprincipled
sports have a habit of dressing their dog’s hair
with arsenic. .
I noticed too that the time-keeper had to haul
Paddy to scratch while a tarboy and rouseabout
pushed from behind. Bill hauled me and my
assistant to the front. We had to half-strangle
him to prevent him arriving too early.
At this point every rule of the game was
ignored. The crowd simply licked its lips and
cried, “Let ’em go ! ”
The manager slipped Paddy, and he stood like
a homeless wolf in the middle of the ring, his ears
thrown forward, his eyes riveted on the plug-
shaped dog with the face. ... , ,
Bill slipped from my grasp with the speed of a
greased torpedo, and the dingo flew round with a
yell that cut the betting in half.
The only time a dingo is fond of a white man is
when he is being looked for by a bulldog. Paddy
flew among their legs, calling for motor-cars and
other conveyances, until brought to bay in a
corner of the wire enclosure.
It was here that my brain photographed our
dingo’s one great bite —it is the old wolf and
jackal trick, the swift turn and thej murderous
snatch over the shoulder. Paddy missed and liis
snatch flew wide. Fighting sheep and wallabies
is bad training for a dog. He missed. Bill swept
under his breast and gained a knee-joint hold,
and brought him over & la Hackenschmidt.
Still, one is certain that, if the black dingo had
got in his lonely bite, Bill would have been com-
pelled to adopt journalism as a means of keeping
himself alive.
Sheep and kangaroo fighting is very well in its
way, but the Australian dingo would have been a
nobler defender of himself if the bulldog pro-
blem had entered his life a few centuries earlier.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
OF all the drinks I ever drank
(And I have drunk a few,
If I’m to be entirely frank
Betwixt myself and you),
At home, abroad, afar, or near,
No potions man could brew
Have ever made me half so queer
As Schweinheim’s used to do.
This Schweinheim was a publican
And storekeeper, who dwelt
With artless, coffee-colored man
Within the tropic belt.
The isle that formed his trading-ground
Had Adam might mistake
For Eden, if he were around—
And Schweinheim was its snake.
A reptile of the craftiest,
And ugly as a toad,
He squatted, a most blighting pest,
On that once blest abode.
None ever heard why he went there,
Though it was understood—
Like many who went otherwhere—
’Twas for his own land’s good.
But just which his own land might be
Was matter for debate ;
A riddle that we often see
In folk who don’t run straight.
He said he was American,
But was his statement true ?
For never was Columbian
More like a German Jew.
It matters not; though I can give
A reason why he sought
As heir of Washington to live
Amongst these brown untaught.
It helped him greatly to defeat
Such malcontents as knew
What tares he placed amid the wheat
The missionaries grew.
For, as no Yankee Consul flew
Old Glory in that nook,
It was not very easy to
Bring Schweinheim’s store to book ;
Though Germany and England had
Their Agents and their law,
Their shadows o’er their people bad,
To bode and overawe.
Adulteration; selling drink
To natives on the sly,
As, in the murk of night, they slink
The spoiling shanty by;
Short measure, but gross over-charge—
All kinds of dodgy “ do ”
Far, far beyond fair trading’s marge.
And punishable, too,
By Mister Schweinheim (may his soul
Know warmer weather than
Was current where he levied toll
Upon the Sons of Tan !)
Defiantly were practised, while
No justice there could cope
Effectually with the guile
Of one outside its scope.
So waxed he fat and flourished, though
His dupes were on the wane ;
So stacked he bottles, row on row,
Of alcoholic bane
In varied kinds ; but that most spilled,
The thrice-starred “ wash-me-down,”
Was “ Schweinheim’s Special Scotch,” distilled
In ancient Hamburg Town.
Its chemical constituents
. Were puzzling to assess,
Though in its reek of mingling scents
Lurked, here and there, a guess.
Potato-spirit, I’ve no doubt,
And fusel-oily things
All blended in a stir-about
Beyond imaginings.
Such as it was, it met the mart
To which it had been brought—
A seller, quite devoid of heart,
To buyers without thought.
Nepenthe to the flotsam and
The jetsam of life’s tide,
We nicknamed it “ Beachcomber Brand,”
The mean white’s suicide.
Of all the drinks I ever drank
(And I have drunk galore),
None ever could make life so blank
As those at Schweinheim’s store.
And though, since shifting years have passed,
This rascal may be dead,
Or, on a fortune ill-amassed,
To other scenes have sped,
I know of kindred sinners that
Do business in his way,
From Island unto Island at
The Gateways of the Day ;
And if you wish to understand
The meaning of D.T.,
Go, sample the Beachcomber Brand
Down in the Southern Sea.

The habit of procrastination is strong in human nature. A
slight indisposition—a feeling of being a bit “below par”—
is given very little heed to, with the result that alarming
symptoms often ensue. It is a truism that most sickness

“In reply to your inquiry re the Card Concentrators purchased from you two years ago, I Kaye much,
pleasure in stating that these tables have been in constant use for the past eighteen months, and have
given every satisfaction. They have not cost £5 in up-keep and repairs, are still in good condition, and
working smoothly and well ; the work being cleaner, more regular, and results generally much better than /'
the other concentrators running by their side. I can confidently recommend the Card Concentrator for l
effective, clean and good work, at a minimum cost of up-keep. T. WEBB, General Manager.** /
