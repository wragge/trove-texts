This Blacking is in liquid form and is applied to shoes
or other articles of leather by means of a sponge, attached
to the cork by a wire, so that the blacking can be used by
anyone without soiling the fingers. No polishing brush
is required. It dries immediately after being applied, and
will not soil the most delicate clothing.

The extraordinary reputation of Rowland’s Macassar

offer spurious imitations under the lure of being cheap;
the principle on which each is prepared is confined
solely to the knowledge of A. Rowland & Sons, of 20,

necessary to buy no Macassar Oil. Kalydor or Odonto

I Dr. M. PERRTT,
M.R.U.S., L.S.A , &c.,
SPECIALIST for the Treatment of Nervous
Complaints, Diabetes, Tumors, &c.
Registered by the Medical Bo ird of N.S. W. Late Home Sur-
geon t > the Great Northern Hospital , London.
I am aware that I am not strictly following: the paths
Of professional etiquette by advertising myself as a
Specialist for the tieatment of this class of disease, but,
unfortunately for the suffering public in Australia, the
apathy shown by Qualified Mon in the treatment of
Chronic and Norton* Complaints has induced men of the
lowest grade of intellect (whose only qualifications are
unlimited assurance) to spring up, and by specious
advertisements and false promises trap the unwary.
It is very evident that sufferers from these diseases
have been scandalously treated by these unqualified
persons The evidence taken at the Medical Enquiry
held in Sydney (published in the Daily Telegraph , Nov.
6th. 7th and Bth, 1890) plainly shows the disgraceful
manner in which patients are duped. Not only are
they robbed of their money, but what is of infinitely
greater importance, their health is injured also. It is
therefore time that Legally Qualified .lien entered the
field to fight these peats ®f society with their own
weapons, viz., Advertising.
It is utterly impossible for those who are suffering
from thc.-e disease*, who are scattered over nil parts of
Australasia, to ascertain which Qualified Practitioner
makes these diseases his speciality unless he advertises.
I consider, therefore, that by advertising I not only
strike a blow at the Quackery which now exists, but I also add
to the usefulness of my profession and in no way lessen my
personal dignity.
My Qualifications I Invite the fullest Investigation Into. For some considerable time I was House Surgeon to the
Great Northern Hospital, London, where I had special opportunities of observing the many phases of the Nervous and
Sexual System, and to become acquainted with the most scientific methods of ellectlng their cure. , , ,
My sole attention is given to the treatment of these diseases, and when a person consults me he is Informed at the
commencement whether I can effect his cure or not. The patient is not deluded with false and specious promises, and
If I undertake the case
S Absolutely Guarantee a Complete and Permanent Cure.
My great success in the treatment of these diseases enables me to give tins guarantee without fear.
ELDERLY MEW, MEW, AW» Y«! S« MEW
Suffering from Impaired Vitality should send for my Work on Diseases of the Reproductive Organs, which, in addition to explaining
my method of treatment, contains many useful hints ns to Self Management , the observance of which is of great use to all, and in many
instances is sufficient to check the progress of disease. This Book will be forwarded Free on application.
Patients residing at a distance can be treated at their own homes without interruption to their business. Medicines packed and sen
free from observation to all parts of Australasia.
Varloeele quickly and permanently cured without operation. Diabetes and Tumors treated by a totally new method of Cutaneous

IDTJCHAfUS
This eminent Specialist, Founder, and Chief
Surgeon of the long-established and favourably-
known Dispensary that now bears his name, re-
ceived his medical education in the leading colleges
and hospitals of Europe. He has devoted a life-
time to the study of
PRIVATE, NERVOUS, AND SKIM
DISEASES.
He has by profound research thoroughly investi-
gated their origin, traced their deadly sources and
insidious dissemination, and ascertained the surest
and safest methods by which they may be eradi-
cated, with these widely recognised qualifications
combined with unswerving faithfulness to his
patients, he has during his practice, extending
over FORTY YEARS, attained a well-deserved
pre-eminence in their treatment. His practice
embraces diseases which probably cause more un-
happiness than any other class of troubles that
afflict mankind.
YOUNG MEN
who suffer from the results of early follies, trans-
gressions or excesses of more nature age, bladder
difficulties, a whitish or dark ropy sediment in
the water, accompanied by slight burning or
smarting sensation, Headaches, Drowsiness during
the day, circles round the eyes. Giddiness,
irregularity of the bowels, specks before the eyes,
bashfulness, discontentedness, weakness or pains
in the back. Liver or kidney complaints, dreams,
buzzing noises in the ears and head, pimples, a
fear that something dreadful is about to happen,
weak stomach, yellow or blood-shot eyes, impure
blood, hasty, uncontrollable temper, hacking
cough, who cannot marry, nervousness in society,
wakefulness, palpitation of the heart, genera!
weakness, and other symptoms which lead to in-
sanity and death, should consult him, for he has
mastered these difficulties. On receipt of fid. in
stamps he will send secure from observation in a
plain wrapper, postage
FREE, A LARGE CLOTH-BOUND
BOOK.
Showing plainly how all diseases of the private or
nervous system may be cured thoroughly and per-
manently without unnecessary ok pence. This
book will prove a valuable companion, and, even
though you be perfectly well its general inform-
tion and prescription may assist you in restoring
some poor friend to health even after his case has
been pronounced incurable by his medical at-
tendant.
ONE POUND IS SUFFICIENT TO
SEND
for Remedies necessary for the cure of NER-
VOUS DEBILITY. Should you require medical
treatment, as procrastination is sometimes dan-
gerous, it would be advisable for you to sit down
quietly in your chamber and write to the doctor,
detailing every experienced symptom. He will
on receipt of such a letter, write you, promptly
and courteously, a candid and straightforward
oponion of your case. If you do not think you
understand the case, send for his famous medical
work, the price of which is but sixpence ; enclosed
in the volume will be found a list of carefully-pre-
pared questions, which will, in all probability,
assist you materially in describing your ailment.
Dr. Richards uses nothing but the purest remedies,
and never prescribes mercury under any circum-
stances. The moment letters are carefully per-
used and answered they are destroyed by fire,
and patients may rest assured that their cases
will remain a secret between the doctor and
themselves. Dr. Richards has successfully treated
nearly 25,000 cases since coming to Australia, and
I permission from at least 10,000 persons to
show their written evidence of his success. All
communications should be addressed

SATURDAY, FEBRUARY 7, 1891.
“Move On!”
It is a somewhat ominous coincidence that
Parson Langley, of Sydney, and Parson
Booth, of the, world at large, should have
simultaneously struck the same remedy for
the same disease, for the remedy is likely to
be a good deal overdone in consequence.
The pastor in the blood-and-lire shirt pro-
poses to cure the chronic distress of Britain
by exporting a select gathering of British
paupers to work on farms in Australia, and
almost at the same moment the pastor in the
sombre tail-coat proposes to cure the chronic
distress of Sydney by shifting another
gathering of local “ unemployed ” to work
on farms somewhere in the interior. In each
case it is only a new variety of the same old
nostrum ; the philanthropist never, by any
chance* attempts to find and remove the
causes of poverty—his one invariable pre-
scription is that the poor must be “ sent ”
Somewhere in the hope that they may at last
strike a Paradise where work is plentiful,
and wages abundant, and where the labour-
market is not overstocked, and there is no
Vvant or suffering of any description. It is
true that the unemployed difficulty is raging
everywhere* from Australia to Iceland, “and
from Chili to Labrador, and in every country
there are too many labourers and too little
employment, and the policy of emigration
has degenerated into an aimless swapping of
inhabitants t hat leads to no visiblegood results.
It is impossible to suppose or to believe that
the two parsons are not fully aware of these
facts, but the force of habit was too strong for
them. Some day, possibly, their theory will
be worked out to its logical conclusion, and
then the world at large will go in for the
systematic export of all its other diseases as
well as the disease of hunger, and the Aus-
tralian with typhoid will be exported to
Brazil, and the Brazilian with yellow fever
will be shunted off to Australia, and the man
with a broken leg and a damaged spine will
be sent to Japan instead of to the hospital,
and the person who has been run over by a
cab will be despatched to Northern Queens-
land, and there will be a general exchange of
incurable tumours and abscesses and similar
properties. At present, however, this policy
is only in the earliest stages of development.
The individual who is broken up by hunger
and want of employment is sent into the
country, or into some other country, where
things are a shade worse than they were in
his original home, and the person who is
broken up through a wall falling on his head
is treated on the spot, whereas a more
reasonable and philanthropic course would
be to run him into the next State by
means of a barrow or an ambulance, and
leave him there.

According to Pastor Langley’s scheme of
benevolence the unemployed of Sydney are
to go out into the wilderness and devote
themselves to agriculture, and according to
the scheme of Pastor Booth the unemployed
of London are to do likewise. In each case
it is assumed that when the poor take to
growing food they will be placed, at least,
beyond the reach of starvation, and thus, in
theory at least, all the distress on earth can
be alleviated without any alteration of exist-
ing social conditions, by the simple expedi-
ent of sending every hungry citizen out into
a waste place, where he may grow carrots
and other wholesome refreshment and be at
rest. But in practice this project breaks
down miserably. If land was absolutely
free, and food was the one essential —if the
agriculturist could go hatless and unshod and
naked, and if he never wanted to have his
hair cut—if there was neither rent nor taxes,
nor any other liabilities whatever—then the
plan of exporting the poor into the wilder-
ness as a cure for poverty might produce
admirable results. But, unhappily, the
agriculturist finds money an absolute essen-
tial, and it can only be obtained by the sale
of his produce, and as the world can only
buy and pay for a certain fixed and limited
quantity of agricultural produce at the best,
anything in excess of that limit is absolutely
valueless. The benevolent scheme which the
Reverend Booth proposes to adopt on a large
scale in England, and which the Reverend
Langley proposes to follow on a small scale
in New South Wales is practically founded on
the assumption that all the superfluous por-
tion of the human race can resort to agri-
cultural pursuits provided the opportunity is
allowed them, but in reality there is no more
an unlimited demand for agriculturists than
there is for mesmerists, or prize-fighters, or
policemen. It is as reasonable to propose
that all the unemployed of Sydney should at
once take refuge in the Church or the Law
as that they should take refuge at the plough
or the harrow ; the demand for carrots and
the demand for poetry are equally incapable
of expansion beyond a certain point.
* # #
The world already produces almost as much
food as it can reasonably consume, and even
if the whole human race enjoyed three
square meals every day, it is questionable if
there would be any deficiency.* Famines, it
is true, are plentiful enough, but they arise
solely through want of money to buy pro-
visions—the provisions themselves are there
in abundance. Even in the awful years of
hunger in Ireland some two genera-
tions ago, when a hundred thousand
human beings perished from absolute want,
Ireland, fed by American war-ships, actually
exported vast quantities of grain and dairy
produce to England and elsewhere. The
failure of the potato-crop loft half the Irish
population penniless, but still they starved
in the midst of abundance, and died only
because they had no means wherewith to
purchase even the smallest portion of the
plentiful supplies that were leaving the
country by every seaport in order to pay the
demands of the grasping absentee landlord.
Similarly in the year of the great Indian
famine, India was still one of the principal
food-exporting countries of the globe, but
the Hindoos died off in incalculable numbers
because the landowner and the tax-gatherer
had to be satisfied first, and after these two
British cormorants were filled there was
nothing left. In no civilised country upon
the earth does poverty arise through want of
food, and the idea of abolishing poverty by
employing the hunger-stricken masses on the
land is as hopelessly impracticable as the
idea of reaching the same end by employing
them in making boilers. If the world’s food
supply is doubled by creating an artificial
boom in agriculture, the poor will be as poor
and as hungry as they are to-day ; and if the
supply of boilers is doubled the results will
be just the same.
* * *
But despite these obvious facts it has
become the fixed habit of modern philan-
thropists to assume that poverty and all
kinds of human trouble arise solely from the
inability of the sufferers to reach that un-
specified region where work is plentiful and
wages abundant, and where every toiler sits
down beneath his own vine and wattle-tree,
and is at rest. Nobody ever seems to live
or to have lived in this region, and nobody
knows definitely where it is : but everybody
agrees that it is not where he is himself but
always where somebody else is, and conse-
quently the one great anxiety of the Chris-
tian is to send his unfortunate brother there
—wherever it may be—and let him find his
pathway strewn with flowers and things
generally, overflowing with milk and honey.
Therefore the kind-hearted inhabitant of the
plains lends his assistance to shunt his
suffering friend into the city, and the kind-
hearted inhabitant of the city becomes filled
with sympathy and shunts his suffering
friend out on to the plains ; and the
humane cornstalk citizen sends the
poor on to Melbourne that they may be
tilled with happiness and bliss, and the soul-
ful preacher of Adelaide gives them another
lift in the name of the Loard as far as
Perth, and everywhere the results are the
same. The land of poverty is everywhere
and the land of plenty is nowhere ; and
every industry from the Law and the
Church down to the humble stone-breaking
pursuit, is equally overstocked. And yet
when a new philanthropic movement is
initiated the object is always to send the
“ unemployed ” somewhere else, while the
real evil lies in the fact that everywhere two
men are endeavouring to do the work of
three because they have to maintain the
landlord and the capitalist and the middle-
man as well as themselves, and as the
amount of profitable employment is strictly
limited the other man must necessarily be
left out in the cold.
The “Supreme” Court v. the Privy
Council.
Says the Argus, dealing with the Messer v.
Gibbs titles ease, in which the Victorian
Registrar of Titles successfully appealed to the
Privy Council against the Victorian Full
Court
“ It is undoubtedly somewhat of a shock to local lesral
prejudices, to find the considered judgment of Mr.
Justice Webb— probably the ablest of our equity lawyers
—confirmed as it was by a Full Court, consisting of'Mr.
Justice A'Beckett— another skilled equity judge—the
Chief Justice, and the late Mr. Justice Kerfbrd, upset by
the Privy Council, seeing that the act to be construed
was of colonial origin, and the practice surroundin'' the
case a purely local creation.”
Quite so, but the Argus will soon recover.
The shock is not of sufficient voltage to have
any deadly or lasting influence on the Melbourne
heavy-weight. Instead of going into the merits
of the case, as the Argus does, the proper
question to ask oneself in this case is, whether
appeals should be made by our Governments,
under any circumstances, to what is practically
a foreign Court. The judges of the Privy
Council go into a case of this kind absolutely
ignorant of colonial statute law, and, as the
An Toy case shows,. quite ignorant of our
constitutional rights. This appealing to the
British lawyers is a growing habit in Victoria.
Miss Starr’s case was decided against the
Victorian Government, and the equity of the
decision of our Court was at any time as plain
as some of the members of the Cabinet of that
day. The Gibbs case, above noted, came next,
and now the Chinese case is sub judice.
# # #
Apart from the shocks at the result of a
specially-imported verdict there is another and
a greater shock which has been overlooked by
the Argus. That is the shock caused by the
expression of want of confidence by the State in
its own Supreme Court, which is shown by the
act of appealing from its decision. Supreme
did we say ?—what court is there in Australia
that is supreme, except, perhaps, in a Hiber-
nian sense? Just look at an American example.
Their Supreme Court has powers higher than
those of any Legislature in the land. It can set
the President and Congress at defiance, and
from its decision there is no appeal. Law is
supreme in America. But in Victoria, Higin-
botham and Webb and A’Beckett, men whose
character and knowledge of the law which they
administer are unquestioned, are practically
told by the Government of the land in which
they form a Supreme Court that if their jiidg-.
ments are not subservient to the policy of the
day strangers will be called in to reverse it !
* * #
Arguments on the merits of the cases ob-
scures the great principle that the Australian
Governments should abide by the decision of
their respective highest Courts, even at the risk
of hardship. If that decision be against their
contention or their ideas of policy or injustice,
it is open to them to pass an Act to prevent
the recurrence of a similar case. It would be
unpleasant, for instance, to admit that we
could not prevent an influx of Chinese, but if a
majority of our Supreme Court say that under
our present laws we cannot, it is much more
dignified and conformable to national feeling
to alter the law than to appeal to the Privy
Council. It would, perhaps, be futile to legis-
late so as to prevent such appeals, for while we
are connected with Britain the Crown could
hardly be expected to assent to an Act that
would deny the supremacy of Imperial Courts
in any part of the Empire, but it should be
asserted with no uncertain sound that Govern-
ment appeals to the Privy Council would be
vastly more honoured in the breach than the
observance.
Imperial Federation Again.
The question of the future of Australia has at
last been satisfactorily and definitely settled.
It may now be neatly tied up in a piece of
bright red tape and put away in a pigeonhole,
to rest undisturbed till the day of the last
trump. Lord Carington has put the case in a
nutshell. Australia never wants to separate
from dear old England, not she. Australians
don’t want any voice in the management of the
Empire, not they. They are perfectly happy
and easy in their minds so long as the House of
Lords is there to look after them. Why should
they want to fuddle their brains about the
steering of the ship of state, and all that
nonsense ? The British lion is at the helm and
the white ensign is at the peak. Hip, hip, hip,
hooray !
The colonists knew that England would regard the
invasion of Australia in the same light as they would the
landing of an enemy in Kent. England would aid Aus-
tralia against a foreign foe, even if Canada objected: and,
on the other hand, England would not wait the consent
of Australia before sending, if required, cruisers flying
the white flag to the Bay of Fundy or. to the Behring Sea.
* * #
That is the sort of stuff they cheer at the
Colonial Institute. It is adjusted with mathe-
matical precision to the intellectual calibre of
an assemblage whose character is so innocently,
but conclusively, sized in the Sydney Morning
Herald’s cabled enumeration of the most dis-
tinguished notabilities present—The Prince of
Wales, the Earl of Granville, the Duke of
Fife, Lord Knutsford, and Mr. James R.
Fairfax. (We can’t restrain here a paren-
thetical burst of brotherly journalistic pride
in the modest shrinking spirit of self-
effacement with which the S.M.H. introduced
three unimportant names between those of the
Prince of Wales and “Mr. James.”) It is
another proof of Lord Carington’s power of
taking the measure of his audience that he did
not feel called upon to give them anything new.
The Bay of Fundy outburst did duty as part of
his last speech at the Sydney University nearly
12 months ago, and was received with so much
loyal fervour by Sir William Manning, Gover-
nor Hopetoun, and other representative Aus-
tralians who had seats on the dais, that he
evidently thought it good enough to put by in a
cool place to keep till it could be dished up
again for English use. And, to tell the truth,
it is not at all bad—for a lord. It sums up con -
cisely and comprehensively pretty well all that
can be said in favour of the fashionable English
idea of Australian loyalty. “Be a good little
boy and cheer the dear, good Queen, and we’ll
see that the naughty Russian doesn’t bite you.”
Unfortunately the little boy is getting sense
enough to see that if ho didn’t cheer the Queen
the naughty Russian wouldn’t want to bite
him.
* # . #
The Australian mind has been clearing itself
rapidly of late years, and one thing it has
very definitely made itself up about is that
Australia is not going to long continue
the English connection on the present
lop-sided basis. We do not propose to
spend money on forts and ironclads to light the
enemies of England, without knowing what the
light is about. If England gets into a quarrel
over her own private concerns, we have to
suffer for it; and as it is no business of ours,
England ought to stand the racket. And we
don’t propose to go in for any slobbering
gratitude about it either. Even if England
had no trade out hero to protect, she has no
right to let Australia be damaged in an affair
which Australia had nothing to do with. If
Lord Salisbury- wants to fool along into a war
with the United States over a boatload of cod-
fish, let the people whose ballots put him into
power pay the piper. Who made him a ruler
over us ? If we are to shoulder our muskets,
it must be at the bidding of our own chosen
leaders, and not of somebody who governs an
island on the other side of the world, and who
only happens to govern it because five years
ago some hundreds of thousands of voters
shared his views on the propriety of propa-
gating loyalty in Ireland with the point of the
bayonet. If the British Government is to
plunge us into war, we must have access to the
ballot-box that creates the British Government.
That, in short, is the case for Imperial
Federation.
* * *
And a very good case it is, ex-Governor Car-
ington to the contrary, notwithstanding. It
would be an unanswerable case if the only
alternative were a continuance of government
from Downing-street. But it is not the only
alternative. The present system is an impos-
sible one, and shows signs of an impending
break-down in about 13 different places, but an
Imperial Federation wouldn’t carry things
much farther, even if it could be set going.
The Australian party in the federal senate
would be the antitype of the Irish party in the
House of Commons—only getting attention to
its most vital concerns by the persistent ob-
struction of all other business, and then being
ruthlessly clotured into silence. That little
difficulty certainly wouldn’t take long to settle,
but we don’t see the need of having to settle it
at all. England need not worry herself over
any prospective “ Australian question.” When
the Australian question arises it will be dealt
with by the independent Australian nation.
That is why Australians don’t get up any
enthusiasm about Imperial Federation. Im-
perial Federation would only be the half-way
house on a roundabout road to the Republic,
and Australians are not in the habit of going-
round when anything is to be saved by taking
the short cut.
PLAIN ENGLISH.

Two Women and a Do g.
This world is all a stage, and the Devil is the
scene-shifter, and Nemesis is the property-man,
and the Furies take the money at the door and
look after things generally. Here are two acts
from the show which we quote in justification
of this view
Colonel North, the nitrate
millionaire, who recently
paid £BSO for a single dog,
keeps a large number at
Eltham, where the kennels
are sumptuously fitted up.
There is a doctor’s room,
where a dog who has a
slight cold or other ailment
is immediately attended to.
There is a cloak-room ; the
dogs’ coats cost about 10s.
each. In the feeding-room
you see shoulders of mutton
and prime pieces of beef
weighing about 281 b. each.
Another glimpse ol East
End life (and death) was
afforded by an inquest held
by Coroner E. Baxter on
the body of Elizabeth An-
stead, 34, a single woman,
lately-residing at 13 ('aider
street, Bromley. Mary Ann
Anstead, an old woman
scarcely able to walk, stater
that deceased was hei
daughter. They lived to
gether, and deceased usee
to work at shirt-finishing,
at which she earned 3s. pei
week, and sometimes not
that. Witness was allowee
2s. 6d. per week as outdooi
relief, and" this representee
their total income. The>
paid 2s. per week rent foi
their room, and lived ant
clothed themselves out tv
the other 3s. 6d. The de
ceased lived chiefly on breat
and butter. On Monday
morning she was worse, ani
she died the same night
The Coroner: “ This sort o'
thing goes on all the wee!
round, yet people seem tc
think there is no poverty h
the East End.”
To be a hardworking English female is a pool
way of earning a living, but it is obviously a
grand institution to be an English dog. Yet il
Elizabeth Anstead had applied for a billet as
one of Colonel North’s dogs she would probably
have been rejected with derision because it was
her misfortune to be only a human being—the
glorious prospect of being an £BSO dog was
closed against her by the iron decrees of fate,
and she never had a show because she couldn’t
bark. Looking at the matter from an economic
standpoint, it would be interesting to know
what is the cause of human beings in England,
and whether any steps are being taken to eradi-
cate them. In a country where a woman and
her mother are only worth 3s. a week, while a
dog, altogether apart from its mother, is worth
£BSO, it is obviously unprofitable to grow
women at all. The dog, we presume, would
get on perfectly well without them—at all
events there are evidently more women than
any dog can possibly require ; for instance, no
dog or dog-owner seems to have had any visible
or conceivable necessity for the ancient Mary
Ann and her offspring, and under these circum-
stances it is difficult to imagine why they
existed at all. < Probably neither of the miser-
able females could have thrown any light on
the matter if the question had been put to


them, and it is quite certain that nobody ever
thought it worth while to put the question to
either of them. And now that one of them is
gone, no one seems any the poorer, and if the
other one would only go likewise the parish
would be two-and-sixpence a week better off,
and the only thing they have left behind them
is this arithmetical problem : If an English
woman is a dead loss of Is. 3d., and a dog is a
profit of £BSO, how many women, according to
the laws and customs of British Christianity,
would require to be killed in order to save
enough money to keep one fashionable pup
dive ? The Nation of Shopkeepers would do
well to look into this point. A race which is
wasting its time in raising unmarketable human
beings—for exportation to the Australian dust-
heap —when it might devote itself to the culti-
vation of a dividend-paying mongrel, has wil-
fully shut its eyes to the main chance, and has
forgotten the great axioms of Trade.
The Deceased War-Scare.
That old European war-scare which has seen so
much hard service in recent years seems to have
died a natural death, and been reverently put
away in the grave. It did much good work
while it lasted, but the venerable bogey got
worn-out in the end and crumbled away. For
nearly ten years the energetic cable-liar sent
along his unassuming paragraph about three
times a week, stating that the day of unmiti-
gated smash was at hand, and the car of Jug-
gernaut, or something equally imposing, was
about to burst out from its retirement and
squash the world into an unpleasant mass ; and
generally the world believed the statement and
waited anxiously for the yell of the political
volcano that was always going to explode to-
morrow. The trouble had a good many
different shapes. Sometimes the uncle of
somebody who was dead was hovering about
an inaccessible mountain in Asia, and at
other times there was a bold statement
to the effect that some hazy individual had
been seen in Bulgaria and “ serious complica-
tions were expected. ” Generally somebody was
gathering an army on a frontier somewhere,
and at other times somebody presented an
ultimatum which was never heard of after-
wards ; and, whatever else happened, it was
generally understood that the ‘ ‘ war-cloud ”
must burst at an early date because all Europe
was in arms and howling for the fray. Yet it
never seemed to dawn on anybody that when
France and Germany, or any other two
Powers, have two million soldiers each
they are no more likely to fight than if they
had only 40,000 —in fact, they are a good
deal less likely to do so, because though
men are plentiful money is lamentably scarce,
and the average European exchequer would
give out before the enemies could be brought
within gunshot of each other, and even the
preliminary skirmish would have to be fought
on tick. If the Great Powers maintained only
one soldier apiece, war would be practically
incessant on account of its cheapness; if they
had six millions, war would be about extinct,
for even an autumn manoeuvre would leave an
empire insolvent. The “bloated armaments”
which have grown up during the last 20 years
have kept Europe quiet, for they are too heavy
to be dragged about with impunity ; and there
was never any war-scare at all except in the
lying cablegram, and the “ war-cloud ” was an
old, worn-out myth, and the “prevailing un-
easiness,” and tbe “strained relations,” and
the rest of the literary material were mostly
infamous bosh. When the Whitechapel fiend
and the great London strike got into full blast,
the cable fiend forgot, in the pressure of busi-
ness, to keep the ancient wheeze going any
longer, and when he had no time to telegraph
about impending wars, the wars ceased to
impend right off. The great diplomatic com-
plication broke up because no one had leisure
to read about it, and probably many a genuine
war could be broken up in the same fashion, if
the parties chiefly concerned would go right
along with their business and take no notice of
it whatever.
Freedom of Contract.
There is now in type, and shortly to be issued,
a work that for some time past has been
urgently needed by the capitalist employers
and their organs, the capitalist press. Its full
title is to be “Anew and revised dictionary
of words and terms in common use relating to
the pretensions of the labouring classes.”
The object of the book is by supplying
a set of amended definitions to save sub-
sidised journalists the exhausting labour
of proving at great length whenever
any labour troubles occur that ordinary
English expressions mean what they want them
to mean. An unfortunate delay in the issue of
the work has put the daily press to great in-
convenience in dealing with the dispute between
Vicars and Cos., of Sydney, and their child-
employes A simple definition of this kind—-
“ Freedom of Contract—-the right of the em-
ployer to impose his own terms on his own ser-
vants ” —would have made the leader-writer’s
business easy. It is confoundedly hard lines on a
poor pressman to expect him to make out that
it is a violation of the principle of freedom of
contract for wage-earners to say that they don’t
choose to work for a given employer unless he
reinstates a fellow wage-earner who has been
in their opinion unjustly dismissed. This is
what the daily press calls “intolerable dicta-
tion.” Perhaps it is ; but that doesn’t make it
any interference with freedom of contract.
‘ Intolerable dictation,” by the way, is a term
with a pretty variable meaning. A thing is
intolerable when you can’t put up with it. That
depends on how much you can stand. For the last
40 or 50 centuries the labourer has stood the most
damnable oppression, simply because he has
had to stand it. To-day he is learning the
virtue of combination, and is beginning to tell
his employer that he won’t stand it. That is
what, in the employers’ jargon, is called “in-
tolerable dictation. It is intolerable so long
as the employer can't stand it. He will soon
learn in his turn that he has to stand it. When
he has taken that lesson properly to heart, it
will be a convenient time to commence putting
freedom of contract” on a fair basis. Meanwhile
and pending the contemplated revision of the
English language, freedom of contract means
the same for one side as the other. It means
that the employer may offer work on his own
terms, and refuse to employ anyone except on
those terms. It means, on the other hand, that
the wage-earner may propose what terms
he likes, even as to the men he chooses
to wmrk with, and refuse to accept
employment if his terms are not agreed
to. Freedom of contract, in short, means
that no contract need be entered into that is
not acceptable to both sides. And it means,
therefore, the right to either side to hold out
until the other side finds it more advantageous
to give in than to hold out any longer. That is
the philosophy of strikes. It will take a lot of
new dictionaries to convince the level-headed
workers of Australia that there is anything
inconsistent between a strike and the freedom
of contract that a strike is at present the only
means of enforcing.
♦
The Departure of Capital.
Every time there occurs anywhere in Australia
a disagreement between Capital and Labour,
the Tory press raises a discordant howl to the
effect that Capital will presently be driven out
of the country, and Australia will go to ruin in
consequence. Asa rule, three-fourths of the
Australian nation becomes scared at this in-
telligence, under the influence of a vague,
shapeless impression that Capital has hitherto
done something for them, and that when it is
driven out it will cease to do that something,
and, consequently, everybody will be left.
There is something large and wild and ominous
about this oft-repeated threat, and though
nobody knows exactly how Capital comes to a
country, or what it does when it is there, or
how it leaves again, or what happens when it
does leave, and though nobody ever heard of
Capital leaving any country unless it had picked
the bones of that country absolutely bare, the
mere suggestion that something of an impres-
sive nature is about to happen has a certain
awe-inspiring influence upon the country in
general. The next time the old wheeze comes
to the front, however, it might be as well if
that section of the press which props up the
interests of wealth would explain itself a little
more fully. The Capital of Australia—as of
every other country—consists almost entirely
of buildings, land and mineral deposits,
and as these three things are not of a
portable nature, they, at all events, will
not be driven out at present. The fences
and the tanks, the waterworks, harbours,
roads, breakwaters, wharves, railways, tram-
ways, and similar objects will not rise up and
quit, and though cattle, sheep, and horses are
more or less removeable, they are nob suffi-
ciently so to start off en masse for England—
the country where Australia’s liabilities are
mostly situated, and to which its assets would
naturally depart when the foreign investor quits
Australia in disgust. With regard to the float-
ing capital of the country, it consists largely of
money invested on good “ shecurity ” and at a
high rate of interest, and if it should give way
to unreasoning panic at some future date and
take unexpectedly to flight, it must inevitably
leave the interest and the “ shecurity ” behind
—in other words, the capitalist may go, but the
capital must remain. When this substance
desires to make a dignified exit, the first essen-
tial is to realise on the investment by passing it
on to some other speculator, but in the general
retreat, which is so frequently foretold, and
which never comes to pass, it will be impossible
to sell to anybody, and consequently capital
cannot leave even if it tried. It might leave
just sufficiently to cut off a great part of the
supply of imports, and thereby it would
create a great boom in Australian indus-
tries ; and it might also make a general
realisation at a sacrifice of 90 per cent, or there-
abouts, and thus relieve Australia of a great
burden of debt at a very low figure, but beyond
this the effort to drive out foreign Capital
seems about as hopeless as the attempt to drive
out the mountains. Therefore, the next time
the horgans of wealth announce to the work-
men of this country that their conduct must
inevitably drive Capital out of their native land,
they might also explain the process by which it
goes out of any land, and how it looks when it
is going. There have been many cases in which
Capital was destroyed by war, neglect, mis-
government, or other causes, but the spectacle
of this solid substance solemnly packing up its
carpet-bag and departing with tears in its eyes
is one which the world has never yet witnessed.
At the present moment it is making a stupen-
dous effort to leave the territories of the Ar-
gentine Confederation, though it went there
quite recently, but to the great grief of the
British investor three hundred millions of it
has got stuck and won’t come out. And that’s
what is the matter with the Barings. *•
Glimpses of our Republic.
SIDE-bursts towards the full freedom of an Aus-
tralian Republic are constantly “ centrifnga-
lising. ” The latest prominent indications have
inhered in the question as to whether or not an
Australian colony is a sovereign state—that is
to say, whether a colonial Government can con-
stitutionally commit an act of sovereign power.
Asa matter of dry existent law, an Australian
colony is simply a British dependency, yet there
are Australian Premiers who demand and even
grasp certain powers that utterly ignore this
fact, while the Imperial Government is wise
enough to handle certain questions gingerly
and to shelve them if possible. In the Ah
Toy appeal case the Privy Council simply
shirked the great constitutional question in
which Victoria was interested. Had the
Privy Council declared that a colony could
perform a sovereign act, it would have
established a precedent and displeased China—
that “ conuug Power” which it is now recog-
nised British policy to conciliate. On the
other hand, had the Privy Council formally
ruled in precise and forbidding terms that a
Victorian Government could not perform a
sovereign act, it would have set the colonies
“ all on end,” though it placated China. From
a British point of view, the question was wisely
evaded. Premier Munro now desires to have
the Imperial recognition of his contention tha t
each colony should be able to execute commer-
cial treaties on its own account with Foreign
Powers. This is the same blister in another
place, and, naturally, John Bull would avoid
direct dealing with it. Diplomacy has infinite
resources. A late cablegram from London
reads: “ France refuses to recognise the right
of Victoria to terminate the Postal Convention
concerning the transit of Australian mail
matter through France, except through Britain ,”
&c. France is thus put up to answer the chal-
lenge to which Great Britain could not safely
respond.
■ o
Hopetoun’s Fudge.
Under the exciting influence of an A.N.A.
banquet, Gov. Hopetoun seems to have lost his
little head for a moment on the recent anni-
versary of Transportation Day. Plunging
wildly into the dangerous subject of “ loyalty,”
this pallid young gentleman remarked that
“Of course, now and then, people let a word
or two drop which was foolish, but he
did not think they meant very much. The
best proof that they lived under a free
system of Government was that they were
allowed to utter such sentiments without
receiving punishment. If in France or America
any fellow got up and made a speech in favour
of getting a king on the throne of France, he
would be seized there and then by a couple of
policemen and walked off to the nearest lock-
up. ” Verdant folly is its own punishment in
this world, and we may assume that Hopetoun,
when he found that even the obsequious handful
of Natives there present had no cheers to uree
him further along his benighted way, felt sorry
he had spoken. Anyway, he stammered, looked
pitiably uncomfortable, and sat down suddenly,
explaining that he wouldn’t occupy any more
time. Whereupon the Natives broke into a
ruminative “Hear, hear.” Australia expects
little of its Governors, nor wants that little
long, but those ornamental personages are at
least required to remain as unobjectionable as
possible, and refrain from slandering institutions
more enlightened than those they represent.
Without considering the sense or otherwise of
Hopetoun’s assertion as referring to France
—a country where a few howlingly
Royalist or Buonapartist newspapers are
still published and a few interested rogues
or gratuitous idiots still drink to the health of a
visionary king or emperor at public dinneis—
we will lake the callow lordling on the American
question. No Australian has ever been heard
to “let drop a word or two” in favour of a
Republic like that of France, which, though
the deliberate choice of the people, exists only
on the sufferance of a large standing army, and
is as yet a long way from being free in fact.
But America is a name ever on the tip of the
democratic tongue —the one constant reminder
that kings, courts, lords, perpetual pensions,
and the thousand and one vanities and infamies
attachingtomonarchical government are laughed
to scorn by the great Nation of the West. Now,
when Hopetoun affirms that a man who “ got
up ” in America and proposed to crown some-
body King of the United States would be
arrested by two policemen, his Excellency
makes a statement which, coming from a man
of experience and intellectual ability, would be
a monstrous lie. Coming from a gentleman who
twice failed to pass a simple military exami-
nation it is merely an honest proof of his ignor-
ance and lack of brains. True, a crank getting
up the President’s chimney, or in a church
during service, to propose any political resolu-
tion would undoubtedly be removed witli
violence like the stranger who recently
wandered into Government House, Melbourne,
and dumped himself down upon the vice-regal
sofa. But Hopetoun’s words inferred that an
American Royalist—supposing such a creature
to exist —would be in danger of imprisonment
for ‘ ‘ treason ” if he aired his ideas at a banquet.
What is the young man giving us, or, rather,
our Natives ? Herewith The Bulletin gets up
to say that Lord Hopetoun drivels, and that he
is himself a proof that Australians do not live
under a free system of government, inasmuch
as no free people would import a Governor from
the other side of the globe to make a miserable
exhibition of the fact that he knows nothing
and is incapable of concealing his ignorance.
And although we utter such sentiments without
fear of an indictment for treason, we do
solemnly record our conviction that for this
immunity from dungeon, torture, and legal
murder we are by no means indebted to persons
of the Governor class. Hopetoun’s speech to
the Natives insinuated that Australian Repub-
licans may think themselves very lucky, you
know, that they are not seized by two police-
men and punished. In short, Hopetoun is not
only a driveller, but an impudent driveller at
that.

Bradlaugh lived to know that the motion by
which he was so long kept out of his place in
Parliament had been expunged from the records
of the House. The “disreputable Atheist” of
1880 became a revered sage by efflux of time.
If Respectable Cant had a conscience, which it
hasn’t, what a number of “ old geesers ” would
blush as they remember that only ten years
have passed over their fat heads since they
thought the heavens would fall if Bradlaugh
were allowed to sit in Parliament without
kissing a Bible ! By the way, he did scramble
forward and kiss the Bible after a while. Where-
upon Cant, officially represented by the Speaker,
ruled that the kiss of an Atheist wasn’t sacred,
and Bradlaugh was cast forth into the outer
darkness to gnash his teeth for a further spell.
And now the House unanimously agrees that it
was a bigoted ass ten years ago, also, that a
man who regards swearing by the Bible as a
played-out mockery is not bound to be damned
hereafter, and that if he be damned, he will
probably find himself better off than in the
heaven of orthodox believers. The old geeser
kind of person never does think back (nor"think
forward for the matter of that) but simply
swears that everything of the moment is founded
upon glorious precedent, and cannot change for
ever and ever, amen, The present historian,
though still almost young and blooming, delights
to revive recollections of the times not so very
long ago, when Parnell, with his half-a-dozen
followers, was popularly regarded as a wild
Irish curiosity, to be greeted with parliamentary
jeers and cock-crows whenever he started to
speak. Randolph Churchill, about the same
period, was represented in the press as a
ridiculous joke, a vivacious lunatic who had
created a “ Fourth Party ” of four, just for the
fun of being called its leader. Bradlaugh—
well, lie was a disgusting blackguard, you
know, trying to get amongst a lot of gentlemen,
and being very properly slung out. Outside,
Respectable Cant always spoke of him as though
he were a political inebriate hammering at the
door of a grog-shop, and cursing “something
dreadful,” because they had refused to allow
such a degraded character on the premises.
Where is the middle-aged Tory that can deny
these hard facts lightly told?
Dear Bulletin, —Your correspondent who*
under the nom de plume of “ Jackass,”
draws attention to the contrast be-
tween the early Australian explorers and
Stanley, is quite right in most of the
deductions he draws, although there are
one or two instances he might have omitted.
Burke, for instance, who was fitted out with
as gorgeous a retinue almost as that of Stan-
ley, had no reason beyond his own incapa-
city for living or rather dying on nardoo.
Eyre’s famous tramp round the head of the
Great Bight was the result of his dogged deter-
mination to get through at all costs, even
though he knew that no geographical discovery
could be the result. Stuart was certainly as
fine an example of a self-reliant Australian
explorer as could be brought forward. With
but a small party and scanty outfit he reso-
lutely tackled the continent again and again,
and was really the first to cross from
ocean to ocean, for Burke simply got as
far as the head of a mangrove creek and
never saw open water. But the man who
towers above Stanley in quite heroic contrast
is Charles Sturt. Not altogether in the
physical privations undergone, for he but bore
his part therein with the rest, but in his
moral superiority to the buccaneer of Africa.
When Sturt pulled down the Murray he knew
that, if ever he returned, it would only be after
terrible toil and hardship, for there was no
hope of relief meeting him if he succeeded
in reaching the goal of his hopes, the
mouth of the river. Stuart too was in the
same predicament, but with him the difficulty
of return was not enhanced ; while with Sturt
the extra labour of returning up against the
river, compared to going down, would be,nearly
quadruple. Again, he and his party might, at
any moment, by the wreck of their boat, be
left on foot, and almost helpless in what was
then nothing but a hungry desert; from
the terrors of which Sturt had before been
forced to retire. In spite of all this
we do not find the leader exhibiting
any of the querulous peevishness, the
childish jealousy, and the contempt for native
human life that lias blotted out all Stanley’s
better qualities, whatever they might have
been. The tone breathed right throughout
his journal is one of earnest, modest desire to
fulfil his mission, to do justice to the heroism
of his comrades, and to avoid, even at the
risk of his own life, spilling the blood of the
ignorant natives. And yet this man, whose
deeds were so great, whose services to Aus-
tralia are beyond reward, whose record is so stain-
less, is left unhonoured by Australians, while
the Brigand Stanley finds friends in ”oyal
palaces. — Delcomyn.

“ The colonists knew,” says Baron Carington
at the Colonial Institution, “that England
would regard the invasion of Australia in the
same light as they would the landing of an
enemy in Kent. England would aid Australia
against a foreign foe, even if Canada objected ;
and, on the other hand, England would not
wait the consent of Australia before sending, if
required, cruisers flying the white flag to the
Bay of Fundy, or to the Behring Sea, so as to
enable colonists to feel that they belonged to
the British community. ” Which, being inter-
preted, simply means that England wouldn’t
hesitate to breathe fire and slaughter in the
Bay of Fundy at the expense of involving Aus-
tralia in a war, about the merits of which the
latter country might know and care nothing,
but which would all the same serve as an invi-
tation to a host of flying Yankee pirates to
come and stick us up. Suppose, -after England
had sent her cruisers to the Bay of Fundy and
declared war against the States, it became plain
to the world that J. Bull was in the wrong,
how could Bull aforesaid expect the Austra-
lians to sympathise with him as against the
Yankees, who, as we are reminded by Imperial
officials at every Fourth of July banquet, are
also part of “ the great Anglo-Saxon com-
munity ? ”

“ Give the Australian Chief Justices life-peer-
ages,” says ex-Governor Carington —who him-
self is an hereditary lord and not a mere life-peer.
Baron Smith thus considers the magnates of the
Australian bench unfit to be admitted into the
sacred circle of born “nobility,” of which he
himself is a lustrous ornament, or else he re-
gards the whole system of hereditary nobility
as a sham. Leaving the Baron to wriggle on
the horns of this dilemma, we may proceed to
remark that the two largest-minded and most
popular men now on the Australian bench,
plain George Higinbothan and Sir Charles
Lilley are both loudly-avowed Republicans,
and that the former would not accept a title
even if it carried with it a million a year. The
Australian democratic idea does not include
“ My Lord Chief Justice Darley,” but it cer-
tainly does include stripping Chief Justice
Darley and Chief Justice Way and all the rest
of .the Chief Justices of their wigs and scarlet
robes and other imported upholstery Austra-
lia has admiringly heard of President Andrew
Jackson who, after his election as President of
the United States, rode unattended and in a
grey tweed suit to Congress on his old white
horse and hitched it up to the gate; and who when
he had made his speech in Congress quietly
walked out and unhitched the old white horse
again.

Pericles and Parnell—A Parallel.
Few would venture to compare the condition
of Athens under the rule of Pericles, when
there were displayed an intellectual activity
and a progress in art unexampled in the world's
history, to the condition of Ireland under the
rule of the “uncrowned King,” when ruin,
desolation and poverty brooded over the land ;
and yet the similarity not only in the principles
and policy of these great leaders of men, but
even in the minuthe of their character, is truly
remarkable. Both sprung front aristocratic
families, deserted the class to which they
belonged, and placed themselves at the head of
the people : they chose rather to solicit the
favour ot the multitude and the poor than
of the rich and the few, Pericles,
like Parnell, was cold and reserved
and shrank from publicity and popularity ; ho
avoided all social entertainments and recrea-
tions, believing, like the Irish leader, that,
“freedom of entertainments takes away all
distinction of office, and that dignity is but
little consistent with familiarity.” It is but
necessary to make a few extracts from the
translation of Plutarch's “Life of Pericles”
to show the remarkable parallel that exists
between the leader of Athenian democracy
during the days of Athenian supremacy and
that “very remarkable man” (as Gladstone
called him a few years ago) who during the last
ten years has guided the. destinies of a down-
trodden and oppressed people ;
Pericles took care not to make his person cheap among
the people, and appeared among them only at proper
intervals ; nor did he speak to all points that were debated
before them, but reserved himself for greater occasions ;
despatching business of less consequence by other orators
with whom he had an intimacy.
Substitute Parnell for Pericles and every-
one conversant with the politics of Ireland will
admit that this extract gives an exact account
of the policy which Parnell has followed from
the day when he was first elected leader of the
Irish party to the time when cant split his
party and left him but .'l5 parliamentary fol-
lowers.
Such was the solicitude of Pericles when he had to
speak in public that he always first addressed a prayer to
the gods that not a word might unawares escape him un-
suitable to the occasion.
History does not record that Parnell offered
up such a prayer before bis speeches in West-
minster, but we have it on the authority of the
G.O.M. that he had the power of saying exactly
what he meant and that he possessed a thorough
grasp of his ideas and wants. Mr, Gladstone
once said of him :
No man, as far as I can judge, is more successful than
the hon. member in doing that which it. is commonly sup-
posed that all speakers do, but which in my opinion few
really do—and I do not include myself among these few—
namely, in saying what he means to say.
Thucydides represents the administration of
Pericles as favouring aristocracy, and tells us
that, though the government was called demo-
cratic, it was really in, the hands of one who
had engrossed the whole authority. Can it not
with truth be said ol Parnell, oft dubbed
Dictator, that he, too, engrossed the whole
authority, and often left his aspiring lieutenants
in ignorance o| his policy and programme ?
They accused him of an intrigue with the wife of
Mexippcs, his friend and lieutenant in the army.
Mutatw muUmdix this, too, will apply to the
“ discrowned king.”
The Lacedaemonians, persuaded that if they could
remove Pericles out of the way they should be better
able to manage the Athenians, required them to banish
all execrable persons from among them ; ajid Pericles.
was by his mother’s side related to those that were pro-
nounced execrable in the affair of Cylon.
How curiously like the present state of things
in Ireland, when Respectable Cant tries to
hopnd ou,t of public life the “ execrable ” Par-
nell, in order that it may be better able to
mapicLge the Ipish ?
There is always a good show in. Australia for
t,he well-dressed malefactor who snuffles when
he is run in, and brings evidence to prove that
he went wrong from the mos’t pious motives.
For instance, at Daylesford (Vic.) a plain and
consistent Christian w;as hauled up, the other
day concerning two separate assaults on a
young lady, aged fifteen, and was convicted on
both charges. In, fact, he acknowledged the
whole affair witjh a meek, cherubic snule, and
explained that he only assaulted the girl to
“ ascertain whether she was a person of good
character whom, he could safely allow to asso-
ciate with his own daughter,” and the Bench,
in consideration of this noble sentiment, let
him off with a fine of £lO. Apparently the
Daylesford beaks think it quite a reasonable
thing that a Christian inhabitant should go
round assaulting his daughter’s female friends
to find out if their characters are perfectly cor-
rect. And yet, if a bricklayer is charged, upon
v ery shady evidence, with molesting any kind
of a female in order to ascertain whether lie can
associate with her without injury to his morals,
what a thundering row ensues right off!

The New South Wales Supremo Court will: be
closed until 16th February, when the first term
of 1891 will open. The judges have had
holiday vacation since 23rd December last. The
number of remanets since last year and the
accumulation of legal work during the long-
drawn-out vacation will demand good manage-
ment, apd vigorous work at the hands of the
judges, as only three working weeks are
allowed, —for jury trials— i.e. , for clearing off'
the arrears of last year and the present accumu-
lation before the Sittings cease and the judges
go on circuit. Many cases awaiting trial must
therefore go over to the June Sittings, nearly
six months from the present time and about
nine months from commencement of the action !
Affairs in the District Court arc in a correspond-
ingly unsatisfactory state.

“ The Idler,” albeit it was not hailed on
first night with the extraordinary enthusiasm that
a bright play written by an Australian might
expect, has caught on at Sydney Garrick. The
story is of one Mark Cross (name suggestive of
illiteracy) who hopefully returns from burying a
wicked wife abroad to find the girl his position
had prevented him from wooing, the wife of
another. He then discovers that he had formerly
known her husband, Sir John Harding (Ed. Sass)
as “Euchre Jack,” and reminds him how the law
has not relaxed its efforts to capture him for the
slaughter of a man in a drunken Californian
brawl. Curtain. In the next aot, Cross sools
Simeon Strong (Laurence Cautley) brother
of the murdered man on to Harding, acquaints
Lady Harding (Olga Nethersole) with her
husband’s danger and makes her complaisance
the price of Harding’s safety. Curtain.
Then he works on Strong’s gratitude (he had once
saved his life) to obtain the emancipation of Hard-
ing ; this secured, he attempts to trade it away
with his friend’s wife in exchange for her virtue.
Her purity and fearlessness save her, but she has
not time to escape ere her husband, coming to
consult Cross, discovers her fan, denounces and
deserts her. Curtain. In the final act Harding
compels Cross to face him with pistols, but they
are interrupted by Strong, the American, who
gets between them in a manner which lacks the
dramatic quality of abruptness. Theotheisrush in
and explanation is followed by reconciliation. Then
Cross is patted on the back by Strong and
requested to take command of an Arctic expedi-
tion. He wavers and, left alone, meditates suicide,
but, checked by the sight of his mother’s portrait,
refrains and orders his valet to pack up. “ Where
for, sir ?” says Hans Phillips (he got a big recep-
tion on first night). “ For the North Pole ”is the
reply, and the curtain goes down on an anti-
climax. The author has clumsily interpolated a
comedy underplot from which all the lighting-up
effects are eliminated by the heavy-wet Merry-
weather of Harold Russell and the cold, cute
self-consciousness of Mary Kingsley, who is not
built after the ingenue pattern. Haddon Chambers
is evidently a close student of Sardou, for “The
Idler,” distinctly French in style, at once
suggests “ La Tosca ” and half-a-dozen of the
latter’s masterpieces. Its weak points are a
straining after Rochefoucauld ism, and a crude-
ness chiefly made evident in the want of homo-
geneity apparent in characterisation. Cross, for
an instance, a mean and contemptible cur as ever
lived, is, apparently, accounted rather a magnani-
mous if misguided person by his creator, and the
whole crowd do and say things totally at variance
with any previously-formed conceptions of their
dispositions. Cross is a very difficult part to
play. Cartwright -certainly* didn’t look it,
nevertheless, he managed to smooth over
its incongruities and infamies in a wonderful
style. Olga Nethersole was equal to every re-
quirement of a not excessively exacting part.
Like many others we did not like the boldness
with which she ratified the assignation by tossing
her bouquet to the feet of her tempter. \Ve think
the struggle between fear for her husband’s safety
and her own, virtue, would have been more
artistically displayed by a gradual loosening of
her grasp on the flowers and their gentle fall to
the ground. Emma Cwyne is realistic as the
man-hunting widow ; Jenny Watt-Tanner as the
motherly, good-natured one. We nearly forgot
to mention the Harding of Ed. Sass, a character
run somewhat on Lord Jura lines, and ably
handled ; also the Strong of Cautley, an anything
but impressive performance. After Friday week
the company skip to Melbourne Royal, where
they open in “The Fortune of War,” a specta-
cular drama. The vacancy at the Carriok will be
filled by the Turners in opera.

“Comrades,” now running at Sydney
Criterion, seems scarcely an improvement on the
weird wail that preceded it. As our knowledge
of the piece is confined to a brief sniff at the pro-
gramme ere departing in haste to view sundry
other shows, permit us to remark in curt fashion
that this story is a reversal of the prior one. The
question now is not as to how an illegitimate may
be legitimatised, but in what fashion a legi-
timate may be kept in ignorance of his
legitimacy. This complication, mingled with
the machinations of an elderly female and
ill-stuffed, early-slain poodle in the hands of a
clever company keep folks alive, whereas if in-
differently handled it might have driven the
part-author, B. 0. Stephenson, in front on Monday
night, out to apprentice himself to the boot-
closing. Next week we’ll have time to say some-
thing nice about the show.
*****
“ Arrah-na-Pogue,” up for six nights only,
is staged and scene-painted as well at Sydney
Royal as if intended to run for a month. It is
also fairly well cast, though Robert Inman as the
C’Crady and Constance Deorwyn as Fanny
Power are ill-suited. Everyone was agreeably
surprised by the Arrah of Miss Appleton. She
won the audience first with her good looks, and
held them captive by her tender sweetness and
utter want of staginess throughout. The Michael
Feeney of Charles Seagrave is a good perform-
ance on the conventional lines, and the Kitty
Walsh of Maggie Oliver (always reminiscent of
the other Maggie); the. Beamish M'Coul of
“Bob” Stewart, are all right. Nevertheless the
show hasn’t taken Sydney by storm, and it might
have been better policy, financially considered, to
keep on the pantomime. “Daddy” Lehr. who
represents the “Poguey Man” in front, informs
us that the “Irish Detective,” as previously an-
nounced, goes up on Saturday night .

Theatrical managers don’t seem to under-
stand human nature. In pantomime all the
women are made up to look like houris, while the
men partake of the complexion of satyrs. This is
good biz. for the women on the stage, bad for
women off; good for the men in the audience,
bad for the men on the boards. Women go to
theatres to feast their eyes on the beautiful, just
as men do; gazing only on the lovely of their own
.'lex they soon get cloyed. An American writer
complains of the thin arms and thick legs of t h ■
ballet. “ Pads !” says he. That does not follow ;
the feminine leg, in most cases, is fully developed
by rope-skipping, rinking, dancing, block-walk-
ing, while the arms never know exercise or
useful employment —the man does all the
hugging. All this reminds us that the panto-
mime is still running at Her Majesty’s to ex-
cellent houses. The professional matinee of
Saturday was highly successful, and at the impe-
cunious children’s gathering of Monday, gallery
and family circle were filled to overflowing, and
hundreds turned away.

Manager Larmour’s performing seal, at
Coogee Aquarium, considerably disturbed the
bathers there by darting in among them the other
evening. Afterwards, he scared the ladies by
waltzing over the dance-floor on his fantastic fin,
and closed an exciting day by clambering up a
20-foot wall and flopping heavily into the roadway
on the chest of an apple-woman. Had he fol-
lowed this programme on the eve of the publicans'
picnic, lots would have yelled: “ Fan tods : got
’em again ! ” Donovan and Parker fight here on
Saturday week for the mounted sword champion-
ship on the lawn at 3 p.m. The dances of Wednes-
day evenings continue to boom.

At Sydney School of Arts a complete
change of programme and the accession of Phoebe
Levy as a skipping-rope dancer and, in conjunc-

At Bondi Aquarium Professor Fernandez
has made two very successful ascensions and
earth-leaps. That of the moonlight night was
especially beautiful. The balloon went straight
up out of the little glen with the skyward rush of
a rocket, till it caught the wind, when it drifted
towards Coogee. Then the Professor, who was
hanging by his heels distributing bills, struck a
fusee, re-lit an extinguished lamp that was pen-
dant from the parachute, and shortly afterwards
made his jump. At first he shot downwards like
a falling star, then, when the parachute opened,
hung for a brief space m mid-air clearly silhouetted
against the skyline and came gently to earth.

Dr. Carver’s “Wild America” opened at
Moore Park on Tuesday and gave two perform-

Not having seen the showq it is impossible to say
how many glass balls were broken by the doctor’s,

Sydney audience.

Business is as good as ever at Sydney
Cyelorama, in fact, Manager Beresford informs
us that despite the great recent, expenditure,

J. L. Toole is fading away like a flower at
Melbourne Opera House, and the production of a
series of comedies for one successive night or so
fails to attract much attention. No more does
Melbourne evince a burning desire to seek the
bubble reputation even at the pay-box’s mouth.
Altogether, the Prince of Wales’ pal has
played ten weeks on the banks of Yarra Water,
and he is now not caviare but “dry hash ” to the
general. The Bulletin takes no credit to itself
for having foretold J. L. TVs inability to last out
a long season in any Australian city, firstly when
his engagement was announced, and secondly
after he had started at the Princess’s. London in
the bulk is not much addicted to patronising “ the
little theatre in the Strand ” (and an uncommonly
little one it is) where Toole runs his little show for
jaded aristocrats, sporting acquaintances, and
those worthy people who take him on his news-
paper reputation, and are pretty easily amused.
The latter start laughing even before their idol
puts in an appearance. The exquisite humour of
his knock at the door senfls them into convulsions.
New-chums who have snorted at adverse criti-
cisms upon this overrated artist are for the
most part very young men who knew “ Toole ”
only as a name at “ home,” and have no idea of
the fortunate combination of circumstances by
which he has been enabled so long to figure, off
the boards, as the most excruciatingly funny man
of the English-speaking world. He fairly earned
a reputation in the old days, since when, good
luck, good tact, and the social effects of a good
heart, have relieved “Johnny” of the necessity
of moving with the times. Apropos to the fare-
well banquets tendered to Toole by somebodies*
and would-be somebodies, before he left England,
the Referee wondered whether Australians
would expect to find in the actor histrionic talent
commensurate with the fuss made about his depar-
ture, and, if so, what the Australian public would
think of Toole when they got him. After getting
a good deal of him, they seem scarcely to think
about him at all. Nevertheless, he is a far better
comedian than many Melbourne folks, who cannot
disassociate the star from his feeble satellites,
seem to imagine. In the “ Spitalfields Weaver ”
and many other old-fashioned farces, again as
Mawworm and similar characters of the oily
antique kind, J. L. Toole wants a lot of beating
even now. And we maintain this notwithstanding
that Albert Edward’s devoted admirer desires to
have The Bulletin “suppressed.” Believing
itself to be as honest, well-meaning, and a little
more humorous than Toole, The Bulletin has
no desire to see him suppressed. On the contrary,
this magnanimous journal trusts that lie will long
live to play small practical jokes and cultivate by
degrees those radical principles which would do
him such a lot of good. Toole takes his farewell
on Friday, as the Artful Dodger and a few other
things :
On Saturday (7th) the Gourlay-Snazelle

pany capable of making the best of available

Other theatres are continuing as before.
The Royal Pantomime, still doing good business,
will run for another fortnight, and “lolanthe”
will continue to pop up through the watercress
and shake the tadpoles out of her long blade
tresses until Saturday when “Princess Ida"
comes again to teach us that lovely woman soon
tires of interposing stone walls betwixt herself
and perfidious man.

As for “Dr. Bill,” that retired rake is
filling the Bijou everywhere and always. Anson"'
contortions, when he learns that his better,
stouter self is locked in the bath-room with a male
person of pedigree unknown, are alone worth the
money. Miss Myra Kemble, too, works well
throughout the second act, and Brough throws in
at least one unmistakeable touch of nature. His
anxious exhortation of Myra to “pull herself
together, ” as she lies fainting on the sofa, carries
one back in imagination to Bill’s bachelor days.
He seems to speak as one accustomed to see fair
creatures “go off” unexpectedly, and the old
guilty dread that his companion may possibly
start screaming, is perceptible in the tremor of
his voice, “Pull yourself together”—how often
has he said the same thing, in his snug little
study, with its Turkey carpet, inviting couch in
the corner, and curtains drawn close !
The giddy ladies’ doctor.
Afraid that he has shock’d her,
Uncertain of his patient, and how far he ought
to go,
Cries “Pull yourself together ! ”
The while he wonders whether
The pretty dear has fainted, or is shamming,
doneherknow.
Annie Taylor, Cecil Ward, and Emma Temple,
whose performance of the fast young person is tin
refined essence of spices, absorb most of the re-
maining honours. But the Kangaroo Dance is
sometimes prolonged until the laughter wanes.

At the Alexandra they may be able to
hold back “The Miner’s Right” for another
week, inasmuch as “The Black Elag” flourishes
considerably. Darnpier’s fight with four warders
is not so desperate an encounter as it might be,
but the violence with which those miserable myr-
midons fall over without due provocation is, on
the whole, a qualifying mystery. Besides, the
prisoner’s escape from Portland is the making of
the “ Flag.” It brings about a wonderfully quick
change of scene, and perhaps the best representa-
tion of a boat tossing on the waves that has been
seen in these parts. The mechanical rocking in
the cradle of the deep is most ingeniously managed.

All three halls are tenanted just now. At
the Gaiety they have “fifty handsome ladies,’’
more or less, and a burlesque of the Wild West.
The minstrels at the Vic. have been strengthened
by a Wonder Worker and a Witch, while Madame
Cora, described as Australia’s Favourite, has
returned from a long, weary tour of the world
to practise illusions and mesmerism at St. George’s
Hall. Madame’s illusions are mostly of long
standing and undoubted respectability, but her
mesmerism looks uncommonly thin at the first
hasty glance. The Waxworks is doing well with
the improved loud Telephone, and the Battle of
Waterloo is taking place around the road to
Brussels, as usual.

Sydney D.T. theatrical criticism :
Wonderfully well dressed in a richly-flowered gown of
sulphur-coloured silk, this Lady Harding seemed fit ex-
cuse tor the wildest passion.
Perhaps the D.T. critic’s experience has been
exceptional, but wo have generally found that wild
passion—that is to say, we don’t know anything
about it personally, but we have been credibly
informed the ladies who excited that sort of feel-
ing succeeded best without—in short, that won-
derfully well-dressed women—hang it, we mean
that it wasn’t usually the sulphur-coloured silk
that did it.
Good-bye, J.L.T.,
May you meet no gales
As you cross the sea
To join the Prince of Wales;
Should he ask—“ The Press
Exalted you, I trust ? ”
Reply—“ Well, I confess
The Bulletin was Just.
“ It sometimes gave me jam,
And sometimes marmalade.
And sometimes it said ‘dam/
I’m very much afraid.'
But O ! 1 do declare
It prints some awful things,
And doesn't seem to care
A little bit for kings.
So bitter are its sneers
At those I dearly love;
It doesn’t look on peers
As angels from above ;
It never has been taught
To reverence the Crown—
I really think you ought
To put that paper down.”
Good-bye, Johnny dear,
Remember us to Turn;
He will be glad to hear
You made a tidy sum.
We wish you well indeed,
And, with a friendly grin,
Exhort you still to read
The good old Bulletin.

Says an ingenuous and socially ill-informed Now Zea-
lander ; —“Madame Marian Burton, the much-admired
vocalist now in Auckland, is a married lady and her hus-
band travels with her. It may he a further shock to the
‘chappies’ who are so hopelessly in love with the beauti-
ful singer to learn that she is now in that condition in
which ladies love to be who love their lords. Madame
Burton has resolved, after the present brief concert
season is over, to remain in Auckland until after her con-
finement, which will take place within a few weeks.”
What will they say in England?
Toole announces the sale of the Australian rights for
all pieces—such as are his property—which reminds us
that he oo.uldn’t act his favourite Butler here, because ho

their original “Caste,” and the other Robertson plays.

writes now “ For the satisfaction of anyone interested in

Rogers!), “ kindly allow'me In state that I never did or

pose.” And this from the man who has nauseated the
press for the last three years with all sorts of details about
his wife’s lovers, husbands, presents, petticoats, and
garters.

“ Little Joe Brown ” now adorns the Sydney pro-
menades, after a recent brief sojourn in Melbourne. A
Bohemian from the latter place arrived in Sydney sud-
denly, the other day, when he and Joe met. “ Hulloa,”

Boohsa, the great eccentric harpist, died in Sydney 35
years back, after running away with Anna Bishop, and
breaking Sir Henry Bishop’s heart. But Anna’s last visit
to Australia was as Madame Schultz, her hubby an ugly,
iron-grey-hair man, in a fur cap, with that combination
of grey hair and black moustache, which is the correct
make up for Brigard in Frou Frou. Of course Boohsa
was ugly as sin, with a mug like a springbok, or buoh-
billi, and of course Sir ’Enry was a very fine man—May
and December. Bochsa didn’t survive him long, but
Anna did a very long time—time to get shipwrecked
often.

The French Government have given Sardou’s new
drama, “Thermidor,” a prodigious reclame, by ordering
the expurgation of passages reflecting on Robespierre,
the Incorruptible’s memory being cherished by the Reds.
The play is wondrously exciting, about that famous day
in Thermidor when Robespierre was overthrown through
the rebellion led by Tallien. There is a woman every-
where, and all Robespierre’s democratic and sanguinary
enthusiasm arose from his being jilted by Mdlle.
Deshortis, a wealthy aristocratic heiress, in Arras, where
he came from. Another woman procured his fall,
Madame Tallien, then Countess de Fontenay. She egged
on Tallien to head the conspiracy against Robespierre,
who had resolved on killing Tallien, while he kept the
Countess in prison. Tallien saved her at Bordeaux, but
she ultimately deserted him for the Banker Ouvrard, and
then married the Belgian Prince de Chimay. We are
just on the Centenary of the crisis in the French Revo-
lution.
There is something light and refreshing about this
little idea. In Madame Tussaud’s Waxworks the latest
attraction is a facsimile of the sitting-room of Mrs.
Pearcey—recently hanged for the murder of a woman and
an infant —with pictures, couch, piano, and everything
complete. Also the murderess is thrown in without any
extra charge, her duplicate in wax being represented in a
standing position in the centre of the apartment. The
blood-stained perambulator, in which the corpse was
removed, is likewise on exhibition, together with the
jacket worn by the prisoner the day she demolished her
adversary, models of the heads of the victims, and the
piece of toffee which the baby was sucking when Mrs.
Pieroey suddenly wiped it out with the household axe.
In fact, the only thing that is wanting is the milk
that the same infant would have drunk next day if it had
survived.
Dick Stewart, Nellie’s dad, still adorns the Melbourne
pave, coming up brisk and smiling. He was certainly
a remarkably good actor at the time when he made such a
wonderful Dundreary to Jefferson, in “ Our American
Cousin,” and followed it up with an entire contrast as his
Uncle Pete, in “ The Octoroon,” but latterly he got very
mannered, so that his left leg was thrust into all his
parts, like Charley Mathews’.
One of Sothern’s least unpleasant practical jokes was a
simple mystification, which took the victim thoroughly
aback, but for others he ought to have been kicked.
Well, in this case he began by getting an envelope sent
all round England, until it was covered with the names of
post towns, being passed on from one friend of his to
another, with pencil addresses. Then he addressed the
envelope in ink to a fashionable stranger in London, with
an invitation to dine—three months old—whereupon the
stranger pitched into the P.O. authorities for their
stupidity.

Janet Aohurch got a tremendous send-off from Auck-

strelsy of the music hall “ artiste ” and the burnt-cork
nigger. Why and whence the difference ! Whence and
why but that the first two nations have feelings and
capacities which the third has not.

The Henley-Stevenson play, “ Beau Austin,” produced
at London Haymarket on two Monday nights by Beer-
bohm Tree in pursuance of his design to try new plays
after this fashion, was hawked about among the various
English managers for years ere it got this show, and was
played in America, unsuccessfully, under another title.
It is brimful of tears, and its names were, apparently,
selected from a line in Scott’s fine ballad of “ Young
Loohinvar for every character, bar “the Beau,” has been
christened either Foster, Fenwick or Musgrave. It is
suggested that it would be more appropriately named,
“May a Man Marry his Mistress?” with the sub-
title : “ May a Woman accept Matrimonial Re-
paration from her Betrayer ? ” According to the
authors the answer to both question is: “Yes
—if it be shown that the man truly loves the vyoman,
that he is prepared to suffer shame and humiliation for
the outward maintenance of her honour, and if it is some-
thing more than a belated effort of that
prompts his action.” Critics say that “ Beau Austin ”is
superior in merit to ninety-nine successful plays out of
every hundred, but altogether without acting dramatic
interest. Therefore, Beerbohm Tree’s statement on open-
ing night that in staging this and kindred works “We
shall not consider the commercial aspect of the case of
the first importance ” has its consolations.
Signor and Signora Majeroni arrived in Sydney from
Hongkong by the Chang-Sha last week. Both, everyone
will be sorry to hear, have been seriously ill, indeed,
Majeroni has lost nearly three stone in weight since
leaving Australia. This loss of weight is, no doubt to an
extent, a consequence of the anxiety and worry caused
by the serious condition of the Signora, who caught
pleurisy at Agra, while they were viewing the interior
after a highly successful Indian season. Somewhat
restored by the attentions at Bombay of Dr. Sydney
Smith, the great specialist, the Majeronis then visited
Singapore, Hongkong and Shanghai, where the Signor
played to big houses, assisted by amateurs. Signora
Majeroni, though otherwise restored, is unfortunately
deprived of her voice, through paralysis of a vocal chord,
for the time, but Dr. Piaschi expects that complete rest
will restore it eventually.
J. J. Foster, manager for Henry George, Bemenyi and
others in the colonies, is giving society concerts with the
latter in London. Among other notabilities catered for
he mentions the Duke of Cambridge, the Ear! of
Londesborough, Colonel North (the hitrate King), the
Prince of Wales, and many of the West End clubs ; also
at the German Athenaeum, Les Bon Freres, the Lyric,
Meistersingers and Grosvenor “ Ladies’ nights” meeting
with great success. Mr. Foster has secured a six weeks’
guarantee engagement for Hungary, M. Remenyi’s native
country, opening in Buda-Pesth, the capital, on 14th
Feb. ; also a 25 weeks guarantee from the Redpath
Bureau for America, commencing in New York on 15th
Sept. next. The gap between these two engagements will
be filled up touring Continental Europe. During Mr.
Foster’s stay in London he has been made an F.R.G.S. in
return for his valuable geographical contributions to that
Society.
Charles Dillon, the elder, used to relate an amusing
experience he had when in Australia. He was due in a
certain city which boasted two theatres, the managers of
which had been in treaty to secure him for the same date.
He closed with one. After a tedious journey he arrived.
The first thing that attracted his attention was a huge,
burly man blazing with jewellery, and shouting “ Which
is Charles Dillon ?” The actor timidly introduced himself.
“Thank Heaven ! I was afraid you wouldn’t come, and
isn’t the other manager riled ;he tried hard for ye. What
do you think he’s going to do to spite me? Why, play
‘The Ticket-of-Leave Man.’ ” “Is that such a big draw,
then?” “Draw be hanged! No. It was arranged
between us that the confounded piece should never be
done ; but he’s going to play it because he knows I am
an old lag myself !”
Henry Irving once received a rather severe snub from
the elder Dillon. The latter was playing a very unprofit-
able engagement at “The Lane,” while Irving was on the
full tide of success at the Lyceum"with “Hamlet.” It
was “ Treasury Day,” and several of Dillon’s pals—most
of them old-timers—surrounded him in the private bar of
the Wellington Tavern, which was next to the Lyceum.
Enter Irving—“ Glass of sherry, please.” While drinking
it he observed Dillon. Approaching with a respectful yet
confident air, said he: “ Good day, Mr. Dillon—fine
weather, eh?” Dillon quietly surveyed him with a who-
the-devil-are-you gaze. “ Perhaps you don’t recognise
me. j—er—played Horatio to your Hamlet at the Theatre
Royal, Manchester, er—er —twelve years ago.” Dillon
pondered with a pompous, puzzled air for some time. At
last, seeming to recollect: “Yes! yes! of course—l re-
member now*. Let me see—your name’s Irving—yes, yes.

Says Nym Crinkle, in discussing the reasons that gave
Mary Anderson a leading place on the boards“ With
measureless advantages of arms and voice and stature,
Mary Anderson has never warmed anything. Her mis-
sion was horatory. She came to us with the untamed
vibration of the Kentucky presiding elder, and the first
thing she did was to preach Pauline at the Fifth Avenue
Theatre, and fill the parquet with mourners’ benches.
She had imbibed the singular notion in the West that
histrionism consisted in using a contralto voice below the
staff, and in telegraphing her ideas with her arms. She
was so unlike any other artist that the world had ever
seen that we got to calling her ‘ our Mary,’ in recognition
of her proud distinction.” Another writer, taking up
the parable, declares that “Mary was superb, like a
monolith, with something of that object’s crystal hard-
ness. But, unlike Cleopatra’s Needle, no storms could
affect her surface. She was stately, oratorical,
statuesque; and some, who had examined her more
minutely than others, said she bad a white soul. She
was superior, impressive, emphatic. Her carriage was so
ample it drove over rhetoric like an old-fashioned post
coach, and the critics swung on her gait like truant
schoolboys.”
This is how they keep cool in the Bowery, New York.
On a calico sign over a dirty doorway you read: “ Great
bathing panorama. You get a bath and a breeze insidfe
for ten cents. Coney Island outdone. Nymphs, mermaids,
and real women disporting themselves in real water. The
greatest sight of the century.” You enter a long, low
room crowded with a sweltering mob, whose eyes are
fixed on the little stage that fills one end of the tunnel-
like apartment. There, a strip of badly-daubed border
represents the sky, and a jagged piece of pasteboard the
laughing ocean, while two large fans that give no breeze
creak noisily from the wings. Behind the ground-border,
which barely conceals their calves, a number of women
wearing a single are cutting capers in the
water and throwing pulverised salt over one another’s
shoulders, in the fashion of girls that splash about at the
real sea. After a series of evolutions too peculiar and
emphatic to permit of careful description, a whale, not
quite so large as the bathers, floated into view, and, amid
screams of fright, the monster opened his jaws, and the
most succulent young woman of the gay group w’as
eno-ulphed—all except her limbs, which protruded from
the whale’s lips and kicked violently as the curtain fell
over the graphic picture.
I IThey did say that Sarah S , Edinburgh’s lady, intro-
duced to him by Standish and Cos., had the royal arms
tattooed upon her, but this is discredited, though there
was a white woman in Melbourne, not long ago, tattooed

out of the same house as Sarah, the notorious Mrs. ’s.
Noticing “ Ohilperic,” a Melbourne daily paper says
that if anyone does not appreciate this lively farrago, it
must be taken as a proof that Providence never intended
that person to go to the play, and the writer twice refers
to Providence as “she,” which is petticoat government of
the universe with a vengeance.
Nellie Stewart, says an Adelaide paper, is to get a
salary of £7O weekly at London Gaiety. Nellie isn’t
going home for financial betterment, then ? By the
way, Svdney Echo quotes from a Melbourne paper to
show that George Musgrove’s trip to Europe is wholly
unconnected with the circumstance that Nellie Stewart
wings her way there by the same ship.
Pantomime, although apparently appreciated, doesn’t
seem to pay in Brisbane where, the other day, there was
an awful burst-up with “The Forty Thieves” crowd at
the Theatre Royal. From published accounts it seems
that Frank Beverley appealed to Frank Whyte, who held
a mortgage over the show, for his screw. The coin not
being forthcoming the comedian proceeded to punch
Whyte in the street. Sequel: Police court case, and
numerous sensational pars, for nothing.
There can be no two opinions on the accuracy of the
late Dion Boucicault’s assertion that the dramatist, unlike
the poet, is evolved out of experience, and is not a born
genius. The main difficulty in theatrical authorship lies
not, as is generally supposed, in the elaboration of an in-
teresting plot, but in its rendering into concise and fluent
dialogue: or, in a word, in reproducing the entirety of a
novel in a condensed form without losing an atom of the
flavour. That this task requires much practical training
unquestionable.

authorities sent for the use of himself and his one

It is ludicrous to see a Sydney evening-
paper publishing as original an obviously Ameri-
can short story; also, a three-quarter column
humorous sketch, written for and published in,
likewise paid for by The Bulletin months ago--
and certainly not written by the man who has the
cast-iron impudence now to fasten his name to it.
in justice to ourselves, who practically inaugurated
the system of paying for original matter in
Sydney, we mean in future to show, on every
possible occasion, where these unblushing pirates
get their “ original ” matter from.
It doesn’t matter one dump whether the
press is or is not admitted to the sittings of the
coming Federal Convention. Given reporters and
daily press reports —we should say, versions—of
the proceedings, every gasometer m the Conven-
tion would deem it his duty to supply the country
with murk on the question of Federation. On
the other hand, in a secret conclave the weak-
minded men would be hypnotised by the stronger-
Wl lled—or small cliques would be overmatched by
large cabals—and National Australia would run
the risk of being both botched and betrayed.
The sensible and safe course —whether the sittings
be private or public—is to swear in four or five
Parliamentary shorthand-writers, bind them by
oath to take verbatim reports of all the speeches,
and let their reports, unaltered, be published and
circulated, with an affidavit from the phono-
graphers that the same have not been tampered
with. However, the final result of the Conven-
tion will depend not so much on what is said in
formal conference as on what Parkes says to
Gillies and Gillies says to Parkes in the private
sitting-room at the hotel.
With the fullest knowledge of the dormant
demon they are rousing, the banded capitalists of
Australia are vindictively attempting to crush out
trades-unionism and to enslave labour. The
Pastoralists’ Association is only one feeler of the
great octopus, Capital. Behind the squatters
stand the shipowners, the Employers’ Association,
and millions of money. On the side of the
shearers are the pence of the people and hundreds
of thousands of the people themselves. _ Giddy
with the pride of recent victory, Capital is ruth-
lessly forcing the tight further, and selects the
shearers as a nomadic, .san.s-franchise, and pre-
sumably weak wing of the Labour Army. If we
can believe any official report of the pastoralists,
months of organising have enabled them to engage
a number of blacklegs—pirate shearers—with
whom, by timing localities with the varying
seasons, it is proposed to shear all the sheep on
the continent, from the Gulf of Carpen-
taria to that of St. Vincent. Ten thou-
sand unionist shearers in Queensland are
told that there is to be for them no bread-
winning unless they choose to bend the knee to
thesauatter. The old transparent fraud, “Law
and Order,” is again presented as a shield to cover
Capital’s tyranny. The squatters “have made
arrangements with the Queensland Government
to supply sufficient police protection for their free
labourers.” That is to say, the squatters have
hired mercenaries from the Government to shoot
down fellow-citizens robbed of their means of
living. In vain have the labour organisations
asked for “an open conference.” The squatters
proffer a false thing which they call a conference,
“ provided * freedom of contract ’ be recognised.”
“ Freedom of contract ” is the hall-mark of wage-
slavery. The new squatting agreement “seeks to
make labour submit to reductions of wages, in
some items the reduction being 83 percent.” The
squatters are distinctly on the war-path, and
brutally challenge the retaliation of the fire-stick,
of personal violence and bloodshed, hoping to
entrap the shearers into illegal mistakes. On the
other hand, the piracies and robberies of labour
by squatterdom are to be upheld by the batons
and revolvers of hireling mercenaries, chartered
from and liveried by the State.

SKETCHES FROM A LIFE OF ACTION.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
11.
When Governor Grey landed in Auckland
on 14th November, 1845, he found the whole of
the settlers in a state of consternation. The
country people, dreading a war of races, had
flown to the town as a place of refuge, though
with small reliance on its security, as the dreaded
Heke was expected to attack it shortly. Brito-
marte barracks were entrenched, two block houses
erected, Fort Ligar thrown up near the Roman
Catholic chapel, and the windows of St. Daubs
Church barricaded.
With disorganised finances, a bankrupt treasury,
and a defeated soldiery, the position looked
desperate.
The Governor took the field in person and
assumed the command of the forces, and within
two months of his arrival in New Zealand he had
brought the war to an end, retrieved the disasters
in the field, forced the enemy to sue for peace,
restored the credit of the colony, and placed its
finances on a proper footing.
* * *
But though Heke and the Northern
Maoris were pacified there were troubles ahead in
the Company's Settlement at Wellington likely to
be more formidable and more difficult to overcome
than the war in the North. The manner in which
Captain Grey out the Gordian knot and suddenly
stilled the ferment has been more persistently
misrepresented than any episode of his first
Governorship.
The warlike chiefs, Rangihaeata and Ra ipa-
raha, were bent on war, though the latter craftily
concealed his designs, and even declared his
intentions to be friendly.
Early in April, 1846, an old man named Gilles-
pie and his son were murdered by a Maori taua
(war party) at the Hutt, near Wellington. Rau
paraha indignantly denounced the deed, offered
to assist in capturing the murderers, and even
went on board H.M.S.S. Driver to see the
Governor, who had at once proceeded in the ship to
Porirua Harbour, close to the wily old chief’s
principal stronghold.
But Rauparaha had meanwhile taken care that
the culprits had got away into the interior.
Attacks continued to be made on settlers, ambus-
cades were laid by the Maoris, small parties of
soldiers were attacked and several killed in differ-
ent places, and the Governor soon became con-
vinced that Rangihaeta and Rauparaha were
acting in concert, but it was only when he had
received positive proof, of this secret understanding
that he determined on the bold stroke which
paralysed the enemy, and has since been adduced
against Sir George as an evidence of treachery and
bad faith.
The following is his account of the transaction :
Before daybreak on the morning of the 22nd
July, 1846, while he was in bed at Wellington, a
man rode up hastily to the house and, rousing the
porter, desired immediate audience of tire Gover-
nor on a matter of the most urgent importance.
Captain Grey at once got up and saw the man,
who proved to be a Wanganui settler with whom
he Was acquainted and could depend on. This
settler lived on very friendly terms with the
Maoris, and his tale was that on the night of the
19th, after being out cattle-hunting all day,
being benighted, he went to the whare <*f
a chief with whom he was acquainted, and lay
down for a sleep. That while there emissaries
from Rauparaha and Rangihaeata had come in
and invited the co-operation of the Wanganui
tribes in a combined attack on the Wellington
settlement. This was agreed on, and the march
was to take place on the following day. His pre-
sence was not perceived, or perhaps they thought
either that he did not understand what was going
on, or was asleep, as indeed he pretended to be.
He remained quietly on his mat all night, seemen
perfectly at ease in the morning, had a meal with
his hosts, and then mounting his horse rode in a
homeward direction to deceive them.
Then, getting another horse, he rode deliberately
towards the North as though still cattle-hunting,
but when quite out of sight turned and made for
Wellington, keeping well out of Maori tracks.
On hearing this alarming news, the Governor’s
mind was at once made up. He gave strict
directions to the household that the settler’s
arrival was to be kept quite secret, and the man
himself was requested to keep closely to his room
in the Governor’s house for a day or two.
Soldiers were drafted so quietly and in such small
detachments on board the Driver before daybreak
that no Maori, and not even a European settler,
had any idea of what was going on.
After breakfast Captain Grey, unaccompanied,
sauntered leisurely to the jetty, got into a boat,
and was pulled off to the war vessel, which steamed
slowly past Porirua to the northward, until out of
sight of the land.
During the night, however, the vessel was
turned back, and before daylight on the 23rd July,
the forces, 128 soldiers and 38 blue-jackets were
landed in the Driver’s boats at the foot of
Rauparaha’s pah.
The surprise was complete, the force over-
powering, but the old chief made a desperate
struggle to escape, and would not give in until
assured that no injury would be done to him.
He was then at once transferred to the
Driver and subsequently held as a State prisoner
on H.M.S. Calliope in Wellington.
There was some desultory fighting after this,
but it was spiritless, for the capture of their
greatest strategist was a blow from which the
Maoris did not recover for many years.
Had the combination of the tribes been effected,
there was no force in New Zealand then that
could have withstood them, and the Wellington
settlement would have been wiped out.
But this is how even the latest “ History of
New Zealand,” written by Mr. F. J. Moss, late
M.H.R., and now British Resident at Raro-
tonga, passes judgment on Governor Grey’s dash-
ing exploit: “This seizure on suspicion was one
of those deeds which may possibly be excused ’
as precautionary ; but such deeds undoubtedly
create suspicion, deepen mistrust, and often sow
the seeds of future mischief. That which is not
straightforward is seldom advantageous in the
end.”
# * *
The Governor had settled the Maori diffi-
culty, but he had now a more desperate war to
wage with the land-sharks, chief among whom
were the missionaries. What between their
Bible and jew’s-harp land-exploitations, and
illegal purchases of enormous blocks under the
penny-an-acre and ten-shilling-an-acre proclama-
tions of Governor Fitzroy, which had been issued
without due authority, all the good available
land existing within reasonable distance of
.Auckland had been bought by private persons
for next to nothing, and they were asking such
exorbitant prices for it that extension of settle-
ment —the great need of the colony became
impossible.
To give a few instances of missionary greed,
selected from many others, Rev. R. Taylor claimed
50,000 acres ; Rev. Henry Williams, 22,000 ; Mr.
George Clark, Church Missionary Agent, 10,000;
Mr. W. T. Fairburn, C.M.A., 20,000; Mr. James
Kemp, C.M.A., 18,552, etc., etc. The Rev.
Henry Williams, indeed, had very enlarged views
on missionary occupation of land, for in December,
1835, he forwarded “a deed of trust of land,
belonging to natives,” to Sir Richard Bourke
the Governor of New South Wales (New Zealand
was then an appanage of that colony), and to the
secretary of the Church Missionary Society in
London, with a request that the missionaries at
the Bay of Islands might be appointed trustees
for all the lands of hew Zealand, in order to
“preserve it from the intrigues of designing
men!”
As may be imagined, neither Governor Bourke
nor the secretary of the C.M.S. could be induced
to grant this modest request.
Under the* law of the colony, as it then stood,
no person could purchase land in excess of 2560
acres. It is generally stated that Sir George
Grey of his own motion proceeded to make void
all purchases exceeding this limit, but actually
he did nothing of the kind. He selected one
“THE ILLS THAT FLESH IS HEIR TO.”
CUSTOMER: “I say, George, what’s become of Fred, who used to wait at this table?
Haven’t seen him about lately.”
GEORGE: “Well, sir, he’s laid up, poor chap, with what they calls Haricot Veins!”
purchase as a test case and had it tried in the
Supreme Court. There it was hardly fought,
thoroughly argued out, and a very elaborate
judgment given against the grantees. The result
was the cancellation of the grants in cases where
they exceeded the limit allowed by law, the issue
of grants for 2256 acres only, and the accession of
much land in the neighbourhood of Auckland to
the Government, thus allowing room for the ex-
pansion of settlement.
But what a storm raged round the devoted
head of Captain Grey ! In a despatch to the
Secretary of State for the Colonies, on 20th June,
1846, he stated what he was about to do, and
added that a great outcry and much opposition
might be anticipated from the powerful interests
involved ; that all the legislative councillors,
Government officer’s, and missionaries would join
his opnonents; and that these were the classes
who urged that the natives should be allowed to
do what they liked with their land.
He was right, there was an outcry —a howl of
disappointed greed and sordid avarice.
But in this struggle the Governor had one firm
supporter, and he, though a churchman and a
bishop, one gs truly a man as the Governor him-
self, to wit, Bishop Selwyn, some of whose letters
on this and kindred subjects the missionary party
endeavour to keep wholly out of sight. They are
certainly never quoted nor referred to.
In 1843 Bishop Selwyn informed the Church
Missionary Society by letter that the land pur-
chases of the missionaries had “an injurious
effect upon the minds of the natives and the Eng-
lish settlers.”
In. 1847 the Bishop wrote to the clergy of his
diocese that the land purchases of the missionaries
had created jealousies, affected the character of
the society, and alienated Maori affections. “All
this,” he adds, “I will undertake to prove if it
should ever be necessary; but I earnestly desire
to be spared the painful duty by your quiet
acquiescence in the Governor’s proposal.”
But the Rev. Henry Williams refused to make
a quiet surrender of his land ; so the Church Mis-
sionary Society, for its own credit’s sake, com-
pelled to make an example, removed his name
from the list of their missionaries.
After a few years he was reinstated, at (this
circumstance, we believe, has never been made
public) the earnest entreaty of Sir George Grey.
# * *
Captain Grey’s next set-to was with the
wt / -i b iii is, i .
War Office, a dangerous opponent, but he fought
in a righteous cause, and m this in stance also
came out victor, though without beat of drums
for the defeat was silently accepted and never
openly acknowledged.
After the capture of Rauparaha and during
the final operations against Rangihaeata, nine
prisoners were brought in to Porirua by the troops.
They were immediately tried by court-martial;
one was declared insane, seven sentenced to be
transported to Van Dieuian’s Land, and the
ninth, a young chief Martin Luther Wareaita to
be hanged as a rebel for bearing arms against the
imperud forces, though there was not even a
suspicion of murder against him. The Governor
was in another part of the colony and heard

Captain Grey was very indignant, and denied
the right of execution under martial law while
competent courts of justice were in existence and
in full operation, and backed up Ins nrotest by a
vigorous desnatch to the Secret arv nf State

Shortly after, a party o Maoris murdered a

four children, as utu for a wound in the head of

the Governor wrote ordering that the mur
derers, who had at once been seized by the
natives themselves and handed over to Captain
Laye, the officer in command of the troops at
Wanganui, should be sent to Wellington for trial.
But Captain Laye had meanwhile convened a
court-martial and hanged four of the Maoris. The
'fifth being very young, and not considered
responsible, was sentenced to transportation to
Van Dieman s Land.
An animated corresnondence with the Home
authorities ensued. The Governor insisted on
the jurisdiction of the Civil powers, while the War
Office insisted on martial rights.
No direct satisfaction was ever afforded to Cap-
tain Grey in the matter, but on his return to
England he found that instructions had been
issued that in future all criminals taken by the
troops were to be handed over to the Civil power.
In this connection it may not be out of place to
give Sir George Grey’s views on the subject of
death-sentences. Asa general rule he is of
opinion that the worst use you can put a man to
is to hang him.
A few months back there was great excitement
over the death-sentence bejng passed on two mere
boys in England for the murder of their father, a
man who had brutally ill-treated his wife—their
mother.
Through an error in the cablegram, the New
Zealand papers stated that both lads had been
executed, and this was generally believed, though
one was respited at the last moment.
Sir George was much agitated when he read
the cablegram, and talking over the matter,
referred also to an execution of lads that had
taken place in N.S. Wales.
He declared that, so far from a beneficial result
having been obtained by holding executions in
private, the public sense had been deadened, and
people were no longer alive to the horror of what
took place, and the cruel abuse of the law which
might result. Public feeling was, in other
respects, now being educated to a better tone,
and though in past generations, when the public
mind was to a perhaps larger extent brutalised,
lads were often executed, such a thing could not
take place in public nowadays without exciting
a thrill of horror, that would sweep away all such
abominations.
“If,” said he, “an attempt had been made to
carry out the sentence on those boys in the full
light of day, I believe public feeling would have
been strong enough to prevent the executions.”
# * #
The next great exercise of the Governor’s
power for a time embroiled him with the whole
population, and he was widely reviled for what
was afterwards acknowledged to be the most
beneficial act of his career.
An Act was passed by the Imperial Parliament
in 184(3 granting a Constitution to New Zealand.
But the suggestors, and to some extent the authors,
of this Constitution were the wealthy squatters of
the colony and their powerful friends among the
English aristocracy. The suffrage granted was so
very limited that all power would fall into the
hands of the land-grabbers, and considering the
small number of Europeans and their great greed
for Maori lands, the Governor did not think it
safe to trust the destinies of the natives to the
settlers.
Captain Grey therefore declined to put the
Constitution in operation, and adduced such solid
reasons that the Home Government gave way and
suspended the charter for five years.
Popular indignation ran high throughout the
colony, meetings were held in all centres of popu-
lation, settlers’ constitutional associations sprang
up everywhere, petitions couched in the strongest
and most uncomplimentary terms were showered
on the Colonial Office and Parliament; and, from
one end of New Zealand to the other, the Gover-
nor was the most unpopular and best abused man
to be found in it.
Meanwhile, Captain Grey cared for none of these
things, but quietly drafted a Constitution on
lines he deemed best suited for a colony that
should in time become a democratic nation. It
was finally adopted after a few alterations which
were in no case improvements. But, notwith-
standing these amendments, when, in 1852, it
finally passed the Imperial Parliament, New Zea-
land possessed what was acknowledged to be the
most workable Constitution, as well as the most
bberal, possessed by any British colony at that
time.
# # #
, With the Canterbury Association there
was a revival of the fight against land monopoly.
There a high price was placed on land with the
avowed intention of preventing labourers from
becoming land-owners, and so keeping them in a
state of dependence and creating a pseudo-aris-
tocracy. Sir George Grey—for he had been
knighted in 1848—again entered the lists against
the squatters, and issued a proclamation reducing
the price of land in the provincial district, outside
the company’s first purchase, to 10s. an acre. He
also devised means for preventing the establish-
ment of a State Church, which was contemplated
by the company.
In the latter he was successful, but in the
former he was eventually defeated by an unholy
compact, or understanding, between the squatters
and the officials of the Band Office, and the inven-
tion of “ gridironing,” which his departure from
the colony soon after rendered him unable to
defeat.
* * *
Among other good services, the credit of
which have been denied to Sir George Grey, was
the establishment of the liberal constitution of the
Church of England, in New Zealand, making it
a free and independent body, with none of the
evils of state church ism.
This constitution is always attributed to Bishop
Selwyn, the Bishop’s denial notwithstanding.
In 1867, when on the point of leaving for Eng-
land, Bishop Selwyn delivered a farewell address
at Auckland in which occurred the following
passage:—
“ I would now say a few words with regard to
the Synod and the Constitution. The speakers
who have referred to that subject have mentioned
me as the originator of that Constitution. I have
now the pleasure of telling you that there was
something more touching in the origin of that
Constitution than most persons are aware of. The
first draft of the present Constitution was drawn
by Sir George Grey on a sick bed at Taranaki (in
1850), and it was the fruit of those feelings which
come upon the mind in sickness—-when a man sets
aside thoughts of Government and the cares of
this world, am and knows, as a Christian man, that
he has something better to think of than the
perishable things of this life.

Extracts from the diary of Jameson ; one
of Butcher and Bandit Stanley’s crowd :—
April 7th. — Marched to Vombo, quite the quickest
march we have done, owing to a good level road, and Mr.
Stanley doing rear-guard with some of his Somalis him-
self. How he did lay his stick about the lazy ones, and
the Somalis whacked away too. It was a sight for sore
eyes to see the lame, the sick, the halt, and the blind
running with their loads, as if they were feathers ; and I
was delighted to see some of my men catch it hot, after
1 had been told by Mr. Stanley himself not to strike them.
The march was otherwise uninteresting.

of cutting and loading, 2s. 6d. per ton ; lowest cost
of hauling to mill, 2s. 6d. per ton ; or 13s. per ton
delivered at mill. The lowest computation (ten
tons of cane to one ton of sugar) gives us £6 10s.
Prom the rollers, through clarifiers, subsiders,
triple-effect, vacuum pan, coolers, centrifugals,
drying and bagging ; with cost of lime, sulphur,
superphosphate, and bags another £6 10s. must be
added, giving a total of £13. It is the boast of a
now prominent Queensland M.L.A. that he can
produce a ton of sugar for £10; but the fact
remains that during several years of management
be never did so.—Yours truly, Sugar. Herbert

POLITICAL
POINTS
s rvvvvvvvv
Premier Munro, of Victoria, strongly
suspects Booth’s “Darkest England” scheme.
At the beginning of the century a million
yearly was added to the population of France.
Now the increase has sunk to 937,000.
Premier Griffith has taken a new departure
this year by enrolling a number of working men
on the Queensland list of Justices of the Peace.
The prospect of sharing in the proposed
titles should bring Sir Patrick Jennings back
from the Darling Downs to public life in N.S.W.
Says Gladstone, in allusion to Home
Rule :—“I have been rolling this stone up the hill
for five years, and now it has rolled down again,
and I am eighty-one.”
A German cobbler has been sentenced to
two months for /esc majeste because he refused to
rise when someone in a fcabaret shouted “hoch!”
for the Emperor with the sore ears.
Ex-Attorney General Wrixon will not
resign his seat at the Federal convention in favour
of present Attorney-General Shiels. You see,
this is Wrixon’s last chance for a title.
“ The young men,” said Squatter Abbott
in his evidence before the N.S.W. Labour Com-
mission, “ are unionists, while the old men are
not. ” The clock of the world moves on.
The good old 1.0. U. policy has now been
fairly initiated in West Australia. Premier
Forrest’s first loan is a modest one, and only
reaches a little more than a million and a third.
Champion compares the Australian strikers
to “an army of lions led by asses.” Better to be
misled by an honest ass than to be purposely de-
ceived by a designing fox of the Champion variety,
A certain N.S. Wales M.L.A. has sent a
bill in to Government at 3s. per head for the
board and lodging of the police troopers who
were provided for his protection during the recent
strike.
The N.S.W. Foreign-trade party up to
lately used to drag the Single-tax across the
trail of the fiscal issue. Now they try to divert
attention to Co-operation as the panacea for social
and commercial ills.
At the next general election in Queens-
land it is understood that MTlwraith, now repre-
senting North Brisbane with Premier Griffith,
who is thus his colleague in a twin sense, will
stand for the Burrum.
South Australia will shortly go to the
London market for another loan, this time for
£1,532,913. If this loan be floated, the S.A.
public debt will be £22,684,000, or over £7O per
head of the population.
Jack Gardiner, “ the football member ”
for Carlton (Melb.), considers that the Federation
of the English-speaking people of the world will
shortly be consummated. Which just about
decides the question in the negative.
Does anyone know the real reason why
Freetrade Secretary Pulsford resigned ? Wasn’t
it for the very same reason that Mr. Henry
Tennant Donaldson is now honorary secretary
to the political committee of the N.S.W.
National Club ?
Goschen put his finger on the blot, speak-
ing last week at Leeds. He complained of the
Australian tariffs as hostile to England, and
rightly argued that they proved the sympathy
with Britain to be very thin. In fact, we are
practically cut off already.
The British Crown is not entailed on the
Wettins. Even should “Tummy” live long
enough—that’s doubtful —the House of Commons
may refuse to uphold his claim. Now, we’ve lost
our J.P.-ship, we feel inclined to have a go for
the sceptre and shekels.
Gladstone tells Australian Labour Delegate
Fitzgerald that he does not believe in labour
legislation which, he says, tends to destroy
individualism among the workers. Gladstone,
like his great Australian prototype, Mr. E. W.
O’Sullivan, is not a socialist.
Ex-Premier Dibbs said in the presence of
Governor Jersey, the other day, that nothing
would come of Imperial Federation, but that
“ eventually Australia would become an Empire
in itself.” What does Dibbs mean ? Those who
mean Republic, say Republic.
“ When once Australian Federation is
completed,” says Lord Carington, “England will
have an easy task in influencing the Australian
national feeling in her favour.” Let this signifi-
cant but, perhaps, unintentional warning be not
neglected by Australian nationalists.
An agitation for the adoption of one
common military uniform throughout the Aus-
tralian defence forces is cropping up. Before
devoting so much attention to uniformity of cloth-
ing it would be as well for young Australia to seek
Uniformity of justice, social responsibilities, and
material comforts.
A threepenny journal, with death on its
little brow, has budded forth in a Sydney suburb
under the ambitious title of the Australian.
It’s a monthly, and so may not droop and die till
autumn. Its supplement is entitled The Aus-
tralian Federalist. Is this the journal so long
threatened by B. R. Wise?
Sir George Grey favours “ a loose kind of
federation” of the English-speaking peoples in
preference to a hard-and-fast business bargain.
The same sort of federation, in fact, which a
sensible man generally has with his mother-in-
law. Where interests are hopelessly diverse
federation cannot be too loose.
The Lang statue may help to start the
young Australian reading his book on Freedom
and Independence for Australia—with Lord
Jersey’s approbation. There has been a long line
of monarchs since Dr. Lang urged the Republic—
your Belmores, Loftuses, Caringtons, and what
not, all taking the same profound interest as Lord
Jersey.
“Nigger-sugar” Cowley, who, imme-
diately after delivering a passionately vindictive
attack on Griffith, then leader of the Queensland
Opposition, accepted a portfolio from that
potentate, has publicly explained that he “ came
down from the North an ardent Separationist,
and would go back an ardent Federationist.”
Same old “ thirty pieces of silver.”
The Maitland Mercury “fully believes
that the ranks of free-labeurers include some good
men in every respect. ’ The Bulletin doesn’t.
It believes that “free ' labourers are good men in
no respect whatever. The man who, for the sake
of a temporary easing of his own position, is
willing to betray his brethren into white slavery,
has plumbed about as deep an abyss of degrada-
tion as is possible to a creature walking upright
on two legs and possessing no tail.
RATHER DOUBTFUL.
MR. DESINGER: “Well, old fellow, what did you think of our concert —took well
didn’t it?”
MR. DECYNIC : “ Oh, yes, it was indeed a howling success.”
“ The M‘Kinley tariff has had the effect of
lowering wages in America, and the working men
are expected to protest against its continued
operation,” says the cableman. Now, this is and
must be a mere expression of opinion, but the
opinion is shamelessly put forward to poison the
Australian public mind in favour of the British
exporters. The M‘Kinley tariff will pull down
wages in Canada.
The S.A. Parliament passed an act last
session providing for a system of voting quite new
to Australia, voters who may be absent from
their district on the day of election can, under
the new system, vote through the post-office, the
vote being signed in the presence of the post-
master, on a form supplied by the returning-
officer. The system is to be tried shortly in the
bye-election for Wooroora.
Look, now that Bradlaugh is dead>
at the heroic fight made by him to assert
the right of unbelievers to sit in the Mouse
of Commons. It lasted five years, 1880 to
1885, but, alas ! it broke his health, and ruined
his pocket, so that not long Mck he declared he
would have to retire, solely from poverty—as
Burns has said he, too, must give in. The collapse
of the Opposition at last was absurd, but it did
not take place until men like Northcote and
Wolff had made their capital by trading on
bigotry. What a satire on “British fair play”
and the mutability of? human opinion is the fact
that the resolution deriving the right of Brad-
laugh, the atheist, to take the oath has now been
unanimously expunged from the records of the
Commons 1
Personal Items.
Hopetoun is a youth, but Jersey is a
Child. Next!
At latest, Parnell was living next door to
Mrs. O’Shea at Brighton.
Mrs. Morrissett, widow of the Norfolk
Island Commandant of the thirties, still lives at
North Sydney—a hale old lady.
Sir Thomas Elder, K.C.M.G., the South
Australian millionaire who prompts the latest ex-
ploring expedition, is a confirmed bachelor.
In G. B. Barton’s “Life of Wentworth”
we hope to see set at rest the much-vexed ques-
tion ; “Was Billy Wentworth cross-eyed?”
There is said to be a Chinese cook, named
Adam Macpherson, on a Queensland station, who
can give Quong Tart points at Caledonianism.
Hollis Hopkins, whom the cableman
frequently refers to as conferring with Knutsford
anent N.Q. separation, is a Townsville (Q.) linen-
draper.
The C.P.S. at Forbes, the Hon. Edmund
A. T. Pery, J.P., is, since the resignation of Sir
John Read, Bart., the only titled N.S.W. Civil
servant. .
The German Emperor finished his 32nd
year last week. Nothing happens but the unfore-
seen—he has not chimed in with any stamp of
prophet.
If it be true that General Booth presented
his daughter with a £5OOO cheque on her wedding-
day, the old man must be doing very well out of
the business.
The fire-eating Brigadier-General M‘lver
has gone home and partaken of the fatted-calf at
the fair hands of his wife, from whom he had
been separated for some years.
In the Review of Reviews Stead prints
as a frontispiece his own portrait: “The Editor
at _ his desk.” Modesty and “social purity”
evidently are convertible terms.
Sir Alfred Stephen, N.S.W. ex-Chief Jus-
tice, receives a pension of £lB2O per annum, while
Sir William Manning, an ex-Puisne Judge, man-
ages to get £2620 per annum as pension.
One of the striking characteristics of recent
“ opening”-speeches by Cardinal Moran is a weak
attempt at “tact.” Witness his gushing references
to Governor Jarsey and Sir Henry Parkes.
The Boomerang calls Parkes the “H.0.M.”
Does this mean “ Honest Old Man,” or only
“Hairy Old Man?” Or is it a sly dig at his
passion for passing as the “ Haitch Omitting
Man ? ”
Mr. J. J. Lee, chief clerk in charge of the
criminal branch of the N.S.W. Crown Solicitor’s
Office, was first appointed on 15th February, 1845.
His service has been continuous ever since, making
a term of 45 years.
The oldest English clergyman is aged one
hundred, viz.. Rev. Mr. Elliot, of a parish called
Randwick, which he has stuck to. in nernetual
curacy ever since the year before Queen Victoria
was born —73 years.
Sydney has now six statues in the open :
Two—husband and wife —to Royalty; one to
science and intrepidity—Cook; one to a dead
Governor—Bourke; one to Republican Lang ; and
one to “ Morality ” Mort.
Two Dromios, or two Antipholi—Gov.
Jarsey and Railway Minister Shiels, of Melbourne;
only one of them is ever so much handsomer
than the other. The handsomer is, of course, the
man who has the bluer blood.
Saturday Review, last file, says “Robbery
under Arms ” is the best Australian work yet ;
but many will still swear by “His Natural Life,”
in which Clarke went one better than his great
admiration, “ Geoffry Hamlyn.”
Lord Onslow, Vice-Gracious of New Zea-
land, is bilious over the prophetic vision that “in
the coming by-and-byo, the world will cease to be
able to support its increasing population.” Yes—
of titled idlers and gilded loafers.
The late Robert Bennett did not follow
the example of his predecessors and successors in
the Melbourne mayoral chair, and give his oil-
portrait to the collection in the Town Hall. He
always said he could not afford it.
Minister of Education Bews (S.A.) says
he was never so happy in all his life as when he
was a lad and herded pigs at half-a-crown a week.
De gustibus non est disputandum. What a noble
ambition to put before schoolboys !
Rev. George Walters, of Sydney, says
that he once tried to deliver an amusing address,
but “nobody laughed,” and adds: “How I
escaped a lunatic asylum is still a mystery to me. ”
How all the humorless parsons escape the lunatic
asylums is a mystery to us.
Premier Griffith, of Queensland, during
his recent visit to Charters Towers, grievously
hurt the feelings of a lot of people by his indul-
gence in a “morning dip.” The opinion of Char-
ters Towers now is that “Sam is too oarmine
clean to be a real demmycrat.”
Mr. George Walton, the gifted young
English artist, whose portrait, “My Mother,”
will long be remembered by those who saw it at
Sydney Art Society’s exhibition, is dead—of con-
sumption. During his stay in Australia Mr.
Walton resided chiefly in Melbourne.
Good old Dr. Singleton, of Melbourne, has
retired for ever from his philanthropic work—one
of the true salt of the earth. For sixty years he
has walked about in a shabby coat visiting the
sick, feeding the hungry, consoling the afflicted—
and being imposed upon by the loafers.
Rudyard Kipling’s phenomenal success—■
based, be it said, on a fine imagination and a
unique power of laying on three colours in three
words—is making any number of literary enemies
for that young Anglo-Indian. We find the envious
Sims clumsily scoffing at a recent story by “ Back-
yard Tippling.” s
E. N. Newbury, the S.A. official who
vanished at the same time as his cash, preached—
a fortnight before his little trouble —in a suburban
Anglican Church. Whittington, a leading audit
official and the man who discovered the deficiency,
is a leading light in the congregation, and was one
of the worshippers.
Bishop Julius, of Christchurch, Maori -
land, has shocked some of his congregation. He
was proceeding to the cathedral on a Sunday
morning with a sermon in his pocket, when he
found himself -behind time. There was no cab in
sight, but a friendly fish-cart being at hand, the
Bishop jumped in and was in his pulpit “on
time.”
His Honor District Court Judge Wilkin-
son has entered into an arrangement with the
Queensland Government for an edition of his
excellent “Australian Magistrate.” The reward
is a very considerable sum, and the work engages
the Judge’s leisure and vacation. Verily, no man
is a prophet in his own province, though he may
be deemed a legal authority in a neighbouring
one.
The pleasantly-remembered Mr. James
Sheen Dowling (ex-District Court Judge, and
sometime N.S.W. Attorney-General) is about to
give to the world “ The Note-book of an Austra-
lian Judge.” The volume will be issued from the
Sydney press. If the ex-Judge will only tell the
beat stories about that other Judge who used to
play II Penseroso to his L’Allegro, the book
should be very amusing indeed.
Alfred Cellier, the composer, who returned
to Australia by the Oroya, looks extremely ill, we
are soi'ry to say. He cherishes fond memories of
curry partaken of at Colombo, and intends return-
ing by that route, so as to again delight his palate.
Alfred kept the Adelaide reporters —always
hungry themselves —for nearly a quarter of an
hour telling them about the curry, until they
became exasperated. Cellier leaves Australia next
May.
We notice that Mr. G. H. Supple, the
journalist, sentenced to death in Melbourne 20
years ago for shooting Walsh in his effort to shoot
G. P. Smith, is working in New Zealand. He
made a mark in literature as far back as_ 1856,
with a book on the Anglo-Norman Invasion of
Ireland, praised in warm terms by the London
literary papers. Barrister Fisher suggested the
•mint on which Chief-Justice Higinbotham let
him off.
When Miss Hannah de Rothschild was
married to Lord Rosebery, the whole of her dot,
one million sterling, was settled on the Earl, and
on the deatli of the Baroness Meyer de Roths-
child, Lady Rosebery’s mother, the entire pro-
perty in England of her late father passed into
her possession, and from hers into that of Lord
Rosebery, who does not possess the power, if he
wished to exercise it, of willing it away from the
children of his marriage. The amount of money,
stocks, and other negotiable securities which fell
to the share of Lady Rosebery was about
£4,000,000 sterling, and this was exclusive of real
property, pictures, plate, &c. Lord Rosebery
holds all this for life only.

Society
Among those who attended ex-Governor
Carington’s London lecture was James R. Fairfax,
of the S.M. Herald. James Fairfax must have
a nickel-steel cheek. He ought to have buried
himself in a cellar upon such an occasion. It was
his cold-blooded and cowardly paper which, after
justifying the brutal and unmanly action of the
law in regard to the Mount Rennie boys, turned
round on the morning upon which they were, as
it well knew, to be ruthlessly slaughtered, and
said that they had not had a fair trial. Anyone
who doubts this statement can easily verify it by
reading the leading article in the S.M. Herald of
7th January four years ago.
* # &
Governor Jersey should make himself
fully acquainted with the Mount Rennie affair, so
that he may on all occasions know what to do
with the prerogative of his royal mistress. Any
curiosity which Lord Jersey may already feel in
the matter should be stimulated by the tact that
he last week visited Darlinghurst Gaol and stood
upon the very gallows whereon the reputation of
Baron Carington as a man of discernment and a
lover of equal justice to all citizens was hanged
by the neck until it was dead.
* * *
The Baron, after diagnosing the Austra-
lian body politic for five years, has written a
prescription. It consists of but one word —Titles.
Bebauble the governing classes in effect, says
Carington, and they will keep the voters in order.
Carington knows that the lion in the path of the
Australian democracy is a lioness. The Austra-
lian politician who could, if left to himself, resist
the offer of a title is unable to resist the impor-
tunities of his wife, who always wants to be a
Lady and splash mud with her carriage-wheels
into the face of those cats her female enemies.
The Bulletin knows one man, who under pressure
from his wife abandoned thousands of pounds
annual income in order that she might be “ My
Lady.” The retention of the present system of
conferring Imperial titles, which system is
gradually but surely extending in the hereditary
direction (Clarke and Cooper to wit) means tho
perpetuation of a poisonous corruption. Not
even the existence of Lady , with her big
crop of illegitimate brats, can assuage the Aus-
tralian feminine thirst for ennoblement.
# # #
Baron Carington’s lecture last week serves
to remind us that Wentworth had some mis-
chievous ideas—one, that there ought to be an
Australian peerage. And with such a bauble
dangling, before his deluded fancy, he refused a
baronetcy.
# * *
Carington advises the institution of purely
colonial orders of knighthood, &c. But that
would not do the trick. Nothing is yet fashion-
able here which has not been imported from
abroad. The Australian woman with social and
knightly aspirations does not live in Australia.
She lives in the green fields far off—among the
dukes and nobles of Hingland, and the gilded
villains of the London Journal.
* * *
There is more humour in Jersey than you
might think, if you only judge him by looking at
him. He opened a church-bazaar at Goulburn
the other day, and in the course of his speech
said : —“lt gives pleasure at all times, and I think
it would to any of us, to assist in any good Chris-
tian work. ” Song-and-dance—hoo :
The recent Carington ought to read
yet another paper on “ Australia as I saw
it.” The chief heads of the discourse to
be a certain large and successful massacre; a
burnt-down drapery warehouse —the one whose
proprietor Carington sympathised with; the
awful language used by that cabman whom
Carington found cursing at his fare by
night on the memorable occasion when he paid
the shilling; the bashed-up footballer whom he
carted home in his barouche; the great episode at
Bourke when the beloved Gov. took truck-shunt-
ing exercise; the woman who invited him to
attend a wedding breakfast in a baby-linen shop;
the awful, beastly way the locusts flew into his
mouth and silted him up every time he yawned •
and one or two minor items.
* * *
After reading the address of welcome pre-
sented to Governor Jersey by the members of the
Goulburn (N.S.W.) Presbytery, we are of opinion
that the Presbytery, when composing it, were not
quite sure whether they were addressing Lord
Jersey or the Lord Almighty.
* # *
The Bulletin regards “pink-eye” as a
graceful compliment to Earl Jersey. Its advent
was simultaneous with that of His Excellency,
who, had we been a heathenish and superstitious
people, would have been slain at once on the
evidence against him.
* * *
The Wilson murder case has set talking
the Melbourne gossips, the lower-middle, old and
young tabbies, more than anything that has hap-
pened for a long time. Melbourne has had three
murders in a week, and all by amateurs. Wilson,
a tram-conductor, slaughtered his sweetheart like
a sheep, with a razor, in Darling Gardens, Colling-
woqd, on Sunday night, at half-past eleven, while
sitting on a gas-pipe. There had been mischief-
making, her wise women friends persuading her to
take a decorator, with twice the wages of the
tram-conductor. She loved the assassin, but liked
the decorator’s money. The mischievous bour-
geois idea as to Work being Disgraceful is at the
basis of nearly all —Respectability.
* * *
“Stella Marks had several times asked the
advice of lady friends as to what she ought to do,
stating that she loved Johnny Wilson (her
affianced husband) but * liked M‘Ewan because he
THEY WERE AFRAID.
MOTHER-IN-LAW : “In Queensland the blacks that came near us were all afraid of me.”
SON-IN-LAW : “Of course they were, why should they make an exception?”
had a better salary.' Her friends advised her not
to ‘ carry on ’ with both men. But she did.” The
only authenticated instance of a girl who didn’t
carry on—in a more or less harmless way as
regards the “other” —with two fellows at once
was Eve. Even she entered into a sort of flirta-
tion with the Serpent, the only living thing
beside Adam that could talk. And there was no
question of salary in that case :
The following from the Australian Star
(Sydney) is too rich to need comment: —
THE MURDER WAVE
BLOODSHED IN VICTORIA.
THE SWOOP OF THE TOMAHAWK AND THE BASH OF THE
BLUDGEON—POISON MIXTURES AND PISTOL SHOTS—THE
FLASH OP THE RAZOR—JEALOUSY AND SLAUGHTER —
THE LOVER’S CURE —A GRIM RECORD.
(FROM OUR MELBOURNE REPRESENTATIVE.)
There is a boom in bloodshed in Victoria, and the citizen
and bushman are simultaneously shivering in their shoes,
and keeping their eyes open for the destructive assassin.
A wave of death by violence is spreading over the land,
and the police are powerless to break its flow. People
hitherto regarded as innocent and law-abiding citizens
have called in the assistance of the tomahawk, the razor,
the pistol, the poison cup and the bludgeon to slay their
fellows. It is a sad and terrible condition of society, and
the possibilities are that it will become worse by-and-bye.
This is a horrible subject to deal with, but the duty must
not be shirked.

A young and sprightly Victorian widow
of some twenty-five summers, left by her first
husband with a fortune of some thousands a year,
was not long in forgetting her bereavement and
seeking the protection of a second swain. She
first engaged herself to a certain middle-aged
gallant naval captain, but soon transferred her
affections to a young scion of a well-respected
Australian family, holding a minor N.S.W.
Civil Service positon. 22nd January was fixed for
the nuptials, the reverend pastor of the fashionable
fane of St. John’s, Darlinghurst, was brought
from the Blue Mountains to perform the ceremony,
and a sumptuous breakfast was laid in a marquee
on the lawn of a friend of both parties. St. John's
was beautifully decorated, and no expense
was spared to make the event unusually
rekerky. The church was filled to overflowing
with the beauty and fashion of Darlinghust to
witness the event; but after waiting for over an
hour, neither bride nor bridegroom put in an
appearance. Some said the bride had eloped with
her first lover; some said the bridegroom had a
big head on him after the dinner at which he had
taken leave of bachelorhood on the previous
evening. However, in the end it turned out that
at the dinner aforesaid the bridegroom had
divulged, in a moment of extreme joyfulness,
that he was already married to the lady, and that
the honeymoon was over; however, he didn’t
mind having a second. Hence the confusion that
reigned at Darlinghurst on the following day.
Thus happily ended the practical joke into which
the young couple had drifted by reason of their
unwillingness to disclose their private marriage.
They journeyed overland to Adelaide, and left
for England by the Carthage.

Wagga must be a nice place to live in,
especially for “young gentlewomen.” From last
Saturday’s Sydney Daily Telegraph :

“ Young gentlewomen ” must be at a heavy dis-
count in N.S. Wales when they are expected to
rush a billet of nursery-maid and nursery gover-

thrown in as dressmaker and private secretary to
the “lady ”of the house, and pianoforte accom-
panist to some screaming member of the family,
for the munificent emolument of 7s. B|d., plus bed

monial. Another:—
Wanted, a constant friend by widow lady, aged 30, in

Open three days. Mrs. B , G.P.O.
The lonely widow may rest assured that she will

Here are some nice facts concerning a
well-known official who presides over an Aus-
tralian Court. His Honor is up to his eyes in
debt, and his dishonoured paper is as common in
loan-offices and solicitors’ hands as are flowers in
spring. It is no uncommon circumstance for him
to be “bailed up” in the street on his way to
Court by mondaines and toughs—in whose power
he is alleged to be —and made to empty out his
pockets; and it is further stated that persons,
with whom his Honor has had pecuniary trans-
actions, have a penchant for bringing cases in
his Court.

The cableman told us (and the newspapers
still tell us) that Boehm, the sculptor, was found
dead in his studio by Princess Louise—who, on
entering unannounced, was shocked to find him
prone on the floor. As a matter of fact, the
curiously Bohemian Princess had been in the
studio conversing with the artist, who is said
to have entered an ante-chamber, and while there
the Princess heard a noise, and, on entering,
found Sir Edgar dead. Yet there was no inquest.
The case prima jacie recalls that of Jimmy Morri-
son, the dapper Melbourne attorney, who was
found dead in his office by a lady friend of his. In
that case, however, there was an inquest, as
Morrison’s friend was a governess, not a Princess.

Three thousand Premier Permanent share-

because Liquidator Templeton has notified that
Yes, I’m Jarsey on the travel,
For I never duties shirk,
And my meek heart cannot cavil
Or at Christian or at Turk ;
Still I’ll own to, on this gravel,
Predilection for the Kirk ;
And, with parsons on the snavel—
It’s a good old Christian work.
For the gambler there’s the “ scaffle,”
For his ways are ways of murk ;
Try the curb, when fails the snaffle,
Much of wickedness we burke,
Though we cannot hope to baffle
All the betting-men who lurk;
But when parsons run a raffle —
It’s a good old Christian work.
HIS SALARY WAS BETTER.
Poor Stella Marks is dead and gone,
Yes, gone away to Glory,
And in a melancholy tone
We sing her cruel story :
She was engaged to one who talked
Of forging Hymen’s fetter,
Yet with another out she walked—
His salary was better.
She dearly loved her proper swain,
’Twas joy to have him hug her,
But still she could not quite refrain
From thinking of thfe “shugger”;
E’en as she sat on Johnny’s lap,
The while he used to pet her,
She’d not forget that other chap
Whose salary was better.
Each time her sweetheart raised a row
His jealousy she’d stifle,
And bid him not to trouble now
About a foolish trifle ;
She’d see the “ other ” nevermore—
But shortly Johnny met her
A-strolling with his rival, for
His salary was better.
Then, almost daft with jealous rage,
Did Johnny seek his Stella —
Just like that darkie on the stage
Whom dudelings call Othellab.
He loved her so—half-crazy lad !
He felt he could have c[n)t her —
She never would have fooled him had
His salary been better.
And Johnny begged her to explain,
We fear she couldn’t do it:
He took her by the throat, ’tis plain,
And put a razor through it.
The hot blood spurted from the gash,
She spoke no word or letter,
But died. Why did she want a mash
Whose salary was better ?
Then Johnny went to the perleece;
Those active men and zealous
Arrested him, and he’s at peace—
At least he isn’t jealous ;
He mourns the pretty damsel dead,
For how can he forget her ?
The rival suitor’s eyes are red
Whose salary was better.
Poor Stella Marks ! Poor Stella Marks !
She’s gone away to Glory :
An end has come to all her larks,
A sudden end and gory.
Before all girls, to give them pause,
For warning we must set her—
Don’t have a “ second string ” because
His salary is better.

for his conduct in seeking to smell nice on easy
terms; —
Any small amount of decency which
European royalty ever possessed seems to have
evaporated a good while ago. The last shred of it
vanished when that princely Italian, the Duke of
Aosta —the same spavined, scrofulous, morally-
busted potentate who was made King of Spain,
only to be thrown out by his disgusted subjects—
married his own niece with the sanction of the
Holy Church, and the imperial blessing of all
Europe. And now that Aosta has crumbled away,
md his desperately ugly bald head has been
bidden in the sepulchre of his fathers, the widowed
duchess proposes to marry the new duke, who
was first her cousin, and then her son by marriage,
Mid who is now to finish up by being her husband.
And then most likely she will die, and her second
ausband will run a harem of aunts and mothers-
m-law, or else he will elope with his grandmother
mder a special dispensation. The character of
Jleopatra begins to look up again in these days.
She only married her brother after all.

That “ enterprising Sydney coachman” who
colted a few weeks ago with his employer’s
daughter and heiress has not yet been heard of—
aor, for that matter, has the heiress. Incidents
of this sort are not very common in Australia as
yet, for the custom of hiring a garish menial with
portentous legs, and dressing him up in livery has
aot taken deep root in this country; but as the
gorged hanger-on increases and multiplies his
fiabit of borrowing the boss’s offspring will become
more and more marked. In America the custom
of eloping with the coachman is fixed and incur-
able, and even if that illiterate flunkey is an
blderly, ugly nigger it makes no difference;
practically it is the livery and not the live meat
he-slavey inside it that the girl falls in love with,
and if he were a Chinaman or a naval officer with
one leg he would probably get there all the same-
provided he had the clothes on. What ultimately
becomes of the girl and the gilded helot in such
cases is uncertain. Sometimes, if she is unusually
fortunate, her father may come after her and
pound her husband into a state of insensibility,
and kick him into next week, and then take her
back and keep her locked up on short rations q but
as a rule she is left to discover that he isn’t the
ethereal flunkey she took him for, and after that
she probably makes a precarious living for the
rest of her days in the washing industry. Any
man who insists on keeping a large, servile animal
in green clothes about the place has to take his
chance of finding his female descendant missing
some morning. The flunkey’s two chances in life
are to elope with an heiress or to start a public-
house, and naturally he slopes with the heiress
when he gets the show.

Dear Bulletin,— Chinese cooks really are
the mouth-artists that you represent them to be.
I remember, years ago, in Melbourne, a Chinese
cook had a remarkable fame for the artistic man-
ner in wh'ch he used to serve up “ thin bread and
butter” with the ladies’ afternoon tea. The
butter was spread as smooth as a “ glassy sea,
and quite “fetched” the feminines and their
attendant dudes. One afternoon, when tea was
poured out, the bread and butter was’nt up to
time. Mine host himself went down to hurry up
Chow Wong. He found the latter standing in a
pensive attitude in front of the kitchen-range
with puffed-out cheeks, while on the table near
him were thin “ rounds ” of bread placed in single
fi'e, ready, apparently, for being buttered. Mine
Host stormed and raved at Chow Wong, but the
latter merely shook his head and rolled his eyes
in agony, while his mouth worked convulsively
with a sort of centrifugal wobble. Mine Host,
after several blasphemies, fell upon the heathen
with a kick- in the stern and an objurgation, when
—a jet of molten butter spirted promiscuously
over everything, and Chow Wong calmly replied :
“What foh? You spoilee buttee. _ ioo cold
to-day, buttee no spleadee. Lose time now ;
begin all oveh again.” — Yours, &0., Ihe Dipso-
maniac.

A lady correspondent of the Pictorial
World enquires why women are less courageous

is very little difference between the sexes in that

“Woman simulates designedly more fear than
she actually experiences ; man studiously conceals
a deal of that fear wherewith he is more or less

According to evidence adduced at a

been in the habit of torturing his wife by all
styles of complicated ingenuity, from the common
“ knock-down blow ” to small doses of poison. He
rather fancied “tying her hands behind her back
and hanging her up by the feet for two hours.”
Another pastime was to force her down on her
back on a table and pretend to “screw her arms
out.” His wife was found dead on November 20
last with “ a graze on the nose and a black mark
across the throat.” Her loving husband has been
requested to give the usual official explanation.

The chief officers of the Sydney Board of
Health are understood to assert that if the Black
Death plague of the Middle Ages can possibly be
resuscitated by brutal filth, it will certainly re-
appear in Sydney. They tell ghastly stories of
sewage percolating through the kitchen floors of
small hotels, and of ordure bubbling into the baths
at the said fashionable hotels while lady-guests
are bathing. They go on to assert that the
plumbing-work necessary to place already-in-
spected premises in sanitary condition will cost
(or would, for the landlords, you may be sure, will
find a means of evading such absurd expense) a
million sterling. Meanwhile, Inspector Seymour
is having people fined heavily for offences against
the public health which display more grotesque
uncleanliness than could be conjured up by the
imagination of the champion dirty man.

In Victoria the proportion of decrees nisi to
marriages celebrated is one-third per cent., and the
petitions for divorce half per cent., which means
that two out of every three applications prove

there is one divorce to every 77 marriages, and in
San Francisco one to every six ! Divorce is on
the increase throughout all civilised nations.

G. R Sims maintains that “kindness to
animals is in no way a sign of kindness to human
beings, or of natural goodness of disposition ”—a
theory also favoured by Wilkie Collins in his
creation of Count Fosco. But no writer seems to
have specially noted the indifference, if not dis-
like, to dumb animals that is invariably shown
by the “model housewife” type of female. She
looks askance at dogs, cats, or even pet birds, and
takes no personal interest in a horse unless it be
pulling her along. Then she is either fearful lest
the beast may bolt, or vexed with it for not
travelling faster. A particularly virtuous and
energetic matron has, moreover, a hearty con-
tempt for hen fowls, and cries aloud for their
assassination (to be followed by household con-
sumption) directly they go off the lay. She is
much more charitably disposed towards the old
rooster. Every woman is at heart a rake.

£l5 15s. for counsel and £lO 10s. for the attorney.
The amount applied for was 150 guineas for
counsel and 75 for the attorney ! The Bulletin
ventures to urge that, considering the amount of
the retainer which would have to be paid to a
senior counsel in the ordinary way, Mr. Simpson
might venture to stretch the Crown allowance a
little. If he did, nobody could fairly growl.

MARTYRS TO THEIR LIVERS.
Of the ills weak flesh is heir to
(As the medicos will swear to)
There is nothing so distracting
As a liver seldom acting ;
Let your home be ne’er so snuggish,
If that vital organ’s sluggish,
Why, you never can look cheerful
And your temper’s something fearful ;
You sit and eat your dinner
Like a miserable sinner,
Whilst the echo of your grumble
Is a deep eternal rumble,
And at intervals you shiver—
Wretched martyr to your liver!
’Tis the liver’s at the bottom
Of the horrors, when you’ve “ got ’em ; ”
If your spirits are affected,
And your countenance dejected,
’Tis the liver, never doubt it —
Yet one cannot do without it.
Should it happen to be active
Life is pleasant and attractive;
But, alas ! and lack-a-daisy !
When it drives a fellow crazy,
Thus impelling him to slaughter,
Or to jumping in the water.
All the corpses in our rivers
Have been martyrs to their livers.
Some men are to be pitied
When a crime they have committed ;
You can take your oath a gent, is
What we call non compos mentis
When there’s evidence revealing
That he has a turn for stealing.
Quite insane is his condition
If he fill a good position—
Though the Law will pass a curse on
Any seedy guilty person,
For opinion is emphatic
That such cannot be lunatic.
Thus a doctrine has arisen
Guarding wealthy folks from prison,
And our sympathy increases
For the holders of the “ pieces ”
When a well-connected Tottie
Does a swindle, she is “dotty,”
And the judges cry “ Forgive her—
Bretty martyr to her liver ! ”
With shirt-fronts hand-painted
We’re not yet acquainted,
But when they come quite into fashion
We shall spot at a glance,
At a dinner or dance,
Each gent’s own particular passion.
The fellow who hunts
Has dogs on his fronts,
And foxes and fences and ’osses ;
The parson who prays
Invites us to gaze
On miniature Heavens and Crosses,
The crank after cricket
Will show us a wicket.
Bat, ball, and a portrait of Giffen ;
Whilst the bookmaker tricky
Has “mugs” on his “dickey,”
Investing their “stuff ” on a “stiff-’un.”
The self-seeking mayor
A picture will wear
Of a knight by chain armour encumbered ;
And (some people assert)
On the land-boomer’s shirt
Will be “lots,” nicely coloured and numbered.
A youth who is tender
On one of the gender
That makes married-man such a martyr,
Will soon be beginnin’
To paint on his linen
The face of his inamorata.
But thousands of sinners,
At dances or dinners,
Who’ve pluck to put boldly before us
The things they love best,
Will display on the breast
A vision of legs—in the chorus.

The Referee.
.fohn Roberts recently scored 1100 points in six
consecutive breaks—spot barred, of course. If the
ordinary amateur, who “ fancies his game a little,” will
consider how many times he usually picks up his cue
in the course of playing a 50, and if he will consider that
an abnormal fear of “leaving anything on” would cause
the said number of times to he much greater than usual,
he can possibly form some faint idea of the start that
Roberts could comfortably give him in, say, a game of
2000 up. Take big George Bonnor as a representative
amateur, able to score with what looks like great
rapidity against an inferior opponent. Now, Roberts
would be able and very willing to give Bonnor 1845 out of
2000 points. And Bonnor, for his part, could give about
1400 in 2000 to heaps of “ decent ” players, so-called.

An “open-air service” is held near the big
gymnasium at Darlinghurst, over which Larry Foley
presides. One evening an evangelist was telling the
crowd about “ turning the other side ” when a foe smites
you on the cheek. “ Wot rot!” said the practical Larry,
“ why, you’d be giving him the point of the jaw, and he’d
lay you out stiff with a Dennyhayser !”

“Honest” John Phelps, who in days gone by
used to act as judge for the Oxford and Cambridge boat-
races, has pegged out at the age of 86. Phelps was only
once called upon to use his intelligence at the winning-
post, and that was in the celebrated year of the “ dead-
heat,” when Oxford palpably won. The story went that
the old man gave his first decision as “ a dead-heat by
two yards,” afterwards sticking to the first part of the
verdict when its original stupidity was pointed out to
him. That was the last appearance of Honest John in
this important capacity.

A Voice; “Dear Bulletin, —About the Ger-
man clerks who are beginning to swarm also in Austra-
lian mercantile houses. One advantage they have is an
indifference to cricket and football, not regarding play-
games as the be-all and end-all of existence. Whatever
good is a young fellow in business if his head’s full of
football and cricket, while he is cockered up on Saturday
afternoons into thinking himself something big, as a
centre of barrackers, and all the business day there are
chums dropping in on important fixtures, and other
sporting affairs.”

Griffo’s head is getting decidedly swollen. He
gave a handsome girl, big enough to make four pugs, of

champion.”

Coburn, the Irish-Yankee fighter, died the

with Mace, and, on another occasion, fighting a draw with
Jem in a Missouri swamp after 3( hours in the ring. It
was said at the time that Mace didn’t want to win,- now it
is said he daren’t. Harry Poulson, a different sort of
pippin, is also dead. He nearly beat Tom Sayers in ’56,
when they fought for 3hrs. Bmins. for a £IOO stake.

The Sydney yacht Volunteer proved a veritable

the SaO, the lolanthe, the Arrow and the Tritonia. It is
a pity that so successful a yacht, and so plucky a sports-

neighbouring waters. Her latest performance was up to
championship form without doubt.

At West Maitland races on Saturday last, the
Free Handicap had to be struggled for three times before
a final decision could be given. Alter Petrel had run
home first a protest was laid, on the ground that the
start took place in front of the post, and the objection
being upheld, the horses'were ordered out again. Then
Cupid won, hut another protest proved fatal to him, and
the lot were sent on their third journey. This time
Petrel won again, and well earned the prize.

Beyond a doubt Kingsmill, the Queensland

I This he proved by the way he lately put down Joe Price

Gough made a fatal mistake by keeping Vespasia
| so far back in the Rosehill Handicap. The pace for the
first six furlongs was miserably slow, and he had no show
of giving Repose a 15-lengths start down the straight.
One of the finest-looking two-year olds of the
| season, Stromboli, full brother to Volcano, made his
| appearance in the Nursery Handicap at Rosehill on
j Saturday last. , He started favourite and should have
) won, but Huxley brought him altogether too late, and
i running a bit green he was beaten by a short neck.
# * #
Victor Hugo ran a great horse with 9st 51b in
the Clyde Handicap. Williams brought him with a good
run, but he shirked it the least bit at the finish, and
suffered defeat by the shortest of heads from Cobar. The
finish was very close ; indeed, a good many, especially the
backers of Hugo, said he had won. In Mr. Olliffe,
however, we have a square judge, and as he was in the
only position to judge with certainty, there cannot be
much doubt on the subject.

Bushman has at last won a race on N.S. Wales

The Superior of the Passionist Fathers
is now on a visit to Australia. From what we

It is nearly four years since Mr. C. F.
Stratton threw open to public use the inode!
hotel, built, owned, and occupied by him at
Waverley, Syd., and to-day what was then deemed
a doubtful experiment stands crowned with
triumphant success, lor the house is not only well
patronised by the local residents and visitors from
abroad, but has been made a home by commercial
people, and those retired from business who prefer
the fresh air, fine view, open expanse, quiet and
cool salubrity of Waverley to the heat, noise and
bustle of the great city, of which, however, they
are within easy distance by ’bus, tram or cab.
This handsome and commodious building, which
cost nearly £10,000, is situated at the corner of
Nelson and Cowper Streets, Waverley, and looks,
uninterruptedly, on the vast expanse of the Cen-
tennial Park, a reservoir of ozone and a heritage
of future joy to the people of N.S. Wales, and is
an architecturally handsome and undeniably com-
fortable and commodious building, with verandahs
back and front; it is of four stories, inclusive of the
basement, in height. On the first floor are situate
the public and private bar-rooms, both finished in
Huon pine and cedar, the former arranged in the
London style with sit-down stalls, swinging
doors, &e., and the latter _most elegantly
appointed ; the dining-room of 35 by 22 feet, and
the billiard-room well ventilated and cosy (40 by
32 feet, containing two of Halbert’s best tables)
and numerous parlours. On the second story may
be found the public drawing-rooms and a number
of single and double bedrooms furnished through-
out with great taste, and yet with the utmost
solidity. The floor above is also given over to
sleepmg accommodation, and both floors are
thoroughly equipped with bath-rooms, where hot
and cold water and all the other indispensables
of civilised existence may be always obtained.
Electric-bells are laid on throughout the building.
In the basement, asphalted and cemented from
end to end, are to be found the kitchen, splendidly
appointed, the servants’ hall, several storerooms
the beer and wine cellars, and the servants’ apart
ments. Outside are to be found the stables,
carriage-rooms, laundries, and public offices, while
a public ball adjoins the hotel, in dimension 95
by 45 feet, capable of seating several _ hundred
persons. Stratton’s Hotel, Waverley, is one of
the institutions of that charming suburb.*

fictitious, and gotten up for the purpose of creat-
ing a demand from the public. Especially have
we taken this view of those medicines largely
advertised to be taken internally, but the publica-
tion in various papers of the wonderful results
obtained from using that famous remedy St>
Jacobs oil, and from the fact that it is a remedy
for outward application only, led us to make trials
of it in our own family. One was a case of lum-
bago of long standing, which had previously
resisted every form of treatment and was per-
manently cured by a few applications of the oil.
Another was a sprained ankle with severe pain.
This was instantly relieved and permanently
cured in a few days by the use of St. Jacobs oil.
While for severe toothache and neuralgia it acted
almost like magic. Our own experience in using
the oil, as above indicated, was so highly satis-
factory that we determined in the interests of
the general public to make a thorough local
investigation among dealers and others who
had sold and used St. Jacobs oil. Recognising
Messrs. Taylor and Co. (Limited), as head-
quarters for all proprietary medicines, we
called at their Briggate store, and, on mak-
ing known the object of our visit to the
general manager, he stated that their three stores
in Leeds were selling more than a thousand
bottles of St. Jacobs oil every week, and the
trade was constantly increasing—that it was the
most popular remedy sold, and was highly spoken
of by every one who used it. The manager said
he had heard hundreds of people say they had
been permanently cured of rheumatism, neuralgia,
sciatica, and similar complaints by the use of
this famous oil, and that although they purchased
the oil in immense quantities direct from the pro-
prietors in London, the demand was so great that
it was with difficulty they were able to keep a
sufficient supply on hand.
THE ENTERPRISING YANKEE.
To produce a watch so simple in construction
that it could be sold cheaper than any other, and
still be a reliable timekeeper, has been the pro-
blem for watchmakers the world over. The Swiss
developed the making of watches by hand to the
highest point, at the same time cheapening hand
labour to the utmost possible extent. The Ameri-
cans sought a solution in a different direction by
making the parts of their watches by machinery,
and interchange. However, the cost of manufac-
ture still remained tco great for the watch of the
million. An enterprising Yankee Company
finally solved the problem by dispensing with the
greater number of parts of a watch (reducing the
number from 1(50 to 57!) makiner all of them by
machinery, and so easy of adjustment that expert
labour was not needed to put them together.
This crowning achievement in the history of
watchmaking was accomplished by the Waterbury
Watch Company in their Waterbury Watch,
which, though cheap, is as perfect in its parts,
and as reliable in its timekeeping, as any watch
made. . .
Series “ E ” —the best form of the original
Waterbury—is a good serviceable watch produced
at a cost within the reach of all. Keyless, re-
liable, durable, and accurate, it is without a peer
for the man or boy in moderate circumstances.
Series “J” (gents’ size) and “L ” (ladies’ size)
are the latest productions of this famous factory.
They are short-winding, stem-winding, enamel-
dialled, jewelled, and dust-proof watches, with
duplex escapements; and are just as good time-
keepers as anyone could wish to carry. They
have been unanimously declared to be perfect
marvels of mechanical ingenuity. All these
watches are made by the best automatic machinery
and thus, in event of accident, can be efficiently
repaired at a nominal cost, at any of the com-
pany’s repair depots or agencies, established for
the convenience of wearers in various centres
throughout the colonies. The genuine Water-
bury Watches may be obtained from any respect-
able dealer or storekeeper. Price, Series “ E,”

(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
“ General Booth has collected £100,000 in aid of his
scheme for exporting paupers.”—Daily Press.
“ Sweep the gutters, cast the garbage on the clean,
unlittered ways,
In the hope its deadly odours may be sweetened
by the breath
Of the Southern air fresh blowing, and the bright
unclouded rays
Of a Southern sun may rob it of the venom of
its death.”
So cry they who made the garbage, they who
make the gutters flow
With the millions marching ever in the caravan
of crime,
With the hordes of pallid famine, with the thralls
of want and woe,
With the souls who reel, sin-sodden, all along our
piteous time.
The flood lias touched patrician feet, has stained
patrician clothes,
Has surged around the lofty peaks where proud
patricians sit ;
The odours of the charnel reek in each patrician
nose,
So arise they, in all charity, and cry “Away
with it.”
And the prelates from their places exclaim “Lo !
we have tried
To save them by the Gospel, by our sermons,
and by prayer;
Six feet deep have we with Bibles covered Eng-
land far and wide ;
We have failed. Great is our failure. Now
suppose we give them air.
“ Suppose we try sea-voyages as cure for chronic
crime,
And evict the ‘social problem ’ from the kennels
where it cowers '!
As the poor ‘ are always with us ’ we can spare
them for a time ;
‘Bear ye one another’s burdens’—let our
colonists bear ours !”
Then the lords of opportunity applauded,
everyone,
From the man who owned a palace to the man
who owned a shed,
From the man who owned a county where the
grouse and partridge run,
To the man who owned a property six hasty
steps might tread.
No! Not so! Australia’s farming must be good
from soil to seed.
Can you free the seed you send us from heredi-
tary taint ?
Shall we choke our comjng harvest with the
poisondom of weed !
For your sinner’s still a sinner, though he's
washed and labelled “ saint.”
Oh, Beloved Mother Country, all the poverty and
crime
That you seek to send, post-paid, across three
thousand leagues of foam,
Are results of your own lust and greed ; so, there-
fore, for this time
Let your charity’s beginning like its stopping
be at home.
Turn the millions on your acres, and evict the
fallow deer,
Force the idler from his carriage, let him earn
his daily bread.
If you will not—keep your vassals till in some dark
harvest year
Your social system’s shatter’d’ ’neath Red
Revolution’s tread.
EDWARD J. DEMPSEY.
One of the most amusing sketches in Lady
Dufferin’s new book is one of the Afghan Ameer’s
private executioner, clad in red velvet, and always
having his axe and strangling-rope fixed to his
person.
According to the cable, even the coolies
loathe the European blacklegs. It is a melancholy
fact, by the way, that during the recent great
Australian strike the blacklegs were chiefly Eng-
lish and Australian-born men; the “foreigners,”
almost to a man, refused to “turn dog.”
Good old Dr. Steel, the successor of John
Dunmore Lang as a Chinese enthusiast, assures
us that “the Chinese are awakening to a proper
understanding of Christianity.” That’s why they
resolutely avoid it. Confucius has believers who
practise what he inculcated ; Christ has represen-
tatives who preach His doctrines and grab wildly
to shake hands with Mammon.
A handsome piece of “skite” from the
Broken Hill (N.S.W.) Budget :
The whole of Pitt-street, Sydney, with the buildings on
either side of it, could lie hidden in payable ore in the
Broken Hill lode, and then there would be room for
Collins-street in Melbourne, Bundle-street in Adelaide,
and all the public-houses and churches in Australia, as
well as the Royal Navy and every merchant steamer in
the world, and supposing all the ore represented by these
streets and buildings and ships were taken out, there
would, to all appearances, still be left in the mines 50
years of profitable work, even if the quantity of ore
treated weekly were twice as great as it is now.
The trial and execution of Mrs. Pearcey
created a tremendous sensation in London. From
the comments of the papers it is plain that the
opposition of the intelligent classes to .the death-
penalty issteadily increasing. Mrs. Pearcey was
executed in face of the facts that she had a dis-
tinct history of four attempts at suicide, a well-
established hereditary predisposition to mental
disorder, and several officially-recorded attacks of
epilepsy. Dr. Forbes Winslow and five other
well-known lunacy experts vainly prayed for her
life. Her strangulation, like the thousands which
preceded it, conveys no moral to the potential
murderer. The British gallows may be immov-
able : but it cannot deal with the impulse which
is irresistible.
Au Auburn (N.S.W.) press-writer died
recently, and his successor in the ink-slinging line
ventures to remonstrate with “ our local preachers
and Sunday-school teachers ” for impressing upon
the minds of the lambs of the flock that the un-
lamented and lamentable deceased is, “ without a
doubt, burning in hell.” A stave —from The
Bulletin :
Dear Bulletin, —During the present week
an exceedingly pleasant “ fill-’em-Up-again ” soft
of dog began to stroll about Maryborough, Q.,
making the acquaintance of members of the com-
munity well-known for the determined stand they
had made against all attempts to collect amounts
alleged to be due by them for a certain biographical
work recently delivered to their order. “ Now,
sir,” he said to a victim who had fully explained
how shamefully he had been swindled by the
canvasser, “lean see you have been ‘had,’and,
so far as you are concerned, please consider that
my mission here is to chew pine-apples and
mangoes and to enjoy the scenery. Nevermind
your account. Before I goif you wish to pay me
you can, but if you do not, don’t, and there’s an
end to it. Still, you will join me in a drink
and be friends. Besides, I am advised from head-
quarters that there must have been some sharp
dealing as they think a man of your reputation
would scorn to repudiate any fair demand.” To
make a long story short, he contrived somehow to
impress each victim with a sense of the moral and
legal obligation he was under to pay the money,
and wound up with expressions of extreme regret
that he would be compelled to appear in court
against him when the time’arrived. “You are
the bull of the ring, you know, and we must beat
you to beat the others.” So much friendship and
respect soon began to tell on the “ bull,” and that,
together with a desire to merit the good opinion
head-quarters had been so kind as to entertain of
him, decided him to owe the money no longer, and
it was paid forthwith. One after another shared
the same fate until the clever party encountered
an undertaker from whom, after trying in vain to
squeeze the full amount, he insisted on receiving
coffins for the balance. The man of mourning,
questioning not the sincerity of the request, agreed,
and to his astonishment the agent hoisted a four-
feet coffin on to his shoulder and walked down the
crowded street to his hotel seemingly indifferent
to the astonishment he created. Accosted by one
of the citizens and asked his intentions he replied,
“ There’s a sick boy down my way. He can’t last
much longer. His mother is pretty poor and I
can let her have this cheap. I have a few more on
hand; (sizing him up) one of polished cedar that
would fit you to a hair without pinching.” Shortly
afterwards he was seen sending his uncanny lug-
gage to the wharf and booking his passage en route
for Sydney.—Yours, Maryborough (Q.)
It has hitherto often been the astonish-
ment of visitors to Sydney that in a semi-tropical
climate, and with unrivalled natural advantages,
people have been so wanting in enterprise as not to
have established long ago that healthful luxury, a
“ Natatorium. ” It is pleasing to note that no
longer can this taunt be applied, for a visit to
400 Pitt-street, Haymarket, will reveal to the
astonished citizen (without exception) the grandest
sea-water artificial swimming baths in the world.
Two enormous basins, each 100 x 50 feet, supplied
with fresh sea-water daily, and renewed as fre-
quently as necessary, afford ample space for lovers
of this manly, invigorating, and healthful art to
disport themselves. The depth of the baths is so
graduated as to suit both swimmers and non-
swimmers ; trapezes and other athletic appli-
ances, suspended from the lofty ceiling, are in
profusion; careful and polite attendants always
at hand to instruct beginners—this in itself
must command the baths to parents. Special
hours are reserved for ladies and children, during
which experienced female instructors are in con-
stant attendance. The dressing-rooms round the
baths are models of comfort and elegance, and
are replete with all the necessaries incidental to
bathing, whilst the splendid ventilation and
absolute cleanliness of the entire establishment
reflect the greatest credit on the management.
The charges of admission are so moderate as to
bring these baths into general use. The greatest
care being taken at the same time to keep them
select. Refreshments in the shape of tea, coffee,
etc., can be had at the entrance, and will bo
found of the best description. Visitors will omit
one of the sights of Sydney if they fail to see
these baths, an illustration of which, with the
splendid hotel attached to them, may be seen in
this issue. The popularity of these baths is already
assured and their success has been quite pheno-
menal.*'
What matter where?
You needn’t care.
You have no cause to holler.
When comes your end
You’ll find your friend ;
Why need you strain at collar ?
You’ll see his phiz,
For where he is,
There you are bound to foller.
Confidence.
Confidence in one’s self goes far towards success
The man who is able to tackle an ugly job, full}
sure that he can devise the ways and means oi
successfully completing the work, is the mar
valuable to an employer, and the one of most
value to the community. All men are not, how
ever, gifted alike in this respect; one man has the
capacity to think the matter out and reason with
himself how he can best overcome the difficulties
before him, while another will be overwhelmed
with the trouble. This latter kind is frequently
met with in this life, men who have not the force
of character to fight their way through difficulties,
nor the energy to carry their undertakings to a
successful issue. They are mostly thin, nervous
creatures, with a slow pulse and a weak heart.
They are physiologically constructed the same as
the robust and persistently energetic men. Such
men should take good exercise and generous food,
abstain from excitement, and where indigestion
and sallow or pale complexion, indicates anaemia
and sluggish liver, a proper course of Clements
Tonic will do much good. It will invigorate the
stomach and bowels, quicken the pulse, and revive
the depleted strength of the heart, aid digestion
and strengthen the nerves and promote the action
of the skin, liver and kidneys. Clements Tonic
has been used with such satisfactory results, that
we have great pleasure in submitting the following
evidence for perusal by our readers. The Rev. R
Laverty, Port Macquarie, N.S.W., writes:—“l
have much pleasure in bearing my testimony to
the efficacy of Clements Tonic. I was promptly
cured of facial neuralgia by the use of Clements
Tonic, experiencing relief in a few hours. It is
the best tonic I know.” Miss Emily Thorman, 95
Wilson-street, Golden Grove, N.S.W., says :—“I
suffered with liver complaint and indigestion for
two years and could neither eat nor sleep and was
reduced to almost a shadow. I tried all the
remedies I could think of. Reading of Clements
Tonic I resolved to try a bottle, and am thankful
to say it has made a new woman of me, and I am
only too thankful to be able to add my grateful
testimony.” H. E. Neale, Esq., Loco. De-
partment, Wellington, N.S.W., writes :—“ My
daughter has for the past seven months been
suffering excruciating agony from Neuralgia and
also extreme nervousness. I obtained for her
several so-called specifics but without avail. Sho
had no appetite and could scarcely eat a particle
of food, and was almost reduced to a skeleton
from want of food and loss of sleep. I saw
Clements Tonic highly spoken of, I determined to
try it and after she had taken six doses the pain
left, and she at once commenced to improve. She-
lias taken two bottles and is now quite herself
again. I shall always recommend Clements!
Tonic.”

Verse We Have Head.
The Barings were near taking up the con-
struction of the Victorian railways, 35 years ago.
Childers, arriving in London from Melbourne, got
a commission to return as the Barings’ agent, but
could not negotiate the Railways, though he
would have succeeded but for O’Shanassy replacing
Haines as Premier. A smart man of the time was
Gabrielli, who provided a million loan for the
Melbourne Corporation, though he hadn’t a
copper.
One of the recent rumours started by the
religious British press is that Parnell attended
the meetings of the Home Rule members with a
loaded revolver in his pocket, and manifested a
badly-disguised inclination to open fire on Hcaly
or any other individual who disagreed with him.
The Bulletin is in a position to contradict this
report on reliable cable authority. Instead of a
revolver Parnell carried a bow and arrow, a
boomerang, one battering-ram, two torpedoes, a
dozen stink-pots, a small portable gallows, and a
quantity of nitro-glycerine, but otherwise he was
unarmed and manifested no warlike tendencies.
Another item of telegraphic information which
has reached this paper states that her Majesty in-
tends to elope with the Pope. Further details
are expected shortly.
Apropos to the present or recent Indian
rising, old Californians tell diverting stories of
how they used to raise a pool of, say, 5000 dollars
whenever a warlike tribe of Injins began to worry
the palefaces. A deputation would then wait
upon the boss chief of another warlike tribe, and
make arrangements to buy 250 scalps of the oppo-
sition lot at 20 dollars per scalp ! At the end of
a fortnight the whole pool would be applied for,
the rising suppressed, and the victorious mer-
cenaries busily engaged in drinking themselves
off the face of the earth. Thus the astute Cali
forniam syndicate decimated two tribes at com-
paratively small expense, and when 'the Govern-
ment at Washington desired to make enquiries
into this “very serious ” matter, they were satisfied
with a sort of unofficial assurance, emanating
from nowhere in particular, that it wasn’t a
serious matter at all. Nowadays they seem to be
wiping out the noble savage on the regular
system, which is more English, vou know, but
very costly and cumbersome. The army, we
grieve to read, has even sunk to the absurdity of
“ capturing prisoners” when civilisation is panting
for scalps.
A pleasant social evening was spent at the
Melbourne quarantine station the other day on
the arrival of the smallpox-stricken Kelton. There
are various highly-paid officials whose business it
is to fool round the quarantine ground, but they
were all absent, and nobody could find them,
The bedsteads were there, but the bedding had
been put away somewhere and forgotten, and
most of the keys had been mislaid, so that nobody
could get in, and the only place to lay a patient
was under a tree. Eighteen policemen had been
telegraphed for to form a “cordon,” but most of
them had got lost in the woods, and were cursing
at large and falling over roots. The linen had all
been packed in the oven, and the cooking utensils
had been standing for ten months in the sink, and
the surgical instruments were mostly in the coal-
box, and the only tooth-brush in the place was on
the roof, having been thrown at a cat early the
previous year. Officials of various degrees of
importance wore arriving in haste and falling over
each other at the gate, and shivering round among
the trees because the key hadn't been found, and
the towels and soap Were lying on a s’tmup beside
the front window; and the Kelton herself was
stranded in the mud right opposite the station,
having missed her way up the harbour, and three
tugs were whistling, and burning blue lights.
Also, there was a heavy sea on, with occasional
showers, and among all this frenzy the Health
Department plunged round in the dark and fell
over everything, and wished that it was dead.
Editor Bulletin. Sir, You enquire
about the release of a young man who got 18
months for forging his mother’s name to a p.n.,
the jury in whose case would have returned a ver-
dict of acquittal but for the persistence of the
Judge (Innes), who pointed out that if the accused
were acquitted the public would say there was in
N.S. Wales one law for the rich and another for
the poor. How far this was interfering with the
sacred right of the jury to independence in the
matter I leave to others to judge. But Ido Want
to know when these 15 or 20 men who have no
friends at court and who have been in gaol for
over 10 years (one for 25, another for 18, and so
on) are likely to have their oases considered ? Or
will they be deferred until the jubilee of the
Prince of Wales as King of England occurs? Why
should their cases be undetermined because one
old man stands in the way of the release of the
oldest in confinement ? Ido not know if there be
any truth in the statement that private pique
is at the bottom of this man’s long imprisonment,
but if it be it is a gross reflection on our
common humanity. Have we no Howard in the
colonial Parliament who will for a time put aside
“ the bridge agin his own door ” and make inquiry
into the position of these wretches who are
going through a living death ? I know of one
man in Darlinghurst now who has done six years
out of 10 given him by a cruel judge for what is
known as “sweating” a horse, an offence for
which he would now get 12 months. By the way,
there is a legend about this case, that the judge
sentenced him to five years “cumulative ” for the
saddle, but on the people in court loudly exclaim-
ing “Too much!” he consented to make it
“concurrent.” — Yours, &c., Lex.
f Sydney Star, which evidently has on', its
staff a Melican man, or a Maorilander (who is
next door to a Melican man), thus discourses on
the death last week, at ’Prisoo, through Bright’s
disease, of King Kalakaua, of Hawaii: —
Kalakaua \vas a fine, healthy old specimen of a monarch.
When “ called to the throne ” he was sitting with his legs
dangling over the wharf fishing with the rest of “ the
boys,” and he wouldn’t leave to receive the congratula-
tions of his loving people till he had gathered up his
hooks and lines, and done his share of the knuckle of cold
pork and bread and cheese and onions. “Besides,” he
remarked, “he knew well the moment he was gone they
would 1 sneak ’ a moki or kawi out of one of the fishing
boats from Monowai—the island opposite—and swear they
had caught it, and so ‘break his record.’” He knew his
mates too well to be had on the king racket. He
was a Kammehama, a descent of the great kings of
Hawaii, who drove the other “push” over the Pali, a
precipice of about 5000 ft. “sheer.” Kalakaua had a few
thousand subjects, who were ruled with all the pomp and
.pageantry of an Eastern Court. He had two Parliaments,
or two Houses of Parliament, consisting of members
without boots or trousers. The Minister for Defence
ruled an army of ten, armed with Queen Bess muskets,
and his Majesty’s navy consisted of a whale-boat and a
condemned schooner of 50 tons. His regiments had no
one of a lesser grade than a colonel, and one out of every
ten of his subjects was a judge. The onlv good thing
about the court is the king’s band. The “nigs” take kindly
to blowing, and there is a band of 50 attached to the
court which would hold its own in London or Vienna.
Honolulu is a delightful place. No one ever seems to
work or go to bed except during the day. The
Hawaiians never took kindly to the missionaries, save aS
articles of diet, and they claimed to be able to dis-
tinguish orthodox churchmen from dissenters by the
taste. Add to this that the women ride straddle-legged,
and are as beautful as Houris of Paradise, that it you
tickle the soil with a hoe it smiles in yams and all sorts
of fruits; that it has literally no winter at all nor any hot
summers ; that its waters are blue as indigo save where
they curl like the finest lace over lovely reefs; that its
vegetation, including the stately cocoanut-tree and
banana-groves, is sans compare, and you have an earthly
paradise—one which it is a shame to disturb with what
is called “civilisation.”
The Present Crisis.
When a deed is done for Freedom, through the
broad earth’s aching breast
Rsns a thrill of joy prophetic, trembling on from
east to west;
And the slave, where’er he cowers, feels the soul
within him climb
To the awful verge of manhood, as the energy
sublime
Of a century bursts full-blossomed on the thorny
stem of Time,
For mankind are ope in spirit, and an instinct
bears along
Round the earth’s electric circle the swift flash of
right or wrong;
Whether conscious or unconscious, yet Humanity’s
vast frame
Through its ocean-sundered fibres feels the gush
of joy or shame;
In the gain or loss of one race all the rest have
equal claim.
Once to every man and nation comes the moment
to decide
In the strife of Truth with Falsehood for the good
or evil side;
Some great cause, God’s new Messiah, offering
each the bloom or blight,
Parts the goats upon the left hand, and the sheep
upon the right,
And the choice goes by for ever ’twixt that dark-
ness and that light.
Then to side with truth is noble, when we share
her wretched crust,
Ere her cause bring fame and profit, and ’tis pro-
sperous to be just;
Then it is the brave man chooses, while the
coward stands aside,
Doubting in his abject spirit, till bis Lord is
crucified,
And the multitude make virtue of the faith they
had denied.
Count me o’er earth’s chosen heroes - they were
souls that stood alone,
While the men they agonised for hurled the con-
tumelious stone,
Stood serene, and down the future saw the golden
beam incline
To the side of perfect justice, mastered by their
faith Divine,
By one man’s plain truth to manhood and to God’s
supreme design.
For humanity sweeps onward ; where to-day the
martyr stands
On the morrow crouches Judas, with the silver in
his hands;
Far in front the cross stands ready, and the
crackling faggots burn,
While the hooting mob of yesterday in silent awe
return
To glean up the scattered ashes into history’s
golden urn.
J. R. LOWELL.
Lincoln’s Melancholy.
His Sympathetic Nature and his Early
Misfortunes.
Those who saw much of Abraham Lincoln
during the latter years of his life were greatly
impressed with the expression of profound melan-
choly his face always wore in repose.
Mr. Lincoln was of a peculiarly sympathetic
and kindly nature. These strong characteristics
influenced, very happily, as it proved, his entire
political career. They would not seem at first
glance to be efficient aids to political success ; but
in the peculiar emergency which Lincoln, in the
providence of God, was called to meet no vessel
of common clay could possibly have become the
“ chosen of the Lord.” Those acquainted with
him from boyhood knew that early griefs tinged
his whole life with sadness. His partner in the
grocery business at Salem was “Uncle” Billy
Green, of Tallula, HI., who used at night, when
the customers were few, to hold the grammar
while Lincoln recited his lessons. It was
to his sympathetic ear that Lincoln told the
story of his love for sweet Ann Rutledge.
And he, in return, offered what comfort he
could when poor Ann died, and Lincoln’s
great heart nearly broke. “After Ann died,”
says “Uncle” Billy, “on stormy nights, when
the wind blew the rain against the roof, Abe
would sit thar in the grocery, his elbows on
his knees, his face in his hands, and the tears
runnin’ through his fingers. I hated to see
him feel bad, an’ I’d say, ‘Abe, don’t cry,’and
he’d look up an’ say, ‘ I can’t help it, Bill, the
rain’s afallin’ on her.’” There are many
who can sympathise with this overpowering
grief, as they think of a lost loved one, when
“the rain’s a-falling on her.” What adds poig-
nancy to the grief sometimes is the thought
that the lost one might have been saved.
Fortunate, indeed, is Colin MTherson, of
Shepparton, Victoria, proprietor of Sheppab-
ton News, who writes under date of 24th
May, 1890:—“Nearly three years since I began
to lose my health. Suffering no pronounced
pains at first, with the exception of a general
languid feeling, I was then not able to satisfy my-
self as to the diagnosis of my trouble, but subse-
quent symytoms proved the presence of disease of
the kidneys and liver. I suffered from impaired
digestion, nausea, loss of appetite, and at times
my pains were so intense that I imagined my
constitution was breaking up. Such was my state
of health when I first began the use of Warner’s
Safe Cure. With the use of a few bottles the
languid feeling began to wear off, my appetite,
which I had completely lost, returned, and my
restoration to health was rapid and complete.
Warner’-s Safe Cure has removed every trace of
kidney disease, and I feel better than ever I did
during the past decade.”

A LADY’S VISIT TO A JAPANESE
THEATRE.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
It would not do for any lady unacquainted
with the manners and customs of the Japanese
generally to enter a native theatre haphazard
Vvith the intention of witnessing a performance,
rot the chances are; should she elect so to do, she
ivquld light upon a play she could hot comfortably
lyitneSs; . To please a Japanese aUaienbe thb shovV
uiilst be brimful, of liptfcprs; or as it;
“ have plenty of sorrow in it.” I had been resi-
dent some time in Yokohama before I ventured
into a Japanese theatre, though I had long wanted
to do so, and there are two excellent play-houses
in the native town which borders'on the Foreign
Concession. One 1 day it was announced that a
party of clever actors from Kioto and Osaka were
to perform a celebrated;play, “The Forty-seven
Ronins,” founded on a tale of Japanese vendetta.
Having seen the grave of the real, actors in the
tragedy, I was most anxious to go, and we went
that very evening.
* * i
A plhy in Japan often commenced early ih
the morniilg and prdceed§ fbr several days. Grbat;
therefore; ;was hiy gobd little Aniah’s dstonishmbnt
ivheti shCjfqpricbyre did hot intefid sthrtihg fbritne
theatre until 'after early dinner in the evening;
and that we should return shortly after 10 p.m.
Dinner over, we found the jinrickshas waiting.
These carriages are a sort of adult-perambulators
drawn generally by one man in the shafts. In the
case, however, of hilly country or a long journey
two men, tandem, draw while one pushes behind,
# * *
Though the sun had set it wa's not dark.
The sky was beautifully clear and the air fresh
and bracing. Thoroughly did I enjoy the
ever-varying drive along the Bluff, fenced in here
and there by tall, well-kept hedges, at other
places getting pretty glimpses of surrounding
country. Right before us stood Fusiyama, the
beautiful, garbed in a raiment of snow, that
modestly veiled the loveliness of her peerless form
in draperies of misty cloud. It is a good drive
through the Concession to where the theatre, a
large, square building, stands. Arrived at the
door the first thing to be done was to purchase our
tickets. They turned out to be most substantial
—none of your flimsy pieces of card-board or
paper, but good-sized flat boards, which were
afterwards taken by one of the attendants who
showed us to our places.
* * *
. On entering we found the theatre in many
respects similar to our own, but more rudely
finished. There was a stage at one end with a
decorated front brilliant in the richest colour; a
row of boxes all around hung with lanterns, and a
flat floor answering exactly to our pit. This floor
was divided into squares and rented to the audi-
ence, the ticket showing proprietorship being one
of the large boards before-mentioned, A platform
goes right through the audience in the pit and
leads to the stage. It is frequently made use of
by the actors to show the beauty of their costumes,
and we were fortunate enough to secure a box
from which a good view of both platform and
stage could be obtained. The stage-front was
ornamented by a beautifully-worked crimson cur-
tain, which I was told had been embroidered by
all the Geishas or singing-girls in the neighbour-
hood, who take unbounded interest in matters
theatrical. The prompter sat behind a brilliantly-
painted latticed screen oh ofie side of the plat-
fbhxi; aiid the Orchestra; tight at .the back of the
stage;, Cbfasisted of about 50_ihusibiahs; iyhb were
seated on a sort of raised dais in rows bnh abovh
the other, their instruments being of the guitar
order. The squares in the pit were occupied
generally by family-parties—grandfather, grand-
mother, son and daughter, and all the olive
branches down to the smallest baby. A visit to
the theatre vvas evidently a great occasion. The
gifls had taken great pains With their drfeSs, theif
phir ifibst .elabofatieiy arraiiged, all their best
hair-pins had been bh. and. a batid q’f bright
crepe peeped out from among the glossy dresses.
» , # *
One family party was seated immediately
in front of us. A friend, who had taken his
water-colours to make a sketch of the inside of
the theatre, touched one of the young girls on the
neck with his brush. Instead of tossing her head,
resenting it as a liberty or looking as if some deep
Insult had been offered, as most of our own girls
ivoUld have dohe, she turned towards us with a
broad stnile , which deepened into a merry laugh
when told in her bwfa language that it was a
big fly.” She was really Very pretty* her face a
perfect tWal lighted tip by. a pair df almond-shaped
black eyes, eyebrows dblicately atqhed, lohg
Straight hose ahd a rosy little inoUth Whibh was a
perfect Gupid’s bow—-disclosing, when she smiled;
two rows of pearly white teeth. Tier face and
neck were liberally decorated with rice powder,
and the creamy white of her skin was accentuated
and brought out by the artificial tingeing of the
lips and cheeks. She had on what was evidently
her best dark-blue silk dress, her scarlet chemise
peeped out from beneath her black velvet collar,
and her dress was bound round her waist by a
broad bright obi or sash made also of silk and
lined with satin. A woman in Japan never does
' her own hair and seldom ties her own sash, this
task nearly always devolving on mother, sister, or
friend, so much depends on the perfect sit of the
bow or fold behind.
j, * * #
Nothing can possibly be more charming
than the manner of a well-brought-up Japanese
woman. It is invariably simple, gentle, and
courteous; there is perfect ease and an utter ab-
sence of self-consciousness; nor is there the least
approach to anything that would strike you as
being forward or wanton. Spartan-like, the
Japanese pay great respect to the aged. All
children are early taught that on them will
devolve the duty of providing for their parents in
old age, guarding them from want and misery of
every kind, and, if possible, maintaining them in
ease and comfort during their last years. We
noticed that the place of honour immediately in
front of each square was given to the old lady and

ing, an attendant came and collected all the san-
dals ; the Japanese having no hats to take off,
remove their shoes instead. These were num-
bered and corresponding numbers given to the
owners. It was a most orderly, well-behaved
company, amongst whom the greatest good-humor
and politeness reigned.

The neighbourhood of the theatre abounds
in tea-houses, from which you can procure refresh-
ment if you do not wish to leave until the day’s
performance is over. The poorer class of people
go provided, and between the acts little boxes
containing all sorts of refreshments are produced
from unknown quarters : kettles of hot water are
brought iff for the tea-drinkers, and small fur-
hahep galled “habichs,” containing live coals, are

appear on the stage in Japan as singers add

it is hard to realise they are mot really women.
A dramatic scene between Daimio, one, of The
old Feudal lords, and an old retainer was especially
interesting. He entered; with a number of his
retainers; Samurai, in their military dress. The
dignity of his manner, free from affectation of any
kind, and the respect paid to him, devoid of all
obsequiousness, Were extremely pleasing. You
had a gfehtlemaU before you who was capable of

members of old families. 'They forjpefJ, top
military element of Japan and were distinct from
all other classes; they were at the immediate
command of their lord, and wore his crest upon
their dress (a dress especially their own) and bore
two swords— one thrust through the folds of their
belts, another at their side. The wearing of
these swords was a special badge of aristocracy,
and, no matter how poor they might be, gave
them immense privileges over ordinary people.
The under-garment of the Samurais was a sort of
long, loose, kilted trouser, which fell in straight
folds from the waist—in fact, a divided skirt.
They never engaged in trade —which was regarded
as derogatory to the dignity of a soldier. They
received pay in kind, had quarters in the castle
grounds, and were provided in dress and accoutre-
ments by their Daimio, to whom they were ex-
ceedingly loyal. The old feudal castles are still
to be seen, with their stone battlements sur-
rounded by moats covered with lotus-flowers and
water-lilies and approached by drawbridges. The
feudal system, however,, passed away with the old
form of government and the Tycoon. Each
Daimio had his. small court, his ministers and
officials being taken from the Samurai.
# # #
It is related that after the advent of
foreigners a Daimio witnessed a review of British
soldiers in Yokohama. When the exhibition was
over he turned to Sir Rutherford Alcock, who was
at that time British Ambassador, and said :
“ My retinue are few, and their tactics not
worthy of notice after what I have seen; still,”
added he with pride, “ there is not a
man amongst them who, if I say ‘ die!’
will not sacrifice his life at my com-
mand.” And it was quite true. The
retainers were very jealous of any disrespect
shown to their lord, and would immediately
avenge a proffered insult. In this way some very
tragic events have taken place. A Daimio had
but to command one of his subjects to commit
suicide and he was bound in all honour to do so.
The small sword that a Samurai carried In bis
belt was placed there and used for this social
purpose. Under the old Government a man might
do the darkest deeds of violence provided he com-
mitted hari-kari afterwards. This was a very

founded the drama we had come to witness.

Instead of the scenery slicing jbacky as bttr#
does, there was moveable machinery dn pC&tm
that turned it round and altered it. Boys,with
black caps drawn over their faces, after the!
fashion of the harlequins in the pantomime, and
supposed, like them, to be invisible, followed the
actors about the stage with long poles on the end
of which candles were fixed. During certain pas-
sages in the play they knelt behind them and
adroitly threw the light upon their faces, so that
the audience might see the different expressions
of countenance. They wept in silence during
the love-passages and partings—there was no
kissing, i The old Japanese (who neither kissed
nor “ cussed ”) knew nothing of this Western
mode of testifying affection. A, little comedy was
occasionally introduced, and the jokes made by
the actors were thoroughly appreciated by the
audience, who laughed, applauded, and called
out the : names of their favourite players, who,
sometimes would good-naturedly answer them
back. The chief actor in Japan is Danjero—he is
their Irving or Booth. ;

What we are Prepared to d®
Wo are prepared to supply 100,000 of the Australa-
sian public with samples of FRAZER’S SULPHUR
TABLETS, gratis and post free.
A W®rd ®f Adiric©.
Don’t write for the samples simply because we offer
them free of charge, nor because your neighbour does.
Read our advertisement through to the end, and then
decide whether you or yours need or would be benefited
by the use of FRAZER’S SULPHUR TABLETS.
We do not pose as philanthropists. This is a business
offer. We have an article that we know from severe
tests and from results achieved will sell on its merits if
seen, tasted and tested. Sulphur is the oldest, the best,
and safest remedy for the blood, for the skin, for the
complexion, for rheumatism, and for constipation.
FRAZER’S SULPHUR TABLETS are composed of
sulphur incorporated with cream of tartar and other
curative ingredients. They are much more efficacious
than sulphur in milk or treacle. This has been proved
time and again. They are liked. Men favour them,
women hail them as a boon, and children think them as
pleasant to eat as confectionary. They benefit all, and
are as efficacious and curative as they are safe and agree-
able.
Their Success.
“ FRAZER’S SULPHCJR TABLETS” are the
latest and greatest British success. They have so much
merit as to always do good. They are so palatable and
agreeable that a child will take them with delight. They
are so safe that the weakest person may take them with-
out injury. They benefit every function of the body by
tonic action on the blood vessels.
This is what people ask us. We reply, because
those who write for the samples afterwards buy packets
of FRAZER’S SULPHUR TABLETS by post from
us, or obtain them from chemists, stores, or medicine
vendors. Peojde likewise recommend and keep the
Tablets by them. The consequence is that we sell several
hundred dozen packets weekly, and the sale is rapidly
growing. This is trade by merit. The public have
shown discrimnation, and that they can appreciate merit,
and it was in firm reliance that this would be the case
that we were led to incur this risk.
D® I meed them ?
If you have Rheumatism, Yes. They will kill the
decomposed and poisonous excess of uric acid in the blood
causing the disease.
If yon have Constipation, Yes. They are a gentle,
safe, and a simple laxative, as suitable for children (in
smaller doses) as for adults.
If you have Hemorrhoids, Yes. They relieve the
congestion of venous blood at the affected parts, and
afford relief.
If you have Ulcers, Scrofula, Scurvy, or other
i mpurities of the blood, Yes. They neutralise the blood
poisons causing the diseases and expel them out of the
system.
If you have Skin Disease or Eruption, Yes. They
have a specific curative effect on all such, as they open
the pores from internally, and free them from obstruction
and disease taint. They likewise control where they do
not kill the disease principle from the blood, which causes
Eczema and other diseases.
Write a letter or post-card to the Australasian Depot, naming The Bulletin, and samples of FRAZER’S SULPHUR TABLETS
will be sent you gratis and post free. They are for internal use for the Blood, Skin, Fevers, Complexion, Rheumatism, and Constipation. They
ward ofl Typhoid and all other inactions and contagious diseases. They are put up in packets, price in New South Wales, Is. 6d.; in Victoria,
Is. 9d. (postage 2d. per packet cRi i), of all chemists and storekeepers throughout Australasia.

LADIES' NIGHT, MONDAYS. 7 till 9.30, in charge of a Lady Professional,
“Major Wissman, chief of the German
expedition in East Africa, has been declared in-
sane, and recalled. ” —( Cable.)
Suggestively writes Madame Severine :
Some of the “advanced” women want no defenders-
They wish to fight themselves and suppress man in
duelling, as they would suppress him in political and
conjugal life. Poor man ! I never looked upon him in
this light. I always supposed that he had a role in the
family, in life ; that he owed assistance and protection to
woman, from whom he asked in exchange only partial
obedience. lam too much of a woman to have more than
feminine bravery. I could do my duty before a danger
that threatens the weak, the suffering, and the wounded,
but 1 have only civil, not military, courage. My
“ inferiority ” troubles me not in the least. I like to
be loved and protected, but I can repay' all the love and
protection by affection, mending linen, and preparing
good food. These good women would be grotesque on
the field of honour, and what man would follow them ?
If he wound a woman he is odious ; if he be wounded, he
is ridiculous. Prove the contrary if you can !
How is it that none of the great Frenchwomen,
or, in fact, any of the Frenchwomen at all, howl
for the franchise ?
London Figaro, starting off with the in-
genuous truth that “Lord and Lady Carington
are almost worshipped in Australia,” goes on to
relate a pathetic incident of the “farewell cere-
mony ” —presumably in Sydney—which came
under the notice of some vague, mysterious
“ Spectator,” and was first published to the
world in certain Australian papers of dubious
identity. This spectator (sex unknown) with the
“volleys of cheers still ringing in my ears ” was
startled by the apparition of “a neatly-dressed
girl of some 17 or 18 years, holding the hand! of a
little child of about 12, who was sobbing bitterly.”
Considering that the whole continent was sup-
posed to be weeping for the worshipped departers
at the moment, there was nothing special about
this particular infant’s burst of woe, yet
Spectator “enquired whether the little girl had
been hurt.” Whereupon the young lady ex-
plained that her sister was not exactly hurt from
the exterior, but suffering from a broken heart
because Lady Carington was going away. This
statement aroused the curiosity of Spectator,
whose questions elicited the fact that the little
girl had been laid up in the hospital
and visited more than once by the Governor’s wife.
It was a distressing scene. 'Spectator tried hard
to comfort the little girl, but without avail. “ She
kept repeating in heart-rending accents, “I’ll
never see my guardian angel no more.’” And
there the yarn ends. The “ loyal ” London shop-
keepers and other members of the middle toady
classes who get their ideas of Australian senti-
ment from papers like Figaro would doubtless
like to hear what became of that little girl
after her guardian angel departed. The Bul-
letin will tell them. The child slowly pined
and died until her brain gave way. Then
she arose from her bed in the middle of the night
when the sun was shining (the Australian sun
being high in the Heavens at such times) and went
forth and drowned herself. After which she re-
fused food for several days and eventually ex-
pired, turning her fresh chubby little face to the
wall and saying, “ She wos werry good to me, she
wos.” Just at that moment it occurred to the
bereaved mother to whisper, “Lady Jarsey will
be coming over soon ” in her deceased darling’s
deaf ear. The result can be easily imagined. A
little shudder shook the lifeless form showing that
the departed spirit had returned to its earthly
casket, which was instantly restored to rude
health.

The Earl of Harrowby—whoever he may
be—writes to an English paper stating that ‘ the
Church of England never suggested Free Educa-
tion, and from an educational point of view the
Church is very dubious as to the working of such
a scheme.” The Bishops of Lichfield, Carlisle,
and Rochester jointly denounce Free Education
as “ a worthless and shameless piece of political
expediency,” and the Rev. Lee, of All Saints,
Lambeth, has sent a written snort to the London
Council, in which he curses at the whole school
system because it benefits “ the selfish Radical,
the pampered loafer, and the man in the gutter.”
Poor, corpulent, bloated old hypocrites ! What a
racket there will be some day when the man in the
gutter gets up and squares accounts with them.
Where does the glorious principle of
“ freedom of contract ” begin? A few weeks ago
tenders were called for the erection of a residence
in Ballarat, and the contractor who got the work
sublet the carpentery, plumbing, and painting.
One smart young carpenter, finding the thraldom
of the employer too much for him, sent in a
tender for the woodwork—and got it; whereupon
the successful tenders for the other two branches
threatened to “ throw it up ” if he was allowed to
go on with his contract, as he was not a member
of the Contractors’ Association. And he had to
do it, too, as they would not allow him even the
alternative of joining the association !
Lockwood, the most eminent English
barrister in matrimonial cases, has been urging
that breach of promise actions ought to be

pecuniary outlay, to be reimbursed.

party.
While struggling to make headway, George
Sand called for encouragement on M. Keratry, a
popular, middle-aged novelist. Found him with
his young wife, who took no sort of notice of
George Sand, and Keratry’s advice was: “Try
rather to produce children than novels,” where-
upon Madame Dudevant retorted ; “I think yon
had better take that advice yourself.”
Governor “ Jarsey ” admits that he has
a weakness for mining speculations. Well, he has
struck the right spot to humour his taste. Aus-
tralia holds tlie richest gold, silver, and tin mines
in the world —viz., the Mount Morgan (Q.), the
Broken Hill Proprietary (N.S.W.), and the Mount
Bisohoff, Tasmania. It also holds the meanest
lot of wild-cat concerns on which lord or slave
ever “ went broke. ”
The Census Fiend is due round about on
5th April, and a sinking feeling occurs in the
Gushing Thing who is never a day over 18 on her
birthday, and a. strong, inward foreboding per-
vades the innermost part of the gentleman with
dyed hair, and life is beginning to mock dismally
at the gold-washed widow who wants to keep her
ten ravenous olive-branches strictly on the weather
bow, so to speak. By the bye, all the domestic
animals have to be billed in due form, and the
blue pencil will be busy in at least one Sydney
house —where they have 15 full-grown Thomas
felines to have their age, ailments, and religious
convictions deeply gone into, and one of the pam-
pered darlings has a name six syllables long.
The Empress Eugenie, it is recorded, once
fell a victim to the vulgar desire for display.
There was to be a grand ball at the Tuileries,
and it entered the oriflamme head of Napoleon’s
consort to make herself even more resplendent
than was her wont. To attain this result, she
gave orders that a magnificent article of jewellery
should be made for her, whose like had never been
seen before. With lavish band the purest dia-
monds were collected, and in order to swell the
number still further, Eugenie did not hesitate to
enter the Treasury and make an inroad upon the
historic jewels of former sovereigns. Among the
rest the ear-rings of the unfortunate Marie An-
toinette were taken, and their gems reft from
their settings, which latter were debased to the
ignominy of “ old gold.” The eventful night
came, and when the ball was at its height, the
Empress entered. All eyes were at once turned
toward her. She was adorned with the new
article of jewellery regarding which all Paris had
been agog with curiosity. It was a diamond
zone, several inches wide, and so brilliant its
dazzling lustre that the Empress seemed cut in
two at the waist-line, and as the gems reflected
the rays from a thousand points of light, the
divided figure walked through the throng of
spectators, who were fascinated and repelled by
the weird effect of two halves of a human form
moving, yet separated from each other, by the
band of light. Eugeni® never wore the diamond
zone again.

Galvanic Battery
Is acknowledged by Eminent Physicians, and by
thousands of sufferers to be a positive Remedy for
nearly all the ailments mankind is heir to. The effi-
cacy of this Wonderful Invention as a curative agent
is certainly The Crowning Medical and Scien-
tific Triumph of the 19th Century. '
This BATTERY is not larger than a half-crown
piece, and is worn on the chest, next the skin, suspen-
ded by a silk cord around the neck. The several
metals of which it is composed are so arranged that the
natural humidity of the ski n is sufficient to set the chem-
icals in the amalgamated metals in motion, generating
a constant but gentle flow of Electricity which passes
from the Battery into the system, purifying the Blood,
strengthening the Nerves'Brain and Muscles, infusing
fresh vigor into the Debilitated Constitution, Stimu-
lating the Vital Organs to their proper action and en-
abling nature to throw off numerous diseases.
The Battery will cure the following ailments
Headache, Rheumatism, Sciatica, Neuralgia, Ulcers,
and Tumors, Nervous Debility, Impotence, Liver Com-
plaints, Fever and Ague, Disease of the Kidneys and
Urinal Organs, Bronchitus, Asthma, Diphtheria, Fits,
Constipation, Piles, Heart Disease, Paralysis, Disease
of the Lungs and Throat, Skin Disorders, and almost
every form of Aches and Pains.
The Battery has a soothing effect upon children

OKN CERTIFICATE. —One of Thousands more.
Noble-street, Newton, Geelong,
„ T . 10th December, 1888.
To H. P. Kugelmann, Esq.
Dear Sir,—This is to certify that I, Patrick Keenan, was
taken ill about three years ago with a severe cold which
turned into Bronchitis and became chronic. I consulted
more than one doctor, and during that time took a great
quantity of medicine without it doing me the slightest
good, hut I became worse every day, wasting away until
1 became a perfect skeleton. About February last I began
to spit up blood, and what with the cough and severe
pains in my left lung, and the quantity of bad matter I
was expectorating every day, I became very much alarmed.
Hearing of your professional skill I consulted you, and
you told me you could cure me for a given sum 1 agreed
went under your treatment mAlai-ch last. At th»
lend of three months I was taken bad one morning, and
vomited about two pints of blood, matter and stringy
phlegm. 1 roiii that time I commenced to improve and
was gaming in weight every day. About a mouth ago the
blood ceased coming, the cough disappeared, and the
lung healed completely, and thank God and your pro-
fessional skill, I am as well as ever.
P. KEENAN.
Declared and subscribed before me, one of Her Majesty's
Justices of the Peace, for the Southern Bailiwick, in the
County of Grant, this 10th day of December, 1888.
