FOB EVER.
Out of the body for ever,
Wearily sobbing, “ Oh, whither ?”
A Soul that hath wasted its changes
Floats on the limitless Ether !
Lost in dim, horrible blankness ;
Drifting like Wind on a Sea,
Untraversed and vacant and moaning,
Nor s allow nor shore on the lee !
Helpless, unfriended, forsaken ;
Haunted and tracked by the Past,
With fragments of pitiless voices,
And desolate faces, aghast!
One saith —“ It is well that, he goeth
Naked and fainting with cold,
Who worshipped his sweet-smelling garmentt,
Arrayed with the,cunning of old !
“ Hark ! how he crieth, my brothers,
With pain for the glittering things ,
He saw on the shoulders of Rulers,
And the might in the mouths of the King l l
“ This Soul hath been one of the idlers
Who wait with still hands, when they lack,
For Fortune, like Joseph, to throw them
The cup thrust in Benjamin's sack.
" Now, had he been faithful in striving,
And warring with Wrong to the sword,
He must have passed over these spaces
Caught up in the arms of the Lord."
A second : “ Lo, Passion was wilful ;
And, glad with voluptuous sighs,
He held it luxurious trouble
To ache for luxurious eyes !
“ She bound him, the woman resplendent;
She withered his strength with her stare ;
And Faith hath been twisted and strangled
With folds of her luminous hair !
“ Was it well, O you wandering wailer,
Abandoned in terrible space.
To halt on the highway to Heaven
Because of a glittering face ? ”
And another: “ Behold, he was careful:
He faltered to think of his Youth,
Dejected and weary and footsore,
Alone on the dim road to Truth.
“ If the way had been shorter and greener
And brighter, he might have been brave ;
But, the goal was too far, and he fainted
Like Peter with Christ on the wave ! "
Beyond the wild haunts of the mockers—
Far in the distance and gray,
Floateth that sorrowful spirit
Away, and away, and away.
Pale phantoms fly past it, like shadows :
Dim eyes that are blinded with tears ;
Old faces all white with affliction —
The ghosts of the wasted dead years !
“ Soul that hath ruined us, shiver
And moan when you know us,” they cry—
" Behold! I was part of thy substance
“ And I"—saith another —“ and 11"
Drifting from starless abysses
Into the Ether sublime,
Where is no upward nor downward.
Nor region, nor record of Time l
Out of the Body for ever
No refuge—no succour nor stay—
Floated that sorrowful Spirit
Away, and away, and away.
— Henry Kendall, in The Australasian, September 8,
1866.
Of Adam. Lindsay Gordon.
(“With Whom Be Peace!”)
JUNE, 1870, and it is bitter cold ia Mel-
bourne. No leafless boughs as yet to hiss
in the west wind ; no trams passing with a
cheery whirr; Burke and Wills in placid
rigidity on the rise of the eastern hill; and...a tall
man coming round by the Town Hall corner.
Tall, spare, battered, depressed, his very eyes
lacking either speculation or apprehension—a sad,
a moody and embittered man. A poet? Yes;
Gordon, the poet. He has been interviewing his
publishers and has obtained “ a statement.”
Meets him another, short, spare also, slightly
-stooped, a gleam of mingled self-elation and
genuine camaraderie in his eyes. He is now too
well clad for the day. He i 3 Kendall, the other
poet. In his pocket he has proofs of the review he
, has been permitted to make of Gordon’s book for
The Australasian. Beyond all doubt, they were
the two most noteworthy men in Melbourne that
day, the two who had even then made for Aus-
tralia heritages inalienable and eternal. For us
and for all our children and children’s children, a
something which neither we nor they can ever sell
or mortgage or lose, unless self is first sold or
mortgaged or lost.
“Come and have a drink,” said Kendall, and
the two crossed over to the old ramshackle Argus
Hotel, which stood just below the old ramshackle
Argus offioe of those times. They entered in, and
the glass doors swung to behind them, shutting
out this world for one, and that one out from that
world for ever. It was Gordon’s last day.
J*
We can picture the two in the comfortable
shabby snuggery of the place, drinking occa-
sionally, and talking very much in earnest, as the
day waned and the many people came and went.
There is no record of the conversation. Kendall
did not at any time make an effort to record it,
which matters much, for assuredly it was all
literature. Apart from literature and the things
directly appertaining thereto, Gordon and Ken-
dall had not one square inch of common standing-
ground.
Many men looked in through the day who were
intimately known to both, but none intruded.
The proofs may have been between them for a
while, and later such kindling response from eye
to eye as would ward off all save intruding fools.
The day waned as they sat, the bitter, dull June
day ; and when they came into it again the twi-
light had cloaked the streets, and the discordant
rumble, clatter, and jangle of the evening’s home-
ward traffic tilled all the air. The stream of
people on the pavement was congenial to Gordon
as % brawling creek in a hungry country to a
weary, benighted traveller. He had been for a
little while on a puny crest of exultation;
he was down in the corresponding hollow
of depression—sordid cares, inherited despond-
encies, rash resolves often enough hinted
at, overwhelmed him. When he arrived at
Brighton the chill and the sob and the sibilant
invitation from the spumy lips of the sea were all
influences to be escaped from while possible. He
went inside his house and shut the door. He
opened that door once more only, for on the
morrow he succumbed—to what ? Drink ? Rub-
bish. Julian Tenison Woods—great philosopher
and white man—who knew Gordon well in the old
Mount Gambier days, says “he was never a
drinking man, never had any pleasure in the
company of hard or noisy drinkers.” And men
who knew him well in later days, J. J. Shillinglaw
and Dr. Pat Moloney amongst others, have placed
it on record that he oould not drink, did not care
for drink, “got no good of drink” (in the way
good drinkers understand the phrase).
What ailed him, then? Was he broken by dis-
appointment over his failure to establish his
rights to the Esselmont estates? Alexander
Sutherland tells us so on one page, though on
another he had declared that Gordon never
sickened on that occasion. And that previous
statement is true, for Gordon sickened of nothing
but his own hands and head, from the earliest
wild outbursts to the last grim tragedy. It was
not drink, it was disappointment. It was the
clinching of the curse ne inherited, the grip of
the Dead who possessed him, rendered possible
by circumstances over which, in the familiar but
here strictly accurate commonplace, he had no
control.
*
Adam Dunford Gordon married his own cousin,
Harriet Elizabeth Gordon; and from the mar-
riage came Adam Lindsay into the world, with
all the aberrations and consequent risky pros-
pects a physiologist might have foretold. But
worse, his mother, two years before his birth,
disclosed such signs of mental aberration as to
render special treatment necessary; and these
continued and increased till, in acute melancholia,
she died.
Adam Lindsay Gordon was thus conceived,
born and cradled in actual madness ; also within
limits of consanguinity on the part of his parents
which are not entered in that way without peril. Is
it possible to lay too much stress on such facts as
these ? Do they not justify the assertion that the
devil who tormented him his whole life long, and
ultimately slew him, was with him from his birth
and begetting and in him through all his up-
bringing ? Alexander Sutherland, in his inconse-
quential prosings, will not say so. Henry Gyles
Turner, in his offensive and often illiterate
patronage, would flout such an idea. But neither
the one nor the other of them helped ever towards
the understanding of a man whose ways seemed
always to be dictated by whims. Not much more
did they know of the actual characteristics of his
verse.
It was compulsory on Gordon that he should
attempt great things. It was also laid on him
that, in all great attempts, he should be hampered
and hindered; and in the end be called back in
such peremptory fashion as to brook no denial.
His wild riding, his lonely broodings, his sudden
graspings at anything offering resource, occupa-
tion, distraction, were not begotten of any desire
to escape from a reckless or shameful past. There
was a something in, on, and about him always.
The companionship which impelled him to un-
conventional deeds was not that of “ Black Tom
Oliver,” or any of his set. Read De la Motte
Eouque’s Sintram if you want to understand. If
that does not assist you, admit your own limita-
tions, take down Sutherland and Turner, and be
content.
Jt
Gordon’s loves were idyllic in their chastity.
H« was absolutely untainted by Corsair lusts. The
idea of wrong or dishonour to any woman re-
pelled him even in his youth. If he loved the
village maid, or the maid of the inn, it was
with a love that would place her at his side and
bind to her his homage for ever. This attitude of
mind always maintained enabled him in his very
best work to find an absolutely new track in a
very-well-beaten country That work is “The
Rhyme of Joyous Guard,” the true story of the
man Launcelot, whom Gordon introduces to com-
prehension and worthy esteem better than any
who went before him. Tennyson’s Launcelot,
after direst wrong to man and woman, king and
queen, does but repent as a monk. Gordon’s
Launcelot loves lustily, recklessly, and suffers
correspondingly. He cannot, in the time of the
avenging of his sin, muffle it in any cowl or
strangle it with any rosary, or pluck its sting
from his heart by any process whatever. Proper
natural agony of remorse wrings from him a great
and exceeding bitter cry—
If ever I smote as a man should, smite,
If I struck one stroke that seemed good in Thy sight,
By Thy loving mercy prevailing,
Lord ! let her stand in the light of Thy face,
Clothed with Thy love and crowned with Thy grace,
When I gnash my teeth in the terrible place
That is filled with -weeping and wailing.
The verse is not equal to the sentiment. Gordon
realised more there than he could express ; but I
think that to the nobly intolerant fierceness of
that sentiment in him a good deal of the real
strength of that fin® poem may be attributed.
My good blade carves the casques of men,
My tough lance thrusteth sure,
My strength is as the strength of ten
Because my heart is pure.
Pure in the virile, the manly, not the monkish
sense. In the absolute unalterable conviction that
to the woman he loves man must be absolutely
and eternally loyal and faithful; and that at need
he must face and endure hell to uphold her honour,
atone for her sin, or cloak her shame. More is
born out of that sort of mood than comes forth by
prayer and fasting even. And the agony of re-
morse is commensurate with the passion of fight.
I do not know where to seek elsewhere for such
realistic and flamboyant glorying in battle as is in
the “Joyous Guard.” How sharp is the contrast
between disci pie Peter’s abortive onset (suggestive
of Winkle’s incontinent assault on the small boy
in Pickwick) and the true man’s fighting way.
Not thus on the shattering visor jar?-ed,
In his hand the iron of the Kilt cross-barred,
When the blade was swalloived up to the guard
Through the teeth of the strong blasphemer.
And what of the wild delight of the mSlee, the
rapture of onset —
Then a steel-shod rush and a steel-clad ring,
And a crash of the spear staves splintering
In the billowy battle blended ;
Riot of chargers, revel of bloivs.
And fierce flushed faces of fighting foes,
From croup to bridle that reeled and rose
In a sparkle of sword-play splendid.
It is wonderful work, but not Australian.
Gordon at his best is never, or on one occasion
only, is Australian. “Britomarte,” very fit to be
bracketed with “Joyous Guard,” and infinitely
better from the literary craftsman’s standpoint,
is old-world all. Through it again, observe the
inspiration of the “love that never knew its
earthly close, ” nor had any earthly gratification,
and in it discover, if you may, about as good gal-
loping and fighting verse as the world wots of —
which is a bold saying, but true. Ido not think
any other horse whose hoof-beats sound through
Australian rhymes is fit to make “Britomarte”
extend herself.
In “ The Sick Stockrider” is voiced the best of
the inspiration Australia gave to the wandered,
obsessed, and suffering soul. But that, to those
who have breathed the breath of life of the con-
tinent, is “inside blackfellovv” work altogether.
Its philosophy is “ inside ” philosophy in the same
sense, and that tag which J. J. Snillinglaw “ re-
covered ” and the little literary coterie of Mel-
bourne approved, caps it very fitly.
Enigmas that perplex us in the world’s unequal
strife
The future may ignore or may reveal,
Yet some as weak as ivater, Ned, to make the best of
life
Have been to face the worst as true as steel.
Just so. But we do not choose to grapple Gordon
on to our hearts with stuff of that sort. Its value
is in its dismal harmony with the all-pervading
sentiment of the man’s life. He was bog-ridden
by such a sense of the inevitable as would hardly
permit him to laugh. He could ride, he could
fight, and not recklessly or brainlessly, as is very
commonly supposed now. *‘ A brainier man
never got across a horse,” said one of the eldest of
the old Ballarat riders. “ A ’cuter after hounds
never rode up the wind to keep the track of the
drag.” He was cool as the oldest fighter with the
gloves. But everything with him was to a finish.
Broken hand, cracked ribs, even a smashed
skull mattered nothing so long as be could get to
his feet and order, by any means, the impulses of
the tortured brain.
Pity he did not face Ballarat in the earliest of
his Australian days. The mounted-trooper life
in South Australia was the most sordid he ever
endured, and when he pitched it up for horse-
breaking down about Penola, it was to camp on
the outer fringe of whatever was heartening and
inspiring in the life of the time. There was, as
we know, good fighting in those days, but it was
Gordon’s bad luck never to get into the actual
fighting line. The muddling away of the belated
Eatrimony is not pleasant reading, nor yet the
usiness side of the Ballarat career. There was
not much joy in the bit of cottage by Lake
Wendonree ; and in the fierce and lusty devildom
which still hung about the digging town he had no
part. He would have been seen, at his best,
probably, at the Riddochs’ place, YsLllum, where
his wife stayed a good deal, and he visited
frequently; or at Herbert Power’s home at
Toorak later on. But the best was always shaded
with moroseness, the worst redeemed from any
touch of baseness by innate and cherished chivalry ;
and from sordidness even more detestable, by the
scant grace he had of his birth.
J*
Happiness to Gordon must, I think, have been
mostly in dreamland. Riding was always in grim
earnest for money, needed the moment it was
won. Like Keats, when out of the body he
radiated ’twixt extreme heights. The “ long white
plumes” would dance before his eyes, the virgin
choir would “ make delicious moan.” But all the
time round about him
The hills like giants at a hunting lay
Chin upon hand to see the game at bay.
And always he knew that to the dark tower he
should come at last. Podas Okus is good dream-
ing—
Lower yet, my own Briseis,
Denser shadows veil the light —
And how supremely good is the ending !
Pallas ! thus thy soldier comes !
Not thus did he approach that dark tower,
“blind as a fool’s heart,” of his own fate. It grew
on him down by the melancholy coast where at
night time seems the breadth of the outer sea, but
lifelessness therewith.
Drones a murmwr faintly splashing,
’Tis the splash of Charon’s oar.
After that long talk with Kendall and the
subsequent long journey in the chilly fore-night,
he felt the closing in, the snapping of the jaws of
the gin. The pinion of Apollyon’s bird had
touched him, the horrors strewn on the threshold
had appalled but could not repel him. Revela-
tion came, and imperative command and irre-
sistible impulse—
Burningly it came on him all at once,
I'here stood the dark tower blind as a fool s heart,
Without a counterpart in the whole world.
And yet
Dauntless the horn unto his lips he set
And blew—Childe Adam to the dark tower came.
Shall vve repeat it once again, the
Frater ave atque vale
of best beloved paganism ? And end thus the little
attempt at the recovery of what was actual and
true from much that has since been heaped up in
misapprehension, narrow-mindedness, literary
Eharisaism and conventional oommonplace with
is own verse—
With a flash that ends thy pain
Respite and oblivion blest
Come to greet thee.. lin vain
Fall; I rise to fall again :
Thou hast fallen to thy rest-
And thy fall is best.

MEMORANDA
Jack Cameron (brother of Mary Gilmore), a Westra-
lian journalist who went as war correspondent in South
Africa and is now employed in London, has written
A History of the Guerilla War in Cape Colony, soon to
be published in Dutch and English.
N.S.W. Legislative Assembly recently voted £m to
Roderic Quinn, for a year’s work in compiling widely,
distributed literary matter designed to advertise New
South Wales.
The proprietors of The Sydney Mail advertise
a prize of ATOO for the best tale, suitable for publication
in The Mail, reoeived before 30th June, 1904. Only resi-
dents in the Commonwealth may compete, Copyright
reverts to the author six months after serial publication
is completed.
An exhibition of some of Phil May’s English
drawings, including many contributed to Punch, was
announced to be held in London early in October. The
curious thing about the reprint of May’s Punch work that
has reached Australia since his death, is that (as a local
illustrator comments) many of the drawings “ do not look
like Phil May.” In a sense, and generally speaking, the
handling is improved as compared with the Australian
work: it is softer, more free,-better for illustration.
Bui it has lost a great deal of May’s peculiar
vivacity, vigour, individual charm. The London
work is at once stronger and weaker. And, as it is
stronger in the direction of subjective art—which was
not May'8 best point, and weaker in the direction of
objective art—the statement of line and mass, colour and
form, apart from illustrative meaning—where May was
pre-eminent, one is free to prefer a drawing like “A
Curiosity in Her Own Country ” (No. 384 of the Sydney
sale) to almost anything May did in England except the
“ Guttersnipes.”

Roimd Anvil Rock, by Nancy Huston Banks
(Lond., Macmillan ; 2s. 6 d.) [On« of the tribe of
anaemic American novels, moulded to the ideals of
Boston. A “ real elegant" romance of externals- with
the proper sentiment, and the preferred historical
reference, and the familiar insipidity.]
A Passage Perilous, by Rosa Nouchette Carey
(Lond., Macmillan ; 2s. 6<f.) [Here is a third-rate
Englishwoman’s novel in contrast with the preceding.
Rosa Nouchette comes of the homely stock ol Mrs.
Henry Wood. Her books are Mrs. Wood’s without the
spice of melodrama —the characters and incidents less
shrewdly gripped. They furnish good reading for the
disappearing domestic female. Compared with the
thin American culture-novel, they are much to be pre-
ferred. The English solidity is in them ; their conces-
sion to sentiment is based on honest instinct; and their
sincere commonplace is healthier and far more agree-
able than the high-flown artificiality found over the

.THERE’S NOTHING LIKE IT!
Caution!
DO not be induced to buy any
appliance purporting to be an
Electric Belt better than
McLaughlin’s. We warn the
public that these articles are being
offered by quacks and pretenders for a
few shillings as an inducement to get
the unwary to send for them in order
that they may try to sell their Drugs
as well.
Thousands of Pounds are wasted by
people who are falsely led to believe
that Imitation Belts are as good as the
Dr. McLaughlin
Electric Belt.
Vendors of these so-called Electric
Belts plagiarise and imitate our adver-
tisements on account of the wonderful
success and great cures we have made
all over the world.
Daily we receive complaints from
people who have got these articles and
who have been induced to undergo a
course of Drug Treatment as well,
which cost them from 20 to 50 guineas,
saying that they have received no
benefit from either the Belt or the
Drug Treatment.
Beware of Worthless
Imitations.
ALL FUNCTIONAL OR NERVOUS
DISORDERS CAN BE CURED WITH-
OUT THE AID OF DRUGS, AND
OURS IS THE ONLY ELECTRIC
APPLIANCE THAT WILL DO IT.
FOR the Weak, for the Nervous, for the Dyspeptic, or Constipated, for
the Wasted or Run-Down Man or Woman, it acts like magic. For
those in pain with Rheumatism, Sciatica, Lumbago, Indigo 3tion,
Weak Back, Kidneys, Varicocele, and all pains and aches, Electricity is
the only thing that will permanently cure. If your liver is out of order one or
two applications of the Belt will restore it to a proper working condition.
When you have done with Drugs send for a
Dr. McLaughlin Electric Belt
if you value Health and Strength ! If you seek Joy and Happiness! I
It replaces the Electricity in the body that has been wasted—the cause of most
ailments. It is the motive power that runs the human body, and sufferers
from any form of Functional or Nerve Diseases will find it the only cure.
Our vast experience for the past 25 years has proved this over and over
again by the thousands of cases that have been pronounced by the Doctors as
incurable that have been successfully treated by Electricity.
There is Nothing Like It to give you
Health, Strength and Vitality.
Mr. CHERM LEE, of NARROMINE, N.S.W.: “I am pleased to say I have derived great
benefit The Indigestion has entirely disappeared.”
Mr. HENRY WARREN, 2 LITTLE CORE STREET, FITZROY, VIC., writes: ”1 am glad to say
my health Is grand. The three months I have had it it has done for me what dootors never
could, i oan eat now like a horse, and have gained a stone in weight.”
Mr. WILLIAM COW, of ALBION PARK, N.S.W., writes: “I am pleased to state your high-
grade Belt has completely cured me of Sciatioa.”
Mr. <l. WATSON, of CLENAROWA, VIC., says: “I am still wearing your Belt with the same
good results. I oan now safely say I am better than I have ever been.”
Mr. S. C. FAIRLIE, SECOND VALLEY, S.A., speaks: “I have worn your Belt for 24 days,
and my health Is better. I feel fit and well.”
Mr. W. LEADBITTER, of CLARENCE TOWN, N.S.W., writes: “I must say your Belt is a
wonderful thing. I cannot see why people are so blind as not to see the virtue of ft. lam
satisfied it is better than all the drugs.”

Without
Operation,
Pain, Danger, Inconvenience, or Loss of Time. A genuine success. IMMEDIATE RELIEF.
The acme of comfort anrl a feeling of perfect confidence is secured from the first hour of using
Dr. Langston’s combined treatment. Write to-day for Treatise No. 12—posted 2 stamps—and
read the CONVINCING TESTIMONY received from all parts of Australia, from hundreds
of men who HAVE BEEN CURED. Used and endorsed by Clergymen, Statesmen, Lawyers,
Physicians, Farmers, Artisans, Navvies, Miners ; in fact, men and women in every station of
life. These living witnesses support facts that leave no room for doubt.
VARICOCELE
CURED—No Cutting or Pain.
The stagnant blood is driven from the dilated veins, and all soreness and swelling subsides.
Men suffering from Weakened Nerve Force, Constant Depression, Gloomy Forebodings, Fast
Becoming Unfitted for Active Business Life, fail to attribute their deplorable state to the
PROPER CAUSE. They know they have VARICOCELE, as they have suffered some dis-
comfort on account of it, particularly while standing. But the evil effects due to
VARICOCELE are so gradual that they neglect it until the entire system is undermined, and
they are forced to realise that something must be done to prevent them from breaking down
completely. To such sufferers I say, Don’t fall into the hands of Quacks —don’t submit
to the knife—don’t pay enormous sums to so-called specialists for medioines, electric belts, etc.
My perfect, simple device will CURE YOU EASILY, Permanently, and Quickly, without
inconvenience or loss of time. Send for Treatise No. 15—posted 2 stamps.

Various Verses.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
By the Sea.
Have you heard the snowy wave-lips whisper
Their wondrous legends on the yellow sands ?
And have you felt how roaming winds blow crisper
There, where the seas and lands
Lie breast to breast, with inter-twining hands?
Have you seen the white spray-fountains springing
When the waves meet the sculptured, glistening
rocks ?
And have you seen the long, brown sea-weeds
clinging
In festoons and in looks,
And firmest where the wave most rudely shocks ?
Turn from the opulent might of seething tides
To mermaid-pools, prisoned in rocky sides :
Stars of a bright vermilion,
And stars of a living brown;
Bright sea-flowers in the weedy bowers,
Floating sceptre and crown ;
Spine-girded globes and discs star-rayed—
And where was the plan of the marvels made ?
Shells of a Tyrian purple,
And shells of iris dyes ;
Shells of the pearl and the rose’s furl,
And shells of the summer skies;
Scallop and whorl, volute and fan—
And where is the wonderful artizan ?
Turn from the magic mermaid-pools ; and dream
What wealth of beauty hides in ocean’s gleam !

Athirst.
Dear, never think those days of passion ended
With waving hands and widening stretch of sea;
Still in my heart is fiercest longing blended
With far, faint hope; how is it, dear, with thee?
I am not false to thee, nor have bereft thee
Of one swift thought; my soul is still thy slave !
I have but sought to ’suage the thirst you left me
All unappeased, though wealth of love you gave.
There have been other arms as soft and clinging
Since those mad days when Heaven and Hell
were one ;
And other lips have love’s sweet song been
singing:
Art thou, O love of mine, content with none ?
Nay! I know well! Of all sweet women living,
Of all the passion-lipped of days gone by,
Thou, whose great love but greater grows in
giving,
O, perfect flower of flame, must love or die.

Love’s Defeat.
Love stood suppliant at the gate
Where Beauty’s face was smiling;
And even while he bent his bow,
With tender words beguiling,
His bright wings hid the cunning dart
He fain would fix in Beauty’s heart.
“ Come hither, sweet,” said jealous Love,
“ My golden bow is harmless,
And youth that lacks my kiss,” said he,
“ I trow were sad and charmless.”
But still the maid, with feigning coy,
Disdainful, mocked the ardent boy.
“ Beware, sweet maid,” he whispered oft,
“ Perchance, if thou defy me,
The wine of life shall lose its glow,
And joy for ever fly thee.”
"Nay, pretty Love,” she smiling, said,
“ The days of old romance are dead.”
While still Love pleaded, sore at heart,
In words fond, wise, and burning,
A mighty lord rode proudly by,
His mien Love’s armor spurning;
And even while he woo’d the maid
Poor Cupid saw her coyness fade.
“ My name is Gold,” the gallant said,
All bold to Beauty pleading.
She laid her hands within his own,
Love’s offer all unheeding.
He turned in triumph : “ Fool ! ” quoth he,
“ To dream that you could cope with me.”
Poor Love went sadly from the gate
When Beauty so betrayed him,
And down among the summer grass
In musing sorrow laid him.
“Life is an empty jest,” he sighed,
. “ When hearts with gold are satisfied.”

The Bose Lovers.
I gave her a rose in early June,
Fed with the sun and dew;
Each petal, I said, is a note in the tune,
The rose is the whole tune through and through.
The tune is the whole red-hearted rose,
Flush and form, honey and hue,
Lull with the cadence, and throb to the close,
I love you, I love you, I love you.
She gave me a rose in early June,
Fed with the sun and dew;
Each petal, she said, is a mount in the moon,
The rose is the whole moon through and through.
The moon is the whole pale-hearted rose,
Bound and radiance, burnish and blue,
Break in the flood-tide that murmurs and flows,
I love you, I love you, I love you.
This is our love in early June,
Fed with the sun and dew,
Moonlight and roses hid in a tune ;
The roses are music through and through.
The moonlight falls in the breath of the rose.
Light and cadence, honey and hue,
Mingle, and murmur, and flow to the close,
I love you, I love you, I love you.

SCALP AND lAR
Something for Mothers to Think About
EVERY CHILD bom into the world with an inherited
or early developed tendency to distressing, disfiguring
humours of the skin, scalp, and blood, becomes an object
of the most tender solicitude, not only because of its suf-
fering but because of the dreadful fear that the disfigura-
tion is to be lifelong and mar its future happiness and
prosperity. Hence it becomes the duty of mothers of
such afflicted children to acquaint themselves with the
best, the purest, and most effective treatment available,
viz., THE CUTICURA TREATMENT.
Warm baths with Cuticura Soap, to cleanse the skin of crusts and scales
and soften the thickened cuticle, gentle anointings with Cuticura Oint-
ment, to instantly allay itching, irritation, and inflammation, and soothe and
heal, to be followed in the severer cases by mild doses of Cuticura Resol-
vent Pills (see below), to cool and cleanse the blood, are all that can be
desired for the alleviation of the suffering of skin-tortured infants and
children and the comfort of worn-out, worried mothers. A single set is
often sufficient to cure when the best physicians fail.
Millions of Women Use Cuticura Soap
Assisted by Coticura Ointment, for preserving, nurifving, and beautifying the skin, for
cleansing the scalp of crusts, scales, and dandruff, and the stopping of falling hair, for
softening, whitening, and soothing red, rough, and sore hands, for baby rashes, itchings,
and chaflngs, in the form of baths for annoying irritations and inflammations, or too free
or offensive perspiration, in the form of washes for ulcerative weaknesses, and for many
sanative, antiseptic purposes which readily suggest themselves to women, especially
mothers, and for all the purposes of the toilet, bath, and nursery,
Cuticura Resolvent Pills (Chocolate Coated) are prepared to meet the wants of
delicate women, and sensitive children, and are pure, sweet, and tasteless. They are
beyond question the most successful blood purifiers and humour cures yet compounded.

Acute Dyspepsia.
“Clements Tonic Restored
all my Strength and Vigor.”
The Case of tyre. R. WATKINS.
(by our reporter.)
Thers is a period in every person’s life,
particularly when in sorrow, that the sym-
pathy of a friend in need is greatly appre-
ciated, and although it is difficult to con-
jecture how many hearts may be gladdened
by the news appearing below, it is safe to
remark that Mrs Rachael Watkins, of
Grosvenor-street, Woollahra, was actuated
by the best of motives in saying :
“ My health was in such an unsatisfac-
tory state some time ago that I could not
enjoy life. Every day I gut up with a
splitting headache which made me feel sad
and wretched from morning till night, and,
owing to the taste I had, I felt so sick that
I could not touch any breakfast. My tongue
was dry and my throat was so parched that
I was constantly drinking water, yet the
thirst from which I suffered still remained.
Sometimes midday went by and still I did
not feel hungry, but as sure as I did take a
little food I paid dearly for it afterwards.”
“In what way, Mrs. Watkins ? ” enquired
the pressman.
“I used to feel ill all over me, especially
if there happened to be a little salt in my
food, which had the effect of making my
mouth and throat so much inflamed that it
was painful for me to swallow anything;
but the stomach seemed to be the worst
part, as it was distended with wind
which came from the food which had not
digested, and the cramping pains inside
were simply horrible. Windy spasms often
caused me to get up in the middle of the
night and walk the floor in agony, for it
was more than I could do to lie there quietly
and suffer such frightful torture. What-
ever I had eaten always repeated, but it
would not come up, much as I would have
liked it to, as then I would have felt a
little easier.”
“ How long had yon Suffered in this
way ? ”
“I was very ill for twelve -months.
Everything went wrong, even my chest
being painful with a heavy sensation which
almost stifled me. Many a time I tried to
vomit, thinking that if I could only do so I
would be much relieved, but the lump in
my chest seemed to be a fixture, and fre-
quently made me feel as if I were taking
my last breath, the trouble in breathing
was so great. I became so terrified that I
might suffocate whilst in bed that I used to
prop myself up with pillows, and, notwith-
standing the fact that I always felt weak
and worn out, I could not sleep when I did
retire, being very restless till about two or
three o’clock in the morning. When I
ought to have been asleep was the only
part of the twenty-four hours that I seemed
to liven up a bit, but it was very unnatural
for me to be so fidgety, and my system was
drained of all its vital force on that account.
If I did fall asleep I began dreaming, and
when I woke up I tried to recollect what I
had been dreaming about, but my memory
was so defective that I could not recall any-
thing t® mind. Scarcely an hour passed
without some annoyance being caused by
sharp pains between my shoulders, and es-
pecially under my left shoulder-blade, and
my legs ached so much that after standing a
little while the aches developed into dis-
tinct pains. Across my loins the aches
were really terrible. I used to think they
came through sitting down so much, but I
found when I walked the pains were still
more severe. The least effort on my part
resulted in giddiness coming on, sol had to
be very careful how I went about, particu-
larly as my eyes were often so affected that
I could scarcely see out of them. If I
stooped to pick up anything from the floor
I felt half-dazed for a while, my head reel-
ing awfully, and small black specks dancing
all round. Not only did I lose all my
strength, but my nervous system was quite
unstrung.”
“I believe you consulted a doctor, Mrs.
Watkins. W hat did he say your complaint
teas ? ”
“My doctor said I was suffering from
acute indigestion, and he treated me accord-
ingly, but to my intense dismay I could
see I had no hope of recovering under his
treatment, as the medicines he prescribed
did not have any good effect. In my sor-
rowful condition I lost heart completely. I
did not know what to do, especially as I had
got so much more feeble that on many oc-
casions I had to lie down in a state of ex-
haustion the whole of the day. It looked
to me as though my remaining days were
to be spent in misery, from which there was
no escape; but I thought I ought to try
everything at my disposal, so I started doc-
toring myself with advertised medicines,
and when I had taken enough of them to
base an opinion upon, I was forced to con-
clude that my afflictions were incurable.
As those medicines were also useless I
thought, in my desperation, that everything
else was the same, but a lady friend spoke
so favourably about Clements Tonic that I
could not help buying some.”
“ Did you find it acting as your friend
said it would ? ”
“Yes, thank God! her advice was not
misleading, for Clements Tonie had precisely
the effect which I was told it would have,
although my condition was so low that it
took a little time to make headway. Once
Clements Tonic got my maladies on the
move, however, it shifted them with great
despatch. I started by picking up my ap-
petite and getting an occasional sound
night’s rest; then, when my head was free
from pain, I slept tranquilly right through
every night, and the aches left my limbs by
degrees. I considered this a great amount
of success for Clements Tonic to achieve,
taking into account the repeated failures I
had met with, so I got more of it as it was
required, and I shall never regret that I
stuck steadfastly to the same remedy, to
which there was nothing to compare for so
restoring my internal organs to a healthy
state that my food digested properly. My
vision became clear, the distention of and
pains in my stomach did not occur again,
and the stifling sensations left my chest.
To put it briefly, I was relieved of every
pain which had made my life a martyrdom,
besides having my nervousness quite
abolished, and you may depend I was de-
voutly thankful to Clements Tonic for bring-
ing back all my strength and vigor. In
every respect I was like a new woman, for
I had suffered from rheumatism close on
five years, and Clements Tonic was the only
medicine which gave me relief. My feet
and nearly all the joints in my body had
been assailed by severe rheumatic pains, but
Clements Tonic found its way to those parts
and gradually diminished my tortures. In
all cases of sickness I recommend to my
friends the use of Clements Tonic, and you
may publish these remarks in any way you
desire.”

Wore a Torture
BELT.
SUFFERED TERRIBLE AGONY.
From wearing an Electric Belt
charged by the use of
SULPHURIG TIG ID.
Mr. W. Folley, Alfred Woollen Mills,
Williamstown, Vic., writing to the Dr.
McLaughlin Electric Belt Co., tells how he
was scarred and burned by the use of a
FPee Belt, which he had erroneously
been led to believe was as good as theirs.
He paid £\ for the Free Belt because
, he had been convinced that by paying
this cash price he was obtaining a similar
appliance to Dr. McLaughlin’s Famous
rejuvenator which has gained World
Wide fame as a Curative Agent. It goes
to show how misleading are advertise-
ments which seem to offer something for
nothing.
Gentlemen —In answer to your kind in-
quiries after my health, I beg to state that
I have been completely cured of the Scia-
tica that has troubled me for years. I
cannot thank you enough for your gentle-
manly treatment and fair dealing with your
patient 9, as I know from others that their
treatment has been the same as mine.
I may just as well let you know my ex-
perience in seeking a cure for my trouble
before I purchased one of your High Grade
Belts. I had been under doctors and re-
ceived scant relief; and also tried various
quacks, but it was all the same. I then
placed myself in the hands of a Specialist
(in Melbourne) guaranteed to cure Rheu-
matism and Sciatica, but received very
small benefit from the treatment. I then
had my attention drawn to Electricity.
Well, I thought, “ Never venture, never
win,” so I PROCURED first of all a Belt
for £l and was very much disappointed
because I was informed that it was neces-
sary to take a long and exceedingly ex-
pensive course of drug treatment. I would
not do this and then I wrote for, and ob-
tained a so-called FPee Belt, with a
most “ Wonderful Pedigree,” at a cost of
M- i wore the Belt according to the in-
structions given faithfully for a period of
five weeks, and by that time I was Burnt
and Blistered so badly that I could not
wear it longer, and still no relief was
gained, although the Belt was guaranteed
to Cure Anything in Sciatica in One
Month. You bet I was very much dis-
couraged in regard to Electric Belts.
However, I was persuaded to come and
just see you, gentlemen. I then found
that I had been wearing a Torture Belt
and very Wrongly Applied, and quite
enough to give and patient a Horror of
so-called Electric Belts. After the con-
sultation I decided to place myself in your
hands. I knew my case was very diffi-
cult, as I was compelled to follow my em-
ployment, and standing at the vice was
irksome, and the complaint was a very
stubborn one. However, gentlemen, your
Belt, coupled with your advice, has made
me a grateful patient. I thank you kindly
for supplying me with a remedy which has
Completely Cured Me, and strongly recom-
mend it to all and sundry that I find are
suffering from the distressing malady
called “ Sciatica.”
I have not been wearing the Belt for the
past fortnight, but have passed it over to
my wife, who has received great benefit
for nervous troubles.
I remain, your grateful patient,

“London, Tuesday.— A cartoon showing the Princess Louise’s
design for a bronze memorial is now on exhibition in St. Paul’s
Cathedral. The design shows an angel with outstretched wings lean-
ing tenderly over a figure of the crucified Redeemer. It is intended
for a tablet commemorating the deeds of the colonial sons of the
Empire in the late war.”
“ London, 20th October.—Mr. Cresswell was examined yesterday
before the Rand Native Labor Commission. He stated that the chair-
man of the London directorate of his company had written to him
privately to the effect that Messrs. Wernher, Beit and Co. and other
Rand mining magnates had been consulted on the question of employ-
ing unskilled white labor, and that they were adverse. They feared
that the engaging of a large number of white laborers on the Rand
would ‘ cause the same troubles as had prevailed in Australia,’ and
would enable a combination of labor to dictate the rates of wages,
and to dictate also politically when responsible government came to
be established in the Transvaal.”

Wanted-a Freetrade Party which
Doesn’t Find its Own Gospel Too
Obscene for Daily Use.
New South Wales was, for many years, the one
alleged Freetrade State in Australasia, and the
solitary beacon of Cobdenism in a dark continent,
and it is claimed that it is still in the beacon busi-
ness, more or less, though the light is obscured by
extraneous circumstances. In the bygone years it
had every kind of Freetrade politician—except
the one who practised Freetrade. It had Free-
trade politicians who shouted about the beauties
of Freetrade and the accursedness and obvious
folly of Protection ; it had many lying Freetrade
politicians who said they practised Freetrade
when they knew they didn’t; it had Freetrade
politicians who didn’t get their hair cut, who bor-
rowed half-sovereigns, who were deficient in edu-
cation, who wrote alleged poetry, who dealt in
shady land transactions—in fact, it had every
possible Freetrade politician, except the one who
had enough faith in his own exploded creed to put
it into practice. Their unanimity in the matter
of avoiding their own blessed political remedy was
the most unanimous thing the country has ever
seen - *
Twelve years ago, in 1891, the great Freetrade
epoch of Henry Parkes came to an end. His
Government included those highly-superior
scoffers at Protection, M'Millan, Bruce Smith,
Joey Oarruthers. Gould, Pa Brunkeb, Sydney
Smith, and James Henry Young—all dodderers
of great size whose elevated snort of pity at persons
who believed in Protection was so superior that
they might have been a drove of emperors or an
association of brass gods. And this was the
tariff which they supplied to N.S.W. :
M'Millan and Sydney Smith Protective Tariff

After M ‘Millan and the two Smiths and
Young and Pa Brunker and the rest of the
superior and conscientious Freetraders who pro-
tected 43 N.S.W. industries had dropped out, the
State had a period of definite and honest, though
insufficient Protection, under the Dibbs Govern-
ment. The Dibbs Government wasn’t so very
much more protective than the Pumpkin Smith-
Bruoe Smith-M‘Millan Government, but it
didn’t lie about it, and the rooster of reproach
didn’t crow on its fence to remind it that it was a
traitor to its principles. Then followed the
alleged Freetrade Government of Reid, Sydney
Smith, Joe Cook, Pa Brunker, and other strange
characters, which was even more astonished than
the old M'MiLLAN push that anyone could believe
in so outlandish a thing as Protection, and which
pitied Protectionists with so wild and lofty a sniff
that it might have been a herd of archangels.
This was its tariff :
Reid and Sydney Smith and Joe Cook Tariff
(up to 1901).

The Bulletin goes back to this subject (and
will probably keep going back to it for some time)
because it involves a question which badly needs
to be answered, yet as regards which it seems as
if dynamite wouldn’t blow a reply out of a single
Freetrade politician. Reid and the two Smiths,
and Joe Cook and Conroy are all prepared to
hold forth for three hours at a stretch about every
question except this one, which is the most
important of all; as regards it, their silence is
such that the grave is pandemonium by compari-
son. So that there may be no mistake, the situa-
tson is here categorically set forth once more :
(1) Any and every politician, paper or person who cir-
culates the hackneyed tale about the relative progress of
N.S.W. under Freetrade as compared with Victoria and
other places under Protection is a liar, and knows he is
one ; for N.S.W. never had Freetrade. Being a liar, he
may settle with his own conscience the question whether
he is a gentleman or not.
(2) Every Freetrade politician who has held office in
N.S.W. has practised Protection of set purpose. He was
not driven to it by revenue necessities ; instead he lost
revenue by it. By raising the excise on local beer, wine,
tobacco, cigars, and sugar, for instance, to the level of
the import duties, the essential feature of Freetrade
(complete freedom of competition and complete absence
of Protection) could have been secured along with an
increase of revenue. The party which paid away a lot of
money for the privilege of being a traitor is something
unique.
(3) These Freetrade politicians either lied when they
said they believed cordially in Freetrade as the best
policy to promote the interests of the country, or they
deliberately tried to injure the country. In the latter
case the subsidiary question arises whether they were
hired by Paul Kruger or by some other violent outside
person.
• * * *
That is the situation as regards the past. The
past is dead, but its bones still hang around in an
unpleasant sort of way. With regard to the
present and future these bones have a large
significance. The alleged Freetraders, who now
ask to be put in charge of the destinies of
Australia, are the same men who did
this unexampled fraud and treason in the
past. And they propose to do exactly
the same fraud and treason in the future.
Among all the crowd of political bounders who
insult the intelligence of Australia with the
assurance that Freetrade is an axiomatic truth,
and the only way to commercial salvation, there
is not one who promises to try Freetrade when he
gets into power. There isn’t one who doesn’t
shudder at the idea of his callous gospel in actual
practice. Not one person in the whole bunch is
prepared to advocate that every import duty
which is necessary for revenue purposes shall be
counterbalanced by an exactly equal excise duty,
that postage and railway rates on Australian
papers shall be the same as on imported ones,
that railway and wharfage rates on local produce
shall be the same as on foreign produce, that all
public contracts shall be given to the cheapest
tenderer in fact, that Protection shall be
utterly abolished. The Freetrader says that
his gospel 13 the only one that can make
the country great and prosperous, that he
flatly declines to make the country great
and prosperous, that Protection is utterly
disastrous, that he will practise a certain amount
of the disastrous policy if he gets into power, that
Protectionists are fools, and that lie proposes to
borrow a good part of the fools’ policy; and that
kind of Freetrader is an undesirable person. Yet
he is the only kind Australia seems to have.
• • • *
The question has been asked why Protectionists
should object so much to the clan of Reid, and
Bruce Smith, and Bruce Smith’s little brother
Pumpkin, and Joe Cook, and the rest, seeing that
they are prepared to give so much Protection in
practice, however much they denounce it in
theory. But the Australian Protectionist, unlike
the Australian Freetrader, has some reverence for
his political faith. He doesn’t want to see it
mauled in the dirty hands of renegades; he doesn’t
want to see monkeys drinking out of his com-
munion cup and apes gambolling in his tabernacle.
‘ He wants the ape to go and gambol in his own
tabernacle. If Protection is good enough to be
practised even in a small degree, it is also good
enough to be preached. If the Freetrade party
is willing to give the country Freetrade, then it
has as much right to office as any other party,
and is as honest as any other party, and The
Bulletin will treat it with respect accordingly.
As matters stand, and judged by its past record,
it is outside the pale of honest dealing, and the
laws which apply to other parties don’t apply to
it. So far, it hasn’t been a party in the customary
sense of the term, but a crowd of political spielers
living on the most impudent confidence trick ol
the generation.
The Australian Political Position.
There is no sure light ahead in Australian politics
yet. Mr. Reid, on behalf of the Opposition, has
exhibited his skill in ground and lofty tumbling,
feats of legerdemain, and lightning-change turns,
at 2s. per head, in various Victorian towns and
hamlets. The Labor party has issued a well-
thought-out and moderate manifesto, summarising
its work during the past Parliament—most of it
excellent, some of it mistaken. Premier Deakin
has spoken at Ballarat, and devoted his energy
mainly to being eloquent. “ Eloquence in a
public man is often, like beauty in a poor woman,
a fatal gift. Charmed with his own faculty of
uprearing lofty edifices of well-polished words,
with bright stained-glass trimmings, the elo-
quent politician is, in time, almost necessarily
obsessed with the notion that it is the
form and not the substance which is im-
portant in pronouncements on public policy;
that what is said is not of so much account as how
it is said. Such is a foolish notion to get into the
head of a public man in any country ; in Australia
it is particularly foolish, because in no country m
the world is there less real sympathy with eloquent
high-faluting. The Australian is inclined to be
somewhat cynical, a good deal matter-of-fact, and
very little inclined to give reverence to sonorous
periods and lofty flights of sentences. His typical
word for eloquence is “ gab,’’ and for any gifts of
language outside of those appropriate to the
bullocky he has, if not contempt, mere amused
toleration. Plain statements or plain issues
put directly, and—if that is the gift of
the speaker—with some wit, appeal to hint
best. But almost the whole stock-in-trade of
Premier Deakin is his eloquence and his lady-
like manner. He would as soon be seen in public
with a plain unvarnished statement as with a
straw hat over a frock coat. It was to have been
expected then, as the event proved, that his
Ballarat speech would be highly ornamental, and
not very useful in the direction of indicating a
straightforward and resolute party programme.
Alb red Deakin is not the man to plod along a
dusty road to the attainment of an arduous duty ;
he would sooner sit down by the wayside and
moralise. It is pretty moralising, and Mr.
Deakin makes a pretty figure as he speaks ; and
that’s the end of it. The Commonwealth still
lacks a policy for its next Parliament.
* * * *
Without any sure beacon ahead, there are one
or two points of guidance. George Reid’s plat-
form (which is, of course, not necessarily any
indication of his real views), as so far announced,
puts him out of serious consideration. All that
he proposes is to go back on the past, and, with a
mutilating hand, hack at the good work already
accomplished by the Federal Parliament. He
would break with the White Australia principle
by amending the Postal Act so as to allow Aus-
tralian money to go in subsidy of lascar-employing
capitalists, and Australian coastal shipping to be
subjected to the competition of black-labor boats,
and by withdrawing the encouragement which Aus-
tralia now gives to the Boy of the Bulldog Breed.
He would so change the tariff as to greatly reduce
its Protective incidence in order to serve his
calico friends. As regards the preferential trade
issue, he professes to be in favor of allowing
to British imports a 50 per cent, tariff concession,
which would certainly destroy the revenue sol-
vency of Australia. With all this destruction-
destruction of the White Australia policy, of the
measure of Protection existing, and of the finan-
cial basis of the Commonwealth —Mr. Reid pro-
poses nothing constructive. Clearly he and his
following should be, as far as possible, swept away
at the general elections. The fact that if Mr.
Reid is returned and finds it convenient to do so,
he will turn completely around and be as Protec-
tionist as Mr. Kingston, and as radical as Mr.
Watson, doesn’t affect the validity of this argu-
ment. Mr. Reid is in the position of a fox with
a brand to his tail being driven into the harvest-
fields of the Commonwealth by his master, the
foreign importer. His own secret views may not
be in sympathy with the work of destruction,
and, being a wily fellow, he may be able to
elude his drivers and take up a more comfortable
and less dangerous role. But Australia can take
no risks. Mr. Reid’s present platform is purely
destructive, and the destruction of the Reid
following is one absolutely sure and certain duty
of the electors in December.
* » * *
The Labor party has, on the whole, the best
record of the past Parliament, and from it is to
be reasonably expected the best programme for
the coming one. It has, by its insistence on a
white Australia; by its opposition to the fetters
of Imperialism; by its sturdy and successful
stand against inoculating the Commonwealth with
the borrowing virus; by taking a thoroughly
Australian attitude on questions of defence
—made itself more truly representative of
the Australian democracy than any other
of the party organisations. In some respects, it
has failed. It has not yet, for instance, learned
that the necessary complement of fair-wage con-
ditions in Australia is high Protection, since,
while the products of sweated labor can enter our
ports and compete in our markets, the home
worker must either sweat or go workless. The
Labor party is made up mostly of Protectionists,
but has a few members of foreign-trade views, and,
as a concession to them, “sinks the fiscal issue.”
That, and practically that alone, prevents it from
being accepted as a _ truly national party,
but does not prevent it, in the present lack
of such a party, having, on the whole, the best
claim to the electors’ confidence. The party which,
in addition to “fiscal peace,” promises a_ devo-
tion to Australian as against crazy-imperial ideals,
is the one best deserving of support.
• • * *
The Deakin following cannot be deprived of
the credit of having co-opBrated with the Labor
party in securing a White Australia and the other
sterling national reforms of the last Parliament.
It has, in the past, gone a long way on the path
to securing a prosperous, a free and a White
Australia. Now, however, it lacks a future rather
than a past. Mr. Deakin is eloquent on what
has been done, but very silent as to what is to be
done. He aspires to be a beautiful note of
admiration for a space of three years. And
the call is for something more progressive.
On only one question, preferential trade,
does he propose anything definite. His idea
of increasing the present duties against the
foreigner, whilst leaving them as they are against
British goods, is undoubtedly the best method, if
preference is decided on at all—a question which
cannot be resolved until Britain has made its
choice between Freetrade and Protection. Further
than that, Premier Deakin does not go in affirma-
tive policy. He does not propose to improve the
preßant tariff, though he knows that it needs im-
provement. He says nothing at all about the
financial issue—whether he intends to be a borrow-
ing Premier, or a Premier who lets public works
go to ruin, or an honest Premier who does
neither, but regards the Australian as a
possibly self-reliant and self respecting person
who can build his post office out of bis
own pocket. He is silent, too, on the issue
of the progress, or otherwise, of the Federal
idea, and makes no suggestion as to the increase
of the power of the Australian Parliament. VV hat-
ever indication lie gives regarding his attitude as
between the State-frights party and the Australian
party is discouraging ; on the issue of the Arbitra-
tion Bill he will be just as much the creature of
Irvine as was his predecessor, Barton, and will
refuse to bring State Government employees
under its provisions. To practically all the
questions put to Mr. Deakin by The Bulletin
last week, he was either silent or gave an
unsatisfactory reply. National Australians can
hardly follow him now with any consistency. So
far as he has gone, he is mostly right, but then he
proposes to go no further forward, but some dis-
tance backward. And with an absolutely demo-
cratic franchise and a Legislature entirely repre-
sentative of the people, with no Chamber of mere
obesity and no block property-vote to hinder its
work, there is no reason why Australia should not
go a great deal further.
As a moderate and reasonable programme for
the forthcoming session, The Bulletin would
propose
An Industrial Arbitration Bill embracing all workers,
so far as the Constitution allows ; a very firm attitude
towards Irvine or any other small State Premier who
ventures to make remarks on the subject. Federal old
age pensions. An intimation to all the State Govern-
ments that the Commonwealth is anxious to take over
the whole subject of industrial legislation.
Federalising of the State debts. An absolute prohibi-
tion of further borrowing, except for renewal or conver-
sion of old loans.
Federal land tax— progressive as regards large estates,
extra progressive as regards absentees. A Federal income
tax on absentees.
The strengthening of the system of Protection, as
regards at least one branch of industry—say the iron
industry—so as to wholly substitute Australian manu-
factures for imports.
The settlement of the Federal capital on a nationalised
area of at least 1000 (and, if possible, 5000) square miles,
where a Federal port is available. The appointment of a
democratic and able High Commissioner.
There are many other matters of pressing im-
portance which might be settled by a really strong
Premier within the space of the next Parlia-
ment. But this programme is put forward as
a moderate “ instalment ” one. Unfortunately it
is apparent that Premier Deakin is not the. man
to adopt it, since that would mean doffing his fine
frock-coat, and putting his silk ha,t in the dust, and
forgetting his eloquence, and feeling, if not speak-
ing, “bullocky.” It is impossible to imagine Premier
Deakin saying “damn ” publicly; and that is a
mournful thing to say of a man who wishes to lead
in affairs of state. There is a leader capable of
taking up and forcing through such a programme—
Kingston, and the best hope for Australian
democracy is that the electors will return enough
men of his mind to, with the help of the Labor
party, put him in power. The next best hope is
that the Kingston party and the Labor party will
be, if not strong enough to hold office, at least
strong enough to push Premier Deakin along.
Deakin has no great power of motion of his own,
but he would probably progress if pushed firmly.
The Sound of Freedom’s Song.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I loved it well —the sound of Freedom’s song
That rang in every pulse’s joyful beating;
I felt a sunlit Day would dawn ere long
For every downcast serf of Adam’s throng;
I felt Man yet would hail with proudest greeting
The sound of Freedom’s Song !
I love it still —dear Freedom’s sacred name !
Though one by one I see the weak surrender,
Altho’ her one-time champions do her shame
And desecrate the altars of her flame,
I cherish yet with rev’rence deep and tender
Dear Freedom’s sacred name !
I love it yet—the sound of Freedom’s song!
I hear her song for aye —the deathless siren
Of coming days that drive the Powers of Wrong,
Of strenuous years that come, serene and strong,
To help us burst our serf-enchained environ !
The sound of Freedom’s Song !
Q.
P.I.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Bill Lyne Makes Concessions.
The Bulletin, in the name of public honesty,
demands of Premier Deakin an explanation of
this item published in the daily press, and not, so
far, corrected: —
Definite action has at last been taken by Mr. Ltnb to
abolish the rule laid down by Mr. Kingston that all per-
sons guilty of breaches of the Customs Act, «hetner
innocently or fraudulently, should be haled before t
police-court. To-day he approved of regulations to em-
power the collectors of customs in the seieral States to
investigate certain charges laid under the provisions o
the Customs Act. The Minister stated that the cases
that the collectors would deal with would be those 1
which there was no suspicion of fraud. If fraud was ala-
closed during investigation, there would be P?*'® r J; "
once remit the case to the police-court when jt t
simple mistake had been made, the Minister add
the recommendation of the collector in each case 1
be forwarded to him, and he (the Minister) would dete -
mine the extent of the punishment.
If Premier Deakin doesn’t come forward with an
explanation, it must be concluded that he assent?
to this announcement by Mr. Lyne. In that case,
he must plead guilty either to—
(1) Deliberately reversing the honest poKcyof an'w-
colleague, and thereby making room for dishonesty and
Ch (2) a c e rueily unjustly maligninsr the character and
administration of an ex-colleague in order to pander to
dishonest section of the community.
The Customs policy of Kingston was not only
iust, but it was merciful. In June, 19w, 1 _
Sydney daily papers, which had been “H 1 *
otherwise, were challenged by Mr. Kingst -
come along and investigate for themael es
working of his department as regards prosecu-
tions. He did not ask for an inquiry .
facts by a judicial body; he t i, em .
accusers to come and get the facts
selves, and twist them, if they couid, mtoa jmh
fication of their accusations. The change -
accepted, and Sydney Telegraph the
result of its investigations (a full statement t
which was reprinted in The Bulletin 20, Mo!.
The investigation showed that from J J,’
to May 31, 1903, in N.S.W. there were detected
586 cases of errors in invoices and there were Jl
89 prosecutions; in the other 49/ ,
offenders were given the benefit of the dou


treated as honest but mistaken folk. Of the 89
prosecutions only six failed —the courts upheld 83
of them. The 586 offences under the Customs
Act were classed under various headings. In the
first heading (which was the only one under which
“ honest error” was obviously a reasonable plea)
there were 164 cases and no prosecutions. Under
only one heading, that of importing prohibited
goods (such as vile obscenities) were there
more than 25 per cent, of prosecutions. The
return showed clearly that Kingston’s adminis-
tration had not been harsh; that it had allowed
the maximum of mercy, consistent with justice.
Any modification, then, of his system must mean
injustice and concessions to dishonesty. Either,
therefore, Minister Lyne means to conduct the
Customs on a system less than honest, or, for pur-
poses of pandering to the importing interest,
represents that Kingston’s previous honest
administration was tyrannical and unfair and is to
be modified, though intending all the while not to
depart from it. Which horn of the dilemma does
Lyne chose to be impaled upon ? And is Premier
Deakin content to be in the same pillory ?
♦
The Loan Mental Disease.
An interesting example of a gallant effort to sup-
port a very hopeless case is the reply of the
TvjavxT* r^'HK Bulletin’s strictures on the
£i •i * kabor Party for its subservience to the
helpless, drifting, squandering See-Owe’Sullivan
Government:—
There is one general excuse to be made for the Labor
Party’s support of an extravagant Government—it was
necessar3' in the great national crisis through which we
have at length happily passed that something should be
done to stave off a national calamity. Only three courses
were open to the Government: (1) To let the poor and
workless starve ; (2) To feed the poor and workless on
the bread of charity ; (3) To find work with borrowed
money for the poor and workless. Therecan he no doubt
but what if this were put as a hypothetical case to The
Bulletin, or to any other of the Labor Party’s denouncers,
they would be compelled wholly to admit that the third
course was the only wise one. Now that was the one
taken by the See Government, with the Labor Party’s
general approval. Surely it would have been ridiculous
to substitute for that Government, because of its extrava-
£al?c®> another Ministry which would have been com-
pelled to take an almost similar course.
Here arises again the strange mental disease which
assumes that no public work can possibly be done
except out of loans—that it is almost criminal,
or at least quite revolutionary, to build anything
otherwise than out of loans. If the unemployed
had been maintained without working—simply as
a matter of charity—it seems to be assumed by
the Worker that that might have been done
out of revenue, but when it is proposed that
they should be maintained at about the same
cost on public works, then the only alternative is
“to find work with borrowed money.” The
criminality of building anything except out
of loans asserts itself immediately. The
See-Owe’Sollivan Government, it is true, had
fully £2,000,000 more money to spend last year
than was available in 1899; its revenue was about
£1,500,000 larger than that of 1899, and it had
been relieved by the Australian Government of
about £1,000,000 of postal, telegraphic and
military expenditure ; and as its old age pensions
absorbed about £500,000 it was £2,000,000 to the
good. Then it had every opportunity to increase
the land-tax on large estates, and the income-tax
on large incomes, and to levy an absentee-tax, and
make the local government bodies carry a larger
share of the public responsibilities (as they do in
Britain) and increase their rates. It was quite
possible to find £3,000,000 a year for public works
without borrowing, but the Government was shift-
less and incapable, and the Labor party was
the same, and so the good old loan happened
along as usual. If the Labor party made
honest finance the price of its support it would
probably get its price, but nothing seems to be
further from its intentions. If it couldn’t get its
price it might make a bid for office itself, move
its own vote of censure on the great Loan Govern-
ment, and let a M‘Gowen Ministry (if it couldn’t
attract to itself enough new supporters in the
present Assembly) appeal to the country as a
Ministry that proposed to meet its public works
expenditure out of revenue and be done with the
borrowing disease. Apparently nothing is further
from its intentions than that also, yet it is quite
possible that such a Ministry might come back
with a majority, and then Labor would be free
from the dismal necessity to buy democratic con-
cessions by winking at jobs and extravagances,
and would no longer have to put up with See
because Carruthers is as bad. But the Labor
Earty seems to have decided that it must either
e the dejected tail of a See Loan Government
or the dragging caudal appendage of a Car-
ruthers Loan Government, and that is a good
frame of mind to get out of.
N.S.W. Government and tke Citizens’
Life Office.
The papers laid before N.S.W. Assembly in
connection with the lease by the See Government
from the Citizens’ Life Assurance Co. —a pro-
prietary concern with Premier See as chairman of
directors—do not make the position any the better
for the Government, though they reveal some new
and rather curious facts. Percy E. Williams,
Comptroller of the P.O. Savings Bank, in a long
letter, states that the necessity of new accommoda-
tion for the P.O. Savings Bank was apparent to
him before “he was even aware that such a co. as
the Citizens’existed,” which ignorance on his part
the Comptroller trusts the Citizens’ will kindly
pardon, and “that not until after he had sent
the Citizens’ proposal to the Minister for favor-
able consideration was he incidentally made aware
that John See was a member of the directorate of
that company.” There is, of course, nothing
censurable in Percy E. Williams’ ignorance,
but it is at least curious that a bank
manager should not know of the existence of a
large and well-advertised financial institution
which rears its tall head office only a few yards
away from his premises, and that he should be
able to enter into a large business negotation
with a company without finding out even by acci-
dent who were its principal officers. However,
that is not of much importance ; nobody suspects
Premier See of any corrupt motive in the matter.
What is charged against him and against his
Government is a neglect of the public interests,
and an astonishing blindness to the requirements
of political propriety—not to say decency.
One remarkable matter is the statement that,
whilst the Citizens’ Life Co. could put up a
suitable building for Savings Bank purposes in
seven months, it would take two years for the
Government to do it, and it is owing, it seems, to
this astounding incompetence on its own part
that the Government, instead of building on
its own land, is driven to lease, at a huge
rent, the building that the Citizens’ is going
to put up. No word of explanation as to the
cause of the Government’s incompetence in build-
ing matters is offered. Is there any statute in
existence which forbids the See Government being
even half as prompt as a private co. in building
operations ? It seems there is, for it is accepted
as quite a fixed and unquestionable fact that the
Government must take two years in doing what
someone else can do in seven months. Another
faot, which has not been hitherto published, is
that the Savings Bank is not to have the ivhole of
the building erected by the Citizens’ Life Co. Two
floors of it are to be reserved for the co. But the
Government is to pay rent on a 5 per cent, basis
for all of the land at £3OO per foot, and for as
much of the building as costs £13,000 —which may
be the whole of it. There actually was one public
servant who saw the transaction in the right
light, and had the courage to point out the flaw
in it. J. Davis, Under-Secretary for Public
Works, wrote:
Assuming that the value of the land fronting.the Post-
office is £6OO per foot, amounting to £51*003, then the
interest at present being paid at 4 per cent, is £2040. If
this be added to the proposed rent to be paid the Citizens’
Life Assurance Company, £2OOO, the amount involved
will be £4040. On the other hand, supposing a £13,000
building were erected on the block of land opposite the
Post-office, then the interest at 4 per cent, on the build-
ing and land would amount to £2560, or a difference in
favor of the Post-office site of £l4BO per annum.
Assuming, however, that the value of the land in
Martin-place is the same as that in Moore-street owned
by the Citizens’ Life Assurance Company, £3OO per foot,
although in the former case it has a less depth than in
the latter, then the position would be as follows :
Cost of building .. £13,000
Value of land 25,500
Interest at 4 per cent, per annum .. .. 1,540
As against the Citizens’ Life Assurance C 0... 2,000
That, of course, is the position, from an economi-
cal point of view, in a nutshell. The Government,
through not using its own land, but allowing it to
be idle, is losing 4 per cent, at least on its own
value ; by utilising it for a Savings Bank that loss
would be saved. But even omitting that con-
sideration, the action of the See Government in
coming to a bargain with the See assurance com-
pany is a most improper one. Even if the bargain
were a good one, which it is not, the transaction
would be censurable. The Assembly has to come
to a decision on that point this (Thursday) even-
ing, and if it does its duty will certainly insist on
the repudiation of the contract, irrespective of
consequences. It is already forecasted, however,
that there will not be any such development.
The motion reads:—
That this House disapprove of the agreement entered
into by the Treasurer with the Citizens’ Life Assurance
Company.
And it is rumored that the Labor party will move,
quite irrelevantly, that the P.O. Savings Bank and
the Barrack-street Savings Bank should be amal-
gamated; and that under cover of that amendment
a vote on the direct issue will be shirked. Such a
conclusion to the matter would involve an astonish-
ing display of political agility, but nothing is
impossible to the N.S.W. Assembly or to any
party in it. If, however, it is desired to avoid a
direct vote on the matter, the joke might be made
a little more obvious for the sake of a public which
is sometimes rather obtuse. An amendment, for
instance, expressing the House’s detestation of the
Balkan massacres would be just as pertinent to
the issue.

A Remarkable Claim.
A remarkable-looking claim was that of the
Howard Smith Co., Limited, shipowners, for
£250,000 as compensation for the resump-
tion by the Government of two wharves in
Sydney. (The Government offered £35,250.)
The case looked remarkable in many ways,
but chiefly in the . light of the company’s
balance-sheet. That dooument (dated 31st
December, 1902) declared to the shareholders
that the value of all the company’s freehold and
leasehold property in all parts of Australia, and
anywhere else where it possesses property, was
£43,901, and the balance-sheet containing these
values was sworn to, under the Victorian law,
which makes a false declaration punishable as
wilful and corrupt perjury, to be correct to the
best of the manager’s knowledge and belief. On
the face of things it seems difficult to suppose
that the manager should imagine the value of all
the co. ’s freehold and leasehold property to be only
£43,901 when its wharves in one city alone were
worth nearly six times that amount, therefore the
matter seems to call for some explanation. The
company’s whole paid-up capital, at last Decem-
ber, was <£386,245, of which £249,521 was invested
in “ steamers and plant,” so everything it owned,
apart from steamers and plant, doesn’t seem to even
approach the alleged value of these two wharves. It
would be specially interesting to know what land-
tax or municipal tax was paid on this immensely
valuable Sydney property. Eor the sake of its
own credit the company should throw some light
on the situation in its next balance-sheet, and thus
clear itself of any possible suspicion of attempting
to make a wholly unjustifiable profit out of the
State. It is a great deal more objectionable to
try to make an unjustifiable profit out of 1,400,000
people all at once than to try to do, t(|e same out
of only one person—which is the reason why ex-
planation is called for. If any person or corpora-
tion tried to get from the State, say, £200,000
more than it was entitled to, and succeeded, then
the writer’s share of the loss, for self and family,
would be about £1 ss. That is sufficient reason
for inquiry on the writer’s part, and on the part
of every other citizen.
♦
Victorian Old Age Pensions.
The Victorian Government’s Old Age Pension
Bill is worthy of it. The maximum pension is to
be cut down to 7s. a week—the pension may,
however, be any less amount. The little dole is
now assumed to be a loan, and the pensioner
can be sold up to recover the money. The
total amount spent on pensions is not to
exceed £150,000 a year, and only one new pension
is to be granted for every two old pensions can-
celled by death or otherwise, till this limit is
reached. The claimant is now required to show,
not merely that he is unable to maintain himself,
but that he is ‘‘incapable of maintaining himself,”
which is quite a different thing. There are very
many persons of 65. and even 70, who are quite
capable of doing work to the value of Bs. or 10s. a
week if they could get the work to do; the reason
why they can’t get it to do is that the average
employer doesn’t want four or five venerables
pottering round at 10s. each to do, among
them, the work that one young man will
do for £2 or 50s. The State sets this kind
of employer an example, in many cases, by
compulsorily retiring men at 65 (provided they
have no compensation rights) whether they are
fit for work or not, and it is just that tendency
to get the venerable out of the way that makes
the trouble. Irvine’s Bill sets up the theory
that when the State throws a man out for being
old he isn’t entitled to a pension because he
might have been able to go on working if the
State had allowed him to do so—-which it didn’t.
The new measure further provides that nobody
with more than £lO worth of assets is to receive a
pension. Also all manner of relatives are held
liable for the support of their aged connections,
and financial institutions may be compelled to
supply information about the positions of those
relatives and their ability to pay. This is almost
the only redeeming feature—indirectly redeeming
feature, that is—in the case. Quite a number of
very high-toned persons have hitherto dodged the
duty of supporting aged uncles and other family
side-issues, and the possible spectacle of Premier
Irvine calling at the National Bank with a lump
of ice in his hand, and demanding to see the state
of the overdraft of Blank, M.L.C., who has failed
to aid in supporting his first wife’s brother, has
something to recommend it.

Mr. Spruce Myth’s Nigger.
The beautifully-dressed figure of Spruce Myth
looms up largely nowadays among the crowd of
Tories who are trying to lead the newly-enfran-
chised Australian woman astray. The following
is from a recent address whioh that well-tailored
person delivered at Burwood (N.S.W.), and ex-
hibits Mr. Myth at his best
Legislation had been passed which was an insult to the
Japanese people. When the matter came before Parlia-
ment he found he was the only man brave enough to
stand up for the Japanese, and, if he lost his seat through
it, he would continue to advocate his views, not only with
regard to the Japanese, but other races as well. When a
man became a citizen of an Empire he should be able to
go to any part of that Empire, and he had no sympathy
with legislation of the “six hatters” description. He
advised them not to be led away with talk of the negro in
the United States. A similar danger did not exist here,
where the colored races were coming and going continu-
ally. In the Northern Territory even, there was nothing
in the state of affairs to cause them to stand up and pass
measures of an hysterical and ridiculous description, and
make themselves the laughing stock of the world.
Apart from the fact that the overbearing
Japanese bounder started the insult business by
enacting that no Britisher or other foreigner was
good enough to hold an inch of land in his coun-
try (probably Spruce Myth rather likes being
trodden on by brown heathens), these questions
are worth asking :
(1) How does Mr. Myth know that, if we admit colored
men freely, no nigger problem can possibly arise here
such as exists in the United States ? It takes an immense
amount of foresight to know that, and Mr. Myth hadn’t
even enough foresight to know that a certain land bank
was going to burst. (The fact that he showed great
pluck and honesty in facing the financial consequences
makes no difference as regards the lack of foresight.)
_ (2) Where is it laid down that when a man becomes a
citizen of an empire he should have the free run of that
empire ? Writer has hunted all through the Scripture,
and can’t find it.
(3) When did the Hindoo and all the other niggers
become full-blown citizens of the empire, seeing that they
are, in their own country, debarred from the franchise,
declared unfit to enjoy self-governing privileges, and
the alleged British principle that taxation and represen-
tation go together is suspended in their case ? If Britain,
which knows these niggers so much better than we do,
declares them unfit to enjoy the privileges of citizenship,
who is Myth that he should contradict ?
This last question is one that The Bulletin has
laid before many prominent nigger advocates, and
the issue has been meanly shirked by all of them.
The Bulletin now makes Spruce Myth a straight-
out offer. If Britain will put its Indian nigger
on the same level as the Englishman, make
him a full-blown citizen, acknowledge him as
an equal, give him, in proportion to his
numbers, the same right to help to govern
the empire that the Englishman enjoys—in
fact, will decide that he is the same as any
other Britisher —then The Bulletin will vote for
his free admission to Australia. Meanwhile, it is
willing to join with Spruce Myth and George
Reid in remonstrating with Britain on its vil-
lainous conduct in shutting out the Hindoo from
so many of the blessed privileges of British citizen-
ship. The fact that the best-educated native of
India is debarred, in his own country, from poli-
tical rights enjoyed by an English agricultural
laborer should make Spruce Myth’s blood boil,
and should almost make him turn Boer.
«
The Religion of an Tipper House.
A Stawell (Vic.) storekeeper died recently,
leaving his property (£583) to an acquaintance,
and a balance of an odd shilling to his widow.
That proceeding is quite legal under the fool
law which the Victorian House of 48 Rich
Landlords has just flatly refused to amend. A Bill,
was submitted to it providing that a widow should
have a claim on a certain proportion of her hus-
band’s estate, no matter how his will ran, and the
House of Landlords decided that the idea repre-
sented a gross outrage on Property, and cast the
measure out with indignation on its reddened.coun-
tenanee. The Stawell storekeeper, be it noted, had
no power to cut off his wife with Is. while he was-
alive; she had a good and sufficient claim against
the live man’s estate. But the foolish law
gives the dead man privileges that it never dreams
of giving to a man before he is dead. At times,
of course, a man who .cuts off his widow with Is.
may have a legitimate grievance against her, but;
even that doesn’t seem to materially affect the-
case. The public probably has to support the old
lady who has been disinherited, and so it pays for
the deceased’s grievance, and there is no reason,
why it should pay for the grievance of any can-
tankerous old person. If she was a bad wife the
public has still quite enough to do with its money
without supporting anybody’s bad widow merely
on account of her badness. The Upper House,
which refused to amend this law, is, curiously'
enough, a very religious body—a certain kind,
of religious. It believes that the wicked and.
revengeful man will be fried in the next;
world, and the bitterly unforgiving man who-
dies in the hope that his widow, whether
good or bad, will starve when he is gone, will,
certainly fry something considerable according to-
the theology of these hard old M’s.L.C. Yet the-
proposal to prevent him carrying this extra sin
with him when he goes to his long gridiron didn’t
appeal to the House of Landlords. In its view,
the right to be bitterly revengeful to the last, and',
to die in sin, is a sacred right. The Bulletin
somehow doesn’t envy these stony old gentle-
men their religion. It seems to be one that any
decent citizen would prefer to be without.
*
The Partial Caving-in of the
Landlords.
The Victorian House of 48 Rich Landlords, afer
its outburst of blind fury against the Factouies.
Bill, finally listened to a certain amount of reasom
—or was terrorised into a semblance of doing so..
The papers had hardly announced that the minimurai
wage clause had been cut out as applied to adults
male workers before the Anti-Sweating League’
and the Trades Hall Council moved. Sunday
saw a huge crowd throng into Fitzgeralds’ Circus;
building to listen to well-known citizens denouncing:
the obstructionists in good set terms. And as the-
beefy ancients trammed up Collins-street on.
Tuesday evening to the House, where the Bilk
was to be re-committed, they saw another throng,,
that would fill the building three times over,
hammering at the doors of the Town Hall in the-
vain hope of joining the packed thousands inside
who were even then urging Peacock and
M‘Kinnon to “give it them straight” and “let

the Incapables that, compared to these thou-
sands, the Employers’ Federation was worse-
than a broken reed and the Sweater a thing.
of naught; and that possibly a few hun-
dreds—or even the overflow thousands —might
take it into their heads to walk into the sacred
Council Chamber itself and argue with them per-
sonally. Also, in the interim, Ministers in the
Council had rounded up certain Landlords who
had been absent on the former occasion, and told
them plainly that their House was kicking
against a wall, and that it was a wall that was
always liable to fall upon the kicker. Anyhow,
before the Town Hall meeting was over, the Land-
lords had crawled down, and though an important
point or two was yielded by the Assembly at the
subsequent conference, the existing boards remain
and the Act was passed.. In some respects, it is
an improvement on Turner’s first Act; in others
—where the Council interfered—a considerable
retrogression. A simple majority, instead of
seven-tenths, now fixes a Wages Board de-
termination ; witnesses may be compelled to
f'ive evidence on oath ; apprentices are un-
imited, but must be indentured for three years
and have their wages fixed by the Boards; all
other “infants” are improvers, whose numbers
are limited and wages fixed ; an Appeal Court —
consisting of a Supreme Court judge and two
assessors—may revise Wages Board decisions.
This Court must not fix a minimum wage higher
than the average wage paid by “ reputable ”
(whoever they are) employers, and must not fix
a wage or determine hours or do anything else
that may injure an industry, but must in no case
substitute (for the Board determination) a rate
below a living wage. Wages Boards may fix
piece-work rates that will scotch, if not kill,
the “task” system (whereby an extra fast
worker is put on wages and others paid at
piece-work rates based on the fast man’s
output). Children of employers are exempt
(while in their parents’ factories) from mini-
mum wage provisions. The Act applies to
industries within 10 miles of cities and towns,
and elsewhere in the State if municipal councils
petition. The worst amendment is that new
Wages Boards may only be appointed on resolution
of both Houses. The laundries and the furniture
trades still come under the Act, though Chinese
are not specially legislated for. In other respects
the Act is practically Turner’s first measure over
again. It isn’t what it might be by a good deal,
but then again, it isn’t what the 48 Rich Landlords
and the Employers’ Federation would like, by a
good deal more ; also, it is standing evidence that
the 48 Tories are as timid as they are heartless;
and that it only wants a really strong man to
dragoon them into Submission on almost any
point. The new Act expires on December 31st,
1905, and when that day arrives it is to be hoped
the man will have arrived, too; or that, by
Federal action, there will be no need for his
advent.
♦
The Unstable Mining - Industry.
The most interesting and important amendment
so far proposed in the Mines Bill, now before the
Vic. Assembly, comes from Alf. Bailes, one of
the Bendigo members, who wants to insist upon
every No Liability co. building up a reserve fund.
Bailes’ idea is that 2| per cent, of the amount of
every proposed dividend shall be put to the fund
until it is equal to 5 per cent, of the subscribed
capital, and that every director who takes part in
declaring or pacing a dividend without complying
with this provision shall be personally liable for
the reserve-fund contribution. The principle the
Bendigo man seeks to establish is sound to the
core, but all his figures are too insignificant. The
statutory contribution ought to be 10 f>6,r cent.,
and the contributions should not cease till at
least 20 per cent, of the subscribed capital is
available. In fact, there is no particularly
good reason why there should be any limit at all.
Further, the fund ought to be invested in
some public security; if there isn’t some
such provision the money will be “invested
in the business”; that is to say, it will be put
into a crab-winch, or a multi-tubular boiler, ora
patent stone-cracker, or something of the kind,
which the c-o. would have required in any case,
so that, after all, there will be no money available
with which to explore new country and carry on
operations when the payable run is worked out.
One of the Moon group of mines, for a couple of
years past the most profitable in the State, lately
began to put by a little, and the directors
admitted quite cheerfully that that was just how
they proposed to “invest” it—in machinery.
Mining always will be a good deal of a
gamble; even Bailes’ proposal, improved as
suggested, can’t put a payable reef into a wild cat.
Still a whole lot of other undertakings would be
gambles, too, if they were run in the same fashion.
The insurance company which, not having had to
pay many claims in the year, declared a bonus
big enough to swallow up the whole of the surplus
premiums, would get on its uppers quite as
rapidly as most mining companies do when they
pursue just that sort of idiotic policy. Down
to now the State has done a good deal to make
mining a gamble instead of an industry. It has,
for example, provided a No Liability Act, under
which the shareholder, even though he has taken
up a £1 share, is entitled to drop it at any moment,
notwithstanding that only eighteenpence has been
actually paid, and thus leave all the other share-
holders in the lurch. The State has done
this for the crowd that looks on a mine in
much the same way that another crowd (which is
to a great extent the same crowd over again) looks
on a racehorse—as something to hang a bet on to.
Now, it is about up to the State to do something
for the miner—the man to whom a mine is the
basis of an industry, and not a mere counter in a
gamble. That man’s curse is the uncertainty of
his occupation. The mine that can employ-
hundreds to-day, and scatter thousands in divi-
dends, is either shut down to-morrow or is able to
pay only a handful of men out of the calls that
are dragged from reluctant shareholders. One
result is that'the miner is a rover. In nearly
every case he lives in discomfort. His home is a
temporary affair —he dare not make it otherwise.
He suffers, of course; but his wife and children
suffer still more. And that wife and those children
are calling loudly to the Victorian Assembly to do
this thing—this little thing that is within its
?ower —not to give stability to the industry (for
arliament cannot do that), but to make it less
unstable.

Mr. W. Young, New South Wales M.L.A. for
Bathurst —the place that no one voted for as the
Federal capital—froths at the mouth over the
fact: —
It was for this State to assert its rights and lay down
the situation for the Federal capital and tell the Federal
Parliament that they insisted on them taking the one
■chosen. If the Federal Parliament did not comply with
the proposal and accept the site laid down he would have
no hesitation in declaring that this-State should burst up
the union at the first opportunity. The proposal he
made was that they should offer the Federal Parliament
the Lyndhurst site—the only site in the State carrying
with it commercial and social benefits.
Lyndhurst is the site at Bathurst’s back-door.
Why doesn’t this small political insect secede on
Ihis own and start the bursting up ? The BULLETIN
ihas no respect for the revolutionary person, who

Sydney’s craving for something new will
be pacified on Saturday by the production at
Her Majesty’s of “A Country Girl ” for the first
time in Australia.. The comic opera show is to
be turned on in full force, and part of
Williamson’s musical comedy co. has been
borrowed to strengthen the cast. Therefore
Sydney expects to see something large and
vigorous on Saturday, and it is buying its ticket
in a lavish spirit. It is on occasions like this that
the public realises how vast an opening there is
for that prospective genius who will devise
a compact theatre that will hold 3000 people,
and where every d.c. seat will be a front
Seat, and every stall seat will be close
up to the orchestra, and where there will be
six boxes, all on the ground floor close alongside
the stage; and the gallery, and the family oircle
and the d.c. will also be on the ground floor along
with the stalls, each of them in front, so as to com-
mand an uninterrupted view. A theatre built on
such lines, would almost certainly be popular,
especially if it had a first night every day, and the
idea is worth the consideration of inventors. Un-
happily, it can’t be worked out in time for the
“Country Girl” show, but the production pro-
mises to struggle along pretty well on the old
lines.
** * *
Miss Ada Crossley will appear in “Elijah ”
with the Philharmonic Society to-inorrow (Friday)
night, at Sydney Town Hall. Every seat, except
a cobwebbed one in the corner of the hall, is taken.
The contralto sings the “Angel” r6le; basso Peter-
kin trumpets for the prophet Elijah. Everyone
looks forward to hearing Miss Crossley’s rendering
of “O, Rest in the Lord,” as to-morrow night’s
appearance will absolutely be her last Australian
showing in oratorio.
** * *
At Sydney Lyceum “ Her Second Time on
Earth ” still rages, and by a careful attention to
details—such as providing a real cab with areal
horse for the bridegroom to drive up to church,
and a real brougham with tivo real white horses to
bring the bride —impresses big audience? with its
abounding merits. The quality of the horse-flesh
on the Lyceum stage is always good, and the
people judge the whole of the show by that stan-
dard and are profoundly satisfied. Perhaps, too,
there are worse standards.
With a couple of changes in the cast,
“The French Spy ” has been a more satisfactory
performance at Sydney Palace this week than it
was last —and last week it was a very good per-
formance in places, and especially in the places in
which Miss Fitzmaurice Gill held most of the
stage. A change will be made at the end of this
week, when “ The Bank of England ” will be put
on, presumably with the object of showing that
there’s quite a lot of money in the world that
Australia hasn’t borrowed yet.

After Friday night’s performance at
Sydney Criterion, Charles Holloway will put
away Father Dolan’s clothes where the moths
cannot get at them, and the Shaughraun will give
over putting a drop of the creature into the good
man’s tea. On the next night “Two Little
Vagabonds” will be revived, mainly with the
object of giving Holloway time to prepare some
extra-special sensation. Still, “ Two Little Vaga-
bonds” is worth reviving in any case, for it was
the best thing the co. has done, and the vagabonds
are a pair of deeply-interesting youngsters, any-
how.

If Harry Rickards will insist upon engaging
people like Marzella, who can fill the Tivoli week
after week, all that can be done is to say Ditto to
previous notices until some other attraction comes
along to crowd Marzella out. But Marzelja’s is
such a remarkable show, and so unlike every other
show, that when it is crowded out it can hardly
be replaced by a prettier or more interesting one.

“The Great Millionaire,” which is Bland
Holts latest venture in Drury Lane drama at
Melbourne Royal, has all the virtues and faults of
‘ The Price of Peace, ’ and other plays composed
by Cecil Raleigh. In certain places it is better
than the best, or worse than the worst, of Raleigh’s
previous work. The attempts at character draw-
ing are more ambitious, the incidents are more
difficult to present in a convincing way, the plot
is more broken, the demands upon the actors are
more severe, and the necessity for an extra
stage-manager is more obvious than ever. Until
Bland Holt meets the difficulty by making* special
engagements for these exacting Raleigh dramas,
apd imports a stage manager who understands
the working of all their points, he will continue
to get more trouble than profit by them. “The
Great Millionaire,” as produced on Saturday,
merely offers suggestions of the show it is intended
to be. It amounts to an expensive failure; far
preferable to an ordinary low-down popular melo-
drama, but a failure, all the same, from a critical
point of view. Even the plot of the story was
not effectively revealed on the first night.
* * * *
The Millionaire is seemingly meant for a
ha,rd, elderly, combative speculator, a callous
misanthropic brute on one side of his character,
and something of a kindly gentleman on the
other. As a landowner he makes himself a terror
to trespassers by undermining his precious park
with fireworks and things which “go off” sud-
denly when walked upon or sat upon by poachers
and picnickers. Subsequently he takes a fancy to
a busted lordling and pays him an enormous
retaining fee, in return for which the young man
follows his patron around London and condemns
his actions in a quiet sort of way. They go to-
gether to the Guildhall, where the Millionaire, in
some official capacity or other, is prepared to
grovel to King Edward, but before the King
arrives the Millionaire is denounced for sharp
practices as a company promoter, and, being
shooed off the premises, he vows vengeance on
Great Britain. This audaciously original scene
terminates with the royal entrance of an absurd
Edward and Alexandra, the stage lined by a lot
of comic opera peers in flowing robes. The
Millionaire’s vengeance turns out to be a bread
famine. He works a corner in wheat, and
raises the price of the quartern loaf to five
“bob,” whereupon the hungry toilers are
moved to a feeble riot, and poor Miss Ross
is overcome by starvation. All this time the
Millionaire has been looking for a long-lost
daughter, and when he runs up against the Bread
Riot he discovers that Miss Ross, fainting for a
loaf, is the child he loves. Eventually she dies, a
victimised heiress to all his millions ; but in the
meantime his secretary bolts with his private
cipher-book, and the remorseful parent is
threatened with ruin because a rival mil-
lionaire intends to hoist him with his
own cipher. At this crisis the retained
lordling chases the absconded secretary. It
is a motor-car race between the pair, and the
sec.’s motor runs over a precipice. Many other
remarkable incidents, more or less probable, but
violently original as a rule, are held over for
future comment. Fifty-three characters figure on
the programme of “The Great Millionaire.”
Walter Baker plays the name part powerfully, up
to the point where he discovers his daughter, and
the other members of Bland Holt’s stock co. fill
less responsible positions. In some cases, the
acting is not equal to the character, but it can
have a week for improvement ere this paper passes
severe sentence upon it. Scenery by Brunton
reflects some more of the usual credit on that
respected identity.

“Sweet Nell” at Melbourne Princess’s
promised on Saturday to crowd the house every
evening for a week. With one exception the
people who support Nellie Stewart and her nut-
brown King are the same who appeared in the
previous revival. Harry Hill still plays the roar-
ful Jeffries with less roar than Gran put into
the part, and Vernon Steele is the same
tall and likely young Roger Fairfax as before
with an undiminished foreign accent. It is
said to be a Mexican accent, and as such it
seems to need careful medical treatment to
prevent it becoming chronic. On Saturday next
the Only Nellie will make her first Melbourne
appearance as Peg Woffington, the actress who
substituted her real face (in the play) for an oil
painting, and was mistaken for the picture. Miss
Nellie has already impersonated three various
actresses —Gwynne, Zaza and Dolores—with
happy results, therefore Woffington is expected to
increase her reputation by at least one Peg.

Mel. B. Spurr, the monologue entertainer
from London, took the floor at Melbourne
Athenaeum Hall on Derby night, and showed just
cause for coming a long distance with a one-man
show. The new-comer, who in his youth sat at
the feet of Corney Grain, is an efficient laugh-
maker, with a dainty touch on the piano, a poor
singing voice, and a rich repertoire of low-comedy
grimaces. In the department of mimicry, Mel.
B.’s work comes under the head of burlesque
rather than imitation. • His old general, half-pay
admiral, Mam'zelle at the fancy fair, etc., are
laughable impersonations, true to stereotyped
English stage traditions of military, naval,
and Parisian character. But for the pre-
sent, Australia is’'fortunately unable to appre-
ciate fully the monologuer’s caricatures of
Generals, Admirals, haw-haw chappies, or pomp-
ous M.P.’s prompted in their speeches by a
private secretary. Of such as these she knows
little and cares less. Mr. Spurr, roaming this un-
hackneyed Commonwealth, might do worse than
pick up some new models from the ranks of
suburban aldermen and wild-cat politicians. ’ The
programme, mostly humorous, gains an agreeable
spice of variety from occasional lapses into sadness
and cynicism. One of these, a recitation, styled
“The Game of Life,” deals with the four “suits,”
love, wealth, war and death, and the speaker softly
plays appropriate music on his zither, knelling
forth the “ Dead March ” in unison with the fall-
ing of spades. The Spurr show is for everyone
who wants a laugh and can admire the pluck and
go of one small artistic man in singing, playing,
moralising and speechifying, and generally keep-
ing the ball rolling on his own for a whole
evening.
Fitzgerald Bros’, circus continues to cirque
in its largest and most complete manner, and the
local horse festival feels grateful for the presence
of brothers Tom and Dan. Next Saturday night,
bv which time the personal popularity of Horse
will be waning somewhat, is to introduce Doctor
Gordon' to the arena. The Doc. is another
Sandow in a different kind of way. The muscles
of his tongue are splendidly developed, and he
talks freely whilst performing feats of strength in
a swallow-tailed coat and a hard-boiled shirt.

“Beaucaire,” the cheerful comedy of
clothes, will point its patent leather shoes and
shake its handkerchief at the Melbourne public
until Friday (6th). A very different variety of
oostume play comes to Her Majesty s on Satur-
day. “The Eternal City,” by Hall Caine, will be
staged in place of the city of Bath, where the buns
come from, and the Williamson advt. promises a
gorgeous production with Italian musical effects.

At the Opera House a micro-bioscope
gives the Rickards public an object lesson in the
domestic economy of beehives, and presents the
horrors of ripe cheese in an exaggerated form.
Melbourne was rather tired of biograph a week
ago, but the living-insect pictures that came to
light on Saturday are a new attraction. The De
Wynnes returned to the Opera House last week,
likewise Irving Sayles, the well-remembered dark
fentleman with an elastio smile. And the lhree
)umonds, described as the greatest musical
comedians outside of heaven, were due on Monday
of this week.

“ Are You a Mason ? ” holds the stage at
Adelaide Royal without any opposition, and has
had crowded houses, in spite of some early hot
weather. George Giddens has been accepted at
once as a first-rate comedian of the quiet type,
but much regret is expressed at the absence of
Cecil Ward, who is a great favorite in Adelaide,
and whose likeness has been freely billed in
various scenes from the play. George Majeroni
makes a fair substitute. The ladies are all good.
The Wild Cat Column.
People who don’t want Australia to think that
it is its own bad habits that have landed it in trouble,
are telling it to just wait till "the wave of adversity”
has rolled by, and it can start producing up to its old
standard again. And the fact is that there is no wave of
adversity in the aggregate, and it is producing up to its
old standard now. Of course there have been wheat and
wool disasters, but there is another Bide to the picture.
This year the Commonwealth will produce something
like £16,000,000 worth of gold. (Last year it produced
£14,811,991 worth, and in the first nine months of this
year the output was 349,8370 z. ahead of what it was to
Sept. 30, 1902.) Even last year’s figure was half-a-million
higher than the giddiest heights reached in the giddiest
year of the fifties. Comparing the figures of the past five
years with those of 10 years back we get these results: —
1889 .. .. £5,736,355 1899 .. .. £14,661,258
1890 .. .. 6,231,466 1900 .. .. 13,701,876
1891 .. .. 5,272,894 1901 .. .. 14,189,978
1892 .. .. 5,887,300 1902 .. .. 14,811,991
1893 .. .. 6,215,472 1903 (approx.) 16,000,000
Total ..£28,343,487 Total .. £73,365,098
The figures even for 1889-1893 were considerably above
the average for many years previously. In the last five
years, then, even if seasons have been on the whole in-
different, Australia has torn out of the ground £45,021,611
more gold than it did in the corresponding part of the
previous decade ; and that ought to be a pretty substan-
tial set-off against the reduction in wool and wheat. In
fact, so splendidly did the gold yield come to the rescue
that the value of all Australia’s products per head was
more in 1901, the drought year, than in 1891, the boom
year. So there was no wave of adversity on the
country, as a whole, to account for our troubles.
The wool and wheat business will get better, of
course, and the gold business will get worse, of course,
gold being a product which doesn’t renew itself each
year. But the lost boom won’t come back by mere
effluxion of time, for we can’t spend the borrowed money
over again, or sell the lands over again. A total produc-
tion (wool, wheat, gold, etc,) of £3O 13s. 6d. per head
meant great prosperity in 1891; an average production
of £3O 16s. per head meant dismal poverty in 1901,
because the best of the land had been sold in the interim,
and there was less loan money coming in and more
interest going out, and the I O U was coming home to
roost. And if the loan policy continues, an average
production of £3l per head will probably mean starva-
tion in 1911.

posed to have, to a great extent, reformed and given up
borrowing this is modest, being equal to only about
£2 Is. 6d. per head of the population. To keep up to
that N.S.W. would have to borrow at the rate of
£2,850,000 a year. So far Queensland has had the Biggest
Debt per Head on Earth; but, with the northern
Treasurer sitting down hard on borrowing, it looks as
though the dishonor will pass to S.A. pretty soon. At

Queensland’s borrowings have since then been slightly

Iscariot’s State goes ahead, the latter—the poorest of

The reserves consist of ordinary reserve fund £65,000,
re-insurance reserve £23,000, for the equalisation of
dividends £7OOO, for the depreciation of investments
£lO 000, and undivided balance £14,256. The objection-
able reserve for the equalisation of dividends has again
been added to. It doesn’t matter what this money is
called • the fact remains that the directors apparently
contemplate some day paying a dividend, not
out of current profits, . but out of reserves.
A reserve for equalisation of dividends is chiefly useful to
make a business look presentable long enough for the
people inside to get out, supposing it should some day
start to decay ; and the United Insurance, not being a
concern of that kind, has no use at all for a fund for such
a purpose, and it should not set a bad example to other
less respectable concerns. The co’s paid capital is
£68,226 ; on that and the reserves as at the opening of
the year, the profit was equal to a very handsome £l2 9s.

(£5171) were equal to paying a dividend of 7* per cent.,

The usual 10 per cent, and a few pounds to spare has
been made, according to the published accounts ; the
uniformity of the returns suggests either the existence
of an inner reserve or the writing down of mill and other
properties for depreciation. As the whole of the reserves
are used in the business, and as the directors think that
the limit of profitable expansion has not yet been
reached, there is to be a further issue of capital in the
already huge concern. The authorised capital is now
£2,104,000 ; this is to be increased to £3,000,000, though
at ’present the issued capital will only be advanced from
£2,000,000 to £2,200,000. Part Of the new issue will be
devoted to retiring debentures (£50,000) which mature
next June.

Brisbane Telegraph is the last paper to get
hold of the remarkable idea that there are capitalists
hovering round eager to snap up Australian railways at
the price of the national debt. “ The annual loss on our
(Queensland) railways,” says the Telegraph. “is about
half-a-million. Why keep such a losing concern l A
company would readily be found to take over the rai -
ways as a going concern at the price of our national
debt.” This idea, that the railways are good and nego-
tiable security for the whole of our debt, is encountered
very frequently, but it is never backed up by anything
better than a majestic sweep of the arm. And companies
with £40,000,000 or so to invest don’t regard lordly sweeps
as assets of much consequence ; they want to get down
to facts and figures. And here are a few to go on with.
The Queensland national debt was, on June 30, iskw,
£39,338,427— say 40 millions. A co., working on busi-
ness lines, would want at least 4 per cent. Also,
the money being invested in things that rot ana
rust, it would want to put aside at least
2.V per cent, to cover depreciation, renewals, etc. Die
allowance would probably have to be greater, hut it can
be left at that. The 6* per cent, would call for £2,600,0uu
over working expenses. But the gross receipts last year
were only £1,234,230. If, therefore, two tons of goods
could be carried for every ton carried now, and two
passengers could be crowded in where one is carried
now, and if the whole staff worked for nothing at all.
and nobody charged anything for coal or oil; or if
everybody paid the company twice as much as
he pays the State, and the company paid
nobody anything—then such a company as Brisbane
Telegraph talks about would be possible. In anv
other circumstances, it would not he possible. And
probably the Telegraph’s company would not take the
Telegraph's guarantee as to any of these matters it
would want the State’s; pretty nearly every State which
has handed over its railway affairs to companies has, in
fact, had to give guarantees of some kind or other; atm
that system has simply meant that when there were
profits the co. has got them, but when there were losses
the State has had to hump them. British com pan les that
made railways in South America generally diddled these
luckless Latin republics out of 6 or 7 per cent, guaran tee..
And the State can hump the losses quite as well without
making any agreement to let someone else have tne
profits. , , , .

“H.S.R.”: Re the Australian explorer from
Glasgow referred to in Bulletin recently, I may say that
gems of a sort have been got for years in Queensland right
up to the Cloncurry. As a rule, they are of little of no-
value. For instance, lots of what is called sapphire will
not take a polish as it is too slatey, and will not what is
professionally termed “ top.” It is corundum. Same
with ruby. Zircon and opal have been found also. The
reason why we have those “ explorers ” coming out here
discovering mares’-nests and exploring country that has
been in occupation for nearly-a century,-Is probably the
ignorance shown by the Australian press about Aus-
tralia. In the U.K. they consequently fariby that we
spend our time leaning against posts, or cutting each
other’s hair, whilst our wives take in jach others wash-
ing. Hence God’s Englishman, and the Devil’s Irishman,
and the unspeakable Scot come to see if we are still alive.
In the meantime Jimbill has wheeled a barrow hundreds
of miles and explored the country all the time he was
supposed to be keeping the post up waiting for Cohen to
come to the rescue.

In order to reduce the liabilities to depositors by £4384,
the item, “ advanced shares, properties in possession,
&c.”, was reduced by £4BBO. Presumably, therefore,
the writing-down has not gone far enough.
If the transactions of the year could be taken
as a guide, then something like £lO,OOO or £ll,OOO
have still to be written off before the market value
is reached. Still, a single year’s transactions are
not too safe a guide. Twelve months ago it was
announced that the society was about to return to active
business, but there were unseen difficulties in the way,
and the prod'gal isn’t quite back yet. Prospects are,
however, at least fair for it when it does make a start;
its business profits in the past year were equal to 11J per
cent, of its nominally intact capital. Certainly it is
helped to this result by getting most of its deposits at
something less than the current rate; yet, even if its
deposits carried 1 per cent, more, the business profits
would bo equal to 8 per cent. ; and even assets that are
not reckoned to be depreciated cannot always do as well
as that. In spite of all this, however, the deposits are
out of all safe proportion to the capital. \

Here are some of the things that happened
while Thomas Bent was managing the Victorian railways
last year, according to the just-issued report:—
The receipts fell £320,985 as compared with the pre-
vious year.
It cost more per train mile to run the ricketty engines
over ricketty lines with a disorganised staff than in any
year since 1887.
The expenditure mopped up a greater percentage of
the gross receipts than in any other year since 1892.
The earnings per cent, on loan capital expended were
less than in any year on record, with one single excep-
tion.
The earnings per mile open have only once been lower
in 32 years.
The deficit per cent, on capital cost was more than
twice as great as the average of the three preceding
years.
In the past 32 years the working costs in proportion
to receipts have only four times been greater.
In all their history the Victorian railways have only
once earned less in proportion to capital cost, and that
was just after the bank smashes.
The receipts per train mile run were greater than in
any year from 1887 to 1900 ; yet there was only a single
year during that period when the net earnings were
less in proportion to cost.
The report furnishes a lot of other interesting proofs of
Bent’s fine capacity as a railway manager ; but these
ought to be enough to get Bent a job anywhere.

The results don’t make it much more certain than it was
last year that, the increase of dividend was a wise pro-
ceeding. The business profits have certainly increased
very satisfactorily, but the “net profit on property
sales ”is less than usual. The latter is, however, hardly
profit. The value of foreclosed property was written
down out of capital. It happens that it was written
down rather more than was necessary, and the profit on
property sales is merely part of the lost capital recovered.
The so-called profit of £2632 has been made in the past
year out of the sales of properties which were apparently
valued at £4259 ; the amount (gross) actually realised
was £6921. This is remarkably satisfactory realisation.
During the past four years the value of foreclosed pro-
perties has been reduced from £72,683 to £45,935, and
£10,975 net “ profit ” has been obtained ; that is to say,
properties down in the books for £26,748 have been sold
for £37,723 clear. At the same rate of realisation the
balance (£45,935) would bring in about £64,000. Still,
there probably will not be any violent hurry to realise
some of the properties. Their gross average return on
the present book-value is over 1-1 per cent., and even on
the £64,000 basis it is about 8 per cent. The society has
now reduced its deposits to £lo,6sB—they were up to a
giddy £190,000 13 years ago

A hard fight which has taken place in Brisbane
shows up the meanness of the Loan policy. The South
Brisbane Council wanted to borrow £20,000, and there
was a referendum on the question of raising it. Three-
pence added to the rates would bring in the whole
£20,000, or very near it ; yet, rather than pay up the
threepence and be done with it for ever, there was all
this row. This “£20,000 loan money can be borrowed
without increasing the rates, as the interest can be pro-
vided for out of the general rate,” ran an apparently
official address to the ratepayers. In other words, what
W'as proposed was to raise £20,000, spend it in increasing
the present value of property, and pass the bill on to some-
body else to pay after the works have been worn out. It
is some consolation that this mean little scheme to dodge
taxes was beaten ; but it wasn’t beaten so badly as its
meanness called for.

_A co. has been registered in Queensland which

sumed. “The claim,” the directors say, “still remains

has been exhausted to obtain payment of amount due, as
awarded by the court, now some 14 months since.” And
the Owe’-See, from whom the co. can’t get the money
awarded 14 months ago, is the same Owe’-See who is quite
angry with certain critics for reflecting upon the credit of
his State and Government. The amount due, with costs,
is about £19,000. The co.’s position shows no material
change from that disclosed six months ago.

It is turning out that “Janny” Leahy’s rail-
way “economies” in Queensland were mostly fished out
of the same place that Bent’s came from. Leahy “saved"
£129,369 in 12 months ; but as he earned £147,949 less,
the net results were worse than they were before Leahy
began. Also, the Chief Engineer reports that “ the limit
of reduction has already been passed, and the expendi-
ture may have to be raised if we have years of excessive
or even normal rainfall.” Further—
“ The average age of the lines is increasing, and has
not yet reached the limit at which renewals of timber will
approach a maximum, so that it will be increasingly diffi-
cult in the future to keep down the cost of maintenance
under this, one of the heaviest items of expenditure.”
This policy of borrowing to carry out public works,
and then borrowing more to keep the public works
going, has landed Queensland in a bog. It has a huge
public debt and no sinking fund, and now it is likely to
find that all its present sources of revenue are required
to prop up the lines sufficiently to carry traffic. The
same thing is happening in the Mechanical Engineer’s
department: “ if the traffic had remained normal the
greatest difficulty would have been found in handling it
with the present stock of locomotives.” So far
Australia, with its consuming thirst for railways, has
travelled on the plea that you couldn’t expect new
lines to pay from the jump, but that, if you waited
awhile, they would be all right; it forgot,
what it was just as necessary to remember,
that even if traffic increased expenses wouldn’t be long
in increasing too. Now the fact is coming home that
what was forgotten is more of an absolute certainty than
what was remembered; for, unfortunately, there isn’t
any certainty about traffic increasing, while no sort of
engine, or sleeper, or rail has yet been invented that
won’t wear out, and cost more for repairs and renewals in
the 10th year than it did in the first. .

It will probably turn out that not a penny of
the insurances on the foundered steamer Ovalau was laid-
off at Lloyd’s. A cable message mentioned that re-
insurances had been effected at 25 guineas premium ; bub
that was only a “ doctor’s ” quotation. At the time it
was offered the interested co’s. would have laughed at
that price.

The trouble with the N.S.W. State clothing
factory and the Railway Commissioners, though tem-
porarily settled against the factory, is not yet done with.
The Commissioners called for tenders for the supply of
railway men’s uniforms for 1904, and as a private ten-
derer cut under the State factory by 25 percent., they
stated that they had no option but to let him the con-
tract. Last year the State factory contracted at 21s. a
suit. The lowest outside price was 20s. This year, with
wages firmer, materials dearer, and the uniforms required
being of equal quality, the factory again tendered at 21s.
The successful tenderer, if the Railway Commissioners
are correct, undertakes to supply trousers, vest, and coat
for 15s. 9d. Experts maintain that, barring sweating and
inferior turn out, the uniforms cannot be supplied at
15s. 9d. The successful tenderer’s shops will be closely
watched for sweating, and the style and fit of the uni-
forms undergo a sharp inspection, and if the firm which
has the contract makes it pay, the rest of the tailoring
trade will have learnt something.

The Heddon-G-reta Coal Co. (Newcastle) is still
largely in the development state,'and a large amount of
the expenditure is charged to development account.
Until it is proved what this work is really worth it is im-
possible to say whether operations are profitable or other-
wise. About all that can yet be stated definitely with
regard to the co.’s progress follows:
Total Deficit
Charged (apart from
Coal Land to De- Develop-
Sales. Sales, velopment. ment).
Mar., 1902 .. £504 £1798 £i9sl
Oct., 1902 .. 2983 £668 4888 1247
Mar., 1903 .. 4290 1685 5692 521
Oct., 1903 .. 8599 94 7573 380
The deficit includes moneys paid for flotation expenses,
which are not reckoned as an asset. The paid capital is
£42,550. Debentures for £lO,OOO have been issued, and
an overdraft for £2051 has been contracted. The most
satisfactory feature is the rapid increase in coal output.

The row between Potter and the Broken Hill
Prop., the holders of the two best-known chemical pro-
cesses for the recovery of a zinc product, is still on ; it
will get into the N.S.W. Supreme Court presently.
Potter’s patent application was for an acid process ; he
fed the acid (any acid; even lemon-juice would do if
lemons were cheap enough) into the zinc-bearing pulp,
and the zinciferous portion rose as a scum. Delprat’s
application was for a salt cake (sulphuric acid) process ;
and Potter claims that that was covered by his applica-
tion—that and every other acid. As to the zinciferous
product, it is said to be worth £5 a ton at the Australian
seaboard. As Block 14 seems to have secured the right
to use Potter’s process, and is. now building a plant for
the purpose (the first on a commercial scale), it has been
supposed that this co. was interested in the patent ; but
it isn’t. The interest in it that Potter (a Victorian metal-
lurgist) doesn’t own belongs to the biggest of Melbourne
newspaper men and a Vic. M.L.O. This accounts for the
toughness of the fight which is being made against the
B.H. Prop.—a fight which the co. probably didn’t reckon
on when it first took un the business.
• * * *
B.H. Junction North gob ready to restart its
ramshackle mill when lead went to £l2, but the start did
not take place, and it is not likely to for some time to
come. Except for a very little while the co. was
probably never able to produce metal at under £l3, and
no developments of much importance have taken place
in the mine. Probably it will be able to make a trifle
some day by selling its large heap of zinc-bearing
tailings, but its best hope lies in amalgamation with the
Junction, to which its fine main shaft would be a
valuable asset. The co.’s cash balance is about £2600.
* * * *
“ M.C.” on the need for giving the zinc industry
a lift (B.* Oct. 18): Not only can a zinc concentrate be
produced cheaply and laid down at the smelter at a very
low price, but enormous quantities of waste fine coal can be
utilised in zinc treatment. Under present conditions local
works would have to compete with the cheapest labor in
Europe, working on Broken Hill ore. A bonus on zinc and
an export duty on zinc oi e would start an industry, and
galvanising would follow as a natural result. When the
time arrives that Broken Hill threatens to shut down (in
a few years’ time, possibly), then will the folly be realised
of fostering German industry .at the expense of our own.
The same reasoning applies just as much to the manufac-
ture of lead and copper as to zinc smelting. How about
white lead and copper .wire, with the local and Asiatic
markets ? The daily press seems almost violently opposed
to a bonus or an export duty of any kind ; also the Free-
trade section of the Labor party.

The north end of the Kalgoorlie field (W.A.) is
looking better than for a long time past. The Devon
Consols (late Mount Charlotte East) is opening out so
satisfactorily that the proprietors (Oades and Son) have
bought another 15 head of stamps from the Ivanhoe, and
will very shortly have a 25-head mill in full swing. In
the same belt, on the west, several abandoned leases have
been pegged by such knowing prospectors as Jenkinson,
Davis, and Oliver Hancock. Hancock was the prospector
of the North Lead, Kanowna, and the Adeline Lead, Kal-
goorlie, and also discovered the lode on the Eclipse,
which is now giving such satisfactory returns. Appa-
rently a revival may shortly be looked for in a district
that has long been nearly dead
* * * *
Golden Horseshoe, Kalgoorlie (W.A.), appears
determined to lead the van of the State’s gold-producers.
Not content with having 670,000 tons of 25dwt. ore in sight,
and a great deal more not fully blocked out, instruc-
tions have been issued to sink the shaft to 2000 ft. and
open up another 10 levels, and so increase the reserves to
eight years’ supply for the mill. The shaft is down about
1100 ft., and is being sunk at the rate of 35ft. monthly,
and this can easily be improved upon if thought
necessary. According to the diamond drill the
No. 4 lode, which was reported to have gone
into Great Boulder’s ground, is only 47ft. east of the
shaft at 1300 ft. as against 183 ft. east at 900 ft., so that it
has a very distinct westerly underlay into Horseshoe
ground. The prospects of the mine, in fact, never looked
better. The foundations of the new 50-head mill are now
in course of construction, but it is not expected to make
a start till well on in the new year. The mine is again
heading the list of producers, its October product in fine
gold reading 15,3050 z. against Great Boulder Perse-
verance’s 14,3250 z.

Captain Pleitner holds fast to his statement
that the Cumberland, Norseman (W.A.), reef will not pan
out more than an average of Joz. to the ton. Previously
it was said here that Pleitner found the reef barely 2ft.
wide ; but he is willing to allow that, though the reef
was only 2ft. wide in the widest part in Monday’s shaft,
in the other (Hall’s) it might he 4ft., though in some
places it is, he asserts, difficult to trace any lode at all.
Anyhow, the mill is beginning to talk now, and so the
controversy ought soon to settle itself. -
• * * *
Murchison Associated, Day Dawn (W.A.), is
getting a move on after being muddled for something-
like eight years. The old 10-head mill has been removed
from the Polar Star lease, a mile away, and re-erected on
the Rubicon, together with a cyanide plant bought from
the defunct Fingall Proprietary, and a new 12-drill air
compressor. The new main shaft on the Rubicon is being
hurried, and when this has been completed, it is proposed
to erect a brand-new 40-head mill. In the meantime ore
to keep the old mill in work will be drawn through the
old underlay shaft. This shaft is only down 350 ft. verti-
cal, which fact doesn’t say much for the Bewic.k-Moreing
control. When the shaft reaches 500 ft. vertical it will be
connected by a crosscut with the new main shaft. This
work will take several months to complete.
* * * *
White Feather Reward, Kanowna (W.A.),
after being unsuccessfully worked by the co. for nine
years, is to be offered to tributors.. In the very early
days—about the end of 1895—a 10-stamp mill got to work
and produced an average of 2Joz. to the ton ; but it is by
no means certain that some of the tons didn’t run to
about 80owt. Naturally the costs were very high, and, in
spite of the tall “average,” the co. went bung, and has
been in a chronic state of collapse ever since. A couple
of years ago £14,000 cash was raised to sink a new main
shaft to cut the reef at 500 ft. The reef was cut all right,
but the gold contents were practically nil; hence the
present fiasco. The mine never was any good, and
should have been labelled a wild cab long ago and
abandoned.
• * • •
Queensland Menzies (W.A. ), so far as is ascer-
tainable, is not in the position that one would judge
from the slump in the scrip. Returns have certainly
fallen away somewhat; for the rest, the movement has
been in sympathy with the Lady Shenton, which may
probably be abandoned soon. The Shenton is, however,
quite a 'mile south of the Queensland. The district has
always been patchy T , all the other mines on the line of
lode, such as Lady Sherry, Crusoe, Friday, Florence and
Alpha only yielding occasional dabs. During its eight
years career, the Menzies co. has distributed 14s. a share,
or £92,400, of which 3s. a share, or £19,800, has been
paid this year. The mill will shortly be doubled, and,
unless manager Ferguson’s statements and estimates are
hopelessly wrong, the mine is good for some time yet.
As, however, the deepest workings are only about 500 ft.,
people are not unnaturally nervous, as it was about this
depth that the Lady Shenton petered out. Somebody
must have turned on the tap pretty freely to have
knocked out the market to the tune of 50 per cent.
* * * *
South Kalgurli (W.A.) is now said to have a
dump of 40,000 tons of tailings, estimated to be worth
lOdwt. per ton instead of nil, as formerly asserted. If
this estimate is correct, it shows a very big leakage, and
would fully account for the very short shrift accorded
the Riecken process on Boulder 1. It is freely asserted
that all the despised dumps of residues, now covering the
various leases, will sooner or later suffer retreatment.
Anyway the mine is likely to get a much better show in
the future than it has had in the past, and may yet pay
divs.
• * * *
Devon Consols, Kalgoorlie (W.A.), has recently
struck several very rich dabs in driving south at
the 160 ft. level. This level has been opened up for over
700 ft., and, though the ore is low grade on the whole,
these rich patches, ranging up to 500 oz. in one bunch,
make the mine a highly payable proposition. The
property is now equipped with 25 head of stamps pur-
chased from the Ivanhoe and capable of treating 2500 tons
monthly. This should help to increase the Kalgoorlie
returned to a fair extent. Some of the adjoining shows
on the west and north, abandoned by Adelaide co’s, but
lately repegged, look like proving a success ; that held by
Davis has already yielded a 15dwt. crushing, with
6dwt. in the tailings. All these properties are situated
to the north-east of the Mt. Charlotte, and, though long
in the hands of co.’s, were very poorly prospected.
* * * »
Hannan’s Reward, Mt. Charlotte (W.A.), after
four reconstructions, looks very like being at the end of
its tether. Manager Nutman, also manager of the North
Kalgurli, has announced his resignation of the former
show, on the plea that the latter requires all his energies.
The Reward claim, barring producing an enormous
amount of alluvial gold, has all along proved an expen-
sive duffer. It is a good tributing, or working-man’s,
show, but is absolutely valueless for a highly capitalised
Bull co., and the; sooner Bull recognises it the better for
his pocket. The closing down of the mine may be looked
for.
• * * t *
Queen Margaret, Bulong (W. A.), is now in the
hands of tributors, and fossickers have so niuch faith in
its possibilities that close on 60 men are at work chasing
the nimble’weight. It is a mine of vast possibilities for
the working miner, as pockets of several hundreds of
ounces are not infrequent, and there is nothing that some
miners appreciate more than the chance of a fortune on a
stroke of the pick. With this continual drag off its back,
the co. may be able to make a mine of the South Gipps-
land show, of which manager Henderson still appears
very confident. Most recent crushings have not fulfilled
expectations; but, naturally, excuses are forthcoming
for the tailing-off of returns, and everything is to be
right when the extra 5 head of stamps and the cyanide
plant are s'- 1 - going.

Two of Ballarat’s best-known co.’s, the
Britannia United and the Last Chance United, which
have been using bad language to each other over the
back fence for years, have now decided to continue their
row where the public can hear it. The Britannia accuses
the Last Chance of stealing its gold, and demands £20,000
damages and an account of the working of certain
ground, which it says the Last Chance has wrongfully
removed. It is the biggest row that Victoria has had
since Bendigo enjoyed a famous quarrel over 20 years ago.

For 1903, Charters Towers will rank a good
second among Australian goldfields, with Bendigo third.
As near as can be stated (the gold value of some of the
Towers’ cyanide bullion being uncertain) the two fields
stood as follows at the end of September
Gold Dividends. Calls.
Charters Towers .. 240,6000 z. £319,250 £98,400
Bendigo .. .. 163,4760 z. 216,622 102,346
But, in the matter of profit, Gympie leads both, paying
£ll6s. 6d. in dividends for every ounce won. It is a
coincidence that the others’ figures work out at £1 6s. 6d.
each.
* * * »
In the last three months the 40 Charters Towers’
quoted stocks have shrunk nearly £29o,ooo—from
£2,355,000 to £2,070,000. The smaller concerns have
suffered most; 50 per cent, slumps have been common
enough. The Victoria group's disaster was the worst; a
typical case is the Victoria G.M.’s crash from £28,125 to
£lO,OOO. Marshall’s Queen, Mills, and the Rubies have
been among the slaughtered On the other hand, nearly
all the Brilliant stocks, the Queen Cross Reef and the
Queen Central Block have more than held their price.
Queen Cross Reef, at close on £650,000, is reckoned by
the market to be worth twice as much aS the Brilliant
Central, and five times as much as any other mine on the
field. The Brilliant Central and the Q.C. Reef have the
same area— 25 acres—but the Q.C. Reef has lately given
about five times the other’s return. It has not the
“ life ’’ of the Brilliant Central, though ; and at present
rates buyers will probably not get their money back.

One of Charters Towers’ most characteristic
stickers has just thrown up the sponge—the No. 1 West
Victoria. Its solid struggle lasted 14 years. The original
co. having exhausted all its capital, it was reconstructed,
and shareholders used to look for ha’penny call notices as
regularly as for the full moon. From first to last the
block (between Clark’s Worcester and Victory and the
Victoria) gave 23 small crushings.

Nobody but the debenture-holders got anything
out of Ohillagoe (N.Q.) in the last half-year. The mines
themselves made a heavy loss ; the railway gave £18,530
above costs, and after paying interest on cost, about
£7BOO remained. In spite of that, however, the co.’s net
loss on its whole undertaking was £l5OO.

The Universal Brotherhood and Theo-

Following sundry oilier shocked Justices,
His Honor A’Beckett, of Victoria, lately raged at
great length over the perjury committed by some-
body in a case of arson charged against a striking
Outtrim miner. Seeing that several persons flatly
contradicted each other as to one particular wit-
ness’ actions, there undoubtedly was perjury, but
when the 12 men in the box, by acquitting the
accused, indirectly but unanimously branded some
of the Crown witnesses as the perjurers, his Honor
quite forgot to use the power he had to commit
any of those persons for their crime. Also the
Crown itself has so far failed to file an indictment.
That is why the average citizen sticks his tongue
in his cheek when a Judge rails against perjury.
It is only the accused person’s perjury that is such
a heinous offence; the Crown witness’ prevari-
cation is a mere trifle.
The manufacture of new religions never
ceases in Canterbury (M.L.), the home of so many
freaky faddists and lily-winged purists with a tin
halo and a collection bag. Latest thing in the
way of home-made worship there is the “Cyclists
Church,” started by Professor Bickerton, formerly
of Canterbury College, in his own picturesque
grounds located a little way from the city. His
show is largely visited on Sunday afternoons,
mostly by the young man in the sweater, accom-
panied by tbe typical nice girl, who stroll over
lawns of green carpet, and repose in the grateful
shade of odorous trees. The service is something
of a cross between a pair of scissors and a hair-
restorer. The tiresome maunderings and groan-
ings about sin, the flesh, and the chap down below
are cut out, and bright sacred and secular music,
a little prayer, cheerful lecturettes on cleanliness
and godliness and the ethics of exercise, and
afternoon tea are substituted. Members of the
“church” pay so much a term; visitors, 6d. a
time. It is a fine, poetic, breezy, soul-satisfying
way of spending the middle part of Sunday, and
the show is likely to evoke many base imitations.

| ?It was recently proposed that St. Kilda
(Melb.) council should start a movement among
the metropolitan councils for the levying of a
charity rate of one half-penny in the &. The idea
was rejected with great speed, one grocer person
getting off the memorable remark that “the

hasn’t—but the aged person who so badly needs

It is a hard life to be a professional sympathiser,
who is all broken up with grief about the death

That unseemly shindy among the directors
of the Watchman, which ended in Parson Madg-
wick being cast out by his fellow boss-Orangemen,
who appointed another director in his stead, is a
curious instance of the parson’s idea of doing busi-
ness. Shareholders are supposed to appoint and
remove directors, and only a body of parsonical
directors would begin expelling each other in this
off-hand fashion. Of late, the Scarlet Woman has
been having something of a rest, and Parson Dill
Macky hasn’t shouted to any extent worth men-
tioning about the errors of Rome. Rome always
gets a bit ahead when the Orangemen start to
skull-drag each other. Pius X., it is reported,
invited his three sisters to dine with him, the
other day—an innovation that almost amounts to
revolution —and he wouldn’t have dared to do
such a thing if the Watchman’s eye hadn’t been
temporarily off him.
It is about “ up to ” the Aus-

it on a few trips to S Africa to
fetch back gratis, on cheap
steerage principles, the starv-
ing Australians who have
got lost in that land of Jews I
and boodle. It could be A
done for about the
price of a statue to
Queen Victoria,
and it would be
a much more use-
ful monument.

To leave so
much valuable

walking about,
lost and desti-

is sheer waste. The
Jingo papers helped
to send these people to
their doom by their lying assurances
that Britain was fighting to bring light
and education and freedom and prosperity
to the country; the emigrants took their
word for it, and went to enjoy the blessings
which were assured as soon as the Boer was ex-
tinguished. Therefore these papers should help
the movement. There are hundreds of men in
S’Africa now who badly want to get back—if only
to tell the Agegus and the S.M. Telehekald
people what sort of people they are.

Colonel-Senator Jawbone Neild made cer-
tain of at least one vote for the Senate the other
night. He and JMajor-Senator Nancy Gould had
gone together to some military affair or other and
were not given the precedence proper to their
allowance of military rooster-feathers, or their
senatorial rank or something, and went away in a
huff. They got down to the A.B.C. Caf4 for some
slight refreshment. Mr. Gould wore a grey coat
over his beautiful millinery, but Mr. Neild
flaunted his flagrant get-up unabashed—and the
gleam of his scarlet and silver and gold dazzled
the room as he threw off a chic thing in
the way of military cloaks, of dark purple
with orange-silk lining. There were several
ladies—mostly of the milliner type or thereabouts
—in the room, and Colonel-Senator Neild’s frills,
and torchon lace, and his chifton, and his passe-
menterie edged with oriental embroidery and
paillettes of cut-steel, finished off with a little
guipure, deeply impressed them, and Colonel-
Senator Neild took as long as he possibly
could to consume sixpence worth of food.
Then he made great work of resuming the
Persian rug thing that he wore over his point
lace and his artillery—such great work that one
of the womenfolk, fascinated with his mag-
nificence, rose and humbly helped the great man
on with his drapery. An ordinary man would
have been confused. But Jawbone Neild is no
ordinary man. “ I thank you, madam,” he said,
bowing deeply, “I thank you” (taking off hi 3
forage cap, in defiance of regulation A210|) ; ‘‘l
thank you. I can assure you, it is the most dis-
tinguished compliment I have ever had paid to
me in my life.” And the Colonel-Senator swag-
gered out. That poor little woman would go
through a field of mice now to vote for him at the
Senate elections, and would battle with wild cock-
roaches in his defence.

A pretty picture of rural delights is mixed
up with recent news of harvest prospects in S.
Australia. ‘‘The crops,” says the local corres-
pondent, “are looking splendid, and the farmers
are in high spirits ’’ ; and that reminds him. A
young farmer, doing well and thinking of soon
setting up a dairy of his own, was having the
usual Saturday-night stroll with the usual girl.
Walking along a lane hedged with spreading
acacias, they fell over a bull, and the young man
impaled his pants on the bull’s horn. The.animal
left hurriedly, taking the young man with it. The
young man yelled and tried to climb down. The
girl he left behind him shrieked. Finally the
young man was brushed off the bull as the latter
burst through a gate, but the beast went away
with the pants. This is one of the horrors of a
good season in S.A.; the grass is so tall that
lovers come on concealed bulls quite unexpectedly.
In bad years a bull can be seen on the bare earth
three miles off.

Melbourne lately struck the beginnings of
what will either be a notable farce or a gigantic
law case. Plaintiff—a pleasant-lookmg lady of
nice manners—name 3 two score of defendants,
including Iceberg Irvine, Justice A’Beckett, a
bank, a dozen lawyers, and several well-known
city firms, and charges them with robbery, forgery,
perjury, outlawry, boycotting, blackmailing,
bribery, and the passing of fraudulent accounts.
She came before Justice Hood, on a summons for
directions, and ran her part of the show quietly
and sensibly, incidentally getting his Honor to
administer a healthy snub to a member of the
Upper House. Said person, who is one of
the defendants, desired the Judge to sum-
marily strike out the case as farcical, but was
informed that thev didn’t do things in that court
after the fashion of the Upper House-the law
wasn’t going to be bustled for all the Landlords
in creation ; there were costs, and things would
be done decently and in order, with costs, of
course. So a statement of claim is to be furnished
and the matter is to be argued gradually and with
due regard to dignity.

I stepped in to ask the meaning of the sign. The owner
of the boot-hospital seemed surprised at my ignorance,
and, pitying my lack of education, explained that the
spider-legged characters read: “Bring y°u r , r . e P a i r ? 1 j
here, he does them cheap.” I sneered, told him In an

kept by an alleged white man. It had three Chinese
characters written on the window in whiting. I presume
they meant that puppy-dog, or some such luxury. on
the menu. Went farther along, and stopped to discuss
preferential trade with a livery-stable proprietor. Glanced
into the yard, and saw a white man loading a Chow s cart
with manure. The keeper of the horse boarding-house
said that the white man was regularly employed Dj our
yellow brother. Tried to get up on the .fence to hooray
for a white Australia, but a policeman pointed to a notice,
“ Billstickers beware,” so I desisted. I didn t go anj

If the N.S.W. Government had gone out
last week it would have had the credit of making
a bright remark in its last moments. Dr. Ross,
M.L.A., put on the notice paper one of his usual
frantic questions; he wanted to know, in effect,
what was the cause of weather. And the Minister
replied that he had heard that God had something
to do with it.
TEE IMPROVED DOG.
“ Why, what’s the matter with poor Fido?"
“ Isn’t it just too bad, dear? I gave him to the
laundress to wash, and she starched him.”
Etiquette seems to be a thing of some size
at Rome. The new Pope has broken up a
mouldy precedent by inviting his three
sisters, the Miss Popes, to dinner, and his Head
Chamberlain, after vainly remonstrating, is
reported to have wept bitterly. Hitherto, it
seems, the Pontiff has never dined with anybody;
in the dead weight of his size and pomp he has
been expected to moon over his lonesome egg in
blank solitude. To be the only Pope in the
world, quite unable to rush out and hunt up two
or three other Popes when he felt lonely, and
then to have his loneliness rubbed in by not
being even allowed to ask a Cardinal to have
a snack with him, has apparently been too much
for Pius X., and he has rebelled. Pomp, when you
come to think of it, is very much like solitary
confinement without the option. Some of the
old Persian kings went mad for want of the sight
of an ordinary perpendicular human being; their
subjects all fell down when spoken to, and the
King of Kings went through life seeing only the
backs of horizontal grovellers till he began to see
visions as well. The old Jap emperors had a habit
of' going mad too. The old Jap emperor travelled
in a dark, closed-in coach lest he should be defiled
by a common person looking at him, and at home
in his palace he was expected to sit all day in his
chair of state with courtiers in a humble attitude
round him on the floor. He did this because the
vastness of his own mind was supposed to make
him independent of all ordinary amusement. A
species of tent was provided in his hall of state,
and when he felt extra miserable he retired there
and cheered himself up by sitting alone in the
gloom with his awful majesty for company. On
the whole, The Bulletin feels glad that the Pope
has asked his sisters to dine with him, so that he
can have his tea poured out for him like an
ordinary human being.

One beneficent side issue of the Arbitration
laws in Maori land has been to knock out most of
the enthusiasm from Eight-Hour Day and similar
demonstrations. In the old days the unions had
to impress the crowd with their strength and their
solidity; so once a year they threw out their
chests and trailed along behind a quantity of
painted bunting. But painted bunting doesn’t
count these times, when one argument is more
powerful than six banners and two drums ; so the
disposition is to stay at home and think up argu-
ments to heave at the Arbitration Court and let
the Salvarmy have a monopoly of the banner and
the trombone business.
Manager Teece, of the A.M.P. Society,
has had a new taste of socialism, and he owns
that he liked it. While he was in Westralia he
stayed at the Gwalia State p»ib. “It is a
splendid hotel,” he says, “and I think it was an
excellent move on the part of the Government to
establish it there.” But this admission of the
success of Public Enterprise evidently made Mr.
Teece uneasy, for he hurried on to add that,
of course, the scheme would break down if
applied on a large scale—in a city, for instance.
“Government supporters would perhaps make
it a condition of their support that the Govern-
ment should purchase liquor from some of their
clients, and thereforeone does not know what would
be foisted on the public.” Tjp to now, nobody
has suggested that Government supporters have
made it a condition of their support that the
Postmaster-General should give their clients the
run of the telegraph office ; and if any attempts
have been made by merchants to get their goods
carried for nothing on the railways in return for
political support, they apparently haven’t come
off. And why the liquor business should not be
as honestly managed as the post and telegraphs
and the railways, or as the Maoritand Life Assur-
ance Department, or the law courts, or the patents
office, or a hundred other things, Mr. Teece doesn’t
mention.

There are good times ahead for the devil’s
brigade in Melbourne. The great Heaity case is
to be argued again before the Full Court. This is
the case that occupied C. J. Madden for 43 days a
while back, his judgment consisting of 1000 folios
and taking many hours to deliver. And the costs
will, as before, be monumental. An idea thereof
may be gained from the appeal books delivered to
the associate ; they are four, beautifully bound,
and comprising 7984 folios altogether. Vol. 1
contains pleadings, reasons for judgment,
judgment and supplementary judgments; vol. 2,
evidence and depositions; vol. 3, exhibits and
documents ; vol. 4, correspondence. The appeal
is expected to last three weeks, at the end of
which time there will probably be precious little
of the estate left to fignt for.

The Harbor Trust offices, recently opened
on Circular Quay, Sydney, ocoupy an historic
site. Something like 100 years ago surgeon
Thomas Jamison lived on the spot, it being
then a water-frontage. In Macquarie’s time
it passed into the hands of Mrs. Mary
Reibey, the lady who was not Margaret
Catchpole. Next door, north, Isaac
Nichols, the Postmaster, had his resi-
dence and office, and later on, a little
further north, the famous Rum
Puncheon public-house, frequented by
whaling men, lived in an atmo-
sphere of rum, whale oil, and early-
day profanity.
Candidate Alexander Hay, defeated the
other day at Glen Innes (N.9.W.), affects the
English system of landlord and tenant in his
farming business, and when he was in a tight
place at Glen Innes, tenant A. Woods rushed all
the way from the Berry estate to assure the voters
that it is due to Mr. Hay’s generosity that he (Woods)
and neighbors have now happy homes, and are in a pros-
perous, independent way of living.
“ Generosity ” has the real old Hinglish ring about
it. The properly-instructed Hinglish peasant
considers it is by his landlord’s “ generosity ” he
is allowed to live at all. Generous squires who
graciously permit their tenants to exist in con-
sideration of paying a high rent to the useless
parasites at the head of affairs, and wormy tenants
who learn to pour the grease of adulation over the
landlord for fear they should get their rent raised,
are twin evils.

N.S.W. Attorney-General Wise has done
another bad turn to the newspapers by quashing
the prosecution of those three persons accused
of conspiring together to force a man “ to marry
the girl.” The trial would have had a healthy
influence on various circulations. The “society”
column of the D.T. gave the first news to the
world of the marriage—describing it as a “quiet
and interesting” affair, at which “the bride wore
a travelling costume” and “only relatives were
present.” Later, the bridegroom called on the
police to allege that he wore a sprinting costume
(having been dragged to the ceremony as he
endeavored to escape) and a worried look. And
now the public is refused further information
about that quiet wedding, which the bridegroom
alleged was quiet principally because he was
afraid of being killed if he shouted for assistance.
It is not known whether prosecutor is proceeding
with his suit for nullity of marriage. If he is,
then the evening papers may get their harvest
after all—but the delay is aggravating.

Anyone except Josiah Symon might have
been badly taken aback at an incident in Adel-
aide police-court last week. The K.C., defending
in a tote shop prosecution, made much fun of last
year’s Lottery and Gaining Act. “I don’t know
who drafted it,” he said. Police-magistrate
Gordon smiled sweetly and said “I did ! ” Symon
never turned a hair. “In that case,” he said,
“it must be the tinkering of the Legislature that
accounts for its present ridiculous condition.”
But the Act held together well enough to get
Josiah’s client a nearly-record fine of £5O.

Consider the
widely divergent
tactics of local
creeds in regard
to the manner
in which they
carry out their
annual picnics.
The Pres b y-
terians invite all
and sundry, en-
gage traps (and
pay for them) to
cart all-comers to
the rendezvous,
a green spot
three miles out;
give three
“blow-outs”—
viz., at 2 p.m.,
4.30 p.m., and 7
p.m. ; take no
payment what-
ever, and ask
you how you
enjoyed yourself.
They make it a .
point to give the
poorer folks pre-
ference over every-
body else. The
Anglicans collect
from their own
“ color ” only, but
invite all and sundry
(you find 3’our own con-
veyance), and give you
a “blow-out” after
their own lot have
been satisfied. The
Methodists collect
from all and sundry
in the town, and
charge strangers
Is. each at
“ blow-out ”
time, which is
once, at 6 p.m.
They carry their
own people to
the grounds,
and any others they
can’t dodge. Don’t care whether you enjoy your-
self or not—if not, that’s your own look out.
Sing two hymns and grace before the devasta-
tion begins. The Catholics collect from their own
people, and invite everybody who cares to come. If
you stay away they like you better. Their own people
help themselves. Strangers are waited on, especially the
financial friends who help when a bazaar is in the air.
To get out to the picnic ground you hang on by your
eyebrow behind Tim or Mick’s family conveyance, which
is filled to the splash-boards, and shout for the driver and
occupants at the first pub you pass! The Salvarmy
people collect from everybody twice over, when possible,
and issue tickets at so-much a piece to all who don’t
wear Army uniform. They borrow vehicles and charge
“ fares ” to the meeting place—give you one poor meal of
home-made pastry, sing a hymn in between the mouth-
fuls, and take up two collections.

N.S.W. Judge Rogers last week sentenced
two pretty sisters, aged about 21, to two and years
imprisonment respectively (with a prospect of
release after six months if security for their good
behavior was forthcoming) for a series of thefts
from houses where they were employed. One
probable reason why his Honor fell with rather
an extra hard thud on the accused was that they
had resumed their course of larceny while out on
bail awaiting trial. The fact of being on bail
should be a sufficiently broad hint to any good-
looking girl, and this resumption of hostilities, so
to speak, at such an inappropriate time, naturally
made the Law arch its back somewhat.

“H.”: Nothing has interested me so
much for a long while as the Tit-Bits account of
its buried treasure. A tale called “Hidden, Not
Lost,” has been running in its pages. Assur-
ance was given that the Tit-Bits proprietary had
planted 500 sovereigns in an accessible spot, to
which unerring clues would be given in the story.
Acting on these, Hubbard, an engineer, of Leices-
ter, found the money, and Gowan, a Glasgow
attorney, narrowly missed it. The swag was in
two long, metal cylinders, each containing 250
sovs. Newnes, jun., and the novelist buried it
near Hitchin, in Hertfordshire. They went to the
place a week later and could not find the plant!
This was through a slight error in measurement,
duly rectified in the explanations of the tale.
Thousands of people have been bashing their
brains and wondering how they missed seeing a
thing that was quite obvious. It is remarkable
what a variety of interruptions both the hiders
and finder met with in a lonely spot.
Westralia has the habit of appointing
medical men as resident magistrates out back ;
the man who has given you something to pull you
together in the morning after you have painted
the township more than ordinarily red will, later
on, fine you 50s. for doing it. The plan gives
Mulgaville both a doctor and a magistrate, and
it couldn’t afford either if they had to be two
men ; and generally it works out all right except
when somebody takes it into his head to appeal.
Then as a rule the best thing is to take the
magistrate’s notes to the chemist and let him
make up the prescription. Most times only a
chemist can read a doctor’s writing.
THE BROWN HAIRS ON MY COAT.

Before the mirror in the hall
There is a deed I do,
For io 1 the girl warm tresses wears
That covertly I woo,
And O I the woman is a Fiend,
That I am married to.
Therefore I stand and scan the glass,
As any maiden might;
And from my shoulder I remove
The brown hairs shining bright;
And O ! the cat doth rub my shins —
The cat that walks by night.
For she from whose dear head they come,
What time we cling and kiss,
Is, in the desert of my life,
The one green oasis.
And I would rather lose my soul
Than lose that bit of bliss I
For she is only twenty—see ;
And I am forty—note :
The bond between is fatherly,
Just tinged with table d’hote !
Ah 1 ’tis my life’s one joy to pick
Those brown hairs from my coat !

Tired, tear-worn eyes look up and smile,
When God’s sweet sunshine stealeth through
Once in a while.

Grew in clusters near her head ;
Alice in her snow-white gown,
Reached a crimson blossom down,
Lingering there beside the creek
Heard a step, and to her cheek,
Crept the blush of roses red,
As she slowly turned her head ;
And encountered eyes of grey,
Where love held undivided sway.
What he asked, what Alice said,
None heard, save roses white and red.

A WOMAN’S LETTER.
Sydney, November 3, 1903.
Mr Deab Arini.—
Two dress horrors that women thought were
dead and buried threaten resurrection. They are
the starched white linen collar and the crinoline.
In fact the first is in vogue already m New York
and Paris ; the latter is yet in embryo, as a single
circle of crinoline wire round the foot of the dress.
It will probably develop no further, for women of
to-day are more aesthetic than were their crinoline-
wearing forbears. As for the collar, it will be the
cause of more work for the beauty doctors,
for it was chiefly on their advice that women gave
up some three or four years ago, wearing linen
chokers, which coarsened the cuticle, impoverished
the muscles ' and caused a broad brown mark
around the throat. 1 saw one of the new linen
collars on an arrival by the Ventura last trip. It
fastened at the back, and was collar and stock all
in one. The stock took root at the top of the
collar under the wearer’s chin, and lay on her
chest in hour-glass shape. It was worn with a
tailor-made of thin tweed. Another threatened
revival—this time a picturesque one—is the jersey.
Judging by the pictures of jersey women, it will
give good figures a great show.
Whilst talking dress—why haven’t Sydney
dressmakers got the little Yankee notion known
as the skirt gauge ? I have seen a poor skirt-titter
kneel for nearly 20 minutes on the floor and get a
rush of blood to the intellect, and the fitted one
like to faint with weariness, while the skirt
was being gauged six inches from the ground all
round. Securing a perfectly even, round skirt
is more difficult than most persons think.
Some women have an “advanced” figure or one
hip ever so slightly higher than its sister, and
every inequality shows in the hang of a skirt.
The skirt gauge takes the measurement in a few
minutes. Woman to be fitted stands erect whilst
the fitter runs the gauge around the end of the
skirt, an indicator marking the height with chalk
all the way.
Some day, perhaps, after we who live now are
all dead, this great country will start to hold
flower feasts as they do in Persia, India and
Japan; and the people of the yet-to-be wdl
have all the fun. Someone writing in 0.M.r1.
entreats the horticulturists of Sydney to wake
up and hold a general exhibition of flowers
and plants, and publish such fruits and vege-
tables as are in season. It is rather late to do
anything in the way of a big floral exhibition
this year, except, perhaps, for a lightning
organiser. The reign of the roses is sq nearly
over. At present the Royal Horticultural
Society holds three shows a year—daffodils in
August, chrysanthemums in the autumn, roses in
October; but it says that the larger, general ex.
cannot be undertaken for lack of support and
scarcity of funds. Well, the hospitals at
present are being very badly supported. Prince
Alfred Hospital, for instance, is passing through
what the newspapers call “ a very critical time.
In June last its income was £832 less than at the
same period the previous year, while the expendi-
ture, despite rigid economy, was .£836 higher.
At this period last year there was a surplus of
nearly £BOO ; to-day there is a deficiency of close
upon £9OO. If a feast of flowers were organised
by capable persons—persons who knew the value
of having pretty society women and actresses, to
sell buttonholes and squashes and wreaths, who
would secure good bands, a kinematograph or
two, and a few other side shows, and hold the
exhibition at the Cricket Ground in aid of the
hospitals, I’m pretty sure an attendance as nume-
rous as that which went to look at the ladies
cricket mateh would result. That same cricket
match drew the people by thousands—grand
stands and lawns were packed, and a clear £5OO
resulted to the theatrioal charities and Children’s
Hospital. Sydney-siders seem glad of any excuse
to rush the Cricket Ground.
The “Feast ” might begin at noon and continue
till near midnight. Teas could be served on the
lawn, and the electric light could shine upon arches
of roses and the beautiful exhibits of our Botanic
Gardens—palms, orchids and ferns, as well as
loan collections from private conservatories!
Why, there’s millions in it! And the Royal
Horti. Soc. might (as the quality of charity isn’t
sieved) co-operate.
Caradoc Kerry, of the lost yacht Ariadne, has
got his £lO,OOO insurance money in London, and an
apology, and much costs. Since the morning Detec-
tives Goulder and Hoskisson fished the little man
out of bed in a boarding-house in Upper Fort-street,
Sydney, he has been more or less on trial. Kerry
is a Maorilander, with sailor boy experiences.
He was in the thick of the first rush to New
Guinea. He started a company which wanted
1,000,000 acres from the authorities of the day.
He started another co. in Brisbane for gold-seeking
alone. He was at that time a mild-faced, ginger-
whiskered enthusiast who looked too innocent for
rough diggers and Papuan cannibals. His next
departure was the opening of an academy in
London —Dashwood House it was called—where
he undertook to teach, for substantial premiums,
the sons of the nobility all the ins and outs ot
Australian gold-mining, which sounds very like
teaching them how to pursue the wild ass theoreti-
cally in Piccadilly. And then came the sailing
yacht Ariadne, her wreck, the bitter wrangling of
himself and Mumford, his captain, the charges of
blackmail and conspiracy, and the collapse of
Mumford, who is about the most remarkable
figure in the whole story.
A correspondent writes to me that Miss Maie
Saqui, well known here with Mr. J.C.W.’s Comic
Opera co’s, was married on September 23rd to
Mr. Hope Travers, of the Grenadier Guards.
Surely the bloque is noble—an heir-apparent, or
something like that; otherwise Maie will not have
married as well as Rosie Boote, who became
Marchioness of Hertford. Singular thing, but
within a few weeks five Gaiety girls were married
to Guardsmen in London. Not one old G.G. is
now left to George Edwardes.
Presentation of a ring to Miss Crossley will be
made to-morrow —“Elijah” night—at the Town
Hall. Presentations to singers nave been remark-
ably rare in Sydney. Melba did not receive any
gift; in fact, since Catherine Hayes, the Irish
songstress, who got a guinea for concert seats here
and in Melbourne well-nigh 50 years ago, no
artist, so far as I can learn, has taken away any-
thing save cash, unless she did it when the public
wasn’t looking. In the case of Catherine Hayes a
magnificent case of jewels was presented on the
eve of her departure from Sydney ; all the not-
abilities of New South Wales contributed to the
testimonial, which was presented in the old Vic-
toria Theatre.
By next Cup day I intend to attempt a little
enterprise. I shall hire a cargo tramp steamer
for the Cup excursion with accommodation for
4000 passengers at 10s. each. Of course my 4000
must bring their own bedding and vittles. On
second thought I shall not travel on my tramp,
because if it were still being rocked on the cradle,
of the deep, owing to engine breakage, whilst, the
Cup was being run, my tramps might break things
—one’s head is breakable. The passengers
wouldn’t be quite of the status of those who went
by the Oceana —they made a diamond show every
night, and wore their Derby frocks at breakfast
and their Cup gowns at lunch.
Some Sydney shopkeepers have been telling a
local paper that this is one of the best seasons
ever experienced for the sale of Cup finery. A
number of 25-guinea dresses have been sold;
many ladies bought five costumes at 18 guineas
each, and one charmer bought six hats at not less
than four guineas each. Now, if she would wear the
whole six at once, there would be something
like a hat show, and she would be certain
of being in all the papers. An evening paper
boldly states that “the following hats were pur-
chased ” by Mrs. Jehoram Jehonadab ; the list is
enumerated, and the Society for the Protection of
Birds will regret to hear that one hat was trimmed
with “a whole bird of Paradise,” and another
with humming-birds’ wings. Mrs. J. J., may not
be able to wear those hats if it rains, or the dress
chroniclers may miss her, but at least the fact that
she has purchased the clothes has been published.
The Ovalau is found —the oinders thereof are
resting at the bottom of the sea. The passengers
and crew are safe above ground, so the only piece
of crape is that tied on the handle of the insurance
office. A Sydney Telegraph man tried to inter-
view Lord Boringdon, one of the Ovalau’s pas-
sengers, whom he found asleep in a bunk on the
rescuing steamer. The young man was disinclined
to give any information. Perhaps he said “Ha_w”
—perhaps he didn’t. It’s not his fault that he is a
lord, and he doesn’t see why he should be pestered
with interviews when he is just doing a holiday
tour. Besides the habit of expecting lords to
fiart with information ought to be discouraged,
n many cases it is like confiscating the widow’s
mite.
A novel floral trophy was given to Miss
Ada Crossley at Adelaide. It was a white
witch-elm wand, having close to the top. a large
cluster of lilies of the valley. From this hung
three white ribbons printed in silver with some
appropriate verse, and finished with three per-
fectly tuned silver bells, bearing the three notes
A, D, A. The top of the wand bore a silver star
about six inches across it, and it made a support
for Miss Crossley when her damaged ankle com-
pelled her to lean upon something.
Nance O’Neil as Rosalind in doublet and hose !
For the first time in her stage career she has
exhibited her extensive figure in tights. It is not
reported that she is any thinner than when in
Sydney. It is difficult to refrain from smiling
when one thinks of the coy command which she
must give to Orlando, “ Come, woo me, woo me ! ”
And did no galleryite advise her to take a fall out
of Charles the wrestler, herself ?
Writes my Melbourne correspondent: —
“ Lad y Tennyson gets off a neat little speech
now and then. One of her best efforts was at the
opening of the Gentlewomen’s Work Association
at Prahran Town Hall, the other day. ‘lndigent
gentlewomen,’ who are skilful with the needle on
plain or fancy fabrics, represent "the good cause
for the society’s championship. Sales at the
stalls were brisk. The impoverished lady, or the
just hard-up society girl (the work of all was
represented in the sale) may thank their stars for
the excellent results of the show. Bibs, now that
babies are fashionable, were snapped up eagerly,
and white collars, cravats, and jabots in point lace
commanded boom prices.
“In the wild rush preceding the junkets last
week, one collided with various groups of females
representing the Australian branch of the National
Council of Women, who were congressing on the
very threshold of the Cup carnival. On Wednes-
day, Lady Silverlocks opened ‘ Stonington ’ to
the thoughtful sisterhood, and turned them out
to grass. The weighty-browed women found it
pleasant to argue and air their gravity on the
shaven sward. High tea and a tall concert
followed that evening. Next day the Congress
settled down into its collar, and set to work on
heavy matters concerning the status of the sex.
How many of the delegates stole away to the Cup,
just to see how wicked it was, I dare not guess.
“On Derby day, the most phlegmatic band of
racegoers on hand occupied the two vice-regal
pens, and wore the quiet hues of a retired life.
'The Gov. -Generaless, cobl of aspect in unremark-
able cream color and black millinery, looked the
typical Englishwoman. Erect of bearing, quiet,
yet confident, ‘correct’ enough in every way
to fill creditably any position in life, she fails
spectacularly, nevertheless, through her lack
of charm, of light and shade, of color.
Readers of Anthony Trollope always recall
his clerical matrons, in connection with
the liege-lady of his Ex. T. According
to Trollope, the parsonage inarms of old England
rise early, look after their children, hear the
junior parish its catechism, and reward it with
horne-baked currant buns. Good, dutiful sort of
women, I take it, who stoop not to be charming
because they say it’s ‘ deceitful.’ When people
like that die, their widowers generally choose
quite different women to succeed them. ‘ Duty
first and pleasure afterwards.’ Her State Ex.
Clarke wore all black; she goes mourning
for that good old man, the clergyman,
her father-in-law. Lady Rawson (N.S.W.) and
Admiraless Fanshawe seemed a dove-quiet
pair in plumage of Quaker grey. The Rawson
daughter, in simple creamy frock, and small pink
roses in a flat hat, took after her unobtrusive
mother. Miss Fanshawe, in the_ simplest of
French grey muslins, is a tall, fair Miss with
sunny hair, and more small talk than the rest of
the group. Mrs. Ewan Frazer was one of the
best-dressed of visiting Sydney-siders. Poor Lord
Dick Neville worked hard to keep things moving,
but in the end left off trying to sparkle, and
devoted his time to pointing out to the Gov.-
General the ought-to-be-noticed, whom he then
chased and retrieved into the vice-regal presence.
“ The Derby parade was up to expectations.
The new dress notions are fashioned much in the
old modes of 1830 and thereabouts. The glories
of several recently returned globe-trotters were
great, notably in the case of Mrs. Pursey Chirn-
side, Mrs. Thornley, Mrs. Stuart Brunton and Miss
M‘Cumming. The first named lady supplemented
her toilette by a big fussy boa of black marabou
feathers—a hot-looking arrangement, albeit latest
London novelty. The millinery of all these
tourists oalled for notice. They all ran to. the
French poke or scoop shape, bordered with minia-
ture rosebuds or overlaid with delicate tiers of
lace. In the more emphatic Dolly Varden
examples and the coquettish chin knots, the
Misse3 Landale were first past the sartorial post.
They were in rainbow-hucd toilettes, fluttering,
fussing, swimming in the skirt parts. There was
a contrasting meagreness of chiffon about their
swan necks.
“ From the show of dresses there are one or two
conclusions to draw. The summer girl must billow,
droop, slope, and must curl her skirt-folds round
her bounteous hips when they are not billowing.
She must have a demure smile-under the shelter
of her slightly poke bonnet. The chic charmer is
no more. Pertness, Sauciness are out-of-fashion
affectations. The summer girl’s complexion, too,
has become a serious care. When it is not set off
by a cunning double mesh guaranteed to beautify,
it must be doctored so subtly that the naked eyes
must only detect a sweet tinge of hoalth —a mere
suggestion of bloom.
“A white linen sac coat, suspiciously like a
night-dress, is being sported by the extra chic.
It has a broad, plain, roomy back, and two side
gaps for sleeves that about complete the illusion.
Strange how one-half the sex runs to the extreme
in fresh-air blouses and a show of flesh tints, while
the other is pretty well starched to the ear-lobe
and encased in an unyielding coat of crash or linen
as hard as a frozen sheep. The golden or decent
mean is grasped by her who dresses in cool, soft
muslins, perforated very slightly about the neck
and wrists. She is the ideal Summer girl whose
presence is a solace.
“The out-door party of the Commandant
Huttons started the whirligig on Friday, and
started it radiantly. Fashionables, Federalists,
star-mummers mingled on the lawn patches, or
took shots at a target in the tennis-court, or looked
on languidly at some fine manoeuvres of a military
body. The hostess, who unfailingly appears in
the most picture-like frocks ever designed for a
matron of weight, wore a sweet rig-out of rose
pink and tender green in one oLthe newgossamery
French muslins. The accompanying head-gear
ran to chip and white plumes and a general air of
half-repressed coquetry. Lady Tennyson, with
her three boys, to say nothing of the Gov.-Gen.,
and a trio of sad aides, drew the creamiest to her
side.
“ Three ex-theatricals starring it at the races
this week are Mrs. Fred and Mrs. Jim M‘Evoy,
and the bride, Mrs. M'Nicol Turner. The two
former practically took the palm for the most
artistic plumage at the Derby. Their outfits
were inspirations in Wedgewood-blue and dove-
grey, with plumed hats in the same tone. The
bride was in white,'exquisite in style and fabric.
The ex-actress has a great advantage over her
sisters who have had no limelight training in
dressing for effect.
“Miss Maud Jeffries has a bijou villa among a
profusion of rose trees in the sunniest corner of
Toorak, and passers-by have glimpses of the
lady as she trails in sad serpentine grey robes,
along the little garden paths, or stands cutting the
rose blooms to vary the picture.
“Those ‘society’ amateurs have ceased from
troubling well people for the sake of sick one 3
(their crimes were committed on behalf of
Women’s, Hospital and Women’s Nursing
Society); but the evil that they did lives after
them in the shape of teasing memories. What
poor singing voices most of them had ! And how
frail and uncertain was their hold upon tune.
Sometimes they took the correct note neatly,
sometimes they were frankly false; mostly
they wobbled wishfully round the air, now
hitting, now missing the proper pitch, as
dancers, the faint-voiced warblers were jbghtly
more expert, the juveniles of the band being
really fleet and frolicsome trippers. The whole ot
them were death on ‘ coons,’ but thats not to oe
wondered at. Stereotyped stage coon-work
demands neither beauty, grace, melody nor
rational enunciation, hence every duffer makes
bold with so-called nigger impersonations
“ That famous singer’s sister, whose engagement
is just announced to a spruce sassiety bachelor,
will, in due course, inherit her share of The
family bawbees. In appearance, she is gittea
with a slight, erect figure, regular features, auburn
hair (always most modestly coiffured) and a
correctly sedate demeanor. Her elegant toilettes,
said to be selected in Paris by her famous kins-
woman, are remarkable for quiet costliness. Ahe
gown she wore to the theatre one evening lately
was of white silk striped from the low-cut bodice
to the skirt-hem with narrow rows of fine
black lace, put on lengthways. There must
have been miles of the dainty black cob-
web, and how tired the fingers must have
been that worked all the fairy fancy stitches on
the bodice ! The gallant who is to. be brother-in-
law to a Queen of Song, is tall, slight, and well-
groomed. He has always been a favorite with
the sex, and has annexed, ’tis said, such pet-names
as ‘ Tea-tray ’ and 4 Sconey.’
“ T’other night (Oct. 29), at the Burwood Boys
Home demonstration, in Melbourne Town Hall,
beholders felt their hearts warm within them
towards the boyish inmates of the * Home. Such
natural kids they looked, marching and singing in
deadly earnest, not a scrap self-conscious about
anything—well, just a wee bit, perhaps, re the
muscles that they fondly fancied were swelling
manfully in their bits of bare arms. A mild argu-
ment was overheard, too, between two mites as to
whose chest was the best ‘sprung.’ One of the
disputants was so small, and his uniform trousers
had been kilted up so high on his figure to save
the hems from trailing on the ground,
that he was nothing but trousers nearly
up to his chin, not an inch of ( ‘ chest,
being on view to show whether it was ‘ sprung
or not. They only admit 30 boys into the home.
More would be unhomelike. _ A Mr. Edwards
gives them an airy country residence and 20 acres
of orchard rent free. The inmates call the couple
in charge ‘Dad’ and ‘Mum’ and suffer from
homesickness when they are sent out into the
world at 18. Four of the old boys now own and
work a dairy farm in common, and get on better
together than the ordinary quartette of brothers
born. The promoters, finding situations for the
18-year-olds, constantly knock up against the
same difficulty. People, posing as philanthro-
pists, are willing to employ the lads, but at
reduced rates —dirt cheap, in fact. ‘ Dad and
‘ Mum ’ and those behind them don’t see the force
of this. ‘Our boys,’ they say in effect, ‘aren’t
going to be given away with a pound of tea for
the rest of their lives, just because, 10 or 12 years
ago, they fell upon thorns.’
“Some ladies turned up at a deputation to the
Brunswick (Melbourne) council the other day,
and Councillor Fleming raised the fire of the
deputationists by opposing a request for the use
of the barn-like local town hall for ‘ pleasant
Sunday afternoon ’ purposes. He declared that a
lot of new churns had been invading Victoria and
running the place down. Then the daily paper
reports this: —
The female members of the deputation were so nettled
by Or. Fleming's remarks that, although it was nearly
midnight, they waited outside the town hall to hoot him,
while several of them held their hat pins in their hands.
Or. Fleming, however, on finding.that he was hooted on
appearing on the town hall steps, returned into the
council chamber and made hisexit by the back door,
leaving his fair opponents anxiously watching for his
re-appearance. ,
That is how our sex’s impetuosity defeats its
purpose. The real political genius—the man or
woman who makes history—sticks the hat-pin into
the alderman first and hoots afterwards.
“At the Phil May sale some of the elderly
fossils had a reminiscent tear as they watched the
cartoons of old friends departed. _ R. S. Smythe
showed a sentimental gleam in his eye when the
sketch of Victoria’s first Agent-General, George
Verdon, was run out. The Much-Travelled
secured it, and, primed with the memories of the
fifties, related how he had met Verdon in the B.ig
Smoke at the inaugural dinner of the Colonial
Institute, at which Gladstone and Sir Stafford
Northcote—father of the approaching Governor-
General—made remarkable utterances.
‘ ‘Girls are twitting the Royal Arthur boys about

The Case of Mrs. McMullen.
«No one knows better than I do the priceless value of good
health,” says Mrs. Andrew McMullen, of Wagga. “It was just
after the birth of my little girl that I started to go down hill. No
matter what I took, I couldn’t get up strength. And, worst of all,
I had some terrible internal disorder that doctors did not seem to
understand. They told me it was caused by the birth of my little
girl, and the pains that shot through me were just like the pains of
labor. All the hot flannels, turpentine, and pain-killers failed
to ease me. A mouthful of food or even a cup of tea brought on an
attack, and nothing gave me relief except vomiting. I couldn’t
help crying out, and I am sure people passing by thought I was
being murdered. My eye-sight began to give way, and black
specks danced before my eyes. It was plain that I had something
terrible the matter with me. To add to my suffering, my nerves
„ave way I was crippled one day by the sharp shooting pains of
Sciatica in my hip, and then Neuralgia started to nag at every nerve
in my face. After this I was seldom out of bed. Often I was
taken with a shivering fit, and then the sharp cutting pains would
dart across my shoulders and pierce my stomach. My bad attacks
lasted for six or eight weeks at a time, and it was no good trying to
get about. When I did get up, I was too dizzy to stand alone. In
fact I was a wreck, and never hoped to be strong and well again.
But at last Mrs. Tom Callaghan, of Gundagai, made me promise to
give Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills for Pale People a fair trial. She
said they actually made new blood —and that is just what they did
for me. From the very first, they did me good. My appetite picked
up, and I had no more shivering fits because my veins were filled
with warm, red blood. Gradually the Neuralgia and the strange
internal pains stopped, and I felt a different woman. My heart
and nerves and stomach became sound, and in a little while I
enjoyed perfect health. I do all my own house-work now, and
recommend Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills to all my friends as the
grandest woman’s medicine in the world. They saved my life
without a doubt—as everyone in Wagga Wagga knows.”

“Manuka” : A certain Parliament had
a grievous scandal lately. A rather important
official was found just as the House was closing up
for the night, sleeping a large beery sleep in an
ante-room, and the discoverers took his clothes,
hung a necklace of empty bottles on him, and left
him on the premises. A charwoman found the
apparition in a waste-paper basket, and as it had
nothing upon it with which to buy her silence, nO
negotiations were possible.

a far-sighted
savage, Tuta r-
was a strong ( j
Imperia list ”
from a very
early age, and
fought side by
side with the
British troops against
his countrymen in many
a fierce scrimmage. Tuta—
a Ngatiporou (East Coast) chief — _
was a highly-colored jingo, and in the
troublous times in Poverty Bay he formed a native
company, called the Ngatiporou Rifles, which struck
hard and often for the white man from whom he
now begs a pittance. Tuta again became
prominent when the one-eyed fanatic, Te
Kooti, escaped from his Napoleonic exile
on the Chatham Islands, effected a
landing near Wairoa, and, gathering
his braves as he went forward,
descended on the settlers near Gis-
borne with spear and axe, and wiped
them out almost to a man. For his services, Tuta was
presented by the Government with an elegantly
chased silver sword of honor; but that has proved in-
sufficient means of support, and now that he is growing
old, and approaching the land of “ always fight ’’—the
Maori’s cheerful vista of the hereafter—he has come down
to rub noses with Seddon, and see if the Government has
a yam lying about.
In the list of officers of the Imperial
Federation League of Victoria appear the names
of Justices Holroyd (president), Hodges (vice-

not meddle in any politics—“imperial” or local—
and it is the duty of the Victorian Legislature to
call on these gentlemen to retire from positions
which might conflict with their judicial duties.

Alderman John Pigdon, who was Mayor
of Melbourne in 1877-8, died recently, aged 71
years. Mr. Pigdon was in office when an
imposing envelope arrived, addressed to him. as
Lord Mayor of Melbourne. The Mayor had high
hopes that Melbourne had been distinguished
amongst cities, but the document proved to be
only a begging letter from the Lord Provost of
Glasgow.
Dr. Green, the new Anglican Bishop-elect
of Brisbane, is a sort of ecclesiastical gipsy. He
was English born, but popped up in Melbourne
as a precocious boy. He flashed through Mel-

University ; next he was a cleric at Ballarat, then
Bishop of Armidale (N.S.W.), then Bishop of
Ballarat (Vic.), and now he is offered the position
of Bishop of Brisbane (Q.). He also tried to get
to the Boer war as chaplain.
M.L. Minister of Customs Mills inadver-

day does come, Seddon will be known as Lord

Mrs. Deakin, the wife of the Common-
wealth Premier, is a tall, stately woman. She is
the daughter of distiller Hugh Junor Brown, an
enthusiastic Spiritist. Mrs. Deakin’s meeting
with Alfred was romantic. Both were mediums —
Alfred was supposed to have the spirit of John
the Baptist in him when “ under control ”; the
lady had that of some ancient prophetess. Kin-
dred spirits in mediumistie work, they married
quite naturally. Now neither fraternises much
with spirits, but old man Brown sticks to it, and
recently gave £5OO towards lectures on Spookdom.
Amongst Maoriland newspaper scribes
Kiug Dick Seddon is a rather unpopular figure.
He has a habit of sending for a reporter, and
keeping him waiting for hours on the doormat.
Some time since one of Auckland’s smartest
journalists was hurriedly summoned to the Czar’s
office. After waiting outside half-an-hour, he
opened the door, put in his head, and asked how
long he was to be kept waiting. Then remarks
flew on both sides as thick as eggs at Vallombrosa.
Some time after, the pressman leased a country
paper, and the leaders of that journal now lash
chunks out of Seddon’s hide. The row which
started on Seddon’s doormat seems as if it would
only end with the death of one party or the other.

Victorian Senate-candidate Findley con-
fesses to being superstitious about the number 13.
He was the 13th President of the Trades Hall
Council, and during his whole term of office he was
out of work. When he was elected for Melbourne
he became the 13th member of the Labor party, and
as such he was expelled for “a seditious libel” in
the Tocsin. Now in the recent Labor plebiscite,
which closed on the 13th of the month, he was
chosen out of the 13 candidates to represent the
party. Seems from this that Findley will be
elected to the Senate by 1300 majority, and hold
his place for 13 years.
Edwin Smith, one of the most popular of
Adelaide citizens, on October 10 celebrated the
fiftieth anniversary of his arrival in S.A. In
Staffordshire, as a young man, he took
a leading part in politics on the side
of Radicalism, and when he landed in
Adelaide he fought on the same side and
had much to do with getting the prin-
ciple of one - man - one - vote into the
original State Constitution. He was
then a poor ironmonger, but he went
into beer, made a heap of money,
became a mayor and a legislator, was
knighted, and embraced Conservatism.
The Jubilee Exhibition building in
Adelaide came through Smith’s
“loyalty” in 1887 ; the Torrens Lake
was a result of his mayoralty over 20
years ago; and he gave the city a
bronze statue, the first it ever pos-
sessed. Also he is president of the
Cricketing Association, the Football
Association, the Commercial Travellers’
Association (once he was head of the
whole race of Australian bagmen) and
of many other organisations. He is reputedly
wealthy, though he has lost much money in
N.S.W. and Queensland pastoral properties.
John Smith, of Winton, aged 7L got lost
recently for a spell of nine days. Was picked up
at the end of that time by a search party not
much the worse, and he refused any aid from hos-
pital or doctor. Was nearly done, he owned up,
but what encouraged him to hang out was the
reflection that “ people in Winton owed him
money, and would get out of paying it if he did
not get home.” Smith had only a pigeon to eat
during the nine days. His debtors are going to
have a hot time, apparently.
“ Joey ” Bell’s retort to ex-Minister
Foxton, in Q. Assembly, that he (Joseph) “bad a
deal more sympathy with the aborigines than the
ousted Minister, but advertised it less,” calls to
mind that the nigger tribe which inhabited Jim-
bour run when the Bell family first sat down on
the station half a century ago, was never “ ordered
off.” Until recently the remnant, including
Charley Samuels, Combo, and some more roamed
peaceably there. Old hands tell of a strong
attachment between old Joshua Peter Bell and
Warabah, an original member of the tribe. When
Warabah pegged out he was buried near the Bell
homestead in shroud and cedar coffin, and Jim
Crowe, the chief mourner, got into the grave and
lay down in it at full length to make sure that it
was large enough to hold old Warabah without
crowding him.

Re par. (8., l/10/’O3) about retiring Westralian Auditor-
General Spencer and Treasurer Jim Gardiner’s cuss-word.
Gar liner’s retirement from the James Ministry is not
attributed in any way to that cause. He is more than
suspected of being half-owner, with wealthy Sam Copley,
of the South Perth Ferry Co., connecting that suburb
with Perth. It is a monopoly and pays handsomely
Moreover, it is rumored that Sam Copley goes on an
extended trip to Europe shortly, and Jim Gardiner takes
up the management of this vast concern at a salary of
£l5OO. As for Spencer, after 42 years’ continuous ser-
vice he received a violent shock in the shape of Federal
Auditor Peioy Witton’s report on his department, and so
wanders into the chill breeze of a relentless planet on a
pension.
S. Australia’s third and youngest Judge,
W. H. Bundey (probably the only Australian
Judge, by the way, who was a Mayor before
getting up to the has been specially per-
mitted to retire within the next month or two, six
months before the expiration of the 20 years’ ser-
vice necessary to entitle him to a pension. Mr.
Bundey really had too little confidence in himself
to be a Judge, and he has worried and fretted
himself into chronic ill-health. It was thought
for years that only two men were in the running
for the vacancy—Attorney-General Gordon and
Commissioner Russell, of the Insolvency Court ;
but now John Downer has quitted Federal politics,
and Adelaide is thinking that that may mean some-
thing. It is 20 years since S. Australia had to
appoint a Judge ; but as one of Bundey’s colleagues
is well past 70 and the other close up to it, there
will probably be a rush of appointments soon.

An interesting document was laid on the
table of the House of Representatives on the last
day of the session, showing the number of times
each member had attended. Spruce Myth was
absent no fewer than 147 days out of 215, but no-
one will deny that he was as useless on 68 days as
most men could be in the whole time. His
constituents will probably see that he is absent
215 times in the future. Lang (N.S.W.)
foreign trade representative (F. E. M‘Lean)
only turned up on 74 occasions. George Reid and
his Dry Dog were absent 132 times out of 215.
Groom (Q.), O’Malley (T.), and Mauger (V.) were
the only members who attended every sitting. If
the system were adopted of deducting a day’s pay
for every, absence where no valid excuse was-
forthcoming, Australia would save a proud dea! of
money.

LIFE IN A N.Q. BUSH TOWNSHIP.

“War E.” : Re the laconicism of the Chow.
Knew a cook of that race who thus summed up
shearers: “Firs’week, all say ‘welly good cook,
him boshter ’; nex’ week begin smell ’em tucker ;
thir’ week tell me go hell, no good; then sack !
Shealer blanky cow ! ”
“ Thula,” about a fowl :
Ohangwas only a dissolute old Langshan rooster, yet
he helped to enliven many a dull day in our slow little
town. Chang was the only surviving chick of a large
mcubatored clutch. Mrs. Publican O’Mara had reared
him tenderly, and he showed his gratitude by following
her around, like a faithful dog ; and would thump all and
?}?hdry of the fowls at feed-times, if they crowded her.
VVith this one exception, Chang waged a vendetta against
all women, and cats and dogs. Against Peggy, the
half-caste general, he bore a heavy grudge. Finding
her one morning at her devotions, scrubbing the passage
he commenced a flank attack, and with a wild gro«gv
rus j l an< f a jump, he sprang over her head, and got
wedged into the scrubbing bucket, where he was at the
mercy of his enemy, who proceeded to baste him with a
J no P- , I rescued him from this undignified position, and
locked him up in the fowl run, where he was supposed to
be always kept. But Chang was seldom a prisoner, for
he had so many admirers and friends amongst the boys
that he was always getting out. And when loose, there
was not a dog in the place that would face O’Mara’s fowl.
Chang wasted no time in tactics ; he would rush at his
opponent with his chest, and if the other animal got
underneath he stayed there till the end of the chapter.
Put Ohang never learnt to discriminate. One Saturday
he was having a quiet dust-bath at the wood-heap when a
stray dog sneaked up to the kitchen door just as a Syrian
basket woman came in through the yard-gate. This
double invasion raised the old fellow’s ire, and with an
angry crow he threw himself at the dog, which to avoid
the onslaught cannoned into the woman and upset her
and her load. After escorting the dog well off the pre-
mises Ohang returned just as the Syrian was stooping to
collect the scattered goods. With a mighty leap he lit
fair between her shoulders and drove her head first into
the dust, and then commenced his usual war-dance upon
the prostrate victim. The now infuriated woman
managed to seize his neck with both hands and com-
menced to belt the atmosphere with his struggling
body. Old Joe, the groom, up to this time had
been an interested spectator, but now, fearing for his
friend s safety, he attempted a rescue. He was swept off
hIS f j., by the mangled remains that were whirled
around the woman’s head. He eventually recovered the
corpse, and Peggy and the cook helped‘to pick up the
fallen treasures, and out of sheer joy they bought a
crown* worth of gew-gaws. The sad news soon circu-
lated, and when I came to dinner the stable yard was full
of boys and disreputable villagers, who had come to pay
their respects to the old warrior. Not a dog was visible,
though. At sunset Joe carried a box down to a hole in
the horse paddock, and there we interred Ohang like a
Christian.

Says the Riverina Recorder “ There
is a splendid river at Wilcannia, which is likely
to last through the shearing set.son. ’’ A river
that is likely to last through a shearing season
out there is something to enthuse about. When
it rains, the oldest inhabitant trots down and
puts in a stick at the water’s edge, and when the
shower is over he slides down again to see how
many inches the river hasn’t risen. In flood time
he puts in a great many sticks, following the
water up the bank. By. this means he records
how much it rises or falls in an hour—or a week.
They watch their ephemeral river very closely
about Wilcannia.

“ Twistee.” : To me, Nature seems to have
no. mood which distinctly predominates. The
weird melancholy spoken of certainly is there, but
not predominating. A very intimate acquaint-
ance with Nature must, of course, lead us to her
moods—to change when she changes. Therefore
we say “ a child of Nature.” He who thinks that
a weird melancholy or a weird expectancy pre-
dominates must be just a little either way off the
mental balance. I may lay some claim to an
unbiassed view, having lived for the last 10 years
away from cities, noise and strife, and for five
years, off and on, in a tent (as now), a bachelor-
adventurer’s existence. I have studied Nature in
all her moods. She suggests melancholy, expect-
ancy. power, peace, love, hatred—all the virtues
and all the vices, and exaggerates only to impress
the more. She never lies. She bids us hope, she
bids us fear, she bids us laugh, she bids us sorrow
—and she bids us sleep.
A barely probable yarn by “ Yarrum ” ;
A few years ago, a man was driving cow and calf along
the Western, or Gundaroo, shore of Lake George (N.S,W.)
when a native bear fell from his perch on a eucalyptus
and broke the calf’s back. Not long after I was at a
picnic near the same spot, and another bear fell about
60ft. into the tucker basket, breaking all the crockery
and doing considerable damage to the tarts. Since that
a swagman was found near Yass with his neck broken,
but with no other visible marks of violence. As he was
spread under a gum-tree I guessed a bear, but didn’t
like to say so. Since I have known of bears and their
falling habits, I give trees that harbor them a wide berth ;
and I always advise my friends to do the same. My
enemies I urge to go and look up at the interesting
animal.

“ R.J.C.” : The “ wonderfully good
work” mentioned by “C.P.” (Bulletin l/10/’O3)
should not go unrewarded. A genius who has
collected clutches “ unsurpassed in numbers ’’ of
rifle and regent birds’ eggs ought to be in
Darhnghurst Gaol exercising his scientific powers
on oakum. These destructive idiots whom
“ C.P.” describes as “ bush scientists ” are rapidly
exterminating the most beautiful and rare of
Australian birds. How is it that the law, which
wisely prohibits the taking of the eggs of the
pitta and other protected birds, is never enforced ?

There are a dozen N.S. Wales sheep-
stations bigger than the “enormous area” of 1000
square miles which John See and the provincial
crowd declare they won’t yield up to Australia for
the purposes of a Federal capital. On Momba,
held by Peter Waite and other S. Australians,
two such areas could be dropped. Tarella, owned
chiefly by Edward Quin, ex-M.L. A. for Wentworth,
and Mount Gipps, on which Broken Hill is built,
could both hold it comfortably, and have plenty
to spare for a few outer suburbs. And you could
almost put the site on that part of Corona which
is not stocked.

“ Yigilans ” about Westralian lands :
A Westralian land boom is the order of the day. “ Land
for nothing in Westralia : 160 acres free selection,” etc.,
etc. These things are not all they seem. Few things
are. The so-called agricultural areas all over Westralia
are “patchy.” There are no districts, as in the other
States, that would make close settlement possible or
large townships probable. A man might take up 1000
acres, and it’s more than likely he would not get 200 acres
suitable for agriculture. In the agricultural areas the
timber is heavy, consisting of jarrah and red-gum
chiefly, and costs from £lO to £2O an acre to clear. The
country far and wide is covered with useless shrubs,
flowers, black-boys and poisonous weeds; consequently
you rarely see stock depasturing on large areas unat-
tended. Sheep are shepherded and paddocked at night
There is no doubt, however, that when this heavily-
timbered country is cleared it will be found suitable for
fruit-growing. Vegetables, with the aid of manure, will
also thrive.
The pick of Westralian land from an agricultural point
of view is undoubtedly the Katanning and Narrogin
districts (south-east), bar, of course, the settled districts
of York and Northam. Cereals, with the aid of super-
phosphate and a drill, are grown here with good
results, as much as 40 bushels to the acre being
reaped. But no cereals will grow without manure.
The same remarks apply to the south-west. As an
illustration, there is no township from Perth to
Bunbury, a distance of 115 miles. The best land
is from Bunbury to Riverstown, some 60 miles.
You might get a good bit of from 500 to 600
acres here. The rainfall is heavy—from 30 to
40 inches. The land is hardly suitable for
cereals. A patch here and there, and then
miles of sandy useless country is the order
of things all over Groperland. Mixed farming
one scarcely ever sees.
Grazing as known in the eastern States is
not found here. There are few natural grasses,
except where the country has been ring-barked
and burnt. By burning the undergrowth a thin
kind of spear grass grows, but only a few inches
high, and of little nourishment. Grazing is, there-
fore, carried on in a very primitive manner, a man
with three or four thousand sheep being styled a
“ squatter.”
As regards land for [settlement: The eyes have
already been picked out of the country within the
immediate neighborhood of the railways, and you have
already to go miles back. To use a mining term, this
is essentially a poor man’s field. On the Nor’-west line
there is some fairland, but it belongs to a syndicate.

“ Scrip ” : A unique specimen of
the porker—a half-grown one, and a
greyhound in appearance—is owned by
a farmer at Warea (Taranaki, M.L.).
Piggy scraped up an acquaintance with
the farm horses, and accompanied them in their
jaunts as a matter of course. Its first notable
performance was a spin of 14 miles behind a
trap, and despite occasional bursts of fast trotting
it couldn’t be shaken off. This is the first example
of the express pig, or long-distance swine, or
flying porker that has come under my notice.

“ Cecil P.” . “ Why do the heathen rage
so furiously and the people imagine a vain
thing ? ” asked the Psalmist, some years ago.
There are various reasons. Here is one of ’em.
Ah Chow, the storekeeper, ordered some bill-heads
from the local newspaper office. On getting
them, he tore up to inquire frantically “Whaffor?
whaffor?” He further remarked, “No blanky
goo’! No f-e-e-ah ! ” Inquiry showed that the
haughty heathen objected to plain “Ah Chow”
on the bills and wanted “Mr. Ah Chow.” I’m
awaiting developments. If only I could see Sum
Fat, Esq., or Dam Foo, J.P., I feel that, young
and beautiful though I be, I could sink into the
silent tomb without a blessed murmur.
“Bobrid”: A
numberof writershave
been a bitrough on the
cocky’s hospitality
and cleanliness. Know
any number of them
who are quite hospit-
able, and who will
allow you to sleep in
the stripper if you
bring a bottle of
liquor with you. Only
remember one who
refused me the strip-
per, but he was a Dry
Baptist and a teeto-
taller. I slept on a
stretcher in his room.
It’s not love of dirt
which prevents a
cocky adding a bath-
room to his humpy,
but fear of public deri-
sion. Fancy cocky
putting in a bath ?
He would be the joke
of the country. Any-
way, I know one
cocky who washes
every three weeks
and changes his shirt
at least every two
months. He drinks
two gallons of rum a month, and cuts his
hair regularly with a pocket-knife. Let any
machine drummer or bagman approach the cocky’s
humble humpy with the proper spirit, and he’ll
never complain of lack of hospitality.
Since the rains, the brown sandy plains
around Broken Hill have become clothed in a
beautifully green carpet, plentifully besprinkled
with flowers. In some places, the grass is nearly
2ft. high. Wild turkeys, pigeons, duck—of late
years only a memory —are again appearing near
the town. Where they come from it is hard to
say. They must have been hibernating under-
ground.

“J. 0. G.” : Travelling near Ashford

THE HANDS OF VENUS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I was welcome in a palace when the ball was at my
feet;
I was petted in a garden, and my triumph was complete ;
But for me, above the alleys, there for ever shone a star—
Where the third-class public-houses and the dens of
Venus are.
Henry Lawson (8., 24/9,’03).
Ah, my candid, worthy brother, you’re a stranger to
deceit,
I have met you in the palace “ when the ball was at your
feet; ”
When you sipped the living nectar from the very choicest
bloom,
In the garden of the palace and within the gilded room—
In the garden of the palace,
From the figured glass and chalice,
When you sipped the living nectar from the very choicest
bloom.
I was born within a palace—bred within a realm of light,
And was barred from lusty love-dens and the tempting
haunts of night;
I was pampered, praised, and petted, and was shown a
path to tread,
That would lead me, so folks told me, from this world of
reeking dead—
That would lead me, so they told me,
To where angels would behold me,
To a bright and heavenly kingdom that is free from
reeking dead.
But in spite of all the praying and the pious palace role,
And the lengthy exhortations ’bout my future and my
soul,
There was something ever gnawing, gnawing, drawing
me apart—
Ever gnawing, ever drawing at my very inmost heart,
’Twas the hell-born hands of Venus
That so often come between us,
And the bright paths we have trodden, that were drawing
at my heart;
So I left the dear old palace, wandered forth into the
night,
Shunned the old friends of my boyhood and the faintest
ray of light—
Launched out on a sea of darkness, plunged into the
blackest cloud,
Sought to quell my craving hunger, ’mid the ever
shameless crowd;
Sought to quell my craving hunger
In the days when I was younger—
Plunged into a sea of darkness 'mid the ever shameless
crowd.
I have struggled, and I’ve striven, and I’ve tried in vain
to rise,
But the people of the palace will not harken to my cries;
I am kicked, and cuffed, and scoffed at, and am trodden
under, feet,
And I’m longing for the garden where your triumph was
complete ;
Oh ! I’m longing for the palace,
From a heart grown cold and callous,
Ever longing for the palace where my lot was not com-
plete.
I have quitted the dark alleys and the dingy dens cf
love,
And have found a situation on a platform just above ;
And I mean to struggle upward through the sunshine
and the rain.
Till within the gay old palace I am safely housed again ;
Aye 1 within the gay old palace,
When our hearts are no more callous,
We may drink the sparkling vintage, and be honored
once again.

cure him, and carefully placed on
the woodchopper’s extensive palm
two small white specks, that looked
like two bits of manna in the wil-

them keenly, then looked round

Old North Australian traveller Christie,
moving along the N.T. coast lately, sat down to
see a gory conflict. It was on the Finniss Plains,
where representative warriors from four different
tribes had gathered to wipe out some old scores.
A fifth tribe was interested, and was to also have
the chance of having its collective neck dislocated ;
but it was delayed on the road, and while the
other four waited they smoked, and smoked, and
smoked, and finally the horrible discovery was
made that the tobacco had run out. That broke
them up ; a common disaster had drowned their
differences, and they faded out of the landscape
without breaking a head.

personality of his hospitable and ever-devoted
wife. Genius, as a rule, has no time to look after
its domestic affairs; and Phil May was no excep-
tion to this, for he died leaving his widow practi-
cally penniless. A movement to raise a fund to
buy an annuity for Mrs. May has been started in
London under the auspices of a committee includ-
ing editor Burnand, of Punch, playright Pinero,
and Shannon, the celebrated portrait-painter.
To assist it, The Bulletin, which will start the
local list with a donation of =£2oo, asks for sub-
scriptions from Australia. Any money sent to
this office for the fund will be duly acknowledged
and remitted to the proper quarter in London.
The Phil May Sale.
The Melbourne sale of Phil May “ originals ” was
marked at the outset by a charge for admission, a
two-edged protective innovation which cut both
ways, but doubtless cut deepest in the right
direction. Gemmell-Tuckett’s art gallery, where
the drawings had been displayed to advantage
what time the multitude rolled up in hundreds to
the show, is fully large enough for any ordinary
picture-sale gathering, yet not sufficiently
spacious to accommodate an extraordinary
rush of sightseers. Under the circumstances
the remarkable popularity of the Phil May
exhibition was alarming. Something bad to
be done to safeguard the sale from the
threatened mobbing, and as the event had been
fixed for the Thursday in Hospital Sunday week,
the suggested policy of a shilling admission fee
was adopted, and a Melbourne Hospital collector
took the money at the door. The result was a
satisfactory attendance of buyers who appreciated
their elbow-room, whilst the rest of the world and
its wife stayed carefully away.
“ On the Melbourne Block” was bought for £2l
by Allan and Co. “Jumps and Jim Jams ”at £l5,
together with a political cartoon subject (£5) and
“Lock and Key” (£6), went to Melbourne Art
Gallery. Bidders showed pluck, tempered by
artistic discrimination, and several of the smaller
things fetched substantial prices, but the large
portrait drawings went well, or otherwise,
according to circumstances over which the artist
had no control. That of the late Baronet
Clarke was secured for “the family” for £8 10s.
Chief Justice Madden and Pan ton, P.M., realised
a “fiver” apiece, Bard of Works Fitz-Gibbon
being the purchaser of these and other “ identity ”
subjects, whilst his own portrait was included
among the several lots that went to Theodore
Fink. Melbourne Grammar school got its old
friend, Dr. Bromby (a speaking likeness), for £5,
and the historic picture of Peter Lalor went a
bargain to a respectable bid, but for some
of the most talked-of portraits the com-
petition was very weak. They proved to
be the surprises of the sale, going “dirt cheap”
at a pound, or two, or three at the most. L. L.
Smith and David Syme fell below the dignity of a
“fiver.” Old Jimmy Mcßain touched the mini-
mum “ quid ” merely because the original happens
to be dead and buried. What’s the odds 1 In the
case of these portraits the surviving local notoriety
or utter forgottenness of the original matters
nothing to the purchaser, whereas the fact that
Phil May’s name is attached to each drawing
gives it a value which will soon be very evident to
everyone who knows aught about the world of
black-and-white art.

Plain Bill: Please. sen'd> name'and" address
W.JiO. (Wellington): Exports sbould .be sufficient to
pay for imports and vton-pay interest on foreign
debt (if any), also to pay something off the debt itself. If
our imports are greater than our exports it may mean •
(1) That our country has money invested abroad and that
the surplus imports represent interest paid to us—in that
case we are rich. (2) Or that our country has money
invested abroad and that the surplus imports represent
interest paid to us and also part of the principal being
returned —in that case we are rich, but are getting
poorer. (3) Or it may mean that we are borrowing
money abroad to pay for the surplus of imports—in
which case the surplus shows that we are on the road to
bankruptcy. A surplus of exports may mean that we are
investing money abroad and growing rich, or that we are
deep in debt and the surplus is required to pay-interest
on the debt. And if the surplus isn’t big enough to pay
the interest, then we are getting still deeper in debt....
F.B. : Sorry “Ten Head” not quite up to mark
R.R. : Would need a lot of fixing up ... Hugh S. : End
rather good, but most of the rest is weak and superfluous..
....Vivian : You don’t get weight enough into it....
D.W.W. : Too oracular and pretentious... .A.W. : Such
an abrupt and jerky style is fatal to the subject
Arline : Charming enthusiasm, but lamentable grammar.
.. ..Weston : Has an original touch, but is too crude and
shapeless Scorer: “Jimmy” has some humor, but
lacks coherence and grip.. ,;K.D.R. : Moderate merit
only.. ..Taro : Verse no good. Other item will make a
par.... Woolcha : Yes ; for all accepted matter... .B.T. t
Couldn’t possibly print, such an abomination
Lady Kitty : Metal in it, but beaten out too thin....
Glenfern : Crude and juvenile. Still, you have an ear
for melody, and may yet do good work Marita :
Casual and unsubstantial....B.W. : A kind of hilarious.
hoggishness... .Gantline : Conspicuous incapacity
Andrew F. : Smothered by too much .recapitulation. A
story should, to some extent, be allowed to tell itself
F. : Lacks the pifluSncy and spirit required by the
subject.. ..W. Mac.: You don’t hit off smartly enough....
G. : “ Glenara ” is quite genuine. So is “ Chasselas.
Believe the other man to be a fraud ; at least, neither
thenamenorthe town correspond...J.R.(Vic.): Your copy
was posted back before your violent letter reached us.
Nothing you ever send is of the slightest value ; its
crudeness and confusion of thought are something
appalling Tim W.: Too voluminous Ajax : Right,
in the main ; but you are too burly and bumptious in
your way of putting things W.T.W.: Puerile treat-
ment of a grown-up subject....A.N. : Too slight and
sketchy Veronica: Frisky and risky..... Jed : You
don’t seem able to get out of the conventional rut
T.M.T. : Good ideas, but a most unbeautiful style
Sarpedon : Disastrous rhymes and calamitous metre
Toby R. : Irritatingly discursive and inconsequent
8.X.: Full of flatulent self-conceit ; you don’t know
enough to know how much you don’t know.... . Jess A. :
Pathetic and sympathetic, but hopelessly unskilful
Momus : Appeared in B. (l/10/’O3) Gadly : Verses too
rugged. You are the first contributor who has delibe-
rately written “Poetry”ontbeoutsideof the envelope....
W.J.M.: “Day Dream” eminently commonplace
T.P. (Swampy Oak) : Govt, entomologist says they are an
ordinary cuss of the caterpillar variety, and can be got
by the ton in many parts of Australia F.R. : The
humorous possibilities of that subject have been ex-
hausted Waif: Idea wouldn’t work. You can’t make
a man bailee of your property—whether it is MS. or any-
thing else—without his agreeing to act Bonny Pensla:
Your chance quite a hopeless one W.J.S.: Versifica-
tion good, but all those ideas and most of those phrases
have been worked to death W.W. : (1) Thanks. _ Pars.
not returned were probably kept for use; also, “ aboriginal ”
items sometimes take a long while to get in. (2) The
Bulletin believes in an absolutely prohibitive tariff on
all articles we can reasonably produce in Australia.
(3) In S. A. and M.L. the woman vote has, so far, not gone
markedly sectarian Robt. O.: Fairly skilful, but any
remarks about the girls’ eyes must be very skilful to get
in ; girls’ eyes have been dealt with so often before. You
know most girls have eyes J.P.: Would appeal to too
small a class D.M.M.: Better submit it to some
English paper M.L.0.: Lines “written for a young
lady’s scrap-book” are generally sweet, modest, little
things that it would be a pity to drag to publicity
Tom L. : Declined, owing to difficulty of making “ large ’’
rhyme with “ mirage.’’. .E. Knight: “ Regrets ” shows a
noble disregard of metre H.E.: “Rainbow” declined.
... .A.P. : Have doubts about “Arum Lilies.”. ...E. de L.:
Can’t you give some approximation to the date?
Temerity : Rather purposeless jingle.. ..Waihora: “ Cun-
ning Devil” declined; very laborious dog story....
A.G.A. : Very ordinary long metre....New Chum:
Dreary record of hard fact.... Mimosa: “October”
joggles terribly on some short legs and some long ones.
....Belmont: One good par Albert A.: “Love” a
wearisome and laborious compounding of rhymes....
Banool: “Vera” won’t rhyme with “ nearer.”.... L.W.
(Briagolong) : You propose that the State is to print an
unlimited amount of paper money and lend it to private
borrowers on the security of their property, and then the
private borrower is to try to pass the paper on somebody,
but when £100,000,000 of paper has thus been circulated
in a country which has really only a use for £20,000,000,
the stuff will just be the same old, depreciated currency.
In the Canadian banking system which The Bulletin
advocates, the paper isn’t forced into circulation at all—
Bandar: St. Peter joke lacks novelty F. (Boulder):
Letter received. Rather admire your cheek in trying to
annex an old Bulletin writer’s pen-name of “Spinifex”
as your own Havelock: George Reid used to harp
wearily on the statement that “ the only way to teach a
dog to swim was to throw him into the water,” and to say
that, by taking off the Protectionist duties in N.S.W., he
threw the dogs (i.e., the local industries) in the veater,
where they learned to swim for themselves. As Reid,
among other items of Protection, gave 50 per cent.
Protection to the penny Freetrade papers which sup-
ported him, the Freetrade press was a dog that remained
dry. Bulletin is still asking the reason of the dryness
of that dog. Reid has dropped his dog metaphor n0w....
HE WAS ALL FOR WHITE AUSTRALIA.

out of Bulletin’s 'line;... A.N.: Sluggish verse about a
sleepy subject Yespa: Commonplace and dry-as-dust.

and tiresome verse upon an old and weary theme
Johnnie S.: Hopelessly incorrect as regards facts

It is alleged that the manor of Kenner-
leigh, belonging to the Northcote family, of which
the coming Governor-General is a member, was
won by the ancestor of the Northcotes in a game
of cards from the previous owner, one Dowrisb.
Few men have a better knowledge of the
working of the Lands Acts than has Land Agent
W. N. Willis, of 21 Bligh-street. Payment by
results is not only reasonable but also novel.*
The fifth Duke of Richmond, who died
recently aged 85, was descended from diaries II.
and the French spy Louise de Keroualle, Duchess
of Portsmouth, and for years practically Queen of
England. The duke received a pension of £19,000
till 1886, when it was commuted for a sum of
nearly half a million sterling. Forneron’s
interesting life of Louise de Keroualle, which
frightened the duke into seeking the commutation,
sums up thus: —“ The British Parliament, which
thinks .£1200 a year enough to relieve the
distressed families of authors, artists, scientists,
and other benefactors of their country, continues
to pay the Duke of Richmond £19,000 a year in
virtue of the seoret services rendered to Louis
XIV. by his' ancestress Louise de Keroualle.”
While making things easy for her descendants,
this daughter of the horse-leech did not forget)
herself. In one year she drew from the English
Treasury £136,668. Not satisfied with this, she
trafficked in royal pardons to rich convicts.

The following verses dropped in from
Queensland the other day. They are published
on general principles. The name of the lady who
wrote them is suppressed. She may be a nice
girl, and it would be a sin to arouse ill-feeling
against her:
It is often I do see
The Limb of the Law
Astrolling with a Lady fair
Is she his Decoy ;
Is she his future Bride.
Or is she his prisoner.
Oh the Bobby and his Girl.
Some would be wise ones,
Shakes the Head and ponders ;
Looks rather strange,
To see Miss Twenty, strolling ;
With the Local hobby
A Hint goes round and says ;
She will be betrayed with a Babe in Anns.
Oh the bobby and his girl.
Let us hope that in Truth ;
She will be his Bride.
His Prisoner for life and Death
No more to flirt
And Break the Hearts of men
Oh the Bobby And his girl
And when joined in Holy wedlock
May she be a model wife
Of Purity and Justice
Help the Limb of the Law
To Perform His Duty
In his Beat upon the street
Oh the bobby and his girl.
Let the bobby show
The scandelmongers vile,
His intentions are pure and
Above suspicion of Anything vile
Like a Libertine
Oh the bobby and his girl.

“ Gr. H.” : Herr Carl Schmidt occasionally
takes a turn at navigating the bier-shop of which
he is the proprietor; but except in very stormy
weather Mrs. Carl walks the bridge and makes up
the daily financial dead reckoning. Recently the
advent of a pocket-edition Carl necessitated Herr
Schmidt taking several watches in succession; and
at seven bells the other evening a tired publican
quarrelled vehemently with one of the house’s best
customers, who, being temporarily insolvent,
wanted a drink on tick. Carl, senior, repulsed
the thirsty one thus : “ Ach, py crigey, no; af I
drust a mans elefenteen timeness pefore und he
bay ub dat is alride ; pud af I drust heem again-
ness und he doand bay, den dat is all wrong, und

no ; I tole you af you aind got some money I aind
got some bier ; und af I aind got some bier I aind
got some brofit, und af I aind got some brof ’’
The thirst swore violently just here, though, and
left, and the disquisition broke off through its
own weight.

Sydney Telegraph devoted a leader last
week to considering what England should do with
its embarrassing increase of wealth so as to avoid
being smothered in gold. ■ Well, it might feed the
12,000,000 citizens who are always on the verge of
starvation, for one thing.
The electors of Swan Hill (Vic.) heckled
Yes-No Reid so much at his campaign-opening
speech that at last he got his wool off. “I
suppose you will deny even the drought next ? ” he
bellowed. Promptly came the. reply—“lf you
talk much about it we may.”
About the last possible touch of comedy
in N.S.W. politics was the appeal of the See
Government to Carruthers to postpone his motion
of censure for a week so that Minister Crick might
go to the Cup. Some day a general election will
be postponed till a Minister gets back from the
dog-fight.
Tom Rose, M.L.A., addressing a N.S.W.
country audience, spoke a full hour in glowing
eulogy of his prospective boss, Carruthers, and
on sitting down stated he was willing to answer
questions. A hairy wayback rose slowly and
asked: “Could you tell me, sir, why it is you
have such a deadly down on Misther Caroothers ? ”
N.S.W. ASSEMBLY: A SUGGESTION.
The side whose representative is licked has its Bill .thrown out.
G. H. Reid, whom S.M. Herald stages as
Australia’s greatest master of platform repartee :
A Voice : Soft soap a penny a pound
Mr. Reid : Yes, that gentleman’s policy would make it
twopence per pound, and perhaps he would not be able to
afford an annual bath at that price.
Very like George Perry’s Domain wit.
The Morgan Ministry in Q. is already
beginning to find the inconvenience of coming
into office on an anti-taxation issue. The finances
are in a woeful state, but the Government is
pledged to introduce no further taxation this
Parliament. As a way out it intends to continue
the unjust and oppressive poll-tax for a year. It is
a bad way out.
M.L. Premier Seddon forecasts legislation
to abolish the Legislative Council in that State.
Yet Mr. Seddon’s Council is a comparatively
harmless collection of fossils, and rarely ventures
on anything but a timid grumble at his progressive
legislation. If Seddon had to deal with the
Victorian Council he would probably roast it and
feed it to the Maoris.
“Nemo ” writes from Swan Hill (Vic.) :
The Freetrade Circus, with G. H. Reid, the lightning
change artist, as chief performer, struck Swan Hill on
Monday night last. Admission being free there was a
good attendance. About 8.15 George waddled on to the
platform, followed by his chairman, the local Sawbones.
This was the signal for shriek No. 1; the picture was too
funny—dignity and impudence personified. The recep-
tion was a very poor one ; with the exception of a few
special creations who consider themselves high society,
there was no reception at all, and Reid froze consider-
ably. He was not taken seriously, and it hurt him. He
battled away for two hours, raved about the dear old
mother land, wobbled this way, wriggled that, and
finally sank into his chair, a wet and flabby heap. If he
doesn’t meet with a better reception elsewhere than he
got in this little Mallee township, he will have to bury
that Dry Dog again.
Sydney Telegraph overdid its lie when
it tried to persuade the public that at George
Reid’s meeting in Melbourne only three hands
were held up for the Protective policy of the
Deakin Government and all the rest of the
audience cheered frantically for Reid and his
importing policy. Only a silly ass of a paper
runs things to that length.
The chief work done by the S.A. Parlia-
ment in the session just closed was the passing of
a consolidating Lands Bill which has been
promised annually for 10 or 12 years. It codifies
countless conflicting Acts and amendments which
have long been the despair of everybody except
the lawyers. S.A. has now a very decent land
law and a great deal of terribly bad land.
Federal Labor leader J. C. Watson con-
veys a stinging rebuke to N.S.W. State Labor
party when he points out that, whilst refusing to
vote for the nationalising of 1000 square miles of
N.S.W. territory by the Australian Government,
that party made no protest against handing oyer
100 times as great an area in the Western Division
to private co.’s—mostly absentees—for 40 years.
The S.M. Herald country correspondent
doing his little best to earn a shilling or two over
the Glen Innes election :
North Guyra, Thursday.—Great satisfaction is ex-
pressed here at Mr. Thomas’s victory.
On polling day the Guyra folk, to the number of
50, went to vote, and the majority of them voted
for Thomas’s opponent, Hay.
Hurley, M.L.A., wants N.S.W. to sus-
pend the Public Works Committee for 12 months,
or take steps that no more proposals be placed
before it for the present. This is in view of the
scarcity of loan money, and is another evidence of
the fine old crusted belief that the country can’t
be expected to do anything except out of loans,
and that when loans are scarce progress must dry
up.
A clause in Seddon’s new Maoriland
Licensing Bill provides that all liquor seized in
no-license districts is to be handed to hospital
boards for the use of patients. This raises four
questions : —(1) What kind of patient will be able
to stand the home-made liquor which is sure to
come into vogue? (2) Will the patients be able to
get through all the liquor? (3) Will there be a
ruinous increase of patients ? (4) Will the hospital
doctor be sober occasionally with all that grog
pouring in ?
“ Burglar Bill ” : Never heard of a criminal
on the drop returning thanks to John Haynes or
anyone else who has striven to abolish capital
punishment. He generally thanks the governor
of the gaol, because he sent him in a
big breakfast on the morning
of the execution, and ex-
presses his high opinion of
the warder and the hang-
man. Then the chaplain
decides that he passed away
in a beautifully affable frame
of mind.
The necessity for the Bill lately rejected
in Victoria, providing that every married man
making a will shall be compelled to leave at
least one-third of his property to his widow, was
shown the other day by the testament of an
ex-policeman at Ballarat. He bequeathed £3400
to charities, and only 12s. a week to Mrs.
Policeman, and £5O to -his daughter. Deceased
was a kind of crank who used to write at great
length to the newspapers.
“F.C.”: If appearances don’t deceive
more than usual, one can forecast the death of the
Deakin Ministry to the day. Barton’s successor
promises to re-introduce the Arbitration Bill with
the State servants left outside its provisions as
before—the same abject grovel to Iceberg Irvine
repeated. And as the new House will be even
more democratic than the last, Deakin will there-
by sign his political death-warrant, and Kingston,
Higgins and Co. will arrive.
So long as magistrates continue to fine
shipowners (through the captains) £5 every time
they let a Chow or Jap sailor or fireman escape,
these will continue to make a farce of the Re-
striction Act by slipping over the ship’s side “ un-
beknownst. ” The captain almost always has from
£lO to £2O of Ah Fat’s or Yoshi warra Hakidado’s
wages in hand, and as that person knows better
than to sue for them, the skipper can pay the fiver
and then make a profit on the deal.
From Sydney Telegraph’s account of G.
H. Reid’s tour of the Victorian provinces:
A charge of two shillings had been made for admission
to the dress circle and the stalls.
Mr. Reid said he did not believe in this system of
charging for admission to political meetings.
Reid’s mind is so incurably crooked that he must
Yes-No even on the question of charging for his
circus.. He “does not believe in charging for
admission,” but he charges for admission.
PHEW!
It is predicted that Victoria will return
more Laborites to the next Australian Parlia-
ment than any other State. Victoria, since the
advent of Tom Mann, has become honeycombed
with Labor leagues, and even the Argus admits
that Labor is “ finely organised.” Also the ramp-
ant foolishness and brute violence of the Irvine
Government has done even more for the demo-
cratic cause than Mann has done. When the num-
bers go up that “paid agitator,” R. S. Walpole,
will almost certainly be an astonished individual.
As usual, the “ poor fanner ” cry, which
was used to cut down the land-tax in S. Australia,
turns out a hollow fraud. On the present assess-
ment the farthing would bring in £28,000, of
which £ll,OOO would be paid by rich landlords,
owninggsstates valued at £5OOO and upwards, and
another £6OOO by owners of land inside corpora-
tion boundaries. All that the “poor farmer”
would pay would be the small balance. So the
farmer was used as a stalking horse to save the
rich landlord, and the State’s finances once more
were sent to chaos.
A half-hearted attempt was made this year
to cut down the N.S.W. Speaker’s salary ; but it
fizzled out. All the same, the N.S.W. Speaker is
lucky compared with his brethren. At present
he gets £1370 a year, as against £llOO drawn by
the Speaker and President of the Australian
Parliament. The Queenslander draws £lOOO, but
the amount will probably come down (it has been
attacked pretty well every year); Jenkin Coles,
of S. Australia, receives £600; the Tasmanian a
mere £350 ; the Victorian £lOOO ; and the paternal
Lee Steere, of Westralia, £6OO.
Truly the way of the economist is hard.
The Australian Government, as a mode of saving
money, proposes to make the country postmasters
assist in the general election. Whereupon arises
the. wail of those who have been used to collect
their two or three guineas a day for receiving a
few dozen votes. There are 1800 polling booths
in New South Wales alone, and though everybody
is agreed that the Australian Government should
be economical, it is remarkable how unanimously
“Enquirer” and “ Pro Bono Publico ” are rising
up to demonstrate that this is the wrong economy.
“ W.W.” writes : *
The Bulletin, being a true disciple of Protection, may
be able to inform me how, it is that so much imported
fruit is consumed in the Commonwealth. Worked on a
sheep-run many years ago that was owned by a Scotch
marmalade-canner. The station store was at all times
well-stocked with marmalade made in Scotland. Now,
I am reliably informed that neither lemons, oranges, nor
sugar can thrive in the vicinity of Glasgow. 1 have
camped with jumbucks and cattle beside orchards in four
of the Australian States, and have seen f ■ uit lying rotting
under the orchard trees, and at the s:; me time comrades
spreading London-made jam on their damper.
Well, it’s partly lack of proper Protection, and
partly lack of proper sense. If the Government
gave adequate Protection, to keep the foreign
article out, the sense to use the local stuff would
soon come.
Among the pitiably small matters with
which N.S.W. Assembly amused itself last week
were these :
A question whether the Australian Government had
sacked a Post Office clerk.
Questi n whether the Premier was aware that a certain
individual had selected plate or dishes, or something, for
use in Government House.
Further consideration of a proposal that a committee
of nine members, including the Premier, should sit to
consider whether an unsuccessful candidate who stood
for Parliament 14 years ago, and got only 92 votes, should
have his lost deposit refunded.
That a committee of nine members, including the
Premier, should sit to consider whether a policeman had
made a mistake in arresting a man named Anderson.
That there should be laid on the table all documents
connected with the extension of a back street in an
obscure bush hamlet.
That a committee of nine members should sit to inquire
why Jones’s mine at Adelong isn’t working.
That a committee of nine members, including the
Treasurer, should sit to consider the reason for the dis-
missal of a railway-repairer.
That a committee of ten members, including the
Premier, should sit to consider whether a messenger was
unjustly sacked.
That a committee of ten members, including the Minis-
ter for Works, should sit to consider a laborer
at Fitzroy Dock ought to have been sacked but wasn’t.
That a committee of nine members, including the
Premier, should sit to consider whether a certain public
official who had written a book on vegetables had therein
borrowed another man’s ideas on vegetables, without
acknowledgment.
N.S.W. used to have a Parliament. Now it has
got a sort of mental marine store and banana
barrow.
. The ineffable impudence of Yes-No Reid !
Part of his Melbourne speech was taken up with
an attack on the Federal Government for its
“delay and hesitancy” in sending a Common-
wealth Contingent to S’Africa. But the one
bright spot in Reid’s career —the one occasion on
which he showed a real sagacity and a faculty
of seeing further ahead than the miserable
little advantage of the moment —was when
he more than delayed and hesitated, positively
refused, as N.S.W. Slate Premier, to send troops
to harry the Boers. The war had just broken out,
and half a-dozen screaming Premiers —Kingston,
sad to say, among them —wished to despatch con-
tingents and warships and kerosene and other
munitions of war. They urged Reid, as Premier
of the most populous State, to offer a contingent,
but urged in vain. He minuted on one of their
frenzied telegrams—
Put by for the present. I have come to the opinion
that the sympathy of the Australian colonies with the
legitimate desires of the British inhabitants of the
Transvaal has already been made sufficiently manifest. A
difference between the British people and the people of
the Transvaal scarcely calls for displays of patriotism at
this end of the world—the strength of the position being
all on the side of Great Britain.
Very shortly afterwards Reid went back on that
manly and sagacious statement, and he feebly ex-
plained that he was all the while nourishing a
great thirst for Boer gore, but refused to offer a
contingent “ for fear of irritating the Boers! ”
Row he has the unspeakable gall to pose as a
frantic Jingo hurt to the heart by the fact that
Barton didn't rush with enough haste to embrue
his hands in Boer blood.

M.L. Premier Seddon has put his second"
ballot fad in the Electoral Act Amendment Bill.
Like all electoral systems that carry elaborate
frills and flounces, the second ballot really isn’t
worth while. The present system may not be
scientific perfection ; but neither is the other—it
simply brings together the two men who, in the-
first round, had the biggest personal following. If:
there were a few more Protectionists than Free-
traders in a district, but if there were six Protec-
tionist candidates and only two Freetraders, the-
second ballot would most likely be between the-
two Freetraders, even though the Protectionist?
voters in the aggregate outnumbered the Free-
traders. Seddon’s plan, therefore, makes a longer

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“ If I get into power."— G. 11. Reid.
If I get into power
Some fine things you will see—
In less than half an hour
The times will brighter be.
The sun that seems to pine,
For lack of fire and wit,
Will on my eyeglass shirte,
And take new light from it.
The great news he will tell
To smiling hill and plain,
And say “ The world goes well—
George Reid’s on top again.”
The black will turn to white,
To sweet will turn the sbur,
And every day be bright—
When I get into power.
Good things will all be free,
Champagne as cheap as rum,
And rum as cheap as tea
In My Millennium.
Then cast your cares aside,
Put in your coat a flower,
Let smaller matters slide
And Get Me into Power.

The members of N.S.W. Public Service
'lender Board did not lose much time in circum-
venting Parliament, which lately decided that no
fees were to be paid to the lafge-salaried officers
for Tender Board work done during office hours.
The very next meeting was called for 4.30 p.m.,
which was outside regular office hours, so that the
fee could be collected. The regular hour used to
be 2.30, and properly so, for the office staff is not
then required to work overtime while the Board
is sitting. The fee is £1 per sitting, and a return
of time worked after hours in return for the £1
will be awaited with interest.

Lung Disease
VITADATIO
Singleton, N.S.W., May SO, 1901.
To ME. S. A. PALMER—
Dear Sir, —My daughter has suffered with Lung Disease
since she was five years of age. She is now eleven and
in good health, thanks to your valuable medicine. After
tying a great many patent medicines, with varying
meet, I was persuaded to give VITADATIO a trial, and
the improvement in her condition was at once noticed by
Mrs. Porter and myself. My daughter has been a great
sufferer, and was given up by the doctors after breaking
a blood vessel, about three years ago, the medical man
remarking that she could not live through the winter,
but VITADATIO willed otherwise, as she is now well.
Three years ago she had a bad attack, when she
frequently spat up blood, so I immediately purchased a
bottle of your medicine, with the result that it completely
cured her. You can make any use of this Testimonial,
as I would like to see other sufferers benefit by your
appropriately named medicine—VITADATIO.
Yours truly,
WILLIAM PORTER,
Bootmaker.

This doesn’t look healthy in view of the expected

Many tyre troubles arise through ignorance of
the proper degree of inflation to the pneumatic tyre.
It should be pumped to such a degree of hardness that,
when the machine has got its full load, on the portion
that touches the road, it should show little or no
flattening. If the tyre shows an appreciable flattening
it should be further inflated. A tyre that is partially
inflated rolls in the rim, and when greasy roads are
struck there is a grave risk of side-slip. Moreover, a
tyre that is continually ridden in a soft condition will
soon wear out, for, by rolling, wear of the fabric is set up,
which sooner or later causes the cover to burst. “ Pump
hard ” therefore is a good motto for the cyclist. In such
tyres as the Dunlop this air pressure will enable the
wheels to glide over obstacles without sh'.cks or undue
vibration.*

Brain Food.
Not long since there was a great run on the
fish markets, because it was announced that
fish was food for the brain. Of course the
df
fallacy of the fad was
soon exploded. Nor-
mally, the food we
eat nourishes brain,
nerves, muscle, bones,
etc., each part of the
body assimilating
phosphorus, salts, lime,
according to its need.
When the brain begins
to show weakness, or
the nerves become
sensitive, it is a sign
that there is a loss'of
the nutrition contained
in the food eaten, and
this loss is, in general,
due to disease of the
stomach, and its allied
organs. Dr. Morse’s
Indian Root Pills aid
the digestion and
assimilation of food.
It is not the quantity
of food eaten, but the
amount of nourish-
ment which is retained
that benefits the system. If from any cause the
nourishment in the food is not extracted, the
whole body suffers. Dr. Morse’s Indian Root
Pills, by keeping the liver and kidneys active, the
stomach clean, and the blood pure, tone theentire
system. They are a positive and permanent cure
for all diseases arising from a disordered stomach,
liver and kidneys, and are an infallible remedy for
constipation, biliousness, sick headaches, piles,
pimples, boils, skin diseases and female ailments.

SPORTING NOTIONS.
Lord Cardigan s success in Melbourne Cup
means that Mo. will have to pay out freely, albeit it was
such a fine betting race and so many were backed for
large sums that the Dooks, as a whole, cannot possibly lose.
Certainly none other of the Sydney nags carried so much
money, but there were one or two Victorians who would
have brought disaster to the ring if thev had won and a
couple of New South Wales reps.—Ossian and Oblivion
(both owned and heavily backed by Minister for Lands
Crick) must surely have (had either got home) caused the
disappearance of at least two or three of the
raucous-voiced. Owner and hreeder of Lord
Cardigan is Mr. Mayo, of Maitland. The na<*
in appearance, takes after his dam, Lady Trenton.
He is light framed. As a two-year-old, he ran second in
a Hawkesbury Park Stakes, second in A.J.O. Novice
Handicap (one mile) to Highflyer, and second to Famous
in Warwick Farm Flying Stakes (one mile). Twice
this season w.f.a. races fell to him. First he
beat Cyanide and Sir Leonard, and then Wake-
ful, Postillion, Sir Leonard and The Victory, with-
out an effort. Famous only beat hinr by a head in
Wycombe Stakes (w.f.a., one.mile three fur.). Eandwick
Plate saw Lord .Cardigan receive 2st. llh> from Wakeful
yet in Melbourne Chip the champion mard was asked to
give him 3st. 6Jbs., and how it, was sized up by those who
came at the Derby winner (F.J.A.) that a horse of his
age was going to give such a proved top-notcher as Lord
Cardigan 161bs. surpasses all understanding. Might be
mentioned that Lord Cardigan is a grandson of his owner’s
old favorite, Black Swan.
, * * * *
F.R.C. Derby winner, FLA., is a beauty,
and, for a pony standing not more than 14.2, a remark-
able performer. His win excels all previous end to end
Derby triumphs. For a light-fleshed nag his middle
section is exceptionally well rounded, and thighs and
gaskins are urtique. F.J.A., who belongs to Rupert
Clarke, owns a splendid record ; Gwyn Nursery, Moonee
Valley Stakes,-St. Albans Handicap (4fur., 8.9), V.A.T.O.
Juvenile Stakes (sfur., 8.7), Oakleigh Purse (ojfur., 8.11)
A.J.O. Easter Stakes (7fur., 8.7)), South Australian
Derby, Toorak Handicap (7.13), and V.R.C. Derby. By
Wallace from La Tosca, by Robinson Crusoe, from
Nightmare, by Panic, F.J.A. is full brother to crack
2-year-old Class, and was bred by the late W. R. Wilson,
and sold one of the cheapest yearlings of his time. Time
(2.365) for the race equals record put up by Abundance
last year. Three hqlf-mile sections were covered in 53J,
51-$, and 514, and final 6fur. in lmin. 18$sec. —all inferior
to Lord Cardigan’s figures for same distances same day.
*** ' *
F.J.A.’s Derby was, without a doubt, the most
brilliantly won race in the history of V.R.C. blue-ribbon
contests. Newhaven-has been talked of as a phenomenal
Derby victor, because the red chestnut colt ran right
away, all the way, from seven commoners in moderately
fast time. F.J.A. made the running from end to end,
afid the race was 3see. faster than Newhaven's. Abun-
dance is the only previous winner to equal F.J.A.’s time
(2.365.), but whereas the big horse had the advantage of a
pacemaker in Great Scot, and could only catch him at the
distance post and win by-a length,'the little son of
Wallace was never approached bv any of his pursuers
save Sweet NeJI. Having shaken'off the filly, he came
clean away again and won by 2£ lengths. A great per-
formance. On returning to the “birdcage” k’-J-A.
nibbled the grass unconcernedly and looked fit to run
another Derby, whilst Sweet Nell, the runner-up. was
“all out.”
* * * •
Of course, the win-was a disappointment to the
crowd that backed Emir or Sweet Nell, yet the boo-hoos
of the punters and their roars of “ flub him out 1 ” (mean-
ing Rupert Clarke) only went to show their disregard of
all sporting considerations beyond the fact that they
had dropped- their coin. "It was the colt’s third
outing this season. He won the S.A. Derby; then
he took the Toorak Handicap at Caulfield, thereby earn-
ing a 71b. penalty for the Cup; and now he had put
up a record classic performance. “All lovers of a
good IjorSe,” to use a cant newspaper phrase, should
have cheered this remarkable pony. in hooting
him the hooters proved themselves to be frauds as
regards their professed fondness for sport. It’s a
successful bet that they really love, without regard
for consistency, or inconsistency, in the “form”
of the nag that has landed their wagers for them. Had
F.J.A. been palpably pulled to admit of Rupert’s popular
candidate winning the mob would have winked its other
eye and cheered lustily, but because the two game bits of
horseflesh represented the one owner on their respective
merits, and the result didn’t suit the public pocket, there
was a doleful reiteration of “ Rub him out ” from Hill
and Flat. As for Emir’s bearing on the case that is a
different story. Emir, owned by Rupert Clarke’s brother,
ought to have been the boss three-year-old of Scobie’s
Stable, judging from the suggestions of excellence (as a
galloping machine) that the big brown deceiver has shown
in public and private. He can out-sprint the lot of them
at times, and he is built to stay—but he doesn’t stay. On
paper Emir had done quite enough work to make him fit
to win the Derby, but he hadn’t grown very muscular on
it. He is said to have grown vicious, like Carnage of
yore, and if rumor, tells the truth, Emir is no longer
worth talking about as a great horse, though the stable’s
faith in-the animal may continue to find cash expression
after the outside world has sized him up as a bad job.
The Derby race didn’t appear to distress Emir. He ran
as though he had a constitutional aversion to hard work,
and it would be interesting to know exactly what his
trainer had to say for and against the colt’s chance what
time Ikey Mo was pegging him back in the market. The
bookmakers apparently were betting on information re-
ceived.
/ * * * *
Also, one would like to know whether Lewis—
the “ first jockey ”of the stable—was given the option to
ride F.J.A. in preference to either Sweet Nell or Emir.
The whole question as to there being an excuse, or no
excuse, for the crowd’s demonstration against the Derby
winner, seejns to turn upon a paragraph published in
Melbourne Age on the morning of the. race. The Age
was officially advised that Lewis, “as leading jockey for
Scobie’s stable, has not yet made up his mind as to
whether he will ride Emir or Sweet Nell.” But it was
already decided that “F.J.A. would be ridden bv
Richardson, who won the Caulfield Cup on Sweet
Nfll.” Now, if Richardson is No. 2 jockey for
Soobie’s stable, how came it that he was appointed
to ride what from the wording of the Age para-
graph, was fairly assumed to be the stable’s No. 3
candidate? People in the “birdcage” who saw the
three Ballarat candidates saddled up and sent off to the
fray will also ask why it was that F.J.A., the outsider of
the trio, had the distinction of being waited upon to the last
by trainer and owner, who walked beside him, breathing
final instruqtions to Richardson after Sweet Nell had left
the birdcage unattended. The thousands of angry de-
monstrators on Hill and Flat hadn’t seen this mark of
stable distinction paid to F.J.A., or they might have boo-
hooed the louder when the numbers went up. Even as
it was, they raised the biggest noise of disapproval ever
heard at Flemington.
* * * *
Rupert Clarke cut a pitiable figure. He was
quite unnerved. Jockey Richardson also failed to rise to
the uproar of the occasion, for when the newspaper inter-
viewers came along to the dressing-room he laughingly
blurted out an unnecessary excuse for his victory: “ I
just rode the race as: I was told to ride. I was told to
make it a nice pace. No one else had the least interest in
it, only me, and I won the race to suit myself." Practi-
cally he was saying : “ Don’t blame, anybody else. Blame
me.” But what had boy Richardson to be blamed for ?
And why did Rupert terremble and turn pale, like a poli-
tician on the hustings getting a first experience of his
constituency’s rotten eggs ?
* * * »
Wakeful put up a record in winning Melbourne
Stakes for the third year in succession. Lord Cardigan
and Rhapsody carried a stone more than their Cup
weights, while Wakeful humped 161 b. less. The S’Aus-
tralian candidate, Sojourner, staggered his followers by
finishing at the tail end of the field, behind St. Ambrose,
the English-bred horse having dropped back after making
one little rush which brought him into brief notice.
* * * *
An enormous Derby crowd came to rejoice and
remained to grieve at Flemington last Saturday. It was
a disastrous occasion for punters in general, and Vic-
torians in particular. An odds-on favorite got beaten for
the Maiden Plate ; the two rival idols from Scobie’s stable
succumbed to the 6 to 1 Bee Bee in the Maribyrnong, and
a 15 to 1 chance took the Hotham Handicap from the
others that carried good money. Then came the Derby
howl of anguish. Coburg Stakes went to the despised
Graft, and another outsider won the Encourage Stakes.
Wakeful, at 2 to 1 on, was the only victorious favorite of
the day, but none of the small punters dreamed of going
for a “ recovery ”on the mare. About 80 per cent, of the
crowd backed a loser every time, and went home in a
moody, broody state of mind. Even Ikey Mo was thought-
ful. A few more such days might mean a mortal sickness
for the public goose that lays the golden eggs, and Ike
doesn’t want the goose to be a dead bird.
* * * »
A Melbourne stockbroker tells a lovely tale of
a misunderstanding between himself and the boy who
rode a particular gee-gee for the first time. He (the
owner) had every reason to believe in the jockey’s
honesty, but in this instance he felt morally certain that
the house was stopped at a critical point of the race. So
he decided to inquire carefully into the matter, leading
off with a simple question. “ What do you think of the
colt?” he asked. The unsatisfactory rider grinned
meaningly and replied “ It’s a good ’un : I could’ve won
easy." “ Then why the devil didn’t you ? ” thundered the
owner. The amazed mannikin cleared his character by
tersely explaining the situation. “ When I was going to
the post, you told me you didn’t mean to back the ’orse
but would,,just let him run for the stake. Well, I thort
that was yfer perlite way of telling me to pull ’is blanky
’ead off.” ®
* * • •
Sydney stables scored well on Derby day with
three winners. (Bee Bee, Graft, and Sarto), and place-
getters Jacobite, Bewitcher, Koopan, Belah, Lord Cardi-
gan, Air Motor, and Famous.
* * * •
Huge surprise of V.R.C.’s Spring meeting, first
day (Saturday), was Martyr’s runaway win of Hotham
Handicap (l}m.). Though among the best known of Vic-
torian nags, she had never annexed a big thing before,
and figured mostly in jumpers’ flat races. At the post
rider had to dismount half-a-dozen times while one man
led and another pushed the mare to the barrier.
* * » *
Consider the clip at which Lord Cardigan cut
the running in Melbourne Stakes on Saturday—first
quarter 27}, second 50}, last half-mile 51}, and concluding
6 furlongs 1.17}.
» * » *
Bee Bee’s win of Maribyrnong Plate in lmin.
2sec. is the speediest recorded, bar Duke of Grafton’s
I.l} last year. She was bred by her owner at Motto
Farm, near Newcastle (N.S.W.), and is by Haut Brion
(imp.) from that beauty Ohand Bee Bee (imp.), by Royal
Hampton out of Miss Baba, by Springfield from Gunga
Joe, by Orlando. Bee Bee is half-sister to Chantress,
winner of last Newmarket Handicap and Futurity Stakes!
Stake secured is among biggest of the meeting. Bee Bee is
the 15th filly to score in the same event, and latest was the
14th occasion of a N.S.W. rep. succeeding. Also interest-
ing that only when the event was first run (32 years ago)
did a smaller field than last Saturday’s line up.
Ballarat sport, Mr. Wm. Bailey, owner of hot
favorite Hauturier—who went so badly wrong in a gallop
on Sunday as to necessitate immediate scratching—and
indicate that that fine animal will never race again, seems
destined not to win a Melbourne Cup. Still, he has
gathered more than a fair share of V.R.O. Derbies. Cocos
and Hautvillers were his, and he had an interest in each
of two other winners—Suwarrow and Camoola.
* * * *
Remarkable how the halt and the lame of the
Cup nags of Saturday and Sunday and Monday morning
came into the betting Monday night. Wakeful was
given out a very doubtful starter, and yet a heap of coin
went on her subsequently, and she ran second. Flag-
ship, alleged to be more fit for hospital than racing,
carried heavy investments—lumps of which came after
his “ break-down," ditto Ossian, Sojourner, and The
Idler. Marvellous what a great restorative lengthened
odds prove for the stiff 'uns of the turf.

“M.” writes: Re par. by “E. and 0.E.”
(8., 8/10/’O3) on W.A. racing. “E. and 0.E.” evidently
knows very little of racing in this State. Does he know
of any other place in Australia where an owner can start
a horse in a £lOOO Cup for a tenner ? If he only took
the trouble to look up the prize-money given away during
the past five years on the goldfields, he would discover
that the owners are being well catered for. As to the
leading clubs trying to make their courses compare with
the best in other States, Kalgoorlie and Boulder have
succeeded in doing so. A large amount of money has
been spent on each course, and they are used by the
people as parks. There is no other State so free from
welchers. There has only been one case at the Boulder,
one at Ooolgardie, and two at Kalgoorlie since racing
started on the fields. There has not been one case of
welching on metropolitan courses during the past
five years. Bookmakers are not allowed to bet on
any course in W.A. unless they are licensed by
the W.A. Turf Club. The majority of bookmakers
privileged to bet have shops of their own, and are mem-
bers of recognised betting clubs. Racing is not overdone
on the fields, and there is no more racing here until
March, with the exception of a charity meeting at the
Boulder, next month, when £250 will be given in stakes,
and the proceeds divided among local charities; £4OO
was realised at a similar meeting last year. There are no
proprietary clubs on the goldfields, and the management
of racing is in good hands. Nomination and acceptance
fees are the lowest in the Commonwealth, and book-
makers’ fees the highest. The writer knows several
bookmakers who have been paying as much as £5OO a
year for license fees. Dates for racing are arranged in
conference each year between the goldfields’ clubs and
the W.A. Turf Club. The proprietary clubs are not
recognised at the annual conference, and have to take a
back seat in the control of racing.

“J.A.C.”: A well-known Sydney publican
relates a remarkable racing dream. The night before a
big race he saw, in the visions of his head upon his bed,
a certain horse winning—horse, jockey, eolors were all
clear and past dispute. He told a friend, and two deeply
impressed men hurried out early to keep ahead of the
rush and get the odds from a shop Hebrew—a Hebrew
who seemed to have a strange vibration in the left eye.
Then they went to the course—and learned that their
horse had died that same morning. Hence the vibration
in the Hebrew’s eye.
* * * *
Telegraphed Monday that drawer (a Maclean
N.S.W., resident) of then first favorite (Abundance) in
Melbourne Cup sweep sold his chance for £5OO, which
was a most ill-advised proceeding, for Monday saw the
horse at fives, with sixes eagerly snapped up wherever
available. Drawer of Abundance could have laid off
£3OOO to £5OO and had the substantial balance coming to
himself if the horse won, but if he ran second or third
the £5OO would still be the drawer’s atop of place-money.
Sale was a handsomely profitable thing for the buyer,
who could straightway have laid-off to secure his £5OO
and then stood on velvet with the prospect of winning
£3OOO (half the first prize), or getting second or third
place-money (substantial sums in each instance), or, at
worst, pocketing Abundance's share as a starter. Almost
as good a spec, at the time was a Melbourne Mo’s
purchase of a Hauturier ticket for £7OO, but the scratch-
ing, on Monday, of the nag put a different complexion
on the transaction, though in the meantime the “ book”
had laid off so as to secure something in excess of his
investment.

Most ancient nags in Melbourne Cup were

“Marat”: What surprises one most in the
proceedings of the N.S.W. Select Committee on gambling
is the talkative egotistical manner of a few small fielders
hauled up to be questioned. One would expect bookies
to be a close-mouthed crowd who button up on every-
thing, but it seems otherwise. To judge by the evidence
of one small fielder, pony racing throughout the State is
under his sole control. Ikey is chock-full of vanity when
he gets a good opportunity, with a reporter intelligent
enough to translate his nasal gibberish into plain
Australianese—to understand, for instance, when he
mentions a “ horth ” that he means a bloomin’ moke.
* * * *
“E. and O. E.”: “L.W.” is quite right. For
“line” writing nowadays it is necessary to read the sport-
ing columns of the daily press. No racing reporter worthy
the name owns acquaintance with the weather ; for him
“ the meteorological conditions " are perfect—or other-
wise. The turf is “the green sward”; the first race
always “ starts the ball rolling ” ; betting in the ring
becomes a “ never-ending battle between the metallicians
and the punters ” ; the starters are “ competitors ” ; there
is a “ solemn hush ” as the horses line up to the barrier
and “ a stentorian cry of ‘They’re off!’ from thousands
of throats.” Of course as they “ flash past the post no
one but the judge can tell what has won,” and invariably
“ the gentleman in the box ” decides in favor of some-
thing or other. _ For years have I studied the racing
reports, and enjoyed them, but two unfamiliar gems
recently exalted me. “ The withdrawals are sufficiently
sparse to portend good fields ” strikes me as original.
And if “ the automatic dispenser of odds” has been used
before, I have not noticed it. The young man had
already said totalisator once in the sentence ; to repeat
the word would be a violation of all literary precedent.

“ C.P.” : The walking disease threatens to
undermine the health of the community. Already whole
business establishments are under its influence. It
usually starts this way. Smith, the accountant, appar-
ently in the best of health the night befcire, will put in an
appearance at the office one morning intoxicated with a
desire to walk to Brighton, or Botany, or Timbuctoo, or
anywhere. Not that he has any desire to go there, but
the disease is on'him, and he must walk. It is a mere
detail that Smith has probably not walked more than 400
yards a day in one stretch for 10 years or more. The
complaint is as contagious as measles in a public school,
and by lunch time everyone from the junior messenger to
the general manager is feeling his leg muscles and telling
how he used to be able to do his eight miles an hour
without turning a hair. Of course, they get up a match,
and the railway revenue suffers for a week while the
competitors get into form. It always rains on the day,
but that makes no difference. The consumptive ledger-
keeper and the accountant—who weighs 15st. 131 b.—start
off limit and go at a tremendous pace, the telegraph posts
slipping by at quite three miles an hour. As they near the
Tied House the pace is tremendous. A few minutes
later brewery shares go up with a jump, and there’s a
peculiar gurgling sound in the bar parlor. Then the
accountant starts back for his clothes. The invoice clerk
win? and gets so cocky afterwards that the member of
the Employers’ Federation, with a protuberance under
his vest, who runs the show from the office with the
glass door, decides that work is interfering with his sport,
so gives him his walking ticket. The consumptive book-
keeper doesn’t turn up for a month through an attack of
bronchitis or pneumonia, and the whole establishment
looks like a casualty ward. But it’s not in the office
only the epidemic rages. Postmen who travel something
short of 200 miles a day are just as susceptible, and after
delivering Saturday’s mail walk 12 miles with their
tongues out, and call it pleasure. The blacksmith comes
home after eight hours with the sledge-hammer, and
after tea starts out to get what he calls a little exercise so
as to be ready for Saturday. A man won’t argue a point
nowadays; he’ll walk you ten miles to decide whether
Protection or Freetrade is best, and the man who arrives
at the pub last has to change his views there and then.

Warner’s second ’Ome team opens its tour in
Adelaide, Saturday this week. Twelve, from whom 11
to meet visitors will be chosen on Friday, includes
Evans, Rees and Hay, who were not known in inter-State
matches last season. First-named figured on S.A. side
several times, but last year wasn’t included in 11 that
played Victoria or N.S.W., though he shaped against the
Englishmen. Rees is a colt who has done well all round
in club cricket. Hay did big things when opposed to
Warner’s first team, bagging 9 wickets for 8 runs each.
Expected that Hay will be troublesome and help make
up, to some extent, for retirement from big cricket of
Trumble.

Marsh, the aborigine, threatens to again be a
thorn in the side of N.S.W. Cricket Association. He
simply routed the Leichhardt-Balmain team in the first
match he played this season. Further, no new blood
worth mentioning has appeared at the bowling crease,
and last year’s lot, which was a poor lot then, seems
poorer this year. The job of finding an excuse for not
playing Marsh is going to be a large contract.

“ S.T.S.” • Re Colonial Secretary Lyttelton and
his wicketkeeping. The match, in 1884 (B. 22/10/’O3),
when he had to bowl, and did bowl surprisingly well,
was notable for two more points. Not only did the
whole English side take a turn with the ball while
Murdoch and co. had them collared, but W. G Grace
fielded in every position in the field. He bad done every-
thing except keep wicket, and he took the gloves when
Lyttelton relinquished them. Meanwhile some unknown
clever person was qualifying for the post of champion
Mean Man. He drove up in a cab to Lyttelton’s house
while the latter was saving his country (the match was
drawn), pitched a tale about A.L. being detained at the
Oval, and obtained his overcoat and dressing-bag—which
were never heardof again.

The 14 English cricketers now in Australia
played among them last English season 486 completed
innings for 15,728 runs with an average of 32 36. Cen-
turies to their credit total 183,' thus : Havward 41
Tyldesley 31, the skipper and Hirst 21 each, Foster 16,
Knight 15, Braurid 15, Lilley 10, Bosanquet 7, Arnold 6,
Keif 2, Rhodes 1. First-class cricket saw the side’s 9
bowlers get 862 wickets for 15,155 runs, averaging 17'58,
and all excepting one (Hayward) did better last than any
preceding season.

Sydney senior grade cricket had a batsman’s
day, Saturday. Young Hartigan (for North Sydney
against Sydney) hit up 116, which embraced two s’s and
? e century showing in 1) hours. Macka v notched
120 in Bur wood’s interests opposed to Glebe'. Victor
Trumper accumulated 134 against ’Varsity. Atop of 108
(not out) first innings Farquhar’s second effort for Central
Cumberland v. Leichhardt-Balmain brought 92 to the
total —200 for once out in a match.

The withdrawal of Trumble and Darling, which
seems pretty definite, leaves open the billet of captainim-
the locals in the coming series of test matches. An added
lustre to the position is that if the season’s captain proves
a success he will be cert: i.i to have the refusal of leadin"-
the twelfth Australian Eleven to England. The choice
lies between M. A. Noble and Clem Hill, who each
captains his State team, as Laver, the Victorian skipper
is not even sure of a place in the team for the tests’
The idea of a match between the visiting English
Eleven and a team of N.S.W. “colts” is an admirable
one—always provided that players who have taken part
in representative and inter-State cricket are left out.
Similar matches have taken place between “colts” and
visiting English teams, but in many cases the “colts”
have included has-beens of bygone days.

Young South Sea Island native, “ Alicb ’

him shoot through the water at a surprising rate, but last

Championship catch-as-catch-can ’rastle, ’tween
Hindus Buttan Singh and Gunga Brahm at Sydney
National S.O., was the most exciting and interesting seen
for years in Sydney. Mostly, Gunga was on the defen-
sive, but not to nearly the same extent as at Wirth’s
Circus recently. His condition was better, and he shaped
more Confidently. Close calls were plentiful, principally
against Gunga, though he now and again played the part
of top dog. Half-an-hour after “ go ” Buttan secured a
half-Nelson with the left and a leg hold with the right,
and steadily worked Gunga over on to both shoulders
(legs uppermost), amid intense excitement. Seven
minutes’ spell (they wouldn’t have any more, though
conditions provided for 16) and Gunga rushed his man.
For 6min. they forced and bumped with great fury, when
Gunga, immediately after escaping a full-Nelson, got
t’other’s right arm between his elbow and ribs, and,
securing a powerful leg hold, forced Buttan to one
shoulder and, pressing all weight available, worked him
on to the other point. House cheered uproariously. Six
minutes’ spell, and both operated viciously. First Brahm
and then Singh rushed. The tussle bristled with
clever' moves, till Buttan brought the hammerlock to
bear, and, aided by a firm leg hold, had Gunga settled,
despite a desperate resistance, and, levering him over,
scored the winning fall and the right to continue cham-
pion. Singh offered to any man on the conti-
nent and throw him three times before being thrown
himself once, but there was no response.

A feature of the late series of Rifle matches
was the eclipse of the picked Kolapore shots who went
to Bisley last year. They were most of them engaged
but were put down by the stay-at-home pot-hunters.
Truly the “ King’s," the chief event, was won by Soden of
Queensland who was one of the team. But though he
went to Bisley he was not finally selected as one of the
team which managed to win the cup.

Ebony bruiser Starlight, aged 50, and who has
retired “ for good ” thrice as often as Patti, shaped in
Melbourne, last week, through sheer necessity. He
bested local champion Jim Higgins from end to end of
six rounds, though the white started a 2 to 1 on favorite.
Higgins cried enough, alleging that his back was hurt.
Previously, when the same two clashed, Starlight
“chucked it” through a broken wrist. Australian
bruiserdomis all cripples, apparently; including Doherty,
whose hands went back on him in the Scanlan fight, and
champion M‘Ooll, who still nurses a lame shoulder,
sustained in his roughing tussle, three months ago, with
Biter Scanlan.

the O.T. scribe ; also, very crude “ Ironbark ” Burge, who
relied solely on his capacity for punishment to see the
other man out in a fight to a finish.

A Melbourne correspondent:—
The Dry Dog’s bark at Melbourne Town Hall on Friday
last was but a mild yap compared to former efforts. The
Man with the Monocle seemed dispirited after his cool
reception in the Northern Districts,-where, on an average,
the station-master and the local Jaypee were the only
people to “welcome" him. The “Freetrade” organisa-
tion, of which a person named Renwick is secretary, had
“distributed” tickets (nominally at 2s. and Is. apiece)
lavishly among such as were likely to cheer for the im-
porting “Cause,” and had whipped up every “Free-
trader ” in Victoria except the Abrahamses —whose
Sabbath was on. Hickford, a little clean-shaven
man, sat in the chair—a huge affair—and
reclined back in its cavernous depths, looking for all the
world like a sparrow in a kerosene tin. To the right of
George sat foolish old Simon Fraser, who said “Har!
liar ! ” every time Reid alluded to the price of wheat), and
“illimitable tracts of water,” or “the extremely in-
telligent Victorian workers”—just as if Fraser knew
anything about intelligence ! On George’s left sat Robert
Reid, of the painfully well-known importing firm
of Robert Reid and Co. The front of the “house” had
been most carefully packed, so that when the eye-glass
and shirt-front of George ascended the horizon at least a
regulation “ burst of applause ” might be provided. Even
if it hadn’t been, the fortunate presence of the Ap„gus
would have remedied the deficiency next day. What
George talked about doesn’t matter. His most notable
utterance was the half-veiled threat that if he “ didn’t
get a show ” (what a showman it is !) Deakin wouldn’t get
one in Sydney.

The Jenkins Iscariot Government has
closed up S.A. Parliament after a very short
session. (S.A. had a 20-days’ session in 1875, and
a two-days’ session in 1881, and a four-days’
session in 1887, but for some reason an ill-informed
Sydney daily paper described the one just eflded
as the shortest on record.) It was a disastrous
time. The Jenkins Government first proposed to
keep the finances square by renewing the extra
in the £ land-tax imposed last session, but the
Assembly threw out the proposal. _ Then it pro-
posed a re-assessment of land to see if it could get
some extra revenue that way, but the Council
threw that out and replaced, the land tax.
The Assembly threw that out again. Then,
having been licked three times, the Jenkins
Iscariot Ministry closed the session in disgust.
Mr. O. O. JOHNSON, Loemis, Neb., January
12, 1899, writes :: /
“I have used Jayne’s Expectorant for the last thirty
years, and believe it to be the BEST COUGH REMEDY
KNOWN.”*
An episode at George Reid’s Melbourne
meeting (Sydney Telegraph’s report):—
It was a hypocritical pretence to seek to exclude
colored races by submitting their own countrymen to an
education test. This was an incident of the weakness of
the Government in giving way to the dictation of the
Labor party.
A Voice : Did you vote for it ?
Mr Reid: No.
The Voice : You did.
Mr. Reid : If I did I was wicked. (Laughter.)
It takes a tolerably brassy front to laugh when
bowled out so badly as that.
The fact that the See Government has
been licked at Glen Innes (N.S.W.) bye-election
doesn’t amount to much in the way of a surprise ;
the See Government is licked everywhere these
days. The most interesting feature of the case was
that at Glen Innes both parties were against
reduction of members. Yet both See and Car-
ruthers have declared in favor of it in the
Assembly. And neither wants it, and each
accuses the other of not wanting it, and each
repudiates the insinuation with anger, and neither
does anything.
Marriage and Health.
Married men live longer than single men. So,
at least, a study of the United States census
returns would seem to indicate. But though
marriage may be conducive to longevity, it
certainly does not secure immunity from indiges-
tion, biliousness, and the host of weakening and
distressing ailments which have their origin in a
disordered stomach and a torpid liver. Yet even
that may be secured by the timely and regular
use of Mother Seigel’s Syrup, a natural and
digestant made of fruits, roots and herbs. _ 1 or
several years I was a martyr to indigestion and
flatulence,” says Mr. Blackie, of Post Office
Chambers, Auckland, N.Z. “My cure was
effected about four years ago by Mother Seigel s
Syrup. I experienced relief before the first bottle
was finished. Eight bottles completely restored
me to health.”*
Rumored that Alexander Hay, defeated at
Glen Innes, is not to be dropped unhonpred into
the ranks of the defeated. “ He will in every
respect ornament the N.S. W. Legislative Coun-
cil,” is the expression going the rounds. See’s
first appointment to the Legislative Council was
Solicitor Fitzgerald, when that monument of
eloquent silence was similarly refused a seat., The
Council is a place where the man who can’t be
trusted to help at running the country’s business
for three years is sent so that he may help to run
the country’s business for life.
Preacher “ Elijah ” Dowie, of the wings,
has created a sensation,*according to cable report,
by claiming to be the illegitimate son of' a duke,
which seems rather a rough thing to say about his
mother. What with his cold reception in New
York, where there were no converts, and the
takings didn’t pay for gas, and 3000 of his
followers sneezing simultaneously, and the
accusation that he was about to leave with the
cash, or that his wife had already left with the
cash, and his own influenza, Dovyie’s stock seems
rather low just now.

“ Melbourne’’ : Was waiting for a suburban
train, the other night, when about half of it came
up to the platform. The guard had to climb out
and walk along a drain some 50 yards before he
could climb on to the platform. He was pretty
wild then. Signalled the driver to draw lip level
with the platform. Driver evidently took it for the
starting sign, proceeded to get full steam on, and
was only recalled by vigorous whistling. When
he backed in again the guard asked him, in quite a
savage voice, what kind of pea-nut barrow he used
to drive before he blacklegged. The driver care-
fully recorded the remark, and that guard will
probably be hauled up to explain.
THE AUSTRALIAN GEM TRADE.
H. Newman, the well-known jeweller of 175
Elizabetlpst., Melbourne, is the largest buyer of
Opals, Sappliires, Pearls and other Australian
gems, and consignors will find it to their advantage
to send their parcels direct to him. The firm has
a reputation for straight-dealing, extending over a
period of 40 years, which is a sufficient guarantee
that they will be honorably treated. A trial par
cel, which will be followed by direct remittance
is solicited
When Town Clerk Clayton, of Melbourne,
returned from his wanderings round the globe the
principal thing he brought back with him was an
idea, picked up in some cold climate, how to
prevent the dust nuisance. The method consisted
in applying a thin coating of tar to the roadways.
So long as the weather was cool the system
worked splendidly, but the first really hot day the
tar melted, and every citizen who crossed the road
gathered on his boots a sticky mass about the size
of a hen, and when he tried to walk on the pave-
nient.bShad to tear each foot loose as if he was
struggling to drag payment of a just debt out of a
Kyabram farmer. Then the public spoke dis-
paragingly about Clayton, just as if he was one of
Bent’s engines. So, to dry up the tar, a thick
layer of sand was laid down, which immediately
proceeded to fly about and deposit itself in the
lunch. Not that a man objects to sand for lunch,
but he prefers to have it on a separate plate.
Consequently Melbourne was worse than before
Clayton had his great idea. Finally the council
fell back the good old system of watering, and
the ladies held up their skirts as usual.
FOR CONSTIPATION.
For consfipn'ion there is nothing quite so nice
as CHAM IE,PLAIN’S STOMACH AND
LIVER TABLETS. They always remove the
trouble, without any disagreeable effect. Cham-
berlain’s stomach and liver tablets are “.Just
What You Need.’’ Sold every where. Is. 6d."'
A peculiar argument in defence in a
Sydney court, where an accused was charged with
not accounting for all the sums of money entered
on his charity list:—
In some cases where people subscribed 2s. 6d. it might
be entered as 7s. 6d. or 10s., as an encouragement to
others to contribute liberally. In the collecting lists of
various churches it was a recognised thing that many
persons were put down for £5, £10, or £20, who never
paid up a single shilling.
In Christchurch (M.L.) the town refuse,
including the remains of the stray dog, is burned
in a destructor, and the heat from the destructor
generates electricity for the supply of the town.
This keeps Christchurch very clean and quiet, for
if the proper officials don’t bring in enough refuse
and stray dog to keep the machinery going there
is trouble. Their anxiety to clean up amounts
almost to a disease.

A queer-grained Maorilander recently
p -titioned for restitution of conjugal rights, and
i.reatlied a pathetic story into the ear of the
bench. He stated that his vvife was a bit unruly
sometimes, but he didn’t mind ; she had gone to
town to renew the lease of the farm, had renewed
the lease' in her own name, kicked him out,
refused to hand over his clothes, threatened to
1 rain him with an axe, and done other sundries.
So he had to take another farm on his own
account. He incidentally mentioned that the
lady was a great religious enthusiast, and had
sampled various brands, including Anglican,
Presbyterian and that of the Dippers. At present
she was a red-hot Dipper. The court couldn’t con-
ceive of a man in his position looking for further
trouble, but granted his petition on general
principles.
HAVE YOU
A BAD LEG
with Wounds that Discharge or otherwise, perhaps sur-
rounded with inflammation and swollen that when you
l>re«s your finger on the inflamed part it leaves the impres-
sion V If so, under the skin you have poison that defies al*
the remedies you have tried, which, if not extracted, you
never can recover, but go on suffering till death releases
you. Perhaps your knees are swollen, the joints being
ulcerated; the same with the ankles, round which the skin
may be discoloured, or there may be wounds ; the disease
if allowed to continue will deprive you of the power to
walk. You may have attended various hospitals and had
medical advice, and been told your case is hopeless, or
advised to submit to amputation ; but do not, for I CAN
CURE YOU. I don’t say perhaps ; but I WILL. Because
others have failed is no reason for not how being cured.

HAVE YOU NOTICED IT?
That a crooked arm or leg on a child at
once excites your pity; that it excites all" the
more pity if you reflect that there is no neces-
sity for thi3 deformity ? It proceeds in most
cases from Rickets. Rickets is a disease in
which the bones are deficient in their earthy
constituents, and consequently have lost their
natural hardness; they beoome soft, like
gristle, and somewhat brittle, so that they
are not only easily bent, but easily broken.
Rickets is generally associated with a ten-
dency to scrofula —either hereditary or en-
gendered by poor living and unhealthy in-
fluences, such as deficient ventilation and
light, damp, impure air, and bad food.
HAVE YOU NOTICED IT?
You must have done so, if a case has come
under your eyes where Scott’s Emulsion was
given to the child, how quickly Rickets is
relieved, and then cured, by a course of
Scott’s Emulsion ! Scott’s Emulsion checks,
relieves, and finally removes Rickets, sup-
plying to the bones the missing earthy con-
stituents, thus restoring their natural hard-
ness, and cleaning the blood of all sorofulous
taint.
SCOTT'S EMULSION do » t hi.b y
direct action as a medicine, and by indirect
action as a tonic food, which strengthens, and
so helps the vital organs to throw off the
disease. If, therefore, you notice any weakness
in children specially manifest in their limbs,
send at once for Scott’s Emulsion, which will
give them a straight arm and a straight leg.
You have only one precaution to take; and
that is to see that on the wrapper of the
bottle there is a picture of a man carrying a
big cod-fish; if that cod-fish is not there, you
are not getting what we promise you-—a cure !
You can obtain a sample of Scott’s Emulsion,
and the choicest children’s booklet of the
year, “A Bunch of Roses,” beautifully printed
in colours, by sending sd. to Scott & Bowne,
Ltd., 483 Kent Street, Sydney, and mentioning
this paper. All chemists sell Scott’s Emulsion.

DEATH!
The'cold clasp of Death will inevitably enfold each and all of us at last, but Science has given many
of us the means of postponing: the dread embrace until our tale of years is spent, and it would be the
height of folly to refrain from availing ourselves of the aid winch knowledge affords. Death is
hastened by ignorance. Nature has endowed us with the sense of pain, solely in order that, by seek-
ing relief, we may avoid playing into the hands of death. When we feel pain we are out of health.
Pain long endured is a strain upon the system which nature cannot withstand. Many of us, however,
go on suffering certain kinds of pain, just as if Science could not come to the help of her sister Nature.
There is, for instance, no necessity for anyone to suffer from
Rheumatism
Gout
Neuralgia
Backache
Sciatica
Indigestion
Anaemia
Blood Disorders
Biliousness
Jaundice
Gravel
Stone
Bladder Troubles
General Debility
Sick Headache
The pains caused by this long list of disorders are but Nature’s means of letting us know that the
kidneys or liver are for some reason unable to perform their work efficiently, for all of these dis-
orders are produced by the retention in the system of urinary and biliary poisons, which would be
thrown off naturally if the kidneys and liver were doing their duty. Few people realise how important
in the scheme of life is the healthy action of the kidneys and the liver, therefore the following
description of the functions of those vital organs will be of the deepest interest to many.
The Kidneys filter and extract from the blood about three pints of urine every day. In this
quantity of urine are dissolved about an ounce of urea, ten to twelve grains in weight, of uric acid,
together with other animal and mineral matter varying from a third of an ounce to nearly an ounce.
When the kidneys are in health, all this solid matter is in solution and is invisible. Directly the
kidneys, through either weakness or disease, become unfit to do their duty properly, a proportion of
the solid matter remains in the blood, becomes actively poisonous, and causes us to suffer from uric
disorders such as Rheumatism, Gout, Neuralgia, Lumbago, Backache, Sciatica, Gravel,
Stone, Bladder Troubles and Bright’s Disease. A simple test to make as to the condition of
the kidneys is to place some urine, passed the first thing in the morning, in a covered glass,_ and let it
stand until next morning. If it is then cloudy, or there is a brick-dust like sediment, or if particles
float about in it, or it is of an unnatural color, the kidneys are not healthy, and no time must be lost in
adopting remedial measures, or Bright’s Disease, Diabetes, or some less serious but more painful,
illness will result.
The Liver. —In the liver various substances are actually made from the blood. Two or three-
pounds of bile are thus made from the blood every day. The liver takes sugar from the blood,
conyerts it into another form, and stores it up so as to be able to again supply it to the blood!
gradually, as the latter requires enrichment. The liver changes uric acid, which is insoluble, into-
urea, which is completely soluble, and the liver also deals with blood corpuscles which have lived their
life and are useful no longer. When the liver is inactive or diseased we suffer from Indigestion,.
Biliousness, Ansemia, Sick Headache and Blood Disorders.
The health of the liver and of the kidneys is so closely connected that it is almost impossible for
the kidneys to be affected and the liver to remain healthy, or vice versa.
It is nearly thirty years since scientific research, directed specially to diseases of the Kidneys and
Liver, was rewarded by the discovery of the medicine now known throughout the world as
Warner’s Safe Cure.
It was realised, at the outset of the investigation, that it was necessary to find a curative agent which
would act equally upon the kidneys and upon the liver, these organs being so immediately associated
in the work of dealing with the body’s waste material, and after many disappointments, the medicine
which possessed the required action in the fullest degree was at length discovered. Warner’s Safe
Cure cures all diseases of the kidneys and liver, and, by restoring their activity, these vital
organs are enabled to rid the body, through the natural channels, of the urinary and biliary poisons,
the presence of which, in the system, are the cause of Rheumatism, Gout, Neuralgia, Lumbago, Back-
ache, Sciatica, Blood Disorders, Anaemia, Indigestion, Biliousness, Jaundice, Sick Headache, Gravel,
Stone, Bladder Troubles, and General Debility. Warner’s Safe Cure cures all these disorders simply
by removing the cause of the disorder. This is the reason why cures effected by Warner’s Safe Cure
are permanent cures. [1&

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
They want a Rep-re-sent-a-tive
Who’s only half-a-man;
They want a thing who’ll cadge them jobs,
From Beersheba to Dan ;
They want a fraud who’ll creep for votes
And kiss the voter’s toe,
Who’ll meekly slobber every friend,
And fawn on every foe.
They do not care for prin-ci-ples —
They do not soar so high ;
Their man must raid the Treasuree,
Or make a desperate ti*y ;
They’ll sing his praises far and wide,
In cottage and in dome,
If only safe he’ll bring them back
The public plunder home.
They keep his pocket well in view,
Their fingers in his purse ;
And he must smile and smile and smile,
And never dare to curse.
To Sect and Club and Hospital,
To College and to School,
They make him his donation send —
The Legislative Fool!
They keep his brain upon the strain,
His nose upon the stone,
The gorgeous title —M.L. A.—
Is all he calls his own ;
They suck him like an orange dry,
Then throw him lightly down,
And choose upon next polling day
His rival —Draper Brown.
He starts, perhaps, with open brow,
With bosom kind and warm,
Perhaps because he’s somewhere heard
The country craves “ Reform ! ”
He finds the country only cares
For him whose cunning toil
Can carve for those who sent him in
The lion’s share of spoil.
And when he’s done with “ Public Life ”
And laid his honors down,
lie gaily cracks the village stones
To gain an honest crown ;
He cracks the stones and cracks a joke
And drains a jolly can,
For now he’s put the Statesman off
He dare put on the Man !
Q-
PHILANDER FLAM.
The Development of the Woman Voter.
The M.L. National Council of Women has cut
itself clear of the influence of the narrow-minded,
bloodless Gimlet Brigade, and lately adopted this
broadly-liberal and humane set of resolutions :
(1) That the time has come to remove all legal disquali-
fications from illegitimate children. (2) That the State
should make generous provision for the maintenance,
supervision and education of such children, the parents
being compelled to contribute according to their means.
(3) That, when paternity is proved, such children should
possess a legal status equal to other children, being regis-
tered in the father’s name. (4) That a female officer be
appointed to discover parentage before birth. (5) That
Government be urged to establish homes for such children
and for destitutes.
With a few conspicuous exceptions, the women
who first take up politics are hard, stern female
frequenters of prayer-meetings, who haven’t any-
thing to offer a “ fallen ” sister but a tract or a
turn at the washtub at greatly reduced wages.
M.L. and S. Australian experience proves, though,
that this sort doesn’t have the field to herself
for long. The whole crowd of womankind
soon Btarts in; and not having much per-
sonal knowledge of politics, the crowd votes for
one of two kinds of men—the particularly
well-known man, even if he doesn’t pose as a
saint (Seddon, for instance, in M.L., or Kingston
in S.A.), or for a “good” man—a man of whom
the Rev. Obadiah Jones has spoken kindly. In
S. Australia, where Obadiah lives in great
numbers, the women have reached this stage.
Moreover, there, at Obadiah’s instigation, they
mostly vote for the “good” class of politician;
and the present awful collection of baby-kissing
mediocrities is the result. Of the four S. A. Minis-
ters Jenkins is patronised by the Methodies, and
attends their tea-meetings; Foster is an ex-
Methody parson; Gordon is a Presbyterian
parson's son; Butler lives on the favor of the
Anglican section. That represents the second
stage in the political apprentice-work of women.
And it is pleasant to think, anyhow, that the
M.L. resolutions, quoted above, are characteristic
of the third stage of development, when women will
collectively exercise in the community much the
same influence that woman individually exercises
in the household.
♦
“Chasselas”: Other States are not slow in
offering inducements to Victoria’s manhood,
which the calm, masterly policy of the Irvine-
Shiels combine is driving out of the country.
Westralian Government is making extraordinary
offers to farmers per medium of illustrations and
advertisements in Victorian weekly papers.
Amongst inducements are 160 acres of free land,
free survey, free railway trips whilst inspecting
land, and free vehicles and guides at nearest rail-
way stations. The ’Groper Government also
advertises that it has recently bought and cut up
several large estates, and will have them available
for closer settlement in suitable blocks shortly.
Already some of the Mallee farmers cultivating
land on the tenant system in S.W. Victorian
plains have taken up land in Westralia,
and are moving out, while more will follow
every month. They have no faith in Irvine’s
Compulsory Resumption of Land, and, even
if they had, recent mouthings of the Upper House
convince them that the Bill will be thrown out in
much the same fashion as was the Woman’s
Franchise Bill. Unless the Australian Govern-
ment will take a hand and impose a very heavy
graduated land-tax and absentee-tax, to break up
the big estates, there is nothing to hope for. Has
Premier Deakin any views on the subject ?
+
A fine old Sydney Tory, recently orating before
the Institute of Bankers, got so far on his wild
career of misrepresentation as to allege that the
socialistic Government of N. S.W. prohibits irriga-
tion, that work being reserved for the State.
There seems to be very little indeed in the way of
stupendous lying that a Tory won’t say when
once lie gets started. The N.S.W. Government
certainly looks rather coldly on persons who ask
to be allowed to seize upon a river, annex the
water, sell it at a high price to settlers, and pro-
vent anyone who doesn t pay their price using the
water. That isn’t irrigation so much as specula-
tion. But for everyone who wants to irrigate his
own land the Water Rights Act, passed by the
socialistic Parliament of N.S.W. in 1896, gives
the settler liberal privileges in the way of
damming rivers, creeks, &c., provided he
doesn’t want to take all the available water
and leave none for other settlers below
him. And it wasn’t till N.S.W. had a
socialistic Legislature that private irrigation was
rendered lawful in that State. In the old days,
when there was no Labor party, and the party
that the Institute of Bankers admires ran the
that tne institute or Hankers admires ran cue
show, _a man might dam a creek to provide him-
self with water for irrigation, but anybody had a
right to destroy his dam and ruin his irrigation
scheiiie. Ho could get absolutely no rights at all.
The insane policy of the Torv party made irriga-
tion nranl icallv imnnssible in NS W unless a
tion practically impossible in in.O.w., uni s
man defended his irrigation works with a gun.
But so well have things progressed under the new
law that from one Land District alone over 200
applications have been received for the right to
dam creeks and rivers for irrigation purposes, and
~n,. ” r 1 r
they were all granted, except where a man pro-
posed to annex practically the whole water sup-
ply. It was under the Institute of Bankers
friends that irrigation was illegal, and if it isn’t
ashamed of itself it ought to be.
" C.R.” writes
Patriots, through curse of circumstances, and poli-
ticians, by compulsion of the grocer, may stand idly by
and see Australia set aside as a card of no account in the
cut-throat game now being played in the Balkans. The
Czar of Russia, and the Kaisers of Austria and Germany,
and Edward the Seventh of England, and Albert of
Monaco, and Henry the Forty-ninth of Reuss, and the
Presidents of the Republics of Andorra and San Marino,
and other high European potentates may sit upon their
thrones, satisfied with saying “ Shoo i” and “ Shame ! ”
while Pavlofpaziz is hacking the head off Bismillahvitch,
and Hassan Karaosmanoff is shedding the blood of
StefanopolousSulif-manowsky. Probably these potentates
know something about the character of the persons named.
But Joe Cook, of the Federal House of Representatives, is
not that sort of heartless hairpin. He rose in his place, some
little time ago, and asked, in a voice husky with emotion,
“whether the Prime Minister would consider the advisa-
bility of cabling to the Imperial authorities the protest
of Australia against the continuance of atrocities in the
Balkans, and also of urging joint action with other
European Powers towards bringing the matter to a speedy
end.” The Prime Minister replied vaguely to the effect
that there was probably a good deal to be said on both
sides of the question, and that he felt some hesitation
about instructing the Imperial Government in the manner
suggested. Mr. Deakin has evidently lost a good deal of
the bright enthusiasm of his younger and less responsible
days, and after that vague answer he let things slides
They are still sliding, and our chance of smiting Abdul
the Damned in Stamboul, and throwing the Divan with a
great splash into the Sublime Porte, is being lost. I think
we should send a contingent to Macedonia.

, Owing to the number of unscrupulous imitators attempting to exploit a
trade which by virtue of the superiority of our machines we hold, we desire
to point out to intending purchasers:—
(1) That our machines are used solely by His Majesty’s Australian
Squadron, after an exhaustive trial, in which other so-called aerating
machines competed.
(2) That on all the Victorian Railway Refreshment Rooms, after careful
trial and examination, our machines were unanimously selected for
,o\ he excellence and purity of the aerated waters produced by them.
(3) That ■the leading Hotels and Clubs throughout Australasia have dis-
... .p ? a rded all other makes of machines and have given ours the preference.
(4) -Being by far the largest importers of Pure, Natural, Liquefied Carbonio
, in Australia, we can insure to purchasers of our machines an
unfailing supply of this gas.

Etheridge (N.Q.) is largely a field of blasted
hopes Its mines are little use to it without a railway,
and it can't get one. A Croydon to Georgetown railway
proposal has been twice before Parliament; both times it
looked like getting through, but finally was lost by a
small majority—once by only one vote. A while back,
when Chillagoe looked brighter than it does now, the
Lindsay Express Co. came on the scene ; it got a finger in
about two dozen of the most promising Etheridge shows,
and also took up a strip of country from Georgetown to
Chillagoe for the purpose, so it said, of laying a line to
Almaden. Nothing, however, has been done towards
manning the mines or building the line, or getting
authority to do it. Things were going to hum within six
months ; but.after waiting for about two years Etheridge
had added this to the long list of the good things that
haven’t come off.

“Nulla”: Re the discovery of gold slugs at the
new Dee (Rockhamjston, Q.) ru-h, there is the usual
local controversy as to the weight of the largest nuggets
found in the district. Back in J uly, 1869, a record was
established by young Cadden picking up a nugget at
Mount Wheeler weighing 2680 z. lldwt., Next day, and
only a few inches away, a lad named Luckman found
another scaling 1790 z, 14dwt. In September, 1870,

the most inland town of N.S.W.,
is quite a after a shower of rain. The surface
country is auriferous, and the washing away of the loose
earth leaves the gold exposed. All hands and the cook
turn out, looking for “colors” and nuggets. Day’s
pickings vary according to luck, from nothing to upwards
of 15s. The great drawback to earning a quiet living in
this easy-going fashion, is the infrequency of showers.

The Westralian Government, some months
ago, decided, on the advice of metallurgist Klug, not to
build furnaces at the Phillips River copper-field, as the
local miners asked, but to set up a sampling depfit, and
make advances against ore. Provis, late bf S. Australia,
has been in charge of the new idea since it was set going,
and about 1600 tons of ore have already been stacked.
The idea was to make liberal advances, so that the miners
could go on developing their shows; then, if develop-
ments were satisfactory, furnaces could be built, while,
if they were not satisfactory, a vessel could be chartered
to carry off the lot to eastern smelters. So far, no recom-
mendation has been made to the department one way or
the other.

Talk about the ups-and-downs of mining!
Collmann and Tacchi, once among the most brilliant of
Bendigo’s .producers, won last half-year, on its own
account, £4 worth of gold. But these Bendigo investors
do stick to their old shows. This mine has practically
returned nothing since 1899, yet all the time the share-
holders have kept briskly probing in all directions down
to nearly 2000 ft.

The drought in the Eastern States put just over
a million and a quarter into S. Australia’s calico bag.
(S. Australia usually carries its money in a small calico
bag with a tape run round the top of it.) This result is
arrived at by comparing the price actually realised for
the exported farm produce and what would have been
realised if it had got the average of the prices which pre-
vailed between 1895 and 1902. For its hay crop alone it
received £1,165,814, whereas on the other basis it
would have had only £585,400 —a 100 per cent, rise and a
few strawis • over. But, all the same, when, in order to
keep the finances straight, Treasurer Butler proposed
that the land-tax should be retained as it was last year,
the cry of the “poor farmer” was raised all over the
House, a farthing was knocked off the tax, and the
Treasurer was deliberately left with 1 an estimated deficit
of about £25,000.

An unexpected curse at Private Enterprise
and approval of the Socialistic policy of State Interfer-
ence from S.M. Herai.d’s “On the Land” article
.(2/11/’Q3).:--“The only export trade in perishable pro-
ducts that has been satisfactorily developed by this State
is that of the despised Australian rabbit. This is the only
line which has been sent solely under State supervision,
and is also the sole instance in which quality and get-up
have improved all the time, and the lead established by
another State, in the same product, effectually wiped
out. However, our commercial people seem to have
decided that such successes as these are unwarranted
interferences with those engaged in the trade—who volun-
tarily submit their rabbits for inspection and treatment,
and swear by the State system—and it is therefore only
reasonable that producers should look to private enter-
prise to show its superiority in enlarging the export of
produce-business.” ‘

Letter received from S’Africa by a leading Ade-
laide business man :—“ I promised to let you know the
position in Transvaal. Well, things are very unsatis-
factory. The Government, which, of course, is Crown
colony", is more corrupt than ever was the fiber Govern-
ment. I won’t go so far as to say Milner takes bribes,
but it is certain that a big proportion of his underlings
do, and Milner is (though brilliant) a very weak-charac-
tered man. He is entirely under the influence of the
German Jews by whom he is surrounded. These Jews
seem to think that Britain fought this war entirely for and
on their account. They have and are engineering the
depression in Jo’burg. They want Chinese labor, not
because Kajjirs- cannot be got, but to oust the white
employees, They are afraid these latter will combine to
oppose reduction of wages. The name of Australian is
execrated by the ‘magnates,’ because Australians are
the leaders of the opposition to Chinese. The position
in July/, was this re Kaffirs; before the war 96,000:
Kaffirs were employed, 33 per cent, of these were perma-
nently unfit for work through drink; efficient labor =
64,000 Kaffirs. In July 76,000 Kaffirs were at work, and if
these were concentrated on producing mines the former
output of "485,0000 z. per month could be got. But this
does not suit these greecy Jews ; they want the ‘com-
pound system’ as practised in Kimberley, so as to
get all the profits at present enjoyed by the
merchants of the town, regardless of the fact that
everyone else in the country will be ruined. This labor
bogey is a myth. It is certain that another 30,000 to
40,000 Kaffirs can be got at once. The talk of wanting
360,000 more ‘boys’ is nonsense. This number will
not be required for 10 years. The Deep Mines will
not be payable. The grade of ore undoubtedly falls
at depth. Forty million tons crushed on Rand since
start to (late. Average profit 10s. 7d. per ton. If grade
of ore (and it does) falls off ldwt., or 4s. 2d., and costs at
these great depths rise ldwt., or 4s. 2d., the profit will
only be 2s. 3d. per ton. The outlay to equip one of these
Deep mines On a 200-stamp basis is £BOO,OOO to £1,000,000,
and time- 4* to \7 years. Two hundred stamps crush
360,000 tons per annum. What possible hope of paying

‘ Vul.": Have it on the authority of a responsible eye-

“Ne’er-do-Weel"; I have read various pars, about the
fat man gloating over Susannah as exhibited by the
Mutoscope in Sydney; Here (Brisbane) the show is in a
short, straight passage opening on to the most crowded
side of our only street—Queen-street —without a door
or a curtain or anything to hide its nakedness. The
fat man can’t gloat over the charms of an ill-made
Susannah in the glare of all this publicity.- They must
manage these things much better in Sydney,
“ Only Me ’’: The poem, “ Our Brother," by Het Thule
(B. 22/10/’O3), reminds me of the chorus to a song written
by George Ade, in his musical comedy, “ The Sultan of
Sulu "
We want to assimilate, if we can,
Our brother who is brown ;
We love our dusky fellow-man,
And hate to hunt him down.
So, when we perforate his frame,
We want him to be good ;
We shoot at him to make him tame,
If he but understood.
This seems to me to fit our case exactly.
“T.D.” : To anyone with a knowledge of the people
who appeared in the recent “ society vaudeville ’’ show
at Melbourne Princess’s the daily paper notices were ex-
cruciatingly funny. One ingenuous critic plastered
his half-column with references to “ Society's ornaments,"
“ ladies whose dancing has hitherto been confined to the
ball-room," and his own overwhelming surprise at the
hoof dexterity of young ladies of the “ vice-regal visiting
list.” Purves and Boffard were really about the only
people in the show who had even a nodding acquaint-
ance with the average V.R. aide-de-camp.
George Vining took the London Princess’s with a
capital of only £5O, and immediately struck oil with
Boucicault’s “ Streets of London.” A bigger success
followed, with “ Arrah-na-Pogue.” The splendid mechani-
cal business of the last scene was suggested by there
being under the stage an apparatus made at a cost of
£6OO for one of the previous management’s failures.
After “Arrah-na-Pogue” came another big hit with
“ Never Too Late to Mend." Vining made a fortune,
and lost it all in his next production, “Acis and
Galatea.” He died poor as a rat.
Granville Bantock, who came out to Australia as
orchestra conductor of “ The Gaiety Girl ’’ co., has lately
been trying his strength at serious work in London. He
produced “ an orchestral interlude from the unperformed
oratorio of ‘ Christus,’ ” but Bantock’s attempt to give a
musical representation of “ the region of desolation into
which Christ retired to prepare himself for the ministry
on earth ”is said to be unsatisfactory. He attempted too
much. A Bantockian tone picture of Jonah in the un-
furnished apartments of the Whale might have been
more successful.
State Labor leader M'Gowen has given his
idea about the Federal capital: It ought to have
an area of 1000 sq. miles, but the Federation
ought to buy, 900 sq. miles of it. He “ would
oppose in every possible way the proposal that
N.S.W. should give up such a large area of valu-
able territory as 1000 sq. miles whilst no contri-
bution was made by the other partners.” But the
other States did make a contribution —they under-
took not to make any claim on the Federal capital.
And even if this wasn’t contribution enough, it is
four years too late now to talk about it. N.S.W.
trusted George Reid to make a bargain for it; it
ratified that bargain; and there’s the end of it.
If it doesn’t think now that it was a good bargain,
all it can do is not to trust George Reid to make
any more. N.S. Wales can’t afford to be a fraud
because its ambassador was a fool.
“Scotty the Wrinkler” (Phil Moubray)
died in Narandera Hospital, last Monday, after
an operation for cystitis. Moubray was one
of the most curious personalities of the Aus-
tralian back-country. Coming of a well-known
Scotch family, he was for some years a British
artillery officer, and saw service in India.
Then, somehow, he drifted out to Aus-
and lived as a “ whaler ” —camping oh
the river bends of the back country, existing
on what he could fish and hunt—eked out
with a little money earned by literary work.
Moubray was a man who had been well educated,
and took no pains to conceal the fact. His great
store of back country experiences made his para-
graph contributions to The Bulletin of great
interest. For all his dogmatic opimonativeness,
“ Scotty” was a kindly soul, and there are many
who will sorrow at his end.

It can be claimed fpr Dr. Ross that he enters
more thoroughly into the current spirit of
N.S.W. Parliament than any other member.
For gorgeous folly, what could surpass these ques-
tions tabled the other day ? : >
(1) Will the Minister for Instruction obtain from the
Government Astronomer a report giving the following
information : (a) whether the season is likely to be wet
or dry, favorable or-, unfavorable, for the-, approaching
harvest, judging by late and present meteorological per-
turbations ; (b) when viewed in relation to the unfavor-
able weather season and disastrous harvest that have
recently occurred in many agricultural districts in. the
Northern Hemisphere ?
(2) Can he furnish any physical or known or recognised
scientific meteorological data or principle upon which
weatherioreCasts are framed or foretold, and upon what
recognised scientific basis or principle each conclusion
and forecast of the approaching weather is arrived at ?
(3) Will he obtain information as to how climatic
changes and erratic perturbations of the seasons are
brought about, for the information of the general public,
and by way of demonstrating the advancement made in
the realms of alleged scientific weather forecasts,
ibeteorology, and modern scientific research in the
twentieth'.pentury ?
Dit. Ross tffill yet, in the artless pursuit of know-
ledge. table some such questions as these:—
How many tail feathers has Elijah Dowie in his left
wing? And why? What principles of pterylography
govern the matter? Will the Premier see that the
practice is stopped, and also find out why matches don’t
grow on icebergs ?
In view of the extreme improbability of malarial fever
ever afflicting New South Wales will he give instructions
for the inoculation of all mosquitoes against malaria ?
And, after all, the House may as well gambol with
Db. Ross as transact any of the other matters it
oalls business.

An Important Decision
By the Liverpool “ Mercury.” The Use of Electricity in Medicine.
That famous British authority, the Liverpool “Mercury,” in a recent scientific
article, speaks out plainly in favor of the uses of Electricity as an aid to medical
treatment. We give here a few extracts
“The discovery by Rontgen of the power peculiar to the rays which emanate from the Crook’s tube has given a further impulse to the use of
Electricity in Medicine . . . The rays produce marked effects upon the tissues themselves."
Here in a few words is explained the wonderful curative action of the electric
rays which emanate from the cells of
THE FREEMAN & WALLACE ELECTRIC “ INVIGORATOR ” BELT
which is sold for ONE POUND ONLY, and which penetrate into the weak parts
injured by disease and re-vitalizes every nerve and tissue of the body. Every spark
is a wave of animal life sweeping: into the system. Its curative current is the
essence of vitality, which makes men strong:. It has no equal, being: hig:hly cer-
tificated. Do not wear an Electric Belt unless ordered to do so by a competent
physician. Electricity sometimes aggravates a disease beyond all hope of cure.
Facts to Remember.
«
Do not buy an electric belt
from belt vendors who are
unregistered men. Ask to
see the name of the doctor
in the “ Registered Medical
Practitioners’ List for New

belts are sold in Australia
by men who do not know
even the first principles of
Electricity.

The feelings of a N.S.W. South Coast
tow*' received a rude shock when people
read in a local rag under the heading “Cable-
grams :—“The Duke of York states that
the sceptre is the happy slave of the glass jug.”
People even began to think of Edward VII., with
his crown on, fetching the beer home to the Tower
of London for dinner. But it proved to be “The
Duke of York Stakes—Sceptre first, Happy Slave
second, and Glass Jug third. Thus Edward VII.
left the court without a stain on his character.
Boyd, M.L.A., of Victoria, just returned
from a visit to S.A., says he found two of Vio-
tom s lost railway carriages in use on the lines
there. The vanished rolling-stock of Victoria has
been a screaming joke for some years; last stock-
taking showed that dozens of carriages and trucks
and various engines had dropped through a crack
somewhere and disappeared. So now Shiels will,
presumably, stand on the border line and wail
bitterly to Jenkins, “ Gimme back me trains ! ”
“Barney ” tells a possible truth :
A man, breathing heavily of beer, and chewing a ham
sandwich, flopped on the seat next to me on a suburban
train, the other night. He hadn’t got through with the
sandwich before he dropped into a heavy sleep, a piece of
crust hanging, pipe fashion, from his mouth. The train
arrived at the next station with a bit of a jerk, which
woke him up. He blinked owlishly at the lamp in the
carriage, carefully felt in all his pockets for matches, and
tned.three times to light the crust. Then he discovered

“ D.”: Re our national propensity for prop-
ping ourselves up with anything that comes handy.
Went after a job once. There were about 68
applicants, and, pending the arrival of the boss,
we propped ourselves up with a newly white-
washed wall. When the boss was examining our
credentials he asked each one to turn round while
he hunted for traces of whitewash on him. The
man who got the job didn’t lean against the wall.
He had evidently been leaning against a bag of
bonedust before he arrived, and he smelt so badly
that the fellows who were leaning against the
wall had made him go away and lean against a
lamp-post all by himself. That was what got him
the billet. The boss was evidently blind in his
nose.
One of the reforms for which old Hori
Grey fought for years seems likely to be adopted
very soon in Maoriland. The great democrat
never could understand why one-man-one-vote
wasn’t as good and proper a thing for country
local governing bodies as for Parliament and for
city municipalities. Over 20 years ago he tried to
get a change made; but there were then only a
few with him. In 1886 he called for division after
division while the Consolidating Counties Bill was
before the House, but the majority against him
was overwhelming. In 1899 the numbers were
about equal; and now, in the Government’s
Local Government Franchise Bill, the principle
has been adopted, and, if it passes, as it seems
likely to do, one-man-one-vote will be practically
the law in all M.L. public institutions where the
still broader one-adult-one-vote does not prevail.
They do things thoroughly in the Chinese
ports. Shanghai Times, of July 18, describes the
oapture of a band of thieves, whose offence was
“hat-snatching.” The police seem to have been
unable to detect these desperate ruffians for some
time, so when they were caught it was dealt out
to three of them thus: 500 blows each, followed
by a month in the cangue (kind of pillory, fitting
on the neck, and portable—the wearer carries his
pillory about with him); then imprisonment vary-
ing from six months to a year, and banishment to
end up. There is no encouragement to be a mem-
ber of the Push in China.
“F.C.” on the parson’s son :
Met a friend of mine, a country baker, lately, in the
last stages of explosion. Hadn’t seen him for three
months, and then he was lamenting the loss of his “ boy ”
who used to do his most profitable round. The youth
had departed without the usual formalities, incidentally
taking the monthly payments with him. I enquired as
to the missing one. “Never heard any more of him.”
“Go round yourself now, I suppose, or do you trust the
new man?” “Don’t ask me! Don’t mention it 1 Look
here, you know I can’t do three rounds and bake
myself—l must have someone. Well, I got old
’s son to take that young ruffian’s place. It
was a bit of a come - down for him a parson’s
son—but I didn’t reckon to have to watch him. He
ante’d up all right for two pays, but last month, blow me
(five minutes here for insulting language)—blow me, if he
didn’t clear out with the takings too, and he took the
.name boards off the cart, and sold the whole turn-out,
horse and all, for £25. I got that back, but it cost me a
tenner ; as for him (ten minutes here for
further and stronger language). Say, do you happen to
know a hard-faced reprobate, of disreputable parentage,
who will come back with, say, half the cash and the
turn-out ? ”


A fine cave has been discovered on the
Margaret River (W.A.), about a mile from the
Lake cave. A skeleton of a man thinly encrusted
with lime and in a good state of preservation was
found in it, as well as a quantity of casual bones.
It is thought that the skeleton is what is left of
one of the crew of a Dutch vessel lost on the coast
in the dark ages. Captain Fremantle was search-
ing for survivors of this vessel when he discovered
the mouth of the Swan River, where Fremantle
now stands. A good many lost Dutchmen left
their bones about the western and northern coast.
A Ceylon tea-planter named Jordan, who
is now in Australia trying to “encourage more
friendly relations ” between his small Bull-owned
island and this continent, lets some light into the
preferential-trade project. In 1900 alone Ceylon
received 208,000 Tamils from India. Says the tea-
planter :
As laborers they are splendid. They turn out at six in
the morning, men, women, and children, and work till
four. . . . The wages are about 6d. a day, and the women
and children get less. Out of this they pay for food and
wardrobe which, however, is usually something less than
a handkerchief. They live very cheaply. Sixpence a day
is not much, but on' the mainland they probably would
not get more than from Id. to lid.

Captain Arthur Paul, long known in Vic-
toria as one of Lansell’s mine-managers and
advisers, died at Melbourne lately. Paul was in
charge of the 220 mine at Bendigo when the
deep-sinker took it over, and so got into the
latter’s service. Probably the biggest mistake he
ever made was when he and the millionaire went
over the Broken Hill mines together in their earliest
days, and decided that the prospects were not
good enough to warrant the poor little prices then
current. Lansell was full of the idea that there
ought to be other lodes just as good in the district;
he didn’t know one field in Victoria which had
one good line of reef and no more. They, there-
fore, took up “ promising country ” around Mount
Robe, and dropped what money they put into it.
Years after Paul managed the North Broken Hill
mine, and at the height of the lead boom earned
profits from it; but when that boom collapsed he
went out of the mine-managing business.

AN AUTHORITY SAYS.

PEOPLE cannot understand why Diamonds do not come down in price.
Unless some new Diamond fields are discovered they will never come
down, and I think that proportionately they will go as much higher
in the next ten years as they have in the last ten years. The reason
is this: Ten years ago it took less than one-third of the effort to produce
Diamonds as it does to-day. In other words, the strata of blue ground in the
Kimberley Fields that were then worked were so prolific that Diamonds
were found practically on the top of the earth. After the very prolific strata
were worked out and it was necessary to go down a little deeper into the
earth Diamonds were not quite so plentiful, and to-day it takes at least three
times the effort to produce the same amount of stones it did ten years ago.
Pearls are also going up in value at a rapid rate.
A
UNIQUE
INVESTMENT.

AS an investment, Diamonds afford advantages offered by nothing else.
For years they have increased in value at about the rate of 10 per
■■ cent, a year, which makes them as an investment about three times as
good as any bank. When you put your money in the bank someone
else has the use of it; when you put it in Diamonds you yourself have the use
of it, and the pleasure and satisfaction of wearing Diamonds are worth as
much as the returns from the investment. This is no idle statement, written
only with the view of selling our Diamond goods, but actual facts which you
can easily prove to be correct.
_ We are the only Australian firm having a Warehouse in Hatton Garden,
which place, as everyone knows, is the Diamond Mart of the world. Our
long and careful study of the Stone Market has placed us in the unique posi-
tion of being able to buy more favorably than almost any firm. These
advantages are shared with our customers, while others, if they could buy as
cheaply, would probably retain them as extra profit.

Thoso who have taken this medicine are amazed at its wonderful influence. Sufferers from any form of Bronchitis, Cough, Difficulty of Breathing, Hoarseness, Pain or
Soreness in the Chest, experience delightful and immediate relief; and to those who are subject to Colds on the Chest it is invaluable, as it effects a Complete Cure. It is most com-
forting in allaying irritation in the throat and giving strength to the voice, and it neither allows a Cough or Asthma to become chronic, nor Consumption to develop. Consumption has
never been known to exist where “ Coughß " have been properly treated with this medicine. No house should be without it, as, taken at the beginning, a dose is generally sufficient,
and a Complete Cure is certain,

Mr. W. G. Hearn*.—Otar Sir,—l am writing' to tell you
about the wonderful our# your medicine has effected in
my case. About three years ago I began to cough. At
llrst the cough was not severe, but it gradually got worse,
and I became very weak and troubled with night sweats,
pain in my chest, and great quantities of phlegm. On
several occasions there was blood in the expectorated
matter. I had been treated by a doctor, who pronounced
my case to be Consumption, and various other treatments
had been tried, but without benefit. It was at this stage
that I heard of your Bronchitis Cure, and sent to you for
a course of the medicine. When it arrived I was too ill to
leave my bed, but I commenced taking it at once, and
gradually improved. lam glad to say that the two lots
of medicine you sent have effected a complete cure, for
which accept my very best thanks.—Yours gratefully,

lam sure you will be glad to know that your Bronchitis
Cure has quite cured me. I was very glad when it came,
as I wag suffering from a severe attack of Bronchitis at the
time it arrived. I had sent for my own doctor, but had
not had one night’s rest for a week. I started taking the
Bronchitis Cure three times a day as directed, and was
very much eased at once. At the end of a week I only
took it twice a day, and then only every night for a
week, as I was so much better when, thanks to the Lord
for adding His blessing, I was quite well, and walked into
town and back without feeling any fatigue. I had not
done that previously for 12 months—always went in the
omnibus—as walking caused me such pain and distress in
the chest. I always walk now, and never feel it, and I
am stronger than I have been for years. I thank my son
for his great kindness pi sending the medicine, and am,
dear Sir,

SPITTING UP BLOOD.
THE DOCTOR SAID NOTHING MORE COULD BE
DONE.
CURED BY HEARNE'S BRONCHITIS CURE.
The extract runs as follows: —“ As for myself, thank
the Lord, lam feeling stronger than I have for years. I
had an attack of Bronchitis in November, but Hearne’s
Bronchitis Cure was again successful. I feel quite well,
and walk into town feeling quite strong.
“ I must ask you to send me six bottles more of the
medicine, as I wish to have a supply in the house. I
have tried to get it made up here, and let my chemist
have a bottle to see what he could do. He tells me this
week he can make nothing out of it, he never saw any-
thing like it before, so there is only one thing for me to
do —send for more. I have never kept in bed one day
since I commenced to take it. I used to be in bed a fort-
night at a time always, and after that for months I was
as weak as I could possibly be, and was always taking
cod liver oil, so you will see at once it is quite worth
while sending for it such a long distance.
“ Something more I must tell you. Charlotte has been
very ill since I wrote you. Her cough was so bad she
never had a night’s rest, and was spitting up blood
very much. The doctor told her husband that there was
nothing more he could do for her. So on the Sunday I
sent her half a bottle of the Bronchitis Cure, and told
her to try it, and if she did not use it, not to waste it,
but send it back again. She had such confidence in her
doctor that I thought she would not try it. On the
Wednesday I sent over again, and she was much better,
the night’s rest was very good, and cough and bleeding
from the lungs better. She sent for another half-bottle,
and on the following Sunday sent over to say that she
was quite cured and did not require any more medicine.
So you see what great good it has done, and she wishes
to have some of my next supply.”

COMPLETELY CURED.
“ Mr. W. G. Hearne.
“ Dear Sir, —Your medicine has cured me of bronchitis
and asthma, from which I suffered for upwards of seven
years, during which period I was scarcely ever free from
coughs, and frequently the difficulty of breathing was so
distressing that for nights in succession I had to sit up.
I write you this acknowledgment from a sense of duty, as
in my case every other treatment had failed. For a year
previous I had been getting very much worse, and at the
time I obtained your medicine I was confined to bed
suffering from a most violent cough, expectorating blood
and matter, and apparently beyond hope of recovery.
The first dose of the medicine gave me welcome relief,
and I steadily improved as I continued the treatment,
until I became, as I am now, quite well.—Yours sincerely,

17 years, and having been under a great many different
treatments without benefit, I was induced to try Hearne's
medicine for Asthma. After taking three bottles of this
medicine I quite got rid of the Asthma, and since then,
which was in the beginning of 1883 — 15 years ago—l have
not had the slightest return of it. The medicine quite
cured me, and I have much pleasure in recommending it.”
Writing again on the 4th April, 1899, he states: —“I
am keeping very well now. Never have the slightest
return of the Asthma."

NATURE S GREAT BLOOD PURIFIER.
Constipation, Indigestion, and Liver Troubles Removed.
The “Medical Journal, November, 1902, says
concerning KUTNOW’S POWDER:
44 Disorders of the liver —whether arising from excessive or deficient secretion of
bile, with such well-known characteristic symptoms as headache, nausea, pain in the
abdomen, diarrhoea, and low spirits, or with the important symptoms of dyspepsia such
as constipation, a feeling of abnormal fulness or emptiness, heartburn, an offensive
taste, foul breath, a furred tongue, flatulence, irregular heart action, an emaciated
countenance, drowsiness, and languor—these are now most successfully treated by
Kutnow’s Powder. This preparation is a natural antiseptic aperient, it acts as a
solvent, loosening all hard faecal matter which may have accumulated, and eliminating
the same without any suggestion of griping or pain. Amongst the many eminent
specialists who have commended Kutnow’s Powder in the highest terms we note the
names of Sir Andrew Clark, M.D., Sir Morell Mackenzie, M.D., and Professor Lawson
Tait, M.D. We may add that Kutnow’s Powder, although containing no sugar, is
pleasant to the taste, decidedly refreshing, and is well sustained by the most delicate
stomach. It produces an immediate sense of relief, or to put it in the words of a patient,
4 lt seems to at once take away a load of trouble.’”
Kutnow’s Powder can be obtained from all Chemists and Medicine
Vendors throughout the World.
A WARNING TO THE PUBLIC!
There are some unscrupulous chemists who, knowing Kutnow’s Powder to possess sucli rare medicinal,
curative, and healing properties as have secured for it a world-wide popularity and a phenomenal sale, do not
hesitate to palm off closely imitated substitutes, got up to appear to the eye as nearly as possible like the genuine
article. These substitutes, however, generally oilered as something “cheaper” and “just as good,” are absolutely
injurious to health, and therefore dear at any price. If you value your health, then accept only the
GENUINE KUTNOW’S POWDER.

The Lonely Tomb.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The blue Spring sky was overhead,
The south wind whispered to the trees.
I sought a story for a song ;
My heart was full of melodies.
And so I wandered slowly on,
Till, on a hill-top bleak, I found
An aged man, of aspect stern,
Who sat upon a lonely mound.
“My oath,” he gruffly said, “ you’re right! ”
You ain’t the first that’s called him brave.
He lost his life to save ’is mate’s ;
An’ this is where we dug ’is grave.”
Then seized I on that ancient man,
And said : “ Upon yon simple stone
We’ll carve a golden epitaph ! ”
He said : “ You leave the thing alone !
“It ain’t your tomb t’ fuss around.
Read what he’s got—just R.I.P. ;
He don’t want more, I know, because
He told me ’fore he died, yer see.
“Says he : * I’ve been a quiet cove,
And never cared for fuss or show ;
Just put a simple tombstone up—
T’ let ’em see I’m there, y’ know.
“ ‘ I only want ter R.I.P.’,
He sighed, and gives an orful corf—
‘And, if yer don’t mind, Bill, old boy,
Just keep th’ goats and poets off.’ ”
I glared awhile at that old man
Ere down the hill I madly flung ;
Forgotten were those melodies -
I left that noble song unsung.

The Camel’s Back.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
We tried to turn over a new leaf, but found it too
heavy. It fell back, and did some moral damage
perhaps. The boss —who had the contract to
supply the Silverstream saw-mill with logs—
sacked us after three days’ trial. He would
have sacked us sooner, only he hadn’t the moral
courage. He was a little boss, too, with a sandy
complexion. Little men inclined to be ginger
generally have moral courage. He said he
wouldn’t want us any more. That didn’t hurt us
much—Jack and I were used to getting the sack,
and to people who didn’t want us. He said we
weren’t bushmen. We got over that—we weren’t
bushmen, and consequently we didn’t have the
bushman’s pride or ambition. Did you ever fell
trees in rough country, and cut them into logs
with a cross-cut saw, and “pack” them out of a
gully over stumps and rocks, when you had never
done any graft before ? That’s what we did. We
worked hard for the first two days, and got three
logs. Then we took things easy, and waited for
the sack, even as a Chinaman waits for death.
It was a sort of sinful relief to find ourselves on
the track again. We were professional wanderers.
We had no money—not even enough to pay our
fares in by the train, 18 miles. We had a dirty
Eiece of paper to the owner of the mill requesting
lm to pay me 7s. 6d. and Jack 12s. The want of
money didn’t worry us so much —we were used to
it. But we hadn’t any tobacco. That’s what
hurt us.
We had tramped 13 miles since dinner-time
without a drink —exoept water; there’s plenty of
that in Maoriland. I wanted two long beers, and
so did Jack. But we wanted a smoke worse. I
think we met more men on that road who didn’t
smoke, or had just cut up their last pipeful, or
who wanted to borrow a pipeful themselves, than
we had met on any track during the whole course
of our vagabond career.
We had still five miles to go. It is seven miles
from Petone to Wellington. There seemed to be
about a thousand points. Every now and then
Jack would say, “ The pub. must be round the
next bluff.” But it wasn’t, nor the next, nor the
next, nor the one after that. Jack’s language had
been getting gradually less fit for publication
from the time we left Petone. He oursed the
sawmill and the world, and the day he learned to
smoke, and he prophesied against each succeeding
bluff in language which wasn't even fit to be
written down on a piece of paper and handed up
to the magistrate. But now he was too tired to
curse. We gave up hoping and speculating at
last, and just tramped on doggedly. It was hours
after dark. We saw the lights of Wellington
across the curve of the bay all the time, but they
never seemed to get any nearer. They just
seemed to stay off, and keep as far away as the
stars. But we looked to see if we had our orders
to the mill-owner safe, and hoped on.
We were dirty and ragged, and hadn't had a
shave or a bath for a week. We were unspeak-
ably tired and thirsty. There were eight of us in
reality ; there was the man I was, and the ghost
of the man I might have been, and the spook of
the (youth I had been, and the spectre of the
wreck I yet might be. Ditto with Jack, I think,
for he walked on with his head bowed and thought
—just thought. You are seldom too tired to
think.
Round the foot of a big, dark bluff there swept
a merry party of ladies and gentlemen on horse-
back, cantering out from Wellington along the
hard, white, star-lit road. They were part of a
variety company, I believe. One of the girls
turned in her saddle as her horse half-shied, and
exclaimed:
“ Oh, two old swaggies—he-he-he !”
And the others said : “Ha-ha! Ho-ho ! ” and
“ He-he ! ”
It was the last straw. I fully expected Jack
to straighten himself up in his scornful wrath and
turn round and prophesy against them, but he
didn’t. His face bowed a little lower, just a little
lower, and he folded his arms tight and high up
on his chest and plodded on. He didn’t say any-
thing. I felt that the iron had entered into his
soul.
We slept out that night, and next morning the
owner of the sawmill refused to cash our orders.
We never got the money.
I gave the new leaf another trial and succeeded.
I’in reformed. I back horses on commission now.
That's respectable enough—for Australia !
HENRY LAWSON.
A Summer Night in Bourke.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The sky is bright and clear; its color only
matched by the little bluebell which peeps from
amongst the saltbush on the plain. The seemingly
boundless expanse is covered with a stunted
growth of mulga and lignum. Across it the heat
haze shivers. The atmosphere is still and stifling;
there is no breath of air. By-and-by a dull yellow
cloud gathers in the west. Slowly it creeps
towards us, then the choking dust-storm is upon
us like a whirlwind of devils. The sun sets—a
sickly yellow orb whose fierce glare is tempered by
this curtain of dust.
Just at sundown with a sounding thump I throw
my swag against the wall of the “Oxford,” and,
having relieved myself of the billy, I walk into
the bar and call for a drink. “ Have one yourself,
Billy?” I casually remark to the landlord, for
that is the way of Bourke. The air is full
of dust—it fills every cranny and settles upon the
furniture. In consequence the place is illumi-
nated. The smoking kerosene lamps flicker in the
midst of a yellow halo, and add their pestilence to
the general oppressiveness. The temperature at
six had been 110°.
We sit at the table 20 minutes after the bullock-
bell. All our coats are off and our sleeves rolled
up. It is too hot to eat, but we are very thirsty.
We pick over our food and curse the Chinaman.
Why the devil does he make the tucker so
infernally greasy ? One by one we walk out under
the verandah.
At the invitation of the publioan we play four-
handed “crib.” “Fifteen two, fifteen four ;
mine’s a pint; why the devil didn’t you chuck
out the ace”—this, together with the inevitable
post-mortem on every deal, is heard with variations
until midnight. We then lounge around gasping
for breath and yarning until the beds begin to
cool down a bit—about 2 a.m. At 3 I am out
again staggering along the passage to the water-
bag, for after many drinks my tongue is dry and
my mouth parched.
“Bring us back a drink,” ray room mate says in
a tired voice. The poor devil is too weary to get
out of bed. There is a big drought on, for another
fellow has the water-bag to his mouth, and it is
nearly empty.
When I go back to the room the other fellow
stretches out his hand in the darkness and gropes
for the glass. We had pulled down the blinds,
for in a darkened room we had a better chance of
sleeping. He clutches and drinks. “ Thanks ! ”
Witli a sigh he limply turns again with his face to
the wall.
This performance is repeated half-hourly until
about 4.30. Then the sun rises, glaring over the
horizon. I am more listless now than when I
retired.
I gaze across the yard. Half-a-dozen miserable
wretches lie there, fully dressed, vainly endeavor-
ing to snatch a few minutes’ sleep. The
atmosphere of a room would stifle them. They
continually shift their blankets from place to
place, knowing full well that there is not one spot
less trying than,another. As if there could be a
cool corner in Hell ! 1
With the first peep of dawn the heat-waves
again begin to quiver, and all hands make for the
bar. A parched wretch has been knocking at the 1
publican’s door for the last half-hour. I had
noticed him going to bed with a bottle of beer in
each hand. “For God’s sake, Mr. Publichouse,”
he implores, “give us a drink.” The publican, in
stentorian tones, has meanwhile been endeavoring
to curse him off the premises. “If you don’t
come out soon we’ll go down to Paddy’s,” threatens
the thirsty one. This fetches him, and the owner
of the stentorian voice emerges in bare feet,
growling horribly. He carries the key of the bar
in one hand, and holds up his trousers with the
other.
The boarders had by this time lined up in their
pyjamas—bank clerks and sundries, with white
faces, each with a tremendous thirst and sleepless
eyes. The workers drink pints, and the johnnies
whisky and soda. We repeat the dose several
times before breakfast.
They wander aimlessly into the dining-room
somewhere about nine. Most of them enter the
room with a wild glare and quickly discover the
olive bottle. They grab it, and with unsteady
hands dive into it with a fork. The man who had
retired to rest accompanied by the two bottles of
beer now lurches in, with a fishy look in his eye.
Without any undue or undignified hurry he seizes
his porridge spoon, and with shaky fingers pours
out a dose of Worcestershire sauce. With the air
of a man who makes a virtue of necessity, he
drinks it and takes his place at the table. Con-
versation fails, for all hands feel pretty seedy.
I think of ice-cold water dripping into crystal
pools ; of fern-clad gullies; green fields and snow-
capped mountains. But when I look up, I see
through the shimmering air naught but the
dazzling roofs of the houses and the dusty glaring
roads.

“ Ne’er-do-Weel ” about a large and
generally disliked fish :
“Mailer” (8., 17/9/’O3) says hungry sharks draw no
rigid “ color line.” Well, in the matter of broken bottles
or iron they may not, hut in regard to flesh they do
I have seen blacks and browns diving for coins in shark-
infested waters all over the world, and I never saw either
humans or sharks put themselves out the least little bit
in the world. On a voyage to the West Indies, Colon, and
the S. American ports, some years ago, we lay for a
couple of days at Port-au-Prince, Hayti. The whole time
we were there a huge shark lay motionless under the
stern of the vessel, and treated all our attempts to catch
him with contempt. The harbor was literally swarming
with sharks, but the black boys were diving for coins as
though such a fish had never been heard of in Haytian
waters. The crack diver was a fine, well-set-up buck
about 30 years of age, with a dazzling grin. He'
offered to dive from his boat, which was on the port side,
under the ship, for a florin if it was dropped into the sea,
from (he starboard side. The coin was dropped and a
signal given to him at the same time and he dived under
the ship and secured the money. Then, to our horror,
he proceeded to swim leisurely back to his boat round the
stern of the vessel. We shouted to him but he only
grinned a more dazzling grin than usual and continued
on his way. When a few yards from where the shark lay
he dived right under it, came to the surface again,
grinned another dazzle and swam to his boat. Though
the nigger appeared to go close under the shark the latter
never betrayed the slightest knowledge of his proximity 1 ,
did not even swish its tail—cut the colored gent dead, in
fact. Kingston Harbor (Jamaica) tco, is alive with
sharks, especially when the turtle ships come in, but the
. blacks never seem to stop bathing on account of them.
But I saw a yellow fellow slip into The Race round Port
( Royal Point. He was whirled 100yds. away in a flash and
I the sharks had him before we could get to him. He was
fa very white “ colored pusson,” and the white man’s fate
' befeli him.

For Fifteen Years
“ TT T is with pleasure that I write you re the
medicinal virtues of Bile Beans,” says Mr.
A. W. Lee, of Yictoria-road, Marrickville,
Sydney. “For about fifteen years I
have been a sufferer from biliousness. In
that period I have tried all the patent
medicines of any note, and occasionally I would
derive a little benefit from them, but not lasting
any time, and it would return just as bad as ever.
When I had any bad attack my complexion
would be as yellow as saffron, and it was hard to
get along with my work. I consulted doctors,
but, strange to say, I could not get any satisfac-
tion ; and the reason I gave Bile Beans a trial was
in this way : I went to the doctor and he gave
me a prescription, which I took to the chemist ;
and it was the pills that I got. I had
seen Bile Beans before, and the ones I got
in return for the prescription were for all the
world like Bile Beans. Since that time I have
always kept Bile Beans in the house. I am
healthy and strong now, and this I put down to
Bile Beans; and I always recommend them when
I come across anyone complaining of not feeling
well. I say, ‘ Give Bile Beans a trial, and you
won’t regret it.’ ”

The Last Drink.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The Earth was like a wizened pear,
Her breasts were cold and dry ;
The dying sun, with bloodshot glare,
Rose trembling in the sky.
The sky was hung with scarlet clouds ;
It was the last dread dawn—
The Resurrected, in their shrouds,
Walked on and on and on.
It was a sight to shudder at—
The day was Judgment Day—
The white road to Jehoshaphat
Stretched leagues and leagues away.
Silent as tombs were church and mart,
The pale sea moaned afar—
But Doolan of the Dauntless Heart
Stood fast behind his bar.
He smiled a smile of gruesome mirth,
That red-haired Irishman ;
He was upon the blighted Earth
The Last Lone Publican.
No traveller with him could stay
To dine at ease, or sup ;
His pub. in grim facetious way
He called “ The Stirrup Cup.'*
But I knew Doolan and we dined—
We would in Hades thrive ;
Of all the myriads of mankind
We were the last alive.
And half with glee, and half with awe,
I sat with pipe and glass
In Doolan’s “Stirrup Cup” and saw
The weird procession pass.
A Publisher I knew went by
With whom I used to war,
And passed with terror in his eye
A pious Editor.
“ Come in,” cried Doolan, “ come and wet;
Come in and drink,” cried he.
“ It is the last drink you will get
For all Eternity.”
But dolefully they passed in packs,
With pants, and groans, and sighs,
And obelisks upon their backs
And tons of tombstone lies.
Then Doolan put his shutters up,
His sign took from the door.
And so we left “ The Stirrup Cup,”
And never saw it more.

The King and the Pope.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
We came down to Leghorn at dusk, having seen
the King of England acknowledge the welcome of
the English colony in the Maremma, and some
American friends at Leghorn told us of the sudden
and unnoticed visit of the Queen of Portugal, and
of her haste to escape from such a frigid climate.
“She wasn’t a queen at all,” piped the smallest
American —eight years old. “ She might have
worn her week day crown.”
“Quite a dowdy,” said the lady opposite me.
“Nice, pleasant, stout face enough; but fearful
clothes, worn anyhow, and a gem hat.”
So much for personal appearances—it was the
other appearances that drove the lady away.
Queen Amelia aocompanied King Edward from
Portugal to Naples, and there had all the honors
due to a visiting sovereign, and it was thought
that she would accompany the King of England
to Rome. But the royal house of Portugal is
devoutly Catholic, and the visit of Queen Amelia
to Rome would, of course, necessitate the recogni-
tion of the King of Italy, whom the Pope, still
trying to keep up the farce of temporal power,
insists oh styling the “King of Sardinia.” And
such a stultification of the Pope might mean an
extension of the excommunication said to be kept
in force against the reigning house of Italy, to
Queen Amelia and the Portuguese King. So at the
last; moment Queen Amelia parted from the King
of England and sailed to Leghorn in her yacht.
But the telegraph was quicker.
There were three vessels of the Italian navy-
two torpedo boats and a destroyer—and as soon
as it was known that the Queen of Portugal had
been so afraid of the Pope as not to venture the
appearance of slighting him, those two torpedo
boats and the destroyer were rushed out of harbor
and sent to cruise purposelessly in the Mediter-
ranean. The port officials and the Mayor and
other shore authorities were ordered out of town
also j and when Queen Amelia arrived there was
no welcome given and no notice taken, although
the Queen of Portugal is related to the King of
Italy through the marriage of her sister to the
Duke of Aosta. Queen Amelia’s sister met her
at Leghorn, and the Portuguese yacht stayed
a few hours and then put to sea again. The
authorities are doubly sorry for the necessity of
the step, because while the Portuguese yacht
was in harbor a French warship—the first for a
century—entered the port, and there was nobody
to bid it welcome.
The Pope’s attempt to keep up the farcical idea
that he is Lord Of Rome is all the more ridiculous
when the attitude of the people to the church is
considered. The Bishop of Leghorn a year ago
spoke publicly of “ The Pope-King,” and until a
few months ago had to be guarded by carabinieri;
and I myself saw, in the Cathedral square of
Leghorn, in the Easter of 1902, a procession of
cardinals, dignitaries of the church, and priests,
guarded by soldiers with their carbines at the
ready. And in this polite land it is bad form to
bow .to a priest and shameful to have one for a
friend. In Calabria and Sicily the worst insult is
“ soldier of the Pope.”
To us in Australia who know the Australian
priest this may appear cruel and unjust ; but the
priests in Australia are mostly well-educated
gentlemen, and the priest in Italy is too often the
most ignorant and dirty son of the most ignorant
peasant.
Having seen how Queen Amelia’s insult to the
Italian people was requited, it came as a surprise
to the English colony in Tuscany and to most
Italians that the King of England had visited the
Pope. It has been explained by the newspapers
—and there are apparently very few Italian news-
papers unfriendly to Britain—that the visit to the
Pope was necessary owing to the fact that King
Edward is shortly to visit Ireland, and all the
journals speak appreciatively of the tact shown
by the King in making his visit as much the visit
of a private citizen as possible. The Pope as
tactfully seconded Edward Vll.’s endeavors to
steer a middle course—and the efforts of Cardinal
Rampolla to insist on the interview being as
between reigning sovereigns were doomed to
failure.
That the Italians should bitterly oppose any pos-
sibility of a return to theocratic rule is easily
understandable to any man with a fair knowledge
of Italian life. Italy is only 40 years old and has
made wonderful progress. Wealth has increased
—but to the few only ; to the many, the facilities
for education have increased, and consequently
the standard of education has been raised. But
the heavy taxation falls on the poor in a monstrous
incidence, and, although wealth has increased,
wages generally remain at starvation point. A
wealthy man keeping horses for amusement has
no horse-tax to pay; the charcoal burner or the
carrier pays £3 a year for a horse and £2 for a
donkey. Ten millions annually go to the army ;
some more to the navy, and a great deal to the
church. There must come a radical change in the
incidence of taxation and the modes of expendi-
ture ; and that change will have to be so radical
as to amount to a revolution.
Of all outgoings the people are most jealous of
that paid to church establishments. United Italy
from 1866 to 1901 seized the property of 64,445
religious bodies, whose yearly income amounted to
£2,344,404. Of these 45,337, with a yearly income
of .£1,964,000, were suppressed ; 6000 of them were
monasteries, and these the Government converted
into hospitals, barracks, museums and schools.
Other church property was seized and confiscated,
and an endowment for the income of priests was
made by the State. But this the people do not
now regard as a fair exchange. The church
property, they say, was originally paid for by the
people, and when it was seized, the people merely
took back their own ; and, on the other hand, they
regard taxation for the upkeep of a single priest
as a gross injustic.
The hope of a return to Papal temporal power
is the wildest of dreams. The Italian says of
temporal power : “ It denounced railways as irre-
ligious, and couldn’t even keep the streets of Rome
free from offal.” It was Bomba of Naples—the
beloved of the pontiff of 1866—who objected to rail-
ways because, he said, “tunnels were demoralis-
ing.” The Papal claim rests on the fact that 1400
years ago Phocas (afterwards Emperor of Con-
stantinople, but then a groom in the Imperial
service) killed the Emperor, the Empress, and
their five children, and made himself Emperor.
Pope Gregory the Great congratulated him, and,
in return, Phocas decreed that the Pope should
be “Universal Pope and Universal King.” Many
present - day dignitaries hold their dignities
on similarly flimsy foundations, and for 1400
years the Popes were Universal Kings—except
when they were under the thumbs of either poten-
tates at Constantinople, or feudal lords, or Western
kings, which was often. It is further alleged that
forfivejiundred years the Pope has been in the
hands of the Jesuits, which is probably untrue.
The more tolerant Italians say of the Pope,
“Poor creature —he has to do as he is bid.” But
that does not make his rule the more light or the
mor6 right—although it is the position of almost
every ruler on earth to-day. The widest stretch
of imagination cannot make King Edward a real
Emperor.
The laws are stringent against any attempt to
reinstate temporal power, providing heavy fines
and gaol punishments against priests “who
abuse their office to the damage of the nation and
its free institutions; who censure the institutions
and laws of the State, or who damage legitimate
private interests, or who disturb the peace of
families.”
And the surest proof that Papal power is gone
for ever from Italy is the monument of United
Italy in the Street of the Twentieth September
at Rome, by the old gateway of the Porta Pia—the
monument to “Victory and Rome Redeemed.”
The inscription in the granite is a living fact to
the Italian :
When, to universal right— Roman-like, asserted—the
Fates added the free conscience of Humanity, by this
breach Italy re-entered Rome.
No Christian resignation or religion in that. It
is the sternest citizen talk. Roman-like—Uni-
versal Right—The Fates —The Free Conscience
of Humanity.
Italy is emphatically not religious. Said Crispi
—“ To be a sincere Catholic and a friend of Italy
is a contradiction.” And Premier Zanardelli
recently said, in addressing his constituents at
Brescia, “ The Church appears better than it once
was; but has this improvement come about
because the Church is growing really better ?
Nothing of the kind. It is because the strong
arm of the law checks it. ”
Contrast this continuous childish attempt to re-
cover that power which was an anachronism
whenever it was not inoperative, and which has
gone for ever, with the magnificent treatment the
newly-emancipated nation gave the Church forty
years ago. When Young Revolution—agnostic
of everything but of its courage and its pike-
beat in the wall by the Porta Pia, and had the
Churoh at its mercy, it could have slain and
burned and wiped the Papacy from the earth.
Instead, it made princely concessions to the fallen,
and acted more magnanimously than any church-
man has ever done. And when King Humbert
lay murdered, the magnanimity was requited by
the Pope stating that he only tolerated the
memorial services to the dead. It is a pity that
the heirs rof Victor Emanuel 1., who braved ex-
communication to secure a United Italy, did not
also brave the church by a burial without service.
Thinking all these things, I said, with some
disgust: “ Why, the holding of political power by
any church in an age that produces a Marconi is
an insult to intelligence.”
“The English are a great people,” said my
American friend, with apparent irrelevance.
“ They’re all right,” I replied.
_ “ Well, they allow a House of Lords, and bishops
sit there and make laws. How’s that for temporal
power?”
I said that it was not quite the same thing.
“Not quite, but it’s only a question of degree.
And the people that allow churchmen to talk live
politics or make laws for live men are soft-headed.
A churchman never touches life really. He thinks
he knows something about death—but, on any
other subject but Heaven and Hell, his opinion is
valueless.”
So then we went to the sea wall and watched the
torpedo-boats come back to port. For Queen
Amelia and the Portuguese yacht had gone away.

Mr. H. Feder, of Prospect, South
Australia, sends us his photograph
and says:
“About two months ago I began to
feel badly all over. I was easily made
tired. I lost my appetite and was very
nervous. In a few days my arms and
neck were all broken out with large
boils. For weeks my suffering was
terrible. I tried remedy after remedy,
but without relief. A friend told me it
was not my skin but my blood that
needed help, and urged me to try Ayer’s
Sarsaparilla. He said he knew many
people who had been cured by it. I
bought a bottle, and I began to feel
better at once. My appetite returned,
my food digested better, and I felt
greatly encouraged. Before the bottle
was all used my blood was pure and
the boils had entirely disappeared.”

Boils, rashes, pimples, eruptions, eczema, etc., are but evidences of trouble

A BALLADE OF CAPTAIN STARLIGHT.
(Inscribed to Alfred Dampier.)
[For The Bulletin. ]
The plume, the helm, the flash of armour bright,
The call to arms, the clarion note of war,
The battle-steed full harnessed for the fight,
The warning beacon blazing from afar,
The warrior’s trust in his exultant star,
The beating heart that holds no thought of fear,
The joy of strife which nothing base can mar—
These were the glories of the days arrear.
The joust, the tourney, and the play of sword.
The flaunting pennon and the sheen of mail.
The knightly splendor of the banquet board,
The minstrel's harp, the bardic chanted tale,
The stoup of wine, the foaming beaded ale,
The hooded falcon and the flying deer,
The chase through covert, over hill and dale—
These were the glories of the days arrear.
We hare grown sordid, and our days are spent
In huokst’ring trifles in a grimy mart;
Farewell the moated keep, the warrior’s tent.
The glad great courage of the martial heart !
The world grows smaller, and the gods depart
And leave the earth a desert, dull and drear.
Farewell! Farewell 1 Our tears unbidden start
And fall in sorrow for the days arrear.
Some few among us make a desperate stand,
And fight as Titans fought in mythic times ;
Some take the highway in a new-found land ;
Some hurl at Circumstance their futile rhymes,
And curse a world of dollars and of dimes,
And rail at Fortune with divine despair—
The while they sing of golden far-off climes
That gleamed with glories in the days arrear.
Hadst thou but lived in those resplendent days,
When knightly creeds were short as knightly brand,
When nought was dearer than thy ladye’s praise,
And nought was fairer than her lily hand ; '
And nought but battle grim was half so grand ;
And nought so heartening as knightly cheer,
Thou mightst have reigned the ruler of the land—
A lord puissant of the days arrear.
L’Envov.
Captain, at least thou hadst a record rare
As one who faced his fate and felt no fear,
As one who knighthood’s mail didst ever wear
In the large manner of the days arrear.
F. J. Broomfield.
A female observer of human points is responsible for the
statement that Brightie Smith possesses the most elegant
feet to be found at the end of any Australian actress.
She certainly has a general appearance of being very
nicely finished-off.
“ P.X.": Apropot recent Bulletin remarks concerning
the staging of Popes. Froude translated and published a
16fch century French satire on Julius 11., which was
staged in Paris and made a sensation. One scene was at
the gate of Heaven. Julius had the key, but—“ What
the devil is this? The gate’s not opened ! Something is
wrong with the lock.” But Peter, who also appeared,
wouldn’t help ; and a warm argument followed, during
which the doorkeeper became very insulting, and the
curtain fell with the Pope still on the outside.
“ Pilsener," from Wellington (M.L.): The Maoriland
Brass Band tour is as dead a matter as pond water, but
since you have published one man’s screed on the sub-
ject you might as well let mine desolate the public also.
The chief reason why the band was a financial and social
failure was its lack of harmony and musical cohesiveness.
The bandsmen quarrelled on shipboard and broke up on
shore. Two of the big men carted their wives round with
them, at the expense of the common fund, and the bands-
men who had not thought to do likewise made things
sultry. All musicians are prone to anger, and some more
so than others. The cataclysm came in a stormy meeting
of the band and its several heads. At this meeting one
head was hurried from the room firmly gripped by the
slack of his trousseau, what time the second head argued
volubly with the third one as to the moneys expended.
Before this time half the original members had drifted
off, and the sorrowful remnants soon afterwards came
back to the land of the moa’s bones in three consign-
ments. They have since been interviewing pressmen in
successful endeavor to get their dirty garments made
blacker with printer’s ink.
“ Hiphen ” : “ Monsieur Beaucaire,” the American
sling-off at English old-world snobbery, gives food for
reflection. The hero—a Frenchman of the most virulent
type—wipes the stage with about six Englishmen ; and
the intelligent, discerning, and supposedly British-loving
audience applauds to the echo. Does this show that the
Australian cares not the face value of a politician’s oath
for the ill-treatment of the English by rabid foreigners ?
(If so, perish hopes of preferential trade.) Or does it
show the broad-mindedness of the British Lion’s whelp in
taking such tail-twists good-humoredly ? It may be only
a sign of Anglo-Saxon canniness, in always being “ in ”
with a winner ; or, again, the fact that the Frenchman is
royal may have something to do with it. Yet fancy such
a play being produced elsewhere ! If an Englishman on
the French stage, or a Jap. in Russia, were represented
as “ biffing” severely the men of those respective nations,
and winning the beauteous girl for his own, what would
the audience do ? Why, simply bite large bits off the
theatre and manager, cold-meat the leading man and
author (if handy), sneak the cash-box and leading lady,
and behave like a Melbourne football crowd. It is greatly
to this cold-blooded indifference that the English race
has got on in the world. Englishmen hav e never been
annoyed or bad-tempered when called liars or horse-
thieves by bilious foreigners. Not a bit ! They went on
carving another slice of territory off the globe and erect-
ing a few more churches and breweries. Many a bit of
territory has Britain got while foreigners were dancing
excitedly like cats on hot plates, and explaining how
wrong it was of that country to take the previous bit.
“B.”: Old John MTntyre played the Bailie for the
last night of the amateur “ Rob Roy,” in Melbourne.
He didn’t play it because he could play it, so presumably
he played it as a verra guid electioneering advertisement.
Old John recalls a performance that happened 40 years
lang syne at Bendigo (photos, show the juvenile
lead in duckskin pants and John in side-whiskers), and
exclaims : “Ma conscience 1 That was a performance.”
He always held the centre of the stage, with fierce lime-
juice beating on him, and his powerful Scotch voice has
been heard saying “ Ma conscience” many a time when a
political crisis was looming, and it was advisable to fix
public attention.
