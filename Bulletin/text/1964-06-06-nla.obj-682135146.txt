There’s no more exacting master than Tradition
The Yalumba tradition began with Samuel Smith who, in 1849, founded a vineyard to produce
wines equal to any in the world. A claret born of these concepts is Yalumba Galway Vintage.
Blended from Gabernet Sauvignon and Shiraz varieties, Galway Vintage is an elegant, yet
delightfully light, claret. Connoisseurs seek it out. Royal Show judges honour its quality. Galway
Vintage Claret, by Yalumba, is indeed worth asking for.

LETTERS
TO THE
EDITOR
CENSORSHIP
Sir,
. Mr Peter Coleman’s article (9/5/64)
is disingenuous—an example of trying to
have the best of both worlds: to say that
censorship is a good thing, but that the
censors ought not to ban innocuous
books like ‘The Group”.
But in his effort to be nice to the
censors and to everybody else, Mr Cole-
man ignores the real issue: from an an-
thropological point of view, he is right
about the declaratory nature of censor-
ship; but his comfortable article more
worthy of a woman’s weekly than of
The Bulletin simply ignores the
facts of Australian censorship. Why
are Dr Brissenden’s students in the
English Department at Canberra for-
bidden to study “Lolita”? Why are
3rd-year English students in this college
allowed to read “Lady Chatterley’s
Lover” so long as they borrow one of
the library’s two thumbed and battered
copies, but not to buy a copy for them-
selves? Why can't Professor Mays have
his copy of “Lolita”? Why can’t
Dr Brissenden include James Baldwin’s
“Another Country” in his course on
modern American literature at Canberra?
Why can’t I buy “Fanny Hill” if only
to make my own mind up between the
judgments of Mr Coleman and Margha-
nita Laski?
Mr Coleman, juries, sensible readers,
Mary McCarthy writing and rewriting
“the controversial chapters to eliminate
anything that would faintly distract
readers from her objective critique of
the influence of technology on sexual
life”— O God! O Montreal! Only Henry
Fielding could do justice to all this, but
I dare not mention “Tom Jones” in case
the declaratory censors look at that
hook and justifiably ban it after all,
>t outrages the manners, morals, and
mores of Highett much more than “The
Group” does.
If Mr Coleman wants to talk about
’civility” he might read Pope's “Dun-
ciad”. Pope would never have thought
fornication or a Sepik River statue quite
such an offence against civility as Nazi
gas-chambers or Communist terrorism.

CATHOLICS AND CONTRACEPTION
Sir,
Regarding the increasingly discussed
subject of Catholics and contraception, I
want to draw attention to your state-
ment (“Plain English”, 23/5/64) that
. . conventional birth control methods
are generally assumed to be widely used
by Catholics . . This could give non-
Catholics an entirely false impression of
their fellow Christians’ attitude to con-
troversial moral subjects. While it is
statistically impossible to prove or dis-
prove, what you wrote does not apply
to this country. There are two import-
ant reasons for this:
1. Contraception is classed as a
grievous sin which thereby bars Catholics
from receiving Holy Communion. The
numbers of married communicants
(which can be ascertained with reason-
able accuracy in residential suburbs or
country towns) would indicate that only
a very small number of practising
Catholics would use contraceptives.
2. Regardless of what individual rea-
soning by the laity or clergy may con-
tribute towards progressive thinking, the
Church has the infallible “last word”.
Catholics know this and accept the
Church’s strictures.
Your statement might have been more
applicable to France where 90 per cent
of the people are Catholics but where
only about 15 per cent attend church
regularly, the rest being “lapsed”.
As a Catholic who is scarcely quali-
fied to add his opinions to those of emi-
nent theologians, doctors, social workers
and the clergy, may I humbly suggest
that, to a layman, the Church’s intran-
sigence smacks of acute conservatism.
Christ founded the Church and it seems
strange that on the subject of “un-
natural ’ birth control the Church, since
earliest times, has consistently quoted
the Old Testament story of Onan which,
even if the ancient manuscript has been
translated with perfect accuracy, must
be read in the whole and odd sentences
not taken out of context.

MALTA
Sir,
I should be grateful if you would
allow me to correct a few inaccuracies
in your correspondent’s article on Malta
(23/5/64).
Napoleon occupied Malta in 1798, but
within two years the Maltese people
rebelled against the French and forced
the occupying garrison to surrender, with
the help of an English fleet under Lord
Nelson. Subsequently, of their own free
will, the Maltese leaders petitioned Bri-
tain to extend her protection to the
island, and this was granted. Since
1800, therefore, not by right of con-
quest or discovery, Malta was governed
by Britain.
Since that time the leaders of the Mal-
tese people have been incessantly cla-
moring for liberalised constitutions, and
several forms of representative govern-
ment were granted and suspended up to
the beginning of the second Great War,
followed by new constitutions in 1945
and 1958. As far back as 1920 a pro-
minent Maltese Nationalist condemned a
new constitution because it fell short of
the people’s aspirations for full consti-
tutional rights, so that it cannot really
be said that independence is being thrust
on Malta.
The Nationalist Party in office has a
long history in Maltese politics since
1881, and its founder is popularly known
as “Padre della Patria” (Father of the
Nation). His principles, modified with
the changing times, have been upheld byi
the Nationalist Party headed by the
Prime Minister, Dr Borg Olivier, who led
the country from 1950 to 1955, and who
was the Leader of the Opposition from
1955 to 1958. It certainly cannot be
said that “the real contestants for power”
are solely the Archbishop and Mr Min-i
toff, and there are besides another three
smaller parties represented in the Malta!
Parliament.
The statement that only parish regis-l
ters exist in Malta is quite incorrect. All!
acts of birth, death, marriage, etc., are
recorded in the Public Registry Office in
Valletta. So is the sweeping statement)
that the Church feast days provide thei
only entertainment for 40 per cent of!
the people, who, partly on account of
the magnificent all-the-year-round cli-
mate in Malta, are entertainment-minded
to a remarkable extent.
The number of Maltese persons hap-
pily settled in Australia is not far of
100,000, so that the population ratio of
emigrants to inhabitants in Malta is
nearer 1:3 than 1:19, Malta’s populatioa
now being in the region of 3 26,000,

“BATMAN”
Sir,
It has been borne upon us for some 1
time that “Batman’s” role was one oil
“damning with faint praise”. As The
Bulletin’s spokesman in the provincial
capital of Victoria, we skim through his
lofty condescensions and weep with hiitii
in his lamentations in and around Mel-
bourne.
His “Black Sunday for the Port Girls’
(9/5/64) was miserable stuff, his point-
less disclosure of the ages of the captain
and his wife insulting and the (doubtless)'
comic relief of the deodorant more
nauseating than the whale odor. As anj
effort of description it was infantile
The equally unpleasant smell of sour l
grapes rose above the blubber.
If, as we sense, he has been affronted
by the orderliness of the visitors and if
as we feel sure, he is conscious that|
Sydney would have put on a better sho"<
then let him say so and cease his drivel

water shortage
Water is a problem throughout
Hong Kong, but not at the
Hongkong Hilton. The hotel
has huge storage tanks for
drinking water and its own
wells for bath water. The air-
conditioning and sanitation
systems use sea water.
So the Hongkong Hilton won’t
ever run out of water—but if it
did there’d still be plenty of.
Australian beer. And you’ll find
Australian beef in the
restaurants; blankets of
Australian lamb's wool; even a
special Australian Room,
featuring Australian materials
and objets d’art.
The Hongkong Hilton is right
at the heart of Hong Kong’s
major business and govern-
mental district. There are three
famous restaurants. And
fifty of the finest free port
shops have branches right in
the hotel’s arcade.
For reservations, see your
travel agent, or call any Hilton

tralia’s overseas land war in World
War I and World War II”, puts the whole
of the facts quite out of proportion.
Leaving out the ancillary service volumes
and Rabaul, where only a few shots were
fired, the real military writing in World
War I was distributed as follows: Six
volumes, 3800 pages, written by Bean
largely from his own 300 volumes of
notes made or collected on the spot—
going on for two million words of in-
tensive, detailed reporting in which it is
difficult to find a waste sentence. Cut-
lack wrote the Air Force volume and
Harry Gullett the Light Horse volume.
Total, three authors who had help from
none of the intensively organised histori-
cal sections, public relations officers and
trained observers who were underfoot
from the first shot in World War 11.
Bean's feat is about the most sustained
in personal on-the-spot reporting in the
history of war. In World War II the
military part of the war was covered
by eight authors with all the aids which
Bean didn't have at their disposal and
their work contains very large slabs of
what can only be described as loosely
written padding and public relations stuff,
some of which I have criticised in re-
viewing individual volumes.

TRADE WITH RED CHINA
Sir,
Some Australian trading organisations
and business firms who have traded with
Communist China recently received
lengthy cables from Peking. These
cables probably each cost £lOO. They
referred to six Chinese traders and three
pressmen arrested by the Brazilian
Government on charges of espionage
and subversion.
On April 21 last Peking Radio broad-
cast the following news item: “Twelve
Chinese national foreign trade corpora-
tions have appealed to world trade cir-
cles to exercise their influence and help
bring about the release of arrested Chi-
nese in Brazil. The Chinese corpora-
tions on Sunday sent messages to 1700
trade organisations and enterprises in
more than 70 countries and areas. They
noted that, far from releasing the Chi-
nese personnel, the Brazilian authorities
subjected them to all kinds of tortures
and persecutions. This atrocity, com-
mitted at the instigation of US imperial-
ism, constituted a total violation of the
elementary principles of international
law and infringement on fundamental
human rights. The Chinese corpora-
tions stressed that if this outrage is not
resolutely crushed, normal international
trade and friendly contact would be
seriously undermined and human dignity
could not be guaranteed.”
On April 22 Peking Radio reported:
“Among those who have responded to
the appeal are trade organisations of
Korea, Japan, the Sudan, Australia,
etc.”
Even though the Peking Government
is doing no more than implementing its
publicly stated policy that “economics
and politics are indivisible”, surely the
leaders of our trade organisations must
now realise that they cannot keep trade
with Communist China on a purely busi-
ness basis and ignore the political con-
sequences.

NAZIS AND THE VATICAN
Sir,
I have no intention of polemising with
Mr Denham’s view on the Vatican’s
hostile attitude to the Nazis (23/5/64).
It is a fact that both the Holy See and
German Catholic bishops issued several
sharp denunciations of the Nazi regime.
However, it is also a fact that several
chauvinistic German prelates openly
flaunted the Holy See's policy in Central
and Eastern Europe during the war.
The late Archbishop Splett, former
German Archbishop ©f Gdansk (Dan-
zig), had excellent relations with the
Nazi Gauleiter Forster and often gave
him valuable political support.
In September, 1939, Archbishop Splett
refused to help Polish Catholic clergy
or Polish inhabitants of the former “Free
City”, then hunted like wild animals by
Forster's “Danziger-SS” and “Danziger-
Heimwehr”. He pointedly declined to
intervene on behalf of the hundreds of
Polish priests and postal workers, cus-
toms and police officials executed by the
Nazis, took over the administration of
parts of Polish dioceses in the former
“Polish Corridor” (in violation of the
pre-war Concordat with Poland) and
prohibited the use of the Polish language
in churches under his administration.
Archbishop Splett also decreed that a
special blessing of “the Fuhrer and his
armed forces” be recited in churches
under his control.
Archbishop Splett’s actions only tend
to emphasise the Vatican's official
opposition to the Nazi regime and should
be known for the sake of historical
truth.

JULES VERNE
Sir,
In Dr Alan Brissenden’s review of
“The Compleat Migrant"’ (2/5/64) he
states that “the book . . . can almost
take its place beside Jules Verne's
‘Amongst the Cannibals’ (1867), as an
entertaining presentation of misconcep*
tions. Verne had some excuse, how-
ever small, for the romanticised hotch-
potch of Amazon-deepest Africa that he
described for the Victorian Gippsland;
he never came to Australia"’.
There is an important misconception
here, for presumably Dr Brissenden is
rather referring to “On the Track”,
which does describe an imaginary
journey across Victoria, following the
37th parallel of latitude. “On the
Track” is the English title of the second
part of the 1868 (not 1867, as stated
in the review) trilogy, “Les Enfants du
Capitaine Grant”, whilst “Amongst the
Cannibals” is the third part and deals
with the crossing of New Zealand.

Outrage
lUe went along to the “Outrage” exhibi-
" tion at Farmer's Blaxland Galleries
a few days ago. The exhibition is the first
ishot in the campaign of the Royal Aus-
tralian Institute of Architects to “im-
prove the appearance of Sydney and its
suburbs.” The exhibition of photographs
ef what the architects consider unsightly
is combined with pictures of recent build-
ing designs. We were somewhat relieved
to find that we were not the only visitors
to the exhibition to find the distinction
between the two a trifle blurred. Many of
the new buildings were on sites as barren
Mid squalid, with no hint of future im-
provement, as anything shown in the
“Outrages.”
One “improvement” likely to be
effected soon to Sydney is the provision of
a fountain at Chifley Square. Chifley
Square, which would have
been an elegant circus if
the Commonwealth Gov-
ernment had adhered to
the original plan and built
to complement Qantas
House, has for some
months been a small area
of virgin soil, strewn with rubbish and
rich in weeds.
At present the Square is ornamented
only with a handsome noticeboard which
reads:
“This area was officially named Chifley
Square in memory of the late the Right
Honorable J. B. Chifley, MP, the former
Prime Minister of Australia and upon
this site the Council proposes to honor
the Square by the erection with citizen
assistance of a Fountain of conception
and design commensurate with the im-
portance of the area.”
When people in authority have such a
chancy grip on their everyday language,
ji is no wonder our city looks the way
it does.
No Mass Production
new to the knock-down,
drag-out field of politely gloved
trade promotion, Greece has kicked off
Wlt h a delegation to Australia that
admits straight away it hasn't much to
Sc 'h Having said this, with a rueful
ru g of immaculate shoulders, the
English-speaking spokesman, Rodolfos
assured us that what
" ls country does have is worth buying
anc l can help distribute a little genuine
eu Phoria.
Australia, he said vehemently, has
” ever yet tasted the delights of true
ttica retsina. His firm makes this
other wines as well as ouzo and
an excellent brandy. “Retsina dates back
to ancient times, when the exporters
coated the urns with resin to make the
wine travel well. The taste was acquired
and now retsina is a drink of the gods.
One glass and no one can worry!”
It appears the only retsina so far on
sale here emanates from Samos which,
while it produces nourishing, full-bodied
sweet wines, has never been noted for
the beverage which was born within
sound of the Acropolis owls. Whether
we, too, will acquire the habit he is here
to find out.
Besides wine, the delegation hopes to
drum up sales for their olive oil (“pure
and rich”), dolmades, okra, fetta and
other foodstuffs beloved of the Greek
isles. “We heard that Australians enjoy
experimenting with food. I am sure they
would appreciate some of the delicacies
we have to offer.”
Nor is it all one way,
Mr Periklis Papazoglou
hopes to buy our wool
direct instead of through
the London market
w'hile amiable Dimitri
Trangos is taking a close
look at our frozen meat.
But all would like the trade to develop
into a two-way affair. Not that it could
ever be on a 50-50 basis. “We are not
like Italy. We have no manufacturing
industries to speak of,” said Mr Chrys-
santhopoulos sadly. And then he smiled.
“Of course we do have our handi-
crafts. Loomed blankets, rugs, fine
tweeds and colorful bags. I know the
Australians would like those. But those
are things we have no difficulty market-
ing. Ah,” he sighed, “if only handi-
crafts could be mass produced!”
Looking for Leichhardt
latest expedition to go looking for
Ludwig Leichhardt’s remains left
Toowoomba (Q) at the weekend. It is a
two-man expedition travelling in a four-
wheel-drive, army-type “blitz” truck and
it is heading due west from Toowoomba
towards the Simpson Desert in Central
Australia.
Ludwig Leichhardt left Jimbour
Station in the Roma District, near Too-
woomba, in 1848 with six men and 77
horses, bullocks and mules. He was to
head north, and then west, across to Port
Essendon in Western Australia and down
the Western Australian coast to Perth.
But the two men on the present
expedition believe he headed due west
and became lost in the Simpson Desert.

Les Martin. Both are well-known in
Southern Queensland as naturalists.
Their theory is not a new one. Leich-
hardt’s remains were believed to have
been found by the most important
modern expedition sponsored by the
South Australian Government in 1938.
This expedition found bones, teeth,
bits of leather and a few coins on the
south-western edge of the Simpson
Desert. The coins bore early 1840 dates.
This find was generally accepted as the
remains of the ill-fated Leichhardt ex-
pedition. However, historians have been
puzzled by the fact that no trace was
ever found of the 77 animals which ac-
companied the party.
Martin and Moncreif hope to solve the
mystery once and for all. They believe
that Leichhardt was such a poor bush-
man that he could have headed into the
Simpson, where his chances of survival
would be slim. Their four-wheel drive
blitz truck is well-equipped with water
and petrol supplies as well as an adequate
food supply. It will have a two-way
radio and once the party pushes out
from the last outpost of civilisation at
Bedourie they will check in with the
Flying Doctor radio network with a
daily position.
In this way they hope to avoid any
costly search parties being sent out for
them because of otherwise lengthy
silences. Loaded on the blitz will be a
motorcycle and rifles. The motorcycle
will be used to make quick side excur-
sions from their route and enable them
to cover a lot more ground than was
previously possible by other parties.
Mr Moncreif hopes to gather material
for a novel in the trackless wasteland of
the Simpson. He is also taking a tape
recorder. With it he hopes to prove a
theory that dingoes winter in the desert,
moving into the sheep and cattle country
for their marauding trips in the summer.
The tapes will be used as a background
for radio and TV talks.
The expedition is believed to be the
best equipped ever made in the search
for Leichhardt. Martin and Moncreif
have set no time limit for their 1500-mile
trip.

A much the WA Art Gallery paid for
Henry Moore’s “Reclining Figure,
1956”. The gallery set the work in
position with the aid of a fork-lift last
week but refuses to divulge the price.
Gallery board chairman Claude Hotchin
said the price, paid from the State
Government’s £38,000 grant, was
“something best not gone into”. Ther*
was “a certain cheapness about reveal
ing prices,” he claimed, adding tantalis
ingly that it was the biggest purchasi
the gallery had made.
Premier Brand said he did not knov
the price himself, but the Governmea
was content to let the gallery make it
own purchases. Possibly even genia
Mr Brand paled a little, as many othen
did, when Sothebys, the London a(
auctioneers, said the price tag cod]
have been as high as £18,750 Australia*
and was at least £12,500.
There are -seven other larger-than-lifei
size bronze casts of “Reclining Figure
1956”—four in the US, two in Britaii
and the other in Berlin. Mr Hotchi
described Perth’s purchase of the eight
—the only one in the Southern Hem

the gallery will be even braver and sa|
how much this courage cost.

PLAIN ENGLISH
Jawaharlal Nehru
TN the death of Jawaharlal Nehru
India has lost the greatest poli-
tical architect of her young demo-
cracy and the world one of its most
persuasive influences against war
and for peaceful international co-
operation. His death came at a
time when his powers were already
failing. But the loss is felt intensely
and universally because the man
embodied some of the finest aspira-
tions and achievements of this
anguished century.
At independence India’s future
looked bleak indeed. A country of
innumerable castes, sects, languages
and cultures; a vast and rapidly
growing population enslaved to
poverty, disease, ignorance, and
gross social injustice; a society torn
by communal riots, deluged by mil-
lions of uprooted refugees from its
neighboring State, and threatened
by organised extremist groups and
parties. It was an ideal situation
for chaos and dictatorship. There
were, however, a few hopeful fac-
tors, the most important being the
legacy of a modern administrative
system and the presence of a demo-
cratically-minded intelligentsia. On
their own they seemed hardly cap-
able of saving India from disorder,
not to speak of developing her into
a stable modern democracy. Yet
the unlikely did happen thanks
primarily to Nehru’s leadership.
Nehru’s strength lay in a para-
doxical combination of apparently
contrary personal qualities, which is
almost unique in modern history.
Unlike Gandhi, he was truly a mod-
ern intellectual, fully committed to
rationalism, secularism, the scien-
tific outlook, democratic principles
and practices and industrialisation
as essential to the conquest of
poverty and social injustice. This
made him the most outstanding
spokesman of India’s liberal urban
intelligentsia. But, at the same time,
like Gandhi, he had the great gift
of identifying himself with the vast
majority of the rural population of
his country, with their sufferings
k and hopes, of winning their love
and faith, and of inspiring them
with his revolutionary endeavors.
He thus became the bridge between
the forward-looking intellectual
minority and the tradition-bound
millions. Without this bridge India’s
history might have been very dif-
ferent from what it has been since
her independence in 1947.
Under Nehru’s leadership, India
in the last 17 years has not only
been forged into a nation, but has
grown into possibly the stablest
democracy outside the Western
world. Three general elections on
the basis of adult franchise and
without any restrictions on basic
civil and political liberties have
proved that democracy can work,
even in an economically under-
developed country. A traditional
hierarchical society has been peace-
fully oriented towards unambigu-
ously egalitarian ideals, and is en-
gaged in changing its institutions to
suit the new ethos. Disabilities and
restrictions from which women and
the lowest castes have always suf-
fered have been largely removed,
and measures have been undertaken
to promote grass-roots democracy
through community projects and
panchayats. In 12 years a semi-
feudal economy has come to witness
the beginnings of an industrial-revo-
lution, the benefits of which may
already be felt to some extent, even
in the rural areas.
"MEHRU’S influence on India’s
foreign policy has been equally
decisive as on her domestic develop-
ments. He put a brake on India’s
nascent chauvinism and distrust of
the West, and persuaded the leaders
of the young republic to continue
India’s membership of the British
Commonwealth. India’s unreserved
support of the United Nations in its
efforts to strengthen international
peace and co-operation owes a great
deal to his leadership. His policy
of non-alignment has often been
under attack in the West, and of
late even in India its wisdom was
being to some extent disputed.
However pertinent some of the
criticisms may be, its popular sup-
port and some of its more positive
achievements can hardly be under-
rated. It saved India from the temp-
tations of militarism, so strong in
economically under-developed and
politically unstable societies, and
made it possible for her to devote
most of her limited energies and
resources to peaceful social and
economic reconstruction. It contri-
buted in no small measure to re-
strict the extension of the cold war,
and possibly even to the present
easing of tensions between the two
power blocs. In any case, it was
born of a genuine desire for peace,
and in this reflected the sentiments
of ordinary men and women all
over the world.
Of course, Nehru was not with-
out his failures and shortcomings.
Hi s internationalism, although
genuine, did not prove strong
enough to settle India’s disputes
with Pakistan. His non-alignment
sometimes looked a trifle am-
biguous. He did not sufficiently
prepare India against the greatest
threat to its survival as a demo-
cracy, the threat from Communist
China. Moreover, his charismatic
personality which helped to unify
and modernise India in a peaceful
manner was hardly consonant with
his basic democratic ideals and
aspirations. No one knew this better
than Nehru himself. Nevertheless,
when one balances these shortcom-
ings against his achievements, there
is little doubt that the latter heavily
outweigh the former.
Nehru’s passing marks the close
of the Heroic Age in modern India’s
history. He is not likely to be suc-
ceeded by another charismatic
leader. This is not because India
has no such potential leaders to-
day (one readily thinks of Vinoba
Bhave and Jayaprakash Narayan).
The fact seems to be that such
leadership is no longer necessary or
required by the situation. Indian
democracy has at last come to stay.
For accomplishing this near miracle,
[ndia and the world can never be
grateful enough to Jawaharlal
Nehru.

THIS AUSTRALIA
THE ALP
What Must Happen
at the June Conference
The Machine v. the Robots
FROM ALAN REID IN CANBERRA
T«e Parliamentarians v. Machine
A struggle in the ALP will intensify
this month if, as is likely, the NSW
ALP June Conference tries to get
Federal Labor Parliamentarians restored
from their present status of vassalage to
a position of influence.
Most Parliamentarians and probably
the bulk of ALP rank and file supporters
accept the fact that the 36 faceless men
charge against the Federal ALP Con-
ference and the Federal ALP Executive,
with its underlying suggestion that
Federal Labor Parliamentarians were
puppets controlled from outside Parlia-
ment, was a major factor in Labor’s
heavy Federal electoral reverse last year.
But, understandably, the controllers of
the machine are not prepared to accept
that judgment and are ready to fight
reform tooth and nail.
The extent to which the ALP con-
trollers are prepared to go and a
further revelation of the ruthlessness
with which they are ready to enforce
machine supremacy is shown in their
treatment of Mr E. J. '(“Jim”) Harrison,
Federal Labor member for the Sydney
seat of Blaxland. Harrison cannot be
described as Right Wing, Left Wing or
Grouper. He is a Labor traditionalist
with the type of impeccable trade union
background which usually causes a Labor
man to incline towards a measure of
control by the machine over the Par-
liamentarians. Harrison also is the
Federal Labor Caucus expert on rail
transport and standardisation and for
some years has been regarded by the
Caucus and Government alike as the
Labor successor to the late Percy Clarey
as the Opposition’s most senior and
authoritative spokesman on industrial
matters.
But trifles like that do not worry the
machine. The machine has set up some
14 committees to deal with the detailed
implementation of policies which it has
laid down. These committees duplicate
in many cases the Caucus committees
set up to deal with economics, social ser-

Crushed
vices, immigration, transport and indus-
trial matters. As the machine is the real
policy maker, their committees are tend-
ing increasingly to remove control over
detail from the Parliamentary Labor
Party and to hand it over to the machine.
When the Opposition Leader, Mr A. Cal-
well, nominated Mr Harrison for the
ALP committees on transport and indus-
trial matters the machine wiped both Mr
Calwell and Mr Harrison. It refused to
accept the nominations.
Now Mr Harrison has been elected
by the Federal Parliamentary Labor
Party to the Caucus industrial committee
with the largest vote cast for any
individual standing for this committee
and to the transport committee. He is
an official of both committees and as
such will be entitled to a seat on the
machine committees dealing with trans-
port and industrial matters. But it is in
spite of the machine and not because of
it that he will be on the committees.
Harrison’s offence is easily discover-
able, if his confidential report to the NSW
ALP Executive, which invited all Par-
liamentarians to put down frankly their
assessment of reasons for Labor’s Federal
electoral reverse, is studied. Harrison,
who was sick in hospital at the time,
apparently took the invitation seriously
and tried to think through the problems
confronting Labor thoroughly and con-
structively. In so doing he criticised til
machine controllers. Deploring thl
erosion of Labor strength in countr
districts historically part of Labor'
backbone Harrison wrote: “It 1
incongruous to suggest that party policy

HEALTH FUNDS
Pay More, Sooner or Later
A stronger case than ever for reforming the
National Health Scheme
FROM RICHARD HALL IN SYDNEY
The omens are that Australians will
have to pay higher contributions
to their medical benefits funds.
This is the cold fact behind the flurry
of statements over the past few weeks
which began with the Federal Minister
for Health’s rejection of applicah°,
from the Hospitals Contribution F un
of NSW for extensions of improvenien
in its cover in the old established 0
pitals fund and the fledgling me i c
benefits section of its operations.


Also in the confusion of the break-up
'between HCF and the Medical Benefits
Fund last year, when they ended their
'administrative merger, there was bitter-
jess on both sides. It was inevitable
.'that both organisations would extend to
jet up rivals to the other the MBF
'establishing its own hospital fund and
fee HCF its own medical scheme.
| Senator Wade rejected the HCF appli-
cations for wider benefits in both the hos-
pital and medical funds. Then within a
iveek the HCF actuary, Mr G. L. Mel-
ville, and its Vice-Chairman, Mr M. J.
O’Neill, resigned. While the actuary
merely announced his resignation in
telegrams to the newspapers without
jiving any reasons, O’Neill explained
hat he had opposed a too hasty expan-
sion of the medical benefits side.
But this still did not account for the
Banket rejection of both hospital and
hedical extensions and increases. Behind
his rejection was the Federal Govern-
nent’s desire to damp down competition
dween the Funds. What was behind
his is best summed up in a paragraph
n Senator Wade’s letter to the HCF.
An extensive survey has been made of
he most recent financial experience of
aedical benefits organisations. As a
esult of this survey it is clear that
rends in medical benefits funds are some-
what disturbing and this is particularly
o in the higher medical tables.”
If the financial trends are “somewhat
listurbing”, the Government's motives
a damping down any fierce competition
re obvious. Whether the HCF is right
r not in its confidence that it can pay
le extra benefits, the Minister’s action
■ directed at the wider problem. The
Commonwealth Department of Health,
a an unofficial way (after the style of
the Reserve Bank “suggestions” to the
private banks) has directed that there
should be no fresh moves to adjust funds
benefits or tables until November.
A hint of the inevitability of rises in
contributions came in Senator Wade's
speech to the Senate last month in sup-
port of the new Commonwealth pay-
ments increases. He said that “at a
later date the new fund benefit tables
would be providing for payments of
higher benefits to contributors who elect
to pay higher contributions.”
The question is when “the later date”
will come up for the millions of contri-
butors to Australian medical funds.
There were some kites flown last week
about the possibility of HCF standing
up to the Government and going ahead
with its new benefits. Under the legis-
lation the Government could then de-
register it, but it could then appeal to
a single Supreme Court judge. How-
ever, such action is unlikely because of
the likely flight of contributors.
So any review is unlikely before the
end of the “freeze” period in November.
During the HCF-MBF imbroglio last
year many people felt that there was a
case for a review of the whole National
Health Scheme and a thorough investi-
gation of the operation of funds.
Last week a prominent Maitland
hospital administrator, Mr C. L. Robin-
son, called an immediate Government
inquiry into the HCF. “Something is
being withheld from the public,” he said
to which the HCF replied, “too
ridiculous for words”.
But the Minister’s phrase “some-
what disturbing” still unchallenged,
there now seem even better grounds for
a good long hard look at the medical
funds before the end of the year.

I I ln the Labor movement. Above all,
it demonstrated the contempt of Vic-
toria’s union leaders, not only for the
convenience of the public, but for its
intelligence.
The unions wanted an extra week’s
leave for their members to bring them
up to the level of leave granted to NSW
Government employees. They also claim-
ed increases in the basic wage and mar-
gins on the grounds that in private in-
dustry over-award payments averaging
£4 a week were being made.
In private industry, over-award pay-
ments are a result of the constantly
changing supply-and-demand position in
the labor market. A worker whose par-
ticular skill is in strong demand will
readily get a wage above the award rate
but his gain may be ephemeral. When
conditions are slacker, he may be the
first to be dismissed.
The workers in the public segment are
probably well aware of this, and equally
aware that their employment conditions
are more stable than those of workers in
many sections of private industry. They
are also aware that over-award payments
written into Public Service conditions
would not be merely ephemeral, but
would remain there forever.
Less than 14 hours before the strike
was due to start, the Opposition Leader,
Mr C. Stoneham, made a bold bid to
have it called off. Together with the
State President of the ALP, Mr R. W.
Holt, he conferred with the Executive
of the Trades Hall Council on a com-
promise plan he had drawn up. This
plan (reported to have been suggested
by Alan Fraser, MHR, who has been
appointed to plan the ALP’s publicity
for the State elections), was to have Mr
D. G. Apsey, a retired Commonwealth
Conciliation and Arbitration Com-
missioner, now living in Sydney, act as
mediator in the dispute.
The Labor Leader spent 30 minutes
with the THC officials and he looked
pleased as he left the Trades Hall. All
he said was that he would go to Parlia-
ment and sit by the phone to await a call.
The call came, but it was not the news
Mr Stoneham expected. It was to tell
him that the THC Executive had decided
that, “despite the soundness of the pro-
position”, it regretted that “the time
factor makes it impossible for the Dis-
putes Committee to be reconvened for
the purpose of discussing this sugges-
tion”.
The main point about the THC rejec-
tion of the Stoneham Plan was the
hypocritical grounds it gave. It implied
that Melbourne was without telephones
or telegrams.
Had the THC agreed to the Stoneham
Plan, his next step would have been to
get Government agreement. Mr Bolte
was obviously a bit restive while Mr
Stoneham was at work. The Labor
Leader might have emerged as the hero
of the hour. After the plan was defeated,
Bolte said it was a “fool idea”.
The way it went, the strike was a
complete moral victory for Mr Bolte,
and a serious slap for Mr Stoneham.
It suggests that his authority is at a very
low ebb within the Labor movement he
purports to lead.

LAW
Scientology as Brainwashing?
i6 A form of Blackmail”?
FROM A MELBOURNE CORRESPONDENT
Dince it opened last December, Vic-
toria’s Board of Inquiry into Scien-
tology has been mainly concerned with
hearing evidence from Scientology apo-
logists and ex-Scientologists like Mr P.
B. Wearne (see The Bulletin, May 23).
Early in the Inquiry there had been a
promise that psychiatrists, members of
the local branch of the British Psycho-
logical Society and other experts would
give evidence. After all it was partly the
condemnation of Scientology by Uni-
versity authorities, the Australian Medi-
cal Association and various public health
officials which led to the Inquiry being
held.
Dr E. Cunningham Dax, who gave
evidence last week, was the first of these
eminent critics. He is chairman of
Victoria’s Mental Health Authority and
a world figure in his field. He told the
Inquiry he had examined a great deal of
Scientology literature and said it seemed
to have been written by persons suffering
from paranoid schizophrenia.
Dr Dax was asked by Mr K. V. An-
derson, QC, who is conducting the
Inquiry, whether it was likely that the
founder of Scientology, Mr L. Ron
Hubbard, believed his own claim that
he had travelled into the Van Allen
radiation belt in the ionosphere. Dr Dax
said that it was possible that Hubbard
might have been trying to keep two
jumps ahead of the incredible claims
made by his more senior students.
Dr Dax said the aims of Scientology
seemed to be to indoctrinate its followers
mto a blind acceptance of its principles
and to spread them wider for the satis-
faction of Hubbard's lust for power.
If was also a scheme for raising money
through selling propaganda material
which made false statements. The
“security check used on Scientology
adherents was, in Dr Dax's view, a form
of blackmail. It used questions similar
to those in Communist Chinese “brain-
washing techniques.
After Dr Dax had given evidence, the
Inquiry heard from Professor Leslie John
R ay , who holds the Chair of Anatomy at
Melbourne University. In cross-examin-
ation, Professor Ray was asked by Mr
I. G. Abraham (for the Scientologist)
whether he believed in a soul or not.
Mr Anderson disallowed the question,
since the Inquiry was not “some sort of
convocation probing ecclesiastical or
theological matters”.
The Inquiry is due to hear further
evidence from medical and psychological
experts in the coming weeks. Among
those who have expressed alarm at
Scientology teachings have been
academics at Melbourne University, and
the public is wondering if any of them
will appear to describe any actual case-
histories of students’ careers suffering
through involvement with the Hubbard
organisation.
THE LORD S DAY
ffiJ&ulletCn
80 years ago: June 7, 1884
The N.S.W. Society for the Obser-
A vance of the Lord's Day, in
their recently published progress re-
port, refers to “the necessity for those
who love the Sabbath to bestir them-
selves in order to preserve the inesti-
mable boon which the goodness of
God has provided for mankind.” If
they had their own sour will, they
would brand with crime the impious
wretch who takes a walk in the coun-
try on the Lord's Day. These wicked
bigots must be kept in check. Those
who love freedom of opinion and
believe in perfect toleration must be
up and doing, agitating persistently
for the repeal of the odious Caroline
statutes that are a disgrace to our
civilization. The S.O.L.D. has political
power; therefore is there all the more
necessity to agitate, agitate, agitate
for a free Sunday, “that inestimable
boon” of which the wickedness of
bigots would deprive mankind.
THE POLICE
The Camera and the Constable
£82/5/-costs against the Police
FROM ROBERT KLIMA IN SYDNEY
HThe affair of the Sydney University
A students’ Commemoration Day
demonstration outside the United States
Consulate which began as a naive stunt
and ended in a riot is by no means
over, and a successful legal fight by a
television cameraman against an offen-
sive behavior charge is only the first
of what will be a series of cases.
Richard McNicoll, a television camera-
man, had been charged with offensive
behavior, but after listening for two and
a half days to prosecution witnesses, the
magistrate, Mr Scarlett, SM, last week
dismissed the charge without waiting for
any defence evidence. Further, the
magistrate awarded £B2 ss. costs against
the arresting policeman, Constable
George Schmitzer, of the plainclothes 21
Division.
Schmitzer had told the court McNicoll
hit him in the face with his camera after
pushing through a crowd.
But McNicoll's barrister, Mr R. A.
Howell retained by McNicoll’s em-
ployers, ATN Channel 7 produced
nearly 200 still photographs and enlarge-
ments of strips of film taken during
the demonstration and cross-examined
Schmitzer sharply on them: “I put it to
you that your version is completely
fasle?”
Constable Schmitzer: “No”.
Mr Howell produced a film which,
Schmitzer agreed, showed a man gripping
McNicoll’s hair from behind and push-
ing his head down. Schmitzer could not
identify himself as the man, although he
agreed he would have been in the same
position and wearing a similar hat and
suit.
After looking at the photographs Mr
Scarlett said they showed events entirely
different to what the police said took
place.
“The implications in this case are a
matter of grave concern. I feel that in
the absence of the photographs it might
well have been that the defendant would
have been convicted.”
He said costs against the police should
be allowed only in exceptional circum-
stances and these were exceptional
circumstances.
There are still more than 20 charges
against students, in connection with the
riot, to be heard and more than six
counsel have been briefed to defend
them.
Photographs and films of the demon-
stration will be used extensively in the
defence.

FROM A PERTH CORRESPONDENT
H. OPPERMAN
Appeals
The story of how two Perth part-
Aboriginal babies have been taken
behind the Iron Curtain reads like some-
thing out of a cheap spy novelette. The
children are reported to have been taken
to Russia so they can be trained to return
to Australia and lead their people.
The beginnings of the plot go back
six years when two eccentric (slacks-and-
cigars) women set up a kindergarten in
the Perth suburb of Morley. Rene Heis-
ler is a 47-year-old sculptress, born of
Jewish parents in Czechoslovakia, gain-
ing British citizenship “through wartime
service”. Joan Smith, 35, her intimate
friend, was a mathematics teacher in
Victoria before working with the Child
Welfare Department in Perth. Based
on the kindergarten, the two founded
Eslanda Independent School. They told
parents the name had been made up:
Every Scholar Learns, Aspires, Notices,
Discusses, Achieves. It is also a first-
name—used by Mrs Paul Robeson. The
two talked Leftish jargon but when asked
her politics, Mrs Heisler gave the stock
reply: “I have never been a member
of the Communist Party.”
Eslanda attracted children of leading
professionals and academics in Perth.
At the frequent parents’ meetings, the
cliches were “progressive”. The school’s
classes were small, taught by specialist
teachers. Many of the ideas were good
and ahead of other schools. Eslanda
w as among the first schools in WA to
llse Cuisenaire rods and even tried
Trachtenberg “miracle maths” method.
Aboriginal women were always treat-
ed as friends; one was a fine kindergar-
ten teacher; several left their children at
the school, sometimes for months.
Last November Joan Smith and Rene
Heisler went into smoke. Parents were
told Eslanda would continue, but there
Were reports of the two going to Russia
with two Aboriginal babies, and were not
surprised when only the kindergarten re-
sumed this year, and under new manage-
ment. Dr Joe Marian has been given
power of attorney to sell off the property
and pay Eslanda debts.
The two babies are 15-month-old John
Vincenti and two-year-old Barry Me-
Kenzie. Joan Smith introduced Barry
to hei Victorian sistei-in-law, Mrs Jim
Carstairs, as my foster-son Patrice , and
John was known as Ricki. The mothers
of both boys were pregnant and said
at the time they had welcomed the offer
to take their babies on holidays.
When in February Kathy Trimmer
(Barry’s mother) finally appealed to
newspapers to have her son returned,
Joan Smith sent a telegram: “Don’t
panic, Kathy. Not moving. Write and be
friendly Joan.” At this time, when
the children had been away nine weeks,
Mrs Heather Vincenti also said: “I knew
Mrs Smith could give John a better life
and education than I could. I have only
a £lO pension and three other children
to look after.” She approved Mrs
Smith’s application for a passport for
John. This was issued on September 4
—five months before the telegram about
“not moving”.
Barry McKenzie was taken out of
Australia early in April under a false
name with Mrs Judy McLean, who was
secretary to Eslanda at one stage. Mrs
McLean's worried mother, Mrs Maude
Quinn, says that the last she heard came
in a letter written on the railway station
in Belgrade. Her daughter and Mrs
Smith, with the boys, were about to leave
Yugoslavia for East Germany.
From there they would meet up with
Mrs Heisler, and go on together to
Russia. Appeals have been made to the
Minister for Immigration, Mr H. Opper-
man.
UNIONS
Why the Reds Won the AEU
Was the National Civic Council disillusioned?
FROM A SYDNEY CORRESPONDENT
TPhe Communist Party had its most
outstanding victory for many
months in the recent ballot for the
Sydney-Newcastle division of the three-
man, controlling Commonwealth Coun-
cil of the Amalgamated Engineering
Union—a union, which with 80,000
members, is the biggest union affiliated
with the Australian Council of Trade
Unions. Mr R. Bruggy, a “left-wing”
member of the ALP, defeated Mr Colin
Shearer, whose election three years ago,
when he defeated a Communist Party
member, was hailed as the greatest
breakthrough since Mr Laurie Short won
the General Secretary's position of the
Federal Ironworkers’ Association in the
19505.
What went wrong? The ballot was a
small one and the official results (Bruggy,
4530; Burke, 2547; Shearer, 765) show
that far less than half of the 22,000
eligible voters voted. This, however, is
not sufficient to explain the voting pat-
tern.
Mr Bruggy was supported by the
so-called militant ALP members (G.
Garland, General Secretary, and A. E.
Horsburgh, Chairman), and he had the
organisational support of the Commu-
nist Party which, in this union, is parti-
cularly strong.
His opponent, Mr J. Burke, a former
Commonwealth Councillor and a mem-
ber who has stood for many union
positions, had the organisational support
of Mr Santamaria’s National Civic
Council. Shearer, the defeated candi-
date, was on his own.
No-one gave Burke, who is a member
of the ALP, any chance of beating
Bruggy, and the question is why did
the National Civic Council, in effect,
hand control of this important union
back to the Communist Party by with-
drawing its support from Shearer in
favor of Burke?
Over the last few years the NCC has
spent countless hours of labor and some
thousands of pounds on candidates for
positions in this union. But its sup-
porters say that the return for this ex-
penditure of effort has not been justi-
fied by the results. They point out that
the union is still manipulated by the
Communist Party; that union members,
who are in the Labor Party, still push
in the ALP the stock Communist pro-
paganda phrases they learn in the union;
that any number of Communist Party
front journals can still be picked up in
the offices of the AEU or distributed
through union channels. All this con-
tinued—so it is argued with some justi-
fication—despite the fact that Shearer
and the third member of the Common-
wealth Council, Mr J. McDowell, had
majority control and were both anti-
Communist. The NCC in other words
was disillusioned in Shearer.

For years no one —*- ourselves ex-

for the Princes Highway. But nowi
see this was the headline in the
RACY Journal:
"Big Improvement to

It comes as rather a shock that some-
body (perhaps the CRB or the
DMR)* has finally persuaded these
unimpressionable publishers of high-
way news that the Princes Highway
has been “tamed”, that “hundreds of
miles of corrugations . . . dangerous
curves have all but disappeared . . .
that poor conditions are encountered
only on a very few days in the year
and should in no way deter motorists
wanting to use the highway”.
So if you are

Why We Expand Less
Than Japan
Trade v. Treasury again
FROM J. C. HORSFALL IN MELBOURNE
A. J. FORBES
“Cosseting”
It was a nice coincidence last week in
Melbourne to find on the same
morning the Minister for Trade, Mr J.
McEwen, opening the Annual Confer-
ence of the Victorian Dairyfarmers’
Association at the Assembly Hall, while
at Melbourne University Dr A. J.
Forbes, as Minister assisting the Trea-
sury, was telling the Annual Convention
of the Australian National Economics
and Commerce Students’ Association that
the cosseting of inefficient industries
was holding back the rate of Australia’s
growth. When he said that, unfortu-
nately, community circumstances neces-
sitated so much inefficient industry,
Dr Forbes was sailing pretty close to the
contentious winds of conflict between
the Treasury and Trade departments.
Talking from what was obviously a
prepared Treasury brief, Dr Forbes was
at pains to stress that, in its recom-
mendation of protection for industries
the Tariff Board did a good job in sort-
ing out the wheat from the chaff in
industry, but his straight references from
the brief, and even more his more
homely obiter dicta, left nobody in doubt
about the Treasury’s concern that wide
ranging tariff protection of weaker in-
dustries militates against a higher growth
rate. This is not something Dr Forbes
need be timid about. Uneconomic pro-
tection has long been our soft underbelly.
Getting back to the Tariff Board, Sir
lames Kirby, Chairman of the Manu-
facturing Industries’ Advisory Council
(whom the students persuaded to open
the Convention and give the business-
men's viewpoint on growth) could hardly
do otherwise than say that, generally
speaking, manufacturers have no quarrel
With it even if particular industries who
have not been so well looked after
might. His main demurrer was on the
score of delay in making recommenda-
tions, but surely the Tariff Board is now
Performing miracles in getting through
a monumental amount of work.
Completing the trilogy of viewpoints
the best contribution to the Convention
came from Professor H. F. Lydall,
Professor of Economics at Adelaide
University. Fie revealed that the latest
studies in the United States showed that
a hout half of the 3 per cent average
annual increase in the growth rate there
from 1927-57 could be attributed to
increased labor efficiency and numbers,
only one-sixth to investment in capital
equipment and one-third to advances in
knowledge and techniques and econo-
mies of scale. The reasons we were not
approaching the growth rates of Western
Germany and Japan were mainly labor
shortages and inadequate expenditure
on education, indifferent entrepreneur-
ship and failure to decentralise.
PRESS
Does Thomson
Seek “Truth”?
£2,000,000 to spend
FROM RON TAYLOR IN NEW ZEALAND
spectre of Lord Thomson still
A haunts the New Zealand Newspapers
Proprietors’ Association and its mem-
bers. Since the battle for ownership of
the Wellington morning newspaper,
“The Dominion”, mention of Thom-
son’s name has been anathema to the
NPA. For when Thomson was finally
beaten off earlier this year, partly
through the threat of Government legis-
lation against him, his chief executive
Hugh Begg hinted that it was not the
end.
Consequently when a rumor circulated
last week that Thomson was again in
the field bidding for the Wellington-
based weekly, “New Zealand Truth”,
the NPA was thrown into another flurry.
With a 250,000 national circulation, the
former Ezra Norton-owned “Truth” is
by far the largest paper in the country.
Somewhat diffidently NPA emissaries
approached craggy J. H. (Jimmy) Dunn,
“Truth” chairman of directors, to ask if
there was any foundation to what they
had heard.
Dunn, a shrewd lawyer who fights
“Truth’s” legal battles in the Courts,
momentarily kept the NPA guessing.
He said he could not confirm that
Thomson was after “Truth”. Then, to a
further question whether he would deny
it, he said: “I’ve never heard of it.”
It was a much relieved NPA which
crept quietly back into its shell. But
where there is smoke there is fire. Thom-
son is known to be annoyed at the
thwarting of his attempts to get into
the newspaper business in the smallest
country he has yet taken an interest
in. And sources close to “Truth” re-
ported that Thomson has up to £2
million to spend on a newspaper some-
where in New Zealand.


Not a Leaf Out of Place
Bringing up Duntroon’s cadets
By AINSLIE
Duntroon from a high vantage point
looks exquisite, like a display
model on show at the local
Mechanics’ Institute. There are the white
box-like buildings with their tiled roofs
around the parade ground; there are no
stray cigarette butts, not a leaf out of
place and everything is painted, polished,
pruned and cleaned. Even the shrubs
and hedges get their regulation Army
haircuts, every 10 days.
The place to see, of course, is Dun-
troon House, built in stages between
1820 and 1860. This is a lovely old
building. It was the homestead of the
pioneer Robert Campbell, who owned
most of the land thereabouts across to
the mountain ranges. The garden, too,
is beautifully intact, much as the Camp-
bells left it, except for one thing. There
used to be a splendid replica of the
Hampton Court maze.
This was destroyed under the instruc-
tions of the Commandant some years ago
■—an incredible act of vandalism. The
story goes that the Commandant feared
that cadets were conducting nefarious
acts with young ladies under the shelter
of the bushes. However, there is talk
now of planting the maze anew.
The pride of the garden is a 103-year-
old oak, now glorious in autumn colors,
which spreads its branches over the
homestead. It carries a plaque which
says that it commemorates the birth of
Frederic Arthur Campbell at Campbell’s
Wharf on March 13, 1861. The birth
of a Campbell in those days was a
matter of some importance.
The Officers’ Mess is inside and it
would be, surely, among the most charm-
mg in Australia. There are some rugged
features. The Waterloo pictures in the
dining-room seem a little bloodthirsty
for one to face at breakfast. There’s
the ferocious tiger presented by General
Cariappa, High Commissioner for India,
in the main lounge-room. Then there’s
the famous oil of Robert Campbell him-
self.
He looks down with such an air of
disdain that he used to make officers
feel uncomfortable at parties. So he
was reduced in rank from the favored
position over the fireplace to a minor
spot in the dark far corner and he was
replaced by Major-General Sir William
Throsby Bridges, KCB, CMG, who
founded the Royal Military College in
1911 and died by a sniper’s bullet at
Gallipoli.
The present Commandant is Major-
General C. H. Finlay, CBE, an old
cavalryman, who served with the 6th,
7th and 9th Divisions in the Western
Desert and Syria during the Second
World War. It is still considered a rather
nice appointment for a General officer
and in recent times two Commandants
have gone on to be Chief of the General
Staff, Sir Henry Wells and Sir John
Wilton.
The next man in the chain of com-
mand is Colonel G. D. Solomons, whose
recent appointments have been Military
Attache in Washington and Army Secre-
tary- He has, perhaps, the most attrac-
tive title in the Army, Director of
Military Art.
Over the years life hasn’t changed
all that much at the Royal Military
College. Yet there are some differences.
In the old days even if you saw an,
officer in the dim distance across the!
parade ground you had to stiffen your-
self like a telegraph pole and throw a
salute. Officers used to suffer. Nov,
you might get away with it for distance;
over 30 yards.
Now there is leave into Canberra
every weekend. General Finlay (cadet
year 1929) recalls that in his day there
was no leave into Canberra without a
written invitation from a reputable Can-
berra family, and there was precious
little chance of getting it unless that
family was known to the CO.
But, of course, at that time there was
cavalry training and there was the com-
pensation of horses available for recrea-
tion riding. There were paper-chases on
horseback and it was rather wonderful
to ride out six or seven miles and meet
some girls at a prearranged spot for a
picnic.
He feels that the RMC cadet is not
quite as socially desirable as he used
to be. After all, Canberra has g rO ' VD
immensely, but among the young ladies
the Duntroon cadet still tends to he
looked upon as very good property. j D
the marriage stakes he rates highly-
For example, there is always the girl vv ™
looks upon a graduate as her one hope

Few areas in Australia can match the natural beauty of Mackellar County...the
‘playground of the South Pacific’. More and more tourists are being attracted to
this area... 30,000 last year. What attracts them? In Mackellar County there are
miles and miles of navigable waterways...twenty-one of the finest ocean beaches...
country clubs...marinas...and, in Pittwater, sheltered sailing for all types of boats.
Millions of pounds have been spent on hotels, motels and recreational facilities in
the area...yet the investment potential has hardly been tapped. Mackellar County
is the most vital, exciting area in Australia. No other area can offer such oppor-
tunities for both tourist and industrial development, side by side.
Mackellar County encourages industrial investment.
The industrial areas are only ten miles from the heart of the
city, yet surrounded by unspoiled bushland. Careful inter-
relation of industrial and residential areas close to main
highways, public transport, schools and shopping centres
have put this county years ahead in area development
planning. Mackellar County provides an efficient system of
arterial high ways...plenty of space for growth and expansion
...pleasant surroundings for greater plant efficiency...estab-
lished residential areas for both executives and staff.

in their first year, up to £4 in the fourth
year and at graduation they walk out
with nigh on £4OO when, almost inevi-
tably, they buy a car. So the General
likes to point out that there’s barely
another institution in the world which
will give you a free education, look after
you physically, spiritually, mentally and
pay you at the same time.
Clothes are another change from the
old days. Now the cadets can wear civi-
lian clothes in their off hours. Before
the system was exactly as at Pentridge.
The cadet handed in his civilian clothes
upon entry and received them back on
leaving.
The discipline, however, is as tough
as it ever was, carried out on the old
Army theory of “how can you hand it
out if you have never received it?”
The first-year cadet, the Fourth Class,
is the lowest form of bacterial life at
Duntroon. He does the menial tasks.
He must never call a Third or Second
Class cadet by his Christian name. When
he is addressed by a senior cadet he must
stand at attention and rise at once when
a First Class cadet enters his room.
Deveille is at 6.15 a.m. and within
one minute the cadet must have his
bed stripped and be standing outside his
room for inspection. Then has has a
chance to tidy his room.
His blankets and sheets must be folded
and placed in precisely the correct style.
All his shelves are numbered. There
is a regulation position for every shirt,
singlet, underpants, even handkerchiefs,
and they must be in exact rectangular
piles. His boots, in their correct posi-
tion, must shine like the sun, and all his
uniforms, correctly buttoned, must be in
their correct regulation position in the
wardrobe. Braces must not be left on
trousers, there’s a correct hanging place
for braces. Books on his shelves, too,
must be in their correct order of ascen-
dancy, as if they were lined up with a
theodolite.
A lightning raid could come at any
time and the invading officer might run
his finger along the top of the door to
find a speck of dust, or pick on a dirty
cricket boot. Every item of kit must
be there at all times. A man would be
m trouble even if a regulation piece of
cotton was missing from his sewing kit
or “housewife.”
Naturally cadets of all classes are
Well-organised against this. When the
cadets suddenly start scraping their
fioots as they walk up the passage, if
somebody calls out “Anybody got a
fifoom? or the hot water starts clinking
under blows from a bayonet you can
fiet your shining boots that there is an
officer in the block.

4.15 p.m. The sentence is half an hour
and a cadet has time to ponder his
faults as he sweats under his marching
kit, pack, rifle, ammunition arid all.
Sometimes it is the custom when a cadet
is landed with his first pack drill to hide
an alarm clock in his pack, place it close
to the tin hat, and set it for precisely
6.20 a.m.
So when he is out there standing rigid
in front of the Drill Sergeant, suddenly
that alarm clock goes off like the wrath
of all departed generals.
All this probably sounds more agoni-
sing than it really is. The system is the
same at most military colleges. It is
at least seven years since the cadets
held any initiation ceremonies. Captain
Paul Greenhalgh, the Adjutant, remem-
bers that his initiation consisted of a
long run around the hills, then he was
forced to crawl through a pigsty with the
mucky climax of having his face pushed
into a tub of pig slush, once for every
letter of his name.
It was one time when he wished his
ancestors had been rather briefer in the
choice of a name, something like Cox.
But that’s all gone. The academic work
is now so heavy that much of the old
nonsense has had to go —there isn’t time.
Yet the cadet has to show considerable
mental agility. In the first six weeks
he is expected to know all the traditions
of the college, the splendid achieve-
ments of past graduates down to who
designed the Duntroon badge and the
exact inscription on Sir William Bridges’
grave in the Duntroon grounds.
A favorite question from senior cadets
is: “What is the height of the Duntroon
flagpole?” Answer: “The flagpole is
75ft. 61ins. allowing half an inch for
atmospheric variations and bird manure
on the top.”
Fourth Class cadets suffer what is
known as “bastardisation”. They have
to listen to the 6.45 a.m. news and they
may have to repeat this back at break-
fast, item by item. The big session comes
at dinner after they have finished eating.
It is then in the Mess that the First Class
men start their questions.
In the old days they would be asked
such things as the complete inscription
on a Worcestershire sauce bottle or the
Royal family tree complete from Queen
Victoria to Queen Elizabeth 11. Now
bastardisation is more practical; it deals
mostly with current affairs. A cadet will
be asked for the names of Federal
Cabinet or an up-to-the-minute run-down
on the political situation in Laos or Viet-
nam. If he doesn't know, he is told to
find out and bring his answers to the
next Mess.
The young man who comes in at \l\
is not left entirely without a friend in the
world. Each cadet has a “Lord and
Master'’ in Third Class who is expected
to instruct him on basic duties, but more
interesting is the “Father and Son”
system. For example, the lowliest staff
cadet w'ould be numbered, say, 2198.
The cadet who is 100 before him, 2098,
is his Father and 1998 is his “Grand-
father”.
Grandfather would be in First Class
and Father in Second or Third. The
pink-cheeked Fourth Class man can
treat these cadets as paternal friends. He
can go to them for advice and help.
Maybe Grandfather could even get
another overbearing First Class man off
his back. He wouldn't dare go so far
as to call them by their first names, but
he would call them Pop and Grandpop.
Sometimes the system works, sometimes
it doesn't, depending on the warmth of
the grandfatherly hearts.
Like boarding school, as time goes on
the junior cadets become progressively
more illustrious. The First Class men
have special privileges. They are allowed
to keep a car, but even more remarkable
they are allowed to run a bar.
The bar is a most recent innovation,
and the reasoning is that it is foolish to
send graduates out into the world with
no understanding of liquor. So there is
the Quarter Bar, an adjunct of Duntroon
House. It is open for one hour on Wed-
nesdays, one hour on Fridays and two
hours on Saturdays—beer only.
HHhen First Class provides nearly all the
junior ranks at RMC, except, of
course, for the traditional Drill Sergeant,
the RSM, WOl Tom Muggleton. He has
a voice like ground glass which on a
still day can be heard virtually to the
top of Mount Pleasant.
The senior cadet, responsible for
“good order and discipline”, is Senior
Under-Officer J. W. Redward, the Batta-
lion Sergeant-Major, and a New Zea-
lander.
Right back to 1911 it has been part of
the charter that New Zealand has an
allocation of up to 10 staff cadets at
RMC. They send two to Sandhurst.
However, the posting to RMC is much
more sought after by the New Zealan-
ders. It is a four-year course at RMC
as opposed to two years at Sandhurst.
Sandhurst does not give the same atten-
tion either to academic or military
studies. As one general put it: “Sand-
hurst produces a graduate of the most
exquisite manners and the most barba-
rous ignorance”.
But the New Zealanders like Duntroon
and they do well. As they tell you, very
quickly, four out of the past eight BSMs
have been New Zealanders and almost

Dogged research work by Australian scientists in the face
of much discouragement and many obstacles cleared the
way for the development of papermaking in Australia to its
present status as a leading Commonwealth industry.
Working in the 1920’s and 1930’s these scientists proved
that this continent’s tough native eucalypt hardwoods
could be pulped successfully an outstanding techno-
logical achievement of the between-war decades.

that A.P.M., Australian Paper Manufacturers Ltd.,

future profits and progress and accords research an
important place in its organization and activities. In

lenging problems extending all the way from forestry
through pulp and paper manufacturing to the qualities
of the company’s finished products. There are grad-
uates of many scientific disciplines such as chemistry,
engineering, physics, paper technology, forestry, and
metallurgy. Among these researchers are some who

invariably the BSM wins the Sword of
Honor. The other high award, the
Queen’s Medal, goes to the graduate
with the best military and academic
record.
In sport there is no rank and no class
distinction—here all the cadets are equal.
RMC has always shown an aggressive
attitude to sport and it literally assaults
Canberra with a huge array of teams in
all codes, Rugby Union, Australian
Rules, soccer and hockey.
Rugby Union, though, is the star turn
and the college has an incredible record
for carrying off the Canberra grand final.
At Rugby finals they bring out ENO-
BESRA to cheer them on to victory.
(If you spell Enobesra backwards you
will understand.) The legend is that
after the 1914-18 War an ass returned
to Australia and for some unknown
reason was permitted to wander round
the college area. When the ass died, its
pelvic bone was mounted on the centre
of a pair of crossed boomerangs, sur-
mounting a special staff, along with
various bones and the college colors. So
now it comes out with great ceremony,
borne by cadets decked out in old
striped college blazers and caps. Old
ENOBESRA helps a great deal.
T>ut those who try to assess the value of
Duntroon immediately think of edu-
cation, and a comparison with the Officer
Cadet School at Portsea is irresistible.
OCS takes the officer candidate who has
come to his decision often later in life.
Maybe he has missed out on Law at the
university, maybe he is sick of his dull
bank job, or maybe he is seeking promo-
tion out of the Regular Army. Whatever
the reason, he goes to Portsea and after
a year he graduates as a Second Lieuten-
ant.
To get his second pip he must behave
himself, get his Leaving Certificate and
wait up to three years. Now OCS
started in 1951 and many of the first
graduates are now rising Majors in the
Army. It is generally agreed that Port-
sea is turning out very good officers and
it is not always easy to see the difference
between the Seasiders and the Duntroon-
ers. So the sly argument comes in, that
if Duntroon eased up on the academics
it could turn out four times as many
officers, badly needed right now, and
those officers probably would be better
informed in military matters than young
gentlemen stuffed with the liberal arts
which probably destroyed their efficiency
as soldiers anyhow.
That last point, particularly, is the
one that strikes a tender spot at Dun-
troon. Major-General Finlay says that
if your object is merely to turn out a ’
fighting infantry soldier, if that’s your
be all and end all, it is perfectly true that
the education is a waste of time. But
now we are reaching the stage where
the successful man in every field must
have a university education.
So instead of the Royal Military Col-
lege easing up on the academics it is
going the other way. Until now the
four-year course has been roughly the
equivalent of two years Army and two
years university. The Duntroon engi-
neering graduate, for example, can go
into third-year engineering at the uni-
versity or he can get up to six credits
on an Arts course.
At RMC there are seven professors
and the Dean is the very dedicated Pro-
fessor T. A. Sutherland, OBE, MA, BSc.
He has been associated with the school,
except for a break during the depression,
since 1929.
The academic studies this year have
been increased by 60 per cent with the
object of giving all courses at Duntroon
degree status. They can do this because
the student works a long academic year
of 43 weeks starting January 26-31 and
graduating on the second Tuesday in
December. There's a certain shyness in
talking about the possibility of granting
degrees at RMC, because it has yet to be
blessed by Government legislation.
All this, of course, entails a necessary
reduction in military training. One time,
even by the end of first year, a cadet
had a basic knowledge of practically
all military weapons in the Army; not
so any more.
Under the new system, actual military
training couldn't account for more than
40 per cent of the course. The Director
of Military Art, Colonel Solomons, and
a most sophisticated Army officer, says,
like Churchill, that he doesn’t propose
to preside over the destruction of his
empire. He insists that the cadets still
get a basic training in all specialised
branches of the Army and they go out
equipped either to become platoon com-
manders in the infantry or troop com-
anders in artillery or armor.
He points out, too, that the academic
courses all have a military bias and that
the RMC soon will have Australia’s first
Chair of Military History.
The degree course does solve an old
Army problem. The Major who goes out
at 47 now will have a university degree.
But the outsider looking in can hardly
fail to get the impression that the
pressure is on these cadets, perhaps in
a more testing manner than on any
other students in the country.
Major-General Finlay says every year
there is an average of two who simply
can't stand the life. They build up a
psychological wall and can’t go on.
Others mostly fail for academic reasons.
The 1961 course which graduates this
year has a higher failure rate than
normal and has shrunk from 71 to 41.
This year’s course started at 80 and is
now down to 75.
XTet with all the built-in agonies Dun-
A troon is still sought after. Not quite
as much as it was in the ’thirties, but
even so there were 600 applications this
year for the 80-odd positions. There has
been some shift in emphasis away from
the public schools, so that there is a far
greater percentage of boys from the
High Schools and Technical Schools.
The Commandant says that this year
they have a cadet whose father is a
truck-driver and mother a barmaid, and
a very good cadet he is, too.
Undoubtedly it is a life that requires
a certain amount of dedication and at
the college you notice how everything
is geared to the ultimate goal. In the
cadet's Mess there is a board which lists
the number of days to go to graduation.
When 200 days to go appears on the
board there's a ceremony in the Mess
at dinner when the students pound the
table with their spoons. The same thing
happens on 100 days to go, and this is
the day when Fourth Class is tradition-
ally allowed to make a raid on First
Class, their peers.
Then with 40 days to go this is the
signal that Fourth Class, glory be, has
the privilege of growing moustaches.
But the pass-out parade and graduation
is a moving event in a cadet’s life.
Tradition dictates that the cadet's girl-
friend pins the pips to one shoulder and
his mother places the pips on the other
shoulder. At the graduation ball, mother
gets the first dance and the girlfriend
the second.
Next there are wild celebrations, any-
thing from blowing up chairs on the
parade ground to removing the old 18-
pounders from the Gun Gate.
The next step for many of the
graduates is to hurry off and get married,
although the Army does not look upon
this with much enthusiasm. As in the
Church, it helps administration if you
can keep some of your junior officers
celibate.

OUT AND ABOUT
Songs of Social Significance
The serious world of Peter, Paul and Mary
By CHARLES SRIBER
No one could possibly have believed
even a year ago that a folk song
trio could produce a Sydney Sta-
dium sell-out days before the artists
arrived from the United States. The
artists to confound these sceptics are
three young singers who have been
penetrating our pop charts for some
time mow. Peter, Paul and Mary are
in Australia on what is only their third
overseas trip.
Each was ready to admit that suc-
cess has been golden for them and, as
Peter put it, “We’ve come to love all
that money”. But they are insistent that
it is being earned with no compromise
with commercial blandishments, and the
accolades that have followed them only
confirm their determination to sing the
kind of songs they believe in.
While they began singing together in
the smoky confines of New York’s
Greenwich Village, the trio take their
social stand seriously enough to partici-
pate in marches and other demonstra-
tions against segregation.
Tallest of the two male singers, is Paul
Stookey, slim and urbane in his much
publicised Brooks Brothers’ suit with
matching vest. He was adamant that the
folk song upsurge was commensurate
with the drive against white supremacy.
“All our songs have a message of some
kind,” he said.
“You see the young people simply
don’t share this feeling against the
Negroes. ‘Ole Miss’ was an example. The
students were happy enough to accept
integration; it was the outside elements
and the older people that led the fight
against it.” Did he see any sign that
things were changing?
“Most definitely. More and more
youngsters are telling the older genera-
tion that a man's ethnic origin doesn’t
matter a damn. Of course you get
groups that don’t see it so clearly. We’ve
been confronted with these and we've
spoken to them, asked them whether
they really believe in their hearts that
there is such a difference between people
of different pigmentation, and they’ve
had to agree that it doesn't go very
deep.”
Does he think songs are an effective
way of getting this message across?
“Most definitely. It isn’t only the songs—
anybody can sing songs. But people
are moved to come and ask us ‘Do
you really believe what you sing about?’
And we tell them we certainly do. Mary
began in the days of the old Almanac
Singers.”
I remembered the group who sang
across the United States in the turbulent
days of the birth of industrial unionism
when beetle-browed John L. Lewis was
using the miners’ organisation as the
foundation stone of the CIO.
I crossed the room to talk to this
statuesque blonde woman who has the
eyes of a Siamese cat and the wide, easy
mouth of a person who gets a great deal
of enjoyment out of living. “Sure,” she
said, “I sang with the old Almanac group.
I wasn't old enough to be with them in
their heyday. But I filled in on one of
their discs.”
Originally from Louisville, Kentucky,
Mary moved to New York and came
to the group via Paul who helped her
back into the limelight after a disastrous
Broadway flop with Mort Sahl called
“The Next President”.
The rise of the group was carefully
planned. For seven months they worked
in what they termed “the crucible”,
perfecting their songs and the vigorous
style that has given them sell-out per-
formances in halls, night-clubs and
theatres as well as on college campuses
throughout the United States.
Third member of the group is equally
slim Peter Yarrow. “Each one of us
has a different approach to life. Mary
is married and tied up with her family.
Paul married eight months ago and is
pretty much wrapped up in his wife
Elizabeth. I’m single; no plans in that
direction yet. This difference between
up helps in our interpretation.”
Grey-haired, stocky A 1 Grossman is
travelling with the group. Slow-spoken,
with no evidence of the drive that went
into the organisation of the three as a
group, he was certain that singers of
folk songs and songs of social signifi-
cance loomed very big in the current
US entertainment field.
This success has been reflected in the
local scene. General sales manager of
the Australian Record Company, Ray
Bull, said the Warner Brothers label,
under which the group records exclu-
sively, had risen into the best-selling
category. Leading the field was their
45 “Tell It On the Mountain” which
was well established on the Hit Parade.
But it may be doubted whether every-
one in Sydney is in step. At the height
of their Sydney reception, held in
Romano’s restaurant, a middle-aged man
strayed in. “I’m sorry sir,” he was told,
“Peter, Paul and Mary are in here.”
He eyed the waiter indignantly. “I
came down here for dinner. I didn't
come to hear something out of the
Bible.”

One Man’s D-Day
“The incredible green
of Normandy’s fields "
By DAVID McNICOLL
The other day I heard someone say,
“Twenty years since D-Day”.
That started me thinking about it,
trying to remember details, many of
which had faded into a sort of war haze
which, I suppose, for some people
envelops the whole of memory about a
series of exciting and boring times
spread over five years.
But I suddenly found I could re-
member one thing more than any other
—the incredible green of the Normandy
fields beyond the beach when the light
grew stronger on the morning of June 6,
1944. And I can remember thinking to
myself: “This is a hell of a way to visit
France for the first time in your life.”
I was a war correspondent on D-Day,
and a somewhat frightened war corres-
pondent, too. In the Army, my war in
Palestine, Cyprus, Syria and Darwin had
been remarkably devoid of danger, by
no means a displeasing feature. But
now, here I was, released from the
Army, my pistol exchanged for a
Corona portable, and surrounded by
more noise, semi - organised confusion
and danger than I had believed possible.
It had all started very quietly, too.
We knew the invasion would be on
soon, but we didn’t know when. There
had been a couple of frustrating
“dummy runs” for the Press corps,
designed to keep them from brooding
and asking questions, and perhaps also
to throw off the scent the German spies
who, we understood, kept a good watch
on correspondents hanging round
London.
Then one day we were told to pack
our bags, and bring a cut lunch round
to the Admiralty. The Savoy provided
me with four Duchess-type sandwiches,
containing wafer-thin smoked salmon—
undoubtedly the daintiest fare ever
taken by anyone to war.
At the Admiralty I was handed a stiff
piece of pasteboard which read, “It is
requested that Mr D. R. McNicoll, of
Australian Consolidated Press, may be
permitted to visit HMS Hilary as a rep-
resentative of the Press during the
assault.” Then came our briefing,
delivered by a Naval captain, as the
sea lords of the past gazed down on us
from the panelled walls.
Finally, the briefing was over. The
captain said: “Gentlemen, what Philip
of Spain failed to do, what Napoleon
tried and failed to do, what Hitler never
had the courage to do, we are about to
do, and with God’s grace, we shall.”

Cut down
saturated
fats in
your daily
diet
Many doctors believe that choles-
terol is one of several factors
having a strong connection with
serious ailments. The more choles-
terol in the blood, the greater
the apparent risk. The amount of
cholesterol in the blood depends
on not only the amount but also
the type of fat in the daily diet.
Saturated fats (the kinds found
in dripping and butter) raise the
level of cholesterol. Poly-unsatur-
ated fats can reduce the level.
What are poly-unsaturated fats?
These fats are most commonly
derived from vegetable sources,
particularly Satflower oil, yielding
a very high content of poly-
unsaturates, a most important one
being linoleic.
What is “Miracle”? A new table
margarine made from Safflower
Oil, rich in poly-unsaturates.
“Miracle” contains cholesterol-
reducing linoleic to help you
balance the fats in your diet.
“Miracle” has a natural flavour
that all the family likes!

I’ve often wondered if Churchill wrote
it for him.
My ship was HMS Hilary, head-
quarters ship for the JUNO beach
operation; a converted banana boat,
Captain Paget, RN, in command. He
carried the 3rd Canadian divisional
headquarters and many of the divisional
troops. We boarded Hilary in the after-
noon under the lee of the Isle of Wight
and waited for darkness. My cabin com-
panion was a tall, drawling and rather
magnificent Englishman named Michael
Standing, representing the BBC. We
humped our great haversacks into the
cabin, then started sorting out our gear
duffle coats, stockings, flash masks,
seaboots, steel helmets, respirators. Then
we went off to report to the captain, to
meet the Canadian Army commanders,
and to sit down to a five-course meal for
which my stomach, after its four dainty
Savoy sandwiches, was ready.
The night passed no movement.
Then the word went round —there was
a postponement. The bottles gurgled in
the bar, the gin flowed, the tension was
off for 24 hours.
move to Normandy, when it came,
A was eerie in its quietness. We
knew ships were stretched astern of us,
but could see nothing. The screw of our
old banana boat throbbed as it pushed
us on and on through the line of red-
dan lights which stretched right across
the Channel to our destination Juno
Beach. The wind was cold, and there
were occasional scuds of rain, and
Standing and I put on our duffle coats
and our tin hats and peered out into the
darkness towards France where now we
could see the occasional flash of high
explosive as bombers started the soften-
ing up of the beach defences.
As we got closer in the noise in-
creased, and the flashes grew clearer.
Now the roar of high-flying aircraft
was almost continuous, and looking up
at the skies it was hard not to think—
and shudder in sympathy—of the face-
darkened paratroops who were at the
moment dropping from the skies into
the deadly flak which we knew would
greet them in the Cotentin peninsula.
As the din increased, and because I
could hear things landing on the ship,
we moved under a metal stairway run-
ning to the bridge. Down the stair over
my head came the clop-clop of a sailor's
boots as he rattled down with a message
for some one below. As he spun round
to dive inside he sighted us under the
stairs. “Noisy, ain't it?’’ he said, and
disappeared.
And noisy it was, Hilary had stopped
and anchored, and boats for the shore
were getting away. The light was in-
creasing and the white outline of the
beach came up first. Then more light,

and suddenly, dramatically, unbeliev-
ably, we could see the armada stretched
on either side of us.
As I write of it now, it starts to come
back in the camera of my memory
the scores of ships strung along the
coast, ships of every size and shape,
some belching flame, others spewing out
landing craft and floating tanks.
Along the beach were strung the
savage steel defences, some visible, some
half - submerged, and here and there
through binoculars I could see a frog-
man at work on his hellish job of de-
lousing the mines which were stuck on
the metal “toothpicks” in the sea. Up
the beach to the shattered little town
of Berniers-Sur-Mer went boatload after
boatload of Canadians, up the beach and
out of sight, some behind the crankling,
gangling tanks, some unprotected by
armor.
And behind it all were the fields
the green, green summer fields of
Normandy, with occasional scars, but
still green. The light was strong now,
and the first wounded were coming
aboard. A young Canadian, his throat
partly shot away, was carried into
Hilary’s dining saloon which had been
cleared as a casualty clearing station.
His gasping, gargling, breathing seemed
to come clear above the noise of guns,
as he was laid on a dining table and a
doctor started to operate. Then, a few
moments later, the gasping breathing
stopped, and the young Canadian who
would never see his homeland again
was carried to one side of the dining
saloon, wrapped in a sheet.
At 11 a.m. Standing and I got ashore,
The littered ghastly shore, with the
debris of death everywhere. Some bodies
half-floating in the lapping waves, aban-
doned equipment on the shoreline,
tattered books a German bible among
them water-bottles, guns, iron rations.
The shattered pillboxes reeked of
cordite, and dead Germans hung from
the embrasures as though blown out
from inside. Four French civilians
appeared from one of the poppy-strewn
fields and sauntered along the beach,
picking over the abandoned trash of
war. At the top of a ridge a working’
party was digging a huge hole, about
thirty feet long and twenty feet wide.
1 did not have to wonder long what it
was for. More men were stacking i
bodies—dozens of dead Canadians, laid
out side by side, their equipment still
on them; in another part, the German
dead were being collected.
The day wore on. Now the reports
and the rumors were flying. The
Americans had been annihilated all
Omaha Beach; the paratroop landings
had failed; the Germans were massing
for a counter-attack. The half-truths, the
scraps of news with small germs of
veracity, which are part and parcel of
wartime operations. When w'e put off
to Hilary at dusk, as a few foolhardy
German bombers came screaming down
on the invasion fleet, we were able to
sort out truth from conjecture. For
there was the staid, implacable Captain
Paget with his courteous “Good even-
ing, gentlemen. How were things
ashore?”, and then he would lean over
his maps and tell us how the worlds
biggest combined operation was faring.
Inside his cabin, a whisky in our
hands, the noise could hardly be heard.
It seemed impossible that only two or
three miles away men were locked in
a bloody armored struggle, the start of
the beginning of the end.
Then there was a crumping, jarring,
sickening explosion in the sea near us,
and the old Hilary seemed to shake from
her bilges to her bridge. It was a near-
miss bomb, but close enough to send the
engineers scuttling to see if any damage
was done below.
We turned in early. Tomorrow was
another day. The day we had just lived
would be known in history as D-Day.

How De Gaulle Did It
One object Great Power status for France
From WILLIAM MILLINSHIP in London
Six years ago, at Whitsun, 1958,
General de Gaulle reappeared as
the savior of France. Since then
he has made himself dramatically felt
in various parts of the world.
This year his international freeboot-
ing has reached a new climax; he has
recognised Communist China, planned
to tour the whole of South America,
undermined Nato, and persistently re-
fused to follow the American lead any-
where in the world.
He has had one consistent object:
Great Power status for France. And he
has had a consistent view of world
politics: the belief that the nation-State
is still the essential basis of action, that
national interests are more important
and more enduring than ideologies. It
1S a nineteenth-century view. It tempers
Ihe ideological fanaticism of the
twentieth century, but does nothing to
advance a solution of its biggest prob-
lems.
To achieve his end he has been pre-
pared to make friends with anyone, to
Sample on sentiments, to brush aside
Geological differences, and to manoeuvre
w, th ruthlessness and speed and without
commitment—the opposite of Britain’s
tactics.
He represents no new idea of how
to conduct politics; he is not a Euro-
Pean unity man or a white-civilisation
n ian. Unlike Jean Monnet, who helped
to make France rich and conceived the
Common Market, he does not have con-
structive ideas. The only thing he is
for is France having more say. Whether
he does it by ganging-up with the Anglo-
Saxons, the Germans, the Russians, the
Afro-Asians or the Chinese is a detail.
He came from the political generation
of Franco, Hitler, Mussolini and Salazar,
who reacted against the parliamentary
democracy and internationalism in vogue
immediately after the First World War.
Like them he represents the idea of the
nation-State embodied in a single in-
dividual the old monarchical idea
adapted to modern times by Napoleon.
When de Gaulle returned to power in
1958, after 12 years in the desert,
France was in a mess. Its political
system was collapsing under the weight
of colonial problems—first Indo-China,
then Algeria. The country was drifting
towards civil war, living on foreign
loans, and looked incapable of fulfilling
its obligations in the Common Market.
France had become a joke to the rest
of the world.
De Gaulle at once began playing with
designs for greatness. His immediate
preoccupations were at home the
Army, the franc and the foundations of
his political power. The Algerian war
severely restricted his freedom of action
abroad. France was a weak ally, an
obvious target for Communist propa-
ganda, and the colonial Power in the
eyes of the under-developed world.
But de Gaulle had learned during
the wartime years in London how to
attack from a position of extreme weak-
ness. He resolved to behave like a world
Power, even if he wasn’t one. He began
by conquering his own Foreign Office,
the Quai d’Orsay. He installed a brilliant
but loyal professional diplomat, Couve
de Murville, as Foreign Minister, who
has since run the Ministry (as one
diplomat complained) “like an embassy”.
De Gaulle decided that diplomacy was
too serious to be left to diplomats; he
left the professionals to provide the
machinery and the smoke-screens, while
he prepared his secret salvoes.
His first major move was characteris-
tically bold. In a memorandum to Eisen-
hower and Macmillan written on Septem-
ber 17, 1958, he staked out France’s
claim to be a world Power. He proposed
that France, America and Britain should
form a new club or “Directorate” to
look after the world interests of the
West, and to take joint decisions on
strategy, including nuclear problems. He
implied, though he did not demand,
that France should have a veto over the
use of American nuclear power.
The British and the Americans dis-
cussed the proposal with the French in
the following 12 months. But de Gaulle
must have realised that a commitment
of this kind would be unacceptable to
Congress, even if President Eisenhower
could be won over. The memorandum

may, in fact, have been an excuse for
de Gaulle’s future attacks on Nato
an organisation which is in complete
contradiction with his fundamental belief
that defence is a national problem.
While the memorandum was still
under discussion he began to make dif-
ficulties within Nato. He refused to
allow American nuclear stockpiles on
French territory, and withdrew his
Mediterranean fleet from Nato com-
mand.
Far from fearing the effect of all this
on his European neighbors, he seems to
have deliberately set them worrying. He
gave a copy of his memorandum to
M. Spaak, then Secretary-General of
Nato, while one of his ministers alerted
the Germans and Italians.
He gave them more to worry about
when he appeared to veer Eastwards.
At his Press conference in November,
1959, he recalled that Russia was a
“white European nation” with “the
yellow multitude which is China” on
its Asian doorstep. After Khrushchev’s
visit, and de Gaulle’s contemptuous re-
fusal to take Communism seriously,
people began talking about a Paris-Mos-
cow axis, just as later they talked about
a Paris-Bonn axis, a Paris-Peking axis,
or a Paris-Madrid axis.
His aim, as always, was to put France
in a position to prevent a new Russo-
American tete-a-tete, another Yalta, in
which the voice of France, that is of
de Gaulle, would not be heard.
If he had a grand design for achieving
this aim, it was best expressed in the
third volume of his memoirs, published
in November, 1959. There he said that
the States “bordering on the Rhine, the
Alps and the Pyrenees” should form a
political, economic and strategic group
which should become “one of the three
planetary Powers, and, if necessary one
day, the arbiter between the two Soviet
and Anglo-Saxon camps”.
The Franco. - German Treaty
Tt was in Europe that de Gaulle’s real
A hopes of leadership lay. When he came
to power in 1958, France had already
ratified (against Gaullist opposition) the
Treaty of Rome which established the
Common Market. De Gaulle honored
the treaty, but soon made it plain that
his idea of a future European Union
w'as quite different from that of the
federalists or integrationists in the Com-
mon Market.
The French diplomat Christian Fou-
chet prepared a plan for him, proposing
a loose union of sovereign States in
which governments, and not a Euro-
pean parliament or a supranational
bureaucracy, continued to make the real
decisions. The other five members of
the Common Market insisted that a door
be kept open for greater political inte-
gration. De Gaulle refused to make
concessions, and by April, 1962, the
“Fouchet plan” was officially declared
dead by all six Foreign Ministers.
De Gaulle then turned to the most
convenient and logical alternative a
Franco-German Alliance. In his eyes,
the reconciliation of France and Ger-
many was the core of the European
unity movement and the potential basis
of European power.
He found a willing partner in Dr
Adenauer, who saw the alliance as the
culmination of his life’s work. The old
Chancellor shared some of de GaulleV
suspicions of America and Britain. He
was afraid Britain wanted to come into
the Common Market to break it up. He
suspected Kennedy and Macmillan of
wanting to do a deal with Khrushchev j
at West Germany’s expense.
Adenauer’s hopes and fears blinded t
him to the realities of Germany’s de-
pendence on the US. He did not foresee
the anger in Washington when the new
Franco - German Treaty was signed,'
only a few days after de Gaulle’s famous
January Press conference last year, at j
which he vetoed Britain’s entry into the j
Common Market. For de Gaulle made
it clear that, in excluding Britain, he
was also trying to exclude America
from Europe. Britain’s great sin was not
simply that she was an island: she was,
above all, the chosen instrument of the
US destined to be the Anglo-Saxon
Trojan horse in Europe.
The implications of de Gaulle’s coup
were clearly seen in Washington. It
dealt a sledge-hammer blow to the
American grand design for an Atlantic!
Community. A coldly furious Kennedy*
began a counter-offensive intended to(
isolate de Gaulle in Europe.
The weaknesses of the Generals
Germany policy were quickly exposed.
The Germans, while flattered by their
new importance, took fright at havin'
to choose between France and America.
They tried to hold on to both suitors
De Gaulle’s triumphant visit to Germany
in September, 1962, was at least matched
by the tumultuous welcome given to/

made it clear that, if forced, they would,

her main interest of national reunifies 1
tion. Only America was strong enough/
to counter Russia and to bargain with'
her. I
Even the fact that Kennedy was look-
ing for agreements with Khrushchev y
did not throw the Germans into de
Gaulle’s arms. They took up the Arneri- \
can idea of a Nato mixed crew nuclear,
fleet, which the French had dismissed.!
They signed the nuclear test ban treaty |
negotiated by Russia, America and .
Britain, and rejected by de Gaulle, h
seemed as if the only result of the
Franco-German treaty was to hasten the
departure of Adenauer. De Gaulle
found that his European grand design i
had led to a stalemate.
But, in the meantime, the test ban
treaty and the rapprochement between
Kennedy and Khrushchev after Cuba
showed exciting prospects in the rest ot
the world. Nuclear war had become k ss
likely; the Cold War in its old form was
ending. Russia and America were draw-


ing closer, but (as de Gaulle had pre-
dicted) Russia and China were splitting
apart. The old blocs were breaking up,
and the scope for de Gaulle's freelance
diplomacy suddenly widened.
It had become safe to flout the Great
Powers and to flirt with the small. New
horizons were opening for leadership in
the “Third World” of neutralist and
developing countries. The end of the
Algerian war, his friendly relations with
Ben Bella (de Gaulle was invited to
Algiers before Khrushchev) and his in-
dependent attitude towards the US all
strengthened his hand.
His first move in this new role was
made in Asia. Typically, he chose an
area where France had once been the
ruling power, and where America was
now deep in trouble. On August 29,
1963, de Gaulle released a statement in
favor of an agreement to unify South
and North Vietnam as a neutral State.
It was an ironic change. Fewer than
10 years after the French defeat at Dien
Bien Phu, France was mediating in
Indo-China, and now it was the Ameri-
cans who were increasingly bogged down
in a hopeless war. (Ten years further
back still, it was de Gaulle’s own policy
of restoring French prestige in Indo-
China that had destroyed the prospects
of a settlement, and set off a war which
cost hundreds of thousands of lives.)
But what about China? France could
not have an active policy in Asia with-
out dealing with Peking. So last summer
de Gaulle prepared to recognise Com-
munist China. It was a new way of
proving to the “Third World” his in-
dependence from Washington. And
France and China, the two main
countries who rejected the test ban
treaty, had their nuclear ambitions in
common.
Keeping the world guessing
operation was staged with both
mystery and publicity. First, a team of
French businessmen toured Communist
China last September. Then, Edgar
Kaure, the brilliant former Premier,
having been briefed by de Gaulle, went
1° Peking on a pseudo-secret mission,
to sound out Mao Tse-tung and Chou
En-lai. It was typical of de Gaulle’s
technique of keeping the world guessing.
In the surrounding mystery, many
people, including Walter Lippmann, sus-
pected that de Gaulle was persuading
eking to accept a “Two Chinas”
policy, which would allow France to
continue recognising Formosa. But de
. au lle broke with Chiang Kai-shek and,
p front of a world audience, recognised
, In g- Ignoring his previous prophecies
aootit the Yellow Peril, he acclaimed
lna as a “great people” with “a
capacity for patience, labor and in-
dustry”.
De Gaulle now began to look to-
wards another continent, which offered
scope for his neo-neutralist diplomacy—
Latin America. He sent off a special
envoy, Jean Chauvel, former ambassador
in London, who, early in 1963, reported
that dependence on the United States
had created a feeling of claustrophobia
in the Latin American States. Chauvel
prescribed what his master wanted to
hear, a European initiative to relieve the
pressure.
Many Latin Americans looked to
Britain; but the British were unwilling
to offend Washington and preoccupied
with other continents. De Gaulle saw
an opening. He brought President Mateo
of Mexico to Paris on a State visit and
sent him home with a $l5O million loan.
His return visit to Mexico this year
was a colorful triumph. He spoke Span-
ish in Mexico City, recorded by hundreds
of special correspondents. This autumn,
if his health allows, he will spend a
month visiting the 10 States of South
America. His reputation there shows
his extraordinarily protean personality:
for while the Left wing in Paris tries
to paint him as a Right-wing autocrat,
in Cuba his defiance of America and
his diplomatic panache have made him
something of a rebel hero. But what he
can actually offer South America is little
beyond the satisfaction of snook-cock-
ing.
Where will the “rebel” strike next?
Probably at Nato again. The General
has made no attempt to disguise his
hostility to the Western defence system.
He regrets the system of integrated com-
mand as a hypocritical attempt to disguise
the fact of American domination. He
once told Macmillan: “We shall be in
Nato less and less.” The General may
indeed be waiting with his sledge-
hammer to wreck the whole edifice.
“Having settled all the great problems
of her past, France has today a freedom
of action that no other nation enjoys.”
So said de Gaulle’s Foreign Minister,
Couve de Murville, in Parliament last
month. On the face of it, the results
have been spectacular. De Gaulle has
succeeded in making France felt in
every continent. He has embarrassed
America, embraced China, humiliated
Britain, bewitched Latin America and
hypnotised Europe. Even Australia is
worried by the French H-bomb tests in
the Pacific.
But what exactly does it all add up
to? A great deal of the spectacle is pure
illusion. De Gaulle (as he did in war-
time London) has bluffed his way on to
the world stage. The realities of power
that he has sought the three-Power
Directorate, a French-led Europe, the
France-Germany alliance —have evaded
him. He has no fixed allegiance, and
without the sure support of America,
Germany or Russia, his role is severely
limited. He is constantly trying to live
and act beyond his political means.
Is he no more than a Walter Mitty
among statesmen? Obviously not; for
his achievement is not all illusion. By
seeming important, he has often become
important; and with his sense of history
and his gambler’s daring he has helped
to quicken the world's changes.
A substitute for glory
11/fucH of his activity has been dan-
gerous or mischievous. He has
played on nationalism, on the H-bomb,
on anti-Americanism. But he has also
faced up to new realities; and even in
his most infuriating postures he asks
questions (for instance about Vietnam)
which require thoughtful consideration.
His originality is that he disbelieves
in political ideas, like Communism. This
leads to useful neutralism in Laos
(though he is not for neutralism as such
in. the Middle East or in Berlin or any
other buffer areas); but it also leads to
him misjudging the possibility of being
politically related to both Peking and
Formosa (having misjudged this possi-
bility, he merely ignores the problem of
Formosa and produces no solution for
if at all).
His policies can be extraordinarily
confused, as in the Middle East, where
he tries to befriend both Israel and the
Arabs, without having any particular
idea of how to advance matters. He
merely offers his presence. He does not
show any understanding of nuclear
power and its probable effects on strategy
and international relations. He merely
uses it to promote French prestige.
As a semi-megalomaniac politician in
the nuclear age, he gives a half-taste of
what will happen if we go on advancing
technically without developing new
political methods of maintaining law and
order in the world. As an arch-opponent
of both the United Nations and the
Soviet-American balance of power, he
is against what embryonic world order
we have, without being in favor of any
alternative notion. He is really an old
anarchist, but more comic than tragic
because of Mine de Gaulle, who
symbolises his nice ordinariness behind
the bombast.
He has been most successful of all in
impressing the French. For them, he
has managed to produce, at a critical
stage in their history, a substitute for
military glory. The humiliation of Dien
Bien Phu and the loss of Algeria have
been forgotten in the excitement of this
great new diplomatic pageant, with the
name of France resounding through the
world, (ofns)

Japan’s Instant Religion
" Jesus Christ teas crucified. He was defeated ”
From S. T. BLACKALL in Japan
IN the last fortnight the Press has
carried brief reports of a visit to
Australia by Mr Daisaku Ikeda, the
president of the Japanese religious move-
ment Soka Gakkai (“Value Creating
Association”), whose members are fol-
lowers of an intolerant 13th-century
Buddhist monk called Nicheren. What
the president did there was not clear; all
that most inquirers were told was that
he was on an “inspection tour”.
The rise of this strange religious move-
ment in recent years has been nothing
less than phenomenal. At the end of
the Pacific War there was a religious
vacuum in defeated Japan. Immediately
new religions blossomed forth, some only
lasting a matter of months, others still
flourish today. By 1963 the number
had settled down to approximately 170,
of which all but 30 were based on one
of the three established religions of
Buddhism, Shinto, and Christianity.
Of all the new religions, however, the
Soka Gakkai is far and away the lar-
gest, with an estimated 10 million mem-
bers. Founded in 1930, it ceased to
function during the war years when the
handful of followers either deserted the
cause or were imprisoned. After the
war it started again with less than 100
members and it was not until the middle
1950 s that it really got moving. The
Soka Gakkai is now expanding at the
amazing rate of more than 100,000 new
members per month, and has thus be-
come the world's fastest-growing religion.
It has a tax-free income of nearly £4
million per year, a publishing house
which includes a weekly newspaper, a
public relations director, 15 members in
Parliament, and a vast ferro-concrete
headquarters at the foot of Mount Fuji.
Already a second building is nearing
completion, of such mammoth propor-
tions that will make the present structure
seem like a doll’s house in comparison.
Able to accommodate up to 5000 wor-
shippers, the new hall will best be re-
membered for the astonishing way in
which the money was raised to pay for
it. In July, 1961, a fund was opened
to raise the equivalent of £li million—
not in one year, not in two years, but
in the space of four days! More in-
credible still, the total contributions
amounted to no less than £44 million,
and this from a country where the
Trades Union Council has been trying
without success to establish a national
basic wage of £l2 per month.
Last summer overseas meetings were
held for the first time in Thailand,
Europe and the USA.
HThe actual doctrines of the Soka
A Gakkai are difficult to define. The
only authoritative writings on the subject
are contained in “An Essay on Value” by
the first president of the movement. It
seems to suggest a new religious philo-
sophy based on man’s own vitality and
not on abstract thought. The present
emphasis, however, seems to be that of
personal gain, coupled with the impor-
tance of the individual.
The form of worship is the recitation
of a short prayer before the Gohonzon,
which is a small scroll given to each be-
liever. By application the Gohonzon
itself is supposed to hold enormous
power and is usually kept in a place of
honor in the household.
Without doubt much of Soka Gakkai’s
success is due to its amazing organisa-
tion, which has a military flavor. Mem-
bership is on the family principle.
Fifteen families comprise a squad, six
squads form a company, ten companies
a district, and 30 districts make up a
regional area. Vast parades are held
at which the Soka Gakkai Youth Corps
is particularly prominent. In March,
1958, 200,000 people gathered to attend

the opening of the Grand Kodo or
meeting hall. One month later 300,000
people took part in the funeral proces-
sion for Mr Toda, the second president
of the association, at which, although
not a member, the then Prime Minister
delivered a panegyric.
On April 2nd of this year, the seventh
anniversary of Mr Toda's death, the Soka
Gakkai launched a special year of pilgri-
mage to their holy of holies at the foot
of Mount Fuji, and the National Rail-
ways are constructing a special new
branch line to handle the vast numbers
of followers who will appear during the
coming months.
Another example of the effectiveness
of the organisation was seen at the last
election for Sangi-in, the upper house
of the Japanese Diet. The Komeikai or
political arm of the Soka Gakkai fielded
15 candidates, all of whom were easily
elected. On May 3 it announced it
would enter 30 candidates in the next
election for the lower house from which
all policy emanates, and it has stated
its intention to control both houses of
Parliament within 20 years. At the
present rate of progress it does not seem
an impossibility.
Governments and even nations have
succumbed to handfuls of less determined
men and the question as to how this
power will be used is frequently asked.
People have not yet forgotten the ultra-
nationalism of Shinto which culminated
in the Pacific War.
HThe propagation of the Soka Gakkai
A belief has often gained it adverse
newspaper publicity. The principle em-
ployed is that of shakubuku, which liter-
ally means to break and subdue. The ap-
plication is generally one of “logical
argument” such as might appeal to the
Japanese mind. Thus, in trying to dis-
prove the value of Christianity, they say
“Jesus died on the Cross. Therefore he
was defeated by his opposition however
posterity may interpret it.” It is worth
noting that the approach is distinctly
Oriental in emphasising the honor of
victory and visible strength. The subtle-
ties of the Western-based religion are
not considered coherent arguments. In
another instance they say “Christianity
speaks of original sin inherent in all
people, but a true religion must give a
man strength and not make him feel a
criminal.” All other religions are fiercely
attacked and the teaching of Nichiren,
like those of the Koran, even state that
to kill heretics cannot be considered mur-
der. While the shakubuku of the Soka
Gakkai does not actually incite its mem-
bers to murder, there have been several
incidents of physical violence by crusad-
ing zealots.
The movement is particularly strong
in young members who are enrolled in
a special youth corps. It has bands,
mass callisthenics displays, sports meet-
ings, and recently it inaugurated a
“People’s Music Council” to start a cul-
tural movement in Japan. Interest in
the Soka Gakkai is increasing at the
universities and more than 30,000 stu-
dents have formed themselves into cam-
pus study groups.
The reaction of the intellectual and
the businessman seems to be generally
the same —that the Soka Gakkai move-
ment is just a flash in the pan. “It will
soon fade away,” they confidently re-
assure you with a smile that indicates that
nobody with any sense pays much atten-
tion to the movement. The same sort
of reply was given by the same sort of
people five years ago now and the mem-
bership has risen by more than a million
a year since then.
It is not beyond the bounds of possi-
bility that the Soka Gakkai will succeed
to the spiritual and political leadership
of Japan within the next two decades
through the default of the responsible
people who have been laughing for the
last five years.

NOW WATCH OUT FOR THOSE INSIDE STORIES!
I have been a most inter-
ested student of Mr James
Bond, so it was with some excitement
that I noticed the advertisement in the
newspapers: “MI4 Investigations Ser-
vices. Enrol Now With the Austra-
lian Academy of Investigation”.
Clearly this was a school for private
eyes. I slipped my Ronson storm-
proof lighter into my fob pocket,
took out my 9mm Luger and strap-
ped on my shoulder holster.
After parking my 4i litre drophead
Bentley it was a matter of minutes
before I was seated opposite the chief
of MI4 in his Collins Street office.
He was tall, over six feet, and his
supple frame was clothed in a dark
blue suit. He was John Langham, a
former Melbourne CIB detective. I
told him that I was fit, ready, and
able to sign up with MI4 as an agent.
The disillusionment was not easy to
bear. Mr Langham gave a dry laugh.
He said they had no connection what-
ever with MIS. The similarity in
names was merely a coincidence.
Nor did the academy have any con-
nection with high-grade espionage; it
merely offered a 15-phase course for
£35 which covered process serving,
identification, fingerprints and the
bread-and-butter lines like accident
investigation for insurance com-
panies, missing persons and divorce.
Mr Langham showed me the course
notes and I quickly looked up phase
7, which gave advice on divorce work.
It said: “The motor car has now
become an important medium for
illicit consorting. Nowadays they are
fast and spacious and provide excel-
lent cover for acts that cannot be
carried out in parks and gardens.”
T'he course says that the untrained,
A after a lapse of time, no doubt
would rush the car when the two
occupants had moved to the back seat.
However, this could spoil everything.
They may be merely drinking beer.
The best method is to take along a
female agent, park close to the sus-
pect's vehicle, then move into the
rear seat of your car with your female
agent, so that you can observe
quietly what your suspects are up to.
Never approach their car unless you
are certain of gaining the necessary
evidence, then “announce your
identity, make your observations
quickly, and allow your parties to
regain their composure before inter-
viewing them”.
At the news that there were female
graduates from AAI my interest
quickened. Would one's agent in the
back seat be similar to the bikini-clad
maidens to be seen- in the ads for
the Fleming film “From Russia With
Love”? “Certainly not,” said Mr
Langham. It was necessary in the
investigation business that agents
should be as plain as possible.
Indeed, the job seemed devoid of
all interest until he brought out his
scientific equipment. He had, for
example, a beautiful camera built
into a transistor radio, and the idea
was to pretend to be listening to the
Top 40 while you were shooting pic-
tures.
So I took Mr Langham’s 15-phase
course, a pile of literature 12 inches
high. Obviously I will never become
a James Bond, but it will come in
useful. You may be amazed at some
of the undercover stories you will
read in The Bulletin from now on.

What’s Happened to Black & White?
“For gorsahe stop laughing , this is serious!”
By LES TANNER
Was Australia ever the home of
Black and White? It was a
home from about 1880 to 1918,
as a comparison with the London
“Punch” will show. It had considerably
more vigor and pungency, even though
we had our du Mauriers. But a com-
parison with the German magazine
“Simplicissimus” over the same period
will show that there were other homes,
and more richly furnished than ours. Our
reputation comes from the fact that we
provided a market and focus for talent —
since lost. G. R. and J. R. Ashton, Hop,
Phil May, David Low, D. H. Souter, Joe
Jonsson, Unk White, Ted Scorfield,
George Finey, Emile Mercer, George
Molnar is an impressvie list —none of
them was born in Australia.
Did we ever produce a world-standard
enduringly-great cartoonist? I think so in
Will Dyson; his work was uneven but
that reflected his own terrible doubts
about his talents. His sombre savagery
flared briefly into true satire in the
London “Herald” cartoons. His series
of etchings satirising middle-class adora-
tion of Freud are marvellous black
humor.
Will Dyson first appeared as a caricat-
urist. He mostly worked in tone and was
published in both The Bulletin and
Melbourne “Punch”. He went to London
on spec and after a year became a car-
toonist on the “Herald.” He was able
to give free rein to his passionate pro-
working man beliefs in a series of
cartoons that must have infuriated the
pre-1914 establishment in the way that
Lennie Bruce does today. He was an
exponent of the King Hit. One look at
a Dyson attack on anything was enough
to convince you that evil was afoot. He
had the same angry disgust that looms
through Daumier and Gilray. The cap-
italists that top-hat their way through
Left-wing cartoons since then are Dyson’s
poor orphaned descendants. Like many
savage satirists he occasionally seemed
to satirise himself in that the “workers”
swelled and shrunk depending on how
they were doing from time to time; and
the bosses were such evil, bloated demons
that it was hard to imagine they had time
to spare from their other general evils
to concentrate on the working class. He
went to the war as an official artist and,
in contrast to many who found the war
an interesting pictorial experience that
got you out of the office for a while,
he concentrated on the men themselves
and their predicament. His tragedy was
that the burning ferocity of his vision
was not acceptable to a post-war world
and particularly since Labor was no
longer a general term embracing all who
worked and espoused a general cause,
it now meant His Majesty’s Government
or His Majesty’s most loyal Opposition.
He had to become a sort of Kosi-stove:
no naked flame, just controlled heat. The
enclosed fire ate his heart and his talent
out. He returned to Melbourne to work
for the “Herald” but left again to Lon-
don where he died.
“The little boy at Manly”
lB5O up till the turn of the
century there was a proliferation of
illustrated magazines in Australia which
were the basis of Australian Black and
White art.
But the one that stands out above all
others is The Bulletin. If there is an
Australian black-and-white style it is
The Bulletin that founded it: for such
was its standing that virtually every im-
portant black-and-white man ended up
drawing for it.
Established in 1880, its first cartoonist
was William McLeod. The distin-
guishing characteristic of all the early
illustrators was their versatility. They
had to essay almost anything required of
them portraits, caricatures, news
events, disaster, jokes, general views—and
to plague them further they had to draw
in reverse, that is to say, what would
appear on the left hand of the illustra-
tion had to be drawn on the right. The
method of reproduction most favored
was the wood block. Boxwood was
mostly used and a section of the end
grain was prepared by painting on a
white ground. On this the artist drew
his design in ink. For large works say
a double spread—the wood was cut into
sections, handed to different engravers
who would cut away the “white” areas
leaving the “lines” raised; the completed
work was then bolted together and
printed. The result was inevitably stiff
and the loss in quality from the original
enormous.
The Bulletin was the first paper to
introduce process engraving to Australia
and this alone was to give its illustration
a tremendous boost in quality. Now the
artist needed only to draw sufficiently
clearly for the job to be photographed,
printed on to a zinc plate and the
“whites” etched away by acid.
Livingstone Hopkins Hop joined
The Bulletin in 1883 and he and Phil
May who arrived in 1885 founded what
has come to be called the Australian
Black and White tradition.
The two were quite opposite in their
approach. Hop was an American, aloof,
austere, puritanical. He placed great
stress on ideas, preferring his own to
anyone else’s. Genuinely inventive, he
was appalled by Tom Carrington's symbol
of the country as Minerva, goddess of
truth and wisdom. Typically, he saw
NSW in terms of “The Little Boy at
Manly”: a child dressed in old-fashioned,
“nice” clothes who stood about asking
pertinent questions, trying to be helpful.
He got the idea from a subscription list
for the Soudan contingent on which
appeared “A little boy at Manly—one
penny.” Hop’s humor was the cracker-
barrel drawl —Josh Billings type. This
laconic “no-bull” viewpoint was designed
to puncture the pretensions of Sydney
at the time, and it is interesting to note
that much of what we have come to
regard as essentially Australian in
comedy springs directly from 'American
humor of the ’Bos.
Phil May was so much an influence
here that many are convinced he was
an Australian. But he came from Lon-
don in 1885 at the age of 21 and re-
mained for only three years.
May had been earning from eight to
ten pounds a week and was offered 15
pounds a week to come to Australia.
Although interested for health reasons,
he held out until the bid was raised to
20.
In that short time he made 900 draw-
ings an astonishing output and
gave the term Black-and-White real
meaning.
To achieve his relaxed casual effects
he made a full-scale complete rendering
of his subject, tracing off from this the
essential lines and main areas of the
design. This was further refined until he
was satisfied. To an age used to “proper
drawing” it must have been a shock.
An executive of The Bulletin said to

him, “Look here, Phil, Hopkins puts a
great deal more work into his drawings
than you do. Can’t you finish yours a
bit?” May replied, “When I can leave
out half the lines I use now, I shall want
six times the money I am being paid
today,” a conversation that is still going
on in editorial offices.
Unlike Hop, Phil May was not at all
interested in politics and in fact de-
manded that cartoon ideas be written
out in detail for him. Where he excelled
was in liveliness of drawing and carica-
ture, in his love of drawing low-life,
his cheerful acceptance of vulgarity,
shines like a drunk's nose at a tea party.
J. F. Archibald delighted in anecdotal
detail in any drawing and used to en-
courage it in artists —even to stopping
them in the street to point out something
that to him typified some section of the
community or its pretensions It gave
freshness, flavor, identity to cartoons,
and it is precisely these qualities which
are lacking today. The quality of
definite locale and carefully-observed
characterisation is what puts current
British cartooning head and shoulders
over the shoddy parade of borrowed
types that persists in local cartooning
the burglar, the top-hatted business-
man, the dowager, the cannibal. This
lazy, uninventive use of tired symbols
would seem to indicate that Australian
artists have just stopped looking at what
is going on around them.
IYavid Low’s six years on the paper
were, despite his Billy Hugheses, no
more than a rehearsal for London. His
ferocious ambition had led him from
New Zealand at the age of 22 (he had
been a professional since the age of 11)
to Melbourne, where he joined The Bul-
letin staff and produced an enormous
output of caricatures, jokes and ulti-
mately political cartoons,' the best of
which he sent off to London editors in
the hope of attracting attention, He left
Australia bitterly denouncing its compla-
cency and meanness of spirit in a fare-
well letter to The Bulletin.
Norman Lindsay’s influence is curious
in that it was mainly confined to his
family. The central Lindsay manner is
common to Norman, Percy, Ruby,
Lionel and Ray. Those slanting, glinting
eyes seemed especially attractive to
them. It is ironic that much of the best
of Norman Lindsay’s work is in his
playful relaxed drawings of animals,
such as the characters in “The Magic
Pudding.” As a cartoonist he turned to
the brooding, sombre, “giant-forces-at-
play” view of the world. This is typified
by his deeply-felt but bathetic “The War
God Sounds his Gong,” and others
like it reproduced here.
It is regrettable also that so much of his
drawing went in a romantic celebration
of “great times”: Ancient Greece, Rome,
the Renaissance and the eighteenth cen-
tury. His persistence in a sort of cult of
grand bohemia in his drawing, after it
had died, is saddening to contemplate.
Our times have shown that barbaric
splendor had its obverse in barbaric
ferocity. Pan has now come off the
mountain and is teaching sex in the
High Schools. And we are all drearily
aware of the flesh under our Bermuda
shorts.
Great Days of Australian Black
A and White is now usually translated
to mean the ’3os and “Smith’s Weekly”,
which was founded in 1919 by Sir Joyn-
ton Smith, ex Lord Mayor of Sydney.
It was above all else dedicated to the
Diggers. It had a Diggers’ page with
jokes that kept up the old Dig tradition
so that to anyone born in 1927 the de-
tails of an infantryman’s trench dress
and living habits were as fresh in 1939
as they were to anyone who was in the
great stoush in 1914-18.
Such was its circulation and sup-
port that, even during the depres-
sion, it could not only keep all its
artists in employment but pay them
on a scale which today seems lavish. It
employed a vast band of joke artists,
caricaturists and strip cartoonists, many
of whom are still familiar names: Stan
Cross of “Wally and the Major” whose
other strip, “The Potts,” was taken over
by Jim Russell; Syd Miller, originator
of Chesty Bond whose Little Bear is still
fixing it; the late Joe Jonsson, creator of
“Uncle Joe’s Horse Radish”; George
Finey, brilliant cartoonist of the depres-
sion whose experiments in Dada predate
the collages of the Imitation Realists by
30 years. It was for “Smith’s Weekly”
that Stan Cross drew what was the best-
known cartoon in the country: “For
Gorsake stop laughing, this is serious.”
It was such a success that thousands of
copies were printed and sold. Stan Cross
was a master of expression and attitude.
He is, in fact, a natural comic strip
artist. He is unique in Australia in that
he now has a ghost to help him with
the drawing of Wally and the Major.
“Smith’s Weekly” died in 1950 while
trying to keep up a tradition of humor
that went with the two-line gag. Ameri-
can troops and airmail subscriptions gave
a new generation a taste of the “New
Yorker” it is surprising how recently
the one-line gag caused this revolution.
The period from 1950 was one of
general retreat. The war was over and
with startling speed the old standpoints
were robbed of their pungency. Will
Mahoney, recalling the war period, says
it was a question of drawing hands:
across the sea, up to stop the enemy,
clasped in anguish, outstretched in mute
appeal. Most of the cartoonists had
strong Labor sympathies, and found it
extremely difficult to be pungent on lines
with which they had little sympathy.
W. E. Pidgeon (WEP), one of the most
inventive and brilliant cartoonists of this
period, writing in “The Australian Art-
ist” in 1949, said, “Often the artist is
not the chooser of the path. Happy is
he who finds the going companionable.
On a path not overmuch to his liking,
the modern Pilgrim can avoid the worst
of the Horrors only by agile leaping on
to the fence or into the thickets of
Facetiousness.”
This was the problem indeed leap-
ing on to the fence. There was a gen-
eral retreat from the committed cartoon
into the never-never world of the topical
crack. Giles in London seemed the solu-
tion: loads of background to convince
you of value for money, characters al-
most just like you and me and a hearty
laugh all round at this funny old world.
It turned out we had had our local Giles
all the time although nothing like him
in manner and with a taste for grotes-
querie Emile Mercier. He became a
star cartoonist a genus unseen for
years and years. His gravy tins, his old
man on the tricycle, his identifiable beer
gardens, Bondi Junction fruit shops and
Paddington housewives were cut out and
posted up all over the country
TTowever, the most important cartoon-
ist of the post-war period was one who
found the going companionable and thus
was execrated all the more. He was cal-
led names like reffo, fascist, hand-biter
and even something he patently was not —-
bosses’ stooge. All the anger that the Left
could raise descended on the balding
skull of George Molnar. An architect,
he came to cartooning through pocket
cartoons after Osbert Lancastei out of
Steinberg. He rapidly gained genuine
identity of style against cries of “He
can’t even draw.” His drawings are styl-
ish, economical and uncluttered. In
short, he is utterly unlike anything seen
in a political cartoon in Australia. He
had intelligence, wit and teeth and
used all three. Because of him cartoon-
ists now have to look to their captions
and not just to their drawings.
The doldrums which settled in the
’sos are still with us today. There is far
too much looking for a new Vicky, a
new Giles, a new anyone as long
as it is not a new style. Australians
employed today in the top strata in
London are Arthur Horner, George
Sprod and John Jensen. Sprod has aban-
doned political cartooning for jokes in
“Punch.” Horner found the outlet for
his talent in a comic strip “Colonel Pew-
ter.” Jensen (almost unknown here) is
cartoonist for the London “Sunday Tele-
graph.” Three names among scores of
other talented international names do not
exactly point to this country as being
either a cradle or a home of Black and
White.

LETTER FROM LONDON
Homage to the Bard
Britain’s Shakespeare celebrations
By R. G. HOWARD
T>y April, celebrations for the Shake-
** speare Quatercentenary were in
full swing. Two days after the birth-
day there was a Shakespeare pilgrimage
to various sites in London associated
with his life. There is, of course, little
of Shakespeare's Bankside left. The
Church of St Savior (now Southwark
Cathedral), where he probably worship-
ped, has changed radically since those
days. The Bear Gardens are repre-
sented by a dingy alley between ware-
houses, while the site of the Globe is
occupied by a brewery.
Those interested in recapturing the
atmosphere of Elizabethan life did better
at a Kensington hotel whose exhibition
includes a not very convincing set-up
called “Backstage at the Globe” and a
much more authentic Elizabethan dining-
room. Since the Queen’s coronation
this hotel has been specialising in Eliza-
bethan food and after visiting the exhi-
bition you can, among other things,
eat Humble Pie which turns out to con-
tain an agreeable mixture of meat, fruit
and vegetables flavored with spice.
There have been about half a dozen
exhibitions. At the National Por-
trait Gallery a nicely titled exhibi-
tion (“O Sweet Mr Shakespeare, I’ll have
his picture”—a quotation from a 16th-
century play) displays representations of
him through the centuries, with a num-
ber of contemporary portraits retouched
to achieve a resemblance to the Bard
and then offered as paintings from the
life, and some complete forgeries. As
well as the famous First Folio engraving
in its various states, the portrait,
reversed, appears on the new stamps.
The stamps proved to be surprisingly
attractive. In fact they have a fair claim
to being the finest set of British stamps
yet issued.
A collection of paintings, drawings
and engravings devoted to Shakespearian
subjects, arranged by the Arts Council,
was disappointing. Although it contained
works by, for instance, Blake, Hogarth
and Reynolds, none of the artists gave
insight into the plays, except for the
single living one represented, Josef Her-
man, whose “Lear Destroyed” was
powerful and moving.
The comprehensive display of docu-
ments and books at the British Museum
provided an excellent survey of Shake-
speare’s influence. It also outlined the
fascinating story of his fate at the hands
of various adaptors and editors. What
a pity the celebrations did not include a
revival of “Lear” (happy ending ver-
sion), or one of the musical extrava-
ganzas based on “The Tempest”!
the Arts are paying homage to the
great man —drama, ballet, cinema,
opera, painting . . . there is even a
“Shakespearian Striptease Spectacular”
(“this Scintillating Smash Hit Edition is
‘As You Like It’ ”). The stream of books
devoted to Shakespeare has just about
flooded the bookshops, though no doubt
the percentage which truly merit publi-
cation is very small there are, for
example, two separate books on the first
Stratford Festival organised by David
Garrick. Perhaps the most intriguing
of them is a novel by Anthony Burgess,
“Nothing Like the Sun”, which imagina-
tively fills out the first part of Shake-
speare’s biography.
At the beginning of the year the Royal
Shakespeare Company re-presented “The
War of the Roses”, their adaptation of
“Henry VI” and “Richard III” as three
consecutive plays. These were splen-
didly produced with most exciting battle
sequences, and the first two benefited
greatly by the playing of David Warner
(Master Blifil in the film version of
“Tom Jones”) as Henry VI. These three
plays are being joined in Stratford by
new productions of “Richard II”, “Henry
IV” and “Henry V” in a continuous
cycle of the history plays. Before leaving
on a tour of the Continent, the company
also gave a few last performances of
Peter Brook’s “King Lear”, a production
already mentioned in the text-books.
More recently, Olivier has appeared
for the first time, at the Old Vic, as the
Moor of Venice. His reservations about
tackling the part were, apparently, quite
unjustified.
Innumerable other companies in Lon-
don and elsewhere are staging the plays.
A checklist of those plays being per-
formed, in the little handbook issued by
the Arts Council, reveals that the last
plays have been almost entirely neglected.
On the other hand, “Twelfth Night” is
receiving about twenty different produc-
tions throughout the country.
According to one estimate there are
76 films based on Shakespeare, but most
of these would be silent versions of little
interest. The National Film Theatre
presented an excellent selection whose
only serious omission is an example of
Orson Welles’ adaptations. Many of the
films are now quite rare and the copies,
not always very good ones, have had
to be borrowed from the most unlikely
places. The print of “As You Like It”
(England, 1936), which came from Den-
mark, unfortunately had such a bad
soundtrack one could scarcely hear a
line of the dialogue; and in the case of
“Romeo and Juliet” (USA, 1936) the
screen was often half obscured by sub-
titles in German and Polish (the credits
gave all the ladies’ names in engagingly
affixed versions: Norma Shearerova,
Edna May Oliverova, etc.). The best
film shown so far and the second best
Shakespeare film ever made according to
John Russell Taylor, writing in one of the
new Pelicans, “Shakespeare: A Celebra-
tion”, is Reinhardt’s “A Midsummer
Night’s Dream”. This has been shown
several times on TV in Sydney and seems
more delightful each time I see it. Its
incredible cast includes Mickey Rooney
as Puck and James Cagney as Bottom,
both giving brilliant performances.
Covent Garden offered “Otello” and
“Falstaff” by Verdi, and Britten's “Mid-
summer Night” but none of these were
exciting productions. There have been
and are to come miscellaneous musical
works related to Shakespeare, including
Berlioz’s superb “Romeo and Juliet.”

directed as a straight thriller, was
received by audiences with unexpected
hilarity. Now Young has evidently
decided to play for laughs. “From
Russia with Love” is treated frivolously,
and since it also manages to be an ex-
citing cliff-hanger, it affords as much
amusement as anything since “North
By North-West”.
This time the all-conquering Bond
takes off for Istanbul in pursuit of a
new Russian electronic decoder. Natur-
ally a beautiful, well-dressed Russian
agent is involved—but actually both she
and Bond are being used by the in-
dependent agency SPECTRE (Dr No’s
mob) who are playing both ends against
the middle.
Bond of course is equal to all this plot
and counterplot, and only once lets the
side down, when he’s fooled by a trans-
parently bogus British agent who says
“Glad to meet you” and orders Chianti
with fried sole.
Terence Young expertly puts the film
together. Sean Connery gives a droll
performance as the impossibly virile
Bond, and the supporting cast is expert.
The ravaged Lotte Lenya is wonderfully
funny as the SPECTRE agent who, when
presented with a new recruit, deliber-
ately dons a set of brass knuckles, gives
him a sharp blow in the solar plexus
and (when he doesn’t even gasp) remarks
with moderate approval, “He seems fit
enough”.
Anthony Asquith, a film director of
long experience, has in “An Evening
with the Royal Ballet” chosen to rely
on the method of placing his dancers
on a stage, and photographing them
from cameras placed in the centre stalls
and the two wings. His camera work is
rarely more imaginative than that,
except in the “Three Ivans” variation
from “Aurora’s Wedding”, when he
uses jump-cutting to such a degree that
all you see is an occasional arm or leg.
The four ballets shown are hardly an
adventurous choice. The most successful
is “Les Sylphides”, which does convey
much of the ballet’s dreamy magic.

Project ’64. From Stone Age to Space

T>ob Raymond's approach to his docu-
mentary on Woomera “From
Stone Age to Space Age” was just
about perfect and justified his high repu-
tation in this country as a TV writer and
producer. In some ways it was prob-
ably a simpler task than his “Gallipoli”
which depended- not merely on
archives plus contemporary film but on
emphasis and interpretation. This is not
to underestimate his new documentary
which was a very successful marriage
of visual impact and science thriller.
He told his story with considerable
simplicity considering the highly techni-
cal nature of the Woomera Project.
Some explanations might have been simp-
ler, or clearer, but that was probably not
the fault of the script. Some things stood
out, like the expert who explained the
difference in the degree of urgency at-
taching to military space projects against
those of a purely exploratory nature.
Another memorable interview was with
a British Ministry representative who
explained that the British, and presum-
ably the Europeans, through their associa-
tion in ELDO, were reluctant to go in for
manned space flights when they could get
much more information of value through
sending aloft sensitive recording equip-
ment.
The actual drama concerned in Blue
Streak’s dry run for its eventual firing
date (it’s not yet aloft as we go to press)
came through very well indeed and Mr
Raymond's team did a good job in visu-
ally conveying the technical aspects of
Woomera, the size and complexity of
which was described by Anthony Brown
in last week’s Bulletin. Mr Raymond
has a great gift for conveying things
visually by almost casual touches. I have
two clear memories of his documentary.
One is the immense size of the rocket
seen from inside a gantry lift as it slowly
ascended Blue Streak’s great length. The
other was the credit lines at the end
superimposed on the lonely, curving
desert road filmed from a fast-moving
car. Both of them together made his
title come alive.

masses for the Australian film industry.
The facts are too painfully obvious and
familiar to need any restatement, but,
during all the current lamentation and
protests, there remains one man notably
neglected, Cecil Holmes, who was
responsible for what is perhaps the best
local feature film of the sound period.
His “Three in One”, comprising stories
by Lawson, Frank Hardy and Rex
Reinits, received an enthusiastic critical
response overseas, but was denied full
cinema release here when it was made
in the early ’fifties. Not until Channel 9
screened it as a Friday Night Special
some time ago was it shown in its
entirety.
Holmes’ career after “Three in One”
was erratic. He scripted two excellent
radio documentaries for the ABC on
D. W. Griffith and Eisenstein, and made
a fine color documentary for the
Methodist Overseas Mission on mission-
ary work in New Britain, called “Lotu”.
In his ABC documentary, “I, the
Aboriginal”, he has got closer to the
essence of the Aboriginal mentality than
any preceding film-maker, and has cap-
tured much more than the customary
postcard impression of native cere-
monies.
He traces the life of Phillip Roberts
from his boyhood in the Alawa tribe
to his life today as an itinerant folk
doctor, helping to spread European pro-
gress to his race, and encouraging its
acceptance. He makes the point that
the primitive can be educated and then
disseminate his learning to others of his
people.
Technically, the film is inconsistent,
and as an adaptation of the book it lacks
continuity. Holmes’ cross-cutting and
flashbacks are arbitrary and uncomfort-
ably linked, either not at all or else by
old - fashioned dissolves between in-
animate objects—a glass or a cup is an
old favorite.
The cutting between the Darwin gar-
den party and images of his childhood
have a “meanwhile-back-at-the-ranch”
quality. Unfortunately this isn’t a sub-
ject suitable to a discursive, impression-
istic treatment, as Holmes gives it. It
requires a tighter, more ordered develop-
ment. Emotionally, the film is com-
mitted to Holmes’ continuing faith in
individual expression and dignity, but
Max Meldrum’s narration is too
chummy, and gives the script a patron-
ising air.
Translated from radio to puppet
television, “The Goon Show” loses
something of its disembodied idiocy but
gains in happy absurdity. It is sur-
prising that the transition is ‘such a
success. The puppets increase the reality
of the fantasy, and, albeit arbitrarily,
personalise the voices. Min, Henry,
Neddy, Bluebottle, Eccles, Moriarty
and the rest seem to me exactly right.
Now I can see them no other way
Neddy could not be other than a sort of
a beady-eyed Boy Scout, Eccles must be
a sort of kewpie-doll Pistol, and so on.

“JTlroilus and Cressida” is an extra-
A ordinarily difficult play to bring off
in the theatre. There are many long
passages of philosophical debate about
issues which the action never brings
clearly into focus; much of the language
is tortuous and abstract; there is no
compelling central personality, and no
consistency of mood. Unless the utmost
clarity of performance is achieved, the
danger is that an audience will be con-
fused and, ultimately, bored by the
subtleties and complexities of the play.
Boredom was never far away during this
performance by the Tin Alley Players.
Attention was constantly strained in an
effort to understand haltingly delivered
or carelessly articulated speech.
Worst offenders in this regard were,
unfortunately, two of the principals
Roy Leaney, as Pandarus, and Peter
Green, as Thersites. Janice Weldon’s
formidable task as Cressida must have
been greatly complicated by her
anxiety about Mr Leaney’s lines, and
Mr Green threw a good deal of un-
written confusion into the Greek camp.
More generally, an understandable lack
of resource in Miss Weldon’s perform-
ance, and in that of Philip Sargeant as
Achilles, blurred the significance of the
apparent contradictions in the behavior
of these characters; and the impressive-
ness of the debates was reduced by the
inadequacies of young men dressed up
as old men.
Nevertheless, this production had sub-
stantial merits. Producer David Niven
rightly prefers Shakespeare plain to
Shakespeare fancy, and if clarity was
not always achieved, it was, at least,
consistently aimed at. Creditable per-
formances were given by lan Harrison
and Peter Goodey, as Ulysses and
Hector respectively; and Alan Morgan,
fluent and passionate as Troilus, and
with a much greater range than any
other member of the cast, scored some-
thing of a triumph.
In “Troilus”, Shakespeare seems prin-
cipally preoccupied with the relationship
between violence and lust. William
Inge’s new play, “Natural Affection”,
tackles, in a much more head-on way,
the comparable relationship between
violence and the fear of rejection. The
method is pure realism, and this play is
a masterpiece of its limited kind. Here,
in the tougher territory of contemporary
Chicago, Mr Inge has managed to
avoid the sentimentality and small-town
philosophising which rendered phoney
much of “The Dark at the Top of the
Stairs”. Though the slice of life he
offers us may be noisome —it is hard
to imagine anyone actually enjoying
this play—there can be no denying its
authenticity. But Mr Inge’s very
success only serves to highlight the
limited value of the method he has used.
We feel towards his characters only
that mixture of pity and revulsion which
we would feel if we encountered them
in life. It seems to me that first-order art
directs response in a more significant
way than this; it seeks to analyse and
interpret, not merely to demonstrate.
The newly-formed, and welcome, In-
dependent Players coped quite well with
this powerful play. None of the acting
reached the desirable level of emotional
intensity, but Jennifer Claire and Colin
McEwan, in the leading roles, came
close. lan Westcott's production was
well-disciplined and clear in emphasis,
and the setting was admirably adapted to
the small stage.

POETRY
Desert Tribesmen
The naked old men of the desert walk
in single file along the bare rock-bed,
each with his arms wrist-clasped behind his back,
each with long hair bound back behind his head.
Now one by one the old men pause, lie down,
and drink from water underneath a ledge
of rock. Old Minyanderri lies face down
and drinks beside the water’s shadowed edge.
Slowly he rises, turns to me and says,
“If a man, with weakness like a knife
turned inside him, from the desert comes
and drinks this water, it will give him life.”
And shrill, fierce-throated flights of budgerigars,
in green and golden, zig-zag lightnings, pass
between the ghost-gum boughs, the red rock-walls
clasping the sky of opalescent glass.

Read me a poem tranquil as that lake

Read me a poem pristine as that lake,
as when, so mirror-clear, so deep it lies,
it seems no mountain imaged there could break
to fragments in those spiritual skies.
Read me a poem enchanted as that lake
stained with the crimson and purple of the dusk,
in the deep night a yellow star awake
above the steeps of myrtle and sassafras and musk.

Purple-pale irises

and give out their fragrances

And my life, that has been

An Ageing Process
More complex, more mundane:
The greater issues fade,
The mortal ones perplex.
Under a learning scrutiny
The lucid themes unravel,
The pattern shifts in light.
To be poised, witty, and grave,
To stay still and unblinking, is
To move towards an end.

The moon hovers
in the cover of clouds disturbed
by the hunting wind in their storm-scented coverts.
The moon stoops
over the acknowledging pale waters,
over reeds and bushes breaking the wrinkled broad.
The shallow wind
ruffles the sleeping bittern in the reeds;
the silent bird has strange and shifting dreams.
Light is driven
over the level water before the wind.
The hunter dozes uneasily in the markless light.
The moon flushes
him from sleep with a shiver of light on his face.
He is cold in the stirring boat and hours from dawn.
No birds fly
in the cold moonwalks of these scarred clouds,
and round him ripples point him an alien.
Light is cold
and clouds still cross the moon.
The boat is alone, after the end of land.

One Thing at Least
One thing at least I understood
Practically from the start,
That loving must be learnt by heart
If it’s to be any good.
It isn’t in the flash of thunder,
But in the silent power to give
A habit into which we live
Ourselves, and grow to be a wonder.
Some like me are slow to learn:
What’s plain can be mysterious still.
Feelings alter, fade, return,
But love stands constant in the will:
It’s not alone the touching, seeing,
It’s how to mean the other’s being.

Apology for Impatience
(For Gloria)
Now through all my dreams
Beans, beans are climbing,
Between midnight and morning
Pumpkins flower and the tomato seedlings
Are carefully transplanted;
Lying hunched in the darkness
I am solicitous over
All manner of things sprouting
And blossoming.
Even waking
The work goes on, a rainbow
Hovers over my office desk
In the arc of a garden hose,
And, looking at you,
Life, life, cries my blood
Till I am dazed by its sound,
The sound of my thirty-three years
Drumming like a monsoon
On the inadequate tin roof
Of words like these.

The Poisoned Grail
William Golding’s religious baby-talk
By DAVID MARTIN
The Spire. William Golding. Faber &
Faber. 225. 6d.
Tn this novel Golding carries on from
where he left off with “Free Fall”
in 1959. It is reasonably safe to pre-
dict that “The Spire”, too, will be
welcomed with the hushed reverence
reserved for cosmic fiction. It is very
much a book for Great Souls.
The story is extremely simple. Dean
Jocelin is intent on building a spire to
the glory of the Lord, an edifice 400
feet tall but with no foundations.
Whether it is God or Satan who drives
him on —or both—l am not altogether
certain, though Jocelin has an angel
standing behind him who, when the time
comes, smites him with an awful flail.
Compelled by a holy will-power he
literally thrusts, upward the people who
surround him, chiefly Roger Mason, the
builder, who knows that spires need
something solid to stand on and are not
held together by a nail of the true cross.
What is faith? Who is the demon? As
the work proceeds evil spreads. The
church is neglected. The workers bully
Pangall, the cathedral factotum, and
Mason is despairingly driven into sinful
love for Goody Pangall. She dies, giv-
ing birth to his child. A strange rela-
tionship grows up between Rachel Mason
and Jocelin himself. Father Anselm,
the Sacrist and Jocelin’s confessor, haunts
the Dean to his destruction and final
purification. The tower bends and may
be about to crumble: we cannot tell,
and whether it will or not depends on
the reader’s spiritual state.
The symbolism of the tremendous
spire, which is brilliantly sustained, and
the parts played by the women who are
the savior-destroyers in the tapestry of
this fable, invite a perfectly good Freu-
dian interpretation. But this is hardly
the point. As Jocelin says to Mason
when he discovers only a sort of brush-
wood raft on which the spire can be
raised: “Yet your craft can find nothing
certain, my son. You say they built a
raft. Why not believe the building
floats on it? It’s simpler to believe in
a miracle.”
Certainly, it is simpler, but Golding
knows that it is too simple. “The folly
isn't mine,” Jocelin declares. “It’s God's
folly. Even in the old days He never
asked men to do what is reasonable.
Men can do that for themselves. They
can buy and sell, heal and govern. But
then out of some deep place comes the
command to do what makes no sense
at all—to build a ship on dry land; to
sit among the dunghills; to marry a
whore; to set their son on the altar of
sacrifice. Then, if men have faith, a
new thing comes.”
Yes, but these things, while not
“reasonable”, can be done. But a tall
spire cannot be built in a mud hole: it
means the allegory is faulty and too
extreme. It would be foolish to
imagine that Golding is unaware of it.
He is not really concerned with the
command but with the deep places
whence it comes, or, rather, whence
men receive, derive or contrive their
commands. He has written not just a
morality but a psychological morality,
though, unfortunately, morality and
psychology confuse each other under
their mystical cloak.
Tt is the same difficulty, made still
greater by the absence of irony, which
one encounters with “The Celestial
Omnibus” or “Mr Weston's Good Wine”.
The total substitution of spiritual for
social relevance creates a stained-glass
twilight which saps as it “ennobles” the
style. At its best it matches the spire’s
soaring imagery, but this is only pos-
sible at high poetic moments. There
are some fine passages when Jocelin com-
pletes his calvary, but the effort to sup-
port so much biblical simplicity through
200 pages of mainly interior monologue
can also produce religious baby-talk . . .
“At first he could not understand why he
was welcome, but at last he found that
he was a specific against fear; and this
he was able to understand fully since
his angel was now in daily and nightly
attendance and performed the same
office for him, which was good, though
it bent his back a little.” What bends
his back is the weight of the spire.
This is no longer the language of
“Lord of the Flies”. Nor of Greene,
Mauriac and Bernanos who, whatever
they leave out in their plumbing of the
poisoned grail, evoke our critical intel-
ligence. Golding works at present in the
tradition of Wilde’s “The Happy Prince”,
enfeebled by James Barry and A. A.
Milne. Some have claimed that he and
Greene are closer to the mainstream of
French Catholic writers than to their
English counterparts, but in this case it
is patently absurd. “The Spire” is as
British as a Green Line bus and, like
Eliot’s work, invincibly High Church.
(Greene, still probably the most genu-
inely Catholic, has to find foreign settings
for his soul conflicts.) Not merely is it
not an intellectual novel, it is anti-
intellectual. In Golding’s builders the
Ibsen parallel is obvious, but we never
learn what wrecks them.
This leads to a deliberate obscuring of
the story’s inner links. Something ele-
mental happens between Jocelin and
Rachel Mason, but we cannot prove
what it is. There is also a dumb stone
carver who is little more than the con-
ventional fool in Christ. Anselm, the
Sacrist, comes nearest to achieving com-
plex significance, starting as a rancorous
carper and ending at what appears like
a true priest. Nothing is firmly estab-
lished, but much can be grasped on an
emotion - fantasy level. On one plane
“The Spire” represents the most abso-
lute escape yet from the English novel’s
miniscule preoccupation with caste into
a sort of pre-sentient awareness, a des-
perate return to the womb of romanti-
cism. On another it would seem to pos-
tulate an odd answer to contemporary
dilemmas. If it is true that we build
our lives on rush floats, on my reading
of the book we would have a fair chance
of being survived by what we build,
even if we have to pay with our mortal
bodies. Jocelin’s pride is divine and may
lead to hell or to heaven.
Such as they are, the human confron-
tations are as modern as in “Murder in
the Cathedral”, with a backdrop as


medieval. Golding does not manage the
ancient cathedral world very well; in
this, as in most other fields, Oliver
Onions remains his master. Jocelin is,
once again, an a’Beckett type, but too
innocent and wedded to the supernatural.
Of Mauriac it has been said that he
reaches timelessness by eliminating in-
finity, which is perhaps the only way in
which prose can reach it. With Gold-
ing, now, it is the opposite. Sexual detail
is a touchstone. Jocelin is a man-woman
for all that he keeps shooting arrows of
love at all who cross his path, and his
purely inward-directed obsession becomes
rather boring.
Golding, who has been called a genius,
strikingly demonstrates the impasse of
the writer in quest for allegorical solu-
tions. Too much a child of his time
to be sincerely simple about faith, too
sickened by it to have anything but
faith to prescribe, he wanders in a land
where men become children but are
punished as adults. He wants to go be-
yond Freud but cannot unfeel him,
beyond the ecstatic will but cannot re-
place it. His God is, in the end, only
a synonym for the subconscious, so that
his Christian ecstasy becomes a Zen
kaon, an inspired paradox. A not un-
impressive hotch-potch results which is
no more likely to rescue the English
novel from provincialism than the hard,
methodist stare at the metropolitan
provincialist. Less, in fact, because it
takes itself more seriously. Humility,
the hero, is the first victim —not surpri-
singly since a humble novel is almost an
impossibility.

and Dream” is never less
than adequate, when its author
examines British fiction since the 19205.
The book, in fact, comes as a sequel to
Mr Allen’s well-known “short critical
history” “The English Novel”. “Tradi-
tion and Dream” bears the prominent
subtitle “The English and American
Novel from the Twenties to Our Time”,
so that it widens the scope of his survey
and investigation: the earlier book closed
with a relatively brief handling of
novelists in England “who emerged round
1914”. This new critical work is worth
buying for the American material alone.
I don’t feel Mr Allen to be quite as
perceptive in his treatment of present-
day English novelists, however. He
seems to offer no really new insights: he
gives us little, anyway, that other critics
haven't handled at least as well (if in
smaller bites). In fairness, I should add
that there are several notable exceptions,
one of these being his consideration of
Henry Green’s novels. But Walter Allen
can even echo the already conventional
and certainly unjust judgment that, since
the novel “Hurry On Down”, John Wain
has produced “nothing to equal it in
attack or authority”: Wain’s direction,
surely, has simply changed: it has be-
come rather subtler. Mr Allen’s remark
might more aptly—possibly as unjustly—
be applied to Kingsley Amis’ fiction fol-
lowing “Lucky Jim”, which Walter Allen
(rightly, as I think) describes as “the
funniest first novel since ‘Decline and
Fall’,” yet he discusses four of Amis’
novels and only one of Wain’s. My
point is merely that a more objective,
more original approach could properly
reveal each writer’s individual qualities.
His firm-seeming generalisation about
Wain just isn’t supported by evidence.
When he is on surer ground (“ ‘Ulysses,’
rooted in the actual and the specific . . .
will remain” an “enduring influence on
the general reader and the general writer
alike”), Walter Allen is capable of what
strikes us as an almost Victorian depre-
cation: Joyce’s Marion Bloom, he com-
ments, “emerges as undifferentiated
female to the point of being purely
animal; so that if, as some critics have
claimed, she expresses Joyce’s affirmation
of life, one can only say that the life
affirmed is not more than life at the level
of rut and reproduction”. One can also
say, even if one believes that “Ulysses”
is a great, flawed masterpiece, that it
eminently suits Joyce’s purpose to pre-
sent such a rudimentary and elemental
woman at the heart, in this case the end,
of his vast urban novel.
Tn the American parts, Mr Allen’s com-
ments seem to me almost always
acute and relevant. Here, particularly,
we find much useful and interesting
background material, even a vivid deline-
ation, where appropriate, of the Ameri-
can scene. His diagnosis, in one instance,
of the state of health of the American
novelist establishes, perhaps, symptoms
for an Australian to ponder. Quoting
“W. H. Auden’s idea that ‘every Ameri-
can poet feels that the whole responsi-
bility for contemporary poetry has fallen
on his shoulders, that he is a literary
minority of one’, committed ... to a
wholly new start for poetry”, Walter
Allen then speaks of “American isola-
tion and alienation” and supports his
claim that “American novelists have
tended to live as solitaries as English
novelists have not” with such important
examples as Hawthorne, Melville and
Faulkner. “Isolation,” he says, “has
both advantages and disadvantages for a
writer. Nothing so strongly nourishes
ambition as the feeling that one is
different from one’s fellows and alone;
and when a man has no peers to measure
himself against, anything may seem pos-
sible to him. But if a man is to continue
to write and to remain alone the severest
self-criticism is called for if he is not to
lapse into indiscipline and eccentricity.
Faulkner, genius as he is, is a case in
point . . For good measure, Mr
Allen adds a comment on American
society: “Though it would be absurd to
deny the existence of a class system in
the United States, it is, for the majority
of Americans at any rate, largely a con-
cealed thing. Americans are certainly
much less aware of class than are the
English who, as the whole world knows,
are obsessed with it to a degree almost
pathological.”
Mr Allen notes the faults of the later
Hemingway—such as “what Arnold
called simplesse, the false simplicity of
The Old Man and the Sea’, compared
with the genuine simplicity of the much
earlier story . . . The Undefeated’.” But
he is very much aware of the earlier
Hemingway’s virtues, the fifteen short
stories of the fine “In Our Time”, for
example: the italicised vignettes linking
the stories set “then in a context and
perspective ... an extra dimension”
giving “a unity beyond that of a col-
lection of short stories. It is almost a
new form of fiction”. He isn’t afraid to
praise highly: “ . .. ‘A Farewell to Arms’
can stand comparison with ‘War and
Peace’ and ‘Le Rouge et le Noir’; it
is also one of the great pathetic love
stories of the world . . . Hemingway’s
description of the retreat is probably the
finest piece of writing on war in the
English language.” Walter Allen is very
good, too, on contemporary Negro
novelists (there is a fine, sensitive dis-
cussion, for example, of James Baldwin’s
“Go Tell It on the Mountain” and quite
an impressive examination of Ralph
Ellison’s “Invisible Man”).
He writes of the lewish-American
novelists —concentrating on Saul Bellow,
Herbert Gold and Bernard Malamud —
who “are bringing something quite new
into America fiction ... It is Jewish
certainly but . . . partly Russian. It is
not English”. His eleven pages on these
writers seem to me to break really new
ground, and he is also well worth read-
ing on Norman Mailer, Robert Penn
Warren, Thomas Wolfe, Sinclair Lewis,
John Dos Passos, Theodore Dreiser,
Nathaniel West, Malcolm Lowry, Faulk-
ner and Scott Fitzgerald. It’s only a pity
that Mr Allen’s terms of reference don't
allow him to examine writers like Mel-
ville, Hawthorne and the Mark Twain
of “Huckleberry Finn” in any sort of
detail.
A good, up-to-date “study of the
short story” is very much needed. I was
prepared to welcome Frank O'Connor’s
“The Lonely Voice”. Unfortunately,
Mr O’Connor is altogether too idiosyn-
cratic. He has sections on Turgenev,

Peeping Tom
Henry James and His Cult. Maxwell
Geismar. Chatto and Windus. 495.
9d.
T have never been a passionate admirer
A of Henry James. I have admired,
of course, his beautiful articulation of
subordinate clauses; his tact, taste and
intelligence: The placing of the semi-
colons in the opening paragraphs of “The
Turn of the Screw'’ must, for example,
be admired. The story, though, left me
always a little disappointed, a little be-
fogged and puzzled. Was I obtuse, was
there a secret I had failed to penetrate, a
nuance I had failed to catch? What did
it all mean? Now Mr Maxwell Geismar
in “Henry James and His Cult” has told
me: it means nothing; it is all a decep-
tion, a box of tricks, a brilliant display
of ingenuity only. Or rather, to go a
little deeper, it means that Henry James
was a very queer fish indeed and his
writing was an elaborate construction
which he erected to defend himself from
the knowledge of himself:
He is the supreme example of the
Rationalising Ego (in non- or pre-
Freudian terminology) which must re-
press the least hint of danger, either
in itself or in the world around it, by
a series of ever ascending, ever more
elaborate “explanations” which re-
move it farther and farther from any
kind of troublesome reality.
The thoroughly polemical nature of
“Henry James and His Cult” is enjoyable.
Maxwell Geismar is determined to cut
not only Henry down to size but those
he calls “the Jacobites” as well, and this
term seems to cover most of the best
known literary critics in America: F. O.
Matthiessen, Edmund Wilson, Lionel
Trilling, Leon Edel, F. W. Dupee,
R. P. Blackmur and Philip Rahv, to name
a few. Up to a point most of them de-
serve to be corrected for the excesses of
their adulation of the Master, and the
correction is delivered with energy and
sometimes wit, but like the good polemic


he is, Maxwell Geismar balances their
excesses with his own opposite ones.
The book is long and loosely written; the
colloquial style is engaging at first, but
long before page 444 I was tired of the
anacoluthia and rhetorical questions. A
rhetorical question that provokes the
answer that is not implied has defeated
its own purpose. The argument of the
book, carried on through a protracted
examination of the plots and themes of
the stories, is that James never under-
stood the world he was ostensibly writing
about, neither the “crude” American
millionaires, nor the “cultured” Euro-
peans; that his romantic conservatism
falsified history and was not interested
in the important social issues of his own
day; that in his attitude to sex he was
a kind of infantile Peeping Tom, always
on the point of finding out what his
“wicked” parents were up to on the other
side of the closed door; and finally that
in his own life he was a mercenary snob
and an egotist. And therefore, says
Mr Geismar, he cannot have been the
great novelist that the Jacobites say he
was —he was only a “major entertainer”.
It all depends on that “therefore”, which
strikes me as an outsize non-sequitur.
Mr Geismar is perfectly entitled to ob-
ject to James’ politics—and his objection
is at the bottom a political one: James
was reactionary, anti-American, anti-
democratic, and that was why the hey-
day of the Jacobites coincided with the
eminence of Senator McCarthy—but this
is not literary criticism. Even if —which
I doubt—all great novelists were in fact
radical, progressive, vigorously hetero-
sexual, and deeply committed on the
contentious issues of their day, it would
still not follow that this was a necessary
condition of their being great novelists.
Perhaps he was not great, but Mr
Geismar's debunking labors do not affect
the issue, though incidentally his discus-
sion of the novels offers a great deal of
both provocation and enlightenment. It
is notable that the one thing about Henry
James that is never discussed in “Henry
James and His Cult” is the style. A
random glance at any page—even those
pages so disparagingly reproduced from
“The Outcry” in this book —will show
that it's exactly here that the argument
must be carried. At his most involved
and oblique, dealing as he may be with
the minutiae of a trivial episode, the
writing of Henry James has a power,
vitality and fluency that very few can
emulate.

Beatle Book
John Lennon in His Own Write. John
Lennon. Jonathan Cape. 12s.
Cpike Milligan would barely recog-
nise himself in Beatle John Lennon’s
fantastic collage of goon-like trivia,
“John Lennon in His Own Write”, so
far has Lennon taken his peculiar brand
of idiocy and surrealist blind-man’s-buff.
But this is not all pure zaniness and
absurdity for its own or its creator’s
sake, as Milligan’s humor is, because
John Lennon has a Sense of Social Pur-
pose. Or rather he has a mixed bag of
old and borrowed stones to throw in no
particular direction for no particular
reason. His macabre little parables bur-
lesque all the stock targets of the con-
temporary comedian —narcotics, deaf
mutes and paraplegics, racialism, anti-
Semitism, paranoia, sadism, socialism,
and so on. But unfortunately the social
comment, no matter how bitter or how
casual, seems a little self-conscious and
unfelt, a little imposed upon the non-
sense almost like an afterthought to
justify it. The series of fragments,
poems, playlets, and line drawings do not
need such justification, however amusing
it may be.
When Lennon contents himself with
parody or sheer, uninhibited foolery, he
is extremely funny. He sends up every-
thing from Enid Blyton (or, as he calls
her, in “The Famous Five Through Woe-
now Abbey”, “Enig Blyter”) to Princess
Margaret (“Priceless Margerine”), Doc-
ker Adenoid and the Cornmen Margate.
His language gets weirder as the book
progresses, like a mixture of puns, ono-
matopaeic fun and games, and Joycean
coinage. For example, Lennon, in his
“teenold brown sweaty” is “accoustic” in
the “Neville Club” by “boils and girks
sitting in hubbered lumps, smoking
Hernia and Odeon and going very high”.
And in the poem “On This Churly
Morn” it becomes almost totally mean-
ingless:
Bilt zeitung dairy apple,
Of geltzie sniedypye,
Groppy gribble grapple,
Varoum the reason why?
until the book ends:
Bumbleydy Hubledy Humbley
Bumdley Turn, (Thank you).
This is a long way from “All My Loving”
and “I Wanna Hold Your Hand”.
John Lennon is much closer to Peter
Sellers himself than he is to Sellers’
famous caricature of a teenage idol,
“Mr Iron”. He is an intelligent and
witty humorist and an imaginative writer,
and he is also a most unusual artist. The
spidery, slightly grotesque drawings that
illustrate his book are as idiosyncratic
and as funny as his prose. He is, in
the words of fellow Beatle, Paul McCart-
ney, who wrote the short introduction, a
bit “deep”. He says himself, in his auto-
biographical note “About the Awful”,
that, “as far as I’m concerned this cor-
rection of short writty is the most won-
derful larf I’ve ever ready”. Perhaps
you may have ready other writty that
gave you more than the passing larf that
“John Lennon in His Own Write” offers,
but it’s never been quite the same larf,
and it’s never come from such an un-
expected source.

Damned, The Rough Crossing,

Five: Short Stories (First Volume).
Selected and introduced by Malcolm
Cowley. 31s.
Ccott Fitzgerald's sovereign quality
was integrity, and this was recog-
nised by a discerning public. His stories
were all of himself and his generation,
and the problems of his characters were
the small problems of members of his
own crowd —of Ardita, the first girl to
smoke in the respectable pages of the
“Post” (she extracted a cigarette and lit
it with a conscious coolness though she
knew her hand was trembling a bit), of
Bernice, in “Bernice Bobs Her Hair”, of
Adrian Smith of “The Rough Crossing”
who was Fitzgerald himself, drunk and
dispirited and philandering and fighting
with his wife on a transatlantic trip.
In the Bodley Head series, the con-
tents lists immediately point to what
must surely be an editorial lapse. “The
Diamond as Big as the Ritz,” that fan-
tasy which, following a theme he used
again and again, forecast Fitzgerald’s
own destruction, is in Volume Five,
though it appeared in Volume One. “The
Rough Crossing” is in Volume Four and
in Volume Five. “The Rich Boy” is
in Volumes Three and Five, “The Crack-
up” in Volumes One and Three, and it
seems inevitable that “Babylon Revisit-
ed”, which is in Volume Four, will ap-
pear again in Volume Six, according to
the pattern of the stories.
The editor of a collection of much-
published stories frequently has a choice
of versions. Take this example from
“Babylon Revisited":
“As they came in, a murmur of
‘. . . adorable’ followed them, and now
the people at the next table bent all
their silences upon her.”
As that first appeared, in 1931, it
read,
“As they came in, a murmur of
‘What an adorable child’ followed
them, and now the people at the next
table bent all their silences upon her.”
The Bodley Head version is certainly
more polished, and presumably follows
Fitzgerald’s own revisions, but the dozen
alterations in this story alone complicate
the work of the student. It is an edi-
torial problem for which there is no easy
solution.

BUSINESS AND FINANCE
Some Unequal Growth
Australia’s National Income and Expenditure figures for
the March quarter of 1964 reveal an estimated Gross
National Product of £2079 million, or about 7.7 p.c. higher
than the corresponding quarter in 1963. Analysis shows that
the extra spending is in the hands of farmers (because of extra
export income) and the Government (because of last year’s
stimulated spending to get things moving again).
At the same time, private investment in fixed capital equip-
ment, other than buildings, im-
proved by only 2 p.c., indica-
ting that the spending is a bit
lopsided.
The motor boom continues,
but the rise in the three months
to March has tapered off to
6 p.c. on the December quarter
compared with an 11 p.c. rise
in the previous quarter and
an 18 p.c. rise in the September
quarter.
Total personal consumption
expenditure was £1274 million
or 6 p.c. more than the corres-
ponding March quarter of 1963,
while wages rose by 8 p.c.
There has been no marked
build-up of stocks and this could
be taken as an indication of the
higher consumption of materials
in manufacturing industries.
It could also indicate an increas-
ed appetite for import replace-
ment. In fact, imports were up
11 p.c. in the March quarter
compared with an increase of a
mere 3 p.c. in the December
quarter, so it may be assumed
that the import trend is definitely upwards.
These signs, combined with the existing demand for skilled
workers plus pressures for wage increases, no doubt are
influencing the Treasury’s efforts to contain cost and infla-
tionary bulges as they appear. But trading bank officials
last week seemed anxious to indicate that they should not be
made to bear the burden without some recognition that the
credit restrictions are Government policy.
Putting the Squeeze on
Home Finance
"Oeserve Bank suggestions that savings banks should
moderate the rate of increase in their lending for home-
building is desirable enough if current pressures are forcing
up prices in the building industry. But it is completely irra-
tional if seekers of home loans are forced away from rela-
Australia’s Gross National Product

tralian Gross National Product for the five years up to 1962-63.
Quarterly movements to March in the current 1963-64 year

tively cheap finance by switching their loan applications to the
finance companies.
This would only inflate the cost of a house. True, it would
remove home ownership from the grasp of some who could
not afford the higher cost. But, also, it could influence others
to go in over their heads and take on commitments difficult
to repay.
America, which is one of the most credit-conscious nations
in the world, has managed to
keep interest rates on home
finance down to a reasonable
level, and the relative ease with
which a prospective home
owner can obtain long-term
finance is not necessarily re-
garded as the worst stimulant
to inflation.
Building of a home, of course,
encourages the purchase of
other items, notably furnishings,
which often are bought on
hire-purchase. But the initial step
of owning a house is regarded
as an essential which should
be encouraged with cheap
finance and government back-
ing.
By all means, if building pres-
sures are too great, it is in the
interests of the community to
restrain the demand so that it
evens out and avoids a boom
and bust. Yet if restrictions on
cheap finance merely push the
home buyer into a situation
where he borrows at higher
interest, it is hardly a matter of public benefit. After all,
those mortgage loans go on for 20 or 30 years.
If you squeeze a balloon at one end, you can get a bigger
bulge at the other end.
Japan Also Affected by
L&bor Shortage
\ keen and growing demand for industrial workers is net
only visible in Australia and among members of the
Common Market. Japan has just become the latest country
to face an acutely tightening labor demand.
Japan's position was apparently serious enough during 1963,
as productive bans were gradually lifted throughout manu-
facturing industry. Accelerated pressures are likeiy to deve-


lop in the 1964-65 financial year while the economic “recovery”
gathers pace.
Remembering Australian employment fears a year or so
ago, it seems interesting to observe that the Japanese problem
is heightened by a drop in the number of school-leavers.
So far as 1963 was concerned, some relief from the
obtruding manpower shortage came through a distinct lift in
labor productivity. All industries taken together showed an
increase of 9.8 p.c. Manufacturing pushed up productivity
9.4 p.c. and mining 18.9 p.c.
With a relatively small rise in employment, earlier industrial
modernisation made a significant contribution to the greater
output. Indeed, manufacturing industries accomplished a
10.6 p.c. higher volume of production on a mere 1.4 p.c.
increase in the labor force.
Like most industrial countries, Japan intends to take steps
to encourage labor mobility. The Labor Ministry also hopes
to offer more opportunities to middle and old aged workers.
There are to be positive attempts to improve conditions in
the smaller-sized enterprises.
Home Appliances More Prominent
in HP Financing
Tt seems a far cry to the piping days of pre-squeeze 1960,
A when, among other key indicators, hire-purchase outstand-
ings were often adduced as evidence of a runaway boom. In
the present economic ebullience, Dr Coombs, for a while at
any rate, finds it sufficient to preach moderation and a sense of
responsibility to instalment credit financiers.
The non-retail finance houses took until November, 1962,
to bring balances outstanding above their 1960-61 monthly
average of £398 million. As at February this year these
balances had climbed well ahead of that once-dangerous figure
- to £457 million, in fact.
A number of the HP financiers told The Bulletin last
week that domestic appliances are coming well into the
picture again, in accord also with the trend in production and
retail sales. Motor vehicle finance is still abundantly healthy,
but it will be good news to. both manufacturers and investors
that such things as television sets and refrigerators are making
a definite come-back.
No Tears for the
Loan Shortfall
Shortage of available money was not the reason for an
under-subscription of £6.4m. in the latest Commonwealth
loan of £4om. Total loan subscriptions from all sources have
already reached a record of £3l6m. for 1963-64 and have
left the Treasurer with money running out of his ears. The
recent general rise in interest rates caused some people to
hold off for the time being, believing that the next loan may
offer a shade more than the last.
Reserve Bank policy at the moment is towards higher
interest rates to siphon off any excess liquidity and, with
this in mind, it is felt in some quarters that the May, 1964,
loan with its long-term rate of £4 14s. p.c. might be a step-
ping stone to a still higher rate.
The shortfall of £6.4m. in loan raisings for the year to
June will be scaled down by the end of the financial year,
because subscriptions are still coming in for the Series J
Special Bonds, which were opened for subscription last
February to encourage small holders.
With a record of around £32om. in sight from all loan
sources, including £lßm. from a London loan last October
and £lom. from State Government borrowings on overseas
markets, the Treasurer has no difficulty in meeting the public
works and housing programme for £272m. Also, with taxa-
tion revenue rolling in at a level higher than estimated, the
Treasurer has no real financial problems. In fact, against the
recent background of heavy Government expenditure, which
has now achieved a major objective of reducing unemploy-
ment, the Government may be accused of competing for men
and materials on a scarce labor market.
Thus the Commonwealth Government has a ready-made
excuse at the next Loan Council meeting to urge moderation
in Government spending. The flexible interest rate technique
is indeed proving a powerful weapon at this stage.
International Liquidity Gets
Orthodox Handling
/Orthodox monetary devices appear destined to triumph over
the brave new plans for improving international liquidity
which were all in the air only a short time ago. Surprisingly
enough, current orthodoxy seems to be largely embodied in
the International Monetary Fund.
At all events, IMF officials have recently been fostering
an atmosphere of calm, doubtless with one eye on the meeting
of world Finance Ministers to take place in Tokyo this
month.
The deputy managing director, Mr F. A. Southard, Jnr,
sounded particularly optimistic addressing a Texas audience.
‘There is, in my view, no fatal flaw in the structure, scope
and efficiency of the international monetary system. I believe
that the more far-reaching proposals to reconstruct the system
are unlikely to accord with the judgments of most monetary
officials who are responsible for the functioning of the
system,” he said.
Mr Southard took an equally firm line against such radical
notions as increasing the gold price: “A rise in the price of
gold W'ould be an irrational and uncertain way of increasing
liquidity and, all other reasons apart, might in the longer run
do irremediable damage to the incentive to hold currencies
as reserves, which is an integral and important part of the
present system.”
The Fund was further extolled by its managing director,
Pierre-Paul Schweitzer, when he spoke to the United Nations
Conference on Trade and Development at Geneva. Perhaps
the under-developed countries expected more than an
assurance that “There appears to be scope for international
co-operative action between creditor and debtor countries for
the purpose of preventing an overload of short maturity
indebtedness on the developing countries.”
The succession of comforting assurances probably adds up
to an enlargement of IMF quotas as the best resources to cope
with future liquidity problems. Nothing on the scale of
1959’s general 50 p.c. increase can be envisaged.
In all fairness, though, it must be recognised that a body
which has been able to treble drawable funds in the 19
years since establishment commands a good deal of potency
and respect. The IMF has also been responsible for initiating
other “backstop” mechanisms to handle balance-of-payments
difficulties notably the reserve arrangements to borrow
from the “Club of Ten” big industrial nations.
A large measure of the immediate contentment derives from
the apparently healthier position of the American payments
deficit. The US authorities themselves admit a substantial
basic improvement, but also indicate that the striking reduc-
tion of the trade gap in the first few months of 1964 was
exceptional. The process towards balance must certainly be
very gradual.
The defence of monetary orthodoxy is also joined by
another conservative group Western Continental Europe
anxious to deal with its own inflationary strains. The time for
turning the IMF into a credit-producing bank, with such aids
as “composite reserve units”, has been further postponed.


ECONOMICS ANONYMOUS
New Slant on Economic Growth
Professor LydalVs Coghlan Memorial Lecture
Walking about the great changes over
the years in the main subject matter
of economics when delivering the
Timothy Coghlan Memorial Lecture at
Melbourne University last week, Profes-
sor Lydall, of Adelaide, said that econo-
mics could no longer be called the dismal
science, an attribution deriving from the
pessimistic theories of Malthus and
Ricardo. All those theories and static
conceptions about the optimum allocation
of resources, which swam into vogue
last century, had gone into limbo. We
had even got out of the Keynesian cul-
de-sac, with its break-through on how to
achieve full employment. The big
question now is economic growth. How
fast can we scale the heights?
In the 20 years since economic growth
has been the main subject matter of
economics, it has generally been assumed
that investment in capital equipment is
the prime mover of growth. A big body
of theory, by Harrod and others, was
built on this assumption. Now, said
Lydall, much of this theory is proving
illusory. Economists are getting away
from the idea that capital investment is
the sole or even the predominant force
behind growth. It seems that this revo-
lution in the science has barely permeated
local thinking on the subject. But it is
certainly sweeping America, even though
it is as yet in its infancy.
In his “Sources of Economic Growth”,
Professor Denison has attempted to give
a series of weights to the importance of
various forces he has discovered to have
motivated economic growth in the United
States over the period 1929-57, when
the average rate of growth in the US
economy was 3 p.c. To put it most
simply, if one considers this 3 p.c. to be
composed of 12 parts, Denison says six
°f them or half the total would be
attributable to the contribution of labor,
arising from increases in both numbers
and quality of labor, and only two parts
would represent the contribution of capi-
tal equipment. That is to say, two-thirds
°f the total would be attributable to
capital and labor combined. The other
1 P-c. would be split 6 : 4 between ad-
vances in knowledge and techniques, and
e conomies of scale.
on the basis of Denison’s
analysis, Professor Lydall says the
inclusion for Australia is that expendi-
tllre on capital equipment by itself is not
tlle optimum solution to the problem of
increasing growth here at a faster rate.
Rather, we should be concentrating on a
co-ordinated approach which includes
massive expenditures on education and
research, and efforts to increase econo-
mies of scale. Nearly a quarter of the
total contribution to America’s growth
from 1929-1957 came from improved
standards of education, according to
Denison’s analysis.
Unfortunately nobody has attempted a
similar exercise for Australia. In fact,
Lydall thinks it would be most difficult
in view of the lack of data. However,
because the main industrial advance of
this country has taken place since 1929,
one would expect capital investment to
have played a much bigger role in growth
here than in the US over the period.
Even in 1929, the US was a highly
developed industrial country and on a
percentage basis its subsequent additions
to capital equipment may conceivably
have been lower than here, though this
is by no means certain. At all events,
it is conceivable that so far we have
rated the contribution of labor to growth
far too low as a factor in economic
growth in the past. It is clear we should
not underrate its future importance.
T ydall thinks it would be wise to
put a lot more of our resources
into increasing the efficiency of labor
and pointed out that in view of the very
low (from 2} to 3 p.c.) percentage of re-
sources now going into education, a
proportionate rise in expenditure on
capital equipment would involve a very
much greater volume of resources. But,
in the light of Denison’s findings, it would
seem that for equal additional volumes
of extra resources put into capital in-
vestment and labor, those put into labor
would give three times the return in
terms of national growth. In other
words, in these terms marginal expendi-
ture on labor efficiency yields three
times marginal expenditure on capital
equipment.
In explaining the slower rate of growth
of the Australian GNP (about 4 p.c.)
over the period 1952-60 (for which he
had full international comparisons) com-
pared, say, with the from 7-10 p.c. in
Western Germany and Japan, Lydall put
stress on the opportunities available to
the latter two countries to draw a big
supply of labor away from the less
efficient rural sectors of their economies
into their industrial sectors. It seems
that we have no such reservoirs of labor
and must rely on other sources. This
is certainly a huge problem in the task
of lifting our growth rate. It is signi-
ficant that in the last two years, when
we have been able to draw on reservoirs
of unemployed, school-leavers and
migrants to a greater extent than pre-
viously, we have managed to lift the
growth rate in real terms towards that
of Japan and Western Germany (in the
March quarter our GNP rose by 7.7
p.c.).
we have reached the stage of vir-
tual full employment it would not be
surprising if the increase in GNP dropped
to nearer the 1952-60 rate of 4 p.c.
before very long. This, incidentally, was
the figure named recently by Dr Coombs
as about the limit we could expect, given
the present level of resources. To attempt
to get higher than this in present cir-
cumstances of labor shortages could
easily run us into inflation. In the light
of the reduced role Denison gives to
fixed investment in promoting growth,
and as Dr Coombs obviously thinks
capital investment is now rising very
rapidly, it will be interesting to see if
the investment increase is accompanied
not by a further rise in GNP but by a
decline from recent rates of increase.
The latter could easily happen if prices
rise significantly. Of course, the GNP
has to be measured in real terms for this
purpose.
As for other reasons why Australia’s
growth rate has been disappointing on an
international comparison, Lydall seems
to agree with Dr Kojima’s indictment
(see The Bulletin, May 2) and also
with Professor J. B. Condliffe (Stanford
Institute report on the development of
Australia) that the entrepreneurial func-
tion is relatively weak here. He asked
some fairly blunt questions, such as “Is
BHP as dynamic today as under the
dynamic influences of Essington Lewis?”
He also said that far too many com-
panies were run by officials nominated by
overseas parent companies. He would
like to see more vigor in private enter-
prise to speed growth. He thought we
should experiment with more of the suc-
cessful industrial growth schemes tried
overseas, such as the establishment of
industrial estates.
Equally, Professor Lydall suggested
greater recognition should be given to
the place of public corporations and
their leaders in the industrial scheme of
things. We might with advantage move
towards more partnerships between pub-
lic and private enterprise. The public
entrepreneur has “arrived” and is des-
tined to play a very much more impor-
tant role in economic growth.


“CROESUS”
A Preference for Persuasion
Sir James Kirby's vieivs on overseas capital
“Economists are not good decision
makers," Sir James Kirby, chairman
of the Manufacturing Industries Advisory
Council, told a university audience in
Melbourne recently. Obviously, from
the number of economic questions Sir
James had answers to in his bus tour
around the economic scene on this occa-
sion, businessmen, himself in particular,
are. Apparently economists should stick
to the facts and their unravelling, leaving
the decisions to you know who.
There was hardly an economic stop
where Sir James didn’t alight. At some
he stayed longer than at others and was
more dogmatic about the requirements.
One of these was the contentious ques-
tion of the desirability of unrestricted
capital inflow. In short, he would not
contemplate any formal restrictions
either on the entry of overseas capital
or the servicing of it, but would rely on
persuasion to see that the interests con-
cerned acted to our national advantage.
As for a suggestion from the audience
that in certain circumstances restriction
of dividend remittances overseas might
be desirable, Sir James wouldn't have a
bar of it. Dividend remittances may be
a long-term problem for the balance of
payments, he said, but it was much
more important to keep the door open
now lest restriction prompt turning off
the tap of capital inflow, which was
looking after our net overseas payments
for invisible imports very nicely as well
as filling a hole in local supplies of
capital. The most he would say is that
dividend remittances should be kept
under constant review for balance-of-
payments reasons.
As for limiting capital inflow itself
when exports were at their present
strength, he said we would live to
regret it in times when exports were
down and when we would be looking to
capital inflow to repair the gap in the
balance of payments.
Even looking many years ahead, Sir
James couldn’t visualise the time
when overseas capital, with all its atten-
dant advantages such as the provision of
overseas know-how and technology,
would not be essential to development
here. However, on a somewhat narrower
view, he said that we could probably
become independent of it if export earn-
ings rose to, say, £l5OO million, or some
£2OO million higher than they are ex-
pected to be in the current year.
One can go along with all this except
that Sir James appears to pin rather too
high hopes on overseas companies re-
sponding fully to local persuasion to
conform to our national interests. They
have certainly invariably conformed in
the past, as witness takeovers such
as Unilever's of Rosella or Plessey’s
of Ducon, which are no more than cold-
blooded substitution of overseas owner-
ship of existing Australian businesses and
have added nothing to our material re-
sources whatsoever. Sir James thinks
that all one has to do is to talk to these
sort of people and, because they are
mindful of their own company images,
they will do the right thing by us. This
must be doubted strongly.
Unlike many critics of foreign invest-
ment, Sir James believes that overseas
companies coming here should provide
the bulk of the equity capital for their
enterprises. Yet, as he also thinks there
should be some Australian participation
both in their capital and direction, he
appears to be more concerned about the
recourse of such companies to Australian
borrowing than about the facts of owner-
ship. In his view, their borrowing
should be restricted to funds required for
working capital, leaving the fixed capital
required for real estate, plant and equip-
ment, etc., to be provided from overseas
sources.
Curely overseas companies are not
likely to take much notice of local ad-
vice, whoever might tender it, to confine
their local borrowing to working capital.
Nor, without some official rules, are they
likely to ignore instructions from their
overseas parent companies not to export
to areas already covered by the parent
company or some other subsidiary,
instructions which have braked Austra-
lian export development, particularly in
manufactured goods. It is fcr too opti-
mistic to expect all restrictions on fran-
chises to melt away merely through
persuasion, as Sir James appears to think
possible, though he is right in saying all
restrictions on such franchises should
be terminated.
Without mentioning figures either for
the percentage of the equity capital or
for the numbers of board seats he would
like to see reserved for Australians, Sir
James, in answer to a question, was
critical of the equity capital policy of,
say, the likes of GM-H (but not of the
contribution GM-H had made to the
economy). He could not see a way out
in the case of GM-H. The listing of
the US parent here, for instance, was not
a satisfactory alternative to listing the
local company itself.
Of course GM-H was not an isolated
case and Sir James indicated that some of
the big insurance companies (he is, inter
alia,- a director of the MLC) are con-
cerned that they are practically shut out
of investing in some of Australia’s
biggest industries in consequence of the
dominance of overseas-owned proprietary
companies in them.
Sir James suffers from no in-
hibitions in his catholic collection of
directorships, because his top pick for
offenders in this respect was the motor
industry (he is a director of British
Motor Corporation Pty Ltd), followed by
the petroleum (he is a director of CSRC-
Dow Pty Ltd, part of the Altona petro-
chemical complex) and the chemical in-
dustries. With irons in some of these
fires, it would be natural for anybody
to prefer persuasion to legislation to open
the way for Australian investment in
them.
Wrongly interpreting Sir James' mood,
a questioner wondered whether he would
prefer overseas capital to come in as
portfolio rather than direct investment,
The answer was no. For one thing,
portfolio investment is fickle and, as
happened in the past with US portfolio
investment, is liable to desert us when the
economic barometer drops, while direct
investment has, of necessity, to stay put.
For another, direct investment brings
many benefits with it, as mentioned
above.
Not the least of these benefits is that
it keeps industry here abreast of over-
seas research, technology and know-how.
This is all-important for us because of
the poverty of research in Australian
secondary industry, a gap in our indus-
trial defences which Sir James has done
as much as anybody to help repair (he
is chairman of the Nuclear Research
Foundation w'ithin the University of
Sydney).
In Sir James’ view', at the present
snail’s pace of the local effort it will be
a very long time indeed before we can
deny ourselves the fruits of overseas
industrial research. That is no reason
for sitting back and depending so much
on it. Apparently the Manufacturing
Industries Advisory Council has been try-
ing to get the Government to give sub-
stantial tax allowances on industrial
research expenditure, but the suggestion
has been turned down. Yet, said Sir
James, innovation is all-important in
capturing overseas markets in manufac-
tured goods and is closely linked with
the task of improving productivity, which
he thinks should be increasing much
faster, say at 3 p.c. 'a year.

Felt, Vinyl, Success as Floorcovering
Sharing the prospects of the rest of the industry
To expand the story on floor-
coverings, The Bulletin this week
deals with felt and vinyl. Although
manufacturers face keen compe-
tition at home and from overseas,
they are certain their future is
sound. It is expected there will be
a growing use of vinyl, due partly
to wider acceptance as a floor-
covering and also because manu-
facturers claim lower prices. With
felts it is claimed the market will
be held because Australians are
wool conscious and because of “the
value for the outlay of money” .
T ast week The Bulletin examined
carpets and linoleum in its article
on the floorcovering industry in Aus-
tralia. This week the other forms of
covering—vinyl and felts —are included
and the feelings within these sections
of the industry echo the others. Manu-
facturers expect an expanding market
and, they hope, lowered imports because
of the increasing efficiency in the Aus-
tralian industry.
An executive of Felt and Textiles of
Australia Ltd said that despite a drop in
the level of imported floorcoverings “they
continue to provide a strong source of
competition”. He said: “Competition
within Australia is very keen, due to the
increase in production potential within
Australia. Notwithstanding the fact that
imports of soft floorcoverings since 1956
have dropped from 52.3 p.c. of the total
square yardage supplied to the Austra-
lian market to 30.4 p.c. last year they
still compete with us strongly.
“We anticipate that competition will
increase in the future due to the growing
efficiency of the Australian soft floor-
covering trade. This increase in effici-
ency is reflected in the reduction of im-
ports.” The executive added that his
company's sales and production at pre-
sent are higher than last year. “We
estimate that production for the 12
months to June, 1964, will be 20 p.c.
higher and that sales will show a lift of
about 5 p.c.
“Australians are using a much greater
volume of smooth floorcoverings than
soft, but they are spending nearly twice
as much on soft floorcoverings than on
smooth since soft floorcoverings repre-
sent a higher price per square yard. We
anticipate some reduction in the margin
on volume used of smooth floorcoverings
against soft as the rising standard of
living tends to encourage greater use
of the latter.”
When questioned about the failure of
the felt floorcovering industry in Ame-
rica, the executive said: “In the USA
felt floorcoverings have never acquired 1
the consumer acceptance they enjoy in
Australia. The main demand i Q
America is for carpets made on thd
tufted principle. These carpets consli
tute 70 p.c. of the present market of
soft floorcoverings in that country—the-
balance is mostly woven.
“Australians are wool minded and fell
floorcoverings made largely of this fibrj
have occupied a share of the floorcove:

will continue to command a share o

tent and the value for the outlay o
money spent. Conditions in Australia-
wool-producing country are moi
favorable to the production of woollei
floor felt than those that prevail in Amt
rica, where wool is relatively scarce.
“The future of the Australian floor-
covering industry is bright. There shoui
be a steady increase in floorcoverinJ
use because of the influences of a large
population trend and an improvir

for the floorcoverings industry,” sa

Company Meeting
PRESIDENTIAL ADDRESS TO THE AUSTRALIAN
INDUSTRIES DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
ANNUAL MEETING, 26th MAY, 1964
By Mr. B. G. ROSS
DEVELOPMENT
In my last year’s presidential address, I
stressed the need for the Government to
promote vigorously the development of Aus-
tralia. There have been welcome signs fol-
lowing on from the last Federal election and
the policies on which the Government
successfully based their campaign that a
more positive approach is being made. There
has been, for example, the new Division of
Northern Development to plan and co-ordin-
ate developmental works in northern Aus-
tralia. There has been the establishment of
a Directorate of Industry in the renamed
Department of Trade and Industry. We hope
eventually that there will be a Minister for
Manufacturing Industry. It is to be hoped
that this positive approach extends also to
the Tariff Board and that, as A.I.D.A. has
so often stressed, the tariff will be used as a
major weapon to ensure the healthy opera-
tion and continuing growth of manufacturing
industry. We would also compliment the
Government on their continuing policy of
consultation with industries in matters of
vital importance to industry and the
economy.
It Is ; however, more than just a few specific
activities that is needed. It is a general
attitude of the need to press on urgently and
continuously with the growth and develop-
ment of all aspects of the economy. The
Government has now indicated that it is
seeking a 5 per cent annual increase in the
gross national product. We think that this
figure is too low. However, we agree that
it is better to have a goal of 5 per cent than
no goal at all.
The fear complex of some timid souls, who
are afraid of an expanding c o.cauS

economic restrictions. It would be “1
congruous for the Government to restrict
level of activity just when the economy
righted itself. . J
We believe that overseas investment ,
Australia should be encouraged where it "
result in the development of our natura l
sources or the introduction of new teehnj
processes and skills. There seems to be n
point, however, In allowing foreign invest


tiles in Australia had been “dramatic”
and that it was expected to continue.
“The growth rate has been high because
vinyl as a floorcovering has made in-
roads into the sales of other types of
covering. The rate of expansion in the
future, now that vinyl has become estab-
lished, will depend to a large extent on
growth of population.”
The executive remarked that imported
vinyl coverings had affected the Austra-
lian industry. “About 1961-62, imports
made severe inroads into the Australian
market. Their chief selling advantage
was the range of colors and lower prices.
We dropped our prices and introduced a
wider range to beat them. And this cut
them back to a more reasonable level.
Present tariff's are 35 p.c. MFN and
25 p.c. British preference.
“Another reason imports have been
reduced is that the Australian industry
can produce anything that overseas
manufacturers can.”
Speaking on raw materials, the execu-
tive said the price of PVC (polyvinyl-
chloride) resins was lower this year be-
cause the Commonwealth Government
had introduced bounties on the resins.
Another raw material, asbestos fibre, had
also been reduced in price. The price
of limestone filler had been fairly static.
“One of the reasons for the growth
of the vinyl tile industry is increasing
use in the home. Apart from being used
in areas like the kitchen and bathroom,
tiles are also being used in other rooms
in the home because of their decorative
value. They find increasing application
in office buildings where inroads have
been made on linoleum.”
The executive said local competition
was very active, with nine manufacturers
in the field. “This has had a good effect
on the industry, where everybody is
striving to keep one jump ahead of his
rivals to produce a new and better pro-
duct. All the manufacturers, too, have
assisted in the promotional effort.”
The executive claimed that the price of
vinyl tiles was being “continually re-
duced”. We are selling tiles today at
about half the price they were 10 years
ago. This has been caused by the en-
larged demand. The increasing use of
PVC for other products has caused a
price drop and that has also caused a
reduction in the price of tiles.
“p° R the future we expect the vinyl tile
to maintain its share of the Austra-
lian market, and it will grow as the mar-
ket grows. There is almost no limit to
the range of patterns that can be made
so there will be development in this field.
New patterns will be introduced as the
market demands them. There will also
be a reduction of the present surplus
capacity. Most manufacturers at the
moment are working well below their
capacity.
“Because of this situation and the con-
sequent competition, there will not be
any great incentive for new manu-
facturers to start up, the executive
observed.
The general feeling among floorcover-
ings importers is that their present
market will grow. Although local manu-
facturers are all the time introducing
new patterns and colors to compete with
imports, they feel there will always be
a demand for imported coverings. An
executive of one importer, George Low
Pty Ltd, which imports carpet from
Scotland, India and China and linoleum
from England, said it was pointless to
import Axminster carpets “because the
local manufacturers have got the price
right and produce a carpet similar in
quality to any overseas manufacturer.
“Local manufacturers have progressed
a lot over the past few years, yet there
is still room for imported carpet. We
import mainly plain Wiltons because,
apparently, there is not a carpet of com-
parable quality made in Australia. A
few years ago we sold a lot of carpet
squares. Now it is nearly all broadloom.
“Because we are importers and not
manufacturers we have to be careful
about the types of carpet we import.
English and Australian tastes in carpet
differ widely and later this year we will
be receiving from Scotland colors we
have specially asked for.”
The executive said his company im-
ported a lot of patterned inlaid linoleum
which was not made here. “But we
would not consider importing vinyls.
It would be very difficult to get into the
field because of the number of people
already involved in it. And apart from
that there seems to be a definite trend
back to lino in the home and in public
buildings We think the import business
will go on. There are still a lot of people
who prefer to buy an imported carpet
and although we cannot look forward to
a great increase we can at least expect
to maintain our share of the business,”
the executive stated.
to acquire all or a majority interest in exist-
ing business, and perhaps a regulation should
prohibit this together with a regulation to
prohibit the distribution rights of manu-
factured products being restricted to Aus-
tralasia. Distributing rights should at least
include New Zealand and South-East Asia.
PRODUCTIVITY
If Australian industry is to expand and
make the use of limited resources, particularly
skilled workers, major emphasis must be
placed on increasing productivity. Manu-
facturing industry is faced with an acute
shortage of skilled workers, and there exists
a real challenge to manufacturing industry
to increase productivity. We should strongly
resist stealing skilled workers from each other
by bribing workers to transfer jobs.
Continuous increases in productivity are
essential if Australian products are to com-
pete in world markets, and also if Australian
living standards are to continue to rise. The
promotion of greater productivity must be
Pursued with vigour by management, by
workers, and also by the Government, and
ft must include all phases of activity whether
in the production (or extraction) of raw
materials, conversion of raw materials into
the complex range of products needed in a
modern society or the services essential to all
those other activities. Much of this quest for
greater productivity must be based on
indigenous research. It must also be based
°n the use of the best methods, the best
machinery, and the best training facilities
it is possible to provide.
IMMIGRATION
To assist in the exploitation of our natural
resources, development of industries, and to
People our continent more rapidly, Australia
must continue to increase its intake of
migrants and to increase its efforts to attract
migrants from all possible sources. We are
greatly concerned to learn that the percent-
age of skilled migrants is falling. A.I.D.A.’s
recent publication on “Capacity for Import
Replacement: An Analysis of Imports” has
highlighted the considerable idle capacity
which exists in a wide range of industries in
Australia. The use of this idle capacity could
•provide employment for some 100,000 more
workers in Australia without the need for
any extra investment expenditure. This offers
immediate and extensive scope for a consider-
able increase in immigration of workers in a
variety of capacities. However, many in-
dustrialists who are anxious and able to
recruit technicians and technologists overseas
cannot get housing for them.
DEFENCE
Australia’s best defence potential lies in
the building up and maintenance of a well-
balanced and technically advanced industrial
structure. Our industries must be capable
not only of producing machines and weapons
for war, but also of handling the highly com-
plex problems associated with the possible
combat of a nuclear war and of assisting our
allies therein.
This requires close co-operation between
the Services, Defence and Supply Depart-
ments, on the one hand, and Australian
manufacturers on the other hand, to ensure
availability of needed skills and equipment
in times of emergency. This co-operation
should range from research, planning and
design, through manufacture and servicing
of equipment so that industry may be geared
to supply what is needed for defence with as
little delay as possible.
In my presidential address last year, I
expressed the hope that manufacturing in-
dustry would benefit from the increase in
Government expenditure on defence. This
aspect has been discussed, and it would
appear that most of the additional expendi-
ture will be in rhe area of space and elec-
tronics. We were most interested and gratified
to learn of the excellent job being done by
the Commonwealth ordnance and ammunition
factories and to learn of the success that had
been achieved in the export to other
countries of defence equipment manufactured
in our own factories. With the increasing
emphasis being placed on more and more
complex and technical production methods
in all industries, primary, secondary and
tertiary, greater attention must be placed on
the training of technicians and workers.
This anplies to all grades of skill, and more
facilities are needed to ensure that all workers
have the opportunity to acquire the maximum
skills consistent with their ability. I do not
intend to speak on this subject at any length
because we are honoured todav to have as
our guest speaker Mr. Walter Scott, who is
much better qualified than I to tell you
about this subject. I could not let this
opportunity pass, however, without compli-
menting the Government on then decision
to make available the amount of five million
pounds per annum for science teaching. As
you all know, A.ID. A takes a very keen
interest in science teachin°r and w° welcome
this further assistance from the Common-
wealth Government.
RESTRICTIVE TRAT>F PRACTICES
Finally, I want to reiterate A.I.D.A.’s warn-
ing in respect of the proposed legislation on
restrictive trade practices. We are concerned
this legislation should turn out to be
as it is named, that is, restrictive of enter-
prise and opportunities for investment in in-
dustry. We strongly urge the Government to
ensure that the measure is confined to par-
ticular practices which are regarded as
objectionable in clearly defined circumstances.

The importance of Mortgage Protection
Like most people, you have probably arranged a mortgage
to finance the ownership of your home, and have arranged
to pay it off from future earnings over ten, fifteen or more
years.
There is, of course, no problem so long as you can continue
your repayments. But what if you were no longer here? If
death were to strike too early? Could your wife take up the
obligation without hardship?
You have, no doubt, protected your home with fire insurance,
and almost certainly you have taken out a life assurance
policy to provide for your family’s financial security.
These are not always enough.
If your wife should be left with the responsibility of your
new home and its mortgage, she would indeed be helped by
those other safeguards in the way of assurance, savings or
stocks and shares. But she would need them for the
children’s education, and for security in later years. They
would probably not cover the mortgage repayments as well.
There is an inexpensive—extremely valuable—answer:
CUSTOMLIFE PLANNED MORTGAGE PROTECTION POLICY.
This plan costs little, and is best explained by example:
A man, 34 years of age, is committed to repay, say, £2O per
month for the next 20 years—a total of £4,800 over the
period.
CE Lid
!TE
He could cover this responsibility by taking out a £1,200
Mortgage Protection Plan, with payments of a monthly
premium of only £3.8.0.
Benefits:
Should he die within the period of 20 years, his widow would
receive the following immediate payments during the years as
listed, and this amount would always cover the reducing
mortgage.
Ist Year—£4,Boo
2nd Year—£4,62o
3rd Year—£4,44o
4th Year—£4,26o
sth Year—£4,oBo
6th Year—£3,9oo
7th Year—£3,72o
Bth Year—£3,s4o
9th Year—£3,36o
10th Year—£3,lBo
11th Year—£3,ooo
12th Year—£2,B2o
13th Year—£2,64o
14th Year—£2,46o
15th Year—£2,2Bo
16th Year—£2,loo
17th Year—£l,92o
18th Year—£l,74o
19th Year—£l,s6o
20th Year—£l,3Bo
Thus, at the end of 20 years, when the mortgage is cleared,
the Sum Assured would still be £1,200, plus all bonuses added
over the period. This policy then continues as a Whole of
Life Policy and the premium is then reduced to £2.15.0 per
month.
Customlife Mortgage Protection Plan can be varied to meet
your particular needs. Contact us to have one of our quali-
fied consultants call to discuss it with you.

MARKET POINTERS
Buyers Aren’t Hustling Yet
Chare prices on the Australian stock
exchanges remained listless last week
and, despite various theories advanced
by brokers, it was plain that buyers just
weren't interested in the market at the
moment.
Dr Coombs’ warnings on more re-
strained growth made them wonder if
further restrictions were likely.
Except for isolated items of stimulus,
like Burns, Philp’s one-for-four bonus,
investors found no real incentive to
hustle them into share buying.
There was evidence of a lift of £8.6
million during April to £476.4 million
in Australian savings bank loans for
home construction. But dampening this
was the report that the Reserve Bank
wanted the banks to tone down home
loans because of the pressures on the
building industry.
Also, there was talk that imports
were quickening. With interest rates ris-
ing and a traditionally tight period ex-
pected in May - June, investors
seemed to think that all this “liquidity”
was more in the hands of the institutions
than the average man-in-the-street. Even
the short-term money market reflected a
definite slackening of funds.
★ ★ ★
TVjllness in the share market also
induced a cautionary influence on
investors with spare cash. Several people
admitted last week they had money avail-
able, but they were wondering if the mar-
ket would recede further.
Particularly did this apply to sugar
stocks.
In a way, we were glad there was a
shakeout in sugar, because we received
some rude comments some time ago
when we sounded a note of caution on
sugar prices.
★ ★ ★
about depressing prices,
nothing could be more depressing
than the oil market at the moment.
Planet Oil took a caning when the
company announced a Is. call and a
new issue of one-for-one.
Those who want to use calls on oil
mining stocks as a claim for tax deduc-
tions no doubt would find Planet cheap
at such prices. If there is anything
which develops at a later stage, the
current buyer is so much better off than
those who paid premium prices earlier
in this company’s career.
★ ★ ★
'C'xoil NL is another oil exploration
company which made shareholders
blink when it announced that it was
forming a £2% million subsidiary oil ex-
ploration company, Transoil NL. Exist-
ing shareholders of Exoil will be able to
op ply for one ss. Transoil share for every
two shares held.
Transoil shares will be paid to Is. on
application and the directors indicate that
no further calls will be made before
January 15.
As a promoting company, Exoil itself
gets a million ss. shares paid to Is., on
which future calls will be credited without
payment.
Exoil also gets an option over a further
one million shares, because Transoil gets
the right to participate in 30 p.c. of
Exoil’s future Australian exploration
ventures.
The deed is a smart way of raising
extra money without placing the burden
squarely on Exoil shareholders, who are
liable for further calls totalling 3s. a
share. If Exoil shareholders don’t want
to take up shares in Transoil, they can
dip out.

INVESTMENT SECTION
Shareholders vs. Placements
*TV) date, 1964 has seen an increasing
tendency for companies to make
share placements instead of, or as well
as, issuing to shareholders. G. J. Coles
•made a placement just before its an-
nouncement of the one-for-ten sharehol-
ders’ issue. A fortnight ago Cresco Fer-
tilizers, of Adelaide, decided to issue to
a life company as well as to the share-
holders. On Wednesday of last week
two Melbourne companies Hoadley’s
the confectionery manufacturer, and
Walter Wright, haulier and engineer
announced placements with no equiva-
lent benefits to shareholders.
One of the main reasons for this trend
is the fact that placement scrip is gene-
rally able to carry a higher premium than
that loaded onto any shareholders’ issue.
It can go out at a price which is usually
only Is. or 2s. lower than the market.
Issues to shareholders, on the other hand,
usually create great complaint unless
there is a decent sort of margin for pro-
fits to be made between the issue price
and that on the stock market.
So, through placements, a company
can raise a certain amount of money
with a smaller increase in paid capital
than would result if shareholders’ finance
was called on. The extra costs of a
shareholders’ issue cannot be sniffed at
either. This usually involves rights
trading and mountains of paper work
with scrip issuing and transferring.
The Walter Wright issue should not
be too detrimental to the shareholders’
interests. It will lift paid capital by only
£25,000 (100,000 ss. shares at an un-
disclosed premium which is probably
around 2s. 6d.) and as profits are on the
upturn this year, earnings should be
maintained. It should be remembered
that a placement also eliminates, to a
large extent, the need to explain to share-
holders exactly what will be done with
the money. In this case they probably
would have been rather unhappy about
parting with their money, as it will not
be used for expansion but to finance
additions and replacements to the vehicle
fleet.
The Hoadley’s proposition is different,
however. In the annual report issued
near the end of March the chairman, Mr
J. L. Hewison, said an increase in share
capital may have to be considered to
counteract a weakening liquid position
which had arisen because of heavy capi-
tal expenditure on new factory premises,
plant and expansion of business. Al-
though he qualified this statement to
indicate that this did not necessarily
mean a scrip benefit to shareholders, the
shares still crept to a near record of
225. 6d. during subsequent weeks.
Some shareholders will not be disap-
pointed by the decision to place 240,750
ss. shares at 18s. Unlike many place-
ments, this one will not go to any one
body, but to the clients of J. B. Were &
Son at 18s. plus brokerage.

provision as to the assets-liability ratio
when a considerable loss was incurred
on trading in the December, 1963, half-
year, and when write-offs were made on
the investment in Gippsland Acceptance
Ltd.
Recommendations to be submitted at
the meeting include submission of
monthly trading figures and relevant
reports on Harco to the trustee or a
chartered accountant, and submission to
the trustee of group accounts within four
months of the close of the financial year.
The manager of the trustee company
(Mr V. G. Southall) pointed out in the
circular to Harco noteholders that if
Harco can achieve budgeted results (a
profit of over £42,000 a year) precipitate
action by the trustee in issuing a writ
for repayment of notes, principal and
interest may not be in their best interests.
Budgets supplied to the trustee show
an estimated group turnover of £420,000
a year, compared with actual turnover
in 1962-63 of £400,000.
Unofficial ~ notification from the
Metropolitan Water, Sewerage and
Drainage Board in Sydney that Harco
had won a five-year contract worth
£376,000 and other orders for £50,000
form the basis of directors’ confidence
that they can, under the new manage-
ment, return the company to profitability.
Bad Marks for Foy’s
TSLfiDELY divergent quotes of ss. buyer
and Bs. 6d. seller, after a previous
sale of Bs. 9d., reflected the market’s
disappointment with Mark Foy’s continu-
ing difficulties.
Heavy asset backing per ss. share
(12s. 4d. at last reckoning) and an
absence of serious liquidity problems
account for existing shareholders’ reluc-
tance to part easily with the shares.
In the year to February 29, the com-
pany earned a net £53,376 after no tax
provision. Directors were anxious not
to pay out more than the company
earned (although it had in the two pre-
vious years), so dividend was cut from
12i p.c. to 6 2 p.c.
Directors are still hopeful that results
for the current year will allow a sub-
stantial restoration in the dividend rate.
Rentals from surplus freeholds will pro-
vide more than £lOO,OOO this year, and
new branch stores at Double Bay, Rock-
dale and Eastwood will trade for the full
period.
Upgrading Titanium
11/'estern Titanium NL is planning
" considerable increase in output.
Talks were being held with large over-
seas companies with the object of form-
ing a new company to handle the bene-
ficiation process on a commercial scale,
the chairman, Mr K. A. Cameron, told
the annual meeting.
Beneficiation will allow the ore to be
upgraded from a 56 p.c. titanium oxide
content to 86 p.c. on average. Results
of a plant-scale test by Du Pont are of
great importance.
If the company achieves a partnership
venture to establish the nation’s first
commercial ilmenite beneficiation plant,
Western Titanium would be a big share-
holder.
Output of Western Titanium is this
year being expanded from 113,000 tons

placement of £150,000. There was an
earlier notes placement of £200,000 in
January. The latest issue has a cur-
rency of only 12 months, suggesting the
company only needs temporary accom-
modation.
Malleys has recently invested about
£500,000 in purchasing a 26 p.c. interest
in SA Enamels (Holdings) Ltd and a
50 p.c. interest in Hudson and West Pty
of Sydney.
Supported by Whirlpool Corporation
of the US (which owns 134 p.c. of capi-
tal), and a favorable economic situation,
Malleys is gathering strength on the
stock market. Profits in the first eight
months of the year to June were con-
siderably better than in 1962-63. Interim
dividend was raised to an annual rate
of 9 p.c.
Woe from Benjamin
An alarmingly low rate of gross profit
in the Ryde store was the major
cause of a loss by A. J. Benjamin Ltd
exceeding the Receiver's expectations.
The loss totalled £115,174 for the half-
year to February 28, compared with a
budgeted £75,000.
Certain expenses, some associated with
the Receiverships on the parent company
and two subsidiaries (at Ryde and
Broken Hill), exceeded budget and con-
tributed to the increased loss.
The Broken Hill store operated with-
out loss. The Chatswood store accounts
for 60 p.c. of group assets and the
Receiver (Mr D. Davidson) said its dis-
posal would determine the actual return
to creditors.
No proposal was received for take-
over of the group as a whole. The
reasons put forward by Mr Davidson
were the magnitude of the assets (£3
million), the geographical location of
various businesses, and the fact that
building materials do hot naturally go
with general departmental store trading.
Proceeds of the sale of assets of the
Ryde store and “Jamboree’’ restaurant,
Willoughby North building centre and
the Campbelltown store were £530,000,
which will be applied to repayment of
bank borrowings.
Collections on book debts from the
stores and building centre which were
sold will be made over a period of
years.
Losses are continuing in the Blake-
hurst and Hillsdale Junior Department
store.
Isas (NSW) Revives
Tsas (NSW) Ltd, the earthmoving and
construction equipment distributor,
has pulled itself out of the mire, thanks
to a general improvement in the eco-
nomy. The bad debts problem experi-
enced in recent years is therefore dimi-
nished.
Earning rate for 1963-64, at 13.3 p.c.,
is about on a level with that earned in
the year to March, 1961. However, the
dividend rate is only 8 p.c., compared
with 10 p.c. in the earlier year, and
5 p.c. and 74 p.c. in 1962 and 1963.

Manufacturing roofing tiles, roofing

other tiles in Ballarat (Vic.), the com-
pany distributes throughout the country
districts of Victoria, SA, NSW and the
ACT. Last week the company announced
that a final dividend of 4 p.c. would
be paid—this suggests a return to the
full 8 p.c. distribution of the pre-squeeze
1960 year.
Full payout for the latest year will
total 64 p.c. (a 24 p.c. interim has
already been distributed). This compares
with 5 p.c. last year. Although the
year's financial results have yet to be
released, it seems definite that a size-
able profit increase is at hand.
This is not only evidenced by the
increased dividend. It must be remem-
bered that the payout is also being made

From Uranium to Bauxite?
TTnited Uranium NL expects value of
production of uranium oxide to be
about £575,000 in 1964, allowing a fur-
ther dividend to be paid this year.
Production to fulfil the UK Atomic
Energy Authority contract should be
complete by July, directors said in their
report accompanying 1963 accounts.
The directors believe that uranium
mining operations may be resumed in
the early 1970 s and that it is necessary
for the company to have the potential
to develop adequate ore reserves.
With this objective they acquired
Northern Territory uranium mining titles
and plant from South Alligator Uranium
NL and spent £134,205 in 1963 on
exploration for and development of
uranium oxide on those leases.
When the uranium milling programme
is completed, the company means to
treat a quantity of gold-bearing mill
residues, which should occupy plant for
a year and yield a reasonable profit.
In pursuit of other minerals than
uranium, the company has applied to
the Commonwealth Government for lease
of 22 square miles on the Gove penin-
sula bauxite deposits in the NT, where
it may be possible to establish an
alumina plant and smelter.
United Uranium is partnered by Con-
solidated Mining and Smelting Co. of
Canada Ltd in this project.

-£158,925 loss. Cryer had been pro-
ducing greeting cards for over 30 years.
An increasing number of competitors,
backed by American technical skill and
assistance, furnished the basis for its
recent decision to vacate that field in
favor of general printing and pressure
sensitive products.
Before the preliminary announcement
on trading for 1963-64, directors had
attributed the “limited profits for the
past three years . . . directly to the
greeting card field'’. (Cryer made a
loss in 1959-60 and modest profits only
in the two succeeding years.)
There had been no indication in pre-
vious annual reports and chairman’s

A Little Reid Murray
HPhe sale of the name and goodwill of
Webbs Radio and Electrical Pty Ltd
to an unidentified English concern will
do absolutely nothing for the creditors
and shareholders in the other companies
of the W. A. Peterson group. In fact,
it will probably only lift the 4s. in the £
which Webbs’ creditors are expected to
receive by a few shillings.
The cessation of trading by Webbs
means all Peterson’s activities have now
come to a halt. The holding company,
Webbs/Webbs Development and W. A.
Peterson Securities have all been under
an official Receiver and manager since
the beginning of May. Creditors actu-
ally put Webbs under official manage-
ment in May last year after deficiencies
of £200,000 were discovered.
At present the Receivers do not plan
to liquidate the company. It will take
some time for the accounts to be straight-
ened out, for debts to be collected and
for the various moneys owed between
each member of the group to be figured.
The whole scheme could be fairly
described as “a little Reid Murray”. It
is hoped that the organisation will eventu-
ally sell its accumulated tax losses and
that the income from this will help
boost the percentage return which credi-
tors and debenture holders may receive.
It is a safe bet, however, that share-
holders will not be getting a bean.
Many sources predicted the collapse of
the group from the word go. Because
90 p.c. of the group’s electrical goods
sales were on either very low or no
deposit there was a heavy reliance on
an unknown source of outside finance.
This was cut out for a variety of rea-
sons in December, 1962, and turnover
dropped considerably despite a continued
heavy advertising campaign. Further
falls apparently showed up when a
number of the excellent sales staff which
had been gathered left what they con-
sidered to be a sinking ship.
And they were right. The rot had set
in well before Webbs lost its financial
backer. For instance, Wiles Manufac-
turing, of Adelaide, made a profit after
Peterson's had taken it over for the pur-
pose of tax losses and what was con-
sidered to be a “back door” listing. But
when the group decided to do some of
its own manufacturing through Wiles, a
bumper loss was recorded and it had to
be sold at a considerable capital loss.
Prosperity Through Holdens
Qydney Holden distributor, John A.
Gilbert Holdings Ltd, did not sur-
prise the professionals with its record
profit in the year to March 31.
However, an opportunist seller ap-
peared where there had been none for
days, offering shares at 19s. compared
with the buyers’ quote of 16s. lOd.
With profit for the first time exceed-
ing £200,000, the new earning rate will
be over 38 p.c., against 36.8 p.c. in
1962-63.
Moffat-Virtue Cheerless
Vet another loss was recorded by
engineer and machinery merchant
Moffat-Virtue Ltd in the financial and
calendar year 1963.
The loss of £25,938 was of the same
order as in 1962. Sales in 1963 increased
by 6 p.c.
Directors assert that when the muni-
tions annexe and surplus land are sold,
the company will be profitable. They
are keen to develop new lines as the
quickest means to higher turnover.
Neither preference nor ordinary
shareholders get a dividend- The debit
balance of profit and loss account is
now £51,050, although other reserves
of £223,375 support paid capital of
£276,799. (Property was written up by
£83,500 in 1962.)
The holding of the English partner in
J. A. Prestwick-Virtue Pty, an associate
company, has been bought out by
Moffat-Virtue. Directors believe this
will enable a clearance of certain stocks
and considerable reduction of investment.

Rewards from Electrical Equipment
A lthough there was no lack of working capital apparent
at last balance date, June 30, Electrical Equipment of
Australia Ltd is once again making a cash issue “to provide
additional working capital for the continuing expansion of
the business”.
Lucky shareholders, who have been recipients of a bonus
in 1959 and three other part issues in the last seven years,
should see no trimming of the new dividend rate either.
Interim dividend for the December six months was at an
annual rate of 131 p.c., compared with payments of 12 p.c.,
11 p.c., 101 p.c. and 10 p.c. in the years going back to 1960.
The ss. shares have moved up this year about 10s. to
245. 9d., where the income yield is a slim 2.7 p.c.
After the current one-for-nine issue at par, which inciden-
tally can't be a very economical procedure at this ratio, the
shares should average down to 225. 4d. Perhaps it is not
too much to hope that investors may find cheaper entry
later in the year.
VIA Dividend Doubts Dispersed
directors of VIA Ltd, the Melbourne-based timber
merchant, manufacturing engineer and office equipment
maker, have made a wise move in publishing a balance sheet
for the half-year to March 31. The original interim report
published on May 14 talked of a 7 p.c. sales increase and
the deferring of the interim dividend. This led many people
to believe that profitability was very low (see The Bulletin,
May 23, page 62) and threw doubts on the company’s divi-
dend-paying ability for the end of the year.
However, the half-yearly balance sheet has eliminated these
doubts and cast a more encouraging light on the prospects for
shareholders on the market price of their scrip. It shows a
net profit of £14,000 for the six months, compared with
£17,000 for the full 12 months to September 30 last. This
gives every reason to assume that last year’s 7 p.c. payout
(the first for two years) will be maintained in the current term.
If the half’s result is doubled, earning rate for the full year
is calculated at 12.6 p.c. This compares with 7.2 p.c. last
year a very narrow cover for the payout. This analysis
may not be completely valid, as the profit for the first half
of last year is not given for comparison with the £14,000.
Shareholders must just hope that the £14,000 is indicative of
the full result.
The balance sheet also casts away doubts on the working
capital position, which arose from the original report when
it said that dividend was being deferred to maintain liquidity
in view of the rising turnover. In actual fact, the balance sheet
shows that the figure increased from £251,000 to £314,000
during the half-year, mainly because of higher debtors and
stocks.
Financing the Oil Search
oil search has been a dismal failure over the past few
months. As a result, share prices are depressed and there
is little sign of the enthusiasm and optimism which once
prevailed. Even a big majority of speculators have moved
their funds to the more enticing sectors of the stock market.
Of course, this atmosphere is extremely unhealthy for those
companies which rely on making regular calls on their shares
in order to keep the drills biting into more of Australia’s “oil”
country. For this reason, it is hoped that the floating of
Iransoil and the one-for-one issue announced by Planet do
not signify the start of a new trend which the oil companies
will use to raise money —through “beneficial” share issues
instead of “unsavory” calls.
Basically, Transoil is purely a fund-raising body for Exoil.
Ten million ss. shares will be issued, paid to Is. This money
will finance a 30 p.c. interest in Exoil’s operations and do
nothing else. In other words, Exoil is raising more money
without making a call, although its shareholders will be
offered eight million of the units. Three of Transoil's four
directors are on the Exoil board, while the fourth is a director
of ODE -which sponsored Exoil’s original float in 1962.
To quote Mr C. W. Siller, chairman of the two companies,
“In providing a broader base through this affiliation, Exoil and
Transoil will have vastly increased resources from which to
call future capital requirements.” The whole scheme virtually
works out to be a call on Exoil shareholders as, unless they
wish to lose a 30 p.c. interest in operations to Transoil, they
must take up the eight million shares offered to them.
Planet’s one - for - one issue is also rather onerous.
Simultaneously, the final call of Is. on the present shares will
be made. This call must be paid before any entitlement can
be claimed to the nine million new shares. The whole deal
will raise over a half million pounds to finance an “immediate
increase in drilling activity”.
Property Developer Attracts
Successive dividends of 4 p.c., 51 p.c. and what looks like
6l p.c. for this year, with earnings giving very little
margin, may not look very exciting to the growth-conscious
investor, but Realty Development and Mortgage Co. Ltd
deserves further investigation.
Board members are directors also of Development Finance
Corporation, PGH, Brambles, Dickson Primer, Mercantile
Mutual Insurance, Perpetual Trustee, Kathleen Investment and
ether leading companies. Their know-how would be invaluable
to a young property owner and developer, preventing it from
any rash projects.
Jnterim dividend for the half-year to March 31 is 31 p.c.
Directors reported that trading ventures showed a marked
profit increase, while rentals w'ere in accordance with budget.
Some improvement can therefore be looked for on last year's
earning rate of 6.0 p.c.

It is a Mistake to Decry G. J. Coles
Good prospects from " super ” market leader
By ROGER RANDERSON
/'T J. Coles & Coy Limited, which over
a long period rightly earned the
reputation of treating its shareholders
most generously, has temporarily disap-
pointed the share market by announcing
a one-for-ten issue at 7s. 6d. (50 p.c.
premium) after a bonus issue to mark the
fiftieth anniversary of the business had
been hoped for.
The market has been further un-
settled by adverse criticism in some
quarters of the proposal to dispense
with traditional trading in rights for the
coming issue, although shareholders who
fail to subscribe to the new issue will
receive an amount representing the differ-
ence between 7s. 6d. and proceeds of
sale of new shares by the company on
their behalf.
This, at a time of broad generalising
about “profitless prosperity”, accounts
for the decline in the price of G. J. Coles’
ordinary ss. stock units from this year’s
high point of 19s. lid. to about 18s.
each.
Whether the recent marking down of
the shares is justified or not is one of
the questions that calls for considera-
tion in any review of the group's affairs
at the present time.
Already G. J. Coles, which employs
almost 19,000 people, is selling for cash
more than £lOO million of goods each
year through more than 600 outlets
strategically located across the continent,
including more than half in New South
Wales.
With the creation of “New World”
supermarkets to supplement its chain of
variety stores, the group is at present
enlarging the scale of its activities in a
phase of growth as impressive as any
previously in its history of ceaseless
expansion.
Capital, spread among 55,000 stock-
holders, will by September have been
increased to about £24,523,000.
A position of great financial strength
has been created, and is being main-
tained, largely because of sound reliance
on shareholders’ funds with limited
dependence on outside borrowings.
In every way, therefore, we are justi-
fied in considering G. J. Coles a true
stock exchange leader, combining the
attributes of size, regularity and extent
of share transfers to give negotiability
for its scrip, rapid growth and, not least,
stability.
Investors may need to be reminded
that each 10 shares held up to July 29
carry the right to subscribe 7s. 6d. by
September 30 for one additional share.
This means: that the average price of
a holding purchased at 18s. will be
reduced to 175.; that, if the dividend
rate is unchanged at 11 p.c., a high
dividend yield of li p.c. is offered on
the amount subscribed to the new issue;
and that the dividend yield on the
increased holding will become almost
3.3 p.c.
Existing shareholders, therefore, can
scarcely overlook the benefit from the
new issue, although they may still be
disappointed by having to wait longer
for a bonus issue, and they should
contrast the 7s. 6d. price to them for
additional shares with the price of
18s. 3d. charged in the recent private
placement of 570,000 shares.
However, this is the first premium
issue to shareholders since the one-for-
five issue of 260,000 shares of £1 par
value made at 50s. each in March, 1949.
Subsequent issues to shareholders have
been:
March 1950: Bonus 3 for 10
February 1951: Cash 1 for 2, par.
July 1954: „ 3 for 10, par
September 1955: „ 1 for 5, par
April 1957: Bonus 3 for 10
October 1957: Cash 3 for 10, par.
August 1959: Bonus 1 for 10
August 1961: Cash 3 for 10, par.
September 1964: „ 1 for 10,
2s. 6d. premium.
Long-run compensation for the pre-
mium issue to shareholders, besides the
recent private placement at a 260 p.c.
premium, lies in the fact that they en-
large the scope for a bonus issue in the
future.
“Premium on shares reserves” will be
increased by £1,479,685 to about
£6,353,296 following the private place-
ment and the coming issue to share-
holders.

£535,910 standing to the credit of
“Assets revaluation reserve” at last
balancing date, would accommodate a
two-for-seven bonus issue when earning-
power was deemed adequate to maintain
dividends.
This takes no account of possible
scope for revaluing some of the group’s
more than £25 million worth of free-
hold properties.
Directors have certainly deprived
shareholders of an important element of
discretion by deciding that the coming
issue, as with the 1957 cash issue, will
afford no “rights” for trading purposes.
On the other hand, shareholders fail-
ing to subscribe to the issue are likely
to receive as much in direct payment
from the company as if they had sold
rights on the open market.
Nevertheless, despite the precautions
taken in this instance to protect share-
holders, I doubt whether the small eco-
nomy achieved by the company suffici-
ently outweighs the adverse psycholo-
gical effects, and I should not like to
see any general departure in this direc-
tion from long-standing Australian
practice.
We now come to the company’s
earnings and dividends, which are the
essential keys to the analysis of invest-
ments.
Following the opening of ten “New
World” supermarkets for Christmas
trading, it is not surprising that directors
reported a satisfactory increase in sales
and profits for the first half of 1963-64.
Consolidation, involving the closing
down of small food stores and the
abandonment of wholesaling in New
South Wales, had been taking place in
the previous two years following the
acquisition of the Matthews Thompson
chain.
This, and one less operating week
than in the previous year, are estimated
to have deprived G. J. Coles of about
£4,200,000 of sales in 1962-63.
Nevertheless, actual sales results
showed a small increase of £818,483
to £98,287,100 for the year.
The company charged £956,942 for
depreciation and amortisation of plant
and leaseholds, which had cost about
£lB million, and it provided £2,293,030
for income tax, which was £101,070
more than in the previous year.
Stated net profit, after allowing for
the amount applicable to outside prefer-
ence shareholders, was £3,698,139, or
£402,533 more than in the previous year,
which is broadly reflected in the year’s
surplus after paying and providing for
dividends.
Earning rate on ordinary capital was
about 16.8 p.c., continuing the improve-
ment that has steadily been proceeding
since the low point of 13.7 p.c. was
reached in the 1958-59 year.
A promising sign is that net profit
as a proportion of turnover has recently
been restored to beyond its 1957-58 level,
which incidentally was the highest for the
post-war period.

Working capital, which had been
allowed to run down in the past two
years to assist in financing expansion,
has probably now been restored by the
receipt of proceeds from the private
placement of shares, besides the addi-
tional notes issued.
Liquidity, however, is scarcely a pro-
blem for such a business, which takes
into its tills the best part of £2 million
each week.
Stockholders, with funds of
£35,421,172, owned 65 p.c. of the com-
pany’s assets at last balancing date, and
the small amount of long-term liabilities
is an assurance against prior charges
raising embarrassing problems at times
when trading becomes difficult.
A tremendous reserve of inner strength
must lie in the company’s conservatively
valued freeholds.
Frankly, I cannot fault “Coles’ ” shares
at present prices. With earnings rising,
there should be ample benefits in the
future to reward patient holders.


SECURITY ANALYSIS
Blue Metal Industries’ Growth
Has the market learnt its lesson?
HThere are many reasons why compari-
sons between companies apparently
in the same industry may lead to wrong
conclusions, and comparisons of the
companies supplying crushed rock and
allied materials is no exception. Never-
theless, it is interesting to look at some
figures for some of the companies oper-
ating in the field when considering Blue
Metal Industries Ltd.
Blue Metal Industries’ activities seem
to be confined mainly to New South
Wales and it has large areas of quarry
land close to Sydney, Wollongong and
Newcastle. This closeness may well be
the key to its success because transport
costs are certainly of some importance
to the major operators, even though they
may make use of “leased” transport to
some considerable extent. During the
1962-63 year, quarries were acquired at
Dubbo and Wellington, together with
ready-mixed concrete plants at the same
places and also at Parkes and Forbes.
Also ready-mixed concrete plants were
acquired at Cessnock, Singleton, Doyal-
son and Gosford, which seems to suggest
that the group is now spreading out from
the Newcastle area where, according to
the 1962 report, activities were consoli-
dated during the 1961-62 year by the
acquisition of the Frost Development
Group, the CAM Ready Mixed Concrete
Group and L. H. Armstrong Co. Pty
Ltd.
The picture is changing somewhat but
there can be little doubt that the major
part of the group’s activities are still
centred in the Sydney area. Here, during
the 1961-62 year, Blue Metal Industries
reached an agreement with Ready Mixed
Concrete to market its ready-mixed con-
crete production through Ready Mixed
Concrete Industries Pty Ltd, a company
in which the two partners had equal in-
terests. However, Blue Metal & Gravel
Pty Limited the marketing subsidiary
for aggregate operates independently
from Australian Blue Metal, which is
the aggregate supplier of the Ready
Mixed Concrete group.
A nother activity which has been in the
news recently, with Esso’s acquisition
of the Allen Bros, group of companies
from PGH Industries, is the supply of
hot and cold mix bitumen for road sur-
facing. Blue Metal Industries appears
to be well established in this area through
Bitumenous Pavements Pty Ltd, which
not only supplies the material but also
undertakes the actual laying of the sur-
face. Having in mind the substantial
sums which the Federal Government
will allocate for road construction plus
moneys which will be provided by the
State and local government, it would
seem that these companies should have
an ever-increasing market for their pro-
ducts for some years to come.
Blue Metal Industries’ other activities
are perhaps more directly involved with
building and they include brickmaking,
the supply of timber and flooring, and
the supply and fixing of marble granite
and similar materials. This year it could
be expected that these divisions will do
very well, particularly as it is believed
that the face bricks produced by jClark
Kilns are highly regarded by Sydney
builders.
foregoing therefore points to a
-*• well-run and profitable group of com-
panies and at this stage it is appropriate
to make some comparisons on figures.
For this purpose the last five years have
been selected as they cover “boom” and
“recession” periods. The fact that all
the companies concerned have the same
par value for their shares makes price
comparisons possible in a direct fashion
and, without making any adjustments for
new issues, the following table shows the
prices at the end of the month in which
the accounts were presented.

From the absolute point of view, these
figures may be of interest but the follow-
ing indices of price, earnings and divi-
dends adjusted for new issues is much
more valuable. All figures are based on
the 1959 year = 100.

While the first three companies might
be described as “Sydney” companies, it
must be pointed out that Pioneer Con-
crete and Ready Mixed Concrete are
active in other States. The last three
companies are basically Melbourne com-
panies and the drop in earnings in these
companies is due mainly to local prob-
lems. Here it is interesting to note that
Reids Quarries has shown a much
stronger dividend growth than the other
two, although it must be admitted that
the dividend is now only just covered.
Perhaps the most interesting factor is
that up to the end of 1963 Pioneer Con-
crete's “price growth” had lagged behind
the growth in dividend income and the
growth in earnings, while in the case of
Blue Metal Industries the price had
finally exceeded the growth in earnings
but was still lagging behind the growth in
dividends.
TJowever, since this time the price of
Blue Metal Industries' shares has
risen to 26s., which means that the mar-
ket price index has now reached 141, in-
dicating that the price growth is now in
line with dividend growth and exceeds
earnings growth. Pioneer Concrete
shares, on the other hand, closed (prior
to going ex rights) at 16s. 6d., so the
price index will have only increased to
156, which is still less than the growth in
earnings and dividends without counting
the increase which should take place
from the bonus content of the current
rights issue.
These figures suggest to me that the
market prefers a stock where the current
dividend is covered over 1.7 times by
last year’s earnings to one where the
earnings will need to increase by 50 p.c.
to provide the same coverage. An exa-
mination of the indices shows that the
market preferred Ready Mixed Concrete
to Blue Metal Industries in 1960 and
1961 and on the basis of subsequent
price performance this was a mistake.
One can only assume that a lesson has
been learnt here.

BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS
Efficient Sugar Producer
Gibson and Howes also a grazier
\ hurricane in Cuba which destroyed
a quarter of that country’s sugar
harvest last year produced a peak price
of £stglos a ton of raw sugar on Lon-
don markets, late in October, 1964.
This was almost four times the price
prevailing a year or so before, hence the
excitement amongst investors in Austra-
lian sugar-producing companies.
Such a violent price variance is pos-
sible on the free market because only
about one-fifth of world sugar production
enters world trade. Most of this is sold
under special price arrangements.
Australian sugar production is limited
by quota based on domestic consumption
and available export markets, but Aus-
tralia is potentially the largest exporter
of sugar in the world.
The British Commonwealth Sugar
Agreement, under which Australia sup-
plies the UK at a negotiated price
(£stg46 os. lOd. per ton in 1963 and
1964), and Canadian and New Zealand
markets, has been extended to 1970.
This is the background of our export
trade.
Australia’s export quota under the
International Sugar Agreement is based
on a margin over her BCSA quota.
Australia has also concluded agreements
for the supply of considerable quanti-
ties of sugar to Japan over a three-year
period.
Although the free market price of
sugar has retreated to around £stgs6 a
ton, the efficient Australian industry will
continue to boom, particularly while
Cuba’s problems remain unresolved.
Against this background can be viewed
the performance of one of the Queens-
land producers, Gibson and Howes Ltd,
which mills cane at Bingera, near Bun-
daberg, that is grown on its own planta-
tions or by outside suppliers.
Its profit doubled from £154,942 to
£355,501, after providing £250,000 for
tax (1962 £112,00) and £120,546 for
depreciation (£94,817) in the year to
December 31, 1963, a pure reflection of
the unprecedented high sugar prices.
Final sugar price per ton 94 net titre
from No. 1 pool was estimated at
£6l 10s. and from No. 2 pool £69 155.,
compared with £53 os. 7d. and £36 2s.
respectively in 1962.
The crop harvested was affected by
severe frosts and low rainfall. None-
theless the 381,000 tons of cane crushed
and 58,520 tons of 94 NT sugar manu-
factured were the second highest on
record, exceeded only by 1962 figures.
Directors expect the tonnage for
crushing will be reduced this year by
reason of a dry growing season, while
rain is needed to assist the young cane
being planted for 1965. Since 1932 the
company has had irrigation facilities as
an insurance against poor rainfall.
Directors are investigating the irrigation
potential of all canegrowing areas supply-
ing the company’s mill.
The cane yield from the company’s
own plantation is consistently higher than
from independent suppliers, evidence of
company efficiency.
The Bingera mill peak of 39,000 tons
94 NT sugar was increased to 55,500
tons for 1964 season, with a projected
peak of 69,000 tons for 1966. If the
forecasts of the Sugar Industry Inquiry
Committee are correct, there is room
for expansion of manufacturing capacity
up to 1970.
During 1963 the company bought four
sheep and cattle properties in the Char-
leville district of Queensland, with a total
area of 278,000 acres. Consideration
was the issue of 150,000 fully-paid 20s.
shares at a considerable premium. This
grazing interest is a natural develop-
ment from its protein stock food business.
Neither Gowrie Pastoral Pty nor
Protein Stock Foods Pty remitted any
dividends to the parent company in 1963.
Their respective earnings for the 18
months to December were £30,856 and
£9793. Their balance dates are being
brought in line with the parent, but so
far their accounts are not consolidated.
They appear in the parent balance sheet
only as £158,581, shares in subsidiaries.
In December, 1963, a one-for-three
bonus lifted capital to £1,040,000, sup-
ported by reserves of £900,567. The
previous such benefit was a one-for-two
bonus in September, 1954.
Dividend of 15 p.c. including 3 p.c.
bonus) was paid on the bonus-enlarged
capital. Earning rate on final capital
was 34.2 p.c. in 1963.
At 61s. 6d. the 20s. shares currently
afford an income return of 4.9 p.c., and
an earnings yield of 11.3 p.c. The price-
earnings ratio of 8.8 is significantly
shorter than at a similar time of year in
the preceding four years considering the
strength of the industry’s prospects and
the company’s capacity and reserves, the
shares are not unduly high.

WUNDERLICH LTD
Pipe Venture Blots Image
rpHE chairman of Wunderlich Ltd
(Mr C. Wunderlich) made a plea
in his 1964 annual address for rationali-
sation of building codes and regulations
as a means of lowering building costs.
A multiplicity of ordinances and regu-
lations, many outdated, control building
industry practice, said Mr Wunderlich.
If the beneficial research which various
organisations have carried out were in-
corporated in new codes, major econo-
mies could be effected in the use of build-
ing materials.
While most builders would endorse this
opinion, consumers would not appreci-
ate the suggestion for standardisation of
the building product range, because our
relatively small population means high
research and development costs and a
rapid rate of product obsolescence.
Mr Wunderlich referred to the return
to prominence of developmental build-
ing projects, a high current level of
building approvals, and Government
financial assistance to home purchasers
(offset by an increase in bank lending
rates). He said Australia w’as again
entering a period of great activity in
building works—commercial, industrial
and domestic.
As a manufacturer of building pro-
ducts of metal, asbestos cement, cera-
mics and plastic, Wunderlich has been in
business since 1888. Listed in 1908, it
has an excellent reputation for consistent
profits and dividends.
It has plants throughout Australia,
seven in NSW, four in Victoria, two in
SA, three in Queensland and two in Tas-
mania, and a substantial share interest
in H. L. Brisbane and Wunderlich Ltd,
a parallel business in WA. Excess of
market value over book value of this
particular investment was £400,000 at
1964 balance date.
The only sign of diversification has
been in a £3 million joint venture with
Humes Ltd to make and market asbestos
cement pipes. This, so far, has caused
Wunderlich a lot of headaches. In the
year to October, 1963, Wunderlich
Humes Asbestos Pipes Pty lost £297,436,
bringing the accumulated loss tally to
£507,265.
The equity capital involved, £500,000,
has been written dow'n in 1963-64 by
£300,000, being a transfer from reserves,
and, together with amounts advanced,
the investment stood in the books on
February 29, 1964, at £630,000.
Wunderlich admits to production
problems and competition from all types
of pipes. The future is still obscure, al-
though every effort is being made to
rectify the position. (Losses now are at
a lower rate.)
As the pipe business is not a subsidiary
the trading losses are not reflected in
group profit and loss account, which
showed an advance over the previous
year of only £3750 to £313,824. Tax
provision was down from £251,000 to
£228,000, but depreciation was up from
£335,492 to £343,406.
Earning rate gained a point from 16.6
p.c. to 16.7 p.c., but it is significantly
lower than the usual 19 p.c. or 20 p.c.
which was the rule before the recession
hit the building industry so deliberately.
The company is pleased with the im-
proved demand (in the latter part of the
year) for terra-cotta roofing tiles, alumi-
nium windows and sliding doors. De-

Maryhorough’s Recovery
Js Maryborough Knitting Mills on the
way to complete recovery? It took
a severe fall in 1960-61, when earnings
fell from a near record 23.5 p.c. to 17.0
P-c. In 1962, earnings lapsed again to
15.6 p.c., but last year they moved up
slightly to touch 16.1 p.c. In the latest
year to March 31, a considerable im-
provement was scored to just more than
20 pc.
There seems to be little reason why
this trend should not continue in the
current year. Whatever happens, there
ls no reason for shareholders to worry
over their 12} p.c. dividend, which was
paid right through the difficult 1961,
1962 and 1963 years.
One of the keys to future earnings
undoubtedly lies in what the directors
m ake of La Mode Holdings, if their
Proposed takeover of the company is
approved at an extraordinary meeting to
be held ‘ ‘as soon as possible”. La Mode
°n its own has proved to be a dismal
jlop- The problem will be for Mary-
borough to make enough use of its
acquisition to maintain, or preferably
mcrease, its earnings on capital which
be higher if the takeover is success-
ful.

SPECULATOR’S DIARY
Remembrance of Things Past
Looking at 1960 before diving into today
Q*ome days ago, I happened to come
across the financial page of a paper
dated March 19, 1960. Although this
find was completely accidental, it
seemed a worthwhile exercise to note
the changes in the market that have
taken place over the four years. (Re-
member that there has been only a
slight change in the index in that period.)
First of all there were the outstanding
collapses. Here we had Reid Murray at
155., Stanhill at 20s. 10d., and Chevron
Sydney showing a price of 7s.
Then there was the group of com-
panies whose market status has some-
what slipped. Leading the field came
Federal Hotels at 12s. 10d., closely
followed by Carrier Air at 225. 9d.,
then in a bunch H. C. Sleigh at 18s. 3d.,
Electronic Industries at 255. 9d. and
Moulded Products at 225. 9d.
Unfortunately most of the other well-
known shares also saw better days in
1960 than they are seeing at the moment.
This even includes the market giant,
BHP, which at 81s. was higher (after
adjustment for the intervening issues)
than today’s price of 565.
What looks even more disheartening
for the long - term investor is. the
relatively few rises by the acknowledged
leaders of that day. Newspapers and
banks are the exception.
On- this business of long-term invest-
ment, you may remember I matched
my portfolio at the end of November
against one prepared by the “Financial
Review” of the same date. Although
a much better test will be a comparison
six months from now in November, I’ll
make an interim (and probably biased)
judgment on these portfolios next week.
One share in my portfolio last year
was Gibson & Howes. From the
November price of 655., it had gone
crazily up to 755., only then to react
back to 625. The dry season in the
southern part of Queensland could
well lead to a smaller crop this year,
and so a lower profit. So perhaps the
fall is justified.
But this would not seem to be the
case with Pioneer Sugar. First of all it
showed the most impressive increase
in profits of all the millers almost a
200 p.c. rise to give an earning rate of
82 p.c. on the bonus-enlarged capital.
Now, with the expansion programme
well under way, the company expects to
increase production of sugar from
159,000 tons last year to 189,000 tons
this year.
In recent weeks, the world sugar price
has fallen to about £stgss. This drop
was apparently caused by the Italians’
reluctance to buy sugar on the market,
although they are still short of their
requirements. That, of course, is purely
a short-term factor. More important is
the fact that the price is not expected
to alter materially over the next year
or so.
Thus it would not be too much to
expect Pioneer Sugar to earn over 100
p.c. to capital this year. In fact, already
the optimists are getting set for another
l-for-5 bonus issue. With such a
promising background, it’s hard to
understand why the shares should sell'
at 745. 6d. one day and a few days later,
be marked down to 655. and still be
cum a Is. dividend. I settled for 200.
It was also on a price reaction that'
I bought 500 A. J. Dawson at 12s. They
had been 12s. 9d. only two days before.!
Formed in 1945, Dawson operates as'
a manufacturer of automotive equip- [[
ment, specialising in brake linings and p
electrical work. Considering the fluctua-
tions in the automotive industry, it has ii
done very well over the years. (
Some little time since I shorted! This c
week I broke the spell by selling 2000
Pioneer Concrete rights at 2s. 6d. a
Volume so far has been low and they
could sink very quickly when the r
renunciations forms hit the market J
Under 2s. they become a good buy. c
Other selling this week was the final' !
200 Mt Isa at 40s. 9d. and 500 General
Industries at 9s. 6d. A blow to the f
ego, with both showing losses. Oi'
greater magnitude was the £7O loss on
500 of Aeron. This made it just too r
much to take so I found temporary c
relief by selling 500 of my Hanimex a
a profit of £ll5. I’m still expecting bit
things from this veteran. ■
Transactions for the week were: }

THE MAN
ON THE LAND
Nightmares Stalk the Land
Farmers haunted by probate and death duties
slJFhen men on the land have bad
: " dreams it is more than likely that
The most nightmarish figure of all is
PROBATE AND DEATH DUTIES,
wi At the recent half-yearly general meet-
ing of the National Farmers’ Union, in
Melbourne, probate and death duties
f came under strong attack.
The attack was on both the emotional
and the statistical level.
: Mr B. A. N. Cole, a South Australian
representing the Australian Wool and
i Meat Producers' Federation, spoke of the
country being “depopulated and perish-
ing and sons of farmers being forced to
: leave the land” because of heavy pro-
bate and death duties based on land
valuations which were “quite absurd’’.
He had it on good authority from
medical men that mental illness and
. anxiety in country areas was at a high
| level.
The cause was probate. ■
Tf it continues, everyone will be living
in a few big cities made out of glass,”
he said.
Leading the attack on the less color-
ful basis of an economy being jeopardised
I because of probate was Mr S. Ick
i Hewins, representing the Australian
i!-Woolgrowers’ and Graziers' Council,
i On matters relating to wool marketing
, ' s very rarely that a Wool and Meat
Producers’ man and a Graziers’ man
: see eye to eye.
But in this discussion there was no
disagreement.
Mr Ick Hewins, a deft and penetrating
speaker, said that aCthe back of many
People’s minds might be the matter of
closer settlement.
Might not many people believe that
existing probate duties were an effective
Wa y of breaking up the large estates?
All that is asked,” he said, “is that
Governments, and certainly that in New
South Wales, proceed sanely and fairly
w hh closer settlement.”
H land had to be taken, then it should
be by the rule of compensation. Tax
S'ould be paid on the compensation
! rcce ived. But land should not be ex-
P r °priated to pay death duties.
He suggested that there should be a
I re bate of 45 per cent on that part of the
estate used for primary production, re-
gardless of the final balance of the
estate.
South Australia and Victoria had
already made moves in the right direc-
tion?
In SA there was a rebate of 30 per
cent if the total succession was not more
than £20,000. There was a declining
scale for larger successions.
In Victoria there was a flat rebate of
30 per cent.
Because of probate duties it was a
common experience that land had to be
sold to raise the duty.
Such sales broke the continuity of farm
ownership, subdivision resulted in the
loss of productive efficiency, landholders
were deterred from ploughing back
money into a property that would be
taken from them, and the economics of
wide areas were thrown into confusion.
Mr Ick Hewins said that the Common-
wealth Government could adopt a prin-
ciple on probate duties which would
simplify the task of getting complemen-
tary action in the States.
The NFU, following the lengthy dis-
cussion, decided that it would prepare a
case “for amendment of the Estate Duty
Assessment Act by the introduction of
a rebate upon that portion of the value
of the total estate as is attributable to
land used for primary production”.
The case, to be prepared in detail so
that there are no loopholes, will be sent
to the Commonwealth Government.
What are the loopholes?
Mr R. J. McAuley, representing the
Woolgrowers’ and Graziers’ Council
with Mr Ick Hewins, mentioned two
which he termed “inhibitions”.
One was that probate insurance was
now a big part of the 30 per cent of
insurance company funds required to be
put into Government loans.
Another was the fear that easier pro-
bate would encourage city businessmen
to buy up properties at inflated prices to
the detriment of genuine primary pro-
ducers.
For these reasons the case must be
prepared with great care and in such a
way that it could not be open to rebuttal.
Two speakers said they thought the
plan might have a better chance of
acceptance by the Government if a limit
of £lOO,OOO was put on the property
value. Also, the rebate should be re-
stricted to a widow and her children.
Nephews, uncles and so on should be
excluded.
The NFU will consider all these points.
This is an area in which the NFU can
do the most good. In matters of general
farm policy it functions well, with repre-
sentation from most of the major farm
organisations, with the notable exception
of the Australian Primary Producers’
Union.
However, there is under way a plan for
possible amalgamation of the NFU and
the APPU. Should it succeed, farming
generally must benefit.
The ultimate goal of an NFU in line
with the British NFU that is an all-
supreme farmers’ voice—may be a long
way off. Clearly it is difficult for, say,
a canegrower in Queensland and a dairy-
farmer in Tasmania to have a common
outlook on a specific farming problem.
But at the top policy-making level the
NFU can do much. As it is due soon
to shift its headquarters from Sydney to
Canberra its influence is likely to grow.
Another Wool Board Critic
Mr F. E. Hitchins re-enters the fray
As a critic of the Australian Wool
Board Mr F. Eric Hitchins, of
Cranbrook in Western Australia, pulls no
punches.
He says that the policies of both the
Wool Board and the International Wool
Secretariat are in need of overhaul.
He is particularly critical of what he
terms “the empire building of Sir Wil-
liam Gunn”.
The fact that Hitchins lays into “Big
Bill” is more significant than it might
appear "
There was a time, in the years just
after the war, when Hitchins and Gunn
(then Mr W. A. Gunn) were close,
Hitchins was one of the leaders of the
group which wanted retention of Joint
Organisation for the selling of wool.
Gunn was president of the Graziers’
Association of Queensland—the only

which did not °PP° se JO-

-much to say that his subsequent career
can be directly traced to the impact he
made on growers at that time.
Gunn emerged from the post-JO fray
of the late ’forties as the “bright young
man bf the Graziers”; a progressive
thinker amongst the conservatives, with
the ability to talk sense to large and
small growers alike. Withal he had a
sound background of practical sheep
farming and a “no-nonsense” personality.
The gulf which now separates Hitchins
and Gunn in the ’sixties is a good illus-
tration of the feeling that has been
aroused over wool promotion and mar-
keting.
Now Hitchins says of Gunn:
“Under Sir William Gunn’s direction a
comparatively modest wool promotion
set-up has mushroomed to almost incre-
dible proportions. One is reminded of
the public servant who starts off with a
small desk in a small office and ends up
with a vast department.
“Many people have questioned whether
anyone with Sir William Gunn's limited
experience in the world of advertising
and promotion is sufficiently experienced
to keep a firm hold on an organisation
of the kind which has grown up around
him.”
Gunn has declined so far to answer
Hitchins or, for that matter, any of his
critics.
He is a shrewd campaigner and he
avoids personal squabbling. When in
trouble he invariably does something
audacious —such as telling the Japanese
critics of the quality of Australian wool,
that no one was forcing them to buy it.
The fact that the Japanese Govern-
ment has restricted credits, resulting in
recent falls in wool prices, might indicate
that it is not the quality so much that
they are concerned about, but how much
of their cotton goods we buy.
Should Gunn decide to answer Hitch-
ins, however, Man on the Land might
save fhe Wool Board army of public
relations men much “intensive research”.
Gunn might say that Hitchins’ claim
that some international advertising
agency could do the job of wool pro-
motion much better and more cheaply
is not so.
Hitchins might be unaware of the
rates at which these international agen-
cies, especially the American ones
operate.
While it costs the Australian wool-
growers a lot of money to have wool
promoted through the Wool Board and
the International Wool Secretariat, there
is no evidence to indicate that its staff,
is overpaid by international standards. .
At least with its own staff the IWy
could, if necessary, put the brake on.
Too lavish promotion?
Jiving the job to some outside agency
would be asking to be taken for a
ride.
This, of course, does not answer the
question “Is promotion on such a lavish)
scale really necessary?”
Hitchins, and plenty of other wool-
growers, are particularly scathing of what
they term the “frivolities” of the Wool
Board.
The recent “world premiere” of a
Hollywood film, “Come Blow Youri
Horn” (a rather apt title), which, some-'
how or other, was supposed to promotel
wool, is a case in point.
Guests, said to be “socialites”, but
according to one report, mainly juniors
from advertising and fashion houses,
were treated to champagne and a great
whingding was had by all.
To Hitchins such things are beyond
reason. He began as a woolgrower ii
the west after the First World War and
both as farmer and farmers’ advocate
he fought a long and hard battle, eventu
ally rising to president of the Australia
Wool and Meat Producers' Federation
Now he has come out of retirement
to once again plead the case for wool
marketing. And to Hitchins this is a
sacred cause in which there is no place
for “frivolities”.
On the matter of “frivolities”, there-,
fore, Man on the Land can offer Sir Wil-
liam no advice at all. This is one ha
can think up an answer to himself.
It has been said (not by Mr Hitchins)
that even poodle dogs have been on the
Wool Board free list for items such as
“shampoo and manicure”.
Another matter, the one of the sub-j
sidies paid to textile and clothing manu-,
facturers in many countries to help them|
promote wool, is raised by Hitchins.
This really does warrant a very d e ‘
tailed explanation by the Wool Board
and the IWS.
’ Hitchins asks: “On what basis are
subsidies paid and why do some firms
receive subsidies while others do not?
He says that growers are unable to
obtain a clue as to the amounts distribu-
ted and are unable to break through the
air of mystery surrounding the promotion
activities.
Whether Hitchins gets an answer or
not, the growers are clearly going to have

much to say when the marketing com-
mittee of the Wool Board makes its
report to the Australian Wool Industry
Conference in Canberra on July 16 and
17.
The majority agreed to a fourfold levy
increase to provide funds for promotion
on the assumption that marketing would
be improved.
Tf, and only if, the AWIC decides on
* a change from the present free
auction system, a referendum of growers
will be necessary to decide what kind
ot marketing will take the place of the
free auction system.
The simplest question of all thereupon
becomes the biggest—who will get the
vote?
Does, for example, a man who pro-
duces 10 bales a year or more qualify as
a woolgrower? (There are some 90,000
in this category.)
Those people who favor change, in-
cluding Hitchins and Mr L. A. Simpson
of Oaklands, NSW, say that on a straight-
out vote of woolgrowers change to a
reserve price scheme would be automatic.
Simpson, as related in these columns
previously, has run test votings of his
own at various centres, which indicate
that such a result would be a foregone
conclusion.
But recently Mr G. D'Arcy Chislett,
the economist of the Australian Wool-
growers’ and Graziers’ Council (Federal
body of the Graziers’ Association),
issued a paper in which he stressed that
there must be a “minimum qualification
to exclude those with no real interest in
the affairs of the industry”.
He said that 20 per cent of wool-
growers produce more than half the total
clip.
“ ‘Woolgrower’ must be defined in such
a way as to ensure equity for the inter-
ests of those to whom wool production
is a substantial or predominant activity,
or alternatively a system of multiple
voting in relation to production must be
employed,” wrote Mr Chislett.
It was this reference to “multiple
voting” which caused the advocates of
change to exclaim that the graziers were
up to their old trick of trying to get
“one bale one vote”.
As there are thousands of woolgrowers
who do get along on about 10 bales a
year (say £900), together with some
mixed farming—and as there are large
pastoral companies producing 1000 bales
or more—such a suggestion from Mr
Chislett was, as one angry farmer put
it, “High Grazier Policy at its worst.
At the JO vote the qualification was
five bales. Why the change?”
To be fair to Mr Chislett, however,
he did come up with another suggestion.
This was that 50 per cent of the votes
go to those producing 50 bales or more
and 50 per cent to those producing less
than 50 bales.
This one has implications not visible
on the surface.
It is, roughly speaking, what is already
the voting situation in the Australian
Wool Industry Conference, with 25 men
representing the Graziers’ Associations
and 25 most of the other organisations
to which the smaller growers belong.
It might be argued: “Is a referendum
necessary?”
Mr Chislett’s critics point out that,
human nature being what it is, there is
much more likelihood of some smaller
growers (the borderline cases) going over
and voting with the graziers than the
reverse.
There is little chance of the smaller
growers’ bodies accepting this suggestion
of Mr Chislett.
Rather, it will encourage them to press
more strongly than ever for the principle
of “one grower one vote” and the ex-
pression “we represent people not sheep”
will be used by many advocates of
marketing change.
Mr Chislett does strike a telling blow
when he says that all the people advo-
cating change to a reserve price scheme
are contributing to confusion and dis-
tracting thought from what could be done
to improve the present auction system.
In general terms, men like Hitchins,
Simpson and others have an alliance in
that they want marketing change, but
that is about as far as it goes.
This is rather to their credit.
Were they completely unified they
might, instead of suggesting ways in
which the Wool Board and the IWS
might be set to rights, begin to think of
ways to topple these bodies.
A quotation from Hitchins’ book is
worthy of consideration by all those
interested in wool politics:
“The graziers of tomorrow, wishing
to secure a share of protection for them-
selves, need not expect to find that pri-
vilege willingly extended. They will be
excluded from the charmed circle until
they themselves force an entry.”
So far there has been no forcing and
no real marshalling of forces. After
July 16 and 17 —who can tell?
Tomato Seed Warning
rpoMATO seed is often selected by sort-
ing through a number of cases of
fruit after a normal picking. Mr N. K.
de Vaus, horticultural adviser of the
Victorian Department of Agriculture,
warns that this method can easily lead
to serious degeneration of quality and
yield of the strain that is saved. No
check can be made on plant vigor,
cropping ability and habit, freedom
from disease, or consistent fruit quality.
A better method is to select indi-
vidual plants from the growing crop and
save fruit for seed only from these
plants.
Oil Pipelines for
Moving Wheat
TPhe feasibility of moving wheat in
plastic capsules through oil pipelines
is being studied by scientists of the
Research Council of Alberta, Canada.
The idea is to move the capsules
through the pipes with the oil, but
problems have arisen first in by-passing
pumping stations and, secondly, in getting
the capsules into the pipeline most
efficiently.
The researchers, however, are con-
fident of overcoming these problems. If
so, farmers would be able to move wheat
all the year round, missing the winter
snows and cutting storage costs.
Pipeline for Milk
A Pipeline If miles long is piping milk
to dairies in the valleys of the
Northern Caucasus Mountains in Russia.
Milk from the highlands, 8000 feet above
sea level, takes only 18 minutes to go
through the polythene pipe.

ial photograph of the Australian National Antarctic Research Expedition
Veteran car?
Any day, at the Australian Antarctic Ex-
pedition base at Mawson, you can see this.
A Volkswagen.
Working.
Hauling sleds.
Carrying Glaciologists to and from work.
Scouting over ice fields that would make
our pot holes feel like the smoothest con-
crete.
But the Volkswagen you’d see at Antarc-
tica now isn’t the one in the picture.
That's Antarctica 1.
You’d see Antarctica 2.
We brought the first one back to check
up on a few things.
How did our air-cooled engine stand up
to the conditions?
Did it start every time?
Did our baked enamel finish weather
the cold?
Did our suspension take the battering it
got?
Antarctica 1 passed like a veteran.
Flying colours.
So Antarctica 2 isn’t there
to prove anything.
Just to work.

WHAT WOULD YOU SEE IF YOU
LOOKED INSIDE HIS MIND?
Perhaps a hundred thousand things—because his interests
are so wide they cover the whole great world. And every one
of these interests is important. They are the seeds of talent
Some may even form the basis for his career. But there is
no quick way to tell which ones reflect true ability. Only
time —and encouragement—can do that.
To provide such encouragement is one of the many reasons
for having Encyclopaedia Britannica in the home. Britannica
encourages a child to reach for knowledge. It takes him as
far as his young mind can go, then leads him still further
when he is aide. For Encyclopaedia Britannica covers in depth
every conceivable interest a growing mind could have.
No other reference set can do so much to help a child take
full advantage of his talents and to help develop them into a
career interest, because no other reference library goes so
deeply into every field of human endeavour.
