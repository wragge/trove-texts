This eminent Specialist, Founder, and Chief
Surgeon of the long-established and favourably-
known Dispensary that now bears his name, re-
ceived his medical education in the leading colleges
and hospitals of Europe. He has devoted a life-
time to the study of
PRIVATE, NERVOUS, AND SKIN
DISEASES.
He has by profound research thoroughly investi-
gated their origin, traced their deadly sources and
insidious dissemination, and ascertained the surest
and safest methods by which they may be eradi-
cated, with these widely recognised qualifications
combined with unswerving faithfulness to his
patients, he has during his practice, extending
over FORTY YEARS, attained a well-deserved
pre-eminence in their treatment. His practice
embraces diseases which probably cause more un-
happiness than any other class of troubles that
afflict mankind.
YOUNG MEN

gressions or excesses of more nature age, bladder
difficulties, a whitish or dark ropy sediment in
the water, accompanied by slight burning or
smarting sensation, Headaches, Drowsiness during
the day, circles round the eyes. Giddiness,
irregularity of the bowels, specks before the eyes,
bashfulness, discontentedness, weakness or pains

buzzing noises in the cars and head, pimples, a
fear that something dreadful is about to happen,
weak stomach, yellow or blood-shot eyes, impure
blood, hasty, uncontrollable temper, hacking
cough, who cannot marry, nervousness in society,
wakefulness, palpitation of the heart, general
weakness, and other symptoms which lead to in-
sanity and death, should consult him, for he has
mastered these difficulties. On receipt of 6d. in
stamps he will send secure from observation in a

Showing plainly how all diseases of the private or
nervous system may be cured thoroughly and per-
manently without unnecessary expence. This
book will prove a valuable companion, and even
though you be perfectly well its general inform-
tion and prescription may assist you in restoring
some poor friend to health even after his case has
been pronounced incurable by his medical at-
tendant.
ONE POUND IS SUFFICIENT TO
SEND
for Remedies necessary for the cure of NER-
VOUS DEBILITY. Should you require medical
treatment, as procrastination is sometimes dan-
gerous, it would be advisable for you to sit down
quietly in your chamber and write to the doctor,
detailing every experienced symptom. He will
on receipt of such a letter, write you, promptly
and courteously, a candid and straightforward
oponion of your case. If you do not think yon
understand the case, send for ids famous medical
work, the price of which is but sixpence; enclosed
in the volume will be found a list of carefully-pre-
pared questions, which will, in all probability,
assist you materially in describing your ailment.
Dr. Richards uses nothing but the purest remedies,
and never prescribes mercury under any circum-
stances. The moment letters arc carefully per-
used and answered they arc destroyed by tire,
and patients may rest assured that their cases
will remain a secret between the doctor and
themselves. Dr. Richards has successfully treated
nearly 25,000 cases since coming to Australia, and
has permission from at least 10,000 persons to
show their written evidence of his success. Ml

DR. KELLY’S REPUTATION IS SO THOROUGHLY ESTABLISHED THAT IT WILL
ONLY BE NECESSARY FOR HIM TO INTIMATE THAT HE IS PRACTISING AS A
SPECIALIST TO BE APPRECIATED AS A BENEFACTOR TO SUFFERING MANKIND. AS
THE GREATER PORTION OF THE NEW SOUTH WALES PUBLIC IS AWARE, DR. KELLY
IS A LEGALLY QUALIFIED AND REGISTERED PHYSICIAN, AND HAS BY FAR THE
LARGEST PRACTICE IN THE COLONIES. MANY PERSONS AT A DISTANCE, HOWEVER,
ARB UNAWARE OF HIS GREAT SUCCESS, AS, HITHERTO, HE HAS REFRAINED FROM
ADVERTISING. HENCE, TO WIDEN THE SPHERE OF HIS USEFULNESS, HE HAS
DETERMINED, BY MEANS OP ADVERTISING, TO MAKE HIMSELF KNOWN IN REMOTE
DISTRICTS WHERE HIS REPUTATION MAY NOT YET HAVE TRAVELLED. AS THE
QUESTION MAY ARISE, WHY DOES SO EMINENT A PHYSICIAN AS DR. KELLY FIND
IT NECESSARY TO ADVERTISE, HE MAY REPLY TO ONE AND ALL AS FOLLOWS
IF THERE IS A PERSON ON EARTH TO BE PITIED IT IS HE WHO IS OBLIGED
TO ASSOCIATE WITH HIS FELLOW BEINGS WHILE HIS MIND IS CONSTANTLY
HARASSED AND TORTURED BY THE CONSCIOUSNESS OP
WHAT MUST INEVITABLY FOLLOW.
HE LOOKS HAGGARD AND SHEEPISH. HE IS NERVOUS IN PUBLIC, AND EXTREMELY
GIRLISH AND BACKWARD IN LADIES’ SOCIETY. THE VICTIM OP THIS, THE MOST
DANGEROUS OP ALL VICES, IP NOT RELIEVED, SOON REACHES A STATE WHICH MUST
END IN LIFE-LONG MISERY. HE MUST ULTIMATELY SINK TO THE LOWEST STAGE
OP DEGRADATION AND SHAME. DR. KELLY MAINTAINS THAT THE PHYSICIAN WHO
HAS THE POWER TO CURE, AND REMAINS SILENT, IS GUILTY OP AN UNPARDONABLE
SIN OP OMISSION. PERSONS WHO READ HIS GREAT WORK ON THIS SUBJECT WILL
BE SHOWN THE INEVITABLE RESULT OP THE BAD HABITS, AND IN MOST
INSTANCES SUFFICIENTLY EARLY IN LIFE TO ENABLE THEM
TO SEE THEIR FOLLY
BEFORE ANY DISEASE HAS TAKEN POSSESSION OF THEM. THE BOOK WILL ALSO
SHOW THEM CLEARLY
HOW TO CURE THE DISEASE WITHOUT
THE ASSISTANCE OF PHYSICIAN OR CHEMIST.
MANY PERSONS WONDER WHY THEIR MEMORY IS NOT SO RETENTIVE, AND THEIR
GENERAL INTELLECT NOT SO CLEAR AND STRONG AS THEY FORMERLY WERE.
DR. KELLY'S BOOK WILL EXPLAIN THE CAUSE IN PLAIN AND SIMPLE LANGUAGE.
THEREFORE, EVEN THOUGH YOU BE FREE PROM DISEASE, SEND FOR THIS GREAT
MEDICAL WORK, THAT YOU MAY BE ENABLED TO ADVISE OTHERS AFTER PERUSING
ITS PAGES. VERY FREQUENTLY THIS MAY BE DONE BEFORE ANY GREAT HAEM
HAS TAKEN PLACE.

DISEASE HAS LEFT ITS MARKS.
AMONG WHICH ARE

BETRAY A MIND ILL AT EASE, HIS MENTAL OPERATIONS ARE
ERRATIC, HE IS EMBARRASSED, AWKWARD, AND ACTS WITHOUT
ANY FIXED PURPOSE, HE IS ABSENT-MINDED, AND GIVEN TO

J. C. Neild, M.L.A. of New South Wales, lias
recently arisen to carry on, in another direction,
the good work begun by the deceased Athenian
Solon some while since. Solon was the apostle
of cheap law ; J. C. Neild is the Mahomet of
low-priced lawyers. Solon had his laws cut
upon tablets of wood. Wood rots within 50
years at the outside ; the laws would hence, of
necessity, be re-cut twice a century. Solon
considered 50 years a good long life for any law.
He argued that people alter, that conditions
alter, and that the ideals of the present become
worm-eaten and time-gnawed within two
generations hence. The recutting of the laws,
therefore, on new-hewn wood, afforded future
legislators opportunity for revision and excision,
and, in short, re-editing Solon down to date.
J. C. Neild misses the point, and yearns for a
lawyer on a modern plan. He would leave the
machinery as it is and change only, the engineer.
This is almost as painfully illogical as an
attempt to feed a horse on beef-steaks, or an
anaconda on chaff and water.
* # #
Some days before the Christmas recess, Mr.
Neild lifted up his jawbone in the New
South Wales Parliament and demanded the
abolition of the regulations at present restricting
the practice of the law to the wealthy, who can
afford to devote several years to a life of semi-
idleness in alleged study at a university, where
nearly everything in the world is taught to the
budding lawyer, excepting a knowledge of the
law itself. Thereupon, all the lawyers in the
House rose as one man and protested strongly
against this encroachment upon their exclusive
and tradition-bastioned preserves. One light
of the Bar turned upbraidingly upon the
Labour party and demanded, petulantly:
“Where was their respect for trades-unionism?”
as if the business of the Labour party in the
House was to maintain the privileges of a legal
guild any more than those of a capitalistic ring.
Another lawyer compared the class to which he
belonged to the medical profession, and insisted
upon the necessity of preserving the public
from the exploitation of quacks. This, of
course, was an absolute giving away of the
whole case : for. where as quackery is the death
of medicine, there is no profession or trade
under the sun to which quackery is pure
life - blood and vital necessity more than
to the legal interest. But let us concede
that the lawyers and doctors stand on common
ground ; is it very romantic or Utopian then to
advocate a system of State-dispensed law and
State-dispensed medicine, in which system
lawyers and doctors would collect no fees from
the public, but, like the judge and the health-
officer, would be salaried by tim Government ?
We think not!
* * *
A third legal parliamentarian demanded not
easier but more difficult examinations and longer
periods of probation before the assumption of
the long robe and the horse-hair head-gear. He
pointed out that a knowledge of etymology was
of vast use in interpreting the terms of Acts in
archaic jargon, and that the large employment
of Latin in law made it necessary for intending
lawyers to devote huge sections of their lives
upon earth to the reading of Horace and Ovid
and the “ Satyricon ” of Petronius Arbiter.
Here, then, is a useful hint for providing the
public at the highest possible cost with another
legal functionary—the etymologist, whose busi-
ness shall be grammatical and explicatory, and
whose knowledge shall comprise not an ac-
quaintance with Justinian’s Institutes so much
as a comprehensive acquaintance with Max
Muller and Professor Sayce. In short, the
compiler of a good legal dictionary would be a
qualified Candidate for the office of Chief Jus-
tice, for the administration of the law is evi-
dently— taking our last-mentioned speaker for
guide—more a matter of the right (or wrong)
definition of a word or a phrase than the deter-
mination of a principle.
# # «
Ther e is, however, another side to the ques-
tion. Let us revert to Solon, and, instead of
complicating the mental machinery of the very
limited capacities of the average lawyer, en-
deavour to simplify the law. (Napoleon has
somewhat redeemed a reputation for wholesale
butchery by giving France a code. Let us boil
down the whole legal refuse at present in use
to something congruous, homogeneous, and more
suited to our needs. Instead of demanding
wide reading into the legislative barbarism of
the past from an expensive legal vampire, let
us amend, excise and codify all we require in
the way of law to our own present and vital
requirements. Why should not the various
provincial governments of Australia select some
of their ablest lawyers, and commit to them
the splendid task of framing a Federal Code ?
Let us abolish a condition of things which allows
an Australian government to revive age-dead
laws for the purpose of meeting exceptional con-
tingencies, and appeal to an enactment passed
in the reign of George IV. for the purpose
of suppressing a Queensland shearer. We
have men in Australia to whom we could
safely entrust such a work. In such a con-
nection the names of Chief Justice Higin-
botham, Julian Salomons, Q.C., and Samuel
Griffith, Q.C., will readily occur to hun-
dreds of Australians ; nor would a salary to
each of £5OOO per annum for five years be an
exorbitant expenditure for such a desirable
result. We are confronted with the alter-
native-cheap law or dear lawyers. Which
are we going to adopt ? Are we going to
bastion in the privileges of a monopolistic
guild, or are we going to rationalise our laws
and bring them into harmony with the con-
ditions of our existence ? J. C. JSTetld is out
of court—shall we adopt the method of Solon
and cut our enactments on the wood that
perishes ? In other words, do we mean to
periodically revise our laws, cast aside those
no longer of any value, and bring our code
right down to date. To commence this will be
one of the first privileges of Federated Aus-
tralia.
N.S.W. Civil Service Retrenchment.
The N.S. W. Civil Service has resolved to form
an association for defence against outside
enemies. In other words, it has resolved to
fall back on trades-union principles, but, for
the sake of the respectability that is embodied
in its black coat and its shiny hat, it spreads a
thin disguise over the fact. There is no pro-
vision for strike pay in its programme, for
going on strike is a common device only suited
to the common, horny toiler ; there are no
arrangements for boycotting anybody ; and
there is no real light of any kind in the whole
programme. Its objects are expressed as
follows :
(a) To establish unity throughout the service, whereby
its interests might be protected and advanced, (b) To
provide a representative organisation for the purpose of
thoroughly discussing all matters affecting the service,
and which shall he an acknowledged authority qualified
to express the voice thereof. (<•) To promote social
intercourse and encourage friendly feeling among mem-
bers of the service, and thus sweep away jealousies and
differences which will always prevail when men are dis-
united and have no rallying point, (d) To vindicate the
rights of the service and uphold its just claims ; to main-
tain respect for and confidence in the employes of the
State, to seek to obtain recognition of the principle that
there is no higher field of duty for a man than the faith-
ful service of his country, and that such service should
command due consideration and fair reward, (e) To
advocate the abolition of patronage and to uphold the
principle of advancement upon the grounds of seniority
and merit. (f) To advocate amendment of the present
Civil Service Act. (g) To provide a means of united
action in the event of the reasonable interests of the ser-
vice being endangered by sudden or extreme changes of
policy, (h) To collect statistics and other data in which
the service might be in any way interested, and to estab-
lish a library where all such information would be acces-
sible to members.
This is a suave and gentlemanly programme,
but if the Civil Service Association means to do
any real good, it had better resolve to drop
everything except Article E, and to fight for
Article E like a cart-load of wild cats. Patron-
age is the one huge grievance of the civil ser-
vant. The individual who has no political
influence remains a cheap and unconsidered
drudge in a Government office to the end of his
days. He contributes all his life to the
superannuation fund, and at the best only gets
an infinitesimal pension in his old age, and
generally gets none at all, but dies in a used-up
condition before lie is old enough to claim one.
Ho never, in any case, gets his pension before
he is fJU, while the man with influence often
gets Ids at 40. For the latter person is
often stricken with a mortal disease at that
age, and is retired on a. liberal annual allowance
out of the moneys paid by the miserable pariah
who has no relative in Parliament, and after
that he usually recovers and draws his allow-
ance for 50 years or thereabouts, and mean-
while the other man works for him and keeps
him going. Nobody ever enquires too closely
into the facts of the case, when a Civil-servant,
whose uncle is in Parliament, asks to be made
a genteel pauper in his middle-age, owing to
neurasthenia, or something ; but the man whose
uncle is not in Parliament would be stripped
and examined with a microscope before he
would get a cent out of the fund on such a
plea. The whole superannuation system is a
swindle, whereby politicians are enabled to
pension off their friends out of the earnings of
the country postmistress and the small girl
who drudges her life out in a bush school, and
similar unfortunates. It is a cold billet indeed
to be a Civil-servant without political influence.
Moreover, the Civil Service is the butt of
every Government that is hard-up, and every
newspaper that wants to gain a little cheap
popularity. There is a ceaseless demand for
“ retrenchment,” and retrenchment never falls
on the influential man with the lying medical
certificate and the pension, but always on the
drudge, who must stay on and be retrenched
because he has no other hopes or prospects.
The following extracts from a Sydney Sunday
paper are a fair sample of the war-whoop which
goes forth whenever New South Wales is hard-
up, and it is necessary to cut down somebody
else’s salary to meet the difficulty :
The annual revenue of the colony is, in round numbers.
£10,000,000, and the amount paid out of this for salaries
alone (exclusive of the military and naval vote of £228,043)
is £3,255,000, or equivalent to 32'5 per cent, of the whole.
In other words, one-third of the total revenue of New
South Wales is absorbed in the payment of salaries alone.
This assuredly is startling enough as placed in the light of
£ s. d., but it is still more so when a comparison is made
on the basis of population. The census of last March
gave the population of the colony us 1,132,501. The
number of persons in the employ of the Government is
as follows:
Permanent Officers ... ~ 24,709
Temporary Officers ~ .. 1,258
25,967
or one in every 48 of the entire population of the colony
—men, women, and children. Then, it we next turn to
Mr. Couiilan’s estimate of the male population (612,697),
and reasonably deduct one-half as being under working
age, it will be found that 1 in 11 of the adolescent and adult
male population is in receipt of Government pay. . . .
The population of Great Britain and Ireland is 38,609,000 ;
the revenue of the United Kingdom is £90,000,000 ; and
the Civil Service expenditure in salaries is £26,588,000—0r
29'5 per cent, of the entire revenue as againstN.S. W.’s32 - 5.
At first sight the difference (3 per cent.) does not appear
to be very great: but it must be remembered that the
British public, existing, as it does, under an extravagantly
costly monarchical form of Government, is saddled with
“ Civil List” burthens, for the equivalent of which we in
New South Wales have to make no provision. While
here, as already shown, one in 11 males of working age is
in receipt of Government pay, in Great Britain (array and
navy excluded) the proportion is about one in 65.
This sort of thing looks well for an incoherent
yell at election times, but it is awful drivel and
ignorance after all. In the first place, the
revenue of N.S. Wales is not £10,000,000, but
something less than £6,000,000. It is artificially
swelled on paper by putting down on the
revenue side a lot of such bogus items as “gross
railway receipts, £2,500,000,” and on the expen-
diture side such items as “ working expenses of
railways, £2,000,000,” instead of simply entering
as received the balance of half-a-million. This
sort of proceeding makes the revenue look
enormous, but the items are utterly meaning-
less, and the total is really nowhere above the
average. And the Civil Service is also made to
look something stupendous, as compared with
that of Great Britain. But then three-fourths
of it is made up of railway-servants, policemen,
and school teachers, none of whom come under
the Civil Service heading in England, and there
the whole comparison falls through. The al-
leged elevated Civil Service of N.S. Wales,
accepting the term as it is understood in Eng-
land and most other countries, numbers only
about 3400 individuals, or one in 300 of the
population, and most of them are paid at a rate
which leaves little room for retrenchment. It
ought, undoubtedly, to be cut down, but when
a reduction of the Service is advocated as a sure
means of making both ends meet and an alter-
native to Protection, it becomes a matter of
sheer insanity—there is so little of it that even
if the Civil Service, properly so called, was cut
down altogether, the saving would not fill the
gap. And the individuals who should be re-
trenched—the semi-idiot who has been shoved
into a profitable job by his uncle, the politician,
and the person who was pensioned off at 40 on
account of an incurable disease of which he
never seems to die—somehow never appear to
be affected by any scheme of retrenchment.
The Drivel of Our Fathers.
So far as can be judged by present appearances
the One-man-one-vote Bill will find its grave in
the New South Wales Legislative Council with
the politically smellful John Davies to officiate
as principal fossil at its interment. No definite
decision has yet been arrived at, but it is already
sufficiently evident that the sense of the nominee
House is—as usual —against any change in the old
order of things, and that the irresponsible
branch of the provincial Legislature is ranged, as
of old, on the side of Property, Up to date only
two members have damned the measure with faint
praise, and the rest have been uncompromisingly
hostile. The speeches, in almost every case, were
pitiable in their utter stupidity, and the efforts of
sundry councillors to offer a reason for their
opposition resulted in failure. A few doddering
old ruins plodded over the same weary arguments
which have been used and refuted over and over
again, but the majority simply stated that they
were “agin the Bill,” and intended to remain so,
and wisely went no further. The surpassing
idiocy of the New South Wales Constitution
appoints a Government to carry on the business
of the country and an Opposition to prevent them
doing it, and an Upper House to make dead sure
that they don’t do it, and the Upper House, in
the present instance, is fulfilling its purpose to the
letter. It exists for no earthly object except to
prevent the Government doing it, and its s”---'sss
in this respect is beyond all praise.
* * *
The Hon. John Davies, C.M.G., he of the
oily voice and the three old hats, struck a
sympathetic chord at the beginning of the
debate: —
Consider the question of oue-man-one-votc in another
aspect. Here is my honourable friend, Mr Vickery, whose
freehold property in Sydney is worth, perhaps, £500.000,
and who has goods stored in that property worth, per-
haps, £lOO,OOO. Is it just that the electoral' 'qualification
in respect of such property should he bestowed upon the
caretaker or the watchman, rather than upon the gentle-
man, who, through his industry and thrift, has acquired
it? Under the provisions of the Bill the hon. member
himself would receive no electoral qualification by reason
of his possessions in the city.
Now the thing of all others that glares out conspicu-
ously in the One-man-one-vote Bill is that no one
is to have a vote in respect of any property what-
ever, but solely because he is a sane, full-
grown, male Australian citizen out of gaol.
His address is registered, not because he is to
have a suffrage on account of having an address,
but simply in order that he can be found and
identified when he is wanted. The question
whether Davies’s gilded friend Vickery should
have an extra vote because his fortune is larger
than the average, and the other question whether
he should not also have another extra vote if Lis
ears are likewise larger than the average, also the
manifest impossibility of Vickery’s' pile or any
other of its colossal dimensions having been
accumulated by “industry and thrift,” and the
hideous improbability of Vickery being the
“friend ” of the apostle of the three hats, may all
be left, for the time being, out of the question.
The one utterly astonishing circumstance of the
case is that the Upper House can no more under-
stand the possibility of a pure manhood suffrage
than it can understand Chinese poetry, and
because Vickery is not to have an extra vote on
account of his property it concludes that that
extra vote is to be transferred to his watchman or
his caretaker or the outcast who camps on his
doorstep, and will, in all probability, reject the
measure on that account. It has been explained
several million times that under the new regime
there will be no vote whatever attached to pro-
perfey, but the Council is no nearer understanding
the point than it was at the beginning. The
matter might as well have been a Greek discourse
delivered to a deaf Hottentot. Either the Upper
House can’t read large print or else it is mentally
incapable of understanding it when it is read.
This gang of dotards might as wisely have objected
to the Bill on the ground that it would cause
cruelty to dogs, and prevent a deceased wife’s
sister being buried in consecrated ground; in
either case their incapacity could have gone no
further than it had already done.
» * • ,
An ancient person named Charles, however
who, by his own showing, had crawled from a
sick bed to block the cause of progress, broke even
this record. His reasons were as follows :
Who are the people it is proposed to disfranchise? My
memory carries me back 40 years—to the time when the
pioneers of settlement in this country went out into the
bush and purchased land which they cleared by their own
industry and hard labour. The money paid for the land
was applied to immigration— to bring out the men who
now cry for one-man-one-vote. Who really brought them
here? Why, the pioneers brought them here, made
homes for them, and spent years of industry clearing the
land and employing these men, who were brought out at
the public expense Is it just or reasonable
that these pioneers should be refused the right to vote for
representatives to make laws for the well-being of society
and the benefit of the country, and that the cowboys who
are on the farms should have a better right than the
owners who have improved the land ?
Probably it would be useless to tell this object of
public scorn that the meaning of one-man-one-vote
is simply that every man shall have a vote, and
that the “cowboy ” will not have a “ better right ”
than the landowner, but merely the same right-
no more and no less. And it would be
equally useless to point out that the Bill
docs not disfranchise any pioneer, for this
fossil is also incapable of comprehending plain
English. There is a wildness of mendacity in his
reasoning which is beyond all ordinary expression.
The assumption that every man who wants plural
voting was a pioneer, and that every man who
does not want plural voting was an assisted im-
migrant is altogether too large for words. More-
over, the pioneer obviously paid his money for the
land, and not to bring out discontented im-
migrants, and having got full value for the money
nobody owes him any debt of gratitude whatever.
Further, the cost of immigration mostly came out
of loan-votes; the boasted pioneer never “made
a home ” for anybody but himself ; and he did not
“ spend years of industry in employing those men
who were brought out at the public expense it
was the latter who silent their years working for
the alleged pioneer. ‘ The spectacle of that soulful
landowner being “refused the right to vote for
representatives to make laws fur the well-being of
society and the benefit of the country” is doubt-
less pathetic, but no one proposes or has proposed
to deprive him of the right, as Mr. Charles must
be aware. But all the same this picture of a
mythical pioneer deprived of his right to vote
visibly moved the House of ancient drivel, and
broughttheOne-Man-One-Vote Bill a shade nearer
to its final end.
* # #
Another mass of eloquence from the same
speaker is equally remarkable :
That is only one class of industrious men who are to be
deprived of their rights. There is another class of men
who came out and brought capital with them, or made
money here I)3' their industiy and went up the county,
took up stations and purchased homesteads. These men,
because they come to reside in Sydney to look after the
business connected with their stations, are to be deprived
of the right to vote whilst the rouseabouts on the stations
are to have it. It is simply ridiculous. In many instances
men have spent half a lifetime in Sydney in industry,
and invested their all in taking up land, clearing it and
stumping it, and yet these men are to be deprived of the
right to have a voice in making the laws of the country,
whereas the cowbo}' on the station is to have a vote.
The thing is infamous.
Possibly the unlettered wretch who gave way to
such awful rage over the disfranchised squatter
really believed that victim to be a genuine indivi-
dual, and failed to understand that his suffrage
was not going to be violently torn from him. An
Upper House and an aborigine are two things
whose credulity is almost beyond measurement.
# * #
The Council’s remaining reasons were, if pos-
sible, even a shade more imbecile. A legal
gentleman named Pilcher rose to point out that
the man who possessed no property should not be
allowed to vote at all, because he was in a posi-
tion to quit the country at any moment, whereas
the man of property was tied to the soil and
consequently had a “stake.” There was a horrible
incapacity about this logic, because the latter
individual can realise his property at any time,
and pay his way out of the country with the pro-
ceeds, while the man who has no property can’t
leave at all except on foot, and no one can quit
Australia on foot for obvious reasons ; therefore,
if Mr. Pilcher’s reasoning proved anything at
all, it proved that the capitalist should be dis-
franchised altogether, and no one save the dead-
beat be allowed to vote at all. But the gathering
of old cripples never even noticed the discrepancy.
One Hoskins asserted that the Ono-man-one-
vote principle had caused the failure of the last
South Australian loan, that it would lead to
mobs parading the streets at election times and
raising perdition generally ; and that only one
newspaper in all New South Wales was in
favour of the measure. Finally, Sir William
Manning approved of the One - man - one -
vote Bill in part, but proposed to move
an amendment in Committee whereby tho
plural vote of property should continue as at pre-
sent—in other words be demanded that every man
should have one vote, and some of them should
have more. And then, drearily and wretchedly,
the debate fizzled out. Excepting Mr. R. e!
O’Connor and bis namesake, Daniel, the mea-
sure apparently had not one single friend in the
Council. There was a fearsome iteration about
the claims of property, and the claims of anything
else were never once mentioned. There was much
solemn declamation about “thrift,” but no other
virtue came to the surface during the entire dis-
cussion. Nobody talked of anything but
land and bricks and mortar. The whole pro-
ceeding was a dismal evidence that the
House was one-half unspeakable incapacity and
one-half bigotry and drivel. But unluckily the
Council is irremoveable, and its diseased brain
isn’t responsible to anybody. It is a gathering of
69 emperors, mostly insane, whose power, in a
passive sense, is utterly despotic. Practically


i ile they endure it doesn’t matter much whether

PLAIN ENGLISH.
The N.S.W. Deadhead Subsidy.
Y Victorian Select Committee which recently
investigated the fraudulently abused system of
free railway-passes, has recommended, amongst
other things, that members of Parliament be no
longer pauperised with a general free pass all
over the province’s railways, but be conveyed
by train free only between their ordinary resi-
dences and the parliamentary capital. This
simplicity of recommendation has the small
fault of being a trifle too narrow in some places,
and much too broad in others. For instance, a
member of Parliament may be required to
travel elsewhere than to and from his ordinary
residence purely on the country’s business, in
which case he should be franked on the
country’s railways'. On the other hand, the
alleged ordinary, residence of an lion, member—
and° what would legally bo upheld to mean
his ordinary residence —may, in reality, be
his least - frequented residence. A member
for a country electorate who habitually
lives in town, but has a bark shanty away
towards the bounds of solitude, may neverthe-
less choose to regard the latter as his ordinary
residence, and, on the strength of his free pass,
may negotiate at any time, and as often as he
pleases, the free journey from the metro-
polis to any town between it and his shanty.
The mind gaily treasures the memory of a
cheerful Queensland legislator who lived in
Brisbane but owned a back-blocks station
several hundreds of miles away, and who reli-
giously charged his well-bled country mileage-
fees for the whole distance, though he never
travelled it. The remedy for the free-pass
evil seems to be that members should be allowed
free railway journeys only between Parliament
and their homes in actual use; and that, for every
other occasion on which a memberclaims to travel
on the country’s errand, he should make a
separate written application, setting forth the
reason of his journey. Under the present
system, some hon. members and their employers
simply loaf upon the IState, and, by favored
competition, shut their non-parliamentary busi-
ness rivals out of the market that would be
otherwise available for their skilled labour.
This will be move easily understood by a few
examples. Tiger Inglis, M.P., is a drummer
by profession, his “ line being tea. Those
who employ him—or if he employs himself, the
argument applies personally—do not require to
pay on his account a yearly sum for a general
railway ticket —£100, loss traders’ allowances.
So that the legislative drummer can afford to
go to work (we don’t say he does, mind
you) at a rate meaning £lOO per year less
than a non-parliamentary tea-vendor. Then yon
have Mr. Allen, M.P.—an insurance-canvasser.
How can non-parliamentary insurance men
hope to compete with a rival who can skip all
over the country as a railway deadhead ? Then
John Haynes, the newspaper man, can secure
a good deal of the “ inner running ” in respect
of country affairs that necessitate much railway
travelling. Would the Evening News, again,
have commissioned Mr. Black, M.P., if they
had been obliged to pay his railway fare—even
at reduced press rates—to Melbourne? In
short, is not the system an unfair subsidy that,
without reasonable justification, unduly handi-
caps the non-parliamentary workers whose
votes created these Ms.P. ?
Italian Immigration.
An American visitor, Mr. John Warren, of
Philadelphia, writes us an interesting—but un-
fortunately too lengthy—letter upon low-class
Italian immigration. The following fairly
demonstrates what that cheap European is in
the United States, and what he will yet be in
Bananaland, unless the natives arise and throw
him out ere it is too late :
The Germans, Swedes, Danes, and Irish—l am now
speaking of the nations which emigrate to America in
very large numbers—are our best colonists, for they come
to stay.' Most of them make good colonists themselves,
and the second and third generations of them, or their
blend with our native population, make our very best
citizens. To-day, on our railways, few Irishmen are
employed, and gangs of workmen along the lines are
nearly entirely Italians, employed in gangs, living
meanly in shanties near their work, doing their
own washing, what little is done, foraging the neigh-
bourhoods near by, spending none of their earnings
in the country from which they draw them, and
retiring after a few years to live, in contrast with the
beggary from which they came, like princes. Few, almost
none of them, seek citizenship, and those who do are
generally from among the merchants, fruit-vendors and
cooks. It has resulted, of course, that the wages have
gone down, and they now receive about 60 cents. (2s. (id.)
per day, or about one-half of what the Americans or
Irish-Aiuericans (who used to constitute the bulk of the
labourers) a few years since received. They are not even
known by their names, but generally by numbers. And
when it happens, as it does almost weekly, that one of
these unfortunates is cut down by a passing or backing
train (or not unfrequently by a comrade’s stiletto), the
intelligent, “coroner’s jury” return a verdict that “an
Italian, name to the inquest unknown, but called No. 49,
was accidentally killed, and we exonerate the
Railroad from any blame or fault in the premises.”
In our coal and iron mines, and iron and steel manu-
factories, and puddling furnaces and rolling mills, it
is even worse, for there the depraved Hun, the degraded
Pole, and the vicious Bohemian have displaced the Ameri-
can workman and driven him to tramp the roads and
sleep on benches in the parks and under the trees of the
forests. These wretches have as little notion of remain-
ing in the country as the low-grade Italians. They live,
if possible, more meanly, 15 or 20 of them often packed
■ike sardines, or undertakers’ coffins, on shelves in a room
12ft. by 14ft. in size. One woman often does the cooking,
washing, and other domestic services for the entire gang.
If goes without saying that they work for from one-half
to two-thirds the wages received by American working
men. That is the only reason of their being in the
country. So soon as they accumulate a thousand or two
dollars they and their money betake themselves hack to
their own country, and a new horde of vampires is sent
m er to suck more blood out of the American victim. We
nave absolutely prohibited the further entrance of the
Chinese, and our officials are vigilant to prevent their
being smuggled in. The siinple-natured Celestial, objec-
tionable as he is, is much belter in intelligence, industry,
morals, and habits than those Goths who are despoiling
American labour of its rich and hardly-earned heritage.
The one bright feature in this true picture is the
death of imported Italian No. 49. But even that
doesn’t amount to much, when Italians 1 to 48
are still alive, and a ship loaded down with more
degraded aliens Nos. 50 to 100 is always on the
way, to fill the gap left by the lost numeral’s
decease.
The Unconvicted Prisoner.
The brutality of the treatment of unconvicted
prisoners, all over Australia, is such that little
exception can be taken to our correspondent’s
observations :
Dear Bulletin, —ln re your remarks concerning Bell,
the now “pardoned” Melbourne man, who was falsely
imprisoned, and could not take steps to prove his
innocence, I wish to remark that it would be a good thing
if twenty or thirty of our law-makers could get into gaol
incog., for say six months each. It would soon bring
about reform in. the treatment of accused persons. Now,
ns things are, a man under arrest, and presumed by the
law to be innocent, is looked upon as an already-con-
victed criminal by the police, and the greatest injury he
can do a constable is to make a defence of any kind. I
have yet to meet the policeman who would not convict a
man he knew to be innocent, rather than own he
couldn’t find the real offender. As you say, when a
man is charged with an offence, he is shut off
from all communication with the world. The gaoler
insults him. He herds with drunks, thieves, and China-
men, the other prisoners crowd around and welcome him
as a fellow-thief and kindly ask him “ what he is in for.”
He lias to salute and cringe to a hulking bogman in
uniform, whose brogue you could cut with a knife, and
call him “ sir,” and if he refuses he is very likely thrashed
with handcuffs and locked in a cell, perhaps put into
irons. If he proves to be innocent there is nothing to
wipe out the stain, and for years after he is liable to have
a gaol-bird recognise him in the street and say before his
fiiends, “ Wot, don’t yer know me ? W’y, we was in quod
together,” Once I was reporting a case where a young
man was charged with stealing a watch from a drunken
commercial traveller. The young fellow had a few
pounds which were wolfed up by a solicitor in appearing
at five remands, waiting for the prosecutor. When the
youth was finally committed for trial there was no money
left to fee a banister, and the solicitor abandoned him. I
took the affair up out of sheer pity, and at once found
that during the time the supposed robbery was com-
mitted, the prisoner had been “ on the spree ” at a hotel
twenty miles away and had never been in the town at all,
although the prosecutor swore they went for a drive
together. On the day of the trial I brought the landlady to
court, and when the sergeant heard she was a witness for the
defence his rage was boundless. He said: “ How dar 3 r e
intherfere wid this case? Oi blave ye’re in it yerself, and
for two pins Oi'd lock ye up.” He went to the witnesses
and tried to bully them into owning that they were paid
to prove an alibi, but they were square people, and the
prisoner was acquitted. I made a bitter enemy of the
sergeant, who never forgave me, although it was after-
wards discovered that the traveller had sold the watch
while drunk. This prisoner was six weeks in gaol and
had a maddening experience. Shut up in a Cell at 5 p.m.
daily, without light or books, he passed nights of sleep-
- less' agony, with nothing but a blanket and mat between
his bones and the cement floor, and caught a cold which
has injured him for life. Up at five in the morning, he,
a i uuconvieted and innocent man, had to perform dis-
gusting offices and to line up in the gaol yard with the
semirings of the streets ; then he shivered in the cold till
8, when he breakfasted on a dish of hominy, and was
indebted to some man “doing time” for a spoonful of
sugar to sweeten the loathsome mess. He had no books
and no companionship. He could write a letter or tele-
gram, but the gaoler would not send cither for delivery,
as he said “ VYe don’t keep messengers to wait on s
like you.” Worse than all, he had to salute this ruffian
and call him “ Sir,” which was the bitterest pill of
all. “ Brice Waning ” hits the nail on the head when he
says the old convict warder loved to see a gentleman
salute him, and his successor loves it to this day. When
a certain distinguished man was in gaol these little things
were doubtless softened for him, but I think, in memory
of the time he spent in Darlinghurst, he ought to do
something to ameliorate the condition of prisoners await-
ing trial.— Reform.
Consols and Confiscation.
One of the principal troubles of Australia at
the present moment is that it can’t raise any
more loan-money in England, except with great
difficulty and at exorbitant interest. England,
on the other hand, can raise money whenever it
wants it, and its securities are in such an
exuberant condition that it has reduced the
interest on Consols from the miserable rate of
three per cent, to the supremely wretched one
of 2|, without any visible injury to the public
credit. These facts are quoted until the whole
world gets tired, to prove (1) that Australia,
chiefly through Protection, and the formation
of a great Labour movement, and the conse-
quent “insecurity of Property,” is no longer
regarded as offering good enough security to the
British loan-monger ; and (2) that Hingland,
through Freetrade and a strict adherence to
“sound constitutional principles,” is the
grandest and most solvent country on earth.
Both these statements are rampant folly. Aus-
tralia can’t get money because England, in its
general decadence under the Freetrade system,
has no longer any loose cash to lend, because it
has fooled away what spare change it had in
loans at Hebrew interest to wild-cat States
which can’t pay, and because almost all its big
private hanks are on the verge of ruin, and even
the Bank of England is no longer what it seems.
And England can get money still, even at 2|
per cent., because Consols are as truly a forced
and irredeemable currency as the depreciated
paper-money of Russia, or the hopeless bonds
of Argentina, and their price is kept up by
brute-force and nothing else. In England the
investment of trust funds is limited by the
Court of Equity to Consols, Bank of England
stock, and Indian stock. Everybody who holds
money in trust, unless otherwise directed by
the will under which it is held, must put it in
one of these three securities. The only people
who buy Consols are trustees, who do it from
necessity, and if the interest were 2 per cent.,
or 1 per cent., or nothing at all per cent., they
must buy them all the same. There are hardly
enough Consols to go round, in fact, and there-
fore there is a forced competition for the miser-
able British waste-paper, which keeps the price
up to an exorbitant figure. If this law were
repealed, the British 2per cent, securities
would drop like a stone, and if Britain wanted
to borrow, it would probably have to pay 4 per
cent, or go without. And if a similar law were
enacted m Australia there would either be a
revolution or else Australia would he able to
borrow locally all the money it wanted at any
interest it liked to offer.
Mrs. Scarcebkook, of Melbourne, found “not
guilty ” (on the ground of insanity) of having?
while suffering from puerperal fever, murdered
her sou, has recovered her'senses and lias been
discharged from gaol, where she was imprisoned
“ during H.M.’s pleasure.” Up to date, the
invariable practice has hc'hn to remorselessly
keep in confinement for life people who had
committed homicide while suffering from in-
sanity—whether temporary or permanent —the
official idea having, no doubt, been that they
were sure in any case to get mad in the long
run. The Bulletin regards the release of Mrs.
Scarcebrook as an indirect victory for Dr.
Mullen and his colleagues, whose equitable
and common-sense contention that release
should depend not on anyone’s caprice, but
merely on the production to the Supreme Court
of evidence that the prisoner has become sane,
will yet be the law of the land.
Some of the Canadian politicians now say that
the annexation question — i. e. , political fusion
of Canada with the United States, involves a
civil war. The Bulletin doesn’t believe there
will be any war. It believes that Canada will
run off with the United States in the same
natural manner as a woman elopes with another
woman’s husband. But civil war, anyhow, is
the least abominable kind ot military strife,
inasmuch as it must be directed, more or less,
by popular impulses, and express the rival wills
of two strong sections of one people. The
theory that there is something especially
horrible in battles where blood-relations may
chance to fight on opposite sides is merely
pulpit cant. Civil war, by localising human
suffering, tends to keep it limited, as
compared with the woe that results from,
say, a Franco - German slaughter, because
if a son shoots his father when his father
happens to be shooting him, they leave
only one weeping widow and mother between
them, whereas for every brace of unrelated
corpses there must be two separate lots of
family bereavements. Also the corpses in the
one instance have the satisfaction of knowing
that they died at their own voluntary risk for
a principle they knew something of, whilst in
the other case they peg out with a miserable
conviction that they didn’t want to fight from
the beginning, and, by Jingo ! if they did, then
they were ignorant of any reason for wanting
to. These last remarks apply only to common
private soldiers who make “military glory,”
not to the men who give the order and scoop all
the glory after it is made.

Nepotism is spreading in the New South Wales
public service, a regulation to the contrary not-
withstanding. In department after department
one hears of the permanent head being the
superior officer of his own son, or nephew, or
brother. How pleasant for old officers to find
themselves working side by side with the chief’s
son, fresh from school, perhaps, and prone to
tale-bearing and mischief-making ! Of course,
every chief’s sou will not stoop to repeat the
conversation of his comrades to his father : but
it is done in at least several departments. The
spread of nepotism should be stayed, or else the
whole service will he fractionised and its
efficiency impaired. In the Custom House, one
finds a son of the Collector of Customs and a
son of another Customs official. In the Parlia-
mentary departments it is the same. One hears
of a son of the Clerk of the Assembly being
billeted in the Assembly department, and a
nephew of a Speaker appointed almost in suc-
cession to the nephew of a previous Speaker.
In the Council department, a father and son are
employed side by side ; while into the Hansard
department the IT nder - Secretary for Shorthand
has introduced a son with no previous press
experience. How many of these favoured indi-
viduals have passed the Civil Service examina-
tion ?
London Graphic records that a man
named Jobling, hanged in England for killing a
magistrate, was gibbeted (at Durham) as recently
as 1832. The body was escorted to Jarrow Stake,
stripped, covered with pitch, and reclothed. It
was then carefully encased in a framework of iron,
the face being wrapped in a white cloth, and hung
on a gibbet 21 ft. high, and bound with iron
bands. Jobling’s widow has just died at the great
age of ninety-six, and so the last personal link
with the gibbet has been severed.
More trouble. The Bulletin fixed up a
harmless and gentlemanly paragraph, setting forth
that a well-known lawyer was going to resume
“ criminal practice,” and the compositor at once
girded himself up for the fray, and made it read
that he was going to resume “criminal practices.”
Now obviously, if a man “resumes” a thing, it
follows that he has been at it before, and the
ghastly impossibility of the lawyer in question
having ever been in any criminal practices is too
conspicuous to need further comment.
Graham Berry, addressing a mob of kin-
dred souls at one of his farewell banquets, said
“ He felt he had been greatly improved by the
valuable experience he had gained in the position
of Agent-General for Victoria. He was willing
to admit that he was sorry to leave London.”
After which the elderly renegade proceeded, with
a salt tear in his bold, blue eye, to explain that
Premier Munro had offered him a renewal of his
lease of office, but had subsequently withdrawn
the offer, and burst up Berry’s dream of further
improvement and more larks in London, without
a word of apology. Decidedly rough on rats !
Good Graham, we offer our pity,
For pity costs naught to bestow —
From your nest in New Babylon city
You’ve got Jimmy’s order to go ;
So snug was the berth you are leaving—
Light work and such excellent pay—
That we freely believe you are grieving
To find you must flutter away.
You had fairly set up as a Tory,
With a handle in front of i our name ;
You have raved of Himperial glory,
And played the Himperial game
In stockings of silk and knee-breeches.
Does it strike you as vulgarly odd
That you once made Republican speeches
And posed as a democrat god ?
0! no doubt you’ve been slowly “improving”
Through all these respectable years ;
We have twigged that the spirit was moving
Your tongue to beslaver the peers,
Whilst the echo grew fainter and fainter
Of words that you thundered of yore,
When vou talked about “ cutting the painter,”
But dreamed of a knighthood in store.
You are grieved when you think of returning,
For you know that our masses will snort
At the brand who was plucked from the “burning,”
And anon was presented at Court;
You must meet them a month or two later,
And had hotter prepare to he told
That the knight of to-day is a traitor
To the men who “ made ” Berry of old.
Musings in Maoriland.*
Under the above title, Mr. Thomas Bracken, in a
portly tome of 360 pages, presents the world with
his poetical offspring, introduced and preceded by
an historical sketch of Maoriland by Sir Robert
Stout, and a preface by Sir George Grey. These
prose contributions, wo are sorry to note, are all
very well in their way, but a volume of poems is
not a history, and the preface is not wanted
good wine needs no bush, and a man’s verst!
cannot gain in quality by anybody's personal
recommendation. The volume is legibly printed
on good paper, but the typographical ornamenta-
tion is painfully German ; and the pictures, to
say the least of them, might have been consider-
ably more artistic. There is much gilt on the
covers—in fact too much ; but all this has little or
nothing to do with the poems themselves, which
constitute a body of very respectable verse, and—
in a few instances—of very fine verse. In this
collection is printed that noble and deeply philo-
sophical poem, “ Not Understood,” which has
already appeared in The Bulletin, and which,
though well-known, is particularly worth quoting
here :
NOT UNDERSTOOD.
Not understood. We move along asunder,
Our paths trow wider as the seasons creep
Along lire years ; we marvel and wo wonder
Why life is life? And then we fall asleep,
Not understood.
Not understood. We gather false impressions,.
And hug them closer as the years go by,
Till virtues often seem to us transgressions ;
And thus men rise and fall, and live and die,
Not understood.
Not understood. Poor souls with stunted vision
Oft measure giants by their narrow gauge ;
The poisoned shafts of falsehood and derision
Are oft impelled ’gainst those who mould the 0;.,e
Not understood.
Not understood. The secret springs of action,
Which lie beneath the smface of t he show.
Are disregarded ; with self-satisfaction,
We judge our neighbours, and they often go,
Not understood.
Not understood. How trifles often change ns :
The thoughtless sentence or the fancied slight
Destroy long years of friendship and estrange n ,
And on our souls there falls a freezing blight.
Not understood.
Not understood. How many breasts are aching
For lack of sympathy 1 Ah ! day by day,
How many cheerless, lonely hearts are breaking?
How many noble spirits pass away
Not understood?
Oh, God ! that men would see a little clearer,
Or judge less harshly where they cannot see ;
Oh, God ! that men would draw a little nearer
To one another, they’d he nearer Thee,
And understood.
# # *
Mr. Bracken's volume contains dozens of sweet
little lyrics, such as “ Pax Vobiscum ”; in fact,
the poet is, in our opinion, at his best just in
these. His more ambitious verses are somewhat
stilted, and his lays of old days—as “Old Ben-
digo,” for instance—rather bald and forced. The
short poem, “He Profund is,” is full of noble
sentiment, but we would Mr. Bracken had em-
ployed a more serious metre. Some of his longer
pieces breathe a strong martial feeling, and a
reciter anxious to score a triumph with something
new might do much worse than essay the delivery
of “ How Yon Tempsky Died,” and if the said
reciter desired a tale to please a woman’s fancy
“ The Christmas Queen,” a romantic story rhymed
in graceful verse, is ready to his hand. In short ,
Mr. Bracken is chiefly strong in versified narra-
tive, and one short piece like “ Leah ” is worth all
his long efforts like “Jubilee Day.” “Sturt’s
Last Letter” is an ambitious poem, but the
guerdon of the dying explorer’s hope—a knight-
hood —is powerless to move the reader’s sym-
pathy. One can only feel sorry that a great man
could, at the same time, have been so small.
Amongst the versified stories we cannot give the
“ Old Log Hut ”so high a place as “ The Christ-
mas Queen,” for it falls short in artistic treatment,
but it is still very good. Amongst the “serious”
and patriotic poems we confess a weakness for the
little poem to Sir George Grey, in which the great
Pro-Consul is likened unto a grand old tree,
towering high above all other forest-growths, and
giving harbourage and shelter to innumerable
songsters of the grove.
* # #
Undoubtedly Mr. Bracken is, as a poet, far
more successful in versified narrative, and in
philosophical and contemplative verse like “Not
Understood ” and the “ Soul’s Treasury,” than in
historic poems of the “ Jubilee ” character, or in
descriptive poems touching the characteristics
of Maoriland landscape Sir George Grey’s
opinion to the contrary notwithstanding. By the
way, while at this present moment the Anglo-
Saxon world and Mr. Stead are raving concerning
the rights and privileges of Eve’s daughters, Mr.
Bracken in a few verses, yclept “Woman’s
Rights,” reviews the situation from man’s more
romantic point of view—and we should recommend
the shrieking sisterhood and their shriekier
brothers to peruse them. Our Maoriland poet
turns time and again to social questions, and
“Only a Miserable Wretch,” “The Beggar’s
Prayer,” and other pieces, show how much he is
haunted by the evils wrought by man on men. We
cannot admit a special fondness for the “March
of Te Rauparaha; ”an English poem composed of
words from a foreign language. —vide Longfellow’s
“ Hiawatha ” —is unrelishable by the Anglo-Saxon
outsider, and is best summed up in little Martin
Farquhar Topper’s Orphic deliverance anent bon
bon mottoes, “ it may be exceeding clever, but—
ivc cannot understand it.” In conclusion, we
recommend the reader of this short notice to read
Mr. Bracken for himself. The time could be much
less profitably spent, and bis volume is so large
and our space is so limited that we can do little
more than run over the names of a few of his best
efforts.

816 Macquarie-slrcet North, Sydney, January 6, 1891.
My Dkah Mooradinua, —
The whispered Sydney scandal of the moment affects
a, well-known professional man of literary instincts who is,
a hopeless grass-widower—and a lady, of course. Now, he
and she fell in love—and many were the blissful meetings
at an arranged rendezvous, and things were as cuddle-
a.ome as could be until one evening Romeo turned up at
the tryst, but waited, in vain for the Jijliet who never
came. A night of agonised apprehension (please grasp
the fact that he was madly in love with the lady) was
capped in the morning by a letter from her, stating in
curt terms that as she couldn’t marry him she had decided
tp marry somebody else, and had done so the preceding
afternoon. The curtain drops here on a blighted soul,
but rises to discover all the parties at the theatre—the
happy bride and groom sparkling in the front row and
Romeo hovering in the gloomy background and toying
with a shiny revolver. But just as he was about to shoot
a friend who was with him seized his hand in horror and
dragged him away in time to rob the daily papers of the
biggest kind of sassiety sensation, and Romeo buried his
revenge and went home. In scene four all parties are
again at the theatre—Romeo (alone), and Juliet and a
lady friend. Somebody (a man) comes and whispers to
Romeo ; he returns a decisive “ no”; another male Mercury
prattles in his ear—he again refuses ; the third messenger
taps him lightly on the shoulder with a gloved hand—it
is Juliet herself, and he rises, coldly polite, and follows
her. Then in the deserted cloak-room there is a scene
that wants a sassiety novelist to do it justice—a lovely
being in full dress crouching at the feet of the man who
still loves her, confessing her marriage was a mad freak,
and that “you—you only,” &c., and suddenly tearing off
her wedding-ring and swearing to follow him to the end
of the world ! But the flabbergasted Romeo (perhaps he
remembered in time the feather-weight of her former
vows and tears) calmly picked up the ring and returned
it to her, kissing the back of her hand as he did so—and
went out and left her without a word. Beafttifisly
romantic, isn’t it? But I would like to edge in an
expression of deep and honest sympathy for Mr. Juliet.
That matrimony is a very risky operation the divorce-
court abundantly proves. A man was matrimonially un-
chained in Sydney recently, and compelled to pay two
guineas a week aliniohy to his wife. He re-married (you
can’t scare some people), and on his representing to the
court that he was a beggar and a vagrant on the face of
the earth, the alimony was reduced to one pound per
week. I should think that man must hav'e a very fair
idea of what the pecuniary sensations of the Mormon are,
shouldn’t you? and the dreary situation suggests the
query, “ Has a divorced man to pay alimony to his ex-
wife when she re-marries?” I expect he has. The law
always punishes a man who makes a mistake in marry-
ing. Nobody ever hears; of a giddy divorced wife
having to soothe a deceived husband’s feelings at
the rate of thirty. Bishop Smiths a week! she can
wreck his 'appy ’ome apparently and riot among tire ruilis
without being sixpence out of pocket, hut if he plays
tricks with the domestic bliss, the injured dove goes
home to her ma, and he has still to provide the where-
withal to cover its keep. There seems to be no nasty
pride about these unwived wives—they wouldn’t walk on
the same side of the street as the Horrid Brute, of course,
but they take his money all the same. And -the ques-
tion again—if these ill-used angels annex another hus-
band, has the ex-spouse to still keep up his legal
contribution towards the expenses of the new “ men-
agerie? In short, is divorced-wife’s-alimony a grinding,
remorseless tax that only ceases when the undertaker
takes one or other of the parties for a drive ?
Considering that each stuccoed Sydney mansion has
every blind down to notify the owners’ fashionable with-'
drawal into the back rooms or the coal-cellar until the
recuperating season wanes, it isn’t surprising to again
record a disheartening paucity of beauty and fashion at
the last day at Tattersall’s meeting at Randwick. There-
fore I can shriek aloud over nobody’s clothes this issue—
except, perhaps, the draught-board-checked covering of a
fat lady which caused one to abstractedly murmur, “My
move, I believe,” and a brace or two of women with
chalked boots on. Now, I’m not going to gnash my teeth
and foam at the pen over these pipe-clayed hoof-cases.
They’re every bit as magnifying as tan boots, hut
I only mean to protest against, the wholesale way
most of the wearers pitted them against thdir
toilets. Nobody . could quarrel with white boots
fringing a white frock, but when they’re the only white
spot about you, your pedestals seem to rise up and hurl
themselves at the company. One girl in a pink turn-out
finished off with snowy boots reminded me irresistibly of
Galatea before the vivifying process had got to her ankles.
There was no vice-regal pivot for the proceedings to
revolve around, and when the band tooted a bar or so of
“G.S.T.Q.” only two hats were raised in tribute to the
melody.
What “proud-sturamicked” boarders have to put up
with at table during the “ festive ” season is never fully
appreciated by the home-living portion of society. Then
the rich uucouthness' from beyond the skyline swarms
upon the hoarding-house and introduces new manners
that ought to he specially interdicted by printed notices
in the hall. And the tricks of the artificially.physically-
repaired tribe snatch the laurels from the vulgarian who is
as nature arranged him, and who can’t horrify the company
by meditatively taking out a front tooth to get at a fish-
bone, or absent-mindedly remove a natural-looking glass
eye and play marbles with it among the victuals. A
Sydney hash-house had a bad experience on Christmas
Day. The culprit was from the cattle districts and had a
set of brand-new teeth fixe. 1 in for Christmas, and when
be had finished feeding he gapingly unhitched the gold
plate from his upper-jaw and dropped it with' a sigh of
relief into his tumbler of water. Nobody waited to hear
him gummily explain that the dentist had said to be par-
ticular to wash them after special ’ard work.
Women who live in boarding-houses and wear artificial
teeth should curb their passion tor dipping their beaks
"'to scalding-hot beverages, if they want to keep the
fa ity of.their long, yellow fangs as dead a secret as is
possible in a matter-of-fact age where even the adoring
lover, before he commits himself, likes to get his Dulcinea
gazing moon-wards with her mouth open just to see
whether her grinders, are all in situ. But I digress, At
a very swell Potts Point table d’hote the other day, as
Miss Blank (who takes her gargle direct from the flaming
cauldron) let her first boiling sip spread-eagle over her
palate, brittle, cracking sounds were heard in her jaws,
and, lo and behold, every composite tooth in her gold-
harnessed gums was split from root to tip ! I am told
that piping-hot whisky cracks the masquerading masti-
cators quickest of anything, so you should always lock
the cellaret before audiencing any lady whose original
five-guinea set, of, twenty-four is evenly divided into a
toothy fringe of,forty-eight.
Numbers of parents of wooden-headed offspring—who
when asked what they would like to be when they grow
up a big man, respond with a lack-lustre “ dunno ’’—take
their hopeless olive-branches to the bump-prophet o i 1
and over again to find out what sonny is best at, when
sonny ever fails to evolve a future hope except to become
a “bushranger.” The skull scientists must get fairly
tired at these battalions of low-browed brats coming to
have their hollow heads subdivided, and one professor
let his feelings run away with him to a proud papa—a
well-known Sydney solicitor—who wanted him to plumb
the intellectual depths of his son and heir. “ I think
you’ll find the makings of a smart lawyer here, Bumps,”
said the fond father, pushing Billy forward. But after
feeling pause the brain-reader replied: “His bump . f
amaliveness is the only noticeable development. You
might make him a model Mormon.”
A wealthy Australian woman, whose grown-up, sons all
have had a try for the professions, but who have all failed
utterly, and betaken themselves to beet and mutton
raising, has one untried hopeful left whom Nature has

On this outward and visible evidence of water-on-the-

one day be a doctor—“so nice to have a doctor in the
family, you know”—and at afternoon-tea at, a friend’s
house recently, she jocularly tapped Johnny’s swelled
head-piece, saying, “ I'm going to take him to a phrenq
legist—there must be 'something inside all this, and you
shall hear just what the man says.” But the sad part of
it all is that, though Johnny’s culminating bulge was
carefully mapped out by the bump-feeler, the mamma
has never yet divulged what he found there. Another
sheep and cattle man, probably.
Primate Smith (the newspaper godsend of, tjie dull
period) arrived at St. Andrew’s Cathedral on New Year’s
Day, per medium of the box-seat of, a ’bus—ergo, William
Sydney evidently means to tender only legal fares all the
way through ’92—that is, if the Hjelan’ superstition that
“ whatsaver ye dae New Year’s morn ye’ll be daein’ all
the lang year, ye ken,” is true. The good man was
perched on the front seat, with his plump gaiters dangling
in a touch-and-go way over the dashboard. His Episco-
palian gamp acted as a balancing-pole, and he hung on
to a’bus scrap to preserve his equilibrium atop of the
cheap and chippy vehicle.
Any actress who sends testimonials to her ffockist

tipsy emotional genius who re-buttered her probably
unpaid frockist on a square yard of superfine note, which
the gown-manipulator immediately framed and glqed to
her front window, had “bodice ” spelt with two d’s. Let
us hope the bewchus creature had a bad pen at the time.
“ Babes in the Wood ” matineed at Her Majesty’s on

irocks—there wasn’t one of them looked half an inch

the ballet wore dark wigs. Self-gold-wash is evidently, no

They rehearsed everything very carefully for the
“ Messiah “oratorio given at the Tasmanian Exhibition,
on Xmas night, l am told, but what they evidently didn’t
rehearse was the appearance of a baritone singer of a
decidedly Oriental cast of countenance standing in the
front row of the lady chorus and surrounded by lovely
Tasmaniehnes, while the rest of the male singers were in
the misty background miles away from the fun. Under
these Mormonish circumstances it seemed only right to
have the stage draped with the Turkish ensign, since the
baritone heading the beauteous bevy was about as faithful
a reproduction of the Grand Turk and his harem out for
a walk as you could hope for in this outwardly mono-
gamous country.
Somewhere in the Banana region they got up a tourna-
ment, the other day, in which each knight was nominated
by a lad ye, who shrodded her identity under a nom.-de-
theatre (as the women did in ancient times, calling
themselves “Ye Guelder Rose,” and so on). But the
Queensland gal—raised on damper and billy-tea—has a
fine scorn for “ poitry ” when applied to herself, and with
unconscious homage to the eternal fitness of things, wrote
herself down as “Ironbark Emma,” “Ti-tree Tilly”
“Sarsaparilla Sal,” &c.—a long, patriotic list, but with
one exception, She was a long, raw-boned love, hollowed
out wherever she shouldn’t have been, with a camel-like
profile, and loqsely-lixed tomato hair, combined with fan-
like feet and an explosive stutter, and she soared above
the ruck. Her knight scoured round the arena under
the segis of “ Queen of the May.”
A Consul in Australia for a far-away Republic enlisted
in the cavalry of his particular “ kawliny ” on the express
condition that if his nation declared war against An,, i.e
lia he wouldn’t have to fight. There’s about as much
•chance of his country rushing belligerently upon us as
there is that a cat will go for a swim, but the patriotic
Consul hung back until assured that he wouldn’t have to
carve his nearest relatives in the interests of an alien
land, and in the end enlisted in peace. It behoves every
representative of red tape to make a tremendous official
fuss whenever the opportunity presents itself, dontchew-

The evening edition ofj the &M. Herald
departs from the last glimmer of the shore-light
of truth in insinuating that the retrenchment
party in N.S.W. Assembly contemplate a whole-
sale sacking—that is to say, a cataclysm, in which
the worthy and the unworthy alike will be in-
volved, a policy of indiscriminate dismissal. The
Echo declares that the N.S.W. Protectionist
party is. composed of men professing the same
radical views vyhiph prevailed in Victoria shortly
after the Protectionists gained a majority, and
carefully proceeds to prophesy what, in its childish
ignorance of Australian history, it calls “Black
Monday,” Now, as the world knows, a Pro-
tective policy had nothing whatever to do
with . Black Wednesday. Protection has pre-
vailed; in Victoria from 1860 to the present
hour. It was initiated by McCulloch, and
Black Wednesday occurred about 1878, under
Berry’s premiership, and it was brought about
not by Protection—for that was a familiar and
fully domiciled creature-but by the haughty
refusal of the Legislative Council to pass a land-
tax. A deadlock occurred, and Berry, disdaining
to avail himself of the tactics pursued by
M'Culloch during the first deadlock, intimated
that, being unable to pay, the Government must
retrench, anti accordingly dismissed every civil
servant outside the Supreme Court Bench and the
Penal and Police services who could be dispensed
witffi By.this Berry brought the Conservative—
that is to say, the Ereetrade—party to its knees.
Beyond their ordinary concern as gropers in the
quagmire of fiscal discussion, the N.S.W. civil
servants have no more interest in the domination
of either party than have the rest of the com-
munity. It was Sir Henry Parkes who used con-
temptuous language about the “ bitter bread of the
Civil Service.” 'The attempt to set the service
against the Dibbs Government by the wolf cry of
a Black Wednesday is illustrative of the lengths
to which the baffled and defeated Calico Jemmy
party will proceed.

So far as concerns the fire and the
apparitions and the general unaccountableness,
'- lle orthodox pantomime and the pantomime
at Sydney Royal is decidedly orthodox —is
precisely the same thing as opium; tiie present
writer has tried them both, and to this day
he doesn’t know with any certainty which is
opium and which is pantomime. r i’he “Forty
thieves” is filled to the brim with that howling
confusion which is the one great essential in all
such entertainments. It is a misguided ambition
in red paint—an insane panorama in a state of
insurrection—a rush of forty thousand kaleido-
scopes down the gable of a rainbow into
a sea of limelight and baleful green fire.
It is the sort of show which makes one’s
brain dissolve when he looks at it, and rush
foaming down steep precipices in Ids head into
diep, cold pools of disorganised think matter at
t.ie bottom. And withal there is understood
to be a plot in it, but what that plot is no
one shall ever know, for it is more disjointed
•i U | l ra °k e d heretic or a cryptogram torn by
wild horses. It contains shreds an ! specimens if,
everything under the sun, and many other things,
besides; there are dervishes in it,' and mangles-,
and thieves, girls in skirts, girls in huffy things,
that are undefinable, niggers, cockneys, giants,,
dwarfs, Arabs, washerwomen, donkeys, princes,
monarchs that are more or less intoxicated, frantic.
acrobats who swallow themselves and
and then spit themselves out again, and shin up-
nothing into the empty air; bulls, demons, yells,,
armour, bailiffs, princesses, sweet music, groans!,
devils, and a maddening whiz of things in general!.
1 here are any number of good actors in it also*,
but towards the end they are all lost in the general,
not, and no one can tell one from the other; and
there is much lovely scenery, but the mountains
begin to fight in the final delirium, and the trees
rush after each other, and the temples elope and
get tight. And, finally, there is oblivion, and
the writer of this notice slowly recovered his
senses on the pavement for he was giddy and had
pantomime in the head ; and the one thing which
remained distinct in his tattered memory was
that, at some part ov other of the performance,
somebody in the show had hollered “God save
the Queen,” and it had fallen flat. But who
hollered it, or what caused him to holler, is a for-
gotten, circumstance and will remain so unto
seventy times seven.

Fui’ther consideration of “La Mascofcte,”
now doing only reasonable business at Sydney
Criterion, convinces us that this particular opera,
is getting very, very ancient. It is so old,
that one can almost hear its aged joints crack:
in the programme, and the moss and the barnacles
have grown over it, and the footprints of.
primeval man can be seen on the pages-
of the libretta And still it would be a.
gladsome opera to this day, only it is filled with,
old, grey puns, and some of them are very bad,
and some of them are worse, and the rest are
utterly horrible. Nearly everybody considers that..

songs of the heavenly choirs, and the scenery is
beautiful, particularly the far-off glimpse of the
azure mountains and the lakes, seen through the
back-door of the wobblesorne potentate’s palace ;
but despite these things there is still an aching
void and a yearning left unfilled. For we want to ■

The best feature about George
pantomime at Sydney Majesty’s is that it is.
exceedingly like every other pantomime we ever
saw—save one which took fire and fell on top of
the principal funny man. There are whole stacks.
of glittering scenery in it, and they have as much ,
to do with the story as a black Hebrew has with.
Christmas. There are the usual local gags which ,
come in suddenly as if dragged by the hair, after the
mannerof the patent medicine man’s “advt., ’’which:
tells how the villain of the piece was carried down*
Niagara in a boat, and just as he was going over,
a cannon-ball struck him in the wind and blew,
the stolen will out of his pocket and shook it r
into the rightful heir’s back-garden, and then adds-
suddenly that this reminds us of how Smith’s:
porous-plaster is the best thing for groans andl
wooden legs. There are grand spectacular effects
in which 1240 square yards of rage and
clysm and shrieksome frenzy are followed by 1280*
square yards of profound peace and summer love-

liness. And, above all things, there are cataracts
of legs —whole avalanches of extremities —and the
feet have been laid on with a lavish hand in a way
that can’t fail to bring business to a head. The
words, also, are a little less idiotic than usual, but
that doesn’t matter much, for words are really
superfluous in a pantomime. When we write
one there Will be no words in it —only scenery
and clowns and howls, and ic will get there all the
same. The company is good, which is a grievous
waste of genius, for sixty automata and a
cretin have intelligence enough to play out the
best pantomime ever constructed. Also, the
blessing of Allah evidently rests on the limelight
artist and the property man, and the result is a
great and shining success, which makes us wish
in our private capacity that we were dead.

On board the “ Success,” tlie wax convicts
stand silent and dead in their wooden tombs, and
look with dull eyes through the iron bars at the
visitors who come and go. Very grim and reti-
cent are these dank, dead men in rags, who roost
among the shadows like ghosts in a bath, while
their sons and grandsons and their great-grand-
daughters come and look at them through the
keyhole, and refuse to acknowledge the relation-
ship. It is a pleasant thing to stand by and watch
the live aristocrat as he sniffs contemptuously at
his own stuffed ancestor, only it is very rough on
the ancestor. But the ancient plaster argonaut
takes the insult in silence. Probably ho resolves
to lie low till ho meets his descendant in another
world, and then ho will pursue him with a pitch-
fork through the halls of gloom, arid bang his
affrighted ghost in the regions of eternal fire.

CogiU’s niggers, at Sydney Garrick, still
flourish like a green bay tig-tree, and for people
who like this variety of nigger this is exactly the
variety of nigger that they would like. The
house isn’t full, but then nothing is really full in
these times. John F. Sheridan’s Vienna Summer
Garden at Darlinghurst is as bright as before but
it is too soon to decide whether it is or is not to bo
a success. There is always a chance that the fine
old colonial gentrymen of Sydney won’t go to it
unless Jersey distinctly intimates that they may
do so without damage to their poor little stunted
dignity, and when the humble rowdy hears of
anything called a garden he always wants to howl
and blaspheme in it and get up fights. Therefore,
one-half of Sheridan’s patrons may not come, and
he may have to eject part of the other half.

“The Merry Monarch” thrives at Mel-
bourne Princess’, although sassiety is palpably
disappointed in his royal Nibs, Aon see, he is a
small, baldheaded potentate with a sham nose,
and little of that divinity which doth hedge an
ordinary king. His merry monarchy is absolute
in some respects, and the penalty for “ plugging ”
him on his hereditary boko is sudden death, yet
his subjects don’t take their sovereign seriously,
and his foreign policy is hopelessly mixed. An
ambassador from a neighbouring court comes along
with a sweet princess, all gauze and dimples, who
seems well calculated to soothe his Majesty’s
declining years, byt the noble idiot ruins His
prospects of a happy alliance by engaging the
ambassador at single-stick whilst the damsel is
eloping with a pedlar. The king, by the way,
was born under the same star as the pedlar, whose
rumoured assassination at the outset of his elope-
ment is bound to result, according to the local
astrologer, in a royal funeral twenty-four hours
later. Consequently, the king devotes a good deal of
the third act to grieving over his approaching dis-
solution, in company with the astrologer. A special
Act of Parliament provides for the execution of
that miserable star-gazer directly his royal master
has ceased to be a destiny, which probably
accounts for the functionary’s sky-blue complexion
and melancholy smile. Towards the finish,
matters are righted by the restoration of the
pedlar to the soft, round arms of his Princess,
whereupon the King settles down for a further
term of bachelor insanity, and the Court cele-
brates the occasion with a chorus. Regarded as
an opera, “ The Merry Monarch ” is of no con-
sequence. Most of the singing falls to the throat
of Elton, in the name part, and everybody knows
that the range of William’s warble is limited.
The libretto, too, was unfortunately left to the
mercy of the man who wrote “ Evangeline,” and
a plot that offers great opportunities for humour
is spoilt by the author’s inability to put in
worthy dialogue or quaint situations. As
a pantomime, however, the show is fitfully funny,
and Elton does his best to make it go like that
other one-man entertainment, “The Old Guard.”
All the same, he doesn’t quite succeed. The inci-
dental passage at arms with single-sticks is wildly
funny, especially on nights when both combatants
get well set, but almost as much hilarity may be
got out of a clown and policeman when their
eyes are “in,” and the leg of mutton is hurled
with unerring aim. George Lauri, who makes his
first appearance as the irate ambassador, plays a
generally heavy character in a way that promises
well; Howard Yernon, as the astrologer, is a
dismal suggestion of the Lord High Executioner,
in “Mikado,” and Charley Ryley impersonates
the pedlar in a pleasant but perfunctory
nianner. Florence Young is every way charm-
ing when she gets the chance, Violet Yarley
also contributes to the total in a smaller
degree, whilst the general display of limbs and
costumes is noticeable, even just now when the
market is flooded with such goods. Scenery is not
above the Princess’s high average, and a Nautch
dance appeals to the eye of artists who study
curves and outlines rather than to the senses of
the gallery,

At the Alexandra they have been doing
satisfactory business with “Jack the Giant
Killer,” and the efforts of a rather serious-minded
company are requited with whistles that startle
all the dogs of the district from their lairs. Also
the transformation-scene has acquired a certain
amount of romantic interest from the fact that a
demented girl recently poisoned herself all on
account of “Alta” Tischbauer, who painted it.
When limelight falls upon the splendour it seems
like the young person’s radiant smile from realms

The costly, florid magnificence of “ Much
Ado” is duly appreciated at Melbourne Bijou,
where the waits have been reduced to reasonable
dimensions, and the curtain falls upon a lot of.
imminent nuptials on the right side of 11 p.m.
Familiarity with this elegant spectacle breeds
contempt tor nobody but the Divine Bard, a gen-
tleman who was evidently not well up in the
religious etiquette of his period. Otherwise, he
wouldn’t have allowed Claudio and the Prince to
make a disgusting family scandal in a cathedral,
or have imagined the possibility of the chief priest
clearing out with the bride and her father so that
Beatrice might take up a commanding position in
front of the altar and bid Benedick bring her a bit
of the false bridegroom’s gizzard as a love-token.
The scene was an insult to Holy Church, and
absurd, anyway. A couple ■ of vergers or
monks would have run the profaners out of
the tabernacle, and very likely the Heavens would
have tumbled in before the Pope had time to curse
the whole wedding-party off the face of the earth.
This is the Bard’s affair, however. Brough and
Boucicault are not to blame for this absurd row in
the sanctuary. They are, however, in a measure
accountable for Cecil Ward’s hat, which is pain-
fully remindful of a draper’s clearing sale, and for
those same ill-fitting silk knickers that Tithehidge
wore in “Devotion.” No matter. Allowing a
margin for stage license “ Much Ado ” is eminently
satisfactory, although there is nothing in the per-
formance to touch one’s modern heart.

The Age, for some reason or other,
omits to mention the Theatre Royal in its lists of
current amusements, but the big house is crowded
out every evening all the same. David Syme n *-y
ostentatiously ignore the existence of Billee Bar-
low, yet the angel in question is undoubtedly on
the spot, together with Brunton, George Walton,
the fat boy, Whittington’s procession, and sundry
other factors in a large success. The pantomime
has suffered several improvements since Boxing
Night, and owing to the usual curtailment of time
it is now open to any hardy adventurer to stop
and see the harlequinade, a good old chestnut sort
of affair with a highly ludicrous ending. Up to
the present “Dick Whittington” has been beat-
ing all the rival shows by a large majority, so
unless the Age staff get orders to breathe a pestil-
ence into the big house, or set tire to it with their
flaming eyes, the season is very likely to be long
and prosperous. In fact, a Royal pantomime
must be a lot worse than this before it can fail,

George Coppin and his brother directors
of Melbourne Royal have dealt severely with the
free-list, which of late assumed more and more
tlie appearance of a tax levied upon shows by the
local press. A scrutiny of “ names on the door ”
revealed the appalling fact that 1(5 men from the
Argus and 14 from the Age were down as
“ critics ” for those organs, on the strength of one
first notice that is generally regarded as mislead-
ing drivel, followed by occasional paragraphs
which no intelligent reader gives heed to. The
free admissions claimed by a host of other prints,
down to the puniest of weeklies, were even more
numerous in proportion to influence,’ and the
result of this Xmas investigation was an all-round
notice to the-effect that-none but the working
critic from each paper would be welcomed at the
Royal for the next month. Moreover, to avoid
any misunderstanding, the management sent one
ticket for Boxing.Nig.ht to the several editors. In
thus closing the list against lady companions of
men on the job Ooppin & Co. made a questionable
departure from precedent, inasmuch as some
critics require the moral and physical support of
a wife, especially at the pantomime. The intro-
duction of this “one man, one notice” policy
was, however, so evidently the outcome of
a disgusting abuse of the list system that
a sense of common decency should have
persuaded the offending papers to swallow their
corrective pill without a murmur. Evidently
there isn’t much common decency about the
almighty Age, which rose in its wrath and imme-
diately instructed its whole gang of “representa
tives,” including the one man honestly entitled to
free admission, to pay their way into the theatre,
an order which, by-the-by, in nowise altered the
position of thq other thirteen, who were already
barred at the door. So far, so fair. The Age
critic bought his ticket for the Royal on Boxing
Night, and produced a notice strictly in accord-
ance, doubtless, with the merits of the show as
judged by an angry, person of moderate intelli-'
gence. Brethren of the praft who conjectured
that the Age would “slate” the entertainment
were, The Bulletin imagines, founding such an
assumption upon their own inner consciousness of
journalistic etiquette, and not upon .official
evidence. But any Melbournian who oftres to

Coppin has carried his war with the Age
into the enemy’s camp by cutting down the Royal
advt. to two foolish proceeding, anyway.
The Age is without question the best advertising
medium in Melbourne, and if a six-inch, or bigger,
space in other dailies is a good business invest-
ment for the theatre, evidently Coppin must lose
more than David Syme by the reduction of (fie
order in this particular instance. Also, in making
such an invidious distinction between one paper
that butters freely, and another that merely puts
a “scrape” into its notice, the Royal director
gives the public a choice between two surmises—
either that lie is cutting off his nose to spite his
face, or obe that ho regards the cost of all advo v
tiseinents exceeding two inches in each paper as
cash payment for eulogistic notices.

The season of Chinese drama in Melbourne
is bringing out plenty of new talent. A three-act
play of most modern topical interest filled the
Chow bill last Saturday, for instance, and must
have been slung together by some resident genius
within the last month or so. The trouble opened
with the arrival of an English missionary,
his wife, and a brace of redeemed lepers, at a
Chinese town, represented by a few yards of
tapestry hanging from a clothes-line. Presently
a couple of Celestial “slops” slunk to the fore
and arrested the pious Britisher for insulting
behaviour, whereupon one of the converted
heathen slew a “slop” for the advancement of
Christianity. However, the local authorities
grabbed the missionary and put him on trial,
and that was where the real strength of Chinese
drama came in. Virtue wasn’t triumphant.
Nobody turned up to prove - that the mis-
sionary was a decent man in disguise, so that
the Court calmly and monotonously sentenced
him to death. The Emperor granted no free
pardon ; there was no attempt to rescue the mis-
sionary ; his two pet converts silently deserted
him in the hour of trouble, and lie merely died
like a dawg in a barrel full of spikes, with his face
turned to the blazing sun and his eyelids cut off
short. That brought the drama to a plain, prac-
tical conclusion. A missionary had been caught
in the ordinary way, and killed in the usual
manner, and the orchestra celebrated the occasion
bv playing the darndest music ever heard out of
Sheol.

The late Alfred Cellier, as a comic opera composer,
stood in the position of understudy to Sir Arthur Sulli-
van. His music is quainter and more scholarly than such
as Edward Solomon’s, I ut it lacks the deptlFand clever
appropriateness to the text of his patron’s work. Cellier
was very much in touch with Sullivan’s style, however,
and is understood to have filled in bits of musical back-
ground for “lolanthe,” and other of the Gilberlian
series. Cellier, who died at George Mnsgrove’s house in
London, probably succumbed through the bursting of a
blood-vessel.' The poor fellow, one of the most charming
of men, was far advanced in consumption when last he
visited Australia.
Musgrove, says the cable, has engaged Herbert Stand-
ing(Herhert Crellin until liehecame notorious forhis elope-
ment with Mrs. Brown) to support the fair Bernard Beere
on tour. Standing, who is much of the heavy swell, was
manager of the Pelican Club a while back, and seemed to
have left the stage for good. He is a clever, hut decidedly
hard, actor, and about the very best mimic in theperfesh.
An originator of imitations, as you may say. He will,
with a little pressing, give the hoys a brilliant conception
of Elton as Richard the Third, or George Coppin as
burgomaster Matthias.
The Australian Dramatic and Musical Association is to
he assisted by a benefit matinee at Melbourne Princess's
on January 9th. All the local managements are/conspir-
ing to make the show a how ler, and a crowded house
ought to result. Tiie immediate object in view is the
building of a new cottage, and anyone who would like to
contribute a brick or two is exhorted to book a seat
without delay.
Sydney’s partially-built New Lyceum Theatre figured
in the Central Police Ciurt last week in a case of criminal
libel brought by the agent of the ground-landlords
against Mr. J. C. Low- publisher of the Builders and
Contractors News. The article complained of called the
landlords “scoundrels” and “social skunks.” When the
case was called on, Mr. Low made a public apology and
agreed to pay £B4 costs, and, ponding the last condition
being carried out, he was remanded for three weeks.
The Harry Rickards Co. opened at Johannesberg Royal
on 18th Nov. Ip a crowded house. The company includes
Sophie Harris, Nina Tulloch (in her Australian magpie
act, which is a great success), Misses Dewhurst and Raze
(most attractive dancers), Connie Salisbury, Bessie Free-
man (a sweet mezzd-poprano), Vincinni (a clever violin
soloist), and Kate Rickards ; Messrs. Pierce and Sheridan,
and Harry himself, who'has a host of new sketches and
songs. After doing a six w eeks’ season here, they go to
Pretoria, then on to Natal, Port Elizabeth and Capetown,
leaving for x\ustralia in March. In Capetown, seven new
artists will join Harry for his Australian campaign.
Bernard Shaw, in his “Quintessence of Ibsenism,”
cuttingly remarks The ‘dramatic critic’ of a news-
paper, in ordinary circumstances, is at his best a good
descriptive reporter, and at' His worst a mere theatrical
newsman. As such, he is a person of importance among
actors and managers, and of no importance whatever
elsewhere. Naturally, he frequents the circles in which
alone he is made much of; and by the time he has seen so
many performances that he has formed a critical standard
in spite of himself, he has also enrolled among his per-
sonal acquaintances every actor and manager of a few
years’ standing, and become engaged in all the private
likes and dislikes, the quarrels and friendships - in a -word,
in all the partialities which personal relations involve, at
which point the value of his verdicts may be imagined.
Add to this that if he has the misfortune to be attached
to a paper in which theatrical advertisements are an
object, or of which the editor and proprietor's (or their
wives) do not hesitate to incur obligations to managers
by asking for complimentary admissions, he may often
have to choose between making himself agreeable and
forfeiting his post. So that he is not always to he relied
on even as a newsman where the plain truth would give
offence to any individual.”
In company once they were debating who had
played the most characters in “Hamlet,” and some were
inclined to plump for Harwood, but Cathcart rapped in
with his Hamlet, Ghost, King, Polonius, Laertes, Horatio,
Osric, Player King, Rosencrantz, and was going on to the
crack of doom, when they cried—" Hold, enough !”
Fred. Thomas, who used to canoodle through his epi-
glottis, ventriloquially “had the loan ” of many up-country
railway employes, by the aid of his far - away engine
shriek. He would invite the station-master over to
imbibe, and as the liquor was elevated preparatory to
“surroundation,” a screech from au engine would be
heard a quarter of a mile away. The sherbet was
dropped—not inside the diaphragm—and the station
made in even time, amid general laughter. The ruse
worked always.
A necessary preliminary to the importation, by Mus-
grove, of Augustus Harris’ Opera Coy. is the subscribing
of £9OOO cash, in advance, by the Sydney public.

“ His last appearance (meanwhile)"— such was Coppin’s
artless notification about Bentley. The Arlful is no more,
for he always had three last appearances: the last, posi-
tively last, and most positively last, which Coppin made
at the old Queen’s about the year 1842.
Mrs. Langtry has been just 10 years on the stage,
having made her first appearance, in London, in “ She
Stoops to Conquer,” December, 1881. Afterwards Lang-
try acted Blanche llaye, to Mrs. Bancroft’s Mary Netley,
in “ Ours," and was thus auspiciously launched as a pro.
Now it's said she's poor as a rat, and surely she would be
a bigger star for the Australian Tom Tiddler’s ground
than Bernard-Beere.
Lily Pompier wore an air of interesting sorrow at the
inquest on the lovesick servant, and One of the Melbourne
papery ftrfelhssly stated that her evidence was given in n
somewhat mournful voice. Lily can be terribly mournful
without much effort. She suffers so many dreadful
shocks on the stage that sadness comes natural lo the
damsel, anyway. Moreover, in this instance the shock
was vgey real, for Lily hurried from her hath, to find the
poor servant « rithing under the effects of Rough on Rats.
Musgrove’s only fear is that Mrs. Bernard-Beere will
break down. Her health is most delicate, wherefore she
had to give up “ La Tosca ” to Olga Nethersole, and for
weeks she was twixt life and death in the South of Franco.
J. C. Williamson imported Bernhardt, and now Mus-
grove imports Beere. Bernhardt—Beere !

There is grave reason to fear that the damnable heresies
of 19th century latitudinarianism have penetrated
into the S.M. Herald establishment. The attention of
the Chief Inquisitor is respectfully directed to a recent
Echo notice of “ Faust up to Date,” in which the writer
refers to “the immense strides made by civilisation since
the days when the existence of a personal devil was an
article of faith with our forefathers.” This awful insinua-
tion that Au!d Clootie is an allegory or figment of sacer-
dotalism ought to entail a visit of the Pitt-street familiars,
and at least a chastening from the secular hand of “ Mr.
James.” To doubt the substantiality of the devil is
almost as bad as to question the divine origin of Free-
trade, or tire reality of Tophet. Wherefore the Holy
Office should look to’t.
Here is the story of how Parnell’s liaison with
Mrs. O’Shea first became known to certain mem-
bers of the Irish party. After the Phcenix Park
murders, his colleagues vainly searched for him: —
What frenzied consultation —what agonised conjectures
what despairful proposals this time brought forth ! At
last the report came that Mr. Parnell had gohe to Paris,
and some of his colleagues went over there to see hiih.
Mr. Patrick Egan, the treasurer of the Land League, was
a resident in that city at the time, and thus a council of
the Land League could be held there ; but in the hotel
where Parnell was expected to be there was neither trace
nor announcement of him. But several letters awaited
him. There were all kinds of horrid suspicions. It was
known that some of his relatives had ended tragically,
and there was always, in those moments of crises,-the
dreadful feeling that anything might happen to Parnell.
After a solemn consultation it was decided to open some
of the letters, in the hope of finding some trace or clue to
the vanished chief. One of the letters was fiom a lady;
it was scarcely glanced at; but it told enough ; it was the
first warning the Irish party had of the opening of the
tragedy that finally engulfed Parnell and went near to
engulfing Ireland. It speaks for the reticence
and the delicacy which—in spite of all their supposed
garrulousness and the brutality sometimes of their
political controversy—really distinguished Irishmen—
that this fact was never communicated for years after-
wards by the men who knew it, even to their intimate and
close friends in the same party ; and that the vast majority
of the members of the party never heard of it at ail.
It is T. P. O’Connor who tells this. Now, if he
and friends opened Parnell’s letters, the latter
(unless the letters were destroyed and nothing
said about them) must have become aware that
his colleagues shared his secret. However, Mr.
O’Connor says nothing on this point, although it
is a point on which the public have an imperative
right to be informed ; they have also a right to be
informed how it came about that a set of men who
were on merely political terms with their leader
dared to open his private letters at all—especially
private letters addressed in a woman’s hand-
writing. The calm impudence of these people in
now taking credit to themselves for the reticence
they displayed concerning the observations made
by i hem during the commission of a social burglary
is something to marvel at. But whatever the omis-
sions from the littlebook, it is not only admirable as
a journalistic tour dc force, but as a just apprecia-
tion of Parnell’s greatness. The sale of the volume
has been small in Australia, because the Irish, for
one cause, think “ Tay Pay ” could, at this junc-
ture, say nothing but what is bad of the dead
chieftain. The idea is erroneous ; for no book yet
written gives so lucid a revelation of Parnell’s
great heart and intense, though narrow, intellect.

Forster, in allusion to Parkes :—“lt was

Parkes is offering a sham opposition to the
adoption of the Dibbs tariff. His motive is not
quite apparent; but probably he welcomes the
advent of “the creature,” as it will give him a
distinct cry to stump the province on.
The St. Leonards (N.S.W.) Labour Elec-

lock of hair from the tail of the last comet.
John Bray, the new S.A. Agent-General,

early Hinglish associations.
There is only one way to bring about a
union of England and Australia after all. Let
England be dug up and sent out here in bags, and

then the two lands will become one, and the

In certain quarters the question of the
hour is, is Griffith adroitly playing with the Com-
monwealth Bill until Lilley throws up the Chief
Justiceship, or is he doubtful of his ability to carry
the province on his imperial hobby, and still
keep the reversion of the Chief Justiceship in his
hands ?
Munro lost no time in contradicting the
Age’s assertion that Graham Berry was to be re-
appointed Agent-General directly he set foot in
Victoria. Perhaps Munro may further affront
the influential organ by refusing to fulfil its
prediction that he will take over Berry’s billet
himself.
A batch of Hansards, containing McMil-
lan’s, Bruce Smith’s, and Parkes’ speeches, on the

Parkes is, on the whole, acting fairly
up to his declaration of 1887: —“If the Pro-
tectionists be in the majority, I must of necessity
submit; but I shall submit with a good grace. 1
shall know how to submit in all honesty, and with
all decency.” Reid might take a lesson out of his
chief’s book.
In all the Australias, save Victoria and
Queensland, the Chief Justice is Lieutenant-
Governor. In those two provinces, the occupants
of the chief seats on the Bench are too Radical to
be entrusted by the Imperial authorities with
what is nominally the highest position now attain-
able by a local citizen.
Lord Brassey, with whom Parkes, Gillies,
and Griffith are alleged to be acting in concert,
proposes that Australia’s naval tribute to
Britannia shall be quadrupled in the interest of
“the commerce of the antipodes.” And “the
-adequate naval defence ” is to be supplied by
England’s obsolete warships !
The politico-social dynamiters who write

much more honest to sign it “Daily Telegraph.”

Ihe Federal Council of Australia, minus
South Australia and Queensland, goes not a-pic-
nicking this year on the banks of the Derwent,
ihe Council must meet at least every second year,

Missionaries from the New Hebridean
group complain bitterly that the “ French
authorities ’’ are chowsing the pore heathens out of
their land, instead of leaving it to be religiously
acquired by the church. It would seem that the
missionaries have turned up the good work in
consequence. What shall it profit a man to
save the soul of a savage who has lost his free-
hold rights?
The first movement in the direction of
providing the associated capitalists of Australia
with “Pinkerton Guards ” was the enrolment of
special constables (many of them afterwards paid
by Government) during the late strike. The
second step in a similar direction is the engage-
ment by the Pastoralists’ Association of a horde
of private detectives for secret service in Queens-
land and elsewhere.
is it consistent with the spirit of the Con-
stitution that Chief-Justice Darley, a salaried
servant of the State, should hold a commission as
Lieutenant-Governor of N.S.W. ? That a servant
of the Parliament should be superior to the Par-
liament i i surely an anomaly in a democratic

here is the Tory Darley, C.J., employed by

Ex-Governor Caringfcon, a well-informed
London correspondent writes us, has rather over-
shot the mark in England. Even his Radical
friends are blaming him for his blundering tactics
as well as his astounding ignorance of political
history. Granville’s bad policy in dealing with
the colonies is far too recent to be forgotten, and
to say that all the Colonial Office blundering is
the work of the Tories is too strong even for
Radical stomachs.
Sir Julian Salomons is a-recruiting in the
East. It is said that he has paired for all
divisions on the One-man-one-vote Bill. His'
deportment on the Xmas adjournment was racial.
His chief wished the members of the Assembly a
Merry Xmas, but hesaid not a word on the subject to
the political derelicts in the Council. His absence
from the leadership of the Council will be a big
advantage to the Dibbs Cabinet. For Salomons
is a crotchetty character, who can seldom speak
the word that turneth away wrath. On the other
hand, Dick O’Connor is a peacemaker; and his
tact and tongue may avert the threatened strangu-
lation of the Electoral Bill.
The “keystone of the democratic arch”
and Premier Dibbs have drawn their political
swords on one another in the face of the enemy.
The unwitting cause of the estrangement of the
two Protectionists is Major Parrott, an officer of
the Soudan Contingent, whose merits once com-
manded the appreciative attention of Dibbs when
he was sitting in Opposition. Dibbs, it would
seem, promised O’Sullivan that he would find a
billet of some sort for Parrott, who is suffering
from the res augusta dorni. Unfortunately for his
friend, O’Sullivan, in his new-born zeal for econo-
mising the expenditure, ridiculed Dibbs’ military
estimates in the press. This raised Dibbs’ dander,
and lit* lost all interest in Parrott; and now Dibbs
and O'Sullivan are not playing political chaynies.
Dear Bulletin, —The present N.S. VV.
Ministry must not be content to rest under
the cowardly imputations of its anonymous
clerical enemies in the press —to the effect
that because it happens to contain _ two
Roman Catholics (out of nine members) it is
engaged in a corrupt conspiracy to destroy the
secular education system. The, Ministry must be
aggressive : it must carry the war into the camp
of its enemies. It must nail secular education to
the masthead —it must work in the direction of
completely secularising education ; it must make
education absolutely free in order that it may be
justly compulsory. An excellent opportunity of
making a trumpet-like pronouncement upon the
subject will arise in connection with Niuiau Mel-
ville’s free-education resolution. —A.N. A.

supply of infidels is simply ridiculous—only 500
and odd Atheists in the whole country !
You have to look microscopically for un-
believers of any kind in the census, just as in
any church, and the wonder is that Bishop Moor-
house was able to complain, at the Rhyl Church
Congress this year, of the abolition of State aid to
religion in Australia. Now, does not this census
afford convincing reasons why it should be the
last ? Monstrous humbug —no heathens in
the community, the millennium begun! Surely the
denominations themselves ought to scout it, for
even the very gaols are carefully ticketed off into
the 400 sects, with their insects.
If Dibbs requires any warrant for advising
Governor Jersey to increase the strength of the
N.S.W. Legislative Council, it is obtainable in a
despatch by Earl Granville to Governor Bel-
more ;
On certain critical occasions it may become not only ex-
pedient but indispensable to bring the two houses into
harmony by creating or threatening to create, a number
of legislative councillors sufficient for that purpose !
\\ ill the denial of the will of the people, as re-
gards no plural voting, constitute “a critical occa-
sion ?” Anyhow, Dibbs has the authority of
Parkes, as expressed in the Assembly ten years
ago, for appointing 11 additional members. Parkes
has ever contended that the number of Councillors
should keep pace with the number of the people’s
representatives, and that the Council should be con-
stituted so as to give the Government of the day
“afair working majority.”
The cable reports an explosion of gun-
cotton at Dublin Castle “ in a room underneath
the chamber in which the Privy Council intended
to meet shortly.” What is “shortly”? If a
chimney has tottered off its basis and will shortly
fall on thfe head of the man underneath it means
about three seconds, but if the end of the world is
coming shortly it means about 40 billion years.
There is a solemn thrill about the idea of a gun-
cotton explosion underneath a Privy Council that
was going to meet shortly, but after all the
Council might have only intended meeting in 18
months, and an explosion under these conditions
means just as much as a fire in the house that is
going to be built next century. It will probably
be found, when the cablernan gets over the Kris-
mish holidays that the explosion was due to
sewer-gas. The old pile is built on the edge of
the river Poddle, now one of the main sewers, as
the old Tank-stream is to Sydney.
Till a few years ago the N.S. W. Legisla-
tive Assembly regularly declined to consider a
1 rotectionist resolution. A question of fiscal
reform, whenever raised by Buchanan or Melville
—the only Protectionists in the 10th Parliament—
was at once the signal to the Parkesian whip to
organise a count-out. For instance, in 1881
Buchanan invited the House to relieve the
‘farmers, mechanics, and manufacturers from
the pressure of foreign competition,” The House,
after being re-formed four times in 15 minutes,
counted out at 8 o’clock. Of the 111 members of
that anti-Protectionist House only 24 sit in the
present Assembly, 15 on the Protectionist side
and nine on the Freetrade side. And of the 15
Protectionists seven are ministers, and two are
o.beers of the House. Dibbs didn’t sit in the
Parliament of 1881.
J rom the Illustrated Penny Paper :
It is an interesting fact that Lord Rosebery may, if the
Progressives come to power in the County Council at the
next election, bo succeeded by Lord Carington, who has
now developed into a statesman of real ability and mark.
He has lately come out at Bristol as a pronounced
Radical, and he will probably stand for the Hoxton
division of Shoreditch. He is a fresh and brilliant
speaker, full of shrewdness, with good looks, good
manners, and plenty of wealth. Moreover, his ideas have
xr e | n w hol '°. Ugh,y democratised during his Governorship of
JN.b.vy. where he worked in his shirt-sleeves during the
lecent flood to save the people’s homes from destruction,
and made an excellent personal impression all round.
He is a coming man in politics, and I would advise my
readers to keep their e3’es on him.
So, Carington is “a fresh and brilliant speaker ”
—and the British public should keep their eyes on
him ! The Bulletin can understand the English
admiring and trusting the easy and spontaneous
Rosebery, wit, scholar, and sportsman, a man
among men. But that a big nation should be
solemnly told to “keep its eye” (in such a sense)
on the heartless, tricky, shallow, downy, trans-
parent Carington—fangh ! The illustrated paper

Editor Fitchett, now back in Australia,
couples the present financial attitude of English
capitalists towards Australia with Australia’s
dramatic intervention in the London dock
strike.”
A returned Maorilander thus delivers
himself in an Auckland (M.L.) paper:—
During iiiy stay in Sydney I tried for two and thirty
situations that were advertised in the local papers. lii
one instance there were no less than 1700 applicants for
one situation ; in another there were 430 applicants. T
could keep on enumerating similar cases where there
were hundreds after the same situation. I met lots of
Maonlanders unable to obtain any work, and who
would give their labour free over there to obtain food
alone. Hundreds sleep in the Domain at night. I saw
advertisements where young men were offering their
li r? ur for foo( * a l° ,le - One advertisement ran thus •
Distressed, will give his labour free for food alone.”
Although I have travelled in different parts of the world
I have never seen so much poverty as I saw durin°* mv
stay in Sydney. Sydney is a fine place, there is not the
least doubt about that, but men cannot live without
employment; and should any of your numerous readers
want to better themselves, do not go to Sydney, I say.
Robert Reid, Melbourne warehouseman,
has left for England to represent Melbourne
Chamber of Commerce at London Conference of
the world’s Chambers of Commerce, and this is
what he says he is going to say
The feeling of every true Australian is as truly British,
and with the old country we shall sink or swim. lam no
separationist, nor do I believe in the idle talk of people
who suggest that one day the two countries will part
company.
In other words, Reid enthusiastically refuses to
accept the lessons of history. He is an imported
article who visits England too often and has
become wealthy too rapidly to become politi-
cally acclimatised. He no more represents
Australian public opinion than General Gourko
represents the public opinion of the Russian
steppes.
A social difficulty of the same old des-
cription is reported from Brisbane. A legal
gentleman got married a short time ago, and
built a bower for himself and the object of his
affections not far from the shining river, so that
they could embrace each other in the garden on
dark evenings, and listen to the gentle murmur
of the stream. He had been in a state of profound
joy for a few weeks, and then one day he was
telephoned for _at his office, and urged to come
home on the instant to avert murder and un-
speakable horror, because a strange female wanted
to scatter his wife on the doorstep. He went
home at a run, and found that anarchy had
broken loose. There were a woman and four
children in hysterics in the garden, and the
woman was trying to shove the offspring through
the keyhole, and claimed that the house and the
husband were both hers, and that she was a
deceived widow whose life had been laid waste.
The door was locked, and a pallid bride was
looking with a glassy expression through the top
window. The bride’s mother, who had evidently
been sent for by way of a reinforcement, was
expostulating through another window, and the
slavey was giving “back talk” to the enraged
visitor from the further side of the keyhole. The
bower, in short, was a desolation, and’ just as the
owner rushed through the gate the woman in the
front garden began to tell things about his past
life which made the blood of the whole neighbour-
hood run cold. He headed her off in the midst of
her revelations by means of a £2O note, and she
retreated sobbing down the road with the four
children, and then he went in and tried to explain
things to the family. But somehow the bower
has never been the same since that visitation, and
apparently it never will, for the trail of the
visitor is over the flowers and their bloom has
departed.

During 1891 three members of the N.S.W*
Assembly died, and one got seven years’ “hard.’
Dan. Mayne, of Bathurst (N. S. W.)
Sentinel, has christened his youngest son Bis-
marck.
O’Grady Rose, associate of Judge Moles-
worth the first, is dead. He was a witness in
the Ireland divorce-case.
Lord Gormanstown, one of the poorest
Irish peers, is named as the successor to Lord
Onslow as Governor of Maoriland.
A grandson on the male side of the first
Governor of South Australia, Captain Hind-
marsh, is vine-growing at Pokalbin (N.S.W.)
Of the committee formed to promote a
memorial to W. B. Dailey, no less than eight have
followed the “ shirt-sleeved Csesar ” to the silent
land.
It is said that the late Alderman George
S. Davidson, of Sydney, never once smiled since
Abigail’s bank, of which he was for a short time
director, closed its do irs.
Parkes is furious at the comments made
in the press concerning the .£ll,OOO contract made
with sculptor Simonetti for a statue of Governor
Phillip, the first principal-gaoler of N.S.W.
David Christie Murray made H. W. Lucy
one of his meanest heroes, “Mr. Amelia.” Lucy
n ,,w revenges himself upon Murray in the column
(,f trossip lie contributes to the S.M. Herald.
The widow of Surgeon Busby, of the
“System,” still lives in tier old-time house on
.birdan Creek at Bathurst, and enjoys excellent
health, notwithstanding her more than 90 years.
The new N.S.W. District Court Judge,
Mr. Gibson, began his legal life as associate to
Mr. Justice Windeyor. It is good to take your
liw fro n that Judge. But not your judicial
manners.
Bir William Hoste, the racketty young
English baronet who, when in Australia a few
years ago, married a fascinating young Sydney
hv.lv widely known as “Tommy,” has become
bankrupt.
Mr. John Hay, who succeeded to the
great Berry Estate at Coolangatta, by the death
of his relative David Berry, which has made him
a millionaire four times over, was once a poorly-
paid junior in a Sydney softgoods house.
There are nine Johns and nine Williams
in the N.S.W. Legislative Council. The Georges
come next with six, the Henrys with five, and
the Jameses and Charleses with four each.
“ Jerry ” Bundle and Alban Riley stand alone in
their glory.
Stead says the late Hon. W. H. Smith
had not a spark of genius, but did his duty
according to his lights. This is a roundabout
way of saying that Smith was a fool for refusing
to sell Stead’s “Maiden Tribute” pamphlet on
his bookstalls.
A University man has just risen from the
ranks of the N.S.W. police to the position of sub-
inspector. The superior qualities of the graduate,
as displayed in official communications, attracted
the notice of Mr. Fosbery, and promotion rapidly
followed. One case of promotion by merit in
N.S.W.
Mr. Evelyn Snodgrass has taken holy
orders at Melbourne. He is a son of Peter Snod-
grass, an old-time Victorian legislator, and
grandson of Colonel Snodgrass, who was Acting-
Governor of N.S.W. between the departure of
Governor Bourke and the arrival of Governor
Gipps.
W. Hammett, in 1830 leader of the Dorset-
shire revolt against the introduction of farming
machinery, and sentenced to transportation for
life to Australia, after serving many years of his
sentence was released and returned home a
broken man, to end his days in the poorhouse.
His death, after years of pauperdom, has just been
announced.
Old Bill Crook, a well - nigh forgotten
murderer, died in Geelong Gaol last week, aetat
80. The gaol at “ the Pivot ” is a sort of
Benevolent Asylum for used-up assassins, and in
the “ lifer ” yard of that drowsy institution you
can see groups of mild-looking ancients, each one
of whom bears the brand of Cain covered by warts
and wrinkles.
People who perceive omens in royal titles
will expect Clarence “ Collars and Cuffs ” to die a
miserable death, and brother George of
Kent) to beget his father’s successor to the Throne.
But probably no successor will be called for.
Albert Edward has himself declared, in a wild,
unguarded moment, that he doesn’t expect the
British Monarchy to see him through to his royal
end,
Bingham Crowther, physician, “ etc.,”
who has, to the dismay of Hobart society, been
captured at Colombo, many years ago assisted his
father, Dr. W. L. Crowther, to plagiarise the
head of the last Tasmanian male aboriginal,
William Lanne, who died in the hospital. There
was much fuss and scandal over the matter at the
time, and the Crowthers got what they required—
bold advertisement.
H. J, Wrixon, of Victoria, and John
Colton, of South Australia, have been officially-
damned this week with the title of K.C.M.G.
Also, her Majesty has been graciously pleased t<>
partially damn Captain Moore and E. G. Fitz-
gibbon with the title of C.M.G. In other words,
the British monarch has branded Wrixon and
Colton in front with a large hot flat-iron, and has
branded Fitzgibbon from behind with a small one
that wasn’t quite so hot.
G. H. Haydon, discoverer of Gippsland
from the Melbourne side, died in London on 9th
November, aged 70. He was once secretary to
the Bridewell and Bethlehem Hospitals, and
arrived in Melbourne in 1839. A sketch he made
of Melbourne in 1840 is familiar in engravings.
He went with a party to Gippsland, struck the
coast opposite French Island, returned to England
in 1845, and published in 1853 a book called
“Five Years in Australia.” Thenceforward he
devoted his mind to the antiquities of London.
It is related of the late millionaire John
Harris, of Shane’s Park, N.S.W., that he once,
because of personal hate, spent £5OOO in defeating
a namesake for West Sydney, when he made one
speech, as follows Well, boys, you all know
me, and the only speech I’m going to make to
yer is. ‘ Come in, an’ have a drink.’ ” The
Cumberland Times, published in his recent locale,
gives the old man an unlovely character in the
main and says that when urged to make a will he
invariably replied; “Divil a bit o’ a will I’ll
make. Let the s fight for it when I’m done
wi’ it.”
When Queen Victoria went to Paris, in
Napoleon lll.’s time, she was gorgeously enter-
tained at the Hotel deVille. M. Baltard was an
important fussy personage there, a sort of Fitz-
gibbon, and beseeched M. do Moray beforehand
that be might be presented to Victoria, in the
ceremonial, but de Moray said Victoria bated

beards, and Baltard’s was very magnificent. So
he shaved it right off, clean as a comedian, and
stood in a good position at the presentation, but
never could catch the eye of the M.C., who
didn’t know him so altered. Says the. M.C.
afterwards, “You’ll have to wait till next time,”
and the ladies of Paris presented Baltard with

Wo have received the following letter,
si gin d by “Mary Roberts” and “Win. Roberts”: —
Editor Bulletin, —Owing to a malicious letter appearing
in ,\our journal of 2SUi Nov., signed by “ S.K., ’ reflecting
upon the action of the friends of the late J. O. Wascoe
in “ ignoring their late relative’s wishes hy burying him
in the C.K. cemetery,” we most emphatically repudiate
“S.E.’s” assertion, and are prepared to disprove the
statement. As a matter of fact, Mr. Wascoe died a
Protestant, which faith he had always followed. This
fact alone precluded any such wish being gratified, even
had it been expressed.
Mesto i is making another expedition to
the Bel ten den Ker Mountains, accompanied
this time by the two Italian collectors to
whom he is acting as cicerone. A prophet
is unhonoured in his own country, and Cairns
people do not read Meston’s rhetoric with the
enthusiasm of Southerners. Hp was dilating
the other day on the difficulty of his famous
assent, and calculating the obstacles to its repe-
tition. “Why don’t you take a couple of pack-
horses?” said Jack O’Leary, the clerk to Cairns
Divisional Board, “ there’s a good track clear up
to the top.”
One Bailey is reported to have picked up

An ingenious London expert, who has
made a study of the legal tests applied to deter-
mine the genuineness of milk—fat solids and solids
other than fat, &c.—has invented a fraud that
beats the analysis every time. By adding a-third
of “ separated ” milk to a quantity of new milk,
the mixture keeps the standard of “fat solids,’’
lyut has such an excess of “ solids other than fat ”
that it will receive about 5 per cent, of water and
then answer all the test conditions. Thus, 300
gallons of new milk, plus 100 gallons of separated
milk, plus 20 gallons of water, can be legally sold
as 420 gallons of wholesome new milk that will
satisfactorily respond to all the legal requirements.
A law has been passed in New York State
whereby a tombstone-cutter, if his bill isn’t paid
within six months after the funeral, can root up
the emblem of grief from its place above the dust
of the deceased, and dispose of it as lie thinks
best. This is a good move, for it isn’t nice to see
insolvent tombstone-cutters gritting their teeth in
the cemetery, and shaking their bony fists at the
inscriptions above the unpaid-for dead. And
another good idea would be toauthoriae any dentist,
who can’t get his money, to call round at the end
of a reasonable period, and take back the gold
stopping that he put into his customer’s molar.
Think of the rage of the dentist who gets into a
jovial company of (say) seven, and knows that six
of them are smiling with his teeth ! How he must
long to get up there and then, and seize the whole
six sets, and depart with them, leaving his un-
profitable clients to grin on a cash basis with their
own shrivelled gums !
Starting with a capital of £17,000,000, the
associated banks of Australia have, in one genera-
tion, divided £50,000,000 among their shareholders
and accumulated a reserve-fund of £31,000,000.
The Tasmanian silver-mines, at Zeehau
and Dundas, have up to now almost ruined every
Tasmanian who has touched them. A month ago
it was unanimously agreed, at meetings of the
various companies, to suspend operations sine die,
and it was stated that the total amount, in calls,
amounted to £25,010 or £30,000 per month. r i his
was too much for the pockets of the Tasmanians.
The Silver Queen Mine is the only one that has
paid a dividend, add this a very small one.
Remini is the nearest port of shipment, situated
12 miles from Mount Zeehan, and £7 10s. is paid
for carting ore this distance, over a road 12 feet
wide, which for nine months in the year is a
floating mass of corduroy. The Silver King
Mine, upon which is erected the most expensive
and complete machinery on the field, is still sink-
ing in search of the lode. The shares of this mine
which a short time ago were quoted at £llO arc
now selling at £4(>. One of the “ biggest jobs ”
ever perpetrated in the Australian colonies is the
construction of the Zeehan-Strahan railway-line.
A Black-tracker—Crick.
Sydney D.T. remarks solemnly (at the
instigation, no doubt, of some land-grab mis-
sionary or other) that the French are acquiring
“large tracts of land” in the New Hebrides by
“questionable means.” If the D.T. can point
out any large tract of land that was acquired any-
where by any other means, this paper will eat its
printing machine.
A Tasmanian Judge lately sentenced a
Chinaman to 10 years for causing the death of an
old woman of 70, by beating her. The old lady
was stealing John’s cabbages, in the middle of the
night, and the Celestial evidently never meant to
kill her. When sentenced, John said, “Ten years
too muchee, inuchee.” The noble and upright
Judge’s admonitions to the poor devil (who, by
the way, did not understand English !) were a
caution to snakes.
A Melbourne detective, accused of being
drunk when he appeared before a board of inquiry
the other day, explained that his state of fuddle
was the result of a long search for “ information,”
during which he “ had to do a great deal of treat-
ing.” So many people ’ad a glass along o’ ’im
that the liquor ultimately got into his gigantic
brain, and there wasn’t sufficient time for him to
sleep it off before facing the aforesaid board.
Under these distressing circumstances the tec’s
trifling indiscretion has no doubt been pardoned,
but the question naturally arises—what is the
precise value of “information” collected by an
active and intelligent officer when he is drunk?
Ah Kim, the Cooktown Chinese trader
who was murdered some time ago on Normanby
Island, appears to have met his death through his
irresistible personal attractions. It seems that
the wife of a local native, named Gumamumunuia,
saw Ah Kim, and at once was smitten by him.
In an evil moment she confessed to her husband
the fatal passion that Ah Kim’s charms of person
had roused in her bosom. Whereupon Mr.
Gumamumunuia, accompanied by five or six
friends, boarded Ah Kim’s vessel to remonstrate
with him. Poor Ah Kim, quite unconscious of
the havoc he had caused by his good looks, was
quietly coming out of the hold of his little craft,
when Mr. G. thrust a spear into his back. Ah
Kim managed to get hold of his gun, and G. and
his friends went over the side, but the gallant
Chow contrived to pot one in the water. His
crew sailed the vessel to Duchess Island, where
he died of his wound. Good-looking men stand
no chance in New Guinea. How, we wonder, did
the late Baron Miklouho Maclay escape ?
At a London inquest the other day it came
out that Edward Haynes, 50, cooper, out of work
and friendless, who died of pneumonia (conse-
quent on exposure) in the workhouse, had walked
from Tunbridge Wells in search of work and had
slept for six nights at the Congregational Union’s
free shelter. An attendant at the shelter deposed
that there were 200 men there every night. “ They
had no covering except what they took with them.
There were chairs for them to sit on, or they
would lie on the floor. Being asked by the coroner
if there were plenty of customers even for this
accommodation, the witness created a sensation
by replying, ‘ Yes, sir; we turned away 00 last
night.’ The shelter, supported by private sub-
scription, is merely to prevent men lying about
the streets, and the occupants, it appears, have
no food given them except on Sundays, when the
number reaches 400. The majority are dock men.
One hundred thousand persons were in the shelter
from January to October.” In the same paper it
is recorded that in a burglary case, the prisoner
said that he came out of gaol on the oth of the
month and on the loth he committed the crime.
He could get no work, and had taken the boots
off his feet and sold them for eightpence to get
tea. Do you not marvel at the patience of the
dogged Englishman ?
To counteract the enervating, relaxing,
and evil effects of the heat and depressing nature
of the climate in this country during the summer
months, no remedy has ever appeared before the
public to equal, or even that would bear com-
parison with, Clements Tonic. It prevents fever,
malaria and ague, keeps up the appetite, assists
digestion and assimilation, stimulates the stomach,
liver, kidneys, and bowels; thus preventing liver
and kidney disease, and warding of their un-
pleasant symptoms, as headache, constipation,
piles, gout, rheumatism, dropsy, apoplexy, &c.
The summer is the time when Clements Tonic is
the medicine par excellence for the people. It
prevents the relaxation and depression so prevalent
in the hot weather in these latitudes; it enriches
the blood, aids perspiration, and restores all lost
nerve-power; is the only reliable anti-febrifuge
and pick-me-up prepared in the colonies, and can
be depended upon to do good and cure disease.
The action of Clements Tonic is certain, sure, and
prompt; relief is felt immediately after taking the
first dose; it acts direct on the seat of disease
and cures the cause, and then the effects of that
cause cease. Most other remedies offered are
prepared with a view of treating the symptoms,
consequently, as soon as the effect of the medicine
passes away, the trouble returns, and the patient
wants another bottle of medicine. This may be
very good for the maker of the remedy (?) but it is
not at all satisfactory to the patient. Clements
Tonic positively, effectually, and permanently
cures; it does not only relieve, like most of the
narcotic mixtures sold, but radically effects a cure ;
and if the patient only avoids the source from
which he or she contracted the illness in the first
place, a relapse is impossible. Moreover, Clements
Tonic does not constringe the gastric vessels of
the stomach or cause indigestion, and will not
injure nor discolor the teeth. Can any rival pre-
paration say the same?

Two absolute essentials for the existence
of the human race are—land and air. Many
economic and political systems have been invented
and are advocated for obtaining land for each
individual to live upon, but it has been left to the
Hydraulic Cooling and Ventilating Co. to intro-
duce pure air into every habitation in Australia,
by means of their “Perfection” Cooler and
Ventilator. By attaching this machine to your
water supply or tank, and simply turning on the
tap, a constant stream of pure, fresh air can be
obtained in any chamber you desire. Punkahs
are thus superseded, perishable goods can be kept
at a small expense without ice, and you can enjoy
the luxury of. a cool chamber on the hottest day or
night. The machine, which is simplicity itself,
works at the cost of one half-penny per day, while
the price brings it within the reach of most.
Send for particulars or inspect the machines work-
ing in our offices. T. A. Knight and Co., St.

The Sydney cabmen won’t call a shilling
“a bob” any more. They’ll call it “a Bishop
Smith.” Just you see.
* * *
Primate Smith’s predecessor of yore, Dr.
Barker, who went to Heaven long ago, was so
abnormally tall that (incited thereto also by the
fact that he was a teetotaller) the tavernites called
the “longest” drink of beer procurable at a
public-house “a Bishop Barker.” Better be the
godfather of a long drink than of a short fare.
# * *
Primate Smith says that he won t give a
cabman more than his fare, because to do so
would be unjust to poorer people. Poorer people !
Who should be poorer than a Christian bishop?

Sample from an Australian gubernatorial
school prize-day speech : —“ Either in learnin’ or
in teachin’, people cannot be too careful about
speakin’ English correctly.” Our statesmen can’t
manage their aitohes. Our Governors don’t
manage their “g’s.”

Apropos a variety of things. It doesn’t
look well for a Minister to grant a pretty
civil servant a post far above the standard of
her certificate—especially if he and she happen
by the merest accident to live under the same
roof. Nor, when a newspaper offers a prize for a
literary effort, does it look well to see that prize
awarded to anyone within the “office ” circle.

At the Wilson-Churchill wedding in Eng-
land, Sir Salmon was surrounded by royalties and
half the British peerage. Happy man! He gave the
bride a marriage-present as vulgar as his own
flame-coloured whiskers : a gold toilet-set, “ which
included, besides the usual gold-stoppered bottles
and boxes, a gold basin and jug and a large gold-
framed mirror for the dressing-table.” The
cataloguer here pulls up suddenly.

Remark made for the benefit of anyone
whom it may concern. When once an editor
takes to wearing a revolver regularly, he must in
the long run shoot or be shot. The man who
presents a revolver signs his own death-warrant
if he misses or his enemy shoots first and straight.
Are we going to acclimatise the variety of
newspaper man ?

Extract from police report in Melbourne

At last week’s meeting of the South Mel-
bourne (Larkin) Building Society one of the

look out for the shareholders, who don’t get a

The Sydney public wants a rest. It is
tired of having fired at it, in season and out of
season, in the social column of every newspaper
published in the city, the names of a pair of
people whose one object in life would appear to be
to attend every “ function ” and get an advertise-
ment out of it. The much-printed pair may be
“well-connected,” but neither of them is at all
interesting, if one overlooks the fact that in the
male can be seen the best and finest example of
vapid ignorance, brazen front and ghastly snob-
bery south of the equator.

A writer in a Sunday contemporary,
deploring the hard lot of the Murrumbidgee
settlers, states that these latter are chiefly
Germans, and that their distress is so great that
women have to work on the farms. Wherever the
Germans are settled the women have to do quite
their share of “hard graft.” We have sat on a
fence and smoked with a fat German gentleman,
in the Wimraera district, while his wife was
ploughing in Wellington boots.

When Sydney Water and Sewerage Board
want to intimate to a citizen that he is expected
to pay some rates, they just send him a summons
carrying costs. The Board doesn’t believe in
preliminaries. It only believes in bailiffs. It is
true that if you remonstrate, the officials swear
that notice has been served, and cases have been
known in which dirty, trodden-on pieces of blue
paper bearing certain more or less legible inscrip-
tions have been found on office-floors, near the
front door. However, the Board is apparently
not bound to have the notices handed to anybody.
Its work is finished when it slips a bit of flimsy
under the mat at midnight.

The Rockhampton (Central Tophet) Hos-
pital Committee lately reduced the pay attaching
to the responsible office of resident surgeon (a post
very different from a city resident surgeonship)
from ,£750 to £GOO, and then to £3OO, wherefor
they are rated in no measured terms by Dr. J. A.
Langdon, who, however, remarks that, as there
are many impecunious medicoes seeking for gore
and the petty glories of an official position, the
ignorant and bumptious committee will have no
difficulty in finding a man to suit them.

A Bulletin correspondent insinuates that
it has taken the N.S.W. Board of Health authori-
ties five months to erect at Little Bay a cottage
for the accommodation of a leper ; also that when
the Board “ isolates ” a leper in his own house it
allows him to walk round the sti’eets at night.
“THE IMMIGRANTS AT HOME AND ABROAD.”
APPLICANT : “Let me in, for God’s sake, I haven’t tasted food for 12 hours, and my

wish ye a happy new year.”
Nothing like having two strings to your
bow. Sydney Evening News is just now profes-
sing strongly democratic tendencies. The Illus-
trated Sydney News (published from the same
office) is devoted to the glorification of wealth and
militarism, and is eternally printing gigantic
portraits of fat swashbucklers with weak chins
and with large feathers in their hats. It gives a
solid support to the N.S.W. “ National” Associa-
tion, established to dish the Labour-party !

The boss policeman down at South Mel-
bourne is said to be .£BOO the poorer by Larkin’s
embezzlements, so it seems probable that Matthias
hasn’t been getting so many indulgences in gaol,
after all. Yet “quod” is the most comfortable
place for him under the circumstances. There
are at least two old men prowling around with
firearms concealed about their persons, and stating
that as they haven’t long to live or any money
left to live with, they would be glad to get one
pop at their old pal, Matt., and then retire upon
the consequences.

The magnates of the N.S.W. civil service
managed to keep very quiet the story of the gen-
tleman (now in “ quod ”) who first forged his way
into the Lands Office, then transferred himself
per medium of a forgery to the Audit Office, and
finally (through one of those stupid blunders which
are made by even the sharpest men) forged his
way into gaol. To do the gaol authorities justice,
they were so afraid that he would forge his way
out of gaol that they kept him away from pens
and ink. Another N.S.W. Civil Service story
about which the public know little is that of the
gaol-official who, not long ago, was found em-
bezzling quite a lot of money and was simply
dismissed—for how can you punish a man who
steals in gaol ? Perhaps, however, a man can only
endure imprisonment in his own gaol.

Two sisters were committed for trial for
bigamy at one sitting of the Redfern (Sydney)
Police-court last week. One of them pleaded that
she had received from her husband —against whom
she held a protection-order—a letter (produced)
allowing her to marry whom she pleased. This
miserable woman has offended against the law,
but has, morally speaking, been guilty of no
crime. The woman who has to be protected
against her husband should be set free. If N.S.W.
had an equitable divorce-law she could have re-
married without risk of a bigamy prosecution.

Belle Bilton Clancarty lias supplied a
tender, romantic sequel to the Dunlo divorce-
case by presenting her reconciled husband with
twin boys. Seeing that the young man has
succeeded his pig-headed father and Belle wears
a “coronick” the twin that took the lead in this
little matter will be Lord Dunlo, always provided
that nurse doesn’t “ mix them babies up,' in
which case the last may go first without making
much difference to hereditary legislation. Mean-
while one would like to hear what Wertheimer
the lady’s former protector, afterwards the co-
respondent, and finally a friend of the noble
family, has to say about the noble event—
Death has entered into mimic life, with
a tragedy in the Dampier household at Mel-
bourne. Selina Palmer, the lady-help, slays her-
self with Rough on Rats, through unrequited, and
indeed undisclosed, affection for Alfred Tisch-
bauer, the Alexandra scenic artist. The most
terrible interposition of the real into the ideal
was when Federici died suddenly, as he descended
the trap as Mephistopheles, at the Princess’. A
pretty blonde on the Collins-street Block, now
getting rather ancient, had a strange experience
when engaged as a child in the pantomime ballet
a hoy, aged 14, committed suicide on her
account, Garrity, a lad of 15, Hung himself under
the train at Richmond (Melb.), and was killed,
through unrequited love, while another remark-
able Melbourne suicide (that of a little South Mel-
bourne boy) was by drowning, through love of
Ftmlie Melville, and this in her later days.
Fannie has been fatal at all ages to males of all
ages.
Bingham Crowther, the absconding Hobart
medico, was a regular proraenader on the Block
during his stay in Sydney. This foolhardiness is
thoroughly characteristic of the Crowtherian
character, in which prudence or diplomacy has no
place. “Bing.,” as ho is familiarly called by
Hobart folk, is a handsome, dashing fellow, like
his big brother Ted—also a medico, and an M.P.
to boot. In Sydney, as in Hobart, many a lass
craned her neck to catch a fuller glimpse of
Bing.’s bright features. With the exception of
shaving off his beard, Bing, hardly took any pre-
caution to conceal his identity from the dunder-
headed detectives of Sydney. For several days at
least he rubbed shoulders on the Block with the
police and the detectives. And but for the arrest
of Crowther at Colombo the writer would not
have chronicled this item for the edification of
Chief of Police Fosbery. The Tasmanians resem-
ble the Scotch very much in the canniness of their
disposition. Hence the non-revelation of Bing.’s
presence in Sydney. Several Hobartians on the
Sydney press could, if they chose, point out the
big hotel which Bing honoured with his patron-
age. But what surprises his countrymen in
Sydney is* that he didn’t sail out of Sydney in a
deep-sea boat.

So far as we know Parkes has only written
to The Bulletin once, and that was to deny that
he had any hand in passing the infamous N.S.W.
Treason Felony Act —although he occupied the
office of Colonial Secretary when it was enacted !
With regard to an article in a Sydney Sunday-
paper stating that the lunatic O’Farreii’s brother
was a clerk in the Victorian Lands Department
who embezzled a lot of money, the statement is
incorrect. Hugh James O’Ferrell, the clerk
referred to, was a West Indian with dark blood in
his veins, and in no way related to O’Farrell. Nor
did O’Farreii’s sister marry a certain celebrated
V ictorian cricketer, whose name it is unnecessary
to mention here; that cricketer’s wife is the
daughter of a well-known Western district settler.

One of the thrilling features of prison-life
in a certain Australian province is to see a judge’s
wife dropping in affably at the gaol to exchange
small talk with a very swell prisoner, a private
room being set apart for their meeting so that
they may not be disturbed. And another thrilling
feature is to see the distracted wife of a poor and
unfashionable prisoner applying for permission to
see her husband—who is in thesame gaol for ex-
actly the same offence as the criminal dude afore-
mentioned —and being told in a hard, brass-toned
voice at the gate that it is “agin’ the regula-
shuns,” and that she can’t be allowed in. If this
Most noble Clanoarty, you fortunate party,
You lucky, twice lucky, young Earl!
No Bacon or Milton his hopes could have built on
A wiser foundation of girl.
When Belle you were ringing, remarks very stinging
Were made, and men called you a dunce ;
There’s virtue, my hid, in the proof of the puddin’—
A pair of fine babies at once.
No snapping or snarling, henceforth, at your darling,
No mention of suits in divorce,
For Belle is the mother of “ Dun.” and his brother,
And you are the father, of course.
’Twas well that reviling produced reconciling,
A mutual forgiveness of sins :
For if, just consider, she’d stayed a grass widder
You wouldn’t be nursing the twins.
AT THE “J.C.” (WEST QUEENSLAND
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
None ever knew his name,
Honoured, or one of shame,
Highborn, or lowly ;
Only, upon that tree
Two letters, J and C,
Carved by him, mark where he
Lay dying slowly.
Why came he to the West?
Had then the parent nest
Grown so distasteful ?
What cause had he to shun
Life, ere ’twas well begun ?
Was he that youngest son
Of substance wasteful ?
Were fate and he at war?
Was it a penance, or
Renunciation ?
Is it a glad release ?
Has he at length found peace
Now Death had bid him cease
Peregrination?
Hands white, without a blot,
Told us that he was not
One of “ the vulgar.”
What can those cypheis be?
Two only, J and 0,
Carved in his agony,
Deep in the “Mulga ?”
Was there no woman’s face
Whose sunny smile might chase
Clouds from above him ?
No bosom white as snow ?
No lips to whisper low,
“ Why doth he seek to go?
Do 1 not love him ? ”
Haunted by flashing charms,
White bosoms, rounded arms,
Lips of fair ladies,
Striving to break some link,
’Twas that which made him sink,
Dragged by the curse of drink
Deeper than Hades?
Now, wind across the grave
Tuning a sultry stave,
Drearily whistles,
Stirring those branches, where
Two silent cyphers stare,
Two letters of a prayer,
God’s Son’s initials.

An elderly, much -married Melbourne
gentleman —one of those unctuous heavy fathers
who like to find some nice-looking girl and be a
parent to her—has come to grief badly. He came
across a lovely girl in a theatre who looked as if
she wanted some protecting arm to temper the wind
to the shorn maiden in short skirts, and he offered
to find her a home, - with the society of a moral
elderly person thrown in. She accepted the home
and he furnished it magnificently, but when he
came round the very first evening after his angei
took possession a quiet-looking man opened the
door and asked him, as a favour, not to call again.
His wife, he said blandly, was tired after her
work at the theatre, and moreover they lived a
very retired life and seldom cared to see strangers
—here the old stout man leaned against the door-
post and breathed stertorously. Moreover, the
children took up all her spare time—the fat pro-
tector sat down on the doorstep at this point and
asked himself if this was all a horrid dream. Then
the door closed softly, and the ancient and moral
gentleman got up and crawled away with an
awful conviction that he had been beguiled into
supplying a house and furniture to a plain, hard-
working family with 11 children, and that for all
the romance there was in the affair he might as
well have gone and embraced an elderly gamp
who washed floors for a livelihood. And the
moral is that youth and loveliness and romance
don’t always go together, and that an innocent
and affectionate soul is more often hidden behind
a watery green eye and an old, squashed, brown
bonnet than behind a halo of curls of gold.

It has just been decided in England that
no man is compelled to stay in a church against
his will, and that he must not be detained there
by violence. A man went into a cathedral the
other day in that blessed land of the free, and sat
patiently there till the sermon came on. Then
the preacher gave out his text, and droned away
till the sufferer could stand it no longer and started
for the door. But he was arrested on the way by
the beadle or somebody, and informed that he
couldn’t quit the sacred edifice unless he was ill.
The beadle was the bigger man of the two, and he
had to stay in the sacred edifice. But when he
got out he took action for assault and battery,
libel, illegal detention in a Cathedral, and demur-
rage, and the court decided that it is the privilege
of every free-born Englishman to quit a cathedral
when he wants to.

The present period of big failures and
small assets is suitable for telling the old yarn
about one Throgmorton, a Melbourne importer
who came a fearful cropper in days of yore. The
creditors of Throgmorton met at his request to
consider what had better be done with his estate,
set down on the schedule at a matter of £9
sterling. They rolled up in a compact body,
armed with invoices, promissory-notes, and bills
payable to the amount of a few thousands in all,
and called upon insolvent to make a proposal.
He shrugged his shoulders and replied that he
was entirely in the hands of his kind friends in
front—how did they propose to deal with the
assets? Then the creditors turned a sad, re-
proachful gaze upon the last speaker (who had
been more or less of a “pal” with the whole
crowd) and suggested that there were no assets to
dispose of. Whereupon Mr. T. produced nine
sovereigns from his pocket and moved that the
golden remnants of his estate be spent in cham-
pagne, debtor and creditors to share and share
alike. The champagne was fetched in and the
meeting sang “He's a jolly good fellow . as
Throgmorton apparently was. He dug them in
their respective lots of ribs to such an extent that
they undertook to give him a fresh start on
“ tick,” after which this quaint insolvent went on
and prospered until he was able to wipe off the
old score with interest added. We get none or
such fine, dashing, handsome, romantic failures
nowadays. The modern bankrupt lies like a
tombstone to his creditors, and the blaspheming
creditors, knowing themselves to be shamefully
robbed, seek the aid of a trustee, who gets back
what he can from the first robber and generally
sticks to it himself.

A STRIKE STORY.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
“ Flash ” Harry stood and scratched his ear,
They called him so, their reason
I’ll demonstrate and make as clear
As ’tis that Christmas comes each year,
When eggs are out of season.
In three weeks’ time he was to wed
A back-block belle named Mary,
W r ith her the path of life to tread—
A pleasant prospect, yet it shed
No light on his quandary.
Imagine now, how you would like
Stern fate to torture you so,
The tailor-men went out on strike,
Got the accentuated spike,
And wouldn’t make his trousseau.
“ I’d make a tailor’s head feel sore
If I could only cop one ;
An outfit ready made, oh, lor 1
The like I never heard before,
To have to get a slop one !
The only thing that I can do,
Though doing that with loathing,
Will be to send my measure to
That Sydney firm (we’ll call it Q)
Who make this ‘Austral’ clothing.”
He got a friend to run the show,
Who once had been a draper,
Who measured him from top to toe,
And round the body, high and low,
And put it down on paper.
He got a cheque for pounds and pence,
All duly signed and dated,
And had it crossed, to show his sense,
And then, for fresh developments
He sat him down and waited.
The long weeks vanished like a shot,
The fatal day drew nigher,
My hero’s speech grew strong and hot,
Because, you see, he hadn’t got.
His marrying attire.
’Twas not until the fatal morn
That he received the shipment,
A parcel (with its wrapper torn)
Of clothes, his figure to adorn,
His hymen’al equipment.
He quickly closed his chamber-door,
And donned them, with elation,
But Heavens ! how my hero swore,
Fit to unhinge his lower jaw,
With grief and horror, when he saw,
That slop-shop perpetration.
When in the glass his image caught,
His words both sharp and terse were.
Not fit for use in open courts
Because the coat was far too short,
The trousers the reverse were.
And where they should have clung most tight
Their slackness was tremendous,
In fact, he was a woeful sight,
From falling into such a plight
May heaven now defend us.
Yet he took comfort, and said he,
“This grievous visitation
Though bad enough, might yet worse be,
Perchance its incongruity
Is all imagination.”
Stifling his fears by force of will,
The subject of this lyric
Sped to the church to seek his “ Jin,’’
Who, with vituperation shrill
Opened flood-gates hysteric.
“Marry him in such awful clothes,
Just Heaven ! what effront’ry !”
And while the tears bedecked her nose
She voiced the burden of her woes,
Across the western country.
And so a compromise was made,
They tuned the harp and psalter
(I mean the loud harmonium played! !
“ Flash ” Harry led the blushing maid
All smiling to the altar.
Believe me ’twas a touching sight,
And one to make your pulse stir,
For, though the sun shone hot and bright,
My hero faced the wedding-rite,
Attirfed in an ulster.
SURCINGLE.
On Guard.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
Paddy Boyle was licensed to sell fermented
and spirituous liquors at the Mulga Hotel, on the
Dromedary Road, Sandfly district, Bananaland.
As a matter of fact, he sold rum—and rum only.
Paddy Boyle hadn’t too much custom, but he
made the most of what chances he did get. The
horses of travellers —more especially of moneyed
travellers —seemed to have a rooted objection to
the grass that grew in the immediate vicinity of
the ridge on the summit of which sweltered the
Mulga Hotel, with its perennial rum-cask, for
they were continually straying away and getting
lost, and had invariably to be trailed down by
Paddy’s black-boy, who as invariably used to
discover them just about the time when there was
no more corn in Egypt, and no more “ile ” in the
cruse, for their owner or owners. In fact, the
black-boy never found a man’s horse while that
man had any money left.
* * *
Sundown was just crisping the overdone
edges of a fierce summer’s day, when a four-horse
team toiled up the hill, driven by a hard-looking
man and followed by a harder-looking dog—both
with their tongues out. Unhitching his team,
and hobbling them out, the man made inside with
speed, and said —“Give us a bottle of beer, boss;
Pm as dry as a roasted snake.”
Paddy emptied out five-fingers of rum, with the
remark : “ That’s betther nor beer ; that’s the raal
Maokay. ”
The teamster swallowed it down, sizzlingly, and
smiled approval.
“ ’Nother,” said he, laconically.
Paddy responded with good-fellowship. The
smile on the teamster’s face merged into an
expression of imbecile vacancy—which is, to be
accurate, a want of expression. He curled down
on the verandah floor, and was presently dead to
the world.
Paddy immediately prospected the prostrate
form. It panned out well. Placing the pocket-
book and bundle back in the teamster’s pouch,
Paddy solemnly winked at the rum-bottle that
was still on the rough bar-counter, and said aloud:
“Shure, there do be no good feed round about
here for thim poor bastes; Oi’ll take ’em down
into the scrub pocket beyant, where they can fill
their bellies in no time wid big mouthfuls of swate
grane grass. ”
Off started Paddy on his merciful errand. As
he stooped to take the hobbles off the first horse a
live catapult hurled itself upon his back, threw
him down violently, swallowed about half of his
shirt, and then lay down beside him on most
malignant guard.
It was the teamster’s dog.
That ill-favoured animal was chums with the
horses and had acquired the habit of tending them
every night.
Paddy made a few attempts to coax the canine,
but failed utterly. No sooner did he move a
limb, too, than his gaoler rumbled forth a heart-
chilling growl, and once or twice made a spring of
menace. Paddy had perforce to lie still, while
mosquitoes and sandflies ate him up and a city of
ants held a racing carnival on his anatomy. So
passed a long and agonising night.
# # #
Early in the night, the teamster awoke on
the verandah, and crawled indoors for a corpse-
reviver. Mrs. Boyle was on duty, not knowing,
and apparently not caring, where Paddy was.
The visitor seemed a trifle shy of the same old
bottle at first, but, as Mrs. B. helped herself out
of it, he took courage and swigged it down man-
fully.
Then he had another. Mrs, B. had another.
The black-boy came in and was treated to “a
snifter.”
After which the teamster and Mrs. B. had 38
consecutive drinks.
At this stage, the black-boy commenced to help
himself and ask no questions.
After that —vermilion chaos in full undress.
# # *
The teamster and the black-boy chopped
away the verandah-posts, and the roof came down
with a run. Upon which, the teamster threw the
black-boy through the window and completely
wrecked the front of the shanty. Whereupon,
Mrs. B. began to bombard the teamster with pro-
miscuous bottles, and smashed the only other
window, and knocked sieve-holes into everything
but the man she aimed at. Then she jumped on
the counter and yelled, “Eire!” and wept aloud for
her native country, which was Ireland. The team-
ster, about this time, began to remember his old
digging-days, and, under the notion thatthe ground
beneath the Mulga Hotel was worth prospecting,
he started preliminary work by tearing up the
verandah flooring, and starting a fire underneath
his dray. Summoning the nigger to aid, he
carried out all the moveable furniture and piled
that also on the fire, while Mrs. B. danced jigs in
the most joyous style, she herself doing her own
lilting, and calling on the absent Paddy to come
and be murthered at wanst. At last the teamster
climbed on to the top of a 400-gallon ship’s tank,
and fell asleep with his long legs dangling over the
sides and attracting the up-curling flames. Mrs.
Boyle went off and bailed herself up in the cow-
bail, under the impression that it was milking-
time. She shortly fell prone and asleep. The
black-boy had sense enough to collar the last half-
keg of rum and roll it down-hill to his own camp,
where fragments of it were found next day. This
was after it had caught fire and exploded.
* • #
Towards morning, the hawker, turning in
his sleep, rolled off the tank, and came to grass
with a thud that scared ten years’ growth out of
him. As he gazed upon the wreck around him,
and heard the also-awakened Mrs. Boyle yelling
for somebody to come and unbail her, he realised
that it was time to go and look for his horses.
He found them.
He also found Paddy, who had been a helpless,
prisoner-witness of the night’s pandemonium.
“Call off this (incarnadine) devil of a dahg !”
said Paddy, furiously, “ an’ Oi’ll smash ivery
bone in yer ugly carcase to smithereens.”
The teamster was fightable, and the pair
clinched, while the dog acted as umpire to see
fair-play—for his master. Memory loses the rest
in a confused kaleidoscope of curses, mud, gore,
woman, scorched nigger, stampeding horses, man-
eating dog, utter exhaustion, discovery of grog
famine, and a( wild hunt after the flying remains
of the half-grilled black-boy.

Editor of Nahbethong (Vic.) Gazette :
“ Would our friends kindly excuse any short-
comings at this festive season, inasmuch as we are
our own editor, sub, reporter, canvasser, composi-
tor, and reader.” Editor of Narbethong Inde-
pendent : “Very hard, after all that trouble,’ for
him to be the only reader.”
From Lippincott.s, wherein a description
of a tiffin among the Mongols is given ;—The
Chinese nobility retire regularly to a vomitoriurn
in order to make room for the next instalments of
the feast. The plates are piled full of food every
two minutes, and the courses vary from 50 to
200!
Whalley, the godly lawyer who has just
died at Blackburn, Eng., leaving behind him the
usual shortage, kept a staff of fourteen clerks in
his two establishments. Ho was supposed to be
rich, and prided himself on his reputation for
piety and benevolence. His charities are described
as numerous. Ho is spoken of as a great reader
of religious literature, which he ostentatiously
exhibited in his office. At his office, Whalley had
a room which he used periodically as an oratory,
and into which lie .daily retired for private prayer.
On the pages of a memorandum which was found
in one of his drawers are crosses at intervals,
with the words, in his own handwriting, “ Pray
fervently.” A client relates that he was shown
the oratory, and told by Whalley “that he had
passed many happy hours in that little room in
silent communion with his Maker ” —to whom lie
went leaving behind him bogus deeds instead of
mortgages on real property, and valueless LO.U.’s
in the place of marketable seouritus.

“A Rambling Rhymester” : You say in your
Own reckless fashion that—
This is an unjustifiable assertion. Mammon is generally
bald “Septimus Brown ” : Your tale about a skinned
woman is too steep. Even the office ghoul passed on it.
“A. Hass": We went right through your story
looking for the surprise, or the plot, or the climax, and
not one of them was there .. “Echo": David Syme
doesn’t rhyme to swine, and the same difficulty crops up
all through your “pome.” Westbrook” (Tas.):
Letter to hand, but can’t find the enclosure. Moreover,
this paper seldom takes back a tiling when it has once
said it. If you didn’t do what we said you did, then you
ought to have done it rather than make us out a liar.,
“ Sydney H. Rae ” : William Bridger was advertised for
in Lloyd’s Newspaper (London). We don't remember the
date. Let him write to Lloyd’s. ... “A. M.” (Balmain):
Declined, owing to the dire stupidity of the parson in the
last act. If he had buried the dead man in quicklime, or
set the cottage on fire and combusted him, or eaten him,
or otherwise obliterated him, it would have been all right.
“G.S.” (South Brisbane); Stories told in that dialect
only make us feel tired. We would have to go Tight
through it and straighten up the grammar, and life is too
short “The Whaler”: It is better to be born lucky
than rich, but your luck was out when you wrote that
story... “ F.G.F.” (Melbourne): Too much like another
story of another phrenologist which appeared in The
Bulletin a few years ago “8.E.”: There are several
bad incongruities in the story. The worst one is that of
supposing that thepantomimegirl carries hercostumehome
with her to her “ attic in the slums.” Nobody ever saw
a pantomime girl going home in full costume.. “ W.H.P” :
Regret to say that our interest in burlesque microbes is
very limited “E. Hoa”: Thanks. Will consider
“ Ignorance ’’: When short of copy we’ll print your
prophecy “Edward Morley”: You send no address,
and we don’t remember your MS “ Eighteen years an
Elector” : G. H. Reid, hitherto the N.S.W. Civil Service
pet and champion, can hardly, to quote your words, go
in for “applying the axe to the root of that monstrous
growth,” and how can he continue to keep the publicans’
support if he allies himself with the rump of the Parkes
party, the bulk of whom are “ venomous teetotallers?”....
“To the Pure” &c.: Humour misty.. ..“Pakeno”:
(Maoriland): Rather off-colored, isn’t it ? “ Barman”:
A mere beer-advt .. “G. 1.” (Paddington): A comp.’s
error, and the S.M. Herald comps, make few mistakes....
“P.N.” (Adelaide): Thanks; had seen the cutting
“ J.B.A.”(Pad.): Thanks ... “Marsden”: Haven’t seen
it; who is the publisher, and when did it come out?
“ M.M.”: The Malay, for instance, is an infinitely worse
colonist than the Chinaman, working for half wages on a
Chinese scale. They are numerous on some of the stations-
in N.W. Australia “W. W.” (Grafton): Thanks....
“ P. M‘M.” (Sydney): Poetry of that kind is too under-
mining to the constitution “Port Adelaide”: We
agree with you. Personally we are of opinion that every
citizen of a free country should have beer laid on to his
house,by means of a hydrant, so as to be available at all
hours of the day and night... “Arthur” (Wellington):
You say in your dismal hymn—
I wonder which will go to heaven
Should they choose between us two.
We reply promptly that it won’t be you anyhow. Not
after writing that screed... “8.C.” (Mt. Morgan); We,
publish your complete ode with pleasure—
December is the twelfth month,
January is the oneth.
If all poets were as brief as you are there wouldn’t be so
many editors in Gehenna.... “ The Breaker ”; Not up to
your customary level. All our poets seem to be
broken up this week. Krislimiss, we presume
“ A.C.”: If you only mean that a woman is fragile, don’t
say she is “frail.” “J. Hardup” : Thanks. Already
noticed “ A.L.0.” : Why? The Australian art-student
who is really successful in Europe never comes back. Why
should he? “ M.” (Arm.): (1) Sorry to say no opening.
(2) Verses unsuitable. . .“B. S. Percy”: Letter for you
at Bulletin office “C.C.”: Parkes expressly stated
that he was altogether opposed to the existence of any
Parliamentary Labour-party “New Norcia”: Why

WHAT EVERYBODY SHOULD KNOW.
Sprains are injuries done to the ligaments,
tendons, and other structures surrounding the
joints. They are produced by jumping, falling,
lifting heavy weights, or other causes, which
forcibly stretch or lacerate the tendons, &c. Ihe
joints most liable to sprains are the wrist ami
ankle joints. The latter are more frequently
sprained by persons in the act of jumping or
running, or by the foot turning under the weight
of the body, while the wrist may be sprained in a
fall, or by handling heavy objects, and so on.
Injuries of this kind are of the most common
occurrence, and everyone should know how to best
treat them. Sprains are attended with great
pain at the time of the accident, and also with
considerable swelling and discoloration of the
injured part; the swelling and discoloration arise
irom the effusion of blood into the surrounding
structures. In the treatment of sprains the
injured limb must be kept in a perfect state of
quietude, and in such a position as to relax the
muscles in connection with the affected tendons,
as well as to favor the return of the blood to the
heart. The bowels should be kept in a free state
and hot fomentations applied to the sprain by
means of a sponge or piece of thick flannel. Next,
dry gently with a soft Turkish towel, and im-
mediately after apply St. Jacobs Oil, which
should be rubbed, as the patient may be able to
i bear, over and around the part affected, with the
palm of the hand ; then bandage tightly with
; strips of old linen saturated in the same liniment,
and let the operation be repeated at intervals
; until a cure is effected. By this treatment the
disease will rapidly subside, and the affected part
will return to its usual healthy condition. r llns
was the experience of Mr. James Grant, of No. 2,
j Kent-street, Sydney, who writes: “I formerly
; worked on the Margaret-street wharf, and while
there the sinews of my forearm gave way, and I
, was unable to lift anything, and so prevented
I from following my employment. I was advised
; to try St. Jacobs Oil, and did so with good effect,
as my arms are now quite strong, and I can carry 7
heavy weights without feeling anything of my
former complaint.” Cut this out and paste it in
your scrap-book.

HOROLOGIOAL CURIOSITIES.
A BLIND MAN’S WATCH.
Her Majesty Queen Victoria has two beautiful
little gold watches, by Breguet, that are
supposed to be 100 years old. They have silver
dials and are about the size of a two shilling piece.
One is a blind man’s watch; the other is a
repeater. Both go perfectly, and are in constant
u«e The Queen’s favorite watch is a large plain
gold one by Mudge, the English maker. The
favorite watches with persons of lesser degree are
those known as the Waterburys. These ate
manufactured in a variety of styles, and are sold
at prices which, taking into consideration their
finish and excellency as timekeepers, must be re-
garded as nothing short of phenomenal, ihe
great success which has attended the sale of these
watches, and the almost unanimous verdict of the
public in their favor, conclusively prove the claims
made for the Waterburys. .
An important fact in connection with these
marvellous watches is their ease and cheapness of
repair. In the event of injury befalling one of
them, on taking or sending it to the Waterbury
Watch Co.’s Repair Depot, 56, Margaret-street,
Sydney, it will be efficiently repaired at a merely
nominal cost. Note this for reference.

At latest advices the interminable Osman
Digna was preparing to start once more that war
which never quite ends in the Soudan. This is
another nasty reflection on the Australian Con-
tingent. That famous circus went to the Soudan,
wandered about for two or three months with a
brass band and a flag, and then came home with
a stolen donkey and an annexed goat and called it
war. Lut it wasn’t war, for the one great essen-
tial in a campaign is that each side must be pre-
pared to see the affair through to the bitter end,
and the army that is liable to get tired and go
back to its mother is a failure. Osman is evi-
dently prepared to hang out in Africa for 40
yearn, and if persistence counts for anything he
will finish by leading his “dervishes” into London
and turning St. Paul’s into a mosque.
THE PHINCE OF WALES SPEAKS ON
HEALTH.
In his able and timely remarks at the opening
of the International Congress of Hygiene, at St.
James’s Hall, London, August 10th, 1891, the
President, the Prince of Wales, said :—“ The
highest possible prosperity is when rich and poor
a'xke can do such useful work as then are lit for ,
and to this end it is essential that they' should enjoy
the best possible health and vigor ,
Very true, but how can the public health bo
best promoted ‘I Clearly by such preventive
measures as the Congress meets to consider, and
by reliable remedies so long as certain diseases
continue to prevail.
We submit an example of the latter necessity in
the form of a statement which cannot fail to con-
vince the minds of all who may read it.
[copy.]
I, Margaret Morland, of Throstle Nest Farm,
Haya Park, near Knaresboro’, Yorkshire, do
solemnly and sincerely declare as follows :—
“I have suffered all my life from a weak
stomach, indigestion and liver complaint. 1 wag
never properly well but always ailing attd neVel
seemed to gain strength. I had a bad taste ih the
mouth and a strange sinking feeling at the pit of
my stomach. I had always pain after eating, no
matter how simple the food was. My appetite
was poor and what little I ate did not seem to
give me strength. I had great pain at the chest
and sides and felt as if I was held or bound round
my waist. 1 was much troubled with sickness
and very often found no ease until I vomited all
the food I had taken. I felt low, weak, and de-
pressed, as if something was hanging over me. 1
could not sleep at night, and got so bad that I
even dreaded going to bed, for I would lie awake
for hours together, and on rising in the morning I
felt more tired than when I went to bed. As
years went on I became a bad colour, my skin and
particularly the whites of toy eyes were tinged of
a yellowish colour, and at times 1 was as yellow
as a sovereign. In August, 1880, my stomach
became very irritable and everything that I took
turned sour on my stomach, and I was constantly
vomiting a foul bitter fluid or gas. I took little
or no nourishment, and after each morsel of even
liquid, food I strained and vomited as if my
poor inside would come out. The pain at
my heart now became so severe that I be-
came alarmed and sent for our doctor, who
attended me for ten or twelve weeks, but all the
medicine he gave me did no good. The doctor
seemed puzzled with my complaint and changed
the medicine over and over again, but still I got
worse instead of better. At last I lost all faith in
physic and gave up taking it. Now better, now
worse, I continued until July, 1888, when my
kidneys became affected. I had dreadful pain in
the back and could not void my water. My skin
was dry and hot, my lips parched and feverish.
After a time the water lodged so bad that I
thought I should have died. I grew weaker and
weaker every day, and felt that if a change did not
soon take place my condition would be critical, for
the pain was more than I could bear. I could not
even bide to lie in bed, and had to get out of bed and
walk about the room. I took all kinds ofmedi
nines, but nothing gave me more than temporary
relief, and I dragged on in this miserable stale
until December, 1888, when Mr. Day, the chemist,
at Knaresboro’, sent me a book telling of a medi-
cine called Mother Seigel’s Curative Syrup, and J
read of a case similar to mine having been cured
by this medicine. I determined to try it. and
sent to Mr. Day and procured a large buttle of the
Syrup and commenced taking it. 1 soon began to
find relief, my food digested better, and gave me
strength, all pains in my back and sides left me.
I could now sleep better and gradually gained
strength every day, and by the time I had taken
a 4s. 6d. bottle 1 was better than ever 1 was in my
life, and by taking an occasional dose I have since
kept in good health. 1 may mention that I paid
over six pounds to one doctor and did not receive
any benefit whatever. I feel very grateful for
the great benefit I have received from Seigel's
Syrup, and I wish others to know of it. I have
recommended the medicine to many people in tliis
district with great benefit. My daughter, Mrs.
Ware, living at York, was cured of severe dys-
pepsia after every other means had failed. If by
publishing this statement others may be benefited
I shall be very glad, and I hereby give permission
to the proprietors of Seigel’s Syrup to make any
use they may think fit of this testimonial, and I
make this solemn declaration conscientiously be-
lieving the same to be true. By virtue of the
Provisions of the Statutory Declaration Act, 1835
(William IV. c, 62).
Declared before me at Leeds,'
in the County of York, by
the said Margaret Morland,
on Monday, the 10th of -
August, 1891.
(Signed) Alf. Cooke,
Mayor of Leeds. ,

Margaret Morland.
Mr. William Mori and, the husband of this lady,
is a fanner, well-known and highly respected. He
lias lived on his present farm at Throstle Nest,
Haya Park, seventeen years, and in the district
all his life. He was present at Leeds when the
foregoing declaration by his wife was read, and
vouched for its accuracy and truth. Mrs. Mor-
land’s malady, indigestion and dyspepsia, is suf-
ficiently common and fatal to make it a duty to
give the widest publicity to any remedy that
will cure it. Hence our mention of the above
ease in connection with the work of the society of
which His Royal Highness is President.
Macgregor Land.
The long and elaborate reports Sir Wil-
I lam-Maegregor writes about British New Guinea
are all padding. It is absolute heresy to say this,
ut course just as it’s downright blasphemy to say
that Stanley’s “original ” African nigger-stories
are scissored out of Uncle Remus’ book. Macgregor
has, ime Buli.ktin is credibly informed, never
been 50 miles from the coast, except by water.
. 18 own reports are noticeably remarkable for his
fondness for getting into the interior per river
way. Now, any man with two good legs can
walk up Mount Owen Stanley by simply sending
a party ahead to cut a track. Certainly, Mac-
gregor is always on the move, and fussing about
to make the natives understand his laws, while he
autocratically shuts out white men from examin-
ing or opening up the country, under the plea of
philanthropy. For being on the move, Macgregor
gets A 2 a day as ex’s. ; and his philanthropy
ensures a lasting Government by Administration.
It is, however, useless for officialdom to attempt
to spoon back the tidal wave of progress, and
British New as a part of Australia, has
got to come out of the shell of Crown Administra-
tion and move up. Already German New Guinea is
being opened up rapidly, while British New
Guinea remains choked by officialdom. As it is
attached to Queensland, the Government of that
province has a right to exercise some direct con-
trol over the New Guinea territory. At present
the sum of <£16,000 per annum paid by the Aus-
tralian provinces to run New Guinea is absolutely
wasted. The place might fairly be called Mac-
gregor Land.
* * *
Macgregor’s judicature is nob a startling
success. Half of it is misunderstood by the
natives; the other half is ridiculed by them —when
they dare. Botany Bay in miniature would not
be a bad name for it. Already it has a chain-
gang working on the roads, and there have been
hangings. If a native steals the pig of another—
and is caught— to the chain-gang he goes. At the
first hanging festival, Macgregor naturally needed
gallows. It is related that he showed the
Government carpenter (!) a plan of the hanging
apparatus in vogue at Newgate, and wanted a
similar convenience erected at Port Moresby!
Ihe carpenter puzzled his brains over the plans,
and finally reported that such machinery would
be too elaborate and expensive for hanging an
odd black or two, and recommended that two
upright poles and a cross-beam might be an im-
provement upon Newgate advanced thought.
Unit suggestion, fortunately for Macgregor’s
reputation for sanity, was adopted.
• * *
Officialdom is a happy family at Port
Moresby, but it swaggers much, with, per-
haps, the exception of Colonial Secretary
Musgrave, who seems intelligent and capable,
and who is obliging. Whether the others are
intelligent or not, the writer was unable to learn.
One of Macgregor’s beliefs is that he is an ex-
plorer, as his previous Pacific records painfully
o jtt'ude upon their reader, and Colonial Treasurer
aptam Hatton-Richards (as if he hadn’t been
sufficient]}''christened, “the boys” give him ever
so many other sobriquets of esteem) well,
Hatton-Richards has been unkind enough to say
that Macgregor was “an explorer second only
to Stanley ! At one native village, the natives
call their prize-boar, “ The Governor !” This, as
a compliment.
* * *
lo wander afield. A German steamer
was going up the St. Augusta River, German
N.G. , and landed a crew at a village. A photo-
grapher was aboard and ho landed also, with a
view of “taking” a group of natives. After
immense trouble and many failures, he got the
ll, &f>ers to stand still, and, proceeding to the
camera, put his head under the cloth—whizz' a
shower of spears! Again he gift the duskies
quiet, and again—spears! He gave it best.
WAPAP.
Says a London paper: “It is enough to
make a thrifty Chancellor of the Exchequer
groan to think of big ships kept months waiting:
for guns which cost <£13,000 each, and are only
good for 80 or 90 rounds, and which, after all,
have (as in the case of the Howe) to be changed
three times within a year.
A bun day paper : “We do not believe in
the sincerity of the Labour M. P. who wears silk
socks and uses scent.” Right. But doesn’t that
paper in the same issue eulogise the lowly onion
and didn’t it say, a few days ago, that it was
dangerous to take a bath more than once a week ?


The universal popularity of Ayer’s Hair Vigor

Dressing for the Hair.
When the hair becomes thin, faded, or pre-
maturely gray, this preparation restores all its
former color, fullness, and texture. Bland, cool,
and delightfully perfumed, Ayer’s Hair Vigor
prevents baldness, keeps the head free from
dandruff, and cures unsightly and troublesome
humors of the scalp. Ladies desirous of having

Why Suffer One Moment
From Torturing Skin Diseases
When a single application of the Cuticura Remedies will, in
the great majority of cases, instantly relieve the most agonizing of
itching, burning, scaly, crusted, pimply, and blotchy skin and scalp
diseases, and point to a permanent and economical (because so
speedy) cure, when the best physicians and all other remedies fail ?
Cuticura Remedies are the
greatest skin cures, blood purifiers,
and humor remedies, are absolutely
pure, and may be used by the
youngest and most delicate with
gratifying and unfailing success.
CUTICURA
the great skin cure, instantly
allays the most intense itching,
burning and inflammation, permits
rest and sleep, speedily heals the CUTICURA TYPES OF HEALTH AND BEAUTY,

of hair, from infancy to age, from pimples to scrofula.
All about the Blood, Skin, Scalp, and Hair,” 64 pages, 300 Diseases, 50 Illustra-
tions, and 100 Testimonials, is wrapped around every bottle of the Cuiicura Resolvent.

Head —‘ A Golden Shanty.’
Let Us be Careful.
Dear Bulletin, —Let us be careful. Let us
be very careful. The defenders of our peace
are abroad, and in the enthusiasm of then-
ideas of defending it, we may find our-
selves one of these salubrious mornings in
the lock-up. We have great respect, amounting
almost to awe, of the “Fooroe.” It contains a
fine body of men —as an undertaker would say.
Nevertheless, we are going—with fear and tremb-
ling—to take liberties with it.
In the first instance, we say that no carpenter,
bricklayer, mason, or ordinary tradesman could
afford to own a terrace of houses out of his legiti-
mate savings. Yet nearly every policeman who
retires can do this. The terrace of houses has
been a gibe against policemen for a long time.
There is more than sarcasm in it. The policeman is
only human —which seems almost blasphemy—
and no surer of the result of his speculations than
the ordinary human being. He must lose at times;
but he always comes out right with his little ter-
race to collect rents from at the end of his time.
Sir Robert Peel, who instituted him, must at the
same time have arranged with Providence a special
miracle 6n the policeman’s behalf to the purpose
that he should pretty nearly always end his days
in affluence.
It is a curious thing, by the way, that on look-
ing through the book which is kept in every
police-office the entries concerning the amount of
money found on “drunks” rarely exceed a
shilling or two, and a pipe. Sometimes they run
to three-and-sixpenoe and a pocket-knife, but that
may be in the case of a town councillor.
“Close the pubs.,” said a retired policeman
to us one day when, in a moment of sar-
donic humour, we made a suggestion that
doing so would be a good thing, “ Close the pubs. !
Then if you do,” he said, bringing his fist down
on his own bar-counter with a crash that made all
the glasses rattle —“My boy will never jine the
foorce.” Of course not. No drunken men—no
terraces.
We begin to be afraid that in the preceding
remarks we have not been as careful as we had in-
tended to be. We are not terribly troubled, for
all that, when we come to think of it, There was
an old Roman question concerning the Praetorian
Guards “ Quis custodiet custodes !” which
applies considerably to our defenders of the peace.
The majority of them are young Irishmen aching
for a row. The Irish are supposed to be the
monopolists of bulls, but surely John Bull deserves
his title when he made Irishmen his “defenders
of the peace.” Donnybrook Fair is the ideal of
most of them as a harmless and healthy recrea-
tion. “Fwhy,” said a constable to us one
right on Princes Bridge, Melbourne, “ if it wasn’t
for the fightin’ and skylarkin’ I’d lave the fooroe
to-morrow.”
We have put these things somewhat too flip-
pantly perhaps, but they lead to one effect. An
irascible young constable, in the full-blown glory
of being able to order people to “move on,” and
such like, comes across an inoffensive citizen
(probably standing at the corner waiting for a
friend) who objects to being “ moved on ” in such
an ignominious way. An altercation ensues and
the inoffensive citizen is hauled to the lock-up.
We have an instance in our memory of this same
thing being done in the city of Melbourne to a
magistrate. Of course the constable was a new
constable, and. of course, he apologised and, of
course, he was severely reprimanded. ‘ But all
people are not magistrates.
There is a thing we wish to put plainly before
those who are supposed to make laws. A vulgar
and illiterate constable in course of time becomes
a vulgar, illiterate, and ignorantly arrogant ser-
geant. This man, in the way of routine, learns
the procedure of police-courts. Justices of the
Peace are appointed, not on account of then-
knowledge, intellect, or known wisdom, but
merely on account of their position. Mr. Brown
is an eminent brick-contractor. Mr. Smith is an
equally eminent shoe-vendor. An intelligent
Government sees at once that they have all the
qualifications necessary for Justices of the
Peace. Ask one of them about the Laws of
Justinian—he will probably want to commit you
for contempt of Court. Ask him about anything
connected with our own chaotic code of law, and
he will—well he will know nothing and know
it insolently. The natural result is that the
ignorant and arrogant sergeant who has learnt the
procedure—not the real spirit and theory of the
law, remember, and let us further say not being
capable of understanding it—has this ignorant and
almost equally arrogant Bench at his fingers’ ends,
as the phrase runs. “Do ye plade guilty?” said
an eminent bricklaying J. P., in Carlton, once to
a prisoner who was accused of making a row of
some sort. “No, your Worship,” replied the pri-
soner. “But ye are,” said the magistrate. “No,”
answered the prisoner firmly. “Take him
away,” howled the dispenser of justice, “seven
days’for contempt of court.” And in an under
tone to his fellows on the bench—he was chair-
man—“l’m d dif I’m go’in to let a fellow
like that call me a liar. ”
The following incident is calculated to charm
those who believe in the Spartan integrity of the
police. Not long ago a man—a respectable and
sober man—was locked up, dragged to gaol,
because—a policeman had struck him! These are
the simple facts : He was standing quietly at the
side of the street when a policeman came up and
called him most of the names in the slang dic-
tionary, and then struck him. The man, even
then, mildly expostulated—and was handcuffed.
In the cell he was assaulted by the same policeman !
These facts came out in Court, but what said
the Magistrate ? * ‘ The police must be protected
even when they exceed their duty ; 40s. or seven
days !” Of course they must be protected. Poor
things ! If they were not protected where would
their terraces be ? But this is a frivolous question.
—A Spalpeen.
r“A Spalpeen” probably does the force a grave in*
justice, but it is just as well he should be permitted to
have his little jibe. His attempted ventilation of this
long-discussed question gives us an opportunity of re-
marking that policemen usually accumulate money
because the discipline to which they are subjected makes
them steady and sober, because they enjoy fair pay and
get it regularly, and because they have plenty of time to
scheme. We shall be glad to receive any new theories on
this debateable question.—Ed. B.]

SPORTING NOTIONS.
But for Sharpe getting his “hand in ” shortly
after 3 p.m on Jan. 1, the Australians might have knocked
up a long, slow score against the Sheffield Lambs in their
first innings. Attewell, the Britishers’ main hope on a
dry wicket, didn’t look dangerous at any time, ditto Leh-
mann and Briggs. Peel, too, was losing all his terrors for
them when Sharpe was put on for the second or third try
and began to be as deadly as the “demon ” at his best.
The halls that howled Bruce and Donnan were, humanly
speaking, unplayable. Satan might have cut them lo the
boundary, and pulled ’em cleverly to square leg, but a
weak mortal seldom gets his bat on such scorchers, and
when he does contrive to touch them as they fly upward
to his hails there are five men in the slips waiting for a
catch. Lohmann’s fielding to the bowling of Sharpe is a
treat to witness when the latter is having his day out.
Against the weak Victorian team Sharpe had seemed an
expensive failure, but on New Year’s Day very few of his
thunderbolts went through the field. It is in taking and
returning the fast ones that M‘Gregor shines.

usual. For the Standish Handicap the “ dead bird” was
stopped by a had start, and in the Bagot Stakes race l;c

judicious orders, no doubt) until nobody marvelled at
the horse’s inability to go in and win when the jockev

isn’t open to run, walk, jump, row, swim, and box any

two inches further than a man who hasn’t devoted his life

a few particular styles of his own invention. Champions

London Referee says that having seen Sullivan

feet, good in the wind, clever, and undeniably vicious.

The committee of N.S.W. National Regatta
firmly refuse to allow coloured sails, on the ground that
such sails would lead to gambling amongst that large
section of the public who now know nothing about boats

intelligible to them, to bet on it just as they would bet on
a horse, or a jumping-frog, or a box of dice.

It is claimed by the coloured-sail people that, in

men need do is go right ahead and wipe the others out,
as the fittest will survive. Apropos, The Bulletin would
suggest that theowners of the boats with gaudy sails should
occasionally wash the ostensibly white area of their sails.

“ Nothing was found on the deceased save a
race-card and a ham-sandwich,” says an English paper,
concerning a man who fell down dead on a racecourse.
A race had just finished when he shuffled off, and as there
was a pencil-mark on the dead man's eard against the'
horse that ran fourth,, it was presumed that he had
hacked that animal for everything he had in the world,
barring the ham-sandwich, and then died of frenzy.

There were some athletic sports recently in
a N.S.W. backblocks settlement, and owing to a number
of scratchings the big foot-race came on with only three
competitors. One of these was the favourite and great
gun of the district, and the other two were common out-
siders—as common as they could be. The prize was £lO
and the unseeing multitude regarded it as a dead cer-
tainty for the favourite. That individual himself regarded
the matter in a totally different light, as he had just been
seized with a violent stomach-ache and couldn’t run a
yard, but he didn’t publish his ailment. Instead, he took
one of the Competitors aside, and pointed out that the
race lay practically between the two of them, the third
man being no good, therefore, the best thing was to
strike an agreement that, whichever won, they should
divide the stakes. Proposal accepted with acclamation.
Then he took the other competitor aside, and pointed'out
that the race practically lay between them, because the
second man was no good, and therefore they had better
divide the stakes in the same manner. This proposition
was also agreed to with internal cheers. By the time the
race started (he favourite’s stomach-ache was so bad that
he could hardly stand, so he only ran about six yards and
then fell. And as he lay in the grass in his misery he
consoled himself with the knowledge that the other two
men were running themselves to death under a blazing
sun for his special benefit, and that no matter how it
ended, he had made a dead certainty of one-half the
money. It was a good and noble device, and some day a
man with a dead horse will win half the Melbourne Cup
prize by just such a scheme.

and his three and four-year-olds have come well to the
fore at the Tasmanian Spring Meeting. We would like to
see some of his stock allowed to mature well before being
raced at all. Many of the best English breeders are now

A Plot for a Play.
(Special Bulletin Translation.)
In the smoking-room after dinner, the Hebrew
theatre-manager, Pereira, stood before the fire,
holding in his hand a little glass of curajoa, like an
enormous ruby.
“ The story,” he said, “the whole thing lies in
that. A piece is no good unless you can tell the
story in five minutes. When an author comes to
me at breakfast-time to talk about his comedy, I
stop him at once—‘ Will you be through by the
time I finish this egg? ’ If he can tdo it, there is
nothing in the play.” And Pereira gulped down
his ourajoa. ,
“I’m not a dramatic author,” said Maurice, the
attache, from the depths of the arm-chair in
which he was buried, “ but if you like, Pereira,
I’ll tell you an anecdote out of which I think a
man in that line might make something. But it
takes a very short time to eat an egg, you know.”
“Well, say an omelette,” laughed the Jew.
“ But the ideas of society gentlemen about plots—
I don’t expect much from them. However, go
a h ea( J
“ It is a story that went the round of the salons
when I was in Vienna. There was a doctor there
then with a great reputation for heart-disease; his
name was—say, Arnold. Though hardly 40, he
had a splendid practice. He was a fine, distin-
guished-looking man with regular features, big,
blond Austrian whiskers, and a pair of eyes after
the American style—blue, and cold as steel. A
Russian family staying in the city—let us call
them the Skebeloffs —called the doctor in to
attend to the daughter of the house ; and the
specialist discovered on the first examination the
commencement of an aneurism. It must have
been very embarrassing to sound Miss Macha.
Just think of it, applying his ear to the breast of
a charming blonde of 19, and tapping above her
heart as though to say —may I come in?”
“Now, Maurice,” interrupted the host, no
low-comedy jokes. You promised us a drama.
“You shall have it, make your mind easy.
Finally the doctor fell head over ears in love,
asked for Miss Macha’s hand, was allowed to pay
his addresses, and at the end of three months
married her. The young wife was a great success
in Viennese society. They were an interesting
couple. The doctor loved Macha both as wife
and as patient; he adored her and lavished on her
all his skill. The little romance delighted the
sentimental Teutons. Madame Arnold, whose
health was visibly being re-established, began to
make frequent appearances in society, even danced
occasionally .”
“ In spite, of her heart-disease :
“ Yes; the young woman seemed so far re-
covered that Arnold, as her doctor, allowed her a
waltz, though I think he would have liked, as a
jealous husband, to forbid it. Captain de Blaze-
witz, an Apollo in a white uniform, was always
the first to have his name down on Madame
Arnold’s ball programme, and pressed her ten-
derly to the gold lace on his breast. The old
story of Mars and Venus .”
“Go on, Maurice. Your actors are on the
stage ; let them get to business.”
“ Very well! One day the doctor discovered a
packet of letters .”
“Too stale, the packet of letters!”
“ Pereira, you’re a nuisance ! You can make it
what you like; in my story they are letters.’
“That give the husband proof of his dishonour,
do they not?”
“So it seems.”
“ And put into his mind a project of venge-
ance ?”
• If you know the story, tell it yourself ?”
“ No, my boy, I’m only clearing the ground.
Well, the husband took his revenge ”
“ By one of those crimes that remain for ever
hidden.”
“ Then how did it become known ?”
“ Because the doctor told it. Yes, the culprit
himself, later on, yielding to that irresistible,
fatal impulse to impart his secret, that exists in
all men, and that renders the Catholic confes-
sional one of the must— —”
“Oh ! We know all that !”
“ I won’t say another word,” growled the young
man, sulkily. _ ...
“ Don’t lose your temper,” replied Pereira, with
good-humoured insolence, “we are just saving
you the trouble of finishing your sentences, ihat
is the true theatre style. The husband, then ’
“Resolved on a terrible vengeance, only pos-
sible for a man in his profession. Macha was not
completely cured, as he—the specialist well
knew, of the malady which he had treated for two
years with so much care and tenderness. He set
to work to bring it back again. Restraining his
anger, he carefully adopted towards his wife the
attitude of a restless, suspicious husband, and so
threw her into a state of fear and inquietude.
He knew, by the letters he had discovered, what
an ungovernable passion had taken possession of
the two lovers, and he was certain that, even in
the midst of dangers, they_ would always seek
some way of meeting. Of this he took advantage.
Thenceforth, some mysterious power threw all
sorts of little obstacles between Macha and de
Blazewitz. Without separating them altogether,
it made them miss their appointments, interrupted
their correspondence, disturbed and poisoned
their loves ; and under this life of agitation and
wearing emotion, Madame Arnold’s health
gave way again in an alarming manner.
The doctor was killing his _ wife with the
same certitude and precision with which he had
previously cured her. The hour of wild fear
that gives a feverish activity to the circulation
would, by his consummate skill, be followed up by
long days of sadness, congesting the heart and
holding back the blood; then he would suddenly
appear to throw off his jealousy, and be touched
to tears by the sufferings of his wife ‘ But what
can be the matter, my poor darling ?’ he would
say. ‘My diagnosis is all at fault. You have all
the appearances of a person dying of grief; are
you not happy with me ?’ And so, while gloating
with a diabolical joy over the progress of the
disease, he crucified his victim with his hypo-
critical despair. At the end of six months the
syncopes became more frequent, the palpitations
more rapid; the most alarming symptoms of
aneurism had re-appeared. . . Come, Pereira,
you don’t interrupt me now !”
“ Ah, well, that’s the second act—the point of
the plot. But the denouement, the denouement!”
11.
“ Denouement, sir ? Coming!” cried Maurice,
with the tone of a waiter in a restaurant.
“One night, the doctor burst into his wife’s
room like a tempest: ‘Madame,’he shouted, ‘I
know all. M. de Blazewitz is your lover !’
“Poor Macha grew pale as a sheet, and the
blue shade of death came to her lips.
“ * Kill me !’ she said. It was precisely what
Arnold meant to do.
“‘ I shall not lift a hand against a woman, he
replied. ‘Your accomplice has paid for two. I
have just fought M. de Blazewitz and killed
him!’
“ Maoha dropped lifeless to the floor.
“The doctor had lied. He would not have
dared to touch a hair of the captain, who was
reputed to be the best shot in Vienna.
“Ho knelt beside his wife and took her hand.
The pulse was still beating. He applied remedies
and revived her.
“ ‘Now go and put on a ball-dress, and all your
diamonds,’ he ordered. ‘ You will accompany me
to the French embassy. We have an invitation.’
“ ‘ Never ! I could never do it ! ’
“ ‘You must do it. I made a quarrel at cards
the pretext of my duel with de Blazewitz, but you
are compromised. You must be seen to-night on
my arm ; or it will be believed that I fought about
you, and I shall be dishonoured. Go and dress, I
insist on it.’
“The unhappy woman could only obey. How
was she to resist the man she had so deeply
wronged? She completed her toilet —with what
agony ! —and her husband dragged her to the ball
at the embassy. There, half-dead, she sank down,
rather than sat, in the entrance-hall, where the
footman every minute called the names of the
guests as they arrived. . ,
“ The doctor, in full dress, splendid with all his
decorations, stood behind his wife’s chair.
“Suddenly, after a quick glance in the ante-
chamber, he stooped to Macha’s ear, as if to
whisper a compliment.
“ ‘Your grief did not kill you, then ? ’
“ ‘Not yet, unhappily !’ murmured the tortured
“‘Well, look there,’ he said, pointing to the
door, ‘ and die of joy ! ’
“At that moment the footman, in a sonorous
voice, announced :
“ ‘ Captain Baron de Blazewitz ! ’
“ The handsome officer entered, a smile on his
lips, and his eyes, as usual, sought at once for his
mistress. He barely recognised her.
“ Macha had just started from her seat, as
though moved by a spring. She was livid under
her jewellery. She gave him a wild stare,_ then
lifted her hand to her throat, and fell heavily to
the ground, dead, really dead this time.
“Therewas a terrible uproar. The doctor threw
himself with heartrending cries on his wife’s body,
and the despair of De Blazewitz would have
caused a scandal if a friend had not dragged him
away.
“ The guests all hurried off, the waiters ate the
supper, and the ambassadress was much annoyed,
because she had had some grotesque masks made
expressly for the cotillion, which she had ex-
pected to be a great success.”
111.
When Maurice had finished there was a moment’s
silence. A sort of shiver went round, and even
Pereira did himself injustice by not delivering any
stupid remarks. Just then the hostess lifted the
portiere of the smoking-room.
“Well, gentlemen, have you finished your
cigars ? The ladies are waiting for you. ”
On the way to the salon Pereira took Maurice
by the arm.
“ And what became of the doctor ?”
“ As I said, he almost boasted, in an imprudent
moment, of his crime, which, however, has escaped
all punishment. But he was not able to stay in
Vienna. He is now at Warsaw, where he has a
very large practice, and continues to repeat to
those suffering from his speciality : ‘ Above all,
no emotion, no emotion !’ But what do you think
of my story as a subject for a play ?”
“Impossible, my dear fellow. All the paper?
would say it was copied from Octavo Feuillet'a
‘Julie.’”
FRANCOIS COPPEE.
William Rolleston, member for Christ-
church (M.L.), is an individual who never knows
when to stop talking. There was a political
banquet the other day, in that town of howling
desolation called Balclutha, and one politician
after another jawed in solemn cadences till mid-
night. Then when the guests were partially
drunk, and in the last stage of weariness, Rolle-
ston got up, and from twelve till two he snuffled
along in a grievous voice about the policy of the
Government, and the Bill for the recovery of lost
tailings, and the scheme for compensating miner's
whose crushing-plant had been struck by light-
ning. Most of the guests fell asleep and bobbed
their heads dejectedly up and down; the bass
iron bells of Balclutha struck two with a hollow
boom ; and Vincent Pyke, who wasn’t asleep,
snored with a hideous “ wuff ” and a
“gvvook” and a sound like “howpff,” in th«
hope that Rolleston would take the hint; but he
didn’t. Then Pyke tossed up with his next neigh-
bour which would fall with a crash on the floor
and thus make a diversion, and the next man
lost, and Pyke kicked his chair from under him,
so that he came down with a roar. He hit his
head against something, and got up howling.
“ You old ruffian!” he said briefly to Pyke,
“what did you do that for?” “ Time to go to
bed, old man,” responded Pyke blandly ; “ I feel
that way myself.” “ You feel,” said the victim,
holding his damaged head; “I’ll make you feel,
you miserable old sinner, you— —” Their friends
woke up at this stage and wrenched the com-
batants apart, but Rolleston had lost the thread
of his discourse, and as he couldn’t recover it, the
meeting broke up and stumbled through the
deserted streets on its way home.
Some curious objects have been unloaded
on to the N.S. Wales bench at various times, and
some peculiar decisions have resulted in conse-
quence thereof. Here is a case in point. The
prisoner was being tried for escaping from gaol.
The Crown proved that he had climbed over the
wall, and kept ahead of his pursuers for three
days, and was then captured 60 miles from the
gaol. Then the Judge chipped in and directed an
acquittal. “For,” he said, “the Crown has
proved that the prisoner, after getting out, was,
after three days, captured and brought back.
Therefore, he did not escape for there he is in the
dock.” Wherefore, it follows from this dictum that
no man who is captured can be indicted for this
offence; and if he is not captured he can’t be
indicted. So that on this decision—which dees
not seem to have been followed in later cases—
the crime of escape seems to be about the safest
one in the whole code. If the prisoner is
caught he can’t be convicted, and if he is not
caught he can’t be punished. The Judge who
gave that luminous decision was probably first
cousin to the Kempsey jury which found a
prisoner “ not guilty ” with “ a recommendation
to mercy on account of his excellent character
and more than likely was twin brother to the
Bathurst jury which returned a verdict of
“ guilty ” with a recommendation to mercy, “ on
account of a doubt they had as to whether he was
the man who did it.” .

Albert-street, Brisbane, goods of a similar class to
that retailed by the leading West-end hosiers.

(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
An alarm from the hulks on the river ! a shouting
and baying of hounds,
And the boil shrieking out in a fury that a convict
has broken the bounds.
Ere the gang-, had returned from the quarries,
that in shadows of twilight were draped,
One amongst them, one dare-devil Maurice, had
“ ovalled ” his rings and escaped ;
When the warders, ere daylight was sped, came
to muster their villainous charge,
The intelligence speedily spread that “Two Hun-
dred and Three ” was at large.
Then the stillness on river and shore the alarm-
bell discordantly broke,
And the signal-guns’ rancorous roar ev’ry echo to
action awoke.
Down the stream, thus recalled, came the boats,
with their scowling-eyed, dark-visaged loads,
The b:oad-arrow upon their grey coats, clay-
-1 e (neared from their toil on the roads.
And tne ships, which had lain all deserted, gently
rolled by the river’s light swells,
Hordes invaded, dark-faced and brown-shirted,
who went growling below to their cells.
Ere the last link of daylight had parted, with a
difficult task to discharge,
Armed and wary the warders had started on the
track of the convict at large.
But the trail was not easy to follow, and the
forests were gloomy and grey,
And in ev’ry dark fog-haunted hollow, twenty men
might have hidden away ;
All the marshes were screened in obscurity, and
the reeds by the river grew high,
Where the water-fowl built in security, and the
outcast and hunted might lie.
Haunts no sunlight could ever make cheerful,
where the gleam of the keen wintry moon
Showed the hulks lying, sombre and fearful, in a
crescent of misty lagoon.
So the morning came in with the sun, and the day-
light illumined the marge
Of the swamp where the search had begun, and
“ Two Hundred and Three ” still at large.
Hunted down like some beast of ill-omen that the
trappers were zealous to snare,
Game this badgered and ravenous thing, driven
out of his poisonous lair.
Whilst the vapours rose thickest around him,
rising densely from marshland and fen,
He had stolen forth down to the seaport, to the
houses—-and prisons —of men ;
Through the streets in the silence of midnight,
creeping onward, soiled, tattered and chased,
Did he slink in the shadows of walls, with a guilty
and desperate haste.
And so down to the sea-bitten crags, where the
jaws of great caverns lay wide,
Which the waves, like grim janitors, closed with
the bars and the bolts of the tide.
Here, a week, in the clefts of the rocks, like an
animal, crouching, he lay,
Only treading the sands when the moon, like a
Venus, rose out of the bay;
Here he hungered, afraid of the day, and yet
dreading the phantoms of night,
Like a creature that Heaven had banned, and cast
out of the pale of its light.
Still the search went relentlessly on, for a price
had been set on his head,
And the country was out at his heels, to recapture
him, living or dead ;
Not a nook, not a cranny was there that the
searchers unvisited left,
Till the felon fled forth in the night, of his last
rocky refuge bereft.
’Twas a night when the turbulent wind sent a
voice over mountain and plain,
When the tempest—a madman let loose—came to
smite all the land with its rain ;
When there rested a thunderous frown on the
lowering brows of the sky,
And the heavens were furrowed, as though by
the flash of a passionate eye,
Then this tigerish beast of the chase bent his
head, with a curse, to the blast,
As he doubled and ran like a hare, till pursuers
were distanced at last.
Then the elements wielded the knout in the
powerful hands of the gale,
And they wrung from him groanings of anguish,
as they whipped him with merciless hail;
It was then, when he felt that endurance had
attained to its limits at last,
That he saw a faint pencil of light through the
gloom in a lull of the blast;
And the turn of a slippery road, as the storm fora
time grew less bitter,
Brought him, panting and wet and exhausted, to
the lonely bark-hut of a splitter.
There was hope in his callous despair of the shelter
that Nature denied,
But his hand, raised to knock, was arrested by the
murmur of voices inside.
So he listened, and placing his eye to a knot-hole
that seamed the bark wall,
He beheld to what abyss of want those contrived
in God’s imago may fall.
’Twas a cheerless and comfortless room, scarcely
lit by some smouldering wood ;
In the cupboard, bare shelves for the hungry ; a
few crumbs on the table for food ;
Through the cracks in the roof feU the rain, and
the wind whistled keen as a knife—
The convict looked closer and saw, o’er the coals
crouched, a man and his wife.
“ Hear the wind !” said the man, with a shiver,
“a wintry night, stormy and bleak ;
God help the poor wretch from the hulks, who’s
been wand’ring at large all the week,
If he’s not found a shelter to-night. Ah ! he
can’t be more hopeless than we,
For it’s poverty, wife, on this earth that’s the
fetter of those that are free.
There’s a hundred pound set on his head. Quite
a fortune; God help him !” he sighed.
“Oh, Dan, Dan, if we only could get it!” the
woman, in agony, cried.
“A hundred pounds! Dan, it would save her,
and the little life’s ebbing away,”
And the convict’s eye followed the mother’s to the
bed where a dying child lay.
All the storms that were raging around him waged

a war in the criminal’s breast,
But the voice of compassion found entry and set
evil for ever at rest;
From its fastenings torn open, the door quickly
yields to a blow from his fist,
And he stands pale and haggard before them,
with the fragments of chain on his wrist.
“ I am he whom the Law sets its price on ! ” this
he cries looking jaded and wild,
“ Come and chain me and claim your reward ; ’tis
my life for the life of your child ! ”
In the morning came troopers, hard riding, to the
splitter’s hut under the hill,
And the convict, some ten days in hiding, was to
herd with the criminals still.
There were few knew the story I’ve told, until
Heath had made out his discharge ;
But the child, who yet lived to grow old, owed her
life to the Convict at Large.

Dear Bulletin, — During Sir Geo. Grey’s
Governorship of Maoriland, and at the time th e
war was in progress 'at Korarareka, Bay of
Islands, he was standing on a slight elevation
wa,telling an attack by friendly natives and
colonial troops on a stronghold of the common
enemy. The combined force? succeeded in taking
possession of th s e “ pah,” when a friendly native
chief, standing by Sir George, in his excitement,
cried out “E pai ana.” (It is good.) ' Grey,
whose knowledge of the Maori language was then
only a slight one, asked the native the meaning of
his exclamaflon. On the chief replying “It is
good,” the Governor said, “Yes, I understand
that ‘pai’ is the Ma.ri word for ‘good,’ but
what do the words ‘e’ and ‘ana’ signify?”
This puzzled the chief, but ho eventually gave Grey
to understand that the prefix and suffix had no
significant meaning and were only used to indicate
the tense, as “ I -pai ana ” would read “It was
good.” Sir George explained to the Maori that
this seemed strange to him as every English word
had a meaning of its own, no matter how placed in
a sentence. Presently, the English troops, with
one voice, shouted “ Hip-Hip-Hurrah ! ” The
chief asked the Governor the meaning of the cry,
and he explained it as a shout of victory. Here
tlic native nbn-plussed Grey by saying that he
always understood “ Hurrah ” to be a cry of
victory, but what was the meaning of “ Hip-Hip?”
—Wini Kerki.
Apropos of wrecks in general, here is a
suggestion. Why do not all ocean-going vessels
carry a powerful rocket-apparatus of their own ?
When a wreck takes place, on almost any part of
the coast, there is invariably someone on the shore
to. run about aimlessly, and scream for help, and
this individual could always catch a rope—unless
he is a complete idiot—-when it is fired at him.
But there is.no means of firing a rope at him, and
the rocket apparatus is invariably from 10 to 500
miles away across a bumpy country, and can’t be
got on the scene in time. The one necessity of
the ease is to get the stranded vessel and the
rocket apparatus together ; the apparatus never is
there—the vessel always is, therefore the
apparatus should be on board it. The vessel, in
fact, is the one feature which is never absent at a
wreck, and if the rocket arrangements were fixed
to it they would never be absent either. There is
no going behind this logic.
