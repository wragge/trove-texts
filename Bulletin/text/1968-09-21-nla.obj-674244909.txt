TRY AGAIN
LAST WEEK in the House of Rep-
resentatives, Liberal member Mr. H. J.
Bate was brushed off by the Postmaster-
General, Mr. Hulme, when he com-
plained that an item in the ABC’s “This
Day Tonight” on the four prospective
candidates for the new Sydney elec-
torate of Prospect was slanted in favor
of the ALP. Mr. Hulme said: “It is
obvious there has been balance oyer
time on the ABC.” Perhaps Mr. Bate
might try again this week with the
seat of Melbourne; every newspaper,
radio station, and television channel in
the country has concentrated on the
Labor candidates here to the complete
exclusion of the Liberal.
A REAL AUSSIE
IN -BETWEEN his bouts of concern
about the betterment of “the Aussie
male’s image,” actor Rod Taylor talked
in Sydney this week about his next
film — an encounter with the “now
generation” and Italian director
Michelangelo Antonioni. “It’s called
‘Zabriski’s Point’ — at least that’s what
I think it’s called.
“Hey, Paul!” he said, standing up
and momentarily deserting his first beer
of the day. “Is that right?” His man-
ager, Paul Ross, appeared, confirmed
the title and even spelt it. “I’m not
always this vague about my work,”
Taylor said. “It’s just that Antonioni
keeps changing the title — writes it on
little bits of paper all the time.”
Taylor, who must by now hold the
title of Australia’s most assiduously
rugged expatriate film actor, was in
Sydney for the premiere of his new
film, “The High Commissioner,” in
which, as he kept saying very proudly,
he’s playing “an Aussie for the first
time.”
His arrival in Australia had been
preceded by two news stories — one
about his gallant part in breaking up
a fight in a London discotheque, the
other, Zsa Zsa Gabor’s complaint that
he wasn’t talking to her, even though
she had a “crush” on him.
“Ah, Zsa Zsa,” he said, smiling
reminiscently, “she’d get publicity out
of passing the salt. A great broad,
though, a great broad.”
But back to Antonioni. He had
specially requested Taylor for his new
film, which will be his first American
production. “And they’re giving him
carte blanche to do it, too. After all,
‘Blow Up’ made $22 million. They’re
giving him anything he wants.”
Antonioni, it seems, has spent the
past three months travelling through
America absorbing atmosphere for the
film. “Yes,” said Taylor, “he nearly
got hit on the head in Chicago.”
In what he. describes as a departure
for him, Taylor plays “a lawyer who
thinks he’s young and with-it, but
isn’t. He can’t understand the kids.
He falls in love with his secretary who’s
one of the kids, and she in turn falls
in love with this young anti-Establish-
ment kind of guy. At least that’s how
I think it is. And I don’t throw a
punch in the whole film.”
The role will be a departure for
Taylor in more than one respect. Most
of his recent films have been co-
production arrangements involving his
own production company. With An-
tonioni he will merely be an actor
being directed.
But in nine months’ time (an opti-
mistic estimate, he admits), he is
hoping to help finance and take part in
an Australian film in collaboration with
Goldsworthy Productions. It’s the much
bruited “Last Bus to Banjo Creek”
(“‘The African Queen’ on a truck”),
the script of which Taylor has had for
three years.
He had spoken to Reg Goldsworthy
of Goldsworthy Productions in Holly-
wood, been “amazed at his guts” and
offered to do everything he could to
help.
But, he said, playing a familiar tune,
the Australian Government must help
form a film industry here as govern-
ments in other countries have. There
were, we hinted delicately, distribution
problems in Australia, as well, and Mr.
Taylor replied just as delicately that
he was “having a cunning little lunch”
with Sir Norman Rydge of Greater
Union Theatres. “I’d really like to come
back here to live — if there was a film
industry I could work in,” he said.
LITERARY LAUNCH
THERE WAS no shortage of reasons
for one literary party held in Sydney
last week. It celebrated the appearance
of two new novels, a new publishing
company, and a new bookshop.
Colonel Alex Sheppard launched his
company, Alpha Books, with novels by
Keith Thomas and Gwen Kelly at a
party in Jim Thorburn’s Pocket Book-
shop, which has just moved from Pitt
Street to decidedly more spacious pre-
mises at the right end of King Street.
Thorburn and Sheppard were cele-
brating together, because both their
ventures have in common the element
of risk. Thorburn is expanding his
business in a high-rent area, while Shep-
pard is starting out as an independent
publisher at a time when overseas pub-
lishers are showing more interest than
ever before in the Australian market.
A bookseller for 18 years in Sydney,
he recently brought out Bethia Foote’s
account of the career of Jack Lang
“Dismissal of a Premier,” reputedly
rejected by other publishers, and its
success has enabled him to begin pub-
lishing books regularly.
At last week’s party, paperback copies
of Keith Thomas’ “There Was A Man
About Town,” and Gwen Kelly’s “The
Red Boat,” were piled seductively near
the doorway in handsome covers
designed by Transfield Prize winner
Gwen Kelly and Keith Thomas ...
paperback party
Harry Williamson, but their authors, or
one of them, anyway, looked less than
confident.
Gwen Kelly was calm enough, since
this is her second novel—the first about
the Depression was published several
years ago by Heinemann’s—but Keith
Thomas, a solicitor making his debut
as a novelist, seemed hardly enchanted
by the experience. As somebody said,
Thomas reminded him of one of Kings-
ley Amis’ heroes who had a habit of
saying “bum, bum” under his breath in
times of distress.
“Don’t look at it—l can’t,” he said
with mild distaste to us as we picked
up a copy of his book which is set in
contemporary Sydney.
How long had he taken to write it?
“Well, every Friday night I had the
choice of going out and ruining myself
for the rest of the weekend or staying
in and writing. So I suppose I worked
on it one day in a fortnight.
“I actually wrote it quite quickly,

but it’s been hanging around for a long
time—too long for a book like this. A
few years, in fact. I wrote it because I
like novels. Few people do, really. I
wanted to keep the storytelling element
going rather than getting involved in
analysis.”
And had he succeeded? “I don’t
know. I couldn’t bear to look at it
afterward.”
“The Red Boat” is set “half in
Australia and half in Canada,” the
latter part inspired by a year Mrs.
Kelly spent in Quebec with her hus-
band, Professor Maurice Kelly, now in
the Chair of Classics at the Uni-
versity of New England. She is a
Sunday-morning novelist, since the rest
of the week is occupied by her work
as a teachers’ college lecturer.
Colonel Sheppard’s next book, a
piece of non-fiction about the status
of women, comes out in November. It’s
been put together by Joan Clarke and
Zoe O’Leary who have worked to-
gether before on television and radio
scripts, and the title has yet to be
decided.
The authors have suggested “Girl
Friday,” Colonel Sheppard has put up
“Feet Unbound,” while somebody else
has offered “Second-Class Citizen?” —
“with a picture of a girl on the front
so people won’t think it’s about
Aborigines.”
And after the party he told us he’d
just received a letter of congratulations
from writer George Jonhston, who was
delighted by Keith Thomas’ novel. We
hoped he’d pass the news on to Mr.
Thomas as quickly as possible.
READING ON THE WING
JANET BAKER, the English mezzo-
soprano touring Australia, is explicit
about what it takes to make her at
home in a new city—a library ticket.
She had arrived from Melbourne just
a few hours before her Press conference
in Sydney last week, but she was
already equipped with the all-important
card. She reads philosophy, psychology,
but on tour can’t buy books because of
luggage problems, so borrows them
instead.
“No, nobody’s given me advice about
my reading. A few years ago I was
awarded an honorary doctorate of music
at one of the English universities, and
I asked one of the professors to make
up a reading list for me, but he said
that was no good — I should obey my
instincts and read what interested me.
Then I’d get the most out of it.”
She was born in York, still has a
soft North of England accent, and
apparently equable temperament and no
theatrical mannerisms. She was even
tolerant about critics. “I’m influenced
by them. I’m always thrilled by praise
— I never get enough. And sometimes
a hurtful remark by a critic is right.”
Her parents were her earliest
critics. After losing out in their wish
that she study Arts at university, they
insisted she try seriously to become a
singer, so she gave up her job in a
bank and went to London to study.
“I took a part-time job in an eve-
ning college, because I think it’s wrong
to use your voice simply to earn a liv-
ing. A young singer should let the voice
rest until it’s ready.”
Hers was ready in 1956 when she
won the “Daily Mail’s” Kathleen
Ferrier Award “the right publicity
at a tricky time when I was making
the transition from advanced student
to professional.”
Her part in master classes given by
Lotte Lehmann at Wigmore Hall
accomplished the important business
of having her name accepted on the
books of an agent, and the later steps
were easier. 'Her international repu-
tation was fully established four years
ago with her first American, tour, and
she has been touring almost con-
tinuously ever since with her husband
and manager, Mr. J. K. Shelley..
She is, she says, tiring of tours.
“After 1969, I won’t do the long tours
any more. They’ll be split into five-
week periods. We’ve only been at home
for a few weeks this year.”
But on the question of the right
retirement age for a singer, she is
not so sure. “I think it all depends
oh your health although a singer’s
life is shorter now than it was in Dame
Nellie’s time since you sing more and
travel more.
“I just hope there’ll be somebody
around to tell me to stop.” Mr. Shelley
thought that the critics might do that
for her, and Miss Baker agreed, al-
though she said she’d rather hear it
from her mother. “If she’s still alive,.
I think she’ll tell me.”

THE CONTINUING
SANCTIFICATION OF
MR. KELLY
HERE in Victoria, we are most grateful
to Ned Kelly. If only he had gone to
a public school it would have been
perfect. We have had numerous Kelly
plays. We have had the Kelly musical
“The Long Drop.” Dame Mabel
Brookes in her book “Riders of Time”
said: “If a cog had slipped in time, the
Kelly boys would have been on Galli-
poli, one probably a VC winner.”
The truth is that our Ned has never
been so popular. Day by day he is
being sanctified, and there is a feeling
that he could be right for a post-
humous knighthood in the New Year’s
honors. He also has rich commercial
“It’s a pleasure to have your business,
Mr. Kelly!”
value. General Motors have found him
good for selling Holdens, and recently
there was an ad in the “Straits Times,”
Singapore: “From the land of Ned
Kelly. The greatest bushranger of them
all • Holden. This wagon is as much
at home in the bush as it is in Kuala
Lumpur and Singapore.”
What’s more, there is now on the
market an Australian whisky called
“Ned Kelly Australian Outlaw Whisky.”
It is sold in the U.S. and elsewhere
and on the wrapper there is a full
account of Ned’s exploits.
There are now Tourist Bureau tours
to the Kelly country. Transwell’s Com-
mercial Hotel in Beechworth has a
Kelly bar,„ complete with a picture of
Ned, and if you ask the barman nicely
he will indicate the exact spot where
Kelly himself is alleged to have stood
and had a pint.
You can buy a Kelly sticker for your
car, a Kelly silk scarf which depicts
in full color the Kelly exploits, and,
in time for the Christmas market, one
manufacturer will have on sale com-
plete sets of Kelly armor done in the
toughest plastic.
And, if you check the bibliography,
unquestionably Mr. Kelly is Australia’s
greatest son. No other career, not even
that of Sir Donald Bradman, has been
so minutely scrutinised. Why, two
Kelly books actually came out on the
one day last week. One was “Ned Kelly
Man and Myth,” an account of the
Kelly Easter symposium of 1967 at
Wangaratta, covered on this page on
April 8, 1967. Book launchings these
days need a well-oiled gimmick, and
Cassell’s turned on a beauty for this
one.
They had it at the old Melbourne
Jail in Russell Street, a mid-Victorian
horror which has been mostly disused
since 1934. It was here that Ned was
hanged. So at 11.30 a.m. Cassell’s pro-
vided “Red Ned” (oh; wasn’t that a
touch?), cheese, and Carr’s Table Water
Biscuits. Glen Tomasetti sang the “Ned
Kelly Gang Ballad,” allegedly written by
Joe Byrne, and we stood there, a little
selfconsciously sipping our claret, look-
ing up to the galleries past those chill-
ing little stone cells to the very spot
where Ned went for the long drop. The
police dressed a gentleman in the orig-
inal Kelly armor, he was photographed
by all the TV cameras, and as he
walked along the historic last walk there
seemed something sacrilegious about it,
as if we were performing a Black
Mass. Mr. Jim Moad, of Cassell’s,
thanked the Chief Commissioner of
Police, Mr. Arnold, for allowing the
function to take place. And one thought
actually it was very decent of Mr.
Arnold, considering what Ned said in
the book of police: “. . . Big, ugly, fat-
necked, wombat-headed, big-bellied,
magpie-legged, narrow-hipped, splay-
footed sons of Irish bailiffs or English
landlords.” After the function copies of
the new book were delivered to Mel-
bourne book shops in armored cars.
The second book, published by Hill
of Content, is called “Ned Kelly, the
Legend and the Man,” by M. J. Jen-
nings. Actually the book is a paperback,
but it comes in a satchel complete with
a full kit of Kellyana. For example, you
get a souvenir picture of Joe Byrne’s
body just as it was when it was put on
display outside the Benalla Police
Station. You get prints of the Stringy-
bark affair out of the “Illustrated Aus-
tralian News,” shots of Mr. Justice.
Barry, a Nolan in full color, extracts on
the Glenrowan incident taken from Mel-
bourne “Punch,” a reward notice, a pro-
clamation, resolutions passed at the the
huge anti-hanging meeting at the Mel-
bourne Hippodrome on October 30,
1880, and three letters from Kelly to
the Marquis of Normandy, Governor
of Victoria.
These letters were found in the
Crown Law Department, Melbourne,
only a few months ago. They were
written on November 3,5, and 10, the
last on the day before Kelly was
hanged. They have not been published
before, and the find can only be
described as a major Kelly literary
coup. One letter tells that at Stringy-
bark Creek Kelly was not looking for
revenge against the police, they were
on a peaceful mission, looking for gold
and setting up a still to make whisky.
The news that the Kelly gang was actu-
ally in the whisky business in 1879 must
be very good news to the makers of
the Ned Kelly whisky in 1968.
In letter number two, Kelly gives his
version of the battle of Glenrowan. He
insists that the police were the attackers
and that he never intended to slaughter
the police relief force by sending the
train down the gorge. His original
intention was to get the stationmaster
to stop the train at Glenrowan on the
excuse that it could go no farther
because of the derailing. He would tell
the police the train could not go back-
ward because of a tin of powder, and
then the gang in their armor would
disarm the force, take them into the
bush, and hold them to ransom.
He proposed, then, to tell the superin-
tendent that if he sent any more police
he would kill his hostages. Furthermore,
he would keep the police in captivity.
The price for their release was that
they should release his mother from
jail.
Of course, the schoolteacher, Cur-
now, warned the train and the beauti-
fully prepared plan went awry. The-
last letter is quite a moving docu-
ment. Here he has obviously given
up all hope and he is merely explain-
ing the cause. He advances the theory
that he wore armor really to save life,
so that he could ride up to banks
without shooting, and he said: “The
two years’ career of me and my com :
panions will show that we were any-
thing but bloodthirsty and likewise
within the whole of our career we never
ill-used or ill-treated man, woman, or
child and always refrained from doing
a cowardly act.”
He finishes by asking the Governor
to release his mother from jail and
that his body might be buried in con-
secrated ground.
Perhaps the most interesting feature
for those who believe Ned Kelly was
bordering on literary greatness is this.
—each letter was signed with a cross.
It seems certain that Kelly could
neither read nor write.

Christie, jun., mopping ginger-cake
crumbs from his moustache and lighting
his third cigarette in half an hour. No
wonder he chain-smokes. In this game,
as he calls the production of family
crests, it is all go. He was working, for
instance, till 12.30 the other night, and
then there was the washing-up, which
made it 12.35 before he could get to
bed. Honestly, if he didn’t make him-
self model aeroplanes during ltinch he
would go mad.
Mr. Christie sits, wan and in shirt-
sleeves, in his office, which is on the
second floor of 147 a King Street, Syd-
ney, and which lies to the right, on leav-
ing the lift, of Edith Smith’s dress-suit
and tuxedo-hire place. Edith’s got a
couple of callow youths returning some
kit, Mr. Christie’s got Mrs. Beatrice
Collins in the showroom dusting down
tartan rugs with a clothesbrush and
thinking it’s about time to pack and send
out the latest batch of family crests. First
wrap them in tissue paper, then thick
brown, then stick on the distinctive
Christie label, which is large and green
and has a gentleman in full Highland
regalia striding through the printed
address playing a full set of bagpipes.
Without one iota of puff. On account
of its distinctiveness, says Mr. Christie,
there’s no need to register the crests.
You know, postmen remember if
they’ve gone astray. There is also Miss
Dianne Cameron darting around in a
multi-striped mini and wearing—she’s
very proud of it—her Cameron family-
crest brooch. An invisible person is
working at a sewing-machine running
up a few quick kilts. The genuine slow
one is 90 percent handstitched. No one
realises the work involved. Normally,
Mr. Bill Christie, sen., is here, turning
his hand to anything—for example, the
final assembly of a ceremonial sash or
feather bonnet—but today he is in the
bush measuring some pipers for Black
Watch kilts.
So his son holds the fort and is
working at the moment under. some
pressure. There are constant interrup-
tions, viz.: the arrival of dry-cleaning
which he has been six months sending,
people were nearly complaining, and
the telephone rings and the doors open
and close and no one comes through.
He sips man-strength tea and flips
through The Glamis Triplicate Carbon
Book. It’s difficult upside down, but
that’s his sketch of the crest, the motto,
who’s ordered it, what size, 9in. by
Bin. for $13.85, or lOin. by 12in. for
$18.35, available in rosewood or teak.
He’s working on a new line for front
doors, which he thinks will go well, a
metal-and-wood job for $lO. Actually,
there are some crest-makers, no names
please, who are not above letting any-
one have any crest they ask for, but
not Mr. Christie. If his Fairbairn’s book
or “Kith and Kin” shows no relation,
they’ve had it. Mind you, there is noth-
ing to stop a Greek National collecting
all 450 Scottish plaques. These are what
he calls man in the street ordinary
rank-and-file crests. But if anyone
came for a Full Achievement they’d
Bill Christie ...you can hang a crest
anywhere
have to produce a charter. Full
Achievement. Mr. Christie melts into a
state that borders on ecstasy. What he
wouldn’t give for a Full Achievement.
That is, the crest of the head of a
clan. He thought he had one once. A
fellow comes in about six months ago
and hands him a print to make up.
Mr. Christie says that’ll cost between
$135 and $270, and he never came back.
What does he find? It belongs to the
Marquis of Rockingham, an English
title that passed out in the 1700 s.
The nearest to that was the appear-
ance of the Hon. Simon Dewar of
the whisky family, who had his kilt
renovated, and someone else who sent
their drum in to be refurbished, the
emblazonment had been bashed up.
He sighs. It took him ten solid hours
to draw the Rockingham Full Achieve-
ment and he’s kept it hanging on the
wall to remind him. “Actually, in this
game people want to see what they’re
getting, so it’s a good sample to have.”
He lights his tenth cigarette and says
now they’re expanding and taking in
English, Irish, and Welsh family
crests. Of which there are legions to
follow up, if only he can get the right
reference books. Oh, but he has one
beautiful Irish crest he can show this
minute. It is a sword, crown, and bird
unmounted as yet on white velvet, and
kept in a Giant Pack President Quick
Freeze Peas plastic bag for safety.
That’s the Sullivan clan. And on the
far side an enormous Fraser family-
crest drawing which is going to be used
in the hall of a large house on the
South Coast . . . “unless, to use a
colloquial expression, they are bully-
ing me along a bit.” He sincerely hopes
not. He had terrible trouble getting it
that size, his photographic enlarger
wouldn’t take it. Actually, family
crests mdke marvellous presents. He
had a tremendous rush for Father’s Day
and anticipates an even better reaction
for Christmas. People can hang them
anywhere. In hallways, bedrooms, any-
where conspicuous, he supposes bath-
rooms, but has his doubts. Some people
actually have family-crest rooms.
Mrs. Collins’ crest-packing is inter-
rupted. There is a sudden run on
daggers.

LABOR LOOKS FOR ELECTION ISSUES
Comment by Alan Reid
ANY defence policy announced before
Australia knows who is the new United
States President and the South-East
Asian policy of his administration must
be tentative. With the Government
determined to keep Australian policy
closely meshed with U.S. policy, this is
inevitable.
The Government knows this. Labor
knows this.
To some extent, this realisation by
Labor of the Government’s difficulties
in producing a defence policy which
will have the merit of credibility prior
to the clarification of the United
States’ position was behind some of the
manoeuvres over the F-11l last week.
Labor has nursed a grievance against
the F-11l project ever since Sir Robert
Menzies, then Prime Minister,
announced the proposed purchase of
the F-11l just before the 1963 elections
—which were fought largely on defence
issues and went on to win con-
vincingly.
The escalation of the price of the
24 planes, described by the former Air
Minister Peter Howson as a “Cadillac
of the air” and with greater cleverness
by Labor’s Noel Beaton as a “flying
opera house,” and its politically erod-
ing record of crashes and defects, pro-
vided Labor with a basis for attack on
performance as well as political
grounds.
When, on the very day that Defence
Minister Allen Fairhall was accepting
delivery of the first of Australia’s 24
F-llls another defect was discovered,
the Government’s embarrassment was
inescapable.
But, important as it was to Labor
to discredit the Government’s judgment
in selecting such an aircraft and enter-
ing into an open-ended contract that
has permitted the F-lll’s cost to soar
from an original $ll2 million to $268
million, even more important to Labor
politically has been to open a credibility
gap on the Government’s entire defence
policy program.
Though the timetable is now getting
almost restrictively tight and Prime
Minister John Gorton has neither com-
mitted himself publicly nor finally made
up his mind, Labor has been and still is
fearful of a snap election this year.
Labor does not want one. Though it
believes it would make gains and that
it reached its nadir when the late
Harold Holt led the Liberal-Country
Party Coalition to its record victory in
1966, it senses an atmosphere of stale-
mate: it cannot detect any overwhelm-
ing electoral enthusiasm for either the
Government or itself.
Additionally, Labor would sooner
sort out the problems produced for it
by the proposed electoral redistribution
in other than the atmosphere of an
election campaign.
Labor has been casting round for the
issue on which Mr. Gorton could go
to the electorate if he decides to strike.
Labor would have no trouble in pro-
viding issues. The F- 111 could provide
one. Commonwealth-State relationships
and a better deal for the States on
which Labor s potential to make poli-
tical capital has been strengthened by
the campaign launched by N.S.W.
Premier Robin Askin against the Com-
monwealth s alleged meanness is
another Then there are all kinds of
\Z V Z , r . e b w , a " d,n 8 T eS ’
hke the announced hkehhood of an
,n P«ro Ipnces, etnergtng para-
r -1 r'V'/ 1 j tj s *
?ove™ 7 ’ difficulties the
Government is experiencing over its
proposed wheat stabilisation scheme.
Mr. Gorton, if he went to the people,
obviously would not want to leave
Labor to provide the issues. He would
be seeking to provide at least the major
one himself.
At this stage, the only issue that
Labor can see for Mr. Gorton is a
mandate for a new defence policy based
upon the defence assessment which is
already in his hands.
But if Mr. Gorton went to an
election this year it would be before
the new United States President was
installed and had unfolded the United
States’ proposed defence policy for the
South-East Asian and Pacific areas.
As one Labor Member said this week,
for Australia to announce its defence
policy in those circumstances would be
like Czechoslovakia stating the defence
plans for Eastern Europe without refer-
ence to the Soviet Union.
There is logic in this viewpoint. But
politically there is a difference between
having logic on your side and being
able to sell to the voting public that
you have logic on your side.
For this reason, Labor has to estab-
lish a distrust in the public mind
concerning judgments that the Gov-
ernment has already made in the
defence field and raise doubts about
the degree of trust that can be placed
in the Government’s statements defend-
ing those judgments.
Probably the worst blow struck
against the “distrust” operation was
Mr. Gorton’s instruction to the
Attorney - General, Nigel Bowen, to
attempt to disentangle the classified
section from the financial aspects of
the F-11l deal so that the financial
aspects can be made known to the
Parliament.
From a strictly political viewpoint,
Labor would undoubtedly have pre-
ferred Mr. Gorton to have turned
thumbs down wholly on its request for
tabling of the F-11l documents.
Secrecy always helps to breed distrust.
Australia’s defence policy, like
Czechoslovakia’s in Europe, cannot be
framed realistically except in the
context of the policy of the major
power in the region, and in our region
the policies of the major power cannot
be known with any precision until after
the new U.S. administration is in office
and operating.
TIME FOR "REVOLUTIONARY ADJUSTMENTS"
Comment by Frank Roberts
IT MIGHT NOT be possible for Aus-
tralia to find all the immigrants it
needs, but it should be possible to find
the equivalent working, earning, and
spending capacity of quite a large num-
ber of them by shedding some common
prejudices, altering some attitudes,
becoming willing not only to allow but
to go out of our way to encourage any
Australian who wants to work to do so.
This may seem a simple proposition,
but on consideration proves not quite
as simple as it seems. Employers who
despair because they cannot find juniors
among the few hundred thousand who
leave school each year rarely look
among the million or so in the 60-70
age-group to fill even the most mechani-
cal, futureless jobs the young disdain.
It might involve the employer and his
staff in too much bother one way or
another. Similar thought is applied to
part-time employment.
Community prejudice stands in the
way of one group of Australians, among
whom are many who would like to
work, earn, and spend, often for per-
fectly good reasons, but who are
inclined to bow to community pressure
because they are the mothers of the
nation’s million or so pre-school
children. So well embedded is the idea
that their place is in the home, what-
ever their circumstances, that even the
thought of going out to work apparently
makes them feel guilty. So much so that
in the whole of New South Wales only
about 1000 of their children attend
Nursery Schools’ Association centres,
This surprising figure conceals the
unknown number of small children who
are left in the care of relatives, neigh-
bors, and licensed or unlicensed child-
minding centres. It further conceals
prejudice from above in that vastly
more properly staffed and equipped
centres are not being built. There are
fewer than 15 day nursery centres in
all Sydney, for instance,

want to work, want to breach the
unwritten arrangement by which
“women enter employment on finishing
their education, withdraw during
periods of family formation and growth,
and then return to employment” as
Mr. Leslie Bury put it a year or so
ago? Possibly he answered the question
when he went on to tell an interna-
tional congress on human relations:
“We are all anxious to achieve a con-
stantly rising standard of living. Our
appetite for goods and services is
insatiable.”
There is some echo of this in a recent
statement by the principal of a nursery
schools teachers’ college: “If a mother
is unhappy or frustrated because she
cannot provide what she considers an
appropriate standard of living, she may
be a better mother if she feels that she
is contributing in some material way
to their well-being. We may not agree
with the motives of mothers who work,
but we must accept their right to do
so, especially as we are prepared to
accept the contribution they make to
the workforce.”
And, to drive home her point, “We
must not allow our judgment of adults
to prevent us from seeing our respon-
sibility to children who are unable to
defend their own rights for justice.
Care of children away from their par-
ents can contribute to their future
well-being, but it can also contribute
to their everlasting unhappiness.”
The difference between this practical
view of (mostly) young mothers who
go back to work and the view that if
we ignore the fact that many do there’s
no problem is the difference between
having and not having the benefit of the
contribution they can make. This may
not be so greatly different from that
of the immigrants Australia is not
getting.
It might even turn out that mothers
who could both have their children
and have them minded while they
returned to work would be much more
inclined to have first, second, and
third children. It might be unfair to
turn Mr. Bury’s fine-sounding phrases
back on him, but in his address that
year he did seem to be saying some-
thing bright and important: “The major
problem ahead of us in this era of
rapidly accelerating technological
change is to import, as it were, an
adventurous spirit, to apply a flexible
and inquisitive attitude of mind, and
to be willing to make revolutionary
adjustments in practices.”
If we cannot have all the immigrants
we would like to have, and perhaps if,
as many people say, some of the best
immigrants would be more babies,
some of those “"revolutionary adjust-
ments” might be just the thing for the
times. It is up to our leaders to cease
groaning about the impossibility of the
impossible and bend their minds to
revolution. “Change inevitably calls for
adjustment,” Mr. Bury noted. Just as
inevitably it calls for leadership.

AUSTRALIA
No end of puzzles for John Gorton
THE WORD IS being put
around in Canberra that the
Cabinet is resolving its differences
on defence policy, and that the
Government parties are consoli-
dating behind Mr. Gorton. This
is partly a product of his im-
proved effort in the Parliament,
but also partly in preparation for
an election. It is said that Mr.
Gorton still wants an election
before the end of the year, but
isn’t announcing a date until a
number of potential obstacles are
obviously clearable.
The Leader of the House, Mr.
Snedden, would have a tough task
to program Parliamentary busi-
ness so that an election could be
held this year. Then there is
always the threat of the DLP
dragging things out in the Senate
so that there isn’t enough time
left. And though the F-11l is be-
ing contained as an issue so far, it
still has plenty of potential to
break out during the next few
weeks.
DLP Leader Gair last Thursday
told the Labor Party he would
support them in ordering the
F-11l contract papers to be tabled
in the Senate, providing the order
exempted those sections of the
contract which are of security sig-
nificance. The DLP suspects that the
papers will show the looseness of the
rush arrangements entered into before
the 1963 elections to buy the plane. It
could provide substantiation for the
charge that Liberal Governments only
get concerned about defence before
elections, and that electoral expediency
has cost the nation dearly. Meanwhile,
at least, some internal conflicts persist.
Mr. Fairhall last week announced
he was standing again for Paterson, so
ending speculation that he would retire
soon. But he is sticking to his guns
about the need for Australia to play a
larger (rather than smaller) regional
role. Speaking on ABC-TV he ended
a justification of the F-11l project by
saying: “I have just come out of a
conference in South-East Asia, the Five
Power conference, at which it suddenly
turns out that Australia is the only
nation in the area—the U.K. having
gone and the U.S. is not directly
involved—with modern defence equip-
ment. Now I believe we have an
important role to play in this area . . .”
This is, of course, yet another rejection
of the retractionist response.
The Prime Minister was last week
embarrassed by the publication, in the
newsletter “Incentive,” of the text of
Liberal Party policy - planning docu-
ments for the elections. Produced by
the Secretariat which operates under
Mr. R. Willoughby, soon to retire, the
document came out on the Fairhall
side, stating, As we see it.
“After Vietnam the American people
will increasingly oppose U.S. military
intervention in Asia unless the security
of jhe U.S. is directly threatened.
The British retreat from Singapore
appears final and rules out anything
bu, token British participation in
Southeast Asia conflicts.

« w J Xuld aim to emphasise
strongly the ideological difference be-
tween ourselves and the ALP, and we
must aim to avoid a campaign in which
the only decisive issues are separate
domestic matters, such as education,
development, and social services.”
This, of course, is the opposite of
the approach Mr. Gorton has
been developing. It also runs
counter to DLP policy and there-
fore runs the risk of losing the
support of a lot of their half-
million votes. In August, DLP
leaders warned that they were
dead against an early election
and that they might follow a
policy of elective discrimination
against Government candidates.
But, asked last week about this,
they said they hadn’t decided
what their inclination would be.
It still depends on how the Gov-
ernment formulates its defence
policy once the long-awaited
strategic review has been con-
sidered. But there is no doubt the
DLP leaders are serious.
An influential figure in the
DLP, Mr. B. Santamaria, con-
cluded an article in the journal
“Social Survey”: “With DLP
Senators, pressing the defence
policy announced by Senator
McManus, making themselves
extremely awkward to the Gov-
ernment, and the Liberal back-
benchers making themselves
equally awkward in the Liberal
Party room, the Government may
be influenced to change its policy
or the Liberals may be influenced
to change the personnel of their
Government.”
The DLP, after so many years of
returning non-Labor Governments,
cannot expect to be able to make
credible any threat to throw out Mr.
Gorton’s Government And it doesn’t
look as though it would risk Mr.
Whitlam, given his dubious political
competence and inability to run his
Partv But it could decide to
direct its campaign so the Govern*

FOREIGN AFFAIRS
SELECTIVE VIEWS
THE BUDGET DEBATE is always an
opportunity for our politicians to in-
dulge in a little chest-baring. So it
was last week in the Federal Parlia-
ment. On the appropriation of
$63,950,000 for the Department of Ex-
ternal Affairs, members spoke their
minds after having made the custom-
ary tributes to departmental officers
who had helped them during the pre-
vious year.
Dr. Cairns, obviously pondering the
possibility of being displaced from par-
liament by the electoral redistribution,
let drop the moderate pragmatic pose


he has so often adopted of late and
struck an old anti-American note: “I
think the Soviet Union has not been
as aggressive in Czechoslovakia, in pur-
suit of what she considers to be her
interests, as has the United States in
Vietnam.”
He wanted more “human feeling”
in the work of the External Affairs De-
partment: “Their approach is very tech-
nical, very abstract, and very slow. We
get the impression that it is very much
uncommitted. It seems to reflect in no
way the kind of human feeling that I
am sure ought to motivate the actions
of governments in these affairs.”
He then developed a theme of
Government “nonchalance” in Foreign
Affairs, and picked the Government’s
aid to Biafra as his example: “Tanks
can be flown across the world by air-
craft, but flour cannot be flown by the
Australian Government . . .” Though
this point was repeated by almost every
Opposition speaker who followed, and
his example faithfully requoted, it was
noticeable that none of the Government
Members bothered to make the correc-
tion: tanks simply cannot be flown
around in any aircraft Australia
possesses.
Both Opposition and Government
members developed the theme that
there was a need for Australia to speak
out more forthrightly. Labor’s Manfred
Cross, from Brisbane, expressed a
widely held view in saying that the
strong line on Rhodesia should be
matched by strong stands on other in-
fringements of human rights, such as
Czechoslovakia. Dr. Wylie Gibbs
thought we should be condemning
genocide in the Sudan and the refugee
situation in Uganda. Mr. Gordon
Bryant wanted condemnation of
Greece. Mr. Bill Hayden, a Labor Left-
winger, having described the Russian
occupation of Czechoslovakia as “an
act of international thuggery,” spoke of
the use of poison gas by the Egyptians
in the Yemen: “If peace and the rights
of man mean anything to us, we should
be speaking out in fearless denuncia-
tion of this turpitude in international
affairs. It is an artificial inspiration to
mount criticism against some, to ignore
others, and to defend a few whose stan-
dards of international morality are
corrupted ... if this world of people
is not to be destroyed in a turbulent
vortex of hate, deception, and naked
aggression, the forums and resources of
the United Nations must be more effec-
tively marshalled to promote the quest
for world peace.”
No one was surprised when the
Killens and Kent-Hugheses denounced
the United Nations and the Common-
wealth, but Pressmen seized on Mr.
Beazley’s speech along the same lines.
It has become, he said, “a menace to
the world” because of its “bias”: “The
UN can spring into indignation over
an issue like Rhodesia, but it can re-
main dumb while 100,000 Yemeni
Arabs become casualties of Egyptian
action.” And the British Common-
wealth had no “moral force”: “I know
for a certainty in my heart that next
January there will be a Prime Ministers’
Conference, to which Milton Obote,
Beazley (above)...“menace to
the world”. Hasluck (l.) ... a
lesson on principles of diplomacy.
of Uganda, and Gowon, the military
Prime Minister of Nigeria, will toddle
along to discuss the constitutional
actions of Smith, and they will be
seriously listened to, when everybody
knows that whatever menace Smith
represents he is not carrying out
genocide, he is not exterminating the
right of people to exist. We are being
manoeuvred into selective indignation.”
If Sir Wilfred Kent-Hughes went as
far as to make the bizarre suggestion
that we should be prepared to send
troops to southern Africa to maintain
security, other Government members
made sensible speeches against the
wave of moralism. Mr. Geoffrey Giles
(Liberal, S.A.) asked his colleague Dr.
Wiley Gibbs, one of the pro-Rhodes-
ians: “Is the Honorable Member for
Bowman a Member of the Parliament
for Rhodesia or for Australia? We have
to arrive at our own point of view.
We are members of the Australian
Parliament and I hope we have the
interests of this nation at heart.”
He pointed out that it would be
“quite stupid to ignore the pressures in
the continent of Africa and in South-
East Asia” for indigenous rule, what-
ever the internal consequences. “We
as a nation cannot, in the year 1968,
become associated even by implication,
with the propping up of a minority
Government because it happens to be
white.”
But it was left to Mr. Hasluck to
give the Parliament a lesson on the
first principles of diplomacy: “Instead
of suggesting that we isolate the United
Nations or (declare) it a failure, let us
face the reality that we have an ugly
world . . . nevertheless, it is the world
in which we live. It is the world
which we have to heal . . .
“If there is an occasion for Australia
to speak out ... to stand up, to be
emphatic, to thump the table, or to
start smashing something surely we
must be extremely careful in choosing
the issue, the time, and the place. In
the desperation of Samson you can pull
the walls down around your ears and
dispose of yourself while you dispose
of your enemies.”
NEW SOUTH WALES
THE BEGGING BOWL
IT CERTAINLY was a week for high-
flying figures: $lOOO million for New
Guinea, $266 million plus for the F-11l
aircraft, $B5 million for the Sydney
Opera House and, according to the
N.S.W. Health Minister, Mr. Jago,
$5OO million needed for hospitals in
his State.
What was remarkable about the
final estimate, given by the N.S.W.
Works Minister, Mr. Davis Hughes, on
the Opera House was that politically,
if not aesthetically, he had pulled it
off. Even the massive pro-Utzon forces
could hardly raise a murmur, their
cause, however noble, now finally hav-
ing bored everyone, including probably
themselves, to extinction.
“The Australian” and the “Daily
Mirror,” which had earlier mounted
a strong Bring-back-Utzon campaign,
had very little to say, the “Daily
Mirror” being preoccupied at the
moment with something very much
more their meat demanding a
parliamentary inquiry into organised
crime in Sydney. The Leader of the
Opposition, Mr. Pat Hills, although
not the sort of person who would be
over-sensitive about his own Govern-
ment’s deficiencies when it had charge
of building the Opera House, also
seemed to think there was more politi-
cal milage for him in organised crime.
Of course, Mr. Hughes was helped
by his colleague Mr. Jago, who, at
practically the same time that Mr.
Hughes was nonchalantly giving out


Jago (l.)... “appalling conditions”
$B5 million for an opera house, was
substantiating his claim for $5OO
million for hospitals under his control
by standing on a veranda of a sub-
standard ward at Royal North Shore
Hospital and claiming that conditions
were so appalling that paraplegic
patients had to be hosed down in
summer to survive the heat.
Mr. Jago’s elaborate rattling of the
begging-bowl is obviously aimed at
opening things up a little before the
Premiers’ conference on Common-
wealth-State finance on October 4.
One may expect further revelations,
even, perhaps, Education Minister
Cutler admitting that there are over-
crowded, sub-standard schools.
Certainly the deficiencies in the
hospitals which Mr. Jago has pointed
out shouldn’t exist. Perhaps the Federal
Treasury will point out that the New
South Wales lotteries were aimed origin-
ally at helping hospitals, and if the
Opera House had been cheaper its
special lottery could even now have
been diverted to rebuilding wards at the
Royal North Shore instead of being
garnisheed permanently by Bennelong
Point.
THE WEST
SYMBOLS STILL COUNT
THE WESTERN Australian Govern-
ment is likely to finish the week red-
faced after two politically important
votes have occurred. The issues are
peculiarly Western Australian, but in
their own way will severely test the
Government’s prestige. One is whether
or not the State should have an Oms-
budsman, the other whether or not the
old Barracks archway should be resited
away from Parliament House. The
Ombudsman idea is solidly backed by
Perth’s metropolitan daily monopoly,
West Australian Newspapers, which set
up its own “paper Ombudsman” to
prove how necessary one was.
State Opposition Leader John Tonkin
has claimed that at least two Country-
Party members will defect from the
Government ranks to swing the vote
against it, and this has been backed
by Party chastisement of Members
speaking out on the issue. The Arch-
way is an even more emotive matter
and thus politically significant to
Western Australians.
Last Parliamentary session, Premier
David Brand boxed himself into a
corner by allowing a few rebels plus
the Opposition to embarrass him after
calling for a free vote on whether the
archway should continue blocking
the Parliament House vista, or should
fall with other buildings in the way of
a new freeway. Meanwhile, Labor’s
Harry Fletcher in a Private Member’s
Bill on resiting the archway has car-
ried out what is intentionally or not a
neat manoeuvre. If Mr. Brand votes
with him, as is likely, he will antag-
onise many who see in the arch a
symbol of their rights against Parlia-
ment’s whims. If not, he can be
accused of hypocrisy.
Ombudsman and Archway tend to
overshadow a more important parlia-
mentary measure also introduced in a
private Member’s Bill by Dr.
Gordon Hislop of the Upper House.
After allowing his Abortion Bill,
framed from similar British legislation,
to rest two years in the Upper House,
he is putting it forward again and
reports considerable interest in other
State Parliaments, individuals, and
groups. His Bill would allow the ter-
mination of pregnancy if a woman’s
life, or a child’s physical or mental
normalcy are at risk, or if the physical
or mental risk of an abortion is less
than the continued pregnancy. This,
according to the Western Australian
Council of Churches, amounts virtu-
ally to permission to abort at will.
BROKEN HILL
ANOTHER LAS VEGAS?
WHILE TASMANIA’S plan to be the
first State with a gambling casino pro-
ceeded to the agreement stage last week
(a Bill has still to be passed through
State Parliament) only one other place
in Australia has voiced plans of a
similar nature Broken Hill, where
business and tourist authorities are
thinking in terms of an Australian Las
Vegas.
The campaign is being spearheaded
by a master organiser, Frank Bridge-
water, tourist promoter and organiser
of the Silver City Festival. According
to him, “Broken Hill is situated in a
desert setting similar to America’s
famous Vegas. We could easily make
Broken Hill a similar resort by build-
ing casinos, luxury hotels, and an inter-
national jet airport.”
Already Broken Hill, which is usually
left to run its own affairs, has Aus-
tralia’s best organised two-up school,
extended hotel trading hours, and other
irregularities. Until a few years ago it
actually had two small casinos which
flourished openly in the main street.
They were eventually forced to close—
not by the police (who only do what
they are told) but because of insuffi-
cient patronage. The “swy” game still
operates three nights a week, patronised
mainly by gamblers among the 60,000
tourists a year who now visit the Hill
as a result of an incredibly successful
tourist drive. Traditionally, SP book-
makers used to ply their trade openly
in the 37 hotels and 12 licensed clubs
until they fell out of favor earlier this
year and had to give way to union-
backed TAB agencies.
Now the would-be promoters plan
to make a formal approach to the
N.S.W. Government for permission for
fully-fledged casinos. But all that would
really be required is the acquiescence of
the Hill’s own self-styled Government:
the Barrier Industrial Council. The BIC
does sanction indeed overlords
existing mores.
But to throw the city-State “open”
“Swy” school at Broken Hill
to big promoters and big spenders
would jeopardise the “closed shop” rule
of the BIC. And even if by chance it
did throw open the doors, the control
it would want to exercise would deter
investment of the sort of money
required. International business methods
and Broken Hill union rule would
simply not be compatible.
The risk of union strife would seem
too great. Gamblers going out to Broken
Hill for a fling would risk finding the
neon signs blacked out, with notices
proclaiming: “No blackjack tonight—
union black ban.”

Federation. The chairman of the
Federal Book Manufacturers’ group
and one of the backers of a top-gear
campaign by 23 of Australia’s major
book-printing companies, Owens was
giving a background briefing on the
gloomy prospects of Australian book
manufacturing. The printers, along
with bookbinders, plate-makers, and
other allied industries, claim that the
widespread use of Asian printers by
Australian publishers has so weakened
the local industry that work available
has dropped by half in one year.
Until the swing to Asian companies
gathered momentum around Septem-
ber, 1967, the Australian manufacturers
had competed with imported book
prices without serious challenge. While
75 percent of the total book market
consisted of imports, over 85 percent
of the imports were from the U.K.
and the United States. However, the
discovery by the publishers of the
vast cost savings of Asian printing,
an industry chiefly centred in Hong
Kong, has forced the locals to com-
pete with companies which buy duty-
free raw materials and hire labor at
one-eighth of Australian rates.
The point stressed by the spokesmen
of the Australian industry is that doub-
ling of Japanese imports in the past
two years and the trebling of Hong
Kong imports in the past 12 months
almost entirely represents a direct de-
cline of local production. A list of 257
currently available titles that have been
printed in Asian countries has been
drawn up. It shows the publishing
firms, the place of typesetting (where
this was available), and the country of
printing. The titles range from “They’re
a Weird Mob” to “Workbook for Pro-
grammed Maths Book VI.” Wilke and
Co. has issued a separate list of 21 titles,
mostly popular school texts, which the
company has lost to overseas manufac-
turers.
All but three of the large publishers
have placed orders in Hong Kong,
Japan, and Singapore. The cause of the
substantial abandonment of the Aus-
tralian printers goes beyond the com-
parative cheapness of Asian raw
materials and labor. While Asia is the
cut-throat dumping ground of paper
for all the world’s large paper produ-
cers, including Australia, Asian tech-
niques and efficiency can be compar-
able with the best - quality work in
Australia, if not better. The manager of
Sun Books, Brian Stonier, said that his
firm has found Asian processes to be
of surprisingly high quality and their
delivery times, he said, have even been
quicker than from Australian printers.
Book prices have not fallen, but pub-
lishers are not apologetic about this.
They contend that the mere fact that
retail prices have not increased con-
stitutes an important gain, particularly
in the field of educational books, and
they also argue that lower Asian costs
have enabled publishers to contem-
plate publications which could not have
been considered otherwise.

O’Neil ... the cultural significance
tralian printers who concentrate solely
on book printing, the book-manufac-
turing group alleges that this section
of their production will be in the red
in the next 12 months. Retrenchments
of labor have already occurred and
they are expected to increase. Roughly
1000 men are employed directly by
the industry and another 1000 are
employed indirectly by preliminary
processes.
The manufacturers’ group calls for
“urgent” Com’monwealth action to deal
with the impending “grievous situation.”
As all parties conceded that for cul-
tural and political reasons it would be
impossible to impose duties on the
import of manufactured books, several
other methods of bringing relief are
advanced. A bounty on all books pro-
duced in Australia is regarded as the
best method of offsetting the disability
of high w?iges and material costs. This
is estimated to cost Canberra $1 million
to $1,500,000.
If this method meets with disfavor
the printers advocate the removal of
all duties on the import of all the
components of book production. The
dumping duties are seen as the main
stumbling block. If they were removed,
printers could import papers and
materials from the Asian dumping
area. Alternatively, a bounty on raw
materials used in manufacture would
produce the same result. Other pos-
sible forms of assistance include tax-
ation concessions, increased postage
preference, a copyright clause which
requires Australian production to satisfy
copyright regulations, additional export
allowances, and a requirement that all
texts used by education departments
should be locally printed.
To date, the Government has shown
interest in the situation by supplying
Department of Trade officers to assist
five leading figures in the book-printing
field who have formed a “working
party” to analyse the problems and pre-
pare detailed submissions. The Federal
Government will be presented with this
report late this month.
On an official level the Australian
publishers are solidly behind the print-
ing industry. Mr. Lloyd O’Neil, group
general manager of F. W. Cheshire and
executive vice-president of the Aus-
tralian Book Publishers’ Association, said
that the publishers were the first to see
the situation on the horizon and
approached both the printers and the
Trade Department two and a half years
ago.
While his association gave unanimous
support at its last general meeting to
a resolution which exhorted the Govern-
ment “to remove any impediments on
the importation of materials which
prevent the printing industry from be-
ing on equal terms with overseas print-
ers,” Mr. O’Neil balanced this view with
the cultural and economic significance
of allowing Australian publishing to
keep in “the mainstream of internat-
ional publishing.” “Our prices must
reflect these international levels,” he
said.
The point would not have been
lost on Wilke and Co., one of the
largest printing groups in Australia.
Last Friday in Melbourne the Prime
Minister, Mr. Gorton, officially opened
their new Clayton plant.
They intend to keep it in full produc-
tion.
CRIMEWAYS
"MR. BIG" OR "MR. WIG"
ON THE MAT before Cabinet this
week to answer Opposition and Press
demands for a crackdown on organised
crime, especially the activities of “Mr.
Sin” (vice), “Mr. Big” (all-rounder),
and “Mr. Rich” (counterfeiting, etc.),
N.S.W. Police Commissioner Norman
Allan could hardly be expected to spare
a thought just now for a bizarre pursuit
in which lesser felons have been busy
lately wig-snatching.
Wig thievery, matching the vogue for
wearing them, has spread across
Sydney recently. It appears to be mainly
a professional operation, with some
amateurs on the fringe, such as one
whose unsophisticated burglary equip-
ment was a house brick and strawberry
jam spread on a shop’s plateglass
window to deaden the shattering noise.
Greek hairdresser Mr. Bill loannou
had wigs stolen from his premises in
suburban Marrickville and Ashfield. His
wife said this week: “We used to make
terrific business with wigs, but now, for
two weeks, nothing, because we haven’t
any in the windows. The insurance
man was here yesterday and he said we
could have as many in the windows
during the day as we like, but not at
night. I asked for six or eight, but he
said no. It’s no good. People who walk
up and down at night and see wigs
often decided to buy. I’ll have to try
another insurance company.”
Exquisite Accessories Ltd., which,
according to 30-year-old managing
director Barry Wright, import about
200,000 wigs from Hong Kong annually,
has been hit four times —and hardest. In
February, 500 wigs (retail price $35 to
S4O) were stolen from the Hurlstone

AT ALL LEADING MEN’S STORES
Park premises where the company
“styles” the imports. Next it was the
warehouse in Lansvale. The haul: 1000
wigs. Then, one of the company’s
salons in Bankstown Square and finally
in Parramatta.
Where do the wigs go? What woman
will buy a wig sight (or herself in it)
unseen?
“They get rid of them cheaply at
some hairdressers’, I suppose, and at
wig parties,” said Mr. Wright.
Wig parties? “Yes, they’re like
Tupperware parties. We arrange them
ourselves where enough women get
together for a demonstration at home or
in a hall.” Mr. Wright’s answer to the
wig-snatchers has been to reinforce
strong-rooms at the factory and ware-
house and to connect alarms at all the

stations.
Bird-smuggling is an entirely different
lesser-felons’ operation, its stealth and
high risk for big gain having somewhat
ludicrous overtones of gold- and drug-
smuggling. It is mainly a Customs
problem and Mr. J. G. Gallagher,
Assistant Collector of Customs (Port
Services), said: “We know this
smuggling is going on and we catch up
with the culprits from time to time. We
see advertisements in overseas news-
papers offering Australian birds for
sale.”
He said that stethoscopes on order
were standard industrial equipment
which could easily be adapted for
Customs work They would not be used,
as someone had suggested, to listen to
heartbeats but to pick up scratching
noises. He did not think smugglers
needed to dope birds, because they
did not chirp in darkness.
Customs officers have found birds in
special suitcases false bottoms are
the most common —in travellers’ over-
coat pockets, even, according to one
report, inside a box Brownie camera—
a case of looking not at, but for the
dickie-bird.
Mr. A. Whelpton, general manager
of Toy Fisheries, a major bird and
pet supplier, put the smugglers’ incen-
tives into dollars and cents. Finches,
especially the multi-colored Star and the
Emblem, command from SIOO to SSOO
a pair, and are wanted for breeding.
Mr. • Whelpton said Holland is the
big centre for international bird-
smuggling. There are people there who
have built up a reputation for being
able to supply what is wanted, no
questions asked.
He said the smugglers cut birds’
wings to make them smaller. The wings
usually grow back in three or four
months, but sometimes not until next
season.
For the bird-fancying equivalent of
a Rubens or Titian collector, the
greatest object of his heart’s desire is
a golden-shouldered parrot, a bird no
bigger than a galah, found around Alice
Springs and farther north, and exceed-
ingly rare even there. Its price in inter-
national currency: S3OOO.

Wallace —the dark side
of the American dream
Third-party candidate Wallace.. . providing vengeance for the middle class
IT IS ALMOST a year since former
Governor George Wallace of Alabama
set out on his “impossible mission” of
getting his American Independent
Party on the Presidential ballot in every
State of the nation. His success brings
about what no third-party candidate
has managed since the days of Teddy
Roosevelt and his “Bull Moose” move-
ment in 1912: this year, for the first
time in more than half a century, the
contest for Presidency will lie not
between two men but instead a genuine
three-way choice across the length and
breadth of the country.
To look at, George Corley Wallace —
he has taken to using his second initial
though never the name seems an
improbable figure to have performed
such a miracle. He is undersized,
unimpressive, and unimposing, a
curious clockwork figure who walks
jerkily across the tarmac of airports
much in the same manner of those
staccato men in early newsreel films.
Throughout the daily city-hopping
flights on his old, beat-up chartered
DC-7, he sits in the front right-hand
seat next to the pilot’s cabin gazing
stonily out of the window and rarely
save briefly on his ritual trip to the
lavatory before each stop passing a
word with any of the 50-and-more
reporters who now regularly cover his
campaign.
For months now this aeroplane has
been his world, and its atmosphere is
like nothing that has ever been seen
before in American electioneering.
There are no drinks, no meals, not
even any stewardesses: its sole conces-
sion to convenience (if not comfort)
is a large cardboard box that is pushed
down the aisle just before each landing
and into which cigarette packs, dis-
carded bits of paper, and chocolate
wrappings are supposed to be thrown.
The only typewriters that clack away
are those of the working Press.
Advance speeches, even accurate
schedules, are things unheard of in this
campaign. Instead there is just the
candidate, the secret service men, the
amateur Wallace schoolgirls from the
State’s high schools, and the strong-
arm boys drawn from the ranks of the
Alabama Highway Patrol their
number has diminished since the death
in May of his wife, Lurleen, who suc-
ceeded him as Governor.
In the end none of this matters, for
when Wallace mounts a platform he is
like a man come into his kingdom.
Ever since the days of Louisiana’s
“Kingfish” Huey Long, the threat of
the arrival of another demagogue to
rouse the rabble has been a perpetual
nightmare to liberal America. It is no
longer a nightmare: it is a reality. In
the essentially evangelical world of
America’s little people, Sinclair Lewis’
Elmer Gantry now rides again.
Wallace’s theme, appropriately, is sin
sin and violence. Only perhaps the
South, with its humid passion and its
lust for quick and final physical show-
downs, could have produced a poli-
tician quite like this.
George Wallace, still only 49, has
learned from all his predecessors and,
therefore, is more effective than any
of them. He has managed to add the
final dimension of bluster. Never mind
that virtually every battle he has fought
against the integration of Alabama
University, the registration of Negro
voters he has lost: at the end of it
all he has contrived to be standing
there, if not as the victor, then at least
INTERNATIONAL
as a man who has never accepted
defeat;
The times, of course, have aided him.
To the formerly forlorn cause of the
South he has managed to add the dis-
contents of the blue-collar workers in
the northern cities, to say nothing of
the frustrations of the rural white poor.
He thus stands today as the standard-
bearer and champion of all those who,
in his own recurring phrase, are “sick
and tired of being pushed around by
big government.”
And it has to be conceded that no
one is a greater master of the code
signals and the catchwords under which
the racial dialogue of America is now
conducted. He never mentions Negroes,
or even blacks: he talks solely of
“the bleeding hearts and sob sisters who
complain about the behaviour of the
police,” “the scummy anarchists on the
nation’s streets,” even “the ivy-league,
ivory-towered, guide-line writers who
couldn’t even park a bicycle but still
tell folks like you and me when we
should get up in the morning and go
to bed at night.”
Probably his most famous line, and
in a way his ’most revealing, is: “And
let me tell you that if any anarchists
or demonstrators lie down in front of
my car when I’m President that’ll be
the last car they ever lie down in front
of.” It appears in every speech and it
never fails to raise the roof: it is almost
as if it were answering a need in the
nature of his audiences —and, in a way,
no doubt, it does.
Having aspired for years to what
they believe is the middle-class way of
life, those who make up Wallace’s con-
stituency of bitterness and disenchant-
ment have suddenly seen that way of
life being derided and rejected by many
among the young who already enjoy it.
To the’m it is the final insult, the ulti-
mate betrayal. It demands a kind of
personal vengeance, and George Wal-
lace provides it.
In fact, he goes out of his way to do
so. It is not just the demonstrators
and his car —it is the Vietnam student
protesters whom he is going “to grab
by their long hair and put in a good
Federal jail,” “the perfessors (sic) on
the campuses” who his Attorney-
General is going to arrest and indict
for treason within a week of taking
office. Behind it all is the suggestion
not of reason but of violence. And it
is that (though most of his hearers have
heard every single threat of his before
from their television sets) that keeps
his audiences on the edge of their seats
waiting for the tingling thrill of the
lines that they know are going to come.
Does Wallace hi’mself, then, carry an
air of menace and threat around with
him? The easy, the plausible explana-
tion would be that he does. But the
impossible, almost the incredible,
answer is that he is in himself a rather
engaging figure (if he stares out of the


window while sitting in his plane it is
not because he is sultry and lowering
but rather because he is simply scared
of flying), he is a man of hidden
insecurities and secret vulnerabilities, as
anyone interviewing him soon discovers.
He cannot bear the fact that people
poke fun at him. He would explain his
hostile, wary reaction to the Press
(though a lot of reporters, despite
themselves, quite like hi'm) in terms of
a striking personal sensitivity. “ ‘Time’
magazine,” he will explain almost petu-
lantly, “said I picked my teeth with a
soiled toothpick—well, you’ve eaten
with me and you know I don’t. And
then ‘Newsweek’ said I ate with a suck-
ing sound—can you hear any sucking
sound?” And so the self-pitying,
pathetic chronicle goes on right down
to the point of being asked to observe
just how little tomato ketchup he really
puts on his plate. Everywhere the
placards greet him, “If you like Hitler,
you’ll love Wallace,” but he doesn’t fit
at all easily into the prototype of a
national ogre.
“Governor,” a reporter can ask him,
“don’t you think those pickets and
hecklers probably help you?” “Yeah,
yeah,” he’ll reply, “ ’course they do.
That’s why we’ve got a whole load of
them travelling around with us> —what
do you think we’ve got that second
plane for?”—and he gives his self-
gratified snigger that for a moment
makes him look once again not like a
sinister threat to the republic but a
small courthouse politician having a
whale of a time showing off in the
local saloon.
To gain his present eminence as the
overthrower of the nation’s traditional
political system, Wallace has, of course,
come a long way. Born in Barbour
County, Alabama, as one of the three
sons of a ne’er-do-well farmer and a
gentle southern music-teacher, he has
had to fight for everything he has got —
even his wedding celebration was a
chicken-salad sandwich shared with his
late wife and her mother in the local
drugstore.
He is not, in fact, a Right-wing con-
servative at all, a truth that took some
time to dawn on the ranks of the
anachronistic reactionaries of 'America.
But now that it has it has earned him
their undying animosity. Take away
the race issue—and Wallace himself
came to it when a decade ago after his
only electoral defeat he all too candidly
commented: “I was out-nigguhed and,
boy, no one’s to out-nigguh me agin”—
and he looks indeed like a radical
figure. He started off in Alabama
politics as the champion of the “lunch
pailer” and the working man, and in
most ways he has remained a tribune
of the people ever since.
How well, then, will he do this Nov-
ember? In a sense the question is irrele-
vant, for regardless of the States he
carries and despite all the current
anguish and alarm they could well turn
out, eventually, to be only the tradi-
tional five of the Deep South—George
Wallace today, undoubtedly, represents
a force that any American President
from now on is going to have to reckon
with.
What the Republicans and the
Democrats have always tried to show
the nation is the bright side of the
American dream. It is George Wallace’s
singular achievement to have made
visible—and powerful, too—the dark
side of that same dream. For decent,
high-minded Americans, having to wit-
ness his success may not be an agree-
able experience but it could in the end
prove to be a salutary one.

ernment. But now they are again begin-
ning to look politically relevant and
respectable. The reasons for this are
not directly of their own making. They
stem from the formation of a less dog-
matic Government under Mr. Tran
Van Huong (and the subsequent decline
in the fortunes of Vice-President Ky
and his northern war-hawks) and from
the growing feeling in Vietnam that
sooner rather than later a political
settlement will end the war.
The closer the approach to serious
negotiations, the more pressing it
becomes for the Saigon Government to
secure militant Buddhist support. The
An Quang commands one of the most
important groups in the country, par-
ticularly in central Vietnam. But it is
still questionable whether the An Quang
line on peace and negotiations is recon-
cilable with the Government’s. The
Buddhists’ public political pronounce-
ments are deliberately obscure. They
want peace (and by implication, though
such specifics are not discussed, all
bombing should be' stopped if this is
the way to peace); they want a neutral
Moderate Buddhist leader Thich
Tam Chau (top) and Thich Thien
Hoa, who leads the newly active
militants
Vietnam independent of American in-
fluence. Behind these demands is the
confidence that a government which
achieved all this would be strong
enough to defeat the Communists
politically.
The militant Buddhists insist that
theirs is an anti-Communist policy.
They point out that the Government
has never pursued any of the charges of
collaboration with the Viet Cong that
were hurled at some of their leaders
during the panic of the Tet offensive.
But some of the views they express
privately are not all that different from
the program of the Viet Cong’s new
political front, the National Alliance
of Democratic and Peace Forces.
South Vietnam’s Buddhists split two
years ago into “militant” and “moder-
ate” factions, the militant faction being
much the larger. Buddhist statistics
have none of the precision achieved
by Vietnamese Catholics. But the bulk
of the support for the moderate leader,
Thich Tam Chau, comes from the
200,000 northern Buddhists and their
monks who emigrated to the south in
1954, and who are in a small minority
among the indigenous southern and
central Vietnamese Buddhists. Thich
Tam Chau is also supported by various
other sects, including some loosely dis-
ciplined groups in the south, and a sect
of Cambodian descent which follows
its own specialised policy of opposing
Prince Sihanouk.
The militants have as their spiritual
chief an elderly monk, Thich Tinh
Khiet, who has long held authority
among Buddhists in general. The
secular side of their activities is con-
trolled by the Vien Hoa Dao (Institute
for Secular Affairs) under Thich
Thien Hoa, a monk from the south
who may help the An Quang increase
its hitherto patchy following outside
central Vietnam. The well-known
militant leader Thich Tri Quang
holds no official position, but few people
doubt that he is still the driving force
in the An Quang. None of his
lieutenants has yet managed to match
his aura of mystery and command.
The Government hopes that the mili-


tant and moderate Buddhists will settle
their differences, and their claims to
leadership of the Unified Buddhist
Church, without Government interfer-
ence in favor of either side. But the
Government’s position is complicated
by a charter which President Thieu
signed last year giving official recogni-
tion to the moderates. The militants
demand that this should now be
rescinded and say there is no chance of
their supporting the Government until
it is. In July the militants held a
meeting which they claimed was an
official session of the Unified Buddhist
Church, and at which they elected a
supreme monk and other officers.
The moderates, led by Thich Tam
Chau, earned their name by arguing
that the clergy should stay out of
politics unless their religion is actually
threatened—as it was by the regime
of President Diem. Although many
educated lay Buddhists fully agree
with this, Tam Chau’s position has been
weakened by his almost blanket
approval of all Government actions,
even when these were directed against
other monks. And the younger northern
monks, who may well take over the
moderate movement from Tam Chau,
are considerably more pro-war and
anti-Communist than the “militants.”
MALAYSIA
SUCCESS AND SUCCESSION
From HARVEY STOCKWIN
THE MALAYSIAN Prime Minister,
Tunku Abdul Rahman, announced last
weekend that, as in times past, he will
be leaving office to better fight next
year’s election campaign. The Tunku
first did this before the 1959 election
campaign.
Freed from the chores of the Prime
Ministership, he is the better able not
only to conduct the campaign but to
help determine the course of the intra-
Alliance manoeuvring which precedes
it. Since next year, as on earlier occa-
sions, there would appear no danger of
the Alliance going down to defeat, as of
now the main interest in the elections
is whether or not the Alliance can
retain its two-thirds majority in Par-
liament, which makes constitution-
changing a possible cure for crises.
So moves within the Alliance are almost
as important as the election itself.
As the Tunku put it last weekend,
addressing the annual Party conference
of UMNO (the United Malay
Nationalist Organisation), “every time
we face the election we have a problem
on our hands because of the scramble
for seats . . . there are some who have
been members for some time and
would want to be nominated again
because of the prestige they enjoy and
the benefits they derive. On the other
hand there are others who want to be
selected because they have worked
hard for the Party . . . this is the crisis
we have to face at all levels . . . some-
times if we choose the wrong candidate
Rahman...facing his last election?
the discontented elements withdraw
from the Party to fight us as indepen-
dent candidates or join other opposi-
tion Parties or else try to sabotage
their own Party ... we have also to
consider the division of seats as between
the MCA (Malayan-Chinese Associa-
tion) and MIC (Malayan-Indian Con-
gress). This is a matter which presents
no difficulty and we have been able so
far to agree on the allotment of seats.”
Only in this last instance was this
otherwise frankly revealing passage on
the working of Malaysian political pro-
cesses less than frank. The allocation
of seats, like the allocation or non-
allocation of Ministries, has given rise
to some passionate rows. The Tunku’s
role in seeing that ultimately there was
“no difficulty” has been very consider-
able, but, even so, on at least one
occasion the allocation of seats threat-
ened to break up the Alliance itself.
The other question which presents
itself to many is whether or not having
won the election the Tunku will
reassume the premiership.
At the UMNO conference he had
nothing new to say about his retirement,
although he did ask the assembled dele-
gates “not to worry much if anything
were to happen to me” since “I am
getting on in years- and I am not as
fit and strong as I used to be.” “We
have leaders ready to fill my place,”
asserted the Tunku, referring only jest-
fully to one (meaning Tun Abdul
Razak) “who may appear to be bald-
ing, but, as the saying goes, ‘men with
little hair are very virile.’ ”
Perhaps the UMNO assembly pro-
vided a clue to whether or not the
election will see the Tunku’s retire-
ment. None of the senior posts in the
Party heirarchy was contested on this
occasion, particularly the three vice-
presidentships. The seniormost of
these will presumably become Deputy
Prime Minister when Razak becomes
Prime Minister. At present Minister
without Portfolio Senator Abdul
Ghafar bin Baba is the leading con-
tender in the sense that in the vice-
presidential stakes he obtained the
largest number of votes last year. On
the other hand, many would regard
Minister of Education Mohammed Khir
Johari (the second Vice-President) as
the more likely replacement for Razak.
It would seem that if the Tunku’s
ultimate retirement had been considered
to be pending there would almost cer-
tainly have been a vice-presidential
battle this year.
NEW ZEALAND
MISSION TO WASHINGTON
From ANTHONY HAAS
NEW ZEALAND’S Prime Minister,
Mr. Holyoake, will make his pilgrim-
age to Washington next month, but he
is unlikely to gather much more
wisdom, in the last months of the
Presidential campaign, than Australia’s
Mr. Gorton did. a few months ago.
Mr. Holyoake will talk with Presi-
dent Johnson and try to meet the
Presidential candidates Hubert
Humphrey and Richard Nixon. He
will deliver an address to the United
Nations General Assembly on October
14 and attend the Ministerial sessions
of the Colombo Plan in Seoul, South
Korea, later in the month.
Mr. Holyoake hopes to discuss with
President Johnson the progress and
prospects of the Paris peace talks as
well as the Czech crisis. His fellow-
countrymen may be more immediately
concerned about whether he can suc-
ceed in reducing the restrictions on
New Zealand meat exports to the
United States. The day after Mr.
Holyoake announced his trip, New
Zealand found she had to suspend
several months’ meat exports to keep
within the quota imposed to satisfy the
American meat lobby.
New Zealand has been nearly a year
without permanent ambassadorial
representation at the United Nations.
Although this is likely to be remedied
after Mr. Holyoake’s visit, it is a sign
Holyoak e...an American pilgrimage


of the passing of the passionate
enthusiasm for the organisation which
New Zealand’s post-war Labor Prime
Minister Peter Fraser had.
In the unlikely event that Mr. Holy-
oake learns a great deal from his tripi
that others could not know, he may be
interested in prodding Australia into
clarifying her intentions in Asia.
Although some New Zealanders will
not be too happy to act with Australia
when she makes up her mind, the New
Zealand Government is unlikely to act
without the ally who has been with her
in the British- and American-oriented
phases of her foreign policy.
CUBA
WAITING FOR MANANA
CASTRO’S CUBA, which will be cele-
brating the tenth anniversary of its
revolution next January, has evolved
its own curious brand of Communism.
The twin pillars are Maoism and
manana: American “imperialism” and
the capitalist system are attacked root
and branch; the jam that a hard-
working revolutionary people might
expect today is promised always for
tomorrow.
Without doubt the very poor are
better off than they were under the
Batista regime. Free medical attention;
compulsory free education from kinder-
garten to university; new houses not
impressive structurally, but clean and
neat all give the rural poor a better
standard of living. The new houses are
scattered in small penny packets in
communities specially selected for
growth or rebirth. Investment has been
poured into the construction of new
schools, new factories, dams, and the
agricultural program. But life, par-
ticularly in the towns, is very grey.
Nationalism has spread down to the
barbers’ shops. Private commerce is for-
bidden. Last April all the bars on the
island were closed. The official reasons
were that they took people’s minds away
from the work of building a Communist
Cuba, and also that they were centres
of counter-revolutionary activity. The
Cubans have taken this decision hard. It
is still possible to get a drink by order-
ing a meal at a restaurant, but all prices
are high—at least as expensive as New
York.
Eating out at restaurants is the only
way to supplement the rather meagre
rations of food available to the Cubans.
Meat, eggs, rice, beans, milk, and bread
are rationed. So are clothes and soap.
Commodities not rationed are so scarce
(matches and razor blades, for instance)
that rationing is imposed by queuing.
Queues, in fact, are the most striking
aspect of Cuban urban living.
The Maoism, of Cuban Communism
also appears in the Castro personality
cult. Dr. Fidel Castro combines the roles
of saviour, father-figure, and captain-
general. Fie works very hard —about 16
hours a day—partly at his desk, but
more often out in the fields, or visiting
tactories, schools, hospitals. “Fidel”
rallies the people wherever he goes.
There is little doubt that in the rural
areas, and among the poor, he has the
people’s full confidence.
In the towns, among technicians, one
can detect the fugitive wish that he
would spend less time telling the
experts their jobs, and refrain from
tying them to unrealistic production
figures. Much is heard of the planned
target of ten million tons of sugar by
1970. This would represent a doubling
of production in ten years.
For foodstuffs and consumer goods,
the Cuban people are forced to live on
promises rather than the fruits of
socialist planning. This is the manana
of Cuban Communism, and the Gov-
ernment is capitalising on the Latin
temperament perhaps even more than
it realises. When one asks when things
will get better, the answer is that the
Cuban economy must first be recon-
structed on socialist lines. The agri-
cultural reforms, the dams, the new
crops, and the new schools must be
completed before consumer goods are
Castro...16-hour day for the revolution
either imported or manufactured in
Cuba.
In the meantime, the Cuban economy
has run into what could be called a
spare-parts crisis. Probably about 90
percent of the consumer goods and
capital goods on the island are of pre-
-1958 American manufacture. The trade
embargo has had drastic effects. Cars,
typewriters, air-conditioners, the lifts in
the hotels, telephones all the hard-
ware which allows a modern economy
in a hot, humid climate to get through
its working day—are now beginning to
stall. Cuban taxi-drivers with their
battered 1958 Buicks do marvels of
tinkering.
The Cuban Government pays
promptly for any capital goods it
imports; in this respect it is an excel-
lent customer. The question is whether,
or when, it can afford to buy those
goods which, after ten years of
patience, the Cuban people surely have
the right to expect. When this ques-
tion was pressed on an official, he
replied guardedly that after 1971 or
1972 things would begin to get better.
But 1978 would be a more realistic
estimate. Whether by then the
manana, on which the Government so
clearly relies, will still be sustained, or
whether in 1978, as in 1968, the longest
queues in the country are formed by
those desperate to leave, remain open
questions.
SCIENCE
BOYS BEFORE GIRLS
GIVING COUPLES the chance to
choose the sex of unborn children, which
many scientists believe could be possible
quite soon, might have highly undesir-
able social consequences, according to
Professor Amitai Etzioni, a Professor of
Sociology at Columbia University, New
York.
Surveys indicate that in the United
States the immediate result of giving
couples a choice would be more boys—
probably a surplus over girls of more
than 300,000 a year.
The effects are difficult to foresee.
But Professor Etzioni notes in the cur-
rent issue of “Science” that women
read more books, see more plays, attend
church more often, and tend to be
charged with the moral education of
their children. Men, by contrast, are
responsible for much more crime.
So' sex control might “produce a
society with some of the rougher
features of a frontier town.” There
would be fewer women to give moral
education and more men to commit
crime. This would “magnify social prob-
lems which are already overburdening
our society.” There might also be
increases in prostitution, homosexuality,
and distress among bachelors unable to
find partners.
Why Americans prefer boys is
obscure, but may be deep-rooted and
difficult to shift. It has been argued
that mothers want boys to substitute
for their fathers, while fathers believe
boys can more easily achieve “success.”
In sum, Professor Etzioni says, the
distress brought by sex control is likely
to outweigh substantially the pleasures
of parents in having a choice (which
seems a very small joy, he says, “com-
pared to the sorrows of the unmatable
mates”).
Should research on sex control there-
fore be controlled or banned? Western
civilisation, Professor Etzioni says, has
hitherto assumed that such control
would mean the end of technological
progress and free inquiry. On the other
hand, society accepts control of various
damaging activities, such as the use of
human subjects for research, and pro-
ducts such as dangerous drugs.
At least the problem must be faced,
Professor Etzioni concludes, since accel-
erating technology may “overload
society’s capacity to adapt” and thus
cause “more unhappiness than any
group of men has a right to inflict on
others, however noble their intentions.”


THE WEEK IN AMERICA
THE CHICAGO DEBATE
A FILM which might be titled “Dick
Daley Strikes Back” was shown on 55
American TV stations last Sunday
evening. This hour-long documentary
had been put together by members of
Mayor Daley’s publicity staff in answer
to the world-wide protest against the
Chicago Police Department’s tactics in
suppressing youthful dissenters during
the Democratic Convention last month.
The film contained footage from police
photographers and private individuals
reportedly showing how police had been
provoked by the demonstrators as well
as interviews with injured police and
newsmen.
Although the vast majority of Ameri-
can and foreign news media had con-
demned Mayor Daley and his police,
voices expressing support for their
actions during the convention were
beginning to be heard.
Betty Beale, columnist for the
“Washington Star,” wrote: “Never has
a law-enforcing group been more sorely
tried than the Chicago police. They
received both bodily injury and un-
speakably vile treatment from hippies
in Grant Park. Yet never at any time
did I see policemen show more courtesy
than the police of Chicago. And, despite
the difficult circumstances in which
they had to maintain order, they man-
aged to prevent fatal catastrophe.”
Senator Daniel Inouye, of Hawaii,
war hero and Democratic keynoter, said
the hippies were throwing plastic bags
of human excrement at the police and
guards in Grant Park. They were also
throwing rubber balls stuck with long
nails aimed for the eyes.
Washington columnist James Kil-
patrick contended that the hippies and
yippies were not revolutionaries in the
usual sense “but, at bottom, nihilists
dedicated to destruction for the sake of
destruction.”
“In their disregard for the rights of
A red flag, hippies, and yippies ...the
Chicago story is changing
other Americans, they are as ugly and
evil as any gangster mob,” Kilpatrick
added. “Hour after hour they stood in
the parks shouting obscenities at the
police a few feet away. They had a
chant going, ‘Pig, pig, fascist pig.’
Their taunting of police never ceased.
Grant Park is —or was a pleasant
little park. They made it a shambles.
They tumbled into blankets just off
the walkways making love, not war.
They urinated against the Park’s back
wall. They scrawled their four-letter
words on benches, lamp-posts, and barri-
cades. Their one purpose was to pro-
voke violence. At last they succeeded.”
MICE AND MEN
MICE crammed into small boxes can
be driven to attack each other as
already do human beings crowded into
one of the densest downtown areas of
the world, New York’s Wall Street
financial district.
The Ford Foundation has endowed
a study of “the street” to determine
“whether crowding . may impose on
human beings comparable psychological
or physiological stress.”
About 450,000 persons each day pour
into a patch of Manhattan scarcely
two-thirds of a square mile in size.
Already today Wall Streeters arriving
for work have to push their way
through waves of humanity pouring out
of dark subway tunnels into thronged
streets. They queue just to pick up a
cup of coffee to take to the office.
At midday, the wait for lunch at a
restaurant takes a minimum of half an
hour. Once seatgd, customers are
rushed beyond endurance. A brusque
waiter at one restaurant growls: “I’ll
give you a martini and lunch and have
you out of here in 12 minutes flat.”
One way to avoid the crush is to buy
a frankfurter from a pushcart vendor
and eat it in the street flavored with
exhaust fumes from the jammed-up
trucks and cars.
A bookstall on Broad Street, in the
centre of the crowded area, displays a
sign: “No browsing from 12 to 2 p.m.”
At certain hours the telephone cables
are so overloaded that it’s impossible
to put a call through or receive calls.
There is only one tranquil enclave
Trinity churchyard, at the head of Wall
Street, where the bones of Alexander
Hamilton, the first U.S. Secretary of
the Treasury, rest — for the nonce
in peace.
BITING THE DOG
AMERICAN journalists don’t always
wait for man to bite dog they
go and bite the dog themselves to
make the news.
An important Bill due for passage in
the U.S. Congress this week was drawn
up, prompted and lobbied through the
legislative mills by Sanford (Whitey)
Watzman, a Washington correspon-
dent for the Cleveland “Plain Dealer.”
Known informally as the “Whitey Watz-
man Law,” it is a measure authorising
the Pentagon to check contractors’ books
for possible overcharges on about $5OOO
million of defence contracts not put out
for competitive tenders.
In Washington, the practice of not
only getting it fi'om the horse’s mouth
but being inside his mouth has become
almost a way of life for enterprising
reporters covering the nation’s capital.
Offstage, newsmen are on occasion the
principal promoters of a headlined Con-
gressional hearing and other events they
chronicle presumably with detach-
ment.
Congressmen usually welcome the
newsmen’s involvement because it
guarantees them good Press coverage
in their home districts.
Prizewinning reporter Clark Mol-
lenhoff of the Washington Press corps-
has been trying to drum up a Congres-
sional investigation of the Apollo moon-
landing program. So far he has failed.
Some editors view the new trend of
“dog-biting reporters” with grave reser-
vations. Several have suggested that
reporters who get involved take leave
of absence to further their crusades —
or, better yet, run for Congress. But most
of the trade applaud the journalistic
initiative, praising their colleagues as
“lobbyists for the public interest.”
FABLE OF FACT
THE university town of Wellesley,
Massachusetts, has been split by an
obscenity court case revealing the deep
anxieties in the community over the
race and youth rebellions in America.
Two Wellesley High School teachers
and a town resident have been charged
with introducing obscene matter into
the school and face punishment of five
years’ imprisonment, plus $5OOO fine if
found guilty.
The charge arose from a high-school
stage presentation, approved by the
defendants, of a ten-minute segment of
“The Slave,” a violent “fable” of a future
time when American Negroes and
whites are at war in the streets. “The
Slave” was written by Le Roi Jones,
one of America’s most militant black
activists, and is studded with four-letter
words. When the words echoed through
the high-school gymnasim, where the
play was staged before students,
teachers, and some townspeople walked
out. Later, police arrested the teachers
who had staged the production on com-
plaint of parents. At a protest hearing
in the same auditorium a teacher
attempted to read the offending
passage from the play, but parents
staged a riotous scene, yelling, “Kill
him! Get him out of here! Get him!”
The passionate reaction to the play
was linked to some townsfolk who bit-
terly oppose the town’s recent decision
to bring black pupils from neighboring
towns by bus into Wellesley schools.
Wellesley, wealthiest community in the
State, has 26,000 residents but only 13
Negro families. Many residents fear the
busloads will cause the community to
be “inundated” by Negroes.


Czech fallout in Asia
South Koreans denounce Russia and burn its flag
Outside the Russian trade mission in Singapore
By HARVEY STOCKWIN
“YOU HAVE dispatched hundreds of
thousands of troops to occupy the whole
of Czechoslovakia; what ‘territorial
integrity’ is there to speak of? You
brought Czechoslovak Party and
Government bosses to Moscow and
created puppets with the help of your
bayonets. What else is this, if not ‘inter-
ference in internal affairs’? Your tanks
run amok in Prague and your aggressor
troops shoot to kill the Czechoslovak
people at will. Can there be ‘friendship,’
‘solidarity’ in the world?”
“In the present situation the imme-
diate need is for the withdrawal of
forces which have entered Czecho-
slovakia so that Czechoslovak people
may be free to determine their own
future for themselves without any inter-
vention and in an atmosphere which is
free from tension. Whatever problems
there may be between Czechoslovakia
and its neighbors should be settled
peacefully by means of negotiations
and not through the use of force. The
processes of peaceful co-existence which
we have tried to promote for so many
years must be allowed to develop
unimpeded.”
Is the first quotation some irate
South-East Asian statesman making up
for all the time lost in contemplation
of the thought that there are “good”
and “bad” Communists, the good mean-
ing what they say and the bad never
saying what they mean?
Is the second one some miserable
in-between Communist Party anxiously
balancing the fact their country wants
to go its own way with the fact that
Moscow alone provides those oh-so-
comfortable free trips to distant places?
In point of fact, the first is from an
article in the “Chinese Peoples’ Daily,”
in which for a brief moment the writer
departed from orthodox fulminations
against the “Soviet revisionist renegade
clique.” The second quotation is from
Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, which
India’s representative at the United
Nations paid the compliment of repeat-
ing at the Council.
The writer in the “Chinese Peoples’
Daily” asserted that the Czech-Russian
“talks” in Moscow were the “outcome
of the pressure exerted by U.S. im-
perialism on the Soviet revisionists and
of intensified U.S.-Soviet counter-
revolutionary global collusion.” The
author condemned the Russian use of
such phrases as “territorial integrity,”
“non-interference in internal affairs,”
“friendship,” and “solidarity” as “the
height of shamelessness.”
There is just a chance that amid
all the cliches and stereotypes that this
Czech crisis called forth, not only in
Peking but everywhere, the Chinese
writer really cared for the Czechs and
for the principles that were being
bayoneted.
However that might be, there can be
little doubt that his Peking masters
made more prosaic calculations when
determining their stand on the whole
issue. While Peking had little empathy
with Dubcek and co.mpany, it had
absolutely none for the “imperialist and
Fascist” methods of the Russians.
What made China take this line, and
what has she gained as a result?
Assuming that anti-Russian pique wasn’t
the sole reason, the distinct possibility
exists that China’s fears of Russia
played their part. The world, after all,
is well aware of Russia’s fears of China,
and used to talking about China as the
up-and-coming super power. The
Chinese are probably not so unmindful
of their military and other weaknesses
which leave them as yet incapable of
wholly ruling out Russian intervention
«f some kind or another in their
internal affairs or in what they regard
as their sphere of influence. Russian
Asia almost certainly figures in their
calculations more than anywhere else.
Supposing, for example, a North
Korean Dubcek made Moscow think
that tanks were once again the answer?
The greatest single advantage for
Peking is the fact that their line of
attacking Russia has been that of the
overwhelming majority of Co,mmunist
Parties throughout the world. This
considerably diminishes Russian influ-
ence over what is fast ceasing to be
an international movement.
It is incredible that in their myopia
the Russians completely failed to calcu-
late that their influence in Asia and else-
where, and their Communist hegemony
in relation to China, would have been
far better served by allowing their
Czech allies to have their Bratislava-
and-Cierna way. After all, if a nation
of eight million square miles cannot
feel secure because of a few extra
square miles called Czechoslovakia, who
can?
The only time China was widely
condemned for “aggression” was, of
course, when she invaded India in 1962
though in this regard it would be-
as well to remember that for Peking
the disputed Akasi Chin area has
strategic and security implications, not
least in relation to Russia. But on that
occasion, unlike the Russians, the
Chinese at least emerged with some dip-
lomatic pluses especially when, having
made their point, they unilaterally
withdrew, leaving Indian foreign policy
and prestige in a shambles.
It’s still a shambles, as India’s show-
ing at the Security Council on the
Czech invasion well demonstrated. The
pious hopes and irrelevant exhortations
that characterise India’s policy have
once more been offered. India has not
been able to bring about peaceful
co-existence with China through negoti-
ations and gives absolutely no sign
of intending to but still, what India
does herself is not what she expects or
demands others should do. While
aggression near India’s borders is always
something deserving condemnation,
especially if it is by Pakistan, somehow,
when one gets further afield, Indian
diplomacy always manages to find what
they consider a compelling reason for
not condemning.
The obvious reason why India could
not take a firm stand would first appear
to be the amount of aid Russia has
given her over the years. At second
glance, and bearing in mind that India
has been unhappy with Russian

attempts to improve relations with
Pakistan, it would seem that perhaps
the Indians were hoping Pakistan would
take the Chinese line, condemn, and
leave the Russians feeling that India
was their best ally. The wily Pakistanis
avoided this one by likewise abstain-
ing on the Security Council resolution,
having “not received instructions in
time,” thereby, unlike the Indians,
avoiding giving offence to anyone.
But whereas a similar failure by
India over Hungary brought forth
strong reactions, these have not been
forthcoming this time. The sad fact is
that the Chinese invasion, having dem-
onstrated the wide gap between Indian
words and reality, and the Indians
having done little, if anything, to close
it, no one really bothers about what
India says any longer. Which is under-
standable. The never-ending, never-
solved Indo-Pakistani cold war having
done so much to inhibit both countries’
independence, it seems irrelevant what
they say about the self-determination,
or absence of it, of others.
Just as the Philippines w'as edging
its way toward commencing trade and
diplomatic ties with Eastern Europe and
the Soviet Union, the Czech crisis sets
the tide back. Perhaps the anti-
Communism of the Philippines, although
still strong, is not so automatic as it
used to be. Certainly this was true in
the case of Malaysia. There Deputy
Prime Minister Tun Razak hastily
withdrew his initial condemnatory re-
action—a move w’hich made many
wonder whether Malaysia wasn’t feel-
ing more obliged to the Russian
presence than was strictly necessary.
This still left the Russian Embassy
in possession of a query from Moscow
on the Prime Minister Tunku Abdul
Rahman’s reaction which only one
Western agency had managed to garner.
In point of fact, the Tunku’s face, on
hearing the new's from Czechoslovakia,
revealed more than what he said. The
Malaysian Prime Minister had just
come out of Parliament after answering
a question on Malaysia’s foreign policy,
during which he made the customary
distinction ! betw r een Communists who
believe in peaceful co-existence and
those who don’t. “It all depends on the
the hammer and sickle are used,”
said the Tunku, “we can be friendly
with those Communist countries which
don’t use a hammer and sickle to break
our heads.” How' he felt a few minutes
later scarcely has to be described, but
almost certainly his old argument of
“once a Communist, always a Com-
munist” was to the fore in his mind.
More noteworthy, perhaps, is the fact
that both Indonesian and Malaysian
university students felt strongly enough
about the fate of the Czechs to demon-
strate outside their Russian Embassies.
At least in Indonesia they were free to
demonstrate, with the Russian Ambassa-
dor ultimately declining Foreign
Minister Adam Malik’s offer to pay
for the damage. Instead of making the
elementary calculation that Malaysia’s
future might be that much more secure
if their students did feel strongly about
questions of freedom, the Malaysian
riot squad let go with tear-gas at
students who weren’t even inclined to
inflict damage. The ultimate absurdity
came w'hen the riot squad turned out
in force again w'hen the students took
a petition to the Minister for Home
Affairs to protest over police behaviour.
This complete lack of imagination and
perspective might yet do the Alliance
Government considerable harm.
Japan has been the country w'ith the
strongest, widest, and most interesting
reactions. Not that the reason is far to
seek. The Russians are squatting on
territory the Japanese regard as their
own. It has been interesting to note
some Japanese commentators invoking
the Hitlerian Sudetenland - march
parallel on this occasion, rather as if the
Japanese have completely forgotten
whose side they were on in World War
ll—though some, of course, might use
this as tenuous evidence for Japan hav-
ing “completely reformed.”
More relevantly there is a closer his-
toric memory. In addition to the Hun-
garian and Berlin Wall incidents which
Japan remembers as a dutiful member
of the “free world,” there is the even
stronger memory of Russia’s belated
and cynical entry into World War II
which brought her sphere of influence
right down to a few miles off the
northern Japanese island of Hokkaido,
where she still occupies islands in the
continued absence of a Japanese-
Russian peace treaty.
Initially it was assumed that the
strong Japanese reaction to Russian
aggression would inevitably benefit the
Right-wing factions of the Liberal
Democratic Party which buttress the
Sato-Fukuda leadership. So it well may
be. LDP Secretary-General Fukuda has
twice recently declared that the Czech
affair should remind Japanese of the
necessity of the security treaty w'ith the
U.S. continuing past 1970. Those such
as Foreign Minister Miki, who might
have opposed Prime Minister Sato’s bid
for third term as Party President and
therefore Prime Minister, on the
ground, among others, that Japan
should be less anti-Communist, have
received a setback.
The Japanese Foreign Ministry’s cal-
culation that the Czech crisis would
slow down the progress of Vietnam
peace talks would seem to have one
eye on the economic implications for
Japan, and one on the thought that
the longer the Vietnam War continues
the more thrust the neutralists in
Japanese politics will be able to obtain.
In short, the Czech crisis has played a
small but significant part in what will
be a drawn-out but fateful contest —
between those who want Japan to play
orthodox power politics and those who
don’t.
The various reactions are interesting
in themselves, but they don’t help the
Czechs. Is it that after all the conscience
of the world is dead? Missing from
most of the reactions was any note of
sincere belief that there but for the
grace of the super Powers go I?

Canberra’s complex about culture
WHEN Mrs. Harold Holt did her
much-publicised redecoration of the
Prime Minister’s Lodge, among the
objects used was a collection of carved
emu-eggs which Mrs. Holt, it was then
reported, had obtained from the national
collection.
The item may have surprised. Some
people may have been unaware that
there was a national collection of carved
emu-eggs. Others may have been dis-
mayed that there was such a haphazard
attitude toward national ■ treasures that
items could be obtained to decorate an
official, but private, house. One can
think of Charles de Gaulle taking the
Mona Lisa, one cannot think of him
obtaining it. The emu-eggs also rein-
forced the feeling that there is still
something of the informality of a big
country town about Canberra; anyone
can nip across and borrow something
from a neighbor.
There are obvious disadvantages in
this attitude to keeping national collec-
tions. Anyone who, for example, was
doing a monograph on Folk Arts of
Australia would presumably have had
to knock on the door of the Lodge and
ask if he might inspect the national
collection of carved emu-eggs.
These days of informality are num-
bered. The National Library was
opened by the Prime Minister, Mr.
Gorton, last month. An architect for
the art gallery has been chosen and an
interim council, with Dame Zara Holt
as a member, appointed. Soon items in
the national collections will be as inviol-
able as the ersatz German camisoles
and knickers from World War I in the
Australian War Memorial.
With the proposed new parliament,
the library and art gallery are supposed
to form some sort of holy trinity,
although one should not assume that
their purposes represent any reliable
guide to Australians’ scale of values.
The fact that the library is finished, the
gallery planned, and the parliament
squabbled about strengthens the impres-
sion that they are really serious about
Canberra and that the people who have
until now been pottering about with
public servants’ drains or enthusiasti-
cally pulling out native trees to plant
exotics are about to build a city.
While politicians fight about whether
their parliament, which one may thank-
fully assume few of the present members
will ever sit in, should be on a hill or by
a lake, basic considerations seem to be
lost sight of.
Talk of “prestige” or “monumental”
buildings these days puts most people
depressingly in mind of nowhere as
much as Sukarno’s Djakarta. Is
Canberra still planning the sort of
capital the Americans, those Australians
of the nineteenth century, were talking
about more than 100 years ago and
which fortunately never came out
according to plan? It may be significant
that the parliamentary delegation which
inspected various unlikely parliamentary
buildings around the world did not go
to Brasilia; there they might have had
to engage their minds with more new
concepts and face more difficult
choices than how many lavatories there
should be for visitors.
Then there is the whole idea of
national this-and-that (leaving aside the
tautology of Australian national this-
and-that; does anyone think we might
be building the Ethiopian art gallery in
Canberra?). These days how much do
we need buildings to tell us who we
are? There are undoubtedly many Aus-
tralians whose patriotic hearts would
beat faster at the thought that every
school and shire in the country had a
decent library than at the news that
an $B-million national library had been
opened in Canberra.. There might be
even more who would feel more
proudly Australian if we were making
the largest contribution per capita to
underdeveloped countries than because
we are about to build a new parliament.
We must face the fact that to better-
educated, less simple future generations
the whole idea of strengthening the
nation’s fibre by “prestige” buildings
may seem laughable. What is more
important is that to build a once-more-
revived classical revival building on the
shores of an artificial lake and declare
that it will be 100 years before it is in
full use as a library and that it will last
500 years is to ignore every implication
of our age.
In the past cathedrals and tombs
tended to last well because their
purposes were unchanging. The library
in Canberra is already making extensive
use of modem methods, such as film,
tape, facsimile copying. Most of us may
like to believe that books as we know
them will be around in 100, even 500,
years, but we cannot pretend that
libraries will be much as they are now.
The average city building is now
planned to last about 20 years, not
because concrete and steel are frail but
because it is assumed that no one can
predict beyond that what sort of facili-
ties or environment people will want
beyond that time. Modem technology
does not rule out the possibility of
buildings which combine complex pur-
poses with the hope of lasting beauty
or interest, but, equally, modern tech-
nology does not promise that they will
be cheap. The Sydney Opera House is a
most eloquent proof of this.
But whether with, for example, the
new parliament we are going to try for
a building, such as the Sydney Opera
House, which may combine outstand-
ing beauty with complex purposes or
whether we will settle for something
relatively cheap and of shorter life is
a basic decision which Canberra seems
so far to be unaware exists. Without
this decision, $3O million pulled out of
the air by politicians for a new parlia-
ment is outrageous nonsense.
Even more basic are the difficulties
of Canberra itself. Putting a country’s
parliament down in a paddock doesn’t
matter much; there are some advan-
tages on both sides in keeping politicians
away from the electorate, but libraries
and galleries depend on a constant flow
of people. In the foreseeable future they
will not get this in Canberra; they may
never.
Canberra is now a town of 103,000
people, with about one in 120 of the
population, compared with Sydney and
Melbourne, which have almost one in


By PATRICIA ROLFE
six each. The constant figure dredged
up is that by 1980 Canberra will have a
population of 250,000. What is signifi-
cant is that no one will predict beyond
that. A quarter of a million, somewhat
less than rapidly growing Newcastle has
now, may virtually be its maximum.
To get to 250,000, there are still
some public servants to come from
Melbourne: Repatriation, Labor and
National Service, the PMG, and the
CSIRO. Once they are there Canberra
will have to rely on its own attractions
or the establishment of industry to
grow. Even the most optimistic Parkin-
sonian cannot expect a proliferating
public service to enable Canberra to
grow at the rate at which the BHP
enables Newcastle to grow. (BHP now
has more stockholders than Canberra
has people; that is development.)
Being where and what it is, Canberra
will probably continue to lose a large
proportion of people on retirement and
its children at maturity. Some of the
people who make the most enthusiastic
and expensive claims for Canberra are
those who react most strongly against
the idea that they are themselves
breeding public servants in Canberra or
that they might stay there after retire-
ment. Another matter is that almost no
ministers or members live in Canberra;
a national library, art gallery, or even
a new parliament will not make them.
Similarly, it is absurd to talk of public
buildings in Canberra as “tourist attrac-
tions.” A tourist attraction, to the trade,
is a place which will induce people to
spend a relatively long time there as
expensively as possible. Certainly bus-
loads of people, mostly on their way
somewhere else, will visit the library,
the art gallery, and the parliament, as
they now visit the war memorial, but it
is doubtful if many of them will buy
more than ice-creams or a meal at
Civic.
It is not entirely facetious to ask
whether it is not too late even now to
abandon Canberra. The site was chosen
before Australians en masse took to the
surf and to sail, we have few worries
now about naval bombardment, so an
inland city seems increasingly eccentric
and unattractive. The Federal port at
Jervis Bay has never been developed,
mainly because the air age came;
instead Canberra now has the most fre-
quently fogbound airport in the
country.
With some industries, such as elec-
tronics, Canberra could become our
first planned provincial city. The present
Parliament House could be the council
chambers. Decentralisation, at present
an irritating and perpetual absurdity,
could get some meaning. A new capital
could be built at Jervis Bay. With the
advantages of a milder climate and a
port, the population could grow much
more quickly and stay for life. Few of
Canberra’s mistakes need be repeated
and in a relatively short time the new
capital could outstrip the old.
Canberra people are, of course, aware
of the difficulties of their situation.
Regrettably, their solutions often seem
expensive to people who do not breathe
its rarefied air. For example, the
National Librarian, Mr. H. L. White,
has suggested a $500,000 home for what
he calls “unofficial scholars” near the
library, to be financed by public sub-
scription. Why the public, unless he
means exclusively the people of Can-
berra, would be willing to pay to make
up for the deficiencies of Canberra is
unclear, since as taxpayers they are
already paying for it. Why, too, Mr.
The $8 million National Library, built to outlast its usefulness
Prime Minister Gorton at the Chairman Sir Grenfell Price’ (l.)
opening in the main reading-room and tapestry designer M. Mategot
White believes that the centre would
become self-supporting is also unclear;
surely not from the royalties earned by
“unofficial scholars.”
Until Mr. White gets his centre for
“unofficial scholars,” the library may
function to a disturbingly large extent
as a 'branch of the academic industry,
with academics busy there researching
and writing books to go on its shelves,
there to lie unread until a new genera-
tion of academics moves in to begin
their research and writing, largely from
the books of their predecessors.
So good are facilities at Canberra
that some “official scholars” may have
a self-contained flat at the Australian
National University, a private study
within the university, and a private
room at the library. This would secure
almost complete insulation from the
community. Scholars from other
countries, who spend most of their time
in Canberra, could be forgiven if they
returned home unaware that in most
ways this is a backward country.
Although the library facilities are
lavish, in one respect a clever device
has saved money. This is the provision
of the Copyright Act, which compels
every publisher to furnish a free copy
of every book, pamphlet, or newspaper
published in Australia. This is a pro-
cedure known as compulsory acquisition
without compensation. This principle,
the prevalence of which does not make
it any more attractive, was not applied
elsewhere in the library, to the chair-
makers, marble-quarriers, or artists in
stained glass, but, as has often been
said, books are different.
Most of the 500,000 people a year
who, it is claimed, visit the Australian
War Memorial will spare some time
for the library, although probably not as


The War Memorial ...500,000 visitors
a year, mostly on their way somewhere
else
much as for the museum; there isn’t
as much to see. The average visitor,
spilling out of a Pioneer coach, would
probably stand and gape at the main
entrance, with its marble floors, impos-
ing Leonard French windows, and
Mategot tapestries, but might not feel
brave enough to mount the marble
steps, quarried from the same area
which furnished the marble for the
Parthenon; after all, one knows one’s
place.
The library services are impressive. Its
film collection is particularly notable.
The library’s concentration has in part
been in post-Federation matters and it
claims to be strong on aviation, trade
unionism, and politics. In 1923 it
acquired a notable collection of Captain
Cook manuscripts. It seems to ration-
alise its attitude to the State libraries
in the matter of acquisition of early
stuff in a rather baffling way. Cook- is
national, a librarian claimed, but we
would not bid, say, for the diaries of an
early Tasmanian settler; we think
Tasmania should have them. Batman?
Oh, yes, Batman might be considered
national. It seemed unwise to ask about
early New South Wales governors.
One assumes there are areas of co-
operation and areas of competition
between the national library and other
libraries in the country. However, the
national library could normally outbid
the States or universities if it chose,
but this is only part of the larger lunacy
of Commonwealth-State finances.
The Canberra-induced problems of
the art gallery are far greater than those
of the library. A gallery depends vitally
on constant use by interested people
artists and experts, the average viewer,
and the occasionally attracted other-
wise it is not a gallery. What will induce
people to go to Canberra to see art
above going to Melbourne for its new
gallery or Sydney for the private gal-
leries of Paddington? Nothing much in
the national collection so far and cer-
tainly not simply calling the building
the Australian National Art Gallery.
The national art collection at the
moment is about 2000 works, mostly
paintings, because there hasn’t been
anywhere to store sculpture. Some of
it is lent to Australian embassies, some
is in the Lodge, in the Prime Minister’s
department, in Government House,
Darwin, and in the Canberra Theatre.
When the gallery is finished it all comes
back and is ticked off on a list. The
rest is stored in racks in a building in
the suburb of Manuka.
Collecting is in the hands of the
Commonwealth Art Advisory Board.
The chairman, Sir Daryl Lindsay, is
also chairman of the interim council
for the new gallery. Mr. W. A. Dargie
is on the board and on the new council,
but the other three board members-,
Mr. Robert Campbell, Mr. Douglas
Pratt, and Mr. Russell Drysdale, are
not on the council. This means that
three of the people who have been
choosing pictures for the gallery have
no say in what it will be like.
The Art Advisory Board was set up
in 1911 to recommend who should paint
politicians and other public figures, and
has carried on from there.
The current members were appointed
in 1953, except Mr. Drysdale, appointed
1962. Although the present Prime
Minister, Mr. Gorton, has not exactly
made many sweeping changes, it is now
planned for the Art Advisory Board,
the Commonwealth Music Fund, and
the Commonwealth Literary Fund
members to retire at the end of a term;
this already applies to members of the
new Australian Council for the Arts.
Until now members were generally
there for life.
The board’s budget for 1968-69 was
$lOO,OOO compared with $4OOO for 1961.
Fifteen years ago any purchase above
$4OO had to be referred to the Prime
Minister, but the board has in recent
years had a fairly free hand. The col-
lection is of Australian painting only.
The committee of inquiry into the gal-
lery talked of acquiring Asian art and
“art of the twentieth century on a
world-wide basis.” However, few moves
have been made in these directions.
What is clear is that it will never have
the collection which Melbourne has, nor
Drama, centred in this theatre, gets a
lower subsidy than the Olympic pool
will it ever have anything like the col-
lection of Pacific and Aboriginal art and
objects which the Australian Museum
in Sydney has, and which, among other
things, ensures that the Australian
Museum remains th e Australian
Museum and no national about it. A
collection of New Guinea pieces, pre-
sented to the Commonwealth by Sir
Hubart Murray in 1920, is apparently
stored in the basement of the Institute
of Anatomy, but its scope or worth is
not generally known. Twenty thousand
dollars was set aside in this Budget for
a collection of Papua-New Guinea art.
What seems interesting is that the
Nan Kevill collection, which includes
many nineteenth - century Australian
paintings, and other collections, such as
Ellis Rowan’s 1000-odd flower drawings,
have been given to or acquired by the
Commonwealth and it is up to the
Government rather than one institution
to decide who shall have what. This
could create an interesting position
between the library and gallery when
the time comes. It is also suggested that
the Dobell paintings in the War
Museum were commissioned by the
Department of Works when Mr. Dobell
was with the Allied Works Council and
belong to the Commonwealth, so are at
the museum merely as a matter of
convenience.
Even in its prime field the national
collection has many gaps which at
current prices the board may well feel
disinclined to fill. The State galleries
have the best early Australian stuff and
most of the best of the Impressionists.
The board bought a Louis Buvelot for
$3500 at the Page Cooper auction in
Melbourne earlier this year but firmly
passed up the chance of a Streeton at
$20,000. The gaps in the 1940-50
period, at $34,000 for a Drysdale or
$32,000 for a Nolan, may remain.
The Commonwealth helps finance
tours throughout the country of major
exhibitions, such as the recent American
and Scandinavian ones, and at times
arranges for the presentation of Aus-
tralian art in other countries.
What is most disturbing about the
projected gallery is that until last week
it had absolutely no staff. The interim
council has been appointed, but a com-
mittee, as the Sydney Opera House
bears strong, incessant witness, is not
an ideal client. A former director of
the Houston, Texas, gallery, Mr. James
Sweeney, who came here for the open-
ing of the Melbourne gallery, is a con-
sultant, but there is no director. The
Prime Minister’s Department has twice
advertised for an “exhibitions officer.”
Last week Mr. James Mollison, for-
merly director of the Ballarat Gallery,
was appointed to this job.
Once you move away from the gallery
and the library you are out of the
oppressive national co’mplex. Canberra
then scales down to a small city, or
large town, with an enthusiastic branch
of the Arts Council and numerous
societies for various amateur pursuits
of the arts. It is arguable whether

Canberra, because of the people who
live there (this is generally put more
specifically as, “you know, the ANU
and so forth”), has a more lively life
in the arts than other places of its
size.
The Canberra Theatre has some
advantages over similar buildings in
other towns, but it is not essentially
different, except that it was built by
the taxpayers of the Commonwealth
rather than by the ratepayers of the
community; that is the Canberra story.
They cannot call it the national
theatre, because that would imply a
company installed there. On present
population, Canberra cannot support a
resident company, and may never be
large enough to do so comfortably.
The centre has two theatres and an
art gallery. The smaller theatre, the
Playhouse, is often used by the Can-
“Ethos” in City Square, but statues and
buildings don’t make community spirit
berra Repertory Theatre, an amateur
group of good standing with a profes-
sional producer. The art gallery is used
by commercial galleries from other
cities, such as Sydney’s Macquarie, but
does not function fully as a commercial
gallery. Canberra’s only substantial
private gallery is Mrs. Lesta O’Brien’s
sculpture gallery at Narrabundah. This
is supply meeting demand. The National
Capital Development Commission buys
or commissions a fair amount of sculp-
ture to fill Canberra’s open spaces, and,
in fact, can decide whether or not a
piece can be used outdoors.
Although it may not flatter the van-
ity of some Canberra people, the
theatre has become an out-of-town
try-out theatre for productions which
later go to the capital cities. Also,
with the Australian Ballet and Eliza-
bethan Opera Company it is good
policy sometimes to begin their seasons
there.
The theatre does not lead the
charmed Canberra life. Its general sub-
sidy is less than that for the nearby
Olympic pool. The director, Mr. Terry
Vaughan, has a small establishment
subsidy from the Treasury, which
enables him to put one foot into the
entrepreneurial field. He can go into
partnership with managements for par-
ticular productions, as he did recently
for “The Boy Friend.” This follows
much the routine of two commercial
managements each providing cash or
facilities and splitting at the end of the
production. However, the Treasury,
although not expert on the needs of
theatres, has made it clear that this is
an establishment fund and that the
theatre is expected to become self-
supporting.
The theatres are comfortable, the
foyers generous, there is a bar, and Mr.
Vaughan says the main stage is large
and most facilities adequate. However,
there are no rehearsal rooms and only
a small workshop, so there will have to
be major rethinking before a company
can be based there. The main theatre
is dual purpose. Acoustics are excellent
for drama but inevitably dry for music.
There is an orchestra pit cutting the
audience off from the stage for drama,
but it is not the yawning chasm they
have at Wagga, for example.
The chief practical difficulty facing
the theatre is that the larger theatre is
used also for ABC subscription concerts.
The ABC concert schedule is prepared
far in advance and is as immutable as
the tides. Generally there is only one
performance in Canberra. Theatre is
much more haphazard. Productions
become available at short notice, man-
agements with good reason change their
plans. Often an ABC one-night stand
will cbme right in the middle of the
period when a possibly highly lucrative
theatre attraction is available. This
means the theatre season has to be cut
short or abandoned or several have to
be jammed one after the other with
even the most willing audiences running
out of money for tickets.
Until Canberra gets a concert hall it
seems impossible for the theatre to get
maximum use. However, in 1967 the
theatre had 70 percent use and the
playhouse 76 percent.
Mr. Vaughan is not inhospitable
toward the musicians who use his
theatre. Formerly with J. C. William-
son’s, he himself was trained as a
musician and has conducted the
amateur Canberra Philharmonic, which,
helped out with the brass from the
Duntroon military college, has a
strength of about 96.
In fact, apart from the few visiting
fellows in the arts who have been at
the ANU and a very few painters, musi-
cians are really the only professional
practitioners of the arts in Canberra.
Most of these are at the National Music
School, which, under the direction of
the remarkable Mr. Ernest Llewellyn,
and with several noted musicians on the
staff, is housed in a converted baby
health centre at Manuka.
While it is nothing but the best for
books and paintings, people do not fare
so well.

So uncannily quiet is this new V 8 Rover that
one finds it hard to realise what an extremely
swift machine it is.
John Bolster of "Autosport" says: "When I first
drove the new Rover, I was absolutely
astonished at its silence."
William Boddie of "Motor Sport" says: "I would
describe it as similar to a Rolls-Royce Silver
Cloud to drive."
Yet, with all its phenomenal smoothness, this
new breed of Rover is capable of out-
accelerating almost anything on the road.
So here is an exceptional blend: a phenom-
enally quiet car of great refinement and luxury
which can nevertheless leave many a sports
car wallowing in its wake.
Beyond this, one discovers a multitude of
thoughtful extras that make a Rover a Rover
and set it that important degree apart from
other motor cars. The seats are armchairs.
The upholstery is leather. The front armrests
—both centre and side—are adjustable for
height.
Hidden beneath the centre padding of the
saloon is a trinket box. A picnic bench and a
writingtableslidesilently from secret recesses.
All passengers, both front and rear, are individ-
ually catered for with respect to heating and
even with respect to control of radio volume.
Everywhere one looks, one is reminded that
a Rover provides a degree of luxury and a
multiplicity of personalised accessories which
allow every situation to be viewed with a
degree of detached calm. Even when travelling
like blue blazes.
If all this makes you think you'd like to look
deeper into the 3.5 Litre Rover, perhaps you'll
let us know where to pick you up by calling
your nearest dealer, or your state distributor.

The great brain robbery
By ANTHONY HAAS
NEW ZEALAND’S current export
drive is helping its balance of payments
but harming her universities and pro-
fessional services. Last November’s
decision to devalue the New Zealand
dollar stimulated exports of primary
and manufactured goods, but also
accelerated the “brain drain” to Aus-
tralia and other countries.
The universities have been sensitive
to the debilitating effect of attractive
overseas salaries on their own strength
for some time, but the dramatic figures
confirming their fears have only just
been gathered. The New Zealand Asso-
ciation of University Teachers’ figures
show that several months ago New
Zealand began to lose more academic
and professional men than she recruited
abroad They also show how misleading
the Minister of Finance, Mr. Muldoon,
has been in his insistence that in New
Zealand “we are not suffering a brain
drain.”
Fighting their cause in public is not
relished by all university defenders;
emphasis on the magnitude of the
problem may stimulate the export
drive of academics and increases univer-
sities’ recruitment problems. Several
years ago some Vice-Chancellors were
withholding information about the
extent of the staff shortages to protect
their institutions, but the unwillingness
or inability of Government to act effec-
tively has created a situation where
more is needed than a quiet word in
the lobby.
Economics Professor lan McDougall,
of Massey University, has been gather-
ing the ammunition to fire at the
Government. He is currently president
of the Association of University
Teachers, but he, too, will be lost to
the fight when he leaves for Canada
at more than twice his current salary.
Professor McDougall claims that the
methods which Mr. Muldoon used to
show that in 1966-67 New Zealand
gained 345 more skilled people than it
lost, in effect show that the co.untry has
lost 294 more people than she gained.
This claim comes at a time when
the Government Statistician has pub-
licised statistics showing for the first
time since the war that more people of
all sorts are leaving instead of coming
to New Zealand. The figures revised
for Mr. Muldoon, which pay no atten-
tion to postgraduate students who leave
New Zealand but which count them
returning as skilled men and women,
show how deeply the losses are in New
Zealand’s reserves of expensively
trained manpower.
The country this year has lost 66
architects, engineers and surveyors, 54
chemists, physicists, geologists, and
other physical scientists, 26 jurists and
other specialised legal workers, 90
draughtsmen and science and engineer-
ing technicians, eight administrative
and executive officials, 52 other pro-
fessional, technical, and related workers.
Last year she gained 27 physicians, sur-
geons, and dentists, but only 19 were
recruited from other countries this year.
Thirty-one other professional medical
workers and medical technicians were
lost. Only 45 biologists, veterinarians,
agronomists, and related scientists were
recruited this year compared with 66
last year.
On Mr. Muldoon’s figures, the 118
teachers, including university teachers,
gained in 1966-67 fell to 29 lost in
1967-68, claims Professor McDougall.
The problem would be acute in a
static community, but the dynamic
pressures of national development and
the trend of the ’sixties, wl>ich is pro-
jected to increase student rolls as
rapidly as in the recent past will cause
something to break, somewhere, soon.
In 1961 there were 898 full-time estab-
lished university posts; in 1967 this
number was 1663. Even more serious
for university development is the end
of the era, when two-fifths of the staff
increases were recruited from overseas.
Australia has done pretty well out
of the big brain grab—attracting half
the New Zealanders who leave their
country. A tenth of the staff at the
Institute of advanced studies in the
Australian National University is New
Zealanders. There were 46 New
Zealanders at the ANU in 1966—the
year for which a survey was made by a
New Zealander, G. P. Taylor, writing
in the latest issue of the Australian
Universities’ Review “Vestes.” Other
universities with more than 20 New
Zealanders on their staffs were Sydney
with 34, Adelaide with 29, Queensland
and New South Wales with 25 each,
Melbourne and Monash with 24 each,
and New England with 22. There were
120 New Zealand academics in Great
Britain and 51 in Canada.
Mr. Taylor wrote that before New
Zealand devaluation and last year’s
increase in Australian academic salaries
there were 413 overseas full-time staff
in New Zealand Universities, and 455-
New Zealanders in the universities of
eleven Commonwealth countries.
Professor McDougall suggests that
non-Commonwealth countries, such as
the United States, have probably
attracted another 400 meaning New
Zealand has exported twice as many
academics as she has attracted.
The recent dramatic decline in
interest in New Zealand University
posts is shown from a New Zealand
Association of University Teachers’
survey indicating that 45 of the 60
percent of New Zealand academics
polled were awaiting the results of
applications for overseas posts, while
there were only twelve with applications
in the pipeline to New Zealand.
Professor McDougall speaks for
everybody when he says he thinks the
disparity between conditions in New
Zealand and elsewhere will make it
difficult, if not impossible, to recruit
from other countries as in the past.
Education Minister, Mr. A. Kinsella,
said he recognised that the situation
developing was detrimental to New
Zealand. But he argued that before
devaluation New Zealand salaries were
comparable with Australian, which
ignores the fact that, although the New
Zealand Government may have
accepted the principle of parity with
Australia the periodic salary reviews
Finance Minister Muldoon
(top) and Prof. McDougall
Labor leader Kirk (top)
and Dr. O’Farrell


of the past decade have meant that New
Zealand salaries have been one step
behind.
As well as losing staff to Australia,
New Zealand competes with her for
British staff, and both Australian and
British salaries tend to move ahead just
as those in New Zealand catch up with
the previous level.
The Universities Salaries Committee
is shortly to report to Cabinet. Its
chairman, Mr. A. J. Danks, has a repu-
tation in the universities which suggests
he will find out what Government
will provide, then suggest that figure
to them. To save New Zealand’s univer-
sities from choking to death he must
recommend parity with Australia, and
Cabinet must endorse it. To do so will
harass the Government with the claims
of scientists and professional men
inside and outside Government for
similar treatment. The Government
probably fears the trades unions will
also oppose such moves. Contact
between trades unions and university
students has been growing, however,
and for their support in protesting
against workers’ wage levels several
leading unionists have said to large
student audiences they would support
moves to increase university salaries.
Labor Minister Tom Shand has made
a contribution to attempts to increase
margins for professional skills by saying
to New Zealanders on the
equivalent of the ABC*“Four Corners”
program, that “the professions whose
skills are international place a limit on
how far a country can afford to be
egalitarian to a greater extent than her
neighbors.” “Compass” chairman lan
Cross suggested that the problem of
the brain drain was not just a question
of “money, money, money,” but rather
that the universities were “betraying
New Zealand’s growing sense of
national pride.” Professor McDougall
flatly disagreed with the contention
that money was not the cause.
At present, Australian universities
pay their lecturers at the top of the
salary scale more than a large number
of professors receive in New Zealand.
Australian senior lecturers at the top
of the salary scale receive $3350 more
than their New Zealand counterparts.
The average level -of Australian pro-
fessional salaries is $4OOO more than
those in New Zealand.
There are other conditions, says
Professor McDougall, which “make
more pathetic still the ability of New
Zealand to compete with the Australian
university system.” Superannuation
schemes in Australia are not only more
generous than those in New Zealand
but are freely transferable to universities
in other countries. Greater assistance is
given for housing university staff in
Australia. More liberal housing loans
are available to all staff (not merely to
staff recruited from elsewhere as in
New Zealand) and interest charges are
generally lower.
The National Development Planning
Conference is the best hope yet that,
with a clarification of national goals,
the education sector and the universi-
ties will be able to redirect their
energies to the training of the necessary
skills for New Zealand conditions.
Scientists point to previous weak-
nesses here, although a 1966 report of
the National Research Advisory
Council, which began a discussion of
scientific manpower needs, concluded
without a statement of the numbers
needed, as if to indicate the prospect
was frightening and political safety
demanded eliminating embarrassing
statistics.
Although applied-science technicians
have been produced in the agricultural
universities for farm advisory work, the
absence of national planning has left
New Zealand with too many chemists
and physicists for immediate needs, and
not enough biochemists and biophysi-
cists to develop secondary industries
from New Zealand’s primary products.
Not every New Zealander is worried
about the brain drain. To those estab-
lishing the new Universities of Papua-
New Guinea and of the South Pacific,
at Fiji, New Zealand academics have
provided the necessary first staff.
But to those who are legitimately
worried about the consequence for New
Zealand universities of staff shortages,
or the cost of inferior staff appointments
clogging the universities for a gener-
ation, a dramatic prod was provided
by one departing professor. Engineering
Professor F. M. Henderson, of Canter-
bury University, advised New Zealand
students to leave New Zealand at the
same time as he launched an attack on
New Zealand’s tax laws.
Even if the call to desert was not
received sympathetically, the attack on
the tax laws, which stop men becoming
rich on income, prefaces what could
become a growing topic of debate.
To show how the problem was viewed
from Australia I talked to a New
Zealander, Dr. P. J. O’Farrell, who
took his first degree at Canterbury
University and who now teaches history
at the University of New South Wales.
He came to Australia via the route
still followed by many postgraduate
students, the Australian National Uni-
versity. “I never felt as the professor
who said to New Zealand students to
leave it does. It was unfortunate, a lousy
thing to say,” he said.
Dr. O’Farrell contrasted his feelings
about Canterbury with Dublin, where
he spent a year. “With its economic
cii'cumstances it is like the Canter-
bury I left without equipment or
money. You cannot get things done
without a big battle for money every
time.
“But I would prefer Dublin for its
academic situation. Distance is a big
thing. Dublin is integrated into Europe.
From New Zealand you cannot get to
Paris in an hour, you cannot fly to
Strasbourg to look at the archives on
the German army.
“In Australia we are a. long way
out, but if I want a microfilm I can
get it. Money liberates Australian
scholars from their isolation; it does
not liberate the New Zealander.”
The physical characteristics of New
Zealand attract him. “I like cities, but
sometimes I hate cities and would like
to get out into the clean bush. Here it
is a fight to get into the suburbs. But
people do not draw me back, because
most of the people I ever knew have
gone from New Zealand. Furthermore,
Australia gives at least the illusion of
freedom. The police state is encroach-
ing hour by hour, but you get the
feeling you can do something. If you
have ideas, it might be possible to get
them across.”
“But,” said the man who wrote the
biography of a famous New Zealand
Trade Unionist (“Harry Holland
Militant Socialist”), “I am not being
fair to New Zealand. I think the welfare
state can become tyrannical but I still
have reason to be thankful for it. The
best social system is that which gives
everyone a chance to achieve his best,
but insures him against misfortune.
“In Australia they allow people
ample room for success but do not
protect them enough against misfor-
tune, failure, or old age. If you can
make a million, fine. But if you fail
you fall into the gutter and they will
probably drive over you in their new
Holden.
“If people were dedicated to New
Zealand’s idea, then people would get
involved and come back. I wish to God
New Zealanders had a passionate faith
in New Zealand and its creative destiny
and not the destiny that means
comfortable old age. If your goal is
old age then you are already dead. You
have got to keep moving with your
ideas, and the current Australian idea
is ‘boom.’ ”
New Zealand is certainly awakening
to her problem how swiftly and how
effectively is a matter for conjecture.
Labor Opposition Leader Kirk spot-
lighted the migration problem earlier
this session in Parliament, and although
he has yet to make a significant state-
ment on whether Labor would establish
parity with Australian salaries, there
are men in his party who are pressing
for just that sort of view.
Students are worried about the
situation. The protests at the opening
of Parliament this year were partly
caused by concern over the staffing
situation, and- the New Zealand Uni-
versity Students’ Association is to
appoint a full-time education-research
. officer whose initial task will be to
gather information on the problem.
The Sunday papers have begun to
highlight the problem with crisis stories
about teacher and doctor shortages. But
is it the quieter, more lasting faith in
New Zealand by many of those
academics who have resisted the call
of overseas salaries that is keeping New
Zealand’s universities together through
the crisis? But, as Professor Philpott, the
agricultural economist, whose expertise
has been harnessed by Government to
calculate the National Development
Conference targets, says, “how long
patriotism will save the universities is
an open question.”

Changing

By BRIAN HOAD
Industrial psychologist Ray Barker ...management
consultants are not men to be trifled with
YOU COULD be in the $lO,OOO a
year bracket already, well qualified,
eminently talented, and perhaps toy-
ing with the idea of that $15,000 a
year executive position advertised last
week. But think hard before you do
anything about it. For it seems that
very few of us are competent at self-
promotion.
With still four months to go before
the annual flood of new blood joins
the job hunt, the Commonwealth Em-
ployment Service is already offering
its advice on things to do and not to
do when negotiating with a prospec-
tive employer: “Think about what
you’ve got to offer . . . Appraise your
own qualifications . . . Don’t undersell
yourself . . . Think of some sensible
questions to ask.” And that’s pretty
sound advice as far as it goes whether
you are out to become an apprentice or
a managing director. But it doesn’t
go anywhere near far enough.
For the point is that if you launch
out after that $15,000 carrot, its odds-
on that you’ll start off well and truly
on the wrong foot. Your initial applica-
tion will be badly presented, ill-written,
misspelt, and irrelevant enough to try
the patience of a management con-
sultant. And with management con-
sultants very much in the ascendant
—having taken over something like 80
percent of the advertising and pre-
liminary selection for managerial posts
in commerce and industry—they are
not men to be trifled with.
“Somewhere between ten and 20 per-
cent of applications are good, 40 per-
cent are mediocre, and the rest are
horrible,” says lan Barraclough, a
director of Associated Industrial Con-
sultants. “On a rough average we get
about 40 applicants for each position
advertised, of which between eight and
ten we will want to interview, and,
say, three will get through to the
short-list; sometimes none of them will.”
About five new positions a week go
through the N.S.W. branch of John
P. Young and Associates. General
manager Ray Barker handles about
1500 of the interviews stemming from
these a year. He paints a similarly
surprising picture with slightly different
figures: “Probably something less than
30 percent of applications are really
appalling . . . But 50 percent seem
quite unable to present themselves
and have quite clearly given no serious
consideration to what the job entails
and how they relate to it.”
Incredible though it may seem, many
quite high-level executives, often with
their own experience of hiring personnel
and presumably experienced if not
expert in dictating letters and marshal-
ling their thoughts—communication is,
after all, an important part of their job
—seem, from the files of management
consultants, to be in sore need of some
advice when their turn comes to join
the job hunt—clearly a rare and trau-
matic experience.
And, resigned to a daily life of expos-
ing human frailty though they may be,
the consultants are willing enough to
indicate how a little pain may be
eliminated from the procedure for both
sides.
For a start, applicants should not act
compulsively and reach for the first
scrap of paper at hand. Barker recalls
without favor the illegible pencil scrawls
on odd scraps of paper he has received.
And although he will not eliminate you
from the running solely on the ground
of having borrowed a leaf from your
wife’s scented writing pad, you cannot
expect an association with the smell of
jasmine to be a point in your favor.
At the other extreme, you are not
going to impress Mr. Barraclough with
a calf-bound, gold-embossed portfolio of
paeans in your praise bearing some such
motto as “You cannot afford not to
employ me.” He has seen the likes of
of those before and is frankly sceptical.
Gimmicks and flamboyance fan the
flames of suspicion and your more per-
tinent claim s will come in for some
extra scrutiny when and if they are
discovered within the general mass of
irrelevance.
Ideally, the application should
consist of a concise curriculum vitae
(typed) an d a covering letter (hand-
written). But Barker insists that the
latter is not for reasons of graphology;
some nationalities, particularly the
Dutch, tend to distil much significance
from such a study, but it is an art which
finds ! ‘ ttle ust ', h f re ' Barker is rather
mo f? mterested ln whether V™. san5 an
?P ell and how >\ ou P resel ; t V™ wntm «
beautifully typed curricula can turn out
*° u hav s be f n P re P ared by someone
other than the a PP h cant.
Photo-copied sheets are not particu-
larly frowned upon so long as you make
it d ear i n the letter why you are
engaged on a high-powered job hunt,
It j s wise to be consistent: a photo-
copied curriculum and a covering letter
which starts My attention has been
drawn to,your advertisement . . . wont
fool anyone that you re not urgently
looking for a job; while a copy which
incorporates the date of November last
year is going to make the consultant
wonder whether you suffer from a
severe personality defect to have been
looking around so long,
To avoid unnecessary disappoint-
ments, read the advertisement carefully
—much thought has gone into its word-
ing—and try to put yourself in the
employer’s shoes, matching his key
specifications with your own attributes,
In your covering letter, get straight to
the point with an absolute minimum
preliminary fuss and no cliches,
indicating that part of your experience
most relevant to the qualities called for.
Be concise in your curriculum, but
leave no historical gaps. If you were
on a round-the-world trip for a year,
or in prison, say so. If you were given
the sack, be frank, but don’t go into


elaborate explanations—they can wait
until later. Honesty is particularly the
best policy if you have had dealings
with the consultant before. Your pre-
vious letters will be on file and your
current application will be checked with
them for inconsistencies before you are
asked for an interview. Consultants take
a dim view of people who have grown
ten years younger over the past two
years or whose past histories have
undergone a metamorphosis.
At this stage the consultant is not
interested in the details of early child-
hood, the troubles involved in bringing
up the children, social milieu, or
personal fads and fancies. That all
comes later. But for the moment he
would like to know how old you are,
your telephone number, and, above all,
your name. Consultants can become
utterly frustrated by an illegible signa-
ture; no matter how beautifully it
flourishes, you must decode it plainly.
You are selling yourself, but in the
initial foray don’t overplay your hand.
A good executive image is still important—avoid pullovers under suits,
green ties, suede shoes. Spectacles, even with plain glass, lend distinction
Mr. Barker admits to having been fav-
orably impressed by an application for
an advertising executive’s job which
arrived with a carrier pigeon; he per-
sonally supervised the launching of the
bird from the top of Caltex House
bearing back an invitation to interview.
But if a works manager had been
involved it probably would have been
a different matter.
Not that works managers are liable
to get up to such tricks. They, indeed,
together with most of the technical
and scientific applicants, seem to have
an automatic tendency to stilted
language and a complete abhorrence of
self-selling:—“l have been chief engi-
neer here for 20 years and would like
the job you are offering.” Yet they can
have the advantage over excessive gush:
“Sometimes you think they might be
good even though they have told you
hardly anything about themselves. You
feel you can’t afford to miss out, and
so you interview them just in case,”
says Barker.
Don’t become outraged if after pre-
paring a perfect application you are
then asked to fill in all the same facts
again on a standard form. Even the
best of us can leave out something vital.
And, anyway, it puts all candidates for
interview on an equal footing as far
as the enlightenment of the consultants
is concerned. The initial application
has often tended to tell a different kind
of story.
On a rough average, about one-
quarter of applicants are invited for
interview. The favored few should put
in some homework beforehand. If you
have ambitions to become the manag-
ing director of a spectacle-frame manu-
facturer, find out something about the
state of the industry, and if the parti-
cular firm is mentioned, check up on
its history, too. For when the time
comes for the applicant to start asking
the questions, it is best to think on a
bigger scale than pension funds.
The job specifications of the initial
advertisement should be committed
completely to memory. And if, despite
yourself, you were unable to be ruth-
lessly honest in the initial letter, make
sure of exactly what you did say. You’ll
probably be found out the consultant
is on the lookout and has your appli-
cation prominently at hand during the
interview and it is wise to be ready
with an explanation.
It is best to be forthright about why
you are leaving or why you are job-
hunting. That old chestnut about
“policy disagreements with the MD” is
not good enough. If you have had a row,
say so and say why. The reasons can
be instructive - particularly if you
always lose and need not eliminate
you from the running. Many people
land up in the wrong-sized job with
the wrong opportunities. It’s the respon-
sibility of the consultants to see that
those numbers diminish.
Even for the most experienced execu-
tive, interviews can prove a nerve-
racking time; the technique varies from
consultant to consultant, but sooner or
later they (and there could be two or
three going for you at a time) will
launch a “depth-quiz” or “stress-
interview” to make it more so. There's
no preparation you can make for this
except to eliminate the surprise factor
and expect it. The consultants are not
just checking your credentials and your
social background. They are as much
interested in your emotional make-up
as your intellectual asset; your senti-
ments, attitudes, and dispositions as
well as your aptitudes and attainments.
Some of the consultants you will
have to face will be fully trained indus-
trial psychologists. Try not to become
indignant if they ask you to carry out
an assortment of odd and apparently
puerile tests. Industrial psychology is a
relatively young but rapidly developing
science. Its practitioners’ methods of
searching out defects are no more con-
temptible than your optician’s. Others
practise their psychological manoeuvres
more as an art than a science; they are
looking for the same things, but in a
way that is less apparent to you, and
they will only call in the scientific
approach if their client requests it.
But, in general, the power of the indus-
trial psychologist is growing and it is
only an extra burden on your nerves,
to resent it.
If you do not get passed on to the
consultant’s short-list, even though in
all honesty you felt you were perfectly
fitted, don’t think he has some personal
thing against you. He’s sometimes work-
ing under a pretty stringent brief from
his client, which can spread well beyond
your concepts of excellence for the job.
There are the usual religious and racial
prejudices—“ The Dutch and Germans
are too dogmatic”—there might be a
call for “driving ambition” or “recog-
nisable social refinements” and the
sports you don’t play or the clubs you’ve
never thought of joining might exclude
you also.
Some employers are precise about
these fringe characteristics, others are
very vague indeed, and, anyway, with
management and technical people in
short supply this is hardly a buyers’ -
market. If the consultant thinks you
are good in all other respects he will
try to persuade the client to lower
his sights, or overcome his preju-
dices, though he won’t necessarily suc-
ceed. The failure rate in filling
positions is by no means high among
the management consultants here, but
at a rough average of four percent it
is twice as high as it is in the U.K.
If he can muster as many, the con-
sultant makes a final selection of about
three people. He lists their weaknesses-
and strengths and gives his recommen-
dations, and if you have made the
grade it is now between you and the
employer. The final decision on whether
or not you will get the job will probably
be a emotional one, and there’s no
telling what quirks will come into play.
Mr. Barker has known a perfectly suit-
able applicant rejected at the last
because he turned up without a hat.
But who’d want to work for an
employer with a kink about hats,
anyway?


Musical chairs at
the Trust
By DENIS O'BRIEN
YEARS of rhubarb have conditioned us
to expect the Elizabethan Theatre Trust
to have revolving cheeks: slap one and
another turns complacently into view.
The name of the game has never been
aggressiveness. It was not surprising
then that a stray remark by Mr.
Stephen Hall, the New Man at the
Trust, uttered last week during a con-
fusion of interviews, should have been
so arresting.
“Don’t misquote me or I’ll hit you,”
said Mr. Hall, with a strange dis-
regard for a good newspaperman’s keen
ear for an embarrassingly deathless
quote. Ye gods! Had the Theatre of
Cruelty come to Dowling Street? No,
it was really only a throwaway line,
but it suited a week which brought
about a significant revolution at the
Trust after months of discreet insur-
gency.
Mr. Hall, a smooth-faced 32, has
come out of it with the new title of
Secretary and Co-ordinator of the
Trust and obviously is heir-apparent to
its chief executive chair. He should not
waste his muscles on errant reporters;
he should conserve them for the battles
to come.
Cheeks may be turned, comment
withheld, or denials angrily proclaimed,
but it is a fact that there are minor
power struggles taking place at all levels
of administration of the Elizabethan
Trust organisation. Last week’s major
reshuffle of positions was, as a well-
placed Trust man confided to me, only
an iceberg tenth of what is going on.
The departure earlier this year of
Dr. H. C. Coombs to the Council for
the Arts removed the last restraining
influence on top-echelon struggles which
began simmering about 15 months ago.
Key to the situation has been the
six-man executive committee of the 31-
member board, with Mr. Claude
Alcorso, a textile manufacturer, and
Mr. Maurice Timbs, executive commis-
sioner of the Atomic Energy Commis-
sion, said to be its most aggressively
progressive members. Certainly the
executive committee has strengthened
its influence on the Trust’s artistic
affairs, and some lower-placed adminis-
trators, taking the cue, have assumed a
greater degree of independent confi-
dence.
The immediate loser in this power
game would appear to be Mr. Stefan
Haag, who has been the Trust’s execu-
tive director since 1962, but who now
becomes its artistic adviser. Semantics
can’t disguise the fact that Mr. Haag
has lost ground, although the chairman
of the Trust, Sir lan Potter, was care-
ful to release the new administrative
positions in alphabetical order
Haag, Hall, Mr. Donald McDonald,
finance director, and Mr. Bruce Scott,
operations manager—and to point out
that all four shared “equal pegging,”
as he put it.
It is known that Mr. Haag had him-
self suggested some administrative
reorganisation but that his virtual dis-
placement by Mr. Hall was a shock to
him. His resignation was tipped, but the
guess now is that he will stay with
the Trust until it becomes feasible for
him to apply for or be appointed to
one of the several senior artistic posi-
tions coming with the Sydney Opera
House. Mr. Haag entered hospital for
minor dental surgery last Thursday,
refusing to comment on the changes
at the Trust.
The confusing feature of the reshuffle
is that it is keyed to the development
of the Australian Council for the Arts,
but seems to presume more knowledge
of the Council’s intentions than anyone
else has.
“The rearrangement has become
necessary following the establishment of
the Council, which will progressively
take over the artistic and financial
responsibility for all the theatrical arts
now under the control of the Trust,”
said Sir lan Potter. “The role of the
Trust in future will be largely entre-
preneurial and the present reorganisa-
tion is directed toward providing facili-
ties to the separate entities (opera,
ballet, and drama) in their new inde-
pendent status.”
Conceivably, the Council’s assump-
tion of most of the Trust’s old roles
should have meant a proper shrinking
at the Trust with fewer people to do
less work. Instead, the Trust has beefed
up its administrative structure, added
to its salary bill, and made token
preparations for work which hasn’t
even yet been handed to it.
And none of this putting and taking
in the administration of the arts in
Australia has yet meant anything to the
practice of the arts. The opera and
ballet companies already had begun to
spin off into autonomous operation;
drama still languishes. Until the Council
for the Arts gets more than a nominal
budget and has time to research its
priorities it is difficult to see how any
amount of desk-changing can galvanise
the arts.
What is plainly apparent, though, is
that the desk-changing at the Trust’s
headquarters in Dowling Street has
caused overcrowding along the executive
corridor. Mr. Hall last week was still
sharing an office with Donald Mc-
Donald (who went to the Trust from
Stephen Hall: “We are stronger...”
" ...the liaison has improved ...”
"...the challenge is tremendous..."
"...I am very excited”

“Vogue” magazine), although he was
borrowing the absent Stefan Haag’s
office for the string of Press interviews
which so tied up his diary that at one
stage he was more difficult to get into
see than a hit show on Broadway.
When I interviewed him he had
already been reported as saying that
he was “very excited” about the
“tremendous challenge” of his job, and
that the reorganised Trust still had “a
most exciting role to play in the
theatrical arts in Australia,” but he was
unable to spell out any positive clues
that would help us share the excite-
ment. He said he resented my suggestion
that all that had happened was that the
bureaucracy had been enlarged and
preferred to put it that the organisation
had been strengthened.
Stephen Hall is a clear-eyed and
presentably good-looking young man
with an early background in journalism
(“The Sydney Morning Herald”) and
a passion for theatre which caused him
to toss in his job as a reporter and
begin a theatrical career with an Aus-
tralian touring company in the musical
“Salad Days.” He went to England in
the ’fifties, where he did a little acting
on TV and in the West End before
moving to stage management at
Covent Garden. He came back to
Australia in 1965 to stage-manage a
production of “Porgy and Bess” and
then the “Ballet Folklorico.” Subse-
quently, he became Stefan Haag’s
administrative assistant, and for the past
18 months has been co-ordinator of
the Trust’s opera company and, most
recently, responsible for the productions
of “Turandot” and “Girl of the Golden
West.”
Last week he was diplomatically
non-committal about what happens now,
although he says the primary benefits
of the new situation will be “a greater
sense of liaison between the Trust and
the Council . . . clearer lines of com-
munication.” When I asked him how
important he thought one man’s
enthusiasm could be in galvanising the
arts, he waxed lyrical, talking about
the “exciting influence” of England’s
Peter Hall. He didn’t agree with me
that it now appeared the Trust would
have to settle for committee enthusiasm.
Opera is his favorite performing art
(“I’ve always thought if it comes off
it’s the best of the theatrical arts”),
and hoped that “the time will come
when the opera company can branch
out into more modern works.” He said
the Trust had “plans” for drama, but
wasn’t in a position to reveal them.
“My personal opinion—and this is not
necessarily the view of the Trust—is
that the ideal would be a national
drama company, like the national ballet
and opera companies.”
He had just seen the Melbourne
Theatre Company’s production of
Chekhov’s “Three Sisters.” “Have you
seen it? Oh, you must, you must. It’s
really first rate.” Maybe, but “Macbeth”
might have seemed a more apt play for
a week of revolution.


BUSINESS
AND THE ECONOMY
The beginning of the end of sterling?
Another crisis at
Bank of England
SINCE IT IS pretty meaningless
anyway, it is best not to become too
preoccupied with that “gentleman’s
agreement” on the unfettered flow of
portfolio capital from and through
Britain to Australia which was thrown
up in the latest arrangements for
backing sterling last week. For the basis
of the exercise at Basle was not the
defence of sterling so much as another
manoeuvre to buy time for a failing
international monetary system. And if
from that point of reference the benefits
of blocking such an outflow should
outweigh the damage of whatever
retaliation on sterling reserves Australia
might be likely to take, then the flow
would undoubtedly be blocked. Prag-
matism is very much the order of the
day.
But would Australia be likely to take
any retaliation? Clearly, in taking the
lead amongst sterling area countries on
agreeing to the new terms for preserving
sterling balances, Australia was as con-
cerned as anyone, and more concerned
than some, that faith be preserved in
the financing of international trade and
payments through the dollar-gold-
sterling system, for there is as yet no
alternative. If the gold-rush of last
March has taught the Western world
one thing, it is that the basic weakness
of the present system and any other is
a loss of faith in it.
The agreement of the sterling-area
countries to accept the freeze on their
reserves, and the undertaking of the
Central Banks of Austria, Belgium,
Canada, Denmark, Germany, Italy,
Japan, The Netherlands, Norway,
Sweden, Switzerland, and the U.S. to
make available $2OOO million for back-
ing those reserves simply illustrates the
complex and inextricable embrace in
which the trading nations of the West
are locked. And the greatest danger
is the individual action of national
interest. Ironically enough, the origin-
ally planned French contribution to the
deal failed to materialise. But then,
France has troubles of her own at this
time. To try to seize a momentary
advantage by hitting out at somebody
else, as France did last March, is in-
evitably to hit oneself as hard if not
harder than the system as a whole.
But the gold-infatuated actions of a
De Gaulle, the interminable series of
sterling crises, and the scavenging of
speculators on the world’s money mar-
kets tend to be the products rather
than the causes of the failing system,
though aggravating products. The past
suggests that in time another system
will evolve. But in this, the transition
period, the changes are more likely to
be painful than not, and even for those
most intimately concerned the steps
involved may neither be obvious nor
particularly understandable.
Some sources in London, almost with
a sigh of relief, see the Basle agree-
ment as the beginning of the end of
sterling’s role as a reserve currency.
Others point out that the new arrange-
ments for freezing and guaranteeing
reserves are a move specifically de-
signed to preserve sterling in its inter-
national role. The former attitude is
probably too long-sighted, the latter
too narrow a view. For what did
happen last week was that the old
sterling area died, while the inter-
national monetary system, as we know
it, was given another crutch on which
to make as comfortable an exit as it
may.
TEXTILE FIBRES
DEPOSING THE KING
THE LATEST INDICATIONS that
the world’s man-made-fibres industry
is set again on a sharp upswing in
production should not worry the wool
producers unduly. With the Inter-
national Wool Secretariat well advanced
in establishing its products in the
“prestige” area of marketing, the obvi-
ously suicidal direct competition with
synthetics is being avoided, and wool
has been launched on its own course
to determine its own success. Hopes for
a steadily increasing outlet, despite a
decline in the overall share of the fibres
market, are high.
Though frequently criticised, the
IWS’ apparent preoccupation with
marketing problems would seem to be
creating a reasonably comfortable
future for wool, no matter how healthily
synthetics may bounce back after the
acute growing pains of 1966-67. The
volume of synthetics sales for the first
six months of this year is up by about
20-25 percent on 1967.
But the 12 months from July, 1966,
were bad ones for man-made-fibres:
producers throughout the world.
Demand as a whole did not increase-
much and in some quarters actually
decreased, which was a dreadful state
of affairs for an industry which had
come to expect a 15 percent annual
growth rate. Profits of all the major
producers slumped.
In the end it was price cutting which
enabled producers to turn the corner,,
one massive round in 1966 and another
in 1967. The result was prices more
than 50 percent lower than those
existing in 1960, while, by contrast,
cotton showed an increase of 10 percent
and wool one of 5 percent. And, in due
course, the cuts restoked demand.
But, despite their rapid growth,
synthetics still account for only 16-
percent of the total world consumption
of fibres, though rayon takes up another
19 percent. King-cotton still holds the
major, but failing, grip on 56 percent,
its stake in the fibres market having-
turned into an absolute decline, and its
peak production of 25,432 million
pounds in 1965 unlikely ever to be
reached again.
With many desirable qualities, includ-
ing cheapness, as yet not fully emu-
lated by synthetics, the decline of cotton
should be a graceful one. But as an
old - fashioned staple commodity
produced in a great many countries, it
is simply not organised enough to-
ensure that this will be so. The six
nations which account for more than
half the world’s exports of cotton
America, India, Mexico, Spain, Sudan,
and Egypt—formed the International
Institute of Cotton .some 18 months
ago to research and promote the fibre,
but not much has happened since and
there are signs of precious little collec-
tive effort in the face of the common
enemy, synthetics.
All this leaves wool, taking a steadily
declining cut in the overall fibres market
(9 percent last year) but slowly increas-
ing its production nonetheless under
the guidance of an effective central


body, the International Wool
Secretariat.
As in every other business, in the
end it will be the varying market
strategies of the three main contenders
in the fibres stakes which will prove
decisive in future trends. Wool is rea-
sonably well placed under the IWS at
the “prestige” end of the trade in terms
of quality and price. The synthetics
producers are aggressively confident
that they will keep pushing ahead,
though occasionally dogged, perhaps,
with more rather profitless periods.
And cotton is asleep. It remains a
highly distinctive fibre: crisp, cool,
comfortable, adaptable, and with plenty
of fashion-appeal. It has price and
plenty of public goodwill in its favor.
And although, almost inevitably, it is in
retreat, there are all manner of things
it can do to make that retreat very
slow indeed. At the moment, it seems
incapable of doing any of them. But
if cotton woke up —and the formation
(at least) of the International Institute
for Cotton would indicate that someone
somewhere is stirring to the problem—
then future projections for the world’s
fibres market might have to be radically
revised.
MEN AND MATTERS
ALL HIS LIFE hosiery has been a big
beautiful world to Beau Monde’s chair-
man and managing director, 61-year-old
H. M. Anderson “Hardheaded
Harry” as he’s known around the
nation’s hosiery mills. It’s been so good
for him, and him for it, that eight of
his fifteen children have followed in
his footsteps into it. Some of those
still at school also have designs in the
same direction, doubtless encouraged
by their father’s rapid transformation
of affairs at Beau Monde since his
arrival about eighteen months ago
after passing on the managing-director’s
job at the family firm to his eldest son,
Harry. His children are, it appears,
strategically placed around Beau Monde
and Nightingales (the family firm’s
trade name) in a way which would
make a marriage between the two firms
as easy as pie when the time is ripe.
In tfie past 45 years or so, Mr. Ander-
son (his father was a Scot) has prob-
Harry Anderson
Marshall Ney
ably seen the inside, of more textile
mills than most of his contemporaries.
But workwise he has never strayed far
from where he was born and went to
school, in the inner Melbourne suburb
of Coburg. He went straight from
school into the hosiery trade and has
been there ever since, working first in
various mills around Melbourne as a
mechanic until 1930, when, with his
father and brother, he established the
family firm Anderson Hosiery Mills
(the “Nightingale” people), of course,
at Coburg. With the big depression of
the period looming up it was not exactly
the best time to start a business, even
one on a pretty small scale, making
children’s socks on a pair of machines.
However, it survived and by 1935 had
widened its range to include women’s
hosiery and sports socks. All this time
Anderson had been building up his
reputation as a mechanic, which put the
company in the box seat when seam-
less nylons were developed in the 19505.
Anderson converted the company’s
machines to produce the new vogue,
established a clear lead over the rest
of the industry, and for a long time
the firm was the biggest supplier of
such hosiery in the country.
Vln getting Mr. Anderson to come
over from- Coburg to take charge of
affairs, Beau Monde has not only got
somebody with unrivalled experience in
the business, but also one who is
unlikely to tempt it outside the hosiery
trade. As with his dedication to hosiery,
he is a “loner” in private life. Natur-
ally his family (they live at Ivanhoe)
claims most of his time and attention
now, though earlier he was active in
football on his home Coburg ground.
FROM BUTTONS to the zipper busi-
ness may not, at first sight, look
like a vast progression, but production
techniques are infinitely more com-
plex for zippers, so the man who has
made a comfortable living from but-
ton manufacture in Australia, Mr.
Marshall Ney, invited the largest
zipper maker in the world, YKK of
Japan, to join him in making zippers
in Brookvale, N.S.W.
YKK has been exporting to Aus-
tralia for some time, but high tariff
barriers have impeded progress on
the local market. Initially YKK Aus-
tralia Pty. Ltd. will import tapes,
metal wire, and slides from Japan,
but it looks forward to manufacturing
these components here eventually.
The Japanese business was begun by
a Mr. Yoshida in 1934. He is the same
age as Mr. Ney, 62, and last year
graduated from being the 1 lth-highest-
salaried man in Japanese industry to
fifth. His company’s annual turnover
now stands at about $34 million.
Mr. Ney’s career in the fastener in-
dustry dates back to Depression days
when he and his brother began in
buttons with $50,000. They were mak-
ing mother-of-pearl buttons, and at
that stage Burns Philp was supplying
the shell. That company was encouraged
by the Scullin Government to make
buttons, too, and brought out two
Viennese to run a factory in Went-
worth Avenue, Sydney. However it
was losing $28,000 a year, so a merger
was effected with the very successful
Ney business.
This happy association with Burns
Philp continued until the introduction
of the new Companies Act, which re-
quired companies to reveal their full
interests, and Burns Philp chose to
sell out its 50 percent interest in the
company Beutron Plastics Pty. Ltd. to
the Neys’ investment company, G.
Herring Australia Pty. Ltd.
A few years later F. W. Williams was
looking for extension of its plastics,
interests, with the eventual building up
of a brand image, and that company
bought a half-interest in Beutron. But
with the takeover of F. W. Williams,
Mr. Ney’s partner became Pioneer
Concrete.
Pioneer is now running Beutron, but
Mr. Ney is still a director and he will
be chairman of the new venture. Mr.
Ney’s son, David, 33, will be general
manager and a director. J
PRODUCTIVITY CAMPAIGN
CONFUSION AND DESPAIR
IT IS REALLY somewhat irresponsible
of employers to attempt to pass the
buck of productivity problems on to the
shoulders of their employees. But if
the 50,000 booklets on the subject pro-
duced by the Institute of Public Affairs
to be sent out to the workshops of
industry have a purpose, it seems to
be just that.
Productivity, as the booklet points
out, depends on people and not just
technological innovation; it is another
word for efficiency, which boils down
to how much each person contributes
to the total output of all goods and
services; and it is undoubtedly the
key to better living standards. But
productivity on the human level at
which the IPA is here attempting to
tackle it is also very much a matter
of industrial psychology, of motivation,
and that is entirely the responsibility
of the employers. If the current booklet
is an attempt on their part to realise
that responsibility, then it is as likely
to effect an improvement in the con-
dition as is a doctor in a patient by
waving a somewhat garbled diagnosis
in front of him.
After 16 pages of a well-illustrated
attempt to define their elusive subject,
it is not difficult to sense a somewhat
desperate confusion in the IPA’s naive
approach to essentially complex psycho-
logical problems. But then psychology
and the social sciences in general are
still largely matters for contemptuous
dismissal amongst the captains of in-
dustry. They have laid their own trap
and the IPA walks straight into it.
How, for example, does the IPA


hope to get employees more dedicated
to their work tasks by telling them
that in the next 20 years they can
“expect” similar or even greater gains
in their living standards through pro-
ductivity than those which have occured
since 1948 to put Australia’s standard
of living per head of population fifth
highest in the world after the U.S.,
Switzerland, Sweden, and Canada?
The IPA warms to its theme by
pointing out the 18,000 miners who in
1949 produced 9.4 million tons of coal
and to the 12,000 miners who produced
26.8 million tons of coal in 1967,.
mostly through mechanisation. It notes,
too, that an average male factory worker
in 1968 has to work only 1500 hours
to earn enough to buy a car, compared
with 3700 hours in 1948, or 200 hours
for a refrigerator, compared with 700
hours: “Productivity is not just a ques-
tion of working harder for longer
hours.” And if the worker assumes from
this that the scientists and the tech-
nologists and their machines can go on
boosting productivity while they sit back
and wait for the Arbitration Commis-
sion to hand them their share of a
relentlessly rising national cake, then
it isn’t all that surprising. After all, only
too many of the employers represented
by the IPA are liable to make matters
still worse by using over-award pay-
ments as a cure-all for the labor and
productivity problems which beset
them.
In its new brochure, however, the IPA
rightly gives the lie to that practice and
tempers any indolent thoughts in its
readers by pointing out that wage in-
creases which run ahead of productivity
gains result in inflationary pressures-
which slow down productivity increases.
But is such righteous economic
sophistry really likely to drive home to-
people on the work-bench the message-
of restraint when they are budgeting
with little if nothing to spare, geared
to the extravagant living of an affluent
society?
The field of motivating employees to
greater productivity is wide open to-
any employer willing to experiment
practically with human vagaries. In a
recent conference on productivity in
Sydney, a classic experiment on workers
assembling electronic components was
recalled: The lighting in the workshop
was increased and, predictably, produc-
tion went up; a further increase in
lighting produced another increase in
production; then the level of lighting
was decreased and, paradoxically, pro-
duction increased again, and further
decreases only resulted in production
increases. The point is that it wasn’t
the lighting which had achieved the
motivation so much as the practical in-
terest taken in the employees.
Productivity is, as the IPA rightly
says, the key to better living standards
and to better profits, too. But its
increase is only achieved by employers
(through their employees). So perhaps
the IPA will be addressing its next
publication on the subject to the
employers.
Speculator’s Diary
THERE'S MONEY FOR
TOP PEOPLE
IN STOCK OPTIONS
FORGET about playing the stock-
market (especially in these gloomy
days); there are better ways of mak-
ing money. All you have to do is
become an executive in one of those
successful companies like Lend Lease
Corporation or Hanimex that issue
share options to their top men in
order to keep them happy at their
work—and to discourage them from
leaving for greener fields, because the
share options lapse if they do so.
This is a good system. If an execu-
tive is given an option to take up loads
of shares in several years’ time at
around the current 'market price, he
will work like hell to make the com-
pany do much better, so that its
share price will rise significantly and
his options will be worth big money.
Look at what happened to Bill Leavey,
managing director of Lend Lease Cor-
poration. When joint - managing -
director David Elsworth left Lend
Lease in April, 1965, the company de-
cided to hold on to its remaining m.d.
by giving him the option to take up
300,000 Lend Lease shares at 81 cents
in five years’ time.
Lend Lease shares were then below
a dollar; they are now more than $2.
And last week’s one-for-ten bonus means
that Mr. Leavey’s options (along with
the 450,000 options held by other Lend
Lease executives) are immediately
exercisable. So Mr. Leavey’s $243,000
worth of options have suddenly turned
into $606,000 worth of shares—a profit
(on paper) of $363,000 to him.
So Lend Lease is doing it again and
last week issued another 700,000 shares
to 165 executives at $1.82 when the
market price was about $2.02. It could
be that the company’s shares may be
below this when the options fall due,
but there will be 165 executives trying
with all their 'might to make the com-
pany sufficiently successful so that the
shares rise considerably higher. Share-
holders might be a bit unimpressed by
the way the company’s capital eventu-
ally gets diluted under this system, but
if it brings in bigger and better profits,
then that seems good enough to me.
Money doesn’t come as easily as that
to me; in fact, I’ve had a pretty sorry
time of it in the past few weeks. So
I’m leaving the mining end of the busi-
ness alone for a bit until the burns on
my fingers heal. Instead, Pm looking
for the sort of recovery situations that
should hold up even if the market
decides to get even more crotchety than
it has already; One of these is
Concrete Industries Monier Ltd., the
cement-pipe and tile people who had
such a disastrous flirtation with civil
contracting, particularly with the U.S.
Navy radio station at North West
Cape.
There are two things giving this
company a fair amount of speculative
interest at the moment; firstly, the like-
lihood of more good news on its multi-
million-dollar claims against the U.S.
Navy on top of this week’s success on
the important $2 million pier claim,
and secondly, the fact that its major
reorganisation program now seems to
have got the company well and truly
on the recovery road.
On the navy claims, the company’s
managing director, Keith Milburn, is
at present in Washington. So far Monier
has won most of its claims and it is
now certain that its $6 million pro-
vision will be at least enough to cover
its losses. There is even the prospect
of sizable amounts of the provision
being unused. The next few weeks could
bring more action on the old suspect
steel claim that Monier won 18 months
ago and against which only $750,000
has so far been paid. Then there is
the further claim for “extraordinary
relief” that directors seem to think
has a fair chance of success.
But the company’s reorganisation
program is probably the most bullish
thing about the stock. Now it is con-
centrating entirely on its old job of
making building materials. It has
chopped off all its deadwood (such
as its steel-reinforcing subsidiary), has
stopped competing with its customers,
and has used the cash received from
these disposals for significant expan-
sion in its plant capacity around Aus-
tralia for roofing tiles, concrete
masonry blocks, and its traditional job
of pipes, as well as building up its
successful Californian operation.
One obvious sale I had to make this
week was the L. J. Hooker Corpor-
ation. Why obvious? Well, it simply
has stopped being a speculative stock;
it has turned into a sound growth in-
vestment that will probably be double
its present price over the .next four
years or so. Following its return to
dividends, with inevitable steady in-
creases to come, it has become a stock
for sensible investors, not speculators.
This leave kitty at $389.

The 3 worlds of Australia's BHP
BHP is Australia’s own great industrial enterprise, with operations in steel, mining, oil and gas.
On all three fronts the Company is pursuing a vigorous policy of expansion
and development. More minerals. More oil and gas. And more and better steels. This is not
unusual at BHP. For 85 years the Company has been active in developing
Australia for Australians. The pattern will continue, as BHP forges ahead to provide Australia’s
industrial leadership into the 21st Century.

BRIEFLY
The 6COnomy' The Federal Government has agreed to
keep at least 40 percent of Australia’s total holding of gold
and foreign exchange in sterling; as a quid pro quo, the
U.K. has given a dollar guarantee against further
devaluation covering about 80 percent of Australia’s official
sterling reserves.
A newly proposed five-year plan for Papua and New
Guinea is estimated to cost $lOOO million; it will concen-
trate upon agriculture and the economy’s infrastructure.
The Australian Resources Development Bank has slightly
lowered interest rates on a second $2O million issue of
Transferable Certificates of Deposit.
New lending by the trading banks averaged $40.7
million a week over the five weeks to August 14, compared
with $35.5 million in the four-week period to July 10.
The markets: A mood of unremitting drift has seized
most sections of the Australian share markets. Especially
among industrials, dealings are becoming very selective
indeed particular circumstances are calling
the investment tune.
Investors have almost begun to express a
love-hate relationship toward BHP. News from Barracouta
produced an upward kick, but the whole week saw a
net $2.20 retreat to a closing $19.90.
Great Boulder furnished some 'relief to the miners,
gaining $1.20 to reach $18.70. Yet the falls were
mighty and legion: Hamersley $13.70 (down 40 cents),
Peko $14.15 (25 cents), CRA $21.60 (50 cents), New
BH $17.50 ($1.30), Renison $6.80 (30 cents),
and Western Mining just steady at $12.60.
With BHP, most leaders were variable. Special
events sent Sydney Mutual up 40 cents to $5.00 and
Kolotex up 92 cents to $5.22. Slater Walker
bounced forward 80 cents to $7.40.
Some early profit-taking in London was followed by a
fair amount of buying on merger and takeover
chances, giving the list a somewhat irregular
look at the close.
On fairly heavy volume, Wall Street picked up
well on Friday, making a fair response to
some good economic indicators.
Companies: With more than usual hyper-scrupulousness
of expression, Esso-BHP reported a flow rate of
3200 barrels of high-gravity oil a day from the Barracouta
A-4 development well; “there are many questions still
to be answered.”
Teething problems and tin prices are not a happy
combination for the Aberfoyle group, which has suffered
a $270,158 net loss and will pay only 2| percent
in contrast to the previous year’s 10 percent; the parent
profit slipped from $377,270 to $223,278; partly owned
Cleveland Tin lost $762,090 in its first year, while
Ardlethan struggled up from $50,895 to $116,334 . . .
More hopefully, King Island Scheelite may have found
a new orebody and is also recommending the Consolidated
Gold Fields takeover; mine operating profit for the year
to August will be “somewhat lower” ... For New Broken
Hill it is more than somewhat, so interim dividend is
cut from 20 to 15 percent after a 10 percent decline
in net revenue.
Mr. Daniel K. Ludwig can also try most things;
one Of his Australian offshoots is to secure a 50 percent
holding in Sydney Mutual Insurance for $4.8 million . . .
Insurance mergers are still prevalent: the local
Commercial Union will follow its London parent to join
with Northern and Employers (including the life activity);
CUA has brought dividend from 10 to 11 percent.
The rural fringe begins to look better . . . Wool and
skin merchant William Haughton changed a $153,743
loss into a $280,704 profit . . . Rural builder R. and N.
Statham more than trebled profit and brought back
its 10 percent, although the upswing tailed off a bit
in the second half.
On the heavy side, Comeng overcame industrial troubles
to send pre-tax profit up 8 percent; higher tax clipped
the net result, yet the 15 percent payout
was very well covered . . . The unlisted Southern Portland
Cement maintained sales at a high Tate, but profits
declined heavily; a steady 8 percent was paid to BHP
and others.
Rationalising goes on at ACI, whose wholly owned
Bernard-Smith Co. and half-owned David Lennox
have been sold to Johns and Waygood Perry
Engineering . . . Canmaker Containers edged dividend
from 9 to 9£ percent on earnings up from
$1,967,195 to $2,193,140 . . . Aluminium fabricator
Overseas Corporation accelerated earnings during both
half-years, paid 13 percent for the second time, and
contemplates a l-for-5 bonus with the dividend unchanged.
To hosiery and handbags for Kolotex’s 64 percent
profit leap, an earning rate of 99.7 percent, and a
repeated 18 percent payout ... A more subdued
textiler, Minster will at last begin to make tufted carpets.
Soft-drink sales fizzed up 28.4 percent for
Schweppes and profits (on a comparable basis)
22 percent.
Transporter Mayne Nickless saw earnings go above
$1 million for the first time $1,114,496 to be precise
. . . Supplier to transporters, Freighters reversed
two years of falling sales, just on doubled profit,
and looks forward to a substantial sales increase for the
current year . . . Shipper Mcllwraith McEacharn appeared
more normal with a climb from $512,809 to $640,969.

THE LAND
Ricegrowers are chasing water,
and exports
AUSTRALIAN RICEG ROWERS
turned green last year when an export
order from the Philippines for 25,000
tons of rice went begging because they
simply had no rice to fill it. Water
permitting and really everything in
the industry hangs on that, because all
Australian rice is produced on irrigated
areas—the industry is determined not to
let it happen again. Not that it has
been slow to take advantage of the
world rice shortage and consequent big
rise in the price in the past few years.
Last year the Australian growers
notched up their sixth successive record
harvest with a crop of 217,000 tons
valued at a conservatively estimated $25
million (an increase of 7000 tons in
quantity and $3 million higher than the
$22 million realised for the 1967 crop).
These are the figures for rice produced
in the Riverina. Some was also pro-
duced in Western Australia and the
Northern Territory, but the quantity
was relatively insignificant and for some
obscure reason not available for publi-
cation.
About two-thirds of Australian rice
is produced in three designated irriga-
tion “areas”—Murrumbidgee, Coleam-
bally, and Murray—and most of the
remainder in the irrigation “districts”
in the same region. Total acreage
planted to rice in the region last year
was 76,000, an increase of 2311 acres
on the previous year. The actual
acreage is dependent on water allo-
cations as controlled by the N.S.W.
Water Conservation and Irrigation Com-
mission, which virtually has an over-
riding authority over the industry. But
the area handles its own crops through
the Ricegrowers’ Co-operative Mills.
Even with the more than doubling
of the value of the Australian rice
harvest in the past five years, this grain
still ranks near the bottom of the list
of the country’s cereals in value terms.
However, at least percentage wise it
stands as good a chance as any of fur-
ther building up its export trade. The
Food and Agriculture Organisation of
the United Nations has estimated that
world trade in rice will increase by 30
percent between now and 1975.
Although this figure could well be
reduced in the event of the plans of
some of the big Asian producers to
increase their acreages and yields corn-
ing to fruition, trade opinions vary on
the prospects in these directions, though
recent reports of a trebling of yield
being achieved by crossing Singapore
and Indonesian strains are indicative
of the possibilities that exist for step-
ping u p production by that route,
The immediate prospect for increas-
ing rice production in Australia is
focused firmly on the Riverina, where
yields are the highest in the world,
Although no figures are available for
rice production in the Northern Terri-
tory and W.A., at least prospects in
the N.T. are not considered propitious,
and, in fact, production is believed to
have dropped appreciably in the Darwin
area. With possibilities on the Ord still
problematical, the best hope for. rice
in the north of Australia would now
seem to be centred on the Burdekin
Valley region in Queensland on the
completion of the present water-storage-
construction program. Meanwhile, the
industry is redoubling its efforts to pro-
duce more rice in the Riverina under
the incentives of the present high world
piice for rice and the assured world
ou^ tS mo surpluses,
. Th ' N ' S ,; W - M ‘ nlstei ' J° r Conserva-
'■<>" has f 0 ™ h ‘ s confidence in *e
water-supply position —on which, of
coursej £ t ensi on of r i ce .growing in
the Riverina is uniquely dependent—
by recently agreeing to the establish-
ment of additional farms for rice-
growing in the Berrigan irrigation
“district” on a permanent basis, so
that there will now be 129 rice-
growing properties in the district:
Jerilderie (at its western extremity)
has 55, Deniliquin 55, Finlay eight,
Berrigan seven, and Tocumwal four.
However, despite strong representa-
tions, he turned down a local plea to
get 30-acre farms by limiting the size
to 20 acres albeit with provision for
increasing it later. Obviously the
Minister has had to proceed cautiously
in allowing the industry to expand
despite the greater availability of water.
For although the new farms will be
allowed to plant only 20 acres of rice,
those in the irrigation “areas” have
much bigger allocations—from 70 to
90 acres. (The “district” farms were
all developed on the basis of their dry
farming activities whereas the irriga-
tion “area” farms were created exclu-
sively for rice on land resumed by the
N.S.W. Government.)
What is more, the “area” farms get
a water allocation of from 800 to 1000
acre feet compared with only 443 acre
feet for the “district” farms. With the
further extension of rice-growing in the
“districts,” a distinction which has
already- become something of an
anachronism with the splitting up of
many “district” farms into smaller
irrigated properties could be hard to
sustain, at least in respect to water-
allocation differentials.
Anyway, the hegemony of the “area” -
growers would appear to be under
increasing challenge, because rice-
growers in the Berrigan irrigation “dis-
trict” have formed their own association,
whose voice is likely to be heard with
increasing force in industry discussions.
At any rate, it seems a good augury
for the further development of rice-
growing in the Riverina generally. For
one, Jerilderie growers (rice was grown
in the Jerilderie area for the first time
last year) are bound to press hard for
a lift in the size of farms to 30 acres,
as this was the target their rice-develop-
ment committee pressed for earlier this
year at Leeton before the industry’s
co-ordinating body.
There is a great attraction for
farmers in the area to get into rice-
growing, not only because of the good
returns offering on it (last year it
netted $42 a ton) but also because fat
lambs have been none too profitable
in recent years.

NO PLACE FOR WOMEN
WE MAY BE SURE of two things:
the first is that whatever happens we
will need more and better agricultural
scientists. We will need them to pro-
gress in times when progress is possible
and we will need them to survive as
things get worse and the world gets
hungrier. Secondly, we won’t get them,
because our society doesn’t encourage
this particular breed of scientists.. Be-

We're in the earth-moving business,
and the bigger the project the more
we like it. WABCO tractors, scrap-
ers, self-loading giant rigs, every-
thing up to super-size haulers that
carry 160 tons of earth and rocks,
can undertake tasks which seem

to take any chances about missing
scholarships or failing academic years
and that the risks are higher for
students taking the science courses than
the hu'manities.
This was frankly confirmed recently
by Professor F. Olsen, Director of
External Studies at Queensland Uni-
versity, when he told the Australian
Science Teachers’ Conference meeting
in Melbourne that there was a “huge
flight” of students away from the
sciences. He attributed the cause to
unreasonably high standards at univer-
sity and matriculation by the science
and maths examiners. The position was
further aggravated, he said, because
the number of teachers qualified to
teach matriculation science classes
properly was already insufficient to give
reasonable equality of opportunity to
students who wanted to go on to uni-
versity science courses. Like the pro-
verbial crow flying in circles of ever-
decreasing radius, the problem will dis-
appear when the flow of university
science graduates into teaching ceases.
This time is not very far off, appar-
ently. Only 19 percent of the country’s
teachers are graduates and ’most of
these hold degrees in the humanities.
Nevertheless, the Australian Institute
of Agricultural Science has set out on
what must be a vain and valiant drive
to recruit secondary-school students to
enter the agriculture faculties. To assist
its campaign it has published a com-
pletely revamped edition of its booklet
“Careers in Agricultural Science.”
Copies are to be widely disseminated
among the schools. Lavishly illustrated
on high-quality paper, the booklet
must have cost a tidy sum to print. The
cover picture shows a very photogenic
and highly nubile girl looking at a
rack of test-tubes, and the caption
claims that she is an agricultural scien-
tist examining samples of blood serum
from cattle. Setting aside the fact that
blood, except as “blood and bone” fer-
tiliser, is usually a medical or veterinary
interest, the picture surely implies that
pretty girls are welcome in the pro-
fession of agricultural science.
To anyone conversant with the pro-
fession, this is plainly untrue —regard-
less of whether the girls are comely or
homely. For one thing, agricultural
science is not concerned with appear-
ances; for another, it demands more
than most girls—especially if they are
nubile—can give. Competency in the
profession comes at the end of a long,
hard road that leaves few side-turnings
for babies and home-making. It does
not seem to be generally known that
agricultural scientists include a higher
percentage of people holding senior
<iegrees and postgraduate qualifications
than are to be found among medicos,
dentists, lawyers, and engineers.
If a girl perseveres to the end of
the academic rat-race, her nubility has
vanished. If she opts out temporarily,
she finds that she cannot re-enter the
orbit because of the exploding pace
of new findings, except at a most
handmaidenly level. No one has
bothered to take out figures showing
the percentage of female graduates
who are effectively practising agri-
cultural science a decade later, probably
because they are rarer than diamonds
in Coles. This man-run profession pre-
fers against them in salary, status, and
occupation. It only welcomes them as
overtrained technicians or as para-
scientists and to this extent the cover
picture’s portrayal is accurate.
The members of the Institute seem
to wear two faces. Over a quiet cup
of tea an agricultural scientist will tell
you that he hopes that none of his
children will follow in his footsteps.
Certainly, very few have. Publicly, his
zeal for what ought to be in any
properly ordered world no doubt causes
him to espouse recruitment, even to the
point of presenting the facts in a mis-
leading fashion. For instance, the
careers booklet starts with the unques-
tionable assertion that “agriculture is
of vital importance to Australia . . . the
very lifeblood of our nation.” Immedi-
ately after this preamble a statement on
salaries follows, and the first sentence
says that “salaries for agricultural
scientists show a steady increase . . .”
Once again the implication is false. The
Institute’s own surveys have consis-
tently shown that the earnings of
agricultural scientists lag well behind
those of almost all other professionals.
There is, however, scope for a small
proportion of self-employed agricultural
scientists, and these opportunities are
now being taken up. The incomes of
agricultural scientists in these positions
compare favorably with those of self-
employed graduates in other pro-
fessions. It is a small chance, but this
tail may eventually lash the dogs of
the Public Service Boards into grant-
ing more equitable pay cheques. Such
facts of the life of the agricultural
scientists should be honestly told to
naive schoolchildren.
If agricultural science was presented
to them as a kind of priesthood rather
than as a profession, an appealing, even
compelling, case could be made out
without resort to cloaking. Youngsters
could be told that they have only to
ask their parents to discover that when
they were children every little town
and neighborhood had its hunchback.
The drastic reduction of tuberculosis
in cattle and consequently in
humans as a result of the work
of Departments of Agriculture has
virtually removed this tragic disfigure-
ment from our population.
There are many such stories: each
farmer now produces about twenty
times as much food and fibre as his
counterpart of a generation ago. The
coming generation of farmers will have
to do at least as well if the country
is to stave off bankruptcy and feed the
clamoring hordes in the world beyond
these shores. It is difficult to decide
which is the greater national tragedy—
whether agricultural scientists are
underpaid or whether young people are
being seduced into an unhappy,
Cinderella profession.


INVESTMENT
The Markets
PEOPLE'S CAPITALISM,
OR SLAUGHTER
OF THE INNOCENTS?
MIMING ft SECURITY ANALYSIS • BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS ft THE MARKETS ft OIL TABLE
IT HAS not been an edifying per-
formance. Seeing the market being
manipulated by a band of professionals
while the ordinary “mug investor”
loses his shirt is not the sort of thing
to create great confidence in the future
of “people’s capitalism” the system
of public ownership in which the
ordinary man is supposed to be just
as much a shareholder in (and an
owner of) companies as the big men
of finance.
For, let’s face it, the market has
been manipulated silly in the past few
weeks. It would be a useful exercise
if the Stock Exchanges could see
just what proportion of the selling
orders that have knocked so many
stocks down on such small turnovers
have been genuine and how many have
been “short” selling. For even if this
short selling (selling a stock without
owning it in the hope of buying it
back at a lower price in a few days’
time) is only a small proportion of
the sales that have taken place, the
price falls it has produced have en-
couraged others to sell and have
multiplied the downward pressures on
stocks that may otherwise have sur-
vived quite well.
And there can be no doubt about
the instances of short selling; brokers
have been encouraging some of their
clients to do it; “technicians” who see
doom when a trendline breaks on a
graph have been jumping in to unload
what they own (along with a good
deal more they don’t) in a bout of
selling that, by its own momentum,
helps bring their own predictions into
practice. And there are suggestions
that brokers themselves have been sell-
ing short, acting as principal; the smiles
still shining in O’Connell Street sug-
gest that selling short is not a practice
that ended with Mr. Justice Street’s
condemnation of it in the recent cele-
brated case over a defaulting broker.
Is there a cogent defence of this
market behaviour that aims at manipu-
lating prices, that falsifies selling
pressures, that enables the experienced
market “operator” to profit at the ex-
pense of the amateur on whom such a
large part of the system depends? It
is said that the freer the market the
more likely it is to reflect reality; that
if some experts consider a stock’s price
should fall, the fact that they are not
holders of that stock should not prevent
them from backing that view, and
that this creates reality in markets.
And then there is the view that
markets are places where it is up to
the amateurs to make certain they do
not get out of their depth; that if
amateurs are going to play with fire,
then they must be prepared to get
burned.
That is utter nonsense; the boot is
on the other foot. If the market system
wants to use the amateurs as a source
of capital (and a useful source indeed
in recent times of raising big licks of
capital, for instance), then it is up to
the market system itself to provide an
offsetting degree of protection to the
amateurs against the sort of manipula-
tion they have had to put up with in
the past few weeks.
True, the “mug investor” has made
a lot of money during the boom; he
has ridden up with the nickels; he has
pursued rumors to their fitting con-
clusion (either upwards as with Great
Boulder to success or down to disaster
with such unimpressive performers as
Silver Valley). Even then, the pro-
fessionals, with their at times remark-
able industrial espionage systems that
seemed to know about many discoveries
before directors said they knew of them,
did better. There seems no doubt that
rules on the use of “insider” informa-
tion as tough as those now being tested
on Merrill Lynch in New York would
have made illegal a great deal of the
professional market activity that has
gone on in the past two years in
Australia.
The moral case in favor of trying
to create an honest market is over-
whelming in a society that encourages
ordinary people to play a shareholding
(and capital-providing) role. The big
question is whether such a market can
be created, anyway, and whether the
restraints that would be needed to keep
it “honest” wouldn’t stifle it so much
that it would lose a great deal of its
use. That is the question that “mug
investors,” who are watching their pro-
fits evaporating in front of their eyes,
can ponder over as the professionals,
who don’t care which way the market
goes as long as it moves, continue to-
kick the market down and down again,
encouraging the “mug investors” to get
in there and sell, too, before prices fall
further.
So the amateurs are just cannon-
fodder being led to destruction by the
very people who stand to gain most
from their destruction—at least in the
short term. And the professionals don’t
care much about the long-term impact
this sort of mauling has on the con-
fidence of the ordinary investor. They’ll
come back again; • they did after the
absurdities of the first oil boom, 14
years ago, or the uranium boom, and
they will after the pie-in-the-sky boom.
They always do. But is this the way to-
run our imitation of popular capitalism?
THE CHARTIST SAYS: THIESS HOLDINGS LTD. is an excellent
example of a long-term trendline study which now has “bearish” implications. A
large descending triangle formed during the area of trading between 1960 and 1963
with a downside break in 1964, resulting in a price decline to 25c. A base formed
and an uptrend commenced, which accelerated to a 200 percent appreciation rate
toward the end of 1967, with a peak of $5.10, after which the stock continued to
move sideways before reaching a final peak of $6.10 recently. However, the overall
picture now suggests the possibility of a fall down to $3,
which would test the lower 120 percent trendline, after
which the situation would call for reassessment. Last sale
price on 12/9/68 —$4.

of caution should be exercised. All
higher projections of stocks (for
example, Western Mining Corporation,
the Broken Hill Proprietary Company
Limited, and Mary Kathleen Invest-
ments) can now be discounted in the
short term in view of current market
action. Emphasis should be on any
break of an important trendline. Special
attention should also be placed on sup-
port and resistance levels.
And on BHP in particular the
Chartist says that selling pressure in
the past fortnight, which pushed the
shares down as low as a strong sup-
port level at $19.30, was followed with
some reaction to $22 before prices fell
back again below $2O. The situation
has become a “high risk” one.
The Cowan service, a long-term fan
of BHP, also warns that, short term,
its share price could ease and urges
traders to realise portion of their BHP
profits. It takes the view that not even
the good oil news from under the Bar-
racouta platform (with the second
strongest oil flow, at 3200 barrels a
day, BHP has yet had in Bass Strait,
despite the thinness of the sands) will
hold the shares up as projections, for
the company’s future earnings already
assume large additions to its oil
reserves.
For all the experts have to say,
I’m still convinced that a buyer of
BHP at any price below $2O is doing
very well indeed. Current prices may
not be exactly the bottom, but they
should be very close to it. And the
long-term rewards to come from getting
into BHP so cheaply should be signi-
ficant despite the difficult times it
clearly faces in its traditional steel
operations.
COAL
SCRAMBLE IN THE WEST
THE LONG and learned dissertations
on the coalmining industry issued in
recent times by stockbrokers in the
eastern States have been remarkable for
one thing: they have ignored com-
pletely the industry in Western Aus-
tralia, where there have been some
exciting investment opportunities (as
Speculator has already outlined in his
Diary when he bought some Western
Collieries a few weeks ago).
Developments being pioneered in
Australia are giving new life to the
W.A. coal industry. These are the allied
processes of beneficiation (increasing
the titanium dioxide content of
ilmenite out of beach sands, started by
Western Titanium) and metallising
(the process to be adopted by Hamers-
ley Iron for upgrading the iron content
of ore for direct feed, substituting for
scrap in certain forms of steelmaking.)
In this there has been a tremendous
scramble for markets. While tests are
starting, from September 18, in Canada
on a pilot process for Hamersley’s
Dampier plant, the coalmining firms


are seeking a way in to this new mar-
ket. And in Western Australia this has
brought companies and Government
into collision.
The Griffin Coal Mining Co. was in
the running for the Hamersley contract
following the success of its type of coal
in the Western Titanium operation. As
is usual in such matters that go slightly
beyond the limits of normal commerce
and become policy matters, negotiations
were being handled largely by the State
Government. However, Griffin tired of
the slow progress and revealed its whole
case, costs and all. From here on the
company was not working with the
same degree of Government blessing.
In Parliament earlier this month, the
Minister for Industrial Development,
Mr. Charles Court, said in reply to
Collie Labor man Mr. Tom Jones that
the economics of using Griffin’s Collie
coal for producing metallised agglomer-
ates were considerably less attractive
than those of using coal from other
sources. Hamersley and the Govern-
ment, he said, were trying to find ways
of closing the gap in cost between
Collie and Queensland coals.
This was followed by a statement by
Sir Maurice Mawby stating that no
decision had been taken, and that pro-
vided the coal was suitable the only
yardstick would be the cost. He added
that whether or not Collie coal would
be bought depended on the price it
could be landed at Dampier; this con-
tradicted Mr. Court’s claim that its
heat-producing element was the main
factor. The company also denied Mr.
Court’s assertion that, for heat-
producing ability, three tons of Collie
coal matched two of Queensland coal.
Griffin claim that if they can be given
a reasonable rail-freight rate between
Collie and Bunbury, and if loading
facilities are made available on a basis
similar to Queensland’s coalmining
facilities, they could hold their own.
On this the problem bogs down on
what comes first the new harbor
set-up at Bunbury that would make
sales and exports easier, or sales and
exports that would make the Bunbury
harbor extensions more easily justified.
CONGLOMERATES
SLATER WALKER'S RUSH
THE BREATHLESS rush of the
Slater Walker organisation into the
Australian scene—with its current
massive $lO million new issue soon to
be followed by the use of this cash in
further takeovers—has been little short
of astounding. But its Australian opera-
tions have only been a side-issue to the
serious business of cutting a swathe
through the British financial estab-
lishment.
Last weekend Mr. Jim Slater went
on holiday, after a hectic summer which
culminated in an agreement for his
Slater Walker Securities to buy Sir
Isaac Wolfson’s financial holding com-
pany, Drage’s—for shares and loan
stock with subscription rights. In the
previous four months SW had taken
over Crittall Hope, Britain’s largest
maker of metal windows, sold off some
of its money-losing overseas companies,
sold to GEC Keith Blackman, a maker
of electric fans bought only a few
months before, made a spectacularly
successful public issue of units in the
Invan unit trust, announced half-year
pre-tax profits up from £348,000 to
£1.6 million, bought Carden Withers, a
sizable Bahamas-based bank, for shares,
and also Television West and Wales,
rich in cash but deprived of its tele-
vision licence—and denied that SW
was having anything to do with British
Electric Traction.
The stock market was so bemused by
all this activity that it has put the SW
shares up only 4s to 91s 9d since the
Drage’s bid to make them nearly four
times their low of 22s this year, and
to give the group a market value
(including loan stock) of over £lOO
million. Yet all these actions fit into
the Slater idea of getting at assets whose
full value can be realised, either in the
short term for cash, or in a longer
term by improving earnings through
better management. The time-scale
must not be too long (Blackman was
sold for that very reason). He may
even go on to sell companies whose
profits he has built up.
Mr. Slater’s open ambition is to head
as big a conglomerate as the American
Litton Industries. It is to his advan-
tage that British management is worse
than American, so bargains are more
frequent, and assets rarely fully utilised
•- or even appreciated.
Now he has Sir Isaac’s millions
behind him.
So Mr. Slater will have up to £3O
million to play with, what with the
cash from TWW and the sale of Keith
Blackman. It would be logical for him
to use it to help pay for another major
industrial company. And it is an open
secret that there are three in engineer-
ing to which Mr. Slater thinks he could
apply his management techniques to
spectacular profit. These are Allied
Ironfounders, Vickers, and Tube Invest-
ments, all with the requisite mixture
of good and bad divisions, all (except
possibly Vickers) with enough under-
lying management for the good bits to
be highly profitable by themselves. And
the market values are not unreasonable.
Allied Ironfounders, at £37 million,
may even be too small, but Vickers at
£B7 million looks right—and Vickers’
shares in International Computers and
British Aircraft Corporation will be
more easily salable because of the
present reorganisation wave. And since
Mr. Slater has never been modest in
his ambitions, even Tube Investments,
at £127 million, may not be too big for
him.
With these companies having sub-
stantial Australian interests, it seems
likely that the Australian arm of Slater
Walker may well be inheriting some
side-effects of its parent’s predatory
instincts in the not too distant future.
WESTERN AUSTRALIA
CEMENT BOOM
SOME readers of an item on this page
on August 10 about Cockbum Cement,
the successful Western Australian
operator, may, through misreading,
have got the wrong impression that
Cockburn’s parent company, Rugby
Portland Cement of the U.K., had
been buying its subsidiary’s shares in the
market. The item stated: “British
investors are familiar with Cockburn’s
parent, Rugby Portland Cement, which
owns 85 percent of the Australian
company’s shares, and are believed to
have soaked up a considerable number
of the 1.8 million 50-cent shares which
were placed with Australian investors
at $1.60 in July, 1967, making for an
even greater shortage of scrip here.”
This “soaking up” obviously refers to
British investors, not Rugby Cement.

BOOMING BOWRA
THE SHARE PRICE of Chamberlain

ward since a record profit was
announced despite a so-so agricultural
season should take along with it Bowra

Bowra set records also in the past year
—sales a record $1.79 million, up from
$1.53 million; profit after tax up to
$98,000 from last year’s $90,000. Direc-
tors say business in the current year
is heading toward even higher figures.
For Chamberlains, interest in the com-

spreads from Kalgoorlie to Cape York
to King Island in the Bass Strait. The
company has not been formed in haste,
with prospecting authorities as its only
assets, but has already done quite a lot
of work on most of its leases. The most
immediately prospective of these is the
area held at Kings Plains, some 20
miles south of Cooktown, in northern
Queensland, where a considerable
deposit of tin-bearing ore has been posi-
tively established. But the main reason
for immediate market interest is no
doubt due to its interests in Western
Australia, where it holds a total of
fourteen mining claims, all close to the
railway line, 34 miles east of Kal-
goorlie.
These claims cover the western end
of a magnetic anomaly which runs in
a direction slightly north of east. A
shaft 20ft. deep has encountered a
shear zone carrying copper and nickel
sulphides which, over a width of 12
inches, assayed 2.72 percent copper and
0.58 percent nickel. Farther north, 40
miles north-west of Leonora, the com-
pany also encountered samples assay-
ing between 0.14 and 0.87 percent
nickel from a surface outcrop running
along the surface of a 300-acre mining
claim. The company is conducting an
induced polarisation survey over this
whole area and a similar survey is
planned for the mining claims closer to
Kalgoorlie once this is completed.
At Kings Plains it has already
established reserves of 74 million cubic
yards of tin-bearing wash containing an
average of 5.60 z. of tin per cubic
yard, of which 29 million cu. yds. grades
at 7oz. of tin per yard. Drilling to
date has been fairly extensive, covering
over 300 drill holes, and has shown
that the deposit stretches over six miles
and has yet to be completely defined.
It appears fairly certain that the ground
can be profitably worked, as the grades
compare quite well with those of
Ravenshoe Tin (6.80 z.) and Tableland
Tin (6.350 z.). The actual tin-bearing
wash lies under a considerable amount
of barren overburden some 40-50 ft.
deep and the feasibility of the project at
current market prices relies on the
company’s ability to find a method of
stripping this overburden at very low
cost. On present proved reserves, the
life of the deposit is probably not long
enough to carry the high write-offs in-
volved in a level of capital expenditure
high enough to achieve a low enough
overburden, but this could well change
once the known extensions to the ore-
body have been proved. The company
said in its prospectus that further re-
serves could be found containing at
least 30 million cu. yds. averaging
4.70 z. of tin per ton.
Another part of the company’s pros-
pects will also (if successful) encompass
large-volume low-grade dredging. At
Moreton Bay, the company holds three
leases on the inner side of Moreton
Island. It has not yet drilled the sands
in this area, so this particular prospect
remains nothing more than that. How-

Chairman’s Address
Extract from Sir Colin Syme's
Address at the Annual General
Meeting held at South Melbourne
on Friday, 6th September, 1968
Results of Operations
For 1967/68 consolidated net profit of the
Group was $47.2 million which was $4.5
million or 10 percent better than the con-
solidated net profit for the previous year.
This result was arrived at after deducting
estimated liability for income tax calcu-
lated at the basic rate of percent.
Since the accounts were finalised, the
rate of income tax has been increased to
45 percent, which increases by
$1,550,000 the estimated tax payable by
the Group in respect of the year under
review. Had this occurred before the
accounts were completed, net profit for
the year would have been correspond-
ingly reduced. The actual under pro-
vision will now be taken up in the Profit
& Loss Appropriation Account next year.
On a pre-income tax basis we actually
made $1.5 million less profit this last
year than in the previous year, despite
the fact that steel production was some
4 percent higher in the later year. The
improvement in the consolidated net
profit results from a reduction in income
tax provision by $6 million and this
reduction resulted very largely from
greater investment allowances and to a
lesser extent from increased deductions
for mining calls.
Your Board is disappointed that con-
solidated trading profit did not show a
greater improvement. Its failure to do so
was partly due to the fact that local
demands for steel was at a lower level
in the second half of the year. To the
extent that Australian demand was
affected by drought, this situation should
improve and in fact has already im-
proved over the last few months. But
there are other factors the effects of
which are less transient. Costs increased
materially during the year and seem
certain to increase further. A large part
of the actual and anticipated increases
arises from higher employment costs. In
the case of coal, cost increases are accen-
tuated by the difficult mining conditions
encountered in many of our collieries. In
the case of iron ore, the quantity drawn
from Western Australia increased during
the year and will increase further in the
future. Delivered at Port Kembla and
Newcastle, the cost of Western Australian
ore is, of course, much higher than that
of South Australian ore.
Despite the slackness of local demands,
we were able to continue production of
most products at capacity levels, but only
by the use of export markets. I have
referred on previous occasions to the
world excess of steel capacity over steel
consumption. If anything, this situation
has become worse.
Income Tax
The Directors’ Report deals with the
present position of the litigation between
the Company and the Commissioner of
Taxation. If Mr. Justice Kitto’s judg-
ment is upheld by the Full High Court,
it will mean substantial taxation savings
in respect of the cost of development of
the Mt. Newman iron ore deposits. It
will also result in a refund of something
over $1.5 million paid by B.H.P., and
A.I.S., in respect of past assessments
where developments other than Mt. New-
man were involved.
Subsequent to Mr. Justice Kitto’s judg-
ment being handed down, the Income
Tax Assessment Act, as it applies to
mining companies, was amended effective
from 9th May last. Generally, the
changes appear likely to add consider-
ably to the future income tax liabilities
of the Company, although in some im-
portant respects the measure of the dis-
advantage caused by the amendments will
depend on the outcome of the appeals
to the Full High Court.
In recent years, we and others have
entered into a number of major com-
mitments with Governments involving
development of mineral deposits in re-
mote parts of Australia. These have
entailed large capital expenditures for
the dredging of approach channels, turn-
ing basins and shipping berths, all of
which are essential. The facilities so pro-
vided do not become the property of the
producer and are available for general
public use. The shouldering by private
enterprise of responsibilities for such
developments has relieved Governments
of what, under normal circumstances,
would be regarded as their respon-
sibilities. It has speeded up, and in many
cases has made possible, the provision
of deepwater harbors where there were
none or where the facilities were in-
adequate. By its amending Act, the
Federal Government has decided that
future dredging expenditure of this
nature will not qualify in any way for
any income tax allowance or deduction.
In our view, this decision is wrong in
principle and not conducive to the best
development of Australia’s resources.
Liquid Position
The Company’s financial position at the
close of the year, whilst satifactory, is
marked by a lower level of liquidity than
previously, reflecting the very high
capital expenditure in which we have
been and continue to be engaged.
In order to raise further necessary funds
the Directors decided this morning to
offer to shareholders approximately
9,228,000 shares at a premium of $3 per
share (that is $5 per share in total),
in the proportion of one share for each
14 shares held at the date books are
closed. That date, which is unlikely to
be earlier than late November, together
with all other details of the issue, will
be announced as soon as possible.
In addition, the Directors decided to offer
t°. staff officers who have certain
minimum service qualifications, on the
same terms, up to a total of 200,000
shares. Details of this arrangement have
yet to be finalised, but will provide that
the number of shares which will be avail-
able to any officer will be determined on
a graduated scale between a minimum of
20 and a maximum of 200 shares. This
offer to staff will not apply to Directors.
Steel Marketing Conditions
Despite high levels of investment in new
plants, modernisation of previously in-
stalled equipment and a vigorous pro-
gramme for improving efficiency, the
Company continued to be affected by
rising costs. Comparing the last quarter
of our 1967 year with the corresponding
quarter of this year, our employment
costs rose by 8.9 percent per employee
and by 6.2 percent per ton of raw steel.
These increases which applied fairly
generally throughout the community add
heavily to the cost structure of the
Group, not only through increased em-
ployment costs, but also through higher
prices of goods and services acquired
from suppliers outside the Group.
The world surplus in steel capacity to-
which I referred earlier has had marked
effects on the pattern and terms of in-
ternational trade in steel. The first of
these effects has been the cumulative
weakening in the price of steel exported
to countries which have insufficient in-
digenous production. The second has
been a marked increase in low priced
sales to countries which have adequate
domestic production, resulting in
pressures on the price structure of the
traditional producers in the importing
country. We are involved in both of
these effects and a significant proportion
of the Australian market growth, especi-
ally for sheets and strip, has been cap-
tured by imported material traded under
terms which express the current state
of world trade and not the relative costs
of production.
Continued on page 61


A further aspect which worsens the
position is that in some cases Australian
steel and manufactured goods made from
Australian steel are unable, by reason
of non-tariff trade barriers, to secure
access to home markets of some overseas
producers who are penetrating the Aus-
tralian domestic market.
Capital Expenditure
Although in the twelve months to May a
record $148 million was spent on capital
developments, some $17 million of this
amount was spent as our proportion of
oil and gas expenditure. If our share of
the Mt. Newman expenditure, namely
$26 million, was also excluded, the figure
would be $105 million.
We were particularly pleased at the good
start made by the iron ore pellet plant
at Whyalla, and present indications are
that its output will exceed its designed
capacity. The Company has a $104
million contract to export 10 million
tons of iron pellets to Japan between
now and 1976, and approximately 50
percent- of this will be carried in Aus-
tralian Flag ships which include our
latest 55,000 ton bulkship “Iron Hunter,”
launched at Whyalla in June.
Shipping
The high cost of shipping between Aus-
tralian ports is a matter of great concern
to us and materially affects our ability to
meet competition from overseas pro-
ducers. The shipping cost of sending iron
ore from Western Australia to Japan is
significantly less than the cost of send-
ing iron ore from Western Australia to
New South Wales. Although the com-
parison is not so striking, a similar
problem arises in relation to the ship-
ment of steel products. The conditions
under which coastal shipping are re-
quired to operate substantially or entirely
offset the advantage which should arise
from the lesser distances which need to
be covered.
Much attention is being given to this
aspect of our business, but it is not a
problem which can be solved by private
enterprise alone.
Shipbuilding
The efficient operation of the Whyalla
Shipyard was for most of the year
impeded by shortages of key types of
labor. Largely on this account, but also
because of other cost increases, financial
results from fixed price contracts were
most unsatisfactory. Since the close of
the year the labor shortages have been
less acute.
Mt. Newman Venture
Good progress has continued on the Mt.
Newman iron ore project. Expenditure
on first-stage development still looks like
being close to the estimate of $188 mil-
lion, of which our share is 30 percent.
The Mt. Newman Joint Venturers have
contracts to supply Japanese steel mills
with 100 million tons of ore between
1969 and 1984 and also 70 million tons
to our Company, commencing in 1970.
Recently, additional contracts have been
negotiated to supply 2.5 million tons of
high grade ore and 1 million tons of
low grade ore to Japan in 1969 and
1970.
A further 5 million tons of low grade ore
will be supplied over 10 years commenc-
ing 1970/71.
Oil and Natural Gas Development
The combined expenditure of Esso and
ourselves on oil and natural gas explor-
ation and development in the areas in
which we are mutually interested, from
the commencement of work to 30th June,
amounts to approximately $73 million,
and a lot more money has to be spent
before any revenue will be obtained.
Because of the terms of our agreements
with Esso, the great bulk of the cost of
exploration work has been borne by that
company so that our expenditure is a
good deal less than one half of the $73
million. However, the initial development
expenditure of which we pay half will
include a further $210 million, made up
of $31 million for the Gippsland Gas
Processing Plant, and $24 million for the
Long Island Point Fractionation Plant,
on top of offshore expenditure exceeding
$93 million and pipelines costing in the
order of $62 million. In addition to this
initial expenditure, it is likely that
further investment of the order of $55
million will be required to complete the
overall development plans for the Marlin,
Barracouta, Halibut, and Kingfish fields
to cater for anticipated production re-
quirements after production commences.
An important factor in seeking a skilled
and experienced partner in this venture
was our realisation that exploration and
development was going to call for tech-
nical resources of a very high order.
The wisdom of this decision has been
amply borne out by events. The develop-
ment of oil and gas fields in deep water
is still a relatively new field of know-
ledge and Esso and the various specialised
contractors are working at the frontiers
of technology in waters which provide
some of the worst conditions in the world
for this type of work. When Esso began
drilling in Bass Strait in 1964 in terms
of our agreement with them, no oil field
in the world had been developed in
water deeper than 210 feet. It was not
until 1967 that the 250-foot mark in
offshore development was passed for the
first time. The depth of the water over
the Kingfish field is 250 feet and the
pipeline connecting the field to shore will
be the largest ever to be laid in these
depths and in the prevailing sea con-
ditions. In our view, Esso and the off-
shore contractors have done and are
doing an outstanding job.
Discoveries of crude oil in Australia to
date leave us a long way from achieving
the goal of self-sufficiency and, taking the
history of oil exploration throughout the
world as a guide, it should not be
expected that it will be achieved rapidly
or without very great expense, and there
will probably be periods when the results
are discouraging.
A matter almost as important as the
quantity of recoverable crude oil which
is discovered is the price which the crude
oil is likely to bring. Crude oil is of no
value to Australia while it remains in the
ground undiscovered and undeveloped.
The great need at present is to intensify
the rate of exploration and, hopefully, of
discovery. The principle of an incentive
element , in the price for crude oil is one
method of attracting the very large
amount of risk capital that is required,
and we believe it has merit, but there are
also other means of ensuring that the
rewards available to those who take the
risks—and succeed—are sufficient to
attract investment at a desirable rate.
Whatever basis is adopted, we do not
believe that locally produced crude oil
should be expected to compete with the
very low-priced supplies available to
refiners in Australia from the enormous
fields of the Middle East and Libya, with
which hardly any other country’s indige-
nous production can compete.
Until some substantial measure of self-
sufficiency is attained in Australia, it
seems to us that a modest premium in
the price for locally produced crude oil is
well justified, and we do not consider this
need necessarily result in higher fuel
prices to the consumer unless the Govern-
ment considers that course to be prefer-
able to other alternatives available to it.
Self-sufficiency would bring obvious
benefits in the saving of foreign exchange
and the security of supply. There are,
however, equally tangible, if less obvious,
benefits. When oil is produced in Aus-
tralia, the development and production
costs are largely spent in this country.
Taxes and royalties accrue to Australian
Governments, both Commonwealth and
State, instead of to host Governments in
overseas producing countries.
In our case, more than one-half of
profits befqre deduction of taxes and
royalties will in due course be. paid to
Governments to the benefit of the Aus-
tralian community, in satisfaction of these
obligations.
In the field of by-products, a marketing
team from Hematite Petroleum Pty. Ltd.
recently toured much of South-East Asia
and the Pacific area to investigate the
possibility of L.P.G. sales. Following a
detailed review of South-East Asian mar-
kets, the company has entered into dis-
cussions with Bridgestone Liquefied Pet-
roleum Gas Company Limited of Japan
to explore the possibility of a long-term
L.P.G. marketing arrangement. L.P.G.
production from the Long Island Point
Fractionation Plant is expected to reach
half a millions tons per year by the end
of 1970, and Hematite will market half
of this quantity.
International Developments
For some years past we have been
looking for suitable opportunities to en-
gage in manufacturing activities outside
Australia. Several avenues, which at first
sight looked promising, have turned out
to be unattractive on further investiga-
tion. Currently, we are closely studying
some projects which we are hopeful will
materialise. One of these, through Titan
Manufacturing Co. Pty. Ltd., is to engage
in the manufacture of tungsten carbide
products in Taiwan. Another is for Com-
monwealth. Steel Co. Ltd. to join with
local interests in the Philippines to engage
in the manufacture of steel grinding balls
in that country, to serve the needs of its
expanding mining industry.

ever, the whole area has a history of
heavy mineral concentration (rutile,
ilmenite, zircon) and the company’s
consulting geologist has suggested that
these heavy minerals, which are the
remnants of a once more extensive
deposit, have been washed away into
the sea on either side of the existing
islands. On the ocean side of such
islands, mineral deposits are replenished
and concentrated by the wave action of
the ocean, whilst on the inland side,
which is protected from this wave
action, there is little replenishment of
heavy mineral concentrations. Never-
theless, the company’s consulting
geologist suggests that there still should
be heavy mineral sands deposited in
Moreton Bay which have been covered
with a fair depth of mud and other
residue.
At Mount Painter, in South Austra-
lia, where the Exoil/Transoil group has
been able to establish over one million
tons of ore containing about 21b. of
uranium per ton, Mid-Eastern Minerals
also holds a lease. So far, this does
not seem a particularly promising area
for a continuation of the ores which
Exoil has proved and which are sub-
economic at current and near-term
likely prices, but the scintillometer sur-
veys which are to be flown should give
a fairly quick indication of the poten-
tial of this area. Nevertheless, the area
could certainly contain other minerals
apart from uranium.
The gold leases held are all in Vic-
toria, one prospect covering the possible
extension of the very rich deep leads
which were the main source of the
goldrushes at Ballarat and Bendigo,
while two other prospects are aimed
more at finding virgin orebodies near
the surface which could be amenable
to open-cut extraction. So far, results
on these areas have not been too
promising.
The company was formed in July
to acquire the mineral interests of
Mid-Eastern Oil N.L. and is the second
mineral (as opposed to oil) company
which Mid-Eastern has sponsored. In
August last year it sponsored the for-
mation of Great Northern Mining (to
develop a tin mine in north Queens-
land) and shareholders were also given
a priority to take up shares in that
company. The latest spin-off itself
follows similar moves in recent months
by Magellan Petroleum and has been
followed by Longreach Oils’ flotation
of Longreach Metals, a company
formed to look after the minerals activi-
ties of that group.
This type of issue is likely to con-
tinue. The growing number of mineral
prospects turned up by oil exploration
companies in their drilling activities
has led to more and more inconvenience
in the apportionment of call moneys
paid on shares as between funds for
oil prospecting on the one hand and
mineral prospecting on the other;
existing legislation in some cases has
had the effect of limiting the tax de-


ductibility which has been very neces-
sary for the attraction of venture capi-
tal. It can be expected that there will
be similar moves by other oil com-
panies should their current rate of ex-
penditure on mineral exploration con-
tinue to grow. Timor Oil and the Exoil-
Transoil group seem to be obvious
illustrations.
NEVER BEFORE in Australia’s his-
tory has so much money been spent on
the search for minerals and metals. And
the big increase in exploratory effort is
likely to result in big new discoveries.
But who will benefit? True, there are
many Australian listed companies
presently engaged in the search, with
varying prospects of success. But many
of these appear far less likely to end
up with workable deposits than some
explorers about whose efforts little is
known.
These are the many giant inter-
national companies that are taking a
very active role indeed in the search
for metals and minerals in Australia.
Not all of them are working entirely
away from the public’s gaze; some
have joint efforts with Australian com-
panies, like Anaconda with Conzinc
Riotinto of Australia and New Broken
Hill, or like International Nickel with
BHP, or Freeport with Metals Explor-
ation. But most of them are working
strictly on their own, spending fortunes
on the very real prospect of finding
something.
Apart from Utah in coal, none of
these foreign companies has yet come
np with a major commercial propo-
sition that it has announced it will
develop on its own. However, it is
likely that many of them have pros-
pects that are in far more advanced
stages of assessment than many highly
rated and well-publicised prospects held
by local companies. It would be a test
of government policy if these foreign
groups decided to go ahead and develop
prospects on their own without offer-
ing Australian participation. But the
pressures for allowing an Australian
stake in such developments would be
overwhelming.
So it is likely that there could well
be some significant joint ventures of
this nature in coming years. And since
these will presumably require large
amounts of capital, it seems that the
local companies most likely to share in
such developments would be those that
had access to the local market on a
large scale, particularly while restraints
exist on the export of capital from
the U.S. and U.K. This gives an
added attraction to the leading min-
ing stocks like CRA, the Barriers, Con-
solidated Goldfields, BHP, CSR, Peko-
Wallsend, and some of the larger gold-
miners.
Names like Laporte, Pickands
Mather, Continental Oil (which already
has a large phosphate find), Anglo-
American, Kennecott, Conwest, New-
mont, and Homestake, to list a few,
keep cropping up on mining leases all
over Australia. And many private pros-
pectors inundate the Australian head-
quarters of these groups with offers of
participation in “prospects.” So far
there is no evidence of exactly how
much these major international ex-
plorers are spending in Australia, but
it is likely that they would be match-
ing the amount being spent by Aus-
tralian companies listed on the Stock
Exchanges, some of whom appear to
be limiting their exploratory work to
the minimum survey that a geological
firm will undertake.

COOL AIR WILL BRING
DELIGHT TO THE
KELVINATOR FAITHFUL
UNITED STATES conglomerates,
Australian oil developments, and long
hot summers seem to have little in
common. That’s what I thought until
I took another look at Kelvinator Aus-
tralia. Then the combination spelt out
solid profit growth ahead. The share
markets’ rejected darling is set for a
big reconciliation with her fickle suitors
who sold out at the first sign of
trouble back in late 1965, helping
to reduce the price/earnings ratio from
a high of 18.3 in 1964 to 13.2 in 1965,
and a current figure of 10.1 after heavy
selling last April. The faithful who
stayed with Kelvinator can get ready
for their reward.
Since its incorporation in 1934, when
Mechanical Products was reorganised,
10 percent of Kelvinator Australia’s
capital has been held by the Kelvinator
Appliance Division of American Motor
Corporation. Now that White Con-
solidated Industries has bought the Kel-
vinator Appliance Division, the Aus-
tralian company’s U.S. link has a
broader base.
White Consolidated originated as
White Sewing Machines in 1926 and
was the second largest sewing-machine
manufacturer in the United States.
When the Japanese took over as the
world giants in sewing machines, White
ceased manufacture in the United States
and commenced to import Japanese
machines. In the ’sixties, White Con-
solidated embarked on a merger pro-
gram that has made the company a
major force in United States industry.
Between 1965 and 1967, net sales rose
from $U.5.45.728 million to
SU.S. 172.674 million, and net income
from $U.5.2.092 million to SU.S. 11.247
million. But this growth was only a
drop in the bucket compared to devel-
opments over the last 12 months. In
October, 1967, White acquired Hupp
Co. and in May, 1968, Blaw-Knox was
added to the group, whilst the Bullard
Co. succumbed to a takeover bid in
April, 1968.
The net result of the mergers with
Blaw-Knox and Hupp alone has been
a snowballing increase in group sales
to $U.5.548.361 million, total assets hav-
ing jumped to $U.5.493.287 million and
net income to $U.5.19.801 million. An
approximate threefold sales rise, a
doubling of assets, and net income
around SU.S.2O million is jet-set type
growth, White also picked up the Kel-
vinator Appliance Division and the
Franklin Division of Studebaker Wor-
thington Corp. in 1967-68, which means
sales are now running at SU.S.BOO mil-
lion per annum, of which $U.5.300 mil-
lion is in appliances. The group is
currently No. 5 in appliances after
General Electric, Frigidaire, Whirlpool,
and Westinghouse.
White is now very much a con-
glomerate and is strong not only in
appliances but also in machine tools,
foundry equipment, textile and packag-
ing machinery, with the Hupp range
including motor-vehicle parts, air-
conditioning, and heating equipment.
These products make up the balance
of White’s sales. The association of the
U.S. conglomerate with Kelvinator Aus-
tralia can only be beneficial as it could
give the local company access to the
full range of the White group’s
products.
The second bull point in Kelvinator
Australia’s chart is meters, for use in all
phases of the booming oil industry.
A. O. Smith meters are marketed in
Australia by the Wayne Pump sub-
sidiary of Kelvinator, and the product
enjoys a reputation in the oil industry
of being of very advanced design. Kel-
vinator has a full meter range available
to cater for all demands from offshore
drillings rigs to petrol tankers. I have
been told that each drilling platform
requires at least twelve meters, with a
further twelve for every pipeline, and
two inlet and outlet meters per storage
and tower terminal, which seems to
mean a large market indeed when Aus-
tralian oil production hits its peak.
Room air-conditioning units are
giving Kelvinator another rapid growth
market. Total Australian production
was 22,000 units in the 1967 calendar
year, and industry forecasts for 1968
indicate a market of 35,000. By 1972,
Australian homes and offices are ex-
pected to take 75,000 window air-
conditioners. Yet even this figure may
be conservative, as it is based on current
sales to private homes. The key prob-
lem for the industry is getting the first
unit into a home against moderate
consumer resistance. United States’
experience has shown that, after the
first installation in the master bedroom,
families decide to equip other bedrooms
and even install the plant in the kitchen!
Projected 1972 output for Australia is
geared to current difficulties in per-
suading a family to take one unit.
When initial resistance is overcome, the
“two or more unit” family is likely to

develop. An interesting element in the
present Australian market is its unusual
geographical pattern. Sales per capita
are highest in South Australia, while
Queensland demand lags well behind
all other States. Kelvinator has approxi-
mately 45 percent of the total Aus-
tralian market, is more than maintain-
ing its position, and the company’s
future in cool air seems particularly
bright.
Even the traditional product line of
domestic refrigerators, once Kel-
vinator’s main profit-earner, should
come good again. Domestic appli-
ances, including room air-conditioners,
contribute about 50 percent of the
company’s group profit, with industrial
products (meters, petrol pumps,
plastic products, industrial cooling)
making up the balance. Ground has
been lost to Email and other com-
panies in sales of domestic refrigerators,
resulting in Kelvinator slipping from
its 1963 position as industry leader with
19 percent of total Australian sales to
the 1967 level, when the company
ranked number two with a market
share of just over 12 percent. Email
is now in front, due mainly to a
technological lead in frost-free develop-
ment. Malleys, General Electric, and
Frigidaire each have about 12 percent
of the market also, and are close behind
Kelvinator in a very competitive
industry.
But don’t write the company off in
refrigerators. The toughest competitor
in the domestic-appliance industry is
always the manufacturer who fights
back when his sales have dropped.
Kelvinator has the financial and tech-
nological resources to come up again
and is being closely watched by its
competitors.

Tax to pre-tax profit has been con-
sistently high in recent years, as Kel-
vinator has followed a conservative tax
provision policy and no doubt built up
good hidden reserves in the process.
The 1968 tax provision is reduced
following a Taxation Department ruling
that tax need not be paid on funds set
aside as a provision for warranty on
products manufactured. Over the next
five years tax previously paid on pro-
vision for warranty can also be
recovered.
Summary: Kelvinator has had its
problems, but I expect good profit
growth in the future. The 50-cent
shares are priced at $1.85 and are
yielding 4.1 percent. Price earnings
ratio is 10.1. At this price they look
a good buy for growth.

THE POLITICS
WHICH MAKE
HOLLAND TICK
By ERNEST BRAMSTED
The Politics of Accommodation.
Pluralism and Democracy in the
Netherlands. Arend Lijphart. Univer-
sity of California Press. $6.70.
VISITORS TO the pleasant garden-
city of Hilversum, half an hour’s train
journey from Amsterdam, discover that
all the Dutch radio and television trans-
mitters and studios of Holland are
stationed there. And they divide not
on commercial or non-commercial lines
but on lines of religion and Party
politics. One station is “General,” an-
other Catholic, a third Calvinist, the
fourth Liberal Protestant, and, last but
not least, a fifth Socialist. All of the
stations are State-owned, but none of
them is operated by the State. The
programs are run by private organisa-
tions with a large membership who pay
dues. In fact, this division of important
mass-media corresponds roughly to the
traditional power-blocs of the country,
each of which has its own ideology and
political organisation. Yet, in spite of
these marked lines of religious and
political division, Holland has proved a
stable parliamentary democratic society
and functions better than many other
States in Europe.
In this book Mr. Lijphart, an Ameri-
can political scientist of Dutch extrac-
tion, attempts to analyse this paradox.
He ably describes the three or four
power-blocs which make up the political
and social landscape of the Netherlands
and discusses the politics of accommoda-
tion which make this pluralistic society
tick. Among the major denomina-
tions the Roman Catholic element
has grown in recent years and now
forms 40.4 percent of the population.
Its counterpart in politics, the Catholic
Party, has played an increasing role
in post-war Governments and has re-
peatedly provided a Prime Minister.
On the other hand, the Calvinist and
Protestant groups (37.6 percent of the
total nation) are still playing their
traditional role in politics and are
represented by two political groups,
the Anti-Revolutionary Party and the
Christian-Historical Party. In the secu-
lar field you have the Liberal Party
and the much larger and more influen-
tial Socialist Party, which, like its
Catholic competitor, usually polls about
30 percent of the total vote. Together
these five Parties fill 90 percent of the
150 seats in the Second Dutch Cham-
ber. The four power-blocs are also
fully represented in the Dutch trade-
union movement, although only 40 per-
cent of the Dutch workers are members.
It is, perhaps, not surprising that the
Socialist Trade Union is the largest
and that its Catholic competitor takes
second place; more unusual is the
existence of a Protestant Trade Union
comprising over 15 percent of organised
labor. Holland shares the fact that it
has State schools as well as schools run
by various religious denominations
with many other pluralist societies,
including those of U.S.A. and Australia,
but it is startling that there a person
can be educated from kindergarten to
the study for a Ph.D. in a school ox-
university of his own religious per-
suasion. In addition to the nine general
non-denominational centres of tertiary
education there exist a Free Calvinist
University, a Catholic University, and
a Catholic Institute of Economics.
What is more, even at the public
universities most student clubs are
organised on a bloc basis.
Altogether, the organisation of Dutch
society oh these bloc lines, which
extends to employers’, farmers’, and
retailers’ associations, is, in the words
of the author, “much more thorough
and the interpenetration of Parties,
interest groups, and communication
media reaches much farther than in
Anglo - American and Scandinavian
countries,” and, we might add, than in
Australia, too.
Yet the leaders of the four blocs
have constantly pursued a policy of
compromise, of agreeing to disagree, of
give and take. If this policy of accom-
modation has been successful, it has, in
my opinion, something to do with two
factors which Lijphart leaves un-
mentioned.
The one is the fact that Holland has
been traditionally largely a trading-
nation sandwiched between two to three
major Powers; the other is the phleg-
matic Dutch temperament, inclined to
favor the middle of the road and any
businesslike unsentimental arrange-
ments. In this context some of the
tables in the book are interesting.
People in five countries—Holland, Ger-
many, Great Britain, Italy, and U.S.A.
—were asked to indicate the qualities
they admire most from a given list. The
percentage of Dutch people questioned
who chose “Respectful, does not over-
step his place,” was about twice as
high as that in Britain, Italy, and the
U.S.A., and, surprisingly, nearly four
times as high as in Germany. The
quality “Ambitious, wants to get ahead”
was marked as a top quality by double
or nearly double the number of Dutch
people compared with their German,
British, and American opposite num-
bers. On the other hand, “Generosity
and considerateness” were chosen by
fewer Dutchmen than by their corres-
pondents in the other countries. Only
12 percent of the Dutch sample favored
this quality compared with 44 percent
in Britain, 39 percent in the United
States, and 26 percent in Germany. In
Italy the ratio was similarly low (14
percent).
No society stands still. Strongly
embedded as the traditional attitudes
are in Holland, there have been indica-
tions of some remarkable changes in
Dutch politics during the past few
years. The belief in ideologies has
weakened, the noticeable cleavages have
become less sharp between the religious
and the secular camps as well as
between Catholics and Protestants. Dif-
ferent from the neighboring West Ger-
many, no Christian Democratic Party
comprising Catholics and Protestants
has so far emerged in Holland, but it
is significant that in the European
Parliament at Strasbourg deputies from
the Dutch Catholic and Protestant
Parties sit on the benches of the Euro-
pean Federation of Christian Demo-
crats. The voices of all the major Dutch
Parties agree that the European Com-
mon Market should be enlarged to
include Britain.
The Dutch people have never liked
the French hegemony, and it seems,
that the results of a poll held in 1963
are still valid today. When asked to
give an opinion, should the Dutch have
to make a choice between France and
Britain as members of the Common
Market, only ten percent preferred the
present set-up without Britain, whilst
over 50 percent were in favor of voting
Britain in and France,out.
JUST BEING THEMSELVES
By GEOFFREY LEHMANN
Australian Poetry 1968. Edited by
Dorothy Auchterlonie. Angus &
Robertson. $2.25.
THIS IS A comprehensive and admir-
ably unbiased collection of the year’s
poetry. With commendable modesty
Dorothy Auchterlonie has excluded
herself from the anthology. Obviously
where a major poet edits a major
anthology this is not a policy which can
be followed. Editors should, I feel, treat
their own work with caution.
Dorothy Auchterlonie is the widow
of H. M. Green, whose “Modern Aus-
tralian Poetry,” published about 20
years ago, was the first really impor-
tant anthology to set the tone of
modern Australian poetry. I remember
reading through it as a schoolboy with
the same excitement that I read Michael
Roberts’ “Faber Book of Modern
Verse.” H. M. Green’s anthology still
reads very well and for my money has
a lot less deadwood than some of the
anthologies which have followed.
The anthology begins with “The
Princes’ Land,” by Les A. Murray. Mrs.
Green was so taken with the poem that
she has placed it as a prologue and
printed it in italics. The poem begins
with an image of maidens dancing
on the level green and two silver knights
in a wood. Then the mood changes:
But now a deadly stillness comes
Upon the brook, upon the green,
Upon the seven dancing maids,
The dented knights are dulled to
stone.
Images of destruction, war, and loss
of faith invade the work, but at the
end of the poem the poet returns to his
opening image of the dancing maidens,


but this time subtly altered, as there
are nine maidens, possibly to symbolise
the Muses, and Tom Bread and Cheese
of the beginning of the poem becomes
“The Prince of Cheese sleeps by his
plough” at the end. It is an allegory
of loss of faith and the regaining of
faith. It is also an allegory of how the
unearned paradise of childhood may
become the torment of adolescence,
which may in turn through faith “beyond
all twists of grief and fear” become the
earned paradise of maturity. The poem
may be taken personally or interpreted
as a 20th-century parable.
Another remarkable poem in this
anthology is A. D. Hope’s “On An
Engraving By Casserius.” There is an
age difference of 30 years between the
two poets, but the theme which lies at
the centre of Hope’s poem has many
Hope...a gentle tilt
similarities with Murray’s poem. In
1947, at the age of 40, Hope wrote in a
poem that “My dangerous days come
on.” He has obviously weathered those
dangerous days, when the talent of
many fine poets runs dry, and 20 years
later has reached “the princes’ land,” a
period of remarkable fertility, where Tie
is able to praise or censure in a gen-
erous and open style.
In this poem Hope praises an
anatomical engrhving by Casserius of a
drowned unknown woman with a foetus
dissected “in the abundance of her
grace.” His thoughts are with the
“surgeon adventurers” whose maps of
the body interest him far more than
the maps of De Quiros or Newton.
Hope is, of course, having a gentle
tilt at other Australian poets who have
written about the great explorers. In
this poem he confirms that his chief
theme is the exploration of the human
body, the person. Australian poetry as
a whole is much more concerned with
exploring the environment.
Inevitably a poem which is as com-
manding as this one makes one wish
to compare it with some of the major
poems of the century. It makes one
think of the marvellous late poems of
praise by Wallace Stevens. Compared,
however, with Stevens’ impeccable
feeling for language in “Credences of
Summer” or “The Old Philosopher in
Rome,” Hope has a slight tendency to
cliche and overwrite.
“Bell Rock,” by Douglas Stewart, is
another fine poem, but it shares some
of the slight weaknesses of language
with Hope’s. The image of a rock on
which a lighthouse is built under impos-
sible conditions and of a face disap-
pearing underwater remain with one a
long time after finishing the poem.
David Campbell’s “The Australian
Dream” is utterly delightful with its
description of the Queen calling on
Jock in his suburban home, and state
robes tucked away in the lowboy and
gold crowns on the bedside table. “Life-
Cycle,” by Bruce Dawe, on the other
hand did not appeal to me very much.
Bruce Dawe at his best is very good
indeed, but this satire on Melbourne’s
Australian Rules does not work for me.
Geoffrey Dutton’s “Island Girl” is
not Dutton at his best, and I wonder
whether some of his strong poems about
Russia published a bit more than a
year ago might not have been available
instead. James McAuley’s two poems
are very interesting and his style seems
to be undergoing a radical transfor-
mation. There are some other good
offerings in the book, among them
poems by Rosemary Dobson, Chris
Wallace-Crabbe, Vivian Smith, and
Roland Robinson.
Among the newer poets I was dis-
appointed that there was nothing by
Robert Boulton or Andrew Taylor, but
then I do not know what material was
available to Dorothy Auchterlonie.
B. A. Breen’s “The Searchers” is a
striking and controlled work.
Are there any trends discernible in
this anthology? Dorothy Auchterlonie
displays a slight bias toward verse
which is regular in form, although there
is a certain amount of free verse in the
book. I personally cannot see any new
wave. There are new poets emerging
and some of these are good and others
not so good. It is easy to put too much
emphasis on experimentation and not
enough on merely being oneself.
The experiments of Eliot, Pound, and
cummings so shattered the established
canons of English verse that any
experimentation now must be internal
rather than external. Experimentation
for its own sake has become a bit of
a bore. In retrospect the experimenta-
tion of Emily Dickinson, who turned
the language inside out while writing
in very prim, maidenly measures, is
much more striking than the more
obvious experiments of Pound and
Eliot. (This is not to deny their great-
ness!)
Australian poetry is now very much
the foster-child of the universities.
Without the academics it would be in
a very bad way indeed. But the present
atmosphere is conducive in weaker
poets to devitalised and flabby language,
and a tendency to what David Martin
in a poem entitled “Fallen Poets”
refers to as “permanent neurosis.” Other
situations breed other evils, however.
At the turn of the century, when
Australian poetry had a much larger
popular audience, the weaker poets
succumbed to Romantic diarrhoea or
else to villainous philistinism best
exemplified by C. J. Dennis. Every
environment has its innate defects. It
is easy to underestimate earlier Aus-
tralian culture and to imagine that the
bush balladists were a lot of ignorant
bushwhackers. Some of them may have
been, but the whole of the Red Page
was, for instance, devoted to Mallarme
the week he died.
All in all, there is not a significantly
larger number of good poets or poems
than there was then, which is why I
suspect new waves. Literary fame is a
fickle jade. In about 1906 a readers’
poll decided that Roderic Quinn, of all
people, was Australia’s best living poet.
MAN-DESTROYERS
By JOHN BAXTER
The Puzzleheaded Girl. Christina Stead.
Seeker and Warburg. $4.75.
IN THE INEXACT terminology of
modern literature, this book is categor-
ised as a collection of four novellas,
but any logical system would certainly
include it with the novels. In style and
theme it explores the same ground as
Miss Stead’s earlier works, while the
stories bear on a single subject and
even a single character. Names may
change, but the women in all four are
clearly aspects of the feminine mind,
each presented in an appropriate
setting. As in a cubist portrait, the
writer has split the head to show both
profiles plus the back and front.
Portrait or novel; whatever you call it,
“The Puzzleheaded Girl” is a remark-
able picture of a modern phenomenon,
the independent woman.
An English reviewer has quite fairly
described this book’s style as “rendered-
down Katherine Mansfield,” and cer-
tainly it lacks the bite of “Cotters’
England,” with its earthy colloquial
approach and moody evocation of
England’s black soul. But Miss Stead
has tailored her approach in this book
to the subject. In her eyes, the indepen-
dent woman is neither really indepen-
dent nor completely a woman. In three
of the four stories a heroine wanders
vaguely through life, pushed from rela-
tionship to relationship, finding neither
rest nor fulfilment until she meets and
is dominated by her fate. For some it
is a man, for others death, but the
result is always the same: the burial
alive of marriage or the oblivion of the
grave.
Of all the stories, I liked best “Girl
From the Beach,” the last of the
novellas and also the longest. By intro-
ducing two primary characters, foreign
correspondent George Paul and the
vague girl Linda, with whom he strikes
up a curious and destructive relation-

ship, the writer makes a double bid for
our attention and sympathy. Paul is a
palimpsest of journalistic cliches, with
his almost paranoic fear that his 1 ex-
wife will steal his rare reference
materials and the terror he experiences
when Linda goes away, taking with her
the keys to his car. Tough he may be,
but it is clear that he will never survive
Linda. Detached, brainless, uncom-
mitted, she can reduce the life of any
man to chaos by her mere refusal to
become involved.
Honor Lawrence, the “Puzzleheaded
Girl” of the title story, is another man-
destroying female, trading on the
instincts of men and women alike with-
out ever understanding them. Men,
attracted by her waiflike mien, make
vague overtures of assistance, only to
find them taken up literally, or
extended by her imagination into far
more complex offers. A vague invitation
for her to visit a client encourages her
to arrive on his doorstep prepared to
stay a month, a casual word becomes a
promise of lifelong friendship. Honor
represents the essential innocence of
women, the dominating self-interest
against which men have no weapon.
In the end it doesn’t matter to any
of the women in this book whether
their men live or die, and finally one
comes to understand that this to women
is a perfectly natural fact of life.
Lydia, of “The Dianas,” is more
honest about this antipathy than other
women, perhaps because she is not so
much malicious as lazy, willing to stand
up for her individuality when it is
directly threatened but content, by
drifting around in Paris, to avoid any
real contest of wills. “Men are a terrible
aphrodisiac,” she says languidly, “and
yet I don’t want them. They’re so much
trouble.” Her friend Tamara, trying
unsuccessfully to survive her lover’s
divorce and her own failing health,
provides a bitter feminine symbol of
emotion’s destructive and mindless
power, against which Lydia stands out
as a pure if motiveless spirit. When
Lydia does finally get married, it is
not for love nor for position but rather
in an act of chance, like someone buy-
ing a knick-knack in a shop. Her rich
husband locks her away in his mansion,
and she drifts as she drifted in Paris,
still an individual because her husband’s
demands are not emotional ones. She is
still Lydia, still a woman, never a wife.
It’s a tribute to Christina Stead that,
despite her sex, she can express this
essentially unappealing truth about
women. The honesty of her approach
comes over clearly in the end of “The
Puzzleheaded Girl,” where husband and
wife discuss the lost Honor Lawrence.
“She’s the ragged, wayward heart of
woman that doesn’t want to be caught
and hasn’t been caught,” the wife says.
But her husband is less sure. “Debrett
thought of this. He did not believe it,
but walking up and down under the
trees in someone’s garden he bent his
head a little, saw nothing, wiped his
eyes with his hands.” We men may not
have the writer’s sympathy, but at least
we have her understanding.

THE BURSTING BUDS
PROMISE
A MILLION BOTTLES
I MAY HAVE been the first to point
out, much to the delight of my South
Australian friends, that the Hunter
Valley produces less than one percent
of our total wine output. Actually, the
figure is rather misleading, for included
in the total wine output is all the wine
that is made into distillation material
as well as all the fortified wine.
Assuming total table wine production
to be somewhere around 10 million
gallons, the Hunter produces something
like four percent of the total of our
table wines. This is still only a spit in
the bucket. But not the wine judges’
bucket.
For that four percent includes some
of the best wines produced in Australia.
Many of the prizes for young wines are
won by Hunters, red and white. Most
of the burgundy top awards go to
Hunter wines, red and especially white.
The Hunter manages to take some of
the hock awards, though these days the
rhine rieslings from South Australia
and the Riverina and the traminers
from Rooty Hill win most of the top
medals in these classes. The claret prizes
are not for the Hunter, though occasion-
ally a firm red of a particular year will
be entered into both burgundy and
claret classes and do well in both. No
comment.
So the quality must be accepted,
whatever the degree of chauvinism of
the South Australians.
The tragedy is that so little of it is
available. As more and more Aus-
tralians drink table wine, and more and
more of them understand something
about quality, there is less and less of
it available for those of us who were
damn lucky in the old days. Not long
ago I could drive to the Hunter and
buy a couple of hundred dozen wine
for something like five shillings a bottle.
Today the wine costs more, often quite
a lot more, though there are still some
bargains if you keep your wine wits
about you. They don’t last long. Linde-
man’s and Penfold’s have supplies of
top-quality whites on the market most
of the time. Reds are issued occasionally
and are snapped up. McWilliams have
their famous Mount Pleasant reds and
whites strictly on quota. The smaller
makers, Tyrrell, Elliott, Tulloch, and
the two Drayton companies, have sup-
plies for only part of the year. In some
cases the reds last only two weeks! I
rang one maker for some information
for this article and he implored me not
to mention his wines. “I haven’t enough
to go around and you’ll only get me
into trouble.”
Well, I should like to be in that kind
of trouble. To be able to make an
article, sell it quickly for a good figure,
and go fishing for the rest of the year.
Come to think of it . . .
So what is being done to relieve the
situation? The wine business is a slow
business. There has been much planting
by the major companies, particularly
by Penfold’s and McWilliams, to pro-
vide table wine for the expanding
quality market. But even their efforts
are insufficient. The vines they planted
in ’63 and ’64 are producing grapes
for today’s wines, and, as I’ve pointed
out, these are still in short supply.
The ’65, ’66, and ’67 plantings will, I
forecast, scarcely be able to cater for
the increased demand that will be
evident by the ’seventies. Fortunately,
’6B has been an active year. It is still
far too early to say that it is a suc-
cessful planting year. Many of the ’66
plantings failed, even though the root-
lings shot in that year. The extended
drought of r 67, which wasn’t broken
until the January of the following
year, killed hundreds of the young
vines. Much of this is being replanted
this year.
Thus far the season has been favor-
able. There was some excess rain during
the planting season, but this drained
fairly quickly and conditions are near
ideal. The sap is high in the tender
little sticks just poking out of the
ground, some buds are appearing, and
there is much bating of breath—’6B
could be a significant year in the history
of the Hunter.
Penfold’s now have over 400 acres
planted at their Dalwood Estate at
Wybong. The red varieties' planted on
the black alluvial soil have not been
as successful as was hoped, and now
they are concentrating on the red vol-
canic slopes at the back of the property.
Sixty-six acres of hermitage went in
this year, plus ten more of cabernet
sauvignon, and five of pinot noir. In
addition, some 25 acres of semilion
were planted. I applaud this, for I find
the wines of this variety from Wybong
to be of the highest quality.
So 106 acres is not a bad start for a
planting report. The report continues
in the same happy vein. McWilliams
are trying to get their 100-acre
vineyard, along the Broke Road from
Rosehill and Lakes Folly, fully estab-
lished this year, and 50 acres should be
finished by now. This is all in hermi-
tage and cabernet. Their white planting
is restricted to the Lovedale Vineyard
on the Branxton Road, traminer and
rhine riesling being the varieties they
are concentrating on. Lindeman’s
recently purchased the Stephens’ land,
which is surrounded on three sides by
the Hungerford block. This is top soil
and much is expected of it. The 90
acres will be entirely devoted to hermi-
tage, and they hope to get at least half
of it done this year. They have also
almost completed their semilion plant-
ing at their Sunshine Vineyard, both
replacing some older vines and extend-
ing other sections. Some reconstitution
work was also done at Ben Ean.
Of the smaller, established wine-
makers, Tyrrell planted five acres of
CONNOISSEUR
TABLE WINES
NOTES FROM LINDEMAN'S
CELLAR MANAGER
By a process of natural selection during
the past century, the two main grape
varieties of the Hunter River Valley
today are Red Hermitage and Hunter
River Riesling. From these are pro-
duced the majority of the quality table
wines of the Hunter River Valley, and
generally they are reasonably pro-
ductive.
Two other white grape varieties in the
area are Traminer and Verdelhao, and
whilst both are very poor croppers, the
wines they produce are extremely dis-
tinctive and of very high quality.
Traminer is one of the major varieties
grown in Alsace, and it is also popular
in the Rhineland. It is frequently called
Gewurztraminer, because of the ex-
tremely pungent, aromatic, fruity, and
spicy bouquet and flavour of the wine
the word “gewurz” meaning “spicy.”
Verdelhao hails from the Canary Is.,
where it is the grape variety used to
produce one of the four traditional
styles of Madeira. We have found that
it produces an excellent Dry White,
again very pungent and aromatic,
although quite different fro,m Traminer.
At “Ben Ean” we have a substantial
acreage of Traminer grapes interplanted
with Riesling, and in recent years have
been bottling the wine as a special
varietal wine. This week we have re-
leased the 1967 vintage wine under our
newly designed “Hunter River” label
—a label which will be used exclusively
for all our Hunter wines in due course.
At our Sunshine Vineyard we have a
substantial acreage of Verdelhao grapes,
again interplanted with Riesling grapes,
and for some months have been market-
ing the 1966 vintage Verdelhao/
Riesling. Stocks of this wine are almost
exhausted and we will shortly be re-
leasing the 1967 wine.

hermitage and nearly one acre of pinot
noir. The latter is a good example of
the slow business. From the mother
vine at Griffith, Murray obtained a
handful of cuttings. These were planted
and struck. From the young vines came
other cuttings. These were planted and
struck. From the young vines came cut-
tings. And so on and so on. Many years’
work to establish a flourishing vineyard.
Drayton’s Bellevue (Len, Reg, Max,
Dick, Bill) completed planting on their
Lambkin Estate Vineyard a total
ten acres of the blanquette, rhine
riesling, and semilion varieties. The
Lambkin Estate Vineyard now totals
40 acres. It lies next block to Lake’s
Folly, starting alongside his hermitage
paddock that I helped plant in 1964
with the dreaded Oxenbould, a noted
dibbler, singer, and Rugby Union
selector.
Barry Drayton’s Happy Valley has
an appropriate smiling face, though
they are late with their planting pro-
gram this year. Barry doesn’t seem to
mind, for his uncle used to plant into
November with success. He has started
on his blanquette and semilion, and
hopes to get in two and ten acres
respectively of each. Another ten acres
of hermitage will see him out this year.
Barry now has 80 acres of bearing and
30 of non-bearing vines.
Doug Elliott, laconic and pleasant as
ever, very pleased about the improve-
ment in the lightening of his red style,
has planted seven acres of hermitage,
five at Fordwich and two at Belford,
where the great whites come from. I
couldn’t find out what Tulloch’s have
done, though Keith didn’t think it was
much this year.
What of the new boys? Ah, there’s a
question. At Hungerford Hill Vineyards
alone 180 acres. Norm Hanckel, late of
Yalumba, full of horrifying energy, has
done a great job together with Simon
Currant. One hundred and twenty
acres of hermitage, 35 of semilion, and
25 of cabernet sauvignon. A mighty
effort indeed. I wish them great success.
**>>>»* Estate, of which I ant
a small P art > was also the scene of
much activity; 90 acres of vineyard
being planted by the first week of
September. Of this, 51 acres are
semillon and just under 40 hermitage.
We are concentrating initially on
proven varieties, and plan to have some-
thing over 200 acres of these under
vine within three years. Other varieties
will make up the balance of some 40
or 50 acres.
Frank Margan, my old Wine Bureau
mate, and his syndicate, very much do-
it-yourself at the weekends, have
planted 16 acres altogether, three of
hermitage, one of pinot chardonnay,
and 12 of semilion. The vineyard looks
a picture and buds are bursting out all
over. In addition to all this, there are
at least three other new, private vine-
yard areas I have heard of, and there
could well be others.
What does all this dry-as-dust infor-
mation mean to all but the enthusiast?
It means something to slake the thirst.
In one year, 1968, nearly 400 acres
of precious Hunter Valley land has
been planted with two great red wine
varieties, hermitage (black shiraz) and
cabernet sauvignon, plus some few of
pinot noir. In addition, something over
160 acres of white varieties have been
planted, the major proportion of it
semilion, with some blanquette, char-
donnay, rhine riesling, and traminer to
provide interest and variety.
The reds should be in full bearing
by 1975, the whites by 1973. Eventually,
the ’6B planting, if successful, should
produce up to 750 tons of red material
and over 600 tons of white grapes.
Which means well over 100,000
gallons of red wine and over 80,000
gallons of white.
Which means appoximately 1,200,000
bottles of wine, EACH YEAR, coming
from the plantings that have just been
completed in the Hunter Valley this
year.
And I still don’t think it’s enough.

THE ARTS
AND ENTERTAINMENT
Graduation time for a
“good year” at NIDA
By REX CRAMPHORNE
EACH SEPTEMBER another ten or
12 young actors and actresses graduate
from the National Institute of Dramatic
Art in Sydney the only effective
training institution in Australia. The
occasion is marked by a graduation
production which gives agents, directors,
and public a chance to look over the
new talent. On the basis of this first
appearance most of the graduates will'
find their first employment in the
theatre some will continue to find
it there. The atmosphere, then, tends to
be fairly tense among the actors. Not
without reason, they feel that their two-
year investment and hoped-for career
are being weighed in the balance. Some-
how a play has been found that will
fit the group fairly well, giving them
all a reasonable chance to display their
talent. Inevitably, some must work on
one or two roles which seem small and
unrewarding, and some must cope with
a part well outside their age or
character range. But the tutor in charge
of the production generally manages to
serve both the actors and their audi-
ence fairly; we see those most likely to
succeed at their best, for the production
is also a demonstration of the Institute’s
capabilities.
From personal experience I will
hazard a quick generalisation about
NIDA: the main problem is in the
selection of each year’s intake. The
nature of the training (emotionally and
psychologically it is rather like an
assault course for recruits) demands a
group of people who will fit together
in collective strength, and not separate
out as a series of embattled individuals.
A “good year” are strong enough
together to experiment and to react
positively .to the tutors, getting the best
out of the training available. A “bad
year” are so weighed down with
problems and personal senses of in-
justice that they accept the nature of
the training reluctantly, never really
feeling that they are getting much out
of it. In this sense the current group
have been very “good.” Their corporate
personality of enthusiasm and involve-
ment has made possible a particularly
valuable series of improvisation classes
with Jim Sharman which have encour-
aged the group’s ensemble development
both as students and actors. The feeling
is strong enough to make them want
to continue weekly improvisations
together after graduation.
This year this results on stage, in
Robin Lovejoy’s production of “The
Beaux’ Stratagem,” in sufficient col-
lective and individual self-confidence to
try for characterisations and effects
often impossibly outside personal range.
Not one of the performances could be
described as safe or easy for the actor
giving it. Take, for example, Nick
Lathouris, as Boniface, the rotund, 58-
year-old landlord of the inn. Acknow-
ledging the unlikeliness of the casting,
the actor avoids tiresome and utimately
pointless photographic realism (under
any other circumstances the part would
be given to an actor who fitted it),
trying for an athletic, physical per-
formance, somewhere between ballet
and commedia delVarte in inspiration.
The ingenuity of the attempt commands
respect even when it goes beyond the
actor’s present capabilities.
Sandra Grose does exactly the same
thing with Lady Bountiful—the “civil,
old country gentlewoman’’ is blown up
to grotesque proportions with such
aplomb that the sheer buoyancy of the
attempt almost carries us away. Among
those parts nearer their range Terence
Bader (Scrub) and John Ivkovitch
(Bellair) make a good deal of impact
in short appearances by virtue of
relaxed and assured playing for laughs.
The two heroes of “broken fortunes”
are particularly well cast and played—
David Cameron with a jeun premier
air of charm and sincerity as Aimwell,
against Joe Hasham, the blunt and
aggressive Archer.
However, the honors of the evening
must probably go to Gillian Jones as
Mrs. Sullen, and her scenes with Penny
Hackforth-Jones (a remarkably good
Dorinda) are the backbone of the pro-
duction. Mrs. Sullen is a woman who
“can love to all the tenderness of
wishes, sighs, and tears —but go no
farther,” and her passion for Archer
and her loathing for her “country
blockhead” husband are constantly at
war with her determination to preserve
her honor. And yet she owns herself to
be “a woman, full of my sex; a gentle,
generous soul, easy and yielding to soft
desires; a spacious heart, where love
and all his train might lodge.” Gillian
Jones manages to convey the wealth of
feminine nuance in the character with
the greatest success, giving one of the
most pleasing performances I’ve seen
this year.
The remarkable thing about it all is
that despite the occasion (one on which
a desire to exhibit personal talent on a
competitive basis would be not un-
natural) the production achieves a good
workmanlike treatment of a difficult
Gillian Jones ...“one of the most
pleasing performances this year”
play, keeping up pace and interest in
fairly tedious stretches of exposition and
pushing on strongly through an ex-
tended and involved denouement.
Finally, the impression is of a kind of
total vitality from the group collec-
tively, under the momentum of which
they will continue to improve after
graduation.
THEATRE/PHILLIP ADAMS
CHEKHOV UNDERSTOOD
Three Sisters. Anton Chekhov. Russell
Street Theatre, Melbourne.
The Living Room. Graham Greene. St.
Martin’s Theatre, Melbourne.
White With Wire Wheels. Jack Hib-
berd. Union Theatre, Melbourne.
CHEKHOV liked his little jokes. Once
he thrust a carefully wrapped water-
melon into the jiands of a startled
Moscow policeman, insisting that it was
an anarchist’s time-bomb. Almost path-
ologically afraid of loneliness, he kept
open house for hundreds, and in a
typical invitation to a friend said, “Come
and stay or I’ll call up evil spirits and
make your pants fall down in public.”
And characteristically getting the last
laugh, his corpse was returned from the
Black Forest to Russia in a refrigerated
railway van marked “fresh oysters.”
Yet this was the man of whom Gorky
complained “he walks the earth like
a doctor in a hospital; there are many
patients but no medicines; besides, the
doctor is not sure that medicines are
any use.” Tolstoy, too, deplored Chek-
hov’s alleged pessimism, and many
modem critics see little but gloom in
his philosophy. In his program notes
for the National Theatre’s production of
“Three Sisters,” Sir Laurence Olivier
attempts to reconcile Chekhov’s contra-
dictions as follows: “We remember how
he insists that all his tragedies are
comedies. One may detect a slight note
of self-deprecation in this, but one
must take the hint boldly enough to
ensure that what is serious must filter


through a tender awareness of human
frailties and absurdities.”
And that seems the key to under-
standing and enjoying this extraordinary
writer. In a sense he was the 19th cen-
tury’s Harold Pinter. For, like Pinter,
his plays involve masses of everyday
trivia and verbal repetitions. The char-
acters of both writers often speak aim-
lessly, without expecting to be listened
to or understood. Both writers believe
in economy of expression, and write
with reserve and restraint: in their plots
tension builds but little eventuates. In
“Three Sisters,” as in many a Pinter
play, the tragedy is what fails to happen
rather than what occurs. Chekhov is
very modern in his use of silences, and
his characters are often lost in thought.
In fact, there are no fewer than 66
pauses specified in “Three Sisters’ ” text.
The essential difference is the size of the
writers’ talent. Where Pinter can
manage two or three characters over
a time span of a few days, Chekhov
juggles dozens over a decade. And for
all his existential irony, Chekhov’s
humor and compassion make his
dialogue throb and ache with life.
George Ogilvie’s production of this
formidable play is splendid, and the
performances are almost uniformly
excellent. I’ve only two criticisms to
make one involving Kristian Fred-
rikson’s stage designs and the other
relating to the play’s final moments.
Determined to emphasise the bleakness
of the Prozorovs’ provincial life, Fred-
rikson painted his settings in shades of
grey, and most of the costumes are grey
as well. This strikes me as being ham-
fisted and unnecessary.
And I felt that Ogilvie was quite
wrong to conclude the play with his
starry-eyed tableau of the three sisters.
After facing their respective disasters,
Chekhov has them speak bravely of a
better future. But where Ogilvie allows
this future to be described with vehem-
ence and certainty, I’m sure the author
intended the words to be, at best, a
doubtful prayer.
Graham Greene’s “The Living
Room” is timely in the sense that it
Maggie Millar (l.), Jennifer Claire, and
Lyndell Rowe in the MTC’s production
of Chekhov’s “Three Sisters”
allows liberal and orthodox Catholic
attitudes a fight to the finish. The plot
involves a domestic bun-fight, which
builds steadily toward a crescendo
involving different characters in
hysteria, suicide, and emotional col-
lapse. And while George Fairfax’s pro-
duction looked appropriately sombre,
his cast was too restrained to make the
melodrama credible. On the evidence
provided by the actress Sandy Gore,
the character Rose Pemberton wasn’t
sufficiently distraught for suicide. Moira
Carleton was far too controlled and
matter-of-fact to be a convincing
hysteric, and the anguish of Brian
Moll’s crippled priest wasn’t commen-
surate with the play’s demands. As the
tormented hero, Carl Bleazby was
tranquillised. Only Leila Blake, in a
minor role, captured the oppressive,
choking emotionalism that the plot
required.
“White With Wire Wheels” is a
comedy of bad manners, in which young
Australians of the beer-can-and-chunder
variety are seen to denigrate their
women while worshipping their cars.
In a previous production I found this
play enormously impressive—viciously
accurate and as funny as good graffiti.
But the Contact Theatre took it far too
seriously and hammered home the
work’s significance from the first
moments of an over-impactive produc-
tion. The play should be treated lightly,
in an off-hand, flippant way so as to
allow the characters’ nastiness to sneak
up on the audience. To express it in
the correct motoring terminology, the
cast thrashed the play through the gears
instead of running it in.
MUSIC/KAY LUCAS
WHEN CREATIVITY HURTS
ON SEPTEMBER 4, in the Melbourne
Town Hall, the audience was treated
to a demonstration of the lengths to
which an idea, combining the maximum
of philosophic pretension with the mini-
mum of musical potential, can actually
be taken before it collapses under its
own weight. The occasion was the first
performance of a symphonic work,
“The Laocoon,” by Melbourne critic
and composer Felix Werder.
According to Mr. Werder’s own por-
tentous program notes, the significance
of the title is more philosophic than
programmatic. The philosophic struc-
ture centres on the aesthetic theories
of Lessing and C. P. E. Bach, but is
densely populated with lesser figures,
including Moses, Mendelssohn, Goethe,
Winckelmann, Laocoon himself, Pythag-
oras, Apollo, and Ferdinand Leitner.
The musical score is also densely popu-
lated—with notes, which is a testimony
to the composer’s industry, if not auto-
matically to his inventiveness, for apart
from the philosophic structure there
was little to distinguish this piece from
all the others written in a similarly
turgid, cacophonous vein. The com-
poser is at pains to deny any pro-
grammatic connection between the
music and the famous statue, but one
was tempted to read in his description
of the figures of the statue as “showing
all the possible contortions of pain on
their features,” a description of the
expressions of the members of the
orchestra as they strove to lift the
music “from the region of miserable
observation into the free fields of
thought” (pace Goethe), where, accord-
ing to Mr. Werder, it was conceived.
If utter humorlessness can be taken
as being synonymous with integrity,
then Mr. Werder’s music is less to be
reproached than is his musical criticism,
though one notices with interest how
the same qualities of imaginative
sterility and expressive aridity charac-
terise both his music and his prose, his
creative and his critical thinking. The
work forces one to ask certain funda-
mental questions about the function
of music in the concert hall today. Mr.
Werder is obviously very conscious of
the serious moral responsibility of the
creative artist, and sees his duty as
being more to instruct than to enter-
tain: in his notes he talks solemnly of
social commitment and of the artist’s
obligation to take “a stand on the
wickedness of the world.” Such an idea
is in the best traditions of 19th-century
thinking. One wonders, however, at
what stage in the deterioration of our
culture this idea developed into the
notion that it is actually a crime for
anyone simply to enjoy what the artist
has created with so much pain and
effort.
One can only assume, after this per-
formance, that Mr. Werder cherishes
the belief that as the artist suffers in
the creation of the work, so everyone
else must suffer in its realisation,
orchestra and audience alike. A reason-
able attitude, one supposes, and at any
rate one which adds strongly biblical
overtones of Mosaic vengeance to the
19th-century ideals. One wonders,
though, whether it is likely to find a
ready following in these days of
multiple diversions of a rather less
punitive nature.
It is a truism of historical thinking
that great genius does not spring from
infertile soil, and that the vitality of
the musical culture is ensured by the
activities of all creative artists whatever
their calibre. Mr. Werder deserves at
least to be saluted for doing his bit in
thus helping prepare the soil for the
emergence of a genuine creative talent.
However, it is also an acknowledged
fact that the work of such preparatory
figures does not benefit from over-
exposure. It is, therefore, with no inten-
tion of disrespect to Mr. Werder and
with no desire to sabotage his modest
aim for his work (of discovering “a
principle that would remain true within
the framework of art for all time”)
that one expresses the hope that, after
its obligatory repeat performance, “The
Laocoon” will be laid to rest in the
archives of the Melbourne Orchestra,
quietly and with dignity, its task
accomplished.


From Greece, an optimistic
examination of the world
“The Episode No. 3,” an oil on canvas by Jannis Spyropoulos
By EDDIE 'BATACHE
Detail of “Tegea No. 5.” 1962, by
Spyropoulos
JANNIS SPYROPOULOS, whose exhi-
bition opens on September 25 at the
David Jones’ Art Gallery, Sydney, is
one of the most attractive artists of our
time. Greek by birth and by choice —he
still lives in Athens —Spyropoulos is,
nevertheless, an international artist
whose paintings seem as much at home
in Sydney as they do in Athens, Paris,
or New York.
Before meeting Spyropoulos in
Athens last year I had been extremely
impressed by his first exhibition in
Sydney in 1965. Later, I was lucky
enough to see some of his work in
New York, in Brussels, Nuremberg, and
in Paris at the Musee d’Art Moderne,
where his Logos F was among the
recent acquisitions, surrounded by four
Picassos. In Athens, his canvases are
everywhere: from the Greek Royal
Palace to the Ministry of Education
and from the National Bank of Greece
to the Athens Town Hall, not to men-
tion, of course, the National Gallery.
Spyropoulos is not only the greatest
artist in Greece today but one of the
few authentic top-names in contem-
porary art. I was quite conscious of this
when I dared to knock at his door in
Athens, but I had no idea what sort of
man I was going to meet. But as soon
as his wife took me into their beautiful
home I knew that no disappointment
Jannis Spyropoulos...“the greatest
artist in Greece today”


was in store for me. The setting in
which he lived arid worked appeared
to me to be perfect. No view of the
sea, no exotic garden: the beauty is all
inside. White walls, simple but elegant
furniture, comfortable but not luxurious.
Every room has been carefully built to
give the right light and setting to the
paintings.
Samples of very different styles—
from early figurative periods to
the most recent abstract achievements—
offer to the visitor a unique and com-
plete survey of the artist’s evolution.
It seems as if the whole house and its
contents were created to serve the
paintings assembled within these walls.
The visit to the studio and to the
whole house was a delight beyond
description. I had a fair idea of the
different aspects of Spyropoulos’ art,
but I never imagined I could find such
a high degree of quality in so many of
the paintings assembled there. Jannis
seemed more and more amused at my
reactions, but whenever I tried to get
his opinion on my own interpretations
he always replied mysteriously: “I
paint. You interpret.”
But he did not mind giving me the
highlights of his career. Born in Pylos
in 1912, he studied at the School of
Fine Arts in Athens between 1933 and
1938 and received his diploma there.
In 1938, after winning a scholarship
from the Academy of Athens, he went
to Paris, where he stayed until 1940.
He spent the war years in Athens.
His first one-man show was held in
1950 in Athens. In 1958 he was one
of the Greek candidates for the Inter-
national Guggenheim Prize in New
York.
In 1960, Spyropoulos was one of the
Greek representatives at the Venice
Biennale and was awarded the
UNESCO prize. He was, in fact, the
first Greek artist to receive a prize at
the Venice Biennale since its institution
in the 19th century. Since this official
recognition, Spyropoulos has acquired
an international fame, well illustrated
by his numerous one-man shows. His
works hang today from Belgrade
(Musee de l’Art Contemporain) to
Auckland (City of Auckland Art Gal-
lery) and they are appreciated as much
in South America as in the Middle East.
Before I met Spyropoulos I was
somehow convinced that his art was
essentially intellectual. I was wrong. It
appeals less to our mind than to our
heart and intuition. I had the feeling
that his aim was to prove some theory,
that his paintings were serving an
ideology. In fact, it is less the result
of a speculative mind than the reflec-
tions, in the world of art, of a deeply
human quality.
Spyropoulos does not examine the
world from any particular point of view
—with penetration or suspicion —he
feels the world with an open-hearted
optimism. His generosity is one of the
soul, and in a gloomy world like ours
he has expressed it with colorful
“slices” of hope glittering in the dark-
ness.
FILMS/BEVERLEY TIVEY
POOR BUT DISHONEST
Poor Cow. Director, Kenneth Loach.
Prudence and The Pill. Director, Fielder
Cook.
KENNETH LOACH made his name as
a director of television documentaries,
and his first feature film is full of the
techniques and tricks of that medium
—excessive use of the hand-held
camera, accumulation of irrelevant
detail to lend atmosphere and reality.
“Poor Cow” even ends with Joy, its
central character, staring straight into
the camera and answering questions
about her views on life and the future
as in a “People” interview.
But what comes off on the tiny screen
isn’t always so successful in a drama for
theatrical presentation; and I confess I
found the scrappy technique tiresome
and distracting. Dramatic treatment, in
my view, is based on selectivity
maybe that like life, but if the
selection is intelligent and understand-
ing it heightens our awareness of life.
Otherwise what is the novelist, the
playwright, or scriptwriter for? One
might as well set up a camera and
tape-recorder in any house and expect
the result with all its interruptions
of preparing meals, signing for a regis-
tered letter, or belching to add up
to a well-knit drama.
Some individual scenes are very
effective—the opening sequence of the
birth of Joy’s baby is particularly well
done—but the lasting impression of even
the best is apt to be dissipated by the
camera’s wandering off to show us
irrelevant people whom Kenneth Loach
evidently saw as “interesting faces” and
therefore could not resist. The amount
of footage wasted on totally meaning-
less (even if pictorially pleasing) shots
is staggering.
There is little form or construction
in this story of Joy’s progression from
one misery to another. Indeed, most of
her life is so unjoyful that at times the
movie is rather like “East Lynne” with
a cockney accent. But Loach’s deter-
mination not to overdramatise manages
to deaden the ' impact, nonetheless
genuine for its lack of subtlety, of the
ripe Victorian melodrama which, in its
inverted way, this script harks back to.
It might be subtitled “She was poor,
but she was dishonest.”
Married by the necessity of her
pregnancy to a burglar, Joy is left
alone when he is jailed, but soon takes
up with his mate, with whom she en-
joys a brief, idyllic happiness until this
“warm and tender” man (to quote
her description) is sent up for robbery
with brutal violence to an old woman.
Joy becomes a barmaid, then a semi-
nude photographer’s model, consoling
herself frequently with the embraces of
casual pick-ups. “I don’t want to be a
pro,” she says, but doesn’t object to
accepting “a couple of quid” from her
lovers a fine line of distinction that
somehow escapes me.
The film comes to no conclusion,,
either moral or dramatic. It just stops,
with a vague suggestion that Joy’s,
general irresponsibility is somehow
redeemed by her love of her child.
Carol White gives a very capable sur-
face performance, but never reaches the
heart and soul of the character. In
fact, this cool detachment is the film’s
main fault: Carol White and Terence
Stamp as stars and Loach as director
are too busy being recognisably realistic
to reach the emotions of the spectator.
The other players in general only get
the chance to give character cameos:
all the same, Kate Williams, as Joy’s
friend Beryl, manages to bring a glow
of genuine human warmth that the
movie can very well do with.
Nobody could object anyway, I
don’t object—to a good, rousing dirty
joke about the Pill. But I detest the
sniggering, elbow-in-the-ribs attitude of
“Prudence and The Pill,” an out-of-date
comedy which has tried to look modern
by talking about that subject. This-
movie, with its complete incomprehen-
sion of what’s really happening today
(or any other day) and its assumption
that pregnancy is per se a joke, seems
to me far more obscene than any of the
graffiti of “Motel.”
How on earth did Deborah Kerr and
David Niven, an elegant and dignified
pair of players, get themselves mixed
up with this? You can’t tell me that
either of them is as hard up for a job
as that.

“It is not surprising that Joan Littlewood’s production has
been packing in audiences. It is an easy bet that it will
continue to pack them in. As a theatrical experience, it
moves one in many ways, to feelings strangely mixed. It
moves to rage that humanity should have been
capable of making a fool of itself on such a scale, and to
horror lest it should prove capable of doing so again on
an even greater scale. And yet, mingled with this there
comes a strange exhilaration and a nostalgia. For those
who fought in that war and were lucky enough to survive
it, this show conjures up memories that are not all
painful.”
—W. A. Darlington, London.
“An intensely bitter, frequently mocking, and always mov-
ing panorama of the 1914-18 war played out in a kaleido-
scope of music and lantern slides and short speeches that
stab at the heart like knives. Employing the devices of
revue, this entertainment traces the progress of that most
terrible war in all its futility, its blindness, ns monstrous
stupidity. Yet it remains one of the most stirring and
remarkable evenings presented on the British stage for
many years. I have a feeling this show will be with us
for a considerable time to come.”
—Herbert Kretzmcr, London.
“A brilliant anti-war assault. Stunning stage craftsmanship
makes ‘War’ a stirring emotional experience. Presenting
the earlier World War in the ironic terms of a Pierrot
show, production mixes the popular songs of the period.
The elfect is overwhelming in its sheer, cumulative power.
‘War’ is enormously shrewd in mingling humour and song
with its anger and scorn.”
—Post, New York.
“Slaughter to music. Much of it is funny, much of it
carefree. Yet behind the action we see the facts.”
—Maureen Cleave, London.
“With a genial smile, a cheerful song, a lively step and a
lot of incredible lines drawn from history, ‘War* puts war
into sardonic perspective. The songs, dances and sayings
of 50 years ago have the requisite distance to lend
enchantment to the first World War. Laughing, slashing
show with a wonderfully disarming air of geniality.”

TALKING SENSE
AUSTRALIAN radio has become a
little too voluble for its own good in
the past two years with its proliferating
“talk” programs, but one welcome
by-product of its infatuation with
opinion is the fact that it is taking news
more seriously. This was demonstrated
during Russia’s invasion of Czecho-
slovakia, when it used voice reports
from the BBC, the Voice of America,
the American Broadcasting Company,
the Armed Forces Radio, and, occasion-
ally, their own correspondents.
The Macquarie network, which uses
T. S. Monks, “The Sydney Morning
Herald’s” diplomatic correspondent, as
its London man, added his pieces on
the Czech crisis to material from the
BBC’s radio newsreel which reaches
Macquarie twice a day. For the major
network, 2UE’s Tom Jacobs has been
travelling through Europe for the past
few months on one of those dream-time
excursions, “the roving assignment.” He
was in Germany when the Russians
invaded Czechoslovakia and has since
been sent to Moscow to file reports
from there.
But 2SM, fresh from its Glenfield
coup (Wally Mellish chose to announce
his surrender through 2SM), scored a
second time with a telephone interview
with Shirley Temple, who just hap-
pened to be trapped in Prague in the
midst of the crisis. The station owed
this piece of one-upmanship to its
association with Metromedia, an Ameri-
can radio network which uses a lot of
telephone interviews.
“America has better telephone con-
tacts to Europe than we have,” 2SM’s
news director Garvin Rutherford said,
“so it is easier for us to ring the States
through Compac. We discovered this
during the Arab-Israeli war.”
CATCHING UP WITH MUSIC
ALTHOUGH most significant com-
posers have written works which have
disconcerted their audiences, there has
never been such a breakdown in com-
munication as exists today. The decision
of Schoenberg, Webern, and company
to renounce the vernacular as a form
of musical expression has led to the
extraordinary situation where com-
posers are more articulate than they
have ever been, yet their art has become
increasingly esoteric.
An attempt to bridge the gulf
between the composer and his audience
is being made in a series of five lecture-
demonstrations entitled “Australian
Music —-A Revolution in the Making,”
which began on September 10 in the
Small Hall of the N.S.W. Conserva-
torium of Music and will continue on
consecutive Tuesdays to October 8,
beginning at 6.30 p.m. and finishing at
8 p.m. ?
The protagonists' are Richard Meale,
Peter Sculthorpe, Nigel Butterley, and
Professor Donald Peart, all eminently
civilised and all thoroughly articulate.
Provided these gentlemen do their
homework as well as Richard Meale
did in the first lecture, this project could
be tremendously rewarding. Even those
who do not necessarily wish to get into
step with what is going on in music
should, nevertheless, welcome the
opportunity to stagger alongside.
POETRY FROM PESTLES
A NEW poetry magazine has appeared
in Melbourne under the somewhat odd
name of “The Great Auk.” Edited by
a young poet, Charles Buckmaster, the
magazine has received the rather
unlikely sponsorship of a group of staff
members at the Victorian College of
Pharmacy, where Buckmaster works as
a laboratory assistant. It is the third
new poetry magazine to be launched in
Melbourne this year, and all have so
far reported healthy sales. And now
there are weekly poetry readings at
La Mama Writers’ Workshop and
Experimental Theatre in Carlton. It is
only coincidental that the cultural
appeal of Melbourne’s football season
is drawing to a close for another year.
FAREWELL TO HURRAH
THE Sydney production of “America
Hurrah” has ended after a 14-week
season at the New Theatre, five of them
with the trilogy in its unexpurgated
state. Not surprisingly, attendances
began to fall away after the N.S.W.
Chief Secretary, Mr. Willis, censored
the offending “Motel”; no amount of
often hysterical outrage against the ban
could compensate a public which quite
obviously wanted to see the play com-
plete with all its four-letter words.
The controversy was noisy to the end,
with a telecast of an impassioned public
discussion in the New Theatre in which
impresario Harry M. Miller dis-
tinguished himself by doing a Kenneth
Tynan and having the word obliterated
to a harmless phfft to avoid offending
the Broadcasting Control Board.
At the end, the New Theatre was
uncompromising, refusing to submit an
amended text to Mr. Willis; the Chief
Secretary was inflexible, refusing to lift
his ban on “Motel” unless the text was
amended. Victory both for principles
and the law. On which note the New
prepares for its next show —the first
production in Sydney of the Piscator-
Neumann adaptation of Tolstoy’s monu-
mental novel “War and Peace.” Even
Mr. Willis should appreciate the irony
of the choice.

Letters
"Famine-1975!"
In countering the extreme pessimism
of the authors of “Famine—l97s!” Mr.
Peter Samuel (8., August 10)
approaches complacency. Current in-
creases in food production in many
developing countries are remarkable
achievements and they should be made
widely known. They are the first real
results of years of patient and often
frustrating work by farmers, scientists,
administrators, extension workers, and
politicians. However, the adequacy of
current and anticipated production can
only be measured against population
numbers. At only one point in his long
article did Mr. Samuel refer to popula-
tion.
In its three-volume report on the
“World Food Problem,” the U.S. Presi-
dent’s Science Advisory Committee used
two sets of calculations based on “high”
and “low” population projections. The
“low” projection assumes steady pro-
gress in family planning. In the short
term, the “high” projection seems more
relevant. The “high” series of esti-
mates predicts a 52 percent increase in
world population to 5.03 billion in
1985. In many developing countries
this means a doubling of population in
the short space of 20 to 27 years. The
world will need at least 50 percent
more food in 1985. The report points
out that in calculating requirements an
unknown underestimate is introduced
because adjustment is needed for con-
siderable losses from harvest to table.
There is also the paradox that improve-
ment in nutrition can be expected to
increase the average body weight of
adults by 10 percent or more during
20 years, with a corresponding increase
in food requirements.
The authors of “Famine - 1975!”
point out that to the present every
prediction of population increase has
been an underestimate when census
times finally arrived. Another warning
is that because deathrates have fallen
remarkably in most developing coun-
tries there is a tendency to believe
that they have stabilised. In most
countries they still have a long way to
go before they reach those of Taiwan,
Ceylon, and Singapore, but they are
likely to with the continuing programs
of public health and improved medical
services.
Peter Samuel’s reference to India’s
100-million-ton food grain harvest needs
to be set against the Indian Planning
Commission’s crop figure of 95 million
tons. This may seem a quibble, but the
difference of 5 million tons is more
than half Australia’s total wheat produc-
tion. The 95 million tons is an increase
of 20 million tons over the previous
year of disastrous drought, but it is
not a large increase, in relation to need,
over the previous record of 89 million
tons in 1964-65. India will still import
more than 6 million tons despite the
fine harvest, and has only two years
in which to reach the 120 million tons
needed in 1970-71. At best, the pro-
gress Peter Samuel has noted in several
countries can only ensure that people
are maintained at present levels of
inadequate nutrition.
There has never been any doubt
that people could be better fed. Despite
encouraging trends at present, the
question of whether food supply and
population will be brought into balance
is still to be answered.

Cricket v. Apartheid
In “Cricket v. Apartheid” (8.,
September 7), you say that the MCC
selectors “made a sad political blunder”
and that “their decision to leave out
Basil d’Oliveira from the side to tour
South Africa makes no sense at all
in cricketing terms . . .”
Just consider the conditions of such
a tour where it is essential for the
team to keep together. Quite possible
in chartered buses or in reserved rail
carriages; not always possible by air
without the expense of chartered flights;
almost impossible in regard to hotel
accommodation. D’Oliveira would, on
many occasions, be odd man out. Under
such conditions he could hardly be
expected to give of his best as a
cricketer.
Although apartheid does not operate
in the West Indies it is inevitable that
people of such diverse races as West
Indian and European often exclude
each other. As a Cape Colored,
d’Oliveira must have sometimes felt
himself to be odd man out. This may
explain his failure on the West Indies
tour.
I suggest that the above reasons were
behind the MCC’s decision to exclude
d’Oliveira on cricketing grounds, and
that it would have been “a sad political
blunder” if it had made these reasons
public.

Not churlish

anthology “New Impulses in Australian
Poetry” (8., August 24) says that
“Jones wouldn’t let two of his earlier

in good faith the assertion of the
editors, but since this imputes to me
inexplicably churlish behaviour I should
like to clarify the matter.
Thomas Shapcott initially wrote to
me asking permission to use the two
poems in question. I replied that I
would prefer a different choice as one
poem seemed to me not too good and
the other had been overworked as my
one anthology piece, and suggested that
they might consider later poems; to
which Shapcott replied that they knew
of no later poems. I sent him five (not

lies in methodically set-

amount each payday—
after meeting normal ex-
penses—and investing it
securely at a satisfactory
rate of interest. Whatever
the amount, you will be
amazed how it accumu-
lates, especially with the

knowing that other poets were to be
represented by as many as a dozen
poems), all of them, as well as others,
having appeared in predictable places;
of those, Hall and Shapcott chose three,
professing themselves much better
pleased with these than with their
original representation. Subsequently, I
received notice that for reasons of space
only one of these poems could be
included.
As editors, they are perfectly entitled
to the opinion that one poem adequately
represents my position in the current
poetic “scene”; they have no right to
lay off their bet by imputing to me
their failure to use any more of my
poems.

Morgenthau on Kennedy
For what reason did you find it neces-
sary/to reprint (8., August 31) Hans
Morgenthau’s article on Robert Ken-
nedy? On what basis can Morgenthau
substantiate his charges of mutual
hatred between Kennedy and Lyndon
Johnson, of Kennedy’s “dedication to
personal success” (he sought the Vice-
Presidential nomination, in spite of his
alleged hatred of Johnson, for this
reason, says Morgenthau), of “his cold
shrewdness and passion” (somewhat
contradictory tendencies, surely), and
the other gratuitous nonsense with
which Morgenthau pads his article?
Morgenthau infers his charges from
events on which a totally different con-
struction can be placed and from
unsupported rumors. In any event, he
contradicts himself: Kennedy is clouded
in his thinking by “no emotion,” inter
alia. But “passion, too, plays its part.”

North of the Tweed
Your article “What do we know about
Asia?” (8., July 20) confirms my im-
pression that, for The Bulletin, as for
many other “national” organs of com-
munication, Australia does not extend
north of the Tweed River. I refer in
particular to the section of the article
which discussed Asian language studies
in schools. Here in Queensland, six
schools (five State high schools and
one private school) are at present
teaching Japanese. This compares
favorably with the numbers of schools
in the States you quoted, “four State
schools in New South Wales and “one
or two Victorian schools,” yet there
was no mention of Queensland’s efforts
at this level. School instruction in
Japanese began here in 1967, and the
first batch of students taking the
language are currently in their second
year of high school.

Comalco?
Yes.
At the new Victorian Arts Centre
you’ll see Comalco aluminium
just about everywhere you look.
Rarely has architectural aluminium been used
so effectively as throughout the new Victorian Arts
Centre, which houses one of the world’s great art
collections. You’ll see the muted bronze-coloured
tones of Kalcolor* aluminium from Comalco in
countless examples ... from the elegant frames of
the water screen at the entrance to the soaring
eaves which encircle this very special building.
Even the flagpoles! Just as you’ll see Comalco
aluminium when you look at most of Australia’s
important buildings of recent years.
