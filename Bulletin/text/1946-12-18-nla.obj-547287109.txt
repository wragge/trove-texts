LONDON AS QUEEN VICTORIA KNEW THE HEART OF EMPIRE.
Old Merchant Taylors’ School.
npHIS series of views, which is published by arrangement with-
the House of Seppelt, now shows the Merchant Taylors’ School
as it was during the reign of Queen Victoria. Founded in
Suffolk Lane in 1561, the first Merchant Taylors’ School was
destroyed by the Great Fire. A second School rose on the same
site, and in 1875 it removed to Charterhouse Square, on the site
of the flld Charterhouse School, the cloisters of which may be
seen on the left of this picture. The School governors have
from the first been members of the Merchant Taylors’ Company.
Amongst men whom the School has educated are Thomas Lodge
and James Shirley, the dramatists, Balstrode Whitlocke, and Lord
Clive of India. It is of interest that the School owes much of its
prowess to Sir Thomas White, who founded St. John s College,
Oxford, and who reserved there 43 scholarships for the Merchant
Taylors’ boys. The School left Charterhouse in 1933.

SPORTING STORIES.
There are several dozens of these, of
the kinds indicated by the titles, in Best
Sporting Stories, chosen by J. Wentworth
Day, and Sporting Detective Stories,
edited by Ellery Queen (Faber publica-
tions from Angus and Robertson), and of
another kind in Walter Hammond’s
Cricket My Destiny (Stanley Paul), which
is possibly as good a title as any worse
one.
The captain of England adds.agreeably
enough to the run-of-mill books by
cricketers on cricket. It is an account of
Mr. Hammond’s cricketing life; descrip-
tive of tours; appreciative of dozens of
other players, and so forth. It does not
explain the secret of just why its author
would have to be included in any match
between elevens of the greatest cricketers
of all time. The batting scores, fielding,
bowling merely say that he would have
to be picked ; as with pretty well all books
of the kind, there is no explanation of the
particular I genius for cricket.
Also, as with nearly all books of the
kind, the point is missed that what is
really interesting about a great cricketer
is himself on the field playing cricket.
That calls for a descriptive and analytical
pen—like Ray Robinson’s —wielded by
someone looking on as a spectator with
an appreciation of the human and
histrionic element involved in what he is
witnessing; Hammond the whole man
there on the field in the role of Hammond
the cricketing genius. Cricket autobio-
graphers are shy folk actually ; they may
be as vain as peacocks, but they are not
much given to self-exhibitionism with the
pen. The captain of England hasn’t even
that sort of vanity to spice his account.
He is so naturally shy with the pen that he
seems to be really writing against the
grain. There’s a demand for his book,
and, well, hang it all, he’ll meet it; but
he’d much rather be playing cricket. The
result is a book with plenty in it to in-
terest those who like reading of cricket
performances; those who ask of auto-
biography that it should have dramatic
human depths will have to try elsewhere.
Mr. Hammond, of course, has plenty
of information to give on all the matches
he has played in, and a paragraph or two
will show its kind, something of the, at
least, melodramatic human side, and
something, too, of Test “cricket,” that
grotesque spawn of a pleasant country
game;
The next day’s play began with three
l.b.w. decisions in succession, and the Aus-
tralians were all out for 122. Jack Gregory
did not bat. We knew he had suffered a
recurrence of his old knee trouble, a loose
cartilage, while bowling in our first innings,
but nobody on our side realised that we
had seen the last of one of the greatest
and most generous cricketers of modern
times, the more since his attack in our
first innings was magnificent and tireless.
When he reached the pavilion there were
tears on his face, and Bradman records
the scene and Gregory’s gasp, “Boys—l’m
through. I’m finished!” It was a tragic
match for Australia, for Charlie Kelleway
got ptomaine poisoning during the game,
and he, tod, was never able to play big
cricket again.
These things took the heart out of our
opponents, and it seemed as if the weather
maliciously decided to kick them when they
were down. Rain was obviously threaten-
ing, and we knew that once it fell the
wicket would be a batsman’s hell. We had
a lead of 399 runs on the first innings,
but if we put the Australians in to follow
on, and anything went wrong, we might
find ourselves in trouble later. Chapman
decided that we must get some more runs.
He was bitterly attacked for this by most
of the Australian newspaper critics; but I
think any wise skipper would have done
the same. It was the first Test, and to
ensure a win in the opening game of the
rubber is worth all the patience in the
world. Not even the consideration that
two fine batsmen were unable to play on
the opposite side could have compensated
for the taking of any unavoidable risk.
A sporting move is all very well in a
friendly game, but in modern Test cricket
nditions are too stern for that.
Mr. Hammond, of course, has his say
on bodyline ; he’s agin it. Still, he points
out that when Woodfull one day stopped
a Larwood V-ball over the heart the Aus-
tralian captain was well outside his off
stump. Also, that when Oldfield—“the
best wicketkeeper of modern times” —
stopped one of them it was with the
right side of his head.
Any competent cricket sleuth, let alone
the infallible ones in the Ellery Queen
book, would be able to deduce from those
Statements that Woodfull and Oldfield
stopped what they did mainly through
bad management. Even so, Mr. Ham-
mond admits that had bodyline continued
he’d have got out of the game.
The Ellery Queen sleuths range over
all manner of sports, the term being
stretched to include poker, chess and
even butterfly chasing. There’s not much
to be said about the book ; f.a.q. detective
short stories, with a totally non-detective
crime story thrown in just to bring in
swimming, and not swimming as a sport,
either. Ellery Queen—our detective
bureau informs us that this isn’t a person,
but rather a syndicate or a conspiracy to
churn out detective fiction —certainly
doesn’t suffer from any measure of
modesty: there are three Ellery Queen
stories in the book, all bad. H. C.
Bailey is represented by two stories ; all
the others by one, some of them good.
The Ellery Queen stories are most in-
teresting as American specimens to be
contrasted with the English specimens.
Where this sort of American writing
stems from the present reader knowcth
not. It is smart stuff; very tricky; its
popularity seeming to emphasise that a
lot of people enjoy having their legs
pulled. It is artificial, utterly improbable,
and hence literary rubbish. Its occur-
rence, wherever it may stem from, is not
made to seem any the more admirable by
the presence in the book of another sort
of American writing in the genre: an
excellent piece of writing, authentic
literature, stemming straight from Edgar
Allan Poe; a story called “The Purple
Emperor,” by Robert W. Chambers.
The English specimens nearly all stem
fairly directly from Conan Doyle, who
isn’t represented in the detective volume,
but who contributes one of the finest
stories in Mr. Day’s collection; one of
the best things ever done on a prize-fight,
and fully up to Hazlitt’s grand essay. The
odd thing about, these straight sporting
stories —not the detective ones—is that in
very few of them is there any true plot
to speak of or which actually matters.
Their value is ih the remarkable repre-
sentations of the various games, the fight*
the fishing and so forth as something
being personally witnessed and experi-
enced. The result is an excellent little
book on strictly literary grounds, apart
altogether from the sporting interest. It
should be popular ; pretty well everybody
except Bernard Shaw is interested in some
sport or other, and most sports are dealt
with in it in really good accounts. There’s
even one by the writer who spoke of
flannelled fools and muddied oafs: Rud-
yard liked polo.
Two Sentimental Blokes.
In A. H. Chisholm’s The Making of a
Sentimental Bloke there is reference to
an American anthologist’s surprise that
a U.S.A. edition of the poem had failed
in 1916. It is possible that Americans
remembered a book of similar character
published in the U.S. in 1901— Love Son-
nets of a Hoodlum, by Wallace Irwin.
I tracked down Love Sonnets in the
Alexander Turnbull Library, M.L., and
have a typed copy. After reading it one
realises that the slang of Songs of a Sen-
timental Bloke is a mixture of Australian
and the slang of the San Francisco under-
world.
Though Dennis’s book is much better
written, the stories are similar. The girl
in Love Sonnets of a Hoodlum is named
Mamie, and the Sentimental Guy named
Willie loses her to Brick Murphy, a red-
haired drug-clerk.
Irwin’s opening runs:
Let me down easy, reader, say!
Don’t run the bluff that you are “on,”
Or proudly scoff at every toff
Who rattles off a rag-time con.
Get next to how the French Villon,
Before Jack Hangman yanked him high,
Quilled slangy stuff and Frenchy guff
And kicked up rough the same as I.
In 22 sonnets, prologue and epilogue,
the story runs neck and neck with
Dennis’s tale of love, but ends on a note
of woe, Willie having lost his Mamie.
Here are some extracts which might be
compared with similar passages in The
Bloke : —
Say, will she treat me white pr throw me down,
Give me the glassy glare or welcome hand,
Shove me the dirt or treat me on the grand,
Knife me or make me think I own the town?
I do not know, nor do I give a whoop,
But this I know: if she is so inclined
She can come play with me on our back stoop.
On the dead level I am sore of heart,
For nifty Mame has frosted me complete.
I know my rival and it makes me sore—
Tis Murphy, night clerk in McCunn’s drug-
store.
Last night—oh, yesternights!—! flagged my
queen,
Steering for Gurnsky’s icecream joint, full sail.
I up and braced her, breezy as a gale.
Just then Brick Murphy butted in between,
Rushing my funny song-and-dance to jail,
My syncopated con-talk no avail
For Murphy was the only nectarine.
For when I pushed Brick Murphy* to the* rope,
Mame manned the ambulance and dragged him
in,
Massaged his lamps with fragrant drug-store
dope
And coughed up loops of kindergarten chin;
one sprang a come-back, piped for the patrol,
then threw a glance that tommyhawked my
soul.
Last night I tumbled off the watercart —
It was a peacherino of a drunk;
\ the cocktail market on the punk
And tore up all the sidewalks from the start.
Life is a combination hard to buck,
A proposition difficult to beat,
Een when you get there Zaza with both feet,
cu flickers it’s the same hard luck,
ohanghaied without a steady place to eat,
Guyed by the very copper on your beat
r\j ri s to you w hen you run amuck.
O Life! You give yours truly quite a pain
On the T-square, I do not like your style;
ror you are playing favorites again
And you have got me handicapped a mile.
This article is not written to belittle
the work of C. J. Dennis. In the intro-
duction to Love Sonnets of a Hoodlum
Gelert Burgess said, in effect, there was
nothing new under the sun, and suggested
a comparison between John Webster’s
forcible picture in The White Devil:
“Fate is a spaniel; we cannot beat it
from us!” and Irwin’s “O Fate thou art
a lobster,!”
Will Lawson.
Particles of Criticism.
Turning over A. G. Stephens’s criticism
in the mind one does not recall any great
single essay: only the excellence of his
opinions, the vigor and consistency with
which he expressed them, his importance
at the centre of the literary movement
of his day. In his way and in his time,
the need for a guide and champion being
greater, he may have done more for
Australian literature than Hazlitt and
Matthew Arnold did for English.
But you do not find in Stephens, as
you do in the great English critics —
down to T. S. Eliot today—mastery of
style, mastery of the essay form. And
from Stephens to the present-day Aus-
tralian criticism (reaching its lowest level
in the dailies, where important books,
half-read, one feels, are dismissed in six
or eight inches of worthless praise or
attack) suffers from a general scrappi-
ness.
There are exceptions. T. Inglis Moore’s
Six Australian Poets was full-scale criti-
cism. Among the literary magazines
the “Australian Quarterly” has always
found space for the essay as distinct from
the “review” or “article”; “Southerly”
publishes an essay from time to time
and, presumably, is likely to offer more
space now that it has been expanded by
Angus and Robertson ; “Meanjin Papers,”
too, has been expanded (by Melbourne
University Press).
R. G. Howarth’s Literary Particles
(Angus and Robertson) is not an ex-
ception to the rule of scrappiness. Taking
it .as it stands, a collection of short articles
and reviews chiefly reprinted from
“Southerly” and “S.M. Herald,” it is
interesting and pleasant enough. Mr.
Howarth finds a reference to The Bulletin
in Finnegans Wake —“Eastralia’s poor-
users of the Sydney Parade Ballotin’’; he
reviews the career of a notable English
scoundrel, “born, we may be gratified
to discover, in Woolloomooloo,” who
exhibited a monumental angel as the
mummy of a winged man; he quotes
some excruciating verse encountered in a
literary competition ; he discusses Brown-
ing’s “Mr. Sludge,” Joseph Furphy, the
humanity of the 17th-century lyrists,
William Ireland (the forger of Shak-
speare), Osbert Sitwell on poltergeists;
and he quotes from James WTiitall’s Eng-
lish Years a pleasing anecdote about
George Moore Moore, autographing
books at Heinemann’s, noticed somebody
else in the room and was annoyed:
All talk about books is good talk ; and
this is all about books. But, except that
he is refreshingly exasperated with Ger-
trude Stein and that he values Furphy
chiefly for his humor, it is difficult to
detect any strong critical opinions in Mr.
Howarth’s “particles” ; the references to
Australian writing are few ; and though
one enjoys reading the book as a whole
it leaves one with the impression that
one hasn’t read anything in particular.
Mr. Howarth has not included an ex-
cellent essay on Ezra Pound he published
in Some Modern Writers. He has edited
for Everyman’s Library Minor Poets of
the Seventeenth Century, Letters and the
Second Diary of Samuel Pepys and
Letters of Lord Byron; and in
“Southerly” and elsewhere he has written
authoritatively on Hugh McCrae, Bren-
nan and the novels of Norman Lindsay:
yet in Literary Particles he is silent on
most of these subjects and has very
little to say on the others. Instead of
surrendering to the tradition of scrappi-
ness in Australian criticism Mr. Howarth
is obviously capable of breaking it.
“I am very busy signing these pages
for my book. Would you mind going
away? I cannot be disturbed.” No imme-
diate notice being taken of his unusual
request, he persisted, thinking to settle
the matter forthwith: “I am George Moore.
Will you please go away?” Whereupon the
man across the room raised his handsome
head, smiled, and said: “My name is John
Galsworthy, and I am signing pages for
a book, too.” Then he left.
Youngsters Books.
Assuming that authors of children’s
books write with a special eye on their
audience, Leslie Rees must see his public
as a sturdy lot of young realists. In his
The Story of Karrawingi the Emu (John
Sands, Ltd.) he is notably more realistic
than the general run of nature writers
for adult readers.
Mr. Rees makes some narrative conces-
sions to the age of his prospective audi-
ence, but he is no patroniser of the child
mind. He meets it as an equal, making
the terms himself. He gives it a good
story woven about emu contacts with
blacks and whites and eaglehawks and
dingoes in an Australian scene as clear
and accurate as his emu lore. Being a
good story, it necessarily has sentiment,
but Mr, Rees disdains sentimentalism.
Altogether it’s hard to say what aged
audience Mr. Rees really had in mind.
The quality of his prose certainly belongs
well outside the nursery: chapter five,,
“Sad Fate of Some Eggs,” begins;
It was a crisp, still July night. The moon
shone out of a frozen sky and hundreds
of stars spangled the dark vault like splin-
tered crystal. So clear was the night light
over the breathless bush that trees and
shrubs stood out in precise outline as
though seen through inky glass. Their
shadows were monstrous sprawling shapes.
Hoar-frost thick on the grass gleamed
rigidly, whitely; rain puddles in logs froze;
the bush seemed paralysed with cold.
Then the narrative gets on with its easy
flow: “Out of the stilly silence, free so
far from any sound of animal or insect,
bird or man, came a faint booming.”
That is Karrawingi, Mr. Rees’s realisti-
cally projected emu, booming the news
of the eggs, and booming a claim for
himself in that current of consciously
Australian literature to which, irrespective
of its particular audience, Mr. Rees’s book
belongs. No doubt there’s considerable
value in the providing of realistic native
nature lore in fine prose for Australian
youngsters, but even so it’s hard to down
a feeling that a prose-writer of this quality
has bigger work inviting him.
Walter Cunningham’s exceptionally
fine color illustrations match Mr. Rees’s
realism, and the same excellent illustrator
gives his realistic touch to a companion
volume from the same publishers: Silver-
tail, the Story of a Lyrebird, by Ina
Watson. Miss Watson, however, is not
herself of Mr. Rees’s and the artist’s
realistic kind. She has in mind a defi-
nitely juvenile audience, and her book,
written from a romantic viewpoint, be-
longs to the more familiar school of
books for youngsters. Much the same
might be said of A. W. D’Ombrain’s
O Nita Rinkus (Australasian Medical
Publishing Co.), which takes a couple of
children down to a creek and introduces
them to its birds and beasts, the platypus
in particular. It is pleasantly .told and
prettily illustrated.
The Antics of Algy, by Musette Morell,
illustrated by Hartmut Lahm (Angus
and Robertson), is also definitely
of the nursery; smart and catchy
in humorous prose and verse on the
doings of Algy the Ant. Lahm’s illustra-
tions have a genius of quaintness in them.
Both Algy and Silvertail belong to (he
accepted general run of children’s books,
of no particular classification. Mr. Rees's
book, as stated, comes out of a distinct
Australian current, and the source is just
as distinct, though it isn’t Australian in
that sense, in The Wizard of Jenolan, by
Nuri Mass, illustrated by Celeste Mass
(Angus and Robertson). The setting is
Australian enough—the Jenolan Caves
in the Blue Mountains ; very contagiously
projected, too —but the source is the
highly imaginative one of Hans Andersen
and the Grimms. For the youngster
audience there is exciting adventure
through the other-world of the curious
caves; as seen by the author in an in-
troductory verse.
And over all, the hand of untold ages,
Magic and haunting as a bell-bird’s chime,
Hovering, spell-like, upon glance and footstep:
Mysterious witchery of change—and time!
The imaginative quality foreshadowed
in the verse haunts the story ; definitely a
children’s book, yet the kind of writing
that comes only from a fine mind.
There’s imagination again, though of a
homelier quality, in Ella McFadyen’s
Pegmen Tales (Angus and Robertson), in
which a family of clothes-pegs comes to
life. Rescued from a flood in the Mac-
quarie by the timely arrival of an ark,
Mr, and Mrs. Peg and family float down
the Barwon and the Darling and out onto
the broad seas; where, among other ad-
ventures, they catch a record shark and
bring it through Sydney Heads to be
weighed on the scales at Watson’s Bay—a
very creditable feat for a clothes-peg.
The book is good in its Australian
scenery, and also in its incidental rhymes;
Old Mrs. Soapsuds
Was crazy in her head,
She went to hang the washing out
And hung herself instead.

How to treat a house paintbrush after use?
If brushes are likely to be used at reasonable
periods they should be .suspended by their
handles with the bristles submerged in raw
linseed oil, keeping the tips of the bristles
clear of the bottom. If the brush is not likely
to be used for a long period it should be
thoroughly washed in soap and water, dried,
and wrapped in waterproof paper. Brushes
should be stored in a moderately warm place.

(1) What is pumice-stone, and where does it
come from ? (2) Are its cleansing properties
due to something in its composition?
(1) It is a light porous rock formed under
the influence of intense subterranean heat. The
pores or spaces in its sponge-like formation
were originally filled with gas. Pumice-stone
is thrown to the surface during volcanic erup-
tions. (2) No. The effect is solely due to. its
abrasive qualities. Removal of discolorations
is accomplished by rubbing away a thin layer
of skin.

Method of bleaching hessian ?
This is one of the hardest materials to bleach,
but the bleaching may be effected by treatment
with alkaline hypochlorite solution followed
by treatment with sodium bisulphite. To get
a good bleach it may be necessary to repeat
the hypochlorite treatment several times. Two
methods of preparing alk. hypoch. are (at

cold water. Mix the two solutions, stir well
for a half-hour, allow to settle overnight, then
draw off the clear solution. The residue should
be washed with water, allowed to settle and
the top liquor added to the main solution.
This may be done several times, but the mam
solution should remain at 6deg. to 7deg. tw.
Next add Hlb. to 21b. soda ash, dissolve and
stand overnight, pour off clear liquor and use
for bleaching after it has been diluted to the
strength required, (b) Mix 1201 b. caustic soda
and 700-8001 b. water, put 1001 b. of the mixture
into carboy packed with ice and salt, arid pass
chlorine into it. When 161 b. _ chlorine has
passed in and the solution is still alkaline to
phenolphthalein, shut off the chlorine. Keep
the temperature as low as possible. The result-
ing hypochlorite solution may be diluted as
desired.

What sails did H.M.S. Sirius, the guardship
of the First Fleet, carry?
Her rig was three square sails on the fore-
mast, three on the mainmast and one square
topsail on the mizzenmast. She did not carry
royals,, the long square pole at the head of
each mast being merely a flagpole, not strong
enough to carry a sail. She also earned one
jib, the usual staysails, and a mizzen or driver

Is it possible to tell the time from the
position of the Southern Cross?
This can only be done with , accuracy by
means of a theodolite and nautical almanac,
and requires a knowledge of astronomy as well
as of the use of the instrument. Time can be
roughly ascertained from the position of the
pointers of the Southern Cross, which com-
pletes one revolution in roughly 24 hours, or
15 degrees each hour, but the position of the
Cross and pointers at any given hour varies
throughout the year.

Gladioli should be dug up not later than six
weeks after the flowers fade. Dry the bulbs
thoroughly, then store them in a dry place
ready for next season. Sow the seed taken
from the flower-stalk 6in. apart in a mixture
of three parts sand and one of soil. Don’t
disturb the seedlings for two years, except for
cutting off any small flowers which may show;
the third year dig them up and reset in loamy
soil. Retain bulbs only of the best flowers
raised by this method.

What is the meaning attached to George
Lambert’s picture “Important People”?
Here is Lambert’s own interpretation: “The
baby is the centre of the composition, as
motherhood is the dominant factor in human
life. Health and strength, physical development
and sport are, symbolised by the pugilist, and
commerce by the gentleman with the cigarette.
The wheel of the cart, the composition motive
of which is repeated by the sickle in the right-
hand comer of the picture, represents life and
death.”

(1) Who was the first Australian to win the
V. in World War I, and how did he earn
it ? (2) Where can I find a full account of his
deed ?
(1) Capt. Albert Jacka (then Private). On
the night of May 19, 1915, at Courtney’s Post,
Gallipoli, he and four other privates were
holding portion of a trench and were attacked.
Jacka’s four comrades were killed or wounded
and single-handed he disposed of seven Turks,
shooting five and bayoneting the others. (2)

LABOR MEMBER’S PRAYER.
Oh, Lord, when comes that bitter time
Which bars me from the portals here,
Direct me to some other clime
With handsome salary every year.
Or see my colleagues who survive
At least provide some sinecure
That will support me while alive,
My thoughts politically pure.
Direct and prosper, Lord, their ways
Who guard some people’s welfare well;
May full employment all their days
Find still their tankards full as well.
The roll is long of those who’ve made
Good stepping stones from Labor’s seats,
Whence the defeated, undismayed,
Collect sweet jobs, and all the sweets.
And so, Defeat, where lies thy sting ?
For some soft job I sure was meant,
My diligence reward must bring—
That’s why I entered Parliament!

UNCLE TED'S ELEVATION
By RODERICK
FINLAYSON
ONCLE Ted and Jake are cleaning
up around the cowshed, loading
the sledge with cow-muck and
running it out to spread on the
paddocks. Uncle Ted says that this will
soon remake the pastures. Indeed, there
are signs of improvement in all directions
on the farm.
They are working in thoughtful silence
when Crummer’s boy Johnny and a
stranger come upon them round the
corner of the cowshed guided there by
the sound of their scraping shovels. The
stranger is a ferrety little man in a blue-
stripe suit, a rumpled raincoat and a soft
hat.
“A man to see y’,” says
Johnny. • “I bring him up
from the store.” And he
stands by the cow-bails
with his hands stuck in-
side the band of his pants
to listen.
Uncle Ted, who is just
off with a full load on the
sledge, pulls up the white
horse with a “whoa now,
Charlie,” and looks ex-
pectantly at the stranger.
“Mr. Edward Green?” says the man.
“Well, that’s me, I guess,” says Uncle
Ted, although he’s taken aback by the
strange sound of his full name.
“Pleased to meet you, Mr. Green,”
says the little man, holding out his hand.
He winces just a bit when it’s given a
good squeeze by Uncle Ted’s big horny
cow-mucky paw. He fishes out a card
that Uncle Ted turns slowly over and
spells out in a bewildered way, “Mr,
Snape . . . ‘Pacific Times’ ...”
Jake looks over Uncle Ted’s shoulder.
“Mr. Snape’s a reporter, from the ‘Pacific
Times,’ the big newspaper,” he explains.
“That’s right, Mr. Green,” says the
reporter. “Now, I have some news for
you. Quite good news,” he adds with a
comforting smile, “Word has just come
to Gosper and Gosper, the Auckland
solicitors, that your uncle, Sir Thomas
Green of Little Harp, England, has died.
You inherit the title.”
With a little smirk of pleasure Mr.
Snape waits for the news to sink in.
Uncle Ted waits too, without changing
his look of quiet patience with this
strange bloke’s ways. Jake glances from
one to the other.
“That means that you are now Sir
Edward.” Mr. Snape explains, rather
disappointed, but still keeping up his
special smirk.
“Oh! ” says Uncle Ted.
“You’ve come into a title. You’re a
lord or a duke or something,” says Jake.
“Didn’t you know anything about this
old English Sir Thomas?”
“Well, I knew there was relatives in the
old country sort of well-off. Grandpop
had no dealings with any of them after
they sent him—after he come out here.”
“Well, well, it just shows, doesn’t it?”
Mr. Snape beams. “You’ll hear from the
lawyers soon. I wanted to be first on
behalf of my newspaper to congratulate
you. Sir Edward,” says Mr. Snape in a
suddenly formal way. But when he blinks
again at the cow-muck he gives it up.
“You see, it was this way,” he says. And
he tells them how he was just having one
or two in the Central yesterday when one
of his cobbers, a lawyer bloke, mentioned
that some old English lord had snuffed
out and that the title would come to an
Edward Green of Tidal Creek. “I saw
a good story for my paper,” says Mr.
Snape, “so here I am, first with the news
—that’s our motto.”
“Well, that’s very kind of you, I’m
sure. Just seems a bit funny to me,” says
Uncle Ted, still holding Charlie’s reins
and staring at the cow-muck.
“Yes, yes, truth’s stranger than fiction,
ha! ” says Mr. Snape brightly, moving
out of the way of the bees that buzz
around the muck.
Uncle Ted makes as though to gee-up
old Charlie.
<‘\1/HAT about a few words for our
VV readers, er — Sir Edward?” Mr.
Snape says desperately. “Just a few
words and a photograph, of course.”
He finds himself smirking foolishly at
Jake. “Now I take it that all this is a
great surprise for you, Mr. — er — Sir
Edward. How do you feel about it?”
“Well,” drawls Uncle Ted, “it don’t
make me feel any different.”
“Yes, yes, ha!” Mr, Snape looks
round. He’s getting sick of the smell of
cow-muck. “I suppose you’ll make some
changes in your manner of living?”
“Changes? If you mean give up my
cows and a walk round the paddocks
with old Charlie here —not on your life,
not for any old Sir,” says Uncle Ted.
“Whoa there! Whoa, you dirty blasted
scrubber! ”
“True New Zealand democrat, eh. Sir,
Edward?” says Mr. Snape.
“Well, I better be spreading this muck,
Charlie’s getting fidgety,” says Uncle Ted.
“Go down to the whare, mister, and
make yourself at home and well have a
bite of lunch in a jiffy.”
The newspaperman is all thanks and
excuses. He must be back at the office
right away. Says he’ll hire a car at the
settlement and connect with the afternoon
train.
“Gosh, you town folk are a restless
crew,” says Uncle Ted.
“But how about this little photograph,
Mr.—er—Sir Edward?” says Mr. Snape,
bringing out his little quick-shot camera.
“Er —can you leave your work for just a
moment? Of course you’ll want to —er
—change?”
“Gosh,” says Uncle Ted, “if you want
a snapshot go ahead and take it, man,
old Charlie and all. I’d like a picture
of the old scrubber.”
Mr. Snape, screwing away at the
mechanism, sidles over to Jake and
mutters, “Better get him to do himself
up a bit, hadn’t we?”
“What about your new blazer and
your hat, Uncle Ted?” Jake calls out.
“Or do you want to have a wash first?”-
“Go ahead, man, and take your
picture,” shouts Uncle Ted. “The bloom-
ing horse is getting restless. You better
hurry.”
“Oh, well,” says Mr. Snape, pointing
the camera and clicking the shutter.
“That’s that.”
“Now just a turn round the paddock
with Charlie,, and we’ll go down for a
bite to eat,” says Uncle Ted. “I could
put you up for the night, mister,” he
adds.
“No, no; I must run,” says Mr. Snape.
“I mean, thank you again, Mr. Green
—er —Sir Edward. You’ll get a copy of
the ‘Times.’ This is quite a scoop. Good
bye, good bye.”
“Mind you get the taranaki gate
properly up,” Uncle Ted shouts after the
reporter.
Johnny Crum -
mer takes his hands
out of his pants
and trots after Mr.
Snape, whistling.
“What do you
make of him,
Jake?” says Uncle
Ted when he’s
satisfied that the
taranaki is up. He
gets the white
horse going and
starts to shovel off the muck as the
sledge moves slowly over the paddock
with Jake walking beside it holding the
reins,
“It must be true,” says Jake, “when the
‘Pacific Times’ has got hold of it. You
really will be Sir Edward. Gosh!”
“H’m!” says Uncle Ted,
“Everyone in Tidal Creek will know as
soon as that Crummer kid and the re-
porter get to the store,” Jake says.
“Makes no difference to me, of course,”
says Uncle Ted. “But now you see what
I always did tell you, that my people
ain’t just exactly nobodies. It’ll learn
some people a thing or two.”
“Yes, it will,” Jake agrees.
“All the same, I don’t believe it,” says
Uncle Ted,
Anew thought strikes Jake. “Might
be a heap of money too. Thousands of
pounds go with these English titles, you
know.”
“Ah, I hadn’t thought of that,” says
Uncle Ted. “Just shows the kind of folk
my people are. Well, I can use a bit of
hoot,” says Uncle Ted, beginning to liven
up. “I’ll buy up all that swamp and
drain and grass it, make real nice pad-
docks.” And he goes into great plans,
growing more enthusiastic all the time.
The spanking horses he’ll keep! And the
flash turnouts! And the grand figure
he’ll cut on Show Day with everybody
asking his advice!
“Everybody asking for a loan, more
like,” says Jake, but all the same he is
glad to see Uncle Ted becoming so
carefree again.
SATURDAY morning Uncle Ted says
he’s going down to the store. He says
he’d better see if there’s any word from
the lawyers yet. Jake reckons he’s curious
to hear how far the news has travelled.
As they near the store; Uncle Ted and
Jake hear a great hum of talk and loud
laughs, but when they look in the door
about all you can hear is the buzzing of
one or two blowflies marooned in the
store window for the winter. Uncle Ted
slouches in,
“Morning, morning,” he says offhand
in his quiet slow way.
Mr. Cummins looks up, pretending he’s
very surprised. “Oh,” he says, “good
morning Mr. —or should I say Sir
Edward?”
One or two of the men present chime
in with, “Congratulations, Ted,” thrust-
ing broadly grinning faces at him and
trying to grab his hand. The women
titter or gape, or nod and smile as though
they were kindly encouraging a backward
little child.
Uncle Ted stares a moment at Mr.
Cummins. “Sir nothing,” he says. “I want
a side of bacon.”
“But we heard,” stutters the store-
keeper. “That is, the gentleman from the
lawyers, you know ... It is correct, isn’t
it?”
“What’s correct?” Uncle Ted demands.
“About the title,” says Mr. Cummins
breathlessly, leaning forward slightly,
fingertips braced against the counter.
“Oh,” says Uncle Ted, “that bloke
what came gassing about his newspaper
yesterday? Don’t believe it ”
“But it’s all going to be in the paper.
It must be true.”
“Never believed nothing I ever read
in a paper yet,” says Uncle Ted.
That makes the men speak up. “Oh,
it’s right enough. We got it from the
joker himself. You’rei a jolly lucky
beggar.”
“Yes, isn’t he lucky ? Isn’t it an honor
for little old Tidal Creek?” says the
women.
“Any mail come through?” Uncle Ted
asks the storekeeper.
“Not yet,” says Mr. Cummins. “Prob-
ably be a lot for you Monday or Tues-
day,” he says meaningly.
“H’m,” says Uncle Ted, picking up the
bacon and making to go.
Before he gets to the door old Luke
the fisherman buttonholes him. “No, you
don’t,” he drawls. “Better stand the boys
a drink, eh? They’ve waited hours for it.
You can’t get away casual like that, boy.”
“Of course,” says Uncle Ted drawing
himself up, “my people in the old
country are well-connected like, but
blowed if I’m any blooming Sir!”
“Good for you! ” the men shout. “The
good old Pig Island spirit!” And they
carry him off to the pub, where Uncle
Ted, unusually genial and generous, buys
drinks all round.
“May as well en-
joy the joke, eh,
boys?” he says. He
primes the boys well
with whatever they
fancy, and makes
pointed jokes about
ordering champagne.
He digs his neigh-
bors in the ribs in a
coyly playful way,
and there are all
sorts of sly little
quips and chuckles
about “the last time
I had a drop, boys.” It’s quite a lively
party.
But Jake notices that Uncle Ted drinks
.little himself. While the company is
roaring “For he’s a jolly good fellow,”
Uncle Ted slips out the side door with
Jake and makes for home.
“Seems like a change in the atmosphere
around here,” smiles Uncle Ted.
“Trust a bit of good luck to give a
joker a good name,” Jake says, feeling
pretty wise.
“Wonder just how much hoot does
go with it,” says Uncle Ted, scratching
his chin.
“Well, they say most of those noble
families are absolutely penniless,’.’ says
Jake, saddened by his unaccustomed
beers.
“H’m,” says Uncle Ted, expressionless.
'“TUESDAY Uncle Ted sends Jake down
' alone for the mail. He’s had enough
of congratulations and Sir Edwards.
Jake races home with two big pockets,
one boldly marked “Gosper & Gosper,
Solicitors,” and the other embossed with
the flowery blue design of the “Pacific
Times”. The envelopes are well thumb-
marked. Jake reckons that almost every-
one in Tidal Creek has had a squiz at
them. He can imagine the excited com-
ments: “So it’s right enough, eh?” “This
settles it.” “Fancy old Ted being Sir
Edward Somebody.” “Always said he
wasn’t £ bad old stick.” “Well,
this explains why he’s sort of differ-
ent.” “Yes, you can tell blue blood
when you see it, all right.”
Uncle Ted is carefully splitting posts
to fence off the big swamp he’s planning
to make such a success of. In spite of
Jake’s impatience he finishes driving home
a wedge into the macrocarpa log before
he drops his mall, takes the letters and
tears open first the one from the lawyers.
His blunt fingers fumble the folded type-
written sheet that shakes unsteadily be-
fore his blank gaze.
“Here, Jake, you read it. All this
lawyer’s palaver is no good to me,”
Jake reads aloud, “Sir, We regret to
inform y0u....a .regrettable blunder....
the action of an irresponsible reporter
.... sorry that you should suffer dis-
appointment the real inheritor being
Edward S. Greer of Tidal Creek South,
not Tidal Creek North... .Trust that you
will accept this. ...etc. etc. etc.”
“Wh—what’s it mean?” Uncle Ted
stammers.
“Oh, gosh. Uncle Ted, it’s all a mistake.
The man who’s getting the title is some-
body in the South Island.”
“Here, see this one,” says Uncle Ted
hollowly, giving Jake the “Pacific Times”
envelope.
“Dear Sir,” Jake reads, “Please accept
sincerest apologies. a regrettable slip
on the part of our legal advisers....
accidents will happen just in time to
stop publication in our journal... .hoping
.... etc. etc. etc.”
“Well, that’s that,” says Jake. “Hard
luck. Uncle Ted.”
Uncle Ted picks up his mall, goes to
strike the wedge—and leans on the mall
handle instead, sucking his teeth.
“So there won’t be no money,” he says.
“No money,” says Jake. “And no Sir
Edward either.”

THE “LITTLE PEOPLES” OF EUROPE.
In a world which is being remodelled
by decisions of international conferences
—the Big Four, the Council of Foreign
Ministers, the temporarily-disbanded 21
Nations, the United Nations Organisation
—the position of the “little peoples,”
the small nations of Europe, vital in its
elfect on the peace of the world, is much
debated, but little considered. R. H.
Markham, writing in the “Christian
Science Monitor,” states his belief that
“There can be no peace or security or
prosperity in the world unless an inter-
national situation is established that will
enable most of the small nations to be
free.”'
Markham lists Poland, Rumania, Hun-
gary, Austria, Bulgaria, Yugoslavia and
Greece as small countries whose future
is doubtful. C. L. Sulzberger, in the
N.Y. “Times,” adds Venezia Giulia and
Trieste, remarking further that “it is a
curious factor in the history of humanity’s
methods of settling humanity’s own
problems that in the end only a hand-
ful of men must make decisions regard-
ing the future of millions of little people
whom they do not know. It is extremely
dubious whether Secretary of State James
F. Byrnes, Foreign Secretary Ernest
Bevin, President Georges Bidault or
Foreign Minister Vyacheslav M. Molotov
have ever visited any of those areas whose,
future, with the wisdom of Solomon, they
seek to decide. It is unlikely that, before
they commenced to read the landslide of
documents on these regions, started to
listen to the torrents of words about
them, began to peruse the dozens of maps
describing their geographical, economic
and geological conditions, they had
even absorbed at fourth hand'very much
information concerning them. It is even
probable that one year ago they did not
know the location of the places they now
so hotly debate.”
Regarding Venezia Giulia, Sulzberger
points out that there “Slavs, Austrians
and Italians nervously contemplate a
future still as uncertain today as it was
a year ago. It was then that defeated
Italy and victorious Yugoslavia first com_
menced to pour forth torrents of words
contesting each other’s claims to govern
that mountainous region. These little
peoples—peasants and shipping agents
whose trade has been borne on the seven
seas since before the great republic of
Venice spread its commercial tentacles;
laborers, bankers, innkeepers and mer-
chants —see still before them only a time
of bitterness, uncertainty and racial
jealousies, fanned beyond any instinctive
of indigenous normality by circumstances
beyond their individual control.”
Markham, looking at the picture of
Europe as a whole, arrives at the con-
elusion that the principal remaining cause
of uncertainty among the “little peoples”
is Russia’s desire to dominate her neigh-
bors. This, he declares, is a serious
P. r °¥ err h an d he points to the pos-
sibility it poses of future war.
The inhabitants of Poland, Rumania,
Hungary, Austria, Bulgaria, Yugoslavia
and Greece, says Markham, all “live
under severe strain, which is partly due
to foreign occupational armies, but prin-
cipally to bitter political strife, caused by
the activity of Russian-backed Commun-
ists. The aggressive, expansive might of
Russia hangs over the area as a cloud.
Moscow - inspired Communists maintain
coercive regimes in most Eastern Euro-
pean lands and are trying to set up such
regimes in the others. Consequently
many of the Eastern European people are
filled with a feeling of desperation, lead-
ing either to resignation or revolt. Many
of them want to go away, anywhere, at
any cost. They look upon their own
countries with horror,
and tend to con-
sider any develop-
ment preferable to
the present situation.
They talk not only of
fleeing but frequently
also of war. They
not only ask about
war; many of them
actually want it.
“That may seem
strange, but it is true.
They haven’t yet re-
covered from the last
war. Many of their
cities are still bat-
tered, their roads de-
stroyed and bridges
out; clothing is
scarce and food in-
sufficient. The tears
of thousands, mourn-
ing for war casual-
ties, are not yet dry.
Many war prisoners
haven’t yet returned.
But in spite of that
Eastern Europeans
are talking of an-
other war. And many
who want war know
that they would be
the first victims. They
would immediately
be rounded up and
put in concentration
camps or eliminated.
Their main motive
for wanting war is that they consider the
present situation unbearable. They say
the sacrifices of the last war were useless,
since they resulted in additional slavery
rather than more freedom. They say
that nothing could be worse than what
they are now going through and pre-
dict that there will be no peace until
Russia is forced out of Eastern Europe.
“What does this mean for the world?”
Markham asks. “Will the little nations
plunge us into war?” His answer is
“No. No small State by itself can now
cause an important war. I don’t believe
many Americans are in a mood to go out
and be-killed for the sighs or tears of
the Hungarians or Rumanians. There will
be no major war unless the Great Powers
make it. There are almost as many
people in Russian - dominated Eastern
Europe as in all South America, and
the vast majority hate Russian control
worse than anything else on earth, but
they can’t cause a war now.
“However, the treatment which they
receive from Russia may cause enough
dissatisfaction to keep Europe in turmoil.
Frequent clashes may occur, one group
may fight another, youths may flee to the
mountains, jails may be filled and vio-
lence multiply. Some rebels may make
their way abroad to carry on agitation.
Nationality groups in America will plead
for one or another of the dissatisfied
nations. Even more important, one of the
Great Powers may back one group of
people in agitated countries and another
Power the opposing group. One Empire
may support one little nation against
another, as already happens, since Lon-
don does support Greece, while Russia
supports Greece’s northern neighbors.
The rival claims of Greece and Albania
over Northern Epirus involve Britain and
the Soviets, as the rival claims of Italy
and Yugoslavia regarding Trieste bring
the U.S. and Russia into conflict,
“Thus,” Markham concludes, “although
the little nations themselves won’t cause
war, there can be no genuine peace unless
they are free,”

FINLAND FALLS TO RUSSIA.
Writing in the N.Y. “World-Telegram”
Ludwell Denny states that Finland will
fare worst of the ex-enemy States for
whom peace treaties have so far been
drafted. “She is the least guilty of all
former enemy States,” he says, “and the
only democracy, in the Western sense.
She was dragged into the conflict against
public will and as the aftermath of the
earlier Russian war of aggression against
her. But the treaty to be imposed on
Finland is harder than that for Rumania
and Bulgaria.”
Denny makes the charge that the “chief
responsibility for the tough Finnish deal
rests with Russia and Britain, who both
wrote the unjust draft demanded by the
Council of Foreign Ministers. Britain
Washington “Post.”
WELL, WHAT COUNTRY ARE WE LIVING IN
TODAY?”
went along with Russia on most major
points.
“Among provisions which will make
it difficult for Finnish democracy to sur-
vive are the following:
“Of Finland’s scanty territory 13 per
bent, of the total, representing 10 per
cent, of agricultural and industrial pro-
duction, is ceded to Russia. That includes
Petsamo, the Arctic outlet and copper and
nickel centre, as well as Viipuri. Also
she must give Russia a 50-year lease on
the Porkkala area for a naval base just
outside Helsinki, the capital. Loss of the
Porkkala area cuts Finland’s main east-
west road for Swedish traffic. Though
$300,000,000 reparations may sound small
it makes Finland pay Russia a fifth of
her annual national income now. In
view of her economic incapacity, un-
willing default is probable. That would
be the excuse for Russian occupation and
creation of another Puppet Government
in Europe.”
There has been surprised comment in
American newspapers over the fact that
although the U.S. did not declare war
on Finland, and “is a friend of long
standing,” the U.S. delegation in Paris
did not come out more strongly in support
of Finland’s claim to more lenient treat-
ment. The U.S. attempted to support the
Finnish request for a reduction of re-
parations, but “the Russian delegate and
the Czech chairman of the Economic Com-
mission refused to permit introduction of
the amendment.” The U.S. did not even
attend the Political and Territorial Com-
mission session determining Finland’s
fate.
The “World Report” says that “Finland
now can begin to add up the bill she must
pay for fighting at the side of Germany.
The price is to bring her economic and
political troubles for years to come. The
Finns, in defeat, find they must do busi-
ness with Russia on terms that are to
drain a major share of their resources
into the Soviet. Norway, too, claims
reparations. The conclusion is that
the treaty, when finally negotiated, will
saddle the country with a crippling
burden that may prevent its ever re-
gaining pre-war stature.
“Reparations are Finland’s most im-
mediate concern. The Russo - Finnish
armistice billed Finland for 300-million-
dollar reparations in the form of mater-
ials and finished products, delivery to be
made over an eight-year period ending in
1952. As filings now stand, Finland is
almost two million dollars behind in ship-
ments and must pay Russia fines of 5
per cent, for each month deliveries are
overdue. At the present rate, Finland
still will be heavily in debt to Russia
when the reparations deadline is reached.”
The “World Report” sees the likeli-
hood of a permanent tie-up of the Finnish
economy with Russia: “Of long-term
economic importance is the nature of
key reparations. A substantial portion
is in the form of light-engineering pro-
ducts, so the Finns have had to create
virtually a new industry to meet the
quotas. It will not be easy to divert back
to older industries in 1952 the man-’
power and capital absorbed by such
enterprises. On the other hand, the
export prospects for such products in
Western nations is close to nil. The obvi-
ous way out is an increasingly closer in-
tegration of Finnish economy with Soviet
needs, something long desired by Mos-
cow.
“Territorial losses for Finland become
a permanent factor in the planning of
economic restoration. These losses pre-
sent two aspects. They have cost Fin-
land some of its best agricultural land
and valuable industrial areas, and they
have involved the displacement of some
450,000 persons, or almost one-eighth of
the total population. The loss of agri-
cultural and industrial resources cannot
be remedied, but Finland has a major
problem in resettling and housing the
displaced persons.
“The political future, as blueprinted
by the treaty, is of vital importance to
the Finns, who are an intensely independ-
ent people. They look to the Allies to
provide adequate safeguards for the right
of the Finnish people to rehabilitate their
democracy, free of the two pre-war
cliques which brought it to grief. These
were the military faction, which was
anti-Soviet, and the industrial clique,
which saw economic advantages by tying
in with Nazi Germany. Politically, the
Finnish Parliament still meets and, to all
outward appearances, the Government

functions as that of an independent
nation. However, the presence of a Con-
trol Commission predominantly Russian
imposes an obvious handicap. The Gov-
ernment never forgets that the all-im-
portant consideration in any situation is
what Russian reaction may be. Con-
sequently, indirect Russian influence
exerts tremendous weight and may handi-
cap the free development of political
parties in the future.
“Most responsible political leaders real-
ise Finland must march in step with the
Soviet for the foreseeable future. The
integration of Finnish economy into the
Soviet scheme, which reparations now
make necessary, is not likely to end once
Finland has paid off. Thus, during and
after the reparations period, the Finnish
market for foreign goods and services
is to be limited. Finnish exports to
nations other than Russia similarly will
be reduced. Both in commercial and
diplomatic matters, Finland’s dealings
with other countries for the next decade,
at least, can be expected to reflect Soviet
policy.”
In Search of Democracy.
Elections, free, partly-free and com-
pletely controlled, in most European
countries have supplied “signs of the re-
birth of democratic forces,” but they are
no more than signs and, as Harold
Callender pointed out in a review for the
N.Y. “Times,” they “require a great deal
of interpretation.”
Callender declares that “democracy
has never had the same significance in
Europe as it has had in England or the
U.S. It has followed unfamiliar paths.
Moreover, in both defeated and vic-
torious countries its slow, painful rebirth
takes place in circumstances which are
crude and unpromising.”
He remarks on “two great democratic
parties that have come to the top
in France, Germany, Italy, Bel-
gium, Holland and Austria the
Socialists and Christian Democrats, the
latter called Popular Republicans in
France. Both would accept Lincoln’s
definition —government of, by and for
the people. Both believe in Parliamentary
government, but both want much more
than that.
“Socialists see democracy as something
valuable in itself, but especially valuable
as a preliminary to socialism —approxi-
mately the same goal that Communists
seek by different methods. Socialists are
prepared to go slowly. Thus, they are
moderates, and as such are disdained by
Communists. Socialists seem to be in
harmony with the broad trends in Europe
which are toward an increasing measure
of State supervision of economic life.
They represent a characteristic demo-
cratic force but -one that only feebly re-
sists the more vigorous and violent Com-
munist movement in considerable sections
of the working class.
“Christian Democrats repudiate the
materialism of both varieties of Marxism
and of American and British democracy.
They seek a democracy animated by
Christian doctrines as interpreted by the
Catholic Church. They are very critical
of existing capitalism. In France they
urge nationalisation of key industries,
but with compensation to the owners. To
this extent they may be called socialistic.
“It is these two forces,” says Callender,
“that offer whatever hope there may be
for the re-establishment of democracy as
we understand it as against the Com-
munists, who understand it differently.
But the two are not united in any
country, and hence their triumph is
rendered less imminent,”
Andre Visson, writing for the Wash-
ington “Post,” is another who has
searched for portents of democracy in
Europe. He believes that “the crucial
problem, which does not appear on the
agenda of any international conference
but overshadows all problems discussed,
is whether democracy and Communism
can work together.
“When so many people believe that we
will have to live in ‘one world’ there are
few who realise how extremely difficult
it will be to build ‘one Europe.’
Western and eastern Europe have de-
veloped not only different ways of life but
different political philosophies. De-
mocracy has become the cornerstone of
the political philosophy in most of
western Europe. But for eastern Europe
it remains only an ideal.
“Democracy” he describes as “sub-
stantially the political philosophy of the
middle-classes. It can, therefore, func-
tion only in those countries in which the
middle-classes can live a normal life. In
every European country in which the
middle-classes, whether for political or
economic reasons, remained a weak
minority, there was either no democracy
or it was unable to function (Russia,
Poland, Rumania, Italy, Spain and Portu-
gal). In .the countries in which the nor-
mal life of the middle-classes was dis-
organised by economic disorder, such as
inflation (Germany and Austria), the im-
poverished middle-classes were unable to
function politically and socially and
democracy collapsed.
“In Europe on the eve of World War
II democracy existed only in England,
the Scandinavian countries, the Low
Countries, Switzerland and, perhaps.
Czechoslovakia.
Democracy still func-
tioned in France, but
it was pretty sick
and could not stand
the moral shock of
military defeat.”
Today, as Visson
sees it, “democracy
is strong in all the
European countries
where it was strong
before the war.
Furthermore, demo-
cracy is now con-
valescent in France,
where it has a better
than even chance to
recover completely
—despite the great
social danger to the
middle-classes inher-
ent in inflation. It is
also making a re-
markable comeback
in Italy. But in all
the countries of east-
ern or Danubian
Europe, where de-
mocracy was before
the war only an ideal, there is today
infinitely less democratic freedom than
before the war.
“The natural potentialities of de-
mocracy in eastern Europe are now,”
Visson declares, “much greater than they
were before the war, but the political
possibilities are much smaller. Domestic
Communism is not much stronger than
it was before the war. In genuine free
elections the Communists would always
remain a minority, polling from 5 to 25
per cent, of the votes. This is true of
Poland, Rumania, Bulgaria, Yugoslavia
and the Baltic States. But the middle-
classes in these countries, which were
before the war too weak to resist the
pressure of the Crown or the army, are
now too weak to resist the pressure of
the Communist minority, which enjoys
the protection of the Soviet and the Red
Army stationed there.”
N. Y. “Times” writer Anne O’Hare
McCormick finds “Communism making
a well-planned, persistent and powerful
fight for Europe. Democracy is not the
strong competitor. The conflict is being
waged within the framework of socialism,
in the main a new, limited and strongly
' anti-Communist brand of socialism which
finds its most popular expression in a
strangely frontierless movement which
labels itself Christian to distinguish it
from the atheistic socialism of the past.
“Europe seems to be groping toward a
political synthesis suited to its ruined
economy and its difficult political position
between Russia and the Western world.
Its importance in the future may be as
the middle ground between the two
systems —a great, diversified laboratory
in which, if a world synthesis is possible,
it may be worked out.”

(Condensed from various acknowledged
sources.)
It is depressing to find in the U.S. the same
futile behavior patterns in the face of post-war
economic difficulties which are so marked in
Europe —(a) a succession of sporadic strikes,
and (b) the maintenance of a cumbersome sys-
tem of Government controls over the economic
life of the country. In France and in Italy one
could see the same process repeating itself with
a kind of dreary fatalism. There would be a
strike or a threat of a strike, to enforce some
wage demand. Prices would immediately and
almost automatically rise to an extent which
would sometimes more than offset the wage
increase. After a short interval there would
be new wage demands, followed just as surely
by new price increases. None, in the long run,
benefited. People who could not strike, re-
cipients of fixed incomes, holders of Govern-
ment bonds, pensioners, etc., suffered appreci-
ably. Return to normal conditions of free and
abundant supply was retarded. Each strike im-
poverished the country and inflicted incon-
venience upon the general population. One can
understand the discontent of wage-workers in
the face of rising prices and still understand
that neither the direct-action remedy, through
strikes, nor the administrative remedy, through
price-fixing, offers the slightest hope of improv-
ing conditions. \There is one cure for shortage
and the rise in prices which shortage brings as
a consequence. This cure is abundant produc-

tion. It would be difficult to make out a
plausible case for the proposition that either
strikes or bureaucratic controls are an aid to
production. It would be easy to prove that a
very large share of the unsatisfactory results of
post-war reconversions may be attributed to
these two shackles on the normal functioning of
production. Why not try freedom? It could
not conceivably create worse shortages, more
glaring contradictions, more fantastic bottle-
necks. It is only economic freedom, combined
with hard and steady work, that will overcome
the dislocations of the war and recapture the
pre-war standard of living. —William Henry
Chamberlin in the “Wall-street Journal.”

Soviet demands on Turkey may bring an
answer to one problem that disturbs Europe.
This is: how far is the U.S. prepared to go
in defending world order against Soviet im-
perialism? No Europeans—except Communists
and their dupes —question American intentions.
What they question is the determination of the
American people tp defend American principles
by all necessary means, negotiation or appeal
to the United Nations if sufficient; by force if
necessary. Lack of confidence in American
resolution is a powerful factor in current dis-
orders. If Soviet demands upon Turkey clear
up American intentions they will have served
a useful purpose. Those demands aim funda-
mentally at nothing less than the vassalisation
of Turkey. They boil down to two principal
points: first, Soviet-Turkish joint military con-
trol of the Dardanelles; second, the transfer
to Russia of the Kars and Ardahan districts.
Both are unacceptable to Americans and British,
and intolerable to the Turks. Rather than
submit to them the Turks insist they will fight.
It isn’t yet sure that the Soviets intend to push
their demands to the ultimate limits. But they
are following a familiar pattern. Should the
Soviets threaten with military force, the test
will be upon the U.S. Turkey will appeal to
the U.N.O. President Truman and Secretary
Byrnes know well that the U.N.O. cannot
protect a small country against a great Power
armed with a veto. Therefore, a Soviet armed
threat against Turkey will not only test the
U.N.0., it will test the determination of the
American people to oppose aggression. Until
this test has been made, European govern-
ments will remain impatient of verbal American
support. The post-war world is intolerant of
words not backed by the will to action, and
suspicious of power without responsibility. —

Communists ought to be ousted from posts
in the U.S. Government. There may be few
in such posts but that is no excuse for com-
placency. Not one man or woman ought to
have a place of trust in a Government he or
she has sworn to help overthrow. The best
thing about Communists is that they are their
own best antidote. Wherever a people have
had a good chance to come in contact with
Communists, they hate Communism —and we
are not sure that Russia need be an exception.
The danger that the U.S. will drift into some
form of totalitarianism arises not from Com-
munists but from those people who would
■ compromise with Communism, who would have
us believe that there is some halfway house to
freedom, that men in their economic life can
be subject to some conscious control, centrally
administered, and still remain free men. Schemes
of control, attractively clothed, are paraded, and
men who are trustees for the jobs and property
of thousands of citizens lend such schemes their
prestige. They contribute their money and
their time to further a scheme of fiscal control,
which the honest professorial authors frankly
state involves a Government by a committee
of experts standing# above the President and
Congress. The Communist knows what he
wants to do and there is an ample literature
telling plainly what he intends to do if given
the chance. He is less dangerous than people
who are either muddled, dishonest, or both. —

The assiduous industry of our fellow-
travellers has so distorted the picture of
American foreign relations that the issue of
war or peace between the Anglo-American
Powers and Russia is believed by many to lie
exclusively with the American and British
people. That is the party line. Get rid of
America’s pro-British “warmongers,” and we
shall have “peace in our time.” From this
naive paraphrase of 1940 isolationism, one
would hardly imagine that Russia was playing
an active role in the world at all, or doing
anything more than waiting passively to be shot
at like a sitting duck. Nobody in the U.S.
Wants war with Russia. If there is a possibility
of war, it springs from the dangerous and
fatuous activities of our neo-appeasers, who
seem determined to give Stalin the same false
picture of a distracted and divided America
by which another group of isolationists misled
Hitler five years ago. If Stalin can be per-
suaded that we are so hopped up about the
evils of British imperialism as to be indifferent
to the dangers created by Russian expansionism,
and if he is led to believe that America has
abandoned hope for U.N.0., and has followed
the fellow-travellers to a new isolationism, then
it is quite possible that we shall one day find
ourselves confronted with a grim choice be-
tween a totalitarian peace and a show at re-
sistance, without hope and without allies. For
such a bleak outlook we should have to thank
our earnest fellow-travellers, whose fragmenta-
tion activities have already weakened America’s
influence in the international field, — “Saturday
Evening Post.”

In the Berlin elections Socialists got nearly
half the votes, the Christian Democrats coming
second, the Communists, under the name of
the Socialist Unity party, following far behind.
In the British zone the Socialists and Christian
Democrats ran neck and neck,' the Com-
munists being a poor third. In the French
zone the Christian Democrats were in the lead,
the Socialists second, the Communists third.
In Berlin Communists polled about one-fifth
of the votes cast, or less than they lately
polled in France. In spite of all the advan-
tages they have enjoyed in the Russian sector,
the Communists throughout Germany seem far
weaker than they were in the days of the
Weimar Republic.
A similar issue dominates French elections,
but in a very different setting. Germany has
yet to be converted to democracy while France
was a pioneer in democracy, although a con-
siderable section of her people have never
accepted it and do not accept it today. The
problem in France is to mobilise against the
Communists the really democratic forces with-
out letting them get mixed with and confused
by the anti-democratic forces of the Right, which
are, in fact, far older in France than the Com-
munist party. On the Left are the Communists,
who profess to be democrats but who believe
in dictatorship of the proletariat, which means
of their party ; while on the Right are those
who believe in dictatorship of another kind.
To prevent these two groups fighting it out
is the problem French democrats face.
Bulgaria is under control of- the Communists.
So is Rumania. Yet the Russians and other
Communists sing the praises of what they call
democracy in that region. To them democracy
does not mean free speech or free elections. It
means Communist domination in the interest
of the people, for whom Communist leaders
feel better qualified to prescribe than are the
people themselves. Harold Callender in a
review of European elections for the N.Y.

“NEARER, CLEARER, DEADLIER THAN BEFORE.”
“By interfering in South Africa’s relations with its Indian citizens, U.N.O. has paved the way for a challenge to the White Australia policy, which was made the
subject of bitter attacks. Britain, N.Z., Canada and the U.S.A. opposed the vote of censure on South Africa, which was ordered to settle its dispute with In la an repor
to U.N.O.; the Australian delegation, under orders from its ‘Government,' abstained from voting."

SELLING THE PASS.
In the confusion of domestic troubles
and distractions, few Australians can
have spared a thought for what is
happening in the United Nations
Organisation, of which the British
Dominions are original members. Yet
what has happened in U.N.O. during
the past fortnight intimately con-
cerns every Australian, and none more
so than members of trade-unions which
have surrendered to Communist control.
In two instances it has been laid down
that the General Assembly is entitled to
meddle in the internal affairs of British
Dominions. Thus early in its career
U.N.O. has taken a stand which the
League of Nations never ventured to
take.
General Smuts, representing the Union
of South Africa, went to the latest series
of U.N.O. meetings with a proposal that
South-West Africa should be incor-
porated in his Union. For this he had
the support of the great body of natives
in South-West Africa. As he said, these
natives have been under Union control
for a longer period than they were under
German control, and without any such
war as the Germans waged against the
Hereros, He could say also, as he did,
that in the course of 31 years South-
West Africa had become an integral part
of the Union, united to it by railways,
brought into its schooling system and in-
cluded in all its measures for the eco-
nomic advancement of the native peoples.
The old statesman could say also, as he
did, that annexation with the consent of
the natives was necessary to the defence
of the Union. And no' doubt he pointed
out (though this part of the South
African case was not reported) that pre-
cedents had been furnished by the Rus-
sian annexations of the Kuriles, East
Prussia, East Poland and Bessarabia and
part of Finland, to say nothing of the
obliteration of the Baltic republics.
Nevertheless, the incorporation of
South-West Africa in the Union was re-
fused. Refused at the instance of the
Indian delegation, which is headed by a
person with Communist sympathies,
in reversal of “a sub-committee vote
banning annexation now but leaving the
question open for later consideration.”
U.N.O. went further. Again at the in-
stance of the Indian delegation, which
was supported throughout by the Com-
munist Slav-circus, South Africa was con-
demned on the score of its treatment of
the Indians admitted to the Union, 85
per cent, of whom are South African
citizens, and who, under an Act of 1946,
are to have five representatives in the
Union Parliament and two in the Pro-
vincial Council of Natal, where most of
them live. These Indians have been ac-
cused of “defying the laws of the land,
inciting the native and colored popula-
tions, fostering overseas opposition to
the incorporation of South-West Africa
and falsely and maliciously alleging op-
pression and cruelty by the Government
and people of South Africa”; but the
U.N.O. majority dismissed these counter-
charges, accepting everything the Indians
alleged as gospel truth. It even refused
a Smuts offer to let the case go to - the
International Court of Justice.
Here the Australian Government was
guilty of a base betrayal of the sister-
Dominion on an issue-as vital to white
South Africans as the White Australia
doctrine is to us. A three-fifths majority
was required for the resolution censur-
ing the Smuts Government for “discrimi-
nation against Indian citizens”- and
calling on South Africa and India to
“settle their differences and report to the
General Assembly next year.” The three-
fifths majority would not have been ob-
tained had Australia sided with South
Africa, as did Britain, Canada, New Zea-
land (whose Carl Berendsen “made a
forceful speech”) and the U.§.A. Under
orders from Canberra, the Australian
delegation did not vote. Australians will
have cause to rue this pigeon-livered
apostasy.
What U.N.O. can do if annexation of
South-West Africa is decreed and if inter-
ference in the domestic policy of the
Union is rejected may not have occurred
to it, but it may have to reckon with both
problems, if not with a withdrawal of
South Africa from U.N.O,
Australia’s turn came when its delega-
tion submitted a draft trusteeship agree-
ment for New Guinea. Here again the
Indians turned nasty, and they were sup-
ported by Mexico, for once recreant to
Dr. Evatt, with Russia as “their powerful
champion and protector.” Of the Rus-
sian attitude the New York correspondent
of the Adelaide “Advertiser” has
written:
Always seeking an opportunity to pose
as patron of the disinherited, the Russians
have lost no opportunity to discredit the
Australian delegation on New Guinea.
Their most telling thrust perhaps is the
blandly-expressed hope that it will not take
Australia as long to raise the Papuan from
the Stone to the Bronze Age as it once
took humanity as a whole. Clever man-
oeuvring by the Russian and Asiatic groups
has caused Australia to lose some of the
popularity it enjoyed at San Francisco. It
is now whispered in U.N.O. lobbies that
Australian liberalism is merely a cloak,
to be put off as convenient.
Nor were the Russian and Asiatic
groups without support from an unex-
pected quarter;
Mr. Dulles, American representative on
the Trusteeship Committee, ranges himself
with Russia against the British Common-
wealth on colonial questions. He con-
siders that if South Africa were permitted
to defy the United Nations the way would
be open for a third world war. He be-
lieves Australia similarly is not meeting the
trusteeship standards demanded by world
opinion. Among American liberals and
negroes feeling runs high.
It will be awkward if Liberia lodges a
U.N.O. indictment against the U.S.A. on
the score of its treatment of negroes.
By way of conforming to U.N.O. re-
quirements, “Professor Bailey, on behalf
of Australia, introduced a new article
assuring the New Guinea natives of a
progressively increasing share in the
Territory’s administrative and other ser-
vices, and guaranteeing them freedom of
speech, of the press, of assembly and of
worship.”
This did not satisfy the Indians, who
“attacked the White Australia policy.” In
reply Professor Bailey pointed out that
“an article in the draft agreement pro-
vides for equality in economic and
social treatment of all U.N.O. members.”
Thereupon an Indian amendment de-
manding safeguards against racial dis-
crimination was rejected; but the voting
was significant; 11 for the Indian amend-
ment, 16 against, 11 abstentions and 16
absentees.
When William Morris Hughes con-
siders these U.N.O. manoeuvres and sur-
renders, his thoughts must be bitter. He
remembers, no one more vividly, how the
White Australia doctrine was challenged
by the Japanese at the Paris Peace Con-
ference in 1919 in the process of present-
ing a demand for racial equality. Their
Baron Makino tried to have the following
clause inserted in the Covenant of the
League: —-
, The equality' of nations being a basic
principle of the League, the High Contract-
ing Parties agree to accord, as soon as pos-
sible, to all alien nationals of the members
of the League equal and just treatment in
every respect, making no distinction, either
in law or fact, on account of their race
or nationality.
The voting was 11 for and 6 against;
but, thanks chiefly to Mr. Hughes, “it was
ruled that unanimity was necessary.”
Japan is no longer in a position to raise
the question of racial equality, which
implies supreme rights of emigration to
the country or countries chosen; but far
more formidable advocates have swarmed
into the breach. There is India, no
longer a loyal part of the British Empire,
but, as Mr. Nehru, that half-Communist,
will have it, “an independent republic” ;
a horse of another color, which is feel-
ing its oats. There is China, now labelled
one of the Big Five, and with a history
of emigration which in the course of a
few years compelled Australians and
Western Americans to resort to extreme
measures to stem the tide and preserve
their countries for the white man. There
is Indonesia, that other Japan in the mak-
ing, whose seamen have found Australia
a favored land.
And there is 'Russia, supreme over
great parts of Europe and Asia, and with
Communist parties throughout the British
Empire. Its agents in Australia have
forced their Indonesian policy on the
“ ‘Labor’ Government,” even to the extent
of wresting an export licence for the film
“Indonesia Calling,” a pictorial witness
to the “ ‘Labor’ Government’s” abasement
and its betrayal of the white man’s cause,
to which it still gives lip-service now and
then.
One certain result of these U.N.O. pro-
ceedings is that Asiatics will press for un-
restricted immigration into Australia, as
well as its territories. It is equally certain
that the first shock will be felt by the
unions which have surrendered to Com-
munists and their “black, brown and
brindle” philosophy; these seamen,
wharflaborers, dockworkers, ironworkers,
clerks and the rest. For history has its
savage ironies, and it will go on the record
that “Labor,” whose supporters had most
to lose, sold the pass to the alien for the
simulacrum of power.
Changing the Japs.
As reported, Cardinal Gilroy returned
from his fortnight’s visit to Japan very
pleased with what he had seen there, and
with his admiration for General Mac-
Arthur heightened. He had found the
Emperor “a humble and very pleasant
man, anxious for amity with Australia,”
a feeling discerned in Japan as a whole ;
“a land of order, where the people are
resigned to their fate,” There was no
shortage of food, and he “did not once
see a scowling face.”
The Cardinal would not be unaware
that surface appearances, observed on a
fortnight’s visit, could be deceptive.
Many acute observers, after years of
close study on the spot, have declared
themselves baffled by Asiatic inscrut-
ability. It is no myth ; his striking ability
to penetrate it and understand the Asiatic
mind has been General MacArthur’s
special qualification, tested and found
sound both in his warring against the
Japs and shaping the peace of their
country.
That Cardinal Gilroy should have
found Japan “a land of order” at present
is evidence that General MacArthur's
control has been succeeding more notably,
if that is possible, than his war-waging
command. It is a success achieved despite
the snipings of Communists anxious to do
the Kremlin’s work there, as elsewhere,
and of others anxious, perhaps, for
nothing more than personal limelight.
But the wise temporary ruler would
probably be the last to suggest that the
job of changing the Japs from what they
were known to be in war to what we
would like to have them in peace is more
than barely begun, or that even what has
so far been achieved in that respect has
certain permanence.
As with Germany and Italy, great
changes have been forced on Japan;
changes so dramatic and sweeping that,
taking the time of their accomplishment
into account, their like cannot be found
in history ; nor can anyone forecast what
their ultimate effect may be. The Cairo
Agreement, to the terms of which Japan
surrendered, has yet to be fully worked
out for China, but for Japan, in little
more than a year, it has been brought
home with shattering completeness. The
contrast between the Japan Cardinal
Gilroy saw in his brief visit and the
Japan that straddled the. Pacific and Asia
right down to Australia’s northern rim
and across to India is so extraordinary as
to seem incredible ; and maybe incredible
could be the right word for it yet.
The Japs struck when the force that
might have been opposed to them was
elsewhere engaged or was unready ; even
so, the Jap success was amazing and the
temporary conquests enormous. For its
brief hour the Jap empire stretched out
from the home islands to Formosa,
Korea, Kwantung, Manchukuo and
occupied-China ; this last, in the strangle-
hold, really China itself. The Jap hordes
swept down over French Indo-China,
Thailand, the Philippines, Malaya, Burma,
the Netherlands East Indies, Borneo,
Timor, New Guinea, the Solomons,
Ocean Island, Nauru and Guam. In
actual land the occupied empire covered
over 3,000,000 square miles bolding more
than 400,000,000 people. It has all gone ;
every acre of it. Japan is once more a
small group of densely-populated islands
•isolated off the coast of China, and, for
the present, once more isolated from and
by the world.
The analogy has been drawn between
this Japan of today and the Britain of
centuries ago, by way of pointing the
warning that an isolated insular people
can rise again to dominance. It is, how-
ever, not an exact analogy. The isolated
Britain had not gained and lost an empire.
The gaining was yet ahead, and the British
Empire, because the British were as great
colonisers as they were adventurers and
conquerors, was to outlast the loss of
even huge parts of it, and become the
original pattern of the international order
that U.N.O. has been hopefully set up to
attempt to fashion out of Babel, The
parting, in India and elsewhere, is still in
process, but Britain, Canada, South
Africa and the Pacific Dominions re-
main: together a great World Power,
provided only that they stand together—
and be ready to start together at a drop
of the hat.
That former Britain, too, was not an
occupied country, after unconditional
surrender. It was not being made “a land
of order” by foreign dictation. Nippon
has not only been stripped of empire but
has itself been stripped. Its navy, army
and air force have been done away with.
All that military might, so formidable on
the crest of conquest, so wedded to a
superstition that it seemed unconquerable
this side of extermination until the right
order came from the right quarter, is now
nothing. The battleships have gone as
war prizes or been used as bomb targets ;
the army’s millions have been deprived
of arms and told to be civilians; the
Zeros and suicide-planes have been turned
to scrap and the airfields not wanted for
the occupation have been ploughed under.
On that physical side, also, war indus-
tries are being transformed to purposes
of peaceful living, and the whole of the
hitherto largely militaristic Jap life is in
process of being headed in the same direc-
tion. Secret police and secret societies
are being broken up ; on the score of
their past militarist activities an entire
class of previously controlling officials
have been banned from Government and
public*positions. And even these great
changes, brought about by a succession
of Mac Arthur orders, are not the greatest,
nor is any of them of the most striking,
unpredictable, significance.
Just about this time only a year ago—
on December 15 —General MacArthur
gave out his order abolishing Shinto as
the national religion of Japan. The idea
of abolishing a national religion by edict
sounds preposterous, but the order was
to have a telling sequel. The order for-
bade propagation of “the doctrine that
the Emperor of Japan is superior to the
heads of other States because of ancestry,
descent or special origin”; ailso “the
doctrine that the people of Japan are
superior to the people of other lands be-
cause of special or divine origin.”
The sequel came in Hirohito’s rescript,
broadcast last New Year’s Eve. The ties
between Emperor and people, the amaz-
ing broadcast announced, “do not depend
upon mere legends and myths. They are
not predicated on the false conception
that the Emperor is divine, and that the
Japanese people are superior to other
races and fated to rule the world.” The
broadcasting voice went on to strike off
“the shackles of militarism, of feudalism,
of regimentation of body and soul.”
There was an end of “thought-control
and the abuse of education” ; in their
place “religious freedom and the right of
speech” and of assembly. It was neces-
sary “for the masses of Japan to awaken
to the fact that they now have the power
to govern, and what is done must be
done by themselves.” “It is my hope,”
Hirohito concluded, “that the New Year
may be the beginning for them of ‘the
way and the truth and the light.’ ”
What those words shattered was some-
thing on the spiritual plane as vast as the
stripped-off empire had been on the
physical level. Until then the Emperor
was to his people no mere temporal ruler
but a divinity. That was the driving force
behind the Jap militarist fanaticism. It
was the power which, at the laying down
of the word, had caused the fighting Japs
to lay down their arms wherever the
word had been heard. What the Japanese
people heard in the broadcast rescript was
that power committing spiritual hara-
kiri. It was the godhead of a faith not
being done away with by foreign edict,
but doing away with itself.
What Cardinal Gilroy saw in Japan
might not have been a people resigned to
their fate, but a stunned people. They
had gambled for a world, and lost —at
least for the time being; their slogan
of “Asia for the Asiatics” is still in force,
not weakening, and the ultimate end of
that is beyond prediction. They had not
staked their religion, but that would seem
to have gone, too, as far as Emperor
divinity carries. This is the nadir of the
change in Japan. For the present there is
nothing in its stead, but that is a kind of
vacancy that is always filled. In time
the foreign occupation will end ; by when
Japan may be a democracy under an
Emperor, after the pattern of the British
monarchy. It may even by then be, as
churchmen are hoping, Christianised. As
to which possibilities, Thucydides wit-
nessed the world’s original democracies
warring against one another to destruc-
tion and left an instructive record of it;
and being Christianised has not prevented
aggressive peoples from embarking on
barbarous wars.
PLAIN ENGLISH
This Low Tammany Game.
In continuation of the process of dump-
ing defeated “Labor” politicians on the
taxpayers, whose terrific burdens are
breaking them, Federal “Labor” has
appointed a Mr. John Patrick Breen
Trade Commissioner in the Middle East,
salary and headquarters unstated.
Before he entered “Labor” politics
as M.H.R. for Calare (N.S.W.), Mr.
Breen was a publican, and no
doubt the Trade regards his appoint-
ment as a compliment, and as a
return for favors rendered, while wonder-
ing with some concern where his head-
quarters will be —Cairo is no longer a
British garrison town and Tel-Aviv is
an even more unhealthy spot. But from
other quarters came protests so
strong that Mr. Chifley was impelled to
attempt some sort of justification, which
he did in clumsily flippant terms:
Mr. Breen is over 21, intelligent, and has
had a fair amount of training in educa-
tional matters. He has taken a grfeat


interest in community affairs generally, in-
cluding questions of primary production
and that sort Of thing.
This could be said with greater force
(“intelligent” is unctuous flattery) of
thousands of other Australians whose
claims were never considered. All have
had war service, many in the Middle East,
to which Mr. Breen is a total stranger.
But in these cases war service is a dis-
qualification.
During the same week it came out
that the High Commissioner at Ottawa,
Mr. Alfred Stirling, was being shifted to
Washington as Minister, to serve under
the “Ambassador,” Mr. Makin. He had
done his Canadian job well, but he had
to get marching orders to make room
for Mr. Forde. With an Ambassador
and a Minister at Washington there will
assuredly be a sinecure for one party.
A “Find the ‘Pea’ ” competition is not
suggested, since everyone would know the
answer.
Tricks that Are Vain.
For ways that are dark and for tricks
that are vain Bret Harte’s heathen
Chinee had nothing on the Russian per-
formers at U.N.O. Whether the Rus-
sians had any packs up their sleeves, or
were really childlike and bland, or were
performing that way from sheer cussed-
ness or from national internal pains, has
not been disclosed.
Whatever the cause, the performance
all through on the disarmament question
was quite fantastic. It read like the try-
ing of bluffs that an imbecile would
scarcely have tried; each bluff being
called and at once replaced by another.
The latest had to do with a Russian
demand for an accounting of all armed
forces. This appearing acceptable on
condition that home-based troops were in-
cluded in the census the Russians ob-
jected, after having earlier agreed! Evi-
dently it had dawned on the Russians
that such inclusion would show how
close Mr. Churchill’s figures of Russia’s
armed forces in and near bordering
countries were to the truth.
The Russians also found another ob-
jection—to the British proposal that an
international inspection board should be
established to verify the census. If there
was any sense of humor present there
must have been loud laughter at the ob-
jection throughout U.N.O. The idea of
such a census without inspection to verify
it would upset the gravity of a synod of
statues.
In another field —atomic control —the
Russian performance on the same lines
accounted for the U.N. Commission be-
ginning the first two clauses of its pro-
posed treaty with an emphatic “com-
plete” :
Complete powers for international
authority for administering the treaty;
Complete freedom of inspection.
It was not an accident that those
clauses came first, before the clauses deal-
ing with prohibition of manufacture of
atomic weapons and disposal of existing
stocks. The “complete” clauses were put
in first to call the Russian bluff. The
proposed treaty is an American plan,
sponsored by Mr. Baruch, a Jew who
has earned his international celebrity. It
would ensure prompt reporting—through
inspection—of any violations, and no use
of the veto to protect violators. If such
playing of the cards leads nowhere, the
world will know where the blame lies.
Evattism and Wardism.
Professor Bailey is one of Dr. Evatt’s
chief advisers and has his full confidence.
Arguing at a U.N.O. sub-committee meet-
ing for the trusteeship agreement for New
Guinea which is to take the place of the
League mandate the doctor’s substitute
had to defend Australia against the
attacks of Indians, and of Communists
from Moscow, Minsk and Belgrade. The
White Russian gentleman demanded the
insertion of “a new article requiring Au&-
tralia to develop free organs of repre-
sentation for the people of New Guinea,”
those Stone Age children, and “to take
all appropriate measures for their political
development, under the directorship of
the Trusteeship Council.”
Dr. Evatt’s deputy was baited into
repeating what the doctor had himself
said, that for upwards of 20 years Aus-
tralia had “carried out its task in New
Guinea to the satisfaction of the world,
and to the native inhabitants, as their
loyalty during the Japanese invasion
visibly demonstrated.”
A true bill, and, with Britain, Canada,
New Zealand and the U.S.A. rallying
round, the White Russian “amendment”
was defeated by nine votes to six, but the
Russian, White Russian and Yugoslav
objectors will, no doubt, come again when
they learn that Mr. Ward is revolutionis-
ing labor conditions in New Guinea on
the ground that the natives were enslaved
under the mandate, and has turned a lot
of benevolent ladies and professors loose
to “emancipate” Brown Brother, with,
no doubt, missionaries from the Sydney
Trades Hall to follow.
Economic results of Wardism have been
pithily summed up by R. W. Robson in
a letter to “S. M. Herald”;
Normally New Guinea produces 75,000
tons p.a. of copra, now worth £3O a ton.
Because the New Order has virtually banned
native labor and crippled the plantations,
copra production is not now 10,000 tons a
year. Today Australia wants every ounce
of gold she can get. Normally New Guinea
produces gold worth £2,000,000 a year.
Because the New Order has deprived us
of transport and native labor, the Territory
is producing no gold.
Mr. Robson dryly observed that al-
though ladies and other theorists, anthro-
pologists and the like, were on “the panel
of so-called experts to advise Mr. Ward,
not one experienced planter, goldminer
or trader was consulted.” Of course, as a
Sydney “Labor” politician with an in-
eradicable Russia-Is-Always-Right bias,
Mr. Ward couldn’t seek the advice of
those whom he branded as “exploiters,”
many of whom added to their offences by
serving in the “imperialist war.” Before
the Japanese struck at New Guinea, he
sneeringly said that the “exploiters”
should defend it themselves, and made this
the subject of a Defence Act amendment.
Defend New Guinea they did, to the best
of their ability, and in the process won
golden opinions from the American and
Australian armies, as scouts, guerrilla
fighters and recruiters and trainers of his
“Fuzzywuzzy angels,” only to be reviled
as bolters by Mr. Bryson, then “Labor”
member for Bourke and now Ministerial
secretary to Mr. Chambers, Mr. Forde’s
successor as political head of the Army,
who supported the Bryson slander.
It was Macaulay who wrote that the
Puritans hated bear-baiting not because it
THE GENIE OUT OF THE BARREL.
“Ex-publican Breen, the defeated ‘Labor’ M.H.R. for Calare (N.S.W.), has been appointed
Trade Commissioner in the Middle East. There is already a Trade Commissioner in Cairo.”
gave pain to the bear, but because it gave
pleasure to the spectators. Mr. Ward’s
ideas on New Guinea are somewhat
similar. He doesn’t really care two straws
for the natives, but he hates the white
colonists, and it will give him exceeding
satisfaction if his New Order ruins them.
After what happened at U.N.0., the
white frader can consider his occupation
gone.
Blind, Deaf and Heartless.
With the need -as great as it ever was—
the British are in the depths of the bitter
northern winter and are sharing their
meagre rations with ruined people in
Europe—the Lord Mayors of Melbourne
and Sydney have had to announce the
closing of their Food-for-Britain appeals
because donations have fallen away to
a trickle. Both have made strenuous
efforts to keep the funds going. Appeals
to State Governments brought £25,000
from Victoria, £12,000 from Queensland,
and £lO,OOO from Westralia. Asked for
help twice in a year, the Sydney “Labor”
Government, whose leader may be the
King’s representative at Canberra, made
no response. Like “Labor” in Canberra
it is deaf and blind to the plight of our
kinsfolk—or does Sydney and Canberra
“Labor” recognise the British as kins-
folk?
What the closing of the funds will
mean to the British people is shown by
the record of the one in Sydney. With
£lO,OOO from the City Council and vast
sums from generous donors, it filled 26
Royal Navy and 16 merchant vessels with
food. There was no freight charge for
R.N. ships, and a total of £15,853 for
the merchant ships was met by the British
themselves. The fund was able to de-
liver every 100 tons of food in Britain
for an overhead cost of 16s.
Sydney’s Lord Mayor, announcing the
closing of his fund, said bitterly that it
had been offered large amounts of
freight space free but had no more
money. Melbourne’s Lord Mayor re-
marked that “the final shipment of gift
food by this fund will leave about the
end of January.” About the same
time Britain’s Food Minister, Mr.
Strachey, announced that Britain would
face “a most critical food situation” in
the next six months.
Lord Mayor Connelly’s hope that pri-
vate people will increase the sending of
gift parcels of food will be fulfilled. The
flood of such parcels shows no signs of
slackening, and Australians, despite the
churlishness of their Commonwealth
Government, will be anxious to do more.
The attitude of the Canberra “Labor”
and Sydney “Labor” Governments is be-
yond understanding. The Canberra show
actually cold-shouldered the sending of
food. It stopped the surrender of
coupons, for which the N.Z. Labor Gov-
ernment expressly asked, by refusing to
make their value in food available.
Repeatedly asked in the House to make
a national food gift to Britain Mr. Chifley
returned a callous “No!” Every time his
Government is twitted about its failure
it puts up some Minister (the latest was
Mr. Pollard) with the flyblown excuse
that lack of shipping stops it from even
sending the food Britain is prepared to
buy. Yet last month the British Food
Minister told a Melbourne “Herald”
man in London that Britain could supply
all the shipping, refrigerated and other-
wise, necessary to lift all the food Aus-
tralia could provide. Last week the
liner Qjrmonde arrived with 5000 tons of
sand ballast in her holds and expects to
have it still on the voyage to Britain,
, But this mean and ungracious “Labor”
Government isn’t above accepting the
credit for the generosity of private citizens.
In many an Australian home there is a
heartrending letter of thanks from some
British recipient of a gift parcel. Many
British people, not' knowing whom to
thank, have expressed their gratitude to
the Prime Minister, supposing in their
innocence that the Australian Govern-
ment was behind the whole thing. And,
though every letter should make him
blush with shame, Mr. Chifley hands them
to the press and sits back with the credit.
Inching Forward.
Queensland Labor has produced a bill
designed to give the State Industrial Court
new powers, among them intervention
where a grievance is reported before it
develops into an “industrial dispute.”
Other provisions:
Two weeks’ annual holidays—three
weeks for shift-workers. A week’s sick
leave for every year worked, to be allowed
to accumulate for two years. Ten-minute
smoke-ohs, morning and afternoon.
For persons or concerns that fail to re-
port a grievance or dispute immediately:
presidents and secretaries of employers’ or
employees’ unions, fines of £5O; individual
employers, up to £5O; companies, up to
£200; an employee whose union is not a
party to the dispute, up to £lO. The Court
may order a ballot in certain circumstances,
unions to supply it with complete names
and addresses of members, employers to
keep a register of employees, their callings
and unions.
Minister Gair, introducing the bill, said
“there are factions that appear to have no
other purpose than to create dissension
and industrial upheaval No set of
conditions would appease or satisfy the
union bosses to whom I refer.” Contri-
butions to the debate came from Aikens,
the Mundingburra mudslinger “the
secret ballot is the refuge of the crook
and the coward”—and from Paterson,
the Bowen Communist—“the workers
expect legislation for a 40-hour week and
a basic wage of £6 Bs.” The Opposition’s
main contention was that the bill
would fail without real enforcement.
Maher (C.P.) wanted an amendment to
provide for a fine of up to £2OO and up
to 12 months’ jail for anybody urging
unionists to disregard a secret-ballot
result.' He was denied it.
The bill was whirled through all stages
after an exchange which just about
summed up its value.
Nicklin (Opposition): No Labor Gov-
ernment in this State has ever imposed
punishment on unions who broke the in-
dustrial laws A fine of £lO will not
stop these men.
Gair: Fines of £lOO or £lOOO will not
stop union leaders calling a strike if they
think it is justified.
Maher: You confess your helplessness,
then.
Gair: You may confess your helpless-
ness, but I do not confess mine.
Fines did not find the U.S. Govern-
ment helpless. On the contrary, they
smashed a coal strike, the leader proving
a man of straw.
Queensland, still resentful of the meat-
works and the coal strikes, very sore
about the chronic wharf stoppages,
hard hit by drought and taxation
and other things, greeted the Gair
measure with a cynical “we’ll see how
she goes,” remembering that next year is
a State election year.
Slugging the Motorist.
The Canberra crowd made a great fuss
about the penny-a-gallon reduction in
petrol tax, and with the general increase
in vehicles and mileage it will get back a
darned sight more than it will lose. Total
petrol tax in the year ended June 30,
1946, was over £12,000,000, of which the
States got about £3,300,000 under the'
roads agreement. The rest went into
consolidated revenue.
Since June, 1939 j the total gain to con-
solidated revenue from petrol tax is over
£51,000,000, most of it got in years when
petrol was severely rationed. With the
r|tion now more than double, and likely
to be lifted altogether as soon as Can-
berra can find other jobs for the fuel-
control staff—it’s a bit tough just now,
since beaten politicians are crowding the
vacancies—the consolidated-revenue share
of the tax could easily run into
£20,000,000 a year.
It has been worked out by motor
authorities that a tax of 6d. a gallon
would return about £9,000,000, less than
half of which would meet Federal road
aid to the States. The motor industry
probably employs more people than any
other industry in Australia. Under a
sane Government it would be encouraged,
by reduction of taxation in the main, to
expand and employ still more. But sanity
in government is a thing of the past in
this country, except in South Australia.
Brisbane Scratches.
From “Uncle M.D.”:
Brisbane is enduring its worst mosquito
season for many years. Countless hordes of
the “black bush” species (Aides vigilax in
scientific terminology), carried on prevailing
winds from their breeding-places in salt swamps
and creeks mainly round Moreton Bay fore-
shores, make life a misery in gardens and
verandahs. With a windborne range of 50 miles
or more they can be eradicated only by exten-
sive and costly reclamation works. They could,
however, be controlled effectively and immedi-
ately at relatively small cost by spraying their
breeding-places from a plane with insecticidal
chemicals of the kind used against malaria-
carrying mosquitoes in N.G. Long ago all their
breeding-places within wind-range of Brisbane
were located and mapped, and the records must
still be available. So far, this daring modern
idea does not appear to have occurred to the
City Fathers.
Should the sorely-tried citizen seek refuge
within, other kinds of flying bloodsuckers are
waiting there for his blood by day and night.
In addition to their nuisance-value some of
them can infect their victims with disease.
Aides cegypti, one of the commonest and most
annoying, is the host and conveyor of dengue
and of yellow fever as well. Brisbane has
been temporarily crippled more than once by
dengue epidemics. Should yellow fever ever
be introduced, as it might be in these days
of rapid communications, the results could be
disastrous. Culex fatigans, hungriest of biters
by day or night, is the principal carrier of
filarial disease. Half a dozen other species
can also make indoor life intolerable to the
tender-skinned.
These particular pests are mainly the fault
of the householder himself for allowing them
to breed on the premises in tanks, gully-traps,
gutters and other collections of unprotected or
untreated water. A single section of sagging
roof-gutter can supply winged annoyances to
any household and its neighbors as well. A
weekly spraying with kerosene will cure any of
them, and the majority can be abolished for
good and all by a Saturday afternoon’s work.
It is nearly 35 years since Brisbane was practi-
cally cleared of domestic mosquitoes by a syste-
matic campaign undertaken by the State Health
Department as a demonstration for the informa-
tion of Queensland local authorities in general.
The procedure included a special gang of
trained men whose services were made available
to householders at cost price of labor and
materials for the rectification of any mosquito-
breeding condition found on their premises.
An unsought proof of its efficiency was pro-
vided by protests from softgoods firms re-
garding the fall in sales of mosquito nets.
World War I supervened, the good work was
never resumed, and now it has apparently been
forgotten in the city of its origin. Records of
its methods and results must still be available
somewhere, and with modern discoveries in
mosquito-killing and mosquito-repelling chemi-
cals the job of freeing Queensland’s capital
from a dangerous and annoying household pest
should be far simpler than it was then.

With gasmen’s strikes in three cities
added to the industrial chaos, and with
wharflaborers and N.S.W. South Coast
coalminers threatening to join dock-
workers and foundrymen in idleness
unless Judges are “disciplined,” or some-
thing like that, the Commonwealth
Arbitration Court, whose decision was
invidiously anticipated, decreed “interim”
increases in the basic wage—7s. a week
on the mainland and 6s. a week in Tas-
mania. Immediately afterwards Chifley
announced a “relaxation” of the Com-
monwealth wage-pegging regulations to
admit of marginal, penalty, shift and
piecework rates being “adjusted.” Union
reactions are unfavorable. Far better
results would have been secured by gener-
ous cuts in taxes, accompanied by a
sweeping reduction of Commonwealth ex-
penditure, which is still 40 p.c. of national
income; but, with the stubbornness of
a weak and ill-informed man, Chifley re-
fuses to yield to either necessity.
From Melbourne “Herald”:
Though the Indian delegation is pleased,
the South African U.N.O. delegates are
upset at Australia’s failure to support them
when a majority vote censured their
country’s treatment of Indians. Britain, the
U.S.A., N.Z. and Canada voted for South
Africa; Australia abstained.
It is bitterly ironical that the practical
legislative statement of the White Aus-
tralia policy was adopted from a South
African measure —Natal’s Immigration
Restriction Act of 1897. Federal Labor,
now so submissive to Indonesians and
their Communist patrons, tried to have
all colored people excluded. It wanted
an exclusion clause inserted in the Im-
migration Restriction Bill, cheering the
“Tory” McMillan when he said he would
prefer separation from the Empire to the
establishment of South Carolinas in Aus-
tralia.
It is no mystery that there is widespread
“Labor” opposition to McKell’s appoint-
ment as Governor-General, but at
the week-end McKell, after a bitter ex-
perience at a Sydney Labor Council meet-
ing, found a champion in Dougherty, of
the A.W.U. Dougherty certified that
“there are very few Australians who
possess the qualifications Mr. McKell
has to represent his Majesty.” And if
the candidate’s position and record as a
“Labor” politician, and his dismissal by
Governor Game on the score of his resist-
ance to Commonwealth law as a Lang
Minister (“illegal action,” in Governor
Game’s expression), may be accepted
as qualifications Dougherty is Right.
After all, N. S. Wales is not to have
two referendums, as well as a general
election, next year. Banking on Opposi-
tion members being, “unavailable,” one
being in hospital, the “Labor” Govern-
ment tried to have the existence of the
Leg. Council put to an Assembly electors’
vote. But the hospital case, E. J. C.
Speck, had himself carried into the
chamber, and with an equal division, 29-
29, on the floor, the President, Farrar,
gave his casting vote to the Noes. He was
himself a “Labor” man once, and
“Labor” helped to put him into the Presi-
dent’s chair after he had supported its
Assembly Pensions Bill. Now all is dust,
ashes and aloes.
A bunch of Persian Communists,
backed by Moscow, staged a revolt and
declared Azerbaijan an “autonomous re-
public.” The Persian Government sent
forces into the area to supervise an elec-
tion. The Corns collapsed, their bosses
hopped over the border to Russia and the
citizenry who’d put up with them for a
year fell upon the residue so vigorously
that they fled to the Government they’d
abused howling for protection. Moscow,
as always when its bluff is called, never
raised ai finger. The “Australian” Com-
munists who dominate our Foreign
Policy and our transport, our general in-
dustry and the production and use of fuel
could be dealt with as swiftly and surely,
and that without recourse to arms —
merely by dint of law-enforcement —
if “Labor’s” backbone wasn’t all jelly.
The “Labor” yoomanitarianism that
saves murderers from the gallows and lets
other violent criminals loose long before
their time (one, Garvie, has committed
the most ferocious crime of the decade)
was made to look sicker than ever last
week. In the space of a few hours, an
inter-State criminal who wound up by
killing an unarmed Sydney detective in
cold blood got a death sentence, which
won’t be carried out, and a reprieved
Queensland murderer and two house-
breakers escaped from Boggo-road, Bris-
bane, one of the housebreakers for the
second time. He and the murderer were
taken on the fifth day, the murderer, when
handcuffed, trying to grab his captor’s
revolver with his free hand. Just as well
“Labor” Governments had to do their
Nippon-fighting by deputy. Their sensi-
tive feelings wouldn’t have permitted
them to shoot or scrag the most fiendish
of our foes.
Queensland’s Parliamentary discussions
of the Foley tobacco incident produced
some novel efforts in the way of oratory.
For example, Hafilon, on the Q.P.P.:
“There is an old saying, ‘Woe hptide the
scandalmonger.’ That is taken from the
Bible.” Unfortunately for the Premier’s
reputation as a student of Holy Writ,
there is no mention of scandal or scandal-
mongers in either of the Testaments —at
least according to Cruden’s Concordance.
Hanlon went on to denounce Opposition-
Leader Pie: (“He was over there as
yellow as a dingo on a back fence”), and
the Opposition itself (“jumping about like
a chimpanzee”). With the Brisbane Zoo
just across the street such similes are
natural enough, however unwarranted.
The Communist dictators of Yugo-
slavia and Albania are going to be
dashed so'fry that they started un-
declared wars against the U.S.A.
and Britain, marked in the one
case by the shooting down of two un-
armed American Army transports and in
the other by the mining of two British
destroyers in the Corfu Channel.
Byrnes’s deputy, Acheson, has given
them notice, and the Communist crowds
in Poland, Rumania, Czechoslovakia and
Bulgaria also, that when U.N.R.R.A.
passes out the U.S.A. will “send no more
relief supplies to countries maintaining
large unproductive armies,” and hitherto
used to - “feed political supporters or
starve political enemies.” Britain will, of
course, adopt the same policy. Neither
country looked for gratitude from any
Communist regime, but they didn’t ex-
pect murder.
“Football pools” are the British,
counterpart of the Australian lotteries,
except that they are not run by the Gov-
ernment. The Government is proposing
to tax prizes—Bs. in the £1 on anything
above £lOOO. Such a proposition, intro-
duced by Chifley, with income tax re-
duced by the amount of the proceeds,
would fill public hospitals with blood-
pressure cases.
A Boulia (Q.) magistrate has ordered
the shire council to employ a man with
four years’ war service as supervisor of
stock routes. A very unusual case: shire
councils, unlike the Commonwealth
“Government” and its departments, have
seldom to be reminded of their duty in
these matters.
A little-known fact about the S.A.
Assembly is that its Standing Orders con-
tain no time-limit on speeches and no
gag clause. Just imagine it —Playford
has been Premier for eight years with-
out even feeling the need to muzzle an
opponent which dominates McKell and
Chifley! No wonder a stout effort is
to be made next April to establish “de-
mocracy” in South Australia.
Westralia once rejoiced in a “poet”
named Tim Breen, who had a regular
formula for ending his effusions: —,
I have the honor to be yours sincerely, Tim
Breen.
Pretty well known from Perth way up to
Nannine.
Now another Breen has been appointed
“Australian Trade Commissioner in the
Middle East” for no other reason that he
is a rejected Federal “Labor” member.
Before he got in for Calare (N.S.W.) this
Breen was a publican. Perhaps the idea
is that he should travel from Dan to
Beersheba peddling the stuff he sold.
The latest illegitimate offspring of
“control” in Melbourne is a black-
market in new potatoes. T. R.
Marriott, president of the Vegetable-
growers’ Association, puts it down to the
fixed price of early potatoes. Many,
growers wouldn’t take the price they had
been receiving when they were sure of a
safer crop in November. Other growers
had other notions, and new spuds
vanished from the legitimate market.
Peter Fraser blotted his copybook
badly when, exulting over his party’s
retention of the four Maori electorates,
which have given it its majority, he de-
clared that “the Maori people have
hurled back the Nationalists as the Maori
Battalion repulsed the enemy on Crete.”
The comparison would have been worthy
of Ward, It was unworthy of Fraser. Not
only Maoris like Colonels Henare and
Awatere and the veteran Apirana
Ngata but servicemen in both the
pakeha parties—and they are well repre-
sented in each —must have resented it, the
Labor Diggers when cool reflection came.
Adelaide was the only city beyond the
N.S.W. borders in which Langism estab-
lished itself for a time, and before it ex-
ploded there were three Lang “parties.”
O’Flaherty, now a Senator, belonged to
at least one of the “parties,” if not two.
In 1931 O’Flaherty stood for. Hindmarsh
as a Lang man and lost his deposit.
Memories of his old allegiance are evident
in his opposition to the Bretton Woods
Agreement, but on one point he doesn’t
follow the old boss. Replying to McLeay,
who said “You are going the right way to
split the. Empire,” O’Flaherty blithered
that “a bloc of nations opposed to Russia
objects to the protective measures Russia
has taken against their machinations, and
.... because of this it is necessary for
Australia to be wary and chary of some
of the international agreements.” A few
weeks previously this woolly-minded
Senator had heard his “Government”
say, in the speech put in the Governor-
General’s mouth, that it “has given, and
will continue to give, unwavering sup-
port to U.N.O. and its related organisa-
tions.”
There has been persistent booming of
Dr. Coombs, perhaps as a preliminary to
the announcement that he is to succeed
Armitage as Governor of the Common-
wealth Bank. The little gentleman is
alleged to have done wonderful things
for Australia at some international con-
ference ;• but the wonderful things aren’t
specified, and there are so many of these
international conferences that the inquir-
ing taxpayer loses track of them. The
proclaimed wonder-worker was a disciple
of the exploded Laski.
Thirty months ago Dr. Coombs, as
Director of Post Whr Reconstruct Son, was
going to do lots of things for ex-service-
men, -women and war-workers, especi-
ally in the housing line. He said' then;
No industry is as antiquated as the
building industry. Here we have a chance
to bring about a revolution. It will take
us two years to catch up on the housing
shortage, despite, the fact that we are plan-
ning a building programme twice as big as
in the best pre-war year.
Ex-servicemen may get a bitter sort of
entertainment reading this projector’s
mush in the garages or stables in which
they are waiting for the houses he was
going to build of airy nothings.
In another confused attempt to do
something about Franco the. Political and
Security Committee of the U.N.O.
General Assembly recommended, and the
General Assembly adopted, “a Belgian
recommendation that all members of
U.N.O. should immediately recall their
Ambassadors and Ministers from Spain
without closing their offices. This in
feeble substitution for a sub-committee’s
“recommendation” that member-nations
should “sever diplomatic relations
with Spain.” Britain and the U.S.A.
know very well that it would take
another civil war to upset Franco. It would
be quite mad of them to support it to
the end that a Communist Government—
probably headed by a criminal lunatic
like Tito or Hotcha or whatever this
Albanian’s name is—could get control
of Spanish military and material sources
and ports.
Maltby, Everard and Michaelis are
back in the Victorian Liberal party
under Hollway’s leadership. They sided
with Macfarlan when that worthy formed
a Ministry, but came to realise, as sensible
men, that the electors had disposed of
the cause of the quarrel by disposing of
Macfarlan., The minority Labor Govern-
ment is struggling into recess, but its out-
look for the next year is distinctly bad.
Go-slow and strikes have earned for
Sydney and Townsville, among shipping
and business circles, the unenviable titles
of the “worst ports in Australia.” The
Townsville position is so bad that ships
won’t enter the port—a ship with 400,000
super, feet of Oregon for Mt. Isa mines
discharged in the south, leaving the stuff
to be carted north by rail, rather than
be tied up in Townsville for months.
Steamers put on since the war to run
regular services from the south to Queens-
land ports are leaving Townsville out of
the schedule. Twitted about it, Queens-
land Premier Hanlon could only drag out
the moth-eaten excuse that there was a
shortage of ships.
Recent election history for “Labor”
politicians to ponder on. September 28,
Federal “Labor’s” majority reduced from
24 (before the Henty and Wimmera by-
elections, 28) to 12; November 24,
Tasmanian “Labor’s” majority reduced
from 10 to 2, and very nearly wiped out
altogether ; November 27, ' Maoriland
Labor’s majority reduced from eight to
four —all Maori members. Duriiig the
first half of next year “Labor” Govern-
ments in N. S. Wales, Westralia and
Queensland must face the electors, and
Victoria’s may. If the Premiers of these
States have been watching the straws
bending before the wind in Canberra,
Wellington and Hobart, they’ve nothing
to feel happy about.,
Australia’s fate is now dreadfully clear.
It narrowly escaped the Asiatic bar-
barians, only to be captured by Bolshies
and bureaucrats.
North Queenslanders no longer believe
that sugar rationing is necessary insofar
as production is concerned although
drought cut sugar crops severely this
year. But there is an uneasy feeling that
Canberra takes refuge in rationing as the
easiest way to deal with the fact that
persistent wharf strikes both at metro-
politan and Queensland coastal ports
have slowed down sugar shipments to
a shocking crawl. At Mackay alone nearly
100,000 tons of sugar has been awaiting
shipment since September, in which
month one ship left partly loaded and
another left empty, owing to wharf “dis-
putes.” To last week Mackay hadn’t
seen a sugar ship since.
When Brisbane’s Lord Mayor Chandler
so far forgot himself as to remark that
large cities contributed more proportion-
ately towards country districts than they
received from them,, the Mayor of
Charters Towers arose ana squashed him
thus: “If Brisbane were barred to
country people, they could live. If the
country were barred to Brisbane people
they’d have to turn cannibals.”

“D. Empson”: With 30 per cent, of
pools guaranteed, specified charities
should do well out of these “Find-the-
ball” competitions—while they last. I
doubt whether competing newspapers
will. An old and sad experience was
recalled when I read that “S. M. Herald”
had given £1506 15s. for a first prize,
£32 11s. more than the “Daily Tele-
graph,” which had got in a day ahead
with its initial result. Lpng ago my old
Sunday rag ran “Limerick” competi-
tions, which were very successful till
narks and squealers began to be heard
from, one set of nuisances averring
that the judging was biased, and
the other that it had sent in the
same last lines as the winners. We bore
with them as patiently as we could until
a nefarious rumor went round the city
that the office poet was winning all the
first-prizes under assumed names. As in
the “Find-the-ball” case, entries cost six-
pence, and with the circulation of the
nefarious rumor the weekly fall in six-
pences, already persistent—there is a
law of diminishing returns in these
matters —became catastrophic. At an
emergency meeting we decided to refute
the nefarious rumor through the Mayor,
an obliging old pot, and by way of prov-
ing that our public didn’t believe a word
of it we announced a substantial increase
in entries. This cost us hundreds of
pounds in the first week, and we had to
go on “putting in” until we came to the
conclusion that the competitions had ex-
hausted themselves, as they certainly had
exhausted us. In the fierce race for cir-
culation these Sydney dailies failed to
realise what they were letting themselves
in for.

“Spokeshave”: It was a surprised Air
Member for Personnel who received this
answer to one of the 100,000 letters of
thanks for services rendered which the
R.A.A.F. has sent out;
I liked the R.A.A.F. very much indeed.
It clothed and fed me better than I had
ever been clothed and fed before, looked
after me in all ways, gave me travel and
social status I would never have had as a
civilian; never was I paid so well, nor will
I ever be again.
The epistle was signed by a flight-
lieutenant who had evidently had a dose
of Chifley’s Golden Age.

“Hackshaw”; A university student who
arranged to sit for an exam at a country
centre 100 miles from Melbourne with a
local parson as bulldog didn’t receive his
papers in time. The thought of a
whole year’s burning of the midnight oil
wasted spurred the parson’s wife, a short-
hand expert, to suggest a way out. The
clergyman put through a trunk-line call,
university h.q. read out the questions, the
wife took them down and the student was
ready to begin just as the examiners
shouted “off” to the thousands of as-
pirants in the city.

“Bo”: A Sydney businessman has an
office staff, mostly flappers, whose habit
of arriving late every morning and re-
turning late after the lunch hour is
equalled only by the zeal they display in
trying to beat the gun at 1 p.m. and
5 p.m. Recently, modernising and
expanding his office, he bought a lot
of new furniture, which meant a review
of his insurance policy. To assess the
value a man from the company came to
give it the once-over. “Well,” he said,
after he had taken it in, “that’s just about
everything, I think” then, glancing up
at the wall, “You’ve included the clock,
I suppose.” The trump followed the
other’s gaze to the wall, let it rove over
the flappers, who had all stopped typing
to follow the proceedings, then said in a
voice loud enough for them all to hear :
“Oh, nio, I haven’t bothered to insure it
—I can depend on the staff to keep a
good eye on that!”

“Niloc”: Emerging bruised and battered
from the ragshop wherein I had foolishly
sought to buy Christmas presents, I came
upon a shop selling Army Disposal goods.
“An Ideal and Useful Christmas Gift”
caught my eye. It was attached to a com-
bination saucepan and frying-pan with
detachable handles. I entered, and
arrayed before me was a host of good

artillery sights, £2 ; hammers and mallets,

wife, I bought a garbage bin and the
saucepans ; for my nephew, just out of
the Army, “The Yukon Pack,” containing .
mosquito tent, water-bottle, groundsheet,
blanket and mess-tins; for grandpa a
boiler tube ; for myself the artillery sights.
When the family found me labelling the
presents, my wife led the assault. De-
tachable handles, mess-tin and tacks
assailed me until the ambulance arrived.

gift reached pretty well its ultimate ex-
pression in the window of a Sydney
hardware store, where a 14in, jigsaw,
complete with automatic blower, was dis-
played in its polychromatic, transparent
topcoat. Strangely enough, I didn’t
notice a queue of men lined up anxious
to secure these natty gifts for their
wives.

“Chevroford”: Visitors to Melbourne
who want to see something of native life
and customs are now taken to Colling-
wood and Fitzroy. Those two suburbs
now contain the largest aboriginal settle-
ment in the State. High war-time
wages lured these natives from Lake
Tyers and other country centres;
most of them are unskilled and all are
now unemployed ; nobody knows what to
do with them, and few of them want to
return to the Government reservations.
They are for the most part simple, gentle
creatures who are interested in the Tests
just as much as their white fellow-Aus-
tralians. Their unspectacular case might
interest people who have been fighting the
cause of the abo. in the outback, who is
alleged to be endangered by the rocket
experiments.

“Atchoo”; “Qwert Yuiop” (B.
20/11/ ”46) may be right in thinking that
Brisbane is unique in blaming jacarandas
for hay-fever, but almost every city
blames some kind of tree for the same
offence. Adelaide has had a very fine
avenue of plane-trees under suspicion for
years. The evidence is not strong
enough for a conviction, but the
private prosecutors all seem to know
someone who knows a professor who
believes that the plane-trees are guilty
of making the public sneeze. The
nasal irritation may be caused by
any one of a hundred kinds of dust, but
it is interesting to note how sentiment
can sway the verdict. One lady who
demanded that the whole row of trees
should be uprooted was assured by a
specialist that her posh fur coat was the
real culprit. Did she stop wearing the
garment? Well, how could any woman
be allergic to a fur coat?

“Oxmead”: The Lord Chamberlain’s
recent activities in London, when he
banned certain lines in a revue song re-
flecting unkindly on two or three Minis-
ters of the Crown, remind me of a hap-
pening in the early ’nineties when the
holder of that exalted office came off
very badly in a similar exercise of his
prerogative. Lord Randolph Churchill
(Winston’s dad) had gone on an expedi-
tion to the newly-colonised Mashona-
land, and his characteristic impishness on
the voyage to the Cape had caused a lot
of comment in the home press. A music-
hall about “Randy-pandy” and his capers
made an immense hit, and the L.C. of
the period came down on it with a heavy
foot. It was withdrawn, but a revised
version > where the name of “Jack the
dandy” was substituted for the original
title, caused more merriment still. I recall
one verse of it:
So I’m only Jack the dandy-o
Of the great Mashonalandy-o,
Since you mustn’t pain
The Chamberlain
By speaking of Randy-pandy-o
For the folks who have commandy-o
In this free and enlightened landy-o
Would license again
Such a play as “Jane”
But not a song about Randy-o.
But my memory fails there. I forget
even what “Jane” was about, but I sus-
pect it would be counted very mild stuff
in these days.

“Hamer”; Since “Jobber” issued the
challenge (B. 27 /11 / ’46), my own
record might be put forward; my first
paragraph appeared 51 years ago in The
Bulletin. The complete tally is: first
par. when I was 14, first joke-gag a little
later, first verse at 15, first short-story
at 17. Many years ago a par. I wrote
under the pen-name “Percy Pawnticket”
brought me a letter urging me to '“have a
go at this bloke ‘Hamer’ ” over some-
thing that had offended the writer.
Jimmy Edmond permitted a “Percy
Pawnticket” par. tearing the tripe out of
“Hamer” to go through, but intimated
that he did not intend that to be a pre-
cedent for allowing a contributor to have
a slang-whanging argument with him-
self. But I am merely a boy yet;
“Jobber’s” challenge may bring to light
others who pre-penned both of us.
“C.E.S.”; My first contribution
appeared in The Bulletin before I
was 14. It was a personal par.
about a ninetyfiver who lived next
door to uS in Broken Hill; it netted
me Is. Bd. Conscience has pricked
me a long time about that par.
In those days the actual cutting had to
be sent in for payment-claim. I had no
money, and always read my Bulletin
in the Broken Hill Municipal Library. I
had cut the par out of the Bully, doing
the dark deed with a pin when there
wasn’t a soul in the newspaper-room.
The crime was never pinned to me, but I
trembled every time I went into the
Library for many months afterwards.

“Spinifex”: Re quaint sayings of
n.c.os, (“Reo Gunner” ; B. 6/11/’46). One
of ours, when riled, used to threaten to
have the victim of his wrath “trans-
planted” to another unit, without the
slightest “irritation.” Once, after care-
fully explaining the mechanism of the
Vickers, he concluded “Well, lads, I’ve
explained all the working parts to you,
and I don’t think I’ve admitted any-
thing.” So far as we could remember
he hadn’t.

“Clooter”: Like a lot of other peopl
I found it necessary to seek time to pay
and, going to the Taxation Department
joined a company of my fellows sitting
like criminals awaiting the clemency o:
justice, on a hard, wooden form fron
which, at various intervals, we went to
our fate one by one. Beside me were
tram-conductor and an honest ole
laborer, both of whom were expressing
astonishment at finding that they had
more to pay than their weekly deductions
had allowed for. I listened to their moan-
ing for a while, then said, “Well, I suppose
you voted for Chifley in the election?’
“Too bleddy right” and “I always vote
Labor” were the replies. “Well,” I said,
“what are y’ growling about? It’s Chif.
who is grabbing your money.” Silence.
Then from the trammie, “Ar, get out.
It’s just them big financial institutions.
They’re doin’ it. Chif. wouldn’t put that
over a workin’ man.” The laborer was
still trying to work it out when I got my
call.

“Findy”; Psychology tests (B.
11/12/ ’46)? Halfway through the war
somebody wished a psychology branch
on the Army and all rookies from then
on were given aptitude tests. Cards were
compiled giving elaborate particulars of
each man’s aptitude, ability and experi-
ence. They showed what type of work he
had done in civil life, what he preferred
to do in the Army, and what the Psycho-
logy branch considered he was best suited
for. He was then sent to the reinforce-
ment pool and ultimately to a unit. The
system might have been all right if it
had started from scratch, but the attempt
to graft it on to an army in being was a
flop. Key positions in all A.I.F. units
were already filled, with plenty of well-
trained men on hand to fill vacancies,
so the reo had to take whatever job was
offering. I recall one classic case. The
newcomer’s card showed that in civil life
he had been (a) a saw doctor and ( b ) a
tractor driver. His Army preferences were
(i) armored divvy and (ii) horse transport.
The Psycho, expert recommended him as
a machine-gunner, and the reinforcement
depot sent him to a field artillery regiment.
He arrived there along with his papers
and was promptly grabbed as a batman.

“Bethune”: Who wants an Old
Master? Just how old is a matter of
debate. In the window of a Sydney art
shop is displayed a painting, showing
signs of wear, depicting a mother and
child. As an inducement to connoisseurs
it is labelled “dated 1885 or 1555.” I’d
have bought it myself, but the years I
collect are 1815 and 1066.

“Yipe”: A resident in our district,
swears that Don Cameron, the P.M.G.,
has produced a miracle. While on his
way to work one morning he discovered
a letter given to him by his wife for
posting some days before still in his
pocket. He rushed at a pillar-box,
uttered a prayer, and, hurling the epistle
at the slot, dived on a passing tram. On
her way to visit his wife the addressee
noticed, when passing the pillar-box, that
her name was on a letter on the footpath.
Acting on the directions therein, she
bought some articles mentioned by the
wife. The lady, amazed at her husband’s
thoughtfulness, praised him accordingly
on his return from work that day. The
nervous twitch he developed is still with
him.
THE CHAMBERLAIN’S OPINION.
“The Lord Chamberlain censored SO lines from a
topical revue song ‘The Left Honorables,’ on the
ground that ‘Ministers of the Crown, whatever party
is in office, should not be exposed to public ridi-
cule.’ ” —London news item.
No limits are assigned to the derision
And mockery with which you may succeed
In covering some gent in high position—
Provided that it’s only meant to read.
Suppose his gaucherie you aim to hammer
And lack of what the French call politesse
And bare acquaintahCe with the rules of
grammar,
It’s safe enough to do it in the press.
But it’s forbid —in England, anyway—
To put such gentle raillery in a play.
Cartoonists, cheerful fellows, risk no strictures
When they delineate a public man
A sort of blend in their engaging pictures
Between (let’s say) Jack Wilkes and Caliban.
They seize upon some dominating feature —
Often a nose or chin, you may remark —
To make their subject just the sort of creature
You’d shudder to encounter in the dark.
But such grotesque distortion wouldn’t do,
You’re asked to keep in mind, in a revue.
We’ve politicians here who join in hearty
Approval, I imagine, of a rule
Exempting Ministers of either party
From being butts for public ridicule.
But there’s no Chamberlain to be dispenser
Of rigid precepts for dramatic shows,
Though books and films sometimes attract a
censor.
And, by the way, can anyone disclose
Why what’s fair dinkum on the printed page
Should be objectionable on the stage?

“Uco”; Who said Mother India has
no sense of humor? The Australian
Trade Delegation, which at the stormiest
season in India’s history is touring that
country with an eye to business, was last
month given an “At Home” by the
Hyderabad Chamber of Commerce. The
Nizam’s district police band was engaged
for the occasion, and as the delegation
arrived it struck up Fucik’s “Entry of the
Gladiators.” As the party ran its merry
course the band dispensed appropriate
music, paused for a space to permit a
singer to render “I’ll Turn to You,” and
brought its programme to a close with
“You’re Driving Me Crazy.”

“R.H.P.”: Tasmania’s good-bye to the
Gloucesters had every indication of
friendship and goodwill. There was not
much of either about the Speck’s fare-
well to Colonel Arthur, one of its early
Governors, This is how “Bent’s News,”
a Hobart weekly, let itself go under the
heading “Rejoice All Ye Lands”;
On every hill there will be a bonfire, in
every window a candle: in every counten-
ance a smile, and every bosom will swell
with joy upon the happy deliverance of
one of the worst Governors under the sun.

“Hackshaw”: I’d describe quiz ex-
perts as rememberers rather than knowers.
Some people have fantastic memories for
births, deaths and marriages, and I knew
one old lady who could repeat the genea-
logical trees of all the members of the
Royal Family. The quiz mind is in-
terested in facts rather than in the rela-
tions between them. Still, there are ex-
ceptions. A schoolmate of mine had a
colossal memory for facts and figures.
A political argument, for instance, would
always bring the discussion round to
the sizes of the navies of the leading
nations. He could not only give the
tonnage of every ship, but its armaments,
calibres of guns and so forth. We sat
for a public examination, and two weeks
before the due date he decided to take
a couple of extra subjects just to make
sure. He chose botany and physiology,
bought the textbooks and passed in
both. He was not only good at facts,
but at relations also, and was on the way
to becoming a mathematical genius with
whom Oliver Heaviside thought it was
worth corresponding, when he was killed
in the Singapore mutiny in the 1914-18
war.

“Lubber”:' Mention of Admiral Try on
(B. 11 /12/’46) recalls that the R.A.N.
owes much, possibly its very existence, to
this sailor who was to come to such an
unfortunate end. He was put in charge of
the Australian station in 1884, and three
years later as a result of his recommenda-
tions it was agreed that the colonies would
contribute to the support of an auxiliary
squadron to be attached to the British
ships already operating in the Pacific.
More important still, he urged—first in a
letter to Samuel Griffith —that more than
a mere subsidised force was required ;
what was needed was “the personal
service of our countrymen.” This thought
inspired in due course the R.A.N. Other
activities of Tryon were the equipping of
Garden Island and the planning of the
defences of the chief ports of the States.
One scheme of his had to wait 60 years
for adoption; he suggested a mutual
insurance plan to cover war losses caused
by enemy attacks on undefended towns.

“Col M.”: During the war years, many
Diggers did away with the formality v of
buying railway tickets. Being able
to walk briskly past the blokes on the
gate, with a preoccupied look on their
faces, became a fine art. A different
proposition were the officials who went
through the carriages, for the purpose of
stinging those without tickets. One foot-
slogger going home from the city fell
asleep while crossing Sydney Harbor
Bridge. He was awakened by a touch on
the shoulder from an inspector. He looked
out of the window, roughly oriented
“But, Daddy, I'd rather have a rag doll!”
his position, and declared that he’d got
on at Pymble, which he thought to have
been the train’s last stop. “Stiff luck
mate,” sympathised the snapper, “but
we’re just pulling out of Waverton.” As
any Sydneysider knows, that station is
several short of Pymble.

“Jasby”: Devotees of “contemporary
art” are apparently much the same the
whole world over —creatures with sensi-
tive souls, yet with bodies so insensible
to physical pain that their legs can be
stretched to 40 times the length of a
Dobell limb without their being aware of
it. Latest example comes from Los
Angeles, where a nightmare depicting a
fish with bloodshot eyes and purple bags
and portion of a magazine pin-up girl
was accepted as a work of art by an
Oriental genius. Perpetrator of the
masterpiece was Jim Moran, described
as a “professional funnyman,” who
claims he committed the atrocity with
the aid of some nail polish and chalk
m the space of a few hours in order to
demonstrate that “this long-haired art
racket is phoney.” The loud whirring
noise that has been puzzling Hollywood
ever since is the beating of the wings of
the American cousins of the Angry
Penguins trying to convince Moran that
he produced a real masterpiece despite
himself.

“Colbun”: The new robot “brain” de-
veloped by Britain’s National Physical
Laboratory has opened up mathematical
possibilities which extend certain aspects
of physics to extents and in directions as
yet unpredictable. Known as A.C.E.,
“Hang on a bit longer , cant you — I've nearly got it out!"
short for Automatic Computing Engine,
it has a “memory” capacity of 75,000
decimal digits the most advanced
American machine covers bnly 200 and
is slower and much more complicated to
work. A.C.E. is told what to do by
pushing suitably-punched cards into
slots. If the punching is wrong it rings
a bell and goes on strike. Amongst its
more elementary efforts is the multiplica-
tion of two ten-figure numbers—each in
the thousand-million range—and produc-
tion of an unavoidably correct answer
in two-thousandths of a second. Few live
mathematicians will tackle an equation
containing more than 12 unknowns in it.
A.C.E. grinds out the right answer up to
50 or more in a few minutes. It sounds
like a useful present for Mr. Chifley
should he ever want to estimate the
revenue obtainable if he could only dare
to tax “sport.”
“Traymon”: I always find it refreshing
to hear an old grievance approached from
a new angle. In my suburban train The
old-timer opposite, glancing rapidly
through his morning paper, gave vent to
an exclamation of delight. “I see they’re
goin’ to raise first prize in the lottery io
£6OOO at last,” he announced. “An’
about time, too. The way the cost of
livin’s been goin’ the wonder is they ain’t
woke up to themselves before.”

“Wogle”; On reading that they have
conjured up an automatic hand-washing
gadget for those with one mitt out of
commission, I thought back to a day a
few years ago. The group of recruits
were getting their first look at the army
through the medium of a medical parade.
One, when asked by the M.O. to wash
his hands in preparation for a blood-
test, queried “What, both of them?” The
doc. clenched his jaw. “No, lad. Only
one. I’d just love to see how you do it.”

“Jurumudi” : Bureaucrats (B. 4/12/ ’46)
belong to a class and the class compre-
hends all nations. I was in Rome after
the first war and, wanting to get
to Florence, had to get a visa before I
could move on. I joined a long queue at
the passports department and after an
hour’s wait gained access to a room at
which 40 uniformed officials sat at a long
table. My passport was in order, but I
needed a stamp. Where did I get one?
At the nearest tobacco-and-salt shop—
salt and tobacco were Government mono-
polies. I joined another queue, and after
40 minutes reached my objective, to be
told that the stamps had been sold out.
After a long trip to a distant part of the
city I joined another queue and eventually
got what I was after. Returning to the
department I took my place in a fourth
queue, and after spending another hour
which could have been spent surveying
the Coliseum I reached the gent, who had
previously interviewed me. He scanned my
passport, reached for his pen and then had
a whispered colloquy with his next-door
neighbor ; then I saw my document start-
ing on a journey down the line of officials.
I am normally a timid person, but some-
thing snapped inside me. I banged my
fist on the table, a heavy oak one, and
started shouting. It may have been that
the 40 civil servants thought I was a
cousin of Umberto or that I had the
might of the British Navy behind me, but
I was outside the building with my visa in
30 seconds, much more surprised than
the officials.

“G.M.”: Visions of a White Christmas
could well become an actuality to resi-
dents of Hobart this year. There has
been a continuous blanket of snow on
Mt. Wellington since May. Although it
has worn thin several times the caprices
of Tassie’s weather have come to the
rescue with another thick layer always
in time. Of small comfort to Hobartians,
the phenomenon has been a source of
interest and enjoyment to mainland
tourists, who, when they start to freeze,
can always skip back to warmer climates.

“Uramao”: A recent par. on missing
pages passing unnoticed by readers of a
novel reminded me of a history of my
small town completed in 1888. A typo-
graphical error that hit me in the face
had apparently gone .unnoticed by
most people who read the history. The
historian was relating an early episode of
the town ; a public official had skipped by
the light of the moon, leaving the war-
chest empty. The history relates that at
a meeting of the town board quite a series
of alligators descended on the head of the
secretary. No wonder he didn’t come
back!

“Passun”: Blauber, the Dutchman, was
a very funny man and enjoyed himself
even in a Japanese prison camp
until beriberi got him. He was a born
scrounger. To fill his shrinking belly he
had traded everything but his loincloth.
Then he was caught stealing from the
Jap kitchen. He kept his head, but re-
ceived a bashing and was ordered to do
the laundry of the warrior gods—but not
during work-party, hours. That night
Blauber was a millionaire. For 10
glorious minutes he had Utopia to him-
self. He stole what wouldn’t be easily
missed ; cigarettes, money, scraps of food,
old clothing ; planted his loot for easy re-
covery, and did the washing. He even
sprinkled formalin on Jap G strings—
or said he did.
* * * *
“Nippon 00”: There has been much
talk in recent years concerning the type
of mentality masked by the supposedly
inscrutable countenances of the Japanese.
Written 10 years ago, Bruce Lockhart’s
Return to Malaya has a remark worth
quoting; “I remember an opinion of the
Japanese expressed by one of the Dutch
traders 80 years ago—‘a very resolute
folk ; lambs in their own land, but almost
devils outside.’ ” Had the old Dutchman
lived to see the Nips swarming over the
Indies he would have had no reason to
revise his opinion.

“Rat-Bag”: Whenever a nice-looking
Saturday turns up I’m out there with
the rest of ’em, but on Monday morning
I am once again convinced that Sydney
Harbor fishermen are mad. Arriving on
the waters you select a likely spot, tie
the bottle over the back and begin the
serious task of fishing. Half an hour ;
then a bite. You drag in about an inch
and a half of Cockney bream. This
brings an uproar from over your
shoulder of “Strewth. He’s getting ’em! ”
You look around amazed and find your-
self surrounded by small craft that have
crept up on you unobserved. Disgusted,
you move on. Just around the point you
see a bloke pulling something in. It is
a six-inch flathead. Muttering “Strewth,
he’s getting them, too,” you find your-
self straining at the rowlocks, racing the
other craft that are preparing to hem
him in*.

“W.P.T.”: What is there about cedar
that makes it so expensive to buy at
auction sales? Recently at an auction I
saw a filthy, old-fashioned and uncom-
fortable upholstered cedar armchair sold
for £l4 10s. At the same sale a modern
maple chair in new condition was sold for
a couple of pounds. Cedar is certainly a
rare timber nowadays, but I doubt if this
should make it bring such a high price in
furniture articles.

“Blink”: If anyone inaugurates a fund
for the upkeep of proprietors of Sydney’s
classier hash-houses I’ll gladly contribute
the first threepence. Apparently the mem-
bers of this clan are on their last financial
legs, as J. C. Bendrodt, writing in the
Sydney “Daily Telegraph,” declares that
“owning Princes is not like possessing
Ali Baba’s treasure cave... .the relation
between net profits and gross turnovers
is somewhat less than the average com-
mercial business. You don’t believe me?
An even thousand —winnings to Legacy
—says it was true, even when the Yanks
were here. Who’ll bet?” My grandpa
runs an “average commercial business”
making dog-collars, and not even at
Christmas-time would he be able to collar
a thousand pounds to make a bet.
STRENUOUS HOLIDAYS.
“Over 300 Sydney University and Technical Col-
lege students are working as railway porters, cleaners
and ticket-collectors' during the Christmas vacation.”
Well and why not? In these enforced vacations
Along with steady wages one assumes
They’ll profitably broaden their relation^
With life, and learn a lot on railway stations
Untaught in lecture-rooms.
One visions them, when term begins, returning
To where pale students burn the midnight oil
And profs disseminate assorted learning,
With first-hand notions of their own concerning
The dignity of toil;
Of manual toil, that is, like humping cases
And pushing platform trucks at the behest
Of worried tourists bound for various places
And cockies homing for the open spaces
To north or south or west. %
They’ll get some insight into what less common
And possibly a bit more valuable
Than any l lore from mortar-boarded dominies,
To wit, the ways of ordinary homines
And femirue as well.
They’ll learn to be assiduous assailers
Of problems never to be found in books,
Watchful and indefatigable nailers
Of subtle tricks employed by would-be scalers
And other kinds of crooks.
For an epitome, a condensation
Of modern life with all its pros and cons,
Where would you find a happier illustration
Than that provided by a railway station?
And so—here’s luck, my sons!

Making sure
4)000 men operate our maintenance system —evolved during
22 years. Every part of each aircraft has a recorded history,
giving the signature of every man who ever adjusted, checked
or inspected it —and when, and why. No part, however
small or seemingly unimportant, can escape removal for test
or renewal at periods known and rigidly observed. Here is
an aircraft which, after overhaul, was checked in every detail,
re-checked by supervisors, certified airworthy—and towed
200 yards to the runway. Each tyre must now be checked again,
inch by inch: the whole tail frame must be re-examined.
Maintenance, in 8.0.A.C., means certainty.

THE SERVICE MAN
On Australia's Lifeline.
“Ek Dum”; The curious uniform pat-
tern of the undeclared world-war in-
creasingly obtrudes itself.
In the East Indies a powerful struggle
is in progress for control of the unions,
It is being directed from Australia by the
Central Committee of the Communist
party, and is being carried on in two big
groups by Communists, Harjon and Sur-
jon, both of whom spent their war years
in Australia at school with the Com-
munist party. Their organisations are
patterned on the Australian—a system
or union control by blackmail and the
promotion of industrial unrest.
As usual the Socialists are at a disad-
vantage. They spent their war years in
Indies under Japanese domination.
Ihe Communists have a cut-and-dried
plan made for them by Moscow and its
Australian agents. And their workers are
trained.
Menace to White Australia
An early move will almost certainly
be a demand for the admission of In-
donesians into Australia on a large scale ;
Communists hate the White Australia
policy. The fight is already on in U.N.0.,
where the question of the admission of
Asiatics and others to New Guinea has
been raised. On that issue, the Canberra
Government is likely to prove docile,
“Go on —DO tell us where you had your all-over perm doner!"
When the deportation of a large gang of
Indonesian Communists and agitators was
mooted the Government offered them the
choice of returning to their own country
or going to New Guinea.
Other operations beyond Australia con-
tinue to link with these happenings. They
are taking place all along the route
to Europe, The Communists are active
in India, where Mr. Nehru shows
the greatest tolerance of them, and in
Persia, where the Persians have found it
necessary to send troops to Azerbaijan to
ensure that the forthcoming elections are
not altogether dominated by Moscow’s
humble servants of the Tudeh party.
In Palestine the bulk of the prob-
lems connected with Jewish immigration
would vanish if the U.S.S.R. and its
satellites ceased to export their worst
types of terrorist Jews, who are being
deliberately sent abroad to harass
Britain, while the U.S.S.R. pretends to
continue as a British ally.
The Fight Round Greece
In Cyprus the Communists have sud-
denly organised a movement for union
with Greece, Cyprus was Turkish terri-
tory up to the beginning of World War
I —though under British administration
by agreement since 1878. In 1914 Britain
annexed it, and a year later offered it to
Greece if the Greeks would help Serbia.
The Communists are eager for the change
as part of their policy, which involves the
conquest of Greece and its conversion
into a Russian satellite Power, thus mili-
tarily surrounding Turkey, fuming the
Aigean into, a Russian lake and blotting
out British influence in the Middle East.
What the Communists hope they are
doing is to place Cyprus in a position to
become Russian soil and in the meantime
to deprive Britain of it as a military base,
which it is suggested that the island will
become in substitution for Egypt.
Tito’s Part ?
In Greece and the Adriatic the same
policy is in operation. The Albanian
atrocities against the ships of Great
Britain, which have become the subject
of a stem British Note to the guilty
ruffians, are part of the policy; so is the
war which is taking place along the
Grseco-Yugoslav border, on the main
road from Skoplje and Yugoslavia in
general to Salonika. Tito is a party
to these operations. At U.N.O. M.
Tsaldaris has protested, charging the
Yugoslavs with a plot to engulf Greek
Macedonia —which means also annexing
Greece’s natural defence lines.
It says little for the sense of humor
of the delegates to U.N.O. that they can
watch their Yugoslav colleagues joining
in the representations that Franco’s Spain
should be sterilised as a “danger to
peace.” If there is a plague breeding spot
for international war anywhere, it is
Yugoslavia, which is advance H.Q. for
European aggression against the lifelines
of the British Commonwealth, and which
sports internal conditions which would
have disgraced a Tartar nation of the
Middle Ages.
The former chief of the foreign press
section in Tito’s Information Depart-
ment, Bogdan Raditza —he escaped edrly
this year without bidding his employer
farewell—thus describes the dictator:
He can smile. He can act. He dresses
like Goring, gesticulates like Mussolini,
tries to talk like Stalin... .Tito will smile
lor five hours on a reviewing stand while
thousands of workers and Government em-
ployees and schoolboys file past him shout-
ing “Tito is ours! Ti-to! Ti-to! Ti-to!”
The refugee says that Tito’s “Govern-
ment” is entirely in the hands of Mos-
cow-trained Communists, directed by
Kardelj, a Yugoslav delegate to U.N.0.,
who is an actual Russian agent and under
whose thumb a “secret” police force of
100,000 and the Elite Guard, a body uni-
formed like Hitler’s Black Guard,
operates as the “best-fed, best-clothed and
best-armed military force of
with licence to arrest and execute with-
out trial.
“War Against Britain and U.S.”
He quotes Comrade Kardelj:
We have made certain concessions to
the capitalist world in order to gain time.
But when the hour strikes we must be
ready for the offensive. The proletarian
revolution is on the march. It is linked
to t the Soviet Union through agreements of
mutual political and economic assistance.
It is creating, so Stalin has said, a union
of all the many parts of the revolution into
one system. That system will go into a
frontal attack against the imperialistic
system.
Raditza also quotes an address of
Lieut.-Colonel Perovich, Communist poli-
tical commissar of the Fourth Division of
the Elite Guard, to his troops (Feb. 17);
Anglo-Americans are the heads of the in-
ternational hypocritical reaction, and they
are menacing world peace. We can rely
only on the Soviet Union. It alone has
democratic ideals. Up to now we have
been obliged to say “Together with Eng-
land and America for the preservation of
peace.” Now we are able to say “War

against England and the United States and
all the world’s imperialistic forces.”
The supreme conundrum in the world
today, as a well-known U.S. European
correspondent, S. M. Boulton, remarks in
a recent issue of the “American
Mercury,” is “why Anglo-Americans “re-
fuse to believe what. Josef Stalin has
written for all to read” of his ultimate
purposes, on the achievement of which
his agents throughout the world are
already embarked, particularly along the
belt of countries which hold European
trade routes to Australia and the Far
East, in which the war is already on.
Another Bose Repudiation.
“Ek Dum”: The Canberra insti-
tution which calls itself a Govern-
ment has been reported by one of its
trusted organs, the Sydney “D.T.,” to be
considering the establishment of a
permanent army of one (1) regular divi-
sion and two (2) militia divisions—about
90,000 officers and men —having rejected
a suggestion from the Army that the
force should be one regular division and
three militia divisions. As things are, if
called upon to defend the continent, it
could scarcely put a fighting brigade into
the field. On February 1 next the Seventh
Military District (Northern Territory)
garrison will be down to 200 men.
Replying to Mr. Archie Cameron, the
Army Minister said that the matter had
not yet been considered. The facts are
that by the end of January the forces will
be down below 50,000, and while almost
every other country in the world has its
new defence schemes in working order
—Britain, U.S., China, France and Russia
are all sticking to compulsory service—
the Australian “Government” is loafing
along in its normal way, its policies dic-
tated to it by the Communist party via
the “defence” unions.
Battle Order in 1942
The crowd at Canberra has a bad
memory, and in these matters it finds a
bad memory convenient. Immediately
after General MacArthur came here —
and when he arrived the “Government,”
according to Mr, Ward, had rectified
“Tory” neglect and established a firm
defence of the north—the battle order of
Australia was somewhat as follows:
At Darwin there was two-thirds of a
badly-equipped division, with six six-
inch guns and 22 heavy ack-ack
guns; and there were two squadrons
of Hudsons under strength, a squadron
of Wirraways in hopeless condition and
two squadrons of U.S. A24s. The
Government’s military advisers urged the
need for a division with' about 150 ack-
ack guns, three modern fighter squadrons,
one general recce squadron, two dive-
bomber squadrons, a heavy bomber
squadron, one army co-operation
squadron, one flying-boat recce squadron
and one transport sqpadron. This was
long after the bombing at Darwin.
At Moresby there was a brigade group
with two six-inch coastal guns of doubtful
vintage and efficiency, 10 ack-ack guns,
six Catalinas, seven Hudsons and a
squadron of Wirraways. By the “Govern-
ment’s” own estimates there were required
three aircraft-carriers, six eight-inch-gun
cruisers, four six-inch-gun cruisers and
12 destroyers to cover the eastern
coast as well as the Moresby approaches ;
together with a brigade group and strong
and heavy ack-ack defences, four
squadrons of fighters, two flying-boat
squadrons, two dive-bomber squadrons, a
torpedo-bomber squadron, two heavy-
bomber squadrons and two transport
squadrons to cover the coast from Towns-
ville northwards to Moresby. The “Gov-
ernment” did not need to take defence
of the New Guinea mandate into account
that had been thrown away.
In Westralia there were Admiral Glass-
furd’s squadron of onb six-inch cruiser,
destroyers and submarines and a few odd
ships, based on Fremantle, a battered
squadron of Hudsons, a dozen Wirraways
and the only American Kittyhawk
squadron then in the country. The
military force consisted of a brigade
group and four “garrison battalions” of
old volunteers hastily got together. Many
of these, as in other States, were internee
guards.
“Labor” defence, of the country north
of the so-called “Brisbane line” therefore
consisted of four (4) brigades, very ill-
equipped, one of them cut off in Moresby ;
another in the Perth region and a couple
at Darwin.
Below “The Brisbane Line”
On the east coast of Australia, south
of Townsville, “Labor” had the “equiva-
lent” of nine divisions and 25 garrison
battalions, all but one division and two
battalions south of the so-called “Brisbane
Line ” Most of the “divisions”
were mere herds, some of which had not
even had the training which the
Minister, Mr. Forde, prescribed as neces-
sary for the battle-line—three weeks with-
out drill, a formality which Mr. Forde’s
advisers of the “D.T.” and the Communist
party told him was unnecessary, so Tong
as his troops were imbued with hatred,
armed with Molotov cocktails and deft
in the use of the fire-stick for scorched-
earth purposes. Thousands of this force
were not armed with even a pop-gun or a
dozen rounds, and they had no air sup-
port.
The 25 garrison battalions included
hundreds of men who had not even a
pocketknife, others being equipped with
cadet rifles. Some of them were not
fitted out to cook for themselves much
less fight, though, all being old soldiers,
any platoon of them had had more train-
ing than most of the rest of the “Army”
put together.
The air defence of the %hole of
Eastern Australia south of Townsville
consisted of a battered training squadron *
of Hudsons not at full strength, another
operational one, far from fully-equipped,
three or four squadrons of Wirraways,
the best part of a squadron of Beaufort
bombers (the crews not yet trained), and
perhaps half-a-dozen creaking naval air-
craft.
The Government’s advisers’ view of re-
quirements was 11 fighter squadrons, five
dive-bomber squadrons, three general
recce squadrons, two heavy-bomber
squadrons, two flying-boat squadrons and
some transport and fleet co-operation
squadrons—about 42 squadrons in all;
say, 500 machines, from the largest four-
engined bombers to modern fighters fit to
tussle it out with a Zero, apart from re-
serves. There wasn’t a fighter or a really
operable light-bomber in the whole place,
much less the heavy stuff, or any tor-
pedo-bombers to go out and meet the
naval attacker.
“Twenty-five Divisions”
There were at that time not more than
four Jap divisions available within a
thousand miles of the Australian coast to
attack from Perth to Townsville.
Yet the “Government” believed that it
needed at least 25 divisions and upwards
of 75 R.A.A.F. squadrons of all types.
With 11 divisions (so called) and 15
(alleged) air squadrons at its disposal its
knees were knocking so loudly together
that the noise must have got between the
sleep of both President Roosevelt and Mr.
Churchill.
“Labor” voices were heard almost every
hour proclaiming that the previous Gov-
ernment should be impeached for having
so left Australia undefended —“crimin-
ally prosecuted,” in Mr. Ward’s words.
Yet at the first opportunity the same
sorry crowd has killed the R.A.A.F.,
shows every sign of killing the R.A.N. and
is allowing the strength of the forces
available in Australia to fall to the
strength of about two non-operable divi-
sions, though for practical purposes it
will be impossible to put a single division
in the field without months of prepara-
tion. And if war came that division
would have to do what the Chifleys be-
lieved would need a minimum of 25
divisions when distantly threatened by
a small Jap force. The “Government”
chooses to forget its solemn assurances of
1942-1944 that the condition of affairs at
the outbreak of the Japanese war “must
never happen again.” Its repudiation of
expressed principles is as base as anything
in Australian political history.

PERSONAL ITEMS
War-time co-operation between British
and American naval forces was recalled
in Melbourne last week when the Ameri-
can Ambassador, Robert Butler, invested
Admiral of the Fleet Lord Tovey with
the Legion of Merit. Lord Tovey was
C.-in-C. at the Nore at the time of the
invasion of Europe, and large U.S. naval
forces taking part in the invasion were
based, loaded and staged under his com-
mand. The award is “in recognition of
exceptionally meritorious conduct in the
performance of outstanding services to
the Government of the United States”
at that time.
Maorilanders have a way of muscling
into the seats of learning abroad. Ronald
Syme, a Taranaki man, is one of the most
able exponents of Roman history in
Britain, if not in the world. He was on
the staff of the British Embassy at Bel-
grade and Ankara. While in Turkey he
took the professorship of Latin at the
University at Istanbul. Now back at his
old Fellowship at Trinity College, Oxford,
Syme is devoting his studies? to archae-
ology. A Dunedin man, Dr. Harold
Taylor is primarily responsible for the
administration, of Cambridge University
finances. He was appointed treasurer to
the Uni. last year. As a lieut.-colonel in
the Cambridge O.T.C. Taylor was head
of the principal gunnery school of the
British Army. That ancient institution the
Clarendon Press at Oxford is virtually
under the management of Kenneth Sisam,
a Rhodes Scholar, from Auckland. He
is secretary to the delegates of the press.
Percy Leason has been living in
America for eight years, concentrating
on illustration work for “Collier’s” and
other magazines, but he is still as Aus-
tralian at heart as he was when he was
doing cartoons and joke-blocks for The
Bulletin. Recently at the Newton gal-
leries in New York he gave an exhibition
of visual portrait painting, and in a subse-
quent address threatened to come back
to this country to start a resistance move-
ment against so-called modern art.
Leason maintained that the only artists
who could really call themselves modern
were those who had spent years study-
ing the accumulated knowledge of the
centuries, and that those who ignored or
discarded the treasures of the past were
merely pagans in art.
Norman Grantham Hosking, who be-
comes S.A. Rhodes Scholar for 1947, is
a product of Saint’s, and won the gold
medal of the School of Mines Graduates’
Association for the most outstanding B.Sc.
(Engineering) course at Adelaide Uni.
before he was 20. Now a 8.E., on the
threshold of 22, he’s specialising in soil
mechanics in relatioh to structures and
their foundations, having been in charge
of testing operations at the Cockatoo
Docks, Sydney, and at Birkenhead (S.A.).
At sport Hosking made the college tennis
team and this year won the McMichael
Cup at St. Mark’s and also played inter-
Varsity football against Melbourne.
Scores of Victorian and South Aus-
tralian schoolboys got their first taste of
deepwater sailing in the three Utiekahs,
owned by Elliot Giles, who has re-
tired from the teaching staff of Mel-
bourne Grammar. The first of the
dynasty was a modest 30-footer in which
Giles probed the estuaries of the Port
Adelaide River when he was a junior
teacher at the old Pulteney-street school.
At Oxford when World War One broke
out, he served in France as a gunner in
the British Army. Since then he has
taught at Melbourne Grammar in the
intervals between sailing Utiekah II and
Utiekah 111 on long ocean cruises. His t
longest cruise was a 10,000-mile jaunt’
around the South Sea islands in 1927
which was packed with the sort of ad-
venture this inveterate yachtsman delights
in. During the war Utiekah 111 was a
naval patrol vessel. For the umpteenth
time she will sail across Bass Strait fob
a convenient mooring-place near Hobart
where she will serve her owner as a
houseboat in his retirement.
With West-End trimfphs thick and re-
markably fresh upon him. Tommy
Trinder went on tour with E.N.S.A.,
visiting Syria, Palestine, Egypt, Italy,
Java, Sumatra, Burma, China and
Japan. After a season in Melbourne
he is now at Sydney Tiv., in “You
Lucky People,” and, on his first
night, practically took the place by storm
—a somewhat surprising phenomenon,
since English humor and our own brand
are often poles apart. But Trinder, as
well as a lightning-like nimbleness of
mind which enables him to ad lib. ad
infinitum, and which would have made
him a terror to interjectors had he chosen
a political career, showed he has some-
thing else, a personality, a “presence,”
which gives him a grip over his audi-
ence from the start. This was demon-
strated, after the show proper was ended,
when Trinder made a dignified and mov-
ing appeal for Food for Britain —and not
a soul moved for the doors. Trinder,
apparently, has gone to some pains to
make himself conversant with Australian
idiom, and this helped him. He was
assisted, too, by a kind of bubbling and
spontaneous gaiety; in the Carmen Mir-
anda impersonation there was more sheer
fun, than humor—Trinder seemed to be
enjoying himself so much that everyone
did the same, very heartily.
David Armstrong, at 20 the youngest
player to win the City of Sydney
Chess Championship, saw war service in
the Navy, his father being a lieut.-com-
mander. Concentration on a university
career may interfere with his chess de-
votion for a few years, but he is certain
to have a crack at State championship
honors first. A tall, well-built and like-
able lad, he has made Modern Chess
his Bible.
Of pianist Valma Lewis, who has won
the South Province Scholarship of the
Royal College of Music, London, Pro-
fessor Heinze said she has “the true touch
of genius.” There is evidently a touch
of Melba in her. When the diva turned
up at a rehearsal on one occasion with
a crushed hand, the result of the care-
less slamming of the door of her taxi,
she took her part rather than let down
the other performers. This 19-year-bld
musician recently played at a concert in
Geelong after a truck had collided with
the car in which she and other musicians
were travelling. Four days later it was
found that she had concussion of the
brain.
Before he could depict the lineaments
of Dr. Thomas J. Kiernan, Minister
Plenipotentiary for Eire in Australia, Mc-
Beath had to get past Mrs. Kiernan, a little
bit of Spanish, a little bit of French and
mostly Irish. In the end he spent two
hours with the couple. Mrs. Kiernan is
a very musical lady, has recorded folk-
songs of all nationalities, but especially
Irish, for H.M.V. in London, and has
already sung some of them publicly in
Melbourne. Dr. Kiernan has high
scholastic attainments. He is an M.A.

of the National University of Ireland, a
Doctor of Philosophy of London, a Fel-
low of the Royal Statistical Society and
a member of the Council of the Irish
Texts Society. As an economist he has
published* authoritative books on British
war finance and the financial administra-
tion of his own land. Fie has come
from the position of Minister to
the Vatican, and before that was secre-
tary to the High Commissioner in
London and director of Radio Eireann.
The purpose of his four years’ visit is to
improve cultural relations between Aus-
tralia and De Valera’s domain. Apart
from all this they are both very charm-
ing people, extremely broadminded in
their outlook on life and with wide in-
terests in politics, music and what
have you. In a recent broadcast talk the
High Commissioner revealed a welcome
sense of humor. “In conclusion,” said
Dr. Kieman, “if there is anyone still
listening, I bid him goodnight.”
“Uramao”: Under the will of Philip
Augustus Edmiston, who died in Syd-
ney last September at 93, Auckland
is a beneficiary to the tune of some hun-
dred thousand pounds after the Maori-
land Government takes its cut and annui-
ties and life interests are provided for.
The purpose of the bequest is to estab-
lish and maintain an art gallery in the
“last, loneliest, loveliest, exquisite, apart”
city where Edmiston was an insurance
man until his retirement 40 years ago.
“L.H.P.”: Eugene Goossens’s appoint-
ment should give a great impetus to opera
productions at Sydney Conservatorium.
He conducted “Esmeralda,” founded on
Hugo’s Hunchback of Notre Dame, and
“Jennie Deans,” based, on Scott’s Heart
of Midlothian, in the English provinces
for the Carl Rosa Opera Co. “Jeanie
Deans” was composed by Hamish Mac-
Cunn, a brother to Andrew, who con-
ducts for J.C.W., and it provides excellent
entertainment, as does “Esmeralda,” the
product of Goring Thomas. It is to be
hoped Goossens will see his way clear
to introduce these charming works to
opera-starved Australians.
Professor R. R. Blackwood, Mel-
bourne University’s first professor of
mechanical engineering, ought to feel at
home there. He graduated from the insti-
tution as Bachelor of Electrical Engineer-
ing and Bachelor of Civil Engineering,
and later won two research scholarships
which enabled him to graduate as Master
of Civil Engineering. His sister, Margaret
Blackwood, will next year be sub-dean
of women and lecturer in medical botany
at the Mildura branch of the University,
and his younger brother is demonstrator
in chemistry in Melbourne. His father
was a sub-warden of Trinity College.
The new professor comes from the job
of technical manager to Dunlop Rubber.
During the war he advised the Army on
tyre-performance questions and twice
visited the U.S. on special missions.
C. Scott Fletcher, appointed president
of Encyclopaedia Britannica Films Inc.
(U.S.A.), will take a leading part in the
American movement for expanding adult
education. Son of Professor M. Scott
Fletcher, of Brisbane, he went from the
C.E.G.S. there to Sydney University and
an economics degree, and thence into the
Studebaker car concern, in which, called
to the U.S.A. in 1929, he has risen high.
With his Sydney-born wife and their three
children he will live near Chicago, where
the new educational organisation has its
headquarters.
With the death of Henry Gillies at 46,
Queensland’s public service has lost a
very capable man. Entering the State
service in 1917 at Innisfail, he was trans-
ferred to Brisbane in 1923 and five years
later qualified as a barrister. Appointed
as Supreme Court Registrar in 1932, he
also held the offices of registrar of com-
panies, district registrar of the High
Court, and deputy industrial registrar of
the Commonwealth Arbitration Court. In
addition, he acted as chairman on several
boards of inquiry during the war years,
and recently, at the request of the Federal
Arbitration Court, mediated in the water-
side dispute at Townsville. In a vale-
dictory notice Chief Justice Macrossan
described him ,as a zealous, industrious,
and conscientious officer, and expressed
the opinion that his death was accelerated
by his devotion to duty.
Once more a provincial art prize has
gone to a Melbourne artist, William
Dargie, the 1946 Archibald Prize winper,
having awarded the Bendigo Art Gallery’s
£lOO prize to Harley Griffiths for an oil,
“The Studio.” The winner is a son of
Harley Griffiths, one of the earliest pupils
of Max Meldrum. Len Annois, another
Melbourne artist, came first in the water-
color section.
When some R.A.A.F. business took
Squadron-Leader Archibald Donald Mc-
Fadyen, pictured here by Prior, to the
outback of Western Queensland, he was
questioned by a very ancient stockman
as to the progress of the war. “We’re
doing all right,” the McFadyep said.
“We’re jumping from island to island
and pinning the Nip down as we go.”
“No doubt about that chap MacArthur,”
ASST. PROVOST MARSHAL.
said the ancient, “he’s doing exactly what
I said we shoulda done all along —
boundary-ride the little yellow blankards,
boundary-ride ’em.” Boundary-riding of
another kind has been the McFadyen’s
job since he enlisted in the R.A.A.F. in
1941 —as Assistant Provost Marshal in
North Queensland, New Guinea, the
Northern Territory and at present in N.
S. Wales with headquarters at Bradfield
Park, he has been policing the legal
fences of the Air Force for five years.
He still has plenty to do—the odd offender
still turns up in the R.A.A.F. and, since
the service police have taken over security,
there are millions of pounds’ worth of
equipment to be guarded and accounted
for. A grazing man before the war, with
a strong interest in politics—he was presi-
dent of the Victorian Liberal-Country
group from 1939 until he enlisted —Mc-
Fadyen hopes to return to the land when
the R.A.A.F. gives him his bowler hat.
Sydney Gordon Stanley Herron, new
secretary of the A.N.A. in Victoria, won
its individual debating championship in
1933. Elected to the Victorian board of
directors in that year, he was chief presi-
dent in 1938. Golf and an occasional
visit to the races ar,e his recreations. Born
at St. Kilda, he is 60.
Into the silence;
At Te Awamutu, M.L., at 59, A. I. Mc-
Govern, breeder and racer of prads, among
them High Caste. A son, Dr. Vincent Mc-
Govern, is a medical research worker in
Sydney.
At Nambour (Q.), at 57, Albert William
Kittle, secretary of the Maroochy River Associ-
ation, the Moreton Mill Suppliers’ Committee
and the South-Eastern District Executive of
Canegrowers. An Old Digger, he always had a
helping hand for returned men.
At Christchurch, M.L., at 72, Professor R. E.
Alexander, formerly director of Canterbury
Agricultural College. Educated at the Royal
Academical Institution at Belfast, and the Royal
College of Science, Dublin, he was for a couple
of years instructor in agriculture for Co.
Londonderry. He arrived in M.L. in 1909,
and retired ten years ago.
In Brisbane, at 78, Eneas Fraser Gilchrist,
8.A., M.C.E., City Engineer from 1917 to
1937. Educated at Scotch College and Melbourne
Uni., he had held several important posts in
Victoria before coming to Queensland, and was
regarded as one op Australia’s leading authorities
on city engineering problems.
In Sydney, at 50, Dr. J. A. Gruen, formerly
of Cumnock (N.S.W.). At one time a resident
M.O. at St. Vincent’s Hospital, he played
Rugby for Sydney Uni., and was a captain in
World War I.

Women's Letters
From Melbourne
It was a very gay and happy at-home
that was held by the Victoria League
Club, with Admiral of the Fleet Lord
Tovey and his wife as guests of honor.
The distinguished visitors, who were
accompanied by the Hon. Mrs. Ronald
Douglas, were received by the chairman
of the club, Miss Mary Chomley, and
vice-presidents Mrs. Guy Bakewell,
wearing a cool pink ensemble with wide
matching straw hat, and Mrs. Rupert
Greene, who chose black. Lady Tovey
was presented with a bouquet of pink
roses and was later taken on a tour of
inspection of the club. ' She saw some
of the work done by the Victoria League
and met a number of overseas brides,
who meet at the club once a week.
Among the guests were the Governor’s
sister, Mrs. J. Haselden ; Miss Penelope
Nettlefold, who wore a tailored frock
of dove-grey linen and large white hat;
Mrs. A. A. Lord, happy in the thought
of a holiday to Tasmania; Mrs. Cairns
Officer, Mrs. Robert Hamilton, Mrs.
John Shaw (her smart navy-blue suit was
worn with a chic little white hat), and
Mrs. R. A. Staughton.
The executive committee of Navy
House has sent out its final report. Navy
House opened in October, 1940, and
until it closed its doors in July, 1946,
the number of meals served to ratings
was over 650,000, with over 200,000 beds
provided. More than £lOO,OOO was col-
lected during 'the years of the House’s
existence. To the trustees of the R.A.N.
Relief Fund Commodore J. Armstrong,
as chairman, handed a cheque for
£15,888 10s. Bd., being the very hand-
some balance in hand. First hon. sec.
to the R.A.N. Naval Patriotic Committee
was Reg Collins, brother of the commo-
dore. First president of auxiliaries was
the Colvin lady.
Valerie Palmer, elder daughter of Mrs.
Palmer, of Dalvui, Terang, and of the
late Mr. Claude Palmer, was married last
Saturday to Wing-Commander Maurice
William Callow, R.A.F., at All Saints,
Terang. The bride’s sister, Mrs. A. R.
Creswick, and members of the Church
Guild massed groupings of blue and
white flowers in the chancel and the ser-
vice was fully choral. The bride chose
a pastel-blue crepe gown, with the centre
panel and long sleeves beaded in matching
tones. Her short blue tulle veil was
held in place by delphiniums, forget-me-
nots, love-in-the-mist and sprigs of blue
hydrangeas. Her shower bouquet was
formed of the same flowers. Given away
by her brother Neville, the bride had one
attendant, Mary Guy Smith, whose
Edwardian gown was of pastel-blue
marquisette, featuring a bustle and long
full bishop sleeves. The bridegroom, who
is the second son of Mrs. Callow, of
London, and the late Mr. Charles Callow,
had Colonel Bertram Wright as best man.
Reception was held at the bride’s home,
to which many well-known western-
district friends came.
“Anna Christie,” that rather grim and
sordid play, was given a lively interpre-
tation by the Tin Alley Players, with
Edgar Harcourt as producer. The versatile
Keith Macartney as Chris Christopherson
and Dorothea Dixon as his daughter were
outstanding. The Union Theatre was
packed with an appreciative audience,
among them the Chancellor of the Uni-
versity, Mr. Justice Lowe, and Mrs.
Lowe, Vice-Chancellor J. D. G. Medley
and his wife and daughter Diana, Pro-
fessor Maurice Belz and his wife,
Mrs. H. G. Connell, Irene Mitchell,
Loveday Hills, Margaret Reid and
Dorothy O’Keefe, the last-named quartet
of the Little Theatre Group.
The engagement has been announced
of Prudence Marjorie, third daughter of
Mr. and Mrs. Douglas Boyd, of Chats-
worth Park, Tabilk, to Kenneth Baillieu
Myer, elder son of Mrs. Sidney Myer, of
Toorak, and the late Mr. Sidney Myer.
Kenneth served in the R.A.N. during the
war. Prudence, who has been doing Law
at the University, is now awaiting final
examination results. Date of the wedding
has not been set.
“A Life on the Ocean Wave” was cer-
tainly not the theme song chosen by the
captain and crew of the Toorak Junior
Auxiliary of the Women’s Hospital when
they held their dance aboard the s.s.
Sorrento. Owing to boiler trouble the
boat was unable to take its gay cargo on
the short trip down the bay. Instead it
remained at the pier, where it rocked in
the cold wind. Ticket-secretary Maureen
Wilton, in a green-pattemed white linen
evening frock, and her sister Anne, in a
fitting gown of olive-green suede crepe,
were escorted by their brother Lieut. lan,
on leave from Japan. More than 300
guests were received by the “captain,”
Mrs. N. Thomas, whose cotton evening
sown was patterned with colorful sailing
ships. Helping her achieve her aim of
raising £lOO to buy a special instrument
for the Women’s Hospital were the secre-
tary, Miss M. O’Connor, who covered
her Chartreuse gown with a white fur
wrap, and Miss E. Kiddle, who topped
her black taffeta skirt with a long jacket
of Chinese red and gold. Keeping a
weather eye on the party was Mrs. E. C.
Cornfoot, vice-president of Women’s
Hospital Auxiliaries.
The tall, good-looking blonde pictured
here by Broothorn is Tara Barry. Born
in Ireland, Tara began singing lessons
when very young. Later she was trained
for an operatic career by Madame Elena
Gbrhardt, famous Continental singer and
teacher. Forsaking the concert platform
on her marriage, Tara returned to her
profession on the death of her husband,
who was killed on active service. Richard
Tauber, visiting Dublin, heard Tara sing
Mimi in “La Boheme” and straightway
engaged her for the London production
of “Gay Rosalinda,” in which she played
the name part. She was appearing in
this production up to a month or so
before coming to Australia. During the
war Tara worked in a hospital in the
South of England and also toured with
tenor Heddle Nash and Australian
pianist Valda Aveling under the direc-
tion of E.N.S.A. Tara has scored a
great success in “Gay Rosalinda.” Her
three-year-old son is with his grand-
mother in England.
Members of the Engaged and Married
Girls Club gave a cheery afternoon-tea
party at the Y.W.C.A. for the overseas
brides and their children. They wisely
arranged each corner of the room into
groups of girls from their own country so
that they would feel more at home. The
four countries represented were England,
Canada, America and Switzerland. Mrs.
Tasker, who on arriving from England
18 months ago formed the Overseas
Brides Club, made and decorated the
Christmas cakes.
From Sydney
After the commercialised and tinselly
and varicolored expressions of the
Christmas spirit that have taken posses-
sion of the city ways, it was a gracious
experience to be led by Bach into that
country where shepherds watched their
sheep on a night above which a great
star burned true and bright. Sydney
listeners can thank the newly-formed Bach
Choral Society and conductor Henri
Krips for the really lovely singing and
orchestration in the “Cliristmas- Oratorio.”
The true message of Christmas flowed
out to a vast Town Hall audience, and to
innumerable thousands of radio listeners.
Mollie Grouse, Rosina Raisbeck,
Frederick Foxley and Noel Melvin were
the soloists. Werner Baer was the organ-
ist, and Daniel Koletz the pianist of the
night.
At the invitation of the Governor and
Mrs. Northcott about 22 presswomen
found their way to Government House
on Tuesday. This was in the nature of a
farewell party before the Governor and
his family move to Sutton Forest for
the summer months. The long drawing-
room was decorated with hydrangea,
agapanthus and Canterbury-bells. The
Governor’s daughter, Elizabeth North-
cott, welcomed the guests, assisted by
Mrs. M. E. Black and private-secretary
Sheila Collett. Elizabeth was a slight,
attractive figure in black. Mrs. Black
wore pink linens and Sheila Collett’s frock
was of powder-blue crepe. His Excel-
lency and Mrs. Northcott came in after
the tea-drinking to add their welcome to
the guests. The party was a happy and
informal affair, and good wishes for
Christmaa echoed on every side.
The women’s section of the Australian-
American Co-operation Movement held
its Christinas party at the Savarin. The
newly-elected president of the movement,
W. R, Hausliab, and his wife were the
guests of honor and were presented to
members by the president of the women’s
section, Mrs. Florence Taylor, who was
graceful in an all-black ensemble. The
hon. sec., Mrs. Ted Scorfield, also wore
black, and her hat of black balibuntal
was wide of brim and had one pink rose
tucked into its black ribbon band. Mrs.
Hausliab looked cool and attractive in
pale-blue linens, on which was pinned a
spray of white gardenias. Other notable
guests were Lady Wavertree ; the William
Martin couple, just returned after spend-
ing six years in U.S.A. and Marion Dun-
can, an American who is now working
with the Australian Red Cross. The pink-
iced Christmas cake was made by Mrs.
Scorfield; this, with a seven-branched
candlestick, Christmas-bells and Christ-
mas-bush and tiny red tubs holding
miniature pine-trees, gave color to the
buffet that stretched the length of the
room.
Mrs. Taylor made a happy little speech
of welcome, and Mr, Hausliab made apt
reply, then briefly talked of the necessity
of co-operation between Australia and
America. Mr. William Martin gave a
resume of the Christmas celebrations
throughout the ages. In his speech the
listeners saw the Christmas-tree grow
from the simplest sapling brought in from
the forest, and decorated with plain and
often crudely-made toys, to the elaborate
sophistication of some of the Hollywood
decorations. But he stressed that, no
matter how simple, or how fantastic
the tree, above it shone always the star
guiding to “Peace on Earth, Goodwill to
Men.”
Christmas attraction at the Conserva-
torium will be a three-night season by
the Sydney Musical Society. A spark-
ling cast will present “The Mikado” on
December 19, 20 and 21. Molly Grouse,
of the high and floating notes, will play
lead. Mary Sullivan and Molly Bunker,
established favorites with S.M.S. audi-
ences, will appear once more with the
society. Many of the singers are popular
concert and radio artists. Joe Joseph is
president and producer of the enterpris-
ing little company. The Sydney In-
dustrial Blind Institution benefits by the
season.
Newly-arrived from ravaged Holland
are Dutch violinist Willem Noske and
his wife. When next we complain of
shortages here —the difficulty of obtain-
ing a tailored suit or silk stockings—we
might, with advantage to our souls if not
to our appearance, go pianissimo on the
persistent chorus for pre-war standards
in food and clothes. When Mrs. Noske
arrived in Australia she was wearing an
army-type khaki shirt and skirt. The
shortage of clothing in Europe did not
allow her to secure anything suitable for
tropical wear, so the Government sup-
plied her and her husband with uniforms.
Mr. and Mrs. Noske met while out
searching for food during the dark war
days in Holland. Two months after the
liberation they were married. At that
time the food situation was getting
worse. Their daily ration was one
potato and one thin slice of bread a day.
But those nightmare days are now be-
hind them. Mr. Noske is in Australia
for recitals under A.B.C. direction.
He gives his first concert in Sydney with
the Sydney Symphony Orchestra to-
morrow night. Photograph of Mrs.
Noske by John Lefe.
Maorilander Nola Luxford, who was
founder-president of the Anzac Club in
New York, is swift on the wing. Recently
She flew up to New Guinea, where she
was the guest of the R.A.A.F. She visited
the various scenes of battle and the three
Australian cemeteries in Port Moresby
and Rabaul. She went over part of the
Kokoda Trail, and she plans when she
returns to U.S.A. to broadcast and write
a great deal about Australia’s war effort.
While she was in Sydney everybody en-
tertained this capable and unselfish
worker for the Anzacs. She was the guest
of the Federal Government at Canberra,
and of the State Governments at
Brisbane, Melbourne' and Sydney. The
R.S.L. and the R.A.A.F. gave two of the
receptions in her honor. Nola returns to
the U.S.A. after a visit to Maoriland as
the guest of its Government. She’s got a
niche for herself in the latest Who’s Who
in America.
Christmas carols are growing in favor
more and more —they have caught anew
the imagination of the people and are
being sung at almost every Christmas
party. They were sung by members of
the women’s committee of the Royal
Empire Society at their monthly party,
which was held in the society’s rooms —-
and workers on their way home paused,
their thoughts flying back to that first
Christmas, as the words of “Come All
Ye Faithful” and “Silent Night” floated
down through the windows into Bligh-
street.
Mrs. Keith Morris was the afternoon’s
hostess. Her attractive frock was of
greeny-purple-pattemed silk; her small
hat in orchid tonings. Huge bowls of
roses, gladioli, gerberas and hydrangea
were about the room—there was a Christ-
mas cake made by one of the members.
This was much commended when tea-
time came round. Mrs. George Parker,
Mrs, Eva Wunderlich and Miss Elizabeth
Plummer were among the 80 or so guests.
The afternoon’s soloist was soprano Elsie
Findlay; the pianist Gladys Hall.
Burghley Art lends itself to highly-
decorative effects. This is seen from the
pieces now being shown at Anthony
Hordern’s Fine Art Gallery. All the
work is in relief and the composition on
which the design is drawn and painted is
a trade secret. The Gallery on the open-
ing day was gay with wall decorations,
flowerpieces, animals and birds. A piece
in particulai that caused admiring com-
ment was a bowl of purple iris. One fire-
screen had for its motif three elephants
gravely pacing; another, bamboo shoots
on a silvery-green background. The ex-
hibitors are artist Mrs. Joan Duley and
singer Desmond Worthington, It was
Mrs. Duley’s mother, Mrs. Mae Henman,
who invented the process and taught it
to her daughter and Mr. Worthington on
her just-completed visit to Sydney. Minis-
ter for Tourist Activities Clive Evatt
opened the show and spoke of the develop-
ment of the arts in Australia. Mrs. Dud-
ley was attractive in flowered chiffons and
a wide-brimmed hat in orchid tonings.
Last week’s English mail brought a
letter from Mary Jay, settled into her
old home after a journey which took
11 weeks from Sydney to Liverpool. She
tells of going to her bank —the N. S.
Wales —a morning or so after her arrival
and finding to her delight that all the staff
get parcels each month from Australia.
They are terribly pleased and grateful,
and in answer to a leading question ad-
mitted that they hoped some dried fruits
would soon be included. She thinks the
people in the streets look thin and tired
to death but determined. Bognor, Tavi-
stock, Kent and Eire are spots on the
writer’s visiting list.
Black for elegance, says Paris. In all
the latest shows it is a fashion favorite
for formal wear. All white, too, is
another leader for dining and dancing.
For day-time browns are worn by
brunette and ♦ blonde. Nut-brown,
tobacco and chocolate and a beigey
brown are met at every turning.
Chartreuse, Nile greens and lime are
shades that trail and twirl after the sun
has sunk beyond the west. Warm berry-
reds and yellows in fine wool jersey
weaves appeal in jumper shapes, made
rather long to be worn outside the
skirt. Woollen crepes are now so fine
that they can be made into delicate
blouses outlined with drawn thread work.
With hopes high, 50,000 devotees made
for the Cricket Ground and the Second
Test last Saturday morning; but they
counted without the weather. All the
elements worked themselves into a fury
and by half-past one a drenching rain
was falling. However, the fire of en-
thusiasm wouldn’t be quenched and many
thousands remained during the wet and
dreary afternoon waiting for play to be
resumed. Sydney women are keen cricket
fans and they trekked out early, dressed
for the hot arid sultry weather in cool
linens and florals.
Among the cricket notables were Mrs.
Arthur Gilligan, the Stan McCabe couple,
Mrs. Sydney Smith (whose husband is
president of the N.S.W. Association) and
daughter Mrs. N. Hoddinott.

f Deducting outside interests in profits and reserves.
! On enlarged capital. § 14 months.
This big holding co. is one of Aus-
tralia’s major industrial organisations, and
its scrip is among the leaders in the mar-
ket. To get the undertaking into per-
spective it needs to be remembered that in
1939 the nameplate was changed from
Australian Glass Manufacturers to the
present title. At the same time the busi-
ness was split into a number of sub-
sidiaries, the scope of activities was
widened, and £2,558,814 of bonus scrip
was handed out (11 for four) from a
surplus of £4,3-31,718 (about half good-
will) on revaluation of assets. Then (Sept.,
1939) £996,941 of fresh ord. capital,
which brought with it £249,235 of share
premiums, was gathered. Thus paid
capital became £4,661;233 in 175,000 9
p.c. 1 cum. prefs. and 4,486,233 ords.
The £1,246,176 of new money put up
by shareholders at the outbreak of war
found ready employment in the new en-
gineering, plastics, metal-stamping, fibre-
carton making and other sections of the
business. A wide range of munitions was
turned out and charged to the Govern-
ment at cost. And £BO,OOO was volun-
tarily handed to the Treasury in connec-
tion with the manufacture of war goods.
Still, sufficient profit was earned since 1939
to pay pref. requirements, give the ords. an
average of a shade over 7 p.c. p.a. and, in
addition to the share premiums already
referred to, strengthen reserves by
£565,605. And 7 p.c. now is equal to
14.4 p.c. on ord. capital as it stood be-
fore the bonus issue, plus cash put up
by shareholders as capital and share pre-
miums since.
War ended about halfway through the
last term, and little time appears to have
been lost in switching from standardised
war products to the more varied output
called for by civilian trade. The fly in the
ointment has been industrial hold-ups,
resulting in shortage of coal and other
essential materials, with consequent slow-
ing-down of production and inevitable
increase in costs all along the line. Onty
a half-week’s supply of coal was received
at the Melbourne glass works over the
last quarter. Sales of old A.G.M.
Co., still the backbone of the organi-
sation, have doubled since war began,
but, owing to increased costs, earnings are
now “much less than they were in 1939,”
the chairman says. As soon as circum-
stances permit, “important manufacturing
developmerits will be proceeded with.”
There was a spring of £10,392 in com-
bined net earnings of the group last term.
But that was after setting aside £10,002
less for depreciation (£340,298) and allow-
ing whatever was considered necessary
for taxation and contingencies. It also
leaves out of the reckoning a loss of £7792
on sale of assets. The £402,578 of profit
covered the pref. div. and 8.6 p.c. on ord.
capital, compared with 8.4, 7.2, 6.9, 9.1,
8,8 and 9.3 p.c. back to 1940. The div.
was kept at 7 p.c. The £3,485,268 of re-
serves is subject to £2,373,661 of in-
tangibles.
Over the last few months the price of
the ords. fell from the ceiling figure of
61s. 9d. to 535. 6d. in the market, and
has since strengthened to 565. 9d. The
return at 565. 9d. is 2.4 p.c. on a 7 p.c,
div. basis. The investor at that price who
looks for a shade under 4 p.c. on his
money counts on the div. going to 11 p.c.
or upon other benefits. Pref. div. and 11
p.c. to the ords. would call for £509,235.
Although industry’s order book is full,
and looks like remaining so for some
time, the present high level of co. tax-
ation, continued uptrend of costs and the
Government’s policy of control are limit-
ing factors.
Balance-sheet figures reflect preparation

Considering the complications that mod-
ern legislation has created in connection
with the administration of estates, and’
the steep rise in costs, especially taxation,
these trustee cos continue to provide
highly efficient expert service at rela-
tively cheapening rates —their moderate
corpus and other commission charges are
anchored by legislation. Also earnings,
have been retarded by the official blanket
thrown over capital values and rents, and
by frequent turns of the cheap-money
screw.
Moreover, there is a limit to what
management can do to offset the
effects of factors outside its control. For
the five years to close bf accounts in
1945 this co.’s net earnings averaged
£11,849, compared with an average of
£12,123 for the preceding quinquennium.
Over the decade the net addition to the
volume of trusts on the books amounted
to £6,041,592, and £11,514 was added
to the co.’s own funds.
Last term new estates entrusted to the
co.’s care exceeded the value of those
wound up by £383,207:

Gross earnings stepped up £3135, but
exes, took all increase and £2791 besides.
The net result, poorest for over a de-
cade, was 9.5 p.c. on the £llO,OOO of
paid capital, as against 12.1, 11, 9.9, 10.1’,
10.6, 10.7 and 11.1 p.c. back to 1939.
On shareholders’ funds (capital and re-
serves combined) the year’s net result
was only 5.6 p.c., which suggests that the
trustee section of the business now turns
in very little profit. The 2\ p.c. bonus
that went out with the 8 p.c. div, for
the nine preceding years was dropped.
Prospects of its restoration depend
largely upon what happens in connection
with wage and other costs, and upon the
rate at which the business continues to
expand.
The market prices the £5 shares paid
to 11s. each —755. of the remaining 89s.
is callable only in the event of liquid-
ation—at the ceiling figure of 265. 3d.,
giving a return of 3.3 p.c. on an 8 p.c.
div. basis. Net tangible cover is 18s. Bd.
per share.
When the books closed the co.’s own
funds, together with £20,016 coming to
sundry creditors, were represented by
premises £51,321, mortgages £89,247,
Government securities £40,992, cash, etc.,
£25,359 and shares in the Canberra sub-
sidiary £5009.

The first post-war year was one of
hunger for goods, which means that
retailers were in clover. Merchandise,
including’imports, came forward in better
volume, though many lines remain in
short supply. In some cases goods sold
within a few hours, and sometimes
minutes, of being placed on the shelves.
Also, 200,000 sq. feet of the co.’s floor
space, taken over by the Government
during the war, was handed back last
term. Under these conditions Myer’s
turnover, which increased by £2,000,000,
was the best in the co.’s history. The per-
centage of gross profit was the lowest of
any store whose figures are published, the
chairman says. Of every pound received
from customers, 15s. represented cost to
the co. of goods purchased, 2s. 6d. wages
and salaries, Is. other expenses, 10.3 d.
taxation and 7.7 d. profit for shareholders.
The subsidiaries, too, had a prosperous
year. The vigorous Adelaide emporium
earned enough to pay its pref. div. and
show 17.7 p.c. on the £310,000 of ord.
capita], all of which is owned by the
Melbourne parent. The div. was kept at
7j p.c. The Myer woollen, knitting and
worsted spinning plants at Ballarat are
back on all-civilian output. Together
with the parent’s other internal supply
lines, the mills have been very helpful in
providing substitutes for scarcities and in
stepping up production of essentials.
The Economic Cash Buying Co., which
looks after short - term credit for the
parent’s customers, expanded its con-
nections. And the buying office in Lon-
don had its busiest year since war inter-
rupted the flow of imports.
After providing for depreciation
(£82,050, up £2943) but before allowing
for taxation, the spring in the parent’s net
earnings from all sources was £118,219:

able profit and partly to an alteration in

70 Years of
Service and Progress
THE ANNUAL REPORT FOR 1946 SHOWS THAT THE
T. & G. CONTINUES TO MAKE OUTSTANDING PROGRESS
NEW POLICIES — The popularity of the
Society is shown by the fact that existing Policy-
holders and new members purchased a record
amount of Assurance during the year. 132,669
new Life Policies iassuring £22,127,522, and
10,401 Accident and Sickness Policies assuring
£3,387,237, were effected.
ASSURANCES IN FORCE— Further
convincing evidence of the esteem in which the
Society is held is afforded by the total Assurances
in Force in the Ordinary and Industrial Depart-
ments, which increased to £142,877,607.
INCOME— The income for the year exceeded
£9,080,000, a record increase of more than
£750,000 on that of the previous year.
SECURITY— The Assets increased by
£3,623,000 to £52,426,000. They are invested in
first-class securities, and are held in trust to meet
Policy liabilities.
SERVICE —The T. & G. is a Mutual Life
Society. It is a truly co-operative Institution which
has no shareholders and is entirely owned by the
Policyholders. It aims to render the utmost service
to its members, and to settle all claims promptly.
Payments to Policyholders during the year exceeded
£3,740,000, more than £12,000 every working day
of the year.
GROUP ASSURANCE —The Society
specializes in Staff Superannuation and Group
Provident Schemes on terms most advantageous to
Employers and Employees. Many hundreds of
" such schemes have been entrusted to the Society.
A POLICY WITH THE T. & G. IS A PLEDGE
OF SECURITY PLUS SERVICE.
PURELY MUTUAL. NO SHAREHOLDERS.

The Australasian Temperance and General Mutual Life Assurance Society
Limited. (Incorporated in
the official method of valuing stock-in-
hand, which involved some arrears of
payment. The profit available for share-
holders (up £18,219) covered the pref.
and staff - partnership divs. (together
£64,960) and 11.1 p.c. on the £1,725,000
of ord. capital compared with 10.2, 7.3,
7.2, 7.4, 12, 14.3 and 13 p.c. back to 1939.
The ord. distribution was lifted half a
point, making it 9 p.c. again.
Principal factors determining the level
of store profits today are the volume of
sales, costs and gross profit margins.
Costs are on the up-grade, and price
control has placed an upper limit on the
margin between buying and selling
prices. This means, among other things,
that competition has less influence upon
mark-up on these lines than it used to.
When the present scarcity demand has
been satisfied, the volume of trade will
depend largely upon the level of employ-
ment. Myer’s is exceptionally well
equipped to earn whatever profit is to be
won from the trade.
The year’s brisker turnover is further
reflected in balance-sheet figures:

for an extra £290,093 and drew upon
cash, etc., for £364,537. The improve-
ment in the more or less liquid surplus
(£1,525,236) was £11,261.
At 41s. (ceiling) the pound ords. —they

(consolidated balance-sheet) is 335. 9d.
ords. and £5 11s. lid. prefs.
Sunshine Gold is getting ready to start
up again on its sluicing claims on the
Watut River, New Guinea. The co. has
received an advance payment of £lO,OOO
in respect of war damage to plant, build-
ings and equipment, which cost £38,691 ;
full settlement is expected during the
current term. Re-erection of main per-
manent buildings, including store, Euro-
pean mess and engineer’s shop, has been
completed, repairs to the Baiune water-
race, which conveys the water to work
the property, have commenced, and
new sluicing equipment, now on order,
is nearing completion, and will be shipped
as space becomes available. Conditions
now regulating employment of native
labor are retarding rehabilitation work,
and will increase future operating costs.
The management hopes to offset this in-
crease by economies in other directions.
In 1940 the co. treated 404,712 c.y. for
6857.290 z. gold, an average of 8.13 gr.
per yard. Costs were sluicing 6d., ad-
ministration Id. and gold tax 4jd. There
is about 15 years’ work ahead.
Wiluna Gold Mines (W.A.), paid
capital £1,559,012, is to cease under-
ground operations on December 21, pay
ore having failed to live at depth. Since
its inception in 1926, the co., which is a
subsidiary of Wiluna Gold Corp.
(London), paid divs. totalling 52i p.c., the
last being in 1936. Interest now centres
mainly in retreatment of some 400,000
tons of refractory calcine residues, aver-
aging 6dwt. gold, and in the co.’s
options. Work on the residues began in
September, 1945, and is.expected to keep
about 80 men employed for the next three
years. The co. has a 75 p.c. interest in the
Mt. Charlotte option, Kalgoorlie, where
vertical drilling to 800 ft. has indicated
that a large tonnage of pay-ore awaits
development, which is to begin as soon
as labor and equipment can be assembled
for the purpose. A one-third interest is
also held in a 300-acre block, including
the Porphyry mine, on the North Cool-
gardie field. Here some 6000 ft. of drilling
has disclosed a flat ore-body expected to
contain at least 350,000 tons, averaging
4.5dwt., and development is expected to
disclose further tonnage. Some months
back a couple of other properties were
also being tested under option in joint
partnership with Gold Fields Australian
Development, but results have not been
broadcast.

“O.B.”; Edna May (W.A.), past and
present. This show had a golden 10
years from 1912, paying about £400,000
in dividends on a capital of £25,000.
When about half of this wealth had been
distributed, the mine was almost drowned
by a very heavy inflow of water —about
1000 gallons a minute. Mick Williams,
then general manager, rushed to Wal-
halla, hauled the pumps out of the Long
Tunnel mine and transported them to
Edna May. They kept the water under
control until a reduction in grade of ore
made the mine unprofitable, with gold
at the old price of 85s. an ounce. Later,
encouraged by the rise in gold price,
Edna May Amalgamated was formed in
Melbourne to reopen the old show. The
flooded workings were unwatered, new
shafts were sunk and a lot of develop-
ment and boring was done, but little
fortune attended this big effort. There
are optimists who believe that further
development might prove worth while,
but Edna May Amalgamated doesn’t
appear to share the belief.
* * * *
Net liquid resources of Gold Fields
Australian Development, Ltd., and of
Moonlight Wiluna Co., which it wholly
owns, amounted to £307,000 at end of 1945.
Co. operates in Westralia through Moon-
light Wiluna, whose goldmining interests
comprise properties at Wiluna and Mt.
Ida, a 33i p.c. interest in an option to
purchase the Porphyry, near Edjudina, a
25 p.c. interest in an option on the, Mt.
Charlotte property, and a holding in
Yellowdine Gold Development, Ltd. At
Gold Fields’ recent annual meeting chair-
man Geikie said costs were steadily ris-
ing, owing to increases in wages and the
price of machinery, fuel and every item
used in mining. Unless checked, it will
not be long before this upward move-
ment will eliminate treatment of low-
grade and marginal ores. Producers
cannot pass on increased costs.
* * *
Westralian Gold: As the Mt. Monger
mine is “no longer a profitable com-
pany venture,” it has, together with plant,
been handed over to tributors. The
chairman says the co. (New Milano) is
looking for a new property, and, if suc-
cessful, a call will be made to finance
an option and do some prospecting....
Lake View and Star reports that normal
development was suspended on June 13,
owing to shortage of explosives, and not
resumed until September 2... .Sterling
Mines, N.L., has purchased the Makale
block at Kintore, near Coolgardie, on
which Australian Gold Fields Develop-
ment, Ltd., abandoned an option
some time ag0.... Westralian goldmin-
ing cos.’ dividends for 1946 are expected
to exceed £400,000, a rise of approxi-
mately £60,000 on those for 1945.

"FOUNTAINS BEYOND."
“Fountains Beyond,” by George Lan-
den Dann, put on by the New Theatre,
Melbourne, is a sincere and sympathetic
attempt by an Australian to portray the
problem of the Australian aboriginal.
The action takes place in the main
room of the Filmers’ household in
one of those ragtag settlements of
natives, full-blood and half-caste; which
decorate coastal towns in Queensland.
This one happens to be on the site which
the townsfolk want for a children’s play-
ground, and Mr. Watson, a worthy citizen
with aspirations for the mayorship, has
the projected playground as the main
plank in his platform. He introduces
Miss Hartnett, an English writer com-
missioned to write a book about Aus-
tralia, to the Filmer household with the
bright idea that they might assist him to
organise a corroboree for her. The cor-
roboree is brilliantly successful.
The authoress then goes north and sees
something of the native untouched as yet
by civilisation, and when she returns she
finds the civilised abos in process of
eviction, the corroboree having provided
all the necessary funds for the children’s
playground. She thus gets a totally un-
expected insight into the abo. problem.
There is a somewhat forced touch about
her analysis of the situation; but other-
wise there is no obviousness of propa-
ganda to submerge the human problem.
This is the triangular conflict between
Vic, the half-caste, married to the full-
blood Peggy, who has Wally, a ne’er-do-
well, for a lover.
Vic picks up a rifle to kill his rival,
under the tribal constitution a fair-enough
proceeding, in fact, obligatory on his
honor, but under the white-man’s law
a crime that merits hanging. The rifle
goes off, the wife is killed and the hus-
band picks up the body with the intention
of making north in his boat with the last
full-blood representative of his race, an
aged abo. The latter part, by courtesy
of the Australian Aboriginal League, was
taken, and very well taken, by Eric Onus,
the dignified spokesman for his race in
Melbourne,
Charles Stanley was the outstanding
figure in the cast as the husband who
fights for the vanishing rights of his
people and possession o| his household.
Margery Otway was excellent as his wife
and Keith Newport was good as the
reactionary Wally. Charles McCormack
was the prospective rural mayor, and just
like one.
“Shadow and Substance”
This, by P. V, Carroll, and put on by
the Victoria League at the Radio Theatre,
Sydney, is an exasperating play. Its treat-
ment of the clash between austere
theology and the workaday version—be-
tween the intellect and the emotions, to
state it simply—is intriguing. But the
case on either side is not fully stated, and
the end of the play is easily foreseen.
Lucy Clifford played the difficult part of
the vision-seeing maid, Brigid, well. She
was too consistently sweet, but then so
was Brigid. G. J. Pooley, as O’Flingsley,
the schoolmaster who wrote an anti-
clerical book and set a whole Irish
countryside by the ears, was good, except
that his brogue was painful to listen to.
B. Moorehead, as the canon, looked the
part and acted in a satisfying and plaus-
ible manner, although more could have
been extracted from the part by a subtler
interpretation of the canon’s aristocratic
brand of irony.
Willem Noske
Willem Noske. a tall, dark, aesthetic-
looking young Hollander who has been
fiddling to the Indonesians, turned up at
the Assembly Hall, Melbourne, at the
tail-end of the concert season and gave a
recital which was remarkable inasmuch
as it included works by Dutch composers
of whom few music-lovers have. ever
heard. Willem de Fesch was an
eighteenth-century composer who, like
Handel, immigrated to London, where he
wrote many operas and oratorios. His
Violin Sonata in E minor, played sensi-
lively-by Mr. Noske, is lovely enough
to be included in any programme. In
Beethoven’s Sonata for violin
and piano the violinist had that fine
musician Eunice Garland to assist him,
and there was an admirable liaison be-
tween the two performers, though the
Noske bow seemed to falter a trifle in the
second movement.
“The Messiah”
Clarity, force and precision are suffi-
ciently rare in choral work to make them
noteworthy when they appear, as they
did in the performance of Handel’s
“Messiah” at Sydney Town Hall on
Saturday night by the Hurlstone Choral
Society under Vivian Peterson in con-
junction with the Sydney Symphony
Orchestra. The tightly-disciplined chorus,
working with an orchestra in good trim,
had a galvanic effect on the soloists,
soprano Leah Morris, contralto Evelyn
Hall, tenor William Herbert and basso
Stanley Clarkson, the last-named getting
off some particularly fine declamatory
passages.

Elizabeth Durack’s Painting
Elizabeth Durack’s picture sequence
“Time and Tide,” at Melbourne
Athenaeum, tackles the story of Roebuck
Bay in n.-w. Australia, She has evidently
been excited by the romance, squalor,
muck and muddle of the pearling outpost
where abos, Japs, Filipinos, Chinese and
other Asiatic races were mixed in a sea-
pie of miscegenation.
The story starts with the old man of
the tribe re-creating for an audience of
two piccaninnies the tale that has been
handed down from generation to genera-
tion of coastal abos of the huge, three-
toed bird whose footprints made the in-
dentations geographically known as Roe-
buck Bay. It goes on by linking up the
pearl that Cleopatra swallowed at a cer-
tain celebrated banquet with possible
Phoenician voyages to Australia, then to
the visit of Dampier and up to modern
times and the day when Broome was
visited by Jap bombers.
The pictorial story finishes with a
glimpse into the future when the ming-
ling of the races will produce a new race
in this backblocks of civilisation. In be-
tween are portraits of old Chinamen,
half-castes, Yusop, bulwark of the
Chinese Nationalist party, and all the
human debris gathered round the
Christian missions.
Miss Durack’s show is of entirely dif-
ferent order from that of Eric Stephen-
sen’s, at the Velasquez, though Mr.
Stephensen has also gone to the abo, for
subject-matter. Mr. Stephensen has
brought a sophisticated mind to the busi-
ness and produced a series of conven-
tional illustrations. Miss Durack has
obviously felt her subject-matter; Mr,
Stephensen hasn’t.
Richard Ashton
Oils, water-colors and drawings by
Richard Ashton, exhibited in the gallery
of the Royal Art Society, Sydney, are
competent but unimpressive. Without
any glaring faults of technique, the paint-
ings are mostly stiff and wooden —color-
less despite hard blue skies and lavish
greens and the various shades of vegeta-
tion in New Guinea, Katoomba and
Sydneyside landscapes. The drawings—
“ Types, New Guinea,” “Types, White and
Yellow” and “P.O.Ws. at Wewak” —
are no better or worse than many sketches
by soldiers wjth a talent with the pencil,
the water-colors are slight, and the oils
are depressingly uniform. Of these,
“Katoomba Landscape,” with a rocky
wooden rise, has most spontaneity, while
“The Canoe Builders” has a purple mist
on the horizon which is an improvement
on most of the artist’s sea-water.
At the Talkies.
“Anna and the King of Siam”
Rex Harrison, as the king in this Syd-
ney Regent offering, has a pack of
trouble. His harem consists of 1000
wives and his family of 46 children—
he married late in life. So when Anna
(Irene Dunne) arrives on the scene as a
governess it seems certain that he will
turn his toes up in despair before the
last reel. Turn ’em up he finally does,
in his throne-room, utterly henpecked
by Miss Dunne, who does not approve
one bit of his custom of burning-off
now and then to reduce the number of
his wives. With his passing the film is
relieved of its only player who ap-
proaches good acting.
“The Yearling”
“Ooo,” said the girl in the back row
between ice creams, “isn’t it love-ly,”
which, considering the girl, the ice
creams and the picture, was an accurate
criticism of this current offering at Syd-
ney St. James and Liberty.
That Hollywood will wax sentimental
over two such unsentimental things as
Nature and children is a pretty safe bet;
with a combination of both ingredients
in the one film the bet is money in the
bank. Despite the fact that “The
Yearling” is about a small pioneering
family battling against floods, wild ani-
mals and other things to extract a living
from a small clearing in the Florida
jungle ; despite the fact that its main char-
acter is a boy (Claude Jarman, Jr.) who
finds and rears a faun and then has to
shoot it when it persists in destroying the
meagre crops; despite his tight-lipped
mother (played surprisingly well by Jane
Wyman) embittered by the loss of three
children —despite all that and several
other glimpses which suggest the sub-
stance of the original story, the film re-
mains as sustained a length of techni-
color sentimentality as any sentimental
girl with ice cream could wish for.
“Caravan”
From the opening scenes —which intro-
duce a young man familiar with gipsies,
handy with his fists and battling to earn
a literary crust in London —it seems that
this film at Sydney Esquire is to be a
story of or by George Borrow. Even
Borrow, however, in his fanciest flights
of imagination, never conceived anything
like the adventures that follow. The
young man (Stewart Granger) is packed
off to Spain to deliver a priceless bauble
in diamonds, leaving his true love to wait
for him in London until he returns with
his fortune. He is done over in fine
style by a bunch of Spanish brigands,
and recovers consciousness, but not his
memory, to find himself being nursed in
a cave by a comely member of the
Czincali. After an idyllic romance in the
mountains he regains his memory, dis-
covers that his English lass has wed her-
self to a rascally English lordling, and
thereupon returns to his cave and matri-
mony with the gipsy wench. All of
which is insufficient to fill the allotted
running time, so murder and other may-
hem is introduced to pass away another
half-hour and reduce the cast to the num-
ber necessary for a single-barrelled
romance. _

YOUR SHOUT!
AND IT'S
RED MILL RUM.
A violent thunderstorm accqmpanied by a
furious wind burst upon Canterbury during the
running of the first race on Saturday. Punters
going to collect after the favorite, Parfait, had
won found bookies ruefully . contemplating
umbrellas blown inside out by the gale. Ihere-
after odd showers fell from time to time;
otherwise a particularly good day s racing,
with eight events and large fields.
“Don’t break up a winning combination,”
“Don’t change your tactics when you’re win-
ning,” and “Don’t change horses in midstream
are a few axioms on which trainer Plant, owner
Romano and jockey Mulley may be ruminating.
Last season the combination coudn’t put a foot
wrong, but since Plant and Romano came to a
parting of the ways with Mulley neither side has
had an ounce of luck. On Saturday, with
Briscoe now doing the stable riding, three of
Plant’s charges, two of them owned by Romano,
finished close seconds. / - i
The first to go under was Chanson Gai,
beaten a neck by Parfait (J. Thompson) in the
first Maiden Handicap, Mhimbil being third.
Having filled four minor places from five starts,
Chanson Gai, a three-year-old Merry Matthew
filly, seems unlucky to be still a maiden. Then
in the first division of the Three-year-old Han-
dicap Plant’s representative, Dutchman, lost a
photo.-finish to the grey Nizami gelding Hiraji.
It was a fine finish, with Hiraji and Dutchman
battling neck and neck for nearly a furlong
and Star Vite flashing into the picture just a
trifle too late. Navajo, a Le Grand Due filly,
broke her leg in this race and had to be de-
stroyed on the spot.
In the six-furlongs Flying, Plant had Hall
Stand, who looked the winner nearing the post,
but was fairly outstayed by a rough ’un in
Yankee Lad. Plant could be excused for look-
ing daggers at young T. Mullane, who rode
both Hiraji and Yankee Lad, and it would not
increase the trainer’s happiness to recall that
the only jockey who has won on .Hall Stand in
the past 20-odd months was Mulley.
Darby Munro’s emerging from semi-retire-
ment to take the mount on Silver Link
in the Canterbury Handicap seemed to
suggest something to punters, who quickly
made the Brueghel gelding a warm favorite,
though his appearance indicated that he needed
the run. At no stage of the race did he look
like winning. Last as they rounded the turn,
he finished on strongly in the straight tt> bag
third place behind Open Air and Prince Verity.
F. Williams on Open Air went straight to the
front and took no risks, riding the Fresco horse
right out to the post though he had lengths
to spare.
Though she hadn’t faced the starter before,
Profound, a Valiant Chief filly trained by F. T.
Cush and ridden by W. Cook, was well sup-
ported for the Two-year-old Handicap, in which
she scored an effortless win. Also both having
their first run in a race, Prince Mohican was
second and Prince Brueghel third. Profound
was bred and is raced by Mr. and Mrs. L. R.
Morgan.
After riding three seconds Briscoe finally
pulled his followers out of the mire by bring-
ing home Parramatoo at 15 to 1 in the second
Three-year-old. Parramatoo downed Tamasha,
who’s always near the money but has yet to
win, and My Hero, a consistent son *of Ajax
likely to win in the near future. The second
Maiden Handicap went to Grovetown (E.
Doon), a strikingly marked son of the English
Derby winner Coronach. He’s a bright chest-
nut with white nose and hind feet and long
silver mane and tail. Finishing second ahead
of Raceme, Mr. Stanaway ran like a coming
winner. Improving on his good effort at Rand-
wick a week previously, and with G. Pownall
replacing Mulley in the saddle, Agile at 20 to 1
defeated Right Royal and Nigeria in the
Welter.
* * * *
A pleasant afternoon and good racing at
Moonee Valley on Saturday, but the attend-
ance again only moderate. Tote figures show
the extent of the rebound from the war-time
racing boom. A comparison between the
figures for this season so far on main Mel-
bourne courses and the corresponding period
last season reveals a decline of nearly £136,000.
Atoning for their comparative lapse at Men-
tone the previous week, representatives of the
Dhoti breed got right back into the thick of
things, winning three of the seven races, or
rather two and a half, Leonard sharing first
place with Spanish Legend in the mile Essen-
don Handicap. Leonard possibly should have
won. Breasley had him in a nice position on
the rails in about fourth place most of the way,
but halfway down the straight, despairing of
getting a clear run, switched to the outside.
Leonard hung out for some distance, and when
eventually straightened up was only able to
draw level with Spanish Legend, Lugano being
third to the dead-heaters.
At Mentone, when having his first start in a
race, Double Trouble (Dhoti-Judy O’Shea) was
just pipped by Royal Mark in circumstances
which resulted in the latter’s rider landing a
three months’ suspension. In Saturday’s Glen-
bervie Plate for two-year-old colts and geldings
Double Trouble, ridden by Badger, avoided
any possibility of his name proving too apt
by leaping straight into the lead and remaining
there. At the finish he was four lengths clear of
Two Kings, giving the judge plenty of time to
decide that Astor and Birmingham had tied
for the minor placing. Double Trouble cost
1100 guineas as a yearling and should prove
cheap at that; two starts have returned well
over half his cost.
A similar event for fillies, the Moreland
Stakes, in which Eba was the popular choice,
went to another Dhoti in Surma, who is from
The Night Patrol mare Battle Royal. Ridden
by J. Purtell and wearing the colors of E. A.
Underwood, who breeds the Dhotis, Surma ran
smartly throughout and finished too stoutly for
Del Rose and Athenaeum, though Del Rose is
worth’ keeping in mind; her chances weren’t
improved by her being forced four horses .wide
round the turn.
Orthodox, who distinguished himself by being
the only maiden performer to compete in the
last Melbourne Cup, finally won a race—the
“Now, I ask you, what's Christmas without a bit of mistletoe?”
Bulla Handicap over 13 Mokan was
favorite, but for the third time in succession
finished second. A strong run begun at the
half-mile had carried Mokan very close to the
leaders, Orthodox and Hartnell, as they
rounded the turn, but, while Mokan pegged
Hartnell back, Orthodox was going too well
and still had a couple of lengths in hand at the
post. Orthodox was ridden by Pur tell, who,
being also on Surma and Spanish Legend,
had a fair day.
Breasley is not these days striking the suc-
cess he enjoyed last season —he doesn’t seem
to be getting the openings for the run along the
rails which used to bring him so many wins.
Leonard was a case in point on Saturday, and
San Fairy Anne, his mount in the Somerton
Handicap, was another. After taking San Fairy
Anne to the rails round the turn, Breasley had
to switch back to the outside in the straight;
the filly finished gamely, but Flying Fury (V.
Hartney) and Glendinning led her home.
Flying Fury is one of K. G. Luke’s double
“F” nomenclature, and, like Glendinning, is
a bay colt by Hellespont.
The first division of the Fawkner Welter
was won by Grand Gift (R. Hutchinson), a
six-year-old Manitoba gelding. Though his only
previous success was in a Maiden event at
Pakenhara recently, Grand Gift was well
backed at good odds and won well, taking 1.13
to beat St. Dandy and Somers. In the second
division Verdict (W. Richards) took 1.13| in
winning from Chatfield and Hellenist.
« * * *
The jockeys’ strike in Perth ended, as well
it should have, with the W.A.T.C. assuring the
boys that in future an ambulance would fol-
low races on metropolitan courses.
* * * *
Mechanical innovations this year have been
the magic-eye camera (on Melbourne and Syd-
ney courses) and the starting boxes, as yet
installed only on the S.T.C.’s courses, Canter-
bury and Rosehill. The camera is a boon,
particularly to judges, since it eliminates loud-
mouthed disputing of the verdict. It is still
open to improvement, mechanical, or, pos-
sibly, in the human element handling it. A
photo, was called for and not forthcoming
on one occasion in Melbourne because the
op'erator had set the camera going too soon
and had run out of film. There was another
mix-up in Sydney when, an operator having
mishandled and blurred the wet film, the judge
gave a minor placing to the wrong horse. All
minor faults which can be corrected.
• When first introduced in parts of the U.S.A.,
the camera, contrary to expectations, recorded
a surprising number of dead-heats. There has
been so far only one in Australia and that
for a minor placing.
Starting-boxes, though almost unanimously
approved by owners, trainers and jockeys, seem
a different matter. They reduce the likelihood
of a horse being kicked at the start, and they
spread ’em apart so that there is less inter-
ference in the dive for position over the first
50 yards. But they certainly don’t expedite
starts (if anything, causing greater delay);
they over-empbasise the element of luck in
the barrier-draw; unruly customers still have
to be sent to the outside; and, perish any evil
thought, a good deal of horse and rider is
obscured from the starter’s sight.

Second Test:
A huge crowd —the biggest present onlooker
has seen at Sydney Cricket Ground before the
start of a match—saw Hammond win the toss-
for England in the second Test on Friday. For
conditions all round, Hammond couldn’t have
picked a better day ; clear, warm sunshine, the
pitch apparently excellent.
Miller opened the bowling, and an Australian
attack can’t often have been started with a
worse over. It was erratic without being threat-
ening. A vision arose of England scoring a
thousand.
Miller improved subsequently, but the first
wicket, Washbrook’s, fell to a beautiful ball
from Freer, scattering the stumps. Bradman
varied the attack, calling in Toshack and Tribe,
and, after lunch, Johnson and McCool. The
last-named pair were no time on the job before
more English wickets were falling; Hutton,
Compton ‘and Hammond all joining Wash-
brook in the stand before the century was
raised.
McCool at this Stage had bagged 2 for 5.
Johnson’s figures were just as remarkable, his
first five overs yielding one run and including
one wicket —and this under what looked abso-
lutely ideal batsmen’s conditions.
Apparently belying its good looks, the pitch
suited the spin bowlers all the afternoon. At
any rate, they got the wickets, Jphnson, par-
ticularly, carrying on a remarkably accurate
sustained performance to bag 4 for 31 in 25
overs, 11 of them maidens. But the Australian
performance of the day was Tallon’s wicket-
keeping. He caught Hutton, Compton, Ham-
mond and Yardley, and at all times looked the
most dangerous element in the Australian side.
In the circumstances, Hutton’s 39, Edrich’s
71 and Ikin’s 52 were stout performances in
England’s 219 for 8 wickets on the first day.
Saturday was mainly Johnson taking the
last two English wickets and the big crowd
taking a drenching from a thunderstorm. The
tailenders lifted the pnglish total to 255.
As in Brisbane, Australian opener Morris
failed to get going ; he turned his back on a
leg ball from Edrich, and it bounced off his
thigh to his wicket. Barnes started as if accept-
ing the role of Australian opener-in-chief, and
was 21, with the total 1 for 27, when successive
appeals against the dark at last ended play, the
crowd heading for home feeling that it had
never had less for its money. Another huge
crowd got better value on Monday, the weather
perfect and Barnes batting solidly.
Tallon has had a great season. For Q. v.
M.C.C. he stumped four and caught two, and
he caught three in the first Test at Brisbane.
lan Johnson didn’t get a bowl in the first
Test at Brisbane. With the Australian XI in
M.L. last year his figures were 8 for 179, with
4 for 47 v. Otago the best effort. Against the
Services XI in Melbourne he took 6 for 27
and 4 for 17. He is a right-hand off-spin
bowler. Johnson and Freer each took a wicket
in his opening Test over.
* * * *
Sustaining his splendid form, Von
Nida won the Australian professional
golf championship at Manly (N.S.W.) on
Saturday, though he had to play like a
demon to beat off Eric Cremin. Coming
from behind most of the way, Cremin
almost squared the match when, four
down and four to go, he won three in a
row and forced the champion" to play a
hard chip to the last green for a half.
Both players were under par despite
the thunderstorm With heavy rain.
* * * *
After all the fuss the James-Patrick
engagement for the Empire lightweight
championship fell through, the Welsh in-
vader being unable to get, within 111 b. of
the maximum weight, 9.9. The title is
vacant, and if James has outdeveloped
the poundage limit the British Board is
expected to dig out another contender,
though it ought to be equally open to any
Dominion to produce one; the last
holder was South African Laurie Stevens.
* H= *
Relying a bit too much on his face for
defensive purposes, Tommy Hunter (lOst.
111 b.) was easily outpointed by Tommy
Ward (lOst. IQlb.) at Leichhardt. Hunter
looked much heavier than announced
and used his extra tonnage roughing
Ward, but a gashed 4 right eyebrow
in round five was as good as finish. In
fact. Hunter was overgame to keep on.
* * * *
Jim Dougherty (list. l\Vo) hit too hard
and oft for Col Parker (list. at
Sydney Stadium. Parker was twice down
for “eight” and “nine” in the second
round and was still more or less “out”
when he came forth for round three.
He took a right to the chin and his head
hit the floor with a bang, whereafter he
was taken to hospital, but allowed, to go
home after observation. Tommy Watts
(9st. B|lb.) stopped Norm Arthur (9st.
s|lb.) in round eight of the other 12-
rounder. Beaten from the first bell,
Arthur was helpless when ref. Wallis
called it off.

Wages Unpegged
The Full Arbitration Court in Mel-
bourne has granted an interim increase
in the basic wage of 7s. a week in all
States except in Tasmania, where the rise
is 6s. The increase is over and above
additions based on the growth in the
cost of living since wage-pegging began,
and on first view would appear to be
similar to the loading granted under the
“Reddaway award” nine years ago.
Already since the war began the average
Commonwealth basic wage has increased
from 795. to 98s. by virtue of cost-of-
living additions. But it is generally ad-
mitted that the cost of living has ex-
panded considerably more than the
Statistician’s index of household expenses,
etc;, suggests.
In addition to the interim rise in the
wage, the Prime Minister has announced
a relaxation of the wage-pegging regu-
lations so as to permit industrial tribunals
to revise margins paid for skill, etc., in
addition to the basic wage. Revision of
loadings will also be permitted. It re-
mains to be seen, however, whether “war
loadings,” still being paid in some in-
dustries—especially the mercantile marine
—will be removed under this power.
This job is in the hands of the Maritime
Industry Commission. Obviously justice
to the community cannot be dispensed by
one-way traffic in these matters. Mer-
chant seamen are still being paid a “war-
risk” bonus principally because the Gov-
ernment is scared to do its duty.
The award of an extra 7s. a week being
of an interim nature it has yet to be
made clear whether the Court will ulti-
mately regard it as a cost-of-living in-
crease, to be adjusted in the light of a more
representative statistical index, or whether
it is indeed intended as an addition to
real wages—like the “Reddawage”—and
not merely to money wages. In the latter
case a more truthful cost-of-living index
will probably, eventually, bring a further
substantial increase in wages. It is im-
portant that it be decided whether the
present addition is meant to be an in-
crease in real wages within, eventually,
an economy free from price and other
controls, or whether it is merely a con-
cession to present artificial conditions.
The value to the nation of the rise in
wages, estimated to cost £26 million a
year, will depend upon whether trade-
unionists now set about doing the amount
of work of which they are quite capable
but which, under dictation of union
bosses and shop stewards, they have
wantonly refused to do for several years
past. Slow, reduced production in key
industries means high costs to the con-
sumer —which in turn fiieans a low
standard of living. If wage-earners fail
to return to pre-war rates of production
and, with the aid of mechanical improve-
ments, try to better them, then the wage
increase will merely amount to another
shot of inflation in our costs and prices
structure, though at that perhaps no more
than an acknowledgment of the credit
inflation that has already been created by
war-time and post-war Government

The cost of the war to Australia in
goods and services was far greater than
the amount of taxation taken from the
people to help pay for war—heavy though
that taxation was. In order to get ob-
structive trade-unionists to work, “load-
ings” and'overtime rates were increased,
and “the workers” entered a period of
paper-money prosperity. Deposits in sav-
ings banks rose .prodigiously, but. living
standards fell for two reasons—firstly
because the demand for production for
war purposes took goods from civilian
“Yairs, I DID pinch the ton o' food from the ship's 'old, but y' Wouldn't
see a poor cow STARVE, would y'?"
reach, and secondly because “the
workers” in the majority of key industries
reduced their hourly rate of output.
Though most industries have now
swung back to civilian production, the
rate of output per worker, on the whole,
is so low that living standards of all are
well below normal. In some industries
pre-war ‘total production has been
achieved; but the number of persons in
employment is now far greater than in
1939, and the consuming population is
greater. From every rational viewpoint,
in order to do himself and his country a
good turn, the wage-earner should be
willingly doing a fair day’s work for fair
pay. Unless trade-unionism decides to
restore production to a reasonable thing
the prospect ahead of the Commonwealth
wage-increases notwithstanding re-
mains one of rising costs, lower living
standards and continuous industrial strife
in which Communist treachery will play
its full part.
Though the war is over, taxation rates
remain high. High rates are understand-
able up to a point; but, while costs in-
flation plainly goes on in industry, the
Federal Labor Government continues to
indulge in Budgetary inflation, encourag-
ing laziness and indiscipline in many in-
dustries and exposing the flanks of private
enterprise to the same demoralisation.
Rebellious trade-unionists soon find them-
selves recipients of Government bounty,
provided by taxpayers, whenever they go
on strike or are locked out by exasperated
employers.
It would have been far better for the
Australian economy if, instead of a mere
lift in wages, a reduction in taxes had
accompanied a more moderate wage-rise.
A tax reduction might bring about a
much-to-be-desired cut in Government
expenditure, and at the same time restrain
inflationary forces both within and out-
side the field of Government finance.
Actual pegging of wages and prices has
only a temporary value. The original
idea was to curb the inevitable war-time
inflation until such a time as full peace-
time production returned and the
supply of goods would again rise to meet
demand and controls would be unneces-
sary. Heavy taxation, high central-Gov-
ernment spending and industrial discipline
occurring almost under Government
patronage have combined to defer the
return of productivity to the level of con-
sumer demand. , The, nation will now
watch to see whether the increase in the
basic wage will do what all manner of
threats. Government crawling and “con-
cessions” have previously failed to
achieve.
Incentives for Wage-earners
Systems of incentive-payments to em-
ployees have been prescribed recently by
several company-directors as the antidote
for our industrial disorders. Their argu-
ments were held to be important enough
for the calling of a one-day conference
by the Institute of Industrial Manage-
ment, and delegates from all States
attended in Melbourne on December 4.
Various systems which have already
operated successfully were described to
the conference by their sponsors. An
extreme case was Lincoln Electric Co.
(Aust.) Pty., which follows a system’ of
profit-sharing, with consultations on
policy between the management and
spokesmen for the workers. Each em-
ployee has received in profits an average
of £lOO a year over the last five years ;
and results, according to the directors,
are harmony, high output and competitive
prices.
Methods of others were more orthodox.
Pieceworkers at H. V. McKay-Massey
Harris are receiving an average of 40
p.c. more than award rates. Rocla, Ltd.,
has introduced a kind of modified Bedaux
system, with a resulting increase of 20
p.c. in both output and wages. A repre-
sentative of Prestige, Ltd., claimed
similar success.
To the trade-union bosses, all these
measures are unpalatable. A series of
objections placed before the conference
by P. J. Clarey, president of the A.C.T.U.
and Victoria’s Minister for Labor, re-
solved itself into airy denials of the im-
proved results, evidence of which had
already been given, or instances of em-
ployment where everyone realises the
systems could not be applied ; or histories
of past abuses by avaricious employers
and of inequitable systems, now generally
discarded.
To a direct question from R. G. Casey
as to whether the incentive-system was
capable of reform to the satisfaction of the
unions Mr. Clarey answered that it was not.
Mr. Clarey’s cure-all for industrial dis-
content was that “workers” should re-
ceive a greater share in the national in-
come and be allowed “a greater share of
leisure.” During the war, in production
activity, Australia “had held her own
with the rest of the world.” Mr. Clarey
should know that during the war, in
spite of a huge share in the paper-money
income created by the .Labor Govern-
ment, many “workers,” especially in
highly-unionised industries, cut their out-
put of goods and services deliberately,
and this reduction is still in progress —
obvious on the wharves and among
N.S.W. bricklayers. Attitude of the
“workers” continues to prevent the
creation of a decent amount of produc-
tion in which they and everyone else can
share.
The Trades Hall antipathy to incentive-
payments really derives from a cause not
listed by Mr. Clarey—the fear that
bonuses and profit-participation would
attach workers more closely to their firms,
with a weakening of trade-union ties.
Union officials have a vested interest in
industrial discontentment.
Olympic Tyre and Rubber is trans-
ferring its electric-cable division to a
separate co., Olympic Cables, Ltd., for
£191j457 in ord. shares of ss. each. After
the separation of the cable business from
the tyre section is completed, share-
holders in Olympic Tyre will receive one
ord. share in the cable co. for each Tyre
ord. now held (696,000 are issued), and
the issue will be treated as a return of
Tyre capital, reducing each £1 ord. to 15s.
Olympic Tyre will retain 69,828 cable-co.
shares. After the capital reduction
Olympic Tyre will split its 15s. shares
into ss. scrip, and the net result will be
that' present shareholders will receive
three ss. tyre-co. shares and one cable-co.
ss. share for each original £1 share now
held. An issue of 5 p.c. prefs. for cash
is then proposed by both cos., 198,857
by the tyre co. and 51,055 by the cable
co., all of £1 each. It is difficult to see
the practical value of the separation of
the cable and tyre sections of the busi-
ness, as well as the dispersal of owner-
ship, but some may exist; on the other
hand, there is nothing to commend the
subdivision of the Olympic Tyre shares
into ss. counters. On the Stock Ex-
change the result of this kind of thing in
the past has usually increased specula-
tion, with comparatively inflated prices
during “bull” periods. With a free-
market price of perhaps 50s. a £1 share
there is no call for this subdivision. It
is when £1 shares rise above £5 each
that subdivision may be called for.

K. G. Healing, in his address to share-
holders in A. G, Healing, Ltd.:
This country should be proud of the job
it did in keeping prices and wages under
control during the stress of war, and surely
an alteration to this position now would
jeopardise the splendid position in which
this country has established itself. Obvi-
ously, as a rise in wages must mean a
corresponding rise in prices, the solution
to our trouble does not lie in this direction.
Surely, even to the uninitiated, the answer
must be obvious; leave the cost of wages
where they are and get down the cost of
living, so as to give the basic wage its
true value. The solution to this aspect is
a very simple one. Production can be in-
creased by incentive payment, and retail
prices of material will drop, while wages,
as well as rising, will accumulate a greatei
purchasing power.
Secondly—and much the easier and more
important step —is a decrease in the present
staggering taxation rate. That income tax
should come down and ease the position
is obvious, but the less obvious answer
lies in indirect taxation. William Pitt the
younger it was who said: “Give me the
weapon of indirect taxation and I could
take the bread from their mouths and they
would put it down to hard times.” This
position is rapidly being brought abtput
today by the grossly unfair sales tax, which
is undoubtedly the greatest attribute of
today’s high cost of living.
In 1945-46 Customs and excise revenue
were £5,960,000 above estimates, and
sales tax was £5,600,000 beyond fore-
casts.. Only a small sales-tax concession
has been made in the 1946-47 Budget, and
the basic-wage rise will probably offset it.

“Controls” in 1947
Under the terms of the Defence (Tran-
sitional Provisions) Act 61 National
Security Regulations will be continued
until the end of 1947, after which some
will presumably be dropped, while others
it is obviously intended to carry forward
for at least a further year. Among the
latter are the price-control powers.
In an explanatory appendix to his
speech during the second reading m the
bill in the House Dr. Evatt said: There
is general agreement that price-control
must continue for some time to come. At
the August, 1946, Premiers’ Conference it
was agreed that the States would enact
necessary complementary legislation. The
Tasmanian Legislative Council has been
a partial obstacle to completion of these
arrangements, but the control is going on.
As to capital-issues control, Dr. Evatt
quoted a decision made at the Premiers
Conference:
There was general agreement that the
control of capital issues should .continue
for at least three years and that it must
be applicable to all States if it was to
be made effective. It was decided that the
Commonwealth should pass appropriate
legislation relying at the outset on its de-
fence powers, but eventually on State action
applying the Commonwealth law in each
State individually. The control should
apply not only to issues of capital but also
to mortgages and interest rates generally.
Some relaxations have been made in the
control, it was explained. Companies
may now be formed with a capital of
£lO,OOO or less without Treasury approval,
and likewise existing capitals may be in-
creased by £lO,OOO in any one year.
Mortgages up to £l5OO and at a rate of
4\ p.c. or less on first-class securities are
also permitted. But “the biggest relaxa-
tion,” said Dr, Evatt, “is probably in the
general policy of the Treasury, which
adapts itself to the general economic con-
ditions existing from month to month.”
The Economic Organisation Regula-
tions introduced in February, 1942, are
continued so far as they affect controls
over the sale and price of land and houses,
over interest rates and over wage-pegging.
But the wage-pegging regulations, the
Attorney-General points out, have already
been amended to enable the Arbitration
Court to deal with the question of
standard hours and the basic wage, and
further amendments are under considera-
tion. “Wage-pegging” is still regarded by
the Government as a corollary to price-
control.
The principle that females employed in
“vital industries” should be paid 75 p.c.
of the male ralfe is to be continued
during 1947.
Regulations dealing with New Guinea
and Papua are being extended. It was
explained that these regulations protected
the “leave, salary, superannuation and
other rights” of the suspended Adminis-
tration. Further,
They also ensure the continuity of the
laws of the Territories and provide author-
ity for the erection and functioning of the
Australia-New Guinea Production Control
Board, which promotes and controls the pro-
duction of copra, rubber and other primary
products in the Territory and any industry
therein, and arranges for the purchase and
transport of all products of the Territory
with a view to securing maximum supply.
Many residents of the Territories will
say that if what is happening there ist a
fair sample of what the other 60 retained
regulations are upholding, then the lot
had better be swept off the Statute Book.
But what is going on in New Guinea and
Papua is not paralleled in every other
department, even if there is widespread
cause for complaint generally about the
post-war bureaucracy. Eddie Ward is
the master-mind behind the mess in the
Territories. Dr. Evatt is indefinite as to how
long the present set-up will continue:
At present the Territories of Papua and
New Guinea' are jointly administered by
the Provisional Administration established
under the Papua-New Guinea Provisional
Administration Act, 1945. This Adminis-
tration, as its title implies, is temporary-
only, and until the permanent form of
administration is determined, it will be
necessary to retain the External Territories
Regulations.
The Commonwealth Government has
made an awful hash. of its coastal-
shipping activities: according to official
figures there was a debit of £3,107,393 in
the requisitioned-ships section last year,
with an estimate of £1,086,590 for this.
But no end to this sort of thing is in
sight. According to Dr. Evatt;
The regulations give authority for the
establishment, among other things, of the
Australian Shipping Board and the
Stevedoring Industry Commission, and
under the latter the various waterside em-
ployment committees. [The Stevedoring
Industry Commission cost the community
£120,689 last year, and is down for £136,540
this.]
The Government proposes to introduce
a bill covering the establishment of a Steve-
doring Industry Commission for the peace-
time control of the waterside industry.
Until the legislation is enacted the con-
tinuance of the relevant section of the
present regulations is necessary.
In view of the shipping position around
the coast the provisions regarding the re-
quisitioning of ships and the establishment
of the Australian Shipping Board must also
be retained. At a suitable time legisla-
tion proposing the establishment of a per-
manent Commonwealth shipping authority
will be introduced, replacing this section of
the regulations.
A group of regulations dealing with
marketing schemes to be continued deal
with apples and pears, barley, tobacco
leaf, dairy produce, eggs, 'food control,
potatoes and “wheat stabilisation.” Rea-
sons for these controls vary from prob-
able surpluses in the case of apples and
pears to shortages in the case of butter,
from the necessity of supplying Britain
and the 8.C.0.F. in Japan to holding
down prices to the Commonwealth pro-
ducer and costs to the consumer.
Rationing regulations are being con-
tinued. In some cases' the object is to
spread the scanty supply of imported
articles over the population ; in others
the aim is to reduce local consumption
in order to maintain exports to countries
worse off than ourselves.
Among regulations which will lapse
on December 31 are those relating to
Treasury control of Stock Exchange
prices, censorship, power of State
Premiers to control sale of liquor,
marine war-risks insurance, coal control
and timber control (so far as they have
been in the hands of the Commonwealth).
“Apart from the post office, civil avia-
tion and the Territories,” new “works”
and buildings being undertaken by the
Commonwealth Government this financial
year involve an estimated outlay of over
£lO million. Largest expenditure is to be
on war-service homes and shipbuilding;
but £750',000 is provided for “surveys
and other preliminary work in connection
with the standardisation of rail gauges.”
Keeping Eddie Ward quiet is costing
the Commonwealth a lot of money.
And even then the P.M. got beaten on
the Bretton Woods vote,

Active pay and allowances for members
of the forces was £l3O million in 1945-46,
to which deferred pay added £72 million.
This year the figures are estimated at £25
million and £l7 million respectively.
These amounts presumably include pay
to the Japanese occupation forces, appar-
ently left out of the Statistician’s estimate
of pay and allowances for 1945-46 in
computing the national income—the total
for this purpose was £156 million. It is
aimed to reduce the strength of the fight-
ing services to 67,000 by June, 1947 (the
figure was 76,100 on November 30). The
Prime Minister has commented: “It will
take some time for the full effects of
scientific developments in the defence
field to be assessed and for the future
strength and arming of thg services to be
determined.”

As Australia gradually emerges from a
controlled economy it will be enlightening
to see which businesses stand up to com-
petition after so many years of assured
markets and subsidised costs. There is
bound to be a shaking-out, with share-
market reactions. It will also be interest-
ing to observe to what use a number of
war-time civil servants put their fortui-
tously acquired knowledge upon return
to civil life. Often employees of the in-
come-tax departments have found it
profitable to resign and set up business
on the other side of the fence as advisers
to the taxpayer. During the recent war
many businesses have been compelled to
provide trading information to Govern-
ment departments previously kept highly
secret. Some of these departments, “divi-
sions” or “branches” are now contracting
or folding-up, and many of their staff will
find their way back to private employ-
ment. The war has altered the prospects
of many industries and individuals; the
association with the United States,
through lend-lease operations, the inter-
change of officials and the establishment
in Australia of large military forces, is
bound to influence Australia’s post-war
external trading arrangements. There has
been keen activity over the past couple
of years in the acquisition of Australian
agencies for U.S. and British goods.

Wool is now leaving Australia more
freely, notwithstanding surplus stocks
established in the United ' States and
Britain. During the three months July-
September the following quantities went
to the countries named:
United Kingdom, 199,740 bales; Canada,
6011; India, 1570; Belgium, 92,778; Den-
mark, 9126; France, 169,064; Italy,
104,578; Mexico, 1135; Spain, 8950;
Sweden, 18,227; Turkey, 9,227; U.S.A.,
358,382; other countries, 3862.
Doubts about currency stability is
prompting heavy purchases by some
European countries ; in any case, France,
Italy and Belgium apparently find a ready
market for all their woollen manufac-
tures. And, although the price of the
staple has risen since the war, it is still
not excessive by pre - depression
standards. In 1923-24 and 1924-25
average wool prices were considerably
higher than they are at present, and in
1927-28 they approximated prevailing
levels. In 1936-37, too, quotes were close
to current prices. Costs of many other
things (rubber one exception) have
soared meantime.


ABORIGNALITIES
“Old-timer”: Coming up from the river
with a 71b. cod hanging from his wrist,
old Sam had to jump off the road as a
big sedan whirled by. He was still curs-
ing his way out of its dust when it
stopped, turned and came back, A hearty
chap in the driver’s seat hailed him,
“Hey, how much for the fish?” Sam
cogitated, then replied, “Half a quid.”
The hearty chap snorted, then queried,
“Where did you get him?” Sam waved
a negligent hand. “Out o’ the river,” he
said, vaguely. The car bumped off the
road into the shade, the driver and his
passenger got out, accoutred themselves
with flash rods and made for the river.
Sam wrapped his fish in cool .gum leaves,
sat in 4 the shade and waited. Half an
hour drifted by. Then the pair came up
from the river, without fish. They spotted
Sam. “Hey, do y’ want to sell that fish?”
“Yair.” “How much?” “Fifteen-bob,
now.” Another snort and a move to the
car. Then the hearty cove came back.
“Look, be a sport, you can catch plenty
more. No cod’s worth fifteen-bob,” Sam
smiled. “This here fish,” he said, amiably,
“is worth five-bob. There’s another five
for scarin’ the tripe out o’ me with y’r
car an’ another five for makin’ me wait.”
There was a silence, each gazed stead-
fastly at the other. Then the stranger
fished a half-note out and said, “Here,
take ten-bob an’ I’ll apologise for making
you wait.” Sam made it a deal.

“X.E.D.”: The long, sawny cove in
his early forties was vigorously attacking
the twining blackberries alopg the fence
with a slasher as we drew level, and he
paused to wipe the back of a hand across
his moist forehead and cast a speculative
eye over the big mob of woollies.
“Murphy was lucky with sheep, too,” he
commented without preamble. “In fack,
that’s ’ow ’e got ’is start. Bought a big
mob o’ starvers at a bob a head an’ kept
’em alive till the drought broke. Cleared
over a thousand quid an’ went in f’r
dairyin’ in a big way on the farm ’ere.
Mean an’ dam’ lucky, that’s wot
’e was. Made a pile an’ died of
a strained ’eart.” A 14-stone female
strode on to the verandah of the
house near by, made passes in the air and
screamed something unintelligible. De-
fiantly the lanky bloke concluded his tale.
“Never ’ad no luck like Murphy,” he
said. “Got a job on the place ’ere soon
after ’e died an’ married the widder.
That’s ’er on the v’randah.” (Then he
flew at the ’berries like a tornado.

“J. Dale”: We were cane-cutting out
from Mackay (Q.), and were bothered
by crows taking our crib. The mate had
the idea that anything garish and noisy
would scare them, so he took out a big
alarm-clock, with a tick like a black-
smith’s striker, and put it beside the
tucker. As we worked we saw the crows
come in and sheer off, and the mate was
mighty pleased with his notion —until he
went for the crib and found a big brown
snake coiled around both it and the clock.
* * * *
“Mat’s Mate”: “There goes the end of
blokes like you an’ me,” Mat said,
dreamily, as we lay on our backs and
watched a mail plane flying southward.
“Aw, I dunno,” I answered. “They’ll
still have t’ have fences an’ dams t’ sink
an’ sheep t’ shear.” Mat sat up and
chewed on his bit of gum-tree. “It ain’t
that,” he said. “It’s gettin’ about. Y’
got t’ have money t’ travel in them things.
“So you think you can get fresh because I'm muzzled!"
so how can a bloke cut out a contract,
get his cheque an’ go on the bust till he’s
broke? Like it is now y’ can hear o’
some contract a hundred mile away an’
start hittin’ the road to it, pretty sure
you’ll get a lift or be able t’ jump the
rattler most o’ the way. But I can’t see
one o’ them things stoppin’t’ pick up a
couple of snoozers staggerin’ along under
their swags an’ howinell could y’ jump
one? An’ even if y’ did an’ the ticket-
collector missed y’, howinell could y’
jump out again when y’ reckoned y’ was
close t’ where y’ was makin’ for?” I
pondered the passing of our era, trying
to see some way round the inevitable,
then, feeling the two-bob in my pocket,
said, “Well, the pubs ain’t started flyin’
yet.” And in a grave silence we headed
across the road.

“Dusty Gully”: To make good scores
in outback cricket the batsman must on
no account allow the ball to rap against
his pads. My first experience of bush
umpires was to see old Dick’s finger go
up after I failed to turn one away a foot
outside the leg stump. To my question-
ing glance he replied belligerently “Y’re
out leg-before, son. Hit y’ on the pad,
didn’t it? Ain’t no use y’ playin’ ’ere if
y’ don’t unnerstand the rules o’ the
game.”

“O’Took”: While people down south
are crowding to the beaches for their
share of blisters and dumpers, here in
Darwin swimmers are packing away their
costumes till after the “wet.” The water
is more than blood-warm —a satisfactory
explanation of which, incidentally, I have
never heard. The air temperature doesn’t
vary enough to account for the rise in
water temperature, and I can only con-
clude that the high moisture content of
the aSr prevents normal evaporation,
which in' the dry season would produce
a cooling effect similar to the Cool-
gardie-safe principle. Anyway, from
November to March the water at Mendil
and Casuarina beaches is too hot for
pleasant swimming. However, that’s the
least of troubles. Even if you enjoy
splashing about in the steaming briny
there is still a collection of anti-personnel
sea-wogs to be contented with. The
Portuguese man-of-war rates as No. 1
public enemy; his offsider the sea-wasp
has been responsible for a number of
deaths, but fortunately doesn’t come
round in large numbers. Estuarine crocs
are usually well in evidence, also just as
a final hazard.

“Alpine Willie”; Struck a wizened little
cove searching the trees of a gully where
a pair of black cockatoos had been
around for weeks. After judicious inter-
rogation he informed me he was hunting
for their nest. “There’s fifty quid re-
ward,” he said. But he wouldn’t —or
couldn’t —tell me who the donor was.
I’d heard the myth before in the Whit-
field Ranges (Vic.) and from a Gipps-
land cocky.

“C.E.”; Ted overtook Hudson just out
of town, and the pair rode on together
till they reached the latter’s gate, “Better
come in an’ have a drink o’ tea, Ted,”
invited Hudson. “The missus is just
takin’ one out to the verandah.” They
swung off, and Hudson’s freed nag im-
mediately made for the windmill tank
that was spilling a steady stream from
its overflow. With his mouth underneath
the nag gulped and splashed enjoy ably.
“Yair, the silly cow always drinks there,”
explained Hudson, turning at Ted’s
chuckle. “There’s plenty of water in
the trough, but he won’t have it if he
can get to that overflow. He’s bad as
me flamin’ mong. Tige streaks for that
hole above the shed soon as he gets
home, an’ if y’ give him a drink in a
bucket he wouldn’t have it. Sit down,
Ted.” He indicated an old chair. “Couple
more cups. Mum. Yair, animals is
funny like that,” he continued. “Have
their own special fads. Water is just the
same anywhere else, o’ course, but I’m
hanged if y’ can make ’em see it. Pig-
headed, that’s what.” He stopped to
. take the tea handed to him. “Aw, cripes,
Mum, ain’t we got another decent cup?”
came his protest. “Y’ know I hate them
glass things. The tea tastes awful out
of them !”

“Fang”: Tiger snakes along the
Murray, found mostly where shallow
lakes, lagoons and swamps abound, are
of average length and are often
referred to as swamp tigers. The body
is stumpy, the head broad and ugly, and
the flattened neck of an enraged speci-
men adds to the vicious appearance,
which doesn’t belie the tiger’s temper
when fully aroused. Color ranges from
straw to almost black, and the telltale
bands may be very distinct or hardly
discernible. In mountain country I’ve
seen numerous tiger snakes well over
five feet and found them ready to attack
anything that shows signs of molesting
them. Other snakes will strike as a last
resort in self-defence, but the tiger when
cornered fights like a fury. There have
been cases where the victim has been
struck repeatedly by one. The strike is
frequently made with a sideways lunge,
and, though the mouth 'formation makes
it rarely able to embed more than one
fang in a target such as a man’s leg, the
snake may hang on and worry the flesh
until dislodged.

“Chuck”: Sandy put the paper aside as
Ned walked in and stood blinking in the
light. “Silly darned craze they’ve got
nowadays, making noises like something
else,” he remarked. “Blokes imitating
dogs and things, and dogs imitating
blokes.” “Like that city cove y’ got
stoppin’ here?” murmured Ned. “Yair,
like Sam’s boy,” Sandy agreed. “Calls
himself a mimic, and came up to learn
a few more calls.” “Where she now.
“Up the hill listening to a mopoke,
snorted Sandy. “Always trying to P u
those noises over me; as thougn I
wouldn’t know the diff’rence. You II
hear him coming d’rec’ly.” Ten minutes
later, a fox bark challenged from outside.
“Told y’,” Sandy growled, as the noise
drew closer. Ned turned an ear. Am t
bad, neither,” he grinned. “Ever hear a
fox finish on a note like that? smiled
the old bloke. “Anyway, it ain’t near
husky enough.” Presently, the visitor
came in. “Thought I heard a fox, he
remarked, glancing across at Sandy.
“Think your fat gobblers are safe?
Sandy’s snort left no doubt of the matter,
until going out half an hour later he dis-
covered the gobblers scattered round the
yard their heads bitten off.

“Em G.”: Those regular corrugations
on outback gravel roads (B. 27 /11 / ’46)
are caused by the roller —steam or other-
wise—when the road is first made. The
roller pushes a .small heap of gravel be-
fore it and then rides over the heap,
packing it in hard and level. The result
is that the smooth surface of the finished
road really consists of a series of hard
ridges with loose strips between. Fast
motor - traffic causes vibrations which
loosen and then gouge out the loose
gravel between the hard ridges. Wind
and rain finish the job and the regular
corrugations result.

“Esk D.”: Harry and Big Joe,
fossicking at Lone Gully, had a shaft
down 20 feet on a promising bit
of stuff, when they tapped a flow
of water. Bailing was required con-
sistently to keep the workings clear,
and at that rate little progress was to be
made. An ingenious pair, they set out
to devise a means of dewatering the show
in place of the pumping gear they
couldn’t afford to buy. They scrounged
pieces of piping, iron scrap, a rusted
l|in. pump and the wheels, pulleys and
axles from a discarded harvester. A
month later I was called into consultation.
They had a small Pelton wheel rigged
on the slope below the shaft, and to it
as the driving medium ran miscellaneous
piping to carry the pumped water from
the head of the shaft. In return a trans-
mission was rigged to drive the pump
from the waterwheel. “Y’ see how it
works?” Harry asked, “All we have t’
do is spin the wheel till the pump gets
going t’ fill the pipes an’ she’ll keep
going indefinitely. Now, how d’y’ reckon
we c’d fit a guv’nor so she won’t pump
too fast f’r the water runnin’ into the
shaft? We don’t want t’ lose workin’
time through gittin’ airlocks in the pipes.”

“Makdee”: “Aerogenes” (B.
23/10/’46) and “Bufo” correctly point
out Bakewell’s influence on breeding, but
he had a good farm to start with and
plenty of capital to keep him going while
the work went on. Commend me to Mr.
and Mrs. Tulley of Yorkshire. They
earned a pound a week between them
about a century ago, and they kept a
pig. They stinted themselves to feed him,
they took him walks and they even
scratched his back as necessity arose.
From their pig all the Large Whites in
the world are descended. There’s no
pig so important anywhere in the world
as the Large White. His one defect is
that in hot climates he gets sunburnt.
Don’t blame the Tulleys for that. They’d
never have found it out in Yorkshire.
» * * *
“Gravelsnatcher”: From where I sit I
can see, all growing within a circle of
20yds. radius, a jarrah, a red-gum and a
banksia, apart from numerous shrubs.
Their roots must be intermingling, fight-
ing for the same minerals, absorbing them
and driving the sap up into their branches.
By what process, then, are those same
foods converted into such vastly different
timbers as jarrah and banksia? In the
process of photosynthesis, possibly, but
even then they are all subjected to the
same rays of the same sun. Maybe
there’s a possibility that the different trees
seek slightly different minerals. As if to
discount that thought my gaze shifted
to the orchard, where plums, peaches,
nectarines and apricots are growing and
producing fruit from the stock —and roots
—of the same tree, foreign to all of them.
From one tree, product of a keen
grafter, I can pick peaches, apricots
and nectarines. Here, obviously, the
same ingredients go to the making of
different fruit, leaves and branches, and,
conceivably, they are in the same propor-
tions. An analogy to this exists in the
mineral world, where diamonds and coal
contain the same ingredients in the same
proportion, but here a purely physical
agency has wrought the change. What
fine intelligence exists in leaves that they
have taken a group of chemicals and,
by their subtle alchemy, wrought them
unfailingly to their individual desires?,
BOTTLES AND TINS.
I had a dream in the night which I
Attribute to steak-and-kidney pie—
A doubtful dish that the cavemen ne’er
Added, ’tis held, to their bills-of-fare;
But nonetheless on its midnight theme
This dream of mine was a caveman’s dream:
I saw mankind like a row of pins
Encircled round by Bottles and Tins.
Tins and bottles, bottles and tins.
They enter the scene when life begins,
Usher us in and escort us out,
From birth to death, we are hedged about
By tins and bottles, bottles and tins.
That old Stone Age was a spacious time
When cave art flourished, and oral rhyme
Joyfully danced on it's naked feet;
Those hairy hands—after auroch meat,
And marrow fat of the elk and deer —
Delivered' the tribal message clear;
The artists, dressed in their tiger skins.
Were not constrained by bottles and tins,
Tins and bottles, bottles and tins—
Their brows o’erhung, they had lanky shins,
But no cave galleries have been found
With outlines dull, in the square or round.
Of tins and bottles, bottles and tins.
Cro-Magnon pictures were always free
Of rot and surrealist duddery.
A reindeer never in line appeared
As something else, with a purple, beard —
A lesson to those who would fain depart
From rules laid down by primitive Art,
And held in practice, until begins
An era crazed by bottles and tins,
Tins and bottles, bottles and tins.
The Artist wise from his cavern grins;
Our “March of Progress,” he would advance,
Is naught but a wild Walpurgis dance
Of tins and bottles, bottles and tins.
Good elephant-steak and mammoth-stew
Appear no more on a bard’s menu;
But bottled sauces and canned preserves
Destroy his stomach and wreck his nerves,
And now we open another page— .
Synthetic foods in an Atom Age;
We’ll eat in cafes and drink at inns
And make the source of our vitamins
Tins and bottles, bottles and tins.
In household cupboards and grocers’ bins
The coming age like this age of steel
Will be an era, we sadly feel,
Of tins q,nd bottles, bottles and tins.
Study the relics and seek the myths
Of those fine artists the Paleoliths!
Study the records of Greece and Rome,
And these queer questions at once come home —■
When rhino, chops were partaken, rare,
From the caverns’ coals, was Art not there?
When wine was sipped from a leathern bag
In the age of bronze did culture lag?
Were Homer’s liquids contained in bins?
Or Virgil’s suppers prepared from tins?
Tins and bottles, bottles and tins —
And are we not in our silly sins
Punished today by a thousand ills
Because the spirit no yearning fills
From tins and bottles, bottles and tins?
And so at my Vision’s ending I
Beheld o’er the landscape, near and bye,
A final raffle, alas! alas!
Of rusty tinplate and broken glass.
In jungles wild and in fields o’ergrown
The birds and animals held their Own.
The fish still swam in the salty seas,
And flowers called to the honey bees;
But man, his cities, his homes, his inns
Had left no trace save bottles and tins,
Tins and bottles, bottles and tins —
Departed, gone from a world that' spins
In its ordered course the sun around,
His epitaph writ in mound on mound
Of tins and bottles, bottles and tins!
VICTORIA.

“Wippegong”: My youngster assures
me, on the authority of a tuppenny
journal he favors, that hunters approach-
ing wild elephants can hear the rumblings
of their digestive organs before
the herd is sighted. At that corner of
Sydney’s Taronga Park where the little
train yelps its way round a circular track
while the merry-go-round performs at the
top of its voice and the radio blares the
races over all, the elephant plodding
placidly around with his load of nippers
seems the only being which has no part
in the din. I have never suspected that
the hideous row is partly caused by
the gurgles of Jumbo’s gut.

“Bray Rock”; “Niloc” (B. 27/11/’46)
needs a trip to Tasmania to become
acquainted with really effective methods
of catching barracoota. The hardy Fly-
speck professional uses a jig, which,
being interpreted, is a stoutish pole, six
or seven feet long, with a couple of feet
of light wire rope on one end bearing
a stout unbarbed hook and a tin or
wooden imitation of a small fish. Drift-
ing down with stopped engine on to the
flurry of broken water and leaping fish
which denotes the presence of hungry
’coota, the jig is waggled about on the
surface from the boat’s stern. As the
sea-tigers snap at the lure the fisherman
heaves them up with the pole and flicks
them off into a tarpaulin, or the bunt of
the lowered mains’l if no tarp. is carried.
When the shoal sounds, another lot is
looked for, and the performance re-
peated until they have a load.

“Bo”: Sawny Jack spent most of what
spare time he had “inventin’.” The only
thing that had saved him from being in-
continently fired after he had put a bullet
through the house tank prior to proving
his new self-sealing device and about a
thousand gallons of precious water had
run away was that Hudspeth knew he
had no possible chance of getting another
hand. One morning the townward-
bound boss told Jack to get a start
on the replacement of the old ter-
mite-rotten western boundary fence,
which was about half a mile from
the house. When Hudspeth returned
about an hour before lunch-time
"No more gangster literature for you”
and ran the utility into the shed he
saw Jack down on his knees, busy with a
length of tie-wire. “Y’re back from the
fencin’ a bit early, aren’t y’?” asked the
trump. Jack stood up.. “I’m just goin’
now. There y’ are!”—he pointed proudly
to his handiwork—“whaddaya think of
it?” Hudspeth looked down. Through
a wheel—obviously from the wheel-
barrow—Jack had threaded the strainer
roller. To each end of this he had lashed
a fencing bar to form the sides. A short
sapling kept these approximately parallel,
and the rectangle thus formed he had
laced with fencing-wire. On his frame-
work, he had laboriously lashed with tie-
wire the various other implements to do
the job. “Have you bin on that all the
mornin’?” roared the boss. “’Course I
have! ” said Jack. “Y* don’t think a man
can make a legless wheelbarrer —the first,
I bet, that’s ever been made—-in a few
minutes. All I gotter do now is wheel it
across to the job.” “But, y’ stupid
blankard,” said Hudspeth, “why couldn’t
y’ have harnessed Bob into the cart an’
chucked the stuff into that?” Jack looked
at his boss almost in pity. “Would
Edison,” he asked scornfully, “have ever
invented the gramophone by muckin’
around harnessin’ up a nag?”

“M.R.”: My old sheep-hound Jack was
a silent worker (B. 27 /11 / ’46) who
couldn’t be induced to bark in any
circumstances whilst working sheep. But
he had his own method of dealing with
challenging crossbreds or stubborn old
merino ewes. When they refused to turn
he bared his teeth, shot straight at the
offender as though to devour it at one
bite and then, turning his head at the
point of contact, hit it with his shoulder.
Not even rams would stand up to that.
* * * *
“Plop”: The town’s rubbish-heap
being deemed an eyesore to tourists, the
council gave us the job of covering it
over. While we hoed into our tucker at
lunch-time a billygoat, dragging a length
of rope, approached and looked with
horror on what was happening to his
fodder supply. A corned-beef-and-pickle
sandwich did little to allay his indigna-
tion. He bounced over to his claim to
down as much as possible before we put
an end to his pantry. For his first course
he selected an ancient pair of corsets,
following up with a treacle-tin. After
eyeing a couple of light bulbs with an
eye full of dubiety as to their digesti-
bility, he spotted the end of his rope,
trailed by his foraging around a stump.
Chewing it daintily, he gobbled it along
its length, discovering finally that the
unconsumed foot or so was attached
securely to his own throat. By sitting on
his stern and shaking his beard in wonder
he completed the picture, and we would
have all suffered ruptured diaphragms
had not the foreman sliced the rope. Billy
finished it with a gulp. When last seen
he was gazing meditatively at a coil of
barbed-wire.

“Golden Mile”: X appreciate “Colonel
Bungstarter’s” description of bar-break-
ing in early Kalgoorlie (B. 20/11/’46) ex-
cept in one particular: his speaking of
the arrival of the police. In my experi-
ence they never arrived, though hair
and teeth and beer and blue murder apd
blanky hell tore the atmosphere. I admit,
though, that my habitat was more around
the Dirty Acre and, later, Boulder than
around the semi-civilised Hannans.

“Herbert Dawson”: Roy, riding
through his netted sheep-country, found
a bewildered individual wearily walking
along carrying a kerosene-tin bucket in
which was a billy-can of water. Recog-
nising the wanderer as a recently-
appointed employee of Ted, his neighbor,
he elicited that the lad was bushed ; he
had been ringbarking almost in sight of
his employer’s house, and, finding the
netting fence instead of his way home, he
had climbed over—for what reason or
purpose he was unable to say. Realising
he had on his hands a person with really
remarkable capabilities for getting and
remaining bushed, Roy wrestled with the
problem of directing him. Then he re-
membered the telephone line. Taking the
lost one to where the single line led from
tree to tree through the green forest
country, Roy gave him foolproof direc-
tions concluding: “That line leads<cight
into Ted’s.house. Keep looking up to
make sure it is still overhead, but don’t
leave it!” Roy had just reached home
when a dreadful recollection brought him
up standing. Ted had mentioned a day
or two earlier his intention to set a spring
gun on a cattle-pad which a dingo was
“runqing,” and which crossed the tele-
phone line about two miles from the
boundary netting. He raced to the
’phone. Ted answered it, took in the
situation and within a few seconds was
sprinting for the saddled horse tied up in
the shade. He had got to within a few
hundred yards of the spring gun when the
“Civush y'r hand an' I'll pull yez out!”
explosion came. Racing on, he came
on a white - faced figure standing as
though paralysed about fifty yards away
from “the spot marked X.” In its right
hand it still held the handle of the kero-
sene-tin bucket. The bucket and the
billy-can of water had gone, leaving no
trace, but they had saved their owner’s
legs. The youth went back to town
when mail-day came round. He told
the mailman that he “couldn’t quite take
to the bush.”
* * * *
“Zake”: The ovine family is not exactly
renowned for the quality of its intelli-
gence—the ewe’s uncanny ability to re-
cognise her own offspring from among
a paddockful of lambs, all to the human
eye exactly alike, is a matter of blind
instinct —but one old ram I came upon
certainly displayed a capacity for orderly
thinking, He was viewing with an avid
eye a clump of bamboos, the tender
green tips of which waved some 12ft.
aloft. For a few minutes he recon-
noitred the clump, speculated, then
finally selected a branch that went up at
an angle of about 40 degrees. Then he
got astride its base, his weight bending it
down, after which he proceeded to walk
along it, keeping the branch under his
belly until he reached the tips.
* * * ♦
“Aperist”: To the uninitiated, vividly
sting-conscious, the sight of the bee-
master handling his hives smacks almost
of the magical. With no more protec-
tion than a veil, as often as not worn up
on the hat-brim, the apiarist, after a few
puffs of smoke to the opening of the hive,
will tear it to pieces, dragging out frame
after frame, each black with bees, cutting
out comb, nipping off precious queen
cells, all without receiving a sting. Thrust-
ing the bare hand and arm right down to
the floor of a crowded hive counts-, as
nothing. Even when bees land on his face
he remains unalarmed. As for the catch-
ing of a swarm, ray own crude method
is simply to hold a big cardboard box
underneath, give the swarm a shake —the
whole mass rattles down like so many
peas—and after that to toss a bag over
the box, pick it up and walk home. To
house such a boxful, have the new hive
half-filled with frames and open at the
top —just pour your bees in and again
cover with the bag. With never a sting,
for bees don’t sting a person who treats
them as casually as that. They seem to
realise that their master has an affection
for them and they respond accordingly.
♦ * * *
“B. A. Ker”: It’s true that some dogs
rely almost entirely on the sense of sight
(B. 27/11/’46), just as it is true that
the hound species generally trust im-
plicitly in its sense of smell (I’ve seen
a beagle follow a scent to within a foot
of a squatting rabbit); yet I doubt if
either sense conveys as much to the ani-
mal intelligence as the sense of hearing.
It is this sense that enables a dog or
horse to know that a certain sound means
him, and others that he must go or
stop, chase a beast or return im-
mediately. A well-meaning chap of my
acquaintance used to pour kerosene on
his dog’s back with the idea of killing
fleas. He didn’t realise that the fluid was
causing more torment than the parasites
until somebody drew his attention to the
furtive exit of the dog when he heard the
kerosene-tin being moved. The fowl could
scarcely be graded among the more in-
telligent creatures, but it can associate
sounds with subsequent events. Watch
the way the chocks come streaking in
from the bush when the cry of “Chook,
chook - chook - chook” heralds feeding
time. And though I’ve many times cursed
the moronic mentality that impels the
stupid creatures to rush past a wide-open
door and frantically try to get in through
a two-inch mesh, I marvel that the
sound of the lid falling on the wheat-bin
(which is in a shed out of sight) brings
the whole troop flocking to the wire in
anticipation of the evening meal.
* * * ♦
“Also Ran”: In stigmatising Eyre’s and
Kennedy’s native assistants as Quislings,
“Biro” (B. 27 /11 / ’46) starts with the
fallacious assumption that all Australian
aborigines were combined in a united re-
sistance against the white invader when,
actually, they were in separate tribal and
language groups which were often at war
with each other. In any case, modern
nationalistic loyalties cannot be applied
to primitive people. By “Biro’s” brand of
logic, De Gaulle is an arch-Quisling in
that he, a European, allied himself with
the Americans, who were invading
Europe, where they were resisted by
European, i.e., German, forces.
* * * *
“D.R.H.”: When the mail buggy made
its weekly stop at our gate a few days
ago the driver delivered, unwittingly, a
few living animals at the end of their
300-mile trip in a parcel of plants. The
one I have before me is an interesting
chap. He’s enterprising and active with-
out being unduly speedy; he proceeds
carefully feeling his way, and look-
ing ahead with a pair of eyes that he can
pull into and push out from his head as
one pulls out the finger of a glove. A
canny bird, he carries his water supply
in the folds of his own skin, and, so that
he may not suffer stone bruises, is
equipped with a complete road-making
plant. Between his starboard eye and
his collar he has separate openings for
reproduction, breathing and elimination,
while right for’ard are apertures for
feeding and for the production of his
prefabricated road. The feeding slit is
important—the poor blighter has to find
employment for anything up to 15,000
teeth. Although I’ve referred to him as
“he” the beggar is actually both he and
she. As a male he’s a bold and success-
ful wooer, but rather unorthodox in that
he uses artillery to rouse his intended
mate to the desired emotional state—even
Hollywood hasn’t thought of a hero who
shoots a limestone dart at his beloved ;
while as a mother he naturally lays eggs
in the usual way. Apparently, too, he has
no faith in pre-election promises, for he
has built, carries round and lives in his
own house. His peculiar brand of archi-
tecture, however, has compelled him to
alter his innards to fit his mansion and
he has, as a consequence, only one kidney.
However, as garden snails are not con-
siderable meat-eaters, one kidney is
apparently enough—the missus says it’ll
be one too many if the creature gets into
her garden.
CHRISTMAS HOLIDAY.
Little tracks that bend and turn,
Little tracks that wind and weave
Through the Christmas-bush and fern
Little songs for Christmas Eve.
While the great gums, rustling
With a long unbroken rhyme,
From their burning censers swing
All the scents of summer time.
From my own place in the sun
I see earth and heaven blend;
Range and ridge and valley run
Onward to a lost world’s end.
Down the blue infinity
Morning tide till evening song
I could look and look and be
Drunk with distance all day long.
Sun, go slowly down the sky;
Stars, come late to spangle space;
Of this little hour I
Must not miss one moment’s grace.
Must not waste the slightest part
Of the yet unbroken whole:
Twelve months toil to break my heart —
Seven days’ grace to save my soul.
VICTORIA.

"DON'T WORRY, I'M SENDING IT TO
GRAZCOS."
Gundagai Lambs.
“Pat O’Day”: The Southdown-Romney
or Downs-Border Leicester fat lamb suits
the south-western N.S.W. slopes, with
their fairly high rainfall (up to 25in.) and
reasonable summer climate (altitude of
Gundagai is 738 ft.), though good results
are obtained from the Dorset breed, the
type having a large frame and very early
maturing.
The Downs-Border Leicester is as near
the perfect fat lamb as the breeder would
wish for, because if a bad season happens
along and there is an absence of that
bloom necessary to make the lamb sale-
able at four months at Flemington—the
B.L. strain can be depended upon as a
good carry-over lamb—its saleable value
will increase with the growth of frame,
instead of decrease as does the purer
Downs lamb after it is shorn.
Looking through a very big yarding of
lambs at Flemington recently, and notihg
the characteristics that put high value
on certain pens (the 361 b. dressed-weight
class easily weighed from 801 b. to 901 b.
live weight), the attractiveness of the
Border strain was obvious. Many of
them were from Tumut (s.-w. slopes) and
farther-out districts, and their full vigor
and large-framed, well-fed appearance
set them off against the four-months
sucker lambs which were fat at trucking,
but arrived with a loss of weight. This
shows that the lamb country needs its
own meatworks. Meantime country
selling centres are securing equally
good prices for fat crossbred lambs as
Sydney, because motor transport ensures
that, in most cases, the travelling time
to sales is but a few hours compared
to days by train.
Pasture Improvement.
“Archaps”: If a frost-resistant strain of
stylo can be developed it may revolu-
tionise the nutritive value of Queensland’s
cattle pastures and spread the' cattle-
grazing period over most of the year.
At the Fitzroy Vale (C.Q.) plant station
the C.S.I.R. did splendid work on the de-
velopment of introduced pastures, and
it’s a pity that the end of the war brought
a cessation of the work. The C.S.I.R. has
carried out extensive investigational work
in pasture improvement in winter-rain-
fall areas, and Queensland graziers have
for years been urging that similar work
be done in summer-rainfall areas, but
the only job now in hand is in the sheep
district at Gilruth Plains on Mitchell
grass.
Stylo is fairly, easy to get established
in spear grass and other native pastures,
the normal practice of spring burning
of pastures doing this satisfactorily. C.
W. Winders, Queensland agrostologist,
states that the plant’s free-seeding habit
(yields up to 3001 b. per acre have been
obtained), combined with ready germina-
tion under natural conditions, should en-
. 9
sure its permanency in the pasture with-
out reseeding operations. Stylo has a
high protein content, which at 12 to 15
per cent, is double that of the native
grasses under controlled grazing. While
making vigorous growth, it is relatively
unpalatable to stock, and so it makes a
large bulk for winter feeding, when it is
readily eaten by stock. Even the top
growth remains green and succulent. In
one trial a stand of speargrass alone
yielded slightly over two tons of hay per
acre, but a mixture of speargrass and
stylo yielded over , four tons per acre —
2\ tons of stylo, 11 tons speargrass. The
plant’s main disadvantage is its suscepti-
bility to frost injury.
J. L. Wilson, on his Calliope property
in the Gladstone district, found that stylo
reproduced readily and looked to be the
“If you go past the toolshed, get the spanner."
answer to the cattleman’s dreams so far
as pasture improvement was concerned,
but along came a frost and wiped it out
overnight. Work has begun in the Bris-
bane district with a few plants which
persisted under frost to see if a frost-
resistant strain can be developed. A lot
of legumes will not persist in combina-
tion with rank-growing grasses, and hence
are useless for Queensland coastal cattle
pastures, but stylo grows in association
with speargrass and similar grasses.
A Horse Disease.
“Overange”: “Walkabout” disease
struck heavily at horses in West Kim-
berley (W.A.) last wet season, causing
losses of 50 p.c. and more on some
stations. Nearly 20 years ago the C.S.I.R.
found the trouble to be due to saponin
poisoning caused by whitewood. Stock-
owners, however, were not satisfied, and
certainly vets failed to explain why
some stations which have practically no
whitewood lose horses periodically, while
others which have plenty of whitewood
lose none.
Most men here agree that the trouble
seems to be due to worms, as horses
shot in the final stages and opened show
heavy worm infestation and large per-
forated patches in the wall of the stom-
ach. The worms are minute, a ball of
white slime proving on examination to
be a mass of worms with pink or red
heads. In 1942 I started on a property
which, ten years ago, was notorious for
disease, and have drenched my horses
two or three times a year with a pint
of linseed-oil containing two dessert-
spoons of turpentine. So far I have
lost no horses, though neighbors have
lost heavily.
The turpentine-oil drench is, according
to vets, only 60 p.c. effective, but 1
continue with it rather than use some
more effective modern preparation, be-
cause of the value of the oil. Conviction
of the benefit of the drenching came
from opening a horse which had showed
signs of disease, had been drenched and
had recovered, later to die of congestion
of the lungs caused by overheating. The
stomach, fairly free from worms, showed
large scars where the patches attacked
by worms had apparently healed over.
It may be too early to say that this
routine of drenching is a definite pre-
ventive, but all signs point that way. The
cost is slight, about 4s. per head per
year, the job does not take long, even
allowing for throwing to drench, which
one has to do here, and colts need not
be drenched till broken in. Many vets
are not in favor of drenching because
of the danger of pneumonia caused by
liquid going into the lungs, but with an
experienced drencher the risk is slight.
A Pineapple Patch.
“Sarina”: An acre or two of pine-
apples is an asset on any Queensland
coast farm, and is easily established, A
fairly rich light soil of good depth seems
most suitable, but heavy soils are all
right if well drained. The pineapple
favors acid soil conditions, and Queens-
land Agricultural Department points out
that these conditions may be achieved
by adding sulphur to the land either be-
fore or after planting'the suckers. Sul-
phate of ammonia is one of the best ferti-
lisers for pines ; besides feeding the plants
it prevents the soil from sweetening up
and eliminates the necessity for using
sulphur.
Never buy cheap suckers unless you
know the farm is quite free from disease.
Before planting the suckers strip the
lower leaves off to facilitate rooting.
Don’t plant while the ground is sloppy
after rain; the suckers are capable ot
taking root even under drought condi-
tions.
A Wire Rope.
“Atlanta”: To make one, secure a
jacked-up cart or dray to a tree or dead-
man” post, tying the wire strands to
spokes close to the hub. An anvil or
heavy weight must be fastened to the
opposite ends of the wires. The rope is
made simply by turning the wheel, but
it’s hard work, and if you possess a farm
tractor there’s an easier way.
Rear wheels of the tractor are jacked
up and wires tied to spokes as with the
dray. Eight or nine strands of No. 10
gauge soft wire will produce an unbreak-
able rope, but four or five wires will re-
sist most strains. In suitable ground a
35-tyne cultivator with tynes lowered
makes a good anchor, and will drag up
about five yards in 90 as the rope
tightens. Wires must not be crossed be-
fore they are tied, and they’ll unravel if
the anchor is too light. Running the trac-
tor 10 or 15 minutes should complete the
longest rope required.
Cutting the finished rope from the
wheel can be dangerous unless you stand
on the side to which the wires are wound.
Bind rope ends to prevent unravelling or
fasten them to a steel ring or hook.
Green Manures.
“Plane Creek”: The best three for
Queensland are ‘giant cowpea, velvet bean
and Gambia pea. The first two are well
liked in the far north for holding erod-
able canefields during the December-April
“wet.” Velvet bean is sometimes hard
to control when once established. They
make good green cow feed
and can be ensiled if dressed
with molasses.
Crotalaria is a unique
green-manure in that it may
be mown several times during
its five to six months growing
period. The green stuff has no food
value, but the plant is more drought-
resistant than the general run of green-
manuring plants. The mowing is done
to encourage it to shoot out afresh and
produce a much-increased yield of ver-
dure for ploughing-in.
Ordinary black cowpeas and brown
Poona cowpeas are favored for green
manuring by C.Q, coast cane-farmers.
They have a growing period of three to
four months and are very satisfactory
for the 50 to 70in. rainfall areas. Farmers
are few who allow their lands to starve
for humus and to face erosion when
these legumes can be established on any
scratched-over and harrowed land in
November-December.
Trees from Seeds.
“W. 8.”: I’ve grown many eucalypts
successfully from seed, including the
dwarf sugar-gum. The method is
to put some rubble in the bottom of a
shallow seed-box, fill up with light soil,
water well and level off. Then, any time
from December to January, put the seeds
on top of this and cover them with leaf-
mould. Cover the box with hessian and
water through the hessian. When the

Pelmanism
Scientific Training of Mind , Memory and Personality
H.M. Forces.
Approved by the War Office,
London, and under the Common-
wealth Reconstruction Training
Scheme.
The following are taken from several
similar communications received whilst
this announcement was being prepared.
The writers have got half way or further
through the Pelman Course v Our mail
each day contains many such apprecia-
tive references from service members and
civilians alike.
12th June, 1946.
“My wife advises me that nowadays I
appear to be more affable and in my work
I have noticed that at times I remember
little things which other people have not been
able to recall. This is a definite help, and
I feel that I am improving in all respects
as I progress with the Course.”
12th June, 1946.
“Since I began the Pelman Course I have
found a great improvement in myself gener-
ally. I have acquired the ability to make
decisions and have confidence in those deci-
sions. I have more confidence in myself and
I am more precise in the way I do things.”
24th June, 1946.
“I consider I have benefited greatly and I
intend, on the completion of this Course, and
w;.'n Ice> adverse conditions prevail, to go
completely through the Lessons a second time
and carefully look for points which I may
have missed.”
24th June, 1946.
“My aim was social, moral and financial
gain. Have easily doubled social contacts.
Morally, have made good progress. Have
improved my employment situation and am
earning more than before starting your
Course. The Course is very helpful in my
other studies, even if only because of more
agile brain.”
QUALIFICATIONS: The Quali-
fications the Pelman Institute
looks for in those seeking its help
are:
(a) the ability to read and write
intelligently ;
(b) a sincere desire for self-
improvement ; and
(c) a willingness in the pupil to
co-operate fully with the
Institute in its effort to
develop his aptitudes and
powers quickly and per-
manently.
Speed and Accuracy
The first thing Pelmanism does is to quicken the perceptions so that
we are more intensely aware of what is around us and about us. We
see more and we see it more quickly and accurately. In consequence
there is a great access of confidence in our ability to acquire exact
knowledge, remember it, and recall it as required. W© learn to trust
our sense perception.
The way to development of inherent qualities and aptitudes is then
open and relatively smooth and easy for the normal man and women.
The more important of these qualities are:—
Observation Self-Confidences. Concentration
Will-power Organization Social Ease
Decision Judgment Initiative
and a THOROUGHLY DEPENDABLE MEMORY
for faces, figures, names, appointments, prices and useful data of
©very kind.
The exercises are pleasant, and each has its special purpose. The
Pelnian Course is a real training, its primary objects being to create
good habits of mind and memory in place of careless and slovenly ones,
to train the conscious and the sub-concious so that ©very faculty will,
when called upon, contribute its share in making a good performance of
anything that has to be done.
There are over half a million Pelmanists, of whom more than 60,000
have enrolled with the Institute in Melbourne.
Copies of “The Efficient Mind” are posted free. Inquiries are
regarded as confidential. We have no outside representatives.

The Swarming Season.
“Bumble”: Where spring flows of
nectar and pollen have been copious, the
problem of keeping bees from swarming
may cause serious concern and the
apiarist’s frantic efforts to keep the hives
in full numerical strength might be only
partly successful. Queens from strains
less predisposed to swarming than others
should be used; young queens from the
previous autumn batch are more virile
layers and less likely to lead a swarm
out in the first season.
Plenty of room is required as soon as
the hot weather sets in, and two brood
chambers may be used to advantage at
the height of the brood-rearing season.
If these are alternated every 10 days it
will cut down overcrowding of the brood
combs. The use of all worker combs
from full foundation will practically
eliminate the raising of drones, an over-
plus of which incites swarming. Use one
or two supers over the brood-nests,
according to the strength of colonies and
the quantity of honey being stored.
We’ve had a fair deal of success in
preventing swarming by the use of an
early-spring batch of new queens. Several
populous hives are chosen to be given
stimulative feeding to build them up
satisfactorily to raise queens, and the
cells are cared for in chambers stocked
with brood over queen-excluders to pre-
vent interference. The larvae, grafted in
queen cups, are started in a hive rendered
temporarily queenless. For good queens
there should be ample young bees to give
the larvae proper attention, and stimu-
lative feeding must be continued. For
suitable mating there should be drones
raised in the best colonies.
Hints for the Farm.
“C.A.A.”: When sheep, cattle, horses
or dogs have been poisoned by phos-
phorus in rabbit baits an emetic of
copper sulphate is effective. Chief
symptoms are the onion-like odor of the
breath, thirst, fever and abdominal pain.
Oils, fats and milk must not be given, as
they promote absorption.
“Billjim”: Holding yards should be
paved and well drained to allow them
to be washed down. Wash cow-bails with
caustic-soda solution and sterilise with
chlorine solution. This will kill most of
the germs on walls and floors. Regular
application of chlorine solution dis-
courages flies.
“Pronto”: Experience of all droughts
since and including 1914 has taught me
a method of eking out the fodder ration
for working horses. To a kero.-tin of
chaff I add a couple of handfuls of bran,
and a similar quantity of boiled barley.
To this is added a sprinkling of molasses
and the lot is mixed together. My team
thrives on it.
“W.E.M.R.”: When faced with the job
of fishing a broken pipe or rod out of a
bore, and you don’t know what the size
of the pipe or rod is, put a hole in the
bottom of a jam-tin or billy-can about
the same diameter, thread a long wire or
cord in the hole and secure, fill the tin
with firm clay packed tightly and lower
it, open side down, on to the pipe or rod.
The clay will take a clear impression to
enable you to determine the type of fish-
ing tools required.
“W. Court”: The dry season is the
right time for cleaning up the dry beds
of watercourses. Logs that become
jammed across the main channels collect
floating debris and turn floodwaters over
near-by low banks when the stream is up.
Such logs and also large rocks can often
be put to very good use in strengthening
crumbling banks. Cram soil between ’em,
and plant strong-rooting grasses to bind
the lot together. Giant couch is very
satisfactory for this purpose in the high-
rainfall areas of Queensland and
northern N. S. Wales, and will also yield
a measure of green feed for cattle during
the warmer months.
“Big Billy”: Many dirty, cracked,
broken and heat-affected eggs result from
poor nesting accommodation. Nests
should be arranged inside the pens on the
partition walls and away from the
weather. Place them about two feet from
the ground so that they don’t take up
floor-space. Egg-gathering should be done
several times a day and nests covered to
keep them dark and secluded, making
certain that the cover has sufficient slope
to prevent the birds from roosting on it.
One nest for every six or seven birds.
“Bennie”: Fowls need no end of shell-
grit. Supply plenty of it, and see that it
is not allowed to stand in watertight con-
tainers, particularly in the 'wet season.
Put several holes in the container to pro-
vide good drainage.
“W.E.M.R.”: In that hint (B.
27 /11 / ’46) X suggested heating the three-
cornered file and quenching it to make an
improvised anvil-cutter. This removes
danger of breaking. Have used them for
years without any trouble.
“Big Billy”: Manganese deficiency
stultifies the growth of fruit-trees in some
localities and an application of manganese
is necessary. Grey speck on oats, which
occurs in some parts of the lower s.-e.
of S.A., is caused by the same deficiency
and is controlled by the addition of a
small amount of manganese to the fer-
tiliser.
“Sarina”: It is often found that
cucumbers and allied vegetables bear
better-shaped and -colored fruit when
climbing over fences. I’ve had good
results by dragging felled sapling trees
with all branches intact into the spaces
between pumpkin beds. The vines ran
all over the trees and carried their fruits
off the wet ground and out of reach of
pests. Later, when the crop was finished,
the dry saplings and rubbish were
burned to add potash to the soil.
“Bennie”: Sow carrots at any time. In
summer they require plenty of water, but
they won’t grow in a puddle. Select land
that has been previously manured, or
manure some especially for the crop and
allow to stand a few weeks before plant-
ing. Never apply fresh manure once
seeds are in, as it may cause the roots to
fork.

“Who wants any Sir Edwards?” says
Uncle Ted, looking down hard at the
newly-split posts.
“Tough luck all right, but after all
you’re no worse off than before, are
you?” says Jake, trying to sound cheery.
“No,” Uncle Ted admits. “But what
did I always tell you about newspapers?”
he says with sour satisfaction.
Jake is wondering what people will
say now.
Uncle Ted looks up and stares at the
swamp. After a while, as if he too were
thinking the same thought, he says, “Well,
you can let them all know that it was
just *bunkum like I told them. They
wouldn’t listen to me.”
“Yes. I had better say something,” Jake
agrees hesitantly.
But next day Uncle Ted says he’s
short of tobacco. He’ll go down to the
store himself. He sounds very jovial.
He marches along as though if were
spring-time instead of near winter. He
stamps loudly into the store with a big-
voiced, “Morning, Mr. Cummins! Morn-
ing, everybody!” People look at him
twice all right.
“You got your mail safely yesterday?”
says Mr. Cummins in a confidential
whisper.
“Oh, yes,” says Uncle Ted loudly.
“Oh, yes, and that reminds me. There
was something about that mad hatter
that came gassing around here the other
day. A loony lot of nonsense he told
you! ”
“Er —what do you mean?”
“All that Sir Edward rot,” laughs
Uncle Ted. “Told you I have no time
for ‘sirring’ and all that. Some old
geezer down South was the one he ought
to see. Now let me think. I wants a
couple of plugs of my usual tobacco.”
“Well, well,” says Mr. Cummins, get-
ting the tobacco. “Well, fancy that! Of
course, it’s sort of hard luck”
“Hard luck me eye!” says Uncle Ted,
laughing in the faces of the speechless
loungers about the store. And when
Uncle Ted opens his mouth to laugh
like that you can certainly hear him
laugh.
“Ha-ha-ha! ” he roars, going out. And
Uncle Ted thinks that ought to be the
end of the matter.
BUT the Tidal Creek folk can’t let
it drop like that. Clearly there’s a
mystery here. Haven’t they seen, and
handled, the official documents from the
lawyers’ office? And the “Pacific Times”
—a big newspaper like that doesn’t send
interviewers and important packets to
nobodies. The settlement buzzes with
more gossip than before.
More “proof” comes a few days later
when the storekeeper excitedly displays
another thick packet from the “Times.”
Uncle Ted doesn’t see fit to tell them
that it contains only a print of the photo
of himself and Charlie and the sledge-
load of cow-muck. Uncle Ted proudly
pins it up over the fireplace.
Nothing appears in the weekly paper
about the South Island inheritor. That’s
not news up here of course.
Another day or two brings a further
official letter from Gosper and Gosper
to the notice of the gossips. That caps
all. Uncle Ted and Jake find that it
turns out to be a duplicate copy of the
former apology sent by another clerk.
These days Uncle Ted gives nothing
away to the village pumps. He turns his
back on all their whisperings and chit-
chat. It ends with differing opinions
dividing the district. A few have it that,
of course, it’s all a spoof. They are
reckoned only jealous disbelievers.
Some insist that Uncle Ted, like a real
Enzedder with no use for this snobby
business, has renounced the title and
given the fortune to charity. More than
one or two are sure that he’s sticking to
the hoot. Others think that it was an
elder brother who got the title, or that
Uncle Ted generously handed it over to
a poor but good-for-nothing younger
brother. There is a title in the family
somewhere—that’s sure.
However you look at it. Uncle Ted is a
pretty big hero, a real man and a good
democrat. Thqt truth can’t be squashed
by the sneeriest disbelievers. The legend
grows. Jake keeps track of it, but he
won’t be pumped. He merely shrugs his
shoulders and says, “Of course it was all
a mistake about Uncle Ted’s title.”
That only serves to confirm the whole
affair. “Yes, we always knew the old dog
was as honest and modest as the day’s
long.”
Apart from the reports Jake brings
home, Uncle Ted isn’t unaware of the
way things are going. He notices the
hearty glances of manly respect. He feels
the heart-warming atmosphere. The little
signs of obsequious humility, the hints of
the spongers, the polite requests for his
support of this or that, don’t escape him.
For a change he finds it all flattering and
enjoyable. It amuses him a lot.
“I have the laugh of ’em all, Jake,” he
says. “Just think how the scrubbers
used to turn up the whites of their eyes
when I went past.”
Now all sorts of people insist on trying
to “help” Uncle Ted —though he doesn’t
need their help. People who never
noticed him before now find out what a
jolly good fellow he really is. At the
pub on Saturday afternoons they ask his
opinions of the political situation. Seated
comfortably in the long bar-room under
the shady verandah he accepts the
handle of beer, takes a long swig, puffs
quietly at his pipe for a while —and ends
up by giving no opinion at all.
“By cripes, he knows a thing or two,
that joker,” the men of the settlement
agree, wagging their heads and spitting
on the floor. The slack-mouthed bunch
of Maoris hanging on Uncle Ted’s every
word laugh uproariously and slap each
other on the back. “Golly, he the shrewd
fellow, eh?” they say.
No smoke concert is a proper success
without Uncle Ted. He drawls out what
he remembers of the long-winded yarns
of his youth, often forgetting the end of
what he begins. But they go down in
great style. The men reckon Uncle Ted’s
simply great.
Nowadays at church Untie Ted is
persuaded to sit in the best front pew.
He takes to singing, hymns and praises in
his grand old booming way, his heart
big with pleasure and goodness.
“What a fine bass voice you have, Mr.
Green,” says the parson one day after
the service.
“Well,” says Uncle Ted, “at home in
my younger days I always used to sort
of support the choir when it come to
those difficult rumbly parts.”
“Oh, you must join our choir,” says
the parson.
“I think I will,” says Uncle Ted. And
in the end he does. He puts in all those
hearty rumbling responses every Sunday
that make the church services at Tidal
Creek something to remember.

Banquet Scene.
“Alderman Shannon has urged the City
Council to prohibit smoking and face-powdering
in Sydney restaurants.”
I *was just beginning my soup when
she came in and sat down opposite me.
She lit a cigarette and exhaled a cloud
gustily across my bows.
“I hope you don’t mind my eating
while you’re smoking,” I said with heavy
sarcasm.
“Are you kidding?” she said blankly.
My answering baleful glare seemed to
disconcert her, but the effect was not
beneficial. She hastily got out her mirror
and inspected the end of her nose to see
what had offended me. Apparently it
offended her, too, because she seized a
powder-puff and went to work. A pink-
ish haze drifted across the table, and I
abandoned the rest of my soup to the
scum of talcum which mottled its surface.
The arrival of my underdone steak
seemed to strike a chord, and she went
into action with a sticky, crimson lip-
stick. Apart from the greasy, slightly
scented flavor which this imparted to the
steak, the similarity between the finished
job and what I was trying to eat had a
discouraging effect on that course as well.

Another Experiment.
“The Soviet Department of Agriculture is
seriously considering substituting elks for horses
to draw ploughs and drays.”
Serge Pantsovitch, chief of the Polit-
buro Brains Trust, looked up as Pfofessor
Nutski, Chief Agricultural Experi-
mentalist, entered the sanctum flanked by
two N.K.V.D, men. The escorts ran
practised hands swiftly over the visitor,
then withdrew.
“Now I wonder,” said the professor in
a puzzled voice, “why the secret police
would want to search me.”
M. Pantsovitch gave a short laugh.
“My dear professor,” he said, “how could
you have possibly thought they were
searching you! They were merely find-
ing out if you were ticklish. It is part of
a nationwide census we are having taken
to determine how, many of the popula-
tion are allergic to tickling. It will give
us valuable data to work on later when
we are considering whether the new
luxury-food treacle will be sold to the
masses at 1600 or 1700 per cent, higher
than to party officials and Red Army
officers.”
“I see.” The professor’s patent relief
led him to a sudden upsurge of good-
fellowship. “And how is our beloved
Fiihrer?” he asked.
“We have learned from our ambassa-
dor at Buenos Aires,” said M- Pantso-
vitch, “that Joe —er that Marshal
Stalin is suffering from his usual robust
health. That is why he was taken five
months ago to the salubrious Black Sea
resort of Miasraagrad, where at present
1600 people, all over 170 years of age,
are demonstrating Soviet toughness by
taking part in a series of six-day bicycle
races. They are being grilled by the
N.K.V.D. between laps to disclose the
secret of their remarkable longevity, and
the results are being correlated and
passed on to the Leader, who is keenly
interested. But we are not here for
small talk, Professor. It is about the
speed-up in agriculture.
“Our Red Army of seven millions at
home has to be fed. Some idiot sug-
gested sending them all to Germany,
Austria, Persia and other places to live
off the land, without stopping to think
who was going to protect party officials
if the masses turn nasty. And troops
coming back from effete capitalist
countries have seen a bit too much as it
is. Some have already openly expressed
amazement that workmen there don’t
have to walk through the snow to work
with only hessian wrapped around their
feet. Others began asking why they had
%iever seen a clock or a carpet, a pillow-
slip or a sock in the Workers’ Paradise,
although they had thrown off the shackles
of the capitalistic octopus twenty-nine
years ago. The firing squads discouraged
further questions. You will realise, then,
why we must step-up food production.”
“But I thought,” said the professor,
“that all collectivised fartns were fully
mechanised. I read in a foreign paper
where our gigantic factories deep in the
Urals could turn out 850,000 tractors a
year.”
“Are you plain dumb, Professor?” M.
Pantsovitch asked. “They were all pro-
duced by the Propaganda Department,
Since the Americans —curse them! —-
ceased lease-lend we’ve had to rely on
horses and bullocks for the Red Army’s
mobility. So you see how important elk-
power has become. Now, what is the
position?”
“Well,” began the professor, “We have
struck difficulties. We found that an
elk when harnessed to a plough couldn t
be broken of his natural tendency to
bound along, with' the result that the
plough only dug in here and there. Then
when elks were paired the ploughman
had to spend most of his time trying to
unlock their antlers. But the most diffi-
cult task was to get ploughmen who
could keep up with the elk’s terrific speed.
Although I know that Soviet athletes
hold every world land-speed record from
a hundred yards to twenty miles, I was
unable to find one who could keep up
with a plough elk. We had to confiscate
some Olympic runners from Finland.”
“And are the herds increasing?”
“Unfortunately, no. When they break
away they can’t be caught, and the num-
ber of Finnish runners capable of catch-
ing wild ones is limited. We have only
four left.”
M. Pantsovitch leaped up. “What!”
he roared.
But Professor Nutski went on sooth*
ingly. “I have high hopes, though. You
remember that M. Milawney, the Aus-
tralian Minister who was here? Well, he
told me of the wonderful burrowing
capabilities of the native wombat. II I
can cross the elk with the wombat, pro-
ducing a polled specimen, we shall have
a speedy, big natural burrower which
would allow us to turn all our ploughs
into rockets. I have written to the
esteemed M. Milawney asking him to
send me a wombat. I”
But the pfofessor got no further. Uni-
formed men had seized him, and the
livid M. Pantsovitch was ordering them
out. Five minutes later a volley rang
out, followed by a thud.
Next day the Kremlin announced the
sudden demise from thrombosis of Pro-
fessor Nutski and the appointment in his
place of Professor Gagaovitch,

THE OTHER FELLOW'S MIND

How Not to Make Money
This is the case of Smith, here described
as a manufacturer of men’s suits. He
might just as easily be. the producer of
any scarce' article from boots to bricks.
For the year ending June, 1944, Smith’s
taxable income amounted to £5OO. His tax
was assessed at roughly £lOO, The intro-
duction of the “pay as you go” system
meant that 75 per cent, of the assessment
was remitted, and the remaining £25 was
deferred over three annual payments. His
assessment therefore became: £8 deferred
tax, plus £lOO provisional tax for 1945.
Total: £lOB.
Because of the increasing demand for
his product and of his own enthusiasm
and energy, his business prospered during
1945, and his taxable income rose to
£l2OO. His assessment read: taxation,
£450 ; less £lOO provisional tax paid in
1944 ; plus £8 deferred tax; plus pro-
visional tax for 1946, £450. • The actual
sum due for payment amounted to £BOB.
In 1946 he saw a great opportunity to
expand his business. The market was
suit-hungry ; there were prospects even
of finding an export market for his pro-
ducts. With new machinery he felt that
he could double his turnover and produce
a better article at a lower cost. How-
ever, if. his business prospered and his
taxable income rose to £2OOO here is how
his 1946 assessment would have read; tax
on £2OOO, £1150; less £450 provisional tax
paid in, 1945 ; plus £8 deferred tax; plus
£ll5O provisional tax for 1947. Total to
be paid: £lB5B.
He is certainly entitled to a credit of
£ll5O, subject to next year’s tax, but he
can’t draw against it. So out of a net in-
come of £2OOO he is, in effect, left with
less than £3 a week to keep his family and
pay for new machinery.
This case is not exceptional. Thousands
of manufacturers and businessmen are
in the Gilbertian situation of know-
ing that any sharp increase in production
and profits will reduce their available in-
come to something less than the basic
wage. Many have been caught in this web
of high taxation and provisional assess-
ment a web from which they can escape
only by reducing production or by trad-
ing on the unholy blackmarket.
So the producer limits his production
and profits. So the consumer tramps the
city for goods which—if available at
&11 sell at inflated prices. So the worker,
with money in his pocket which he can-
not spend on the things he really needs,
recognises the futility of work, and is
more easily tempted to go on strike. So
the Federal Treasurer, by maintaining a
high level of taxation to avoid inflation,
actually inflates prices, lessens production
and chases potential revenue on to the
blackmarket.
An d those unutterably dull and verbose
“Labor” politicians argue during the
broadcast sessions of Parliament that high
taxation has no bearing on the incentive
not to work! —Peter Mike (W.A.),
Housing
At last a partial solution of our most
pressing problem has been found. The
S-A. Premier has been battling against
rising costs and crippling shortages with
a fair degree of success compared with
other States. Now he is hampered by
stoppages and the threatened baa on
overtime in factories which produce those
things which make a house a home.
In the middle of his dilemna he has
been advised from Canberra that he can
build cheaper houses by using fewer
fences, smaller cupboards and thinner
glass. The principle is not new It
was demonstrated in Alice when the
Cheshire cat gradually eliminated itself
until nothing remained but the grin. In
the same way the cost of a home could
be reduced until nothing was visible but
the name “Emohruo.”
The only alternative appears to be
increased production, but that, of course,
(S A) °k so * ete P re ' war theory.—L. B. W.
Paint and Fibre
“Simple Simon” (B. 6/11/ ’46) has
appropriated an apt title if he really be-
lieves that the Housing Commission is
painting the walls of hundreds of fibro-
cement cottages at a cost of £3O each.
These jobs are colored (not painted)
with water paint, and the cost would not
exceed £lO to £l2 each. The material
used would be worthless as a protective
medium for woodwork. It is composed
chiefly of whiting, small proportions of
glue, casein (dried millc) and an infini-
tesimal percentage of linseed oil, plus
water, which forms the bulk of the mix-
ture. The materials are easily procurable.
What is “S.S.’s” authority, for stating
that fibro improves with exposure to the
weather? I disagree. But water paint,
although generally used , for esthetic
effect, definitely improves fibro-cement.
My authority? I have been actively
engaged in every phase of the painting in-
dustry for over 50 years, and have been
responsible as a contractor for work to
the value of approximately a million
pounds.—Ajax (N.S.W.).
Building Regulations
“The Department of Labor and In-
dustry takes a very grave view of people
building houses in excess of limits set by
the regulations,” a prosecuting solicitor
told a recent Court in asking for a heavy
penalty for the offender.
In this case the offending house was
three times the size of the house which
may be built without a permit. The
Judge, after listening to all the evidence,
fined the builder concerned £3O.
Last Christmas, housewives were
threatened with a minimum fine of £lOO
for wrongful use of gas or power while
rationing was in force. Why, then, a
miserable £3O fine for something which
is much more of an offence against the
law? Make it £3OO minimum and prose-
cute every case to a successful conclu-
sion, give proved blackmarketers a prison
sentence without the option, and then
perhaps we’ll see reason and sanity re-
(N S building trade. —Airman
Self-bowled
The first Test match of the present
series temporarily replaced murders
and bashings in the Sydney daily press,
and, had the change brought vivid descrip-
tions of cricket, it would have been a
welcome change. It brought instead an
ill-aimed and unchivalrous barrage from
old-timers. Bill O’Reilly fired these duds:
“Toshack’s wretched form was the
greatest blow of a 11.... he bowled
only one good ball all day he suc-
ceeded in presenting a completely innocu-
ous offensive to the batsmen.” Toshack’s
“innocuous offensive” that day consisted
of 11 overs, eight of which were maidens,
and from his “wretched form” 10 runs
were scored.
Warwick Armstrong: “Toshack should
be the first player dropped from the side
... .the Board of Control should take
immediate action to have our bowlers
coached on a sticky wicket I doubt
if our bowlers are capable of dismissing
England a second time in this short
period.”
Then Neville Cardus:
On two other notorious occasions in
cricket histoiy, Australian bowlers have let
English batsmen slip from their hands in
circumstances of an unplayable wicket; the
ironic muse whispered the calendar dates
of these occasions in my ear the moment
I saw Toshack bowling from Over
the wicket. His two slips were merely
decorative, for mostly he swung to leg; a
crime most reprehensible for any left-
hander even to contemplate on sunny days
after midnight storms.
Mr. Cardus’s shots lacked the meat-axe
subtlety of his partners in “crime,” but
events disproved him just as thoroughly.
Toshack, ruination of Australia’s hopes,
took nine English wickets for 99, bowling
37.2 overs, 13 of which were maidens.
For good measure, he dismissed Ham-
mond twice.—Niloc (N.S.W.).
Nursing
Despite the tremendous advance of
medical knowledge and hospital treat-
ment the nursing profession as a whole is
still dogged by the ideas of last century.
Nurses are compelled to undergo an in-
tensive and exhausting training period
during which they are subjected to a
feudal system of discipline which, in this
day and age, is not only unnecessary but
stupid.
This is an age of individual freedom
when industry offers attractive conditions
to get adequate labor. Just how the nurs-
ing profession measures up can be gauged
from the fact that for every 100 nurses
needed to bring hospitals up to full staff
only 60 to 65 are available.
For the last two years the N. S. Wales
Department of Health has used every
possible advertising medium in an effort
to recruit nurses and domestic help for
hospitals. I have one such advertise-
ment in front of me now. It offers an
award salary of £263 a year, plus £lO
uniform allowance. This : for a general-
certificated nurse, who has had at least
six years’ training as a background!
At first sight it mightn’t seem too bad,
but it is not stipulated in the adver-
tisement that the applicant must “live in”
and conform with hospital rules and regu-
lations. The accommodation provided
may or may not be adequate, but what-
ever it is the Sister will pay for it. She
will" also work not fewer than 50 hours a
week, and often 60 or more, but there
won t be any overtime. In some hospitals
where infectious T.B. patients are cared
for no regular X-rays of staff are taken,
consequently she runs a risk of infection.
If despite these drawbacks she takes the
job and carries on there is no pension
awaiting her retirement. There is not
even * long-service leave or insurance
against disease or injury whilst on duty.
Contrast this with an average senior
factory hand,. who, after a few weeks’
training, can step into'a 40-hour-week job
at £4 10s. a week, with complete personal
liberty during her off hours, no Saturday
work and time and a half for overtime.
Factory girls also have the benefit of
award conditions which stipulate and en-
force proper amenities, regular rest
“Quiet, everyone — Rupert's going to try ‘Flight of
the Bumble Bee' in one breath !”
periods and usually a decent cafeteria
service.
If hospital and health authorities want
staff it is high time they abandoned ap-
peals to sentimentality and faced the
fact that girls are human beings with a
distinct aversion to becoming slaves. —
Wardsman (N.S.W.).
Faced with the prospect of closure of
its district hospital by staff shortage, resi-
dents of Quilpie adopted a course which
might prove useful in other similarly-
placed country areas. As the threatened
shortage arose mainly from the inade-
quate rates of pay to female staff under
the Government hospital system, residents
agreed to subscribe to a fund for
supplementing salaries to suitable amounts
and for providing bonuses for continued
service.
For each six months of continu-
ous service the matron is to receive £5O,
each fully-trained nurse £25, and each
trainee nurse £l5, in addition to her
official salary-rate. Also, any member of
the staff who remains for more than two
years will receive an extra bonus of £5O.
Fine ; but why should it be necessary if,
as is so often asserted, Government
lotteries have given Queensland a hospital
system unequalled in the world? —Q. Y.

Scientists and the U.S.S.R.
From what I have read about condi-
tions in the U.S.S.R., I have received the
impression that, however cabined, cribbed
and confined may be the lot of the ordi-
nary working-man, the scientific worker
is held in high regard. Australian scien-
tists have from time to time expressed
admiration for the work of Russian scien-
tists and the encouragement given to them
by their Government, and it has been in-
ferred that nowhere is science or the scien-
tist treated with greater respect.
It is illuminating, therefore, to read the
following comment on postal communi-
cation with Soviet scientists, published
in the English scientific magazine
“Nature”:
In September, 1945, I had the privilege,
as president of the Genetical Society, of
inviting four distinguished Russian geneti-
cists to a conference in London, to take
place on October 31. I received a reply
from one of them in February of this
year, and on May 30 a reply from another
which runs as follows:
Moscow, May 3, 1946.
Dear Mr. D ,
I am very grateful to you for your in-
vitation to the Conference of the Genetical
Society dated September 19, 1945. Un-
fortunately, it reached me on the 27th of
April, 1946, so that I couldn’t possibly
avail myself of the opportunity. I do not
lose hope of meeting you in the near
future at the next session of your society.
Very sincerely yours,
(Sgd.) N. P. Dubinin.
The letter bore the airmail postmark of
May 19, my letter having evidently been
received on April 27 and replied to six
days later. I have received no reply from
the other two invited guests.
The letter, which is signed by a London
scientist, concludes with an expression of
regret at finding, “communication with
my Russian colleagues so difficult.”
“Difficult” seems hardly the right word,
—Wusslean (Vic.).
Rehab, for Farmers
Many people tell you ex-servicemen
on the land are getting a raw deal. It
isn’t so in Queensland.
The Queensland Government advances
up to £5OOO free
o f interest for
several years a
straight-out gift of
£2OO a year at
present bank rate of
interest. In addition,
Crown rents on the
leaseholds of service-
men were consider-
ably reduced, and in
many cases wiped
altogether.
Many who have
studied rehabilitation
closely have won-
dered why the man
on the land was
singled out for such
overwhelming pref-
erence. The limit
available to the
tradesmen or busi-
nessmen in the city
is a few hundred
pounds, secured with
interest.
Don’t think I’m
jealous. Why should
I be? When I left
the Army, Rehab,
gave me £lO-worth
of books under the
heading “tools of
trade” and 50 atebrin
tablets. Junius
Jr. (Q.).
Government Aid
Are all these social services/ subsidies
and loans and grants in the best interests
of the community? As the years pass the
tendency has grown for people to look
to the Government for* assistance. In
many cases, if a man wants a house, a
farm or a business, he begins by wonder-
ing what aid he can get from the powers-
that-be.
Back in the early days the people did
not blame their Governments for housing
shortages. They built for themselves.
Many of their homes were not mansions,
but in them they found shelter and com-
fort till better times came and they could
build better.
The farmer selected his land and carved
his holding out of a wilderness. He had
his tough times, but he struggled on and
won. He did not saddle himself with big
loans and his greatest debt was to his
storekeeper—a few pounds that were
often cleared with the first crop. Now, a
man taking up a house or land under
Govemhient housing or closer-settlement
schemes will, if luck does not favor him,
spend the greater part of his life in paying
off his proposition.
Gold diggers who followed the hectic
rushes of the ’fifties formed their little co-
operative parties to work deep ground.
They built huge dams in nearly every
alluvial gully and, in one instance, they
brought water for 30 miles through an
open race for sluicing. Sawmillers, too,
built miles of tracks with bridges and cut-
tings through mountains to get their plants
into and timber out of rugged forest areas.
Those pioneers did not have much money,
but they had plenty of pluck and enter-
prise. They didn’t sit back and wonder
what aid they could get from the Gov-
ernment. They rolled up their sleeves
and got on with the job.
"Hie comprehensive social services
which drag so much out of the taxpayer’s
pocket and offer him so little were un-
heard of in those days. Certainly the
aged and infirm should be cared for;
specialists should be within the reach of
all who need them ;• and a first-class edu-
cation should be available to every child
who shows promise. But there Govern-
ment aid should end. With health,
strength, a good education and a measure
of willpower, any young man should be
sufficiently equipped to make his way in
life. Spoonfeeding will not help him, nor
will it build a nation. —L. P. (Vic.).


Beasley’s Bad Moment
Whatever feelings of national pride or
ordinary self-esteem are experienced by
our Mr. Beasley in London, they must
have been somewhat lacerated when he
heard of a brief ceremony at No. 10
Downing-street.
There General Smuts, representing
South Africa, handed to Mr. Attlee a gold
certificate for £985,000, with no con-
ditions attached except that it be used
for the advantage of the British people,
and a bank-draft for £196,625 as a special
gift from the citizens of Durban and the
Province of Natal.
It was South Africa’s way of expressing
its gratitude to the British for their con-
duct in the 1939-45 war, and the
£1,000,000-odd came from a country with
a white population of about 2,500,000.
Mr. Beasley represents a country of
over 7,400,000 whites, mainly of British
descent. Mr. Beasley also represents a
“Labor” Government which, though
gorged with tax-money, wouldn’t con-
sider making the British a gift of food,
and even tried to discourage ordinary
people from giving their humble donar
tions to a “Food-for-Britain” appeal.
Yes, if Mr. Beasley’s face is capable of
turning red it must have blushed. —
Waterfronter (Q.).
The King
When Prince Albert Frederick Arthur
George, Duke of York, suddenly found
himself King George VI, he could not
have possibly anticipated a decade such
as no English king has ever had to en-
dure. Already there had been trouble
enough, what with the death of his father,
the abdication of his brother, civil war
in Spain, Hitler in the Rhineland and
the Rome-Berlin Axis already two
months old.
Within a year Japan was invading
China ; Hitler had denounced the Ver-
sailles .Treaty; Italy was out of the League
and the Irish Free State had become Eire.
Before a second year had passed Hitler
had taken Austria and Czechoslovakia ;
Britain had given up naval control of
Irish ports and Munich had divided
Britons themselves. Although the facts
were concealed at the time, Daladier
did more to bring about Munich than
did Chamberlain, France being a nation
divided and riddled with Communism,
“sit-down” and go-slow strikes.
The war in Spain ended in 1939, but
the Germans were then in Memel, the
Italians in Albania. Molotov succeeded
Litvinov as Soviet Foreign Commissar,
and in Britain, where Chamberlain was
preparing the country for the inevitable,
the King, not long back from a visit with
his Queen to Canada and the U.S.A.,
found himself assenting to a bill for con-
scription. Then came the Russo-German
pact of August, which the Germans took
for a go-ahead signal; and George VI
was the head of an Empire at war.
Of the great anxieties and terrible days
that followed little need be said, except
that this unassuming man and his Queen
walked forth into the destruction and
gave his people cheer. Bombs fell upon
his own home ; his brother was killed ;
there were black times when all but the
stoutest quailed and the exultant enemy
trumpeted his triumphant hopes to the
world. The King remained in London.
In the following years he must often
have wondered what the end would be,
though steadfast as any other English-
man, and from the great victory of El
Alamein to the final, shattering blast on
Hiroshima must often have prayed for
and grieved over his people. On Dec.
12 another decade of kingship began.
Again the outlook for the Empire is one
of grim struggle for survival, with Europe
in ruins and a black tyranny rearing its
head in the East, But King George,
like his meanest subject, can meet the
coming years with confidence, for it is
impossible that where the combined on-
slaught of Germany, Italy and Japan
failed, any other can succeed. And in
the 10 terrible years that have passed, the
King has won the affection of millions.

Road Transport in W.A.
In fairness to the general public the
chairman of the Transport Board should
publish the real reasons why road trans-
port is subjected to such wholesale
strangulation.
The somewhat ironical titles given to
the boards governing this sort of thing
are very little indication of what they are
supposed to represent. “Road Transport
Board” and “Department of Emergency
Road Transport” would seem to indicate
bodies of men eager to organise and im-
prove methods of road transport. How
far this is from being the actual case is
illustrated by the famous Queensland
“Transport Strangulation Board.”
The general idea seems to be that road
transport must be prevented in order to
bolster up the railways finances. Yet
when the railways fail road transport is
expected to be kept going in some
mysterious way and to be ready to fill
the breach. Without the untiring indi-
vidual effort of truck operators during
the Westralian strike the whole State
would have been thrown into chaos.
It was staved off wholly and solely by the
achievements of road transport.
As soon as the strike was off all local
district fuel committees received expensive
telegrams advising that full restrictions
preventing road transport were again in
force. Without a by-your-leave or a beg-
pardon, trucks were shoved off the road
once more while the decrepit railways—
for which even the Minister feels he
must apologise—again take the stage to
the exclusion of modern speedy and effi-
cient haulage.
The main objection to unrestricted
road transport seems to be that it “picks
the eyes out” of freight, taking only first-
class stuff, relegating to the railways the
haulage of super., wheat, firewood and
other low-freight-rate items. But if the
natural laws of supply and demand and
public service give railways a subordinate
role, then we must organise things along
those lines. It would not be too opti-
mistic to claim that if road transport were
everywhere given its head the consequent
boost in the national economy would
more than compensate for the decline in
railway revenue.
This problem must be solved soon. We
cannot go on indefinitely with a de-
featist policy of keeping everything else
back so that the railways can stagger
along to an inevitable grave.—R. H. G.

Whyalla and B.H.P.
The experience of “N.1.J.” (B.
20 /11 / ’46) regarding public gratitude is
not unique. The reason is not far to
seek. The principal dogma in the Red
religion is that no man can be happy
under capitalism. If a worker “enjoys”
good conditions there is a danger that he
will “forget his poverty and remember
his misery no more.” Therefore it is
the duty of every Comrade to remind
him that his chains, even if they be of
gold, are still chains.
The better the conditions, the louder
the howl must be. Free medical atten-
tion is only one way of keeping the wage-
slave ft to work under the whip. Child
welfare is to ensure a larger population
for the slave-pen. The laying on of
water is to shackle the citizen to his job,
for if he jibs the water can be cut off.
For every amenity there is a ready-
made reason. Mention a privilege and
you will be earbashed with the parrotted
explanation. Looking a gift horse in the
mouth is no longer bad manners. It is
a sacred duty to criticise the pedigree
before acceptance.
Fortunately such sentiments are not
those of the majority in Whyalla. Ask
a few average workers when they intend
shaking the dust of the blessed place
from off their feet and you’ll find that
they are rooted to the spot.— Blow

Youth
It riles me to read attacks on present-
day youth—its lack of initiative and
spirit, its general supineness and loss of
moral values.
Physical qualities are also often ques-
tioned. But the Young Digger was an
inch or so taller than the Old and proved
between 1939-45 that there is not much
wrong with his generation.
Sporting skill comes in for criticism,,
and, during the Test match at Bris-
bane, cricketers of a former genera-
tion now established as “sporting com-
mentators” wielded merciless pens against
their successors. This didn’t stop some
new records being established.
What is too often mistaken for decline
is only change. Customs, beliefs and
traditions become outworn and out-
moded, and what was revered by one
generation is ruthlessly cast aside by an-
other. The changes are not always for
the best, but time usually retrieves and
restores the good. I like Macaulay’s
statement that “Those who compare the
age in which their lot has fallen with a
golden age which exists only in imagina-
tion may talk of decay ; but no man who
is correctly informed as to the past will
be disposed to take a morose or despond-
ing view of the present.”—K. R. (N.S.W.).
Victorian Education
Two important features of Victorian
education are threatened with extinction,
one dealing with the physical and the
other with the spiritual side of growing
children.
Some years ago the Opportunity Clubs
of Melbourne carried out experiments on
undernourished children attending State
schools in industrial districts. A few
hundred undernourished children were
selected and given a free daily lunch of
the Oslo meal, a diet perfected in Nor-
way, and costing only fivepence. The
results, carefully checked by well-known
doctors and dieticians, including the City
Health Officer, Dr. Dale, were astound-
ing.
Children who had formerly been
regarded as backward and almost hope-
less by their teachers (some of them had
even been classed as mentally deficient)
not only put on weight and height faster
than their better-nourished fellows, but
showed an unsuspected aptitude for their
lessons. A thoroughly scientific report
was presented to the Government of the
day and an offer made to extend the
meal throughout Victoria, but, as the then
Minister for Health and Education had
already committed himself to the asser-
tion that there were no undernourished
children in the Victorian State education
system, the proposal was rejected.
The Opportunities then voluntarily set
to work to do what they could with the
limited funds at their disposal, and up
to a few weeks ago were serving over
1000 Oslo meals to children in the metro-
politan area. Mr. Cain, a great critic of
his predecessor, Mr. Dunstan, has been
informed that they can’t carry on any
longer without Government assistance.
What is generally known as “Neild’s
Koornong” i§ the other institution. Neild
is an Australian who, like Neil and
Homer Lane in England, loves children,
believes there are no bad ones and is
obsessed with the problems of their edu-
cation. During the war he started 'a
small mixed school at Warrendyte, near
Melbourne, having more teachers than
pupils to begin with. The children were
taught to build their own classrooms,
write their own plays and perform them,
and express themselves in the crafts.
Local residents shook their heads 4 at the
alleged lack of discipline at Koornong,
but the quality of Neild’s rule is shown
by the fact that the number of children at
the school is now more than 80.
Delegates from the International Con-
ference of educationists in Melbourne
visited Neild’s school and were astounded
at his achievement. Having spent his own
private fortune on it, he has since been
forced to put it into the hands of trustees.
The trustees, all people distinguished in
the public life of Melbourne, have an-
nounced that they can’t carry on without
an endowment of £lO,OOO.
Men like Neild are rare in the ranks of
educationists and Koornong is certainly
as unique among Victorian scholastic in-
stitutions as the Opportunity Clubs’ en-
deavor. If these two experiments suc-
cumb through economic causes and poli-
tical indifference, Victoria will be the
loser. — Pawang (Vic,).
A Diggers’ Housing Scheme
A number of Victorian Diggers, fed up
with the housing situation, set out to
solve the problem for themselves. They
have formed a group and decided to
accept an offer of 100 acres of land near
Melbourne and begin building their own
homes. Finance has been arranged, and
members of the group will be able to
obtain a house for £lOO deposit. The
scheme has reached the stage where a
city manufacturer is prepared to transfer
“Mum told me to chop some firewood !”
his factory to the future township or
suburb. It is hoped that the movement
will grow, and that more ex-soldiers will
join up or form their own “collectives.”
In order to overcome the materials
shortage and the maddening waits for
permits which provide window-frames
but no glass, or glass but no window-
frames, the Diggers intend to use un-
orthodox materials, and of these there
are many, the best of which are mud-
brick and pise. In each of the service-
men’s allotments there should be enough
clay and earth to build half a dozen
houses. What houses badly need in the
Victorian climate is the cellars which
were a sine qua non for the early settlers.
If the houses were started with the cellar,
out of the excavation would come all the
material in earth and clay needed for the
building. Even without a cellar, the earth
from the foundations would probably be
sufficient.
Even roofs can be made of mudbrick
with a bitumenised surface, and they are
more durable and much copier than
galvanised-iron or tiles —almost unob-
tainable at the moment. Roofs can be
arched and a new note introduced into
the monotony of domestic architecture.
Mudbrick and pise make good boundary
fences.
All that is needed is an excavator and
a few unskilled workmen, who, in a few
weeks, could produce enough building
material in mudbrick to astound the Post-
war Reconstructionists. As for appear-
ance, I can assure the Victorian Housing
Commission and its army of architects
and experts that I have seen King’s
palaces built of mud and manor houses
of pise. As for durability, I have been
living for 10 years in a mudbrick house,
which I helped to build.
Sir Edward Lutyens and Strachey, two
leading English architects, tried to revive
pise and mudbrick in England after the
1914-18 war. They built handsome
country houses which, on the evi-
dence of past history, will last
for centuries, but they were defeated
by the trade-unions —pise and mud-
brick do not require skilled labor —
and master builders affiliated with the
timber merchants and fibro-cement manu-
facturers. —C. B. (Vic.).
Barrowmen
In Sydney there is a limited number of
fruit and vegetable barrows operating
under licence from the Council. These
barrows provide reasonably-priced goods
for the general public.
“Pirate” barrows have appeared. These
do not pay any licence fee and are en-
tirely illegal, and the police take every
opportunity to hunt them off the streets,
thus giving the legitimate trader a fair
deal.
These “pirate” barrowmen have re-
cently formed themselves into “The
Association of Unlicensed Barrowmen.”
At their first meeting they passed a reso-
lution whereby they will petition the
N. S. Wales Premier “to protest against
police interference and persecution.” The
point is, with our present political set-up,
this protest is likely to be taken seriously,
and the legitimate barrowmen will prob-
ably find that they are to be fined for
possessing a licence.
What a subject for Gilbert and Sulli-
van! — Fruitoh (N.S.W.).
Water and Immigrants
The war must have brought home to
Australians just how near to their home-
land are Asia’s teeming millions. They
must also have realised the appalling
emptiness of our continent and the need
for those long-overdue water-conservation
schemes which would make vast tracts
of third-rate land fertile.
Equally necessary is population. The
manpower necessary both for the holding
and development of this country is strain-
ing at the leash on the other side of the
world, anxious for a new start in life,
All that is required to bring them here is
a comprehensive programme of immigra-
tion on a scale commensurate with reality
—as distinct from present hopelessly in-
adequate plans.
All this has been said before ; it must
continue to be said until Australians are
roused from their lethargy. The Gov-
ernment which first faces up to these
pressing needs and does something about
them will really launch the nation on its
Golden Age. Bondi Beachcomber
