LETTERS
TO THE
EDITOR
UNIVERSITY OF NSW
h
The recent letter from Professor A. E.
Ilexander has again focused attention
in the unhappy state of the University of
)ew South Wales, which must surely be
Inique in the number of eminent men of
tofessional level whom it has lost
trough resignation in its short history.
,ome have departed quietly, but several
lave been quite outspoken in declaring
(heir distaste at the way in which Profes-
ir Baxter rules the University. While it
easy to resign if one is dissatisfied,
We is an alternative—namely, to seek
(edress of one's grievances internally and
iereby attempt to improve conditions
ivithin the University.
As 1 have personal knowledge of one
iuch attempt, it might be of interest not
inly to the academic staff of the Univer-
ity of New South Wales but also of
ither universities to learn that there is no
ffective mechanism within the University
pr appealing against an administrative
(decision of Professor Baxter. In this case,
die Vice-Chancellor’s ruling, which runs
punter to accepted practice in all Aus-
tralian universities, was the subject of a
fully documented appeal, endorsed by a
(prominent firm of lawyers. It was ad-
dressed to the Chancellor with the request
'that it be brought before the University
(Council. It never reached the Council,
Tut was simply referred to the Vice-
Chancellor for consideration by the Per-
sonnel Committee. Members of that
(committee were not furnished with the
| text of the complaint; the complainant
was not permitted to appear personally,
nor was legal representation allowed. Pro-
fessor Baxter, who is a member of the
committee, presented the substance of
the complaint against his ruling, and was
ln a position to justify his standpoint,
while the aggrieved party was denied a
hearing of any sort. It is hardly surprising
that the appeal was summarily dismissed.
The palpable injustice of this pro-
cedure apparently escaped the Chan-
cellor, an eminent jurist, who is the
chairman of the committee. The com-
plainant was quite unable to secure a
hearing by the governing body of the
University, despite the fact that the
merits of the case were sufficient to earn
the support of the Staff Association,
whose representations were also rebuffed
by Professor Baxter.
Events such as this give rise to the
myth of the “strong Vice-Chancellor”.
They could happen only under the unique
system of government of the University
of New South Wales, where there is no
Convocation, where the Council is sadly
lacking in men with a background of uni-
versity experience, and where the Deans,
who are permanent, are appointed, and
not, as in other universities, elected by
the Faculty for a limited period. These
facts may well explain why the Univer-
sity of New South Wales, by contrast
with every other university in Australia,
presents so unfavorable an academic
image.

SEX AND WAR
Sir,
The violence of R. M. Gascoigne's
attack on Professor May and all like
“imported” intellectuals (29/8/64) sug-
gests a basis of response to the offending
views somewhat more complex than a
simple conviction (based on evidence?)
that the less conformist and illiberal
sexual ethic given implicit support
therein would have damaging rather than
beneficial social and individual con-
sequences.
I have no idea to what extent sexual
wickedness in Australia and Germany
caused the First and Second World Wars
respectively; though I should myself be
inclined, with Alex Comfort, to expect
a connection between individual lack of
sexual wickedness and individual readi-
ness to go to war. However that may
be, Mr Gascoigne might find reassurance
in the following comment from Profes-
sor Trevor-Roper’s recent BBC lectures
on the Middle Ages: “. . . a well-known
man of letters has remarked, as a truism,
that the Roman Empire decayed as a
direct result of excessive sexual indul-
gence. I regret to say that this view,
though it has since been taken up with
lugubrious zeal by Church dignitaries,
rests on no discoverable foundations
whatever.”

INDONESIA AND MALAYSIA
Sir,
In view of our definite commitments,
it is now too late to argue whether
the course taken by Britain in ' establish-
ing Malaysia was correct or not. But
P. J. Drake’s letter, “Singapore Riots”,
and Dennis Bloodworth's article, “No
Room for Neutrals” (5/9/64), continue
the habit of presenting only the Malay-
sian side of the argument, which has been
throughout such a depressing feature of
this vital issue’s presentation in our Press
(exception: a series of articles in The
Bulletin).
Briefly, the Indonesian point of view
seems to be based on the following con-
siderations: there are in Malaysia about

WHAT
MAKES A
GREAT
WINE
GREAT?
People who know about wine
like vintners and merchants
and the people at the
next table . . .
talk about big wines
and round wines
and robust .full bodied wines.
or wines that are light,
wines that are delicate, that
linger on the palate.
But all the real dimensions in
wine come back to taste and
quality.
Orlando Barossa table wines
fulfill all the'traditions of the
finest in wine making . . .
they are, indeed, great wines
because they are the result of
dedication.
From these wonderful vintage
years, Orlando offers:
BAROSSA RIESLING, 1963
crisp, delicate, and full
flavoured.
BAROSSA CABERNET, 1959
a soft, full bodied, round red
wine.
BAROSSA SPAETLESE, 1961
from the late-picked grape
harvest . . . fresh, fruity, and
superb as a dessert wine.

Orlando prestige table wines are vintaged and bottled by G. Gramp
and Sons Pty. Ltd., in the famous Barossa Valley, South Australia.

10 per cent more Chinese than Malay
apart from what is owned by Britt
interests, Malaysia’s economy is firm
controlled by the Chinese, who also for
the main part of Malaysia’s profession;
classes. From these facts it seems (to tip
Indonesians) quite clear that the present
domination (political) of Malaysia by 4
Malayan Malays, or rather by Tunki
Abdul Rahman’s group, is based e y
clusively on British support. In othe
words, Tunku Abdul Rahman and hi
group must be “tools of British colonial
ism”, and Malaysia —in which tfe:
present political constellation can onlj
be maintained through the exertion 0
British political (and military) influencj
—a “puppet state in the service of thj
perpetuation of colonialism”.
It is well known how antagonistic
Indonesians are towards Chinese and howl
much they dread an “inevitable” military/
expansion by Red China, which they)
(and most other South-East Asian peo
pies) expect to swamp mainland SE Asia
one day. Therefore it must be for Indo
nesians most alarming to view the sett®
up of a State with a 43 per cent Chinese!

ese double-citizen.
Indonesia alone managed to obtaia
Peking’s consent (and with what diffi-
culty!) to except its citizens of Chinese
ancestry from the double - citizenship
under the Chinese jus sanguinis law, to
which all other overseas Chinese are sub
ject.
Taking the historical long-term view
can one really find fault with the logit
in the Indonesian position, as assumed
above, when its aim seems to be to sup
plant the abdicating colonial power, Bri
tain, as the “sponsor” of Indonesian
Malay supremacy in the area, and con-
trolling (and bringing under one citizen-
ship) the approximately 4} million'
Chinese of Malaysia?
I hold no brief for Indonesia, and
even during my recent visit to that
country I carefully avoided contact with
“those in authority”. But it does not
need much imagination to be able to
interpret the basic thoughts, obscured as
they are today by the thick fog of hys-
terical propaganda, which underlie the
“confrontation”.

THE NEW SYLLABUS
Sir,
It is very disappointing to perceive
the stand that some really sincere church
ministers are taking in connection with
the new NSW school syllabus. I imagine
that the majority of ministers would be
surprised to know how scripture lessons
have been treated, for many years, in
NSW schools. In fact, such lessons, if
they were given at all, often did more
harm than good. I have taught in
Government secondary schools
years, but I resigned and have con-
ducted my own private secondary coach-
ing college. Teachers still employed by

Which computer plays'HValtzing Matilda”?
LEO HI!
Some people whistle while they work.
Computers hum. Unless you feed
them with a programme which gives
them enough essential data to burst
into song. Recently we fed all 181
notes of “Waltzing Matilda” into our
own LEO 111. “Sing ” we commanded,
and LEO 111 sang.
Everyone was impressed except
CEO 111. “Kids’ stuff,” it thought
darkly, “they’re making a player
piano out of me. Don’t they know I
speak three languages, including
‘CLEO’ and ‘lntercode’? I can read
and write any one a 1,000 times
faster than a University Professor
can sign his name. I’m multi-dex-
terous with programmes. I can pro-
cess two (or even more) completely
different problems at the same time
without getting a digit mixed, yet
they’re impressed by mere music.
Huh!”
LEO 111 is not a boaster. In its
brain of brains it knows it’s good.
But like all computers LEO 111 is
only as good as the use that is made
of it. And English Electric-LEO
Computers have a team of consul-
tants, programmers, operating and
maintenance staff, backed by the
team of engineers that built the
world’s first commercial data pro-
cessing computer in 1947—which was
Genesis for the computer business!
In addition to our many installa-
tions throughout Britain, English
Electric-LEO Computers have
already supplied, and are maintain-
ing, computers in Australia. The Aus-
tralian installations include Tube-
makers of Australia, The University
of Sydney, The Shell Company of
Australia, and The Colonial Mutual
Life Assurance Society.

Mr. Hiller
and his craft
THE IMPORTANCE OF A NAME
Mr. Ernest Hiller is a craftsman.
He makes suits with more than
ordinary care.
He takes a craftsman’s pride in a
job well done. That’s why you’ll
find his own personal signature on
every suit he makes. It isn’t just
a brand name.
It’s Ernest Hiller’s personal guar-
antee to you.
It means your suit has been
tailored from the very finest fab-
rics. With the care and patience
Mr. Hiller demands.
It means you can buy the
latest international styles
for as little as £25.19.6.

the Government in primary schools
would not dare to give the true facts.
The truth is that the great majority of
teachers are absolutely uninterested in
scripture and treat it, to a certain
extent, like a spare period. Some merely
tell the pupils to revise their weak sub-
jects. Others ask the class to read the
scripture lesson quietly to themselves
so as to be able to answer a few odd
questions at the end of the lesson. In
either of these cases the teacher is free
to correct exercise books or exam papers.
There are, of course, a few sincere
Christian instructors—Protestant or
Catholic —who do their utmost to im-
part their own ideas of the particular
lesson, also of Christ's teachings, to their
pupils. Again, others—unbelievers—
teach the lesson, but in such a mechani-
cal manner that the pupils are bored
and muddled, thus more harm than good
being done.

STUDENTS’ ALP CLUB
Sir,
My initial involvement in the corre-
spondence on the ALP Club was in-
tended to correct the impression that I
was engaged in a Victorian Central
Executive inspired campaign, organised
on factional lines, to “take over” the
club. Since then both Dr Knopfel-
macher and Mr Johnston, the former
club president, have, by their actions and
statements in your columns and else-
where, made it perfectly plain that my
one and only objection to their activities
over the past year or so was perfectly
justified. This objection was, simply, that
they were not and are not ALP support-
ers in any sense, acceptable in any State,
and that their patronage and leadership
of an ALP club was damaging to that
club.
As the club has now lost many of its
most active members to the new Demo-
cratic Socialist Club (of which I am
neither a member nor a “patron"), there
seems little left to prove on my part.
But for the record, Dr Knopfelmacher’s
“strong antagonism” to the Victorian
ALP, which Mr Johnston finds so
“courageous”, was always from the
safety of his non-partisan academic re-
fuge. Unlike myself and half a dozen
others in the university ALP, he has
never been threatened with party dis-
cipline because he has never been a
party member. Mr Johnston has never
been threatened with party discipline
either, because he kept very quiet indeed
about his anti-executive views, except in
the safety of the university cafe. Indeed,
he kept so quiet that he chaired an
executive meeting of the ALP Club at
lunchtime, and joined the DLP at tea-
time of the same day, without telling
any of his fellow club members.
Anyway, now that everyone at Mel-
bourne knows where everyone stands,
perhaps the students can be left to get
on with what they want to do. It's a
pity about the once powerful ALP Club.
So far its disruption has been the only
result of the “courageous” Johnstoi
Knopfelmacher crusade against tl
forces of darkness.

TOBEY AND FAIRWEATHER
Sir,
I refer to John Henshaw’s recent re-
view of Mr lan Fairweather’s show at tht
Macquarie Galleries (22/8/64). Afte*
being clearly informed that Mr Fail
weather’s art is strongly based upon th
influences of the Far East particular!
China and having accepted a mental
picture along these lines, we are immedii
ately confounded by being told that ha
paints with “the certainty of a Persia]
decorator”.
Again, when making a compariso(
between Tobey and Fairweather, it {
maintained that they are both imbue!
with the traditions of Chinese art, par'
ticularly calligraphy. Once more it is
dangerous to accept this as indicative of
a statement of style because the reviewer
goes on to say that one of the most imj
portant aspects of Tobey’s work, hij
“white writing”, is influenced by his pri
ference for Baha'i philosophy. Baha’i is
a religious offshoot of Islam, and haij
no part at all in the Chinese heritage
What is “a kind of authority of staff
ment”? How can a conjurer be “in nee
of no gimmick”, when gimmick meaaj
“tricky device*’?
In an interpretation of a Picasso saving
we are told that “it drew together thread
of unconscious feeling”, and this is apj
plied to Fairweather's work. However,
two sentences later it is claimed thai
“his arabesques . . . spring from a ce?Sf
scions recollection”. >
And so the whole wretched business
goes on. A collection of confusing and
meaningless statements masquerading in
the guise of serious art criticism. Anj
academician might maintain that this isl
a logical outcome of the art it is attempt-i
ing to describe.

“FREEDOM”
Sir, I
Hardly ever before have I experienced!
such pleasure as I did in reading thei
article by Ross Campbell, and the letterj
by R. M. Gascoigne (on “freedom'') in
your August 29 issue. Congratulations*
to The Bulletin for printing such »l
brilliant piece of satire as “The TradK
tion of Debate”.
If The Bulletin keeps on much
longer in this vein, I'm afraid we niaf
become so dangerously mid-Victorian
that our “progressive” intellectuals will
have to leave us. What a pity.

TOYOTA have built the Lite-Stout for those who want a
really tough, hard-working, truck-size ute that has sedan
car comfort for three passengers—truly rugged but refined.
Utilities made from passenger cars just can’t carry the
truck-type loads like the TOYOTA Lite-Stout—its big load
area carries more than a ton. TOYOTA’S tough 65 B.H.P.
engine is really reliable—with lots of torque low down to
pull the big loads easily.
Under normal working conditions, loaded to capacity,
Lite-Stout gives up to 28 miles per gallon—32 m.p.g. on
light loads. The big brakes with finned drums give more
braking and less fade under heavy loads than any truck
at any price.
Easy handling, panoramic curved windscreen and passen-
ger car ride bring an entirely new feel to truck driving.
At only £1,058, TOYOTA toughness in the chassis, solid
reliability in the motor, economy on the go, Lite-Stout
gives you more for your money than any utility on the road
today.

Convivial Capsule
If it had only just been invented,
the Convival Capsule (most people
call it a “Sparklets” bulb) would
be enthusiastically hailed as a Jet
Age blessing for the harassed host.
For one thing, “Sparklets” (i.e.,
syphon and bulb) ensure that
you’re never caught short of soda
water (hands up those who
haven’t faced the unforeseen pre-
dicament of guests showing up
with an unquenchable thirst for
long cold brandies and what-
you’ll - soon - run - out -
of?). For another, a
small packet of
“Sparklets” provides
as much soda water
as you need made
in just a few seconds.
The “Sparklets” double capacity
“GLOBEMASTER” runs up 1|
quarts of fine dry soda water at a
time. In four gleaming decorator
colours, 169/- each.
The more modest “Spark-
lets HOSTMASTER”
produces 30 ozs. (same as
the “old fashioned” glass
syphon) for every 1/1 Id.
“Sparklets” bulb just
figure it, less than half the cost of
“bought” soda water; saves in
addition on bottle deposits and
the chore of returning empties
(bottles or syphons). Eight deco-
rator colours, 122/- each, glisten-
ing chromium or stainless steel,

Checkmate
Dremier Bolte in Victoria, among
many other things, is planning to
put up the duty on cheques to sixpence.
So our Melbourne correspondent had
this interesting thought.
Why not do all his banking in Can-
berra? There in the Capital Territory,
free from rapacious State governments,
there is no tax on cheques. No longer
is there any exchange on cheques state
to state. Our man feels that if only he
owned a firm like BHP he could save
a million.
Rare Pieces
T ast week Sydney’s art critics were in
something of a well-controlled twit-
ter. Their criticism for once became a
uniform hymn of praise. The occasion
was the exhibition of pre-Columbian art
at the Newman Gallery in Castlereagh
Street.
However, when we saw Mr Newman
at his gallery he was in a somewhat
melancholy mood. He had just completed
the sale of two figures, a male and a
female, from the collection of 60 pieces.
“It's rather sad to see them go,” he said.
“After all, I have had them under my
eye for about nine months. The more
you see them the more you like them.
They do grow on you.”
This is only the seventh exhibition
which Mr Newman has put on at his
gallery. The average has been two a
year; this at a time when most Sydney
galleries are still bundling one painter
out the back door while they are pouring
the sherry for the next opening.
The exhibition is the first major show-
ing of pre-Columbian art in this country.
It has attracted a good deal of attention
from what seems a surprising cross-sec-
tion. Mr Newman is old-fashioned
enough as a gallery-owner to be happy
to spend his day pointing out aspects
, of the pieces to people who obviously
haven’t the price of a piece of pre-Col-
umbian art in their pocket, to find out
their reactions, and sometimes doing a
little polite eavesdropping.
Mr Newman said that the collection
had come to him in two segments. He
had bought 45 pieces in the Middle East
from a Canadian millionaire who had
switched enthusiasms, in the way that
millionaires can and do. Fifteen pieces
had belonged to a European who had
brought them to Australia from Mexico,
but who recently returned to Mexico.
To date, with the exhibition still cur-
rent, Mr Newman has sold about one-
third of the pieces. This he regards as
quite satisfactory. The Art Gallery of
NSW has bought a major piece. The
Technological Museum has done some
wistful window-shopping. But Mr New-
man does not know yet whether any of
the other State galleries are customers.
It seems unlikely that the exhibition will
result in any one gallery or public build-
ing gathering even a moderately sized
showing of pre-Columbian. There is little
chance of the collection going interstate
complete.
However, the important thing is that
whether the pieces are sold or not, they
will remain in this country. Although
Mr Newman would be the last person to
pose as a benevolent public patron of
the arts he is a dealer who must think
in economic terms this is the point
he clings to. With the previous exhibi-
tions, of New Guinea primitive art, of
Australian modern painters, of Oriental
potteries, of Eastern miniatures, Japanese
color prints and Thai and Tibetan sculp-
ture and bronzes, the unsold residue has
stayed here. Most of the sales, except for
the odd piece sold to a visitor, have been
to Australians. And Mr Newman, who
came here in 1948 from Europe to find
a people wedded to Victoriana, grows
more and more confident that there are
enough people here to appreciate and
buy his exquisite wares.
First Steps
iy|R Richard Bonynge was fresh from
A auditioning 150 singers for next
year’s tour by the Williamson-Sutherland
Opera Company. It was hard work, he
admitted, but then he had come here—■
his first trip home in 14 years pre-
pared for hard work. Mr Bonynge will
be musical director for the company in
which his wife will star.
He has now gone off to the United
States where for the next nine months
Miss Sutherland will sing in opera per-
formances and concerts over much of
the Eastern States. But things are under
way here for next July. Of the 150 hope-
fuls about 15 will join the Elizabethan
Opera Company’s chorus for the season.
Most of the singers are now decided on,
but nothing will be said until contracts
are signed. All sets and costumes will be
made in Australia (Williamson’s work-
shops in Melbourne will do sets for 15
productions between now and next July).
They will be designed by Tonina Dorati,
daughter of conductor Antal Dorati. Miss
Dorati has never previously done work
for Miss Sutherland.
Things are going well, but Mr Bonynge
admitted little disappointment” in the
standard of many of the voices he had
heard. He did not feel that the musical
standard generally was higher than it
was in 1950 when he left Australia for
Europe. But, he added, the advent of the
Trust company presenting operas with
some degree of permanence meant that
“stagewise” the level was higher. He had
seen the Trust’s “Carmen” and the two
Orff pieces and thought them very good.
He has no misgivings at all about the
future of opera. “Opera depends on
wonderful singing,” he said. “That is
what people go to hear. Everything else
must be right, sets, costumes, acting and
so on but people will always go to hear
a wonderful singer.”
Consultation
A colleague whose cat developed a
sore tail is contemplating the pro-
fessional attendance an animal receives
these days. Gone are the days when you
popped the protesting cat into a basket
and took it to the vet. who either gave it
some pills or “put it to sleep.”
The cat in question was collected,
spent three days in hospital and when
returned showed a marked improvement.
Edinburgh Success
Qydney writer Ray Mathew has had
his play, “A Spring Song”, produced
in Edinburgh during the Festival. The
play was put on by the Oxford Theatre
Group as a fringe production. The play
was well received by the Scottish critics
—the “Glasgow Herald” said: “Although
the Fringe has not produced an out-and-
out smash hit this year, the level of per-
formance has been commendably high.
One’s personal choice for the Fringe’s
laurel and indeed the dramatic prize
for the Festival as a whole—would be
Ray Mathew’s Australian play ‘A Spring
Song’.” However, not much of this
praise filtered through to the London
Press.


Later our friend received an intriguing
account which read:
Consultation to cat at home £1 10 6
3 days in hospital at 7s. 6d. 12 6
Feline anti-serum 15 0
3 injections penicillin
and streptomycin 10 6
Inj. long-acting penicillin
and streptomycin 12 6
Elephantine
The Omsk Siberian Dancers, currently
at Her Majesty's Theatre, Sydney,
lack the elan and agility of the Cossacks,
and their turgid folksongs sung by an
elephantine chorus of ageing maidens are
no threat to Miss Marian Henderson.
Nevertheless, at £2 10s. a pop, the
Siberians are playing to packed houses
and their audience in Sydney one night
last week included such notables as Les
Haylen, Jim Cairns and Abe Landa.
A friend who attended reported that
during a particularly sombre third en-
core of that well-known Siberian folk-
song “Waltzing Matilda” he was rebuked
for uncontrollable mirth by his neigh-
bor who informed him tartly “We like
Waltzing Matilda.” Fleeing from the
theatre at interval he was startled by
the inexplicable roar of sirens from the
ambulance depot next to the theatre.
It was, he thought, a clear indication
that a hidden DLP cell working within
the ambulance station would stop at
nothing to disrupt this cultural tour de
force.
By Gaslight
11/’e heard about a woman who died
recently, whose stone cottage on the
waterfront at Hunter's Hill, Sydney, was
still softly illuminated by gas. She had
never bothered to make the change to
new-fangled electricity. However, in this
she was almost on her own. Although
the gas companies are in strenuous com-
petition with the electricity authorities
over most of the range of appliances,
they have conceded lighting to electricity.
At Hunter’s Hill, too, one resident
with a feeling for the past has had the
light at his front gate connected to the
gas main and each night goes through
his lamplighter’s bit. But, of course,
Hunter's Hill is that sort of place.
Running Wild
“T’ve joined the Historical Society and
the Horticultural Society and now
I'm getting in on this,” the woman ahead
of us said. “This” was the spring show-
ing of wildflowers organised by the
Society for Growing Australian Plants,
and held at Anthony Hordern’s, Sydney,
The society means exactly what it says,
It aims to preserve native plants from
extinction, encourage their growth fo
gardens, and encourage the development
of hybrids more suitable for gardens
than many of the flowers are in their'
native state.
The exhibition included flowers from
Western Australia and orchids from
Townsville as well as New South Wales
varieties. However, indoors, most had:
wilted rapidly, a reminder of how frail!
and fleeting is their beauty.
Keeping Tabs
difficulty of finding names for newj
A products is increasing as rapidly as 1
the new products themselves. The senior!
vice - president of one of America’s
largest advertising agencies, McCann-;
Erickson Inc., Mr Neal Gilliatt, told aj
meeting in Sydney that to find a suitable;
name for a new low-calorie soft drinki
for the diet-conscious, weight-watching
Americans, the Coca-Cola Company
used a computer.
The computer's answer was “TAB",
which here already represents the

PLAIN ENGLISH
The Price of Retaliation
tpo date, Indonesia has had every-
A thing its own way. From the
sanctuary of Kalimantan it has been
a simple matter to send guerrillas
and regulars into Sarawak and
Sabah to conduct hit-and-run raids
on security forces and defenceless
villages and to foment rebellion and
disaffection among the indigenous
people. It has been just as easy to
make paradrops into Malaya itself
of Malay nationalists, Chinese Com-
munist saboteurs and trained troops
to stir up doubt and dissension and
promote race riots such as those
which have disfigured Singapore in
recent weeks.
All of these actions, which are
little short of open war, have been
conducted with impunity and have
taken a severe toll of Malaysia’s
limited military, financial and
political resources. And yet the
price of retaliation is uncertain and
heavy—just how uncertain is in-
dicated by the continued reluctance
of Canberra, ever mindful of our
land border with Indonesia in New
Guinea, to use Australian troops in
actual combat against Indonesians.
The question exercising political
strategists in London, Washington
and Kuala Lumpur is whether the
RAF’s delta - wing bombers in
Malaya should not take off and
bomb training camps and assembly
points for Indonesian terrorists in
Indonesian territory a Tonkin
Gulf type action. It would be
militarily simple.
The difficult question is: what
then? The real stake at issue in
Confrontation, as has always been
painfully clear, is Indonesia’s rich
islands and 100,000,000 people. It
is doubtful whether the Soviet
Union will ever offer much more
than limited aid or that Communist
China can offer much more than
pious exhortation. Communist
bloc aid to Indonesia is not a major
problem, but the delivery of Indo-
nesia to Communist ideology is.
Despite its enormous Communist
Party, Indonesia is not yet a Com-
munist country and the precarious
balance of the political parties,
maintained by the Army in uneasy
alliance with the President, may be
indefinitely prolonged. An outright
military attack on Indonesia, es-
pecially a humiliating defeat, would
force it into the Communist bloc
politically, a situation in which the
PKI could very easily emerge as a
mass popular party able to defy
President, Army and majority will.
It is obviously the fear of a
Communist takeover of Java which
has prevented, up till now, any-
thing stronger in the way of military
retaliation than standard defensive
activities. And yet the point is
being reached where Malaysia, in
the interests of its own survival,
must be prepared to take retaliatory
action. As it has not the resources
to do this, it must look to its allies,
among whom is numbered Aus-
tralia. The consequences, in this
race - conscious world, of using
white troops against brown, beggar
the imagination. No one should for
one moment imagine that the rest
of Afro-Asia will look with favor
on the use of white “mercenaries”.
But something must be done, for
Confrontation is reaching the point
of no return.
The Boycotts
boycotts have again begun
to affect Australian commercial
life most recently the attempt by
Arab States to boycott certain Aus-
tralian businessmen (see story, page
16), and the Waterside Workers’
Federation refusal to handle South
African goods. The same point is
raised in both cases the differ-
ence between legitimate public
propaganda for the sake of a prin-
ciple and intimidation or force in
the name of a principle.
Mr Justice Gallagher did not
directly raise this issue last week
when he rebuked the Waterside
Workers’ Federation. He had two
separate points. One was that al-
though the Federation’s members
are entitled to form their own
opinions on any issue, political,
social, or economic, they “have no
right to attempt enforcement of
policy by resort to strike action”.
His second was that “waterside
workers should recognise that these
so-called protest stoppages merely
make them dupes of political agita-
tion bent on damaging the economy
of the country”.
As for the first point, whatever
may be the legal position, some
people may even be impressed by
the wharfies’ apparent willingness to
lose money for the sake of the pro-
test. But the crucial point is it is
this sympathy from one part of the
public that has led the Communist
directors of these protests to select
this particular cause. Their interest
is disruption and keeping themselves
in control of it, and Federation
members, in going along with their
plan, are helping undermine Aus-
tralia far more than they are help-
ing undermine South Africa. If they
were seriously interested in the
principle raised, they would propa-
gandise publicly against South
African goods.
In the case of the Arabs, again
whatever may be the legal position,
they are not conducting legitimate
public propaganda but attempting
to intimidate Australian business-
men behind the scenes. As with the
WWF, their basic motive also has
nothing to do with Australia’s
national interests, and they are un-
willing to operate in the open and
let the public have a choice.
There is nothing wrong or illegal
about boycotts in themselves. They
happen all the time and many
people would like to see more
of them. Some people want to
organise against South African or
Israeli goods, others want to organ-
ise against, say, Czechoslovakian
cars, Communist Chinese textiles,
or Arab cotton. The point is that
the democratic and effective place
for this sort of agitation is in the
open market place where, apart
from anything else, the weakest
cases will be quickly exposed.

Arabs “Blackmail”
Australian Businessmen
A cloud still over the Qantas affair
FROM A MELBOURNE CORRESPONDENT
SIR B. JANNER
“Aid and comfort”
Datelined Damascus, Syria, PO Box
437, and signed by Mohammed
Mahoud Mahgoub, Commissioner-
General, Central Office for the Boycott
of Israel, a letter to F. Heller and Co.
of Parramatta, NSW, agents for the
Israeli Swimsuit Company, Diva, asked
for a declaration “duly certified by your
Chamber of Commerce or Industry or
executed before a Notary Public in your
place of business and authenticated by
the closest Consulate or diplomatic mis-
sion of any Arab country".
The declaration was to answer ques-
tions about links with Israel in the form
of agencies, branches or offices. Did
the recipient own shares in any Israeli
firm or business? Was the firm or any
of its directors a member of any Israeli
Chamber of Commerce in Israel or
abroad?
If the answer to any of these questions
was yes, then documents undertaking
never to represent Israeli companies in
the future or import their products were
to be sent to the boycott apparatus.
In case there was any misunderstand-
ing the letter added, in the best boycott
prose: “I hope that you will understand
the considerations which render this
request which is basically aimed to the
interest of your company and that you
will not consider it, according to mis-
leading Zionist propaganda as an
attempt to exert pressure on you or inter-
ference in the affairs of your company.
On the contrary, the boycott apparatus
do not absolutely think of that. Our
sole aim is to avoid stopping trading with
your company without giving it a fair
chance to explain the motives for that
action, and try to eliminate them if you
find this fit for you, since the whole
matter is left for your judgment.”
Then the company has three months
to act. Otherwise the boycott office is
“forced with deep regret to recommend
banning transactions”.
The Embassy of the United Arab
Republic in Canberra admitted the oper-
ation of the boycott apparatus in Aus-
tralia. A spokesman pointed out that
this did not contravene international law
because the Arab States felt they were
still in a state of war with Israel.
The Arab States have intensified their
boycott activities in the past year all
over the world, the British Lord Man-
croft affair being one result. (A Jewish
director of Norwich Union Insurance
was forced to resign because he had busi-
ness interests in Israel.) Most recently
the boycott has been stepped up in the
United States and Latin American coun-
tries where Arab interests have made no
secret of open co-operation with local
anti-Semitic and Fascist organisations.
Although the Central Office for the Boy-
cott of Israel is believed to have been
circularising Australian businessmen over
the past year, it was only the Parramatta
case this month that brought it to general
public notice.
The Melbourne - based Executive
Council of Australian Jewry has called
a special meeting to discuss the boycott.
ECAJ secretary Mr I. J. Leibler des-
cribed the boycott attempts as “an out-
right act of naked economic blackmail
which will be resented and resisted by
all Australians”. Fie expected that the
whole matter would come under con-
sideration by the Federal Government.
Of even more concern in the Jewish
community than the evidence of Arab
boycott activity has been the cloud
surrounding the Qantas affair. After a
storm was raised in Jewish circles about
Qantas allegedly giving in to Arab boy-
cott threats and reversing an earlier
decision to set up a sales office in Tel
Aviv, the Minister for Aviation, Senator
Henty, gave a public assurance that there
had been no pressure. Jewish sources
understand that the Arabs approached
the Australian Ambassador in Cairo and
threatened the removal of landing rights
at some Arab airports.
He said, and Qantas confirmed, that
the earlier publicly announced decision
(complete with a diplomatic cocktail-
party) to send a representative to Tel
Aviv had been changed for “commercial
reasons”.
The new office would now be in
Teheran, serving passengers en route to
and from Israel. There was no other
explanation.
Despite the official assurance, it is an
open secret that Jewish leaders and
public opinion are not satisfied. Too
many questions about the timing of the
move and the events surrounding it have
remained unanswered. A visiting leader
of British Jewry, Sir Barnett Janner,
MP, discussed the matter with Sir Robert
Menzies earlier this month. He said it
appeared from Qantas’s action that it
was giving “aid and comfort” to the
boycott.
Sir Barnett himself decided not to fly
back to Britain by Qantas, although he
had flown that service from Los Angeles
to Sydney. Unofficially there is a move
under way within certain sections of the
Jewish community not to use Qantas
until the whole issue has been brought
into the open.

General Strike by British Migrants?
An inquiry for Preston
FROM DAVID McDOUGALL IN MELBOURNE
1%/lelbourne was a restless town last
week. With the rising prices re-
ducing the value of the 20s. basic wage
increase to nil, Mr Bolte’s “shock” Bud-
get, tram strikes, more trouble on the
waterfront, unionists storming the doors
of Parliament House and a Young Labor
Association protest procession, the city
was in a continual state of turmoil.
In fact, things were so unsettled that
the management of “The Herald” took
precautions to bar the demonstrating
unionists from its Flinders Street offices,
just in case they decided to try to
repeat history of earlier years. But the)'
did not take things quite that far.
One of the less publicised aspects of
the week of unrest was a group of Bri-
tish migrants, who joined the general
disturbance by protesting against then
living conditions at a hostel out i®
Preston. Such protests are nothing n e "' !


but this one took further steps than usual
and made one wonder how much longer
the authorities can go on believing the
hostel set-up is adequate. Sixty migrants
decided to withhold their weekly board
and lodgings fee unless an eviction
notice, served on one of their members,
was withdrawn.
The notice was served on a migrant
who had refused to pay his weekly fee
because of the monotonous, below-par
meals and the breaking down of a clothes
dryer. His four children were sick, and
had to wear damp clothes. The dryer
was fixed and he paid-up so the eviction
notice was withdrawn and the whole
affair blew over.
Although the serious nature of the
situation was generally not realised, the
officials of Commonwealth Hostels Limi-
ted saw a big enough spark of danger
to appoint an inquiry into the general
grievances out at Preston. The com-
pany is a non-profit organisation, subsi-
dised partly by tax and partly by migrant
fees, which operates all Australian hostels
under Commonwealth Government
sanction. A general strike by migrants
against paying fees until they get better
conditions is completely feasible and
could cause a break-down to this valu-
a^e P ar * Australia s immigration
scheme.
*he Australian image in England
could suffer a considerable knock-down
such a situation ever arose. Although
num t>ers returning home are only
around about seven per cent, there are
indications that they are growing. Out
at Preston, some migrants claimed that
almost half of their members were going
back once their compulsory two-year
stay was up.
BUDGET
Is Bolte Bluffing
About Income Tax?
Poker machines! Definitely not!
FROM J. C. HORSFALL IN MELBOURNE
H. E. BOLTE
Poker-faced
\ serious proposition, or merely a
rough exercise in Commonwealth-
State financial diplomacy? This is the
question Mr Bolte posed by his shock
proposal in the Victorian State Budget
Speech to reimpose State income tax on
July 1 next year, after a lapse of 23
years.
From where I sat in the Press gallery,
Bolte gave the impression of this being
his biggest try-on yet to get more money
direct from Canberra. From his more
than usually poker-faced reading, one
cannot at this stage predict how far he
will go in planning the introduction of
the tax. But obviously from the text of
the announcement, and, I understand,
from other sources, his main intention is
once again to bring the ever-simmering
pot of Federal tax reimbursements to
the boil. (This is not to say that the
proposal is not feasible or that in the
last resort Bolte would not put it into
effect.)
With the Prime Minister conveniently
>n Melbourne for a Federal Cabinet
meeting, and acting as Treasurer in the
absence of Mr Holt in Tokyo, Bolte’s
message soon got home to where it could
hurt most. Admitting he had not given
the Federal Government any preview of
his proposals, Bolte had it sent to Sir
Robert by hand and sought an early dis-
cussion on the matter. Sir Robert,
being an old hand at this game, readily
obliged. Like myself he has doubtless
not forgotten a certain hot Saturday
afternoon in Canberra in February, 1953,
when he offered the assembled Premiers
to vacate the field of income tax up to
the existing scale of tax reimbursements;
they immediately packed up and went
home.
Though Bolte denies the implication,
one cannot get away from the fact that
a special Premiers’ Conference is coming
up to review the existing Commonwealth
taxation reimbursement agreement ex-
piring next June. In 1959, as a lead
up to that agreement, Bolte threw into
the ring a proposal that each State
should decide it own rates of income
tax, leaving the Federal Government in
the role merely of tax collector. That
proposal would seem to be unconstitu-
tional on the grounds that taxation im-
posed by the Federal Government must
be uniform throughout the Common-
wealth, but even if it may seem like
splitting hairs, this is not to say a special
additional income tax imposed by any
one State would necessarily be invalid.
The latter would be the reverse of what
Sir Robert Menzies offered the Premiers
in 1953.
Of course it is part of the game for
the Premier to say “This is no stunt”,
but if Mr Bolte is really serious about
imposing a special State income tax and
is not merely using it as a lever to get a
better tax deal from Canberra, one might
have thought—from his scraping of the
barrel to close a gap in the State’s ac-
counts this year and his determination
not to have a bar of poker machines
which foot £5 million or so of the NSW
Government’s bills—that he would have
introduced it immediately, instead of
waiting a year.
True, this would have posed great
administrative difficulties and, from what
he has said since the Budget, the Pre-
mier has only been convinced that State
income tax is the answer since his let-
down at the last Premiers’ Conference
when, as he stated on television, in his
view the Federal Government was badly
advised and should have given Victoria
a lot more.
Further support for the view that
Bolte is bluffing comes from the fact that
without a special income tax he has
still managed to balance the Budget this
year and presumably, with the natural
rise in revenue from both Federal and
State sources, he would have an equal
prospect of doing so in future years.
As a matter of fact, he admitted in
his Budget speech that Victoria is a
bit behind the times in its revenue-
raising devices. The most intriguing
feature of his revenue-raising proposals
this year is that although he will not
emulate NSW’s money - raising from
poker machines, this did not stop him
trying to sell practically all of his addi-
tional imposts on the ticket that they are
only catching up with those in other
States, notably NSW.
Thus the State railways will now have
to pay interest and sinking fund charges
on loan expenditure incurred since
June, 1960. The NSW position was
quoted as the precedent. “In NSW the
railways meet a substantial portion of
their debt charges from railway income,”
said Bolte. The recoup of railway debt
charges will provide £1,570,000 of the
£5,770,000 extra revenue the Victorian
Government needs to balance its Budget
this year. Again quoting NSW practice,
another substantial sum will be charges
to the State’s own Electricity Commis-
sion by the introduction of a 3d. a ton
royalty on coal. “The NSW Budget
benefits substantially from royalties on
minerals,” the Victoria Premier told
Parliament.
But the biggest slug is £2,800,000
extra for stamp duties, including a
doubling to 6d. on cheques, compulsory
receipting of bills over £2O. (Britain
abolished all receipts several years ago.)
Also “the scale of duty on gifts will be
brought closer in line with NSW rates”.

EDUCATION
Melbourne’s Run-down
University
Notes from a restricted book
SIR G. PATON
“Work-horse”
From a Melbourne Correspondent
A 29-page book in a red jacket has be-
** come a best-seller among academics
at Melbourne University. With the pro-
saic but apt title of “The Crisis in the
University” it details the financial and
academic doldrums of Victoria’s pre-
mier, but overcrowded university. To
date, the report has remained on the
restricted list.
Published by the Staff Association, it
warns of the tangible crisis of finance
the University faces—at least £600,000
is needed immediately for books, extra
staff and facilities and the less tan-
gible but more worrying crisis of morale.
The deterioration in morale affects
both students and staff. Because of over-
crowding, the Chairman of the Univer-
sities Commission, Sir Feslie Martin,
has suggested that Melbourne Univer-
sity will have to limit its student intake
next year, and the staff fears that it may
not only have to limit new academic ap-
pointments but will have to sack some of
its present staff.
The facts which the report sum-
marises come from most faculties and
departments.
In the humanities the deficiency of
the Baillieu Fibrary provides material for
sick humor among undergraduates:
one book to 500 students for an essay;
duffle-coats lying on the floor turn out
to have bodies in them English
honors students preparing tutorial
Papers; students avoid the library rather
than tackle the frustrations of finding
some space to stand, let alone a seat.
In the physical sciences, second and
third year physics students are missing
out on tutorials, and chemistry post-
graduate research scholars are having
a quarter the amount of money neces-
sary spent on their needs.
The present situation, claim staff
Members, is the result of years of bad
Planning, or in many cases no planning
at all for growth. For at least the past
ave years major university research
departments have leased premises over
the Italian bistros and delicatessens of
Carlton’s Fygon Street. Tutorials have
moved from disused bathrooms to
disused kitchens.
The £600,000 could overcome some
of the more pressing and immediate
problems. In the long-term a thorough-
going overhaul of Melbourne Univer-
sity’s financial, academic and adminis-
tration needs seems essential.
But even in the short term Sir Feslie
Martin was non-committal about
whether the £600,000 would be found.
He said he hoped some of it would.
The harassed Vice - Chancellor at
Melbourne, Sir George Paton, pointed
out that Melbourne was still the “work-
horse” of Australian universities. It pro-
duced 26 per cent of the graduates. Fast
year it had 100 more than Sydney. Yet,
claimed Sir George, Sydney received 19
per cent of the available grants, while
Melbourne received only 16 per cent,
even so, he w 7 as hopeful that the im-
mediate crisis could be overcome.
THE FAIR
Funland?
Mr Perkins comes back
FROM A MELBOURNE CORRESPONDENT
EFhe Chairman of the Melbourne World
"*■ Fair Project, Sir Maurice Nathan,
has announced that two experts from the
Stanford Research Institute, California,
would come to Melbourne soon to help
design the feasibility study for the
Fair. Some £50,000 has been budgeted
for this survey, which is designed to
show whether or not the World Fair is a
practicable proposition. The two Ameri-
can visitors will not undertake this major
survey, but will merely spend a fort-
night or so preparing an outline of how
it should be conducted.
One of the Americans named by Sir
Maurice is Mr Ed Perkins who has been
in Melbourne before. That was in 1960
when Mr Perkins reported on the
feasibility of building a £sm. Fun Fair
near Werribee, “Australialand”. Accord-
ing to Mr Perkins, the Fun Fair was
practicable, and would attract 1,200,000
visitors annually. It was never built.
However, links like this with the
“Australialand” Project are not helping
the World Fair idea to be taken
seriously.

Aborigines in
Rat-infested Squalor
Is their conservatism to blame?
ALD. JENSEN
Tough
FROM GORDON CHESTERMAN IN SYDNEY
I ast week, Sydney’s Lord Mayor,
J H. F. Jensen, ordered health in-
spectors to investigate the living con-
ditions of Sydney’s 10,000 Aborigines,
and tough action against certain land-
lords is expected. The investigation
follows Press reports of Aboriginal
families living in rat-infested, flooded
dwellings; of 20 Aborigines living in a
two-bedroomed dilapidated house; of
landlords’ discrimination against Abo-
rigines forcing them to accept sub-
standard dwellings for which exorbitant
rentals are charged by landlord sharks.
Last week The Bulletin toured Abo-
riginal homes in Sydney, particularly in
the Redfern area, to confirm the reports.
In one case two Aboriginal boys clam-
bered out on to the verandah of a
terrace house to sleep, while 18 other
people, mostly children, slept on the
inside. Another woman, recently arrived
in Sydney to give her children a better
chance of education, has to pay £ll 10s.
a week for a poorly furnished flat.
According to the 58-year-old president
of the Aborigines’ Progress Association,
Mr Bert Groves, JP, a man to whom
most Aborigines look to as their leader,
the Aborigines are partly to blame.
Aborigines, he said, have accepted a
standard of living that is revolting and
repulsive to standards of decency, and
unless they are shaken out of their com-
placency there is little hope of a good
future for coming generations. “Our
problem is our own conservatism.”
Twenty-five years ago Aboriginal
children were poorly educated, Mr
Groves said, and “we can’t say that
today. But education is useless unless
combined with good environment”.
He sees the greatest hope for Abo-
rigines in the recently formed Founda-
tion for Aboriginal Affairs. Already
the Foundation aims at raising £150,000,
most of which will be poured into the
establishment of the centre, the employ-
ment of the first Aboriginal social work-
ers in Australia, and the founding of
several scholarships.
Among its many other objects will be
to give special attention to education,
employment and accommodation.

A Referendum
on State Aid?
Leftist-Protestant Alliance
From a Sydney Correspondent
Tf, as reported last week, combined Pro-
■*" testant organisations in NSW, Vic-
toria, South Australia and Tasmania go
ahead with their plans for a High Court
challenge to the Federal Government’s
science facilities grants private schools,
they will have solid backing from the
Left-wing of the ALP.
The Victorian ALP has nailed its
colors firmly to the “No Aid” mast. In
an official statement last week it said:
“The right of the Catholic Church to
charge any of the cost of its system
against the State is not recognised by
Labor.”
Simultaneously West Australia, at the
instigation of Mr F. E. “Joe” Chamber-
lain, has called for a halt to any “Aid”,
particularly by Labor governments, pend-
ing a referendum on the issue—in which
educational issues or questions of justice
would be obviously swamped by religious
bitterness.
Mr Chamberlain, described by NSW
Labor leaders as the greatest vote loser
in Labor history, is unperturbed by
the certain adverse reaction of his “No
Aid” stand on the imminent Senate,
NSW, and South Australian elections.
He looks certain to be backed by the
numbers, where they count, on the ALP
Federal Executive and Conference.

FLUORIDATION
A “Thing” in
Canberra’s Water
Up from Lower Hutt
J. KILLEN
Fire
FROM JOHN WEBB IN CANBERRA
Last week the ACT Supreme Court
set the seal of victory on the
fluoridationist cause in a decision which
may have national significance.
Two Canberra residents, who also
happened to be candidates for the ACT
Advisory Council elections, made a last-
minute legal attempt to block fluorida-
tion of Canberra’s water supply.
The basis of their argument for an
injunction restraining Interior Minister
Anthony from adding fluoride to the
water was that it would contravene a
Public Health regulation which prohibits
the placing of any “thing” in the water
supply system of the territory. They
did not contend that fluoridation would
be a public nuisance and they made no
attempt to show there was any danger
involved.
The only “damage”, they claimed, was
the infringement of their right not to
have a substance added to water
“bought” from the Department of In-
terior by way of rates.
Mr Justice Bridge, while not con-
ceding that the Minister's action would
constitute an offence under the regula-
tion, said he would not have granted the
injunction anyway. He declared: “Any
right in either plaintiff to protection un-
der the regulation in question would be
purely a public right, and in no sense a
private right, and I have no evidence
before me that any infringement of that
right would cause to either plaintiff any
particular damage not suffered by other
water consumers.”
Barely three hours after the judgment
the fluoride was placed in the water
supply for the first time, and fluoride
supporters throughout Australia were
delighted.
Their assessment is that the first Aus-
tralian judicial decision has been made
on the question of fluoridation’s infringe-
ment of personal liberties and Mr Justice
Bridge has set a precedent for subse-
quent cases elsewhere in Australia.
The Privy Council decision in the
Lower Hutt, New Zealand, case virtually
closed the argument that ordinary water
was pure and water plus fluoride was
impure. Fluoridation supporters say their
opponents have not won a “personal
liberties infringement ’ case throughout
the world, and now have no chance of
doing so in Australia.
One of the unsuccessful applicants
for an injunction refused to say whether
or not he favored fluoridation but said
the citizens should be given the chance
of deciding for themselves. A member
of the Advisory Council was reported
to be collecting a list of signatures of
residents who wanted “de-fluoridation”
filters fitted to their water taps.
The “Canberra Times” and the local
edition of “The Australian” ran a series
of front page stories, including one
expecting that Queensland Liberal MHR,
Mr Jim Killen, would make a fiery
attack on the Government. But there
was little to show that Canberra resi-
dents cared much either way. They
were probably content to know that the
addition of a millionth part of fluoride
to one part of water would eventually
mean a drop of about 60 per cent in
dental caries in the Territory.

reporters assembled last
week at the Peace Congress head-

Dr A. G. H. Lawes “refute” the charge
by the Federal Attorney-General, Mr B.

peace movement in Australia. In fact,
with the help of Mr Yuri Yasnev of

Dr Lawes sat at the head of the table
flanked by Mr G. Anderson, DFC, of the

A schoolmaster at Avenel a

dried paper wads. We never allowed
a trifle like this to ruffle our compo-

Q. “Do you think the Menzies Govern-
ment was under the influence of the
Communist Party of Soviet Union or
of Australia when it put its signature
to the Test Ban Treaty? I am having
a joke. But could not the questions be
a little more constructive? For
example, what does the Congress
hope to achieve?”
In answer to this, it turned out that
the Congress would initiate moves to set
up a permanent Peace Research Bureau
in Australia, “under the control of a
public body and financed by public
donations.”
This could indeed be a main object of
the Congress, since the Peace movement
in Australia has a habit of changing its
name, whenever its Communist affilia-
tions become too notorious. This may
also be why any link with the World
Peace Council or the 1959 Congress is
so hotly denied. The proposed Peace
Research Bureau could be an ideal new
Communist Front.
SPORT
A Game to Watch
Hockey Tests could be historic
FROM “DISCUS” IN SYDNEY
Pakistan hockey team will play
two Tests against Australia in Mel-
bourne and Sydney this week, and I
suggest that everyone who follows sport
rather than a sport should see one of
these matches if possible. We are used
to seeing the world’s best cricket, rugby
and tennis players in action, and this is
an occasion when hockey can be added
to the list.
It may be an historic occasion, too.
Pakistan won at the Rome Olympics
and is regarded as the top hockey nation.
If Australia wins one of the two Tests,
which is quite likely, then hockey inter-
nationals in Australia will become a
regular thing. Ours would be the team
to beat.
Pakistan’s captain, Manzoor Atif,
says it already is, and his team’s first
defeat of the tour, 0-1 against Western
Australia, made it clear that he was not
merely a polite visitor saying the right
thing. The result should not have sur-
prised anyone. The West fielded seven
Olympic players, and contributes the
most of any State to the Australian team.
If Australia’s star is rising in hockey,
it is not before time. The game began
in Britain in the last century, spread to
Europe, and also from the army fields
of British India to all parts of the sub-
continent. It has been played in Aus-
tralia for most of this century without
much notable international competition
and, so, very little international success.
An ideal school game, it has been left
mainly to the girls.
How silly that notion is has been
demonstrated in Perth and will be again
in Melbourne and Sydney. The Paki-
stanis play a fast, open, tricky game
with a degree of ball control that more
than matches very good soccer. It will
be interesting to see how the Austra-
lians counter this game.
Both teams will leave for Tokyo after
the second Test. In the Olympic
matches, Australia will have plenty of
competition—from India, which reigned
from 1928 to 1956, and from England,
Japan, Germany, USA, New Zealand
and Belgium.
The Australians played reasonably
well in Melbourne in 1956 and in Rome,
but more international competition since
then has sharpened their play. The
strength which exists in Western Austra-
lia, giving the team so many people who
play regularly together, will improve
the team’s chances, and the Tests against
Pakistan, whether Australia wins or
loses them, will improve the team.
The Tests could easily be a preview
of the 1964 Olympic hockey fin a '>
which is the one teams event Australia
has a good chance of winning.

The Three Faces of Labor
Generals who get their ears belted off?
By BLIGH
In April of this year the powerful
secretary of the Australian Workers’
Union, Tom Dougherty, was re-
ported to have asked: “How long would
you keep a general who is always get-
ting the ears belted off him in battle?”
For the ALP the question is just as
relevant as it was then, and no easier to
answer.
The question of who should lead the
party is also the question of where it
should be led, for the backgrounds and
personalities of the leading candidates
represent in microcosm the major social
forces now affecting the labor move-
ment.
In 1891, when the New South Wales
Labor Electoral League put up forty-
five candidates and had an astonishing
thirty-five of them elected, only 4 per
cent of employees belonged to trade
unions. The founders of the Labor
Party, then, were not typical of “the
working class” whatever definition one
uses. Nor were they typical of today's
workers. They hardly could be, since
Australia was then still so predominantly
a primary producing country. Wool and
wheat dominated the economy, with
metal mining important and manufac-
turing confined to light processing in-
dustries like furniture, food and leather-
goods.
The result was that the labor move-
ment of the ’nineties, the period when
the unions created the Labor Party, was
largely a movement of pastoral, mining,
transport and skilled craftsmen. Of
these, the craftsmen tended to be con-
servative. The unions which took part
in the maritime strike of 1890, which
gave the final impetus to ideas of form-
ing Labor parties, were all organisations
of the semi-skilled and unskilled: wharf-
laborers, seamen, stewards and cooks,
trolley and draymen, metal-miners, coal-
miners and shearers. The only “craft”
union involved was the spark which set
the tinder-box alight, the tiny marine
officers’ union. Even the railway strike
of 1917, the strike in which Ben Chifley
lost his seniority and Joe Cahill lost his
job, involved no factory workers. Aus-
tralia was still not an industrialised
country.
A “turn-of-the-century” man
npHE present Leader of the Labor Party,
Arthur Calwell, dates back to this
era. Calwell was born in Victoria in
1896, when the Labor parties were still
commonly regarded as splinters from the
“real” or “major” parties: the Free
Traders and Protectionists. The son of
a policeman, and a Catholic, Calwell
acted true to both characteristics in
joining the public service and the Labor
Party at an early age. By the time his
eighteenth birthday had arrived, he was
secretary of his local branch and he has
since held almost every elective office
the party has to offer. As he himself
has put it, “It was in the affairs of party
management that I received my political
education.”
It comes as something of a shock to
realise that Calwell was secretary of a
Labor Party branch back when Austra-
lia entered the Great War. He is a
turn-of-the-century man, typical of the
best, and worst, in the Labor Party as it
was in its formative years. The best is
a burning nationalism, a cautious, even
conservative, approach to proposals for
change, and a genuine sympathy for the
poor and the oppressed. No one who
has taken the trouble to read his “Labor's
Role in Modern Society” could doubt his
sincerity or worry too much about his
socialism. The first permeates the whole
book, but is best illustrated by a passage
from the preface. “There are few more
searching tests of a person's integrity,”
he writes, “than a Labor Party meeting
in Australia. Sooner or later, our
people discern and reject the poseur,
the mere word-spinner speaking not
from the heart.” As even his bitter
political opponents concede, Calwell is
one who speaks from the heart. The
proof is in the enormous personal affec-
tion he inspires among his followers.
His socialism is not so well-loved as
the man. Calwell entered the ALP
several years before the socialisation
objective was adopted, and rode with the
party through the original syndicalist
version, the 1927 excision of all traces
of syndicalism, the 1953 preamble’s
definition in terms of social justice, and
the 1957 definition in terms of demo-
cratic socialism. If the gloss to be
placed on the objective changes again
—nothing is surer —Calwell will stay
with the party. This is not because he
is either cynical or dishonest, but because
for him socialism will always be an
ideal and this year’s policies will be what
is possible. The important considera-
tion is the unity of the labor movement.
As late as July this year he astonished

a naive, young television reporter by
denying that the Victorian ALP Con-
ference was split on matters of prin-
ciple. And he really meant it. “I have
no time for the spurious distinctions
drawn between so-called Right-wingers
and Left-wingers ... I judge no Labor
man in these terms. I ask only that he
should loyally abide by the majority
decision once that decision is made, no
matter how strenuously he may have
opposed it or sought to alter it.”
Not all Labor men so generously
accept the right of others to differ, par-
ticularly on matters so important as what
constitutes socialism. When Calwell
chose in his policy speech of 1961 to
promise that a Labor Government would
not raise the question of nationalisation
in the lifetime of the 24th Parliament,
there were rumblings of discontent
among the radicals. He hardly mended
matters when he later went on to claim
that the Constitution prevented nationali-
sation, and that the necessary amend-
ments could not then be carried. At
the time, the Menzies Government was
experiencing some difficulty in avoiding
taking over more and more of the
economy.
The “long-hairs”
TTowever, his attitude was pure turn-of-
A the-century Labor. The extraordinary
thing about Calwell's book is how much
like ‘'Billy” Hughes’ “Case for Labor”
it is, although Hughes wrote in 1911,
before Calwell had even joined the
party. Unfortunately, Calwell also shows
the other side of the early Labor Party:
the xenophobia, the suspicion of the
educated, and the inability to pursue
even principles which he devoutly sup-
ports when his emotions are strongly
engaged.
The xenophobia is political rather than
personal. He is very friendly with the
Chinese community in Australia, and
has taken the trouble to learn Mandarin,
yet he is absolutely inflexible on the
White Australia policy. He earned a
good deal of public odium for his rigid
administration while Minister for Immi-
gration in the Chifley Government, and
did nothing to help by cracking about
the case of a Chinese called Wong that
“Two Wongs don't make a white”.
The anti-intellectualism comes out
whenever the “long-hairs” try to run
his beloved Labor Party. At the 1960
NSW ALP Conference he shocked many
people, including the newly arrived
Cyril Wyndham, by his savage attack
on intellectuals and he has several times
pleaded for more old-style trade union
leaders to take a prominent part in the
party.
Perhaps more disturbing than either to
party members who place a good deal of
emphasis on individual rights and the
rule of law is Calwell’s tendency to

Why did Hanimex add
that ‘F’ to Praktica IV?
For Fresnal, firstly.
That’s the name of the optical genius responsible for
the latest modifications to Praktica. The same sort of
genius that has developed German automobiles to their
present stage of perfection. Mr. ‘F’ has invented a
new kind of grooved screen view-finder. When you use
it, you’ll see how it concentrates all of the available
light to give a much brighter, sharper picture.
We could have called it a IVFF, actually, because we’ve
also added a new fingertip controlled split-image
range-finder.
This gives the Praktica IVF two new features:
(1) Fresnal screen view-finder.
(2) Fingertip controlled split-image range-finder.
Add these to the excellence of the Praktica IV and to
its fully automatic lenses, its most flexible range of
accessories, its fantastic Hanimex world-wide warranty,
and the finest of service ... and this justly famous
35 mm. camera is worth more than an initial ‘F.’
The Praktica is a single lens reflex camera with fully
interchangeable lenses. Praktica offers these features
at only a little more cost than simple range-finder
cameras.
Here are the three models:
Praktica IVF with Meyer Domiplan Lens.
This quality f2.8/50 mm. 4-element automatic lens is
hard coated and colour corrected. The automatic dia-
phragm opens and closes as the shutter is released
and the film transported to the next frame. Price . . .
£39/19/B.
Praktica IVF with Zeiss Tessar Lens.
This famous f2.8/50 mm. lens is fitted.with a depth of
field preview button and fully automatic diaphragm.
Price . . . £49/19/6.
Praktica IVF with Zeiss Pancolor Lens.
This 6-element f2/58 mm. lens is the finest of its type
in the world—has every modern optical innovation
incorporated, to give the maximum results under all
light conditions. Price . . . £59/19/6.
Praktica.offers you the largest range of interchangeable
lenses and accessories in the world. It’s worth a fast
trip to your friendly photographic dealer, who will tell
you a lot more about Praktica and demonstrate every
outstanding feature.
Or, if you prefer, write Hanimex for free literature.

Photography,” is also available from Hanimex dealers

arbitrary action. It showed in his
attempt, during the Second World War,
to ban the newspapers who flouted his
authority, and it showed again in 1955,
when Ray Fitzpatrick and Frank
Browne were brought to the Bar of
the House of Representatives to answer
a charge of contempt of Parliament.
Browne had maligned many Members
of Parliament in a confidential news-
sheet he published, but Calwell distin-
guished himself by the virulence of his
language. Under protection of Parlia-
mentary privilege, he called Fitzpatrick
“just an illiterate lout, just a stand-over
bully who has made his money by cor-
ruption”, and Browne “an arrogant rat,
just a character assassin”.
Calwell, then, is the old school.
Honest, tough and emotional; a clerk
who fought his way up the ladder pro-
vided by the. labor movement; a battler
who still carries the scars of a hundred
fights as his bona fides. His two main
rivals are very different. He might well
have had them in mind when he wrote
that to be a politician requires a long and
hard apprenticeship. “Politics is not a
career for the talented dilettante.”
A natural for TV
rp H E most likely successor is Gough
Whitlam, the Deputy Leader.
Twenty years Calwell’s junior, he belongs
to a different agei In 1945, when he
joined the ALP, it had already under-
gone one revolution and was about to
begin another. Between the wars Aus-
tralia had taken off into industrialisation,
and the hitherto dominant Australian
Workers’ Union had gradually lost
ground to the unions of factory workers.
In 1927 the ACTU had been formed, in
large part as the industrial expression of
these newly important unions, but their
rise also affected the ALP. It showed in
the syndicalism and internationalism of
the 'twenties and in the socialisation
units of the ’thirties; most of all, it
showed in the fantastic rise and fall of
Jack Lang, a demagogue, but one who
recognised, and for a while rode, the
industrial tiger.
When Whitlam joined the party it
was on the threshold of a new change—
the white collar explosion. The change
was most marked in the electorate
generally, for by the ’sixties white collar
workers substantially outnumbered
manual workers; it was this dramatic
reversal of numbers which laid the foun-
dations for the Libera] Party's post-war
flowering. But it was marked even
among the unions themselves. Despite the
fact that white collar workers were no-
toriously harder to unionise than manual
workers, they grew' from a quarter of all
trade unionists in 1945 to nearly 40 per
cent in the ’sixties.
Whitlam finds it easy to appeal to the
desk-bound, the bank clerks, public ser-

vants, professional men and the rest, in
a way that Calwell never could. He is
so much one of them. Tall, good-
looking, well-tailored and cultivated in
speech, he is a natural for television.
Calwell's rough-hewn features and
curiously grating voice obscure the sin-
cerity his personal presence conveys.
Whitlam’s post-election comment that
“Mr Calwell did not speak or act as
impressively as Sir Robert Menzies”
must have seemed a deliberate jibe to
the older man.
The Deputy Leader's background is
very much middle class. Unlike Calwell,
whose origins made even his secondary
education something of an achievement,
Whitlam began his education at Knox
Grammar and went as a matter of course
to Sydney University, where he gradua-
ted in Arts in 1938. During the war
he served in the South-West Pacific as a
navigator and emerged as a Flight-
Lieutenant; he is one of the few Labor
members to have held commissioned
rank. After the war he graduated in
Law and was admitted to the Bar in
1947.
“Goof*
TTis father, H. F. L. Whitlam, had a
career of some distinction, serving as
Commonwealth Crown Solicitor and as
Australian representative on the UN
Human Rights Commission, and his wife
is the daughter of Mr Justice Dovey of
the NSW Supreme Court. His sister is
the Principal of PLC, Croydon, a good
private girls’ school in Sydney. Un-
doubtedly both birth and marriage have
helped Whitlam's career. He would, in
fact, have been welcomed as a candidate
for the Liberal Party. But his rise in the
ALP still depended on ability and
catching the eye of the men in control of
the machine.
He got his chance to show ability in
1952, when he won the by-election for
Werriwa, on the western fringes of Syd-
ney. At first he ran in harness with the
radicals, with the late Eddie Ward and
Les Haylen, and he backed Dr Evatt
against the Groupers. However, after
the split in the Labor Party he was taken
up by Senator Kennelly, known as the
‘’Kingmaker”, and other middle-of-the-
road men of influence in the party, and
in 1960 won the Deputy Leadership. He
also won the enmity of Haylen and
others in the orbit of Jack Lang's “Cen-
tury” which ceaselessly lampoons him
as “Goof” Whitlam. Apparently the
attacks hurt, for in April, 1960, he made
the mistake of writing to the Prime
Minister to complain about the use of
members’ rooms by one of the “Century”
group, Dr Evatt's former secretary, Alan
Dalziel. It was a blunder and cost him
some prestige in the party, which does

not take kindly to such action outside
its own framework.
Lately he has been very much ad-
mired and supported by the powerful
controllers of the NSW ALP Executive,
in particular by big “Charlie” Oliver,
State secretary of the AWU, president
of the NSW party, and the key man in
that State. They see him as the sort of
candidate the Labor Party now needs:
educated, able, personally charming and
capable of making a case without too
much tub-thumping. He is a man who
has enough ability to recognise his own
shortcomings and arrange for men
around him to fill them, a man who will
be well grounded in some fields —South-
East Asia has been one of his strengths
—and can take a brief on others. He is
a man with whom the white collar types
can identify.
The radicals worry about his socialism.
It certainly is not of the evangelical
kind. His public statements are mildly
Gaitskellite and he is inclined to admit
that private enterprise has some achieve-
ments to its credit. In the United States
recently he wrote that “The Australian
Labor Party sees the shortcomings of
capitalism today as ones of omission
rather than commission, of not being
sufficiently enterprising and independent.
It sees the dynamic role which socialism
must play in a skilled and affluent com-
munity inhabiting a remote, dependent
and unevenly developed continent.”
On the other hand, Whitlam is radi-
cal in areas where Calwell is not. He
comes out strongly for increased defence
expenditure, leans heavily towards the
American alliance, and has a lawyer's
concern for due process. On the Labor
bogies of White Australia and State Aid
he is distinctly lukewarm, and he has
staked his political future on the ques-
tion of reforming the ALP machine to
give the parliamentarians more freedom.
That these also seem to be the areas in
which the white collar groups are radi-
cal, and the ones in which the Liberal
Party under Sir Robert Menzies has had
such success, is the measure of Whit-
lam's hopes in the future.

joined the ALP in 1947, and only took
an active part in it during the split—
which led to his entry into Parliament in
1955. Both men are occasionally whis-
pered about by the old guard because
they did not go through that “long
apprenticeship” that Calwell considers so
essential. There is a similarity, too, in
their good looks both are usu-
ally written about as “handsome” and
“photogenic”—and in their tertiary edu-
cation. In a party which even in 1949
had 47 per cent of its parliamentarians
educated only to primary level, Cairns
—like Dr Evatt—is regarded as brilliant.
There the similarity ends. Cairns’
background was every bit as difficult
as Calwell's. His father, a clerk, was
killed in the Great War and the boy
never knew him. His mother struggled,
working as a cook, to support him and
he left school at the Intermediate level.
It was only after several years in the
police force, and after encouragement
from one-time Victorian Police Com-
missioner the late Sir Thomas Blarney,
that Cairns plodded on to a university
degree in commerce, taken in the even-
ing. Later he added a master’s degree
and a doctorate, sandwiched in a year at
Oxford, and returned to teach economic
history at Melbourne University.
He does not himself expect ever to
become Leader. “Look through the his-
tory books,” he once said, “and you’ll
see that no one far to the Left or Right
has ever made it. You sometimes have
to pay a price for your convictions.”
Lately he has been more optimistic.
At the Victorian ALP Conference in
July he was hailed by cries of “Prime
Minister! Prime Minister!” However,
he is too analytical a politician to be
carried away by this. His basic prob-
lem is a complete refusal to compro-
mise.
For this reason he is the darling of
the radicals, both those wanting to make
sweeping changes in the traditional
sphere of public ownership and those
who want to alter the White Australia
policy, espouse nuclear disarmament and
so on. His approach is ideological. He
figures prominently in the Victorian
Fabian Society, the only really active
Labor ginger group in Australia at pre-
sent, and reads voraciously. Given his
assumptions, he proceeds coolly and by
impeccable logic to his conclusions. The
arguments come when his assumptions
are examined.
For an Australian Labor politician to
read Marx is unusual. For him to ad-
mit publicly that Marx is impressive and
that some of his thinking is based on
Marxism is quite extraordinary. It is
a measure of the quality Cairns has that
he does this. In many ways this in-
transigence appeals to people who, like
himself, have had to battle with the
pressures of a conformist society. But
his conclusions scare off many of the
white collar supporters he might other-
wise hope to attract; they lead him to use
terms like “property system'’ and to
speak of those who owned and served
this system as opposed to those who did
not, phrases which send a warning tingle
down the spine of those who have also
read the Communist literature.
He is respected, but not liked, by
the Liberals. He is too capable, too
unlaughing, too dedicated to be a com-
fortable opponent. The permanent anti-
communists, such as W. C. Wentworth
and John Jess, attack him as “the lover
boy of the Communist Press”, but he hits
back equally hard himself. Even the
Prime Minister unbends to have a jab
at Cairns. He is also respected, but not
always liked, within the ALP itself.
Despite his respectably working class
background, his capacity, and his dedi-
cation, he is often regarded as “a cold
fish”. It is the same price Whitlam
pays in being regarded as “smarty pants”.
They are both breaking new paths in
a party which has more resistance to
change than any other in this country.


OUT AND ABOUT
A Long Love Affair
As much part of folklore as Ned Kelly, Phar Lap and Don Bradman
By GEOFFREY SCOTT
UT’ve had a lovely career,” said
I Gladys Moncrieff, settling back
comfortably in her armchair and
easing one foot out of its shoe. “But
it’s nice not to have to sing any more.
I’m really enjoying life now. No more
dieting, no more worrying about my
voice—l used to get bronchitis nearly
every year, you know, and be off for
a fortnight at a time. No more stage-
fright. You may not believe it, but
even after thousands of performances in
‘The Maid of the Mountains’ I still used
to say my lines over and over again and
pray that everything would be all right
before the curtain went up.
“Now I can just relax. Everyone
ought to relax when they get to my age.
I'm 73, by the way, and I don't mind
saying so now.”
Our Glad certainly does not look 73.
She is still a big, bright-eyed, handsome
woman with the complexion and voice
of someone half her age. She is a very
easy subject to interview. Reminiscences
bubble from her in a constant stream,
though she's a bit hazy about dates and
places. (“That must have been 1914, or
was it 1915? Anyway it was in Sydney,
or Melbourne.”)
“I kept my age dark for a long, long
time,” she said. “You see, for some
time I used to be older than my leading
men and I didn't want young folk in the
audience thinking ‘Poor man, having
to sing with that old girl’. Not much
point in being secretive about it now,
is there?”
She looked with a smile round the
big sitting-room of the Rose Bay house
where she has lived for 40 years. A
grand piano in one corner, deep arm-
chairs and sofa, paintings of the “Maid'’
and “Katinka” on the walls, a wide
window overlooking the Royal Sydney
golf links —a homely, uncluttered room.
“This place has seen some wonderful
parties in its day, my word it has,” Miss
Moncrieff said. “My parties used to be
famous, you know. We packed 60
guests in here sometimes, not only
theatricals but all sorts of people. I
used to love cooking for a crowd. The
piece de resistance was my oyster pie.
It had 70 dozen oysters in it —of course
they were only a shilling a dozen then.
My favorite drink was black velvet —
stout and champagne, heavenly stuff. I
don't drink much now. And I only give
small parties, though I still like cooking
for them.”
I asked her what she thought of
modern musical comedies. “West Side
Story,” for instance?
“Well, I like some of them,” she said.
“I loved ‘Camelot’ when I saw it in
New York —and ‘Oliver’. But it’s a
shame nobody writes like Franz Lehar
and Rudolf Friml any more. Their music
will live forever. I don’t know whether
artists nowadays get as much pleasure as
I did out of the music they have to sing.
“Anyway there’s a different atmo-
sphere about the theatre now, a lot of
the old romance and gaiety seems to
have gone out of it. I remember those
gallery queues! They really made you
feel like a queen. People wouldn't
queue up like that these days. I dare
say they are more sophisticated, or some-
thing. There used to be First Nighter
Clubs, you know, people who would
never miss one of my opening nights. I
still get letters from some of the old
fans. Not as many as there used to be,
of course, but I suppose about 50 a year
or more.
“I think it’s a great pity that audiences
don't dress up as much as they used to.
Artists react to a well-dressed audience,
especially on first nights. It is a compli-
ment to them when people go to the
trouble of getting into formal clothes. I
used to get a great thrill out of seeing
all the beautiful dresses out there in
front. They say formal dress for the
theatre is coming back. I certainly hope
so. The theatre should be a real occa-
sion—not like watching the pictures or
television. Not that I don’t like televi-
sion. I don't go out so much now and
I see a lot of it. ‘The Defenders’ is one
of my favorites and, of course, Danny
Kaye.”
Someone once described Gladys Mon-
crieff's career as a long love affair
between an actress and an entire nation.
Certainly there has never been anyone
quite like Our Glad in Australian thea-
trical history. She made her Sydney
debut before World War I, when she
was touring the suburban houses with a
vaudeville company. She sang the role
of Teresa in “The Maid of the Moun-
tains” for the last time in Perth in 1952,
and made her final stage appearance a
few years later with Harry Wrens
“Many Happy Returns” company in the
town of Hamilton, New Zealand.
“It seemed an odd place to wind up a
career like mine,” Miss Moncrieff said.
“But I'll never forget that last night.
All the other artists stood around
applauding me and the boys of the
ballet took off their coats and threw
them on the stage for me to walk on.
Gladys Moncrieff was born in Bunda-
berg, Queensland. She was attending a
State school in Townsville when her
headmaster discovered The Voice and
gave her the part of Marco in a pupils
production of “The Gondoliers”. After
she left school, her mother got her a

job singing at the Olympic Theatre,
Townsville, for £4 10s. a week.
“I owed everything to my mother for
years,” Miss Moncrieff said. “She had
to push me along all the time. I was
a very timid youngster and would never
have got anywhere on my own. Once
when Melba was visiting Townsville my
mother stopped her in the street and told
her she ought to hear me. Melba just
said ‘l'm singing tonight and mustn’t
talk’ and got back into her carriage.
But Melba did hear me later on, when
Hugh J. Ward asked me to audition at
the Theatre Royal in Sydney. That was
when I was going round the suburban
circuit with J. C. Bain’s Vaudeville
Company. My mother had fixed up a
contract for me when Bain was in
Queensland. I was billed as ‘The White
Balladist’. Nothing to do with the
color of my skin—l used to wear a
white muslin dress with a white ribbon
in my hair and sing the ‘Jewel Song’ from
‘Faust’ and a lot of sentimental ballads.
“Hugh J. Ward spotted me at the old
Coronation Theatre at Bondi Junction,
where Woolworths is now, when he was
talent scouting for J. C. Williamson’s.
I had about a dozen auditions at the
Royal, queuing up with a lot of others,
until one day I was invited alone. There
were only two other people sitting in the
auditorium and, when the lights went up,
I saw they were Ward and Melba. She
came on stage, sat down at the piano
and made me sing scales for her. I
was scared stiff. Then she said to Hugh,
‘You ought to do something about this
kid’, and she told me my future as a
singer was assured. I met Melba again
in London years afterwards but she
didn't remember until I reminded her.”
“The Maid”
Miss Moncrieff’s first contract with
The Firm provided for a salary of
£3 a week for the first year, £5 a week
for the second and £6 for the third. In
1914, after apprenticeship as an under-
study, she graduated from the chorus to
the role of Josephine in “HMS Pina-
fore”. In 1918 came her first big star-
ring role in “Katinka”. Three years
later, in Melbourne on January 21, 1921,
the curtain went up on “The Maid of
the Mountains”. That sweltering sum-
mer's night was an historic date in the
annals of the Australian theatre.
“The Maid” has become as much
part of Australia’s folklore as Ned
Kelly, Phar Lap and Don Bradman. The
first production ran for five months in
Melbourne and spent another two years
travelling round the other capitals. It
transformed Gladys Moncrieff into Our
Glad, the nation’s sweetheart. For a
generation afterwards it seemed to
cynics that whenever The Firm’s bank
balance showed signs of subsidence they
turned for relief to a revival of the
talismanic “Maid”.
“I honestly haven’t any idea how
many times I sang the part of Teresa,”
Miss Moncrieff told me. “I remember
one stage manager counted up to 3000
performances and then gave up. I know
I went through about a dozen Baldas-
sarres” —she ticked them off on her
fingers—“ Frank Freeman (he was the
first), Frank Leighton, Andy McMaster,
Claude Flemming, Lance Fairfax,
Ormond Douglas, Max Oldaker, Roy
Redgrave, and at least three or four
others.
“People used to criticise all those
revivals, but Williamson’s didn't put
them on for my benefit. They knew
the ‘Maid’ was always good box-office,
that's what interested them. Once we
opened a revival in Sydney in the middle
of a tram strike but the theatre was
packed just the same. Anyway I never
got tired of singing the ‘Maid’, it's such
lovely music.”
Apart from seasons in London in
1926-27 and wartime tours to entertain
the troops in New Guinea and Korea,
Gladys Moncrieff's stage career was
confined entirely to Australia. She has
no regrets about that.
“I went to London in 1926 when I
was offered the lead in ‘Riki Tiki’ at
the Gaiety at £2OO a week,” she said.
“I wasn’t really interested in an overseas
career but I just wanted to prove to my-
self that I could make the grade there.
‘Riki Tiki* suffered from a very poor
book and only lasted a couple of weeks.
One night an Australian voice roared
down from the gallery. ‘You’re too good
for this rubbish, Glad!’ I don’t know
about that, but when I took over the
lead in Lehar’s ‘Blue Mazurka’ it ran for
26 weeks. That was good enough for
me. When Ben Fuller asked me to
come back to Australia for ‘Rio Rita’ I
jumped at the chance. I never wanted
to go away again.”
Before her departure for London, Miss
Moncrieff was earning £lBO a week with
The Firm. She had starred in a long
string of revivals and new productions,
including “The Merry Widow”, “The
Southern Maid”, “The Belle of New
York”, “Maytime”, “The Street Singer”
and “The Chocolate Soldier”. “Rio
Rita” ran for two years round the capi-
tal cities after she returned to Australia.
Then, in the early 19305, she and Claude
Flemming appeared in two Australian
musicals, “Collitts Inn” and “The Cedar
Tree”, before she went back to The
Firm in 1936.
In 1938 she was involved in a serious
car accident while motoring from Ade-
laide to Melbourne for an ABC concert
engagement. She spent months in a
Geelong hospital with a fractured leg,
shoulder and wrist. “I had a grand old
time in that hospital,” she said. “I never
ate so well in my life. People used to
send me turkeys, squab and all sorts of
delicacies which I had cooked at a hotel
nearby. The most touching gift was
from a small boy who lent me his comic
books to read. The only trouble was
that the accident left me with one leg
an inch shorter than the other. Look —
She took off her shoes and walked across
the carpet, but I saw no perceptible
difference.
Wasted voice?
“Tt took me a while to get back to
normal again but I was determined
to make it,” she said. “I did mostly radio
work for the ABC and my first live
audience after the smash-up was at the
Ingleburn camp early in 1940, just be-
fore the first lot of boys sailed away.
Then Williamson's revived the ‘Maid’
again in 1942 and the stage manager
told me not to take the heavy fall in the
second act because he was afraid I
might damage myself again. But poor
Teresa went down as usual, and came
up without any broken bones. I sup-
pose I just fell down by instinct, I had
hit the boards so often in the ‘Maid’.”
For years many critics and well-
meaning friends urged Gladys Moncrieff
to study for an operatic career. Her
voice, they said, with its power, perfect
control and remarkable range, was
wasted on the bijouteries of popular
operetta. Besides she had the presence
of a prima 'donna. A bit too jolly-
looking for Brunnhilde, perhaps, but she
might have made a delectable Tosca or
Carmen. I asked her whether she had
ever regretted not listening to their
advice.
“Not a bit,” she said. “Fritz Kreisler
once told me I had a soul in my voice
and ought to be in grand opera. But I
never felt the slightest ambition that
way. I like some of the operas, you
know, like ‘La Boherne’, but I must say
I prefer the lighter music. Anyway I
never fancied sacrificing all the pleasures
of life for a career. I’ve enjoyed my life,
and that’s the main thing, isn’t it?”


OVERSEAS
Irredentist Java
On the March
When does Malaysia hit back?
From DENNIS BLOODWORTH in Singapore
By the beginning of this month the
whole of Southern Malaysia was
like a country under siege. In Sara-
wak and Sabah some 10,000 troops of
the Anglo-Malaysian security forces were
defending a 960-mile long frontier
against incursions by Indonesian terror-
ists.
In Johore, Gurkha and New Zealand
battalions were following up remnants of
about 100 regular Indonesian troops and
armed Malaysian infiltrators who had
landed by sea last month, and nearly 40
parachutists dropped from an Indonesian
Air Force transport plane on September
3.
Two battalions of the Malay Regiment
relieved by these Commonwealth units
moved into Singapore to help quell
bloody riots instigated by Indonesian
agents, in which 13 died and 100 more
had to be taken to hospital. Finally the
Malaysian Head of State proclaimed the
entire Federation a security area in which
a man could be executed for carrying
illegal arms or gaoled for 10 years merely
for withholding information.
This is a condition of violence and
confusion imposed by the giant Republic
of Indonesia on a weak young Common-
wealth State one year old this month
with its mixed population of only
10,000,000 Malays, Chinese and Indians,
and its small defensive professional army
of fewer than 12 infantry battalions.
The Indonesians have no intention of
fighting a conventional war against Ma-
laysia. Their agents are paying hooligans
in Singapore to stir up racial strife and
they are smuggling Left-wing malcon-
tents and political opponents of Tunku
Abdul Rahman, the Malaysian Premier,
to camps in Sumatra for combat train-
ing. They are then shipping or parachut-
ing them back into this country to guide
Indonesian regulars briefed to set up
guerrilla bases to panic the population
with acts of sabotage or foment rebellion
with false rumors and undercover poli-
tical agitation.
Djakarta is plotting to detonate an in-
ternal revolt here whose explosive ele-
ments will include the 500 Communist
terrorists along the Thai border the
unsavory left-overs from Malaya’s 12-
year anti-Communist emergency, pro-
Indonesian dissidents in the fiercely Mus-
lim Islamic Party and Peninsula Malay
union, and Left-wing Chinese of Singa-
pore and Sarawak who can be persuaded
that Malaysia is a “neo-colonialist” pup-
pet of Britain which their States have
been hoodwinked into joining.
President Soekarno of Indonesia has
organised a snowball offensive in which
regular troops are often disguised as
volunteers and mixed with Malaysian
traitors in jungle green or shirts and
slacks. Girl parachutists with three
months’ training, drawn from a pool of
50 disgruntled females who were recently
passed out in Java, are pitched into Ma-
laya among the terrorists. All are told
that when they land they will be wel-
comed with open arms by locals already
seething with insurrection. They discover
the truth too late.
After a series of unconvincing denials
in high places, General Abdul Haris
Nasution. the Indonesian Defence Mini-
ster, has admitted that Djakarta has been
filtering Indonesians and Malaysians into
North Borneo and Malaya by air and sea
“for quite a long time”. Malaysian secu-
rity forces have taken uniformed Indo-
nesian regular soldiers prisoner in Johore
as well as Borneo and have accumulated
a wealth of evidence in weapons and
equipment to back their Government's
accusation before the Security Council
that Indonesia has committed open ag-
gression.
It would be naive, however, to imag-
ine that this will range the world on
Malaysia’s side. Indonesia has ostensibly
undertaken an insidious campaign to
undermine the Federation in her role of
self-righteous champion of the anti-im-
perialist Afro-Asian bloc, bent upon
“crushing Malaysia” as the base of a
“British neo-colonialist plot to encircle”
Indonesia. For this Soekarno may expect
the plaudits of many new countries auto-
matically prejudiced against the West
and the whites.
Soekarno is, in fact, motivated by two
fears and two ambitions. He is afraid
that prosperous go-ahead Malaysia may
lure away from the overcrowded central
Indonesian island of Java (from which
he comes) the rich outer islands on
which his penurious, mismanaged Re-
public depends for most of its revenue.
Malayans are closely related to Suma-
trans, for example, and sympathised with
the Sumatra and Celebes rebels that re-
volted against the Left-wing Javanese
hegemony in 1958. For Soekarno, Ma-
laysia succeeds in being an actively sub-
versive force simply by existing at all.
He feels he must smash it up and destroy
its dangerous economic wellbeing.

Strong, light, bright! Aluminium cooks quickly, evenly.
‘Hot Spots’ occur in cooking utensils made of
metals with poor heat conductivity. The heat
from the stove ’stays put' instead of spreading.
The result? Burnt food. But aluminium spreads
heat smoothly and evenly makes cooking
easier and quicker. The same high conductivity
(combined with lightness and resistance to cor-
rosion) is the reason why the sole-plate of the
modern iron is made from aluminium.
The high heat conductivity of aluminium means
that it also cools with remarkable speed an
advantage in many applications. In the motor
car, aluminium brake drums speedily dissipate
the heat of friction, preventing dangerous brake
fading. Similarly, aluminium engine blocks mean
cooler running and higher performance. Jet
engines, air-conditioners and refrigerators are all
made more efficient by the ability of aluminium
to shed heat quickly.
In electronic applications, aluminium ‘heat sinks’
or ‘heat exchangers’ are employed special
aluminium shapes which either dissipate exces-
sive heat or transfer it to points where it is
needed. Paradoxically, aluminium reflects heat—
as it does light. It also conducts electricity and
is non-magnetic, non-toxic, and impact absorbing.
It is less costly than other non-ferrous metals,
and is available in every form known to the
metal-working industry. Aluminium has a wider
range of finishes than any other metal, providing

Union within the Afro-Asian bloc, Soe-
karno also fears that the Chinese as a
race will dominate “Malay ’ South-East
Asia. He, therefore, sees Malaysia as a
first-class risk on his own doorstep, for 43
per cent of Malaysians are Chinese, and
only 40 per cent Malays.
These offbeat yet comprehensible fears
are matched by his ambitions. After the
glorious Sumatran and Javanese king-
doms of the falsely glittering past (neither
of which included all of present day
Indonesia but both of which held sway
over much of Malaysia), Soekarno wishes
to create a third —even greater empire.
Javanese irredentism at its grossest
hungers not only after Malaysia, but
also the Philippines, part of Thailand and
even distant Madagascar. Furthermore,
Soekarno wants to be the leader of the
“uncommitted” nations of Latin America,
Africa and Asia, whose shibboleth is
often militant anti-imperialism.
To these yearnings must be added the
fact that “confrontation” serves to dis-
tract the masses from misery at home
and placate the 2,000,000-strong Indo-
nesian Communist Party. There are in-
herent weaknesses in Soekarno’s position.
The Indonesian economy has been criti-
cally enfeebled. The superficially power-
ful Indonesian armed forces are backed
by no comparable arms industry or
know-how, and are heavily dependent
on the Russians.
Relations between Djakarta and
Moscow remain delicate, for the Indo-
nesians side with Peking in the Sino-
Soviet quarrel. Peking has offered Indo-
nesia the usual support of “seven hun-
dred million Chinese” in case of Amer-
ican aggression—a resounding figure that
covers up an inability to do anything
of practical importance. Malaysia has
her own problems, however. Soekarno’s
potential for making mischief and sowing
confusion is almost limitless, for it takes
large security forces to contain and flush
out the small groups of jungle terrorists
that the Indonesians can sprinkle
throughout the country as a focus for
internal rebellion. The Malaysian and
Commonwealth forces are already
stretched, and if Djakarta sends over
many more gangs it may prove impos-
sible to hold the enemy without hitting
back at him on his own territory.
One Malaysian minister has already
said that if the Russians veto Malaysia’s
complaint against Indonesia in the
Security Council “we are to give notice
to the Council that we are going to take
action outside it to stop further aggres-
sion by Indonesia”.
Given Soekarno’s ill-will, negotiation
seems useless. Malaysia will sooner or
later be driven to committing an open
act of war against Indonesia in order to
survive at all, unless the free world
rallies solidly to her defence, (ofns)
The Curious Behavior
of General Khanh
When Taylor plays tennis with Minh
From GODFREY HODGSON in Washington
Almost the only specific new pro-
posal for South Vietnam under
discussion here now is of such a
kind that it could not possibly have any
effect until long after the American
Presidential election.
The idea, proposed in a secret study
commissioned by the Government and
now under top level consideration, is that
the war effort cannot thrive so long as
successive governments in Saigon are
threatened by the existence of a mass of
unruly and alienated but politically-
sophisticated people in the capital, espe-
cially students from which riot mobs are
drawn.
Unemployment, the study estimates, is
40 per cent. In Saigon, the city poor
have benefited far less than the peasants
from the massive flow of American aid.
The new idea would be to spend money
on schools, youth groups, and welfare
in Saigon in the hope of dividends of
political stability. But this is regarded
as a counsel of despair. Washington
now seriously doubts the ability of South
Vietnam to produce any government
capable of winning the war. The
Americans still like General Nguyen
Khanh as the best Prime Minister the
country has got, but they have been
appalled by his flaccid handling of the
political situation.
In public, however, the Administra-
tion's spokesmen are still sanguine about
Khanh’s ability to defeat the rebel Viet-
cong. They are compelled to talk in
this way, because to talk in any other
would be to hand a devastating election
issue to Senator Goldwater. As it is,
Goldwater seems to be feeling his way:
he is simultaneously attacking the
Government for not winning in Vietnam
—and for fighting at all. The essence
of the Administration’s policy is still
what it has been for three years: to give
the South Vietnamese Government every
possible help so that the South Viet-
namese can themselves defeat the Viet-
cong.
In spite of everything, the Administra-
tion remains convinced that this policy
is the best one possible. It still has no
intention whatsoever, in spite of all that
has been written to the contrary, of try-
ing to negotiate a settlement with the
North Vietnamese as soon as the election
is over. The simple truth is that none
of the highest officials here can see any
chance of a settlement which would not
be tantamount to a surrender, and there-
fore far worse than the admittedly
gloomy status quo.
General Taylor, the American Ambas-
sador in Saigon, who has been com-
pelled to take a bigger and better part
in advising Khanh, has reported to
Washington that General Khanh seems
obsessed by the idea that the Americans
want General Minh, the leader whom he
himself had succeeded, to take over. In
vain Taylor protested repeatedly that he
just liked to play tennis with Minh. The
episode shook Washington.
It is thought here that Khanh’s curious
behavior is explained by his jealousy of
Minh: his disastrous essay in personal
government seems to have been in-
tended as a manoeuvre against Minh.
He is said to think of himself playing
de Gaulle to Minh's Pompidou—an
interesting illustration of the problems
for Americans dealing with Asians who
think of themselves as Frenchmen.
Minh is thought not to have ambitions
for himself. But he is known to be
deeply angry about the mysterious death,
at the time Khanh took power, of a cer-
tain personal aide of his, Major Nhung,
who is thought to have been the mur-
derer of President Diem and his brother
last year.
HThe murder of Nhung was one of
several hints that the Can Lao, the
secret society of the followers of Diem,
were working themselves back into
clandestine influence over Khanh.
American Intelligence believes, for
example, that Khanh’s plans for personal
government were actually drafted in
haste by several members of the Can
Lao. It was such signs that the Catho-
lics, who had fallen with Diem, were
on their way back to power which
alarmed the Buddhist leaders and led
them to unleash the riots which forced
Khanh to abdicate his personal power.
Faced with Khanh's floundering, and
a rising tide of rivalry between Catholics
and Buddhists, and the continuing divi-
sions in the small political elite on which
American hopes for Vietnam must rest,
officials here privately cannot conceal
near-despair. The immediate fear is
that the Vietcong, which has been lying
low, presumably to avoid recementing the
warring factions on the other side, might
go over to the attack and produce a col-
lapse before the US election, (ofns)


Giving Grivas a Good
Run for His Money
Vanity, ruthlessness, single-mindedness
By SIR HUGH FOOT, former Governor of Cyprus
6i 4 nyone who understands the
/\ Cyprus situation has been mis-
informed.” So we used to say
way back in the bad days of 1958 when
we thought that the situation could not
be more confused —or more dangerous.
Since violence started again last Christ-
mas, events have shown that we were
wrong. Confusion is now much worse
confounded, and the dangers widen.
And yet, with all its complications,
the main issues are simple enough. When
I went back to Cyprus as Governor in
1957 there were three runners in the
race—(l) Union with Greece (Enosis),
(2) Partition, and (3) Independence
(then an outsider).
I backed Independence. So did
everyone else by August, 1960, when
I shook hands with Archbishop Makarios
and Dr Kutchuk and sailed away on
Cyprus Independence Day. We thought
the race was as good as won.
But now, with the stakes much higher,
the three horses race again. Inde-
pendence is still in the race. So is Parti-
tion. Neither is running well. Enosis
now edges into the lead, strongly backed
by the Americans.
And the jockeys? Makarios is mounted
on Independence. Denktash (the second-
in-command of the Turkish Cypriots,
who from the first was determined to
wreck agreement), has been riding Parti-
tion. And riding Enosis we now see
again the diminutive figure of Grivas.
When Grivas left Cyprus in 1959 he
had failed. Both Enosis and Partition
were out of the race —or so we thought
—both eliminated by treaties signed by
everyone, including Great Britain,
Greece and Turkey, and Makarios and
Kutchuk, too. And Grivas, having been
secretly hustled out of Cyprus, was
rather a pathetic figure in retirement in
his Athens suburb, fanatically brave, of
course, to many Greeks still a romantic
hero, but politically bankrupt—a vain,
angry man at loggerheads with everyone,
including Makarios and the Greek
Government.
New readers begin here.
Now Grivas rides again, and he rides
in the colors of Charles Foley, who has
“edited” his memoirs.* The writing is
mainly Foley's. Grivas’s shrill boasts
and threats come through in some of
the quotations.
But the main story is written with
the ease and skill of the former foreign
editor of the ‘‘Daily Express”.
In the years before Independence
Charles Foley was editor of the “Times
of Cyprus”, one of the two English-
language newspapers then operating in
Cyprus. It was no accident that he was
the only non-Cypriot correspondent to
see Grivas before he left Cyprus. Foley’s
defence of Eoka infuriated many people.
But, while many detested him, no one
doubted his skill as a journalist.
The book he has now written is a
brilliant account of Grivas’s extraordi-
nary exploits. He presents his hero in
the most favorable possible light, he
makes the best of every aspect of the
story, he cleverly selects his material, but
nevertheless he succeeds in drawing a
complete and convincing picture. No
one could have given Grivas a better
run for his money.
There are many vain boasts, many
wild inaccuracies, many ridiculously
biased judgments in the book. But these
come from Grivas. It would have been
a false representation of the man without
them. And, strangely, the total picture
is, I think, a true and honest one.
The combination and the contrast of
the smooth Foley manner and the bom-
bastic interjections of Grivas are ex-
tremely effective. Foley has done his
last and best service to Eoka. More
than that, by giving a vivid picture of
the Eoka leader, as no one else could
have done, he has made a contribution
to understanding the recent history of
Cyprus, and the future prospects of the
island, too.
Grivas’s most obvious qualities, apart
from his fearlessness and single-
mindedness which no one will doubt,
were ruthlessness and vanity. This is the
way he talks:—
At 6 p.m. they saw a Briton water-
ing his garden with a hose. Pavlou
walked up to the garden wall and
shot him once at close range; then,
as he screamed and fell, fired three
more shots into the body and escaped
... I sent my congratulations on this
attack.
And as for vanity:—
I must here confess that whenever
my life, and thus the fate of the
Organisation, depended on a rapid
decision under pressure of events, the
steps I took were later proved to be
correct; and today I wonder how it
was possible for one man ... to make
decisions which were so consistently
right. I cannot believe that ... it was
solely my personal abilities which
brought me success and supplied me
always with correct decisions: this I
ascribe rather to divine providence.
And the vanity led to political blind-
ness. He believed that violence alone

could win. He misjudged every political
issue. He blandly ignored the Turkish
threat. He completely failed to see the
advantages to his own people of the
Radcliffe constitution, for instance. He
refused all advice from his own side
that his economic boycott of British
goods could do Eoka no good. He had
no conception of the international issues
involved, and he did not understand
what was going on at the United
Nations.
Listen to these three boasts: —
At that time (1955) the British gar-
rison amounted to about 4000 men,
mainly raw conscripts, and with 500
trained and properly armed men I
could have driven them into the sea.
If the Greek Government showed
more courage, there would be no
Turkish problem.
If I had been solely responsible for
handling the Cyprus question a solu-
tion would have been found at once.
But as a guerrilla leader, as an orga-
niser of subversive violence, and in his
capacity to plan and execute a campaign
of sabotage and assassination we have
much to learn from him.
“Brains, subtlety and good planning in
an underground movement can defeat
any odds,” he says. “One does not use
a tank to catch field mice a cat will
do the job better. The Field-Marshal’s
only hope of finding us was to play cat
and mouse; to use tiny expertly trained
groups who could with cunning and
patience strike rapidly when we least
expected.”
Subversive warfare will no doubt play
an increasingly important part in the
world in future —particularly in Africa
and Asia, and in understanding its
methods we should learn lessons from
Grivas. His “Preparatory General Plan”
of rebellion, drawn up, so he claims, two
years before violence started in Cyprus,
is as good a first guide to subversive
methods as one could find.
Grivas described me as “a cunning
and dangerous diplomat who is trying to
win the people over and estrange them
from Eoka.” I acknowledge the com-
pliment. I return it by saying that,
while as a politician he is a public
menace, he showed himself in the cruel
and destructive methods of underground
warfare to be a master of the art.
Charles Foley has done us all a
service by giving us a spitting image of
the little man who looks like a cross
between Groucho Marx and Adolf
Hitler, who has done more than any-
one else to create the dangers now
existing in Cyprus and who has not, I
fear, exhausted his capacity to drag his
people through hate and violence to
disaster.

Canada’s Royal Tour
The Queen and a “second Dallas ”?
From a MONTREAL Correspondent
This bilingual city of two million
people is bracing itself for further
terrorism by the separatist under-
ground movement after a week of vio-
lence and threats.
Some responsible observers feel the
terrorist problem has become so serious
that careful consideration should be
given to cancelling the Royal visit, which
is due to begin on October 6.
But the Prime Minister, Mr Lester
Pearson, insists that Her Majesty will be
safe and has decried “extreme publicity”,
of which a “Toronto Telegram” colum-
nist's reference to the possibility of “a
second Dallas” is a good example.
It would be politically unwise for the
Government to cancel the visit. It would
be accused of surrendering to extremist
pressure and of conceding that the situa-
tion had got out of hand.
Apprehension about the Royal visit is
based on a chain of developments which
indicates that the situation has deterio-
rated since last summer, when youths
began dropping bombs in mailboxes and
tried to derail a train carrying Mr Die-
fenbaker to a political meeting.
There is some evidence that experi-
enced revolutionaries from Eastern
Europe and Algeria are directing terrorist
raids. Recent events include the killing
of two civilians in an abortive terrorist
raid on an arms company the most
serious incident so far.
Five alleged members of the Quebec
Revolutionary Army the newest of the
underground factions were charged
with capital murder last week and seven
others were charged with being accom-
plices. During the raid the police, for
the first time, exchanged fire with the
terrorists.
The president of the biggest legal sepa-
ratist party, the Rassemblement pour
V Independence Nationale (RIN), has
announced that it will stage a mass pro-
test rally in Quebec City on the eve of
the Queen’s arrival on October 9. The
party claims to have 15,000 signatures on
a petition against the visit. The target is
100,000 signatures.
Evidence that there is a serious clash
of opinion among the leaders of the RIN,
which claims to have 7000 members,
came to light the day before the arms
raid when seven ranking executives re-
signed. They claimed the party had been
captured by “a faction which is leading
it more and more into an irreversible
policy of revolution”. Other moderates
are expected to quit the party soon.

Around Melbourne
FOR TOURISTS: PIES, HARES, AND CAST-IRON
TTnquestionably our most interest-
ing correspondence continues to
come from the United States Travel
Service. We have just received a note
about the new 45-day Alaskan tour.
Highlights of the trip include a pow-
wow with Eskimos at Fairbanks;
panning for gold at one-degree below
at Discovery Mine, Cripple Creek,
followed by an evening visit to the
Malamute saloon for readings of
Robert W. Service poetry, including
“The Cremation of Sam McGee”;
flight across the Arctic Circle to
Kotzebue, Alaska’s second - largest
Eskimo village, for dog-sled rides; a
four-day hunt for moose, caribou and
grizzly bear; and an evening visit to
Juneau’s Red Dog saloon.
This, to your pioneer, was intensely
revealing. Australia’s total tourist
traffic this year is expected to be a
trifling 160,000. And how many of
these come on to Melbourne? For
some time it’s been all too obvious
that many of our best hotels rarely
are more than 50 per cent occupied.
Therefore Batman has agreed to
take over tourism for this city, and
he has guaranteed to increase the
flow tenfold within 12 months. One
of the major attractions would be the
seven-day “Folk Tour”, in which for
the first time the tourists would really
meet the people and learn to under-
stand Melburnians. It could start
with a stop-work meeting at the Mal-
vern tram depot. At the depot the
Tramways Employees’ Union would
be only too happy to arrange two
sessions daily.
Don’t worry too much about a
football match; the tourists would
never understand the game. Far
better would be to listen to Alan
Killigrew, coach of North Melbourne,
during his half-time harangue. Visitors
would particularly like the last
moments of the oration when his
voice sinks to a whisper: “All right,
I can’t tell you how to win, I can’t
put blood in your heart, I can’t push
the blood through to work your
muscles. HEART IS SOMETHING
YOU GOTTA HAVE ON YOUR
OWN . . . !”
Then, to get an intimate under-
standing of our mores, they should
know something of our great national
diet. For example, many people
believe that right here in Melbourne
we have the world’s most marvellous
pie-making machine. The tour should,
of course, go out to the Ascot Vale
factory and see this machine in full
surge, pumping out 1200 dozen pies
an hour.
There are technical difficulties yet
to be solved on how to show the tour
the color of Melburnian pubs at 5.55
p.m. How hard it would be to keep
track of members in the crush, but
we certainly plan to include a pow-
wow with a good cross-section of
local citizens, say a rover, a ruckman
and a wingman at Lou Richards’
Phoenix saloon. Then, for the benefit
of those in the party equipped with
tape recorders, we would turn on that
most haunting, most Australian of all
sounds —the wheeeeeeeeee of the tap-
ping of an 18-gallon Fosters keg.
We would like to take them out
to Flemington in the early dawn to
see the track gallops. We would equip
every member with a stop-watch.
They would sit on the grass and enjoy
the excitement of it all.
/Drizzly bear hunting is jolly hard to
turn on in these parts. However,
for a jaunt that is unique we could
turn on the four-day Victorian live
hare coursing trip. This would
include visits to Victorian tracks
where live hares are used, with the
hare ultimately being torn to pieces
by the greyhounds.
There would be gold prospecting
trips to the Upper Yarra, all tourists
being equipped with bowyangs, broad
hat and prospecting dish. We would
have the Percy Cerutty tour with full
opportunities to photograph Percy,
and special runs up the Portsea sand-
hills. Actually we might have to move
those sandhills. It would be more
convenient to have them at St Kilda.
As for the appearance of Mel-
bourne, we should at all costs en-
courage the “Victoriana” look. We
want all Carlton, Brunswick and East
Melbourne to be decked out in lash-
ings of cast-iron balconies. Many of
the old places foolishly have ripped
away their old cast-iron. We will
overcome this. There is a good line
of cast-iron now available at an
excellent price, produced in plastic.
Trams: We have an advantage here,
for it is well known that American
tourists adore trams. However, it
would be better if we could urge the
Melbourne Metropolitan Tramways
Board to convert as quickly as
possible to cable cars.
But there’s another problem. Let’s
face it. Most of all, Americans really
like the sinful, sleazy East, so how
can Melbourne compete? Admittedly,
we are planning on pictures on Sun-
day nights, but we should go further.
Little Lonsdale Street should be
returned to its former mystery and
magic, to compete dollar-for-dollar
with the Won Chai district in Hong
Kong.
We should have lots of little men
in peaked caps out at Essendon:
“You come to Menzies. You come
Southern Cross . . . Australia . . .
Savoy Plaza.” We should have
characters who sidle up and say:
“Psst ... all other stores in town
dishonest, I get you extra special price
at George’s.” Then, naturally, all
stores would introduce bargaining.
The tourist is awfully upset if he
can’t haggle and have the ego-build-
ing triumph of beating the salesman
down several pounds.
As in Manila, we should have lots
of illegal gambling dens, very popular
with the tourists. The police, too,
should carry machine-guns. Where
do you get your Eastern intrigue if
they are all unarmed?
Exhibition Street, I think, we
would make Strip Row, and the
Exhibition Building would be a
natural for the world’s biggest dance
hall, with 6000 taxi dancers. I think
it would be a help if there were news
reports of the occasional beating up
of a tourist in Fitzroy or Colling-
wood. Tourists hate a place which is
completely safe.
If Mr Bolt~ will only stick by me,
he won’t need to launch his income
tax.

Australia not for Sale
How to keep our oil resources
By Dr MALCOLM MACKAY, MUR
If there is one area of national
decision more urgent than another,
with the immediate exception of
defence measures, it is in supplying an
answer to the question: How much of
Australia is up for sale, and at what
price?
Every day unfolds new concepts of
the rich resources of this country, both
on its land-surface and underground, and
even out to sea on the continental shelf.
Every day also increases the pressures
exerted by overseas companies and in-
vestors moving into ownership of these
resources, and often in ways which can
determine the method and extent of their
development and exploitation. The fault
lies at many doors, and not a little is due
to the Federal system which gives each
State sovereignty over its mineral re-
serves and even leads them into compe-
tition in an attempt to attract overseas
bidding. In the case of the enormous
bauxite deposits around Weipa in
northern Queensland, for instance, the
amount of Australian ownership in the
venture has been estimated at less than
one per cent. In the case of Mt Isa,
we have only ourselves to blame that
the Americans risked their money in the
early stages of development when Aus-
tralians were too timid. Now they own
the lion's share.
With even more recent developments,
such as the iron ore deposits in Western
Australia, the manganese in the Northern
Territory (at Groote Eylandt) and the
bauxite at Gove, it is profoundly to be
hoped that a higher Australian equity
will be a condition of ownership. Per-
haps the most immediate and urgent
question of all, however, relates to the
indigenous petroleum production indus-
try. The sheer potential size of this in-
dustry dwarfs all the others. Yet it is
here that overseas ownership becomes a
larger problem day by day.
The only way Australia has held an
equity in oil leases and exploration has
been through purchase of shares in the

chairman of an oil exploration com-
pany, Federal Member (Lib.) for
Evans and formerly Master of Basser
College in the University of New
South Wales.
extremely risky stocks of the various
local oil companies. To attract investors
at all has been a problem, particularly
in the early days, when many of the
pundits said categorically that this
country could not produce any oil —it
being geologically “too old”. The States,
for this reason, gave those who were
prepared to spend money on oil search
the prospecting rights over enormous
tenements with very few obligations as to
work performed. In the case of Santos,
in South Australia, for example, the
larger portion of the State comprises
their lease. In former days it was a
real victory to entice overseas know-how
and capital into the search.
Yet with the varying fortunes of ex-
ploration, even those Australians who
provided the capital to begin the task
have increasingly felt constrained to sell
when the stock market offered a margin
of profit. It would be fair to say that, at
this very moment, if all overseas buying
were removed from the exchanges the
prices of even our most excitingly suc-
cessful companies’ shares would drop.
This is the precarious situation on which
our national ownership of our petroleum
production resources depends. Even
this is made more tenuous still when one
hears stories of the activities of the
taxation authorities in one or other of
the States deciding to have a blitz on
capital profits accruing from this source.
We have no legislation similar to that in
the United Kingdom where stocks held
for more than six months are reckoned
to be genuine investments, and capital
gains over longer than that period are
not treated as trading profits.
With the coming of natural gas as one
of our major sources of power, another
vital issue will be that of local equity
in the ownership of the pipelines. These
are the safest and almost blue-chip i n '
vestments of the oil business. Overseas
capital is queuing up for a chance to
invest here, and it is hoped that enter-
prising Australian individuals, com-
panies and institutions will be well to
the fore when this industry begins.
The vital question of local equity
however, must not be left to the vagaries
of the share market, at least not entirely

and unaided. When one Australian
prospecting company a few years ago
tried to write into its articles a provision
for all-Australian ownership of its shares,
the proposition was rejected by the
stock exchanges, who said that they first
required some direction from the Com-
monwealth. When it was explained
that the Commonwealth did not see its
way clear to enforce such a provision,
the chairman of the two biggest
exchanges said that a mere expression of
desire from the Government would be
sufficient. So far, I am not aware that
any such lead has been given. The first
thing which might be done would be
for the various Governments, Federal
and State, to unite in telling the world
at large that they expected all mining
companies to comprise a certain mini-
mum Australian beneficial ownership of
their capital—say 40 per cent.
The second line of action would flow
from this, if this did not produce satis-
factory results, and that would be to
offer some benefit, contingent upon a
certain stated local equity, or alterna-
tively to adopt a sliding scale of penal-
ties. For example, the present 10 per
cent royalty payable to the State
Governments could be increased by 1 per
cent for every per cent the Australian
content fell below 40 per cent. A form
of statutory declaration, similar to that
on transfers relating to television com-
pany shares, could be the means of
determining these figures. Finally, the
Commonwealth might indicate that the
significance of our mineral resources was
proving so great as to constitute a major
factor in determining our economic
security, and in the case of strategic
minerals such as oil, aluminium, copper,
etc., they could greatly affect our
defence situation. Unless the States were
prepared to co-operate in a policy of
rationalisation of the mineral industry,
then the Commonwealth should use its
taxation, excise, and even its defence
and external affairs powers to establish
matters of essential principle.
Tn case these rather strong words are
thought to be too like the outpourings of
a frustrated back-bencher, let me con-
clude on a note of an important ad-
vance. A few weeks ago I pointed out
to the new Minister for National Deve-
lopment (Mr David Fairbairn) that,
whereas it was possible for overseas
buyers to purchase and export shares in
Australian mining companies, the
Treasury had not seen fit to permit Aus-
tralians to use foreign currency to buy
even their own shares back again when
they could do so on a price advantage
basis. Possibly partly due to the great
advances we have made in terms of our
reserves of overseas currency, but also
to the robust Australianism of the
Minister, that anomaly now no longer
exists.

The Losing Battle for
Road Safety
Lessons from France and the USA
By DAVID McKAY
Reading and listening to the good
intentions propagated by road safety
organisations and our Governments, and
then driving an average 25,000 miles a
year over our roads, makes me wonder
just what these good intentions are
worth. It seems to me that road safety
is a cause so apparently doomed to
failure that no one in authority is really
keen to get behind it.
The basic obstacle is the driver him-
self, and I am certain that the aggressive
and competitive people who make up an
altogether too large percentage of our
motorists don't care a damn about road
safety. To them driving is an escape
from their humdrum lives, and dull,
safe journeys are not what they look for.
Some dangerous incident, a near head-on
collision, makes for an audience at the
bar and instead of his acquaintances
feeling revulsion at the story of dare-
devilry they embroider the story them-
selves and the bad driver becomes a
kind of hero.
I have listened to men of above-
average intelligence relating how they got
home drunk from some gathering and
not remembering how they did it.
Drunken, dangerous and negligent
driving charges often bring surprisingly
lenient penalties; perhaps the magistrate
has a pang of conscience and thinks,
“There but for the grace of God went
I”. But when a magistrate does get
tough he gets a storm of abuse from all
angles. There seems no genuine con-
certed effort by Government, police or
public to combat road slaughter.
The uniform as deterrent
Decently four plain police cars were
put on NSW roads to deter the
killers. Forty or four hundred would
achieve something, but in my opinion
prevention is better than cure, and uni-
formed motorcycle policemen patrolling
the roads are the only real deterrents.
And these patrols should get out on the
highways, and not hang around the 35
mph areas. France proved this last Whit-
sun, when a 50 per cent cut in road
deaths was attributed to a near full turn-
out of police, prominently stationed.
The USA spends vast sums on re-
search into road safety; their findings
are steadfastly ignored by our experts.
Known safety aids such as reflecting
numberplates to give bright warning
of an unattended parked vehicle have
been resisted here for years.
Speed limit raised
A merica has found that when speed
limits were raised to a realistic level
the accident rate declined. The authori-
ties earned the respect of the motorists,
who in turn drove at a more natural, con-
centration-promoting and safer speed.
American roads, where everyone cruises
at 60 mph on well-designed and con-
structed motorways, have the lowest
accident rate in the world.
A competent motorist should cover
our roads and report on the dozens of
places where, for some incredible reason,
double lines are missing. Foliage should
be cut back from warning signs, trees
cleared on dangerous corners.
Much criticism is made of the truck-
ing industry and its part in the road
slaughter. Yet so little is done. When
one operator suggested that under-
powered trucks should be banned from
the highways and that only trucks
capable of pulling their full loads up
hills at 30 mph should be licensed the
authorities didn’t take him seriously. In
the trucking industry the would-be re-
former needs to tread warily lest he run
headlong into vested interests.
If we admit that the human element is
still public enemy No. 1 on our roads
we should at least do everything in our
power to see that the killers are mini-
mised. Not until I see our road patrols
(uniformed police, not plain clothed)
doubled, stiffer penalties dealt out, our
licensing system drastically tightened,
death-traps such as one-way bridges and
badly surfaced corners removed from
our highways, old crocks junked, and
stricter supervision over trucks, will I
consider our fight against death on the
roads anything but half-hearted lip
service.


REVIEWS
FILMS
A Fiasco in Mexico
Eccentrics in a self-made trap
By BEVERLEY TIVEY
Night of the Iguana. Director, John
Huston. St. James, Liberty and
King’s Cross Metro Theatres, Syd-
ney.
What a Way to Go! Director J. Lee-
Thompson. Regent Theatre, Sydney.
Tn “Night of the Iguana” the talents of
Tennessee Williams and John Hus-
ton don't coincide. Their approach is
similar (which is no doubt what attracted
Huston to the play): they both love to
assemble a collection of oddball charac-
ters and watch them tearing the hide off
one another. But then they part com-
pany. Williams is concerned (passionately,
if not always very lucidly) with rare, un-
certain moments of communion, love and
belief. Huston as passionately concerns
himself with human behavior, the way
people act.
Williams is an artist who expresses
himself chiefly through the spoken word,
while Huston’s chief interest is in the
camera. Neither is concerned with a
“message”, but an underlying theme can
be detected running through Williams’
plays. Huston’s films have no such theme.
Ranging from “The Red Badge of Cour-
age” to “The List of Adrian Messenger”
they have no common denominator ex-
cept that they are challenges met.
Huston’s greatest films (“The Maltese
Falcon”, “Treasure of the Sierra Madre”)
are based on novels in which physical
action is paramount, with the charac-
ters’ underlying motives revealed by im-
plication. His most resounding failure
(“Moby Dick”) stemmed from his mis-
understanding of the book's true spirit;
he treated Melville’s novel as if it were
a rousing tale of the sea and of pic-
turesque sailormen, instead of a pro-
found examination of the problem of
good and evil.
He also fails in “Night of the Iguana”,
concentrating on the play’s surface sen-
sationalism but none of its deeper im-
plications (and even on this superficial
level the film is confused and unsatis-
factory). The screenplay (on which Hus-
ton himself worked) is filled with irrele-
vancies; the few remaining sequences
of pure Williams stand out in uneasy
contrast.
The three main characters of the
play, who meet in a ramshackle Mexican
inn, are people caught in a self-made
trap: the failed priest, about to lose his
last job as courier for a travel agency;
the lonely, lusty widow who keeps the
hotel and a couple of Mexican beach-
boys; the spinster who dedicates her life
to shoring up the health and the ego
of an ancient ex-poet.
Only the last characters make any
real impact in the film; for once Huston
has let Williams do the talking, and
Deborah Kerr gives a performance of
extraordinary beauty and sensitivity.
Richard Burton, with his battered
handsomeness, looks convincing as the
disgraced man of the cloth, but there is
little depth in the characterisation; and
Ava Gardner, usually a competent and
occasionally an impressive actress, gives
a performance of astonishingly amateur-
ish gaucherie.
In some of the earlier, written-in
sequences on the tourist bus, there is
some sharp observation of the quirks of
human behavior, but Huston seems lost
in the later scenes between the three
principals. He makes the players indulge
in unnecessary, often absurd by-play
for instance, during a quarrel, Burton
and Gardner play a sort of tennis rally
with a drink-laden trolley.
A lavishly produced comedy is a new
departure for J. Lee-Thompson, and
“What a Way to Go!” is intermittently a
successful one. It’s best to approach it
as a revue, thankful for the funny
moments (of which there are a good
many) and enduring the flatter stretches.
One can be thankful, too, for Shirley
MacLaine.
The revue style is not surprising, since
the screenplay is by Betty Comden and
Adolph Green. It’s essentially a series of
blackout sketches, with the disadvantage
that they are all variations on the same
theme. Shirley MacLaine plays a sort of
Cinderella in reverse a girl whose
dream is true love in a humble cottage,
but who to her dismay finds husband
after husband betraying her by becoming
rich and successful.
As she tells her problems to a psy.
chiatrist, her life with each man is told
in a parody of film styles. It’s a bright
idea, but often developed unimagin-
atively: for instance the credit titles for
the Ross Hunter-style production offer
wonderful opportunities which are largely
ignored. And the Hollywood musical
parody (with Shirley MacLaine as a com-
bination Jane Powell and Cyd Charisse)
which begins very entertainingly, is al-
lowed to stretch out into repetitious bore-
dom.
Edith Head, presented with a de-
signer's dream of a film, has also missed
her opportunities. Her costumes for the
fantasy scenes are generally ugly and
only rarely amusing; and in one of the
“real-life” sequences she afflicts Miss
MacLaine with a red suit and hat that
make her look like a walking fire hyd-
rant.
OPERA
Madeira’s
Carmen
Carmen. Elizabethan Theatre Trust,
Elizabethan Theatre, Sydney.
Elizabethan Trust production of
A Bizet's “Carmen'’ was in many ways
a disappointing one. Musically, the per-
formance was never less than adequate,
and it achieved some distinction in Mary
O'Brien's singing of the part of Micaela.
But the dramatic force of the music was
often dissipated by indifferent produc-
tion. The first two acts seemed to be
conceived in terms of a series of static
and not very effective tableaux, which
at best hampered the movement of the
action and at worst reminded one of
Gilbert and Sullivan. The third act,
which lends itself more readily to tableau
treatment, was a considerable improve-
ment on the first two.
In the last act, the principals, Nicola
Filacuridi and Jean Madeira, seemed to
have been allowed much more initiative,
and as a result the drama came to life
in the final scene. At times this scene
showed signs of developing into a shout-
ing match; but this came as a welcome
relief after the often irrelevant vocal
mannerisms that had weighed down
some of the earlier singing.
The limitations of the production were
not confined to overall conception, but
showed through in a number of
important points of detail as well. For
instance, Don Jose nervously ignores
Carmen in two scenes where he ought to
be fascinated by her despite himself

TV) commemorate Ray Charles’ first
visit to Australia, Festival Records
have released an album which, although
hardly typical of this extraordinarily ver-
satile blind artist, has an appeal all its
own. On “Have a Smile With Me”,
Charles, with the help of his “shouting”
17-piece band and the Raelets, trans-
forms such comic songs as “I Never See
Maggie Alone”, “Ma, He's Making
Eyes At Me”, “The Thing” and “Two-
ton Tessie”.
Like Nat “King” Cole (whose influ-
ence he admits), Ray Charles began his
musical career as a jazz pianist and blues
singer and, until recently, his supporters
came mostly from the jazz ranks. Now
—nicknamed The Genius and with
“soul” as his gimmick—he has invaded
the pop world and that exciting blues-
tinged voice can even be heard singing
Country and Western numbers.
One wonders if Charles’ artistry can
withstand the tremendous exploitation he
is now experiencing. My guess is that,
like Cole and Ella Fitzgerald, he will
develop into a superior popular singer
whose connections with the jazz that
nurtured him will diminish in inverse
ratio to his new obligations.
If a Negro singing Cockney songs is
unusual, a Japanese band playing Glenn
Miller arrangements is positively sur-
realistic. Nowadays, the appeal of the
original versions of “String of Pearls”,
“Tuxedo Junction”, etc., is chiefly
nostalgic; with this quality missing, their
re-creation becomes a technical exercise
and, in this case, a highly successful one
from the points of view of musical pre-
cision and sound reproduction.
Actually “Operation Glenn Miller”
will be of most interest to the high
fidelity enthusiast. With their post-war
skill and thoroughness in matters elec-
tronic, the Japanese have investigated
recording techniques and this album is
the result of considerable experimenta-
tion with “multiple channels” and the
“variable pitch” process, details of which
comprise the sleeve notes. These notes
give no information on the music or
the musicians, but the band would seem
to be an amalgamation of the Poss
Miyazaki All Stars and Nubuo Hara’s
Sharps and Flats. Aided by the excellent
reproduction, they sound surprisingly
well and only a slight stiffness in the
rhythm section and the improvised solos
betray their non-American origin.
Barber’s British success has in-
eluded a couple of coals-to-New-
castle trips to the United States. All
tracks on this Ace of Clubs reissue were
recorded during his group’s early days
(1954-55) and, in spite of many imper-
fections, there is an enthusiasm present
that is missing from many of their later
efforts. At that stage the personnel in-
cluded Monty Sunshine (clarinet) and
Lonnie Donegan (banjo), both of whom
were to strike out on their own at the
height of the boom.
With two exceptions Barber’s own
“Merrydown Rag” and (surprisingly)
“Skokiaan” the tunes are from the
standard Dixieland repertoire and in-
evitably suffer from comparison with the
original versions. The front line, led
by Pat Halcox’s trumpet, is spirited if
tonally emaciated, but the archaic
banjo and tuba provide an unyielding
and monotonous rhythmic background.
Ottilie Patterson, an Irish girl, gives a
fair imitation of Bessie Smith on three
of that illustrious blues singer’s best-
known numbers, but, except on the first
chorus of “Reckless Blues”, the voice is
uneven and the mood not well-sustained.
“It’s Tight Like That”, “The Martinique”
and “Chimes Blues” chiefly because
they are good tunes —are the best instru-
mental numbers.

Landscapes and

Lawrence Daws. Recently at South
Yarra Gallery, Melbourne.
T awrence Daws’ large exhibition of
paintings and gouaches at the South
Yarra Gallery was indeed a pleasure to
see, with its handsome coloring, con-
fident draughtsmanship and fine atmo-
sphere of spaciousness.
He paints now on a larger scale (up
to six feet square) yet with greater
simplicity. Mostly it is landscape with
metaphysical overtones —he still has for
instance some mandala pictures, in
which the symbol of contemplation
(simplified to a circle, sometimes
broken) hangs over bare, dark land-
scapes. The specific significance of the
emblem is not altogether clear, but since
his approach to landscape is meditative
rather than emotive, the paintings can
be better appreciated in the abstract
terms of spatial and color harmonies, in
which the mandala has a general signifi-
cance.
The same view might be taken also
of the symbols which echo Aboriginal
myths. Here, however, there is a
smoother flow of imagery between land-
scape and symbol. Whereas the man-
dalas are neatly and precisely placed in
firmly geometric space so that there is
tension between the circle and the sur-
rounding squares and lines, the fine
sweep of the serpent across the sky and
the various bulbous shapes used in other
pictures are made closer in form and
color to the landscape. They are in any
case symbols which draw their meaning
intimately from the land.
As well as these beautifully poised
landscapes of the supernatural, there are
several more direct landscapes, still
abstracted to a considerable degree, but
more expressive both of lyrical and of
sombre feeling. The gouache landscapes,
generally lighter in tone, include some
very delicately lyrical work.
In a few paintings and gouaches Daws
has turned also to figures (this and the
greater spaciousness of his landscape
suggest recent English influences). Figure
on the Beach V is perhaps the best of
these, very confidently and freely painted
with its robust figure, finely abstracted
landscape background and splendid
color. One of Daws’ most notable
qualities is his control of quite flam-
boyant color. In this show his skill never
fails him, and on his broad open spaces
he very often creates images of dignity
and beauty.
The prices for such finished and
poised work were thoroughly reasonable.

The Legend of
Don Whitington
A new Australian myth
By PETER COLEMAN
The Rulers. Don Whitington. Lans-
downe Press. 325. 6d.
Qince I think Don Whitington’s new
book is fundamentally wrong on
almost all major aspects of Australian
politics over the past 15 years, it should
be emphasised that the book is impor-
tant and worth reading: nowhere else
will one find such a clear and well
marshalled summary of what is now an
established and, for some people, com-
forting legend about this period. It
seems ironical that Whitington, a tough-
minded and cynical observer of politics,
has perhaps without intending it
become a sophisticated apologist for the
intellectual laziness of the Labor Party
and, even to some extent, of some
sections of the Liberal Party.
The elements of the legend—which in
Whitington’s case are sometimes only
implied—are these:
1. Labor is the natural government
of Australia.
2. The Liberals have been in power
so long largely due to (a) luck;
(b) prosperity; (c) DLP viciousness.
3. The Liberals have misused their
years and their dictator has
delayed reforms.
4. Normalcy will return when Labor
snaps out of its conservatism and
gets a forward-looking policy.
These elements constitute a strong
enough legend, but is there any truth
in it? Take each element in turn:
Labor as the Natural Government.
Since Labor has been out of office
throughout 75 per cent of Federal his-
tory, this idea cannot on the face of it
be taken seriously, though it may make
more sense taken along with the ex-
planations of Liberal success. So perhaps
we should begin there:
Liberal Luck, (i.e., the Labor Party
split). The Labor split has obviously
been one of the great facts of the period
and the explanation of it one of the key
tests of any commentator. But it is
surely superficial to use it as almost an
explain-all of Liberal success. The split
was no mere unfortunate Labor accident.
It was rather the culmination, perhaps
the beginning of the end, of Labor his-
tory. The point is that the Party split
over Communism and nationalisation
because these were obnoxious to the
electorate, or, in different words, be-
cause liberalism, which was not confined
to the Liberal Party but found its main
expression there, was aggressive and
popular. It would be truer to say that
the split was one by-product of revived
liberalism, that in this sense the Liberals
caused the split rather than that they
passively and lazily accepted the electoral
results of it. In any case the whole free
world, from America to Europe, turned
liberal or conservative after World
War 11. History, as well as Australian
nationalism, was on the Liberal Party’s
side, and in this context the Labor split
was a side issue. The split has been
useful to the Liberals, especially in
certain seats, but to reduce everything to
this is to misunderstand the whole nature
of the post-war Liberal surge and the in-
roads it made on the Labor movement.
Prosperity. The idea is that voters
have been corrupted by TV and
HP, and vote Liberal out of political
apathy. This must be the laziest myth
of all though curiously it seems almost as
popular in Liberal as in Labor circles.
But it is surely a misconception that
people vote on only “bread-and-butter
issues”; it seems safer to say they usually
vote on ideological grounds—though in
fact they probably vote for an image, of
which ideology is one of the most im-
portant constituents. (There is another
myth that Australia is a country without
ideology; in fact it, like all countries, is
heavily ideological, the point being that
Australians are largely in ideological
agreement.) Australians keep Liberals in
power not only because they enjoy pros-
perity but also because they are
ideologically committed to this way of
getting it. There is, after all, no in-
evitable tie-up between liberalism and
prosperity. Tabor could possibly keep
us prosperous enough. Even Communist
regimes, like Czechoslovakia and East
Germany, are prosperous, but who wants
it at that price? Prosperity helps the
Liberals, but most of their real strength
is their ideology even if they do not
always realise it themselves.
DLP viciousness. According to Whit-
ington the DLP is the product of Roman
Catholic hunger for power and State
Aid. This distortion needs no fresh
laboring; anyone who in this way under-
estimates the DLP voters’ concern with
totalitarianism, with the alternative
government’s policies over Malaysia,
Exmouth Gulf, SEATO and the Ameri-
can alliance, has not seriously examined
this Party.
Wasted Years. This is the most disap-
pointing theme in the book. A good case
can be made out that Liberals are still
stuck with the idees fixes of 1949 apd
that in defence, foreign policy, economic
planning and federalism they need to
rethink their ideology. Unfortunately
there is little of this in Whitington’s
book. He barely mentions defence, for
example, and although he is on stronger
ground when talking about constitutional
reform, his case is confused since he has
to attack the Liberal Government both
for dictatorship and for refusing to give
itself more power. In any case, it is
one thing to emphasise the urgent need
for rethinking, but it is mere propaganda
to imply the years were wasted which
have seen unprecedented prosperity and
immigration, the laying of the basis of
a realistic foreign policy, and reforms
in trade and commerce, in industrial,
health and divorce law, and in censor-
ship administration, with restrictive
practices legislation yet to come. In a
real sense, Whitington is not nearly
critical enough of the Liberals; in an-
other, he is far too critical —merely for
the sake of the legend.
Dictatorship (i.e., Menzies). Prime
Ministers are always fair game, but
otherwise, in an age of expanding gov-
ernment and of men like Kennedy or
Johnson, Macmillan or de Gaulle, our
puny dictatorship, cribbed and confined
by a 19th-century constitution, would
hardly be worth special discussion
except to concede the Liberal Party
propaganda point that it is a curious
dictator who has almost annually, in one
election or another (general, Senate,
double dissolution, etc.), put himself to
the country. Whitington’s evidence boils
down to the Browne-Fitzpatrick privilege
case a bad prosecution, indeed, but
unfortunately one which all parties
enthusiastically endorsed and to the
foolish question whether the Security


service (which the Labor Party to its
credit launched) is “even necessary”.
There are surely better criticisms to be
made of the Government than this.
Return to normalcy. Here Whitington
is far too unkind to the Labor Party.
His idea is that the Labor Party is shack-
led with old-fashioned ideas but when it
wakes up it will sweep away the Liberal
do-nothings. Certainly one wing of the
Labor Party is anachronistic, yet the
Party as a whole has plenty of “new”
ideas. The trouble is they are and the
electorate considers them to be bad
and dangerous ones, i.e., ritualistic
Left-wing ideas. It does not only need
more new ideas; it needs different ones.
As far as normalcy is concerned, it
seems we returned there some years ago,
in 1949. History still seems on the
Liberals’ side, and, in historical per-
spective, the DLP which began as a
Labor Party (and could have been saved
—as it still may be —by a reformed
ALP) may be seen as the forerunner of
a general tide of Labor voters moving to
the Liberals. Labor became a power
federally as an ally of the Liberals and
this may be how it will end up with
the dinosaur and Left-wings of the Labor
Party surviving in an alliance with that
other anachronism, the Country Party.
Whitington’s book may be the last
time his Labor legend is stated so force-
fully. Labor supporters should read it,
then put it aside. What Labor needs is
not legends but reforms. Meanwhile the
Liberals must still wait for a book of
genuinely searching criticism.
Restlessness
A Message in Code: The Diary of
Richard Rumboid, 1932-61. Edited
by William Plomer. Weidenfeld
and Nicolson. 455.
J. H. Thomas: A Life for Unity. Gre-
gory Blaxland. Muller. 455.
“ A Message in Code” is a fragmentary
and immature record of a sadly
confused life. On his own evidence
Richard Rumboid was an egocentric and
neurotic dilettante whose literary ambi-
tions were constantly frustrated by a
fragility of temperament which pre-
cluded the hard work necessary for suc-
cess. His first book, written at the age
of twenty, was an abortive novel which
caused a tea-cup scandal because of its
criticism of the Roman Catholic Church.
Two later books were better received:
“My Father’s Son”, a bitter autobio-
graphy of his early years; and “The
Winged Life”, a life of Saint-Exupery.
Rumboid was nineteen when he began
his diary and, even at that age, there
were signs of the spiritual and physical
restlessness which was to drive him on a
fruitless search for faith and fulfilment.
Though financially independent and a
man of “magnificent physical presence”,
most of the time he appears to have
been in a state of near-suicidal despair.
On discovering he had tuberculosis at
twenty, he wrote: “Really, living is such
an awkward business, I haven’t much
desire to continue with it.”
Much of his mental conflict and, pro-
bably, his homosexuality can be blamed
on his brutal, insensitive father and his
ineffectual mother. His only prolonged
period of happiness was during a year
with the RAF: in flying he found a
mystical release from his troubled exis-
tence. Later in life he found short-lived
peace by adopting the Buddhist religion,
and his visits to Ceylon and Japan
(where he entered a Zen monastery) are
fully described in long, narrative entries
which, presumably, he hoped to use in
a book.
Due to his overwhelming self-interest,
he rarely says anything revealing about
his distinguished acquaintances, and his
attempts to be profound have a naivete
which is not confined to the earlier
entries. Right up to the time of his
death by suicide or accident, he con-
tinued to seek a metaphysical peg on
which to hang the burden of his identity.
As his editor says, “Neither in
Christianity nor in Buddhism, nor in
travel, nor in flying, nor in writing, nor
in sex . . . was he ever to find a way out
of himself, or a resting-place in either
faith or hope.”
After the hot-house atmosphere of
Rumbold’s diary, “J. H. Thomas: a Life
for Unity” is like a breath of fresh air,
slightly adulterated by Welsh coal-dust.
Gregory Blaxland complains that Jimmy
Thomas was the “last person to keep a
diary” but, without the help such a diary
would have been, he has produced a
lively record of Thomas’ life. For those
interested in trade unionism and British
politics during the first half of this
century, this is essential reading, but
even the general reader will enjoy the
story of this many-sided politician and
the fascinating background of the period.
In England, during 1911, “the smell
of revolt tickled the nostrils of aristocrat
and navvy alike”: women were agitating
for the franchise; the workers were
coming out on strike; the House of
Lords was thinking in terms of defence
barricades; there were blood-letting riots
in London and Liverpool. It was in
this atmosphere of political unrest that
Jimmy Thomas, recently elected to Par-
liament and already a veteran trade
union official, was able to accomplish—
with his tact, thick skin, and powers of
persuasion—so much for the working
class in general and the railwaymen in
particular. From an illegitimate birth in
poor circumstances, he became a
Cabinet Minister and a favorite of
King George V.
He led the effective strikes of 1911
and 1919, but he gained more by shrewd
negotiation, his weapons being sincerity
and a natural eloquence. Dropped
aitches were perhaps a deliberate part
of his rugged delivery, and when once
he complained of “an ’orrible ’eadache”,
Birkenhead suggested he try a “couple
of aspirates”.
On his entrance to the House of Com-
mons, Thomas was impressed by the
treatment extended to him and, like his
crony Ramsay MacDonald, he suc-
cumbed to what Sidney Webb referred
to as the “aristocratic embrace”. His
taste for high living was interpreted by
many of his old associates as a betrayal
of his class. He was deeply hurt when
the railwaymen refused his plea for a
pension.
His sense of humor was always in
evidence and he needed all he could
muster when, as one of the Big Five in
MacDonald's 1936 National Govern-
ment, the Budget Leak Tribunal’s findings
shattered his career. “The Rt Hon.
Dress Suit, MP”, as David Low dubbed
him, died in 1949 at the age of 74. Mr
Blaxland's well-illustrated biography is
a sympathetic memorial.

Emergent
Nations
Ballot Box and Bayonet: People and
Government in Emergent Asian
Countries. Hugh Tinker. Oxford
University Press. 14s. 3d.
Tj\)R the rational liberal democrat in the
- 11 Western tradition, the current his-
tory of emergent Asian nations makes
unpleasant reading. In all too many
of them the “revolution of indepen-
dence” has been followed by a counter-
revolution suspending or liquidating the
formally democratic institutions estab-
lished only a few years earlier. Nation-
alism has quickly replaced democracy
as the OK-word in Asia; the semblance
of national unity seems more important
to Asians than genuine elections or the
right to protest or dissent.
Nevertheless, as Dr Hugh Tinker of
the University of London shows in this,
the fifth of the Chatham House Essays
on International Issues, the emergent
Asian governments cannot be written
off as simple dictatorships either.
“Whether in democratic lands, such as
India, Malaya, or the Philippines, or
in lands where despotism reigns (as in
Pakistan, Thailand dr the Sudan), and
whether benevolent or malevolent, the
rulers are seeking means whereby the
audience can be associated with the
national drama.
“There is a national plan, a national

programme; there is a Revolution of
Rising Expectations; and there are the
mass of the ordinary people, awakening
to their potential power as the makers
and breakers of their political master.
“The formula that has been devised to
knit together the national and the local
political impulse has a remarkable simi-
larity in many of the emergent countries.
The formula is, broadly, the mobilisa-
tion of the local sense of community
and of economic and social aspiration in
a local development effort which reaches
up to the provincial or national effort."
The strong sense of community and
the rejection of the Western conception
of politics as based on rational argu-
ment are common to most—funda-
mentally, indeed, to all —of the emergent
Asian nations. But Dr Tinker is con-
cerned to stress that these nations can-
not be treated as all following one line
of development. Thus, in India, the
liberal movement under British occupa-
tion was at first of a high intellectual
level, non-popular in character and
dialectical in style. Much of the point
of Gandhi's moral politics was to in-
augurate an appeal that would go beyond
the Westernised elite to the people; but
nevertheless, “in South Asia the inde-
pendence movement remained, even at
moments when hysteria was uppermost,
a political argument.”
In Burma and Indonesia, on the other
hand, the Second World War familiarised
nationalist groups with the tactics and
power of resistance movements and
thus gave nationalism in those countries
a characteristically militarist slant. Such
militarism was intensified where the
country, like Indonesia, had to fight for
its independence and/or against dissident
groups, but such struggles also helped to
promote the national unity on which the
leaders depend.
The enormous merit of Dr Tinker’s
book, however, does not rest on these
general, fairly obvious points. He has
compressed into 40,000 thoroughly read-
able words a great deal of very detailed
information about all the new Asian
nations that have emerged from colonial-
ism, from India to the Philippines, from
Vietnam to Indonesia. He is best,
perhaps, on India and Burma, and weak-
est on Malaysia and Indo-China, but
throughout he displays a considerable
gift for detailed illustrations and cross-
national comparisons.
On a more general level. Dr Tinker's
main contribution lies in showing that
Western political concepts cannot be
simply transferred to Asian political
situations. The concept of a “power
elite” especially, he argues, is not an
adequate tool for understanding Asian
government. We should rather turn to
the history of Asian states, including the
circumstances in which they won their
independence, in order to understand
the political forms and the political cli-
mate that are emerging.
Understanding is not the same as
liking. To say that Western concepts
will not help us to understand what
Asian governments are doing is not to
concede that it is inappropriate to judge
them according to Western values.
Judged on these values, that is, on
rational, democratic terms, all the Asian
nations with the exception of India have
so far failed. But Dr Tinker prefers
to explain rather than to judge.
ALICE ERH-SOON TAY
Tragic Hellenist
John Addington Symonds. Phyllis
Grosskurth. Longmans. 565. 6d.
Tohn Symonds is now chiefly remem-
** bered as the author of the monu-
mental “Renaissance in Italy". As his-
torian, essayist and poet he has suffered
an almost total eclipse. Nevertheless,
Miss Grosskurth’s sympathetic biography
is of great interest to the general reader
because, having had access to Symonds'
still unpublished autobiography, she is
able to reveal a side of the man which,
though it has not been unknown, has
so far received little attention.
Symonds was a homosexual of the
more tragic kind, and without the insight
into his conflicts which this book pro-
vides it is impossible to understand his
work. He has come down to us as the
typical Victorian aesthete, a lush, self-
conscious stylist. But his romantic pre-
occupation with Hellenism was the ex-
pression of a personal dilemma and it
bore fruits for which posterity owes him
a debt. Always seeking an historical justi-
fication for his own drives, he discovered
the authentic correspondence between
Michelangelo and Tommaso Cavalieri
and, later in his life, collaborated with
Havelock Ellis to an extent not hitherto
acknowledged. Vacillating between fear
and courage, he suppressed the erotic
poetry which he wrote while seeking
means of changing the attitude of his
contemporaries to the inversion that held
him in its grip.
He lost his mother in infancy but re-
mained strongly under the influence of
his father, a gifted and attractive man.
Becoming aware early of his sexual ab-
normality, he resisted it stubbornly until
well into middle-life. As a boy at Rugby
he was flung into an environment that
can only be described as a forcing-house
of pathological experience, with every
second boy having his “bitch" and
Vaughan, the celebrated headmaster,
himself a practising paederast. The reve-
lations about Vaughan are among the
most startling in the book. Symonds,
through a series of characteristic epi-
sodes was responsible for getting
Vaughan removed —only to find when he
got to Oxford and eventually became a
Fellow of Magdalen that his own career
was vulnerable to the same kind of
attack.
The Victorians were masters at hush-
ing up scandal and Symonds never lacked
friends to guard his interest. Rich but
dogged by sickness (he suffered from
tuberculosis and spent many years in
Davos) he devoted his hectic energy to
two related causes: the search for an
ideal rationale of his trouble and the
popularisation of what he conceived to
be the true spirit of the Renaissance. In
both endeavors victory eluded him, but
he finally faced up to the reality of his
own inclinations, if not to the fact that
they could not be transmuted into beauty
in the manner of the Symposium. By then
he was a husband, and father of four
daughters, devoured by frustrations and
a haunting sense of human and artistic
inadequacy. Yet he was the classic ex-
ample of the man who, stumbling from
crisis to crisis, learns to create out of
tensions that would destroy lesser talents.
Phyllis Grosskurth is a Canadian scho-
lar. Her study is a model of lucidity, her
research is ample and her style fresh. A
regrettable omission is the absence of
quotations from Symonds' privately pub-
lished poetry which evidently she has
read. This is to some extent compensated
by copious reference to her subject's
correspondence, a good deal of which,
along with other vital data, was withheld
by Horatio F. Brown, Symonds’ disciple
and first biographer. Much of the in-
formation, for instance that bearing on
his painful exchanges with Whitman and
Swinburne, remains fascinating over the
distance of years.
This is a book Symonds would not
have liked because it does not re-establish
him as an important writer. But the
author’s literary judgment is. if any-
thing, more certain than her psychologi-
cal acumen. Two conclusions are per-
mitted. Homosexuality seems to have
been enormously widespread among cul-
tured Victorians (Symonds’ contacts are
some evidence of this) and the socio-
legal position of its victims has changed
remarkably little since his dav.

Today and Yesterday
A TIME OF ENTERPRISE
fpHE coming of USS Enterprise last
week was not the first visit by
United States ships to cause excite-
ment in Sydney. For well over a
century at shortening intervals the
American Navy has been coming
here.
The visit which caused more ex-
citement than any other was the first,
which took place in November-
December, 1839. Its circumstances
were sensational.
Only a week or two before, some-
body had raised in the Executive
Council the question of the defence of
Port Jackson, pointing to the obsoles-
cence of Fort Macquarie on the end
of Bennelong Point and the ineffective
futility of the battery on Dawes Point.
The alarmist was almost howled
down. Things were so quiet in the
great world that, except in the Orient,
war itself seemed to be almost
obsolescent.
And then Commodore Charles
Wilkes, USN, turned up suddenly
with a large naval complement, all
with the kind of expressions on their
countenances that one sees on those
of guests at surprise parties on TV.
The Commodore seems to have been
a humorous fellow, though he was
engaged in the grave task of taking an
exploring expedition on a four-year
tramp round the globe. He had
quite a little fleet with him
the Vincennes, 780 tons (flagship),
and Peacock, 650 tons, men-o’-war
sloops; the Porpoise, 239 tons, the
Seagull and Flying Fish, two pilot
boats; and the Relief, storeship, which
had in November, 1839, arrived in
Sydney Harbor where she was stock-
ing up under the eye of Mr Williams,
the American Consul. Nobody knew
anything in Sydney of the imminent
visit of Wilkes’ squadron when, on
November 29, 1839, after dusk,
Wilkes in Vincennes sighted Green-
way's lighthouse on South Head and
came up to the Heads on a fair north-
easter.
There was no sign of life about the
Heads; no pilot boat. Save for the
lighthouse and its accessory building
there was nothing to show that any-
body was alive in Australia; and
though it was “dark and had no pilot,
yet in order to avoid loss of time”,
the Commodore decided to run
straight in, to the mouth of Sydney
Cove, since he was assured that his
charts were dependable. So he stood
into the mouth of the port “under
press of sail”.
There was a momentary check
when he discovered a light on the
Sow and Pigs which was not on his
chart; but it was only momentary.
Up harbor he sailed smoothly and
surely, Peacock in his wake obeying
his signals on courses. Scarce a light
showed anywhere. And about 10
p.m. he dropped anchor as silently as
he had sailed up harbor, right in the
midst of the shipping and at the very
mouth of Sydney Cove, “without any-
body having any idea of our arrival.”
“When the good people of Sydney
looked abroad in the morning they
were much astonished to see two men-
o’-war lying amid the shipping which
had entered despite the difficulties of
the channel” and the absence of pilot-
age and the darkness of the night.
It went without saying that Sydney
took some time to get over its
shocked realisation that “had war
existed, we might, after firing the
shipping and reducing a great part of
the town to ashes, have effected a
retreat before daylight in perfect
safety”. This, even though the Com-
modore called on the Governor, that
old Royal Engineer, Sir George
C-ipps who knew his America pretty
well, and stated his reasons for the
unceremonious manner in which he
had arrived and why he “had not
tendered the customary salutes”.
Sir George proved “truly kind” and
lent the Commodore Fort Macquarie
for an observatory during his stay
which lasted over Christmas Day.
Sydney was kind, too. The streets
were soon full of American officers
and men glad after a year in South
America and the Islands to be among
people who spoke English. The shops
were cluttered with them. The Aus-
tralian Club, formed the year before,
opened its doors to the officers and
there were balls, parties, excursions
and fetes. The matelots seem to have
found the town one large old-time
King's Cross. They waved farewell
regretfully on Boxing Day to a port
in which there were 250 taverns and
in which “the open practice of vice
and drunkenness stalked abroad” to
such an extent that even “the fairer
sex” were to be seen at broad noon
being carted off to chokey by the
local gendarmes.
Sir George Gipps, saying nothing
in his curt relation of events to the
Home Government about the terrible
surprise he had received, turned his
mind to Sydney's almost non-existent
defences.

BUSINESS AND FINANCE
Mopping Up the Ready-Mix
One of Australia’s longest drawn-out, drag-out takeover
battles entered its final stages when CSR-BMI announ-
ced, after receiving acceptances representing more than
77 p.c. of the issued capital of Ready Mixed Concrete, that
their offer was unconditional. This undoubtedly brought many
wavering RMC shareholders into the CSR-BMI camp. But there
is no assurance that CSR-BMI will get the 90 p.c. acceptance
which they asked for in the first place and which would give
them the right to acquire statutorily the balance of the RMC
capital outstanding.
So much interest has been aroused by this takeover, in-
cluding the national question of monopolies now that CSR-
BMI will control a major share of the ready-mixed concrete
and blue metal quarrying business, that the following inevitable
question arises: What will CSR-BMI do if they do not gain
a 90 p.c. acceptance?
If the Palmer-Richards forces (five of whom have now re-
signed from the RMC board) refuse to surrender their scrip
and can withhold 10 p.c. of the capital, CSR-BMI can be
placed in an embarrassing position. It is all very well to say
that there is no real problem and all that is necessary is for
CSR-BMI to avoid paying dividends on RMC caoital. CSR
already has indicated it is not keen on the ‘‘monopoly - ’ tag
and is a bit sensitive about its public image.
Another argument is that CSR-BMI should buy up any
shares remaining and so strive to complete the takeover, even
at higher prices. But after the takeover date is reached (already
extended again to September 16 or such longer date as may
be decided) the right of statutory acquisition lapses if 90 p.c.
acceptances are not held. This means that even if shares are
acquired after that date which give a 90 p.c. acceptance, the
takeover companies cannot go ahead wfith compulsory acquisi-
tion of the remaining shares outstanding. They most make a
further takeover offer and must gain 90 p.c. of the remaining
shares before exercising compulsory acquisition. In preference
to this, perhaps, the offeror companies may prefer to keep
the initial offer open as long as possible.
In terms of scarcity value, therefore, the share scrip cur-
rently beyond the reach of CSR-BMI could prove expensive
to acquire if the takeover group wants to remove the thorn
from its side.
There’s AMP in Them
Thar Hills
the Australian Mutual Provident Society announced
last w'eek it would invest £1 million in a 51 p.c. share-
holding in Stanbroke Pastoral Co. Pty Ltd (formed to buy two
cattle properties near Cloncurry and Clermont in Queensland),
•t was hailed as a national decision and a new departure for
life office investment. Certainly, it is a good investment lead
for other large institutions, and it also is an important national
trend, if followed up. It is hardly fair, though, to give the
'repression that Australia's inland was completely neglected
and starved for funds until the AMP came along.
The AMP and CSIRO already have done more valuable
work in solving problems of trace elements in South Australia
and developing poor soil for cultivation. Anyone can buy a
cattle station, if he has the necessary cash, but this in itself
is not a guarantee of national development.
Plenty of companies and individuals have sunk money into
properties and failed to make a success of it. There have been
instances where professional men, such as doctors, have
grouped together and spent large sums in buying properties,
only to lose vast amounts of cash.
True, many of the efforts were tailored with tax saving as the
main object. This did not stop the expenditure of large sums
in developing and maintaining such properties, often with
disastrous capital losses in bad years on properties which had
been worked dry before sale to the newcomers.
Overseas companies have been spending huge sums on
Australian agricultural development for many years. The pro-
fit incentive was there, but success was not guaranteed. The
local L. J. Hooker Corporation is a case in point where heavy
capital outlays are required on its Northern Territory pro-
perties before adequate returns can be expected.
Other pastoral groups, both public and private, have insti-
tutional backing from fife offices and banks (including the
AMP), while the individual certainly does not lack for sup-
port when it comes to investment in agricultural properties.
What is important, however, is that the AMP may provide
a more definite trend in direct investment which, in turn, can
assist directly and indirectly in the expansion of country towns
which do not attract anywhere near the proportionate flow
of investment funds as do the congested city areas.
The AMP is going into the Stanbroke project with experi-
enced partners, viz., Thomas Borthwick & Sons (Australia)
Ltd, which is an old-established UK meat company in Australia
and New Zealand, Squatting Investment Co. Ltd and S. Kid-
man & Co. These vastly experienced shareholders, who are
putting up the other half of the initial capital, would hardly
take kindly to the suggestion that a new era is opening up
because of the AMP participation. Borthwick & Sons owns the
two properties being sold to the group and will retain a
management interest as well. Rather might it be said that
Mr J. S. Balderstone, general manager of Borthwick & Sons,
has been successful in attracting institutional investment to
the Borthwick properties, because Mr Balderstone also is a
member of the Victorian board of the AMP, a director of
Squatting Investment Co. Ltd and a member of the Australian
Meat Board.
Should Tariff Concessions Be
Tied to Research?
npHE current Tariff Board inquiry into the protection afforded
to industrial chemicals and synthetic resins draws attention
to one of Australia's fastest growing industries.
In the decade to 1960, no doubt, it was probably the fast:sl
growing of all industries, with many big names from overseas.


like Monsanto and Union Carbide, expanding their local
manufacturing operations in opposition to giants like ICIANZ.
Many new company flotations found themselves expanding
dizzily and snapped up in takeovers. The rate of expansion
started to slow when overseas producers without local branches
or factories (such as the Japanese) began to discover what a
good market it was.
Evidence from 41 chemical manufacturers in Australia
shows that there is a total investment of about £l2sm. in the
industry, and this must be a conservative figure. Such an
industry inevitably must be complex, because of the conflicting
interests of the overseas giants, who want to control their
various markets without affecting the operations of other
branches, or the imports of the parent company, etc.
The more competition, of course, the better for those indus-
tries dependent on the chemicals suppliers. But the president
of the Chemical Industry Council, Mr T. G. Crane of Mon-
santo, seems to have a valid point when he says that the Tariff
Board should make some special industry allowances for invest-
ment risk, electricity charges (double the cost of overseas com-
petitors) and dumping.
After all, the local user of chemicals gains the benefit of
the millions spent overseas on chemical research (which
basically should enable the parent company to export more
cheaply), while the local manufacturer, fighting for a limited
but competitive market, cannot afford to allocate large sums
for research and must rely on manufacturing rights held
through overseas tie-ups. Ideally, of course, concessions to local
manufacturers would serve a good purpose if tied to an
equivalent expenditure on local research, while tariff protection
to importers could also be tied to research stipulations.
Australia’s Place in Foreign
Aid Programmes
"Oecause Australia resembles poorer nations in being a
developing and capital-importing country, it would exhi-
bit “sheer humbug” if it made that an excuse for not helping
under-developed territories “through aid and trade in the same
measure as other rich countries". This provocatively
expressed thought gave a good deal of point to Professor
H. W. Arndt's Joseph Fisher lecture, “Australian Foreign Aid
Policy”, delivered in Adelaide last week.
Professor Arndt expressed
himself shocked “to hear that
the resolution adopted at the
United Nations Conference on
Trade and Development, asking
each economically advanced
country to give not less than one
p.c. of its national income in aid
to developing countries, was
qualified apparently at the in-
sistence of and for the special
benefit of Australia —by the
phrase ‘having regard, however,
to the special position of certain
countries which are net im-
porters of capital’.”
After those forthright stric-
tures, it may have sounded a
little surprising to hear the pro-
fessor maintain there was not
much seriously wrong with the
forms or directions of Australian
aid. Yet the actual performance
“so far does not justify excessive
self-congratulation”.
Over-riding all possible Aust-
ralian commitments is the pledge
International Chemical Price Indices
The long-heralded Tariff Board inquiry into the Australian
chemical industry began last week and is referred to in an
article beginning on the previous page. The graph above,
based on a chemical price index compiled by ICIANZ, shows
that Australia and Japan have made the largest price reduc-
tions during the last ten years.
to prepare New Guinea for economic and political indepen-
dence. Arndt believes a thorough effort will demand Govern-
ment expenditure “to the limit of the Territory’s absorptive
capacity and attracting private capital by any means which
will not store up trouble for the future”.
Those business sources here which have opposed tied loans
might be interested to learn that Professor Arndt at least con-
siders them better than no loans. He calls for far more aid
participation on the part of private enterprise, especially in
technical assistance.
Trade policy must also be thrown into the ring in working
out satisfactory aid to vital Pacific neighbors. “Australia has
every right to fight side by side with the developing countries
for a better deal for primary products in the markets of the
industrial countries. But she also shares the duty of the
rich industrial countries to stop discriminating against the
exports of manufactures of the so-called ‘low-wage’
countries.”
Following that frequently-mouthed aim, given more honor
than observance, Professor Arndt concludes in a mood of
utmost realism. There's no need to feel sensitive about
linking aid with direct trading interests. “Aid in kind, soft
loans, technical assistance —all these can be of genuine help
to the developing countries and at the same time assist Aus-
tralian manufacturers in overcoming the difficulties of break-
ing into new export markets in competition with the major
overseas industrial countries.”
Relative Optimism Among
World Airlines
■HThe International Air Transport Association's annual report
on world airlines arrives right in the middle of loud dom-
estic upheaval among the Australian airways. The attempted
re-allocation of certain NSW routes and the proposed entry
of a new air-freight carrier (referred to in an article beginning
on page 64) seem likely to keep official and company argu-
mentative pots boiling for some time yet.
If lATA can be believed, though, the world scene appears
relatively calm and even mildly prosperous. Chairman Sir
William Hildred is able to start his review by remarking
that “last year—l 963 —turned out to be quite a good one
for the world's scheduled air
transport industry".
Of course, the actual profits
are nothing to crow about.
Sir William gives vent to “som-
bre satisfaction" at a prelimin-
ary operating profit of 2.4 p.c. in
1963, against 1.5 p.c. in 1962
and a 2 p.c. operating loss for
1961. His objective is “an ade-
quate net profit without the need
for subsidy payments".
On supersonic transport, Sir
William sounds judicious: “It
now appears unlikely that de-
liveries of the first SSTs will be-
gin before 1971 or 1972. But...
the development of good, sound,
commercial aircraft is more im-
portant than early production.
The SST is a complex and ex-
pensive beast and a good deal
more work remains to be done
in a variety of fields. It is still
some years ahead of us a
great deal can happen between
now and then.”

Economic Policy and Full Employment
An unsatisfactory meal from Professor Rowan
IN advance of the G. L. Wood
Memorial Lecture he delivered at
Melbourne University on “Economic
Policy and Full Employment” last week,
Professor D. C. Rowan, from South-
ampton University and one-time aca-
demic out here, was advertised as a dyna-
mic lecturer. One doesn't know about
that. He is certainly a most frustrated
one. It turned out he is a prisoner from
the exclusive cell of monetary policy,
where he admits to serving a long-term
sentence since economic teaching first
arrested him.
Apparently the search for economic
truth and answers in this confined space
has led him round in unrewarding
circles. He is fed up with its bread and
water fare leading nowhere and is seek-
ing, pretty vainly as yet it seemed, for
some more satisfying pasture. Last
Monday, after a glimpse at his prison
findings, with impish delight he led us
round alternative fields for a series of
snacks, without settling down quite long
enough anywhere for a satisfying meal.
In the end he was asking questioners
in the audience to pay the bills.
Rowan's main complaint about mone-
tary policy is that it works too slowly.
He thinks the interest rate changes you
make to halt a rise in inflationary pres-
sure only really start working when the
boom is over, by when it is time to re-
verse them to stop the economy running
too fast downhill. It is the same with
quantitative credit restriction. The
word goes out from the central bank
to the trading banks to curb advances.
Advances go on rising all the same, as
happened here in 1960 when Rowan
believes monetary policy was ineffective
in stopping the boom, fiscal measures
were only adopted after the boom was
well on the wane, and this led on to a
recession which he reckons cost us'
£350 million in GNP.
|Jow slowly does it work? In his view,
there is at least an interval of four
months before applications of monetary
policy bite and he considers they can
take anything up to two years to have
much effect. These were very sweeping
statements, which may or may not be
true for Britain. They may be appli-
cable to experience here, say in 1959-60,
though in the latter case the strength
°f monetary measures taken in those
Years has to be considered. In my view,
Monetary policy was ineffective in 1959-
60 simply because it was too weak and
applied too late.
The best chance of success in using
monetary policy is before prices start
rising, when evidence of an approaching
emergence of inflationary pressure first
appears. Rowan says he detected this,
as indeed some others but apparently not
the Reserve Bank did, early in 1959
when he was here. That was the time to
start putting the pressure on monetary
policy. But interest rates were completely
neglected and action confined to at-
tempts at quantitative credit restriction,
largely through exhortations to the
trading banks. In a system such as
ours, which allows a build-up of un-
drawn overdraft limits, this sort of
action by itself, without using interest
rate changes, has proved to be pretty
ineffective and is open to all the abuse
Rowan or anybody else likes to throw at
it.
TTowever. over the last year or so Dr
* Coombs has become a convert to
the usefulness of interest rates and has,
in fact, used their variation to very good
effect. The first dose, when they were
lowered in April last year, certainly had
the desired effect of stimulating private
investment. So much so, in fact, that,
admittedly assisted by downward pres-
sure on commercial rates exerted by the
massive build-up in liquidity, a year later
there were obvious signs that interest
rates should be increased to put a damp-
ener on private investment. It is early
yet to say whether this move, coupled
with words of caution to the trading
banks on advances, has been as effective
as the one a year earlier in the opposite
direction.
Any blanket condemnation of mone-
tary policy as an instrument of economic
adjustment would seem inappropriate,
though perhaps Rowan did not mean
his disillusionment about its effective-
ness to be taken too literally. One thing
is certain, however. The sooner mone-
tary policy is stiffened on the upswing
of a business cycle, the more effective
it is likely to be. Indeed one can go
further. If monetary measures are
applied early and gradually, as they have
been this year in face of emerging in-
flationary pressure, interest rate adjust-
ments can effectively be extended rather
further into a period of rising prices than
if they are left until prices are rising
strongly.
This is not to say that, given rising
prices, each further adjustment will not
have to be proportionately bigger to get
a given effect or that, ultimately, should
price movements get out of hand it is
possible interest rate changes will have
no effect at all. If Rowan was playing
down the importance of monetary policy
as an adjustor only in these particular
situations, one could agree with him.
The possible emergence of such situations
is doubtless now exercising the Reserve
Bank at this early stage of price inflation
(see Bulletin, September 5, page 58).
ITowever, Rowan was in fact thinking
in wider terms. One of his main points
was that our understanding of the out-
workings of monetary policy through
time was very incomplete and he thought
money, on research into these effects
would be well spent. This is perfectly
true, though considering the big econo-
mic staffs of the Treasury and the Re-
serve Bank, and the accomplished econo-
mists among them, it must be taken that
a lot of money is already being spent on it.
Also, Rowan put up the idea that the
economy would grow at a faster rate
if we attempted to expand at a rather
more even pace. He suggested, in this
context, that we should try, in a word,
to apply fiscal and monetary policy with
the object of avoiding cyclical boom
heads. Given his lack of faith in mone-
tary policy, this, in his view, would put
the onus mainly on fiscal policy (that is,
first and foremost, taxation) to effect
the necessary dampening, especially of
excessive aggregate demand, on which he
seemed to place much stress as a cause
of these boom heads emerging.
Strangely enough for an academic
economist, Rowan didn't mention the
possible use of planned investment to
help avoid these peaks. This would seem
to be essential if such a policy were to
be successful. Perhaps one is a bit old-
fashioned in this, but if investment is
given its head it is very difficult for an
economy to avoid over-reaching itself
and suffering an aftermath from over-
investment. Maybe, if applied early and
strongly enough, interest rate policy can
still effect the needed containment of
investment in the private sector. It is
essential for it to be supplemented by
careful planning and adjustment of the
overall level of public investment. Mone-
tary policy is pretty helpless on its own.


“CROESUS”
Sweeping the Augean Stables
Stock Exchanges and listing requirements
Tt is easy enough to criticise the Stock
-*■ Exchange for failure to be fully open
with the public about members’ dealings.
But the abuses, such as brokers acting as
principals with first access to news in a
sensitive market or even dealing in shares
without putting the bargains on the offi-
cial record, should not be magnified into
a case for criticising the exchanges for
tightening up their requirements for list-
ing companies.
Some companies, already listed, are
apparently aggrieved that ultimately they
also will have to adhere to the new rules,
and reveal much more about their activi-
ties in the long intervals between report-
ing their annual results. Some, which
have long perpetrated little less than an
affront to their shareholders and the in-
vesting public, on the score of interim
reporting, have stooped to arguing that
unless the Stock Exchange cleans out its
own Augean stables, they see no reason
why they also should mend their ways.
In this frame of mind, what seems to
be a most reasonable requirement, that
companies issue half-yearly reports show-
ing profits and sales on a comparative
basis, is being fiercely attacked. In fact,
the Stock Exchanges really want to go
further and have suggested the issuing
of quarterly reports, albeit not making
this mandatory at present. Despite the
opposition from presently - listed com-
panies, and even if the officers of the
Stock Exchanges get a poor reception
when they go the rounds of these com-
panies in an effort to get them to con-
form, ultimately they will be obliged to
toe the line or to run the risk of being
de-listed.
A s from the beginning of September, the
London Stock Exchange council, also,
has obliged all companies seeking a listing
for their shares to supply half-yearly or
quarterly reports. “If they do not agree to
give such information there will be no
quotation,” says the “Investors’ Chroni-
cle”, which goes to show that, although
there is to be no immediate requirement
for currently listed companies to obey
the new rules, they will only be able to
ignore them for the limited period during
which they do not have to apply for a
quotation for new shares. In the “Inves-
tors’ Chronicle” view, “Rights issues,
scrip issues, share splits, shares issued in
consideration for acquisitions, the issue
of a debenture or stock loan all these
will require a fresh approach to the Stock
Exchange and a promise to adhere to the
new regulations.”
True, no Australian State Companies
Act requires companies to issue half-
yearly reports, except Victoria in the case
of public borrowing corporations. How-
ever, NSW has legislation afoot to make
this obligatory in that State for public
borrowing corporations and other States
are expected to bring in similar legisla-
tion in due course. Moreover, as one has
reported before, at least Victoria’s At-
torney-General, Mr A. G. Rylah, is sym-
pathetic to the case for all companies
to issue half-yearly reports, even if he
prefers to see it applied only to public
borrowing corporations as a start. So all
the Stock Exchanges are doing is to lead
the legislatures in a direction some of
them have indicated is desirable in the
interests of safeguarding investors.
rrtHE Stock Exchanges must be commend-
ed for doing that. With their Aus-
tralia-wide jurisdiction, they were cer-
tainly in the best position to introduce
the reform on a national basis. Clearly,
with some States so pathetically slow in
reforming company law and not yet
abreast with Victoria’s public borrowing
corporation legislation, we will have to
wait quite a long time before it is written
into all the company law of all the States.
While commending the new rules on
most counts, particularly their virtual
extension to all States of the main re-
quirements of Victoria’s Companies
(Public Borrowings) Act 1963, at any
rate so far as listed companies are con-
cerned, it will be interesting to see if
there is any improvement in the immedi-
acy of reporting information to the
Stock Exchanges, as a result of Section 3
of the new rules. This section is not only
thorough in its coverage of matters that
must be reported to the Stock Exchange.
It is also categoric on what must be re-
ported “immediately”.
Unfortunately, in Melbourne at any
rate, a notion has been fostered for some
time now that companies should wait
until after the close of Stock Exchange
business before reporting information.
Most forward in this advocacy have been
the finance editors of Melbourne morning
dailies. They have pressed their point to
the disadvantage, in terms of coverage in
their columns, of any company failing
to follow their line, whether a company
be of national significance or not. Any
company reporting after hours gets their
accolade, sometimes with the phrase
“well after Stock Exchange hours” the
latter presumably being reserved for re-
ports reaching the Stock Exchange too
late for the Stop Press of the city’s one
evening newspaper.
Fliscounting the highly competitive fea-
of financial journalism between
the morning and evening papers in Mel-
bourne, it is not without significance that
in its latest new listing requirements the
London Stock Exchange lays it down
that all preliminary dividend and profit
statements must be made to the Stock
Exchange during trading hours. Perhaps
in Australia, with the short sessions of,
say, the Perth Stock Exchange and the
time lags between eastern and western
States, one wouldn’t insist on that. But
there can be no question of the impor-
tance of making information known to
the Stock Exchanges immediately deci-
sions are made. Equally, decisions should
be made immediately available to all the
Press. Even if local Stock Exchanges are
shut, a wide range of Australian shares
can be bought and sold on international
exchanges which may be open, thus pro-
viding scope for insiders to act on any
information before it is made public here.
While it seems to be generally agreed
that the new rules provide a powerful
backstop to existing company law in
the protection of investors, they are just
about as far as the Stock Exchanges can
go in putting the screw on companies
without impinging on their legitimate
freedom of action in a free enterprise sys-
tem and, equally importantly, without
prejudicing companies against the use of
Stock Exchange facilities One hasn’t
heard of any company likely to seek
voluntary de-listing as a protest against
the rules, and the arbitrary assumption of
power by a private association which lies
behind them. It could happen, though,
and the Stock Exchanges might be well
advised to affect a rather less autocratic
attitude.
Indeed, it must have come home to
them already in this highly buoyant
economy that whatever the value of a
quotation from the companies’ and share-
holders’ viewpoints, very few companies
have found it necessary to raise money
on the Stock Exchanges. Compared, say,
to the halcyon days of new capital issues
on the Stock Exchanges in 1959 and
1960, the current investment boom has
largely by-passed them. Last quarter
(June) only £l9 million of new money
of all descriptions was raised on the
Stock Exchanges, compared with the
record average of £62 million a quarter
in 1959-60 whereas, last quarter, capital
expenditure by companies was £158.6
million compared with an average of
only £ll2 million a quarter in 1959-60.

A Developing Need for Air Freight
“The Cinderella of the Airways " is growing slowly
Amid the furore last week on the loss
by Airlines of NSW (a division of
Ansett Transport Industries Ltd)
of its Sydney-Dubbo route, little atten-
tion was paid to what is an important
part of an airline’s revenue—air freight.
Called by some users the Cinderella
of the airways, air freight has become
less and less a part of Ansett-ANA and
TAA operations when compared to the
passenger miles flown. While the num-
ber of passengers carried rises every
year, the freight figures have either fallen
or remained static. From a total of
85,446 short tons of freight carried in
1955-56 the figure has subsided to
61,616 tons in 1963.
Of this latest figure Ansett-ANA car-
ried 31,757 tons and TAA 21,552 tons.
Officially the airlines claim the fall in
air freight tonnages has been due to
competition from other forms of trans-
port and name specifically the Princess
of Tasmania and the Bass Trader which
ply between the mainland and Tasmania.
However, it is claimed that the real
reason is that air cargo services are still
inadequate. Apparently there is still a
need to improve air freight services for
urgent and perishable goods, but delays
and the big time lapse between airport
and destination have cut tonnages back.
Both Ansett and TAA have recently
paid a little more attention to air freight
and have opened up extra city collection
points. The effect of this is not known
yet but it should bring the cargo/passen-
ger revenue ratio into more reasonable
balance. According to a TAA spokes-
man, air cargo revenue represents 15 per
cent of that line’s revenue. He adds it
should rise to 25 per cent in six or seven
years.
The chairman of Pan American Air-
ways, Mr Juan T. Trippe, said recently
that the day was not far off when income
from passengers and cargo would be
equal. TAA says his statement referred
to the international, not the domestic,
icene, but the local ratio is
in for big changes.
In broad terms one could
call the combined Australian
interstate cargo-passenger air
services a “competitive mono-
poly” for nearly all flights are
duplicated and leave at the
same time. They must offer
exactly the same passenger and
freight rates under the orders
of the International Air Tran-
sport Association. Any conces-
sional rates applied to commo-
dities must be agreed to by air-
lines competing over the same
routes before they can become
effective.
Perhaps it is because of this that
interstate airline officials are reluctant to
talk. The Bulletin had great difficulty
in getting even small amounts of in-
formation from them as to why air
freight was a fourth-rate revenue-earner
and why tonnages overall showed a
general downward trend.
One observer, vitally interested in the
development of air freight in Australia,
said he felt that airlines would agree that
air freight came last on the list of priori-
ties. Ranking ahead of freight are
passengers, mail, and air express freight.
While there has been an overall de-
crease in Australia’s internal air freight,
the trend with world airlines has been
up. The following table gives an idea
of what has been happening.

A spokesman for Qantas said interna-
tional air cargo was growing at about
15.3 per cent a year while Australian
internal air cargo was growing at about
11.9 per cent. He said at this rate it
was quite possible in the future for cargo
revenue to exceed passenger revenue
“but I would not like to put any date
on it. At present foodstuffs are our
greatest export, followed by orchids to
the States”.
With international airlines the pro-
blem of return cargoes is the biggest
headache. Said Qantas: “At present
there is strong demand for air cargo on
the main trade routes into Australia
from the UK and Europe, Japan and
the US. It is a long-haul demand and
consequently more economical than a
short-haul contract. In other words you
can generally rely on full loads into
Australia.
Australian Internal Air Freight
“However, Australia’s export cargoes
have not developed a sufficient demand
to provide full cargo planes. Nor have
intermediate countries’ exports given us
sufficient sector loads. But there have
been improvements in this in the last
four years. On the westbound Kangaroo
route it is beginning to come more into
balance because of the incentive of rates
which are offered to the producers.”
The biggest air-freight line in the
world, Pan American Airways, in 1963
earned 410,677,00 dollars from pas-
sengers and 54,395,000 dollars from
cargo. The previous year passengers
brought in 365,129,000 dollars, cargo
49,719,000 dollars.
Mr Rush S. Clark, district traffic sales
manager for Pan Am. in Sydney, said
the growth in air freight coming to
Australia was basically tied to the growth
of the economy. “The country is be-
coming more diversified and it has a
greater need to bring more things in
from overseas. In this regard compe-
tition has been a big help. Because of
the wider range of goods now available
there is greater need for spare parts and
they must be brought here quickly.”
Mr Clarke said the problem of return
loads from Australia to America was
difficult. “Since Australia’s economy is
based on agricultural products which are
high weight-low cost, there is not, at
present, a great deal of cargo to be
carried by air. Our problem is to find a
series of exports from Australia to
Europe and the US. The growing trade
in finished textiles may help to solve
this.”
Mr Gordon Barton, a director of
Interstate Parcels Express Co. Pty Ltd,
which is headquartered in Adelaide,
believes there is room in Australia for
an airline which will deal solely with
freight. He does not believe that falling
air freight tonnages Ansett-ANA and
TAA are carrying are due to com-
petition from sea, rail and road. “They
have not developed air freight to the
point where it is efficient and where they
can offer customers a service comparable
with the rates they are paying.”
In December last year and
January this year, IPEC sent
1000 questionnaires to organis-
ations using, known to have
used or thought to be potential
users of interstate air freight.
The questionnaire asked their
views on whether “Australian
industry in general and your
business in particular are at
present adequately served by
the existing air freight services
and whether you support the
setting up of an all-cargo air
service by IPEC.” A total of 381
replies was received. In answer
to the first question, 29 said ye s >

290 said no. To the second question,
305 answered yes, 14 answered no.
Here are some comments selected at
random from the replies IPEC received:
“In our view, existing air freight services
are not adequate by virtue of the uncer-
tainty of pick-up and delivery within
prescribed times.” “We have in the past
found the existing air-freight service far
too slow for our requirements.” “In
times of heavy air traffic, delays can go
on for two or three days—without
advice.”
The general tenor of the replies was
that present air-freight services had their
value destroyed by unreliability, slow-
ness and delays between the airport and
destination. Many of those who
answered IPEC said they favored the
setting up of an all-cargo airline.
Mr Barton said his company had for-
warded the replies to the Department
of Civil Aviation together with an appli-
cation to import five aeroplanes to be
used on cargo runs throughout Australia.
“We were not all that optimistic when
we first thought about this venture but
now that things are moving we have had
a lot of support. Six months ago I’d
say we had an outsider’s chance —now it
is odds-on. When the cargo service
starts we do not intend to take existing
air freight from Ansett and TAA; we
intend to develop our own markets.
“For instance, the area round Gympie
and Redland Bay in Queensland has
first-class market produce. The people
there are very keen indeed to develop a
market in Melbourne where they fre-
quently can get better prices than they
can in Brisbane. Present air freight ser-
vices do not enable them to get their
produce to market in a fresh state unless
they pay express rates.
“Therefore we believe we can interest
them in rapid air freight. Several
breweries have shown interest in air-
fr ighted hops from Tasmania. At pre-
sent they are shipped under refrigera-
tion but apparently hops are not as fresh
after refrigeration. Air freight would
solve this problem.
“The fruit industry in Tasmania and
fishermen’s co-operatives in Tasmania
and Western Australia have also shown
interest in our scheme.”
Mr Barton said IPEC had investigated
seven different types of planes with a
view to importing them for cargo ser-
vice. The investigations revealed:
Depreci- Operating
ation cost per
period ton-mile
Argosy Avro
Whitworth 8 years 13.7 d.
Bristol Britannia
(converted) 5 years 9.3 d.
Canadair CL44 8 years 9,8 d.
Douglas DC3 3 years 23.7 d.
" DC4 4 years 13.2 d.
" DC6 A or B 5 years 9.7 d.
" DC7 B or C 5 years 9.4 d.
He said although the Douglas DC4
was not the cheapest plane to operate
per ton-mile, his company had applied
for permission to import five of them
because he felt they would have more
success in importing a plane that was
well known in Australia and which
could be readily serviced. “After they
have been written off we will seek per-
mission to import a plane that is bigger
and cheaper to operate —probably Cana-
dair’s CL44,
“The main transport traffic at present
is between Sydney and Melbourne and to
a lesser extent between Melbourne and
Adelaide and Sydney and Brisbane. We
expect to get the biggest business with
air freight between capital cities that are
not adjacent. With air freight we can
cut delivery times by half. Whereas it
now takes two days for cargo to get
from Sydney to Adelaide, Melbourne to
Brisbane, Sydney to Tasmania and so on,
the time will be reduced to a few hours.
“We expect to build up a very large
volume of trade in perishables. This
traffic tends to come from areas where
industrial trade is not very heavy and
consequently is relatively poorly served
by transport. Another big use will be
for airline distribution where a company,
instead of operating warehouses in cities
all over Australia, will operate from a
central city and despatch orders when
they are received.
“One company has already done this.
It ran a warehouse in Launceston but
found that when it brought out new
models of the goods it was making there
was a large carryover of old stock. It
closed down the Launceston operation
and now sends orders as they are re-
ceived. Even though air freight is more
expensive than sea freight, it found it
was saving money in the long run.
“Getting the planes is rather a prob-
lem. As the DC4 is pretty old, there
are not many of them available. We
were looking at two in Japan but we did
not have an import licence and TAA
and Ansett got them. There was one in
America but that went off too. There
was a good one in England but TAA
has bought it since.
“The operation in its first year will
cost about £575,000, including the planes
and hangars. In addition we are under-
taking a big building programme to
handle the increased traffic we expect.
The Melbourne and Adelaide buildings
are nearly finished and we’re just about
to start in Launceston. It looks like
there’ll be no shortage of pilots for the
job. The number of applications we’ve
had already from highly qualified men
more than fill the 30 vacancies for
pilots.”
The need for an all-cargo airline, said
Mr Barton, is shown by the success of
the air service it runs between Tasmania
and the mainland. IPEC charters three
DC3s a night to carry cargo over this
route “but we have run out of capacity”.

MARKET POINTERS
Imports Warning Confirmed
Warnings on the rising trend of im-
ports were confirmed when the
August figures were published. Record
imports again point to the increased
competition likely to occur this year,
with a consequent effect on company
earning rates.
★ ★ ★
Another short term money market
dealer, National Discount Corpora-
tion Ltd (75 p.c. owned by National
Mutual Life), has reported a sharp drop
in earnings after the slide in bond prices
in the June quarter, when the bond
market was being groomed for higher
interest rates.
Discount Corporation of Australia
Ltd reported the same ailment last
month.
The short term money market dealers,
of course, must buy bonds as backing for
the money they accept on deposit. Their
profit comes from the margin of interest
on the money they accept and the interest
return on the bonds they buy. When
the bonds fall in price, however, there
is a capital loss.
Not all the dealers were caught. But
the results published so far indicate that
the share market should be cautious in
assessing profit figures for this group, at
least in 1963-64.
★ ★ ★
"11/lascot Industries Ltd, which sprang
1 A from the old tallow group, Gearin
O’Riordan, confounded the pessimists
with a sharp lift in earning rate from
23.1 p.c. to 26.2 p.c.
The market had been expecting poor
results from the hotel-motel side of its
activities. Apparently the results of
Coach House Motor Inns Ltd were ex-
cluded from the consolidated profits
when Mascot reduced its 60 p.c. hold-
ings in Coach House by selling part of
its holding to Tooheys Ltd last May. .
★ ★ ★
Union Assurance Co.
of Australia is defying the down-
ward trend in insurance company profits
by publishing a rise in earning rate to
14.2 p.c. and lifting its dividend from
7h p.c. to 8 p.c.
The ss. shares offer a market yield of
only 2.4 p.c. but, if the rate of profit
growth continues, the market will not be
disappointed.
★ ★ ★
Ltd, the Sydney-based credit
retailer, has indicated it will branch
out heavily in Melbourne, with a new
city department store, two suburban de-
partment stores and eight new homeware
stores in metropolitan Melbourne to be
launched soon.
Cost of the big invasion into Mel-
bourne town is given as the reason for
the drop in the group’s earning rate
from 24.7 p.c. to 20.7 p.c. in the year
to July 31.
With a one-for-six new share issue
last August, there is extra capital to
feed. It may be some time yet before
the Melbourne stores start earning their
keep.
Obviously a lot will depend on the
success of the Melbourne expansion and
investors should keep a close watch on
this side of activities in 1964-65 in an
effort to anticipate results for next year.
It suggests that the market in Waltons
may provide better buying opportunities
at a later date.


Tired of the
Executive
Rat-Race?
WELL, GET OUT OF IT!
The longer you ‘sit’ on a job the
harder it looks. Any good executive
knows that. Yet decisions are put
off by the thousand every day.
‘Difficult’ jobs go into the ‘too
hard’ basket.
This procrastination is like a disease
in business. It’s the by-product of
the Executive Life. The pressure
goes on the strain gets tougher
the mind often flags. Result?
Work looks harder so takes more
out of you. So the mind flags more.
The rat-race is on.
A mind under pressure needs good
care. The executive life tension,
worry, hurried unbalanced meals,
alcohol often leads to a deficiency
of essential B Group vitamins.
These are the vitamins —BI in
particular which have a signifi-
cant effect in conserving nervous
energy. Additional B 1 is often pres-
cribed during periods of physical
stress and excessive mental activity.
You may not get adequate Vitamin
B from your meals. The drinks you
have to relax you, increase your
needs still further.
It’s comparatively easy to stop the
rat-race and get off. But you must
make a decision. You must put
yourself on to ‘TAB-VITA’ B

potent source of B group vitamins
enriched with Vitamin C. It is not
a miracle ‘cure’ but if taken regularly

INVESTMENT SECTION
Petersville Predicts Rosy Future
Food competition really needs watching
At their present depressed levels, the
2s. Petersville (formerly Peters Ice
Cream) shares could prove bargain buy-
ing in the long run. The setback ex-
perienced by the company in 1963-64
should only be temporary. Profit
crumpled from a peak £833,000 to
£579,000. Earning rate came back from
18.7 p.c. to 12.9 p.c., so the dividend
has been cut from 15 p.c. to 12} p.c.
The factors which eroded profits are
basically non-recurring and directors
expect 1964-65 performance and divi-
dend to return to “normal” levels. In
fact, the chairman, Mr E. Christensen,
held a special “getting to know you”
Press conference, soon after the results
were released, in order to emphasise the
temporary nature of the poor 1963-64
result and to impress upon the news-
papers his firm belief in the rosy future
of the group.
The main cause of the setback was a
£200,000 loss on the stocks of a frozen
food subsidiary, Hy-Peak. Handling
agents had not rotated their incoming
deliveries properly, so that a consider-
able amount of stock never found its
way out of storerooms once it had been
received. Most of this had to be des-
troyed as below quality. The rest of the
setback arose from expenditure on new
products and the cost of moving to new
premises near Springvale—during which
time the old Burnley factory was still
operating. Operating two factories
where only one is really necessary is
never very economical!
These items should not crop up this
year, and economies should derive from
a full term's use of the new, modern and
highly integrated Springvale establish-
ment.
The chief danger facing the group is
the competition, which is growing stead-
ily, mainly against its non ice cream
lines. Back in 1959, all profits came
from ice cream. At present, diversifi-
cation has reached the stage where ice
cream contributes only 40 p.c. of net
profit. About 30 p.c. comes from the
general and frozen food operations,
while 121 p.c. odd comes both from
dairy activities and the pastry and pie
division. “Peters” brand ice cream
holds around 66 p.c. of the market.
While the ice cream business remains
highly profitable, most other lines are
meeting more competition every year.
Frozen foods are especially up against it.
There are numerous small firms in the
business, many of which appear to be
growing—Frozen Foods and Piet were
recent flotations to the public list.
Nestles is now moving into the baby
foods field (Peters makes Edgell baby
foods) and Herbert Adams is making a
big noise about its recently introduced
pies. On top of all this is the intense
interest which the Australian food indus-
try holds for many big overseas groups.
Of course, the growing market which
these foods are finding will help Peters-
ville maintain the profitability of its own
lines. But directors will need to be
right on their toes if they hope to main-
tain their present market percentages in
the various food fields.
Reservations on Felts
markets preferred to stay un-
A moved by Felt and Textiles of Aus-
tralia’s quite favorable result, holding
the ss. shares at 9s. where the yield
on the long-secure 10 p.c. dividend is
5.6 p.c. Prices will hardly hit the year’s
best of 9s. 6d. unless something about
a striking future programme emerges
from the annual meeting.
Investors probably still wait to be
stimulated with a more positive use of
funds derived from the South African
subsidiary sale. Perhaps they feel a
slow trickle through the group, large
and diverse as it is, and the first-fruit
investment in Ark Rubber are not
promising enough.
Those qualms aside, 1963-64’s profit
was certainly nothing to be ashamed of.
At £1,003,255, earnings got reasonably
close to the previous year’s record
£1,079,815. Tax provision of £1,008,106
just topped the latest profit as well (last
year, tax took £834,062).
Earning rate, on higher average
capital, goes from 19.4 to 14.9 p.c.-'
perhaps too much of a cry from 1960 s
24.8 p.c.

All in all, South Africa wasn’t so
sorely missed. Group sales totalled £42
million, some £3.3 million below the
1962-63 aggregate yet producing a £5
million rise if South Africa is excluded.
Most strikingly, Australian sales rep-
resented a 66 p.c. advance on the
previous year and New Zealand’s 17i
p.c.
Within the rather variable textile field,
the exact distribution of the sales among
Felt’s range of activities should prove
significant for the sharemarket.
Tough Going for AMI
11/'ith the automotive industry opera-
" ting at peak levels, Australian
Motor Industries managed to chalk-up
a vastly improved result for 1963-64.
Performance is still far from satisfac-
tory. Following the thumping loss in
1961 of more than £2 million, and de-
ficits of £378,000 and £59,000 in 1962
and 1963, a profit of some £228,000 has
been earned. It equals 10.5 p.c. on
ordinary capital.
In 1960, before the losses, earning
rate was 13.4 p.c., from which a 10 p.c.
dividend was paid, although the result
was a substantial comeback from the
previous year.
The company is in nothing like an
ordinary dividend paying position as yet.
The 10.5 p.c. earning rate is calculated
after deducting £36,000 for preference
charges. These will not be paid this
year, however. Instead, preference
arrears for 1961 and 1962 will be caught
up with, resulting in a £72,000 outlay.
Another £72,000 is thus still owing for
1963 and 1964, and must be met in
future.
Actually, the £228,000 profit will not
have to be touched in order to meet the
1961 and 1962 preference arrears. The
result includes £36,000 in duty refunds
from prior years, £41,000 profit on fixed
asset sales and £9OOO in provisions no
longer required. So in actual figures,
forgetting accounting, the year's surplus
was some £314,000. The preference
£72,000 is the only deduction and leaves
directors with £242,000 to play with in
the current year.
They could have easily paid off the
extra £72,000 for preferences. There
is little doubt, though, that they need to
maintain liquidity at the highest possible
rate. The company’s future looks rather
ominous. To start with, this latest result
is completely unsatisfactory as to the
servicing of capital. In future years,
performance may not be much better,
once the £2 million in tax losses peters
out. Many observers see this as a most
likely possibility and feel that a capital
write-down may be the only answer.
Then, again, it is fairly obvious that
the 1964 result was mainly due to AMl’s
increasing reliance on the assembly and

figures for the second half-year show
declines for Triumphs and Standards,
very sharp in the latter case. Ramblers
rose from 413 to 690. However, Toyotas
jumped from 46 to 1687. These were the
“Tiara” and the “700”. Soon, the
“Crown Special” will be assembled here
too. It will sell for only £lO more than
a Holden.
So it is obvious that future profits are
going to depend primarily on the
Japanese business. This is the only hope
for full rejuvenation, an adequate ser-
vicing of profits and reasonable divi-
dends. This hope is not very stable.
Already there are moves afoot to bump
up import duties in an effort to lower
the dynamic competition which the
Japanese vehicles have the potential to
create. Already, they have caused minor
upsets on the local scene.
How much local manufacturers are
going to take, and the future nature of
our trade relations with Japan, are both
unknown factors which are vital to the
future of AMI. External factors, not
internal reorganisation, will be the main
thing in making or breaking the firm.
Second Century Injustice
1964 result from Second Century
A Corporation, factoring affiliate of
Melbourne stockbroking firm Wm Noall
and Son, smacks of irresponsibility. A
loss was incurred on the year. Back at
the beginning of March, directors said
the second half-year should be satis-
factory. The first half-year had seen
a slightly lower profit, but only because
of taxation increases. So, it seems that
the crash from a performer with earn-
ings of 13.7 p.c. in 1963 to a loss com-
pany all happened in the four months
from last March to June 30.
Granting this, why did directors say
nothing to shareholders via the Press
and the stock exchange as to the plight
the firm was in. No one knew a thing
about it until the annual results were
released recently. Many suspected.
There were obviously leakages of
some sort, because the 10s. shares fell
steadily from 13s. 9d. at the beginning
of August to 7s. 9d. the day before the
accounts were out. Such a strong
downward trend suggests that inspired
selling was turning the stories of the
company’s misfortunes into more than
just a rumor on the market.
To confuse this picture further, the
figures released make it rather difficult
to calculate the year’s true loss—£77s
or £70,775. It seems that the latter
figure may be more accurate. The
£70,000 difference represents a transfer
from an assets revaluation reserve to the
provision for doubtful debts. This pro-
vision is in addition to £19,000 already
provided, and probably reflects the fact
that £59,000 was written off in bad
debts in 1963-64, compared with
£lO,OOO in 1963.
It must also reflect another alarming
fact —factoring activities, the company’s
main profit source, are to be wound up.
Although this is probably a wise move,
having regard to the general lack of
success of factoring in Australia, it
means that some time could lapse before
the company regains its feet. It will
probably suffer from over-capitalisation
until the remaining subsidiaries are
expanded or more fully developed.
The two best known subsidiaries are
Colmax Electric, an electrical contractor,
and the Continental Instrument Co., a
manufacturer of self-service petrol
pumps. The annual report, it is hoped,
will reflect on the potential of these
subsidiaries and provide some justifica-
tion for the apparent irresponsibility
which preceded the recent release of
the year’s results.
Stronger Alliance
A lliance Holdings’ shareholders won’t
need to lose any sleep over the news
that the group is tending to write a good
deal more property mortgage and
bridging finance paper. That safer path
seems to be trodden by quite a few other
hire-purchase houses these days.
Not that Alliance has slipped in its
purely hire transactions, though. During
the latest year ended June 30, those out-
standings went up by £5.1 million to
£20.3 million.
Of the total outstandings, which moved
£7.3 million higher to £24.9 million,
only £4.6 million represents paper not
including interest or hiring charges. Yet
the jump here was £2.6 million.
Monthly collections are coming in at
the rate of more than £l3 million a
year, to stand healthily against almost
£6 million borrowings which mature
within twelve months. Total borrowings
at June 30 reached £17.3 million.
The year’s profit climbed by £20,307
to a record £320,420, edging earning
rate from 16.2 to 16.4 p.c. Dividend at
the 10 p.c. paid since 1962 possesses a
good cover.
Alliance effected a cash purchase of
more than 90 p.c. of Brisbane-based
Retailers Acceptance’s capital near the
finish of the 1963-64 year, thus com-
pleting representation in all mainland
States and the ACT. Retailers Accep-
tance has since become fully owned.
The ss. shares remain largely un-
disturbed around 10s., though they have
touched 11s. this year. The MLC holds
a 49.1 p.c. interest in Alliance.
On the Right Track
tPhe Bulletin of July 4 (page 59)
pointed out that Mayne Nickless
would have to boost profit to around
£508,000 in 1966-67 in order to main-
tain earnings around the current 20 p.c.
levels. This calculation was based on
three assumptions. First, that no further
shares are issued for takeover purposes!
Second, that the P & O shipping group
does not exercise an option on July 1,
1966, to take out more shares in the

company. Third, that shareholders see
no further share issues between now and
then.
The lift to £508,000 will be necessary
because of the big jumps to be scored
by share capital, thanks to the Metro
Industries takeover and the scrip yet
to be issued to P & O, in instalments,
to give it a 20 p.c. interest. As things
turn out, the 1963-64 result, released
last week, represents a substantial step
toward this £508,000 goal. Profit rose
from £323,000 to £404,000. Dividend
will be continued at 12i p.c., the lower
rate established last year after a bonus
and cash issue.
In the current year, a similar gain
could be scored as Metro Industries will
be incorporated for a full year. But it
will also be vital for the buoyant trans-
port industry to continue as such, in
order to maintain profitability and to
create favorable investment venues for
the employment of any instalments
coming from P & O for the rest of its
shares.
The £508,000 target is still a distant
one, but the company is on the right
track. Any decline in the activity ot
the transport industry could put this goal
completely out of reach and reduce earn-
ing rates. Although the 20 p.c. earnings
would have to fall heavily before en-
dangering the 12i p.c. dividend, the
company must fight to maintain per-
formance in order to justify its rapid
expansion and share issuing of recent
times.
Bisley on Target
Oisley Clothing looks well set to
exceed last year’s £45,158 profit,
which produced an earning rate of 21.3
p.c. Sales for the first half of the current
year, that is to June 30, moved up by
31 p.c. on the corresponding period of
1963. Orders are also higher.
The company has been noted for a
lively sense of innovation. Directors now
report success from the introduction of
panel shirts, in synthetic fabric. The
new line has ied to an expansion of
export sales as well.
A range of complete wash-and-wear
garments is being made from Fibre-
makers’ fabrics.
Retention of a steady 5 p.c. interim
dividend didn’t lift the ss. shares, at
7s. 6d., much above the year’s low of
7s. 3d. They have seen a top Bs. 6d. for
1964 and Bs. 9d. for 1963.
Slap in the Face
Components’ result for
1963-64 was a real slap in the face
for shareholders. Profit is down from
£165,000 to £92,000 and the dividend
will be cut from 10 p.c. to 7 p.c. Great
things, or at least a small profit lift,
were expected from the company,
especially as the automotive industry
has been moving along at high levels
over the past months.
The report provided a classic case for
the encouragement of the Melbourne
Stock Exchange’s recommendations on
the making of quarterly reports. Share-
holders last heard of the company’s pro-
gress in February’s interim statement.
Directors said sales were up 10 p.c.,
profits were satisfactory and prospects
fox final six months were good. How-
ever, there may be confusion involved
here, as their statement on profits was
made after “allowing for expenses in
the establishment of new outlets”.
Most people thought this meant profits
had been maintained despite these extra
expenses. Apparently directors meant
they were satisfactory, although they
were lower because of these establish-
ment expenses.
The situation should have been more
clearly stated, especially as the chair-

man had referred to the “bright” future
prospects at last year’s annual meeting.
The seriousness of this misunderstand-
ing is more fully reflected in the fact
that a prominent Melbourne stockbroking
firm issued a comprehensive survey on
the company to clients only last month.
The survey put the company in a very
favorable light. Although it referred
essentially to the longer term, several
clients will undoubtedly be rather irate
if they put in buying orders on the

Sims Ltd are not recommending an
ordinary dividend out of its much-
improved profit, investors have expressed
some confidence in this scrap metal
merchant's future by upping the shares
a little to ss. 7d.
Six months ago share prices hovered
around 4s. 4d. after the announcement
that profit for the half-year to Decem-
ber, 1963, was £207,596 before tax.
The latest release from the company
shows it has turned a loss of £153,437
for the year to June 30, 1963, into a
profit of £287,401, giving an 8.9 p.c.
earning rate.
Tax provision was £195,474 (£8345
the previous year) and depreciation
£230,394 (£236,670). In addition, Sims
absorbed a loss of £54,463 incurred by
the MV Wcingatiella (now in the hands
of its fifth owner, it is a floating hostel
for workers on the Lake Manapouri
hydro-electricity project in New Zea-
land). Obsolete equipment to the value
of £23,881 was written off and a further
amount of £30,000 was charged against
profit “as a provision for loss on sale
of assets surplus to requirements”.
Investors are wondering exactly what
use can be made of the group’s tax
losses, which mainly derive from the
Hons Kong shipping subsidiary.
Pye’s Saving Grace
Dye Industries Ltd directors’ forecast
of lower results came true. In sym-
pathy, the market lowered prices to
around the 235. 6d. mark —a drop of
some 2s. 6d. or (perhaps coincidentally)
about 10 p.c.
Coincidentally, because Pye’s profit fell
by about 10 p.c.—in cold hard figures
from £328,449 to £294,221. Every-
thing is down but the dividend, a saving
grace for investors.
Apart from the reduced profit, tax
provision is down by £141,797 to
£180,474 and depreciation down £5245
to £103,908.
Yet shareholders should not be overly
critical of Pye’s results. The electrical

should be in line for improved results

It may take more than a year to make
itself felt but the replacement side of
the business must give companies in the
field a great deal of hope.
Packaging Helps Aldus
Tj\>llowing on from APM’s successful
year, thanks mainly to its connection
with the growing packaging industry,
Aldus has turned in a healthy result and
intends making a three-for-ten issue in
November. It will be used to finance
further expansion. The company is the
public parent for the Seligson and Clare
printing, paper converting and packag-
ing equipment group. Machine tools,
engineers’ supplies and woodworking
equipment are also handled.
The issue of 10s. shares will raise
£140,000 in capital and £210,000 in
premiums (15s. a share). Even at this
high premium, there will still be a tidy
capital gain for shareholders. The scrip
was collecting 475. before the announce-
ment was made. No doubt the total
£350,000-odd raised will be mainly used
for expanding those activities connected
with packaging.
Directors have predicted that the
steady 14 p.c. annual payment will not
be reduced after the issue, which will
boost paid capital to £609,000. Small
worry in this direction, anyway, as the
1964 profit, £174,000, represented 34.9
p.c. on capital, compared with 32.9 p.c.
last year.
Solid Queenslander
XTearly every year since it was formed,
Queensland United Foods Ltd has
turned in a higher result than the
previous one. The latest profit is no ex-
ception—it moves up pleasingly by 11.3
p.c. to £380,297, a record.
Formed in 1960 by the merger of
Peters-Arctic Delicacy Co. Ltd, Peters
Arctic Delicacy Co. (NQ) Ltd and
Pauls Ltd, QUF has suffered only one
profit setback. In 1961 earnings moved
back fractionally from £260,514 to
£255,523. For the first three years of
its trading, it paid a 10 p.c. dividend. It
paid 11 p.c. in 1963 and continues this
handout in the latest year.
The 1963-64 result remains after
£304,450 tax (£37,565 higher than last
year) and depreciation £399,230 (up
£22,615). Earning rate increases from
16.1 p.c. to 16.9 p.c.
Shares are available at present around
155., where the yield is 3.7 p.c.
More Loot from Lanes
T ane’s Motors’ result to June 30 came
as no surprise. Profit rose 14 p.c.
from £173,000 to £198,000, a new
record. The company is Melbourne-
based as a distributor of BMC and Mer-
cedes-Benz vehicles. The result was
foreshadowed in March’s interim report.
It said profit had risen 12 p.c. over the
six months and directors expected a
similar pattern to continue through the
final half-year.
Ffowever, the dividend lift from an
already high 171 p.c. to 20 p.c. caught
most investors unawares. Few were ex-
pecting such a move, especially seeing
last year’s rate had already been boosted
substantially from 121 p.c. That lift
followed a colossal jump in profit from
£105,000 to £173,000.
Wright Way With Taxes
’WT'alter Wright’s 1963 -64 result
’’ suggests that taxes may take a
decent chunk out of profits in 1964-65.
Despite a profit increase from £31,000
to £44,000, and a boost in the earning
rate from 16.3 p.c. to 21.3 p.c., dividend
will stay at a heavily covered 10 p.c.

This was paid even in 1962, when earn-
ings touched a low of 13.7 p.c.
The tax figure seems to be the reason
behind the situation, which is made less
savoury when one considers that share-
holders suffered from a £25,000 place-
ment of ss. shares at a substantial
premium late in the year. Despite the
higher result, tax dropped from nearly
£14,000 to slightly more than £13,000,
thanks to the losses of a subsidiary
acquired during the year.
The fact that shareholders will not
benefit from the buoyant results suggests
that tax will be more normal this year
and profits are likely to provide a
narrower cover for the dividend. If an
increased payout was made, the cover
could be scant indeed. The company
operates from Melbourne as an engineer
and cartage contractor.
Nothing Like Leather
T eather merchant George Pizzey
looks set for an issue of some sort.
Nothing has been done for shareholders’
capital since 1950-51, when a one-for-
one bonus was made. At balance date,
1963, paid capital absorbed only
£755,000 of the £2.4 million share-
holders’ funds, so there was plenty of
scope for an issue under similar terms.
At balance date this year, that position
must have been even more favorable.
Profit, released last week, moves up
from £142,000 to £174,000, to equal a
buoyant 25.2 p.c. on capital. Dividend
will be maintained at last year’s 12 p.c.
rate. From 1950-51 until last year, the
rate has always been 10 p.c.
The company has seen unprecedented
prosperity in recent years. After the
£llB,OOO profit in 1950-51, the figure
failed to top £lOO,OOO until 1958-59.
Now the result is climbing rapidly to-
ward the £200,000 mark. Surely it’s
about time for shareholders to take part
in this improvement.
Sam Allen Moves Up
Queensland merchant and transport
agent Samuel Allen and Sons Ltd
following a good year has increased its
annual dividend to 9i p.c. In March
this year it announced a 4 p.c. interim
and has followed it up with a final 5
p.c.—last year’s handout totalled 9 p.c.
Profit is up £24,303 to £146,176 after
tax of £113,224 (up £32,768) and de-
preciation £42,129 (up £2840). Earning
rate on total capital climbs to 14.5 p.c.
from 12.1 p.c. on the previous year’s
result.
It is calling up the final ss. a share
payable by March 31, 1965, on the
issued £1 contributions. In April next
year directors plan a split of the present
£1 shares into 10s. units.
Charm from Chalmers
the Melbourne-based car-
rier and storage operator, saw a
successful 1963-64. Earning rate is up
from 20.2 p.c. to 20.8 p.c. on capital
increased by a one-for-five premium is-
sue during the year Dividend will be
maintained at 12J p.c. on the scrip.
Prospects for the current year are
really good and shareholders may see
some extra benefits. Directors say the
year has opened well. The main profit
booster should be the newly acquired
Sievwright cartage business, specialising
in concrete pipes, beams and bridge
slabs. As this was acquired only in
July, its results will not be reflected until
1964-65 earnings are out.
Economies should derive, and maybe
even extra business, now that a new
building at North Melbourne has been
brought into operation. This was not
done until just near the end of the
financial year, so any effect on profits
from this move will also be unknown
until the 1964-65 result is available.

Doomsday for Marehants?
jV/Jarchants' shareholders won’t be left with much if the
agreement reached between their board, the company’s
receivers and British Tobacco is approved by creditors and
put into operation. British Tobacco hopes to buy the Mel-
bourne and Sydney soft-drink subsidiaries for £708,000 cash.
This will just about pay off all creditors and leave shareholders
with nothing but two other subsidiaries —Marehants Foods and
Food Processing Plant.
At least 6d. a share could have been collected from the
tobacco company’s original bid. Now they’ll be lucky to see
anything for a long while. Marehants Foods was closed down
about a year ago after losing nearly £53,000 on its first five
months of trading in the 1963-64 year to March 31. Food
Processing made a profit of about £13,000 on the year. This
is the shareholders’ only hope.
The subsidiary makes various types of machinery which it
sells to food processors. The Bulletin has heard that there
is much room for improvement in the way the business has
been run. There would need to be, as £13,000 is not going
to provide much of a return on shareholders’ capital. Directors
say the enterprise is active and intend to make a further
announcement as soon as its future is known.
Of course, the whole affair adds another feather to the
cap of the brilliant diversification tactics being followed by
the British Tobacco board. They will get the famous Marehants
and Zyp brand names, together with all the operating assets
and a swag of losses good for tax deductions. They shouldn’t
find it particularly hard to put both firms back on their feet.
Marehants, especially, should provide few problems, as the
chief troublemaker has been a lack of liquid funds, a situation
easily remedied by British Tobacco. Zyp, Marehants and the
70 p.c. interest in Shelleys will all be controlled by Associated
Products and Distribution, a newly - established subsidiary.
With these three competitors all in the one camp, considerable
economies and other obvious advantages should not be hard
to find.
Dodge Rewards Shareholders
almost doubled profit by Dodge Consolidated Industries
Ltd, printer and carton maker, is good news for share-
holders who have seen their ss. shares, listed in 1960, increase
five-fold in market value, received a one-for-five bonus issue
last year and now receive a 16f- p.c. dividend (equal to 20 p.c.
on pre-bonus capital).
Profit jumped from £120,914 to £240,723 after tax of
£146,315 (£44,496 last year) and depreciation £154,064
(£46,556). It was earned on capital increased during the year
from £395,709 to £879,082. This included the issue of
1,150,000 ordinary shares (or 32.7 p.c. of total capital) to
British Tobacco. Dividend requirement is still adequately
covered even though earning rate moves down from 30.6 to
27.4 p.c.
Notes accompanying the preliminary report say the upward
trend in sales has been maintained throughout the year. It
has continued in the first two months of the current year.
The shares, now priced at 255., return a 3.3 p.c. dividend
yield and 5.5 p.c. on earnings.
Acid Taste from Sugar
old saying, “The market is always right”, is generally a
good rule-of-thumb guide to investment. Yet one can’t
help thinking the market was a little savage in slashing the
price of Millaquin Sugar Co. Ltd six shillings in two days,
following the announcement of a 27 p.c. profit increase and a
maintained 20 p.c. dividend on capital increased by a one-for-
three bonus issue.
The day after the announcement the price fell 2s. to 525.
and the next day a further 4s. was removed to bring them
back to 48s. Perhaps investors worried about the reduced
earning rate for the year to June 30, though it moved down
only fractionally—-from 38.2 p.c. to 36.3 p.c. A more likely
explanation of the harsh way these highly respected shares
were handled is that people are thinking that sugar will not
experience as big a boom in the current financial year as it
did last year.
The boom is reflected in Millaquin’s details. During the
year it crushed 531,372 tons of cane, 356,930 at Millaquin
and 174,442 at Qunaba. This was 42,543 tons less than last
year. The company managed to up profit £92,465 to
£435,918, nearly double that earned two years ago.
And this latest profit remained after steep increases in pro-
visions. Tax is up £lOO,OOO to £330,000, depreciation is up
£71,250 to £245,396.
A sobering note, however, is contained in the chairman’s
annual report. There, Sir Douglas Forbes says that the com-
pany’s 1964 crushing was not encouraging. A much reduced
crop in Bundaberg was anticipated and the company expected
to treat a maximum 500,000 tons at its two mills.
Sir Douglas says the company does not see any need to
seek further capital from shareholders for the next two years.
During this period it will have to pay out nearly £700,000
to expand its two crushing mills, enabling them to process the
substantial increase in production allotted.
Contracts for £469,027 of new plant, machinery and equip-
ment have been entered into for this expansion. A further
expenditure of £220,000 is envisaged. This is in addition to
other company spending, including £250,000 for the addi-
tion of four storeys and remodelling of Millaquin House in
Bundaberg for tenancy purposes.

Interesting Rights Trading
Allied Mills for a sound long term
ITTIhe recent announcement by Allied
Mills Ltd of yet another one-for-
four par issue seems to have been fully
anticipated by the market, although the
last one was made over four years ago.
In 1959, Allied Mills must have set a
near record for issues when it made three
(all on the basis of one-for-four) in the
same calendar year.
Prior to this, Allied Mills had made no
issues to shareholders since it was formed
in October, 1949, to amalgamate the
interests of Thorpes, Mungo Scott and
Keys & Co. Certainly the dividend rate
of 5 p.c. was lifted to 6 p.c. in 1957
and to 10 p.c. in 1958, but the 1959
year was the real bonanza. The 10 p.c.
rate was maintained after the issues of
1959 and 1960 and was again increased
to 3 2 p.c. in 1962. Today the shares are
showing a yield of 2.6 p.c. from the
12 p.c. dividend. This will become 3 p.c.
after the new issue, assuming that the
12 p.c. rate will be maintained. This
seems most likely, because even the in-
creased ordinary dividend commitment
of £300,000 will be covered not less than
1.7 times by the 1962-63 profit.
Nevertheless, this seems a fairly low
yield in the case of a company whose
shares sold consistently below their par
value prior to 1958. In fact, this yield
puts the stock in the top 10 p.c. of the
share list, yielding 3 p.c. or less, along
with the blue chips like AWA, ACI,
Boral, BHP, Burns Philp, Henry Jones,
ICIANZ, Mauri Bros & Thompson, Rep-
co, Union Carbide and W. R. Carpenter.
One must admit that the “under 3 p.c.
yield” list also includes a number of
“newcomers” such as Big Sister, Borg-
Warner, Captain Products, Colbro,
Country TV, Ensign, F. H. Stephens,
Grace Bros, Kolotex, Lindeman and
Wattyl. The term “newcomer” is not
intended to mean that the company is
a recent formation, merely that the shares
have recently become popular.
reasons for such popularity can be
A many and varied, though generally a
rapidly rising per share earnings seems
to be the mainspring of this popularity.
Other factors are frequently industry
glamor at the time sugar stocks be-
came popular about nine to twelve
months ago and a restricted market
in the shares. We might then examine
these factors in the reverse order.
Allied Mills’ shares are neither readily
available nor tightly held. Weekly dis-
closed turnover varies. In recent weeks it
could have averaged around 5000 shares
and at the time of writing the last day’s
turnover was 1700. Certainly 32 p.c. of
the present paid capital was issued to the
former shareholders of John Darling &
Son (Australia) Ltd when that company
was acquired in early 1962. It is doubt-
ful whether this has restricted the market
in any way. In fact, there should have
been an increasing market since, in terms
of the original takeover offer, the Darl-
ing family and Spillers Ltd agreed to re-
duce their holdings to not more than ten
p.c. of the Allied Mills capital before
early 1965. This suggests that some
800,000 shares need to have been sold
out of these two holdings and one would
have expected a depressive effect as a
result.
/"|ne could hardly say that the flour-
milling industry is a glamorous one.
So far as it is possible to judge, domestic
per capita consumption of flour has been
declining over a long period and there
seems to be excess milling capacity. Up
to 1962 exports had also fallen, but since
then there has been some “windfall” ex-
ports which could be regarded as having
reversed the trend. Ftowever, the export
position does not present a very opti-
mistic picture. The stock feed situation
may be rather more attractive, particu-
larly with the increased emphasis on cat-
tle production in recent years. The most
glamorous industry in which Allied Mills
is engaged, however, would be the marga-
rine and cooking oils industry. Many stu-
dents of company activities have conclu-
ded that this side of Allied Mills activities
is the major profit earner. From this
angle, Allied Mills seems to be priced
roughly on a par with Gillespie Bros
(which holds a third interest in the marga-
rine/cooking oils group) so far as the
dividend yield is concerned, but it would
appear that Allied Mills’ earnings for
1963-64 will need to show an increase
of about 15 p.c. to bring the earnings
yields into line. Marrickville Holdings, on
the other hand, is priced to show a higher
dividend yield but a lower earnings yield.
From the point of view of earnings
growth, Allied Mills has quite a good
record over the last four years, as during
this period an annual compound rate of
increase of about 8 p.c. has been
achieved. The factor which has influ-
enced the market rather more than this
growth rate is the high dividend cover
of 2.1 times. This suggests to many in-
vestors that there is scope for capital
benefits. The new rights issue with its
substantial bonus content has gone a
long way to justifying their confidence.
The company’s capacity to earn profits
is clearly demonstrated by the fact that,
over a much longer period, the annual
rate of increase in earnings per share
has been about 18 p.c. It must, however,
be stated that the period when earnings
were increasing at the greatest rate was
from 1955 to 1958 inclusive. For much
of this period the shares were selling to
show a dividend yield of close to 7 p.c.
and an earnings yield varying up to
33 p.c.!
rpo sum up, then, Allied Mills has a
good earnings record which is tend-
ing to level off. Of the industries in which
it is engaged only the margarine and
cooking oil industry has any glamor so
far as the market is concerned, yet one
would guess that there are benefits to
be gained by the association with pre-
pared flours and various cake mixes.
Pending the reduction of the holdings of
the Darling family and Spillers Limited,
one could expect that there might be a
ceiling on the price but whether this re-
duction has been made is difficult to
determine. During the latter half of
1962, the share price varied between 14s.
and 16s. 6d. It has increased fairly stead-
ily since, reaching the 235. mark early
this year.
It is difficult to see any short-term
price improvement and the rights trading
will be interesting. As a long-term invest-
ment, the shares seem sound even at
current prices.

BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS
Rather Elusive on Issues
Is Mar fleet and Weight ready?
has rarely been a company
A which appeared so “bonus-prone”
as does Marfleet and Weight at present.
And, failing this, there have been even
fewer which looked so ready to. make
a cash issue of shares. At March 31 last,
this Melbourne - based manufacturing
engineer and importer of industrial
equipment held reserves in the balance
sheet at £387,000 —far in excess of the
£278,000 paid capital.
Add to this pointer the rising trend in
earning rates, the twice-covered dividend
and the fact that shareholders’ issues
have been rare since public listing in
1954, and one can't help conclude that
a bonus issue may well be in the wind
for the first time.
The chances of a cash issue in the
near future are even higher. In Mar-
fleet's listed history there has been only
one —a meagre one-for-nine in 1961-62,
which left little for shareholders in the
way of capital gains as each new 10s.
unit was subject to a 10s. premium
charge. It was made to give the com-
pany's working capital a shot in the arm.
As working capital has decreased
every year since 1961, and is now at a
very low ebb, the argument for making
another cash issue seems stronger than
ever. It is enhanced by the same factors
which would enable a bonus issue—high
earning rate, well-covered dividend, etc.
But all this surmise and discussion is
probably only idle chatter. The fact
of the matter is that, on past record,
Marfleet is simply not one of those
companies which thinks very much of
shareholders’ issues. Not unless it needs
the cash, of course, as in 1961-62. Even
then the money was raised on the most
miserly terms. The directors’ main
thoughts appear to be solely along the
lines of maintaining the old-established
124 p.c. dividend and building up
reserves.
Although the shareholders’ chances are
highest for a cash issue, it now seems
unlikely that this will occur in the near
future. At the annual meeting on
August 26, no mention or hint was made
of such moves. In fact, not even a
comment on the current year's trading
was passed. It seems that another steady
year of growth is at hand, and another
124 p.c. dividend.
The group operates through six sub-
sidiaries, all incorporated in Victoria —
Marweight Equipment, A. Challings-
worth, Abbey Engineering, G.B.
Material Handling, Gibson Battle
(Melb.), and Telson Construction Com-
pany. Under licence from overseas, the
parent company, Marfleet Weight, manu-
factures equipment for forging, mining,
screening, newspaper and materials hand-
ling. It also makes, under licence, exca-
vators and dredges, rotary filters, pulp
and paper machinery, cement-making
plants, valves and handling systems. The
machine shop operates 24 hours a day
for most of the week.
Challingsworth is a fabrication specia-
list with experience dating back to
1880. Most of its work is in girders, gas
holders, chimney stacks, crane structures,
silos, tanks, steelwork for building, plate
work, heavy machine frames and stain-
less steel fabrication. Abbey Engineering
manufactures hydraulic work platforms
and cranes, as well as components for
other group companies and firms outside
the group.
other important member, and
possibly the most important, is Mar-
weight Equipment. This is the selling
company for the whole group. It also
undertakes the design and manufacture
of large projects, particularly in the
materials-handling field. As well as sell-
ing most of the group's products, it also
has exclusive agencies from companies
in UK, USA, Germany, Sweden, Italy
and Spain. Branch offices have been
opened in all States except Tasmania,
where an agency is in operation.
This selling subsidiary came into being
in 1960-61, after a takeover was made
which has since proved to be the main
highlight in the company's history. Its
financial effect is reflected in the figures
of the table which will be discussed later.
Gibson Battle (Melb.), a well-known
sales and design company, was acquired
in a move which was entirely responsible
for the 1961 capital increase from
£160,000 to £244,423.
Main reason for the purchase was to
provide a ready-made sales organisation,
capable of handling all sales by the
group. Gibson's name was changed to
Marweight Equipment, but the original
name was retained for use in other parts
of the group’s operations. Probably the
most significant factor arising from the
move was the creation of certain tax-free
reserves. These were large enough to
pay the 1 21 p.c. dividends in 1961 and
1962, and still leave a few pounds over.

Profits were not touched at all during
those years and went entirely to reserves.
This explains the huge reserve in-
creases in those two years, as shown
in the table. Before then, and from
now on, reserve growth will go along
steadier lines. As previously mentioned,
so will the group’s all-over growth.
Steady expansion has now made it
necessary to build a new fitting shop.
It will be at Abbotsford and tenders
should soon be let.
M and W tends to expand more in line
with general Australian industrial growth
than a lot of similar companies, mainly
because much of its contracting is done
with Government departments and large
industrial concerns. For example, a coal-
winning dredger was recently handed
over to the SEC of Victoria. Again,
five sets of turbines have been ordered
for power stations by the Snowy Moun-
tains Hydro-Electric Authority.
The table shows a fairly healthy
and consistent financial record. The
1961 year is the highlight and created
what upheavals there are to be seen.
Earning rates took a bit of a knock
because of the paid capital increase, but
they’ve always been healthy and could
well show a complete return to the 1960
level of 30.9 p.c. in the current year.
These healthy earning rates have
always provided a good cover for the
well-established dividend rate, and left
a sizeable surplus for the reserves each
year. As a result, reserves have grown
steadily, and the boosts in 1961 and 1962
have lifted them well clear of the paid
capital.
Fixed assets have seen mainly steady
growth, except for the big jump they
scored in the vital takeover year.
Gradual depreciation increases reflect this
growth. The writing-off of all intan-
gibles this year possibly gives the balance
sheet a truer ring than it had previously.
Working capital is satisfactory, but it
could be better. Loan capital also pro-
vides little worry, although a slight
lowering would not go amiss.
The share price has been relatively
steady over the years. The high dividend
yield reflects the general investment
opinion that the company is not much
good for issues or capital gains, but an
excellent income stock.
It is rather hard to accurately sum up
the value of the 10s. shares in the light
of recent market prices. They cost
around 295. and yield a little more than
4 p.c. Generally, at this price, they
offer little more, in the short term, than
a steady dividend income—with the pos-
sibility of an increase in the current
year if earnings continue upwards, as
they should. In the long run, the market
price will probably rise to well over 305.,
as long as the company’s expansion con-
tinues.
Overhanging all this is the possibility
of another share issue. Financially,
everything points to this. The time is
ripe, yet counterbalancing this situation
is the ungenerous issue policy of the
past years. The one-and-only left hardly
a bean in capital gains for shareholders.
It is one of those unpredictable situa-
tions where you kick yourself for not
buying if an issue is announced or, if
it isn’t, you’ve bought them anyway, so
you still end up kicking yourself. Buy-
ing would be little more than a stab in
the dark if capital gains are the fore-
most of your motives. In the long term,
of course, the chances for such gains
are good, and a healthy income may
accrue in the meantime.
MEGGITT LTD
Lower Margins on Sales
support given about 18 months
ago has placed the Australian lin-
seed industry on a strong footing, though
the profitability of the main processor of
the vegetable oil seed crop, Meggitt Ltd,
has been affected by importations of
safflower and soybean oils.
These have been available overseas at
depressed prices and have been used as
a substitute for linseed oil in some indus-
trial processes, particularly in the paint
industry.
Meggitt is by far the largest Australian
processor in the field, supplying a wide
range of industry with oils, meals and
chemicals. Last year it was able to lift
sales by 3.7 p.c. Profit, however, was
affected by lower margins on sales to the
surface coating industry.
The company was formed in 1911 and
was reconstructed in 1920 prior to Stock
Exchange listing.
Results during the 1920 s varied. From
1929 on, the company has not failed to
earn a profit and pay a dividend —
although reserves were drawn on in
1931 and 1932 to pay the 11 p.c. and
2\ p.c. dividends.
Since 1929, it has worked in associa-
tion with Blundell, Spence and Co. Ltd,
of London, in the manufacture of lin-
seed oil in this country. Large quanti-
ties of the oil are used in the manufac-
ture of linoleum and paint. The meal,
a by-product of the process, is used in
the manufacture of stock feeds.
The company’s principal mill is at
Parramatta. Other plants are located
in Melbourne, Port Adelaide and Bris-
bane.
Until 1948, the company relied on
imports for its supply of linseed. About
15 years ago, pilot crops of linseed were
grown in Australia. They proved suc-
cessful and several years later soybean
and safflower crops were planted.
The industry received active assistance
from the Federal Government, but was
hampered by imports. As the result of
a Tariff Board inquiry, new rates of
duty were imposed on the importation
of these three vegetable oils in February,
1963. The assistance proved adequate
for linseed. The growing of safflower
seed and soybean has not yet reached
self-sufficiency levels. Further represen-
tations have been made to the Tariff
Board, which the industry hopes will re-
sult in more protection.
As a result of the company's active
assistance to growers of the various
seeds, the transportation of the seed in
bulk from the farms to the mills has
increased, requiring the investment in
more bulk storage at Forbes, another
at Wee Waa, adjacent to the cotton gin,
and the Brunton mill at Clyde with its
railsiding facilities was purchased.
These moves have caused a drain on
working capital. Additional funds have
been provided by the sale of most of
the company’s holding of Commonwealth
bonds —£190,000 worth at slightly above
face value. In addition, certain property

at Wingfield, in South Australia, and
Parramatta has been sold at a capital
profit.
Reflecting the additional facilities,
book value of fixed assets (land and
buildings) rose in the latest year from
£444,267 to £545,978, while plant and
equipment rose from £281,370 to
£304,213. The increased size of the
vegetable oilseeds crop shows up in the
greater value of stock on hand —
£290,588 higher at £1,542,195. This
is a net figure after deducting £127,000
for possible diminution in the value of
the stock.
Following the sale of the bonds the
company appears to have no liquidity
problems, although overdraft is up from
£264,780 to £397,984.
Profit from trading in the latest year
to May 31, before tax, was actually up
slightly. The net figure was affected
by greater tax provision, £lO,OOO higher
at £62,000 and a reduced interest from
bonds.
Result for the year came out at
£74,648, equal to 14 p.c. on capital.
Nevertheless, dividend on the ordinary
capital of £504,743 has been held at
124 p.c. for the fifth successive year.
The payout on the £40,000 in preference
capital takes £4OOO.
Capital changes have been few, the
only issue to shareholders being a one-
for-three bonus in 1959 and the split
of the 20s. shares into ss. units.
Assets backing of each ss. share,
based on book values, is 14s. sd. The
company has no intangible items in its
books. However, there is a hidden re-
serve in the investments, which appear
in the books at £23,121 but had a mar-
ket value at balance date of £106,933,
representing an additional backing for
each ordinary share of 94d.
The shares are currently selling at
13s. to show a dividend yield of about
4.8 p.c. At this level they appear
underpriced for a long term investment.

SPECULATOR’S DIARY
Disappointing Market, But Not Baffling
Some ventures into low-priced shares
results keep pouring out, yet all
the market does is stay weak. It’s
really the old story of stockmarket
anticipation. So while it’s disappointing,
it should not be regarded as baffling.
In fact, looking ahead of the results, the
current year could prove a difficult one
for a number of companies. Increased
costs will affect profits of any company
that can’t pass on the costs. Those that
can will be starting the inevitable spiral
of inflation.
At the same time, we’re having an-
other symptom of a boom rising
imports. Imports averaged just under
£lOO million per month for the 1963-64
period, July was up to a record figure of
£ll6 million pounds and this was quickly
broken by the August figure of £ll9
million.
Turning back to company results, the
ones that should be criticised most are
those which gave misleading interim
reports. In my own portfolio, Conkey’s
profit was very much less than what the
interim report led one to believe. At
least the company was able to increase
its profits fractionally, though.
Not so with Automotive Components
—profits fell so heavily that they only
just covered the reduced 7 p.c. dividend.
This performance was in direct con-
trast to my first purchase of the week —
Viscount Holdings. Not to be confused
with the cigarette, it is a small but
energetic company operating in Albury.
Fortunately the energy has been directed
in the right direction. Profits jumped 60
p.c. in the last year and a very respect-
able earning rate of 19.2 p.c. was
notched.
Why, then, does the share sell at Bs.?
As good as any reason is its stock ex-
change listed activity of “motel supplies”.
In fact, the motel side of the business
is relatively small. Following the take-
over of D. J. Delarue Pty Ltd in 1963,
engineering is the dominant activity. A
variety of the products, including grain-
handling equipment, bins and super-
phosphate elevators, are used in primary
industry. Other engineering products are
used in public works, with the Snowy
Mountains Authority being an important
consumer. Viscount Holdings seems to
have little difficulty competing against
the big city merchants. A fair example
of the confidence of the management is
a decision to increase the capacity of
the factory by 50 p.c. by the end of the
year. All this points to higher profits
this year. My order for 1000 shares was
executed at Bs.
Another low-priced share that war-
rants attention is Plastic Holdings.
Listed at the end of 1960, it got the
backlash of the sudden recession. The
best it could do in the first year of
operations was to show a £6OOO loss.
From this point on, things have im-
proved steadily. The earning rate was
12.2 p.c. in 1962, rose to 15.7 p.c. in
1963 and was topped again in 1964 with
a figure of 17.9 p.c. Quite justly,
directors at the annual meeting last
October seemed well pleased with their
progress. This year they must be doing
handsprings!
Heavy turnover in the shares has kept
the price down around the 7s. mark.
My purchase of 1000 shares added to
that turnover.
It was one of those weeks when I was
doing things in threes. Thus I added
1000 Commercial Guaranty shares at 4s.
to the portfolio, on the expectation that
it will have a better maiden year on the
exchange than did Plastic Holdings. To
advance from the negative to the positive,
it is also on the expectation that the
company will be making its first dividend
payment.
A successful factoring company, firstly,
must be able to borrow funds cheaply,
and, secondly, carefully select and super-
vise its business. This Commercial
Guaranty has been able to do with its
institutional backing and sound manage-
ment.
The week’s sales were a case of taking
a few more profits. First of all Draffin
Everhot had risen nicely to 295. and
gave me a profit of £39. The other
sale was half my Tableland Tin holding
at 495. and here the profit was £166.
Transactions for the week were:
SOLD
500 Tableland Tin, 49/- £l2lO
300 Draffin Everhot, 29/- £428
BOUGHT
1000 Viscount Holdings, 8/- ... £412
1000 Plastic Holdings, 6/9 £349
1000 Commercial Guaranty, 4/- £209
There’s still plenty of cash in the till
—£1297 to be exact.

THE MAN
ON THE LAND
Improving the Show Business
A new president at Victorian HAS
Presidents of show societies, like
bishops and judges, usually stay in
office for a long period. It is therefore
of more than passing interest that the
Royal Agricultural Society of Victoria
has a new president this year.
He is Mr G. P. H. Wilson, of Ber-
wick, Victoria, and his first show, as
president, starts on September 17. He is
hardly unfamiliar with the Royal Mel-
bourne Showgrounds, however.
His father and grandfather were
councillors and he has been a councillor
himself since the war. He has exhibited
Shropshire and Dorset Horn sheep and
Kelpie sheepdogs. He is also a winner of
the pasture improvement and farm man-
agement class conducted by the RAS
as a valuable extension to the activities
within the showground itself.
Of greater importance, possibly, is the
fact that Mr Wilson was awarded, in
1952, a Nuffield Scholarship which per-
mitted him to study farming at first hand
in the United Kingdom for a year.
He is, first and foremost, a practical
farmer and an intensive farmer. On his
third generation Berwick property, site,
incidentally, of some of the filming of
“On the Beach - ’ a few years ago, he
maintains two separate dairy herds, a
Poll Hereford commercial beef herd,
and a stud Dorset Horn sheep flock.
The 550-acre property is entirely sown
with improved pastures, resulting in a
farm production possibly three to four
times greater than would be possible
under normal conditions.
Mr Wilson is 46. This means that a
younger man is now guiding the destinies
of the Victorian RAS. As a compara-
tively young man, and an intensive far-
mer, he has some ideas which are likely
to result in some changes not radical
perhaps in the format of the show. He
is very much aware that the commercial
farmer has, of recent years, become in-
creasingly critical of shows and what they
are supposed to do for him.
A number of commercial farmers have,
m fact, turned their backs completely on
shows in general. Moreover, a strong
segment of agricultural academics, some
°f them in responsible posts in the De-
partment of Agriculture, CSIRO and the
universities, have been rather caustic in
their criticism of show standards.
As pointed out in these columns pre-
viously, some of this criticism is mis-
placed in that theories about breeding
animals, on paper, can always be far
more definite than they are in practice.
To the consternation of the academics,
the evolution of truly remarkable animals
sometimes defies rational explanation;
just as the most unlikely mating of the
human male and female sometimes pro-
duces a genius.
It is also an unpalatable fact, to the
academic mind, that some of the so-
called new theories were well understood
at the time of Robert Bakewell and are
simply roses by another name.
However, where there's smoke there’s
fire. Mr Wilson believes some additions
to show schedules are long overdue.
Additions is the operative word.
What the show has is good, he be-
lieves. The stud breeder knows his busi-
ness. As a good proportion of that busi-
ness is in the selling of animals to other
studs, he is entitled to have a big say in
how the show, the shop window for stud
stock, is conducted.
But Mr Wilson would like to see some
of the commercial classes for sheep and
cattle (and also pigs, possibly) which are
a feature of some British shows intro-
duced here. In these classes it is possible
for the commercial farmer to get a far
more comprehensive picture of a breed’s
potentiality in commercial operations as
distinct from stud operations.
For example, a Dorset ram will be
represented by offspring from, perhaps,
five ewes of different breeds. One of those

breeds may be Suffolk, for example, and
if the commercial man is interested in
Dorset-Suffolk crosses then he has some-
thing in front of him which he can
evaluate. At present, if he is interested
in crossing or grading up, he has to go
largely by trial and error methods.
This kind of show class has all kinds
of subtleties which would be appreciated
by the commercial farmer. He may be a
dairy farmer and he may want to cross
some of his dairy cows with a beef breed.
Now it is possible that one particular
line of Hereford, or Shorthorn, may get
better results when put over dairy cows
than another line of Hereford, or Short-
horn.
Apart from these possible additions
to the schedules, the Victorian RAS is al-
ready moving in new directions aimed at
helping the commercial farmer. Some of
the academics are still not satisfied but
few could deny that at least a start has
been made.
Lot-feeding has been tested pretty thor-
oughly for three years now and statistics
compiled on food conversion ratios have
shown that, at present anyway, it is
cheaper in this country to raise beef on
grass. This year, lot-feeding has been ex-
panded to a form of progeny testing. A
beef symposium was held at the show-
grounds a week ago in which farmers
who attended were able to hear the views
of stud men, scientists, processors, but-
chers, and, most important, housewives.
The general conclusion: the beef in-
dustry is in good shape provided costs
can be kept down. Whatever happens to
overseas markets, the fact remains that
home consumers would buy more meat
if they could afford it; and if they had
more confidence that they were getting
value for money.
T ivestock is only a part of the Aus-
** tralian show, of course, and this is
where it is difficult sometimes to make
comparisons with overseas shows. Be-
cause of our population distribution it
is impossible to make any large show
pay unless the fun of the fair is provided
for largely non - farming - minded city
people.
Merry-go-rounds and sideshows are not
enough, either. Support must be obtained
from firms manufacturing machinery and
household goods.
Whether it is machinery for the far-
mer or furniture for the office worker,
the shows have been taking a bit of
a hiding in recent years. Field days in
country centres and exhibitions (the Boat
Show, the Motor Show, the Homes Show,
etc.) in the cities have helped create the
idea that the show is old hat. Mr Wilson
has some ideas on this which should pay
dividends.
For farm machinery, Melbourne Show
is still the biggest and the best in Austra-
lia— and just possibly the world. True,
the farmer cannot see the plough actually
ripping up the ground, but he can get a
comparison of price and model which is
unique. He can soon arrange to have the
implement that takes his eye demon-
strated on his own property. This, Mr
Wilson claims, is better even than seeing
it operating on someone else’s property at
a field day.
In other types of exhibitions Mr Wil-
son may push for some of the ideas he
gleaned at the New York World’s Fair
a month back. The general public will
come to exhibitions if the surroundings
are made attractive enough, he believes.
The use of water fountains, compara-
tively cheap innovations, was a big thing
in New York’s fairgrounds. Educational
displays might also be stepped up here,
following the American pattern.
/\ne new thing at Melbourne this year
— admittedly borrowed from Bris-
bane and Sydney Royals is the Meat
Hall, in which housewives can learn the
things about preparing and cooking
meat which mother did not tell them.
Mr Wilson appears to be not only a
progressive show president, but also a
brave one. The big ring attraction this
year is the rodeo complete with Brah-
man bulls, from Queensland, which are
said to love bucking.
In Sydney a show rodeo may not be
a big talking point. In Melbourne it is
dynamite. Already letters have appeared
in most of the papers condemning the
rodeo as “barbaric”, etc.
Much will depend on how the rodeo
is conducted. On this score Mr Wilson
believes he and the show have little to
fear. The Brahman bulls, and the horses,
are all tried and proven rodeo performers
who know their business as well as the
harness horse knows his. They are well
cared for and very well fed. Most of
them, anyway, would have long ago been
converted into dogs’ meat or sausages
were they not trained rodeo performers.
Last week the Victorian RSPCA met
to discuss this show rodeo and other
things, but ended in disorder with re-
signations, recriminations and general
chaos. One observer, not very originally
perhaps, described it as a “proper dog
and cat fight”.
Nevertheless, it has been announced
publicly that special police will be on
duty at the show to inspect rodeo animals
for evidence of cruelty. The show orga-
nisers are confident no such evidence will
be forthcoming. They put a' lot of
thought into this rodeo business before
going ahead and believe they have taken
every possible precaution against mishap.
Tust the same, it would only need one
** horse with a broken leg for an
avalanche of criticism to descend on the
show and its new president. Victorians,
and their Chief Secretary, Arthur Rylah,
get steamed up very easily over allega-
tions of cruelty.
Pleased with all the fuss and bother are
the hardbitten, rodeo-rider types. Said
one: “We never got advance publicity
like this nowhere before.”
The rodeo could be a show winner,
despite criticism from one section of the
public. Melbourne youngsters may be
keen to see the real thing following the
top-rating Stoney Burke series on TV
in this city. Stoney, TV-wise, is hot pro-
perty. Some will deplore the “American-
isation” of rodeo, though it seems to be
what the younger generation wants these
days.
Elsewhere in the ring the showjumpers,
always popular in Melbourne, will face
the setback of having the Olympic team
absent this year (horses and riders are
in strict training at Bowral, NSW, with
the Tokyo trip imminent). Other young
exponents of the art are sure to material-
ise to put on a pretty good exhibition.
An unusual ring attraction this year
will be the tree-climbing contest. Kelly
Stanley, billed as the world’s champion
tree climber, has been brought out from
America to take on all-comers. Stanley
scoots up and down an 80ft tree trunk,
embedded in the arena, using clamps and
spurs on his legs and a rope over his
shoulders.
This contest is a show-ring adaptation
of the method by which loggers cut off
the tops of the big trees before felling
them in the North American pine forests.
There’s no certainty yet that, at Mel-
bourne Show, it will be a contest.
So far, only one challenger to Stanley
has come forward a fellow named
Jack Swain from Noojee, in Gippsland,
where he does something of the same
sort of work in the big forests there.
Swain is not sure he can match Stanley
because tree-climbing at speed is a pro-
fession in the US, while it is just a job
here. But already Swain’s mates are call-
ing him “Koala Jack”. In the best Austra-
lian tradition he is prepared to “have a
go”.


Bread for a Hungry India
An Australian advising under Colombo Plan
Tndia is hungry again. Conservatively,
at least half of her 470 million
people rise hungry every morning and
go to bed hungry every night. There is
not enough food to go around, in spite
of massive shipments of Public Law 480
wheat from the United States. What
food there is has been priced out of the
reach of millions of India’s poor.
Crops have failed in some areas.
Hoarding of foodgrains in anticipation
of still higher prices has aggravated the
situation. There have been food riots,
protests and demonstrations in almost
every State.
The experts say that millions of
Indians may have to go hungry for years
yet, as foodgrain production falls fur-
ther and further behind the demands of
an exploding population.
It is against this background of
urgency that Eric Bond, director of the
Australian Bread Research Institute,
Sydney, has been called in under the
Colombo Plan to advise the Indian
Government on ways of increasing and
improving bread production.
At present, bread production and con-
sumption is small in India. Bread is
eaten largely only in the big cities (75
p.c. of the population lives in villages)
and mostly by Westernised Indians.
In southern India, rice is the staple
grain and bread production is very small.
In the north, wheat replaces rice, but it
is eaten mostly in the form of flat,
round, unleavened chappatis.
During his survey of Indian baking,
milling and yeast-manufacturing indus-
tries, Mr Bond has made the point that
wheat can contribute more protein to
the diet than most cereals, that it is the
most readily available cereal throughout
the world, and that there is great scope
for increased production of wheat. But
focusing on India's own grave food
problem he has especially emphasised
that bread lends itself readily to large-
scale mass-production.
Onlike chappatis, which must be
eaten fresh and must therefore be pre-
pared slowly and laboriously in the home
before each meal, bread can be turned
out by the thousands of loaves from
modern bakeries.
Today, as Mr Bond has found, India
has only a handful of large, reasonably
modern bakeries. Most Indian bread
is produced in tiny mud-hut bakeries
with appalling standards of hygiene and
shocking working conditions.
Many a time he has entered a tiny
bakery and watched workers shoo a
black mass of flies off dough waiting to
be baked. In cities such as Lucknow
he has seen six men working in a bakery
10ft by 10ft.
Most Indian bread is made from
American or Australian wheat. The
Government does not permit Indian
wheat to be milled into flour. It is sold
only as grain and is coarse-ground by
women at home
Mr Bond ha" discovered that India
has a long way to go before it can
possess a sizeable modern baking Indus-
try. At present, for example, all the
bakers in Calcutta-a city of nearly
6 million-produce less bread than one
large Australian faetory.
. , .
. Australia has eight yeast plants cater-
ing for the bread industry s needs.
India imported its yeast until 1961. To-
day it has one small yeast factory in
Calcutta, with an output one-third that
of an Australian yeast plant.
Most of India s bread is thus made
with toddy—fermented juice from palm
trees instead of yeast. The bread is
often rather sour and during the mon-
soon, in particular, quality is shockingly
ow -
India will also need improved milling
capacity if it wishes to increase bread
production. Mr Bond has found that
most Indian flourmills have not had any
money spent on them for five years.
The Indian baking industry has little
mechanical equipment. Mr Bond be-
lieves, however, that, if suitable financing
can be arranged, small-scale baking
equipment can be imported suitable to
the industry’s needs. In the near future,
he says, all this machinery could be
manufactured in India.
Can Indians be persuaded to eat more
bread?
Mr Bond points to Japan, where the
Government actively sponsored a switch
from more expensive rice to bread. As
part of its education programme it gave
school-children free sandwich lunches.
In India he sees no insuperable pro-
blem in a switch from rice to bread,
though he thinks the change from chap-
patis to bread may be more difficult—
especially as chappatis are more suited to
the Indian way of eating curries with
the fingers. However, he thinks that, as
living conditions improve, women will
rebel more and more against slaving
over a smoky fire making chappatis.
He believes bread should be cheaper
in India—it now costs about the same as
in Australia—and that it should be better
displayed by bakers. Bread is usually
hidden away under the counter and a
consumer ofter has to hunt from shop
to shop to find any.
Mr Bond sees one other great virtue
for bread in India. It can be used as
a “carrier” for nutrients to improve
Indian nutrition. In particular, it could
include the “multi-purpose food”—
basically peanut flour—which the Indian
Government is now trying to popularise
as a way of righting India’s serious pro-
tein deficiency.
In other words it could truly become
a “staff of life” for India’s 470 million
people.
Substitutes for Jute Woolpacks
Indian industry facing many troubles
Tn pointing the bone at others, particu-
larly the Americans and their
double standard on meat imports, we
sometimes overlook the fact that we
leave ourselves open to charges of
duplicity. Perhaps, in trade, every
nation seeks to have its cake and eat
it too.
At this very moment millions are
starving in India. There are moves to
have wheat ships diverted to ease the
famine, although how much good a
couple of ships are going to do is doubt-
ful. There is the commendable Wheat
for India campaign which has urged,
for some months now, that the Austra-
lian Government give one million tons of
wheat, worth about £25 million, to India
every year. This quantity might be
really worthwhile.
There are well meaning, and highly
complex, plans to enable credit to be
granted to India so she can purchase
more Australian wheat and more Austra-
lian wool.
And while all this is going on we are
setting about cutting off the one im-
portant commodity we do happen to buy
from India—jute.
We use jute for woolpacks. Every
year we need about five million of them,
worth £4 million. Most of the jute
comes from India, a proportion from
Pakistan.
The wool industry, or rather some
sections of the industry, are increasingly
apprehensive over our dependence on
this jute. Both the Wool Board and
textile manufacturers have criticised the
quality of jute woolpacks and the
damage which jute contamination causes
to the wool.
Jute fibres do become mixed with the
wool. This means heavy costs are in-
curred in eliminating the jute at various
stages of manufacture. Man-made
fibres, on the other hand, are delivered
to the textile mills in an altogether clean
state. It is claimed, with justification,
that the man-made fibres can be guaran

teed 100 p.c. clean and true to type,
and that this weighs heavily with the

A number of alternative packs for
wool are being looked into here by the
CSIRO and private firms. Gne sugges-
tion is that wool could be packed in
plastics which, if anything comes of it,
would mean that the “marriage” of wool
and synthetics would have been
achieved, on a de facto basis perhaps.
Price is not so much in favor of jute
as it used to be. A few weeks ago
jute, stable for a long time, went up
nearly £5O a ton. The full impact on
woolpack prices will not be realised pro-
bably until later this year.
The cause of the jute rise is said to be
flooding in East Pakistan, resulting in
a severe shortage of the jute available
for shipping. As it is a matter of supply,
rather than over-enthusiastic demand,
the position may correct itself.
Yet the Indian jute industry still faces
many troubles. Perhaps we ought not to
expect either India or Pakistan to con-
tinue producing jute at the sweated-labor
prices we have got used to. Pakistan
actually has cut into the Indian supply
to Australia and, in 1962-63, Indian
exports to Australia fell from 60,000
tons to 35,000 tons.
The industry is pressing the Indian
Government for concessions so that it
can meet the competition from Pakistan
which, due to subsidies, can undersell
Indian suppliers by about £4O a ton.
There seems no problem in finding
markets for jute. Despite the internal
difficulties, and the competition from
Pakistan, production both for export and
home consumption is up fractionally this
year.
If Australia finds a substitute for
woolpacks, however, we might expect to
hear some nasty things said about us.
Would they be all that unjustified?
