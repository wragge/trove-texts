Australasian Verse
They still go on doing it. Four more
Australian bards, all minor, but each with
his or her little facet quietly reflecting
beauty. Here is A. Gore-Jones, with Troops,
Trains and O.V. (Hassell, Adelaide), whose
' work is well known by Bulletin readers.
She has the technique, but her lire is merely
a lambent glowq pleasant to warm one’s soul
with, but without a leaping flame. She does
her best work in the sonnet, and reprints sev-
eral fina “sonnets of the months” that have
appeared on this page. She touches lightly
upon the war, evoking a gentle feminine
pathos; but her Anzac sonnet, though good,
is not worthy of that splendid failure. She
has some pretty place-poems, and she sings
with greater fervor of Queensland, where
winter comes
with gentle feet,
And all her smiles are sunny, her airs are
soft and sweet.
The plains spread green about her, the
wattles break in gold,
Short days of brilliant sunlight, long nights
of splendid-cold-
Her Brisbane sonnet, though not her best,
deserves quotation, for Brisbane’s sake: —
A red. cathedral's tiles, a tapering spire
Piercing her gaunt zinc roofs, the city lies.
Dim blue hills rise about her circle-wise,
And flame-trees deck her steep white streets
with fire.
While trepiulous as some Motion choir
Beside tier riverway the bamboo sighsj
And to a burning sweep of turquoise skies
Ascends that slow sad song of lost desire.
' Stranger than all her sisters of the South,
With languid warmth she lifts her sun-
browned arms
In eager longing towards the distant sea:
This Northern witch with young and glowing
mouth,
And half-alluring, half-elusive charms,
That bear the tropic's seal of mystery.
And there is for A. Gore-Jones an unaccus-
tomed vigor and joy in this doggy-verse that
makes it for this page worth a century of
nice, neat, numb sonnets: —
FELICITY.
I would like to be a dog on a windy day,
When the sky is swept with great sails of
grey.
To splash through puddles of iris blue,
And folloic where fancy icould lead one to.
Out of the light and into the shadow,
Over the hillock and under the willow.
To leap at the flying rays of the sun,
Just leap, bark and leap, would be jolly good
fun.
Pursuing a icing down some hidden drive,
Lusty with living and being alive.
Yet dogs must grow old, and staid, and wise,
And assume the burden of family ties;
Bleary of eye and stiff with pain,
When the sparkle of youth will not come
again.
But oh! the joy while the paws are fleet,
Four white paws and a sound heart beat.
Four white paws and a whistling wind,
And no hand to stay and fetter to bind.
Just to leap and race, and bound and spring,
And never give a damn for any old thing.
Boyce Bowden reprints The Wellington
Verses (Whitcombe and Tombs, M.L.) that
he had contributed to this paper. Welling-
ton should be proud of this tribute to her
gusty beauty, though Australia qualifies its
praise. Boyce Bowden suffers from a fatal
facility ; it is so easy for him to pour forth
cascades of bubbling phrases, torrents of
tumultuous words. In the gay lilt of his
metre what need to worry over rimes like
caution-portion, scarf-laugh, or clarify and
test his similes? Yet his'use of “the Irish
metric mode,” probably unconscious, has a
charm for the ear rare in Australasian verse:
’Tis fine \to feel \ the tall | reeds | against |
the fin- | ger-tips |
The feet | dance- \ dancing | to the \ • white |
stream’s | strain. . . .
Boyce Bowden is the bard of the storm and
the sea—and the little black hat. He gets
the fury of the gale as few other bards do;
but then he lives in Wellington. Boyce Bowden
has painted Wellington and her suburbs as
no other bard has done before, a little local
achievement that is worth more than a
larger but more diffuse canvas. The Welling-
ton City Council, between gales, should
publicly crown him with a wreath of golden
gorse; and his “Wet Weather” should be
recited at every municipal banquet. This
page wonders how many copies the Welling-
ton Public Library has purchased for its
citizens, and in how many Happy Valley and
Silverstream suburban residences this lordly
tribute to those places reposes on the draw-
ing-room table? As doubtless the Happy
Valleyers have never heard of it, here is
“Happy Valley’':— _
Happy Valley.
I know a lovely valley that is open to the
South.
Girl, come with me! Oh, come with me!
there's magic in the place!
The city has Its fingers on the corner of your
mouth:
And the mantle of the city makes a shadow
on your face!
The road down Happy Valley is , like a
woman’s scarf;
It is pink within the hollow and pink upon
the rise!
Girl, come away! Oh, come away!—I want
to hear you laugh,
And I want to see the sunlight in the wonder
of your eyes.
The air of Happy Valley holds a hundred
little tones:
The wind is off the ocean and there's music
in its note,
And rinkle! rinkle! rinkle! runs the river
o'er the stones;
And I want to hear an echo from the glory
of your throat.
The hills round Happy Valley are dotted, o'er
with cows;
And there are sheep upon them, and many a
browsing horse;
And I want to see the fingers of the wind
upon your blouse,
And I want to hear the rustle of your skirt
amid the gorse.
The sky o'er Happy Valley is very blue and
clear!
A lark is high within it, just a little trilling
speck!
And I want to take the melody and place
it to your ear,
And I want to see a sunbeam put an arm
about your neck.
The hunger of the city and the terror of the
noise!
Girl, come away! Oh, come away, and tread
the road with me,
The road down Happy Valley that goes
winding 'mid its joys,
And we’ll follow and we'll follow till we find
the open sea!
And—a salted olive in the feast —here is
“The Hat” :—
The Hat.
They've carried him up, they have laid him
down,
With the smell of the harbor upon his
clothes:
The strange little man who was bopn to
drown,
With the little blue face that nobody
knows.
The point of the chin and the curve of the
throat
Are hidden from view by a brave cravat:
And he's buttoned up close in an overcoat;
But Ids head is bald—and he's lost his
hat!
Somewhere or other beneath the quay,
Bobbing about within easy touch,
Yet hiding away so that none may see,
Is the little black hat that he needs so
much.
The old black bowler that went with him
When he walked out under the midnight
skies:
The sheltering crown and the pulled-down
brim
That hid the purpose within the eyes.
The little black hat which I fain wotild
place,
Since he may not wear it upon his head.
Across the eyes and the little blue face,
And grant him the privacy of the dead.
So here is my handkerchief; even that
Must hide him from those who are round
about.
For a whistling urchin has found the hat,
And is kicking and kicking it inside out!
Louis Lavater takes himself seriously, as
a v good sonneteer and a goodly lover should.
A Lover’s Ephemeris (Endacott. Melb.) is
chiefly sonnets—neat, scholarly sonnets, not
meaty or Masefieldy, nor soaked in too much
thought, with here and there a pretty
phrase, like the melancholy moon “lantern-
ing the -lonely waste of sky,” but for the
rest, just vague sonnet-mist, a nebula of
faintly-glimmering beauty. Here is his
“White Magic” :
Through clefts and crannies of the darkness
glide
The long white fingers of the pallid moon;
She kneels upon the verge; then, rising
soon,
Casts her adrift and swims the sullen tide.
And to 1 the deeps where furtive shadows
hide
Are turned to wine-of-amber, senses swoon
And weird imaginings but reach their noon
Which drowned in darkness else had Slowly
died.
Beneath the beading surface, fathoms down,
Do huddled houses lie, or in their place
A ghostly semblance. There’s no dwelling-
space
’Ticixt trail and wall, but glimmery silver
.sheets
Buttressed with ebony—a phantom town
Where shrouded spectres goggle in the
streets.
Well, you get your impression cut of that,
despite the word “noon” dragged _.n for the
purposes of rime, and the intrusion of words
like “wine-of-amber” (whatever vintage that
is), “sullen” (unnecessary) and “fathoms”
(too nautically precise), and the use of
shop-soiled words like “swoon,” “weird” and
“pallid,” and the clumsiness and the vague-
ness of the meaning of the eighth line. /\nd
“goggle” hurts. It too clamantly suggests the
motorist. It wouldn’t hurt in a Masefield
sonnet, though. In so careful a workman,
too, it is surprising to find one sonnet with
two Alexandrine lines in it.
“A Dream Voyage” is an interesting and
successful experiment in a curious rime-
scheme. But “A Groomsong,” which one
must assume to be the song warbled by the
bridegroom while the bride is waiting at the
church, has a ludicrous aspect. Thus the
happy man sings as he dresses: —
And let me choose from garments in array
The whitest linen... .and this suit of
grey
(The asterisks evidently include his under-
clothes, braces, socks....)
Whate’er be pleasing in the eyes of her
iFor whose delight they have been laid away
And sprinkled o’er with myrrh,
Rose-leaves and lavender
Against this moment whereto I was born,
The flower of all my days and my sweet
~ marriage-morn.
A poet who puts his wedding-pants away in
myrrh and rose-leaves and lavender forbids
us to take the rest of his epithalanium as
seriously as Louis Lavater takes himself.
Ella McFayden writes siiicerely and sim-
ply of the war. Songs of the Last%Crusade
is not on sale at any booksellers, but may be
ordered through them at Is. 7d., posted. * All
profits go to war funds. She writes of
“Socks” and “Letters,” of “The Hospital
Ship”:—
Empty sleeves and crutches,
Faces scarred and grey,
A little band gf broken men
Are coming home to-day.
Of “Crosses on Gallipoli” :
What costly spending saw the ivorld in this;
Youth, courage, high adventure, loyalty,
Boy lives of poets, leaders, teachers, saints,
Expended in an hour — Gallipoli!
Just the commonplace themes, touched
with sentiment that seldom deepens into
pathos, done simply and directly, the reaction
of a sensitive soul to the impact of the war,
these verses are of more value than the
sophisticated art of a finer craftsman. Jhla
McFayden is seen at her best in this, the
title of which she owes to an anti-Conscrip-
tion speech in which occurred this sentence:
“The men of N.S.W. should remember that
the women would stand by them in this time
of crisis.”
STAND BY YOUR MEN!
Stand by your men!” I thank you for that
■ watchword;
“St. George for England!” might have
served as well,
Or that old Cairo catch-phrase at the Land-
ing
That led our men to glory ere they fell.
Stand by our men—and where shall we
behold them?
Laid on Gallipoli in shallow graves;
Gulfed in dark holds that dragged their
human cargo
Down to the hunger of the rav’hing waves.
Stand by them? Aye, Armentieres gave
them pillow;
Posieres hath spread their coverlet of dust,
A hundred nameless fights saw their transla-
tion.
In God’s name stand by them! Makegood
your trust.
Was it dare-devil sport, or thirst of glory.
Or lust of slaughter, made them battle’s
toll?
That forced their rebel bodies to conscription
Beneath the shining mandate of the soul?
That was conscription. Hard and bitter
service;
More disciplined for being self-compelled.
If they that bade farewell turned laughing
faces,
Were we so blind their meaning %cas with-
held?
Our men—-who arc theyf When the Uni
drafts mustered 111 st
That unknown boy marched bn
smooth, fresh brow, J-'-tthe
The TaVlJfT 9 tor m.
If you remember him, stand by him note!
When the long files streamed out of Opntmi
Station 1
The other night, grey-haired but lithe nf
limb,
One bore his foresworn years like any young-
The grand old liar—will you stand hi
him ? y
Our men, who wait for peace in German
_ "I "OILS,
A y ir 4 misery in every day;
Our men ivho club the thinned platoons
luge ' er *
And f - .■ from dawn till dark; and dark
till day.
We, the free people, makers and unmakers
Are we afraid to use our weapon then? ’
Must we cry out lest it should cut our
fingers?
Strike hard, strike hard and stand by your
men!
And you, who tie your laggard to your
apron,
And leave our men to see the battle
through —-
When the day dawns we greet our ragged
victors,
Stand by your coward, he’ll have need of
you!
♦
The competition for one--guinea for the
best Australian nursery-rime closes next
Saturday. Entries, which must not be ■paro-
dies, should be addressed to this page.
The first number of N.Z. Capital and
Labor Monthly Review (22 Customs-
street E., Auckland, M.L.; 7d.) makes a:
dull beginning of what, with good editorship,- 1
should develop into a useful monthly
magazine. In this issue the figureheads are
allowed too much opportunity for official
platitudes and too liberal a display of their
own portraits; but if the magazine is to
survive it must reach out for writers with
definite ideas, and must make good its pro-
mise to suggest "a positive policy of social
reform.” What help that policy gets in the
present issue from a fiction department occu-
pied by two popular American writers, deal-
ing with hoboes and the Alaskan wilds, or
an illustrated “write-up” of a touring revue
company, it is difficult to discover.
Robert P. Thomson adds another to our
histories, A' 'National History of Australia,
Neio Zealand and the Adjacent Islands
(Routledge. per Sydney Book Club). His
excuse is wapt of a liliabie, fairly-
connected and consecutive account of the
events of Australian history” ; but there is
no warrant that the inquirer or earnest
scholar has hitherto had only disconnected
and incomplete records. There are at
least two short histories that are authorita-
tive and complete. This Australian his-
torian’s method is to take each State or
country separately in the order of its founda-
tion, and carry, on its history in a water-
tight compartment up to the time when
Australia became one country politically.
After Federation Australia is treated as a
whole, and a large sectipn is added giving
details of the part played by Australia and
Maoriland in the great war. The Northern
Territory, Papua, Fiji and outlying islands
are also separately treated. Thomson’s
style is dull, and his judgment of men and
events is conventional. And, according to
him, there is not, and never has be6n. any
literature in Australia —and this surely is
a definite condemnation of his qualifications
as a historian. By omitting all reference
to this country’s literature, Thomson would
give the overseas reader the impression that
we possessed none. There is, however, in
his scrappy index one reference to poetry.
This is “Poetry, Australian patriotic”; and
an eager reference to the page discloses the
fact that the only poet regarded by Robert
P. Thomson as worth quoting in his history
is Robert P. Thomson. lie quotes five
alleged poems in full. From these we learn
that: —
Far to the west, Australia’s rocks
Roll back Pacific’s wat’ry shocks;
and he calls for
Three cheers for the lads of the cadet parades, \
High let the chorus swell,
Of praise for the boys of the young brigades,
That serve Australia well.
This cadet march we learn was written * to
encourage the boys to gladly submit to
compulsory training,” and it has been set
to music; but the historian does not say
how much or how gladly it encouraged them.
His latest effort ends with this awful
stanza: —
A nation t small for a mighty land,
Thy sons are chiefs in ev’ry scene*
Where tests athletic and skill’d demand
Nerves untiring and vision keen;
But proud their sporting vict’ries won,
In field, or wave, or air,
Of things more grand thou bast well begun
To claim a glorious share;
For Anzae’s battle deeds proclaimed
Write they heroes far renown’d.
And high in science and music fam’d
Inventors gnd Artists thy name-have crown a.

VARIOUS VERSE
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
An Idyll of the Marshes.
The green frog down beside the pond
Is neither very old nor wise,
But to his mate who dwells beyond
The banks of sedge and moss he cries:
“Wall! Bobalonka, bobalonk 1”
Which means, “I love you more and
more.’’
“Wall! Bobalonka, bobalonk—
You are the soul that I adore!”
And when she hears his mellow note.
Although she is so young and coy,
She swells her dainty, speckled throat,
In answer to his placid joy:
“Awa ! Kawa-wa ; wobbalong !”
Which means, “You know. I’m yours alone.’’
“Awa ! Kawa-wa ; wobbalong—
I am your love, your very own.”
I have no mate to answer me
With sweet responses when l call,
And envy them, both he and she,
Who have achieved the best of all,
When, through some sleepy afternoon,
I hear them answer, song to song,
Or greet the rising summer moon
With “Wah ! Kawa-wa ; wobbalong !”
Perchance, before my youth has died,
And all my dreams of love have flown.
Some voice across life’s sluggish tide
Will murmur “I am yours alone!”
He glories in his old refrain,
And always gladly answers she—
But must I ever wait in vain
For my own mate to call to me?

A Tremor Runs.
Across the night a tremor runs.
The moons and stars so gay
Thrill with delight, while distant suns
(Arcturus and the little ones)
Wax joyous, so that they
Shout great hosannas down the, night
Spurred by that tremor exquisite—
The tremor of your lips of rose,
The tremor as your eyelids close.
(All this, though much I long to hide you
In worship, as I sit beside you.)
The errant moons that see through space
Have burned their hearts out in despair
Because they cannot see your face.
The comets leap, each from his place,
To find themselves among your hair.
Starbeams and moonbeams lisping play
About you, Sweet, each where he may,
While meteors hurtling down the sky
Flash out in flame to catch your eye.
(Your triumph’s meet, as well I know.
Where’s solace, since I need you so?)
Deep in the night the tremor dies,
Dawn pales the moons and stars to sleep.
The tender languor of your eyes,
Aweary of such ecstasies,
Tells me I’ve still your heart to keep.
Your breath comes softly ; softer seems
That proud red mouth as, lured by dreams.
You murmur as you sink to rest,
And cling, your head upon my breast.
(I care not if the truth be stated
That moons and meteors go unmated.)

The Gods.
Each in his heart some god enthrones
To whom each day his worship goes;
Demands for help to Kingdom Come,
And solace for his tiny woes.
The holy Christian smiles -with scorn,
To see the yello.w man placate
Ilis Joss with roasted duck, while he
Just drops a “thrummer” in the plate.
And when the yellow heathen gives
His Joss, for ills received, a bump,
The Christian scoffs. What would he do
Had he a god that he could thump?
He blames his god, just as things are.
For nearly all his earthly ills;
And tries to drop a coal of fire
In this weak style: “ ’Tis as God wills!"
And yet the Christian sinner has
His little Joss himself, and gives
It worship, service and a prayer
Three times a day each day he lives.
I've seen a man his stomach serve
As well as ever pious saint
Gave service to his austere God.
I’ve seen him when his heart was faint
With things gone crooked, rush away
To make a sacrifice of fare
Well-cooked and dainty to his Joss—
And every mouthful seemed a prayer!
Then, in the confidence of food.
He faced his cares, as churchmen can
Who, having given God a sop.
Proceed to rob their fellow-man.
I’ve seen the gambler who divides
The God’s wrath of the man of prayer,
Drop in blank horror from a trapi
When thirteen happened to be there.
To me there seems this good in prayer
Within life’s strife for place and pelf:
It gives men confidence; perchance
It gives him most who worships Self.
The grocer from his pious knees
Comes, having stated all his needs;
With confidence in help Divine
Pursues his frauds—and he succeeds.
A prudent animal is Man.
With prayers or joss-sticks as may hap,
He tries to bribe his private god
To help him beat the Other Chap.

GOODRICH TYRES
FULL-SIZED.
“ Like a Pup to a Root” do they hang on to the Earth,
when you throw in the Clutch or throw on the brakes.
But, instead of merely grinding against said Earth—
for Tra6lion they Cling to it, much as your bare
foot clings to the slippery surfaces.
This new and wonderful Goodrich Alloy, called
"Barefoot” Rubber, is as stretchy almost as a pure
Rubber Band, and as light weight as Rubber in its
native amber color, when it comes raw from the
forest, but stronger , tougher , longer-wearing (in tyres)
than pure Rubber could ever be.
That Lightness, Stretch and Cling-quality is due, in
part, to the absence of the heavy and inert white sub-
stances which, in other tyres, provide the “sandpapery
texture designed to give effective but grinding
Traction when Clutch or Brakes do their work.
To provide its maximum Tracffion with minimum
Fricffion (which means minimum Heat, minimum
Tread-wear and Lessened Strain on the Rubber
adhesive between fabric layers). That’s the mission
of the new Goodrich "Barefoot” Rubber.
Prove this yourself.
Have even one pair of Goodrich Full-Sized Tyres
fitted to your car.
Then—watch results.

THE SNIDE AND DINKUM ASPECTS
OF INDUSTRY.
When an Australian citizen wants to
acquire an unreliable frying-pan, or a pair of
pants that will qualify for repairs within a
week, or boots guaranteed to admit fresh air
after two trials, or otherwise become pos-
sessed of the article of commerce that is
delusive and bankrupt of reputation, he finds
it possible to satisfy his yearnings with
promptness and despatch. In every thorough-
fare there are numerous emporiums of the
Is. variety where the quality of the
goods on sale is carefully adjusted to meet
the gullibility of the passing citizen and the
rapacity of the vendor. And where there
are no thoroughfares nor any emporiums, the
travelling van-load of rubbish puts in occa-
sional appearances, and the hawker is never
missing very long. One of the queer and
not yet adequately-explained features of com-
mercial enterprise all over the world is the
vast amount of human energy and ingenuity
directed towards the production of the pal-
try. Generally speaking, the standard of
living has increased enormously during the
last two generations. There has been an
almost undreamed-of expansion in technical
equipment, if not in technical skill. The
artistic perception of people has been sharp-
ened. The acumen of men and women in
relation to money values has grown keener.
It is no longer possible to buy an island with
a corkscrew or become possessed of con-
tinental territory in exchange for a stick of
sealing-wax and a Jew’s-harp. Yet it is
possible to annex great wealth by producing
the imitation jewel or the furniture which
collapses at the joints or the attire which
has to be frequently replaced in order that
the owner shall escape arrest and pneumonia.
Wherefore the industry of making the sham
ornament and the clothing that is a snare
and all the innumerable articles of trade
which are fraudulent flourishes more than
ever before. This may, to some extent, be
due to the development of machinery. It
may be one of the results of the ineradica-
ble passion for cheapness. Vulgarity cer-
tainly has much to do with it. and cupidity
perhaps a great deal more. But whatever
the cause, there the fact is—that everywhere
in the world brains and skill are laboring
with gilt and varnish and gloss to turn
tradesmanship into imposture, and make the
pirate with a cow and a pump the embodi-
ment of industry.
Australia has more than a sporting in-
terest in this business. The food adulterator
is no stranger here. He has been kicked many
times, but he is still on the premises. The
importer of the article at 2d. disguised to
resemble the other one at £1 17s. (3d. is fre-
quent, monopolising the restricted shipping
space. It is with this trash that the Aus-
tralian manufacturer has to compete to-day ;
and he will probably find himself up against
it in still larger volume presently when the
war is over and an impoverished world
applies itself to the job of turning out
shoddy more furiously than before. How is
the Australian manufacturer and tradesman
going to meet this? A Customs tariff will
not end the argument. When the outsider is
not only reducing the cost of production, but
also watering down the quality of the pro-
duct, the man inside a tariff is liable to dis-
cover that he has to do a similar thing ; and
when this happens the consumer soon begins
to yell that he is being taken down. Tariffs
in themselves are no protection against the
worker being sweated or the consumer ex-
ploited. On the community which sets
about protecting its industry from the
dumper and the sweater outside, there is the
obligation of seeing that the worker gets a
proper share of the proceeds and the con-
sumer of goods an appropriately respectable
article. In some countries this is done. In
some it is not troubled about. There are
countries from which manufactures can be
relied upon to be of inferior grade. There
are .others where the aim has been to pro-
duce certain articles which are the best pro-
curable anywhere—which hold the local
market by merit and attract the buyer from
another neighborhood who is in search of
the thing that is worth while.
* * * *
To what extent the world is going to
devote itself in the future to the production
of rubbish this paper does not know. But it
does know that there are only two lines on
which Australian manufacture can proceed :
it must specialise to either meet the compe-
tition of the trumpery commodity on its own
cheap ground or produce the article of high-
est quality and value. This applies particu-
larly to the utilisation of Australian raw
material—to woollen goods, to manufactures
of wool and metals, to leather, and so on.
The time has gone by when Australia can
afford to think only in terms of exported
masses of material for outsiders to work up ;
we cannot afford any longer to think even
of manufacturing only for the local market.
Our debts are now too big for indulgence in
such folly, and manufacture for export must,
whether we like it or not, become part of the
national business. Luckily, Australia has
enormous supplies of material for which
there is no possibility of the outside world
ceasing to make demand. In wool alone the
Commonwealth has an asset worth millions
more than has yet been derived from it. By
specialisation in the production of woollen
goods Australia could make nearly the whole
world her customer. It is much the same
with leather, with metals. There is no
reason why a single bale of wool should go
out of Australia in the raw. There are
dozens of reasons why it should not. The
most cogent is that the country cannot afford
to see it go. Nor is there any reason why
the woollen goods of Australia should not be
the finest on earth ; nor why the article made
from leather should not be the same. If in-
telligence and imagination are brought into
the business the brand “Australian made”
could easily become the guarantee of quality
equally in Sydney and London and Chicago.
And it will have to be either this or the other
—either Australian-made goods patterned on
the inferior produce of other countries and
specialisation in quality left to outsiders, or
the development of industries to challenge
the technical excellence which other lands
have claimed.
* * * #
To some extent Australian manufacturers
have hitherto struggled to perform the higher
and the better task. But the pressure of
competition on the lower plane is growing.
It may become greater. The danger to Aus-
tralia is of industries hereabouts degenerat-
ing to the level of the worst rather than
keeping pace with the best. This should not
be. The cheap, inferior pair of Australian
boots are no good to anyone, and from the
national aspect of industry are an abomina-
tion. The Australian cloth and blanket that
are of about the same standard as the goods
that are foisted on to people elsewhere and
purchased to provide ballast for Australian-
bound ships are no better. These things
may be commercially profitable at the
moment. But the Parliament of the Com-
monwealth should not allow them to be so.
Even if it is stupid enough to permit the
entry of the shoddy boot and the weird mix-
tures of material masquerading as “wool” or
the equivalents thereof, it ought to be able
to see the tragedy of allowing the local
manufacture of competitive commodities of
the same class. The conditions prevail-
ing lately, and likely to prevail for
a long time, are exceptionally favor-
able for establishing the superiority of
the local article, mainly because the im-
ported calamity is becoming more and more
addicted to travelling under an alias. If the
Federal Parliament was genuinely concerned
about the industrial future it would strangle
every attempt made by manufacturers to dis-
count the future and the reputation of Aus-
tralian goods by getting down to the level of
the maker of jerry-built goods. This paper
would support the appointment of a commis-
sioner charged with the job of flinging out
every article of Australian manufacture that
was not absolutely dinkum. The cheap thing
is always dearest, and the habit of making
the shoddy boot and the adulterated suit and
the disreputable clothes-peg only requires to
take l'oot, and it becomes harder to get rid
of than prickly-pear. As producers of snide
goods there are outsiders who could tread
Australia as flat as the journey for the. Mel-
bourne Cup. As producers of that which is
dinkum there are few who would be serious
rivals of Australia, for none have such
ample supplies of good material to work
with.
WEEDS.
The weed crop of Europe is magnificent.
Except in those regions where the war-shells
have ploughed deep and the machinery of
war treads heavily, the docks and thistles
are having a riotous time, lood must be
produced The fields are being labored to
the last point of productiveness which the
limited supply of agricultural man-power
will permit. But the merely ornamental
is neglected. The garden, once trim and
sleek for pleasure, has become a wilderness;
and the lane and hedgerow matter nothing
as long as there is room for the waggon to
pass. Every race makes its own artificial
landscape. There is a Saxon district of very
ancient settlement in the north of France
where the farmsteads and fields present
exactly the appearance of those in Hamp-
shireand the dividing line between Celtic
Cornwall and English Devonshire is as
sharply drawn by the look of the roadway
as by the features of the people them-
selves. But war writes itself in one
uniform hand across all countrysides, and the
characters in its alphabet are rank and
growing weeds. The finer things of life
are whirled into the war-smoke. No one
can stay to prune the rose-bush or water the
pansy bed. All the sweet energy of ordered
life is flamed and furnaced into something
sterner and less beautiful; and when it is
gone the weeds get their chance and rise up
with zeal to blur out the traces of former
culture. Happily, the realities remain
through all the changes. It was a fine deed
of peace to tend that rose-bush in the quiet
days; but larger roses of self-sacrifice and
devotion bloom where the big shells are
bursting, and there are whiter lilies in the
passionate tears of those who suffer in the
world’s cause. Life is more than material
while high thought can lead to noble action ;
and the weeds cannot choke out all the
sweetness of things. In wars of old times
the weeds sometimes seemed to have won.
The Roman legions left Britain a garden;
the first Saxon invasion filled it with weeds.
Two centuries later it was an oak forest.
The weeds had, in fact, grown into trees
over the graves of the best of the con-
quered ; but the garden came back again
with lawns more trimly kept and flowers
making a gayer carpet of bloom. That man
would be a traitor to the hopes of all his
race w r ho dreamed that the weeds could be
the final victors.
* * * *
Nature in every field of action has a
curious lack of originality about her methods.
Everything she does in one sphere rhymes
with something else in another sphere; and
it is out of these rhymes that most of the
music of life is made. The sweetness of
every rose has a girl’s mouth to rhyme with
it; the blackness of every night a grave for
its counterpart. Weeds planted by w r ar in
the garden or the lane-side are but the type
of other weeds which have an equally rapid
growth in the human field. With the call
to the big fight came the opportunity of all
the baser and more useless things which had
been kept down by the hoe of public opinion.
All that w r as best in the nations concen-
trated itself on the grand effort to break
the power of the common foe. There was
no longer time to keep the garden of man
clean and trim and attend to the little
things while the one big and overwhelming
thing was waiting to be done. The ill weeds
grew apace and so flourished at the expense
of the nations that to some eyes they
appeared to be the nations themselves.
Nothing could be in greater contrast than
the heroism under the most trying condi-
tions of the men at the Front and the slack-
ness w T hich finds its voice in strikes, peace
propaganda, I.W.W. outrages and the like
in the very places which the fighters are
striving to save from disaster. Mad, sudden
impulses of peoples pressed by hunger or
worn out with suffering are to be under-
stood. But, except perhaps in the case of
Russia, these momentary upheavals have
been singularly absent. The troubles that
have to some extent weakened the Allied
arms have been of the deliberately planned
kind which, while recking nothing of the
great causes at stake, were built up on a
weed growth of false thinking and crooked
observation. The teaching, for instance, of
the I.W .W. that something better is to be
gained for man by indiscriminate brutality
to man is not the result of any sudden and
alarming pressure of misfortune. It existed
always among criminals of a certain type
who, owing mostly to the conformation" of
their skulls, wrought robbery and violence
for personal gain under the plea that they
were at war with society. The weeds were
always there, but the hoe of public opinion
kept them down. Since the outbreak of
the war, however, that public opinion has
been almost wholly concerned with other
matters—matters which bulked so hugely
that they dwarfed into nothingness any
mere attempt to keep the national thought
on logical lines. It was the nation itself
that was in danger—the nation and the
world of nations—and little time could be
spent, until the foe was defeated, in debating
what shape national reforms should take
So the I.W.W. weeds grew in the neglected
garden of thought, and a few noisy adhe-
rents were gained for the strange creed that
the bashing of the boot into the world’s brain
was the surest cure for the awful reaction in
social conditions that permitted the laborer
to earn twice as much as his father had
earned and four times as much as had left
his grandfather content! Similarlv and for
the same causes the strike evil grew—
a weed that sober Labor had striven to
eradicate a quarter of a century before.
.Similarly, too, the anti-national feeling of
military-shirk-and-sit-down-licked was "fos-
tered. All were weeds growing apace be-
cause the national hoe had been thrown down
to attend to the personal needs of the
Kaiser.
* *
* *
But none of these weeds can remain as
permanent features of the landscape The
moment the German guns are silenced the
destruction of the weeds must begin as a
matter of course. In point of fact, thev are
not very robust nor deeply-rooted. though
they make a green and sappy showing in the
absence of the man with the hoe. But the
" world’s thought now concentrated on
the Kaiser and his works must soon be re-
laxed, and immediately the good cultivate
will return to trim up his own garden That
he will trim it up in earnest is bevmJ
doubt. In the fiery test of war he' has
learned that garden’s value. Its flower-beds
and walks have been bought with warm
young blood, and every corner of it i s too
sacred to be allowed to remain untended
Before the war lie was a little careless with
the hoe, a trifle indolently contemptuous
towards the dull-lookmg green things that
would persist in showing their heads between
the nobler growths. On his return all that
will be altered. Nothing that can weaken
in the smallest degree the big harmony of
the peace he has secured through sweat and
tears and blood can be allowed to show a
malignant leaf. So the ending of the war
will be the beginning of a period of strenu-
ous national thought and action, a period of
reconstruction and reassertion of world
faiths ; and in the white blaze of a big pur-
pose the thought-wmeds will be burned up
With the war raging, the bread pro-
blem is the only one that concerns the
tiller of the soil. But the world w r ants a lot
more than bread. When the weeds are gone
the roses can get free room to open them-
selves to the sun ; and men are learning more
deeply and more truly than ever how neces-
sary the roses and the heartsease and all the
other flow'ers of life are. After all, the
danger is not so great. The better and more
enduring shrubs of the garden may be
affected by the weeds, but they will main-
tain themselves somehow in spite of it.
The smaller and more delicate things must
suffer for the moment; but a single season of
steady toil wall bring them back again in
all their sweetness of color and form. The
seed is not lost; the cultivator’s skill is not
forgotten ; the rust will come off the hoe at
about the tenth stroke into the soil. Mean-
w’hile the Kaiser remains to be beaten, and
every blow 7 aimed at him is indirectly struck
against the weeds also
OUR NEW ALLY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Vancouver, September 25.— Information has
reached the Administration circles in Washington
that China will send 200,000 well-trained troops to
France.
“Bad marksmen might as well have no
arrows,” says the Ping Fa, the oldest mili-
tary textbook in the world. “The foundation
of victory is a Government which knows its
own mind,” wrote a Chinese Minister of
War a thousand years later. But the death-
less truths, good for all ages and all nations,
were by the Chinese, themselves sadly
neglected. In the tragic war with Japan,
which made China first realise her weakness;
scores of different sorts of ammunition were
issued to the troops. They would be poured
in a heap on to a blanket and the soldiers
would be told to take their pick. So a com
fused medley of men, armed with cast-off
patterns of all the rifles in the world, would
scramble for corresponding cartridges. Then
they would go forth to meet the well-
equipped armies of Japan.
In a provincial capital I once watched a
squad being put through musketry drill.
They were learning an elaborate and com-
plicated ritual, a mixture of gymnastics and
posture-dancing, whose object w’as to bring
them from a standing position to a firing
position on the ground. Their arms were
so rusty and unclean that I did not expect
them to be intended for firing at all; but
there w r as a two-foot-square target about a
hundred feet away, and at this they let fly.
When the infrequent hit w r as registered a
gcng was beaten and murmurs of wonder
and applause arose from the spectators
On the other hand, some of the forejgn-
drilled troops, such as those of Feng Kuo-
chang, are unsurpassed. The residents of
Shanghai in the second year of the Revolu-
tion had a unique opportunity 7 of seeing both
sides of the picture. From the neutral
ground of the foreign settlements they were
able to watch the conflict of the old order
and the new. They watched the ill-armed,
undrilled, undisciplined rabble of the rebel
army throw itself with fanatic valor against
the barbed-wire entanglements, deep trenches
and scientific formation of the Republican
army. Four dollars down, with the promise
of another four upon victory, turned your
house-coolie or rickshaw-runner into a rebel
soldier lying out night after night under a
heartquaking fire of shrapnel, machine-gun
bullets and eight-inch shells, armed with a
rifle whose mechanism he did not under-
stand, to advance at dawn against modern
troops in deep entrenchments. And they
only desisted when their generals, withdraw-
ing the remnant of the rebel funds from the
foreign banks, departed secretly for Japan. _
In just the same spirit Liu Fu-piao’s
famous regiment, the Dare-to-Dies. advanced
across the open against the Woosung forts
and were mown down in hundreds without
being able to fire a shot. In just the same
spirit the Imperial war-junks went out, not
once but many times, against the whole
might of Britain’s eastern squadrons. And
at the battle of the Yalu the Japanese them-
selves report that after they had smashed
the Chinese fleet to fragments, two battered
Chinese ironclads that remained afloat actu-
ally steamed after them when the Japanese
withdrew.
Of the valor and steadfastness of the
Chinese soldier, when properly led. there i-
not the least doubt; but on the actual mili-
tary resources of the Republic it is useless
to dogmatise. Corruption and disorganisa-
tion are so rampant that statistics are
almost worthless. When a Provincial
Governor states that he has a military
strength of 50.000 he may only mean that
be draws the pay of 50,000 men. maintains
sufficient forces to police his district and
keeps a large stock of uniforms into which,
on the advent of a high official, he hurriedly
stuffs the rabble of the city. The efficiency
of the ships of the navy varies with-yfii
efficiency of their commanders. When
Admiral Sait, a brisk, dapper little man
with a brown, wrinkled face like a walnut,
had his flagship, it was kept like a British
man o’ war. Rut he had passed through the •
British navy. „
Out of the Sha-mo, the “sandy waste
which, once the home of a vast population,
is now slowly suffering a process of desicca-
tion. came the great hordes which again and
avain ever-run Asia, pushed whole nations
out of their former boundaries and received


their final check only at the line in France
where the German hordes are now being
held. Born in tents, bred to the saddle, liv-
ing on mare’s milk, and used even in normal
times to the extremes of privation and endur-
ance. they formed a primitive striking force
which the rude military science of Europe
was powerless to withstand. Nature, with
more subtle weapons, has vanquished them,
and their fertile plateau is. now a sandy
waste. Their heirs, the Chinese, have lost
the military tradition, but have retained
their hardy virtues.
“As go ()( ] iron need not he used for mak-
ing nails, so no good man should be a
soldier." But Western cwilisation, laying
rude hands on their weakness, has forced
them towards military expansion. The raw
material is there, unspoiled. The old endur-
ance. the strength with frugality, above all
the fecundity are still there. No one who
has landed at a Chinese seaport can fail
to be impressed by the vast extent of the
native shipping, of the floating cities of
fisherfolk. living, marrying and dying on
salt water; of the dexterity, discipline and
seamanship of the native crews, often
women with babies strapped to their backs
or children of five and six. No one can fail
to be struck by the ceaseless activity of
Chinese industry, an industry that knows no
half-holidays, no Sunday rest, that labors
all day and half the night and only pauses
for a few days at the New Year; an intelli-
gent and adaptable industry; an industry
living on a diet that would starve an invalid,
and all the time a cheerful industry. The
rickshaw-puller in the course of his day’s
work performs feats of physical endurance
which would kill a modern athlete, and he
does it on a ration of a bowl of rice and a
bit of salt cabbage.
The Age of Steel has caught the Chinese
unawares. They lack the machinery of
finance, government and production; but
they have limitless numbers, unbounded
natural resources and sound national char-
acter. Character is the slow 7 growth of
ages, machinery of the last century. The
people who are hoping for any considerable
help from China in this war are looking for
w'ater out of a rainless sky ; but in the next
war things will be different.

PLAIN ENGLISH.
A Cocked Hat that Missed a Word and
the Bull’s-eye.
At an Agricultural Society lunch in Mel-
bourne last week Governor Stanley took
the assembled tucker into his confidence and
explained what loose views about govern-
ment can find shelter beneath a Cocked Hat.
Stanley’s oration in the main was a quaint
mixture of platitude and originality, all of
which boiled down to this reflection :
War limits our freedom.... We owe an obliga-
tion of mutual toleration, mutual consideration and
support to those who govern us. . . .The constitu-
tional freedom and right of citizens to criticise Gov-
ernments, which are rarely free from criticism, must
be abated and minimised.
Must they, indeed? Then presumably
Hughes shouldn’t be where he is, since he
wasn’t even a Minister when the war
started ; and Asquith should not have been
disturbed. In Russia also there should have
been mutual toleration, and Rasputin
should have remained the power behind a
corrupt throne. Yet, though as samples of
almost sublime fatuity, Stanley's remarks
are entitled to the loudest bray of derision,
it is only because one single word was
omitted. If Stanley had decorated his yarn
with two additional syllables he would have
found himself talking the highest wisdom
instead of the profoundest rot. That word
is “Party.” Is there a man in Australia who
will deny that the party criticism and defence
not only of Governments in their political
aspect, but of administration —the party
discussion of all public questions and
national issues—is an abomination? Or one
who will deny that there are scores of vital
reasons why it should be throttled? Ibis
thing called Party is the poison of popular
government all the world over. It is the
most sinister danger to democracy in time of
war as in time of peace, eternally driving it
to reaction. In this country it has demor-
alised Governments and people alike, it is
only through criticism that popular govern-
ment can function, and when this is shack.yd
by Party the evil effects are almost as great
as when government proceeds on the princi-
ples approved by the Great Mogul. As a
matter of cold fact, the constitutional free-
dom of criticism the people are supposed to
possess is being filched from them by pai y
mongers and political bosses, and we are
governed, not by ourselves or by Govern-
ments, but by hidden wirepullers.
Governing “like Billy-oh.”
As the kids say. But in Federal politics it
is needed now‘to express the Gadarene rush
of the Prime Minister to contempt. Only
the other day the S. M. Herald warned him
off intervention in the miners strike, with
the dry remark : .
If Mr Hughes makes the mistake of interfering
now, when his intervention before proved to be such
a failure, judged by its results, he will find that he
has antagonised the great majority of citizens in
N. S. Wales. . ,
Yet the Herald goes on hoping that the
disastrous word-spinner who can howl Yah.
yer mind’s like a toad in a cesspool in a
dozen different ways, each dirtier than the
last is still the fellow to win the wai . But
the Svdney Telegraph is beginning to have
its doubts. Discussing the thing that began
as a tax on eligibles and ended as a bachelor
tax, it said : —• . .
The Senate need have no fear that it is going too
far with its requests for the modification of this
extraordinary Bill. If it demanded its indignant
consignment to the Parliamentary wastepaper-basket
it would do no more than justice to the sense and
spirit of the community.
Win the war like Billy-oh is new looking like
what it is, and even to the Billy-oh press.
It aims to dodge the responsibility of putting
the right policy to the country and
the Government stand or fall by it, so that
Australia unled. undirected except by viru-
lent language of abuse and fantastic distor-
tions of the truth, has become the only Hm-
ited liability belligerent among the Allied
nations fighting for democracy ; and so that
in Maoriland they call us “Austra-aliens”
and job-snatching emigrants to countries that
have shouldered their full burden of the war.
“Dodge” is the essence of Billy-oh govern-
ment, and contempt is its reward. Austra-
lian taxation is therefore all dodge and very
contemptible. The Income Tax is computed
on a formula that no ordinary elector or
M.P. can understand, and that even sneaks
where it might openly take the taxpayers’
money. The country having refused Con-
scription, an attempt was made to dodge it
into fining the limited class of single men
who exercised their right not to volunteer.
That dodge failed. Now a still wider class
is to be fined for not marrying, if a slightly
less impudent dodge can be worked. The
idea in the scheme is pictured by a pack of
greyhounds worrying a poodle. The poodle
can’t run away from them and can’t fight
them, or even give them all a good meal.
They go for him like Billy-oh and look very
busy for a time. When it is all over they
rush off for a cat, and so they fill in their
time and keep themselves warm without risk.
Billy-oh government is all bluff and bounce
for the personal comfort of the Billy-ohs.
It does nothing that needs courage. The tax
on eligibles was to put hosts of decent men
into a despised and stigmatised class, while
robbing them. It w r as an outrage that the
rounding-up of a few rich and cowardly
shirkers could not justify in the least. The
tax on bachelors, up to 5 per cent, of their
income, is the creation of a social distinction
among taxpayers that penalises the unmarried
supporters of other men’s families and brands
them as inferior citizens in comparison with
the “fly” married men who have wives but
no families or only enough to show that
“they could an they would.” The Billy-
ohs know that a tax on men who can but
don’t marry would be a tax on only about
5 per cent, of unmarried men and would not
pay the cost of collection. But the unmarried
men are a small class of voters and a class
that melts continually into the class of the
married. They know, as well, that mosr
unmarried men, if they haven’t other family
responsibilities to carry on by some chance
of fate, are almost always saving to get
married, and must wait the longer if robbed
of their savings. They even know that
many of those who exercise their right to
remain unmarried are, like the poet Cowpek.
the historian Macaulay. the soldier
Kitchener, perfectly good citizens, and no
more deserving of penalties than other men.
But Billy-oh wants cheap activity and easy
victims. It daren’t face war-profiteering,
reinforcements, or going to the electors on a
Conscription policy that may risk its jobs.
It is just Billy-oh—loud and blustering to
little ’uns and no harm to the real Huns.
N. S. Wales Financial Slide.
The report of Auditor (general Cogiilan on
the N. S. Wales Treasury accounts is a
repetition of the story told in this paper
many times. It is all about a State which
with increasing revenues is never able to
get round the corner —about taxation heap-
ing up from year to year and debt being
accumulated in huge lumps. The perjury
about “reproductive enterprises” and the
“development of our great natural resources”
can hardly raise even a laugh these times,
for even the boomster and the blowhard are
unable to explain away the resemblance of
the public cash-box to a colander. Before
the war the State’s investments earned a
surplus over working expenses and interest
of £262.768 in 1912. In the following year
there was a deficit of £445.462. and during
the last financial year the State had to raise
£1,011,265 by taxation to fill the chasm.
From 1913 to 1917 the allegedly interest-
earning investments have been managed with
such prudence that they have accumulated
a deficiency of £2,599,255, for which the
public has had its pocket raided. Direct
taxation has been increased every year, the
State’s collections apart from business
undertakings having been raised from
£6,361,029 in 1913 to £8,627,652 last year.
The State debt, which before the war was
£106.170,747, is now £138,135,347. with the
certainty of being increased by four or five
millions’ at least before the summer expires.
The interest bill was £3,556,697 in 1912;
last financial year it was £5,144,722 —an
increase of 45 per cent.; and that, of
course, doesn’t include a penny of the inter-
est on the war debt. And so it goes on,
every year’s experience covering with ridi-
cule those who have told the people that
debt would make the country prosperous.
The end must nearly have been reached of
this mad performance, for no country could
stand such a strain even if war were ban-
ished from the earth.
Gentlemen, Hookworm!
Dr. J. H. Waite, of the Rockefeller Inter-
national Health Commission, has already
shown pretty clearly that hookworm disease
in Papua is of quite recent introduction, and
also that it is a plantation disease as yet,
not a village disease. Nearly all the cases
found were in adult males who were \vork-
ing, or had recently worked, on plantations.
Women and children in the villages were
almost free from it. All of which points
very clearly to the fact that now is the time
to get busy on it. Once the villages become
infected —and this will not take long—the
value of native labor will decrease rapidly
by reason of individual deterioration and
of a much increased mortality amongst
adolescents. Both forms of the worm are
found in Papua, the Necator americanus
and the Anchylostomn duodenale. The
former is the more fatal, but the latter holds
some high records in the way of crippling
industrial undertakings—in the Simplon
tunnel and the Westphalia coal-mines, for
example. Hookworm has existed for long in
North and Central Queensland—cases have
been reported from within 40 miles of Bris-
bane —but, so far, does not seem to have
produced any serious results on a large
scale. All the same, it is not safe to neglect
it. and the cold reception which Home Secre-
tary Huxham seems to have given to Dr.
Waite’s proposal for a £ISOO subsidy to a
scheme for hookworm eradication in North
Queensland affords further evidence of the
fact that State politicians care less than a
hoot in Hell for the protection of the
people’s physical welfare. Returning troops
will bring with them an unavoidable pro-
portion of men infected with hookworm, and
other tropical diseases as well. The total
cost of a scheme which would safeguard the
whole of North Queensland against this seri-
ous disease is about £SOOO, of which the
Rockefeller Institute is willing to pay some
two-thirds if the balance is put up locally.
It is surely time for Australia to take mat-
ters of this kind out of the hands of State
Governments already overburdened with the
needs of keeping strikers sweet for the next
elections by means of State pubs, State
butchers’ shops, State sympathy with dis-
obedient railway men. and similar important
lubricants for the parish pump.

One Big Union.
The collapse of the strike and the general
atmosphere of decay and discredit which
official Labor is forced just now to breathe
are still worrying “H.E.8.” of the Worker.
who, in fierce wrath that anyone should ask
him to follow his own statements to their
logical conclusion, screams in big capitals
against the infamy of describing the State
as a Union. When, however, he comes down
to alleged argument this is the gist of what
he has to say :
Before the State by anv stretch of imagination
can be considered as One Big Union it must evolve
an economic system which prevents the organised
exploitation of one section of its population by
another, and secures to each of its citizens the fuil
results of his industry.
The capitalistic State cannot do that. It is
founded upon legalised and sanctified ROBBERY.
All its institutions are shaped to fit in with the fact
of a community roughly divisible into robbers and
robbed....
The One Big Union, on the contrary, will be a
true confraternity of purpose. Its members will be
moved by wrongs that are borne in common to fight
for rights to be enjoyed in common.
But “H.E.8.,” despite his blaring capitals
and his unproved assertion that he does a
little “quiet” thinking now and again, is in
statements like these merely clouding the
question. In a previous issue it was pointed
out that “H.E.B.’s” One Big Union to
replace the many sectional unions, and
governed from the mass rather than ruled
by its leaders and bosses, differed in no
respect from the State itself as Labor, with
its preponderance of votes, might easily maKe
it. “H.E.8.” objects to this on the ground
that the State is founded on robbery, but
does not make the smallest attempt to
prove his statement or explain it. That
there are robbers in the State is quite clear.
They are found among the wealthy ex-
ploiters as well as among the agreement-
breaking unionists whom “H.E.8.” so fre-
quently supports: but the fact that there
are robbers in the State does not prove that
the State is based on robbery any more than
the roaring capitals in a Worker article
prove that the art of political writing is dead.
The State is what its people like to make it;
and it is not appreciably better for what
Labor in power tried to make it. But the
real question at issue when talking about
the State as a big union is whether
“H.E.8.” is or is not willing to trust the
free voice of the. people as a whole expressed
from time to time through the Referendum
with Initiative. There will be robber voters
at every Referendum poll—robbers on both
sides—but the great bulk of the electors
must always be Labor men and women. If
“H.E.8.” is, as he has stated, unwilling to
leave the power in the hands of bosses and
committees and is also unwilling to trust
the people as a whole, by whom does he pro-
pose to work the miracles of unspecified
reform he so ardently desires? His reply is
that One Big Union made up of all the
workers in the State can achieve the desired
end. But if that One Big Union were really
formed, it is obvious that it would include
nineteen-twentieths of the electors on the
State roll. Why go to all that trouble of
organisation for the sake of a 5 per cent,
minority when the State is already organised
and the simple expedient of the Referendum
with Initiative will place the whole conduct
of affairs directly in the hands of the
workers? At any rate, what is the matter
with giving the people this chance against all
their exploiters both in and out of the
official Labor ranks?
Wages and Production.
To prove that the go-slow disease doesn’t
exist, Frank Tttdor, leader of the Federal
Labor party, put it this way at an Eight
Hour gathering last week in Sydney :
Figures given by the Commonwealth Statistician
show that in 1913 the wages paid in factories
throughout Australia amounted to £33,606,000,
whilst the output of the factories was worth
£161,560,000. Consequently the wages represented
20J per cent, of the value of the output....ln 1915
the wages paid were £33,212,000; the output of
the factories increased to £169,086,000. Thus in
that year wages represented only 19i per cent, of
the output. These figures convincingly prove that
....there has been a decrease in the wages paid in
proportion to the value of output from £2O 15s.
out of every £IOO worth produced to £l9 10s.
It is abundantly evident that the wages cost in the
production of manufactured commodities is gradually
becoming less.
This is a first-rate sample of an argument
full of holes. It takes no account of expendi-
ture on plant. It leaves out any reference
to expenditure on power. No reference is
made to (1) variation in the cost of
material, (2) changes in selling price, or
(3) fluctuation in the character of the out-
put. There are very many establishments
in Australia which find themselves paying
substantially more for the material they
use, and selling their output at a higher figure
because of this higher cost. Some of these
produce more not only in value than they <■
before but in volume also, and some produce
less. It is very easy to lump these together
and say: “The output was valued at
£1.000.000 in 1913. The wages paid were
£250.000. But in 1915 the output was worth
£2.000.000 and the wages paid only £450,000.
Therefore wages in relation to output are
going down.” But it is also silly. The
doubled output may have involved more than
100 per cent, additional expenditure on
material. There may not even have been
a doubled output. For the purposes
of the case Tudor wishes to estab-
lish. the figures prepared by Iynibbs when
employed in this way are useless, for the
further reason that wages paid in produc-
tion at one factory are carried on into the
cost of material used at another. Thus a
hide worn by an animal passes through three
and perhaps four establishments before being
issued as a boot. A piece of wood may go
through half a dozen premises, each paying
wages and buying the finished article of a
previous process as raw material. All this
confusion and more prevails in these aggre-
gated statistics. To prove that Labor’s re-
turn is going down (apart from considera-
tions having reference to the purchasing
power of money) it will be necessary for
Tudor to pay very earnest attention to the
relationship of raw material, the value of
fuel, the cost of plant and the over-riding
charges (which are the same often on a
small output as on a large one) to the value
of the final output. And this can only be
satisfactorily done by concentrating on par-
ticular cases.
Dear Bulletin, —The trouble is that “the
unwritten law” is never (or never has been
in my experience) invoked to save a person
of no social account. In contrast with the
result of the case quoted in “When _ Old
Adam collides with the Law” (B. 20/.-//T7),
this may be interesting. About 1880-1, at
Barradine (N.S.W.), there was a large
camp of semi-civilised blacks. One of
these, called Albert, was employed as a
police tracker. He was married to a gin
by tribal rites and lived in the camp
with her when not on duty. Another black
called Migal Jack seduced Albert’s wife
and also announced that he would kill
Albert if the latter interfered. Migal
Jack had narrowly escaped being hanged
for murder before this and was a “bad man
generally. Albert went to the camp and
one night found his gin and Jack in the
same blanket. He went back to the township,
borrowed a shotgun, loaded it with ball and,
returning to camp, shot Migal Jack through
the chest, killing him instantly. Unfor-
tunately, the bullet went through his gin
as well and killed her also. Albert took
back the gun and reported to the police what
he had done. At the magistrate’s trial he
explained that it was the law of his tribe
that a man who stole another man’s gin
should be killed by the outraged husband;
also that he did not mean to injure the
woman, although the tribal law would have
justified him in that also. There was no
evidence to refute this, which was well
known to the police. Albert was tried in
Dubbo —by Judge Docker, I believe, and a
jury—for murder. The verdict was guilty,
and he was hanged in Dubbo gaol. Not very
long after this a similar case occurred in
Paris —an earlier Thaw case, and the jury
acquitted the man. Such is the majesty of
the Law ! —C. H. Souter.

even that rite is omitted now on troopships.
The ship I am writing on, according to the
Board, is fit to carry under 600 passengers.
I have seen 1100, and the crew, aboard in
the danger zone, and this with no extra
boating accommodation. Some of the
boats, at one period, had not been in the
water for 17 months. That is the point
where we are going wrong. The overcrowd-
ing of vessels is in the circumstances
unavoidable; but that makes it far more
necessary that we should take more even
than the ordinary precautions with regard
to the boats. It took a year to discover
that the motor-boat intended for towing
the other boats could only be got out of
one ship by cutting through several iron
railings. Anyhow, it would have made no
difference that trip, because, after leaving
England, it was discovered that the benzine
had been forgotten.

“Bad Australian” from the spot:—
The sinking of the Monte Protegido by a German
submarine followed so closely on the Argentine
Government’s declared approval of and adherence to
the principles which caused the United States to
make war against the Central Powers that the Argen-
tine people accepted it as a direct challenge, and while
the diplomats were awaiting details of the occur-
rence the people of Buenos Aires took the initiative
into their own hands. They paraded the streets
carrying the national and Allies’ flags and singing
the Marseillaise and demanding war. Later they
smashed-up the German newspaper offices and stores
until the troops were called out for the protection
of the Huns and their property. The captains of the
interned German and Austrian steamers were so
impressed by these indignant demonstrations that,
believing war inevitable, they removed or destroyed
part of their engines, thus rendering them useless.
On this being discovered a strong guard was placed
on the ships to prevent further damage. The
German Minister raised a wild howl of protest
against this, but he was courteously reminded
that the action had been taken in response to his
demand that the persons and property of his
countrymen might be adequately protected by the
authorities! While the Government appears to be in
some doubt as to the proper course to pursue, the
people are holding meetings throughout the country
demanding to be led against the barbarians of
Europe who have trodden on the dignidad of the
Republic, and when a South American’s dignidad is
deliberately wounded, he is madder and more whirl-
ing than a scalded cat.

“F.N.P.” : Australia will never get ahead
industrially unless there is more co-opera-
tion and less selfishness among manufac-
turers generally and especially those engaged
in allied trades. Take, for instance, the
attitude of a section of motor-car body-
builders towards the embargo recently placed
on the importation of motor-car bodies.
Although body-builders rejoice in the fact that
they are to be protected by the embargo, it
has been ascertained that a section of the
men engaged in this industry have forwarded
to the Minister for Customs a petition pray-
ing that a complete set of standardised fit-
tings may come with each chassis imported.
If the plea is successful, it means that local
manufacturers of subsidiary pa iff s, such as
mudguards, body-panels, lamp-brackets, etc.,
will be compelled to go on fighting their sec-
tional battle against the overpowering com-

ECONOMY AND THE FARMER.
ECONOMY has become the popular cry. But the experience
of farmers during - the past couple of rears is not likely to
make them enthusiastic. The only solution of the farmers’
problems is the establishment of co-operative enterprises which will
minimise the cost of handling their products and provide their
necessities at cost price.
The Farmers’ 8 Settlers’ Co-operative Insurance Co. of A Limited
is one such enterprise. Owned by co'operating farmers and con-
trolled solely in their interests, this company, while affording
absolute protection at lowest current rates, aims at reducing the
cost of farmers insurance to the absolute minimum. And it is
doing it. WRITE THE MANAGER FOR PARTICULARS.
petition of the foreigner who wishes to dump
his goods in Australia. The sudden prefer-
ence for standardised fittings is rather re-
markable, too, in view of the fact that in
the past the builders would never entertain
the idea of standard panels, etc., being made
and supplied by local firms, requiring a dif-
ferent design for almost every car. They
got them, too. Now the standardised panels
will do—providing they are imported. If
the selfish petitioners have no regard for
their fellow-tradesmen, the Minister should
teach them their duty.

Another Winter Away from Home.
The net result of the recent peace talk is
that there is nothing doing, and the German
Chancellor announces the continued deter-
mination of the Kaiser to shed the
blood of his loving subjects in defence
of stolen property. But there is a
very marked difference in the Germanic tone
of voice nowadays. Not long ago the talk
was of an irresistible Hun marching on to
victory. Later it was of the same indi-
vidual announcing that the other crowd were
beaten, anyhow, and were foolishly getting
into further trouble. Now the yarn is
about a Germany consciously fighting with
her back to the wall —a Germany measuring
her own miseries with those of some of her
enemies and reckoning she can endure longer
than they. Well, the German may be right
in this; but there is very good reason for
suspecting him to be wrong, since the
appearance of Uncle Sam in the disturbance
gives the Western Allies an immensely
greater staying power than they possessed
before. Yet even if he is wrong we here-
abouts will be making a tragic error if we
omit to heavily discount everything that is
said about the Allies being “masters of the
situation.” When it is meant to imply that
Germany is on the verge of a crushing defeat
it becomes mischievous to the point of trea-
son. At the very best the mere business
of ejecting the enemy fi’om Belgium is a
contract of frightful difficulty. And what
is occurring in Russia remains an uncertain
factor in everything connected with the con-
flict. Some of the possibilities over in that
direction are almost too shudder some to
think about, and it is no good trying to for-
get that the picture dimly seen from day
to day has so far commenced to look no
better. Meanwhile the enemy has again
been mauled in Flanders, Australia’s troops
have been holding their end up among the
rest, and our old friend the Turk has been
given a hiding to go on w'ith in the vicinity
of Bagdad. It has been good to hear, but it
should help to again remind everyone that
the journey ahead is long and the road
rough, and that winter will soon be settling
down on the place where the issues which
matter most on this earth are being decided.
The Peacock Government has passed at
least one weighty measure this session, so
the time of 99 statesmen has not been
wasted. The law referred to is the Bar-
maids Act Amending Bill, by which some
half-dozen pump-ladies who omitted to regis-
ter themselves last year are now enabled to
do so. Its passage was a great v/ar-winning
feat, and fully makes up for the loss of the
Charities, Health, Metropolitan Council.
Metropolitan Tramways and a dozen other
trifling innocents that were born again, to
be slaughtered once more.
Kerensky of Russia is suffering from
tiaberculosis of the kidneys, and has already
parted with one in an endeavor to get relief
fronu the trouble.
Pa'lmer, M.H.R., is hunting down poison-
ous Fj)uns with an enthusiasm that is worthy
of moAe official support. Recently he pro-
duced the case of a naturalised German who,
as a sPeaf of testimonies proved, persist-
ently ported Frightfulness into the ears of
Australians, but apparently convinced the
Defence 1 department that he was only
indulging in fun. This is but one case of
several in vphich the Defence Department
has shown a strange reluctance to curb
enemy utterances. Freedom of speech seems
to be tolerated .mong local Huns because
the Defence Department probably thinks it
a fair thing to allow it somewhere.
Adelaide has lost A. M. Simpson, who had
built up the largest tinware factory in Aus-
tralia. Also he was a great citizen in every
way, having been chairman or treasurer or
director or committee-man of pretty well
every public enterpri.se or charity in sight.
Politics did not interest him much. His one
term in the Leg. Council happened to be
just at the start of payment of members; he
detested the idea, and signified the same in
the unusual manner of giving the whole six
years’ salary for a fund to encourage rifle-
shooting. He was himself one of the earli-
est volunteers, in middle age had mines
made in his factory to meet the Russian
scare of 30 years ago, and only last year
made a single-handed gift of a biplane to the
Defence Department. The end came after
an operation at 74. Alan Simpson, a recent
Mayor of Adelaide, is one of the sons.

“The New Sin” that Basil MacDonald
Hastings invented and added to our deca-
logue at the Sydney Playhouse last Satur-
day, is the sin of being alive when you are
better dead —a sin, it must be confessed, that
a good many of us are committing ; and the
theatre-goer who steps lightly into the Play-
house seeking festivity and frivolity will
grumble that Basil Hastings is guilty of it,
too. But what the serious playgoer, if there
are any of him left, or the individual jaded
by the unsatisfying fare provided by the
other theatres, will find is a deeply interest-
ing dramatic novelty. The drama is tense,
thrilling, talky but seldom tedious. It is
modern realism diluted with Shaw. These
young men talk about everything on earth —
journalism, sweating, the tired-business-man,
and woman. For though there are no women
in the cast women pervade the background.
It is a play without heroics, but full of hero-
ism ; and everybody ought to see it for the
good of his, or even her, soul.
* * * *
For his new sin the dramatist has to
depend upon an eccentric will —the weak
spot in the play. For a playwright can put
his hero into any extraordinary situation he
likes if he only makes his father’s will
eccentric enough. Thus he loses sympa-
thy, since nobody in his audience
could conceive himself in the harrowing
position the dramatist had delibertely created
for his hero. Hilary Cutts was left in this
position by his late father’s will. Until
Hilary’s death none of his brothers and
sisters could touch a penny of their father’s
fortune. They are a lot of rotters, but they
are starving, or w’orse; and Hilary just
makes enough by his art to live. After a
night’s debauch the young man casually men-
tions to his friends that he is going to com-

mit suicide. He certainly adduces evidence in
favor of his action. His friends argue with
him, but, as his mind is made up, one of
them suggests that if he has to die why
shouldn’t he die as the murderer of some
gross scoundrel, for whose taking off the
world would be the better? Hilary is ex-
amining his revolver when a notorious
sweater is unexpectedly shown into his room.
On this subtle climax the curtain falls ; but
the next act finds the two in the same posi-
tion. To his surprise Hilary can’t help
liking this blatant individual. Then Max,
Hilary’s younger brother, an employee of the
sweater, dismissed for good reasons, arrives
starving. A brilliant scene follows, in which
the points of view of sweater and sweated
are cleverly and fully discussed. The upshot
is a shot fired by Max that kills the sweater.
Hilary takes the crime upon his shoulders,
and we learn in the next act he is to be
hanged. This last act leads to an unex-
pected denouement.
An admirable cast interprets the play.
H. R. Roberts, without one accent of melo-
drama, easily and convincingly portrays the
casual and cynical hero. Frederick Ward,
who “produces” the play, gives a memorable
presentation of the mean, slinking rat of the
degenerate young brother. As the gross
sweater Herbert Leigh is convincing; Clive
Farnham and Claude Turton do their best
with the long discussions provided for them
by the un-subedited playwright; and in the
final act the former holds the audience in a
brilliant cross-examination scene —not in a
law-court. Frank Hawthorne as a garru-
lous man-servant and David Drayton as a
moneylender fill useful rOles. There ought
to be enough people in Sydney interested in
the serious drama to fill the Playhouse for
the short run.
“A Pair of Silk Stockings,” Marie
Tempest's fifth play, has been given its first
Australian run at Adelaide Royal. It is
one fine bedroom scene sandwiched between
two acts of talk. So much explanation is
needed, indeed, as to suggest an original
first act now suppressed, in which Molly
had thrown over Jack to marry Sam, against
whom she has since got a decree nisi, refus-
ing to listen to his muddled explanations of
innocence. Also Jack has despairingly got
engaged to an uninteresting young girl. Now'
all parties barring Molly are at a country
house, and she drops in late at night. Jack
is just leaving, and the ladies put her in
his room, while a sporting bachelor-girl tells
Sam wffiere to find her. A purely farcical
rehearsal of “Caste” proves to be just the
author’s device for getting Sam into old
clothes and a beard, and in that rig he
hides in the wardrobe. Then, with Molly
in bed, enter Jack innocently by the window',
having missed his train. The “burglar” is
detected but not recognised, tied up with her
silk stockings and bundled into the bath-
room, and the tw’o old friends discuss past
and future over a cigarette. Greatly are
they tempted, but Molly still thinks of Sam,
and Jack must play the game tow'ards his
fiancee —who at this moment is heard at the
door. Common-sense, wffiich w'ould say “Oh,
come back in the morning,” would spoil the
play, so she is (idiotically) admitted.
Naturally she thinks things, and the burglar
chaperon has escaped by an open window’.
(Strong curtain.) After which, of course,
the whole house looks sideways at Molly till
it pleases Sam to produce her stockings as
evidence for the defence. And the bachelor-
girl, the one true sport of the lot. pushes
them into each other’s arms, and Jack—
whom she loves herself —into the girl’s, and
lives gloriously unhappy ever afterwards.
* * * *
A new Miss Tempest is seen in this play,
more womanly and less feminine, since here
the author (Cyril Harcourt) is not chiefly
concerned with making her score off the other
cat. There is more of art and less of arti-
fice ; less, for instance, of the squeaky change
of voice which won a sure laugh from the
unthinking. Frank Harvey plays up to her
grandly, and the bedroom scene is a thing
to remember. Graham Browne revels in
the up-to-date slang of the muddled Sam,
Eileen Robinson rises to her one moment as
the fiancee, and Gwen Burroughs—greatly
improved—-has a sure touch as the sporting
girl. Leslie Victor for once over-acts, and
Sydney Stirling, so prominent in previous
plays, is not seen.
The grotesque ” “Grumpy” gave way on
Saturday at Sydney Criterion to an ingrati-
ating Irish doctor wffio blarneys his way
through one of the most delightful comedies
seen lately in Australia. “General John
Regan,” by George A. Birmingham, is the
simple story of how an American tourist
determines to wake up Ballymoy, the dead-
est place he has struck in Ireland. He
bluffs the simple Ballymoyans with, his yarn
that he has come to make a pilgrimage to
the birthplace of General John Regan, the
Aapoleon of Bolivia, whom the American
had invented that moment. Fie is amazed to
find no statue of the hero in the market-
place. Luckily Doctor Lucius O’Grady
enthusiastically determines that the village
must provide that statue ; it will bring cus-
tom to the village, liquidate his debts to the
publican, and if the Lord Lieutenant can be
persuaded to unveil the statue Ballymoy
will not let him leave without getting
from him a Government grant for a pier or
at least a free supply of seed-potatoes. As
the doctor truly says, the only use for Lord
Lieutenants is to make speeches and dis-
tribute English money in Ireland. How on
a fragile basis _ of unsubstantial credit the
statue is provided and triumphantly un-
veiled forms the subject of a rollicking Irish
comedy.
* * * *
It is a play of genuine Irish types. As
the Irish doctor Cyril Maude triumphantly
proves himself as a character-actor. In this
almost straight part—therefore a severe test
of artistry—there is not the slightest sug-
gestion of Grumpy or of the gross exaggera-
tions with which Cyril Maude overlaid
that ancient. Without the least over-
emphasis he is just a charming, wheedling
and resourceful Irish medico. A character
part as flawless is that of the editor of The
Connaught Eagle (Stephen Scanlan), a
fervent Home Ruler whose bitterness against
the oppressor compels him to incessant
patriotic speeches. The parish priest (Alfred
T. Turner) is another character drawn
the life; and Betty Murray, an actress 5
poss'luhties as yet merely glimpsed at, makes
o Mary Lllen a genuine comedy part. Frank
Elhott should be at once engaged at enor
mous expense as A.D.C. to the incomW
Mate Governor; no aide hitherto starred in
Australia looks so beautiful or possesses hu
perfect futility and his lordly mannri,
Every aide in Australia should join his
A.D.C. officers’ school. Herbert Ransm
who is cast as the American tourist is the
only failure. But, after all, O’Grady i s the
play. The Screen scene from “The School
for Scandal,” in which Dorothy Gumming
looks beautiful and Cyril Maude looks
Grumpy, precedes the comedy.

a bellowing British Admiral—the sort
that is never allowed afloat. He storms
into the hero’s bungalow in Japan at
the end of Act 1. convoying the meek young
American heiress he has selected for his
naval-lieutenant son, who already has his
chaperoned White Chrysanthemum estab-
lished there. To keep the old seaman from
going insane, the Chrysanthemum cleverly
disguises herself as a Jap by putting on a
kimono. Then the show settles down to
live riotously for three acts on the interest
of that invention and the fact that Barry
Lupino, the spry and chirpy Cockney purser
on the yacht of the visiting English Johnny,
is forced into marrying a large Jap widow
with a numerous family in order to escape
three comic Jap policemen who want him
for exceeding the speed-limit in a motor-car.
The humor of the piece depends too much on
his sudden reappearances from the innards
of a sofa or a well. Hardly anybody is
surprised when revolver shots are heard and
he drops out of a suspiciously large hanging
lamp; lots of patrons would demand their
money back if he neglected such an obvious
opportunity. One gets an impression of a
whimsical little man working himself too
hard and gagging too much. The book needs
trimming. The co. isn’t strong vocally, and
when the audience asks for a repeat of some
air the management should be able to give
it, instead of shutting off abruptly. The
music is better worth listening to than the
dialogue.

perhaps the fact that Virtue is a glorious

sufficient excuse for patronising any bizarre
entertainment. Sydney makes no such ex-

“Itobbery Under Arms,” as produced at
the Hippodrome, suffers a good deal by com-
parison with early productions of the Aus-
tralian play; but considering the difficulties
facing Anderson and George Cross (pro-
ducers) at the back, it is surprising that the
results were so satisfactory. The acting is
level (that’s non-committal enough, isn't it?),
and more than a good word is due to John
Ricketts and Rege Robins for the scenery.

ing the woes of the
pore farmer and the
sins of the middle-
man, was reckoned to
be a faithful repre-
sentation of outraged
dignity in drink. The
old man’s policy of
raising Dave’s rent
ten bob a week as a set-off to the
half-sovereign rise in his wages was
applauded feelingly by both landlords and
tenants. Also a deep impression was made
on the multitude by the picture of the ole
’un dozing off whilst the surrounding Rudd
family was anxiously giving him room to
think. And in Act 4 there were pauses for
laughter when Gran’dad formed his relatives
into an awful singing class, for the purpose
of increasing the output of the cows by
warbling to them at milking-time. There is
no question as to some of the comedy in this
second Steele Rudd play being better than
the best in its predecessor. The familiar
characters seem strengthened with confidence
in their own realism. The dialogue is
smarter, the action is easier, and the group-
ing is excellent. But possibly there is too
much of it all from townsfolk’s point of view,
and they might like the play better if it
were pared down. Anyhow, the box-office is
now talking over the subject.

Mr. Manhattan con-
tinues to be em-
broiled in complica-
tions by his trustless
valet at Melbourne
Majesty’s. The musi-
cal comedy that bears
his name provides
three hours of joy—of
a sort. At any rate,
there is a fair quan-
tity of girl in it, and

A new revue sketch at Melbourne Tivoli
was introduced with a flourish of advertise-
ment which proved misleading. “The Prince
of Monte Carlo,” with Roxbury in the fore-
front of the two-scene frivolity,. is the
ancient story of a buffoon endeavoring to be
funny under false pretences. Roxbury has
a heavy hand for fun-forcing, and as a comic
duellist in the second scene he is handi-
capped by public recollections of dead or
gone comedians who did exactly the same
thing with different results. The Follies
are still scoring in the tragedy of the Luna-
tic Asylum, and J. C. Mack repeats lus
“tabloid” panto, exactly as at first. But
why not drop out some of the minor details
now time is going on? American drolls
rarely strike the happy medium. 1 hey are
breathless or a bit long-winded. They hustle
or they crawl.

Olga Petrova is throwing her wardrobe
open to the world in “The Soul of the Mag-
dalen” at Hoyt’s Melbourne house this week.
The film is the work of the Metro firm which
has ransacked the Noo Yark furniture em-
poriums to provide the somewhat wooden
heroine with suitable backgrounds. An
ornate sob from England entitled “Profit
and the Loss” declares that plutocrats can
be driven to philanthropy by presenting them
with Bibles. This is a tip worth considering
by the Phewsion Government. A bombard-
ment with copies of The Word might be
more effective than the War Profits Tax.

The inevitable has happened at Adelaide
Tivoli. Fitzherbert, torn between his nat-
ural desire to be a hero and the fate which
makes him an artistic villain, has split in
halves and become both. The occasion was
the .Tekyll-and-Hyde twins in “The Evil Men
Do.” Gladys Gaul put up a clever study as
a boy and ‘ltoland Conway is welcome back
in the Anderson Co. The Majestic has
dropped its simulated “revues,” and gone
back to all-Variety. with Custo’s monkeys as
a novel turn; and the Hayseeds drama,
originallv filmed in Adelaide, comes back to
West’s with the seal of travel and approba-
tion upon it.
AT POVERTY POINT.
“J.”: When the late Harold Ashton was
managing the J.C.W. co. in which Tittell
Brune was the star, he was forced (it hap-
pened at Christchurch, in Maoriland) to dis-
pute with her certain things she claimed as
her rights. In the heat of argument the
little actress was rude to poor Harold, who
was one of the kindliest men in the business.
After the show was over he was sitting in
the office trying to find excuses for the star
and attach the blame to himself, when there
was a knock at the door, and Miss Brune’s
maid entered with a letter. She explained
that Miss Brune had instructed her to deliver
it first thing in the morning, but, seeing his
office lighted, she thought she would hand it
in at once. Ashton thanked the girl and
opened the despatch :
Dear Mr. Ashton. — 4.30 a.m.
After a sleepless night, worried over our little
misunderstanding, I trust that when we meet at
lunch all will be forgotten.—Yours truly,
Minnie Tittell Brune.
“J.F.H.”: Northeliffe’s Evening News
has been publishing reminiscences of London
music-halls, and Harry Rickards is intro-
duced. He is described as a “big favorite
and deservedly so, for lie was one of the best
of the old ones.” In the ’seventies and
’eighties he was a popular “lion comique”
with such ditties as “I’m Captain Jinks of
the Horse Marines,” “Up in the Gallery”
and “That Is What the Country Wants to
Know.” Harry’s final appearance in the
London ’alls before settling in Australia was
in the wig and gown of a barrister, singing
“His Lordship Winked at the Counsel.”
Harry also tried some coster songs, but
never achieved Albert Chevalier’s success.
Harry’s costermonger was a bit too like the
original. Gorgeous enlarged photographs of
Harry are still displayed in the vestibules of
some of the London variety houses, pre-
sented by himself to catch the eye of old-
time acquaintances.
“Gazer”: Raffaele Steffani, SO years old
and living in complete retirement in a
quaint little villa at South Yarra, knew
Verdi, and has many yarns to spin about
him. He also met Wagner and Wagner’s
second wife, the notorious Cosima, whom he
rapturously describes as “Bellissima!” At
the first performance in Italy of “The Fly-
ing Dutchman” Steffani was in the next box
to Wagner, and afterwards chatted with
him. He is a witness to Wagner’s enthusi-
asm for Italian treatment of his operas. “I
must have Italian singers for my work,” ex-
claimed the composer—a bowl-over for those
who persist in giving us Wagnerian opera in
the guttural German. Paganini is Steffani’s
musical god. He has a wonderful painting
of him, which properly should find a place in
one of the conservatoriums. Donizetti and
Bellini share the rest of his still youthful
enthusiasm, although, unlike many Italians
of a past generation, he has some admiration
to spare for Wagner—the havoc-working in-
truder into the old Italian domain of opera.
Cables announce the death in London of
the original “Floradora” heroine —Evie
Greene. She was long one of England’s most
prominent musical-comedy stars, and was
latterly a most acceptable head-liner in the
principal vaudeville houses. Frank Greene,
for many years with J.C.W. and Mclntosh,
is a brother.
Marie Tempest unveiled in Adelaide a
roll-of-honor to 200 soldiers recruited from
the Williamson firm’s staff. The unveiling
was made the occasion for a ceremony on
the stage, with a speech by Lady Galway,
but the tablet is to be shown in the porch of
the Royal.
Greean McMahon has changed the pro-
gramme for his next Repertory season m
Melbourne. “The Dumb YV ife, which was
threatened as a curtain-raiser to a revival
of “The Pigeon,” has been withdrawn fiom
training, and another playDt. ‘ Over the
llills.” has been rehearsed instead. ima
little piece is by John Palmer, who has
long and earnestly at the drama through the
distinguished columns of London Saturday
Review. The trifle shows the effect ot
marriage on the romantic temperament, ai
is light and whimsical.
“ Ah Gee”: lie the Bailey-Grant version
of “Julius Caesar,” “Sundry Shows’ says
( B. 13/9/T7) : “The burning of the late lam-
ented in the Forum, instead of taking the
remains to the sacred crematorium, is a
melodramatic anachronism. ’ W ell, I lutarch
is authority for it: — .
But when Caesar’s will was opened, and it was
found that he had left a considerable legacy to
each one of the Roman citizens, and when his body
was seen carried through the market-place and
mangled with wounds, the multitude could no longei
contain themselves, but heaped together a pile ot
benches, bars and tables, which they placed the
corpse on, and setting fire to it, burnt it thereon.
“T.V.T.”: No Go Slow in the circus
business. I travelled with Wirths as a
“big-top man” in 1915. The duties of a
“big-top man” are to help to erect the big
main tent, or "big-top,” as the profession
calls it; also seats, menagerie tent, etc.
During the performance he must either assist
in the ring or remain on guard outside to
prevent small boys from wriggling in undei
a flap of the side-wall. When settled down
in a big city there is not much to do; it
is the one-night shows that kill. After the
performance tents have to be taken down,
unlaced, rolled and packed away on the
elephant waggons, with the poles, seats,
“jacks” and all the incidental gear. Some-
times before the last waggon and cage are
on the move it is one o’clock in the morning.
The weary “ ’ands” snatch a few hours
sleep on the train and wake up at the next
town, where, after breakfast, they are hard
at it again. It’s not so bad in dry weather,
but when the canvas is wet, the weight of
the side-wall sections and tent-quarters is
increased about fourfold.. When a storm
strikes the huge tents it is almost as excit-
ing as being in a gale at sea in a wind-
jammer. I remember a wild night in the
hospital ground in Adelaide when the
menagerie tent came down. The acetylene
lights went out, and the terrified roaring of
linns, bears, seals and sea-lions could be
heard above the din of the storm. In the
midst of the confusion one of the massive
king-poles came crashing down, narrowly
missing a group of workers. The ands
best friend is the elephant, the great brute
with the strength and wisdom of the ages.
“J.F.H.”: London Referee has started a
discussion on the advisability of securing an
actors’ M.P., arguing that the proposed in-
crease of amusement taxes brought this need
“clearly into the light of practical expedi-
ency.” The Strand, which holds most ot the
London theatres and music-halls, is about
the only constituency in which an actor-
candidate would have a good show ot
success. Henry Irving was mentioned tor it
once or twice, and there was a time when lie
could have headed the poll. Oscar Asche
says the suggestion has his “whole-hearted
approval” ; but they don’t all think like that.
Gerald Du Maurier calls tue proposal fool-
ish,” and Pinero does not consider the 1 ar-
liamentary representation of professional
groups practicable. What he wants is a
Minister of the Fine Arts, as in I ranee, who
would have charge of the interests of all the
artistic professions.

THE MORAL.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I go to see the picture plays,
For 1 am very much alone.
1 love the hero’s gentle ways,
And quite a tenderness have known
For, say, a dozen splendid souls
Who play the heavy lover voles.
But 1 must change
My simple ways for morals strange
If I would please
A wondrous gentleman like these.
It is, alas! the woman fierce
Who is as naughty as can be,
With coal black eyes that grill and pierce,
And tigerish proclivity,
Who always wins the noble bloke.
It borders on a subtle joke
Upon a lass
Who doesn’t burn the midnight gas
In cabaret,
And drink the bubbles as they play.
The girl who in some Yukon hell
Hits up the pace, and dances mad,
Her too conspicuous charms to sell,
Reforms and gets the gallant lad.
The city Magdalene is blest,
Goes good, and marries of the best.
The moral is:
There is no man for guileless Liz.
She is not warm,
And so, poor girl, she can’t reform I

“Trooper Bluegum”: This old desert has
its surprises; and we met one as we crawled
into camp the other night. We were under
canvas at an old Iloman well in the
wilds of Sinai. The days, spent patrolling
the hills and the wadis, passed inter-
estingly, but in the evenings time hung
heavy on our hands. One night, how-
ever, the patrols returning late lizard
with a thrill a brass band beefing
our the “Anvil Chorus” in camp, and as they
drew nearer that music gave way to Harry
Lauder’s “Rrroaming in the Gloaming.” It
turned out to be only another item to the
credit of the übiquitous R.F.C. An airman,
knowing what a deadly place we were in.
had flown out with a gramophone and a dozen
records and then streaked back to Moascar.
“Hippogriff’s” affidavit with this: —
A brigade of Australian artillery was at Helles
and one of the batteries owned a wild devil who
loved not the impersonal butchery of the guns. He
was forever ducking away to the front trenches,
always to join up with the same mob—a Tommy
regiment. They thought the world of him for his
utter ignorance of fear, and when they went over
the top he generally managed to be taking a holi-
day on the spot, and led the way. One day he
discovered his pals very depressed by the ravages of
a Jacko machine-gun. There were no bombs and a
rifle would have been useless; so Bill borrowed a
waddy and went out with caution (loz.) and enter-
prise (1 ton). In half an hour he was back with a
machine-gun. The 0.0. Tommy regiment recom-
mended him strongly for the V.C., and the papers
in connection with the case were sent to his own
0.0. for identification purposes, etc. This mandarin,
however, didn’t think that his untidy gunner was
at all the sort of person to wear the Cross. A
General who lived in a hole on the beach had to
decide the matter. He sent for Bill and said, “Now,
would you sooner have a bottle of whisky or the
V.C. ?” Bill, after a moment’s thought, replied:
“Well, if I could have the whisky now”
* * * *
“Chal”: Even on bare Gallipoli Sgt.
Dennis had a genius for “finding” useful
articles, and his dugout looked like a villa,
with cocoanut matting, small folding chairs
and table made from kerosene cases. But
“Birdy” on a round of inspection discovered
the “possy.” “Nice dugout,” he said. “Who
hangs out here?” “Sgt. Dennis? H’m, I’d
like to see the sergeant. Those chairs and
that matting have a familiar look.” When the
sergeant arrived and saluted: “Comfortable
quarters of yours, Sgt. Dennis. I’d like to
know how you got the furniture.” Perhaps
there was a twinkle in the General’s eye,
but Dennis did a daring thing when he
decided to appeal to the sporting side of
the chief. Drawing him on one side, he
whispered confidentially: “You can’t get it
of a day time, sir, only at night!” For a
moment Birdy hesitated; then, smiling,
passed on with. “Sergeant, get it back to the
stores to-night!”
“J. Len”: “Te Babarantiko” (B.
12/7/T7), when talking of “German New
Guinea” and the adjacent islands, was evi-
dently suffering from the
usual overdose of quin-
ine. Here is the other
side of the case. I’ve
been earning a living in
the maligned districts
for the last two years
and never felt better in
my life. Not so very
long ago an insurance
doctor let me get past
him for a solid sum, and
he didn’t seem to think
that the climate called
for any loading. Fur-
ther, I’ve often wanted
to see just exactly how
a man would look when
down to a big dose of
fever; so far I’ve not
found a horrible example.
And, mind you. I live less
than 40 miles from
Ilabaul. Don’t let any-
body run away with the
idea that nobody ever
gets ill here; but an
average man can live
comfortably so long as
he forgets all the yards
of overdrawn tales and
refrains from filling him-
self up with drugs.
Woodlark Island is sup-
posed to be one of the most deadly holes
extant; yet I can produce at least five men,
out of a population of less than 60, who
haven’t left the island for 20 years, and
they, collectively or individually, will drink
any travelling sport under the table.

“Hawkesbury”: The attempt made at

sented themselves, all unanimous in dressing
the part in khaki breeches. They did their
best “to plough and to sow, and to reap and
to mow,” and were not too bad, considering.
But someone in authority got tired ; so they
were turned out, a remnant being sent to
Cowra. The experiment has cost only a few
thousands, and quite possibly some two or
three of the girls, after their free holiday,
may take to some form of life on the land.
Anyway, Holman is bound to float another
loan somewhere, so what does it matter?
There are still a few things that the Cen-
sorship has overlooked. It hasn’t yet in-
structed the press that if it refers to the
Prime Minister’s settlement of the big coal-
miners’ strike of last year it may only say
that it was a triumph of statesmanship;
also it hasn’t warned the press that if it
mentions “the solution of the metal pro-
blem” it may only say that everybody inter-
ested is now giving Mr. Hughes three cheers.
To other achievements of Mr. Hughes about
which the press is not permitted to say any-
thing except that the country has been enor-
mously benefited this paper is unfortunately
not permitted to allude.

One of the oldest landmarks of the water-
front at Hobart, the Mariners’ Church, built
in or .about the time of Governor Franklin,
is doomed. It has been sold and is to be
removed to Sandy Bay. Some sort of ser-
vice has been held in the old tabernacle all
along, but it didn’t trouble the mariners
much. On the wall is a tablet in memory
of the lost by the wreck of 11.M.5. Orpheus,
on the Manukau Bar (M.L.) in 1863 —
nearly 200 officers and men went down that
time. There’s a story that a little before the
vessel struck a sailor who knew the place
told the commanding-officer that they had
taken the wrong channel and were getting
into danger, and was clapped into irons for
his pains.

“Hamer”: A woman’s crowning danger is
her hair. Hardly a day passes here in Eng-
land without its chronicle of hair tragedies
amongst the war-workers, and the
account of the latest German raid is printed
alongside appeals from women advertis-
ing pathetically for assistance in secur-
ing thatch to cover a temporary bareness
of the North Pole. When Eliza’s hair
tangles itself in the machinery or comes in
contact with the flame in an oil-engine some-
thing happens. Quite frequently it is the
death of Eliza. But although attempts have
been made to meet the danger, Eliza refuses
to allow Lloyd George to monkey with the
adornment through which she spikes her hat.
An attempt to induce the women workers to
clip their hair nearly led to a strike in one
large works.
* * * *
“Corio”: One of Australia’s venerable
churches is that of St. Thomas’s, at Port
Macquarie (N.S.W.). Governor Mac. laid
the foundation-stone; and the first rector
was the Rev. John Cross, who was incum-
bent for 30 years. The bones of a military
officer are hidden under the pulpit. He had
a reputation for illtreating the prisoners in
his charge, and when killed by a fall of
stone while superintending quarry opera-
tions (that was how it was officially put)
his body was buried in the church to pre-
vent the convicts molesting it.

THE SIX-STARRED FLAG OF ANZAC.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
In the battle of Menin Road the most dramatic
incident was the planting of the Australian flag on
the captured Anzac redoubt.
The six-starred flag of Anzac
In peaceful • pride was flown
Above a lonely continent,
Above a people who, content
And knowing not what warfare meant,
To nationhood had grown.
The six-starred flag of Anzac
Was with the century born ;
Now, younger than the boys who came
To lift it carelessly to fame,
It flies, though never once in shame,
By ten great battles torn.
The six-starred flag of Anzac
The Pyramids have seen ;
The Landing its fine challenge knew ;
Above Gallipoli it flew;
Where’er were desperate deeds to do
There have our six stars been.
The six-starred flag of Anzac!
In sombre pride it waves
Where Death's battalions thick have been
At Pozieres, Bullecourt, Messines,
Where now the grass is growing green
On closely-clustered graves.
The six-starred flag of Anzac!
You’ll find that tattered flag
Wherever brave lads bore the brunt
Of ruthlesb charge or reckless stunt.
Insouciant it flames in front,
That torn and red-stained rag!
The six-starred flag of Anzac
At Menin Road unfurled
Above the battle fluttered out
Upon that proudly-named redoubt—
This starry dross that comes to flout
The devils of this world !
The six-starred flag of Anzac
Above the battle flew.
That youthful flag so new to Mars,
And yet so old with battle scars,
The six triumphant silver stars
At last old Europe knew!

“Spurs” : After nine months of the blister-
ing sands of the Sinai Desert, Billjim rode
up to the gates of Palestine and ejaculated
“Bonza!” It was Springtime, and spread
out before us were wonderful green fields
and untilled spaces carpeted with strange
wild flowers, poppies, daisies, purple lilies
and convolvuluses —a painter’s dream of
color. It was good, too. to have a bit of
grazing for the sand-weary horses and a bit
of solid earth for them to walk on. But the
glory of the place departed with the Spring,
and in place of the green fields there is now-
nothing hut fine dust which rises abomin-
ably, so that often we cannot see more than
a horse's length in front. Then there is
the red-hot Palestinian flea and the devilish
Holy Land fly. After all. the desert had its
points.
“T.M.W.’s” story: —
It was at Omeo Plains (Vic.), where the free
and enlightened had never heard a Labor tiger roar,
and Frank Anstey and Charlie McGrath undertook
to supply the want. Shortly before the hour fixed
for the meeting the pair, resting on a verandah be-
hind some shrubbery, overheard the sons of the soil
debating the reward of the strangers’ expected advo-
cacy of the bursting of the marriage-tie, etc. It
was finally agreed that the pair should he dipped in
Lake Omeo, near by. Anstey, noting the size of the
conspirators, observed to his companion, “Charles, it’s
odds on a bath.” McGrath suggested abandoning
the meeting, hut this was impracticable, and with the
parting injunction from Anstey, “Talk for your home
and beauty, Charles,” he rose to speak. He couldn’t
shake off nervousness, however, and made a weak and
disjointed speech, which left a bad effect. Anstey then
rose, and, to use his own expression, spoke with the
lake for a background. He dealt at length with the
land question, gripping local conditions, and applying
them to the principles of settlement as advocated by
his party. To hear Anstey speak at his best is
RECKONING DAY.

an experience one is not likely to soon tire of, and
after about 10 minutes a “Hear, hear” greeted the
anxious orator. This acted like magic on him, and
at the conclusion of what he reckons was the best
speech of his life, the audience rose as one man and
cheered him.

served him another. He turned on me, ’n’
never in me life did I see so sad a face. He
was not coarse about it, nor tierce, nor on-
reasonable in anny way, only sad; ’n’ sez
he to me so gently, wid wan hand up to his
throubled brow: ‘lf you please, officer,’ he
sez, ‘you might leave it to your friend. He
is doing very well!’ ”
“Trooper Bluegum”; “M.O’C.” d>-
24/5/T7) is quite right, in spite of his ex-
citement —the Australians never were actu-
ally on Gaba Tepe. The old fort was about
1500 yards from Ryrie’s Post and Chatham’s
Post, our nearest trenches. But I’m
not sure that “M.O’C.” and his pal
were “the only two who ever got any-
where near it.” The sth Light Horse
Regt. sent out patrols nearly every
night from the right of our line
towards Gaba Tepe. If “M.O’C.”
belongs to the 3rd Infantry Brigade
or 2nd L. H. Brigade he will know
that. If not, I can assure him that
dozens of patrols from those two bri-
gades—before the Turks occupied Bal-
kan Gun Pits—did get to the vicinity
of Twin Trenches, which were fairly
close to Gaba Tepe. And as Gaba
Tepe was the original objective, scores
of writers, in England and Australia,
have referred to the “landing at Gaba
Tepe.” without actually meaning the
point itself or the fort. It’s little to quarrel
over, anyway.

“A.G.”: Whisky nearly got me court-
marfialled the. other day. The adjutant’s
shirt formed itself into a company and he
handed me 40 francs to buy him a change.
I had a boshter time, got back somehow and
tried to shut one eye to stop seeing three
adjutants. Then he opened his parcel.
Spare me days if he didn’t explode and
chuck something with frills and laces at the
knees round me neck ! Some —— had rung
the changes at the estaminet.
“Stripey”: Nowa-
days fashions in drill
change faster than
fashions in hats.
Actual warfare is
teaching the heads
something new every
day, and the training-
camps are kept on the
jump. Take bayonet
exercises. On arrival
in camp in Britain
we found them i-e-
-hearsing something
better than the drill
we had learnt in a
school on the trans-
port, which was sup-
posed to be the latest
when we left Sydney,
and differed slightly
from that at the
Liverpool Camp. Pro-
bably there will be
something still newer
before we get to the
Front. As a matter
of fact, troops, no
matter how long they
have been in camp in
Australia, start off
scratch in Britain,
being treated as raw
recruits from the out-
set. This makes the
retention in Aus-
tralia of so many in-
structors seem far-
cical. They would be
better employed some-
where else —especially
the multitude of them
who have never seen
the real thing.
* *
“Hamer”: In order
that Billjim may be
“hotter disciplined” he
has now to do four
weeks’ training on his
arrival in Britain be-
fore he can get his
four days’ disembarka-
tion leave, and during
that period the neces-
sity for the salute is
rubbed in daily. Our military manners will
be just lovely when they are through with us.
Whether military manners will .help us to
Berlin is another matter.

“Quarter”: I wish I’d been brought up a
vegetarian. When we first landed in Egypt
our daily issue of fresh meat was lilb. per
man ; now it is only fib. Moreover, Austra-
lian rabbit has been issued frequently of late
in lieu of meat; and Bunny isn’t an ideal
substitute. With fresh meat one
can always count on at least
a third of the issue being
bone and fat. That reduces
the actual amount of meat left
to under half a pound per
man. Make a fry of this and
it is scarcely one meal. So
the menu is chiefly stew, with
the meat playing hide-and-
seek. With rabbit, after the
hide, head and feet are taken
away, little is left save ribs
and shanks; and from this the
cook is expected to provide
two meat-feeds a day. Rabbit
issue averages about 25 per
100 men. Is it any wonder
the men come to me (Q.M.S.)
and complain of being meat-
hungry? “Give us bully-beef
and cut out the fresh meat,”
is an everyday request. The
bully is considered much the
more filling. When one takes
into consideration that, before
the war, most of these Aus-
tralians were in the habit of
eating two to three pounds of
fresh meat daily, the meat
ration is real hardship, and
the otherwise liberal issue of
foodstuffs does little to console.
It’s meat they want. How-
ever, we have little to com-
plain of. for our enterprising
canteens are right in the front
1 lie with us and provide all the appetite can
desire —at war-time prices.
An Australian base wallah at what used
to be the capital of German East Africa :
This Dar es Salaam, meaning the Haven of Peace, is
thus called possibly because it is so easy for the
white man to die here after six months’ residence.
At present (July) it is midwinter, and clothes need
not be changed more than three times a day.
Once into the inner harbor or lagoon, through a
narrow passage, Dar es Salaam opens up like an
Arabian Nights town of shady avenues and large
white buildings amongst feathery palms. Natives of
nearly every country in Africa abound. There are
Arabs, Persians, Somalis, East and Central Africans,
West Africans, South Africans, West Indians, besides
representatives of many Hindu races. Prehistoric-
boats—very akin to the catamarans of Colombo-
and ordinary dugouts swarm about the haiboi. u
the constant passing of motor-lorries and cars and
the sight of khaki spoils the languorous illusion.
The buildings are fine, the Lutheran and R.C
churches even pretentious. The building material
is the ever-present coral, of which also the roads aie
made, but made badly. Bismarck is commemorated
in a bust on the sea-front avenue, whilst in another
street is a statue to one Wissmann, a renowned
hunter and pioneer. At his feet stands an Askari or
native soldier, with a hag gracefully draped across a
dying lion. A fine piece of sculpture. The natives
are a peaceful crowd and expressed indifference when
the town changed hands. But that the same o c
Curse is with them you may judge by the frequent
inscription upon the doors in the native quaitei.
“Out of Bounds.’’
The soldier with his left arm gone gazed
in unashamed admiration as he watched a
mate on crutches edge through the swing
doors of the pub. “Ain't ole Bill a marvel.
he exclaimed. “Only got one leg, yet drinks
beer as well as ever ’e did !”
“Chevron’*: Andy Fisher made a bargain
for Australia when he booked Will Dyson

life of Billjim on the Somme. The pictures

pressive scenes of winter warfare they.aie.
Most notable are “Australians Revisiting
the Old Battle Ground at Pozieres”; “A
Shack at Delville Wood”; “Writing Home”;
and “Night of April 1!> at Bullecourt.” The
work is being directed by the War Records
Branch of the High Commissioner’s office,
which also arranged for Fred Feist. Arthur
Streeton and 11. S. Power (whose paintings
of Light Horsemen have hit Blighty in the
eye) to visit the front. Priceless pictorial
records will bo gained, and what has been
done shows how much was lost by the fail-
ure to make similar provision for recording
the epic of Gallipoli.

“Itan” : I lately lived amphibiously for a
spell at Moree (N.S.W.). The virtues of
the hot bore-water are undoubted and should
be better known by victims of rheumatism
and nerves. Private Enterprise would have
flooded the country with advertising; but
the Moree Council takes the boon as calmly
as the residents, and seems to be satisfied
with a modest profit of under four figures a
year. The bore was put down by the Gov-
ernment about 20 years ago in the hope «f
founding an irrigation settlement; but all
that remains of the experiment is a few
siekl.v-looking lemon-trees and a mile of
piping. The water that will wash away
the racking pains is not the sort that will

whole population of Moree goes borewards
pretty regularly. There are always visitors
in the town, and the stream of pilgrims
never ceases, some going on crutches, others
wheeled in chairs or limping between sticks;
while others again are jovial athletes who
are off to enjoy a splash, fancy dive or
wrestle at the nightly carnivals.
REVENGE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
To his gay ring my heart beat pit-a-pat;
He called three times a day and every night
(His shoes had left their imprint on my mat),
And still his coming filled me with delight.
I toned my hair a different shade of brown,
And dressed it otherwise each time he called,
And salved my lips, and always changed my gown.
Though he was forty-five and very bald.
’Twas all for love of him I scrapped poor Jack,
And never was at home to clear old Bert.
No other’s hat or stick hung on my rack
A fortnight’s space, and yet he called me “flirt” !
He had “heard things,” he said, and we must part;
Though he might sigh for me he’d not come hack,
Oh, I loved him—maybe ’twill break my heart!
But, anyhow, I'll take it out of Jack!

HOW TO NEUTRALISE DANGEROUS
STOMACH ACIDS.
Few people besides physicians realise the
importance of keeping the food contents of
the stomach free from acid fermentation.
Healthy normal digestion cannot take place
while the delicate lining of the stomach is
being inflamed and distended by ac.d and
wind—the results of fermenting food :n the
stomach. To secure perfect diges' im. fe'j
mentation must be stopped or prevented am
the acid neutralised. For this purpose
physicians usually recommend gett.ng a
little bisurated magnesia from the chemist
and taking half a teaspoonful in a little not
or cold water immediately after eating. The}
recommend bisurated magnesia because it m
pleasant to take, has no disagreeable after-
effects. and quickly stops fermentation-
neutralises the acid and makes the sour, acid
food bland, sweet and easily digested.
The regular use of bisurated magnesia—"be
sure you get the bisurated. as other kinds o
magnesia are not so valuable —is a guarantee
of healthy, normal digestion, for it over-
comes and iirevents that acid condition which
alone is the cause of trouble, —Advt.

Two of the nine Gallipoli V.C.’s—Cap-
tain A. J. Shout, of N. S. Wales, and Lance-
corporal A. S. Burton, of Victoria—died on
the field where their honors were won. A
third, Major F. H. Tubb, of Victoria, has
now joined Burton, who has been waiting on
the Other Side for his superior officer ever
since August, 1915, when these two, with
Corporal W. J. Dunstan to help, three times
built up, under a whirlwind of Turkish
bombs, a barricade in a Lone Pine trench,
and won three treasured bits of bronze for
the 7th Battalion. Tubb, who was
36, was killed last month while being
carried .wounded out of the Menin-road
battle in Flanders. The son of a
retired State-school teacher, he was born
at Longwood, in the Kelly country of Vic-
toria. Twice wounded in' Gallipoli, he was
invalided to England and afterwards to Aus-
tralia. returning to the firing-line in France
last December. He was again invalided in
June, and was hardly in action once more
when the end came. Four of his brothers
joined the colors, and Frank won the
Military Cross at Pozieres.
Stafford Bird resigned his job as a Con-

was the Californian Isaac Mattson, who
died in Melbourne on Sept. 25 aged 04. and
was buried in the Coburg cemetery. He
was an intimate friend of Peter Lalor and
of Esmond, the gold-discoverer, one of
Lnlor’s foragers for ammunition. Mattson
was among the 12,000 miners who met on
Bakery Hill on November 29, 1854, and.
under the insurgent flag (the Southern Cross,

burned their diggers’ licenses and founded

A Bendigo constable hight Kohn has a
vague idea that an apology is due to him
from someone. He went to Melbourne in
charge of a prisoner, and on the evening of
his arrival there was an orgy of window-
smashing in the city. Kohn bogged in in
the interest o f
law’n’order. But he
was without his
halo or wings of
office, and, appar-
ently, a J. Hop in

of Education
(N.S.W.), one of
the three Ministers
on whom the hulk
of the strike work
has fallen.
Billjim is a handy man. The Society for
Promoting Christian Knowledge is printing,
in London, an edition of the Anglican
prayer-book in Wedanan, a Papuan dialect,
for missionary use. The proof-sheets were
driving the publisher’s reader dilly till Pri-
vate Norman Fettell, of the A.1.F., looked in
on leave from Flanders to see how the thing
was going. Fettell spent a good deal of his
10 days’ spell in seeing the corrections
through the press. Before he went to preach
Christianity to the Hun in the machine-gun
language which that savage »best under-
stands, Fettell was a lay-assistant in the
Anglican Mission in Papua.
Bendigo has lost its lovable old Dean
McCullagh, aged 85. Born in Dublin in
1832 he came to Australia 30 years later.
He went into the church soon afterwards—
he was trained at Moore Theological College
(N.S.W.) —and was at Lancefield for six
years. His wife’s death almost drove him
back to Ireland. But ce took hold of Ben-
digo instead and kept his pockets empty and
his hands and heart full. He wanted to see
his old home before he died ; but his friends
had to pay for the trip—he never had any
money. For 46 years lie remained at St.
Paul’s, Bendigo, retiring last year. He
missed a mitre; but his successor, G. 11.
Cranswick, was in less than two years given
an apron and a pair of gaiters to wear in
Gippsland.
Captain L. Giblin. of Tasmania, recent
winner of a Military Cross, has crammed
more experiences into 40-odd years than
most people could manage in six lifetimes.
A Tasmanian Scholar (scholarship open to
all Tasmanian boys), he took a high degree
at Cambridge, and incidentally played inter-
national football for England. Then fol-
lowed a spell in a logging camp in British
Columbia, a period as Yukon River pilot,
miner and prospector, several voyages before
the mast in sailing-ships, poultry-farming in
Tasmania, a visit to the Solomons, orchard-
ing. running a jiu-jitsu school in London
(Giblin is co-author of a standard book on
the art, and a capable exponent on the mat),
more orcharding, and election as a Labor
member in the Tas. Assembly, where he sup-
plied brains for both sides of that extra-
ordinary gathering. In his spare time he
worked out mathematical problems concern-
ing interstellate space and similar simple
matters of everyday life, and commanded the
local Intelligence Corps before the war. Gib-
lin’s scholarly stoop conceals, at first glance,
the 14st. of hard bone and muscle which he
carries with him, and a somewlmt shy and
retiring manner gives no indication to the
unwary of the extremely dirty left with
which' he is quite willing, on occasion, to
back his arguments.
“Copy Boy”: I am tipping that soon the
Inter-State Commission will have ceased
to exist. Swinburne has got tired of taking
£2OOO a year without working for it, and
has resigned; and Millen refuses to affirm
or deny a published statement that Lockyer
is to be appointed Director of Repatriation
at a salary of £2OOO. If this appointment
is made two of the Commissioners will be
disposed of and the chances are that the
third, Chief Commissioner Piddington, will
go to the High Court. Piddington was
appointed to the High Court at the same
time as Justice Power about seven years ago.
Both appointments provoked a of
criticism, and although Piddington, a K.C.,
was the better qualified of the two, he was
also the more sensitive, and resigned without
taking his seat on the. Bench. The Arbitra-
tion Court is at present overworked, and to
permit him giving more time to that part of
his job, Higgins may be relieved of his High
Court duties. An additional High Court
judge would then be required, and it seems
likely that Piddington will receive an offer.
Captain C. W. Marr, recently decorated
with a Military Cross, began with the Sub-
marine Miners’ Corps, who found amuse-
ment and experience exploding crackers in
Middle Harbor 15 years ago. Incidentally
the Corps supplied a large number of camp-
followers with cheap fish. While still an
inquisitive youth, Marr developed an inter-
est in electricity through poking about
among electrically-driven machinery in The
Bulletin office. He was then in the Gov-
ernment Stores Department, at that time
The Bulletin’s neighbor, and the back-
doors of the tjvo were very handy. Later
transferred to 'the G.P.O. engineering staff,
he was ultimately transferred as engineer-
iu-charge of Pennant Hills Wireless Station,
and from there was sent off to Mesopotamia.
Three and a half years ago Clarence T.
Collier had climbed up to the LL.B. degree
of Sydney Uni., and had thus qualified for
admission to the N. S. Wales Bar. As he
was still a legal “infant”—the first student
who had ever reached the degree so early—
he had to wait for his 21st birthday before
he could wear a wig and gown ; and in the
meantime Bill broke into Belgium. Collier
dropped his text-books and went as corporal
in Australia’s first expeditionary force, lend-
ing a hand in kicking Fritz out of New
Guinea. Returning with malaria, he was off
to France when he recovered, and there won
a lieutenant’s stars. Long reported wounded
and missing, it is now officially announced
that he was killed at Fleurbaix last year.
Dr. A. P. Merrill, for 25 years a dentist
in Collins-street, Melbourne, and for some
time vice-consul for the U.S.A. in A’ictoria,
has invented a dental machine for use under
war conditions. The toothsmith can put
the infernal machine in his coat pocket and
make his own electricity on the spot. Tne
American Government has taken it up and
the first order was for a thousand machines.

Share capital is £200,000 ; and the dividend is
equal to a shade under 6J p.c. on the share-
holders’ money in the business. But the dis-
closed total profit averages well over 8i p.c.
on the funds ; and this, while it isn’t conclu-
sive proof of anything, suggests that there
are not many dead accounts on the premises.
As a matter of fact, though at one time
there was enough noise made over the glut
of apples to suggest that William’s sub-
marines had knocked the bottom right out
of the poor little Speck, one way and an-
other the island has done remarkably well.
Any BUljim can tell you that the army lives
mostly on plum jam; and that, the high
prices for timber, the higher prices for sheep
and wool, the boom in copper and tin and
the preparations to make better use of the
island’s water power have all helped the
tourist to make Tasmania feel that things
might be worse.
So far as banks are concerned there is of
course no reason why they shouldn’t make
a good showing. The Commercial of Tas-
mania, for instance, has £470.000 of its
own funds; and, all round, that money is
worth say 1 p.c. more than it was four years
ago. And there is a fraction more to be
made out of the deposit money. On the
other hand, a tighter hand has no doubt
been kept on advances, partly because pru-
dence demands it, partly because the nation
wants every penny the banks can spare.
Hence these changes:—
1914. 1916. 1917.
Notes.. .. £5,440 £4,631 £4,512
Deposits . . 1,865,370 1,946,600 1,949,256

Advances . . 1,587,478 1,451,418 1,417,945
Premises . . 57,521 59,172 59,454
If is interesting to also compare the com-
position of the liquid assets now and at the
start of the war:—
1914. 1917.
Specie and bullion .. . . £379,221 £227,812
Australian notes . . . . . . 70,070 253,802
Public securities (inc. War Loan) 157,800 266,226
Short loans, etc. . . . . . . 91,796 220,581
Thus, though the bank has £170.000 less
out in advances than it had three years ago,
and though that money is represented
by liquid assets, all but about £30.000 not
only of that money but also of the new
deposits appears to be busy earning some-
thing. Short loans in London, for instance,
are worth 4\ p.c.
The critical time for banks will come later
on. They are crushing at present; they will
wash up then. And how they will feel about
it will depend upon the advances they are
making now and upon the titbits they are
putting by to provide for contingencies. No
man can tell where things may go ivrong.
Take, for instance, copper, in which Tas-
mania is so largely interested. Copper has
been piling up in Australia. Producers
were not permitted to export it, and the one
or two people to whom the Commonwealth
Government granted a practical monopoly
were encouraged—almost, in fact, in the cir-
cumstances compelled—to go on buying;
and there must still be considerable stocks in
the hands of smelters and refiners. Nobody
knows what will happen to the market by the
time the last of this metal reaches the other
side; for a week or so ago a cable of appar-
ently no consequence was published to the
effect that the U.S.A. Government proposed
to fix the price of copper. If Uncle Sam
does fix it the chances are he won’t fix it in
the neighborhood of £l3O. which is just
twice the normal price. “No.” Samuel is
much more likely to say, “you’ve had a very
good innings. While we weren’t in this
trouble we _ had no call to say that £l2O
wasn’t a fair thing. Now we are in it and
have to do the paying we start to take an
interest in the price. Come down a score or
so, will you?” Thus just as money was
made out of the most unexpected lines when
the war started, so money may be dropped
on the most unexpected lines when the war
stops, or even before. And that is going to
be the testing time for the banks.

The progress of this co. is a striking example
of what can be done by co-operative effort.
When the A'ic. Workers’ Compensation Act
came into operation four years ago, manu-
facturers launched this co. chiefly to carry
their risks under that Act, but also to do
marine, burglary, plate-glass, personal acci-
dent and sickness insurance. With the
Chamber behind it, the co. got most ojf its
business without canvass. In the, two
years and nine months it has; been
writing business, premiums at tariff rates
have totalled £104,759; and the cost has
been only £9483, including taxation and the
amount written off furniture. So on gross
premiums the expense rate is a wonderfully
low 9 p.c. Even if the rate be calculated
on premiums after all discounts and bonuses
are deducted, it is only 12 p.c. Meantime,
the co. has got off fairly lightly so far as
losses are concerned. Claims to date total
£30,405, or 29 p.c. of gross premiums.
Protection for the policy-holder is more
than ample. The general rule is to reserve
40 p.c. of the year’s premiums for unexpired
risks, and this co. has set aside just over
47 p.c. From the shareholders’ point of
view; everything in the garden is blooming.
Capital is £30,000. and apart from the
£20,380 which has been reserved for unex-
pired risks, outstanding claims and all other
liabilities amount to only £7728. With the
exception of £250 of otnce furniture the whole
of the £72.897 of assets is liquid. The co.
holds £24,000 of War Loan and an equal
amount in State securities.
Altogether, the record is remarkable. To
shareholders the co. has paid a dividend of 10
p.c. p.a. from its inception ; on workers’ com-
pensation business discounts and bonuses
amount to 35 p.c. p.a. (equivalent to a free
year’s insurance in every three) ; on marine
premiums, 10 p.c.; and on all other business,
20 p.c. In May this year a fire branch was
established, and the directors report that it
is “developing satisfactorily.” Motor-car
insurance is a side-line. The co. is doing a
fine service-by demonstrating wdiat co-opera-
tion plus good management means. And it
is a lesson the nation is sorely in need of.
lor it means cutting out unproductive labor
and making it available for jobs that will
add to the wealth of the country. Hitherto,
when the exactions of the parasite got over
the odds, the tendency in Australia has been
to cry to the State. Unfortunately the
result has been sadly disappointing in most
cases; for it has meant appealing to the
politicians, who as a class are about the last
people likely to make a business success of
anything.

Taking it all round, the co. had a satisfac-
tory half-year. Partly, no doubt, because of
mgh prices, the turnover was the largest for
any “off” season; and the upward rush of
exes, in proportion to receipts was at last
checked. This table shows that aspect of
the business :—•

The capital remains at an insignificant
£27,783. in £1 shares, which are in the hands
of no less than 9530 holders; for it takes
only one share to entitle the customer to the
10 p.c. bonus on purchases. That the co. can
carry on so large a business on so small a
capital, and still owe less than £40,000. is
due to (1) the reserves, which have now
reached nearly double the capital; (2) the
fact that the co. has nothing locked up in
freeholds, though it has £15.439 in lease-
holds (which it is steadily writing off) ; and
(3) the fact that as at July 31 its book
debts were only £10,341. Selling almost
wholly for spot cash it is, able to buy for
cash, and its discounts alone during the half-
year were worth £1789. Further, having no
book debts to speak of, it is able to carry a
stock of £79,239 —rather more than the total
of the capital and reserves. But whether the
co-operative trader gets as much benefit as
he ought to is a matter over which there is
room for two opinions. He gets rather less
than 4 p.c. on his capital and reserves com-
bined ; and though nominally he gets a hand-
some 10 p.c. rebate on his cash trade, it is
probable that the gross prices are on the
whole higher than those of ordinary traders.
Even if they are not, £lO,OOO would be by
no means a large profit to show on such a
turnover, remembering that most of the
trade comes in without expensive solicita-
tion, that there are no heavy book-keeping
charges and no costs of collection and no
bad debts worth mentioning. If, on the other
hand, the £lO,OOO is only shown by marking
up prices, then the financial results are quite
unsatisfactory, and these 10,000 co-operators
are not getting the benefit out of co-opera-
tion that they ought to.

The profit for the year is made up of
£18,946 from trading, £5593 “balance of
claim against Dixson Trust. Ltd., after pro-
viding for concrete damages and costs.” and
an unexplained £l2 that has fallen into the
contingency account. This contingency
account, which in former years included em-
ployees’ insurance fund, is part of the
reserves shown in the table: formal reserve
fund, £30,000; contingency account, £3500:
unappropriated profits, £8592. The co. lias
had a succession of misfortunes. Just after
the 7 p.c. prefs. had been sold and before
they were issued the premises, then under
alteration, partially collapsed; and the
fight over the liability of the landlord, the
Dixson Trust, was taken right up to the
Privy Council. The co. won ; and after pay-
ing for concrete damages and costs, it had
£5093 to solace it for loss of profits,
sleep,. etc. Hence, in addition to a 10
p.c. div., a Jjonus of Is. per share, making
altogether 15 p.c,, is paid to ordinaries for
the past year. Probably to simplify the
settlement and end the connection, the" Dix-
son Trust agreed to sell the premises “at a
fair and reasonable valuation and upon
most satisfactory terms.” So. instead of
the item “Leaseholds, £15.828,” in the 1916
we now have “Freehold and lease-
holds, £i 4,620,” so that the new property
stands the co. in at about £60,000. On the
other side “Sundry creditors, acceptances
mortgages and bankers, £141,758,” has taken
the place of ‘ Sundry creditors, acceptances
and bankers, £73.626.” Liabilities of all
descriptions are £146.203 as against £75.076
a P °f 171.127. The capital remains
at £lo,< ~J)o—-£30,000 6 p.c. first cumulative
prefs., £52.500 second (7 p.c.) cumulative
prefs. and £75,000 ordinaries.
No doubt the profits for the year and the
general prospects of the co. have been im-
proved by the purchase in January of the
furniture business of David Jones, Ltd
next door. The business that these two
catered for was too much alike. In a big
city it is an advantage to the traders
themselves to have a drapers’ block
and a street whose name gets itself associ-
ated in the public mind with jewellery • but
there is no advantage in having two shops
alongside one another selling the same or
practically the same kind of pots and pans
—anyway there is no advantage to the shop-
keepers. But it is an advantage to people
doing the kind of business that Beard Wat-
son s do to be alongside a business doing a
David Jones trade; so the purchase of the
premises may be reckoned a good thing
especially as the co. has a pref. capital that
doesn t expect 10 p.c. The purchase has of
course, piled up the liabilities; and later on
it may not be a bad thing to issue snm
more .capital—there is another £ 4 -S
authorised. The alternative is to stack o
reserves; and that means, or ought to l?
increasing the dividend to correspond ,
to That? no "'" tlas ' S » Practical objection
The co. has certainly done well enough
during the year to earn comrratnWm,

£181,229, as compared with £155301 '

that the stock-sheets show a lot of S
at war prices; and there is obvious danger
lv. t l,S^, da , nSer fl '°T a P slump.
Mliat will happen when peace comes (an
we are not likely to get much notice of its
coming) is very uncertain. There will for
some years be a shortage of shipping ■ and a
lot of what shipping there is will be busv
repatriating troops. But three things have
to be taken into account: (1) the troopshms
will carry cargo, too; (2) our stored-un
wheat will be wanted, and probably more
than our proportion of ships will be hurried
this way; and (3) in some lines at anv
rate there will probably be a competition to
get rid of war-time stocks before the Greater
slump comes. And, though we may f ee l
pretty good for a while after the awful
nightmare ends, it won’t be long before we
shall feel quite different, which will only
intensify the anxiety to get out.

The least the directors could do after
the annual meeting was to drink the
health of the State Ministry; for Ryan
reckoned Bananaland could do its bit towards
winning the war without six o’clock closing,
and though brollies were waved he refused
to turn off the tap. So this co. has not suf-
fered from the trading restrictions which
have the southern beer-dealer. Tax-
ation and increased cost of production, how-
ever, have cut into profits somewhat:—

After the financial riot of Queensland’s
old boom days, this co. spent many years—
right down, in fact, to 1912—nursing its
wounds. In 1902, as the realisation of the
boom assets proceeded, the 255. shares were
written down to 12s Gd. Apparently that
did not put things in order; and during the
next 10 years portion of the profits had to
go into the sink. Here is the history of the
co. since the time just prior to the clean-up:

>So in 10 years the co. has got in hand £l3lO
of new capital, and all other liabilities (less
in each case) have been increased by
£•14.303. Meantime £38,902 lias been added
to premises, plant, etc., £8216 to hotel pro-
perties, and £39,667 to stock and book debts.
S°, always provided sufficient lias been writ-
ten off to cover depreciation and provide for
contingencies, the co. is £51.172 better off
than it was 10 years ago. In other words,
besides paying an average 74 p.c. it has put
by an average 64 p.c.
As to the future there’s no telling. Though
Bung s trading hours have not been dis-
turbed by the State Government in Banana-
land, everything is not going his way. Only
the other day, as the result of a local option
poll, the Licensing Court closed two pubs
in one electorate. And on results to date
the Government’s elaborate £17,500 beer-
siiop at Babinda is only helping to provide
ammunition for the no-liquor party. The
Byan Government went to an area mois-

Have you installed a G.E. Voltage Regulator on
your system? If not, by doing so you can reduce
your operating expenses, because a single regulator
will control satisfactorily all the generators and
exciters in the station when operating in parallel,
thus not only decreasing your staff and reducing
your wage bill, but also increasing your output
whilst lessening pyour expenditure. Write us for

Follow the lead of experienced men. Alumino-
ferric is used by the N.S.W. Public Works Department,
Sydney Metropolitan, Newcastle and Hunter River
Water Boards, Ardlethan Mines, graziers, etc., for
precipitating impurities and clarifying water in
reservoirs, dams, etc. One pound clarifies 2000/3000
gallons of the most turbid water within three hours.
Jt is exceedingly cheap, and harmless for either
drinking or boiler water, and is used throughout
Australia. Water is a valuable asset in summer

The latest copper-smelting plant to be erected in
Australia is that of the Mount Cuthbert. Company
in North Queensland. It consists of buildings, power-
plant with boilers, generating sets and blowers,
blast furnace, copper converters and converter re-
fining plant, blister gathering and cleaning shed,
also steel bins for ore and coke. Wherever possible
the plant is electrically driven. The whole of the
plant was supplied by the Austral Otis Engineering

Pioneer Wood Pipe, the logical pipe for water
systems, has greater carrying capacity, is easier to
handle and to lay, is lighter and saves cost in
freight, costs from 25 per cent, to 60 per cent, less
than metal pipes, and is the cleanest pipe for convey-

This is a bad enough record of labor
troubles to make the worker think. In the
co.’s very first year the mine was idle from
October 16 to March 14, but the cost of
maintenance went on. Meantime some of
the market that had been got (and it costs
money to find markets) was lost. In the
second year, consequently, the sales were in-
termittent, and profits made in one fortnight
disappeared in the next. In the third year
“very many short stoppages” occurred. In
the fourth year it was decided that the mine
had reached a stage when the coal could be
won by hand—previously it had been won
by electric coal-cutters. The question of a
suitable rate for hand-getting thus arose,
and men were put on to pick-work to deter-
mine what average quantity could be got
per day. Naturally, this being in the
nature of a test, the co. proceeded to super-
vise the job. The miners objected, went out
on strike on March 11, and did not resume
till December 1, Judge Edmunds having
meantime tackled the job of fixing a price.
After this long break a market had to be
built up again; so “the management was
unable to realise anticipations of substanti-
ally increasing the output, without which in-
crease revenue is only about sufficient to
pay waggon hire and interest after provid-
ing for working and other costs.” In the
following year to June 30, 1916, “produc-
tion was very much interfered with through-
out by small strikes and arbitrary stoppages
of work”; and last year “because of the
November strike and minor strikes and stop-
pages” the mine w.as “able to produce coal
on 221| days. This reduced the possible
output to such an extent that we were
unable to supply our contract require-
ments.” What has hannened since June 30
it isn’t necessary to mention here.
And that’s how it stands. The share capi-
tal is £35,946, the debenture debt £25,815
and bank and other creditors £11,256. The
shareholders haven’t had a penny in eight
years; but meantime about £295,000 worth
of coal has been taken out of their mine. ' As
against that extraction of coal, all the
benefit that the shareholders have got is that
the mine has been more or less opened up.
The equipment has mostly been done with
the debentures above mentioned. As to the
future, what is the use of guessing? Plainly
it depends upon the coal-miner. And the
coal-miner’s present mental attitude is past
understanding.

Municipal electrical competition has cast a
shadow over this co. since the middle of
1914; and now increased costs are adding to
its troubles. Of the profit for the past half-
year shown above £BO has been transferred
to a plant renewal account, so, if that is a
fair set-off against current wear and tear
not otherwise provided for, the 8 p.c. divi-
dend has barely been earned. The surplus
of liquid assets over liabilities at June 30
was £4944, or £827 more than it was a year
ago and £B3 more than at December last.

The N. S. Wales Railways Superannua-
tion scheme, to which this paper gave some
attention two years ago, continues to be a
disgrace to the people who were responsible
for it. During the past year (to June 30)
£76,625 was deducted from salaries, under
the provisions of the rotten Act passed by
the Wade Government seven years ago, and
no less than £95,206 was paid out, apart
from the cost of maintaining insurance poli-
cies transferred to the Board. The balance
to the credit of the fund has disappeared in
this alarming fashion during the last four
years:—
1914 .. £51,674 I 1916 .. £26,900
1915 . . 42,928 | 1917 . . 13,581
If the Fund shrinks as much during the cur-
rent year as it has done, on the average,
during the last two years, it will then be
bankrupt, except for a special £30,000 wdiich
has just been taken out of the pockets of
the general public. The railway servants
are required to pay only 1| p.c. of their
salaries into the Fund; and the contribu-
tion is ridiculously small. The whole thing
amounts, in fact, to plain robbery of the
public, which .has to make good the inevit-
able deficiency.

At Hill End (N.S.W.) the strike has held
up supplies, and hands have had to be
reduced. The Hawkins Hill Reward con-
tinues to display [most liveliness. The
Amalgamated Hill End is practically idle,
only two miners being on the premises.
Abercrombie copper mines, Burraga
(N.S.W.), have got another move on after
a several weeks’ hold-up due to the fuel
shortage. Sufficient supplies have been
drawn to two of the furnaces to
light up, and the third should be busy
shortly. McMahon, chairman of the Lon-
don Board, has just inspected the property
before cutting back Europewards, and the
arrangements come to wall probably result
in serene sailing for a while.
* * * *
Carpathia tin (N.S.W.) still has legal and
metallurgical worries, and until the appeal
to the Full Court over the White Crystal
squabble is decided the Board is wise in
holding on to a substantial balance of
slightly over £2OOO after paying the six-
penny div. The profit for six months ended
July 31 was £4815 from 2227 tons ore and
152 tons old mill residues. The mill treated
1902 tons for 104 tons of concentrates, show-
ing a recovery of 70.7 p.c.

This last “sympathetic” strike and a
paltry profit of £179 for the half-year looks
like trouble at Jumbunna, Gippsland. The
output was 12,800 tons, out of which the
co. gets nothing vffiatever; and shareholders
are crusty at feeding miners and directors
for nothing. The directors know that a few
are responsible, hence 1 > they won’t submit
to the men’s demand that they shall be taken
back as a body. - So an extraordinary meet-
ing is to have “a proposition” put in front
of it. What seems likely is that the Board
will vote for free labor. If so secretary
Wimpney’s heart will do a dozen leaps, as
he is hungering for a real John Brown fight
with the South Gippsland union mis-leaders.
* * * *
Ajax Central, Daylesford (Vic.), is on
the call-list. The bit of gold in the stopes
and the cash reserve have been used up to
sink to 1500 ft. This is to see if the barren
zone below 900 ft. passes out at the greater
depth. A good spell of call-making for
crosscutting and driving levels is ahead,
and as a lucky hit would lift Daylesford
mining out of the gutter, the other Ajax
cos. ought to subsidise the Central in its
deep work.
* * * *
Duke Extended, Maryborough (Vic.), has
mopped up £75.000 of Australian and about
twice that much English money. According
to George Bryant a lot of this could have
been saved if the tip of the old ’uns had
been taken to scout for a split in the gutter.
Of course he doesn’t put it that way exactly,
but it is about what he means. What luck
Bryant has! He dropped on to Cathcarts
after Bewick-Moreing’s London people had
forfeited their 30,000 shares rather than
pay a 3d. call and saw shares up to £6.
Then he dropped into Langi South with
things anyhow, and shares floated up to 16s.
Now he happens along to Duke Extended
with shares at 6d., and away they flutter to
half a quid. Well, if it’s not luck it’s judg-
ment. Whatever it is, it means a sure crust
for Peacock’s office.
Interested people are booming Tuckabi-
anna (W.A.), and declare it the most im-
portant gold find made in the West since
Ivalgoorlie. Reputable cold-blooded experts
who have been there, however, say that it is
a place of short shoots. The Golden Butter-
fly has an option there, the Hansel Mundy
(alias Chaffinch) is nibbling at another, and
several more have the field in view as a
means of making a recovery. The public,
however, had better insist on getting official
reports backed by some expert of standing
before throwing any money in.
* * * *
New Boddington (W.A.) has come to
earth at last. The directors’ report for the
half-year ended June 30 admits that develop-
ments in the lower levels have been “some-
what disappointing” and that all the co. has
to build on is the possibility of development
now in progress turning up trumps. No men-
tion whatever is made of ore reserves. The
accounts show cash in hand £1076 and lia-
bilities £874.

Peacock, Staughton, Armytage and party
have formed a co. in Melbourne known as
the Tyrconnel South, and taken up a 27-acre
lease adjoining the Tyrconnel North’s hold-
ing at Mt. Varden, in the Laverton district
(W.A.). The reef in the show is stated to
have been proved for 20 chains to be 6ft.
wide and to be worth lOdwt. One advantage
it possesses is that it is well off the beaten
track of touts, and may therefore be able to
keep the public in ignorance of its real value
until the battery speaks.
Boulder No. 1 (W.A.) just-issued yearly
statement shows a debit balance of £1419.
The co.’s old lease at Boulder is still being
rooted by tributors, who last year paid £46
in royalty. No discovery was made of suffi-
cient importance to justify the co. resuming
work on its own account, and probably never
will. Several new shows were examined
during the year, but all were turned down.

Owing to lean times, Bullfinch and Boul-
der directors did not draw any fees last
year; but those of Lake View and Star, which
suffered even more, pocketed £650 and dis-
tributed an additional £ll6 among those
who form what is known as the Technical
Committee. A further £6OO was also paid
to a London firm of consulting engineers for
looking into things. Seeing that the co.
has a manager, with 8., M. and Co. nomi-
nally acting as general managers, and that
it is working at a loss, it is a wonder share-
holders do not kick.
Bullfinch Proprietary (W.A.), according
to chairman G. P. Doolette, still has a
future; in which case the age of miracles
has not passed. It is not intended to sink
the main shaft any further at present, but
some winning is to be done in the best part
of the northern-series lode below 510 ft. As
regards output, the manager hopes to keep
it in the region of 5000 tons for the present
year at least.

Shareholders in Mount Molloy, the North
Queensland copper show which has been in
the liquidators’ hands for a long time, are
still waiting for a distribution. The
Queensland Government took over the co.’s
railway for a mere song and paid with
Treasury Bills which don’t fall due for
sotnething like 10 years. So far a pur-
chaser has not been found for the smelters
and plant, on the sale of which any early
distribution depends. In any case, should
it be decided that the prefs. rank first for
return of capital, ordinaries need not expect
anything.

When Bowes Kelly opened up on Mt.
Lyell’s plans for the electrolytic treatment
of the Read-Rosebery zinc-lead ores he
said that eventually 50,000 h.p. would be
wanted for the job. According to Huntley
Clarke, who surveyed the handy little Lake
Margaret scheme for the co., nearly that
much can be got from the King River Gorge.
The Speck’s Government has set the Public
Works Committee inquiring into the pro-
posal that it should build the station and
supply the power to the new Read-Rosebery
Co. Huntley-told the committee that 45,000
h.p. from the King was a sure thing. He
had gone to look for 30,000 h.p. and found
half as much again. It is likely that the
Government will go into the business if and
when it can raise the wind and sees a chance
of getting the machinery.
Some lively gambling in Coronet Hill
(N.T.) shares seems to have been checked
by the chairman’s statement at last week’s
meeting of the co. Coronet Hill is a pos-
sible, even a probable, copper-cwm-silver
mine of magnitude, and further development
with Government assistance is now assured ;
but the spec, is no “dead bird.” Nothing
has happened on the ground since the shares
that were friendless at £5 rose to £35 and
dropped to £22 or thereabouts.
* * * *
South Bischoff (Tas.) has obtained per-
mission from the Treasurer to increase its
capital from £l2OO in £lO shares to £16,000
in £1 shares. Shareholders on the old regis-
ter take 11,700 paids, leaving 4300 contribs.
to be issued to the public. It isn’t much to
equip and develop a mine on. Prospecting
on the surface has revealed some fine tin
values ahead of the drive; but the workings
are too shallow to reveal the future.
* * * *
Including the sixpenny (£3750) just paid,
Tongkah Compound has given its share-
holders £163,750, all earned by one dredge—
surely a world’s record.

Corella Copper (Q.) is to be given happy
despatch. Three contributory causes are
recited by Melbourne secretary Shackell,
though the first two can be rolled into one,
viz., not enough ore to run the smelter con-
tinuously. The other is the ever-present
labor problem. Liquid assets tot up to
£10,533, comprising copper and stores. The
co. owes the moneylender £7306 and sundry
creditors £lllO, leaving a surplus of £2117.
Then there is plant and machinery, whose
value depends entirely upon the uncertain
demand.

LETTER
DAVID
JONES

SMART
MILLINERY
Sydney, Octobek 1, 1917.
My Dear Arini, —
The summer girl had her own way at
Randwick both for the opening day and the
holiday. It w T as just the weather for the
airy rags that are lovely—anyhow, until
they meet the Monday tub. The crowd was
up to that of pre-war days, and Saturday’s
crush rushed for its seats when the saddling
bell rang. Some of it, of course, was glued
to the Tote House windows —a hundred or
so, in a panting queue. There’s a promise
of swifter methods at the next A.J.C. meet-
ing. A snail is the only animal who could
compete with Saturday’s handling of the
small tote-fry.
Chintz—yes, just the same as grandma
chose when she had her sofa measured for a
new dress —is the rage. It is a shrieking
kind of fashion, for the lady who upholsters
her spring frock in cretonne is liable to look
the width of an armchair. But there it is—
fruit as large as life, and flowers to match,
stamped on the back of the chintz-trimmed
damsel. Barbara Gordon had one of the
new white smocks to soften her plunge into
the flowery way. Mrs. Leslie Walford kept
the new craze off with soft silky-white drap-
ery and a shepherdess hat. This kind of
millinery has long Bo Peep loops of ribbon.
Mrs. Keogh, the Coonamble lady who rarely
misses our big meets, was in pale biscuit-
tinted rigout, smart and summery. Pale
pink girls and dove-like drapery floated up
and down the lawn, with an occasional
Reckitt’s-blue girl, like Vera Pearce, to hit
it up. Mrs. A. E. Hughes, in a delicate
shade of canary—the pale tint that hides
under the warbler’s wing—was It, so far as
the canary brigade was concerned. For the
ordinary blatant orange-yellow that blazed
in the sun is too fierce to live with on a
summer day.
The Rajah and his fair-haired lady, with
her sister in attendance, were in the mem-
bers’ stand for one or two of the big races.
Her Serenity -wore a hat that turned up like
a bishop’s Sunday millinery.
Rupert Clarke is over from Melbourne.
The Norman Nivisons of Walcha —ever faith-
ful to the gee-gee, though the polo ponies are
at grass—are in town. The Jim McMasters
(Mrs. Jim in the latest frocking), Mrs. James
Gordon, a few Osbornes (Mrs. Val in blush-
pink), the Morton girls with the Coolan-
gatta Hays. Mrs. Leslie Macdonald in the
black-and-white stripes that grow wider
every season, some of the Melbourne Mac-
kinnons, and a heap of local Knoxes were in
the pens.
Hats this Spring turn down in front,
generally speaking, and kick up behind.
They’re nice shady little verandahs for
sunny days.
H. G. White, of Belltrees, is in town for
the carnival. The Fred McMasters came
from up-country for the same show. There’s
a Bathurst McPhillam.v or two in the city
on similar pleasure bent.
Navy-blue is a steady goer at every big
dress parade, and one of the neatest in this
old favorite color was worn bv Mrs. N.
Nivison. It has the 1917 embroidery that
throws on an apple or an orange or a big
tulip as a relief. The old-old-fashioned
braid embroidery—very narrow—that fond
mothers used to patiently stitch on their
kiddies’ best frocks is the latest device on
adult finery.
War Chest Day was blazing hot, with soft
patches of melting tar on the side-paths. The
curious made an early trek to the Domain
to see the floral cars line up, but the show
wasn’t up to France’s Day standard. An
amiable donkey jogging along while the
orange cart behind him jolted the lady driver
like an india-rubber ball was one of the
features. The waratah has been this
year’s super-flower, and a big car decorated
with great red blooms was a brilliant splash
of color. The Hayseed family—the Queens-
land squatting Johnstons—repeated their
France’s Day effort, and caught the judge’s
eye. “Melody Maids,” in a huge Toohey’s
lorry, and Mrs. Lincoln Jones, in a chaise
abloom with lilies, were in the prize-list.
In Moore-street the American-Australian
Leaguers—Mrs. Brittain president—claimed
and got applause for their ultra-fine needle-
work. Their big stall showed, besides, a
display of home-made confectionery which
kept the Young Idea frankly insolvent. Mrs.
W. J. Allen, the Canadian lady who looks
like one of Florence Rodway’s miniatures,
and little Mrs. Winn were toilers in this big
tent.
The Commercial Travellers’ stall —one of
the big financial successes on previous Days
—had garden blooms that appealed to
romantic souls. But Mrs. A. M. Graham
and Mrs. Spencer also pushed a juicy line of
pork sausages that sent Mrs. Suburbs home
laden with the morrow’s breakfast. Mrs.
Vernon, in charge of the Ist Light Horse,
was lower down the road. The War Chest
refreshment tent was chock-a-block with
thirsty souls long before the surrounding
scenery in Martin Place was like an ant-bed.
Just before noon it was hurriedly remem-
bered that the day which had opened itself
at sunrise had to be officially blessed by the
Deputy-Governor. Then a great squeeze
began. Over the tops of a sea of millinery
one got a scrambled vision of the Cullens,
H. Y. Braddon and Mrs. Walker. The band
blared the National Anthem, and the little
crowd on the dais made way for the cork-
screw 7 oratory.
In the Australia the moans of the protest-
ing male as beauteous damsels robbed him
rose above the din. In the newly-extended
winter garden—the Australia has also a
new top-floor, de luxe edition —Mrs. Mulli-
gan mothered a cafe chantant. Evelyn Scot-
ney, in a grey dream surmounted by a com-
pressed blue and azure feather toque, war-
bled while that part of the company which
had to stand on its aching feet shuffled
uneasily round the tea-tables.
Ross Gore w T as hon. organiser of the Day.
But the Battalion Comforts dames took
over a heap of the worry, and there’s likely
to be £lOO,OOO more in the Christmas tucker
for Australia at the Front.
One industry is already on its feet as a
result of these cheerful robberies-under-
arms. That is sw r eet-making. Before the
war it was done in a comparatively small
way in this hamlet. Nearly everybody
munched the imported chocolate. Now the
chocolate can’t travel, and Our Girls are
becoming artists in icing. Even the Ameri-
cans, who are top-notchers at candy et cie,
admit the skill of the local lass when she
handles a sugar-bag.
One of the War Chest plums was the
freak museum in Moor e-street, with Joynton
Smith, hat gaily tilted over one ear, as the
show r man. He hung over a yard or so of
verandah and held forth with such eloquence
that the crowd almost fought to pay its way
inside the booth.
The Amelioration
Committee, having
turned an X ray
glance on to the
hand-woven tweed
industry for parti-
ally-disabled soldiers,
now pronounces its
blessing. “To date.”
says one of the
executive, “it’s about
the most practical
wage-earning scheme
for the returned man
who isn’t strong
enough to get back
to heavy outdoor
work.” Some weeks
ago Sergeant
Sinclair, of the Vic.
State War Council, came over here. His
youthful pupil, Sergeant McDowell, inva-
lided home not so long ago, was his mate.
“Here’s an Australian lad who had never
seen a hand-loom in his life,” said the enthu-
siastic Scot, “till lie started with me at
Geelong. He picked up the work in an in-
credibly short time, and is now a competent
instructor.” Under the Red Cross wing,
with young McDowell in charge, the hand-
looms are gradually getting into action in
Lawson House, Clarence-street. Sinclair
learnt the trade at Glasgie (Harry Lauder
was once a weaver thereabouts) and thence
migrated to Invercargill (M.L.) where he
held on his Tam o’ Shanter while he per-
suaded the windy town to buy his home-made
blankets. Here’s Judith Fletcher’s picture
of the pioneer.
First night at the Criterion—the play was
the mythical “General John Regan”—
brought our Best People’s cars into Pitt-
street. The herd had the chastening reflec-
tion that it could either walk home (our
trams retire from business at 10 p.m.) or
go forth and look for something expensive
on wheels. Cyril Maude, the affable, light-
hearted Dr. O’Grady of the plot, is still
Grumpyish, in a short-of-breath diction
which stabbed with pauses his neat little
speech at the finish. The scene-painter,
whose name is not visible on the pro-
gramme, is the hero of the first act.
Dr. Stewart McKay, in a box, had with
him Mrs. Phil Morton (in black with her
hair heaped high up) and Mrs. Hugh Gor-
don in a rosebud wreath and suitable sar-
torial trimmings. The usual first-nighters in
the stalls clung to their limited chair space.
Being mostly portly they have to sit up
straight so as to keep in their scheduled 14in.
of upholstered seat. The Budukotas sat
meekly in the d.c., which is getting back its
temporarily-lost air of fashion. Mrs. St.
George’s picturesque white coiffure loomed
in the same row. Dr. Larkins brought his
blue-eyed Best Girl in a heavenly eau-de-nil
gown. Dr. Lipscombe and his lady were
next door. The Reggie Allens sat in the
centre of the horseshoe —the place whence
you can see how the older beaux in the
stalls part their hair.
The Art Society had a conversazione in
the Education Gallery the other night. The
Department’s new eyrie for art-shows is
rather more hideous by night than by day,
and the mulberry walls are a sickly night-
mare by the hard artificial white light that
beats from the roof. There’s an exhibition
of pictures, of course, to divert the atten-
tion of lovely woman who takes her evening-
out at anything so solemn as a conversaz.
President Lister, hon. sec. Oxnard Smith
and hon. treas. Hadfield, with symbolical
easels (a little smaller than cheese-plates)
affixed to their buttonholes, welcomed the
tramp of the incoming boots.
An old call-boy went to dwell amongst the
eternal stars when W. T. Pullen died the
other day at Woolgoolga. He knocked and
bawled at the old Victoria Theatre in Syd-
ney in the time of Vincent Wallace (com-
poser of “Maritana”), Madame Carandini
and G. V. Brooke. In ’B2 he went to Wool-
goolga and established the sugar industry
there. Unluckily it was a frost.
The Vagabonds are going to be responsible
for a patriotic hold-up for five nights. The
Bush Book Club also expects a few crumbs
from the show. On October 11 the 2nd
D.A.C. and 22nd Howitzer dames collect the
profits. St. James’s Hall is the place;
Pinero’s “The Magistrate” the lure.
A year or so ago there was a Government
scheme to catch the British immigrant
young, meet her on the Sydney wharf, and
bustle her off to a Home from Home. There,
at breezy Bondi, she was to be taught how
to do the stairs without undoing the
carpet. It was even considered possible that
a sister of Mrs. Holman’s might be induced
to preside over this Elysium for young maid-
servants in the making. Scarba, which used
to belong to the Loewenthals, and was for
years the home of James Edmond, was dedi-
cated to the cause of the properly-grilled chop.
But the dream melted before the blaze of
war, and the Benevolent Society has stepped
in. As Welfare House it was christened by
Mrs. George Puller the other day. Neville
Mayman, president of the centenarian
society, explained the useful purpose of this
newest shelter for homeless women and chil-
dren.
Alfred Hill’s quintet, “Life,” was heard
again in the Conservatorium the other night.
Verbrugghen calls the thing “a work of in-
trinsic art,” and he’s not the man to pour
melted butter down the wrong back. Myrtle
Meggy provided the musical tinkle of a
grand to thread the pearls supplied by the
Verbrugghen quartet.
Sydney ’Varsity honor-roll is something to
be proud of. To the end of last month
graduates had gained 23 D.S.O.’s, 65 Mili-
tary Crosses, one D.C.M., three Military
Medals, seven French War Crosses, and one
each of the Russian Order of St. Stanislaus,
the Servian Red Cross, the Montenegrin
Red Cross and Order of Danilo, and the
Chevalier Cross of the Legion of Honor.
Also, three C.M.G.’s and one Order of the
Bath have a place in the list. Others, of
course, have done well; but their turn for
decoration hasn’t come yet.
The War Chest notion of giving young-
sters donkey rides through Hyde Park has
possibilities in it. At a penny there and
back the big main avenue in the park
could be exploited on Saturday afternoons,
and hard-up Comforts Funds might get the
profits. Miss Wearne, who was in charge
of the Public Service women’s spirited vil-
lage at Queen’s Square, ran the donkey for
all he was worth. Bhe may be able to see
even more money in the game next time.
Save your old bones! Manufacturers will
be prepared to take them off your hands in
the near future. Also, catch the humble
sardine-tin and snatch the ripped salmon-
can from the garbage-box. The Women's
National Economy Exhibition manager,
Grace Burrows, will tell you why. There’s
to be a series of demonstrations at this show
in November. Did you know that for years
oefore the war German agents in this "town
(and in many others) made much good
money out of our canned food? You ate
what was in the can. They collected the
metal,_ and off to Kaiserland it went, to re-
turn in the cheap ware that used to han<*
ou the kitchen wall. The German toy sol-
• er j j hundred thousand strong—that once
invaded the Commonwealth at Christmas
wa ?. y®ur sardine-tin in a former existence
as likely as not.
There’s a queer fish in the Harbor. In the
old days the liners came to us as big masses
ui: black or huge areas of white. Then fh ß
German guns began to bark, and in nrbter
live mimicry the ships were all turned m
grey But a big grey mass is still a good
target as it heaves about on the skyline - so
another plan has been adopted—the camm,
flage. Give a cubist half a ton of “S'
grey and red and black, and tell him to
paint the ship boldly with his idea of A Wet
Night, and you would have something like
the fantastic thing that this big newcomer
is.
The Deanery in the shadow of St
Andrew’s is now clean-shaved. Gone are
the thick green whiskers that hung about
its face in the days when the late esteemed
Cowper lived there. Since then it has been
a clerical Johnny-all-sorts place, with
offices in its front parlors. The imported
young man who was jumped into the loiw-
vacant gaiters lives in fashionable flats, and
does not worry a bone on the mat of the
Trades Hall. The ancient residence, since
its shave, has been added to, and was lately
rechristened the Diocesan Church House. ’
This scholarly head,
which came out of
Judith Fletcher’s
camera last week,
belongs to artist
Sidney Cocks, the
most inarticulate
brush-man in the
State. The scribe
who can get an in-
terview out of him
will have to follow
his easel and lie in
wait on some lone
crag up o n our Blue
hills. For months
his foot never hits a
city pavement. When
it does it is a fleet-
ing rap, and the
owner’s mind ie
speeding it up to eateli the first mountain
train. From a business point of view he
is impossible. Yet that sure judge, late
manager Gillett, of Anthony Hordern’s, was
so impressed with the beauty of Cocks’s best
work (he paints pot-boilers, of course, like
the rest of his craft) that he insisted on his
having a one-man show in the firm’s big
gallery last December.
Years ago, when Hilder was in knicker-
bockers, Cocks was wandering over Europe
painting in the soft wraith-like impressions
now associated with tho much younger
artist’s name. The older man has beec
slighted by the trustees of the National
Gallery just as was the younger water-
colorist in his life. Therefore the present
show of Cocks’s pictures in Aldenhoven’s
gallery (Hunter-street) is innocent of any
label “Bought for the National Gallery.”
Yet Ileysen can tell of the enthusiasm which
this artist’s pictures created in Adelaide.
The friend of Fullwood, Streeton and
Conder in the long ago, Cocks tried the chief
art schools of London as a prospective
water-color student. But—“ You don’t want
teaching,” they said. With that he humbly
sat at the feet of Turner, spending every
morn ng studying the English artist’s
methods. Then on to France, Italy and
Egypt. After many years’ absence, Cocks
returned to Australia a while ago. When
he is dead he will be hung on the walls of
our own big Gallery.
It’s bad luck for the Evelyn Scotney-
Iloward White team to have hit the tail of
the tram strike. The present early-to-roost
habits of the uncertain rolling stock keep
the more distant travellers at hofne. How-
ever, the Tait management bustles the pro-
gramme to a finish sharp on the stroke of
10. .John Annul io is behind the flute, and
Harold Elvins in front of the piano.
There’s to be a sale of work on behalf of
the 10th Battalion Comforts Fund at 15
Bligh-street on Thursday and Friday of this
week. Very beautiful hand-made cobwebs
some of it is.
What did old gentlemen of the Peter
Teazle era do with their waistcoats when
they sat down? Sydney doesn’t know,
because Cyril Maude who wears one —it’s
brocade and comes nearly to the knees—
stands up throughout the only fragment in
which we’ve had him, the Screen scene.
Yours affectionately,
VANDORIAN.

Melbourne, October 1, 1917.
Mr Dear Yarrie.—
Governor Stanley went out and opened
the Show on Wednesday; his lady partner
looked at the weather and gave the job best.
Genthelp Conant, in red-streak khaki, had
goloshes and an umbrella in reserve for his
boss; but no goloshes or umbrella could save
the boss from the shower of criticism that
fell next day. Gaud Mayor Hennessy wore
his second-best silk hat and chanced the look
of the sky. Billy Hughes went out with
his missus and a carefully-prepared' speech
about co-operation for farmers, for use at
the luncheon, which was laid in the new
feeding-room. This room boasts a covered-in
piazza pillared with Australian hardwoods
and decorated with lounge seats and tree
ferns.
One of the most successful Show hostesses
was the Duchess of Somewhere-or-other —a
beefy Red Lincoln prize cow with her im-
mense head tied up in a marvellous arrange-
ment of pale ribbon bows. She looked like
a long-nosed, serious aristocrat wearing one
of the fashionable boudoir caps.
The Sassiety rafflers took possession of
the grounds. Kitchener’s Flag was tented
alongside a pots-and-pans kitchen. Two
opposition linen chests almost came to blows.
Mrs. Ilallenstein and her tribe of girl helpers
had one, and Gertrude Rennie, of the
Returned Soldiers’ Rest Home, the other.
The Show creche has grown to huge pro-
portions. Sweet little nurses trained at
the Children’s Hospital are in charge. So
many people want to go in and look at the
young of Man that the nurse at the turn-
stile charges for admittance to her bazaar.
The crfeche was started to help busy mothers
who work about the grounds. This year’s
collection started off with a three-weeks-oid
infant belonging to a -woman helper. Now
the visiting public dump young families
there for the day. Sixpence per child per
day, and cheap at the price. For the sleepers
there are rows of bunk-cribs like sections in
an incubator and a big playground made of
sand for the wakeful. The youngsters gam-
bol with tickets pinned to their backs like
cloak-room luggage. The mother takes a
duplicate check so that there will be no
argument. This year the nurses were nearly
distracted bv the size of the invasion, so
one or two baby-adoring flappers were given
Y.A.D. jobs at lunch-time and got into white
linen uniform for the job.
__ Louisa Henty, of Merino Downs and
Kew, who gave a travelling cooker to the
Defence Department a couple of years ago,
has just received news of the outfit. It is
at Ferry Post, on the edge of the Egyptian
desert. Miss Henty is one of two surviving
daughters of that Western District pioneer
whose kitchen stove, in the early days of
Victorian settlement, used to be the only
white man’s cooker between Portland and
the Murray.
A lot of blood has been shed in the
Empire’s cause by young Harold Beer, son of
an old member of the Vacuum Oil staff in
Melbourne. An officer from Queensland was
to have his leg amputated above the knee,
and the surgeons drew a pint of blood, or
more, from Harold Beer for infusing into
the patient, whose case was regarded as very
doubtful. The borrowed vital fluid did the
trick. The father of the Queenslander
wrote a grateful letter to his son’s creditor,
and the sister of the patient also wrote a
sweet little note on her own, remarking that
she supposed she might venture to introduce
herself to her new “blood relation.” Harold,
in his letters home, hasn’t explained
whether he was the only volunteer for the
sacrificial offering, or whether he was speci-
ally selected on account of his name. So
many of the boys in "hospital think of a
draught of Beer as the one thing they need
to save their lives.
The amusement committee that arranges
diversion for the mental cases among the
returned soldiers is finding that some men
respond marvellously. The shock cases are
oppressed by a seemingly hopeless lethargy—
a complete want of interest in anybody or
anything. The doctors find that these men
begin to look forward to Thursday—the
chief day for drives to the country. Parties
are made up for motoring, and local Red
Cross matrons arrange for tea and music at
the break of the journey. The prescription
is working marvellous cures. Some of the
“shock” cases soon show a- disposition to
wink casually at their cheerers-up.
Young Bob (“Beau”) Wallen, who died
last week, was station-managing for one of
the Ritchies in the Western District when
he came to town and enlisted. After being
in camp for some time he had pneumonia,
and it killed him. His father, Robert Wal-
len, was prominent in financial circles a
generation ago, and brother Frank is a
popular member of Melbourne Exchange.
Stella Power is singing more joyously than
ever since soldier-brother Philip came home.
Though he owns a much-fractured leg and a
few other hurts he smiles more cheerily
than most of the fellows who have never
shifted from home.
The Bendigo Lansells are mourning with
Mrs. Frew over the death in action of
Lieut. Frew. His sister Gwen married Vic-
tor Lanseli, who is just home from the war.
Massey Greene, M.H.R., purrs with pride
because his brother has just gained a bar to
his Military Cross and his sister has married
a British colonel. Massey himself is win-
ning the war as Whip in Hughes’s Parlia-
ment.
Major Richardson is back at barracks
after a trip from one end of Australia to
another. This major is in charge of all the
military nurses, and, of course, is a super-
nurse herself. She wears impressive stripes
and decorations on her grey tunic, and is the
only woman major here. “It is major rank,”
says she, with a little smile, “but it does not
carry major’s pay.”
Sassiety at Sale has been tickled to death
by the upshot of the great hospital scare
that raged for some weeks. The nursing
staff, or a large portion of it, became much
perturbed by visions and rumors of visions
of a man prowling about the hospital
grounds in the small hours when all good
Sale citizens should have gone to shut-eye.
The police were called upon to solve the
mystery of these ghostly saunterings, and
when a nurse, returning late from her
“night off,” encountered a figure in the
gloom and raised a cry of alarm, her dis-
covery turned out to be a watchful police-
inspector on duty. Finally, however, the
real original prowler was caught—and
thereby hangs the joke. The culprit’s iden-
tity proved an awful shock to the com-
mittee, so the story goes, and his -explana-
tion was full of interest for scandalmongers.
Now, scandalmongering is the principal local
industry in the immaculate city of Sale.
A note from Kew :
That dainty cottage which you introduced us to
the other day—the one that Percy Grainger’s archi-
tect-father designed for himself and which the U.S.
Consul and his wife have just moved into—was part
of a stable once. It shows what brains can do with
unpromising material. When “Money” Miller’s
Findon estate was cut up, the sprawling stables were
divided into three and turned into dwellings. Later
on Grainger got one of them, made various altera-
tions, acquired some extra land for a garden—and
there you are!
The Madden dame and the Staughton
widow gave a party in the Botanical Gar-
dens last week, with botanist Cronin to sup-
ply a talk on rural industries. But the rain
descended in torrents, and all the Naice
people had to paddle about in goloshes and
macks. They herded together in the tea
kiosk most of the lugubrious afternoon, and
those on the outer fringe listened drearily to
the lecture while the raindrops trickled
down their necks.
Lady Ellison Macartney stayed awhile
at Stonington on her way to the new
vice-regal job in Westralia. She “did” the
Show and the Stanley christening, and the
Forrest dame earned much overtime beating
up further amusement for her.
The Alexandra Club is getting back its
former secretary. Miss Living, who has been
holidaying in England. Understudy Miss
Clarence had all the fag of the recent move
from the Gas Office to the new Collins-street
quarters.
General Foster, who was booked for retire-
ment after General Legge’s appointment to
his military job, will not have to resume his
lectures on the Siege of Jerusalem, after all.
There being no returned soldiers in Australia,
he has been made secretary to the “Council of
Defence.” This should be a congenial job
for the ex-British officer and his dressy
wife, who is a friend of Mrs. Pearce’s.
The Ross Soden widow’s patriotic bridg-
ing, on Tuesday, overflowed her Toorak pal-
ace from attic to basement, and extra tables
had to be hurriedly spread in the best bed-
rooms. Petticoated brigands led by the
Nyulasy, Dalrymple, Matthews and Morris
misses took possession of the entrance hall
with sweets and a few cartloads of flowers,
which were profitably forced on the card
players. Afternoon-tea was sumptuous.
Melbourne Grammar School Council has
been giving three cheers for the Grimwade
brothers, who have handed over Harleston.
their old home in Balaclava, to the school
as a memorial of their late parents. The
handsome place, which stands in several
acres of park lands, has sheltered the family
since the early ’seventies. In future it will
overflow with dark-blue capped prep, board-
ers. The property is easily worth £lO,OOO
and upwards. The Grimwades are one and
all cheerful givers, both publicly and pri-
vately. The deceased parents set the good
example. Father sat on the School Council
till his death, when his vacant seat was
taken by elder son Harold, now brig.-general.
Fair Adelaide’s bouquet:—
The ricochet from the N. S. Wales strike ha»
smitten us, and for the last two or three days we
have been leading the blameless life that ordefs bed
at 10 p.m. after fumbling through half-lit streets to

On Wednesday the League of Loyal Women cele-
brated its third birthday. The Governor adorned
the chair, and Lady Galway, who is the League’s
president, was the best speaker. In the past 12
months the members of the League have made 10
miles of flannel into shirts for soldiers. Nearly five
thousand new members have taken the sewing oath
in that time.
Lieut. Denny, who was the first M.P. in this State
to enlist, and who was recently seriously wounded,
is getting better. Another S. Australian out of
action is Cecil Bray, who was on the job at Verdun
with a motor ambulance and later was with the Red
Gross Division of the French Army. A shell-burst
wounded him severely in the back. He, too, is
recovering.

An appeal for recruits at the Town Hall by Pro-
fessor Leo C. Galli, archaeologist of the Rome Uni-
versity, who fought as a sergeant in the A.I.F. at Gal-
lipoli, gave us, what we seldom get now, a chance
of hearing a speech by Judge Gordon, who was in
the chair. The Italian patriot is going to tour
the State to see how far he can improve upon his
record of 4089 recruits. By the way, a Sydneysider
is responsible for one of our best recruiting efforts—
Lieut. Harold Boyce, a son of Mr. C. M. Boyce, a
solicitor in the Harbor City. The young man was
here when war broke out and enlisted with a local
unit. From Gallipoli he was invalided to England,
and then fought in France. At Pozieres he was so
badly hurt that his soldiering days seemed over, and
he was invalided back to S.A. After, convalescing,
however, he suggested that he should try to collect
150 men and take them to the Front. He was
allowed seven weeks for the job and finished it in six.
On ’Tuesday the Governor said “Thank-you” to

A baby girl was killed by a motor at
Aspendale recently, and the only witness at
the inquiry was a baby boy of four. It was
a pathetic little court scene. The little chap
told how Sissie was putting nails on the
railway line for the train to “make them
into swords.” The youngster stepped back
to watch the monster engine make her play-
things, then jumped ecstatically out of the
fringe of ti-tree right under a passing motor-
car. The ti-tree fringe along the Point

Christmas boxes for Australian soldiers who

Mr. G. W. HE AX, Chemist.
Dear. Sir, —After 37 years of nerve-racking occupation it is only natural that one’s
nerves would become in a bad state. I was about 30 years a Block Signalman on the
Main Suburban Line, which any Railway Expert will admit is a very trying position.
Abolit six years ago I had to apply for a transfer to a position w T here there would
not be so great a strain on the nerves. I tried, several remedies in the hope of relief
but without success until a friend induced me to try HEAN’S TONIC NERVE NUTs!
and to-day I feel a new man.
I can confidently recommend your remedy to anyone suffering from nerve trouble
Yours faithfully, J. J. HOLT, Night Officer,
Stanmore Station.
HEAN’S TONIC NERVE NUTS purify and enrich the blood, nourish the nerves and strengthen
brain and body.

ABORIGIN
ALITIES
“Captain” : The. natives of certain villages
up the Markham River, New Guinea, wear a round,
rimless hat made of tappa cloth, weirdly marked with
a red dye. .Mounted on top of the headgear is a ball
of wild cotton, colored yellow, whilst at equal dis-
tances round the edge four small yellow feathers
stand upright. Such a lid is the aspiration of every
“boy.” They take getting. Here’s the process. AVhen
a boy kills his first man the sides of his head are
shaved, and his fuzzy ’hair is manipulated till it bears
a rough resemblance to a hat. He is then entitled to
enter for the matrimonial stakes, and having taken
a woman unto himself and enjoyed a speedy honey-
moon, he goes manhunting. If he meets with success
his reward is one shell-band worn on the right arm.
This puts ginger into the sport, so he lays for another
victim. Having bagged the game the hunter is
allowed to make and wear the circular tappa hat—
without decorations—-and is also entitled to put a
small bunch of cowrie-shell on his left arm. Full
of heart the simple child of nature stalks and slays
another victim, and returning home up goes the big
white feather and yellow ball of fluff; also, one more
shell arm-band. By now a handy tradesman, he
sticks at his job till two more niggers “go finish,”
and small yellow feathers are granted for each of
the operations. Two are worn on the front of the
cadey, another goes on the back and one on each
side. The millinery being complete a feast is given,
and the artist proudly dons it for the first time in
the presence of the tribe, the proceedings being
finished off with a “sing-sing.”
“E.S.S.”: Where did the idea that “coo-ee”
was a Binghi call originate? Here you are—Captain
Hunter's Journal on the discovery and examination of
the Hawkesbury River in 1789: “In the woods we
frequently saw fires, and sometimes heard the natives;
in the afternoon we saw a considerable number of
people in the wood, with many fires in different
places. AVe called to them in their own manner by
frequently repeating the word coo-wee, which sig-
nifies ‘come here.’ ” Among many tribes, in S. Aus.
especially, the call was coo-00, like a long-drawn
pigeon-cal', with the same meaning—“come here.”
Coo-ee, according to the oldest inhabitant (who may
be dead now), was also the call of the vanished Tas-
manian blacks. AVebster’s Dictionary defines it: “A
peculiar whistling sound made by the Australian
aborigines as a call or signal." Some old-timers assert
that it was imitative of the call-howl of the dingo,
while others argue that it was an imitation of the
far-sounding note of the wonga-pigeon. There is
certainly no outcry known in the bush that can
equal it in penetrative power. Phonetically, “coo-ee”
is the call of the bushwoman ; the male notes are more
like “ca-a-w-whey,” the first syllable lingering and
comparatively low, the second loud, sharp and abrupt
—a deep liquid sound formed in the throat and
forcibly ejected, which is the secret of its far-
reaching quality.
* * * »
“Wal”: Regarding the remarks of “Te
Babarantiko” on tucker obtainable in Papua, it is
quite true that most of what is served up at places
like Samarai and Port Moresby is imported from
Australia. But on plantations and mission-stations
the food is generally from the land, and the menu
is always a good one. The energetic settler grows
his own vegetables, raises fowls and eggs, and has a
four-legged cow on the premises. AVith the help of
game supplied by the “shooting boy,” a gentleman
of importance on every plantation, a supply of fresh
pork (wild), as well as pigeons, ducks and other
edible birds, is assured. The house-wife, if she is a true
Australian, attends to her own kitchen, and has the
help of two or three native rouseabouts. Seldom if
ever does canned ballast appear on the table in
the pristine horribleness of the tin; such of it as is
used is disguised in a way that makes detection
difficult. The average planter or missionary lives
as well as, if not better than, the average dweller in
Sydney or Melbourne.
* * * *
“Yokwe Yuk”: If experience had not
taught me otherwise, “Te Pana's” par some months
ago on the dangers of coral would make me decidedly
scared ; but at various times during a quarter of a
century I have been cut and scratched all over my
body by living coral without more serious results
than come from abrasions made by ordinary rocks or
shells. But the wounds should be kept clean.
A LARGE QUESTION.
O’HARA. J.P. ( sternly): "D'ye deny the eternity av this child?”
THE BUSINESS OF PUNCHING THE MISSUS.
“Well, now, Mrs. ’ logins , my 'usband may be a bit ’andy at callin' me a cow when ’e’s
in drink; but fancy the lives them fellers' wives must lead wif punckin' an shoot-
in ’ on’ all.”
"Quail” : According to Waite, some death-
adders grow to a greater length than the 27in. of the
Eden Creek (N.S.W.) reptile mentioned by “Lan-
tana” (B. 13/9/’l7). On page 63 of “Australian
Snakes” he says: “The death-adder is a short, thick
and clumsy reptile, seldom seen longer than about
2ft., but occasionally obtained of a greater size. The
largest I have seen measures 2ft. sAin., but it is the
only specimen I know at all approaching such
dimensions.” At Cucigen, North Coast, about 20
years ago I saw one which stretched across five 6in.
boards on a verandah, and consequently beat Waite’s
best bv a nose or thereabouts. Let “H.V.E.” (B.
10/5/’l7) and “Pendanus” (B. 13/9/’l7) listen to
what Waite has to say about the death-adder’s tail:
“The scales are keeled, and the tail, which is short
and narrow, terminates in a spine. Many persons
imagine that the venomous properties are contained
in this spine, an idea which may be at once dis-
pelled. Although the function of the spine is not
clear, it probably assists In progression.”
“Mrs. Lance Rawson”: Ehe habit of the
native women on the Markham, New Guinea, who carry
the heads of their deceased husbands reminds me of a
custom that prevails among certain tribes of North
Queensland. Years back I assisted at the unpacking
of a somewhat unsavory body which had been dropped
by a gin in full flight from station hands in the act
of dispersing abos. who had been spearing cattle for
steaks cut from the live animal—a very common
custom among abos. in those old days. The corpse
was artistically preserved in red earth and bark.
The internal organs had been removed and the body
doubled over, no doubt with a view to making it
handier to pack. The lady who had dropped her
bundle was expected to carry it round on her back
for two years. I have several times seen smaller
packs carried by devoted mothers, and these were
dead sons of chiefs. I never saw or heard of a
female being carried around.
“Ibe”: Excuse me—the best substitute
for tobacco is crushed pumpkin seeds, ironbark pre-
ferred, sprinkled with a very small quantity of rum.
* * * „
“Skeeter”: Allow me into the divining-
rod scuffle. I was out in the Trangie-Warren district
(N.S.W.) up to 1909, and, like many a know-all,
scoffed at the rod ; but a few excursions with W. T.
Papworth, of Trangie, made me take my hat off to
ft. I have been with him, driving slowly along a
road, when he has located a stream with the aid of
an ordinaiy plaited-handle buggy-whip. At that
time McKinnon, of Derribong station, would not
think of sinking a well without the aid of the rod,
although he had been a sceptic until after the fol-
lowing test. Papworth had just located a well, and
had driven a couple of miles away into a paddock
where he succeeded in making another find. McKin-
non there had him blindfolded, and the diviner led
right back to the first site, proving that both wells
were on the same stream. Mind you, this was in the
Bogan country, which is notorious for underground
water. J. T. Horrigan, of Myall Mundi, himself
possesses the gift, and is a firm believer in the
efficacy of the rod, but would not dream of sinking
unless the location had been approved of by Pap.
worth. Body, of Bundemar station, in desperation
called him in during the 1902 drought, and was
rewarded with a wonderful supply which watered
thousands of sheep. During this drought Papworth
was in great request at a fiver a time, and a party
of well-sinkers added substantially to their bank
accounts by following him round working gn the
condition “No water, no money.” That shows confi-
dence in the twig. His method was to break a fairly
lengthy twig (not forked) off any box-sucker, and
hold it in one hand. 'Then he would proceed at an
ordinary pace through the bush until the sucker
showed by its downward movement that water was
underfoot. I never heard him venture a prediction
as to depth.
OH. THE IMPUDENCE!
MISTRESS: "In the time it takes me to tell
non how to do the work I could do it
myself.”
MAID: “ Yes'm. And in the time it takes mt
to listen, so could I.”
“Kola”: Request “The Colonel’ (®-
30/8/’l7) to stand up and have a lesson about Late
Elingamite. (1) He says that eels do not bite in the
moonlight. They bite at any time, if they are about,
although ther- prefer a dark night. (2) He says thal
he wonders how the Elingamite eels breed, as the lakf
has no outlet. Elingamite Creek runs into Emu Creek
thence to the sea. (3) He says that there are no
other fish but eels in Elingamite. Perch are there in
millions, and are the fish usually chased. Sit dovn.

AT THE SIGN OF THE STINKING FISH.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
There's never a laugh in the Stinking Fish or the
echoes of jovial song;
No sticks beat time on the sanded floor as a chorus
roars along;
You, look in vain for a smiling face, you wait for a
well-spun yarn
Of the rolling sea by a rolling tar or a tinker’s
fight in a barn;
No soldier clad in his scarlet ghy talks battles for
mugs of ale,
But village ancients with rheumy eyes sit round
in a circle pale;
They groan and grizzle of days to be, foretelling the
Crack of Doom,
AA'hile a serving-maid with a sour, flat face goes
flouncing about the room.
She has an eye like a thoughtful shark and a face
like an old. flat dish,
But it’s good enough for the dreary crew who groan
at the Stinking Fish.
Oh, keep you away from the Stinking Fish and
heed not the tales there told
As they sip and rub their ancient shins to banish
Death’s creeping cold!
For their hearts are dead, and their minds are
dead, and the graveyard yawns for all,
And the sexton waits to spade their beds and lend
them an ancient pall;
But he can't set to with his pick and spade while
the breath remains in each
And the serving-maid with the sour, flat face leaves
drinks within their reach.
Quavering groans from a ring of bones, a sigh and
a dotard’s “Pish!”
And that’s how the profitless days go by at the sign
of the Stinking Fish.

STRENGTH AND ENERGY CREATED
BY PHOSPHATE.
NO TASK TOO HARD; NO STRAIN
TOO GREAT.
There is no longer any reason why the
nervous, hesitant' man or woman should
envy those who are strong, resourceful and
calm, fox’, according to an eminent specialist,
such strength is within the easy reach of
all who desire it. Men and women are
strong, mentally and physically, in propor-
tion to the strength of their nerves, and
nerves are strong or weak according to the
amount of phosphate they absorb. Ordi-
narily the nerves derive phosphate from
digested food, but owing to faulty meta-
bolism or to abnormal strain, the phosphate
thus taken up often proves insufficient, and
in consequence the nerves become weak and
exhausted. To remedy such a condition it
is necessary that the nerves should be pro-
vided with more phosphate, and the use of
the concentrated hitro-phosphate which most
chemists now’ stock in the form of 5-grain
compressed tablets is highly recommended.
Phosphate in this form is rapidly absorbed,
and a decided improvement in the general
health is soon noticeable. Nerves become
steady and strong, and the brain acts
quickly and clearly. Eyes become bright,
and the cheeks glow with healthy color.
No task seems too hard ; no strain too great.
Abundant energy displaces lassitude, and
great strength reigns in the place of weak-
ness.— Advt.

“Paul Cupid” : Billjim often diverts good
silver from its legitimate use by paying for the
repair of bridles broken througli not knowing how to
tie his quadruped up. This is the plan: pass an inch
rope under the beast’s tail, and cross with a double
twist over his loin ; bring the ends together and knot
them at his chest; lead him up to the fence, pass the
reins over the rail, bring them back and tie them to
the rope aforesaid. You can now settle down to your
beer and memories of the girls of yesterday with a
calm mind. \\ hen you stroll out to see how the
steed is faring, you find a very submissive and
ciest-fallen bridle-breaking expert. He had leaped
back in his usual style, but the tug came in a most
unusual manner on his opposite end, with such pain-
ful and humiliating results that he resolved to never,
never do it again.

.Tacko” : All the initiative and resource
hasn’t gone to France and Egypt. The other day I
came across a lanky cocky youth in charge of a big
traitor turnout on a western N. S. Wales road. The
trucks in tow had gone over a too-handy embankment.
When they were hauled back on to the road a heavy
coupling-bar was found to be very badly bent, and
with the nearest blacksmith well over the skyline it
looked as if the whole transport was there for a
donkey’s age. But Cocky, jun., sauntered to the
front of the engine, placed the bar on the road, and
sent the tractor over the bent length. I’ll bet against
any forgeman making a neater job. In another
lOmin. the plant was rattling forward once more.

“Hay”: “Moobitta” (B. 23/8/’l7) took
the wrong roo by the tail when he introduced “fight-
ing’ euros. The euro is a small, mild-mannered
kanga, and nothing in a scrap. The champion of the
100 family is the black scrubber, a big, dark-skinned
fellow, inhabiting the Flinders Ranges (S. Aus.) and
the scrubby land in the south-west part of N. S.
B ales. No doubt he was the competent stoush-
dealer that “Moobitta” collided with. The scrubber
fears neither dog nor man, and is always ready to
put ’em up. He will come to meet his hunter fiith
the greatest gameness, and he is an adversary to be
treated with respect on account of the length and
strength of his steel-like claws.

“Billy T”: There is a curious quality in
Australian bush courtship which I never find else-
where. Ann was a sort of confidential domestic
rouseabout in Baker's house at Glow Lake. She was
essentially bush-bred, hardened with graft, a little
ungainly in action, eyes rather screwed in, hair
rather suggestive of the long drought, and tanned in
ail visible parts; yet not at all unpleasing to look
upon. She was giving the whole place a “thorough
turnover” and a “reg’lar clean up,” because Bill
was coming back. Bill had been “workin’ at the
war” for a year and nine months. He was returning
with the loss of fingers and other minor bits and
pieces. The “reg lar clean up” extended even to the
cowshed, which looked as neat as a hospital
ward when Ann had done with it. Ann and Bill
were lovers, I understood ; marriage was an imminent
possibility. Ann did up the garden because Bill was
returning. She painted the front of the house, put
new' paper on the W'alls. ’Tw'as she started the
phonograph as he came up the track. Then she retired
to the kitchen. Vt hen Bill had met everybody else
Ann ventured to the parlor. The two looked at each

other. Both grinned awkwardly. “Elio, Ann!” said
Bill. “EUo, Bill!” said Ann; “so you got back?”
And that was all. Another family I knew at Wallace
(Vie.) had a regular Sunday-afternoon visit from a
chap from over the hill. He just drifted in, hung
round, ate a big tea, and drifted out again. “Who
is he?” I asked the elder son eventually. “He’s
the bloke what's courtin’ Mary.” “Who is Mary?”
“Mary, me sister.’’ “But where is Mary?” “Oh,
Mary’s bin dead a year. But he ain’t broke hisself
of the habit.”

THE PUPIL: “ 'Cause mother said I needn't. Mother never learnt geography and SHE

“P.W.”: Daniel Bunce, naturalist and
botanist to Leichhardt’s expedition, 1846, mentioned
the use of “the hillocks made by the white-ants” He
wrote: “Where they are situated near a hut, the
hutkeepers convert them into ovens for baking-
bread ; and in any case they form, if properly man-,
aged, floors as firm as Roman cement.”

“Silas Snell”; Ever hear of the melon
mystery which worried Tipdray some 30 years ago?
The melon was accepted as a natural phenomenon
by the editor of the Tipdray Advocate, and its
reputation spread: it even turned up in America 11
months later. James Lygon was the hero of the
mjstery; he, at any rate, was the discoverer of the
strange vegetable with its curious occupant, and it
was he who carried the melon to the Advocate
office with the snake still inside it as a guarantee of
good faith. It was an uncommonly large melon, and
Lvgon in attempting to cut it up had discovered the
black snake in its interior. He had
tomahawked a crack in the iron-
crusted vegetable large enough to
render the serpent visible, but through
which it could not make its escape.
Since it could not get out by this
opening, it was obvious it could not
have got in. How then had it got
in? James Lygon produced five wit-
nesses io prove that he found the
serpent in the virgin melon. The
Advocate editor took a serious inter-
est in the matter. The melon con-
taining the snake was on view at his
office to convince the sceptical. The
frog in the rock was not a source of
greater wonder. Finally, with its
reptilian occupant intact, it was sent
to an eminent biologist in Melbourne,
and scientists made small pilgrimages
to view the quaint growth. Then just
f as speculation was getting warm the
melon mystery blew up. Quong Lee, of Tipdray, took
action against James Lygon for stealing his melons
In court he swore: “Some feller stealem plenty
melon. Me cut stalk out, makee place, puttem snake
alonga msi’, feed him plenty lil mouse. Stiekem
stalk back evely night. Lygon come steadit melon
nnd him snake—oh, Cli!”

“Gazer”: I read a complaint that the
quaint hats worn by the ladies of a recent
ballet were a mistake because they “hid the
wearers’ eyes.”
I saw it not, but do surmise
The management is wrongly chidden—
It seems to me both right and wise
That sometimes something should be hidden.
“Row A”: Let’s see if we can find the
worst song on earth. I have never heard
anything to beat a ditty that was popular
about 10 years ago. Most people will
remember this much of it:—
If all the stars were mine, love,
I know what I would do;
I’d give them all for a glass of wine
With you, my love, with you.
Would it be possible to better express the
sentiments of a besotted bookmaker?
One of the biggest of recent films is to
come from S’Africa. It is to be called (in-
correctly) “Winning a Continent,” and is to
tell the story of the now-British southern
portion. It claims to have employed more
players than any other known film, thou-
sands of Zulus and other natives having
joined in, with great enthusiasm and at
small expense, to reconstruct battle scenes.
Botha is said to have approved of both plan
and picture.
Seymour Hicks has set a good example by
altering the casting in an up-to-date ver-
sion of his old success, “Wild Thyme.” He
realises that he is now too old to be the
ideal lover, so takes the part of the funny
man —to the great advantage of both parts.
The homely name of Martha Boggs on a
Tivoli programme brings to mind a radiant
top-boot dancer of the long ago. She was
well past her flapperage, and not a very
brilliant performer; but she made an irre-
sistible appeal for your sympathy by billing
herself as “Miss Sylvia Dearlove.” Yet, life
being • full of surprises, Boggs may be
assumed and Dearlove a genuine family
moniker.
“Theorbo”: The earliest production of
“Maritana” in Melbourne that I can trace
was in 1856, at the Olympic, by a small com-
pany from London, including tenor Sher-
win, basso Farquharson, and prima-donna
Miss Harland. Last was the wife of Hos-
kins, who accompanied the show. He tried
to persuade his young pupil Henry Irving
to make one of the party. Hoskins acted in
farces put on after the opera.
The Cappelli-Scamuzzi fragment of the
shattered Gonsalez Opera Co., with which
she is touring, has fastened the absurd name
of Signorina Verona on to Gladys Bourke,
a young Sydney Conservatorium student.
The girl made a capital start in Adelaide—
so good a start that this paper is annoyed at
Australia being robbed of the credit of it. ft
is quite time this country had an emphatic
word to say on this matter of false labelling.
“Jeune Premier”: “Norbell” on make-up

was making my first appearance at a
town “somewhere in Victoria.” Stand-
ing in the wings, waiting for my cue,
I was accosted in aggrieved tones by
the manager/ “Good Gord,” he exclaimed,
“you’re surely not going on like that!” »e
pointed an agitated finger at the back of m
head. Seeing I didn’t tumble, “You’re wea -
ing your own hair,” he moaned. And I was.
I was rather proud of my crop, and con-
fessed to having a partiality for my natur
topknot on the stage, more especially i
“straight” parts. “But you don’t know' tn
audience,” he went on. “ They look }o>
wig here!” I rushed back to the dressing-
room and quickly donned the only “jasey
possessed. It was of a warm bnck-r
color. Need I say that I was the success
the night?

Tlie enterprising London trader improves
the bombing hour by offering “safe shop-
ping.” The. CHil Service Store makes a
feature of its bomb-proof roof:—
It is of course impossible to guarantee safety even
under the most favorable conditions, but so far as
one can judge the Civil Service Store in the Hay-
market is amply fitted to be a suitable shelter. The
roof is protected by three feet of concrete. Our
staff is drilled in raid drill, to prevent anything
resembling panic or crowding, and in our wine and
grocery cellars we have plenty of space for staff and
customers.
A recent raid got among the banks, and one
Australian and one Maoriland London office
had the shock of their lives. However, there
is usually a fair amount of warning, and the
general rule among the banks is that, after
having put away any cash, etc., in their
custody, the clerks can, if they wish, retire
to the vaults. A few weeks ago a bomb was
dropped close to a big English bank. It
simply splintered the windows, and after-
wards the manager’s table was found to be
like a pincushion. The manager had the
luck not to be at home. The banks, after this
raid, undertook to insure their clerks for
£5OO a head.

“M.P.A.”: Australia exported well over
half a million worth of goods, principally
food products, to Java during a period of 12
months. With a native population of over
30 millions, thousands of Chinese, a high-
living European section, and a fast-increas-
ing half-caste community, Australian trade
could double and treble itself if pushed with
vigor. Armenians have a considerable share
in hotel management and trade, and every
Armenian I met cried out for more butter,
preserves, fruit and ham. The agents can’t
get enough of our ham for hotels and home
use, quite apart from the Chinese demand.
In the midst of this rise in our export trade,
the Dutch Royal Packet Co. is talking seri-
ously of taking its ships off the Australian
run owing to continual labor troubles in
loading and discharging cargo at our ports.

“Bert R.” introduces some good Austra-
lians :
The pair of boots I am wearing now were issued
to me at Serapeum in February, 1916. They served
me well during the bitter, slushy weather that we
struck just after landing in France, and after the
burning sands of Egypt this was surely enough to
settle any boots; yet with a little dubbin mine were
still going strong when I left the battalion, wounded,
in August. The number of miles I had marched in
them makes me tired to think of. I had them half-
soled while in hospital, then wore them throughout
the coldest and wettest winter known in England for
36 years, and last month borrowed an old cotfple to
wear while the cobbler did another job. Behold
them now, without the sign of a crack, though
scratched in places by Fritz’s barb-\yire, polished
to such brightness that they twinkle in the dark!
Compare this with the record of “Tommy” boots
in the same section —the wearers averaged a new
pair every month. As to our tunics, it is impossi-
ble to wear them out with ordinary rough usage. I
had mine 16 months, and then, in spite of tears by
barb-wire and shrapnel splinters, it was still
reckoned good enough to go on furlough with.
There is nothing to come up to Australian clothing,
and nobody knows it better than the troops in the
field.

Melbourne tenants are now complaining
that the exorbitant charges of furniture re-

them to escape the clutches of bone-grinding
landlords. The high cost of leaving!

“Edo” : The other day, in Melbourne, the
Cost of Living Commission was told by
master bakers that it cost over Id. to deliver
bread. More than a year ago, at Kalgoorlie,
when the State Food Prices Commission sat
on the goldfields, the boss dough-punchers
averred something of the Same kind. The
low-down Commission, however, replied:
“21b. loaf 4d. at the bakehouse, 4Jd. off the
cart.” No sooner was the new rule enforced
than the bakers refused to sell over the
counter, for the obvious reason that there
was and is profit in delivering 21b. weight at
a time, and at Kalgoorlie everything con-
nected with the trade is far more expensive
than at Melbourne. When will perjurers
before public commissions be prosecuted?
“North Coast”: Here’s another bush
woman who knows how to look after herself.
She won the sulky that was the first prize
in the Jerseyville (N.S.W.) Show art union
—tickets one shilling. This was the next
thing the committee heard: “The sulky
arrived, but there was no spanner. Should
not there have been one? I always under-
stood oue was given with each sulky, but
perhaps the one with this sulky may have
been dropped in transit. Could you send
me another one?” The committee is slowly
recovering. # *
Being a man of action, and not a mere
word-spinner, Henry Jam Jones, of Hobait,
has got tired of waiting for Hughes s ship-
building scheme to be anything more than a
scheme. On his own account he has there-
fore set Purdon and Featherstone, the chiet
local ship-artists, to draw plans for three
big schooners. 135 ft. on the keel and loOft.
overall, 30ft. in the beam and 13ft. deep,
which will register about 600 tons. He pio-
poses to lay them down right away and use
them for the inter-State trade. These will
be the biggest vessels ever built in the
Speck. In the old sailing-ship days dozens
of sea-going square-rigged vessels were
turned! out on the Derwent and Huon, but
the largest of them was 400 tons. The
Colossus was the Tasman, built at Battery
Point in 1853 by Harry Degraves.

“F.N.T.”: A word for an Australian in-
dustry—the making of all-cane chairs. Over
six years ago I bought an Australian-made
“granny.” Most chairs of this cheap but
capacious kind get that sad, tired feeling
after a few years, leaning decrepitly
towards the sou’-sou’-west and swaying
uneasily whenever anybody takes a chance
and sits down ; but my twelve-and-sixpenny
article, in spite of frequent use, is as firm
on its woven-cane foundation as ever it was.
This sturdy bit of furniture was made by
men who never saw a chair in their lives.
It came from the Blind Institute in St. Kilda-
road, where every day an army of brush,
broom and chair craftsmen show what the
battling Australian can do in spite of a
biutal handicap— and under a time-card
system.
“Victim”: “Duct” (B. 13/9/’l7), writing
on the subject of suprarenal glands being
used for medicinal purposes, asks if anyone
knows anything about it. I have used for
spasmodic asthma of long standing adrena-
lin, which is the pressor principle of the
suprarenal gland, and is usually prescribed
per hypodermic injection, the dosage varying
with different medical attendants, some being
in favor of large and others small charges.
They should really not allow its use in any
quantity. The immediate effect in my case
was to relieve the difficult breathing ; but re-
administration was required every two
hours. Ultimately I was unable to get along
without it. The effect it. had on the blood-
vessels was to render thejn senile. My
advice to sufferers is “Leave it alone.”

Away back in 1876 James Paterson and
Co. had a tug called the Albatross built in
Scotland, and as she could not very well
carry enough coal for the long trip south she
was rigged as a three-masted schooner, and
came here under sail. After working as a
tug in Port Phillip, with the sticks taken out
of her, for many years she was laid up in
“Rotten Row” ; but now, in her 41st year,
she has been pulled out and is being rigged
as a schooner once more.

L. W. Matters from the Far North: —
With gladness the traveller in the Orient remem-
bers the Biblical story of the scourging of the money-
changers from the Temple. They are pirates, from
the first one that climbs the accommodation ladder
and lies about the rate of exchange to the benign old
gentleman with the tortoise-shell spectacles who pre-
sides over the money-exchange bank.
The money-changer in Shanghai is the most pic-
turesque thief of all. In China, as everybody knows,
the unit is the tael. Nobody has ever seen a tael
to my knowledge. It is a legend. The actual unit
of sale and purchase is the Mexican dollar, which is
of silver when it isn’t of pewter. Just why China
should have adopted the coinage of a distant, dis-
reputable, fighting, brawling, paper-money faking
country like Mexico as a medium of exchange I don’t
know, but there are wise people who do.
When there isn’t a world war on, these dollars are
worth about 2s. 4d. They bear some mysterious
relation to the tael which nobody has been able to
fathom, and as the war has put up the price of silver
even when alloyed with dirt and grease, the Mexican
dollar has gone up in sympathy with the tael. In
Shanghai the other day you could get $1.15 for it
in small change. It looked too good to be true, but
when I went along to a money-changer with a dollar
and received $1.14 in five- and 10-cent pieces I was
so astonished that I forgot to have a row over the
odd cent. It looked like the most substantial get-
rich-quick thing I had ever seen in America, Asia or
elsewhere. So I went along to the cable office to
resign a poorer job in Japan. The cablegram was
carefully worded not to give offence. The cost was
$8.40. I produced two or three pounds of small
change. Then I awoke. The cable company did not
accept one hundred of that kind of cent on the
dollar. It wanted 116. It also advised me that the
same rate obtained everywhere for small coins ten-
dered in payment of substantial accounts. Too
true! I was done by the money-changer again.
Nobody wanted 100 cents for a dollar, but all wanted
116, and I had bought at 114 i at best.
Yes, the money-changers were properly treated in
Jerusalem. I hope the scourge was dipped in brine.
SHE DOES HER BIT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Melinda will not knit the socks
For keeping warm the fighters’ feet;
She does not serve at four o’cloclcs
Where patriotic matrons meet
To crochet woollen cummerbunds,
Or make collections for the funds.
Melinda on gay Button Days
Won’t haunt the streets in costume loud,
Parading favors spread on trays,
Cajoling shillings from the crowd ;
Yet, standing out, the little miss
Still graciously approves of this.
Melinda does not in the rooms
Cut sandwiches and sugar tea,
Nor to the wards bear scented blooms
To cheer the wounded men ; yet she
Admits it’s nice, and only fair,
That every girl should do her share.
No bandages Melinda sews ;
She packs no billies gallon-size.
Think not the duty that she owes
The dear girl fails to recognise,
For on the regulation day
Melinda draws three soldiers’ pay !

SMALL CHANGE AND MOONLIGHT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Following on the report of F. N. Yarivood, the
Government Commissioner, fares on Mosman and
other ferries have been raised to threepence.
By Yarwood’s silver ferries the Mosmen come to
to town,
Although it might be cheaper to swim halfway and
drown ;
Instead of tarnished coppers the turnstile trays are
laid
With those same scraps of silver that cheer the par-
son’s trade.
No more the silver moonlight upon the waters
spilled
Enchants the ferry traveller, for oh! his heart is
filled
With stern financial troubles. And so he looks
away.
The water of the Harbor gleams like a turnstile
tray.

CUPID.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I’d joined the circle of the gods
To see a sentimental play.
Upon my left there were two clods
From somewhere Boobyallock way.
Upon my right a girl with eyes
Like flaming planets in the skies.
And lips! Such cherries as invite
A man to venture all and bite!
The packer came and moved us in.
He jambed us closer, till we sat
Like little sardines in a tin;
And then he gave an extra pat,
And wedged a stout old lady down.
Two hearts were beating in my brown
Sac coat. How soon it conquered me
That sweet law of propinquity 1
We wed. Thereafter, did Igo
To see a play, the packer lean,
Though plastered with a catlike mo.,
With ferret eyes of rancid green,
Knock-kneed, sag-jawed, with nose awry,
Was Cupid to my wondering eye;
And nightly was his duty done
Of squeezing two folks into one.

IMPORTANT
Look to Your Teeth.
There are no teeth like those furnished by
Nature. For service, comfort and good
health artificial teeth cannot be com-
pared with a natural set.
Sensible people will accordingly try to pre-
serve their teeth as long as possible by
keeping them clean. Cold water and soap
and water are useful, but are somewhat
ineffectual. Rough powders, such as cuttle-
fish, crabseyes, crude chalks and charcoal
are too severe on the enamel.
EIDENTA TOOTH PASTE is scientifi-
cally prepared to clean the teeth, sweeten
the breath, harden the gums and disinfect
the mouth (thus preventing decay).
EUDENTA is therefore regarded as “the
perfection of dental luxuries.” 1/- tube every-
where. Post fiW, 1/3. Free sample posted.

POLITICAL
POINTS
Six years ago the public works into which
N. S. Wales had then put its hundred
millions or so of loan money were supposed
to be paying more than working exes, and
interest, but in the past four years they
have failed to do it, and every year the
failure has got worse and worse: —
191* •• .. Deficit £163,208
1915 . . . . „ 312,887
1916 .. .. „ 666,433
1917 .. .. „ 1,011,265
hich means that every year the taxpayer
has had to dip deeper into his pocket to
make up the interest which the works have
not earned. _ Things may improve in some
respects during the next few years; for a
few millions that have not been earning any-
thing, being represented by uncompleted
fragments of vote-catching works scattered
over the country, may come more or less
into bearing. On the other hand, over
£37,000,000 of loans will have to be renewed
within the next three years; and that means
another half-million to pay out every year in
higher interest. All this burden can be
carried only by production; and instead of
producing more the Government is still hard
at work borrowing, and a big part of the
community spends half its time on strike.
Listen to the. latest reply of the Phewsion
to the accusation that no wars had been
won so far:—
Millen: We were elected with handcuffs upon us in
relation to this question.
So this is what all the frowsy huckstering
and the loud professions of six months ago
boil down to—a junta-free, triumphant
party, manacled and impotent! It seems
about up to Millen to now explain how much
longer he considers that office should be held
by a Win-the-War Ministry that is capable
only of inhabiting a funk-hole.
SATISFACTORY.
CREDITOR : “You couldn't go round in your
fine motor-car if you paid your debts.”
DEBTOR: “ That's so! I am glad you look at
it in the same light that I do.”
The N. S. Wales Railways Superannua-
tion Fund calls for immediate attention.
W hen the politicians were angling for the
railway vote seven years ago the fund was
created, and certain benefits were promised
in return for contributions from the service
eoual to 14 per cent, of salaries. All that
the public was asked to put up was £7OOO
a year. As everybody was aware who knew
anything about the matter, 14 per cent, was
absurdly inadequate; the Police Superannu-
ation Fund is only kept solvent by a 4 per
cent, contribution. Nevertheless, the shani -
hil thing went through, and in the past four
years the insurance fund has been reduced
from £.>].074 to £13,581. As plain smash
was ahead the Treasurer lately dipped h s
hand into the public’s pocket for £80,000;
and unless the honest thing is done and the
fund put upon a reasonable basis, the dip-
ping will have to continue. An actuarial
report should be called for at once.
RISKING IT IN BITS.
CONDUCTOR: "Here, why don't you pay right
through instead of a separate penny at
each section?”
PASSENGER: “ Ah no, dere might he another
thtrike before ve get right through.”
The Country party in the House of Reps,

fashes the other day—and got them. Story
was shunted from the Public Works Com-
mittee in favor of Sinclair. Story, as a con-
tractor, had proved a valuable member of
the Committee, so far as it has any value,
and Sinclair is a very stodgy substitute. In
the election for the Public Accounts Com-
mittee, also, Poynton was pushed in and
howler displaced, though Fowler has been
the brains of the Committee. Poynton didn’t
shape badly as a Treasurer ; all the same, it
was only because he was a nominee of the
Country party that he was elected to the
other job. The fact is that the Country
party sees what a shameless grab the whole
W indy YV ar election was, so it joins in the
scramble.
As showing what Party can do when there
are votes to be bought and a clear run to
the pawnshop, N. S. Wales has at Homebush
Ray certain abattoirs which the Wade crowd
commenced as a £lBO.OOO job. The borrowed
money spent to date is £1.260 000, and it is
estimated that £2,000.000 will have been
shovelled overboard by the time the place
does what it was originally designed for
And then the huge capital outlay will make
meat a penny a pound dearer to the
struggling Sydneyite! When there was
hardly any excuse for giving out any more
work at Homebush Bay the ingenious Hol-
man Labor Government discovered that the
Acclimatization Society had started a new
zoo at Taronga Park. “Let’s do this for
.vou somebody pleaded. Of course the
society jumped at the chance. So the wav
was made easy for spending another £150.000
oi more nearer £300,000 when consequent
ti anilines, etc., are taken into account.
Growing eloquent at the meeting of the
Great Boulder in London, qhairman G. P
Doolette said that in the last 23 years
Westralia had produced gold to the value
f ] «40.pq0,000 aid paid otS
tl_b,ooo,ooo m dividends. Great BonldprG
own contribution to those totals had been
£10,648.441 in production and £5.072.425 in
dividends. Then he stopped. He didn’t go
on to say that in the 28 years the State’s
whack of all this wealth had been an in-
crease in the public debt from £2.800.000 to
£80,000,000.
From last week’s despatches about the
remains of the strike: —
At Sydney Trades Hall about 3000 families receive
supplies of the necessaries of life.
The Benevolent Society is providing food for 750
families.
Hollow-eyed want is staring at us from hundreds
of homes.
And so on. A magnificent exhibition of
Squalidarity, so to speak.
There is a dark suspicion that the Fed-
eral Parliament was rushed into recess in
order to prevent, or, anyway, postpone, the
disruption of the Windy-War party. That it
is not really a family at all, let alone a happy
family, has been evident for some time ; never
more so than when the Government was
forced to withdraw its proposal to impose a
special tax upon
single' eligibles. A
new member, barris-
ter Maxwell, led th°
opposition to the
proposal from the
Government side
and did not lack
supporters. K v e r
since the elections
the Argus has been
assuring its readers
that everything in
the garden is lovely,
but this attack
shocked it into let-
ting the feline out
of the bag. “An
unpleasant feature
of the proceedings,”
remarked the old
lady, “was the fact
that a number of
members in the
Ministerial corner
chuckled over the
set-back as if it were
to them a personal
triumph. They ought,
of course, to have
been sorry that
their consciences had
compelled them to
oppose the Ministry
and bring it to surrender with a flank fire;
but if that was their state of mind their
grief was admirably concealed.”
‘‘The right of citizens to criticise Gov-
ernments, which are rarely free from criti-
cism, must be abated and minimised,” says
Vic. Governor S-sh-sh-sh-tanley.

This criticism here and now must stop.

is _ that, though the Railway Commissioners
might reduce exes, by running fewer trains
they can’t reduce the interest charge. In
other words, the tramways have reduced the
capital value of the railways; but not a
penny of the loans has been paid off. because
the lie has been repeatedly told that these
works are “permanent and reproductive.”

The extraordinary expenditures in connection with

need of stringent regulation. In deference to a
Ministerial decision that the matter should stand

present bringing the matter under the notice of
Parliament. In view of this decision I also refrain
from the presentation of other matters, such as
gifts in kind to various persons and officials.

SPORTING
NOTIONS
The totalisator was given its first spin
in the paddock at Randwick on Saturday, in compe-
tition, of course, with about a quarter of an acre
of bawling Ike. The proceedings were, on the whole,
satisfactory, though there were hitches which created
annoyance. On the Monday things went more
smoothly. The sum handled on the opening day was
£26,000 ; on the second, £28,000. This is sub-
stantially less than might reasonably have been ex-
pected. The main thing about it all, however, was
the clear indication that the public wants the
machine; that when people get accustomed to the
thing they will want it more; and that when a little
additional time is allowed between races and the
money is taken more rapidly the patronage will
certainly be greater. The second-horse dividend is
a great draw. The diversion of money from
MacShortodds was painful in some parts of the ring,
but the bigger odds-merchants found it making but
little difference to them. Most of the larger bets
went to the old address. How much longer it will
be necesssary to continue providing 150 books, with
double the number of clerks and cash takers, in
addition to an expensive mechanical device, in order
that the public can have facilities for wagering, this
page has no idea. It seems an altogether outrageous
excessiveness of facilitv.
**‘ * «
You can sum up what happened to all the
rest in the Derby by saying that Biplane just donkey-
licked them. With one exception, they arrived as
weary as a procession of curates returning from the
Sunday-school picnic. The exception looked very
much more expeditious than was really the case,
and, anyhow, had no more chance of winning than
of being elected to Parliament. AVhether Australia
possesses a colt up to Derby form can at best be
merely a matter of suspicion. But there was only
one genuine animal in Saturday’s race, and that was
the winner. Last year Maoriland sent over Kilboy.
This year Biplane comes along. The twin incident
is a cheerful circumstance for Australian breeders,
trainers, owners and other experts to reflect upon.
Kilboy, by an imported sire, was bred in Maori-
land. Biplane, a son of Comedy King, was foaled in
Victoria and removed as a yearling.
A queer aspect of the race as it turned out was
the despatch of Lord Windemere to make a solid
pace in the interests of Prince Viridis. Between this
and Biplane’s anxiety to make the pace for himself
the Prince was run off his legs. All the way round
Biplane was up with the leader, reaching out for his
head, and at the six furlongs post was by himself.
At the half-mile Prince Viridis moved up and turned
for the run home on the leader’s girths. Thrice, who
up till this stage was galloping well within himself,
was a length behind. But neither could foot it with
Biplane on the run home. Prince Viridis cracked
at the distance, and’Thrice was tiring badly. Inside
the half-distance Bronzetti came with a long run
from away back, and seemed to be going very fast;
but that was mainly because the Prince and Thrice
were stopping, and Biplane was easing off, with
nearly three lengths of daylight behind him and
them. A one-horse race. Thrice and the little ’un
had every chance, but the early stages of the per-
formance left them without a kick.
* * * *
The man in the grandstand discovered on
the second day when he piled his cash on Bronzetti
for the Clibborn Stakes, a mile and a furlong, that
the run in the Derby through a tiring field was
mainly spectacular. For this event Bronzetti was
made an even-money chance, and finished a poor
third to Pah King and Broken Glass. Both of these
nags ran badly in the Derby, Broken Glass particu-
larly so. Given better condition Bronzetti would
without a doubt have extended Biplane, but it was
a mistake to start him in either event. He had been
under a vet. for two or three weeks and practically
without work. Between now and the V.R.C. Derby
the colt may train on, but he was certainly a long
way from being fit to do his best at Randwick.
* * * *
Another long-priced ’un lobbed home in
the Epsom, an event which results in something sim-
ilar nine times out of 10. But there was no fluke
about Satin Bird’s win. He began quickly, was
promptly in. the_ fighting line, and stuck to what was
left of the job inside the distance like a tradesman.
Colugo had melted away when the direct run for
the line began, leaving Wedge just clear of Satin
Bird, Mehi King and Norbury. Norbury having
evaporated, Satin Bird reached the leader opposite
the Leger, and a few strides further on had him in
serious trouble, worrying him out of the stake by
a long head. Mehi King held his ground but finished
without a punch. It was hard luck for Wedge again.
The struggle in the Spring Stakes, in which Cetigne
beat him, probably lost him this race. He had gal-
loped in a rather slovenly way on the track in the
interval, and on Saturday seemed distinctly sore in
front. Satin Bird . tried him right out, and at the
end he was shifting badly. Ardrossan missed a
saloon passage, but was doing well with Sobrina at
the finish just behind the placed contingent. Nor-
bury, who had the call over everything in the betting,
found the proceedings too strenuous when the pinch
came. And so, dear brethren, once more is it
written where the names of Epsom winners are
recorded that something arrived while the crowd was
waiting for something else to happen.
It was a fine turn up for most of the bags, and
this mainly because of the construction placed on
recent exhibitions. Satin Bird had only been seen
out at Randwick two or three times last year. On
occasion he attracted notice to himself by showing
great gameness. When the weights for the Epsom
came out he was one of the first horses backed. Later
on Wedge floated in, and then came Tattersall’s and
the Rosehill meetings. In the Tramway Handicap
he finished fifth, behind Ardrossan, Auberic, Shrill
and Mehi King. In the Camellia Stakes, won by
Norbury from Snow King and Sweet Corn, he finished
seventh, petering out when well up at the distance.
This looked scarcely good enough to suggest much
confidence when the journey was further and equally
hasty methods were needed all the way. Wherefore
there were few inquiries about him and offers of
20 to 1 in Israel failed to provoke enthusiasm. In
some places his name was not written. On the
machine the price was 18 to 1. Wedge drifted in
the betting to B’s, being supposed to be stale. Snow
King was in continual demand at 7’s, principally
because of his showing with Norbury a week before.
As Snow King ran absolutely last and Wedge put up
a great race and Norbury failed to stay and Satin
Bird came on from where he chucked it before,
nearly everything was turned into hash.
But if form proved a poor guide to happenings in
the Epsom, the result of the Metropolitan was a
reminder that, on the whole, form is about the most
useful thing not to forget. On form there was abso-
lutely no warrant for expecting Court Jester to win.
Jle was favorite at C’s, due most probably to the
large quantity of talk there had been about him.
And although Wallace Isinglass had the recommenda-
tion of a win in a handicap at Tattersall's meeting
and at w.f.a. in the A.J.C. Spring Stakes on the
first day, the form of this animal when previously
sampled had been mostly in the direction of creating
pessimism. He was in next demand at 7’s, with
Fortune Hunter following. Now old Cagou had run two
good seconds just before to the last-named pair, and,
though handicap and weight-for-age form is always
hard to disentangle, there was quite as much reason
to look towards the ancient as a likely winner as
anything else. In point of condition he appeared
better than the others, and won in rare good style
the race he had previously appropriated four years
ago. Wallace Isinglass was never seriously in the
procession. The Fortune Hunter was outstayed, and
after Cetigne had been beaten off the sometimes
useful but never very brilliant Westcourt was left to
struggle in just too late. Lingle, who started at an
outside price, hurriedly came from away back, but
without sufficient impetus. He broke clear just a
second or so too late.
* * * *
Three starts at Randwick —and three sec-
onds. This record up to Monday of the Victorian
nag Wedge gets fairly close to the bad-luck record.
And to the stable and others the exasperating part
of the business was that on each occasion the horse
looked an almost certain winner just before being
overtaken by calamity.
* * * *
Has a Randwick trainer ever before
found, prior to the three big events of the A.J.C.
Spring meeting being run, that he had the favorite
for each race on the premises ? It happened to
James Barden this year. Prince Viridis, Norbury
and Wallace Isinglass were the shortest-priced horses
for these events on the night preceding each race.
And not one of them got a look in. »
* * * *
Every time that the winner of the A.J.C.
Spring Stakes looks almost a moral on paper for
the Metrop., old sports recall the case of Positano.
the imported horse. He won the w.f.a. race hand-
somely, and then appeared unbeatable for the Met.
with only 7st. 71b. to carry—2llb. less than his
w.f.a. burden. But Positano was already ripe for
the stud and he finished fifth.
D. H. HARVEY, of Tatt.’s and everything
else.
A punter may reasonably back the second
and third horses in the Metrop. for a win and place
in the Caulfield Cup. He is only backing the tip of
Precedent. In 1915 William the Silent ran second
m both races. St. Carwyne, in the previous year,
scored two thirds. In 1913 Aurifer won the Caul-
field event after being placed third for the Metrop.
Lady Medallist won it in 1911 after being runner-up
at Randwick. Piastre in 1912 took Melbourne Cup
under the same circs. In 1910 Flavinius ran third
for the Metrop. and first for the Caulfield Cup,
which was just what Maranui had done in 1908. In
1906 Poseidon scored a second and a first. Next
year Apologue ran a pair of seconds, the winner of
the Caulfield Cup being Poseidon again. Results for
the last 11 years make it out to be 5 to 2 on one of
the minor-placed nags in the Metrop. getting a place
at Caulfield, and only 6 to 5 against one of them
proving the actual winner of the latter event. Pre-
cedent is not an infallible tipster, by any means, but
he’s the best in the market a month before the race
* * * *
Lanius, imported, is shaping like a cham-
pion on the track at Caulfield, and a Melbourne Cup
victory is more than possible for this handsome
stranger. He is a big fellow, an aged one according
to Australian time, but only six and a half by Eng-
lish reckoning. Without having raced here yet
he appears to be thoroughly acclimatised and fairly
well forward in his predation. On paper he is not
unkindly handicapped at 9st. 41b. in the Caulfield
and 9st. 31b. in the Melbourne Cup, but the longer
race should be his dart, for he is a proved staver
He once gave a stone to Gadabout over 2J miles
and beat him easily over If mile at a difference of
91b. Between now and the first week in November
the possibilities of Robinson and Clark’s horse will
be tested in public, no doubt. But even though he
came “dark” to the barrier for Melbourne Cup he
would have a hopeful following.
* * * *
Sir Amyas is a former Cup fancy that
appears to have been blown out by his defeat on a
Melbourne suburban course. The imported nag per-
formed like a squib the other Saturday, so his chance
of staying 12 furlongs or more in the best handicap
company looks poor. All things considered, he
really had no pretensions to be labelled deadly. He
raced eight times in England, always in selling
races, without scoring a win, yet at 7st. £lb. he was
handicapped at 61b. more .than his half-brother
Lavendo carried in the Caulfield Cup two years ago.
The V.R.C. meeting on Saturday will
bring out some of the Victorian youngsters that are
credited with early promise. The Maribyrnong
Trial Stakes is often a very interesting scramble,
and this time it may put Tragic Star and others
to a more or less reliable test. The child of
Comedy King has done good sprints on the track
and should be equal to the trick.
* * * *
A suggestion of log-rolling in the recent
rearrangement of racing fixtures by Defence Minister
Pearce seems to be justified by one of his apologists.
The secretary for what are known as the John Wren
courses in Melbourne states: “The late Mr. John
Murray reduced the pony-club meetings from 48 to
36. Mr. McLeod, the present Chief Secretary, fur-
ther cut them down from 36 to 15, so that instead
of 46 week-days and two Saturdays, as before the
war, the three pony clubs now have 15 days and no
Saturdays.” Murray, by the way, reduced the num-
ber of meetings before the war. But let
that pass. The new Federal scheme pro-
vides that John Wren proprietary courses shall
st|3l get 15 days’ racing, l.' t of which shall
he Saturdays. And three of those are to be
“free” Saturdays, when the proprietary club will
suffer no opposition from a club that devotes its
profits to patriotic funds. But while the Federal
Government “reform” leaves the precious erock-and-
pony meetings of John Wren as numerous as they
were, it deletes one day each from, the V.R.C. and
V.A.T.C. programmes, and two days from the A.J.C.,
thus robbing the patriotic funds of some thousands
of pounds. The chairman of the V.A.T.C., in ex-
pressing the committee’s astonishment at Minister
Pearce’s policy of “judicious reductions” in horse
racing, estimated the loss to the patriotic funds at
£5OOO to £8000; also he said that the granting of
three “free” Saturdays per annum to the unregis-
tered clubs was “remarkable.”
Plainly speaking, it is not remarkable. It is
just about what might have been expected by any
cynical citizen who notes that a paltry w-ooden
shelter for recruiting-speechmakers outside Melbourne
Town Hall bears the conspicuous announcement,
“Erected by John Wren, Esq.,” which is a scan-
dalous advertisement for the ponv-meeting boss, any-
how. Furthermore, the same Wren is now
getting persistent advertisement as a sweep promoter
and benefactor in connection with St. Vincent’s
Hospital. If a certain number of shilling picture
tickets are sold for the benefit of the Hospital one
of them is to draw a prize of £lOOO donated by
J. Wren, Esq., aforesaid, and in the event of a very
unlikely number of tickets being placed with “bob”
investors he is advertised to make the winning ticket
worth £6OOO. If the Town Hall can be so easily
worked for the glorification of Wren’s name, and the
law can be stretched to permit of him being identi-
fied with a lottery, there is nothing remarkable, in
the new race-meeting regulations that Pearce is
administering.
Nor was the recent Show Week scandal remark-
able. McLeod, the Vic. Chief Secretary, performed
what the Age bluntly described as a “Ministerial
trick” in favor of John Wren. In years gone by
the Agricultural Show Society complained that a
pony meeting at Ascot was permitted on Show holi-
day. Last year McLeod undertook to consider the
Society’s grievance, and after a lot of quibbling he
promised a deputation that- its wishes would be
met. As recently as August last the Society was
assured that no pony meeting would be held at
Ascot on Show holiday. Here is where the trick
came in. The usual meeting was not held at Ascot,
but at John Wren’s other course—Richmond! The
Society’s grievance remained. The scene of it was
changed. Wren, who used to be known as “The
Law Breaker” in the days of his Collingwood Tote
and Bourke-street betting club, is now thought of as
“The Log Roller.”

Broken Hill champion Jim Millerick
journeyed to Sydney to interview Jack Hilt, the
understanding being that the survivor should be
matched with _ Uren. The conversation was staged
at the temple in Rushcutter’s Bay on Saturday. The
stranger turned out to be a rusher armed with a
violent smite that is mostly out of control, and
wide open to injurious intervention. A rough, scram-
bling disturbance ensued, and James, having worn
himself out and been heavily pasted in the 10th,
got the smack of perfect peace immediately after re-
suming. In the kindliest possible spirit this page
would _ advise the hefty Jim to start from the
beginning or stick to woodenin’ ’em up at the

“G. Arden Hill”: On a recent Saturday
at Port Kembla (N.S.W.) a team of local aboriginals
opposed the pick of the white population in a Rugby
contest. The game was spectacular rather than
scientific. The blacks made the pace lively from
the whistle, and excelled in open play: thev were
weak in the serums owing to an hereditarv'regard
for their shin-bones. At one stage, when a sombre
streak was flashing along the line, an opponent
attempted to tackle low, but onlv succeeded in
detaching the fugitive’s pants. Undaunted and
unashamed the abo. sped on and registered a trv.
Then while one of his mates kicked a goal the others
surrounded him and effected repairs. The dusky side
won by 16 to 12. They came from the field with
their shirts in ribbons, but their features decorated
with an expansive smile.

But the depreciation reserve is £13,821; and
it the ship and other property is worth that
much less than it was in 1912, when the pre-
sent co. took it over, then actually the co.
has no reserves at all. If the additions to
this depreciation reserve are cut out, then
the profit year by year has been as follows:
1913 .. x 570 | 1916 .. £933
1914 .. 1499 | 1919 (Loss) 1658
1915 ... 813 |
The difference between some of these figures
and those in the first table is very remark-
able. In 1914, for instance, no less than
£7275 was added to depreciation account;
and that looks an extraordinary figure seeing
that the steamer property at the beginning
of 1913 was valued at only £21,500, and pre-
sumably it had been taken over at something
like its true value only a couple of years
before. So far as the history of the co. in a
general way is concerned much therefore
depends upon whether merely a fair thing has
been written off profits against wear and
tear.
Since 1914 there have been no additions
to the fleet; and this is how the position has
changed in those three years:—
1914. 1917.
Steamer property . . . . £39,538 £39,538
Freehold and wharf property .. 4,638 9,341
Other assets . . . . . . 1,221 1,415
Liabilities . . . . . . 18,876 21,862
So, as a set-off against an increase of
£2986 in the liabilities, the co. has £4703
more in wharf property and £194 more in
sundries. Meantime it has paid a couple of
6 p.c. dividends and has attended to current
renewals and repairs, including the over-
haul of one of the steamers. There is cer-
tainly nothing at all fat in that; indeed it is
extremely doubtful whether . the trifle put
into wharf property in excess of the extra
amount borrowed has counterbalanced the
general depreciation of steamers. In other
words, it is very doubtful whether in the
past three years a dividend averaging 4 p.c.
has been truly earned. As compared with
1914 wages are now 40 p.c. higher, and pro-
bably the stores bill (coal, etc.) is nearly
as much more. On the other side, whether
the traffic has been even maintained is very
doubtful. The co., finding that something
had to be done, has lately put up fares. This
may enable it to get on an even keel again;
but it doesn’t promise to put much gilt on
the co.’s gingerbread. The co. never did look
as though it might do great things; so far
as regular traffic is concerned it picks up
only a little that the direct tram to the city
misses, and for even that little it is now in
competition with the Sydney Ferries, which
has lately pushed across to the south side of
the Harbor. For the rest there is an irregu-
lar “tripper” traffic, and that is only the
crumbs that the Manly co. misses. So,
though it is an unouestionable public con-
venience, it isn’t one that is at all likely to
get fat on the proceeds.

I rade is all right, the directors say; but
costs are high and profits in consequence
small. Mostly when six-o’clock closing
arrived the breweries cracked hardy and
suggested that the people were now taking
home more in bottles than they formerly
carried home in their waistcoats. But they
had to drop that bluff when pub lessees
crowded into the courts applying under the
new law for a reduction of rent. However, this
co. has a second string to its bow. Hobart,
the most antarctic capital city in the British
Empire, has certain natural advantages for
brewing; and gradually it is pushing its
Polar beer into the Australian and overseas
markets. This trade, according to new chair-
man Grant, who has replaced the lately-
deceased Fitz Gerald, “shows a steady in-
crease.”,
The result of a mere 6 p.c. div. and a lot of
patient plodding has been a steady reduction
of the heavy debt which sits on the co.’s
chest. Five years’ history :

partly through getting in book debts, which
are now exceptionally small, though no
smaller than they should be in a trade in

stocks and which he gets rid of almost
always for cash.

Simple and Effective Methods.

London, Eng.
To Kill Roots of Superfluous Hair.
Women annoyed with disfiguring growths
of superfluous hair wish to know not merely
how to temporarily remove the hair, but how
to kill the hair roots permanently. For this
purpose pure powdered pliemiuol inav be
applied directly to the objectionable hair-
growth. * The recommended treatment is
designed not only to instantly remove the
hair, but to actually kill the roots so that
the growth will not return. About an ounce
of pheminol, obtainable from the chemist,
should be sufficient.
Removing Her Skin.
The quickest and surest way to make a
good complexion out of a bad one is to
actually remove the thin veil of faded or dis-
colored outer skin from the face. This can
be done easily, safely and privately by any
woman. The process is one of gentle absorp-
tion.
Get some pure mercolised wax from your
chemist and apply it at night like cold cream,
washing it oft' in the morning. In a few
days the mercolide in the wax will have
absorbed the disfiguring cuticle, revealing
the fresh young skin underneath; you will
have a beautiful, clear, natural complexion.
The process is pleasant and harmless, making
the face look brilliantly attractive and youth-
ful. It also effectually removes such blem-
ishes as freckles, tan, moth patches, liver
spots, pimples, etc. Every woman should
keep a little mercolised wax on hand, as this
simple, old-fashioned remedy is the best com-
plexioned beautifier and preserver known.
Blackheads Instantly Go.
A very simple, harmless and pleasant pro-
cess is now used to remove blackheads and
correct greasiness and large pores in the
skin. You have only to drop a tablet of
stymol, obtained from the chemist, into a
glass of hot water and bathe the face with
the liquid after the effervescence has sub-
sided. The blackheads will then come right
off on the towel. The enlarged pores immedi-
ately contract to normal and the greasiness
disappears, leaving the skin smooth, soft and
cool and free from blemish. But to make sure
that this desirable result is permanent it is
advisable to repeat the treatment several
times at intervals of say about four or five
days.
Grey Hair Unnecessary.
One need not resort to the very question-
able expedient of hair dye in order not to
have grey hair. The grey hair can easily be
changed back to a natdral color in a "few
days time merely by the application of a
simple, old-fashioned and perfectly harmless
home-made lotion. Procure from your chem-
ist two ounces of tammalite concentrate and
mix it with three ounces of bay rum. Apply
this to the hair a few times with a smail
sponge, and you will soon have the pleasure
of seeing your grey hair gradually darkening
to the desired shade. The lotion is pleasant
not sticky or greasy, and does not injure the
hair in any way.
Naturally Wavy Hair.
Good stallax not only makes the best possi-
ble shampoo, but has the peculiar property of
leaving the lmir with a pronounced natural
wave, an effect presumably desired bv many
ladies. A teaspoonful of the stallax granules,
dissolved in a cup of hot water, is ample for
a luxurious head wash, and leaves the hair
with a peculiar lustre and fluffiness obtainable
from nothing else as far as known. It is per-
fectly harmless, and can be obtained from
most chemists, although since it has been but
little used for this purpose it comes only in
j lb. sealed original packages, enough to make
up 25 or 30 individual shampoos. [2

. . . .J.E.F. (S. Africa): Merely a string of plati-
tudes. ... B.K. (India): Thanks; good luck.... Dor’s
Dad: Glad somebody knew what he meant. .. .303:
Returning copy; might interest the other paper....
The Mad Motorist: Verses should have reached you
by now if they haven't been arrested.... Vale: Keel
better now? V.: A. E. Strahan (Batlow, N.S.W.)
says he will cure your dog' if you write to him. . . .
M.H.L.: “Son of His Country” not our style....
Eavesdropper: Doesn't work C.R.: The verse is
a calamity... .S.M.: “Liverpool” joys don't appeal.
S.C.R.: In spite of its truth it doesn’t make a
story.... Seedy: Verse very flimsy and ideas about
as fresh as the ventilation of Noah's ark....
W.E.B.: Very lame stuff J.E.: “The Storm”
doesn’t sweep us along with it.... A.B.: We won’t
acknowledge any brotherhood of man that compels
us to endure verse like that M.B.P.: Won’t do.
.. .. E.C.: “Love in September” is slovenly stuff,
but has some points J.E.O.T.: We accept poetry
and good verse. What you send is not acceptable.
. ...R.B.C.: It didn’t tickle us to death. In fact,
it failed to work even a tolerant smile.,..
J.H.C.S.: No use. .. .C.E.S.: Not a glimmer in it.
• Westburm: Poor E. J.G.: Not much thrill
in those snakes E.IL : No value J.M.M.: You
are verjfc slight—-and disgustingly superior. . . .
I5.G.H.: “Ends and Means” goes heavily... .T.C.:
“Not Proven” won’t do.. ..E.L.: Not our style....
Augur: First attempt is a bit dull. Send us the
thirty-first.... E.AI.F.: You don’t contrive to make
“Resurrection” convincing.... Smaillijive: Null and
void... . A.R.G.: “Aviators” are wooden.... H.J.W.:
Nothing in it Brad: Too slight L.B.: There's
no meat in it. .. .F.S.M.: Not bad; but it hasn’t the
touch a little thing like that needs. . . .C.J.W.-.
Mostly noise. .. .E.W.D.: If you would stop trying
for fine writing and get more heart into it you
would do better....G.B.H.: Ideas all right, but
verse doesn't carry them. .. .Sirius (or something
that looks like it) : “The Bloomin’ Navy” doesn’t
shine in your illumination Truthful James: Obvi-
ous sort of yarn without skill or thrill J.K.:
Feeble little flutter R.F.: Lumpy thing's that
shuffle along and sometimes after a big bump shout
a commonplace very loudly. .. .D.L.B.: No. . . .R.A.:
“Parson” yarn insane. “Shed” of no general in-

hope for verse eked out with the word “sir” at the
end of every second line. .. .K.L.: Durban verse was

nerve. You have been invited to produce a picture
play, and you send us a postcard asking how to
write it. Do it legibly in ink.... J.D.B.: “Alphabet
Rhymes” rejected with explosive curses.... Miserere:
Wrong. She wasn't born then. . . .E.R.A.:'Nothing. . . .
Lantana : Sorry, if we were wrong. Some of the phras-
ing looked exceedingly modern for a diary supposed
th be written at that time. .. .Enrobso: Pars, must be
of much wider interest. The rechristening of a
“little settlement” in the Tweed River district for
the reason given would bore the man at Cairns and
make the constant Christian at Kimberley commence
his prayers an hour earlier than usual. .. .W.P.N.:
Can't use that. Something might be done in Mel-
bourne. Will see.... Private Enterprise : Batman is
English. Related to the word bathorse—the nag
that in the old days carried an officer’s baggage. . . .
M .M.C.: No; but you might be able to place it
elsewhere.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.

use the thin-man joke, and your drawing is shaky
all the time. . . .F.L.Y.: No trousers or beer to-day,
thank you... . G.McD.: Fearfully and wonderfully
crude J.D.B.: That lift gag again! D.S.G.:
Improve your drawing or perish C.T.F.: Better
get your artistic boots soled. You’ve a long way
to travel yet... .I.V.K.: How did the enginedriver
get his large head through the small cab window?
And how is he going to get it back again when he
has finished bandying words \\;ith the striker by the
line?. .. .R.H.R.: You’ve invented the most horri-
ble small boy of the season. .. .Woodicus: Struggle
on.... L.G.: You must study swaggies if you want
to draw them S.D.: Sorry unsuitable.... R.K.:
A stone axe is the only remedy for such jokers....
X.Q.S.: No, it isn’t'. . . . I.V.G.: Too black altogether.
A.E.K.: If he is interested buy him the best
tuition available. But equally good work comes in
regularly from young beginners.
Candidates are falling over one another to
grab Laborite Tom Tnnnecliffe’s Eaglehawk
seat in the Vie. Assembly. The Farmers’
Onion, which is going liot-foot after a whole
lot of State seats, is putting up farmer \Y.
C. Hill, of Colbinabbin. president of the
concern. “Bill” Richards, who let Hughes
climb over his shoulders into the Bendigo
seat, has entered for the Liberal pre-election,
and Thomas Hicks, a well-gilded local-poli-
tician with considerable bazaar-opening ex-
perience and a member of the National Fed-
eration. is going to the poll, anyway. The
case looks rather blue for Tunnecliffe;
but official Labor is more inclined to worry
than Thomas himself.
The worst of a falling out in a family is
that each faction knows just where to flick
the other. Edwards, one of the few Labor
men left in the S. Aus. Assembly, makes a
specialty of asking awkward questions about
the free use of Government motor-cars by
his late friends, the Vaughan Ministry, half
of whom are now in the Peake Ministry.
Also, questions are frequent in the House
about the odd sort of Commission of Inquiry
into the heavy land-purchases of Vaughan
and his colleagues. Incidentally, Edwards
cited the “example” set by Griffith, of N. S.
Wales, in resigning his portfolio while the
Petrol inquiry was going on, and suggested
that the S.A. coalitionists concerned in the
land purchases might do the same. Peake
replied that the cases are not analogous, and
in that he is right. But he might have
replied much more effectively that Griffith
didn't resign.

Anaemia
Our blood is composed of
red and white corpuscles
the red to nourish the body,
the white to fight disease. In
Anaemia—or bloodlessness—
the red corpuscles are more
or less deficient. Thus the
blood cannot provide suffi-
cient nourishment for the
body. Therefore the face
becomes white and “ pasty ”
—the eyes become dull and
Xl heavy”—and a feeling of
intense weariness pervades
the whole system. To over-
come Anaemia, the blood
supply needs recharging with
red corpuscles. And it is
here that
The Wine of Life
possesses such wonderful
power. Because, being a
blood - maker, ‘Wincarnis’
creates a wealth of new rich,
red blood, which brings the
roses back to the cheeks—
gives a sparkle to the eyes—
and surcharges the whole
body with new vitality and
new life. That is why over
10,000 Doctors recommend
‘ Wincarnis.’

IN BANANA LAND
“Yalguu”: Ever hear of a black man
turning white? Tim Plummer, erstwhile
prospector, buckjump rider and bushworkcr
who answered the call a few days ago in
the hospital in Stanthorpe. did the trick.
Seventy years ago lje came into the world
at Pikedale as black as any otiier
aborigine, and remained so until be reached
middle age, when patches of white appeared
on his skin. These spread until at the tme
of his death from pneumonia it was impos-
sible to detect any “black’ blood in his
make-up.
“Chevron” : From private to lieut.-co’onel,
with a D.S.O. and a D.C.M. to his credit,
is the record of a former Queenslander, now
31, Maurice Wilder-Neligan. Enlisting on
August 20, 1914, he w T on the D.C.M. as a
sergeant in Gallipoli, and was promoted
second lieut. three days after the Landing.
His battalion w 7 as the 9th, which is generally
admitted to have been the first by a few
seconds to set foot on the Turkish shore.
Full captain in March, 1916, he justified his
promotion four months later when he led
four officers and 144 men on a night raid on
the Hun trenches in France. Fifty-three
Huns were killed and 24 made prisoners. A
machine-gun was brought back, and another
machine-gun and a trench mortar destroyed.
The raiders lost an officer and six men. with
26 wounded. Wilder-Neligan acquired one
of the wrnunds and the D. 5.0.; Lieut. H. T.
Young a wound, four prisoners, the
machine-gun and the Military Cross;
Lieut. J. P. Ramkema the M.C. and a
wound. Lieut. C. E. Benson, w 7 ho had won
the D.C.M. in Gallipoli, lost his life. The
united age of the four was 117 years.
Wilder-Neligan became a major in the fol-
lowing October, and w 7 as mentioned in Haig’s
despatches in November. On June 30 last
he was promoted lieut.-colonel, and given
command of the Tenth Battalion, in succes-
sion to Lieut.-Col. Jacob.
“W.A.M.”: “The Lamb” (B. 20/9/’l7)
w 7 as certainly doing his Victorian lodge dis-
pensing cheaply at ss. per head per annum :
but all chemists are not so generous. At
Maryborough fQ.) the chemists pushed the
charge up to 10s. bd., and protested that
there was nothing in it even at that figure.
Then one of the businesses changed hands
and the new man cheerfully entered into a
five years’ contract wit' all the lodges to
dispense for 75., with a promise of a reduc-
tion at the termination of the war. That’s
more than a year ago, and so far he has not
filed his schedule.
“Coolibah”: “O’Roo” (B. G/9/’l7) is
about right w’lien he says Brisbane's water-
supply is the dirtiest in Australia. The
city is unfortunately situated as regards
good sites for gravitation services; the
few available with sufficient elevation being
too distant and too costly for present re-
quirements. Last year during the dry spell
gangs of men were employed in the upper
reaches of the river above the pumping
station at Mt. Crosby cutting channels from
waterhole to waterhole to keep the river
flowing, and Brisbane citizens got w 7 hat
more resembled peasoup than water. To
augment the supply in the river during dry
stretches the Cabbage Tree Creek dam was
built at a cost of £172,000. It was com-
menced in July, 1912, and finished in Decem-
ber last year. It is one of the biggest struc-
tures of its kind in Australia, and holds
hack, when full, 5800 million gallons of
w r ater, or about six months’ supply for Bris-

bane. The catchment area is 28 square
miles. After two years’ storing the reser-
voir is just about full, but so far there has
been no necessity to draw 7 on this supply.
In conjunction with the dam a new service
reservoir of 4,600,000 gallons and filtration
beds are under construction at Crosby, to he
ready for use in about a year. Then for a
few years, at least, Brisbaneites will have
less excuse for beer. As the city expands,
more provision still must be found. No doubt
the upper Logan River will then supply a
gravitation service.
“P.E.G.”: Prickly-pear, growing between
Gogango and Westwood, Central Banana-
land, has developed a rather strange rot or
disease. The pear gradually withers and
finally dies right down to the roots, and if
the dead stuff is disturbed large numbers of
small bluish-w’hite insects arise from it.
The proposed sale at an early date of the
A.U.S.N. Co.’s lightering plant at Rock-
hampton marks the last of a cumbersome
and slow service that formerly connected
Rocky w r ith the coastal traffic. The service
was carried on for many years with the tw T o
tenders Dolphin and Taldora. The Taldora
was sent to Brisbane some years ago, but
the Dolphin forms part of the plant to be
put under the hammer. The passenger and
cargo traffic now go by rail from Port Alma.
Son o’ Mine.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
O son of mine, with blue eyes full of light,
So splendid in your youth, so brown and tall,
To think that you must go from me to fight,
And —who knows, sonny?—in the fight to
fall!
The tiny son that came so frail and lone,
The soldier-boy that smiles dowm from his
height—■
I see no difference. You are still mine own,
And as my baby you go forth to fight.
I could not stay you though my heart should
break,
For I have looked into your eyes and read
The glance that tells me Honor is at stake,
And you must follow on where others led;
While I must stay at home, and hope and
pray,
And do the common task that near me lies;
And I must laugh to keep the tears away,
Not knowing if my soldier lives or dies.
I’ll try for your sake to be brave, my son,
To bear my loneliness and hide my paiu,
Till War is over and our Cause is won.
And you. with your ghid laugh, come home
again.
But, darling, should this be our last good-
bye,
And should your life-blood stain the soil of
France,
Then God may let you see me as you die.
And feel my kiss upon your brow perchance!

My Dear Tiiargomindah,—
At the Wynnum Agricultural Show the
other day Governor Goold-Adams told the
poultry-farmers that he had a warm spot
for Rhode Island Reds, settings of which
he sells at a guinea a bunch for the beneht
of the Red Cross. His Ex. doesn t trade
the sittings from a harrow, but there is. no
difficulty in getting the potential chickens.
A ’phone ring and a guinea to the Red Cioss
will make a bargain.
A bomb was thrown this week into our
sinless community by Dr. Thelander. It
was addressed to the committee of the Resi-
dential Club and demanded an inquiry into
the management of a stall run at the Ex-
hibition during Show Week. The doctor
sent copies of the letter to the press, and
an agitated public has its suspicions that
much-needed profit has skipped by the light
of the moon.
Home Secretary Huxham and his wife,
the Bunnyskins of Brisbane, and various
other picnickers will represent our village
at the Town Planning Conference in
Adelaide.
Died this week, aged 81, Stephen Lawm,
from whom Lawnton got its name. He
landed from Yorkshire in ISG2.
Another pioneer slipped away this week —
Mrs. Crawford Simpson, aged 86. In 1866
she escaped from Scotland and, after resid-
ing at our Oxley for a few years, settled iu
Stanthorpe.
Mrs. Kathleen Watson Dearden. novelist,
has staying with her Lt.-Col. Watson, a
brother attached to the Indian Medical Ser-
vice. He is convalescing after a strenuous
time in Mesopotamia.
Two engagements for your private ear:
(1) Lieut. Pacey, late of the 2nd Light Horse,
and Miss Pamela Prout, of Beaudesert;
(2) Lance Butler, general manager of
Butler and Sons, Brisbane, and Miss Gladys
Hooten, daughter of the Hootens of Oonoo-
dooroo.
Mr. and Mrs. J. S. Badger, who have
been enjoying themselves in Uncle Sam’s
dominion for eight months, have returned to
the better land.
G. W. Whatmore, his two brothers from
Sydney, and Sid Isles left Brisbane this
week per motor for the Gulf. They intend
to traverse the coast to Townsville, then
strike west via Charters Towers to Clon-
curry. thence northerly to the source of the
Leichhardt River and on to Carpentaria.
The overlanders reckon to do the trip of
4000 miles in a month or five weeks.
The Correspondence Club has opened a

bane Police Court alone heard over 200 dis-
puted claims. The State Insurance Office
now has a monopoly of the business, and a
dissatisfied applicant has the right to take
his claim before an Industrial Referee. Last
year there was not one contested claim
Only on points of law are appeals permitted
to the Supreme Court, and then counsel may
not appear.
One of the very first claims that Banana-
land’s Insurance Office yvas for
compensation in the case of a carter who
had been killed in the employ of a small
cocky. The cocky had, however, failed to
insure ; and under the old Act would have
been liable for the full amount of compensa-
tion. He was the most surprised bird in the
State when a lenient Dept, informed him
that, seeing that compulsory insurance
had been in force only a few days, the Dept,
would pay the £432 due if he sent along
his overdue premium. Another case during
the year was that of an insured workman
who crossed into N. S. Wales on his em-
ployer’s business and was killed. Legally
there could be 110 valid claim; but the Dept,
did the humane thing and handed the widow
and youngsters its cheque for £4OO.
The Ryan Government has sent Major
Mick Shanahan, D.S.O , to tell British and
Allied soldiers about the facilities that
Banaualand offers for the settlement of ex-
service men. The Shanahans are well-known
settlers in the Maranoa district. Mick set
out as lieut. in the Light Horse to keep
Abdul in check, and he earned the D.S.O.
at Romani for rescuing one of his men under
fire. It cost him a leg. After seeming a
substitute for the missing prong in London,
he is going to have a shot for the Flying
Corps.

Both Series “18” Studebaker FOUR and Series “18” Studebaker
SIX are noted for their great power, and especially their great power in ratio
to their very low consumption of petrol.
It has taken Studebaker four years to improve, refine and perfect the
wonderful Studebaker motor. It has been solved through the experience of
250,000 cars in the hands of owners. It is only through an evolution like
this that perfection of power in ratio to fuel consumption can possibly be
developed.
There' are no secret processes ; no basic patents ; no features of design
that are unknown or prohibited by patents. Ihe Engineer can use what he
wishes, but he can only know how to use the best fcntui es by continually'
improving, refining and perfecting —through the experience of a motoi m
actual service.
This is why Studebaker can truthfully claim that the design of its motor
is unsurpassed in simplicity, accessibility and power. By the refinement of
reciprocating parts, vibration has been reduced to an almost unobservable
minimum.
The bearing areas of the motor have been enlarged and increased, giving
o-reater durability, more strength, still further insuring smooth, vibrationless
operation.
But you cannot appreciate the splendid POW ER of the Studebaker
car until you TRY it.

Albert’s Grasshopper Ointment
The proprietors of this 50-year old remedy for skin
and blood ailments have an absolute confidence in
its unsurpassed virtues. They believe it to be a
safe and perfect cure for these ailments; they know
it to be; and the vast number of testimonials
received prove it to be. It positively draws the
poisons which produce these ailments out of the
system. As an aperient and blood purifier the
Grasshopper Pills are equally effective, and should
be taken in conjunction with the Ointment. Sold
by all Stores ana Chemists, and stocked by ail the
\Yb jsale Houses in the Commonwealth.
When the Nerves Fail
Pitiful is the cry that comes from men
and women victims of Neurasthenia, the
“twentieth century complaint” that has
arisen out of the competition, speed and
worry of the age. Medical evidence proves
that Neurasthenia is getting more and more
serious, attacking even very young persons.
Seldom do two sufferers experience symp-
toms alike, but all more or less endure a
feeling of misery day and night, lack of
appetite, morbid thoughts, exhaustion after
slight exertion, neuralgic pains, indigestion,
headaches, insomnia, and “dead-tired” limbs.
A great number of sufferers have found
benefit from Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills, this
treatment being based on the fact that
nerve troubles arise from poor blood. These
pills refresh the weak nerves with a nutri-
tive stream of new blood; thus the nerves
are reinforced with the elements they lack,
and the nervous trouble is dispelled. Dr.
Williams’ Pink Pills are a valuable blood-
tonic, and of the greatest assistance in
troubles arising from starved and distressed
nerves.
Get a supply from any dealer to-day and

substitutes.

Melbourne City Council has called upon
citizens to refrain from crossing streets
diagonally. The recommendation is about to
be framed in a by-law. It looks like a subtle
method of enforcing prohibition.
“Ivan F.”: The sectarian beetle doesn't
thrive in the real Australia. At Ivoora-
watha (N.S.W.) the local Anglican cemetery
badly wanted cleaning up, so rector Tivey
got his men’s club together and arranged a
working party for a Saturday afternoon.
When Father Keating and the Hibernian
Society heard of the scheme they knew it
would be a big job, and that the laborers
were few ; so they rolled up, too, and gave
the Anglicans a hand. But it’s a dangerous
precedent: if they work together, they’ll be
praying together next.
“Padjud”: Re “Condenser’s” claim (B.
IG/8/T7) that there is no gap worth worry-
ing about in the daylight wireless chain
between Sydney and Melbourne. Sydney
station commonly loses south-bound ves-
sels long before they reach Gabo—approxi-
mately about Bateman’s Bay. Using the
power set, I also have worked traffic to Mel-
bourne and Sydney from Gabo, but only once
in about 30 tries. Reduced to the emer-
gency set on which a ship in trouble mostly
has to depend, there wouldn't be an earthly
chance of “reaching” either station. Two and
a half years ago the burning Norfolk, though
considerably west of Gabo, alid able to use
her. power set. was quite unable to “reach"
Melboufhe*’uhtil that station's! attention was
dratyn to lrqr- distress-call liy the better-
placed Indarra. k Even then, with Mel-
bourne’s receiving? gear at concert pitch, the
Norfolk’s signals kept fading out. and the
Indarra’s operator Jhad to stand by to relay
when required. . r ”
“0.1 v.” : The ’other morning a volub).e_g.uy
W’ith a Yankee accent called with a tract,
lie mentioned in brisk, commercial ’Murkan
manner that the im-mortal spirret was a thing
to be con-sidered in the light of the little
bit of printin’ he was leavin’ for my pe-rusal.
So I guessed and calculated that a new pro-
phet was on the warpath, and hoped it might
be Adela Panklvurst. But no! He turned
out to be only a Mormon publicity agent
whose tract was all about Joe Smith, with
never a word concerning plurality of wives.
.Toe, it seems, was kneeling to pray in the
year a.d. 1820, when “lie saw two glorious
personages, whose brightness and glory it is
impossible to describe, standing above him
in the air.” He appealed for. guidance as re-
gards sectarian selection, and was told to
start a sect of his own. because none of the
ones in vogue were worth a doughnut. That’s
how he came to start the Latter Day Saints
and give my friend the publicity-agent a job.
“Hamer” is impressed :
Mrs. John Bjill and Miss Bull, not to mention the
juvenile members of the family, are doing their share
of war work, and don’t you doubt it. None of the
stories told about the employment of women had pre-
pared me for the actual thing. In a train journey tak-
ing the greater part of a day I saw not only female
porters, drivers and cleaners (many' of them in
trousers and overalls), but a party of them harvest-
ing at 8.30 p.m. Even in the Army Service there are
women driving ambulance waggons and looking smart
in uniforms. In a case concerning school non-attend-
ance of a 13-year-old boy the evidence showed that
he was hard at work making munitions l : (Dad was
at the Front.) The boy was earning £2 16s. per
week, so he apparently wasn’t loafing on the job. One
young eligible certainly did put in an appearance at
a wayside station as the troop train was passing, and
bore stolidly the scoffs of the girl porters, who ex-
plained that he was “a coward objector,” and
clamored to us: “What do you think of fighting for
the likes of that?” It takes some courage to be a
conscientious objector in England these days. But
it might take more not to be.
A Melbourne paper,, possibly with a view
to raising a public disturbance in its
columns, asks : “What is the worst feature of
married life?” It all depends. Possibly the
wife; perhaps the husband.
Richard Thomas Disney O’Halloran,
Labor candidate, just defeated for the Mur-,
ray (N.S.W.), is an ex-bank clerk given
to flaunting initials and assessing his own
ability generously. He was one of the num-
ber that worked the censure motion on the
Holman Government at the 1916 conference,
and. remaining a member of the new section,
was soon hailed as the pure merino enthusi-
ast who journeyed regularly from the River-
ina to Sydney to take part in the Sunday-
afternoon confabs of the junta—as Hughes
called it. Anyhow, this not the way to
get votes West o’ Darling. A better plan
wouM be to shed letters and high collars and
knock round the spacious electorate doing a
bit of real work, like Bob Scobie did.
There were two Howards with Jacka,
V.CL when he won the first of the three
decorations he now holds, and both have
seen more than one term of service. Cor-
poral W. D. Howard, a Bendigo lad; is a
prisoner in Germany, having gone to the
French Front after being invalided home
from Gallipoli. The other, Sergeant Charles
Howard, better known in his native Welsh-
pool (Wales) as Lukey, went through the
Boer War with an Australian contingent,
and liked the company so well that he again
enlisted wffien the Kaiser broke loose, and
was at the Landing. He was twice wounded
in France, where he was a pal of Sergeant
J. W. Whittle, the Tasmanian Y.C. Dis-
charged. he returned to Australia, and then
took his wife and child on a visit to Wales,
where he was receiving press notices wffien
the mail closed. He was mentioned in lan
Hamilton’s despatches, and has survived
being posted as killed in action.
The old yarn about an unaccountable sen-
try maintained in one corner of a royal park
is revived in a new serious book on National
Economy, and declared to be literally true.
The sentry was found, when some disloyal
person pressed for inquiry, to have been
placed there about 70 years before to guard
a rose-bush wffiich the Empress of the day
happened to admire. That w r as in Russia.
But Britain had its rose-bush. too. In the
India accounts a round sum used to be voted
every year for “a Mrs. Gordon.” Subordi-
nates talked scandal over this for about half
a century ; then it was found to be a clerical
error for “Amir’s garden.” Amir and gar-
den were both long dead ; but the grant had
gone on.


STOP AIN
A BOON TO MOTHERS.
After much thought and experiment
we have at last succeeded in completing
what we believe is the most successful
treatment known for toothache. We
have placed it on the market under the
name of
STOPAIN
A Toothache Gum.
Besides being the latest and most
successful treatment for toothache,
Stopain is both simple and economical,
It is in the form of a gum and all you
have to do is to fill the cavitv of the
tooth with it. It excludes the air and
stops toothache immediately.
No more burnt gums or blistered
tongues by liquid cures ” and this
alone means a lot to mothers.
Not only does Stopain relieve the pain,
but it also assists to preserve the tooth
until dental aid can be obtained, thus
making it invaluable to families in the
country who are often a day’s journey
from the nearest dentist.
Stopain is a boon to mothers. No
home should be without Stopain ; it is so
convenient and never fails to bring relief.
Stopain has been tried bv thousands of
people and we have never yet known it
to fail when used according to directions.
Get it now for you never know when it
may be needed.
Stopain is sold by most retailers at Is.
per box, but if yours hasn't got it in
stock it will be sent, to any address
postage paid, upon receipt of price by
SUNSET DRUG CO.,
Cr. Goodlet & Riley Streets, Sydney.

you have tried everything else for corns—
applied in two seconds, and if it does
not cure your corns we will refund your
money.
If you have ever made a fat bundle of
vour toes with bandages ; used thick,
corn pressing rings ; corn pulling salves
or liquid medicines that took off more
toe than corn—-well, you will appreciate
Handy Corn Cure. Try Handy Corn
Cure for any corn, callous, wart or
bunion. It never fails.

At Jennie’s first attack of croup I was absolutely terrified
for a few moments. I cannot tell you how it grieved me to listen to the choking cough
and watch her gasping for breath, but I quickly found that there is no need for alarm
when one uses Chamberlain’s Cough Remedy. You know with croup a false membrane
forms in the throat; until this is removed the choking continues.
Chamberlain’s Cough Remedy
loosens this membrane and causes the child
to expel it by vomiting.
Chamberlain’s Cough Remedy is a safe
and certain remedy for croup and if given
as soon as the child becomes hoarse, or
even after the croupy cough appears, it
will prevent the attack.
When I think of the many times this
medicine has saved me the unnecessary
expense of a doctor’s bill I don’t wonder that
it is used in so many thousands of homes.
L" Nov be sure

Chamberlain s'*
DID YOU KNOW
That the manufacturers of Chamberlain’s Cough Remedy, which is the
largest selling and most successful medicine of its kind in the world, also
make CHAMBERLAIN'S TABLETS for the Stomach and Liver? Chamberlain’s
Tablets are a new and improved remedy for Biliousness and Disorders of the Stomach, Diver and Bowels ; they have met
with the greatest success in the treatment of Constipation, Biliousness, Sick Headache, Impaired Digestion and Liver
Disorders. Chamberlain’s Tablets not only move the trowels but improve the appetite and correct disorders of the stomach
and liver. Where Chamberlain’s Tablets have been used they are a most popular medicine and everyone who has used them
is pleased with the prompt relief they afford. THEY ARE BETTER THAN PILLS and you would never wish to take another
dose of piils after having used Chamberlain’s Tablets ; they are easier and more pleasant to take, more mild and gentle in
their action and more reliable, as they can always be depended upon. Chamberlain’s Tablets cleanse and invigorate the
stomach and leave the bowels in a natural condition, while pills are more harsh in effect and their use is often followed
by constipation. They are sold bv all chemists and storekeepers throughout the Commonwealth at Is. 6d. per box.

THE woman who tries Bostock shoes for the first
time realises, as soon as her foot slides home,
that here is something different, something
easier arrfl more flexible, than anything she
has yet dreamed of. Then, when she steps out in
them, what an exultant feeling she has of lightness,
buoyancy and freedom. On the top of this, too, there
is that delightful confidence and assurance that come
of being well-dresSed and knowing it. For Bostock
shoes are always designed with one eye on the
fashions of the "day and one eye on the ultimate sat-
isfaction of the wearer.- The result is shoes so well
fitting and so easy, that they feel just like one’s best-
loved old pair, yet so dainty, so original, so
thoroughly well-made that they look and, after quite
a bn- n< p v rr. to look the newest and smart-
est things imaginable.

John Mathew has given up his job as
registrar at the College of Divinity, Mel-
bourne Uni., “owing to the pressure of other
work.” The other work is mostly the editing
of The Presbyterian, the new weekly
organ of Scotchbyterianity in Victoria. The
Assembly lately disagreed with its publishers
as to what was a fair thing in relation to
the profits from the Messenger, then its
official press-vehicle, and decided to pull out
and manage its own newspaper business for
the future. Mathew, who is laps ahead of
most parsons on the literary track, has been
in charge of the Presbyterian flock at Coburg
for over 20 years and is chaplain at Pent-
ridge Stockade.

“Trooper Bluegum”: Welcome another
little stranger. It travels under the curious
title of Barrak, and is the official herald of
the Imperial Camel Corps. It is printed at
Cairo, but edited in the Wadi Ghuzza and
written anywhere from Gaza to the Senussi
country. Strange how Billjim runs to verse!
Half the first issue is in rhyme, and some of
it is quite good enough to get mention in the
“Answers to Correspondents” column of The
Bulletin. Humor and modesty are the
strong points of the publication, and the
editorial announces that “it may be sent to
any part of the civilised world or Australia.”

From his cobber in France: —
The Bulletin's contributor “Brassard” has carried
his last stretcher. It was during the Messines stunt.
He and three others were bringing in a wounded
man, carrying shoulder high, when a Krupp of 5.9
calibre burst practically underneath them. “Bras-
sard” was mortally hit in the stomach; the others
got off with “Blighties.” The patient escaped with-
out further hurt. “Brassard” was the life of the nth
ambulance—editor of its rag, The Fukphy, leader
of its debating club and a hard worker for all its
out-of-the-line efforts. He was only 27 when the
dismiss came. His dinkum name was A. J. Aston.

“Chinh”: The bqsiest pressman in
Bananaland these days is The Bulletin’s
old contributor E. S. Emerson. His latest
side-line is the soldiers’ paper, the National
Leader, which he edits in succession
Brown, who married and went to U.S.A.
A recent Emersonian leader in Brisbane
Courier on the beauty of the bush landed
its author into a pleasant argument with
Arthur Davis. “Steele Rudd,” now a solemn
suburbanite, doesn’t (or says he doesn’t)
hold with the nature-loving ex-Gippslander’s
boosting of the bush as a joy for ever. His

“E.S.D.”: The first woman Inky Way-
farer to do Parliamentary gallery work in
Bananaland, if not in Australia, is Edith
Shirley. For some years she was social
writer for Brisbane Telegraph, but re-
cently she shouldered her pen, went forth
as a freelance, and overlooks the House as
representative of the Ipswich Times. Dr.
John Shirley, head of the Teachers’ Train-
ing College, is her father.

“Copy Boy” : During a London trial Harriet
Jay, author of “When Knights Were Bold”
and a number of other plays, said that when
the comedy was at the height of its London
boom her maximum income from it was £25
a week. Which goes further to show that
playwriting in England, allowing for one or
two exceptional cases, is not the enormously-
profitable game it is supposed to be. Arnold
Bennett, who ought to know, stated some
time back that a successful play is not
nearly so good a money-maker for its author
as a successful novel. Very few playwrights
can make as much as £5OOO out of 500 per-
formances at a West End theatre, and 500
performances mean a great success. A
novelist, working on a 25 per cent, royalty,
would make more out of a book as approxi-
mately successful, and some front-rank
novelists are able to extract per cent.
On these terms it is only necessary for an
author to sell 50,000 copies to net £5OOO,
and it is much more usual for a novelist to
reach a sale of 50,000 than it is for a
dramatist to attain 500 West End perform-
ances. Wells sold 50,000 copies of “Mr.
Britling Sees It Through” in Britain and
130,000 in the U.S.A., not to mention his
sales in this and other parts.
SPRING POETS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Here’s Spring! Oh, don't you feel the rout ?
Oh, can’t you hear their voices—
The youthful and exuberant shout,
The rhyme that fresh and choice is!
’Tis Spring I ’Tis Spring! Hark to the hum
As on the glad wee poets come!
Haste! Haste before the flight may pass,
And see them leaping in the grass!
The morning sun is full of mirth,
The joyous sky expanding
Sheds love upon the happy earth;
A keen new understanding
Is all abroad, and to and fro
The little poets frisking go.
Where waratah displays her gem
The hills are almost black with them.
They trill and twitter in the trees,
And on the rocky ranges
They’re trying o’er their pretty glees
With hope that never changes.
Spring’s in the blood, it’s in the brain!
The bush bards’ wood-and-water strain
Fills all the air. Here to Dundalk
A poet cheeps on every stalk.
Turn out, and see the poets skip!
Come, join them in the frolic!
You’re one if you can rhyme a quip
Or string a verse bucolic.
Fare forth, and see the poets swarm
And gambol in the noontide warm;
For here they “lisp in numbers” great
Such as no man may calculate.
VICTORIA.

The Great Inventor has made
music’s re-creation possible
through the medium of
The NEW EDISON
The wonderful Edison Diamond Stylus Reproducer, the
hard, special material of the record and the marvellously
sensitive diaphragm are but three of the features of The
NEW EDISON which have made Music’s Re-creation an
accomplished fact.
That The NEW EDISON does Re-create music has been
proved to the astonishment and delight of world-famed
musical critics.
The Daily Globe-Democrat, of St. Louis, in reporting an Edison
Tone Test, reads: “The unison between the tones of her (Anna
Case’s) voice and the Re-creation on The NEW EDISON was so
remarkable that trained ears could not detect the slightest
* difference.”
Wherever* Tone Tests have been made, reports like this invari-
ably follow.
This —the finest instrument the world knows —should be in
YOUR home, for it makes a home the world’s greatest stage.

A Perfect Bath Heater
A cold shower is all right but
it—doesn’t cleanse. It closes the
pores instead of cleansing them.
Cleanliness and Health both de-
mand a Warm Bath, and besides
—to take the cold edge off the
morning shower these days is no
little luxury.
The Danks
Bath Heater
With Hot Shower Attachment
is something new, something different—something better than an
ordinary bath-lieater. Tested at the Technical College it was proved
most economical in gas consumption.
It is a highly-superior, SYDNEY-MADE article, made of copper, and
exquisitely finished—artistic, strong, and ever ready to give a quick
supply at minimum cost. All important is the fact that it is a “non-
contact” Heater, which leaves the water pure and free from fumes.
It takes up no floor-space —you can attach it to the wall over the bath.
Call in—see one demonstrated. We have also chip heaters, at various
nrices.

Backache! Why?
Do you rise in the morning with a groan? Do you feel that you are
getting old? Having made up your mind that you are a .martyr, do you
vent your ill-humor on the family? After a while, the pain and stiffness
leave you, and you forget your troubles until the next morning, when
the same dull pain in the small of your back, the difficulty of bracing
your nerves, brings back all the dire forebodings of the day before.
This is the way Kidney Trouble creeps on its victim, and you are
starting on a long journey towards ill-health and infirmity. The
Kidneys are overtaxed with the work of cleansing out the impurities
from your blood. Each day there is an accumulation of waste which
must upset the body. It forms Uric Acid, and Uric Acid is the most
insidious form of poisoning that can take place in your body. The
number of ills to which it leads is almost limitless, and though middle
age is the most favorable season for their activity, even the youngest
child often suffers, and sometimes dies from the different manifestations
of Kidney Trouble.
A change of diet is an advisable precaution, but a reliable, specially-
prepared remedy for Kidney Trouble, such as Dr. Sheldon’s Gin Pills, is
the safeguard for your health. Dr. Sheldon’s Gin Pills stimulate your
sluggish kidneys to reaction, and assist the work of removing impurities
from your blood, which the' kidneys have been unable to accomplish
unassisted. Then their tonic action so revives the kidneys that are
filtering the blood that the work is done automatically as by a perfect
machine. Your back straightens up, the pulling, dragging feeling
gradually leaves you ; in the morning you can leap from bed, feeling a
glow of health and vigor, and meet life with a smiling face. It is the
duty of every man, not only to himself, but to the world at large, to keep
his health in the proper condition for his daily task; and for the victim
of Kidney Trouble Dr. Sheldon’s Gin Pills give just the little boost
his organs need to make them his slave, instead of his being a slave to
ill-health.
Gin Pills Will Help You.
If you suffer with Pains in your Back or Sides, or have any signs
of Kidney Trouble or Rheumatism, such as puffy swellings under the
eyes or in the feet or ankles; if you are Nervous, Tired and Run Down,
or bothered with Urinary Disorders, Dr. Sheldon’s Gin Pills for Backache
and Kidney Trouble are the Remedy which will quickly relieve you of
your misery. You can secure an original bottle of Dr. Sheldon’s Gin
Pills for Backache and Kidney Troubles from all Chemists and Store-
keepers for 1/6; or, in larger bottles, holding more than twice the
quantity, for 2/6; or, if not obtainable locally, will be sent post free on
receipt of price in postal notes or stamps by the
SHELDON DRUG CO. LTD., 15 O’Connell Street, Sydney, N.S.W.

Girl with the Axe.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
GIRL with the axe! You swing to the
sweep of the axe’s descending ;
Yellow of hair you are, and the
green of the trees is aglance,
And the gold of the sun with the gold of
your aureoled temples is blending,
And the light through the leaves mottles
white on your arms that are strong as a
man’s!
Lifting and poised for the blow, then down
to the beat of it bending,
Swift with your palms to the handle, the
soft sudden breath on your lips,
Giving with slackening fingers to the shock
of the stroke at its ending,
Laughing across to my laughter in the scat-
tering leap of the chips!
You are my woman ! Once, in the lonelier
time ere we mated,
Something afar for the seeking, meet to be
coveted, wild ;
Now, through the intimate hours and the
prime of a love unabated,
Tameless, yet tender and proven; mother-
elect of my child !
Straight as a sapling and supple the
strength of you, lissomely-moulded,
Level and candidly-clear are your eyes of
convolvulus-blue,
Splendid the lift of your bosom in the sheath
of the garments enfolded,
Woven of flame and of laughter the crystal-
line spirit of you !
Strangely from fire and from flowers and
sap of the woods are you fashioned,
Mingled with snow, and the stillness of
forest-pools under the moon,
Subtle and finely immortal, yet mortally
textured and passioned,
Petals for lips, and for tresses the silk of a
golden cocoon.
What but the riot of springtime, the veriest
vintage of living,
Leaps from your heart to the tips of the
fingers that rest on the haft?
What but the joy of possessing, the joy of
the ultimate giving,
Rang in the rhyme that you chanted,
thrilled in your voice when you laughed?
Maid of a maidhood surrendered, a mother-
hood yet in the making,
Type of our women from older and sullener
lands gathered forth,
Once, to the sun and the southward, grey
seas and grey granite forsaking,
Here, to the goal of their questing, your
fathers fared out of the North!
This do I know by your whiteness, your
loose-banded hair that is yellow—
Further I care not or question, seeing your
womanhood true,
Fitting your love to my loving, as the hand
of a man to its fellow,
You are my mate and my woman; none
other is there but you!
Masterless, mastering, facile ; wondrous, im-
palpable, human,
Casting a chain with your kisses, weaving a
spell with your eyes,
Strong, and of infinite weakness; change-
lessly, changeably woman ;
Knowing not patience or wisdom; wise as
the Sibyl was wise!
God, who is hid in the gullies, thought of
you, planned you and made you,
Captured and closed in your body your soul
from the Infinite blown,
Then, where our crossways commingled,
watched for my coming and stayed you.
So that we travelled thereafter the road I
had trodden alone.
There is a path from the hillside, a cabin in
brush,- in the hollow,
Fuel and drink and a larder, a hearthway of
smoke-blackened stone, *
A red-hearted log in the even, barred doors
where no footstep may follow.
Brave curtains that meet on the sashes, one
corner two lovers have known ;
So low is the roof, and so hidden the track
with its tortuous winding,
That never the step of a stranger goes by on
the gravel or grass;
To the threshold no hap may discover, to
the door that is safe from the finding,
No feet but the feet of the woman, the feet
of her lover, may pass.
Girl with the axe, you have paused ; and the
scarlet and white of your laughter
Beckon me close, and your glamor lies
warm on my senses like wine.
What of the days that have been, or the
nights that shall wrap us hereafter?
The sun dazzles down through the treetops;
the West flickers out; you are mine.
Who shall seek out or interpret, who shall
divine or discover
The way of the wind through the forest, the
way of the bird in the dew,
The path of the tides to the shingles, or a
maid’s to the heart of her lover?
You are my mate and my woman no other
woman but you !
VICTORIA.
BERNARD S. BALLIOT.
Beelzebub’s Private Yacht.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THE presence of a German submarine
(1917 model) upon Beelzebub’s pri-
vate lake in Hell certainly needs
some explanation. Of course, bis Satanic
Majesty has every right to possess a
private yacht on the lovely lake of
liquid fire that ornaments the extensive
grounds of his country residence in
Ilell; he owns the estate, and is rich
enough to gratify his most expensive whim.
And this was really quite a harmless fancy.
The suggestion came from one of the many
American millionaires who had the entree
to Beelzebub’s official receptions in his
palace at the capital; but without the co-
operation of quite another social class his
Satanic Majesty would not have been able
to gratify his ambition.
“It’s a charming idea, old chap,” he cour-
teously remarked to the most-damned of the
millionaires, during a quiet little supper at
the palace; “but where could I get a fire-
proof private yacht? My gardener tells me
that no vessel yet built could live in a lake
of liquid fire. He even suggested an in-
genious method of cooling the lake. But a
lowering of the temperature would be no
use to me: I’m so subject to lumbago.”
The most-damned millionaire regretfully
admitted that the proposition was a difficult
one.
“Bli’me,” exclaimed a gentleman sitting
at the far end of the supper-table, “me and
me old mates could get your Majesty a ship
that could sail any ocean ever boiled.”
The speaker was an old gentleman wear-
ing on his wrists a pair of iron bracelets
quaintly joined by a heavy iron chain ; and
when he clumsily rose to speak the clanking
of iron at his feet indicated that he wore
anklets to match —an idiosyncrasy of fashion
that several of his fellow-guests affected.
“There’s an old ship me and me mates
knows well,” he said. “She’s lying idle in
Sydney Harbor, down in Australia —you re-
member Australia, your Majesty?”
His Majesty distinctly recalled the place.
In fact, he felt sure that Australia was
known better in Hell than in.... well,
another place.
“Well, this old ship may be a bit slow in
answerin’ her helm ; but if your Maj. will
provide me with a,crew of genu-ine old Syd-
ney convicts —men I can trust —I’d guaran-
tee to navigate her to Hell.”
“Brimstone and asbestos!” cried his host,
using his favorite oath, “an old sailing clip-
per is no use to me! She’d burn like paper.”
“Not that old clipper, your Maj.,” re-
marked the old gentleman with the iron
jewellery. “She’s built of stone.”
And he explained to the interested supper-
party that the ship he had his eyes on was
an island in Sydney Harbor. It was a small
island strongly fortified, that looked curi-
ously like a ship at anchor. It was used, in
the days when Botany Bay got its convicts
from England, instead of manufacturing
them itself, to confine the more desperate
deportees. But now it was transformed into
a fort, and was inhabited only by a care-
taker and his family.
“I know every inch of the place,” said
the old sailor, “and from what I hears
the old craft hasn’t changed much. Her
lines are not exactly built for speed (she’s
rather too broad in the beam), but from
what my friend the Bishop tells me, there’s
cosy captain’s quarters, and a bit of a
kitchemgarden where they hangs their
clothes out ter dry on washin’-days. And
she’s stout and serviceable every inch of
’er; and with a crew of picked salts,
chaps that were sent out like me, for the
mutiny at the Nore, we’d navigate the old
tub to Blazes.”
“Stone,” mused Beelzebub. “Made of
stone ! The very thing for my lake of fire.
And heavy enough to ride edsily on the
molten waves. Well, sir, pick your crew!”
So Convict No. 9847 hurried to the Aus-
tralian torture-chamber with an order for
the release of twenty old-time convicts, the
oldest and nibst respected inhabitants of
that department. And Beelzebub himself
attended the official farewell luncheon. He
gave them his official curse and three
months, reckoning in earth-time, to return
with their prize.
Luckily it was a wild night when the
little band of convicts approached Sydney
Heads. The same favorable weather accom-
panied them on their trip up the harbor.
They pulled doggedly, until a flash of light-
ning showed them Pinchgut close on their
port beam.
Their captain swung the helm round, and
urged on his willing crew. Though a red
light was burning on the flagstaff there was
no sign of a look-out. Pinchgut lay silent,
like an abandoned derelict. Carefully creep-
ing up on the lee side the boat lay-to, while
the captain sought for an open port in the
grim bulk of the island’s stone sides. But
all was darkness. A wild hope in the cap-
tain’s mind that the caretaker might be one
of those people who read in bed and leave
their bedroom window open had to be re-
gretfully dismissed.
“Prepare to board!” he hissed. Then, at
the whisper, “Boarders away!” the picked
party swarmed up the wall, and leapt
silently into the kitchen-garden at the stern.
The midshipman unfortunately landed in a
glass-covered forcing box; but luckily there
was not a soul on deck, though such care-
lessness shocked the souls of these ancient
tars. Eirst saluting the quarter-deck, these
pigtailed scoundrels stealthily made their
way to the captain’s quarters. Their leader,
tiptoeing through the open cabin door, found
the captain and his wife sound asleep, and
in the next cabin discovered his four chil-
dren, also deep in slumber. Convict 9847
raised his cutlass to despatch the enemy, but
a happy thought struck him. Why not take
the whole crew as prisoners back to Hell?
So he merely locked the bedroom doors and
pocketed the keys.
The next step was to weigh ahchor. The
pirates wasted a valuable half-hour before
they discovered that Pinchgut had no anchor
to weigh ; the old craft was merely stranded
on the rocks. However, these old salts, who
had once been on the point of capturing the
whole British fleet, were undismayed. If
their prize was stranded they must heave
her off. Accordingly they leapt ovei'board,
and humming a most blasphemous chantey,
succeeded in setting the unwieldy craft
afloat. Meanwhile the boatswain had been
rummaging in the hold, and had brought out
an ancient set of sails. These the crew
triumphantly hoisted on the only mast, and,
running aloft the pirate flag that had been
officially cursed by Beelzebub at their fare-
well luncheon, they took up their stations.
No one saw the old fortress slowly gather
way and waddle down the Harbor. The
night was too thick ; and all the ferryboats
had long ago gone home to bed. Her pro-
gress was slow and erratic; but the captain
on the bridge smiled satisfaction with his
command. He manoeuvred her brilliantly
through the Heads; and a heavy rain-squall
accompanied her until she had passed the
area swept by the searchlights. Con-

Boils, Pimples, Spots, Rashes § other
Spring Skin-Troubles Banished,
WITH the approach of Spring do you find little
rough patches on your forehead, or cheek, or
chin? Has your skin a curious “tight” feeling? Are
your hands or finger-ends sore? Is your skin disfigured
by nasty pimples, boils, abscesses or eruptions? Have
you a raw, tender feeling where your skin creases—or
are you very liable to chafing about the neck?
These “danger signals,” which constitute the first
signs of an unhealthy skin, should never be neglected.
Following in their train are all the tortures of fiery
eczema, wide-reaching blood poison, and ulcerous sores.
Nothing is more important than the way we should
treat this skin disease. It is not the slightest use rely,
ing upon any internal remedy or external application if
these do not reach the impurity itself, which is the
cause of the disorganisation in our delicate and intricate
tissues. Cheap and coarse ointments and so-called
blood-mixtures may make eczema “slumber” awhile,
but the disease soon breaks forth in all its “fire” and
itching irritation, for the root-evil has not been touched.
Zam-Buk is the ideal Spring Skin-Balm. Zam-Buk
is so refined that the tissues absorb it readily; and its
medicinal essences at once attack the disease below the
surface. Wherever the skin has been injured by acci-
dent or eaten by disease, Zam-Buk promotes the growth
of new and healthy tissues in a quick and natural
| manner.
Zam-Buk, the Invalu-
able Spring Skin-Balm,
is excellent for Boils,
Pimples, Eruptions,
Eczema, Abscesses and
Blemishes; & promptly
heals Cuts, Burns,
Sores, Bruises, Abra-
sions, Scalds, Scalp
Troubles, Wounds,
Piles, Sprains, etc.
Obtainable from all
Chemists and Stores at
1/6 per pot, or 3/6
family size (containing
nearly four times the
1/6).
I EVERY HOME NEEDS ZAM-BUK|
Mr. H. Christie, of 16 London Street, Enmore, Sydney,
says: — “l was troubled with boils, and tried all manner of
things to get rid of them, but to no avail. Seeing Zam-Buk
advertised, I procured a pot, and applied it as directed, with
the pleasing result that the boils had entirely disappeared after
three days' treatment.”

NO SHAVE
vict 9847 heaved a sigh of relief; Beelzebub
was affording the adventure all the protec-
tion in his power.
But once out into the Pacific troubles
began. However suitable a stone craft
might be for an ornamental lake of liquid
fire, such a vessel possesses obvious disad-
vantages for navigating the Pacific Ocean
in a storm. Heavy seas swept over her,
carrying away the clothes-props and wash-
ing away a bed of lettuces and three rows
of early peas. The boatswain reported a
leak between two blocks of sandstone; and
on sounding the spare bedroom the ship's
carpenter reported two feet of water on
the linoleum. Disaster threatened: the
Pinchgut was slowly settling down. Many
of the crew feared that they would never
see Hell again. Soon the waves were rising
over the starboard kitchen-garden ; and with
a heartrending crash the stern chimney went
by the board.
The captain swore an ancient oath —
dating from the time when sailors’ oaths
were envied in Hell—that he would never
desert his prize. It was now only a question
of time before she sank. True, he could
have navigated the ship back to Sydney Har-
bor : but Convict 9847 was made of sterner
stuff. He would rather go down with all
his crew than acknowledge defeat by a
cowardly return to safety. He set all hands
to bail: but as all that the crew could find
for that purpose were teacups and table-
spoons, the water continued to gain. Then
he rigged up a pump made from the garden-
hose and attached it to a sewing-machine
discovered in the children’s nursery, and
himself took a hand at the machine. After
ten minutes’ pumping he was delighted to
find that, though the Pinchgut was riding
dangerously low on the water, the sewing-
machine pump had got the upper hand of
the leak.
At that desperate moment a flash of light-
ning showed the brave captain a remark-
able sight. Straight ahead a curious craft
was lying awash. The old seaman was
puzzled for a moment; but another conveni-
ent flash showed him that he had almost
rammed a modern submarine. (He had seen
a picture of one in the reading-room of the
Ancient Mariners’ Club —one of the oldest
and least respectable institutions of Hades.)
And from her periscope fluttered a German
flag.
Now, Convict 9847 hated Germans: it
was his good old British habit to hate any
other flag that dared to desecrate any of
his oceans. Particularly, however, he hated
wdiat he termed Dutchies —a mere land-
people who spoke an outlandish lingo of
their own. Besides, even a convict and a
mutineer was a Britisher, and therefore
equal to three, or three-and-a-half, foreigners.
In the smoking-room of the Ancient Marin-
ers’ Club he and his cronies had often argued
this question; but they could never agree
about the odd half. Here was a Hell-given
chance to settle that century-old dispute.
He gave a crisp order, and the black pirate
flag fluttered dow r n from the clothes-prop
they had rigged as a jury-mast, and the
Union Jack flew up and broke out to the
breeze.
The German submarine was stationary,
swept by the heavy seas. She w T as under-
going repairs, having mislaid a sparking-
plug. The German commander, hastily
summoned from his sleep in the starboard
torpedo-tube, hurried up on deck in his
pyjamas and pink bedroom slippers. He
stared at the strange craft with a sinking
feeling at the pit of his stomach, which he
bravely put down to an overdose of com-
pressed synthetic sausage at supper.
“So,” he muttered, “dose Englander pig-
dogs haf a new trick found der kindly Ger-
man sailor-man to murder! Der freedom of
der seas! Mein Gott, vot chanst haf a Ger-
man der seas to sail in freedom now got, ven
dey against us houses bring? But dey de-
ceive us not; dose walls of stone, dey are
not of stone built; dey but painted fright-
fulness are. So! I shall against dat ter-
race of semi-detached cottages a dorpedo out
send —and ve see shall!”
He shouted an order in that broken Eng-
lish that all Germans speak, according to
the cartoonists of the Allies. As he care-
fully saved all his verbs for the end of his
sentence, it took a few minutes before the
torpedo-lieutenant sorted out the grammar
and got the hang of the order. Those min-
utes wasted by the German language—the
real reason why Germany can never conquer
the world—were precious to the captain of
the Pinchgut. In that brief interval he had
acted. He loaded the old muzzle-loader that
used to be fired at 1 p.m. every day to give
the time to the ships in Sydney Harbor, and
crowded on every inch of canvas.
The German captain, in his excitement,
got so tangled up with German verbs that
he merely gabbled, and his order the torpedo
in all haste to off fire, came one second too
late. The next thing he knew was that the
stone island was butting almost on top of
him. and that a villainous body of rascals
armed with pikes—they w T ere really broom-
sticks —was swarming aboard. The fight was
short and sharp. The German commander
was tossed overboard in the midst of a
contorted protest against the lack of culture
of these English pirates; and he came up
three times in order to get rid of three
verbs that were worrying him, then dis-
appeared in a foam of adjectives and past-
particles for ever. The rest of the crew
suffered the same fate, though, not being so
full of German vocabulary and inflexions,
their death was mercifully swifter.
“That’s the way, me hearties!” the victori-
ous No. 9547 shouted. “Reminds me of our
methods at the mutiny of the Nore. And
now what shall we do with this awkward-
looking contraption?”
It was the boatswain who made the sug-
gestion. “Seems ter me, Cap’n.” he replied,
chewing a German cigar, “this ’ere craft
sails better’n the old Pinchgut—any’ow, she
couldn’t roll wuss. We’d better aban-
don the old lugger and get along ’oine in
this.”
“Dog!” the captain roared. “Go back
without his Majesty’s private yacht, war-
ranted to sail the hottest sea in Hell?”
“She’ll sail the wettest sea on earth all
right,” the hardy boatswain replied—“to
the bottom! Unless we about-ship the old
Pinchgut and make full speed fer Sydney
’Arbor, neither Sydney nor Hell will ever
see ’er again. And, pardon me, Cap’n, there
are seven innereent British souls sleeping
peacefully on board the ole Pinchgut, count-
in’ the cat-; and you would not let ’em
drown.”
Convict 9847 was touched. The tears
streamed down his scarred but manly face at
this aspersion upon his race. He stamped
his foot —and suddenly bent down, interested.
“Steel! All steelhe cried. “This craft
i 3 made of steel. Not a bit of woodwork
about her, me ’earties! Bli’me, we’ve found
his Majesty’s Private Yacht. She’s just
made for sailing seas of fire. I shall trans-
fer my flag and sail her as a prize all the
way to Hell!”
“Hell! Hell! Hurrah!” The crew gave a
cheer.
Convict 9847 put a prize crew aboard the
old Pinchgut, and waited about, wallowing
in the Pacific and repairing the sparking
plug, until the crew returned in their old
whaleboat. They reported that they made
their way into the harbor unseen and had
securely beached the old fortress more or
less where she had been stranded, without
waking anybody but the cat. And then the
submarine, rechristened Pinchgut the Sec-
ond, set forth on her long journey to Hell,
home and brimstone.
Next morning there were strange rumors
afloat in Sydney Harbor. The searchlight
men thought they had glimpsed two strange
craft near the Heads. The caretaker of
Pinchgut reported that in the night he had
awakened with the profound conviction that
there was a burglar beneath his bed; he
had promptly awakened his wife and asked
her to investigate, but she had told him not
to be an old fool. The Admiralty sent out
warnings about an alleged German sub-
marine seen in the Pacific. But nobody paid
the least attention to the curious story told
by the caretaker's youngest son, a bright
youth of six. It was a mixed-up story, full
of ancient mariners with ancient oaths, some
of wdiich the boy remembered and proudly
repeated, of his bedroom going up and down
like a rocking-horse, and of the curious con-
versation he had heard, peering from his
bedroom window, between Pinchgut and a
German submarine. His mother promptly
smacked him for telling lies, assured him in
the presence of her husband that he didn’t
get that habit from her side of the family,
and gave him a large dose of castor-oil. But
he stuck to his belief, and, duly encouraged
thereto by the promise of ample supplies of
chewing-gum, retailed to me his preposterous
yarn.
I did not believe it till some weeks later,
when a liner ran ashore on Pinchgut, and
at the marine inquiry the strange fact came
out that the British Admiralty charts of
Sydney Harbor placed old Pinchgut IS feet
further to the east than it actually was.
. Still, you can’t expect a gang of con-
victs escaped from Hell to be so painfully
meticulous as the British Admiralty.

Garden Street.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Long and drowsy and white and wide,
Villas and arbors on either side,
Over it sparkling the cloudless skies,
Garden Street in the sunlight lies.
Twice a day—at the morning hour,
And again when the lights of sunset
flower—■
Its pavements ring to the footfall-noise
Of men and women, and girls and boys.
Townward, sprightly of foot, they go ;
Home they come in the evening glow,
Labors over and questing done—
Some with money and some with none.
Most hours through, from morn to night.
It dreams and dreams in the drowsy light:
No call is there of the huckster-clan.
Of the bottle-o and the rabbit-man.
Scents of roses and nameless flowers
Perfume the march of the golden hours;
Under the laurels, cooling the eye,
Pools of shade in the sunshine lie.
All day long, and night-long too,
Sunlight sweetened or washed by dew,
Leaf and petal and fern and palm
Open their lungs outbreathing balm.
Now the cooing of doves is heard.
Now the song of a single bird ;
Beetles drone, and the murmuring bees
Make their round of the flowers and trees.
Echoes alone of the trouble and strife,
Stir and clamor and noise of life—
Hints alone of its hurry and heat
Steal through the quiet of Garden Street
Traffic and Trade, with eyes awry,
Seek the city and pass it by ;
Few daylong through its distance wend
V ith money to make or money to spend.
Yet yesterday, when the moon was sped.
Up and down, with a furtive tread.
Lounged a rogue with a wistful smile.
Whistling a jig on the wind the while.
Twice or thrice in the stirless trance
Stilling his feet, he paused to glance
Over the way to the Doric gate
Where the laurels droop and the poppies
wait.
Hogue and robber and fool, I swear—
Love was the plunder that brought him
there;
Love that laughed through a curtain of
green,
Watching his tricks the while. I ween.
Rogue and robber, he went awav
Sour and sick at the end of day/
Empty of hope and sad to see;
For bolt and bar on her heart had she.
She who lives in the Doric house,
Secret and shy as a little mouse,
Dainty and dear from head to feet —
Pinksie. Princess of Garden Street!

A Natural Remedy
Time was when disease was thought to be due to the
direct influence of evil spirits, and exorcism and magic
were invoked to cast it out.
Science has taught us wisdom. The evil spirits exist
still. We call them ‘‘Disease Germs,” and tiny also
must be cast out. Once lodged in the stomach or
intestines, fever with its hallucinations, of biliousness with
its aches and pains, is the result.
ENO S FRUIT SALT’
is the approved remedy for driving out disease germs.
Its action is quick and thorough. It clears the intestines,
rouses the torpid liver to new life, stimulates the mucous
membrane to a healthy action, and cleanses and invigorates
the whole digestive tract.
Be prepared for emergencies by always keeping a
bottle in the house.

SOMETHING
If Engineers and Steam-plant Owners would only
realise the importance of EFFICIENTLY insulating
their Boilers, Steam Pipes, etc., more attention might
be paid to this particular matter. Great economies
can be effected in this direction, in some cases the coal
consumption being reduced as much as 50%. But the
insulating material must be of the very best.
Carbonate of Magnesia is to-day recognised as the best
non-conductor of heat. Newall's Coverings are com-
posed of 85% of this material, and 15% Asbestos—the
Asbestos being used for binding purposes only—and in
addition possess innumerable advantages over all other
forms of lagging. Newall’s Coverings are used, practi-
cally exclusively, by the British Admiralty, N.S.W.
and Victorian Governments, and have been used
throughout the Ultimo. White Bay, Melbourne, Pertb
and Canberra Power Stations.
