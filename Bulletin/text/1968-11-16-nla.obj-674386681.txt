Apologies to any subscribers who
received their copy of The Bulletin late
last week. The delay was due to the
Sydney postal strike.
One more week
FLIGHT DELAYED
THE RAAF should prepare for a pro-
longed wait before taking delivery of
its first F-III bomber. To a well-placed
desk in Canberra last week came word
of a new delay while the General
Dynamics Corporation strengthens the
pivoting area around the wings of all
F-IIIs, a lengthy job.
WHERE THE ACTION IS
“WELL, WE MADE IT,” said Mr.
Con Boeve with a grin for all comers.
As the international director of the
Michigan furniture firm of Herman
Miller Inc., he had just arrived at Mel-
bourne’s Southern Cross Hotel after an
all-night Pacific flight. As he divested
himself of his overcoat he extracted his
flight-reading, a book about the world-
wide impact of American technology
and selling technique. “Marvellous
book, but frightening,” he said.
Well tanned, a youngish 35 with
silvering side levers, Mr. Boeve had
come to Australia to keep the Austral-
American consortium of Herman Miller
Inc. up-to-date on the latest develop-
ments in American office design.
Although Herman Miller had not in-
vented the idea of “office landscaping,”
Mr. Boeve explained that his was the
first company to produce the “hard-
ware” which could make the idea
feasible.
“Our idea — called ‘office action’ —
is really a series of furniture pieces or
hardware pieces which enable you to
work in many varied positions and to
maintain a variety of work situations.
We think in terms of a work arena,
and our hardware is designed for a
human environment. It is round-
cornered, smooth, and pro-man, there
are no anti-man forms. We feel, at
Herman Miller, that the office equip-
ment of today as we know it has
developed a lot of failures ... failures
in terms of human failures.” For
example, Herman Miller roll-top desks
overcame the clean-desk syndrome,
which always interrupted one’s work
situation at the end of the day.
Mr. Boeve explained that his com-
pany was opposed to the dog-box
cubicles and rows of regimented desks
which had been the plan of most office
floors for a century. “Office action”
instead thought of workers as “task
forces” to be related and integrated by
the tasks they performed.
Also, to produce maximum efficiency
and maximum comfort for the office
worker Mr. Boeve’s company had
designed “multi-work stations” which
would enable a person to do different
tasks, standing, sitting, leaning, or
lounging.
This variety of . work position
prompted health and vitality as well as
serving the practical purpose of making
it easier for standing executives to get
rid of people quickly. They didn’t have
to invite others to sit down. “In fact,”
said Mr. Boeve, “one guy at our head
office now likes standing so much he
never sits down.”
BACK TO THE FILES
ALL THE things that Mr. Richard M.
Nixon has had to say on his long haul
to the White House suddenly are being
re-inspected. What was once filtered by
the world as campaign strategy is now
being given careful examination as
probable policy. Canberra’s America-
watchers weren’t slow to go back to the
files for clues to Mr. Nixon’s foreign
policy. Since the day that his election
was confirmed, The Bulletin’s Canberra
office has had a steady stream of visitors
asking for back copies of our October
14, 1967, issue, which carried a long
article by Mr. Nixon entitled “Asia
After Vietnam.” In view of the fact
that at that time Mr. Nixon was still
a long way from Republican Party
endorsement, we can modestly claim a
marginally prescient view of last week’s
poll. We headed the article: “Written
by the man who could become the next
President of the United States.”
NORTHERN TEMPTATIONS
“THE HARD SELL,” we’d always
understood, isn’t the sort of thing one
comes across much in North Queens-
land. But in the past few weeks, every-
body from air-conditioning company
executives in Melbourne to heads of
Government departments in Canberra
have been subjected to glowing recitals
about northern potential. For the
People the North Committee, as part
of its new “diplomatic approach,” is
abroad in the South — spreading the
message of opportunity for all.
It wants, among other things, more
MOVING, SELLING
THOMAS KENEALLY has left his
hot typewriter to cool for three weeks
while he visits the Antarctic. He has
gone there, as the guest of the United
States Government, primarily to com-
plete research for his latest novel,
which is centred on a character with
Antarctic obsessions and to which he
has given the working title “On Ice.”
When he returns to Sydney at the
end of the month he will go almost
immediately to Armidale to take up a
post in the extension department of
the University of New England,
where, he says, he has been guaran-
teed plenty of time to continue
writing. But it is not only time he is
after. “To make a decent living as a
writer I’d have to produce a book
a year. I am really bourgeois when
it comes to such considerations; I can-
not help thinking of a future when
there might be no book and no
money. The job at Armidale—it was
offered to me, I didn’t seek it—seems
to me to be a pretty satisfactory
solution.”
Meanwhile, sales of Keneally’s most
recent book, “Three Cheers for the
Paraclete,” are banking him a decent
living for at least one year as well as
demonstrating his growing stature in
Australian literature. With almost
12,000 copies already sold, Angus and
Robertson are about to put “Paraclete”
into a third printing of at least 4000.
The U.S. rights have been sold, nego-
tiation of the paperback rights is close
to conclusion, and several countries are
after the translation rights. He is on
the last draft of his Antarctic novel—
“My trip down there will fill in the
blanks in my research”—and he has
begun a commissioned play for the
1970 Adelaide Arts Festival. The play
is about a post-nuclear holocaust society
and involves eight characters living at
the top of four neighboring sky-
scrapers.
Being the year’s most irresistibly suc-
cessful man of the arts in Australia,
has not, though, been without hazards.
“It is becoming difficult to discipline
the tremendous attempts to draw me
into secondary causes,” he says. The
comparative tranquillity of Armidale
might help him to stay on a primary
course.

tourist accommodation on the islands
of the Great Barrier Reef, increased
shipping services, and more companies
to open branch plants in North Queens-
land.
Councillor Dudley Wood, the chair-
man of the Committee, and its pro-
motions officer, Mr. Maurice Stitt, were
in Sydney last week on a tour which
also was to take in Melbourne, Can-
berra, Launceston, and Hobart before
they go back to Queensland to meet an
American investors’ tour. If there is
not sufficient response from local
investors, then, they say, they’ll be
forced to woo their foreign counterparts.
But, so far, things look vaguely
encouraging. Some firms have promised
“immediate investigation” into their
suggestions, and in Canberra people
were “helpful.” Certainly, the Com-
mittee is being comprehensive in its
campaign, lobbying for everything—
from a naval base in North Queensland
to irrigation for rice, maize, and sorg-
hum growing.
Beef cattle and sugar have always
been North Queensland’s main indus-
tries, “and they’ll remain so, but we
want to put eggs into other baskets as
well,” says Mr. Stitt. One probability
is tourism, which Councillor Wood is
backing as “Australia’s number-one
export earner” in the future. However,
with commendable restraint, the Com-
mittee doesn’t visualise North Queens-
land’s coast as an extension of the Gold
Coast. “Not so much the fleshpots, more
the scenic attractions,” is Mr. Stitt’s
view. “Somewhere for the more relaxed
holiday. So we’d like to see cheaper-
type accommodation for the family
man, and we want Government finance
for special tourist roads.”
The Committee, which is part of
the North Queensland Local Govern-
ment Association, is six years old and
moderately happy with the progress of
its principal aim—peopling the north,
but the area’s population is still less
than 4 percent of the total for the
whole of Australia. And one North
Queensland MP, the Federal Member
for Kennedy, has an electorate nearly
the size of N.S.W.
TOPS IN TUCKER
FOR A TEAM coming from Tomato
Sauceland, Australia’s entrants in the
Frankfurt Culinary Olympics didn’t do
badly. Having whipped up such tanta-
lisers as Lamb Chop Jumbuck and
Fillet Steak Merimbula for the judges
they returned with nine gold medals and
the grand gold medal awarded by the
organisers of the event, the Verband
Deutcher Koecher (the Guild of Ger-
man Chefs).
When the team manager, Leslie
Smith, of the Victorian Dennis Hotels,
went to Frankfurt four years ago as an
observer, he returned thinking Austra-
lia would be lucky to win one medal.
After eight months’ training, our five-
man team of Melbourne chefs also won
the Ehren prize for teamwork and the
American Culinary Federation award

THE COMPETING
ATTRACTIONS OF HORSEFLESH
AND SHEILAFLESH
YOU MUST APPRECIATE that Mel-
bourne is trying terribly hard to get
world-wide publicity out of the Mel-
bourne Cup. Therefore, we do not
appreciate it when the Americans hold
a Presidential election on the same day.
Even the Governor-General, Lord Casey,
pointed out that it was rather unfair.
The VRC holds the Melbourne Cup on
the first Tuesday in November. The
U.S. Congress holds its Presidential
election on the first Tuesday after the
first Monday in November. There is a
subtle difference here, but the result is
that they are nearly always on the same
day. You might say the Americans have
been doing this for a very long time,
but so have we. I think the best way
to give priority would be to decide
which nation takes their day most seri-
ously. Well, then, does the United
States give a public holiday for its
Presidential election? Certainly not. We
do.
In recent years, the VRC has tried
to pump life into the Melbourne Cup
with vast heart transplants of sex. Some
of the old racing purists are horrified.
As one owner said on Tuesday: “Why
don’t they drop the horses, put the
sheilas on the track and be done with
it.” But it is interesting to debate
whether or not the sheilas have been
a success. The Caulfield Cup was down
10,000 this year, the Moonee Valley
Cup drew its worst crowd since the
war, and racing in all States is down.
Yet the Melbourne Cup continues to
draw. Once again this year there was
a splendid crowd of 81,000. The only
difficulty is that it’s becoming jolly
difficult to keep up the sheila quality.
One year we had Jean Shrimpton,
another year Baroness Fiona Thyssen,
last year we might have had Princess
Soraya. This year VRC scouts combed
the world for a particularly strong
field of sheilaflesh.
There were 30 girls, Miss World, Miss
Teen International, Miss Tokyo, Miss
Argentina, Miss Ghana, Miss Australia,
a whole team of beauties from New
Zealand, two tea girls from U.S.A., and
a tall, slim New York model, Miss Halle
Gold.
Miss Gold as soon as she arrived in
Queen St. became terribly excited,
“Look . . . look ... a streetcar, I
never saw one before.” Thereupon she
insisted on having a ride down St. Kilda
Road on one of our electric trams. We

The 20 year old pipe-dream
A pipe-dream to many. Not to Ampol. As long ago as 1948
Ampol was convinced there was oil to be
discovered in Australia. Twenty years of believing.
Of undaunted enthusiasm. Lack of funds.
Enormous setbacks. And now oil flows from Barrow Island,
Western Australia. Along 240 miles of flow lines
from producing well and 14 miles of gathering lines.
At the rate of more than 30,000 barrels a day.
No longer a pipe-dream. Ampol now produces, transports,
refines and markets its own products to one high,
consistent standard - the best.
It's good to know the best is Australian.
So why go past the Australian company ?

loved her at once. That sort of thing
goes down awfully well in Melbourne.
We had all these girls parading in
front of the Members’ Stand at Flem-
ington. All the non-privileged non-
members people crowded against the
rail around the members’ area staring
in. Most of them had their backs to
the racetrack. The sheilaflesh was much
more interesting than the horseflesh.
They didn’t even turn round for the
Cup Hurdle, and photographers kept
right on photographing Miss World and
Miss Ghana during the running of the
race. There are two other features that
draw the crowds. There’s the Fashions
on the Field contest. If your outfit wins
a gong with the judges you might win
a trip to Hong Kong, Hawaii, a Volks-
wagen, or even a trip for two to Tiki
Village, Surfers Paradise. Then there
are the society girls who like to get
into the newspapers. The point here'is
“I should’ve known Rain Lover would
win my corn’s playing up!”
to know where to go and when. Every
Cup Day all the social writers, each
with their photographer, stand on the
top steps at the birdcage end of the
Members’ Stand.
These Press women like to get their
pictures early. The evening papers must
have them away by 11 a.,m. or not much
later, and the morning-paper girls like
to go to lunch. So, you see the nice girls
parading from 10.30 a.m. Languidly,
over-nonchalantly, they move up the
steps. “Oh please, please, can’t you see
me?”
This year there were yards and yards
of slacksuits, long black stockings that
would have frightened the hell out of
“The Shrimp” three years ago. But,
honestly, there was very little that was
spectacular, little that one would want
to remember. Except one. This girl was

correspondent ever saw. It is perfectly
true to say that you could see her
cleavage on the wrong side.
The members’ car park was as inter-
esting as ever. This is one of the great
traditions during the Cup carnival,
special positions are allotted, and you
make your own little picnic getting out
there about 10 a.m. It is the greatest
proof that this town is really stinking
rich. There must have been, without
counting the Bentleys, at least 60 Rolls-
Royces there on Tuesday. New Silver
Shadows were common. Actually, there
were three together in one spot.
In the car park some people serve
morning tea and lunch in the grand
manner, with tables, stiff, white table-
cloths, silver, the best glass, with red-
jacketed waiters to serve the iced
champagne and chicken. This year the
caterers provided a special service. You
could buy your champagne, served in
a bucket of ice, right there in the car
park. Personally, I thought this was a
lowering of standards. You should
really bring your own champagne and
own ice buckets.
The Hon. Jon Gilbey, Miss World,
and the Dupont people had a large
marquee, with waiters in black tie. At
the set next door they had bridge
tables, white linen, beach umbrellas,
and they were drinking Veuve Cliquot.
The car park is so comfortable that
the horseracing tends to become a
tiresome interruption. It would be safe
to estimate that about 30 percent of
the customers never leave that car park.
Until now there has been one dis-
advantage in this. One has to walk
over to the racetrack to place one’s
bets. Ah, but this year there was a
splendid improvement, an SP was
running a book.
There is still a curious formality
about the Cup carnival. Some say that
the wearing of formal gear is falling
off, but that is not so. Actually it is
more correct to wear formal gear at
the Derby than at the Cup, but even
so, at the Cup they were all over the
place with no end of grey toppers
and a sprinkling of bowlers. The
courage and vacuity of the Melburnian
male is quite remarkable. The tempera-
ture was nearly 80, yet most of them
turned out in the full bit, topper, hard
collar, check tie, black tails, mustard
or grey double-breasted woollen waist-
coat, striped pants, and some characters
even went for spats. Sir Henry Bolte,
for example, in morning suit and topper,
is a sight to store in your memory
album.
Then the suits that come out are
the same every year you get to
recognise them like old friends. Many
of them, if they could talk, would
remember the victories of Peter Pan,
Spearfelt or even Artilleryman. The
bottoms of their trousers are wide
enough to look like the Dame Pattie
in full sail.
Your correspondent was disappointed
in the Cup. Prominence, a Victorian
horse, was the choice. The last time

MEN LOOKING
A LOT BETTER
THAN WOMEN
THE ARRIVAL of Australia’s first
fashion magazine for men will, no doubt,
be met with cries of delight by gentle-
men outfitters and/or those of the
species who are already what is known
as sharp dressers. For them, whether
“Man About Town” turns out to be
any good or not, the whole business
of dressing fashionably has suddenly
been given, as it were, official status.
What is remarkable is that such a
publication should appear in a country
where most men, if they talk of fashion
at all, say it makes them sick. It sug-
gests that, to the contrary, beneath every
contemptuously rugged exterior there
lies a quivering, radiating Hardy Amies
straining for release.
This could be true. The man who
says “look at women and fashion,” mean-
ing the silly bitches will be conned into
anything, and then in the next breath
claims the only good socks you can
buy come from Harrods is as much a
fussy victim of the rag-trade pressure
as anyone. And, although in Britain
a man’s black tie will be his pride, and
joy only if covered with soup stains and,
preferably, passed down from three
generations back (excluding band
leaders, professional dancers, and head
waiters), here in Sydney the reverse is
true. Englishmen who do arrive with
complete ruffles-and-bows regalia,
thinking they should make some sort of
effort, have been seen to mix unobtru-
sively with their Australian fashion-
conscious counterparts. The only man
I ever saw who stuck out a mile was
a Peer of the realm who, in an ill-
advised moment, wore lilac lace and
ruffles to a cocktail party. But that was
six months ago. Any color ruffles are
acceptable these days.
There are few men who travel abroad
who can resist returning without some
fashion item that is the hottest thing
in the past decade, and those who do
are misers. It has become a matter of
principle to reappear on the Australian
scene with at least some change in one’s
image, be it kipper tie, buckled boots,
or a new hairstyle. Last time round, the
thing was to bring back moccasins with
ornamental chains and wear Zapata
moustaches. Next time, according to
well-informed fashion sources, it will
be an agonising toss-up between Yul
Brynner baldness or Aristotle Onassis
aging flashiness.
There are, of course, drawbacks to

this increasing sartorial interest, the
first one being that it won’t be long
before men start looking better than
women. It takes more than a girl in
a bikini to stop traffic nowadays, in fact,
what it did take recently was a sun-
burnt man stripped to the waist in
Cardin-yellow flare-pants. The Sydney
lovely who says she wore a see-through
blouse without a bra and no one took
any notice was not joking. She has
now taken to see-in dresses. That is,
one looks down the decolletage rather
than through it. Presumably it is the
effort that makes it all worth while.
Then there is . the upkeep of it all.
Lighter and brighter colors for men
will automatically lead to longer and
drearier work for women. Girls who
know, know that a missing button from
a grey two-piece can go unnoticed for
months, but a gap in the middle of
what was, until yesterday, a set of
four gold buttons on a khaki raised-
twill double-breasted will need instant
attention. Worse still, it will need the
instant purchase of four more gold
buttons. Whoever heard of matching
gold singles? And if a man is to wear*
his pure silk Pesanti for not more than
three to four hours a day (“ . . . con-
stant wearing may tend to either make
it split or come apart at the seams . . .”),
then rush straight home to return it to
its hanger, who does the editor of
“Man About Town” suppose will get
lumbered with the job? And then, if
you please, hand out the 8-9 oz. light-
weight for replacement? The suggestion
that a man is capable of hanging his
suits in methodical order in his ward-
robe which, en passant, is supplemented
with half-a-dozen colored business
shirts to enable him to start the day
with a complete change of ensemble is,
to put it mildly, inaccurate. In our
house no day begins without a hysteri-
cal male cry of where are the socks,
followed by and the damn’d handker-
chiefs, too?
On the other hand, it may be that
in time things will even out. They
already are, in a way. “Darling, will
you do up my zip” is as much a male
as female request for assistance, refer-
ring, of course, to the zip of his turtle-
neck shirt. The visiting Peer said it was
hell when his lilac lace got jammed,
and one doesn’t doubt it. But the man
who ties a handkerchief round his neck
will need a great deal more practice
before he preaches he does it because it
■comes off easily, then chokes in the
attempt. So, too, will the man who takes
two days listing his sartorial needs for
skiing, viz: 20 pairs of socks, 15 sweaters,
two dozen shirts; then spends the whole
holiday wearing the same thing.
It is getting a grasp of these finer
points that men will find difficult. But,
unlike the man who wears a safety
pair of bathers beneath his surfers in
case they fall down, let’s not be too
pessimistic. I prefer to think that the
man who keeps two pairs of gardening
gloves, one on and one in the wash,
is already getting the hang of it.

to buckets, rubbish bins, kitchenware, or con-

they will be virtually unbreakable, unaffected
by boiling water, rigid, hygienic, easy to clean

AUSTRALIA SHOULD HAVE A GO
Comment by 'Observer’
IP MR. GORTON wants to start
considering how he could get on as
well with President Nixon as Mr. Holt
got on with President Johnson, he
could do worse than read the October
14 issue of The Bulletin last year. To
that issue Mr. Nixon contributed a
five-page article on the American role
in Asia which, at least until something
else crops up, might stand as a guide
to his likely pattern of thinking. It
was much consulted in Canberra last
week.
If the Prime Minister can’t spare
the time, someone on his staff might
care to refer to him these key sen-
tences from Mr. Nixon’s piece: “The
role of the United States as world
policeman is likely to be limited in the
future . . . Asia today needs its own
security undertakings, reflecting the
new realities of Asian independence
and Asian needs . . . The central
pattern of the future in U.S.-Asian
relations must be American support
for Asian initiatives.”
So far, in his period as Prime
Minister, Mr. Gorton, while suffocating
the attempts of Mr. Hasluck and Mr.
Fairhall to provide him with a foreign
policy, has not produced one of his
own, but from most of his off-the-cuff
speeches and the hints he has dropped
all over Canberra it seems clear that
the foreign policy with which he would
feel most at home is an isolationist
white-man’s tight little island parochial-
ism that is the exact opposite of how
Mr. Nixon is likely to see the Aus-
tralian role. The rumor is that on his
return from London next year he will
visit not the United States but Israel.
The essential thing about Mr. Nixon’s
most likely attitude is that it is much
the same as the State Department’s
attitude under President Johnson: that
it is time that Australia grew up and,
m its own neighborhood, took more of
the kind of initiatives that can be
expected of an independent-minded
regional power. It is not Australia’s
fault that its Government has not been
enheartened by this stimulus to new
action. . While they might be slow
in initiative (who isn’t?), ordinary
Australians may be more adaptable to
changes of direction (once they are
pointed out to them) than their
leaders usually give them credit for.
It is not the fault of the relevant
public-service departments or the rele-
vant Cabinet Ministers they seem
more or less ready. It is the fault of the
Prime Minister, who has simply held
Australian policy in suspension for 11
months. Where the imagination of
Harold Holt seemed to be enlivened by
the prospect of Australia entering new
fields of action, Mr. Gorton’s imagina-
tion seems to shrivel with the
unfamiliarity of such an idea: it is
not to his taste.
But how is he going to square off
with President Nixon, after they have
been photographed together on the
lawns of the White House? He’ll have
to do something better than pull the
Anzus Treaty out of his pocket and
go through the fine print. It is not
suggested that Australia need be Presi-
dent Nixon’s toady but that Mr.
Gorton, as a politician, must concern
himself with the intractabilities of
pov\ er, and that he should be thinking
of what he will say in defence of
Australia’s do-nothing policy, if that
policy continues. Perhaps he’ll have a
good answer: if he has one, perhaps
we could hear it now.
Like Mr. Whitlam, one of Mr.
Gorton’s interests in power seems to
have been in its mere assertion and
display. By this means he has affronted
the public service, some of his Cabinet
Ministers and backbenchers, the State
Liberal Premiers, the Liberal Party
machine, and the DLP. Does he
intend to affront the President of the
United States, too? Perhaps he does.
And, of course, there is no God-given
rule that he shouldn’t. But if he
doesn’t want to take on the U.S.A.
does he know what he is doing? And
if he does why?
So far as foreign policy is concerned,
Mr. Gorton may have been influenced
too much by the apocalyptic vision of
some of his friends. Their simplistic
interpretation that what must necessarily
happen next is (i) that the Americans
pull out, (ii) South-East Asia collapses
like a house of cards, and (iii) it’s
back to the old fortress can be offset
bv this quotation from Mr. Nixon’s
article, which raises a different possi-
bility: “The United States is a Pacific
power. Both our interests and our
ideals propel us westwards across the
Pacific, not as conquerors but as
partners, linked by the sea not only
with those oriental nations on Asia’s
Pacific littoral but at the same time
with occidental Australia and New
Zealand, and with the island nations
between.”
Mr. Holt was much laughed at for
befriending President Johnson. Yet it
seems a sensible thing for any Aus-
tralian Prime Minister to try to get
some special personal relationship with
a President of the United States. Mr.
Gorton will not be serving his country
well if he does not swallow his pride
and have a go. But he won’t be able
to do it on charm alone. He will have
to show that Australia will pay the
price of admission. On this occasion
the price is an acceptable one: it is
that Australia should act toward its
neighbors with the courage and gener-
osity of a nation whose wealth, despite
its small population, is greater than
that of the four of its most immediate
South-East Asian neighbors combined.
THE CASE OF PARAGRAPH 44
Comment by Alan Reid
A LOT MORE is going to be heard
before long about paragraph 44 of the
Tariff Board’s annual report. It reads:
“In the case of areas of production
which are found to have little prospect
of operating with an effective rate be-
, * ° , n i ~ *
low oO pei cent, the oai w° u no
recommend protection sufficient to
allow the industries concerned to com-
pete for resources on the same terms
as low-cost industries. In the case of
activities requiring an effective rate
of protection exceeding 25 percent but
not exceeding 50 percent, the Board
would be influenced by the likely effect
on other industries and their prospects
for more competitive production.”
There is political dynamite in that
rather prosy paragraph. Dr. Jim
Cairns (Vic.), Labor’s spokesman on
tariff matters, and his colleague Tom
Uren (Lab./ N.S.W.) appreciate its
political potential to enlist to Labor’s
side both manufacturers and workers
whose business and jobs exist because
of tariff protection. And they lit the
fuse in the House of Representatives
last week during a tariff debate.
Ti doing so, Caiins had to levise an
earlier attitude. On March 16, 1967, he
What is needed is a more mod-
f ate approach to protection than we
have now. Instead of providing more
and m ore protection to virtually what-
ever industries seek (tariff) assistance
we should deliberately select for assist-
ance only the less costly ventures.”
That was Cairns the economist speak-
ing. Since then there have been a pro-
cession of manufacturers parading be-
fore Labor committees handling trade
questions. Manufacturers can mean
Party support. The situation can also
represent a means of Labor’s working
upon the fears of employees in
industries operating behind a tariff
barrier.
It was a different Cairns from the
one of March last year who spoke
last week and said: “It would appear-
that the Tariff Board I do not
know whether it is backed by the
Government is beginning its work

of demolishing a significant part of
Australian secondary industry . . . the
plan that the Board envisages must
eventually result in serious unemploy-
ment in Australia. It must eventually
lead to the closing of significant sectors
of almost every industry.”
Shrewdly, Cairns tried to drive
deeper the tariff wedge which is already
beginning to divide John McEwen from
a section of his Country Party followers.
“Where is the Minister for Trade?”
Cairns demanded. “We are entitled to
know what he thinks about the tariff.”
Retorted Minister for the Interior
Peter Nixon (CP, Vic.), the Minister
at the centre table, “He is in Cabinet.”
Cairns: “He is almost always some-
where else. We never see him. There
is always a junior Country Party
Minister sitting at the table when these
matters for which the Minister for
Trade is responsible are being dis-
cussed.”
Uren backed up Cairns loyally. He
confirmed that there had been a pro-
cession of manufacturers into the Labor
lobby. “If the industries referred to
in paragraph 44 of the Tariff Board’s
report that need more than 50 percent
protection are no longer afforded that
protection, then a large proportion of
the 25,000 people in the (knitting)
industry will lose their employment.”
Cairns and Uren having lit the fuse,
it spluttered ominously.
Liberal Tony Street got stuck into
Cairns. He referred to “the incredible
change . . . that had led Dr. Cairns to
reject what as an economist he knew
and appreciated to be a sound approach
to the tariff problem and to return to
the traditional Labor Party fold ”
Street attacked the approach that
tariff protection should include protec-
tion of what manufacturers considered
“reasonable profitability.” He declared
himself as unsympathetic after studying
Carbon Carbide Australia Ltd.’s record
level profits for 1967/68. He said the
directors, in the same statement as that
announcing the record profit, stated
that it would be necessary to reduce
selling prices on some of the company’s
chemical and plastic profits as a result
of the Tariff Board’s decision to
eliminate or reduce support price
values.
“I congratulate the Board on its
review and the Government on accept-
ing it,” said Street, who, -despite having
been in Parliament only since 1966, has
a considerable following among Liberal
backbenchers.
But the depth of feeling that exists
on the tariff issue was shown by the
contrary view advanced by Andrew
Peacock (Lib., Vic.).
Said Peacock, “To me it is simply
amazing that the Government should
accept in an annual report such a basic
revision of tariff policy (as that con-
tained in paragraph 44) without insist-
ing that the Board should either hold
a public inquiry or state quite firmly
that there will be a debate on the
report in the Parliament . . .”
Clearly not all has been said that’s
going to be said about paragraph 44.


AUSTRALIA
Canberra’s world turns upside down
CANBERRA JUST
doesn’t know what to
make of the Americans
right now. Almost all
the existing conventional
wisdoms about them are
in the process of being
scrapped. From Gov-
ernment people, from
Ministers downwards,
there are mutters of
bewilderment, ex-
pressions of distrust, and
a good bit of earthy
abuse. For in the past
the United States of
America has for them
been a benevolent god,
to be treated with the
rituals of homage, and
looked toward in rever-
ence as the great source
of guidance and protec-
tion.
On the other side, the
Labor Party, in varying
degrees has seen the U.S. as the epitome
of evil, a hate-object on which to
spew out frustrations. But for them the
urbane progressiveness of people like
Eugene McCarthy, the latter Kennedys,
and J. K. Galbraith has turned such
Americans into their new hero-figures,
and the United States becomes more
complicated, much less a target for
generalised abuse.
Only the DLP, who have always said
that the Americans are quite fallible
friends whom Australia should use for
what they are worth, but not place any
faith in, have been able to maintain a
traditional attitude and to chant the
refrain: We told you so.
Following the pre-election actions of
President Johnson and the candidates
for his succession, the virtually unani-
mous feeling in the major parties was
that the old world was falling to pieces.
Labor men saw the hated old Texan
doing what they had never imagined
when he stopped the bombing. And the
Government saw the United States
apparently eat its words and break with
its South Vietnamese allies. Their most
common comment was “sell-out.”
Mr. Gorton realised that he had to
make a statement to Parliament, but
judged that the less said the better.
Minimum time was devoted to the Par-
liamentary debate, and Cabinet cut its
list of Government speakers to three,
excluding such Vietnam specialists as
Defence Minister Fairhall, Army Minis-
ter Lynch, and ex-Army Minister Mal-
colm Fraser.
The Prime Minister, whose speech had
been drafted as a full 25-minute job,
pruned it into a perfunctory ten-minute
statement. “It is not for us to make
positive statements about this or that
Air. Gorton at last week's Press conference
when the negotiations are at a difficult
stage/’ concluded Air Minister Freeth
at the end of his speech.
By and large, of the three depart-
ments concerned with foreign affairs,
the Defence and Prime Minister’s De-
partments accepted the simple parlia-
mentarian’s view that President John-
s on would now do almost anything to
get peace in Vietnam. When the race
was still on they felt that Mr. Hum-
phrey would accelerate the process of
withdrawal, and early Wednesday
afternoon, when the Democrat was
ahead, they were saying that Vietnam
was all over. Only when Mr. Nixon’s
victory was confirmed on Thursday
morning did hopes revive that there'was
a chance of South Vietnam being saved
from Ho Chi Minh.
But diplomats in the External Affairs
'Department seemed to see the Vietnam
developments in a more sympathetic
way. The Lyndon Johnson fans there
thought that the American administra-
tion was handling Vietnam well. They
wanted to stress the positive aspects
of the latest developments. It was not,
they said, a permanent and uncondi-
tional bombing halt as demanded by
North Vietnam and the long-time
critics of American policy. They
urged a close reading of the text of
LBT’s speech. This indicated, they said,
that the U.S. Vietnam £ommander,
General Abrams, had assured him of
the fact of North Vietnamese with-
drawal out of South Vietnam, deep into
sanctuaries in Laos, Cambodia, and
Central Vietnam.
There had been, they said, an actual
if unadmitted act of restraint on the
part of the enemy, and he was in no
position to threaten Allied troops on
the DMZ. The North
Vietnamese had made a
major concession addi-
tionally in conceding the
right of the South Viet-
namese Government,
previously denounced as
representing no one, to
attend the enlarged
talks, and President
Johnson had made it
pretty clear that the con-
tinuance of the talks and
the bombing halt de-
pended on North Viet-
nam maintaining mili-
tary restraint specifically
respecting the DMZ and
holding off rocket
attacks on South Viet-
namese cities. Defence
Secretary Clifford had
said Abrams had orders
to resume any bombing
if it was needed for the
protection of U.S.
troops. Mr. Johnson had emphasised
that progress toward talks had come
because of the achievements of Allied
troops and the growing strength of the
South Vietnamese Government. It was
not, therefore, a sign of weakness, but
of strength that the bombing could be
halted.
They pointed out that much of the
President’s speech consisted of calls for
patience and references to the pro-
tracted nature of the Korean War
negotiations; and that he also spoke
of his objective in his remaining
months as President, as being a move-
ment toward, not an achievement of,
peace. So they concluded there was
no hint of the peace-at-any-price which
the parliamentarians and other depart-
ments envisaged.
These optimists also claimed there
was no lasting problem caused by the
presence of NLF representatives at the
Paris talks. There would be only three
Governments at the talks and the NLF
would be attending in an undefined
capacity as members of “the other
side.” The South Vietnamese, quite
understandably, wanted a clear state-
ment that the NLF would be at the
talks as members of the Hanoi delega-
tion. The Americans would have liked
to have produced this but couldn’t do
it without denials from the Communist
side. It was a pity the Allies had to
have a public argument on the issue,
though South Vietnamese assertions of
independence had their value. But it
was being argued that President Thieu
would eventually send his representa-
tive to Paris and that his present stance
was simply part of the initial propa-
ganda skirmishing.
The Government’s case in the parlia-


mentary debate was greatly weakened
by its failure to spell out these argu-
ments, but the worst mistake was made
in a tentative, unprepared speech by
Trade Minister McEwen, who described
the bombing halt as “a great act of
faith.”
This was seized upon by Labor’s Dr.
Cairns, who seemed to believe the
assertion that Hanoi had given no
guarantees of reciprocity, that the NLF
had made no concessions, and that the
whole affair was a Communist victory
and an American climb-down.
Labor speakers deployed their
familiar rhetoric, saying that the Viet-
nam war proved that Communism
could not be resisted by military means,
and that for America “there will be
no more Vietnams.” Many Govern-
ment members seemed to agree with
the latter proposition, too, giving it
Nixon in Australia in 1965
the extended meaning that the Ameri-
cans would abandon South-East Asia.
But of course the proposition that
there will be no more Vietnams does
not mean that the Americans are
necessarily finished as a power in Asia.
There will be no more Vietnams for the
same reason that there will be no more
Crimean Wars: Vietnam is a unique
historical phenomenon. The fact that
America does not want to get involved
in another war like Vietnam does not
mean very much in itself because
there isn’t likely to be another war very
like Vietnam.
One of the documents most in
demand last week from the Parlia-
mentary Library, from the External
Affairs Department (and from The
Bulletin’s Canberra bureau) was
Richard Nixon’s “Asia After Viet-
nam,” republished from the U.S.
“Foreign Affairs” quarterly as a cover
story (in The Bulletin, October 14,
1967). It is being recommended by the
Department of External Affairs as the
definitive statement of the new Presi-
dent’s foreign policy.
Four important inferences can be
drawn from the article and Mr.
Nixon’s subsequent statements:
1. That Mr. Nixon, far from being
a Europe-firster, like many in the
Johnson administration, may see the
Asian and Pacific region as being of
principal importance to the United
States.
2. That Mr. Nixon will neither
involve the U.S. in massive unilateral
interventions like Vietnam, nor with-
draw completely from Asia.
3. That Mr. Nixon sees the basis for
this new conditional U.S. assistance in
a regional security organisation like
ASPAC, much of the strength of which
would, in his view, have to be provided
by Japan and Australia.
4. That Mr. Nixon expects regional
initiatives and does not want syco-
phancy and mere flag-waving from
allies.
Canberra’s trouble is that it retains
too much of the colonial mentality, in
which the role of the junior partner is
seen as waiting to see what the great
and powerful friend does next, whereas
Mr. Nixon is saying that junior partners
must now take many of the initiatives.
Far from thinking of initiatives, the
conservatives in the Government are
already muttering that Australia cannot
do anything about its foreign policy
until it knows what Mr. Nixon is going
to do. There is renewed talk in high
places of again deferring the defence
review on this account. “Yes, I know
we said earlier that we’d have the
review done this year, but it’s not
right,” said one senior man in Can-
berra last week. “It will be much wiser
to forget all that and leave it until
President Nixon is really settled in.”
THE PRIME MINISTER
MIDNIGHT LIGHT
DURING the two weeks before the
bombing halt, all the key cables coming
into Canberra on the state of diplomatic
play were given unprecedently high
security treatment. For some time they
went only to the Prime Minister and
his departmental head, Mr. C. Hewitt.
Toward the end, senior External
Affairs Department officers were let in
on the news, and Defence Minister
Fairhall was filled in. But, in the
External Affairs Department, senior
desk officers were completely cut off,
and so in the Defence Department was
the whole of the Joint Intelligence
Bureau.
What was particularly puzzling to
these officials was that late one night,
after being at the theatre, Mr. Gorton
called in the few journalists who still
happened to be around and gave a
“midnight Press conference.” There, he
gave out with more than most of his
top advisers knew.
DA COSTA
NOT SO ACADEMIC
CABINET MET last Wednesday night
to decide the fate of Portuguese sailor
Manuel Da Costa. His final appeal
against his death sentence for murder
had failed, and it was time for the
Government to decide whether he
should die or not.
In public and in off-the-record com-
ments, Ministers had said that it was
ten-to-one against him hanging, and
that the reason for the delay in com-
muting the sentence was that this would
be an interference with the process of
appeals. There were seven stays of
execution while the appeals proceeded,
each one drawing more public atten-
tion to the case.
In fact, it turns out there was a
chance the Government would execute
Da Costa. A small number of Cabinet
Ministers are strongly in favor of the
death sentence, and few are strongly
against it. But, by the time the affair
had gone all the way up to the Privy
Council and got into the spotlight of
publicity, the hangers lost heart and
decided to play safe. Attorney-General
Nigel Bowen, a mild anti-hanger,
handled the affair so as to prevent an
execution and his supporters could argue
that an execution would look especially
bad while the House of Representatives
has before it an abolitionist Bill sent
down from the Senate.
Until March of this year the Com-
monwealth Territories had the death
sentence for ten offences, being about
where most States were in the 19205.
You could theoretically be hanged in
Canberra, for piracy (on the lake?),
attempted murder, rape, carnal know-
ledge of a girl under ten, breaking and
entering and doing grievous bodily
harm, arson, setting fire to or casting
away or by any means destroying any
vessel which is afloat, any person being
in such a vessel, and, finally, the venal
crime of maliciously masking, altering,
or removing any light or signal with
intent to bring any vessel or boat into
danger. It was all rather academic as
far as the A.C.T. was concerned, since
Da Costa...no death sentence


it doesn’t even have a jail (it uses Goul-
burn’s) let alone a gallows, and no
Canberra person has ever been hanged.
But it had real application to the
Northern Territory, where there is a
tradition of hanging which compares
with the hanging States of Western
Australia and South Australia, and the
real swinging jail at Darwin’s Fanny
Bay.
Interestingly, in the Federal Parlia-
ment there are few people who will
argue for retention of the death penalty.
When the abolitionist Bill was before
the Senate, most of the opposing
speakers concentrated on the inap-
propriateness of the Senate taking an
initiative.
Anti-hangers in the Federal Parlia-
ment are sure they can get agreement
in the Cabinet on abolition, if they are
able to devise a law which ensures that
lax Parole Boards do not allow con-
victed murderers out. They say that
this fear is the main force for reten-
tion.
McEWEN HOUSE
AN INTERNAL AFFAIR
THE COUNTRY PARTY has never
been very strong on research and organ-
isation, especially at the Federal level.
Around election time it has always
relied heavily on the Department of
Trade and Industry for ideas, speakers’
notes, and speech drafts. In the 1966
election there was quite a scandal when
a large part of the Department was
turned on to electioneering. At present
the Party doesn’t have a single full-time
Federal officer, not even an office girl.
But at its next Federal Council
meeting it plans to remedy that and
maybe at the next election it will be
able to rely more on its own resources
and less on the Trade Department. It
plans a staff consisting of a Federal
secretary and a research officer, plus a
couple of girls.
These will be quartered in the grand
$300,000 McEwen House, which was
opened in Canberra recently with all
appropriate ceremony and a Prime
Ministerial speech. What people
immediately began asking was: if the
Country Party staff is only to be four,
what will happen to the rest of the
12,500 - square - foot building? The
answer is that 11,100 feet of it is beiny
leased to the Department of External
Affairs.
In answer to a question by DLP
Leader Gair last week, the Government
revealed that the rent being paid is
$3.75 a square foot. This does not, as
some people had suspected, give an
extortionate rate of return to the
Country Party, since the building cost
$22.40 a foot to build. A gross return of
17 percent a year is comparable with
rents being charged to Government
Departments in other privately owned
office buildings in the area.
The more telling criticisms being
levelled against the deal are different.
First, that it simply looks bad. The
At opening last
week: Mrs. Mc-
Ewen, John
Gorton, John
McEwen, Mrs.
Gorton
Country Party is only creating a
Federal organisation after its prestige
office building has been created, and it
looks as though the salaries of those
Party workers are being paid with the
$41,000 rent of the External Affairs
Department, which is occupying most
of the building.
Second, it happens that it is the aid
section of the External Affairs Depart-
ment which is moving into McEwen
House, and that looks bad, too. For the
Country Party has a very direct interest
in the items which the Government
decides to give as aid and the prices
it pays for them.
Third, the office space being occupied
in McEwen House is extremely expen-
sive, not because the Country Party
is getting an excessively good whack
as landlord, but because it outlaid a
huge amount for a prestige building.
The Government can build itself office
space in Canberra for about $l4 a foot,
compared to the $22-a-foot space of
McEwen House. But because of a gen-
eral lag in the rate of Government
office construction in Canberra, an
excessive number of public servants are
housed in private offices, altogether
over 300,000 ft. of private office space
is being rented, much of it at $4 and $5
a foot. But using modular standardised
designs by Department of Works
architect, James MacCormick, the Com-
monwealth can provide its own fully
air-cortditioned space at a cost equiv-
alent to less than $2 a foot annua lb .
AIRPORTS
SNAPPING AT AIR
CRITICS OF the Australian Parlia-
ment usually point to its tame com-
mittees as one of the system’s biggest
failures to provide a check on the
executive. Until recently the Parlia-
mentary Public Works Committee was
no exception to the rule. It merely
rubber-stamped Government proposals
for all major Federal building proposals
and its reports were usually no more
controversial than to question whether
a new post office at Darwin should
have air-conditioning for customers and
a tea-urn for staff.
But in recent weeks the committee
has suddenly developed teeth. The
Department of Civil Aviation, run by
the unflappable Mr. Reg Swartz, was
the first to feel the bite. The com-
mittee, headed by Mr. Fred Chaney,
the former Minister for the Navy, has
been delving into proposals for new
works at the major airports in Sydney
and Melbourne, and it has come up
with a scathing indictment of Federal
Government civil aviation policy.
In both cases the committee found
that civil .aviation policy lacked the
overall planning and imagination neces-
sary to meet the needs of Australia’s
growing aircraft traffic and showed
surprising inconsistencies.
At Sydney Airport the Government
had adopted a “wait-and-see” policy on
the need for a 13,000 ft. runway to
cater for the new “jumbo” jets due to
be delivered to Qantas in August, 1971.
Because of this delay, the runway will
not be completed until early 1972. And
the big jets would have to operate with
a weight or range penalty out of Syd-
ney until then.
The Government also had failed to
push on with development of the new
domestic-airline terminals at Sydney,
a failure which will produce chaotic
conditions there in the next five years.
The committee summed up its observa-
tions on development work at Mascot:
“The committee believes that if the
Government intends to provide facili-
ties commensurate with the needs of
modern civil aviation, then clearly it
has a responsibility to plan with more
energy and imagination than has been
shown in this instance.”
At Melbourne’s new Tullamarine
Airport the committee found equally
serious construction delays and lack of
planning. The airport’s $l2-million
pavement Works had been completed
iwo years before required and is lying
idle in the meantime.
The committee also had a much
sterner look at the Government’s
departure from established policy in
financing the $ll million maintenance
bases for the two domestic airlines at
Tullamarine. By leasing the facilities
to TAA and Ansett-ANA it is recouping
its investment plus interest at percent
over 40 years. Noting that both the
Government and the airlines in 1965
expected the airlines would provide
their own facilities at Tullamarine, the
committee said it was concerned at this
development. The Civil Aviation
Department had supplied the committee
with confidential information on the
change in policy and the committee


concluded that “although we do not
necessarily agree with the principles
underlying the decision, we realise that
the Government had little alternative.”
One reason for the committee’s new
teeth is that Mr. Chaney, dropped
from the Ministry by the late Mr. Holt
when he was Prime Minister, is
obviously anxious to prove his worth as
an active committee chairman. Another
is that one committee member, Sydney
Liberal Mr. Len Bosnian, is chairman
of the Government Members Civil
Aviation Committee and a critic of
some civil aviation policies. Mr. Bos-
nian recently described the Govern-
ment’s $ll-million allocation for the
airline maintenance bases at Tulla-
marine as nothing more than a sop to
get the airlines to move from Essendon
to Tullamarine.
PARLIAMENT
DEATH OF A BILL
“THE LEADER of the Opposition has
been in Opposition for so long he
would like the feeling of power of
introducing legislation.” So said Peter
Nixon, Minister for the Interior, in the
House of Representatives last week.
No doubt Opposition Leader Whitlam
would like the feeling of power, but
his proposal to give Senate representa-
tion to both the A.C.T. and Northern
Territory seemed to deserve a some-
what less churlish reply from the
guardian of Australia’s electoral law.
The proposal, in the form of a
Private Member’s Bill, which has
languished on the House notice paper
since March 20, provides for two
Senators for each Territory. Mr. Whit-
lam envisaged Territory Senators being
elected with each House of Representa-
tives election, normally every three
years compared with the six years
given to Senators from the States.
Since with the proportional syste’m of
voting for the Senate one Labor and
one Liberal Senator would be installed
every three years, the balance of power
in the Upper House would remain un-
changed'but residents of the Territories
would have a few more voices sup-
porting their cause - and voices of
differing political color.
Mr. Whitlam argued that the
Constitution required that all Austra-
lians should have a full share in
selecting their lawmakers, and that this
meant the Territories should be repre-
sented in both Houses. Labor was
pledged to abolish the Senate, he ad-
mitted, but he pointed out that in his
view at least this was less urgent than
other changes in the Constitution. In
any case, while a bicameral system
existed, all Australians should be repre-
sented in both chambers.
Along with charges of “political
opportunism” and “sour grapes,” Mr.
Nixon managed to bring up Labor’s
rejection of its A.C.T. Member, Mr.
Jim Fraser (defeated in a now disputed
pre-selection ballot a few weeks ago).
He went on with a eulogy of Mr.
Gough Whitlam ... jour more Senators?
Fraser words he might regret if the
ALP State executive upsets the A.C.T.
selection and puts Mr. Fraser back as
Labor’s candidate. Then he accused
Mr. Whitlam of having “a policy for
all seasons,” and using the line (curious
for a Country Party MP) that Mr.
Whitlam had abandoned the “one vote
one value” principle.
The Minister spent only a few
moments on the valid claim that the
States, for whom the Senate was
designed as a guardian, might object
to representation for the Territories.
“The people of the States may regard
this as a political trick to change the
balance of power in the Senate,” he
added, but then, instead of elaborating,
he went on to continue his denunciation
of the Opposition Leader.
The debate finished before there was
time for the next Government speaker,
Attorney-General Nigel Bowen, who
might have made a more valid contri-
tion than his Country Party colleague.
Mr. Whitlam’s Bill now passes to the
bottom of the notice paper. Judging
from Mr. Nixon’s attitude, and the
large volume of other non-Government
business, that’s where it will stay.
POWER IN S.A..
BLOCKING THE WEDGE
“WE HAVE heard the word gerry-
mander so often that most people now
realise it is not a second-grade orange”
said the LCL Member for Onkaparinga,
Mr. S. G. Evans, in the South Aus-
tralian House of Assembly during the
debate on the Government’s electoral
Bill. Mr. Evans was voicing the disquiet
a number of LCL Members feel about
the Bill which sets up an Electoral
Commission comprised of a Supreme
Court Judge, the Surveyor General, and
the State Returning Officer, whose job
it will be to divide the State into 47
House of Assembly seats instead of the
present 39. He went on to say that if
the Bill were passed, “We will be out
on our ears at the next election. No one
can say this Bill provides for a gerry-
mander.”
The somewhat acrimonious debate
revolved around the respective country
and city quotas the Commissioners will
be required to use in drawing up the
boundaries. A State quota will be
struck by dividing the number of
voters on the Assembly rolls by
47. A metropolitan quota would then
be established at 15 percent above the
State quota, balancing out to probably
28 metropolitan seats and 19 country
seats. The metropolitan seats can be
ten percent above or below their quota,
while the country seats can be 15 per-
cent above or below.
If some LCL Members were worried
by the apparent readiness of the Govern-
ment to dispense with those electoral
privileges that gave their Party decades
of power, Labor Members were just as
concerned about the real effect of the
quotas and spent much of their time
in debate arguing to have the country
quota reduced to 10 percent. Finally,
Opposition Leader Don Dunstan said
that his Party supported the Bill with
“reluctance,” for while it did not pro-
vide for a fair distribution, his Party
thought it was certainly an improve-
ment on the present system. He said
that though the ALP is prepared to let
the Bill through, it would reserve the
right to scrutinise the Commissioners’
report before the final Constitution
Amendment Bill was introduced; an
obvious warning that the Opposition is
not prepared to agree easily on many
aspects of the new distribution.
One lonely voice in the debate was
that of the Speaker, Mr. Stott, who
must have found his position unusually
frustrating. The independent member
for Ridley, he has very strong views on
proportional representation, but found
that, as Speaker, he could not introduce
his own Bill for the system; and, when
the House was in Committee, attempt-
ing to extend the Commissioners’ terms
of reference, he was ruled out of order
by the chairman. He remarked, some-
what forlornly, afterward, that there
did not appear to be much support on
either side of the House for propor-
tional representation. To observers, this
is understandable. Proportional repre-
sentation could mean House of Assembly
seats for the DLP and the newly
formed South Australian Country
Party, and neither main Party relishes
the confusions that would then occur
in the club.
Now, with the Assembly Electoral
Bill before it, the Legislative Council
has two major electoral reform
measures to ponder, though last week
it was the one providing full adult
franchise for the Council which received
the most immediate attention. In
debate, Sir Arthur Rymill’s question to
the Opposition Leader, Mr. Shard

indicated the feelings of the old guard
toward the open franchise when he
growled “Is not the real purpose of
this Bill to abolish the Legislative
Council? This is the thin end of the
wedge.”
But in the Council the LCL is by
no means presenting a solid front on
the Bill. When Sir Arthur moved for
an adjournment of the debate until
the Council’s chief apologist, Chief
Secretary Degaris, was available to
speak, Agriculture Minister Story, and
another Councillor, crossed to vote with
the Opposition against the motion,
indicating that two of its Members at
least are democrats and are prepared
to stand up and be counted.
ABORIGINES
NEW DEAL IN N.S.W.
ONE YEAR AGO the most compre-
hensive inquiry into conditions of
Aborigines that has ever been prepared
by any Government, State or Federal,
in Australia was tabled in the N.S.W.
Parliament. The inquiry was held under
the chairmanship of Mr. G. R. Craw-
ford (now Minister for Agriculture),
and was supported by all Parties. The
Crawford Committee investigated every
Aboriginal centre, reserve, or camp in
the State, examined scores of expert
witnesses, from professors and public
servants to Mr. Michael Sawtell and
Mr. Charles Perkins, took 13,000 sworn
answers covering haemoglobin count
(low), inland infant mortality rate
(high), rent arrears (very high, totalling
$172,500 by 1966), venereal disease
(high in Bourke), school dropouts
(appallingly high after second-form high
school), and population (15,000 inland,
up to 15,000 in Sydney, and only 127
full-blood altogether). The committee
also prepared a legislation program, and
the Bill was finally introduced on Wed-
nesday, November 6.
The report recommended abolishing
the Aborigines Welfare Board, under
Chief Secretary Willis, its replacement
Willis in “Dawn” magazine
by an all-Aboriginal Advisory Council
with a policy of encouraging Aborigines
to leave reserves, the take-over of
housing policy by the Housing Com-
mission, an educational program for
pre-school to technical colleges and
universities, the leasing of arable land
on reserves to Aboriginal farmers, and
the establishing of an employment ser-
vice. It opposed the South Australian-
type anti-discrimination legislation and
rejected the idea of repaying Aborigines
for lost lands.
The Bill adopting these proposals,
introduced into the N.S.W. Parliament
last week, will have an easy passage,
and its pragmatic flavor should give it a
good chance of success in practice. One
problem noted by the committee is
that of communication between Govern-
ment and Aborigines. The Welfare
Board produces a magazine called
“Dawn,” which it sends to all Abor-
igines. All Aborigines questioned by
the committee said they read it; but
none knew anything about the housing
scheme which had been expounded in
it. The committee thought the maga-
zine needed jazzing up. Aborigines, they
implied, are not necessarily public
servants trained to read' the Govern-
ment gazette. This shows the right
approach. For a start, they could con-
sider scrapping the name “Dawn,” which
has a patronising sound, whatever its
original intention.
ENGINEERS' CASE
NO FLOW-THROUGH?
THE MONTH’S argument in the third
major Professional Engineers’ case has
only scratched the surface of the
evidence which will be presented to the
Arbitration Commission during the
hearing.
It is an argument that seeks salary
distinction for the largest employee
professional group in Australia (only
five percent are self-employed) and
which denies that these claims should
represent a test case or spearhead, from
the results of which sub-professional
groups could launch “flow-through”
claims.
Whether the engineers can shake off
the white-collar organisations clinging
to their coattails is another matter. Both
the success or the failure of these far-
reaching claims will have reverberating
consequences. If the Commission follows
its approach in the previous cases, it
will make a judgment about the relative
value to the engineer in the technical
society he has helped to create. In
effect, the Commission will be helping to
assess how socially crucial the engineer
is.
If the Commission does not favor the
engineers’ claims the participation of
professional engineers in national Arbi-
tration may be in jeopardy. The Associ-
ation has not discounted the possi-
bility that its 20 years of by-and-large
successful participation in the system
might be brought to an end.

The man who is Nixon
INTERNATIONAL
Richard Nixon and Spiro Agnew at breakfast after their victory—UPI photo
IN AMERICA, criticism of Mr. Nixon
has been sustained for more than 20
years. But it is not so much for what
he has done but for what Americans
at the liberal intellectual end of the
social scale suppose him to be that
he is most often condemned.
Many irrelevant straws have helped
to break the camel's back of. tolerance.
Much is made of his uneducated palate,
as if a preference for hamburgers and
pineapple malteds somehow rendered
a man unfit to lead the Western world.
A similar emphasis is put upon his
ugliness, which is admittedly out-
standing.
He has thick and heavy eyebrows
and black hair with a blunted widow’s
peak: the suggestion that he dyes it is
made in tones which imply that by so
doing he has broken faith with the
founding fathers. Below the ridgebone
of his forehead, his jowled face seems
entirely boneless and loose, as if (in
the words of one close and hostile
examiner) it was too big for what it
covered, like the skin of a tangerine.
His five-o’clock shadow is there almost
all day, and because of some peculiarity
in his skin condition is exposed by
television cameras, even when it is
invisible to the naked eye.
His nose has been justly called
grotesque. It is large and, running down
from top to tip, has a wide, flat track
described by at least one American
cartoonist, with vocational affection,
as “the ski-slope.” It will be recalled
that Cyrano de Bergerac, one of the
noblest characters in French romance,
had a similar conk. Yet it is the edu-
cated American, the one most likely to
have heard of this Gascon precedent
and to draw from it the conclusion that
there is no necessary connection
between a man’s ugliness and his nature,
who insists that Mr. Nixon’s physical
appearance, exposed to the nation in
the first of those great TV debates in
the 1960 Presidential campaign, rightly
contributed to his defeat by the late
John Kennedy.
Criticis'm of greater substance has,
of course, been levelled against the new
President. From the start he has been
identified by those who dislike him as
the plastic politician. He is considered
to be a notable end-product of a great
piece of motivational research, under-
taken by Madison Avenue experts on
behalf of the Republican Party, which
Mr. Nixon had recently joined, to
determine the attributes needed in the
perfect American candidate. After that
he was taken in hand by a Mr. Murray
Chotiner, a political - campaigning
specialist whose handbook on the sub-
ject has been compared favorably with
Machiavelli’s “The Prince.” The idea
that Mr. Nixon is some kind of com-
puter, geared to produce the right
answer in any situation, was fostered
in the recent campaign by at least
one of his Press critics. She wrote that
his aides on the campaign trail no
longer spoke of “briefing” him about
the local election issues, but about
“programming the candidate.”
Evidently, the aim has been to
present Mr. Nixon as a man without
political passion or personal conviction


who thinks of winning campaigns as an
end in itself. But this image of him as
an entirely mechanical man has been
somewhat impaired by other critics who
speak of his exceptional mental agility,
though not to praise him. They concede
that he can think swiftly on his feet,
but do so only to show him as a man
who at once modifies any rare declara-
tion of attitude the moment he senses
that it has not gone down well with his
audience. They see his voting record,
both as Congressman and as Senator,
not as being accidentally well balanced
but as a masterpiece of deliberate con-
trivance, with every expression of
opinion so skilfully cancelled out by its
opposite that neither side could con-
demn him as an obvious enemy.
But, in the end, liberal criticism of
Mr. Nixon has alw'ays swung round
again to disparagement of a personal
kind. By this account, he behaves as he
does because he is basically a tasteless
and insensitive human being. The late
John Kennedy put it in a nutshell found
widely acceptable when he said that
Mr. Nixon had “no class.” The infer-
ence has always been that he remains
untouched by the refining influences of
American civilisation and has stood out
awkwardly on the Washington scene as
a Californian parvenu beyond redemp-
tion.
It is necessary to go far back into
the Nixon record to discover to what
extent the new President has been mis-
judged or misrepresented. The image
of Nixon as the raw American must
surely be the first to go. His ancestry
goes almost as far back as white
ancestry can in North America and
includes many genteel influences.
On the maternal or Milhous side of
the family, a kinsman is said to have
reached Delaware in 1690. Nor were
these first Milhous settlers the normal
Irish refugees from potato shortage.
They were Irish Quakers. That unpre-
possessing face, so often offered to us
as plain evidence of Nixon’s un-
reliability, comes to him from Milhous
ancestors, who for generations had
made it a symbol of probity.
The Milhouses pioneered, first of all
southward, only to recoil from a slave-
based society, then back to Indiana,
where they ran one of the most effective
stations on the “underground railroad”
for escaping Negroes. In the late 19th
century a large Milhous family unit—
including the new President’s mother,
Hannah Milhous—made its way into
California on one of the first waves of
mass migration to the limits of the
American West.
Richard Nixon is almost as deeply
established in the land on his father’s
side. A James Nixon—also from Ireland
—landed in Delaware in 1753. A Nixon
forefather crossed the Delaware with
Washington: another was killed at
Gettysburg. The Nixons were
Methodists, who sank their roots mainly
in the farmland of the Mid-West. Both
sides of the family included preachers
and teachers.
One of the mistakes Mr. Nixon made
in the 1960 campaign was to discard
the glamor of this all-American back-
ground. Paced with an opponent
gleaming with inherited wealth and
educated as a toff, he chose instead to
play up the grim nature of his own
early struggles. It was not a difficult
ploy, because his father, Prank Nixon,
was anything but a glamorous figure
a tram-driver. He went to Cali-
fornia in search 'of a climate more
congenial to a tram-driver’s feet, hav-
ing himself suffered frostbite on
exposed driving platforms in Columbus,
Ohio. Lrom a job on the trolley-
routes of Los Angeles, he progressed to
the ownership of a small lemon grove
and then of a petrol station and country
store, where he was reasonably suc-
cessful.
But in 1960 Mr. Nixon preferred to
dwell on the deprivations of his boy-
hood, hoping to make an odious com-
parison. Mutely inviting his audiences
to visualise a vast Kennedy nursery
cluttered with expensive electric-train
sets, he told of his own yearnings for a
simple “wind-up” train and of how
these had been frustrated by the family’s
need to buy groceries.
No this won Mr. Nixon many
sympathisers. But these tales of spartan
life at the filling station had other, per-
haps ill-considered, effe.cts. To Ameri-
cans who wished for “style” in their
President, they identified Mr. Nixon
as a “common” sort of man, belonging
to an American lower middle-class
“without looks or distinction or wealth:
without intelligence and without
curiosity in their eyes.”
But, in fact, the account Mr. Nixon
then gave of his own setting was essen-
tially untrue. His boyhood had cer-
tainly not been an easy one. But his
foundations in Whittier —the small Cali-
fornian town where he grew up and
later practised as a law 7 yer- —are far
more substantial and respectable than
is suggested by the images of a foot-
loose, gas-station life he had himself
evoked. The town was founded as a
tranquil Quaker settlement with a long
view of the ocean. In this community,
those on the Milhous side of the family
were citizens of substance, with whom
Nixon’s father readily aligned himself,
adopting their faith. Whittier is now a
suburb of Los Angeles, but it still
retains its solid, well-ordered respect-
ability. It is visibly the home of that
good, plain Republican sentiment to
which the new President has always
adhered. The American student revolt,
now in such ferment across the land,
has done little to, disturb the campus
of Whittier College, the private institu-
tion to which Nixon went on a Milhous
scholarship. It houses 1500 large, clean,
healthy students and there isn’t a hippie
in sight.
Even so, although young Nixon quali-
fied for Harvard Law School, he did
not go there, because his parents could
not afford it. He went instead to Duke
University in North Carolina, an obscure
Methodist college which had just been
inflated to university status by vast
endowments from a tobacco millionaire
and which offered lush scholarships to
attract brainy young men. Nixon did
well there and was a big man
on campus, chiefly because of a start-
ling talent for debate. But he suffered
all the same from spasms of self-doubt:
he was known as “Gloomy Gus” because
even in his moments of greatest triumph
he saw himself threatened by imminent
failure, and one may suspect that his
red-brick imprint helped to foster that
sense of purely social inferiority, later
to trouble him in his contacts with the
patronising Ivy Leaguers of the East.
It has often been said that Nixon’s
choice of the Republican Party was a
cynical one, made without regard for
its principles and simply because it
had invited him to stand as a candidate.
Actually, the choice was not only the
natural one for a person with Nixon’s
background: it was also in a sense quite
brave, since at that time most politically
ambitious young men saw the
Democrats cresting the wave of the
future. And, anyway, he registered as
a Republican in 1938, long before he
had any thought of being a candidate
and before he went off to the war
in this he served as a naval officer
at the Pacific battleline, though not
quite close enough to justify his cam-
paign references to “talks I had with
our boys in the foxholes.”
It was in 1946 that Mr. Nixon first
ran, in California, for Congress. He
campaigned as a fervent anti-
Communist and established a reputa-
tion which is with him still and is
thought to cast doubt, not only on his
ethical standards, but on on his real
attitude toward the war in Vietnam.
He says now that for historical reasons
anti-Communism was then the mood of
the American hour and that he was far
from being uniquely involved. But he
and his aides took the battle to his
opponent a decent leftish Democrat
named Jerry Voorhis with an exper-
tise which was exceptionally ruthless.
In Washington, Mr. Nixon was
chosen for the House Committee on
Un-American Activities. An appoint-
ment reckoned enviable because of
the publicity that went with it would
scarcely have gone to someone so young
if he were not already recognised as a
hammer of the Reds. In 1948, as a
member of this committee, Mr. Nixon
won himself national prominence as
main prosecutor in the Hiss case.
It is clearly the role he played in
this case that earned for him what
someone has called “the irrational
hatred” of American liberals. They
thought it both unjust and inhuman to
“persecute” a distinguished man like
Hiss for the Communist “loyalties” that


had moved him in an earlier and quite
different decade.
Evidently detached from feelings
such as these, Mr. Nixon hounded Hiss
to his ruin. Certainly he did this in
the Republican interest. He was clearly
as anxious to expose the Democrats for
being “soft on Communism” as he was
to prove that Hiss had been a Com-
munist spy. Perhaps he was also a
little moved by “class” feeling to show
that a man with the sensibility and
social poise that Nixon himself was
supposed to lack could still be a traitor.
But, if on this occasion he seemed short
of compassion, one may be sure it was
above all because he was convinced that
Hiss represented a serious danger to the
State and especially to the free-
enterprise America in which, as a good
Republican, Mr. Nixon wholly believed.
In the Hiss case allowing for the
relatively easy-going nature of the
American legal process Mr. Nixon
operated as a proper lawyer. Those who
are qualified to judge believe it is
because of his qualities as a lawyer, and
not his political connections, that for
the past six years he has been the
r 5200,000-a-year senior partner in an
eminent Wall Street law firm, with a
de-luxe white-and-gold apartment on
Fifth Avenue. And there is good reason
to suppose that, as an anti-Communist,
it was his devotion to firm evidence
which separated him from the often
irresponsible procedures of the
Un-American Activities Committee
and from the reckless cruelty of the
late Senator Joe McCarthy.
At all events, it was Mr. Nixon’s fervor
as a Red-hunter—confirmed in 1950 by
yet another ruthless Californian cam-
paign, this time for the Senate and
against the Liberal Helen Douglas—that
led to his being chosen in 1952, and
again in 1956, as General Eisenhower’s
Vice-President. Those who see the Vice-
Presidency as no more than a dull seat
in the waiting-room were perhaps sur-
prised to hear Mr. Nixon tell David
Frost one night last week he thought
this his period of greatest achievement.
It is true that he made many journeys
abroad, wrangled with Khrushchev in
Moscow in the celebrated “kitchen
debate,” and showed courage in Latin-
American riot situations which a really
prudent man might not have entered in
the first place. It is also true that
Eisenhower’s alarming illnesses gave Mr.
Nixon’s post more importance than
usual.
But Eisenhower himself once told a
Press conference it would take him a
week to think of anything his Deputy-
had done. It is still not clear whether
the President was being facetious or
whether this was another instance of
his curious failure to offer Mr. Nixon
prompt support when he needed it. Mr.
Nixon is best known for his use of
respectable cliches, but to this period
belongs his one classic remark:
“General, there comes a time in politics
when you must either pee or get off
the pot.” On the whole it seems
unlikely that the General ever meant
seriously to harm his second-in-
command. Mr. Nixon is still devoted
to him, and the two families are
shortly to be joined by the marriage of
•Nixon’s younger daughter, Julie, to
David Eisenhower.
Two more campaigns lay ahead of
Mr. Nixon, both of them disastrous
his narrow defeat by John Kennedy for
the Presidency in 1960, his humiliating
defeat by Pat Brown for the Governor-
ship of California in 1962. It was after
the second of these that he made his
bitter attack on American newspaper
reporters, few of whom had ever
concealed their dislike of him. It is
an outburst Mr. Nixon now regrets, but
at least it showed him capable of
ordinary human emotion. In fact, some
people are sure he is anything but the
cold, mechanical fish he has been made
out to be. In another interview Mr.
Nixon agreed that most of his life
seemed to have been spent campaigning
and that once he would have defined
success as “just winning.” “But,” he
went on, “now that I’ve been every-
thing Congressman, Senator, Vice-
President, and almost President
success now would only mean being
able to do something.”
As to the “something” he might do
the approaches of the Eisenhower
era do not suggest that it will be any-
thing wild.
It has to be recalled that at that time
American Liberals were in favor of the
cold war. They believed in involving
America in “the fight for freedom”
against Communism all round the
world.
It was, after all, the Ike-Nixon
regime that got America out of the
cold war. It was the same pair who
wanted to get on chatty terms with
Khrushchev. In spite of John Foster
Dulles and his “massive retaliation,”
the two at the top were for coming tec
terms. And although it was Eisenhower
who planned the Bay of Pigs assault
on Castro in Cuba, John Kennedy
actually carried it out. Similarly it was
JFK —later to be more than seconded
by LBJ —who stepped up the war in
Vietnam. The very fact that Mr. Nixon
has long ago sown his anti-Communist
wild oats has had an effect on him.
On the home front, faced by the
terrible hazards of black power and
white backlash, Mr. Nixon’s political
and family background seems likely to-
incline him toward moderation. Mr.
Nixon may not be a deep man or a
man of sound political judgment. In
the past he has played with national
prejudices. But he has not played with
national hysteria, as the late McCarthy
once did and as Wallace has done. A
weaker man might try to placate the
white-backlash forces flourishing be-
hind Wallace. Mr. Nixon might con-
ceivably find some original, even
devious, way of not placating them and
of frustrating them with moderation.
It may be that many Americans, and
especially the young ones, will feel that
this election has given them at best a
boring and unattractive leader, at worst
one of whom for complex reasons they
feel ashamed. But with things poised, as
they now are in America, on the edge
of disaster, this could be the hour for
a non-glamorous Chief Executive with
ideas embedded in the past. At times
of national crisis an immaculate King
Arthur is not necessarily the safest bet.
AFTER HUMPHREY, A PARTY IN RUINS
THE SETTING was unworthy. It
happened in a mean and overdecorated
provincial ballroom. The audience was
small and exhausted by an all-night
watch. And yet the occasion was
genuinely tragic and many people wept
openly. Hubert Humphrey was admit-
ting his defeat in Minneapolis.
In the aftermath of his defeat the
Democratic Party is in ruins.
The Party will have to be re-formed
this time wilhout the South, without
the automatic support of Labor and
without the certain support of the
Liberals, many of whom undoubtedly
angrily voted for Nixon.
What will certainly occur is a
protracted struggle between the various
wings of the Democratic Party and
it now has as many wings as a seraph.
The process of choosing a candidate
probably will be changed. The old
method of meeting in convention, once
the way of testing the popular will, has
become both inefficient and undemo-
cratic. It is hardly more than the
coronation of a man who has already
been chosen elsewhere. But the real
struggle will be, in the words of the
“Wall Street Journal,” between the
“issue-orientated evangelists and the
power-minded practitioners of the old
politics.”
Almost tco obviously there is one
candidate who might please both the
old professionals and the new
reformers. This, of course, is Senator
Edward Kennedy. He is up for re-
election in Massachusetts in 1970, and
if, as seems likely, he can win an over-
whelming triumph, he will have a
formidable authority as well as a
formidable name. He has almost kept
out of this Presidential election and is
in no way touched by the defeat. He
would be able to re-create the coalition
■and to re-form the Party. He has made
no move yet and is wisely silent. A
great deal of political in-fighting lies
ahead.




MEANWHILE INVIETNAM?
By JOHN P. ROCHE
IN THE SPRING of 1966, the Presi-
dent asked me to go to Vietnam to get
the “feel” of the place, and some sense
of the possibilities for the development
of representative institutions. From that
time I lived day in, day out, week in,
week out, with the problems of Viet-
nam. And I watched, impotent and
heartsick, while the war eroded the
position of the Johnson Administration.
As an old-fashioned liberal cold
warrior, I saw and still see nothing
immoral about fighting to contain
aggressive totalitarianism. Suppressing
my human fears, I was prepared to go
to the brink with John Kennedy over
Berlin and Cuba, and last year I was
equally prepared to support the Israelis
to the hilt had the Soviets intervened
to rescue their incompetent Arab clients.
In sum, just to get the record clear at
the outset, I take for granted the vital
role that the United States must play
in helping to achieve a stable world,
and I believe that South and South-
East Asia present a major challenge to
stability in our generation. I may be
wrong I have never been able to
attain the witless certainty of the true
believer, and have lost a lot of sleep as
a result. But, right or wrong, this is what
I believe. The unfortunate thing about
this \vorld is that one always has to
make a 100 percent action commit-
ment on the basis of inadequate
evidence. If you wait for all the pre-
cincts to report, you do not make his-
tory —you write it.
On occasion, I reacted bitterly to
criticism and was particularly hard on
the communications media. But bitter-
ness destroys the analytical capacity
and the hard fact in my judgment is
that (whatever the distortions of the
media and the critics may have been)
Vietnam poisoned our political atmos-
phere for a far more fundamental
reason than a failure of communication
between the Johnson Administration
and the people.
The basic issue in Vietnam was this:
Could a free society fight a limited war?
That is, a strategic war, a war without
hate, a war without massive popular
involvement. To put it differently, the
war in Vietnam was being fought for an
abstraction: American national interest
in a non-totalitarian Asian future. And
it was being fought by a new set of
rules, rules which began to emerge
during the Korean War, but were for-
gotten in the subsequent years. It was
very difficult to tell a young soldier,
“Go out there and fight, perhaps die, for
a good bargaining position.” It was
almost impossible to explain to Con-
gressmen that Vietnam was a crucial
testing ground on one side for a
brilliantly mounted “war of liberation”;
on the other, for American capacity to
cope with (and, in future, deter) such
liberators. What sense, moreover, could
the average American make of the
offer of future economic assistance to a
non-aggressive Hanoi? What, in short,
had happened to the concept of “the
enemy”?
As one of the early advocates of
flexible response and limited war, I
watched the defection of the liberal
intellectuals with sombre anguish. The
record is perfectly clear: limited war
was conceived of by liberals as the
liberal alternative to massive retaliation
and/or isolationism. It was the liberal
answer to John Foster Dulles that was
to find classic formulation in the
speeches of President John F. Kennedy
and in Robert McNamara’s spectacular
reorganisation of the Department of
Defence. At root, John F. Kennedy’s
theory asserted that instead of relying
on apocalyptic nuclear power to deter
aggression, the United States would be
capable of a flexible, measured response
to the forces deployed on the other side
of the hill. Kennedy and McNamara
realised that the very character of
nuclear war made any other response
an all-or-nothing proposition; one either
pushed the button or capitulated.
John Foster Dulles managed to com-
bine verbal brinkmanship with de facto
isolationism, but to many it seemed
that American power under Eisenhower
and Dulles was undergoing the death
of a thousand cuts. So we assailed
Dulles, called for an active foreign
policy, and beat the drums for flexible
response: the defence posture that did
not leave the United States with the

years as Special Consultant to President
Johnson. Now that he has returned to
his university he sums up. His sum-
mary seems good .advice to President-
elect Nixon.
two crisis options of nuclear weapons
or appeasement. Indeed, in November,
1962, the “New Republic” editorially
took an unblinking view of the pos-
sibilities of a land war in Asia —and
chose it as preferable to another
nuclear confrontation on the Cuban
model.
We assumed, naively, as it turned
out, that the knowledge that the U.S.
could transport 100,000 men 12,000
miles in 47 hours and 32 minutes (or
some such logistical triumph) would
itself act as a deterrent. Discussions of
military strategy began to sound more
and more like seminars in game theory.
There was a kind of antiseptic, quality
permeating the atmosphere; one often
had the feeling he was attending a chess
match.
This, in part, was the source of many
later problems. An expert chess player
John Foster Dulies...
"managed to combine
verbal brinkmanship
with de facto isolation-
ism, but to many it

John F. Kennedy...

Lyndon B. Johnson...

can at a certain point confidently tell
his opponent “mate in 12 moves.”
No rmally the opponent, if he is worth
playing with, concedes and starts a
new game. The atmosphere made those
of us who come from the harsh train-
ing of poker decidedly uneasy. We
knew that nobody has ever folded a
full-house because he suspected another
player of holding four of a kind. Educa-
tion in these matters always costs
money. In international relations it
costs more than money—human lives
are involved.
Vietnam has provided an agonising
education on the limitations of our
theory of limited war. The worst of it is
that what I believe to be the real
“‘lessons of Vietnam” were largely
ignored on the political circuit ill the
Presidential campaign. The hustings
were full of politicians solemnly
intoning “No More Vietnams.” But try
to find out what this meant. The late
Senator Robert Kennedy was relatively
clear. In his lexicon it merely meant
“don’t support losers.” (If one changed
a few words in Kennedy’s major
address on the subject and travelled
back 30 years in time, his speech be-
comes a devastating case against anti-
Franco intervention in the Spanish Civil
War. Franco did, after all, become the
very model of a polycentric fascist, a
nationalist “Tito” in Hitler’s New
Order.) Assuming the winner is identi-
fiable from the outset, this advice can
be helpful.
But what was one to make of Senator
Eugene McCarthy’s gloss on “No More
Vietnams”? It was a bit murky, but the
gist of his admonition seemed to be that
we should only help good nations. Even
weak ones, for he specifically mentioned
India.
Now, ever since I took seriously
President Kennedy’s statement that we
are “the watchmen on the walls of
world freedom” only to learn later
from reading Arthur Schlesinger’s
“Bitter Heritage” that Kennedy did not
really mean it I have been reading
the small print rather carefully. So
when I came upon McCarthy’s 'nomina-
tion of India as a possible substitute
for Vietnam, I was, to say the least,
startled. The small country of South
Vietnam has swallowed up half a
million American troops. Can one con-
ceive the magnitude of the troop com-
mitment that would be necessary to
bolster India’s feeble defences? Or
of the bill for the military hardware
that would come due if the Indian
Army were to be equipped properly?
Since I take McCarthy’s intelligence
for granted, his statement could only
make sense if (1.) he had an ironclad
promise from Peking that India will not
again be invaded; or (2) he was silently
and surreptitiously returning to the
Dulles strategy of nuclear containment.
If the latter is the case, McCarthy’s
“No More Vietnams” formula involved
the abandonment of limited war and a
rejuvenation of the nuclear strike. Thus,
militant “liberals” were in the odd posi-
tion of embracing the H-bomb as the
instrument of American policy. The
Republican position was quite simple.
Richard Nixon, of course, submitted
that the Democrats get the country into
wars they cannot end citing Korea.
This was shorthand for the proposition
that the Republicans know how to deal
with Communists, that. President
Eisenhower ended the Korean War by
threatening to use nuclear weapons on
the sanctuary, that limited war is a
“no win” policy and a gross misuse of
our incredible national power.
I believe today as I believed in
1956 that this nuclear strategy would
in the long run be disastrous for the
United States. But it has the enormous
political advantage of being abstract. In
October, 1962, we lived through the
most perilous week in the history of
mankind, but there was no blood on
the TV screens. The “dirty little war”
m Vietnam, on the other hand, is
infinitely and, with TV, intimately
bloody. While one can argue that fewer
Americans have died there in the past
six years than die annually in the
United States from drunken driving,
that one MIRV would destroy more
people than have been killed in all of
Vietnam in 20 years, he can expect
no sympathetic response. Vietnam is
war nuclear holocaust is a remote
fantasy.
Paradoxically, the marginal character
of the war in Vietnam contributed to
its political liabilities. It was not a big
war; it was not, comparatively speaking,
costing much - 3-4 percent of the
Gross National Product compared with
roughly 11 percent for Korea but it
had no built-in support in the electorate.
President Johnson could have drummed
up support by hitting the traditional
chord of messianic anti-Communism, by
engaging in old-style McCarthyism.
There were some in Washington, in
fact, who advised him three years ago
that he could not fight an invisible war,
that unless he provided the American
people with a vivid “enemy,” he would
face massive defections.
But Lyndon Johnson flatly refused to
whoop up yahoo chauvinism. At least
half a dozen times I heard him say that
he remembered the anti-German
hysteria of World War I and the con-
sequences of Joe McCarthy in the
’fifties; that he was not going to be the
president “who got Americans hating.”
The historical irony of this is that by pro-
hibiting a return to the old reactionary
McCarthyism, he generated the new
liberal McCarthyism, which has loosed
more hate in the United States than
“old Joe” could ever have dreamed of.
The rhetoric of limited war is in itself
a major problem. Johnson was carved
up by his critics for telling the troops
at Camranh Bay to “bring home that
coonskin.” Perhaps the figure of speech
could have been improved upon, but
what American commander-in-chief
could address his troops in the field and
urge them to die, if necessary, for a
stalemate? The British in the 19 th
century could play strategic chess with
their regulars and mercenaries—invad-
ing such unlikely places as Tibet,
Ethiopia, Zululand, and Afghanistan—
with no repercussions at home unless
(as in the First Afghan War) they lost.
Once they achieved their usually
limited objectives, a treaty was forth-
coming and the troops pulled out.
Individual families would mourn a
sergeant killed in the Sixth River War,
or a sepoy butchered at Kabul, but ex-
cept for disasters these wars were fought
outside the forum of British public
opinion.
If Ho Chi Minh had permitted the
war in Vietnam to remain invisible—
with only professional soldiers involved
—the pattern of the 19th century might
have been retained. But Ho Chi Minh
was always a problem. While we may
have been fighting a limited war against
him, he had declared total war against
us —and he played his hand brilliantly.
His central goal (learned from his
experience with the French and from
the lessons of Algeria) was to escalate
the war in Vietnam to the point where
it became politically unjustifiable in the
United States. Put differently, he would
not permit Johnson to fight an invisible
war and—knowing the major tenets
of the doctrine of limited war T — he
proceeded in 1965-68 to utilise his assets
to the maximum. To be specific, the
United States had foresworn any direct
attacks upon the ' legitimacy of the
Hanoi Government, had barred the use
of nuclear weapons, had in short-
recognised Ho’s political sanctuary.
True, we denied him military sanc-
tuary by bombing the North, but he
obviously wrote off bombing as a pain-
ful harassment and countered at our
weakest point: ground control in the
South. Over the DMZ, and in from
Laos and Cambodia, came the regulars
of the North Vietnamese Army to but-
tress the guerillas already on the
ground. The infiltration began well


before the decision to bomb the North
and—-with a great deal of coming and
going across unmarked frontiers--prob-
ably exposed over 200,000 North Viet-
namese troops to combat in the South.
This commitment of PAVN (Hanoi’s
regulars) was a death-blow to the con-
cept of the invisible war. Air-power
enthusiasts to the contrary, there is only
one way to fight infantry—with other
infantry. Air power provides mobile
artillery, but nobody ever pacified a
province with an F-4. In 1965 and 1966
—for reasons we will explore subse-
quently—there was suddenly an acute
shortage of riflemen in the Republic of
Vietnam.
So far, we have been cutting across
time and history with a certain amount
of recklessness in the interests of explor-
ing the various consequences of our
commitments to limited war in Indo-
China. Let us now proceed in a more
orderly historical fashion. What we
tend to forget is that, in the years of
the Kennedy' Administration, Vietnam
was not centre-stage the real crises
were in Berlin, Cuba, and, of all places,
Laos. The Soviet willingness to make
a Laotian deal, which appeared to be
completely ignored by Hanoi, suggested
that perhaps the big Powers could
bilaterally close down Indo-China as a
source of instability by simply getting
the children out of the game.
The difficulty was that the Soviets
either could not, or did not choose to,
go through with their end of the bar-
gain. (In my judgment, their efforts
were simply spiked by Hanoi’s intransi-
gence; Khrushchev overestimated his
influence on the Viet Minh hardliners
and was probably later incensed by their
effrontery in disregarding the Geneva
Agreement of 1962.) Thus, instead of
Laos returning to its status as a kingdom
with a thousand years on LSD, the
Pathet Lao guerillas, aided as in South
Vietnam by PAVN regulars, took over
the task of protecting the Zone of Com-
munication: the Ho Chi Minh trail.
The significance of this double-cross
cannot be underestimated. What the
Laos agreement of 1962 represented was
a willingness by the United States and
the Soviets to respect a genuine neutrali-
sation of the country, to achieve a
■“political solution.” This had been a
liberal demand in the United States for
years. I, for example, had supported it
vigorously at various conventions of
Americans for Democratic Action, and
liberal spokesmen had been unsparing
in their attacks on Kennedy, and
Eisenhower before him, for supporting
a Right-wing military junta in Laos.
Now the authentic, 24-carat “neutralist”
Souvanna Phouma was brought back
to Vientiane and given our blessing to
opt his nation out of the Asian cold
war. Had he been successful, we hoped
to follow the same pattern in all Indo-
China.
The Laotian agreement was a horse
dead at the post, however, a complete
nonstarter. And all the evidence that I
have seen indicates that President
General Westmore-
land..."We
assumed, naively as
it turned out, that
the knowledge
that the U.S. could
transport 100,000
men 12,000 miles in
47 hours and 32
minutes (or some
such logistical
triumph) would
itself act as a
deterrent"
Robert Kennedy...
"The hustings were
full of politicians
solemnly inton-
ing 'No more Viet-
nams.' "But try to
find out what
this meant. The late
Senator Robert
Kennedy was rela-
tively clear. In
his lexicon it merely
meant "don't sup-
port losers"
Kennedy, who had a cold eye, realised
this and realised that Laos was, with
the possible exception of Bhutan, the
worst place in the world to try to
match Communist military pressure. So,
writing Laos off as tactically hopeless,
Kennedy turned his attention to Viet-
nam, where the situation was very dif-
ferent, particularly in terms of accessi-
bility. His reply to Hanoi’s repudiation
of the Laotian settlement was to
reinforce the defences of the Republic
of Vietnam.
There have been a number of
accounts by associates of the late Presi-
dent Kennedy to the effect that he
wanted out of Vietnam, too. Regret-
tably, these lack empirical foundation
and quoting the dead is an ancient
form of historical fraud, immune to
either proof or disproof. The funda-
mental evidence notably his support
of Secretary of State Dean Rusk and
McNamara suggests that he was
unhappy about the situation in Vietnam
(as who, with any knowledge of the
place, was not?) but felt the line had to
be drawn and enforced in that nation.
On this basis Kennedy made the
quantum jump: disregarding the Geneva
Accord of 1954 (which we had unoffici-
ally respected but never signed), he
increased the number of American
“advisers” from roughly 750 (as
authorised at Geneva) to over 16,000.
In addition, “Green Berets” were boot-
legged into Vietnam under covert
auspices.
This is no place to investigate the
internal affairs of the Saigon Govern-
ment. Suffice it to say that the Diem
regime, after a seemingly amazing start
in the 19505, was in deep trouble in
1962-63. Objectively viewed, Diem was
in an impossible enfilade: the Ameri-
cans would not let him run an efficient
dictatorship (like the one in Hanoi),
and he was incapable of building effec-
tive representative government. Con-
fronted by the chaos in Saigon, which
became much worse after the fall of the
Diem Government in November, 1963,
the Americans gradually made—with-
out really recognising its import a
critical decision: to fight the war in-
dependently.
The basic premise, which I do not
believe I have ever seen clearly arti-
culated, was that the United States with
its massive technological assets would
directly force the Hanoi leaders to pull
back their troops. We would, in other
words, “punish” the Democratic Re-
public of Vietnam (DRV). Once Ho
and his chief strategist, General Giap,
knew what they were up against they
would agree “mate in 12 moves” and
give up the game. This shortcut had
two admirable arguments in its favor:
First, we could effectively ignore the
condition of the Saigon Government;
second, we could employ our air-power
assets with a relatively slight loss of
American lives. The unfortunate con-
sequence was that the South Viet-
namese Armed Forces (ARVN) were
treated as orphans and given essentially
a spectator role in the U.S.-Hanoi com-
petition.
Unfortunately, too, Ho and Giap were
never programmed by the Pentagon’s-
game-theorists. They were determined
to prevent the United States from fight-
ing a cut-rate war. Down the Ho Chi
Minh trail came the trained regiments
of the PAVN with the mission, not of
defeating the United States on the
ground but of forcing the Americans
to fight a ground war in full, costly
visibility. To a considerable extent these
soldiers were on a suicide mission, but
when one appreciates that their goals
were political rather than military the
“kill-ratio” loses much of its impact.
North Vietnamese Premier Pham Van
Dong had announced the scenario as
far back as 1962 when he told the late
Bernard Fall: “Americans do not like
long inconclusive wars—and this is go-
ing to be a long inconclusive war.”
President Kennedy presided over the
transformation of American strategic
theory from massive retaliation to flex-
ible response, but at the time of his
murder (less than a month after Diem
fell) the United States had only put
this doctrine into action in the Cuban
missile crisis. Lyndon Johnson, then,
inherited from Kennedy a strategy, a
Cabinet, and a seemingly trivial con-
flict in Vietnam. As he went on to elec-
tion in his own right in 1964, Vietnam
was still on the back pages —but there
was great stirring in Hanoi, and PAVN


Senator Eugene
McCarthy..."But
what was one to
make of Senator
McCarthy's gloss on
'No more Viet-
nams'? It was a bit
murky, but the gist
of his admonition
seemed to be that
we should only help
good nations.
Even weak ones, for
he specifically men-
tioned India"
engineers and support troops were busy
building base camps in the Central
Highlands of South Vietnam. Indeed,
communications with the Viet Cong
were being developed to the point
where, in the remarkably short period
of six months, the guerillas were re-
armed with the 7.62 weapons family,
most notably the AK-47 automatic rifle.
(Not only was the AK-47 incomparably
superior to the Garands and M-ls of
ARVN, but no American rifle before
the M-16 could match it. In fact,
I have seen Marines up in I Corps who
carry the AK-47 in preference to the
M-16.)
There is no need to recapitulate in
detail the events of the next few years.
President Johnson, who was only alerted
to the full gravity of the Vietnamese
crisis in the autumn and winter of 1964-
65, has been savagely assaulted for
deserting the Kennedy doctrine for a
'“military solution.” Nothing could be
further from the truth: Johnson com-
mitted American air power and then,
in the summer of 1965, ground forces
to frustrate a “military solution,” a
Hanoi victory. (Lincoln did not want
a “military solution” to the Secession
Crisis of 1861, but despite his wishes
half a million Americans died. Like Ho
and Giap, Jefferson Davis and Robert
E. Lee were most unco-operative.)
In 1964-65, the Americans began
looking for trained Vietnamese soldiers
to meet Ho Chi Minh’s challenge on
the ground in the South; they found a
poorly trained, miserably equipped, dis-
pirited ARVN. Despite our experience
in Korea, where in 1950-51 American
divisions had scouts out on their flanks
to make sure the ROKS were still there
—although five years later South Korea
had probably the finest army in Asia—
ARVN had remained a stepchild. So
American soldiers and Marines, in-
stead of providing a steel frame for
the training of ARVN, had to take the
field themselves. There simply was no
time for the necessary training (the
lead time in Korea had been a good
year and a half). The “Americanisa-
tion” of the ground war was thus a
consequence of military necessity.
Yet military necessity, while an ex-
planation for what has occurred over
the past three year’s, is not an excuse.
Why did Presidents Kennedy and John-
son and Secretary McNamara con-
sistently neglect ARVN? One can
suggest a number of partial answers:
The American officers in the field
obviously felt that nothing short of
a drastic purge of the officer corps
would do any good—and such a purge
was politically impossible in Saigon;
the Pentagon’s budget experts, faced
with the need to cut, would patently
give higher priority to the needs of an
American service than to ARVN; and
Congress in 1962-63—the key years —
would-clearly have taken a dim view of
a massive and expensive rearmament
and training program. Vietnam was a
kind of low-level infection which they
hoped would go away. (And had the
President endorsed such a program, the
organised liberal community in the
United States—with me in the forefront
in my capacity as National Chairman
of Americans for Democratic Action
—would have denounced him to the
rafters for supporting the “reactionary,
unrepresentative Diem clique.”)
But these' are partial answers. I
think the real key to ARVN’s neglect
was the Pentagon game-theorists’ belief
in their own Press releases; they be-
lieved that pressure on Hanoi, “turn-
ing the screw,” would lead Ho to make
the logical calculation that he had more
to lose than gain by continuing the con-
flict. Unfortunately, this was based on
a complete misreading of the mind
and character of a dedicated and ruth-
less Leninist—one who, in Koestler’s
phrase, is prepared to sacrifice one
generation in the interest of its suc-
cessor.
What Ho Chi Minh did, to return
to the main theme, was to hit the
doctrine of limited war at its weakest
point: domestic opinion. The Johnson
Administration, hit by ground war on
a scale never anticipated and by the
accompanying casualty lists, tried to
maintain the ground-rules of limited
war. What this often amounted to was
simply “hunkering up like a mule in
a hailstorm” as the apocalyptics of the
Left- and Right-wing spokesmen for
national frustration raged throughout
the land. The crux of the matter is
that while any two-bob demagogue can
make the eagle scream in a nice, neat
“us or them” confrontation, explaining
the rationale of limited war is incredibly
difficult.
Adding to the burden was the disaffec-
tion of the young, notably the college
elite who compensated for their defer-
ment with the noxious psychic
compound of safety and guilt it
provided by a torrent of abuse of the
President and the Administration
worthy of a 16th-century lunatic sec-
tarian. Though this, in aggregate, prob-
ably influenced relatively few young
people who are as leery of religious
extremism as the rest of us the cold
fact is that American youth has a
genuine grievance. Never in our history
has a war been fought with so little
involvement by the society as a whole.
Which is another way of saying that
Vietnam really has been an adult’s
war and a young man’s fight.
Who was hurt? The economy roared
along, the Dow-Jones crept up, unem-
ployment was down, incomes were at
a record high, corporate profits were
pushing the roof. The answer is that
nobody except the young men directly
at war and indirectly their families
were hurt. In existential terms, the
young were left alone with the war.
When I was in Danang last year, a
Marine major put it to me. “Oddly
enough, in the light of all the agitation,’ 1 ’
he said, “I have never seen Marines
with such good political morale. Net
even in World War 11, and certainly
not in Korea. Can’t the Administration
get the people to take this war seri-
ously? Couldn’t Johnson at least ration
tyres so they would know there is a
war on?”
These are the things we never thought
of when, with all the zeal of innocence,
we liberals advanced our doctrine of
limited war. Now, in 1968, those who
stayed the course, who had the courage
of their consequences, stand appalled
by the revival of .isolationism and
its identical twin, nuclear deterrence.
They stand appalled, too, by the fact
that a great President, Lyndon Johnson,
has gone into political limbo because
of his indomitable commitments to a
sound but unpopular policy, flexible
response, and limited war.
Johnson can look with confidence to
the judgment of future historians, but
the immediate problem remains. If the
“lesson of Vietnam” is that a free,
democratic society cannot fight a limited
war; what strategic options are still
open? Must we revert to the balance
of terror? Or, as some notable liberals
today seem to think, can we build afflu-
ence in one country and somehow
escape the broils of the outside world?
I confess that, battered as I am, I
still believe that flexible response is not
only a sound but a liberal alternative
to the only other strategies I see on the
horizon. And I would suggest that those
who are busy leaping up and down
about Vietnam take a brief pause in
their exercise to inform us precisely how
they plan to employ American power
in the interest of international stability
and world order.
Except for the pacifists (and those
who are pro-Hanoi), I have yet to find
a critic who when pushed back on
his premises did not end up embrac-
ing some variety of isolationism. There
is nothing wicked or un-American,
about being an isolationist, but it is a
doctrine that American liberals outgrew
a quarter of a century ago. It would
be tragic if a united front of Nixonites
and followers of Eugene McCarthy,
playing up to the understandable frus-
trations of the American people, have
undermined our commitment to limited
war and returned us to the age of
Dulles. Perhaps we should recall that
while limited war is nasty, for most of
us, resurrection would be a precondition
for appreciating the strategic virtue of
nuclear retaliation.


THE WEEK IN AMERICA
GALLUP GOT UP
THE POLLSTERS, politicians, and
the Press were all claiming they came
close in their pre-election forecasts of
the Presidential race. All had foreseen
basically the same pattern — at the out-
set Richard Nixon took a huge lead
that dwindled, at first gradually and
then swiftly, but remained just large
enough to put him in the White Plouse.
The Gallup Poll, oldest and most
prestigious American public-opinion
testers, came closest of all. It predicted
accurately that Nixon would garner
43 percent of the popular vote. It also
predicted that Humphrey would get
one percent fewer votes than Nixon,
but their margin was closer than that,
a mere fraction of one percent. Gallup
predicted George Wallace would get 15
percent, but he actually polled 13'per-
cent.
The result of the 1968 election was
scarcely known when speculation started
concerning the identity of the man
who would oppose President Nixon in
1972. The name of Senator Edward
Kennedy, of Massachusetts, brother of
the slain John and Robert Kennedy,
led all the rest. Students at the
University of Pennsylvania donned
green lapel buttons reading, “EMK—
1972.” Many of them had worked for
Senator Robert Kennedy and Senator
Eugene McCarthy in the recent cam-
paign. Other students wore black arm-
bands of mourning, denoting sorrow
over Nixon’s election.
POSTWAR DIVIDENDS
NEXT JANUARY President Nixon
will have to present to the new Con-
gress a Budget (for the 1970 fiscal year
beginning on July 1, 1969) which is
now being drawn up by his pre-
decessor’s Democratic administrators.
As long as the war goes on in Vietnam,
there will be very little leeway for the
President. But it is widely assumed,
perhaps overoptimistically, that the
United States will begin withdrawing
from Vietnam in 1969. For these
reasons the estimates prepared for Vice-
President Humphrey’s campaign by his
Task Force on the post-Vietnam Budget
which had access to Administration’s
planning are of special interest.
The report of the Task Force,
revealed recently, was that the cake
will not be ‘ large next year, even if
troops began to come home during the
summer. Quite apart from the defence
demands that cannot be denied, there
are other increases in spending built
into existing programs. Thus the
“peace” dividend in the 1970 fiscal year
will be $4 billion at most, according to
the Task Force, even though the war
has been costing $20 billion a year.
But after 1969, for the rest of the
new President’s term, as long as an
adecpiately expansive fiscal and
monetary policy is pursued, there will
be a “growth” dividend of about $l5
billion a year to add to the “peace”
dividend provided, of course, that
the President pursues a peaceful policy
in other parts of the world. By the
1973 fiscal year there should be over
$69 billion extra on the receipt side
of the Budget; this comes from the
increased revenue brought in by taxes
at existing levels when the national
product is growing at the Task Force’s
projected full - employment rate of
4J percent a year in real terms.
Increases in social security and welfare
programs, in bureaucrats’ pay and in
grants to State and local governments
will take about half of this, but the
Task Force calculates that there should
still be some $2O billion available.
J. B. Priestley...thoughts on rough
women
THE MAN'S COUNTRY
J. B. PRIESTLEY, venerable British
author, in New York last week to
launch a new book, said he did not
share the opinion prevalent in England
and elsewhere that America is a
matriarchy.
“AIR of America is dominated by
the masculine principle,” he insisted
in a Press interview. “It makes women
aggressive, since they’re in the wrong
world. I think the women are rougher
than the men here — and indeed
women generally. Found that in the
bombing, you know. I was all through
the blitz. The men were enraged and
wanted to hit back. The women took
it.
“Women have to take a lot of things,
and they have a lot of endurance. They
live longer than we do. Whether
that’s a good thing I don’t know. New
York is full of rich widows walking
grimly down the street.”
Priestley found in New York “great
eagerness for new experience” but was
not convinced this was a good thing,
either. “I think many of the new
experiences are not worth having. I
think most of the underground groups
and tiny theatres are rubbish.”
SCORPION'S DEATH
THE REMAINS of the U.S. Navy’s
nuclear submarine Scorpion have been
located 10,000ft. down in mid-Atlantic,
but the answer to its mysterious end
may be a long time coming. The
Scorpion, a hunter-killer craft designed
to attack enemy submarines, became
overdue at Norfolk, Virginia, on May
27 last on an undersea voyage from the
Mediterranean with a crew of 99
officers and men. The Navy carried out
one of the most extensive searches in
its history, involving at its peak 55
ships and 23 aircraft. The research
vessel Mizar, dragging undersea
cameras, located the Scorpion about
400 miles south-west of the Azores
Islands.
Experts viewing the Mizar’s films
virtually ruled out the possibility that
the Scorpion had struck an underwater
mountain, as had been theorised. Other
possibilities were: structural or mech-
anical trouble, such as a broken seam
or small hole in the hull; collision with
a ship or another submarine — Soviet
ships and submarines are operating in
the disaster area—or explosion of the
nuclear reactor, considered most
unlikely, since it would have been
detected by instruments aboard search
vessels.
The Navy did not expect total
recovery of the Scorpion. Most search
work will be done by camera and
attempts will be made to salvage only
those parts of the submarine yielding
clues to the disaster.
UN —16 AND GROWING
THE UNITED NATIONS looks like
being in New York to stay. A dramatic
expansion of the 18-acre UN enclave
on the East River in mid-Manhattan,
its first major alteration since the inter-
national body settled there in 1952, will
get under way early next year. A three-
acre strip of parkland to include
tennis courts, a hockey field, and a
jogging and cycling path will be con-
structed on pilings along the river-
front. The United Nations private
school, which serves 1500 children, will
be moved to a new building.
The project, in the planning stage for
two years, will cost about $50 million.
Secretary-General U Thant said he
hoped a substantial part of the cost
would be paid by private sources. Pre-
sumably these included the Ford
Foundation and the Rockefeller
Brothers’ Fund, both of which have
already made major contributions to
UN facilities, including the planning
phase of the expansion.
Although pressure for additional
office space and housing sparked the
expansion move, the addition of a park
answers the need of recreational facili-
ties for the delegates and staff. Park
plans also include space for bocci
courts to continue a long neighbor-
hood tradition. Bocci is an Italian out-
door bowling game particularly favored
by retired men.

Asia’s hopes of Nixon —and fears
AS MR. NIXON finally went over the
top to become President-elect there
were a lot of sighs of relief—not least
in Kuala Lumpur from anxious punters
who had laid many heavy bets upon
his success. The relief as far as could
be seen was general in Asia. Pre-
election surveys had Nixon winning in
most Asian cities barring Indian ones.
But in the immediate aftermath the
relief was mixed with caution, the satis-
faction with uncertainty. Even as it was ,
generally recognised that there was not
much difference between the two can-
didates, so it was seen—at least by the
more perceptive—that the dictates of
American national interest and dom-
estic politics might not necessarily re-
bound to Asian advantage.
Of all the welcoming statements that
of the Malaysian Prime Minister,
Tunku Abdul Rahman, was probably
the longest and it also well-mirrored
the anxiety as well as the hopes, the
doubts as well as the earlier assumptions
that the Nixon Presidency would follow
well upon the Johnsonian one.
“It is my prayer that Mr. Nixon will
be able to continue to do as his pre-
decessors have done to give help to
those nations who are in need of
help,” said the Tunku, reflecting the
feeling that Nixon might not be able
to do so, foreign aid being firmly in the
doghouse at the moment. “There is
very little basic difference in policy be-
tween the two candidates vis-a-vis the
policy of peaceful co-existence with the
world which wants peace and at the
same time the determination to con-
tinue the fight for peace” but
would the demands be all for the one
but not for the other?
Almost as if he feared that the
American electorate and mood might
pressurise Nixon in the same direction
as Mr. Wilson, the Tunku termed
Nixon’s comeback “great personal
triumph . . .” showing that “Mr. Nixon
has a will of iron and an indomitable
spirit to achieve whatever goal he has
set his mind upon. Such a man can do
wonders . . .” “America has all the
strength and resources to help every
freedom-loving nation and above all
maintain her position as the champion
of democracy,” hopefully opined the
Tunku, expecting that the new Presi-
dent could bring “light and happiness
to the underprivileged in the United
States itself and to the other parts of
the world.”
Other South-East Asian reactions
were in similar vein. Nixon is well
known in the area and his reputation
is that of a hardliner who will not
renege on American commitments. But
the doubts created by the timing and
style of the bombing halt, the Europe-
Middle East stress in Nixon’s post-
election pronouncements, the very
atmosphere of uncertainty over Western
alliances first created by the British
withdrawal, accentuated considerably
by prolonged Australian indecisiveness,
and further aroused by the tenor of the
U.S. election campaign—these have all
taken their toll. The week ended there-
fore with the Thais stressing the urgent
need for a Foreign Ministers’ meeting
outside the limited scope of just
SEATO, the Asian and Pacific Council,
or the Association of South-East Asian
Nations. Mr. Nixon has stressed the
need for more collective Asian security
arrangements, but ironically the doubts
created by his election look likely to
provoke moves in this direction.
Whether they would come to any-
thing remains very jnuch in doubt,
and in any case another Nixon con-
cept was straightaway knocked on the
head. Mr. Sato, as he campaigned for
his third term as Party President and
Prime Minister, rejected any notion
that Japan would become a sparking
plug for regional collective defence,
stressing that her strength was
inadequate and that she was in any
case barred from doing so by her no-
war constitution. Implicit, of course,
was the recognition that were he to
run on and change the constitution
policy he would most definitely end up
defeated, like Mr. Humphrey. Japanese
papers belatedly termed Nixon’s
thoughts on rearming Japan as most
likely to increase anti-Americanism if
carried into pressure.
Mr. Nixon immediately increased
anti-Americanism in the Philippines by
not saying anything at all. Evidently
he failed to mention the Filipinos when
talking of America’s other allies.
Predictably this put the old cat among
the pigeons, with Nixon being either
accused of taking the Filipinos for
granted or forgetting them.
“It would have been much better if
he had mentioned the Philippines one
way or another,” said the Acting
Speaker of the Philippines House of
Representatives, hastily ' scheduling
studies of Nixonian statements. All of
which left the intriguing possibility
that Nixon had left out the Filipinos
on purpose. Said the Philippines
“Herald”: “Closer ties can be expected
since Mr. Nixon is well posted on this
part of the world.”
Probably it is hoping too .much to
expect that because he is well posted
Nixon realises that closer ties with the
Philippines are not only impossible
but undesirable.
V One Asian government had perhaps
more riding on Nixon than any
other South Vietnam. Obviously
Saigon had boycotted the renewed Paris
peace talks in the hope of helping
toward a Nixon victory and who
knows? maybe they,, were success-
ful in that. Certainly the pre-election
disclosure that Johnson knew in
advance that South Vietnam would not
attend probably did Humphrey no
good. But whether a prolonged stalling
of the Paris negotiations will be in
Saigon’s interest remains in doubt.
Mr. Nixon is the subject of several
Asian miscalculations, the most sig-
nificant of which would appear to be
Saigon’s and others’ failure to see that
the President-elect, unlike Mr. Humph-
rey, has the inestimable advantage that
he doesn’t have to prove he is “soft on
Communism” which might well re-
sult in his taking (as several U.S.
commentators have pointed out) more
risks in the fight for peace, not less.

RUSSIA AND THE U.S.
SLOW, COOL LOOK
By DEV MURARKA
RUSSIA HAS responded quietly to the
emergence of Mr. Richard Nixon as the
next President of the United States.
Only discreet little comments have
appeared in the Soviet Press and they
are not very different from what the
U.S. Sixth
Fleet planes
flying over
two Russian
guided-
missile
destroyers in
the Mediter-
ranean off
Turkey
last week. —

American columnists are writing
that Nixon got in on the strength of
the protest vote against President John-
son’s policies.
Soviet reaction may be subdued be-
cause the Russians are busy celebrating
the 51st anniversary of their revolution.
It is, however, not the only reason.
Soon after Mr. Nixon emerged as a
serious candidate for the Presidency, the
Russians indicated their revaluation of
the man. Cautiously, they emphasised
that the new Nixon was somewhat dif-
ferent from the younger, wilder, and
trickier one. Especially in the foreign
policy field.
Soviet reserve in commenting upon
his success is a precaution against
antagonising him unnecessarily. But
they have no illusion that a difficult
period lies ahead in Soviet-American
relations. The difficulties won’t be any
easier with Nixon as President. But,
as the man they will have to deal with
in the White House, they want to
weigh him before coming to any
definite conclusions.
Undoubtedly the Vietnam peace
negotiations in Paris and Nixon’s atti-
tude to them will be the touchstone for
immediate judgment upon him. But
the Russians have also a strong feeling
that Mr. Johnson must still be reckoned
with on Vietnam.
In other important areas of policy,
where there is sometimes a conflict, and
on occasions an identity of interest
between the two super powers, the
Russians are anxious to encourage the
moderate side of Mr. Nixon and estab-
lish a working relationship with his
Administration as soon as practical.
Hints of this trend appeared even be-
fore the election, when preparations
were made for a visit by Mr. Nixon.
The Czechoslovak crisis, however, froze
the thaw between Nixon and Moscow.
The. Russians can only hope that it
will be a temporary freeze.
They are relying on the Americans
to take a more realistic attitude in
Europe and not to encourage demands
for making NATO more militant. On
a number of issues Washington and
Moscow are bound to pursue conflict-
ing policies which might bring to a
standstill their detente on other issues,
most notably in the field of dis-
armament.
For instance, it appears that, on the
Middle East, Mr. Nixon is committed
to support Israel. The Russians have
already sounded a warning note to
Israel against renewed aggressiveness on
the assumption that Washington is be-
hind Tel Aviv. They have also thrown
out a hint that, if fighting breaks out
again between the Arabs and Israel, the
Soviet Union may have to play a more
active role.
Another potential source of trouble
will be the East European countries.
Soviet objections to American contacts
with them have become stronger than
ever. The Americans are regularly
accused of fishing in troubled waters
in association with West Germany. This
resentment will continue to sound a
jarring note in their relationship.
Moscow has reacted to Mr. Nixon’s
election with equanimity, but this will
last only so long as he does not embark
on a policy which directly threatens
Soviet interests. Once this happens the
Soviet reaction is likely to be strong,
since Russian distrust of Nixon as a
Cold War warrior is strll strong just
below the surface.
NEW ZEALAND
TUG OF INTERESTS
By ANTHONY HAAS
MR. NIXON’S call for a militarily
oriented Asian and Pacific Council is
opposed by New Zealand because of
Japan’s objection. This became clear
at the August ASPAC Council meeting
in Canberra, and Japan reiterated her
stand immediately after Nixon’s elec-
tion. Nixon’s reputation as a hardliner
on defence could put New Zealand in a
position where her relations with the
U.S. and Japan could be contradictory.
Opinion groups in Japan could swing
further against a renewal of the U.S.-
Japan Mutual Security Treaty, and in
this mood New Zealand will be further
disinclined to pressure Japan since she
is sensitive to her developing trade
relations.
Yet if New Zealand trade and
defence policies were synchronised and
if her worst fears about, growing pro-
tectionism in Nixon’s America were
realised, she could face real pressure to
succumb to Washington’s wiles.
Meat and Dairy Board chairmen
both commented that Nixon’s policies
could be protectionist and harmful to
New Zealand, 16 percent of whose
trade worth $126 million is with the
u.s.
Prime Minister Holyoake said in
Washington recently, “If we are to
share a wide international role we need
the confidence and assurance that comes
from a sound and developing economy.
New Zealand was everywhere con-
fronted by a disinclination to extend
the comparative principle to inter-
national trading in agricultural
products.”
New Zealand is conscious that Nixon
told the cattlemen who helped elect
him that he was prone to their require-
ments. In fact, these fears may be
groundless if a Democrat Congress
prevents Nixon from increasing the
quota barriers and he shows himself
true to the approach in the Eisenhower-
Nixon period when liberalised trade was
endorsed.

Waiting for Thieu to come round
SOMEBODY has been playing politics
vvith the Paris peace talks, but who?
The closing stages of the American
Presidential campaign saw an accel-
eration of the pace of diplomatic events
on the Vietnam front. But Mr. Johnson
has been visibly devoting himself day
and night to this effort; and the talks
in fact stayed in the doldrums too long
for his personal timetable. To be
able to announce before election day
the basis for a new phase of the nego-
tiations, and to get these going
immediately the elections were over,
was about the least he had to aim at to
keep alive his chance of achieving any-
thing much in his term of office"
The North Vietnamese could have
done more, earlier, to bring about the
bombing halt and the new nego-
tiating phase. But they, too, waited till
the American elections were imminent:
perhaps to heighten Mr. Johnson’s
anxiety, but still get a procedural basis
agreed before his successor was chosen,
anticipating, maybe, that the latter
might be a still harder man to deal
with. Some officials in Washington
think that the same thought may have
influenced President Thieu in Saigon to


put a spoke in Mr. Johnson’s wheel at
the last moment.
The overwhelming probability, how-
ever, is that, for any effect it may have
on the American attitude to Ho Chi
Minh, or Thieu, the American Presi-
dential election might never have
happened. The next President will
support Mr. Johnson in his remaining
efforts, and will persevere with them
after him if, as seems likely, Mr. John-
son has to leave them uncompleted.
America wants an end to the war, and
the next Administration will start its
life in full consciousness of this amply
demonstrated fact. But it can be no
more willing than its predecessor to
dump the Saigon Government and
withdraw to leave room for a Com-
munist takeover.
While there was disappointment and
so,me anger in Washington at Saigon’s
refusal to come to the table in Paris,
there was also quite a degree of toler-
ance and understanding. The North
Vietnamese made a concession of sub-
stance by reducing their military
activity in the south, and a conces-
sion of form by agreeing to have a
delegation from Saigon at the table
at all: these met President Johnson’s
conditions, and enabled him to order
the bombing halt. But the National
Liberation Front were to be at the
table, too, enjoying just as much recog-
nition from the Americans as the
Saigon delegates would fro ; m the North
Vietnamese that is, none at all.
Thus a kind of equality would be
established between the two; a hard
thing for a government to accept. It
was not unexpected that Saigon should
seek an assurance that the delegates
from Hanoi would talk to its delegates
directly when the new phase opened in
Paris, and would not treat them as
usurpers who had to address them-
selves to their own rebels.
President Thieu asked the American
ambassador in Saigon, Mr. Ells-
worth Bunker, for such an assurance
on October 30 and 31, but Mr. Bunker
would not give it to him. President
Thieu had been told by Mr. Bunker
in mid-October what the American
proposal for representation at the new
Paris talks was going to be: neither side
would raise questions about the com-
position of the opposing delegation, so
that all four parties could, in fact, be
present without questions of
recognition being raised. In the Wash-
ington version, President Thieu, for
himself personally, concurred. A delay
of 11 or 12 days followed while the
Hanoi Government made up its mind,
and then a few days of hedging and
sparring about forms and details, before
President Johnson announced his bomb-
ing halt on October 31. He must have
known when he went on television that
President Thieu was not happy with
the arrangements. But he hoped that
President Thieu would not drag his
complaints out into the and that
if he did, he would sooner or later
come around. This is what Mr. John-
son still hopes.
SOUTH VIETNAM
"FEEDING US BALONEY"
IN THE South Vietnamese versions,
things look very different. The gist of
the affair is that Ambassador Bunker
had secured South Vietnamese agree-
ment to a conference involving repre-
sentatives of the United States, Saigon,
and Hanoi. It was generally under-
stood that the NLF would form an
integral part of the Hanoi delegation.
Meantime, in Paris, Ambassador Har-
riman had already made a deal with
Hanoi that the NLF could appear as an
independent delegation. When Presi-
dent Thieu heard from his representa-
tives in Paris, pandemonium broke out.
In the end the South Vietnamese
washed their hands of the whole Ameri-
can shenanigans. The debate here is
whether so.mewhere between the White
House, Bunker, and Harriman that
American communications broke down
or whether the Americans simply
intended to double-cross Saigon.
Senior Vietnamese Government
officials accused Mr. Johnson of play-
ing politics with peace, and Mr. Bunker
of attempting to bundle them off to
Paris regardless of the .means he
employed or the consequences for
South Vietnam.
Mr. Bunker’s first questionable ploy
was used on the very first day, October
16, when he met President Thieu at
6.45 in the morning. In the words of
one pro-American diplomat, “he simply
handed Thieu the typewritten joint
com.munique on the bombing halt
Washington wanted to send out and
expected him to sign on the dotted line
in a matter of hours. The Americans
had been secretly negotiating with
Hanoi for days on a peace package
that vitally affected South Vietnam
and the South Vietnamese Govern-
ment itself was the last to know.” Mr.
Thieu’s answer was that he would have
to consult the rest of the Government.
Variations of these tactics also
occurred during the three weeks of
confrontations. There was the soft-sell
approach, in which American Embassy
officials invited numerous influential
Vietnamese to dinners and lunches and
“fed us full of baloney that we were
strong enough to negotiate at this time,”
one Vietnamese diner recalled.
But the real American chicanery
began later. The Americans were
accused of gross misrepresentation at
best, at worst of low-level lying to the
Vietnamese Government on the status
of the NLF at the expanded peace talks.
The whole affair went off the rails
when Mr. Thieu found out the vast
discrepancies between what Mr. Harri-
man was telling South Vietnamese dele-
gates in Paris—that there would be a
four-power conference with the NLF
separately represented—and what Mr.
Bunker was saying in Saigon—that
Paris was to be a tripartite affair.
This stage began on October 25
when the Vietnamese presented the
Americans with two new drafts of the
joint communique to end the bombing.
With reluctance, Mr. Bunker accepted
the milder version. Both drafts, how-
ever, spoke of “direct and serious talks”
between Saigon and Hanoi. In no shape
or fashion, said Saigon, could the NLF
figure as a separate delegation, though
it could join Hanoi’s representatives.
On October 27, Hanoi gave its final
approval to Mr. Harriman’s peace
package. On October 29, President
Thieu asked his Vice-President to pre-
pare to head the new Saigon delegation
to Paris, because he believed the bomb-
ing halt was imminent. Bunker told
Thieu that everything was fixed.
Vice-President Ky .specifically asked
if Washington OK’d Saigon’s draft
communique, mentioning the three-way
conference. Bunker said yes. Ky asked
if Hanoi approved. Bunker said yes.
Ky said fine. Bunker said the bombing
halt would be the next day and the
expanded peace talks would begin on
November 2. The Vietnamese objected
that “we can’t get a delegation there
in four days. We agreed to go to Paris,
but not on November 2.” The Ameri-
cans blew their tops.
Then, according to one Vietnamese
who kept a brief diary of the whole
affair, “while we were haggling with
Bunker about whether we’d go on
November 2, an aide came in with a
cable from our Ambassador Pham
Dang Lam in Paris. Harriman had told
Lam, ‘Hanoi did not accept your pro-
posal and we did not even ask Hanoi
to accept it. Your Government does not
represent all of South Vietnam, Mr.
Ambassador, and you would do well ta
remember that.’ The faces of Thieu
and the Vietnamese crumbled. Bunker
was asked to go to the next room.
Thieu said obviously someone was lying.
Then we showed Bunker and Berger
the cable. Bunker said maybe Lam mis-
understood Harriman. We said no one
could misunderstand to that extent. In
funereal silence, Bunker and Berger
went back to the American Embassy.
One and a half hours later they came
back. Bunker handed Thieu a letter
dictated over the phone by President
Johnson. Johnson said it was all a
misunderstanding. Bunker is my repre-
sentative in Saigon. My policy is what
Bunker says.”
The Vietnamese then said they would
still send a delegation to Paris to talk
to the Communists directly—but only
as a preliminary, to arrange the ground'
rules for the real talks. The final tense
confrontation occurred on October 31,
the Vietnamese knowing the halt was
imminent. The Vietnamese presented
another draft text for the joint com-
munique similar to their earlier one,
but mentioning “preliminary” talks. At
4 a.m., five hours before President
Johnson announced the bombing halt,
Bunker and Berger left with the draft.
They returned two hours later with a
counter-draft which had dropped the
word “preliminary.” Three hours later,
Mr. Johnson announced the ending of
the bombing. Next day President Thieu
dropped his own bombshell about not
going to Paris. Mr. Thieu happily
awaits the accession of President Nixon.

The
vision
at
Gove
BY DENIS O'BRIEN
VICARIOUS adventures for the desk-
bound escapist: Mt. Isa, Kalgoorlie,
Lightning Ridge. The mind toys with
the images and then discards them. The
reality of familiarity has dulled the
fantasy.
All right, then . . . what about Rum
Jungle or Mary Kathleen? Well,
maybe once upon a time, but now
there’s something too nostalgic about
uranium to excite the hungry imagina-
tion.
Hunger, is it? Then feed on Hamers-
ley’s iron at Mt. Tom Price or Western
Mining’s nickel at Kambalda. Yes,
yes; they’re the stuff for the gargantuan
appetite, but man can’t live by moun-
tains of ore alone. And, anyway, there
is something too predeterminedly
unsubtle about such mammoth develop-
ments out there in the harshness of
Western Australia to satisfy the psyche.
Then it has to be Gove. Ah, yes
Gove town centre as the planners set
it. Principal features include (1) a shop-
ping mall; (2) the town swimming-
pool, backed by the community club;
(3) a motor hotel; and (4) a primary
school
Gove. There is the place where the
imagination can take flight.
Gove is perched on the tip of the
western side of the Gulf of Carpentaria;
it clings to the edge of the vast Arn-
hem Land Aboriginal reserve, where the
legends of dreamtime are being con-
fronted by the multi-million-dollar hard
facts of Australia’s northernmost
development the Nabalco Pty. Ltd.
bauxite-alumina project.
Literally and figuratively, Gove is
a frontier development: remote, staring
across at Asia, hewn out of virgin land,
and one of the first new national
developments due to come into produc-
tion in the 19705.
Nabalco, a Swiss-Australian consor-
tium, has budgeted more than $3OO
million to bring Gove into production,
but it is not the size of the investment
that quickens the pulse. These days,
any sum of more than five digits is
just a doodle in the mind. What
attracts the visionary eye to Gove is the
way in which it is being shaped as a
centre for Caucasian settlement.
Up there on the roof of Australia,
where the pervasive sense of tranquil
timelessness puts a refreshing perspec-
tive on life, a planned town for 4000
people is about to grow. On a small,
rocky rise lapped by the Arafura Sea,
the Nabalco people have erected a semi-
circle of display boards showing the
planners’ vision . . . houses, schools,
shops, roads, public buildings, even a
motel. To the south is the site a
gentle, undisturbed flat, scattered with
tropical growth, lying between low Mt.
Saunders and a sandy beach. Under
the influence of the environment it is
not impossible to visualise the modern,
self-contained community that architects
have outlined, and almost possible to
feel the human heartbeat of the place
four years before it will all be a
reality.
Not all of Australia’s giant new de-
velopments touch the sensitivities; some
of them are too suddenly vast to be
more than awesome, others too harsh
to be seen as more than a stock-
exchange statistic. Across in Western
Australia, the vigorous urgency of the
action at KamDalda, Mt. Tom Price,
and Dampier is inclined to overwhelm
humanity. Houses, supermarkets, and
community clubs have been built to
satisfy basic needs, but one cannot help
feeling that they are there as rather
hurried afterthoughts to the primary
objective of mechanically gouging out
ore.
There is still an air of the old
frontier about the development towns
in the West a feeling of only vague
permanency, a carelessness about iden-
tity, and a scratching haste to live 25
hours a day.
Even at Weipa, Gove’s older bauxite
sister 250 miles across the Gulf, there
is little sense of the human spirit rising
to contribute more than the necessary
effort to get the bauxite out of the
ground and ship it away.
Weipa is a surprisingly pleasant settle-
ment among the comparative wilderness
of Cape York Peninsula country, and
to be fair to the place it has not been
planned to match the size of Gove. Its
bauxite is shipped south to Gladstone
for chemical conversion into alumina
(Gove is to have its own treatment
plant), so the sustaining population and
facilities do not need to be as large,
The prefabricated houses are neat, if
unimaginative, the lawns are green and
close-clipped, and the general impres-
sion is of a cloistered, new middle-class
suburb. But Weipa does not give out
an attractive ethos,
Perhaps it is absurdly idealistic
if not anachronistically romantic
to try to evaluate profit-motive national
developments in terms of aestheticism
and psychology, yet the vision for
Gove translates into those terms,
Some weeks after a brief visit to
Gove I can still see it as a sort of
tropical demi-paradise, fed by heavy
industry and watered by tourism,
Looking at a map, it might be
difficult to reconcile its remoteness
with the ambitious concept, but one
has only to stand among Gove-on-the
drawing-boards at Nabalco’s head-

the vision is not ephemeral.
Before World War II Gove did not
exist even as an awkward monosyllabic
name. It was simply a part of Arnhem
Land known to the Aborigines as
Nhulunbuy, a name given to the area
by Wuyal, their dreamtime ancestor.
Matthew Flinders is recorded as
having made a geological observation of
the area in 1802 during his circum-
navigation in the “Investigator,” but
white settlement did not have per-
manent beginnings until 1934, when
the Methodist Church established a
mission at Yirrkala on the eastern side
of what is now the Gove Peninsula.
When the war began, the area
assumed strategic importance. The
RAAF established a base there, and
the sealed airstrip which they
unknowingly built across 12,000,000
tons of bauxite still serves Gove as
an airport. When the Air Force quit the
area, it left behind large dumps of
rusting fuel drums, a few derelict air-
craft, and the name “Gove” to
commemorate a Pilot Officer W. H.
Gove, who was killed there in circum-
stances which seem to be buried in
some Department of Air filing cabinet.
It was not until the early 19505, when
Australia began to stir to an aware-
ness of its vast and varied mineral
deposits, that Gove was put under
intensive geological survey. The survey
proved major deposits of bauxite ore
beneath a thin layer of overburden.
There was then a stop-start tempo in
the development at Gove. Leases were
granted to the British Aluminium Co.
Ltd. in 1958, and to the Gove Bauxite
Corporation in 1963, but all were sur-
rendered without major development
work being carried out.
The Nabalco consortium was formed
in 1965. For the next two years it
undertook a $1 million-plus feasibility
study, which explored ore deposits (at
least 200 million tons), soil conditions,
tides, weather, transport potentialities,
costs, profits, and the social concerns.
The study was published in a set of
seven thick volumes, and even as in-
dustrial literature it must be one of the
most comprehensive surveys ever com-
piled on any part of the Northern
Territory.
Nabalco won the right to develop
Gove against at least three competitors.
The Federal Government ratified the
agreement in May; deadline for the first
bauxite to pour into the alumina plant
is January 1, 1972. Gove is being
wrenched out of its dreamtime.
The plot for Gove is being con-
trolled from three floors of the 24-
storey Goldfields House on Sydney’s-
Circular Quay, where Nabalco has its
headquarters. Architects, engineers, and
draughtsmen so far have turned out
20,000 drawings of the town, crushing
station, alumina plant, and marine
terminal; scale models of houses and
plant installations are ranked on tables
and benches like a confused toyland-
On a notice board between rows of
drawing boards, a bit of lighthearted
cynicism helps to keep the vision out
of cloudland: someone has mocked up
a display advertisement for Gove in the
weekend style of metropolitan land"
developers low deposits, intermin-
able terms, instant everything, and Syd-
ney Harbor bridge looming on a nearby
horizon.
Almost 2000 miles away in the north-
west, the site for the new Gove is
marked out with a casual sense of
humor which strangely reduces the
initial disbelief that a town as big as
Millicent in South Australia and bigger
than Maroochydore in Queensland will
grow there within four years. On the
dirt road in to the work camp from
the airstrip the sign that points away
in the bush to “Nurses’ Quarters” and
another which directs the visitor to a
non-existent “Fire Station” somehow
gives the project a determined
credibility.

is parted by a row of three houses
standing in beautifully cultivated
gardens that recall one of the few taste-
ful corners of Surfers Paradise. Roman

daughters. Zufferey is the on-site chief
mechanic and he has lived at Gove
for almost two years, helping to super-
vise the feasibility studies and now
contributing some of the momentum
that is slowly changing the Gove land-
scape.
It is the thought of Gove-to-be as a
social entity more than its industrial-
isation that fascinates me. The scraping,
bulldozing, and grabbing for ore is an
ordered ritual; the conversion of bauxite
into alumina is a scientific process that
intrigues only until such time as the
mind recoils from its complexities or
registers it as an interesting accom-
plishment; but the gathering of a com-
munity into a town-planned settlement
beyond the rim of Australian civilisation
is no ordinary objective.
The map of Australia is scattered with
towns and cities that have grown from
single-purpose origins. They are still
erupting. Kambalda is growing on
nickel and Karumba on prawns. In
their representative way they are towns
that tempt a man to stretch his muscles
and deprive himself of some of' the fat-
cat creature comforts of the 20th cen-
tury for the purpose of making a bit
more money than most.
Gove has as much money motivation
as the rest of them, yet it seems to
offer a plus appeal for the simple
idealist. No one believes that the town
will open for occupancy completely
guttered and kerbed, and with all its
facilities in place; nor even with all
its trees left in such strategically decora-
tive positions as the planners have them.
The nine-hole golf course probably will
be low on the priority list; inevitably
there will be flaws in the air-condi-
tioning.
Accepting the chasm between ideal
and actuality, Gove still rises as an
unusual social project. As a project, its
conscientiously landscaped concern for
its future settlers interests me more
than a consideration of its alumina
being devoured by some European fac-
tory. I am impressed by the fact that
the bauxite will be carried from the
crushing plant by a continuous 12-mile
conveyer belt to the alumina plant, but
I am more impressed by the planners’
attempt to create disuniform residential
neighborhoods up there in the never-
never. I am taken by the man-made
port facilities to come which will
accommodate convoys of large
freighters, but I am more attracted to
the thought of children learning to
swim in the town swimming-pool beside
a sea in which few but Aborigines are
game to plunge fearlessly.
Gove has been planned with the
consultative help of social scientists and
the co-operation of most of the com-
panies whose industrial projects have
helped to change maps of Australia in
the past decade. The aim is to make it
a place to live more than just some-
where to exist while making money.
On the way from plan through com-
promise to reality something of the
charm of the project might disappear,
but at this distance it brims with appeal.
The town will be built about six
miles east of the alumina plant. On the
drawing board it rises in almost angular
sterility, yet the very scope of the
concept, the careful precision with
which it has been planned, and its
futuristic symbolism among such
untouched remoteness somehow softens
the angles and gives the whole project
an exciting warmth.
Initially, the alumina plant will have
an output of 500,000 tons a year, and
the town has been planned to accom-
modate a population needed to sustain
that capacity. Extensions will follow as
the plant is expanded for a 1,000,000-
ton output. Building will begin next
year. The town centre will include a
community shopping mall, a hotel-
motel, a social club with swimming-
pool, a community hall and library,
town administration offices, and a
primary school. The residential area
will rise north and south of the town
centre and will be a blend of low-set
Gove in isolation
family homes and double-storey
bachelor units. A 50-bed hospital will
be built on the southern slope of Mt.
Saunders. The town will be fully air-
conditioned, although trade winds keep
the area naturally cool in all but the
wet season.
The town plan appears to be the
result of a combination of Swiss taste
and Australian practicality. Nabalco
executives are eager to stress that Gove
will not be a “company town.” They
see the company element being
balanced by a 30 or as much as 40
percent involvement by Government
and small private enterprise. Areas are
set aside for light industries independent
of the alumina plant and studies are
well advanced into the possibilities of
establishing a wood-chip industry.
Executives talk, too, about the tourist
potentialities of the place, conveniently
leaving to marine science the problem of
Arafura Sea sharks and sea wasps, and
quite keenly motivated by the influence
of picture-postcard beaches and the
gentle wildness of the country. The wit

Swiss Aluminium Ltd. has a 50 per-

50 percent is divided among eight Aus-
tralian companies. The Colonial Sugar
Refining Co. Ltd. holds percent;
the Australian Mutual Provident

since the recent disclosure that the

But problems of Australian identity
at Gove are not merely financial. More
than 600 Arnhem Land Aborigines live
permanently in the Gove area. It is
their land. Throughout the preliminary
planning, Nabalco has maintained close
relations with Aboriginal leaders, kept
them informed of developments,
received their encouragement for the
project, and guaranteed to preserve all
the Aboriginal sacred sites in the area.
And on an alumina output requiring
2.5 million tons of bauxite a year, the
company is committed to a minimum
royalty payment of $250,000, which
would go into a trust fund for the
benefit of Aborigines in the Territory.
But under the mounting pressure of the
development, some company officials
have begun to display flashes of irrita-
tion with what they obviously regard as
rather petty demands by the
Aborigines.
When I was being driven back to the
airstrip during my visit we passed one
of the many banyan trees which have
been marked as sacred by the Abori-
gines. The ground around the tree
had been levelled up to the roots, and
a young Aborigine from the mission
gently told me that his mates were not
very happy about such token preserva-
tion. A company man in the truck cut
in irritatedly, “But before we came your
blokes used to run around burning
down all the trees.” The company is
slightly annoyed, too, by the recent
Aboriginal petition to Federal Parlia-
ment which asked that Gove be
renamed Nhulunbuy. Prime Minister
Gorton supported the change and that
didn’t exactly please Nabalco, either.
“I can’t even pronounce this other
name, and my secretary has difficulty
spelling it,” said one executive.
“Heaven knows how any one overseas
will get their tongue around it.”
At present, though, Gove remains
beguilingly monosyllabic. Having seen
it in embryo and briefly shared a sense
of its future, I can’t help feeling that a
four-letter word is inadequate for one
of Australia’s potentially most exciting
developments of the ’seventies.

On the gentle art of port sipping
There’s a revolution happening in
Europe particularly England
right now. The traditional picture of
a port drinker as a cantankerous old
gouty club dweller is going . . . going
. . . gone. Because the young world
has discovered port. And, what’s
more, the sophisticated young men
and women of Britain have made
Port their favourite drink. It’s not
hard to understand why. And I
believe this will happen here, too,
particularly when there are so many
very good ports available at quite
reasonable prices (our Royal Reserve
Port costs about 80c sometimes
less and is an excellent port.) Why
should you sip a port ? my answer
is that any wine that takes as long to
make as a good port, deserves to be
approached with respect. And sipped
gently and enjoyed to the last sip.
Especially with a dry biscuit before
going to bed.
On the styles of white
table wines.
Notwithstanding the number of dif-
ferent wine brands available, in
Australia we have a wide range of
white table wine types from which to
choose. I would like to quickly enu-
merate them, and briefly describe
the differences so you will have a
better idea of what the names mean
next time you buy a white wine. (Be-
cause I know them best, I have based
these descriptions on the Dalwood
range, but what I say can be broadly
applied to white wines generally).
Dalwood Riesling is light and re-
freshing with a grapey, crisp finish.
Hock is similar, but with h more pro-
nounced bouquet and flavour.
Chablis has a tangy, flinty, character,
while White Burgundy is soft and full
bodied. Other white table wines are
Moselle (like Eden Valley Moselle)
which is light and delicate with a
trace of natural grape sugars, and
Sauterne which is sweeter. If you
like Riesling, you should really try
Minchinbury Rhine Riesling. This is
different to ordinary rieslings,
as it is made from the Rhine
Riesling grape which gives
this wine a pronounced
fruity flavour that places it
in a class of its own.

Japanese travel agents visiting Dubbo
We’re such warm,
friendly people
By FRANK ROBERTS
THE RISE of Australia as an inter-
national tourist country seems one of
the certainties of the century. Fewer
than 60,000 visitors in 1959 grew to
250,000 by 1967, and should reach
600,000 by 1975 on Australian Tourist
Commission estimates. The interna-
tional currency brought to Australia by
these visitors already tops $lOO million
a year and could mean at least $250
million annually within the next seven
years.
These are fairly hazy projections.
The numbers of overseas tourists com-
ing here might grow far beyond the
expected additional 50,000 each year.
There could be more, who might spend
less. No one really knows. There is a
growing fashion among international
airways tourists to take in as many coun-
tries as possible, staying a shorter time
in each. When the “jumbo” jets begin
regular flights, around 1971, their
tourist loads could be 380 each time.
How many will be well heeled and
how many economy-minded is still a
matter of guesswork. The fares have
not been set yet. And on most there-
and-back routes likely to be flown over
the Pacific Australia will be the last
country of call, while on Pacific circle
routes it will be somewhere in the
middle. Then Australia’s appeal or
lack of it to North American or Asian
tourists will be one deciding factor in
assigning length of stay here, but
another and possibly overriding one
could be the tour-planners’ goodwill.
Planning for the great tourism era
is obviously a very complicated affair,
the more so because it really began up
to ten years ago when affluence, con-
fidence, the search for new trade
markets, and speed of aircraft com-
bined to set people of many nations fly-
ing about the world in quickly mount-
ing numbers. Nearly everyone was
taken by surprise, and even today no
country has really mastered every
aspect of the confusion. It has all
happened so suddenly, as things do
nowadays, that response to it has been
according to pressures felt rather than
in planning to meet pressures to come.
America was caught napping as
much as anyone and only a very few
years ago awoke to the weight of
international tourist money it was miss-
ing through its hard attitudes to
traveller-entry, which it quickly revised.
The signs had been evident in boom-
ing national travel, but few countries
read them in relation to the “global-
village” their nationals had discovered.
Immigration had blurred the figures,
and how many short-stay entrants were
businessmen and how many tourists?
America at least had the wealth and
skill to run surveys to find out. Tourists
were outnumbering business visitors
from other countries, and the tourism
business needed information from which
it could plan to cater for them. How
many hotel rooms and when? What
did they come to see, and how did
they like what they saw? What could
be improved? How would the costs
work out? Tourism was a great new
national business, more diverse, much
more complex than any other (includ-
ing collecting taxation or running the
mails), and it needed Government-
business co-operation.
Australia’s failure to separate busi-
nessmen from tourists (both still taken
into statistical account as short-term
visitors, which means “here for up to
12 months”) kept the figures blurred for
too long. But in the ’sixties, when the
trickle of international tourists began
to turn into a torrent though still
a muddied one as far as it may have
been used as a basis for future projec-
tion —of international short-term
visitors, both Government and the
tourist industry began to feel the weight
of traffic and, eventually, to respond to
it.
About 18 months ago the Australian
Tourist Commission was created to
handle the job of attracting inter-
national tourists to Australia, while the
Australian National Travel Association,
relieved of that concern, would look
after the tourists in Australia through
the service industries it represented.
Scenic and allied matters were to be left
to the States, with perhaps Federal
advice and help. One of the Common-
wealth Government’s backbench mav-
ericks, Senator Reg Wright, became
Minister-in-Charge.
Bypassing the Senator for the moment
(despite an impression that this is a
difficult and risky thing to attempt),
the Tourist Commission’s first 18
months deserves a quick review. Prob-
ably conscious of the leeway it has to
make up, and certainly conscious of the
imminence of “jumbo” flights and the
fact that Australia could be wiped off
the map for “jumbo” travel if those 380
seats can’t be filled, the Commission’s

activities have been running faster than
commissions usually run.
Like a busy conjurer, the Commis-
sion has been doing one act with one
hand (appointing top-level personnel,
filling its overseas appointments, bring-
ing other nations’ travel agents and
writers to Australia to see what it
offers) and another act with the other
—holding conferences and “presenta-
tions” in Australian cities to explain its
aims and procedures to the local travel
industry, and show them the way ahead,
as far as that is possible.
If that does not seem very far to me,
if the trail seems much overhung and
misty in its tomorrows, this may be a
defect of my vision, or it may be a
defect of the politicians who slipped the
Commission into troubled waters with-
out a mainsheet: with a budget approxi-
mating, as I understand it, two percent
of each last year’s international tourist
spending in Australia; anyway, for the
moment, $1.4 million. That means the
Commission, with few reliable figures
to guide it, with everything to learn
and little time to learn it in, is expected
to do what it has to do, in the blind.
This is my view, not the Commis-
sion’s. I arrived at it when attending
one of the ATC “presentations” in
Sydney last month; mainly, I gathered
for local travel agents. There were two
addresses, the first by Mr. Stanton Read,
research director of the San Francisco-
based Pacific Area Travel Association.
He reported, for one hour, on a Pacific
Visitors Survey carried out at heaven
knows what expense by an American
organisation, Travel Research Interna-
tional, whose “overall purpose” was “a
primary research study among avail-
able population groups to develop
current attitudinal information useful
in promoting Pacific travel.”
The upshot of this was that “tourist
development in Australia should follow
its present course and that advertising
and promotion should emphasise ‘warm,
friendly people,’ ‘good climate,’ ‘reason-
able prices,’ ‘comfortable accommo-
dations,’ and ‘beautiful natural
scenery.’ ” But before Australians take
a bow it should be noted that “in
order to make the findings more mean-
ingful, the research team used basic
attitudes toward European travel by
U.S. residents — such as ‘warm, friendly
people’—as a benchmark.” Unfortun-
ately, the 370 people questioned had to
reply either “warm, friendly” or “rude
and unfriendly” in this survey. So,
although 71 percent went our way, there
were no qualifying degrees, and we were
only 37 percent above the median for
26 Pacific destinations. In the “friendly”
context, as in the climate, accommoda-
tions (incidentally, the beds may have
been fine, but they didn’t care much for
our food), and natural-scenery ques-
tions, qualitative judgments are of use,
especially if they have cross-reference
to competitors, otherwise such surveys
are sheer mystique.
But sometimes mystique is preferred
if it gives the answers one wants to
hear or sets things in action. One man

in the audience suggested later that
fairly extensive questionnaires be
handed to American tourists on arrival,
but when someone else in the audience
said they would be thrown in the near-
est waste basket the matter was
dropped. Considering that today’s
American tourists coming this way are
mostly elderly, higher-educated, well-
heeled Westerners, the idea seemed a
good one, likely to produce some
reliable information at little cost.
Another man suggested that Aus-
tralia would buy much goodwill cheaply
by giving each international tourist his
or her first night’s accommodation
free, as was done in Holland. Mr.
Read promised to put the idea to the
next meeting of PATA. Everyone
seemed to accept this as normal, but
I’m afraid the idea of other members
of PATA cheering such a move struck
me as unlikely. There were not many
other questions, although the panel for
question-time was enlarged to seven,
and surely it was a time for many
questions. Perhaps no one wanted to
prolong this session into the cocktail
hour.
Senator Wright closed the “presen-
tation” with a few well-chosen words,
the last of which, after a spirited denial
that as much was being done for tourism
as the Government could manage, was
an explosive “Huh!”
I’d hope the Senator meant it.
Although the Government is spending
money willingly on other constructive
areas of tourist Australia, and is
apparently willing to spend more to
help the States boost their attractions,
much of this is primarily for the bene-
fit of Australians touring within Aus-
tralia. So far, international tourists
cling fairly closely to the cities and
their environs; relatively few see the
Barrier Reef or Ayers Rock, however
much this goes against the general
image of what overseas tourists do in
Australia. The ANTA would very much
like them to visit those places, and is
trying to develop a “circle” route for
them in Australia, say, from the south
to the Reef to the Northern Territory
and back through Adelaide, but very
few of this year’s estimated 316,000
will have gone that way.
Last year’s 220,000 visitors (without
cruise passengers) are said to have
stayed an average of 44 days each. New
Zealand sent us most, 75,000. From
North America, 42,000 and 35,000
R and R men from Vietnam. The
cruise passengers numbered 30,000.
Asia sent us 28,000 and the U.K. 26,000.
From Europe, about 15,000. The Asians
and North Americans both increased
by more than 25 percent over the
previous year. Tourists from Europe
were up by about 15 percent, Britain’s
flow by 8 percent, and New Zealand’s
only 2 percent. And generally the
industry has no way of knowing why
these shifts are occurring, what the
components are, or what they mean.
Future projections are impossible.
Even in averaging out the length of
stay, the Commission does not seem to

have extracted the essentially short-stay
R and R men to reach a truer average.
Nor has it scouted them to discover,
while the chance exists, what these
younger North Americans feel about
Australia knowing that the “jumbo”
flights are supposed to add many
younger people to the international
travel set. From such as this, or from
more usual kinds of surveys applied,
say, annually, to samples of arriving and
departing tourists at some control in
Australia, the Commission or ANTA, or
both,- might hope to discover some
material for future planning.
Research at this level is bound to be
costly, but could be regarded as pay-
ment of a past debt, enabling both
Commisison and industry to catch up on
the knowledge lag, then build a store
of information for computers to work
on. The stakes are very high. Tourism
appears to have the potential to become
a Sillion-dollar industry within the next
decade if we merely stay lucky, and
much more if we use available skills to
conduct it as a vast well-run business.
And not only a business, not only a
revenue-maker. “Trade used to follow
the flag, now it follows the tourist,”
said ATC chairman John D. Bates re-
cently, voicing something which is
probably well realised in Parliament.
But it is as important to realise the
converse. If tourism’s growth rate does
not build up as expected, an enlarged
world interest in Australia, with all that
can flow from it, would take longer
to be achieved. The stakes may be that
high.
While I doubt the value of the PAT.A
report as a basis for Australia’s cam-
paigning abroad, even in respect to
North Americans, any survey is better
than none and there was value in this
one’s examination as to whether the
tourists were group-travelling or coming
in ones and twos. That they were not
coming in congregations pointed to an
exploitable area, and the Commission
has recently advertised for a man to
develop it.
Obviously, the really big factor in
handling international tourists, parti-
cularly now, on the edge of vast
growth, is not merely to attract first-
time visitors but to have them leave so
enthused about Australia that they will
come again in some later year, and that
meanwhile they will speak glowingly
of this country. The value of word-of-
mouth advertising also showed up in
the PATA report.
I don’t see “warm, friendly people,”
etc., as having much value in product
differentiation. “Warm and friendly”
compared with which of our com-
petitors, who are all Europe, all South
America, all Asia? It is a meaningless
attribute, and so many other meaning-
ful ones exist, not forgetting those which
only spring into existence in other
people’s minds after you have stated
them convincingly. As, for example, the
film “Tropics to the Snow” set out to
do, plugging -the marvellously varied
climate available in Australia at almost
any time of the year.


Not dressing like
the boss
By SANDRA HALL
IN THE UNITED STATES an
Atlanta banker likes to appear in his
office in check sports coat and tie
inscribed with the legend, “it’s a wide,
wonderful world.” But in that not-so-
wide world, the Australian business
com.munity, there is not much sign of
the bell-bottomed trousers and Nehru
jackets which are beginning to be seen
around American and British offices.
Admittedly, those bastions of com-
merce, the banks and insurance offices,
give shorts and long socks a cautious
nod from November 1 to March 31,
but tell that to Roger Murfett, the
Sydney stockbroker’s clerk who lost his
job over a pair of shorts worn in the
cause of dress reform a few weeks ago,
or to South Australian Attorney-General
Millhouse or Opposition Leader
Dunstan, who have found that the
Speaker of the South Australian House
of Representatives doesn’t see knee-to-
knec with them in dress reform.
But the issue is a little more complex
than whether a particular organisation
decides to let its staff wear shorts,
beards, long hair, or any of the other
familiar symbols of non-conformity—
because the regrettable truth is that
most people want to conform. As the
personnel officer of one large Australian
insurance co,mpany put it: “We don’t
come across much off-beat stuff. There
are one or two with beards, but that’s
out of thousands. We don’t take a hard
line on that. Anyway, they know we
don’t want anything way-out, and if
they wear it, they’ll only have to go
home and get dressed properly. We’ve
OK’d shorts, but it’s mostly the young
blokes who wear them. The executives?
No . . . it’s just not done, I suppose.”
In other words, when you’re seriously
entered in the executive rat race, it’s
advisable not to waste time on the
business of looking different, because
that can sometimes prove a handicap,
or, as the vice-president of one staunchly
unchanging American insurance com-
pany in Boston expressed it: “If they
want to become the boss, they had
better dress like the boss does, which
means white shirt, dark suit, dark shoes
and socks, and conservative tie.”
But there is the scent of revolution
in the air—emanating from those
quarters where the creative and the
businesslike are forced to rub along
together in the cause of profit-making.
An American advertising man at a con-
vention in Sydney a few weeks ago
provoked a big laugh when he described
the creative department of a New York
agency as resembling “a hijpie colony.
We put on wigs with loag hair when
we go there so we won’t feel out of
place.
“It was interesting,” he added with a
slight edge to his voice, “to watch
management and clients listening to a
22-year-old with hair down to his
shoulders. But these people,” and the
edge sharpened, “can be made to be
interested in advertising, now that they
no longer think being asked to write a
radio commercial is an assignment to
Siberia.”
In the large advertising agencies in
Australia unconventional working
clothes are starting to become the new
conformism of “creative people.” Once
worn only in newspaper, magazine, and
television and advertising art depart-
ments, they’re moving out and up,
so that the creative departments of
agencies are looking a little like Double
Bay or South Yarra on a Saturday
morning, with denim jackets, jeans,
riding-boots, and colored shirts com-
bining into a kind of prestige uniform
signifying “talent.” One girl who works
as an artist at a big Sydney agency, says
of it, “I got a shock when I first came
here. It was almost like a spoof on
advertising ... a put on.”
Girls dress with the same flamboyance
as the men, whose compliments on the
girls’ new outfits carry almost as many
points for good design as sex appeal.
Part of the reason for this new toler-
ance for unconventional dress is. prob-
ably youth. The agencies are employing
younger people from art colleges, the
young people are able to demand more,
and one of the things they want is the
right to wear clothes they like. There
are still subtle conventions to be ob-
served, of course.
Account executives haven’t joined the
revolution. They may look better-
dressed than most other businessmen,
but for them white shirts are the rule
rather than the exception. Successful
public-relations men also share this
well-pressed air, seen most obviously
when journalists make the transition to
public relations. Overnight they sharpen
their creases and double their cuffs.
In most business houses that mysteri-
ous but all-powerful body, the public,
decides the question of what is “accept-
able business dress.” There may be
allowances for the idiosyncrasies of the
talented, but usually every effort is
made to tuck any sartorial oddity well
away from the apparently hypercritical
gaze of customers. In Farmer’s and
David Jones’ in Sydney female shop
assistants are still required to wear
black, as if nobody had ever heard the
word “boutique” or seen the girls
who work in them dressed, perhaps,
in silk micro-shifts or floating crepe
trousers and floppy-brimmed hats
trimmed with daisies.
Insurance companies put their girls
into uniform (“they feel more involved
that way,” according to one personnel
officer), although they are not to be
worn to and from work (the same
personnel officer couldn’t think of a
reason for this, unless it could be that
it saved wear-and-tear on uniforms for
which the company was paying), and.
the Commonwealth Bank in Sydney
gives its female clerks a choice—accept
a clothing allowance or use the money
to buy the bank’s version of a uniform:
navy skirt and white blouse.
It’s a testimony to the serge tyranny
of schooldays that the bank can’t
remember one girl who has taken the
money.
Uniforms.may be necessary, or at
least practical in some jobs, but they
also seem to have provoked some .mem-
orable bureaucratic absurdities. There
was the furore last year about the
Sydney bus conductress who dared to
wear a skirt 4|in. above the knee. When
reprimanded for this, she explained she
had received only two skirts in the
year she had worked for the Transport
Department. One, passed on by her
sisier, had needed alteration, so she
had shortened it to the objectionable
length; the other had split at the seams.
Transport Minister Morris kept deli-
cately clear of the matter, leaving it to
his department and the union to sort
out. Nevertheless, he did allow him-
self one noteworthy statement. The
Government, he said, would consider
sympathetically any reasonable
approach from bus conductresses,
although “it is obvious that no employer
can • allow female staff to wear out-
landish mini-skirts which offend public
decency especially in a job that
involves going up and down stairs.”
For years designers have been talk-
ing about new uniforms for nurses—
slacks have even been considered —but
the starched collars and black stockings
haven’t been abandoned yet. Last
summer, however, doctors started wear-
ing shorts in some Sydney hospitals—
without complaints from the patients.
If sick people can stand the shock
of confronting a man dressed in a pair
of shorts, perhaps some future day will
dawn when healthy investors will be
able to brace themselves against the
possibility of a similar sight during
visits to their brokers.


The angry man of the Pindan mob
By DUNCAN GRAHAM
“I’VE READ some of your stuff about
Aborigines, and I’m not pleased. You’ve
missed the whole point of the problem
and wasted your time. You’re just a
hack journalist.”
I had been warned to expect criticism
from Don McLeod, leader of the Pindan
mob, the most controversial man in the
history of W.A.’s Aborigines, but I was
not prepared for what I got. The criti-
cism, which I ignored, lasted for about
20 minutes before we crouched on old
truck tyres in the shade of an iron
shed and talked, with a background
noise of big machinery tearing up the
country for the Mt. Newman iron-ore
railway, more objectively.
McLeod, the man who started the
Aboriginal stockmen’s strike in the
Pilbara in 1947, has been jailed, has
fought pastoralists and governments
through the courts and in some cases
has won had agreed to see me at his
12-mile camp outside Port Hedland.
Jacob Oberdoo, offsider of the Pindan
mob leader
His history had been recorded in
Donald Stuart’s book “Yandy.”
Only 300 (the Native Welfare De-
partment reckons about 150) Abo-
rigines remain of the original Pindan
mob of about 600. The mob split several
years ago over a court case concerning
the handling of the group’s financial
affairs and mineral rights, and the split
was widened by liquor, for McLeod,
who has a hatred for drink, refused to
allow the Aborigines to drink.
Dressed only in a pair of khaki shorts,
but blackened to the color of a half-
caste by the sun, the toothless (he
pulled his own teeth out with a piece
of string), hairy, unkempt, bearded little
man with skin like the hide of an old
bullock gave his opinions freely. He
was surrounded by his henchmen, five
stern-looking Aborigines led by a
statuesque, handsome desert man
dressed like a priest with a snow-white
shirt buttoned to the neck. This was
Jacob Oberdoo, McLeod’s offsider.
When McLeod had finished with me,
he started a tirade against the pastor-
alists. “The rich man in his castle, the
poor man at his gate, God made them
highly or lowly and ordered their
estate,” he shouted. “That’s the system
and you can’t alter it.” He became so
agitated that he leapt, stiff-legged and
flat-footed like a corroboree dancer,
several feet up and down and round
in the heavy camp dust.
When he quietened down I asked
how old he was. “I’m 60. This business
caught my interest in 1934. Then I
spent several years reading books, re-
searching, learning about the black-
fellows. In 1942, I went to a meeting.
I’d never spoken in public before. I
was tongue-tied. Then I saw two priests
in the audience laughing at me. I was
so mad I became articulate I stood
up and spoke without faltering.”
The Pindan mob was formed later.
McLeod was elected leader, he said, by
the elders of all the North-West tribes,
representing about 9000 people. He had
remained leader, but the frustrations
had come. The Government, pastoralists,
police, missionaries, whites, blacks . . .
McLeod is not a man of compromise.
He hates with deep feeling, particularly
missionaries (“buying a place in heaven
on hire-purchase bulldogs between
me and the people”) and the pastor-
alists. Every time the name of a
prominent W.A. Cabinet Minister was
mentioned he spat almost involun-
tarily. But with the hate went admira-
tion for men as hard and fearless as
himself.
What does he feel he has achieved?
“Nothing. Not one thing. All my
schemes have been failures. I’m so
damn frustrated by these blackfellows.
I ran away recently, but the mob
brought me back . .
What does he expect to achieve?
“Nothing. The squatters will make sure
of that. They hate anyone who supports
the blackfellows.” Why does he lead
these people? “I hate to see little
people crushed —though the blackfellow
is not little. He’s a proud man. I’m a
proud man. My father led the McLeods.
But proud men get cut down like tall
poppies. They need a leader, a man
who’s literate, who can fight the
squatters and the Government on their
own ground. They need a man who
can understand the law, read mining
acts and mineral prices, fix a truck,
check a clearance, read a map, and
fight the squatters. The blackfellows
are not literate.”
McLeod is literate, well read,
educated, intelligent, articulate. He is
also eccentric by his own admission
and losing his memory since two
strokes.
Counteracting his argument that the
Aborigines should be literate McLeod
has a fetish against education and
refuses to allow the children (with one
exception) to attend school. This he
can do because under a little known
section of Western Australia’s Educa-
tion Act children living more than
three miles from a school do not have
to attend. He argues that education pro-
duces subservience and kills the Abo-
riginal culture. The boss, he said, is
always white.
What does he think will happen
when he dies? “Another stroke will
probably carry me off, tomorrow or in
40 years. Then the mob will be cut to
pieces in a year. The history of the
white man is the exploitation of the
colored races. The white man has an
inbuilt feeling of superiority over the
black man. All of us, you and I, too.
Twenty times a day I unthinkingly
insult these blackfellows with my
attitudes and the things I say. Who
lived in this country for thousands of
years without destroying one species of
bird, animal, or plant life? Who existed
in this hard and arid land without any
external help?
“Why, they were starving at Sydney
Cove in 1770, waiting for supplies in a
land where the blackfellow had survived
for generations. Who discovered the
minerals up here in Pilbara? The black-
fellow discovered them and then
the Government handed the country
over to the Americans and Japanese
to exploit.”
After the 1947 strike, the Pindan
mob took to mining and still depend
on this for a living. They have
tantalite, tin, and other mineral shows
near Marble Bar, Wittenoom, and
Roebourne. But most of their minerals
are scratched from the surface without
the aid of big equipment.
“We court destruction every day,”
said McLeod. “We’re living on the
breadline now, but it’s been like this
for years. We get $2OOO a month in
child endowment and what we make
from the shows.
“This is the blackfellows’ land. They
could bring back their Law and put
their culture and morality back into
the country. They need a leader, but
there’s no One else, so they have to do
with an old bag of bones like me. Yet,
these people have more pride, morals,
and culture in their little fingers than
you and I.
“We’d buy the stations from the
squatters in a great arc across the
North-West coastal hinterland. We’d
buy because the country would be full
of hate if the squatters had to give the
blackfellow his land. Oh, they’d hate to
see the blackfellows sitting on their
veranda instead of in a camp beyond
the creek. Ten million acres would be
enough to settle 9000 people. They
could graze it, irrigate it, mine it. The
man without land or money is nothing.”

BUSINESS
AND THE ECONOMY
One restrained
cheer for the
President-elect
... very little reason fur dancing in
the streets.. .
AMERICAN FIG PITERS for the con-
tinuance of free-trade traditions are
losing hope. The tide of protectionism
is once again riding high across the
U.S., but this time it is likely to be
carried into the White House by
President-elect Richard Nixon, together
with some ominous implications for the
rest of the world’s major trading
nations, Australia included. On Friday-
last, the Federal Treasurer took a
Canute-like stand against the whole
process, which he thought .to be
illogical, inexplicable, and in the long-
run unacceptable to Australia and of
no benefit to the United States.
Ihe efforts of the Kennedy and
Johnson administrations to pursue the
course of liberalised trade policies have
been undone as often as not in the U.S.
Congress. Up on the Hill of late, pres-
sure has been mounting on already-
sympathetic listeners to provide pro-
tection for the steel dud textile
industries.
In his electioneering campaign, Mr.
Nixon has aligned his sympathies
accordingly. Equating the surge in the
import of steel with the export of job
opportunities he has promised, if he
became President, to deal promptly
with this “dangerous trend.” He has
committed himself to restrict the import
of textiles.
Even more importantly for Australia,
in gaining the support of the farm belt
of the Mid-West, his gentler comments
on the floods of cheap beef coming into
the country must now inevitably lead
him to do something permanently to
relieve the cost-price squeeze which U.S.
cattle farmers are blaming on the im-
pact of imports. America has been so
far the outstanding customer for Aus-
tralia’s beef, taking $163 million worth
of it last year out of a total export of
$199 million.
The fate of steel exports to the U.S.
is a matter of relatively little direct
concern to Australia, although any
major restriction could provide a sub-
stantial knock for BFIP. Of far more
importance to the economy as a whole
would be the indirect effects of such
a move on the exports of iron ore
(worth $BB million last year) and coal
($B5 million) shipped to the steel mills
of Japan, which look to America as one
of their major overseas markets. The
high hopes for the future of iron ore
and coal as two of Australia’s biggest
growth potentials in the export stakes
cannot now be quite so high as they
were in the pre-Nixon days.
Japan, too, is a major exporter of
textiles to America, and an importer of
Australian wool worth $244 million last
year. Add to that the similar position
of the Common Market countries and
Britain, which took a further $244
million of Australian wool last year, and
there is very little reason for dancing
in the streets.
But are the post-election glooms quite
as unremitting as all that? Federal
Treasurer McMahon believes that with
Mr. Nixon as President the flow of
capital from the U.S. to Australia is
now assured. And that it is. Though
any easing of restrictions on the export
of capital from the U.S. is going to
await first a final solution in Vietnam,
and that could take a year or two yet.
Even if restrictions were lifted it is still
not going to be of much consequence
to Australia, which has suffered very
little decline in direct investment
because of them, anyway.
What little joy there is centres on
the offices of the stockbrokers. Is a new
and liberal era of U.S. portfolio invest-
ment in Australia about to dawn? Faint
and restrained murmurings in the
vicinity of Collins and O’Connell
Streets suggest this might be so.
WHEAT AND MEAT BOARDS
TAKING THE SPOTLIGHT
AUSTRALIAN PRIMARY produce
boards, notably the Wheat Board, have
always preferred to hide their pub-
licity lights under the proverbial bushel.
Latterly, however, both the Wheat
Board and the Meat Board, another
reluctant spotlighter, appear to have
woken up from their long publicity
slumber. Perhaps this is more apparent
than real in that these two boards are
faced by emergency situations in which
a bit of public sympathy would help.
The Australian Wheat Board, for in-
stance, has the biggest crop for years
looming up and it is entirely responsible
for its disposal. Revised estimates put
the coming harvest at 436 million
bushels, and if this is down considerably
from the 500 million bushels first esti-
mated, it is still an enormous lot of
wheat to dispose of on a world market
heavily clouded by surpluses in most
of the major wheat-producing countries.
As for meat, the Australian Meat
Board, though unlike the Wheat Board,
it does not itself market produce, is
the guiding light to producers in
marketing and currently has the
problem of how to alleviate local diffi-
culties arising from the temporary halt
in meat exports to the U.S., a market
which takes the bulk of our beef exports
and is by far the biggest export market
for Australian meat overall.
We didn’t expect to see the day when
the Australian Wheat Board enlisted
the services of one of the top PR firms.
But it has arrived and the first perform-
ance revealed a not unfamiliar line-up
of Japanese, to whom the Board is
trying (and with great success) to sell
more wheat in the face of hot overseas
competition, especially from France.
We’ve been getting an increasing share
of Japan’s wheat imports over the past
five years, largely at the expense of
the U.S. and Canada, thanks largely to
the growing Japanese acceptance of the-
high-protein Queensland “prime hard”'
type of wheat, which beats the others
for price hands down. We’ve lifted our
share of purchases by Japan’s Food
Agency from 13 to 20 percent in the
past year, while that of the U.S.
dropped from 56 to 45 percent and
Canada’s from 35 to 33 percent.
As far as can be ascertained, the Aus-
tralian Meat Board hasn’t appointed an
outside PR agency, but it was pretty
smart off the mark last week in letting
everybody know that a team of its
officers was off to a number of neigh-
boring countries, as well as Asia, to


look at the market prospects. In the
past, the only man to get a publicity
blast going off on a meat mission has
been Mr. McEw'en, a fellow well
equipped anyway to blow" his owm
trumpet both coming and going to meat
rendezvous, in his case usually in the
U.S. Anyhow", quite apart from the
emergency situations calling on the
boards for better publicity efforts, it
would be salutary if more could be
done by the boards and the industries
they represent to alert a complacent
public to the facts. Rural exports, on
which the viability of the domestic
economy uniquely depends, don’t simply
sell themselves but depend on tireless
efforts of a highly competent sales force
alert to the opportunities in a con-
tinually fluctuating w"orld market, and
quite often on delicate diplomacy play
by board officers untrained in the arts
of the diplomatic service, and some-
times with only a nodding acquaintance
with the marketplace.
MEN AND MATTERS
HUNGRY THOUGH most punters
were at Flemington last Tuesday, this
was the fault of the horses they were
on, not of Mr. Frank Dennis, whose
group was doing most of the catering.
The 50-year-old dynamo of the Mel-
bourne catering world had just arrived
back from an eight-week whirlwind
world tour to see they were fed. His
tour was as much directed to seeing
Australian chefs winning a world
catering contest in Germany as to bring-
ing himself up to date on overseas
developments in his central lines of
business, which include running seven
hotels in Victoria (five owned and two
leased by the group, including the
Tower at Hawthorn, whose beer turn-
over is the top of the State).
Mr. Dennis, whose set-up now has a
turnover of about $l6 million, is the
Frank Dennis
Donald Junor
acme of modesty about his beginnings
and subsequent progression to the fore-
front of Victoria’s independent
hoteliers. His father played about with
pubs for a time and set up his first
family one out in Coburg, opposite
Pentridge jail, but found he had more
heart for petrol stations and so forth
than serving liquor. So Frank and his
two brothers (one older, one younger)
took it on. When the war came, Frank,
whose eyes are not the best, carried on
here while his brothers went overseas
to war. He gradually built up his chain
of hotels and probably the biggest out-
side catering business in the country,
coming first into North Melbourne and
thence extending as far out as Chelten-
ham and Frankston, where his name is
now legion.
When Courage entered the field,
Dennis became an object of that com-
pany’s affection and, to woo him,
Courage allotted him a substantial wad
of its shares in the hope of capturing
his taps from Carlton (which he still
serves ad lib). These shares will be
thrown in with the rest of the group’s
assets when he floats off the business.
This is expected to be around March
next year. Apart from those shares, the
group has some very valuable freeholds
and the goodwill that goes with Frank
being the liveliest and most forward-
looking of Melbourne’s caterers.
Mr. Dennis is brimming with new
ideas on matters well outside his own
business orbit. On his recent world
tour he was dismayed at the feebleness
of Australia’s efforts to promote immi-
gration and thinks private enterprise
should take over to give more of the
personal touch which he found so lack-
ing in Australian immigration officials
in Britain and Europe (his coolness on
Australia Blouse in London on this
score is close to freezing point). In his
own business, he’s been scouting the
world for ideas on how best to improve
the management of his hotels and cater-
ing, and he’s going to make a start at
implementing some of his findings right
away. As well as being a big family man
with eight children, Frank Dennis is
also a great sportsman. Lie’s chairman
of the Hawthorn Rowing Club, and
when in Germany at the culinary
“games,” one fine summer Sunday, he
had a row on the Rhine at Frankfurt.
CANNED FISH IMPORTER ind dis-
tributor Captain Products Ltd. w r ould
round off the retail food activities of the
food industry supplier Mauri Bros, and
Thomson, thinks chairman and manag-
ing director Donald Junor. Mauri Bros,
is already in canned soups, baked
beans, and so on, through its Pick-Me-
Up Products, acquired seven years ago.
So last week it made a $5.3 million
offer for the fish company, in wLich the
Mansfield family has a dominant
interest. Its consistently high earnings
and small capital no doubt appealed
to the cautious and reticent Mauri Bros.
Junor, now 60, has been guiding the
great string of trading divisions that
make up this complex and highly suc-
cessful group from the managing
director’s seat since 1951. He came to
the company from the accountancy
profession, a hard decision at the time
but one he has never regretted. He
was in business as Sands Junor and Co.
and became an outside director of
Mauri Bros, in 1949. A year after
crossing over to full-time with Mauri
he assumed the chair as well. The
company’s business takes him to Britain,
Europe, and the U.S.A. quite frequently,
and to New Zealand, where there are
171 operations (compared with 51 in
Australia), twice a year.
Junor joined the board of the AMP
in 1966 and is chairman of Nightingale
Supply Co. Ltd., maker and distributor
of detergents and disinfectants.
During the war he served in the
Ninth Division, seeing action in Syria.
He became chief signals officer and a
full colonel. From his home in
Wahroonga he slips down to Pittwater
to relax on his boat.
STERLING
CONTRACTING OUT
QUIETLY BUT IRREVERSIBLY the
U.K. Treasury and the Bank of England
continue to guide sterling toward the
end of its role as an international
currency. The latest move has banned
the provision of credit by U.K. banks to
cover the shipment of goods between
countries outside the sterling area and
will bring home to roost once and for
all some £lOO million as credits at
present outstanding are repayed.
The banks of the City of London are
understandably up in arms not only at
being deprived of some extremely lucra-
tive business but also because they see
the writing on the wall that London’s
role as a world financial centre is being
deliberately undermined. They argue
that the profits earned by the credit are
valuable invisible earnings which the
Treasury can ill afford to lose. Some
have even suggested that the credits
are so short —normally a period of three
or six months —that they could be
included in the country’s reserves
rather than treated as a capital outflow
in the balance of payments. The
merchant and clearing banks have quite
obviously been taken by surprise. There
have been some hurried comings and
goings at the Bank of England as repre-
sentations were made in the hope of
getting the. new regulations modified.
But it was all a bit like trying to halt
the course of history.
The Treasury remains unmoved. It
considers that the size of the country’s
debts and the paucity of its reserves
make it out of the question for sterling
to go on financing other people’s trade.
Similar restrictions were imposed at the
height of the 1957-58 crisis and were
removed some months later. The fact
that the new restrictions have been
imposed at a time of relative calm
makes it look as if the latest decision
is immutable.

Speculator’s Diary
WHEN THE TIDE TURNS
FOR THESE OILS
I'LL BE RIGHT THERE
OIL HAS BEEN a rather dirty three-
letter word for the past few months.
But now it looks as if the tide might
eventually be turning. Not that any-
thing new has been found or that any
exciting wells are actually going down
at the moment (apart from the promis-
ing Magellan Tyler Number 1 well). It
is just that the market may have over-
reacted downward. So, for the first time
in weeks, the oil stocks in my portfolio
have turned up and I think they are in
for a further rise. So I’ve jumped into
four of them, Oil Search (an old
favorite on which I a'm currently losing
a packet), Exoil, Australian Oil and
Gas, and newly listed Genoa Oil.
The reason for buying Oil Search is
largely because, if they were good buy-
ing at the $1.12 I paid in the halcyon
days of three months ago, they are even
better buying at only 57 cents, despite
the failure of the Ini well. This is a
solid improvement on the previous
week’s price of only 43 cents, which
looks to me like a real bounce off the
bottom. And with good reason. It now
seems highly unlikely that Esso will
pull out of its drilling agreement with
Oil Search in the Gulf of Papua, despite
the disappointment at Ini, which has
not robbed the area of all its interest
by any means.
Now, according to Quentin
Cameron’s “Oil Digest,” Esso has
carried out extensive seis'mic work over
other areas in this farmout from Oil
Search and “may have located other
drilling targets whose prospects are
unaffected by the Ini result.” So he
concludes that it is unlikely that Esso
would vacate its position in such a
promising region, particularly in view
of what Phillips are doing in the neigh-
boring allotment. Cameron retails some
stories circulating about Phillips that
they are reluctant to disclose the true
potential of their Papuan offshore areas
in view of the offshore leases that will
soon be available farther to the south
and for which Phillips does not want
too much competition or too severe
Government requirements. Although
Cameron says these stories are almost
certainly untrue, they have
some support because of the cloak of
secrecy which Phillips put over its
Uramu operations and by its failure to
test Pasca Number 1 well satisfactorily.
The attraction of Exoil at the moment
has nothing to do with oil, but with
its Mt. Painter uraniu'm leases. The
float of its associate company Petromin
NL should see some useful information
on the Mt. Painter uranium deposit,
which it shares among the group, being
made public; some hint of the pos-
sibilities of commercial exploitation of
Mt. Painter should surely come out
before Petromin hits the 'market. And
there are plenty of opportunities for
releasing this kind of news in the coming
annual reports and annual meetings of
Exoil and Transoil. All this should
push the group along again at last,
although the number of wounded bulls
waiting for a slight price rise to enable
them to quit this stock may well limit
its prospects of a really good price rise.
The reason for buying Australian Oil
and Gas is not because the company
has announced anything, or that any-
thing is likely to be announced in the
immediate future. It is simply because
the market looks to have gone down too
far, and is now past its worst. AOG
gives a reasonable dividend return (tax-
free) as an investment, quite apart
fro'm its appeal as a speculative oil
prospector, through its income from its
stake in the Moonie and Alton oil-
fields in Queensland.
Genoa oil options are also in the
portfolio simply because of their situ-
ation in the market. There has been
a lot of selling of these -since the stock
was listed last Thursday. The com-
pany’s first drilling target will be off-
shore Western Australia, south of the
Barrow Island oilfield. This is to be
drilled early in the new year in an
8000 ft. stratigraphic test hole. The
first week’s trading could well have
seen the exit of the bulk of the stags
and so options could provide a cheap
way into a nicely speculative situation.
To finance this and increase my kitty,
which is shortly to be disbursed, I sold
100 of my BHP shares, taking the view
that there were too many in the port-
folio even though I’m certain they
will be over the $2O mark early in the
new year. On the basis of first in, first
out, I lost $4B on the deal. I also sold
my White Crow at a loss of $166. The
takeover I had hoped for does not
seem to be panning out; the bird
appears to have flown.
AH this leaves kitty at $5457.

BRIEFLY
7"/]£ economy, a Treasury Information Bulletin sees the
Australian economy as buoyant but delicately balanced;
the first three months of the 1968-69 financial year
‘ have been distinguished by “strong expansion in
activity and demand.”
October’s imports reached a record $329 million, yet
record exports, also, at $296.5 million were
insufficient to prevent a trading deficit of $32.5 million;
the four months to October now throw down a
$166.8 million deficit nearly double last year’s
corresponding figure.
Two leading car-makers, Ford Australia and
General Motors-Holden’s, anticipate a peak 450,000 new
motor-vehicle registrations for the current year.
The Federal Government eventually decided not to cut
the $l.lO a bushel advance payment on wheat; rural
credits payments to farmers through marketing authorities
will thereby hit a record level in 1968-69.
Dr. J. F. Cairns thinks the Tariff Board is setting out to
“demolish a significant part of Australian
secondary industry.”
The markets ßy and large it turned out quite a dull
week on Australian share markets, yet many investors
must have been glad to see some of the principal mining
counters take a kick upward. Oils, too, received a late
stimulus, accompanied by a fairly massive stagging of the
newly listed Genoa. Industrials are still mainly reacting
to special circumstances.
BHP went forward exactly $1 to finish at $18.15 and
among the string of mining advances were: CGA, $7.30
(up 40 cents), CRA, $17.00 ($1), Western Mining,
$9.70 (40 cents), Broken Hill South, $4.30 (10 cents),
Metals Exploration, $5.40 (70 cents), Peko, $10.20
(30 cents), and King Island Scheelite, $12.70 (20 cents).
Two sugars, Fairymead (up 25 cents) and Gibson Howes
(up 20 cents), both closed at $1.75. Captain Products
added 12 cents to touch $5.32, while Mauri Bros, slipped
12 cents to $1.60. Slater Walker jumped $l.lO to $5.90.
The bond market is seeing some juggling to adjust
to the new, non-rebatable issues.
On quiet dealings, London equities have effected a
strong recovery.
Friday saw Wall Street make good gains on hopes of
big increases in new business spending next year.
Companies: There’s been another angry reaction to a
“first come-first served” bid . . . Directors of Lawrence
and Hanson took “great exception” to a raid on almost
25 percent of the capital by an unknown; the operating
brokers refused to disclose names and duly went ahead
to complete the com'mission . . . Sydney piecegoods
merchant Chapmans, which had suffered two of these
assaults under protest, found the recommended Industrial
Equity withdraw from a formal takeover and will pre-
sumably fall into the hands of Brisbane investor Alexanders
... In wriggling away from the Hooker grasp, Hotel
Metropole is able to make a two-for-five share offer for
Australian Motel Industries . . . It’s probably no surprise
that Washington H. Soul, on the way to securing Deposit
and Investment, announces a one-for-four bonus and retention
of the 28-year-old 15 percent payout.
How justified the cheer about sugar is remains to be
seen . . . Anyhow, Fairymead has lifted its interim from
3 to 5 percent and looks like achieving a record crop . . .
On the pastoral side, Dalgety’s attempt to secure New
Zealand and Australian Land is opposed by directors and
biggest shareholder Pioneer Sugar; the offer “failed
to match the underlying asset value of the company.”
Australia’s biggest producer of transformers, Tyree
Industries, is looking forward to 1970, when major
acquisitions should allow it to double output; meanwhile,
the latest year yielded only a 4.4 percent profit advance
and a 15 percent dividend . . . Two years of setback
have been reversed by Clyde Industries, which lifted
earnings by 31 percent to $1,691,868 despite a 60 percent
taxation increase and had no trouble with its usual
15 percent.
Most of the increase in Ansett Transport’s 1967-68
income came from the airlines, which accounted for $B7
million of the full $l2B million income; the group is still
helping the 49.7 percent-owned Universal Telecasters
Queensland . . . United Telecasters Sydney (Channel 10)
is still losing, but sees a smaller loss for the six 'months
ending December . . . Such troubles are not for Queensland
Press, which sent profit from $2,466,178 to $2,651,435
and dividend from 15 to 20 percent.
And, of course, there’s no worry for brewer Tooth,
whose interim dividend becomes 8f percent (previously
85 percent) and whose sales and profit for the six
months to September were an “improvement.”
Burns Philp’s insurance associate, Queensland Insurance,
comes to light with a one-for-four bonus . . . Financier
Mercantile Credits is making a one-for-five par issue to
raise $1.4 million and will hold its seven-year-old
percent payout.
The miners looked relatively sedate until Broken Hill
South came along with more than 1000 million tons of
phosphate reserves, most of which “will be brought into
commercial use”; Cobar copper is also to be expanded . . .
In reverse, Great Northern proposes to close its Queensland
tin mine—l 4 'months after public flotation . . . Silver
Valley has bought out the Mawson coal project’s minority
shareholders . . . Gold operations of Great Boulder
produced an expected loss; the group holds out hopes
for Mount Martin nickel.

What makes a champion in freestyle
swimming? Experts say, “Watch the turns-a
strong stroke isn’t enough to win.”
“In the new turn,” they advise, “the
swimmer never touches with his hands. As he
approaches the wall, he begins his
overhead tumble with a downward stab
of his right arm, twists as his feet hit, then
explodes forward with a powerful push off.”
Their conclusion-“ Experience
and smart coaching develop a
championship turn.”
That’s the Timken Company story.

NORTH BROKEN HILL LIMITED
Chairman reviews Mine activities, Company’s investments
and exploration programme
The Annual Meeting of shareholders of North Broken Hill Limited
was held in Melbourne on Thursday, 24th October.
Highlights of the Address by the Chairman, Mr. M. L. Baillieu, were:-
V,. 1
H
mm
FINANCIAL: Referring to
the Company’s Surplus
from Operations, which was
approximately $270,000 less
than the previous year, after
higher provisions for Taxa-
tion and Royalty, Mr. Bail-
lieu said that production
was lost due to 15 stop-
work meetings held by the
Broken Hill Mining Unions
during the year. Sales of
market lead at 63,136 tons
exceeded production by
4,384 tons, but zinc concen-
trate sales were lower than
production. Despite re-
duced production and lower
lead and zinc prices, gross
revenue was up by $268,000.
This was mainly due to the
increase from 117.5 cents
to 178.5 cents in the price
of silver, which added
$2,235,000 to the Com-
pany's income.
Mine expenditure was
$90,000 lower than the pre-
vious year. There was a re-
duction of $315,000 in the
amount spent on the re-
treatment of slime residues.
Over the last 5 years wages,
salaries and loadings ex-
cluding lead bonus, have
increased by approximately
38% and the Company
faces further increases. The
Company's staff is contin-
uously studying methods to
improve operating efficiency
to counter such increases.
THE MINE: In referring
to the Mine, Mr. Baillieu
said that its production pro-
gramme is related to its ore
potential and, therefore, the
current deepening of No. 3
Shaft to 5,300 feet is of
great importance.. Its com-
pletion will permit deeper
drilling, and provide more
knowledge of the ore bear-
ing horizons presumed to
be below it.
On the Northern Leases it
appears that future drilling
must be aimed at deeper
targets than in the past.
LEAD: The most discon-
certing aspect of the recent
industrial stoppage was that
The Broken Hill Associated
Smelters Pty. Ltd. found
great difficulty in meeting
commitments for sales of
lead. At a time of increas-
ing world production, the
danger of interruptions to
production was that sales
outlets for the Broken Hill
Mining Industry could be
lost.
The effect of the stoppages
and the U.S.A. smelter
strikes was that the situa-
tion of over supply which
the Chairman last year pre-
dicted for about this time
appeared to have been ad-
vanced into next year. The
buoyant demand for lead
should continue.
SILVER: Although there
would no doubt be price
fluctuations from time to
time, the buoyancy of de-
mand for industrial silver
should result in North’s
silver production having a
satisfactory future.
ZINC: Power restrictions at
the E Z plant caused North’s
zinc concentrate sales to be
lower than its production
during the year. However,
stocks have been reduced
since the close of the 1968
financial year.
Mr. Bail I ieu said that he felt
that producers of lead and
zinc were becoming increas-
ingly conscious of their re-
sponsibility for maintaining
supplies at levels reason-
ably equated to demand.
INVESTMENTS: Mr. Bail-
lieu said that the most im-
portant of the Company’s
assets was the mine at
Broken Hill. Nevertheless,
the Company’s investment
income was already making
a big contribution to the in-
come of the company, and
there was considerable
strength in its investment
portfolio.
Principal factors in a de-
crease from investment in-
come in the past year from
$2,739,000 to $2,413,000
were lower dividends from
the Electrolytic Refining
and Smelting Company of
Australia Ltd. and E Z
Industries Ltd. and lower
interest from short term
investment of funds.
E. R. & S’s 1967 financial
year was disappointing, but
the 1968 and 1969 years
should be more satisfactory.
However, because Mt. Lyell
will sell the bulk of its cop-
per concentrates to Japan,
supplies of copper to
E. R. & S. from 1970 will
be reduced.
Short term funds were used
to increase the Company's
holdings of shares in
A. W.M.C. and
Beach Petroleum.
B. had a reasonable
year, despite technical pro-
blems in its zinc plant which
prevented it from operating
at capacity. These problems
are being overcome.
Major additions to the
plant of the Metal Manu-
factures group of com-
panies should greatly add
to its earning capacity.
Mr. Bail 1 ieu said that North
regarded its investments in
Western Mining Corpora-
tion Ltd. and The Broken
Hill Proprietary Company
Ltd. importantly.
Alcoa of Australia Ltd. has
expanded rapidly, and made
a profit of $2,850,000 in
1967. It was planned and
financed originally to refine
210,000 tons of alumina
per annum at Kwinana,
Western Australia, and to
erect a 40,000 ton capacity
aluminium smelter and
associated fabricating equip-
ment at Point Henry, Vic-
toria. Alumina production
will be increased to four
times its original size by
1969, and the aluminium
production will be further
expanded to 90,000 tons by
1972. Much of this latter
expansion is to meet a
sales contract to Japan pro-
viding for a sale of 20,000
tons of aluminium in 1969,
rising to 30,000 tons in
1972. The Power station at
Anglesea, Victoria, will com-
mence operations in 1969.
Mr. Baillieu said that the
investment in Alcoa of Aus-
tralia would be very re-
warding in the future, and
pointed out that 49% of
the Company was owned by
Western Mining Corpora-
tion Ltd., Broken Hill South
Ltd. and North Broken Hill.
OIL: North Broken Hill
owns 3 2 Vi % of Beach
Petroleum and, during the
year, purchased an interest
in Tasman Petroleum Ltd.,
half of which was already
owned by Beach Petroleum.
Tasman Petroleum holds
petroleum exploration licen-
ces on the continental shelf
in New Zealand and has
granted an option to New
Zealand Aquitaine Petro-
leum Ltd. over most of
them. It is expected that off-
shore drilling will com-
mence in late 1970.
COMPANY EXPLORA-
TION: North's exploration
programme covered four
main fields-exploration in
the Mine itself; on the sur-
face within the Company’s
leases; exploration in the
Broken Hill area, and ex-
ploration outside the Broken
Hill district.
The Company has estab-
lished an Exploration Divi-
sion in Melbourne to man-
age its activities outside
the Broken Hill leases.
THE FUTURE: The Chair-
man stated that industrial
problems such as those re-
cently experienced at Broken
Hill could have a deep-
seated effect on the future
of the industry.
He informed the meeting
that the recent wages dis-
pute had been satisfactorily
settled.
CONCLUSION: In conclu-
sion Mr. Baillieu said that
with the expectation of
buoyant Mine revenue, a
strong investment portfolio
and a soundly based ex-
ploration programme, the
Company faces the future
with confidence.

THE LAND
A rural bias
in New Guinea’s
five-year plan
Breaking cocoa pods...estate plantings
to increase
THE HOPE of the sponsors of the
five-year economic development program
in Papua and New Guinea is that by
1972-73 the Territory will be able to
stand on its own feet economically and
that the native population will have
taken a sufficiently bigger share in eco-
nomic activity to justify their indepen-
dence politically. The Administration
outlay on the program is to be just short
of $lOOO million on current estimates.
This may not seem such a big sum,
about $2OO million a year, when put
alongside the political target of inde-
pendence, especially when the roots of
the program are set as firmly as they
necessarily have to be in primary
industry. However, when, the World
Bank carried out its survey in 1964, its
recommendations were adopted as the
basis for the program, and planning has
proceeded to this point mainly along
its projected lines.
While primary-industry development
dominates the program, this is not to
say it is lopsided. Integrated with agri-
culture, the plan essays to bring other
possible economic activities, such as
secondary and tertiary industries, for-
ward, as well as advancing social welfare
(education, health, and so forth) in
parallel so as to lift the whole area of
community life to a new level of sophis-
tication against a fuller background of
essential services (roads, telecommunica-
tions, power, etc). However, when it is
realised that even in 1972-73 manufac-
turing industry is expected to be worth
only $l2O million a year (its growth
rate under the plan is 16.5 percent a
year), and that the attainment of even
that figure will depend on whether
substantial private investment is forth-
coming from overseas (this is confi-
dently expected), the key role of
agriculture and other primary industry
in the development exercise is under-
scored.
Of the main primary industries, in-
volved, even in agriculture, the develop-
ment pace is bound to be slow, because
the emphasis there will be on slow-
maturing tree crops and mainly high-
value ones like tea and palm oils. This
will be largely in the hands of indigenes
encouraged to get more into the play
by Government financial and edu-
cational assistance. It is aimed to get
the latter to make about 60 percent
of the new plantings over the five-year
period. If this proves possible, it would
bring their shade of commercial agri-
cultural production up from 38 percent
in 1966-67 to 48 percent in 1972-73.
Alongside this, the plan provides for
a considerable extension of estate plant-
ing of the main crops such as tea, palm
oils, coconuts, and cacao.
The expansion of the Territory’s beef-
cattle population also figures promi-
nently in the plan, though in this
activity indigenes are not expected to
play as significant a part as in agri-
culture. At present, the latter own
relatively few of the Territory’s beef-
cattle herd of around 60,000, which is
expected to rise to 138,000 in five years’
time and to go as high as 300,000 on a
long-term projection.
Compared with agriculture and
cattle, the program for the expansion
of the Territory’s forestry industry
looks surprisingly modest, considering
its vast timber resources, but in set-
ting the increase at only 11 percent in
forestry production by 1972-73 the fact
that expansion in this field will depend
largely on how far the industry can
attract overseas capital has been a
limiting factor. In the past the Terri-
tory has not been all that attractive
on this score, mainly because of the
inhospitable terrain and poor accessi-
bility to the forests, in a country whose
hinterland is still impoverished in roads
and communications (as any of the oil-
search companies who have operated
in it will bear full witness). However,
the economy is expected to get a
gene Val lift from this industry. For one
thing it will provide valuable export
income and, for another, new r employ-
ment opportunities for indigenes, both
directly and in forestry operations
themselves and indirectly from the out-
workings in secondary industry.
The great enigma for the Territory’s
economic planners is, of course, the
possibility that minerals development
could transform a picture which is now
dominated by essentially rural and
trading pursuits. But, although a strik-
ing minerals project, such as being
planned by CRA to exploit copper
deposits at Bougainville, could have a
pervasive effect on economic activity,
this would take a considerable time to
work its way through the relatively
primitive economy from the immediate
region where the project was located
and where the direct impact on local
employment and industry would be
rapid.
A significant minerals discovery on
the mainland of Papua and New Guinea
would have quicker effects on the
economy than one in the islands, but
even this would be unlikely to give the
Territory its signal for an economic
“take-off” in the sense that a rapid
thickening of economic life would
seem likely in the next five years,
at least of sufficient extent to trans-
form what is by nature a rural in-
dustry-based economy. In the absence of
such a discovery, the planners had no-
alternative but to project expansion on
the assumption that, taking first things
first, the best bets were agricultural,
pastoral, and forestry activities, with a
bit of manufacturing industry thrown
in. In doing so, they’ve at least acted on
lines which should widen and improve
roads and communications, whose pre-
sent poverty is the main obstacle to
economic advance.
AGRISEARCH
AMEN TO SPECIALISTS
MELBOURNE’S three professors of
agriculture have recently expounded
their views on the kind of university
training that should be offered to
agricultural scientists. All, in varying
degree, are anti-specialisation. Their
stand could largely determine whether
the existing pattern of farming by
family units will survive. Sir Samuel
Wadham, the emeritus professor, and
a man of virtuoso accomplishment now
commonly regarded as a genuine sage,
equivocates least. Addressing himself
to the problem of devising and main-
taining a broad curriculum in this age
of specialisation, he declares, “A large
part of modern, so-called research will
ultimately be found to have little value

against seeking a career in scientific
research because it is unrewarding.
Nobel Prize winners are exceedingly
rare! However, he feels that applied
investigations carried out for industry
can be useful and personally satisfy-
ing. District agricultural officers and
farm advisers quietly perform this kind
of valuable work and enjoy it.
Professor H. C. Forster, presently
occupying the chair and, no doubt,
buffeted by the protagonists of both
philosophies, adopts a less rigid posture
while leaning toward the views of his
predecessor: “A broad agricultural
training is desirable in the under-
graduate course as a basis for a proper
understanding of the integration of the
different sciences in agriculture whether
the ultimate aim of the student is re-
search or general agricultural science.”
Until now, only the Melbourne course
and that presented by the University
of New England have persisted with
the broad approach and are distinctly
different from the other six schools
which enable specialisation to begin
relatively early. But Professor Forster
is wavering. He continues, “I believe
we will have to face up in the near
future to some degree of specialisation
in our undergraduate course . . .”
Professor Forster is due to retire at
the end of this academic year. It will
be interesting to see whether his suc-
cessor maintains the old line.
In countenancing such a change,
Professor Forster appeals strongly for
an up-grading of agricultural education
at all levels. He would like to see the
colleges raise their standards, and
thereby fill the gap made as a result of
teaching more intensive courses at the
university. Similarly, agriculture should
be taken more seriously in the country
high schools and technical schools. At
each of these levels the courses should
be integrated under the guidance of a
control committee. Workable systems
of adult education for the farmers them-
selves must be devised on a wide scale.
At present, only 2 percent of farmers’
sons receive any agricultural education.
It is a fact that farmers who have
joined farm clubs, or otherwise accepted
guidance by a farm adviser, have raised
their net incomes by as much as five-
fold within a few years. This, surely,
is evidence enough of the vital import-
ance of agricultural training for the
farm owner-operators. It also supports
Professor Wadham’s view, because no
scientific breakthrough can be envis-
aged that would have such a resound-
ing impact on the farmer’s welfare.
The traditional way of food and fibre
production by means of the family farm
seems highly worth maintaining in this
country for the next several generations
at least. However, the trend to ultra-
large, impersonal farms is gathering
momentum under the prevailing econ-
omic exigencies. To avert this pressure
now seems impossible, but its effects
can be alleviated by farmer education.
Well-informed, highly skilled farmers
can survive on relatively small holdings.
If there is any universal law in biology
it is that the ,more intensive the care
the greater is the product. The success
of Japanese farming provides practical
and positive proof, while the Russian
experience with large-scale farming
holds plenty of examples of failure.
Our own recent history contains more
than a few instances of economic
disaster overtaking big operators. The
small farmer owning his own acres and
personally responsible for his own sur-
vival is willing to take sufficient care
and make the requisite effort.
It is a pity that we cannot afford to
await the final outcome of the change
to non-family farming in America,
where the small landholder has already
lost the battle. A statistical study cover-
ing the last financial year has disclosed
that the average American farmer now
receives the greater part of his income
from non-farm sources or employment.
Last year more people stopped farming
entirely than in any previous year. At
last count, .more than half of America’s
poor families lived in rural areas, and
the overwhelming majority were whites
rather than Negroes. But whether they
were white or black, their educational
attainment was more closely correlated
with their poverty than the size of their
farms, the area in which they were try-
ing to farm, or any other factor.
Professor R. L. Reid, the inaugural
professor of agriculture at the new
university of La Trobe, has read the
message on the wall. He has designed
an even less specialised course than
the one at the old University of Mel-
bourne. La Trobe does not even have
a farm and he has cut the number of
hours spent in formal laboratory teach-
ing to about half that spent at Mel-
bourne and New England. And in
complete contrast to what happens else-
where, the further a student advances
through the four-year course, the less
time he will spend in the labs. The
final year will concentrate on combin-
ing all the knowledge gained during
the course with farm management
economics. The primary goal is to turn
out potential teachers and advisers. He
is not interested in creating soil scien-
tists, plant pathologists, or any other
kind of specialist. The unfortunate
thing is that he won’t have any gradu-
ates until 1972, and then they will only
begin to make an impact along about
1980. Will they come on the scene too
late and be too few? Can the old agri-
cultural faculties get behind him and
start producing graduates equipped to
staff the much-needed colleges, tech-
nical schools, and farmers’ short
courses?

NO HALF MEASURES
TO DEVELOP
SOUTH'S PHOSPHATES
MINING • SECURITY ANALYSIS • BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS • THE MARKETS ft OIL TABLE
COLLINS HOUSE used to have a
reputation for doing things by halves—
half in only safe mining propositions,
half in safe share investments. That
was until Sir Lindesay Clark got the
house moving in exploration, using two
of the three member companies
Western Mining Corporation Ltd. and
Broken Hill South Ltd. The third
Collins House .company, North Broken
Hill l td., remained the quiet doyen of
the group—an appropriate role for the
patriarch company.
Now, Broken Hill South Ltd. presents
much the same “go” in its development
of Australia’s sole commercial phos-
phate deposit in the Duchess district
of Queensland. The deposit has already
been assessed at containing 1350 million
tons of ore of about 20 to 25 percent
(figures have not been given) phos-
phate.
From the early figures it seems likely
that the Duchess phosphate deposit will
need a scale of economics much the
same as those used in the Pilbara iron-
ore giants. The rewards per ton of
mined (open-cut) product seem likely
to be about $lO a ton —much the same
as the Pilbara iron. Costs will be
slightly higher, since the product will
have to be concentrated by something
like 40 percent from the mined grade
to the freightable and salable grades
around 32 percent phosphate. This
upgrading will cost something like $2
a ton, reducing the net income at
Duchess to about $8 a ton.
The disparity between the $lO a ton
at Duchess and the $lB a ton world
price for the product lies in the freight
costs. South’s intention is a new port
and rail link with the Gulf of Car-
pentaria—presumably around “prawn”
town Karumba. Townsville is too far,
despite the fact that a rail link is
already there.
The economics of this operation de-
mand that production be immense, just
as in the case of the Pilbara iron. That
in itself creates a marketing problem.
Australia’s own phosphate requirements
are about million tons a year. The
South’s project will have to produce
two to three times more than this to
be viable. Export markets are available,
more so when the Nauru guano phos-
phate deposits begin to run down in
three or four years’ time.
STOCK EXCHANGE
SYDNEY'S REFORMS
IF A PERSON has to have a keeper,
then a keeper of one’s own choice is
preferable. So the Sydney Stock
Exchange, fresh from the victorious
collapse of one of its member firms last
year, plans “spot audits” of member-
firms’ accounts. Never again does the
Exchange want to see a build-up of
insolvency cloaked by once-a-year
audits and hidden for the rest of the
time by trading strategems.
The scheme was put to a talk-out
of Sydney members last week. The
Stock Exchange will appoint a panel of
five auditor organisations, and member
firms will have their choice of “police-
man” from the five. Snap audits will
bring added protection to investors.
However, with rather a remarkable
record of non-defalcation of clients’
money, the cost of continual snap audits
of the 50-odd firms in Sydney may be
greater than the cost of an enlarged
fiduciary bond for member firms.
Probably of more importance to the
ultimate development of the Exchange
role in the securities’ industry was the
discussion on the future of membership
of the Exchange. The major proposal
before members is a loosening of the
nexus between seated members and the
so-called non-member partners of the
various firms. At present, a firm on
the Sydney Stock Exchange may have
only one “non-member” partner for
every seated member, and that non-
member partner may have no more than
45 percent of profit.
The new scheme is to cut out the
second-class membership implied by
the “non-member” nomenclature; the
partner without a seat on the Exchange
will be called a plain partner, and, if
the proposals go through, will be able
to have more than 45 percent of the
profits.
The initial relaxation of non-member
numbers is neatly geared to prevent
sole traders from expanding beyond the
present one-for-one basis; whether by
accident or design, the days of the sole
trader are clearly limited.
THE CHARTIST SAYS: Investors must be becoming confused over the
future direction of WESTERN MINING CORPORATION LIMITED. It was
suggested in June, 1968, that the possibility of a further target of $25 could be
considered. This was discounted with the break of the
1967/68 rising trendline and the changing trend of the
market, about which several warnings have been given
in this column. In the short-term, if prices rise above
$10.20 on increased volume, a move to approximately
$l2 would be possible. However, the probability of a
decline to the first support level about $7 could be
considered and the overall top suggests a more pessimistic
target of $4.50. Last sale price on 7/11/68 —$9.90.

BISCUIT BUSINESS
DAYS OF SUNSHINE
WHEN STOCK is good, even with
country gallopers performing in the
city as Terminal proved twice at
Fiemington last week, it pays to keep
backing them. So when the Ballarat-
oriented (but Melbourne-registered and
-headquartered) Sunshine Biscuits,
which The Bulletin has been rather
sour on in the past, was revealed a
winner by Britain’s United Biscuits
Ltd., one of the world’s biggest biscuit
businesses, in its quest for factory
space to make biscuits for the Aus-
tralian and Asian markets, it looked
like paying off for those faithful share-
holders over the past two dividendless
years. Even so, this had little effect
on Sunshine’s $1 shares, which haven’t
looked like knocking on the door of
par for an age (they’ve been up to
88 and as low as 55 cents this year),
although they did manage to put on
a cent or two on small volume by the
end of the week.
Looking at the recent record, this
company, which paid a steady ten per-
cent from moderately well-covered
earnings for the six years to June, 1966
(it has been a stock exchange ani’mal
since 1947 when the proprietaries
George Farmer and Sunshine Biscuits
merged), just about went into the red
in 1966-67 (profit $1315). Last year
the clouds rolled back a shade when
profits recovered to $36,959, providing
earnings of about 8 percent, albeit
none of them reaching shareholders.
Encouraged by the latest result and
mindful that the net assets backing is
$1.37 a share, the market took the
shares up to 88 cents, but in the past
month they’ve fallen back with the rest
of the industrials market. At the cur-
rent price of 70 cents and with the
United Biscuits bird in hand, it is not
difficult to make a case for buying
them.
The beauty of the arrangement with
Linked Biscuits is that it virtually
assures that the company’s Ballarat
factory will be working at full capacity
(which it wasn’t doing before UB
brought its McVitie dough into the
bake) for as long ahead as the U.K.
biscuit-maker continues its assault on
the market here. What is more, if
that assault proves successful, it looks
as if expansion of manufacturing
beyond Sunshine’s present capacity will
be provided by Sunshine itself. Because,
talking in Melbourne last week, the
new boys from Britain said they were
not going to manufacture on their own
account here. The new company
they’ve set up is only to interest itself
in management (keeping an eye on
Sunshine presumably) and marketing,
including exports. At present the nevv-
comer is aiming to get about 3 percent,
rising to 5 percent, of Australia’s $72
million biscuit market, but obviously,
as this would be pretty small beer for
United Biscuits, its export intentions,
using Australia as a base, could be just
as important, if not more so, an object
in its invasion.
Looking some way ahead, it is quite
possible, if success attends the efforts
of the L’.K. company here and in
exports, that it would no longer be
content simply to have Sunshine as the
manufacturer of its products (eight
varieties of biscuits at the moment)
on a contract basis, but would make an
offer for that concern. Scouting the
possibilities in that direction certainly
makes the shares look attractive at
their current price, especially as net
tangible assets per share are almost
double this price.
KEMPTHORNE & COURAGE
THIRSTING FOR FUNDS
GETTING A LISTING on the Stock
Exchanges takes companies different
ways. Some are struck by the sheer awe
of the occasion and are reduced to
silence and often inaction. For others,
the experience is exhilarating. They
skip the dignity and decorum and
plunge into action to show how good
it feels to be released from their pro-
prietary-company fetters. One of the
latter is Kempthorne Mistral, which
was listed about four months ago and
has been breaking its neck ever since
to keep the market happy. As one glad
tiding has followed another in breath-
taking succession, the $1 shares have
gone from strength to strength until,
after last week’s one-for-four new issue
at $1.50, thev were heading for the $3
mark (latest price $2.80). Other recelit
events were the 1967-68 profit
announcement showing a rise from
$328,934 to $418,084 on the year; a
successful takeover of Celco Holdings
Ltd., which gives the merger the lead-
ing position in the Australian fan and
fractional - horsepower electric - motor
market; and, last week, news of a pri-
vate placement of 120,000 shares at
$2.80 as a quid pro quo for transfer
of certain assets to the group.
Once on the move as a newly listed
company, there’s no harm in making
full use of the superior capital-raising

facilities in that rarified atmosphere, but
shareholders who have to put in more
cash so soon may feel that the pace is
a bit too hot. At any rate a comparison
of the balance sheet after a year of this
with the one for 1967-68 will make
interesting reading. At least some
shareholders will trust that the news
will ease and consolidation will begin.
Kempthorne may soon find itself in
good company among the new floats
because Courage Breweries Ltd., after
a successful float from which the froth
from stags has now almost all blown
away, leaving the shares on the top side
of a dollar (latest price $1.15), is said
to be considering making a new issue
of ordinaries before very ’ long. , The
background to this is that demand for
the new brew has exceeded the original
expectations and funds will be required
to extend the Broadmeadows brewery
to make a lot more of it. As it is, appar-
ently, the liquid position is a bit tight,
even counting in $2 million or so of
unsecured loans from British Tobacco
and Courage (U.K.), two of the major
shareholders. The prospect of a new
issue at such an early state in the com-
pany’s market could seemingly not
deter shareholders, though the nearer
to par the better (Ke'mpthorne looks
as if it will get away with its new issue
with a 50 percent premium on it).
However, the matter is certainly not
yet cut and dried. Now the stags have
left the field the prospect for the shares
looks fair, so the board could do a lot
worse than wait and perhaps issue
some field reports (from the pubs) like
Kempthorne has done. A Courage take-
over of Carlton at this stage is not,
however, conjectured.
Behind the
balance sheets
WHEAT ALSO PROVIDES
GOOD HARVEST FOR
WAUGH AND JOSEPHSON
ALTHOUGH THE N.S.W. distributor
for Caterpillar, John Deere, and Tow-
motor, Waugh and Josephson Holdings
Ltd., may understandably like to show
a firm and steady uptrend in its profits,
an understatement of 1967 profits by
$184,000 changes a profit improvement
to a profit decline in the latest year.
This is not to say that 1968 was a poor
year, but that the year before was, in
reality, the better one. Regular annual
capital losses on the sale of fixed assets,
mostly not large, are, as always, excluded
from The Bulletin’s calculations of
profits, and past profits are corrected
for under- or over-provisions of tax.
Few would argue that the writing down
of goodwill is an appropriation rather
than a charge before striking the profit,
and Waugh and Josephson concedes
that the addition to stock obsolescence
was a build-up of a reserve from
$252,000 to $352,000 (to approximately
4.5 percent,of stocks which were already
reduced to net realisable value if this
happened to be lower than cost), which
was not a specific nor necessaiy pro-
vision against stocks.
The tax provision for 1968, "at 45c
in the $, compared with 42.4 c in 1967,
also points to a higher real profit in
1967 than the succeeding year, although
pre-tax profits deduced from the tax
provision were level-pegging.
After the traumatic experience of the
early ’sixties, when tightening credit
caught up with an unwise diversification
program, the company has concentrated
on its Caterpillar and John Deere fran-
chises. it has been eager to allow the
build-up of a little fat in the group
accounts, so a doubtful-debts provision
has accumulated $500,000, or approxi-
mately 9 percent of outstanding debts
and bills, and the aforementioned pro-
vision for obsolescence of stocks is 3.8
percent of inventories.
In 1966 the company had a couple of
big bad debts, and wrote-off $124,000;
this was down to $28,000 the next year,
and in 1968 it was not significant
enough to mention, probably of the
order of $20,000. In 1964 the com-
pany made a provision for doubtful
debts of $90,000, raised it to $118,500
in 1965, .and tapered it off to the
$20,000 in 1966, and $51,500 in 1967.
There was no provision made for doubt-
ful debts in 1968, which can be inter-
preted variously as another attempt to
level out profits, or a feeling that there
was no necessity to provide in the latest
year.
Whether up or down, the 1968 profit
was the outcome of an 18 percent ad-
vance in turnover. (Sales showed a
45 percent growth in the past two
years.) The largest cost element con-
trollable by the company, wages and
salaries, has increased 5 percent in
the past two years, 23 percent in the
past 12 months. The latest national
wage decision of a $1.35 rise means a
further substantial addition to company
wages bills for 1968-69.
The best thing going for Waugh and
Josephson this year is the prospect of
a record or near-record wheat harvest
in N.S.W. Although drought has ad-
versely affected the company’s profit-
earning capacity in the past four years,
the graziers’ switch to wheat for ready
cash must step up demand for agricultu-
ral equipment, especially harvesters,
and, of course, spare parts, the bread
and butter of most equipment distribu-
tors. The wheat harvest for N.S.W. fell
in 1967-68 from a record 202 million
bushels the year before, to only 88 mil-
lion bushels, of almost no benefit to
Waugh and Josephson, but this year
record acreages have been sown to
wheat, and N.S.W. is expecting an
abundant harvest this month.

ELDER SMITH GOLDSBROUGH MORT LIMITED
ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERS
Tuesday, 5th November, 1968
ADDRESS BY THE CHAIRMAN, MR. H. N. GILES, O.B.E.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
When we reported on results at the half year, we
advised that while earnings, at that stage, were slightly
ahead of those for the same period of the previous
year, the increase was not nearly sufficient to offset
the rise in expenses.
In that report, we mentioned the urgent need for
good rains in the drought-affected States, for the
Queensland-N.S.W. drought persisted for two years
(three years and much longer in some parts) and
naturally we hoped that would not be repeated.
Wonderful opening rains not only broke the drought,
but benefited most of Australia’s principal areas of
greatest production.
We have entered the 1968-69 year with at least a
happier outlook ahead of us — and ahead of our
clients — from a seasonal point of view, with every
prospect of a record wheat harvest which could exceed
450,000,000 bushels, and an auction wool clip which
could exceed 5,000,000 bales.
Nevertheless, there are still clouds on the horizon.
For those in rainfall areas which enable them to grow
wheat, prospects are reasonably satisfactory, despite
the effects of the reduction in the Government’s price
guarantee, Spring rains which might have been in-
adequate for some, and the likely difficulty in finding
adequate world outlets for the harvest.
For those in the heavier rainfall areas who cannot
grow wheat, conditions and prospects are somewhat
grim, for they are really caught in an acute cost-price
squeeze as costs continue to rise, and world prices for
wool, mutton and lamb run adversely against them.
Good though the beef market has been, the recent
embargo raises some doubt as to the extent to which
we can rely on the important U.S.A. market as
our exports grow, as herds build up in the beef areas
of the North, and as diversification, in the higher rain-
fall wool-growing areas in the South, increases pro-
duction, with farmers seeking to reduce their reliance
on wool, mutton and lamb.
Rain alone does not provide an immediate emergence
of prosperity. Drought losses in flocks and herds
cannot be made good overnight — firstly because there
is no real surplus of breeding stock, secondly because
prices for such as there are tend to rise to uneconomic
levels, and thirdly because far too many farmers are
finding it hard to get money to meet even carry-on
needs.
As a result, we will inevitably see in the Southern
States, the same tendency to build up flocks and
herds by breeding rather than buying, as has been
occurring in Queensland and N.S.W.
While these aspects relate to a very large body of
our clientele, they also apply to us as a Company,
because their effects will inevitably be reflected in the
number of surplus sheep and cattle that will be for
sale and the merchandise, fertiliser, weedicides, pesti-
cides, machinery, implements and other items of farm
need that Growers will be able to afford to buy.
There will be more wool but, although the new
selling season opened up with best Merino values
steady, stronger qualities higher than the levels ruling
at June’s close, and world demand reasonably promis-
ing, prices are still low, even for the better quality
wools, and the prospect of any material increase seems
doubtful.
All in all, therefore, it would be our present view
that our result for 1968-69 cannot be expected to show
any marked improvement on that recorded for the
year just past. In other words, we will emerge from
the effects of drought in the same way as will most
of our clients — slowly.
It is correct that your Company’s business is more
diversified than most others of its kind — the 1967-68
result would not have been as good as it was had
this net been so. Nevertheless, it is still the case,
as we have so often stressed, that our results will
always reflect the fluctuating fortunes of our rural
clientele as their affairs are affected, for better or for
worse.
HIGHLIGHTS FROM THE ACCOUNTS
Our Turnover reached $526,287,000, and was down
only 6.9 percent on 1966-67.
Despite the decline, Group earnings at $45,304,333
showed an increase of some $50,000.
Expenses (before provisions) of running the Group’s
business rose by $1,657,957 (5.2 percent) to $33,563,070,
in the light of which, the Budget increase in Company
Tax was unwelcome, to say the least. It was a
particularly unfortunate impost, coming as it did, on
top of substantially increased charges by Federal,
State and Local Governments in postal and telephone
charges, rates and taxes, rail freights and now, heavy
State stamp duties. We are gradually becoming a
highly taxed country.
Shareholders’ Funds and Special Provisions now total
nearly $76m. Thus, it could be said that the Com-
pany’s funds cover all the Group’s Fixed Assets, Invest-
ments, Merchandise and Other Stocks and Livestock
(totalling some $4').4m.), still leaving some $32.3m.
(including the provision of $5.8m.) towards financing
its Advances, Trade Debtors and Bills Receivable.
Additions to Reserves and Unappropriated Profits
($1.7m.) and Special Provisions ($1.2m.) increased
Shareholders’ Funds and Special Provisions by nearly
$3m. —a satisfactory achievement in a difficult year,
especially as the Provisions for Depreciation of Fixed
Assets were increased to the extent of $1.6m. and, in
relation to other Assets and Contingencies, to the extent
of over $lm., at balance date.
Last year our Advances, Trade Debtors and Bills
Receivable increased bv some $13.7m. It is disturbing
to have to record that the 1968 year saw this item
rise by a further $16.3m. to the very high total of
$111,721,0 .0, the increase being mainly in Advances.
Current Assets are $Slm. greater than Current
Liabilities, while, as to liquidity, Cash, Short Term
Deposits and Government Stock totalled some $26.4m.
at 30th June.
Frofit (after provisions and tax) at $5,420,535, repre-
sents a return of only 7.1 percent on the $75,924,185
which is the Shareholders’ investment in their business.
In our industry, with so much money of necessity
devoted to advances to clients, it is necessary to
handle a huge volume of low earning business if a
reasonable return is to be achieved from the funds
employed. The after-tax profit of $5,420,535 when
related to business handled to produce it at $526,287,000,
represents a net earning, therefore, of only 1.03 percent.
These figures and percentages serve to show that,
while the profits of Pastoral Houses, and the charges
they make in the conduct of the various sections of
their operations, frequently come in for criticism from
some quarters, the final returns are surely modest
when compared with those which are automatically
accepted in many other areas of both commerce and
industry.
RURAL FINANCE
During the past two years, rural advances by all
Pastoral Houses have risen by $64.6m. — from $249.9m.
at 3Cth June, 1966, to $314 5m. in 1968 — and the upward
trend still continues. Comparable figures for Bank
lending to the rural sector show the same trend.
Our share of the increase has been substantial.
Although the demand for finance for the rural
export industries has already assumed such unprece-
dented proportions, it is still unsatisfied. One is
compelled to wonder just where a continuance of
this trend towards heavier indebtedness is leading
our producers, and what is necessary to assist them.
We cannot overlook the fact that exports of rural
primaries provide some two-thirds of our overseas
income, and that our adverse national trade balance
for the 1968 year was some $238m. despite their con-
tribution.
Clearly the call for funds arises from a number of
causes, including — a general cost-price squeeze; the
effects on incomes and individual indebtedness of the
past three years of drought; the failure of last year’s
harvest; very heavy transport costs; the need for
Continued on Page 67


increased mechanisation to reduce labour costs and,
in the longer term, anticipation of continuing effects
of Sterling devaluation and the inevitable ultimate
entry of Britain into the E.E.C. market.
There may be some areas in which we could, perhaps,
be regarded as inefficient producers. In our major
rural industries, however, we are efficient low cost
producers, but our ability to sell at fair values on
world markets is frustrated by the trade barriers
erected against us by so many nations which, neverthe-
less, expect us to buy from them.
As farming becomes more capital intensive on the
one hand, and the effects of drought, low world com-
modity prices and rising internal costs affect profit-
ability on the other, increased efficiency and even
greater per acre productivity are called for. All of
this will necessitate greater capital investment and
better farm management planning and practices.
For our part, our natural concern is to be able to
find the necessary funds to enable us to continue to
meet the reasonable carry-on seasonal needs of our
clients, and so maintain our position in the Industry,
the servicing of which we were formed to carry out.
This we still regard as our primary national respon-
sibility despite the problems which so clearly face not
only us, but all the other Australian Pastoral Houses.
RURAL DEVELOPMENT
The effects of drougnt, crop failure, rising costs and
declining world commodity prices are being reflected
clearly in a flattening out of the rate of Australia’s rural
development. This applies to development, not only
of new country, but also of developed country capable
of increased production.
This would be unfortunate in any event in a country
as badly in need of a continued increase in rural
export income as is Australia. It is even more unfor-
tunate when, also, so many individual farmers are
in such dire need of increased income from increased
production.
To correct this situation, the mere provision of
money for development is not sufficient. The real
necessity is the restoration of at least a reasonable
level of profitability to provide some inducement —
and heaven knows, the man-on-the-land neither needs
nor gets the more profitable returns of commerce and
industry to encourage him to greater effort.
The Government has made a generous initial approach
to the problems related to Sterling devaluation, and
it was pleasing to see some further recognition of the
problem in this year’s Budget. The increase in the
Super Bounty will at least benefit the areas most in
need of assistance, and the long overdue correction
of the anomaly in respect of trace elements removed
an illogical situation in a sensible wav. However, the
Bounty increase really did not do more than up-date
the Super Bounty to a level comparable with that
provided, at a later date, for nitrogenous fertiliser.
Over the years, the Drought Bonds proposal should
assist some in the drought-prone back-country. The
problems of drought and costs in these areas are not
easy to relieve, and the Drought Bond provision is one
step in the right direction.
What is difficult to understand, after the drought
experience of recent years, is the failure of the
Government to provide additional inducement to
encourage greater exploration for and conservation
of bcth water and fodder on rural properties. A
great deal can be achieved in these two areas, and
there can be little doubt that whatever were the cost
to revenue, it would be returned with interest from
increased production over the years ahead. However,
it must be conceded that the Budget concessions, when
added to the devaluation payments, made a generous
aggregate gesture for one year.
Whilst on this general subject, one would be failing
if mention were not made of two other important
aspects badly in need of Government consideration
and action.
The first is the need for Federal-State Government
consideration of State policies which break up so many
leasehold properties, subject to drought, into so-called
“living areas’’ on the expiry of leases. What was a
“living area’’ of years gone by, is only a “peasant
area” today.
More than that, the policy is a dangerous one, in
that it forces so many Growers in the low rainfall
hack-country to build up their flocks and herds beyond
safe carrying capacity in their effort to make ends
meet. When drought occurs — and the areas to which
I refer are historically subject to drought—there is
disaster, or at best great hardship, for the individuals
concerned.
Worse is it that, each such drought year leaves the
affected country with a reduced carrying capacity.
The day could well come when the low-rainfall “living
area” policies of some Governments of today could
create the “dust-bowl” problems of Governments of
tomorrow.
The second is another problem which can onlv be
tackled by Federal and State Governments acting in
concert. In this remark, I refer to Australia’s great lag
in the field of farm-management education and field
extension.
In these areas we are well up with the best in
the work of our scientists — especially that of the
C.S.I.R.O. Where we lag behind is in communicating
the discoveries of the scientist to the man-on-the-land
in a manner which will enable him to apply them,
and so derive full benefit from them.
The Federal Government’s aim in providing substan-
tial funds in this field is commendable but, until
there is adequate action and co-operation by State
Governments, and an adequacy of experienced and
trained personnel to enable sufficient planned effort
in field extension work, we. will continue to lag behind
other countries in communication, education and
productive application of new discoveries.
RISING COSTS
That rising costs, low world commodity prices and
the effects of Sterling devaluation are the principal
problems confronting most producers of rural primary
exports today, is beyond dispute.
However, theirs are not the only exports affected,
for it is clear from the way in which they have flattened
out, that exports of manufactures are being affected
as well, especially following Sterling devaluation.
While capital inflow continues at its recent rate, we
can, perhaps, afford not to be unduly disturbed about
a Current Account deficit of nearly $l,lG3m., but one
wonders just how long, and to what extent, this will
continue.
Situated as we are, so far from most of the major
northern hemisphere markets, we as a Nation have no
greater problem today than that of rising costs, for
our capacity to generate the export income that we
will need to sustain our economic growth, will depend
considerably on our ability to export competitively
on world markets, and this will depend equally on our
success in controlling our internal costs. National
Export Week did much to stimulate widespread public
comprehension of this as a National problem.
However, one week of export stimulus is not enough
Sooner or later, it will be realised that we cannot rely
indefinitely on good fortune to pull rabbits out of
the mineral and oil hat year after year. So too
may we then find that we can no longer rely too com-
placently on capital inflow — in fact even today some
actions and statements, mav, unwittingly or unthink-
ingly, be sowing unjustifiable seeds of doubt overseas
as to our reliability as a safe and stable field for sub-
stantial investment.
If and when this does occur, we may well regret not
having done more today to ensure that such of our
present and potential exports, for which there are
assured world markets, received the encouragement
and cost protection that would have stimulated their
greater growth.
Two-thirds of our export income todav is provided
by our rural primaries, and some 90 percent or more
of this is a net gain in overseas funds. It is probably
safe to say that about 40 percent of our mineral
export income will leave the country to sei’vice imports
of capital goods, overseas debt repayment and dividends.
While it may be popular to say today that we are
becoming decreasingly reliant on rural export income,
I am sure that it is safe to say that we will continue
to be heavily reliant on it for many years to come
One of today’s important cost problems arises from
the confusion created by the wording and implementa-
tion of Arbitration Commission decisions. One can-
not but feel that the Commission, in handling claims
under the Metal Trades Award, tends to ignore the
fact that increased wages, and consequent costs imposed
on the Metal Industries, can be absorbed, only in
part, by improved technical efficiency, and, that, under
the protection of our Tariff Wall, the balance must be
passed on to the Australian consumer as an additive
to the extra tax to be paid on the higher wage.
The ability to shelter behind a Tariff Wall does not
apply to us, and many others like us, nor does it to
our clients who must accept seasonal vagaries as well
as world prices for their produce. For them, rising
costs, including those initiated by Federal, State-and
Local Governments, are certainly outstripping increased
productivity, despite efficiency which is high by world
standards in our major income earners.
In our own case, the 5.2 percent <$1.7m.) increase
m expenses, in a year in which a rise in earnings was
prevented by circumstances equally beyond our control
—drought—is a similar reflection of the rising cost
problem. ~

WOOL AND SHIPPING INDUSTRY PROBLEMS
During the past year, many of the sesrious industry
tasks, to which I referred at our last Meeting as
being so time-consuming for our Management, have
had the full consideration of members of the Aus-
tralian Wool Board, the Australian Wool Industry
Conference, their ad hoc Committees and Wool Brokers.
From these considerations, there emerged a “Joint
Committee,” representative of both the A.W.B. and
the A.W.I.C., which negotiated with all major sections
of the Industry, and with the full co-operation of Wool
Brokers, to a stage where it was felt that there was
general Industry agreement so far as wool marketing
(in the wool-broking sense) was concerned.
There is general acceptance — in Australia, New
Zealand, South Africa and overseas buying countries —
that there is no known satisfactory replacement of
the auction system as the best medium to ensure the
necessary free flow of, and equal access to, the wide
variety of wool types that Australia produces and
sells every year.
Some of the contentious aspects of “Supply Manage-
ment” (a most unfortunate choice of words) still
require to he ironed out and clearly defined. This
latter aspect of definition is important in that the
mill-owner, on the other side of the world, must be
able to understand and have confidence in what is
intended.
The need for the elimination of “small lots,” and a
high level of classing efficiency, appears to be accepted
by all parties. There seems, also, to be general accept-
ance of the need for the introduction and operation
of price-averaging pools for one, two and three-bale
lots from all Growers, although to go beyond this
point would pose some real problems. The aim is to
effect economies, on the one hand, including elimina-
tion of the “star lot” salerooms, and, at the same time,
increase saleroom prices. These “small lots” presently
represent approximately 38% of total offerings.
As to the aspect of Statutory and non-Statutory
Marketing Authorities, Brokers set out and circulated
their views in a pamphlet designed to clarify their
support of marketing control by a non-Statutory
Authority. This was distributed to wool growers, in
an attempt to help them make a dispassionate judg-
ment.
At long last, at their October meeting, unanimity was
achieved by the Grower representatives of the A.W.I.C.
on many important aspects of marketing, including
the establishment of a non-Statutory Authority for a
trial period of three years.
The Australian Wool Board is nresently amending
its original Marketing Plan handed down in October,
1967, in order to embody the decisions taken at last
month’s A.W.I.C. meeting.
The A.W.B. has been authorised by the Conference
to confer with some Industry bodies, and with Govern-
ment, to ensure full co-oDeration in implementing the
amended Marketing Plan. ' Grower organisations
throughout the country are now considering these
compromise proposals, and a further meeting of the
A.W.I.C. is scheduled for 27th November, when the
Conference will have its final opportunity to show that
unanimity still exists when it comes to endorsement
of the amended Wool Board Plan.
It is to be hoped that ultimate resolution of the
long-standing contentious matter of Statutory versus
non-Satutory control of marketing will pave the way
for the Industry to approach other areas of production
and marketing which have not been receiving the
attention their importance warrants. In the overall
costs, from sheep’s back to mill door, wool-brokers’
charges represent a comparatively small percentage of
the total, in which freights (rail, road and sea) and
other costs and charges weigh so heavily. i
All sides of the Industry must accept the challenge
of improvement if it is to meet wool’s present com-
petitive price situation and thereby survive profitably
and expand. It would be our intention to co-operate
fully with the proposed non-Statutory organisation
once November tells us the final extent to which Grower
unanimity exists and amended plans are clear.
Since 30th June, wool prices have changed for the
better, though it is disappointing that the higher
quality Merino wools seem to have reached at least
a temporary ceiling.
As compared with the level ruling at 30th, June,
values for fine wools of 64-70’s quality are par — 2|
percent better and Strong Merinos — 60’s — are some
2| percent better. There has been an improvement of
11 percent for wool of 56’s and 58’s quality, 17J percent
for 50’s and 20 percent for carding wools.
The collapse of the “reserve price” operations in New
Zealand brought about a revised and subsidised scheme
in that country, which has resulted in the new season’s
wool flowing more readily to world markets, but, as
yet, there has been no significant reduction in the
large stock-pile of coarse crossbred wools which still
overhangs the market.
In several other industry matters, much still remains
to be ironed out. Container and Unit Load shipping
methods have brought many problems, and changing
views on dumping density requirements have not
helped. '
The original requirement for verv “high density”
dumping has not proved sufficiently acceptable to
overseas buyers. It seems to be the case now that a
half-way compromise of “medium density” dumping
will be generally acceptable.
It is fortunate that agreement has at long last been
reached on something, because, so far as cellular con-
tainer ships are concerned, it can now become a race
against time if the necessary sorting and dumping
facilities are to be available when the new ships
make their initial appearance early in 1969.
The Wool Village concept, presently concentrated
on Sydney, remain’s an unresolved problem for most
Erokers in that centre, for the majority have still not
been able to find any solution to the disposal of their
stores at Pyrmont at anything like reasonable values.
Still to reach finality, also, is the aspect of provision
of the necessary sorting and dumping facilities for
Sydney — a problem which just must be finally resolved
before very long.
Private buying of wool outside the auction system
tended to increase during the past year. The practice
is a disturbing one. Care is taken to roster auction
sale quantities and dates on a regular and planned
basis, in order to co-ordinate offerings in the various
Australian selling centres, so that the wool clip can
be marketed in an orderly manner — an important
ingredient of marketing reform sought by official
Grower organisations, regardless of whether control is
Statutory, non-Statutory, or continues under existing
conditions.
Private buying is under no form of control and can
therefore distort supplies and disposals at times during
the season, with a consequent undermining' effect on
prices, thus tending to offset benefits from the efforts
made to fit auction quantities to market needs pro-
gressively throughout the selling year.
To the general confusion that exists in the Shipping
sphere, there has recently been added the reported
intention of the Federal Government to enter into
National or some other form of shipping participation
in the Australia-Europe trade. More recently, reports
appear to throw doubt on the likelihood of this.
Then too, Russian and Polish ships have made their
appearance with cut freight rates and substantial over-
seas wool-buyer support. This, in turn, must bring
further complications, in that one of the major com-
mitments of any Shipping Conference catering for
Australia’s trade is that it shall provide adequate ton-
nage for all the Country’s imports and exports, and
service all agreed liner cargoes and Ports throughout
the year with its peak and lean seasons.
It is a simple matter for non-Conference or tramp
tonnage to pick the eyes out of the best and easiest-
handled bulk cargoes if and when it suits it, and at
cut freight rates, when it accepts no responsibility for
full service, for all tvpes of exports — refrigerated and
otherwise — throughout the year. The argument is
surely similar to that of admittance of foreign banks
to scoop the cream off Trading Bank earnings without
undertaking the same widespread community facility
and service.
I mention this because, unless order is maintained
in the trade, Conference ships must inevitably carry
less North-bound freight in vessels not fully loaded,
no matter what rationalisation or other steps are taken.
Inevitably this is likely to reflect, subsequently, in
increased freight rates for those of our exports which
cannot be shipped in bulk as wool can be.
This must surely be a matter of real concern to the
Federal Government, but there is, as yet, no indication
of any action on its part, nor any clear display of
concern as to the likely effect on future freight rates.
Some 90 percent of the woolbuying trade are reported
as having contracted with the Conference, but the
extent of Conference loss to the opportunists is likely
to be paid for, in the long run, by our exporters.
CLIENTS
I would like, before concluding, to say “Thank you”
to our Clients, wherever they may be — in all parts of
Australia and overseas.
Throughout the Company, our Staff always aims to
maintain a high level of close, personal and friendly
relationship with our Clients, for whom they strive
constantly to maintain high levels of service of all
kinds carried out in an efficient manner, without
bounds or set hours.

the U.S., the world’s largest manufac-
turer of farm equipment, has not
brought great profits to Waugh and
Josephson yet. The Australian subsidi-
ary, John Deere Ltd., is believed to
rank about fifth in sales volume on the
Australian market for agricultural
.machinery. In its financial year to
October, John Deere converted the 1966
loss of $407,000, to a small profit in
1967 through a big improvement in the
company’s sales position. It is digging
into the Australian market, which is
protected by import duties up to 7|- per-
cent on tractors and on other farm
equipment above 50 percent, by set-
ting up an assembly and manufacturing
plant at Blacktown. It only went into
production in March this year, but the
company’s multi-million-dollar capital
investment is an earnest of its serious
intentions in this market, and Waugh
and Josephson can only benefit. Waugh
and Josephson view John Deere’s move
to increase the local content in its
present range and to ensure an in-
creased flow of products as an oppor-
tunity to be more competitive in the
market than was previously possible.
Considerable expansion, reorganisa-
tion, and preparation work have been
put into developing John Deere sales,
according to Waugh and Josephson.
John Deere has a spare-parts depot at
Mascot, Waugh and Josephson’s is at
Milperra. In 1965, Waugh and Joseph-
son had to import large forward quan-
tities of farming machinery to fit in
with the requirements of Deere’s
American production, and group stocks
for that year rose from $4.8 to $8
million. In 1966, the company declared
that it would be feasible for its farm-
equipment subsidiary to avoid holding
any large quantity of farm machinery
in future. John Deere claims it provides
the best terms of any manufacturer of
any kind in Australia; Waugh and
Josephson enjoy very liberal terms of
settlement with Deeie, having at least
one selling season, and in most cases
two seasons, before payment is due.
Needless to say, Waugh and Joseph-
son’s major money-spinner is the
exclusive dealership in N.S.W. for
Caterpillar of Australia, Pty. Ltd. In
1965 it claimed over 50 percent of the
N.S.W. market for tractors and earth-
moving equipment, and there has prob-
ably been no ground ceded in the
interim. The famous Caterpillar com-
pany sells three times as much earth-
moving equipment throughout the world
as its closest competitor. With branches
and depots in all major centres and
key developing areas in the State,
Waugh and Josephson can service
industry from dam building to cotton
growing and rutile mining.

and engines has application in mining,
materials handling, diesel-electric gener-
ation, road haulage, railways, logging,

undertaken for large contractors and
government bodies. The company’s
turnover rapidly reflects government
financial policy and capital-works
spending on roads, dams, and the like.
Despite the publicity attendant on Mr.
Askin’s appeals to the Federal Govern-
ment for more finance, there is no
evidence of a shrinkage in N.S.W.
public-works expenditure; in fact the

be 28 percent higher in the current year
than last year.
Caterpillar, too, is broadening its
range to cater for the general trend to
mechanisation. Waugh and Josephson
place its orders with the local company,
which may import the goods from
U.S., Scottish, or Japanese plants, or
supply from its Niddrie (Vic.) plant.
Caterpillar profits took a big leap from
$2.6 to $3.6 million in the year to
Septembei-, 1967, and its 1967-68 results
should be reported within the next few
weeks. The parent Caterpillar Tractor
Company took over the fork-lift truck
business of Towmotor in the U.S., so,
from November, 1966, Waugh and
Josephson became the approved Tow-
motor distributor for N.S.W. Though
still small, the company now reports
that this division is operating profitably
in a highly competitive market.

Group accounts of Waugh and
Josephson show a $1.5 million increase
in stocks in 1968 was financed largely
by greater reliance on loan funds, and
by discounted commercial bills to the
extent of $1.2 million. About 20 percent
of the stocks is believed to be in spare
parts, a lucrative business. The com-
pany has come a long way from the
dark days of 1963, when a loss of
$533,000 was registered after a couple
of years of faltering profits. Provided
Waugh and Josephson controls those
all-important items of stocks and
debtors with an iron hand, it should be
able to ride out temporary difficulties
which befall agriculture and industry
from time to time. Its double base gives
it as much security as a heavy equip-
ment dealer can have, vulnerable as
these are to drying up of rural credit
and government spending.

pillar dealer in Victoria and Tasmania,

WM. HAUGHTON & CO. LIMITED
Address delivered by the Chairman, R. F. Sanderson, Esq.,C.B.E., to Sharehold ers at the Annual General Meeting on
29th October, 1968, at 11.30 a.m.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
When I addressed you last year, I stressed your Board’s
concern at the Group’s inadequate past return on funds.
I indicated that our withdrawal from the more com-
petitive and more risky sectors cf the wool trade was
calculated to improve this position. I am now very glad to
tell you that this judgment has so far been vindicated by
events —and, indeed, if it were not that some continuing
losses from unprofitable wool activity, together with
expenses of disengagement therefrom, were borne in the
year under review, our recovery would have been still more
marked.
Yet wool is a staple commodity and will remain so, and
from firm bases in Melbourne, Wellington, London, and
Bradford we continue to operate in those sectors of the
industry which we have selected as either profitable or
promising. Thus the Group’s activity in its traditional field
continues, but with a higher return on funds employed.
One of the most heartening features of the year’s results
was (as indicated in last month’s preliminary report to the
Stock Exchanges) that the rate of improvement was more
than maintained in the second six months; and I can now
add that this trend has already provided us with an
excellent start to the new financial year 1963/69.
This is not to be taken as meaning that profit fluctua-
tions are a thing of the past: any Group engaged, as we
are, in export trade in commodities priced on world
markets, must be prepared for varying earning rates. The
real significance of our new balance of activities is, we
believe, that the fluctuations of the future—and they will
come surely enough—can henceforth be expected to move
in a narrower compass and against the background of
higher average earnings.
Last year shareholders asked a number of questions
about the performance of various specific sectors of the
Group’s activity, and I shall try this year to anticipate at
least some questions by providing more detailed information
in an assimilable form.
I suggest, however, that there is limited value in trying
to assess the real merit or performance of our subsidiaries
by comparing the consolidated figures with those of the
Parent Company. The reason is that in most cases we
endeavour to treat each commodity or trading activity
(spread though it may be through a department of the
Parent Company and one or more subsidiaries) as an
integrated whole. Thus, though management carefully
measures the value of each part of an operation, the
balance sheet figures on their own present only part of the
picture. Some wholly owned subsidiaries, for example, pro-
vide - services or act as feeders to the Parent Company on a
break even basis. I would ask you to bear these general
remarks in mind as I now give a brief review of the
performance of our main interests.
The average price per pound (greasy) realised by
Australian wool in 1967/68, at 41.75 cents, was the lowest
since 1958/59, and this adversely affected earnings, especi-
ally in some country subsidiaries. Prospects for fine and
medium wools now appear sounder, but coarser qualities
(which fell heavily in the first half of the selling season)
remain, as in other countries, a problem.
In New Zealand the Wool Commission finally, in October,
1967, retreated from its policy of buying-in all wool which
failed to reach the reserve, based on a national average of
25 cents per lb. The new policy embraced a two-Ter system,
the buying-in price being reduced to an average of 16.5
cents, whilst growers received a price subsidised to an
average of 25 cents. Supplies thus moved freely again into
international trade, and this liberating effect was backed
by devaluation of the N.Z. dollar. In the result your Com-
pany’s purchases of wool in (New Zealand were satisfactorily
increased over previous years.
Yet a surplus carry-forward of over half a million bales
still remains to be disposed of, and it is to be hoped that
the lesson taught—of what can happen when prices are
fixed at a level out of all relationship with real demand—
has been w.ell digested not only in New Zealand but in
Australia as well.
The Group’s largest subsidiary, Port Phillip Mills Pty.
Ltd., top-makers, made sound progress, though activity was
less buoyant in the second half year. However, a quickening
tempo of plant modernisation gives us confidence for the
future in this competitive field.
The sheepskin department operated very satisfactorily,
surmounting an unusual range of problems, which included
currency crises and political unrest in France — still Aus-
tralia’s major customer for this valuable commodity. It
may not generally be realised that Australia’s exports of
sheepskins in most years reach or exceed 50 million dollars
in value. Record slaughterings of sheep resulted from the
drought in South-Eastern Australia; this augmented
supplies, but made forward planning more difficult.
Conditions in the timber industry were sound but com-
petitive. Depressed prices for framing hardwoods reduced
earnings of milling subsidiaries. Though the timber industry
in Australia has been noted for its fluctuating earnings, I
should like shareholders to know that our experience—and
it covers very many years—has been far from unsatisfactory.
Results from our general merchandising activities were
mixed. In New South Wales and South Australia, where
we sell mainly in rural areas, income was adversely affected
by drought. In Victoria by contrast, where income is less
dependent on country sales, there was a pleasing
improvement.
Our shipping department continued to make a valuable
contribution to profit. During the year the phasing-out of
the U.K. agencies because of containerisation was offset by
increased activity in the Japanese agencies. We have also
been appointed agents for an Indonesian line, but progress
in this direction now depends upon admission of our
principals to the appropriate Conferences.
The Melbourne travel department, operating now in
modernised premises at 54*3 Little Collins Street, continues
to offer an imaginative, efficient, and extremely reliable
world-wide travel service.
I refer you now to the Financial Statements, and I
suggest that as you study them you direct your attention
more to the consolidated figures than to those of the
Parent Company. The consolidated figures, of course,
include the results of the subsidiaries, shares in which
represent a large part of the Parent Company’s investment
in assets.
After extracting what is applicable to minority interests,
the Group showed a net operating profit of $283,773. The
corresponding result for 1966/67 was a net loss of $153,743.
The details of the year’s result are discussed on pages 4
and 5 of the Directors’ Report.
Out of the operating profit for the year, your Directors
have appropriated $112,000 to cover an ordinary dividend
of 8% and $36,000 to cover the usual preference dividend.
After payment of the recommended dividends, and
bringing in the credit balance brought forward at 30th
June. 1967, with minor adjustments for tax, etc., there
remains $394,816 for carry forward at 30th June, 1968, an
increase of $132,396 over the figure shown at the close of
the preceding year.
I shall now outline the important movements in the
Consolidated Balance Sheet, comparing 30th June, 1968,
with the preceding year, figures being rounded to the
nearest thousand dollars.

Preference Dividends (31/10/67 and 30/4/68) 36.000
Sundry Other Items 14,000
TOTAL AS ABOVE $2,019,000
Last year I mentioned that our planned programme of disinvest-
ment from the more vulnerable sections of the wool business had
resulted in a reduction of nearly $2,400,000 in stocks and debtors,
and that that process was continuing. For the year under review,
I now report a further reduction of $1,592,000.
The money derived from the disinvestment in 1908/67 had reduced
bank overdraft by almost $1,200,000 and various other categories
of creditors by about $860,000. In 1967/68 the bank overdraft was
reduced by a further $1,873,000, but an increase of $52,000 was
shown in creditors.
This increase in creditors, particularly after the major reduction
in the previous year, is not of material significance, especially in
the light of the fact which I try to emphasise each year, namely
that in a very fluid export business like ours, the Bank Overdraft
position on any day reflects the combination of the items, Stocks
and Debtors less Creditors, and is principally affected by export
stocks awaiting shipment and clearance of proceeds. The total
amount thus involved can be very large, and can vary markedly
frem day to day.
Nonetheless, the magnitude of the trend shown on a comparison
of the last three balance sheets clearly indicates that our plan of
disinvestment has brought about substantial reductions i-> funds used.
During the year, two properties were sold in the U.K., and we
have several freehold properties in Australia marked down for
disposal at the appropriate time as part of our reorganisation
programme.
The total expenditure (net after sales) on (Properties, Plant and
Equipment, at $98,000, was again considerably lower than the $186,000
which has been provided for depreciation in the accounts of the
year.
Since the end of the financial year your directors have appointed
Messrs. *H. V. James, Australian Timber Manager, and H. F. Roche,
Australian Merchandise Manager, Associate (Directors of the Com-
pany.
The Company’s staff have been unremitting in their efforts, both
in Australia and overseas, and these efforts are reflected in the
improved results. On your behalf I thank them warmly for their
loyal and energetic services.

Although Waugh and Josephson
called a halt this year to recent annual
dividend increments after the 1963
fiasco, further inching up of dividends
could be in order if the twin influences
of the rural sector and Government
spending in N.S.W. are propitious, as
they see ; m to be, this year. The current
ratio does not indicate a less liquid
position calling for a share issue, though
any substantial build-up in stocks could
call for more capital. After the growth
of the ’fifties, shareholders have had no
capital benefits except a note issue in
1960, which converted to share in June,
1966, and lifted capital 45 percent in
one swoop.'

near-neighbors Malaysia, Thailand,
and Indonesia is thought to provide
the Government with a strong incentive
to co-operate with the Council in its
effort to stabilise the market for tin, and
the Department of National Develop-
ment and the Department of Trade are
undertaking an intensive survey of the
local tin-mining industry to provide
the base for Government policy.
The metal, itself, has always been
particularly sensitive to swings in supply
and demand, and for the past year the
price has been maintained only by con-
tinued purchases by the manager of the
“buffer” stock which is operated by the
International Tin Council. Late in
September, the Council members agreed
to limit exports of tin as a second line
support, as the “buffer” pool resources
had been somewhat strained, having had
to absorb some 11,000 tons of metal
worth more than $3O million.
The effects of the recent agreement
have shown up rapidly in the quota-
tions on the London Metal Exchange,
with prices rising from £stg.l29B prior
to the agreement up to a high point
of £stgl394 on November 4. At the
present time, it is highly likely that
Australia will co-operate to some
extent in limiting possible increases in
exports, so it seems unlikely that local
miners will receive much benefit from
the improvement in prices. In addition
to this, the General Services Adminis-
tration stockpile of the United States
Government, which has a considerable
amount of tin, has previously co-
operated with the International Tin
Council in its efforts to support tin-
metal prices by withholding sales unless
prices exceeded £stg.-1234 pre-
devaluation, equivalent to £stg,l4o6 at
present. Should prices continue to rise
this policy would be tested.
Australia, in fact, does not export a
significant amount of tin at the present
time, but prospects are for a continued
increase in production which would
find its way to the export market. Local
requirements of tin metal amount to
some 4500 tons per year, which is
provided by local miners together with
a small quantity of imports. The local
mines produce concentrates containing
some 6000 tons of tin, but not all con-
centrates are smelted locally. For
example, Ardlethan Tin produces a
concentrate which has to be exported
for smelting due to a high level of
impurities (mainly lead) which .the
local smelters are unable to handle.
Last year, exports of concentrates con-
tained 4000 tons of tin metal, but sig-
nificant increases must be expected
when Renison’s expansion program is
operating at full capacity and when
Cleveland Tin achieves full production.
The particular effects of any export
restriction or production restriction on
local companies could be a lot heavier
than the apparently small (2£ percent)
cut in production which the members
of the International Tin Council have
accepted. Much of the increase in
Australian tin production in the past

ADDRESS
few years was basically inspired by the
then very high prices that the metal
was fetching during 1963 and 1965.
These prices encouraged considerably
development in the industry, but
several mines are fairly marginal,
relying on relatively good prices for
profitable operations. To such com-
panies such as Ardlethan and Aber-
foyle and North Australian Uranium
Corporation any hint of controlled
production could well be disastrous, as,
for example, in the case of Ardlethan
the company has achieved its current
level of production only after con-
siderable expenditure on plant, and
future profits would rely on at least the
maintenance of, and possibly an
increase in, ore throughput and con-
centrate production.
The Government would certainly face
some problems in attempting to formu-
late a policy of restricting exports. The
choice seems to lie between a produc-
tion quota based on production in a
base year or a simple restriction of
exports by those companies actually
exporting. Either of these alternatives
would be unjust; the latter in that it
would seriously affect a few companies
(like Ardlethan, which exports all its
production) rather than spreading the
restriction over the whole industry, and
the former in that the past few years
have been ones of considerable fluctua-
tions in production by, say, Tableland
Tin and Renison, while newcomers to
the industry, like Cleveland, have no
history on which any quota could be
properly based. There is, of course, the
possibility that the Government, in
an attempt to avoid any action likely
to dampen the enthusiasm of mineral
prospectors, could undertake to
purchase percent of current exports,
and such a course would not be unduly
expensive, costing, perhaps, some
$375,000 per annum, and gaining con-
siderable international goodwill.

it’s only 50 years ago that Electrolytic
Zinc Company produced the first high
grade zinc in Australia now each
year Australia uses more zinc per head
of population than any other country
in the world. Around twice as much in
fact. In that time E.Z.’s experience,
its attention to product quality and
service, and itsdevelopmentof valuable

Yet, that’s not all. In five years Trade
Credits has doubled shareholders’ funds,
increased net profit threefold, and
boosted earning rate on capital from
18.4 percent to a whopping 35.3 per-
cent. Outstandings at 1968 balance date
were 37 percent up on the previous year,
after provision for doubtful debts and
deferred income, and I am informed a
good growth rate is being maintained
this year.
Present operations are a long way
from Trade Credits’ origins in 1936,
when the board was replaced within
three years. W. G. Parry also joined the
company from lAC, in 1936, and he
has been chief executive since 1940.
Parry and his fellow directors have
used the judgment acquired in the
tough ’thirties to build Trade Credits
into a highly profitable concern.
Up to a decade ago Trade Credits
was a traditional hire-purchase com-
pany, concentrating on motor-vehicle
paper. Then the company moved into
real-estate finance, and this area now
accounts for about 95 percent of out-
standings, with land development,
machinery, and sundry finance making
up the balance. In real estate, about
half the business is bridging finance for
flat, home unit, and commercial
builders, while the other half is in term
mortgages for clients purchasing their
own homes. Bridging finance is a rapidly
developing technique whereby projects
being constructed are financed until
they are completed and sold. This is
the fastest-growing section of Trade
Credit’s business, and it is under good
control. Most clients are introduced by
solicitors, full security is taken, and
repayment is nearly always “on
demand.”
Key factors in Trade Credits’ success
are low overheads, specialised financ-
ing, minimal bad-debt ratio, close
scrutiny of clients, management exper-
tise, and full security. The company
operates solely in the Sydney metropoli-
tan area from one office, and has no
intention of opening branches or going
interstate, in the belief that returns
would not outweigh the higher costs
and looser control required. Total staff
is 15, which means each staff member,
including juniors, accounts for over
$750,000 in outstandings, and that’s a
phenomenal ratio. By staying in special
areas of finance, and having a small

staff, top executives can keep an eye on
every transaction, thus minimising bad
debts. In 1967-68 Trade Credits pro-
vided $75,000 for bad debts, and actu-
ally wrote off only an infinitesimal
fraction. The company’s senior officers
examine each proposition, and obtain
an independent property valuation to
ensure all pertinent facts are available
for a loan decision.
Even when the deal is basically sound,
a detailed investigation is made of the
client’s credit rating. Trade Credits re-
quires two or three referees, a senior
executive conducts an interview, and
the company explores every aspect until
it is satisfied a client can repay. When
this investigation is bracketed with a
security and the fact that all senior
personnel have been with the company
for at least ten years, it is easy to see
why bad debts are so low. There is
no intention of moving into personal
loans as it is contrary to company
policy to lend without security, which
indicates continuing low write-offs in
the future.
Gilt-edged safety in all operations has
made Trade Credits very attractive to
depositors and debenture holders,
although it is fashionable to proclaim
that a finance company can’t survive
without a bank connection. To the ex-
tent that bank-backed companies can
obtain their money cheaper, Trade
Credits is at a disadvantage, but in real
terms the company is competing on a
more equal basis. The latest debenture
issue of $500,000 was placed at pre-
cisely no cost except brokerage, thus
saving between 1.5 and 2 percent in
underwriting and advertising, and bring-
the coupon rate on the funds closer
to that for other companies. A finance
company has really arrived when it can
do business this way.
Trade Credits is geared to take full
advantage of the rapid increase in
finance-company business. The price/
earnings ratio (adjusted for the recent
l-for-4 issue) is 10.4 and seems low in
view of the company’s profitability and
strong current growth. Share prices in
the industry fluctuate constantly, but
at time of writing five companies have
higher ratios. AGC (16.0) heads the
list, followed by CAGA (14.4), Associ-
ated Securities (14.1), FCA (11.8),
and Beneficial (10.5). Close behind is
Custom Credit at 10.0, but Trade
Credits is outperforming them all. At
$1.65 the 50 cent shares are yielding
5.3 percent, and the company looks
the best investment for income and
growth in the finance companies.

BRAMBLES INDUSTRIES LIMITED
Address of the Chairman at the Annual General Meeting
of Brambles Industries Limited held on October 25, 1968
Mr. R. A. DICKSON
Chairman.
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN:
It is again my pleasure to address you at
this our fourteenth Annual General Meet-
ing. At the outset I would like to extend a
very sincere welcome to the new member of
the Board, Sir Cedric Turner, C.B.E. We
are indeed fortunate Sir Cedric accepted an
invitation to join the Board and I am sure
you will agree that with his vast experience
in the extremely important segment of the
Services Industries, namely Aviation, he will
make a most effective contribution to the
progress of your Compan^.
The Accounts for the year ended 30th June,
1968, together with the Reports of the
Directors and Auditors have been in your
hands for some time and with your per-
mission will be taken as read. I now move
the adoption of the Accounts and Reports
of the Directors and the Auditors for the
year ended 30th June, 1968.
This Year's Annual Report: It is appro-
priate that I should comment upon our
decision to change the format of the Annual
Report for 1968. Apart from informing
Stockholders of their Company’s perform-
ance and progress during the immediate
past year of trading the Annual Report is
an important document used extensively by
Management in supporting the business
activities of the different Divisions of the
Company.
In the normal course of business each Divi-
sion of the Company has a requirement for
traditional evidence of the financial strength
and standing of its Parent Company with-
out diverting too much attention from
those particular services that it has to offer.
The organisation of Brambles is such that
each of the eight Divisions has a specific
operating role to perform; a distinct cor-
porate personality to project and a clear
profit objective to achieve. The Annual
Report for 1968 d oes, we believe, appropri-
ately portray the financial strength and
standing of the Brambles Group and will
adequately support the sales promotional
efforts of the various Divisions in their
respective marketing techniques.
Profits: The Group’s performance in the
1967-68 financial year resulted in record
profits being earned. Consolidated profits
after income tax represented 20.1% on
Paid Up Capital. The earning rate on
Shareholder’s Funds was 11% which main-
tained the rate for the previous year. This
is a commendable effort when one takes
into account the fact that Paid Up Capital
was increased by a 1 for 8 cash issue at par
in December, 1967. The six-year comparison
on page 20 of the Annual Report speaks
for itself and reveals the very real progress
that has been made over that period.
The recent increases in public company
rates of income tax announced by the
Federal Treasurer have not been provided
for in the Profit 0C Loss Accounts as pre-
sented. However, the provision for Income
Tax as shown in the Consolidated Balance
Sheet is sufficient to meet the Group’s out-
standing commitment for income tax up to
30th June, 1968.
Growth: The 1967-68 year saw a continua-
tion of the Company’s growth both through
acquisition of other businesses and by the
natural expansion of existing facilities.
Turnover of the Group increased substanti-
ally over the previous year whilst Consoli-
dated Profit before tax was 13.7% higher.
It was the most significant year in the Com-
pany’s history. The Company was successful
in being awarded a number of major long
term contracts, the most important of which
relate to the expansion of its main Divisions
and comprise the following:
(i) 10-year contracts for the digging, load-
ing and haulage of air-cooled and granu-
lated slag at the Kwinana Steelworks in
Western Australia.
(ii) 5-year contract for the haulage of
approximately one million tons of coal
per annum, mostly associated with ex-
port markets, and shipped through Port
Kembla in New South Wales. •
(iii) Substantial participation in haulage con-
tracts associated with natural gas pipe-
line projects in Victoria and Queensland.
(iv) Other long term contracts for the major
movements of heavy raw materials at
the Kwinana Steelworks and for the
cement industry located in Perth, West-
ern Australia.
The results for the period now being reviewed,
of course, gained little benefit from these
contracts which were commenced in the
latter part of the financial year, but it is
anticipated that benefits should be derived
in this and future financial years from these
sources
Since the close of the financial year Brambles
has also been awarded haulage contracts for
delivery of the whole of the steel pipes for
the Adelaide-Moomba Natural Gas Pipeline.
These contracts represent a 15 million ton
mile transport task to be completed within
1 2 months.
The winning by Brambles of so many large
contracts involved further major capital
expenditure in the latter part of the year.
With the recent technical developments of
cargo handling (i.e., containers, cargo trays,
pallet units, etc.) in the international ship-
ping situation now taking place, Brambles
is well organised to participate in the new
type of off-wharf work created by these
changes. Already the various Brambles Trans-
port Divisions are handling certain overseas
cargoes and are planning tp promote addi-
tional facilities to meet the requirements of
other shipping lines.
The Materials Handling Division is also
involved in the changing maritime situation
both at home and abroad. Apart from
embarking upon a programme to increase
the range of its domestic services and facili-
ties, it has also entered into international
licensing arrangements which will enable
Brambles to offer improved material handl-
ing systems.
Acquisitions since Balancing Date:
Since the Annual Report for 1968 went to
press, your Company has made two valuable
additions to its activities.
The first has been the purchase for cash of
Sydney-Newcastle Transport Company Pty.
Ltd., and Sydney-Tamworth Transport Com-
pany Pty. Ltd. Both of these Companies
have operated since 1937 as rail freight
intra-state forwarders in New South Wales
and ihe acquisition of both Companies will
strengthen the intra-state transport activities
of Brambles in that State.
The other successful acquisition was the pur-
chase of the assets connected with the coal
haulage activities of T. F. S. Woods Pty.
Ltd. These activities have been carried on
for some years at Bellambi in the South
Coast area of New South Wales and are
essentially those of an industrial trucking
nature similar to your Company’s other
interests in that district. All coal haulage
contracts previously held by T. Si F. S.
Woods Pty. Ltd. and which had some years
to run have been taken over by Brambles.
Looking Ahead! Brambles is now recog-
nised as a truly national, well diversified
Company under a strong management team.
This, coupled with a consistently improving
profit performance, is reflected in the assess-
ment placed on the Company by the Stock
Market.
In spite of the rising costs of labour and
strong competition the Directors are opti-
mistic about the prospects for the coming
year., I am pleased to report that the Group
profits for the first three months of trading
to 30th September, 1968, are well ahead of
those for the same period last year. In fact,
Ladies and Gentlemen, there is an improve-
ment after Tax of more than $200,000 for
the Quarter.
Staff: Whilst our investment in capital
assets is still increasing each year, so also
is our investment in people increasing both
through training and recruitment.
Stockholders were informed in the Directors’
Report that Share Options would be granted'
to employees. I now advise that on 13th
September, 1968, the Directors granted
306,500 Share Options to 189 senior em-
ployees of the Company. The price at which
these options were granted was $1.67 per
share, being 90% of the market price at
the date of the grants. No further Share
Options will be granted to employees until
the Annual Accounts for 1968-69 are con-
sidered. Full details of Share Options granted
will be included in the next and succeeding
Annual Reports in accordance with the pro-
visions of Section 162 of the Companies
Act, 1961.
It is the belief of the Directors that the issue
of Share Options to Staff gives public
recognition of the importance placed on
the whole Management Team effort within
Brambles and provides a means of linking
the ultimate rewards of capital with those
of labour.
On behalf of the Directors, I would like to
extend our personal thanks to all the Staff
of Brambles for the past year’s result. Our
planned improvement for the current 'year
is a worthy challenge for this very fine Cam
of men and women who face the changes
of our times resolutely and with confidence.
In conclusion, Ladies and Gentlemen, may
I draw your attention to the highlights of
our more recent developments during the
year under review which appear in the pages
attached to the printed copy of my address.
R. A. DICKSON, Chairman.

THE ARTS
AND ENTERTAINMENT
Art with a Prize on its head:
value, suspicion, and debate
By ELWYN LYNN
THE CHEAPEST WAY for country
districts to get an art show is to run a
competition, but the addiction to prizes
in Australia England has but one
important prize; the U.S. is only stirred
every two years by the Pittsburgh Inter-
national prizes must have deeper
sociological roots. Maybe in a country,
where tastes are unformed and where
many know that art is good, but not
what particular specimen of it is good
or bad, people need the assurance of a
ptrize, or maybe they only need a focal
point on which to exercise their
approval or prejudices. Maybe to have
art presented as the result of a bit of a
gamble robs it of too much disconcert-
ing seriousness.
Yet, art prizes do cause aesthetic
debate and sharpen public discrimina-
tion as the public no longer glares at
or swoons before the winner; it inclines
to judge the judges. Prizes have
brought young artists to prominence,
and this seems a much more healthy
way than to have a much publicised
sell-out exhibition, for it increases the
artist’s confidence without emphasising
what sells on the art market. Recently,
John Peart, Syd Ball, Dick Watkins,
and Michael Johnson have come to pro-
minence through art prizes, though it
seems that the public media are less
excited about prizes than they were a
decade ago and it is probably because
established painters do not need the
prestige or money to be had from win-
ning prizes and often feel justly sus-
picious of the taste of judges; the young
artist has much less to lose.
There are about 80 art competitions
and art awards in Australia each year;
the number rises if there is a rash of
municipal centenaries, and 1970 might
see all records broken. N.S.W. offers
about two-thirds of the prizes, with
at least $35,000 in 1967; the other
States vary from year to year, but the
approximate figures are: Victoria,
$8000; Western Australia and Queens-
land, $5OOO each; and Tasmania and
South Australia, $lOOO each. N.S.W.
has about nine prizes of $lOOO and over,
Victoria five of $lOOO and over. There
are, too, Government scholarships in
most States; the most important now-
competitive award is the Britannica
Australia $lO,OOO, which has gone to
William Dobell, Russell Drysdale, Dr.
Ursula Hoff, and Lyndon Dadswell.
The most valuable prize is now the
$5OOO Transfield awarded in open com-
petition, and next year the second high-
est of $4OOO will be promoted by
Victorian tourist interests and the Vic-
torian Racing Club, in the hope that
reproductions of the winning painting
will help tourism; the organisers of this
one have a warning in the retardataire
Gallaher portrait prize that occurred
just once. The Flotta Lauro prizes, one
for sculpture and one for painting, are
estimated at $3OOO each, as they involve
travelling to Italy.
Alan McCulloch’s new “Encyclo-
paedia of Australian Art” selects 22
prestigious prizes, but these could be
limited to 14: the Transfield, Archibald
($1350), Alcorso-Sekers (for sculpture,
$2000), the N.S.W. Contemporary Art
Society (for members, but joining is
easy, $1000), Blake ($1000), Flotta
Lauro, Robin Hood ($400), W. D. and
H. O. Wills (by invitation, $1000), the
Richards (Queensland’s significant prize,
$525), George’s (by invitation, $1500),
Corio ($1000), Mildura (for sculpture
triennially, $750), the Perth Festival
(by invitation, $1000), and Comalco
(sculptors are paid to produce a
maquette by invitation, $3OOO prize).
The most important and best organ-
ised scholarship prize, the Rubinstein
of $l3OO, which was won in turn by
Charles Blackman, Tom Gleghorn, Eric
Smith, Colin Lanceley, Fred Williams,
and Jan Senbergs, was unique in
allowing competitors to show four
works each.
It would be misleading to think that
the $35,000 available each year in
N.S.W. indicates that its artists are
competition-minded: they are blase and
cynical, and only the Rubinstein arouses
N.S.W. passions, whereas in Melbourne,
where prizes are fewer, artists have run
books on the George’s with the invitees
and judges having their form carefully
assessed.
Judges if you leave aside the
increase in size of paintings and the
diminishing space in galleries are
the chief problem. If a judge is used
too often, artists disappointed in one
show are not inclined to send to
another: organisers in, say, Maitland,
might have no idea that their judge
disappointed so many in, say, Ballarat,
and, therefore, the response to their
competition is poor; a judge, as hap-
pened at Newcastle’s NBN Channel 3
prize in October, might fall ill and
a relatively unknown judge be
appointed to select a winner. For this
reason a committee might be prefer-

prize, “Line,” by Tony Coleing
able, for though people think all com-
mittees incline to compromise there is
a lot of debate that soon disposes of
preconceptions and distinguishes
prejudices from preferences, though
there is plenty of horse-trading in the
selection of entries.
Usually organisers follow the local
branch of UNESCO’s -advice and state
the names and qualifications of judges,
but some artists are convinced that
the award tells you more about the
judges’ tastes and prejudices than
about the quality of the work judged.
Some don’t believe in prizes; some, like
Charles Blackman, think they are
simply to help young artists. Kym
Bonython prefers the scholarships based
upon overall achievement to the sudden
fall of manna.
The large prize does provide, how-
ever, surveys that are hard to come
by they hardly occur in Britain at
all and informed observers in the
art world don’t think a new Ueonardo
is on the scene whenever a prize is
awarded; they tend to survey the field
searchingly. Maybe the VRC has
something with that $4OOO promotion.
THE TRANSFIELD —AN
UNFORTUNATE YEAR
By ELWYN LYNN
The Transfield $5OOO. Bonython Gal-
lery, Sydney.
The Kolotex $lOOO. Contemporary Art
Society. Blaxland Gallery, Sydney.
IN THE PAST two years, Transfield
has not been fortunate in the announce-
ment of its judges: in 1967 the substi-
tution of the third judge, appointed
without announcement, upset some


artists; this year, contrary to long-
standing local UNESCO recommenda-
tions, the judges were not announced at
all, but the word was that they were
Donald Brook, R. G. Lansell, and Max
Harris, who is customarily one of the
trio. What did not get around was
that Mr. Harris withdrew. He was not
replaced.
So the selection of entries and the
awarding of $5OOO that no single work
really merited fell to two critics with
individualistic views, who, novices in
the field of judging, might have wel-
comed a third .whose acquaintance with
local art and human foibles was greater
than theirs. Art prizes honor art, award
distinction, and exercise the public’s
discrimination, but on this occasion,
when Transfield has excellent space,
there were so many rejections of artists
of stature that the exercise of such
discrimination has been seriously cur-
tailed. This is especially unfortunate,
as some of the banished include middle-
generation expressionists (only Rapotec
survives) on whom younger critics have
been waging indiscriminate war. As Bob
Hughes is often instanced as a precedent
when young critics are mentioned, let
me note that his strength was incisive
revaluation and not arrogant iconoclasm.
Does anyone seriously believe that
some among the excluded artists like
Sibley (winner, 1962), Feuerring (win-
ner, 1963), Molvig (winner, 1961),
Plate, Paramor, Sali Herman, Lewers,
Clifford, Ostoja, Aspden, Alan, Eric
Smith, Powditch, Guy Grey-Smith,. Old-
field, Daws, or Dallwitz could not have
excelled pieces from Firth-Smith, Jones-
Roberts, Senbergs, Dennis, Mirka Mora,
Clive Moore (a real companion piece
for the prizewinning Peart), Anne
Graham, and Lesley Dumbrell? Art,
even when it’s comic opera, is a serious
business, and neither public nor judges
should be deluded into thinking that all
this is to do with the maintenance of
standards. Artists now will simply
choose their judges more cynically and
more cautiously.
I don’t believe it, but if many of the
banished have suffered a fall from grace
—a notion that implies possible redemp-
tion, though to young critics it’s a sure
sign of the cloven hoof—what of the
descents on show? Robert Hunter is
better when his fugitive forms don’t
fade behind his grey cross; Partos’ 12
modules are deployed with merely fussy
deliberation; Janet Dawson’s shapes are
as trite as suburban sandstone; Dale
Hickey’s tromp I’oeil abstraction has
gone woolly with amorphous shadows;
Clarke has left crusty terrains for vel-
vety comfort; and Bilu, once so full of
the melody of mysterious spheres, illus-
trates pop-art sperm invading a coral
womb . . . yet all these are usually
splendid painters.
The superficial effervescence of the
show goes flat so soon that one is driven
to the unpretentiousness of a handful
of works: badly hung, Rapotec’s piece
of exuberantly melancholy thunder
reveals how : the two-dimensional flat-
ness of a Peart, a Julius Sher’s sweet
trifle of Bacon and Whiteley, and Robin
Wallace-Crabbe’s tame cloud and moon
that have drifted out of Magritte into
a hard-edge work, involves a one-
dimensional spirit. Quality and depth
are maintained in Judy Cassab (her
son, John Kampfner, has some fine,
simple, silhouetted modular wall pieces
in the court), in Reinhard, who has a
shot-gun .marriage between abstraction
and commercialism, in Ron Lambert,
who is as juicily impacted as John
White is lean and tense, in Penglis,
who has some sudden light-created
moire patterns, in Ross Jackson, a new-
comer, who leaps into the middle of
the mainstream, and in Flugelman’s
sand-cast Rosinante, which looks a bit
jaded with it all.
The really memorable work, apart
from Rapotec, comes from flat abstrac-
tions: Michael Johnson, Szabo’, McGil-
lick, and Coburn. Johnson’s imposing,
firm-formed, soft-edged bas-relief of
oblongs at three levels runs the eye up
and down, and side bars keep pushing
the peripheral sight to the centre of
activity; Szabo’s six stripes dash with
vigor, but a little too swiftly, to their
sudden swerve right at the bottom;
John Coburn is not after such empathy
and strives for a quiet, ecstatic glow,
with a central ellipse of black about
purple and grey placed between outer
panels of his former glowing red held
in blue borders; if it surges with power
and glory, McGillick’s seven modules
in seven hues see,m to be in intriguing
indecision whether to sink into the
centre or suddenly career off into space.
The results of this kangaroo court are
on show until November 20. (A Kiwi
potter, Len Castle, upstairs, is mag-
nificent.)
Peart, who recently won two other
prizes and who must satisfy a nostalgia
for Victorian chintz in reaction to the
rigor of hard-edge, shares with Tony
Coleing, awarded the Contemporary
Art Society-Kolotex prize for a tense,
spaghetti-rod sculpture, a penchant for
the trivially frivolous that should not
be dignified with the label of rococo.
Coleing, however, like a lot of the CAS
exhibitors, who are often more interest-
ing than those at Bonython’s, has a
more wayward imagination than Peart,
but for really tough tenseness and a
positive rejection of ambiguous playful-
ness one turns to the Anthony Caro
(about $14,000), imported on loan, with
the help of the British Council, by the
CAS for its 30th anniversary. It should
stay here.
THEATRE/REX CRAMPHORNE
COMFORTABLE CHEKHOV
Uncle Vanya. Chekhov. Independent
Theatre, Sydney.
DORIS FITTON’S production is brisk,
unsubtle, and conventionally 19th
century. This is Chekhov pretty much
as Shaw must have first seen it, wdth the
emphasis on the great harangues, never
on the great silences, with clearly set-
out social problems, a somewhat
ambiguous approach to the seriousness
or humor of the situation, and a text
which draws any conclusions for the
audience, imposing no burdens of inter-
pretation. Needless to say, this is not
at all like the kind of production with
which Stanislavsky revolutionised world
theatre. It is not the kind of production
to make the most of Chekhov’s evoca-
tive understatement, which takes time
and the establishment of. some subtlety
of resonance if the audience is to
register it as anything more than the
flattest of conversational exchanges.
Quoted out of context, or skipped over,
dialogue such as (Serebryakov) “ . . .
ask my mother-in-law and my wife to-
come here . . (Yelena, his wife) “I
am here,” has little significance. In a
good production it is possible for an
audience to recognise that the whole
relationship between the tw'O people is
summed up in this moment of dialogue.
With Chekhov at a zenith of contem-
porary esteem there is a tendency to
Patricia Hill, James Condon , and Alex-
ander Hay in “Uncle Vanya”
look for “atmosphere” and “melan-
choly” of some easy, conventional kind
in his plays. This was never his inten-
tion, and he always insisted, a little
cryptically perhaps, that he had written
comedies, d he Independent production
at least gets this emphasis right, making
scenes such as Vanya’s outburst at the
end of act three a fiasco of violence
which is most amusing and gets the
tone right for act four. But a too-
robustly comic approach can finally
produce as false a treatment as an
over-melancholy one.
Chekhov’s “comedy” is. nearer our
idea of “realism.” The sense of human
impotence in a society desperately in
need of change is the reality in which


the characters move. The play ends
with everyone returning to the “work”
which keeps them going Serebryakov
to his life as an “utter nonentity” in
art criticism, Astrov to vodka and the
medical practice which exhausts him,
and Vanya and Sofya to their drudgery
on the estate. Sofya’s final speech about
endurance in life’s misery and peace in
heaven is bleakly ironical: neither of
them knows how to give life any real
purpose their attempts at love and
hero-worship have failed all that is
left is weary stoicism. This is also
Chekhov’s “comedy” and has nothing
to do with laughing.
But at the same time it has nothing
to do with sentimental affirmations of
human courage the simple note that
this production strikes, with just the
hint of a question at the end. If the
first words of a production of Chekhov
don’t instantly convince us that the
whole iceberg has been charted, and
not just the part above the surface,
then no amount of careful interpreta-
tion of individual speeches can add up
to a real representation of the play.
There is no need to interpret Sofya’s
last speech its meaning is created
by the cumulative effect of what has
gone before.
Chekhov’s comedy lies in facing the
reality of provincial Russian life at the
end of the 19th century: it ought to
strike a contemporary Australian
audience as devastatingly relevant. And
I don’t just mean politically and cul-
turally any one who has lived in,
say, Brisbane or Townsville will recog-
nise the extraordinary accuracy of the
description of lethargy, boredom, and
intellectual inertia in vaguely tropical
terms the map of Africa and
Astrov’s remark about the heat there
brings this running reference to a head
at the very end of the play. The Inde-
pendent audience was mainly glad to
get back to a comfortable sort of pro-
duction with performances that pro-
duced chuckles of recognition and the
unchanging visual impression of a set
of flats on the stage.
Vanya was invested with Alexander
Hay’s customary self-consciousness
which proved to be far more than the
character or play could support. When
Vanya goes out to fetch Yelena a
bunch of hutumn roses, Mr. Hay has
him speak of them as “exquisite and
melancholy” in tones which sneer at
the character’s own romanticism. I
think it very sad that so talented an
actor can look forward to no direction
in Sydney which will coax a difficult
new performance out of him. James
Condon bends Astrov to his personality
with greater success, though, like the
rest of the production, he is too clear-
cut and simplified. Of the women,
Verity Marina does best as Sofya,
Patricia Hill seems to me unsuitably
cast as Yelena, simplifying her responses
to the men, especially to Vanya, to the
point of banality, while Enid Lorimer’s
“maman” is so photographically exact
in physical presence as to make every-
thing else on the stage look like card-
board.
Communicating
PEOPLE PROBLEMS
ONE WAY for Mr. Bob Sanders to
settle the apparently confused circum-
stances surrounding the ABC’s decision
not to renew his TV and radio con-
tract might be for him to submit to a
“People”-type interview. Only last week
he was quoted as saying, “What they
(people) say can be of more value than
what they seem to be,” yet Sanders,
himself, has been much more guarded
about his own situation than he likes
his interview subjects to be.
It might well be that he is justified
in wearing the mantle of martyrdom
that some are tailoring for him, but it
might equally be well worth considering
an apolitical explanation of the affair:
Sanders’ TV audience ratings have been
slipping for more than a year (his pro-
gram’s rating last month was down to
10 in both Sydney and Melbourne — a
fall of 50 percent in less than a year),
and as a $200-plus-a-week employee he
hasn’t seemed to be demonstrating a
capacity to improve what has become,
in the current context of public-affairs
programs, a rather dull and old-
fashioned show.
LONG TIME SEE
BY DINT of their brashness and grand-
standing techniques, certain television
critics in Sydney have succeeded in
opinionating themselves into the same
“personality” category as the people
they write about, but Australia’s most
enduring TV Critic is not among them.
F. C. Kennedy, critic for the w’eekly
“TV Times,” recorded his tenth year
in the job a few months ago, yet most
people, including those in the television
industry, know little more about him
than the smudgily smiling photograph
at the top of his column. He assiduously
avoids Press receptions, his telephone
number is not listed in the directory,
and the magazine is accordingly careful
with it, mainly, he says, because he
doesn’t relish the idea of dealing with
argumentative callers after late-night
showbusiness parties.
The “F.C.,” he admits rather reluct-
antly, stands for Frederick Conlon,
although he’s Ken to his friends, and
he works full-time as a freelance journa-
list from his home in Sydney, writing
general feature material for the U.S.
and local market. He began as. a writer
of short stories shortly after World
War II, before abandoning fiction for
more lucrative work as a journalist.
Except for the time he spent as a staff
writer with the “Daily Mirror,” work-
ing mainly on the newspaper’s daily
historical feature, he has been a free-
lance and had done several radio scripts
when he applied for the job of “TV
Times” television critic.
“At the time, I believed there should
\be someone to ride herd on our pro-
ducers,” he says. “That’s the only ideal-
ism I ever had for the job — I wanted
the column to be read by producers
and people in the industry. It’s pos-
sible for a critic to play only a very
small part in changing viewers’ tastes,
because they’re only affected when they
agree with you. But you can use your
influence on a producer — sometimes
just by laughing him out of a bad idea.
Yes, privately I believe I’ve helped in
small ways to change some things.”
The high spots of his ten-and-a-half
years of viewing have all been British
documentaries, although he believes
Australian production techniques have
reached international standards. “It’s
the writing that hasn’t improved. The
‘Australian Playhouse’ series was disap-
pointing because it gave Australian
scriptwriters an opportunity to test
themselves, and they weren’t able to do
very much with it. Certainly nothing
essentially Australian came out of it.
Television acting hasn’t made much
progress either. Australian actors still
over-act, still feel the presence of the
camera. They act in front of it, while
American and British actors simply
behave.”
He is discouraged by the recent drop
in ATN’s ratings because “it can be
said to have happened because they
gave time to Australian productions.”
Nevertheless, he still thinks the channel’s
“McGooley” series was the best comedy
series done here so far.
He estimates he gives an average of
three hours a day to television, but has
one evening a week free from it. All
premieres are obligatory viewing, and
after ten years of watching television
as a job he'can still switch it on regu-
larly for no other reason that that he
wants to.
FLICKERING ACTION
THE Australian Council for the Arts
has attached another committee in
its pursuit of a new cultural policy for
the nation. With a drama advisory
committee already researching ways
and means of invigorating theatre by
careful subsidy, the council now has
a committee to advise it on filming.
Members are Peter Coleman (chair-
man), Barry Jones and Mrs. Dudley
Erwin — all members of the council —
and film-maker Stefan Sargent, Ian
Jones (of the Crawford organisation),
Stanley Hawes (Commonwealth Film
Unit), and Neil Hutchinson (ABC).
According to its informal terms of
reference, the committee will concern
itself with film material as a basis for
television, not, initially, for the cinema
screen, but it is to give early con-
sideration to the desirability of helping
the establishment of a national film
school.

KNOTTY PROBLEMS
Wait Until Dark. Frederick Knott. St.
Martin’s Theatre, Melbourne.
NEXT TO preparing bibliographies,
writing thrillers must be the most tedi-
ous of literary occupations. Where
writers in other genres can take flight
of fancy or wallow in emotion, the
Frederick Knotts of the world are sub-
ject to almost algebraic disciplines.
Watching “Wait Until Dark,” one
could visualise Mr. Knott busily at
work devising his knotty problems with
slide rule, stopwatch, and furrowed
brow, stifling yawns as he introduced a
motivation here, a mystification there,
or shifted the red herrings about on his
graph-paper. Inevitably, the character-
isation in thrillers are so simplistic
that the stage is peopled by window
dummies who merely model the plot,
while the dramatic devices employed
are usually obvious to the point of.
insult.
Take the case in point. In the inter-
ests of claustrophobia, Mr. Knott sets
his play in a basement flat in Green-
wich Village. His heroine is blind, which
not only makes her poignant but gives
his play a useful theatrical gimmick.
The plot involves her being left to the
mercy of three villains, who are deter-
mined to find a doll full of heroin
that has been hidden in the flat by her
absent husband. Rather than beating
the truth out of her, the gang decides
to use psychological torture to force
her to reveal the doll’s whereabouts,
and this way her blindness adds an
extra dimension of sadism to the pro-
ceedings. It also allows the play to
end with an elaborate game of blind
man’s buff on a darkened stage, and
the curtain falls on a goodly pile of
corpses.
The audience seemed thoroughly at
home with this play. Perhaps because
it reminded them of television? Merci-
fully, producer George Fairfax pre-
vented the cast from employing the
usual grotesque American accents and
everything in his production went like
clockwork —so much so that one quite
expected to see keys turning in the
actors’ backs. However, two cast mem-
bers deserve to be singled out
Raymond Westwell for managing to
invest his stereotype with a maniacal
quality all of his own, and Eileen
Chapman for the brave blind way she
banged into tables and chairs all night.
“Wait Until Dark” comes in the
twilight of a gloomy year for St.
Martin’s. Audiences for the Sydney
production of “Oh What A Lovely
War” have been disappointing, the
theatre’s experiments with more modern
and substantial plays have further
depleted the coffers, and Sir Henry
Bolte rejected their subsidy pleas.
However, there are whispers along the
corridors of power that the submission
may be reconsidered and rumors that
the Arts Council may find it in their
hearts to help out.

MUSIC/KENNETH ROBINS
ON HAND FOR THEIR
BEST INTENTIONS
TWO GENUINELY absorbing con-
certs in a row from the International
Society for Contemporary Music
(Sydney) at the Cell Block is no mean
achievement, and in an area which, let
us face it, contains large pockets of
esoterica which must prove a hurdle to
nearly everyone who is honest and/or
sensitive. Composers who are working
in fields which have not yet achieved
a background of stylistic conventions
are also largely at the mercy of the
performers, and I often wonder how
close to the conceptions of the composer
many premieres are. However, when the
composers are on hand to clear up mis-
conceptions or misunderstandings, and
when the performers are first-rate, we
have the ideal situation which existed
at the Cell Block for the fifth concert
of the ISCM’s 1968 season.
George Dreyfus’ “Quintet, after the
Notebook of J.-G. Noverre” was great
fun throughout. An andante which
released the sensuousness of the bassoon
(its strongest but least known charac-
teristic), an ebullient largo which, in
Mr. Dreyfus’ hands, ceases to be a
contradiction in terms, and a Shosta-
kovichian finale all added up to first-
class entertainment. Here was music
composed of .melody, harmony, disson-
ance, rhythm, and actually written down
in notes. But, despite these reactionary
attributes it remained sparkling and
alive.
Any doubts that the audience may
have had about Nigel Butterley’s ability
to handle secular matters were allayed
by his “Carmina: Four Latin Poems of
Spring”—“The Passing of Winter,”
“The Little Dog,” “The Salmon,” and
“By the River in Spring.” Mr. Butter-
ley’s apotheoses of salmon and saints
are equally cogent, and the performance
by Lauris Elms and the New Sydney
Woodwind Quintet must have made the
composer feel very content, although
there were a few isolated sections which
could possibly benefit from revision, not
of the content but of the balance. Miss
Elms, as was to be expected, handled
some awkward stuff with remarkable
expertise, which, however, did not fully
hide a touch of anxiety at times.
Without any intention of playing
down the significant contribution of
the Dreyfus and the Butterley works to
the program and, indeed, to the cause
of Australian music in general, the
most intriguing piece was “Tabuh-
Tabuhan, for Wind Quintet and Per-
cussion,” by Peter Sculthorpe. The
exotic blandishments of the Orient have
for some time been a strong influence
in the music of Sculthorpe, and in this
work he has renounced any effort to
pass as white. For the time being, evo-
cations of our timeless land, so much
a part of the “Sixth Quartet,” would
seem to hold little charm for him and
it must be admitted that his chrrent
love is productive of music that is
beguiling and fascinating.
The genesis of “Tabuh-Tabuhan”
was in a poem by a Balinese boy about
his dream of taking his girlfriend to
the major and most exclusive hotel on
the island. In this five-movement work
the even-numbered movements are
sound experiments beloved of the com-
poser and vastly amusing. Pillows from
Java and, if I am not mistaken, bed-
springs from Sheffield are among the
delights pictured. However, it is in the
first, third, and fifth movements that the
work makes its genuinely musical im-
pact, for as a translation of the spirit
and much of the letter of the Balinese
gamelan it is a remarkable tour de force.

PORTER'S JAPAN:
PREMONITIONS
IN PURGATORY
By ROBERT RAYMOND
The Actors: An Image of the New
Japan. Hal Porter. Angus and Rob-
ertson. $5.25.
THERE SEEMS today in Australia,
if not in the wider West a vaguely
uncertain preoccupation with the
growing presence of Japan. Supple-
ments proliferate in newspapers and
travel pages drip with cherry blossom;
financial writers . warn of trade
imbalances and the dangers of a new
economic colonialism; some commenta-
tors, on the other hand, are already
hopefully constructing a new defence
triangle, consisting of Japan, Australia,
and India, to take the strain in South-
East Asia.
There are, however, surprisingly few
books being written about Japan; per-
haps this is because it is so difficult. It
is even difficult, as I have found, to
make a thing as apparently simple and
superficial as a television report cn the
place. Where do you point the camera
in such a confused and confusing land-
scape? What do you select from this
incredible jumble-stall of instant history,
synthetic culture, and plastic reality?
Hal Porter’s book “The Actors”
comes, then, to this reviewer at least,
like a flash of recognition, brighter than
a thousand suns. Flere, all one’s groping
and half-caught sensations about the
place and the people are suddenly
transfixed on the blade of Porter’s in-
sight—which he drives brutally through
the painted mask of the “new” Japan.
As an account of his travels, it is
intensely revealing of the man himself,
because it did not start out to be what
it has become: a confession of a pro-
found disillusionment of a lifetime’s
spell. What eventually became almost
an obsession began when he was five,
when Japan presented itself to him as
“a tumbler of water into which were
dropped slivers of compressed and
dehydrated pith. These, immediately
and entrancingly, began expanding and
uncurling into flowers, birds, unidentifi-
able shapes in indigos and emerald-
greens and crimsons, colors of an
intensity I had not seen before.”
The injections continued, chiefly
through books, until he spent two years,
1949 and 1950, as schoolmaster to the
children of Australian occupation
troops in Japan. During this time he
travelled widely and freely, with the
conqueror’s privilege of access to places
normally out of bounds to the gaijin
(foreigner).
He confesses that after that he be-
came an addict, his writings increas-
ingly extolling the Japanese, while
denigrating Westerners as hairy bar-
barians grunting in a slough. Finally,
it became necessary to walk away from
the past and find out about the present;
to test the convictions that had arranged
themselves in quartz shapes in his mind.
A cultural-relationships project to
lecture at a number of important Jap-
anese universities provided the oppor-
tunity for an extended visit last year.
The story of his pilgrimage to the
places he knew (or thought he knew)
is told in glittering, sometimes over-
ripe, passages of description, erupting
quite frequently with bouts of scarifying
venom. Porter’s theme is that the
Japanese are actors, “a nation of
actors so competent that that they can
victimise not only each other but them-
selves ... all the frayed and blood-
stiffened threads of a past of ritual in-
solences and hypocrisies, all the threads
borrowed from superior cultures and re-
dyed with a skilled wilfulness, all the
threads of their personal confusions and
vanities, they weave together into a
complex fabric, a public costume
theatrically shimmering but trumpery
as mungo. They have acted themselves
into the trilemma of being not what
they are, not what they seem to be, but
what they seem to themselves to be.”
Certainly their past performance
fooled me, he seems to say but no
longer. And the bitterness of his dis-
illusionment makes his diatribe as
horribly fascinating as he makes out
Japan to be.
He starts with Tokyo: “Groaning,
shrieking, roaring, clashing, squealing,
and thundering like a satanic factory,
Tokyo offers at the wailing wall of
civilisation its ululation for an out-
rageous mating between humanity and
eternity ... as though to add dimen-
sion and volume to uproar by illustra-
ting it, the sparklings of oxywelding
flares, spiked and blue as agony, burst
out high as snow on the girder-and-
cement precipices of mounting depart-
ment stores, banks, theatres, hotels,
and office blocks . . . with a revolution
of unholy expectations in progress,
Tokyo is an allegory to warn, a City
of Dreadful Day, where post-1984
robotism and the superstitions of pre-
historic animism are inextricably
braided together ... a people clawing
a way downward, upward, in all direc-
tions in search of the extra life
imagined to exist at the heart of over-
whelming and humiliating calamity.
They have transformed themselves into
their own flail and grain, and their
city is their threshing floor.”
All across the nation, Porter himself
flails and threshes in a fury of ex-
ploded illusions. Japanese houses are
kept “as aridly speckless as the inside
of a basket with nothing in it. The
traditional scorn of display is partly
a fiction to hide the fact that there is
very little to display.” Outside is dif-
ferent, he says, a place for “compulsive
contamination ... a non-place to be
spat on, an unpossessed realm to be
defiled by orange peel, pear cores,
loquat seeds, homogenised milk car-
tons, lunch boxes, newspapers, cellulose
paper sachets that once held ginkgo
seeds or popcorn, anything at all
rejectable.”
Beauty, form, design? “If one does
believe the propaganda that the
Japanese, as a race, are gifted above all
other races with a special sensitivity to
beauty, one must nevertheless say that
they have the world’s most highly de-
veloped insensitivity to downright
ugliness.”
Those charming doll-like Japanese
children? “On the whole they seem
much as they did—spoiled (the boys
particularly), secretive but not shy,
consciously charming, deliberately
“boyish” or “girlish,” with a sort of
steel-spring-motivated garrulousness and
vivacity like that of mechanical birds
. . . Japanese children, like Japanese
students, are told; they do not ask, and
they are not asked ... a voice in-
sidiously suggests that individualism is
perfidious, that pitilessness to others is
a severe necessity, that life is harsher
and more demanding than death.”
Watching and talking to the anim-
mated young people of Japan, Porter
discovers that “the high spirits are
faked, an exhibitionist trick, and that
they fret at being robbed of the aestheic
advantages of personal freedom by the
material advantages of national accom-
plishment.”
His picture of Japan is vivid ancT
feverish, like Japan itself: “Sunsets flare
up as though instantaneous combustion
has ignited the rubbish of euphemisms,,
duplicities, neuroses, and malices piled
up during the day, a mountain range
of cast-offs smouldering beyond the
horizon . . . from the canal bridges one
can see, in room after room, the mouths
of all the television tunnels open on the
electric-blue purgatory beyond . . .”
From the empty life of the geishas
to the commercially induced fascination
of Japanese children with monsters,
Porter surveys the performance being
played out by a hundred-million actors,,
and finds the place “an infernal carni-
val of sideshows that never close down,
an orchestra that never lets up, a con-
voluted and macabre comedy without
an interval, a stage setting never with-
out actors.”
It is when he begins to seek the-
object of all this frenetic activity that
the disturbing premonitions begin to-
seep into one’s comfortable sense of
spectatorship.
As clearly as he knows how, and"
certainly more convincingly than any
other writer on modern Japan, Hal
Porter says that the fuel that charges
the powerhouse of Japanese revival is
hatred of the gaijin, and especially the
white gaijin; that when the first Ameri-
can, a Captain Buchanan, stepped
ashore on July Bth, 1853, “on to the
sacred soil, unpolluted by barbarian
soles for over two centuries . . . from
the thousands of samurai throats came
a long deep growling. This sustained
groan of rage and mourning still
reverberates though the cryptic galleries
of the Japanese mind. The reverbera-
tions cannot always remain unheard.

The inner rage explodes from its con-
fines and the world hears.”
Seeing the thousands who stand
silently outside the Emperor’s palace
in Tokyo, Porter finds their very
immobility appalling: “In what is not
done and not said by these patient
actors is to be detected the unquenched
spot, the ever-smouldering point of

BRAINE'S UN-EDEN

HERE IS AN ugly tale of ugly people
in an ugly, modern big city, which
happens to be London. Mr. Braine has
left his former heroes and adversaries
kicking one another around at The
Top to study a clutch of young pro-
vincials in “swinging London,” which
seems to give them total opportunity
to throttle most of their better human
impulses until they are as alienated from
ideals as the streets are from nature.
Salim Pat ell’s apt jacket design
Man’s alienation is the name of “The
Crying Game.”
That’s how I read it. Some novels
make the author’s intention clear, some
mask his thought, leaving it for the
reviewers’ guessing games. And the
more the reviewers differ, the, more
kinds of people are likely to take a
punt on the book. On the surface, this
is a tawdry tale of young bourgeois
conservatives making room for them-
selves at the middle, cursing a post-
Wilson Labor Government, mad with
the sex, and, in their own elegant
language, “poking everything that
moves.” That most of them in Braine’s
focus are provincial Roman Catholics
adds little dramatic interest to their
lives because they are too young and

feckless to suffer more than faint
twinges of conscience. An occasional
Prayer of Contrition on rising from a
new bed fixes everything.
At that level, the book offers mar-
vellous value for the prurient and
word-of-mouth publicity will sell it in
tens of thousands. Good luck to the
author; particularly when, I suspect,
his end game is morality. And not just
the conventional morality of the
women’s magazine, with the shabby hero
finally opting for love and marriage,
suburbia, and kids. Something more
than that. Where Muggeridge, for in-
stance, protests and sneers at the per-
missive society, and is taken as more
and more of a joke, Braine could be
beguiling it to swallow its own sick,
and be sicker; object, reform.
The storyline resembles that used by
Morris Lurie, reviewed here a month
ago; the first-person narrator is a
journalist who exists in a bed-sitter, and
who tells of the life of a better-housed
friend; but Lurie’s fun in the telling
does not suit Braine’s grimmer purpose.
In his mirror there is nothing to laugh
at unless you find purgatory humorous.
Batcombe, a real as distinct from a
fictional journalist, is set to helping
his paper get the dirt on a novelist
female who is involved with a Cabinet
Minister its faceless proprietor wants
to destroy. Finally, he jockeys them
together at a Hampstead party long
enough to be photographed and pinned
in an innuendo-laden but not actionable
story which will link them in the public
mind in time for the big story when
the husband sues for divorce.
Then Batcombe finds himself smartly
betrayed by everyone, including fiancee
Angela, the Cabinet Minister escapes
with his snow-white fleece intact, every-
one seems to escape but cousin Adam
Keelby, PR man ordinaire, who con-
cludes, “These things pass ... I thought
I’d never get over Wendy leaving me
for Angela, but when I saw Angela
again I was glad to see her . . . Christ,
I’m tired.” And soon his mouth fell
open and he began to snore, as he would
in the same room, ten, 20, 30 years
from then.
They’re an unlovely lot, the Frank
Batcombes, Adam Keelbys, Theresa
Cardonaghs, “Lizzies” like Angela, and
on through the large cast of half-people.
Particularly when he records their rabid
illiberalism, their stale jokes about
mating various progs (progressive) with
one another, their knee-deep shallow-
ness, and then contrasts them with
their old-virtues parents, does Braine
seem to inject a morality to be sub-
limally absorbed by his readers. If that’s
what he’s about, then he may be
effective.
And, if not in that way, at least in
another: in getting people to read novels
at all. While stylish critics talk of novel
writing as “participating in the great
debate,” the hall is emptying, every-
one is going home to watch the tele.
Worst of all, no one on the platform
seems to know what to do about it.

YOUNG READERS' NEEDS?
By DENYS BURROWS
Topliners (various titles). E. W.
Hildick. Joan Tate. Ray Pope. R.
Maddock. Macmillan. 55c each.
AMONG LIBRARIANS and teachers
there appears to be a growing aware-
ness that many average children fail
to discover the excitement of reading
because there is a dearth of stories
suited to their intelligence. High levels
of imagination in both writing and
art work tends to leave such children
confused, and thereafter their interest
soon wanes. Librarians speak of the
need for books written for the average
child and the backward reader.
In creating the “Topliners” series,
Macmillans have made an attempt to
meet this need of the juvenile reader.
Produced in paperback, each with a
colorful cover, these short novels range
in length between 25,000-30*000 words.
The themes are earthy, the prose is
direct and frequently colloquial in
style. There is no attempt to present
an idealistic picture of life; most are
tales of very ordinary people.
The stories vary. “The Dragon in the
Garden” introduces Stewart, a boy who
has been educated by his parents until
the age of 13, when he attends
school for the first time. School disci-
pline is difficult to accept, and he is
faced by unpleasant encounters with a
bullying gang led by Fagso, who runs
a protection racket. There are some
hard lessons to be faced, but finally,
with the aid of judo lessons given by
his scluptor father and the backing of
a rival gang, Stewart is able to out-
face his enemies.
“Louie’s Lot” tells of Tim Shaw’s
attempt to join a band of boys who
help the head roundsman (milkman)
of the New Day Dairy Company. Only
the best can pass Louie’s strict selection
tests, and some of those who fail be-
come enemies of the chosen few. Tim
learns what it means to hold a job, to
please customers, and deal with
trouble-makers. This story uses various
techniques intended to assist the slow
reader but whieh achieves a school
textbook quality likely to defeat their
purpose.
“Sam and Me,” written for an older
age group, deals with the problems of
an adopted girl growing to adulthood.
Her first encounters with love and
marriage, including the demands made
upon the woman during marital sex,
are frankly treated perhaps too
frankly for some young readers who
may lack discernment.
Other titles in the series include “The
Drum,” a story of young people strug-
gling to keep alive among the ruins of
a war-damaged town, and “String of
Time,” a somewhat unconvincing tale of
a girl who accidentally passes through
a time warp and becomes involved with
a demoniac creature from the past. In
all cases, the aim is primarily to tell
an entertaining story.
Children on whom these Topliners
were tested voted them “great” with
various degrees of enthusiasm. There
can be little doubt that the books were
found easy to read. However, there is a
strong atmosphere of the English work-
ing-class in these stories; the language
and attitudes are those of the Midlands,
and undoubtedly they were written with
such markets in mind. The young Aus-
tralian reader will find little that is
reminiscent of his own background. Yet
there is a lack of stuffiness and of
artistic self-consciousness (some will say
a lack of artistic standards) which may
well prove of real importance if a last-
ing contact is to be made with the
vast middle ground of youngsters ripe
to discover the excitement of reading.
Perhaps the time is opportune for
such ventures by local publishers. The
reaction of young readers to books in
the Topliner series indicates that there
could be a need for stories set in every-
day Australian situations and written
without pretensions to high literary
standards. The question arises whether it
is desirable for large numbers of the
young to enjoy reading; or should a
more select number be induced to read
only books of merit?
SENSE OF PROPORTION
By DONALD GAZZARD
Architecture in Australia: a history.
J. M. Freeland. F. W. Cheshire Pub-
lishing Pty. Ltd. $9.95.
AT LAST a broad, sweeping account
of the development of Architecture in
Ozland, and a remarkably satisfying
one, too. Professor Freeland’s latest
book is not a conventional history of
Capital A Architecture, and ranges
widely over innovations in building
materials, vernacular architecture
(farmhouses, .mill buildings, and such
like, just put up, as distinct from rather
consciously built edifices such as Town
Halls), and returns continually as a
touchstone to the ordinary house.
Sensibly designed and well illustrated
with over over 230 photographs (not all
of which have fared so well with the
Hong Kong litho printing), the photo-
graphs have been chosen with wit,
originality, and freshness. All of the
buildings photographed, with one or two
exceptions, are still standing, and the
addresses are given alongside the photo-
graphs.
All this gives the book a common-
sense air that is very refreshing. The
architecture built in this country over
the past 180 years has had its moments,
but it was certainly not a belle epoque
(here or anywhere else), and we should
not lose our sense of proportion about
it.
Although the text unfolds chronologi-
cally and is interwoven with the politi-
cal and social development of Australia,
the book is clearly intended primarily
for Australian readers, as it rather takes
for granted some background knowledge
and understanding.

side world are mentioned in passing,
but Professor Freeland has made only
a cursory attempt to relate these to the
local scene or to compare or evaluate
Australian buildings with their contem-
poraries overseas.
It is rather a pity that this aspect is
not stressed a little more. How do our
Victorian buildings, for example, com-
pare with High Victorian buildings in
England, the U.S., and elsewhere? Mind
you, this could be a pretty sterile aca-
demic exercise, but there should be
some points of reference. I find it frus-
trating that St. John’s Cathedral in
Brisbane, one of the two or three of our
Victorian buildings that rate a mention
in Henry Russell-Hitchcock’s monu-
mental and authoritative world view
“Architecture 19th and 20th Century”
(and the only one to get a plate), is
not mentioned in Professor Freeland’s
book; one wonders why Hitchcock
included it and, correspondingly, why
Freeland did not.
But if this is not a book for the
specialist historian or architect, it is
definitely a book that everyone will find
illuminating in so,me different way,
depending on his background. It gives
a very good, broad picture of our archi-
tectural history (Professor Freeland
bravely commits himself right up to
the present day) and would, I am sure,
encourage any reader to look around
with new eyes.
VICARIOUS NOSTALGIA
By DONALD YOUNG
The Restless Years. Book and LP
record. Peter O’Shaughnessy, Graeme
Inson, Russel Ward. Jacaranda Press.
$l2.
I WOULD not recommend this
ensemble of coffee-table book, 12-inch
LP record, and presentation slip-case
to any Australian who was influenced
by a grandfather who was influenced
by his grandmother, who was born in
Sydney in 1800. Like me, such an Aus-
tralian would probably have his own
personal and accidental view of what
it might once have meant to have
been an Australian, and he might be
offended by the failure of this book
and its LP record simply to duplicate
that view. That leaves almost everyone
else, however, and I would recommend
the book to almost anyone else who
wants to have a roll in a vicarious
nostalgia at the price of $l2 a roll,
which, given the handsomeness of the
book and its slip-case and the quality
of the 12-inch LP, seems a fair price.
In fact, if I weren’t getting the whole
ensemble for nothing, because I am
reviewing it, I might have bought it
anyway, so that I could take it home
to my children (who haven’t got a
grandfather) and let them look at the
book and hear the record, and then,
perhaps, themselves acquire some
nostalgia for our past even if it is


in the form of the chi-chi nostalgia of
the present.
Marx said that history plays itself
twice over, the first time as tragedy
and the second time as farce. Someone
might now add that a replay of a
revived nostalgia is always chi-chi.
Llowever, it is not to criticise the con-
fectors of this ensemble to say that it is
chi-chi, but to praise them. It is a
re-run of the 1890 s nationalist view of
Australia, believable then, fundamen-
tally unbelievable now but why not?
Other nations romanticise their past
selectively. Why shouldn’t we do so,
too? When Russel Ward wrote his “The
Australian Legend” he was careful to
point out that it was the envelopment
of a legend he was describing, not
necessarily what happened. This
ensemble can best be considered as the
sights and sounds of the legend Mr.
Ward described in words. Some of the
pictures may be a little over-green in
their printing (perhaps they overesti-
mate the Irish influence in Australia in
the printing houses of Hong Kong), but
they evoke the legend splendidly, as do
the songs in the LP. And, apart from
the quick introductions to each chapter,
the text consists of contemporary quotes
done so effectively that they remind
me of the old yellowed clippings of
things that had once interested him
that I used to see pasted in my grand-
father’s toolbox.
That the snippets are about convicts,
new chums, explorers, gold diggers, and
bushrangers and not about suburbanites,
temperance reformers, Empire loyalists,
RSL club managers, and municipal
mayors is, of course, an impressive
weakness, if one looked at it as history.
But how can we be nostalgic about
suburbanites or RSL club managers
when they are still with us, and still of
relevance to Australia?

Cookbook
BARBECUES FOR
IGLOO-DWELLERS,
AND OTHERS
I HAVE never been to Japan, but to
look around the gadgets in our house
you’d think I was personally endeavor-
ing to make up for our imbalance of
trade with the Japanese. And we have
just made another investment.
Long ago, I fell in love with a Jap-
anese cooking device called a “Kam-
ado.” It’s like' an oversized ceramic
cooking pot containing a grill, and
topped with a domed, hinged lid with
a chimney. The “Kamado” comes in
three sizes; the largest stands nearly
3ft. high, with a grill diameter of about
24in.—big enough to hold about a
dozen steaks.
I had been quietly laying my strategy
in a feminine manner; just dropping a
hint here and there, you understand.
In fact, the hints began last year, when
some friends made a similar investment.
My husband had seen it in operation
and, being both gadget- and food-
minded, like most men, he had fallen
for it. With the first rays of summer,
I sent him out to buy a barbecue of
some kind, and left the choice to him.
He came home full of reasons why the
medium “Kamado” was a good buy at
$29. So far he has had no reason to
regret it; in fact he is having enormous
fun.
I would say that for anyone with
any kind of garden at all, or even a
home-unit with a balcony, nothing
could be better. (The directions assure
us that this barbecue can even be used
inside the house but as there is still
some smoke from the cooking process,
if not the charcoal itself, I would
recommend this only for igloos.)
It is certainly much cleaner to use
than other barbecues, and looks most
decorative (ours is orange!). The thick
clay walls retain nearly 90 percent of
the heat produced by the charcoal, con-
sequently a double handful of fuel
will cook for a whole party.
The interior of a “Kamado” is much
hotter than ordinary barbecues and,
the heat being reflected downward from
the clay lid, it cooks top and bottom
at the same time, and hence much
more evenly and quickly. We find that
we can easily cook for up to 16 people,
and serve sizzling food to all in the
space of about ten minutes.
For “Kamado” parties, we serve a
mixed cold hors-d’oeuvre from platters
as a starter. This keeps people interested
in eating until the main course is in
front of every one of them.
I prepare artichokes vinaigrette with
finely chopped parsley. Radishes
snipped into roses. Asparagus with
mayonnaise. Smoked salmon with lemon
slivers. Avocado slices steeped in a red
wine vinegar brew. Sliced sausages,
gherkins, and anything I can lay my
hands on in the larder. Lots of crisp
and buttery garlic bread for mopping-
up operations.
At the moment, we are rather mad
about pork spareribs. After numerous
experiments, here is the recipe that
proved most successful.
Allow half a pound of spareribs per
person and get your butcher to prepare
them properly: skin them, remove spare
fat, and cut diagonally across the bones.
(I have got my butcher to cut them
across instead of with the bone because
I prefer it. So, I have discovered, do
my guests. But you need to eat them
with a knife and fork in this case;
with your fingers if you leave the
bones whole.)
A dry marinade is prepared and
rubbed well into the meat. For 41b. of
meat mix Jib. of brown sugar, a level
tablespoon of celery seeds, a , level
tablespoon of chilli powder, a teaspoon
of sweet paprika, a tablespoon of salt,
and 2 crushed cloves of garlic.
I have used varying strengths of
chilli powder. Personally, I like my
mixture hotter than the average person.
In fact, on one occasion I used Indian
chilli and, through their my pro-
testing guests still maintained that it
was nice. But I suggest you use a
milder form unless you like very hot
food, too.
If you are leaving the spareribs over-
night, remember to turn them once in a
while and, on rising in the morning,
add half a cup of red wine vinegar.
Turn again from time to time before-
using.
If you are preparing the meat in the
morning, then leave the sugar mixture
on for at least two hours before adding
the vinegar—and again leave at least
two hours before using.
This, in my opinion, must be served
with jacket potatoes (baked in the oven
in your kitchen), split and topped with
sour cream and chives. The spicy flavor
of the meat calls for something soothing
like the sour cream. A tossed salad is
another essential.
I also like to serve a plain tomato
salad and, separately, a capsicum salad.
To make this, cut the stems arid the
seeds out of as many capsicums, both
red and green, as you can muster.
Slice in rings and fry lightly with a
clove of garlic in butter until softened.
Drain briefly on kitchen paper, put
into a bowl and top, while still watm,
with enough sour cream to blerid. Dust
with freshly ground black pepper and
some salt, and sprinkle with paprika
when mixed.
A saddle of lamb is also good cooked
in the “Kamado” (or on any barbecue).
Rub the saddle with a damp cloth:
Chop 2 cloves of garlic finely and some
fresh rosemary, and blend with 4 table-
spoons of olive oil, 4 tablespoons of
soy sauce, a small glass of dry wine,
the juice of 1 lemon, a tablespoon of
salt, and some freshly ground black-
pepper. Rub this mixture well into
your lamb and leave for at least two
hours. Barbecue for 15 minutes per
pound, and baste with remaining
marinade from time to time while
roasting.
The meat will be pink and still rare,
which is how I like it. But if you like
it well cooked, then cook 20 to 25
minutes per pound. This is good with
a rice salad or baked potatoes, plus a
green salad.
Even fish is good on a barbecue. So,
if you have a fisherman in the house
who comes home with something large
and firm, scale and clean the beast
and stuff it with herbs: rosemary, bay-
leaves, fennel, and dill. Salt and
pepper to taste. Place on foil, dot with
butter, and add a good glass of white
wine and the juice of 1 lemon. Close
the foil and place on the barbecue.
Turn once before checking, without
opening, to see whether the fish has
cooked through. Test with a fork; if
it penetrates easily to the backbones,
it’s done.
Serve with plenty of melted butter
flavored with lemon juice and finely
chopped tarragon.
And remember, with a “Kamado”
you can still cook in pouring rain!

"Everyman" in New Guinea
Mr. Tasker’s enthusiasm (8., Oct. 26)
over indigenous representation in the
Papua/New Guinea Drama Festival is
much appreciated. As producer of
“Everyrhan,” I adapted the script from
Obotunde Ijimere’s version of the
medieval play. Ijimere conceived his
“Everyman” fully within the framework
of the reincarnation myths of Western
Nigeria.
My original intention in rewriting
the script for use in Papua and New
Guinea was to transpose the play into
magico-religious terms intelligible to
indigenous performers. It seemed,
though, that such terms would require
an enormous pantheon of spirits, and
the Christian Missions have done their
work too well.
When Mr. Tasker writes of the in-
digenous audience sensing a unity as the
“decadent Everyman” is sought by the
“ancient God,” he is wrong. For most
New Guineans this was the God of the
Christians in another guise; for most
it also aroused > acute embarrassment,
since we, in our wisdom, have sought
for years to stamp out beliefs and
customs associated with the ceremonies
for which this magnificent costume was
created.
The New Guineans will not lament
the passing of the costumes and the cere-
mony which have made this island
famous, but a small group of aliens
are aware of the Melanesian culture
and are endeavoring to revive and
sustain elements of it through dramatic
presentation.
Music was a major difficulty in the
preparation of “Everyman.” Vigorous,
lighthearted local music does not exist.
The great, resounding drums have given
way to the transistor radio, wailing out
the products of today’s pop groups.
There has been no compromise, nor
will there be. Tribal dancing is occa-
sionally performed for display or enter-
tainment but, for enjoyment, college
students would not consider moving
away from the Twist, Frug, Shake, etc.
No theatre will emerge from “villages
and townships” because all Papua and
New Guinea theatre must be European-
inspired, and, therefore, founded in
educational institutions.
After ten years’ close contact with
Papua and New Guinea students, I
regrettably conclude that in the future,
without , the influence, organisation, and
inspiration of expatriates, participation
in theatre by the indigenous people of
Papua and New Guinea will cease.
Alan Hannan
Madang, New Guinea
On behalf of the cast of “Everyman” I
wish to thank Mr. Tasker for the praise
given to our effort in Port Moresby.
However, it was disappointing to us
that Mr. Tasker did not acknowledge
the work of two Australian lecturers
at our college who made “Everyman”
a success; Annette Hooper, for her
enormous contribution in designing and
preparing most of the costumes for the
play, and Alan Hannan, who first saw
“Everyman” in terms of Papua and
New Guinea ideas and expressions. He
made us work hard for months with
“Everyman,” but now we see the re-
ward for this enterprise.

Australian nationalism
I believe Mr. Patrick Morgan (8.,
Nov. 2, “Waiting for the Start”) is
quite correct. And so was Mr. Gorton,
when he said, “We live in the most
exciting times this country has known.”
However, very few Australians feel
any guilt for the deaths of a million
Jews, who could have migrated from
Europe’s death camps before and dur-
ing World War 11. This was, of course,
an acid test of Australian nationalism.
The first true Australians are des-
cribed in Patsy Adam Smith’s book
“Moonbird People.”
They were a mixture of Europeans
and Asians who survived in a purely
Australian environment. Many people
have adopted THEIR nationalism
which makes us aware that to survive
in a purely Australian society we
should now accept a million refugees
from Vietnam.

USS New Jersey
Your article about USS New Jersey
from the San Francisco “Chronicle”
(8., Oct. 10) was not only ill-informed
but a rash generalisation of the effec-
tiveness of a battleship in the role
against North Vietnam, made on the
basis of a single action. The reason
the New Jersey was brought back into
service was twofold:
(a) Because of the range of her
guns she can engage many targets
within North Vietnam without coming
in range of shore batteries, thus
eliminating the risks now run by U.S.N.
and Australian destroyers.
(b) She can engage a very large
proportion of the targets in North
Vietnam which were being bombed by
carrier-borne strike aircraft vulnerable
to surface-to-air missile attack.
Surely the cost of $2B million to
bring her back into service is worth
while if she can save just one DDG
such as Perth or Hobart (cost $45
million) being sunk, or seven Phantom
or Intruder aircraft (cost approx.
$4 million each) being shot down.
