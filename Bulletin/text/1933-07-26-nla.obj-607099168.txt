Two Views of a Dogfight
Arthur Mailey’s And Then Came Lar-
wood. (Bodley Head; 55.) and Jar dine
Justified, by Bruce Harris (Chapman and
Hall; 65.), are- concerned chiefly with
bodylining. Mailey’s is much the better
book; he has humor and a racy style,
and he writes about bowling as an ex-
pert. Harris protests so much that he
becomes tiresome at times. Neither
work has any literary pretensions. Never-
theless, both should be read, by social
students as well as by sporting enthusi-
asts, for their composite portrait of an
interesting and fast-vanishing type of
Briton, and for their attitudes towards
developments which have led to mis-
understandings all over the Empire.
Study of a Wykehamist.
Both Mailey and Harris liked and re-
spected Jardine, though they looked at
him from different angles. They show
him as one of those men who made our
Empire what it was before the war. The
complete Winchester product. Win-
chester is a far more difficult school, both
to get into and to avoid being pushed
out of, than Eton or Harrow, and the
Wykehamist manner, is correspondingly
supercilious. Given the right material
Winchester turns out men who are well
fitted to shoulder the White Man’s bur-
den. This is how Mailey saw Jardine:
Seldom did he come down even to the
common level of his associates.... On the
field he always appeared to be something apart
from his comrades, and always gave the im-
pression that he was 10ne1y.... He hated sym-
pathy. He received one or two nasty cracks
when batting, but waved his sympathisers off
with “Please don’t stop. It was my fault.
Umpire, give me two legs again, please.” And
on he went with the game.
The Harris approach is more respectful:
Between the cultured product of Winchester
and Oxford and the man on the Hill at Sydney
there must inevitably be a tremendous varia-
tion of outlook.
In the sum, however, he saw Jardine as
Mailey did imperturbable, efficient,
courageous, resolute, confident in the
justice of his methods, indifferent to
public opinion. With all his fine qualities
of mind and character, Jardine has man-
aged to set large sections of the Empire
by the ears. He is a survival from a
bygone age. The Empire, including Aus-
tralia, was largely run by Jardines a few
generations ago (Bligh was a kind of
illiterate Jardine); now there are few to
do them reverence, even in India. They
have always had the defects of their
qualities, notably class and race pre-
judices and tactless superiority complexes.
Men of the sort! are only complete
successes in hierarchies —civil services,
armies, navies and the like—where posi-
tions are fixed and criticism of autho-
rity is looked on as a crime. Mailey
says shrewdly of Jardine: “He had an
idea that the Australian press was hos-
tile to Douglas Jardine when, instead,
Douglas Jardine was hostile to the Aus-
tralian press.” Similarly, he must have
been instinctively hostile to the Hill. Like
the press it would revolt him as an insti -
tution which criticised its social superiors.
Prerogative of Birth
Harris complains over and over again
of Australian barracking. It is not his
way of trying to justify bodylining; he
sincerely loathes and despises Australian
barracking. So, undoubtedly, do the
M.C.C. authorities and tens of thousands
of Englishmen. Yet barracking comes
from England: and, specifically, from
Oxford and Cambridge, Eton and Har-
row, Sandhurst and Woolwich. On Boat-
race nights, from time immemorial,
Oxford and Cambridge men have surged
into the West End and barracked stage
performers into a state of frenzy. It
reached a climax in 1927, when the
papers were full of protests from the
barrackers’ victims, male and female. The
Empire music hall in its prime had to
employ extra chuckers-out on Boatrace
night, and a number of ’Varsity men
always appeared at Bow-street next
morning. The dis-
tinguished stran-
gers who have
honorary degrees
conferred on
them at Oxford
are barracked as
a matter of course. As here the barrack-
ing takes the form of “occasional humor-
ous interjections and a mixture of rude-
ness and crudity.” Harris rebukes the
Hillites:
Payment of 2s. at a gate does not purchase a
license to act the hooligan.
It doesn’t in England, where the work-
ing-class barracker, except in the sturdy
North, has always been sternly sup-
pressed; but the possession of a certain
income or position does amount to a
license to act the hooligan within fairly
wide limits. It isn’t our barracking that
Harris, Jardine and the rest object to in
the depths of their subconscious; it is the
class of our barrackers. The principle
dates back to Shakspeare’s day. “That
in the captain’s but a choleric word which
in the soldier is flat blasphemy.”
Bodylining.
In the Tests Larwood appeared to
bowl, roughly, half an over at the man
and half at the wicket. The umpires
couldn’t assume “intent,” but onlookers
in all the stands did, and a proportion
of noisy and mostly inane self-advertisers
reacted in the same way as Stadium bar-
rackers did to Young Stribling’s claim-
ing-and-hitting. Useless for Jardine to
make speeches introducing the wistful
lines
Soberly watching the beautiful game,
Orderly, decent, calm and serene.
The Australian crowds found it as hard
to see decency in Larwood’s tactics as
a St. Andrew’s crowd would if Hagen
developed a habit of falling down noisily
in a championship match as his oppo-
nent was putting.
Harris says the innovation “can never
make cricket monotonous because there
are not enough good exponents of it.”
The seven members of the M.C.C. who,
according to a cable, wrote a joint letter
to the “Times” the other day think other-
wise.
The tactics (in the University match at Lords),
which seem to savor of those employed in
the Australian Tests, will destroy the whole
charm, spirit and enjoyment of the game.
Mailey thinks that what he calls “mod-
ernism” has come to stay; it makes
cricket more interesting. No doubt he is
right; but the effect must be to drive
all but alert young pros, out of the game
and to create even at Lord’s, a class of
proletarian barrackers, every bit as up-
roarious as the Oxonians who barracked
unpopular Proctors a few years ago, and
smashed windows and office fittings in
Clarendon Buildings.

Blood and Mud in 1917
Now that the f of battle has c} d
and the network of official and unofficial
fiction and misrepresentation has been
swept aside, we are able to realise that
the year 1917 was the crucial period of
the Great War. Other phases, earlier and
l ater , have caught the world’s attention
to a greater degree, notably the Pyrrhic
victories on the Somme and the enemv
break-through in 1918. But in 1917
Russia was throwing up the sponge
Roumania was shattered, France was all
but following the example of Russia Italy
went to her knees at Caporetto, and at
Gaza the left wing of the far-flung battle
] ine had been brought up with a round
turn . Eminent defeatists were openly
talking in France and Britain, and the
dark hour lay heavy on the Allied cause

THE WONDER
TASMA “BABY”
MAKE no mistake!—every “little” set is not a Tasma “Baby.” It takes the Tasma
“Baby” to give you big-set reception. Tasma “Baby” is a 5-valve Superhetero-
dyne—a luxury radio in miniature. It pulls in the most distant stations with amazing
clearness. You’ll be astounded at its truly extraordinary power and tone. You’ll be
delighted with its compactness—and the ease with which you can take it with you
wherever you want music. But insist on getting the Tasma “Baby”—the set which
out-performs most expensive consoles—the set which is automatically INSURED FREE
OF CHARGE against Fire and Burglary, anywhere in Australia—the set which has
created a new fashion in radio.
Tasma receivers are Detail-Built, i.e., they are not Mass Produced. Each chassis is under the
supervision of laboratory technicians and is subjected to no less than twenty-three exhaustive
and individual tests. For this reason and because their electrical and mechanical design is
acknowledged as setting a standard for the industry, Tasma receivers are the best that money
can buy.
Write to the manufacturers, Messrs. Thom & Smith, Ltd., 55-57 Dowing Street, East Sydney,
or to your nearest distributor for full descriptive literature on any or all of the receivers in the
Tasma range.

system, and the tentative pursuit. Then
follows the murderous attempt to force
the Hindenburg line at Bullecourt with
the aid of the massed tanks which were
to achieve so much and accomplish so
little. The Australians came out of this
battle grievously hurt in personnel but
, with morale little impaired. There was
an interval of German counter-attack
followed by the shattering of Nivelle’s
fantastic attempt to break the enemy line,
an attempt which resulted in the partial
mutiny and the practical immobilisation
of the French Army.
This made a British move forward
imperative, the Australian share being
another attack on Bullecourt. Here
again the troops fought themselves to a
standstill with dreadful casualties, the
four divisions engaged losing 10,000 men
in the two Bullecourts alone. Formation of
a sixth division had to be abandoned; the
men were needed to fill the gaps in those
already fighting. These battles, more
than any others, shook the faith of
the Australians in the capacity of the
High Command. But Second Bullecourt
was the last of the hopeless blood-baths.
“When next the Australian infantry en-
tered battle they found their actions
directed by higher leadership of a strik-
ingly different order.”
The second phase of the Australian
fighting in 1917 opens with Haig’s Flan-
ders plan, intended primarily to clear
the Belgian coastline. For the Austra-
lians it centred in the battle of Messines,
with its spectacular mining operations
and tremendously powerful artillery pre-
parations. The attacks were on new lines
of limited objectives after explosion of
the mines. The battle was entirely suc-
cessful a§ far as the Australians were
concerned, and the ground made was as
easily held.
On Messines followed the third battle
of Ypres with the successive phases of
Menin Road, Polygon Wood and Brood-
seinde, all unqualified if costly successes.
The advance had been a severe blow
to the enemy, who had lost heav-
ily in personnel and important terrain.
Broodseinde “was the most complete suc-
cess so far won by the British Army in
France.” With it ended, unfortunately,
the favorable weather which had contri-
buted to the advantages gained.
The Passchendale operations which were
to begin the ousting of the Germans
from Flanders broke down after days of
bloody fighting and nearly-gained suc-
cess with troops opposed, not only by a
powerful and desperate enemy, but ham-
pered by rain and mud, which were even
more formidable to overcome. Well
might Prince Rupprecht note in his diary
when the downpour set in and the attack
slowed down in the sodden ground “Sud-
den change of weather. Most gratify -
ingly raining;, our most effective ally.”
Here again the Australian losses were
terrifying, if terror could have lived
among those men.
With Second Passchendale the cam-
paign ended, and the historian closes on
a note unusual for him. The shattered
divisions, now resting from the front line,
with enlistments at home dwindling to
vanishing point, could only look for re-
inforcements “to the return of sick
and wounded men. There was some
reason to fear that the A.I.F. had passed
the zenith of its achievement, and would
have to face the fighting of 1918 in
weaker numbers and with overstrained
and inelastic material.” As we all know
now, it went on to even greater things.
J.B.H.
Our New Censors
If the appointment of the new trium-
virate of advisers to the Customs makes
any difference to the attitude towards
books, thistles will start bearing custard-
apples.
Dr. L. H. Allen is a professor of
classics. A classic is a work about which
everybody is afraid to pass an original
judgment. Rabelais is a “classic.” When
he wrote he published his books at the
risk of being burned alive and only the
patronage of highly-placed ecclesiastics
saved him for posterity. Rabelais is now
admitted to the Commonwealth, but a
modern Rabelais would be driven from
the land in which he wrote, as D. H.
Lawrence and James Joyce were driven
from Britain.
Prof. Haydon is a professor of
languages, an academic pursuit which has
only an incidental connection with
literature.
Robert Garran is a former Common-
wealth Solicitor-General and a German
scholar who has published a translation
of the poet Heine. Heine is nowadays
regarded as a great and noble thinker,
and his works are “classics.” In his life-
time, however, he was regarded as an
enemy of the law and to gain freedom he
was obliged to escape from Germany.
The law banned and expurgated his
writings and whenever he entered Ger-
many his luggage, in accordance with the
law, was searched by the Customs for
dangerous thoughts.
No doubt, the Commonwealth authori-
ties believed they were acting for the
best when they sought the assistance of
these three gentlemen, but a training in
appreciation of the classics does not
necessarily prepare the mind for appre-
ciation of living literature. In fact, it is
usually the worst possible preparation.
History shows that when a significant
work was banned, the banning was done
by the very people who read the banned
books of the past with approval, once
they had been accorded the rank of
“classics.”
S.M.
Australian Boys
In Dyson’s stories boys are usually in
the right, with a dull unobservant world
leagued against them. Lawson's boys
are roughly of two kinds: hard-up, ner-
vously energetic, responsible little boys
(such as poor little Harvie Aspinall, with
his alarm-clock sending him to work at
the factory until it can wake him no
longer); and boys from comfortable
country homes, well-fed young rips, hard-
doers, like the white boy in “Black Joe,”
who planned to go away to a hunting-
ground with his black mate.
Norman Lindsay writes consistently
from the boy’s point of view. In
“Saturdee” you can hear the very rattle
of their talk, as big boys conspire to
run away, and smaller boys beg to be
allowed to join in, with promises not to
“funk it howling first night out”:
By cripes, I wouldn’t; by cripes, what price
me failin’ off a fig-tree dead on me head, never
howled a minute. Proves l don’t funk it.
The broken and patched grammar of
that talk is more than grammar; it is
an authentic act of memory. Small boys
do talk like that in moments of emphasis
—and proud of it!
Needless to say, of course, those boys’
escapade (“No goin’ back on it. Once
gone, we never return.”) was only an
escapade, from which in great starvation
you struggled home to hear “The state
your clothes are in. And where this
instant is your brother?” Then “by
another attack of illogic for relief, Peter’s
head was again clouted, and himself
bundled off to a penitential scrubbing,
and ordered to his bed, as to a dungeon.”
This meant lying awake deciding to go
away and die next day, “and then she’d
be sorry.” The old dilemma of Tom
Sawyer: “If we could only die
temporarily!”
The boys in “Saturdee” face many of
Huck Finn’s problems, but in a more
ruthless form. Redheap is a harsher
place than the little town on the Missis-
sippi, and Peter’s mother is more unre-
lenting than Tom’s Aunt Polly, who at
times could look like an angel half-full
of pie. There is no balm in this Gilead,
and when one apparently sympathetic
character appears, the father of a new
boy, he proves to have pity for what is
called the brute creation, such as horses,
dogs and birds, but no warmth at all for
the boys that torture them. He makes
no distinction, either, between blokes
fighting and the pelting of birds or
Chows; all these are to be stopped, by
force and without explanation. It was
too much. Boys must live, decided the
boys, or it wouldn’t be a Saturdee, the
day and symbol of relief from grown-ups
and their standards. After all, there’s to
be no discharge in this war, and the book
with its sets of atrocious parents has a
monotony of hate. Perhaps this is best
expressed by one Ponkey Widgers:
“By jings, I like to see this bloke come at
me with a stick. Know what I’d do to this
bloke? Down him with a rock and into him,
Bing Biff. That’s my style. Into him quick,
Biff Bing.”
Brave words, and very inspiring, as the
author remarks. The only question that
arises in a reader’s mind is concerned
with what Ponkey would do if confronted
with a more modern world, that of
kindergartners anxious to protect, parents
even over-anxious to understand, teachers
more than half-full of psychology.
Would Biff Bing still be the answer?
NETTIE PALMER.
Fact and Fiction
From the manager of the Endeavour
Press:
A correspondent (R.P. 19/7/’33) draws atten-
tion . to some errors in G. B. Lancaster’s
“Pageant,” and suggests that novels should be
censored by “an expert” before publication.
The publisher of fiction does not presume to
edit or censor books. His job is merely to
print and distribute them. Responsibility for
the text is on the author, who passes the
proofs for press.
Of the eight “mistakes” noted in this book
of 180,000 words, two are botanical, two zoo-
logical, one is political and one climatological
It seems not unlikely that clematis could grow
in Tasmania or that bushfires could occur there
in midsummer. In our Australian edition
Hutchins school is correctly spelled. It would
appear that your correspondent has read the
English edition, in which, however, unnoticed
by him, the date of Cessation of Transporta-
tion is wrongly given as 1853. He has missed
several other apparent lapses, some of which
our proof-readers queried; but the author was
in England, and could not be consulted in
time, so we had to let them go.
Authors of imaginative works are primarily
concerned with emotional values and the major
rhythm of their stories. Minor detail fre-
quently suffers. Shakspeare gave a sea-coast
to Bohemia; Thackeray in “The Newcomes”
mistook a nautical sheet (i.e., rope) for a
sail; Dickens in “Dombey and Son” made a
character talk about “proposing” at picquet,
and Hall Caine described a horse being taken
into the weighing-room after winning the
Derby. lhe list might be extended almost
indefinitely. Every great writer has been guilty
of errors (Hardy, Stevenson, Bulwer Lytton,
Galsworthy); and who really cares?
A Satchel of Books
The latest additions to the New Adel-
phi Library are D. H. Lawrence’s Studies
in Classic American Literature, V. S.
Pritchett’s Marching Spain and Hans
Carossa’s A Childhood. Apart from
their literary merits, these volumes, which
cost 3s; 6d. each, are fine examples of
the printer’s art.
The Roving Angler, by Herbert Palmer
(J. M. Dent; 65.), is primarily for the
delectation of British fly-fishermen, wet
and dry. An entire chapter is devoted
to denunciation of the Red Palmer, a
fly which few Australians have heard of,
much less tried. It resembles what we
call a cock-a-bundy—correct spelling
coch-y-bondhu—and reads like a menace
to any angler’s peace of mind. Palmer
gossips about trouting in Britain and Ire-
land, France and Germany, and is always
informative and never dull. The book
has some charming wood-engravings by
Robert Gibbings.
The Flying Carpet, by Richard Halli-
burton (Geoffrey Bles; 165.). A spirited
account of a world-flight which began
in California, was interrupted tempor-
arily at New York, where the ’plane was
shipped to Paris (its cruising radius was
less than a thousand miles), and so on
to Timbuctoo, via Gibraltar, and back to
Paris and over the Swiss Alps and on to
Venice and the Holy Land and Persia
and India and Borneo to Manila, which
was journey’s end. The photographs with
which the book is lavishly decorated are
always interesting and often beautiful,
and the writer’s vivid, breathless style
makes him very easy to read.
Studies in the Australian Constitution,
edited by G. V. Portus (Angus and Rob-
ertson ; 55.). At the beginning of the
year the Australian Institute of Political
Science was inspired .by England’s Lib-
eral Summer Schools to organise a simi-
lar feast of learning and flow of soul at
Robertson (N.S.W.). This book is a
compendium of the views expressed on
that occasion by earnest young Sydney
men of the stamp of Norman Cowper
and W. J. V. Windeyer, together with
one or two relative articles which have
been either reprinted (“The Financial
Relations of the States and the Com-
monwealth,” by Professor Mills, appeared
originally in the “Economic Review”) or
specially written. All the articles except
the first (“Modern Constitutions,” by
W. G. K. Duncan) are of contemporary
Australian interest.
The N.S.W. Bookstall Co. has pub-
lished a new and enlarged edition of
The Bulletin Reciter at 2s. All the old
favorites are there, including the classic
“How McDougall Topped the Score”
(with illustration), and there are some
new ones which will have evoked peals
of merriment or moans of sympathetic
anguish, as the case may be, in many a
suburban drawing-room ere these lines
see print. The horse-and-dorg poets are
well represented, but, speaking person-
ally, this critic prefers the more dramatic
efforts. In Ambrose Pratt’s “The Woman
Speaks” you can almost hear the beads
on the disillusioned lady’s late-Victorian
bonnet rattling as she voices her scorn.
Ah, yes! I’m a woman and human, too;
I can laugh and weep, and —pity me!— love.
That’s the part of me made for the play of
man.
Man ! No, thanks, I can manage my glove.
The volume contains nearly a hundred
poems, grave and gay, and there is a
drawing by “Hop” on the cover.
The Bodley Head has published Angus
ancl the Cat, Angus and the Ducks and
Angus Lost at 2s. each. Angus is an en-
gaging young Scotch terrier, and these
books describe how he copes with life’s
disillusionments —or some of them. The
drawings are admirable, and the legends
should amuse grown-ups as well as
children.

BOROUGH-MONGERING.
All the principal Australian parties,
Federal and State, are now organised to
such purpose that they hold certain seats
on the same terms as rotten boroughs
were held in the eighteenth century. Reid
(N.S.W.) is an example. It belongs to
Lang Labor, and Mr. Gander has
admitted that he is holding it only till
the man who gave it to him is ready to
take it over. In practice the people have
nothing to do with the matter.
There was what the “S. M. Herald”
called in a heading “An Amusing Inter-
lude” at a recent Labor conference. Mr.
Buckland suggested that the 15 supporters
of the Scullin Government who repre-
sented constituencies in N. S. Wales, and
who remained loyal to Scullinism, mostly
with consequences unpleasant to them-
selves, should be granted immunity at
the next Commonwealth election.
A delegate: “Do you suggest that we should
sack Mr. Gander and give the Reid seat to
Mr. Coleman?”
The U.A.P. and Country parties are also
in a position to sack recalcitrants and
reward yes-men at the taxpayers’ expense.
Members who put the interests of the
party first, and who hold safe seats, are
rewarded with lucrative appointments
without reference to their qualifications.
Or they may be given the appointments
for the same reason that certain news-
papers buy their rivals, and kill them ;
because they may become dangerous. In
any event, suitability for the work doesn’t
enter into the question.
No High Commissioner, from Reid to
Ryrie, was sent to London because he
was the best man for the job ; all were
appointed because the party bosses
wished, for one reason or another, to get
them out of their seats, and, in some
cases, out of Australia. The second Pitt
suggested compensating the holders of
certain English boroughs at the market
value of their seats. Any actuary could
arrive at the market value of a safe seat,
and it might be a much better bar-
gain for the taxpayers if the occupant
were paid a lump sum for it than if he
were sent, instead, to London, at several
thousands a year and perquisites, as a
condition of handing it over to somebody
else.
The system of appointing High Com-
missioners is to be reverted to when Mr.
Bruce returns, and paragraphs like the
following are beginning to appear in
U.A.P. publications:
The claims of Mr. Hughes as Mr. Bruce’s
successor are being pressed in influential circles.
Other names mentioned are those of Defence
Minister Pearce and Gullett, ex-Minister of
Customs.
Gullett is the most suitable as regards
years, but a man who has had to resign
from a Ministry on health grounds isn’t
likely to be able to hold Australia’s end
up in strenuous London. The only
qualifications of Pearce and Hughes are
that, if they aren’t placated with 'some
plum, they have the power to make things
awkward for the dispensers of plums.
Judgeships are being awarded more and
more openly for political services ren-
dered. No one party is in a position to
adopt a self-righteous attitude as against
any other party in this respect. Parlia-
ments, Benches and offices like the High
Commissionership have been weakened
and discredited by these methods. An
effect on the electors has been to sicken
them of politics, and to turn the word
“politician” into a term of opprobrium.
It is doubtful whether, without com-
pulsory voting, more than 25 or 30 per
cent, of the electors would bother to vote
in some constituencies. At the Annandale
(N.S.W.) by-election 3221 electors broke
the law, and risked a fine of £2 each,
rather than vote for candidates forced
on them by the machines. This form of
passive resistance is likely to grow, with
excellent results from the point of view
of those who are working to overthrow
Democracy and replace it by Sovietism
or Fascism, unless some party comes out
definitely for reform ; for the abolition of
the inner-group system of party control,
and for the principle of appointing men
to high offices on the grounds of merit
alone.
The only alternative, as a matter
of practical politics, is the frank and
immediate acceptance of Tammanyism,
and the devil take the hindmost.
TOO OLD AT SIXTY.
Tn the crazy consulship of Lang many a
Government railwayman was put off
because he had turned 60. At the same
time the Tin-hare Ministry recalled the
septuagenarian Whiddon from retire-
ment to become Director of Lotteries, and
it arranged to reappoint A. B. Pidding-
ton as Industrial Commissioner for seven
years, with powers greater in some re-
spects than those since granted to and
now being exercised by President Roose-
velt. “Good Old Piddo” was then in his
seventieth year.
It was hoped that the Stevens Govern-
ment would show more regard for the
fitness of things, but in this matter it
has proved just as erratic. It recently dug
out the superannuated O’Malley Wood,
77 years of age, and made him chair-
man of the reconstituted Rural Bank
Board. It now proposes, if the public
will stand it, to lower the compulsory
retiring age in the State civil service
from 65 years to 60, a “reform” which
would involve the dismissal of hundreds
of men in high positions, nearly all of
whom are capable of carrying on.
This baffling form of inconsistency is by
no means confined to N. S. Wales, The
Queensland Labor Government lately
called upon a number of veteran public
servants to retire. It made an excep-
tion in the case of the Commissioner of
Police, though he was older than depart-
mental heads summarily got rid of, on
the ground that the Ministry could not
do without him. Pearce, the Minister for
Defence, found that he had no further
use for Brigadier-General Brand, who
joined the staff of the A.M.F. after re-
turning from the South African cam-
paign with the Queen’s medal and five
clasps. In Gallipoli and France Brand
was in everything, and if the question had
been referred to the R.S.L. executives
there would have been a unanimous vote
for keeping him on; but Pearce,
who is 63, is mighty, and Pearce pre-
vailed. Brand was 59 when the blow
fell ; because they are entitled to holi-
days men due for the sack at 60 depart
many months earlier. There is no com-
pulsory retiring age for Justices of the
High Court, so Duffy, C.J., keeps going
at 81. His predecessor was elevated at
75. That dignitary, of course, became
Governor-General, and on August 6
Isaacs, G.-G., will be 78. It should be
said that in neither of these cases is
there any sign of failing powers.
If the Allies had acted on the prin-
ciple that generals are too old at 60, it is
doubtful whether they would have won
the war. Gallieni was 65 when he com-
mandeered the Paris taxi-cabs and hur-
ried reinforcements to Maunoury’s army
—the manoeuvre that decided the first
Battle of the Marne. By many French-
men Gallieni is regarded as the saviour
of France. Joffre, Foch, Castelnau and
Maunoury were likewise in the sixties
when First Marne was fought, and so
was John French. Foch was 66 when, as
commander-in-chief of the French,
British, Americans, Italians and Belgians,
he defeated the invaders in Second
Marne, and 67 when he received their
surrender. At 67 Hindenburg broke the
Russians in the battles of Tannenberg
and the Masurian Lakes. When just on
78 he was named President of the Ger-
man Republic. Last April, being then
four months short of 85, he was re-
elected for seven years.
When is a man old, in every sense of
the word? It depends on the kind of
man he is. Some are spent forces at 40 ;
others are sound in mind and body, and
even youthful in thought and feeling, in
the seventies. Since the claims of youth
are strong, and legitimate ambitions
must not be thwarted, it is necessary to
have a retiring age for civil servants, and
65 seems a fair thing ; but it should not
be made a hard and fast rule. The pub-
lic interest should be the deciding factor,
and it might be promoted in some in-
stances by delicately reminding pre-
maturely-aged officers of 50-odd that
they are no longer equal to the job ; in
others, by retaining the services of men
past 65 whose capacity is unimpaired
and who still set an inspiring example.
In any case, it would be idiotic to dis-
miss all the N.S.W. civil servants who are
in their sixtieth year. It would mean a
great loss of character and ability, and
a great immediate expenditure on long-
service leave; and it will not be
tolerated.
MORE REFLECTIONS OF LIM.
“I see,” said General Lim Sam Kee,
meditatively rubbing up his inkstick,
“that the statesmen of the West have
failed in their attempt to bring the
nations of the world into agreement on
the economic question. Disinterested as
no doubt their intention was, I am not
surprised that it was not realised. We in
Asia are familiar with efforts to control
our destinies for our own good through
the operations of international finajice.
“China has from time to time been ruled
by Five-Power, Seven-Power and nth-
Power consortiums ; but they have never
lasted, owing to internal jealousies. These
attempts we have opposed in every way
possible, even to pouring out our blood
in hopeless wars with adversaries 50 times
as strong as we are; for we know only
too well what is lying in store for us.
“In Asia the historic technique of the
international financier has been to advance
loans to feeble native governments in
return for concessions. This makes the
governments strong but unpopular. A
national movement, hitherto entirely alien
to the Asiatic mind, makes its appear-
ance. The shah, sultan, Son of Heaven,
semi-constitutional government or king
uses the foreign money to suppress re-
volt, and does it with an Oriental fero-
city that pains and astonishes Western
humanitarians. Sometimes the national-
ists have a temporary success, and they
inaugurate a grand campaign of queue-
cutting, votes-for-women and other terms
of modernisation. But in the end they
have to do what the previous govern-
ment did —go to the financiers for further
accommodation.
“The price is invariably the suppression
or sterilisation of the national movement.
The new government becomes as con-
servative and despotic as the old, and a
new and more extreme national move-
ment comes into being. Thus the coun-
try goes more and more swiftly down
the steep slope to chaos and servitude.
This is the cause of much of the so-called
inability of Asiatic countries to govern
themselves, though there are others in
their failure to adjust their laws and
social life to the immense changes
wrought by Western industrialism.
“Now, it seems, the people of the West
are engaged in the same desperate
struggle to solve the same terrific problem.
For, strange as it may appear, the
Europeanisation of Asia has gone hand
in hand with the Asiaticisation of Europe.
Only the technique is slightly different.
“Most small European countries are rea-
sonably well governed. It is difficult for
a Power like Germany to arouse popular
fanaticism for a crusade to force better
laws, morality and religion on the Danes,
whereas it was easy for the Protestant
Kaiser to make the Germans believe that
it was a Christian act for him to seize a
Chinese province with a valuable coal-
mine in it as a punishment for the mur-
der of Roman Catholic missionaries.
Ffence, west of Suez, the respectable ideal
of the White Man’s burden has had no
Kipling for its laureate.
“The rivalries of two imperialisms
have sometimes preserved the in-
tegrity of an Asiatic State ; for instance,
Siam. But this rivalry is a much stronger
force in Europe. France may annex Cam-
bodia without precipitating a general con-
flict, but if it attempted to annex Hol-
land the whole balance of power in
Europe would be threatened. France’s
occupation of the Ruhr united the whole
of Europe temporarily against it.
“Hence the international financier in
Europe is to be found advancing money
through strong governments to weaker
ones, in return for military and commer-
cial alliances. France, having learnt its
lesson in the Ruhr, turned to Poland and
lent that country enough money to make
it into a first-class military Power and a
bulwark against France’s potential
enemies. The concessions involve no direct
political control, which would alarm the
people, but they are sufficiently import-
ant to make it possible for Britain to exact
civilised treatment in Russian courts for
its nationals. Few small nations dare
stand alone, and national boundaries
have become sentimental fictions cut
across by financial ones.
“If the international financier were
also the international policeman, with the
biggest army, navy and air force in exist-
ence, he might establish order. But
the only force at his disposal is the moral
prestige of the League of Nations, which
has not even been able to stop a war
between two little States in South
America. Nor is it certain that the people
of the West, despite their misery, desire
a financiers’ paradise, any more than
their Asiatic brothers. ‘All under
Heaven,’ said Confucius, ‘are one family.’
This is a self-evident truth, but the
spiritual domination of Heaven is a very
different thing from any form of prac-
tical control men have yet devised for
the supposed good of their fellows ”
FENG-SHUI.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Achievement of McPhee.
Really the most remarkable person
among the Premiers is the one of whom
the public hears least—John Cameron
McPhee, of Tasmania.
In every other State, and in the Com-
monwealth itself, Government after Gov-
ernment has fallen during the depression.
The Commonwealth has had Bruce,
Scullin and Lyons ; N. S. Wales, Bavin,
Lang and Stevens ; Victoria, McPherson,
Hogan and Argyle ; Queensland, McCor-
mack, Moore and Forgan Smith ; South
Aus., Butler, Hill and Butler again;
Westralia, Collier, Mitchell and Collier
again; but Tasmania has not changed
McPhee. He arrived a year before the
slump, and he may outlive it as Premier.
A Tasmanian delegate to the A.L.P.
unity conference in Sydney ruefully re-
marked that there was no Labor faction
light in his State. He explained that the
possibility of a Labor Government being
returned was remote, “so there is noth-
ing to fight over.” No other gentleman
from the Speck disputed this admission
that the McPhee Government is strongly
entrenched.
McPhee was the first Premier to make
unemployed-relief money available for
farm improvements. By common consent
the money has been well spent, and when
it was proposed recently to increase the
vote (here was no opposition from arry
quarter. But the McPhee Government
has done even better than that. Lasl
year it budgeted for a deficit of £124,00C
and got the thing down to £55,000. Cer-
tainly it received a special grant of
£330,000 from the Commonwealth, com-
pared with £250,000 in 1931-32; but the
Westralian Government received a special
grant of £500,000 and wound up with a
deficit of £864,000. Tax-revenue in the
Speck increased from £905,700 to
£1,003,000, though there was a fall of
nearly £34,0000 in receipts from stamp
duties—on sweep tickets mostly. Ex-
penditure came down £79,700 —from
£2,657,100 to £2,577,400.
The late conversion of six per cents, in
London will mean a saving to Tasmania
of £60,000 p.a. in interest and exchange.
If revenue keeps up and expenditure is
held in check and the Commonwealth
comes to light with another £330,000 —
£380,000 is hoped for—the only remain-
ing pre-depression Premier may be the
first to balance a depression budget. He
is the son of a Scotch farmer, and was
a farmer himself, so tenacity and canni-
ness were born and bred in him.
4
Going Ahead with Secession.
The Lieut.-Governor’s speech at the
opening of the Westralian Parliament
was a Jeremiad framed to justify the
statement that the Labor Ministry is con-
sidering the best means of giving effect
to the vote for secession. Facts, how-
ever, scarcely support the Jeremiahs.
If it is hard to collect revenue it is
perhaps because of the uncertainty created
by the referendum vote; it shouldn’t be
hard to collect revenue from mineowners,
with gold production going ahead so fast.
If it has been necessary to “reduce expen-
diture heavily already,” there has been
less reason in the economic position of
Westralia than in that of some of the
other States, which have also done some
heavy reducing.
Westralia has had no Lang. Its unem-
ployment rate improved by 10 per cent,
during the first quarter of 1933, and is
now 3 per cent, better than that of either
N. S. Wales or S. Aus. Its weighted
average nominal weekly-wage rate for
males is higher than in any State except
N. S. Wales and Queensland; for females,
it is 3s. higher than in any State what-
ever, and ss. sd. higher than the Com-
monwealth average. Its cost-of-living
index is less by 30 points than that of
Victoria, and 62 points lower than the
Commonwealth average for six capitals.
Its marriage rate is the highest in the
Commonwealth. It has only one-third of
its total Commonwealth land tax debit
outstanding against the Commonwealth
average of 40 per cent., only 15s. per head
of income tax uncollected, against 17s. 7d.
per head in N. S. Wales and 16s. Bd. per
head average throughout the Common-
wealth.
Lastly, Westralia has had in the past
four years special grants of £1,400,000
which it would otherwise have had to
get in local taxation. And it is to get an
“extra-special one” of £lOO,OOO this year
out of the Commonwealth surplus.
So the other States have not been so
brutal after all, though the Collier Gov-
ernment professes, with its tongue in its
cheek, to be anxious to break with them.


Education and a Miracle.
N. S. Wales Education Minister Drum-
mond, following the custom of shoving
Government loads on other people’s
shoulders, has appointed a committee of
32 experts to inquire into the State
schooling system, particularly examina-
tions. How the gentleman knows that
an unnamed person from, say, the Junior
Farmers’ Club Council or the Cham-
ber of Commerce —both are to be repre-
sented —will be “expert” in education it
is difficult to tell.
Nothing can be expected of such a
committee. It will air a lot of theories,
earn a lot of publicity and make either
a report which will be a compromise or
two reports which will entirely disagree
with one another. Each “expert,” elected
to serve an interest, will take a sectional
view ; the less his actual expertness, the
more dogmatic he will be, and the more
anxious to return to those who sent him
with the glad news that he has done
something for his industry or coterie.
There are only two things wrong with
our Government system of education,
so-called. There is too much of it, and
it is too formalised. The average young-
ster spends so much time cramming that
he has no time to think for himself ; and
self-reliance is killed. His remedy for
every ill, his inevitable last resource, be-
comes —the committee.
Mr. Drummond and his fellows are all
unfortunate products of this system ;
hence their love of royal commissions,
which are expected to make their deci-
sions for them. Mr. Lang is a victim
of it; hence his subservience to inner
groups.
Newton, Faraday, Lister, Shakspeare,
Milton, Savonarola, Erasmus, Dr. John-
son and a host of other individual celebri-
ties have their memorials. But there is
only one monument to a committee any-
where in the world. It was raised to
those citizens of Calais who surrendered
to the English with halters round their
necks.

Raising Prices.
Dear Bulletin, —The economic problem
of the world is chiefly one of debts and
frozen assets. The debts, private or
national, were largely incurred in times
of boom' or war, and it is debt that is
keeping in a frozen state many assets
which might otherwise be productive.
While prices were high debts were not
felt to anything like the extent that they
are felt now. Factory turnovers ex-
panded; interest, wages and dividends,
though high, were paid comfortably.
Money was easy to make on the Stock
Exchange, and staggering sums, in New
York, London and even Australia, were
diverted from legitimate trade into the
hunt for profits. These profits were easy
for those who got out in time. But
somebody had to pay, and payment has
become appallingly hard since the un-
healthy bubble burst, and prices crashed
to the lowest level for a generation.
President Roosevelt is experimenting
with inflation as a means of restoring
American prices to pre-depression levels.
His policy is to thaw the frozen assets
with a flow of price-raising credit with-
out ostensibly interfering with debts. It
is the line of least resistance ; but it pos-
sesses a great danger. The flow of credit
will have to be most carefully directed ;
otherwise, after a temporary jag, things
may freeze up on a larger scale than ever.
A safer but more controversial course
would be to reduce all boom-time debts
compulsorily to the same purchasing-
power basis as when they were incurred.
After it was once passed into law such
an enactment would be outside the con-
trol of politicians. Creditors would suffer
no more than under a system of inflation
—and that is assuming that inflation
could be successfully carried out.
The U.S. programme already shows
signs of ending in disaster. —Yours etc.,
K. David.

Hitler and the Woman Problem.
Every new dictator tries to solve the pro-
blem of women who elbow male workers
out of industry. Mussolini had a shot at
it and failed ; his subsequent prizes for
large families led, of course, to the birth
of more women. Roosevelt’s schemes
will- put many women out of work, but
it will be mostly in the heavy industries
and factories. To displace women deli-
berately from the typewriter, the tele-
phone, the cash-desk and the department
store would be to shake the very foun-
dations of North American nationhood
and set the Eagle screaming from Los
Angeles to Narragansett.
Hitler is the latest recruit -to the Away-
with-Women movement. His idea is to
get them expelled from offices and
factories by marrying them off to young
men, who, by way of compensation for
the inconvenience incurred in taking
them, are to have loans ranging from
£l5 to £5O with which to buy household
goods and chattels. Naturally, every
couple who intended to get married any-
way sprinted for the loan office, more
especially as bachelors and spinsters who
have incomes of more than £l5 a month
are to be taxed.
Hitler expects that within four years
he will by this scheme withdraw
1,000,000 women from industry. But the
surplus of women in Germany at the
last census was 2,000,000. Anyway, the
Hitler scheme is a move backward. There
are so many jobs that women and women
only can do well that anybody who tries
to replace them with men will soon learn
his lesson.
Isn’t it time it was recognised that
women have as much right to control
their lives as men? Even in Australia, as
the electoral figures show, in Big-City
suburbs from which Millie, Bella and
Maud swarm to shops and offices, ware-
houses and factories, there are 15 p.c.
to 25 p.c. more women than men. Hi
would fare the imitation Hitler with a
plan for compelling these self-reliant
young women to accept the fate of their
abo. sisters, and see in marriage and a
rigidly-controlled domestic slavery the
proper feminine sphere.

The U.S.A. Market Smash.
Franklin D. Roosevelt is learning
quickly what it means to be a Utopian
autocrat in a hard world. Coming to
office with a complete plan for the resto-
ration of the U.S.A., he found himself
up against human nature.
Mr. Roosevelt’s taking of authority to
halve the gold in the dollar was followed
by a rush to Wall-street to buy com-
modity stocks. This frightened the re-
former off his immediate project.
Now, after three months’ interval, dur-
ing which he has been forced to leave
the World Economic Conference to its
own devices, and has suffered the tortures
of political and speculative pressure —the
portion of everyone who shows an in-
clination to inflate or to monkey with
natural financial laws —there has been
just as mad a rush by his admirers to get
rid of the stocks, particularly the grain
stocks, which they have been so hope-
fully buying.
The only good thing achieved is that
the crash —nearly as bad as that of 1929
—has brought the dollar back a few
points towards its natural level. But the
events of the past week have added no-
thing to world confidence in the Roose-
velt plan of produce-restriction. It is
merely an invitation to other countries
to expand their production so as to take
advantage of Uncle Sam’s constriction of
supplies.
Balbo the Safe.
When the history of the first half-century
of aviation comes to be written a place
of honor among the pioneers will cer-
tainly be given to General Balbo, the
Italian Air Minister, who has shown his
practical appreciation of the responsibili-
ties of his job by taking a squadron of
24 big seaplanes across the Atlantic. He
has been asked to bring it to Australia,
but acceptance of the invitation is un-
likely.
The flight was planned as a gesture of
courtesy to the U.S.A., the ’planes land-
ing at Chicago, where a “world exposi-
tion” is in progress. There was no hurry
about the business. The journey from
Ortobello to Chicago, via Iceland and
Labrador, a distance of 7000 miles, occu-
pied 15 days.
Lindbergh flew solo from Minneola
(N.Y.) to Paris in a little over a
day, but with him brief time was part
of the necessities of the occasion. He
staked success or failure on the integrity
of one set of engines. The Italians set
out to demonstrate that their 48 Isotta-
Fraschini motors, their 24 Savoia-Mar-
chetti ’planes and their 85 men could
safely accomplish, in unison, a flight
from the Old World to the New. The
odds against success on a journey that
included one of the most difficult ocean
crossings the world affords (some of those
who have tried both consider the Tasman
even riskier, but that’s by the way), were
not merely 24 times as high as those
against a solo flyer, but probably nearer
24 times 24.
Balbo brought his team through with a
record of no casualties, no mechanical
failures. He accomplished that, in face
of fogs and other difficulties, by taking
no weather risks that could be avoided,
by using the finest radio equipment that
could be devised to supplement the eyes
and ears of his pilots and navigators, and
by establishing on the critical portions
of his route a series of floating meteoro-
logical stations with which his fleet kept
closely in touch.
Not so spectacular nor so sensational
as the wild gambles with death that have
brought fame to other airmen, Balbo’s
organised flight has value in that it
appears to usher in an era in which flying
has attained to the age of commonsense.
The boast of Balbo is not “how fast!”
nor “how daring! ” but “how safe! ” And
that seems to be precisely what is needed,-
in the present stage of aviation develop-
ment, to pave the way for more confident
usage of the speediest means of trans-
port yet vouchsafed to the human race.

Results of Paternalism.
Dear Bulletin, —Government paternal-
ism is certainly encouraging couples who
cannot support small families successfully
to produce large families (B. 5/7/’33),
but it is having the reverse effect on
those who accept the old-fashioned doc-
trine of parental responsibility.
Take our case. My husband, son of a
farmer, rejected a university exhibition to
go on the land. Before marriage I was
a teacher. We are healthy, and we have
two children, splendid specimens. We
should like to have four, but the farm
won’t run to it, and there is no family
endowment or the like for us.
When the children have exhausted the
possibilities of the local school our boy
and girl must go to boarding school;
there is no State high school within 60
miles. It would blight their future if
we had more children. We should have
to pay doctor and nurse —private hospi-
tal, of course; the local public hospital
does not take maternity cases. So we
must restrict our offspring to two, and
continue to pay taxes that undesirables
may be helped to bring more undesir-
ables into the world.
A mile away lives a family in whiqh
there are nine children, the eldest 16. All
are sub-normal; none is physically
healthy. All on the dole, of course, and
in receipt of family endowment, and
child-welfare payments, and invalid pen-
sions, and the Lord knows what else.—
Yours, etc., Mater.

Something for Nothing.
Dear Bulletin, —The N. S. Wales
Lotteries and Art Unions Act, which a
benign Government invented to protect
our morals, says that anybody who prints
and publishes any advertisement or in-
formation in furtherance of a lottery
conducted outside N. S. Wales, “whether
described as a lottery or as a sweep,
consultation or golden casket,” shall be
liable to a penalty not exceeding £2OO.
So you will understand that if the rest
of this letter is a bit mysterious it is
because it seems to me (without preju-
dice, because I do not wish to incrimin-
ate myself) that the very facts as pub-
lished here if referring specifically to a
lottery (which, m’Lud, I don’t admit)
might make me legally liable. You, too.
The fact is, however, that I have re-
ceived through the post from a foreign
State (which may or may not be
separated from N. S. Wales by a dry
river with a Scottish name, and a range
of mountains equally Caledonian) a
bundle of documents, one of which offers
me “£250 free,” and also ‘£loo, £5O and
ten amounts of £25 each,” if I will
merely let my friends in on a good thing
by distributing some application forms.
With the aid of these and a pound note
my friends are to win £25,000 in some
mysterious manner which it is dangerous
for me to specify. I am told there are
“no restrictions on the use of the mails”;
and, to tempt me, the pamphlet includes
a list of people in N. S. Wales, together
with their addresses, who already have
won hundreds of pounds in the same
manner. Some of them appear to have
won from £25 to £lOO by giving applica-
tion forms to themselves.
“Remember,” says the pamphlet—
which looks as if it were intended to
advertise a basement bargain sale —“re-
member these people did not have to
spend one penny to win these handsome
prizes, and they did not even have to
sell anything. Just give the enclosed
forms to people who will use them and
you may get a prize for nothing.”
All of which leads me to reflect —•
not, of course, apropos of anything set
down, but just as a detached thought:
(1) That it is strange how different offi-
cial moral outlooks may be on the two
sides of Scotch-named mountains; (2)
that in the underworld it is a strict rule
that, while you may suborn the weak
to break the law, you do not publish
their names and addresses by way of
handing them over to the powers that
be; (3) that our Post Office, owned and
controlled by the source of Supreme
Sovereign Law in this Commonwealth,
is a large-minded institution which
appears to be ready to help further an
illegal act, so long as that act is profit-
able to itself and is committed by a pub-
lic authority, and not by an individual.
—Yours, El Verdugo.

The Japanese in the North.
It is the Dutch in the N.E.I. who now
have the creepy-crawlies about Japan.
There may be no basis for their fears,
but they qyote chapter and verse for
various manifestations of Japanese in-
terest in their vast archipelago which, to
say the least, are mysterious.
A Japanese syndicate took up a big
timber concession on the island of Rang-
sang, between Sumatra and Singapore.
The co. did not prosper, and the rent
had not been paid for years. It was
expected that the enterprise would col-
lapse. A Japanese in Singapore sud-
denly paid the arrears, and the co. con-
tinues to exist without flourishing, like
most of the Japanese rubber concessions
in Sumatra itself. One of these was
taken up when rubber had already
become unpayable, and the place selected
was almost a stony desert.
The Jap fisherman is found all round
the archipelago and thrives. The same
cannot be said for other tropical projects
of the Nipponese.
Sometimes a Dutch official, going up
a remote river, is surprised to find the
Japanese in occupation, if not actively
engaged in productive industry. He
wonders why they take up costly con-
cessions in places where there is no pos-
sible profit to be made.
There is a curious similarity, according
to the Hollanders, between the Sumatran
activities of the Japs and their enterprises
in New Guinea and Borneo. They are
grouped near strategic points.

The Jew Hits Back.
There has been a world conference of
Jews “to consider the best means of
applying a complete economic boycott
to Germany.” A partial boycott has
already been declared.
The Jew, though he has had many
provocations through the centuries, has
hitherto refrained from threats of organ-
ised reprisals. His sense of nationalism,
nurtured on tradition, has remained
potent, but a sense of nationalism with-
out a homeland with which to associate
it leaves the nationalist a mariner without
compass. Hitherto the rest of the world
has been able to say to the Jew: “If
you don’t like us, get out, and take your
chances in some other exile.” At long
last the Jew is able to retort: “All right;
I’ll get out. I have a home of my own
to go to.”
The ability to make that retort, created
by the establishment of a pastoral and
agricultural settlement for Jews in Pales-
tine, is a new factor in world politics.
Whether it is a beneficial factor or not
remains to be seen.
“THE BULLETIN” RETURNS THANKS.
Before the first issue in the London “Times” type was a day
old, the office telephones buzzed with congratulatory messages from
readers whose good opinion is valued.
Since then, every mail has brought letters in the same generous
strain, and subscribers in distant places have conveyed their appreci-
ation in telegrams.
“The Bulletin” is grateful for these spontaneous expressions
of goodwill, which will inspire it with the determination to keep
its old friends and make a multitude of new ones.


SOCIETY
"AND IT'S PRINTED WITH WIMBLE'S INKS"
“Kerys”: The census man thought some-
thing was wrong. “Excuse me, Madam,”
he said, “but you have put down one child
aged 12 and another aged 10, and the
period of your marriage as only six
years.” “And you mind your own busi-
ness!” said the lady as she banged the
door.

“X.S.”: A medical visitor from British
Guiana will have something to remember
Melbourne by. Taking the Common-
wealth Treasurer’s printed statement on
£l5O worth of pound notes that he would
receive “one pound in gold on demand”
as meaning what it said, he repaired to
the State Treasury. Officials there re-
ferred him to the Commonwealth Trea-
sury. He lost his way, and turned up in
the porch of the Public Works. There
he met two well-dressed and extremely
obliging gentlemen, one of whom, when
he heard of the doctor’s quest, explained
that he himself was chief accountant at
the Commonwealth Treasury, and his
friend was assistant treasurer. He told
“Mummy, isn’t it wrong to strike anyone smaller than yourself?”
“Yes, dear.”
“Would you mind telling teacher? I don’t think she knows.”
the visitor to wait in the passage while
he went to “inquire,” presumably
whether the Commonwealth could sus-
tain the proposed drain on its gold re-
serves, and he returned minus his coat
and hat. The trusting physician then took
out his notes to count them, whereupon
one of the strangers grabbed them, and
both walked rapidly away in different
directions. He pursued first one and then
the other, but the “chief accountant” and
the “assistant treasurer” had vanished.

“Hayband”: I nominate the section of
Woolloomooloo (Sydney) bounded by
Bourke, Dowling, Nicholson and Cath-
edral streets as Australia’s most cosmo-
politan patch. At the census-taking 240
houses yielded, besides natives of every
Australian State and M.L., representa-
tives of almost every portion of the
Empire, including Malta, Newfoundland,
Mauritius and the Seychelles. Yankees
were in good supply, also natives of
several of the South American republics.
A Frenchman minus an arm and a Ger-
man short of a leg—both ex-soldiers —
shared a room. Italians, Greeks,
Spaniards, Portuguese, Esthonians, Lith-
uanians, Czecho-Slovakians, Russians,
Assyrians, Japanese and Hindus material-
ised. Some names: Wegemand, Domini-
sci, Vicilich, Zasus, Obeyesecsakera, Pag-
liacci, Deposito, Mizzi and Movitzo.
Despite their varied ancestry, 90 per cent,
of the children were typical Australian
youngsters.

“Nakh”: There is a cultured pawn-
broker in Fitzroy (Melb.). On his shop
is the legend “Oh, my prophetic soul,
my uncle!”

“T.H.U.”: Yes, the depression is lift-
ing. Hard times bring into circulation
freak money, coins that people
would prefer to keep. During 1932
our little business received one or
two Canberra florins every day;
the first month of this year they
were down to about two a week ;
for the last four months we haven’t
taken a single one. The inference
I draw is that our customers are again
hanging on to them as curios.

“Pawang”: So Lord Burghley says
the race is improving physically (B.
19/7/’33). If so, it must be in' spite
of the influence of the movies. 1 have
questioned young men lately as to
their ideal of feminine beauty, and they
all plumped for the Garbo-Dietrich type
of woman. The thin woman is not neces-
sarily unfitted for keeping cradles full,
but where ideals of beauty tend away
from Rembrandt and Rubens towards
Hollywood, the girl with narrow hips,
which are going to give her a lot of
trouble in child-bearing, may masquerade
as the ideal type of the nation’s future
mothers. The ballrooms are full of this
variety, with the plump ones looking on
disconsolately. Douglas Mawson used to
deplore the way men kept on marrying
emaciated women, and held that if the
fashion changed to big, strapping females
the race would improve out of recogni-
tion in a couple of generations.
* * * *
“X.S.”: Titles die harder in a demo-
cracy than anywhere else. A Gent. One,
who described the defendant in a St.
Kilda case as “this woman,” was brought
up with a round turn when
the lady leapt to her feet and
shouted, “This woman! How
dare you!” In Moscow the
deadliest insult a proletarian
can fling at a person sus-
pected of borjoice sympathies
is “You’re no worker!”'
Nevertheless, titles of distinc-
tion are steadily beginning to
make their appearance under
the Soviet regime. “Honored
Artist of the Republic” and
“People’s Artist of the Re-
public” are distinctions con-
ferred only on actors of the
highest rank.
* * * *
“C.Q.”: A novel plea was
made by a man charged with
a triple bigamy in Mel-
bourne. He stated that he
was under the impression
“Here, why are you making faces at that bulldog?"
“He begun it.”
that, as he was already married to one
woman, the ceremonies subsequently per-
formed were not marriages ; therefore he
hadn’t committed bigamy!
* * * *
“Scelestus”: Alsatian dogs may prove
useful additions to the Sydney police
force (B. 19/7/’33), but they have noth-
ing in common with bloodhounds. In
“Within Four Walls,” by two English
officers, who several times escaped from
German prison camps (generally to be
recaptured), it is mentioned that two
Alsatians were requisitioned to discover
which way the escapees had gone, and, to
furnish them with the necessary clue, were
supplied with the bedclothes in which
the missing officers had slept on the pre-
ceding night. They took as much in-
terest in these as “they might have done
in a lamp-post.”

“Lao-dah”: Having heard confessions
of unspecified “sin” fall from the lips of
hardened veterans at Salv’army meetings
in Australia and similar vague revelations
from tiny tots at missionary revivalist
campaigns in China, I have often won-
dered what the offences were which so
grimly tore the consciences of these com-
municants. Some light has been thrown
on the matter by a letter received by the
Vic. Railways with an order for half a
crown enclosed. This is what the letter
said:
“During 1923, when without money, t
travelled from Melbourne to Mordialloc with-
out a ticket, thus defrauding your department
of the price of a second-class ticket between
the places named. Please find herewith 2s. 6d.,
which should cover the cost of the ticket and
interest on the same to date One must be
willing to confess and forsake sin and make
restitution when possible.”
The writer is a missionary in the Flowery
Land.

“Peter Quince”: The banana had to fight
against a strong prejudice when it was
first introduced to British palates. “Soap-
like” was one disparaging verdict I
heard not 50 years ago. Possibly Mac-
aulay had something to do with it. Mil-
lions of people in those days must have
read how when he went to India (about
a century ago) he looked to find the fruits
of the tropics a rare luxury, and, after
a few trials, decided that the whole lot
weren’t worth a pottle of Covent Garden
strawberries. “The plantain,” he recorded
in one of his letters, “is like a rotten
pear; the yam is like an indifferent
potato.” I suppose a plantain tastes
much the same as a banana. Macaulay
was probably less insular than most Eng-
lishmen of his period, but the fact is
that a taste for most fruits must be
acquired in childhood or it may be hard
to acquire at all. I have sometimes won-
dered what an Australian (say) visiting
England would make of the English
medlar, a fruit which isn't fit to eat until
it is rottener than Macaulay found the
plantain.
“Mop Up”: The contention that the
phrase “too rough” as applied by the
A.I.F. to the first American troops to go
into action with them (B. 19/7/’33) re-
ferred rather to their ignorance of their
job than to their ferocity is undoubtedly
correct. In any case, only four companies
of Americans were at Hamel. Concerning
the two divisions which took part under
Monash in the attack on the Hinden-
burg system in September, 1918, that
commander mentions in his book that
they were “lacking in war experience,
training and knowledge of technique:
had not learned the virtues of un-
questioning obedience, of punctuality, of
quick initiative: many were unfamiliar
with the weapons.” The story of how
they overran their objectives, failing to
mop up the dug-outs full of Germans so
that the Australians following them had
all the work to do over again, is familiar
to most soldiers of the time. Eager they
were, but “rough”—as bags.
* * * *
“Chirurgeon”: Don’t be too sure that
leeches are a thing of the past in medical
practice (B. 12/7/’33). There are still
chemists who can get you a supply,
and only a month ago I heard of a batch
being commanded to relieve a bad case
of eye congestion. That was a prescrip-
tion case, but a chemist friend assures
me that for a black eye a couple of
leeches will beat all the steak that ever
came out of Homebush.
* * * *
“D.”: Thomas Courtney, in an amus-
ing “S. M. Herald” article on “The Van-
ished Walking-stick,” asked how modern
man has come to “get relieved of the
incubus.” The process first started with
what Fliigel called “the Great Renun-
ciation” of the eighteenth century. The
French Revolution caused many male
Europeans to stop beautifying them-
selves. The stick is a survival, like man-
kind’s fragmentary tail; it used to be a
sword. Sticks might have lasted longer
as indications of the owners’ class
(Britons now living can recall when a
stick entitled a Londoner to “the right
of the pavement” as against one without
a stick) but for the arrival of motor-cars.
Nowadays the ownership of a stick sug-
gests the lack of a car. The stick sur-
vives chiefly as an adjunct to the topper;
a frightful garment which virtually re-
presents man’s last attempt to assert
social superiority on sartorial lines. May-
fair will not readily let the topper die.
The wearer needs the training of a life-
time if he i$ not to look like an under-
taker. If you doubt it compare, say,
the Prince of Wales in one with an Aus-
tralian politician.
THOSE SPATS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“ ‘Australia used to object to my spats,’ Mr. Bruce
told a London audience, ‘but I was not going- to
be beaten by the newspapers or anyone else, so I
ordered six pairs from England. I had to wear
the wretched things for four years.’”
Those spatterdashes Stanley wore
(And rugged democrats condemn),
How strange we never knew before
The wherefore and the why of them!
’Twas not to save his trousers’ hem
That on those frills he set such store;
They were not donned for swank or “form,”
Nor yet to keep his trilbies warm,
Those spatterdashes Stanley wore.
Those spatterdashes Stanley wore,
Whereon men bent a curious gaze
And muttered that he hadn’t forswore
Old Cambridge modes and Bond-street ways
And similar patrician traits,
A very diff’rent meaning bore;
In fact their owner they pronounced
A man who simply wouldn’t be bounced,
Those spatterdashes Stanley wore.
Those spatterdashes Stanley wore,
We used to deem he loved them well.
Unworthy thought! Injustice sore!
They merely stood for Principle.
He didn’t really think them swell.
Only the more chaps sneered, the more
Determined and resolved he grew
Not to be thus dictated to
Concerning anything he wore.
Those spatterdashes Stanley wore,
They just proclaimed he wouldn’t be beat;
They showed beneath the rind the core,
Displayed the man above the feet.
Now some amende is surely meet
To him the martyr’s cross who bore.
Although he steeled himself t’ ignore
The sneer that cuts, the gibe that stings,
At heart he cursed the wretched things,
Those spatterdashes Stanley wore!

“Adelaide”: What’s in a name? An
Anglican Church diocesan mission is
being conducted in S. Aus. just now by
an expert from the Community of the
Ascension at Goulburn (N.S.W.). His
name is Cohen.

“F.1.A.T.” : How many motorists know
that to give people lifts may involve
them (the motorists) in financial ruin?
In London King’s Bench Division last
week a widow and her son got £13,000
damages out of a friend of the family
in whose car the breadwinner was killed
T ORTOISE: “Dammit! Don’t keep knocking like that! Don't you understand
that when I’m in I’m out?”
as a result of a collision. In America
a motorist, signalled by a strange
pedestrian in a snowstorm, picked the
wayfarer up as a matter of charity, and
a few minutes later struck a greasy patch
and turned the car over. The injuries
suffered by the passenger cost the vehicle-
owner nearly £2OOO. In the early days
of English motoring swindlers used
to get in the way of cars, and, trad-
ing on the unpopularity of the new means
of transport, blackmail the owners
through crook lawyers. Judging by a
recent cable, the practice has been re-
vived in New York ; but as a paying
racket it hasn’t much hope of success.
Modern cars travel too fast to be played
with safely, and modern Judges know
too much about “accident cases.” It is
almost as dangerous to stop at a stran-
ger’s signal in a lonely place as it is to
give a stranger a lift. It isn’t pleasant to
think that you may be ignoring someone
in genuine trouble, but in many parts of
the world the chances are about even that
the would-be passenger is a thug.
“Clarence Cafeteria”: Nothing, except
perhaps the failure of Mr. Lang s bio-
graphy to appear, has caused me more
profound grief of late than the failure
of the Russian Revolution to solve the
culinary problem. All my life I have
suffered from the tyranny of cooks.
Fondly I hoped that the Soviet would
show the world what could be done in
this important direction by a liberated
proletariat. I read that the workers were
being housed in vast colonies where their
food was cooked for them by the State.
I visualised a future in which eggs would
never be boiled hard and rice puddings
served iced. Alas! I now read that five
Soviet cooks are to be shot for sabotag-
ing the workers’ soup. Nails, glass, bits
of wire and human hair have been found
in the clear and thick. One must
regretfully conclude that cooks will be
cooks, whether they are proletarians or
counter-revolutionists.
* * * *
“Brownback”: It is rare indeed for a
new coinage or note design not to be
condemned by artists, and the new piece
of paper which the Commonwealth has
made equivalent to ten shillings is no
exception to the rule. Surely the ears
of some of the luckless designers must
tingle at these animadversions from then-
own co-craftsmen, or do they take solace
from the remark which the father of
Ung made to his aggrieved offspring? :
If they could see as thou see’st they would do
as thou hast done,
And each man would make him a picture and
—what would become of my son?
Fortunately the general public troubles
little about the aesthetic merits of its cur-
rency as long as the face value is right.
It isn’t in the least likely to carp because
the picture of the King might have been
taken 20 years ago—that fashion began
on the coins and stamps of the Vic-
torian era —and it won’t see any incon-
gruous contrast between his Majesty’s
trimly-kept hair and beard and the some-
what tousled locks of the heir to the
throne. The latter may be explained on
the hypothesis that the Prince is fresh
from a game of squash rackets.
* * * *
“Biltong”: Most people have a vague
idea that Britain was the first country
to make a regular business of census-
taking ; actually France and Sweden
pioneered the way in Europe, and Uncle
Sam fell into line with them ten years
before John Bull did. It is curious to
read nowadays that proposals for num-
bering and tabulating the people were
bitterly and successfully opposed in the
House of Commons on two or three
occasions during the eighteenth century,
The grounds were twofold. It was argued
that a census would be subversive of
liberty, inquisitorial and certain to be
resented as furnishing information to
tax-collectors which should only be sup-
plied voluntarily. The second argument,
which carried even more weight, was that
the whole business was profane and un-
godly, in view of the Divine punishment
that overtook King David, about 28 cen-
turies before, when he set out to obtain
natural statistics. English legislators grew
out of that frame of mind in 1801, but
the Biblical argument explains why to
this day the census is supremely unpopu-
lar in parts of South Africa. The Boer
farmer has never forgotten what hap-
pened to David,
* * * *
“Le Glorieux”: Some of these state-
ments about foreign bodies travelling
about a human being’s internal anatomy
(B. 5/7/’33) take rather more swallowing
than the articles themselves. For
example: “A boy swallowed a small coil
spring 25 years ago. A painful swelling
developed at the back of his neck ; when
the doctor probed it he found the spring,”
I am quite ready to believe that a needle
can travel about the human system, but I
should like to know how on earth a coii
spring could find its way from the boy’s
stummick to the back of his neck.
* * * *
“J’burra”: Queensland’s first Golden
Casket, which was conducted for war-
time patriotic funds, was more or less
“He said if I wouldn’t let him kiss me he’d jump off the bridge.”
“Did you?”
“Can’t remember—but I think I saw him on the tram this morning.”
true to label. That is, the prizes offered
were caskets of solid gold, the first valued
at £5OOO, the second at £lOOO. the third
at £5OO, and so on. It was thought
desirable, however, to give prize-winners
the option of being paid in cash, and
one and all exercised it. It is pro-
blematical whether the “golden caskets”
ever existed, although one could pro-
bably have been turned out for a fasti-
dious prize-winner not wishing to forfeit
his amateur status.
“Adelaide”: Law is a sport-
ing gamble. A youth was
apprenticed to Holdens in S.
Aus. to learn the business of
fitter and die-maker. At the
end of four years he was told
to clean paint-sprays ; he de-
clined (“quite respectfully,” it
was admitted), and was sacked.
A magistrate threw out his
claim for damages, calling it
“wilful disobedience to a law-
ful command.” The Supreme
Court has now decided that the
S.M. was wrong; the youth
was merely “asserting what his
contract meant, and was right
in his contention.” He is to
have his damages assessed,
with costs all along the line.
* * *
“J.A.G.”: There should be
no difficulty about the pro-
nunciation of “centenary.”
The Oxford Dictionary gives two forms
as permissible and one as quite wrong.
As nearly as one can put the sounds in
ordinary letters, the word is either “sen-
teenari” or “sentenari,” the latter with
all the vowels short and the stress on the
first syllable. “Sente/tari” is wrong.”
* * * *
“D.J.”: England has a type of bar-
racker that Australia doesn’t run to —the
church barracker. The “Yabba” of the
movement is one Kensit, who has a
bookshop near the entrance to St. Paul’s.
His job is hereditary; his father
before him led demonstrations against
church services to which the family
objected. The cables say that the police
kept Kensit’s legions “constantly on the
move outside the White City” during the
recent Oxford Movement celebrations;
otherwise they might have done some-
thing notable. Once inside a sacred edi-
fice Kensit’s men are liable to make
things as willing as Cromwell’s men did
in cathedrals like Salisbury, whose de-
faced statues of aristocrats testify to this
day to the Ironsides’ prejudices against
rank. A few years ago the Kensitites
made a pilgrimage to Devonshire and
wrecked the inside of a thirteenth-cen-
tury church whose vicar was “High.”
Not that church barracking is confined
to Kensitites. I saw Bishop Barnes bar-
racked in St. Paul’s by a couple of hun-
dred Anglo-Catholics who objected to his
views on the Creation ; and the practice,
as on our cricket grounds, is freely en-
gaged in by publicity-hounds. Only a few
days ago,
Joan Conquest, the novelist, crashed one of
her books on the floor before the pulpit of St.
Paul’s and left the cathedral shouting.
It is an odd commentary on the English
character that proceedings which would
appal the nation if they happened at
Lord’s are viewed with unconcern when
they occur in churches.
* * * *
“H.S.”: The U.S.A. movie chiefs are
continually talking of “revolutionary
changes in film methods.” The latest
story is of “an epoch-making American
invention which will do away with flat
pictures.” The idea is that the audience
will see the figures as in life —full face
from the front, in profile from the side.
A few years ago “Grandeur” films were
going to revolutionise the industry, but
nothing came of it. I have read as many
blurbs about the strides made in color
photography as I have prophecies that
British movies will lick, the products of
the U.S.A. before long ; yet movies in
color remain much the same crude night-
mares they were three and four years
ago. My theory is that film-photography
resembles wig-making. Both arts have
gone as far as they ever will go in the
matter of creating an illusion of life. No
wig was ever built that deceived one of
reasonably good eyesight for five seconds,
and no photograph will ever be taken
that looks anything but a photograph.
* * * * )
“Mells”: Buying wrecked or sunken
ships is always a gamble. Sometimes it
brings a rich reward, but the firm which
tackled what must surely be the biggest
salvaging job on record —the raising of
the German warships sunk at Scapa Flow
—has gloomily announced that it is
£lO,OOO out on the deal. Thirty-two ves-
sels were raised and towed away to be
broken up in dry dock; ten still remain
where they were scuttled in June, 1919.
The 42 are estimated to have cost
the German Government £50,000,000;
what they were worth ort the sea-bed is
another matter. Nevertheless the con-
tractors would probably now be rubbing
their hands complacently if the fall in
the price of scrap-iron hadn’t upset their
calculations.
* * * *
“Mako”: Hicks Point (now Cape
Everard) in Victoria wasn’t the only
scrap of land named by Cook after the
man who was the first to sight it. A
similar tradition hangs about a point at
Poverty Bay (M.L.). There the point,
originally Young Nick’s Head and later
Nick’s Head, was supposed to bear the
name of the cabin-boy of the Endeavour.
H= * * *
“Avon”: An outcome of the Maori-
land ban on the export of its British
silver coinage (which means raids by
detectives on every ship leaving M.L.
and a heavy fine on any seafarer
who dares to have contraband silver
in his possession on board ship) is
that the Presbyterian conscience of
Dunedin has been stirred. Its citizens
are writing to the “Otago Daily Times”
wanting to know why it’s a crime to
export thrippences for the sake of a pro-
fit on exchange while last year the banks
shipped £1,300,000 of sovereigns to Lon-
don with the same vicious intention, and
nobodv said “boo.” Also why holders
of M.L. debentures of the sort that allow
for payment either in London or the
Dominion are allowed to sell them in
London at a handsome profit.
SAY IT WITH JAM!
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“The Millions Club’s scheme for sending jam to
(ireat Britain is receiving a brisk response.”
We have utilised methods a-many
For greetings to kin overseas
At the season of Yule, or at any
Old time when we thought it would please;
We have “said it” with one thing or other
For decades —last year it was lamb —
And at last there’s a chance for you, brother,
To say it with jam!
Bethink, in what medium sweeter
Could loyalty and love be conveyed?
Observe how it dances in metre!
» Reflect how ’twill stimulate trade!
If memories old you would dwell on
And warmth unabated evince,
You can murmur it with lemon-and-melon
Or tell it in quince.
You might hint it with flowers in season,
But, when there’s remembrance in rue,
Can you give any adequate reason
Why it isn’t in raspberry, too?
And if inclination should call so
(His taste and his fancy to each)
You may air it in apricot also,
Or point it with peach.
Warm hearts overseas you may grapple
With any preserve that you like,
But ’ware of the plum and the apple
That used to give Diggers the spike.
Best stick to the cult of the berry,
The spoil of the clambering vine,
The daintily delicate cherry,
The elegant pine.
You may cheerio your Cold Country cousin
And bring smiles to the missus’s face
With tins at ten bob to the dozen,
Or a quid for a double-size case.
Never doubt there’ll be plenty to scoff it,
Never fear but the gift will go big.
And ’faith, in the name of the Prophet,
Omit not the fig!
What a frame your good angels allot you
Wherein your good wishes to set
For those who have never forgot you,
For those whom you’ll never forget!
You have “said it” on card and in letter;
You’ll drink it in glass and in dram;
Here’s a method that’s newer and better:
Express it in jam!

POLITICAL POINTS
The Roosevelt Plan, improvised for the
second President of that name by Pro-
fessors Molo and Spoof, is working
badly, and total collapse is feared. Aus-
tralians were prepared for the dolorous
intelligence. Lang and Billy Hughes
praised the Plan, so something dreadful
was bound to happen.
State Government and City Council
(which startled everybody by showing a
credit balance) spent £1,000,000 between
them on municipal works in Brisbane
during 1932-33. Of this £630,317 went on
relief works, and it was very evenly dis-
tributed over the whole 15-mile-wide ring
of environs.
Unwillingly the Vic. Ministry has
become the owner of a large quantity of
brandy, part of a stock taken over from
a distilling co. formed by growers of
Doradilla' grapes. The Treasury guaran-
teed the co. to the extent of £67,000, and
has the brandy to show for it. Argyle
dejectedly admits that brandy is “rather
a drug on the market just now.”
As in Westralia, crossword competi-
tions for money prizes are beginning to
compete with lotteries in Sydney. The
Royal Prince Alfred Hospital is running
them with the blessing of “S. M.
Herald.” It is an odd commentary on
Weaver’s boast that the hospitals are get-
ting all the money they need from the
lottery profits.
“This is only a dummy, brother, but my
biography is really coming out. Slee-
man says so.”
“But a man cant eat it.”
It was appropriate that the name of
the Bavarian Minister who shouted that
“We Germans will eventually be the vic-
tors in the Great War” should be Wag-
ner ; it is the kind of grand-opera state-
ment which one expects to come out of
Bavaria. The most frequent sign in
Bavarian cities is “Hotel Eingang” (Hotel
Entrance). It is responsible for much of
the current noise which issue out of
Munich.
As The Bulletin’s James Edmond
used to say, “Every wild Communist has
one who claims to be wilder waiting for
his job if the present occupant is not
wild enough.” The same applies to
Laborites ; and now Scullin’s job is threat-
ened by Lang. Being an obliging little
man, he would relinquish it without a
struggle if Lang had merely sulked in
1931. But Lang put up Beasley on the
flimsiest of pretexts to wreck the Scullin
Ministry and party, and Scullin can’t for-
give him.
The Port Lincoln branch of the A.L.P.
is espousing the cause of the Eyre Penin-
sula wheatgrowers, who have to take
per bushel less than the price at
Port Adelaide, though Lincoln is ranked
as a first-class port and overseas steamers
tie up to the jetties. I{ is unusual for
a Labor body to recognise that its for-
tunes are bound up with those of the
cockies, and the Eyre Peninsula cockies
are appreciative. In a good season they
send two million bags to Port Lincoln.
Fresh trouble is brewing in China,
Feng, the “Christian” general, has come
to light again with an army on the
borders of Inner Mongolia, and a plan
to recapture Jehol. The “Christian”
general is in close communication with
atheistical Russia, so it is highly prob-
able that he is being used as a catspaw
by Stalin and co. The Soviet doesn’t
want war with Japan, but anybody else
who can embarrass it will be welcome.
For the first time for many years the
Sydney trams show an actual profit—
£3432, inclusive of £1514 earned by
State ’buses. The Minister, Bruxner,
is “gratified,” and probably he has a right
to be, seeing that there was a loss of
£290,000 in 1931-32, and that the accumu-
lated deficiency for the three years
beginning June 30, 1930, was £1,213,878.
Still, the outlook is not cheerful, because
£600,000 will need to be spent in rolling-
stock replacement within the next 18
months.
The Vic. Transport Regulation Board
thinks road transport has come to stay
but should pay for staying. So it recom-
mends one more of those administrative
expansions—a Ministry of Transport,
supported by and doling out a revenue
from additional motor registration fees,
a tax on petrol, a sales tax on tyres and
taxes on all goods or passengers carried
by road motor. At the same time it
is true that there has been a “functional
decline in private spending power caused
by unduly heavy Governmental imposts.”
What about a tax on Ministries?
To place the Melbourne centenary
preparations on a sounder basis, the pre-
sent council is to disband, and Argyle
will put a bill through Parliament author-
ising a statutory body composed of 18
members, nominated in equal numbers
by Parliament, the City Fathers and
the Governor-in-Council. A further im-
provement would be to fix the amount
the Council is to spend, irrespective of
such windfalls as Macßobertson’s gift.
Up to date the committee has been toy-
ing with schemes whose collective cost
would nearly equal the national debt.
Unemployment troubles are adding to
the discomforts of the Vic. Ministry. The
work-for-sustenance system is attacked
by the beneficiaries and the Trades Hall
Council, and a representative of “the
central strike committee” told Kent
Hughes, the Minister, that if the names
of men struck off the register because
they would not work are not restored,
“there will finally be riots.” This com-
mittee asked for increased doles: Bs. to
21s. 6d. a week for single men ; 20s. 6d.
to 435. for man, wife and three children.
Kent Hughes replied that the Govern-
ment would adhere to its policy, but
would increase the dole so soon as
finances allowed.
Stephen Morell, just returned from
Asia, says there is one country which
has no unemployment—Japan. There he
found evidence of the greatest industrial
activity. Yet, dtespite the new-old theory
that progress means poverty, Japan is
modernised from end to end. The tiniest
farm in the highlands has electric light,
transport is almost entirely on a power
basis, and all the machine elements which
are supposed to have created depression
in other countries exist. There is just
one Western element lacking—the dema-
gogue.
The hopeful suggestion of some Pre-
miers that the Commonwealth surplus of
£3,545,000 should be distributed among
the States, “in accordance with the Com-
monwealth Constitution,” met with a
chilly reception. Latham said in his best
legal manner that the Commonwealth
had an accumulated deficit of £17,000,000.
He proceeded to show that actually there
was no 1932-33 surplus, because the
annual allotment of £10,000,000 for old-
age and invalid pensions, paid into a
trust fund in accordance with the Statute,
exceeded “what was described as a sur-
plus.”
“Gandhi proposes a dictatorship.”
PUNJABI: “Come on, Mahatma. Dictate
to me. I may be able to stand it.”
“The Budget was wrong to blazes,”
barked ex-Treasurer Hogan, reviewing
Victorian financial operations for 1932-
33 ; and only Government supporters
deny it. Revenue, £24,283,181, exceeded
the estimate by £868,907, yet the deficit,
£855,651, was £6492 more than was
anticipated. Soldier-settlement and closer-
settlement tapped the Treasury for
£468,000 more than the £430,000 already
provided for to meet deficiencies, and
£67,000 had to be used to pay off a bank
overdraft given to growers of Doradilla
grapes on a State guarantee. The man
who first thought of setting soldiers to
grow Doradilla grapes is now classed by
those disillusioned Diggers with the intro-
ducers of rabbits, hares, foxes, black-
berries, thistles and St. John’s wort.
France has just occupied nine islands
between its possessions in Indo-China and
the Philippines. It is an indication of
the confused state of world politics that
this extension of empire has passed with-
out remark. If the islands belonged to
anybody they belonged to China, since
Chinese fishermen were found there, but
it isn’t likely that the Nanking Govern-
ment will intervene, and nobody bothers
about the League.
N. S. Wales Graziers’ Association has
asked Lyons for representation of its
industry on the Commonwealth Bank
Board, tariff cuts, Government assist-
ance to reduce interest, freeing of ex-
change, abolition of land tax and removal
of burdens hindering reduction of ship-
ping freights. Lyons’s reply was that the
requests of the deputation would “receive
consideration.” One wonders how many
times already Prime Ministers have made
this remark.
“Parliaments,” Hitler says, “are
doomed; all successful enterprises must
be run on the basis of dictatorship.”
Europe is certainly giving dictatorship a
thorough trial. Russia began with Lenin.
Turkey fell into line with Mustapha
Kemal. Mussolini seems to suit Italy,
but Primo de Rivera failed to suit Spain.
Venizelos has been a near-dictator in
Greece more than once; he is no longer
in office and was shot at the other day.
Now comes Hitler. But if there is any-
thing that history goes to show it is that
dictatorships are no more than transient
phases in the lives of nations, desperate
remedies for desperate diseases.
The sham fight over the possession of
the Chinese Eastern Railway illustrates
the dominating position of Japan, its
puppet State is in formal possession of
the line, and is willing to buy it. The
Soviet asks £25,000,000; Manchukuo
offers £5,000,000 ; the alternative is war
with Japan. If Russia loses the railway it
practically loses the Maritime Province
and Vladivostok, the trade having been
lost already. Moscow will probably
solace itself with the development of the
Turkestan-Siberian railway, which has
already cost China a province.
Argyle protested that Victoria Was get-
ting no benefit from the loan conver-
sions in London ; precedence was given
to the 6 per cents, of other States and
the Commonwealth over its convertible
5+ per cents. Lyons has arranged to give
Vic. a special grant, equal to about \\
per cent, on £2,900,000, until the 5i per
cents, are changed into 4 per cents. The
grant is not to take effect until the Com-
monwealth converts another £15,000,000
of 6 per cents, a little later this year.
Including exchange, the concession to
Vic. will be worth between £50,000 and
£60,000 p.a.
In his reminiscences of the war period
which Sydney “Sun” is publishing, Lloyd
George has a go at J. M. Keynes. He
describes the economist as “too mercurial
and impulsive a counsellor,” one who
“dashes at conclusions with acrobatic
ease, and rushes into opposite conclu-
sions with the same agility.” This is a
fairly apt description of Lloyd George
himself, but it is appropriate enough to
Keynes. That gentleman is fond of
advising Australia, among other coun-
tries, to go in for a great public works
policy. Australia has been doing it for
the last 40 years, and would be glad to
get rid of heaps of public works at half
the capital cost.
“Mr. Bruce said that, not to be beaten by
newspapers which laughed at him, he had laid
in a stock of spats.”
WILLIS: “I laid in a supply of toppers.
And Jack and Jock can laugh till
they choke themselves, for all I
care.”
While Depresh has, according to some
computators, reduced Maoriland’s in-
come to two-thirds of what it was in
1928 —others say it has been cut in half
—borrowing, spending and taxing go on
with increased fervor. In the last five
years £35,000,000 has been added to the
public debt by the Government alone.
In 1927-28 the total tax-revenue was
£17,145,145. In the subsequent years it
has averaged £18,658,000; last year it was
a shade under £20,000,000. Income-
cnm-unemployment-relief taxes added
£4,284,435 in 1930-31, £5,665,265 in
1931-32, and £7,656,437 last year. And
yet it is regarded as queer that business
shows no signs of reviving.

Historians, who are notoriously short-
lived, as witness Macaulay and Hume,
and who rarely see the events they write
about, have found their double exception
in Lazarus Potter, recorder of the past in
Bordertown (S.A.). He has celebrated his
104th birthday, and as he has been in
the district since 1839 his knowledge of
the whole progress of local happenings
is both first-hand and complete from the
beginning.
Harold Parker, whose art show is in
full swing in Melbourne, is a Queens-
lander who owes his success to his own
initiative. Nobody had any faith in him
in his boyish days in Brisbane, but that
did not deter him, and so soon as he
got his chance in London he justified
himself by selling his fine “Ariadne” in
marble to the National Gallery for £lOOO.
To-day, he is represented in most Aus-
tralian galleries. Latterly he has turned
from sculpture to oils, and has done some
creditable landscape work.
Viscount Burnham, who has died in
London, did not look his 71 years. He
was a pleasant-spoken product of Eton
and Oxford who inherited a fine pro-
perty in the “Telegraph,” and made it a
greater one before he sold it to the Berry
interests. He was in Australia in 1925
as president of the Imperial Press Con-
ference. Although he was kept busy
till the end of his life with the duties of
a dozen chairmanships and some side-
lines, like the Indian Statutory Commis-
sion, on which he sat from 1927 to 1930,
he was never too busy to give lunch to
a properly-introduced Australian and to
devote a couple of hours to enlarging his
knowledge of the Commonwealth, in
which his was the only London news-
paper to keep a full-time salaried cor-
respondent.
J. G. McLaren is a Parramattan whose
appearance, keenness of mind and capa-
city for action look like a jeer at the
Stevens policy of “too old at 60.” If he
were in the N. S. Wales service he would
have been due for the scrapheap two
years ago, but, as it is, he has just taken
over Australia’s most important per-
manent overseas job as official secretary
at Australia House. McLaren graduated
to the Commonwealth service from the
N. S. Wales Government Savings Bank
and became Commonwealth Electoral
Officer in 1904. Bruce moved him from
the secretaryship of the unimportant
J. G. McLAREN, Australia’s Official
Secretary in London.
Home and Territories Department to the
Prime Minister’s Department just before
the depression, and was no doubt re-
sponsible for his transfer to England.
McLaren will like England ; books are
his main hobby, and London is full of
books.
Ron H. Martin, president of the S.A.
Winegrowers’ Association, succeeding
S. E. Tolley, is a son of H. M. Martin,
a veteran vigneron of Stonyfell, Burn-
side (S.A.), and has had a long training
in the viticultural industry. He gained
RON H. MARTIN, president of the S.A.
Winegrowers’ Association.
his diploma as Roseworthy Agricultural
College in 1902, and was gold medallist
that year. He is a delegate to the Federal
Viticultural Council, of which body he
was president in 1928. Outside of grow-
ing grapes he takes a keen interest in
yachting.
One of Australia’s foremost street tree
experts was W. G. Griffiths, who was
felled by Father Time in Bendigo re-
cently. Bendigo has 160 miles of street
plantations. Griffiths had been looking
after them since the end of last century.
The Commonwealth could ill afford to
lose Clive Errol Lord, director of the
Tasmanian Museum, who died at 43
from a seizure. He was a Fellow of the
Linntean Society, the Speck’s Fishery
Commissioner, and was a driving force
behind a score of scientific activities,
which ranged from work under the Coun-
cil of Scientific and Industrial Research
at Canberra to exploration of Tasmania’s
south-west Coast.
J. M. Collard, senior sub-inspector of
the Union Bank in Victoria, S. Australia
and Tasmania, who retires after 36 years’
service, has worked in every State and in
Maoriland; hence his entry into the
leisured-classes is being marked by a
wide range of presentations and farewells.
It is said of Collard that he had three
hobbies —the Union Bank in Victoria,
the Union Bank in S. Australia and the
Union Bank in Tasmania.
Ranjitsinhji, whose English estate was
proved at £185,000, was probably the
richest man ever to play in a Test match.
His tiny kingdom was on the Kathiawar
Peninsula, facing towards the Gulf of
Cutch, but out of its 3800 square miles
he contrived to extract a revenue of about
£675,000 a year, and, as he had the
dynastic accumulations of four centuries
of acquisitive reigning ancestors behind
him, he was probably a millionaire in
sterling many times over.
Miss Fanny Brown, of Mulwala (Vic.),
who died recently, agedl 90, was the first
white child born at Albury, where her
father was the first white man to settle.
He established and owned Collendina
station.
P. L. Hart, who goes to North Queens-
land as acting Supreme Court Judge,
is the scion of an old legal family, and
has been practising at the Brisbane Bar
since 1898, with an interval of three
years’ absence while he argued in the
cause The World v. Wilhelm Hohenzol-
lern. He has taken a keen interest in
politics, but will now have to concentrate
on his other main hobby, the Church of
England. He is a past president of the
Brisbane Grammar School Old Boys'
Association. His son was called to the
Bar a few days before the father’s eleva-
tion to the Bench.
Roy Gollan, who will be managing
editor of Melbourne’s new evening news-
paper, is an old “Argus” man. At the
war he rose from private to captain,
earning the M.C. and D.S.O. on the way,
and he became assistant general manager
of the “Argus” after putting in four
crowded years on Harold Clapp’s payroll
—first, as publicity officer, and later as
manager of the Government Tourist
Bureau. While in the railways he intro-
duced another Australian .“Bulletin” —
a printed broadsheet which was issued
daily to travellers on Clapp’s luxurious
Reso. trains.
Fritz Hart, who won the two leading
prizes in the A.B.C.’s musical competi-
tion, is Australia’s most prolific com-
poser. His opuses run into three figures,
and 17 of them are operas. One, “Deir-
dre,” was performed at His Majesty’s,
Melbourne, by the Williamson Grand
Opera Company in 1928, with John
Brownlee as the tenor. The vivacious
little man has twice been invited to
Honolulu to conduct the island’s muni-
cipal orchestra.
Stevens, the N. S. Wales Premier, had
the bad luck to lose his father while he
himself was away on his first holiday for
two years. The old chap was a foreman
carpenter, proud of his association with
the craft, and prouder still of his son,
who celebrated his accession to the
Premiership by buying dad a new house.
Another son is tobacco-planting near
Mareeba (N.Q.), and there were five
daughters.
Boulia, in the far west of Queensland,
near the Territory border, is staging a
“Back to Boulia” festival on July 27 in
honor of George Wood, one of its oldest
and most popular residents. After sta-
tion work and hawking in various parts
of the State, Wood landed in Boulia in
1882, and he has lived there ever since.
GEO. WOOD, after 52 years in the
Queensland North-west. The guest
of honor at Back to Boulia Week.
He was hotel proprietor, horse-breeder,
butcher and mail contractor before he
was appointed shire clerk in 1897, a posi-
tion he held until his retirement in
December, 1931. He has one of the
finest collections of photographs of abori-
ginals in Queensland.

In the 1932 term overdraft rates were
cut down, but on deposits the same in-
terest was paid until old contracts ran
out. Returns on Treasury bills and other
securities were also reduced ; bad debts,
actual and anticipated, were the other
contributing factors to the slump in
earnings during 1932. The £3,000,000-
odd of 3| p.c. deposit stock is no help
nowadays, either.
In the year to June 30 last the interest
position eased somewhat. But the rise
in wool prices did not affect the bulk of
last year’s clip, and the season was not
all that could be desired, especially in
Western Queensland. In the Bundaberg
district the sugar crop was a failure. The
slackness in trade was felt severely by
the bank; though its policy has been to
discourage large deposits carrying no
trading advantages, the money pressed
upon it last term was actually embarrass-
ing.
The co. found employment tor an
extra £50,252, advances moving up to
£8,694,760. Interest-bearing deposits were
worked down £422,801, and free deposits
mounted £159,730. The co. made use
pf its surplus liquids to buy up and can-
cel £76,574 of its inscribed stock, largely
in London, at a profit of £12,770. The
stock held in London was costing the co.
4f p.c., including exchange.
The year’s profit, written in one line
in the accounts, was shown £lO4B lighter
at £73,040. That was after making pro-
vision for “all known contingencies.”
After handing shareholders 4 p.c. and
striking £2500 off premises, £540 was car-
ried to visible reserves (£879,184). There
is inner strength, too, in Consols
(£1,372,885) and advances, though no one
can more than guess how much tucked
away under the latter item will ultimately
be needed to smooth out losses.
While interest rates were high the old
deposit stock was a big help. But growth
in capital account slowed down earning-
power even in prosperous times. Last
year’s showing was equal to a bit under
4.2 p.c. on capital, compared with 4.2,
8.1, 11.7, 12.1 and 12.3 p.c. back to 1928.
In 1924 16.1 p.c. was shown. During the
half-dozen years to 1929 £950,000 of new
capital was got in, more than doubling
the total on the share-register.
The balance-sheet shows a strong posi-
tion :

the books closed liquids were equal to
58.6 p.c. of the liabilities to the public,
and the bank was holding only £1 9s. of
outside money .for every £1 of its own
funds, including the deposit stock.
Though an exceptionally strong position,
it means low earning-power until more
funds can be put out safely and profit-
ably.
The immediate outlook is for higher
prices and a season reasonably good.
But it is too early yet to forecast any
great recovery in the bank’s earnings or
permanency in the rise in prices. The
market values the scrip at £5 55., as
against £5 a year ago. The return at the
recent figure is 3.8 p.c. on a 4 p.c. div.
basis.

Meggitt’s are the largest manufacturers
of linseed oil and cake in Australia, with
factories in Sydney, Melbourne and Port
Adelaide. Turnover fluctuates according
to activity in allied trades, including the
pastoral and paint industries. The raw
material is all imported from the Argen-
tine and India; thus exchange and world
price movements have made it rather a
tricky business, though depreciation of
the Australian pound has assisted the co.
inasmuch as it helps to bar imports of
oil processed overseas.
For every two tons of stock-food pro-
duced, it is inevitable that a ton of oil
will be extracted. Good results in the
stock-food department were often spoiled
by accumulations of oil, which broke
down profits. To kill this bugbear new
uses for oil had to be looked for, and
Meggitt’s were instrumental in re-estab-
lishing the linoleum industry in Australia.
Lino, is nearly one-third linseed oil.
In 1931 and 1932 the co. was affected
by falling world prices, exchange, and
the slackening in building activity. Dur-
ing the twelvemonth to May 31 last,
Michael Nairn and Co. sold much more
lino, and used more oil; the dairying,
pastoral and paint trades also absorbed
more of Meggitt’s products, and gross
profit (£114,574) recovered £23,751. Exes.
(£88,606, including bad debts and taxa-
tion) took only £5406 of the increase, net
profit being £18,345 better. The im-
provement appears to have been fairly
consistent over the year ; the interim div.
was lifted to 5 p.c. p.a., and the final
was the same. The £6500 applied towards
offsetting goodwill (£115,747) was equal
to another 2 p.c. on ord. capital.

♦lncludes bonuses to shareholding factories.
This co. gathers most of its business,
including some of the cream of the agri-
cultural risks, through the influence of
half a dozen farmers’ co-operative organ-
isations in Vic., S.A. and N.S.W. These
produce-marketing cos. also control most
of the scrip. Thus favored, the co. soon
developed a wide and profitable income,
the outstanding feature of which has
been a moderate loss ratio. But con-
sidering the facilities for harvesting the
business the expense ratio has generally
been heavier than it should have been,
though some of this outgo probably
found its way into shareholders’ pockets.
The latter have done well. With the
exception of the first year, not less than 7
p.c. has been paid, while in 1929 £15,000
of gift scrip was handed out. Over the
last seven years £23,995 of bonuses have
been split up amongst the shareholding
companies. Reserves have not been
neglected either; including £57,628 ear-
marked against unexpired risks, they
totalled £120,203 at last balance.
Owing to a contraction in net pre-

underwriting profit shrank to £ll5B.
That year the co. made its poorest show-
ing since 1923. Next term was more
favorable ; exes, were worked down, and
the underwriting surplus improved to
£7621, followed by £11,662 in the year to
March 31 last. Here are details covering
the last 14 years:

Both the expense and loss ratios were
better last year, notwithstanding heavy
taxation. Interest earnings (£8404, down
£376) brought the year’s net profit up
to £20,066, an improvement of £3665.
In addition to the regular 7 p.c. div.,
shareholding companies whacked up
£4855 more in bonuses (£7413). Free-
hold property was written down by
£3OOO, and a like amount was added to
reserves. These, capital and £18,790 due
to outsiders were mostly represented by
good-quality assets at balance-day:

A quick-luncheon buffet was established
in what used to be the old billiard-room ;
results have been largely responsible for
the brightness in the last line of that
table. Though possessing an excellent
reputation and stand, the Australia felt
the onset of slump very keenly, there
being a sudden contraction in the de-
mand for high-class accommodation.
Cuts in charges were made, but interest
and rates, particularly on the vacant
allotment adjoining, made heavy inroads
into takings, while the inevitable expense
of renovations and renewals remained
unabated. The loss in 1932 was the first
since Sydney interests acquired control
of the hotel 23 years ago.
The management’s handling. of the
situation has lifted the gloom from the
co.’s outlook, the scrip mounting from
12s. to above par over the last 12 months.
Profits are shown in one item in the
accounts; no details are given. The
£15,789 exhibited for the year was
enough to pay 3.6 p.c. on ord. capital
after satisfying the prefs. The year closed
with its best month, and the board is
contemplating additions to the hotel by
extending through its vacant Martin-
place block. How it means to finance
this is not mentioned.
The co. has been very successful in the
past, £229,292 of the £422,169 of capital
representing gift scrip handed out since
1910. Divs. averaged 9.5 p.c. for the
15 years to the close of accounts in 1929.
The change in finances since 1928, fol-
lowing the purchase of the old Savings
Bank building, is shown in this compari-
son of balance-sheet figures:

Last term the improvement in finances
was £14,139, due principally to a reduc-
tion of £13,788 in the debt (now
£141,452). Alterations and renovations
have been charged to revenue, and pro-
perty items have remained unchanged at
£702,524 over the past four years.
Prospects of further improvement in
earnings, at present burdened with the
expense of an unproductive freehold, will
depend upon how soon the land can be
put to a profitable use.

These coastal concerns, unlike the big
inter-State cos., have been unaffected by
the slackness in inter-State trade and
the precarious condition of the coal in-
dustry. Earnings depend mainly upon the
shipment of dairy produce and the back-
loading of goods for storekeepers and
others.
Despite low prices and a dry spell, this
co., which has virtually a monopoly of
shipping from Newcastle to the Queens-
land border, put last year’s net earning
at a wink over 8 p.c. on capital as against
8.1, 8.6, 12, 11.1, 11.7 and 12 p.c. back
to 1927. The div. was kept at 8 p.c. ; it
was lifted from 8 p.c. to 9 p.c. in 1913.
to 10 p.c. in 1920, and remained
steady for the next 11 years. A small
capitalisation in 1926—the only one in
the co.’s history—makes 8 p.c. worth a
shade under 9 p.c. on old holdings.
Owing to the co.’s snug position, the
drop in interest rates and strong demand
for sound industrials, the pound shares
are now priced at 345. as against 255.
two years ago. At the higher figure the
return is 4.7 p.c. on an 8 p.c. div. basis.
Balance-sheet figures suggest that the
year’s profit was written after full pro-
vision had been made for depreciation
and other contingencies:

Two small steamers were sold during
the term ; the rest of the fleet is in good
order and insured. The book value
dropped £30,950, as against £29,338 in
1932. Freeholds show a reduction of
£3160. Debtors are £B5ll higher, shares
in other cos. £B5O lower. Consols and
deposits, £337,200—a fine store —were
swollen by £37,728 during the term,
showing the effect of liberal deprecia-
tion provision. The co.’s debt (£40,686)
is small, though up £10,684 during the
year. The more or less liquid surplus
(£350,666) was £34,203 stronger when the
books closed.

Those who are looking for fat returns
from the timber business had better look
the other way. This co. used to be a
steady 10 per center. But competition
from reinforced concrete and imported
timber brought years of sorrow to the
trade ; net earnings averaged only 3.5 p.c.
on £150,000 of capital for the five years
to the close of accounts in 1930, as
against 10.5 p.c. for the preceding quin-
quennium. Then slump sent old-estab-
lished and reputedly sound timber
concerns to the wall, and the market
became flooded with stocks. Thus the
co.’s mills, though thoroughly efficient
and set up in good forest areas, have
worked only intermittently for the last
three years. For that period trading
losses totalled £51,822, of which only
£2324 was in respect of the last term.
Still, the outlook has necessitated dras-
tic revision of asset values. So half the
capital was jettisoned earlier in the last
term, reducing it to £75,000 in 10s.

the debt, the book value of fixed assets
was reduced by £53,090 net, debtors’
balances by £16,989 and stocks by £6368.
The year’s contraction in the more or less

was £21,665.
Certainly, recent activity in the build-

many of the old outlets have been

How to guarantee
£1000 to your wife
IN ONE DAY
YES, in one day! The man who takes out an A.M.P. policy
for £1,000 does, in one day, what it would take him a
great many years to do by merely banking his savings.
As soon as he puts down the first premium (equal to only a
few shillings a week, according to age) the guarantee begins.
If he dies the next day his wife gets the £1,000. If he lives the
policy grows steadily in value. Many policies have doubled in
value before maturing. Some have trebled. Here is a typical
one:—
A grazier, aged 36 next birthday, effected an A.M.P. whole-
life policy (No. 110,755) for £1,000 in March, 1887. He
paid an annual premium of £28 10s. lOd.—about eleven
shillings a week. His wife, family and estate were immediately
protected for the FULL £1,000.
He died only a few months ago, having lived the full “three
score years and ten.” The claim paid by the A.M.P. was
£2,456, i.e., nearly 2£ times the original amount of protection.
The A.M.P. is so solid that the guarantee is absolute, and the
large bonuses make the investment one of the best in the
world.
Ask the nearest A.M.P. office or representative to show YOU
how small is the saving needed to secure similar comfort. Or
write for a copy of “Accept Only the Best in Life Assurance.”

Alluvial Tin is one of the few Aus-
tralian mother cos. in Malaya whose
offspring have remained on the div. list
during the depression in tin. Hanging up
some of the mines and concentration of
quotas has been responsible. Kundang,
one of the older pups, has never been an
exceptional producer. The report to
Dec. 31, 1932, shows that the mine was
closed and the quota transferred. It was
agreed to make the deal on the basis
of 33 1-3 p.c. of the net value of the ore
handed over. Under present conditions
the dredge is not likely to start digging
in the current year, but it has been kept
in good condition. The co. received
£1784 for its quota, and after providing
for depreciation showed a loss of £329,
this reducing the credit balance to £1842.
Capital is £125,000 in f.p. £ shares.
Kramat showed a profit for the year to
January of £36,164, against £29,998 for
the previous term. After paying three
divs. and a bonus of 6d. per share, there
was a carry-forward of £34,096. Costs
dropped to 2.08 d. per c.y. Ore yield was
.661 b. per c.y., and average ore realisa-
tion price £B3 9s. Id. per ton. Capital
is £165,000 in £1 shares, and cash in hand
£51,147. Sydney quote for shares was
445., sellers, at the week-end.
Changkat, one of Alluvial’s most con-
sistent money-spinners, cleaned up
£22,206 for 1932 after providing for de-
preciation. With £22,932 brought for-
ward there was £45,139 in the kitty.
Three dividends of 6d. each were paid,
and a bonus of 6d. per share was added
to the handouts in January and May.
Remodelling the dredge cost £6292, all
written off. The dredge was run full
time with the aid of the acquired quotas,
recoveries averaging ,831 b. per c.y., at a
cost of 2.42 d. Value of ore recovered
was £43,792, and average realisation
£B6 4s. Id. per ton. Shares are at 405.,

Takuapa Tin, founded in 1920, claims
to see a way out of its troubles in the
near distance. Net profit to Dec. last
was £18,057, after allowing £13,824 for
depreciation, and £6378 for caretaking
expenses and depreciation at the Ban
Pru property, where No. 3 dredge closed
down under the restriction scheme. The
Ratrut co.’s quota was purchased at a cost
of £5227. The profit compares with
£6784 in 1931. Added to £74,810, there
is a credit of £92,867 to go forward.
Dividends may be resumed after May,
1934, when the debentures outstanding
should be down to £25,000. Takuapa’s
two dredges recovered 1143 tons of t. 0.,
which realised £B3 per ton on the aver-
age, a £l3 advance on the 1931 prices.
Working costs were got down to 3.16 d.
per yard, low for a Siamese show, and
working profit rose to 3.29 d. per yard.
Cash stood at £49,674. The scrip is at

Mt. Isa milled a record 71,035 tons
during June, 5800 tons more than in
May. The grade, 9.6 p.c. lead and 4.40 z.
silver, compares with 10.5 p.c. and 5.30 z.
respectively averaged for 1932. The co.
is paying special attention to the elimina-
tion of lead-poisoning, which in a dry
and dusty locality is a difficult problem.
* * * *
BuJolo’s two dredges are now digging
80 p.c. of the available time, and the
capacity of 240,000 c. yds. per month is
70 p.c. better than estimates. At least
95 p.c. of the total gold is being recov-
ered in the sluices. Much of it is coated
with a fine film, and the concentrates
have to be ground in a mill before amal-
gamation. The hydro-electric power
plant is generating power at less than
0.4 d. per unit.

New Guinea gold production for the
half-year ended Dec. 31, 1932, was
74,7320 z., valued at £343,698, and the
estimate for the year ended June, 1933,
is 160,0000 z., compared with 63,4850 z.
for 1931-32, and 29,858 for 1930-31. New
Guinea gold is considerably lower in
fineness than that won in Australia. In
the upper Edie Creek the bullion is worth
445. per ounce (gold 84s. fine), and at
Bulolo 545. On the Watut River the
range is from 635. to 70s. per ounce. The
impurity is silver.
Sons of Gwalia’s ore reserves at Dec.
31, 1932, totalled 450,000 tons, assaying
30s. per ton with gold at 84s. This is
enough for three years’ operations, but
with the present development policy it
is likely that additions to reserves will
keep pace with extraction. Certain sec-
tions of the mill have been remodelled,
with substantial reduction in costs.

Wiluna expects to be on a 40-000-ton-
a-month crushing before the end of July
—the highest to date is 36,050 tons in
June, when the estimated working sur-
plus was £36,304 (Aus. currency). Con-
struction and equipment have cut into
the working surplus during recent
months, but from now on expenditure
on plant should be small. A profit of
21s. per ton is expected when treating
full tonnage.

cheery announcements during the last
couple of months. Disclosure of 15dwt.
ore, up to 10ft. wide, on the 1650 ft.,
1800 ft. and 1933 ft. levels was followed
by the issue of 583,333 new 2s. shares
at a premium of 3s. (= total cost of
6s. 3d. in Australian currency). Share-
holders were then told of £200,000 net
profit to be won from retreatment of

to erect a new £120,000 treatment plant.
Glowing reports of east side deep-level
developments have also been released,
and more optimism is expected to be
broadcast shortly.

Shareholders whose hopes were raised
by glowing reports on the Golden Sur-
prise and Golden Wonder at North Arm
(Q.) were taken aback at C. G. Gibson’s
report. He did not recommend exercising
the option on the terms offered. Briefly,
there was not enough ore in sight or in
prospect to the depth developed, but
negotiations are in progress for the pur-
pose of deeper testing. There is a large
number of reefs, but those that have
given satisfactory crushings from the
Surprise are small, and the bigger reefs
haven’t the same high values.

The Mines Department has kept offi-
cial reports on the Cracow field well be-
fore mining investors. The latest, by A.
K. Denmead, summarises rdsults to date.
There have been several new discoveries
that will assist continuity of operations,
including a new ore-shoot on the Golden
M ile —Lambert’s line. The Golden Plateau
has been proved to 190 ft. depth with
diminishing values, and the Warrego,
also on the Mile, is good at 100 ft. Un-
fortunately, the decline in values in depth
is almost general, but there is no cer-
tainty that fresh shoots of high-grade
ore will not be found at deeper levels in
the large quartz bodies that are likely
to persist to considerable depth.
Production, beyond rich trial crush-
ings, is slow in getting a move on, but the
field, now that all the clamor and shout-
ing are over, seems to be settling down.

While in the bottom level of Mount
Cool on (N.Q.) the values are very
patchy, good progress is being made at

stone taken from the sink showed 3-Voz.

QUESTIONS ANSWERED.
(Transferred from Service Department .)
A prospector thinks he has struck a good
gold reef, and wants me to grub-stake him,
offering me a half-share. (1) What would the
assay of a specimen need to show to make it a
good gamble ? (2) What would 1 need to do
to protect my interests ? (3) Assuming that the
assay was highly promising, in what way should
/ proceed to take full advantage of the find ?
6936.
(1) Assay of a specimen would be no guide.
The lode would need to be properly sampled
by someone experienced, and the assay, coupled
with the nature and size of the lode, would be
the only guide in deciding whether it could be
considered as a “good gamble.” (2) Register
the ground as a claim or gold-mining lease.
(3) Your financial position and the nature and
value of the deposit would have to decide you
whether to develop the show yourself, or obtain
the services of some reputable person with
knowledge of company promotion to secure the
capital for development.
BRIEF ANSWERS.
F.J.8.: See B. 11/1/’33... .E.W.W.: (1) You
needn’t worry about the A.M.P.’s soundness.
(2) Doubt whether an annuity would be best.
Investment in Commonwealth Stock or a fixed
deposit might be more suitable... .Assured:
(1) Probable that it pays no State income tax,
being a State department. (2) In the O.D. in
1932 the A.M.P. collected £3,641,571 in interest
and paid £711,078 in income tax.... V.C.R.:
Have no definite information, but market value
of these bonds is invariably below price paid.
There is no regular market, either. All are
long-term speculations... .J.N.: Cannot esti-
mate their worth. It is one of the best of the
forestry propositions, but that is as far as it
goes. You have already a considerable in-
terest; let the other one g 0... : Not
certain, but fancy it faded out some months
ago... .E.R.W.: Ask for a paid-up policy and
get out.


SHADOW SHOWS.
The movie version of “Fra Diavolo”
at the St. James turned out on Wednes-
day night to be one part Auber and
three parts Laurel and Hardy, and there
were no complaints from music-lovers.
These great comedians resemble the
Edwardian idols Dan Leno and Herbert
Campbell (Laurel is an Englishman and
very like Leno), but their humor is much
subtler. In “Fra Diavolo” they express
almost every human emotion —grief,
terror, rage, despair, even the dawnings
of passion—and, although they are
always preposterous, they remain poig-
nantly naturalistic.
The writer got most delight from the
sequence in which the miserable Laurel
is ordered by Fra Diavolo to hang
Hardy. After adjusting the rope, and
bidding his irritable old friend farewell,
he owns up to several past disloyalties,
including that of having passed himself
off as his old friend’s son. But there is
comedy in nearly all their situations.
They are even funny when they laugh un-
controllably for minutes at a time; a
supreme test.
Dennis King is a handsome and tune-
ful brigand, and Thelma Todd looks
winsome as the lady he makes love to,
and robs. The settings are elaborate,
and there is a fine chorus of bandits,
soldiers and their female admirers. How-
ever, the opera doesn’t really begin till
Stanlio and Olivero are seen approach-
ing on their mules, and it hangs fire when
they are out of the picture.
The first part has a brilliant Disney
strip about Noah and his animals, and
a Charlie Chase farce. Chase is in the
Chaplin tradition; he has no foil, he
faces catastrophe philosophically, beauti-
ful girls are attracted by his wistful
futility, and his pictures usually contain
at least one episode that pains the hyper-
refined. Of course, he can never be a
Chaplin, but he is a true comedian, and
his pictures keep improving.

You need a good memory to enjoy
Sydney Regent’s star attraction, which
is inanely entitled “From Hell to
Heaven.” The happiness of 11 persons,
many of whom are alike, depends on a
horse race.
A clerk hopes to win enough to repay
what he has stolen from his employers ;
a crook wants to get even with a female
who diddled him out of his share of a
robbery ; a hotel clerk, who is not inter-
ested in horses, and his missus have put
their entire savings on one of the horses ;
a jockey has been censured for bad
riding, and hopes to make a come-
back; an old follower of form, who has
renounced the game, is having another
flutter; and there are a gentlemanly
bookie and his previous mistress, and
others. Add a racecourse detective, a
radio announcer, a negro porter and a
couple of trainers and jockeys, and the
affair becomes as confusing as a jig-
saw puzzle.
Yet, if you can keep track of the char-
acters, their stories become interesting.
Some are finished on original lines;
others have conventional endings, such
as the one about the jockey who clears
his name and the pen-pusher who is let
off by the detective.
David Manners, Sidney Blackmer and
Carole Lombard are in the cast.
“Made on Broadway” throws a search-
light on a “public-relations” expert, the
U.S.A. equivalent of a local “fixer” for
tin-hare interests.
Since the expert is none other than
debonair Robert Montgomery, his calling
is made to appear almost respectable.
Robert conducts his operations at his
own luxurious speakeasy dressed like a
series of advertisements in a tailor’s
house-organ.
To him comes a string of people:
politicians, chorus girls and amorous old
fools, who are in trouble and want him
to get them out, Robert obliges at so
many thousand dollars per case. He has
no failures till he pulls a starving, penni-
less waitress (Sally Eilers) out of the
Hudson River. Sally wins his love, and
he makes her a Broadway star. She
repays his affection by taking up with
a gigolo, and attempting to blackmail
one of Robert’s “cases.” The ensuing
tragedy embitters him, and he goes to
Paris to forget. Then the producer, who
has kept Madge Evans, his divorced wife,
unaccountably hanging around the speak-
easy for the best part of the picture,
sends her chasing after him, and true love
comes into its own.
The acting, direction and photography
are up to the usual Hollywood standard
of efficiency.
* * *
“Excess Baggage,” at the Lyceum, is
about a colonel who thinks he has mur-
dered his general. He and his wife leave
London disguised as Russians, and with
the general in a trunk, and are suspected
of a triple murder. Meanwhile the trunk
containing the general has been changed
with that of an elderly spinster about to
visit friends whose house is haunted.
There’s quite a lot more after that style,
but someone straightened the thing out,
and a sorrowing army recovered its
officers. Claude Allister, Frank Pettin-
gell, Viola Compton and Sydney Fair-
brother look after the fooling, but the
programme didn’t say who was which.
There are anarchists in “Called Back”
also, but these are the genuine article.
The director seems to have been in two
minds as to whether he was making a
melodrama or a travel film. The result
is awful. In London Lester Matthews,
who is blind, but hopes.to have his sight
restored, enters a house as a crime is
committed. Although he hears a lot he
naturally sees nothing. Six months later
in Spain (an operation having given him
back his sight), he meets Dorothy Boyd,
and her uncle, Franklin Dyall. Lester
and Dorothy are married. All goes well
till, back in London, he discovers she
remembers nothing of her life up to the
FLASHES FROM THE FLICKERS.

St. James. BOTTOM: Bob Montgomery rescuing Sally Eilers in “Made on
Broadway" at Sydney Regent. Ralph Bellamy in “Under the Sea” at

time he met her. He determines to find
out why.
Dyall has been arrested by the
Soviet. In Moscow Lester is allowed
to see Dyall before he is shot. There
he learns that Dorothy’s brother was
murdered by an accomplice of Dyall’s
in her presence, and that the spectacle
caused her to lose her memory. Lester
realises that this was the crime he heard
being perpetrated in London. And so
back to England after an instructive and
exciting tour.
* * *
In “Hell Below,” at the State, Uncle
Sam figures again as the Bill Adams of
the Powers. The American Navy, which
wasn’t strong enough even in the Atlantic
to convoy its own transports, is shown
winning the World War in the Adriatic!
If you can swallow the ballyhoo—the
battle between the dauntless gobs of the
ALI 4 and the Teuton warships, and so
on —you will like it as a spectacle. Holly-
wood undoubtedly leads the world at this
kind of thing; and the naval authorities
at Washington lent ships and an officer
of high rank as technical adviser to add
to .the publicity value.
The story concerns the love affair at Tar-
ranto of Robert Montgomery for Madge
Evans. She is the daughter of his puritani-
cal commander Walter Huston, and the
wife of an incapacitated airman. As in all
these U.S.A. war pictures, the young
people get unlimited opportunities to
philander. Madge appears in a nurse’s
costume once, but for the most part she
flits round, uncontrolled, in the ultra-
modern garments that Joan Crawford
wore in her last war film. Girls who take
pictures like “Hell Below” and “To-day
We Live” seriously are certainly in for
the shock of their lives when they go
for nurses in the next war. Madge’s
lover gets cashiered and publicly stripped
of his badges of rank for discharging
torpedoes at the enemy fleet in defiance
of Huston’s orders. He sank two cruisers
but nearly caused the loss of the ALI 4.
The time has now come for the hero
to redeem himself morally and navally.
The Italians accord the men of the ALI 4
the honor of undertaking a Zeebrugge
attack by themselves. Loaded with ex-
plosives, the doomed craft charges the
enemy mole; the officers and men are
ordered overboard by Huston ; Huston
is suddenly heaved overboard by Robert
(a stowaway for the occasion), and with
missiles raining down on him the young
man reaches his objective and perishes
with a bang. .
If sincere and dignified acting could
make this rubbish credible Walter Huston
would perform the miracle. Even so, he
frequently makes the audience feel that
it is watching any stolid, elderly father
dealing with a father’s problems.
“A Taxi to Paradise” is unspectacular,
unfilmic, witty and cheerfully amoral.
Binnie Barnes is first seen being pirated
on gentlemanly lines in a London street
by Harry Wilcoxon. She has an in-
effectual lover, Sebastian Shaw, who
wants her to elope with him. Her hus-
band, Garry Marsh, is carrying on with
a mannequin, Jane Carr. The two pairs
of lovers come together through a mis-
understanding in Wilcoxon’s flat; he
arrives next day, and he and Marsh’s
wife promptly find they were made for
each other. They leave for Victoria station
and the Continent in a taxi while the
lady’s husband and ex-lover fume at an
upstairs window. The acting of Garry
Marsh is admirable (he has created a new
character in every film this Showman has
seen him in), and Binnie Barnes is charm-
ing and natural and altogether English.
Saturday night’s crowd loved it.
“Below the Sea” at Sydney Capitol is
Jules Verne stuff, told to an age that re-
gards as commonplaces what Jules nar-
rated as marvels. Setting aside the sex
interest, which is purveyed on Ethelmdel-
lish lines, the plot makes a good bed-
time story, for boys—small boys.
A German submarine which has
managed to acquire a vast amount of
gold bullion engages in battle with a
British mystery-ship, masquerading as a
Norwegian barque. Ul7O is sunk by
a rapid fire of four-point-sevens. Kapi-
tan Schlemmer (Fredrik Vogeding) and
his first lieutenant survive. Schlemmer,
an oily scoundrel, pushes his comrade in
misfortune over a cliff when a ship nears
their desert island. He escapes with a
chart of the location of the treasure.
Years elapse.
Schlemmer, who has revealed his
secret to salvage expert McCreary
(Ralph Bellamy), gets a job as skipper
of a ship engaged in a deep-sea div-
ing expedition financed by a beauteous
young female (Fay Wray), who goes
aboard. While Schlemmer is getting
drowned in an abortive attempt to re-
cover the treasure. McCreary descends
with an oxy-acetylene blowpipe and does
combat with an octopus ; octopus has en-
tangled a diving bell in which the b.y.f.
has been pursuing her scientific re-
searches. Of course, he rescues the girl
and kisses her, adhesively at the fade-
out.
As to the adventure part of the
show, it leaves nothing whatever to the
imagination. The audience is inside the
U-boat when she is scuppered. The
octopus-diving-bell duel is doubtless
faked, but the faking is superb. The
action is swift, and the dialogue is cut
down to essentials. Impressions a Con-
rad couldn’t get into 12 pages concerning
a storm at sea (that’s one of the incidents
of the middle section, and no finer piece
of realism ever came out of a Hollywood
studio) are crammed into a few seconds.
“Zoo in Budapest” follows less diffi-
cult lines of technique. The hero is a
sort of Mowgli, played by Gene Ray-
mond. He persuades Loretta Young to
escape from an orphanage. By rescuing
a small boy from the wild animals, Ray-
mond gets from the child’s wealthy
father a job on a farm, and the right to
marry Loretta. O. P. Heggie is good as
director of the Zoo.
Sundry Shows
“Music in the Air,” at Sydney Royal,
is still going strongly, and the end of its
season is not in sight. Rolls’s leg
show, “Honi Soit,” at the Cri., finishes on
Saturday, and there is no mention of a
successor. Peter Dawson and pianist
Tapia-Caballero continue to fill the Town
Hall three times a week. The baritone
finds “I Travel the Road” the most popu-
lar item in his budget, and has resur-
rected Barrett’s “Coronach,” which had a
great vogue a decade or so ago, with
conspicuous success. Tapia-Caballero
has revealed felicity in the playing of
Mozart, a welcome change from Debussy,
and has given Sydney an entirely new
reading of the “Appassionata.” Fare-
well concert is listed for Saturday.
* * *
The Experimental Theatre Players pre-
sented at Sydney Savoy Arnold Bennett’s
“Mr. Prohack.” They did not entirely
capture the spirit of the play. Edward
Howell was so often groping for his lines
that he held up the action and caused
some of the others to muddle their cues.
Marie Hemingway (Mrs. Prohack) got
away to a bad start, but in the end car-
ried off some of the scenes on her
shoulder. Max van Hemert (Oswald
Morfey) and Elizabeth Browne (Sissie)
showed promise. William Hume, who
made a brief appearance, showed that
he has polish. Patricia Nall, except for
a slight nervousness, gave a good account
of herself.
* ¥ *
Paul Johnstone’s production at Emmer-
son Hall, Sydney, of “The Scarlet Lady,”
an English comedy, gave opportunities
to Aileen Nihill, as a wife who courted
scandal, to Harry Farrell, who played the
husband, and to Yvonne Cahill, a large-
hearted tomboy; and the roles were
played with vigor.
* * *
“The Quaker Girl” made her reappear-
ance at Melb. Royal on Saturday, and
a packed house settled down contentedly
to a further demonstration of the delicate
terpischorean art of Cyril Ritchard and
Madge Elliott, which stales not, neither
does it leave more than a mild sugges-
tion of cloyedness on the palate of even
the most hardened playgoer. Marie
le Varre, as Madame Blum, headed the
band of funmakers with an exposition of
the art of community laughing.
# # *
The outstanding feature of “Disraeli”
at Melb. Garrick on Saturday was Gregan
McMahon’s brilliant performance in the
name part. McMahon was as persua-
sive, witty, subtle, sentimental and emo-
tionally complicated as the script of a
very obvious melodrama would let him
be. Beatrice Day ably seconded Mc-
Mahon as the haughty Duchess of
Glastonbury, and Thomas Skewes, as
usual, was realistic as Dizzy’s maternally-
minded gardener. Jack Wiltshire’s Vis-
count Deeford went off to Cairo to buy
Suez Canal shares in a mood of mediaeval
chivalry, while Lynette Dickenson im-
parted a genuinely girlish freshness and
innocence to the role of Clarisssa.

ABORIGINALITIES
“U.R.2”: “Searchlight” (B. 21/6/’33)
knows nothing about cold, which is a
phenomenon only experienced in the pink
of its condition, as it were, at Nannup
(W.A.). Last time I was there under can-
vas, I did my best to get warm beside
a red-gum log fire, and then turned in,
but not to sleep. It was too darned cold.
I decided to read a thriller. When I’d
had enough I shut the book and blew
at the candle. It didn’t go out, so I
blew again. Still nothing happened. I
grabbed the glim and had another go,
but all in vain. Then the awful truth
struck me. The flame had frozen.
* * *
“Ornis”: Those birds that hired a
woodpecker to break the ice on their
drinking trough (B. 12/7/’33) went to a
lot of unnecessary trouble and expense—
from what I know of woodpeckers they
don’t work for nothing, any more than
earbiters. My own fowls have solved a
“Go away or I'll call the dog!”
“That'll be an improvement—if ’e’s a good-tooking dog!"
similar problem without fuss. I used to
get up early to break the ice for them,
but one morning discovered the intelli-
gent creatures had overnight inserted
straws from their bedding in the water
trough. All they had to do was to stroll
over and suck the water through the
straws after the fashion of a flapper in
a sundae shop.
* « * *
“Weddell”: It appears to me that
those seals which are coming ashore in
South Australia and playing with the
cows and sheep, as well as dam-
ming the creeks in order to make per-
manent longshore residences for them-
selves (B. 12/7/’33), should be encour-
aged. With a little enterprise new avenues
of stock-raising might be opened. A
cross between seals and Jerseys would
solve one of the sea traveller’s most in-
sistent problems—how to obtain decent
milk with the tea or coffee served on
ocean liners. It could be made worth
while if the seals were trained to patrol
the ocean routes; after being hoisted
aboard steamer and milked they could
be returned to wait for the next
argosy. The shearing prospects would
also be excellent. Sealskin-merino would
take the fashion world by storm.
Further, a lot of old salts would
get jobs as boundary-riders, and with
all these new sources of wealth to work
on the Taxation Department would be
able to employ 10,000 additional hands.
* * * *
“Timbuctoo”: Brisbane is mourning
the death of a cassowary which adorned
the Botanic Gardens for 25 years. At
first it was feared that the loud-speakers
in Parliament House, just over the way,
had goaded the unhappy bird to suicide,
but a post-mortem showed that a heavy
breakfast of new asphalt had done him
in. Even the immortal bird who was not
born for death, though he had eaten a
missionary and his hymn book, too,
would hardly have got over a diet like
that.
* * * *
“Herpeson”; Queensland is always
good for a snake story, and this one
comes from Taringa, a Brisbane suburb.
Recently a citizen went out to fell a tree.
As he was chopping he heard fearful
yells from a stranger some distance off
who came leaping towards him. Gazing
about him, the citizen became aware of
an insistent tapping on his leg; then he
realised he was standing on a big black
snake which was striking fiercely at his
calf. The snake was killed. Having in-
formed his new acquaintance that the
leg was an artificial one, the citizen
resumed his chopping.
* * * *
“Montage”: When the movie business
stops fooling round with fakes and enters
into its real kingdoms here’s one of the
real-life dramas you may see enacted.
Cast: Hawkmoth caterpillar and brown
ant. First glimpse shows ant, full of
confidence and intelligence, setting out
on his morning expedition in search of
forage. He shows the curiosity of Kip-
ling’s elephant-child, investigating any-
thing strange or new with avid interest.
He wants to know whether it is good to
eat, and, if it isn’t, if it is good for any-
thing else. He associates shapes and
sizes with utilities, and discovered the
Cartesian formula of measurement long
before Descartes did. He would have a
lot more intelligence if he wasn’t devoid
of fear. (A masterly sequence here
might show in a few swift glimpses from
evolutionary experience how fear de-
velops cunning, Saxon for knowledge.)
Suddenly the ant descries in his path the
caterpillar. Evidently by smell, ant con-
siders caterpillar edible. He grips him,
joyfully. Caterpillar shows no emotion,
Ants are an old story to him. From
his tail emerge two formidable horns,
From the tip of each horn shoots a pink
whip, which coils and quivers. Then
from each horn shoots a jet of liquid—
narcotic poison. As soon as it touches
ant, ant lets go and staggers drunkenly
“What's the idea of the gridiron, Mrs. Murphy?”
“It reminds me of when I seen 'im larst.”
away. The whips are used to scare away
wasps, which lay eggs in caterpillars’
bodies. If the whips fail the second
string to the bow is the narcotic spray.
* * * *
“Gaggle”: Victoria seems to be suffer-
ing from an epidemic of pests uncon-
nected with politicians or tax-gatherers.
First, fishermen were crowded out by
crabs and then hares descended like the
wolf on the fold in country where they
had never been seen before. Now farmers
near Sale complain that they have been
invaded by hordes of mountain ducks
which are eating the new-planted seed
oats out of the furrows. The farmers of
eastern Scotland periodically make the
same complaint of the wild geese, which
make their way south from Arctic shores
in the autumn. These work the fields
regularly in military formation and, since
they post vigilant sentries, they are as
difficult to deal with as the Vic. ducks
seem to be.
* * * *
“Shabash Wallah”: Where did “Ems-
worth” get the idea that “Tamil was in
use only between the eighth and twelfth
centuries” (B. 12/7/’33)? The language
is still spoken and written by millions
of people in Southern India and outside
it wherever it has been carried by the
Tamil, a noted trader and worker abroad,
especially in Ceylon and Burma. The
race has a high culture and a notable
literature, leading in this respect among
the Dravidians of India.
* * * *
“Ananias Walton”: I read that on the
Californian coast fishermen can now hire
a diving suit, and, sitting on the bottom,
spear fish with a trident as they swim
by. It sounds all right, but I have my
doubts. In the first place, a diving dress
is not a costume for the average mug,
being as full of cussedness as a mule.
Also the slightest movement by a diver
sends a passing fish or shoal off at the
toot. Moreover, quick movement such
as would be needed to spear fish is out
of the question under a few feet of
water. If you doubt it, try a little
shadow-sparring on the bottom next time
you visit the baths.
* * * *
“Avon”: Police magistrates in M.L.
are, as a class, much more severe than
their Australian opposite numbers.
F’rinstance, a Sydney P.M. recently ex-
pressed sympathy with an illicit bookie,
and offered to help him get his fine re-
duced. If a M.L. beak had made any
comment at all it would have been to
regret that he couldn’t send the blighter
up for life. But the cadi of the Shak}'
Isles is curiously gentle if the case that
comes before him lacks precedent. At
Thames the other day a man was charged
with invading a Maori burial ground—a
ground not only tapu, but under Crown
reservation—exhuming bones, stealing
relics, and leaving the place looking like
a honeycomb dotted with pits four feet
deep. The defendant had been warned
repeatedly, pleaded with, threatened. But
for months he defied the trustees; posted
scouts and went on digging. His defence
was that he had a verbal contract to
“level the ground,” which was the last
thing on earth he could be credited with
doing. Counsel for the prosecution said
that in pre-pakeha times defendant would
have been slaughtered on sight, but now
the Maoris looked to the pakeha to right
their wrongs. The pakeha on the Bench
said “hum” also “ha,” and then begged
the defendant to restrain himself from
grave-digging for three months. Case
adjourned for three months on that un-
derstanding.
* * * *
“Corselet”: A Broome (W.A.) shell-
diver has had an unusual experience. He
was on the bottom when a shark rushed
him, and, as it went past, flicked a hole
in his dress with its teeth. Luckily for
him he had just filled the dress to help
him to the top, and the compressed air
kept the water out until he was hauled
up. Sharks rarely attack dress-divers,
who fear the groper far more. Still, there
was a case in Torres Strait years ago. On
that occasion a monster shark got the
big copper helmet in his mouth and
made off with the diver. He dropped his
catch when the line was hauled on, but
the diver was dead when brought up.
The depth and number of the teeth
marks on the helmet were the only
evidence of what had happened.

“G.G.6”: A fox shot near Moss Vale
(N.S.W.) recently was found to carry an
earmark, and investigation showed it had
been a pet in a local family before going
bush. Years ago the nippers at Warroo
station, near St. George, had a pet doe
kangaroo. One spring morning the lady
took to the bush, having round her neck
a broad blue ribbon. Some time later a
shooter was surprised at the tameness of
a doe'kangaroo he encountered and was
more surprised after firing at her to see
her hop up to him. Round her neck was
the remnant of a silk ribbon, and, taking
a tumble, he tied up the forearm broken
by his shot and let her go. Soon after
that she turned up at the head station,
the remnants of ribbon and bandages still
in situ.

“Thirsty”: As “Gad” remarks (B.
14/6/’33), the wreck of the Chinese
coolie ship St. Paul on Rossel Island is
well authenticated. Many of the crew
got away in a boat and landed on the
eastern shore of Cape York Peninsula.
When re-embarking, a lad named Nar-
cissus Pelletier got left behind. About
17 years later he was discovered and
brought into the port of Somerset, at the
top of the Peninsula. He had been living
with the Peninsula blacks and had almost
forgotten his native tongue. Record of
the event is to be found in the official
archives at Somerset.
PUBS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“This town,” he said as he sank his beer,
“Was a lively spot when I knew it first.
It will never be that again I fear,
But I reckon you’re seeing it at its worst.
These years of drought, and now wool is down
To a price when growing it scarcely pays!
You’d hardly think, now, in this small town
There were thirteen pubs in the olden days.”
And, later on, in another town
I heard what the old folk had to say:
“Yes, times are hard now that wool is down;
It’s a struggle sometimes to pay your way.
Before these times of Award and Act
We were far better off in lots of ways;
Why, in this small place—it’s a solemn fact —
There were fourteen pubs in the olden days.”
The drivers of service cars Outback
Would say in a tone I soon learned to know,
When rattling past some empty shack,
“That place was a pub not long ago.
But that was when wool was right-as-right,
Before drought and rabbits played Billy
Hayes.
Why, in this old town where you’ll stay to-night
There were fifteen pubs in the olden days.”
At last, my ignorance I confessed,
Taking the risk of pitying grins,
And asked the reason why folk assessed
The state of the country in terms of inns.
They said: “It’s easily understood;
You may see the point, or, again, you mayn’t;
When wool was up and the times were good
There were plenty of pubs—to-day there
ain’t.”

“General Prac.”: I do hope the ferret
will prove the source of supply for a
senim curative of ’flu. A blithe par. to
this effect has just caught my eye in a
daily newspaper, but this may be another
furphy. PfeiffeY, in 1893, thought that
he had put salt on the tail of the guilty
bacillus; but he' hadn’t. The germ yawned
languidly, and declined to reproduce any-
thing even vaguely like the disease in
animals or men. Likewise, two Ameri-
can workers, aided by Rockefeller
money, toiled endlessly, only to end in
a blind alley. Even the vast epidemics
of the war shed no light on the problem.
Although I have no for ferrets I
have determined that if anything comes
of this new business there will be a smell
of incense in my surgery in honor of a
stuffed pink-eye with a diamond-studded
collar.

“Woda”: The Victorians and others
afflicted by the invasion of giant crabs
can thank their stars that the newcomer
is not the giant cocoanut or robber crab
of many of the Pacific Islands. In some
places this fellow is a perfect curse to
“ ’Ow did ’ee come for to fire a ’ole without givin ’ your mates warnin’, Tumnias?”
“Caan’t think meself, Cap’n. I cudden ’ave thought what I was thinkin’ ’bout.”
planters. He lives ashore in burrows,
which he lines with the coir stripped
from the nuts and teased to silky fine-
ness, though why such a heavily armored
beast likes to lie so soft is a mystery.
This crab climbs the palms and wrings
off a nut. Then he descends and whips
the husk off in less time than it takes
to tell of it, and digs out the flesh through
one of the eyes with thin hind claws
specially developed for the purpose. The
natives have an unsporting way of fixing
him. They place a circle of stones round
the base of the palm, and, higher up, a
circle of plaited leaves. The crab climbs
over these all right, but always comes
down backwards. When he feels the
leaf circle, he thinks he has reached the
grass and lets go. The result is a drop of
six feet or so ont e stones, an a
cracked crab. The strength of his
is tremendous, and nothing short ot
oder j ron w }ji confine him, but he is
excellent eating, which is more than can
be said for the other pest.

“Sailor”* Charlie, a Bathurst Island
abo., giving me his first ™pressi on s of
big steamers, told me that when he was
a boy a big ship drifted on to the sou -
west point of the island late in the after-
w H wnrep fnr wear
noon. She was much the worse tor wear
and the tribe was convinced she had no
human beings aboard. It was high tide,
an d Charlie’s relatives decided to wait
until morning, when the tide was out and
their courage up, before investigating at
closer quarters. The ship was very low
in the water. When they went out at
1 . , , t rrir
dawn it had disappeared. I got cor-
roborative evidence from four other
Bathurst Islanders. Charlie is twenty-six,
and his age when this affair occurred was
five or six. The Koombana left Port
Hedland (W.A.) for Broome on March
20, 1912, the year of the great cyclone.
Nothing was heard o£ her again ’
Bathurst Island is not such a far cry
from the scene of the cyclone, and a
slowly sinking ship with a current and a
sou ’. wester 0 n her tail could reasonably
drift the distance. So there’s a possible
solution of at least one sea mystery.

“Trima Kaseh”: There is another side
<° argument in favor of a great lost
Pacific empire, mentioned by J.G. (B.
28/6/’33). Some geologists say that the
big submersions occurred thousands of
yf a u rs be / ore there was human life on the

of slaves to account for the 70ft. statues
on Easter Island. The cook of an investi-
gating British vessel cut one 35ft. high
out of the same soft stone with a knife
in a few weeks. Quite a small population

“Tiki”: References have frequently
been made on this page to the enormous
amount of time and labor expended by
the pre-pakeha Maori on greenstone
carving and polishing. In none of its
other arts and crafts did the race display
this Asiatic capacity for infinite patience,
Its carvings were done in a chip-tech-
nique which gave pretty speedy results
even with primitive tools, and the flax-
weaving isn’t very elaborate. The ex-
planation of the time spent on green-
stone-polishing lies in the fact that the
Maori didn’t drink alcohol and didn’t
smoke. When he wanted a nerve sedative
he took up his greenstone and did a bit
to it, in the way the old-fashioned
Yankee used to whittle sticks, or a
woman will pick up her knitting. Especi-
ally was this occupation in favor when a
warrior had a fit of melancholy. He
would go down to the beach with the
mere he started when he was a kid, or
with one his father or his grandfather
commenced, taking with him a bit of
slate. Squatting just at the edge of the
tide, with plenty of saltwater and sand
within reach, he would rub away briskly,
crooning some dirge or poem of invec-
live, and positively revelling in misery.
If he were a poet he would invent a new
song (an awfully sad one) while he was
about it.

“Kooragai”: If the robber fly, known
in the back country as the policeman fly,
could be induced to multiply sufficiently,
it would settle the hashes of the blowfly,
the buffalo fly and the house pest.
Though it seems to have as wide a range
as the common variety, it is nowhere

plentiful, seldom more than two or three
being seen at a time; But soon after one
makes its appearance other flies dis-
appear. It is longer and narrower than
the house fly, has big projecting eyes and
the domineering busirtess-like air of the
wasp. It approaches quietly to within a
few inches of its prey, then makes a
spring that the eye can’t follow. It is so
wonderfully quick that even the agile
house fly has no chance of escape. The
robber has a horny beak, with which it
stabs its quarry; then it clasps the victim
with its legs and flies off to suck it dry,
often doing so on the wing.

“M.L.C.”: To manufacture toffee by
the ton with the minimum of labor, set
fire to the honey. A beekeeper whose
honey-house accidentally caught fire dis-
covered this method, but reports that it
was not entirely successful. The toffee,
many inches thick, adhered to the con-
crete floor, and proved too hard to be
removed with a shovel. It had to remain
there till the rain and the bees cleared up
the mess.

“Walkabout”: Gambling in shearing-
sheds is rarely seen nowadays, and the
call of “Heads a dollar!” as soon as the
knock-off whistle went is no longer heard.
In the flush days, when two-up was
played whilst daylight lasted, and dice or
cards the whole night through, many a
shearer and shedhand finished up broke
when the cut-out came. The chap on the
best wicket at those old-time sheds was
the “lampey.” It was his job to keep the
fat lamps going for the gamblers, and to
attend to the wants of each player dur-
ing the night, bringing in tea and
“brownie” and rolling cigarettes. At
Milo shed one year when wet weather
prolonged shearing operations, the
“lampey” counted over his “roll”’ to the
storekeeper in Adavale (Q.); it amounted
to £3BB. A “lampey” these days wouldn’t
get 388 halfpennies.
* * * *
“Emsworth”: Barrett’s Reef, on which
the Yankee tramp Golden Harvest
stranded when leaving Wellington (M.L.)
Harbor, kept Cook from surveying the
harbor when he discovered it on Novem-
ber 2, 1773. As the tide was running
out through the entrance channel he
anchored a mile sou’-west of the reef,
but when a nor’-westerly blew up after
two hours he altered his intention of
entering the harbor and made for the
open sea instead. From that day to this,
but particularly before steam, Barrett’s
has been a veritable death-trap, the nor’-
westerlies from November to February
and the southerlies in winter having
driven many a fine ship on to the reef’s
jagged teeth. The barque Sobraon, char-
tered by a number of scared settlers after
the big ’quake of ’4B to carry them to
Sydney, was one of the first victims.
Eight years earlier H.M.S. Herald, beat-
ing out at night against a sou’-easterly,
took no chances; her captain stationed
boats, carrying lights, at both extremities
of the reef.

“Pick”: Frightened whimperings from
the branches overhead drew our attention
as we hunted for bees’-nests on the slopes
of Brassknocker (N.S.W.). Up a mess-
mate’s trunk an outsize in goannas
squirmed towards a hollow limb, from
the darkness of which frantic wail-
ings told that a ’possum at home
had sensed the coming horror. We
hadn’t a gun, and reluctantly observed
the bush tragedy. The screaming ’pos-
sum presently scrambled wildly from
his spout and retreated to its slender end.
There he cowered tremblingly, mesmer-
ised with terror. But, as the scaly
marauder lurched heavily to seize his
intended lunch, the branch broke and
together the foes fell into space. It was
hundreds of feet to the ground below, but
the velocity with which hunter and
hunted came down was markedly dis-
similar. With outspread legs and fur
fluffing backward, the ’possum volplaned
gently, struck the earth lightly and at
once bolted for a neighboring gum-tree.
The enemy hurtled down violently,
somersaulting in mid-air, and landed with
a flop that took all the go out of goanna.

“Mulgo”: Among Australia’s neglected
resources is the bottle wealth of far-
inland places. The drier the road the
more thickly are bottles strewn along the
sides; at camping-places and mining
fields they appear in heaps; and at the
rear of every pub there is a huge stack
of dead-marines of every description.
The town rubbish-tip glitters with an ac-
cumulation that would look like Gol-
conda to a city bottle-oh. There is gene-
rally a rich deposit also near the gates on
main roads, known to homing horsemen
as “gate hotels”; while the best vantage
point of every back-block racecourse is
indicated by the fine array of glassware
behind it. The first bottle-gatherer who
goes scouting in an aeroplane should
reap a glorious harvest.

“Wandi”: A vinegrower near Forbes
(N.S.W.) got a new understanding the
other night of the old fable of the fox
and the grapes. There is a general belief
that Reynard, being carnivorous, doesn’t
eat fruit. The grower found that a choice
patch of sweet Frontignac grapes was be-
ing raided night after night, though no
other part was interfered with; and at
last an all-night watch was set. Just be-
fore dawn two foxes appeared. They
went straight to the Frontignacs, and at
once commenced to tear down the lus-
cious bunches, standing on their hind
legs or leaping where the bunches were
high. Anything green was left alone, as
though the marauders could judge the
condition of the fruit at a glance. The
feast was ended with a double-barrelled
shotgun.
LEE SHORE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
We’ve rode here since the blow begun, both
anchors down an’ caught
(Foul weather, lads, to be!), .
Eight fathom each of cable run, all jaggin

We’ve give her all the chain there is, an’ still
it ain’t enough;
The bottom’s coral boulders an’ the tideway’s

skipper’s bluff
(A lee shore, lads, a lee!).
It’s six weeks since we took our ’ook, an’
tucker’s runnin’ low
(Of smokes there ajn’t no sign!);
The skipper, me ’n’ Johan, the cook, we lives

(The beef cask’s full of brine!).
We reefed her down at Melville, where them
luggers drew a blank;
We’re anchored now at Howick, where a

A-drifted down an’ died of thirst —an’ Christ,
me heart ’as sank
(The fall ropes chafe an’ whine!).
A rock has fouled one anchor chain, there's
neither give nor take
(We cannot heave an’ go!).
I howls out “Will she stand the strain, or will
the cable break
Five fathom there below?”
The skipper, he says, “Yes,” to both; Johan,
he “Don’t suppose,”
An’ grins at me an’ sings a bar of “Mighty
Lak a Rose,”
An’ me—l sees her ship ’em green an’ smokin’
as it blows
(Astern the black teeth show!).
An’ if it breaks Lord help us three, one anchor
will not hold
(“Thy help”—beneath my breath!);
There’s ne’er a whale that I can see, like Jonah
had of old
(“To Me”—the Good Book saith!).
Johan looks like a Norseman now, his fightin’
face is grim,
The skipper’s swayin’ back an’ forth, no danger
worries him!
An’ me —I toes the mark, by God! —an’ be it
sink or swim
To lee shore, lads —or Death!

with pain. Thousands of women—and men, too—suffer for years
with chronic pains in the back, and believe it is due to sudden cold, a chill or
too much work or fatigue. As a matter of fact, the stabbing, weakening,
lowering backache, that dreadful down-dragging weakness is almost certainly
due to hidden kidney trouble.
There are thousands of men and women suffering daily “untold agonies”
because of kidney trouble in one form or another. It is no use doping the system
with drugs. The only possible means of ending your trouble is to cleanse the
body of pain-giving poisons, and that is a function the kidneys must carry out.
It is the testimony of not one but thousands of one-time sufferers, backed
by our own 40 years’ experience, which enables us to state that if you will
commence a course with a simple straightforward remedy, De Witt’s Kidney
and Bladder Pills, your pain and weakness will be ended.
In 24 hours you will see results. Persevere and your pain goes for good.
Why forego the pleasures of life? Why continue in constant nerve-destroying
pain? Why be weak and ailing when you can, at such little cost, start once
again building up full vigour and vitality?
No extravagant claims are made for these pills. They do not represent a

THE MAN
ON THE LAND'S
PAGE
TH STUFF TO GIVE'EM
MEGGITT'S LINSEED MEAL
SHEEP-CLASSING.
“Valerin”: I agree with “Jumbuck”
(B. 12/7/’33) that there is a serious de-
terioration in our wool. When money
was plentiful many breeders let the knife
get rusty, as even the poorest rams would
sell at a good price. Nowadays, rams
may be cheap enough in money value,
but as sires they are often extremely
dear; three-cornered hairy brutes will
ruin any flock in a season.
A ram must not only be a good one,
but also suitable for the particular coun-
try he is used in. Do not make a habit
of buying from different breeders or the
result will be wool of uneven type which
brings low prices. And when the ram is
bought the ewes to join with him should
be carefully classed to a definite stan-
dard; it is futile to join good flock rams
with unclassed ewes and expect to get
good wool.
Classing resolves itself into a question
of scientific mating and this can only be
learned from experience, plus intuition.
Just before shearing class the hogget
ewes; run off at the race all small, hard
sorts and sheep which do not conform
to the general appearance of the flock.
Handle the balance individually, going
over them carefully and rejecting those
which vary in quality of wool or carry
light fleeces. It is not possible to do this
work thoroughly in a handling race.
PREVENTING SCOURS.
“El V.”: Many farmers lose calves
through scours by failing to take a few
simple precautions. Cows should calve
in clean paddocks only and youngsters
should be allowed to take the colostrum
milk from their mothers and to remain
with them a reasonable time after birth.
If the calf is of any value think of it
as well as of the milk supply. The
longer it remains with its dam the less
the risk of scours. When off mother’s
milk, calves should be kept on warm
milk tor a fortnight and the change to
the separated product should be gradual.
Feeding utensils should be scalded regu-
larly and feed-milk kept in clean cans.
Where it is suspected that the farm is
infected, a small tumbler of lime-water
and a teaspoonful of formalin in each
gallon of milk will help as a preven-
tive. Furthermore, at the first sign of
scouring in any animal, the healthy
calves should at once be quarantined in
a clean paddock and calf yards and pens
should not be used again unless they have
been thoroughly disinfected. By far the
safest way is to put up new yards on
clean ground.
Where a calf is not of much value, it
is wiser, for the sake of its fellows, to
knock it on the head at once. If it is
valuable, however, two ounces of castor
oil and starvation for 48 hours may save
it. At the end of treatment it should be
allowed to suck its mother, or be given
warm whole milk in small quantities at
frequent intervals.
WINTER SHEARING.
“Wen”: Owing to the drought, which
was responsible for thousands of weak
sheep, the cruelty of winter shearing is
more apparent this year than for a long
time. In north-west N. S. Wales reports
come in from all sides of heavy losses
of shorn sheep.
At Collarenebri shorn lambs have
been found dead in grotesque attitudes in
the paddock, many of them having tried
to crawl into rabbit burrows. In other
places sheep were shorn to get the wool
off them before they died, thus hastening
their death and, anyway, depriving them
of any chance of living that they may
have had.
One well-known Moree grazier, Harold
Sims, has stated that he would rather
lose all his wool than deprive his sheep
of their winter covering, and there are
others who think like him.
“Sheepo”: July and August are risky
shearing months; recent deaths of shorn
sheep in various parts of Queensland has
started an agitation for the prohibition
of shearing operations during the cold
season. The need for something of the
sort is very apparent during drought
periods, for whereas strong sheep may
survive the cold after being shorn in
mid-winter, weak sheep invariably die.
At present thousands of shorn sheep
are dying in the drought-stricken areas
of Queensland. It’s better to advance
shearing a few weeks or put it back for
a similar period. Nothing is lost by
advancing shearing ; the shorter stapled
and lighter fleece for the first year will
be balanced in succeeding years by the
consequent earlier shearing.
FEEDING FOR PRODUCTION.
“Bahb Dwyer”: We must not take too
literally the dictum that the first call
made by an animal on the food it con-
sumes is for bodily maintenance-heat-
ing, locomotion and the functioning of
essential organs; production of wool,
eggs, milk, etc., coming from the surplus
of food consumed after such bodily needs
have been satisfied.
Even where a ration leaves no surplus
for production, Nature will make an
effort to produce some wool, eggs or
milk, resulting in neither bodily nor pro-
duction needs being satisfied.
Paradoxically, the best animals are the
worst sufferers from a deficient diet. The
high-class dairy cow, for example, which
produces milk containing greater quanti-
ties of fat or protein than is contained in
her ration, will draw on her bodily re-
serves for the deficiency. Where, as fre-
quently happens, there is a deficiency of
minerals, she will draw on her skeleton
to a surprising degree for the requisite
quantities of calcium and phosphorus,
and, unless such dietetic deficiencies are
soon noted and corrected, she will soon
be useless as a producer.
For highest production not only must
we supply a full and balanced ration;
the feed should contain a variety of pro-
teins, which in turn yield the requisite
amino-acids from which the animal re-
manufactures its own protein require-
ments. No animal can live and produce
unless all these amino-acids are present
preformed in its ration. Plants are able to
manufacture any deficient amino-acids
required in the elaboration of the pro-
teins they produce; but animals cannot
do so. Further, certain elements which
play an essential part in production can
only be utilised when taken into the
animal’s body in suitable form. For
example, sulphur forms a considerable
proportion of wool, hair and feathers,
but feeding it in licks won’t do —it must
be taken into the body as a constituent
of a protein, which, when digested, yields
the amino-acid cystine.
The varieties of proteins are practically
unlimited, and a stock food containing
proteins from a number of sources gives
better results than one single meal, even
though the latter shows a much better
analysis on paper.
MOLASSES AND PEANUT MEAL.
“A.G.R.”: Experiments at Gatton Col-
lege (Q.) show that both these articles
help in making up poultry mash. The
mash may consist of 10 p.c. by weight of
molasses, the bran and pollard being
reduced proportionately. The molasses
is dissolved in the water with which the
mash is made. Peanut meal (crushed pea-
nuts from which most of the oil has been
extracted) can take the place of linseed
meal, lucerne meal or other protein con-
centrate of vegetable origin.
For two years a morning mash of
bran, pollard, molasses, meat meal and
peanut meal, with maize as the only
grain, was compared with a ration com-
posed of a mash of bran, pollard, linseed
meal and meat meal, with a mixture of
wheat and maize. All birds got a small
amount of lucerne or other green feed.
The first ration gave slightly better egg
production with Black Orpingtons, and
there was no difference with White Leg-
horns. Both breeds of bird ate less of
the first ration (both grain and mash).
The yolks of the eggs from the maize-fed
birds were much darker than those from
the birds receiving maize and wheat.
There was no difference in the fertility
of the eggs from breeding-pens fed on
the two rations.
Near sugar-mills molasses is very
cheap, and would be worth trying. Where
the birds get a mixed diet one grain is
as good as another, so the cheapest
should be used.
THE POTATO TUBER MOTH.
“C.”: Many consignments of potatoes
have lately been condemned in Brisbane
on account of moth infestation, the chief
offenders being the Lockyer (Q.) and the
Dorrigo (N.S.W.) districts. The pest can
be controlled quite easily. Plant tubers
as deeply as possible, and keep the plants
well hilled up. The common nightshade
weed is a host of the pest, and should be
destroyed. When harvesting potatoes,
bag and remove as soon as possible after
digging, and sew up bags as soon as
filled.
Do not leave them in the field
overnight, and do not cover the tubers
with the stems, as the grubs in
these will migrate to the tubers as soon
as they find their old home withering.
Keep the harvested potatoes in a store-
room where the moth cannot easily get
at them. Fumigation of infested tubers
has been recommended in the U.S.A.;
carbon bisulphide at the rate of 21b. per
1000 cubic feet for 48 hours is used.
The burning of the tops as soon as pos-
sible is advised, but in America this is
not recommended, because of the de-
struction of controlling parasites.
COVER CROPS.
“Hortus”: The cover-crop method of
laying down pastures with lucerne, Wim-
mera rye or sub.-clover allows farmers
to improve their feed safely and cheaply
—the cover crop being either wheat or
oats.
In the Tamworth district no farmer
will put in lucerne without a cover crop,
owing to the risk of weeds choking the
young plants during the first season.
This ought to apply to other districts
where winter-growing weeds, such as
Cape weed and variegated thistle, are
prevalent. However, the whole question
depends largely on the ampunt of rain-
fall received during the spring
In a dry spring the wheat will usually
thrive at the expense of the young
lucerne, which may receive such a set-
back that it may never come to any good.
It would be useless to attempt sowing
lucerne with a cover crop, therefore, in
the drier portions of the wheat belt. The
scheme has proved a failure each year at
Trangie Experiment Farm.
With pasture plants such as lucerne,
Wimmera rye and sub.-clover, the best
method is to sow early in April in order
to obtain a good germination before the
colder weather sets in. A fairly light
sowing of no more than 451 b. of wheat
per acre is enough. On normal wheat
soils it is usual to sow the wheat first with
the super, at the usual depth, and then
to sow the pasture plants as shallowly
as possible to facilitate germination. On
some self-mulching soils one operation
may be all that is needed. The stubble is
left standing and, where the pasture
plants have made sufficient growth and
progress, the paddock may be lightly
grazed.
Wimmera rye, being an annual ripening
at the same time as the wheat, is very
spindly, and one cannot expect to get
any grazing from it except from the dry
material among the stubble, which will
be found very palatable and nutritious.
However, after the first rains come in
the autumn, rye provides good grazing.
While Wimmera rye (with sub.-clover in
suitable districts) can be sown without a
cover crop, there is a big advantage in
using wheat as cover, for it will usually
pay the whole cost of preparing the land
for permanent pasture.
BURNING-OFF EFFECTS.
“J.V.D.”: The burning-off of bush be-
fore bringing land under cultivation raises
problems which are discussed in a recent
article by Prof. Worley, of Auckland
(M.L.). He was struck by the relatively
low fertility of cleared land which previ-
ously had supported a luxuriant bush,
and wondered whether the methods of
clearing, not far removed, he says, from
the primitive methods employed by some
African native tribes, might be respon-
sible.
It is quite clear that the growth
of forest converts in the course of per-
haps hundreds of years rocky, barren
country into rich fertile land, but the
process by which certain minerals are
brought to the surface by trees is not
so obvious. Some of these minerals,
though present in very minute amounts,
are essential to plants and animals —
copper and manganese among them.
These two are always associated with
the rapidly-growing parts of plants, such
as buds and leaves. They are taken up
from the deep soil by the roots of trees
and shed later in the falling leaves, thus
enriching the soil. The damage done by
fires can be imagined. The humus is
burnt, the ash is washed away by rain,
and, as Worley says, “the beneficial
cumulative work of the forest carried on
over vast periods may be destroyed in a
day.” On hilly country this effect may
be disastrous.
Our Maoriland professor attributes
the comparative infertility of the gum
lands north of Auckland largely to the
destruction of forests and surface soil
of hills by great fires. In the interests of
national welfare, we will have to take
more note of forest economy.
AGE OF THE HORSE.
“H.D.8.”: Teach it to the youngsters
this way and they’ll remember it:
At birth the foal usually has two central
temporary incisors in each jaw, through the
gums or just appearing.
At one year all the temporary incisors are
up and their edges are in wear.
At two years there is a full mouth of tem-
porary incisors, all showing a good deal of
wear.
At 2\ years the two central temporary in-
cisors fall out and their place is taken by per-
manent incisors. They are in wear at 3 years.
At 3J years the two lateral temporary in-
cisors are replaced by permanent ones and aie
in wear at 4 years.
At 4J years the two corner temporary in-
cisors are replaced.
At 5 years the corner incisors have met their
fellows of the other jaw along their front
edges, but their hind corners are still rounded
and unworn.
At 6 years the corner incisors show their
tables definitely in wear.
From then onwards the age is determined by
the extent of wear to the incisors as shown by
an examination of the tables.
The age of a horse cannot be told by the
markings above or below the eyes, as some
people think.

“RINGING” THE BELLY-WOOL.
“A.A.A.”: The orthodox method of
“ringing” wether bellies by taking the
“ring” in the five fingers, turning the
belly and withdrawing the stained por-
tion is impossible when the bellies are
heavy in burr, burr being very severe on
the fingers.
Much the easiest way is to break
the belly through to the “ring,” which
brings the stained to an outside edge,
where it is taken between the four fingers
and the thumb base. It can then quickly
and easily be removed to the correct
depth.
. The fingers should press on the skin
side of the wool, as the burr does not
seem to penetrate the flat palm of the
hand so readily as it does the fast-mov-
ing fingertips.
QUESTIONS ANSWERED.
('Transferred from Service Department.)
Could almond-trees be grown at
Nadia, Swan Reach (S.A.)? —6815.
Yes, but an unaided rainfall of from
lOin to 12in. p.a. would not afford suffi-
cient moisture to enable the trees to be
grown for profit. S.A. Agricultural Dept,
publishes a bulletin on almond-tree cul-
ture.
Where can instruction in sheep-shear-
ing be obtained in M.L.? —6707.
• No special course is available, but
shearing is included in the instruction
given at the Lincoln and Massey Agri-
cultural Colleges, and at the Ruakura
Farm of Instruction. Best way to learn
sheep work solely is to get employment
as a cadet on a sheep station.
Method of eradicating white ants that
are attacking my fruit trees? —6667.
It is necessary first to locate and fumi-
gate or burn out the nests, which may be
above or below ground. Best fumigant
is paradichlorbenzene. As a repellent use
20z., scattered in a circular trench 6in.
deep at a distance of 6in. to 9in. from
the butt of the tree. Repeat at two
months’ interval in summer. Creosote
oil has repellent powers, but it must not
be brought into direct contact with the
tree butts or roots. Soak a bucketful of
sawdust with the creosote and set in a
deep circular trench around the butt and
under, but not around, the main roots.
(1) In bulk handling of wheat in N. S.
Wales, what system is usually adopted
by farmers in conveying wheat from the
harvester to the siding? (2) Are eleva-
tors and oil engines used for loading
wheat into motor-trucks or waggons?
(3) Are suction pumps used anywhere in
N.S.W. for this purpose? (4) Where can
l obtain a small portable plant for load-
ing waggons? —6766.
(1) Grain is carted in bags or in
bulk. In every case the grain is
run from the grainbox of the har-
vester into bags at convenient points
in the paddock. If it is intended
to cart in bulk the bags are not
sewn or tied but are arranged on end
in groups, so that when the bulk waggon
arrives the wheat can be emptied into
the waggon and the bags left in the pad-
dock to be used again. If it is intended
to cart in bags, the mouths of the
bags are rolled and two skewers thrust
in from either end of the roll. Some
farmers use iron clips which clamp the
mouth of the bag, and some resort to
roughly sewing the mouth. The skewers
appear to be the more satisfactory. (2)
Not as a rule, but some of the large
trucks are supplied with a built-in elevator
leg driven from the power take-off of the
truck. In this case the bags are emptied
into a box built into the side of the truck
in a low position, and the elevator
buckets carry the wheat into the bulk
box on top of the truck. (3) No. (4)
A horse-operated “kicker” is made, on
the same principle as the well-known bag-
kicker. In the framework of the kicker
a galvanised-iron box is built in the form
of a trough, so that when the wheat has
been emptied from one or more bags
into the trough and it is raised by being
pulled by a horse, the wheat runs down
the trough into the bulk box on top of
the truck. Kickers are made by J. T.
Close, Finley, and Gardiner, Culcairn,
both N.S.W. W. B. Eastaway and Co.,
St. Peters, Sydney, are makers of a device
which enables power to be derived by
frictional contact from the back wheels
of a motor-truck when jacked up off the
ground, and this device might be used
for driving a small elevator leg in the
paddock.
How is the methylene-blue test applied
to milk? Is expensive apparatus necessary,
and can the job be done by a person
familiar with the Babcock test? —6792.
A methylene-blue solution of 1 part
in 200,000 parts of water is prepared;
2ccs. of this solution are added to 20ccs!
of milk in a test tube, which is then in-
cubated in a water bath at a temperature
of 98deg. to lOOdeg. Fahr. The time
taken for the sample to decolorise indi-
cates the biological quality of the milk.
The test can easily be carried out by a
person accustomed to accurately measur-
ing liquids in small quantities. A water
bath with thermostatic control and the
necessary glassware to manipulate 32
samples at a time can be obtained for
approximately £9.
/ have broadcast oats and planted
lucerne in drills through it. I expect to
cut the oats in October. Would Ibe safe
in putting the disc harrow over the
lucerne then while it is so young? —6B39.
The lucerne plants would be much too
young in October for the use of the disc
harrow.
Is there a gas treatment that will kill
aphids on banana plants? —6BB9.
You could try hydrocyanic acid gas, as
used for fumigating citrus trees, but this
would require a calico or canvas tent
or sheet for each banana plant to hold
the gas fumes in, and would prove alto-
gether too costly in labor, materials and
tents, as it would be necessary to fumi-
gate frequently. Safest method of treat-
ment is to spray with nicotine sulphate,
1 part to 600 parts of water.
f 1) Where can I obtain books or pam-
phlets on the eucalyptus timbers (some-
thing not very technical)? (2) Is there a
forestry service in N.S.W., and does it
sell certified seeds of eucalyptus species?
—6790.
(1) Pamphlets are obtainable from the
Forestry Commission of N.S.W., York-
street, Sydney. Available books on the
subject are expensive and highly tech-
nical. (2) There is a Forestry Commis-
sion. It does not sell seed. A. Murphy,
of Woy Woy, specialises in these seeds,
and most of the important varieties are
obtainable from general seed merchants.
HINTS FOR THE FARM.
“Wrash”: To keep the dairy bench,
table or floor white, wash with a bucket
of soapy water in which a handful of
lime has been stirred. No scrubbing will
be required. The caustic action of the
lime works the magic.
“Mulgo”: After shearing lambs in fox
country, put a dab of tar on the neck.
Reynard usually seizes his victim by the
neck, and a newly-shorn lamb is an
attraction, but he doesn’t like the smell
or taste of tar.
“Willeroo”: At least one P.P. Board
has recognised the value of the crow,
the bonus having been lifted on crow
scalps in the Dorrigo (N.S.W.) district
on account of the good work that the
birds do in destroying the white curl
grub, a pest that damages pastures and
crops. The crow also helps in destroy-
ing the larvee of the blowfly.
“Quandong”: Earlier in the season I
had good results poisoning hares with
the following mixture: Put a tablespoon
of arsenic to about 61b. of pollard. Mix
with water to a thick dough, roll out and
cut into small pieces. In late afternoon
place pieces of bait in a hoed trail along
the edge of the crop. The scheme has
wiped hares out in my area.
“Agri”: Looking over a team fed on
black-oaty hay, I found that little clusters
of black oats had lodged in the mouth
of almost every horse, causing raw sores.
Anyone feeding horses on hay with even
a small percentage of black oats in it
would be well advised to put the gag
on them and give their mouths a thor-
ough overhaul at least onCe a week.
“A.C.8.”: Most pests harbor on the
under side of the leaf, so spraying the top
side does not get them. Don’t spray
while the tree is loaded with dew. Spray-
ing whilst insects are pollinating flowers
will lead to a bad set. As sprays are
mostly poisonous, vegetables should not
be treated within a week of marketing.
Three sprayings are needed to get best
results.
“Jumbuck”: Hand-drafting fat sheep
can be done through the drafting race,
but not by attempting to pick the fat
sheep out as they come. The method
I use takes a little time, but it saves
trouble afterwards. With a long stick on
the end of which is fastened firmly a
piece of raddle get in amongst the sheep
in the forcing pen and raddle each fat
on the head. The raddled sheep are
easily detected at the drafting gate and
there’s no pulling out of misdrafted
sheep afterwards.
“Silen”: There have been great com-
plaints at wool-classing of late. I know
a Continental buyer who told me of the
mixed quality of bales he had bought,
greatly affecting the price and buyer’s
spinning value. He gave me a few
names, and I got in touch with one
grazier. This man admitted that he had
not bothered much with his class-
ing. “Expert classers want too much
money, and the selling value wasn’t worth
it, so cheaper classers did my last clip.”
That’s not the way to get the prices up.

nosing in my pocket, extracts the miss-

I admit that extracting alimony or any-

to something like a miracle, but then

“I’ve been listening to a Sydney pro-
fessor telling listeners-in how to make a
garden beautiful, and ours is all wrong.
To start with we ought to have a lawn
with a hedge round it.”
“Ever seen a lawn that grew up to a
hedge an’ didn’t look rotten?”
“No ; but the Professor must have.
And then there are the lawn stepping-
stones.”
“What are they for?”
“I don’t know, but if a lawn hasn’t
got stepping-stones it’s not picturesque.
What’s more, Bill, we haven’t enough
trees. Trees are so wonderful. He says
they are full of vegetative life.”
“Who denied it?”
“One tree, he says, we must have is
a poplar. The poplar is tall, it is tower-
ing, it is transcendental. Its leaves fall
in the autumn and appear again in the
spring. It is deliciously deciduous”
“Any other trees required?”
“Yes. A cypress is absolutely essential.
It is conical, it is pyramidical, and it tapers.
It tapers and tapers exquisitely. It does
not shed its leaves like the poplar; it is
evergreen, and it keeps on tapering, and
you can see it tapering against the sky-
line. The value of the poplar and the
cypress is that lines go from the house
to them.”
“If there’s anything I hate in a garden
it’s a clothes-line.”
“You don’t understand, Bill. The Pro-
fessor doesn’t mean clothes-lines but
imaginary lines which the artistic eye
sees passing from the corners of the
house to the tips of
the trees when they
grow up. In addition we
need an orange-tree (a
round one, with round
oranges), and near it a
fuschia, like an umbrella,
and in the distance a
clump of jacarandas, and
a clump of white cedar,
and a lattice-work with
heliotrope on the top of
it like a violet cloud;
and the garden has to be
so arranged that if you
took the house away the
garden would look just
the same, and if you took
the garden away the
house would look just
the same.”
“Steady a moment, my
girl. How long are these
trees of the Professor’s
going to take to grow?”
“He didn’t say.”
“Did he say where a
garden beautiful was to
be seen?”
“Yes, at Killara. It
has gum-trees in it.”
“Gum-trees! ”
“Just gum-trees. It’s
a bit of natural bush left
untouched.”

Information Sought.
(1) What were the first Freemasons’ lodges
in Sydney ? (2) Name of the first Australian
lodge and date of its inception ? —6973.
(1) The first regular lodge was held in 1814
by officers of the 46th Regiment. It was called
“Social and Military Virtues, No. 227.” The
second, No. 218, was held by the 48th Regi-
ment. (2) The Australian Social Lodge, No.
260, was opened on Aug. 12, 1820. These three
were under the authority of the Grand Lodge
of Ireland. The first Australian lodge (No.
820, afterwards 548) under warrant of the
United Grand Lodge of Free and Accepted
Masons of England was established in 1828,
but was held in abeyance until Dec. 1833.
What are the conditions of the Melbourne
Centenary Novel Competition promoted oy
Mrs. James Dyer ? —6984.
The competition is for an unpublished novel,
not restricted as to subject or period, not
less than 60,000 and not more than 100,000
words, by an Australian-born author. MS.
must be typewritten and signed with a nom de
plume; pen-name and real name in a separate
dosed envelope. Only one entry is permitted
to each competitor. MS. will be received for
judging between February 1 and June 30, 1934.
Full particulars obtainable from Secretary,
Centenary Committee, Town Hall, Melbourne.
(1) Is it permissible for a man in N. S. Wales
to transfer his shares in a grazing and dairying
co. consisting of himself and sons? (2) What
are the death duties on an estate valued at
£3OOO, £4OOO or £5OOO ?—6918.
(1) Yes, but he would have to pay stamp
duty—2 p.c. on the value of the land if no
payment is made by the daughter—and legal
costs of transfer. (2) N.S.W., £3OOO, 2\ p.c.;
£4OOO, 3 p.c.; £5OOO, but not exceeding £6OOO,
3i p.c. Federal, exceeding £2OOO, 1 p.c. together
with an additional percentage of 1-5 p.c. for
every £lOOO or part in excess of the sum of
£2000; subject to a rebate of one-third where
the estate passes to a widow, child or grand-
child. Federal practice is to tax on value less
State tax.
What is the sidestrokz or single overarm
stroke in swimming ? —6977.
Lying on one side, the swimmer pushes the
arm under him forward to its full length under
water, at the same time opening his legs. Just
as the arm begins to pull back, a kick is made
with both legs by a sharp movement from the
knee, bringing the legs together; at the same
time the arm above is carried forward to make
its pull while the under arm is recovering and
the legs are gaining position for the next kick.
This stroke has long been discarded by cham-
pion swimmers.
I am a ratepayer in a N.S.W. shire and live
in a district not yet well-populated. Is there
any legal obligation on the council to spend a
portion of the rates I pay in improving the
road to my property ? —6750.
Not the slightest, unless your road is the
subject of a special “local rate.”
If a full-rigged ship wishing to make her
number known to a shore station has the
ensign flying at the gaff of the mizzen-mast,
should she fly the code flags under the ensign or.
at the head of the mizzen-mast ? —6865.
If ensign only is flown from the gaff-end it
would be quite proper to fly the ship’s number
from the masthead, but if the ensign and ship’s
number are flown from either the masthead or
gaff-end on the same hoist, the ensign should
be the uppermost flag.
(1) Parts necessary for making a tone control
for a radio receiver ? (2) How is it wired to
the set ( transformer-coupled LF stage ) ? —7021.
(1) A fixed condenser of about .006 MF and
a variable resistor of from 0.5 to 1 megohm.
(2) Connect one terminal of the condenser to
the grid of the first audio valve and the other
condenser terminal to the terminal on the re-
sistor joined to the winding. The moving arm
of the resistor. is then joined to the trans-
former filament terminal. When the tone con-
trol is connected across the input of a push-
pull stage, this latter lead goes to the grid
of the opposite push-pull valve.
How are gumtips colored and made ever-
lasting for winter decoration ? —6450.
No necessity for coloring. The foliage can
be preserved by dipping in melted paraffin
wax or in a solution of 2oz. of shellac (pre-
ferably white) in 1 quart of methylated spirits.
The colors are better retained if the leaves are
first dipped in a hot solution of 1 part sali-
cylic acid in 600 parts methylated spirits and
then dried between blotting-paper under
pressure.
When were schools first established in N.S.W.
and in what circumstances? —6874.
The first school was in Hunter-street, Sydney,
and was inaugurated by the Society for the
Promotion of the Gospel in Foreign Parts in
1792 or ’93. Afterwards, school was held in the
Court-house. In 1796 the Society made further
grants of £lO a year for four teachers in
addition to the original two, who received the
amount in 1793. At the close of 1797 there
were three schools, consisting of 102 children.
There were also private schools. Government
schools were established in 1801 —the Female
Orphan School and the Male Orphan School.
In 1804 Governor King levied 2d. a head on the
inhabitants of Parramatta for the support of a
teacher.
(1) How often do steamers leave Darwin
for Westralian ports ? (2) Can a passage
be procured on pearling or whaling vessels ? (3)
Chances of getting work on such vessels at
Darwin or in IV.A. ? (4) Fare from Darwin to
Carnarvon ? —6692.
(1) Fortnightly. (2) There arc no whaling
vessels running out from Darwin, but pearling
luggers operate with Darwin as their base;
can’t say as to prospects of getting a passage
on these. (3) All members of the ships’ crews
are placed on articles at Fremantle (W.A.). (4)
First single, £l4 12s. 6d.; return, £23 7s. 6d.
Second single, £11; return, £l7 ss.
What is biliousness, and what causes it ?
6960.
It is a condition characterised by loss of
appetite, headache, lassitude, coated tongue and
constipation. It is popularly supposed to be
due to over-secretion of bile, but is more pro-
bably occasioned by catarrh or other disturb-
ances of the gastric regions connected with
general health.
What are the points of the Borzoi dog, and
what are the principal characteristics of the
breed ? —6948.
In color is usually white, but black, tan and
yellow patches are permissible. Skull is long
and narrow; neck and body long and powerful;
legs are slender, chest deep, sides flat and coat
profuse and silky. The average height of the
male is 28 to 33 inches, and of the female 26
to 30 inches. The dogs are very swift, and in
the country of their origin they are used for
wolf-hupting. They are reputedly good-
tempered.
My books are being attacked by some small
insect, a kind of bookworm. What is it and
how can I get rid of it ? —6896.
“Bookworms” are usually the larvae of several
sorts of beetles which are not peculiar to books
but infest the woodwork of the shelves and
floor as well. Camphor and napthaline in the
bookcase will do much to keep them away and
an occasional coat of turpentine is good. If
the books are valuable, place each one separately
in an airtight tin and surround it with cotton
wool soaked in chloroform. This will kill off
any pest, but does nothing to destroy the eggs
so that it will need to be done two or three
times before the volume is freed. The larvae
seem to be mainly attracted by the glue in the
binding.
How can I remove grease stains from a book
without damage to the print ? —6884.
Get a little pure ether and pour it freely in
a circle round each spot of grease. Narrow
the circle gradually until the stain is completely
covered. After a few seconds press with a
barely warm iron through a piece of blotting-
paper, which needs to be of a white kind and
quite unused. Do the job outdoors on account
of the anesthetic and inflammable nature of
the ether.
/ wish to add a number of lines, to a radio
receiver diagram made on a blue print. Is there
any satisfactory way of doing this ? —6938.
Use an ordinary pen and a saturated solu-
tion of bicarbonate of soda (baking soda). Dis-
solve the baking soda in warm water until the
solution is saturated and then allow to cool,
when it will be ready for use.
(1) / have a quantity of N.S.W. stamps post-
marked with a numeral placed between hori-
zontal bars. What did this indicate ? (2) Did
the numbers 44, 68 and 939 have any special
meaning ? —6950.
(1) Soon after 1850, when the first adhesive
stamps were issued in N.S.W., each post office
was allotted a number. The Ryde P.O. was 1,
Parramatta 2, Windsor 3, and so on. These
numbers originally terminated at 97, but as
additional offices came into existence the
numbers grew until they eventually passed
2000. (2) Yass, Scone and Junee.
(1) Has there been a case similar to that of
the “Siamese twins” born of Anglo-Saxon
parents ? (2) Any living to-day ? —6769.
(1) Yes. Violet and Daisy Hilton, born at
Brighton (England) in 1909, were united at the
sacrum. They left England when three years
of age and were exhibited in various coun-
tries. (2) The Hilton twins, so far as is known
here, are still alive.
How are axe-handles made ? —6956.
A billet of timber is cut to the length and
rough shape of the handle required. This is
placed between centres on a copying lathe, the
cutting tool of which is guided by a wooden
model of the handle. The pattern revolves in
unison with the wood that is being shaped. The
product leaves this machine in a more or less
rough condition and is • finished on various
grades of sandpaper belts. The ends of tbe
article are then trimmed and a saw cut is in-
serted for the wedge. The handle is finally
polished on a waxing belt.
What is denatured alcohol ? —6908.
Denatured alcohol, or methylated spirit, is
ethyl alcohol or spirits of wine, which has been
rendered unfit for use as a beverage, the object
being to allow the sale of alcohol for manufac-
turing purposes free from the heavy duty
charged on potable spirit. There are two kinds
of methylated spirit: (a) mineralised, consisting
of alcohol mixed with 1 -9th of its bulk of wood
naphtha and fth of 1 p.c. petroleum; and (b)
industrial, containing only l-19th of its bulk of
wood naphtha.
What were the Black Acts ? —6958.
The name applied to (1) the statutes of the
Scottish Parliament, 1424-1594, which were
printed in black letter; (2) the Scottish Acts
of 1584, passed at the instigation of James VI.,
to suppress Presbyterianism and re-establish
Episcopacy. These Acts declared the supremacy
of the King and handed over the functions of
the presbyteries and assembly to the bishops;
it was made treason to attack episcopacy. The
Acts were abrogated in 1592. (3) An outbreak
of outrages and robberies, etc., committed ny
gangs of men with blackened faces, led to the
passing of an Act, 1722, making the offence a
felony; the Act was popularly known as the
Black Act. It was repealed in 1827.
(1) Ingredients of a good gold plating solu-
tion? (2) Best metal for the anode ? (3) Details
of voltage and suitable working temperatui e .
(4) Books on subject ? —6920.
(1) Gold chloride 30z., potassium cyanide
10oz., water 1 gallon. The potassium cyanide is
dissolved in warm distilled water and the gold
chloride added. (2) A thin sheet of pure gold.
(3) From 4 to 4 volts. Experience with the
particular solution will soon show the exact
voltage necessary for the desired speed cl
deposition. About 125° Fahr. (4) "The Modern
Electroplater,” by Coggeshall, 215., Dymocks,
Sydney.
(1) In what year did an Australian aboriginal
cricket team tour England, captained by Law-
rence ? (2) Names of the players ? (3) Prin-
cipal matches and scores ? —6969.
(11 1868. (2) Mullagh, Bullocky, Peter,
Cuzens, Dick-a-Dick, King Cole, Shepherd,
Jim Crow, Tiger, Mosquito, Charley, two-
penny, Red Cap and Lawrence. (3) Against
M.C.C. they scored 185 and 45 to the home
team’s 164 and 121. They beat a Gentlemen's
XI by one run. Scores, 42 and 72 against 60
and 53.
/ have a dog about two years old. About a
month ago he started to lose control of his
limbs and hindquarters. Cause and cure?— 67ll.
Symptoms indicate paralysis, probably incur-
able. It may be due to brain trouble or to an
injury to the first portion of the lumbar verte-
bra;. Rest, enforced by tying the dog up, might
be tried for a few weeks, but if no improvement
is shown at the end of that time it would be
advisable to destroy the animal.
Does “plebiscite” mean a vote taken of the
entire male population by universal suffrage? —
6794.
The term is derived from Roman law. A
plcbiscitum was a law enacted by the common
people (plebs) at the request of the tribune or
some other plebeian magistrate. In modern
practice a plebiscite (referendum) is a vote of
the people as a whole, not of a class, but is
confined to men and women who have suffrage
rights.
Who were the Australian official war artists?
—6887.
George Lambert, James Quinn, Arthur
Streeton, H. S. Power, Henry Fullwood, Will
Dyson, Fred Leist, Charles Bryant, F. R.
Crozier, J. Scott, James Macdonald and George
Benson.
(1) What is the meaning of “terminal velocity”
in relation to aircraft? (2) Where can I obtain
information regarding conditions of entry into
the R.A.F. College, Cranwell? —6685.
(1) It is the velocity attained when the
resistance of the air equals the force of gravity
on the aircraft so that further acceleration
ceases. (2) Conditions are set out in Air Pub-
lication, 121, obtainable from the Air Board,
Victoria Barracks, Sydney.
A writer in “Sundry Shows” (7/6/’33) says
that “(esthetics” is a matter of taste —of finding
out why we like some things and dislike others.
Various arty folk of my acquaintance say that’s
wrong—that there’s an exact science of artistic
values that takes no cognisance of individual
preferences. What is the truth of the matter? —
6933.
Webster defines “aesthetics” as “the theory or
philosophy of taste; the science of the beautiful
in nature or art, or that which treats of the
principles of the belles lettres and fine arts.”
There certainly are, in any age, recognised
canons of good art in almost every sphere—-
points on which all, or the majority, of critics
agree. Unfortunately for the claim that these
canons constitute an exact science or body of
proven principles, the judgments of each genera-
tion are revised, and in some cases reversed, by
the generation that follows. Indeed, it may be
said that artistic progress is almost always made
by flouting contemporary canons.
for a paste suitable for bookbinding ?
—6893.
Mix ioz. of powdered alum with |lb. of
plain flour and stir in enough water to form
a thin paste. Add a pint of cold water and
heat slowly in an enamel container. Stir con-
tinually until it boils and continue to stir rapidly
for five minutes after boiling. Before using
beat up well each time with a flat stick.
Meaning of the word “carat” as applied to
gold ? —7033.
The composition of gold, as applied in jewel-
lery, is measured in carats, 24 carats being the
pure metal. If the alloy consists of 20 parts
of pure gold and 4 parts of copper it is re-
ferred to as 20-carat gold. Eighteen-carat gold
is equivalent to 18 parts of gold and 6 of
copper; 14 carat to 14 parts of gold and 10
of copper, etc.
What ten countries lead in the production of
petroleum, and what is their annual output ?
6965.
The figures for 1932 are: U.S.A., 785,304,000
barrels; Russia, 149,841,000; Venezuela,
119,110,000; Roumania, 50,453,000; Persia,
45,283,000: Dutch East Indies, 39,528.000;
Mexico, 32,474.000; Colombia, 16,249,000;
Argentina, 13,278.000, and Trinidad, 10,014.
Seven barrels equal one ton.
What is an anemometer and how does it
work*? —6980.
It is an instrument for measuring the velocity
of the wind. In the Robinson type four hemi-
spherical cups are fixed on four arms at right
angles, so that their concave surfaces are in
the same direction of rotation. The motion
imparted by the wind is translated by a series
of cogwheels so as to indicate miles per hour.
The Dines or tube anemometer consists of two
tubes, one of which has an open mouth kept
facing the wind by a vane as in a weather-
cock. Increases in pressure are communicated
down this tube to a recording apparatus. The
other tube is perforated with small holes
arranged in rings so that suction, or a decrease
in pressure, is produced by the wind passing
across the holes. The decrease in pressure is
also communicated to the recording apparatus,
which consists of a float in a closed vessel,
so arranged that when the wind is blowing the
increased pressure in the first tube is applied
underneath the float raising it in the water,
and the decreased pressure is communicated to
the air above the float, also tending to raise it.
The movements of the float are registered
graphically on a slowly revolving drum.

Miss Madge Elliott,
Mr. Cyril Ritchard,
and
Mr. John Moore
are just a few of the
many world-famous
stars who use and
recommend
HEENZO
as a money-saving
remedy for chest and
throat ailments.
é
ê
Here’s a wonderful money-saving recipe for a family cough mixture that is equally good for
children and adults, and is far better than the usual made-up cough mixture you could buy. Order
from your chemist or store a two-shilling bottle of concentrated HEENZO. Add the Heenzo to
sweetened water, according to the easy directions on the bottle, and you will have a supply equal
to eight ordinary-sized bottles of the usual ready-mixed cough remedies that would cost up to £l.
Heenzo does NOT contain any poisons or harmful drugs. Therefore, it can be given with perfect
safety to the youngest baby. You will be delighted with the speedy way HEENZO soothes sore
throats, eases the chest, and banishes coughs, colds, croup, influenza, bronchitis, and whooping
cough. Always have Heenzo ready in the home for the first sign of a cough or cold. Remember,
an ounce of prevention is better than a ton of cure.
Every Leading Chemist and Store in Australia sells
HEENZO, the famous money-saving remedy for
COUGHS, corns,
CROUP, BRONCHITIS AND INFLUENZA

SPORTING
NOTIONS
Under the Whip
Two Australian Hurdle candidates, Far-
lure (first) and Pitoota (third), showed up
in the Ballater Hurdle at Moonee Valley.
They shared favoritism. Pitoota, who
conceded Farlure 171 b., had the services
of Bob Inkson; but even a champion
jockey cannot come home without the
horse. Pitoota found the pace too warm
in the first half of the journey; he
finished gamely, two lengths behind Dis-
ney, who lost to Farlure by a neck after
a tough struggle, in which whips were
vigorously used. Ithuriel shaped wretch-
edly and Purple Cap fell. They can be
dismissed from calculations on the big
hurdle race at Caulfield on August 5.
The long journey may suit Pitoota better
than Farlure, although the latter has
comparative youth on his side and is
making rapid improvement as a jumper.
The Boiardo Steeplechase had practi-
cally no bearing on the Australian
Steeplechase; of the 15 runners only
two were entered for what used to be
known as the “four-miler.” Prince
Flaviol created rather a good impression
by leading by four lengths from Dongola
at the five-furlongs pole, but Inkson
had been riding a waiting race on the
favorite and his mount romped home.
Dongola is owned by G. A. Watkins,
the butcher. His stable-companion, Ton-
galla, landed the Hunters’ Steeplechase
earlier in the afternoon. Fred Hoysted

is almost invincible with jumpers; he
annexed the Grand National Steeple-
chase recently with Redditch. At the
“National” meeting Dongola was beaten
by C'oorong in the Hunters’ Cup. He
did not take the Flemington fences well,
but the Valley country occasioned him
little trouble.
Jack Holt took the Warroona Handi-
cap (six furlongs) with Press Gang and
the Compensation Handicap (9y fur-
longs) with Picatus. Owned by A. T.
Craig, Press Gang is by The Night Patrol
from the dam of Umbertana, now being
educated as a hurdler by H. W. Gabell.
Press Gang and Picatus were hot favor-
ites, and their backers experienced no.
anxiety in running, though the W.A.
prad Alienist came home strongly, half
a length behind Picatus. Last spring
Picatus was strongly fancied for the
Caulfield Cup, but did not do himself
justice. He was never in such good fettle
as at present. Picatus is by Magpie (sire
of Windbag) from Medal Queen, by
Shepherd King from Lady Medallist.
Gallantic was first choice for the St.
Mongo Handicap. The Heroic mare
again galloped kindly for Frank Demp-
sey and headed Grenadier as they faced
for home, but she tired and missed a
place. Grenadier dead-heated for first
with the consistent Gay King, while Sea-
brae, an outsider, was only a neck
farther off.
Generally speaking, punters had a
profitable time at Moonee Valley, but
they misfired badly over the Northwood
Welter. At Geelong on July 12 King of
Night was unlucky to lose his division
of the Novice Handicap. Because of
this the Adelaide gelding opened favorite
and remained so until a last-minute rush
came for Prince Leo, who shortened
from 7 to 1 to half those odds. King
of Night and Prince Leo each claim
Spearhead as sire. The former dashed
away in the lead, but Prince Leo obtained
his measure at the home turn and looked
to have the race in his keeping until-
Cape Don put in a late claim ; Cape Don
scored on the post by half a neck. He
hails from Adelaide, where he has won
over hurdles. McShortodds had been
willing to lay 50 to 1 against Cape Don,
whose tote div. was at the rate of over
78 to 1.
Melbourne race clubs have com-
menced, to use loud speakers for the
broadcasting of their sport in the differ-
ent enclosures. Williamstown set the
ball rolling; Flemington, Caulfield and
Moonee Valley have followed suit.
Down-the-line courses doubtless will
come into line, but Ascot, where pony
racing is concentrated, prohibits broad-
casting in any form. Wherever intro-
duced the innovation is appreciated, as
the bulk of spectators cannot distinguish
the colors of jockeys at a distance.
* * * *
Canterbury Park trainers were in good
form at the Moorefield meeting. They
won the hurdle race with Hustler (who
has had about six trainers), the two-year-
old event with Gayhawk and the Hurst-
ville Mile with Moallin. Riding tactics
contributed greatly to Moallin’s success.
While the apprentices on Dunerc and
Treasury were instructed to make every
post a winner, jockey Cout'ts waited until
the tactics settled both pacemakers.
Second to Moallin was Wicklow, who
carries the colors of Cavedweller.
Randwick trainer Kelso was a fine
horseman in his day, and he generally
has a promising apprentice in his stable.
He was delighted with the effort of his
lad, Parr, when that youth landed
Remeta a winner of the Kogarah Stakes.
After passing the three-furlongs pole, the
pacemaker, Knight of the Bow, who is to
be given a chance to win over the brush
hurdles, was rolling badly. When he
shifted out, little Parr sent Remeta
through on the rails. The Rossendale
mare just scraped home from the New-
castle-owned and -trained Opera Pie, who
lost ground through being on the outside
nearly all the way.
The sportsman who races as “G.
Torrance”—he is well known in the boot
trade —did not have much luck with old
Inducement. He has a useful sprinter in
the Heroic gelding King Pin, who is out
of Blue Dome, by The Welkin. King
Pin was in luck’s way in the Moorefield
flying Handicap, as the favorite, Mul-
tudo, was out of the race when the bar-
rier was released, owing to colliding with
another runner. King Pin, getting a fine
run on the rails when . King Moab
dropped out, went on to win from Ques-
tionnaire and Pasticcio.
4 Magnetic won last year’s Villiers
Stakes with Bst. 21b., and with 10 pounds
more he was favorably handicapped in
the Moorefield Handicap. Wallace
Mimi’s withdrawal made it easier for
Magnetic, he being opposed to five
moderates, yet the bookmakers laid 5 to
2 against him. Magnetic’s class pulled
him through when it came to racing.
McCarten sat still until half a mile
from home, and driving the son of
Rossendale on the rails to the turn,
decided to go round the leaders when
heads were turned for home. Magnetic
shifted out but he won nicely from Craig-
aven and Fine Salt. The pacemaker,
Princess Cistercian, was a good fourth,
but the locally-trained Sailing cut up
badly. He was beaten half a mile from
home.

M.Q. (and Rafferty) Rules
The Leichhardt referee came in for
criticism when Penchiff met Lurich. More
than once in the crowd’s opinion the Bul-
garian’s scissors hold pinned Lurich’s
shoulders for the required three seconds,
but McMaster thought differently. The
official collected more hooting for award-
ing Lurich a fall in the fourth. Lurich
won —not that it matters a cent.
Footbrawl
The struggle for fourth place in the
Vic. League continues and every Satur-
day sees a new occupant. Last week-end
30,000 watched South Melbourne gallop
over Footscray at ’Scray, to the tune of
129 points to 59, the Red-and-Whites
being faster, surer and more systematic.
Diggins and Reville, followers, and Pratt,
forward, put it all over the locals. Simul-
taneously, 25,000 pushed into Victoria
Park to watch- Collingwood crush Fitz-
roy. ’Wood had all the best of the play
but couldn’t kick goals, and as the time-
keepers were reaching for the bell the
’Woodmen owned 7 goals 21 behinds —
63 points—to ’Roy’s 9-9 —63 also. Then
Smallhorn grabbed the ball, tore round
the forward wing and booted a behind
for ’Roy —64 to ’Wood’s 63. It was only
one point, but it virtually puts ’Wood
out of the final four—the first time in
10 years. Geelong held Melbourne com-
fortably, with 123 points to 88 ; Haw-
thorn, as usual, had the better of the
game against Carlton until the last quar-
ter, and then faded away: Carlton, 98
points ; Hawthorn, 74. Richmond fin-
ished a practice match against North
Melbourne with 131 points to 56, and
St. Kilda beat Essendon with 92 points
to 87.
* * # *
The Wallabies won the second Test
against South Africa at Durban by 21-6
—four tries, three converted, and a p.g. to
a try and a p.g. Following on the news
that the forwards had beaten the solid
O.F.S. pack a few days earlier, and con-
sidering that final cables from manager
Mathews were full of confidence, a win
was not unexpected, but the wide margin
came as a surprise. The necessity for
completely altering our style of forward
play during the tour has proved a handi-
cap, but cables show the Afrikanders were
fairly matched at their own game. Out-
backs, getting the ball and with room to
move, seem to have done the rest. The
return of Hodgson and Louden to the
forwards, after injuries, and the sparkling
play of scrum-half Bennett and winger
Kelaher had much to do with the win.
South Africa lost a forward in the second
spell, but as scores were already 16-6 it
could not have made much difference.
Our side, with seven Queenslanders, two
Victorians and six N. S. Wales men, was
the most representative that has appeared
for Australia. This is the third time in
four meetings that Australia has downed
the ’Boks, the A.I.F. side having done
the trick twice. The next Test is at
Jo’burg, on August 12.
* * * *
The Rugby Union grade matches in
Sydney provided one turn-up when the
solid, hard-rucking Northern Suburbs
forwards taught Randwick that clever
back play is not everything in Rugby
football. Scores were 19-6 against Rand-
wick when the lesson was over at North
Sydney Oval. North scored four tries,
converted two and scored a p.g. Rand-
wick got two p.g.’s. On its home ground
University beat Drummoyne comfortably
by 12-3. Manly was too heavy and
clever for St. George at the Village and
won 30-3, while Eastern Suburbs, after
leading into the second spell, was beaten
14-11 by Western.
*,* * *
South Australia, the baby of Australian
Rugby Unions, covered itself with glory
in its first inter-State match played
against Victoria at Adelaide. The home
side went down fighting, being beaten
by a last-minute try when in the lead.
The final scores were 21-19 in Victoria’s
favor. The Vies, sent over their best
side, and N.S.W. has good reason to
know how strong that is. Many of the
S.A. players were Australian Rulers last
season.
* * * *
The St. Joseph lads were all at sea
in their match against Shore in the fourth
round of Sydney G.P.S. competition. It
was unusual to see Joeys’ back line un-
certain, the “spoiling” tactics of Shore
being responsible. Final scores were 6-6:
Joeys, a try and a penalty goal ; Shore,
two penalty goals. The other matches
resulted in wins for King’s, Newington
amd Grammar.
* * * *
The Rugby League fixtures again
showed reversals of form. At the Syd-
ney Sports Ground St. George figured in
another saddening exhibition in which
it defeated South Sydney by 11 to 4.
The result brings South and St. George
together at the head of the League
table. At Drummoyne, Balmain checked
University’s aspirations by 12-10, and in
the first-grade match under the profes-
sional code ever staged at Chatswood
Oval Eastern Suburbs beat North Sydney
20-3. At Pratten Park Newtown won
from Western Suburbs 18-5 by charac-
teristic bullocking methods.
(Continued on page 30.)
Racquet and Bawl
England followed up the Davis Cup
win from Australia in the European zone
by convincingly defeating America at
Paris for the right to challenge France
for the Cup. In the opening singles
Austin downed Vines 6-1, 6-1, 6-4, and
Perry backed this up by outing Allison
6-1, 7-5, 6-4. The Americans took the
doubles, Lott and Van Ryn beating
Perry and Hughes 8-6, 6-4, 6-1. Austin
then won the match by defeating Allison
by three sets to one. When the Perry-
Vines contest was in the fifth set, with
scores two sets all, the American col-
lapsed and had to be carried off.
* * * *
“Cut Shot”: Though the Davis Cup is
34 years old —Dwight Davis got the idea
of donating it in 1900 —it has been played
for only 27 times. Britain and America
were the only starters for the first meet-
ing, Britain winning in 1903 and keeping
it until 1907. In that year Norman
Brookes and Tony Wilding won for Aus-
tralasia, and the cup stayed south of the
line until 1911. From 1920 M.L. and this
country have gone on their own. America
has had the most use of the pot with 10
wins. Australia and France are level
with six, and Britain has won five times.
* * * *
“Hotham”: The annual meeting of
the Australian tennis heads in Melbourne
showed that there was a loss of £370 on
the Americans’ tour. The offer of
the Daphne Akhurst memorial cup from
the N.S.W. tennis authorities was
accepted, and this will be a perpetual
trophy for the women’s singles cham-
pionship of Australia, the winners re-
ceiving a replica each year. Since West-
ralia was cut out of the i\merican
itinerary after the Gropers had gone to
a lot of expense in preparing for the
visit, it was decided to allow the West-
ralian body to keep the £125 taken from
the Davis Cup team’s games in Perth.

Footbrawl
“Rover”: The coming Australian
Rules Carnival in Sydney will go down in
football history as the pivot for one of
the most unabashed advertising stunts in
connection with the game. Everyone
familiar with the conditions of both
games knows that the proposed amal-
gamation of the Rugby League and Aus-
tralian League codes is an impossibility.
The only result will be an influx of
Rugby League spectators to have a look
at the “Melbourne game” during the car-
nival. This will mean augmented gates,
and the N.S.W. League deserves what
credit is coming to it for its unselfish
assistance in professing to back up the
proposed amalgamation farce. Queens-
land Rugby League, an indispensable
partner with N.S.W. in maintaining the
professional Rugby code in Australia, has
officially declined to have anything to do
with the absurdity.
* * lie
Up to the second Test with South
Africa the Wallabies had won half of the
12 matches played of their programme
of 23. The performance is on the disap-
pointing side, but in view of the loss of
players like Ross, Louden, Hodgson and
Malcolm for most of the games the team
can hardly be blamed, especially as the
entire style of play had to be remodelled
to conform with the close-rucking South
African game. In the 12 games the
tourists scored 33 tries, of which only 15
were converted. Indeed, the goal-kicking
generally has fallen short of expectations.
* * * *
“Stand Off”: Though their playing
record cannot compare with that of the
Waratahs in Britain, the Wallabies in
South Africa seem to have lived up to
their predecessors’ reputation as an extra-
likeable lot on the field and off. Papers
and private correspondents join generally
in emphatic praise of what some of them
frankly admit has come as a surprise.
It is a good reputation to have anywhere,
and nowhere more than in South Africa,
where the Australian has been unpopular.
* * * *
“Der Jong”: The Wallabies struck one
unexpected handicap when they played
their first game at Jo’burg—the altitude,
which is somewhere about 7000 feet
above sea level. Says the Rand “Daily
Mail” of June 12, “This played havoc
with their energy and the forwards par-
ticularly moved as though their feet were
held in glue—foot-weary and struggling
for breath, they could not get up in time
to support the breakaways by their backs.”
We should note this and give the next
team we send to South Africa a week’s
preliminary training on the top of Mt.
Kosciusko.
* * * *
“Outside Right”: Australian Soccer,
which has a strong Scottish flavor, is
wallowing in sackcloth and ashes at the
thought of its loss of £550 over the recent
tour of the Maoriland team in N.S.W.
and Queensland. In N.S.W. club mem-
bers have been aroused to a fine Caledon-
ian fury by a proposed levy to foot the
debit, each club being rated for a £2O
sub. An Australian team is to go to
New Caledonia shortly, and it is hoped
will help by playing a match against the
Rest of Australia before starting.
The Nineteenth Hole
“Divot Digger”: The first sweet har-
bingers of early spring in Australia nowa-
days are the ball-stealing crows. Pos-
sibly the advent of nesting-time causes
the crow to confuse the things with eggs.
At Binalong (N.S.W.), a loss of over 50
new balls has been debited to the crows
in the opening week of the season. It
is always the new ball which attracts.
The cut and discolored article is scorned.
Many players have taken to running after
their drives as soon as the ball leaves
the tee, shouting ferociously the while.
This, while it has saved only a few balls,
has had an excellent slimming effect
among the members.
“Hoylake”: The burning question of
what expenses may be paid to amateur
golfers representing their country or club
without jolting their amateur status in-
duced the N.S.W. Golf Council to refer
the matter to St. Andrews some time ago.
The answer states that travelling exes, and
hotel bills may be paid, and while players
may engage in other competitions before
the big stuff', this should not be encour-
aged. Expenses should only be allowed
up to the time of the principal match.
This will cut out the pothunters, who get
a free trip as members of an official team
and pick up baksheesh in non-official
handicaps and other oddments offering.
* ■ * * *
“Sandringham”: This year’s Austra-
lian open championship meeting starts
at Royal Melbourne on September 2,
entries dosing a fortnight earlier. On
the opening day a stroke handicap and
a professional competition will be staged,
together with the foursomes, Ivo Whit-
ton and Len Nettlefold being the title-
holders. On September 5, the inter-
state match takes place. The bigger
stuff begins two days later, with the first
stroke rounds of the open. The 60 left
in will be eligible for the third and
fourth rounds, provided at least 24
amateurs are quali-
fied for them. The
matches for the
amateur and pro-
fessional titles be-
gin on September
11, and the finals
are down for
Thursday, Septem-
ber 14. Title-
holders are: Open,
M. J. Ryan ama-
teur, R. J. Betting-
ton ; professional,
F. Macmahon.
❖ * *
“Lardine”: That
bodylining feeling
seems to be shov-
ing into golf. The
N. golf pan-
jandrums are per-
turbed at the dis-
covery that golfing
disputes are lead-
ing some players
“to lose sight of
that indefinable
spirit of the game
which is most
essential.” A con-
ference of club
captains and offi-
cials is to be
formed “with the
idea of promoting
a better understanding of the principles
underlying the game.” What those prin-
ciples are should be set down.
“Susie Swattit”: Hell hath no fury like
a woman scorned, but it has been left to
our own day and to America to sheet
the lesson home. One Mrs. Katherine
Halstead, of Connecticut, has been suc-
cessful in obtaining a divorce from her
husband on the ground of cruelty. He
does not appear to have dragged her
about by the hair or thrown bottles at
her—his was a viler villainy. As she told
the Court, he habitually made fun of the
way she played golf. The decree nisi
was handed to her wet with the judicial
signature before she stepped down from
the witness-box.
Car and Cycle
“C.Q.”: The latest Melbourne centen-
ary proposal is an international light-car
race for a purse of £3OOO. The probable
course will be round Albert Park lake,
a shallow pond about half a mile in
diameter and within coo-ee of the centre
of the city. A little alteration would
turn the border of the lake into a respect-
able speedway and a 200-mile race could
be concluded in an afternoon. The only
other alternative is Phillip Island, and
ocean liners would have to be put on to
transport the multitude.
* ■* * *
“Deemster”: The Isle of Man has just
seen a type of motor-car race unusual
in Britain—a go-as-you-please through
the streets of a town, in this case.
Douglas. Brian Lewis, who was recently
third in the Le Mans circuit race, won.
driving an Alfa-Romeo, and his mate on
that occasion, Richards, was second with
a Bugatti. The most notable race of this
kind takes place at Monte Carlo, where,
for a brief period, the exhaust odors
from cars twisting through narrow streets
and alleys obliterate even the scent of
garlic.
* * * *
“Kick Starter”: British motor-cycle
heads break out in a new place in
August with a motor-cycle rally. This is
intended to be, like motor-car events on
the same lines, as much a social as a
sporting gathering, and a huge entry is
already assured. The Australian m.-c.
authorities tried to organise something of
the sort last year with Melbourne as a
rallying point. The cost to riders from
Queensland and Westralia was one of the

hurdles, but there is a chance that the
plan may be revived for the Melbourne
centenary.

“Sprocket”: In Britain, as in Australia,
the hard times have driven the multitude
back to the old push-bike, and there are
more machines in evidence to-day than
in the bicycling craze of the dying nine-
teenth century. Even the old tandems,
triplets and quadruplets are in use again,
reappearing as suddenly as they vanished
30 years ago. In those days the middle
possie on a triplet was as cushy as a
politician’s job. A wise rider let the
fellows in front and behind do the push-
ing, while he just let his feet go round
with the pedals.
Racquet and Bawl
“Bournemouth”: At time of writing
the Australian Davis Cuppers are touring
the “smalls,” as the actors say, figuring
in various tournaments in the counties.
They are down to sail for America on
August 12, but may meantime play an
Austrian team at Vienna, where they also
showed on the last tour. The German
visit, proposed earlier in the piece, seems
to have been Hitlered to leg.
“Rev. Knucklebone”: The N.S.W.
tennis authorities put duty before all else
last week when they declared a State
hard-courts representative, a man who
came within a hair’s breadth of beating
Jack Crawford in a big tourney last year,
a professional. He had actually taken
a job as ,tennis demonstrator and
instructor in a Sydney store. There will
be a long interval for laughter.
* * * *
“Kooyong”: After a lot of backing
and filling the English tennis authorities
have accepted the Australian invitation
to send over a team for next season.
Hitherto, there has been much talk of
the necessity for resting the first-class
players, and it is possible the Englishmen
will offer a team of second-raters. If
that be so, the show will fall through,
Australia having already asked for the
best procurable—nothing else would be a
paying proposition.
* * * *
“Top Spin”: It is likely that an Aus-
tralian tennis team will visit the Shivery
Isles shortly. N.S.W. proposed to send
only its own players, but M.L. asked for
representatives from other States. Hop-
man should be able to go from Victoria,
and that most promising South Austra-
lian youngster, Schwartz, should not be
overlooked. M.L. will have Stedman
back from Wimbledon.
* * * *
“Rev. Knucklebone”: Australia’s suc-
cess at Wimbledon has led more than
one tennis scribe on this side the Line to
refer to the English championship as
“practically” that of the world. There
is no “practically” about it —it is a
world’s title. In 1913 the International
Tennis Federation ruled that the Wimble-
don event should be officially classed as
the grass-court championship of the
world: so there we are.
Miscellaneous
“The Gaffer”: Lovelock, the Maori-
land Rhodes scholar and Olympic repre-
sentative, set the seal on a great running
career in a match between Oxford-Cam-
bridge and Cornell-Princeton universities
in America, by running the mile in 4min.
7 3-ssec. This is 1 3-ssec. better than
Ladoumergue’s world record, made in
1931. Bonthron, of Princeton, ran sec-
ond in 4min. 8 7-10 sec. The Americans
won the tourney with eight firsts to six.
* * * *
“Shell”: The rumors of Bob Pearce’s
intention to turn professional have proved
correct. He is signed up to meet English-
man Ted Phelps in a match at Toronto
for 2500 dollars, win or lose. The
Canadian amateurs refused to accept
Bobby’s entry for their big carnival on
July 1, but one of them was compelled
to apologise for alleging he was going
into the money game. A week after the
apology, the contract was signed.
* * * *
“Long Dog”: Two of Australia’s
Waterloo Cups for 1933 have been run
off, though, as the dates clashed, many
of the best dogs were absent from both
meetings. At Geelong the final pro-
vided an unusual ending in a tie between
two N.S.W. dogs, My Andy and Maurice,
The winners are owned by Maher and
Nicholls, of Smithfield, and are both by
Andy. The N.S.W. event, at Rooty Hill,
was won by L. Greentree’s Glenford, a
black-and-white bitch by Glen Quhair-
Ballina.
* :!: % *
“Tenth Slip”: There is a move afoot
in Sydney cricket circles to introduce
one-day matches into the grade compe-
titions. The change would be a god-
send, for district club cricket is nowa-
days getting as stodgy as a Test, and
even cricket enthusiasts have to be
dragged to see the games. One-day
matches with batsmen trying to get
runs and bowlers really seeking wickets
would do the game a lot of good.
League cricket in England has shown
what a success short and necessarily
bright matches can be.


A GALLERY OF GOLFERS.
No. 1.
At Kensington with Pen and Pencil.
The Australian Golf Club, now located
in lordly pride at Kensington, had its
beginnings in Moore Park, the first tee
being nearly opposite the main entrance
of Sydney Cricket Ground as we know
it tn> rtov + jr. j
it to-day, and the play-off towards Rand-
wick. Some members ot the Union Club
gathered together to spread the gospel
of the game by precept and example. As
far as contemporary records show, this
body was responsible for the introduc-
tion of organised golf to N. S. Wales.

lhat was in 1882. Some six years later
toe area was thrown . open to . ,he P ubli<: -
I he club temporarily went into retire-
ment; most of the members played on
a course at Concord provided by Miss
Eadith Walker. In those days Concord
was somewhat inaccessible, and after a
time the club was revived under the hon-
orary secretaryship of J. W. Fletcher
It acquired Queen’s Park, Waverley, a
and rS e e ave h ffie W e aS °kn
.^ e . me f great hlhp. So
much so that the club transferred its
increasing membership to links at Bot-
any, which later became the Ascot race-
course. When the lease expired, a com-
pany was formed to take over the pre-
sent area at Kensington. Since this
hegira the club has flourished exceed-
ingly; its only setback since the ’eighties
was experienced last year, when the club-
house, built in 1905 and frequently added
to, was burned to the ground. A splen-
did new building has been erected in its
place, and the course and its appoint-
ments to-day rank among the best south
of the Line.

Ea y bership details are unavail-
able ; most of the club s records were
destroyed in the fire. There are now 400
t,4.b members, 50 provisional members,
2°o associates, 30 juniors, 50 country
and 80 non-playmg members. There are
an 18-hole course covering 6401 yards
and a nine-holer extending over 2306
yards. To the deep satisfaction of those
with the critical temperament, play over
tbe 18 " hole course can be watched from
the balconies without moving from the
clubhouse. Here also black-and-white
men and photographers can do their
nefarious work in comfort,
No particular hole stands out as especi-
ally difficult or easy. Much depends in
this respect on individual play. All the
short holes have been done in one, and

celebrated conformably to tradition,

ties, but he did his level best. First
to catch his eye was Colonel A.
B. Stevens, C.M.G., D. 5.0., V.D., who
led the 2nd Battalion of the A.I.F.
Chief Inspector of Telephones for the
State railways, he is a member of
the greens committee, and is as methodi-
ight John Vicars, famous in Van-
nals of Australian wool manufacture. He
has been captain and committeeman and
president; he retired from the presidency
last year because of ill-health. No. 3 is
A. E. Box, who is agent in Australia for
White Horse whisky, and has large pas-
toral interests in addition. He is a very
good player and a very good fellow, and
y° u won’t find a better-dressed golfer on
an y hnks.
No. 4 is Charles L. Parsons, head
one York-street’s biggest woollen
warehouses. He also is a capital golfer,
b f ing Particularly hard to beat in match
No ' / I s Dr. R. K. Lee Brown,
ELe is one of the most brilliant golfers in
N. S. Wales, and if he improved his put-
ting would figure with credit in any corn-
pany. But a busy Macquarie-street
specialist can’t give all his time to golf,
much as he might like to. Dr. Lee Brown
has helped to bring the Kirk-Windeyer
Cup to N. S. Wales, and he won the club
championship when 15. There is a story
that his pride in this achievement was
chilled a bit by hearing one old bird say
to another, “It’s all very well to see boys
beat men, but, mark my words, sir, it’s
no good to the game.” The doctor is
skipper of the club’s A-grade team.
N. S. Collie, whom we see doing the
sword dance with a pair of irons, does
not habitually appear on the links in
the garb of Old Gaul. He has been 40
years in Australia, and he served in the
A.I.F. ; but he is none the less a Scot, as
his native Doric testifies. The cheerful
Collie is a Dunlop-Perdriau man. So is
No. 7, L. F. Anivitti, who is Dunlop-
■ Perdnau’s N.S.W. director and manager,
He is some distance removed from that
schoolboy figure, but that does not worry
the amiable L.F.A.; nothing does. No
member gets more enjoyment from his
game. No. 8, G. K. Bain, who is also some-
thing of a weight-lifter when on the scales,
is a very popular Kensingtonian. Sydney
manager of Australian Guarantee Corp.,
he has a ready wit and an effective flow
of repartee, which is hardly surprising-
he was a Digger. No. 9 is A. L. Blythe,
captain of the club, and hon. treasurer
for a number of years. He is of inde-
pendent means, and has a notable name
for good works; for years he was hon.
secretary of the Hospital Saturday Fund.
E. A. Finlay, whose striking marcel-
wave effect is evident in the drawing, is
tenth on the list. A keen club member,
he is manager of the Union Assurance
Co. m Sydney. He is followed by banker
J. R. D. Scott, of the Commercial of
Sydney. A fine player, Scott was on the
scratch mark for many years. No. 12
is J. Carruthers, an engineer, and an-
a fte e r r nn°l th . e < 5 b ’ i V J*
atternoon on the links with Carruthers
and Bain is a feast of fun and a liberal
education in good fellowship.
tj M c. , , •
r? S e D T- S
, , on F rl th s list, is vice-captam
and has served on the committee for five
years. He also fought in the A.1.F., and
came back with the Military Cross. Off
the links he is chairman of directors of
James Sandy and Co. A. W. H. Padfield,
No. 14, is the club’s president. If he
were not as modest as he is genial he
might claim a large contribution to its
prosperity; he has served on the com-
mittee since 1911. He is another insur-
ance man. Justin Laycock, who comes
next, is a retired pastoralist. His colors
were borne on the turf by Kennaquhair,
winner of the Sydney Cup and other big
races.
The younger Harry Hattersley, No. 16,
is a chartered accountant. As a golfer he
has an Australian reputation, having won
the national amateur championship in
1930 and the State title this year. He
is probably the longest hitter playing golf
in Australia. R. P. Walker, No. 17, is
chief clerk in the N.S.W. Treasury. He
is another of the Digger clan, and
was never once “crimed” on service
for wearing his hair too long. A. H.
Hattersley, senior, who has drawn No.
18 marble, has been for some years a
club committeeman. A good golfer and
a perfect host, he is a flourmiller in busi-
ness life and a hard-wheat expert, but
anyone who can get to his ear with a
hard-luck story finds he has the softesf
of hearts.
Frith has scarcely done justice to the
classic features of Captain J. Walker, No.
19. An Irishman, he is an old Regular
gunner officer with a long record of ser-
vice behind him. He is the club’s secre-
tary. W. H. Childs, No. 20, is, of all
the members, the best known to the
police. The Commissioner does not
appear on the links in such semi-official
guise as the artist makes out, however.
S. H. Brady, a bank official in Sydney,
is next on the list. He also is a Digger,
and, as his picture shows, well imbued
with the undefeatable spirit of that fam-
ous band. Last comes Dr. Rutherford
Darling, a leading Macquarie-street sur-
geon. Of his golf it may be said that
the doctor gets a lot of fun out of it;
leave it at that.


WOMAN, SERIOUSLY CONSIDERED.
BY PRIMOBLASTUS.
EACH of us is a chain of discordant
atavisms, and every man’s strength
is the strength of his weakest link.
In nine cases out of ten, you'll find a
woman working on that link with a file.
Woman is always clamoring to be under-
stood, and she never will permit herself
to be brought into perspective. Here you
have a striking proof of Nature's in-
fallible discretion, because if woman
could once be understood men would
emigrate in a body and live permanently
at sea.
1 have been no niggard of my counsel
to the sex. I have reasoned with Maria
and sternly rebuked Joan; I have done
my manifest duty to Chloe, Matilda,
Henriette, Myrtilla, Mop, Trixie, Maude
and Jemima and others, including Sarah
Jane. For the regeneration of these and
a hundred more have 1 yearned and
yearned and yearned, for years and years
and years. But these, and all their like,
be but kittle cattle, hard to have or to
hold.
Temperamentally, Woman is either
a devastating tropic hurricane or an un-
known Antarctic continent, a wild scream
or a dead silence, a salamander or a fish.
She has no half-tones.
Sooner or later every healthy young
man hies him forth in search of a wife.
That’s the idea in books. In reality, the
simple youth is marked down and
stalked, and when the lady gets right
up behind him, and has her lariat about
his loins in one fell irreparable swoop,
he grins the sickly grin that of eld broad-
ened the face of Balaam’s ass before that
orator grew wise, and he makes an idio-
tic statement to the effect th’at he has
wooed the Destined Maid.
But there’s no help for him. Do what
he will, he Can’t Keep Away. He braces
himself with a Turkish bath, he fortifies
his timid soul with wine, and he goes
forth smoothly to be squeezed out and
mopped up.
When the young man is betrothed he’s
put on the spit, and when he is once
wedded —well, Madam is served. Happy
he, if he’s permitted to have a picking
of his own small bones.
When a young woman is betrothed,
she’s put on velvet. To start with, she
has the alluring consciousness that she’s
played her cards to win against over-
whelming odds. In these days, no young
man really wants to marry. But the
voice of Nature gulls him, and the voice
of Paul of Tarsus sounds clarion-clear
in compromise across the wrecks of tirhe,
and a voice that smells hot whispers the
shameless whisper that she’s an awf’lly
nice girl and not a bit like other girls.
So the victim is led to the altar, and
he never sees the dour faces of Disillu-
sion and Disenchantment glowering
hungrily at him over the dainty shoulders
of the bridesmaids —who also are
“awf’lly nice girls and not a bit like other
girls”; but it’s tapu for him thenceforth
and for ever.
He works harder than he ever worked
before, and he drops his club and his
good cigars and his best friends, and he
enwraps himself with chest-protectors
and a soulless counterfeit of gentle joy,
and he stews in his own gravy from
morn till dewy eve. He becomes, in
short, that tamest of all tame creatures
the Merely Married Man.
When his wardress icily refers to his
single days, he simulates a shudder. He
is sensible enough not to dare to think
of the days that were, the days of com-
radeship and countless compensations
and golden calms and sounding sweet
alarums —the days when one could sing
and not be ashamed. Truly to appre-
ciate his miserable state, you must watch
him when he is alone, or in the company
of casual strangers.
Mark him in a tea-room, on a foot-
path, in a tram. See how meek and
spiritless he is, how pale and wan! Not
only do his trousers bag at the knees,
but his knees bag in the trousers. He
dares scarcely look at a friendly woman
lest he be accused of flirting. You might
as soberly conceive a hippopotamus trip-
ping it through a minuet.
The Merely Married Man has ceased
to be a person, and is fast ceasing to
be an individual; he’s just a remainder.
Things might be amended speedily if
men would but Arise. Woman could
be brought to reason like any other
wild animal. Let the men league
themselves into fervid bands and swear
solemnly by the high brows of their gods
that for a certain period there shall be
no marriage. Let all the women have this
freedom they demand. Let them go out
and take part in that everlasting hurly-
burly in which men bite and tear each
other to get their women frills.
And let the men already married do
their part. Let them swear —yea, even
by their stooping shoulders! —let them
swear that their daughters shall justify
their existence during the period of
pause by working and suffering neck
and neck with their brothers. Let the
woman be forced into competition on
equal terms, her ancient handicap being
for ten years removed. Let her at length
be driven to see how great and goodly
and precious a thing is this comradeship
of man for man, this thing at which
through all the ages of her empire she
has mocked; and so let her be won by
stress of redeeming circumstance to see
that man is not of his true v nature a
bigger type of woman, and that woman
will for ever sow folly and reap the
whirlwind in so far as she makes it her
aim and ambition to be a little man.
At the end of that period there
would be some joyous marriages.
Woman would have learned that it is a
greater and a nobler thing to be proud
of her destiny than of her legs.
For the comforting of fellows with
wives, I note that the reference in this
sermon is only to men who are merely
married. I should hate to be misunder-
stood.
The Palette.
In his show at Horderns’ Gallery, Syd-
ney, Ernest Buckmaster sets out to prove
that though he has won fame as a
painter of portraits he is equally at home
“Was it you I kissed at the Polo Ball?"
“About what time?”
in landscape, marine pieces, flowers and
other still life, and almost anything you
care to mention. There is a wonderful
clarity of purpose and sureness of touch
in almost every one of these canvasses.
The landscapes have the crispness of
Streeton’s, but they are more dramatic.
The flower pieces, particularly the zin-
nias, could be put among a group of
Hans Heysen’s, and pass unchallenged.
There are a couple of river scenes that
strike a new distinctive note, and in such
vivid contrasts of tone as the glimpse of
rocks, beach and distant sunlit sea,
“Cliffs, Kilcunda, Victoria,” the realism
reaches transcendent heights. Buck-
master’s pictures need no explana-
tion. This, of course, bars them from the
realm of high modern art, but in that
realm most plain people still wander
hopelessly, despite all the attempts of
the practitioners to explain what they
mean w'hen they paint something that
looks like a cow in a fit and label it
“Sabbath Calm.”
The 28 canvasses shown by Percy
Lindsay at the Macquarie Galleries, Syd-
ney, are land- and sea-scapes, rather low
in key. and painted meditatively. To a
greater extent, perhaps, than any other
Sydney artist. Lindsay gets the spirit and
atmosphere of the Sydney waterside
a strange compound of jauntiness and
melancholy. Lane Cove and Berry s Bay
are among this artist's happy hunting
grounds, and he has also felt the chacm
of Balmoral. A golf-links scene, against
the light, is perhaps the most ambitious
of the painter’s flights, and in it the play
of shadows is very prettily treated.
Kenneth Macqueen’s show of water-
colors at the Grosvenor Galleries, Syd-
ney, is interesting as showing the rapid
development of a young painter who in-
sists on putting his own interpretation
on things seen. Macqueen’s style is clear
and forceful, and he mixes a little poetry
with.his paints. He has a fine feeling
for rhythm in landscape, and is cultivat-
ing a fetching taste in color. Many
of his pictures, particularly the sea-
pieces, seem to be frankly experimental,
but they are happy experiments. “The
Headland” and “Seaside Town” are
capital essays in color and composition.
A year or so ago George Bell and
Arnold Shore started an academy in
Melbourne for teaching the principles of
modern art, whatever they are, and ( the
first instalment of pupils’ work is now
being shown at the Athenaeum. It is
difficult to discover what criterion of
excellence was applied in the selection of
the exhibits. .Some of the pictures are
indistinguishable from the art of the old
lady who decorates the pavement with
chalks on the Town Hall stand adjacent.
Others show various degrees of academic
influence, especially the work of Mr.
Bell himself, whose self-portrait is re-
spectability personified. Others are easily
recognised as more or less faithful imita-
tions of the Old Masters of the Modern
Movement. Louise Thomas appears to be
trying to define a real sensation in “Girl
in Black,” but mixes color and tone with
the line convention. M. M. Clegg shows
the beginnings of knowledge, but Roger
James is a real “modern” —that is to say,
he paints like the ingenuous Italians ol
400 years ago. L. Fairley seems to be try-
ing to create some order out of the con-
fusion of her impressions, and some of
the still-lifes have qualities of color which
would make them agreeable decorations
if they were turned upside down so as
further to destroy the illusion of reality.
No Australian painter has adapted
himself to prevailing fashions in art so
perfectly as Rupert Bunny, an epitome of
whose life work is on show at Melbourne
Athenamm. At one time Bunny painted
very well in the Royal Academy manner,
and a gigantic canvas of a naked man in
a cavern or cell attests his competence.
Then he was attracted by the French
Salon picture; as evidence of this phase an
even larger frame encloses some willowy
damsels drying themselves after a dip.
Then he seems to have been inspired suc-
cessively by the impressionists, the photo-
graphic realists and the moderate mod-
ernists. The most recent phase of this
veteran Proteus appears to be a more
personal statement of what he sees. Nine-
teen pictures all carry the same label —
“Scene in Botanical Garden, Melbourne,”
but habits are hard to forget and the
purity of the impression is marred by
traces of all the fashions the painter pur-
sued in earlier years.
Adrian Lawlor is a literary man turned
painter and his exhibition of 60
“modern” pictures at the Fine Arts, Mel-
bourne, smells more of the study lamp
than of the wattle or the eucalyptus.
Hence it is as much use to the Australian
artist as a fur coat to a New Guinea
wench. Nature yields none of her secrets
to the painter who approaches her in a
mood of contemptuous impudence, and
there is less light and air in Lawlor’s
landscapes than is commonly to be found
at the bottom of a river. Moreover,
although representation is anathema to
the modernist painter, Lawlor’s art is
representational. Some of the pictures
are dedicated to Pablo Picasso, Igor
Stravinsky and other eminent modern
figures in painting and music.
S.A. Society of Arts’ latest show is
unusual. Gwynith Norton paints china
better than ever, but adds also a col-
lection of pictures which are pleasing but
not distinguished. The novelty comes in
with Mrs. Agnes Rymill. She has
been experimenting in china-making, and
now shows—for the love of the art and
not for sale —a fine assortment of orna-
ments, mostly representing fragile flowers
in their natural tints.
Vic. Nat Gallery’s latest acquisi-
tions, per medium of Alfred Fenton’s
bounty, are Gainsborough’s “Duchess of
Grafton” (£7000), a river landscape by
Ruysdael (£2350), “Miss Muriel Wilson,”
by Orpen (£375), and “A Dutch Home-
stead,” by Wouverman (£600). The
Gainsborough justifies its presence more
by its historical consequence than its
artistic importance, the head not being a
real head but the fashionable conven-
tion about heads prevailing when it was
painted; but the lace is better realised
than the shawl of the Orpen lady, which
is only a slick example of Slade school
technical teaching. The landscapes are
good examples of seventeenth-century,
Dutch painting.
Maid-Melody: A Dream.
Somehow I know her little hour is spent,
For when I called, as I had called of old,
She waited in the shadows, pale and cold,
Across the petalled lawns.... I had not meant
That she should know a heart of hers could
hold
This discontent.
And “Melody,” I cried, “O, Melody!”
She ran, like music then, across the grass;
But, as a far refrain would sweep, and pass,
Fainting to nothingness reluctantly;
Some strange world called her, beckoned
her. Alas!
That it should be!
For she is gone, is gone. The garden lies
Flushed in its sunny slumber, and no call
Adown the flowery aisles, no cry at all,
Will bring her, lithe and lovely, to my eyes;
Laughing and leaning where the shadows fall,
To tantalise.
Oh dreams!
If dreams could only live, could lull one's
pain
With comradeship, and love as warm as wine!
Dream-Melody, it was no fault of mine.
I saw two lovers laughing in the rain
Oh, would I had not seen their arms entwine,
That I might be content might dream
again.

Film on teeth is dangerous!
Just look at film under the microscope
Queer germs live on your teeth. Science links them to
tooth decay, gum disorders, and many other troubles.
Germs are glued to teeth by an ever-forming film.

This is what the scientist finds
when he analyses film on teeth
•a A species of Lactobacilli now
* held responsible for tooth de-
cay by many scientists.
ty A species of Streptococcus
Pyogenes that may get into
the blood through the tissues
and cause serious infection.
You don’t need a micro-
scope to pick out film-
stained teeth. The naked
eye can’t miss them, for
film is ugly and dis-
gusting.
But where the naked
eye sees ugliness, the
microscope sees danger. Magnify film i ,000 times and
you will see living germs of many kinds. Look
especially at those roc-shaped ones in pairs and
groups —Lactobacilli is their scientific Latin name.
Destroyers of Lovely Teeth
Lactobacilli are the “germs of tooth decay.” They feed on
the particles of food that cling to the teeth. They give
off lactic acid that dissolves the tooth enamel, then devours
the part beneath. Finally the nerve is reached, causing
abscesses and often serious infection.
Lactobacilli appear in countless numbers. In fact, the film
scraped from a single tooth may easily contain millions of
living organisms. The only way science accepts of removing
germs from teeth is to remove the protective film-coat in
which they live and multiply. Film clings stubbornly. It
defies all ordinary ways of brushing. That’s why Pepsodent
laboratories have always centred their attention on the film-
removing properties of their tooth paste. Now these scien-
tific laboratories have developed a new and revolutionary
material for removing ugly, stubborn film. It is radically
different from any found in other tooth pastes —different in
composition and in action.
Some tooth pastes remove film with materials so hard that
they scratch the enamel. But the new material in Pepsodent
is soft—twice as soft as the material commonly used in
dentifrices. What’s more, it shows extraordinary power in
removing film and giving brilliant polish.
This new cleansing and polishing material is contained in
Pepsodent exclusively.

“L. Ree”: South Aus. has a snaffle for
Shylock. It passed a Money Lenders
Act in 1903, and in a 1924 measure the
principle was extended to hire-purchase
and t.-p. agreements to admit of the
Court reopening any such contract to
pay interest. The thing is found to work
quite well.

“Frig”: N.Q. foresters find no diffi-
culty in selling “burrs” or “burls” (B.
12/7/’33). America and England buy
all the burr walnut we care to send.
As for that 63001 b. oregon-pine burl, I
wouldn’t have it in my back yard except
for fire kindlers —it would be full of
resin.
H« * * *
“Tully Canegrower”: It is frequently
asserted in the South that Queensland
sugar-farms have been sold at £2OO p.a.
The average would be nearer £3O
to £4O, though 1 know of a ridiculous
sale at £l5O. I have also heard of the
sale of a fruit-farm in a southern State
for £4OO p.a. On that should 1 be justi-
fied in claiming that the selling price of
fruit should be reduced?
* * * *
“Go Do”: I agree with “Aitchee” (B.
21/6/’33) about the canning of bunny,
not so much for the home market as for
export. Roaming about U.S.A. upder all
sorts of conditions convinced me that
a neatly-canned line would sell ; the
Yanks are game- and chicken-crazy.
The supplier of tasty bunny joints would
get the same response from them as did
the “tamatto-juice” grower, the grape-
fruit packer, and others who provided
something new for a nation of food
idolators.

“O. W. Waireki”: Since Maoriland
lost its honey export market, local retail
prices have been greatly reduced. My
grocer sold me a billy containing 51b. of
excellent honey for 2s. 3d.; the same
quantity of jam costs at least 3s. 4d. A
bit of M.L. honey comes to Australia,
but the tariff makes it much dearer than
Australian.
t Hi
“J.D.”: Though Tas. apple-shippers
estimated 2\ million cases as about the
limit of this season’s export, the tally
went to over three million —within
300,000 of last season’s. Prices, though
satisfactory for the early London cargoes,
have been patchy. General quality was
excellent on shipment, but several cargoes
on reaching London showed a somewhat
heavy percentage of bitter pit.
* * jN *
“Jackaburra”: In Brisbane prime
mutton can be bought for 3d. per pound.
Fish costs three or four times as much.
That's why Australians eat so little fish.
Consumption would increase if there
were factories where the catch would be
prepared for distribution, at a price that
people could afford to pay, by the quick-
freezing and cellophane-wrapping pro-
cesses.

“C. 8.”: There’s a lot in what you say
in “Sunlight Butter” (B. 12/7/’33). I
had lunch at a home in Devon. Recog-
nising the taste of the butter, I said to
our hostess “My word, this is good; is
it Australian?” She replied that it was,
and that “a doctor friend says it’s the
best; because of the sunnier climate the
grass is always riper and the butter con-
tains more vitamins.” It will pay us to
switch over to the “Sunlight” stuff. The
word has a higher advertising value in
cloudy, rainy old England than “Kan-
garoo.”
“El V.”: I was a member of a market-
ing delegation which visited British ports.
Every port authority was eager to get
our produce ; but one and all insisted
that we should produce it to their stand-
ards. And we don’t. Take butter. Britons
are accustomed to a pale, unsalted article.
Our producers and manufacturers can
never get it out of their heads that a
rich golden hue and the tang of salt are
essential. The Briton’? taste has become
accustomed to certain blending flavors.
Denmark provides them.
* * * *
“R.O’H.”: “Collingwood” (B. 5/7/’33)
has a very slight knowledge of what
constitutes good sugar land. In Innisfail
(N.Q.), where the heaviest cane crops in
Australia are produced, surface soil is
only about lOin. deep. In Papua an
area of nearly 19,000 acres at Wanigela,
Collingwood Bay, has been reported on
by a sugar-cane expert as equal, if not
superior, to the Innisfail sugar lands, and
there the rich surface soil has a depth
of 2ft. to 3ft. 3in., with an alluvial sub-
soil. On the 20-acre paddock referred
to planting was carried out by natives,
supervised by a white man,, none of
whom had any experience; yet the plot
yielded 76 tons to the acre.

NORTH OF
TWENTY-EIGHT
What Is a White Man?
“Kone”: I get a lot of fun out of this
White Australia business. The premises
of those who want to hand North Aus-
tralia over to the Asiatic are that it is
in the tropics, and that no European can
adapt himself to a tropical climate be-
cause his natural element is the cooler
zones. Then they select, as the Asiatic
who is most likely to adapt himself (and
who does adapt himself very admirably,
too), a person who comes from Nippon,
which hangs on the 40th North Parallel
in the latitude which corresponds to that
of Maoriland. I have been colder in
Japan than anywhere, not excepting
Norway and the heights of the Taurus
Range.
Why Asiatic people who have to wrap
up themselves like Polar .bears in winter
should succeed in North Australia while
it is taken for granted that Southern Aus-
tralians, bred in perpetual sunshine, “can-
not stand the beastly climate” is a mys-
tery, more especially as history has
shown that the most strongly persisting
races are those of Nordic origin whose
ancestors were reared among the snows.
If you don’t believe me, take a trip to
the Punjab and have a look at some of
the descendants of Alexander’s Greeks.
Fair-skinned, blue-eyed, tall and lean,
they form the steeliest-nerved “aerialised
battalions” in the Frontier force, and
acknowledge their origin by wearing a
medallion portrait of the conqueror who
led their forefathers to the Hydaspes 2400
years or thereabouts ago. Alexander’s
army came from a race bred in a north-
ern latitude approximate to that of
Sydney and hailing originally from
further north still.
We shall never settle the North until
(1) we get rid of our inferiority complex,
(2) we are prepared to wait for results
in our transplantation schemes.
No politician will even worry about
anything which calls for 20 years’ con-
structive work. He wants to see imme-
diate profits, immediate taxation fields
and something that will grow votes for
him within 18 months at the most.
We carefully choose cadets to go to
the Mandated Territory; test them medi-
cally to make sure that they are physi-
cally adapted for the job and let experi-
enced tropical administrators weigh their
mental fitness, and, once we have
accepted them, we train them and assure
their futures for life.
But with settlers in the North of Aus-
tralia the policy is to dump ’em down
in any unwanted bit of desert without
test, experience or instruction. Let them
scratch and be damned to them!
“Wyara”: An eight-year-old girl fell
seriously ill in the Kynuna district, be-
tween Cloncurry and Winton. The “fly-
ing doctor” (Dr. A. R. Vickers) diag-
nosed the case as acute urgent appendi-
citis, and flew with the child to Clon-
curry Hospital, where a successful opera-
tion was performed. Before the parents
arrived by car seven hours later the
child was out of danger. The ’plane did
the trip in 80 minutes. Creed, color or
class are unknown terms to the “flying
doctor”; the need for help is a warrant
for assistance and no charge is made.
Dr. Vickers has made several dashes
of upwards of 1000 miles each during
his thousands of miles of flying into the
Northern Territory and Cape York.
* * * *
“Diggaire”: The weight of years is
pressing more heavily upon Diggers
suffering from war disabilities. Admis-
sions of such to Queensland hospi-
tals in 12 months totalled 2713, dis-
charges 2629, and 1106 are still receiving
treatment. At Rosemount there are
55 in-patients and 725 out-patients alone,
an increase of about 200. I reckon all
Diggers should receive the old-age pen-
sion at 55 years.
* * * *
“Fossicker”: A revival of prospecting
in the North, “Hall’s Creek” (B.
12/7/’33), might be the means of bring-
ing to light a saddle pack containing 750
fine ounces of gold, which was lost in
the Territory 54 years ago. Four miners
—Harry Houschildt, Johannes Nol-
tenius, Henry Roberts and Fred Starke —
won 7500 z. of fine gold worth £3OOO for
their first week in possession of the old
Extended Union mine, south of Brock’s
Creek. After carefully weighing the
metal they stowed it in a saddle pack on
a trusty steed and prepared for a trip
to Darwin. Before leaving, however,
they decided to celebrate, and while the
festivities proceeded the horse with the
gold snapped its bridle and galloped away.
Neither horse nor gold was ever seen
again. The men worked the Extended
until it petered out, and in 1883 were
massacred by abos. on the Daly River.
* * * *
“Bainings”: It won’t be the fault of
the anthropologists if the white popula-
tion of the Pacific doesn’t grow. Rio
Fortune, author of “Sorcerers of
Dobu,” and Gregory Bateson, research
worker of an English university, have
been hard at it on the Sepik. F. E. Wil-
liams, Rhodes scholar and an ex-officer
of the Dunsterforce, has been in Papua
on a Government job; Bernatzig, the
Viennese authority on negro ethnology,
is ranging from Vila to Choiseul. Dr.
lan Hogbin has been on Guadalcanal
Groves at Kaevieng and Tabar, Camilla
Wedgwood on Manam, near Madang,
and about a dozen others are in the Solo-
mon-New Guinea zone. Soon there won’t
be any room for Kanakas North of 28.
* *■ * *
“L. R. Russ”: “Tanumbirini’s” senti-
ments are to be admired (B. 5/7/’33),
but the question must be faced squarely.
Water alone will not settle our central

ard Springs and Strangway Springs, to
mention two places close to Lake Eyre,
both have a liberal supply of water from
natural springs and artesian bores, but
settlement is nil, if the pub is excepted at
the former place and an occasional tribe
of nomadic blacks at the latter. The water
is quite good for man and beast, but is of
little or no use for irrigation purposes
owing to the presence of mineral salts. The
soil, too, is so heavily impregnated with
soluble salts that it is very doubtful if
even good water would benefit anything
other than the hardy natural plants
already there; and to depend on the
rainfall would be out of the question.
When searching for suitable water con-
servation areas for railway use between
Oodnadatta and Alice Springs, I had a
test hole put down near Blood’s Creek,
which is not far from the northern border
of South Australia, and in much better
country than that already mentioned, and
after a foot or two of the top soil had
been scraped away almost a solid mass
of gypsum was encountered. It is easy
to imagine how much use water stored
in such ground would be.

“Du Barrier ” : Near Collinsville
(Bowen district, N.Q.) wild pigs are
plentiful, and good money is earned by
pighunters. It is not a game for cripples
or cowards. The men always hunt in
pairs and on horseback. They beat the
thickets, their dogs chase the pigs into
the open, and the hunt proper begins.
Side-saddles are used. When alongside
the pig, the hunter jumps down on top
of him, grabs him by the ears, throws
and holds him. The second man now
arrives post haste, and the pig is tied,
left, and the hunt is continued. A dray
is in the offing, and when enough are
caught the pigs are loaded and brought
alive to the butcher. The kids get them
from horseback with .32’s and .44 s.
That’s easy and safe as falling out of
bed —well, comparatively, anyhow.

From Dan Thorn, one of the Eternals
of Croydon, Gulf of Carpentaria, (“where
no white man can hope to live per-
manently”) :
1 am of the third generation of Australian
natives. My grandmother (on the dam’s side)
and old Granny Gosper, the ancestress of all
the Gospers about Windsor and the Hawkes-
bury River, were sisters and orphans of an old
soldier. Old Mrs. Oakes and they were
reckoned the first three free children born in
Sydney; Granny Oakes was the oldest. Grand-
father Thorn and his wife, Susan Humm, were
. both natives; her brother went home to
England and distinguished himself in the wars,
then coming home.to die. His grave is in the
old Parramatta cemetery.
Grandfather Thorn received grants ol land
for bravery in capturing and shooting a noted
gang of bushrangers. Governor Brisbane
gave him a number of areas on and about
the Mulwarrie Creek, and extending to the
Gundary Plains. The bridge over the creek,
two miles from Goulburn, on the Cooma road,
was always called Thorn’s Bridge, and the
homestead was within sight of the road, and
named Brisbane Grove after the Governor.
“As We Said Before” is g00d.... Since it
started, two of my old rough pictures have
appeared, redrawn, of course, by Mahony.
When I get well and my hands ditto, then 1
will again send anything I see original.
I had an accident on my last trip, and I
went close to getting my foot cut off, and my
nerves have affected my eyesight and hearing,
so please forgive the writing, etc. I am in my
78th year and cannot recoup my forces as of
yore.”
Gals’ Gossip from Brisbane
One gets inundated with gilt-edged cards
these days as Show Week approaches.
Debs, and mothers of debs, are prepar-
ing gowns and arranging partners for
the great occasions. To crown our
felicity come the lads in blue. The elite
have decided that plain “Fleet Ball”
savors too much of the southern-capital
touch, so Brisbane’s effort has been
christened “Convoy Ball.”
All sorts of celebrities have signed on
the dotted line of acceptance for the
Show. The R.N.A.’s glad hand of wel-
come will be extended for the first time
to Ronald Cameron, newly-appointed
president.
Although Premier Stevens and Mrs.
Stevens were here but a few short hours,
they did the right thing, or things. They
viewed our city from the Town Hall
tower, they drove to Mt. Coot-tha,
peeped at the bougainvillaea gardens at
Toowong, and saw the reporters —not to
mention photographers. Sandwiched in
with this rush was lunch at Government
House.
Marriage, presentation at Court, a visit
to Sir Matthew Nathan’s home, America,
Paris—such are some of the very pleasant
experiences of Mrs. Blaikie Webster, who
returned on the Mooltan. She’s a Bris-
bane girl, daughter of the James Loves,
and lots of her friends are already
arranging to boil the billy in her honor.
He is Mt. Isa Webster.
Trippers this year have realised the
advantages of visiting the northern parts
of Queensland during the winter months,
and their realisation has brought smiles
to the faces of the shipping men. They
are all very cheerful as week after week
crowded vessels make the trip northward,
and to u rists return with tales of the wonders
of the northern playgrounds of the Barrier
The wedding of the F. W. Taylors’
son Arthur took place at St. Andrew’s
Church of England, Longreach. The
bride, Josephine Bell, second daughter of
the Colin Bells of Longreach, wore ivory
satin with her mother’s cream lace veil.
Lynette Bell and Rose Taylor ’maided in
blue and pink georgette, and carried
autumn bouquets.
Fun and frolic reigned at the Journal-
ists’ Ball at the Trocadero. The greatest
thrill (and there were plenty) was at mid-
night, when the “Terrible Tabloid” was
published. It was no ordinary dance
programme. There was a “beaut-he
mannequin and bathing parade, and
finally a bull-fight was staged. G.-G.
Isaac Isaacs, as usual, lent his patronage,
and Lieutenant-Governor Blair, always a
friend of the press, attended. He was
looked after by Mrs. W. Young, the
official hostess, whose black lace gown
showed sequin trimming.
Much-coveted kindergarten honors
were bestowed upon Mrs. Bruce Shearer
and Mrs. M. Baldwin when they were
made honorary life members of the
Creche and Kindergarten Association.
During a period of 26 years the only
others who have received such recogni-
tion are Mrs. Scott Fletcher and Mr. W.
L. Dowd.
Many bridge tables were arranged in
the Lord Mayor’s room when Mrs. Percy
Pease was chief organiser for the Naz-
areth Home for the Aged. Mayoress
Greene, in nut-brown flamisol, carrying
a bouquet of sweet-peas, figured in the
crowd.
France’s National Day
was celebrated by the Circle
Fran?aise when president
F. Genty sat at the head of
a flag-decked dinner table
at Lennon’s. Daughter
Yvonne, with white ermin-
ette jacket over her black
frock, helped to receive.
Our Consular Agent for
France, Major H. R. Carter,
and his wife were guests of
honor, Mrs. Carter in sap-
phire-blue velvet.
Ella O’Shea and brother
Pat threw a happy dinner
party at Toowong for Dr.
and Mrs. F. Harris, from
Sydney. Pretty Zoe Earl
brightened the table, and
Jock Birchall, medico
Harold Love, G. Schlapp
(from Melbourne) and
Harold Cooper (from Syd-
ney) were others there.
To furnish its kitchen,
the Lyceum Club ran a
sedate little bridge evening.
Members rolled up, and
were looked after by Mrs.
Firmin McKinnon, wife of
our “Courier” editor, and
herself a presswoman. Un-
aided by anyone, she served
supper in the twinkling of
an eye. Wild flowers beau-
tified the rooms.
Finance magnates, their tellers and
their typists, payers and receivers, made
merry at the Bankers’ Ball at the City
Hall. Sir Leslie Wilson attended. M. G.
Haymen was chief receiver and Mrs.
Hay men helped, wearing black lace
touched with sunset pink. Marjorie
Wilson wore a moulded frock of fox-
glove pink satin, Barbara Warry was in
white georgette with sparkling belt, and
black lace was Elsie Smith’s choice. The
Lord Mayor and Lady Mayoress were
with the officials ; she was in a lovely
orange-shaded frock with fur-trimmed
capelet. Mr. and Mrs. A. E. Moore
were there, Mrs. Moore’s frock showing
unusual violet ribbon trimming. The
Macartney lady used her very pretty
saxe-blue ostrich-feather fan to good
effect. Nell Haymen was in silver grey.
Secretary Jack Barlow will be welcomed
by the Creche and Kindergarten when
he hands them over the cheque.
The military took the floor at the
Carlton Cabaret when the Field Artil-
lery officers entertained. Gus Hughes
and his lady did the honors, she in ivory
satin. Mrs. Ralph, who came with the
Brigadier, wore black angel-skin lace.
Women could spend their lives these
days going “no trumps,” and some do.
But it is just as well, as bridge is the
easiest way to raise money. At a party
at Griffiths’ tearoom over 200 players
lent their support to the Incapacitated
and Wounded Sailors and Soldiers. The
Cameron lady was amongst the players,
and Mrs. W. I. Carr convened the whole
show, assisted by a few.
Two of our younger set have their
trunks packed for tours. Louy Gatacre
leaves on the Nieu Holland for Singa-
pore and Penang, and Mrs. Luya takes
Mary to the New Hebrides on the Oron-
say, sailing next year on the same ship
to England.

LIFE —A BUSINESS
It is a paradox, perhaps, that while Home Life is a refuge from
business, it is itself a business.
Money enters so largely into everything that it must be planned
for in every phase of life.
It is in business that money is earned, in the Home, chiefly, that it
is spent, and there is no sound reason why the spending should not be
regarded as being just as important as earning. In fact, it is far more
important, for earning is difficult, and must employ wisdom, forethought
and energy, while spending is easy, so easy that there is temptation to
spend unwisely.
Every Home, then, is a business, and needs an economic system, of
which the Savings Bank Pass Book can be the valuable basis.

A WOMAN'S
LETTER
The Canberra, which will be in Bris-
bane for that city’s carnival week, will
have Sir Philip and Lady Game as pas-
sengers when it ups anchor and sails for
the New Hebrides. Their Exes., though,
are being dropped off at Lord Howe
Island, where they will have a week of
the simple life before they are called for
by the regular island steamer.
A woman who visited Government
House last week told this Letter that she
nearly gnashed her teeth with rage when
she glimpsed no fewer than three pairs
of episcopal legs snugly ensconced in
gaiters while she was hard put to it to
keep circulation in her silk-clad ankles.
Never in the previous history of the Mac-
quarie-street fastness have three bishops
been under its roof for bed and board.
His Archgaiters of Melbourne and their
Graces of Armidale and Riverina signed
the visitors’ book. The New Oxford Cen-
tenary and the Australian Board of Mis-
sions’ pow-wow were responsible for the
presence of the shepherds in the vice-
regal pen.
St. Philip’s on Church Hill held fes-
tival last week just to tick off another of
its 77 years. That, of course, is the age
of the present building, for St. Philip’s is
as old as the arrival of the Endeavour,
and was the first parish in His Majesty’s
colony of New South Wales. There are
prints and drawings of the two churches
that preceded the present one; the first, on
the corner of Hunter and Bligh streets,
was of wattle and daub ; the second was
built of stone and had an outside tower
that signalled the faithful from a site
opposite to that now occupied by St.
Patrick’s. Up in the vestry, if you are
so minded, those in authority will take
from their safe the Communion service in
silver, sent by King George 111. to this
far-away bit of his kingdom. Very im-
pressive are the silver chalices and ewer
and the two patens; but alongside the
silver is a worn pewter mug with an
arrow on its handle. That, those in
charge will tell you rather sadly,
was for the convicts’ use when they
approached God’s table.
Two other treasures kept with care are
the Bible and prayer-book from which
the Reverend Richard Johnson read the
first service under the spreading Moreton
Bays. These have been autographed by
the Prince of Wales and the Duke of
York. One old church document that is
not made quite so public is a list of
fashionable pew-renters of other days,
who, as has been the way since time
immemorial, were in arrears.
Sydney’s R.S.P.C.A. had its 60th birth-
day this year ; to celebrate, it named the
annual money-raiser a diamond jubilee
ball, decked the walls and the foyer of
David Jones’s ballroom with life-size
posters of dog and cat and pig, and
started in to make merry after the second
dog-watch. This is always one of the
swagger balls of the year, and the
1933 model was, if anything, a bit more
satin-finished than its predecessors. Sir
Philip and Lady Game, both dog-lovers,
smiled on the party, and Aide Gifford
beamed rosily. The vice-regals were met
on arrival by R.S.P.C.A. president
Acocks and Mrs. Acocks, and by the
Commander Farncomb couple. The vice-
reine’s hedgerose-pink satins were in har-
mony with the first lady’s black chiffons,
and the second lady’s white satin frock
with its floral design ; the frocking of
organising-secretary Miss Compton Legge
struck a subdued note, and wedded black
bugles and black velvet.
During the evening pictures by Frank
Payne, May Gibbs and Sid Long were
auctioned for the funds, Jim Bancks
knocking them down in great style. There
was a voting competition for the most
popular breed of dog, the palm going
to the Scotch terrier, with the foxy a close
runner-up; the Alsatian got only fourth
place, although there was a poster of
him looking as though butter wouldn’t
melt in his mouth. Altogether admirable
were Mrs. Bradley’s gipsy-red chiffons
sown with gold sequins, Valerie Bavin’s
grey chiffons and rose-red shoes, Betty
Higgins’s black velvet frock, Mary Dob-
erer’s ivory satins and Mrs. Horace Shel-
ler’s poppy-gold crepe.
If you want to know what the Pyr-
mont soup kitchen means in the life of
the city, visit it on a day when the mer-
cury is congealing around about 42 de-
grees. The soup kitchen and the Sydney
City Mission, of which it is an important
by-product, are run by those two untir-
ing workers for good Padre S. Mac-
Donald and his wife. By way of a
contrast to the stockpots, the two hob-
nobbed with the fleshpots up in Govern-
ment House the other afternoon. It was
a small party, Lady Game bidding only
a few of her intimates to meet the two
who literally give all they have to feed
the poor. It’s to be hoped that some of
the guests may be inspired to write an
extra cheque for chops and address the
parcel Pyrmont.
This is the pleasing record Jack Cato’s
camera made of Anne Gordon when
she was last in Melbourne. Anne, who
is the daughter of former Justice Alex-
ander Gordon and his lady, is one of
Sydney’s clever young amateur, actresses,
and has already figured in many charity
productions. On August 15 and 16 she
will appear as Gracie, the tender-hearted
little Cockney shopgirl in “Nine Till Six,”
the play which takes place in a West End
dress shop and has not as much as
one male among its 16 characters. It
is being presented by the Doone
Dramatic Society under the direction of
Beryl Bryant, and the audience promises
to be a very swagger one, as the Bush
Book Club will benefit. Sir Philip and
Lady Game, however, will not be, as they
had intended, ornamenting the middle of
the front row. They will be off to
Brisbane for the Show festivities. Queens-
land’s vice-regal Wilsons will be their
hosts.
J. C. Williamson’s Charlie Westmacott
has been booked by the A.B.C. to give
a series of talks on the theatre “from
Genesis to the present day,” which, as
Claude Kingston remarked, might easily
be known as the Book of Revelations
when you consider some of the undress-
ing comedies we’ve had in our midst the
last year or two. The two, with genial
concert-manager Jack Griffiths, were in
the artists’ room with Peter Dawson after
that robust baritone’s concert last Thurs-
day. An earnest slip of an Irish girl
was saying to Peter in her soft brogue
“You really must call it DunnygzA,
Mr. Dawson.” “But,” protested another
daughter of Erin, “I’m Irish, and
I don’t call it Dunnygal.” “No?” said
Peter, “but it’s evidently high Irish.”
Major Condor, now the head serang
of National Broadcasts, was once gov-
ernor of Pentridge Gaol. The Girl in the
Flat Opposite suggests that if he ever
attends a music tea he should go as “The
Arrow and the Song.”
This is a recent photo, of Eugenie
Boland, one of the city’s well-known
singers, and one-time mayoress of Too-
woomba —that was during her brother’s
term of office on their native heath. Like
most singers, Eugenie speaks French
Italian and German, but there is perhaps
no other who speaks Gaelic so fluently.
She learned the ancient tongue when she
was en'gaged to sing at the Gaelic League
Festival in the Queen’s Hall, London.
Artist Septimus Power is arriving in
Sydney during the next few days with
his wife and enough pictures to stock the
Macleod Galleries with a one-man show.
Septimus is a Maorilander by birth, but
an Australian by length of residence. He
was officially attached as artist to the
A.I.F. in France, and one of the results
was the painting of the Ist Australian
Divisional Artillery going into action
before Ypres, considered the best war
picture shown at the Royal Academy in
1919. The show will open on August 23.
The fashion shows are trying to per-
suade us that spring is i-cumen in. They
are meeting with some success, too, for
while this Letter was slightly shuddering
at the silks and cottons, striped and dotty,
that a duchess of design was displaying,
two women near her were nimbly buy-
ing. One rapturously purchased a yellow
pique dress with puff sleeves, laced up
the front to the throat, peasant style, and
finished off with a wide belt of the pique
stiff with rows of stitching; also an even-
ing frock of black cire satin. When this
satin turns up labelled lacquered it’s the
same thing, and is notable for its dull
surface.
If possible, next December will find
us gone still more feminine than last.
A stiffened yellow muslin, sleeveless, but
with the upper-arm bareness demurely
softened by a cape collar finished centre
front with a cameo, had pinned to its
spreading and buoyant skirts gloves of
the same material. These gloves are not
hard to make, and the girl clever with
her needle will be able to have a pair
to match every frock.
Jumpers are to be of the dear little
variety. They are nearly all in cotton
or linen thread, sometimes so thick as to
suggest the old macrame, crocheted or
worked in more or less open designs.
They are seductive till you look at the
price tickets. That’s when the wage-
earner bites the bullet. About the neck-
line we will go dolled up with muslin
cravats, with butterfly bows, with Quaker-
like muslin collars.
Concerning colors, a woman just back
from London declares that navy-and-
white is the strongest runner in the race,
but admits beiges, wheat-yellows, black-
and-white and dusky blues have plenty
of supporters. And don’t forget that the
shoulder in new modes is still all-im-
portant. A very good thing for the de-
portment are these aggressive shoulders;
to get the best out of an epaulette or
wide shoulderline you must walk erect.
Sleeves smack of the Victorian, and so
do the hats, higher at the back than the
front, which are as easy to wear as the
seasonable pussy-bow.
A week or two ago the girls of Sydney
High celebrated the jubilee of their
school. Last Friday it was the boys’
turn, and a bright night they made of
it in the Blaxland Galleries. Here the
school pennant had pride of place be-
neath the balcony; the menus were illus-
trated with the photographs of the first
building in Elizabeth-street, the second
one at Pyrmont and the handsome build-
ing at Moore Park —the school’s present
home. There was insistence on the num-
bers 1883 and 1933 in the decorations of
the official table. The Governor and Lady
Game, who wore rose satins, were re-
ceived by the president of the Old Boys’
Union, Dr. S. A. Smith, and Mrs. Smith,
and the vice-regal lady was presented
with a posy of daffodils and violets tied
with the school chocolate and blue. Four
at least of the school’s first scholars were
at the dance: present headmaster G. C.
Saxby, Arthur Eedy, H. F. Halloran and
William Toms. There was an outsize
group of representatives of other schools,
among them the R. C. M. Boyces, who
carried the congratulations of the coun-
cil of the G.P.S. Old Boys Unions. Mrs.
Hawdon Wilson, whose little velvet
jacket wore crystal buttons; Lorraine
Smith, who glittered in silver lame, and
the C. R. Smiths (he was a former head-
master) were among the night’s noted:
Up at the tiny Tom Thumb Theatre
last Saturday “A Dramatic Fragment,”
by an unnamed author, and four of
Dulcie Deamer’s Morality plays formed
the programme. Two, “The Heart of a
Woman” and “The Mind of a Child,”
had already been produced ; “The Soul
of a Man” and “Easter” made their first
public appearance. There was great en-
thusiasm for the plays, which are at once
poetic and dramatic, and for their author
(who had acted in two of them) when she
appeared at the end of the final curtain.
Producer Charlie Cunnington, the vital
force in this group of amateurs who
toil in the cause of the Australian
drama, was overwhelmed when his labor
of love was commemorated by a spark-
ling gold cigarette case, presented to him
on the stage while the cast and the club
members gathered around and sang
lustily “For he’s a jolly good fellow.”
The Old Boys’ Union of the Christian
Brothers’ school at Lewisham has attained
its majority, and a key, golden and large
enough to open a giant’s doorway, was
a decoration of the official table. It had
the number 21 outlined in blue flowers,
and was tied with the light and royal
blues of the college. Three of the school’s
principals and representatives from other
educational fastnesses were at the table,
presided over by 0.8. U. president Quinn,
whose wife illumined her black velvets
with silver sequins. The Blaxland Gal-
leries were the scene of the gaieties.
Mrs. Walter Swinson’s is the expert
hand responsible for arranging the pro-
gramme that will fill the Royal Empire
Society’s rooms with a rich harmony to-
morrow evening. Rene Maxwell, Vladi-
mir Elin, Athos Martelli, George White
and George Taylor are the artists who
will make songs for the Empireans’
delight.

Chatter
At Moonee Valley on Saturday the
dressing seemed uncommonly good ;
wintry, of course, but bright, comfort-
able and decidedly expensive. Furs were
allied to most tailored costumes and
coats. Suits were mostly of the close-
fitting variety rather than the new baggy
mode. Millinery was mostly of the toque
or pill-box form, in velvet or felt, with
a feather or a quill popped in at a raky
angle.
Among those who watched the racing
were General Wisdom, Colonel and Mrs.
Eric Harrison and Mr. and Mrs. Ross
Grey Smith (Mrs. Smith’s horse, Boy
Blue, was favorite in the Amateurs’
Steeple, but failed). The Blair lady, from
Queensland, sported a rose-red repp
coat and skirt, furs and a black velour
hat. Showing her round was Mrs. T. J.
Ryan, a study in grey in suit and felt
hat. Mrs. E. A. Kimpton was all in
brown, and Mrs. Neunhoffer was coated
in cocoa-dyed squirrel. The Luxton lady
was in black. Mrs. Terence Butler, from
the Apple Isle, wrapped in a squirrel coat
over a blue frock, was accompanied by
tweed-suited Nancy Hewlett, and Betty
Parbury wore a bright-blue coat and
matching felt hat.
The dance of P.L.C. Old Collegians at
St. Kilda Town Hall brought forth a
bunch of debs, to curtsey to the slim
dark-haired, dark-eyed president of the
0.C.A., Kathleen Stobie. The 16 comers-
out were all in white, with garlands of
pink sweet-peas dangling from their right
wrists. The dance was on cabaret lines,
with parties gathered round tables decor-
ated with Iceland poppies. The school’s
colors—black, navy and gold—were fes-
tooned amid the crimson and yellow
lanterns that trimmed the hall. One bud
added an attractive touch to a simple
georgette frock with a cape that was all
fussy frills of white tulle. Another
sported a delustred velvet gown in prin-
cess mode, with long puffed sleeves. Miss
Scobie, who carried a presentation posy,
was in turquoise-blue georgette with
draped corsage and sleeves showered
with rhinestones, which were also scat-
tered over the back panel of her trained
skirt. Essie Mollison, hon. secretary of
the 0.C.A., sported cornflower-blue lace
with a matching coat of georgette
touched up with squirrel fur. At the
principal table were Mrs. J. Mirams,
president of the P.L.C.O.C. Club ; Miss
H. A. Thomas, hon. treas. ; Frances
Fraser, Mrs. I. H. Moss, Mrs. E. S.
Richards, Principal Gray and Mrs. Gray.
Bonnie Kellett, who had a pansy-hued
velvet cape topping a pale-green lace
frock, and Coralie Gardiner, in pastel-
blue georgette, were secretaries of the
hop. Others who gave aid were Elma
Watson, whose velvet robe was worn
with a bottle-green cape ; Betty Melville,
who favored golden brown, and Doris
Moore, who was in black—all three

accompanied by her finance John Foster,
came in peacock-blue velvet. Lesley See-
kamp’s taffeta frock was sky blue, and
Izobel Duncan was there in ecru lace.
The Australian Corps Signals’ Officers’
mess had a dance at Ormond Hall.
Colonel O. F. Metcher, the president of
the organising committee, brought his
wife, whose black velvet robe had ecru
lace on the corsage. Lieutenant R. A.
Hollingsworth was hon. sec. Major and
Mrs. R. T. A. McDonald, she in filmy
black face gown, and Major and Mrs. H.
Pain were specially invited guests.
On Friday night the Uni. women
students gave a hop at St. Kilda Palais
de Danse. Stephanie Clark, who chose
a black velvet robe, and Margaret Pear-
son, in an unusual frock of dull blue
delustred velvet with a tracery of pink
embroidery, were the secretaries. Presi-
dent Elizabeth Pearson wore floral-pat-
terned chiffon, blending mole and lacquer
tones. Prof. Agar’s wife was in black
flat crepe that had touches of gold.
Newman College students had then-
dance at the Wattle Path, St. Kilda. Mrs.
A. L. Kenny and the matron of New-
man, Miss N. Egan, hostessed for the
committee, both receiving posies which
cheered up their black lace draperies.
Rector Murphy welcomed representatives
of other seats of learning. Uni. Vice-
Chancellor Barrett came with his lady,
whose brown grosgrain silk gown had a
blurred design in pink. Prof, and Mrs.
Agar, Enid Joske of Janet Clarke Hall,
who chose a gown of black velvet, and D.
K. Picken, Master of Ormond, with Mrs.
Picken, were amongst those specially
invited.
As a prelude to the R.S.S.I.L. confer-
ence there was a ball at St. Kilda Town
Hall, to which representatives of the
Navy, Army and Air Force were invited.
The State president, G. W. Holland, and
his wife, who wore a gown of black
velvet, welcomed the guests. Mayor and
Mayoress Johnson, of St. Kilda, were
there.
The red, gold and black colors of the
Ormond Women’s Association were
trailed about the damask between crystal
vases of wattle and Iceland poppies for
the annual dinner at the Lyceum Club.
Honored guests were Uni. Chancellor
MacFarland, Master of Ormond D. K.
Picken and his wife, and the president of
the Old Ormond Men’s Association, Dr.
Anderson, and his wife. Mrs. J. G.
Latham, president of the 0.W.A., was in
the chair, wearing draperies of amethyst
hue, with a coatee of deeper shade. Mar-
garet Davies, who lately returned from
Korea, described some of her experiences.
Broothorn made this picture of Mrs.
M. M. Phillips, wife of the Master in
Equity in Melbourne. A keen charity
worker, she is at present honorary organ-
iser of collections on behalf of the Dis-
trict Nursing Society, of which she is a
vice-president. Among her interests are
the Kindergarten Union’s holiday home
for which she recently ran a very success-
ful bridge party at the Green Mill, and
the Lyceum Club, of which she has been
a member almost from its inception.
Mrs. Phillips has filled at various times
the offices of president and hon. secre-
tary, and she is still hon. treasurer.
In aid of the Ladies’ Work Association
there was a bridge gathering at the Vic-
toria, organised by the president Mrs.
A. M. Treacy, Mrs. L. K. S. Mackinnon,
Mrs. Joseph Levi, the Howse lady, Mrs.
S. J. Staughton and Miss E. Parker.
Mrs. Harry Emmerton and Mrs.
Arthur Hordern hostessed a tea-gathering
at the Victoria League when the Hood
lady and her daughter, Mrs. R. H.
Bryson (remembered here as Florence
Hood the violinist) were honored guests.
In the throng were the Miller, Best and
Spencer ladies, Mrs. Herbert Brookes,
Mrs. F. W. Eggleston and Mary Enimer-
ton.
The League of Youth, which has for
its object the protection of Australia’s
flora and fauna, was launched the other
day with a great deal of speechifying.
The league is Ambrose Pratt’s idea, and
is being warmly supported in Govern-
mental and other influential circles. It is
being administered for the time being by
the Education Department, but soon a
representative committee will be appointed
to take charge.
This is Mary Campbell, who has been
the mentor of many of Melbourne’s most
successful vocalists. She was a student
at the Albert-street Con. in Marshall
Hall’s time, and was a pupil of Madame
Weidermann. Miss Campbell had two
years of study in Berlin, and was for
many years in close association with
Melba as chief teacher of singing at the
Con., in which the diva was so greatly
interested. This post Miss Campbell still
holds. It was to her energy and en-
thusiasm that much of the success of the
recent season at the Garrick Theatre of
the musical play “The Immortal Hour”
was due. Soloists and chorus were under
her supervision.
Helen, only daughter of the J. E.
Haypes, South Yarra, had a spring-like
setting for her wedding with Thomas,
elder son of Mrs. Edward Manifold, of
Camperdown, at St. John’s, Toorak. She
wore a long-sleeved, trained gown of
white satin, over which coursed a cloud
of tulle held by a wreath of orange buds.
Jean Ferguson, Joan Syme, Joyce Ham-
mond and Kitty Currie attended her in
frocks of pale-green delustred velvet.
Shortish veils of tulle depended from
bandeaux of velvet, and they wore velvet
mittens. Guests assembled for a wedding
tea at Shipley House, where pink roses,
camellias and irises made the decorations.
Lines from Perth:
The Playbox group extended a welcome to
Athene Seyler, Nicholas Hannen and their co.
Mrs. Rose Atkinson made introductions, shuf-
fling and reshuffling groups to keep the ball of
chatter . rolling. Miss Seyler warmed her
shoulders with a plainly-cut bridge coat of
diminutive floral design. Her youthful daughter
Hermione wore a red ribbon round her sleek
head. Cecily Clarence was there and Maureen
O’Moor, all gleaming white satin, with her
doctor husband at her elbow. Margaret Sharp
and Messrs. Dick and Raynor played a trio;
Charles Gordon sang and Mrs. Braine recited.
Postman and telegraph-boy had an extra
spurt of work on Mrs. S. F. Moore’s 89th
birthday. The venerable lady was at-home to
a host of relatives and friends in her old stone
house with its gorgeous view of Freshwater
Bay. She was one of the State’s pioneers. In
her memory tales of hardships of the early
settlers are mingled with glittering receptions at
Government House, and long moonlight drives
to dances and picnics. Born m Tahiti, she
came to this State in her early girlhood. As
a bride she lived at Dongarra.
Hugo Throssell has established a ranch on
Greenmount Hill. The steeds, which include
brumbies, long of wool a«d thick of leg, are
rounded up alongside stalls of fruit and cream,
turkeys and rabbits on the hoof and an archery
target. The gee-gees are named after Katharine
Prichard’s books —Black Opal, Coonardoo, and
the rest. They are offered for hire per hour
or day.
Knight James Mitchell and his lady are busy
as bees packing their valuables and disposing
of the accumulations old houses are wont to
harbor. Twenty-eight years ago they built
their Northam home, which they are leaving for
the greater spaciousness of Government House.
Annals of Adelaide’s winter:
At the Uni. Dance Club’s ball two debs., the
Campion sisters, curtsied to Vice-Chancellor
Mitchell and the joint presidents of the club,
Dr. and Mrs. Rex Matters. Mrs. Matters wore
a frock of white lace and a coatee of white
crush ring velvet. The committee presented her
with a shoulder spray of white hyacinths.
There was a civic reception to J. and T.
Spivakovsky and E. Kurtz, held in the Mayor-
ess’s room. The acting-Mayoress (Mrs. J. R.
Cain) wore a brown ensemble with brown hat
and fur. Her daughter, Mrs. H. Dunstan, was
in a brown coat with marmot fur collar and a
velour hat to match. Mrs. J. Spivakovsky, who
is the guest of her parents, Mr. and Mrs. H.
Krantz, has just presented her husband with
a baby.
L’Alliance Francaise held its ball at Birk’s
Piccadilly with floral decorations in red, white
and blue. The president, W. W. Goodhart,
received the guests, and two buds, Shirley Nock
and Catherine Jenkins, were presented to the
vice-presidents, Mrs. Lavington Bonython, in
floral chiffon gown and a shoulder cape of
scarlet ring velvet, and Mrs. H. S. Hudd, in
black taffeta with a black velvet coatee. Mar-
celle Berardi sang French songsL
A hop at the Mount Osmond Country Club
was attended by His Ex. and Lady Hore-
Ruthven. _ Autumn foliage and poinsettia
featured in the decorations. President E. W.
Holden and his wife received. Mrs. Holden
wore ivory crinkled crepe with turquoise-blue
velvet outlining the corsage. Lady Hore-
Ruthven was in a terra-cotta toned marocain
gown cut on diagonal lines. She was accom-
panied by Rosemary Fleischmann, who was
frocked in lemon chiffon merging into tango,
with an ostrich boa to match.
Old scholars of Loreto Convent had their
dance in Australia Hall. Guests were received
by the president, Mrs. W. J. Denny, smart in
silver-grey crinkled crepe moulded to the figure,
and the vice-president, Mrs. Molony, who wore
a modish frock of black crushed ring velvet.
The L. Osmond Pounds have left England ert
route for their future home at Colombo. They
have been in England ever since their marriage
in Adelaide at the beginning of the year. Mrs.
Osmond Pound was presented at the last Court,
when she wore her wedding dress. .
The Speck’s potpourri:—-
Frocking at Elwick was smart and suitable.
Big sportsmanlike coats covered bright woollens
and the attractive small hats of the moment
were in evidence everywhere. In the throng
were Mr. and Mrs. Thos. Lyons, the Russell
Ibbotts, Mrs. Fred Grant, Mrs. Walter Gelli-
brand, the Ashbolt lady, the H. C. Ikins, the
Norman Fergusons, Dr. and Mrs. Ratten, Mr.
and Mrs. Cyril Lewjs, the Geo. Canns, the
Gordon Blews, the Bruce Gibsons, the Stacey
girls, Wanda Piesse, Maisie Sharp, Alison Page,
Mrs. L. M. Mullen and Mrs. W. Wolfhagen.
At the King’s Meadows golf clubhouse (Laun-
ceston) Miss Rendle Harper, who has been the
associates’ secretary for 18 years, was pre-
sented, on her resignation, with a shooting-
stick and morocco handbag. Mrs. G. H. Hogg,
president of the associates, said appropriately
nice things, and then entertained everyone at
tea. Later in the afternoon Mrs. T. A. Field
and Anne 'Clemons won the president’s trophy
in a Canadian foursome.
Violinist David Feirclough has founded
another orchestra in Hobart. It made its debut
at the Memorial Hall in a very good pro-
gramme. Esma Green was accompanist to the
soloists, who came in between the orchestral
items.
Mrs. Kay (Melb.), who has been in the
Speck for some weeks, has gone back, taking
with her her sisters, Mrs. Young and the two
Misses Chambers, and niece Betty Tencken.
They will all spend the rest of the winter on
the mainland.
Miss E. Thompson, visiting the Speck to re-
new acquaintances made when she brought out
a hockey team in 1927, was the guest of Miss
Fox, principal of the Methodist Ladies’ Col-
lege.
Longford Show Ball, at the Forester.’s Hall,
was a swish affair. Bridge was played up-
stairs. The dance room was decorated in three
shades of pink, and the supper tables were
blushful in the same hues. Mrs. G. Wayn
and Miss Brodribb were joint secs.
J. McLaren Morris, manager of the Bank
of N.S.W. at Devonport for nine years, has
been transferred to Sunshine, Victoria. The
Devonport Golf Club, the Devonport Club and
Toe. H. farewelled him.
Launceston’s hospital auxiliaries have been
busy of late. Dr. and Mrs. Ramsay, Ruglen, .
had a day of bridge, afternoon and evening, for
a start, and lectures, more bridge parties and
musical shows were run during the week.
Great regret is felt in the North at the sudden
passing of Lance Archer, Longford Hall, a well-
known figure in pastoral and sporting circles.
He was a skilful big-game hunter and made
two trips to Africa elephant hunting, bringing
back many trophies.

William O’Connor, of St. Leonard’s
Hill, Daylesford (Vic.), wagered that he
could cut and split 7 cords (17y tons) of
sft. firewood, 50ft. to the ton, in
one day. He did it in 10 hours. In the
first hour he cut and split \\ cords, or
34 tons, beating the record (a Melbourne
policeman’s) by 20 minutes. He filled a
railway truck, which holds 7 cords, and
had one load to spare. There were 14
drays to cart the load to the station.

History repeats itself. An item from
New York tells of a goldsmith who
regularly played the trick of wearing a
well-greased thatch, fingering gold-dust,
and wiping his fingers on his hair, thus
carrying away nightly a good deal of
gold. He is now in gaol. Old resi-
dents will remember the hirsute bank
manager of a N.S.W. up-country town,
who, when a digger came to sell gold,
used to finger it carelessly, and then,
with some simple remark such as “It
seems very light gold,” would carelessly
place his hands on his head and adopt
a thoughtful Napoleonic attitude. Then
he would weigh the digger’s dust, pay
for it, and bow him out. One day a
digger suddenly returned to ask some
question. Not seeing the manager behind
the counter, and the sitting-room door
being open, the digger walked right on
and in. He found Mr. Manager dusting
his head with his hands, the gold falling
in a fine shower upon a spread-out paper
disposed for its reception. That acquisi-
tive dodger was duly “sent up.”
[3/10/’9l.]
A German steamer was going up the
St. Augusta River, German N.G., and
landed a crew at a village. A photo-
grapher was aboard, and he landed also,
with a view of “taking” a group of
natives. After immense trouble and
many failures he got the niggers to stand
still, and, proceeding to the camera, put
his head under the cloth. Whizz! a
shower of spears! Again
he got the duskies quiet,
and again—spears! He
gave it best. [9 /1 / ’92.]
A lady who lately
visited Gounod says:
“Sometimes in the dead
of night an inspiration
would come to him.
He’d spring out of bed,
light the gas, start to
work and disturb the
whole house. His pet
whim was to lie abed in
the morning and play
cards with two pretty
housemaids seated at a
small table by the bed-
side. He was partial to
a horrible red shirt, he
often forgot to wash, but
his conversation enchant-
ed the listener, and made
one oblivious to his out-
ward self.”
[2l/11 / ’9l.]
Old John Cox, of
Mangoplah, was the
most popular man in the
Wagga district, ior his
hand was ever in his
pocket, and he was
always ready to do a
good turn to anybody he
liked. Amongst others
indebted to him for kind-
nesses was Pat the
brewer. Some time after
Cox’s death Pat came to
Wagga at Circuit time,
and on his way back to
Albury he was accom-
panied by a certain bar-
rister and a Crown Law
official. They were tra-
velling by a back-track
to Germanton, and on
the way they had to pass the Wagga
cemetery, where poor Cox’s bones lay.
“Shtop,” said Pat, who was pretty well
“on.” “We must say a prayer over poor
John Cox’s grave.” Accordingly, the trio
dismounted from the buggy, and, after
search, the grave was found. “Do any of
yez know the day profundis ?” inquired
Pat. “I’ll thry,” said the barrister, who
proceeded to repeat the psalm in Latin,
but, after a line or two, broke down.
Nor was the Crown Law official a bit
more successful in English. At last Pat
lost patience and said: “Shtop ; I’ll say
a prayer meself. God bless you, John
Cox, wherever you are!” [7/11 /’9l.]
Probably the most notable Aus-
tralian aborigine has just “gone over”
in the person of Johnny Mullagh, the
cricketer. Mullagh in his day was a
grand all-round athlete, and his fine phy-
sical proportions and intelligent speech
tempted the “Saturday Review” to dub
him “the finest specimen of a savage
ever seen in England.” Mullagh, who
spoke English as clearly as an educated
white, was looked upon as a very
superior person by his fellow-blacks; in
fact, he was generally addressed as “Mr”
Mullagh. Bullocky, another of the team
taken to England by Lawrence, was one
day playing against his compatriot at
Coleraine, and, as usual, had been in-
dulging in the rosy. Consequently he
swiped a little too soon at one of Mul-
lagh’s tempters, and the result proved
fatal. When passing the bowler, Mul-
lagh said, “What made you slog at that
one, Bullocky?” “Well, Mr. Mullagh,”
was the response, “I bin see two balls,
and 1 hit at the wrong one.” Mullagh
was the last of his tribe. Though quite
black he was comely, his profile being of
a pronounced Semitic type. [5/9/ 91.]
“Billy” Florence used to tell this yarn
of his early struggling days. To cele-
brate a rise in salary of another dollar
per week he treated his sweetheart (sub-
sequently Mrs. F.) to a banquet of
oysters and lemonade in a New York
sdloon. On going to the counter to pay
he found his pockets empty, and, as pool
Juliet was also bare of capital, a dis-
tressing scene ensued. The oyster-man
sneered aloud when Florence gave him
an address at a theatre. He would put
no trust in theatrical princes and pre-
ferred to send for the police. Just then
a grave, long-bearded man stepped for-
ward. His cheek flushed with indigna-
tion as he called attention to the evident
respectability of the young couple, and
begged the honor of settling their oyster
account on the spot. Planking down a
ten-dollar bill and picking up the change
with a careless, haughty air that made
the purveyor of shell-fish realise his own
meanness, the venerable stranger escorted
Florence and his frightened girl out of
the place. They both showered thanks
upon their friend-in-need, and Florence
asked for his card, with a view of re-
HOSTILE FEET.
SMALL BOY (looking at old gentleman’s feet): “Why
don’t you sit down on the kerb and let ’em
fight it out, guv’nor?”

paying the oyster loan and expressing
more gratitude next morning. “Never
mind that,' 5 said the old gentleman, “I
did very well out of that affair. It was
a bad ten-dollar bill.” He whisked round
the corner and Florence never saw him
again. [l6/1/ ’92.]
We don’t hear as much about the
Sydney tailors’ strike as we used to
[writes Sappho Smith], but there is at least
one man in Sydney who will never forgive
nor forget it. A Sydney hostess —presid-
ing genius of an establishment to which
he had long and hungrily wished for the
right of familiar entree —invited him to
an afternoon at home, and he, meaning
to blossom like a dummy in brand-new
rags, went on his knees to his own par-
ticular ninth part of a man and begged
him to run up a suit by such and such a
day. The day came, and the youth joy-
ously hied him to dress at his tailor’s,
but, alas! owing to the belligerent attitude
of the wielders of the yard-measure, the
garments were still in dock! The tailor,
seeing he had a desperate man to deal
with, hit on a desperate expedient. “We
are much of the same height,” he said,
“I will lend you one of my suits —but
remember, I must have it back before
the shop shuts at 6 p.m.” Of course, the
frantic dude adopted the conditions,
arrayed himself and went, and so in-
gratiated himself with the hostess that he
was warmly pressed to stay and dine.
Then the iron thraldom in which he was
held by his tailor’s suit of clothes
obtruded itself. He refused in the most
embarrassed manner the soft pressure of
the lady, and at 5.30 fled precipitately
from his Paradise, mortally offending the
hostess by his unfaltering haste. He got
the get-up back on contract time —a
hollow consolation, for Mrs. de Potts
Point has never seemed to see him since!

LTNES ON A CORYPHEE.
She was such a bright little minx,
Though also the greatest of flirts-
Her legs were as long as her drinks.
And her temper as short as her skirts.
THE SHAME OF GOING BACK.
When you’ve come to make a fortune and
you haven’t made your salt,
And the reason of your failure isn’t anybody’s
fault—
When you haven’t got a billet, and the times
are very slack,
There is nothing that can spur you like the
shame of going back;
Crawling home with empty pockets,
Going back hard-up,
Oh! It’s then you learn the meaning of
“humiliation’s cup.”
When the place and you are strangers and
you struggle all alone,
And you have a mighty longing for the town
where you are known;
When your clothes are very shabby and the
future’s very black,
There is nothing that can hurt you like the
shame of going back;
Going home with empty pockets,
Crawling back hard-up;
Oh! It’s then you know the meaning of
“humiliation’s cup.”
When we’ve fought the battle bravely and are
beaten to the wall,
’Tis the sneers of men, not conscience, that
make cowards of us all;
And the while you are returning, oh, your
brain is on the rack,
And your heart is in the shadow of the shame
of going back;
Going home with empty pockets,
Going back hard-up;
Then you know the bitter meaning of
“humiliation’s cup.”
When a beaten man’s discovered with a bullet
in his brain
They post-mortem him, and try him, and they
say he was insane;
But it*very often happens that he’d lately “got
the sack,”
And his onward move was owing to the shame
of going back;
Going back with empty pockets,
Going home hard-up;
Oh! it’s then you know the meaning of
“humiliation’s cup.”
Ah! my friend, you call it nonsense, and your
sneering lip is curl’d,
I can see that you have never worked your
passage through the world;
But when fortune rounds upon you and the
rain is on the track,
You will learn the bitter meaning of the shame
of going back;
Crawling home with empty pockets,
Going home hard-up;
Oh, you’ll taste the bitter poison in
“humiliation’s cup.”

HENRY LAWSON.


The Kris of Power.
BY M. G. SKIPPER.
THE night had closed down on all the
lymphatic activities of the hot little
coastal town. The full blaze of the
tropical day had changed quickly to a
brief twilight, into which the bats had
emerged, momentarily stringing them-
selves across the pink sky like a fantastic
necklace. Flying foxes had flapped
heavily across the straits from Bali. The
air was full of insect life.
Fullarton left his bungalow and started
on his evening stroll, which always ended
at Gruyter’s. As he left his verandah,
stuffing chocolate into his pocket for
Gruyter’s children, with an extra-large
piece for little Sien, his “boys” were
beginning to light the lamps. Elfin
screams rang out from the depths of his
garden. A hoarse voice shouted a chal-
lenge, repeating its note thirteen times.
Parchment wings beat in his face.
Fullarton turned into the unlighted
road, lined with the black shapes of trees
swarming with fantastically articulated
limbs. He passed the dim walls of kam-
pongs behind which the voices of an
unseen multitude, clustered inside their
houses, seemed like the terrified mur-
murs of night-fearing children. A trem-
bling, wind-bound fisherman overtook
him, blowing on his torch. He passed
a group of ghost-ridden mourners in the
open front of a shop, beating drums and
droning mantras round a brownish red
corpse lighted by the gleam of a kerosene
lamp.
There was no mystery in the night for
him. He had always been amused at
the way a few years’ residence in Java
turned stolid Dutch burghers, whom he
met in his job of introducing native
consumers to Australian manufactures,
into fantastic mystics, and believers in
the occult. He turned out of one dark
lane into another and saw the white
front of Gruyter’s toko gleaming at the
end of it without quickening his stride.
Going up the steps of the shop he
passed the Regent and his appas. He
knew the awed deference, the adulation
almost amounting to worship, which the
Javanese show to their princes, who,
descended from Hindu demigods through
long lines of ruling families, still retain
an appearance of authority under the
unostentatious suzerainty of the Dutch;
and he stood aside politely, replying to
the Regent’s stately salutation by rais-
ing his hat.
The shop was empty except for
Gruyter’s mandur, who was crouching in
a corner staring straight before him. The
native seemed terrified at something.
“Overcome by the imminence of
royalty,” thought Fullarton, grinning to
himself.
In a few minutes the little half-caste
Dutchman emerged from the back
premises. Fullarton noted at once that
he was suffering from some complicated
emotion. In the expression of his face
fear and triumph seemed to be
struggling for mastery. His skin, strongly
tinged with native pigment, had gone
ashy white and his black goatee trembled
with the shaking of his chin, but his
bright little eyes danced with excitement.
“Verdikke ! ” he said, “is it you, myn-
heer? I thought it was the Adipati back
again,” and he ran down the steps to
watch the torch carried by the Regent’s
attendant out of sight. Then he went
behind his counter and began to re-
arrange with trembling fingers the rows
of jars and bottles of wines and spirits
on the shelves.
Fullarton quietly smoked one of
Gruyter’s cigars and made no comment.
“ Kom, mynheer,” said Gruyter, sud-
denly, “you understand and you do not
fear. I will show you.”
Fullarton, his curiosity mildly aroused,
followed the storekeeper into his office.
Closing the door the Dutchman went to
a small safe, and after a good deal of
fumbling extracted from it an object
wrapped in sarong cloth.
“Look but,” he said in a tremulous
whisper, putting the parcel carefully in
Fullarton’s hands, “ Kalamoonyangl ”
Fullarton removed the wrappings and
looked at the object in his hands.
Although he had never seen it before, he
knew what it was. The existence in the
Regent’s palace of the famous kris had
always appealed to Fullarton’s matter-of-
fact passion for collecting anything of
value which came his way. Kalamoon-
yang was held in superstitious venera-
tion throughout Java and had a splendid
and bloody history. Fullarton had
heard many stories of its miraculous
powers and the operation of its vindic-
tive hate, stories told by awed natives
and retailed by credulous Hollanders.
But his hands were steady as he held
the kris up to the light and examined
its dark and glittering blade, adorned
with the royal pattern of nagu-heads.
“How did you come by it?” asked
Fullarton.
Gruyter poured out gin and com-
menced a long and rambling story.
From the tangled stream of Dutch and
Malay, Fullarton learned that Gruyter
was an honest man, that the kris was
his, fairly and squarely his —in fact, he
had the agreement in his safe. You
know what these Javanese princes are.
A shiftless lot. Always in debt over a
wedding or a festival. Always ready
to pledge their pensions before they have
earned them.
Gruyter had been good to the Regent
before, damned good to him. Had
often advanced him a hundred guilders
on no security but his aristocratic word
of honor. Hadn’t always been repaid,
either. The Regent calls on him, says
he’s going to Sourabaya by the morning
train and will be back in two days. Wants
a loan of a thousand dollars, and will
pay it back with interest at ten per cent,
per day.
Fair enough terms for a native, but
no good to Gruyter. He knows the
Regent is in a damned bad way, is sus-
pected by Government of squeezing
bribes out of the people. He might be
deposed to-morrow and where would
Gruyter’s money be? No, Gruyter can’t
do it. Must have security. He will take
Kalcunoonyang as security. The Regent
can have the money if he leaves the
sacred kris with Gruyter, and he can
have Kalamoonyang back if he repays
his debt, plus ten per cent, per day,
within the forty-eight hours.
The Regent goes mad, or as mad as
a Javanese aristocrat will allow himself
to go, but at last he agrees. So he brings
the kris to Gruyter that night, wrapped
in a bit of cloth, and gets the thousand
guilders and goes off to Sourabaya.
Gruyter’s cupidity momentarily mas-
tered his fear. His voice rose to an
exultant shriek. Of course the fool
doesn’t come back! Doesn’t turn up
for five days. Perhaps he fancied
Gruyter would never dare to keep the
kris, or perhaps he was having such a
good time in Sourabaya with a new girl
that he never gave the thing a thought.
Kasiehan! It had been a terrible
scene just now, a terrible scene! The
sweat came out on Gruyter’s sallow skin
at the recollection of it. Not that the
Regent had shown any disposition to
start amokking about the kris. No! He
never even raised his voice above its
usual level tones. When he understood
Gruyter’s intention was to hold him to
his bond, he had offered twice the
money, without avail. Then he had
taken his leave ceremoniously.
Well, there it was! There was Kala-
moonyang, and there was the agreement,
and there was the Regent going home
along the dark street, without his kris
but with Gott knew what black hells
of hate and vengeance in his heart.
But bah! he was not afraid of the
Regent. The Regent would not dare to
do anything to a white man these days.
It was the kris. He had already begun
to repent of his bargain ; but he knew the
native pride. There would have to be
fresh blood — his blood —on it before the
Regent would take it back.
Fullarton looked closely at the kris,
with its dark, flamelike blade, the blade
which had flown of its own volition
against the Mohammedan enemy and
utterly routed them, which had taken a
bloody part in a hundred court intrigues,
had drunk the lives of queens and
princes. He tried its temper against the
wall. He leant' casually over the win-
dow-sill and drove the point into the
trunk of a mango-tree whose dark green
leaves filled the sky outside.
“I’ll take the thing, if you like,” he
said indifferently, “and I’ll give you what
it cost you.”
At once Gruyter forgot his fears.
“ Kasiehan, mynheer,” he said, “You
do not comprehend. The kris is price-
less. Batavia museum would be glad
to give me 20,000 guilder for it, if the
Government would allow the sale. Still,
you are my good friend. I will let you
have it for ten thousand.”
“A thousand guilders!” said Fullar-
ton, putting the kris back into Gruyter’s
shrinking hands.
He walked along the verandah as far
as Gruyter’s nursery and, pushing the
bamboo chicks on one side, peered in.
In that darkened room Gruyter’s half-
caste wife had just finished putting her
children to bed. Four cots stood in a
row, but Fullarton’s eyes passed cur-
sorily over the pillows supporting the
black little heads of Ot, Trui and Keesje
and sought the fourth. On that pillow
there seemed to rest a ray of golden
sunshine. Not the harsh sunshine of the
tropics but the tempered sunshine, as it
always seemed to Fullarton, of the
South.
Little Sien was an amazing pheno-
menon to find in a family like Gruyter’s.
She had the white skin, the cool, blue
eyes and the flaxen curls of a European
child. She had always attracted Fullar-
ton; and Gruyter himself was inordin-
ately proud of his atavistic creation.
Fullarton grinned at each child in
turn and threw a piece of chocolate on
each cot, with the extra large one for
Sientje.
The art of Oriental bargaining was
known to Fullarton, and for some days
he suspended his visits to Gruyter’s toko.
He went instead to the club, where he
heard all he wanted to hear. The whole
town was talking about Kalamoonyang.
Gruyter, they said, was mad to have
kept the kris. He might as well have
nursed a viper. Strange things had be-
gun to happen to him. A mango-tree
stabbed with the kris had died. Stones
fell on his roof in broad daylight, when
no throwers were to be seen. A shower
of mud had fallen inside his mosquito-
net. Worse things had happened ; they
could only be hinted at. Gruyter’s
servants had left him, all except his
mandur, who, having been to Mecca, was
impervious to occult influences.
When Fullarton next paid a visit to
the toko he found the little half-caste
in a state of nervous exultation.
“There now, mynheer,” Gruyter said,
“what for a blooty fool would I have
been to let you have the kris for one
thousand guilder! It is a poor thing,
that Kalamoonyang. It kills a tree, it
spoils my pony’s temper, it throws silly
stones on my roof. Pouf! What of
that. It cannot hurt me. Look but!”
He pulled up his sleeve and showed
Fullarton a thin green thread tightly
twisted round his arm.
“That is a jimat. That is strong magic.
It is stronger magic than Kalamoon-
yang!”
And he told Fullarton how he had
acquired from his mandur a thread from
the Prophet’s turban, guaranteed to be
proof against the pagan powers even of
Kalamoonyang.
“So now you will not sell the kris,”
said Fullarton quietly.
“Certainly I will sell. For thirty thou-
sand. Not a guilder under.”
“How is Sientje?” asked Fullarton,
after a pause.
Gruyter’s face lost its exultant look.
“Kasiehan! That child-, she is sick.
She always gets fever in the changing
months. She will be better when the wet
monsoon comes.”
Fullarton paid his usual visit to the
nursery. Sientje was lying back on her
pillow with her eyes closed, her cheeks
flushed with fever and her golden curls
damp with perspiration. Her mother lifted
her eyes, like the eyes of a water-buffalo,
from her child’s face and stared timidly
at Fullarton. The black eyes of the
other children sought Fullarton’s pocket,
but he could not think of chocolate while
Sientje was ill, Sientje whose golden hair
reminded him of southern suns.
One evening on his way to the club,
Fullarton was overtaken by the doctor.
“Mynheer,” said the doctor wobbling
wildly on his bicycle in an effort to keep
level, “you had better come with me
and see your little Siem She is very
sick. I like it not at all.”
Fullarton lengthened his stride, while
the doctor, zigzagging alongside him,
told him how Sientje’s fever was gone
now, yet Sientje was worse. It was that
verdomde kris, he went on angrily. What
else could it be? Who ever heard of
quinine turning a child?.... But, Myn-
heer Fullarton must see for himself.
Gruyter had seen them coming.
“Mein Gott, Doktor,” he cried, “you
are comq in good time! It is worse,
Doktor. It is terrible.”
Fullarton followed the doctor and
Gruyter into the nursery. Sientje was
lying as Fullarton had last seen her,
but there was no sign of sickness in her
face. Her blue eyes were bright, her
cheeks were cool and healthy-looking,
and round her head gleamed as fresh as
ever her aureole of golden curls.
Unbuttoning her nightdress, the doctor
looked intently at her chest, and beck-
oned Fullarton to come closer.
Fullarton bent over the cot. For a
few moments he thought his eyes were
deceiving him. The flimsy nightdress
seemed to be casting an extraordinarily
heavy shadow.
Then he realised what had happened.
Sientje’s beautiful skin below the neck
that pale skin that was her father’s pride
and glory, was no longer white. A
strange dark hue had spread over it. It
was not the dead tone of disease. It
seemed a healthy color, a glowing
natural bronze. The little white Sien
was turning black like her father.
Fullarton lingered in the shop after
the doctor had gone. “Well,” he said,
“do you still feel the same about the
kris?”
Gruyter flung his arm down.
“Gott smite the kris, mynheer. I wish
l had never seen it!”
“Very well, then; I will take it,” said
Fullarton.
“You will take it, mynheer? ” cried
Gruyter in amazement. “But you see,
it is envenomed. It can strike. See
what it has done!”
“I’m leaving for Australia,” said Ful-
larton, “so we’ll see what a white country
can do for it. I’ll have it for five
hundred.”
As Fullarton went down the steps
tucking Kalamoonyang under his arm,
he observed the mandur going through
the attitudes of the sembah, the grovel-
ling obeisance which is always performed
in the presence of their rulers by the
natives, but doing it to the kris.
Once more Fullarton’s ears were
assaulted by the coughs and groans, the
babble of strange noises, the sudden
whisperings of the tropical night swarm-
ing with unseen life. Without detecting
any note of menace in those sounds, his
mind subconsciously registered them all,
ascribing to each its unromantic origin.
He enjoyed a hearty dinner, and lay
back in a long chair on his verandah
afterwards, while a “boy” went to his
room to bring liqueurs and set the tray
of whisky and smokes that would see
him through the evening.
A shriek came from the interior of
the darkened house, followed by another.
He got up and went to his bedroom.
The first thing that caught his eye in the
light of an oil-lamp swinging from the
ceiling was Kalamoonyang lying on the
floor, its writhing blade, like a snake that
has struck, pointing across the room.
Following the direction of its undulating
curves Fullarton saw his “boy” propped
against the wall, his eyes fixed and star-
ing, his mouth fallen open and his hands
hanging down by their sides. He seemed
to Fullarton to be held in an upright
position simply by the stiff, starched
white uniform he wore.
The next moment the suit seemed to
crumple into a thousand creases and the
“boy” fell in a heap at his master’s feet.
Fullarton, turning the body over, saw
at once it was death; but he could find
no mark of violence on the body.
“Heart failure through funk,” he
muttered. Then, picking up the kris, he
looked curiously at the blade. Like a
dark, restless flame it lay in the palm of
his hand. At first Fullarton saw nothing
fresh to remark in the appearance of its
surface, brindled with ancient stains.
Then suddenly he whistled.
“Five on the right and six on the left.
It was the other way about.”
Every kris has an unequal number of
curves on its two edges. That evening
Fullarton had made a careful tracing
of Kalamoonyang. The kris he had
drawn had six undulations on the
right and five on the left. This that he
now held in his hand had the order
plainly reversed.
He stared at the body of his “boy.”
It impressed him less as a manifestation
of the kris’s alleged power than the fact
that he had made an error in the draw-
ing. The first was explainable; the other
was not. For a moment he had the desire
to get rid of the infernal thing, to fling
it from his verandah as far into the
night as he could; but he quickly mas-
tered the impulse.
“I must have had it turned the other
way,” he murmured, a little doubtfully;
and, opening a trunk stuffed with shirts
and singlets, he tossed the kris with
resentful violence into it.
A few weeks later Fullarton was pass-
ing his baggage through the Customs at
Sydney. “What’s this affair?” asked the
Customs officer, drawing Kalamoonyang
gingerly from its sheath.
“That is a little sticker that has drunk
the blood of kings and princesses.” said
Fullarton, smiling.
“Of course it has,” grinned the
Customs officer, dropping the kris back
amongst Fullarton’s shirts. “Chaps from
the parts you have come from always
have a fancy tale to tell about every-
thing.”
Fullarton smiled again. But this time
he was thinking with pleasure of his last
visit to Gruyter’s toko and of how the
half-caste had deluged him with thanks
for having been the means of restoring
the whiteness, the adored, beautiful
whiteness, to little Sientje’s body.

Gorilla Grogan.
BY CON DREW.
IT was after that split I had with Sledge-
hammer Joe that the thing I’m tellin
you of came about. I’d given up
managing boxers for a time and burst
into the wrestling game. If I’d known
what a pinhead I was I’d have stayed in
the cushion. They’ve got appetites like
sword-swallowers, them wrestlers. Before
I knowed where I was my roll had
shrunk so small it’d rattle inside a
napkin-ring.
So, of course, I gave the wrestlers up.
I slid into a quiet corner for a while,
and just as I’m getting so that I can tell
a copper by lookin’ at his feet I hitch
up with a heavyweight scrapper called
Gorilla Grogan.
Ever hear of Gorilla? He Wasn’t a
top-hole scrapper, if you can understand.
Nobody ran excursion trains to see him
when he was fighting; but he was strong
and tough. Thumps didn’t worry him no
more than the Man in the Iron Mask. A
pastime of his was to bang his head agen
his bedroom door to see which was the
hardest
Gorilla was just the sort of bloke
I wanted for touring, so I took him
on a jaunt out west, matching him with
boxers in the country towns.
The way we worked it was this. We’d
lob into a town, hitch up for a scrap
with the local champ, pull off the affray
as soon as possible and float on to the
next town.
In that way we worked as far as
Bourke and cleaned up good money.
Coming back, we stubbed our toes agen
a little town called Balroo.
There was racing on. Three days of
it. People were sleepin’ four in a room
at the pub Gorilla and me put up at,
and we were mighty lucky to get a
shakedown in the billiard-room.
. Well, we landed in Balroo just on tea-
time, and, after some scran, we were
havin’ a drink when who should I sight
in the bar but Snatcher Jervis, who used
to train fighters in Sydney. To look at
Snatcher you wouldn’t lend him a box of
matches without a banker’s reference, but
he understood fighters. None better. It
was him who trained Banana Harry when
he skittled Basher Murphy in half a
round, if you remember. Once Snatcher
had been a member of most of the lead-
ing sporting clubs, but he’d bitten his
way out of them all.
Leavin’ Gorilla to chin to the barman,
I waltzed across to Snatcher. As soon as
he seen me his face lit up like the door
of a coke oven.
“Saved!” he says, grabbin’ me by the
mitt and shakin’ it like a pump-handle.
“How so?” I asked him.
“Saved! ” he says again. “I read in the
paper you were touring the adjacent
landscape with Gorilla Grogan, and I’ve
been waiting for you to show up. You
must have been sent by Providence.”
“Make it as light as you can,” says
I, diving my hand into rry pocket. “The
roll ain’t too robust just at present.”
“Oh, it ain’t that,” he laughed. “It’s
something else.”
And then he gives me an earful of how
he’s got a local heavyweight under his
pinion who has bumped off a few third-
raters and is looked upon as a comer.
“This race crowd here,” says Snatcher,
“is just hoggin’ to see a scrap of some
sort. If we matched my bloke with
Gorilla it would fill the local hall.”
“I see,” I says. “What name might
your bloke be masqueradin’ under?”
“Staggs.”
“Come agen?”
“Staggs.”
“H’m,” I says. “Sounds like them
animals they stalk with bloodhounds.
Still, names ain’t everything, I’ll admit.
Can your bloke scrap?”
“Well,” says Snatcher, “he’s got all the
earmarks of a fighter.”
“Yes. But do he act like one when he
gets in the ring?”
“I can’t go so far as to say he does,”
Snatcher admits. “I’ve taught him a bit,
but he don’t take his thinkin’ exercises
too regular, if you can understand what
I mean.”
“Cobwebs in the belfry?”
“Ain’t quite as bad as that, but can’t
learn him to use his top-piece. He’s too
fond of rustlin' in and leaving himself
wide open. He don’t know no more
about defensive tactics than the Headless
Horseman. Still, he’s strong and willin’.”
“Now listen,” I says. “You’ve seen
Gorilla in action, haven’t you?”
“I have.”
“And you know he ain’t what you’d
call gentle.”
“I know all that.”
“Well, if your bloke’s shy on defence,
it would be as safe for him to be hangin’
around when Gorilla is swingin’ them
punches of his as it would be to try and
raise watermelons in Woolloomooloo.
Gorilla would flop him in half a round.
It wouldn’t be a match, and the crowd
here know it. They’ve been readin’ about
Gorilla in the papers.”
“Still, they’d come to see the fight just
the same.”
“Of course, they’d come,” I says; “and
they’d go early.”
Snatcher shoots a glance around to see
if anyone is earwigging. Then he leans
over and catches me by the coat lapel.
“Not if we fixed it so they wouldn’t
go early,” he whispered.
“Bah!” I says. “What’d be the good
of prolongin’ the agony?”
“Plenty of good.”
“As how?”
“Well, we could back my bloke,
couldn’t we?”
“Go on,” I says, beginnin’ to see how
the dice was rollin’.
“And Gorilla could take a flop?”
“Seein’ as it’s slack season with us, it
could be done,” says I. “Your bloke
ain’t got a putty jaw or nothin’ has he?”
“He’s got a jaw like a hippopotamus.”
“How about the pro-bonehead pub-
lico?”
“Oh, them!” says Snatcher. “They’re
just begging to get their ballast shifted.
1 ain’t got the heart to turn ’em down.”
Well, I called Gorilla over, and the
three of us swapped conversation for a
bit. The way we fixed it was this.
Gorilla and Staggs is to meet at the local
hall on Saturday night to decide who is
the dinkum champeen of the West. The
debate is to be advertised as for fifteen
rounds, but Gorilla is to take the thump
in the seventh. To give the crowd a run
for their money, Staggs is to be made
to think it’s dinkum and not let into the
know —or the chop-up. We reckoned
he’d fight all the harder for being kept
in the dark.
There was a slight disagreement re-
gardin’ the distribution of spoils. Finally
we arrange that Snatcher and me pool a
pony each and put the lot on Staggs, and
cut fifty-fifty of the winnings. Snatcher
to pay the rent of the hall. The scheme
was sound and fool-proof. Everything
was inkeybaloo.
Well, next day the paper gives it
out about the fight, and Gorilla and
Staggs goes into active training. Do the
sports get interested? I don’t mind
tellin’ you they do. We had four days
to get ’em thoroughly worked up. Gorilla
and Staggs gave sparring exhibitions,
taking on all-comers, and the whole town
rolled up to see them. All the talk was
about the fight, and betting was brisk.
Gorilla was favorite. Most of the
hardheads walloped their sugar on 1 him,
and Snatcher got our money on Staggs
at six to four.
I’d tipped Snatcher off to spill it round
that Gorilla had been saying things
about Staggs and it was to be a grudge
fight. So when we lobbed down at the
hall on Saturday night we found it
packed. No; packed ain’t the word. They
was jammed as close as paper to a wall.
Gents in clobber that dated back four
seasons filled the ringside seats, and at
the back of the hall there wasn’t stand-
ing-room. A dauntless dozen or two
were perched on the window-sills.
It didn’t take us long to get ready, and
as soon as I heard Staggs had entered
the ring I took Gorilla up and seated
him in his corner. All the jackals were
yelling their heads off for Staggs. He
was a husky gent with enough hair on
his chest to fill a mattress, and he un-
hinged the top of his face and grinned
back at the crowd. That brings more
cheerin’, and the place is a bedlam of
noise.
Well, I fixed the gloves on Gorilla, and
then the referee floats in, a chap they’d
brought especially from the neighboring
township. You can think how surprised
I was when I seen it was Three-Broad
Fred, a chap I used to knock about with
in Sydney. Once I’d been able to do him
a turn concernin’ a little matter about a
three-card game. He’d got into trouble
over some lads who still believed that
the eye is quicker than the hand, and

A ‘Bulletin" publication. Every Friday—2d.
when the coppers yarded him I came to
light with his fine. After that he dis-
appeared and I hadn’t seen him since.
We don’t get time for more than a
handshake before Three-Broad sends the
boys on their journey.
As soon as they got together I seen
that Staggs don’t know much about the
game of biff and bang. He bored in like
a white-ant, but his punches went wider
than a go-getter’s grin. As per agree-
ment, Gorilla put over a lot of fancy
stuff that don’t mean nothin', and the
crowd was delighted.
Staggs was after him all the time. He
appeared to worry Gorilla more than a
horsehair singlet. Several times he bottled
my boy up in a corner and shot in jolts
at the ribs and chin. Gorilla caught them
all on his gloves or elbows and ducked
away out of danger each time. Now and
then, to make things looks good, he wouid
stop a swing or two with the side of his
head. It sounded like a hammer on a
tub, but it didn’t hurt him. When Staggs
became too intimate, Gorilla would pump
in a jolt or two to steady him down.
It was fine. I’ve got to hand it to
Gorilla; he acted well. Now and then
I’d jab in a word or two of advice to
make it look all the better. The crowd
swallowed it up to the sinker.
Well, they carried on like that for the
first five rounds, and went through the
same kind of motions in the sixth. Then
the seventh came, and it was time for
Gorilla to take the flop. The way we
figgered was that the act should happen
in the early part of the round, so as
there would be no chance of the bell
saving my meal-ticket.
Everything went as per schedule. Not
even a fuse blew out.
When they harnessed up at the bell
Staggs, who was leading by a mile, got
to business right away. Stabbin’ a left
to Gorilla’s nose, he followed it up with
a right which missed the jaw by a
whisker. He unloosed another almost
immediate, and, looking mighty serious,
Gorilla back-pedalled out of reach. The
crowd yelled to Staggs to follow him up,
and he needed no egging on. Closing
in, he trained his port and starboard guns
on Gorilla, and was giving him heaps
of hurry-up when Gorilla made a stand
in the middle of the ring.
Toe to toe they went at it, swapping
punches for all they were worth. Sud-
denly Gorilla seemed to falter. He low-
ered his guard for the fraction of a
second, and Staggs seen his chance for
a sitting shot at the chin. Bing! He
whipped over his right, and Gorilla hit
the floor with a thud that could be heard
in Bathurst.
It was wonderful acting. All my life
I’ve been handling fighters, and I’ve never
seen anything to equal it. It was beauti-
ful. I’m figurin’ out how much we’ve
won and what we’ll spend the sugar on,
when the referee bounds over and pushes
Staggs aside.
“Stand back,” he yells. “Stand back!
You’re disqualified for hitting low!”
Well, you’ve heard the racket them
lions make at the Zoo when their keeper
turns up with the tucker. That’s only
a whisper to the din the crowd kicked
up. “Robbery!” they yells. “Barefaced
robbery! The referee’s been squared.”
The next thing I know they’re rushin’
the ring. The noise brings Gorilla to his
feet, and he whips across to me. -
By this time the ring is a panorama of
flying fists and boots. The crowd is so
anxious to get to the referee that they
don’t pay too much attention to Gorilla
and me, so as soon as we can pick an
opening we make a break for the dress-
ing-room. We slip into our togs and
drop owt of the side window and hit the
breeze for our pub. Our share of the
gate-money could wait till the morning.
There was nothing to be gained by
lingering.
About two blocks along we hear the
patter of footsteps behind us, and we’re
just about to put on an extra spurt when
the referee ranges up alongside of us.
He’s got no hat or coat, and his shirt
is half-torn off his back.
“Gripes, that was close!” he pants.
“They nearly got me once, but I gave
’em the slip and ducked out the back
way. The mob is racin’ towards the rail-
way. They think I’m making for the
station.”
“Oh, do they?” says I sarcastic.
“Well, seein’ that you ain’t in no imme-
diate danger of bein’ torn to ribbons,
maybe you’ll put us wise as to why you
disqualified Staggs?”
“Oh, that?” he says. “I thought you
tumbled. You did me a good turn oncesi
and I ain’t forgot it.”
Now, wouldn’t that jar you?
Who Goes There?
BY NOEL RAYMOND.
ANDY was Alec’s twin brother, and
they were both fine fellows. Pity
they ever left the station to take
a share in that fool mine! Oliver
found it easy enough to persuade them
with skilfully-worded promises of big
money in a hurry.
We old hands who had worked on the
station when Oliver was overseer could
not stand him. One had to allow that
he was a fine figure of a man, and effi-
cient withal, but he had a vile temper.
I remember the day he had an argu-
ment with the boss over a sheep count.
He pulled the old chap off his horse and
threw him into six feet of surging creek
floodwater. Oliver lost his job as soon
as the boss could speak.
Nothing would persuade the twins that
Oliver was more keen on easy capital
than on partners. The warning that their
savings would probably never come out
of the hole in the ground did not impress
them. Still, I think they realised that the
grim joke was “on” them before the show
actually petered out.
It was when I was at the mine one
Sunday evening that I first heard of The
Watchdog. The boys and I were yarn-
ing in the tent. Oliver was down the
creek nursing one of his fits of sulks fol-
lowing a disagreement about the next
day’s programme. He wanted things one
way; the boys wanted the opposite; and
they had. what was left of the money.
Andy was yarning, in his cheerful
manner, of things in general and the
mine in particular when he suddenly
stopped talking. He and Alec looked
toward the tent door. In a moment or
two Oliver stalked into the tent, grunted
a surly “Good-night” to me, picked up
a pipe from the table and went outside
to squat by the fire. I looked at Andy.
“That’s funny,” I remarked. “Nothing
wrong with my hearing, but I’m hanged
if I heard him coming in his ‘sneakers.’
How did you know?”
“You haven’t met our Watchdog, have
you?” laughed Alec. “He’s like the
ancestral hound you read about. And
he costs nothing to feed.”
Andy supplied further information.
“Hear that cricket chirping his head
off? Well, that’s The Watchdog. Lives
in that stump a few yards from the fire.
He’s there every night. Listen.”
He slouched lazily to his feet, ducked
at the tent door and strolled past the
stump. The cricket kept up its penetrat-
ing chirrups until Andy was abreast of
the stump. Then it stopped abruptly.
“There you are”; and Andy laughed.
“He gives us a long programme; and, as
sure as sunrise, if someone walks past
this stump when he’s in full blast he’ll
shut up like that. Must be a root or
something under the track that gives him
the office. What do you thing of Wally?”
“He’s worth his keep,” I said.
Alec suggested a hand at cards. Oliver
joined us. The vicious way he slammed
his winning cards on the table made the
hurricane-lamp dance.
As I left the camp Wally’s cheerful
little stave was momentarily stilled. J
thought idly about him afterwards.
One morning about a month later Alec
came over to the station. He found me
working on the windmill. I knew that
the boys were about to abandon their
share in the worthless mine, and that
their prospects of picking up a job at
short notice were none too bright; but J
was not prepared for the worried expres-
sion on Alec’s usually smiling counten-
ance.
“Hallo!” I called down to him. “Why
the long face? What pub does the
funeral start from? Because I’d like”-
“Hold on,” replied Alec; and I could
see there really was something wrong.
“Have you seen Andy?” he asked.
“Andy? No. Why? Has he been
over here?”
“I don’t know. I went into town
yesterday to see Rogers about that job
across the river. 1 came back this morn-
ing—and Andy’s gone.”
“Gone?” I echoed. “How do you
mean? Doesn’t Oliver?”
“Come down here,” Alec said.
I clattered down the ladder, and in a
few moments I had the strength of the
yarn. On his return Alec had naturally
asked for Andy. Oliver told him Andy
had left shortly after his brother, and
hadn’t mentioned where he was going.
“He said the only thing Andy told
him was that he had some business to
see to, and would be back in a couple
of days. I asked him. ‘What business?’
He said he'd no idea, and made some

PARENTS SHOULD KNOW THIS
HOW TO SAVE MONEY BY MAKING
FAMILY COUGH REMEDY.
It is - essential that all parents should
know how to save money by making their
own family cough remedy that will , prove
safe and effective for every member of the
family from the youngest baby up to the
oldest adult. Here is the recipe, given
by a leading chemist: Into a jug put
four tablespoonfuls of sugar, three of either
treacle or honey, two of vinegar, and a
large breakfastcupful of warm water; stir
until dissolved, and when cold, pour into
a large bottle. Then add a bottle of
concentrated HEENZO (it costs 2/- at all
leading chemists and stores), and you will
have a family supply equal in quantity and
superior in quality to eight ordinary
sized bottles of the usual remedies for
chest and throat ailments, which, if
purchased in single bottles, would cost up to
£l. You will be astounded at the speedy
way HEENZO soothes sore throats, eases
the chest, and banishes coughs, colds, croup,
bronchitis, influenza and whooping cough.
Make it a practice to always have HEENZO
in your home. — Advt.

remark about not being surprised that
Andy hadn’t explained, seeing the way
we’d been acting towards him lately
not discussing things, and so on. „
“That might have been right enough,
Alec went on, “only I was sure Andy
had had no idea of leaving camp. What
do you make of it?”
“It’s puzzling,” I said.
“Andy had what was left of our money
on him,” Alec proceeded; “we’d just
drawn it out. If there- is the slightest
possibility of Oliver, with his blasted
temper, having done anything to Andy,
F 11”.... „ T
“I’d be a bit with you, I agreed.
“Let's go over and have a look round.”
There wasn’t a sign of Oliver any-
where. A scout round the camp revealed
nothing.
I hustled back to the station to tell the
boss, while Alec rode into town. He had
a yarn to the police. There was not much
they could do, as there was no real evi-
dence of anything fishy—nothing to
prove to an outsider that Andy had not
suddenly taken it into his head to go off
on a journey. Neither was there any-
thing criminal in Oliver’s departure. He
had a right to go anywhere he wanted
without writing to the paper about it.
Until it was dark some of us from
the station rode round the district look-
ing for Andy. We did not see or hear
anything useful. Unless he had managed
a lift of some sort, he could not have
gone farther than we had ridden, as he
had not taken a horse from the camp.
The queer business had us beaten.
Andy seemed just to have walked off and
dissolved into air.
“That is, if he did walk off,” argued
Alec that night as I sat with him in the
tent. “There’s something about this that
scares me. I can’t explain it; but if you
knew what Oliver can be”....
“I know,” I told him.
Until then I had done my best to keep
Alec cheered up, but I could do it no
longer. The camp had become uncanny.
As I sat there a reminiscent picture
slowly focused on my mental eye: the
picture of Oliver, years ago, standing at
the kitchen door of the homestead and
reviling the Chinese cook. Presently he
gripped the old Chink with one massive
arm and smashed his head back against
the wall with a sickening blow under the
chin. He was “out” for hours. You
don’t manhandle a harmless old food-
spoiler unless you have the temper of a
swine.
“One more look round to-morrow,”
Alec announced, “and then I start after
Oliver. I should never have let him. go.
I’ll find him, and when I do he’ll not
get away again until he tells us a bit
more about Andy. He must know more
than he lets on.”
“I’m coming with you,” I said. ‘'Two
can handle Oliver better than one.”
“But you can’t leave your job”
Abruptly Alec ceased talking. I stared
at him as he turned towards the door
of the tent. A mysterious silence seemed
swiftly to cut us off from everything.
“Wally!” murmured Alec. “Did you
notice that? He stopped. All of a
sudden. Right in the middle of”
There was no one in sight.
' Wally started his shrill piping once
more. Alec slumped back on his bunk
again. I kept my eyes on the cigarette
I was rolling.
“Funny,” mused Alec. Even I, who
had heard his half-serious, half-amusing
description of the little insect’s habits —
“he’s the daddy of all ventriloquists,”
Alec declared —was struck by the way he
said it. He ran a hand slowly through
his thick, fair hair. I looked through
the tent door at the hazy huddle of trees
outside in the moonlight.
“Just chance,” I suggested.
“No,” decided Alec, “that wasn’t
chance. You get to know the habits of
things, even insects, when you live along-
side ’em for months. He stops often
enough at his own time; but I’ve never
heard him pull up in the middle of a
note like that unless someone was pass-
ing his stump No, it wasn’t ch”— —
He caught his breath in the middle of
the word. Wally’s song had broken
again.
“Strange,” murmured Alec. “From the
little chap’s signals it sounded just as if
someone had passed Wally, stood for a
few seconds, and then turned round and
walked back by the stump.”
I was on the point of saying some-
thing to relieve the tension, when I
glanced at Alec. The look on his face
kept me silent.
He rose and went outside the tent.
“Funny,” he repeated.
Our moving seemed to ease the strain
a little. I wandered away a short dis-
tance on the pretext of getting some
wood for the fire. Alec took a few steps
and stopped near the stump.
Then a weird thing happened. Wally
piped up again. For once the noise did
not seem to come from the stump. Sane,
everyday judgment would see nothing
unusual in this. It might not have been
the same insect.
Alec walked toward the blackbutf,
whence the chirruping now appeared to
come. He was ten yards off it when
the insect stopped, just as if someone
ahead of Alec were passing by Wally’s
new position. Almost immediately follow-
ing this the sound of his mournful little
note broke out afresh from a dark swamp
mahogany twenty yards further on.
Before Alec reached this tree the cricket’s
note died into silence as if again mark-
ing the trail of a passer-by. Shortly
afterwards the plaintive song recom-
menced from a' giant sheoak on the bank
of the creek; then it ceased altogether.
I do not know why Alec followed
that eerie vocal trail. I do not know
why I should have accompanied him.
But I did; and I stood by his side as
we looked down into the sombre swirling
depths of the creek, where it curved
under the overhanging bank.
I had never seen a man faint until
that moment; but I was not surprised
when Alec collapsed. Even to me a grey
mist mingled with the light of the moon
as I gazed into the water. We had
examined the creek before that time, but
some vagary of the current had since
moved.... Andy.
He lay dead across a deeply-submerged
log at the foot of the sheoak.
With difficulty I pulled the body from
the water. In the middle of his chest
was the hole made by a rifle bullet.
We acted only upon circumstantial
evidence when we set out to get Oliver;
but our suspicions were later justified,
although his judgment never rested in
our hands. The police got him before
we did. They had found the bullet, which
was from Oliver’s rifle —it was of unusual
calibre, and he was carrying it when they
arrested him—and he confessed.
Oliver had heard we were after him, I
believe; and someone had told him about
the cricket yarn. He had always struck
me as peculiar in his manner, but he
must have been even more unbalanced
than we realised, because the next time
Alec and I saw him he was in a mental
asylum.
“A queer case,” explained the doctor
to me. “That yarn he heard about the
cricket leading you to the body appears
to have possessed his mind. Got crickets
on the brain. Seems always keen to
imitate one. Chirrups away like any-
thing and breaks off in the middle of a
note. Poor devil... .it’s strange.”
“H’m” I said. “I suppose so.”
“Eh?” ,
“Eh? Oh, yes,” I added, “of course
... .poor chap.”
But I was thinking of Alec.
“Yes... .it’s very strange.”
And then I was referring to Wally.
What’s In a Name?
What’s in a name,
That it should have such power to draw
The bow across the quivering strings
Of memory, whence came —
Obeying some mysterious law —
Sounds sweet and low,
Insistent as the beat of myriad wings,
Old melodies, forgotten long ago?
What’s, in a name,
That it should stir the blood of men
And rouse them like a trumpet blast
To glorious deeds, whose fame
Shall so inspire the poet’s pen *
That his own song
Shall, like a granite monument, outlast
The thing that it had honored for so long?
What’s in a name
That i; should bring the outer tear,
The "smile, the heartache, the warm glow
Of pride, the chill of shame:
That one should be of all most dear
And set apart
As in a shrine, that only I may know
And whisper in the darkness of my heart?
S.A.
H. L. WARD.
You Did Not Love.
You did not love me, dear, or so you said.
And then all passionate you bent my head
And pressed hot kisses there that burnt and
tore.
And yet you did not love me, so you swore!
You did not love me —oh, my dear, and so
You kissed my hands, and gently bade me go,
Before we twain forgot the vows we made.
You did not love, and yet you were afraid!
You did not love, but deep down in your eyes
I glimpsed the light that shines through
Paradise,
That I may not forget till Life be fled,
Although you did not love me —so you said!
You did not love me, dear, and yet your heart
Beat faster when the moment came to part,.
And as I felt your pulse throb ’neath mine own
I thanked the gods that we had met —and
known!
You did not love —ah, no. And yet—and yet—
I wonder will you ever quite forget!

pupils. This pupil has also had a novel
accepted by Heinemann, of London.
Other Pupils Write:—*
“My London agent expects to publish

asked for the rest of the series to
which one belongs.”
“My story ‘Nemesis’ was published.
Without your most helpful guidance
I would never have got anywhere.”
“I have had my fourth story accepted.
This is not bad, seeing that I am
not yet out of my ‘teens.’ ”
“You will be pleased to learn that I
have sold my story ‘Escape’ to ——.
The first intimation I had was the
receipt of a cheque for six guineas by
this morning’s mail and advice that it
was in the July (1933) issue.”

The OPINIONS OF THOSE WHO PRACTISE
PELMANISM
ARE ITS STRONGEST RECOMMENDATION
AUSTRALIAN AND NEW ZEALAND OPINIONS.
A CABINET MAKER: “The chief
benefit I have received is that of know-
ing myself and my limitations. I have
strengthened my confidence, and been
assisted in overcoming a shy and re-
served nature. I realise that every day
I am showing some improvement.”
ENGINEER: “I feel physically and
mentally alive and ready for my day’s
work. I can find interest in it now,
when I was beginning to think I had
made a mistake.”
ASSESSOR: “Considerable progress in
my conversational efforts, which are now
a pleasure and relaxation, instead of an
embarrassment.”
DOCTOR: “Whilst visiting many large
centres and interviewing numbers of
business and professional men I have
found repeatedly coming to my aid the
benefits of the Pelman Course.”
CLERK: “Keener interest in life and
improved greatly in Self-confidence, Per-
sonality and Memory. Conducting my
social life confidently and more effici-
ently.”
FARMER: “I took up the Course with
main object of overcoming a reserved
nature, which precluded me from taking
part in discussions of policy and in de-
bates. I have achieved this object. Also,
I find myself rapidly acquiring a larger
circle of friends.”
FARMER: “The Lesson on Personality
is splendid; all fears are gone, and I
now enjoy my social life.”
CLERK: “Last month I won a Flying
Scholarship for which 'there were 216
entrants. I thank Pelmanism for this
success, chiefly because of the wonder-
ful manner in which it has increased
my self-confidence.”
CYCLE ASSEMBLER: “I have some-
thing to show for the Pelman Training.
I have just won the State 25-mile Pro-
fessional Cycling Championship. The
Course, by increasing my confidence,
certainly helped me to gain this title.
SHEEP FARMER: “My main object
(the desire to overcome the impediment
in my speech) in taking up the Course
has been attained.”
ENGINEER: “I am amazed at the
manner in which these printed Lessons
time and again hit upon, and deal with,
what I have always considered as my
own personal and particular problems.”
HORTICULTURIST: “Thanks to Pel-
manism, I have instituted a system into
the harvesting which worked out without
a hitch, and have taken off a record crop
with less expense per. ton, and in a
shorter time than ever 1 have before.”
COMMERCIAL TRAVELLER: “It
may interest you to know that my
figures for the first quarter this year
show an increase of 30 per cent.”
CLERGYMAN. “I am conscious of
much greater freedom in preaching—
also of fertility of ideas. Last Sunday
1 preached four times to different con-
gregations on practically the same sub-
ject with scarcely any repetition.”
A MEMBER OF LEGISLATIVE
COUNCIL: “There was a fear in my
mind that I was drifting, and was get-
ting past the time when I could settle
down and study without positively driv-
ing myself, and that feeling has been
dispelled.”
A JUDGE: “I have derived great bene-
fit from the Course, and from the careful
correction of my work. The lessons
should be studied again and again for
the purpose of training, so that when a
great effort is required a man may be
able to use all the powers of his mind
without thinking of rules.”
A TEACHER : “The other night I was
suddenly called upon to speak at a meet-
ing. I found that I did the job much
better than I expected, and with very
little self-consciousness. That is the
result of the Exercises, in that I am
thinking more- of what I have to say
than of myself.”
A MECHANIC: “Now that the Course
is finished I must tell you that I am
more than satisfied with it. I am vastly
improved as far as my work is con-
cerned, mainly because I am taking an
interest in it.”
A STENOGRAPHER: “The whole
Course is such a sane, well-balanced
training that one cannot fail to respect
and appreciate it.”
The results of the Pelman Training are seen in the Pelmanist’s every
activity. In his calling, in his social life, in all his interests Pelmanism
increases his force as an individual, makes him stronger in purpose, more
direct in thought, sounder in judgment, quicker in decision and more
confident and successful in action.

The Late
Mr. Edgar Wallace,
“I liave found Pel-
manism,” the late
Mr. Edgar Wallace
wrote, “the most
useful method for
the organisation of

ability to concen-
trate is not only
assisted, but created
by the Pelman
Method. Pelmanism
is the machine-tool
of thought.”

admirable system of

man has the key to
his own career and
enables many to
find the key itself
which, for want of
self-knowledge, had
lain undiscovered.”

Sir Herbert Barker:
“I know of no other
method to compare
with Pelmanism. I
am convinced that
benefit beyond com-
putation ca. n b e
secured by all—
whether the student
be nineteen or ninety
—who will follow
the directions given
in the Course.”
