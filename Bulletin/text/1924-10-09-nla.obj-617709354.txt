Variations on a Theme
Theme:
Old Mother Hubbard went to the cupboard
To geb her poor dog a bone.
But when she got there the cupboard was bare,
And so the poor dog had none.”
Neil Lyons :
Ostensibly to replenish my stock of to-
bacco, but in reality to see what could be
seen, I was strolling along High-street when
I encountered my friend Mrs. Hubbard.
Mrs. Hubbard is a bony old lafiy with a
flapping bonnet and a face like a wrinkled
tomato, the coloring engendered by years of
imbibing gin and stout. Quite a chatty old
lady, with one tooth standing prominently
in the centre of her mouth, a sort of gastro-
nomic finger-post, for food. When Mrs' Hub-
bard isn’t chatting, she chars. Usually she
does both.
In her hand she carried a piece of string,
and at the end of the string was a sort .of
a dog, a nasty sort of a dog,_with a wall-eye
and a wolfish leer.
“Good morning, Mrs. Hubbard,” remarked
your servant, brightly. “Taking him for a
run?”
Mrs. Hubbard did things to her tooth.
“ ’R, ’ini,” quoth she, when her dental
toilet was completed. “Now, y.a’d think,
young fella, be the look of ’ini, that he’d be
sorter company for me, a sorter companion,
as ya might say. Ser nice and friendly
like, ser cheerful. But, Lor’ bless ya, ’e
only lives to eat, as the sayin’ is. Give ’im
a bit o’ fish, or a ’unk o’ steak, or the like,
and he’s ’app.v. No friendship for me noble
when he’s full’p.”
“He seems to have a healthy metabolism,”
I remarked helpfully.
Mrs. Hubbard gazed at the hound suspi-
ciously. “And why shouldn’t he ’ave?” she
said, with some heat. “Seein’ as ’ow he’s
pidigreed!”
“But as I was tellin’ ya,” she continued,
reverting to her original theme, “I says to
’Ubbard this mornin’, I says, ‘when ya go
t’ work t’-day don’t take the blinkin’ sajd
with ya. Cut ya lunch by all means, but
leave somethin’ for others. Live and let
live,’ I says. And after he’d gorn I came
over all faint like,' and felt as ’ow a little
of somethin’ might spruce me up a bit, as
the sayin’ is. So I goes inter the kitchen—
follied be the dog, for share and share alike
is my motter—and without arskin by ya
leave of nobody, I opings the larder door,
and, believe me or believe me not, young
fella, but much less any vittals for ’is lorful
wife, ’Ubbard ’adn’t even left a (vital-fluidy)
bone for the dog!”
11. L. Mencken :
Madame Hubbard was a female Babbitt,
afflicted with the Pollyanna complex.
Her credo embraced the writings of
Jehovah, Rotary whim-wham, the mouthings
of the (late) Hon. Gamaliel Harding and
the plays of M. Belasco.
In brief, one of the booberie.
Ergo: It followed as night' the day that
the old gal likewise cherished a partiality
for Infant Damnation, Comstockery, Coon
Baiting (as practised in Roseburg, Ya.),
Nordic Blondes and the Nobility of Animals
—including Man.
“Have Bull-Terriers a Beyond?” was her
favorite opus at Chautauqua burblings. And,
if my spies be given credence, she was also
the Mother Superior of a menagerie of mon-
grels, parked in old-man Hubbard’s cyclone
cellar, between the home-brew and the cage
where he kept his synthetic gin.
# Came a day when her favorite hound lay
sick a-bed, and the Madame Hubbard fussed
around him like a vice-crusader snouting
about the precincts of a bagnio. What to
do? How euchre the mortician? Ah, an
idea! Did not Ponto refuse all ordinary
fodder? He must then be tempted with a
different pabulum! Ponto must keep up his
strength with pumpernickel.
Therefore to the larder, prestissimo!
But the larder, was as innocent of pumper-
nickel as the cerebrum of a Klan corpsbruder
is of sense. After bellowing to the Almighty,
the good Madame’s subsequent charge to the
corner delicatessen resembled Paul Revere’s
ride, with syncopated band parts by Irvine
Berlin.
At long last the hound was saved alive.
And, lo! It came to pass that the
pumpernickel was as bread cast upon the
waters, for when next the sap rose i’ th’
trees, as yeast in near-beer, the Maison
Hubbard made much wampum by the barter-
ing of the fruits of Ponto’s fecundity, at five
bucks per pup, or- three for ten.
O. Henby:
Bagdad-on-the-lludson has its tragedies:
spiritual, mental, cardiac and stomachic.
Although the geographical distance be-
tween Gramerey Square and Avenue A is
infinitesimal, yet the social and dietetic gulf
which separates them is as wide as the world.
But many an Avenue A-lien sighs for Rhine
wine and truffles who must needs be content
with Pilsener and pretzels. And many a
Gramerey Squarehead, feasting off Tokay
and terrapin, would gladly slough the leg-
irons of Convention to partake of chop-suey
and weinerwurst.
But the Ring Master of the Cosmic circus
cracks his whip, and, perforce, caliph and
slave jump through' the hoops of Circum-
stance at his behest, and take what he deigns
to give them. This is the story of an excep-
tion.
Fido was the pampered pet of the rich old
Mrs. Stuyvesant-llubbard. Although a
champion pug, Fido never had. to fight. His
motto was “Passive Acceptance.”
Every morning he was bathed by Phry-
nette in warmed and perfumed water; every
noon and evening Jenks, the butler, would
heap his silver platter with the choicest mor-
sels ; and every night he slept the sodden
sleep of opulence on his mistress’s silken
coverlet.
But came a time when his Dogship wooed
Morpheus in vain, and he tossed and whined
and fretted, until he awoke his mistress.
“Was Fido-widikins hungry then?” cooed
she. “Mumma get booful doggie some food.”
Although a good mathematician. Mrs. Hub-
bard was a poor diagnostician, but she lifted
the starving animal from his rug, assisted
him down to the kitchen, and plopped him
into a ring-side seat.
The white-tiled cupboard door swung slowly
back... .but the interior, except for a planked
steak, some lobster Newburg, prawns-in-
aspic and the remains of a creamed chicken
was absolutely bare!
The female delegate of the S.P.C.A. heaped
some lobster on an entree dish, artistically
garnished the steak and chicken with an
hors-d’oeuvre of prawns, and placed the feast
before the puling pug.
With a wolfish howl the famished dog
sprang at the—No! You are all wrong!
For Fido, hungry little Fido-widikins, merely
looked at the food and shuddered. His stom-
ach revolted at the thought of prawns; his
canine soul was sick of chicken ; steak to him
was an abomination. For many a gourmet,
surfeited with Tokay and terrapin, sighs for
chop-suey and weinerwurst, and all Fido
craved was a bone.
11. G. Wells:
Mrs. Bert Hubbard was fat and forty,
with a trinity of jolly little chins tumbling
over her countenance like chubby, pink-and-
white cherubs.
Her day’s work over, she had visions of cold
beef, with a liberal helping of mustard, and
perhaps a foaming jug of home-brew, and a
bone for the dog.
Blithely she went to the cupboard, and
with anticipatory precipitation she opened
the d00r....
You figure her, standing silent and a little
tremulous before the hungry dog. (Quite
a jolly little dog, with merry brown eyes
and a friendly bark. A dog in the hinter-
linul of whose mind flamed'the magic word
“Food.”) But like most things in this queer
old, muddled old stew called Life, the cup-
board was an empty illusion. True, its walls
and its top and its back were solid enough,
but the inside was as bare as an egg....
Hum this, very Bum indeed!
One hesitates to pen the mournful fact
that the old lady and her dog were the
helpless victims of Cause and Effect. One’s
study of biology and sociology helps here.. ..
helps enormously. But the deepest truths
of philosophy could not alter the concrete
facts that Might is Right, that Possession
is Nine Points of a muddleheaded Law, and
that Bert Hubbard had got to the provender
first.. . .
Joseph Hergesiieimer :
The day, like a dying nun, merged almost
imperceptibly into the dusk. Westward a
transient flame marked Its funeral pyre, and
the autumnal trees, like burnished brasses,
burned in the last gold of the sunlight.
With dragging feet Verity Hubbard slowly
crossed the room. The hound followed at her
heels, jowls slavering, eyes greedy, savage
with anticipation.
The flowers of her crinoline, patterned in
crimson peonies, swayed in the shadows like
sentient things. Verity stretched forth a
thin hand, a hand wax-like in its fragility,
and fumbled with’ the massive cedar door.
Nothing. She felt that this would be so,
must be so, even before her peering eyes re-
gistered the fact.
Then she remembered, remembrance that
was poignant with sadness, old Fordyce Hub-
bard’s counsel. His slow periods, packed
with the garrulous wisdom of the aged, came
back to her across the years.
“Look to To-morrow Look to To-mor-
row,” had been its burden. To-morrow! If
she had but treated To-day as a To-morrow,
then the cupboard would not now. have been
empty—empty and barren, bare as her life
was bare.
With shaking limbs she quavered to a seat.
Sat motionless with resigned hands folded in
her flowering lap. Outside the soft fingers
of the dusk, inevitable, insistent, moved
across the face of the world, smudged and
blurred the silhouetted trees. The crimson
leaves fluttered down from the larches, eddy-
ing to earth, and the speaking silence was
disturbed, shattered, by the howling of a
dog.
G. F. E.
The Young Maeterlinck
Nowadays he takes his rest in a rose-
hidde,n villa on the Riviera, apparently
silent; and the other month a young writer
in the Mekcure referred to him in passing
somewhat despectuously. It grieves those
who once were his admirers and still prize
some part of his work.
Thirty-five years ago he was a young bar-
rister, without practice or the need for it,
quietly busy with literature and mysticism
in Ghent, liis relaxation being to take long
skating trips on the frozen canals, up into
Holland and back in a winter’s day. There
it was that fame, or,. rather, publicity, came
to him. To be acclaimed by an enthusiastic
Parisian journalist as equal at least to
Shakspeare must be, for a young provincial
writer, more disconcerting than welcome.
The word spread; Maeterlinck gained
notoriety; his two earliest plays had ap-
peared in English by 1-892, and Mr. Gosse,
who for years walked the rope as delicately
as any cat with regard to foreign literatures
called them “Ollendorffian attitudinizings.”
Nevertheless, Maeterlinck allowed himself
to be distracted from his path neither by
praise nor by blame. If one prefers his
earlier work up to 1897 one must do him
the credit of the fair conclusion that he
only abandoned his youthful vein when it
ivas exhausted.
Seldom does one see notice taken now of
Maeterlinck’s first book, a book of verse
with the title “Serres chaudes” (Hothouses)
The title is promptly explained in the first
poem, and the tenor of the book by an epi-
graph from the “Imitation”: “And to him
that is torpid there is left much wretched-
ness.” It is the mystic torpor of the soul
displayed in images bizarre and disconcert-
ing at first sight, but neither unnatural nor
grotesque. In that languid air of impotence
and inaction, thoughts and desires and
dreams, all the contraries, expand in

DAVID JONES’
FOR SERVICE-QPP. G.P-O. SYDNEY
terrifyingly quiet neighborhood, like 11.
vegetation of some monstrous hothouse
—when shall we have the wind and <
rain and snow? The metrical form <
was certainly perplexing, in that, wniu.
the majority of the poems were in simp ;
eight-syllable quatrains, every now and then
there intervened a piece in Whitmamc mea-
sures. However, one was reassured on
observing that in these latter each line pre-
sented a separate image, and the general im-
pression was one of the confused jostle _ ot
the serve, whereas the poems in quatrains *
each developed a single image, and had a
murmur as of prayer. It was the difference
between the soul distractedly contemplating
its own disarray and the soul half-silently
aspiring. If I dwell on this little book, it
is because the first impression dwells m me
over such a space of years. There were the
criticisms of that forgotten time. ‘Do you
want everybody to write like that? V\ hy,
.certainly not; and it would be unjust and
foolish to expect Maeterlinck to write always
like that. But the book was to be done
once; and there it is.
The early dramas are all made out ot
the same or very kindred moods—the loneli-
ness of the soul, its helplessness, its silences.
That the rendering of these did not go with-
out something mechanical has often been laid
to their charge, but unfairly. Once you take
the book out of the reader’s hands and put
another medium between him and it, you
are well on the way to sensationalism and
melodrama. And why should not drama be
melodramatic?
The earliest of these dramas are spoilt,
by the introduction of sheer terror; the first
—“Princess Maleine” —is too long drawn out.
Of those which employ as a mecliancial
stage-property the glass wall of the serves
ohaudes, my favorite is one which seems
never to have been reprinted, a reason for
dwelling on it here. The foreground shows
us the interior of that house where, until
the end of the play, sleep the “Seven Prin-
cesses,” after whom it is named. Through
the glass wall at the back are to be seen a
terrace and a great canal stretching to the
horizon. From the canal come adventurers’
cries: “Atlantic! Atlantic! We return no
more.” The old king and queen come to the
terrace to peep at the seven sleepers ; from
them we learn that, ever since the young
prince sailed off to seek adventure and glory,
the princesses have pined, and at last fallen
into apathetic lethargy. At iast the great
ship is seen coming down the canal, and the
cry goes up that the prince is back. The
princesses awake —all but one, the young-
est, whose attitude in sleep has, throughout
the play, been so sinister. Here we have not
merely a compelling situation and a most
fascinating picture in action but the best
example perhaps of that symbolic drama
which was so zealously sought after 30 years
ago. A little while he controlled this
precarious form; then he declined on bor-
rowed subjects and the intolerable blank
hexameter; with “Monna Vanna” he has
already become a dramatist like any one of
the many.
His mystical studies bore their finest in
the first of his prose-books, “The Treasure
of the Humble.” What the book says is
true —true because of the author’s sincerity ;
true, above all, artistically. For since in
this region all is still mystery, we must not
let ourselves be browbeaten by any would-be
usurpers of vacant chairs, no matter what
their “profession.” The prose, differing
from that of the dramas in that it is continu-
ous, has the same incantatory quality as the
verse of “Serres chaudes” ; and so, harmoni-
ously along with “Aglavaine,” closes the
period which that began. It was not to be
asked of Maeterlinck that he should for ever
dwell in that rare region—that he should
spoil, by repetition, that murmuring music.
Only when the change came, why did our
Maeterlinck become so much like the every-
body of everybody else? It is not the later
dramas I have so much in view, though there
he seems to me to fall into place between
the grotesqueies of the ageing Ibsen and the
strained vacuities of Gerhart Hauptmann.
It is that flood of articles! I do not com-
plain that he wrote and published them ; every
man has a right to his own way of making a
living. The grievance is that he regularly
collected them in volume-form, with mysteri-
ous titles, as if each of them were another
“Treasure of the Humble.” Your author
turned journalist came near to joining that
abomination, the “intelligentsia.”
I have been trying to recapture and
characterise an old delight, to bring back a
Maeterlinck whom none can know but those
who grew up with him. Perhaps in vain.
The swans of Bruges are driven off the
canals by the motor-launch ; where once only
the carillon broke the silence, the air is mad-
dened with the honk of the horn and the
screech of the siren. And Maurice Maeter-
linck no longer skates the frozen canals from
Ghent into Holland and back all in a win-
ter’s day.
CHRIS. BRENNAN.
Political Potter’s Clay
Nearly two centuries ago, in a Stafford-
shire town, was born a potter, the son of a
potter. With little or no education,’ Josiah
Wedgwood by virtue of some aesthetic quality
raised the rude process of the potter to the
plane of a fine art. If he knew little Latin
and no Greek he had the Attic soul; and in
his time no man did more to promote appreci-
ation of the grace, beauty and strength of
line in classic sculpture. Fortunate to-day is
the man who possesses specimens of the
original Wedgwood ware—the wdiite cameo-
reliefs by Flaxman on a pure blue ground.
The original Josiah was the typically “self-
made man” of his time, an appreciable figure
in the societies and associations devoted to
thought and culture. Rising, by dint of
sheer natural ascendancy, from the ranks of
labor, he became a capitalist, lavishing
wealth on this side and that with princely
profusion. That was the old Josiah. The
new Josiah is a member of the Macdonald
Ministry, an avowed socialist and single-
taxer. (Essays and Adventures of a Labor
M.P., by Col. the Rt. Hon. Josiah C. Wedg-
wood, D. 5.0., M.P., Chancellor of the Duchy
of Lancaster: Allen and Unwin.)
The author describes his book as “a sand-
wich,” in which adventure and experience
in South Africa, India, Asia Minor, Russia
and elsewhere "play bread and mustard to
the political meat.” It is the political meat
that is of inteerst, apart from, or perhaps
by reason of, the paradox that the Josian
of old, the simple potter at his wheel, dreamt
of capital, and achieved it, while the. capi-
talist Josiali of to-day dreams of Socialism,
and seeks to break the dead man's idol. To be
a socialist is, of course, to argue a social
revolution, and Col. Wedgwood is unwary
enough to say how he proposes to bring it
about. He has alternative schemes, cer-
tainly, so that if you do not approve the
one you may take the other. The first is the
Co-operative Commonwealth, which has this
in common with our present capitalistic
society, that the co-operation is compulsory:
It is the co-operation of galley slaves, chained to
the same bench and toiling at the same oar to further
the progress of the ship of State.... and a most com-
munal death by drowning when the ship goes down.
The transition to this Co-operative Commonwealth
would be most certainly effected by continuing—only
more logically and energetically—along the lines we
have begun.
From which we infer that the Colonel is not
altogether in love with this first scheme,
the Bolshevistic dream. For him there is
a better way :—
There is another Co-operative Commonwealth of
quite another kind. It is not a “ship’ nor an organ-
ism,” nor any other allegorical symbol, but an associa-
tion of free individuals, voluntarily associated for
mutual aid and co-operating for common ends ; who,
just because they are free, can yield without suspicion
and fear to the natural social instincts. They share,
each alike, and the produce is the property of the pro-
ducers.
To realise this “dream” (for the author
admits that at present it may be no more,
though it need not so remain) “requires no
elaboration of Government machinery, nor
carefully restrictive measures, but the simple
abolition of privileges and monopolies —from
the monopoly of land and privileges of capi-
tal, to the privileges of majorities.” The
means offered to effect this end are, indirectly,
“a moral education” of the mass of the
people, and, directly, the use of the exist-
ing Government machinery to attack these
privileges. “Monopoly in land” is the giant
that stands in the gallant Colonels road to
Utopia. It is, he says, the root of a whole
tangle of false social conceptions, the. base
on which Capitalism rears itself, and is the
cause of the more notorious social evils such
as unemployment, low wages, disease, prosti-
tution and others. “Freedom,” lie declares,
“is the indispensable condition of. successful
co-operation ; without it co-operation is only
a fine name for bondage.” To secure a re-
turn of the land to the State he sees two pos-
sible courses that may be taken. One is
“direct action” : that is the forcible seizure
of the land by the workers. The other is
the slow torture and ultimate extinction of
the present landowner by “the governmental
method of the taxation of land values.”
In the first case the workers will seize the land they
work on, agreeing to pay the rest of the community
for any special natural advantages of the site they have
taken; while vacant land will be open to occupation
by anyone who may want to use it. In the second
case, a full tax ' (or rate) on the unimproved
site value of lands will induce the present landlord
to put his share to full use or loose his grip, destroy-
ing both the monopoly and the monopoly price of
land, and reducing the landlord from a rent receiver
to a worker. At the same time, land of insignificant
site value, not actually cultivated, will be open to
anyone for use, with security for all improvements
and for tenancy during use.
Personally, the author favors the latter
course, because “it seems more practicable,
and also because there is with it less danger,
perhaps, of the tyranny that inevitably
accompanies force and direct-action.' Tin*
landowner is to be boiled ; but the Colonel
is willing that it should be done over a slow
fire. So will end the Capitalist: “his strength
lies in the land-monopoly, for that alone en-
ables him to buy landless men. Abolish that
and you have a shorn Samson to reckon
with.”
It seemed much like that to William Lane,
too. And then William Lane went to Para-
guay with some of the finest men and women
Australia ever owned, and discovered that
private land-ownership is not the only thing
that stands between the sons of the Earth
and Utopia.

Lydia O’Neil
Dinkum Aussie and Other Poems, by
Lydia M. D. O’Neil, is patchy, but some of
it has charm. “Dinkum Aussie” is by no
means the best, but it represents a sincere
attempt to do justice to men who are, appa-
rently, not the author’s compatriots by birth.
The lady obtrudes unobtrusively, so to
speak: though her work has been widely
accepted in the United States and Canada,
what has been published in this country has
not hitherto been known as it should be.
At present she lives at Wynnum, near Bris-
bane, and in the little ’tween-whiles that a
full life of business allows, her pen runs
to verse. And some of it is surprisingly
good—flesh-and-blood stuff that climbs to a
plane distinctly above the love-sick ricochet-
ings of most of the contributors to society
magazines. The first of her work that came
under my notice —it think it was the first of
it ever printed in the Brisbane Daily Mail
—was a short set of verses. It was some-
thing about camels, and instantly the tang
of the desert was back in my nostrils, and
into my vision floated Wali Dad and the
scene outside Peshawar where
Tribesmen bellowed to hasten the food,
And the campfires twinkled by Fort Jumrood.
Through her muse runs the wanderlust that
has given us much that is good in our poetry,
and its leaven spreads through these verses
under review. Whether she sings of the Port
of Spain, Moreton Bay, the Northland that
she seems to love so well. Ning-po-fu or the
Bokharan deserts, she sings with a lute
attuned to a mind that runs, fancy-free and
unfettered, on the seven seas and in the un-
spoiled places to landward.
What is it like at the Top of the World?
Tell me, Kai!
switches the reader on to a descriptive
bit of story-making by this son of vikings—
this Kai from the Northland—that is -worthy
of comparison with the best that Australia
has done in this class of waiting. Equally
good is the scene in “Boxing the Compass”
where, still wedded to her Nordic inspiration,
she tells of Sven, the Swedish quartermaster,
sailing down miles of latitude, and teaching
as he goes the first principles of navigation
to some fair young thing captivated by his
vital force and the precision of his crafts-
manship : —•
“West-nor’-west, nor’-west bj r west, nor’-west, nor’-
west. by nor’ —”
Where’s the Scottish skipper now —where’s the bo’s’n
gone ?
And Sven, the Swedish sailorman, all the world to
me?
Out beyond the sunset I am sure they’re sailing on —
Sailing on forever on a wide supernal sea.
Filmy clouds for tarry ropes, shafts of light for
spars—
Sven, let down the gang-plank. I am weary of the
shore.
Sven! I hear you calling yet, out beyond the stars!
“Nor’-west! Nor’-west by nor’!”
Both beauty and vigor are to be found in
this little collection. The dross is more than
outweighed by the adroit expression of a
spirit that gives full-length portraits to its
creatures —to Kai and to Sven; and to her
descriptive work she brings a mind pro-
foundly stirred by association with the
places she has visited or read about.

A Satchel of Books
Mr. Rowl, by D. K. Broster (Heinemann). The
story of a young French officer on parole in England
during the Napoleonic upheavals. Of course he falls
in love with the beauteous English heroine, Juliana,
who for reasons of the story is engaged to another.
Juliana’s betrothed grows jealous and brews a pot
of trouble. Blit Mr. Broster is master of the situa-
tion and produces a wedding-ring and a happy ending.
The Wonders of Salvage, by David Masters (John
Lane). A story of the men who cheat the sea of
its prey. The author traces the development of
marine salvage from the crude efforts of the earliest
treasure-seekers down to the highly developed organi-
sations that are in existence to-day. He gives
interesting accounts of all the notable “sates” of
recent years, and incidentally pays a well-earned
tribute to tho British Naval Salvage Section, whose
work during the war took a lot of the sting out of
the Hun submarine campaign.
Unity, by J. D. Beresford (Collins). Unequal to
Beresford at his best, this novel is yet worth while,
for the author, even at his worst, takes pains with
his writing. As a title “Unity” suggests things
it doesn't fulfil—forces, problems, lessons on the
grand scale. Unity is merely a girl’s name, which
as appropriately might have been May or June.
To be sure, it lias supposedly a mystical connotation,
but the story fails on this motif. And it is too
absurd. Having looked into his eyes once, for 10
years they haunt Unity uncannily and state her
through two marriages, at the last shoving her
husband into suicide for his great and beautiful
love of her, so that the owner of the eyes shall
presumably put hypnotic arms about her also. The
premonitions, second sight and veiled esotericism
spoil a really fine study of a woman. Of success
on the stage —attained in Sydney as a modern Rosa-
lind —the book is a captivating portrait,
Ilarbottle, by John Hargrave (Duckworth). With
this notable book its author leaps toward the
front. In style and. subject-matter it is reminiscent
of H. G. Wells when splendidly serious. It is another
story of a man’s quest for the ideal city and
civilisation —a “Pilgrim’s Progress” of our times
with men and women of flesh and blood; and the
incidents, episodes and mental storms can be seen
occurring. The hero gives two sons to the Great War
and returns himself from it to meet still _ another
blow —the desertion of his wife. These vivid pages
hurt. To obtain some sort of distraction he starts
tramping the roads. But he is seeking something
too; so he talks with the propagandists, and bril-
liantly done dialogues stud the story. Each yarn
is natural and quotable, a by no means meagre
achievement. Religionists, New Thoughtist.s, health
evangelists, spiritualists, socialists, scientists, painters,
lovers, the idle rich, the idle poor—these and
cranks of every sort and condition take part in the
arrestive argumentation and pass on. All that Har-
bottle gets from it is the voiceless grave. But the
book “gives one furiously to think.”
Social Credit, by Major O. H. Douglas (Cecil
Palmer). This is a thoughtful contribution to the
solution of the economic difficulties supervening on the
Great War. The author indicates what, in his opinion,
are the principles “essential in dealing not only with
the concrete problems, but the perverted psychology
which in combination threaten civilisation.” In
his view the present system of society depends for
its structure on the theory of material rewards and
punishments, and such a system gives a certain small
number of individuals enormous, if frequently hidden,
power. The control of money is by far the greatest
power wielded by this small minority. “Taking the
situation as a whole,” he says, “it seems indisputable
that sooner or later this monopoly of money power has
to be attacked.” Taxation 'does not attack, but
“enormously strengthens and consolidates it,” and the
only means by which the principle that “right is
might” can be secured is by obtaining the control
of the money inducements which ensure mass action.
The first aim of economic freedom should be, he
thinks, to secure the distribution of money power,
in opposition to the present tendency to concentrate
it in group organisations. As to ways and means,
the author lias nothing better to offer than a nebulous
process of “constructive revolution.”
The Inner Discipline, by Charles Baudouin and-
A. Lestchinsky (Allen and Unwin). A few years ago
H. G. Wells got tired of the old gods and fixed! up
a pantheon of his own, consisting of the Almighty
plus an “Invisible King” who was a sort of inter-
mediary between man arid his Maker. Wells has for-
gotten about his deity in the excitement of running
up weatherboard Utopias, but if he had taken the
trouble to track him to his lair he would have
probably reached the same conclusion about him as the
authors of “The Inner Discipline.” The immediate over-
seer of the human animal’s moral activities, according to
them, is man’s unruly tenant, the sub-conscious
mind; and the meditations of the Buddhists, the
asceticisms of the .Stoics and the ecstasies of the
Christian scientists have had for their aim the
same object, the propitiation of this arbitrary deity,
who can turn brave soldiers into runaways and
innocent girls into sadists. The psyclio-analyists are
the high priests of the temple and can interpret the
sayings of the god, who becomes loquacious in our
dreams and betrays himself. Auto-suggestion forces
his favor, and by its means the sexual instinct,
repressed in youth and finding expression later in
horrible perversions, can be sublimated into a love
of art or science, the combative instinct can be
transmuted into a desire to climb mountains or
play chess and the power instinct into a passion for
alms-giving. The history and possibilities of the
cult are simply and interestingly portrayed.

A note from Will Lawson: Eucalyptus-trees from
Australia thrive in California. Many Californians be-
lieve that the trees belong to their country; but one
of them, Harry Pratt, poet-editor of the Overland
Monthly, doesn’t. Here is a poem written by him
about Australia’s tree: —
I love these trees which hesitant stand,
Afraid to enter on a. land
Which is not theirs, however kind —
These alien trees which never find
Kinship among the trees which grow
Where golden poppies, flaming, flow ;
But stand aloof, their ragged cloaks
Slight covering, while valley oaks
Flaunt velvet green above the field,
Their arrogance but half-concealed.
I hold it is a princely tree
Which still may stand in dignity.
When the red-gums sigh and sway in the sea winds
on the Berkeley hills, they are just like that, silent
and dignified, with only the blue jays to chatter in
their branches.

A Burroughs Will Keep
You Better Posted
SL
Each account in your ledger carries a
proved balance every day when your books
are kept on a Burroughs Automatic Book-
keeping Machine.
This machine keeps you better posted in
three important ways. It does the posting
in less time. It keeps your work up-to-date
without overtime or night work. It pro-
vides information and a knowledge of how
much is due you —not once a month, but every day.
What a contrast to old-fashioned pen-and-ink methods! Every
time you refer to an account for credit information, you must
resort to hurried pencil figuring which frequently is inaccurate.
Moreover to keep such records up-to-date often calls for overtime
or night work. It’s real economy to post ledgers with a Burroughs.
Have a conference with the Burroughs man today. Phone the
nearest Burroughs representative, or mail the coupon. Taert, is
not the slightest obligation and the savings which may result from
such a conference may mean hundreds of pounds to you.

One Way of Love.
VARIOUS VERSE
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Oh. the slim ladies in their cloth of gold.
And the red rose, the languor and the smile,
The opening flower of a lover’s kiss.
The singing, springing ecstasy of hiiss—
These things are not grown old!
Oh, the light laughter and the lighter tears.
The masks and melody and one brown hand
That held a sword-hilt glowing like the stars,
Or eyes grown bright with love through lat-
tice bars —
Those were the golden years!
Oh, the gay coming and the gay farewell,
The soothing satin and caressing silk.
The rondeau and the peacocks on the lawn,
The clinging arms that loosened with the
dawn—
The tender road to Hell!
Oh, the last coming as the slow stars gleam,
The- moon asliine on gold and porphyry!
The crystal vases splinter as they fall;
My lady has her cloth-of-gold for pall—
My lord an easy dream!

The Poplars. .
Nine grey ghosts arc out on the hill.
Wraiths of the amber flames that glowed
When autumn travelled the windy road,
There in the dusk-light, pallid and chill,
The poplars stand on the barren hill.
I have known them when Spring went by,
Strewing white daisies over the grass,
Where frail blue butterflies lightly pass
Blue as wandering flecks of sky—
And the poplars wakened as Spring went by.
Wakening, each in a vanity sweet
Wove for herself an emerald gown.
With here and there a shadow of brown.
While the meadow-mint crowded about then-
feet,
Filling the air with its fragrance sweet.
The long rains drifted across the plain.
By meadow and hedge and mountain spur.
They wrapped the trees in a cold, grey
blur; , , ,
But slender and straight through the beating
rain , . .
They kept their sentinel watch on the plain.
Summer strayed past with the nesting birds,
Browning the fields with her fiery breath.
Chill autumn kindled the fires of death :
The red deer wandered in browsing herds,
And the woods were joyous with singing
birds.
And blent with the wilding gaiety
There came the song of the roysterinj
breeze , , ,
And the storm-wind's shout from the leap
ing seas;
But the poplars held, through all revelry,
Their infinite, grave serenity.
Now in the gloom of the lowering sky
They have scattered their gold cloaks over
the land. • .
And naked there on the hillside stand.
While they wait and listeu till Spring comes
by,
Dancing under a sparkling sky.

Some Day in Spring.
A thousand things I yet shall do
Some day in Spring that blossoms white
Across a fairy sea as blue
As lazulite.
I’ll sing joy’s happy songs again
To the glad gods of pagan Spring
That now my heart, for its own pain,
Can never sing.
And haply then I shall find time
To seek one hidden track I know—
Sharp sweet with fragrance of wild lime,
Loved long ago.
Ah. there amid the trailing vine.
Where eating lichens blot and blur,
I know not if aught lurks in sign
Of days that were!
But this I know: the track still winds
To sunset-purple ranges, where
As in old years pale Dusk unbinds
Her cloudy hair.
The challenges of careless chance
I fain would answer if I might;
And seek lost turrets of Romance
And strange delight.
And, born beneath a wanderer’s star,
I’d glide at dawn past cape and quay
On some tall ship bound to a far
And chartless sea.
There, past the guarded port of dusk.
Where night is singing as she dreams,
Through garden ways of rose and musk
Love’s lattice gleams.
I’d find Hy-Brasil in the west.
Perchance, when I had wandered far—
An Aidenn of supernal rest
Past sunset’s star.
With heart aglow and longing eyes
I'd follow far Adventure’s gleam;
But Life has willed it otherwise—
I can but dream.
Ay me, grey Fate the cynic smiles,
* ' And shackles fast my restless feet
That loathe the drab and meted miles
Of city street!
A thousand things I’m fain to do,
A thousand happy songs to sing
In that fair dawn when dreams come true—
Rome day in Spring!

PREFERENCE FRAUD AND RECI-
PROCITY MAKE-BELIEVE.
The Brttce-Page Government has earned a
fair reputation for honesty, solvency,
sobriety, industry and general intelligence—
a good reputation when allowance is
made for the inexperience of the two leaders
and the fact that coalitions are unwieldy
properties. It will be a pity if this record is
stranded on the rock of fiscal legislation,
even though it may be towed off again and
taken into port in a damaged condition. A
marine disaster of the sort appears probable.
Two tariff measures are at present before
the Parliament. One provides for a reci-
procity treaty with Canada, a country where
the coinage is Yankee and where the com-
mercial ways are New England or Pilgrim
Father with Bluenose improvements. The
other aims at some very much overdue
amendments of this country’s preferential
arrangement with Britain—the arrange-
ment by which Australia gives preference
and gets scorn and neglect in return from
a Government which is so busy petting the
Bolshevik that it has little time for good
customers and good allies. The first measure
gives very much. in. return for very little, and
the second, which tends to put more work
in Britain’s way with no more considera-
tion in return than is given to the Hun or
the Chinaman, is much too half-hearted to
meet an exceedingly bad case. As regards
Canada, the draft agreement provides that
each country shall grant a reduction on cer-
tain articles and shall put four of the other
party’s products on the free list. This is
one of the items under which Canada is to
benefit:—
Linotype, monotype, nionoline and other type-
composing machines ; printing machines and presses ;
typewriters (including covers) ; machinery used ex-
clusively for and in the actual process of electro
typing and stereotvping; rotary graining machines;
adding and computing machines and all attachments.
Free.
That is all classed as one item of Australia's
proposed concession to the generous Canuck
gentleman. This, in return, is a typical
specimen of the Canuck’s proposed conces-
sions to us:—
Beeswax. Free.
The other free items, which are eucalyptus
oil, onions “in their natural state,’’ and
raisins and dried currants, are not much
more imposing. For the year to June, 1928,
Canada sold to us, without any reciprocity
treaty, £4,005,.000 worth of goods, and bought
from us to the value of £240,000. It sold
to Maoriland, which has a reciprocity treaty,
goods worth £2,749,000 and bought from
Maoriland to the value of £451,500. That
was better, but not so much better as to
make the kind of reciprocity which the
Canuck serves out worth while. The best
way to deal with such a customer is to erect
a specially high discriminating tariff wall
against him and then offer to take part of
it down in return for an adequate considera-
tion. Another way to deal would be not
to deal at all.
* * .. # #
The existing arrangement by which Aus-
tralia gives Britain an enormous and costly
preference, in return for which the Clumsy
Macdonald Government has abolished the
scrap of preference granted by its predeces-
sors and abandoned the Pacific in a naval
sense, is objectionable in every way. So is
the proposed amendment of it. Complete
statistics as to commerce and manufactures
for 1928 are not yet available, but those for
N. S. Wales serve as an indication. Where
results are worst, the badness is most directly
traceable to the ludicrous tariff device which
allows a huge reduction of duty on articles
that are of British workmanship, or of
workmanship that is 75 or 50 per cent.
British, or even workmanship that is 25 per
cent. British, which means that they are
three-quarters Hun or some other alien
brand, with part of the other quarter under
suspicion. If there is one line of manu-
facture in which Australia should supply
itself and help to supply other countries, it
is that dealing with woollen goods. Aus-
tralia produces the best wool in the world,
and N. S. Wales produces nearly as much as
all its neighbors put together. When the
Ma State sends the raw sheep-garment to
Europe and brings back clothes it is in this
grotesque situation. It carries the “primary'’
product 305 f miles by rail —the average
haul last year. It pays for 11,000 miles of
sea haulage in other people’s ships, for
manufacture of its clothes out of its own
wool in other people’s factories, and for the
return of its clothes burdened with many
profits and commissions and grafts and
boodles. In these conditions the doing of
our own clothes-making here—not necessarily
all in Sydney, which is at the wrong end
of the 305| miles of railway haulage, but in
inland towns —would seem obvious enough.
Yet 1922-23 was the worst year in the last
eight for the N.S.W. woollen and tweed out-
put, as these figures shows :
Yards Made. Yards Made.
1915- . . 2,447,910 | 1919-20 . . 2,208,846

1918- . . 2,162,486 | 1922-23 . . 1,929,916
There was a fall in other lines, such as
boots, shoes, hats and caps, but that in
woollens, our most natural industry, was the
most decisive.
* * * *
The imports were naturally immense. The
value at the factory of everything made out
of wool, cotton and sundries in the Ma
State factories for 1923 was set down at
£905,975. On the other hand, the importa-
tion list was adorned with items like these:
Allegedly All

It would require too much space to pursue
the other multifarious articles (blouses,
girls’ coats, women’s coats, shawls, rugs, etc.)
to their lair. Even without them, the evi-
dence of N. S. Wales, which is merely one
State out of six, shows that it is an exceed-
ingly solid and beneficial measure of Pro-
tection that Australia bestowed on a country
which gives nothing in return, and which
says, though not by a very large majority,
that Protectionists are fools, or worse. For
though Australia has made a considerable
effort to keep British mills open, J. Bull
himself takes no steps to preserve them, lest
he should offend Cobden’s ghost. Wherefore,
though Britain sends us more woollen goods,
it makes less, and it takes less wool from us,
and a great deal of what it takes leaves the
country again for foreign factories. It would
thus appear that Australia is sacrificing
much revenue and a priceless industry so
that it may be flooded with alien goods
touched up in England by John Bull, the
middleman. What the Bkuce-Page Govern-
ment proposes, in a measure which is about
as complicated as Hokatio Bottomley’s
balance-sheet, is to insist that there shall be
more British and less foreign work in the
cottons and woollens and ironware and sun-
dries which come here under the specially
low rates granted to Britishers. That may
help British industry, but there is no evi-
dence that it will do much, if anything, for
Australian industry. This country doesu t
so much want to shift its mills and foundries
from Germany to England as to shift them
from outside Australia to inside, even if it
doubles its duties in the process. Therefore
it is advisable to cease insulting the Cold
Land by forcing on it a measure of that Pro-
tection which it despises as puerile heresy
and which it doesn’t reciprocate. In other
words, it is advisable to abolish all prefer-
ences save with countries which, unlike
Britain in its present state, have preference
to give in return, and to swear off recipro-
city, save with countries which, unlike Can-
ada, are willing to give more than Id. in
exchange for £l.
THE “AUSTRALIA-CAN’T-DO-IT”
TYPE OF AUSTRALIAN.
There is a type of citizen who conveys the
impression that he has such a poor opinion
of the country and the people, as regards
their capacity for competing with lordly
foreigners, that he wouldn’t stay here if it
wasn’t for the money. Such a person is
W. A. Gibson, 0.8. E., managing director
of Union Theatres, Ltd., and general man-
ager of Australasian Films, Ltd. —concerns
which not only import American photo-
plays on a huge scale, but control about 80
of the theatres in which the youth of Aus-
tralia is educated in the language, manners
and morals of the cheapest brand of Yank.
Australia has been uncommonly good to
the gentleman, and politicians of all parties
have encouraged his exalted ideas of his own-
importance and that of the useless business
in which he is engaged. One of his subordi-
nates has been knighted in Westralia on the
recommendation of a Nationalist Govern-
ment. And the 0.8. E. himself, when about to
leave for America to order a new supply of
Hollywood stuff, was entertained in Mel-
bourne by a company which included the
Nationalist Prime Minister, his Country-
party Treasurer, the Commonwealth Labor
leader and the then State Premier.
* * * *
From this banquet the gentleman evidently
carried away the impression that there was
no danger of protective duties being clapped
on imported films, and that there would be
no hazard in declaring that Australia, so
obsequious to showmen, wasn’t capable of
running a moving-picture industry of its own.
At all events, he gave the Los Angeles Times
to understand that the choice spirits of Holly-
wood might sleep easily in each other’s beds,
secure from the fear of Australian competi-
tion. For these reasons, among others: —
In the first place it would require something like
1,500,000 dollars to establish a production plant on a
par with those in operation in this country. This is
too great an investment to be justified under present
conditions in Australia. Also, we lack the stars and
the skilled directors that have been developed by the
industry in this country.
The traveller didn’t think it necessary to
mention that a score of stars and directors
in the making had gone from Australia to
the U.S.A. because there was no work for
them in their native country. Neither did
he cite the comparatively recent building of
“three million-dollar Union theatres" as
evidence that a production plant would be an
unjustifiable investment. Instead he hur-
ried on to a different phase of the subject:—
Another obstacle to successful Australian picture
production is the dearth of story material. Life in
the bush and other strictly Australian features are
familiar to our people, and, while interesting at first,
Would soon become an old story to the fans, who are
entranced by the productions made possible by the
greater variety of subjects available in America.
They are the words of a man without know-
ledge of or feeling for the land in which he
gets his living.
*** * •
Actually, there is an inexhaustible mine
of romance awaiting development in Aus-
tralia. The various periods of Australian
history, rich in variety of scenery and cos-
tume and in adventurous types of humanity
>—Dutch navigators, French whalers, soldiers
who fought under Wellington, explorers,
remittance-men, diggers from the time of Har-
graves—would furnish material for innumer-
able good film-stories. And there is the un-
exploited field of the pearl-fisheries, w T ith
their picturesque surroundings, diversity of
races and manifold possibilities as regards
the invention of plots. Pictures such as
these, if made by the right people, would be
vastly more entertaining to the Australians,
and probably to the British as well, than
American concoctions which exploit the
monotonous scenery of a country which
Froude found far less beautiful than Aus-
tralia, together with drearily familiar
themes and characters. There is also the
fact that half a million Australian and
Maoriland soldiers went abroad for years
and did all manner of valorous and
romantic things in strange countries.
This Commonwealth has had to put up
with hundreds of turgid Civil War films and
films showing how Private Hornwinkers, of
the Arizona Rustlers, beat the Kaiser on his
own account; but the Digger who extri-
cated Private Hornwinkers from the mess
that brave but inexperienced warrior got
into on the Hindenberg line, and who —to
us. if not to the world at large—is a much
more interesting character in love and war,
has never once figured in a screen-play. And
never will while the Australian picture busi-
ness is controlled by people like Gibson and
blatant gentlemen from the other side of
the Pacific. After all, Australia has as
many inhabitants as Sweden, which, in
spite of natural disadvantages, has developed
a first-class moving-picture industry. It is
more populous, and a great deal wealthier,
than Norway, Finland, Esthonia, Latvia,
Lithuania, Denmark, Bulgaria, Switzerland
or European Portugal. Its achievements in
war have been eminent—and scientific war-
fare is no bad test of national efficiency—
and it has no reason to be ashamed of what
its sons and daughters have done in the
domains of science (Elliot Smith), in-
vention (Brennan), aerial pioneering (Ross
and Keith Smith), literature (Gilbert
Murray), the drama (Chambers, Asche,
William Archer), music (Mexba), and art
(Streeton and Mackennal), to mention
only a few who have made reputations
abroad.
* * • •
In short, Australia should decide, once
and for all, that it has grown up. It is no
longer an irresponsible infant; it has reached
a man’s size and has a man’s work to do.
If the nation so regarded itself it would be
unhealthy for brassy importations or Foreign
traders to issue propaganda to the effect that
Australians are too clumsy or ignorant or
something to make pictures, build locomotives
or warships, or do a multitude of other things
which overseas nations do for themselves.
But the impudent business is perfectly safe
and only too successful —as yet. ,
THE JUDICIARY AND THE
EXECUTIVE.
At a banquet given by the Law Institute of
Victoria to celebrate the opening of its new
buildings, attention was called by one of the
speakers to an increasing tendency of the
day to place the Executive Council above the
Judiciary. This note of alarm was
prompted, doubtless, not by any narrow pro-
fessional sense of rights and dignities, but by
a genuine concern lest a judicial system of
which British people have good reason to be
proud should be weakened by any subtle in-
terference with its legitimate functioning. .
To get a bird’s-eye view of the field it is
well to recall a few of the outstanding
features. There was a day when Judges
were merely the servants of the King, obedi-
ent to his beck and call, appointed and dis-
missed by him. His Majesty, on occasion,
went on circuit himself and took an active
part in the trial of accused persons. Asa
result of such a system it was found that
“Royal favor or royal smiles will sometimes
cause the oracles of the law to return false
and flattering responses.” Judges, being of
but common clay, were plastic in the hands
of their master. With the ejection of the
Stuarts and the old regime came the quick-
ening of Parliamentary responsibility and the
tightening of monarchical bonds. Under the
Act of Settlement the Judges’ commissions
were made quamdiu se bene gesserint; that
is to say, subject to good behavior. Their
removal from office could be secured only by
an address to the Sovereign from both
Houses of Parliament. Royal favors or
royal smiles thus lost their value. Broadly,
the safeguards in our law against Executive
interference with the course of justice are
the independence of the Judges thus secured,
the prohibition of any interference by the
Crown under its seal with the due course
of justice, and the onus of the oath adminis-
tered to the Judge himself.
But, despite these safeguards, there re-
mains a means by which it is possible for
justice to be tampered with, if not defeated ;
and the means are in the hands of the Execu-
tive. The prerogatives of the Crown have
for centuries been a constitutional battle-
ground. Some of these ancient privileges
have been so clipped and shorn that only
their memory survives, whilst others attach
merely to the Sovereign’s name, their powers
of exorcise vesting in his constitutional ad-
visers. One of the most used and, possibly,
most abused of this residue is the prerogative
of pardoning. Acting under the advice of
his Ministers the King may pardon any
criminal in the realm, relieve him from the
rope and release him from the prison. This
power is delegated by the Sovereign to the
Governors of self-governing dependencies in
their commissions, and is exercised constitu-
tionally by them on the advice of their
Ministers. The position then is that a Judge
may condemn a criminal to death and the
Executive may set aside the sentence or re-
duce it to what it will; there is no limit to
the power. In all such cases it is the con-
vention to ask the Judge for a report, but
whatever that report may be it does not
bind the Executive.
Such is the position with regard to the
Judges who are secure in their seats, their
salaries and their prospects of a handsome
pension on retirement. But their Honors
deal only with the greater issues in crime.
The immense body of minor offences touching
the everyday life of the community is dealt
with by the inferior judiciary of the police
courts, and probably for every offender whe
exercises his right of petition to the Crown
on the ground of some alleged injustice at
the hands of “his Honor” a score ask for
relief from the penalty inflicted by “his
(Worship.” But the position of the two
judicial branches is vastly different. The
stipendiary and police magistrates are De-
partmental officers; Judges in function, they
are in fact public servants in the narrower
sense. No statute removes them from Execu-
tive control, no inducement of higher salary
and generous pension is offered “to keep them
clean”; they are bound by the economical
though doubtless sufficient bonds of their
oath and personal honor. It is from their
courts that the traffic in petitions and repre-
sentations flows most freely. Very frequently
these representations, occasionally accom-
panied by personal remarks, come from the
local member of Parliament. The Depart-
mental course in most of the States,. if not
all of them, is to refer the complaint for
report in the first instance to the police.
The reply having been furnished, it and all
papers are sent on to the P.M. for his
perusal and comment. When returned the
Under-Secretary makes a submission to the
Minister for Justice, who determines the
action to be taken. If a mitigation of the
sentence or reduction of the penalty is
thought advisable, the matter goes before the
Executive Council, and his delegated power
of pardoning, respiting, remitting fines and
penalties and so on is exercised by the Gov-
ernor. There are doubtless many instances
in which a variation of the judicial deter-
mination is fully justified, as where cir-
cumstances of extreme poverty and hardship
are disclosed and the punishment inflicted
would consequently operate with undue
harshness. Such conditions. may not have
been presented at the hearing of the case.
But assuming everything in favor of the
practice, that it is exercised with an abso-
lute exclusion of all personal feeling, or bias
and is uninfluenced by any outside interest,
it is yet objectionable. The review of the
finding or the penalty is carried out under
conditions that conceal it from the. public
eye and remove it from public criticism.
One of the essentials of a sound and clean
administration of justice is that its acts
shall be done openly. “Thus,” says a high
authority, “both the inestimable advantage
of publicity is secured and the. unseen but
most potent influence of professional habits
and of professional criticism controls every
judicial word and act.” The system which,
in its broad features, has been indicated, vio-
lates each of these principles. It lacks pub-
licity and is not subject to either professional
or public criticism. It may not happen,
but it certainly is possible, that each stage
of the informal appeal may be tainted with
the hope of saining favor or by the fear of
losing it. The constable reporting may
allow some personal element -a desire. to
curry favor with the superior officer who is a
conduit pipe between himself and the L epai t-
ment—r-to influence him ; the F.M. perusing


the papers may be impressed by the fact
that an aggressive member of Parhament is
“on the job”; so also may the Depai tmental
head, and the fact that the member is a
staunch supporter of his party mas how-
ever judiciallv-minded he thinks he is have
some effect on the Minister’s decision. in
each instance there is a possible something
to gain or to lose, whilst all along the line
there is little or no fear of a public censor.
It is quite conceivable that, with a strong-
willed and unscrupulous Minister in office —
and such a contingency might arise—
grave abuse of the hidden process could be
perpetrated. Every practice that tends to
divert appeals, however insignificant, out ot
the ordinary current of recognised legal pro-
cedure, is a danger to the pure and undented
administration of justice. That justice shall
be done “openly and in the face of the world
is a basic principle of British law.

area. The occupants of the neighboring
allotments, the Wong family of China and
the Ong family of Korea, are equally pro-
lific, work harder, eat less and are better
stayers. Even when the Mikado butte,d into
the domestic problem of Ong, and incorpo-
rated Ong’s allotment in his own, he was
unable to induce his own children to play in
the new back yard to any great extent; and
Wong’s unhappy home is even more over-
crowded than his own. During the war he
made an excursion into the Russian’s dis-
ordered family circle, with great expectations
of settling some of his numerous progeny on
the vast empty spaces which Ivan had had
no time to cultivate. But Ivan refused to
share, even objecting to the occupation of
comparatively insanitai-y outhouses like
Saghalien. This left O Paterfamilias San
with only one outlet for his growing brood;
and Uncle Sam, although he runs his coun-
try on the apartment-house plan and lets
rooms to all the world, recently slammed his
front door on Asia with the conclusive hang
of a landlord who has no need to advertise
for tenants. Remains Australia, whose not
very numerous and not very prolific family
has a hereditary disposition to live in the
back yard instead of in its tropical front
garden. Here is a domestic problem which
0 Hurry-up San could show Australia how
to solve in less than no time. If it came to
a dispute and the controversy was taken
before the League, which is mainly composed
of crowded families without neglected front
gardens, that body’s “conciliatory efforts”
could only be in the direction of inducing
Australia to lease out an empty room or two
for pity’s sake to relieve the crying need of
her congested brother. And Australia’s re-
fusal to be conciliatory on such a vital ques-
tion would put her in the wrong and seri-
ously jeopardise her case if it came up for
arbitration.

The Growing Metropolis of Dropsy
Town.
The manufactures of N. S. Wales are still
on the increase, but it is a slow and unsatis-
factory business, and the figures for the year
to June, 1923, show importation to be grow-
ing a great deal faster than local production.'
Much of the responsibility for this rests on
the crazy preferenee-to-Britain policy, under
which loads of goods, made in countries so
cheap that even cheap old England can’t com-
pete with them, are passed through the Cold
Land, and dumped here under specially easy
tariff conditions. Other causes include extra-
short hours, going slow, and the scarcity of
expert artisans as compared with the multi-
plicity of pick-and-shovellers, milk-deliverers,
municipal block-boys, carriers of parcels and
doers of odds and ends. Still another reason
is the constant effort to concentrate all in-
dustry and all commerce and all population
in one coastal spot, well down in the south-
east corner of the big State, so that the local
factory may be as far as possible from its
inland supply of raw material, and that the
inhabitants may be as near as possible to the
supply of imported finished goods. The pro-
cess of purposeful congestion on one side and
premeditated depopulation on the other is
doing well—-as under :
Employees ix N.S.W. Factories.
Metropolis. Rest of State. Total.
1913 .. 86,263 34,137 120,400
1917- 88,019 32.535 120,554
1918- 92,762 34,829 127,591
1919- 107,777 36,677 144,454
1920- 104,552 40,459 145,011
1921- 110,589 38,287 148,876
1922- 114,864 37,402 152,266
Thus in 10 years the city factories added
28,601 to their stock of employees, while the
poor, unconsidered Rest of the State shows
a gain of 3265. and is now definitely on the
down grade. No wonder it. is calculated that
Sydney will take only 23 years to double its
population, against Brisbane’s 24 years, Adel-
aide’s 30 years and Melbourne’s 36. Every
ton of wool which is put on the N. S. Wales
railway trucks is now humped on the average
306 miles either to the factory or to the lone
congested port of shipment. Hay, straw
and chaff are carried an average of
314| miles; grain and flour, 238 miles;
fruit, 264 miles; and live stock 2f>B
miles. Wheat is still shifted at the
lowest rate (less than half the cost
of shiftage and less than one-fifth the
rate charged on wool), provided it is
moving towards Sydney, but not otherwise.
This makes' it advisable for the flour mills
to group themselves not too far from the
metropolis, so that they may never by any
chance be driven to draw their supplies from
a point between themselves and it, and have
to pay the disastrous charge levied on grain
that is. travelling the wrong way. There
are noisy hypocrites in plenty who talk of
new States, and new cities, and new ports
and decentralisation, but every proposal to
make a neglected harbor available for com-
merce by giving it railway connection with
the interior is damned on the ground that
there is insufficient population to make it a
paying investment. As what remains of the
population is being systematically driven away
by cronk railway devices and other tricks,
the desolation of the Rest of the State is evi-
dently meant to be eternal. There is not the
least objection, however, to the construction
of hopelessly non-paying lines in the Ma State
provided they open no new port, create no
new city, and give nobody a shorter and
cheaper access to the sea than the old way
by Sydney. The last N. S. Wales railway
report shows that of the last 12 lines opened
not one pays working expenses and interest,
seven fail even to pay working expenses,
and the dozen, if lumped together, pay no
interest and earn only part of their expenses.
This batch of derelict jobs cover 411
miles, and are capable of losing £186,002,
which is £453 per mile, in a single year. No
individual with an intellect which duln t
leave off growing before its time supposes that
the people of the capital make. any profit, as
a whole, by this diseased craving for dropsi-
cal size, though property-jobbers and other
parasites may do well out of it.

The Traffic in Titles.
When the S. Aus. Labor Government arrived
in office it was shown a list of persons who
had been recommended by its predecessors for
knighthoods. On the Governor asking whe-
ther it concurred in the recommendations, it
replied that it did not, and would make none
on its own account, knighthoods being
against its principles. So the list was in-
continently tom up, and some very dis-
gusted citizens who had, as it were,
been summoned to gather round the foun-
tain of honor, are still plain misters and
likely to remain so if Attorney-General
Denny lias his way. That humorous icono-
clast presently introduced a bill on the sub-
ject of titles and steered it through the House
of Assembly. The measure provided not
for the straightout abolition of name-handles,
as the young lions of the party hoped it
would (that, as has been carefully explained,
would be an interference with the royal pre-
rogative). but for the consent of Parliament,
signified by resolution of each House, being
a condition precedent to their bestowal in
every case. Not an insurmountable obstacle
certainly, but it was thought that even a title-
seeking sweep-promoter would forego the
gaud rather than have his qualifications re-
viewed by legislators who could discuss them
without fear of the libel law. There was also
the chance that the bill, if passed, might be
repealed by a non-Lahor Parliament, but
such a proceeding would provoke a storm of
ridicule from which even a Harwell might
shrink. A suspicion exists that the thought
of embarrassing Harwell when that gentle-
man returns to office (if he ever does) was
in Denny’s impishly clever mind when he
was shaping his plan of campaign, and that
if Barwell hadn’t occurred to him he might
have adopted the N. S. Wales device of an
anti-titles Assembly resolution, or followed
the Canadian example (which has proved
very effective) of a Parliamentary address to
the King. However that may be. he seems
to have enjoyed himself thoroughly when
piloting his measure through the House. He
recalled with satisfaction that a knighthood
had gone begging when he was Attorney-
General in the Verran Government, a ’‘great
philanthropist” having refused it, and that
Verran had said jocosely, “Wliat about you,
Bill”? Bill declined the gift with appro-
priate comments, but as “the Governor, of
the day was anxious to make an appoint-
ment an estimable old gentleman who had
done a little good, and certainly no harm,
was nominated.” The case of the British
colonel who gave £3OOO to an ambulance
society, and sued it for the return of the
money when no title came along, was quoted
by the author of the bill, as also was that of
the bankrupt Scotch distiller known as “the
Lloyd George whisky baronet”; and the
Rand mining speculator against wdiom the
entire S.Afriean nation rose to testify when
he was made a peer was likewise mentioned
without respect. As for the position in
Australia: —
It is simply appalling in some of the States. In
N. S. Wales the titles conferred have made so-called
honors an absolute laughing-stock. In nearly all
cases titles are conferred upon men of wealth, irre-
spective of an inquiry as to the origin of their wealth
or of any alleged public service. It is a striking
commentary on the present system that the late Sir
Ross Smith and his brother received the same
decoration as hopeless mediocrities with little or no
useful public service. These heroes took their place
as knights with vaudeville managers, whisky distillers,
tobacco and soap kings, land boomsters, and pony-
racecourse proprietors.
Denny might have added an example from
Westralia. In the last distribution of
“honors” a knighthood was granted _ to a
Perth film-showman. The claims of this
gentleman, who has no record of war or
public service, beyond a few well-advertised
donations from the profits of. his picture
business, were reckoned superior to those
of a very capable Commissioner of Railways
who fought with distinction in Gallipoli and
France; a colonel who. revolver in. hand,
received the surrender of Damascus ; a lieuten-
ant who was described by a London journal
as “the super V.C.”; an eminent Director of
Agriculture; a mine-manager with a world-
wide reputation; and an X-ray expert who
has given his services free to ailing hu-
manity in nearly 30,000 cases, and suffered
as only martyrs to science do. A system
which ‘ admits of persons who ha ve made
money out of picture-shows and pony-
racing being singled out for marks of favor
denied to men like those mentioned is
rotten-ripe for destruction, and the shortest
way of ending the abominable business is the
best way. But there are troglodytes in South
Aus. who are of a different o’pinion. By 11
votes to 5 the Leg. Councillors rejected
Denny’s bill.

The Drift in Queensland.
Replying to a question asked by a tnember
of the State Opposition, Premier Theodore
furnished some information which has a
direct and illuminating bearing on the disease
that is eating prosperity out of the heart
of Queensland. On June 30, 1915. the total
number of State servants was 28,121, and the
total salaries for 1914-15 were £4,134,689.
On June 30. 1924, the number of public ser-
vants was 38,422 and the salaries totalled
£9.685,034. There were on the latter date
20,037 employees in the Railway Depart-
ment and the wages bill amounted to
£5,240,471 ; State enterprises gave employ-
ment to 1093 people, who were remunerated
to the extent of £219,833. In effect, the
number of Government employees since
Labor arrived in 1915 has increased by about
36 p.c. (more than double the ratio of
the increase of population), while the expen-
diture has risen by 134 p.c. Naturally this
kind of thing has to be paid for; hence the
gigantic increase in taxation and repeated
liftings of railway fares and freights. Esti-
mating the population at 800,000, every head
of a family of five has to find £6O p.a. towards
the salaries of public servants. At the same
time the population of Queensland’s rural
districts —outside the wool and sugar areas
—betrays a dangerous tendency to decrease.
Archbishop Duhig, speaking on September
17, summed up the position at Miles
(S.Q.), once the centre of a flourishing
pastoral and dairy district, in these pregnant
sentences: —
AVithin a radius of 20 miles, 88 families have
abandoned their holdings in the last 15 years. In
the past five years there has been a decrease of
45 children at the State school, while several State
schools in the district have been closed. At Chin-
chilla I confirmed 50 boys, as fine specimens as one
could find in any part of I the world. It is sad to
think that 75 per cent, of these boys will be driven
in a few years off the soil where they were born.
Farmers’ sons, who should be our best assets in
developing the country, are to-day numerous in the
railway service, in the police force and in the
Government offices.
Of course the Queensland Government does
not want this kind of thing to happen, but it
runs the State in such a fashion that the
tendency to abandon the plough for a type-
writer is inevitable. And at this juncture
the A.W.TT. is moving to fix the basic wage
on the farmer’s shoulders, regardless of the
fact that the farmer, except in the sugar
country, cannot make the basic wage or
anything like it for himself.

The Talking Cure for Disease.
Venereal disease is rampant because not
anything like sufficient energy is thrown into
the movement for its suppression, and also
because the movement is so persistently side-
tracked and obstructed. As an instance of
this on the political side it would be hard
to beat the recent announcement of J. P.
Jones, Minister for Health in Prendeb-’
gast’s Labor Ministry, that the only way
to minimise the disease is to inculcate into
the minds of the children the necessity for
cleanliness and for leading decent moral lives.
It is not the least bit true, but damnably
false, to say that the only way to lessen
this disease, which is killing off our race
and many other races, is to continue tell-
ing people to avoid sexual transgression.
The Church has been preaching this for two
thousand years and more; and there is awful
proof of the failure of the plan of salvation
in the present volume of the disease. If
people will not avoid sexual transgression,
what then? If it were simply a matter of
punishing the transgressors, less might be
reasonably said about the matter; but the
suffering falls far more heavdly upon the
innocent than the guilty. Apparently
Jones’s idea is that nothing effective can be
done because the trouble is so great. It is
a fine attitude for a Minister of Health to
take up. The presumption from. it is that,
if. say, bubonic plague broke out in Victoria,
Jones would tackle it quite enthusiastically
while it w r as not serious; but immediately
it became serious he woiild wash his hands,
put on his coat and declare that the matter
had got beyond measures —all there was left
for him to do was to gather the people
around him and make them a few speeches.

Marriage Lines.
Dear Bulletin, —One of the side-issues of
the debate on the Marriage Bill in the N. S.
Wales House of Non-Representatives was
this statement made by, or ascribed to, Nash,
M.L.C.: —
The Catholic Church has made it a canon law
not to allow the marriage of a woman with her
deceased husband’s brother. That law was founded
on the Bible.
I wonder now if the good doctor has much
Bible about the house. There are five bibli-
cal passages to my knowledge about forbidden
marriages; the index of my sacred tome con-
tains no more. Four of them forbid matri-
mony with Perizzites, Hittites and other
shady characters, now happily extinct. The
fifth (Leviticus, xviii.) gives a long, frank
list of persons whom a decent citizen or citi-
zeness must not marry (not even after the
casual manner of the time), but they are
blood relations, with one partial exception.
There is a general prohibition against marry-
ing the near of kin, but a wife’s or hus-
band’s relative is no kin. “Whitaker’s
Almanac” supplies four closely printed pages
of kin for the guidance of corpses which have
died intestate, and the widow is. the only
relative by marriage who comes in. Even
a half-sister’s nephew is kin, but not a sister-
in-law. The exception above alluded to in
Holy Writ is that a man is forbidden, to
marry his wife’s sister while his wife is alive,
so that when the desirable spinster becomes
a deceased wife’s sister the marriage is evi-
dently lawful, if not even specially commend-
able. Marriage with two sisters at once isn’t
said to be exactly wrong (good old Jacob
did it), but it is set dowui as vexatious. . In
- Deuteronomy, xxv., not only is marriage
with a deceased brother’s widow permitted, but
it is made a sacred duty, and, in the. gently
outspoken manner of the day, the widow is
instructed to expectorate on her recreant
brother-in-law if he fails to propose
and to do it soon. In three, dif-
ferent parts of the New Testament
the story is told of the woman who married
seven brothers in succession. In other words
she six times married her deceased husband’s
brother or six of him married her, in com-
plete scorn of any man-made canon law.
The Sadducees, who told the story (and
incidentally referred to the Mosaic command
that a woman must wed her deceased hus-
band’s brother), and the Lord, to whom it
was told, said no word of reprobation. He
simply refused to be drawn on the question
of whom she would belong to in the next
world. If these simple observations have
any enlightening effect on Dr. Nash. M.L.C.,
I shall be pleased.—Yours, etc., J.E.
Corner-post Defence.
A debate on defence occurred in the M.L.
House of Reps, the other day which was like the
gibbering spectre of debates on the same sub-
ject in the Federal Parliament before the
conception of an Australian Navy had been
driven into the sluggish minds of legislators
who had grown accustomed to leaning
against John Bull as if he wmre a post
outside the pub. A motion to reduce by £1
the vote of £t>o,ooo for the upkeep of Maori-
land’s own homegrown navy for the coming
year was moved by YVilford, leader of the
Liberal Opposition, as an indication, not
that the native or indigenous navy afore-
said should be expanded into an adequate
weapon of defence, but that it should be
scrapped altogether. Having recently been
shaved by a Japanese barber in Singapore,
Wilford has no illusions about the necessity
for defence; in fact, he is full of it. But
he doesn’t believe in Maorilanders being
soiled by the dirty job. He objected even to
his fellow-countrymen being recruited to
learn something about the business in the
British Navy, and gave as his reason that
Englishmen are born sailors, while Maori-
landers are not —a dictum about which the
crews of the tiny steamers that punch their
way between Wellington, North Cape and
Invercargill, round the world’s wildest coast-
line, ought to have something to say. Prime
Minister Massey was as keenly alive as
Wilford to the presence of potential enemies
somewhere in the Pacific, but the only alter-
native he had to offer to his wonderful fleet
(consisting of one ship which has not pub
to sea for years, and which is usually kept
tied to a wharf for fear she might commit
suicide) was to request Britain to lend an-
other cruiser on the same terms as H.M.S.
Dunedin, regardless of the fact that harassed
Britain has already economised on her own
defence to the tune of £7,000,000 and shows
everv intention of indulging in further econo-
mies in the near future. The Labor leader’s
view was that the Dominion’s biggest safe-
guard was the British Government’s foreign
policy, which he interpreted as progressive
disarmament. Altocether the debate disclosed
a surprising unanimity among the three
parties AA'liose dissensions have maintained
the globular Massey in power for so long;
it showed that the lesson of the war, when
only the existence of the Australian fleet
saved the Dominion’s coastwise capitals from
bombardment, has been lost, and gives little
hope of anA r heln coming from the eastern
side of the Tasman to supplement Australia’s
efforts to keep this end of the Pacific pool
inviolate.

“Henry Horsecollar” : The Federal Par-
liament is undisguisedly sprinting towards
recess, with the six State Legislatures
sprinting in company. Recess is the pleas-
ant bourne where the Federal private mem-
ber collects £B3 6s. Bd. per month for
drowsing under a tree, and he loafs re-
muneratively in the shade for as much as
seven months of the year. After that he goes
grudgingly back to work for three days per
week in the remaining fragment of the year,
or four days towards the end of the frag-
ment. His frequent absence, even when he
is theoretically present, is emphasised by
the sorrowful voice of Gabb, M.H.R., crying
in the wilderness for a quorum. The posi-
tion might be improved if the salary was
abolished or even put back to the old £4OO
a year, with a fee of £3 or more for each
attendance, apart from attendance at the
address-in-reply sham and the censure make-
believe, which should be free shows. But
the desire of members to reform themselves
is a limited emotion. When it becomes a
question of once more throwing overboard
the uniform banking, insurance, marriage or
divorce law, the New State business, the
transcontinental railway, the investigation
of the Commonwealth shipping muddle and
things of the sort, or of postponing the com-
mencement of the seven months’ drowse on
full pay, the report invariably is that
“owing to the shortness of the time avail-
able it will be necessary for the Bill to
stand OA'er till next session.” It is con-
sidered rather remarkable that the work of
making a uniform Bankruptcy Act, after
standing over 16 times, may not have to
stand for a 17tli. Things are vastly better
than under the Hughes regime, but I want
to see them so improved that members, in-
stead of rushing into recess, will have to be
carried there by the police.
From the president of the Immigration Study
Commission of America:—
Toward your British Antipodes American ideal-
ists look anxiously, now that we have excluded the
immigration that had been clouding our racial
purity. Do Bulletin readers grasp why our thinkers
so earnestly desird that you hold your Nordic blood
clean ? It is because it is from you that there
comes to us so much inspiration. An example of
this is the “Australian ballot,” as we call your way
of voting. Before we borrowed this from you, blocks
of our citizens were voted like cattle by the bosses.
From Maoriland we have borrowed concepts of child-
labor control, infant welfare, betterments among
women workers. Your Dominions lead world-
thought in such matters. There are three factors
herein. (1) Like our West, you still have the
moral courage born of the frontier. (2) Your
isolation forces you to find unique solutions of your
problems. (3) And, most of all, your race •purity
spells speedy translation of your ideals into actualities.
America while purely Nordic also forged ahead. By
1900 we had commenced to dilute with Mediter-
ranean and Alpine strains our Nordic (almost pure
British-Nordic) blood. By 1920 we were 20 p.c.
non-Nordic. It takes 20 p.c. Nordic votes to neu-
tralise these foreign elements. Thus America is only
60 p.c. efficient from the standpoint of race homo-
geneity. Because your standard of living approxi-
mates ours, you will be selected as the dumping-
ground for the immigration we refuse. Ought you
not put up the same bars as America has against
the Deluge ?

resort to other means. I know one young
man who prepares for the operation of ille-
gal listening-in by taking off his clothes and
going to bed. He uses his iron bedstead
for an aerial, and keeps his phones con-
cealed under his pillow. The ether-waves
are so pervasive and means of concealment
so easy that the police have more chance of
catching the next murderer than of nabbing
the nimble radio-thief. And the goods the
broadcasting companies charge so much for
aren't rubies and emeralds either. In Eng-
land the license costs 10s. and the programmes
are infinitely better. If the Australian com-
panies can’t in trove their service without
charging the present exorbitant fee, the

who are making all the profit out of the new

to the public will simply mean the convert-
ing of decent young Australians into furtive
law-breakers.

“IIopalong” : “Madas” is in error when he
states (B. 25/9/’24) that no person can re-
ceive sustenance under the Queensland Un-
employed Workers’ Insurance Act “without
production of a stamped card certifying to
continuous employment over the preceding
six months.” There is no such regulation ;
a worker may claim sustenance on a certi-
ficate of only two days’ employment. Actu-
ally sustenance is payable for one-half the
period worked as shown by the stamps on
a worker’s card, i.c., a man who has been
employed for ten weeks may draw susten-
ance for five, with a limit of 15 weeks
in any one calendar year. The scheme may
help the genuine unemployed, but the work-
ers benefiting most are those whose employ-
ment is not continuous, such as wharf-
laborers, shearers, cane-cutters and such like
—men who in four or five months make a
sum which, spread over the whole year, would
amount to more than the basic wage earned
by a navvy who pays in his 3d. a week to
the fund all the year round. This is one
of the defects in the scheme —a man may earn
£3O or £4O one month and claim sustenance
the next. But the system has a flavor of
insurance to take away the taste of charity,
and men who would disdain to accept the
“dole” cheerfully line up for “sustenance.”
Unfortunately there is less inducement for
a man to roll his swag and go out in search
of work when he can attend the Courthouse
every week for the sustenance to which he
considers himself entitled. The Unemployed
Insurance scheme may have something to
recommend it, but there is a strong suspi-
cion that one of its objects is to keep in
power the party which supplies the susten-
ance. Row it is supplied is of course an-
other matter, and doesn’t come in here.
♦
“Rotom” : It will take something more than
“Centurion’s” sarcasm (B. 25/9/’24) to
demolish “Windsor’s” condemnation of the
compulsory military training system as it
is at present carried out. I have a 17-year-
old in the senior cadets. He is also an
apprentice. He is compelled under the sys-
tem to subtract certain hours per month
from his preparation for earning a livelihood
in order that he may attend drill. No one in
his. family would object to that were his
training instructive or even recreative. It is
neither. As a junior cadet at school he had
imparted to him all the instructions in drill,
first aid and signalling that in two and a
half years he has been shown in the seniors.
The area officer is rarely on view, and
the companies are under the command of
n.e.o.’s no older and no more competent
than the boys themselves. These make futile
efforts to-. exercise authority, control the
wilder spirits and suppress larrikinism, but
their incompetent methods of conducting the
drills merely excite derision; and to any seri-
ous and well-conducted lad the whole proce-
dure. is farcical. “Windsor” is right in his
opinion that the system needs investigation
and radical reform.
#
“567”: “Windsor” (B. 11/9/’24) suggests
that the “Form Fours” type of drill could
be discarded in our training system. The
text-book definition of drill reads: “The
training of the soldier to execute certain
movements as a second nature.” Bodies of
troops can only be taken into action and
successfully deployed if they are capable
of executing drill-book orders! No doubt it
would be much pleasanter to sit down and
listen to some able lecturer handling the
many “interesting phases of modern war-
fare” ; but let an old soldier) tell “Windsor’”
that this stage of training can very well be
postponed till the trainee has learned his
“routine drill.” “Windsor” criticises his
officers. But dull, uninterested squads make
unenthusiastic officers just as much as the
other way round. To say that voluntary
training would mean a great falling-off in
attendance is too sweeping an assertion. I
am a sergeant in a Light Horse regiment
whose members ride in from outlying centres
as far as 52 miles away. I myself ride eight
miles to attend the orderly-room one night
; r week for the instruction of recruits and
those desirous of learning more of the game.
To attend our last two camps a 52-mile ride
has been necessary, yet we invariably get a
100 per cent, attendance at cainp and drills,
and we have a waiting list 23 strong of men
desirous of enlisting.

“Windsor’s” last word:—
“Centurion's” remarks (B. 25/9/’24) on my
criticism of the compulsory-training system show
that he didn’t go to the trouble of comprehending it.
In common with the rest of my quota, I learned
from my four years’ training (1) how to smear
the-outside of a rifle with grease so that the area -
officer would think it had been properly cleaned;
(2) how to come to the “ready” position with a
semaphore flag (the officers were so keen on' our
doing this smartly that we never learnt how to
signal) ; and (3) how to “form fours.” Hardly a
good practical grounding in the methods of modern
warfare for those who will be called upon to
defend Australia “when she is invaded and fighting
for her life.” My contention is that the dreary
and unedueative senior-cadet system kills the en-
thusiasm of trainees who would otherwise take an
interest in and derive benefit from the Citizen Force
training, uninspiring though that also is in its
present form.
LABOR’S NEW THRONE.
“Another attempt has been made to remove Mr. Lang from the leadership of the N.S.W. Labor
Party. Mr. Dooley, the lately deposed leader, says he had no hand in the movement. The conspiracy to
remove Mr. Theodore from the leadership in Queensland is inactive for the moment.”
A MAN appeared in the Sydney Bankruptcy
Court a few days ago to explain that winning
a Tatt.’s sweep had proved his financial un-
doing ; he had invested the money in a wine-
shop and lost every sixpence, besides finish-
ing heavily in debt. There must be hundreds
of such cases. First-prize money, won by a
hardworking engine-driver, went a while ago
into a pub; at the end of two years exas-
perated breweries with unpaid accounts
stepped in and mopped up the money realised
from the sale of the license —the only thing
left from the wreck. Another prizewinner
who was plodding along in a small way
smashed his previously sound little business
in two years, and suicided. A third, now a
Hyde Park loafer, who is occasionally sent
to Long Bay for a clean-up and rest, de-
scended to that from a comfortable city posi-
tion which promised to develop into a part-
nership. Tatt.’s is really offering a great
object-lesson to the Communists. “Give
people the same chances,” they say, “and
one will do as well as another.” Tatt.’s gives
one here and there a “chance,” and if the
prize is big enough to alter the winner’s
mode of life it seems to do harm as often
as good.

‘‘X2X”: There is a strong possibility that
Australia will be affected before long by the
epidemic of sleeping sickness that is gradu-
ally spreading over the world, the last coun-
try in which it has appeared being Japan.
The disease was first reported on a large
scale in temperate climates about three years
ago, when there occurred a number of cases
in England and along the Mediterranean, and
since then it has appeared in North and
South America and elsewhere, including vari-
ous parts of Asia. It differs clinically from
the true sleeping sickness of Equatorial
Africa, and only resembles it closely in its
symptoms. During the past year 890 cases
were reported in England. Medical science
has been unable to learn anything definite
concerning the causatory factors, and the
death-rate has been very high, especially
among sufferers in middle and old age. In
view of the fact that it is becoming more and
more extensive in Japan and “the East”
generally, there should be a tightening up of
the quarantine examination of the passen-
gers and crews of vessels from affected coun-
tries.
♦
Fkom the inside :
P.M.G. Gibson definitely stated the other day that
there was no chance of the embargo on “a certain
consultation” being lifted; nevertheless, there is
evidence of the waning zest of the postal authorities
in the cn'orcement of the embargo aforesaid. In
1921 Tasmanian addresses to the number of 19
were placed on the prohibited list; in 1922 the
number rose to 27 ; in 1928 it was reduced to six;
and the first five months of the present year failed
to see one new Tasmanian address added to the
list. How does the P.M.G. reconcile his embargo
with the departmental recognition of Tatt.’s which
requires postal detectives to co-operate with the
forbidden enterprise in securing evidence in pilfer-
ing cases? Not long since a Tattersall’s official
was brought to Melbourne, presumably at the Crown
expense, to give evidence on behalf of the Postal
Department. His evidence plainly showed that
letters were getting “an open go,” and the Depart-
ment accepted the statement without comment,
possibly because it was necessary to secure a con-
viction. The evidence also showed that postal
officers were sending to Tattersall’s for tickets. The
character of the “embargo” may be judged
from the fact that the Department receives approxi-
mately £2OO in revenue from each single draw of
Tattersall’s, while up to 10,000 letters are delivered
to Tattersall’s and its agents. Yet P.M.G. Gibson
still mouths his puritanical claptrap i
“Feng-Shtji” : Apropos the Board of Trade’s
assertion that there is no market for Euro-
pean goods in Asia, except amongst the
whites, I took recently an inventory of the
stock of a little native darong, 6000 ft. up
on the Dieng Plateau, a district which has
never recovered from its last volcanic up-
heaval, and is the most poverty-stricken in
Java. Besides the usual native commodi-
ties the shop contained Dutch beer. Japanese
cigarettes, English jam, Morton’s lollies,
French hairpins, Chinese matches, American
benzine and a couple of tins of Swallow and
Ariell’s (Australian) biscuits; and in the
whole district there is only the fourth part
of a white man—a tobacco merchant whose
grandfather was a Swiss.

“Tax” ; The report of the departmental com-
mittee on cancer, just issued by the British
Minister of Health, consists mostly of nega-
tions ; but even these should help to narrow
the vexed problem. Three hypotheses have
been outed: (1) that cancer is caused by a
parasitic micro-organism; (2) that foetal
life isolates small cell islands, and that these
are liable to take an independent growth
later; (3) that vitamine deficiency is a causa-
tive factor. On the positive side it has been
established that irritation over long periods
(20 to 30 years in man) is a certain cause.
Experiments with mice proved that some
could be given true cancer of the skin by irri-
tations from tar in a period varying from
three to nine months; as a mouse’s life is
about two years this roughly corresponds
to the term required for cancer by irritation
in a human being. The substance in the
tar which produces the irritation has not yet
been isolated; it may be a compound. The
only known simple substance with which can-
cer can be produced with certainty is arseni-
ous acid. Unrefined paraffin oil used experi-
mentally on animals resulted in many can-
cers ; and for my own part I have accumu-
lated a mass of evidence which suggests that
the breathing of soot-laden atmospheres is a
further cause.

“X2X”: A section of the N. S. Wales Phar-
macy Act permits anybody to own and con-
duct a chemist’s shop so long as there is a
qualified manager on the premises. The idea
in the first place was to enable the widows
of deceased chemists to carry on their late
husbands’ businesses, and for this there is
something to be said. But the provision has
been dangerously abused. It requires sev-
eral years’ training to fit a man for the com-
pounding of medicines and the handling of
potent drugs with safety to his customers.
In the case of a shop owned, say, by Bilge >
water, the bookie, only the qualified man-
ager is supposed to do the dispensing and
the handling of drugs and poisons. But it is
impossible for the authorities to see what
goes on all the time ; and when the manager
is out of the way Btlgewater is suspected
of making up “scrips” and attending to other
work incidental to the place. In Victoria
and other States the pharmacy law is so
stringent that even shares in a limited lia-
bility co. owning a chemist’s shop may not
be held by persons other than registered
chemists. It w T ould be easy enough to amend
the N. S. Wales Act so as to allow’ only the
widow of a druggist to carry on the shop
when she can show that it is her sole means
of support, and to bar out everybody else
who has not completed the regular course of
training and passed the necessary examina-
tion. Considering the scope there is for mis-
chief in a pharmacy it is more than time
that something like this was done.

Sydney is to have its w’ater and sew’erage
business looked after by a new Board, the
old one having fallen into disfavor. The
measure now before the N.S.W. Parliament
isn’t all bad; it at least provides that tb"’
Board shall have power to raise funds for
its works, and not be dependent upon the
Treasury, and shall keep its own surplus
when it has any. But the old mistake is
made of passing the business over to a mis-
cellaneous body of a dozen or so men, w’ho
will mostly be small place-hunters. The
ideal body for the job would consist of three
men —an engineer, an expert in finance and
a business organiser; and the eight or nine
thousand that the three would cost would
be saved 50 times over in the seven years
for which they should be appointed—with
the safeguard that applies to judges: they
should be liable to dismissal, that is to say
on a direct vote of both Houses of Parlia
ment.

POLITCAT
POINTS
The .League Assembly at Geneva has a
healthy opinion of itself if it really put this
into a report, as alleged;—
Our purpose was to make war impossible, to kill
it, to annihilate it. The plan now drawn up leaves
no loophole. It prohibits wars of every description.
Arbitration is provided for every kind of dispute,
and aggression is defined in such a way as gives no
cause for hesitation.
In South Africa the Kaffir lias been
sanitated and prevented from wasting him-
self in tribal wars till his increase has be-
come something to wonder at. He is being
educated in thousands of school*?, and lie is
no more reconciled to white domination than
the mild Hindu is. Many predict a surprise
war of the old type, and believe that
the populations of dozens of scattered little
towns will be wiped out in a niglht. So the
questions arise: How do you prohibit _ a
rushing savage at 2 a.m., which it; a favorite
hour? How do you prevent him finding a
loophole if he is already over the fence.
And how do you unhesitatingly define him as
the aggressor if he doesn’t care whether he
is or not, and won’t stop murdering to listen ?
A Sydney citizen with a lease to dispose
of attests that lie was “approached,”
allegedly on behalf of the City Council, with
an offer of £14,000, conditional on , lnm
paying £lOOO as tip, bribe or rake-off. There
were, it was asserted* too many claimants
for any smaller amount to serve. If lie
didn’t agree the best offer would be £12,000,
and by a coincidence it appears that the
best offer teas £12,000. The annoying thing
is that so many Sydney people believe the
citizen to the full, and are prepared to
believe twenty more like him. There is too
much rush for nominally gratis jobs of little
honor among persons with little or no visible
means of support except the gratis jobs, tor
suspicion to lie dormant. City government
by a few well-paid expert commissioners is
coming nearer.
Of course, it is a shocking thing for a
nominee Council to throw out a bill passed
by an elective Assembly, as was done in
N. S. Wales last week; and you cant call
that sort of thing democratic government.
But is it any more certain that the elective
Assembly speaks with the voice of the people
on any such subject as the Ne Temcre Bill
—a measure that was probably not men-
tioned before the last election in a quarter
of the electorates? On a question of that
sort a referendum might arrive at the will
of the people. A vote of a House chosen
on a score or a hundred issues certainly will
not do it except by chance.
The bill providing that N. S. Wales and
Queensland should be presented with a purely
State railway (the Kyoglo-Brisbane line),
largely at the cost of States with much fewer
resources, got through the House of Reps, m
due course. The new link will furnish n
duplicate line from Sydney to Brisbane, and
though it is shorter than the present one,
which will presumably become a greater
money-loser than ever, and though it is .good
to cut out one break of gauge, there are
many more urgent works. It will be neces-
sarv to relay the Casino-Kyogle (N.S.W.)
section to make it fit for swift and heavy
traffic, and it is quite possible that it will
be necessary to reconstruct a whole lot of
the N.S.W. North Coast railway, which
wasn’t built with a view to violent exercise.
The Prime Minister described the work as a
step towards a unified railway gauge, but it
might have been more business-like if he
had attended to unifying and “linking-up” his
own pair of 3|ft. lines in S.A. and the
Northern Territory before he meddled with
other people’s less urgent concerns.
The negotiations for the one-sided tariff
arrangement with Canada were begun by the
absurd Pearce during his £SOOO trip to North
America in 1921. Hence no doubt the
ANOTHER “RINGING-IN” SCANDAL.
“At the Federal Labor Party Conference which meets in Melbourne this month, an, attempt will be
made to modify the objective, by substituting ‘collective ownership’ for ‘Socialism’.”
LABOR BOSS: “Give him a coat of paint an ’ ice'll ring him in for the big race.”
LABOR BRAWN : “ Yairs , but all the disguise in the world won't turn ’im into a reco-
urse”
inclusion, in the Canadian list of ‘conces-
sions,” of dried apples (which the Canuck
exports) and eucalyptus oil. Australia has
no competitor in the production, of eucalyptus
oil, and a preference on that item is worth
no more to the Commonwealth than a prefer-
ence on salmon-gum boomerangs would be.
Probably the only reason why Pearce didn’t
ask for a preference on salmon-gum boomer-
angs was that he didn’t think of it. Still, it
isn't too late for him to suggest it even
now.
During the debate in the House of
Reps. on the bill authorising the
Ivyogle-Brisbanc railway, the Priminister
complained of being hindered by “those
who had dragged in such extraneous
matters as the construction of the North-
South line.” If the development of 523,020
square miles of Federal territory, and the
formal taking possession of Unoccupied Aus-
tralia, are “extraneous,” then national exist-
ence is superfluous and life is a cumbrous im-
pediment. The way S. Australia views the
matter is that it paid for the South-North
line with the most stupendous railway land-
grant on record, that the promise to build
it has been systematically neglected, that it
has been openly proposed to break the
promise altogether, and yet keep the payment,
and that the State is now made liable for
a share in the cost of another line, for Lie
benefit of two partners much richer than
itself, and to which no obligation attaches.
The fact that the property which S. Aus-
tralia handed over has been mismanaged
doesn’t show that it is a poor "property, any
more than the fact that an eighteenth cen-
tury statesman gambled away a fine estate
and got a hobnailed liver in exchange proved
anything to the detriment of the estate,
The dirge-like report of the Board of
Trade on the prospects of Australia’s com-
merce with “the East,” recently presented
by Pratten to the Federal House, suggested
the managing director of a busted wild cat
facing his creditors. A perusal of the Com-
monwealth’s balance-sheet leaves the cause
of the pessimism a mystery. Australia s ex-
ports to “the East” in 1901 were £1,226,213;
in 1920 they had increased to £17,337,870.
Between 1901 and 1919 exports of meat in
the same direction went up from £194,071
to £1,581,192; so that if, as was contended,
the natives are not eating the sinewy stuff,
they must be feeding it to the cat. In the
same period wheat and flour exports
increased from £1,151,777 to £6,447,751.
The truth is that the craving for
foreign goods is steadily permeating the
beehive of Asia, and the Common-
wealth’s share of the business doesn't expand
in the same proportion as America’s and
Britain’s, largely because antediluvian
boards of mastodons can’t see their trunks
in front of their faces.
The presence of Labor on the Treasury
benches in Vic. Assembly is becoming so
irksome to Allan, leader of the Cocky party,
that he could not help saying so at a gather-
ing of agriculturists in Melbourne. Why
37 non-Laborites should permit 28 Laborites
to rule the roost was “incomprehensible,”
said Farmer John, but he did not refer to his
own share in bringing about the incompre-
hensibility. It was because the Cockies in-
sisted that John should get the Premiership
that no bargain could be made with the
other Oppositionists in July. So far from
getting nervous over the tirade, or regarding
it as a notice to quit, Premier PTendergast
told Allan that he took himself far too seri-
ously, and that he couldn’t manage to keep
even a party of 13 solid. Allan brought the
gibe on himself—he so misjudged things that
he thought S trad broke would send for him
after Peacock had been displaced.
A curious return concerning British ex-
ports to Germany shows that, not only is a
great deal of Australian and other wool
which goes to England passed on to the Hun,
but much British wool goes that wav —as much
as 124 million lb. in a year. The idea of
Freetrade England getting back to the simple
life and growing raw material to keep Fritz’s
looms busy would be humorous if there
weren’t a million and a half hungry people
in Britain.
A man charged in Tasmania with im-
proper conduct of an incestuous character
was the other day given by Chief Justice
Nicliolls the benefit of the Mental Defectives’
Act. This means that the prisoner is
handed over to the Psychological Branch of
the Health Department for treatment.
Pending the acquisition of a suitable and
separate building for the purpose, arrange-
ments have been made for the housing .of
mental defectives in the reformatory wing
of Hobart Gaol. A Supreme Court judge
or a police magistrate may, at any stage
of the proceedings in a criminal case, call
for a report from the official examiners (a
medical man and the director of the Psycho-
logical Branch), and deal with the case in
the light shed by that report upon the
mentality of the accused. Other States
have M.D. Acts similar to the Speck’s, but
Small Sister leads the Commonwealth in
giving practical effect to the reform.
From the leger reserve
An unexplained mystery of the Leg. Council division
which decided the 'fate of the N.S.W. Fuller Gov-
ernment's Ne Temere Bill was the absence of a
pcny-racecourse proprietor with interests in pubs, and
prints. For a year or more this distinguished
democrat (he belongs to the select band whom the
King has delighted to honor) has been regarded by
Skelton, Ness and other doughty champions of the
Bill as “one of us.” But when the bell rang for
the fateful division the worthy knight’s vote and
influence were missing, and the measure was lost
by two votes. Next morning his paper came out with
an interview in which he announced that he had
been busy buying a bit of land alongside one of
his pubs. There is a vacancy now for an assistant
Defender of the Faith in Sydney, but no ponv-
racing uplifters need apply.
The gloom of the debate on the Navy esti-
mates in the Maoriland Parliament was
lightened by Minister of Agriculture Nos-
worthy. lie resented the insinuations made
against the Japanese, who, he said, had be-
haved “as white men” during the Great War.
In the present temper of our friends of the
Rising Sun, this remark should almost con
stitute a casus belli.
The Vic. Cocky party has decided to start
afresh and try to be solid: three members
had threatened to keep away from party
meetings unless some earnest attempt at
unity was made. As a beginning, the party
resolved to vote for the second reading of
the Tobor Government’s Compulsory Wheat
Pool Bill, but to strive to have the measure
remodelled in committee. Peacock’s Nation-
alists are looking to the Tippah Chambnh to
give the bill its quietus, and the Labor party
would rather have it destroyed there than in
its original home. Assassination in Another
Place would not, of course, involve the burial
of the Ministry.
On the subject of immigration from South
Europe there is a queer conflict between the
precepts of Labor-unionism and the practice
of Labor-unions. The last Australian Trades-
Union Congress declared itself pacifist, ex-
cept as to the class-war, and overflowing
with brotherly love for the workers of all
countries. Relying, perhaps, on these noble-
professions, Splitblockslu. Bananasella and
Fishanchipoulos are reaching Australia iVi
unusual numbers. But instead of being met
on arrival by proletarian bands and fittingly
welcomed, to the internationalist fold, they
are greeted with black looks and morose
union resolutions to the effect that the capi-
talistic Government should put an embargo
on such immigration. The Government was
so informed the other day by one of the
Adelaide unions. Being a polite Govern-
ment, it merely said that it would see what
could be done.
In furtherance of its mission of elevating
the masses, the Westralian Labor Govern-
ment has decided to compete with Tattersall’s
and the Queensland Golden Casket by run-
ning sweeps. The idea, as in Theodore’s
State, is to raise funds for the hospitals, but
Westralia is not so heavily taxed that it
can’t atford to get what is needed in the ordi-
nary way. And the ordinary way in these
matters is safer, as well as honester, than the
seemingly easy way. Somehow the easy
money derived from lotteries hasn’t brought
luck with it to the States which have gone
in for the business. Tasmania has had finan-
cial embarrassments ever since it took Tat-
tersall’s to Jts bosom, and Queensland from
the time it started the Golden Casket on its
thrilling and—in its latest phase—very
much criticised career. Things might have
been different had the two States in question
offered, instead of sweep tickets, bonds bear-
ing interest at, say, 2 p.c., and entitling.the
holder to a chance in a periodical distribu-
tion of 2 or 3 p.c. on the whole issue. Pre-
mium bonds, in short.
When faced with an awkward motion
which aimed at making their organisation a
cold-tea show, the National Federationists,
sitting in Melbourne lately, did some
skilful side-tracking. They referred the sub-
ject to the incoming executive council. It
was a Nationalist Government that put
through the Liquor Bill of ’22, giving ex-
tended powers to the Licenses Reduction
Board, abolishing local-option polls and pro-
viding for State-wide referenda every three
years, beginning in 1930. So. of course, a
Nationalist conference had to shunt the
water-waggoners’ demand for the restoration
of local option with a simple majority to
determine reduction or no license: but it
had to do the job carefully, because the aver-
age water-waggoner is for the moment also
a Nationalist.

ception of his own importance to make, up

stuffy about it, and is said to be urging the
authorities to find the offender. So like a
cow’s owner! It recalls a Bloemfontein
incident which cost officers and men ot C
Company, Ist Q.M.1., some 10s. Per head
De Wet having got away with our supply
column, and the Orange River bridges being
blown up, Roberts’s force at Bloemfontein
were put on half- and quarter-rations, till
even Kaffir corn acquired a value. Thus it
came about that a prime bullock
to Mrs. Badenhorst, on whose farm we were
(the husband was out on commando), ran
his silly head into a bullet from the revolver
of one of our subalterns. It was a pity to
leave him to the aasvogels, and the company
slept on full stomachs that night. Retribu-
tion followed swiftly. Lord Roberts was
then trying the conciliation stunt with
brother Boer, and Mrs Badenhorst pitched
such a tale that the bullock was paidl for at
three times its value, while lan Hamilton
told a parade of the regiment what the C.-in-
C thought about it. They didn t dock the
bullock off our pay then, because we never

the men of C Company to the uttermost ends
of the earth. Long after the S African Mar

“H.F.” : One of my Digger
cobbers possessed a weird sixth
sense. He confided to me that
he always dreamt beforehand
of the death of his friends.
As proof of liis uncanny pre-
science he described the places
where several of our chaps
were afterwards killed and
mentioned their names. Natu-
rally we said nothing to those
whom the predictions con-
cerned, and the poor fellows
never kne w. Curiously
enough, the only mistake I
knew this seer to make was
about his own end. He
always insisted that the shed
bearing his number had not
been moulded; but a whiz-
bang got him at Messines.

“Cartot”: In all countries
where white and colored races
are found together, there is
one little-known test for the
presence of colored blood which
many hold to be infallible. It
is a dark streak down the
centre of the back, just oyer
the spinal column, narrowing
as it descends. I have heard
it contended that this mark,
in tint recalling a light bruise,
will persist in a tarbrush-
daslied family for generations
after the half-moons under
the finger-nails have lost their
characteristic hue, and all the
distinctive anatomical struc-
tures of the negroid races have
disappeared. There is little,
if any, scientific basis for the
test, and many medical men
pooh-pooh it; none the less
the Courts of several of the
Southern States of America
have admitted it as evidence,
and in the East Indies it is
a standard method of estab-
lishing the racial purity of a
Caucasian.
“Quero”: “Marko” (B. 2/10/’24) has not
covered all the handicap the first-born has
to endure. All first children are experimen-
tal : and the rest of the family profit by the
parents’ errors. I am the eldest' of seven,
and I have often heard my mother, herself
an only child, relate that she had never seen
or handled a naked baby until her introduc-
tion to me. She had had no preparation for
matrimony other than one gets in a boarding-
school. My food disagreed with me, my teeth-
ing troubles are still related as something
sensational, and when I was six months old
my mother went into hospital with a nervous
breakdown. All this was, I suppose, inevit-
HER STEADY JOB.

hood with the unconcern they might show

“Peter” : Record number of casualties in-
flicted by one shell? In August, 1916, an
English regiment was drawn up for inspec-
tion at Fi'icourt Wood, near the C.C.S., and
in full view of a German captive balloon.
Fritz sent over one shell which killed 72
men. I helped to bury them.
“Nikko”: Our parson, an active prohibi-
tionist, wanted some circulars advising a tem-
perance rally broadcasted in his extensive
parish, so he invoked the aid of Hone Titi-
rangi, who is mostly
to be found doing
nothing in the main
street of the village.
Hone took the trail,
loaded up with in-
structions and
dodgers, and was not
seen again until 6
p.m., when he re-
turned with a stag-
gering gait and a
raucous song. But
he gave a great
account of his day’s
work. “Orright,” he
said. “I ko all
round. I ko to
Frown’s and I leave
te two papers, and
I have te whisky.
Ten I ko to Smith’s
and I have te peer.
Ten I ko to Jones’s,
and I have te
prandy. Ten I ko
to White’s and I
have te whisky some
more. Ten I ko to
sleep.” “But what
about Green and
Grey and Robin-
son ?” asked the
cleric anxiously—“l
want them to come
and help me at my
meeting.” Hone
grunted disgustedly. “I no ko to tein. ’ he
said; “tey not have te peer.”
“Ex-Warder”: In
my time I attended
nearly a score of
condemned murder-
ers, and found that
the most terrible
and agonising mo-
ment for most is
when they wake for
the last time. The
doomed man gener-
ally drops off for a
few hours’ sleep
during his last night.
For some reason
that can best be ex-
plained by the psy-
chologist perhaps
because of the feel-
ing that all hope
has gone, and that
nothing remains but
to await the end —
the final sleep is
usually a fairly
sound one, quite dif-
ferent from the brief
and fitful dozes of
previous nigh ts.
When the condemned
awakens on the last
morning it is usually
a few moments be-
fore he realises
where he is and
what is awaiting
him. It is then that
men who have before
been stoical break
down. One man
who had apparently
been resigned ever
since his sentence
suddenly gave way
to despair, and vici-
ously attacked the
warder in the cell.
Another, who had
been equally calm,
became a raging
maniac to all out-
ward appearances.
The sudden shock of
realisation is more
likely to cause an
absolute mental breakdown at the last
moment than the slow strain of weeks ot
waiting for the fatal day.

“Verri”: The small steamer Tees, which
plies between Maoriland and the Chatham
Islands, recently had a narrow escape from
being engulfed by a huge tidal wave. These
waves are not uncommon around the Maori-
land coast, and many a ship puts in an ex-
citing ten minutes riding one out. Many old
shellbacks hold them accountable for some ot
the mysterious disappearances of vessels m
periods of calm. On the West Coast occa-
sional great waves, rising out of a peaceful
sea, will run a great distance up the hard,
flat beaches and rush out w'itli a terrific

backwash. Not long ago a family party,
calmly dining in a shady hollow at Ivare-
kare, near Auckland, suddenly found the
sea swirling about their necks: it required
prompt action to save the terrified children.
A closer shave was experienced by a lone
fisherman, who saw from some high rocks
a mountain of water rise against the hori-
zon ; he rushed up the cliff, clutched a pin-
nacle of rock with both arms, and hung on
for dear life. The phenomenon was well
known to the Maoris of old, who had for
such waves a name meaning “evil water.’

“Commenting on Archbishop Kelly’s condemnation
of modern fashions in women’s dress, the Rev. A.
Madsen (Bendigo) advised girls to dress according to
mother’s advice.”
There was a time when girls deferred
In everything to Ma,
And listened, trembling, when they heard
The awful voice of Pa.
The modern damsel simply says:
“Poor Mum! her luck was stiff;
Imagine living in such days!
Thank goodness, times are diff.;
Could anything be more absurd t
We’re altered now, you bet!”....
Those were the days of Mary Jane;
But now we’re in the joyous reign
Of Marianne Jeanette.
Poor Mary Jane was just a slow,
Soft worm—unturned, at that;
Lacking the proper “snap” and “go,”
She was the household mat,
The bottle-washer of the crowd ;
Her humble days were spent
In doing just what Ma allowed ;
She never had a cent.
‘Oh gee, she must have been a flat!”
Think flappers with regret.
Words can’t express the deep disdain
Bestowed on poor old Mary Jane
By Marianne Jeanette.
Those Reverends have much to learn;
’Twould be as wise to beg
The strutting chicken to return
To the parental egg
As modern maiden to forego
Her new-discovered limbs.
Though churchmen reel beneath the blow

SLIGHTED ONE: “I saw you kissing that bounder Binks
just now! Why do you make a chap miserable
flirting like that ”
FLIGHTY ONE: “ Miserable? Good heavens, he enjoyed it!”

Quite useless ’tis to fret—
Not Hercules could pack again
Into the shell of Mary Jane

Why all the World
says “Lager”
IN the Middle Ages beer was limited by law to three qualities. Highest-quality
beer, the drink of the aristocracy, was more expensive. The two lower qualities
relied for their popularity on the quantity supplied for the price. Then came
Holsten Pilsener Lager
Brewed from Bohemian Malt and Hops.
Higher in quality, fuller and more mature in flavour, Holsten Pilsener Lager Beer
made “Lager” a household word throughout the world. “Lager” means “storehouse,"
and no beer is true lager that has not been stored sufficient time to insure maturity.
Those who are satisfied with quantity will still ask for beer If your desire is for
quality, ask for Holsten Pilsener Lager. All leading hotels stock Holsten Pilsener,
but if you have any difficulty in obtaining, write direct to the sole agents

“P. Pinktape”: There have, been queer
tangles in the life of a Melbourne “inquiry
agent." What precisely was the complica-
tion of circumstances which brought him to
this country I don’t know, but whatever it
was he left a wife behind him in America,
and after getting a living in various ways
took up the private-detective business here.
Ope of his earliest cases was undertaken on
belialf of an angry wife. and he duly de-
tected the lady’s husband in a moonlight
wandering with the third side of the tri-
angle. Then his oavia surprise came: that
third party proved the sometime soul-mate
he himself had deserted in America.
“Two Seas” : Once I had occasion to call
upon one of the largest growers of hops in
the Speck. A long trudge in the sun brought
me to his door so dry that I couldn’t have
put a stamp on an envelope, but the broad
expanse of hops surrounding the premises
made me feel that my troubles were over.
But they weren’t; nothing was offered me
save an introduction to a galvanised-iron
tank. I learned presently that he was an
uncompromising teetotaller. “How do you
square your hatred of beer with the growing
of hops?” I asked bitterly. “Man,” he came
back indignantly, “if I thought for one
moment that my hops were used for any
other purpose than making yeast I’d root
THE SILVER LINING.
HUSBAND ( complainingly): “I was just
telling Freda what a wretched wife
she is.”
EMEND : “Tut, tut! She'll probably feel

wretched wives make quite merry
widows. Don’t they, Mrs. Blankly?”

have not decided whether he was an accom-
plished humorist or just a d—d old hypocrite.

“S.C.”: The well-known Bibbenluke sta-
tion, in the Monaro district of N.S.W., is
to be cut up and sold. It once belonged, as
a leasehold, to Ben Boyd, passing from him
to the late William Bradley, of Goulburn,
and his descendants. Henry Windeyer. a
brother of the Judge, was the first manager
of Bibbenluke, and was followed by the late
H. T. Edwards, who held the reins for over
30 years. Like many other properties, Bib-
benluke was first a cattle-station; when the
jumbuck became more profitable a flock was
built up from the Collaroy blood, succeeded
by lieavily-woolled aristocrats from Tassy,
and finally by the famous Murray merinoes
of South Aus. The unresumed portion of
the estate is to be disposed of in compara-
tively small blocks; and thus another famous
holding which originally contained 60,000
acres of freehold land, will disappear The
name is aboriginal, more or less Anglicised,
“J.G.”: Mention of the
names of Dr. Bland and
W. C. Wentworth (B.
25/9/’24) recalls that 100
years ago, when Hume and
Hovell crossed the Dividing
Range, just where the Ileath-
cotc Junction now' stands,
they saw a high, treeless hill
a few miles to the south,
and called it Mount Bland,
after the Sydney doctor.
About 20 miles to the west
a high mountain was named
Mount Wentworth. Mount
Bland was afterwards re-
christened Mount Fraser,
and Mount Wentworth was
re-named Macedon by that
military martinet and ex-
plorer, Major Mitchell, who
travelled across Victoria
some dozen years after Hume
and Hovell. There is a
movement in Victoria to
mark the Hume-Hovell cen-
tenary celebrations by re-
storing the original place-
names. but Authority is
somewhat reluctant to inter-
fere. • Regarding the name
Macedon, one version of its
origin is that Mitchell saw
the waters of Port Phillip
trom the mount and said
“There is Phillip.” and
thought of Philip of Mace-
don. A more likelv explana-
tion is that Mitchell had
already named Mount Alex-
ander, near Castlemaine,
after the old-time world-
conqucrer. and decided to
commemorate Alexander's
kingdom as well. Obviously

Australian sentiment.

C. Vic. Toe. on the Marie Celeste riddle:
Apropos the perennial “solutions” of the Marie
Celeste sea mystery, “Henry Horsecollar” recently
made no reference to one published about a dozen
years ago. A schoolmaster released the tale on the
death of his aged,’ gardener, who had written it out
in plain and homely language. One morning, at
breakfast, during a dead calm that had lasted long
enough to make tempers short, the skipper an 1 mate,
according to this yarn, had a dispute, resulting in
a challenge and bet as to who epuld swim round
the ship the faster. The meal was abandoned, and
all hands, including the helmsman and the skipper’s
wife and child, gathered to see the race. The
carpenter was judge and had the chronometer (which
was the only notable article not found on board
later), and the swimmers dived overboard astern.
As they wera nearing the bow a shark attacked the
mate. So great was the excitement that everybody
on board rushed simultaneously on to a stout plat-
form cage affair, built specially so that the child
could play safely on it right above the bow. The
sudden strain caused the cage to collapse and threw
all the ship’s company into the sea. No boat was
out, nor any rope or ladder, with the result that
all perished save one man, who lay across the
floating platform, which could just support him. He
was rescued days later, exhausted, the Marie Celeste
being thin out of sight. For reasons unknown, he
decided to say nothing, his rescuer’s landing him in
South America. This story accounts for the re-
markable fact that two fresh, deep gashes, exactly
equidistant on each side of the bowsprit, were dis-
covered, caused by the wrenching away of the
platform supports. All the other details are auto-
matically explained if the foregoing “solution” is
accepted.
And “Ancient Mariner” (“There was a
ship,” quoth he) :
“Henry Horsecollar” (B. 25/9/’24) rightly rejects
the latest bogus solution (the ntjj) of the Marie
Celeste mystery; and a copy of the London Times
of Feb. 14, 1873, would effectively demolish his own
theory. At the official inquiry held at Gibraltar,
the master of the British brig Dei Gratia reported
having boarded on Dec. 5, 1872, the abandoned
American brigantine Marie Celeste, bound from
Boston to Genoa with a cargo of industrial alcohol.
He didn’t find the galley fire alight, or a half-eaten
meal on the cabin table; but he did find a sword
that appeared to have recently been smeared with
blood and afterwards wiped; there were bloodstains
on the topgallant rail, and marks on the bows,
apparently made by some sharp implement. No
ship’s papers were discovered, except the logbook,
the last entry in which was dated Nov. 25, when the
Marie Celeste was six miles from the island of St.
Mary, in the Azores. In normal circumstances, the
next entry would have been recorded at noon, so it is
a fair inference that the catastrophe took place before
mid-day on Nov. 25. Ten days later, the vessel was
picked up in lat. 38deg. 20min. N.,long. 17deg. 15min.
W., with only her jib and foretopmast staysail set. She
was then on the starboard tack, but, according to
the skipper of the Dei Gratia, the wind had been
blowing steadjly from the north, and his own vessel,
also bound for the Mediterranean, had been on the
port tack all the time. Now, if all the shin's
company mysteriously vanished (or were murdered)
on Nov, 25, how did she manage, when on the
starboard tack, with the wind steadily from the
north, to drift to where she was found by the Dei
Gratia? Only by a miracle could she have kept on
her due course for 10 days, with a contrary wind blow-
ing and a loose wheel. Any practical navigator

would deduce that the ship wasn't left to the mercy
of the winds the day the final entry appeared in
her log, but that somebody was still aboard until
very close to the time she was salvaged.
“Beaconsfield”: Can anyone suggest a
better nerve-test than a leap with a para-
chute from a burning balloon? 1 once saw it
done. A German shell snapped the cable
of a captive “sausage” near Ypres, and set
the balloon alight. Its two R.A.F. observers
jumped with the parachutes and hit the
breeze together. The unsportsmanlike Hun
kept up a constant burst of shrapnel round
them all the way down, by way of adding to
the horror of the ordeal. I heard they were
given six months' leave to recover. They
must have needed it.
“Van Cat”: Something had happened the
night before in Le Havre, and all that the
girl remembered was that the villain was
a “dinkum diamond.” Monsieur, Madame
and the jenne fille arrived at the camp with
their complaint,
and orders were
issued for all the
Second Divvy to
parade for inspec-
tion. The family
party strolled up
and down the lines,
the girl peering
into the face of
every soldier. Sud-
denly she stopped
suspiciously in
front of a Digger
who in civil life
happened to be a
parson. Everybody
sniggered, and the
sky-pilot blushed
violently. The girl
returned three
times to gaze at
the thoroughly un-
comfortable sus-
pect, who by this
time looked guilty
enough for any-
thing. Finally she
passed on. We
never knew what
happened, but he
asked to be put on
a draft for up the
line the next day.
Sixenate”: A would-be public benefactor
who made a sudden appearance in Fitzroy
(Melb.) was almost as suddenly extinguished
by the police. Ordinarily he was a butcher;
but, chafing at the limitations of his calling,
he made offers to give away sewing-machines
or ice-chests to purchasers of a couple of
pounds of sausages or steak, and handed out
cigars, cigarettes and fruit free with the
gravy beef. He sprang to an immediate
popularity, and apparently was considering
a scheme for pressing cottage-pianos on cus-
tomers who bought sirloins of beef and sad-
dies of mutton, when sundry wholesale houses,
alarmed at hearing how the goods they had
supplied on credit were being disposed oi,
asked the police to have a look at the man.
They found him tearing his leased premises
to pieces; and he explained that lie was
going to make extensive alterations. As-
plialt (wliich lie had dug up from the. back
yard for the purpose) was to go down in the
shop, and a number of other “improvements
were projected. The John Hops rushed him
away, and laid a charge against him to per-
mit of his being medically examined; and
whilst the baffled philanthropist was under
remand and observation, the wholesale firms
dived in for whatever they could recover of
their property. Incidentally, the charge laid
was “insulting behavior.” Yet I don’t be-
lieve .anybody was really insulted by the offer
of a gold watch and chain with four-
penn’orth of mince-meat.

“Billy See”: W.A. still has some ven-
turous convicts. Early last month two pri-
soners on Rottnest Island stole a 12ft.
dinghy, and despite stormy weather set out
for the mainland. The run to Fremantle
mole is about 12 miles, but the escapees
shrewdly reckoned that the police, warned by
telephone, would be waiting for them there,
and headed for a point a few miles up the
coast. Out from the cover of Rottnest they
were exposed to the long roll of the Indian
Ocean, but they won through in their tiny
craft, and made a safe landing in a secluded
spot. One has since been re-arrested, some
camp robberies having put the police on his
trail : the other made a clean escape. The
inhospitable character of the coast where the
fugitives landed was shown when a poliee
launch went round to salvage the dinghy.

The average Australian finds the talk of pro-
hibition so dry that his throat needs much
wetting, and every year there are more
throats to wet. On the other hand the same
talk makes new brewing cos. improbable.
Toohey’s have, therefore, increased their
capital by £200,000 to a round million. The
fact that the capital is in shares of lbs.
is explained by events in the co.’s infancy,
shortly after its birth in 1902. The capital
was £550,000 in £1 shares. After the second
year it seemed that a miscalculation had been
made as to the value placed on goodwill and
assets. Thereupon the trustees of the two
Toohey estates surrendered 50,000 shares on
condition that the whole issue was written
down to 16s. Goodwill was cut back to
£22,500, but that intangible has long since
been replaced by £s. d. The co. has brewed
oceans of beer since the beginning of the
century and has struck a tew rocks, but
water-tight compartments always prevented
serious trouble. The war, six o’clock closing
and competition among retailers all played
disturbing parts. From 1914 onwards, even
into the boom years when other sections ot
capital made such profits that they were
hard put to it to think up new hiding
places, Toohey’s shares were in disfavor.
Despite tangible assets equal to more than
the full value of the shares, and regular
dividends of 8 p.c., prices ranged from below
to a little above par. It was not until ’2l
that the price touched 19s. and started defi-
nitely upwards; in 1920, £37,500 of reserves
had been capitalised, probably to sweeten
the market. Evidently investors now real-
ise* that danger of drastic legislative inter-
ference is not imminent. And that, after
all, is the factor most likely to damage
brewery stock. So far as Tooheys are con-
cerned all else seems satisfactory.

For the umpteenth time, in exactly the
same phraseology, the directors point out
that all outlay on machinery and plant has
come out of revenue; but that hasn’t been
allowed to stand in the way of £15,000
being placed aside for depreciation. Such
depreciation is probably unnecessary and
really goes to a hidden reserve. Net profit
for the term is a record, and its proportion
to total funds is as good as any:—
Average Net Written Profit p.c.

Great assistance is, of course, being given
by reserves. Up to 1919 capital stood at
£400,000. The latest capital increase repre-
sents an expansion of £600.000 in five years.
A large amount of this has gone into hotel
properties; breweries and hotels four years
ago figured at £442,379; the asset is now
over a half-million greater. This and other
movements are shown next: —

Liquid assets overwhelm the liabilities; the
fluids alone among the liquid assets are
almost Sufficient to drown them. The reti-
cence of the balance-sheet and the report
cannot disguise the healthy position Toohey's
occupy. Of course divs. will have to be
found for the additional £200.000 of capi-
tal. but recent profits could suffer a 20 p.c.
shrinkage and still do it at the old rate.

Board-Watson’s last year established a
record in profit-making. The amount exceeds
by over a thousand pounds the big figures ot
the boom year, 1920, when, in a valiant re-
construction, capital was almost doubled by
an issue of 31 £ 1 shares for every 16 held.
First and second prefs. benefited by an
advance of 1 p.c. in div. rates. The slump in
1921-22, with, the consequential necessity for
writing down stock, hit the ordinary share-
holders, but the co. emerged with that one
post-war casualty. A splendid recovery was
made the following year, and now comes the
record. The div. rate is not so large as m the
four years prior to the reconstruction, but to
original holders it is a point better. This
is adequate compensation for three dry years
following a collapse of the company’s pre-
mises, which resulted in disorganisation and
loss. To original holders the div. for the
past 11 years averages a shade over 9f p.c.
Ten years ago capital was £117,066. For
the past three years it has been unaltered at.
£463,978. Other balance-sheet movements

Goodwill stands at £67,660. Reserves have
reduced this intangible by more than half,
hut the balance is still rather heavy. LiabtU
ties of £104,324 are far more than covered by
liquid assets. First and second prefs. com-
prise £82,500 of the capital. They have the
protection of tangible assets over and above
liabilities of £5 for every £l. So far as
prefs. are concerned the security for their
money is therefore overwhelming. For ordi-
naries, there are tangible assets for all but
£33,011 of their capital; and this deficiency
is being wiped out with fair speed—nearly
£25.000 in the past four years. As for return
on their money, the pref. capital is so com-
paratively small that the. 7 and 8 p.c. divs.
respectively could be paid if only half as
much profit was made as in the worst
of the post-war years. The ordinaries’
8 p.c. is not so well assured, but is getting
safer with every thousand of surplus profit
laid by; still, there is no great margin of
profit at present, taking one year with an-
other. The co. is, however, building up a
very valuable goodwill, and this should stand
to it in times of comparative national dis-
tress. Of that distress there is no present
hint: on the contrary, the prospect is so
rosy that it looks as though high-class fur-
nishings will he in brisk demand for some
time ahead.

Mangrovite made a recovery in the last six
'months. For the preceding term profit was
just sufficient to pay the usual dividend of
10 p.c. On this occasion expanded capital
absorbs £4574 in dividends, and reserves are
lifted bv £3244 to £427o—the latter exclu-
sive of patent rights and trade-marks, which
figure at £4231. The company started with
a capital of £23,338, but steadily increased
it. In the reconstruction four years ago,
£22,083 of bonus scrip was issued, and, with
the exception of the half-year which followed
the gift, the div. rate has been maintained
at 10 p.c. In addition the position has been
strengthened over the period by £11,002,
which sum not. only covers goodwill, etc., but
provides the modest reserve quoted in the
introductory table. The extensions to fac-
tory and warehouse, for which increased
capital of £12.610 was raised last term, are
under way. The net profit in 1021 was equal
to 15 p.c.' on the enlarged capital. To-day s
profit represents a shade more than 12 p.c.
To original holders, however, the 10 p.c.
div. represents almost 13 p.c.
The following balance-sheet figures go back
to the period of reconstruction: —

the balance-sheet at a diminished figure.

liabilities: creditors £1845, and taxation
£2437 Liquid and semi-liquid assets
totalled £50,073. Finance is therefore very
comfortable.

The auspicious occasion is not allowed
to pass without Chairman Charles Ludo-
wici saying his little piece about . awards,
taxes and stamp duties. This time
he has added a hymnlet of hate on the
N.S.W. Contract Control Board. Ihis cog
in the red-tape machine has given undue
prominence” to imported goods. Here is just
cause for complaint. N.S.W. Governments
appear to view Australian public companies
mainlv as subjects to be bled for taxes, their
offence being that they have no votes with
which to either reward their friends or pun-
ish tlieir enemies. No medieval phlebotomist
was more calculating. But even self interest
should impel them to realise, if only dimly,
that it will pay them to give preference to
Australian-made goods in the Government
departments. Only a fool who wants to rob
the goose of her golden eggs will starve the
poor bird.

Kabell Mockbell capitalised the tradition
which had grown up with a gloomy, old-world
coffee-room in Elizabeth-street, Sydney. In
the earlier years the lounges of the co. were
the Mecca - of coffee-connoisseurs, domino
fiends and less interesting if more profitable
patrons. But increased popularity played its
inevitable part. The business grew out ot
its tradition and its premises into lug- cottee-
and tea-rooms scattered throughout the city.
In 1020 the value of the tradition and the
fixings, etc., was assessed at 10.001) fully-
paid’’ft shares and half of the £lO.OOO sub-
scribed by the public. Mockbell gave the
public a four years’ preference of 10 p.c
That period expired in May last: and except
in one half-year the dividend has been at the
rate of 15 p.c. p.a. Goodwill still figures
at £lOOO, but that lias not been considered an
asset in the introductory tabic, the initial
deficit consisting of that sum and preliminary
expenses. The best and practically the only
goodwill a tea-shop has is its management;
and examples and proofs have not bomi lack-
ing in these pages. Since the first accounts,
movements have been as follows:

Dividend-paying in a business liable to great
fluctuations should not occupy attention to
the exclusion of all other considerations. A
lower rate and the accumulation ot profits
would fit the co. to meet contingencies with
more confidence. At present reserves are too
slender.

Two years ago Cascade disposed of the
“hard"’ side of its business and confined its
own manufacturing activities to cordials and
cider; interests —including the interest in
the combined beer-brewing eo.—are maintain-
ing such profitable progress as to permit of
a 10 p.c. div., the writing-off of £4400 on
shares in other companies and a moderate
addition to reserves. In addition to disclosed
profits of £20.470, Insurance reserve benefited
by £258, and £lB4O was dropped, without
any comment, into the property reserve. The
only interest disposed of. appears to have
been the actual beer-brewing portion. Pro-
perties and all side-lines remain unaffected,
#••••*
At the beginning of the century matters
with Cascade were distressing, and 26 per
cent, of the paid capital was struck off in one
sweep. For a long chain of years the best
return even on the lessened capital was 6
p.c.; and when finally the co. got into the
running for big divs. Tasmanian breweries
tore a leaf out of Melbourne’s book and
brought the brewing businesses under a single
control. Meantime the properties it pos-
sesses have been slowly moving upward in
value, and every point advance, even if dis-
closed, represents something to swell tan-
gible assets. Visible balance-sheet move-
ments compare thus: —

While mortgages and deposits show a slight
increase on the year, overdrafts have been
reduced by £lO.OOO-odd. Also, w T ith the
growth of industry in the island, the appre-
ciation in the brewery estate and other pro-
perties is probably under-estimated in the
figure given. Providing the Speck is not
parcelled up by Uncle among the unredeemed
pledges before it finds its industrial running
legs, the Cascade looks now to have a bright
div.-paying future. Reserves (though there
may be some goodwill in them) and tangible
assets are both substantial enough.

F. T. Wimble and Co.. Ltd., in March
last offered the public £50.000 S p.c. £1 profs,
in order to extend manufacturing. First
accounts confirm the position set out in the
prospectus. Profit and Loss shows that the
net earnings for the year after providing for
depreciation were £16,056; and another
£14,345 dropped into general reserves. The
div. on pref. shares took £lO67 —-the money
was in only part of the time: indeed, the
last call was not made until after the
accounts closed. Div. on ordinary shares,
also at the rate of 8 p.c.. drank up £7255,
The directors put by £3500 for taxation.
If this is a fair charge for the year, and if
the accounts have not already borne a charge
for taxation, the true profit is that much less.
Subtracting that, and adding the amount
which has dropped into reserves, the net,
profits were £27,801. But there is a doubt
about that addition to reserves; it probably
represents special receipts of some sort.
Liabilities as at June 30, 1023, included bank
overdraft £18,658. mortgage on Clarence-
street property £26,000, and sundry creditors
£16.100. In the present balance-sheet the
overdraft has disappeared, the mortgage
stands at £23,000 and creditors at £13,848.
Debtors have moved up from £40.483 to
£55,053. and stocks have increased by £11,380,
Plant and fittings have expanded by £5OOO-
- but land and buildings at £60,867 are
£3403 less. These movements with the
elimination of the overdraft indicate where
the new capital has gone.

Max Wurcker, Ltd. (Sydney), has issued
another prospectus. An earlier one, with-
drawn a few months ago. asked for £17,500
in ordinary eapital (£5OOO of it was to be
taken on terms by men in the business) and
£35.000 in 9 p.c. cum. prefs.; Max Wureker
was to take another 17,500 ordinaries. The
new prospectus asks of the public only
£30,000 in cum. pref. eapital. The balance-
sheet as at December 31 last showed a sur-
plus of £52.900: there was no goodwill in
that beyond £2325 for “formulas, recipes,

Pioneer Wood Pipe is regarded with increasing
favor by progressive engineers as the most efficient
and economical conduit. It weighs only a third
as much as metal pipe, which materially affects
transport and laying costs, and as it. neither rusts
nor corrodes the purity of the water and volume of
flow are maintained throughout its long life. Other
advantages that recommend Pioneer Wood Pipe are
immunity from electrolysis, frost and “bad soil.”

The directors may go to allotment with only
42,100 shares paid for in cash; and, as
5000 of these are to be paid for m twm years,
the co. will start with only a thousand
or two working capital. Creditors, however,
were not overwhelming on Dec. ol (the
total was under £12,000). Stocks consist
chiefly of pianos, and there are £03,74_ ot
book "debts, mostly owing on time-payment
purchases. The pref. shareholders will be
reasonably well protected; the div.-rate is
high ; and pref. shareholders have the right
to come iu and vote if any div. is not paid,
until it is paid. On that point the prospec-
tus is not as clear as it might be: “the pref.
shareholders shall have equal voting power
with the ordinary shareholders.” It ought
to read: “A pref. share shall have equal
voting power with an ordinary share.” The
average net profit for many years past has
been over 17 p.c. on the capital in the busi-
ness.

Herberton (Q.) tin returns for August
were very satisfactory, the output being
worth almost £14,000. The Arbouin (Stan-
nary Hills) crushed 605 tons for 22 tons
concentrates valued at £2860. _ Tributors
arc showing that there still is tin in the.old
Vulcan mine. The last two months’ re-
turns have been worth £2700, but the grade
is on the low side—between £4 and £5 a ton.
There is always the chance of a rich splash
—there were many in the old days when the
Vulcan was the foremost tin-mine in the
northern State. The Boundary, a small
show' at Watsonville, lias just put through
a rich crushing of dressed ore, 29 tons for
9 tons of concentrates, worth £3l per ton.

The most likely thing in tin-sluicing pro-
positions in Queensland at present is the
Rocky Creek area in the Gayndah district.
Victorian capital has been giving the ground
a thorough trial. Test holes have been put down
for a length of over a mile along the wash in
the creek, and most have shown values over
lib. to the cubic yard. The average depth
of sluicing ground is about 10ft. for a width
of 150yds. Values so far have fluctuated
considerably, but 21b. results are recorded.
Thus far the ground cannot be considered
payable, but further testing is being car-
ried out and prospects point to a satisfac-
tory average value.

Oswald’s, Maldon (Vic.), looks like pass-
ing out of the grip of the family, now that
J. D. Oswald has gone west. A Bendigo
crowd is out with a 50,000 10s. share float.
It will take 40,000 shares, and 20.000 paids
with £4250 are to go to the Oswalds. Of the
cash £1250 is to be put down on registra-
tion, and the rest in monthly instalments
of £2OO. These payments start a year from
registration, save that 25 p.c. of gold won
during the first 12 months will go to reduce
the debt. Tt seems to be a fair deal. Cundy,
the geologist, came back from an inspection
as full of optimism as is manager Kingsley;
they both believe that the end of the old
claim isn't yet, provided prospecting east
of the vertical fault shows that the spurs
off Parkin’s reef are not cut out by the
fractures, as has generally been assumed.
FI. S. Whitelaw. of the Mines Department,
is satisfied the shoots live to the east. So
Cundy, Kingsley and he pick out spots at
600 ft. and 700 ft. where the old mine should
be tested. The show is equipped, water
won’t interfere and the claim has a record
as one of the gold giants of the Cabbage
Garden.
* * * *
Another geologist, P. B. Nye, runs the
tape over the old Langford-Paul Nor they
Briseis Extended claim (Tas.). To-day,
under surveyor Fraser, it poses as the Cen-
tral Briseis. Nye holds that the run of
wash isn’t part of the Ringarooma gutter,
but a tributary. It looks as if he is right;
also when he gives the wash left a 1.21 b.
average he keeps close to the old results from
980.000 c. yds. sluiced in the past. Reserves'
of drift Nye works out to be 900.000 c. yd.,
which he thinks enough for a flutter, pro-
vided cheap plant is in the market. The
factor he omits is the price of tin, about
which it seems reasonable to hazard that if
will keep on the right side of £2OO. No work
is being done on the claim at present.

L. Hansen wrung £10,938 out of Ajax
North (Vic.) in his last six months’ cam-
paign on lOdwt. stone. He milled only 5600
tons, and it needed more quartz or a better
average than that to provide decent profits.
Still he got £lBOO into the till, which wasn’t
bad. The show so far has produced £lBO,OOO
of gold for £23,600 of divs. That sum is
£5OOO short of capital, so that (lie claim
has been run for the miner and the wood-
man. Work has been mostly on the Middle
and McMillan runs of stone. Hansen
alighted on to a flat make off McMillan’s at
No. 7 level, but the quartz isn’t anything
special. To console him pioneering 300 ft.
east in virgin country at No. 9 level has
opened up a big low-grade formation. The
next thing to do is to see if it goes _nt
the slates that carry the Daylesford gold
shoots; so he wants another lift sunk and a
crosscut driven to pick the stranger up 01
the best hunting-ground of the mine.
* * *
Another old friend, the Golden Point,
C'hewton (Vic.), should be on gold, but so
far hasn’t yielded to the pick. M. I. "-*- u ***
chie, of the Badak office, now sponsors it. J.
S Forbes, in charge of the mine, got on to a
new run of quartz that prospected a bit,
but was beaten by water. So a new shatt
goes down, with a consequent re-shutrie or
the capital to get in funds.

B. 11. Central mine fire is still trouble-
some. Fifteen months ago two methods of
fighting the fire were suggested: one to pour
water through the fire area on the offehanee
of good results; the other to seal up tho
whole show. The first method only has been
tried; certainly it has checked the spread, but,
no more. Sealing the mine, though a diffi-
cult job on account of the many surface
cracks, is not impossible, and may yet- have
to be resorted to. The B. H. South, next
door, has unwatered the 1270 ft. level., and
has been cleaning the gangways of filling and
redepositing it in the stopes above. Beyond
a few local falls there is little damage to
the gangways or stopes. Ore-breaking on this
level has not yet commenced.
* * * *
Taranaki Oilfields (M.L.) has started
work vigorously to develop an oilfield at
Tarata, where it holds 8000 acres. Colin
Fraser, formerly of the M.L. Government
Geological Survey, is in Wellington on be-
half of the Collins House crowd, w-lnle A. 11.
Moline, lately superintendent of the Bendigo
Amalgamated, will be field manager at New
Plymouth. Colin Fraser states that the most
modern drilling plant will arrive from
IJ.S.A. at the end of October, and by Janu-
ary or February next it should be ascer-
tained whether oil exists in commercial
cpi antities. A Wellington syndicate has
secured 4000 acres between Inglewood arid
Tarata, and intends to do some drilling.
* * * *
A. H. Collier, chairman of Lake View
and Star , and a director of Ivanlioe, writes
to the Financial Times that the Wiluna
option is his, not Ivan hoe’s. Collier says
that he acquired it when in Westralia last
year, and that, as the £300.000 cash working
capital necessary to develop the property
was too much for the Ivanhoe to handle
alone, he arranged with several friends to
help him to find the money if and when re-
quired. He adds that Ivanhoe agreed to pay-
cost of boring—about £3OO0 —for an interest
in the option. Collier promises that should
a co. be formed old Ivanhoe shareholders
will be offered, apart from their share of
the co.’s interest, an opportunity to come in
on the ground floor.
* * * *
Facts of importance that Mararoa (W.A.)
shareholders should know- are: (1) That the
co. purchased a dry mine at Reedy’s before
making sure of water for crushing purposes,
(2) that its search to date has been unsuc-
cessful, (3) that even if a supply is obtained
the cost of a suitable plant to extract the
gold which is alleged to be in the property
will mean many calls and perhaps disap-
pointment in the end, (4) that as efforts to
float a co. in London “on bore-hole results
only” to further develop the Wiluna field
have nroved unsuccessful, Mararoa’s chances
of raising the necessary capital to open up
anything its diamond drill may stab are not
hopeful. What the co. seems to be in need
of is the sound advice of some outside man
of standing.
* * * *
Mt. Grey (W.A.) has survived the
“floater” stage, for on at least one lease a
promising ore-body has been exposed. Mae-
donnell Ranges Co., being unsuccessful with
its Central Australia operations, despatched
11. G. Pearce from Adelaide to Mt. Grey
to secure options over anything he thought
v'orth w-bile. He inspected the ground and
took a number of options, and has since un-
covered a quartz reef at points 200 ft. apart.
In a costeen 3ft. deep 30in. of 2oz. quartz
has been exposed, and in a shaft on the same
line sunk to a depth of 12ft. a strong sft.
quartz reef of over 35dwt. value is showing.
* * * *
Hampton Celebration (W.A.) is again
obliged to reconstruct. Eighteen months ago,
when funds were low- and hopes high, the
co. issued 25.000 Is. preference shares and
£11,900 worth of 10 p.c. debentures. Pref.
shareholders were promised a big slice of
the profits, and debenture holders the wdiole
of their capital with interest added within
five years, but as only losses have since been
made neither has received anything. It is
proposed to offer ordinary shareholders one
ss. share for every share now held on pay-
ment of 2s. 6d. a share spread over six
months and the balance in calls. Pref.
shareholders are asked to accept one fully-
paid share in exchange for a pref. share,
and debenture holders are urged to take half
cash and half fully-paid shares and be satis-
fied. Something is said about there being
3SPOO tons of 375. 6d. ore in sight, but this
grade of stone is unprofitable under present
conditions. The mine may eventually pay,
but to prophesy that is risky.
Mutooroo Co. regretfully announces that
its search for suitable gold-mines in West-
ralia is still unsuccessful. A number of
claims have been offered during the past six
months. Some the Board considered were
too dear; on others the deposits demanded
were regarded as excessive; others, again,
were rejected after sampling.
Great Victoria, south of Southern Cross,
is about the biggest gold-bearing ore-deposit
that has been worked in W.A. Want of
water has handicapped the owners for 20
years, but the Government is connecting the
show with the goldfields main, so owners
are confident that future operations will be
most profitable. However, “scheme” water
is costly, and the show has yet to be found
in the West that can distribute a satisfactory
profit from 20s. ore. The Big Bell at Cue
and the Great Victoria have tried it, and
neither has reason to be pleased.
* * * *
Brilliant (W.A.) is slow in getting to
work on sinking the Gnow’s Nest main shaft
from the 300 ft. to the 400 ft. level. Possibly
the co. fears heavy water, but as there is no
policy left for it but sinking, it may as well
take a header now as later. Vendors of
this show know’ as much about mining as
can generally be learnt in one short life, and
if the Brilliant people are cherishing a hope
that they secured a bargain outside of the
unforeseen they will be disillusioned in due
course.
* * * *
Radio mine, near Bullfinch (W.A.), has
performed well with numerous small 4oz.
erushings, but lower values at depth is its
weakness. Last crushing was 60 tons for
Booz. The owners do not seem in a hurry
to treat the ore from the bottom level.
Sick of expensive mining, heavy water and
erratic values, the Daisy Queen Co. (W.A.),
has left its old mine at Lawlers and gone to
the Vivien Gem, a few miles aw T ay. The co.
recently took an option on easy terms on
this show, which official reports infer is
much more promising and more economical
to work than the one just abandoned.
■* * * *
Rawang Tin (F.M.S.) is still a mere
shadow of what it seemed in the 1920 pros-
pectus. At that time 20,000.000 yards of
141 b. ground were spoken of, and profits
were estimated at £lO,OOO a month. In the
main the yield has been less than a pound
to the yard. With tin at present high
prices the last nine weeks’ run with Hie
14in. electric plant showed only £2216 to
the good, which does not indicate anything
promising for 2.000,000 shares. The old
12in. steam plant in the same time showed
a loss of £177 on production of 10.7 S tons,
and has been discarded. A suction dredge
may get to work in January, although :liis
had hitherto been viewed as a subsidiary
force to work an area secured in 1922.
* * * *
Vegetable Creek, which lately moved on to
Ardlethan (N.S.W.), has declared its 34th
dividend, and on October 30 will disburse 6d.
on the 57.000 shares which remain alive out
of 135,000 on the register.. A main shaft has
been started, and will be sunk 200 ft.. after
which work on the present ore deposits will
he facilitated and the monthly yield of 16
tons concentrates considerably augmented.
A mining show which sinks a main shaft and
pays dividends at the same time is a strik-
ing oddity.
The patchy Christmas Gift, Cootamundra
(N.S.W.), crushed 272 tons for 2200 z.
smelted gold. The Gift gold is poor stuff,
averaging about £3. The winze on Baulder-
sc-n’s lode has been sunk 66ft. below the
200 ft. level. For the first fortnight good
mineralised ore showed, but since then it has
gone patchy and of low grade. The bottom
looks somewhat better. On the Federal lode
the winze from the 200 ft. level shows oft. of
good ore.
* * * *
On top of its other troubles, Vimy Ridge.
Bega (N.S.W.). has had its dam washed
away. By sinking a well in the creek bed
about 30ft. below the battery, a subsidiary
supply has been improvised. But it is doubt-
ful whether a 10-head battery can be effec-
tively supported in this way, even if better
handling methods keep up the ore supply.
* * * *
Tom Waters, formerly a Charters Towers
manager, has taken charge of the Crown, at
B'om bandy (N.S.W.). He faces a water
shortage problem for a start, -with the sum-
mer just ahead. The market discounted strip
on an official report that one shift with 10-
liead is all that can be wrnrked in the near
future. On 12dwt. dirt one shift means
about ISOoz. a month —to satisfy a register
of 125,000 shares!
* * * *
Lake Bunga Oil, near Lakes Entrance,
Gippsland, reports a flow of gas from its
borehole, now 1100 ft. deep, from which point
drilling has been renewed. The quantity
escaping is estimated at 100.000 cubic feet
a wrnek —equal to about 600 cubic feet an
hour, -which would not run too many gas
plants. Still, even a little gas is better than
nothing. E. Cunningham Craig, the British
authority, says: “These gas shows, whether
in the form of a great mud-volcano or little
gas-pools, are very important evidence, as
without sufficient gas pressure an oilfield may
be very expensive to work and the wells
may not have a long life.”
* * * *
South Africa's diamond production last
vear was valued at more than £6,000,000, or
nearly treble the output for the previous 12
months. Sales were well ahead of
tion, aggregate realisations being £7,733,505.
This was equal to 595. lOd. per carat, com-
pared with 61s. 2d. and 795. sd. for the two
previous years, and the record figure of 113 s.
lid. for the year before.

“Jim"’ Gannon, the only N. S. Wales K.C.
who specialised on the criminal side, died,
last week after a day’s argument with pneu-
monia. Native-born at Tempe, a near-Sydney
suburb, a son of Robert Gannon, he began
life in the State public service, and got his
first taste of salary in the Chief Secretary’s
office under Critchett Walker. Private study-
landed him at the Bar in 1887. Though
knowing nothing of politics—he learned all
he knew about them through attending the
races with Paddy Crick —he was included in
the stopgap Ministry formed by W'addell in
1904: he was Attorney-General with a seat
in the Upper House. But the Ministry was
only a five-minute affair, and Gannon was
never much of a politician afterwards. He
was 64 when he went to join his wife, many
years dead.
“Lee Q.”: Barrister Maxwell, who, with
Owen Dixon, K.C., conducted the defence for
the Plerald (Melb.) in its recent libel
action, astounded the jury by the clear
memory that so often goes with loss of eye-
sight. He delivered
his address with
only a couple of
pauses to verify
certain of his facts.
Not only did he
quote whole pass-
ages from the evi-
dence almost word
for word, but he
brought them into
his speech at the
most effective
stages. So care-
fully phrased was
the whole address
that it might have
been written and
read. Since losing
his sight, Maxwell
has trained his
faculty for concen-
tration to a rare
pitch of impressive-
ness.
JOHN CAIN, Hon .
Minister, Vic.
The Federal Government has got one
trained banker for the new Board of the
Commonwealth Bank: Mackenzie Lees was
until a couple of years ago general manager
of the Bank of Quensland, and he knows the
Northern State from end to end. John Gar-
van, of the Citizens Life, is chairman of
the Notes Board, and is, as expected, one
of the directors of the bank. Others are Sam
Hordern; Robert Gibson, president of the
Vic. Chamber of Manufactures; R. S. Drum-
mond. an authority on wheatfarming and
handling; and McComas, of the Haughton
wool and skin firm. There is at any rate a
big reserve of knowledge of one sort and
another on the Board. The permanent head
of the Treasury and the Governor of the
Bank are ex officio directors.
London ought to be astonished when it
gets the serious indictment lodged against
Governor Bridges. -of South Aus., by the
local Society of Friends. .Nothing so wide-
reaching has been said against a Governor
since Gawler was assailed in 1840. He has,
it seems, spoken of the failure to enforce
prohibition in America: and this is encour-
aging Booze. He advised those attending
the opening of the recent Federal Art Exhi-
bition to see Norman Lindsay’s pictures as
well: and this is encouraging Immorality.
Finally, he told the Boy Scouts that to be
prepared is the best defence: and this is
encouraging Militarism. The humorless
body has sent its indictment to the S.A.
Government, and promises to send copies
also to the Prime Minister and Secretary
for the Colonies, in England.
Inspector J. A. Fowler, chief of N. S.

policeman’s life in

afterwards saw ser-

came to Sydney 30

_ W. Davis Wright, gone over the range at
Yass (N.S.W.), was born at Lanyon station
in 1841, and claimed to be the first white
child born in what is now the Federal
capital territory. His father later built and
resided in a new homestead on the other side
of the river, named Cuppacumbalong
(Meeting of the Waters). Davis Wright has
been droving, auctioneering, station-managing
and land valuing in his 83 years, and a year
ago he published a book, “Canberra,” a fine
little history of the Federal area. The old
chap was hoping to get his “Reminiscences”
published before he passed out. but even at
83 the call was too early.
When T. H. Houghton went west at 67
the other day the Ma State lost an out-
standing engineer. A native of Dudley, in
the Cold Country, he arrived here 34 years
ago to install the pumping-plant at the
Crown-street waterworks, and has since com-
pleted a long list of public and private works
to the aggregate value of over a million
pounds. Specialising in water supply, fil-
tration and sewerage schemes, his services
were in large demand not only in Australia,
but also in Maoriland.
“Buccleuch” : In the Infant Prodigy Stakes,
Johnnie Hunter (B. 18/9/’24) has a com-
petitor in W. K. Hancock, recently appointed
Professor of History for Adelaide Uni. Son
of a Melbourne parson, he won a first in
finals at Melbourne, and went in 1920 as
lecturer in history to the University of
W.A. From there he was selected as Special
Rhodes Scholar for all Australia, won many
firsts at Oxford last year, and secured in a
competitive exam, with other first-class men
a much-coveted fellowship of All Souls’. With
all this in hand this brilliant product of Mel-
bourne Grammar and Trinity received the
Adelaide appointment in June, and he has
still to celebrate his 26th birthday.
“Rio”: Passed out, at Leura, a dinkum
Anzac, whose flirtings with fate were re-
markable. Born in Scotland, he was doing
well on the land in Australia when the call
to arms came. With many other Scots he
enlisted in the 4th Battalion, and by good
work on Gallipoli and elsewhere gained a
commission in the Signallers, and an M.C.
in France. Then his luck changed. A bomb
took off his right arm and pieces out of his
ear, face and scalp. He miraculously re-
covered. only to find that he had a touch of
TB. He threw this off and learned to do
with one hand and arm almost all that he
had previously done with two. But Fate
sent him under a construction awning, where
a piece of iron fell on his head. Again he
pulled through, only to find that his frontal
bone was diseased. Then the surgeon who
was to operate became ill; continued delays
and pleurisy, caused by a chill, brought his
old trouble back, and this time Death won.
Such is the story of John Morrison Smith,
M.C., whom his comrades of the Leura R.S.S.
League followed to his last rest.
Frederick Moorhouse, one of Sydney’s best-
known architects, died recently at 67. An
Englishman out of Huddersfield, he took up
a partnership in Melbourne 40 years ago
and built Menzies’ Hotel and the Royal
Bank. Later he moved tT> Sydney, where
he built the Australian Woollen Mills and
the Globe Worsted Mills at Marrickville
(N.S.W.), and designed the memorial chapel
at the King’s School.
S. E. Hyde, whose draft treaty was con-
sidered by the Third Commission of the
League of Nations at Geneva—it provides for
an international staff of generals, admirals
and scientists to allot the amount of arma-
ment considered necessary for each country
—is a Maorilander, the son of Dr. Hyde,
of Terras, Central Otago. He served in the
Royal Air Force during the Great War,
and afterwards attracted attention as one
who thought internationally. Two books of
his, “The Two Roads” and “International
Government, or Militarism and the Inter-
national Solution,” preach the author’s con-
viction of the futility of war. A few months
ago he was the owner of Langridge- station,
in Marlborough (M.L.), but sold the pro-
perty and went off to London.
Some of the Melbourne trades-unions with
Eight-hour Day banners are wondering
whether they shouldn’t stack the property
away until Time multiplies its value. The
reason is that Max Martin has caught Lon-
don’s wandering gaze with his latest picture,
“Witchcraft”; a representative critic hails
him as “the greatest living Australian
painter.” Max was born in Fitzroy in 1894,
and at the age of 18 went abroad to study.
During the last couple of years his work has
attracted increasing notice, but the only
specimens known in Australia are the union
banners aforesaid; he painted them as a boy
before leaving for England. Martin is re-
turning on a visit at the end of the year.
The sponsor of Victoria’s first village-
settlement scheme, the late Canon Tucker,
of Christ Church, S. Yarra, was once ap-
proached by a small boy in search of a job.
The cleric undertook, if the youngster’s
widowed mother would put him’ into long
pants, to whisper a kind word in the Prahrnn
Town Clerk’s ear. The pants were got, the
word was whispered, and the boy is now
himself Town Clerk of Victoria’s second
city. John Romanis is his name. He played
a leading part in getting Melbourne’s long-
promised bridge in Church-street built.
Died at Sandgate (Q.), Frank Burtt,
chairman of the Southern Queensland Fruit
Growers’ Society. He accompanied L. R.
Macgregor, Director of the Council of Agri-
culture, to the southern States last year;
and their reports paved the way for a review
of the methods of marketing Queensland fruit,
which was responsible for the present com-
mittee of direction. Burtt had been secre-
tary of the Agricultural Society of Too-
woomba for many years.
. Another mon fra’ Aberdeen has just had
his last dish o’ haggis. H. S. Patterson was
the engineer of an immigrant ship to Aus-
tralia in 1873. Liking the land he went to
North Queensland, where he erected various
sugar-mills, including the Millaquin. Down
south he helped with the electrical installa-
tion at. the Macquarie lighthouse at the
entrance to Sydney harbor, and stayed on,
looking after it for 34 years.
“Verri : The wife of Sir Charles Fergus-
son, M.L.’s next Governor, knows her
new sphere well, having spent six years of
her girlhood in the Dominion, when her
father, the Earl of Glasgow, w r as Governor.
She was the middle of three Boyle girls, who
were known as cheerful, lioydenish and ex-
tremely untidy young people, until the eldest,
Lady Augusta, riding a pony (some said a
cow) bareback around the Metropolitan
Ground at Auckland, fell off and smashed
her ankle. This achievement rather scan-
dalised the vice-regal circle, and a subdued
air descended on the family. Amputation of
the girl's foot was decided upon, and Dr.
Charles Haines arrived on a hot afternoon
to perform the operation. The Countess of
Glasgow asked for delay, and that delay
saved the foot. Several of the sons returned
to M.L. later, notably the eldest. Viscount
Ivelburne, a navy man who made himself
much liked in Wellington.
One of the unadvertised successes of Wem-
bley was tli6 handiwork of J. Farroll, a
blinded soldier-worker of the Queensland Red
Cross. His contribution of hammocks, with
spreaders made of silky oak, maple and other
Queensland woods, gained first prize in the
overseas competition, and elicited a letter of
fervent praise from the director of the St.
Dunstan exhibit.
About a long-deferred christening:—
Archbishop Kelly recently announced that next
year, on the 57th anniversary of the laying of the
foundation stone by Archbishop Polding, St. Mary’s
Cathedral will be completed and officially opened.
The site was selected in 1821 bv Father Therry;
it was a Government grant, and was considered a
poor-gift, being unreclaimed bush and close to the
convict prison, the stockade and tha hospital.
Governor Macquarie laid the foundation stone, inci-
dentally giving lt.C.’s their first olficial recognition
in the colony. St. Mary’s Chapel it was called. An annual
subsidy of £5OO was given, but was soon stopped.
This building was destroyed by fire on June 29,
Son-detective PIGGOTT , who tales charge
of all the Victorian murder cases.
1865, when the only casualty was the singled
whiskers of one Anthony Brady, allegedly aged
104, and forgotten in the excitement. The new
building was soon on its way, and Dr. Folding
received a magnificent set of gold plate for the altar
from Isabella of Spain. The new cathedral became
by a Papal rescript a monastic one, but that lapsed
after a while. Attached to it was Archpriest Sheehy,
who died only a few years ago: he was the last
of the R.C. subsidised clergy. Sheehy was appointed
coadjutor to Polding in 1866, but, although his
name appeared for years in the official “Diario” in
Rome as a bishop of New Holland, he refused to
take over, and finally the Englishman Roger Bede
Vaughan was appointed in his place.
Two front-rank S.A. Labor men, Jack
Mclnnes, Speaker of the Assembly, and
Lionel Hill, Minister of Education, quali-
fier for the job of running the country by
making boilers at the Islington railway
workshops in their younger days.
Passed out, in his sleep, James Gale, of Rydal
(N.S.W.), at the age of 95 or thereabouts, For
many years he was liydropath at Medlow
Bath, but later ran the Royal Hotel at
Rydal, then booming as a result ’of the
activity of the mipes at Sunny Corner. He
ran the first coaches to Jenolan Caves from
Rydal before Katoomba and Mt. Victoria
captured the traffic. Cale said he had the
secret of keeping people alive; but cancer
beat him in the end.
The oldest inhabitant of the Melbourne
Courts, “Billy” Williams, went home to die
one recent afternoon, aged 88, after carry-
ing on his duties to the very day of his death.
“Old Billy,” who retained a sprightly figure,
but possessed a squeaky voice at which the
regulars at the Supreme Court had forgotten
to laugh, was Court Crier. The regulations
forbid a man being an officer of the public ser-
vice when over the age of 65, but a way round
was found. No* questions need be asked about
the age of a man who is merely a “tempo-
rary employee”; and “temporary employee”
he remained, in his old job, for over 20 years.
Hugh McKenzie, ex-Minister for Railways
in Victoria, and Allan’s predecessor as mem-
ber for Rodney in the Assembly, has his eye
on Frank Clarke’s seat for the Northern
Province of the Uppah Chambah. The
Cocky party will nominate a candidate, and
as Clarke is President and would like to hold
on to the job—at any rate till he brings an-
other title into the family—it may be
taken for granted that he will have more
than one string to his bow when nomination
time comes round. Rather than see him
without a seat brother Russell might feel
inclined to stand aside. The Southern Pro-
vince without a Clarke to represent it would
be unthinkable, don’tyerknow?
“T. 0.1.” : Samuel Griffith, first Chief Jus-
tice, and Edmund Barton, first puisne Jus-
tice of the High Court of Australia, had this
experience in common : the first criminal that
each of them defended was hanged. Griffith
was called to the Bar in October, 1867, and
was junior counsel defending Thomas John
Griffin, convicted and hanged at Rockhamp-
ton (June 1, 1868) for -the murder of
Troopers Cahill and Power, in charge of the
Rockhampton-C'lermont gold escort. Edmund
Barton was called in December, 1871. and
was junior counsel for Alfred Lester, one of
the Parramatta River murderers, hanged at
Darlinghurst, June 16, 1872.

“Fana”: Re “Phoney's” query as to what
constitutes a good daily walking average (B.
IS/9/’24). It all depends on the road, the
climate and what one is carrying. On good roads,
in a mild climate, a fair average would be 20 miles a
THE SPOT MARKED X.
DAD: “That must be the place where that bloke got shot the
other day.”
day for a man travelling light. Some years ago I
was one of a party of five students who set out on
a week’s walking tour in a part of Vic. where the
roads are not as good as they might be. Our daily
average for an eight-hour day was between 21 and
24 miles, while on one day we travelled just on 30
miles in 12 hours. Two of the party were girls, and
they frequently finished fresh when the men were all
but knocked up. The mistake that most amateur
walkers make is starting off at a high speed instead
of keeping up a uniform rate throughout at the pace
which they find suits them best. Over easy roads
the best rate is a little over two miles an hour, with
a rest of a few minutes about every hour. As soon
as one becomes used to this speed, it is easily possible
to keep it up for nine or ten hours day after day.
“Adamascus”: “Jcobb’s” reference to don-
key teams in the N. Territory (B. 11/9/’24) recalls
that breeding English and Spanish donkeys was carried
on fairly extensively in C.Q. years ago and still
is in some districts. One man has been breeding
mules for years, and will back them against any-
thing of their size for weight-pulling and carrying.
It is a wonder that more use is not made of them,
for they can stand practically anything. They are
used a good deal in the tin-mining districts of N.Q.
for carrying ore. A mule can get along comfortably
with two side packs and one cross pack, the three
averaging 1201 b. over mountainous country, and his
surefootedness destroys any chance of disaster. They
are used on the N.Q. canefields to some extent,
but it is in the mining districts that they best prove
their usefulness. Mules suitable for this work fetch
up to £l5 a head, and soon earn their price.

“C.M.”: Everyone admires my prize
Scotch collie’s head and coat, the set of her ears and
her general beauty; but there’s always this reser-
vation : “Aren’t collies treacherous, though ? You
know, I have heard” Is there anything in this
irritating rumor ? I’ve owned and bred collies,
though not cn a big scale, and have always found
them obedient and faithful at least, if not cs
brainy as other breeds.

“Jimmy Possum”: “Wessel” (B. 14/8/’24)
wants to know whether the wedge-tail eagle often
makes a meal off a crow. I think not. Anyway, in
my many years of bush experience in country where
the big chap is common, I have not known a: single
instance of such a happening. I’ve seen Uroaetus
audax dining on most things, including reptiles, some
of which he probably killed himself; but I’ve never
seen him even attempt to molest a crow. On the
other hand, I’ve often seen the crows dealing out
stoush to the wedge-tail, who usually lost no time
in getting out of striking distance. The scavenger
the Melbourne ornithologist saw a wedge-tail plucking
and eating was most probably a sick bird, or the
dead body may have been picked up by the eagle.

“Jackaroo”: I dunno where “Centurion”
(B. 4/9/’24) bagged his information re the radio
mud at Muckadilla (Q.). There is certainly an
artesian bore on the premises and the precious water
is not allowed to run to waste. The fluid is so hot
that the cook at the pub uses it to dip the fowls
in. Mud baths are not on the menu—but motorists
can have these free of charge on the roads during
wet weather. In my time rheumatic publicans were
the best customers at the baths. No firewood is
bought at the pub—they burn the crutches that
people bring and soon have no use for.
* * # •
“Herodot” : While shooting in the bush near
Steinbrook (North
Coast, N.S.W.), a few
days ago, a youth
named Clark, hearing a
slight rustling behind a
log, fired a bullet at the
spot, whereupon there
rose up an animal of
such ferocious aspect
that the youth fled.
Later his father and
some others killed (he
animal, which proved
to be of the cat type
and about the size of
a fox. It was covered
with black fur, and
had a tail long and thin
like that of the cat.
Local opinion is that it
was a young puma
which had escaped from
a travelling show ; but
there was evidently a
pair of the animals, for
what is apparently the
mate has since been
heard at night howling
around the spot, its
cries being quite unlike
those of any other bush
denizen. Though, one
puma might have got
loose from somewhere,
it seems hardly likely
that two should do so
and nothing be heard
about it. Unfortunately
nobody appears to have
thought of sending the
body of the dead animal
to the city for identifi-
cation.
“A.A.”: “M.S.’s” bandicoot (B. 7/S/’24)
may have only been looking for grubs when it up-
rooted his sweet-potato patch, but I have my doubts.
My experience of the ’coot is that he has an extremely
versatile appetite. Peas just coming through the
ground he greatly enjoys. I have heard the grub
yarn put up in his defence in that case too; but I
have noticed that the peas are always miaeing after
his visits. I have often seen the animals eating the
fruit from blackberry bushes. And once on a mining
field two of the little creatures became quite friendly,
and would line up every evening for pieces of bread,
etc., which we threw to them. Lastly, I surprised
“bandy” one night, at supper. The menu this time
was the carcase of a ’possum I had shot the night
before.
“X2X”: The variety of native sarsaparilla
plant mentioned by “Kepoka” as being valuable in
the treatment of dysentery in New Guinea (B.
owes its efficacy to an active principle,
prohfcbly an alkaloid or a glucoside. It is used
in the form of a decoction, this being prepared
by. placing some of the leaves and roots in a vessel,
“FOR INSTANCE, IF NECESSARY, HE COULD”
MRS. MOSMAN: “ But are you sure you are a handy man?”
APPLICANT FOR JOB: “Well, mum, I don't want ter boast, but me
wife's ’ad seven children without a doctor!”
pounding them well, and then steeping the resultant
mess in water for a day at the least. The other
, plant referred to, the blue-flowered convolvulus of the
coastal regions, is not nearly as valuable. Its
bactericidal action is so weak as to be practically
non-existent, while it has no specific action at all
towards T. pallida, the organism of syphilis, ini the
treatment of which it is useless. In addition, to
apply a poultice of its leaves to an ulcerated sore,
as is often done, may result in adding to the
infection, and making the ulcer worse than ever. The
preparation made from the roots of a small plant
which is employed in the treatment of gonorrheea by
New Guinea natives contains an alkaloid which will
kill the gonococcus about as rapidly as mercuric
cyanide or any of the other compounds used by modern
medical science. Some of these preparations are well
worth investigation pharmacologically; at the same
time it is as well to remember that frequently a
native remedy is valuable in native eyes more be-
cause of some ceremony performed in connection
with it than because of any action it possesses.
* * * *
“Reynard”: Tell “S.M.Y.” (B. 18/9/’24)
that if it is wild camels we are to muster, we need
not go so far from The Bulletin head station as
Fowler’s Bay, south of the East-West line, to find
them. There are a good number in the Kidman
country about Wanaaring (N.S.W.),' which have
bred up from a few that were left, it is said, by
Abdul Wade, of Wangamana, when he sold out of the
carrying business there a few years ago. Sometimes
when two or more carriers meet at Wanaaring, you
can get a good bit of excitement if you join them in
running down a wild young camel. If they catch
and rope it you can get still more excitement by
helping them to hook it up in the team.
* * * *
“McC.” : I know nothing about white ants
in Central Australia (B. 18/9/’24), but in N.-W.
Queensland they are highly civilised and have taken
to chewing tobacco and eating sweets, and there are
reasonable grounds for believing that they wear
pyjamas in their leisure hours. During 1918 I had
a hand in building a store for MacGregor Copper
Mines, beyond the ’Curry, and on removing stock
from an old store we found a case of tobacco which
ants had eaten right through. There was also distinct
evidence of their fondness for sweets ; and the ruined
clothing we discovered would lead any right-thinking
person to suspect that a knitting or weaving mill
must be concealed in one of the numerous red
mounds in the vicinity. I cannot positively swear
that they drink rum, but it is on record that they
have eaten the end out of a cask. I have never
known them to be in green (growing) timber, but
the assayer on the mine did find them eating his
cabbages. I have listened-in to them as I lay in
bed in a bush pub, and I could distinctly hear the
“timber” falling in their workings; the pub later
took fire and it was ashes in 10 minutes. I have
also found them prospecting in a working shaft
(engine-haulage) to a depth of 20ft.
“G.T.C.”: Tell “A. Zed” (B. 28/8/’24)
that his correction of “Saaedi” is wrong. In Aus-
tralia a hogget is a yearling sheep which may or
may not have been shorn as a lamb.
* # * *
“Homfrey Beale”: “Bouragi” in a recent
par. denies my state-
ment that prior to the
advent of the whites in
New Guinea most tribes
buried their dead in
central plots, and in-
stances the Kumusi,
Upper Kumusi and
some of the N.-E.
tribes. The practice
was, until about 40
years ago, quite com-
mon among the masses
in the Kumusi and
Upper Kumusi country.
A few of the upper ten
(chiefs, etc.) buried
defunct near-relations
under their houses;
but they were a small
minority, and the re-
lations had to be very
near. Bathing in the
dead man’s juices was
purely a “lodge” stunt
practised by novices
who, in the ordinary
course of events, would
succeed to high office,
and the corpse chosen
for the operation was
invariably that of one
who had held office or
had been a famous
warrior. As far as I
know, all the north-
easterners buried in
central plots, and a
prospector tells me that
the practice is com-
mon among tribes as
yet almost unknown to
white men. The Motu
and Motumotu tribes 1
know well, and among
them the custom is
universal.
* -*
“Tomb”: I don’t
think “Rufus H.”
has struck anything
out of the ordinary
in the wattle he
refers to (B. 11/9/’24). The pinnate, or featber-
leaf, is the true wattle leaf, but in a great many
varieties is present only in the seedling stage. The
feather-leaves are borne in pairs on the end of what
the average man calls the leaf, but which is in
reality the flattened leaf-stalk, called by the botanist
a phyllode. As the seedling grows, phyllodes only
are produced, but in very moist situations they may
often carry the two pinnate leaves on the end.
Mixing of pollen could not affect the habit of the
tree as suggested.
* * * *
“Lindesay”: About Christmas, 1905, I
coached it from Charleville to Adavale (Q.) with
Steve. Wall, one of the best whips Cobb and Co.
ever had. Before setting out ! had two bottles of
beer packed in ice for our lunch at Middle Creek
change. The wife of the groom there was one of
the rough-but-honest sort, and when we sampled the
beer at the meal and found it not cold enough, I
asked Mrs. Mailchange if she would mind putting
a little of the ice in our glasses. “Certainly,” she

replied, and bustled off. When she returned with
the glasses the ice was in them all right; but so
was the sawdust packing which she hadn’t
attempted to wash off. When we showed our disap-
proval the lady was profuse in apologies. “\ou
know, I’ve never seen ice before,” she explained; then
added interestedly, “My word, you have kept it
cold!”

THE MAN WHO IS NOT ALL THERE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
You find him in many a drowsy town
That nods on the hill or the plain,
In a faded hat with a broken crown
And a coat with an ancient stain;
Old pants that somebody else owneJ first
He is always contented to wear,
And his shirt is torn and his boots arc burst —
The man who is not all there.
He is mostly Charley or Bill or Jack,
Though he’s sometimes Micky or Tim *,
And whether the times are good or slack,
It’s all just the same to him;
Give him a post where he’s able to lean
And grin and spit and stare,
He will loaf untroubled through days serene—
The man who is not all there.
He is shuffling and dirty and seldom shaves,
His hair is greasy and long ;
And strange is the scent, when his pipe he waves,
Of a shag that is vicious and strong :
And what is his living there’s nobody knows,
For toiling with him is but rare;
Yet he seems to have plenty wherever he goes—
The man who is not all there.
And somehow he’s like a part of the place.
Just as much as the school or the store ,
The street would feel lonely or lost if his face
Should chance to be seen there no more.
There’s something about him that gets at the
heart,
His betters we better could spare—
After all, we find we’re not eager to part
With our man who is not all there.

Famous Essex Performance With
Smoothness of Hudson
To the performance that made Essex world
famous is now added the smooth, delightful
operation and reliability of a 6-cylinder motor,
built on Hudson patents.
That not only speaks for brilliant
responsiveness in any service
throughout the wanted range of
speeds. It means —at lower cost
than Essex quality ever sold —you
get the very advantages that
made Huson notable for long life,
reliability and fine performance.
Smooth trouble-free operation of clutch, trans-
mission and rear axle is also assured by the
fact that they are like Hudson’s too.
It is the most talked of car ever brought out by
Essex. Thousands who examine and ride in it
daily are proclaiming qualities never expected
in a car of its price. They call it the easiest rid-
ing car they ever knew. Safe, comfortable and
steady on all roads at all speeds. A special
design that will interest you accounts for that.
It starts instantly in any weather. Steers easily
as a bicycle. Gears shift noiselessly at a touch.
Even those who keep but casual
track of gasoline and oil mileage,
are astonished at its economy in
that respect. And the minimum
service cost policy, continues these
economies in inexpensive main-
tenance throughout all the years
it serves you.
The new Essex requires little attention beyond
keeping it lubricated. That for the most part
is done with an oil can.
The Essex is built and backed by the Hudson
Motor Car Co., sixth largest builder of motor
cars in the world and for 14 years one of the
most substantial concerns in the industry.
Come take a ride. It will convince you that
ideal transportation in terms of economy, com-
fort, performance and lasting reliability is fully
realized in the new Essex —at a price for all.

“Country Fern.”: Like “S.E.M.” (B.
11/9/’24) I have some feathered cobbers —a thrush,
a bellbird and a bush canary, all of which can be
fed by the hand. Being a comparative invalid who
needs much fresh air, I spend two-thirds of my time
on an enclosed verandah on to which the little song-
sters troop twice daily seeking rations. They
come always at breakfast and afternoon teatime. The
favorite item on the menu for breakfast is beefsteak
and buttered toast. For afternoon tea it’s cake
or biscuit. The wee canary is particularly chummy
and perches himself on my bedside table, where with
many flutterings and twitterings he criticises the
litter thereon. The thrush is a very polished gentle-
man and never takes his share of the goods without
asking me very politely, head on one side, if he
may have it; then he very daintily consumes the
small offering. But the bellbird is a shameless
urchin, absolutely devoid of manners. He invari-
ably grabs his ration and forthwith ducks. I think
my affections would be divided between thrush and
canary did not the ill-bred one make up for his
shortcomings with his beautiful silvery song, which
he gives untiringly, morning, noon and eve.

“Gouger”: The paw-paw of tropical
Queensland grows in great abundance with no care
at all. When it is green and boiled it makes a
delicious vegetable. When sun-dried by the simple
OUTRAGED CONVENTION.
BIG SISTER: “Wot's the matter with the poor kid?”
CHORUS: “'Er 'air—look at ’er ’air!”
process of cutting the fruit into long strips and
hanging them to wind-blow in the sun, it lasts for
many months and can be eaten as fruit or made into
pies. When the orange-ripe fruit is soaked for 24
hours in port wine and sugar, it gives mere man the
feeling that he is assimilating the dreams of angels.
When the juice is fermented and turned into paw-paw
wine, it gives him the feeling that he is in Paradise
with lady angels; and when he wakes he’s just as
sure he’s in Hades.
“Jacky itoo": I differ from “Yarrum”
(B. 25/9/’24), who says that rabbits will scoot from
a motor-car light) My experience is that Bunny
will either sit stock-still in the dazzle or, as “Yar-
rum” says of hares, flv before the speeding vehicle
for miles. I have run over 15 rabbits (paralysed
by my headlights) on a trip of 21 miles from
Cooma to Berridale (N.S.W.).
# * * *
“D.11.R.”: Many landholders in the west
and nor’-west of N.S.W.
have this year been ex-
perimenting with two
absurdly simple
methods of destroying
rabbits and both
proved wonderfullv
effective. One is to
stuff all entrances to
burrows with ordinary
newspaper. When the
rabbits, finding the exit
blocked, attempt to
scratch their way
through, the rustle of
the paper and the noise
of dirt falling on it
frightens them, and,
rather than face the
inexplicable, they die in
the burrows. The second
ruse is to block the
entrances with burnt
rag. Probably governed
by hereditary memories
of the fire-menace, the
rodents refrain from
attempting to dig their
way out, and die. f
have recently Seen sev-
eral burrows which had
been treated by these
methods, and in each
case numbers of dead
bunnies were found.
“Larrapinta”: “Ford son” (B. 4/9/’24),
who lost the sight of an eye through being struck
by a knot from his whiplash, reminds me. On Thy-
lungra station (W. 0.), in 1890, Jack Randall cracked
his stockwhip and a piece of the greenhide “fall”
struck Harry Duggan, a dozen yards in front, pene-
trated his clothes, and lodged in the flesh between
his ribs. Its extraction was a painful job, and it
left a suppurating wound which didn’t heal for nearly
a year.
* * * *
“Capta”: Two of us were walking across
a native-grass plain when the dogs put up a wallaby.
He dodged and circled, but, being far from cover and
in desperate straits, suddenly turned and, making
straight for me, shoved his head between my feet and
cowered there, trembling. I was too late to vindi-
cate his trust —the cannibal with me had a waddy
and used it. I know that birds will fly close to
humans when hard-pressed, but I had never known a
wild animal to seek such refuge before.
* * * *
“Werrimee”: The hollow log can challenge
even the kerosene-tin for general usefulness in the
bush. A big one makes a good water-
cask, and it is commonly used for
sinking in sandy creeks to form dip-
ping holes when the water is low.
Washing-tubs, cradles, meat casks, dog
kennels, coops for sitting hens, fern
and flower pots, and bins for holding
flour, grain or chaff can all be
fashioned out of it. Small clean, hol-
low gum limbs make buckets. Split
a log down the centre, and nail a bit
of hardwood board across each end,
and you have a pig or fowl trough.
For horse troughs a log about ISin. or
2ft. in diameter is halved, but for
spouting or guttering straight saplings
split down the centre do nicely. Un-
split, they make water-pipes. In far-
back regions, Binghi uses handy
lengths, plugged at both ends, as
water-carriers, and sometimes those of
larger girth for coffins.
“Landa”: That dog “Canis”
speaks of (B. 11/9/’24) must have
been out for a stroll only, even mak-
ing all allowance for the 30 miles
through fresh snow. Duane Bros., of
Mvrtleford (Vic.), took a cattle-dog in
the train from their home town to
vVagga (N.S.W.), a distance of approxi-
mately 300 miles. They lost the
tyke at Wagga, and came away with
their stock, regretting the absence of
their best canine helper. Six weeks
afterwards a starved, pad-bleeding
wreck arrived at the back door at
Mvrtleford and fell exhausted. Care-
ful attention and good feeding restored
the dog to his old condition, and he
gave years of service in the heavy hill
country of the district.
“Nulla”: Archdeacon Colliek, the popu-
lar padra and friend of Westralian abos., mentioned
recently, once had his virtue vindicated by a
sick lubra whom he had taken under his wing. The
lady was an expectant mother, and there were other
complications, which a medico said was colic. “No,
no!” protested the gin when she heard the diagnosis.
“Not- Mitta Colliek—belonga policeman.”
“F. Clinton”: The morals of the female
quail are extremely loose. She is much bigger than
the male, and presumes upon this fact to enforce her
own ideas as to the part he should play in their
home life. After she has laid her eggs, she sits
on them for a few days, and then hands over the job
to the old man while she goes out pirating. Some-
times she returns to give him some assistance in the
rearing of the brood, but as a rule she likes her
new gentleman friend better and simply stays away.
ATTENDING TO BUSINESS.
COW COCKY: “Ter always dorm ’ere talkin’ to Lis since yer wife
died. ’Ow do you ever expect to get yer cows milked,?”
NEIGHBOR : “By marryin’ Lis, o’ course.”
The only redeeming feature about the whole business
from the old man’s point of view is that once he
has completed the duties of a father he is free to
introduce himself and his prospects to another lady
—who in due course treats him just as shabbily ns
his first wife.
* * * *
“Lily-Beale”: Here’s another for the
Queer Accident Cup. While fencing the .other day
W. R. Sharpe, of Mountain Ash, near Goulburn
(N.S.W.), left part of a coil of No. 12 fencing
wire hanging on a post. A heifer poked her head
through it, then made for the bush. The wire mean-
while unrolled, but eight turns remained round the
beast’s neck, and when a strand caught in a log
the coils tightened and choked her.
* * * *
“Homfrey Beale": The other day two men
in a road-making gang at Rankin’s Springs
(N.S.W.) had trenched and fired a tree when a hen
robin was noticed sit-
ting on a nest in it.
In a short while the
smoke drove her off.
She wheeled agitatedly
round the tree-top,
uttering distressful
cries and making swift
dives on to the* nest,
only to be driven cff
again in a few seconds
by the smoke and
r a p i d 1 y-mounting
flames. Several times
this was repeated, then
the bird finally dived
through the thick
smoke and heat, and
remained on the nest
till the tree fell. She
was dead, and both legs
were thrust deeply
through the material
of the nest as though
she bad feared that her
mother-love might fail
before the instinct of
self-preservation, and
had purposely enmeshed
herself. The eggs were
found to contain young.
Thirty men, of whom
I was one, witnessed
the incident, and most
of us would have given
a bit not to have had
to.
“Parama” : Among the river natives of the
Western Division of New Guinea there is one dish
on the menu that must take a deuce of a lot of
getting used to. I recently watched the boss chef
of a village preparing a mess of it, which was to
form one course in a big-feller feast to be held that
night. Hundreds of young 4in.-long mangrove
sprouts had been piled up on heated flat stones
and then covered with sheets of bark, palm leaves,
damp grass, and finally earth. They were left there
for some hours to soften by steaming, and were
then taken out and pounded in a crude stone mortar.
When the result appeared as a slimy grey slush it
was tasted, declared 0.K., scraped off the stone and
the hardwood club that had pounded it, and set aside
to keep hot till dinner-time. I sampled it, on prin-
ciple, but am afraid I hurt the chef’s feelings by
spitting the stuff out again. I wouldn't have swal-
lowed it for a fiver.
“Henry Pannikin”: All the hold-ups aren’t
in Melbourne. At Ballina (N.S.W.) a demented Hin-
doo, after threatening to slice a couple of his brethren
into mincemeat, took to the bush. An excited
female, driving a just as highly excited prad, dashed
into the main street and declared that she had spotted
the wanted man. “He’s about half a mile out, danc-
ing round and round a stump on the side of the road.
Three police, accompanied by a body of volunteers, set
out, and, dark though it was, they soon made out
a figure which seemed to bo indulging in aimless gyra-
tion. Converging on their quarry, they finally rushed
him. There was a mixture of arms, legs and blood-
curdling yells before the man was borne down by the
weight of numbers. The handcuffs were being snapped
on when a voice arose in perfectly good Australian.
“Gripes!” it roared, “take all I have, it ain’t much,
but spare me blanky life.” It proved to be a local
apiculturist who had been catching a swarm of way-
ward bees in the dark. He thought his assailants
were footpads.
* * * *
“Ragar”: Among other arts which have
decayed among the natives of Papua and the sur-
rounding islands is that of line- and rope-making.
In old days the natives living on the Fly River and
along the coast made lines with which they caught
and hauled in sharks, and big fellows at that. Their
bush ropes, too, could hold any wild boar safely.
Now there’s not one of them knows the first thing
about making a line worthy of the name. The old
pride in fashioning really good tackle is dead. They
still catch sharks, which are considered good kaikai,
and the managers of the plantations buy them for
the plantation “boys,” the price generally being
somewhere about 10 sticks of trade tobacco (26 sticks
go the pound). But both hooks and lines are of
foreign manufacture.
.*# * *
“Gotiger”: I saw some spotted-gum logs
the other day taken from a bridge out Copmanhurst
way (N.S.W.). The squared logs had been put in
along with ironbark timber 30 years ago. The
ironbark girdere were worn out, 30 years of hoofs
and iron-rimmed tyres having ground through them:
but the spotted gum, having resilience, had not
splintered. These logs were therefore simply re-
dressed and put in again, and should be good for
another 30 years.
* « * *
“U.8.D.”: I found a yearling poddy one
morning with a round hole eaten out of the centre
of his back, exposing the bone. The hand could be
pushed in the hole either way along the back-bone
for about four inches. There were fine scratches on
the ears and the buttock. The calf was alive but
had to be destroyed. What was it did the damage?
On another occasion I found a large wallaby dead
with a circular hole eaten out of the side of the
chest just behind the arm. The organs of the chest
had apparently been eaten. The stomach was also
quite clean of all organs, but these were lying on
the grass. There were small blood spots on the
front and back of the throat, and marks like teeth
might make. Again, what did it?
THE ELEMENTS OE LOGIC.
“I hate that bloke Flanagin.”
“Well, what do yer go into the pub with ’im fer?”
“Flanagin’s beer ain’t Elan a gin.”
“FI.V.E.”: For the two most widely dis-
tributed and hardy Australian birds, able to subsist
practically anywhere, 1 award the palm to the black-
and-white fantail (William Wagtail) and the Aus-
tralian pipit (ground lark). Explorers in the heart
of Westralian deserts have found Wm. Wagtail
quite at home about any little oasis or chance rock-
pools, building his neat cup nest and rearing his
chicks in the wilderness. In nearly all civilised
quarters the black fantail, or “shepherds' com-
panion,” is a familiar and cheery friend, just as the
old laughing jack is. The ground-lark ranges widely
from the snow-clad slopes of Kosciusko, through open
forests, even to the wind-swept sea-beaches; but to
mountain gullies, where the wagtail is sometimes but
not often seen, the pipit, I think, cometh not. On
the whole, climatic conditions and environment —
so important to many birds—seem to trouble these
two hardy fowls but little.
THE OLD SHEARER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
W.A.
From Murchison to Winning Pool,
From Onslow Roads to Marble Bar,
I ve followed in the wake of wool,
In camel team and motor-ear ;
I ve toiled in sheds whose temperature
W’ould ever beat the century,
Where heat and flies and stale manure
Were items in our agony ;
Where mates would shout at knock-off bell:
“Well, what’s your tally, anyway?
Two-forty! Never! Go to Hell—
You’ll learn to speak the truth some day.”
But when the gang-boss called the tot,
Mine never fell below the line.
They called me Daddy of the lot ;
The title “Shearer King” was mine.
And when Carnarvon town we reached,
The shearer then became a toff.
Ilis cheque was nailed till he was beached,
Or till a south boat lured him off'
To Perth, with other wiles and snares,
Devised for killing time and cares.
Old days are gone—why make a noise!
1 watch the boats sail up the coast,
My heart goes with the shearer boys ;
I dream of joys that I have lost—
The stirring scenes in shed and pound,
The niggers’ yells, the chaff, the fun,
The grim toil, only fit for men,
And all God’s empty space around;
The air as clear and sweet as love,
The sunlight dancing on the trees;
The night, with myriad stars above,
The only sound the stirring breeze —
I'd have it all again, 1 say,
Could I but shear ten-score a day.

The Stradbrokes have been having a lean
time since landing back from their Centralian
trip. While topping off the jaunt with a
few weeks at Macedon, his Ex. went down
to ’flu, and only struggled back to convales-
cence to be pushed over again. His tem-
perature is noAv ebbing back to normal, but
daughter Helena is reported as suffering
from a severe attack of pleurisy; and accord-
ing to the latest bulletin little Christopher,
the baby of the family, has joined his father
on the 'flu list.
The family’s health permitting, Lady
Stradbroke will be at the Prahran City Hall
on the morning of Oct. 14 to unveil the Gentle-
women’s Aid work-sale. Many an elderly
lady would go without even a scrape of
butter on her crust but for the G.A.S., which
has not made sufficient noise about its doings
to attract the attention it deserves. The
hon. sec., Ethel Flower, spends many hours
each week visiting members whose fingers
have been put out of action by sickness or
old age. One old lady whom she habitually
cheers is within a few years of her hundredth
milestone. Although her hands can no
longer guide her knitting needles, she is
bright and intelligent. Eight; months in bed
has not dimmed her interest in the news of
the day, from the fortunes of the Bruce-
Page pact to the matrimonial intentions of
the Prince of Wales.
Flying officers gave a demonstration of
their organising efficiency with their annual
jazz manoeuvres in the St. Kilda Town Hall
on Friday night. In a firmament of green
festoonery, starred with red and blue lights,
floated all manner of air-craft, from a silver
dirigible to hundreds of bobbing balloons.
Flight-Lieut. Wrigley, who directed the
manoeuvres, calls for mention in despatches.
For the first hour the lights were a shade
too dim for cheerfulness, but at 10 o’clock
they went up and all was well. The frock-
ing, which ranged from the skimpiest of
sheathings to billowy crinolined effects, pro-
vided one or two surprises. One young per-
son had bared a shoulder without even the
subterfuge of an arm-strap. Admiral
Hall Thompson and daughter Valerie were
the guests in chief. General Chauvel’s red
coat twinkled from the jazz floor. He is
an enthusiastic foxtrotter. Wing-Com-
mander Goble brought his wife in cinnamon
brown and an engaging smile. Col. Thomas,
acting Sec. for Defence, understudied De-
fence Minister Bowden, who was at home
with the ’flu.
The Melbourne Repertory triumph, “Dear
Brutus,” for which the Playhouse hoisted
the full-up sign on each of its four nights,
owed more to the attractiveness of its femi-
nine cast than to social boost. The show will
be put on again shortly for two nights, to
help the .Mayor’s fund. Artist George
Bell’s pretty wife, who looks as if she had
stepped out of a Du Maurier drawing, was
Joanna, in a flesh-pink straight-cut _ tunic,
with a red rose tucked in her dark hair, and
she smiled with eoual charm in her second
frock —a floral silk of girlish simplicity.
Maisie Bennett, the disgruntled Mrs.
Dearth, was handsomely gowned in grey
velvet weighted with pastel-colored embroi-
deries, blue and silver leaves binding
her charming head. As Mrs. Purdie Eliza-
beth Woodyatt wore black satin shimmered
over with beads and encircled her shingled
hair with a silver band. Ceridwen Kelly
did the dream child in a short frock of pale-
green and two long plaits. At the end
there was a laurel wreath for producer Hel-
ton Daniells; and the company went off to
a thrilling supper at the Oriental.
An Australian who travelled on the Bercn-
garia to New York with the Prince calls
him the new experiment in perpetual motion.
He almost wore the decks out doing round
after round at a cross-country pace, tiring
out in his morning ramble each of the four
members of his party. In addition be
“exercised” daily for forty minutes and
swam for nearly an hour. After that he
jazzed all the afternoon and evening. One
American special correspondent cabled that,
while most of the men on board had dressed
with a correct stiff front, the Prince arrived
in the ballroom in a pleated shirt, not too
stiffly starched, with ordinary pearl buttons.
But travelling is so educational, he’ll prob-
ably know better from now on.
The 29th Battalion officers produced their
big collection of regimental trophies to rein-
force the decorations at their annual ball in
Collingwood civic hall. Colonel Ulrich, the
battalion commander, was chief conspirator
in launching the shivoo. The scarlet mess-
jackets almost outdazzled the colorful dis-
play of feminine cliiffonery. Many brass-hats
added weight to the gathering; amongst these
were General Jess, Colonels Brinsmead,
Black, Raws. Lorenzo, Farr, Alderson and
Lux ton, all but the last-named with their
wives.
The Ernie Austins brought daughter
Lcnore from their Western District home-
stead to hand her over to Ken Watson, who
claimed her in the Melbourne Grammar
chapel. Lenore blushed sweetly under a
mist of bridal tulle moored to her Titian
head with orange blossoms. The bride-
groom's sister Nora and Joan Chirnside
'maided like twin stanzas of an ode to Spring,
and the Claud Palmers’ small daughter,
Claudia, looked after the bridal train like
a minor lyric. Colin Johnstone, helped by
Roy Cox, best-manned. The bottles were
uncorked in No. 9 Darling-street, where the
gathering was heavy with Western district
wool. Mrs. Austin (she was a MacPherson,
of Neerin Neerin) hostessed in black lace
and georgette and feathered hat, with the
light relief of a bouquet of mauve orchids.
The ’groom’s widowed mother, Mrs. G. D.
Watson, brightened her black outfit with a
posy of pansies and a gold tissue hat.
The George Kettlewells’ second daughter,
Muriel, who tripped to Sydney last month
with mother, has red-lettered the jaunt by
getting engaged to Alan Grant, whose
widowed mother lives at Rose Bay. Only
last year the Kettlewells parted with their
eldest daughter, Gladys, to the Hugh
Strachans’ elder boy, Geoff.
Dr. Frank Tate, eldest hope of the Direc-
tor of Education, was married to Dental-
Colonel Hall’s Valeric last week at the
Toorak Kirk. The bride supported white
and gold brocade draperies, clasped on one
hip with brilliants; there was a tulle tram
weighted with orange blossoms; and more
blossoms coronetted the bridal veil lent by
Mrs. Henry Law, of Singapore. Kathleen
Shaw and Kathleen Tate 'maided in powder-
blue georgette petalled like roses under
black hats. Small Judith Gibson, frocked
in silver lace and swinging a beribboned
cowslip ball, held the bridal train out of
the dust. Guido Wertheim best-manned the
'groom, with the assistance of the latter’s
medical brother Alan. No. 9 Darling-street
sheltered a three-act jollo, opening with a
reception, and ending up as a jazz, with
supper sandwiched between.
Dr. Wilfred Foster, youngest son of the
late Albert Park medico, met the Brighton
medical Skinners’ eldest daughter at the
Albert Park Anglican Church the other day.
The pretty girl, who was led forward by
her Dad, was in gold brocade with a clasp
of brilliants. Her wedding veil, lent by the
Howard Praagst widow, floated over a shim-
mering back-fall of tissue. Sister Clarice
maided like an aurora in misty piuk under
a rosy tulle head-veil, while Harry Foster
helped his brother through. Later there was
a supper-dance in Carlyon’s.
Be introduced to Elizabeth Woodyatt, the
Mount Albert girl who starred in the name-
part of the Repertory School’s recent
production o f
“The Young
Person in
Pi n k,” and
has since been
helping to
brighten the
Repertory ver-
sion of “Dear
Brutus,” at
the Playhouse.
The blonde-
haired Eliza-
beth is not
training in the
Rep.’s nursery
with an eye
to a stage
career: she
does it out of
sheer love of
the work. Her
earliest ap-
pearances be-
hind the ama-
teur footlights were made at the ’Varsity,
where she spent a few years acquiring the
right to attach the letters M.A. to her name.
Lafayette made the picture.
The last year or so has seen a wonderful
boom in motor traffic in Victoria. In 1923
no less than 16,654 new vehicles were regis-
tered, bringing the totals to 44,462 motor-
cars and 15,504 motor-cycles. By the end
of June of this year the cars had increased
to 52,700 and the cycles to 17,100. But it
isn’t all balm in Gilead. The heaviness of
some of the new cars—notably the fleet of
’busses—means a severe strain upon roads
built for much lighter traffic. The smothness
of the motor speedways of St. Kilda-road
was once our pride; now there are so many
depressions that a motor-’bus ride to the
beach is a tooth-loosening experience.
The Alfred Hospital will get the nroceeds
of a ball held in St. Ivilda Tow n Hall by the
Prahran Coliseum. It whirled cheerily to a
decorative backing of blue and gold, Avith
rose-colored light-shades surrounding a
centre-light festooned about with sea-weed
and iridescent shells. Councillors Levi and
Pickford, the civic heads of St. Ivilda and
Prahran, were present with their mayoresses.
A. W. Dunlop had a busy time as chairman
of the ball committee, which had Hilda
McLean and R. A. Jordan as secretaries.
A famous actor once swore he would
rather face a dozen first nights than the
awful intimacy of a single drawing-room
performance, but Beatrice Ternan succeeded
in her Hawthorn parlor the other afternoon
in passing scathless through such an ordeal.
The youthful recitress weighted her lighter
elocutionai-y fare with a fine interpretation
of Browning’s “Andrea del Sarto,” contriv-
ing with her rich inflections to keep the voice
of Andrea from getting tangled up with that
of his beloved. The afternoon was agree-
ably postscripted with tea and cake, which
Beatrice dispensed to her guests with the
graceful composure that keeps her from tear-
ing an elocutionary passion to tatters.
Ruskin snapped this picture of William
Brady, the Western District boy with the
remarkable tenor voice, who, disguised as
Nanki Poo,
appeared in a
recent amateur
performance of
“The Mikado.”
It was the
sixth show in
which he has
starred as
juevenile lead,
besides warb-
ling in various
charitable
causes. Young
William has
just sighted
hi s twenty-
first milestone;
he earns his
crust in a Mel-
bourne busi-
ness house,
but hopes
—a n d his
trainer, Theo-
philus Roberts, hopes too —that one day his
voice, whose silvery sweetness is richly
freighted with dramatic force, will carry him
across the opera footlights. Port Fairy is
his native heath; his grandfather—or was
it his great-grandfather?—was one of the
first white men to land on that rugged coast.
Prince Alexis Obolensky, the singer who
came to Australia in the train of _ Dame
Nellie, broke his distinguished nose in two
places in a fall on board the boat that was
taking him back to Gay Paree. Friends,
however, may dry their tears, for the ship s
surgeon, in mending the double fracture,
made the nose look more distinguished than
ever.
Already there has been counting of noses,
and the very satisfactory Brunton is prac-
tically certain to be re-elected Melbourne s
Mayor for another year.
In order to satisfy Adelaide’s unexpected
appetite for Grand Opera, Melba has for the
third time applied the “move on” clause to
her Limbless Soldiers’ Appeal performance.
This has now been re-dated for the
thirteenth. The change will upset a lot of
people, but it will allow both sections of
vice-royalty to farewell the Dame.
The G. D. Fairbairn couple, of Mathoura-
road, Toorak, had a musical tea-party to
re-introduce Mabel Dowrn, one of Melbourne’s
most promising composers. The rooms were
gay with yellow poppies and feathery grasses,
which provided a cheery backing for the
hostess’s well-cut magpie frock. The musical
menu, warbled sweetly by Nellie Cameron
and Louie Webb, was chiefly compiled from
the star guest’s charming compositions.
Charles Fairbairn’s younger daughter, the
auburn-haired Betty, who has been acquiring
a final polish across seas, under the wing of
sister Esther Wheatley, lands back on Oct.
20. Ten days later she will have her bud-
ding as a grown-up at a ball, hostessed by
her two sisters-in-law, the John and Jim
Fairbairn matrons, at the St. Ivilda Town
Hall.
Harold Dalton, third son of the W. A.
Daltons, of Ballarat, has persuaded Margaret
Bakhap to make him happy. Margaret is
the elder daughter of the late Tasmanian
Senator and of his widow, who shelters with
her daughters in Grey-street, St. Ivilda.
Betty Anderson, eldest daughter of the
R. W. Andersons, of Miradoo, Corowa
(N.S.W.), has promised to make the Rut-
ter Clarkes’ second son, Ken, happy. Ken
was captain of Melbourne Grammar before
he went to the war.
The other day the State Ministry asked
the politicians in for a tour of inspection
of Hobart’s untenanted and over-large vice-
regal residence. Speaker Jack Evans, who
is just off the sick-list, created a diversion,
as the party navigated the star bedroom, by
stretching himself on the vice-regal couch,
which beckoned invitingly, while brother
members covered him with pillows. From
the downy fastness came a sleepy murmur,
“The Speaker retires.” The object of the
visit was to discover the possibilities of con-
verting the hallow-ed building into a State
Parliamentary shelter. The undemocratic
section snorts at the blasphemous suggestion,
but comforts itself that the Uppah Cham-
bah will block the unorthodox measure. An-
other suggestion is to pass the premises over
to the University.
The new pastor of the Collins-street Bap-
tist flock —the tabernacle has been renowned
for its preachers—arrived from England a
few days ago. W. D. Jackson is his name,
and he comes with an astonishing war and
sport record. He enlisted as a private in the
artillery in 1914. rose to the rank of captain,
was twice mentioned in despatches, and was
awarded the Italian Croix de Guerre for con-
spicuous gallantry. In first-class football
he once kicked 40 goals in a season, he plays
tennis, is a keen golfer, is in the very early
thirties and starts life here with a wife and
baby son.
Members of the Vic. branch of the C.M.S.
are shaking hands with themselves on
account of a windfall of nearly £27,000, left
by Nicholas John Raven, formerly of Gee-
loi\g, who died lately in Birmingham, where
his home had been for the past 40 years.
His father was one of the pioneers of Gee-
long, and obtained a grant of land from the
Government, on which he built the family
home, which is still known as Ravenswood.
Nicholas John was one of the early boys of
Geelong Grammar, and one of the founders
of the Barwon Rowing Club. All his life
he had been keenly interested in Church
work, particularly in relation to missionary
enterprise. His bequest has lifted a load
from the “heads” of the society hei’e, and set
it firmly on its feet.
Contributions to the Children’s Hospital
Auxiliary Workers Fund total £2200, which
is just two hundred more than last year’s
little lot. The four-months-old canteen has
proved a success, and hon. sec. Miss Guthrie,
at a recent meeting of branches, threw a
verbal bouquet to the Trades Hall for its
very practical help.
Adelaide’s social synopsis :
Life moves to Gi-and Opera motifs, with inter-
ludes of Hunt Club Races or a bridge party to raise
cash for one or other of bur hard-pressed charities.
For the Races, a. day of alternate sun and rain
divided frocking between new Spring bravery and
tailor-mades, with black marocain or alpaca satin
as the happiest compromise. Lady Bridges was in
rust-color, with fur at her throat, and brought with
her a small navy-blue daughter.
The Children’s Hospital Extension Fund is to get
the proceeds from a concert given by the Thousand
Voices’ Choir —an excellent show that even tempted
Lady Bridges away from Grand Opera.
Many an Old Girl is mourning Miss Catherine
Thomber, whose girls’ school at Unley Park was
the seminary for j'oung ladies a generation ago, and
whose strenuous years of teaching did not prevent
her living happily to the redoubtable age of 86.
Mrs. Flanders, best known here as Hilda Felstead,
was a hard worker in the Liberal cause before
matrimony took her to India, and the other after-
noon she was feted by her one-time fellow-members
of the Unley Women’s Branch of the Liberal Fede-
ration. Reminiscences and musical monologues by
the guest of the day added a savour to the tea-
drinking.
On Friday dancers divided themselves between a
fancy dress ball in the Walkerville Hall, with funds
for St. Andrew’s school as its objective, and a frivol
at the Palais Royal that was part of the money-
raising scheme for the General Hospital fund.
For the rest Adelaide has been laying
its homage and the contents of its gar-
dens at the feet of Melba. The co. was
tea-ed by the Mayoress in her rooms one
afternoon (’twas the night of “Bohgme,” so there
was no Melba), with city councillors and their femi-
nine belongings and a sprinkling of mere civilians
to meet them, and a word or two of welcome from
Dr. Harold Davies.
Adelaide is planning many new statues and other
memorials. The figure of late Chief Justice Way is
being placed in position outside the University, of
which he was Chancellor. A site for the Light
Horse memorial has been pegged out opposite the
Botanic Gardens gate. The designs for two others
were received last week. The Ross’ Smith memorial
will be near the Cathedral, but the designs are to be
held over to give sculptors elsewhere a chance to
compete. The State’s own War Memorial is to en-
croach on the south-west corner of Government House
grounds; the designs sent in are being judged by
Vaughan (Commonwealth Bank), Simpson (Architect-
in-Chief) and Jackson (Institute of Architects).
More news* has reached Sydney about the
divorce of the Gowen couple—she sued on
the ground of neglect. After having a man
under your hand for months and months on
a 98t't. yacht, of course, you are going to
feel neglected if the poor thing, on reaching
the home town, scoots off for an hour or two
with the lads. Tho couple of the Speejacks
were entertained pretty widely in Sydney.
He talked cement roads at the Millions Club
(his father is a Cement King), and she
looked temperamental, wore droopy millinery
and favored mauve. One afternoon they
failed to turn up at a party arranged by a
Sydney Club in their honor. The hosts got
worried and began to think their guests
must have lost their way. Finally one of
the men jumped into a launch and made for
the Speejacks. The Gowens were indulging
in a siesta. Oh yes, they had remembered
the party, but they found it too liaht!

A WOMAN'S
LETTER
SAY-
Kayser
SILK
STOCKINGS
Randwick was like a mess of pottage on
Saturday when the Spring Meeting opened
in a thick, warm drizzle. There was an
absence of the Summer frock; the dressing
generally had that changed-at-the-last-
rninute look, and the wise virgin wore her
umbrella on her wrist. Hats were wide,
small, picture or postillion-like. Of these
last Keith Smith’s lady wore the nobbiest,
plus a severely smart black and white satin
which carried the last touch of Mayfair—
the gardenia on its lapel. Gardenias
bloomed everywhere—in hats and costumes
and on wristlets; most of them white, with
an occasional red shining through the murk.
Black and white and white and black almost
entirely clothed the stands, for woman is
very sheep-like; -any visiting foreigner must
have got the impression that we were in
lialf-mourning for some national misfortune.
Those who weren’t in black and white stuck
to the indeterminate beige or a fascinating
onion-bi-own. Pianist Francis de Bour-
gignon says he knows a composer in Paris
who made a song out of a seed-merchant’s
catalogue. But there was one girl on Satur-
day who made a nature poem out of onion-
brown silk alpaca topped by a wide red-
currant crin. hat, the both propelled by
snake-skin shoes.
Of all the stands the most over-crowded
was the official. When the race was on-
each seat was packed sardine-tight, and
each step was made to supply seating accom-
modation for three. Seat-snatchers were on
every side, and if you moved for a second
to greet a friend you turned back to find your
claim jumped. After a race courtly gentle-
men took short cuts by stepping from seat
to seat, leaving a trail of damp footprints
in their wake. The Government House
party was the happiest. They could go off
and mooch about and come back to their
little pen like lambs to the fold. His Ex.
turned on, if possible, a jollier smile, but
his garments manifested none of the lyric
glory of Spring. His lady draped herself
in the purple of pansies cunningly inter-
woven with green, while her feathered hat
was of the same patrician hue. The Claude
Macdonalds, of Wantabadgery, who are their
race guests, were of the group, she in a
black lace frock and hat, with a marvel-
lously embroidered coat to keep out the
weather.
Two smart Melbourne visitors were the
Rupert Boyd and Harry Rosenthal matrons.
Mary Hughes was one of the afternoon’s
attractions: it may have been her hat, or it
may have been her smile. Another of the
clan, by marriage, Mrs. Dan Kelly, turned a
peach-bloom cheek to the unkind day from
under a flame-feather toque. Another toque-
wearer was Mrs. Jimmie Burns; hers was
of silver tissue worn above the übiquitous
black. Mrs. Steenie Osborne, one of the
week’s hostesses, wore black and white
tailorings and a small black hat, with
fashion’s second favorite, sealing-wax red,
upon it. Mrs. Tony Hordern and Mrs.
Dudley Gibson were others whose frocks
were sombre and tubular. One of the
prettiest lines of Spring goods was dis-
played by the young Harry Turle matron ;
her frock was honey-colored georgettes and
rows of cream lace, finished off with a delect-
able cream lace hat. Ear-rings, heavy as
cenotaphs, were the feature, of Mrs. A. E.
Hughes’s frocking. But the joy of the
afternoon was the middle-aged loyalist who,
allegedly in imitation of the King at his last
garden party, wore trousers creased down
the sides.
A dance at the Golf Club rounded off the
day for the social elect; others, not realising
the blight under which they labored, made
the Australia, the Ambassadors and the
Wentworth ring with their mirth.
In Monday’s unexpected sunshine Rand-
wick bloomed with color, and black and
white gave place to more smiling raiment.
The vice-reine wore' her lime and ludo suit,
and smiled under the upturned brim of a
lime-colored hat. Commander Grant’s wife,
very demure in Quaker grey, was of the
party.
A Chief Justice is not to be trifled with,
so the pall of rain that had obscured Sydney
for three days and three nights was pushed
aside by the celestial scene-shifters, and an
awning of blue sky roofed over the Cullens’
garden party. Still an icy wind blew, and
the only wonder was that the hostess wasn’t
frozen solid as she and her knight stood at
their post within the gates during the long,
long handshake. The hostess was frocked
according to the last edict from Paris, and
was a slim study in black and white. All
the guests were Upper Crust, as the gather-
ing had been summoned to meet a double
brace of Excellencies —the G.-G.’s and the
home-grown. Lady Forster flaunted sky-
after-raiu blues in tailor-made and millinery,
and her State Ex.’s lime-toned costume
sported a ludo-like design at the cuffs and
collar. Admiral Hall Thompson’s wife kept
her black georgettes warm with lush furs.
The Premier’s lady tucked her black-and-
white finery under a musquash coat, and
daughter Gwen added the same rider to sheer
white frocking. The rest of the frocking
suggested security in the bank, if not always
trust in the Heavens. Commander Grant,
who aided the Governor, brought his pink-
clieeked wife. She was one of the few whose
complexion emerged triumphant from the
teeth of the gale. Law and Order, the
Church, the Army and the Navy disported
themselves up and down the green aisles
and lawns of Tregoyd, as _ far as tall hats
and a proper sense of dignity would permit.
Archbishop Kelly’s robes threw the petunias
into a fit of envy; and Frederick Waley’s
lady wore a rope of pearls, the making of
which must have caused several beds of
oysters sleepless nights.
A big roll of notes to keep the doors of
Furlough House ajar for the wives and
kiddies of soldiers will come from the dance
at the Ambassadors the other night. The
vice-regals dropped in about nine with their
guests, the Claude Macdonalds. Lady de
Chair’s beautiful black frock was of the
draped sisterhood, bursting into a side cas-
cade of jade-green ostrich feather that flowed
from a source of Rhinestones. A jade
coronet and ropes of pearls were further
embellishments. The Chief Justice Cullens,
the Premier Fullers and pretty Mrs. Wil-
kinson gave the salaam of welcome to their
Exes., while a baby McMurdo girl in blue
muslin handed over an armful of pink roses.
Mrs. Claude Macdonald wore luscious pale-
gold brocades filmed over by a cobwebby
lace cape.
At one of the overflowing musters of the
Friendly Sailors’ Wives' in the Royal Naval
House the other afternoon, the Governor-
General’s lady, in something new and some-
thing blue, was the principal guest. Mrs.
Craufurd, assisted more or less by small
daughter Deidre, was in charge of the
quarter-deck, and with her were Mrs. George
Vivers and Admiral. Hall-Thompson’s lady.
The new Mrs. Soutter —she was Belle Gar-
land—turned up, and a new light was turned
on the gathering by Commander Pullen’s
just-arrived-from-England wife. She’s a sis-
ter, by the way, of that Captain Calder-
Wood who was so popular that no party
was happy without him during the few
months he spent in Sydney.
To-morrow (Friday) will be Rose Day,
and any threepenny bits you feel like throw-
inf away will do the United Charities good
if you aim them at the collection-boxes.
Here is the latest picture of writing-girl
Isabel Ramsay, the news of whose marriage
in Paris to
Dr. Rodolfo
Foa was broad-
casted theother
night. Isabel’s
father was
capable John
Ramsay, of the
Hansard
staff; from him
she inherited
the gift of
tongues that
was such a
help to her in
her journalistic
work on the
Continent. The
doctor has got
an a c c o rn-
plished as well
as a good-
looking wife,
for Isabel is a
brilliant pian-
ist and something of a singer. He, Mrs.
Ramsay, who has just returned from Paris,
says, is a handsome man with the air of
an old grandee. He is a Doctor of Letters,
and his job is diplomacy.
At a conservative estimate, Mrs. Donald
Esplin and Miss Rhodes reclfou the North
Shore Grammar fete will net £l3OO. Not
bad for one afternoon’s takings. Mrs. Es-
plin lays the blame on the kick-off given to
the first committee meeting by Lady de Chair
and to Tutankhamen. The royal mummy
lay in an ornate tent heavy with incense.
He answered whatever questions the seeker
might ask—for a consideration. The ques-
tioner was alone in the tent with the mummy.
But alas for human credulity! The gentle-
man of old Nile was fitted with a dictaphone
in his tummy; this was connected to the.ear
of a live gent, in the next tent, and he made
the replies by means of a transmitter in
Tut-Tut’s mouth.
The ball for the Navy League’s sea cadets
took all the best limousines out to the Palais
last "week. The dance differed little from
other functions of the kind —except that
Olive Kelso King cheered it by appearing in
a Deauville bathing-suit, which is a “bathers”
with skirts an’ stockings an’ shoes an’ every-
thing. Mrs. Venour Nathan, who is the
greatest living exponent of Euclid’s straight
line, dressed her length without breadth in
billowy skirts of blue-and-gold shot taffetas
tomied by a long bodice of gold lace. Later
on the indefatigable lady camouflaged her-
self as a senora and danced a tango with a
disguised as Don Carlos. Howard
Vernon’s widow suggested a blue sky trail-
ing fleecy clouds ; Moira Brady in mauve and
Mimi Healy in ivory georgettes were effec-
tive f rockers: and Margot Phillips wore a
smooth dark head above a mass of cyclamen

the good-looking Governor-General couple,
Her Ex. radiant in black and gold. With
them came the Chief-Justice Cullens, she in
glittering black satin and jet.

A born de-
corative artist,
with strong
dramatic lean-
ings, he pro-
duced the
queer, clever
effects for
Duncan Mac-
douga 1 1 ’ s
“Masses and
Man,” and he
has designed
the costumes
and mediaeval
effects for the
miracle plays,
“Ever yman”
and “The Deluge,” which, under the direct-
ing eye of Eleanor Ross and the organising
hand of Professor Muscio’s wife, will be
produced at the Con. to-morrow (Friday)
evening. The gate-money goes to the Cros-
by Hall Endowment Fund.
Artist-architect John D. Moore and Doro-
thy Morton chose race week for their entry
for. the Stakes. The handicap started at St.
Andrew’s, Wahroonga, with Archdeacon
D’Arcy Irvine and Padre Stephen Taylor as
stewards. John’s picture, “Contrasts,” in
the Society of Artists’ show, was bought by
the Melbourne Art Gallery, and that was
the second-best pre-nuptial party; the best
was staged by the council of the society at
the Horseshoe.
There was a real heather mixture at St.
Stephen’s last week when Dr. Chisholm
Ross’s second daughter, Margaret, was
linked up to Will Peters, of Ashfield. by
Padre Calder. Chisholm Ross handed over
his sonsy lass, who brought ivory chiffon
velvets, tulle veiling and a white heather
bouquet to the kirk. Four bridesmaids and
two tiny trainbearers attended the bride,
while the ’groom’s seconds included one b n st
man and three groomsmen. Coffee and bombs
were afterwards served in Market-street
Sargent’s.
Dr. Edith Allard made a w r ise choice when
she dropped the handkerchief to Harold
Beale. Harold belongs to the O. C. Beale
piano firm, and the very nature of his work
must have swathed him with gentleness and
predisposed him to harmony. Anyway, they
took a chance last week, and started their
symphony in St. Philip’s under the baton
of Padre Wade, of Killara. The bride, who
is a Wahroonga bud. trailed the glory of
ivory marocains, the drapings thereof
clutched by a diamond buckle, while the
silver-tissue train was built on a rosy foun-
dation, and edged with pink ostrich feather.
A Brussels lace veil and an armful of orchids
were other trifles the bride had flung upon
her as she hasted to the wedding. Four
bridesmaids looked like choice confectionery
in pale pink and baby-blue chiffons, Nor-
man Lawrence best-manned, and the wed-
ding meats were tested at the "Wentworth
by a large assembly of friends and relations.
Hunter Freeman, of the scientific staff
of the C.S.R.. has just returned from Hono-
lulu, where he has been attending the Pan-
Anglican Food Conference, to find to his
great joy that Thea Day has agreed to super-
vise his domestic affairs. Thea’s father
recently retired from the management of the
Commercial Bank at Molong. The young
man in the case was first a brilliant Aus-
tralian scholar, then a good Digger, and later
a student of Agriculture in France. In less
than two years he had gained high honors
there—something of a feat, as he was study-
ing in a foreign tongue.
Little Jimmie Malone, the Vagabonds’ last
protege, didn’t live long to enjoy the
plenty the large-hearted players had con-
jured for him. It will be remembered that
they made £l6O ,for Jimmie by one produc-
tion of “Her Husband’s Wife.” Part of this
went to buy the small invalid a chair:
another part went to buy him a radio set.
The rest was to make'his days rosy for
weeks ahead. After only a week's listening-
in at the big throbbing world, Jimmie listened-
in to the universal summons. The remnant
of the fund goes to help his mother..
Clever singing and acting girl Dorrie Ward
has been very sick for some months; and
now she, who has countless times helped to
fill a purse for charitable institutions, is
being paid the pretty compliment by fellow-
amateurs of having a “testimonial” orga-
nised in her honor. Their State Excellencies,
the Chief Justice Cullens and Granville
Eyrie have given it their blessing: the Cheer-
oh Girls and the Mosman Musical Society
(to both of these Dorrie has given great
support) are doing the organising; the Aus-
tralian Picture Theatre (Spit-road Junction)
is the place, and November 12 the date.
Enid Conley last, week gave Sydney audi-
ences their second chance since her return
from London to quaff her music. She has
a wide, laughing face, and wears her hair
in a straight fringe above the imaginative
and humorous eyes. Little more than a
youngster, she played a programme that
would have gained a visiting artist a civic
reception and a forest of laurels. Berta
Carr, billed as a Russian mezzo, sang as well
as if she’d been home-grown. She is a fair-
haired bundle of cleverness, who swept
through the London Royal College of Music
on the wings of three successive scholarships.
Dorothy Davies was the accompanist. Later
on in the week Enid was the exponent at
Arundel Orchard’s meat-full music lecture
at the Royal Colonial Institute.
Brisbane’s addenda:—
Sir Matthew barracked for our native flora at the
Field Naturalists’ Wild Flower Show the other day.
He rejoiced to see that the flowers exhibited, except
for a brumby or two, were definitely Australian,
whereas at another show he had seen that day they
were all imported. In herbage flowers Queensland
could not, perhaps, compete with Westralia, yet
his Ex. spoke of our out-west plains azure and
snow-white and golden and purple and scarlet with
wild blossomings.
To commemorate old Brisbane’s hundred years, the
Cumbrae Stewarts gathered members of the Historical
Society and others, at the Brisbane Women’s Club,
amid larkspur, gum tips and gladioli. Edith David-
scn, the Gillies girls, Mildred Bell and Mrs. Mel
Georgeson saw to the musical part. Mrs. Cumbrae
Stewart, in navy morocain with opalescent sequins,
gave the glad hand to the guests.
Sir Matthew-, with George and Pamela Nathan, went
to the Nurses’ Ball in the South Brisbane City Hall.
Palms and ropes of green stuffs had transformed the
ballroom, the electric lights wore yellow skirts, and
Iceland poppies twinkled in the supper room.
A horde of Judges laid aside their wigs and frowns
and dined with the law students at the Daniell.
G. H. Mocatta presided, and there was much debate
in humorous strain. A. D. Graham proposed the
association.
To aid the Seamen’s Institute the world jazzed at
the Hillcoats’ home, Teneriffe House. Asparagus
fern was latticed overhead, and bright balloons bobbed
gaily. Emmie Stew-art’s orchestra pla3-ed, and supper
invaded the billiard and dining rooms.
The Bellevue was done up for a dance to aid the
Frsuline College. There was a big roll up, including
the Theodores, Mrs. Tom Ryan, the Dr. Duhigs, the
11. J. Windsors and Wilsons.
There was a big military wedding in St. Paul's,
Ipswich, when A. St. John Heard tied the knot
betwixt Marjorie Hall, L.T.C.L., and Percival Savage,
D.S.O. The bride, w-ho is daughter of Major and
Mrs. T. F. Hall, is champion of Ipswich tennis
players, and the bridegroom w-as one of the first
Queenslanders to enlist;, Lieut. Keith Hall was best
man, and Lieuts. Harris and Mocatta groomsmen. Una
Symes, Marion Morrison and Joyce Hall bridesmaided.
A guard of honor was formed by the bridegroom's
cobbers. Whitehouse’s Cafe, decked in the colors of
the bridegroom’s battalion, saw the reception to over
a hundred. A tiny tennis championship cup decorated
the wedding cake. A motor tour to Sydney and
the South Coast is the honeymoon outing.
The Canon Pughs, from England, are at Mont-
pelier. She was a Brodribb, daughter of the Silver
King.
Connie Clowes gave a tea to honor bride-elect
Marian Ewan at the Pines, red pnd orange Iceland
poppies being presented to the principal guest.
The sailing season opened this week, the Beaver
acting as flagship for the R.Q.Y.C. A band and after-
noon tea engaged the guests’ attention between races.
The Queensland Art Society gave a party for
Gladys Owen at the National.
Mignon Little, who is going to marry Jack Tindall,
son of the late Captain Bream Tindall, gleaned a
silver tea and coffee service from the Marine and
Harbors Department.. Portmaster Captain Forrester
made the presentation.
Queensland pianist Erick John has been before
the public eye in his home State recently, with
violinist H. Scott McCallum, once an actor. In a
recital they are to have the assistance of another
Brisbaneite, Verna Morcom, w-ho achieved a London
reputation.
Ambulance patients outback are likely to find the
aeroplane invaluable. The other day Mrs. Percy
Bowman, of Waverley station, near Windorah, was
brought in 120 miles by car to Jundah. Ordered
thence to a Longreach hospital, she was conveyed
the remaining 125 miles by ’plane. The machine was
sent from Longreach; it took an hour and’ a half
on the trip out, but the return journey was made in
an hour and five minutes. Rain had made the
roads impassable.

Under a sky heavy with rain-clouds, from
which sluggish drops were falling on the just and
unjust, three very tired colts struggled past the
judge’s box at Randwick almost in line. Then
78,000 pairs of eyes saw No. 2 go up—Heroic had
won the £BOOO A.J.C. Derby for Melbourne and J.
R. Corteen. There has rarely been a more' exciting
lace for the Blue Riband. Heroic, fractious at
the barrier as usual, got away two lengths behind
the bunch, but, to counterbalance this, Nigger
Minstrel was knocked on the rail by Solidify, who
came in a bit, before they had gone a hundred yards.
Then Maher, on the 50-to-l chance, Sir Dighloek,
shot to the front, and at the mile post his mount
was a dozen lengths in the lead. Over the next
turlong he gained another eight or ten lengths. At
the half mile post he was still 15 lengths ahead.
But between that point and the home turn, Heroic
and Solidify, with Nigger Minstrel and Spearfelt
following, made up a lot of ground, and those who
had shouted “They’ll never catch him” began to
change their tune. His tail swishing ominously,
Sir Dighloek led into the straight, but Heroic soon
caught him, Solidify dropping back to the rear, and
took the inside position. He was immediately
challenged by Nigger Minstrel, in the centre, and
Spearfelt, on the outside, and for 13 or 14 thrilling
seconds there were only inches between them, but
Cairns rode a vigorous finish and got his game chestnut
home a neck ahead of Nigger Minstrel, who was
the same distance in front of Spearfelt. Sir Dighloek
headed the others, but was a long way back. Time,
2min. 34see.
Young had a comfortable ride on Blackadder in
the Epsom. Chirnside’s horse was always favorite,
but there was more money for Trimacre on the course
—the Rosehill-trained mare, who was ridden by
Toohey, was backed from 10’s to 5’s —and Cliffdale,
a strong Newcastle tip, was never shorter than B’s.
Duke Isinglass, Cistercian, Farceur, Valdoona and
Julia Grey also had friends at double-figure quota-
tions. The Maoriland jockey, who has ridden some
poor races in Sydney but was in excellent form
on Saturday, got Blackadder well away and was
content to let Braehead and The Monk make the
running. Fourth into the straight, behind The
Monk, Braehead and Duke Isinglass, the favorite
ran up to the leaders at the distance and, without
being extended, won by a length and a half from
honest All Home (33 to 1), who finished faster than any-
thing else, and would have been a fair thing
with Blackadder away. Trimacre was a good third,
The Monk a meritorious fourth, and Cliffdale next.
The last-named was the unlucky horse of the race,
since he was badly kicked at the barrier, but he
could not have beaten Blackadder as the race was
run. The winner, who galloped the mile in Imin.
38sec., was delivered at the post in perfect con-
dition by Ike Foulsliam, now a veteran and one
of the “characters” of the profession; and the
Whittier people must be accounted very lucky that
he went wrong before the Doncaster.
Young was on Gloaming in the Spring Stakes, and
despite his recent failures and his nine years, punters
preferred The Welkin’s best son to either Ballymena
or Rivoli. Their judgment was vindicated, for
Ballymena, oddly enough, failed to stay, and Rivoli
showed no dash at all, whereas the old champion,
after trailing David for a mile and a quarter, passed
him without difficulty, and ran home a length and
a half ahead of Otway Falkiner’s stallion, who was
well clear of Ballymena. A great cheer went up
when Gloaming was seen to have the measure of
his field, and the cheering was renewed when
Young rode back to weigh in. For the marvellous
old horse had won his 50th race and established an
Australasian stake-money record of £37,058 —£167
more than Eurythmic’s total.
Sea Risk (3’s), who beat Irish Rhythm and Master
Cagou in the Squatters’ Handicap, was the fourth
favorite to arrive; and the other two winners—
Troubadour and The Wild Goose —were second
favorites. Still, McSbortodds didn’t have nearly so
bad a day as has been alleged. He laid such cramped
prices, and there were so many horses backed, that
he might easily have shown a profit on the day’s
transactions, unless he punted with his head down
or had a bad ante-post book. Heroic, who was
10 to 9 in the ring, paid even money on the grand-
stand Tote —a place machine from which IS p.c. and
fractions of sixpences are deducted. Blackadder
closed at 9 to 4 with the bookmakers (many punters
took 2 to 1) and returned £1 11s. for 10s. on the
machine. On big days at Randwick the small
punter is robbed in cold blood. If the club provided
a straightout 10s. Tote that wouldn’t—or needn't
—happen.
Although David had shown a glimpse of form in
the Spring .Stakes—the first for 12 months—-he was
labelled an unlikely starter in the Metropolitan on
Monday. However, the stable changed its mind
when it learned that Tommy O’Bryan—a strong boy
who doesn’t get much riding nowadays—was avail-
able, and had no reason to regret it. In O’Bryan's
hands, Wakeful’s grandson made a great effort to go
one better than his second to Sir Andrew in 1923.
Notwithstanding his 9st. 81b. (he had 51b. more last
year), he was never further back than third, and
when he headed the pacemaking Gold Cap, a 100-
to-1 chance, in the straight it looked as if he would
do it. But Poiyeletan, Prince Woorak and. the West-
ralian Feathernest threw out strong challenges, and
at the end of a thrilling struggle Poiyeletan had
his head in front of the rejuvenated topweight, with
Prince Woorak in tin 1 place and Feathernest
—who, with a little mo: ; seasoning, would probably
have won- —a very close fourth. Poiyeletan, who
was ridden by Farthing, the best of the present crop
of apprentices, left the 3 3 furlongs behind in 2min.
46:}sec. Prepared by D. Lewis, who trains All
Home, for G. Clark and J. Quilty, he has been very
successful this year, and was backed down to 7 to 1.
Prince Charles was favorite at 3’s (5 to 2 in places)
and El Dorado next in demand at 4’s, but neither
was ever prominent, and Irish Rhythm, the fourth
favorite, was done with a long way from home.

The V.R.C. October meeting, held at Caul-
field because alterations are in progress at Fleming-
ton, was conspicuous chiefly for Whittier’s fine win,
at 5 to 4, in the w.f.a. October Stakes, 9 furlongs,
and Lilypond’s good second to him. The pair had
the race to themselves most of the way, and the
Woorak horse finished two lengths in front of the
Westralian chestnut, who carried 51b. more than
his Cup weight—Bst. 61b. Behind the Groper were
Englefield, The Hawk (both well backed), Wynette,
Stand By, Drongo,
Frances Tressady, Har-
vest King and other
classy ones, so It was
an excellent Cup trial
on the Jarrahlander s
part. Suomi (5 to 2)
pleased his Caulfield
Cup supporters by the
manner in which he
galloped the last of
nine furlongs in the
Stand Handicap; well
back at the turn, lie
got up in time to pip
Stare on the pest-
Stare was ridden by
an apprentice, who re-
ceived a 71b. allow-
ance, and might have
done better with a
stronger boy.
FRED WILLIAMS,

Randwick trainers.
Another rousing Derby finish was wit-
nessed at Morphettville (S.A.) on Saturday, when
\\ ycherley, the favorite, won by half a head from
the Buckwheat colt Ble Noir, with Artamus, one of
the Lanins breed, only a head away. Wycherley,
previously a maiden, is a Melbourne colt by Comedy
King—Lace Front. He is trained by Scobiel for V.
V. Moggs, who gave 1050 guineas for him as a year-
ling, and was ridden by A. R. Cooper.
“H. Hardupp” : Bill Sorley was a popular
feature of a recent rough-riding show in Melbourne.
Bill’s white hair and moustache give the impression
that he is much older than his 57 years, and his gaunt,
tall figure appears to lack the suppleness necessary
to the control of equine earthquakes; so there was
a note of sympathy in the applause that he got at
first —a suggestion of reverence for pluck in the aged.
When the old man stayed on a mass of horseflesh
which rooted, bucked, and plunged in the effort to get
rid of him, the sounds of reverence changed to full-
throated cheers of appreciation. Decades have rolled
by since Bill started to show the multitudes how to
ride rough ’uns, and he may go on doing it till the
figures of his age are reversed and he is 75. One
of his experiences was with a sportive young man
who, as Sorley was preparing to enter the stockade,
dashed out of the audience and tried to prevent him.
“Hey, gran’dad,” said the irreverent youth, who was
strong and smelt of beer, “ ’aven’t ver got a grandson
or son who’ll keep you away from this sort of thing?
If y’ ’aven’t, I will. It ’ud be kinder t’ ’and y’
a welt on the jaw that’d rock yer to sleep than
let you go in and break your flamin’ neck.” And
old Bill would have taken that on, too, if the by-
standers had not rushed in to separate them.
Gene Fernandez, styled a Spaniard by the
press-agent, can do everything in the ring but box.
The most, interesting feature of his fight with Bert
Ristuecia at the Melbourne Stadium was the
attempt of one of his seconds to make the small
audience understand that Gene scaled nine stun one
an’ a ’arf, and not nine stun two an’ a ’arf, as
announced. The argument was so one-sided that in
the second round the cry of “Stop it!” was heard,
but it went on for ten gory stanzas before the
Australian was given the referee’s decision. Bert’s
agreeable features were unmarred, by the conflict,
although in every canto he was painted with
blood from the much-bashed descendant of the hi-
dalgoes; even the referee’s hands, as he tore the
combatants apart from the much too frequent clinches,
got stained with gore. Somebody earl}’ called Fer-
nandez “Toreador”; actually he was more like the
bull, making blundering rushes which merely con-
tributed to his undoing. Altogether a distressing
affair.
* * * *
Ernie Rice, the English boxer, who is
alleged to have beaten Ritchie Alitehell, was knocked
out in one round by Harry Casey, the leathery
Queenslander, at the Sydney Stadium. The referee
was undoubtedly hasty with the count, as only eight
seconds of the round remained when Rice struck the
fioor; but the Englishman was getting groggier all
the time he was down, and he probably would not
have come up for the next session, anyhow.
“P’ McKay M.”: By defeating Trinity in
the final of the Melbourne Uni. inter-collegiate tennis,
Newman destroyed the continuity of a record of
unbroken success. Trinity, captained by the inter-
state player C. H. Fitts, had not suffered a reverse
since 1918. Newman were fortunate in being able
to put their 1923 team on the courts unimpaired in
strength, whereas the ioss of Fitts and Hallowes, the
’Varsity Blue, weakened the Trinity four considerably.
The earlier rounds were well fought out, Queen’s and
Ormond going down before the finalists. The out-
standing figures in the concluding matches were
Meares, of Newman, who pushed J. B. Turner to
7—9, 4 —6, and the latter player, who is under-21
champion of Victoria. Bruce Hunt won a rubber for
Trinity in the singles, and Turner, partnered by
T. O. Ewing, captured a match in the doubles. New-
man got the rest, finishing s—ll—-98<5 —11—-98< to 3-—B—-82.
Their victory makes the youngest of the colleges cock
of the walk for the year, with two championships out
ol five to their credit.

loung players were prominent in Sydney
premiership cricket on Saturday. A. Vincent, a
recruit with North Sydney, made an excellent 197 v
Petersham; with W. F. Brown (102) he put on 157
tor the fifth wicket. A right-hander, who hits hard,
he_ should be heard of again. G. Rolleston, a Sydney
left-hander, helped his side to defeat the strong
Gordon team by contributing 103 (out of 212).
Other left-handers to the fore were Warren Bardsley
(84), the patient Mullarky (75) and Jack Gregory
(SS). Charlie Kcllewa.y got the best bowling average
~-7 for 83 for Gordon v. Sydney. It never takes
Kelleway long to strike form.
* * * *
The wickets were tricky in Melbourne on
Saturday, heavy rain having fallen in the morning,
and teams that had first knock hurriedly closed their
batting (if it had not already been closed by the
opposing bowlers) in time to let their opponents
have a hand. The procedure was unprofitable in the
case of Collingwood (s for 97, declared), for Cohen
(a 4 n. 0.) and fonsford (43) got going, and St. Kiida’s
tally was 2 for 13 8 at stumps; but in the other
games it paid. Generally speaking, the batting was
deplorable, but that is nearly always the ease •in
Australia to-dav when anything is wrong with the
wicket. Bright exceptions were Clem Sindrey’e 70
for Richmond (7 for 152 closed) v. Prahran and
Onion’s 50 for Melbourne (169) v. Carlton. The
best bowling feat was that of Watson of St. Kilda,
who took 5 Collingwood wickets for 11 runs.
“Tren”: Frank Tarrant turned out again for Fitz-
roy, his old club, and knocked up a useful 41. He
first played for them in ’9B, but a little later became
a ground bowler at Melbourne. There “Plum” Warner
spotted him and signed him up for Middlesex as a
to that other great Australian, Albert Trott.
At Lord’s, Frank improved wonderfully, and soon
became the best all-round cricketer in England,
making 1000 runs and taking 100 wickets in eight
consecutive seasons, 1907—1914. Thin the war
stoppqjl his gallop, and he sojourned in India with
Ranji. Australia had one short glimpse of him during
his great period, when he came home in 1907. He
was then picked in the Victorian XI, and justified his
inclusion by batting in his best English form. Against
N. S. Wales he answered Syd Gregory’s 201 with a
match-winning and record score of 206 ; and against
South Oss he compiled 105. His bowling, however,
was harmless. Though now 43, and well cashed up,
he is as keen as ever, and badly wants to have a
bash for Victoria against Gregory’s thunderbolts.

“J.H.” (Lond.) : Sydney Pardon, who
edits Wisden’s Almanack, and is as sound a judge
as there is in the world, was telling me at Lord’s
the other day that he can’t visualise A. E. R.
Gilligan as a successful fast bowler during the Test
matches in Australia. He is not enthusiastic about
Howell either, but pins his faith mainly to Tate
and Roy Kilner. Australia will like Kilner. The
Yorkshireman keeps a beautiful length, is deadly
on a doubtful wicket, and as a batsman goes for
the bowling with the gay abandon of a Hobbs or
a Woolley. In my judgment lie is by far the best
all-rounder England has sent out for many years.
Hobbs, Woolley and Sutcliffe! are three crackerjaeks,
but I don’t think Sandham will be a success. The
M.C.C. made a big mistake in omitting Hammond,
the Gloucester batsman, whom Aubrey Faulkiner con-
siders one of England’s very best; and a bowler who
should never have been left behind is Macaulay, the
■Yorkshireman. Nor should Fender have 1 been passed
oyer. He is far the best of the county captains;
his handling of a weak Surrey attack in the match
at the Oval between Surrey and Yorkshire (the
Tykes were licked) was masterly. Fender’s offence
seems to be that he only went to St. Paul’s, you
know, and not to Eton, Harrow, Oxford or Cam-
bridge. English cricket is severely handicapped by
its Harrises, Hawkes and Eaceys, its snobbish dis-
tinctions between amateurs and professionals and its
dreary inter-county jealousies.
*;’ * * *
“Machete” : J. B. Joel, who has blossomed
surprisingly since his Jo’burg days, is creeping
nearer and nearer to a peerage. Racing has brought
him well up among the climbers, but the best thing
be has achieved to date is the haughty M.C.C.’s
endorsement of the cricket team he has financed ro
tour S’Africa. Led by Lionel Tennyson, the side is
a fairly strong one and includes our old friend A. C.
Russell, here with the last English team. Joel
has already issued a challenge to the team now
bound for Australia, and, if it can be arranged, the
elevens will meet in England when they return.

“Winkle”: Popular opinion, expressed in
offers of 6 to 1 on or 5 goals in, came a horrible
thud when, for the first time in the history of
Australian football, the premiers of Melbourne’s two
rival bodies met. The League is reckoned to play
a far superior game, and many thousands follow its
even’ team, whereas 6ome Association clubs are
lucky if a couple of hundred locals urge them on.
Yet Essendon, the League’s elect, fell with a dismal
wallop before Footscray, who scored fit to 36. The
fact is that Footscray is a rich club, and its money
has talked to such purpose that Con. McCarthy,
once Collingwood’s champion, and captain of the
League inter-State team, Eason, sometime the best
rover in the League, and several other former
League stalwarts now bog in for ’Scray. A crowd
of 46,000 witnessed the League’s humiliation, and
Melba’s fund for soldiers benefited to the extent of
£2BOO.

The finish of club football in Adelaide w as

of the premiership. West Torrens were comfortably

behinds (Bent kicked 10 of the goals) to 12 —10.
Sturt, after beating Port Adelaide easily, put in some
really uncanny kicking, 10 goals 3 behinds, against

“Centurion": The All Blacks cleared an-
other of the stiff Welsh hurdles in their path when
they defeated Newport in their sixth game by
13 —10. The 1905 All Blacks won the same game
by 6 —3, while the Wallabies did the trick by 5—3. The
first ’Boks won B—o8 —0 and the second lot were beaten
9—3. On Saturday the tourists took on one of
the strongest of the Midland teams in Leicester and
won by 27—0, or one point less than Gallagher's
men scored in 1905. The 10 points registered by
Newport is the highest tally put up against a
Maoriland team in Britain, save 13 and 16 scored
by Halifax Wanderers and Yorkshire against the
M.L. native team of 1888-89. The highest against
the 1905 All Blacks was 8 by Cardiff and France.

“J.H.” : The many defeats of the British
Rugby team in S’Africa should not be taken too
seriously. The side in no way represents the strength
of Rugby here, and those who are counting on its
poor record as any sort of collateral guide to what is
likely to happen when the All Blacks meet England
are making a big mistake. Wakefield, one of the
best forwards in the world, Jacob and Catcheside.
the English wings, Locke and Corbett, the centres, and
Myers, the five-eighth, were unable to go to
Africa. Tn all probability England will be strengthened
this year by the return to the game of Lieutenant
C. A. Kershaw, R.N., who “retired” a year ago, but
who has just received a shore appointment and is
eager to “bog in” once again. I would have one
other player on the English side were I a selector,
namely. Dr. R. L. Raymond, of Sydney. “Pup” is
the best wing three-quarter in British Rugby to-day.
The All Blacks have the highest opinion of him. And
yet he has only an even money chance of getting his
Blue for Oxford. The cliqueism among the gentry
who rule the roost down there has to be experienced
to be believed. I know something of it; so do Tommy
Lawton, young Gordon Wesche (who was treated dis-
gracefully last year) and other Australian Rugby
men.
* * * *
“.T.H.” (Lond.) : The defeats of the Bri-
tish Rugby team in S’Africa should not be taken too
they should each nominate one of their cracks for
inclusion in the team to tour Australia next season
has not been enthusiastic. According to the Athletic
News, they are all hanging back. The big clubs of
the British League are nothing but limited-liability
companies, and their shareholders naturally want divi-
dends. A club’s assets are a good ground and a
certain number of star players, who bring in the
revenue. These men come expensive. A crack centre
forward from, say, Everton may be able to claim a
transfer fee of £2500 —a man badly wanted for a
special position cost £6OOO not long ago —and his
wages are £lO a week. To send a valuable animal
of this sort on a voyage of 12,000 miles, to a climate
whose air and beer may disagree with him, is a
matter not to be lightly considered. There is the
risk of accident on the hard Australian grounds, with
their wild blacks and bushrangers and bunyips. He
may play himself stale by the time the next English
season starts early in September, and will thus risk,
not only his drawing power, but also his cash value,
if his club wishes to sell him. That we shall get
a team of stars out is in the highest degree unlikely.
Even the first reserves will probably not be available.
* * * *
“H. Ilardupp” : The “wetness” of the royal
and ancient game of bowls gives it an added attrac-
tion for many enthusiasts, but there is a club at
Armadale (Vic.), where malted and spirituous liquors
are absolutely taboo. The deed of gift by which
a wealthy enthusiast vested the green and club-
room in the present hands provides that consumption
of strong waters on the premises under any circum-
stances will lead to the cancellation of the gift;
this rules out even the possibility of members’ lockers
being converted into collarettes, a common enough
subterfuge in ostensibly “temperance” bowling
clubs. The members, making a joke-of compulsion,
humorously greet visitors with invitations to split
a barley-water. But there aren’t many visitors.
BALLADE OF SUFFICIENT BOODLE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
‘‘Mr. Merritt, manager of the Australian Olympic
team which returned on Saturday, gave an emphatic
contradiction to the report that the tourists were
short ot: money. They had as much as they wanted
—or, at any rate, as much as was good for them.”
They went for their lives and laughed at odds,
Won or were walloped, fair and square,
Charlton and Carr and the Murray “Cods,”
Eve and Winter and Beaurepaire;
Gathered- —or reached for—over there
Laurel and bay for a diadem.
Who was it hinted at pockets bare?
They’d all the dough that was good for them.
Bursting wallets and bulging wads
Athletes’ prowess may well impair;
Spending silver prove stinging rods
Backs to biff, or a trap to snare
Limbs that water should cleave or air
With nothing earthy to stay or stem.
What though there wasn’t cash to spare?
They had as much as was good for them.
Paris to razzle goads and prods,
Coaxes, too, as you’re all aware.
Swimmers amphibious as river gods
May feel a craving for dainty fare;
Beds as fleet as the stag or hare
M insome faces don’t all contemn.
So though the tout's mayhap were rare
Our chaps had all that were good for them.
EN'OY.
Boodle ad lib is a source of care
In the primrose paths that sirens hem, '
Where pleasure beckons you. Howsoe’er
They had as much as was good for them.

THE pistons of a motor engine must
fit to the thousandth part of an

a spider s web. This thm film of oil
must he capable of withstanding enor-
mous heat and the frictional pressure of
metal surfaces moving at tremendous
speeds. And it must he able to do this
throughout the entire operation of the
motor; not merely part of the time*
The weaving of a spiders web
calls for the most patient care. So
does the preparation of lubricating

THE INKY WAY.
11. E. Holland, leader of the M. 1.. Labor party
and an inky-wayfarer for many years, has just hail
a collection of his verses made into a book, with
“Red Roses on the Highways” for title.
“built' : Tom Kel.vnaek (“Kickero” of Melbourne
Herald), will follow the English cricket XI on its
Australian tour as representative of Reuter. He has
had the job more than once before.
“Uramao” : Just retired from Christchurch Weekly
I’ress (M.L.), R. W. Eastwood, who began as a
compositor 45 years ago, and finished up as assist-
ant editor. His Volunteer an 1 Service notes in the
Press under the pen-name of “Bullseye” were widelv
read. Maoriland’s defence scheme was born in his
column.
“Coot”: Add to the honor-list of those identified
with the Ballarat Star (B. 11/9/’24), William
Coxon, who for 67 years was a proofreader on that
paper. Although 82 years old he worked right up
to the last day of publication. In his youth he was
a prominent cricketer, and played for Ballarat against
U. G. Grace’s first English XI.
“Veldt”: One-time Newcastle (N.S.W.) scribe
George King-swell, now a Rand newspaper potentate,
has been having a very; rough time of it. He has
had three serious operations (the trouble started with
a straying clot of blood), and just as he was cor-
ns leseent his son was rushed to the operating-table
and knifed just in time. Both are now doing well.
“Hamer"; The advantages of giving a journalist
the job of secretary are being felt by the Melbourne
Alfred Hospital, for which D. G. Macdougall is running
a bright monthly, the Alfred. The little mag. not
only contains interesting matter but is a constant
reminder of the hospital and its work and its needs:
moreover, it has not cost the institution a pennv,
but is already a contributor to the funds.
“The Deacon”: Gone out, at Ashfield, Sydney,
Alfred Augustus James, who made a bold bid to put
a second free paper on the map of the Western
Suburbs. A tribute to the popularity of his Arcus
and the plucky fight of its proprietor was witnessed
on the day 7 of his going hence; even the local wine
bar desisted from the pursuit of the rent for a couple
of hours, and joined in the mourning.
Published his last book, Sir Algernon Methuen
(Algernon Methuen Marshall Stedman). He had
written 26 educational books before he founded Meth-
uen and Co. in 1889. The first book he fathered was
Edna Lyall’s “Derrick Vaughan, Novelist,” now in
its 74,000 ; and he followed this success with Kip-
ling's “Barrack Room Ballads” in 1895. A director
of the concern is E. V. Lucas, who is also its literarv
adviser.
“0.P.H.”: So far as the oldest political inhabi-
tants know, Prendergast is the first printer among
the 28 Vic. Premiers. Charles Cavan Duffy contri-
buted to the press, but I don't think he ever got
close enough to the “stone” to make up a forme.
Bowser (now Speaker), who headed a Government
for four months (1917-18), owns the Wangaratta
Chronicle, and has a pretty intimate acquaintance
with types, chases and presses, but he is a writer,
not a printer.
Mervyn J. O’Hara, an ambitious young man who
has made a fresh ripple on the disturbed waters of
the Sydney A.L.P. by bringing charges of selection
irregularities against Murphy, M.L.A., and T. Lister,
secretary of the North Shore Electorate Labor Council,
is a journalist who has produced some humorous
slight stories and paragraphs in addition to serious
work. He was himself a candidate for Labor selec-
tion in North Sydney, so his passion for unfaked
ballots is not unselfish.
“Quiz”; While examining some volumes of Dickens
left by a Melbourne man who died recently, the
executor found, neatly folded in an envelope, between
pages of “Pickwick Papers,” a well-preserved copy
of the Port Phillip Gazette, dated April 24, 1848.
Its Dickens interest is contained in a two-column
report of an address delivered by the novelist at
the official opening of the City Hall in Glasgow,
where he was the guest of honor.
“S.T.S.”: Another instance of the value of a
comma more or less. A recent truly-American novel
published in London talks (or means to talk) of a
drink of “corn whisky and soda-water.” The printer
evidently never heard of spirit made from “corn,” so
he presents the astonishing combination of “corn,
whisky, and soda-water.” Incidentally, it’s about
time we Australians agreed upon a definition of “corn.
In Adelaide for instance, corn is grain—any farm
grain—as it is in England. In Sydney, corn is
maize and nothing but maize, as it is in America.
“Rio”: What does Arthur Lynch mean by his
statement (B. 18/9/’24) that Australia remained
neutral in the Boer War? She did nothing of the
sort. There was no Commonwealth in 1899, but all
the States sent contingents of fighting troops and
the Federal Government continued this policy when
it took over. As a part of the Empire, Australia
could not be neutral. Lynch may be able to justify
himself in his own eyes for fighting against his
own countrymen; but to claim that Australia was
neutral is nonsense.
“Sunraysia”: When Harry Lapthorne sold the Mil-
dura Cultivator to C. J. DeGaris, who incorporated
it in Sunraysia Daily, he handled a respectable
cheque and counted himself fortunate. Putting the
proceeds into a Merbein irrigation block, he started
to grow fruit instead of telling others how to do so.
But Mildura began to have wet summers, and, coin-
cidently but not consequently, prices tumbled. Lap-
thorne bought at the top of the market and has had
to sell at the bottom. And now he's back again at
the old game. Inky-wayfarers Will wish him well
on the Temora Independent.
“Imbaga”: Elinor Mordaunt, the novelist, who has
been staying for a couple of months in the Tro-
briands, a south-eastern group of Papuan atolls
famous for its tall, upright men and ladies inclined
to be neither, has been giving Samarai officialdom
a bit of her mind because it grabbed some prohibited
bird-of-paradise skins the lady was carrying out oi
the territory 7 . “Alleged white men, to satisfy a
private grudge, and using dinner-table conversation,
acted as informants,” said the indignant lady to a
newspaper correspondent who happened in. she
likes the Trobrianders, and thinks Papua would be a
great country 7 “if only the missionaries and other
mean whites would let it alone.” After that obser-
vation the lady’s other remark that the paradise which
the Trobrianders live in “is one for which the
mission tries can offer a very poor substitute makes
me think she lias fallen foul of the Methodist
mission, which is pre-eminent in the south-eastern
division.
MISREPRESENTATION.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Mr. Hughes attended the House to make a per-
sonal explanation. An evening newspaper had re-
ported him as having referred to Mr. Bruce as a
‘mug.’ He denied that he used the word ‘mug.’ It
svas not part of his vocabulary. The reporter’s ex-
planation was that, with Mr. Hughes's consent, he
had summarised his remarks.”
When Hughes proceeds to make remarks
About his dear opponent's ways,
The atmosphere is full oi sparks
That stream aloft through purple haze.
To set down just the word he’ll use
Might send a pressman to the jug,
So, summarising Mister Hughes,
We say he called his friend “a mug.”
We drop the heated asterisk,
The breathless dash, the blinking blanks,
The objurgations bold and brisk
Through which the acid Billy pranks ;
Pull from the bomb the smoking fuse.
Heap on the fire a well-soaked rug.
Don’t doubt it when you’re told by Hughes
He’d scorn to call his friend, “a mug” !

This Sundry Showman had the time of
his life at Sydney Palace on Saturday even-
ing. when for one night only he belabored
his Avife, threw the breakfast eggs and bacon
at the cook, flung the pillows in one corner
and the bolster in another and generally
behaved as the primitive male is entitled to
behave. A glance around the stalls assured
him that every man in the audience was en-
joying the same unlawful sensations. Every
one of them was a Petruchio, even if his
female accompaniment did not feel a Kath-
arina. When, however, the tamed shrew
made her famous final speech, exhorting
wives to
Vail your stomachs, for it is no boot;
And place your hands below your husband’s foot,
the gigglings of blasphemous flappers who
refused to be impressed restored normality;
husbands resumed their air of dejected servi-
tude and meekly helped their wives into
their cloaks and wraps.
* * * *
Allan Wilkie is to be commended for ignor-
ing the unwarrantable subtleties which gen-
erations of learned commentators have read
into Shakspeare’s text. An honest, rough-
handed, unsentimental comedy was “The
Taming of the Shrew” as presented by him.
with just enough bowdlerising of the original
text to lull the suspicions of a moral police-
man. Wilkie as Petruchio ranted consis-
tently, but Miss Hunter-Watts allowed
Katharina some gentler periods to punctuate
her tantrums. With each new presenta-
“OLD BILL. M.P.,” AT MELBOURNE
PALACE.
Despite the earnest counsel of Mr. Park
(Leslie Donaghey) , Old Bill (Seymour
Hicks) refuses to go out on strike.
tiott of the old themes Wilkie adds fresh
business, which his well-drilled troupe of
mummers carries through with more and
more ease. Claude Saunders, the South Aus-
tralian, as Tranio masquerading for Lucen-
tio, showed that Jack can be as good as his
master; and Jean Atholl made Bianca’s
sweet submissiveness an effective foil to
Ivatharina’s rages. It would be safe to say
that almost nobody in the audience realised
that most of the play was performed before
the same set of somewhat dingy curtains.
At Sydney Majesty’s “Whirled into Happi-
ness” progresses merrily, with the gyrations
into felicity of Alfred Frith and Winnie
Collins as vigorous as ever. The dancing is
good, and the standard of feminine attrac-
tiveness above normal.
The charm of “Little Nellie Kelly” shows
no signs of slackening at Sydney Opera
House.
In “The Cousin From Nowhere,” at Syd-
ney Royal, Marie Burke has brought from
vaudeville a graceful figure, a clear soprano
voice and some practised stagecraft into the
role of Julia, wherein Jill Manners was pre-
viously being tried much too high for a tyro
Floie Allan continues to be irresistible, and
the heel-and-toe work of the “Twelve Tulips
earns a nightly v.h.c. from the experts of
the stalls.
*tj ;V jjc
Walter Weems, who specialises in coon
turns, is the Sydney Tivoli’s latest acquisi-
tion. Walter is an agreeable Sambo, and
hardly any of his jokes are old enough to
wear whiskers. Mr. Hymac has revolution-
ised the somewhat tiresome job of shedding
and donning clothes. There seems to be no
limit to Albert Whelan’s repertoire, and his
whistle inspires the youthful section of the
audience to greater deeds in blowing through
the teeth. Bert Errol is excellent so long
as he keeps to female impersonations: as a
mere male he has little to recommend him.
Fiddler Maggie Foster is well to the fore,
and the rest of the show is good.
With three-quarters of Sydney’s million
talking horse, Stiffy and Mo are red-hot
favorites as “The Jockeys” at Fuller’s
Theatre. These breezy comedians have
chaff-bags full of equestrian skits and
jingles, and such is the present gee-gee craze
that it is only necessary for one of the pair
to crack a whip to raise a laugh.
“Fisher’s Ghost” is walking at Iloyt’s
(Sydney). Longford, who put “The Senti-
mental Bloke” on the screen, is responsible
for the appearance of this spook of old Syd-
ney. “The Ghost” hasn’t the overflowing
human interest of “The Bloke,” but it is a
commendable effort to re-live a little of the
life of the early days. “Flowing Gold,”
a picture of quick action, is the supporting
film.
<: s’:
Reflections on the closing of the Show :
The N.S.W. Society of Artists is gratified because
sales exceeded £2OOO, which amount must be divided
amongst a large number of exhibitors and
represents for some of them the only return
for a year’s conscientious effort. During
the last ' financial year the Queensland Gov-
ernment spent £1,593,066 above revenue on
railways that are neither as ornamental nor as useful
as they might be. “A painted ship upon a painted
ocean” would be considered dear at a few guineas,
but the Commonwealth Government did not scruple
to spend £2,064,150 on wooden ships that were
no use whatever. The price of a pictured landscape
that might be a joy for ever is seldom quoted above
two figures; but somebody was found the other day
to cheerfully hand out £1750 a foot for a strip
of soil in Sydney on which he will never set eyes.
In 1922 20,674,548 feet of American “fillum” were
imported, and for the privilege of glimpsing the
effervescent stuff Australian audiences were prepared
to part with many hundreds of thousands of pounds.
Under the circumstances the gratified artists are a
modest lot.

The Melbourne Repertory Society filled
the Playhouse on four evenings of last
week with “Dear Brutus,” one of the
successes of the 1922 London season
and a fair example of Barrie’s delicate
whimsicality. A mysterious ancient named
Lob gathers in his house a collection
of disgruntled people, all save one dissatis-
fied with what they have made of their lives,
in order that he may try upon them the
effect of an up-to-date “Midsummer Night's
Dream.” Turned adrift in a magic wood,
they have a chance to model their lives
afresh, and each makes a fresh hash of it,
except Dearth, the drunken artist, who, find-
ing his otherwise starved heart satisfied with
the possession of an affectionate daughter,
is a regenerated and happy worker, whilst
his cold-hearted wife, who accentuates his
weaknesses by despising them, is the deserted
wife, driven to starvation and mendicancy,
of the wealthy man she normally regrets not
having married. As, each chastened, the
dreamers wake again to their normal life,
there is a pathos in the protest of the dream-
daughter against being deprived of the exist-
ence the vision has given her; but the artist,
waking to the sorrow’ of the loss of his
dream, is the first to wish to thank Lob for
his glorious hour of healthy happiness.
« * • •
Quite a distinguished representation was
that of Ceridwen Kelly as Margaret, the lov-
ing, boydenisk dream-daughter of the one-
time drunken artist, Will Dearth —the latter
played very naturally by Helton Daniell, who
deserves a word for his work also as pro-
ducer. Norman Simpson was a stiffish John
Purdie, a philanderer who, married to Mabel
(Elizabeth Woodyatt), believes himself in
love with Joanna Trout (Edith Bell), but
in the wood is married to Joanna and de-
sires Mabel; and George Faulkner made the
difficult character of old Lob reasonable.
Charles Row (a butler), Robert Guthrie,
Edith Fraser, Maisie Bennett and Madge
Morrison filled other parts more or less ade-
quately.

The illness of Edith Drayson lias made a
definite change in the cast at His Majesty’s,
Melbourne, where Bryl Walkley is now
established in the part of the lady who puts
Colonel Belovar in his place. The change
gives the copper-thatched Linda Foy a chance
as leader of the ballet, of which she takes
“WHIRLED INTO HAPPINESS." AT

ting a customer, but I don't give a darn
to-day; I've just won a quid.”
rather poor advantage. The lady is graceful
in her dancing; but her tempestuousness is
most unconvincing, and her singing voice is
weak. But “The Lady of the Rose” is such
an excellently constructed play that it man-
ages to go on very well in spite of some
striking weaknesses in the cast.
The music of public coin dropping into the
coffers still sounds as melodious to the mana-
gerial ear at Melbourne New Princess’s as
“The Rise of Rosie O’Reilly” does to the
populace.
“Old Bill, M.P.,” at the New Palace in
Melbourne, is well in his stride now. Audi-
ences at that comfortable theatre have de-
cided that he is a Long-felt Want, and cheer
the simple-hearted chap on his w’ay to Parlia-
ment.
The Gala Performance at His Majesty’s,
Melbourne, in aid of the Limbless Soldiers’
Fund, is definitely fixed for next Monday;
and, as Melba has been getting about again,
there should be no new hitch. “La Boheme”
is to be put on, with the Dame herself as
Mimi.
Harry Weldon introduced his act, “The
Policeman,” last Saturday to a Melbourne
Theatre Royal audience which gave all the
known noises indicative of joy; yet Hilda
Giyder, with an inconsiderable voice, im-
parts such a fine finish to her work that
she is the most persistently recalled person
of the show.

Scott and Whaley have struck the popu-
lar taste of Melbourne Tivoli audiences, and
share first honors with Bert Levy. Return
visitors include Victoria Carmen, w'ho is the
sort of lady to cause habitues of front stalls
to bring their best glasses. And an evening
at the Tiv. always produces an inclination
to say a word about “Bob” Keers and the
orchestra he leads.
The serious problems of matrimony
(American models) are not troubling Hoyt’s
de Luxe this week, where “The Galloping
Fish,” which is a swnft medley of trained
seal, laughter and sensation, holds first place.
Kitty Reidy is to go elsewdiere after to-
morrow, unless the way in which she has
filled the seats induces an extension of her
season. An even more definite personal at-
traction is the appearance of Louise Lovely
at the Majestic, to give all and sundry an
opportunity of testing their value as owners
of “screen-type faces.” The chief support-
ing film is “Broadway After Dark” —a well-
constructed drama with a touch of humor
in it.
** * #
Two contrasting Melbourne shows: —
All the vigor of style associated with Norman
Lindsay is exhibited in his show of 22 pen-and-ink
drawings and 17 water-colors at the Art Society’s
Gallery, Melbourne. In spite of defective draughts-
manship in much of his work, and a perversion of
nature in many of his figures, Lindsay by his force
and daring has made himself a niche all his own in
art; and with all their idiosyncrasies most of the
drawings in this show are masterpieces. “Valkyrie,”
for instance, is an amazing composition in water-
color containing action and a sense of breadth and
mysticism which only Lindsay can give; and the
pen-and-ink drawing, “The Birth of Life,” is in
the same category. Certainly the lower portion of
the latter picture is horrible; but the upper part,
a wonderfully grouped representation of the passions
in their more exalted moods, is equally beautiful.
Part of the duty of this exhibition is to advertise
an edition-de-luxe portfolio of reproductions, limited
to 500 copies, at three guineas each. They will be
rushed.
It would be reasonable to take the Norman Lindsay
show as a protest against the sort of thing that is
greatly in evidence at the Annual Exhibition of the
Women’s Art Club at the Athenaeum Hall. Much of
it is mawkish ; yet, making due allowance for the
acknowledged amateurishness of some of the ex-
hibitors, the show reaches a fair standard. There
is some pretty work in the Sculptures and Applied
Art sections —“pretty,” and little more than that. The
best pictures are provided by Miss A. M. E. Bale, who,
although she fails in an awkwardly-posed portrait
(No. 72), strikes a note of fidelity in “The Yarra
at Ivew,” and is responsible for the show’s most artis-
tic offering in “Iceland Poppies.” Miss Cumbrae
Stewart, whose “Durham Castle” exhibits a fine
appreciation of tone values, is represented by) pains-
taking work in a number of semi-nudes; and Miss
Norah Gordon has some delightful work in “The
Dandenongs” and “Mountain Mists.” Miss E. L.
Spowers is best represented by “Washing Day in
Prance,” and Mrs. Daryl Lindsay by “The Brewery,
Richmond,” unaffected work with an honest apprecia-
tion of color. The composition of Miss D. Stone's
“The Hillside, Ferny Creek,” is good; but Miss
Wilkinson Whyte crowds her canvas. A bright feature
is some of Miss Dora Wilson’s pastel work, with its
delicate treatment of flesh-tints.
Opera is such an enthusiastic success at
Adelaide Royal that the season has twice
been extended. The appearance of Melba in
two renderings of “Bolieme” caused a riot of
enthusiasm. The visitors seem delighted, and
wonder why an Adelaide season was ever in
doubt. Pictures are very American and very
emotional; but motor-racing sensations are
promised.

From an Adelaide critic:—
Two finely-contrasted sets of etchings look at each
other from opposite walls of Preece’s gallery. Van
Raalte (now technical adviser to the Art Gallery of
S.A.) specialises in drypoint. He learned about big
gum-trees while in Westralia, and somehow con-
trives to give them a personal touch, with a back-
ing mostly of thunder-clouds. He recalls the spirited
but gloomy landscapes ofi Dore. A Van Raalte pic-
ture hardly ever needs a signature. There are a few
touches of the Dutch origin of his family, but these
mostly introduce figures, with which he is less at
home. The etchings of Sydney Ure Smith are far
more modestly priced. They are examples of deadly
Scott and Whaley, black-faced comedians.
MELBOURNE TIVOLI.
accuracy in the portrayal of bits of old Sydney or
Windsor. Fences in particular have a strong attrac-
tion for him. With high technical skill, lie must
work rather for the satisfaction of himself and
other artists than to attract the unthinking public.
* * * *
Jenny Golder, an Australian girl, who
came by way of the Folies Bergeres,
has been giving London a taste of Parisian
stage naughtiness—especially in an un-
dressing scene behind a shadowgraph. The
critics w r ere unanimously Puritanical, but the
management reported that business had
never been brisker. At the Folies 8., of
course, such a turn wouldn’t raise a single
somnolent eyelid. In London, how T ever, it
attracts like a Norman Lindsay drawing.

“Wodgil”: I suppose the vogue of plays
in which the heroines are shopgirls, and of
newspapers which seem to be mostly written
for shopgirls by shopboys, had a great deal
to do with the thrusting of a shopgirl on
the playgoing public in a leading part. But
the-thing was too outrageous for even Syd-
ney people to tolerate, accustomed as they
have grown to immature performers being
presented as stars, and after a week of it
the poor girl disappeared from the cast, a lady
from the Tivoli taking her place. The
business was brutally unfair to the comely
young woman, who, at the least, will be
subjected to cattish commiseration, whether
she starts again in the chorus or returns to the
lace-counter; unfair also to bright members
of the Williamson companies (Thelma Bur-
ness, for instance) who have been qualifying
by hard work for just such an opportunity
as was given to a raw novice. Also, it is
particularly stupid to play such pranks with
the public, considering that Hugh Ward is
a competitor in the field, and is forging
steadily ahead. Ward never stoops to the
folly of easting green amateurs for principal
parts.
Albert Whelan settles the matter:—
Here are the facts regarding my impersonation of
Girard as Ichabod Bronson in “The Belle of New
fork.” I first played Girard’s part at the second
matinee in Melbourne. After that I played every
matinee in Melbourne and Sydney; also the first
night in Adelaide and the fourth and subsequent
nights in that city'. The Adelaide pressmen wrote
their first-night notices as if Girard had appeared.
When they learned what had happened, one of them
acknowledged in a courtly strain that Williamson
possessed the best staff of liars he had ever come
across. After Adelaide I was Ichabod for a week in
Sydney, as Girard had died ; and in 1901 I produced
a revival of “The Belle” at London Adelphi, playing
lead. As for “Bad Bill’s” assertion (B. 28/8/’24)
that “very few were deceived,” the audience at the
first Melbourne matinee never for. a moment suspected
that someone had taken the American’s place. And
at the first Sydney matinee the manager and the
treasurer had a bet as to whether Girard or
Whelan was appearing.
“Caesar’s Ghost” : George Titheradge was
described at a Melbourne meeting recently
as. the “discoverer” of the daffodil. The
“discovery” was anticipated by a dramatist
whom Tith. held in the highest reverence,
and -who wrote (in 1600 or thereabouts) of
daffodils that come “before the swallow
dares,” and there were anterior discoverers—
droves of them. But George certainly helped
to popularise the yellow flower in Australia.
He got the daffodil habit from a nursery-
man in a little country , town when touring
the Victorian “smalls.” On the next appear-
ance of the company in Melbourne daffodils
were in the stage decorations, and figured in
the floral offerings at the end of the first
night’s performance. Thus was set a daffo-
dil fashion which has never w r aned. Tith-
eradge, by the way, was responsible for one
or two new varieties of roses. His Rose
Bay garden used to be one of the sights of
Sydney, and he turned his hobby to account
during the long rests which were part of
every Australian actor’s lot in his day.
“R.K.D.N.”: Oscar Asehe, according to
the cable, has had no luck with his first
London production since arriving back from
his Australian tour. The big man generally
gets some sort of run out of his pieces, but
“The Royal Visitor” exhausted London in a
week, “inconceivably dull” is, we are told,
the verdict of the critics. I should like to
have heard Oscar’s reference to those per-
sons on the last night.
“Clement R. d’Uppe”: I often wonder
why Australian theatrical firms which send
big productions on tour, and spend thousands
of pounds in the transport of cumbersome
flats, back-cloths and borders, don’t make
a trial of paper scenery for standard’ sets.
I never saw any canvas or calico on any of
the big South American stages, and when
our co. arrived at the Theatro de I’Opera
in Buenos Aires with a ship’s hold full of
dangling battens and bulky flats as mount-
ings for the 15 musical comedies in our re-
pertoire, the stage-hands growled horriblv
in several languages. There the full stage
equipment consisted
of light battens, on
which the paper
scenery was
stretched. We had
to resort to paper
ourselves before the
season finished.
Some disagreement
arose between our
management and
the Argentine en-
trepreneur who
financed it, and,
as “The Duchess
of Dafizic” was
mentioned in the
contract, he in-
sisted upon its
production. A sur-
vey of our bits and
pieces revealed that
the sole relics of
Ivan Caryll’s best
effort in our pos-
session were three
musical scores and
Josephine’s dress.
But II o w a r d
Glover, a fine
scenic artist, got
to work on the
paper, and in a
fortnight produced
one of the most
satisfying series of
sets I have seen.
Edouard Jose, a
nephew of Van
Biene, taught the
principals and
chorus from the
three scores; a
local musician
scribbled off the
band parts for full
orchestra, and the
costumes and pro-
perties were sup-
plied from the
enormous property
room of the theatre
itself a marvellous
place. containing
complete wardrobe
equipment and props, for almost every
opera that has been written. The company
put its heart into the show, and “The
Duchess” was our biggest success. Sidney
Mannering, now in Melbourne, took the part
of the gentleman who sings “Noblesse
Oblige,” and the little barber was imper-
sonated by Bertie Walton, who is also earn-
ing a crust in Australia, or was when I last
heard of him.
“F.L.H.” : I hope Allan Wilkie isn’t super-
stitious. He is the thirteenth mummer to
play Richard 111. in Australia. Brooke in-
troduced Crookback in 1855 at the Mel-
bourne Olympic. The others were Barry
Sullivan, Kean, Montgomery, Anderson and
Louise Arnot in the ’sixties; J. B. Howe,
Fairclough. Cathcart and Dampier in the
next decade; Bill Leake (’81) and George
Miln (’B9). Wilkie’s first try was eight
years ago.
“Caesar’s Ghost”: I am indebted to the
Firm’s press-agent for valuable information
about “the opportunities that await young
Australians on their own stage,” and for
the statement that “the list was further
added to last Saturday afternoon when John
Ralston played Howett Worster’s role of
Colonel Belovar.” And then it is explained
that “Mr. Ralston comes from Brisbane.”
This “discovery” of the useful Ralston is
rather amazing seeing that he has been
appearing, mainly with the Firm, for at
least a couple of decades, and was “the well-
known Australian actor” when he took a
trip to America.
“F.L.H.”: “Second Murderer” (B.
25/9/’24) mentions that Caron, Searelle,
Cellier and Harrison conducted without the
score. Good musicians all, but I can’t
imagine any of them piloting “Aida” through
its numerous difficult situations as Paolan-
tonio did. As for Harrison having taken
a missing tenor’s place at a moment’s notice,
a liberal allowance of fiction has been added
to the facts. On the night before the premiere
of “The Mikado” Nellie Stewart, Alice Bar-
nett, Vernon, Woodfield. Boyle and others
sang some numbers from that work at a
benefit to scene-painter Gordon (incidentally,
the excerpts were given without make-up or
costume and fell flat). On that occasion
Boyle’s “indisposition” was so noticeable
that Harrison rehearsed the part next morn-
ing. Vernon was my authority, and ho
should have known.
“Irymple”: To the cast of George Rig-
nold’s “Faust” at Her Majesty’s, Sydney,
on Easter Saturday, ISSS (B. 25/9 / ’24).
add the name of Marie Lohr, now well in
the London spotlight. Marie “walked on”
as a little toddler eating a hot-cross bun.
“C.G.”: Roland Fisher, just dead as the
result of a motor accident in London, was
partly responsible for Australia getting so
few English and Continental films. Origi-
nally associated with Spencer’s in Sydney, he
TRUE TO ATMOSPHERE.
“You know, I think the tone of Dabster's picture is rather
too blue."

was taken over when the Australasian Films
Co. was formed, and was sent to Europe.
He supplied reports and a recommendation
regarding every new film shown in or near
London, and the advice was “No” as to at
least 90 per cent, of them.
“J.F.H.” (Lond.) : There is a prospect of
the “Old Vic.” Shakspearean co. making
a tour of Australia and Maoriland. The
manageress, Lilian Baylis, is at the moment
in South Africa arranging for a visit of the
co. to that country, and if business is good
in Boerland the show may go on to the Com-
monwealth. Another report of interest to
Australians is that Lily Brayton is about
to emerge from her retirement and start as
an “actress-manageress.” In 1904, the bio-
graphers announce, the lady appeared at the
Adelphi “under the management of her hus-
band and Otho Stuart”; in 1907 His
Majesty’s Theatre was “under the joint
management of her husband and herself” ; in
1916 she “entered on the management” of
the same theatre “in conjunction with her
husband.” Now (inadvertently, perhaps)
there is no reference to the husband.
“B.B.” : Admitting that Eddie McLean is
“Harnfat's” authority (B. 25/9/’24) for say-
ing that the dancer in question made his
debut at Sydney Lyceum during the Christ-
mas season of 1898, I affirm that Eddie’s
memory has slipped a cog. The Christmas
bill at the Lyceum that year was “Carmen,”
with Lilian Tree in the title-role. The
“Dick Whittington” panto, was the previous
Christmas bill. I well;'remember the two nip-
pers, and very tiny they were. Every night
after the show their dad, old Eddie, used
to drive them home to Paddington, a sulky
• —drawn by, I think, a brown pony—doing
the trip. On occasions I tossed them both
in alongside their dad.
From W. J. Farrell, who has the busiest
violin-workshop in Sydney:—
My advocacy of the use of Australian timbers for
violin-making was recently mentioned in The
Bulletin. May I state that I am convinced that
with such material and with improved construction
I can produce a better quality of tone and more of
it than could any of the old masters whose violins
were made of pine and sycamore? I maintain that
for purity of tone and carrying power, violins made
entirely of Australian timbers are absolutely unsur-
passable. The qualities of cedar make it invaluable
in this connexion. It does not warp or shrink, is
neither liable to attacks from insect pests nor affected
by climatic changes ; it is the most durable timber
we have; its acoustic properties are excellent; and
it takes a beautiful varnish.
“Abbot P.”: Farley used to do a whip-
cracking turn in “Fatinitza.” He had the
part of a Russian general, and the imple-
ment of correction was supposed to be a
knout; but, knout or stockwhip, he “always
made a hit with it,” as he was fond of claim-
ing in after years. Emily Melville, Gracif
Plaisted. Beaumont and John Forde —in one
of his 1001 parts—were in that production.
There was a previous showing, in which
Nellie Lambert, Templeton and Howard Ver-
non were the principals.
“F.N.W.”: These slipshod Yankee film-
fakers lacerate, my nerves. In an absurdity
entitled “Woman-proof” the plot turns o»
a pair of marriages performed abo rd a
steamer by the skipper thereof. Had the
president of the Intelligence Department or
some other member of the aliganisation con-
sulted the office-boy at the nearest shipping
office he would have learned that captains
of ships cannot marry impassioned passeng-
ers, however much the latter may heave their
chests. A clergyman may do the job, if
there is one on board; in that case the cap-
tain is required to register it in the official
log. But every such log contains a printed
waiting that a captain’s efforts at matri-
monial knot-tying are illegal.
“Pantagruel”: One of Phil Lytton’s
Queensland advertising stunts had the merit
of being original. It was back in 1930, when
Lytton’s co. was playing in Rockhampton
at the time of the annual show, and took
the form of an aeroplane-car race at Cal-
laghan Park racecourse. The participants
were Stone, an American airman, in a mono-
plane, and Sid Taylor, a Rockhampton man,
in a car. The two got away to an even
start, but the ’plane quickly forged ahead,
until after three laps it had a substantial
lead. Then the engine began to fail; after
q last wobbly lap it stopped, and the ’plane
crashed. Stone escaped with a severe shak-
ing, but his machine was smashed beyond
repair. The car completed the course and
was adjudged the winner. An aeroplane-car
race held this year at Richmond (N.S.W.)
between Norman Smith, the record-breaking
overlander, and Captain E. W. Percival was
described by Sydney newspapers as the first
of its kind seen in Australia, but Lytton
hit on the idea 14 years earlier.
“Hamfat”: A weakness in Australian
film-production is the slumming of the “cut-
ins.” One Yankee concern is alleged to pay
a man 40,000 dollars a year to supervise this
particular job, but some Australian pro-
ducers seem to think that any sloppy words
will do to explain a situation. The Com-
monwealth Films Department is a bright
exception; its picturesque titling and the like
are as good as anything imported. An expert
from Yankec-land used to be employed for
work of this nature, but now orders are
placed with the director of the art section
of the Melbourne Workingmen’s College,
who distributes them among his students.
Some of the young men show an uncommon
aptitude for the business.
“Peter Pan”; Certain other theatrical
luminaries might with advantage take a
lesson from the Allan Wilkies on the subject
of personal publicity. In the nine or ten
years the Wilkies have been here, Allan has
never lost trunks containing a thousand
pounds' worth of clothes, nor has he found
it impossible to play King Lear without re-
course to Guppy’s Tonic Tablets. Likewise
the Hunter-Watts lady has never had her
diamonds stolen, nor do we see her on
magazine covers impressing the world at
large with the advantages of Fairy’s Face-
cream. And if she has a passion for cooking
and lawn-mowing, she has withheld the dis-
tracting details from the public.
“A.P.”: “House Bill” (B. 2/10/’24) slips
when he asserts that played Nanki
Poo at Melbourne in ’B6. Harrison was
Nanki, Woodfield playing Pooh Bah. How-
ard Vernon was Ko Ko, Forde had the
name-part, and Benliam was Pish Tush.
What does that leave for Edwin Kelly? And
“II.B.” might have mentioned Alice Barnett.
She was rather big to be left out.
A BALLADE OF FALLEN STARS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
In what remote, unfathomed gloom,
By what brought low, do you suppose,
While poorer glitter in their room
And their command usurp, are those
Who once controlled attentive rows
As storms the forest bend and sway?
Where are the idols once we chose?
Where are the stars of yesterday ?
In many a web of Mem’ry’s loom
A strand of admiration glows,
And retrospective gleams illume
The dusty shapes of bygone shows
When saddened Recollection goes
Among its ghosts; but where are they
Evoked the magic? Ah, who knows
Where are the stars of yesterday?
Is there some shadowy tract of doom.
Some vale the adverse fates enclose,
An ante-chamber of the tomb
Where linger all whom years depose?
Loiter their feet where Lethe flows?
Or in new guises do they stray ?
Or, hidden, taste a sweet repose?—

Time, you have garnered last year’s snows,
And made last season’s love your prey,
Flung down the fruit and plucked the rose—
Where are the stars of yesterday ?

Precision
The Mark of Westinghouse
THE rule of thumb went out of the lives of men when electricity
came in, for there is something definite in its results and mea-
surable in its application.
Through the entire 300,000 different articles made by Westing-
house, ranging from a woman’s curling iron to an electric supply
station, there rules that infinite care and precision which has made
this firm’s products reliable and trustworthy.
Buyers of electrical apparatus should use the same care in se-
lecting the right make as Westinghouse uses in making its prod-
ucts.

The “Heart” of Kelvinator.
The “heart” of Kelvinator, like the heart of the
human body, pumps the refrigerating fluid round
and round its circuit. This unit, embodying a
small electric motor and compressor, is placed in
the basement—out of sight and out of mind. The
only thing you see of Kelvinator is a frost-covered
metal tank in the ice compartment of your Ice-
chest.
CITY HOMES. —By its hygienic conditions,
safeguarding health, prevention of food
waste, greater convenience, eliminates
the ice man.
COUNTRY HOMES. —Safeguards health,
preserves meat, milk, vegetables, fruit,
etc., provides cold comfort in hot
weather, operates from Farm Electric
Plant.
HOSPITALS. —Provides constant supply of
ice for fever patients. Keeps food under
hygienic conditions; cools water, pre-
serves serums, blood-tests, etc.
Preserves Food Far Longer Than Ice.
With Kelvinator in the house you can go away for
several days, leaving the Ice-chest full of perish-
able food, and on your return find your meats and
vegetables perfectly fresh and edible.
In a test. Kelvinator has kept milk sweet tw r o
weeks! liipe tomatoes were perfect at the end
of six weeks. Butter fresh after six months.
Oranges sound at the end of a year! Eggs good at
the end of two years! Kelvinator fits right into
the Ice-chest you now have.
CONFECTIONERS, SODA FOUNTAINS,
etc. —Preserves chocolate and other con-
fectionery in dry, cold conditions, thus
bringing more business. Provides cold
for Soda Fountains, prevents ice-cream
waste by keeping in frozen condition.

aerated waters and other drinks. Pre-
vents food waste, allows larger and
more economical purchases of food-
stuffs. Provides ice for table use.

Milk at night.
Milk is known as a food of especial
benefit to all. Yet to many it proves
difficult of digestion: more so when
taken at night. This is because the milk
forms into indigestible curds when it
meets the natural acid of the stomach.
If the bed-time milk—whether for
child, invalid or athlete —is made into
Benger’s Food this formation of tough
milk curd is avoided.
Two tablespoonfuls of Benger’s with
a pint of fresh milk becomes a pint of
delicious food cream, pleasing to the
taste, soothing to the stomach, sleep-
inducing, and highly nutritive.
Bengers Food is sold by Chemists, etc., everywhere.

“Wheels within Wheels”
There can hardly be found a more apt application of this old
saying than ■when applied to SKF Ball-bearing Axles.
The old-time hub is really more of a fitting to hold the axle-rod
as the centre of a circular wheel, but the races of the SKF Ball-
bearing Axle can be termed wheels in themselves —the core which
carries the outer frame-work. Thus the ball bearings eliminate
friction and drag, and allow the heaviest load to be moved with
minimum effort. The

unless stamps accompany.
J.M.8.: Thanks. To set that German
author right, it was Motuku Island (M.L.), and not
Motutapu, from which the Huns escaped in the early
days of the war... .Margaret M.: Slight and conven-
tional, but there is a streak of humor in it that’s
worth encouragement... .Psyche : Unreal. ... J.D.AA .:
Much obliged, but he and his mission had a half-column
a few weeks ago... .K.S.A.: Opens well. But in mak-
ing your, conclusion a dream and not a fact you play
a practical joke on your readers; and lots of readers
are touchy about things like that... .E.R.: Amusing
incident —but only incident... . A/.8.: Pale-faced
young man ought not to go abroad without his
mother. She would know... .B.B.II.: Can’t answer
“Enter!” to “The Call.” Ring another day
L.E.8.: l)o more sand-papering and polishing, and
you should write topical stuff that will go. ...M.H.:
“Despair” makes us hope you’ll write again....
S.R.S.: We’ll try to forget it. .. .H.M.11.: Verse
doesn’t reach Bulletin standard. Can’t say about
prose till we see it. ...A.D.: Parnassus seems to
have handed you a decent lOU, and will probably
honor it in a year or two if you keep the home-fire
burning... .Bellerive: If you’d never written another
word we should remember you for your “Tribute to
a Defeated Rooster”: —
A malady killed you, rooster Bob ;
You’ll pick and strut no more.
Lord and master of the hens,
Your crowing da vs are o'er.
11l ne’er forget your thrilling bouts,
And the day you spurred the poodle
And nearly killed old Duffy’s bird,
The fighting cockadoodle.
....Billy S.; “Student” is a neat idea, but needs
to be a little more deftly handled. .. .W.1.T.:
No, not wit; only rumor. .. . A.C.: “Driftwood” got
water-logged and finally submerged... .J. 8.: Has
an idea, but no music. And fairies and baby-angels
mix as joyously as oil and vinegar.... M.AV.: Not
this time. Anyhow, a Romany camp-fire isn’t half
as efficient as a Wolf Cub’s... .J.M.8.: Hardly a
ray in “Necropolis” and “Dawn”; but to the “In
Memorial” verse we extend Faith, Hope and Charity.
Your muse might be worth another quill. ... A. 8.8.:
Try us again with-a subject not so hackneyed. .. .
K.K.; No g00d... .F.S.T.T.: “Ammunitions” missed
this time. Third stanza quite good. Aim this way
again. .. . A. 8.: “If” is enshrined in the good old
basket... .W.H.: “The Phantom” is a fade-out; but
your verse wasn’t bad company.... J.S.D.: Tim
wouldn’t look a bit nice in print... .R.K.: Too
long for the thin idea... .T.G.P.: It goes very
jerkily... .R.R.D.: Correct enough in form, but
rather stilted, and no striking imagery to redeem
it.... Koorboora: Well, if Queensland Home Sec.
McCormick is up at the penitent form, why throw' a
brick at him?... .Heron: Some of it is usable; some
is commonplace. See if you can’t reduce it by one-
half... .A. M.: Hurrah with you! A Pennant of
the Tribute herewith:-
Against great odds and forces they strove with tides
of test,
And dipped their oars with honor, in having met
the best;
We’ll meet them and we’ll greet them, as true Aus-
tralians can,
And cheer them to the echo, each and every man.
As we have Eve and Winter, with Manly’s darling
Boy,
Returning as the Champions Australia’s pride and joy.
They broke the world’s record —their deeds shall ever
stand
Historical for ever as Australia’s noble band.
. ...C.F.: “In less than a hundred years we shall all
be dead.” You should really break things
like that more gently.... Atla: “God help
me, pard, you're right—that year is inextric-
ably interwoven -with tragedy.” Sorry, but
we must add a bit. .. .W.M. (Q.) : Bullying wife and
timid husband is a curate’s-egg story that is not
fresh even in parts. .. .H.R.: Too long for a par ; not
enough in it for a story... .Elvira: The adventures
in five chapters of Yvonne and Celeste, ending with
“Quick, the coufettj!” are left at that happy con-
clusion. .. .C.T.C.D.: Description of scared dogs as
“astonished canininity” is original, but picture of
island life suggests the philosopher’s camel....
A.M.R.: It could be put in much fewer words....
A.W.M.: Crude but strong. t Keep at it. .. .T.O.
(S.A.) : Y’our violets, faded and otherwise, are not for
this vase... .Carbonate: We tried, but couldn’t digest
it. Your bad man is too tough. . . .Dan Chaucer: You
must marshal your facts, and arguments better
than that... .W.J.T. :•- Your “Night” is like too
many other people’s nights. The other is acceptable.
....T.0.: Interesting, but no story. Christmas will
not see it L.F.H.: Our kind consideration mur-
murs that it can’t be done... .G.B. (W.A.) : “Men
never understand women.” Of course not. But give
them this credit-—they sometimes marry them in the
attempt to find out... .D.F.P.: No room. Sorry....
S.S.: Regret to hear it. If Mr. A. T. Saunders, of
Adelaide, hasn't his collection of historical notes
indexed, he doesn't deserve the compliment The
Bulletin paid him.. . .Karaji: Hardly enough in the
Borrow note M.P.S.: What an ear! There is no
hope for you until you get it tuned.... Amelia: No
use for it here if it has been already printed....
A.F.S.: There must be a score of little things you
know more about. They’re the ones we want you to
handle.... G.W.: The subject has been dealt with
so often that only very bright treatment could get it
through. Yours isn’t very bright.... Blackburn:
Ycur poet's licence is suspended for six months —
you left your track simply strewn with bad rhymes
and makeweight words... .Vangi: Not enough meat
in your stew.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INAIMTSIYC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
S.W.H.: Quite true—you’re not an expert
C.0’8.: We might have taken your hook if you
hadn't baited it with that mouldy joke.... A.E.:
What, again! L.M.; Like the world before Gene-
sis—without form and void. .. . F.T.: A out angel :s
too disturbing for this paper C.F.: Weak, hesi-
tating line. .. .1.M.P.: Your moving picture in two
reels moves us merely to anger.... E.C.P.: leeble
reminiscence of somebody else —try to look at God s
■world with your own eyes... .T.IL, 8.H., G'.H.AV.
and J.G.: Not up to standard. ... M.AI.: Your won-
derful ship will have to find another port.

IT is the new Peter Dawson
bottle. Some of our
facetious friends call it the
bottle with “ knobs on.” We
do not object to this because
anything with knobs on is above
the ordinary. Which is the
fact in this case.
But “brambles” and
“ dimples ” are happier names
for these features, which are
used to emphasise the identity
of the bottle which carries the
famous P.D. blend of genuinely
old whisky.

“Uramao”: There’s money in pintis insig-
nis. Out of one tree felled at Pakowhai
(M.L.) 4300 ft. of timber was won of a
value of £1 per 100 ft. In addition 300
fencing slabs were cut and six cords of fire-
wood. Total value, £55.
* * * *
“FY7” : A record for greasy wool was put
up. at AYinchcombe-Carson's sales in Sydney
the other day, when a French buyer paid
42d. for a clip from Read Bros’. The im-
poverished Hun could afford to pay 384 d.
for another lot, Bradford running third with
bids as high as 37:01.

“Boronia”: A Ooolgardie (AY.A.) syndi-
cate has obtained a right to exploit a kind
of acacia-tree which grows freely over an
enormous area on both sides of the goldfields
railway, and which, it is claimed, is very
rich in tannin of high quality. Those xvho
have examined skins treated with the extract
assert that it makes a better job than wattle-
bark.
* * * *
“Pantagruel” : At the opening of the new
selling season in Brisbane at the beginning
of September scoured wool realised up to
60}d. per lb. —an Australian record. This
wool consisted of eight bales from Minamere,
Nelia, away up in the North —much too far
north for sheep to do any good, we’ve been
told a thousand times.
* * * *
“Lee Q.” : Too many motor-horns and not
enough cow-horns was the conspicuous fea-
ture of the Melbourne Royal Show this year.
The fact is that Cocky’s carnival is rapidly
degenerating into a car-selling orgy. lu
a few years’ time, unless something is done
to protect the agrarian side of the function,
the only cows spoken of will be the blokes
who sell the most motors, and the speakers
will be their less successful trade rivals.
* * * *
“Uramao”: Of the 45.000.000 acres of
Maoriland sheep occupy 25,000,000, and are
now worth £25,000,000 to the country annu-
ally. Cattle, though spread over only
3.500.000 acres, yield in dairy produce
£15,000,000 and in beef nroducts £3,00f),000.
Saleable crops wave salutation to the morn
over 1,000,000 acres and are worth
£9.000.000. The total yield is £52.000.000
for the 45,000,000 acres—an average of
about £1 ss.
* * •* *
“E.M.”: At the Small Arms Factory,
Lithgow (N.S.W.), the excellence of Aus-
tralian steel for making drop forging dies
has been demonstrated to the full. Four
pail’s of dies, assorted sizes, for forging cer-
tain flanges—very rough work on dies—
were cut from a 12 x 8 inch bloom of Hos-
kins's bayonet-quality steel. Used on a
15001 b. hammer, these dies have up to date
forged 4000 flanges without showing a mark.
You can see men who know what they’re
doing taking off their hats to that steel.
* •* * *
“Cartot”: The coins unearthed by “Capta”
and his friends in France (B. 11/9/’24)
are unlikely to have been placed there by
Askings. In early Scandinavia the few gold
coins in use were generally those issued in
some other country, mostly by Roman Em-
perors at Constantinople. Moreover, Vikings
did not worship horses. It was the primi-
tive tribes living in the dark and gloomy
forests which stretched from Prussia to the
North Sea that were addicted to this cus-
tom, and it is improbable that they possessed
any coinage. Is “Capta” perfectly sure, not
only that the tokens were as old as he thought
them to be, but that they were coins at all V

“Clement R. d’Uppe” : The results achieved
by the N.S.AA r . Government’s pipe-making
plant on AA’alsh Island, into which the former
ship-building plant was converted some time
since, are thoroughly encouraging. The
Island secured a 3000-ton order from the
Sydney AVater Board, their tender being 30s.
a ton lower than any other, and is said to
be showing a decent profit over the job. A
big order for the Melbourne Metropolitan
Board of A\ r orks is also well in hand —this,
too, was secured in open competition. All
sizes of pipes, up to 72 inches, are being
welded by the Cutler-Marsden electric pro-
cess, which has x’evolutionised the industry
and bids fair to bring about a similar revolu-
tion in ship-building. The process, unheard
of three years ago, will probably be found
riveting ships’ plates before long.
* * * ■*
“Drayman”: Hobart Marine Board, in
reply to a resolution of the last Associated
Chambers of Commerce conference asking for
reduced port charges, throws out the cold
intimation that the charges are more likely
to be increased. A comparison shows that
for a vessel of 14,553 tons gross and 9021
tons net the dues at various Australian
ports are:—
Melbourne .. .. £432 1G 5
Adelaide . . . . 407 G 4
Wellington . . . . 338 5 9
Sydney .. . . 269 19 5
Hobart . . . . 57 10 0
Taking into consideration the fact that the
biggest ships afloat can go straight into the
wharf in Hobart under their own steam, and
that the facilities for the handling and safe
storage of cargo constitute the last word in
water-front convenience, tlie Derwentside
port charges are probably the lowest in the
world.
* * * #
“FY7”: Minister Gillies has been quoting
some figures in relation to his State’s trade
in ’possum-skins which would be humorous
if they weren't so tragic. Queensland nomi-
nally has an Animals and Birds Protection
Act. but what a dead-letter it is may be
judged from the fact that in the last six
years the sale of ’possum-skins has turned in
£300.000 annually. During part of the period
under review the killing of ’possums was
prohibited at any season, so one may get an
idea of the butchery at other times. The
Minister is now amending the Protection
Act, not by increasing the penalties for de-
stroying the native fauna, but to enable him
to charge a royalty of a penny per ’possum-
skin. which is expected to bring about
£60.000 a year into the exchequer. Protec-
tion, however, is to be continued “as rigidly
as ever”! What sort of protection is it that
enabled 1.200.000 ’possum-skins to be sold in
open market in 1923 V

FOR YOU f
If the name you suggest
is adopted.
The name 'Camp Pie” appears on the register of Trade-Marks as oui
property, but the Courts recently held that we had not the exclusive right to use
it; their judgments did, however, protect us against the deliberate imitation of
our label by a certain competitor.
To protect fully the hundreds of thousands of users of “REX Camp Pie
throughout Australasia, we have decided to change the name.
We offer a cash prize of £lOO for a new name on these conditions:—
1. The name must be capable of registration as a Trade-Mark; it must
not be descriptive of the goods.
2. It must be distinctive, yet easy to pronounce.
3. For preference it should consist of not more than seven letters—a
hyphenated name is permissible.
4. The competition is open to all, except members of the staffs of Foggit,
Jones, Ltd.
5. Write clearly your suggestions (more than one may be sent by one
person if desired), attach to a “Rex Camp Pie” label, together with
competitor’s full name and address. Enclose in an envelope endorsed
“Competition for new name,” place this in another envelope addressed
*“ FOGGITT, JONES, LTD.,
Sussex Street, Sydney.
6. Competition closes December 6; prize will be awarded and result
published on or before December 31, 1924.
7. If more than one person supplies the adopted name, the prize will
be divided.
8. The decision of the Directors of the Company must be accepted as final.
In the meantime say “REX Camp Pie, and it will ensure
your obtaining the genuine article. Rex Camp Pie is made
from a secret recipe solely in our possession. It has won its
way into thousands of Australasian homes. The reason is
that the raw materials in all “Rex” products are superior to
those used in any factory in the world, and there is nothing
lacking in skill and experience in their preparation.
REX CAMP PIE is all meat —the daintiest treat cooked
ready to serve —packed in clear jelly. It is the most
economical meat meal possible to obtain.

Of just on four-score members of the Ma
State’s Uppah House, one-tenth are knights.
The “father” of the Council is Dr. Creed,
who is approaching his S2nd has
been a member since August 31, ISSS. Henry
E. Kater, just dead at S 3, was summoned to
the Council in February, 1889. His son,
Dr. Norman Kater, sits in the same
Chamber.
Old whaler William Saunders, who laid
down his fishing gear at Russell (M.L.) the
other day, was hunting right whales in the
Antarctic when Frank Bullen was sailing
in the Splendid off the M.L. coast in search
of copy for his “Cruise of the Cachalot.”
He was a crack boat-steerer in the days be-
fore the harpoon-gun took the thrill out of
the game.
Daniel Coghlan, who died, aged 84. at
Dunwich fO.) the other day. was an appren-
tice in the Mediterranean Squadron at Malta
when the late Edward Rex was a midship-
man there. Coghlan came to Bananaland
in ’65 and lived mostly in the Central-West
till ophthalmia drove him to Dunwich in ’9l.
For the last few years he had been totally
blind.
Seventy-one winters having rolled over his
bullet-like head, Major-General Charley
Ryan. K.B.E. (and half the rest of the
alphabet), has thrown in his job of Vic.
Railways Medical Officer. Dr. John Gordon,
who is greatly interested in limbless sol-
diers, takes on the soft job of requesting
searchers for employment in the Railways
to cough, please.
J. G. Aikman, who was Mayor of Mel-
bourne and a member of the Uppah Cbam-
bah a few years ago, had a paralytic seizure
recently. Because he failed to send in his
return in respect of the land he holds (about
£30,000 worth, unimproved value) the Fed-
eral Land Tax Branch sued him the other
day. Knight, P.M., thought that a nominal
fine would meet the case, and he made it a
fiver.
Dunedin (M.L.), which will' have an
international exhibition next year to fill the
chasm caused by the closing of Wembley, has
selected its general-manager and choir-
master. That both had experience of exhi-
bitions in N.B. appealed to the Scots of
Dunedin. Charles P. Hainswortli, the man-
ager, was assistant manager of two Glas-
gow shows and general-manager of another.
Paget Gale, the choirmaster, gave recitals at
two in Edinburgh in the ’eighties, and at
the big Glasca shows in 1888 and 1901.
C. E. Owen Smyth, ex-Superintendent of
Public Buildings (S.A.), is digging into the
past and supplying the local papers with
historical titbits. Smyth was a man of
quick decision. He saw two men leading a
horse with a broken fetlock. Asked where
they were taking the horse, they said “The
Zoo.” Smytli got hold of a trooper from
the adjacent police barracks and ordered
him to shoot the miserable beast. When
this was done lie said to the owners: “Now
take him to the Zoo.”
“Percy Pinktape”: A list has been made of
the occupations now being followed by the
men who lost their jobs in the Vic. police
through the strike. A good many have re-
turned to their trades; others are now publi-
cans, watchmen and salesmen ; the greatest
surprise of all—in fact, the only sur-
prise—comes when you read that one
ex-cop. is a ladies’ tailor. And quite
likely the country has lost a poor constable
and got a good dressmaker. Many a service
is improved by an earthquake.
“Emgee” (Bond.) : Re “Pulganbar’s” par.
(B. 15/5/’24) about the first issue of N.S.W.
stamps. In the British Museum is the ori-
ginal design submitted to Edward Ideas
Thompson, then (1849) Colonial Secretary.
With the drawing is a note by Deas Thomp-
son to the effect that the design and coloring
were approved of, but very justly criticising
the execution. Notwithstanding this criti-
cism the stamp went into circulation with
little or no alteration so far as the penny
issue was concerned; but the twopenny issue
showed a distinct improvement in the draw-
ing.
The Barbara Fritchie of Fitzroy is an ener-
getic old Irish lady with a detestation of “them
hooligans”—she holds up the flag the men
have hauled down in their fear of the Reillys
and other pushes which have converted the
Melbourne near-suburb into a war ax-ea.
In more than one case she has been the only
Fitzroy resident game to give evidence for
the police; and on each occasion she has ex-
plained that her husband objected. The old
lady has a sharp tongue, and is not afraid
to carry it into action every time she sees
young men loafing on the street corner or
indulging in horseplay; and Fitzroy’s tough-
est Lilioms melt away before her.
“Cwrw Bach” : Electroculture on a com-
mercial scale (B. 11/9/’24) is already an
accomplished fact. R. Borlase Matthews, in
England, uses electricity to cure hay and to
treat silage. He also guarantees at least
a 10 p.c. increase in crops by electroculture
in moist seasons, and it often reaches 50 p.c.
Owing to the difference in climate, hay-
making with electricity would hardly pay in
Australia, although a superior article would
be produced. A. Carr Bennett, of Fairfield,
lias had his electrified seeds on the market
for over two years. The benefits guaranteed
are (1) more reliable germination, (2) earli-
ness, and (3) greatly increased resistance to
adverse conditions of soil and weather and to
disease. The electric current when applied
to seed seems to have as much effect as when
applied to the growing plants.
“Ex-Dig.”: The tendency of youngsters to
find an overpowering attraction in certain
trades and callings is illustrated by the re-
port of the McCaughey trustees, who are
helping in the education of deceased soldiers’
children. Of the boys under training last
year, 189 were at engineering, and half as
many are on the way to be carpenters. Most
of the other available trades were so de-
spised that only five wanted to master brick-
laying (at which 255. per day and more is
now being earned), but eight were attracted
by plastering (which pays even better), only
four wanted to be house-painters, and three
to be stonemasons. Of the girls, 212 rushed
commercial training, and 180 dressmaking and
millinery; but the cooking business was
almost entirely neglected. And that is as
great a national misfortune as the other. Of
course, no woman eari 'cook, but another cloud
would show a silver lining if a few would
try to learn.

“I always use, Rexona
Soap. It is really excellent
for keeping the, complexion
in perfect condition, and
makes the. hair so soft and
fluffy.”
Miss ROTA CASELLI,
2 Henley Street,
Parnell, Auckland, N.Z,
Why Not Enjoy a
Complexion ?
You cannot if you do uot care for the delicate skin of the face. When you
wash your face, do you realise that it is not enough to simply remove the dirt,
but that your skin needs a soothing, healing influence to keep your complexion
fresh and free from blemish? Scented toilet soaps are often very pleasant,
but do not assert this influence, as you are well aware. Many of them contain
free alkali, which tends to dry up the skin and destroy its delicate texture.
Even the better class of such soaps do not in any way help to improve the
skin, but Rexona Skin and Facial Soap is not only an absolutely pure soap, but
is medicated on the same prin-
ciple as the famous Rexona Oint-
ment, which is famous through-
out all of Australasia as the
Rapid Healer. That is why
Rexona Soap really does for the
skin and face what cosmetics
are supposed to do, by ensuring
not only a clean face hut a pure
ami healthy skin, and thus gives
you a clear complexion.

Doherty’s Corner.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
no hush to-day at Doherty’s
corner,
Only strange green hills and the glint
of a far bay ;
Time has come like a thief and stolen the
wonder
And magic of yesterday.
There are no fairies now 7 at Doherty s
Corner,
Where dusky spider-orchids o.nd wild white
daisies grew ; „ ,
Time that stilled the heart of the singing
forest
Has stolen her fairies too.
Henderson’s hill is green at Doherty’s
Corner,
But no fairy trips in the daw’ii or the dusk
thereon;
Perhaps they died when the old black log
and the bracken
And the box bushes were gone.
They only lived, maybe, in a child’s dreaming,
For children walk in a twilit w’orld of
tlieir ow’n,
And the grown folks u r crc ever too wise to
listen
To pipes by the fairies blown.
They used to say it was wind and the bees
thrumming
Through the billow’s of bean blossom as
white as driven foam ;
Rut I knew it w r as not the wind or the
brown bees humming,
Heavily hiving home;
For I had heard such music there by the
river,
When never a reed-head rustled and every
sense was a-leap—
Under the darkened hillside the little people
Singing the world to sleep !
For I had heard such piping there in the
low light,
The queer half-light before the light of
the moon,
All the pipes of Faery playing together
Down by the old lagoon.
0 green hills, O hills with your alien faces
Fresh as August flow’ers on the grass of
an old grave,
Your witch gold has gone with the fairy
pipers’
Wood-song and elfin stave!
You are sad, O ye hills, with your faces
lifted,
Lit with a young delight to the ache of
the far skies !■
Yea, you are sad as the faith of little
children
And the sorrow of old eyes!
There’s no bush to-day at Doherty’s Corner,
No pipers will come with pipes skirling
again
To dance for me on Henderson’s hill in the
moonlight
Or cry in the fairy rain.
It’s a kind, green land at Doherty’s Corner,
And new, fair children frolic its hills
upon.
Rut once —once in the years that are half-
forgotten—
Once it w r as Avalon.
VICTORIA.
MARIE E.J. PITT.
The Rudd Family Has an Off Day.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
IT was only a few weeks to Christmas;
and Mother and Sarah had taken a
“day off,” renovating and straightening
out things in the old home. Women get
these turns every few years or so, and once
they start to execute them you never can
tell, and they never can tell themselves, what
amount of work and discomfort they’ll
create before they finish.
“Now, if that old frying-pan only had a
handle of some kind put in it,” Mother sug-
gested, holding up a utensil that Dave and
Joe had long used for melting lead to mould
bullets for the old muzzle-loader, “we could
fry things in it for a good while yet and
save the new one.”
“That ain’t a hard thing to do,” Dad
reckoned, taking the poley pan and examin-
ing it.
"Any sort of a handle w’ould do." from
Sarah, who w T as busy stripping the kitchen
shelves of accumulated rubbish. “So long
as it could be lifted on to the fire and off
again, that w T ould be all we’d want.”
“I’ll put a good one in it while I’m about
it,” Dad decided. Dad didn’t believe in
turning out cheap, shoddy work. “And a
better one than was ever in it before.”
“It couldn’t have been properly riveted
before,” Mother considered; and Mother had
handled a lot of frying-pans in her time.
“There’ll be no ribbets at all in the handle
that I put in it,” Dad remarked, shaking his
head decisively, and with some vanity.
“An' there n-n-never was any r-r-ribbets
in it,” Joe observed informatively. "Th-th-
that was the old pup-pup-pan I found at th’
sh-sh-sliepherd’s hut. He used to g-g-give
his dorg w-w-w T atter in it.”
“Shut up!” Dad commanded. “You know
too dern much, you do! An’ go an’ bring
me a piece o’ white wire that's hanging on
th’ stockyard.”
“You mustn’t always remember every-
thing,” whispered Mother, smiling kindly
upon Joe.
“I kuk-kuk-ean’t help remem”
“Get off with y'!” Dad interrupted with
a bellow’; and Joe got off and returned with
several yards of wdiite ware.
Then Dad. equipped with a file and a pair
of shoeing-pincers, sat on the well-sw T ept
ground before the kitchen door, and with the
pan between his knees began cutting the
wire and twisting it into a handle. Joe
squatted on his haunches w’atching closely.
Joe loved to squat w’atching Dad doing
things he had never seen done before. It
was a habit that developed Joe’s powers of
observation. He loved fingering and admir-
ing tools, too, that were not at the moment
being used. And when Dad put the
pincers down and took up the file, Joe would
lift them and toy with, them ; then
he’d pinch the life out of a red ant. or any-
thing of the sort that wandered his way.
And when Dad required the pincers again
lie’d have to grope all round himself in search
of them. “Here, gimme them damn things!”
he'd bark, grabbing them from doe, “an‘ let
them aloneln a second or two Joe would
stealthily reach for the file and start using
it promiscuously on the wire Dad had cast
aside, until the pincers were available again.
“Now, see here,” Dad. looking him straight
between the two eyes, threatened at last, “if
you touch them again I’ll knock your head
off.”
“It w-w-was me wh’ f-f-found them, t-too!
Joe reminded him. “Over at Ivuk-Kuk-
Carey’s.” .
Without any warning Dad opened the pin-
cers, and leaning forward seized hold of
Joe’s chubby nose with them. Joe threw
up a pair of trembling hands, closed his eyes
and opened his month, lie made no effort
to pull away, but remained still as a horse
with a twitch on its lip.
“If you don’t shut up your gab,” Dad said
to hini, “and get away from here an’ leave
things alone, I’ll pinch th’ nose right off
o’ y’.”
It was a mean, undignified advantage to
take; and Joe felt it so.
Sarah, talking about something or other,
came from the kitchen, but suddenly stopped
and burst into mirth. Then Mother bustled
out.
“Whatever are you doing to the boy?” she
remonstrated with Dad. “Do you want to
disfigure him?” ’
“It ain’t what I’m doing to him,” Dad
answered; “it’s what I’ll do to him if he
can’t mind what he ain’t told.”
Then Dad released his hold; whereupon
Joe jumped to his feet, and, looking indig-
nant and vindictive, felt his nose to make
sure it was still on.
Mother patted him sympathetically on the
head, and coaxed him into the kitchen —
“where you'll be out of the road.”
Dad worked on in silence.
“How’ll that suit y’?” he asked, entering
the kitchen with the old pan held out on the
end of a wire handle.
“Splendid!” Mother approved, taking pos-
session of the utensil and displaying it to
Sarah.
“That’s fine,” was Sarah’s verdict. “It
makes it as good as new.”
“It n-n-never was n-n-new,” Joe sneered
stubbornly. “An’ th-th-that handle’ll b-b-
-hend,” he added, “w-when the pan’s full of
chops.”
“Pshaw! I’ll make chops o’ you !” And
Dad, who held the pincers in one hand, ad-
vanced upon Joe. .Toe manoeuvred behind
the bulky form of Mother until he saw a
clear run for the door; then he hopped out.
And though he was swift as an eagle. Dad
only failed to get a piece of him with the
pincers by half an inch.
“Th’ darn young whelp!” Dad growled.
“He’s got a nopinion about everythin’.”
The women waited till Dad cooled off;
then Sarah said tactfully: “You’ve made
such a good job of the pan, Dad, what about
trying to fix these old saucepans and this
teapot?” In the art. of soft-soaping men
Sarah was becoming an experienced woman.
“It would be a big saving if you could,”
Mother said.
“Hand ’em over,” Dad answered reck-
lessly. “Bring out. everything y’ got that
wants mending.” And taking the saucepans
and teapot outside to his work-place, he sat
down to diagnose their ailments.
“Only a few 7 holes want fillin’,” he re-
flected, putting the saucepans aside. "Soon
fix them that they won't leak much.” Then,
forgetting that Joe had offended, he called
out to him cheerfully.
Joe, with his best foot in readiness for
any emergency, came cautiously round the
kitchen. "D-did y’ call m-m-me, Dad?” he
asked.
“Find me some noo nails, will y ! ?” said
Dad. “With good big heads on ’em to make
ribbets out o’.”
"N-no-noo ones, Dad?”
“An’ bring me th’ saddler's hammer out
o’ th’ knife-box.”
The saddler’s hammer was an heirloom—
a tool that only Dad himself used; and used
only when engaged in “skilled labor.” No
one else dare drive as much as a tack wirli
it; and to “lend it out" was murder!
Joe rushed first for the saddler's hammer,
because he liked handling it: then he went
off to search for the new nails.
“And here's half a dozen good pannikins,”
Sarah said, "if they had handles of some
kind to them.”
Dad looked up at the pannikins. "Yes,
leave ’em here.” he said.
Sarah placed them all round him, making
him look like a Sunday-school picnic.
“I don’t suppose,” she added, "that you
could fix handles to some poley cups.”
"Why not?” Dad answered, holding the
teapot above his head, and taking observa-
tions through the holes in the bottom of if.
“Cups,” Sarah repeated. “Wouldn’t they
break while you were fixing them?”
“Not the way I’d do it. Bring them out,
gal."
"Sarah brought the cups, and Dad looked
wisely at one.
Then Joe returned.
"Did y’ find some noo ones?”
“F-f-found some in the b-b-big barn.” Joe
answered, omitting to explain that they W’cre
nails Dad himself on the day before had
driven into the wall to hang things on. In
his knowledge of what was judicious to omit
in explanations, Joe w r as wise as a woman.
“Leave them there,” Dad said. “An’ now
see can y’ find me a thinner bit o’ wire than
thet?” —Indicating the material he had deco-
rated the frying-pan with. “Till I do one
o’ these cups for ’em. just to let ’em see.”
Off Joe went again. Dad examined some
more of the cups.
“And here's another thing which might be
mended.” Mother said, appearing with a dis-
carded quart-pot.
Dad gazed in surprise at the quart-pot. He
was astonished that we possessed such a lot
of QSS6tS
“It leaks,” sadly from Mother.
“Can soon stop th’ leakin’. Put it there
along with th’ rest.”
Mother placed it along with the pannikins.
Mother had a fine taste for matching things.
Joe returned with a length of thin wire,
and Dad filed a piece off and proceeded to
lash one of the cups with it. He lashed it

Have you any Skin Trouble ?
ALL the more stubborn and disfiguring
skin affections start off in simple
pimples, rashes and eruptions. Any
cut, abrasion, burn, etc., is liable to become infected
with the germs of ulceration or blood-poison.
Guard your skin against disease by resorting to
Zam-Buk at the least sign of trouble. Owing to its
perfect refinement and rare herbal character,
Zam-Buk quickly penetrates to the root of skin
trouble. Sinking naturally into the pores, it has a
soothing, purifying and curative influence on the
whole of the underlying tissue.
If disease has already taken root in the tissues,
there is no surer or quicker way of dislodging it
than by persistent applications of Zam-Buk. This
swiftly overcomes all sore, eruptive and inflamed
conditions of the skin. It kills the germs of eczema,
boils, abscesses, ringworm, etc., and completely
rids the tissues of poison and disease. Zam-Buk
also provides a reliable and ever-ready first-aid for
soothing and healing
cuts, wounds, burns,
scalds, scratches, abra-
sions, etc. Be sure and
keep a box of this famous
skin remedy always
handy.
Severe Eczema Healed.
“I suffered from a severe outbreak of Eczema
on my legs when in France with the A.1.F.,”
writes Mr. J. F. Hannan, 2 Hopetoun Street,
Newtown, N.S.W.
“I was treated by several skin specialists in
France and in England, but in spite of all kinds
of treatment the Eczema grew worse and I found
no relief whatever.
“I was beginning to despair of ever getting
right again when 1 thought of Zam-Buk, and after
purchasing a box I was agreeably surprised to
find that even the first application afforded some
relief. I continued the regular dressings with
Zam-Buk, and I am glad to say that within a
week the fiery irritation had disappeared and the
skin healed completely.”
Itchy Skin Rash Soothed.
Mrs. E. Patterson, of 74 Goote Street, Adelaide,
writes: “An itchy skin rash caused me dreadful
pain and disfigurement. It first appeared on my
arms, chest and back. I could not sleep at night
owing to the fiery torture. A friend advised
Zam-Buk, and it was so cooling and soothing
that through it I obtained my first night’s real
rest. Although I had wasted money on all sorts
of so-called ‘skin-cures,’ Zam-Buk was the only
thing able to banish the irritation and purify and
heal my skin.
“I also found Zam-Buk splendid for the cure
of abscesses. It brought all inflammation and
bad matter away, and healed perfectly.”

round the cup and over and under it
several times, then unlashed it and lashed it
again a different way. And all the time Joe
kept complimenting him upon his skill. “A
r-r-real good idea, D-Dad” —things like that
kept his parent in good humor.
While he was in good humor, Joe reached
noiselessly for the saddler's hammer, and
fondled it for a moment or two. Then he
took one of the new nails, with a big head on
it, and started driving it into the ground.
When Dad had mended the cup he held
it aloft in admiration and said "There y’
are!” Then he called to the women.
Mother and Sarah came out and stared at
the masterpiece. The wire was woven about
it in such a way that the mouth of the cup
was divided into four parts, and the project-
ing ends were twisted into a handle.
"Looks like a m-mu-muzzle for a d-d-dog,”
Joe chuckled.
"Yes,” Mother mused, “it will do all right.
But we couldn’t offer it to anyonie to drink
tea out of.”
“Well, let ’em drink water out of it,” Dad
grunted; and Sarah reckoned it would do
well enough.
“Well, that’s how I’ll do all the others
directly. But a bit better, o’ course,” and
with increased pride Dad turned to the tea-
pot again.
“N-n-nothin’ s-s-suc-s-s-ceeds like s-s-sucs-
s-cess, does it, Dad?” And preparatory to
aiming a hard blow with the saddler’s ham-
mer, Joe tapped the nail several times gently
on the head.
“Not unless it wer’ a parrot in a cage,”
said Dad, and smiled grimly at his own jest.
“A p-p-parrot?” Joe questioned, raising the
hammer above his head.
Dad, fumbling all round himself for the
hammer, put his thumb on the head of the
nail just when Joe delivered the blow.
Joe was as much surprised as Dad. He
dropped the hammer and tried to get on his
feet. Dad plunged the wounded thumb into
his mouth and reached for Joe with his other
hand. Joe took to his hands and knees, then
to his feet, and ran. Dad ran after him,
threatening to screw his neck if he didn’t
stop. Joe ran faster.
Then Dad gave up the chase and, return-
ing, collected liis tools. After which lie aimed
fierce kicks at the teapot and the quart-
pot and the cups and the pannikins and said,
“To Hell with them!”
STEELE RUDD.
And Sydney Was a Fair Cow.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
IT was in George-street that I first saw
them. A tall, frightened woman and
two little boys; and I knew at a glance
that they were of my own people of the bush.
Every rag they wore and every movement of
their town-weary bodies showed it plainly.
From her faded black straw hat, with its
draggled artificial flowers, to the soles of
her high-up-the-leg lace-up boots (with a thin
polish on the fronts only), she was a bush-
woman of the old school. Her dress, a faded
serge, was “a costume.” made in the days
when corsets were the fashion; and the coat
part that cocked up behind reminded me of
a sparrow's tail. Her sons were ordinary
little bush boys, in cheap galatea suits and
shapeless tweed hats. Their boots, too, were
only polished at the fronts; at the back they
were rough and furry.
I followed them closely, not from idle curi-
osity, but because I fancied they might need
a friend. And perhaps because I remembered
another little boy who 40-odd years ago was
lost with his mother in a big, strange city.
I felt sorry as I saw her gaze wistfully, and
the boys sniff hungrily, as they passed the
lavishly-apoointed tearooms, and knew* that
the woman craved for tea and the boys for
food. But those places were too grand for
the likes of them; they would be out of place
with those well-dressed people going back-
wards and forwards. And the white-capped
and -aproned waitresses would know they
were only busliies and laugh at them. Those
places were only for the toffs.
From the open door of a Chinese shop
came a familiar smell of cabbage and ripe
fruit. They would go in there and have a
cup of tea. Chinamen were always friendly
in the bush. Being unused to the noises of
the street they spoke so loudly that I easily
heard most of what they said ; and what I
did not hear I guessed—that little boy of 40
years ago said and did just the same. Be-
sides, when I got to know them later on they
told me all about it.
“Three cups er tea and sanwidges, please,
John,” she asked of the smooth-skinned
and sleek-liaired Chinee. He was used to all
kinds and sorts of people, this Celestial, and
he never quivered an eyelid as he answered:
“I am extremely sorry, madam, but we do
not serve tea here. There is a cafe a few
doors on that I can recommend. We some-
times go there ourselves.” The woman was
staggered, but said quickly, as though it
was what she had meant to say all the time:
“Well, gimme three pound er German sausage
an’ two bottles er cool drinks.” Then she
dropped the great cone of mystery with its
fat-streaked covering into the capacious craw
of a strong leather bag she was carrying,
and wherein I knew reposed no lipstick or
powder-puff, but perhaps an unbleached night-
robe, a piece of candle, a box of matches and
the money for the fares home.
After she had handed a bottle each —it was
lemonade—to the boys they shuffled out and
started their long trail up the crowded street
again; the woman next the kerb and the
boys, hand in hand, slightly in the rear,
each thirstily sucking the tin cap of the
bottle.
In the window of a sacred-picture shop was
a life-sized figure of the Redeemer. It caught
the eye of the elder boy, who wanted to know
“Who’s that. Mum?” “Come on, an’ hold
yer tongue or th’ policeman will have yer,”
threatened his mother. At that the younger
boy started to whimper. “Mum, I’m thirsty.
Why didn’t yer make that flash Pong open
the bottle?” “Come on, come on —we'll soon
be to tlv pub. anyhow,” she answered; but
I knew by the way she was gazing up this
street and down that street, and back over
her shoulder, that she had lost her bearings.
Some of the passers-by looked at them amus-
edly. some pityingly, and some did not look
at all; but all brushed past, just as the small
black ants of the bush thread their w r ay from
tree to nest and from nest to tree.
By the Town Hall she halted, thoroughly
bewildered; her shoulders sagged and her lip
quivered, and the tired little boys squatted
on the kerb. I thought to help, but at the
first wrnrd she gathered the boys and fled.
In a bit she hesitatingly approached a police-
man, a friendly-looking Irishman, whose
smiling face and twinkling blue eyes gave
her confidence. I was close enough to hear
him say: “Well, if you don’t know the name
of yer pub or the name of the man that
kapes it. I can’t fer th’ life o’ me see how
I’m goin’ to help ye!” One of the boys broke
in with: “It’s somethin’ like chewin’-gum.”
The Irishman’s eyes brightened, and his smile
broadened. “Now I git yer,” he said. “ ’Tis
Minty’s yer lookin’ for. Go straight on till
ye come to a shoeblack with a whisker an’
a strap on his hat, an' yer right at th’ dure.”
I crossed the street and by the time they
reached the hotel I was seated at the table
nearest the entrance. Nervously they crept
in. almost on tiptoe, and stood undecided.
“Sit there, please,” commanded the waitress,
pointing to some vacant seats. And there
they sat, the boys holding their hats and
the lemonade on the floor, between their feet,
and the woman with the leather bag in the
same manner. The menu, written in a
woman’s flowing hand, was jabbed in front
of her. She dabbed a blunt forefinger at
random on the card. “Will tin; boys take
the same?” asked the girl. “Yes —yes, all
th’ same, please.” T saw consternation in
the faces of the boys when the plates arrived.
“Gawd, mum,” said one, “it's rabbit! Don’t
touch it—it might er been a milky doe.”
“Might er had a bait,” hazarded the other.
So they nibbled bread and butter and sipped
water till the little boy upset the bowl of
spindly celery. Then they got up and left
hurriedly. Over my shoulder I saw the
woman tender a fl note and drop the change
into the bag without counting it.
The crowd seemed to have swallowed them :
but I was travelling south-west that night,
and when I reached the Central, there
they were. For comfort—and economy—l’d
put on an old suit and they did not recog-
nise me. Wearily they waited. The boys,
still nursing the cool-drink bottles, were
chewing the dry German sausage. Chew —
chew—chew: a pause, and then a gulp.
They were thirsty and said so, and they had
to hold the food in the mouth till it
moistened enough for them to swallow it. I
knew that those tin caps still had them
baffled; but I did not dare to again offer
assistance.
“Mum, what about a drink?” pleaded
one. “There orter be water somewhere.”
“Wait a minit. There’ll be plenty in tli’
train. We might miss it if we move,”
warned the woman. “Or yer might git lost
or run over or something.” Every man
that wore buttons and peaked caps she
asked: “If yer please, is this where th’
Gundagai train starts from?” Some of them
she asked twice or three times. And when
the train did pull in she had to ask three
men to make sure.
“Don't whistle!” she told one of the boys;
“they mightn’t like it.”
“I ain’t whistlin’,” he said; “I’m only
blowin’ —th’ sossidge is burnin’ me mouth.”
And then they got their seats, and the
muscles of the woman’s face relaxed like
magic; the strained, fearsome look left her
eyes; she was 10 years younger in as many
minutes. It was a transformation such as
I had seen on a face only once, and that
was the face of a young mother when, re-
ferring to the limp body of an infant on a
shabby bed, a doctor had said: “The crisis is
past—he’ll be all right now.”
The boys made for the water-bottle, ana
when the order “Take your seats, please,
came, I slipped into a corner in their
compartment. The younger boy was beside
me, and later on, when the night became
colder and I threw my rug across the knees ot
both of them, the woman suddenly recog-
nised me. . ,
“Why, ain’t you th’ man that was S
ter speak to me in th’ street yesterday -
slip asked.
“Yes, and I seen him havin’ his tea at the
pub,” put in one of the boys. “Yer know,
mum thought you was one of them pick-
pocket blokes.”
“Anyhow,” said mum, “I’m glad you
wasn’t. Goin’ shearin’? Well, harvestin
then? My boss—me husband, I mean—is
share-eockyin’ near Gundagai. Yer might
get a start with him. One of me boys have
crook eyes, an’ I’ve just had him down ter
Sydney seein’ a speshlist. But it cost a lot,
an’ I’m glad to be on me way home again.
No, I was sorry—I wasn’t going shearing
or harvesting. I was just going anywhere,
and I would leave them at Harden.
After that we had meatpies and coffee at
Goulburn. I carried the feast to the car-
riage, and before we had finished eating the
train pulled out. The woman was alarmed.
“What erbout th’ cups an’ things?” she
asked. “Won’t they want ’em back? They
might think we pinched them.” I explained
how we could leave them at the next refresh-
ment rooms we stopped at, and so on, with
the remittance of the deposit I had left for
them.
“Well, now, that’ll tell yer,” she said.
“That’s a wrinkle worth knowin’.”
When day broke, bright and sunny, the
boys gazed in ecstasy from the windows.
“Look at the rabbits! A bloke ’d make a
quid a day here trappin’. Look, mister, at
that crop er wheat there: it’ll go 20 bags to
th’ acre. And that mob er cows all pig fat.”
They were on their own dustheap. so to
speak; and the bush was an open book to
them. The woman, who had not moved nor
closed her eyes all night, smiled placidly, for
the glitter of the dew on the fence wires,
the sombre green of the cypress-pines and
the gums, and the blessed calm of the great
bush were far more to her than the glitter
of the jewels in the windows, the pretty
dresses and the glaring lights of the big city.
As I said good-bye at the window after we
reached Harden she asked if I didn’t mind
would I please make sure that this train
did go to Gundagai. “And don’t forget if
ever you’re up our way be sure and come
and see us. We won't forget all yer kind-
ness.”
As the smaller of the boys reached far out
the window to meet my hand, I ventured:
“You don’t like Sydney, do you, sonny?”
“No,” he answered. “It’s a fair cow.
Even the Pongs go about in their Sundee
clothes.”
