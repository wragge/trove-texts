1 Ac green bush mantles your shoulder,
The blue wave washes your feet •
There be greater cities and older,
Hut never a city so sweet.
By gardens sloped to the water,
By clean towers built for pride,
You were born for an Empire's daughter.
And bred for an ocean's bride!
By every sun-browned maiden
1 hat laughs on your low sea-beach,
By your tanned Apollos laden
With all that your long waves teach,
By each clasp in your diamond splendor,
By each kiss in your diamond cove,
You were made for the passionate tender
Embrace and avowal of love! ]
By the banks of your rippling river,
And the eamping-ground in the trees,
You were made for ever and ever
For love and laughter and ease.
For sunlit hours on the water,
For soft hands trailed in the foam,
7? moon on the heeling quarter,
When the white sea-wings come home!
Not a ship that rocks in your fairway,
Not a liner lashed to your quays,
a war-gig chained to your stairway
But has brought from the outmost seas
borne heart that will soon grow tender
lo your charm of beach and grove,
And go sadly forth from your splendor
would leave his love!
BLACK WINGS.
Sextons of the Overland! Buriers of the
dead.
Whose graves are lone and shallow and
winding sheets are red!
Wardens of the waggon track. watchers by
the creek,
Loiterers in the lignum, where the blacksoil
traps the weak!
Feasters at the wayside, guests at the
lagoon,
Gloating over dead sheep rotting in the
noon !
Robbers on the red roads, highwaymen of
Brought,
Settlers of the issue that the dawn has left
m doubt!
Was there ever team-horse from the chains
let go,
Was there ever lean steer lightened of the
bow ,
But your hungry vanguard drifting from the
sky
Croaked beside his shoulder, glad to watch
him die?
Ever tramped our cattle knee-deep in the
grass,
But you soared above them praying Death to
pass?
Ever went our sheep-mobs starvedly and
slow,
But you marked their weaklings stumbling
to and fro?
Ever trod a bushman, tramp or pioneer,
U er the plains of Famine, through the scrubs
of Fear,
But darker than his danger, closer than his
dread,
Shadows on his pathway, flapped ye over-
head?
Call to mind the stock routes north and west
and east! —
Every heap of white bones fashioned you a
feast!
Call to mind the sandhills!—every wrinkled
hide
Made your perch at banquet the day a dumb
beast died!
Surely, at God's muster, when our mobs
again
Trample through the star-grass up the
purple plain,
When from creek and sandhill crowd our
western dead,
He shall suffer only white wings overhead!

And the white stars beckon without a word

Of a hidden leader, the oak-trees break
Into sibilant music, one and all;
And every pine has a harp to wake,
And every gidyea a tune to call.
Then the bridle-path that was dumb and
drear
Rings with an elfin music clear,
And the shimmering starlight wraps us
round
With a cloak of passion, a robe of sound.

There is never a sweet-throat singer in
sight
I wix't the sombre earth and the silver skies.

And it swells in a rolling splendid tide,
Till the night with its rosy warmth is lit
And the cold, grey Bush is a-throb with it.

Verses, ’ by Will Ogilvie (Fraser, Asher,

Haroy
A new volume by Thomas Hardy 1 This
would be in literature an event comparable
only to the discovery of a hitherto unpub-
lished novel by Meredith. But A Changed
Man and Other 'Tales (Macmillan) is not
a new .piece of work. It is but a reprint of
a dozen minor novels that have seen light
in various periodicals. Hardy’s last novel,
Jude the Obscure, appeared in 1895, for The
Well-Beloved, which was published in book
form in 1897, had appeared serially in 1892.
After that Hardy was silent in prose. Of
these minor novels only three were published
since Jude—A Changed Man, The Grave by
the Handpost, and Enter a Dragoon: the rest
represent earlier work, and the best of
them, The Romantic Adventures of a Milk-
maid (1883), was written before The Mayor
of Casterbridge. From such chronological
considerations we ard enabled to discover that
Hardy ceased writing prose simply because
he could no longer write fiction. A Changed
Man is a narrative of matter-of-fact dulness;
The Grave by the Handpost is one of “Life’s
Little Ironies” in which the irony seems un-
necessarily perverse; and in Enter a Dra-
goon the mechanism of the tragi-comedy is too
obviously contrived. In these three late efforts
Hardy’s invention is seen running thin. He
was wise to make his retirement from the
fiction stage.
There is in all these stories a conception
of . I ate that is outrageously pessimistic.
“Life’s Big Ironies” they might have been
aptly entitled. The Waiting Supper, con-
temporaneous with The Woodlanders, tells
of two parted lovers, throughout whose lives
Fate intervenes again and again at the very
moment when their happiness seems assured.
While the Afroman is waiting for the arrival
of her lover, with the supper prepared for
their wedding, news comes that her husband,
supposed to be dead, is on his way to claim
her. But though he has sent his luggage on,
he does not arrive. Nothing is heard of him
thereafter, yet the two lovers are afraid to
carry out the twice-postponed marriage. They
grow old waiting; and then the skeleton of
her husband’s body is found beneath a water-
fall. the trysting-place of the two unhappy
lovers.
“To think,” said Nicholas, “how we visited
him I How we sat over him, hours and
hours, gazing at him, bewailing our fate,
when all the while he was ironically hissing
at us from the spot, in an unknown tongue,
that we could marry if we chose! You
might have married me on the day we had
fixed, and there would have been no impedi-
ment. You would now have been seventeen
years my wife, and we might have had tall
sons and daughters Well—is it still bet-
ter late than never?”
But they are too old to rnarry. “Is it
worth while, after so many years?” she said
to him.
But occasionally he ventured to urge her
to reconsider the case, though he spoke not
with the fervor of his earlier years.
J*
It is clear from these stories that Hardy
could never have been a master of the modern
short story. Nearly all the tales in this
resurrected collection begin cumbrously.
They are mere skeleton plots of novels that
he might have written. Thus one story be-
gins :
We had been talking of the Georgian
glories of our old-fashioned watering-place,
which now, etc The writer, quite a
youth, was present merely as a listener.
±fie conversation proceeded from general
subjects to particular, until old Mrs. H—
whose memory was as perfect at 80 as it had
ever been in her life, interested us all by the
obvious fidelity with which she repeated a
storv many times related to her by her
mother when our aged friend was a girl—a
domestic drama much affecting the life of an
acquaintance of her said parent, one Madem-
oiselle V , a teacher of French, etc.
Lut there is one riovelette, occupying one-
fourth of the book, which, written in 1883,
gives us Hardy at his best. This is The
Romantic Adventures of a Milkmaid, a de-
lightful story in Hardy’s finest vein of tragi-
comedy, colorful, romantic, ironically humor-
ous. The matter-of-fact milkmaid intrudes
upon a mysterious Baron at a moment when
he had determined to take his own life. Her
mere presence lifts the cloud of melancholy
from his mind, and gratefully he offers to
give her any “treat” she wishes. The one
thing she asks is to go to a public ball. The
Baron, by an elaborate scheme, arranges to
take her, gives her lessons in the then new
dance, the polka, provides for her the proper
dress, and escorts her to the ball. On their
return, she changes into her old clothes, and
the Baron thereupon calmly builds a fire and
destroys the gorgeous garments in which he
had arrayed her. But the glimpse into an-
other life that had been thus miraculously
afforded the milkmaid changes her whole out-
look ; and just here the Baron learns with
dismay that the girl has all the while been
engaged to marry an honest lime-burner.
Also, the milkmaid has fallen in love with
himself. Upon these pegs Hardy hangs a pretty
comedy of sentiment. The Baron is the
unwitting cause of the girl failing to go to
the church cm her wedding day. lie does
his best to put things right; but fails—for
the milkmaid now refuses to wed her swain ;
and onlv by a pretty bit of "plotting does the
Baron make her marry the But
this solution, too, is equally futile, for the
milkmaid refuses to live with her husband.
Once again the Baron intervenes, and this
time the romance comes to its predestined
happy ending. Altogether a delightful piece
of sentimental comedy.
The collection will hot reveal Hardy in
any new light, but indubitably it contains a
faithful exposition of Hardy’s conception of
Fate, and here and there one finds examples
of character-drawing and of landscape that
could be done by no hand but that of our
last surviving master of prose fiction.
We should like to see more of More Aus-
tralian Songs for Young and Old (George
Robertson, Melb.), words by Annie R. Ren-
toul, music by Georgette Peterson, illustra-
tions by Ida S. Rentoul-Outhwaite. The
words are occasionally too difficult for little
singers, but frequently, as in “The Boom-
erang, they allow for the action necessary
for laddies. The first verse runs
/ wonder if you've ever seen the boomerang fly
Like a curly caterpillar all across the sky '
O it swoops and out it swoops, and back it
always comes
Right to where it started looping loops
among the gums.
Whoo-oomp !
Back it always comes,
L nless it hits a cockatoo or parrot in the
gums!
The music is pleasantly humorous and
properly simple; and the illustrations are
works of art, full of sprightlv- fancy.
The series of genteel triflings with litera-
ture, entitled Bays with the Great Novelists,
Bays with- the Victorian Poets, also. With
the English Poets, and With the Lyric Poets
(Idodder and Stoughton, per Angus and
Robertson, Sydney) are fully illustrated in
color and nicely printed. The scope of the
works is indicated by the fact that the
great novelists” include only George Eliot,
Dickens and Thackeray, while the “English
poets comprise merely Tennyson, Byron
rpwniog. As gift books, however, they
lulfu their innocuous purpose.
R-e George Lambert’s work in the recent
exhibition of the International Society, Lon-
*-G Athenaeum regards his portrait
or Mr. Cunninghame Graham as “a triumph
ot compact and self-sufficient statement. Its
completeness suggests finality, as though
along that particular road the painter could
hardly progress further.” Iu another por-
trait the critic finds the head “really badly
painted, emerging harsh and flat, without
the subtlety of silhouette which alone could
excuse such a contrast from the elaborate
background. Yet that background is splendidlv
painted in itself. There is no more beauti-
ful pigment in the exhibition.”
Two Humorists
Stephen Leacock, one of our few new
humorists, betrays signs of weariness. Be-
hind the Beyond, and Other Contributions
to Human Knowledge (Lane, per Sydney
Book Club), is brilliant in patches. The title
piece, a burlesque of the modern problem
play, is perfectly done. This sort of thing:
“In this expectant hush, a man in a check
tweed suit walks on the stage ; only one man.
one single man. Because if he had been
accompanied by a chorus, that would have
been a burlesque; if four citizens in toeas
had been with him, that would have been
Shakespeare; if two Russian soldiers had
walked after him, that would have been
melodrama. But this is none of these. This
is a problem play. So he steps in alone, all
alone, and with that absolute finish of step,
that ability to walk as if—how can one ex-
press it? —as if he were walking, that betrays
the finished actor.”
In the other sketches the humor is rather
hectic.
Jt
A great humorist was lost to the world
when circumstances made of James Edmond
a great editor. The mere fact that he
became the wittiest of living editors hardly
makes up for the loss suffered by the thin
ranks of world-humorists. From time
to time, however, James Edmond has escaped
from the leading strings of his editorial
columns, and given us stories and verse
that are unadulterated humor. These the
Platypus Press, Bathurst-street, Sydney, has
collected into a fat volume bearing the title
A Journalist and Two Bears, llis humor
almost escapes classification, §o unexpected
it is, so unhampered by rules and regula-
tions. But it may be defined as the quintes-
sence of pure fun. There is no wit in this
collection, for wit is hard and brilliant and
cold ; this is clean and pellucid humor, genial
and unconfined, the product of a pen that
Hots and rambles at his grotesque will, and
without formulae or method finds humor in
places where no other writer has ever
thought of seeking it before. Yet it would
be wrong to say that Edmond seeks his
humor ; it bubbles up inexliaustively from a
perennial spring; and, as we are mixing our
metaphors without the happy results that
accrue when some of Edmond’s characters
mix their drinks, we may add that his humor
captures his pen and carries it along iiresist-
ibly until the ink is exhausted with laughter-
Some of these stories are tales, others have
no room for any plot, the whole available
space having been pre-empted by humor.
Even his dreams have a grim, purposeless
humor that never comes to other writers.
Here is a slab from one of his dreams. He
found himself descending to the bottom of
Infinity, and he was going down for cen-
turies :
“I walked steadily on at the same pace.
In all the millions of years I had been walk-
ing I had never met anybody, and I knew
somehow that in all Futurity I never would
meet anybody. I never heard anything, either,
and I wms perfectly well aware that I never
would hear anything. I knew that I was
going nowhere except to more passages, each
one just the same as the last, and just the
same as the next. I was aware, somehow or
other, that the ghost who had died before
me was walking along at exactly the same
steady pace as myself in some other passage
countless miles ahead, and that the ghost
who had died just after me was doing his
ceaseless tramp countless miles behind, and
that the ghost who had died after him was
on the spiral staircase, and would get to the
first Passage by-and-bve. I knew, also, that
the ghost behind would never catch up to
me so that we might be two ghosts together
and keep each other company, and I knew
equally well that I would never catch up to
the ghost in front, but neither fact troubled
me to any extent. We would all walk apart
like this for all Eternity, and that fact
whollv failed to interest me. So I went on
walking, and the silence continued in full
blast, and the light at the'end of the passage
was always ahead, and whether there was a
similar lieht behind me I did not know, for
T never looked back. I could have looked back
if it had Struck me to do so, but I never did.”
The trouble is that J-ames Edmond n o s
sesses an imagination. No one would object
to that if Edmond’s imagination was a tame
and grocer-like imagination ; but the imagin-
ation that got loose in these stories is a sort
of super-imagination that isn’t safe with the
ordinary.citizen. The book should be allowed
out only to people with well-oiled risible
faculties. The effect of “The ltow in Our
Boarding House” upon a cprate or a member
of the Stock Exchange would be catastro-
phic. Quite respectable persons in congrega-
tions would be seriously injured by the flying
fragments of an exploded curate who hap-
pened to think of “The City of Eree Drinks”
during matins, while the popping noise of ex-
ploding members of Stock Exchanges, who
glanced at “The Girl in the Turkish Bath”—
the first thing a member of the Stock Ex-
change would glance at —would seriously in-
terfere with the business of the country. By
the way, “The Baseless Fabric of the City
of Free Drinks,” begins in the maddest way
that any respectable story ever began. There
are of places and people in these
stories that remain unforgettable. There was
Bildad, where “The Curse of the Lost
Soul Mine” vegetated :— ■'
“Nothing ever happens at Bildad’s Creek,
or if it does, nobody ever wakes in time to
see it. Now and then, perhaps, a slate is
blown off the roof of the little church —‘the
only building in sight which seems to have
been roofed at all except by accident—but
though the inhabitants as a whole are well-
disposed towards the Christian faith, they
invariably let it lie. Possibly they indulge
a faint hope that it may one day be blown
on again, but this seldom takes place.”
But there is more than humor in this book.
One turns from the brilliance of the riotous
"City of Free Drinks,” the “shriek” that is
entitled ‘“The Wrongs of the Girl in the
Bath,” the delightful account of
Ihe Unspeakable Turk,” and the heroic
story of ‘Barrios, Consul for Galatia”: one
even turns from the “The Autobiography of
a Cannibal,” in which a murderer disposes
of the body by the haopy expedient of eating
him-;—•
“I lived on him for the next fortnight till
he was all gone. I hunted up an old gridiron
and a saucepan, and cooked him in all sorts
° • ) va^s ’. he was best when I fried him
with onions. Roasted he was insipid, and
lie made the worst stew I ever tasted, but
grilled he was not at all bad. I got tired of
him at last, but I kept looking forward to
the time when he would be finished, and
then I would go back to civilisation and
enjoy a club dinner once more, and that kept
me up.”
Apd the subsequent confusion in the mind
of the condemned murderer wdiether it was
himself or the man he had iacorpoi’ated in
luniselt who was going to be executed —we
turn from these outbursts of sheer humor to
the underlying idea in “The Fool and his
Inheritance,” the humorous grimness of “The
Great Experiment,” and that feat of imagi-
nation connected with “The Three Skele-
tons.” Wells, even, could not have worked
out these remarkable hypotheses with more
convincing detail.

Two Popular Models ®
'here are two popular Winchester .22 Caliber
Repeating Rifles, either one of which gives
first class satisfaction for target shooting or hunting
small game. They are the Model 1903 .22 Automatic
and the Model 1906. The first, as its name implies, is
reloaded by recoil. After its 10-shot magazine is filled
and the rifle once loaded, the only effort required to
shoot it is to aim and pull the trigger. On account of the
ease and novelty of its operation, there is no end of fun
shooting this rifle. It’s the peer of all .22s. The Model 1906
is a handsome, well-made, fine-shooting, smooth-working gun.
It is a handy little piece which has no equal in gun value. It
has a 20-inch, round barrel, fitted with sporting front and ad-
justable rear sights. It shoots .22 Short, .22 Long and .22
Long Rifle Cartridges, which permits the use of light ammu-
nition for target work and heavier cartridges for game shoot-
ing. These rifles are Take-Downs, and come apart easily
and quickly and can be packed in a small compass.
WINCHESTER CARTRIDGES. Whichever one of these
rifles you select, use Winchester make of cartridges in it.
They develop the possibilities of Winchester and other
makes of rifles and revolvers to the fullest degree. Get
the kind with the big W on the box.

A Picture of
Good Health!
Mrs. ADDINGTON, of Argent Street, Broken
Ilill, writes her daughter was cured of St. Vitus’s
Dance, and is NOW IN SPLENDID HEALTH
through CLEMENTS TONIC.
“Argent Street, North Broken Hill,
“10th October, 1911.
“CLEMENTS TONIC LTD.
“Some years ago my daughter, in alighting from
a tram, had a severe fall. It gave her a great
shock, and so affected her nervous system that
eventually St. Vitus’s Dance ensued. She became
so bad that it was impossible to hold a knife or
fork, and going out of the house was impossible.
“I was persuaded to try CLEMENTS TONIC. She gradually improved, and
soon regained her normal condition. Nearly two years have elapsed SINCE HER
COMPLETE RECOVERY, and all that time she has enjoyed the best of health.
“I have great faith in CLEMENTS TONIC, and always recommend it. You
can make what use you wish of this.
“(Signed) (Mrs.) R. A. ADDINGTON.”
CLEMENTS TONIC is Your MEDICINE
The Rev. JOHN lIOSKING, D.D., Minister of
the Congregational Church, Fitzroy, Melbourne,
writes:—•
“I was completely run down and suffered by
nervous prostration, being troubled with Insomnia
and nervous headaches.
“After taking one bottle I slept soundly, and soon
got stronger. One bottle put me right, and was
worth its weierht in gold. I recommend this medi-
cine very strongly. You may use this as you think
fit.
“(Signed) JOHN HOSKING, D.D.”
This Testimony should convince anyone suffering
from INSOMNIA or LOSS OF SLEEP and
NERVOUS BREAKDOWN, of the value of this
curative medicine.

A Sea Picture.
I wandered on the lonely beach to-day.
The sea was grey, the sky not wholly blue.
Above my head the clamorous sea-gulls flew,
And sleekly hovered watching for their prey,
Then outward wheeled, the sun upon their
wings.
I vainly searched the wrack for garnerings,
Yet nought found I than bitter, dead sea
fruit,
Hope’s wreckage washed upon the shifting
sand..
A vague, chill mist ascended from the land,
The sea wind dropped and suddenly was
mute,
And faintly gold, the last pale ray of light
Was flung across the melancholy sea,
Where one ship trailed its black smoke list-
lessly,
And onward crept into the darkening night.

Sunset on Mount Arapiles.
Arapiies ! Arapiles !
Old mountain of the years
When surges swung with hammer-blows
Against thy basalt tiers:
Arapiles ! Arapiles !
Upon thy bannered brow
The sunset’s glory helio's
God’s Manhood-Message now!
Upon thy crest at sunset-time
Is flashed in lines of fire
This Word of God’s, heart-magical:
“Be strong! Be true! Aspire!”
Be not cast down in bitterness —
80, on these western tiers
God writes Australia’s horoscope
Through all the coming years !
Arapiles ! Arapiles !
Thou mountain of the storm-
When on thy seaward bastions
The breakers swung enorme ;
Arapiles ! Arapiles !
Before Australia came
Up from the depths, thy mountain-head
Was veiled with bannered flame!
When all the golden Wimmera
Lay deep beneath the sea,
God set thee here, inscrutable
In sunset-panoply!
Thou wert an Isle mysterious—
Last of these mountain-tiers
That ring this White Man’s Continent
In these war-sliadowed years !
Arapiles ! Arapiles !
From Kosciusko’s snow
Thou wert the last Lone Island in
Your Archipelago;
Arapiles! Arapiles!—-
’Neath what dim moon and star,
Wert thou the sea-girt resting-place
For storm-birds blown afar?
Ere Athens and Lacedaemon
Had heard the trumpets blow.
Or Greek had drained exultantly
The cup of Yaphio;
Ere Christ came up from Bethlehem
Or Rome owned slave or thrall,
Thou wert the last sea-citadel —
The first Lone Land of all!
Arapiles ! Arapiles !
Whilst Carthage rose, and fell
God flung His sunset radiance
On thy lone pinnacle ;
Arapiles! Arapiles!—
When Suffetes in their pride
Rowed forth of yore to Sicily.
Thy crest was splendor-dyed !
Dodona’s oaks were whispering,
And Delphi’s murmured low,
When thou wert veiled, all-consecrate
With God’s own sunset-glow!
All silver-limbed and beautiful,
Allured by cloud and tree,.
Lone Altar-Isle, what Paphian
Came forth of yore to thee?
Arapiles ! Arapiles !
The sea-depths leap no more;
Beneath thy sunset-panoply
The drums of threshers roar!
Arapiles! Arapiles!
These strong Australian arms
Have filled the golden Wimmera
With villages and farms !
The sleepless mills at Natimuk
And Horsham take their fill,
The ploughshare tames the wilderness
From Dooen unto Nliill!
This is Australia’s heritage—
This golden sea of grain ;
Alas! upon thy mountain-head
I see no thankful fane!
Arapiles ! Arapiles !
They walk in formal shrouds,
And none behold thy mystery—
Thy pageant of the clouds !
Arapiles ! Arapiles !
The wheat rolls wave on wave ,
Who reads thy story cosmical—
Sea-carved on cliff and cave?
When sunset lights thy battlements
With burnished shields of fire.
None see the mighty Over-God — •
Men’s thoughts are in the mire!
Like blind things in thine ocean-depths
. Of yore, they grope in slime ;
I see thine Archipelago
Rise starkly out of Time!
Arapiles ! Arapiles !
Old mountain of the years.
Thou art my pagan altar-place.
With thy sea-sculptured tiers !
Arapiles ! Arapiles !
Upon thy bannered brow
God’s sunset-glory helios
True mankind's message now !
This Word of His, most magical—
“Be strong! Be true! Aspire!”—
Upon thy crest at sunset-time
Is flashed in pillared fire:
A rapiles ! Arapiles !
Lo, on thy western tiers , .
I see Australia's Destiny
Blaze down the coming years!

How to Address Letters;
Correspondents to The Bulletin would oblige the
paper (and, to an extent, themselves) by talcing some
care as to methods of address.
Business letters (with regard to subscriptions, ad-
vertisemenls, etc.) should in no case be addressed to
the Editor, but to the Manager. To send them to
the Editor is to invite inattention.
It- is not a good thing to address editorial letters
to anyone by name. “The Editor, The Bulletin,” is
the proper superscription for ‘•copy.” Delay, and
even loss, is sometimes caused by addressing to per-
sons instead of officials. The person may not be
there; the official always is.
Special Notice.
Insufficiently stamped letters are liable to be re-
fused.
The contents of this paper are copyright by the
publishers. The right to reproduce or translate any
part of the contents of this number is hereby ex-
pressly reserved by the publishers.
The Editor will carefully read, and, ivhere prac-
ticable, acknowledge in tiie ‘‘Correspondence” col-
umn all contributions submitted, whether in the form
of Political, Social or other Articles, Verse, Short
Tales or Sketches (those dealing with Australian sub-
jects, and not exceeding two columns in length, or,
say, SOOO words, are specially acceptable), Paragraphs,

ivill be regarded as strictly confidential.
The Bulletin will return all unsuitable MS. when
the address is specified and stamps are enclosed. But
no MS. will be returned, or preserved, unless these
conditions are observed. When MS. is forwarded
without., stamps for return it will be understood that
the copy is to be destroyed if not acceptable. Per-

THE KEY NIGGER.
On a recent day Governor-General Denman,
usually regarded as a rather level-headed
person, despite his cocked hat of office,
offered Australia the proposition that “India
is really the key of the Empire.” It is an
elusive suggestion, and he who pursues it
with a view to putting the salt of definition
on its tail is likely to have a long chase.
If it is meant that Australia and other
white sections of the Empire depend on their
brown brother for land defence, and must
go to irrecoverable pot without him, past
history shows no evidence to that effect. No
Hindu army ever saved London of any other
important white centre, and though the gar-
ish Benjamin Disraeli once called a
handful of turbaned troops to Europe by
way of bringing pressure to bear on Russia,
they didn’t look sufficiently formidable to
terrify anybody. The effect produced by
that handful of warriors was that Britain
was denounced as a Power which had re-
vived the idea of letting colored barbar-
ians loose on a white population—a thing
that hadn’t been seriously attempted since
the day when a depraved Sultan sent the
hordes of Egypt into Greece. If it is pre-
sumed that, should Britain lose India and
some other Power acquire it, that other
Power will thereby get so much money and
such overwhelming fleets that all will be
finished with the Bull Empire—well, the
world has waited a long time for India to
start its career of marine conquest, and it
is still waiting. Furthermore, it has seen
the Lascar at sea, and hasn’t found him
very serviceable. India isn’t much of a
place to borrow money from. It isn’t a key
of empire in the sense that its loss would
seriously interrupt communication, for the
big liners that run from Canada, South
Africa, Australia and Maoriland —the white
dependencies which really count —to Eng-
land have no use for the old place at all.
The site has some value as a source of
Bull’s food supply, and it returns fair in-
terest on a certain amount of Bull capital,
though in this latter respect its future im-
portance is doubtful. As a usurer the mild
Hindu is beginning to learn too much.
* * * *
In the garish early days of John Com-
pany England made itself rich out of India
by plain robbery. Nowadays there isn’t
much robbery. India uses up a large pro-
portion of the scanty white army which may
yet be badly needed for the defence of Eng-
land itself. It is fruitful in border scraps,
and on its frontier was raised the great
Russian invasion bogey which helped to
make many complications in Europe, and to
muddle Britain into disastrous alliance with
the Unspeakable Turk. It has furnished,
incidentally, many costly interior wars, also
the great Mutiny. It supports less than
100,000 British people, apart from soldiers,
and the British population is declining. It
isn’t in the same street, nor even in the
same town, with Australia or Canada, as a
shipowner. If India is a key it is a badly
discolored one, and considering how small
a hold Bull has on the motley tinted Em-
pire the key is in dubious hands. The day
when foreign complications necessitate the
withdrawal of the bulk of the scanty white
force Hindustan promises to be the burial-
place of a heap of British prestige. There
is glamor and pomp and legend about the
country of the Moguls and the Mahrattas.
It is a big place, and contains much scenery
and many curious faiths and quaint
old temples and mysteries and gods and
snakes and fakirs and materials for Kip-
lingesoue romance, and many notable battle-
fields lie within its borders. But these things
don’t of necessity make it pay as a White
Man’s Burden.
* * * *
The alleged key has become more than
usually troublesome of late. It stands for
the biggest, noisiest and most dissatisfied
colored element in an empire that is mostly
colored. It even stands for more than half
the population of the Empire. It has been
taught a lot of British history and many
British theories of government, and as
some of it has a superficial capacity for
European knowledge it thinks this know-
ledge gives it the right to snread its people
over all other parts of the Empire. It begins
to talk likewise of its right to self-govern-
ment, which can hardly be refused for all
time unless John Bull burns “Mill on
Liberty,” and cuts the history of Charles
I. out of the Indian school books. _ And it
begins to hint very broadly that it is absurd
to suppose that the biggest half of the Em-
pire’s population will lje content for ever
without a share in the control of the Em-
pire, which control would signify the end of
Bull as a great white imperial proposition.
Under British training the land of Hind
threatens to become too big to be held down,
and it is certainly too big to be let up.
A man with an ordinary elephant may be
boss, but a man with an elephant to which
he has imnarted the secrets of how to be
boss is in danger of being trodden upon. At
present Bull shows a tendency to compro-
mise. He isn’t sure that he is strong enough
to sit down hard on his too-much educated
and too multitudinous nigger, nor will his
Nonconformist conscience quite allow him
to do so. He isn’t prepared to let his nigger
sit on him. But he is half-inclined to split
the difference by proposing that the nigger
shall be permitted to sit on dependencies
like South Africa and Fiji and Mauritius
and perhaps Australia, as something to go
on with. This is rough on these countries
which have never gained anything by the
Indian connection, but then Bull is up
against a difficult situation.
Our colored brother of the Ganges is com-
plicated He owns one of the richest coun-
tries on earth, and it is so thinly peopled
that it can not only feed itself but also
show a great surplus of food for export.
Still the Hindu, by reason of his primitive
hand-power methods, remains deadly poor.
So he yearns to swarm away from his own
country and become rich abroad, as his
ideas of riches go. When he strikes a coun-
try like Fiji, or Natal, or Mauritius, where
a fairly numerous white community has in-
troduced improved methods, he is capable
of assimilating these methods —so long, at
least, as he has the white man to copy from
—to a certain extent. He becomes a bloated
capitalist, as he understands bloated capital,
and multiplies like a rabbit. A't the same
time, though he earns large wages, as com-
pared with the standards of his own coun-
try, while acting as a parasite on the white
man’s civilisation, he is so cheap according
to European standards that he immediately
begins to elbow the white man out. He is
doing that in India, though there, of course,
the European settler never had any real
hold. He is doing it in Fiji and Mauritius,
where the European thought himself fairly
’■'-'ll anchored. He is beginning to do it in
Natal, where the European had reckoned
himself for very many years lord of the
soil. Presumably when he has completely
eHen up the white man’s industrial system
in these places he will sink to his old Hindu
level. He will be like the white ant which
has finished eating its tree. There is no
reason why, left to his own efforts and with-
out a higher order of things to prey upon,
he should do any better in Natal or Fiji or
Mauritius than in his rich old peninsula,
especially considering that many of his best
achievements there have been due to Euro-
pean influences. The complaint against the
Indian immigrant is that, wherever he has
gone, he has introduced a lower, dirtier,
worse ventilated end worse drained type of
civilisation, and has begun to elbow out a
better civilisation by sheer cheapness. He
has an infernal capacity for always moving
to countries where there is a higher culture
which he can devour. He never goes where
there is only a meaner race to be elevated.
Aboriginal Africa or Australia or Polynesia
had no attractions for him. Pioneering was
never in his line.
India to-day is in a special ferment be-
cause it isn’t allowed to consume such white
progress as has been built up in South
Africa. Its clamor about its alleged right
to spread itself wherever it feels inclined,
and the wobbling attitude of British politi-
cians who are afraid to say one thing or
another, threatens to seriously undermine
the loyalty of the South African white popu-
lation. India thus becomes a conundrum.
If the gentle brown man gets even half
what he demands in the one matter of his
claim to pervade the Empire, there will pro-
bably be very little empire left. If he
doesn’t get it he will be too dissatisfied to
live with, and if he is temporised with he
will be too inflated to be manage-
able. Meanwhile much of the worry of
British foreign policy consists in the
struggle to protect the sea route that leads
to this disgruntled dependency. Gibraltar
and Cyprus and Egypt and Aden all repre-
sent cne costly phase or another of the effort
to prevent Ram Dass’s postal communica-
tion with the land he so greatly reviles be-
ing cut off. Taking all things into account,
India might make a good Christmas present
for an enemy.
STATE RIGHTS IN DISEASE.
Tiie chief obstacle in the way of dealing
promptly and effectively with preventable
diseases in Australia is the identical old
obstacle which gets in the road of uniform
railway gauges, monorails, the drastic con-
trol of food trusts, decentralisation of ports,
immigration, and most of the other things
which the country needs urgently. It is
an obstacle called State Rights by persons
with plenty of time to be polite; but those
who butt up against it in the course of a
rush of work designed for the public good
call it by other and mostly unprintable
names. With one important exception, the
work of protecting Australia against dis-
ease is in the hands of the States. The
exception is the small group of diseases
which are dealt with by the Federal Quar-
antine Acts, and which comprise cholera,
plague, small-pox, typhus fever, and, to a
limited extent, leprosy. It is an important
exception, although all these diseases put
together have not slain in the whole history
of Australia nearly as many persons as con-
sumption and syphilis kill in a single year.
Prior to 1909 each State had its own
Quarantine Act, just as it now has its own
Health Act, and it ran its quarantine in
any old way it pleased, with any sort of
ramshackle staff and buildings. When an
outbreak of, say, small-pox, occurred in one
State, all the others proceeded to enforce
varying degrees of isolation against that
State as a whole. During the Tasmanian
outbreak of small-pox in 1903, for example,
N. S. Wales was admitting passengers from
Hobart, whilst Victoria was jambing them
into quarantine if they could not show re-
cent vaccination marks. As Victoria did
not trouble itself about train traffic at
Albury, this only necessitated a roundabout
trip for those who wanted to avoid vaccina-
tion, and did not protect Victoria. State
administration of quarantine was also apt
to be marked by a tendency to release dis-
tinguished but unvaccinated travellers of
the uppah-suckle variety, before they had
finished —or even begun—their spell in quar-
antine. To do the State Health Depart-
ments justice, this was not all their fault.
Public health has no definite political
value such as a pleased distinguished visitor
may have ; State public health officials hold
their jobs on very uncertain tenures; and
the average Minister of Health is not the
most brilliant of the bunch. He has plenty
of power to interfere if he wants to, and
about the best that can be expected from
him is that he will have sufficient sense to
refrain from exercising the power of inter-
ference in a technical job such as this. Since
1909 the Federal Quarantine Service has
run matters of sea quarantine on a uniform
and systematic basis, and it is getting to be
high time that some similar efficiency of
control and direction should be secured for
other varieties of poverty-making and death-
dealing disease.
The various State Health Acts are
mostly inadequate, and very uneven at best.
Those of Victoria and New South Wales
are hopelessly out of date. The administra-
tion is just as uneven, and from the prac-
tical working standpoint, also out of date.
Only one State has made any honest at-
tempt to deal with venereal diseases, and
even there the work has been hampered by
the political interference of legislative sen-
ility on the one hand and of wowserism on
the other. Consumption kills over 3000
Australians every year. Its practical con-
trol is mostly left to the municipalities. Now
and then the State Health Departments
deliver a fresh set of platitudes on the sub-
ject of street spitting or tuberculous milk ;
but, with the possible exception of Victoria,
they do little or nothing of any real value
in checking the direct spread- of infection.
Typhoid fever accounts for some 700 Aus-
tralians annually, besides disabling a vastly
greater number for many weeks at a time.
Both it and consumption are diseases
especially of the working periods of life, a
feature which increases enormously their
powers of mischief in a working country
such as ours. Despite the recent discovery
of a vaccine which protects for years against
typhoid, with little or no unpleasant result
at the time of inoculation, no organised
effort has been made by any State to place
it within the easy reach of those who live
or work in the numerous typhoid centres of
the back country. Even such a simple and
straightforward business detail as the uni-
form labelling of food products under the
Pure Food Acts has taken two conferences
of Federal and State officials, and miles of
correspondence, to settle. At this rate of
progress inter-State uniformity of effort
against, say, syphilis, may be expected about
the time that the Little Boy from Manly
grows white whiskers and rheumatics.
Without some approach at uniformity of
direction, operations against disease are
about as effective as military operations
against an organised invader would have
been in the good old days of State volun-
teers and softgoods political colonels. This
does not imply a dark Socialistic intention
to Federalise back yards and dead animals
and choked drains. Consumption, typhoid
and venereal diseases are national questions,
and State control is evidently a failure so
far as they are concerned. It is a failure
for the simnle reason that it brings in no
revenue, and is difficult to use for purposes
of keeping a party in office. In fact, public
health matters are so closely and adversely
related to the vested-interest question that
the average politician of the State brand
would sooner run a mile—and he is seldom
in good training for that sort of exercise—-
than get himself mixed up with them. The
United States have been faced with the same
problem of local inefficiency and apathy
in respect of diseases which are capable of
causing national disaster, or at best of
working untold harm in the way of poverty-
production. They have met it by the estab-
lishment of a United States Public Health
Service, controlled only by the National
Government; but this organisation can only
onerate in a State if it is invited to do so.
The Australian Constitution includes Quay-
antine as a specified field of Federal acti-
vity, and the definition of quarantine
is a very wide one indeed. Some day, when
the noise of scrapping for office has died
down sufficiently to allow a little horse-sense
to be heard, there will be a fine opportunity
for some Government to establish an Aus-
tralian Health Service, and to deal effec-
tively with some of the larger and more
important features of national lmalth-pro-
tection. The machinery is already there,
and the States are not likely to howl very
Ludly if they are asked to give up some of
the health duties which they do not perform
and certainly do not want.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Importing Workers While Exporting
Work.
When the very deliberate inter-State Coin-
mission lias finished —if it ever does finish
—inquiring into the “import” side of Pro-
tection, it will find gallons of work before it
in looking into the “export” side of the
matter. Fellmongering is one item of this
“export” business. In 1884 Geelong had
28 fellmongeries, employing over 500 per-
sons, paying goo_d wages and yielding satis-
factory profits. To-day most of the 28 are
closed, and those that still struggle on do so
with difficulty. About 1884, French, Ger-
man and Belgian skin-buyers cairie nosing
round and bought a few skins, and no one
took much notice; but in course of time
they perceived that they werd' on a good
wicket. By 1904 they took away from the
Commonwealth 4,338,962 sheepskins, besides
the hides of many bulkier animals. By
1909 they had increased their purchases of
sheepskins to 10,021,081; by 1910 to
11,323,959. They paid the market price for
them, of course, and so did not directly im-
poverish the Commonwealth; but the Aus-
tralian fellmonger —manufacturer as well as
employee—found himself up against trouble.
The foreigner took his skins home at no
greater cost for freight than the Geelong
man paid to send his fellmongered goods to
Melbourne or Sydney; and having taken the
raw goods to his own country, the foreigner
manufactured them there for about a third
as much as it cost the Geelong fellmonger,
and sent the manufactured goods back, or
sold them to his own people or their neigh-
bors. As the Geelong man was paying far
higher wages than the foreigner, and work-
ing his employees shorter hours, he simply
couldn’t outbid the foreigner for his raw
material, and he couldn’t get enough skins
at the ruling rates to fill his orders. So
he mostly shut up shop. To-day he is asking
for an export duty of Id. per lb. on raw
sheepskins, and his moderation is almost
amazing. To accede to his request would
hurt no living soul in the Commonwealth,
except the very occasional foreign skin-
bnyer. But it would do an immense amount
of good : it would ensure to Australia what
it is fully entitled to —the job of partly
manufacturing some of its own raw pro-
ducts. The foreigner must buy, and if he
is compelled to buy the finished leather in-
stead of the raw sheepskins, so much the
more work and the more wages and the more
population for the country whose interests
are the inter-State Commission’s first and
last and only consideration.

An Old-World Anomaly on Australian
Soil.
It was significant that the papers which
fought the Australian Defence movement to
the last ditch should have been the ones
to acc’aim most loudly Prime Minister
Cook’s decision to retain the kilt in the
Australian army. On a similar principle
Cook might agree, later, to the institution
of an Ulster regiment for militant anti-
liomanists ; or to a corps composed entirely
of members of the Sydney Pioneers’ Club;
or to any other tragic folly of the kind. By
encouraging Australian soldiers to garb them-
selves in kilts, sporrans, feathers and such-
like the Government is foisting on the
Commonwealth abuses that the mili-
tary authorities in the United Kingdom are
never done deploring. For every ounce of
good that these distinctions between regi-
ment and regiment do in Britain, the very
home of them, they accomplish about a ton
of harm. That is an axiom amongst
those experts who aim at homogeneity in
the service. The Rifle Brigade has the
privilege of being allowed to march at a
ouicker pace than any other regiment;
the Buffs may traverse London with their
arms held at a peculiar angle; the Welsh
Fusiliers are permitted to wear at the back
of their necks the cloths which were in
vogue in the tie-wig period—one might go
on indefinitely citing the queer, purposeless
privileges which have been granted to vari-
ous British regiments. One. effect is to
produce acute class distinctions between
the bodies of men concerned. In a country


where class distinctions prevail overwhelm-
ingly in every walk of life, and in no class
more than the military one, such things are
less disastrous than they are bound to be
if they get a footing in the Commonwealth.
It is the desire of every patriotic Australian
that the local army shall be completely
democratic, inasmuch as the moment it be-
comes otherwise it must inevitably fall into
public disfavor. At present the different
regiments are distinguished by their numbers
alone. The son of a millionaire squatter or
merchant is liable to find himself in the
ranks side by side with the son of a bottle-
gatherer or other humble citizen ; and their
officer may be the bottle-gatherer’s son’s elder
brother; which, under such a training system
as ours, is as it should be. Within a very
short time of the introduction of Scotch,
Irish or other bogus overseas regiments the
human-nature proposition will begin to assert
itself, and the snobs of the community will
rush the gaudier corps. They will do it not only
because of the latter’s shadowy association
with the United Kingdom, but because when
guards of honor and so forth are required,
the garish uniform of the imitation overseas
regiment will be bound to be preferred to. the
drab garments of the frankly local warriors.
A surer way of engendering ill-feeling in the
service could not well be devised. The idea,
in this country, is that a soldier should take
pride not in the fact that he is permitted to
wear green trousers, or none at all, but rather
in the circumstance that he wears the num-
ber of the smartest and most efficient regi-
ment in the land. There is no “loyalty in-
volved in hanging on to the kilt, as Sydney
Telegraph —which bracketed the 1 isher
Government’s banishment of that rather ab-
surd garment with its eradication of the
King’s head from the postage stamp—tried
hard to make out. It is as idiotic to associate
loyalty and kilts as it is to connect loyalty
and top hats. By reintroducing the ancient
Scottish covering the futile Cook Government
has done something that will not edify the
Heart of Empire worth 2d., but. will
certainly produce a lot of most undesirable
derision, annoyance, contempt, anger and the
like amongst the local forces.. In brief, it has
acted as a congenitally Anti-Defence Admin-
istration might have been expected to act.

The Law and a Blind Eye.
Tiie arrest at Omeo (Vic.) of a man
alleged to be John H. Sparks, who escaped
from Pentridge gaol in 1901, lets a large
problem loose. Sparks was sentenced in
1899 to 10 years’ hard labor, along with
one Negus, his mate, in a case of robbery
under arms; but, finding prison life weari-
some, he, with one O’Connor, scaled the
walls on a morning in July and faded away
into a heavy fog. O’Connor was recap-
tured a few weeks later in Sydney; but
Sparks was a bushman, and apparently got
right out of the cities. Now, it happened
that the constable largely instrumental in
Sparks’s arrest was transferred lately to
Omeo, and there he recognised him, or at
any rate thought he did. Of course the
Omeo man averred he knew nothing about
Sparks or his doings, and could give an ac-
count of himself and his goings and comings
for the last 10 years—and he turned out not
to be Sparks at all. But supposing he had been
that enterprising person, what then? The
lately-accused is a married man with four
young children; he has lived at Omeo for
about 10 years, and is well and favorably
known throughout the district. If he had
been Sparks, his brief taste of gaol had
obviously achieved its intent; he had become
an honest, useful citizen, with responsibili-
ties which he is fulfilling satisfactorily.
Why, then, if no mistake had been made,
send him back to gaol? He was doing
well; and would more gaol be at all
likely to make him do any better?
The difficulty is that our system hasn’t
yet made up its mind as to the pur-
pose of gaol. What is it —punishment or
reformation? If it is punishment, and if the
punishment was well fitted to the crime in
the first place, then plainly John H. Sparks
hasn’t had enough. But if it is reformation,
then it seems quite plain that he had had
just enough (that is if the two men had
been identical), and any more might have
spoiled the whole effect. But getting back to
punishment, what is that for? There is clearly
no sense in it except for two things—(l)
it may be a means of reforming the offender
or at any rate of keeping him from offending
again; (2) it may deter others from offend-
ing. As to its first purpose, the punish-
ment Sparks took seems to have had its
proper effect, for he has not fallen into the
hands of the police in 12 or 13 years, and
the further punishment which he escaped
might quite easily have made him a much
worse man; while, if punishment is to be
viewed as a deterrent, who is going to be
deterred from robbery-under-arms by the
arrest of a man who escaped from gaol 12
years ago and had been forgotten by every-
body but one or two officials? Admittedly,
apart from this case altogether, it is a
difficult problem. It won’t do either to
encourage prisoners to attempt escape, or
to foster the idea that when they have
escaped they will not be re-arrested even
if they have meantime behaved themselves.
But when men have escaped so long ago
that their exploit has been forgotten, and
when their present conduct is so exemplary
that they are plainly in no need of further
correction, the Law that lays hands on
them and drags them back to confinement
doesn’t seem to this paper to know the good
use that can sometimes be made of a blind
eye.

The Pot Reviles the Kettle Which is Not
Quite so Black.
In railing at the transitory Victorian Labor
Ministry which was rushed into a false posi-
tion by the intrigues of its Tory foes. Mel-
bourne’s one-eyed Tory journal practically
offered an excuse for the tactics it con-
demned. Said the Argus :
A Cabinet less desperately anxious to hang on to
office until the last possible moment would have
resigned forthwith. These political adventurers make
great professions of disinterestedness, but the truth
is too obvious to be disguised They would dearly
like to be left in office during the many weeks which,
at this season, must intervene before the electors
could bid them begone.
As a matter of fact, the anxiety of Labor-
Premier Elmslie to draw Ministerial salary
during the weeks when political business
would be suspended was no more glaring than
the eagerness of ex-Premier Watt to do the
same thing. Both parties were playing the
game of party politics for the sweets of
office. The tactics of a third party had sud-
denly put the Elmslie lot in by putting the
Watt lot out, and when that third party as
suddenly put Watt back it did so on condi-
tions which Watt subsequently rejected. But
that made no difference to Watt —he went
ahead just the same as if he had got the
Tory party’s support by including McLeod
and his friend. On the other hand, Elmslie
did at least make an attempt to hasten the
dissolution of a highly unsatisfactory Assem-
bly, which dissolution a vast majority of the
electors would welcome as a possible means
of putting one or other well-defined party
in absolute power. Under present conditions
no well-defined party can be in power. Elms-
lie can do nothing, and Watt is likely to be
forced to resign again as soon as he tries
to do anything. He has, in short, merely
deprived Elmslie of the privilege of getting
paid for doing nothing of political import
which is the privilege that the Cook Govern-
ment has also enjoyed in the Federal Parlia-
ment for the past eight months, and is the
same privilege that the Watt Government
is likewise going to enjoy for as long as it
can stave off the re-assembling of Parlia-
ment.
Now that the Referenda are safely out of
the way the truth may he told. This is
from the S. M. Herald of a week ago:—
Few people other than those actually engaged in
the trade have any idea how wholesale prices for
dairy produce are fixed. Perhaps it is just as well
that this is so.
At the beginning of the year the produce selling
agents of Sussex-street decided that the grocer should
pay the cost of the butter box, and also incidentally
that he should pay cartage on all dairy produce. An
agreement was accordingly drawn up which set form
that from a certain date butter boxes would be
charged for at the rate of lOd. each or Is. Bd. per
cwt. if the produce' was taken delivery of in bussex-
street, but that if it had to be forwarded to the
suburbs cartage at the rate of 4d. per cwt., or 2d.
per box, would be charged. ,
In due course the boxes were debited to the grocer,
who in turn passed the extra cost on to the con-
sumer, with, it is said, a little extra added for
himself. Taking the Sydney consumption at about
8000 boxes per week, this extra charge works out
at something like £20,000 per annum.... The price
of butter in Sydney is fixed by the general manager
of one of the big houses, acting in conjunction with
two other gentlemen....
They are monopolists,' and monopolists are aan-
Although the butter trade is by far the largest and
most important in the dairying industry, the position
of other lines at times tends towards the conditions
obtaining in the butter world.
It just shows how these Rings and Combines
grow. As we all know, there were none
when the Referenda were taken a few
months ago.

Fitzpatrick, Chairman of the Victorian
Railway Commissioners, has lately been to
Europe and America, collecting evidence of
the wrong things that are done and the
right things that are left undone by the
railways of this easy-going country. But
no rapid reform of obsolete railway methods
is exnected of Fitzpatrick. He is not
built that way. Moreover, the majority of
the State’s customers don’t know how badly
they are treated in some respects, and are
therefore meek and uncomplaining. They do
not know, for instance, how much trouble
in regard to personal luggage could be
spared them if the Department were not in
league with Private Enterprise. Bad old
Private Enterprise in Victoria has a mono-
poly of all the luggage-carrying business
which in Britain is conducted by the rail-
ways themselves. Trunk, bag and parcel
handling that ought to be well and cheaply
done by the Department for the conveni-
ence of travelling citizens and the good of
the State is badly and expensively done by
private-enterprise firms whose names are
household curses in every suburban home.
The extortionate carrier, never calling for
the dress-baskets when he is most wanted,
is a horrible consideration whenever holiday
trips are talked about. Not only does the
Railway management permit Private En-
terprise to undertake the conveyance of
luggage; it even penalises anybodv who
sends a nortmanteau hv train instead of hv
earrier from one metropolitan suburb to
another. A man travelling from, say, Mel-
bourne to South Yarra can take a con ole
of bags with him in the carriage. The
Railway Department carries him and his
luggage for 3d. But if he wants to send the
same luggage to South Yarra station to be
called for. the charge is not less than a
shilling. What excuse could Chief Railway
Commissioner Fitzpatrick offer for this
policy?
“Winika’S” view of the earlier closing of
pubs:—
One E. L. Slade Mallen lately announced him-
self to the public through the Herald as “a keen
student of the liquor problem,” and then proceeded
to eat up more or less valuable space with a refuta-
tion of the flattering statement. In urging the
earlier closing of hotels in Australia, E. L. Slade,
etc., pointed to the 10 o’clock closing of the bars in
Maoriland as an example to be followed in the
Commonwealth in order to reduce dr in Jcinff. Any
one conversant with the operation of the scheme in
the Shickery Isles knows that, instead of the 10
o’clock rule lessening the consumption of liquor,
it has increased it. I know. I was there when it
was commenced; I have studied it on the spot for
years, with special opportunities for doing so. In
Wellington, for instance, when the No-license crowd,
with the powerful vote of the moderate drinker
(known then and since as the “protest” vote —pro-
test against Bung’s greed and other things), swamped
the Licensing Committee with its nominees (who
were pledged to 10 p.m. closing), great was the
lamentation of the Man Behind the Pump. But he
wailed out of his turn. The whole thing worked
something like the daylight-saving device. Instead
of the pubs’ customers commencing to beat round
town at about the usual hour of 8 p.m., they got a
move on at 7 or 7.30, and, reckoning that 10 p.m.
would be round “before a Bloke could get a few in,”
they hustled their drinking. Result: More business.
You can nearly always tell a visiting Maorilander
in Sydney or Melbourne by the increased pace of
his drinking (provided he is drinking) about 9 p.m.
He’s beating the clock! Mallen is at liberty to
doubt my word that the consumption of liquor has
increased in M.L. since 10 a m. became the fashion
in bar-closing, but if he doubts the word of the
official compilers of the drink bill I’ll know exactly
what to think of him. Here’s another phase of the
scheme. Men, particularly young men, get far more
liquor in the clubs and in private after 10 o’clock
than they would if the public bars were open till 11.
No; don’t all yell at once —I know that the clubs
iu M.L. come under the Licensing Act, and that,
therefore, their bars close at the same hour as the
hotel bars. (Even Parliament House refreshment
bar is no exception.) But it is here that the per-
nicious evil of keeping your own bottle starts to get
in its fine work. I’ve stood up many times to half
a dozen young bloods, each with his particular bottle
nice and handy (and it was almost always spirits)
in the main cities and lesser towns, and
the simpletons who theorise about reducing
the retail selling hours can take it from a
somewhat case-hardened citizen that it re-
quired some strength of character and more dip-
lomacy to keep sober on those occasions. I’m
convinced that the more restrictions you place upon
the liquor business the more will drinkers take their
supplies beyond the reach of harassing laws and
uncomfortable conditions. That’s where the anti-
public bar flock make the mistake. If they were to
barrack for ideal State refreshment places—-gardens
with promenades, bars, restaurants and music, open
to all, where there would be no feeling of sneaking
in and no repugnance to taking women and children
—they might get somewhere near that point which
they’ll never reach the other way. Meanwhile, re-
duction of liquor-selling places in a few suburbs,
or the reduction of hours of trading, or such-like
tinkering with a question that can be finally solved
only by education, is futility on its last legs.
The wickedness of being found out lias
lately been discoursed upon by Archbishop
Clarke at Melbourne Anglican Cathedral.
His remarks were incidental to the question
whether the Church ought to consent to
marry divorced persons :
No person who had passed through the Divorce
Court would receive the Church’s blessing on a second
marriage except that person were wholly innocent.
He wished to speak of his own personal experience
in this matter. In some cases he had consented to
the remarriage of divorced persons, but he had
learned the sad lesson that Divorce Court evidence
was never to be trusted. In the future he would
have to exercise greater care, and he felt he would
rarely be able to sanction the marriage of persons
who had passed through the Divorce Court.
The Church, on Archbishop Clarke’s own
showing, is always prepared to bestow its
blessings and sacraments on any social sin-
ner who hasn’t been found out. The crime
before Heaven is in the exposure. The widows
and widowers who might have passed through
the Court had they been less careful are in
a position to undertake further matrimony
under blessing of the Church. Also, the
spinsters and bachelors who studied for the
co-re. degree, but did not get it. Any of
these can be joined together in a first or
second marriage. The Church, indeed, in-
vites them cordially to come along and be
blessed. But if they had not contrived to
avoid being found out, the Church would de-
clare them disqualified from getting married
at all. Thus sin is not really a thing that
the Devil tempts people to; it is something
that the neighbors and a private detective
bring to light. And when it is brought to
light and the sinners ask permission from
Archbishop Clarke to get married and sin
no more —well, the scandalised prelate up-
lifts his fat white hands and exclaims,
“Heaven forbid !”

Those interested persons who allege that
bookmakers’ odds compare favorably with
totalisator dividends, and the anti-
gambling parsons who echo that awful
untruth, can put the following statis-
tics in their pipes and smoke ’em.
It isn’t often that an actual compari-
son can be made; but Ikey Mo competed
against the Tote at the recent W.A.T.C.
meeting, and here are the first day’s results:

A ten-shilling investment on every winner
at the published starting price offered by the
bookmakers would have produced £2l profit,
whereas a 10s. Tote ticket on every winner
would have returned £37 Gs. profit. And
this is assuming that Ikey Mo did offer 14

though it is much more likely that 10 to 1
was the limit in both cases to 10s. punters.
From “J.D.5.,” an English leather expert,
at present in Australia :
When Australia does not produce the best it is
important to know why. Now, the best Australian
leather is not, and never has been, equal to the
best English leather. The proof is that a higher
price is paid for the latter by the large boot manu-
facturers and the large users of driving belts, who do
not pay for sentiment.
There are only three possible reasons: (1) The
quality of the raw hides; (2) the preparation or
tanning of the hides, and (3) the question of drying.
Let us look at them in a row. (1) It cannot be
this, because some of the very best leather imported
from England is made from Australian hides. (2)
I do not believe it is this either, because in every
tanner’s yard of importance in this country, either
the proprietor or the manager, or both, were trained
in England, and know all that is known of the
chemistry and practice of tanning. (3) There re-
mains, then, only the question of drying; and it is
here that the cause of failure will be found.
It is not infrequent to find in Australia the tem-
perature by the dry-bulb thermometer anywhere
between 85° and 100°, while the wet-bulb ranges
between 60° and 75°. These great differences in the
wet- and dry-bulb readings mean that the air is very
dry, containing only (say) 27 per cent, to 30 per
cent, of moisture. Now, in England, the percentage
of moisture rarely falls below 65, and for months
together is in the neighborhood of 90. This greater-
moisture gives better drying; hence the tanning has
a chance to do its work, the color is more
even, and the leather is stronger and more pliable.
In Australia the great dryness of the atmosphere
brings out the tanning to the surface too quickly,
discolors the leather, particularly at the edges, and
renders it brittle and for many purposes almost
useless.
When I was a lad the old tanner at home used
to say that “leather should not be dried at a
higher temperature than 70°.” He was neither scien-
tific nor observant, which is much the same thing,
or he would not have blamed the temperature. Most
of his leather was spoilt or discolored when the
cold dry east winds of March were blowing, proving
conclusively that the dryness of the air caused the
trouble.
The modern tanner in England has thus an advan-
tage over the Australian in the greater natural
moisture in the air. But to-day he is not satisfied
with this advantage, mainly because it is slow and
uncertain; hence he resorts to scientific drying. He
dries all kinds of leather in a temperature round
about 100° ; but he puts no trust in the old weather-
boards and the “varying winds of Heaven.” He
scientifically controls the quantity of air he requires,
its temperature and its humidity, and these are the
reasons for the superiority of his leather.
Tf the tanners in this country mean to get ahead,
and do the work I think they ought to do, they must
go and do likewise. Indeed, the natural weather
conditions being less favorable than those of Eng-
land, there is far more reason why they should pro-
duce’ the requisite artificial conditions. I need
hardly add that the requisite artificial conditions are
as easily produced here in Australia as anywhere
else.
From a coastal skipper :
Among the various things shrieking to be made
uniform —from the railway gauge downwards —is one
whose standardising would cost practically nothing.
That is the tide and dredge signals. We have the
system of buoyage that all civilised countries have
adopted ; but in the matter of tide and dredge sig-
nals each little State has its own code, and some-
times more than one. The inter-State skipper has to
keep in his head half a dozen different sets of signals,
with the chance of getting them mixed at a most
inopportune moment. For instance, a Queensland
dredge shows a red flag on the side you’ve to pass
it. South Aus. has a complicated system by which
a red flag means pass on one side and a blue flag
pass on the other going into port. Of course, it’s
all turned round coming out. The Victorian sticks
up a thing like a Soccer football. There’s the same
diversity in the lights they show at night. As for
tide signals, a red light means flood tide in one State
and ebb tide in another, while a third prefers
green lights. To indicate the depths of water, each
Marine Board —Marine Department, Navigation De-
partment, or whatever the local authority happens
to call itself—follows its own inclination. It would
be a simple matter to have one system for all Aus-
tralia, to the saving of confusion ; and confusion
means danger. The inter-Stater who pokes in and
out anywhere from Cairns round to Geraldton has
enough to do remembering the 20 or so ports he s
“exempt” for, without piling on to him unnecessary
differences in this matter of signals; and, some day,
when he forgets one or two of the unnecessary things
he ought to remember, a few people will be drowned.
Thus “Sparker” :
I want to hail “Shipmate” (B. 25/12/T3) and
ask him how much faith he reposes in the wireless
apparatus for which he clamors. A little general
knowledge of the subject would quickly dispel the
illusion from which the public suffers that the
spark is sure to bring assistance when the time comes
to get the women and children into the boats.
Although the 700 survivors of the Titanic undoubt-
edly owe their lives to wireless, the 1600 non-survi-
vors owe their fate to the mismanagement of the
wireless organisation. The nearest ship to the scene,
although fitted with Marconi’s apparatus, was only
fitted with one operator, who was asleep at the
time —even wireless operators cannot keep awake
day and night for 255. a week —and while he slept
the sleep of the underpaid, the Titanic passengers
perished. This happened in the North Atlantic,
where wireless-fitted ships are thicker than State
Governors in Australia. Apply the lesson to our
own coasts, where a ship may be for days out of
touch with anyone; add to this the fact that the
operator on the ship just the other side of the
horizon is asleep, and you have all the ingredients
for a first-class newspaper scoop when the übiquitous
uncharted rock pokes its nose through the ship s
bottom. Ships’ operators keep watch at stated hours,
but the peculiarity of ocean disasters is that they
decline to confine their operations within stated
hours. Personally, I have spent as much as two
days screaming to the heavens in an endeavor to get
into communication with a ship within easy range,
and, when you come to think of it, quite a lot or
people can drown in two days. The remedy is
obvious: Continuous watch, day and night. Of course,
Private Fmterprise, which controls the matter, w|ll
see no beautv in the idea; but there is no reason
why all ship stations should not be acquired by the
Government, and run as postal telegraph offices in the
same manner as the shore stations are. Until the
Government takes them over, or L compels Private
Enterprise to keep continuous watch, the b.O.b. call
will be shrieked forth into an unheeding atmosphere,
and passengers will be left to drown Meanwhile,
the gullible traveller, fascinated by the company s
announcement, “All steamers fitted with wireless
telegraphy,” journeys on, confidently imagining that
the operator has but to press his key and assistance
will materialise.
Somebody in authority should rise to
officially contradict the person who
writes on tropical agriculture in Mel-
■ bourne Age ; otherwise an indignant
tropical agriculturist, who follows the Ag®
and fails, will probably return to Collins-
street to dynamite the office that sent him
to his undoing. The Age recommends copra
production, as practised in Timor, as an
ideal Northern Territory industry—which it
might be, on a few islands off the coast and
in the jungle fringe of the mainland itself.
But the figures put forward are stark
lunacy. Forty acres of young palms will, it
is alleged, net the holder £IOOO a year. That
is, “six palms to the acre, and a net return
of £4 to £5 per palm ; or on well-established
plantations, from £7 to £8 per tree per an-
num.” Wonderful! But, unhappily, only a
wonderful invention. Anybody who knows
anything about copra-growing in (say) the
Solomons will know that the plantation with
six trees to the acre is as rare as the palm
that nets £7 a year. Put it at 7s. and you
are nearer the mark, though still over it in
very many cases. The Age expert, however,
goes further and blares worse: —
No energetic man need fear taking up copra grow-
ing, thinking the labor too hard for the climate.
After the planting there is practically no manual
labor required. The planter must go round the
trees each morning and evening when the nuts are
falling, play a game of bowls with them under the
shade of the palms, rolling them into heaps, and his
work is done.
Nothing about the tropical undergrowth
which makes continuous cultivation a neces-
sity if you are to keep the plantation from
reverting to jungle. All you do is to play
bowls with the cocoanuts and be boob
enough to wait for “a net return of' £7 to £8
a tree.” Before that happens another cocoa-
nut falls on your own ; and you wake up.

A much-travelled man speaks up for Aus-
tralia’s State-owned railways:—
It is the fashion of daily newspapers and people
who vote for Cuttlefish Joseph Cook to intermit-
tently throw mud at any State-owned public utility
because it is State-owned. The railways are always
fair game to these people; hence the Argus loudly
objects to the statement by Fitzpatrick, Chairman
of Victorian Railway Commissioners, that “he had
seen in his travels no better steam suburban railway
system than that of Melbourne.” But, as usual, the
Argus didn’t produce any evidence in support of
itself. The big mistakes and of Australian
railways—for a terrible example, that \of Sunshine —
have been mostly caused bv know-all railway experts
from afar, their heads swollen by the adulation given
to anything foreign by these slavish dailies, attempt-
ing to graft on to the Australian system peculiar
conditions which became ridiculous outside of the
country of their origin. I have travelled a few
miles on railroads, and I say that there is no road
in Australia with the insanitary coaches I paid first-
class fares for or, the London, Chatham and Dover ;
no main lines in Australia as bad as the best lines
in Italy; and no attempt has ever been made in
Australia to come nigh the general beastliness and
inefficiency of the London and South-Eastern. The
American railways are held up as the last word in
transport; but their high-speed trains are so costly
that the average Australian would faint at the
price. The American lines, moreover, hold the
record for killing people; and because the Pullman
concern has a pull over most of the big lines, the
old. uncomfortable longitudinal sleepers are exclu-
sively used, and the passenger is charged_ £6 for six-
nig'hts Sleeper New York to ’Frisco or New York to
Vancouver for a highly intimate car wherein a lady
mav be an upper to a blushful man’s lower, or the
modest bachelor may sleeo on the second storey over
a married couple in the lower berth. I am charged
in Australia half the American fee for a place in a
2-berth cabin from Melbourne to Adelaide —one of
the finest runs in the world; and a similar sum gives
me a berth in a two-berth cabin on the Melhourne-
Sydnev express in a car which has been evolved from
Australian conditions, and yet challenges the world

as a ear-de-luxe. Kalgoorlie was only a pup born in
the wilderness when the W.A. Government started
running sleepers and diners from Perth, and making
*l lr ! e or a H the narrow gauge. Flinders-street
(Melb.) is one of the busiest terminals of suburban
traffic in the world, and it is well-handled even in
its rush traffic, which is the great test. The mileage
of Queensland railways is in proportion to popula-
tion five times greater than that of any other
country. Taking it all in all—continental distances,
sparse population and the railway age of the States
the Australian services make a good showing, even
after the discount of political mistakes. It’s a good
thing for the Australian to be hard-headed enough
to see the necessity for the improvement of himself
and his country; but I weary of these dreary old
prejudices of the Englisher who, once safe from con-
tradiction among stay-at-home Australians, lies boldly
because he comes from afar.
In relation to large questions nothing better
showed the slackness of the Watt Govern-
ment than its burlesque policy with regard
to the “red plague”—syphilis, etc. Instead
of making this a notifiable and quarantin-
able disease and providing adequate accom-
modation at public hospitals, it first granted
a few thousands to a few institutions, then
reduced the vote to as many hundreds, and
left things at that. The consequence was
that the Alfred Hospital closed its ward;
and now the Women’s Hospital has followed
suit. As Dr. Cuscaden told his fellow-com-
mittee-men and women, the Government
"was merely playing with the question.
When small-pox appeared people became
scared and rushed the public vaccinators.
J>ut syphilitic infection was infinitely more
dangerous; the disease extended from gene-
ration to generation, with most terrible
results. The Government was but paltering
with the matter, and as the hospital staff
expenses, for the six beds the Government
was walling to provide would be the same as
for the 25 beds they needed, they would
have to close the ward.” And they'did so.
Deak Bulletin. —While Sydney’s two gas
cos. are diligently seeking a means to again
raise the price of their commodity to the
long-suffering consumer, I desire your co-
operation to place before Premier Holman a
few pertinent and sensible remarks made by
a prominent politician in the Centenary
Hall. Speaking as the accredited repre-
sentative of the Labor party, he declared :—-
In Manchester some years ago they had a gas co.
giving them the blessings of Private Enterprise and
of competition. What this co. made I cannot tell
you ; we can possibly imagine it. But what I can
tell you is this, that some 20 or 25 years ago the
municipality of Manchester took that" over. They
borrowed £2,000,000 to do it They immedi-
ately raised the wages of the employees, they
immediately lowered the price of gas to the con-
sumer, they immediately shortened the hours of the
employees, they immediately commenced paying a
sinking fund, the result of which is that they have
now practically paid off one-half of that £2,000,000.
In addition to that, they have made during the 20
years they have held it two and a half million pounds
of absolute profit which has gone in Manchester to
the reduction of the rates. I sat' where one mono-
poly has been brought under collective control in
that way one hundred others can be with equal
readiness. That is all we propose.
Of course, the politician who so pledged him-
self and his party had then no power to
carry out the pledge ; but now that the party
has full and uncAiallengeable power in the
requisite Assembly, I would be glad to
learn what Mr. Holman proposes to do. —-
Yours truly, Billy B. P.S. —The politician
who made the above declaration was W. A.
Holman, during a debate with George Reid
on “Socialism as defined in the Australian
labor Party’s Objective and Platform,”

T. R. Johnson ends his connection with the
N.S.W. railways at the middle of this month,
when he goes on 10 weeks’ leave, and that
will see his term out. John Harper, the
Assistant Commissioner, who will carry on
the work as Acting-Chief Commissioner, is
a traffic man. whereas Johnson is an engin-
eer; and as they are really traffic problems
which have been worrying the N.S.W. rail-
ways most, the change from the imported
man who had everything to learn about local
conditions to the local man who knows
local conditions from A to Z, should be dis-
tinctly for the better. The new Acting-
Chief Commissioner is a Parramatta native
who has passed through every grade of the
service from porter upwards.
A Continental Sugar Trust is aiming at
the trade of Britain. It is a combination
of 14 big refiners : seven Austrian, five Ger-
man, one Dutch and one Belgium. As a
bait it offers a bonus of lid. a cwt. to those
who will undertake not to buy any sugar
from outsiders. But the British wholesaler
has met the Trust octopus before,
wherefore the members of the Wholei
sale Sugar Dealers’ Association have taken
a pledge not to place themselves in the
power of this one by having anv
dealings with it. How long that good
resolution _ will answer is another matter.
The bait is bound to attract some get-rich-
quick shopkeepers sooner or later, and their
competition will cause trouble. If public
opinion says a thing is bad there is onlv one
way to make that decision effective—by
translating it into law. Then, for the man
who breaks through the good resolution,
there is punishment. But where the good
resolution has not been translated into law
there is in most cases extra profit for the
man who first breaks away from it.

“Gome Over Here” has been pruned of
many of its original superfluities and fool-
ishnesses, and is doing profitable business
in the amended form at Her Majesty’s,
Sydney.
At the Adelphi (Sydney) the panto
“Aladdin” is running smoothly, except that
it has been minus the vivacity of Carrie
Moore through indisposition. The dashing
leg-time revue which closes the first act
continues to be the most discussed feature
of the show. Judgment: Men, “Don’t take
me home” ; women, “Hussies !”
The only objection this writer has to that
amusing, trifle, “Officer 666,” at the Criterion,
is that in this weather it is too much like
hard work to have to laugh so frequently.
The proper play for a Sydney theatre on a
sweltering night is “East Lynne.” The
gentle sound of falling tears is as refreshing
as the trickle of a fountain, and the woe
that falls like a gentle dew from the gallery
appreciably cools the air.
Julius Knight having stopped talking and
retreated from Sydney Royal with the script

Saturday next. There will be three nights
and a matinee of “Miss Elizabeth’s Pris-
oner,” followed by three nights of “A Mar-
riage of Convenience.” Then, on Saturday
(17th), comes “Monsieur Beaucaire.” of the

co. have made themselves curiously popular
to audiences, considering the abilities of

has kept the theatre filled since the opening

Amphitheatre, and, so that the stranger need
dlfficult y in locating the music-hall,
iHE BHLLETm hastens to state that it is
situated in Castlereagh-street (Sydney) be-

venient to nine pubs. So that while the
best in vaudeville may be found inside, the
best in spirituous and fermented liquor can
be handily obtained outside before the show
commences, during the interval, between
turns, while turns are in progress, and after
the show. Anybody who requires more
luxury should join the Millionaires’ Club.
So far the business at Sydnev’s recently-
constructed pleasure park, the White City
has justified those who opined that there'
w — fortune in the venture. The difficulty
ot traffic has been overcome to a very con-
siderable extent by a ferry-boat service from
-North Shore to Fort Macquarie, thence
to Kushcutter’s Bay. The thrill of the week
nas been Marie Thelin, who makes.a comet
ot herself by firing her paper frock and
diving from a height into a pool of water.

“The Forty Thieves” panto at Her

cise. Regan and Ryan, described as Lieu-
tenants of the Forty, who mummed in
unison and were doubly dismal, have de-
parted from the Christmas extravaganza’s
midst, and left no trace behind. They were
an imported pair, and as far as they mat-
tered in the least degree Rupert Darrell,
the local man, is replacing them. Lupino
and Brett have introduced new business to
the panto of late ; also signs of elaboration
are perceptible in the fine spectacular scene
of the cave, where the ballets dance before
Cassini Baba Atholwood what time he is
trying to remember the missing word. Marie
Eaton, as a clean-cut, gentlemanly Abdallah,
continues to yearn for the simple life in
Loveland, and to sing of Australia’s Navy
in swanky naval garments. But although
Marie performs her vocal duties very nicely,
it is not for its songs that the present panto
will be talked about. This is an off-season
for panto ditties. There is no bite in any
of them. They are either insipid variations
of the. stereotyped, or recognisable imitations
of noises that boomed before. Reminders
of “Waiting at the Church,” “Rings on her
Fingers,” “Ip-iady-iay” and other once-
popular song refrains assail the jaded ear.
This odor of. tune from the ocean of memory
is not a bit fragrant. It suggests that
musical decomposition has set in. One wishes
that the dead panto past had buried its dead.
As Beaucaire, the superlative Frenchman
who brings all the British mankind and

the swordsman whose brilliant skill is only

distinction concealed up his sleeve —as this
stupendous hero of stage romance Lewis
Waller will get a good send-off from Mel-
bourne Royal to-night (Thursday). On
Saturday the co. whereof Julius Knight is
guiding star will appear in “Diplomacy” at
the Royal. The English versionof Sardou’s
old play has been re-written up-to-date.

“The Land of Nod,” at the King’s, is the
same series of items strung on the same
thread of story. Things that happened in
the. first act a while ago are now trying
their luck in the second, and vice versa,' but
the poor little narrative remains just as
coherent (or otherwise) as it was in the
beginning. The Sleepy Pvjama Girl sings
to the accompaniment of sundry white legs
protruding through a black screen, and the
Pyjama Man is pushed into a tank by the
Principal Boy. If the present commen-
tator were running this entertainment

Uncle Tom is about to fold up his cabin

Two new arrivals at the Opera House are
Selma Braatz and Barton and Ashley.
Selma is a quite young lady who higgles
neatly enough, and wears a jaunty air of
self-satisfaction when she has accomplished
with moderate adroitness a feat which many
male disciples of Cinquevalli can perform
more easily. The time that Selma spends in
balancing a belltopper or a billiard cue on
her fair young brow seemed a rather long
time on Saturday last. Barton and Ashley
give a farcical sketch, one being a wild, fali-
about husband who has returned from the

wonders where the money came from. The
absurdity has gleams of humor in it, especi-
ally when the bloated capitalist chucks a
bundle of ill-gotten gains at the canary’s
cage and the bird begins to sing. The
Schmettans and other athletes wiil go on
athleting until further notice, but the clever
skaters glide out of the bill after to-night

interest in the lady skater —Nellie Donegan.
She was a local inhabitant when she started
her stage career as a kiddie dancer.
West has been devoting portion of his Mel-
bourne programme to a version of Ouida’s
“Moths.” The sex sentiment of “Moths”
seems dull and middle-aged to a population
that now takes it Elinor Glyn neat and its
Hubert Wales unabridged, but, all the same,
the yarn was enthusiastically received. Also,
the crowd was much obliged for the drama
“When the Clock Stopped,” and the views
of the State of Montana, where the rustler
used to swank with whole arsenals in his
belt.

Taken altogether, the entertainment of the
present team of Dandies at St. Kilda (Vic.)
is the best that Branscombe has yet proffered
in that shrieky suburb. There is not a
“passenger” in the whole outfit, the least
distinguished being a tenor warbler of senti-
mental moonshine. A light comedian who
tangos with the piquant soubrette and
dancer, Irene Vere, is acceptable whenever
he appears; and the other two ladies make
plenty of friends with their cool comeliness
and pleasing voices. Also, there is the
attenuated jester, Claude Dampier, who,
even if some of his jokes suggest ardent
research, has a naturally humorous manner
i:i presenting his discoveries.

Mclntosh has been in Adelaide, looking
into the question why the palatial and com-
fortable new Tivoli couldn’t attract
the crowds to Grote-street that the
little old house drew in King Wil-
liam-street ; but meantime Gene Greene
has put the problem to sleep by at-
tracting them. Lily Eyton and Lucille
Savoy are charming items- in the bill, and
Manuel de Fra gives the show a good adver-
tisement by falling off his pile of chairs and
tables on the outside parapets of lofty build-
ings in full public view. The King’s has a
clever crowd, mostly American, including the
dancing Leslies, some quaint marionettes
(Mantell’s), the “daredevil” Staigs. and the
really delightful Peg and “the Limit.” At the
Royal, Eugenie Duggan gets a chance in
“Life’s Shop Window.” Most of the offen-
siveness of the novel has been dropped out of
the play, but the heroine’s changes of part-
ners make a powerful story that is well acted
all round; and the stage setting is charming.

Mirths’ Circus is giving great jov, and get-
ting great profit, at the Old Exhibition,
while at the New the Dandies just keep on
attracting. West’s are starring a Vampire
drama, with appropriate dance, while Won-
dergraph relies on that safe stand-by, a con-
test of locally-chosen Beauties.
The yarn that the Northern Territory is
no good for white settlement recalls the
fact that, on the 31st of this month 110
years ago, Port Phillip, whereon Melbourne
is built, was abandoned by Collins as quite
uninhabitable.
An indignant Melbourne weekly points
out that Best entered State politics as a
sound democrat and throve as a democrat,
but is now a conspicuous bottle-holder for
Fat. “How shall the people punish this
renegade?” asks the agonised editor. The
Bulletin merely observes that no doubt in
Best’s opinion “What’s Best-administered is
best.”
Captain Barclay, who has been exploring
in the Northern Territory for the past two
years on account of the Commonwealth Gov-
ernment, has done good work. “Queensland
is the best of all States,” says he, “and the
Territory is better than Queensland.” But
having put that opinion on record, Captain
Barclay begins to maunder. “That [superi-
ority over Queensland] is,” he concludes,
“why some time ago I recommended that we
should go one better and call it Kingsland.”
Why pursue such shadows? The Territory
doesn’t want a name but a habitation —lots
of habitations —and railways and new har-
bors and more sheep and cattle and men.
Not a drachm of energy should be wasted on
a name, and the man who proposes to side-
track real work even for a moment should be
muzzled.
“Cross Jack”: The holiday season just
missed producing the ferry horror which
Sydney’s crowded harbor is marked up for.
The first escape was in the Cove at Cir-
cular Quay, when, after a bunny hug with
a Manly boat, the old wooden steamer Kan-
garoo became jambed between the big iron
ferry and a mail-boat. Luckily the Manly
boat skipper crawled off in time to spare
the Kangaroo from the eggshell act. The
other reprieve was when the Kosciusko,
laden with picnickers from Middle Harbor,
was caught on a swell and bumped down
on the rocks off Middle Head, where the
punch of the wide Pacific lands like the
steam hammer of Sheol. The succeeding
surge, instead of grinding the steamer on the
rocks, carried her clear, and she floundered
into deep water minus some of her keel.
This incident did not receive much public
notice, but it can hold its own in the front
rank of those narrow squeaks which are
becoming less and less uncommon.
Melbourne City Court bench is now un-
adorned by O’Callaghan, ex-Chief Commis-
sioner of Police. O’Callaghan’s disqualifi-
cations as an honorary magistrate are ob-
vious. His 40 or 50 years’ experience in
the department has naturally biassed
him in favor of the police, whilst familiaris-
ing him with numberless citizens who have
been prosecuted successfully or otherwise in
the past. The paid “beak” may remember
an accused person as one who was proved
innocent on a previous occasion to his (the
“beak’s”) complete satisfaction, whereas
O’Callaghan is more likely to remember him
as a person whom the police had declared
to be guilty, but who “slipped out” of their
clutches. No accused person’s innocence is
ever proved to the satisfaction of the
police. The bench is, in fact, no
place for any ex-detective. Suppose, for
instance, the case of a one-time burg-
lar who formerly had professional deal-
ings with detective O’Calliaghan: he
would be justly entitled to object to having
his former confidant among his judges; yet
if he made a formal protest in court he
would be casting suspicion on himself before
his trial commenced.
Those ingenuous persons who annually
drop several thousand unaddressed enve-
lopes into Commonwealth letter-boxes, and
then blame the P.O. officials for not deliver-
ing them, suffer from a similar aberration
in regard to articles sent by rail, especially
about Christmas time. There were unidenti-
fiable prams, umbrellas,' sporting utensils
and camping outfits at the Melbourne central
parcels office; but the worst trouble was the
dead or semi-dead stock. Poultry (plucked
and otherwise), fish and rabbits arrived
without labels and were thrown into a cor-
ner till the rush abated and someone had
time to look over them; but the rush con-
tinued for days—and rabbits don’t keep
well this weather. Away in a camp on
some creek somebody was blessing lazy city
dwellers for not acknowledging the receipt
of a seasonable gift; and some city dweller
was anathematising forgetful campers for
failing to send along the promised Christmas
tucker; while in the muggy, odoriferous
parcels offices perspiring railway servants
were consigning to perdition every lunatic
who hadn’t brains enough to see that a
deceased hen wore the name and address of
someone at whom they could throw it.
AT POVERTY POINT.
“Spasm ode”: “Come Over-Here,” say the baldies
to the bally,’ and the ballet, like Barkis, is willin’.
So we have the gangway. There is no originality in
it. Manager Elliston introduced it at Drury Lane
when he hired the props, used in George IV. ’s corona-
tion and acted the monarch. Hiccuping “Bless you
my people!” he fancied himself the real one. (Lam-
bert, by the way, acted the King of Bavaria with
Lola Montes in Sydney, and Lola said he was better
than the real king.) With the play of ‘‘Tom and
Jerry in London, they had a donkey race round the
back of the pit. A familiar circus act is that of
the drunken , swaggie who wants: to ride, and turns
out to be a star of the co. So much for the newest
‘ features” of revue and pantomime.
“M.L.”: “First Nighter’s” prescription (B. 1/1/’l4)
for popularising the revue in Australia won’t do any
good, for the revue is dead. It never really lived.
Alcohol and casualness make the revue in America!
The booze on the roof-gardens is the sauce piquante.
Scotch highballs at little tables in the auditorium;
in some places your dinner, if you please; Lilian
Lorraine riding up the plank on a white donkey to
the stage; Lilian Lorraine showing her thousand-
dollar stockings on a swing projected over the audi-
ence ; six Kentucky colonels refusing to pay for
their drinks in the stalls, and immediately thereafter
bursting into song about bluegrass and corn whisky •
Roosevelt entering from the orchestra and shooting
property lions—all these things are slow and boring
unless there be Scotch highballs, Manhattans and
old rye with a chaser. And the Australian is too
hardheaded, for the foolishness of the revue nonsense;
he likes his nonsense with some cleverness in it
which makes one wonder how he tolerated “Our Miss
Gibbs,” “Sunshine Girl” (and scores of other Girls),
“Autumn Manoeuvres,” “Luxembourg,” “Blue Moon,”’
“Cingalee,” etc. Certainly he didn’t tolerate them
sufficiently to make revivals payable, and when he
gets Gilbert and. Sullivan again he will just eat it.
Still, “First Nighter” has the right idea of a revue!
The delicate idealism and wholesome humor of a
satyr and a white slave, with the impossible hypo-
dermic syringe and the marvellous perfumed bouquet,
are just the thing—for England and other places
where wholesome views of sex matters are, among the
Best People, “quite bourgeois, you know.”
“0.K.”: John Coates, the burly dramatic tenor
who was so much missed from the last Quinlan
Opera Co., got some enthusiastic notices for his
recent work with the Raymond Roze Co. at Covent
Garden. Of his performance in “Tannhiiuser,” for
instance, a London critic wrote: “The honors went
to Mr. John Coates in the name part. It was pure
joy to listen to his vocal delivery, of the music, his
clear enunciation of English and his perfect phrasing.
To not a few of the audience the part was probably
a revelation, particularly the significance of Tann-
luiuser’s relation of his pilgrimage.” Which is a
good deal more than could be said for either of the
Tannhausers who were heard in the recent Quinlan
season. If the boom is to be repeated in 1915, the
co. will have to include efficient substitutes for
Coates and the stout soprano, Agnes Nicliolls, the
boss principals of the Wagnerian performances in
1912.
“Parisine”: Claretie, the brilliantly successful
director of the Theatre Frangais for 28 years, is dead.
The position is more difficult to fill than any other
theatrical management on earth, and few have held
it long. Four Paris theatres receive Government
subsidies —the Grand Opera, Opera Comique, Theatre
Francais and Odeon. Of course, this implies a high
standard. Yet the public is rebellious against the
schooling it gets, and finance is therefore apt to be
troublesome. The Grand Opera is the easiest to
manage, because nobody expects from it anything but
grand opera, by French composers as much as pos-
sible—Gounod, Halevy, Massenet, Paladilhe, Bizet
and Debussy. With the other subsidised theatres
there is a continual far between Government and
public. The managements are‘always stretching points
to meet the public, whereupon the Radicals declare
that the subsidies are absurd. They point to the
very greatest performers, such as Bernhardt and
Coquelin, having deserted the Comedie. The con-
sideration with them is, of course, merely financial,
and a subsidised theatre must struggle to be some-
thing more than that. So a Government-subsidised
theatrg has its own troubles, and is apt to lose the
services of the best actors and actresses.
“Melb”: Barry Lupino, of the “Forty Thieves”
pantomime, knew Fragson well. (Fragson is the
comedian who was shot dead in Paris the other
day by his demented father.) His real name was
Potts. He began with singing at London smoke
concerts. Then he went to Paris, and took a
waiter’s billet. He happened to bo at a soiree
given by a Parisian journalist, who liked to foster
rising talent. Coquelin was there. Fragson won
his approval with a song at the piano. This led to
his engagement at music-halls. He originated a
new style, which has been carried out by enter-
tainers like Spurr, Gammon and Margaret Cooper.
Or it might be called a revival of the old style of
Parry. He was handy at composition, and turned
English songs, quite fresh, into French, and French
into English. (His mother was a Frenchwoman.)
His success led to an engagement for the Drury Lane
pantomime, where he was welcomed for five seasons.
He broke the charm of the Principal Boy in “Cin-
derella” —was the hero of the pantomime ; its Waller
or Julius Knight. This led to the Principal Boy
being deposed in Australia for just one year, when
Lincoln acted Sinbad.
“Bald.y II.”: Strange it is to note of the French
lady artists who have won world-wide reputations for
wearing about as little as possible on the stage that
the more they put off their backs the more they put
on their bills. Here’s Gaby Deslys, for instance,
discussing the amount of money she finds it necessary
to spend on clothes. She cannot dress on less than
£14,000 a year. Then the beauteous Oecile Sorel
(be still, my fluttering heart!), of the Comedie Fran-
fiaise, has been offered a paltry £BOOO for a four-
months’ engagement in S. America. “What is
£8000?” asks Cecile —presumably of her dress-agent.
“My dresses and cloaks would cost me £4OOO alone.”
It’s a mystery to me when the Gabys and the
Ceciles wear these things.
“Private Boxer”: Many of the critical fraternity
have discovered that “Man and Superman” is “talky,”
and they are right. But what would they have said
had the “Hell” scene—which they regret has been
cut —been played ? Talk about talk ! The Federal
Parliament is a heaven of silence compared with it 1
But cut Shaw’s cackle, and where is he? He never
was a dramatist, and, judging by his latest works,
“Androcles and the Lion” and “Great Catherine”
(which might make money if re-christened “Cather-
ine Wheels” and turned into a Russian revue), there
is little hope of his ever becoming one. He is too
old to unlearn.
Elsie Stanley-llall, the Australian pianiste who has
been teaching for many years in England, has
married Dr. F. O. Stohr, of Northern Rhodesia. She
is the daughter of one of the patriarchs of the S. M.
Herald office.
“Gazer”: It’s genuine that McCormack made
£20,000 here. He deserved it. Bigger men than he
is, or ever will be, have only scored modestly, for
they came to sell us the last remnants of their musi-
cal stock. McCormack gave us the pick of his goods
—fresh and yet ripe. Some of that £20,000 was
for the compliment. It will do us good in bringing
us more artists in their golden prime.
“W. V. Penn”: They’re all wrong who, after going
to “Come Over Here,” have described Daisy Jerome’s
hair variously as auburn, ginger and red. The . day-
light color of her thatch is true terracotta, the tint
Burne-Jones never quite got with his brush. An
elder sister, Sadie, was the hit of the Prince of
Wales’s (London) burlesque, “Gentleman Joe,” in
April, 1895, playing Lalage Potts, a ’Murkan heiress,
who sang:—-
I’m spying around for an English lord
To marry me quick of his own accord ;
But the first that knocks my fancy—wa’al,
If he likes it or not, he’ll wed this gal!
He may fuss around and make a stir,
But I guess that wedding’s got to occur;
The almighty dollar would buy, you bet,
A superior class of co-ro-net.
Sadie was described as “a very pretty American brun-
ette, sparkling-eyed, with much nasal twang.” The
terracotta of Daisy’s hair is natural. Off stage she’s
more of the Continental sassiety ingenue than Cockney
or ’Murkan, and is a very dutiful daughter. Ma
travels with her.
“H. 0.”: A striking commentary on the importing
mania with which Australian theatrical firms are
afflicted is furnished by one of this year’s pantos.
For the principal “boy” and girl parts two over-
seas artists were engaged. Before the opening night
various songs which in the ordinary course would have
fallen to the principal “boy” were transferred to a
minor character, impersonated by an Australian. The
principal girl was preceded by a multitude of puff
pars. ; but before the first night her part had been
“cut” until there was scarcely any of it left, and
after that solitary appearance it was decided that a
whole army of press agents would not be able to con-
vince the public of the lady’s excellence, so she was
gently withdrawn.
Amongst the passengers by the Morea, which
reached Fremantle on the 30th, was J. M. Stevens,
well known in Sydney musical circles. A couple of
years ago his daughter Cecile won a scholarship at
the R.A.M., London, and Mr. Stevens migrated with
his entire family to keep the girl company while she
was doing her academy work. Last year, on a visit,
he brought some moving pictures—“ From Manger to
Cross,” among them —which sold well; and he is
trying his luck again with some other films.
“0.K.”: Recent “Poverty Point” mention of some
Australian boy performers whom the public accepted
as girls gave no place to Gus St. Leon, the most
audaciously successful he-maid of them all. Even a
Bulletin critic some years ago mistook Gus for
Gwendoline when he was perpetrating his harmless
fraud in Wirths’ Circus. Gus used to brave compari-
son by appearing with a real girl on either side of
him. The trio were billed as lady acrobats, Gus
being the champion soinersaulter of the beauteous
bunch. He was convincing until he outgrew the
deception and his tall figure seemed a bit over the
odds.

Mrs. Charles Bruce Marriott (Ida Lee,
daughter of the late George Lee, _ of
Bathurst, and grand-daughter of William
Lee. one of the first settlers on Bathurst
plains, and member for Roxburgh in the
first Legislative Assembly of N. S. Wales)
has been elected a Fellow of the Royal
Geographical Society in recognition of her
research work in the domain of early Aus-
tralian exploration. Mrs. Marriott’s accounts
of early voyages in the Southern Seas and
her “How the British Came to Australia”
are well known. Of Australian women she
lias been the most tireless in scratching
among dusty old documents.
“F.II.”: Literature-professor Wallace,
the imported brain-worker who was chosen
by the Melbourne University wiseheads in
preference to Murdoch, the Australian, has
unloaded a bitter complaint concerning the
Australian woman-student. His woe is that
discipline is subverted by the behavior of
the female student. “Women speak at lec-
tures in still, small voices,” he declared,
“and the noise is so faint that it can never
be located. When two or three of them get
going it is distinctly annoying. They have
a habit, too, of drooping hairpins on the
floor.” Pity the plaintive professor, “dis-
tinctly” annoyed by the dropping, hopping
hairpin and the tintinnabulating tongue of
the sweet girl-gossip —and imagine Mur-
doch, of Australia, voicing a similar com-
plaint !
“Clay Face” : Bitter is the rivalry of the
Marshall Hall Conservatorium and the
Melbourne University Conservatorium of
Music. So much of the bitterness belongs
to the latter that one of the pan-
jandrums of the University stated to the
press that the rival shop v/as about to close
down. The passing over of Ilarting and
Scharff to the University Conservatorium
was some corroboration of the exulting
statement, but the pioneer institution has
arisen to say publicly and in a loud voice
that it will continue to do business at the
old stand. Certainly the Albert-street fac-
tory has all the honors in the pro-
duction of artists. It started well with
Marshall Hall —a great and true musician,
for all his silly excursions into cheap and
fliprant verse; and Elise Weidermann-
Pinschof still challenges a rival in Aus-
tralia as a teacher of voice-production. Hall
must have had a great personality to stand
the assaults of the daily press and the
rivalry of the “official” concern; though he
was helped by the fact that Peterson —great
showman as he is—is less of a musician.
Fitz Hart, too, is a good successor to Mar-
shall Hall, and the Established Church,
which is the University Conservatorium, will
still be left with a smaller congregation than
the Albert-street Dissenters.
“Lud”: They are saying in the Best
Circles in England that the Duchess of
Marlborough isn’t playing the game. She
summoned a meeting of distinguished people
I —bishops, politicians, industrial heads and
so forth—at Sunderland Plouse, to consider
the Woman Suffrage question. The people
came, with an idea of orating pleasantly, as
a mere introduction to the real business of
champagne and strawberries. But they
found the platform occupied by 12 poor old
women, who did all the speaking. These
Twelve Apostles had had from 20 to 50 years
of cruel sweating. One held up a shirt, and
said : “I have to make a dozen of these for
ninepence.” Twenty years she had been at
that grind. Another, a widow in the con-
fectionery trade, said that for 20 years she
had never been able to spend more than
one penny on a meal. A woman showed a
pair of boot uppers. She makes 12 pairs
for tenpence. Another poor old creature
makes artificial butterflies and flowers at
tenpence a dozen —sold by the sweater for
Is. Gd. each. Another gets threepence a
gross for making match-boxes. Thus did
the Duchess of Marlborough plunge her
guests into England’s rotten economic sys-
tem. Then, to make matters worse, after
the Twelve Apostles of living death had had
their say, the hostess called up a statist.
He said : “These 12 poor old women typify
two millions, few of whom earn more than
12s. a week, and 300,000 earn much less.”
And now you can go home to your own
champagne and strawberries, said the lady
in effect, and think these things over.
THE LUCK OF IT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
My uncle, converted when lie was 99, lived a beauti-
ful life for two years, and died at 101.
—A visiting Evangelist in S. M. Herald.
Throughout the fevered days of youth,
He cherished young Desire,
Pursuing Pleasure, as she ran,
With wild, unholy fire.
Our local Wowser wagged his head,
And reckoned he were better dead.
Uncounted were the girls he kissed ;
Likewise the drinks he drank ;
A splendid time my uncle had
Though, morally, he sank
So deep in Error's murky swim
That Sin well-nigh encompassed him.
How different my sainted aunt!
A maiden lady, she,
Who spurned the love of lawless man
Till she was thirty-three,
And would have gone on, folks aver,
Had Love not 'then avoided her.
She neither drank, nor swore, nor smoked,
She would not go the pace;
Cold, unrelenting virtue shone
Like gaslight from her face;
Lonely and quite unmourned she died,
Esteemed by all the country-side.
Meanwhile my wretched uncle’s ways
Grew yearly worse and worse;
He sinned so hard that he became
A byword and a curse.
Withal he did not seem to mind;
A blither soul you could not find.
Although he swindled ev’ryone,
And, by this means, grew rich,
His eye was bright, his brow serene —■
Two circumstances which
Impressed me with suspicions dim
That Conscience did not worry him.
At ninety-eight his vigor failed ;
Flirtations rather palled ;
He took to sleeping long and deep;
The bar no longer called ;
He did not need to take folks down,
Being the richest man in town.
And presently he was acclaimed
A good and grand old man ;
One of those epic characters
Built on the British plan,
Who, in the , last analysis,
Have made the Empire what it is.
We saved his soul at ninety-nine;
For two whole years his life
Resembled that of some sweet child ;
Though wickedness was rife
On ev’ry side, he did not fall;
He spurned his tempters one and all.
And now my relative is dead,
And walking hand in glove
(Or so, at least, our parson claims)
With those who dwell Above.
Thus saith his tombstone, spick and span:
"He got there both ways—lucky man!”

SOCIETY
Thackeray tells how George the Fourth
in the prime of his powers invented a new
shoe-buckle : “A sweet invention ! lovely and
useful as the Prince on whose foot it
sparkled.” According to Sir William Mac-
gregor, the late King Edward made two
things very fashionable —one appendicitis ;
the other a new method of folding trousers.
His Ex. went on to express a wish that
the Prince of Wales, who has lately taken
to studying the bagpipes, “would make that
instrument popular.” Evidently Queens-
land’s Governor clearly appreciates the fine
things of -which the Guelph headpiece is
really capable.
PUZZLE-FIND THE BAD MAN!
Constable Williamson stated: “I brought him to
the police station, and placed him with three con-
stables in plain clothes for identification. The girl,
after looking at the men for from three to five
minutes, identified the accused.”
Senior-Constable Riley gave corroborative evidence.
Melbourne Police Court item.
A prize of a nickel-plated corkscrew is offered
to the reader whose correct solution of the above
problem is- first received at this office (accom-
panied, of course, by the usual 3d. in stamps
to defray postage, stationery, office boy’s labor,
etc., etc., etc.).
Another instance of Young Australia’s
tired feeling and lack of stamina! At Gil-
gandra (N.S.W.) a father and his son fell
70ft. through the staging of a well they
were repairing. Although badly damaged,
with a severe cut in the head which later on
called for several stitches, the son, a lad
of 16, lifted his stunned father out of the
water, and propped him up with broken
planks. Then he climbed up the pump pipe
to the top for a rope, descended with it, and
tied his father to the pipe. Up he climbed
then a second time, and cleared off in a
sulk-p for assistance. Thus Dad was rescued
with sound limbs but a severely injured
back. And, remember, the youngster who
did it —and probably didn’t think lie was
doing anything out of the way—had himself
just fallen the 70ft. and been so badly
knocked about that the doctor had to get to
work on him as soon as the father had been
seen to.
“Briner”: The Belgian training-ship
E’Avenir, now lying at the Melbourne
Wharf, gives us a lesson. “Avenir” means
“future” ; and the ship, a grand four-masted
barque, means that Belgium is determined
to have a navy. The ship, built in 1908 by
public subscription, was presented to the
Government, which uses it for training pur-
poses, and pays some of the expenses by
carrying cargo. Timber and pig-iron were
brought to Melbourne, and a wheat cargo
will be taken back. There are between 4 )
and 50 cadets aboard. After they are
trained they will have to enter the mercan-
tile service, as the navy will not be ripe;
but they will be qualified naval officers and
ready for the. fruition of the scheme. Ger-
many, indeed, has intimated that it will be
willing to take them into its navy straight
away if Belgium agrees. And probably soitie
will go whether their nation agrees or not,
for their training is intensely valuable.
Why not a few such Australian ships? Our
trade could do with them, as the disclosures
in the produce business clearly show.

A seaside holiday crowd mostly makes
its own amusements, but the one at
Brighton Beach (Vic.) on Boxing Day was
largely assisted by unwilling caterers or
entrepreneurs. One of them, a cheerful
collector of odd sixpences, was exhibiting
what he openly designated a “Burlesque
Wild Man from Borneo” ; but the obvious-
ness of the old fake failed to appeal to
some humorless amusement-hunters, who
capsized the tent, dismantled the wild man
and chased him into the desert country
around the police station, and then gathered
up the too-deliberate showman and deposited
him in the bay. Heaven knows why they
did these things ; this writer has seen bur-
lesques at city theatres that were much
bigger take-downs than the “wild man.” but
he never heard of a theatrical manager
being dumped in a horse-trough. Picture
shows are evidently creating a dainty,
finicky taste in the public.
“Carmine”: They will persist in begin-
ning at the wrong end with the Australian
National Portrait Gallery. Don’t, I say,
work backwards; work forwards. In other
words, start with the oldest justified claims.
This is the safe plan. Otherwise we shall
have an appalling lot of nobodies, until
there will be a rubbish heap of unknown
Smiths, Browns, Joneses and Robinsons.
I don’t object to Hopetoun, Barton. Deakin,
Reid, Parkes, Kingston or Griffith. But
why such as Tennyson, Gould, Turley,
Salmon and McDonald? If these men
prove their greatness by the test of about
40 years, well and good. The foundation
of a National Gallery lies in such as Cook,
Macquarie, Macarthur. Wentworth, Lang,
Higinbotham. Sturt, Stuart, Kendall and
Gordon. This was the principle in the
London National Gallery. It did not even
bevin by hurrying up with such living men
as Disraeli and Gladstone, but laid the
basis with such as Bacon, Newton, Shak-
speare. Milton, Cromwell, Chatham, Pitt,
Fox, Burke, Byron and Scott.
William Redmond, brother of John E., is
now paying his fifth visit to Australia. Ilis
first visit, 30 years ago, raised pandemo-
nium. He and brother John went round
with the Home Rule hat and had hopes of
filling it. But Sydney was in a spiteful
humor at the time, and hall after hall was
shut against them. They pushed their de-
posit money for the Town Hall slyly into
the office; but when the Council understood
the matter the cash was fired back with
wrath. Several hotels refused them meals,
and Old-Man Parkes urged the Legislative
Assemblv to order the deportation of Willie
as a convicted criminal. The younger
brother had, it is true, been in gaol in Ire-
land, but he was run in on suspicion, not
after trial. Since then he has been really
in gaol—three times, in fact —because of his
orations and other patriotic noises. The
brothers on that first visit succeeded in get-
ting the old Academy of Music in Castle-
reagh-street. and there the hat was well
filled. At the same time Willie first became
an M.P.: a vacancy occurred in Wexford,
and he was elected in his absence to the
House of Commons. The later visits were not
so full of storm, and the bright young man
was able to combine business with love-
making.
“F.H.” : The Opticians’ Bill, hung up by
the Victorian Parliament (B. 25/12/T3),
proposed to deal out legal stoush to the un-
oualified eye-tinker. But the brummy opti-
cian is a mere trifle compared with the
brummy physician. Dr. Springthorpe. pre-
siding the other day over a dental-degree
ceremonial, recalled that it is against the
law for anybody to pull teeth or mend them
f r money, unless registered under the new
Act; nevertheless, so long as he does not
call himself a doctor, any miserable grave-
THE REASONS WHY.

filler may practise medicine in general with-
out the slightest fear of being fined or
quodded. Parliament, in short, has made
some attempt to protect the Victorian citi-
zen’s teeth by law, and has reached within
3ft. or so of protecting his eyes also ; but it
permits his ears, nose, kidneys, pancreatic
juice, peritoneum and other items to be
ignorantly dealt with for cash by any death-
dealing parasite whose impudence can get
him the job.

A hairy man of auburn hue got himself
drowned in the Yarra near Princes Bridge
on New Year’s Day. It was an after-
luncheon tragedy, and the circumstances
were singular. The hairy one emptied his
trousers pockets of eighteenpence, gave the
money to somebody for safe keeping, and
sprang from the Yarra bank into the river.
He could swim like a duck, but his clothes
were an evident drawback ; so three rescue
parties went after him in rowing boats.
One boat with a policeman in it overtook
the swimmer, and the constable made a grab
at him. Unfortunately the hairy adventurer
sank right there, never to rise again. He
had been drinking, of course ; all the same,
it was not beer that brought this absurd
person to his watery grave. He died of
being an expert swimmer. Nobody who
couldn’t swim a yard would have met his
death in that particular way. Alas! how
many drowning fatalities during these hot
summer months are due to the victims’
knowledge of swimming !
S HE: " How did you get on ?”
HE: “ Rotten! He says I couldn’t even keep
you in dresses.”
S HE: " Steady, old boy. Just you wait a bit
and I’ll lay in a supply before we’re
married.”
The dentist has tinkered expensively with
most mouths, and two persons out of every
three chew steak warily for fear of wreck-
ing some of the interior fittings and being
rendered more or less incoherent while re-
pairs are carried out. What wouldn’t most
of us with gold-fangs give for the natural
bite of the Finnish sailor, who, during his
holiday-time struggle with a Sydney police-
man, bit the constable’s foot through the
regulation boot!
One of the late millionaire
Morgan’s millionaire daughters
has started a class in New York
to teach poor girls how to fur-
nish a home on £2O and main-
tain it economically when it is
furnished. Now is the time for
a sweated shirt-waist maker,
with 7s. a week, to start teach-
ing daughters of millionaires
how to live decently on £50,Q00
per annum.
Poor Chidley, Sydney’s persistent skirted-
dress reformer, had another brief trip to the
Reception House recently. Just about the
same time hot, blanketed Scotchmen were
blowing screams through the bagpipes and
bidding for heat apoplexy by performing the
old tribal prances in front of a meek, trou-
sered audience at the Agricultural Show
Ground. Tradition enables a man or a class
to do things that bring swift retribution to
the daring pioneer. If only he had been born
McChidley, and peddled haggis in tins instead
of “The Answer” !

It is a hopeless age for the Christmas
reveller who tries to live up to the imported
mistletoe and rum-punch traditions of the
season. A jolly Britisher (the charge-sheet
said “Drunk and disorderly”) ventured to
roar “The Mistletoe Bough” on a Manly
tram on Boxing Day. Years ago the rol-
licking old ditty would have carried him
through; but a sober, whispering load
of strangers looked at him sourly, and when
he heartilv wished them and the tram in-
spector the compliments of the season, and
audaciously shook the inspector’s hand, he
wrote his own summons, so to speak. The
world doesn’t throw up its hat as it used to.
Hear the cable talking about the older citi-
zens of New York who stood on the corners
of streets and whooped defiantly because
New Year’s Eve wasn’t riotous enough to
please them !

Woman’s figure this autumn will resemble nothing
so much as an elongated pear. —Fashion note.
Some time ago she seemed a dainty peach,
In pink perfection rounded sweetly;
And, as we gazed, we felt no mortal shape
Could ever twine itself in lovelier drape,
Or trip along more fairy-featly.
It seemed, in fact, the rankest heresy
To e’er deny or even doubt it;
And if a critic cavilled at the curve
Of swelling grace, we marvelled at his nerve,
And told him what we thought about it.
But, lo ! to-day the blushing peach has passed,
And Delia tapers from her snowy shoulder
Down to her twinkling ankles; and you share
The vision of a finely-fashioned pear—
A wonder-work of Fashion’s moulder.
From peach to pear, perchance from pear she’s
passing
To some quaint guise of “pine” or fig or mango,
Secure, by some deep spell, to charm us all,
And proud to prove, howe’er the fashions fall,
How far upon this idol-loving ball
Our dainty Delia can go.

A HOLIDAY SONG.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Oh, lam sick of the city noises! Wheels and ham-
, mers and raucous cries
Make me long for the wind’s brave music—make me
wish for the sea’s clean skies !
Out of the mess of dust and paper, out of the heat
and work and fret,
I would go on an out-bound steamer on a mission
of loafing set.
Never a ship goes down the harbor, nosing her lonely
way to sea,
But I wish I was safe aboard her, getting away from
Monotony,
Getting away from prim timetables —getting away
from the clocks and rules,
Dodging the everlasting clatter made “by a million
other fools.
Leaving the bills and work and worry, shoving the
mess of Life aside;
Steaming out on a good ship briskly where the out-
look is clean and wide !
Hear the beat of the busy engines! Hear the snap
of a wind-whipped llag !
Now the sinews of Joy are tightened, and the city’s
a distant hag.
Watch the crone in her smoke-haze sinking where
the sky and the water merge.
Then, oh then, turn a glad face seaward as she
lifts to the first blue surge!
Now with the ocean gates before you, let your
thoughts and your heart go fr.e!
Here at hand for your Youth’s renewing is God’s
valorous, sounding sea!

The Kirk got a bad advertisement the
other day in Victoria, when a parson’s wife
prosecuted a youth for stealing a sovereign
she had given him to put on a horse. It
turned out that the lady was a habitual,
almost a professional, punter. She had
been punting for nine years, and declared
she was driven to it by the fact that the
Kirk did not pay her husband sufficient to
keep himself, let alone her. The money she
won was used in maintaining the home. It
was a remarkable case altogether, but not
the least remarkable part of it was that
there is one person in Australia, and a
woman at that, who, according to her own
story, makes a profit out of backing horses.
VAUDEVILLE STANG.
FIRST ROSEBUD (sotto voce): “Hey, Pearlie!
T’wig the ole nark in the front rank with
the bald top-piece wot's guying us? ”
SECOND ROSEBUD: “Yairs."
F.R.: “Has he got any dough? ”
S.R.: “Dough! No charnce! Why, while I
was out with ’ini t'other night ’e bit me
for a tray bit to buy a pint in a bottle to
cart 'onie."
After a calm survey :
Three of the “Commonwealth portraits” are at
last approved by the “Art Advisory Board,” and are
on view to the public in Queen’s Hall, Parliament
House, Melbourne. Of the three, one only can be
said to be of much artistic interest. This is the
half-length of Henry Parkes, by Julian Ashton —a
remarkable piece of character painting; vigorous in
handling, fine in color. Ambrose Patterson’s King-
ston was painted from a photograph, and hardly gave
the artist an opportunity to spread himself. The
figure is somewhat stiff on the legs, but the color
is warm and pleasing, and makes Meldrum’s bewigged
portrait of Chief Justice Griffith look corpse-like.
Indeed, the hands of the latter are those of an
Egyptian mummy. Meldrum has used effectively the
safe academic posture and accessories—leather couch,
Brussels carpet and all —and apart from its un-
pleasant and creepy flesh tints, is as effective as most
of the thousands of official portraits one sees. Fox’s
portrait of Fisher has not shown up so far.
ALIVE WITH CORPSES.
WAVBACK JOHN HOP (called upon to report state of water hole that had been rushed by

Though the rain seems to be holding off,
there was a heavy fall of Sydney tram pas-
sengers the other evening. The brakes of
one of Johnson’s cars failed on one of the
screaming, downhill curves, and, as there
was a stationary car in front of the run-
away, the long slide ended in a deafening
crash. Next instant the atmosphere rained
four tram conductors, two domestic ser-
vants and an elderly lady who evidently
thought it was a disgraceful affair, because
she refused to give her name, and was
driven home in the most respectable cab
available. Neither of the domestic servants
was broken, thank Heaven !
“Adelaide”: The late Jonah Hobbs, of
suburban Campbelltown (S.A.), has left an
estate of £36,700, all made out of his garden
on the Torrens bank. And he is far from
being the only capitalist in that line. Ade-
laide producers cannot understand why so
much of the rest of Australia thinks it can’t
grow a cabbage without the aid of a China-
man, or why it should be thought less hon-
orable to supply one’s fellow-men with beans
than with beef. The rows of fine waggons
and teams outside the Markets any market
morning are ocular demonstration of an in-
dustry kept White, with solid profit to the
keepers.
* * * *
During the Christmas season of brotherly
love and Christian charity, when citizens
were forgiving their friends and trying to
forget their enemies, the Melbourne police,
while suffused with doubts about the genu-
ineness of all this palaver, were much exer-
cised over Sarah McEacharn. There was
nothing specially wrong with Sarah. She
was sane and fairly healthy; but the Law
had laid the hand of correction on her, and
was in a tangle in consequence. Sarah
came under restraint away back in Novem-
ber through throwing herself into the
Yarra, and would have accomplished her
purpose but for the usual interfering small
bov. who rescued her at considerable risk.
The Law patted the youth on the back and
locked Sarah up on a charge of attempting
suicide. The lady, brought into court, cheer-
fully admitted the charge, and assured the
Law that she was sick and tired of life, and
would, if released, carry out her intention
thoroughly and finally. The shocked beaks
remanded her for a week to think it over.
At the end of that time she was still more
firmly convinced of the futility of things,
so the Law recommended a “home,” with
plenty of wash-tub. But the unregenerate
Sarah declined any “home”; she preferred
gaol. After that the Law kept on remand-
ing her until Christmas, when it thought of
her relations. She owned up to sons and
daughters, but knew the whereabouts of only
one, a girl, who wasn’t in a position to
assist her and had troubles enough of
her own, anyhow; so her address was dis-
remembered, too. After that Sarah was
remanded some more, until she finally
wearied of the procrastination and demanded
discharge or gaol. So the Law told her to
go about her business and keep away from
the Yarra. As her remains were fished out
of that stream a few days later, it is evi-
dent she considered herself superior to the
Law’s advice. Yet it is a pity she was
wasted. Very few women keep their pro-
mises so conscientiously.
“See-Gee”: Thus a recent issue of the
official Church of England Messenger in
Victoria
Is it salvation which Professor Ehrlich has dis-
covered in an antidote to diseases which spring from
immoral practices? It will be a godsend to the
innocent sufferers, the children of a libertine and
such-like. It will be a very Devil’s gift if Salvarsan
or “606” means total immunity from the physical
ill-effects of immorality, for then a man may sin
with impunity! And the downward path is easier
for woman, too, who may indulge passion without
penalty, thanks to a drug-store or similar device.
If the Second Commandment’s penalty is thus
evaded, and there are no children suffering innocently
for parents’ sins, there is that one less check at all
events to sin. And we have gone a step further and
abolished by our science the retribution which Nature
exacts from the self-indulgent, sinful human body.
For unmixed diabolism, that eruption is
almost unsurpassable. Nature _ does not
“exact” syphilis any more than it “exacts”
influenza; and not even a church has been
insane enough thus far to denounce any-
thing that would cure influenza. As for the
contention that the universe is likely to
rush the charms of the syphilis scourge now
that it has found a cure, surely this is about
the limit in imbecility. Up to date, has
the Messenger noticed people wallow-
ing to any extent in filth just for the plea-
sure of being cured of a resultant filth dis-
ease?

“Gordon G.”: Cabled that the English
Appeal Court has decided that, by both
Common and Statute Law, the dearer sex
is precluded from practising at the Bar or
elsewhere in the six-and-eight profession. So
the Law in the Fog retains its conservative
old character and stands out as being about
the only trade, business, calling, job or pas-
time which bangs the door on woman’s nose.
The Judges, being a discreet body of men,
seem to have refrained from even hinting at
any reason for their decision, other than
that they were there to administer the Law
as it stood, and without any personal feel-
ing. But the reason is fairly obvious.
Stated baldly, it
is this: they con-
sidered that the
female part of the
community has
not as good brains
as the hairier sex,
and that only the
best brains are
good enough for
the Law. Which
being so, a good Providence only knows
what a lot of us who more or less practise
the profession are doing in it.

Evans, M.L.C., Minister for Health in the
17-day Victorian Labor Ministry, approved
of I-lealth-OfScer Robertson’s recommenda-
tion to municipalise the milk supply, with a
separate and specially-guarded supply for
infants. Under Dr. Robertson’s scheme
supply farms are to be specially selected,
and the municipality takes charge of the
testing, pasteurising, bottling and distribu-
tion of the milk in sealed and sterilised
bottles, one distribution per 24 hours being
thus made sufficient. Milk for infants is to
be delivered in “one-feed size” bottles, and
there is to be a regular visitation of houses
by trained nurses to instruct mothers in
artificial feeding and to report on the chil-
dren artificially fed. Provision is made for
the free supply of milk to children whose
parents are unable to pay. After the intro-
duction of a similar supply scheme in
Rochester (N.Y.) the deaths of children in
July and August decreased by 50 per cent,
in nine years, although the population in
that period increased 20 per cent. It will
cost some money to municipalise this pure-
milk scheme, but its profits are enormous
and certain. In the once-a-day distribution
alone and the related fact that four rival
milk-vendors will no longer supply eight
houses in the one street, there is a dividend.
But the greatest profit will be in the saving
of child life. A high birth-rate is valueless
if the newborn dies of a dirty bottle within
six months.

“Chasuble”: There has been another de-
velopment of the Wroeite business. After
Wroe died in Fitzroy (Melb.), Fisher, “the
Nunawading Messiah,” tried to succeed the
other prophet, but could only rope in 120
Wroeites for his Church of the Firstborn.
The others repudiated him. The sect, which
had become numerous in England and
America, agreed on a new leader, an ex-
soldier named White, who christened him-
self Jezreel. He managed to raise about
£40,000, with which he built an immense
edifice, known as Jezreel’s Tower, on top of
Chatham Hill, near London. All were to
be gathered in this on the last day. When
he died his wife carried on the business as
Queen Esther. The American gang, how-
ever, disputed her right, and sent over a
leader called Prince Michael, who tried to
wrest the tower from Esther. Probably
they squared it; anyway, the tower has
been for sale, on representations that it
would make an excellent brewery. And at
last a deal is effected —Jezreel’s Tower is to
be a picture theatre! Another fine pro-
perty of the denomination is, or has been,
Meloourne House, Ashton, Yorkshire, built
in Wroe’s lifetime, with money subscribed
mostly in Fitzroy, where the Wroeites, or
Christian Israelites, still keep going in their
large, bluestone church. Visiting it on a
recent Sunday night, I found good preach-
ing of a Methodist order. The Wroeites
keep to their long hair rolled up behind and
their peculiar low-crowned belltoppers, while

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
London, Tuesday morning.—Sir Ernest Shackleton
is arranging another expedition to solve the problem
of the Continental nature of the Antarctic.— Cable.
No man who has not actually experienced it can
realise what the call of the Antarctic i 5.... We
didn’t have a bad time at a11....We had a good
stock of literature, mostly books of travel and novels,
and we used to play chess, draughts and bridge.
During the short daytime we had a little hockey or
football. We had plenty of provisions. All we had
to do was to go out and get ice—good hard ice—-
for fresh water.
—Story of an Antarctic habitue, told in March, 1913.
I am the newspaper reader wearily trying to cover
Snow tracks of rival explorers, who must incessantly
hover
Where there are glaciers and bergs. Why should we
lend them assistance,
So they may go and play hockey? Here! let’s make
a gallant resistance!
Stifle their frosty heroics! Bust up their ice cliffs
and blizzards !
Why should we pay for their penguins and what
they have in their gizzards?
What shall it profit subscribers, sweating for coin at
their steady
Jobs, till the tale of the starving and freezing and
dragging is ready?
Why should we sweat for their freeze and the wreck
of some cranky appliance
Smashed by a blizzard “down South” ? In the name
of the god we call Science !
Oh, Blither! And Bunkum ! And Bosh ! Why, this
snow-tramping’s merely a hobby—-
A sort of cool scramble for fame and the freedom
from work that’s too jobby ;
A clear get-away from the Monday to Saturday road
that we travel;
A break from convention and bills, and the little
knots we must unravel.
Antarctic exploring be blowed ! I tell you I’d just
like to try it!
Let’s have medals for plain, summer work and the
heroes like us who stand by it!

we’ll make up with one of ’em, and stay for good.”

The Mayor of Rome —the Eternal City—
for the past six years has been a Cockney
Jew named Nathan.
Westralia’s newest Rhodes scholar is a
20-year-old Gawler, a great-grandson of S.
Australia’s second Governor —the man who
got things into the mess that Hori Grey
was later on called in to straighten out.
The Y.C. heroes haven’t a monopoly of
nerve. Charles Fermino, a pumper in. the
Long Tunnel mine, at Walhalla (Vic.),
took hold of a sagging wire to put it in
place, and caught the full force of the cur-
rent it was carrying. ‘‘Don’t touch me,” he
said, as a rush was made to release him,
and coolly instructed his mate to cut the
current off. By the wildest freak of luck
the wires fused, and a life was saved that
may do Australia a lot of good if a big
crisis comes.
LAV. BONYTHON, the just-retired Mayor
of Adelaide.
“Tim” Coghlan, N. S. Wales Agent-
General in London, once a great statistician,
is now a small knight. Timothy is a
Sydney native, born in Campbell-street 58
years ago. His wife is a daughter of the
late Denis Donnelly, of Cowra, who was
M.L.A. for the district from 1891 to 1896.
Dr. Isa Coghlan is a sister, and his brothers
include Dr. Coghlan, the N.S.W. barrister,
and F. A. Coghlan, the permanent head of
the Chief Secretary’s Department. To George
Dibbs is due the credit of having discovered
Tim’s bent for figures, and effecting his
transfer from the job of works engineer to
fhat of Government Statist, in which he
shone as never another Australian had be-
fore him.
Bishop Moorliouse, Bishop of Melbourne
from 1876 to 1886, and afterwards the
Principal Gaiters of Manchester, gave a
garden party at his home in Devonshire on
November 19 to liven up his 87th birthday.
Ironical fate decreed that Robert Harper,
ex-M.H.R., who has always frowned at the
Gambling Evil in Melbourne, should receive
a testimonial from his old constituents at
Hanging Rock racecourse on New Year’s
Day. A platform was erected under the
trees, nigh the track, and during an interval
between races Robert took the platform to
receive the cheers of the electors of Mernda.
After the function they returned their atten-
tion to the Gambling Evil, and their former
member presumably wished them luck. It
is impossible for even an elder of the kirk
to touch politics without being defiled.
Judge Murray, Lieut.-Gov. of Papua, who
has been merely C.M.G.’d, is son of the
late Terence Aubrey Murray, one-time
Speaker of the N. S. Wales Legislative
Assembly and President of the Legislative
Council, and grandson of Terence Murray,
who had a station at Lake George as far
back as 1820. The present Lieut.-Gov., a
fine athlete in his early days, was called to
the Bar in England in 1886, and practised
in Sydney. His knowledge of law, with his
fine physique, his military experience gained
as Colonel of the Irish Rifles and otherwise,
and the fact that he is 6ft.-odd of fervently
patriotic Australian, made his appointment
°s Lieut.-Gov. of Papua extremely proper
and highly popular.
Neil Elliott Lewis, who is to be made a
Judge of the Supreme Court of Tasmania,
was born on October 27, the anniversary of
Captain Cook’s birthday, 55 years ago. He
is a graduate of Oxford and a barrister of
the Inner Temple. The Lewis family first
arrived in Tasmania in 1815. The pioneer
was Richard Lewis, the new judge’s
grandfather, who went into commercial and
industrial pursuits. N. E. Lewis got his
early education at the High School in. the
Hobart Domain, for which James Anthony
Froude, the historian, was once engaged
as rector, but was “scratched” when the
authorities discovered he had written “The
Nemesis of Faith.” Lewis is a Balliol
College man, and worked under Benjamin
Jowett, the Greek scholar. He has been in
politics since 1886, when he was elected to
the Assembly for Richmond. In 1899 he
became Premier and Attorney-General; in-
cidentally, he was one of the framers of the
Commonwealth Constitution. His wife is a
relative of the late Dr, Richard Youl, who
for a couple of generations was City Coroner
of Melbourne.
Andrew Agnew, of Melbourne, an ancient
and well-known Irish Presbyterian, is re-
ported to have sent Christmas greetings of
a bloodthirsty nature to Carson the Revo-
lutionary. In his cable, Agnew told Carson
to count on the help of Victorian Ulster-
men “if trouble comes,” and advised him
that his “splendid work” was being watched
with “admiration and sympathy.” As Car-
son’s work has so far consisted largely in
urging his countrymen to armed resistance
of Home Rule, it would appear that, imme-
diately following the outbreak of inter-
Irish hostilities, Andrew Agnew is prepared
to put on his war-boots and make for Ire-
land by the first boat. In the calm of pri-
vate life the prospective swashbuckler is a
solid pillar of Scots’ Church, in Collins-
street, where the big bank-balances are. In
business he is a wholesale ironmonger, pro-
fitably and peaceably providing coach-
builders with the metal parts of their
vehicles, and. by reason of something he did
some years ago, owning a top-level reputa-
tion as a white man in financial matters.
Died at Marrickville, on Saturday,
Adolphus Philip Clapin, 1.5.0., aged 85.
Mr. Clapin entered the public service of
N. S. Wales as assistant-clerk in the Lands
Department under Lieut.-Colonel Barney,
R.E., in 1850. Two or three years later he
was transferred to Parliament House as
Clerk of Records, what time Charles Nichol-
son was Speaker and Richard O’Connor
first clerk, and his address was Parliament
House until his retirement in 1907. An
interesting picture of more or less historic
personages was taken on May 23, 1887, on
a lawn of Parliament House, on the occa-
sion of a dinner given by Henry
Parkes to the survivors of the first Assem-
bly. There were then 21 living. Three
-—Daniel Cooper, George Macleay and
Thomas Holt —were in England, and died
there; one, Henry Buckley, was in Queens-
land. Four —James Garland, F. T. Rusden,
Richard Hargrave ‘ind John Richardson—
were in the New England district; the re-
maining 13 were living in or near Sydney.
All near Sydney, except A. T. Holroyd,
who was very ill and died three weeks after-
wards, were present at the banquet, and
are in the picture. There were Henry
Parkes, William Montagu Manning, William
Macleay, W. B. Dailey, W. R. Piddington,
jHin Robertson, G. H. Cox, Edward Flood.
•T. N. Oxley, John Hay. Richard Jones and
Peter Faucett. In addition there were J.
J. Calvert, Clerk of the Parliaments, and
the just-deceased A. P. Clapin, Clerk Assis-
tant, who had been officers of the House
when Responsible Government came along.
J. J. Calvert, now in his 84th year, is the
sole survivor of the Parliament and the
banquet.
I'ut this at least to the credit of Captain
Jacky Evans, the more-or-less new Speaker
of the Tasmanian Assembly—he has refused
to heat his head with the useless flummery
of a wig.
THE WHOLE STAFF PROCEEDS TO

Died on Christmas Day, William Stephen,
aged 85, who represented Redfern and
Botany in the ’9o’s in N. S. Wales Assem-
bly. He was a Freetrader, and supported
Parkes and Reid in turn, although he was
one of the founders of the fiscally-handi-
capped tannery industry. However, he
lived for 56 years in Botany, so that he had
plenty of time to repent.
“Tennyson Cole, the portrait painter,
has,” the cable says, “been fined £lO or a
month for beating Mrs. Roycroft, the wife of
a surgeon, who was sitting for her portrait.
Cole said he had been married twice and
knew how to manage women.”
His medium is oils, but he
Does not stick to convention’s ruts;
When subjects show stupidity
He illustrates them all with “cuts.”
Died at Perth last week Thomas Duggan,
aged 92 years, the last but one of 60
“Fenians” transported in 1868. Duggan,
who had been a National School teacher at
Ballincallig, Co. Cork, became prominent in
the I.R. brotherhood, was convicted of sedi-
tion, and after two years in Portland prison
was sent to Fremantle in the ship Houge-
mont. On the expiration of his sentence
he became a country school-master.
South Aus. kept its 77th birthday last
week, on the beach at Glenelg, where Gover-
nor Hindmarsh, landing from . the Buffalo,
read his proclamation of a new “province”
on December 28, 1836. This year’s roll was
signed by one man (James Chittleborough)
and two women who actually came in the
Buffalo, and another woman who was in the
infant settlement before the ship arrived.
As for the “pioneers”—any one born or
arriving not later than 1840 —over a hundred
of them were at hand.
A somehow pathetic sight these times is
Thomas Playford, politician from boyhood,
several times Premier of S.A., and ex-
Federal Minister. He is ex-everything now
—has even'left his splendid market-garden
in the Hills, and fills in time as director of
the East End market. In the flowing frock-
coat he always wears he looks like a pai’son,
but a light felt hat destroys that illusion.
Generally walking alone, he seems to be
thinking of past battles. And lie could fight
—the way in which he stood up to Parkes
at the first Federation conference made some
history.
From “J.K.M.” :
It was Charles Bradlaugh who taught the Labor
people of Geelong the trick of delivering a prohibited
speech from a boat moored a few yards out from
shore. In (or about) 1861, Bradlaugh, who had
been lecturing in Plymouth, was invited to lecture in
Devenport Park on a Sunday. As soon as he
tried to speak he was arrested. He returned and
was re-arrested. In court he declared that lie would
deliver the address; and he circulated “dodgers” to
that effect. At the appointed time “Charlie” was
there. So was the crowd ; also the Superintendent
with 28 policemen. Even some soldiers were held
in readiness to quell any riot that might'result. But,
instead of stopping in the park, Bradlaugh led the
crowd to Stonehouse Creek, a small tributary of the
Tamar. Here he embarked on a small boat, rowed
out to a larger boat moored within 9ft. of the
shore, and began his lecture. A few minutes later
the Superintendent and his police burst through the
crowd; but when they saw the position they col-
lapsed. The Superintendent tried to get even with
the boat owner; but the boat had been hired previ-
ously, and the owner had no knowledge of the pur-
pose for which it was to be used. Charles Bradlaugh
knew a little about law.
Captain Bruce, of the Torres pilot ser-
vice, finds half-mile margins in 20-minute
courses mere jokes compared with some of
his experiences in “sail.” He was mate of
the ship Garston when she foundered in
mid-ocean, and the captain (Pye)
and 11 men, including the two
mates, were four weeks in an open
boat with a few tins of bully-beef
and enough water to swear by.
On the 20th day after leaving the
wreck the provisions were down to
two tins of meat, and the desperate
crew demanded the lot. Annesty,
the other mate, lay in the bottom
of the boat stupefied by exhaustion,
and Pye and Bruce held the food
against the madmen. Said Pye:
“I’ll throw it overboard first. You
fools ! Our only chance is in mak-
ing the rations last out. If you
eat it all to-dav what will you do
to-morrow?” To which one of the
foreigners replied : “Dere is blenty
of dwo-lekked animalse,” and the
sinister proposal took possession of
the men. Pye and Bruce deter-
mined to capsize the boat and let
all drown together if any attempt,
to kill one of the company fol-
lowed on the proposed casting of
lots, though certainly, lot or no
lot, the choice would have fallen
on Annesty—the most exhausted of
them all. For days captain and
mate kept discipline, in the adher-
ence to the ration scale at least;
and before the scant provision was quite
exhausted the wrecked men sighted land.
After that experience trouble with even a
wild Marine Board doesn’t amount to much.
George V.’s semi-annual branding saw
four Maorilanders decorated with the
pathetic totem marks. Charles Bowen, the
oldest (83), had K.C.M.G. tacked on to
him; but it won’t give him a more gentle
character, nor make him a more able Speaker
of the Legislative Council. Ernest Ruther-
ford, the youngest (42) and most-distin-
guished, was marked K. 8., but it is un-
likely that his great promise in scientific
research will slump on that account. John
Shand, of Otago University, found himself
traced C.M.G., yet it will add not one grain
to his storehouse of knowledge regard-
ing educational matters. Premier Massey
was passed along the P.C. token, which
might stand for Politically Conservative,
but more likely just means the old Petty
Compliment.
PRENDERGAST,
of the Vic. Labor
'parly, denounces
Watt and his works.
Arthur Bristowe, dead in Adelaide after a
long and plucky fight with lingering disease,
was one of that city’s best-known share-
brokers, though he specialised lately in com-
panies’ secretarial work. He was business
manager of the Associated in Kalgoorlie at
one time, secretary to the Fire Brigades
Board of S.A.. and pretty well everything
one can be in the accountancy line. He was
only 44 when he passed out.
A RHYME OF SILKEN FETTERS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The new Governor of Victoria “has been married
eight years, and is the father of three children, but
he does not look so much the family man.’’
—Age (1/1/14).
He was a sprightly sort of bloke
Who did not mumble as he spoke;
Nor did he humbly hang his head,
Habitually depressed. Instead,
With quick, elastic step he went
Upon his way, his back unbent;
His teeth were still a perfect set,
Nor was he bald at all. And yet—■
Believe it if you can —
He was a married man !
His coat was neither crudely cut,
Nor threadbare, nor old-fashioned, but
Quite smart; and, though he was not stout,
His shoulder-blades did not stick out
As married men’s so often do.
He was nowise a person who
Appeared downtrodden by his Fate,
Nor driven dully desperate.
Astonishing that he
A married man should be !
No scent of cheap tobacco clung
Persistently his clothes among;
No home-clipned whiskers grew around
His chin. His shoes were new and sound.
To judge by the sweet socks he wore,
He was a dashing bachelor —
A merry, careless soul whose will
Was never crossed by woman’s. Still,
Despite his manner bright,
Married he was, all right!
VICTORIA.

The WILD CAT
COLUMN
The principal feature of the half-year’s
Treasury accounts for N. S. Wales is, as usual of late,
the perfectly mad loan expenditure. This amounted
to £4,478,428, or £248,300 more than in the cor-
responding half of the previous year. If this money
was going into businesses which would earn interest
on the capital the position would not he so bad ;
but, as the official figures show, even the railways
are not now earning interest, so rapidly have work-
ing exes, gone up, and so heavily has the department
been loaded of late with unprofitable lines. More-
over, if the interest on the capital spent on unopened
lines were added to the bill—as it ought to be-*-the
position would be still worse. However, the Govern-
ment appealed to the country asking whether the
drunk should continue; and —quite naturally, of
course—the unsober multitude said Yes. It isn't
much of a time to ask a man whether he will have
a sixth drink when he’s had a fifth. Certainly he
will, and hang the expense! Fill-’em-up-again—and
the baby pays. But the baby isn’t going to do all
the paying. Treasurer Cann, who, by all accounts,
is to be succeeded presently by Treasurer Holman,
has evidently got tired of the worry of floating 12
months’ bills, and has just had a long loan of
£3,000,000 underwritten in London. It is not repay-
able for 28 years and upwards. But it carries 4 p.c.
and is issued at 96 ; so the other way of putting it
is that for 28 .years and upwards the country is
committed to pay £4 7s. p.c. for money, as against
the average rate of £3 10s. sd. for N. S. Wales
loans outstanding on June 30, 1911. That is the
price this country has to pay for carrying out works
at a time when the money market is such that no
sane or knowledgable Government would borrow more
'than it could possibly help.
N. S. Wales State revenue for the half-
year was £8,300,884, or £825,555 more than in the
corresponding half of 1912. The expenditure charged
to revenue account was £8,965,097. That is to
say, the revenue wasn’t sufficient to pay ordinary out-
goings (apart from loan works) by £664,213.' That
looks pretty dreadful ; still it is not quite as bad as
the position was 12 months ago. The deficit at that
time was £1,059.432. Here, then, is a rule-of-three
sum. If the deficit was £1,059,432 at December 31
in one year, and that financial year ended with a
deficit of £1,167,017, what will the final deficit be
in a year when it was £664,213 on December 31?
You can make it £730,000 and keep the change. That
is how the deficit for the current year is shaping.
Yet The Bulletin sees frequent remarks in the
newspapers, inspired by the Treasury, that Mr. Cann
is “sitting down hard.” Even if Mr. Cann knew
how to sit down hard he wouldn’t he allowed to.
“Who is Cann,” fellow-Ministers ask, “that he should
govern his equals?” The sooner Holman gets to the
Treasury the better. He at least will be entitled to
say “No!”
But though the N.S.W. outgoings for the past six
months have been nominally onlv £430,336 more
than for the corresponding half of 1912, while the
revenue was £825 555 more, there are one or two
things to be said. Of the outgoings in 1912,
£211,890 was paid as sinking fund to wipe out old
debt. Nothing whatever has gone that way in the
past half-year. Also, £140.887 less has been paid
in local government subsidies—which means in most
cases that the assistance has been merely deferred.
Also, very little has been paid for maintenance and
repair of public buildings, etc. Deduct those
amounts from the improvement shown by the past
half-vear and there isn’t anv improvement left that’s
worth talking about. In other words, at the end of
the first half there is practically no improvement
on the position which was shown at the end of the
first half of the previous year ; and that year ended
with a deficit of £1,167,017. That, plainly, is the
size of the financial situation which will face Hol-
man when he steps into the Treasury.
Australian foreign-trade returns for 11
months to the end of November: —
Imports (merchandise) . . £70,296.039
Exports (merchandise) . . 64,577,180
Excess of imports . . £5,718,859
This means that in the 11 months Australia lived
beyond its means to the extent of £5,718,859 plus
the total amount of interest on its public and private
loans and the dividends on Australian, shares held in
England. The interest on the public loans for the
11 months was approximately £8,635,000, and the
proportion directly payable to John Bull was
£6,565,000. Exclusive, therefore, of the interest
and dividends on private loans and investments (in-
cluding the very big dividends in Kalgoorlie, Broken
Hill and Cloncurry mining cos.), Australia lived
beyond its means to the extent of (say) £12,250,000
during the 11 months. And then some people say
there really isn't a boom, and that the signs of pros-
perity which they see around them are due to good
seasons and high prices !

This pastoral and pastoral-finance co. celebrates its
50th year by giving its already well-fed shareholders
an extra £13,000 in the shape of a 21 p.c. special
bonus. (Of its usual 121 p.c. div. it calls 2i p.c. a
bonus.) Still, profits are less than they have been
sometimes, though the dazzling £189,349 in 1911
was quite exceptional, and was largely due to the
sale of station properties at prices in excess of book
values. These sales followed on the progressive land
tax, which this and other cos. were so alarmed about.
As a matter of fact the price got for land suitanle
for close settlement has nearly always been far in
excess of the book value —which was the sheep
value. This is very good proof that the land wasn’t
being put to its best use. Further, although a big
co. would have to pay a pretty stiff tax if it held
its big estates, it was able to pass the land on to
people who mostly escaped the tax, the smaller hold-
ings being usually worth less than £5000; conse-
quently the co., though it talked a lot about the
, depreciation of the capital value on account of the
tax, was able to sell the land as though it carried
no tax at all. In other words, if they sold, the big
landlords suffered nothing at all from the tax. Cer-
tainly this co. had to move on and find other empty
spaces, and it preferred its chance of getting them
or some of them in Argentina rather than rely
wholly on the remoter places of Australia. It has
therefore established an office in Buenos Ayres, and
two or three thousand pounds spent in organising the
business there have been charged up with the past
year s working exes.
The amounts shown for the past two years as
written off have mostly gone in writing down the
reserve-fund investments—gilt-edged tnings like
British Consols, which it was thought would give
tone to any reserve fund. Quite a lot of directors
have rearranged their views about the virtue of
British investments for nest-egg purposes. There
was a time when some Australian Boards thought
that the last word was said when they had reported
that their shareholders’ reserves were in Consols.
Since then much good, hard Australian profit has
had to go towards providing for the dreadful shrink-
age that has taken place.
Like a good many old hands at the game of
pastoral finance, this co, doesn’t rely much on the
casual deposit, but raises most of the money it
needs, in addition to its own capital, by debenture
stock. Its share capital is if 520,000 ; its debenture
stock (nearly all 4 p.c.), £2,000,000, less £86,660
which it has repurchased. All other liabilities total
£388,075, including trade accounts and customers’
credit balances. In cash and investments (chiefly
the British stocks before-mentioned) the co. has
£616,089 ; and the balance of its assets consist of
properties and advances on properties, stock and
other securities ( £2,257,183) and premises, advances
on wool, customers’ debit balances and sundries
( £525,054). Going in largely for pastoral property-
owning itself, its profits are erratic, because in the
nature of things the man who runs sheep and cattle
must go into country which the agriculturist wants
least, because its rainfall is least dependable. But it
is a business in which there are wonderful ups as
well as distressing downs ; and for the man who can
hang on long enough, and who knows the business
and doesn’t cripple his country by over-stock-
ing, the profits are far greater" than the losses.
The man or the co. that makes a mess of things is
the man or the co. that either doesn’t know the busi-
ness, or has to realise when a drought has driven
values temporarily down towards zero. And the one
who has to do that is nearly always the one who has
borrowed money which is liable to be called up at
very short notice. Hence the wisdom of this co. in
financing itself on debenture stock.

The co. started fairly well, as most amusement cos.
do. ; but when the first ice-skating craze died, it was
in trouble. The directors then turned their atten-
tion from Society to mutton, and are apparently find-
ing much more profit in it. Also, they went in for
the ice-supply business. So the co. has three strings
to its bow now—(1) cold-storage accommodation ;
(2) ice-supply; (3) the Glaciarium, wherein, in the
season, the young thing just back from England may
tell her Johnnie-boy of the ripping time she had on
the ice “at Home,” and thus establish herself among
the Elect. When the capital put up in exchange
for shares proved insufficient to carry out the altered
programme, first £5OOO was raised on pref. shares
and then a small mortgage already existing was in-
creased to £12,500, at which it now stands. Since
the first year the only people who have got any in-
terest on their capital are these pref. shareholders
and the mortgagees. Nevertheless last year’s profit,
after paying interest and pref. dividend and writing
£llOl off for depreciation, was sufficient to show 5
p.c. on the ordinary capital of £24,500. True, there
is some doubt whether £llOl was enough to write
off plant, etc., to cover depreciation, which in this
industry is notoriously heavy ; and if it isn’t enough
the 5 p.c. on ordinary capital wasn’t earned. How-
ever, even allowing for that, the position and outlook
are not hopeless, by any means. Ice-skating, though
it is too expensive to become a popular craze, will
always command a certain amount of support—pro-
bably enough to earn its own exes, and a bit over,
as a rule—while the demand for cold storage and for
ice is likely to go on increasing. The co. owns its
freehold, so if it pays interest it at least is free
from the monthly call of the landlord. Also, it will
never have to pay anything extra for its quarters
even when Melbourne has grown to twice the present
size, and the country grows twice as many lambs,
and this co. has twice the present chances of making
money.

As far as can be ascertained, the plant, etc., are not
written down, the only provision for wear and tear
being made through the Depreciation Fund. If so,
the true reserves are considerably less than £74,122 ;
also, of course, the true profit for the past half-year
is less than £11,369. If in the production of the
half-year’s revenue, plant, etc., have deteriorated to
the extent of the amount which has been added to
the Depreciation Fund, then the half-year’s profit
was £7518, which was only £lOlB in excess of the
dividend ; and, remembering that something like a
construction boom has still been in progress during
the six months, and that prices for timber have been
quite exceptional, this is by no means a comfortable
margin. Certainly the profit is still a great deal
more than it was a few years ago ; but against that
has to be put the fact that the capital, which was
only £77,500 to start with, is now £130,000. More-
over, the co.’s liabilities are again pretty heavy.
This shows how matters have moved in that respect:

Ihe co. doesn’t seem able to keep the figures down in
spite of the frequent calls for new capital. 'this
seems to be due mainly to the accumulation of
stocks: in two years they have increased from
f 61.510 to £101,435, while advances on logs and
stock in transit have gone along from £23,617 to
£ 04,598. An accumulation of £70,000 of extra
stock in two years seems much for a co. with a
capital of £130,000. Possibly further increased
costs are threatening the ' timber-millers—the
men in the toilsome business certainly are not
satisfied with the money they used to make a few years
ago. But whether prices for logs will go still higher
and stay up there is a matter of opinion. One thing
seems certain—-the retail prices which have ruled
for timber during the last year or two will not be
maintained when the construction rush is over. The
N. S. Wales Government alone spent £7,000,000 or
so of borrowed money last year, and, though it has
•just had another loan of £8,000,000 underwritten
in London, it has had to pay such a price as it has
never had to pay since the hoom and the burst of
25 years ago. Nothing is surer than that the recent
rate of borrowing can’t continue; and nothing is
surer, either, than that the people who have gained
most, directly and indirectly, by the boom while it
has lasted are the timber-merchants and other sup-
pliers of construction materials.

Profit is shown “after making full allowance for
everything in the nature of bad and doubtful debts
and the usual appropriation for depreciation.” What
the “usual appropriation” is we don’t know. And,
of course, the visible profits may be made large or
small by the very simple process of making the
“usual appropriation” small or large. It is a case
in which the investor has to take a great deal on
trust, not merely in regard to this matter of wear
and tear and depreciation generally, but in regard
to stocks and other things. Stocks, the directors
say, are “valued under cost”—which is an elastic
remark. It may mean that, in addition to accumu-
lating visible reserves, the directors have put them-
selves as safe as they know how by writing down
assets below their true value, and thus creating in-
ternal reserves. The Bulletin certainly wouldn’t
blame them for doing that sort of thing. The timber
man, and especially the timber-man who deals so
largely in big sticks, and does so much business with
Governments and other public bodies, has been having
such an innings lately as he can hope to have only
twice or thrice in a lifetime. Hence the prudent
timber co.’s management will undoubtedly, if it
wants to save itself trouble in the future, drop a
little of the fruits of the present abnormal harvest
into a stocking, to draw upon when conditions
change.
But even if the Allen Taylor people are really
doing no better than they show, they are doing pretty
well, the lay-by after paying the 10 p.c. div. being
£3302 for the year. Moreover, debts are very
moderate, wherefore a slump wouldn’t find the co.
loaded with interest on liabilities incurred against
heavy, dull stocks. This shows the movement of the
figures in that and other respects:—•

The “cash, etc.,” item above is exclusive of £20,300.
to the credit of the Insurance and Reserve Fund;
this is invested apart from the business, mostly in
bank deposits and public securities. The co.’s liquid
assets therefore exceed the liabilities. Nevertheless
“in pursuance of the gradual process of development
foreshadowed in previous reports,” 25,000 new shares
(one to five) are to be issued at par—a nice little
bonus, seeing that the co. may, on its figures, reason-
ably be expected to pay 10 p.c. on the increased capi-
tal. Altogether, the accounts and the report make a
good impression. True, the hand of R. McC. Ander-
son, one of the managing directors, can be traced in
the report, and one wouldn’t expect R. McO. Anderson
to put things badly if they could be put attractively;
still, allowing for all that, there is the fact that
the div. is apparently being very com fortably earned,
while the co. has so few liabilities that their total is
exceeded by the liquid assets, without even reckoning
book debts as liquid assets.

Once a year, generally on New Year’s
Day, we get an extra-choice bit of nonsense in the
daily papers —a return showing the new cos. regis-
tered during the year, along with their capital. So
far as N. S. Wales is concerned, this is how the
figures have run for the past six years:—
Companies. Capital.

1913 . . ■ • 429 12,125,737
Of that £12,125,737 about £550,000 was paid in
money by the public. What a wild farce the whole
business is may be judged by the figures for two
moderately new cos. whose accounts have lately been
dissected in the Wild Cat Column. The nominal
capital of those two concerns is £1,000,000, and
for that amount they figure in the Registrar’s return.
The net capital actually subscribed was under
£30,000. The majority of the new cos. registered
asked for no capital from the public at all: it was
merely a case of private firms being turned into
limited cos. without the issue of any new capital.
The inflation of the figures shows one thing clearly
the unhealthy condition which has been produced
by the Government’s borrow-and-boom policy.
“Y. and A.” : Australian Stock Exchange
mining business all through 1913 has not been large
or profitable. There has been no big new field found ;
no distinctly new processes have been started on old
fields; no Bullfinch boom has helped the weary
broker. The truth is there are too many brokers
on every Australian Stock Exchange. In Melbourne
there are 129 seats, in Brisbane 28, in Sydney 66,
in Adelaide 72, in Hobart 11, and Launceston 25.
In every instance these figures are twice what they
should be. Half the number of brokers in each city
could do the work and earn a living. Why, even the
Paris Exchange has fewer members than that of
Melbourne —the number there is limited to 80.
The Stock Exchange of Melbourne Co.,
which owns the Stock Exchange building and Safe
Deposit, made a poor net profit for 12 months of
£556. The ground and building cost £271,877
during the land boom, and the property appears in
the books at £68,614 —which is about its market
value to-day. The capital paid up is £108,055;
loan on mortgage, £82,500 ; loan from Stock Ex-
change, £17,000. So the total of capital and lia-
bilities is £207,555, now represented by the build-
ing valued at £68,614.
The New York Life office in Australia has
been told by cable that the co.’s new business in
1918 exceeded £47,672,000, which is the limit
allowed under the N’York insurance law. The head
office added its congratulations on the Australian
Department’s contribution to the result.
* * * *
According to an excellent trade summary
in Sydney Telegraph, 60 leading Australian invest-
ment stocks, quoted on the Sydney market, showed
an aggregate rise of £2,335,800 during 1913. The
average rise in quotations during the j'ear was 4.6
p.c. In the two previous years there had been shrink-
ages. The market value added since 1900 to stocks
then on the list has averaged 18 p.c. Practically the
whole of this addition occurred between 1905-9
inclusive —the years when business earnings bounded
upwards as a result of good seasons, and when, as a
general thing, wages hadn’t moved up very much to
cut into those extra earnings.
“C.E.”: It may be regarded as certain
that the four motor-’bus cos. in Melbourne will be
amalgamated. They are conferring on the point.
Look at the development. The so-called Motor
Omnibus Co. has 18 ’buses, with seven ordered. The
Motor Bus Service Co. has four, with 12 ordered.
The Globe Co. has seven, and Withers and Sons four.
Thus there will soon be 52 ’buses. The rapidity
with which they have sprung up has only been
measured by the difficulty of getting them. As in
all such cases, amalgamation is forced on by hostile
parties. There is expected legislative and possible
municipal “interference.” The Tramway Co. is on
the qui vive, too. It was suspected of having a
finger already in the motor pie, but has none. In
1915 it hands over its lines to the municipalities.
Who can doubt that its directors contemplate a
plunge into motors then ? Further, there are rumors
of foreign capital coming in. And, meantime, the
municipalities—well, they apparently are waiting
till they will have to pay the usual big price to buy
somebody out.

The change in the management of Great
Cobar was apparently due to the ructions raised by a
London committee appointed at a meeting of dissatisfied
shareholders. Evidently ' shareholders _ haven’t yet
realised how bad things are, and believe that mis-
management is all to blame for their troubles. As
a matter of fact, those troubles started before even
the co. was formed. The sampling of the mine, to
begin with, gave results which the old Cobar Syndi-
cate had never been able to approach; but it was
no business either of the syndicate or of the syndi-
cate’s manager, G. H. Blakemore, to tell them that
their figures were too high. Even had the figures
been right the “watering” was outrageous; with the
figures wrong, the capitalisation was simply ridicu-
lous. Then the Australian manager, who knew the,
mine and what it was capable of doing, was got rid
of and a man who didn’t know it was put in charge ;
and an utterly unsuitable plant was provided at great
cost. The co., finding itself in the soup, might
now do the graceful thing and call in Blakemore for
a report. He, anyhow, is the one man who has run
the Great Cobar successfully.
* * * *
The first report by the directors of the
Wild Cherry, Ardlethan (N.S.W.), is not good read-
ing. The co. has a nominal capital of £150,000 in
£1 shares, and £105,000 is paid up. “Ore in
sight”— i.e., measured up on three sides —is 30,600
tons of an assay value of £55,400, and there is ore
at grass valued at £5265. The co. has a million
gallons of water in its three-million gallon tank, and
hopes to mine and mill for 12s. a ton, which would
give a net return of £37,000 —if all the assay value
is recovered. Recovery percentage will, however, be
an unknown quantity until after a month or two
of practice. A mill is to go up at once to treat 300
tons a week, and “Mr. E. P. Johnson, consulting
engineer to the c 0.,” believes that “even 1 p.c. ore
would leave a considerable margin of profit to the
c 0.,” which statement is merely hot air. Certainly
the estimates of ore in sight include 500 tons worth
10 p.c. and 4300 tons worth 3 p.c. ; but the balance
of the estimate is inade up of 25,800 tons of 0.5 p.c.
Of the ore at grass 212 tons represent £3124; 475
tons represent £1714 ; and the balance of 835 tons,
worth £427, was not worth mining. Of the £15,000
placed to working capital, the co. has spent £2608
on mine development, £B3l on office, legal and
accountancy charges, and £1791 on “plant, machin-
ery and water supply.” “Preliminary expenses” were
£3367, in additionto the purchase price of the pro-
perty, i.e., £90,000. The co. has £6400 on hand
in cash, fixed deposits, loans at call and stores. The
position of the show at flotation may be figured from
the fact that six months after purchase for £30,000
cash and £60,000 in shares, there is a possible profit
of (say) £30,000. The name of William Soutar on
the Board is an earnest of fair dealing; but at
latest it looks not improbable that somebody else
will be engineered .on to the directorate.

regrinding 20,427 tons of dump tailings, was some-
thing unusual for a four-weeks’ run. The output of
domestic lead rose to 3367 tons in November, followed
by 4822 tons in the next four weeks to December 17.

New Burragorang, Yerranderie (N.S.W.),
before closing down for the holidays, despatched 10
tons of ore to the smelter. They are stoping on a
6in. vein over No. 5 level; and that is the sort of
proposition Burragorang is. Next door the Yerran-
derie is down 1410 ft. The lode is a true fissure, but
mostly it is little more than a streak. Altogether
the district, from 1900 to 1912, produced 53,667 tons
of ore, containing 5,380,7990 z. silver, 99510 z. gold,
and 12,032 tons of lead. The feature is the high
average—over lOOoz. per ton —for silver. In 1912
the output was 7055 tons of ore, valued at*
£126,859, or an average of over £l7 per tom There
is nothing exceptional in small shipments averaging
£2O per ton ; in fact, the Colon Peaks ore averaged
£25 for 2016 tons.

Great Fingall (W.A.) is nibbling at the
Big Bell leases, which the Great Boulder refused to
swallow. The show may not suit the Boulder, and
yet be worth something to the Fingall. For instance,
the former would, in the event of purchase, have to
lay out a big sum on plant and equipment, whereas
the Fingall could put down a tram-line and rail the
ore a distance of 20 miles or thereabouts to its own
mill. The Bulletin hears, however, that the
Boulder sampling showed the value of the property
to have been much over-rated locally.

A great mistake, when erecting new works or re-
arranging old ones, is often made in constructing the
building and installing machinery ere looking round

few of the many transport systems and plants which
they have supplied, and which show the solution of
the transport question and the advantages of em-
ploying such appliances. W. and J. Lempriere,

South Kalgurli (W.A.) is still looking
for wealth in the Hainault lease, but so far without
success. When the South Kalgurli took it over the
show was almost as bare of ore reserves as old-
woman Hubbard’s cupboard was of bones, and a
good deal of money will have to be sunk in develop-
ment before any substantial return in the shape of
mill supplies can be looked for. In any case the
property has long since passed its prime, and is
never likely to yield much profit to its present
owners.
* * * *
In 1913 Great Boulder’s income in excess
of mining, treatment, development, capital and other
Australian charges was approximately £300,000, or
a few thousands less than in 1912. To date the mine
has produced about £50,000 short of nine millions
sterling, and has paid nearly 44 millions in divi-
dends. With the passing of its main ore shoot into
the Horseshoe, its days as a big gold producer are,
however, numbered.
News from the front indicates that all is
not well with the Associated Northern Co.’s Vic-
torious leases at Ora Banda. Values are alleged to
be patchy, extensions short, and extraction trouble-
some. The show is capably handled, but the best
management that ever breathed can’t put gold into
ore, and there are still some refractory conditions
which baffle scientific treatment.
Whim Well (W.A.) held its annual meet-
ing in London on November 27, when the total ship-
ments for the year were given as 7850 tons, of a
gross value of £80,708, and the ore at grass as
60,600 tons, worth 44 p.c. There were also said to
be 100,000 tons of developed 5 p.c. ore in the
mine, while the probable ore of the same grade
above water level was estimated at 10 times that
quantity] The net profit for the period under review
was £20,175, which, added to the previous year’s
balance of £9714 (after providing a 5 p.c. div. paid
in July last, and the manager’s commission), gave
a total of £29,889 to deal with. Of this amount
£9761 has been written off, leaving £20,127 to be
carried forward. The heavy drain on the co.’s cash
resources incidental to the completion of the Murex
and other plant is now declared to be at an end,
and increased divs. are promised. Frank Powell has
just had a look at the property on behalf of some
London and Paris stockholders.
Bones of the chairman’s statement at the
Whim Well meetings: Ore accumulations on
surface now total 60,000 tons, of a gross value of
£200,000. .. .The net profit that will be derived
from this is estimated at £BB,OOO. . . .The ore imme-
diately available in the mine is computed at not less
than 100,000 tons, and this, with the 60,000 tons at
grass, should provide about three years’ mill supply.
.... Handsome profits are expected from the treat-
ment of this stuff.... Co. now has a splendid pro-
perty fully equipped, and with millions of tons of
ore awaiting development. As regards the financial
position, owing to increased cost of labor, delays in
getting plant to work, etc., the original estimate for
the cost of concentration plant had been considerably
exceeded. Consequent on these delays, further large
tonnages augmented the smelter piles, meaning a fur-
ther lock-up of the co.’s capital. Now all is clear
ahead.
* * * *
Dividends still keep beyond the reach of
Menzies Consolidated (W.A.). So far about
150,0000 z, (fine) have been dug out of this mine,
and of this total ll,ooooz. were unearthed last
year. The revenue account for that period, with
£79 brought forward, shows a credit balance of
£4093 ; but with £2540 written off for machinery,
equipment, shaft-sinking, etc., only £B6 is left
to carry forward. The co. hopes to distribute profits
some day. It is much the safest to leave it indefinite
like that,
Oroya Links (W.A.) took £39,868 out of
its Kalgoorlie properties for the quarter ended Sep-
tember, and laid out £34,870, inclusive of what
was spent on plant and development. Royalties
derived from tributors totalled £349. A good deal
of time and energy was given to making the
Croesus Prop, shaft on the Eclipse leases the main
hauling way. This work is now completed and will,
it is claimed, greatly facilitate operations and reduce
costs.
* * * *
Burbanks Main Lode (W.A.) announces
a profit of £5466 for the past financial year. De-
duct £lB7B absorbed by a 5 p.c. div. paid in May
last, and a balance of £3588 is left. This sum
has been carried forward. Undivided profits now
total £15,964, but all of this has been consumed
by mine re-equipment and development. As a
result scrip holders have to do without the usual
end-of-the-vear div. The existence in the two bottom
levels of shoots of gold assaying up to 20dwt. and
25dwt. per ton, and the fact that the mine is now
equipned with up-to-date plant, gives, according to
the Board, “reassuring prospects of an early re-
sumption of returns to shareholders.”
* * * *
Lancefield (W.A.), with its miles and
miles of workings, unsatisfactory plant and dismal
record, has become the nropertv of the Kalgoorlie and
Boulder Firewood Co. Jack Dunstan, one-time metal-
lurgist at the Associated, and more recently super-
intendent of State batteries, has been appointed
manager, and word is being passed round that he will
have things in full swing again inside six months.
The co. starts with hundreds of thousands of tons of
ore in sight; and if the mine can’t be made to pav
with this stand-by, it is a greater delusion than its
worst enemy ever reckoned it to be.
From Boulder Perseverance’s latest quar-
terly report: “Exploring the older workings of the
mine has disclosed good grade ore with every pros-
pect of benefiting the reserves. Notably is this the
case between the 700 ft. and 900 ft. levels on the F
lode, 700 ft. level Perseverance lode and the 200 ft.
and 500 ft. levels El Ora lode. The low grade of the
ore crushed during the period under review is due to
the fact that but a small tonnage has been available
from the richer stopes. Ore reserves remain practi-
cally unaltered.” From ore treatment £66,615 was
derived during the quarter, but working exes., with
£7053 spent on development, swallowed up £62,850
of this.
* * * *
Ziegler’s, at Kalgoorlie (W.A L is re-
ported to have some ore in sight above 150 ft., and is
being provided with a Huntingdon mill to chew it up.
The show is leased by the little Adelaide Enterprise
Syndicate, and is perched on the side of Mount Char-
lotte, about a quarter of a mile north of Hannan’s
original find. An expert recently sent from Adelaide
to size things up reckoned that there were dividends
in the ground.
Bullrush’s paralysing circular announcing
a drop from 365. to 295. in the manager’s estimated
value of the ore reserves, coupled with the conse-
quent refusal of Gold Industry, Ltd., to carry out its
agreement to guarantee calls, has knocked the co.
clean off its financial perch. Several thousand pounds
are said to be needed to give the mine a fair chance
to show its real capacity, and although strenuous
efforts are being made to get temporary accommoda-
tion from a certain mining crowd, negotiations look
like ending in failure. Meantime work is at a stand-
still, and some difficulty is likely to be experienced
in getting in calls.
* * * *
Princess Royal (W.A.) now provides
means of subsistence for a tribute party or two, and
furnishes an occasional div. in the shape of royalty
and battery pickings to the co. A shareholders’ roll-
up was held in Adelaide the other day, when the
amount in credit was £467, made up of cleanings of
battery plates, sale of concentrates and royalties.
Two Northern tin shows are gaining favor
in Melbourne, where dealers have given Lode Hill
shares a run on the strength of borehole tests and
favorable reports. This property gave no fortune to
the hard-working party which stuck to it for years,
but if tests go for anything, there is enough tin
about to give the co. a good start. The water-
supply has been greatly improved, and the decom-
posed granite, of which the hill mostly consists, will
in future be handled to better advantage. If there is
a fly in the co.’s ointment it is that there are
hard spots in the granite, and the tin contents vary
considerably. The Annan River Co. has placed its
preference shares (24,000 at 20s. each), and pump-
ing machinery is being installed to get a supply of
water from a dam under construction. This hitherto
struggling concern is expected to treat 30,000 cub.
yards per month. When the Annan tin field was dis-
covered tin oxide was selling at about £56 per ton.
Favored with double that price, sluicing of large
faces of low-grade dirt should be profitable.
Chillagoe looks in for its third sixpenny
call, making shares paid up to 9s. 6d. There are
1,200,000 shares with 'a nominal value of 10s. per
share. Ore that averages from £4to£ 5 in value would
under ordinary circumstances give handsome profits ; but
in this case the supply isn’t regular or abundant, and
it is drawn from too many small mines to allow
of low costs. Mount Mulligan coal may help a little;
but the real anxiety is to find a good metal mine.
St. Mungo, in the Cloncurry district (Q.),
has had a dry half-year. While the copper market
was good the little co. gouged out its rich ore
merrily. Then came the day when development had
to be looked to, and profits disappeared. Only
£llOO worth of ore was raised during the six
months, and the exes, were £1676, including £64
for depreciation of plant. The outlook is, however,
still cheerful, and with half a dozen faces of the
rich but bunchy ore from which the mine has
hitherto made its money, dividends ought to come
back again within the next few months. The
financial position is still quite good: liquid assets
exceed the liabilities by about £l5OO.
Manager Corbould’s summing-up to the
directors of Mount Elliott (Q.), after going through
the concentrating mill: “Your position to-day is:
You have a certain tonnage in Elliott and Consols
mines of high-grade ore in sight, from which hand-
some profits can be won ; also you have a tonnage of
probable ore which will, I think, later on be ore in
sight. But a time arrives in the life of a property
when, the points of attack being less owing to the
narrowing down of faces, it becomes impossible to
win the necessary tonnage to keep the treatment
plant in full operation, with the result that costs
become high and profits fall away. Below the No. 4 level
in Elliott, the high-grade ore, in small patches, lives
down; but the facts at present are that the high-
grade ore is small and scattered over too wide a
channel to pay. The Consols has the making of a
good mine; but so far developments do not warrant
classing it as a property from which a large tonnage
per day can be relied upon to keep a treatment plant
going on its own ; and the ore, being high in sulphur,
should be reserved for blending. Some of our pro-
specting ventures give promise of becoming mines of
medium-grade ore; but before a copper proposition
on this [Cloncurry] field is of any value as a profit-
earner it must be coupled up by rail in order to
handle the necessary tonnage economically. The
high-grade ores are excellent profit-producers so long
as they continue; but the medium and lower-grade
ores are the mainstay in giving long life. Viewing
the copper mines of the world, the grade of the ore
gets poorer with depth. There are exceptional mines,
but few ; and it is not to be expected that Cloncurry
is going to be an exception. The permanency of a
mining co. is in the medium and, later, the lower-
grade ores ; and before the high-grade ores give place
to the low it becomes a matter of looking ahead and
increasing the tonnage, altering and enlarging the
treatment plant to cope with the new conditions, and
making a smaller profit per ton over a larger tonnage
treated. It is most advisable to further secure or
absorb certain properties to supply a central treat-
ment plant with a large tonnage of medium-grade
ore; and I am convinced that no mining field in
Australia offers a better proposition for investment
than Cloncurry, on the line of linking up a group
of properties by rail and erecting a central treatment
plant to treat a large tonnage of medium-grade ore.”
Brilliant Extended; Charters Towers, has
declared a sixpenny, payable this month. A good
average return has been forthcoming, in spite of the
hot weather, which makes ventilation difficult. The
Deeps comes second to the Extended in point of
stone crushed: for 11 months, Extended, 23,960
tons, £54,030; Deeps, 7856 tons, £33,388. The
Deeps continues to sink under difficulties, for the
flow of water is heavy and the ventilation imperfect.
A big improvement in the latter respect will arrive
when the Blocks shaft meets No. 4 level; it is
close there now.
* * * *
New Brilliant Freehold, Charters Towers,
is letting the battery talk. The last lot put through
was 646 tons for £2136, somewhat poorer than the
previous 612 tons for £2383. The local market is
slack, because the bottom level (No. 6) is showing
too much white stone.
The Papuan Brilliant and Victoria,
Charters Towers, has connected its workings with the
old Havelock Moonstone shaft, and improved ventilation
has followed. The co. will continue to raise stone from
the footwall and hanging wall sections of the Moonstone,
and will also be able to prove the value of the cross
reef. This mine gave £12.408 from 1793 tons last
year, an average of over £6 19s. per ton. But the
bottom level is the poorest and reserves are light,
so, in spite of its flash of prosperity, the Papuan
is small goods in the market.
At the Hampden-Cloncurry meeting a
while back the chairman’s account of development
work was cheerful, as every chairman’s speech is ex-
pected to be. The deepest mine is the Duchess, whose
next level will be at 700 ft. To expedite prospecting
two winzes have been sunk from the 550 ft. level.
They met with rather long blanks from 70ft. to 89ft.
and from 62ft. to 87ft. respectively. These two
winzes are 140 ft. apart, and the one furthest north
is 365 ft. from the shaft. How much of the 365 ft. is
blank and how much is payable cannot be told until
the 700 ft. level is through. At the Hampden there
have been a few much-rieeded developments of pay
ore ; but it is very difficult to size up the value of a
streaky show of this kind.

“A.5.1t.0.”: An assay plan of the Great
1 itzroy’s Laloki (Papuan) option shows that, in the
bottom east drive, the stuff averaged 33.6 dwt. gold,
3.8 p.c. copper, 3.320 z. silver, 2.1 p.c. silica, 47 p.c.
iron (and iron oxide), and 37 p.c. sulphur for the
distance from 100 ft. to 125 ft., and 53.2dwt. gold,
3.4 p.c. copper, 4.640 z. silver, 39 p.c. iron, and 35.7
p.c. sulphur for the next 25ft. Silica contents were
from 1.9 to 2.1 p.c. The gold average for the 50ft.
was 43dwt.
“M.C.”: The Laloki (Papua) will prob-
ably be much gambled over this year. Great Fitzroy
has clinched the bargain, and will probably issue a
report about the big basic ore body, described as
being very similar to the one worked in Mount Lyell’s
famous open cut. It is worth noticing, however, that
Mount Lyell’s pyritic ore is now down to about
s p.c., and another pyritic mine—Many Peaks (Q.)
—has also fallen off in copper values. Laloki’s pre-
sent values are no doubt due to local enrichment. At
Mount Lyell approximately 100 tons of pyritic fluxes
are used to smelt 56 tons of silicious ore. The pro-
blem at Laloki is how to get the silica.
Mount Lyell reports 533 tons of blister
from 25,396 tons of ore, a fair return considering
that the four-weeks’ run ended on Christmas Eve
and the smelter had to make sure of a supply of ore
through the holidays. That meant running with
only two furnaces for eight days to conserve the
supply. For 12 weeks (October 2 to December 24)
78,783 tons smelted have given 1646 tons copper,
showing an average of 2.08 p.c. Taking electrolytic
copper at £7O, the average extraction works out at
295. per ton for copper and from ss. 6d. to 6s. for
gold and silver, or together (say) 355. per ton of ore.
Costs to produce fine metal don’t average more than
255. per ton of ore, and with cheaper electric power
there will be a chance of clipping something off that.
Increased smelting to the full capacity of 400,000
tons a year, producing 8000 tons of copper, would
also pull down costs. Averaging the extraction at
2 units of pure copper (a 50 to 1 ratio) a cut of 2s.
per ton means saving from £30,000 to £40,000 in
12 months.
North Mount Farrell is one of the little
Tasmania West Coast mines that plug away, and
occasionally give shareholders a taste. In October, it
paid a sixpenny div., and another (the 12th) will be
available this month. The profit for six months to
the end of October was £5488; depreciation ate
£lO2B of that, and the balance was available for
dividends and for that stand-by fund which the co.
has never neglected when things have been at all
prosperous.

Williams Fancy, the Berringa (Vic.)
mine whose people know how to keep exes, down,
did better than usual for its shareholders last half.
Out of 6fdwt. stone, which brought in £18,279, a
mine profit of £8691 was made. In divs. £6600
was paid during the half and another £l2OO was
made available to pay shareholders’ New Year’s Day
exes. Mine and mill costs were together 11s. per
ton, 2s. lOd. per ton was put into development, and
management, contingencies and all other extras ran
to under Bd. The good prospects which make Sam
Stretch and his company joyful are beyond the big
break south at the bottom (No. 7) level, where
there is about 4 ft. of stone worth from 6dwt. to
Bdwt. ; and most of the ground above this point—-
south, that is, of the big break : —is virgin. Manager
Langsford is to tickle this part of the mine during
the half-year, and if it gives the same answer as
the No. 7 has done, shareholders won’t know them-
selves.

Though the actual consumption of tin is
really not increasing very fast, the payable tin-
bearing areas of the earth are so limited that the
world’s output has all it can do to keep up to the
demand. In fact, if tin statistics are to be believed,
the demand has actually been ahead of the supply
during the last few years, with the result that visible
stocks have shrunk as follows: —
1909 . . . . 20,918 tons
1910 .. .. 17,194 „
1911 .. .. 16,514 „
1912 . . . . 10,997 „
And it is still more remarkable that this shrinkage
of stocks has occurred during a boom in the tin
market, which one would expect to result in a largely
increased production on the one hand and a gradually
restricted consumption on the other.
Dr. Wade, the English petroleum expert
imported by the Commonwealth Government, is at
present examining the bore at Vailala, 160 miles
N.E. of Port Moresby. He will then prepare a geo-
logical map of the district and report generally
about the petroleum industry in Papua. Meantime
he has suggested Port Romilly, about 40 miles west
of Vailala, as a suitable harbor for oil vessels instead
of Yule Island, which is 96 miles SE. The oil area
is estimated to cover 900 square miles. The stuff
so far obtained is a light oil of a paraffin base, and
it is so scant in quantity and poor in quality as to
suggest that the true reservoir of petroleum has not
yet been struck.
The Great Cobar slump in London has
been so bad that even the £lOO debentures got down
to £55; and.if that is a fair value for debentures,
how much less than nothing are shares worth? As
a matter of fact, with anything like decent manage-
ment, there is no visible reason at present why these
mortgage debentures should have shrunk below par.
Australian softgoods wholesale houses
suffered pretty badly from the buttoning-up of
pockets last year and the call the banks made on
their customers to reduce stocks. Here were the
profits of three representative houses: —
1911. 1912. 1913.
Robert Reid . . . . £68,550 £78,370 £48,923
P L &B. . . • . 62,848 62,738 51,173
D. &W. Murray . . 88,209 82,237 62,960
Dividends paid by these three cos. totalled £137,322
in 1911 and £116,215 in 1913 ; and nearly £50,000
less was added to reserves in the latter year.^
Recently the spirit moved a Fijian in-
vestor to ask the London Mining Magazine why a
local banana and sugar-cane buyer had been ap-
pointed ’boss of a big copper-mining concession.
The reply he got was that, while the editor was
unable to see how experience in the banana or
sugar trade qualified anybody for the management
of a copper co., it afforded at least as good a train-
ing as the command of a regiment, the possession of
a peerage, eminence in law, or unusual skill in
cricket. As he was unable to explain the relations
between bananas and copper, he returned the 4s.
sent by the investor to cover the cost of inquiry. It
is amazing how some people drop into mining billets.
The Bulletin has known and seen mines managed
by a cobbler, barber, lawyer, bank manager, school-
master, orchardist, engine-driver, dentist, brewer, and
phrenologist, and knows of instances in the West
where mines have been reported on by a blackbirder,
cooper, drummer, sewing-machine agent, barman,
clergyman, land agent, and undertaker. The last-
named furnished the most sensible and accurate
opinion of the lot.

“0.K.”: A recent epidemic of fires in Mel-
bourne oil and color warehouses will be turned to good
business account by the insurance companies, as a
matter of course. There is a combine in the insurance
trade, and the tariff for oil and color stores will no doubt
be raised. Private houses, built of brick, are practi-
cally safe from the fire-fiend, in a general way of
speaking. Millions of tenants pay fire-insurance pre-
miums all their lives, and get never a sixpence from
the companies. But if a miraculous epidemic of
brick dwelling-house conflagrations came to pass the
rates would go up. The combine treats every notable
loss of the moment as a reason for increasing profits
in the future. A great game is fire-insurancing! The
shares of one co. on which eighteenpence only' has
been paid out of pocket are quoted at 50s. And the
bloated capitalist who sells his £75 investment for
£2500, after having drawn fat dividends thereon for
two-score years, reckons that he is reaping the just
reward of Private Enterprise.
Though others may have idled during the
past few weeks in M.L., the various Coal Merchants’
Associations did not. Instead, they put on a spurt, with
the result that in the last two months they lifted
more coin out of the public pocket than in any
previous two months. In Christchurch they raised
Kaitangata coal from 38s. to 445., though the mine
did not cease work, and the product did not cost one
penny more to land in Christchurch. Retailers who
had large stocks on hand, and who refused to join in
the great organised steal, are now being boycotted
or threatened with boycott. Yet if you mentioned
preference to unionists to those organisations they’d
bare their fangs and snarl in two octaves.

A
WOMAN'S
LETTER
Sydney, January 5, 1914.
My Dear Arinx, —
Our Agricultural Show Ground palpi-
tated with tartans on New Year’s Day.
The Highland Gathering was mercifully
tempered bj r a cool breeze; but, in spite of
this dispensation of Providence, some of tae
inhabitants of heavy-weight woollen plaids
looked warm enough to sit on an ice-pack
without noticing any inclemency in the
weather. Governor Strickland was shad-
owed by A.D.C. Robins (a long, tliinnish
figure clad from head to toe in white that
made you blink, unless you had your smoked
glasses) and Help Macnaghten. The lat-
ter is a fine, strapping young man, with a
Scotchbyterian’s Sunday expression and a
stupendous forehead that fights its way out
of a small Scotch cap pertaining to the
militia. High Commissioner Reid waddled
across the ground during the afternoon, and
Dugald Thomson, little heard of in public
these times, was in the throng. The Ameri-
can boys, with their lean, tanned chief,
Piexotto, tramped on to the ground. They’re
a mixed assortment as to size ; the smallest
urchin looks young enough t > dote on candy.
The Roman chariot race was the big item
of the 1914 Highland Gathering. You’d ex-
pect it would be, of course, and recall the
good old days, when the first Roman chariot
bolted down Princes-street, Edinburgh, and
Julius Caesar fought the first kilt he met
at the border. That’s a long time ago, and
even Eittle Arthur’s History of England
forgot to mention it. Anyhow, Herminius
Cowley and Mamilius Earp drove their
ponies round the show in Roman waggons
about the size of round bath tubs, till the
spectators yelled with excitement, and the
ponies’ tails and a cloud of dust galloped
together to the winning post. Herminius
Cowley got away from his rival in the last
heat and was crowned with a Highland
Roman wreath instead of the more useful
sun-bonnet.
The American “White Sox” and “Giants”
team is not entirely composed of millionaires,
as on a hurried look at their general ap-
pearance one might suppose. There is
only one appallingly rich man, .Comisky,
in the company. He has made his pile at
baseball —began life as a baseball player,
and will continue to run baseball for all it
is worth (which is a few million dollars to
him) till he passes out. The rank and file
of the team struggles along on a wage of
£lOOO a year and all expenses paid. Why
don’t girls take up baseball instead of
crochet? Manager McGraw, they say,
draws £5OOO per annum. He doesn’t expect
to find anything better on earth to play on
than Sydney Cricket Ground, though the
Sox and Giants found it a bit fast on Satur-
day afternoon. The baseballers have char-
tered the St. Albans for their world tour,
which will cover 47,000 miles. There are
nine brides, two young children, and the
superfluous dollars already mentioned as
ballast.
R. L. Baker, better known as “Snowy,”
gave a dinner to the baseball men
on Saturday evening. The Australia’s draw-
ing-rooms were used for the purpose, and
brand-new Gaud-Mayor Richards took the
chair. “Giants” and “White Sox” purred
at the compliments their host poured over
them at the joyous meal, and then petrolled
off to the Baker Stadium.
The new Jap Consul-General for Australia
is invoiced under the name of Seizaburo
Shimizu —which has a shudder for us in its
first and last syllables. The Kumano Maru
brings this Oriental potentate to us.
When the news of the Tasman’s bad luck
in bumping up against Bramble Cay was
flashed here, most concert-goers wondered
where Nordica kept her diamonds. When
the lady is splitting the welkin with Brunn-
hilde’s battle-yell, her head usually flashes
like a lighthouse. As it turned out, the Tas-
man wasn’t going anywhere near the bottom.
But we couldn’t guess that from the first
wireless message. Hence the local chatter
over the prospective waterlogging of the Nor-
dica diamond mine.
That meek English publication, The
Gentlewoman, makes extracts from Miss
Jessie Ackermann’s book; to show 'that
the Australian husband is occasionally
Mud. “If he lives in , a town he
will keep a motor especially and
entirely for his own use, sending it to a
garage when he does not need it. He bul-
lies his pool', patient wife, who in most
cases has helped him to build his fortune,
and browbeats his ladylike daughters. A
most obnoxious habit of his is to poke about
the pantry. Taking his carriage he returns
to the grocer goods he considers unneces-
sary. He is abominably mean and close-
fisted. If a buslnnan and desiring .a holi-
dav, he takes his carriage” (observe the
carriage as the bushman’s motive power)
“and horses, and leaves them at -the little
township till his return from the city, thus
leaving his wife and daughters’’ (the sons
presumably go off with Dad in his carriage)
“without means of getting out for weeks at
a time.... How different are the English
husbands!”
So this is the Australian Benedict whom
we see at 5 p.m. every day, a beast of bur-
den, carrying in one hand a large leather
bag, and loaded to his top waistcoat button
with brown-paper parcels of fruit, cakes,
sweets and Heaven knows what other com-
missions for the wife and kiddies. This
average plain citizen husband is _ not
an angel. He may smoke a bit and drink a
bit and wipe his muddy boots inside the
hall instead of remembering the doormat.
But if he isn’t an angel it is well, for his
wife does not (as yet, of course) belong to
the Celestial Choir either. Nevertheless, he
is willing to swelter in the city for weeks
at a time while Mrs. Plain Citizen and her
brood are gathering a fine crop of freckles on
some cool hilltop.
The adoring husband in excelsis belongs as
a class to Australia and the U.S.A. He is
a queer mixture of self-effacement and doting
devotion, the husband of a local “Society”
woman. He sits in his own motor by the
kind indulgence of his wife and daughters
when they find it convenient to have him.
He pays for their amusements with prodigal
generosity, and he is the generally-useful
man who fetches and carries for the most-
spoilt woman, outside the U.S., who speaks
the English tongue.
Dr. and Mrs. R. H. Todd, after tumbling
over the face of the earth for the last six
months, at a speed that makes you giddy
when you hear the details, got safely ashore
off the Orvieto as soon as it hugged this
port. They didn’t go to Jericho, but they
did race in and out of nearly every other
well-known address you can think of. As
the versatile Todd is on the Council of the
Sydney Zoo, he hobnobbed with lions, tigers
and other notable personages in all kinds of
foreign menageries, from Nuremberg to
Cairo. Nuremberg, by the way, which is
not much past the era of the shoemaker
Hans Sachs in some of its customs, has one
of the finest and most modern Zoos in the
world. Its lions roar in leafy retreats only
separated by a fancy lake from the startled
spectators on the opposite shore. The trav-
ellers tore through Rome, Florence, Berlin,
Munich, England and France, did a
richochet to Egypt and Cyprus, and arrived
here intact. Before removing her hat, little
Mrs. Todd fixed her pince-nez firmly on her
nose, and began to look for printers’ errors
in the Woman’s Budget, which she edits
in her overtime.
Astronomer Evershed and his wife (she’s
a sister of Mrs. R. H. Todd) had time to
rest the soles of their feet in this port after
leaving the Orvieto en route for Maoriland.
The learned Evershed is from the Kodai
Ivanal Observatory in Southern India. The
Dominion wants his advice as to the best
site —at little Nelson or elsewhere —for its
proposed solar observatory. The star ex-
pert is a tall, thin man with a scholarly
droop of the shoulders, and he’d hand you a
chair in the usual absent-minded astronomi-
cal way as if he were reaching for a star
or feeling for a sun spot.
Josephine Cohan, now playing in “Officer
666,” says that Uncle Sam’s States are still
mad about ragtime. She met it over there
last year in her rush to N’York, and was
staggered to see her young son lead his
grandmother forward to dance ragtime under
the domestic roof. “Everybody’s doing it,
that’s how it is! It’s in the air, and you’re
catching it here, too! Also I noticed the
N’York girls had developed the ‘ ingenue
slump’ while I was standing up straight in
Australia. Of course, I didn’t know it was
the ‘ ingenue slump’ when I saw it last
summer —I just wondered what was the
matter with them all, and what kind of
gone-to-pieces epidemic was raging in the
town. Everybody’s doing it! So I tried it,
and brought it back to Australia in October.
Then my husband took notice. ‘You mustn’t
stand like that—why don’t you straighten
up?’ ‘Straighten up!’ (You can guess I felt
hurt.) Why, I’ve been practising the slump
all summer and —I suppose the floppy style
is getting hold of your girls too. It’s like
ragtime—everybody’s doing it.” When
Josephine, as the Heiress in “Officer 666,”
puts that brainy head of hers into a brown
velvet hat like a rolled pancake, and appears
in a jacket to match, with a skirt the color
of a flush rose in a dead faint, she is so
“cute” that you can’t remember whether
she has an ingenue slump or a spine like a
straight steel rod.
“Aladdin,” at the Adelphi, is filling the
big, cool theatre. Grace Palotta is now the
lad with the lamp, Carrie Moore being out
of the bill. She starts business in a saucy,
cherry-colored suit —the kind of garb Adam
may have yearned for when he first took to
trousers. They’re only a few inches short,
but an elegant leg gives every excuse for the
brevity. As far as one can judge from
handsome Palotta’s present form, she pos-
sesses the secret of eternal youth, and may
go on playing the part of Principal Boy for
the next half-century. Mabel Batchelor, the
Princess, looks about 12 years voung, and
tosses her sweet dramatic soprano round the
roof to loud applause. The music—mostly
by conductor Wynne Jones —is so good that
if it had been imported at enormous expense
I suppose we’d read more about it over the
breakfast egg. Acoustics are less good at
the Adelphi ; nevertheless, “The Trail of the
Donesome Pine” makes the rafters ring while
the Princess lets them have it from the
stage, and a quartet in the d.c. give their
harmonious support.
A citizens’ banquet to R. L. Baker, who
is rushing off to America with his wife in
the Ventura, occurs before this reaches you.
As an athlete and a man, “Snowy” is one
of this town’s most popular facts. Re his
forthcoming scamper, which will cover most
of the earth in about five months, he says:
“You’ll be surprised to hear that in Finland,
where it snows for about nine months in the
year, swimming is compulsory by law, yet
we haven’t got it here with a sunny sky and
the sea lapping our shores.” He is going
to pick up some more physical-culture cargo
in Finland (which he saw last in 1907-8),
and in Sweden and Denmark, and he will
even have a look at the biceps of Laplanders.
“I’m out for information all the time —in-
formation and champion boxers. .My wife
goes the whole tour —and it is going to be
pretty rapid—with me. She can type and
do shorthand, and insists on acting as my
secretary—that’s her plan. Later on , I’ll
ask her gently what salary she expects.”
A swell boxer, I understand, has to be
approached these days with a low salaam
and large bags of gold. R. L. Baker is out
to catch the French boxing Adonis, Car-
pentier, and the American duke of the ring,
“Packy” Macfarland. Carpentier, who is
a good-looking youngster of 21, is earning a
mere £BOO a week at the music-halls. When
he travels on boxing business he has a re-
tinue like a nabob, including a manager, a
valet, two trainers and a secretary. He
is supposed to be the best-dressed man prac-
tising the art of giving black eyes. Mac-
farland, Mr. Baker assures me, never moves
off his native sod without his mother, two
sisters, a trainer, and a few other necessary
comforts. As the manager who engages
either of these czars has to pay all the
travelling expenses of the friends, relatives
and vassals he is out for an expensive time.
Mrs. and Miss Clark, of the pearling
family of New Farm, Brisbane, are bustling
up to Kosciusko as I write. Mr. and Mrs.
Woodhouse, of Barraba, are packing up for
the same address.
Ex-Minister for Education Fowlds, of
Maoriland, is putting his hairbrushes and
other baggage together for a trip to Eng-
land. He comes this way to catch his boat.
Mr. Fowlds is something of consequence in
the socks and shirts business for a crust;
but the crust is so nicely buttered that he
doesn’t fag at the trade nowadays. He is
the man who went forth to preach what he
termed the “new political evangel” when he
broke away from the Ward fold. That was
the end of him.
Mr. James Craig and his daughter, Scot-
tish tourists who have been sauntering
round this hamlet, are off to Rotorua
(M.L.) this week. They are devotees of
the rod, and mean to fill a few baskets with
rainbow trout before leaving the steamy
shores of Geyserland. The Dominion Gov-
ernment, by the way, has been overhauling
the Rainbow family in those parts. It
was getting too tame and plentiful to give
any sport. This season it is fighting the
hook instead of climbing ashore after the
bait.
Mrs. Mount has just come ashore here,
after an absence of six years on the other
side. She is the mother of singer Violet ot
that name, who went to London and made
a fuss by wearing a mask or something of
the kind at her first appearances in the
Smoke. The sweet uses of advertisement
and the mysterious title “L’lncognita” gave
the Australian a lucky start.
N.S.W. and other competitors for the
billet of organist and choir-master in St.
Andrew’s Scotchbyterian Church, Brisbane,
were beaten by a Victorian named Victor
Galway. The actual wage for this much-
coveted organ-grind is only £lOO a year.
But it’s a big advt. to begin with, and
brings the winner a snug prospect of pupils
waiting on the doormat. Then come the
perquisites. If St. Andrew’s does a brisk
business in weddings, the fees for churning
out suitable music usually fall into the
pocket of the official organist. Hence the
struggle for the Brisbane billet.
Conductor Leonard Francis, of Brisbane
Liedertafel, is holidaying in this State. He
is a golfer of some prowess, and has been
vigorously smacking the little white ball at
Leura and Kensington.
Two swiftly-disappearing motors rushed
through the Bathurst and Mudgee streets
during the recent holidays. After a blame-
less career along country roads, they slowed
down at Medlow for a rest and a fresh teed
of petrol, then set the compass for Sydney.
Inside the cars were Mr. A. E. Forster, of
the bedstead manufacturing firm; young
Marich, his brother-in-law; the Tillock
Bros, and Mr. Rowle-y Bull. The beginning
of this rush was punctuated by a pause at
Goulburn, where cricketer Eric Bull was
busy on the wicket. Somewhere in the
middle and hind parts of the tour the hurried
young men found time for golf. _ .There
seems to be a good deal of energy in this
country even in mid-summer, in spite ot
Foster Phraser’s fears that we are decading.
After one or two. fill-up appointments, the
M.L. Tourist Office in Sydney is now in
charge of a permanent head. W. R. Blow
fills the chair formerly occupied by
the late E. H. Montgomery, the little man
with the many friends The new official is
a son of Maoriland’s Under-Sec. for Public
Works. He has been overlooking the soap-
ing of geysers and other departmental busi-
ness in the Rotorua Tourist Office for the
last six years, and the pumice-stone, district
loaded him with appreciation and solid goods
when he left. W. R. Blow has a forceful
chin, a mild manner, and a cargo of useful
commercial habits which he picked up in
the service of the Bank of New Zealand
before he was offered a billet in the M.E.
Civil Service. As a sideline, he has been
known to sing an evening hymn in a sweet
tenor that rivalled the chirrup of the best
boy in the choir.
A Sydneysider now at Queenscliff (Vic.)
remarks that one of the sturdiest votaries of
golf in that waterside village is ex-Senator
Fraser. He is a blithe youngster of about
SO, and means to grow old some day.
Miss Grace Lawrance, one of the two
sisters in charge of the Glennie Memorial
School for Girls, Toowoomba (Q.), came
back from Europe in the Orvieto. She
has been holidaying in her native England
for nine or 10 months. The huge seminary
that was built as a memorial to the late
Anglican Archdeacon Glennie has a special
reputation for sport. If the Misses Hair-
bows of the academy have ever been beaten
at out-door games by other Bananaland
damsels they never mention it, even in a
whisper, to their school inarms.
A Bowral correspondent sends a line about
a recent “Bob hop” in that dressy neighbor-
hood. “Everyone invited gave a shilling
towards expenses.” (Bowral is a Society
retreat, so they do things extravagantly.)
“Every girl, in addition, took a contribution
to the supper. The secretary saw that
there was no overlapping, and was very firm
when too many offers to supply the sugar
rushed at her notebook. ... I had a thrilling
time getting to the hall, for roads are bad
and drivers careless, and my contributions
threatened to wobble down the front of my
dress. We began to dance at 8 p.m.....
Mrs. Bloomfield was official shepherdess of
the youthful flock, and kept awake for any
symptoms of ragtime. The first occurred early
in the evening, when a huge Sydney beauty-
man grabbed a small partner and bounded
up the hall. The girl reminded you of an
ant walking off with its supper. As Mark
Twain observed, an ant always get a
tight grip on forage twice its own 1-A 1 .:!.
Bowral is still rather early-Victonan. but
we ragged joyfully till midnight, and the
old-fashioned folks could only roll _ then-
eyes in awe-stricken silence... .The district
feels its pulse beat faster, however, for it s
full of Sydney visitors; the Macneill Simp-
sons, the Spencer Bruntpns and Dorothy
King, the Claud Readings, the Falks, and
crowds of city people are here. Hotels and
boarding-houses are bulging with prosperity,
and we’ll rag the Old Year out.”
Placards inviting the elect to a Tango
Tea, at the Tivoli, on January 6, surged
through this town last week.
Concerning the constant terror to wind and
limb caused by the motor-hog who races past
islands in the stream of street-traffic marked
“Wait here for trams,” a much-travelled
Australian tells me: “In Sydney you don t
know motoring yet—as they do in the
States.” (“Thank Heaven !” is the only suit-
able interjection just here.) “There they’ve
got ‘the speed bug.’ This insect some day
will exterminate the whole race of Murkan
millionaires, by egging them on to petrol into
Eternity. Barney Oldfield, the U.S. speed
king’—he is not a millionaire by an odd
chance —has one 120-h.p. car, but his favorite
chariot is a 240-h.p. motor. I’m told you
can’t see it as it passes. You just feel the
breeze lifting your feet off the road. That s
not a personal experience—l heard it m uNew
York. Anyhow, if a car runs you down
here, it’s because you know a
motor from a funeral in this city.”
Yours affectionately,
VANDORIAN.
“G.V.W.”: The idea of utilising prison
labor for afforestation has a little more in
favor of it than mere sentiment, the only
thing that “Tex” places to its credit in B.
11/12/T3. There are splendid plantations
scattered throughout M.L., planted wholly
or partly by prison labor, which are a valu-
able asset.' With the growth of. the trees
and the increasing demand for timber, the
value will climb faster than compound in-
terest. That the work has been done well
the age and height of the following classes
of vegetation bear witness : Douglas fir, 14
years, 35ft.; Californian redwood, 13 years,
30ft.; Eucalyptus viminalis, 13 years, 65ft.;
and Eucalyptus siberiana, 13 years, 45ft.
The allegation that prison labor is the most
expensive is so far from the truth that “Lex”
will have to take compass-bearings to hnd
his way back. At Hanmer last year the
cost of opening tree holes with contract free
labor was 19s. per 1000; with prison labor
15s per 1000. The average number em-
ployed was 15.22 prisoners per day; and
their supervision cost £l7l for the nob. E ree
labor averaged 5.35 men per day, and the
supervision cost £9O. Each prisoner s labor
for the year was valued by the head foies oi
(not a prison official) at £74. What its
value to the State will be when the trees
reach maturity it is impossible to say. And
to the individual prisoner the value of (say)
18 months or two years at forestry, as com-
pared with a similar period at boot-tinker-
ing, for instance, will be more considerable
any way one looks at it.

MELBOURNE CHATTER.
Melbourne, January 5, 1914.
My Dear Yarrie, —-
New Year’s Eve in Melbourne was an
almost doioious event. At 11.30 about 500
people were seated, limp and silent, on the
steps of the G.P.O. They all seemed to
belong to the chronically-depressed type, and
looked as though they were making good
resolutions for other people. Others made
tracks for late suburban trains, as if they
had repented of a rash resolution to wait
until midnight had struck. The only hilarity
I saw was provided by a straw-hatted youth
who danced a gutter tango with a joyful girl
his own size. They had a good hundred
yards of Flinders-street to themselves, and,
as they danced, she held his ridiculous,
narrow-brimmed headgear while he waved
her hat with the fashionable nodding rose
clamped at the back. A policeman was
eyeing them in a hostile manner when I
left.
The weather at Flemington on New Year’s
Day was beautiful enough to be cut out and
framed. Shoals of the Second Best people
attended the proceedings, but there was a
regrettable absence of the Pride of the
Market, including, of cohrse, the vice-regal
Denmans, who had gone to Perth for the
Christmas races. (In Australia, whenever
you see officialdom hurrying, it is making
for a race meeting.) The Frank Maddens,
however, put in an appearance, Mrs. Frank
in a well-seasoned costume. A Gentleman
Help of the Denman household made a
matinee hit with a full hand of girls; while
the beautiful Croker, beautifully booted (I
don’t mean that he was kicked) and gloved,
looked as if he had been gummed to his
clothes. The real sensation of the day was
the extensive X-ray performance of a lady
escorted by a gent, of the vintage of ’49 ; but
a secondary thrill was provided by a biscuit-
tinted vision sporting a pinny or smock, and
wearing a bouquet in the place that a
Highlander hangs a sporran.
Society (a tired typewriter insists on
rendering it “Sosuety”) has given the
charity fete racket a rest, and retired to the
coolth of Tasmania for the horSe-race and
warship season. Mrs. Earle, who is in the
habit of secretarying fashionable raids, is
taking a holiday with brother Dr. Pardy,
while Miss Michaelis, whose hobby it is to
assist unrecognised talent, has departed for
Wellington, accompanied by Mrs. Nott and
the severely classical Dorothea Spinney.
Robert Harper, whose electorate recently
faded off the map, slipped quietly out of
politics, after 34 years of them. But Kyne-
ton, Macedon and Gisborne rose up with an
address illustrated with photographs, and
presented it to him during an interval at the
Hanging Rock races, on New Year’s Day.
The veteran, in reply, said that it was a
mistake to cut his electorate to pieces. He
would have been earning that photograph
album still if Mernda hadn’t met the same
fate as the goat in front of the express.
The Bowes Kelly tribe met the New Year
on the wild, wet road to Tasmania. They
will be located at Norton Mandeville until
the holidays are over. The head of the
house is mourning the loss of elder brother
Hubert, who passed out in Sydney some
days since. The deceased left a large for-
tune and a widow, but no children.
The Faulkner widow, with daughter Mrs.
Mcßean, has left the Riverina station for
a while and is now browsing on the green
pastures of Menzies’. Grand-daughter
Mcßean made a dash straight at Ceylon
last month. Her companions in the charge
were Aunt Carse and Cousin Jack. The
tour has a time limit, as Frank Carse’s
marriage with lawyer Brett’s daughter is
listed for February. Only royal personages
can be absent from their own nuptials.
Queensland squatter Cobbold is now rest-
ing his fevered brow on a Western District
cow, having invested about a quarter of a
million of his savings in Yarram Park. Bob
Cain, who helps to set the fashion in socks
and ties in the most leisured circles, calls
Mr. Cobbold uncle when he is not studying
the fashions. If uncle is very nice he will
nrobably call a favorite pair of socks after
him.
Ethel, the daughter of the late Felix
Levien, who used to sleep in the Upper
House, has sprung a surprise on her friends
by publishing the belated news of her
marriage with one Guy Elwin Harvey. The
Melbourne edition of the Elwin Harvey
family is in the habit of playing the heroine
in yellowdramas.
Tristan Biisst has won the Henry Berthier
Scholarship, a Trinity College plum, and
he also grabbed the Old Melbournian prize
for literarv excellence. He is a Church of
England Grammar School boy. So Mamma
Biisst is just now the proudest woman in
Melbourne. Two elder sons of the family
got all their musical training in Australia,
and they are both doing notably well in
Germany. One is waving a baton over the
heads of an orchestra.
Gracie Neal, of Grace Park, Darling
Downs, who always descends on Melbourne
at Cup time with a tremendous stock of
clothes, is booked to marry Frank Miller,
son and heir of the Alex. Millers, of Gee-
long.
Tenor Dufault is now simply and beauti-
fully referred to as “Paul” by devoted musi-
cal girls. They linger yearningly over his
front name until it sounds like the mellow
note of a cow-bell heard at night.
Mummer Harcourt Beattie and his wife
send rather lugubrious New Year greetings.
The card is solemnly inscribed “Tempus
fugit” on a dark shield. As though one
needed reminding of that!
Dashing Mrs. A. J. Patrick (she was
Joan Meynell before the beautiful young
man who played King Love in “Every-
woman” made himself her husband a couple
of years back) has a walking-on part in
Lewis Waller’s “Beaucaire.” The lady has
only to look handsome, and she can do that
without trying.
One of Melbourne’s beauty girls, who,
however, is not really and truly in Sassiety,
recently spent a bx-ief fortnight in Sydney,
and has been pursued homewards by an
intimation that she must hold herself ready
to co-respond when called upon —unless her
alleged partner in indiscretion can manage
to keep the case out of court.
Another Hobart girl has attached a naval
man. Leila Gibson, of the great Tasmanian
sheep clan, is the girl, and Lieutenant J. N.
Howie, of H.M.S. Sealark, is the lucky
sailor.
Some local girls lost their chauffeur lately
while motoring in Tasmania. He wasn’t
carried off by Death, as you might suppose,
but by the police, who wanted him worse
than the girls or Death did.
Vivian Parker is to take the racing yacht
Killara round to Sydney, and act as skipper
during the February water-flights, the owner
of the craft being unable to spare the time
to take the tiller himself. Viv. Parker afloat
reminds one of old times, especially since
his one-time brother-in-law, Charlie Wallace,
is once more takinsr an interest in the sport.
Mrs. Viv., a dashing, Titian-haired beauty,
and the elder sister of Ruby Wallace, has
been flatting in New York, but will return to
Australia in time to see the boats up-anchor.
Hair dyeing is becoming a fearsome busi-
ness in Paris. Some of the smartest re-
turned voyagers declare they have not yet
the moral courage to do worse than color
their locks a fiery red ; but the Parisian ex-
tremists are defying Nature and coloring
their natural thatches weird blues and
greens. The color idiocy is exhaustive to all
bar the ash-blonde ; any darker tint requires
preliminary bleaching. To be really chic
you dye your hair, your furs and your
poodle all the same color, so that the passer-
by can see at a glance to what degraded
dog you and your furs belong. How any-
body can say that woman is not the intel-
lectual equal of man —!
The Palais de Danse is the essence of
stodginess—much to the disappointment of
the suburban saints, who had expected to
gaze on Wickedness from the safe elevation
of the Esplanade. The facade of the place
is glittering (in accordance with the oldest
saintly traditions of Vice), but the hall be-
yond, which is open to St. Kilda’s observing
eye, merely shows solemnly-revolving
couples who seem oppressed by the weight
of the moral responsibility they are bearing.
A crowd of watchers collects on the Espla-
nade above; they pay nothing, but, like all
deadheads, they criticise keenly. A fashion-
able ballroom, especially after supper, would
provide just what the most moral gazers are
looking for. In the Palais, no wealthy
squatter-johnnie ever approaches a richly-
gilded heiress with the polite query, “This
is our little tummy-rub, I think?” as hap-
pened audibly in one of the Very Best ball-
rooms the other week.
A packed congregation attended at the
Savoy on New Year’s Eve. A special ser-
vice had been arranged for the occasion, in-
cluding the release of a number of pigeons
with trinkets attached. Every woman who
was able to catch a pigeon (those they had
brought with them were disqualified) won
its more or less precious cargo. An in-
spiring moment was when tlxe Most Ro-
mantic Actor at present in Melbourne, moved
by the pathetic little gasps and starts of
his leading lady, who was cut to the heart
by the fiutterings of the scared birds, rose
to his feet and addressed the assembly in
shocked tones, exclaiming: “Gentlemen,
haven’t we had enough of this? It isn’t
sport!” Females in his vicinity at once
felt a throb of sympathy for the pigeons;
but the manly protest was scarcely audible
above the chatter and the screeching, so the
picturesquely indignant mummer had to re-
sume his seat without a single “hand.”
Mixed bathing, under conditions which
even Mrs. Grundy would wink at, is going
strong at Kenny’s Ladies’ Baths, St. Kilda,
every week-day from 6 to 9 a.m. On the
Sabbath morn the sexes are at liberty to
mingle in the sea for an hour longer—six
to 10. Mr. “Bill” Kenny, who manages the
baths, and personally supervises these “Con-
tinental” gatherings, has long been keen on
the idea of an enclosed mix, but it was not
until last summer that he got some of the
Very Best people to come along in family
parties and make the desired splash. Now
that he has got the clientele, he wants a
larger hath area. St. Ivilda is little else
than boarding-houses these times, and every
boarding-house could send forth its own
little _ mixed contingent on a balmy early
morning. Already the toniest caravanserais
are supplying the new and reprobated
“Palais”, with bunches of two-steppers on
balmy nights, and the mixed waltz is intro-
ductory to the mixed wash.
It is a severe wrench for women dog-
fanciers to leave for a foreign sprint.
Quarantine restrictions and merciful anti-
dog laws that sailors keep handy make the
life of the person who takes her dog with
her hardly worth living. So the yelping
darlings are nearly always left at home.
Mrs. Keep and daughter Heather, whose
hearts beat responsive to every bark, left
last week for England, after solemnly in-
ducting their friends into the charge of their
various treasures. The temporary keepers
are having an anxious time. A baby can
always be anchored safely in the house; but
a treasure that has four good legs to run
away on, and is perpetually threatened with
fleas, is a really serious proposition.
A crateful of panting Christmas ducks
had been dumped from a country train on
Toorak station. The birds were waiting
open-beaked for death, when a hurried but
humane porter pushed them under a water-
tap that was dripping briskly. At once the
crate became a mass of fluttering wings and
delighted quacks. Hot railway passengers
who witnessed the little act of charity mur-
mured their appreciation, and a fat man.
who looked as if he always overate himself
on principle, puffed along and stirred them
up with his walking stick, so they would
all get a share of the water and arrive in
better condition at the table.
A very grand female is taking an interest
in a forthcoming charity spree. Another
grand female wants to be interested, but
won’t if the first stupendous lady is in-
volved. The organisers of the charity are
perspiring freely over the problem in social
strategy, for though both of them want to
work for charity, neither of them is charit-
able enough to work with the other. Don’t
some people make you tired !
Flying has taken its proper place in the
columns of the fashionable journals. The
writers thereof describe the latest designs
in flying dresses, mention who flew, and
where, and, finally, record the fact that
Mrs. Altitude or Miss Flighty has gone to
Cannes, or the dogs or elsewhere, to recover
from her recent flying accident. Appen-
dicitis is not in it now with a fall from the
blue. . 1 foresee, too, that the girl who has
been indiscreet will not now be referred to
as “one of the fallen.”
The young woman who allows her dusty
fiance or otherwise to bounce her round the
country in a side-car had better persuade
him to fix an extra lamp on the wheeled
armchair. The sputtering couples are very
numerous on the military road that curves
round the bay, and they go hopping along
at night with just one light on the cycle side.
Even the conscientious driver (I understand
there are a few of them about), observing
the one light, may just allow road-space for
an unaccompanied “road flea”- —the Euro-
nean nickname for the hooping travellers.
The girl who sits perilously on the
seat behind the driver is much safer (in a
traffic sense) than the lady of the unlighted
armchair.
The Arts and Crafts Club is to have a
whole gallery of the Exhibition barn at the
A. outbreak this year, instead of being
shoved into the usual corner. The vote and
interest of a vice-regal dame are certainly a
great help.
“Rosna’s” notes from London:—
Ruth Bannister, the artistic Sydney-side girl, has
had a royal command, or, rather, her wood-carving
has. Her panels of waratah and grapes, which have
been on view at the Lyceum Club, are to pay a visit
to Buckingham Palace, where Queen Mary will be
pleased to cast her royal eye over them.
Several talented young Maorilanders are among the
would-be mummers toiling at Tree’s Academy of
Dramatic Art. One is Marjorie Butler, a Wellington
girl whose father was a Judge of the Maori courts.
Another is Shayle Gardner, a lengthy youth who is a
nephew of the Bishop Boyd Carpenters. Probably,
however, the Church and the Stage are not yet
sufficiently allied to make the connection very useful
in this city of much wirepulling.
Millais’s “Diana Vernon,” Edward Stott’s “Re-
turning Home” and Sargent’s “Autumn Leaves” are
the latest notable purchases for the Melbourne Gal-
lery. The Adelaide Gallery scores with “Sowing the
Seed,” a fine picture by William Orpen, secured at a
cost of £7OO. Margaret Macpherson, the Adelaide
artist, was commissioned by the S.A. Government to
look at this for the City of Culchaw. The bronze
puma, bv Swan, recently secured by this same damsel
and Will Ashton, is said to be honestly worth several
hundreds more than the price paid.
Lillah McCarthy, who is Mrs. Granville Barker,
inherits a useful little pile through the death of her
father, Jonadab McCarthy, F.R.A.S., who was an
authority on the geology of the Cotswolds. The fair
Lillah’s share will, it is said, amount to something
like £50,000, and this should indirectly be an aid
to the repertory movement. With a useful wife like
that, Granville Barker should be able to play what he
likes, no matter what the silly old public wants.
From my Adelaide correspondent:—
The Sturt statue fund is increasing so slowly that
I expect to he quite dead before the memorial is
erected. One donation outstands like a bright night-
light. J. H. Symon has given £25, and he will make
it £5O if ten £5 contributors can be found.
Miss Mary Gavin Gardner is engaged to Dr. J. E.
MeGlasham. He is a B.Sc. and an M. 8., and she a
B. Do you wonder at Foster Fraser’s eulogy of the
Adelaidean intellect ?
Governor Allardyce, of the Falkland Islands, stayed
the night at the Max Andersons, and dined with the
Bosanquets at Marble Hill, before joining the English
tnailship. He has governed the Falklands since 1904.
In addition, he is not only a cricketer but a jour-
nalist.
The Ways are at Sea View, their farm near Noarlunga.
He is convalescing in the guarded way that is essen-
tial at his time of life.
Everybody—meaning most of the people with money
—is away, which has been bad luck for Anderson’s
theatrical co. and Paul Dufault and other showmen.
Most of our ancient noblesse are at Victor Harbor.
The 11. S. and P. M. Newlands, for example, one or
two of the Stirling clan, and Mrs. Dudley Hayward
and her two sons. On New Year’s Day the Governor,
unflinchingly resolute as ever, attended the local
regatta, Captain Fletcher aiding him. Mr. Dutton,
jun., stood him lunch, and the head of the family—
he of the R.Y.S. —gave the vice-regal party the use
of his yacht. So, altogether, lI.E. did the thing in
moderate comfort.
Commemoration Day was celebrated by a hot
luncheon in an absolutely boiling Town Hail ; and a
tepid luncheon (nothing was really cold that sizzling
day) for the women pioneers downstairs. The
Mayoress looked after her guests in the intervals of
mopping her fevered brow, assisted by Lady Bosan-
quet and her daughters, the Butler dame, Mrs. Rounse-
vcll, Mrs. F. W. Ralph, Mrs. S. J. Jacobs, Miss Law
Smith and Mrs. Fowler Stewart; all of whom did a
good deal of brow-mopping themselves.
There was an impressive and expensive crowd at
the second day of the Port Adelaide Christmas meet-
ing. In the two days over £36,000 went through
the Tote. Puringa broke his leg at the starting-post,
and had to be destroyed. A number of other things
—lunches, teas, violent disappointments, flirtations,
gown exhibits, and so forth—also transpired, but the
above-mentioned episodes were the most important.
The new stipendiary stewards got busy promptly
at Morphettville on New Year’s Day. Half a dozen
jockeys were fined for being late, and owners were
warned solemnly that in future disreputable colors
and ruined gear in general would not be passed. This
to those racing-men who for years have clung to
mouldy old caps and jackets, rusty stirrups and a
strip of sacking for a saddle-cloth was a bitter, bitter
blow. Under the new regime Private Enterprise is
to be interfered with seemingly to the extent of even
being debarred from the luxury of dirtiness. The rac-
ing was good, and the St. Leonards Handicap yielded
a £123 dividend, Robona being the responsible agent.
Airmen have no luck at flying in Adelaide. At the
first attempt, several years ago, the imported machine
was burnt before it could make an ascent. The
second model swerved in rising, cut off a boy’s hand
in the pressing crowd and gave up the game. Last
week A. W. Jones got fairly going, and made two
gate-money ascents from Cheltenham racecourse, with
other successful spins on his own account—once with
a lady passenger. Then one morning he flew right
over Adelaide, and kept on for five miles, lost his
way in returning, ran out of petrol, and had to do
a grand volplane. A swift descent is very like a fall,
and the last 80ft. of it was so much of the real thing
that the man was knocked out for an hour or two,
and the machine for a week or two. But plucky
Jones says it was sheer bad luck, and he means to be
up again shortly.
The lady who flew with Jones, as before-mentioned,
is the daughter of the licensee of the Gresham Hotel.
Yours affectionately.
JOHANNA.

“Kuscobin”: It’s not every man knows when he’s
on a really good thing—quality calls to quality just
as deep calls to deep. But there are some good
things no man can miss—and one of them is Helidon
Spa. Just you watch the connoisseur call for his
drink next time you’re in a high-class bar. No doubt
about him —he says right off “Whisky and Helidon.”
Sometimes he 6ays this or that brand of whisky—
but he’ll say “Helidon” every time. The wine drinker,
too—hear him call foy “Claret and Helidon” these
hot days—he knows that just asking for Spa may
mean anything down to plain Sodawater. That’s
the tip—and it’s well worth remembering. Always
split it with “Helidon” and you’ll give a sparkle, a
snap to your favorite liquor that brings out the best
that is in it. So healthy too —Helidon Spa is the
only true Australian Mineral water that has genuine
Osmotic qualities—therefore now and at all times
“Cornstalk”: It does an Australian good to travel,
if only to find out how good Australia is. I’ve
lately been about Germany and the Continent of
Europe a deal, and used always be meeting folk
going to “take the waters.” There’s no doubt these
Mineral Springs in Europe do a lot of good, but I
was surprised to come across a statement in the
Lancet some time ago definitely stating that our
own Helidon Spa was the finest mineral water in the
world. I tell you this was a startler to me, but
since I’ve been back I’ve tried it and quite agree
with the Lancet. The best whisky and the best
wine both taste better still if you split them
with Helidon. A doctor chap explained to me
that the reason of that was that Helidon had a high
percentage of Lithium—it mellows the whisky and
prevents that next-morning head by eliminating any
noxious ingredients from the system. So it does too
—you take my tip and always
Split it with
HELIDON SPA.
ABORIGIN-
ALITIES
Tooth is mighty and shall prevail! Bella
Singh, a Hindoo, caught his hand between two cog-
wheels and damaged it badly. He was carted to a
pub and left there till the doctor was brought. Saw-
bones tied up the hand and then decided that Singh
could do with a bath, so he ordered one. But Bella
wouldn’t be washed by anyone who wasn’t a Hindoo,
and as there wasn’t another Hindoo handy he re-
mained dirty. Then the doctor ordered a feed; but
the Hindoo struck again, because the tucker wasn’t
cooked by one of his faith. So he starved for four
days. Then a sympathetic stranger took pity and
offered him a drink. Instantly there was a change.
Singh didn’t wait to find out whether the man who
THE OBLIGING PARENT.
“I told your father I couldn't live without
you."
“ What did he say?"
“He offered to pay my funeral expenses."
was shouting was Hindoo or Esquimo. He just had
the beer and said nothing. Perhaps there is a pro-
viso in the Book of Caste Rules and Regulations
excepting the real necessaries of life from all restric-
tions. If there isn’t, then Bella Singh’s soul is
doomed.
“Eddyson”: This is the story of the
simplest woman I never knew. Her name was
Agnes (pronounced “Hagoness”) and she was the
lawful wife of John Henry Spotswood, of Gin’s
Hill (Vic.). Men tire easily of simple women like
Hagoness, especially when they have the pale,
pathetic, obtruding eyes of a hapless nanny, and
wear fawn freckles. John Henry tired of his wife,
and after about 10 years determined upon his course
of action. The recent death of Lemmon had opened
a way of escape for him. He put several small
articles in a gin case, and, driving his grey horse
Geordie, and leading his cattle pup, he went openly
over the hill to the habitation of the widow Emily
Lemmon, which henceforth was his postal address.
Mrs. Spotswood made no outcry. She seemed a
trifle dubious about her rights for a time, but on
the fifth day after Spotswood’s change of residence
she went across to Mrs. Lemmon’s in her old sun-
bonnet, and put her head in at Mrs. Lemmon’s kit-
chen door. Spotswood and the widow were at mid-
day dinner. “Will you gimme me husband, Mrs.
Lemmon ?” said Mrs. Spotswood. On second thought
she added “please.” “I will not,” said the widow.
Mrs. Spotswood lingered for a few moments, as
though half-inclined to think something remained to
be said; then she turned and went home. That
night there was a tap at Mrs. Lemmon’s window,
and Mrs. Spotswood’s voice said: “Gimme me hus-
band, will you ?” Mrs. Lemmon made no repty, and
20 minutes later a voice at the keyhole said:
“Gimme me husband!” After that, whenever Mrs.
Spotswood had 10 minutes to spare, she went over
the hill to widow Lemmon’s, and asked at a window,
or a keyhole, or any handy crack, for the return of
her wayward husband. Her request was wholly dis-
passionate ; it was more like the appeal of a house-
wife requesting the return of a borrowed stewpan
than the heartfelt plea of a grass-widowed woman
for restitution of valuable conjugal property. This
course of conduct was continued for five months ;
meanwhile Hagoness managed the poultry farm and
the bees, and made no complaint among her neigh-
bors. But, finding that several hundred respectful
requests breathed about the domicile of Mrs. Lemmon
had produced no results, Mrs. Spotswood went into
the Springs, seeking legal advice. She knew she
had been deprived of property and rights that were
hers in the eye of the law, and she put her case
somewhat ambiguously to constable Tom Elphin-
ston. “If somebody takes somethin’ what’s mine,
what do I do?”,asked Hagoness. The constable ex-
plained the usual procedure in such a case, and in
due time the suit of Agnes Spotswood against Emily
Lemmon, widow, came on for hearing. Neither
party Was represented by counsel, and Mrs. Spots-
wood was immediately non-suited. She had pro-
ceeded against Emily for petty larceny. Having
exhausted the law, Agnes fell back upon her own
methods. She continued to pay calls on the widow
Lemmon, and to put her reasonable request to that
lady through the cracks or at the bedroom window.
Now and again she wrote letters couched in inoffen-
sive language, calling upon Mrs. Lemmon to deliver
up John Henry Spotswood by return, but .these, too,
were without effect on the wicked widow of Gin's
Hill. For two months “Jumbo” Tutt, a fruit-
grower up the creek, had been down with a serious
illness, and Mrs. Spotswood had been nursing him.
“Jumbo” arose a very grateful man. Mrs. Spots-
wood refused to take his money, and Tutt swore
a booming oath, and said that if there was anything
he could do for Mrs. Spotswood, short of laying down
his life, he would do it. “I’d like me husband
persuaded to come back,” said Hagoness. This hap-
pened at a quarter past four in the afternoon. At
twenty minutes to six “Jumbo” Tutt drove up to
Mrs. Spotswood’s door. He had Mr. Spotswood in
the dray. John Henry was a pitiful spectacle; he
had two black eyes that resembled over-ripe figs, his
left ear was like a toy balloon, his nose was a pal-
pable misfit, and he was so utterly used up after a
long and horrible fight that “Jumbo” had to carry
him from the dray to the colonial sofa in Mrs. Spots-
wood’s front room. “He’s come back to you, ma’am,
free and hearty,” said “Jumbo,” and Hagoness, kneel-
ing by John Henry, gazing through her tears at his
blasted head, murmured joyfully: “I knew he on’y
needed a little persuadin’, bless ’im!”
“II.S.”: In Malekula (New Hebrides
group) feasting time comes round with the ripening
of the yams. The feasts are given by men aspiring
to chieftainship, of which there are four grades—the
bara, gulgul, mulun and mara. All below the rank
of bara are commoners, whilst the mara is the high-
est dignity to which the heathen aspires, and very
few reach it. The entrance to all of these ranks is
by the giving of feasts, at which enormous numbers
of pigs are slaughtered. The tucker must be of the
male gender, with long tusks, and in order that the
tusks may not be injured the boars are tied with
about six inches of rope to a tree stump for years.
The tusks curl round and re-enter the jaw and pro-
trude on the other side, to curl round again. The
suffering of these sacred pigs is terrible. Ordinary
teeth are knocked out to give play for the big tusk,
and a tusk that has pierced the jawbone is especially
prized. The real god of the Malekulans is the pig.
Two or three atone for all crimes against property
or person, ten purchase him a wife, a hundred tuskers
slaughtered at intervals raise him to the rank of mara,
while his happiness in the next world depends on
the number sacrificed at his funeral. Recently, an
old chief, finding his end approaching, and anxious
that his funeral should be duly honored with the
highest ceremonial, sold off his seven wives in order
to raise a. further 70 pigs to add to the sacrificial
herd. There is also some slight idea of a blood
atonement. If a man has committed a crime, or
two tribes have been at war and desire to bury the
hatchet, pigs are brought to the public square, where
friendship is renewed by the chief killing one with
a spear, saying, as the blood flows, “It is peace.”
It is, as far as the pig is concerned, anyway.
A VOLIE FACE.

“Nope! The Ups that touch
water shall never touch
mine."
“Gip”: Are foxes snake exterminators?
Some bushmen round here (Monaro) say they are.
Shearers and “down country” men (everything’s
“down” from here) “take their colonial” that where
foxes are thick snakes grow beautifully less. An
old grey-beard assured me that he “got” two foxes
with a strychnine-powdered snake last summer when
the raiders had grown too cunning to consider the
commonly-used suet.
’ POSSUM-HUNTING IN THE FUTURE.
“Lagani-Namo”: The R.C. Mission head-
quarters at Yule Island (Papua) is a complete little
cosmopolitan colony. The priests and lay-brother
tradesmen hail from all parts of Europe, and the
settlement is easily the most progressive in Papua,
When all Port Moresby’s food came out of tins,
Yule was eating fresh beef, bread and vegetables.
(The beef was preserved under dripping, and kept
indefinitely.) Among its other adjuncts were a
printing press, a telephone and a still. I’ve heard
Scotsmen declare that Yule’s barley-bree was the
.......
veritable balm-of-Gilead. One of its best virtues
was that it was gratis to whoever had time to call
in passing. One day Lieut.-Governor Wm. Macgregor
happened to do the calling, and the guileless bro-
ther-in-command invited him to criticise their
spirits. “ ’Tis beyond criticism,” said Mac Willie.
But he had to remember, as head governing official,
that it was contrary to the law, and when the
Merrie England departed the still went with her.
“Fisho” : Was out at Warrnambool (Vic.)
the other day, looking for something to eat, when a
commotion on the sandy bank of the river attracted my
attention. Went along to reconnoitre, and found a nice
mullet, still alive and kicking, but high and dry
about a foot from the water. He had lost his tail,
and plainly the accident was very recent. Within a
yard of him was the cause of the commotion —a big
barracouta, who in the excitement of the chase had
neglected to take sound-
ings, and was conse-
quently stranded also. I
seized the opportunity—
or rather both of the op-
portunities. The mullet
was evidently an aider-
man in the fish world,
judging by his girth
amidships ; but the ’couta
was the longest and lean-
est of his kind I had ever
seen, although I have put
in many hours in the
’couta boats catching
“axe-handles,” as the fish-
ermen call them on ac-
count of their length,
breadth and curves.
Strange to say, although
sharks, stingrays and
every other marine ani-
mal short of sperm
whales are frequently
seen and caught in this
river, the ’couta is a very rare visitor, some of the
oldest fishermen declaring that they have never seen
one inside the bar.
“Gip”: Met a cannibal tom cat last week
and on the day of introduction he ate our fafnily
of seven kittens. My attention was first attracted
by the mother’s growls and hisses as she stood out-
side the nursery in the garden, fierce as a tigress.
The strange tom was just disappearing with a kitten
in his mouth. I went inside, and again the mother
cried out in distress. I rushed to the rescue in time
to see Gabbett disappearing with a second
kitten. While I watched, the brute kept off, though
I sometimes caught sight of his greedy yellow eyes
glaring from the long grass. By nightfall the bewil-
dered mother was wandering round the garden paths
with her one remaining kitten in her mouth. I
did not actually see any eating or killing done, but
next morning found the body of the seventh kitten
minus head and shoulders. And nobody can con-
vince me that the little thing chewed off its own
head.

THE CREEK.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
’Twixt high banks on either side
Dark and slow its waters glide;
Sombre, down its course it creeps,
Secret with unlitten deeps.
Ancient trees in serried ranks
Halt their armies at its banks;
Drawn along the neutral space
Stand they ever, face to face.
And, while those old soldiers stand,
Fronted down each narrow strand,
From their source, in mountains high,
Endless march the waters by :
As when through the parted throng
Pageants gravely wind along,
Bearing in procession past
Emblems of their creed or caste.
Where it rounds some shaded bight,
Deep its pools, and dark as night;
There the sun in vain essays
Entry to its guarded ways.
There it is the fish-folk glide
Shadowy in its sluggish tide,
Lurking into stony rifts
Where the under-current drifts.
Down its livelier fluxes sail
Vagrant leaves and petals pale,
Flotsam from the tangled glooms,
Smitten buds and ravished blooms.
Dark and slow its waters move,
Down its deep and ancient groove ;
Drawn for ever towards the sea
Through a dim futurity.

YOUR ADVANTAGES.
There are a number of distinct ADVANTAGES TO YOURSELF in buying a Beale Piano in preference to any other. Here are
some of them :
1. You make a Big Saving in Price, Quality for Quality. , j
You buy your Beale Piano direct from the factory, without paying profits to any middlemen or agents,
without paying the 35 per cent. Customs duty.
2. You get a Better=toned Piano. ■ T c 1 ct Pe i
Beale Pianos have a most harmonious, mellow, delightful tone. They con am e Y time
tuning-system ever invented, and by means of this device the tunmg-pins are e makes the
confining all sound to the sounding-board , which is the only proper construction. This
piano more durable, because the iron frame alone bears all the tremendous strainl (nearly 30 tomi) of the two
hundred and sixteen tightly-stretched steel strings. This construction cannot be had m any other pianos.
3. A Better=toned Piano because, also, of the Violin=like Sounding Board.
Only Beale Pianos contain sounding-boards constructed on the same principle as a_ vialm- y.
construction, and onr secret sounding-board varnish, are lesponsible or a sp en lasting The
favor with singers especially. The Beale tone is sympathetic, sweet, mellow, sonorous
tone of Beale Pianos, beautiful at first, improves with use. This is the sure test of y
constructed piano.
withstand the Australian climate better than pianos which are made m cold, wet countries.
5. Your Beale Piano will have a Better Touch. . -p vfm
We supply a better “ action ’’-one of the most expensive parts of the instrument-m Beak Pianos than you
find in any other pianos of similar price. We supply the recognised best action ill the world m g q
Beale Pianos, whereas you must pay not less than /105 for an imported piano containing the same a t
system. It provides that perfect touch demanded by master-pianists.
You train bv the Uniaue Experience of probably the Greatest Piano Expert in the World.
6 - Y ° U /ssociaS with theTunderofthis Company" (Mr. oT. Beale) is Mr. George D.
Director of Messrs. John Broadwood & Sons, London, now acting exclusively i 8 ""™ f . L .
Factory Manaeer Mr Rose is the third generation m his family to devote a lifetime to high-grade plan
making. Hefas had a unique experience fn all branches of the art in !
Germany, France and America, and is recognised m Europe as probably the “Pert in tone
production in the world. He has invented epoch-making improvements in pianos. He was for over twelve
years President of the British Piano Makers’ Association.
7 You get a Written Guarantee from us—the MAKERS—for twenty=five years.
No other maker guarantees his pianos for such a lengthy period-ten years is the usual thing. But we now
liow Beale Pianos are constructed, and we know they will last longer than any others. In any case, if you
W anfmported pSio yon will find that the guarantee (if any) thereon will not be of much value to yon, as
the mak™ is in Europe, twelve thousand miles distant from you; whereas we are here, m Australia, with all
onr interests in Australia, ready to support our guarantee on the spot.
q Onlv Beale Pianos have auite Reliable Bass=strings. ... ~
y You know that in all pianos the strings (steel wires) in the bass portion are wound with copperror
to make them heavier, and thus afford the necessary slow vibrations. In Beale Pianos these steel wires are
six sided instead of round, and thus afford a firm grip for the copper winding. Consequently no Beale Plan
ever develops Wing noises caused by loose binding of the bass-strings. Other Pianos have round steel wire m
the bass, affording no secure grip for the copper. Six-sided steel wire costs more than twice as much as the round.
Q You vet a Piano which is built only of Tested Parts. . . , , •
Every part—every detail—of every Beale Piano is tested and scrupulously examined before it is embodied m
the instrument. The slightest flaw in material or workmanship and the part is entirely rejected.
in Your Beale Piano is Guaranteed Against Damage in Transit. . ,
We take the entire risk of damage in delivery of the Beale Piano right up to your door : you take no r .
If it should be damaged by any mischance, we make it good, or supply another piano of equal quality.
11 In case of Damage while in use, your Beale Piano is Easily Repaired. . ,
We are th e makers of the Beale Pianos, and our factory is here in Australia. Therefore, if any part of your
Beale Piano should °-et damaged through accident or carelessness we can always supply new parts at low cost,
and the iiano is restored as good as new. How could you obtain new parts for a foreign piano ? The agents
dfnot ca P rry stocks or S pare parts, and they have no factory facilities for making them, either. We can make
or renew any part of any Beale Piano at any time.
If vou make a careful study of such advantages as other firms offer you, and compare them with the foregoing, you are sure
tocome'toHie conclusion that you will be getting most benefit by obtaining a Beale Piano. Study what we have said above
think it all over—and you will say that it is just simple common-sense reasoning.

TRIED IT ON THE HORSE.
“When driving from Tamworth to Bowling Alley
Point one of my horses took bad with gripes, and
got down kicking and struggling,” says Mr. Sam
L. Pyrke, of Bowling Alley Point, N.S.W. “Those
who passed me considered the horse would die. As
I always carry Chamberlain’s Colic, Cholera and
Diarrhoea Remedy for my own use in case of emer-
gency, I put a whole bottle of it in half a pint of
water and gave it to the horse. In less than a
quarter of an hour he was up and started to feed.

“You should never drink with meals if you

a time when I could hardly eat a meal with-
out suffering afterwards. I followed the
advice rigidly, and, although I was somewhat
relieved, still suffered a good deal. I tried

beneficial effect until a medical friend recom-
mended taking about half a teaspoonful of
ordinary bisurated magnesia in half a cup-
ful of warm water after each meal and at

“Xox” : Much information has been dis-
bursed concerning the homing instincts of cats,
horses and prodigal sons, but apparently no-one has
noticed that it is very pronounced also in reptiles.
Drinkwater and I drew a £lO prize in Tatts., and
vve considered the occasion sufficiently momentous to
require celebration. Aided and abetted by divers
bottles, we celebrated for two days. Then Nemesis
arrived. Blue snakes, green snakes, spotted snakes
with red lights on their tails, and vari-colored snakes
poked the tongue of scorn at us, gambolled before us
contemptuously, and threw back-somersaults at us
with an abandon that nearly drove us mad. At last
we could stand it no longer. We tore out of the
hut and raced through the serub to the railway
station like the kangaroo on the postage stamp flee-
ing before the wrath of Agar Wynne. The snakes
were in close attendance. We clambered into an
empty truck and pulled a tarpaulin over us, but the
shakes got in under it and taunted uS with dur
helplessness. Then the truck was picked up and wd
were carried 106 miles before a disrespectful porter
pulled us out and insulted us. The snakes were still
with usy but after a sleep in the park we awoke to
find them gone. Elated, we returned to the station
and jumped the rattler" back to our siding, accom-
panied by four bottles of rum. The station-master
helpfid us along the road, and when we reached our
lint there Werfe' all i he ktiafeeg Waiting for us. Thev
hald outpaced th£ ifditi:
* * *
‘ Rangan”: I was dispehsef at a btish
hospital at the time, and not more than a yohrfgsitei.
One morning a navvy was brought in badly crushed
from a fall of earth, and we knew he couldn't last',
lie was the father of eight kiddies, and apologised
for the' missus not coming to see him, as she was
busy with the flock. After three days he passed out,
and I Was sent to break the news to the widow. On
the three-mile hoof to the home I conjured up a
weeping, heart-broken woman with a babe at her
breast and several at foot, aftd turned over in my
mind various ways of getting rid of the tidings in
“ sympathetic manner. 1 pictured in a dozen ways
the teair-stained face and the hoineful of crying
children', find thought Of 20 Ways Of Offering “the
ttibute of fny sOrrOW. At the gate 1 met a bare-
legged urchin going t 6 School, a’ncf told him to wait,
as I had bad news for his mother. Site appeared at
my knock, a fine, big, busy-looking woman, with
arms bare to the elbows. In a brisk tone she in-
quired my business. With gasps and stutters I
delivered my news, and waited for the breakdown.
It came, addressed to the boy who was waiting at
the gate: “Johnny, just tell Jimmy ’is father is
dead, and don't forget the sausages.”
Tekelo : The Islands have become drab
and respectable. The trail of petticoat and tourist
is Over them all. No longer is “steamer time” a carnival
of singing, high jinks and walpurgis deeds. The spick
and span have arrived, aiid the oid-timers are moving
On and out. It is regrettable that, with these will dlis
dppear a wonderful stoVe Of Island lore and history.
They know the Islands as nO Other men Will ever
know them. Trading in file SoiomOns, down to 15
years ago, offered mote than the average risk. On
rare occasions, nowadays, when the tOmUanf, of the
Old Brigade foregather, one hears littlV phfasOs more
eloquent than books: “Oh ! Jack What’s-i S-name, Who
was chopped at Rendova about 15 years ago” ; or
That s Peter, brother to the chap who went under
at Simbo” ; or “Fergie, who was finished by his
boat’s-crew at Alu” ; or, “Poor old Fin, who was
hacked by those Bombatana people.” On the GiZo
foreshore stands a headstone, part of whose inscrip-
tion reads:—
Erected to the Memory of “The Old Commodore,”
CAPTAIN WOODHOUSE.
The Pioneer Trader of the Solomons for 35 years.
He died a natural death. But what a book he could
have written!
PROOF ENOUGH.
BULLOCKY : "When's Dan Lewis coming back
from Sydney? ”
BUSHMAN (returned from Sydney): “I didn't
see Dan in Sydney."
BULLOCKY: "Well, by Cripes! He went
away with his carpet bag packed a couple
of days after you, and pitched he was going
to Sydney. But I reckon he was only
skitin’, after all!"
THE EXPLANATION.
DERELICT : “I suppose you won’t believe me, Nellie, when I tell you that I was born
with a silver spoon in my mouth.”
NELLIE (enlightened): "Cook an ’ me was wondering what made it so large."
“Geebung’’: I wonder how many Abo-
readers have seen the mistletoe bird, the little chap
that spreads the mistletoe from tree to tree. He is
something like a robin, but red-headed, and very
shy. His residence is unlike that of any other bird
I have ever seen, being made of cobwebs, woven
together like a piece of silk and formed into a bag
more like an old-fashioned watch-pocket than any-
thing else, This is fastened over a slender limb of
a tree, and has the ehtrance at one side. And you
ought to-see the quantities of the fruit of the mistle-
toe the proprietor can put away at a sitting! No
wonder the pest spreads.

“Gouger”: Working alongside of me in an
open cut not long ago was a man we called “the
Mad Swede.” He would swing his heavy pick with
almost maniacal energy, bringing down showers of
earth that suggested a miniature landslide. Now
and again he’d rest on his pick, glare
at the “face,” then burst into long
peals of laughter. We forgave him,
because he did more work than the four
of us put together. “What’s he doing
to you now, Switzer?” I asked, when
one day he laughed louder and longer
than usual. He looked at me and said
quietly: “She hold out her arms to me,
like before she died. My little girl!
But ze doctor; ze cursed doctor, he
always hold her back! Oh, my little
girl, I shall reach you yet!” With one
of his awful laughs the Swede turned
again to the “face,” and the loose earth
avalanched from his pick. We found
out afterwards that the death of his
baby daughter years before had turned
his brain. The wet season was on us,
and the big, open-cut became dangerous
to work. Masses of earth and rock,
loosened by the heavy rains, would slip
from the granite bottom with a crash.
One night there was a terrific thunder-
storm, and next day, just before noon,
there was an ominous crunching, fol-
lowed immediately by a warning cry.
We all sprang back except the Swede.
He stood there, madder than usual that
morning, working frenziedlv under the
crumbling bank. We shouted, and
shouted again. The roots of a big tree
creaked, as the weight of earth slid
from high over the bank. Then it
came, a roar, a moving wall of earth, of
bounding rocks and dragging treees. The Swede
vanished, as a fly would under a boot. Though it
took us only 20 minutes to dig him out, he was
dead. But if he’d got a fair deal he had found his
little daughter again.
* * * *
Jobber : N. or M.” and his Tasmanian
pal “Maurice Weston” (B. 20/11/’l3) remind me of
old Jacky Dow, on the Murrumbidgee. Jacky never
refused a man work, and set chaps at some queer
jobs He had one opening and closing a gate all day ;
another bailing out a fair-sized waterhole with a
pannikin. He put one cove wheeling stones in a
barrow from one paddock to another, and then put
him to wheel them back again. A Yankee struck
the station once, and the old man set him turning a
grindstone. After dinner, the boss went to see how
the job was going, and found his nibs in a ham-
mock reading and working the stone by an arrange-
ment he’d fixed up with an old bicycle. Jacky fired
him on the spot.
O.B.”: Bill and I had the night of our
lives when we struck Melbourne. When the last
pub door banged we started for nowhere in particu-
lar and finished up on the steps of Parliament
House. I was sleeping soundly when two fire
engines, with sparks pouring from the funnels,
dashed madly down from Eastern Hill on their way
to a call. But Bill saw, through drink-sodden eyes,
these monsters come and vanish with a rattle into
the blackness of the night. The first I knew of the
proceedings was the fool kicking me madly and
shouting, “Gorstruth, Jim, wake up ! Mishd sight of
a lifetime! Gorblime! They’re moving Hell; I jest
seen two cartloads go past.”
“Wilder”: If I was the judge I wo.uld say
that Jobson won the Maddest Hatter Stakes. He
had a mania for telephones. Just outside his stringy-
bark humpy a kerosene tin with the top cut out was
nailed through one side to the top of a stump. Dang-
ling from the open end was the receiver, which con-
sisted of an old hollow saucepan-handle. A string
proceeding from the tin led in a circular direction ;
it was about 300 yards long, and was fastened at in-
tervals to trees. It ultimately ended in another kero-
sene tin on top of another post. Jobson’s hut was
about a hundred yards from the creek ; it was built
on a flat that had been tipped on its end, which
meant that Jobson had to yakker hard to haul up his
armful of firewood or his cans of water. If the
’phone “rang” during his ascent, he would drop his
load and scramble like blazes up the incline to his
end, grab the saucepan-handle and yell: “Hullo!
Who’s there? This is Ben Jobson speaking.” Then
dropping the receiver he would streak to the other
end and shout, “That’s you, is it, Jobson? This is
Thompson speaking. Mr. Hooley says if yer like to
bring yer rabbit skins ter town, he’ll give yer eighteen
pence a pound for ’em.” Jobson would then career
back to his end and scream: “Tell Hooley ter keep
his blarsted eighteen-pence, d’yer ’ear! I kin set
nineteen and a ’arf from old Billy, the ’ide-buyer
and he calls fer > em ’ imse lf.” Jobson would baM
repeat this pantomime three or four times during the
process of hauling his load up the hill. Occasionally
if nearly pumped out by his previous exertions and
he received a call just as he was about to pick up his
load again, he would tell the ’phone to go to Heaven
and wait till he came up. He might still have been
sending his messages, but one night an angel ap-
peared to him and told him to shoot his three neigh-
bors for poisoning his drinking water; and the
hta removed S ** fuWl the contr act, had
“Silas S.”: Parkinson was a hero, and I
can prove it. He was going home from Coyes, full
of whisky and fine feelings. His track led him
along the bank of the river. At Rule’s landing he
saw It. It was a man in a black suit, wearing an
old-fashioned belltopper hat, floating face down in
the dark waters. Parkinson waited for nothing but
to tear off his pink tie and one shirt cuff before hurl-
ing himself into the river. He grappled with the
drowned or drowning man, and towed him to the
river’s bank; then, having hauled himself and the
waterlogged stranger on to the bank, he dashed
wildly to the east and yelled “Help!” at the lower-
ing bush, after which he dashed wildly to the west,
and yelled “Help!” at the heedless hills. Parkin-
son’s third dash brought him back to the spot re-
cently occupied by the human jetsam. The figure
was gone from the shore, and out in the stream
floated a man in black, wearing a quaint, superfluous
Paris hat. Parkinson tore off his other cuff, hurled
his collar far from him, and dived into the river.
He rescued the perishing once more, dragged him
higher up the bank, rolled a large rock partly on to
him as a tether or stay, and after dashing blindly in
three directions and screaming “Help!” to the un-
heeding waste, headed for Rule’s house. In 15 minutes
he was back, running well ahead of the whole Rule
family. Parkinson dashed to the spot where he had
left the alleged deceased, and halted suddenly. De-
ceased had shifted again. There was no body on the
shore, but far out in the moonlit river floated a
semi-submerged Wesleyan in black garments. “Blowed
if he ain’t gone an’ done it again!” wailed Parkinson.
Parkinson tore off one boot, - flung his cap at the
moon, and took an heroic header into the tide. For
the third time he rescued the sombre citizen, but
this time he landed him on the wrong side of the
river, and while the whole Rule family, numbering
15, was getting out the boat, Parkinson was shout-
irg to the heavens and the hills for help, and holding
the would-be-suicide tight to ten a firma. The Rule
family rushed to his assistance, and found Parkinson
working like a machine, applying the rules for the
restoration of the apparently drowned to the well-
made, grass-stuffed scarecrow from their own orchard.
The apparently eccentric conduct of the scarecrow
was due to the wanton frivolity of a band of young
fishermen camped in the scrub near by. I know for
a fact that Parkinson did not receive the Royal
Humane Society’s medal. The Royal Humane
Society takes no account of good intentions.
* * * *
“Tekelo”: Mrs. Urumangi. of the Solomon
Islands nobility, visited me the other day. Her eight-
moon-old daughter suckled at her breast. Between
draughts the star-eyed infant sucked its mother’s pipe
(loaded with strong Emu twist) in placid content.
Everything was quite ordinary; nobody was sick,
and, thank God, nobody AVowsed.
* * *
“Ess” : On swampy land, or on any flat
country after a spell of rain, the bullfrog band per-
forms melodiously day and night, but is heard to
much better advantage at night. The singers have
a great variety of notes, and seem to follow one
another as though some musical genius had arranged
the symphony. The result (when you are not listen-
ing for horsebells) is pleasant enough. Now and
again they croak together, uttering one rousing blast,
which is followed by a slight pause; then each one
takes up his place again in the corroboree, the deep
bass of the old bullfrog being particularly notice-
able. Nor is the concert confined to one spot; it
is heard all over the flats where water is lying, a
thousand voices muffled by distance mingling softly
with the* strong clear notes of the near performers.
THE ENTHUSIAST.
PASSENGER (to pilot): “Look at that sea!
What a dreadful risk ships take , don't
they!”
If you look in the pools and gilghi-holes vou will
notice huge patches of white froth, and here and
there little discs of white eggs floating in a jelly-like
mass. These are the frogs’ nests. In warm weather
the eggs are soon hatched, and the water becomes
alive with darting and wriggling tadpoles. In this
stage the creatures are more fish than frogs ; but in
a few days they sprout legs, and the tail disappears.
If food is scarce and they are confined in a small
space, they make dinner of one another’s tails. When
the pools are drying up the frog takes in a cargo of
water, and buries himself in the mud, which cakes
over him. There he may remain for many months ;
but as soon as sufficient rain comes to loosen his
prison bars, he leaps forth to wet his whistle and
give it lip.
THE SUNDAY BEER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
M'Canister was going home
At ten o clock on Saturday.
His noble brow was marked with loam,
His air was bibulously gay.
One bottle ’neath his dexter arm
He bore his Sabbath pangs to charm.
M'Canister was shocking drunk
(His Saturdays were often gay).
On nearing home he stumbled plunk
On Higginson, who drove a dray.
A barrel perched upon the car
Held pecks of corporation tar.
Poor Mac, in-toed and bleary-eyed,
Gazed sadly on the mighty keg.
“Oh, you’re the lucky dog,” he sighed.
“Say, howjah do it, mate, I beg?
Here’s me, to damp me Sunday throttle,
Must cart it in a measly bottle!”

YOU Have a
right to demand
that automobiles
warning signals
YOU want to know when an automobile is com-
ing. You want to know in time to get out of
the way.
When a motorist doesn’t warn you of his ap-
proach, he has failed to do his duty to you and
to public safety.
'JokePtiblic Safety Signal”
The Klaxon is the safety signal. You always hear
it. You always hear it in time. No matter how
preoccupied you may be you always hear it. And
its sound conveys to you an expression of danger.
It is a true warning, abrupt, penetrating, pur-
posely unpleasant.
m
No mother need worry
—if the motorist uses a Klaxon
CHILDREN hear the Klaxon’s
sharp blast—no matter how ab"
sorbed they are in their play. They
can’t mistake its sound for any
other sound in the street. Instinct-
ively they run to safety.

The Employment of Prison Labor.
“Notbell” for the defence: —
“Lex’' (B. 11/12/’l3) arraigns the Holman Gov-
ernment’s scheme of afforestation by prison labor;
and I am for the accused. It is freely admitted that
N.S.W., like the rest of Australia, needs tree-plant-
ing very badly. Also, it is extremely improbable
that any Government, whether Lib. or Lab., would
devote large sums to such a project, which
could show no return in money for 50 years or so.
Therefore, it seems a reasonable proposition to em-
ploy the cheap prison labor available for this pur-
pose, more especially as there is a very decided and
very natural objection to prisoners competing with
free labor in ordinary industrial enterprises.
“Lex” says the scheme is devised to give N.S.W.
prisoners as good a time as possible, and he is
troubled because the plan may somewhat ameliorate
the hard conditions of their punishment. But it may
be that its promoters have broader and more humane
views. It is an echo of the bad old system to say
that once the evildoer is in the clutches of the Law
he should pay the penalty in blood and tears. Mod-
ern methods aim at reformation first. If the trans-
gressor is to be of any use to the community after
his sentence is over, surely we should try to make a
better man of him while he is in gaol, instead of
damning him, body and soul, as is the custom where
ignorance, stupidity or brutality holds the reins..
But “Lex” has another objection to tree-planting:
“The gathering together, for months and years at a
time, of a number of unmarried men, or men whose
wives are necessarily separated from them, is a- si 7 ;®"
able enough menace to morality in itself.” But will
the menace be less if these men, marrkd or un-
married, are undergoing “separate treatment,” cooped
up alone in little stone cells and shut off from
fresh air and sunshine? “Lex” approves of “separate
treatment,” but does solitary confinement necessarily
improve the morals of sinful man ? Seventy years
ago Charles Dickens said of it: “I am convinced
that there is a depth of terrible endurance in it which
none but the sufferers themselves can fathom, and
which no man has a right to inflict on his fellow
creature. I hold this slow and daily tampering with
the mysteries of the human brain to be immeasur-
ably worse than any torture of body; and because
its ghastly signs and tokens are not so palpable to
the eye and sense of touch as scars upon the flesh,
because its wounds are not upon the surface, and it
extorts few cries that human ears can hear, I the
more denounce it.” A healthy, outdoor life, com-
bined with association under sensible supervision,
seems to be, “Lex” notwithstanding, a much more
promising method of moral and physical reform
than the sedentary gaol occupations, and the torture
of separate treatment which “Lex” advocates.
“Lex” further asserts that “the existing prison sys-
tem of N.S.W. is admittedly one of the best, if not
the best, in the world.” Who says that? Who admits
it? And even if it is good, can we learn nothing?
Have we, and we alone, reached the height of per-
fection ?
Says “Lex”: “They [the prisoners] learn useful
trades; the regular hours and exercise and the
absence of beer set them up in health.” Surely their
health would not be likely to be any the worse if
they lived in a tree-planting camp away on the
mountain side! Does that sound any less salubrious
than the aioomy confines of Darlinghurst or Parra-
matta? And does the prisoner in those horror-
haunted institutions ever learn a useful trade? “Fully
20 trades are taught in the gaols,” says “Lex.”
According to the latest Prisons report they keep
blacksmiths', painters’, tinsmiths’, carpenters’ and
other shops going for the necessary work of the
prison, and there are other shops, as mat-makers’,
tailors’, saddlers’ and bootmakers’, where work is
done tor the gaols and other Government depart-
ments. But it is more than doubtful whether the
prisoner learns enough of any trade to enable him
to earn a crust on his release. By far the greatest
number of prisoner-tradesmen are employed at tailor-
ing and bootmaking; but is it reasonable to expect
that a “tailor” who has been making rough prison
shirts or trousers for years, or a bootmaker who
has learned how to fashion a pair °* ol “® sy
shoes, could compete on equal terms with the skilled
tradesmen of the outside factories? In the report
referred to, the Director of Prison Labor observes.
“One of the great difficulties which a prison-taught
tradesman has to contend with, if he endeavors to
continue his trade outside, is that he is a slow work-
man compared with the free tradesman. So much
for the present system of “teaching prisoners trades.
The tree-planting is bound to be done badly, UEX
thinks, because “it is no game for the mexpen-
enced, being really a branch of agriculture. It is
more difficult, then, to teach a prisoner how to plant
a tree than it is to teach him the bookbinding or
bootmaking that “Lex” prefers! And from another
point of view, surely a knowledge of agriculture,
however slight, is a more useful asset to the dis-
charged prisoner in Australia than the ability to
patch a battered hall-mat or crudely half-sole a pair
° f Finally, tlie afforestation scheme “has been a
failure, economically and otherwise, in Maonland,
says “Lex." Well, it has stood for 15 years; and
“Lex" may remember that the persistence of a
scheme for 15 years—in the case of the N.b.W.
prison system—was accepted as evidence, not oi
failure, but of success.
The appalling Vic. honorarium is saved
from his own dunderheadedness at times.
The other day several Brunswick (Vic.)
fruiterers were proved to have sold cherries
which were described as “simply rotten,
“decaved into pulp” and “emitting an awful
smell,” whereupon three amateur beaks mur-
mured “Fined 10s.” But the prosecuting
inspector pointed out that the minimum pen-
alty was £5, and the shocked trio had to
impose it. People who know the law are a
great trial to the amateur beak.
“Bobstay”: The International Life Sav-
ing Conference is to recommend to the
nations represented that foreign-going steam-
ships should be required to carry life-boat
equipment for only 75 per cent, of the
people on board, the remaining 25 per cent,
to be provided for by life-rafts, of the re-
versible pontoon pattern. ’Twas ever thus.
After the first gasp of horror at the Titanic
disaster the Board of Trade hurriedly de-
cided that life-boats to carry all on board,
or the complement as per schedule, must
be provided. Now that the great tragedy
is no longer a nine days’ horror the good
intentions may go to the usual place. There
is by no means a unanimous opinion as to
the efficacy of the life-raft. True, the con-
trivance can’t sink, and it is more likely to
be launched in time of trouble without
smashing into matchwood than a life-boat,
and once afloat it is more roomy; but it has
the great disadvantage that it can move only
at the will of the wind and waves. It is
expected, of course, that the boats will tow
the rafts, but this is not infrequently im-
practicable. Whatever is finally decided
upon Australia must accept, and, that being
so, the best of representation should have
been provided. As it was, Captain Collins,
of the High Commissioner’s office, was the
Commonwealth’s delegate ; and he is a mili-
tary officer who knows all about the sea
from the smoking-room of a mail-boat.
“Sapphire”: The Australian Naval Col-
lege, at Geelong, which selects its youngsters
before they are 14, undertakes to finish oil
their general education, besides giving them
a technical training for their chosen profes-
sion. Is it an oversight that in the history
course no mention of Australia appears.
Some reputedly well-informed people appear
to believe that this land does possess a his-
tory, pocket-edition certainly, but fairly in-
teresting, and for us more important than
any other literature in the world. In fact,
the youngsters in the public primary and
secondary schools have to “swot’ at it, and
it is included in the Arts course at the Uni.
But the young naval officer of the future is
to remain ignorant of the story of the land
that has trained him, employs him, and is
supposed to inspire him; and how he can be
expected to successfully lead men of Aus-
tralia into action in such circumstances is
one of the things I don’t understand.
From a much-travelled “Battler” :
Australia has held disillusionment out to me with
both hands. 1 read of your fine manly democratic
spirit, yet never in any white mans country have.l
met so much crawling and toadying. X hit a job m
a little country store, with an Australian for my mate.
1-Ie told me to drop calling the man who paid me
my wages “Mister,*’ as he said it sounded too like
deference, but I noticed that every time the boss
came into the shop this stalwart flew all round
like a fly in a bottle to create an impression that he
liked work. Another disappointment is with regard
to the Army. Wherever else I have been the young
fellows took a pride in their soldiering, and when 1
saw the first line of Australia’s defence slouching
along like a flock of sheep, with a worried-looking
officer walking behind with a face expressing a stand-
ing apology, I gasped. The Bulletin s remarks
about the possibility of Jap invasion and the need of
protection come nearer the cold, hard truth than
the majority of untravelled Australians seem to
imagine, and such a mob would just be sport for
our yellow friends. I’ve seen the Jap and now Ive
seen the Australian; and at present all my money
would go on to the former if it came to a scrap,
with no navy or seasoned troops to help. A Jap
or an Indian can be as good a soldier as a pampeied
white, and it’s up to our side to shape better and take
the business far more seriously than it is doing so
far. I’ve served in several regiments and I know
a bit about the game, so this is not all arm-chair
twaddle, as my instructor’s certificates could prove.
Anyhow, I’m going to do my modest duty to the
country I live in now, and offer myself as a volun-
teer officer, if they will take me. It’s no use
merely grumbling; even your “Alligator’ Johnson
couldn’t kill an Asiatic invader with a speech.
“McNorth”; Now that both Poles have
been visited and any doubts as to their
whereabouts laid at rest, and it has been
definitely proved that they shift 3ft. in 75,684
years (figures quoted from memory) and that
the adjacent country is even more desolate
than the Federal Capital site and will never
be worth tuppence as a tourist resort or any-
thing else, isn’t Polar exploration about due
for the count-out? Yet news comes of fur-
ther proposed expenditure of life and money
in alleged exploration. What for? The
ends of the Earth are unquestionably
the most barren and valueless places in
existence. They have no mining or agri-
cultural future; the man who would
sink through 50ft. of ice before he
struck the ground would simply fritter
away his time ; while the cocky who rose in
the morning to find an iceberg on top of his
pumpkin patch would at once talk wildly
of taking his capital out of the country. He
would also have labor troubles, for the hired
man would refuse to work from sunrise to
sunset in a country where the day lasted
six months. Why not give the useless ends
of the Earth a spell and have a go at the
middle’ Australia and Papua have any
amount of country which offers a greater
return for exploration— country of which
we know very little, more than we do o the
Poles, yet much of it immensely fruitful be
yond a doubt. To get the human and other
treasure spent on the ends diverted to the
middle we must knock the halo oft the i olai
explorer; we must, the Poles having heen
duly found, take the men who henceforth
want to star as Polar heroes and put
them in their proper place among those use-
less freaks who bang pianos for 97 hours
or twirl Indian clubs for 17 days llsec. on
end. Then the foolish game will tail down
dead.
From London: —
How would you relish going to sea with a Captain
Sinker! It is the name of the commander of the
Southern Cross, the steamer that carts the Anglican
Bishop of Melanesia from one group of Pacific islands
to another. In spite of his depressing name, the
Captain has been making a breezy speech at a mis-
sionary meeting in London, starting off by saying
that, though he had been twice shipwrecked, once
frizzled in a burning vessel, twice ice-bound and .once
captured by head-hunters, he never was so fright-
ened as he was at the moment when called upon
to make his first speech to John Bull and his
missus.
“Pontius Potter’s” contribution to the
Tasmanian-corpse symposium:
This talk of Hobart tombstones recalls a man who
does not grow a slab on his grave. Wainewright
(you can spell it without the “e” if you like), poet,
painter and expert poisoner, is buried in the convict
section of the Trinity burying ground in Park-street.
After a term at Port Arthur he spent his latter end
as an assigned servant at the Hobart General Hospi-
tal. The resident surgeon, Dr. Bedford, had a small
studio fitted up, and employed Wainewright to make
sketches of interesting operations, etc. _ Fate played
into the poisoner’s hands once by admitting to the
hospital an official from Port Arthur. , He was in
a dying state, and the attendant was instructed to
make the passing-out as comfortable as possible.
Wainewright recognised his old enemy, and the
dying man’s last hours were just about as nice as a
devil with an artistic temperament could make them.
Wainewright has been woven into a good deal of
fiction. Dickens made a short story out of him
which brought the author £lOOO from an American
paper. On the whole, the money was well worth the
story.
“Green Tape” on a gamble:—
W. H. Whiddon’s appointment as N.S.W. Income
Tax Commissioner came as a surprise packet to the
tipsters, who thought they could pick it in two. A
few months ago Whiddon was third in the Depart-
ment. Then Cantry, the secretary, was taken seri-
ously ill, and Whiddon was made acting-secretary.
Next Spiller paid the last tax, and thus Whiddon
suddenly finds himself head of the Department. He
joined as a temporary clerk in 1895, and was made
a permanent hand no more than eight years ago.
His rapid rise has been helped by the vagaries of
successive Governments in changing the incidence
and method of tax-gathering, with consequent ups
and downs in the Department’s importance. But
though these changes favored Whiddon by clearing
out the men in front of him, his last promotion
came as a surprise; it was actually made before his
second-last promotion was gazetted.

A British combine, representing a capital of
£35,000,000, and headed by Lever Brothers, has been
formed with the object of manufacturing soap in
China. — Cable.
The Yankee Meat Octopus, having laid
its plans in Australia, is now sizing-up
Maoriland. Its agent is at present in the
Ricketty Isles surveying the prospect on
behalf of Armours, who are one of the
Trust’s big tentacles.
Joe Cook, speaking from the dolce far
niente of recess, remarked that the only
way to make the position of affairs in the
Federal Parliament satisfactory is to appeal
to the country. Well?
Joe Cook, prostrating himself before the
almighty bagpipes at the Sydney Highland
gathering on New Year’s Day, generously
gave Scotland, all the credit for showing the
early Joe Cook how to build up his char-
acter and become a better Joe Cook than
ever. And Scotland, gazing on the com-
pleted Joe Cook, cheered him to the echo or
.thereabouts. Plow these national festivals
do bring out the latent modesty in people!
Carr and Catts, two N. S. Wales Labor
members in the Federal Parliament, put up
the record for least attendances last session
—24 and 26 respectively. When these
figures are compared with Bruce Smith’s 65,
it is not to be wondered at that Tory Joe
Cook’s majority of one was sufficient. Had
every Laborite attended 90 per cent, of the
sittings—surely not an impossibility—Cook’s
slender majority would have been worried
into its yawning grave long ago.
The most cogent defence speech made on
the breaking-up day of the Fed. House was
bv Higgs, who hates defence. Higgs
was saying that the Boers could shoot any
head that peeped out from a rock. Piggot,
of Calare, interjected: “They did not shoot
you!” A few more “words” followed ; then
Pliggs, imploringly, to the chairman, “Will
you _ protect me, sir?” There comes always
a time, too, when the country which for
some reason or other (often because it has
too many Higgses) can’t defend itself, ap-
peals to the nearest kind gentleman: “Will
you protect me, sir?” And the kind gentle-
man generally does it by making a meal of
the defenceless suppliant.
The N.S.W. second ballots recalled one
phase of the old electoral system. Prior to
the Act of 1892 the elections used to start
in Sydney and straggle through the country
for three weeks or a month. Whichever
party won in Sydney had a pretty good
chance of getting good wins in the country.
Moreover, candidates who lost their seats in
Sydney could fight for a fresh lease of life
in the backblocks. Thus Parkes and Robert-
son, when beaten in Sydney, both got in for
country seats. O’Sullivan, beaten in South
Sydney, went straight to Queanbeyan and
was triumphantly returned for the first time.
Parkes declared that “the door of his political
life was closed for ever” when East Sydney
would not have him ; but a back door in the
country was promptly opened, and he
slipped in quietly on his stockinged feet.
“F.H.”: The newest Victorian Ministry
is taking as few chances as possible in con-
nection with the by-elections on the 15th
inst. Prahran is one of the two metro-
politan seats to be contested. At the last
general election, Prahran had three polling-
booths —one at South Yarra, handy to the
northern and more prosperous portion of
the electorate; one at Prahran town hall, in
the middle of the Prahran division; the
third at Windsor, where there is a packed
area of wage-earners. Windsor was the
only booth which showed a majority for
Labor. This time there is to be no booth
at Windsor, and the fagged toiler will have
to walk a long step to the town hall to re-
cord his vote. Liberalism, of course, will
see to it that the Windsor Liberals don’t
have to do any walking.
“Hair Space,” from alongside a Victorian
ditch:—
Lots of farmers in the northern irrigation area of
Victoria are being converted into good Unificationists
by the divided control of the Murray waters. The
Watt Government, in pursuance of its irrigation
policy, is anxious to construct a weir at Torrumberry,
which would render possible the irrigation of a large
and promising area; but South Aus. objects. The
latter State is anxious in its turn to push on with
the Queen Victoria works on its part of the river;
but Willie Watt, by way of retaliation for the
South Australian embargo on his weir, announces
his repugnance to the South Australian improvements.
The net result is that both matters are hung up.
and the public in both States suffers. Exactly what
would happen if Willie went ahead and built his weir
and disregarded South Australia’s frenzied protests,
no one seems to know ; but the prospect of the Watt
Government doing anything definite is not hopeful.
Meanwhile many good Liberal cockies are beginning
to ask why the Commonwealth doesn’t take over the
river; and if the whole sacred Constitution had to
go into the melting-pot to allow it to be done, they
would cheerfully lend a hand to put it there.
“Patty” Glynn goes off on behalf of the
Commonwealth to talk with Sir Edward
Grey about the New Hebrides. Penny
? stamps should do nearly all this business;
: otherwise, as an intermediary, McMahon
Glynn is the best man at the disposal of the
Cook party. New Hebrides may become a
big question; to the minds of many they
must become strategic islands. Australia is
therefore right in getting a foot in while
the door is ajar. Glynn doesn’t know every-
thing about what Australia wants, but,
taking him all round, he is an Australian
of good stamp. He has been in these parts
since 1880 and a politician off and on since
3887. His merit in debate is that he tries
to understand his subject before he gets up
to discuss it. He was born in the potato
blight ”f nearly 60 years ago, in the har-
rowed province of Munster, and still carries
with hi. i a brogue which fully supports the
name of Patrick McMahon Glynn on his
visiting card.
Hugh Mahon’s return unopposed for
Labor’s Westralian pocket borough, Ival-
goorlie, was partly an accident, but mostly
the result of his opponents’ tactics before
the selection ballot. Mahon is not person-
ally popular in the State, else Gregory had
not beaten him at last election. But the
friends of his opponents (Green, ex-State
member, and Union secretary Glance) so
bludgeoned one another that ordinary union
men were lost in bewilderment and ugly
thoughts; and in their bewilderment they
dropped both local men, and chose the cold
outsider.

THE MECHANICAL TOY.
Members of the Royal family kept strictly to the religious spirit of the day. The Queen’s gifts in-
cluded new dresses for the servants. The King’s gifts included mechanical toys for his younger children.
Cable.
The Port of London Authority lately
called for tenders for lock-gates, bridges and
other ironmongery for the Albert and Royal
Albert docks. German and British firms
competed, and the Protectionist foreigners
underbid their Preetrade rivals by £170,000,
or 26 per cent., and, of course, got the con-
tracts. Meantime, some people reckon that
Germany is building battleships to conquer
Britain. Maybe. But it looks superfluous.
As soon as the constitutionally-nasty Joe
Cook had got safely into recess he said that
his Government had come through “without
any of those adventitious aids by which cer-
tain people elsewhere in the Commonwealth
have kept themselves afloat —I mean we
have had no Willis to fall back upon.”
Which was quite true; but they had a John-
son, who fired Josiah Thomas out of the
House for making a courteous statement
that the Opposition had lost confidence in
Johnson; and they also had a Cook who,
while himself throwing insults at Johnson,
was so bent on protecting Johnson from in-
sults that he had McGrath fired out for tell-
ing his constituents what he thought of
Johnson. Let the Government thank its
stars that it didn’t have the “adventitious
aid of a Willis.” For its purposes a Cook
and a Johnson are far safer and a lot more
useful.
Lloyd George in a sort of Christmas
carol: —
He despised success unless a real effort was to be
made to reduce the overwhelming extravagance and
expenditure on armaments. If a saving were effected
it would be possible to sweep away the tea, sugar,
coffee and cocoa taxes....
As the day of a Labor Ministry at West-
minster draws nearer, the greater becomes
the necessity for Australia to look entirely
to itself for defence. While the Liberals or
Conservatives are in power, they may be
relied upon to make an effort, should Aus-
tralia be attacked, to save their invest-
ments, no matter what further hardships
might fall upon the shoulders of the
struggling masses in Britain. But when
Labor gets a clear majority in the House
of Commons, its first concern —and duty—
will be to see that the working-man and his
wife and his children are properly paid,
housed, clothed, fed and entertained. When
all that has been properly attended to, it
may look round to see what has become of
“the Empire.”
Labor-man George Jones, beaten for the
Inverell seat in the recent N.S.W. elections
was one of the victims of State Frights.’
Ihe State members, distracted by the atti-
tude of Holman, McGowen and Beeby, when
called upon to support the first referendum
came more or less slowly—save a few all-
wool Federalists, like George Black. George
Jones didn’t come at all; so the big-Aus-
tralian A.W.U. men waited for him in his
district. They didn’t support the Liberal •
they simply killed George Jones by inertia’
Those bushmen, though they may not talk
much, have long memories.
Though it has so
badly neglected the
development of out-
ports, the N.S.W.
Labor Government has
at least broken
through in one place.
The old Sydney bri-
gade would never lis-
ten to border railway
propositions that
might feed Melbourne,
preferring to leave the
N.S.W. farmer with-
out transport and
markets; but the
Holman and Watt
Governments have
agreed on the exten-
sion of Victorian lines
into N. S. Wales at
Euston, Wentworth
and Moama, and of a
N. S. Wales line from
Nimitybelle through
Bombala and Delegate
into GippsJand. This
is all excellent as far
as it goes; though it
is a shrieking absurd-
ity that the traffic of
Gippsland should be
dragged past Twofold
Bay and Jervis Bay
to Sydney.
During last Westralian Parliamentary
session, the landlords’ House rejected no
less than 16 of the Bills passed by the
people’s. House. The Opposition leader
chortles over this and says it points to the
immoderation of Scaddan’s demands. What
it really does point to is the dreadful fact
that, in an allegedly democratic country,
with over 152,000 electors, less than 10,000
'propertied, electors return a majority of the
members of a Second Chamber which has
the power to veto the measures passed by
the popular Assembly.
Fitzpatrick, the clattering tinpot of the
Liberal band in N. S. Wales Assembly,
started his noise in the new Parliament by
complaining that Treasury officials had the
effrontery to pay him £34 by cheque on
December 23 (his salary as M.L.A. from
December 6to December 31). His grievance
was, not that he had been paid in advance,
but that the Treasury hadn’t paid the
money into his bank. (Bank unnamed.)
The luck is to the impudent these days.
The person who had the real grievance was
the taxpayer, who witnessed Fitzpatrick
grabbing (in advance) £34 for practically
one day’s work, knowing that the bird
wasn’t to be recalled to its perch until Par-
liament reassembled at some vague date in
the uncertain future.
A Melb. Age writer, talking vaguely of
the “gang of schemers” who are alleged to be
doing the dirtiest things on the Victorian
turf with absolute impunity, says:—
The bookmakers know the gang, and hate it like
a plague. Many of them are deeply in debt to
members of the gang. The bigger racing stables
dread the gang, but are often obliged to “work in”
with it in order to avoid disaster. On the other
hand, many small stables are compelled to propitiate
the schemers in order to live. .. .In a former day
the public used to be exploited by the Ring. To-day
the bookmaker and the public are both being ex-
ploited by these schemers.
This is putting the case from an angry
Ikey point of view. The bookmakers seem-
ingly live as expensively as ever; hence all
the means to carry on the business of being
“exploited” by the gang must come out of
the pockets of the backers, who lose, lose,
lose. So the public is more outrageously
victimised than ever, and there is more
reason than ever why the Tote should be
legalised. No gang can exploit the Tote.

BAD HEADACHES.
ALMOST IMMEDIATE RELIEF OB-
TAINED BY TAKING DR. MORSE’S
INDIAN ROOT PILLS. CROW’S NEST
LADY’S PRAISE.
“I took Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills in
Melbourne, on the recommendation of a
friend, for the relief of habitual constipa-
tion,” writes Mrs. Lillie Pearce, of Lane
Cove Road, Crow’s Nest, North Sydney, “and
found them do much good, almost immedi-
ately relieving me from the dreadful head-
aches, etc., and I am now never without
them in my home. I have also found them
a very useful medicine with some of my
children, as I am the mother of five. I
frequently recommend Dr. Morse’s Indian
Root Pills to my friends. You can use this,
if useful, in hopes of assisting others to re-
lief.” Thousands of people in all parts of
Australia and the world will confirm Mrs.
Pearce’s statement. Dr. Morse’s Indian Root
Pills are the ideal family remedy for the
little ills of life.*
SPORTING
NOTIONS
Artesian, in winning the Perth Cup a
second time, belittles the form of the best Westralian
racers. Artesian’s first capture of the Perth Cup was
in December, 1911. Next year he came to Melbourne
for the big Spring meetings, and was somewhat
fancied for Melb. Cup with only Bst. up. He finished
twelfth. Apparently the Westralian crack was no
stayer in such company. Last week he carried 9st.
71b., and won the two-mile race in 3min. 33 l-ssec.
* * * *
“0.K.”; A more or less indirect result
of the Blackpool case was the resignation last week
of one of the V.R.C. stipendiary stewards. Mr. S.
Griffiths, the “stipe” in question, found his job
“uncongenial and unsatisfactory,” he says, quite
apart from the protracted unpleasantness incidental
to the disqualification of Blackpool a year ago. It
was unlucky for the “stipes” that they started their
professional career by making a bloomer in the case
of a gee whose owner could afford to fight and fight
for further inquiry. Also it was more unlucky for
the owner of Blackpool that the “stipes” were then
on their trial, so to speak, and the V.R.C. rulers
naturally did not want the new tribunal to have its
first decision upset. Everything happened for the
worst. Owing to the Blackpool mistake, and the
pertinacity of Frank Meyers in forcing the V.R.C.
committee to practically admit the error, the early
zeal of the poor “stipes” has become paralysed.
Having caused a lot of trouble by doing one wrong
at the first meeting they attended, the unlucky trio
seemed afraid to do the right thing at subsequent
meetings. So they did simply nothing to speak of,
and called it “uncongenial” work.
“Hermes”: The resignation of V.R.C.
stipendiary-steward Griffiths has caused a hullabaloo.
Griffiths says he found his position “uncongenial and
unsatisfactory.” Why? For a long time the atmo-
sphere of Vic. racing has been filled with rumors.
The largest and most persistent is to the effect that
there is “a gang” which exploits bookmakers, horse-
owners and public. In the old days the Ring ex-
ploited the public; now a “gang” is said to exploit
the Ring. This “gang” is alleged to have so many
jockeys in its grip that it can practically fix the
result of any race. It is even said that many big
bookmakers are heavily in debt to the members of
the mysterious combination. It is also alleged to
have got control of the judgment of sundry handi-
canr>ers. When a market has been made, and the
public steered on to certain gee-gees, its agents
quietly back the certainty, and when the numbers
are up Joseph O’Cohen and the gang cut up the
money collected from the public. It is a tall storv,
but there is something in it, though whether it had
anything to do with Griffiths’s retirement is quite
another matter.
* * * *
Punters at Flemington received a New
Year’s warning against the error of their ways. The
two first-favorites that got home were not very widely
backed, whilst the winners of the two principal events
Standish Plate and Bagot Handicap—were rank
outsiders. Captain White, generally regarded as a
has-been, reasserted himself by winning the Standish
flutter in fair time, with 9st. 51b. up; and St. Vano,
lightly weighted, led the field all the way in the
Bagot.
Three sons of Flavus were victorious on
New Year’s Day. Alured took the valuable Tatt.’s
Club Cup at Randwiek, and Captain White and Re-
caller won races at Flemington.
» * * •
The second day of Tatt.’s Meeting at
Randwiek (Sydney) was a more pleasant outing for
punters than the first, as in four of the six races the
first or second favorites got home, causing Michael
McNoses to wear a disappointed expression as he made
for his buzz-cart. In the Novice Handicap the public
swag went on Sound Asleep (what a name!) at 6 to
4 on. In the Flying Welter First Principle was prime
favorite at 9 to 4 against; but there was a fair
demand for Maltchester at sixes, and he got home
by a head. The New Year’s Gift proved to be a
correctly-named event, as Popinjay (7 to 2 against)
was well loaded with the gold of Demos, as were also
Gigandra and Border King (9 to 2 against). Golden
Hop had a good following at sixes. Popinjay just
managed to beat Golden Hop by a head. The big
event of the day, Tatt.’s Cup, made glorious with
1500 added sovereigns, rather redeemed McNoses’s
sinking fortunes, as the public made Coradil favorite
at threes, and took Limelight as a saver at fours.
Those who backed Alured, the winner, were lucky
enough to get eights. Still the public fancy was not
far out, for Coradil ran into second place, with Lime-
light third. The Nursery Handicap also ended in
favor of the bag. Mountain Knight, the winner, going
out at sixes, while Indiscretion starred at 5 to 2
against, and the second favorite, Secret Service, which
was also second finisher, got away at 9 to 2 against.
But the punter came back with a biff in the Welter,
and recovered some of his own by backing Crosska
at 6 to 4 against. Crosska landed the boodle by half
a length.
The Tote did things again at Adelaide on
New Year’s Day. In the Maiden Plate Bob Soult,
second home, paid £6 9s. In the New Year’s Gift
Master Maelgwyn, the one that arrived behind the
winner, was worth £5 Bs. In the St. Leonards
Handicap Robona handed £123 7s. to backers, and
the second was worth £2 165.; and in the final, the
Marino Handicap, First Shot, the winner, paid £l4,
and the second, Lontar, £4. Once again, has any-
one ever known Judas Skinnem lay odds like these
on placed geegees?
S.A. Jockey Club’s stipendiary stewards
(Hogan, Tom Wigley and Clem Hill) got to work
for the first time on New Year’s Day at Morphett-
ville. They swept up all kinds of things demanding
criticism, from late scratching or late starting to
looking back in a race, the careless tying of a ban-
dage and torn jockey’s “colors.” Hawker’s Tadanga
only just won the weight-for-age; her old rival,
Puringa, had been shot the same day, after an injury
received in racing the weA before.
The sporting event of the week in Sydney
was the visit of the American baseballers. First of
all the Chicago White Sox hurled itself upon a
N.S.W. team and stamped it flat by 10 to one.
Probably it would have been worse than that if some
Americans had not played with the local team. Still,
Australia made a better show at baseball than
Yankeeland did at football, or even cricket. But
the event of the day was the match between the
White Sox of Chicago and the New York Giants.
It was a terrific struggle, and when AVhite Sox entered
on the last phase the side required one to tie and
two to win. It got the two and won by five to four.
On Monday it repeated the operation, and rubbed it
in, the Giants being overthrown by 10 to five. The
American play is indeed wonderful. These fellows
probably know nothing else, but at baseball they are
past masters. Their work absolutely glitters, and is
the apotheosis of professionalism. Reg Baker enter-
tained the teams at a dinner at the Hotel Australia
afterwards, and then drove the men to the Stadium
in motors, while The Maeinsplosh entertained the
ladies, by deputy, at the Tivoli. It was a great
night.
* * * *
The N.S.W. Swimming Championships at
Domain Baths on Saturday provided an excit-
mg finish in the 100yds., although the Half-mile was
a regular walk-over. In the 100yds. Longworth, the
holder, found himself up against Barry and five other
devils almost like unto himself. A fearful struggle
took place, at the sight of which the crowd went
mad especially when, at the finish, Barry, Long-
worth and Solomons literally hurled themselves in a
bunch at the tape. But Barry hurled with the most
ioice, and left the other two behind, dead-heaters for
second place. In the 880yds. Barry did not com-
pete, neither did Solomons. Longworth went to the
front, and kept going further and further in that
direction till he had won by 20 yds.
* * * *
This season’s Sheffield Shield turmoil has
a delightful halo of evenness encircling it. N.S.W.,
Vic. and S. Aus. have jumped on each other once,
with N.S.W. in slightly better position on averages—
thanks to its walloping of Vic. with an innings to
spare. South Aus., however, is bringing Clem Hill
and W. J. Whitty into the fighting line for both
matches at Adelaide—an effort intended, probably, to
frighten visitors when they get on the Wheatfielders’
patch.
South Aus. earned all the glory surround-
ing its defeat of N.S.W. Early in the game it
looked an odds-on chance for Ma. The Croweaters
were 26 behind on the first innings, and left N.S.W.
only 265 to get at the second attempt. But the
splendid fielding of South Aus., backed by the
bowling of Crawford (5 for 71), crumpled the
N.S.W. team right up. The effort was one of the
finest put up by South Aus. for a long time, and
showed that Clem Hill is far from indispensable to
his State. The team is almost one of colts, and
proves that the Wheat State (which, by the way,
doesn’t now produce half as much wheat as N.S.W.)
has plenty of gopd young blood waiting for an oppor-
tunity to justify itself. Mayne’s only veterans were him-
self and Crawford, while Trumper controlled a first-
class team which included four other “players”
besides himself (Massie, Bardsley, Macartney' and
Kelleway), who could not well be left out of an
Australian XI. Yet the colts outplayed the veterans.
THE SHATTERED IDOL.
A one-act tragedy. (First performance, Hew
York; second , Sydney Stadium.) Australia’s
champion, Dave Smith, outed in two minutes
by American Eddie McGoorly.
If the slump keeps up, the N.S.W. Cricket
Association will have to look round for a vaudeville
troupe to help things out. The match against
South Aus. returned barely £5OO, or about £250
less than last year’s fixture; and the two-days’ outing
with Maoriland was very poorly patronised. In the
midst of this decay the country associations are
yelling for financial support; and the Association
is beginning to wander round with, straws in its
headgear.
Charlie Gore, one of Maoriland’s most
popular ex-cricketers, was caught by Death, off
Pneumonia, at Wellington, recently. He played for
his club, his province and his State from about
1890 to 1907, and was one of the most stylish bats-
men, brilliant fieldsmen and true sports that wore
the colors of any of them. He was only 42 when
his score was totalled.
At Christchurch (M.L.) the other day
there was a cricket match between the Railway
men and the Hotel employees. The ticket-snippers
piled up 129 in a very short time. Then the beer-
pump hands went to the sticks, and the Railway
put Beere on to bowl. And Beere, having the usual
demoralising effect, bagged 7 for 19.
When the N.S.W. and Vic. Xl’s faced
one another at Melbourne on New Year’s afternoon
the conditions were perfect, so N.S.W., having won
the toss, went to the wood and proceeded to do
some solid scoring. Collins, 73; Cody, 68; Bards-
ley, n. 0., 81; and Kelleway, 47, were the chief
actors m the raising of the Ma State score to 285
for six wickets. On Friday the score was lifted to
409, Bardsley being the not-out man with 124.
Macartney, though suffering from gastritis, played
and got a very respectable 53. Ryder took the bowl-
ing honors with five wickets for 138 runs. He was
well supported by Armstrong, whose three wickets
cost only 62 runs. The Victorian first innings was
ghastly, no less than four men (one absent) failing
to score at all. Armstrong headed the list with
34, Matthews was run out at 27, Carroll fell for 26
and Park went down for 25. Sundries did bril-
liantly for 17. The bowling laurels were well
divided, Massie taking three for 59, Kelleway three
for 15, and old, reliable Folkard two for 12. Vic-
toria followed on, and by night had lost two
wickets for three runs, including one sundry. On
Saturday the rot continued, in spite of a splendid
stand by Baring, who whacked 122. The only other
double figures were the 25 of Carroll, the 27 of
Matthews and the 10 of Sundries. Two men failed
to score and the side vanished for 199, leaving Ma
on top by an innings and 59 runs. The Victorians
were unlucky to this extent—two of their players
were practically disabled.
Tom Garrett, Ma’s first Public Trustee,
was a member of the pioneer Australian XI to visit
England in 1878, and was also in the teams of 1882
and 1886. lie was one of the most successful bowlers
who ever represented Australia in England. His
average in 1878 was 10.30 per wicket. Cricket 36
years ago was different from the game to-day, but
Garrett s figures were only once beaten—by Spof-
forth, the demon,” who completed the tour of 1880
with an average of 8.28.

“Stumps”: N. S. Wales Cricket Ass. has
decreed that the competition for the premiership
shall continue during the absence of the State rep.
team. the obvious result is that the clubs which
supply the cream of their players to the State eleven
are penalised. This may add to the uncertainty of
the final result, but it can’t be considered fair to the
affected clubs. University without their Massie
could not get the weak Middle Harbor team out on
Saturday, and this might cost ’Varsity the premier-
ship. Of course, it may be shown that Glebe with
four players in Melbourne trounced Balmain by bat-
U P i* 3 * n ', ns . for 7 wickets; but Balmain was
without Folkard, its only good bowler, so the cause
explains the result, as usual.
* * * *
harto”: Here, are we getting slack?
Anyway how many records do we hold now—other
than fool records? The laurels for cricket, boxing,
tennis and sculling*, have all been taken from us. But
the record for continuous ball-punching is still ours.
Beginning at some hour on Monday night of Decem-
bei 22 at Albury (N.S.W.), one Barrie continually
punched the inflated bag till the same hour on the
following Wednesday, thus adding 180 min. to the
previous world’s record of 45 hours for this branch
of lunacy. And he did it, too, at a time when he
might have been well employed punching out bush-
fares with a green bush. If anyone smashes this
record I hope it won t be an Australian.
Amongst arrivals by the Morea, which
reached Fremantle on the 30th, is Barney Thompson,
the sole surviving member of the Joe Thompson
brotherhood, so well known in the Australian betting
ring m # the years that are behind.
A. London paper has published some weird
details of the betting mania in the North of England.
One man challenged “All Yorkshire” to a matchbox-
throwing competition, and staked £lO in earnest of
his claim to unrivalled skill. Brick-carrying is a
better-known outlet for the gambling spirit. Profes-
sionals in that line of art practise for hours every
evenmg. The artist takes a brick of a certain weight
and thickness between his thumb and forefinger and
walks till it drops. Or he remains stationary and
holds the brick against the clock. It is a ridiculous
sport ; nevertheless a brick-gripping match between
a workingman expert and an athlete of the Sandow
cult would be interesting. Feats of finger-strength
111 „ the . Physical culture curriculum. Clarence
Weber, for instance, can tear three packs of playing
cards with his fingers. Would he be a champion at
holding a cube of baked clay between forefinger and
thumb ?

Of 64 who started from Sydney in the
motor-cycle reliability contest, only 23 reached the
Melbourne G.P.O. without disaster of some sort.
was the first to strike trouble, his machine
skidding soon after starting, and throwing him against
a tram. He lost half an ear, but rode on, after
sternly rebuking a John Hop who wanted to take
him to the hospital. Between Gundagai and Ger-
manton a flying stone threw his belt off the pulley
and .lambed the brake pedal when he was descending
a hill with a sharp turn at the bottom. Brakeless
he had to let her go—into a gutter 2ft. deep. He
was shot over the handles, and some damage was
done to the machine, but he straightened things
somewhat with a fence rail and bumped on, doing
the remaining 21 miles to Germanton in 36min.,
J?d re P or ti n ft there on time. He ultimately reached
Melbourne with the loss of only three points and
the above-mentioned portion of his anatomy. R. T.
Jones struck a deep gutter at Benalla, and somer-
saulted twice, but lost only a few inches of skin and
one point. A filthy patch of half-made road near
i ass capsized many competitors, T. Purves being
one of the worst sufferers. He had 15 falls altogether
during the run. E. C. Tyler and C. J. Kelynack
turned turtle in a 2ft. hole near Benalla,' but
both “reconstructed” and reached Melbourne without
the loss of points. A. Levi also came through
scathless, though had he been three inches further
a-rear when crossing the railway at Wangaratta the
express would have brought his remains down. A.
Sutherland broke a rim early in the ride, repaired
it with strips of tin, and struggled on, only to have
it buckled near Benalla. He walked the five miles
and bought a new one, and was thereabouts at the
finish. J. A. Fair jambed his finger at Wangaratta
and later again hit the same finger when removing
a piclced-up horseshoe. It’s a man’s game, all right.
Jack Donaldson, the Victorian sprinter,
put in a fine run at Cardiff (Wales) recently, when
he covered 220yds. in 21-Jsecs. and burst “Lachy”
McLachlan’s record of 21 2-ssecs. made at Napier
(M.L.) in 1902. Donaldson has now removed
nearly all the famous names from the record-
book. In getting over 220yds. in i-sec. less
than even time his run was probably better
than that in which he lifted Harry Hutchens’s figures
off the list for 300yds. Hutchens created 30secs.
(even time) for the distance as far back as 1884.
Donaldson is a warm-day runner, and complains if the
sun ducks behind a cloud for afew seconds. For him to
beat the 220.yds. figures during an English winter is
therefore almost marvellous. It goes to show that an
athlete can reproduce on foreign soil his best form,
provided he is properly acclimatised. Donaldson left
Australia in April, 1912, and it was not until a year
later that he eclipsed his best times. Chatting about
climates, Donaldson told the writer that Johannes-
burg (S’Afriea) is the best running place in the
world. The air thereabouts means yards to a runner.
On this point Postle, Conway, Mick Terry and Don-
aldson all agree.
The recent surfing fatality at Cronuila
Beach (Sydney), whereby three members of a family
were drowned, two of them in going to the assistance
of the other one, should make men who allow their
daughters to surf-bathe think hard. It must be
always remembered that surfing, though delightful, is
a dangerous pastime. Death is always hovering on
the line of breakers. In this case a party of ladies and
children went surfing on a (to them) unknown and lonelv
beach, and the onlv male with them was an heroic
boy of 12. The elder girl of the family walked into
the surf at as dangerous a spot as there is on the
coast near Sydney—a place where the shore suddenly
falls away to a great cliff, and where two warring
currents struggle for supremacy. She was quickly in
difficulties, and the hero of 12 swam out to try to
rescue her. He, too, was powerless against the
undertow. Then the younger sister of the first girl
went out to do or die—and died. First of all, there
should have been a danger notice at such a death-
trap. Secondly, families should never go surfing
where there are no life-savers on duty; if they do,
they should provide themselves with lifebelts. Had
that plucky 12-year-old boy had a cork jacket he
would have been able to keep his aunt afloat till
assistance came. As it was. when he was brought
out his heart was still beating faintly, but he was
too far gone to resuscitate.
The race for the Motor Boat Speed Cham-
pionship of Victoria, on New Year afternoon, ended
very unsatisfactorily. The only competitors were
Mr. Charles H. Ilelph, in Meteor 11., of Sydney; and
Mr. Cornwall, in Nautilus 11., of Victoria.
Meteor 11. is the new name of the famous hydro-
plane which, when owned by Mr. Tony Hordern, of
Sydney, was known as Kangaroo; and it is a craft
that can travel. The race was to be decided in three
bouts over five miles. The first went to Mr. Relph
and Meteor 11. in llmin. 27sec. When they were
ready for the second bout it was discovered that
Nautilus could not compete, the starting batteries
having run dry r so the Meteor had a walk-over,
there must have been some shocking bad manage-
ment to bring about such a fiasco.
The smashing of Dave Smith by Eddie
McGoortv was an impressive spectacle, even though
it was so brief. Smith was the first to enter the
ring, and bowed to the cheering thousands with easy
confidence. The special lights for photographic pur-
poses were blazing overhead, and the thoughtful Reg
Baker had countered their fervent heat by installing
two electric fans which drove the hot air upwards.
Then came McGoorty, “pride in his port, defiance in
his eye,” and superb self-confidence stamped all over
him. He had promised to knock Smith out in one
round ; he had told a daily newspaper that it would
be done with the left hook with which it was accom-
plished in New York, and had given a minute
account of how the left hook worked. The voice
of the announcer whispered that they had both
weighed list. 41b. that afternoon at 2 p.m. Yet
for some reason McGoorty looked a much bigger
and heavier man than Smith. He also looked a
more determined and dangerous fighter. From the
moment McGoorty entered the ring Smith seemed
worried. IVhen they posed together for the pictures
his face was somewhat drawn ; and when he accepted
the crayon portrait of McGoorty he looked as though
he was thinking of something very different—pro-
bably of how to block that dreaded left hook. And,
unfortunately, it did not occur to him that abso-
lutely the best defence against a Yankee left hook
is a straight left flush on to the nose, repeated
rapidly, and varied by stabs to the point. There
was a terrible lot of delay, and at last the pent-up
impatience of the crowd broke forth in a storm ot
hoots.
This writer’s notes of the fight consist of two
lines: “Smith, black trunks; McGoorty, green
trunks.” There was no time to write more, for just
at that moment Scott said, “Box on!” Smith came
out of his corner hesitatingly. His right glove was
up to cover his jaw, and he had a horrible half-
crouch. McGoorty had no thought of defence. He
came in perfectly open for the quick left stab to
the nose that would have sent all his aims awry—
but Smith had no left stab about him. Smith hardly
left his corner, and waited to be attacked. McGoorty
walked right across the ring, and feinted with his
left hook. Smith guarded and stepped back.
McGoorty bounded in. There was an awful smack,
a resounding thwack that could be heard in the White
City, and Smith shot against the ropes and slipped
down to the floor. The left hook had arrived. It
was obvious that Smith had forgotten for the moment
all he ever knew of how to fight. Instead of staying
down for nine and recovering as much as possible,
he sprang up at five. McGoorty let fly a left and
right that would have lifted Smith’s head right off.
But Smith ducked them both and backed away.
Still no sign of a poke to the nose. McGoorty fol-
lowed up, and again Smith was sent prone. Up
again, and hardly up before he was once more
hurled against the ropes and by them flung right
back to roll on to his side. Up once more and out of
a shower of ferocious wallops, with a split cheek, a
bleeding mouth, and a battered nose, he reeled against
the ropes on the northern side. There he covered
un his face and waited for what was coming. A
pained expression came into McGoorty’s eyes. He
saw his man was done. He sent a few lefts and
rights on to Smith’s gloves, when he could have
uppercut him. Smith reeled and swayed, and once
drove a feeble right swing, so pitifully futile that
the American looked at Scott and said something
about stopping the fight. But Smith was still on
his feet; his towel had not come in. “Box on!”
Muttering something about being sorry, McGoorty
again stepped forward and battered the gloves of
the swaying gladiator. Then Smith broke away
towards mid-ring, and McGoorty, leisurely tripping
after him, with a perfectly-measured right uppercut
sent him to the floor. He fell backwards, and turn-
ing as he fell, came down on his side and then
rolled over on to his back, with his arms spread-
eagled knocked out. Before the count could be
gone through the towel soared in. And even then
it was less than two minutes from the time
McGoorty started to walk across the ring to where
Smith awaited his doom.
Saturday night saw another disturbance
in the Stadium ring. This time it was “Young”
Saylor and Alf Morey, the Westralian boxer. Saylor
is a confident young man who is going to receive a
short, sharp shock before long. He is alleged to
have bet a compatriot a new suit of clothes that he
knocks out his first four opponents. Well, if he
leaves himself as open as he did on Saturday night,
he will see stars. Had Morey fought up to his usual
standard he would have shifted Saylor’s proboscis.
But he didn’t. The wild yells of the Yankee base-
ballers, who were fresh from the banquet at the Hotel
Australia, broke him up, and he fell, like the walls of
Jericho, before a great noise. Saylor is a most re-
markable fighter—it were a joke to call him a boxer.
He has a _ terrific reach, and he swings in blows
which no right-thinking boxer would wait to receive.
Morey did —which was a great mistake. He should
have charged right in and hit Saylor hard on the
nose or the chin immediately that young man began
to issue posters to the effect that he would, in the
near future, swing the right. Morey’s trouble was
that he would attempt to hit only about twice in
each round, and fought a purely defensive fight. Say-
lor hit all the time. Sometimes he hit right round
the other fellow’s head and landed the blow on the
mouth. Sometimes he hit right round his own neck
and shoulders and caught Morey in the same place.
His simian arms were so long he could hit from any
quarter and at any angle, and, being apparently
double-jointed, direction makes no difference to him.
Morey was down for nine seconds in the second round,
and apparently tired rapidly after that. The end
came in the 14th, when Saylor landed a left swing
on the ribs and just clipped the temple with the
right. Morey intended to get up at nine, but the
clock beat him ; he was actually counted out, and
Scott was placing his hand on Saylor’s head when
Morey rose and squared up once more. As he did so,
Saylor, taking no chances, suddenly uppercut him,
and that time Morey went down in grim earnest. It
was a weird happening, but took place so quickly
that the referee had no time to interfere.
Dave Smith is under contract to Baker
for three more fights, the opposite parties being Jeff
Smith, Jimmy Clabby and Georges Carpentier, if the
last-named can be induced to come to Australia. The
chances are that Smith will never fight really well
again, and if he is wise he will get out of the
gaipe. A man can stand only one hammering like
that which he received from McGoorty on New Year’s
night.

ESTABLISHED 30 YEARS.
There s a row over the sculling champion-
ship of the world. Ernest Barry is the holder of the
title, but on October 23 last year William Albany
challenged him to row for it and £2OO a-side,
according to the rules subscribed to by Barry himself
last year. He accompanied his challenge' with a
cheque for £25. So far, all was in order. Barry
replied that lie would be delighted to row Mr.
Albany, but the stake must be £5OO. Albany’s
backers looked up the rules, and found that £2OO is
the minimum for rowers of the same country. Since
then Barry has accented a challenge from ,T. Paddon
(N.S.W.), who, by the same rules, must put up
£5OO. As the rules give the holder three months
in which to accept a challenge, Albany lias notified
the world that at the end of that term he will claim
the title and defend it against all comers. Barry’s
object would appear to be to make matches with a
£5OO stake in preference to those worth only £2OO
—which, after all, is very natural.
Totalisator investments in and near Ade-
laide for last year came to just half a million sterling
for about 30 afternoons’ racing. Of that total the
various racing clubs got £37,500 towards their
stakes, the S.A. Government was “sweetened” by a
trifle of £12,500, and the people who did the
betting cut up among them £450,000 —90 per cent,
of what they put in. The useless, unproductive
parasite whose bag is not allowed to be seen, or his
voice heard, on a South Australian course, got
nothing.
The lion of Australian cricket just now'
is undoubtedly little C. G. Macartney (N.S.W.).
This season he has scored 195 against Queensland,
117 and 52 against South Aus., 142 against • Maori-
land, 53 against Victoria, and 162 in Grade Cricket
—668 runs, at the tall average of 120.1.

Bobbie Lewis, who is getting into the
sere and yellow leaf of Australian jockeydom, had
a joyous time on Wcstralian Derby Day. He pushed
Radnor to victory in the Derby, Hathor in the
Karrakatta Plate, and Dollar Dictator in the Visit-
ors’ Handicap—all consecutive winners.
After running second in the A.J.C. and
V.R.C. Derbies at Sydney and Melbourne, Radnor
was bought with a view to annexing the Westralian
event. He justified the deal by snatching the blue
ribbon and £l5OO prize money. Pilbarra, the
odds-on favorite, failed to run into even a place
among the dozen starters.
The Gght between Colin Bell, the Moree
(N.S.W.) heavyweight, and Sam McVea, the negro,
at the Olympia (Sydney), was brief and exciting
while it lasted. Bell started well, and showed excel-
lent defensive work, taking McVea’s famous left
hooks on his glove. Feeling his way cautiously, he
gave the great black a few that hurt. Backing out
of a clinch he held his head too low, and McVea
promptly chopped him across the back of the neck,
sending him to his knee. Springing up, he clinched.
As he broke away McVea hurled in a wicked left
hook, but Bell, evading it, countered with a splendid
right uppercut that sent the black to the boards
with a crash. Thunders of applause. McVea sprang
up, and a scramble ensued. The end came early in
the second round. McVea, unable to break through
Bell’s smother, left an opening. Quick as a flash
Bell uncovered and sent the left to the negro’s face ;
but, following up, he received a right on the cheek
which sent him down. Springing up he charged in
recklessly, and McVea met him with a right cross.
It caught him on the temple. Bell rolled over twice,
went to rise, but could not, and was counted out. He
had twisted his ankle out of joint and was sent to
hospital. McVea's luck was in. He would pro-
bably have won anyhow, but he would have had to
fight for it.

Fights between Sam Langford and Joe
Jeannette are recurrent outbursts which can be fore-
casted as accurately as the transits of Venus. The
arrangement seems to be that Langford shall win
two out of three or thereabouts. The latest took
place in Paris, and is described as a marvellous ex-
hibition of pluck by Jeannette, who, though knocked
silly in the 13th, kept going till the 20th round. Balder-
dash ! No fight between these bosom friends is ever
a genuine smashing match. They fool the public,
and the Parisian public seems a dead-easy public to
fool in the matter of scraps. No man on earth who
has been “knocked silly” in the 18th, let alone the
13th, round has a chance of stalling Langford off till
the 20th if the Tar Baby is really fighting.
Packev McFarland, the Yankee, is a some-
what unusual fighter. In his first recorded scrap he
earned a lOdol. note ; now he is worth over £lOO,OOO,
all made since 1904. He has fought 100 fights, and
won 53 on knocks-out and 16 on points. Four were
drawn ; the other 27 were “no decision” combats.
He has never had a decision given against him, has
never been knocked off his feet, has never had a
black eye, and has no sign of cauliflower ear, nor
any other mark of the game left on him. He has
now given up boxing, and is attending a college to
improve his education with a view to becoming a
professional man. How the boxer has changed!

“Leo Lear”: How’s this for bowling? At
a match in Tyrendarra (Vic.) R. Bannam, playing
for Milltown, went on to bowl when the score was
70 for two wickets. He outed five of the locals in
one over for no runs, four with consecutive halls and
the fifth with the last of the over. No ordinary
hump-and-hollow country wicket either, but matting
ort good concrete —a batsman's joy.
The latest development in international
sport is that Germany has sent a hockey team to*
play England. In that sort of tour it is often a
question of who can get away, and this team was all
from Hamburg, barring three Munichs and a Berlin.
Anyway, the English took it seriously, picked their
best team, and licked it by nine goals to one, the
same score England made against France (in Paris)
earlier in the year.

“Moana”: A sample of how records are
manufactured in the Land of Wooden ~ Ham.
Recently C. K. G. Billings, the owner of the famous
trotter Uhlan, announced that this fleet-footed prad
would make a final appearance on the track at Lex-
ington (U.S.A.), when an attempt would be made to
seriously damage the previous best for a mile. The
crack trotter was hitched to a four-wheeled waggon
along with a galloper. Charlie Tanner drove, and
alleged experts present contend that for seven-eighths
of the journey Uhlan led the pacemaker and carried
weight. As the mile fled past in lmin. 54i sec., the
trip is hailed as a world’s record for Uhlan, and the
news is cabled that at Lexington (U.S.A.) a horse
has trotted a mile in lmin. 54isec. —a world’s re-
cord! But is it? Is any record made under such
conditions worthy of serious consideration?

“Boudoir Talks.”
Every normal woman is always interested in any
plan by which she can quickly enhance her beauty,
provided the plan is perfectly safe and simple. Ever
since the discovery that ordinary cleminite, such as
any chemist can supply, is an instantaneous and
harmless lieautifier, there has been a growing demand
lor it from smart women everywhere. They usually
get about an ounce and add just enough water to
dissolve it. A little of this perfectly harmless lotion
gives a beautiful complexion to any face instantly.
It renders face powder quite unnecessary. Moreover
its use cannot be detected. The skin is instantly
beautified, but appears perfectly natural under the
closest scrutiny. * * * To make the eyelashes grow
long dark and curling, apply a little mennaline with
the finger-tips occasionally. It is absolutely harmless
and beautifies the eyebrows as well. * * * Pilenta soap
is the most satisfactory for all complexions. It
even works well in cold or hard water.

the Lyttelton by-election the Dominion said of its
accursed contemporary: “It is apparent that the
Times has again been guilty of that inaccuracy and
misrepresentation which the public 'have - grown to
expect from it in political matters.” Whereat the
Times wiped the ink out of its eye and tore.into its

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
This poet never has a word to say
When sits he, pen in hand, betimes to write
So has he scarce a thought from morn to night
IN or is ins output worthy, day by day.
These circumstances may not be unique;
There may, perhaps, be many another bard
Who finds poetic composition hard ;
Nor is the explanation far to seek.
High in that mountain cleft, the little springs
Come trickling down from dripping stone to stone;
Higher, upon the topmost peak, alone,
A wind-racked pine-tree to the worn rock clings.
h ar, on the plain, the widening river winds
Till straightened-and controlled by hand of man;
And, over it, the mighty bridges span,
And, on it, ships, the toys of master minds.
H'rn ! Does the explanation seem far sought,
\Vhy poets do not labor as they might—
“Vlby I and others do not reach the height,
Nor fill so full the measure as, we ought?
We sit midway upon an easeful slope,
No harried pine to whip the storm ta song ;
Nor spring nor runnel sounds its silver gong • ’
We sit, midway, and play with idle hope.
We flare not be the greater, lesser thing—
The ordered force, the cultivated power;
We breathe the unbought sunshine ,of the hour
And, scarcely else than as we yawn, we sing. ’

A coming man in Queensland Liberal
politics is undoubtedly Colonel Rankin, who
represents the sugar farmers and miners of
Howard in the State Parliament. An hon-
orary Minister-ship already dangles before
him—an earnest of the impending full-
blown honors of the near future.

A recent Bulletin forecast as to the
appointment of Gordon Graham to-be Under-

is an able, courteous oflicial, full of infor-

Under-Sec. looks a safe prediction. He is

Pastor Niemeyer, head of the Queensland

“Bildad”: “Billy” Murphy, M.L.A. for
Groydon and Burketown and a few thou-

Independent party in the Bananalaud Par-
liament, _ and is said to have no difficulty
in securing regular attendance at divisions
or maintaining leadership. This is possiblv
due to the fact that when he puts on his
truly remarkable hat the whole of the partv
is under the one roof. Canvassing a Gulf
electorate is strenuous work, and Murphy
Had a lively experience just before the last
elections, in which several large crocodiles,
a small boat, and two days of hunger and
tlm-st were associated with a visit to Burke-
town The temptation to Gulf crocodiles
must be very considerable when Murphy goes
anoat, as he would provide several meals
lor a whole creekful. Strenuousness does
not cease even with the declaration of the
polls A dissatisfied minority is apt to put-
tlie boot into the successful candidate on
occasion, and Murphy tells a tale of a dance
at the Einasleigh at which he realised from
personal experience that one or two of the
dancers had omitted to change their work-

Magnificent passage from speech by
M.L.A. Luke (Aubigny) : “If the men of the
Labor party would stop pulling the legs of
the worker and take to pulling teats, it
would be a good thing for the State.” Note
the Liberal cocky’s idea of an earthly para-
dise-—a land full of cows and everybody
milking away like mad.
A Brisbane milk-and-water vendor, when
charged with carrying adulterated milk,
sought to excuse himself on the plea that
he carried two cans, one of pure milk for
his paying customers, the other a mixture
tor the bad pays. So the well-to-do, with
the generally-empty cradle, can get the
pure article, while the poor man, with a
houseful of children, to whom the pure milk
is necessary, gets the starvation diet. The 1
trader was quite annoyed when the PM
see his point, and fined him £24
mill his license wasn’t cancelled, so he
is given a chance to sell some more water
at the price ,of milk, and thus get square
with everybody.
I? J ian^an : Barcaldine, which grows some
ut the finest wool in the world, and that on
a minimum of water, was recently congratu-
lating itself on getting a much-needed water
supply. The Government had agreed to
hand out £5OOO for an elevated tank,-etc
and tenders were accepted away back in
April. As dry weather was expected the
Government was asked to hustle. It hustled
in its own way. After a few months, when
most ot the goats of the district were draw-
! n », wader from the bore, it answered the
halt-dozen telegrams to say that the Depart-
ment had searched all over the office for a
suitable engine in vain; and as it would
take three months to indent one from Eng-
land, by which time the dry season would be
over, it had decided to let the matter drop.
Lut Barcaldine, being pernickety, is not so
willing to let the matter drop, as it expects
another dry season to start some day. Also
it does not believe that Queensland cannot
provide the small engine necessary. In fact
the local tinsmith offered to make one at a
pinch.

My Dear Thargomindaii,

Commissioner Evans, of the Railway De-

the loud and persistent howls that are

other Queenslander who received the appro-

who has had a long and honorable career
m the police force. He receives the Kind’s
police medal, which goes only to a favored

Much excitement was caused'here on Box-
paj when the public got to know that
the Goorparoo Shire Council had actually
put the bailiff into the Queen Alexandra
Home, because some paltry rates had not
been paid. What makes the thing wSse is
that the committee of the Home had advised
, h< 1 ‘ Co ™ cd > through its solicitors, that it
did not think it was liable for the ordinary
rates, and intended to submit (he matter to
two justices as provided for in the Local
Authorities Acts. The Home is an excellent
institution, and, though largely under the
supervision of the Methodist Church, is abso-
tiUeiy non-sectarian m its work. The Coun-
cil claims that it had to put the bailiff in

the bailiff went the way of all bailiffs after
the debt is paid. By-the-bye, where do bailiffs
go after receipting the bill? Acting-Premier
Barnes who is a member of the Shire Coun-
cil, has been rather scathingly criticised over
the scratchpenny business. In contrast to
the behavior of this Shire, it is worth notie-

Another wedding was that of Miss Lad-

Doris Aiming and Ivy Shield, two
picturesque maids, walked demurely behind

Jones family to the admiring consideration

to the good in that receptacle where the grev

The races on Saturday were not very
largely attended. Most of the female

as usual two of the Best-dressed.

.
To produce a full, rounded bust where none
existed before, to grow new flesh in the exact
quantity desired, and to raise up a fallen,
flat or hanging bust to perfect firmness and
beauty—such is the seeming miracle now
wrought by modern science. No woman
need longer be humiliated and embarrassed
because she is thin, flat-chested and unde-
veloped, for the delightful fulness and re-
freshing firmness of a captivating bust is
easily within her reach. For more than
thirty years Frofessor Muller, the eminent
chemist and scientist, searched and studied
with tireless zeal in an effort to discover a
means for creating new flesh wherever de-
sired. It seemed at times like a hopeless task,
but he steadily kept on with his scientific
experiments, casting aside all the old
theories. At last, after more than a quarter
of century, his labor was crowned with suc-
cess. He has given to the world what is
probably the most important discovery of
modern times. Formerly, there was abso-
lutely nothing known which would actually
enlarge the bust to the size and firmness
desired, but now that a development of from
2 to 7 inches can be so easily obtained in
three weeks’ time, it is not surprising that
the news of this remarkable discovery is
already being heralded over two continents.
No woman is too old; no woman is too
young, to benefit by its marvellous power.
It is entirely external, and strictly scientific
and hygienic in every respect. You can see
the new flesh created on your bust before
your very eyes from the first day you com-
mence its use. It possesses wonderful effi-
cacy for filling out hollows in the neck,
shoulders or arms, or nroducing an enlarge-
ment on any part of the body. Yet its
specific action is upon the bust. AND WE
STRONGLY CAUTION YOU NOT TO
USE THIS METHOD WHERE YOU DO
NOT DESIRE NEW FLESH TO GROW.
Professor Muller has written a wonderfully
interesting booklet explaining the exact
causes for non-development and the remedy.
This booklet describes how any bust can be
made large, firm and beautiful, and it
should be in the hands of every woman who
desires to become more magnetically charm-
ing and fascinating. Only a few thousand
copies of the booklet will be distributed in
this country. Arrangements have been made,

to read it at all. And this paper doesn’t feel suffici-
ently interested to whip them to the profitless task.
.... Gidgee: An interesting lot. Glad to have more.
....Vi. E.: Better let it drop n0w....G. Thomas:
Please send us your assurance that “The Player” is
your own work. .. .Lochryan: Fair jingle; but not
good enough to push its way in at this late hour.
... .E.A.T.: Cut it out when it appears, indicate date
and page, and send to accountant, who will remit. .. .
Gil. D.: Good enough work ; but that field is already
covered.... Opal (Lightning Ridge): Send name and
address to accountant, this office. .. .M.A.R. (V.):
Thin, conventional humor. ... H.T.: A bit rough for
print. .. .John C. M.: You will have to learn to
shout back at him. This is just a faint pencil
murmur. .. .Bellerive: Just as well to begin the New
Year cheerfully :—■
SCENE IN THE SLUMS.
In a lane off little Burke-st
During a late hour of the night
Two young and ill-famed Women
Like two wild cats did fight.
Blood trickled from their hollow cheeks
As the drunken creatures fought
Prompted by a roughish mob
Whom enjoyed the cruel sport
When a woman from a Chinese den
Wrest the opponents apart.
The poor haggard creature of the slums
Had humanity in her heart.
. ...M.K.T.: The old mistaken-identity gag again!
Thrown out with enthusiasm.... Elliott S.: Try again
in 10 years’ time. .. .R.K.S.: Theme is too well-worn
and the verses limp... .Glad I.: You have a light
touch, but the theme is old and right out of our
line. . . .Noskcag: Types are faithfully sketched, but
the story isn’t worth while E.F.L.: Usual hay-
stack of words without the needle H.G.: “Joe's
Policy” is very wearisome verse D. 8.: Smooth
rhymes propped up insufficiently with one idea....
J.R. (W.A.) : Very faint cry indeed....O. Clancy:
Artificial.... F.G.S.C.: This is the best of it:—
The widow cursed him where he stood,
Cursed him for ever with his brood,
And on his bosom swooned.
The shrinking wretch ne’er guessed that he
Was doomed for ever—Doomed.
. ...J.S. (Q.): First outbreak:—
“Now lads,” said the gallant old stockman, as he
tossed off his brandy and s.,
“It’s a jolly good night for a gallop, and we’d
better be moving, I guess.”
So we saddled and bridled our horses, and took to
the road with a shout ;
For the old ’un, when once he had started, wasn’t cue
for humbugging about.
Maybe; still we’d have liked him better if he had
provided a story.... Stuart Mack: Clever, but the
subject does not warrant the space. .. .Agra: The
autobiography of “Bellerive” appeared on Red Page
of Sept. 19, 1912... .Voiceless: Ably put, but space
unavailable... .C. 8.: (1) AVhat is the incorrect state-
ment? (2) You can rest easy that W. M. Hughes
knew the exact position. (3) Your statement that
“the Massey Government stands to-day higher in the
people’s favor than any previous Government has for
many, many years” may be right; but the fact that
the Government has been defeated at the last two by-
elections raises a pint or even a hogshead of doubt.
(4) You appear to be an uncompromising partisan.
. ...Ginty: The bell story helped to amuse Shem,
Ham, Japheth and the rest of the boys in the long,
wet nights. The other fired on suspicion. .. .Wun
Casey: Ditto. .. .Rebellious Old Person: Some good
points, but don’t know what you are driving at most
of the time. Do y0u?....J.H. (S. Aus.) : Come in
here: —
Archibald Henry Peake,
The gerrymandering sneak,
Than Richard Butler
Is cleverer and subtler.
F. ,W. Young
Has his principles slung;
While John G. Bice
Had also his price.
Poor T. H. Pascoe
Is the Ministry’s fiasco,
Homburg
But the catalogue must have an end somewhere....
W.11.P.: Previous publication disqualifies the matter.
.. . . W.O S.: Nearly, but not quite well enough done.
.. . . J. 11.8.: “Which is the first dgy of the week, and
(2) has it always been so?” (1) Wednesday; we go
to press Tuesday night. (2) No; only since The
Bulletin was established, about 30 years ag0....
Yardo Minardo: Were the insects very drunk when
you dipped them in the inkpot ahd set them to
crawl over the paper? On one sheet they have ap-
parently broken out into what looks like verse; and
that lot may be intelligible enough for a judgment.
.... Don Q.: We are very tired of sub-editing you.
Write one-fifth as much and put into that one-fifth
five times the pains you now put into the lot, and
you’ll begin to be a satisfactory contributor. At
present, of contributors in the five years and over
class, you are the most heart-breaking.
“Melb”: During Premier Elmslie’s 17
days, Watt and McLeod collogued. McLeod:
“I claim a place in the Ministry for 1 myself
and one follower. Also that Murray and
Attorney-General Brown leave.” Watt: “I
will take you in, but no follower. And I
refuse to drop either Murray or Brown, but
will make McKinnon Attorney-General, and
shunt Brown to something else.” McLeod
declined to take office unless one of his party
was with him. So Watt went ahead with-
out any of them. Obviously McLeod with
his following, and the Ministers discarded
by Watt, will soon join Labor in Opposition.
Watt seems to be working only to keep him-
self in evidence with a view to the flying
trapeze act, a. la the Iceberg, landing into the
Federal Parliament.
Agar Wynne begins to dawn on public
notice in Melbourne as a high-frequency
lunch-expert. In the purlieus of Parliament
House for some months past Australia’s
P.M.G. has been feeding relays of legislators,
Government officials and other persons vari-
ously connected with his new job. The
M’s.P. he “dines” in batches, the Labor lion
sitting quietly beside the Liberal lamb and
never forgetting to use its table-napkin at
the right moment, while Labor sheep and
Liberal goats chew amicably at portions of
the same cabbage. The latest of the Wynne
series was that at which the Federal Han-
sard men were fed, together with a company
of assorted pressmen from all over Australia.
As Wynne is popularly reported to have an
income of “five figures.” it should be pleasant
for those lunched or dined to remember that
they are not nibbling a fellow-man into the
Insolvency Court.

For the Country Horseman
The saddle here illustrated is' expressly designed
fur country use, for stock riding, etc., and is built
of the best materials throughout. If any of our
friends are requiring such a saddle they will nnd
this a genuine bargain.
li
It has a hogsldn seat, a plated bar-tree, extia
lon>' flaps, with points to buckle below. An economi-
cal 0 feature is the skirt, which extends all round
and thus adds years of wear to the saddle by pro-
tecting its interior from the weather. It has a
deep “sweepy” seat, 4in. kneepads, nickel-plated
iron stirrups, and double buckle leather girth. The
price complete is £3/15/? Mention of Tub
Bulletin- when ordering will ensure your having a
leather surcingle given in free, and the saddle will
be forwarded freight paid. It is to be obtained

Constantly Itching, Burned When
Put in Water, Would Rub and
Scratch Until Hand Raw. Used
Cuticura Soap and Ointment.
Now Quite Recovered.
“Coo-ee," Chirnside St., Footscray, Vic.
“The affection from which I suffered is,
thanks to Cuticura, quite cured. It first
appeared around my knuckles and finger
joints. I first noticed it by my hands con-
stantly itching. On putting my hands in
water the burning feeling would nearly send
mo distracted. The palms of my hands
were all cracked and the skin completely
peeled off them, and on awakening during
the night tho continual itching would keep
mo awake for hours. I would rub and
scratch them until tho backs of my hands
would look like raw flesh. I determined to
try the Cuticura Remedies, and having Cu-
tipura Ointment in the house, I bathed my
hands with Cuticura Soap and then applied
Cuticura Ointment. I suffered with this
dreadful affliction for six weeks, but perse-
vered with Cuticura Soap and Cuticura
Ointment and am now quite recovered. I
always use Cuticura Soap as a toilet soap
and would not be without the Cuticura
Ointment." (Signed) Miss C. Florence
Daley, October, 1912.
The regular use of Cuticura Soap for toilet
and bath not only tends to preserve, purify
and beautify the skin, scalp, hair and hands,
but assists in preventing inflammation, irri-
tation and clogging of the pores, the common
cause of pimples, blackheads, and other un-
wholesome conditions of the skin. Cuticura
Soap and Cuticura Ointment are sold
throughout the world. Liberal sample of
each mailed free, with 32-p. Skin Book.

ties.
Besides being a True Hair Grower, my
preparation quickly removes DANDRUFF,

“X P D”: After having spent a few years in Aus-
tralian engineering works, I have acquired a solid
contempt for the argument that certain articles
be made by Australian workers, and that the tarill
should accordingly be very merciful to those goods.
For years past, Queensland-built locomotives have
shown themselves at least equal to the English and
Yankee importations in efficiency ; they are superior
in faithful finish of the little parts that count for
long life; arid,, most important, they are abstemious
in regard to running-shed repairs and renewals.
They’re a bit dearer than the engines built by Eng-
lish fitters at 33s. a week; but —neglecting the con
snleration whether it isn’t better for us to distribute
£4000 at Newport or Ipswich than £3500 in Yonc
shire or Philadelphia—I reckon there are ways of
bringing down the cost without lowering wages For
one thing, the railway departments might stock one
set of templates and patterns for each class of loco,
required, and lend them to successful tenderers, in-
stead of obliging each firm to work out its problems
from the drawings. Also let the draughtsmen s
for making unnecessary differences lie tween parts be
firmly suppressed, so that a lot of class X gear can
be duplicated for class Y. Such are the fruits of
my experience now gratefully dropped on to the
plate of my country.
“Moana”: In B. 4/12/’13 “J.D.K.Z.” wails about
artists and singers being rushed, regardless of ex-
pense, to Fogtown to “finish off, and wants to
know why the same thing isn’t done with young
fellows who show brilliant talents as drapers, it is.
The big rag firms of Maoriland, for instance, rush
more young men away to Smokeville in one year to
be finally polished for the trade than are sent in
10 years to learn to spoil good canvas or to make a
pleasant noise. M.L. rag palaces are full of young
men who have been “finished” at home at the firm s
expense. Whether in these days of lightning change
in fashions a young man can gain any experience in
Fogland likely to be worth a red cent, or whether
he can really learn to measure calico there better
than in M.L., is debatable; but there s no denying
the haughty mannah six months in. the Big Smoke
can tack on. Certainly, some firms are now going
slower, having discovered that the finishing p
cess is liable to be disastrous when the Rag Kings
bucolic clients meet the results on the other side of
the counter.
* * * *
“Hermes”: I have just opened a tin of Rhodesian
tobacco mixture, grown in the youngest colony ot the
Empire, manufactured in Capetown, and exported to
the uttermost ends of Empire. Australia can glow
an infinite variety of tobaccos, including weed of
high grade and distinctive flavor. But so far as l
can ascertain there is no Australian mixture on the
market of even Australia. Here the hall-mark is.
“Made of the best American leaf. Why? the
Jews in Capetown more patriotic than the Anglo-
Yankees of N.S.W. and Victoria? When Joe Cook
has grown tired of doing nothing, and doing it very
well, he might turn his attention to this problem,
and ask the Trust in a firm voice when it proposes to
justify itself. A Trust that smothers local tobacco-
growers to encourage those of Old Virginia wants
arguing with —and no nonsense about it.
“T OI”: For something like half a century
Bathurst’(N.S.W.) has been supplied with gas by a
private co. founded by John Newlands Wark, one-time
engineer to the A.G.L. Co. When J. N. Wark died
he left the works to his widow and sons by his first
wife They carried them on until the widow s
death recently, and are now selling to the municipal
council. Under Mark Hammond s Municipal Gas Act
the Bathurst council nearly 30 years ago established
gasworks primarily to supply the city with lights,
and incidentally to sell to private consumers. This
latter was deemed illegal, and a lawsuit ensued,
which ended in favor of the council. The Warks
who were running the business on family with
very little outlay for labor, cut the price to the very
finest, and the municipal works had to do likewise.
Private consumers gave the council and the Warks
month about, so as to keep the competition going
and the price down. Now after a generation has
passed, the council buys out Wark, and thus at last
gets a monopoly of the business.
“J P ” • In the early days of the Maoriland strike
disturbance Auckland couldn’t get sugar away, and
a sugar famine threatened in the South Island. Away
down at the polar end of the Rickety Isles the little
Scotch storekeepers openly cursed the strikers when
they heard the news ; secretly they moved round to
the telegraph office and wired the Employers Federa-
tion at Wellington to stand firm, and then dashed
back to their stores and pushed the price of the
sugar they had on hand up to nearly three times the
usual figure. # *
“Theodore Hogwash”: The directors and manager
of one strict and economical fortress of finance pre-
sented the staff and others with a quaint sort of
Christmas card. Outwardly it was just like the
thousand other inane things that wear out the post-
man at this time of year; but instead of the usual
greetings it was afflicted inwardly with a number of
confused yelps by Elbert Hubbard on the subject of
health. They covered the paper excitedly without
diffusing any useful knowledge or committing Hub-
bard or the directorate to anything definite, and were
calculated to blow up the sympathetic reader and
give him that light feeling in his feet without actu-
ally lifting him anywhere. The final burst was as
follows: “Breathe deeply in the open air, holding the
breath, then expelling it slowly through the nos-
trils ” As soon as possible after receiving this
valuable Christmas bonus, the various members of
the staff breathed through their nostrils—breathed so
hard that they could be heard all over the place.
Some of them haven’t finished yet.
TWO KINDS OF CANNIBALISM.

Gillan, Presbyterian missionary, now visiting: Syd
addS'tbat about 1500 Meg
natives were Christians, but there were still 10,000,
the majority of whom
It was on Christmas Eve I read
A holy man had just come home
With tales of cannibals who fed
Upon their friends across the foam.
At once the plaintive Christmas bells,
The dreary hymns and carols dire
Seemed to be drowned by savage yells
And hiss of “long pig” on the fire.
The cannibal’s white molars shone.
And grisly visions round me swirled ;
How sad to think he sat upon
The round plum-pudding of the World .
I cursed the savage at his feast
And wished him by a cruiser bust,
Until I thought: “The howling beast
Is somewhat milder than a Trust!
“The Trust devours me ev’ry day ;
He, eats me once and it’s Good-night!
The Trust takes all I have away,
Yet leaves me life and appetite!”
I heard the carols and the bells
That old Romance with puddings weave,
And longed to hear the honest yells
Of cannibals on Christmas Eve.

(From a photo.)
The Champion Surf Siren
tells how she Benefited by
the use of REXONA
SKIN and FACIAL SOAP.
Miss Nance Mclnerney, West’s Pictures
Champion Surf Siren, is one of Sydney s
fairest daughters. Not only did she win the
first heat of the Surf Sirens’ Competition by
a large surplus of votes, hut she was also the
winner of the Challenge Competiton.
Miss Mclnerney is certainly a picture of
health and beauty, and in the accompanying
letter she tells how she has found Rexona
Skin and Facial Soap indispensable for her
toilet.
21 Darling Street,
Glebe Point, Sydney,
29th Dec., 1911.
The Manager,
“Rexona,” Sydney.
Dear Sir, —
I have long found your Rexona Skin and
Facial Soap indispensable for my toilet. I
use it for my face, and it keeps my skin fair
and delicate; also for my hair, which it keeps
in perfectly healthy condition. For my teeth
I find it unsurpassed; its disinfectant quali-
ties keeping my mouth sweet and my teeth
pearly. I would never be without Rexona
Soap.
Yours faithfully,
(Sgd.) NANCE McINERNEY.
THE REXONA HABIT.
A habit formed is hard to break. Bad habits are easily formed, but good habits can be attained
almost as easily. The Rexona habit results in health and beauty, and once formed will never be
broken.
There are two Rexona hab-
its —that of using Rexona
Ointment to heal all injuries
to the skin, and the Rexona
Soap habit, which consists of
keeping oneself clean and pure
•with a delicately-scented and
medicated soap. Rexona Oint-
ment and Rexona Soap mean
skin health and beauty, com-
fort to the user, and immu-
nity from disease. So, form
the Rexona habit. Start with
a cake of Rexona Soap and a
1/6 pot of Ointment. Soon
you will be glad to know that
Rexona Soap is put in dainty
boxes containing three cakes
each, and that Rexona Oint-
ment is also sold in larger-size
triangular pots, containing
nearly four times the quantity
of the 1/6 size, which are
sold at 3/- each.

The Holiday.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
AN idle holiday !
How sleepy all things seemed !
There was no wind at play.
And while the foreland dreamed
A languid, leisured sea
Crawled shoreward sluggishly.
In golden indolence
Stood tree and bush and flower;
All-still and all-intense,
* The sun burned hour by hour ;
\ sea-hawk poised on high
Seemed fixed against the sky.
Men’s thoughts on lazy feet
A tired procession crept;
Through mart and city street
Felt-footed silence stept;
O’er all there hung a sense
Of life held in suspense.
Through noon a,nd afternoon
There rose no trill of bird ;
On harbor and lagoon
No leaping mullet stirred
The waters, soft as oil,
With sudden, white turmoil.
Too tired of journeying
On some lone coastal quest,
Red beak beneath his wing.
The black swan lay at rest;
Again and yet again
The far-flight called in vain.
On green and velvet moss
Awake, yet not awake,
His skin a satin gloss.
Coil, circling coil, the snake
Amid tall flowers and trees,
Bay basking at his ease.
I I hought, “All things are mute-
The sea, the trees, the soil;
The spell is absolute,
Surcease from care and toil;
Too tired to work or play
All things keep holiday.”
Then pondering mute and still,
A shadow seemed to fall —
What moved on yonder hill?
A dark-plumed funeral!
Death knows no easeful breath ;
There is no rest for Death.
N.S.W.
RODERCI QUINN.
Father Christmas.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
IN my days of adolescence anything in
the shape of a “permanency” I de-
tested. Bike a bee, from flower to
flower, I flew from billets. Now the billets
fly from me. In fact, of late, I can never
overtake one. But of all the jobs in which
I have engaged, my impersonation of Santa
Claus was the most rotten.
It was late in December when I awoke
one morn with an extra distaste for life.
Something seemed hanging over me —had
haunted my dreams overnight, and for the
moment I recollected not what it was.
Then memory rushed over me. I had a
job. I was going to Work —to Earn Money.
My hash proprietress knocked at my
door at that moment. She is, so she tells
me, a Wuss-leyan, and my irreligious de-
cline towards death and the “wooden ulster”
had given her conscience pause.
So she had taken advantage of me some
days before, when I was hysterically weak
after my last jag, and had called in her
“parson.”
He was a fine, bluff person, full of words
and vim, and he must have hypnotised me,
for at the end of his oratorical outburst I
found that I had placed my signature (look-
ing like a mangled centipede) on a Total
Abstinence card, and the lapel of my coat
was adorned with a fragment of blue ribbon.
Next day, the parson used his influence
for me with a city firm of drapers, with the
result that, taking me at my card’s valua-
tion, the firm had engaged me as Father
Christmas for its annual window display.
Descending that morning to the dining-
room I almost died of repulsion at sight of
breakfast. A pick-me-up would have con-
verted it into a dipsomaniac’s feast, but,
alas ! from my coat there shyly peeped the
“blue” of the abstainer, therefore
By 10 o’clock I was feeling my feet in
Toyland. Doll-land was in the same estate,
also a sanded sea-front block inhabited by
some glassy-eyed, dummy bathers in cheap
sea-wear, while some live waterfowl dese-
crated the foreground.
There was a shop-walker—unctuous to the
public, to me peremptory. He coached
me in the r6le of Santa before I made my
bow, and folded me snugly into the red
robe which historical repute has handed
down as the correct wear of the old fraud.
He hooked into position the Niagara of
white goats’ hair which foams over my
chest, having first of all caged me behind a
stifling mask. The modeller had created
this with a movable smile. It was a fear-
some thing, this mask, fit to rank for sheer
cruelty with the iron hood of the Dark Ages.
It was suffocating—it stank —being a med-
ley of goats’ hair and glue, pasteboard and
wax. It was shaped with genial knobs and
senile hollows which, jammed against the
natural protuberances of my phizog, bruised
me sore.
The venerable furrows of its brow jagged
me on the under side like glass filings. Then
it was furnished with a hidden string, which
being dragged allowed my movable grin to
broaden into laughter. Two tweaks pro-
duced loud laughter, three, uproarious merri-
ment. What four produced was never
revealed.
It took some brain-work, and a lot of the
shopwalker’s time to make me mask-per-
fect, but I was declared fit at last, and
made a triumphant arrival in a railed-off
enclosure in the very heart of Toyland, with,
overhead, a banner, announcing Christmas
novelties given away for, next to nothing.
Perhaps there is some of the natural
actor in me. At any rate.. I soon found
mvself doing before the public, some infern-
ally silly posturing, which for sheer asiniuity
was without compeer, and which was well
calculated to lower the status of Santa
Claus iu the minds of all beholders.
Armed with a bundle of tickets and aided
by an elderly little girl got up as a fairy
I worked hard in my new environment, try-
ing to live up to the “new leaf” which the
parson had turned over for me.
Pulling the hidden string and cackling
accordingly 1 soon won golden opinions on
every side. I was all aglow, partly honest
endeavor, partly rush of blood to the head,
while beads of perspiration as big as grapes
coursed over my hidden features.
It was a scene of wild excitement. Being
a free show, we were deuced popular. Sway-
ing mobs of bargain-hunters clung tenaci-
ously to the trails of my enclosure. They
watched my tickets, and hung upon my
foolish smile, my lightest beck, with colossal
interest. Then, at the hint of the fairy, who
seemed .to have the ear of the management,
I scattered free tickets, entitling the good
catches of the crowd to a dip off the “three-
penny table.” Mob rule took the field. Bike
an angry sea the women rolled and surged
round me, whirling and circling to secure a
ticket, grovelling among the public hooves
for them. While these were on all-fours,
others fought for a footing near the rail-
ings. Matrons of repute clawed like cats.
Hatbrims clashed and were knocked awry,
and hatpins fought duels on their own
account.
After one of these scrums I saw one
decorated with a wad of human hair—the
scalped, for aught I heard, being blissfully
unconscious of her loss.
Children screamed. Girls fainted. The
shopwalker, beaten out of bounds, looked
anxious and gave orders to close the front,
doors. As for me, I felt gloriously elated.
1 was the draw, the magnet that had. cor-
nered the greedy emotions of this crowd. It
was assuredly “my hour,” and I grew in
popularity. One glimpse of my red hood
and goats’-liair beard brought more tumul-
tuous souls rushing headlong from the dull
departments of the “Manchester” and “Tail-
oring” to greet me, and with one pull of my
laughter string and its resultant cackle I
made them mine for aye.
For every ticket given away we sold 100.
We were doing good business, and the
fairy’s takings were enormous. But upon
me, with my fatal dislike of a “permanency,”
the situation soon began to pall, and it was
cruelly hot in the red robe.
My “silly ass” grin was still joy to the
crowd, but to me, prisoned behind it, life
had become a ghastly, breathless affair, satu-
rated with the odor of goats—long dead —
and I longed—ye gods liow I longed-for
liquor.
Once I cornered the supercilious shop-
walking cad and demanded the right to
“wet my whistle.”
He was not altogether inhuman. He sent
warm tank water, but there’s many a slip
’twixt the mask and the lip, and.
owing to Santa’s mouth being protuberant
and mine flat and leather-lipped, but little
of the liquor reached my interior.
Thus, prisoned behind my movable smile,
dying slowly of thirst, helpless, defenceless,
I prayed that the end might come quickly.
The gaudy panorama of Christmas gifts
(there was one silly toy there which mad-
dened me—a wooden man holding a bottle
of lager), 'the heat, the crowd, the adula-
tion ! It told cruelly upon an abstainer still
in the infancy of his abstinence and far
from strong. My vows began to weaken. I
was sick of my job. I hated the fairy and
refused to take her cues —result, cessation
of free-ticket scrambles and consequent loss
of Popularity. Business began to fall off.
The shop-walker, too, kept nagging. Under
cover of pretended Christmas banalities he
would growl in undertones. “Book alive,
man. Hustle! You’re losing grip losing
trade.” „„ _ ~
“Well, what d’ you expect?” I would re-
tort. “No sale? Bot o’ stingy jays ; can t
force ’em to buy; they want free tickets all
the bally time.” , .
“Be careful, sir, be careful, he advised.
“Can’t you look pleasant? Pull the string
and give them a laugh or two.” I did so,
and, as the cackling mask once more tell
silent, he started jawing again.
“Crack a few jokes,” he said ; ‘ the crowd s
thinning.” ,
“No go, ole man,” I replied. Never made
a joke in my natural. Bife is real, life is
earnest; life is but”— —
“Don’t argue,” he cussed ; you re a frost,
sir, a Jack Frost.”
“I wish you meant it, I replied.
“Shut up, you silly fool,” he hissed.
“You’re here to hold trade, and you’d better
be careful or I’ll complain to the manage-
ment and you’ll lose your engagement.”
tie thrust his ugly face out at me. Joke
with ’em, can’t you,” he ordered.
“Not at the price.” I answered insolently.
“I’m sweated enough as it is. I’ll strike, in
a minute. Go away and get me something
to drink, or I’ll strangle you with my
rotten beard.”
“Oh, go to !”
A clear, high drawl called him from me.
It was a serpentine sylph from “the Corsets.”
He went to settle an incipient strike there
also, and in his absence, in accord with
orders from his understudy, the fairy and I
left the enclosure for a short and brilliant
season in the shop window.
The window was my stage, the fairy my
satellite. Behind me, as drop scene, a
Christmas tree; before me, the man in the
street.
Would that I had been more tractable,
less thirsty, the better to improve that
shining hour. The fairy tripped prett.il>
round me. With a wand she drew the pub-
lic’s eye to suspended advertisements:
“Santa Claus Gives Away
Christmas Novelties.”
This was but a figure of speech. We
gave nothing, save the lie to the annoum e
ment. . , , . „„
Within the shop window it was hot as
blazes. My throat felt like burning flannel,
and I muttered imprecations in my goats-
hair beard. “Laughter” was turned on ess
and less frequently. , “Boud and uproarious
had gone, mutinied long since, and at last I
gave up entirely and just stood and cussed.
The fairy turned queen’s evidence, and up
came the shopwalker. »
“Smarten up.” he hissed, under cover , of
a jest. “The crowd’s drifting—you re losing
’em —they’re going next door ; there s a clown
there, look pleasant. Baugh, man . laugh.

WHEN HEALTH
BEGINS TO GO.

'Every

Story.”
From birth to death the blood is continually streaming
through the kidneys to be filtered. But when the kidneys are
weak or diseased, they begin to lose their power of filtering
the blood. Then the watery waste left in the blood begins to
spread disease to all parts of the body.
The patient feels unnaturally drowsy and heavy, and
grows irritable and miserable. The uric acid and urea begin
to settle in the muscles and joints, causing the stiffness and
pain of rheumatism. The swellings of dropsy appear; the
heart is affected ; there are pains in the back, and the hands
and feet are always cold.
Kidney disease is hard to cure because it so often reaches
a serious stage before it is found out. But if you take your
trouble in time, before the kidneys get too seriously involved
the disease may be permanently cured. At the first appear-
ance of any of the above symptoms, the patient should com-
mence with a thorough course of Doan’s Backache Kidney
Pills, which act upon the kidneys and bladder like laxative
medicines act upon the bowels. The pills should be persevered
with until every sign of kidney weakness has disappeared, for
as long as the least trace remains a relapse is always to be feared.
Sydney People Testify.
Two Lasting Cures .
Mr. W. James, A’Bec-kett Street, Gran-
ville, says: “I strained my back when I
was quite a lad, and ever since I have
suffered greatly from backache. I tried
all kinds of remedies, but only with tem-
porary relief. My work used to be very
laborious, and I have had to leave it at
times on account of the intense pain.
However, Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills
cured the backache and strengthened
my back. I always tell friends who
suffer from bad backs to try Doan’s Back-
ache Kidney Pills; they are certain to
give relief. It is two years since I used
the pills, so my cure has been well
tested.”
Mr. James confirms his previous state-
ment two years later and says: “I am
still free of the torture of backache, and
have been since Doan’s Backache Kidney
Pills cured me four years ago.”
I Mrs. S. May, 48 Newland Street, Wav-
! e yley Street, Sydney, says: “It is now
13 years since I told you that Doan’s
Backache Kidney Pills had cured me of
backache and rheumatism, and give you
permission to publish this fact for the
benefit of other sufferers. I can say now
that my cure was a perfect one, and I
have been well all that time. I had con-
tracted a severe chill across the loins, and
for a couple of years suffered with lum-
bago-like pains in the small of my back.
I also had a touch of rheumatism. But
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills cured me
13 years ago, and I am still quite free of
every symptom of kidney complaint. I
have recommended this great kidney
remedy to numbers of sufferers, and they
all endorse my good opinion of it.”
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills are sold by all Chemists and Storekeepers at
2s. 9d. per bottle (six bottles 15s. 3d.) ; or posted on receipt of price by Foster-
McClellan Co., 76 Pitt Street, Sydney.

Backache Kidney Pills
‘lso go, ole fellar,” I answered. “Can’t
laugh, can’t hold ’em, too blazing hot—want
a — on^y to wa *k the part.”
You’re not paid for that yet,” he mut-
tered.
“What?” I said. “Do yop threaten cpe?
■ft s rank intimidation.” Like a wolf I
glared at him through my eyelets. He came
nearer. I sniffed at him. He had’ had a
drink. A drink, and he dared preach abstin-
ence to me, an unwilling knight of the blue
ribbon.
Just then a motor shot up to the kerb.
At sight of it the shopwalker dropped his
bounce and fell to shrill pleading. “They’re
the Best People,” he squealed. “For Gor’s
sake, put a spurt on, old man. Don’t let ’em
go next door. Yes? Yes! Beer afterwards
it you like, only hold' ’em till they’re in.”
He stole swiftly away' to rub his fat hands
and bow obsequiously in the doorway. Motor-
less, common folk made way obediently, and
the party advanced with some circumstance.
First a Juno, encased in motor wraps,
holding up a pierrot child. “Daddy
Christmas, darling,” she warbled, with
supreme _ condescension. “Clap hands at
him; which of his tickets will darling have?”
Closer she came. For the first time I
was thankful for the safe if stinking cover
of my mask.
It was She. She who was once my love.
She who threw me over for a brewery. Be-
hind her waddled Avoirdupois, the brewer.
Meclianicallv as they smiled condescendingly
at my grotesqueries I pulled my string and
the mask broke into indecent mirth. The
pierrot prattled with joy. She too laughed,
sympathetic soul. Little she recked of the
thirsty ruin behind the pasteboard and the
glue. I ground my teeth and cussed, shook
my fist at the brewer; but he, silly bounder,
took it as festive by-play. Ah, gods, thus to
torture a man! Love flown. Liquor lost,
for the blue ribbon.
In my agony I trod upon the fairy and
broke a jingling “wind-bell.” Then she
sailed past me. Final insult, she was leav-
ing the window, she was going to the clown
next door. Her barrel of a husband, his
pockets stuffed with notes, rolled on in her
wake.
The shopwalker blamed me. He started
to “rouse.” I clutched him. “Gimme a
drink,” I implored; “a sawft, water, cold
tea, anything.”
He looked at me. He smelt my goats’-
hair beard. Pity was born in his slanty
eyes, but born too late. He had indeed
tried me too far. I took him by the throat.
He lost his dignity and was sore afraid.
The cheap-show public watched us in amaze.
Was this indeed pantomime, it asked, rub-
bing its eyes and jamming its nose against
the window. My enemy pleaded for mercy,
but I heeded him not. For down the street
came a lorry, laden with crates of Christmas
beer. I knew the lorry. Mick Macdonald
was driving the horse.
“Mac,” I bawled, throwing the shop-
walker into a lot of Japanese umbrellas.
“Mac, Mac.”
He heard not my anguished bellow. His
brake was on, and its screeching drowned
all other sounds.
Serene, content, all unconscious of a
friend in dire need, Mac and his jingling
cargo passed by.
Then I lost control of myself. Turning,
with one flourish I demolished the Christmas
tree.
I leaped from the window into the shop,
blazed a track through Toyland. The dummy
in the cheap bathing-suit barred the way.
I gave him what he had been looking for all
day; one between his glassy eyes, and down
he went.
I rushed through the shop. Startled girl
assistants scuttled behind counters, while
heads of departments put up their eyeglasses.
A crowd opening before my onrush, closing
in after me. followed me hotly to the
manager’s office.
The manager was there with some share-
holders, drinking iced claret. On a desk
stood a glass of liquor. I seized it. “Put
that down, sir,” thundered an over-collared
man. I needed no second invitation. I did.
Then I 'tore off my red robe and jammed the
mask on tc the manager’s ears. I made a
present of the goats’-hair beard to a duke in
spats.
Then I fled through “the boots” and “the

Little Bourke-street and freedom.. Thence
to the little pub at the corner where, all
invitingly, stood Mick Macdonald and his

After my flight up Little Bourke-street a
scrap of blue ribbon rose languidly upon the
wind, soared a moment, then dropped
pathetically into the dingy gutterway.
WEEROONA.
Our Post Office.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
are dull in our post office this
morning. But, then, things are always
dull in our post office. There is a
staff of four, and the daily mail averages
10 letters. You can’t get much work or
excitement out of 10 letters, and the result
is the day goes so slowly that you would
think the clock had been dipped in treacle.
Some days things are so quiet that I think
I must be dead. My favorite roost when
I’m doing nothing (I’m always doing
nothing) is next to the empty safe, and op-
posite the file where we keep the exciting
notices about mails we never help to make
up for places we never hope to see. The
Deputy P.M.G.’s name at the foot of num-
berless notices fascinates me, and I have
often thought of sending him an insulting
letter about nothing, and so getting myself
gradually thrown out of the Department
and out of this hole. (Perhaps, though,
they would only pigeonhole it, or appoint
a Royal Commission to inquire into me!)
There is no particular reason why I should
stay here, for I am not married and don’t
wish to be. My salary is absurd, and I
hate everybody in the place—including, of
course, both messengers and the Hag who
is supposed to attend to the counter. (She
isn’t really a Hag, but she will be if she
stays. And the way she does her hair an-
noys me.) They are decent enough in their
way, and not ruder to me than they have a
right to be. (Did I mention that I was the
postmaster? Well, X am! I am also—if
it interests you—43 years old, deaf in one
ear, and going bald on top. But X don’t
suppose such personal details will interest
you. They hardly interest me, now.)
The trouble with this office is that nobody
has anything to do. We are sick of the
sight of one another. I don’t know exactly
how sick the other three are of me, but I
am sick enough of them to hate their names
on pay vouchers. If the Government could
only see us four loafers rotting in idleness
we might get healthily sacked, and so save
our souls by doing real work in some place
that isn t dead. I have thought of writing
an anonymous letter to the Department in-
forming the official head that neither I nor
my assistants have anything to do—in fact,
that the strains of a mouth-organ played
by the IJ.M.1 J .M. can be heard issuing from the
office at any hour of the day.. (By the way,
1 commandeered that mouth-organ from
young Jim, the junior messenger, and a
d —d fine fuss he made about it. You’d
never think I was the postmaster, the way
that kid talks to me.) But I’ve never cor-
nered sufficient energy to write that letter.
It seems to have fallen through, like my
scheme for starting a night-school and edu-
cating the grandfathers of the hamlet, so
that they could write letters for me to
stamp and bag. That was the Grand Idea
1 had when 1 came here first, full of en-
thusiasm—comparatively full, that is. I
suppose I must have been slow and depart-
mentally d —d, or I would never have been
sent here (Out, you brute! Where’s
that ledger? Bang! ! Oh, well, it
can stay there till that kid comes in. I
told him to leave some stones handy for
throwing at the hens! Why that woman
doesn’t keep the rotten things in her own
house ! .)
Two o’clock still! D—n it, it was two
o clock half an hour ago!. .. .Young Jim
should be back by now. Of course there’s
no use in coming a dashed thing
to do, and the sight of him cutting the
counter drives me mad. I hate, too, the
way his ears stick out. And he has a
cursed habit of whistling through his teeth.
I can’t play the mouth-organ while anyone
is whistling. But that kid should put in
an appearance now and again, if only out
of respect to me. (After all, I am the
postmaster!) Suppose someone got an-
noyed with the office and wrote the De-
partment that the messenger helped people
to kill pigs in office hours? Why, the boy
might be sacked. It would be the making
of him, of course, but look at the disgrace
of it. And I would have to write pages of
reports. And I hate writing reports—
especially since that blessed calf chewed up
all the dictionary between C and M. I
can’t trust my spelling since I’ve been here,
and with two-thirds of the dictionary eaten,
report-writing is too dangerous. They might
say down there that I wasn’t educated!
Yes, I’ll have to have a word with that kid.
He’s getting too cheeky, anyhow. It’s an
understood thing that the telegrams are to be
delivered in person by me. There is—or
there ought to be —some excitement hanging
to telegrams; and I guess, as P.M., I am
entitled to first call on any fun that’s going.
Yet that kid has been sneaking them under
my nose and rushing off with them. You
know, that’s too hot, altogether!
If there was a railway station here, we
could go down and meet the train, and 1
would have some inducement to put on my
boots at least once a day. (I think a P.M.
should put on his boots once in a while, if
only as an example to his staff.) But there
isn’t any line as yet. It’s just promised.
I don’t know how many politicians and Gov-
ernments have lied about it and given their
solemn assurances that they will get the
Transcontinental diverted, so as to link up
the place with Europe and the Old World
generally. (If I should want to go to
Europe to-morrow I would have to go all
the way to Sydney. Think of that! I’ve
tried to get indignant about it, but can’t
manage it, somehow.) On Sundays the
oldest inhabitants get up on the crags like
goats and indicate exactly to one another
where the overland express will come
whistling out of Bodger’s Gully and swoop
on the town; then how it will skate out
again in a sort of screaming curve, and rush
up Death Adder Hill straight at Europe
and South America and other places. Yet
these same old men got hysterical when, the
other day, a partly-burst motor of the cheap-
est sort came crawling down the road that,
for some mysterious reason, leads to this
blot on the map. It would never have
come, only the goggled incompetent in charge
had lost his way. But, busted as he was,
he was so annoyed at arriving at all that
he tried to insult me by saying that it was
the deadest hole he had ever struck in his
life. When I asked him if he didn’t want
to telegraph home, or something of that
sort, he thought I was trying to insult him
back, and told me to go to H—l. (I didn’t
have my boots on at the time, so I guess
he didn’t know I was the postmaster.) He
got his motor going soon afterwards, and
puffed out of the town in the opposite direc-
tion, amidst the cheers of the grateful popu-
lace. I used to walk miles down that road
when I first came here. But the drawback
about walking out of this place is that, un-
less you can think of something else,'you’ve
got to turn round and walk back. There
is no reason, of course, why people should
come back, but they do. Those who move
out, that is. After a while, you find it
easier to stay still and go without boots.
(To tell you the honest truth, I don’t know
exactly where my boots are. I have an
idea I lent them to Harry, the senior mes-
senger, last week. When the horse-faced
galoot comes back from helping the Hag to
make jam I’ll ask him. Next time he wants
to go and see a girl he can borrow somebody
else’s boots.)
But, slack as we are here, I manage to
keep this office from going to the dogs alto-
gether. When young McCocky came in yes-
terday and wanted me to take a kangaroo-
rat in exchange for three stamps, I said
• N ° !’ , J don,t care if there ** a row about
it. While I m here I’ll see that the place
keeps up to a certain standard.
Ah, well! We’ll be all right when we get
the Transcontinental!... .D—n it! it must
be more than five past two! Where’s
that mouth-organ!
