It only took about 5000° F to
'weld' this meteorite into shape.
That's the temperature reached by
meteorites, missiles and machines entering
our atmosphere. But let's get down to earth.
Arc welding requires a lot more heat.
Around 10,000°F. And it's a lot more
convenient. Arc welding has modernized
thought and action. See how it has caused
changes in design and manufacture in every
phase of engineering. Today's oil finds, for
instance, are being stored in tanks of all-
welded construction. Pipelines and ships,
bridges and automobiles EMF arc
welding makes it happen. Improved EMF
arc welding electrodes are also on the job.
In giant manufacturing plants and small
factories... used by tradesmen and handy-
men. With new metals and new techniques
appearing every day, we are engaged in a
continual programme of testing and
research. And if ever the day comes that
some new process replaces arc welding
... you'll hear about it first from us.

MORE PLAY
ALTHOUGH Customs officials in
Canberra still thumb through an
advance copy of each issue of “Play-
boy,” that prototype of all the girlie
glossies, to decide whether to allow it
on the newsstands crowded with its
imitators, these days they seem to be
less disapproving of what they find.
This year only the April issue has failed
to get through, the best result for the
importers since the magazine was
banned in 1963. The thaw seemed to
begin with the release of the September
issue last year. October and November
w'ere miss-hits, then the December issue,
containing 1920 Norman Lindsay
nudes, served up with typical “Play-
boy” gloss as “Art Nouveau Erotica,”
got through.
FAME AT LAST
THE TELEVISION AWARD at this
year’s Henry Lawson Festival has been
won by the ABC program “This Day
Tonight.” The Festival, we are told by
a handout, will be opened by Mr. Bill
Peach, the well-known radio person-
ality.
BRIEF HISTORY
WHILE MAX ADRIAN, the British
actor, is presenting his theatrical por-
trait of Shaw at the Independent
Theatre, Sydney, actor Rob Inglis is
offering an interesting variation on the
art of the one-man show at another
Sydney theatre.
Adrian’s evening with G.B.S. is a
leisurely, discursive business. Inglis’
show, on the other hand, is a study in
compression — a potted history of
Australia, put together for the lunch-
time audiences at the AMP Theatre.
Inglis, whose contemporary winter
headgear, a sheepskin cap a la Khrush-
chev, makes a nice contrast with the
Victorian top hat he wears in the
show, is an ebullient and ubiquitous
figure on the Australian theatrical
scene. He played Iago to Peter
O’Shaughnessy’s Othello late last year,
and toured the U.S. with his first one-
man show, “The Canterbury Tales.”
He presented his current program,
“Men Who Shaped Australia for Better
Or Worse,” at the Adelaide Festival,
and it looks as if he’ll be living with
it for some time to come, since he’s
expanding it for a country tour later
this year.
At present, the show spans the years
between 1850 and 1900, but for the
tour he’ll be updating it by another
50 years an interesting exercise in
editing. “I spent four months prepar-
ing the show I’m doing now. There
are lots of differences in the early
documents. Each politician has told the
story his way, and I’ve set them off
against one another.”
He has also found that 60 years hasn’t
made so much difference to some of
the issues which added up to con-
troversy round the turn of the century.
“Before I did the show in Adelaide, I
stuck in some stuff about Sir Henry
Parkes and electoral reform stuff
I probably would have left out if it
hadn’t been for the South Australian
elections and I was amazed at the
response. Some of the audience started
clapping, others started shushing the
clappers it really got people going.
“And the characters are so great.
W. C. Wentworth, for instance you
have a reaction to just about everything
he ever did. You either approve
strongly or disapprove just as strongly.”
Inglis made his debut as an artist of
the one-man show in London, where
Rob Inglis. .. re-creating our past
he was one of the cast of the musical
“Oliver!” The play had been running
for some time, he was bored and was
beginning to feel he’d like to “speak
some lines I wanted to speak.” Chaucer
interested him and he evolved his own
version of “The Canterbury Tales.”
He toured the U.K. with it, took it
to Europe, and finally returned to Aus-
tralia. Here, he’s done performances
of “The Canterbury Tales” both in
theatres and in schools.
“Taking it to the U.S. was a great
experience I spent three weeks
there, doing the show in universities. It
meant a tremendous amount of travel-
ling I did the show in Texas one
day, and I had to get to Florida for
the next performance, so we did the
last part of the trip in a Cessna to-
get there on time.
“The audiences were good, too. The
only time there were any complications
at all was when one college asked me
to leave out “The Miller’s Tale” be-
cause they felt it was a little too bawdy.
This college is famous for the fact
that its lecturers have to use euphem-
isms for parts of the body during their
lectures. I put in a substitute story.
In any case, I change the program
according to the type of audience I’m
playing to, and according to the type
of theatre.
“In Malta, I did the show in an
opera house, where I was able to
spend half a day just getting the light-
ing right. But in other places I’ve just
had to make do with what’s been
available.”
Nevertheless, Inglis is firmly com-
mitted to the one-man show for a
while yet. “There’s Disraeli, Metter-
nick — all those guys,” he says with a
slightly fanatical gleam about the joys
to come.

Canon W. R. Ray, in Adelaide


lery in Sydney — 19 paintings on a
New Zealand theme. Done during the
past two years, they are abstracts in
deep earth colors.
Mrs. Docking went to live in New
Zealand three years ago, when her hus-
band, Gil, became director of the
Auckland City Gallery, and for the
first year she painted Australian
themes from the sketches she’d taken
with her, working only intermittently
on her first pencil drawings of New
Zealand. “I responded to the land-
scape fairly well, though. I’d grown
up in Warrnambool, in Victoria, which
is a volcanic part of Australia. It has
a volcanic plain which I’m told is
the second largest in the world, so it
wasn’t a typically Australian land-
scape.”
Mrs. Docking studied art in Mel-
bourne, but didn’t begin to paint seri-
ously until after her marriage in 1952,
When Gil Docking was put in charge
of a travelling art exhibition, and they
spent eight months travelling through
the country by caravan.
She held her first one-man show in
1961 in Sydney, then the Dockings
moved to Newcastle. “I think I was
lucky to move away then. Sydney is
more objective about art than Mel-
bourne, but at times — and the late
’fifties was one of them — there is
pressure on a painter to paint in a
certain way. At that time it was
abstraot expressionism.
“Now, it’s not so bad. There are a
number of avant-garde movements
deriving from New York, but, because
there are a number, people are more
objective and perceptive. They can
accept the artist who’s working quietly
on something that has nothing to do
with the avant-garde.”
Part of Mrs. Docking’s childhood
was spent in the Wimmera, scene of
Sidney Nolan’s first paintings, and she
has similarly vivid memories of it. “I
was the youngest of seven children,
and when we moved to the Wimmera
I was the only one of my brothers and
sisters left at home — most of them
were involved in the war — and I
was terribly lonely. I can remember
feeling a need to create something in
one of the art forms. I think the
loneliness of the country had a great
deal to do with the post-war need
rto create imagery. It was a land with
no culture — terrifying with droughts
— and people felt a tremendous lack
of security, which helped them respond
ib the arts.”
LEFT IN THE COLD
THE SUBMERGED SIXTH of our
affluent society stirs our conscience
every now and then through the
telly or the odd newspaper article or
the shock of seeing somebody rifling
through a dustbin. But in the arts
these days this salutary spectre rarely
rears its head, despite the chorus of
musicians, painters, and poets, who
insist that they belong to this
depressed group.
It is sad to reflect that this minority
may soon be composed of the naive
and the gentle rather than the gormless
or the tragic. Before the Banerjee
recital at the Sydney Conservatorium,
two 16-year-olds, rather waiflike and
in faded gear, tendered a one-dollar
note at the box office. The bloke
inside gently told them the price and
then added “each.” The boy stopped
looking through his pockets, picked up
his dollar and the odd change that he
had added, and wistfully led his little
girlfriend away.
SLIGHTLY COOL SWAMI
WE WERE admitted by Swami
Satyanand Saraswati himself, gabbed
in saffron robe — and a rather unex-
pected sight in suburban Sydney on
a chilly winter afternoon. It was the
home of Sydney’s resident yoga expert
Romia Blair, who was busy in the
kitchen preparing afternoon tea, of
which we were relieved to see the
Swami partake. Everybody seemed to
be wearing orange (the color of fire
and enlightenment) and we realised
our shoes should have joined the small
collection at the front door, as every-
one else was barefoot.
But the Swami, unperturbed, settled
himself cross-legged on the couch,
arranged his robe about his shoulders,
and explained that he was doing a
world tour, and that Australia was
included because it had more yoga
exponents than any other Western
nation.
He himself has been practising yoga
from the age of six, when it came to
him spontaneously. At 19 he decided
'to become a guru and he has now
completed yoga’s eight stages.
Unlike his countryman, the Maha-
rishi Yogi, smiles don’t seem to come
easily to the Swami, explainable per-
haps by the fact that he has ■ now left
all worldly attachment behind, in order
to achieve “complete cosmic awareness,”
“I live according to certain restric-
tions, but they are not restrictions,
because they come naturally to me.
I am purely vegetarian and I like it,
I want to be free from family life and
I am. As for the giving and taking
of love, I do this, but on a higher
and different level altogether.”
This year, the Swami added, stu-
dents from 20 countries had attended
the International Yoga Teachers’
Training Course, which he held at the
Bihar School of Yoga.
It seems there are “serious-minded”
people in the West ready to take the
vows of chastity, pure diet, and medi-
tation necessary for the higher pursuit
of yoga, but most settle for the “utility”
branch catering for “the common
man.” “For this branch of yoga, it
would be meaningless to shake off the
requirements of your life. To practise
yoga for physical fitness, it is neces-
sary to give half an hour a day to it.
To relax tensions, 15 or 20 minutes
extra.”

Melbourne
"DARLING, I LOVE
YOU," CRIED THE
BALD BISHOP
YOUR CORRESPONDENT arrived
'back from the city of churches, where
religion, tactfully, is almost kept out of
sight, to find Melbourne in a state of
religious ferment. Bishop Howell Witt,
on a visit from W.A., pointed out that
normally religion does not get much of
a run in Melburnian newspapers. In
Monday’s “Age” there were about seven
pages of football, but if one wanted to
discover what the Dean had said on
Sunday there was a little column some-
where on page 11.
The scene has changed incredibly:
admittedly religion is failing to beat
footy on a day-to-day coverage, but
never in the history of the colony has it
done so well. There have been occasions
when it has received at least as much
news as the match of the day.
The “Herald” front-paged the report
that there would be no action against
the two “rebel” priests, Rev. David
Pope and Rev. Peter Lane, and the
“Herald” printed the statement from
“Bishopscourt” that the Archbishop was
satisfied that the Rev. Pope and the Rev.
Lane could “with a clear conscience
repeat the creed and reaffirm the dec-
larations and promises made at the
ordination to the priesthood.”
Then, for the benefit of all, the
“Herald” ran the creed in full on its
front page. It has to be admitted it is
some time since the creed previously
made the front page in Melbourne.
“Lot’s Wife,” the Monash University
newspaper, also had something across
its front page: “God identikit here
at last . . . the Rev. David Pope-inspired
do-it-yourself kit which will enable you
to actually materialise your own con-
cept of God. This free and never-to-be-
repeated offer comes by courtesy of
‘Lot’s Wife’ in the interests of modern
theology. Simply cut out the features
according to your taste of revelation.
(Please resist the obvious temptation to
be frivolous.)”
Thereupon followed a page of as-
sorted appalling sets of eyes, noses,
mouths, hairstyles, and even a crown.
Immediately on return from Adelaide
your man hurried out to Monash, where
he inspected the modern Golgotha. The
site was splendid, right in the vast
Monash forum, not far from the Union
and not far from the Ming wing.
Following the so-called student cruci-
fixion, the university has been involved
in furious fence-mending. The students
have been on “Meet the Press,” there
have been discussions with Channel 2,
they have been on the women’s morning
programs, on the talk-backs, there have
been talks with the female writers, and
a full double-page spread, with pictures,
in the “Sun.” It appears that Monash

will appoint a full-time public relations
officer.
One wonders why a university needs
a PR. As one professor pointed out:
“The day the people of Melbourne have
a good opinion of Monash University
students I will know that it has ceased
to be a good university.”
But some talking around Golgotha
revealed these points. Dr. Sir Henry
has been very good to Monash, but now
relations have never been worse. When
they gave him that honorary Ph.D. they
were so terrified of student reaction the
ceremony had to take place at the Mel-
bourne Town Hall. This did not go
down well and now there’s the fear
that their Monash doctor could cut
down funds in the future.
Also, under the recent Licensing Act,
the universities had hoped to get liquor
licences for their student unions, which
are common enough in England. This
was rejected and among the reasons
given was this: Liberal MPs objected
to “recent incidents such as the mock
crucifixion and the collection of funds
for the Viet Cong.”
Also, the university image was so
bad it was becoming increasingly diffi-
cult for students to get vacation jobs,
and it was like the old days when
every ill was blamed on Ned Kelly
or Squizzy Taylor: every riot was a
Monash riot.
As for the students, they stated the
public had received the wrong idea on
the crucifixion and they resented the
“blatant inaccuracy” and “outrageously
colorful language” (“Lot’s Wife’s”
words) used in the original “Truth”
report. They resent, too, that Sir
Henry Bolte and other politicians used
the “Truth” report as their only evi-
dence when they discussed the matter
in Parliament.
But all this has made for a lovely
few weeks in the letters columns, and
it was very interesting. The first reac-
tion was that clearly Monash should
be razed, but after that most of the
letters were on the side of the stu-
dents, and it would appear that the
public is more broadminded than
Parliament.
“The cry for ‘blood’ by the noisy,
indignant segment of the community
in itself gives rise to a blasphemous
travesty of the Christian faith, which
preaches God’s word of grace and for-
giveness to all mankind.” Rev. C.
Chapman, Dromana.
“The only statement I have seen of
the students’ intentions indicated that
they wanted to show the primitive and
barbaric nature of Christ’s punishment.
If this is blasphemous intent, Easter
is a blasphemous festival.” Dennis
Douglas, Box Hill.
“I think a comparison with either
capital punishment or the aggression
in South Vietnam makes a ‘mock’
crucifixion seem a rather important
issue in Parliament. If any human
being like Christ were existent, no
doubt he, too, would be called a
‘long-hair’ ratbag instead of the ‘sup-
reme beggar’ or the ‘young and fear-
less’ prophet. However, nowadays,
crucifixions not being in vogue, the
only thing to do with a Christ is to
give him a nice hypocritical repri-
mand.” Lou Costelloe, Hon. Sec., Mon-
ash Tiddly-Winkers’ Association,
Brighton.
“The students responsible performed
an act which clearly offended a large
section of the community. Such activity
is another indication of the alienated
or isolated mentality of many students.
Surely these students are abusing the
privilege to pursue university studies
largely financed by the taxpayer.” S.
Bongiorno, S. Oakleigh.
But perhaps the best lines came in
an ABC-TV debate between Dr. Ste-
phen Murray Smith and Howell Witt,
Bishop of North Western Australia. A
young female student talked of terrible
plastic images one saw of Christ, but
now, when Monash turned on a cruci-
fixion that .was real and alive, why did
people object? Howell Witt, who des-
cribed himself as the “bald bishop from
the bush,” said: “Darling, I love you. I
couldn’t agree with you more. Every
year in Adelaide John Martin’s run a
Father Christmas procession which has
nothing at all to do with the birth of
Christ. It is the same here. The cruci-
fixion is for man, here today. It should
be alive. I couldn’t agree with you
more.”
The discussion is still going on, but
one feels for that new public-relations
man at Monash. The place has had such
astonishing publicity he will need to be
awfully good to keep it up.
OUT AND ABOUT
Daphne Guinness
THE TIME HAS COME
TO PUT SNOB APPEAL
INTO THE SAUSAGE
“THE SAUSAGE,” announces Bob
Mirrington in a pained voice, “is subject
to a great deal of comment and con-
troversy. Wouldn’t you say that was
right, John?” John Hodge says yeah,
it certainly is. The general and market-
ing managers of Presto Smallgoods,
dressed in regulation white overalls
with Presto embroidered tastefully on
the pocket, are slumped down behind
desks littered with sausage point-of-sale
material. It is 10.30 a.m. and they are
waiting for Harold to bring in a
plateful of hot frankfurts. A wedge of
bacon lies on one desk. It has been
there 24 hours and will stay another
24. They are testing it for color, which,
God willing, should stay pink.
“Yes,” says Mr. Mirrington, who
takes his sausages seriously-—he has been
in them 28 years —“people keep coming
up to me and asking where can they
buy a good sausage.” This doesn’t get
him down. As a matter of fact, he quite
enjoys the reaction of people at parties
when they say and what do you do?

Henry Perl on the selling counter which shifts 115,000lb. of sausages a week
at 4 a.m., in the meat grinder, then
through the tumbler, then it’s all kinda
mixed up with herbs, and it goes into
that machine and comes out 'the spout
where today it’s received by a boy in a
paisley jumper, who doubles up pro-
duction at Mr. Mirrington’s appearance.
Then it’s cooked, and around 6 a.m.
fresh, sparkling, new sausages are ready
for breakfast. Now this, says Mr. Mir-
rington, moved for the first time to
smile, this is the Salami Maturing
Room. He looks up at 60,000 slowly
maturing salamis and says every time
he does he thinks ha! a dollar a time.
Up in the storage room, Jack Adler,
who is to sausages what a chef is to a
restaurant, mixes up spices and sips
black tea. On the wall is a sign “NE
L'OPJ,” which is Hungarian for don’t
pinch the goods. Uncle Bela trundles
past, grunting. He always grunts, says
Mr. Mirrington, he’s an Olympic wrest-
ler. And Harold, at last, produces the
frankfurters . . .
“. . . . there are two good points about
the sausage,” continues Mr. Mirrington,
sinking his teeth into a non-colonial
genuine 9in. vienna frankfurt, “one is
convenience, plonk it under the grill and
serve it hot, or serve it up as cold cuts,
and, two, it’s a solid meal in itself.”
Sure, he eats them at home but er
no, Mrs. Mirrington’s not quite so keen.
He sneaks up on her twice a month with
sausage dinners, but he’s working on it.
“The thing is, we shift 115,0001 b. a
week of sausages, so we know people
like them. What we want is they
shouldn’t be ashamed of them.”
Actually, there is a feeling of excite-
ment in this heady, pungent atmosphere.
It has taken them six months, but fin-
ally, taking a line through the frankfurt
situation, they have produced what they
hope is the answer to the whole damn’d
frustrating affair: a choice Danish pork
sausage. Mr. Mirrington’s voice quivers.
He is launching it at a breakfast party
in Sydney this week, with lots of excit-
ing TV personalities and hot, crusty
rolls and coffee.
John Hodge says have you seen the
report? Mr. Mirrington picks it up,
reads it, and says as a matter of fact he’
hasn’t. The perfect Danish pork sausage
contains 96 percent pork. And someone
out there has put in 100 percent . . .
Sausages, he says. This is followed by a
long silence. Mr. Mirrington could
very nearly, but never does, split his
sides at their faces. And then, of course,
the sausage has been the source of
ribald humor since, well, since it was
invented. They once carried out a
:survey as to why this was so, and the
answer came back because people
thought the sausage —um —lower class.
“They thought it was a cheap way of
filling up : a hole, you know, anything
goes into a sausage. Even dogs,” says
John Hodge, who is more inclined to
joke about his calling. He has been in
it eight years.
Now, this survey was carried out
six years ago and what worries Mr.
Mirrington is that people still look down
on the ordinary banger, though that’s
a word he would rather not hear.
Colonial frankfurter and smallgoods
get his back up, too. A shocking choice
of words. Whoever picked colonial for
this thriving, thrusting Australia was
out of his mind. It’s all right for Fiji,
where things like that still count. He
has tried to think of another for small-
goods but cannot. However, the time
has come to put snob appeal into the
sausage. Kinda make it acceptable for
dinner parties.
Outside, 150 workers are hard at the
business of producing a range of 152
snobbier, upper-class sausages. The
Bloodwurst, the Csabai, the Clobassy,
the Schmier, the Dumpfwurst, the
Kransky, the Braunschweiger, the
Zwiebel, and so on. Even these have
their problems. People can’t pronounce
them. And they’re too shy to point.
Mr. Mirrington sighs. He will have to
organise a crash know-your-sausage
course for the public. He has already
produced some full-color leaflets guid-
ing them to tastier, more exciting eat-
ing, but deep down he thinks something
more educational will be necessary.
Anyway, the Foreign Legion based in
Tahiti know their sausages, they’ve
placed an order for 3000 Presswurst.
They know them in Malaysia, Hong
Kong, Kuala Lumpur, and Noumea,
too. Perhaps they’re better at languages.
Mi'. Mirrington sloshes on round the
factory. Here’s where the sausage starts


The sort of budget
we can expect
COMMENT
BY
ALAN
REID
THE NEXT Commonwealth Budget
is due to be brought down in August
by Treasurer William McMahon. Its
making is not going to be easy, though
for political rather than exclusively
economic reasons.
On one hand, there will be Prime
Minister John Gorton and the more
politically minded of his Cabinet
colleagues. Raised to his present
eminence because of the death of his
predecessor Harold Holt, Gorton is a
selected not an elected Prime Minister.
Though he is keeping his mind flexible
on the issue of whether or not to hold
earlier general elections, formally due
toward the end of 1969, to take
advantage of the present disorder in the
ranks of his Labor opposition, the
temptation to become a Prime Minister
in his own right and with the backing
of the electorate as early as possible
must be strong.
This temptation is reinforced by the
view of a section of his Cabinet which
believes that the time to strike elector-
ally is this year, not 1969. They argue
that strange things happen in politics—
that though Labor at the moment seems
in such disorder that it looks almost
impossible for it to regain cohesiveness
within the months between now and the
end of 1969, things change. The miracle
could happen. Despite the troubles in
which Opposition Leader Gough
Whitlam is involved with the ALP
Federal machine, and particularly its
Victorian, Queensland, and Western
Australian branches, something could
happen and Whitlam could emerge as
the Leader of a united, cohesive Party
that gave the outward appearance of a
possible alternative government.
Within this contest, a section of the
Ministry, including possibly Gorton
himself, will be looking for a Budget
which will not ignore electoral consid-
erations in case political factors make
an election desirable at a date earlier
than the scheduled late 1969.
Superimposed on top of that are the
quite laudable ambitions of individual
Ministers to emerge as great reformers
or innovators. Social Services Minister
William Wentworth is an example.
Raised by Gorton to the Ministry after
17 years of frustration on the Govern-
ment’s back bench, Wentworth wants
to add to such monuments as he already
has to his credit (such as the standard-
gauge railway line between Sydney and
Melbourne) further historical signposts
to announce “Billy Wentworth operated
here.”
Wentworth has worked out quite
radical proposals not only for the
advancement of Aborigines, for whose
welfare he now carries Ministerial
responsibility, but for the improvement
of social services, generally. But these
things cost big money.
On the other side are the conven-
tional economists, of which the Treasury
has its share. For the average Aus-
tralian (including McMahon) the
breaking of the drought with its pledge
of higher incomes for primary pro-
ducers in the coming year represented
good fortune. The Commonwealth has
already paid out about $30,000,000 in
drought relief. Until the rains came
it looked as though another $20,000,000
would be needed to provide further
aid for drought victims. And this
against a background of reduced
primary incomes and declining overseas
sales of primary products.
But for the conventional economists
the breaking of the drought was the
solution of only one problem, that of
the primary producer. They could see
other problems starting to emerge with
the primary producers again likely to
have spending money in their pockets.
Anticipating inflation, they lean to-
warn raising taxation to reduce or can-
cel out the heavy Budget deficit which
they anticipate will emerge when Com-
monwealth accounts close on June 30.
McMahon will be under two opposed
pressures. The first will be from his
politically minded colleagues whose pre-
deliction will be toward a Budget that
takes account of electoral considera-
tions. The second will be the cautious
Treasury pressure which is more in-
clined to be gloomy about the prospects
of inflation than the prospects of
ordered development.
Personally, I believe that the choice
will be made somewhere between the
two. With the relative stability in
price levels McMahon has been able to
achieve with his last two Budgets, the
Treasurer is not likely to be receptive
to any grandiose, electorally orientated
schemes for massive Government spend-
ing. But on the other hand with the
drought broken his receipts are likely
to be higher. Without risking stability,
he can maintain the tempo of con-
trolled, guarded expansion which has
enabled development to continue at a
quite spectacular rate over the past two
years. But he has his economic problems
also. Normally, Australia would expect
to spend between $70,000,000 and
$100,000,000 overseas on defence. This
year the figure will be $350,000,000
and next year will probably rise to
$450,000,000.
So far McMahon has been able to
contain expenditure, deal with the
drought, and still provide for expansion
within the framework of existing tax-
ation. With the political pressure oper-
ating and his defence overseas commit-
ments rising dramatically, 'he will be
tested to produce a Budget which keeps
taxation at its present level. It will be
interesting to see how he fares.
Making a hoax
of history
COMMENT
BY
"OBSERVER”
REVELATIONS about homosexuality
in Mr. Michael Holroyd’s recently pub-
lished life of Lytton Strachey have been
referred to in all the reviews of this
two-volume biography. But, apart from
odd bits of gossip, such as J. M. Keynes’
habit of pinching boyfriends from
Strachey, the full implications of what
Mr. Holroyd was writing about have
only now been stated in an article in
“Encounter” by Goronwy Rees.
Mr. Rees points out that “Blooms-
bury” such an influential force in so
many ways was very largely, in emo-
tional tone and climate, a homosexual
society. But not only Bloomsbury. Nor
only Cambridge. After recalling John
Betjeman’s recent cry on radio (“But
everybody was queer at Oxford in those
days!”) and allowing for its exaggera-
tion, Mr. Rees says: “It would be fair
to say that, as in Strachey’s Cambridge,
so in Oxford in the ’twenties and
’thirties homosexuality was, among
undergraduates and dons with preten-
sions to culture and a taste for the arts,
at once a fashion, a doctrine, and a
way of life . . . (that) exercised an in-
fluence which extended far beyond the
boundaries of the university ... In the
case of the universities it has in other
respects been taken for granted that un-
til very recent times, perhaps even still
today, the two older of them have had a
decisive influence in shaping the intellec-
tual, emotional, and social outlook of
the English governing class . . . But what
no one has said is, firstly, that between
the two World Wars the dominant tone
of the universities was deeply colored
by homosexuality. Secondly, that this
has had a significant effect on those who
received their higher education there,
an effect which continued long after
they had left the universities and when
they had come to positions of consider-
able power and influence. And, thirdly,
that the position occupied by such per-
sons in English life has given them a
distinctive and identifiable influence on
English society as a whole.”
Mr. Rees draws the correct con-

elusion from this. It is not just a giggle,
nor a cry of affront, nor an assumption
of sinister conspiracy. It is that much
of the biography and history of England
in the ’twenties and ’thirties has been
proved, in this respect, a hoax. It has
suppressed one striking feature of
influential society in England as it
seemed to those who were part of it,
so that what we read of this society
is, to this extent, false. This is true
not only of history but of novels.
There was no English Proust or Gide,
and Henry James fell down on the
job. Perhaps, as Mr. Rees suggests,
“the Wilde case, in 1890, gave a kind
of shock to English society from which
it has only recently begun to recover:
if one were a Marxist one would be
tempted to relate it to that other
traumatic experience when, in 1888,
German steel production first exceeded
Britain’s.” Whatever the case, it remains
true, as Mr. Rees says, “that in this
respect England’s writers have shown
less courage and honesty than her law-
yers, legislators, and social reformers.”
We can’t know what the significance
of the recent revelations is until more
is written. To quote Mr. Rees again:
“One does not wish to say that homo-
sexuals constitute a kind of Homintern
which secretly rules (or ruled) English
society, as the Mafia rules Sicily or
WASPS rule America. One would
simply like the facts in the case, pre-
sented in the same kind of way, and
with the same regard for truth, as we
have come to expect, in other matters,
of any historian, biographer, or
memoirist in whom we feel we can
place our trust. In this respect Mr.
Holroyd has set a notable example and
one hopes that others will follow. But
until they do one will have the uneasy
feeling that a significant stratum of
English social life is still to be
uncovered.”
The whole thing is one of those
examples of the lies history can tell.
Sometimes the things that are most
important to a society are those that
are most secret to it. In some cases
they become so self-evident that no
one bothers to write about them: in
other cases, as here, there is deliberate
suppression. The full story of political
decision, for example, is not usually
told. If all the participants in a political
decision remain silent, we never know
what really happened. If some of them
write of it later we distrust them, not
only because we suspect their intention
but because each of them himself knows
only his own part of it.
At least Strachey seems to have
•written frankly if privately of
himself. One can only regret, with Mr.
Rees, that he did not carry out a
project that, at the end of his life, he
lightly suggested. Having read Malin-
owski on the sexual life of the Trobriand
Islanders, Strachey said he felt much
inclined to devote himself to a similar
work on the sexual life of the English.
But he added that it would have to be
published in New Guinea.

Meet a lightweight steel that carries plenty of weight:
LY-TEN
Time was when increased strength
meant increased weight. But that was
before LY-TEN. Now, not only con-
tainers, but truck bodies, tractors, rail
wagons and dozens of other products
can be made lighter, stronger, far more
resistant to corrosion. Because LY-TEN
has better impact resistance, and
greater corrosion resistance. It can be
cold-worked on brake presses or any
other forming equipment, welded-
either to itself or other low-carbon
sheet steels. Get your weight down,
get LY-TEN.
Send for facts on LY-TEN now-they
could change your ideas on the uses
of sheet steel.

AUSTRALIA
The Indians brought
some new ideas
THREE EVENTS last week high-
lighted the rapidly changing context in
which Australia must define its defence
and foreign policies. They were:
Mr. Gorton’s visit to a “great and
powerful” ally, in the middle of an in-
tense debate about how and where to
apply that power and greatness.
A State Visit by the Indian Prime
Minister, Mrs. Gandhi, as part of a
tentative projection of Indian power
into South-East Asia.
A report that there are strong moves
for Japan to contribute to South-East
Asian security in the wake of British
withdrawal.
Mrs. Gandhi’s visit, the first to Aus-
tralia by an Indian Prime Minister,
was not merely an expression of
bilateral goodwill. The Indian Govern-
ment is feeling its way toward a South-
East Asian role. “We are a part of
South-East Asia, too,” members of Mrs.
Gandhi’s team kept saying. With
India’s annual economic-aid flow now
established at the highest possible level,
with relations of co-existence with
Pakistan being re-established, Indian
foreign-policy makers are looking more
intently at South-East Asia the area
of greatest international uncertainty.
“Indian foreign policy is shifting its
focus from west to east” was the
way one of those in Mrs. Gandhi’s
team expressed it. Others were not pre-
pared to be as blunt as that, but it is
clear that they see opportunities and
challenges in Britain’s withdrawal and
in the prospect of a lessened U.S.
presence, post-Vietnam.
So far, they are only talking safe,
non-military-type involvement in South-
East Asia: trade, aid, technical assist-
ance, the development of a greater sense
of regionality, exchanges of ideas and
information at all levels. They talk
specifically of the need to cultivate a
tripod Indian - Australian - Japanese
framework within which the smaller
countries of South-East Asia can
achieve greater cohesion and progress.
ASPAC, they feel, is too North-East
Asian in orientation, ASEAN too lack-
ing in economic power to amount to
anything much. Although they do not
yet propose any new formal organisa-
tion, they foresee themselves with Aus-
tralia and Japan as the other two great
powers of non-Communist Asia making
a concerted effort to draw together to-
ward greater co-operation the smaller
countries of the region. They specify
Ceylon, Malaysia, Singapore, Philip-
pines, Indonesia as the obvious candi-
dates for membership of this new com-
munity. They would hope to draw in
Pakistan, Burma, and Cambodia, and,
after a Vietnam settlement, Indo-
China. About Taiwan and Korea, they
are undecided. That might be too much
for the Russians to stomach.
They argue, with some plausibility,
that Australia, India, and Japan can
do more together than separately. The
Japanese, they point out, are regarded
with suspicion in much of South-East
Asia, because of their oppressive be-
haviour during World War 11, India
is regarded with much of the distaste
of China as the patron State of a com-
munal minority group of rapacious
traders, and Australians simply aren’t
established as full members of the
region yet.
Yet, combining the strengths of the
three—Japan’s industrial power, India’s
administrative skills, and Australia’s
agricultural know-how - these weak-
nesses can be overcome.
Several of India’s top journalists
accompanied the Prime Minister and
they saw great significance in her refer-
ence to the need for international guar-
antees for the South-East Asian area.
It was, they said, a departure from pre-
vious Indian Government statements
which had stressed non-interference by
outsiders. Mrs. Gandhi and her officials
refused to be drawn on the significance
or concrete meaning of the guarantees
suggestion, but it would seem they are
taking one small step toward support
for some sort of mutual security
arrangement for South-East Asia. This
view is reinforced slightly by Mrs.
Gandhi’s repeated point that her policy
of non-alignment precludes treaty
arrangements with the great powers,
leaving the way open for such arrange-
ments with the ungreat. But there is
a large measure of ambivalence in
Indian attitudes.
Having mentioned international
guarantees to South-East Asia, Mrs.
Gandhi immediately returned to the
old Nehru liberal theme that “Nation-
alism and economic development are
the best guarantee against subversive
pressures from outside.” And while
India is always coldly realistic about
the key role of military power in its
own self-defence, it continues to speak
of the futility of others seeking security
through military preparedness and co-
operation.
Mrs. Gandhi and her team also took
the opportunity to do some business for
India while in Australia. Their prin-
cipal request was that India be given
a better deal in trade. They claimed
that Australian administration of its
tariff and dumping regulations gives
the Chinese a quite unfair advantage in
their drive to sell manufactured exports
on the Australian market. They be-
lieve that in return for Chinese pur-
chases of Australian wheat, our Trade
and Customs officials are tending to
treat the Chinese very leniently in a
number of cases where their manufac-
tured goods should be hit for “dump-
ing” at below-cost prices. They claim
that a stricter application of Australian
dumping regulations would give them
a chance to compete on an equal basis
Mrs. Gandhi in Canberra last week ...
“shifting focus "
with the Chinese in the sale of manu-
factured goods on the Australian
market.
They are also keen that Australia
harness its agricultural research effort
more closely to the problems of tropical
agriculture. They want to get Australian
help in improving tropical pastures for
enlarged milk and meat production,
and think we could help them in their
search for higher-yielding cereal
strains.
With some subtle encouragement,
Mrs. Gandhi laid great emphasis in
her public speeches on these aspects of
Indian policy which are most closely
aligned with Gorton policy. She spoke


strongly against the Nuclear-Non-
Proliferation Treaty, much to the
embarrassment of Mr. Whitlam at the
Parliamentary luncheon. And at her
Press conference she said it was her
country’s view that Singapore and
Malaysia could look after themselves
militarily after Britain’s withdrawal.
However tentative and ambivalent
these Indian moves toward a role in
South-East Asia, they must be recog-
nised as the growth of a new factor in
a much more complex regional environ-
ment. If India by itself is no great force,
with the Russians, to whom it is closely
allied, it can grow into a power of some
significance.
It was pointed out last week in Can-
berra that India’s move into South-
East Asia comes immediately after an
intense series of Russo-Indian talks,
including two visits to India by Rus-
sian Premier Kosygin.
Japan's plans
From the other end of the Asian arc
Japan there is a highly significant
report of new thinking and planning for
South-East Asian defence. The presti-
gious monthly journal the “Oriental
Economist,” in its April issue, devotes
a long article to a series of revelations
about Japanese Defence Agency plan-
ning for South-East Asia. The Tokyo-
based publication spells out tentative
Defence Agency plans for Australian-
Japanese naval co-operation:
“The withdrawal of British troops
(and naval strength) from Asia leaves
the areas south of the Strait of Malacca
defenceless. It is understood that the
Defence Agency is considering the feas-
ibility of concluding a treaty arrange-
ment with Australia to define the
defence areas for the two countries.
According to this blueprint, the Defence
Agency plans to assign Japan maritime
defence operations in areas up to the
Strait of Malacca and Australia with
those in the Lombok Strait and the
Arafura Sea.” It then says bluntly that
the Japanese defence sphere of influence
“is bound to be extended to the Strait
of Malacca.
“Political conditions in areas linking
South Korea, the Philippines, and the
Indo-China peninsula are still extremely
unstable. The same is the case with the
Middle East. Under the circumstances,
how to protect Japan’s economic inter-
ests in these areas naturally becomes an
important problem.”
It proceeds to point out that Japanese
thinking is that the Americans are
unlikely to replace the British as an
influence for stability in Malaysia-
Singapore. Ninety percent of Japanese
crude oil comes through the Strait of
Malacca, it points out. And other essen-
tial raw materials come from South-
East Asia and Australia.
“The maritime staff office of the
Defence Agency is reported to have
made a blueprint of what may be
called the ‘Malacca defence schedule.’
This schedule is understood to be con-
nected with a plan to have the Maritime
Self-Defence Force take charge of
defence in areas linking Japan with the
Strait of Malacca.
“Nuclear-powered submarines and
anti-submarine helicopter-earners are
being considered for the naval defence
of South-East Asia. A project to con-
struct helicopter-carriers was planned
under the (present) third defence pro-
gram, although it failed to materialise.
Instead a large escort-type ship . . .
will be constructed.” This, together
with a missile-carrying escort vessel,
will, according to the report, “greatly
strengthen the capacity for protection
of commercial vessels.”
In the next defence program, starting
in 1970, the Defence Agency plans to
equip the Japanese Navy with a range
of anti-submarine aircraft-carriers, heli-
copter-carriers, and large nuclear sub-
marines. These would be supported by
high-speed tankers and repair ships.
“All in all, both Government and
private circles are beginning to show
greater interest in the problem of guar-
anteeing the security in Asia as a
whole, along with the increasing num-
ber of Japanese enterprises advancing
into overseas markets.”
Evidently, immediately after the
Pueblo affair, the Japanese and Ameri-
can Governments agreed that conflict
in Korea would invoke the security
treaty between the two countries. The
Japanese would, under the UN banner,
join with the Americans in helping the
South Koreans repel any invasion from
the north.
Largely at American urging, the
Japanese are planning to build marine
and airmobile army groups, based on
helicopter, troop-transport planes,
and carrier-ships. At present Japan has
12 infantry divisions (100,000 soldiers)
but on iy a s i n gi e airmobile brigade
( 300 0). Further airmobile units would
b e d eve [ o p ec } based on Japanese trans-
port planes (Mitsubishi MU-12S) and
the latest American helicopters (the
Lockheed AH-56).
The .. or i e ntal Economist” says that

Okinawa would be regained on the
basis of an understanding that Japan
develop a Marine Corps. They are also
encouraging Japan to take over some
of the burden of providing hardware for
the armed forces of South-East Asian
countries.
The draft resisters
The handful who are hard to handle
DRAFT-DODGING looks likely to
develop into one of the Government’s
biggest political headaches. And if his
handling of the matter so far is any
indication of what is to come, Labor
Minister Leslie Bury might well ruin
his political career on it.
There was indeed some double-
edged irony in the fact that a plain-
clothed policeman (rather too well-
known to journalists, perhaps) mingled
with demonstrators last weekend in the
protest against amendments to the
National Service Act outside the Prime
Minister’s lodge in Canberra. He chose
to disguise himself with a placard read-
ing “Bury Bury.”
The Government has already had to
retreat on the family “pimping provi-
sions” and Cabinet is known to be
considering dropping sections requiring
universities to supply information on
the names and addresses of students
eligible for registration for National
Service.
So far, the campaign of the Draft
Resistance Movement (“formed not to
oppose conscription but to wreck it”)
and other peace and Vietnik groups
have had an amazingly successful start.
First, there is the question of whether
conscientious objection can be based on
sincere disapproval of the Vietnam War
as such, or only on disapproval of war
in general. In two court cases it has
been held that objection to the Vietnam
War is sufficient grounds for exemption
from National Service, though in many-
other courts it has been ruled that it
is not, and that mere Vietnam-objectors
must go into the Army or into jail.
This legal anomaly persists. The Gov-
ernment does nothing in its latest
National Service amendments to try to
settle it one way or the other. And so
the draft-resistance campaigners con-
tinue to have a great issue to hang
their protests on.
That is one matter the Government
has failed to face up to. Another area
in which it appears to 'be dodging is
in the prosecution of non-registrants. A
Sit-down outside The Lodge


number of the students who demon-
strated outside the Prime Minister’s
Lodge in Canberra claim that they have
intimidated the Government. They
have written formal letters to the De-
partment of Labor saying that they
will not register, and that beyond a
warning no action has been taken.
For instance, Mr. Jonathan Hicks, a
Melbourne student who described him-
self as a pacifist, told The Bulletin that
he wrote to the Department on Janu-
ary 28, and received a letter on Febru-
ary 18, warning him of the two-year
jail penalty for not registering for
National Service. He wrote back tell-
ing the Department he intended to
persist in refusing to register and was
prepared to face the consequences. No
action has been taken against him. He
claims he knows of dozens of others
who are in a similar position. Miss
Vivian Abrahams, secretary of the Aus-
tralian Pacifists Society, has the names
of 16 of her members who appear to
have successfully intimidated the
Department in the same way.
The movement is, of course, gaining
ground with these claims, and even
makes the point that an injustice is
being done to the unorganised and non-
protesting Vietnam-objectors.
The Government has not been especi-
ally convincing in its attempts to dis-
credit the demonstrators. In their
statements in Parliament, Mr. Snedden
and Mr. Bowen said that three demon-
strations in Canberra by unionists,
secondary-school students, and by draft
resisters were “all part of a planned
operation.”
The Attorney-General presented evi-
dence of Communist Party and inter-
national encouragement of anti-Vietnam
protest. A trade union and high-school
students’ trip to Canberra did appear
to be standard Communist-front opera-
tions, with known Communists to the
fore in their organisation. But the third
protest demonstration, which the Gov-
ernment bracketed with these the
sit-down against amendments to the
National Service Act was less clearly
Communist-organised.
In fact, it was not really organised
by anyone in the event, because there
was a strong disagreement outside the
Prime Minister’s very gates as to the
tactics which should be employed. The
march-up was conducted by Whitlamite
secretary of the ALP’s Young Labor
Association, Colin Benjamin. He had
moved in heavily after hearing that
there were groups wanting a confron-
tation with the police. At the site,
moderates (Whitlamites, pacifists, and
Communists) urged caution and re-
spect for police instructions and siqce
they were armed with megaphones they
had the upper hand. The militants
(anarchists, Trotskyists, and Peking-
liners) yelled abuse at the leadership:
■“Scabs,” “Petty bureaucrats,” “Revision-
ists” and the act of civil disobedience
in blocking traffic by sitting on the
road was led not by the organisers of
the demonstration but by one of those
who had been interrupting their speech:
a Mr. Michael Hyde. A Monash Labor
Club member, he led the sitdown by
seizing a Viet Cong flag, dashing on to
the road yelling for supporters to follow
him. He was quickly joined by Mr.
Bob Gould, a Sydney protest leader
who regards the Communist Party as
bourgeois and gutless. The only well-
known Party personality, Mr. Ralph
Gibson, stood quietly on the side, and
an official of the Waterside Workers’
Federation grabbed the megaphone, urg-
ing the sit-downers to obey police in-
structions.
Only the intelligently restrained but
firm behaviour of the Canberra Police
prevented the militants from getting
the violence they wanted. They did,
however, get 67 arrests and fined $lO
a head. And there is more to come.
Because 12 of them have publicly criti-
cised the remarks of the judge in pass-
ing sentence on them, claiming he was
partisan on the subject of the Vietnam
War. Many of the rest intend to refuse
to pay their $lO fines and to make the
Commonwealth extradite them to the
ACT and jail them. It appears that
draft resistance is out of the hands
of the Party and being carried along
by more militant characters.
Immigration
Ex parte policy
AUSTRALIA’S DICKENSIAN Ex-
ternal Territories Minister, Mr. C. E.
Barnes, did it again last week. With
Mrs. Gandhi arriving, accompanied by
an entourage of leading Indian officials
and journalists, he seized the headlines
with a pronouncement on immigration
policy. To the despair of both the
External Affairs and Immigration
Departments, within whose sphere this
policy lies, he made what they regarded
as a provocative and unnecessarily
harsh statement- —in answer to a ques-
tioner at a conference of mostly Asian
and African students.
The policy of excluding non-
Europeans would, he said, “remain vir-
tually unchanged” in the years ahead.
That is not at all the way the people
concerned with immigration policy see
the matter. For a start they say that
there is a continuous policy of careful
liberalisation. The number of non-
Europeans being admitted grows year
by year. And no one has ever ruled
out further liberalisation.
Mr. Barnes said that the policy was
“based on economics,” but he then went
on to say that the Government wanted
a “homogeneous” population and
wanted to avoid a situation similar to
that in America.
And to really confuse the Indian
visitors who want Australia to join with
them in co-operative efforts in Asia,
Mr. Barnes was reported as saying he
felt Australia was not part of Asia. It
was part of the South Pacific region
along with New Zealand.
Kangaroos
Controlled farming
A PROTESTING scream from the
RSPCA last week, after N.S.W. Lands
Minister Mr. Lewis talked of the day
when we will be raising kangaroos on
ranches and slaughtering them for meat
and fur a lot more than we do now,
might have been even more agonised
if RSPCA officials had known about a
recent luncheon when the Minister
tucked into a tasty “Kangaroo Strog-
anoff.”
He was a guest at the luncheon of a
large Sydney catering firm which is
eager to get kangaroo meat out of the
Lewis ... ’roo Stroganoff
pet-food rut and into smart restaur-
ants and wanted to demonstrate just
how attractive the culinary possibilities
of the roo are.
Mr. Lewis was duly convinced he
told The Bulletin last Friday “the dish
was very tasty, indeed.” He is equally
convinced that the RSPCA is misguided
in its fears that controlled farming
must lead to extermination of the
kangaroo. (“Sickening” and “shocking”
were the terms of RSPCA State Presi-
dent Mr. V. G. Jerabek after the
Minister’s first statement earlier in the
week that the Government was inter-
esting itself in kangaroo ranches.)
. “It is quite illogical to say that kan-
garoos are likely to become extinct if
we breed them in captivity. The oppo-
site is the truth,” the Minister said.
“You might as well say that because
of the way we are breeding merinos
they are likely to become extinct. Nor
would kangaroo-farming in any way
prevent us from taking further steps to
put big nature reservations and parks
aside for preservation of various types
of kangaroos.
“It is only emotionalism which sees
farming and conservation as being
inconsistent with one another. For
instance, wild duck were scarce this
year because of the drought, and
because I am interested in their con-

servation I have prohibited shooting
this season. I will not need to do so
when wild duck are plentiful again.
What about mink and beaver and
other animals which are bred for their
fur? There isn’t the same emotionalism
about them. Young lambs are appealing
animals, yet they are slaughtered. Young
cattle can be pretty attractive, too, and
pheasants, but people still eat them.”
Just how near or far off the day is
when we will be eating kangaroo is
related, in part, to scientific research
being conducted by a team from the
University of New South Wales, under
the head of the Zoology Department,
Professor G. B. Sharman, at Fowler’s
Gap, 80 miles north of Broken Hill.
Mr. Lewis gave the University a lease
over the property in 1965 for research
into grazing under arid conditions, and
one line of study by Prof. Sharman and
his students, who make regular trips
to Fowler’s Gap, has been into the
breeding cycle of kangaroos and euros.
It has been discovered that nature has
given the kangaroo a strange, inbuilt
method of surviving the sort of severe
drought conditions which prevail out
in the Western Division of N.S.W.,
where roo mobs are still very numerous.
They do not breed when there is no
food. But come the rains and fodder,
the embryo develops, and the joey
appears.
There has been other study on the
long-vexed question about whether
kangaroos eat sheep out of food a
question the oldtime pastoralists would
have answered in their own way, with-
out the aid of science. But it now
appears that kangaroos and sheep do
not eat exactly the same type of
herbage. With the world running short
of food, and the kangaroo offering a
richer source of protein than mutton
and equipped to survive drought con-
ditions which wipe out other stock,
kangaroo-farming begins to make sense
to some pastoralists. But the feasibility
of breeding kangaroos in captivity still
has to be demonstrated.
“I hope eventually to set up a pilot
scheme the nature of it would have
to be worked out by the experts—to
see whether this can be done,” Ex-
plained the Minister for Lands. “What
we learn from Fowler’s Gap will give
us lines to work on. Sheep and cattle
were once wild, and if we can handle
kangaroos, possibly they can be econ-
omically domesticated. Scientists tell us
they can breed them to improve the
quality of the fur, and increase the meat
weight.
Food and health regulations do not
prohibit kangaroo meat for human con-
sumption. The requirements are that
it be kept in separate refrigeration,
away from other meats and that it be
handled hygienically all the way down
the line.
So all in all, it seems that what the
RSPCA will continue to fear as the
kangaroos’ last round up, despite Mr.
Lewis and his scientists, is as far off as
the “Kangarooster” farms the “Diggers
in Blighty” used to boast of.
Aborigines
Prevailing?
THOSE WHO declare that “black
power” could not happen here should
perhaps note that dissident students and
Aboriginal “progressives” combined last
weekend in an assault on the methods
by which the State of Queensland con-
trols and “protects” its Aborigines.
Abschol, the Aboriginal Affairs De-
partment of the National Union of
University Students and publisher of
an angry newssheet, “Aboriginal Quart-
erly,” arranged the seminar at the
Queensland University.
The speakers were Aborigines Joe
McGuiness, Stan Davey, both avowed
enemies of the Queensland reserves
system; Kath Walker and Faith Band-
ler, who stressed “integration” as dis-
tinct from “assimilation”; supported by
one Queensland MLA, one trade
unionist, and one academic.
Their criticism is, at this moment,
less important than the fact that they
directed it firmly and unhesitatingly
at a State Government which is equally
determined to stonewall against its
critics, prevent its department officers
and Aboriginal wards from entering into
dialogues, and, if necessary, maintain
its rights to control its Aborigines.
The progressives realise that they
represent a trifling amount of pressure
against the stone wall, even with student
help. Queensland has everything on its
side: colonies of unprotesting Aborigines
in its reserve-towns; elected reserve
councils which send delegates to a
State council which yearly praises the
Government for its good works; the
declared support of Emeritus Professor
Elkin, who has striven to help the
Aborigines for 40 years past (but is
not aware, they say, of how quickly they
can win acceptance in the next ten);
and a community unlikely to be aroused
on this issue.
Against this they see encouragement
in coming reform of Aboriginal Affairs
in New South Wales; in favorable Press
articles and television documentaries
such as Cecil Holmes’ examination of
Northern Territories Aborigines last
week; in rare comments such as the
South Australian Bishop of Willochra’s
last week: “the whole policy governing
our treatment of native people needs
investigation.”
A feeling that “We will prevail” is
evident among Aboriginal progressives,
with the possibility of simmering anger
among younger Aborigines becoming
more likely each year if the progressive
minority decides what it wants
whether this is “integration” or “as-
similation” but continues to fail to
achieve it.

De Gaulle-and France
General de Gaulle is
passing into history
Everyday scene in Paris. This time it is Right-wing demonstrators
protesting against Left-wing demonstrations
From PATRICK SEALE and MAUREEN McCONVILLE
A NEW REVOLUTIONARY
POWER, born and grown to manhood
in three weeks, has brought to its knees
the most majestic government in
Europe. General de Gaulle still
battles pitifully on how long?
but Gaullism has been slaughtered like
a horse beneath him.
The General’s magic has been
stripped from him. His offer on Friday
night of a referendum has been almost
forgotten in the ghastly violence that
has flared across France. His future is
being decided in the most squalid fash-
ion in the streets. Born in violence ten
years ago, his rule seems to be going
down before the barricades, in the acrid
smoke of tear-gas.
Awaited with such anxiety, de
Gaulle’s brief speech was a profoundly
pathetic anti-climax. Neither the man
nor his text measured up to. the
moment. If the crisis of the past fort-
night means anything, it represents a
violent liberation of the French mind
from official control. De Gaulle could
think of nothing better than to a3k for
a renewal of his old sweeping man-
date. Shouts of astonished derision
greeted his speech, broadcast to the
demonstrators in the streets. Suddenly,
before everyone’s eyes, he seemed a
tired and bankrupt politician.
What is being decided in France is
not whether de Gaulle should go but
how he should go. The old bastions of
opposition —the great trade unions, the
Socialists, the Communist Party itself
all clamor for his departure, but
they want the transfer of power to be
effected by constitutional means. But
there are younger men who run faster
and hit harder.
With bewildering speed, these politi-
cal guerillas have been hurtled into
politics by an anonymous surge of
student unrest. By taking to the streets,
they have set themselves against every
organised political force in France. Both
Government and Opposition last week
tried desperately to contain them. Both
failed.
The guerillas have introduced a
violent, sinister, and unpredictable ele-
ment in French life, and no one at
this early stage can be sure what
French politics will look like when the
fighting dies away. What is certain is
that a revolutionary political force is
taking shape on the extreme Left which
makes the official French Communist
movement look as staid and unad-
venturous as a Victorian tea party.
This extremist movement is formid-
able for two main reasons. First,
because it cannot be clearly identified.
One or two tiny factions work at its
heart their leaders, due to the new
tell-all television of these revolutionary
days, are now better known than most
French politicians but the move-
tnent as a whole has no name, no
formal structure, and no detailed pro-
gram. It is difficult to get to grips with.
It is raw explosive power.
Second, it is strong because the
students by their revolt detonated a
massive unsuspected charge of Gallic
rebelliousness, crossing boundaries of
class and generation, and ranging over
the whole of French life. It is as if,
fired by the students’ example, French-
men everywhere cocked a snook at
their boss. Entrenched authority has
crumbled in schools, factories, hospi-
tals, farms, and professional bodies.
The notion—central to Gaullism —
that Daddy knows best has been spon-
taneously rejected, to be replaced by
a sort of delirious individualism. This
crisis of authority cannot be dismissed
as the work of a handful of agitators,
and thugs. The remarkable feature
of the week is that, in spite of the
enormous inconvenience to the public
of the breakdown in services, tempers
have remained cool. The pitched
battles in the streets have been watched
in a sort of eerie calm.
The public has taken sides. In some
indefinable way, the consensus of sup-
port, like a guardian angel, has moved
from de Gaulle to his young oppon-
ents. They may not keep it long,,
bourgeois self-preservation may reassert
itself, but for the moment they have it,
and for this reason cannot easily be put
down. ,
There is a traditional hostility in
France for the police—the hated flics.
The more fiercely the regime deploys
those truncheons and shiny black macs,
the more opposition hardens. On Wed-
nesday the Government, surviving a
vote of censure, regained a measure of
confidence. Police repression then
escalated. Terror bred counter-terror.
Daniel Cohn-Bendit, the student
leader, was last week banned from
France as an undesirable alien. The
protest was immediate. “We are all
aliens,” chanted the demonstrators.
“We are all German Jews,” young
Algerians were even heard to shout.
Cohn-Bendit’s chief supporters are a
highly organised and fanatically mili-
tant group , called the Jeunesse Com-
muniste Revolutionnaire (JCR) —a sort
of Trotskyist political commando, led
by Alain Krevine, a former history
teacher, now full-time agitator, and
still under 30.
The whole JCR strategy is to mount
short, sharp revolutionary operations to
jolt society, shock by shock, down the
road to Socialism. Across this path
stand the Communist Party and the
Communist-led unions. Last week JCR


French students hold a political
meeting in a Left Bank theatre
tactics were to stampede these cautious,
lumbering elephants by infecting the
younger workers with the virus of rebel-
lion. They want the students to set
an example of militancy which the
working class will eventually follow.
The irony is that these violent young
men have struck a chord of idealism
and morality.
The attempt to head off this
Trotskyist challenge has caused a grave
malaise inside the French CP, even the
threat of a split. From the moment
Cohn-Bendit raised his unruly red head,
the Communist Party has tried to cut
it off. But younger Party members
and some on the Central Committee
itself—are now violently critical of the
timid, blinkered way the Party has
kept him and the rebellious students
at arm’s length. In similar protest, a
leading Party member, Andre
Mgrjonet, resigned on Thursday as
economics adviser to the Communist-
dominated trade-union federation, the
CGT.
This sharp internal debate jeopar-
dises the painstaking efforts of
Waldeck-Rochet to lead the Commu-
nist Party out of the political wilderness
of the past 20 years into acceptance as
a respectable force in French politics.
The CP is a tightly organised and
tightly run party, which still causes a
shudder to run down a bourgeois spine.
It has a hard core of a quarter of a
million members, but pulls in over
five million votes at elections. Rochet,
bald, solid, speaking in a pronounced
Burgundy accent, pins his hopes of
power on an alliance with Francois
Mitterrand’s Socialist federation. But
he has had to force this popular front
policy on to the reluctant old guard
of his politburo. Now, on the same
point of policy, he has again come
under savage attack from the Left-wing
guerillas. His compromise with bour-
geois democracy is in danger.
This is no academic dispute between
obscure sects. It affects the whole issue
of an alternative government to de
Gaulle now a burning question. The
Some of the 40,000 striking workers at the Renault
factories listen to trade-union speakers
arrangement between Waldeck-Rochet
and Francois Mitterrand is at best a
flirtation, still far from a le ga 1
marriage. Mitterrand needs the Com-
munist votes to fcarry him to the
Presidency, but he has been extremely
careful not to commit himself to sharing
power with the Communists, should he
get there.
The Communists’ fear is that he will
ride to the Elysee Palace on their
votes, but then look’ to the centre for
his Govern'ment allies. Mitterrand, in
turn, fears that to share power with
the Communists might mean to be
gobbled up as the weaker partner.
Good-looking and a cool strategist,
Mitterrand has plenty of political sex
appeal, but he is a Wilson without a
party machine. The federation he leads
may one day coalesce into a unified
Labor movement. But at the moment
it includes, with some strain, Guy
Mollet and his somewhat fossilised
Socialist machine, the lonely, eminent
figure of Pierre Mendes-France, and
some 60 political debating societies all
over the country, just about the only
troops Mitterrand himself can
mobilise.
Both Communists and Socialists,
then, are divided and mutually sus-
picious. Little wonder that, with de
Gaulle’s regime tottering, they are re-
luctant to give it a push.
The behaviour of the Communists
has been fascinating to watch. From the
beginning of the crisis they have been
more concerned to crush the guerilla
challenge on their Left than to over-
throw M. Pompidou’s Government. The
CGT (Trade Union Federation)
paralysed the country by a' great wave
of strikes to wrest the initiative from
the student extremists. Georges Seguy,
the powerful CGT boss and politburo
member, locked his workers inside the
factories to protect them from the
revolution stalking outside. On Friday
the Party felt forced to match the
students’ demonstrations with a couple
of their own.
The students have made dear that
their object is to overthrow the Gov-
ernment, and in this cause they have
battled all night. The CGT does not
share these aims. Its immediate objec-
tive is the economic betterment of its
members. Far from overthrowing M.
Pompidou, it agreed to negotiate with
him and with the French employers’
federation.
But under intense pressure from the
guerillas, the Communists are being
driven, step by step, away from this
cautious position in the middle of the
road. They have not yet fought at
the barricades, but their public state-
ments denouncing de Gaulle’s referen-
dum and demanding his departure have
become so insistent as to be almost
indistinguishable from those of the
extremists.
This is the measure of the students’
triumph: they have shifted the whole
spectrum of French politics to the Left.
They have given people a taste for
direct extra - parliamentary action.
Unleashing a will for reform in every
aspect of French life, they have demon-
strated that violence can be a short cut
to the transformation of society. The
terrible djinn has been let out of the
bottle and it will take a lot of tuneful
piping to get him in again.
Of course, bourgeois society is far
from licked, even though the extreme
Right seems hardly to exist any more
(except for a handful of rowdies
gathered round Maitre Tixier-Yignan-
cour). But the conservative half of the
country, oddly silent during the crisis,
as if finding nothing to defend in de
Gaulle’s regime, will no doubt start
baying when opinion turns against
students—as it must if disorder con-
tinues much longer. The Gaullists
have this week formed a nation-wide
network of committees for the defence


French Prime Minister Georges Pompidou, who has been meeting
trade unions to discuss wage and other concessions
of the Republic, which are said to be
well armed.
The Government may well win a
skirmish or two, a few heads will roll
in a placatory Government reshuffle, an
attempt will be made to buy off the
union with a handsome, if inflationary,
package of higher wages, shorter work-
ing hours, and earlier retirement.
“Participation” by workers in manage-
ment will be the new magic slogan, the
Government will try to ride the tiger of
university reform.
The past three weeks have shown
that too much of a radical nature has
to be done in France for the General,
at 77, to be entrusted with its doing.
His chances of a “oui” at the refer-
endum on June 16—or indeed of its
being held at all in the present climate
of disorder —must be counted poor.
“L’Apres-Gaullisme” is almost upon us.
The General is passing into history.
Peace talks
Vietnam remains
the world key
ALTHOUGH the Vietnam peace talks
have been overshadowed by more
immediately dramatic events in Paris
itself, in Prague, the United States and
Saigon, yet, to an extraordinary extent,
the future of Vietnam remains a key
element in all these other develop-
ments. For Vietnam has become a
political symbol of tremendous power,
not only within the U.S. and the
Western world but also within the
Communist world, both inside each
national Communist Movement and
in its relation with the Soviet
Union.
In Paris, for example, in the cur-
rent struggle between the new Left
of the student movement and the old
Left of the orthodox Communist
Party, the Trotskyists and the Maoists
among the student groups have used
solidarity with the Viet Cong as an
emotional rallying-point for revolution-
ary action. For the Soviet Union, the.
Vietnam War continues to pose a
double challenge to its authority and
influence. There is the challenge of
Maoist China. For Peking, Vietnam is
the most potent example of its doctrine
of revolutionary war and of the impos-
sibility of co-existence with the U.S.
as the leader of “world imperialism.”
At the same time there is the
pressure within the Soviet bloc,
especially within eastern Europe, of
which Czechoslovakia is the latest ex-
ample, for greater autonomy and
liberalisation. If this pressure is to be
satisfied without an' open collapse of
the Soviet alliance, it means closer
co-existence with the West. Moscow
would, no doubt, be as pleased as
Peking to see the Vietnam War end
in a Communist victory. But it also
has good reasons which oddly
resemble those of the U.S. for want-
ing the war to end quickly and, if
possible, by negotiation rather than by
outright military victory at the end of a
prolonged struggle. First, a negotiated
settlement favorable to Hanoi and the
National Liberation Front in South.
Vietnam would strengthen the general
Soviet argument that diplomacy, as well
as revolutionary war, can be effective in
dealing with “imperialists,” that it
is not necessarily a betrayal to talk to
Washington. Secondly, continually ex-
panding military and economic aid to
Hanoi imposes a substantial burden on
the economy of the Soviet bloc. It
retards the raising of the standard of
living within the bloc and so increases
the pressures among the East-European
States for changes in their own
economic systems and in their economic
relations with the Soviet Union.
Czechoslovakia, in particular, as one
of the most industrially advanced of the
Communist bloc countries, has had to
devote a disproportionately large part
of its industrial exports to help
Moscow’s policy of military and
economic foreign aid. Although atten-
tion has recently been focused on
Soviet fears that the new Czech regime
might try to leave the Warsaw Pact,
a weakening of the military alliance
with Russia is probably the very last
thing any Czech leader wants, pro-
vided there is an assurance that Russian
military power is not used to intervene
in Czechoslovakia’s internal political
affairs. The Czechs still see Russia as
the indispensable support against any
revived military threat from Germany.
The new Czech reformers seemed to
be more concerned with Comecon than
with the Warsaw Pact. They want a
less rigid economic relationship with
Russia and more trade with the West.
All this again presupposes the develop-
Conference hall in Paris’ Avenue Kleber, where the North
Vietnamese and Americans are meeting


ment of a greater degree of political
confidence between Moscow and Wash-
ington, which is held back by the
Vietnam War.
But in the Vietnam talks themselves,
the representatives of Hanoi give the
cool impression that their policies are,
in the end, determined only by their
own national interests and by the war
in the south itself. So far neither they
nor the American delegation here has
moved from its basic position after
a fortnight of talks and four plenary
sessions’ of largely propagandist
speeches. Hanoi has insisted on an
unconditional and complete stopping of
American bombing of North Vietnam,
and the U.S. has asked what act of
restraint Hanoi is prepared to offer in
return.
At first President Johnson seemed
chiefly concerned with obtaining , a
genuine act of reciprocal military de-
escalation, without any open political
commitment. That is, if Hanoi took
effective steps to restrict, or not to
increase, its dispatch of forces and sup-
plies to the south or to limit its military
threats to the demilitarised zone between
the north and south, or to reduce the
level of violence in the war in the
south, the U.S. would not demand a
public recognition by Hanoi that it had
forces in the south something it has
never officially admitted. But in the past
two sessions of talks here, the American
delegate, Mr. Harriman, seemed to be
more concerned to extract from Hanoi
some official admission of its military
intervention rather than a de facto
de-escalation. He also pointed out that
an admission of this kind would neces-
sarily be involved in any agreement on
either a regrouping of the opposing
forces or a cease-fire, or an eventual
withdrawal of all outside forces, includ-
ing those of the U.S. from South
Vietnam.
Nevertheless, the talks have helped
to clarify the key positions on each
side and indicate the broad framework
within which a settlement will have to
be found.
If the talks can get past the first
obstacle of ending the bombing of
North Vietnam, it looks as if they may
increasingly centre on the two issues:
bringing together two different inter-
pretations of the method of “national
reconciliation” and “self-determination”
for the South Vietnamese—whether by
a coalition Government, elections, or
other means, and the timing of the
withdrawal of “foreign forces” in rela-
tion to a political settlement.
Meanwhile the Viet Cong offensive
against Saigon shows signs of being
aimed not merely at military gains but
at providing the NLF with a political
base inside the South Vietnamese
capital. This would strengthen the
NLF’s claim to an eventual key role
at the negotiating table. It might even
prepare the way for the proclamation
of a rival South Vietnamese Govern-
ment in Saigon itself. The recent
creation in South Vietnam of a new
front, the Alliance of National Demo-
cratic and Peace Forces, already
referred to by the Hanoi delegation
here with significant approval, also
suggests that the ground is being pre-
pared for eventual discussion of some
kind of transition regime in South
Vietnam.
South-East Asia defence
Fishing exercise
From HARVEY STOGKWIN
in Kuala Lumpur
AT THIS STAGE the five-power
defence conference between Malaysia,
Singapore, Britain, Australia, and New
Zealand starting in Kuala Lumpur on
Monday, June 10, looks like being
something of a “fishing” exercise.
Malaysia, Singapore, Australia, and
New Zealand will be “fishing” for pre-
cise indications of Britain’s post-1971
intentions. “Will that general capability
they talk about be more general than
capable?” as one Malaysian wittily put
it to me. Malaysia and Singapore and
the British will be “fishing” to discover
the intended nature of Australian and
New Zealand involvement. British, Aus-
tralian, and New Zealanders will be
“fishing” for indications of the likely
depth of Malaysian-Singapore co-
operation, the extent to which defence
arrangements will be indivisible.
Equally, when the five powers get
Malaysia’s Foreign Minister, Tun Razak
...a successful visit to Moscow
down to work in the handsome treaty
room of the Malaysian foreign office
building, Wisma Putra, it will be recog-
nised in advance that all the “fishing”
will be unlikely to produce any im-
mediate catch. In varying degrees for
all five countries the Paris peace
negotiations, and uncertainty over the
Vietnam outcome, will cast a shadow
of doubt over the proceedings less
for Malaysia and Singapore than for
the others, it would appear.
The British, in all probability, will
be as unlikely as ever to be too specific
as to what they intend, partly because
they intend very little if anything and
partly because the phrases of “con-
tinuing interest,” etc., are still being
used to disguise the degree of their
lack of interest. Obviously, Australia
and New Zealand have no interest
in declaring their hand immediately on
how they will be committed Malaysia
and Singapore assume it is how they
will be committed, not whether they
will be committed.
Last but not least, Malaysia and
Singapore have not got down to the
specifics of defence co-operation any
better than Australia and New Zealand
have. There has been, even during this
last week, much talk about talks—or the
lack of them. There have been some
ministerial contacts, but not, as far as
one can gather, any close consultations
to eliminate progressively the areas of
uncertainty.
In short, amid all the “fishing,” who
will be throwing in a welbbaited line?
But then the inconclusive nature of the
conference is accepted in advance at
least at diplomatic and Government
levels. As with all such conferences
there is the danger that such incon-
clusiveness will set back unduly high
hopes among Press and politicians faced
with a virtually meaningless final
communique.
In point of fact, therefore, it needs
stressing that, provided some lines are
thrown in, this is but the first of what
is intended as a series of conferences
at ministerial level. The way ahead
will be discussed, not produced at one
go-
This prosaic rather than dramatic
function is indicated by what one can
glean of the now agreed agenda. Evi-
dently, the conference—possibly after
an opening address by Tunku Abdul
Rahman—will first get down to busi-
ness over the specific implications of
the British withdrawal by discussing
the future and the fate of the installa-
tions they will be leaving behind. Only
at a later stage will the conference
move on to hear the respective Malay-
sian and Singaporean estimates of the
various threats they face and their
capacity or lack of capacity to meet
them. Presumably while discussion will
include talk of their co-operative
capacity it may also lead on to a
general discussion of the regional situa-
tion as well as British, Australian, and
New Zealand willingness and ability to
supplement that capacity.
Significantly, the conference will not
be starting with a discussion of the
general problem, moving on to the
specifics of how best to deal with it,
which for some observers and parti-
cipants would seem preferable. But
then this conference will not be dealing
with either an ideal situation or an
ideal response. The very fact that it
is being held after the British plans
have been announced signifies this.
Equally, though, the prosaic could well
be productive.

Sunday, May 26, by Aeroflot on an
Ilyushin aircraft diverted to Kuala
Lumpur on its normal flight to
Djakarta symbolic reminder that
when it comes to improving relations
the Russians know all the wrinkles.
(Though when the newly arrived Rus-
sian ambassador was photographed
presenting a Russian copy of the Koran
to the Yang Di-Pertuan Agong recently,
many Malaysians felt they were being a
little too obvious.)
Razak’s visit to Moscow was hurriedly
arranged but obviously successful in
enhancing burgeoning Soyiet-Malaysian
amity. The speed of that burgeoning
has raised some local and foreign eye-
brows a trifle, but on the whole there is
no reason to feel that the KL Govern-
ment is naive on this score. While in
Moscow Razak evidently stressed that
great powers should guarantee South-
East Asian States’ independence and
integrity. The Russians were sympa-
thetic. They, like the Malaysians, are
only too well aware that, as Razak put
it, “another big power in this region
with whom we have not said anything
yet (with regard to great power guaran-
tees)” may not be so accommodating.
Philippines-Japan relations
Bad to worse
By HARVEY STOCKWIN
JAPAN’S RELATIONS with the
Philippines have been uneasy at the best
of times since World War 11,
though, in fairness, there would seem
to be no nation, except possibly Spain,
with whom the Filipinos have “easy”
relations. One of the more fascinating
imponderables of Filipino - Japanese
relations is the mystery of the missing
millions. Under their war-reparations
agreement with the Philippines, the
Japanese agreed to lend some $250
million or so to Filipino private-sector
projects. According to the Japanese,
the amount has already been used up;
according to the Filipinos, none of
this cash has been received by the
private sector. In other words most
of it seems to have gone in graft
or “squeeze” as it is called.
Japan accounts for 27 percent of
Philippines trade—a fact which satisfies
Filipino consumer appetites but which
accentuates economic fears. At the be-
ginning of this decade a treaty of
friendship, trade, and navigation was
negotiated. But, with the decade mov-
ing toward its end, this has yet to be
ratified by the Philippines Senate, even
though the Japanese Diet ratified it
five or six years ago.
While President Marcos has talked
of seeking ratification, especially in the
wake of Japanese Prime Minister Sato’s
visit last year, he has in fact preferred
the indirect approach. Early in 1967 he
ordered that several Japanese trading
firms be allowed to conduct operations
in the Philippines without waiting for
ratification. To date 18 Japanese firms
have eagerly yet warily taken advan-
tage of this executive order.
Recently Senator Salonga, a presiden-
tial possibility for next year, alleged
that the National Economic Council
resolution which allegedly buttressed
the presidential order was faked. Close
on this charge Manila’s Mayor Vil-
legas, who has already declared his
availability for the Vice-Presidency
President Marcos of the Philippines
has been nursing an ankle, sprained
while playing golf recently
next year, first gave the 18 firms 72
hours to explain why their permits
and licences should not be cancelled.
Then later, on May 6, suspended their
permits and operations pending inves-
tigation of Salonga’s charges.
Of course Villegas’ jurisdiction only
covers Manila, and no doubt the Japa-
nese firms are also operating in the
nearby business centre of Makati, well
outside his control. Certainly, too, the
Filipinos have good reason to fear for
their economic weakness in relation to
Japan’s economic strength.
But, despite facts such as these, it
is Filipino political and international
weakness which is best illustrated by
the affair. Vainly the Philippines
“Herald” editorialised that “the furore
over Japanese business activities in the
Philippines is a matter that should
be removed from politics,” before the
political football harms diplomatic and
economic relations. Equally vainly the
Manila “Times” called for action one
way or another vis-a-vis the unratified
treaty. More accurately, columnist J. V.
Cruz predicted that “the Marcos ad-
ministration is going to be in for
another prolonged and painful siege.”
It is after all the third year of
Marco’s Presidency the time when,
by now almost traditionally, Filipino
Presidents get politically mauled prior
to their fourth-year failure to obtain
re-election. The withdrawal of the
Philippines Philcag .detachment in Viet-
nam, due to Congressional inability to
appropriate the money for its continu-
ance, and the prolonged controversy
over Sabah are both issues which dimin-
ished Marcos’ credibility and claims to
effectiveness. This current contretemps
may well do likewise, and if the Philip-
pines’ relations with yet another neigh-
bor get hurt, the “Herald’s” plea to
save the Philippines “a lot of em-
barrassment abroad for our country’s
sake” would seem out of the Filipino
context. All that is certain is that the
Filipinos will go on politicking, while,
with or without “squeeze,” the Japan-
ese will go on trading.'
Mayor Villegas’ executive order
closing the 18 Japanese firms is effec-
tive pending ratification of the treaty
and reliable sources indicate ratifi-
cation by present Congress is most un-
likely. President Marcos has asked
the Securities and Exchange Commis-
sion to advise the Japanese to suspend
all business pending decisions on the
legality of their operations.
The dispute looks like heading
as do many issues in the Philippines —•
into the courts. A Senate Committee
has ruled that the National Economic
Council resolution under which Marcos
originally acted was never officially
approved and that there were reason-
able grounds for believing “the offence
of falsification of public documents
was committed” though such a
finding was exclusively for courts to
determine. But was Villegas’ action
any more legal? According to the
Justice Department, the Manila Mayor
had no legal grounds for annulling the
Japanese business permits and had
acted against national policy as formu-
lated by Marcos.
Of course he did, and for good poli-
tical reasons. The Senate Committee
has implicitly backed Salonga’s asser-
tions and both he and Villegas have
almost certainly got their presidential
bids off to a good start by playing on
the anti-Japanese sentiments which,
unlike anti-American ones, do extend
throughout the Philippines. The sen-
sible remarks of Marcos defending his
actions in terms of the need for
investment, like those of the Japanese
Ambassador insisting that Japan has no
intention of imposing a colonial pat-
tern of trade upon its neighbors, have
tended, needless to say, to get lost
amidst the furore.


What minerals add up to for Australia
By BRIAN HOAD
THE MINERALS BOOM is not just
something that is making everyone rich
on the stock exchange; it is really bring-
ing a major change to Australia’s pros-
perity. So far only a fraction of the im-
pact of the present developments have
been reflected in higher exports and in-
creased replacement of imports. But
that fraction is significant and is steadily
increasing.
The impact of the minerals boom has
not been only on exports. (Thirty years
ago minerals earned less than $2O mil-
lion a year; last year they brought in
$370 million and by 1975 they should
return something near $lOOO million, or
roughly what the wool industry is ex-
pected to earn). It also represents
massive import replacement, not only
of existing imports, such as oil, but of
new and growing demands such as
aluminium and uranium. By 1970, for
example, local oil production should be
saving more than $3OO million a year in
foreign oil imports (last year it saved
only a few million dollars). All Aus-
tralia’s aluminium needs are now met
from local production and there is
plenty left over for export. If the recent
big phosphate finds prove to be worth
developing, Australia could save up to
$3O million a year of its import bill.
On the other hand, it is vital to put
the minerals revolution into perspective:
last year exports of minerals were worth
less than half the value of wool exports.
Sooner or later they should catch up,
but it will probably not be before 1975.
And wool’s remarkable performance in
increasing its export revenue by nine
times in the past 30 years, despite a
dismal price level, so that it still earns
almost one-third of Australia’s total
export income, is one that minerals will
find hard to beat in the next 30 years.
What the minerals’ boom is doing is
allowing Australia a much faster rate
of economic growth, by providing funds
for imports of machinery and so on,
than the agricultural sector could have
provided, particularly at a time when
world agricultural commodity prices
have been going against Australia. With-
out minerals, Australia would be a sort
of magnified New Zealand, convinced
that the rest of the world is out of step
and not prepared to do anything about
fitting in with what the world wants.
Minerals have saved us the trouble of
working out an agricultural policy.
The fluctuations of commodity prices
and the inflation of money have little
bearing on the crude facts of bartering.
In 1937 exports of wool worth $94
million paid for the country’s four
major imports of textiles, machinery,
pulp and paper, and petroleum; cereals,
worth $57 million, more than ade-
quately took care of other major import
items including processed iron and steel
($ll million), chemicals ($7 million),
wood ($5 million), vehicles ($3 mil-
lion), and fertilisers ($2 million).
The massive contribution of the rural
industries in buying the foundation
stones of industrial Australia is well
proven and by no means past. But
industry, once established, feeds on
mineral resources.
The glamorous part that mineral
resources are to play in Australia’s
development is mostly a figment of the
future. The past is a modest one.
Exports of mineral ores went from $7
million in 1937 to $164 million by last
year—an expansion in monetary terms
similar to that of sugar. Over the same
period, the value of coal exports in-
creased from $0.4 million to $73 mil-
lion, processed iron and steel had
changed from a net import worth $ll
million to a net export worth $46 mil-
lion and processed non-ferrous metals
showed a net export gain worth $l3l
million.
But since 1955 something of a revolu-
tion has been in preparation. Anti-
quated geological theories have been
cast off, geophysical surveys have been
carried out with fresh and increasing
enthusiasm, test holes have been drilled
in their thousands. Australia is making
its debut as a world’s minerals supplier.
Between 1950 and 1954, BHP to-
gether with the Commonwealth Bureau
of Mineral Resources turned up some
iron deposits in the Northern Territory
at Roper Bar. By present standards it
was no bonanza but the deposits were of
a new kind and in a new geological
environment and they gave rise to the
belief that with incentives more de-
posits would be found. In 1960 the
Federal Government was able to
announce the lifting of the ban on
iron-ore exports, imposed during World
War 11. The next year the Government
of Western Australia changed its policy
on iron-ore deposits, inviting tenders
for rights to explore and mine. Reserves
of some 500 million tons were turned
up before—in 1964—it was officially
announced that the Hamersley Ranges
held reserves in excess of 14,000 million
tons.
The capital outlay to exploit these
resources of iron-ore has already
exceeded $6OO million; export contracts
have been drawn up in excess of $3OOO
million. By 1975 exports are expected
to be bringing in at least $220 million
a year.
In 1955 the bauxite deposits at Weipa
on Queensland’s Cape York Peninsula
were discovered together with those
across the Gulf of Carpentaria at Gove
and those in the Darling Range of
Western Australia; some 3000 million
tons in all, about one-third of the
world’s known deposits.
In 1950 the annual production of
bauxite was 3467 tons. The Common-
wealth and Tasmanian State Govern-
ments were in the process of building a
facility at Bell Bay, Tasmania, which
would use 80,000 tons a year, producing
13,000 tons of metal. By 1961, when it
had become a joint venture between
the Tasmanian Government and Com-
alco, Australian consumption of the
primary metal was already twice its
capacity. Comalco’s smelting capacity
has now been lifted to 72,000 tons and
Alcoa’s is 40,000 tons and is soon to be
doubled. From the Weipa deposits, the
world’s biggest, stemmed the alumina
plant at Gladstone, where capacity is
being raised from 600,000 to 900,000
tons. There were expansions in alu-
minium manufacturing plant, too. From
the bauxite deposits at Weipa and the
Darling Ranges has come industrial
growth representing an investment in
excess of $450 million, where before
there was virtually nothing. In 1962"
Australia was producing 16,000 tons of
the metal and consuming 50,000 tons.
Last year it was producing 110,000 tons-
and consuming 85,000 tons.
Beach sands are another good ex-
ample of the sound development of
raw materials in the national interest.
In 1950 a ban on the export of crude-
mixed concentrates of these minerals
forced the miners to take over the
profitable separation of the sands them-
selves despite howls of protest
and has enabled vast new reserves to-
be opened up, turning a “•backyard”'
industry into an export earner of $3O
million a year. It also brought to-
Australia two big manufacturers of tit-
anium pigments (from rutile) creating
a self-sufficient industry saving $9 mil-
lion a year on imports and well placed
to develop an export market of its own.
Australia is the world’s largest pro-
ducer of rutile and zircon and takes
second place in ilmenite. At the present
rate of extraction known reserves are
sufficient for at least 20 years. But
zirconium and particularly titanium
are metals of the future. Titanium is
finding increasing use in the world of
supersonic aircraft and spacecraft
because of its lightness, strength, and
resistence to heat. As with other mineral
resources, questions of conservation for
. Australia’s industrial and technological
future must eventually be considered
seriously. For uranium, the decision to
conserve has already 'been made.
The restrictions on the exports of
uranium introduced last year are criti-
cised on the grounds that they will dis-
courage prospecting. They were im-
posed, on the other hand, because
known reserves of this mineral are
so small about 11,000 tons, enough
to feed a reactor for a medium-sized


electricity-generating station for its
lifespan of 35 years. But if some of
the more recent uranium scrambles on
the share-market are anything to go
by, no particular gloom has yet been
cast in the prospecting area.
Arguments for conserving energy
supplies, together with the need to
supply the ever-increasing demand of
an expanding steel industry, also apply
to coal. At present, the distribution of
production is 56 percent on electricity
production, 24 percent for export, and
20 percent for iron and steel. But
exports of coal are growing rapidly.
Non-existent after the war, they grew
to half a million tons in 1957, to 8
million tons in 1966, and in 1970 are
expected to be in excess of 12 million
tons and worth $lOO million. Measured
and indicated reserves in Queensland
and N.S.W. are something in excess of
5000 million tons; inferred reserves are
“very large.”
Of the energy-producing minerals,
oil and natural gas have proved the
most controversial and the most expen-
sive to develop. The three strikes at
Moonie, Bass Strait, and Barrow Island,
which by 1970 should be supplying
A workman is a tiny dot in the fore-
ground of the Queensland Alumina
plant at Gladstone
about 110 million barrels or 60 percent
of Australia’s needs, are the results of
a program of drilling and exploration
which has cost, so far, about $330
million of which the Government paid
$75 million. It has always been the
Government, seeking the political
Independence of the national transport
system, which has boosted the search.
After the “no oil in Australia” period
of the ’twenties came the Government’s
subsidy of drilling in 1936. After the
first four unsuccessful years of WAPET
in Western Australia from 1952, came
the Government’s taxation and subsi-
dised drilling incentives in 1956. The
first major gas strikes at Roma in 1961,
the first commercial oil strike at Moonie
at the end of the same year, the first
off-shore strike by Esso in the Bass
Strait in February ’65 were followed
later in 1965 by the Government’s
currently controversial price margin on
each barrel of locally produced crude.
The Tariff Board had suggested 25c;
the Government upped this to 75c leav-
ing no doubt that it wished to “pro-
vide a significant incentive” to explora-
tion.
In May, 1966, after 14 years of
searching and the expenditure of $7O
million, WAPET at last came up with
its strike on Barrow Island. With re-
serves estimated at 85 million barrels
it was not a large find by any means,
but it will gross more than $250 mil-
lion during its lifetime. The massive
effort and the astronomical cost of its
discovery have paid off handsomely.
Oil is still very much an infant in-
dustry. Self-sufficiency is still a political
dream. Hope has never burnt brighter.
Vying with oil on the stock-markets
in recent times has been nickel, an
essential ingredient of stainless-steel
and other modern alloys. Known world
deposits totalling some 45 million tons
in Cuba, New Caledonia, and Canada
have always been regarded as adequate
to meet any foreseeable increase in
defence and industrial requirements.
World consumption stands at 386,000
tons with a growth rate of about 6
percent; Australia’s at 3500 tons, plus
a further 1000 tons in the form of
salts—the total value, all imported,
being about $4 million.
The first Australian strike of any
importance was that of Western Mining
at Kambalda in 1966. At the beginning
of 1967 the size of the strike was put
at 1.9 million tons of ore containing
4.16 percent nickel. By nnd-year it had
become 4.7 million tons, and by Feb-
ruary last 9.3 million tons. It could be
27 million or 70 million tons, and such
is the prospecting activity at present
that there is no telling just how much
will eventually be turned up.
At present the metal sells at about
$l9OO a ton. WMC has plans to pro-
duce 15,000 tons a year of the pure
metal and 5000 tons of concentrates
by 1971. If Australian reserves prove
massive enough there is the possibility
that the price could be dropped to
change the entire present pattern of
world nickel consumption.
Most of Australia’s oldtimers in the
minerals stakes plod steadily on along
their time-worn courses. Copper is as
unstable and unpredictable as ever;
still the barometer of war and peace;
still the victim of political and social
upheaval in the countries of its major
origin. Home production last year was
117,000 tons, mostly from Mt. Isa; local
consumption stood at 85,000 tons. With
Mt. Isa expanding its production to
100,000 tons there should be enough of
the metal available to supply local
demand and leave a little for export
until about 1975. The mining of several
known deposits will presumably be in
operation by then. But the future of the
90 million tons of low-grade ore found
on the island of Bougainville in 1964
is clouded.
The traditional steady income-earners
in the minerals field are lead and zinc.
Before the current minerals boom it
was for these two metals that Aus-
tralia was known: as the world’s second-
largest lead producer, almost equal in
capacity to the U.S.S.R.; as the world’s
fourth - largest zinc producer after
Canada, the U.S., and the U.S.S.R.
From the lead/zinc deposits come also
90 percent of Australia’s silver produc-
tion, some 22 million ounces last year,
making us the world’s sixth-largest
producer.
Of close on 400,000 tons each of lead
and zinc produced last year by far the
largest proportion came from the
Broken Hill mines of N.S.W. Home
consumption stands at about 40,000 tons-
of lead and 90,000 tons of zinc. There
are no reliable predictions about the
future of the Broken Hill deposits,
though more than 100 million tons of
ore have been removed since 1885. But
at Mt. Isa known reserves of at least
32 million tons of silver/lead/zinc ores
are known, while last year it was esti-
mated that Mt. Isa Mine’s new deposits
on the McArthur River in the Northern
Territory contained at least 200 million
tons of low-grade ores.
There have been major discoveries of
phosphate rock for fertilisers in north-
west Queensland, of manganese on
Groote Eylandt in the Gulf of Car-
pentaria, and of tungsten, again for
steel, on King Island. There have been
no major discoveries of tin, and the
present position of satisfying home
demand and leaving a little over for
export cannot be expected to last for
more than a few years.
There are a few minor gaps in Aus-
tralia’s mineral resources two of which
•—asbestos and diamonds—there is not
much geological hope of filling. Sulphur,
however, though absent in the crude
form is abundant in the compounded
state. At Broken Hill, for example, sul-
phuric acid is produced as a by-product
of the zinc refineries and has formed
the basis for a million-tons-a-year
fertiliser industry. The sulphur imports
bill last year was nonetheless $l5 mil-
lion. There is also a lack of potash, for
which future prospects of discovery are
hopeful to eliminate a small item of
$233,000 from the import bilL
Phosphate and magnesite still cost the
country $29 million and $2 million re-
spectively each year, but there is plenty
around awaiting economic exploitation.
Enthusiastic brokers are expecting
mineral exports to exceed $lOOO million
by 1972. Sober geologists and the
Bureau of Mineral Resources put the
figure between $6OO million and $7OO
million. Either way, its achievement
depends on raising funds at the rate of
$4OO million a year to finance the indus-
try. But even then they may not have
caught up with the export earnings
clipped from the sheep’s back.

Saigon revisited
By PETER SAMUEL
FOR THE YOUNG GI taking his first
Vietnam leave by spending a few days
in Saigon it is an old gagline. Having
entered a bar, accepted the company of
one of its hostesses, and got bis whisky,
be puts his arm around his girl and
sighs to bis buddy: “Ain’t war hell?”
Drinking a beer, on my latest visit, I
heard that gag again. But there was a
difference. For one thing it was at one
of a greatly reduced number of bars.
For another there was a just-imposed
dawn-to-dusk curfew which kept people
indoors to give the police and army a
free go against the second-wave offen-
sive of the Communists against Saigon,
which celebrated the beginning of peace
talks in Paris. Outside, the streets were
much quieter than usual. Only occasion-
ally did one hear the roar of heavy
trucks taking loads of bombs from the
waterfront to Tan Son Nhut and Bien
Hoa, or the rumble of a. tracked
armored vehicle. True, if you listened
for it you could just detect the varied
reverberations of a firefigbt ten miles
away, somewhere beyond the airport.
But it was pretty peaceful and cosy in
the enclosed bar with its soft lights and
French pop music.
I was still chuckling at the American’s
gag, which had attracted two more
girls to his seat, when the whole place
was shaken by an almighty explosion:
a great thumping whoomph of a noise.
(The next morning a policeman told
me it had been a mortar bomb which
had dropped on a hotel a hundred yards
away.) After our big blast there was an
explosion perhaps half a mile away, and
another at a reassuring distance. Two
jeeps with flak-jacketed Military Police
and heavy machine-guns mounted at the
back passed us with their communica-
tions radio blaring orders to investigate
our blast. Nothing more for a minute.
We grew less tense. But the cosy cool
of the bar was really restored when the
Gl’s first girl loudly pronounced a
favorite Vietnamese sardonicism: “Sorry
’’bout that.”
Later that night there was another
mortar round which woke everyone, and
by that time two quite intense firefights
had developed on the outskirts of the
city. Everyone climbed to the roof to
watch until daybreak. In the flare-
lighted parts of the sky the jets could
be seen swooping in to bomb and strafe,
and in darker places there were obvi-
ously gunships equipped with rapid-
firing miniguns—which sent long spurts
of red tracer on to spots on the ground.
The only uninterrupted night of sleep
I managed to get was out at the Aus-
tralian Task Force base at Nui Dat,
where they have even stopped the “har-
assment and interdiction” firing on sus-
pected Communist camps out in the
jungle. The Americans have taken their
devilishly noisy 175 mm. guns away,
and, fortunately for sleepers, they
haven’t been replaced. But every other
night in Saigon there were some fire-
works. A volley of rockets one night—
one into an apartment on Tu Do, the
posh shopping street; another into some
parked cars; two MPs in a jeep killed
outright in a hail of very accurate
sniper fire at the end of the street by
the river.
By day Saigon was almost normal.
Traffic was just perceptibly lighter,
which made it easier to get around.
Most government offices and businesses
seemed to be functioning normally. The
air was occasionally rent by the scream
or fire-engine sirens racing here or
there. At various times about four small
areas of the city were closed to traffic
because the North Vietnamese had con-
centrated and were firing from houses
at police or troops. Americans were
pretty jittery, knowing that they were
prime targets. And with other journal-
ists I was pretty unnerved about the
slaughter of four of our colleagues on
the second day of the offensive. Saigon-
ese seemed quite nonchalant about the
situation.
This was the much spoken-of second
wave to follow up the Tet offensive.
And it was a fizzer. Between twenty
and thirty communist battalions
(mainly North Vietnamese this time)
were deployed for the attack, but due
to spoiling operations in the surround-
ing countryside and an improved peri-
meter defence only about four managed
to get inside the city limits. In Cholon
and at the airport they were quickly
crushed by Vietnamese rangers, around
the Bien Hoa road-bridge by the Viet-
namese police, only in the brick-house
area south of the Central Market were
the Americans with their aircraft
needed.
The Communists had some luck in
killing two important Vietnamese ■—
the deputy-chief of police, who was
gunned down in much the same manner
as the Australian journalists and in the
same area. He was unlucky enough to
have been driving through an area of
Cholon where they were forming up
for an action. Another high-ranking
Vietnamese, the commandant of Tan
Son Nhut military base was killed by
one of four mortar bombs randomly
lobbed one afternoon into the many
hundred acres of the base.
A Communist divisional commander,
Colonel Dac, who defected during the
second offensive, told journalists at a
Press conference in Saigon that the aim
of the second offensive on Saigon was
to occupy areas of the city for long
enough to organise street demonstra-
tions in support of the National Liber-
The short-term result of “armed
propaganda” in Saigon is human
misery , but what are the chances of
success in the long run?
ation Front or one of the new fronts
being given so much time on Hanoi
Radio. Such demonstrations would be
of great propaganda benefit to the
North Vietnamese delegation in Paris.
In fact, said Dac, the North Vietnamese
had not occupied any worthwhile
areas, and far from helping them, the
citizenry of Saigon had informed on
them and helped Government forces
to track them down.
It was a classic example of “armed
propaganda,” a trading of lives for
perceptions about the war. Six thous-
and lives were sacrificed (5000 of their
soldiers plus about 1000 civilians) for
the remote hope of being able to mobi-
lise street demonstrations, and for the
accomplishment of inspiring headlines
in Western newspapers that “the Viet
Cong have done it again; they are in
Saigon.” At no stage was there the
slightest chance of them threatening any
militarily or governmentally important
part of the city, such as the Presi-
dential Palace, the Tan Son Nhut bases,
the National Assembly building, police
headquarters, or the Radio-TV station.
They caused a bit of disruption, a
temporary rise in rice prices, and misery
for several thousand civilians, but only
added quite marginally to the problems
of the Government.
As the excellent Current Affairs
Bulletin on the subject of the Tet
Offensive argues, the latest phase of
Communist military strategy is mainly
successful as an “armed propaganda
operation.” To take an example of its
success, the impression has evidently
been created in many people’s minds
that the fighting in Saigon has devas-
tated vast areas of the city. Terrible
though the destruction was for the
people involved, my impression was
that perhaps ten acres out of the city’s
20,000 acres of built-up area were
wrecked, and most of the destroyed
housing was shanty construction.
Another impression was that Saigon
communications with the outside world
had been cut off, the airport closed
for days. What happened, to my
knowledge, was that one flight out of
Saigon was cancelled, giving the wire


.services the news that the airport had
been closed. Either they didn’t file the
less dramatic story that it had been
opened again about two hours later, or
sub-editors on the other end didn’t
think that newsworthy. So readers were
left with an exaggerated view of the
seriousness of the situation in the air-
port area. Many other examples could
be given of overdramatised impressions
being conveyed.
It is probably more difficult than
ever in the Vietnam conflict to spell
out the power balance between the
two sides and the speed and direction
in which that balance is changing.
One thing is certain: few people in
Vietnam think with eternal pessimists
like Denis Warner, that “the Tet
Offensive was Washington’s Dien Bien
Phu,” that the Paris talks will lead
inexorably to “peace on the best terms
available” that time is obviously on
Hanoi’s side, and that the struggle is
as good as lost already.
Immediately after Johnson’s March
31 speech, in which he made the
announcements that he wasn’t running
for another term and that he was de-
escalating, many South Vietnamese
(and U.S. military in Vietnam)
gloomily pondered this prospect.
But the idea that a simple “sellout” is
likely, appears to have been increas-
ingly rejected during April. U.S.
policy has been very firm ever since
then: firm over the site for talks, firm
in continuing to reject “coalition with
the Communists” as. an acceptable solu-
tion, and firm on the southern battle-
field. U.S. military commanders have
in' no way been leant on by the
Administration to deploy their troops
more defensively in any further act of
unilateral concession. On the contrary,
Toan Thang and Quyet Thang, opera-
tions around Saigon involving 100,000
troops, represent the, most ambitious
offensive operations of the war. And
the assault into the A Shau Valley
(the end of Ho Chi Minh trail) was
another indication that the U.S. was
prepared to match the North Vietna-
mese in their talk-but-fight-more
strategy.
An important part of winning hearts
and minds has always been to look like
being the eventual victor. From the
time in 1966 when the Americans
started their repeated calls for peace
talks and made their pledge to with-
draw their troops within six months
■of peace, many Vietnamese decided
that they were either liars or losers:
a self-confident, winning power does
not constantly plead for negotiations, at
least not sincerely. So with American
backing always doubtful as a continu-
ing factor, Vietnamese commitment to
the anti-Communist cause has always
been heavily qualified, even among
those who stand to lose most by a
Communist takeover.
The events of this year appear to
have promoted two contrary tenden-
cies. On the one hand, the actual pros-
pect of an American withdrawal has
strengthened doubts about the ability
of the South to prevent Hanoi taking
over. There are reports, especially from
lower-level officials and military, of
increased reluctance to resist Commu-
nist attacks and increased willingness
to try to do deals with them. There
is some evidence of some further
erosion of morale at these levels.
But on the other hand there is evi-
dence that the past six months have
seen a development of self-assurance
among South Vietnamese. Despite
repeated predictions of an open breach
between President Thieu and Vice-
President Ky, talk of a resurgence of
militant Buddhist and student dis-
orders, and speculation about coups,
none of these has occurred. The demo-
cratic institutions of an elected presi-
dency and parliament have managed
so far to reconcile conflicts quite
effectively and to have produced a
necessary degree of stability.
The wire services have, of course,
told the headline-earning story that the
dismissal of Prime Minister Loc, and
his replacement by Tran Van Huong,
is another manifestation of a feud
between Thieu and Ky, and that it
presages some open split. Since I
was told by one of the Vice-
President’s associates two weeks ago
that Ky was. impatient with Loc and
that they had to find a new Premier,
it can be said categorically that Ky
is not, as the wire services assert,
annoyed at Thieu’s dismissal of Loc.
Ky’s associate said that the successor
to Loc would be either Mr. Huong or
General Thang, commander of the
Mekong Delta area, formerly Minister
for Revolutionary Development. He
told me that the Vice-President thought
Thang had greater inherent ability,
but that he was unlikely to be
appointed for two reasons: one, he
was most reluctant to come back into
government at this stage and would
have to be “drafted by the generals”
into becoming prime minister; two,
being military, a northerner, and very
closely associated with the Americans,
he lacked electoral and political appeal.
Ky apparently believed that Huong
was, on balance, the correct choice.
Faced by crucial questions such as
a possible rundown of American mili-
tary power in Vietnam or attempts by
the Americans to negotiate them into
a coalition, non-Communists in Viet-
nam have responded by developing a
notable political consensus. “The
Americans, by pushing us into consti-
tutional government faster than we
wanted to go, have created something
more powerful than anyone expected.
They are going to find it very hard
to sell us out, if that is what they
want to do. We are, after all, the
elected representatives of the people,
and we rule within the framework of
a democratic constitution, and we can-
not be just thrown aside like a couple
of generals or their appointees,” one
Vietnamese leader told me.
The self-confidence and consensus
seem to be built to a large degree on
improvements in the performance of the
Vietnamese Army. If the Tet Offen-
sive was seen outside Vietnam as a
defeat for the Saigon Government,
from what I could gather during a
week’s visit, it was seen quite differently
there. It was regarded as a critical
test of the Saigon Government and
its Army, which despite difficulty and
setbacks, the Government managed
to pass. The assault by about 100,000
Viet Cong and North Vietnamese was
concentrated almost entirely on Viet-
namese defences, American installa-
tions and areas of military respon-
sibility being either bypassed or merely
harassed. It had become a principal
theme of Communist propaganda
internal as well as external that
the ARVN was “shaken, depressed,
and disintegrated,” to use the phrase
of General Giap in a long-winded
article at the time the Tet Offensive
was being conceived. A document
called “Clearly Understand the New
Situation and Mission” laid great
emphasis on the need to concentrate
on the Vietnamese Army: “Destroy
and disintegrate the main body of the
puppet army so it ceases to be a
force on which the U.S. imperialists
can rely in pursuing their aggressive
war. Wreck the puppet Army to the
point where it can no longer main-
tain the reactionary political regime
of the U.S. henchmen . . .”
On this basis, total victory was fore-
cast. In the event the Vietnamese
Army fought well, considering the
holiday stand-down, and Communist
headquarters in the South reported:
“Since we did not succeed in com-
pletely destroying many of his mobile
and defensive units at the start, nor
did we closely co-ordinate (the mili-
tary) offensive with (a civilian) upris-
ing and troops proselytising, the enemy
still resisted and his units were not
disrupted . . .” It was up against
an army which it now described as
“stubborn, reactionary, and well-
equipped.”
“Give us time and hardware and
we can’t take over the job of the
Americans” is the theme in Saigon
at the moment. Ti me to implement
total mobilisation of males between
18 and 40, and to train leadership,
and hardware to give Vietnamese units
some of the firepower and mobility
which the Americans are able cur-
rently to employ.
And the thinking is not entirely
military. Some Saigon correspondents
paint a picture of the Government and
its supporters as consisting of a mono-
lithic block of utterly uncompromising
and unrealistic people. In fact, a num-
ber of political compromises short
of coalition, which is considered too
risky are being discussed for pre-
sentation once the North Vietnamese
demonstrate some willingness to make
concessions.


The wisest and kindest
of beasts
By SANDRA HALL
“HE’S SOMETHING of a rogue
elephant of literary criticism, but then
elephants are the wisest and kindest
of beasts.” And so, A 1 Alvarez the
British poetry critic was introduced
to last week’s UNESCO seminar on
criticism by the academic chairing the
session on literature.
Wearing a beard and a candy-
striped shirt, he did present a dashing
contrast with the surrounding tweedi-
ness, but as the week wore on, the
point about rogue elephants and kindli-
ness was proven. With Alvarez, there
are no dogmatic dead ends. He has
just ended his ten-year spell as poetry
critic of the London “Observer,” sum-
ming up his critical stance in the title
essay of a book to be published here
soon “Beyond All This Fiddle,”
and he doesn’t mind admitting that
the essay was re-written many times,
and that even now, he’s still thinking
about it.
Clement Greenberg, the American
import to the seminar, which was held
at the University of Sydney, has
Alvarez’s gregariousness, but not his
fluency. As befits an art critic in doubt
about the ultimate efficency of words,
he is very careful with them.
The Contemporary Art Society pre-
ceded his visit with a broadsheet stat-
ing, “No discussion of modern Ameri-
can art or criticism seems safely to
be able to ignore Mr. Greenberg’s
views.” And his opinion that judg-
ment of art depends finally on the
experience a critic gets from a paint-
ing, not on rationalisation, seemed to
strike a few chords among local critics
last week. “He’s said what I’ve believed
all my life,” was a frequently heard
remark in university hallways and over
lunch.
It is Greenberg’s belief that there is
always a consensus of opinion about
a painting, and that consensus can be
assumed to have come from people
who’ve spent most time with the
painting. The majority opinion, he
says, seems to preserve good art and
distinguish it from bad art, although
there’s no final truth about it.
And if a critic’s reaction doesn’t
agree with that of the majority?
“Nothing can ever make you change
your reaction except another
reaction. Words can’t do it. You have
to stay wrong until you’re corrected
by a second reaction. I learn more
from being wrong than right.”
Greenberg, balding and somewhat
sad-eyed, is the son of a Jewish busi-
nessman. He painted and drew as
a child, but his first critical essays
were about literature, not art. At
Syracuse University, he learned three
languages, although academic life
didn’t exactly foster his interest in
the arts. “There were two people to
talk to at Syracuse University when
I was there, but I became interested
in literature, because there was noth-
ing else to get interested in.”
After college, he worked for the U.S.
Civil Service Commission, then joined
the U.S. Customs -SiTvice, as a clerk
in the wines and liquor department.
“I couldn’t have been less interested
in the job, but I had to make a
living.
“Yes, I was writing all the time
Clement Greenberg ... the challenge of being literate
when you write about art
about literature. I became an editor
of ‘Partisan Review,’ I knew the
literary editor of ‘The Nation.’ At
that time there was a lot of odd
stuff being written about art, so I
thought I’d take a crack at it. I know
writing about literature helped me,
because there’s a higher standard of
literacy in literary criticism than there
is in art criticism. One of the biggest
challenges is to be literate when you’re
writing about art.”
Odd writing jobs and translations
were eventually earning enough money
to make him feel he could resign from
the Customs Service, and, in 1945, he
became associate editor of “Commen-
tary,” where he stayed for the next
13 years. Since 1957, he has worked
wholly as a writer. “My father used
to say, ‘lf you stick
to one thing long-
enough, you’ll end up
making a living out of
it’.”
In 1955, he stopped
writing about litera-
ture, because his inter-
est had shifted entirely
to art. “I guess it was.
the faster movement of
art that attracted me.”
Ask Greenberg if he
thinks more people are
taking an interest in
art, and he’ll say,
“apparently.” He’s
cautious that way. He
is also cautious about
the beneficial effects of
this new interest (that
is if it exists, of
course).
“In some ways it’s
a good thing,” he says
laconically.
Can it hamper art’s
development?
“It can. You get
the pressure of a lot
of people who are new
to art and their inter-
est is not exactly
urgent. But, on the
other hand, I have to
be careful in saying
that because time may
go by and this will be
all to the good.”
In any case, the
pub 1 i c’s increased


awareness about art has been good for
Oreenberg’s writing. “I’m beginning to
feel I can take more for granted on the
part of readers.
“But the most annoying thing is to
find readers interpreting my analyses as-
pieces of advocacy, as if what I say is
important in the past is what I am
.advocating for the future.”
One thing that hasn’t changed is the
fact that he finds it hard to read art
■criticism. “Apollinaire started it when
he was writing about cubism before
World War I, not understanding it,
but just getting the feeling. The sur-
realistic critics did their best and there’s
Al Alvarez...a case of critic’s fatigue
:a French tradition of gibberish that the
Americans have inherited.”
And the progress and changes in his
own tastes? “I fancy that my taste has
■expanded and that I’m less narrow . . .
I hope,” he says, a careful man to
the end.
When Alvarez stepped up to the lec-
tern after the “rogue elephant” intro-
•duction, it was to throw a fundamental
•question at the critical company before
him. He was, he said, about to air some
radical doubts about the relevance of
criticism. In other words, “can one
justify one’s existence?”
One could, he concluded, if one was
prepared to meet society without any
preconceptions. “Critics can make
explicit to the artist what happens
inside him, but, in doing so, they must
keep as open an imagination as the
artist himself.”
But, as far as Alvarez is concerned,
the question is largely a hypothetical
one, since he’s already decided to give
up his regular post as a critic to write
a book on suicide.
A non-fiction book seems a strange
project for a man whose life up to now
has been concerned with literature,
although Alvarez doesn’t think so. “The
subject interests me, because a couple
of my friends have committed suicide,
and because all the books written about
it so far have been so dry and statistical
as if the fact of a
person’s death just
didn’t come into it.”
Weidenfeld and
Nicolson have given
him a generous ad-
vance on the book, suf-
ficient, he estimates,
to support him for the
next two years, which
is one reason for
giving up his job as
a critic.
The other, a more
important one, is his
case of critic’s fatigue,
brought on by the
succession of slim and
not-so-slim volumes
cascading through his
letter-box every day
for the past ten years.
Not that those volumes
have been without
reward, like the col-
lection of Robert
Lowell’s poetry, which
established the poet’s
reputation.
“I’d read his poetry
before, but the day
this book arrived, I
rang the literary edi-
tor of the ‘Observer,’
told him how import-
ant I felt the book
was, and he, a saint
of a man, told me to
go ahead and do as I
liked. So I devoted a
whole review to the
book instead of split-
ting it up between
several books.”
Alvarez also secured a hearing for
Sylvia Plath, a poet he feels approached
genius in the months which preceded
her suicide at the age of 31.
“At that time, she was producing
two and three poems a. day she’d
get up at four in the morning and write
them during the next three hours,
before her children were awake. They
had tension a feeling of testing
reality—which, for me, marks the best
poetry.”
Alvarez came to literary criticism
from Oxford, where he took a first in
English and lectured for a time. He
has made several lengthy trips to
America, one of them for a series of
radio interviews he did with American
intellectuals, shortly after the death of
Kennedy.
“Most of them told me that the
Kennedy Administration’s interest in
culture was so much window-dressing,
but they also said that the important
thing was that there was a 20th-century
man in the White House, a man you
could actually have a conversation
with.”
The British literary scene, he says, is
a. lively one, although there is a general
air of depression over the ban placed
on Hubert Selby’s “Last Exit to Brook-
lyn,” a novel he regards as one of the
most important books to have come out
of America in recent years.
“I was a witness in the court case,
and the judge, the prosecution, every-
one was in favor of that book being
allowed into Britain. The judge was
mild and the prosecution didn’t present
nearly as many witnesses as the defence
did. The jury was given a whole day to
read the book, but came back into the
court after two hours, saying it should
be banned. I think there was only about
one man on the jury who’d ever read
a book in his life.
“ ‘ Last Exit to Brooklyn’ is extremely
moral. Things like Doris Day films are
the real pornography with all those
asterisk looks.”
On the question of politics in poetry,
Alvarez believes that East European
poets are the only ones who’ve been
successful in the art so far.
The protest poems written in the
West about Vietnam have added up to
a lot of rhetoric, but no poetry. “The
East European poets have politics in
their blood, and when they write about
it, it’s been filtered through their own
consciousness. Read this poem by a
Polish poet about the war the war
is going on around him, but his own
emotions are the important thing.”
Plans for a book on suicide and a
film script about the 19th-century
anarchist Bakunin should absolve
Alvarez from any charges concerning
the specialist’s neglect of things outside
his subject. And if these plans didn’t
exist, he still wouldn’t be guilty.
His more worldly interests extend to
fast cars, rock-climbing, and poker for
high stakes (“I play with some ex-
Communists who earned a lot of
money writing for Hollywood and feel
so guilty about their capitalist gains
that they feel compelled to lose them”).
And his explanation for them is a
general fascination with question of
“control.”
“All those things demand control
whether it’s control over a steering
wheel or sitting for hours in complete
control of your reactions, as you have
to do in poker.”
One would also imagine that interests
like those would provide concrete
relief for the abstractions which swirled
and eddied through air around the
University of Sydney last week.


Now’s the day, now’s the hour?
THE SCOTTISH Nationalist Party
has only one representative in the
House of Commons, Winifred Ewing.
It did, however, make significant pro-
gress in local government elections last
month and has now earned the right
to be taken as a serious force poli-
tically and emotionally, if not intel-
lectually.
The Scot Nats work hard at being
very nice Nats. Mrs. Winifred Ewing,
who gained Hamilton, is everyone’s
Scottish Bluebell; the organiser, Mr.
lan Macdonald, is a typical Caledonian
executive from Singer or Shell; and
there are reassuring photographs about
of office-bearers with pleasantly demo-
cratic countenances. The movement
does not rely on “great men” —which
is sensible enough because it doesn’t
have any. Nor has it time for fire-
brands: the “1320 Club,” devoted to
the memory of the Declaration of
Arbroath, has been excommunicated
root and branch and with it the famous
Hugh McDiarmid, Scotland’s best-
known living poet. (This communist-
nationalist is unusual in having written
a series of “Hymns to Lenin” and for
his “Who’s Who” entry: “Recreation:
Anglophobia.”)
Mrs. Ewing is careful to stress the
natural friendship of the Scots and
English, on and off the platform. The
Scottish National Party’s central tactic
is clearly to minimise separatism’s con-
stitutional and political difficulties.
The doctrine is that the SNP has only
to win a majority of seats and votes in
Scotland and the trick will be done.
The United Kingdom Parliament would
then simply be asked to set up a
sovereign Scottish legislature and the
Union of 1707 would be at an end. If
Westminster declined, the SNP would
invite all other Scottish MPs to form
a provisional Scottish government
loyal to the crown. But the need for a
UDI is not expected: the English people,
with the Welsh in their van, will wave
the Scots an enthusiastic God-speed.
The party is, however, very much
anti-London. The public argument
concerns Westminster’s neglect of Scot-
tish interests. But there is, one suspects,
an underlying aversion to the cultural
tendencies of the south-east: swinging
London is not really in the Scots
tradition, and the SNP would be happy
to sail the Scottish ship of state into
waters unpolluted by certain English
effluents. Racial feeling is only the
latest of them. There are only 5000
colored people in Glasgow and a
sovereign Scotland would control all
immigration. Above all, perhaps, Eng-
land is no more either the avenue to
an empire in which the Scots could
have a mission of their own or the
mainspring of economic opportunity—
which it still seemed to be in the days
of the last Nationalist agitation in the
late 1940 s and early 19505.
The Scottish National Party stands on
the slogan: “Put Scotland First.” The
only road to a new Scottish nationhood
is the political one: “We turn envious
eyes on the spacious cities of the little
lands which ought, by all the arguments
of the Westminster politicians, to be
poor and wretched. We think of Stock-
holm, Oslo, and Amsterdam. And then
compare Glasgow and Edinburgh and
the other places with wretched slums.”
It is with Scandinavia and the “little
lands” that the SNP wishes to be close,
and it often cites Norway as the classic
example of a country that liberated it-
self from its larger neighbor and found
prosperity for all its regions. (So un-
like the fate of the Scottish Highlands.)
The SNP complains particularly bitterly
Winifred Ewing...a nice Nationalist
that the British Aircraft Corporation
have cut Scandinavian Airlines System
flights through Prestwick.
The SNP has plainly reached a first
peak. It has doubled its membership
every year recently and can now claim
over 100,000 members (an unknown
number of them under 16). It put up
23 candidates in the general election of
1966 and will fight all the 71 seats in
Scotland next time. The “Glasgow
Herald” has examined its social com-
position, taking a sample of 81 of the
309 municipal candidates this May.
They are mostly small businessmen,
shopkeepers, or skilled tradesmen who
have joined up within the past three
years and belonged previously to no
other Party. Higher education is the
exception among these candidates. Their
newness to politics shows the grass-roots
character of the SNP.
But the Party is still a protest move-
ment at least as much as an affirma-
tion of Scottish nationhood. It seems
to express a total disenchantment with
the workings of British Government,
and to canalise a search for new forms
of democracy. The leadership, it is
true, is vague in its political science.
But this does not alter the fact of the
malaise, general to Britain but felt
most acutely in Scotland. The former
Liberal leader, Mr. Jo Grimond, has
called for a new political structure in
aid of the' Scottish “democratic intel-
lect,” and has attempted to define such
a structure, with the approval of the
“Scotsman.” But Mr. Grimond, unlike
the SNP, accepts the union with Eng-
land. It is a safe bet that the cry for
greater devolution will be on many
Conservative, Labor, and Liberal lips
from now on. (But the Liberals, who
first worked at it, have been trounced
as badly as Labor.) The Tories’ pri-
vate plans seem more devolutionist
than anything yet accepted by Labor
—although Mr. Crossman has been
working at it. Among the Nationalists
no intellectuals as yet seem to have
thought all the way through to a new
political deal. Their strength lies in
their emotive assertions about the
London-based Parties. Without this
stance perhaps the SNP could not exist.
The SNP’s attempts at economics rely
heavily on the confident use of non-
statistics leading to what look sus-
piciously like un-arguments. It says,
for instance, that Scottish exports to
the outside world are such and such,
and that therefore there would be no
balance-of-payments problem for a
sovereign Scotland. Evidently it relies
on the undoubted facts that whisky
exports have risen, and that the value
added by Scottish assembly industries
has grown; but no statistics for all
Scottish exports or imports exist—
simply because there is no record of the
Scottish trade moving through English
ports. That, naturally, is another cause
for complaint. But the big hidden point
here is that Scotland clearly runs a
balance-of-payments deficit with Eng-
land. This inevitably causes a defla-
tionary bias in Scotland. Within the
United Kingdom, most economists
would say, this is partially offset by
subsidisation from England through
regional policies. The Scottish Nation-
alists do not seem to counter this by
wild claims of alternative policies open
to an independent country (no non-
sense about import controls at the
Tweed or a floating Scottish pound)
but by denying the subsidy exists.
Indeed, the SNP claims that Scot-
land subsidises England by £l7O mil-
lion a year, which figure is the differ-
ence between Scottish revenue receipts
and central government expenditure in
Scotland. Parliamentary questions have
more recently unearthed the information
that Scotland, with 9.76 percent of the
British population, receives 12 percent
of the “identifiable expenditure.” The
Nationalists had simply left out of their
reckoning the other 34.5 percent of
central government expenditure which
goes to military defence, servicing the
national debt, and certain other heads
of central spending. It is here that

any serious argument about what the
Nationalists could do ought to start.
There seems to be no argument that
Scotland could gain fiscally from sep-
aration from the rest of the United
Kingdom unless it repudiated the
servicing of its share of the national
debt or virtually obliterated defence
expenditure. Neither action is unknown
to new countries. The SNP guesses that
Scotland now contributes £2OO million
a year to defence and proposes a 40
to 50 percent cut. This would
apparently mean a tiny air force, a
tiny navy, and an Irish-type army,
which the SNP would like to be able
to offer for United Nations peace-keep-
ing missions. Protection of fishing
grounds would be a priority task for
the forces of free Scotland. The SNP
would demand the liquidation of all
Polaris bases and depots, which it re-
gards as menaces to the Scottish people.
All in all, these defence proposals come
very near to neutralism, which is per-
haps one reason why the Communist
Party supports separatism. Yet it is
not certain that this defence policy
would ultimately prevail within the
SNP: a strong section has more pride
in Scotland’s military prowess.
The objections to the SNP’s economic
assertions are, however, really sub-
merged in the general resentment arising
from Scotland’s special and serious eco-
nomic problems. In October, 1966,
Scottish employees in the leading indus-
tries were earning 14s. sd. per week less
than the national average and 375. 6d.
less than in the south-east of England.
Despite the new industries introduced
under the Local Employment Act during
the past eight years, the country is
suffering from the decline of coalmining
and shipbuilding and difficulties over
the assimilation of re-trainees. For three
years running the population has fallen
absolutely by 45,000 in 1966-67. This
is serious because of the high proportion
of young married graduate emigrants,
who, moreover, go increasingly outside
Britain and are thus probably lost for
ever. Scotland used to accept this, but
now the SNP gets a cheer when it insists
that Scots must be able to work in
Scotland. Yet the situation is much
better than in 1960. Scotland is catching
England up in prosperity and, granted
success to present regional policies,
should be roughly in line within a
decade. Perhaps the rise of the SNP
will impel Westminster to give Scotland
a still higher priority. But perhaps not:
the north of England is still less pros-
perous than Scotland’s central belt.
The Scots, as the world knows, are
canny. One of them has said that SNP
stands for Somewhat Naive Person. The
next two years will show whether the
London-based Parties will credibly offer
enough prosperity and administrative
devolution to take the edge off the SNP’s
drive for self-determination. The Eng-
lish, who do not often think of Scot-
land, will have to wake up if they want
to keep a United Kingdom.

It's only 50 years ago that Electrolytic
Zinc Company produced the first high
grade zinc in Australia now each
year Australia uses more zinc per head
of population than any other country
in the world. Around twice as much in
fact. In that time E.Z.’s experience,
its attention to product quality and
service, and its development of valuable
overseas markets have made it a great
earner for Australia and Australians.
E.Z. plans to keep it that way.

BUSINESS AND THE ECONOMY
Oil incentives on the cheap
NO MATTER how ,big are the prin-
ciples at stake in the oil incentive fuss,
the biggest thing about the affair is
the money it would cost if Australia
provided all its own petrol. Even tak-
ing the modest (and more likely) esti-
mates of how much the 75 cents a
barrel oil search incentative would cost
petrol consumers if it were passed on
(of 2 or 3 cents a gallon), the total in-
volved works out at between $lOO
million and $l5O million a year. An
addition of such an amount to transport
costs is no joke; but neither is the
prospect that the incentive may be
withdrawn.
Clearly some sort of answer to this
problem will have to be found by the
time the present system of incentive
payments to Australian searchers ex-
pires in 1970. There are plenty of
answers already suggested or soon to be
put up: the Government has an expert
from Britain working on the whole
question; last week Ampol Petroleum’s
chief, W. M. Leonard, outlined a
scheme he favors that puts the cost of
incentatives on to taxpayers as a whole
instead of the motorist or freighter;
and there is plenty of free advice com-
ing in from the various interested
parties, and the Press.
Hovering behind this discussion is
the real need for Australia to find a
lot more oil yet (current proven re-
serves which should provide 60 percent
of our needs by 1971 will probably
last little more than 15 years); the in-
centives have not yet resulted in Aus-
tralia discovering a big enough oilfield
to be able to become self-sufficient.
By 1971, Australian oil consumption
is expected to rise from the current
420,000 barrels a day to 480,000 barrels
of which 285,000 barrels will come from
local wells (240,000 from Bass Strait,
35,000 barrels from Barrow, and 10,000
barrels from Moonie-Alton).
At the same time, the international
oil companies that are complaining so
bitterly about the local incentive pay-
ments (and that have reported such
magnificent profits in recent weeks)
have a vested interest in discouraging
the too-hasty development of the Aus-
tralian oil industry, particularly while
they have large reserves in foreign
cheap-producing and less-stable areas
of the world that they want to use up
as fast as they can.
It seems vital to encourage them to
increase their Australian search (unless,
of course, the Government is prepared
to try to do even more to encourage
local explorers). It seems partly to be
the massive profits that the drilling
subsidies, incentive payments, and tax
rebates will help to bring that are
encouraging so many international oil
marketing giants to spend so much
looking for oil in (and off) Australia.
But, perhaps, these are not encour-
agement enough to the internationals.
Although the search is still going on
here, it is not at too hectic a pace. The
offshore search has quietened down a
bit following the disappointments at
Ashmore Reef, off the Queensland
coast, and off South Australia.. And in
January there were 25 on-shore oil
drilling rigs idle in Australia with only
16 active (and some of them were on
developmental wells rather than
exploratory ones). Things may warm up
a bit later this year, but there is no
doubt that the search could be more
energetically pursued by many of the
international majors who have spent
more money knocking down houses to
build service stations than in looking
for oil.
How, then, to maintain their interest
in looking for our oil without it costing
the Australian consumer or taxpayer
too much? The Ampol plan is all very
well, but it does line foreign oil com-
panies’ pockets with Australian tax-
payers’ money for, despite all the
talk about the Australian stake in the
search for oil, the bulk of the effort
has been paid for by foreign oil com-
panies and they stand to make the
biggest profits.
But, with Ampol, an Australian-
owned company, acting as a retailer,
a refiner, and a discoverer of oil, Mac
Leonard’s proposal merits attention. It
is for the price of Australian crude oil
to retain the 25 cents a barrel (36 im-
perial gallons) quality differential over
imported crudes, and for the 75 cents
a barrel incentive payment to be re-
placed by taxation concessions of up to
50 cents depending on distance from
The drills need wanning up again
refineries, and an extra 10 cents depend-
ing on the size of the oilfield. Some re-
ports from Canberra say that the Gov-
ernment is not likely to accept such a
proposal.
Possibly a more realistic method
might be to provide some incentive of
a more persuasive kind, by forcing the
oil marketing companies further into
the search for oil. This could be done
by making them, as marketers, absorb
a large part of the incentive cost (say
1 cent a gallon, or $5O million a year).
Since this incentive payment is to be
paid to those oil marketing companies
that are successful searchers for oil (in
addition to being sellers of it) this
would mean that the oil companies
would be paying the cash out of the
left hand into the right provided
they had been energetic enough to have
a right hand (in other words, a pro-
ducing oil well).
Now, it could be argued that this
would be an unfair penalty on those
oil companies that had spent a lot of
cash on the search for oil in Australia,
but had not been blessed with enough
luck to find one. The reply to this could
be that finding oil these days is more
a matter of techniques than luck; of
hard work and big spending rather than
wildcatting.
On the other hand, the return from
Barrow Island or Moonie-Alton would
clearly not be enough to encourage
other searchers without the payment
of the incentive (and some experts say
that had Barrow’s reservoirs been dis-
covered offshore instead of on the
island, the extra costs involved would
have made its economics look pretty
sick even with the incentive payment).
So there is clearly some need for a
differential in the positive side of any
encouragement (through tax conces-
sions, incentive payments, or what-have-
you) to fit the conditions of discoveries;
to that extent the Ampol suggestions
sound like good sense.
Of course, there are difficulties with
this sort of approach; apart from pos-
sibly discouraging some searchers from
trying to upgrade their fields by being
content to remain on a small scale and
get whatever incentive is going, it could
also mean an uneconomic development
of many small oilfields that would not
otherwise be worth opening up (parti-
cularly if bigger, richer ones are sub-
sequently found).
These are risks that should be taken;
worrying about them is like trying to
. run before you can walk. And in the
oil business, Australia is still on its
hands and knees.
One important side-effect to the in-
creasing flow of Australian oil is its
effect on the structure of the non-
petroleum side of the industry. In the


first place, the oil refineries will have
to spend large sums changing over to
be able to accept the much lighter Aus-
tralian crudes that produce far fewer
by-products (and much more petro-
leum) than the heavy Middle-East
crudes they were built to refine.
This will give the Government the
opportunity of discovering a coherent
fuel policy; there have been many sug-
gestions that petroleum users have in
effect been subsidising residual oil prices
and enabling these oils to undercut
other fuels that are locally available.
The whole question of pricing policies
for oil, natural gas, and coal can now
get the sort of attention it ought to
have had years ago.
Underdeveloped, countries
Trade difficulties
TRADE NOT AID has become this
slogan of underdeveloped countries in
their claims for a better deal. The
problems of repaying loans have become
so great that many poor countries get
extremely annoyed when loan finance is
described as “economic aid.”
When Mrs. Gandhi spoke to the Aus-
tralian Government this week it was
trade that she concentrated on. It is
not so easy for poor countries to in-
crease their exports. In the case of
India there is evidently a feeling that
to keep the Chinese buying our wheat
we are being very lenient with them
in their sale of manufactured exports
by not fully enforcing anti-dumpingr
regulations. Even without this sort of
barrier (if the Indians are right in their
claim) poor countries are up against it.
For many of the agricultural products
which they can readily export the terms
of trade run against them as synthetics
are substituted for the natural product.
And import restrictions or floating
tariffs often apply in large markets
such as Japan, the Common Market,
or the U.S.
The manufactured products which
they can most readily produce are
generally the very ones which are most
heavily protected by tariffs in industrial
countries.
Even if Australia’s system of pref-
erential tariffs on selected exports from
underdeveloped countries has been of
token significance because of its small
size, its principle has gained Australia
enormous prestige.
A World Bank economist, Mr. Barend
de Vries, has examined the relative per-
formance of different underdeveloped
countries in export performance. His
conclusions are rather general (the
World Bank has to be diplomatic). He
finds that those countries which have
specialised in industry have done better
than those which have aimed at self-
sufficiency. South Korea, Taiwan, and
Jamaica have been particularly success-
ful and they have concentrated on light
industry.
MEN AND MATTERS
TWENTY-THREE years ago, when he
was 50 (an age at which many men
are beginning to think about retiring),
Ken Higgins decided he was sick of
working for someone else and decided
to be his own boss. So, after long dis-
cussions with his wife and two daugh-
ters, Nola and Pam, he quit his job
as an executive of W. C. Douglass (the
food company taken over by Cerebos
of Britain five years ago), mortgaged
the family home, its contents, and the
car and invested $lB,OOO in a venture
that has since blossomed into Big Sister
Foods Ltd. Last week this business, that
earned $250 in its first year of trading,
was valued at about $5 million by the
British Reckitt and Colman group,
which is using it as a vehicle for “back-
door listing” of its Australian opera-
tions. (As Big Sister goes out by the
same sort of back door it came in,
Big Sister shareholders will end up
owning 14 percent of a big listed com-
pany, to be called Reckitt and Colman
Australia Ltd., of which the Big Sister
operation will be a part.)
For to start Big Sister in the war-
time days of capital issues controls of
February, 1945, Ken Higgins had
bought the company structure of Lillis
Treloar, a defunct country retail store
in Barraba, N.S.W. His first contract,
after he started up in a factory in Barr
Street, Balmain (still the site of the
company’s operations), in March of that
year, was to supply the U.S. Army with
breakfast foods. But this ended soon
after when the shooting stopped.
His first real break came shortly
afterwards with an order for 5000 cases
of canned plum puddings for Army can-
teens in India that no one else seemed
to want. With a very fine recipe, but
no equipment, he promised delivery in
seven weeks. The first five weeks were
spent in making things to make the
puddings with; the last two in making
the puddings in a round-the-clock rush.
Nola handled the paper work and
spent any spare time with a hammer,
nailing down cases in the factory, where
the family spent weekends.
Post-war shortages and red-tape
nearly put them out of business but the
late John Beasley, then Minister for
Supply, was unexpectedly sympathetic
to their enterprise because “it is a long
time since the Australian public had
been able to buy plum pudding,” so
he added plum puds to the permissible
tin-plate list.
The company, then called Lillis and
Co. Ltd., went on the Sydney Stock
Exchange in 1950 with issued capital of
$200,000. One par jssue and four bonus
issues later (not forgetting the
employees: a premium issue to them in
1967 to honor his creed of watching the
interests of those who devote their lives
to building the business) paid capital
has grown to $694,355.
The company’s name was changed to
Big Sister in 1958 for complete identi-
fication with its trade-mark, which had
been such a winner, and whose selection
had caused the family so many sleep-
less nights in 1945 until Higgins hit
on the family nickname for his elder
daughter.
Big Sister has grown up, and Ken
Higgins, now 73, could retire happy in
the knowledge that “If a man’s work
abides which he has built, thereupon he
shall receive a reward” (a saying of St.
Paul’s which Higgins is wont to quote).
But rumor has it that, apart from his
family, which includes seven grand-
children, the business is his whole life,
and that an early retirement is not
contemplated.
THE OTHER side of this takeover
penny is Reckitt and Colman, and a
lot has been going on there in recent
times. In the midst of its Big Sister
manoeuvres, Reckitt and Colman is
charging leaders with the appointment
of Bernard T. Jones, a 48-year-old Mel-
burnian, as chairman and chief execu-
B. T. Jones
Ken Higgins
tive at the end of June, when Jack
Edwards retires from these posts (to
stay on as director).
Under his chairmanship, Reckitt and
'Colman expanded rapidly by adding
Holbrooks (sauces), Planters (nuts),
Goya-Decore (cosmetics and toiletries),
Bourne (floor treatments), and Zippy
(household products) to its original
business of Keen’s mustard and Reck-
itt’s blue.
The Zippy lines, liquid starch, deter-
gents, insecticides, and window cleaners,
came with the acquisition in Australia
of Bernard Jones Australia Ltd., a firm
begun by Bernard Jones, the new chief.
Then, in 1949-50, he obtained the Zippy
liquid-starch licence from an American
woman in Philadelphia.
He started up companies interstate,
and a plastic company making plastic
closures and bottles, Robunt Pty. Ltd.,
which was eventually disposed of to
Containers Ltd. When he sold out to
Reckitt and Colman, Bernard Jones
Australia Ltd. had paid capital of
$70,000.
Jones, born in Melbourne, was
schooled at Xavier College. Now living
at St. Ives, a strong involvement at
home with a family of five children
allow him only membership of the
American Club and a game of golf at
Pennant Hills outside working hours.

Management
Buying economies
IT IS A PITY that so many branches
of the management sciences should labor
under forbidding esoteric names, for
they mostly contain sound common-
sense suggestions which could pay off
handsomely whether acted upon in an
area of free trade or a hot-house pro-
tectionism. Who, for example, would
immediately associate “utility rate
analysis with lopping a hefty amount
of the electricity bill and not so much
* S A switch the lights off notice in
sight And yet a two-year-old Australian
consultant company on this particular
practice American-born NUS Inter-
national is already claiming to have
reduced the electricity and water bills
of industry here by $120,000 a year. .
The company’s point of departure is
that only very big consumers negotiate
their tariff terms with the supply auth-
orities and all the rest must choose what-
ever they think best from the selection
offered—and often fail to choose the
most advantageous.
One can only presume that the public
utilities do not want to make this extra
profit—even though the tariffs, parti-
cularly in electricity, seem to grow
more complex daily—any more than the
tax man would dream of cutting one
iota more than his pound of flesh
(which he wouldn’t get away with any-
way). So one concludes that the free
advisory services provided by the public
utilities are not all that they should
be and that, for the majority of com-
panies, such tariffs remained veiled in
a mystery which NUS delights in un-
ravelling.
Another, more complex, method of
cost saving is advocated by Value
Engineering Ltd., under the title of
“value analysis.” This is founded on the
assumption that there can always be
found a better (and cheaper) way of
doing almost anything.
Value analysis assumes that unneces-
sary costs can creep into a product
through a lack of information on new
materials, new processes, or new prod-
ucts, because of a lack of communica-
tion within a firm or whatever; that
the first workable solution to a problem
is too often the one permanently
adopted; that there is a negative atti-
tude at work in management toward
learning from experience and that often
the mental blocks of “too difficult,”
“too demanding,” “too expensive,” or
just “bloody impossible” are the first
barriers needing to be overcome.
A particularly pertinent example of
the successful application of value
analysis from the Australian point of
view was the way General Electric used
it to compete with the Japanese tran-
sistors which flooded U.S. markets in
1961. The company managed not only
to underprice Japanese radios in the
U.S. but with some of its lines was
able to compete on the Japanese market.
It is cheering to think of Value
Engineering organising workshop sem-
inars to sweep away a few Australian
cobwebs.
Foreign investment
Danish export base
DANISH FOOD company East
Asian is further extending its interest
in the Melbourne-based and -listed
Harvest Food with the idea of making
it the base for the world-wide export
of its brand products with the “Plum-
rose” label. It has upped its share of
Harvest Foods’ equity from 50 to 60
percent as a preliminary, and by
October this company will be ready
to go into export action.
Its main idea in getting a bigger
foothold in Australia is that the econ-
omies of canning meat for world export
make this a far better place to do it
profitably than Denmark, the avail-
ability of beef and pork is better here,
and, of course, exports from Australia
enjoy preference in the British market.
Apparently Australian United Corpora-
tion is in full agreement and sympathy
with all this, being solidly behind the
financing.


The Croesus Touch
TAKING THE SIDE OF
GOLD IN A
WORLD GONE HAYWIRE
BY J. C. HORSFALL
WADING THROUGH BOOKS on
international liquidity, the balance of
payments, gold take your pick,
there are plenty about in these topsy-
turvy days when students of these and
other subjects should be burning the
midnight oil over them instead of spend-
ing their weekends blocking the traffic
may mark one as an old fossil, a
“square,” or whatever the modern term
is for not being an anarchist.
Of the four such books on my desk
at the moment I’ve no hesitation in say-
ing that for anybody wanting to get
behind the scenes of the international
monetary world the biography of Mon-
tague Norman, by Andrew Boyle, men-
tioned here last week, is the most use-
ful. It gives you all you want by way
of historical factors leading up to the
present circus, as well as unmasking one
of the most fabulous mystery men of
all time in the international financial
play.
For an account of the part of the
unloved American dollar as a reserve
currency and the role of U.S. balance
■of payments’ deficits in furnishing the
world with capital and international
liquidity since the war, R. V. Roosa’s
“The Dollar and World Liquidity” has
text-book qualities, and the pros and
cons of the role of gold couldn’t be
better treated than in the National In-
dustrial Conference Board’s “Gold and
World Monetary Problems.”
When you get a blow-up like the pres-
ent one in France, it’s no use saying
that “business must go on” and that to
oil the world’s monetary works, especi-
ally the cogs connecting domestic activi-
ties in the various countries with their
outside trade and financial outworkings,
only a rational approach is needed.
Maybe if you’re in a country like Aus-
tralia, far from the maddening messes
on the other side of the world, the ivory-
tower approach to economic problems
can be indulged out of earshot of
industrial turmoil and the speculative
currency play. But let’s face it, we
Indulge it under the illusion that a
detached approach to currency prob-
lems could be an expensive luxury in
the world as it is, rolling around us
In boisterous confusion.
For France—and even for de Gaulle
one can plead that in their recent
espousal of the virtues of a gold stan-
dard it is not quite as old-fashioned as
it sounds. Their conception is a big
advance on Montague Norman’s form-
ula hidebound by Victorian vintage
ideas of a low, inviolate gold price. To
them a modern gold standard geared
to full employment objectives and re-
lated to general price levels as they
have evolved in an inflationary world
left gasping from wartime pressures on
resources would leave the old one
for dead. Also, in advocating such a
standard they show a better historical
sense than those who want to launch
us on to a sea of international paper
money buoyed merely by the theory that
anything can be as good as gold and
the fashion in thinking that an ordered
gold routine is old hat. It is worth a
thought that automatic regulation of
domestic economic activity might just
be a shade better than a free-for-all in
balance of payments deficits.
Vive la Bastille! Whatever French
heads go to the chopping block in this
enlightened age when the miracle has
happened in economic management and
the Sirens sing for chancellors of ex-
chequers sailing between Charybis and
Scylla, it is to be hoped that at least
somebody is left to speak up and say
that automatic regulation of domestic
activities in tune with a gold standard
has something to be said for it in cir-
cumstances where the world has gone
haywire. Do you want to take sides?
Forgive me. I am all for the enlight-
ened approach to economic and finan-
cial affairs, but I also rememiber my
Cambridge tutors, Sir Dennis Robert-
son, for instance, who, for the life of
him, could never admit to himself that
the world inspired by the philosophies
and economic calculae of J. M. Keynes
was going to be an easy one to handle,
that is, if it could be handled at all
with any certainty about the result. To
be frank, I feel that Robertson has been
proved right, even if nobody can gain-
say with any confidence that for all its
stumbling blocks and cleverly disguised
inflationary pressures the modern
world is surprisingly well run.
Maybe the modern world isn’t seek-
ing alibis. Why should it? Everybody
who wants to be employed seems to be
these days, and if the pay’s not right
he’ll be in good company going on
strike, or biding his time with the
payers, to get a bit more, no holds
barred. It is all a matter of high con-
venience, with the State, under
pressure from those who have never
had it so good, feeling its ways to
assuring the continuance of economic
satisfaction for everybody when their
time for work is up, which is something
industry should already be adjusting its
investment decisions to, not that the
writing is yet writ all that large on
the social services wall.
Six months ago we were preening
ourselves because the late Harold Holt,
who was about the most “go-go” Prime
Minister we’re likely to have (if not in
his day as treasurer, the most generous
one we can think of and certainly not
as profligate as McMahon), elected to
cock a snoot at Sterling. In staying put
on its devaluation, he could take into
account that, among other things, we
hadn’t the heavy reserve currency
pressures on our back as Britain had,
and also the Treasury’s and Reserve
Bank’s confidence that it would be
helpful if their fiscal and monetary
policies were countered by some sub-
traction from exporters’ incomes. In
the circumstances, it would be much
Storm centre the Paris gold market
easier to play our external currency
cards on soft pedal as an antidote to-
local credit excesses. The conjecture
of happenings suited the Government
fine, as well as attracting some kudos
in its direction.
Since then the liberality of monetary
policy has continued with even more
abandon than before. The question
hasn’t been whether the price of money
is right or wrong but whether the
economy is getting all the credit it
wants to keep it buoyant. Letting the
trading banks do leasing finance is just
the latest instalment. No thought of any
day of credit reckoning. In these easy-
money circumstances it seems the
monetary authorities have forgotten
that the rate of interest could be
brought into the play and all the more
effectively in current circumstances of
relatively stable prices.
How much longer this will be delayed
is anybody’s guess. Nobody is saying-
the Australian dollar is getting into
bad shape, as yet, though some peculiar
things have been happening to capital
inflow, its main support, lately. Mr.
McMahon was as happy about every-
thing as a sandboy at the Melbourne
Jaycees’ lunch last week. Not a thought
of any internal monetary pressures
putting strains on the balance of pay-
ments, even well under the surface.
So, if the Australian dollar is not over-
valued (take away capital inflow and
see what you get!) why take credit
creating and Government spending off
their carefree courses? The situation
is loaded with imponderables.
The Adam in us is, of course, very
strong at the moment. “And why not?”'
you may ask. Our material and
apparent currency strengths and
relatively quiet industrial scene are
the envy of many an overseas currency.
For once in a while we don’t have to
call any overseas Eve “madam,” at
least as politely or as often as we used'
to do. But while the going is good, it
is just as well to ask—and to keep on
asking—how long we can carry on in
our present carefree monetary fashion
without making our dollar any more
vulnerable to the currency storms
raging in other parts of the world. If
these are eventually going to hit us
they could start doing so without much
notice. In that case it would be right
to be taking out some new insurances.

NCR breaks the price-barrier on computers
with the Century Series through
new technology and automated manufacture.
ceriiui
■'/.I

NCR Century computers are the result of years of intensive
research and planning ... the co-ordinated efforts of Engineers,
Technicians, Manufacturing Personnel, Programmers, and
System Analysts. To produce the most advanced computer with
a real breakthrough in cost/performance ratio, NCR employs
the latest developments in miniaturization, standardization and
automation.
Standardization has allowed NCR to capitalize on mass produc-
tion methods without sacrificing reliability. The Century Series
uses only one monolithic integrated circuit as the base element
for all processor and peripheral logic. Six configurations of this
circuit handle all logical functions for processing data. In con-
trast to other systems which use up to 1,200 different types of
printed circuit boards, the Century uses only 81 different circuit
boards, of which 80% are the six standard configurations.
This reduction in number of circuits also results in faster, low-
cost maintenance. Using new hardware/software diagnostic
techniques, service personnel complete their checks quickly.
Standardization of logic simplifies training of service engineers.
Fewer circuits and standardized logic also mean reduced parts
inventory. In effect, a service engineer can keep all spare parts
for logic functions in his desk drawer.
New automated manufacturing techniques mean higher produc-
tion volumes and lower cost per unit. Fully automated fabrication
of the Century’s thin-film, short-rod memory contrasts sharply
with the more costly hand operations involved in the stringing
of the less efficient core memory used in most other computers.
One standard memory plane is used to fabricate all memory
modules. Circuits are inserted on cards, soldered, and tested
by completely automated processes.
These modern production methods contribute to the exception-
ally low cost of the new NCR Century computers. NCR invites you
to begin your investigation today. Call your local NCR office
or write to NCR, Box 2626, G.P.0., Sydney, 2001.
Never before so much performance
at so low a cost.

Speculator’s Diary
MEDIUM-AND LONG-TERM
INVESTMENTS
IN THE RETAILING TRADE
DO YOU EVER wonder when the idea
of a stock, exchange was first born?
Well, it appears that although there
has been bartering, trading, and
wheeling-dealing since Adam was a boy
the concept of joint stock companies
and stock exchanges in anything like
the form we know them today was not
hit upon until the late sixteenth cen-
tury. The Dutch were the first to try
it, and there are still records in
Amsterdam today of stock lists that
were dealt with in 1585. The English
were next to catch on, and somewhere
around the 1670 s the'first London Stock
Exchange went into business. Trading,
however, in those days wasn’t quite as
we know it today. In London, for in-
stance, stocks were issued by auction, a
candle being lit when auction began and
the lists only being left open for as
long as it took one inch of candle to
burn away. (Imagine the sort of prices
Silver Valley would attract under those
conditions today!)
The securities themselves were also
somewhat different. In fact, in some
dealings the securities were not repre-
sented by documents at all but tally
sticks—made of willow, normally four
to five feet long and about one inch
square. Notches would be marked on
three sides of the stick indicating the
amount and number of units involved
in the deal. The stick would then be
split in half through the notches and
the new shareholder would be given
one side as security. When the share-
holder wished to sell his shares he would
merely take his half of the stick along
to the company secretary, who would
match it up with the company’s corres-
ponding half and then pay out the
current market value of the shares.
If the notches didn’t tally up—no deal.
An advantage of this system was that
if a company ever went bung and its
shares became worthless, the scrip
could then be used for firewood.
A company that looks as though it
could be in line for a very much
improved result this year is Waltons
Ltd., the largest retailer of home wares
in Australia. The company operates
stores, over sixty of them in all, in
Queensland, New South Wales, Vic-
toria, Australian Capital Territory, and
South Australia (the latter being
through its partly owned subsidiary
Miller Anderson). Over the last few
years the company has been indulging
in a bit of profitless growth not
uncommon amongst retailers. Since
1963, despite impressive physical ex-
pansion, the company’s earning rate has
fallen by over 30 percent, and the price
pf its shares has come tumbling after.
The main reasons for the profit drop,
in chronological order, were the estab-
lishment of the company in Victoria,
the launching of a major department
store in Bourke Street, Melbourne, and
the absorption of the Marcus Clark
group into the fold. However, all prob-
lems now seem to be in the past and
the company looks to be going well with
no apparent clouds on the horizon. In
fact, Waltons now looks poised to reap
the benefits of its past battles. This year
it is generally expected that profits with
the help of some tax losses from Marcus
Clark will return somewhere around
20 percent on capital as compared to
just over 17 percent last year. Always
being interested in companies that look
as though they are going to increase
their profits by 15 percent, I bought 300
at 95 cents. Incidentally, the fact that
retail sales are running at about 8 per-
cent higher this year than last won’t
hurt this company’s chances, either.
On the subject of retailers, a favorite
of mine that I’ve never had in the port-
folio because it’s more of a long-term
investment than a short one is Lowes.
This company is a beauty. It specialises
in men’s wear, boys’ wear, profits and
bonus issues. It has been in the selling
game for seventy years and twenty of
these as a public company. In the
whole time that it has been on the
public lists it has not once asked share-
holders for a nickel. Despite this, paid
capital has still grown by almost one
million dollars. This has been almost
solely due to bonus issues. Last year
the company paid a dividend of 12.5
percent and earned a record profit (an-
other one) of $317,000. This year it has
already made one-for-four bonus issue,
and even on increased capital last year’s
profit still shows a return of 26 percent.
And despite its new issue the company
still has $2 million in reserves. From all
angles, Lowes looks good. I would thor-
oughly recommend it to anyone looking
for a good long-term investment.
Now that the smoke has cleared,
Juanita has lost her valiantly fought
battle, and Mark Foys has finally
accepted the offer from McDowells, I
have decided to sell off my holding.
This little deal which tied up my funds
for a bare month and a half earned
me a net 13.5 percent. In cash terms
the profit was $47. Three cheers for
Juanita.

Now it is oil’s turn
MINING • SHARE LIST • BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS
MARKET POINTERS • SECURITY ANALYSIS • COMMODITIES
By JASON
GET INTO the oil market. There is
a lot of good sense behind the London
view (backed with its cash) that oil
stocks are the next ones due for a good
run here, to swing attention away from
hopes of pie in the sky (or silver in
the valley) in the mineral market.
It has been astounding that the oil
market has held up so well in recent
months, in view of the lack of activity.
Our oil table on page 50 shows that
there were only 11 exploratory oil
wells being drilled in Australia last
week, and seven of them came from
only two groups, Esso-BHP and Wapet.
In fact, there should be a lot more
happening to stimulate the market in
coming months, particularly offshore,
where the newcomer Abrolhos Oil (in
which Longreach has a stake) is about
to drill a stratigraphic well (but which
could nevertheless hold oil hopes);
where Woodside and Mid Eastern are
to have a slice of (and Amalgamated
Petroleum a 2\ percent royalty over) a
stratigraphic well north-east of Barrow
Island; and where Oil Search will soon
have its Ini well drilled for it by Esso.
Other offshore interest is in Beach
Petroleum’s New Zealand activities,
which look interesting (Beach also has
a stake in a well to be drilled by Aus-
tralian Aquitane in the W.A. part of
the Amadeus basin once the weather
clears up), and in the Alliance group’s
plans for a well in Bonaparte Gulf in
November (which will cost the group
nothing following its new partnership
arrangements).
All of these shares should go up as
the wells go down. And the same goes,
on a smaller scale, for the search on
land, which is also hotting up. The
Associated group keeps plugging away
in the Roma area, with Amalgamated
Petroleum having a stake in the current
well; AOG is drilling again in the Surat
basin; Exoil-Transoil are keeping a
close eye on Magellan’s neighboring
North-west Meerenie well to see if it
improves the economics of their gas
and oil deposits in the area, and are
about to drill in the Officer basin, 250
miles south-east of Meerenie; Inter-
state Oil is soon to drill three wells in
the Otway basin (as well as having a
wide spread of interests in other areas
such as western Papua, where it has a
farm-in agreement with Oil Search, the
Associated group, in which it has a 15
percent interest, and Santos, in which it
also has a small holding; Magellan has
announced a three-well program in
the Amadeus basin, in conjunction with
newly listed Southern Pacific Petroleum
and Farmout Drillers; Planet has an
extra $1 million to play with follow-
ing an issue to Australian Gas Light
Co.; Santos has been hfeld up by wet
weather, but is soon to drill again.
Something seems likely to be found as
a result of all this activity on and
off shore.
There are also side-benefits from buy-
ing some oil stocks. Exoil-Transoil’s
latest market run is the result of
minerals rather than oil (an announce-
ment is due this week); Amalgamated
Petroleum’s present status seems more
related to nickel than oil; the Asso-
ciated group’s coal reserves are a big
factor in its price; Planet’s uranium and
nickel hopes have caused its latest run;
Timor’s status is due to nickel.
THE CHARTIST comments further on
Cleveland Tin: This stock has broken
trend and is showing definite technical
weakness. It should be avoided by in-
vestors at present.
The Chartist says:
CSR has been very much a cyclical issue since 1960 but now appears to
be entering a new growth phase. The recent breakout from the consolidation
pattern formed after the peak of $5.40 in November, 1967, suggests a minimum
probable move to $7.80 with a higher target close to $8.40 for the longer term.
Last sale price on 23/5/68 $5.70.

ment of assets and liabilities, which
shows that the net amount (within an
assets total of $306.1 million) due to
related companies (including, mainly,
the U.K. parent) was reduced by $32.5
million to $180.5 million last year. That
the deduction was just under twice the
declared net profit is perhaps only a
coincidence, but it could mean that,
under pressure fro'm the U.K. Treasury,
Shell has, in fact, been obliged to
repatriate some of the golden eggs it’s
laid here over the year.
Shell says that a number of factors
contributed to its $14.8 million increase
in profit from the disclosed $2.7 million
result of 1966. One was that sales
volumes continued to increase, the net
proceeds figure was 10 percent above
1966, and the level of marketing and
administration expenditures was held to
an increase of 6 percent; second, that
Increased operating efficiencies in oil
and chemical manufacturing plants re-
sulted in plant throughput increases of
9 percent, while the operating costs (at
Barrow Island just as Ampol did) of
the plants rose by about 6 percent;
third, that the group enjoyed the benefit
of income ($3.4 million) from crude
oil production for the first time. Other
items affecting the 1967 profit include a
gain of $1.5 million realised on settle-
ment of pre-devaluation overseas debts,
the writing off of $0.7 million premiums
on acquisition of subsidiary companies
and $1 million of exploration expen-
diture related to inactive areas.
Other observations on the profit may
be made here. One is that close on $lO
million spent by the group on oil
exploration last year (mostly those ter-
ribly costly dry off-shore holes in the
Otway Basin) was charged to capital.
What is more the year’s taxation pro-
vision was cut to shreds by tax relief
of $5.9 million arising from investment
allowances and share subscriptions to
another oil exploration company. If
the latter hadn’t been available and if
oil search expenditure had been charged
against profits (presumably it was pro-
vided as capital inflow from Britain,
though this is a bit difficult to recon-
cile with the company’s $32.5 million
reduction in net indebtedness to
related companies) the group’s profit
would have been cut to a mere $1 mil-
lion or so.
Wouldn’t it be nice if Shell (and
all the other unlisted internationals
here) had annual Press conferences
when releasing profit statements like
Alcoa did the other day. If they are not
going to list their shares, this is the
least they can do. It should pay them to
do so if only to retain local interest
and respect.
WHATEVER MAY BE said in criti-
cism of the Slater Walker group’s in-
vasion in which it is clawing in Aus-
tralian listed companies right and left,
at least this Britain-based show has
given the Australian market the oppor-
tunity of getting in on its good things.
Nor has the local investor been at all
shy of jumping on the bandwagon.
Though shares have thus far only been
given a second room audience of brokers
they’ve been snapped up like hot cakes
in recent weeks and were heading
above $6 when we last heard of them.
It won’t be long before they’re pro-
moted to the first room league: the
odds are that having been allowed to
send so much money out here by the
Bank of England, Slater Walker will
be expected to bring home some good
lean bacon without too much delay to
stock up the U.K. balance of payments.
This could mean a liberal dividend
policy on the part of the local board
here.
Also they show Shell and all the
other preciously overseas-owned profit-
makers here what paths lie open to
placate our predilection for having a
stake in them. Rexal Drug and Chemi-
cal of the U.S. has now got a foothold
in Australia as a result of its recent $2O
million purchase of the Beauty Coun-
sellors group, which includes us in its
world-wide operations. Although it isn’t
quite what we’d prefer most, Rexal is
toying with the idea of forming a
trust company which would be listed
on Australian stock exchanges. In this
we would have a chance of sharing in
the results of the group’s universal oper-
ations. Some Melbourne underwriters
are apparently looking into its feasi-
bility.
E. A. WATTS have come up very
satisfactorily since we patted the com-
pany on the back for its good progress
a few months ago, though at the
moment the shares seem to have come
up against, a ceiling from which the
view to further heights is somewhat
obscured, the level being around $1.35,
at which they yield about percent
on dividend and just over 15 percent
on last year’s earnings rate (improved
on in the first half of this year). How-
ever, for investors who like these high
building flyers there’s good news and
the first part of it comes from Syd-
ney, where this Melbourne-based con-
cern has just landed three big con-
tracts worth in all $8.2 million to add
to its already fat order book. It has
the best of clients for these the
Royal Sydney Yacht Club, the Post-
Master General, the N.S.W. Milk
Board, and the Commonwealth Bank.
Plenty of prestige in that lot.
The other thing is that there could
be something in the idea of which
we’ve heard a whisper that Mr. A. V.
Jennings, who has recently been get-
ting on the high building steps, could
be more than merely looking at the
achievements of his friend Mr. Watts
with passing admiration for his high
endeavors. We’ll leave it at that for
the moment, but it wouldn’t surprise
this column one little bit if these two
stalwarts in the building industry ulti-
mately joined forces. Walking arm in
arm they would make a fine pair, and
if anybody’s shares would be ripe for
a rise in the eventuality of a merger
being effected, there’s no doubt that
it would be E. A. Watts.


Behind the balance sheets
Ralph McKay—after-the rains
IT IS AN almost classic investment
situation. Next year should be a
“beauty” for agricultural-equipment
maker Ralph McKay Ltd., but, at $1.40,
the stockmarket is now pricing its 50c
shares more on the basis of the current
year’s expected result (which should
be roughly in a line with last year’s
drought-affected earnings) than on
prospects for 1968-69. This time next
year (weather permitting) the shares
should be at least $l.BO, and the com-
pany should be moving toward a
record result and a possibly higher
dividend.
For the recent drought-breaking
rains should have washed away any
doubts about prospects of Ralph
McKay, whose main job is making
discs for ploughs, and, which managed
to hold its own remarkably well
through three droughty financial years
to 1967.
If it could average 26.3 percent earn-
ings in those unfavorable three years,
the chances are that 1967-68 results, due
late in July, will also be satisfactory.
The interim report told of steady pre-
tax profits, as higher costs negated the
6.7 percent sales increase. The effects
of drought were still being felt in the
early months of that half year, but
there was some upturn when seasonal
conditions improved in the later
months, and directors expected trading
to continue to improve in the second
half. The company should therefore be
going into the new financial year,
1968-69, with high hopes for the most
favorable seasonal conditions in years.
What carried Ralph McKay through
the difficult years so well was develop-
ment of export markets in 35 countries
of Asia, the Middle East, Africa, Central
America, and the west coast of South
America.
Basic wage and margins increases
and higher raw material costs make it
increasingly difficult to compete in
export markets, but the company has
been controlling costs well. In 1967,
the company indicated that exports
accounted for 15 to 20 percent of sales
volume.
It has been considering for some time
establishing overseas subsidiaries or
joint ventures to manufacture agricul-
tural equipment overseas, and, although
proposals were deferred for a time, the
company is still closely examining pro-
jects for Asia. In New Zealand, too,
a project to manufacture potato mach-
inery, mentioned in 1966, has also been
postponed by N.Z. Government restric-
tions on the import of raw materials,
and the present state of the N.Z.
economy does not lend hope to early
fulfilment of these manufacturing pro-
posals. *
The company makes discs and
coulters for agricultural implements,
forgings for general engineering pur-
poses, circular meat knives, pressings
and stampings at Maidstone, Victoria,
and cultivator points and tynes, and
potato machinery for planting, harvest-
ing, and grading, in Adelaide. The
points, the wearing parts, are sold as
original equipment to other implement
makers, and as replacement parts to
Ralph McKay’s own distributors.
One of the factors of Ralph McKay’s
success is its association with Borg
Warner of the U.S., dating from 1960.
The American company took up a 25.4
percent interest in the company, and
agreed to supply technical knowledge
for the manufacture of agricultural
implement parts. This included licen-
sing rights, automation layout, and
plant specifications.
Borg Warner’s Ingersoll Products
Division is the largest producer of discs
for agricultural implements in the
world, so Ralph McKay’s disc manu-
facturing plant incorporated the latest
know-how and patents used in the U.S.
by that company.
Borg Warner was issued 640,000 50c
shares which were to rank for dividends
after July, 1962, but delay caused by a
fire in the plant in 1961 meant a
change in arrangements, so that the
Borg Warner shareholding ranked for
dividend from January, 1964. So, only
in the last three years of the table
below, did these shares rank fully for
the whole year.
Ralph McKay does its own market-
ing in Victoria, N.S.W., and South
Australia, but has distributors else-
where.
The company has had adequate sup-
plies of all new materials, including
Australian-made steel, throughout
1967-68, and almost complete freedom
from industrial disputes, despite dis-
satisfaction within the unions about the
metal trades awards. But wages costs
have certainly gone up as a result of
the new awards.
A considerable amount has been spent
on extension of buildings and provision
of new plant in recent years, though
how much is not clear. In 1966-67
$123,000 was spent on buildings,
$273,000 on plant and machinery in
Melbourne and Adelaide. This was
carefully calculated to increase and
improve production, with reduction in
operating costs.
Whatever was spent on plant would
have brought tax relief in investment
allowances, and export rebates would
have also given tax benefits. However,
the past three years tax provisions
appear generous in relation to declared
profits, suggesting the company has been
conservative in its accounting, possibly
in being generous with depreciation, as
plant and equipment is depreciated to
52 percent of cost or valuation, and
some depreciation has been made on
buildings.
The company has further plans for
long-term development which it said, in
the 1966 report, were somewhat re-
tarded by the damaging effect of the
prolonged drought. Some development
did go on, such as the 'factory and plant
extensions, and new products, including
the McKay rotary hoe, and most
recently the aqua-ammonia, fertiliser
applicator, which should have a good
market as the supply of local ammonia
will rapidly increase in 1968.
The only recent call on shareholders
for further funds was the one-for-five
issue at 100 percent premium in April,
1965. The company likes to have cash
in hand to take advantage of oppor-
tunities as they arise, and its current
ratio is always very healthy.
Stocks increased 7 percent to
$1,452,000 in 1966-67, while debtors
rose 33 percent, indicating greater
accommodation for customers finan-
cially embarrassed by the drought. This
is an expensive way to do business; a re-
turn to better seasonal conditions will
remove the need for it.
In May, 1967, the company branched
away from the agriculturally oriented
business to the auto-parts field, acquir-
ing the S. and G. Barlow group, which
is a leading manufacturer of industrial
gear transmissions. This was after
divesting itself of the disappointing
Wheels and Rims’ joint venture in
August, 1966.
The dividend rate of 12J percent
established in 1959 was varied for one
term only with an additional 2 percent
tax free in 1964, paid wholly and
exclusively out of the company’s tax-
paid reserve account, representing
amounts in respect of which tax was:
paid by the subsidiary, Welch Perrin.
The company could easily revise this
rate up to 15 percent if earning rate
approaches 30 percent in 1968-69, as
well it might, given continuation of
present encouraging factors. The devel-
opment of new products and new mar-
kets in later years could well lead to
capital demands on shareholders.
At $1.36, the 50c shares are moving
up toward their peak for 1966 and
1967, but are well below the $2.08 and
$2.20 ceiling for 1964 and 1965, so
there should be scope for modest
advance in the share price within the
next few months as the 1968 results
become known, and directors elaborate
on prospects for the future. Next year,,
things should go really well.

That a flanged wheel turns easily on a steel rail is a simple
fact of immense importance to Australia. Were it not for
the constant turning of such a wheel in this country of
vast distances, transport costs inevitably would be much
higher. Historically, on the turning of that wheel the
whole structure of the nation’s transport charges have
come to be based.
Whether it’s passengers or freight, nothing moves traffic
over land as quickly, efficiently or economically as rail-
ways. Only a train can haul 1,000 tons of freight at a single
lift and at high, sustained speeds over vast distances,
with minimum of manpower, fuel, effort. Ton-mile for
ton-mile, trains take the high cost out of. transport.
Another thing. Australia’s railways are government-
owned, are not operated essentially for profit but to pro-
vide necessary freight and passenger services for Aus-
tralia’s people. Support for the Railways of Australia is
support for a century old, century tried and tested policy
of common-sense transport costs from which all Aus-
tralians benefit.

Security analysis
Lysaght's need to integrate
JOHN LYSAGHT’S history goes
back to a small sheet-steel mill in
Bristol, England, in 1857. In 1880 the
English company opened up a trading
agency in Melbourne and captured
most of the Australian demand for
sheet steel. It was, therefore, natural
and inevitable when BHP made its
historic decision to set up an integrated
iron and steel industry, the first BHP
steel plant opened in Newcastle in 1915,
that John Lysaght would also establish
a sheet steel mill. With the Lysaght
Newcastle plant, which commenced
production in 1921, the company
swiftly transformed itself from an im-
porting into ••■a- 1 local manufactqring
organisation. Today, the company is
the sole manufacturer of sheet steel in
Australia.
From the beginning, John Lysaght
was BHP’s biggest customer, and this
position still continues. There is no
financial link between the two com-
panies, but each is vitally dependent
on the other. Lysaght’s purchases of
BHP feed, mainly hot rolled strip,
represents possibly about one-sixth of
BfiP’s total annual crude steel output.
John Lysaght (Australia) Ltd. is a
subsidiary of Guest Keen & Nettlefolds
Ltd., London, and the U.K. interest,
which was 80.6 percent, in 1967, has
been reduced to about 76 percent with
the recent takeover of Brownbuilt Ltd.
In terms of comparative size in 1967,
John Lysaght represented 20.3 percent
of GKN’s world turnover of $759 mil-
lion, 13.2 percent of GKN’s total assets
employed, and 5.8 percent of the GKN
group employment.
In an analysis of Lysaght’s Austra-
lian market sales to main customers in
1967, the building and construction
industries absorbed nearly 30 percent;
automotive, tractor, and agricultural
machinery trades about 20 percent;
industrial equipment and domestic
electrical appliances added another 15
percent, and the balancing 35 percent
was in miscellaneous trades and ser-
vices including consumer products, steel
containers, and sales to distributors.
Possibly half of distributors’ sales might
he to the building industry. Of a total
tonnage of 876,000 tons of steel sheets
and coils in the calendar year 1967 (up
21 percent on 1966), exports repre-
sented 15.9 percent and homes sales
in Australia 84.1 percent. The normal
annual rate of growth is about six per-
cent, but 1967 was an exceptionally
good year. Galvanised sheets in which
a zinc coating is applied represented
about 51 percent of Lysaght’s tonnage
in 1967, but after taking account of
exports, a dissection of Australian
domestic sales showed that coated
sheets made up 45 percent and the
balancing 55 percent was in uncoated
sheets. Uncoated sheets are mainly used
to produce automotive, refrigerator,
stove, and washing-machine panels;
containers, furniture, and office fittings.
Import competition in sheet steel,
principally from Japan, is becoming a
significant element which the Lysaght
people have to contend with. Imports
amounted to 81,700 tons of uncoated
sheet in the calendar year 1967 this
is wholly competitive with Lysaght
products and to 15,400 tons of
coated sheet of which 3800 tons was
competitive with Lysaght sheet the
balance consisted of electrogalvanised
sheet and aluminium-coated sheet,
which is not yet made in Australia.
Imports represented about 15 per-
cent of the Australian market for un-
coated sheet prior to May, 1966, when
anti-dumping action was taken to
restrain cheap imports from Japan, and
this had the effect of increasing Japan-
ese prices by 5 to ' 1\ percent.
Imports then fell to about 12 percent,
but they have since increased again,
and in 1967 exceeded 17 percent of
the uncoated sheet market, which is a
higher figure than Lysaghts would like
to see and which involves them in
more intensified marketing.
Lysaghts have at least two aces up
their sleeve in protecting their Aus-
tralian market one is a very strong
distribution network and the other
is in a large and growing captive
business. In distribution, the company
has service and sales centres in all
Australian capital cities, as well as
Townsville, to provide a speedy and
efficient service enabling delivery
within hours and for special require-
ments within seven days. This contrasts
vividly with a market situation of less
than a decade ago, when sheet steel
was manufactured and delivered on a
“mill cycle” basis of approximately
three months. The bulk-service centres
also offer decentralised processing
facilities: for example, blanking, which
enables steel in coil form to be dis-
patched from Port Kembla works to
the service centre, where it is sheared
into the sheet length required by
individual customers.
In their captive business department,
John Lysaght and their subsidiary,
Brownbuilt, annually use about 170,000
tons of sheet steel in branded end-
processed and fabricated products. This
was equal to about 23 percent of
Lysaght’s total domestic sales tonnage
in 1967. The takeover of Brownbuilt
Ltd. at a cost of slightly less than $ll
million on a part share and cash
basis (this became effective on April 1,
1968, although the whole of the shares
had not been acquired at that date)
added about 35,000 tons of captive
sheet-steel business used in manufactur-
ing office and industrial furniture and
equipment, and in a broad range of
low-pitched metal roof-decking pro-
ducts. In the low-pitched metal-roofing
field, which is growing in demand at
the rate of about 8 to 9 percent a year,
the Lysaght/Brownbuilt combination
now have about 70 percent of the Aus-
tralian market, as well as supplying the
raw-material sheet steel to other end
manufacturers in the industry. In highl-
and medium-pitched steel roof-decking,
Lysaght’s “Custom Orb” and other
shapes of galvanised sheet continue to
enjoy about 100 percent of the market.
The Lysaght group also produces
flooring products such as structural
decking, wall products and partitions,
prefabricated rural buildings, mobile

Measured against the net profit in

one year before the public float of
April, 1961, the company has shown
fluctuating fortunes, but prospects over
the medium term beyond 1968 look
promising. In the immediate short
term, the company is not anticipating
any increase in parent-company profit
in the calendar year 1968 compared
with 1967 in view of an exceptionally
high-demand pattern last year; this
forecast is before allowing for the new
subsidiary Brownbuilt Ltd., whose re-
sults were consolidated as from April.
1968. A bullish note was the announce-
ment in March, 1968, of a joint feasibi-
lity study by BHP, John Lysaght, and
Guest Keen & Nettlefolds to determine
whether the three companies should
jointly establish a new integrated iron
and steel works in Australia. John
Lysaght is the only major producer
of sheet steel in the world which does
not have its own integrated steel-
works. We can speculate that there
is a fairly good expectation of the
three companies becoming partners in
a joint venture, hut there is no commit-
ment at this stage. Sites are being con-
sidered in Victoria, South Australia,
and Queensland, but the betting at this
stage favors either Westernport (Vic-
toria) or Port Adelaide.
At $3.60 the $1 shares have a divi-
dend yield of 3.5 percent and a price-
earnings ratio of 17.0. If we add, as
a speculative bonus element, the pos-
sible venture into basic steel making,
the current share price should prove
attractive to long-term institutional
shareholders.

Mining
Tax problems for Western Tit.
WESTERN TITANIUM shareholders
have been put through the hoops
properly since the annual report came
out last month telling of an increase
in after-tax profit from the $664,000
earned during 1966 to the $935,000
which the company made for the latest
year which ended last January. The
increase was due largely to the fact
that expenditure on the company’s
$BOO,OOO beneficiation plant Ineant
no tax was payable for the year just
past (in the previous year the com-
pany paid $165,000 in taxation), but
mine working profit also rose by
$161,000.
The company has had a tax holiday
for some years now. It has always
taken into account all available con-
cessions for capital expenditure and
for the past six years has paid no tax
except in 1966. At that time the com-
pany stated that all previous deduc-
tions for capital expenditure had been
claimed, and had it not been for the
money spent on the beneficiation plant
it would have been necessary to pro-
vide for tax out of last year’s earnings,
reducing these from $935,000 to around
$617,000.
It now appears that some of the
deductions claimed in past years may
have been in error. At the annual
meeting the company’s chairman, Mr.
J. M. Joice, told shareholders that a tax
assessment had been received in respect
of the deductions claimed by the com-
pany for expenditure on its bulk-
loading facilities, which were completed
in March, 1965, at a cost of over
$600,000. The assessment calls for pay-
ment of $535,000 of taxation, and the
company has reduced its interim
dividend by 2 cents a share in order to
conserve liquidity in the face of lower
profits this year. These lower expected
profits are due to the running-in of
the new beneficiation plant as well as
the need to provide for taxation.
The assessment, disallowing past
deductions for sums spent on the bulk-
loading installation, may have arisen
from the recent High Court decision
concerning BHP. This decision upheld
BHP’s appeal that sums spent on rail-
ways and jetties, etc., were allowable
deductions in that they were necessary
in order to give the product of the
mine its commercial significance. The
corollary to this is that where the
expenditure is not necessary to the
commercial viability of the project,
then the deductions are not available.
In Western Titanium’s case this may
well have been so, as the company
operated for several years without the
benefit of this bulk-loading installation,
and the facility is rented out to other
ilmenite producers. The BHP case
may also mean that the company’s
deductions for money spent on the
beneficiation plant will be disallowed,
as the recent judgment held that
RHP’s expenditure on its new pellet
plant was not available for deductions
as it only enhanced the value of mine
products which were already salable
in their unprocessed state.
With such problems at hand, it is
just as well that the company’s
management (and shareholders) do not
have to worry about finding markets
for their ilmenite, or be pre-occupied
with looking for additional ore reserves.
These are sufficient for at least 30
years at current rates of production,
and recent additions have not been
fully assessed. On the score of markets,
the company must face a very rosy
future; it recently entered into an
agreement to supply Laporte Titanium
(Australia) Ltd. with a, million tons
of ilmenite over the 20 years beginning
in 1971. The rate of production
implicit in this agreement means that
the company will be more than
doubling existing capacity, and at least
it can be reasonably certain that the
capital expenditure involved in such
expansion will bring on another round
of taxation concessions, at least in the
initial years.
The combination of substantial
forward orders and the reserves of
mineral to service them places the
company in a good position to take
in its stride the new tax payment of
$535,000, which is a once-only item,
and even if it gets a further bill for
tax on last year’s profits, this, too,
would be no catastrophe. Should the
company approach shareholders for
more capital (it is by no means over-
capitalised) the shares should be well
worthwhile picking up.
HAMERSLEY IRON will soon have
to get moving on its plans to set up a
plant to make metallised agglomerates
(the revolutionary new raw material for
steel that does away with blast fur-
naces) if it is to keep to a program out-
lined last week by Western Australia’s
Industrial Development Minister, Mr.
Charles Court.
On his return from 10 weeks over-
seas, Mr. Court forecast 'that Hamersley
would be exporting metallised agglom-
erates to Europe by 1972. Europe
would be taking metallised products
before Japan, he said, because its steel
mills were better placed to make the
expensive step of phasing out of current
techniques; the Japanese mills were on
a different scale and often newer, thus
Japan would start behind Europe in the
handling of metallised steel-mill feed.

THE LAND
When foot and mouth rages
AT THE SIGHT of the wild boar
of Erymanthus run to ground by Her-
cules, Eurystheus fled in terror and
hid himself in a bronze jar. Similar
panic was shown recently when the
Australian quarantine authorities said
that some Warkworth (N.Z.) swine
were foot and mouth suspects. They
put up the shutters on imports of
meat from the shaky isles as firmly
as did the British against Argentine
meat last year, on a suspicion that their
scourge of foot and mouth had its
origins in that South American republic.
All is clear with the Warkworth
pigs now: they have been given a
clean bill of health and Australia-
New Zealand trade and pastoral rela-
tions are back to normal in good time
for the earliest of the Cup charts. But
the incident still leaves a dirty taste
in the mouth, not so much because
the New Zealand authorities were
vexed at our precipitate action but
more because it revealed a sad state
of Australian ignorance on the disease
itself. But, at any rate, it showed once
again how speedy our quarantine
authorities are in taking action when
there’s only the slightest risk of foreign
disease being brought to our animal
population.
We’ve never had foot and mouth in
Australia and God forbid that we
should get if. But it’s rather overdoing
it to say, as some have recently, that
it would wreck our pastoral industry,
which currently produces about
900,000 tons of meat (well over half
being beef and veal) a year and which
last year provided $278 million exports
of meat alone.
It should be realised that, although
foot and mouth is a terrible disease
(all animals can get and carry the
infection and humans also can carry
the virus, but, we won’t go into its
symptoms, effects, and cures this week)
and has taken an appalling toll among
Argentine cattle herds (at present
about 52 million or nearly three times
as' big as ours) and, indeed, among
those of the numerous European,
Asian, African, and Soviet herds it
continues to hit, it has become a
manageable disease. It can be isolated
and confined to small affected areas,
as is done in Argentina, where although
more than 5000 outbreaks were re-
ported last year the industry con-
tinued to flourish physically even if
not economically.
As in Argentina, the main disaster
factor in foot and mouth here would
be not so much the toll it might take
on our animal population (bad enough
that would be) but the implicit
danger for our growing meat export
trade. Information from Argentina
suggests that the disease has struck in
conditions not unlike those which we
might find if we got it in Australia.
Foot and mouth is a vile and
agonising disease, although Argentinian
farmers would argue that they know
many a deadlier, as indeed they do. In
a country where the sun is bright and
the air dry, where there is never more
than one beast to every two to three
acres (and frequently as few as one
to every 50), and where cattle live all
their lives out of doors, the foot-and-
mouth virus never gains such a hold
as it does in the damper European
climate. The dark, steamy warmth
of a cowshed is its ideal breeding
ground: The result is that when an
Argentine cow gets foot and mouth,
it is generally much less sick and re-
covers more quickly than its European
counterpart. Thus, there is a funda-
mental misunderstanding between
Britain and Argentina about just how
serious an outbreak of foot and mouth
is, and it explains why Argentina is so
deeply resentful of British reactions.
For reasons nobody quite under-
stands, except that it has a climate
similar to Canada, the disease is
hardly ever found in the southern part
of Argentina and isn’t found in
Canada either. When an outbreak does
occur, it is dealt with by a slaughter
policy. But in the rest of the country
the disease is endemic, carried not only
by cattle but by deer, rabbits, and
llama crossing the border from neigh-
boring countries where precautions are
almost nil and generally making the
idea of ever completely clearing
Argentina of the virus a pipedream.
Just the same, Argentine farmers
worry about it. Their cattle may not
be mortally ill when they contract foot
and mouth, but it does set back growth
by several weeks and that is serious
enough in itself. The Government be-
gan to introduce compulsory vaccina-
tion in 1960, extending it gradually
until the whole country is now in the
scheme with the exception of the
disease-free zone in the south.
Agrisearch
Attempts to tame the wild oat
WAY BACK in 200 B.C. the Roman
dramatist Plautus remarked that “a
proper place for men to sow their wild
oats is where they will not spring up.”
From such ethnic wisdom and biblical
references we can be sure that the wild
oat has been a serious agricultural weed
since ancient times. It has pursued
civilisation down the centuries to the
four corners of the earth and in our day
is still indubitably the world’s worst
weed of cereal crops. Its destructiveness
in Australia is not well documented, but
many of our cereal scientists are
inclined to believe that it causes greater
losses in wheat than skeleton weed,
which is more notorious.
Even light infestations reduce yields
significantly. As a rule of thumb, one
wild oat plant per square foot cuts the
harvest by about two bushels per acre.
Agronomists of the Western Australian
Department of Agriculture have
recorded shocking losses in more heavily
infested crops. In a trial at Wongan
Hills, for instance, an oat-free plot
of wheat out-yielded an infested plot
by more than threefold 22.3 bushels
as compared with 6.7 bushels. Reduc-
tions 'by half have been frequently
recorded. To these losses must be added
the dockage of eight cents a- bushel
received for wheat containing an intol-
erable percentage of wild-oat seeds. Last
year in Western Australia some 2J mil-
lion bushels were discounted at the silos,
This would represent a cash loss of
about $200,000 to the State’s wheat-
growers besides contributing to the difi-
ficulty of selling the national wheat
crop. *
It is no wonder that departments
0 f agriculture have resorted to intra-
state and interstate conferences lately
to discuss all known and prospective
means of controlling wild oat. Indeed,
the problem is so serious, so intractable,
and so widespread that the CSIRO
could consider joining the battle with its
armory of fundamental research wea-
pons. Its chance of winning further
laurels is too good to pass up. No one
seems to be really tackling this weed
problem right now and the field is
pretty clear of competitors. At the
Imoment the mood of the U.S. Depart-
ment of Agriculture seems to be ‘‘lf
you can’t beat ’em join ’em.” The

gleam in its cereal geneticists’ eyes is to
breed from v/ild oats a variety of tame
oats that will outstrip all other grains
in per-acre production of protein. Even
if this venture turns out to be success-
ful, wild oat will, of course, still
remain a weed problem.
The Americans have dropped on to
the surprising fact that wild oat has
a protein content as high as 30 per-
cent compared with only about 18 per-
cent in our cultivated varieties. It
is, furthermore, a better-quality pro-
tein than that provided by any other
cereal currently being cultivated. Wild
oat also has a very high seeding
capacity and is unaffected by a wide
range of cereal diseases such as the
rusts, smuts, and mildews. These are
the very characteristics which contribute
to its nastiness as a weed, but, as a
cultivated plant, would become great
virtues, resulting in huge and reliable
harvests. The scientists think that
yields of 150 bushels per acre are quite
possible. After allowing for some loss
of quantity and quality in a cross-
breeding program, a new oat based on
wild oat could nevertheless become
the world’s most productive and
nutritious cereal.
Eight to ten years of breeding and
testing must intervene before any such
revolutionary variety of oat can be
developed and seed made available for
commercial farming. However, we
can feel fairly confident that the
breeding program will proceed with-
out striking many serious hitches. Wild-
oat species cross readily with cultivated
types and their shattering habit can
also be bred out.
For the present, wild-oat suppression
rests largely on a few selective herbi-
cides, among which “Avadex BW” and
“Carbyne” are most widely used.
Neither is entirely satisfactory. They
are economically advantageous only
when applied to crops that will be, or
are, heavily infested. In the one case
the farmer has to guess; in the other,
considerable damage to the crop has
already been sustained. The cost of
treatment is of the order of $5 an
acre and, according to Western Aus-
tralian trials, complete suppression of
the weed is never obtained. Moreover,
these chemicals are only marginally
selective. Some strains of wheat and
barley are more or less susceptible and
most can be damaged by uneven or
excessive spraying. Hence, directions
concerning dosage must be accurately
interpreted and rigidly followed.
By developing resistant strains of
wheat and barley, cereal breeders could
enhance the usefulness of both these
chemicals. Agronomists could define
more clearly the conditions under
which spraying will produce optimum
results and describe more fully how
the farmer can promote vigorous
growth of the crop because strong
competition can effectively control wild
oat.


ARTS AND ENTERTAINMENT
Critics’ seminar
Where one false word
meant intellectual ruin
By SANDRA HALL
PREDICTABLY, literature and the
visual arts were the grande dames of
the UNESCO seminar on criticism in
the arts last week. After all, the
international stars, A 1 Alvarez and
Clement Greenberg were theirs, and
they, along with their musical col-
leagues, were easily tops in the busi-
ness of summoning up the biggest and
best abstractions in the verbal
athletics contests staged in the Univer-
sity of Sydney’s Merewether Building.
Perhaps it was a feeling for the
underdog, or less nobly and more
honestly, a weariness of the brain,
which kept leading me back to the
group discussions on those twin Cin-
derellas of the arts film and tele-
vision. For, after the morning plenary
sessions were done, one had to declare
one’s coloi's by choosing one’s art for
the afternoon, since five group discus-
sions ran simultaneously each day.
|And there seemed to be few
line-crossers, with the notable excep-
tion of the seminar’s chief organiser,
Professor Alan Stout, who, to his eternal
credit, had something lucid and rea-
sonable to contribute on everything.
Despite the constantly la'mented lack
of an Australian film industry, the film
men are beginning to develop their con-
flicts, prejudices, and rival schools.
Pessimism, however, seems to be the
overriding emotion among the television
critics. As someone said gloo’mily:
“Among all the groups here today, this
Is the only one unable to discuss the
finer points of its craft. We’re still
concerned with fundamentals.”
Admitting to a certain defensiveness,
the television men maintained that the
responsibilities of the television critic
were tougher than “talking about F. R.
Leavis ad nauseam ” and resented the
fact that “academics view TV as a
lost cause.” Things would improve
only with the creation of a Chair in
Electronic Media at one of the univer-
sities, or when the 'medium began to
be its own critic.
It was a pity that W. H. Perkins,
author of a paper titled “The Qualifi-
cations and Responsibilities of the Film
and Television Critic,” w<js not there
to defend himself. A Tasmanian
academic with an interest in film pro-
grams for children, he was prevented
by illness from attending the seminar,
and his paper was read by Professor
Stout.
As implied by the title, the subject
was a contentious one, and Mr. Perkins’
rather dull but undoubtedly high-
'minded list of critical qualifications
quickly raised the ire of film men with
a more progressive attitude to the art.
The paper was “full of conventional
wisdom,” said “The Australian’s”
Michael Thornhill, forgetting very
quickly that his was supposed to be
the moderate role of chairman, “full
of words like ‘purposeful,’ ‘good,’ and
‘uplifting,’ and talk of the critic as a
leader, when in the final result, every-
thing gets down to taste and opinion.”
Now, of course, he was on even 'more
contentious ground, for film critics,
more than the critics of most other
arts, are sharply divided about methods
of judgment.
Thornhill and other critics who have
worked with film see it rightly as a
unique medium to be judged by
unique criteria. “For instance, I think
‘The Rifleman’ is a tnore exciting pro-
gram than ‘The Power Game,’ because
it has more to say in term of myths,
legends, and fantasies,” he says. Critics
such as he resent strongly the status
value attached to Continental films and
the art cinema, and champion the pro-
fessionalis'm of some Hollywood films
dismissed by other critics with the
odious label, “commercial.”
It’s a valid and ultimately correct
point of view. But listening to it, one
begins to feel vaguely uneasy as if
these men, by imposing their tyranny
of technique, are raising more esoteric
gods than the ones they tear down.
Like their television counterparts,
the drama critics were discussing the
question of university courses for
critics. Professor Robert Quentin of
NIDA thought not, saying the critic
was a “professional spectator whose
mind ought not to be contaminated
with theatrical know-how.” Professor
Stout, however, thought the seminar
should suggest to the Churchill Fellow-
ship that it consider a critic as a
recipient of its award.
John Sumner, manager of the Mel-
bourne Theatre Company, had some
interesting things to say about the
box-office value of reviews. “Brave
reviews,” he said, “were invariably bad
Professor Bernard Smith,
convener of the critics’ seminar
for business, while the only reviews
which increased box-office sales were
the brief and straightforwardly favor-
able ones on the day following the
play’s opening.
“If people have one good reason for
not going to a play, they’ll embrace it.
If you get bad reviews, you’ll do no
business, but ‘good’ reviews aren’t
always good reviews from a manage-
ment point of view.”
All these group discussions were
informal and intimate occasions for
airing pet opinions, but -the arena of
the plenary sessions was a different
matter. One had to be fitted with
stout academic armor before issuing a
challenge there.
One young man told Greenberg
that one of his assertions would “make
Leavis turn in his grave,” only to be
told, in return, that Leavis wasn’t yet
in his grave. He recovered to fight
again, but an older man mightn’t have.
There was time for approved intel-
lectual jokery, too. On the first day,
the chairman’s request that people
preface their questions with their
names produced a short minor contest
in witty introductions. Wittingly or
unwittingly (we still don’t know),
Professor Bernard Smith of the Power
Institute of Fine Arts set the ball roll-
ing by announcing himself with
excessive simplicity as “Smith.” A man
called Jones followed, then Arthur
Phillips, alias “Phillips, Melbourne
refugee,” and finally, Max Harris
“Harris of Salt Lake City.” This last
was apparently in retaliation to
Alvarez, who had earlier compared
Adelaide to Salt. Lake City.
It was all lively, stimulating, and
yes, entertaining, but a week of it
brought its own inevitable conclusion
I wouldn’t want to live there.


Art
Avant-garde
needs revolution
By ELWYN LYNN
William Rose. Bonython Gallery, Syd-
ney.
Richard Walter Sickert. David Jones’,
Sydney.
Students of 1968. Blaxland Gallery,
Sydney.
NATURALLY, with Clement Green-
berg in the country and this week
advising on the judging of the George’s
Prize in Melbourne, two spectres that
have been haunting modern painting
have become more substantial. One is
the notion that all the masters, past
and present, are intent upon the pre-
servation of the picture plane and the
subjugation of illusory features; the
other, not so readily acceptable, is the
implication that when an avant-garde
movement declines and, like abstract
expressionism, is propped up by its
supporters until it becomes a new
academy, the individual artist declines
with it. Mr. Greenberg doesn’t quite
say this, for artists do go on creating
in a style that is no longer avant-
garde and without becoming academic
avant-garde, but in the modern period
these are indeed rare and seem uninter-
esting as the focus of inspiration shifts
elsewhere. It’s a theory that perturbs the
recent avant-garde that feels it has
been condemned by the “logic” of
history.
Such a theory may well be dis-
turbing because Hegelian cycle
theories tend to simulate purist Marx-
ism: there is hardly any tolerance of
the co-existence of varied art styles,
and, for example, realism is considered
exhausted and flat area abstraction is
in fine fettle. Theoretical objections
to such notions, are obvious, but simple
observation bears Greenberg out. The
loose, broken surface of abstract expres-
sionism is exhausted and the cycle has
moved to rigorous structure as it did
with Cubism after Fauvism. You may
consider that the variegated simultaneity
of the scene invalidates his theory, but
he argues that all the new art shares
a common style of cool hues, unbroken
contours, and uninflected surfaces.
The real difficulty is that while
people may agree on the decline of a
movement, they feel that individual
painters survive, and here Mr. Green-
berg has to resort to personal experi-
ence and not historical cycles; for
example, he thinks that de Kooning,
usually regarded as the Great Survivor
of abstract-expressionism, was ex-
hausted by 1950, yet Thomas Hess has
just edited two books on de Kooning’s
latest drawings and paintings. This,
Mr. Greenberg might say, is simply
the academy that has grown up
around “Art News” that put all its
money on abstract-expressionism and is
now flogging a dead horse; and to
account for this he has a theory of
how the avant-garde grows academic
and how something like Trotsky’s per-
manent revolution is required, for the
avant-garde has no salon (as in 19th-
century France) or official line (as in
Russia) to rebel against. As he asked
in Sydney on May 17, where is the
revolution when everyone is a revo-
lutionary?
How does William Rose stand up to
the modernist ideology? Once he
organised his bland surfaces with tight,
repeated grids of right-angled lines.
These grids, sometimes clustering,
sometimes floating freely, held the sur-
face together with admirable ease and
finality, but under the influence of
abstract-expressionism and the con-
nected sequences of Futurism, he is
floating his whirling shapes and
twitching forms, like birds, a jazz
trumpeter (15), smashed pianos (21),
heavy traffic (20), and an orchestra
(7) in a void as though they were
painted mobiles.
What of the survival value of Sic-
kert? He died in 1942 and here the
latest paintings are the two portraits
of Cicely Hay, both done about
1922-23; though he lightened his
palette slightly in the ’twenties, he
remained a muted, dark painter of
soft nuances when the world was
blazing with imitations of Van Gogh,
with the Fauvists, and with the Expres-
sionists, and when Cubists were tighten-
ing up surface structure. If he glanced
at Gauguin, he gazed at Goya Velas-
quez and Hals. His Portrait of a
Man With Drooping Moustache
(c. 1895) is dark Manet and Velas-
quez and Goya shadowed the
ghostly faces in the weird theatre
interior at the Adelaide Festival, but
his portrait of Cicely Hay connects
him with modernism: the face is
slightly neurotic with Goyaesque
anxieties, but the placing of the tense
hands on the end of the bed and the
gold vertical on the wallpaper on the
left are object lessons in frontality and
preservation of the picture plane. He
is a minor painter and a splendid
one, and it would be hard to prove
that he would have been better had he
looked beyond Degas and the Camden
Town Group.
The exhibition by students of Syd-
ney High Schools and Technical
Colleges is surprisingly refreshing and
winners deserve their Vynol prizes;
it’s surprising because we have heard
so much about the inadequacies of
the colleges and their products and,
surprise on surprise, Mr. Greenberg
thinks that the high level of com-
petence in Australian painting indicates
that our schools are better than those
of America! Names to note are
S. Bryant, A. Kelly, M. Overhue, K.
Latta, C. Husband, J. McFarlane,
J. Page, and J). Hill. Almost all the
exhibitors are children of the present
revolution, but they should not com-
mit themselves too soon, for revolution
is so permanent.
Television
Sargent's pride
By DENIS O'BRIEN
STEFAN SARGENT’S first film for
Australian television rasped into view
about three years ago as an almost
passionate defence of the Australian
Londoners the expatriates who can’t
stop telling us how much better they’re
doing in England and how stupid we
were to neglect their talents while they
were among us. The film had vitality
and impactful purpose; it also marked
Mr. Sargent, who had himself just re-
turned from England, as a Young Man
To Be Watched.
Sargent-watchers haven’t since had
many opportunities to study their man’s
progress. The occasional pieces he has
contributed to television mostly for
Project have always had an abrasive
edge but haven’t stopped the heart or
arrested the mind. Late last year, when
he growled his frustrations into my ear
at a party, he’d begun to sound like one
of his own Australian Londoners
“neglect ... no opportunities . . . tight-
fisted managements ... no freedom.”
His professional pride at that time was
being sustained by a film he’d shot in
the Longreach area. Last week, ABC-
TV brought it to the screen as a touch-
ing, soft-edged, hard-centred documen-
tary called “Edge of the Outback.”
Welcome back, Stefan Sargent!
Taking Central Queensland’s three-
year drought as his theme, Sargent
studied it through its effect on a grazier
and his family. Naturally the view was
selfish. Anyone who looked for an im-
partial summary of drought in a sort
of microcosm of rural Australia
wouldn’t have found it. And I imagine
there were many city slickers disin-
clined to feel the pangs of the grazier’s
relucant decision to sell 2000 grass-
starved sheep when he still had a light
plane parked by the front gate of his
homestead.
Too many people looking at represen-
tations of our cherished outback demand
an all-purpose picture for fear that a
section of it might misrepresent the
whole of the world at large. Well,
there’s a color print of this film on
offer to overseas buyers, and anyone
buying it will get a perceptive view of
a slice of Australia in which the satiric
undertones make the entire production
almost brutally honest.
By the end, Stefan Sargent seems
more concerned with style than sub-
ject (there are too many “pretty” pic-
tures) but he has made a film which
marks him as a Young Man Worth
Watching.


Life on a slippery pole
DAVID BAKER...”I lurched from one ghastly situation to another”
By PHILLIP ADAMS
“MY FUTURE is desolate,” says David
Baker matter-of-factly. “I get up in the
morning and wonder what the hell I
can do today. What can I think about?
Who can I phone? Or write to? It just
drives you mad.”
Baker has directed 1150 live television
programs and 60 filmed programs,
many of which have been screened in
Sweden, Canada, the U.K., Germany,
Southern Rhodesia, and Japan. He
worked on Ealing Studio’s final feature
and produced Australia’s first attempt
at good children’s television. He can
claim a major role in the discovery of
the Beatles, and was the first to put
Barry Humphries on camera. Yet he
finds himself out of work more often
than not, having been employed about
two years in the past five.
He was born in Tasmania about 40
years ago, and even close friends will
be surprised to learn that his father is
no less a personage than the Hon. Sir
Henry Baker, K.C.M.G., D. 5.0., LL.M.,
M.L.C., who presided over the notorious
Orr-Kemp Inquiry in 1956, later becom-
ing Chancellor of the University of
Tasmania.
After completing a Science course in
1952, Baker went to London with an
unfocused ambition to work in films,
but found himself hawking Good House-
keeping cookery books. While on the
hunt for hapless housewives he passed
an open stage door and, hearing a
rehearsal in progress, wandered in. Mis-
taken for somebody else, he was hired
as an assistant stage manager.
Encouraged by the ease with which
he’d entered theatre, he decided to
tackle the feature-film industry, only to
find that “you couldn’t get a job with-
out a ticket, and you couldn’t get a
ticket without a job.” However, that
summer, while most of the crews were
holidaying, Baker persuaded the late
Anthony Asquith to give him a chance
in a crew working on a B feature called
“The Stolen Airliner.” “It was directed
by an Australian called Don Sharpe,
shot on Lord Someone’s estate, where
the rain peed down for weeks. I was
the lowest of the low—a clapper-loader.
I’d bang the clapper-board before a
take, and swop over camera magazines.
And the caste-system among technicians
was so ossified that I had to stand at
attention beside the camera all day.”
A few industrial documentaries later,
Baker found himself filming news
material at the Le Mans car races. He
remembers Mike Hawthorn turning into
the pits and precipitating the worst
accident in the race’s history. “I heard
a noise like a giant going whoomph
with a rug. It was a car disintegrating
as it tore into the crowd. About 85
people were killed. I can remember the
piles of shoes and handbags.”
After some months as general dogs-
body to Disney’s London organisation,
Baker managed to ship aboard
Huston’s Moby Dick, spending icy
weeks in water tanks at Elstree man-
handling mechanical whales. (“The
money was crook, but you got a bottle
of rum a day.”)
Well experienced in most aspects of
production by his late twenties, Dave
was employed as assistant cameraman
in Jack Clayton’s first film and per-
haps the first British attempt at an Art
film with a capital A. This was Wolf
Mankowitz’s memorable adaptation of
Gogol’s “The Bespoke Overcoat.”
At this time, commercial television
was being introduced in Britain, and
the film industry was at the end of its
tether. “The morale, atmosphere, and
conditions were rock-bottom. Worse
than the Victorian Railways.” The only
hope seemed to be to get into tele-
vision oneself. “It was funny,” he
recalls with a mixture of amusement
and bitterness. “We all believed fiercely
in TV. We were quite idealistic about
it.” But again he faced a closed shop
and knockbacks.
Trying to charm Granada’s Harry
Watt, Baker mailed him a script about
a would-be producer trying to charm
Harry Watt. The ploy worked and in
quick succession Baker was a floor-
manager, writer, and producer on
current-affairs documentaries, an after-
noon magazine program, and a situa-
tion comedy.
Filled with crusading zeal, Baker
returned to Australia when we were
still staring rapturously at our test
patterns, and persuaded HSV7, in
Melbourne, to let him produce a daily
children’s program. It was there I re-
member first seeing him, lumbering
noisily around a jampacked little
studio in a sloppy jumper and black
army boots. He looked for all the
world like Li’l Abner, and certainly
HSV7’s facilities were as hillbilly as
any Dogpatch. Yet, by bullying,
cajoling, and irresistible enthusiasm, he
managed to produce 733 hour-long
programs. These contained over 350
original children’s dramas, musical
comedies, and ballets.
It was in “Young Seven” that Barry
Humphries made his TV debut when
Baker persuaded him to perform
extracts from his Bunyip pantomime.
“I can still recall the surreality
of Humphries getting off a St. Kilda
Road tram covered in mud, twigs, and
gumleaves, and dragging his swollen
bunyip tail.” For one reason or an-
other, “Young Seven” was always in
trouble with the Control Board, who-
devoted half a page in their 1961
report condemning it. “They said it
was too rich, too emotional, too vivid,’*
says Baker, “and the beat-up, bigoted,
gutless, suburbanites at the station
wouldn’t fight them.” So one of the
most extraordinary programs in our
television history was scrapped, and on
the last day Baker distributed the
following memo throughout HSV7:
“Today is my 733rd and final ‘Young
Seven.’ I would like to take this oppor-
tunity of bitterly cursing all those who
allowed the show to go on year after
year with no money, no rehearsal, no
facilities, no understanding, no sym-
pathy, no bloody nothing.”
He recalls with indignation that he
was paid the princely sum of £24 for
writing, producing, and directing those
five shows a week. However, the final
humiliation came when he was replaced
by one Happy Hammond, whose idea
of children’s television was to dress
up in a loud check sportscoat and
hand out packets of Cheese Twisties.
At this time, Pacific Film’s Roger
Mirams was doggedly proceeding with
his “Terrible Ten” series. “That was
a brave little venture, which had a
quality of freshness and freedom.
It really expressed something of our
unique Australian childhood. Some-
thing almost Lawsonian. I directed
a number of episodes, and Pacific
managed to sell the show all over the
world.” Subsequently Baker directed
a second batch of 20 episodes, but
Pacific was to lose a lot of its momen-
tum and money in attempting to


launch a series called “The Coast-
watchers.” The pilot was filmed in
New Guinea, and, to the annoyance of
the gardeners, in the tropical section
of Melbourne’s Botanical Gardens.
However, its only sale was as a half-
finished “oncer.”
Reluctantly accepting an invitation
to return to Granada, Baker produced
a series of 320 daytime programs
viewed by 4<j million viewers each day.
“I had a $500,000 budget, four direc-
tors, seven researchers, two production
people and 12 assistants. The show
combined interviews, discussions, and
satire, and in some ways was a fore-
runner to “That Was the Week.”
The Beatles made their first five tele-
vision appearances in the program after
Dave had auditioned them in a Liver-
pool cafe. “I’d seen them years be-
fore, but then I bumped into this fur-
niture salesman called Epstein, who
asked me to give them a break.” Still
convinced that there was a place for
originality in Australian live-program-
ming, a homesick Baker brought his
family back in 1963. Once again
Mirams gave him work directing filmed
series for Pacific—“ The Magic Boom-
erang” and “Seaspray.” However,
Dave yearned to produce public-affairs
programs with satirical content and put
up countless formats to ad agencies,
sponsors, and station managements,
none of which was seriously con-
sidered. “I lurched from one ghastly
situation to another,” he says. “I lost
a year trying to raise ’money for Tim
Burstall’s proposed feature on Ned
Kelly, and for many months the only
work I could get was grinding out Ex-
port Action segments for Crawfords.”
Recently, Baker was led to believe
that NET, America’s education net-
work, was interested in serious program
material, in color, from Australia and
S.-E. Asia. So Baker took a small crew
to Japan and wrote, directed, and nar-
rated a film on the sociology of Toyota
City. It explored the lack of a con-
cept of originality in the Japanese
character with real insight, but the NET
arrangements had been misinterpreted
by Baker’s producer. As a result the
only screening the film has had was on
ATN’s “Seven Days” and there seems
little likelihood of it being shown else-
where in Australia. A color fantasy on
Rest and Recreation in Sydney (com-
plete with nude-bathing sequence) is
also going begging, although Baker did
sell a short vignette on Hong Kong
feature-film production to the ABC.
Baker, who firmly believes that work-
ing in Australian cinema induces
lunacy, has always been something of
a manic-depressive. But recent years
have seen fewer ups and steeper downs,
and he lacks the flair for self-promotion
which seems necessary for success in
the electronic media. Men with Baker’s
energy and enthusiastn are rare, and
so are managements with the courage
to employ them.

STRETCHING $500
AT THE Adelaide Arts Festival, Harry
M. Miller was heard to say that the
subsidies pumped into the Victorian
Opera Company and similar organisa-
tions would be better invested with the
Trust. Nobody knows what the Trust’s
subsidy will be this year, but the Vic-
torian Opera Company is managing to
produce five full-length operas, com-
plete with costumes, scenery, principals,
chorus, and orchestra, on a subsidy of
$500 from the Victorian Government.
Britten’s “Albert Herring,” Weber’s
“Der Freischuetz” and Mozart’s “Ser-
aglio” already have been produced;
Verdi’s “Nabucco” and Rossini’s “La
Cenerentola” will follow. They are
putting on eight performances of Brit-
ten’s miniature “The Little Sweep” in
September.
EAST-WEST INDUSTRY
DESPITE THE improbability of the
project, and the mass media mirth
which swamped its launching, the Toei
Films production of “The Drifting
Avenger,” an Eastern-Western, has been
shot with impressive speed in the pad-
docks around Tamworth. The unit re-
turned to Tokyo last week, taking nine
Australian actors for the filming of
interiors which will complete the shoot-
ing schedule. The unit’s month on
location has given Tamworth a proprie-
torial interest in the film and the local
Chamber of Commerce has invited the
Toei Motion Picture Company to hold
the film’s world premiere there.
Japan rarely does things in that
Hollywood way, but we are likely to
see the Japanese back in Australia to
make more films. Mr. J. Sato, who
directed “The Drifting Avenger,” is
keen to return to film the story about
the Japanese prisoners of war who
engineered the mass escape from the
Cowra prison camp during World War
II. First, though, he has another assign-
ment: he’s due soon in Hawaii to re-
-create the Japanese attack on Pearl
Harbor for a film called “Tiger, Tiger,
Tiger.” Eventually the Japanese movie
industry might prove that Japan didn’t
lose the West or the war.
INSTANT OPINION
EXTERNAL AFFAIRS Minister Paul
Hasluck is well known for his dislike
of the Pjress and he was evidently par-
ticularly annoyed by their comments on
the recent ECAFE conference. Anyway,
it provoked him into one of his more
witty rejoinders when he spoke at an
international conference of marketing
specialists last week:
“Some public commentators could
not understand what the conference was
doing. I sometimes wonder whether
they are not the products of their own
environment. Their environment is an
office and the recurrent miracle of their
daily lives is the making of instant
coffee. Hence they get an ‘instant cof-
fee’ outlook — dip a spoon in the tin,
get some hot water, and have coffee to
drink while you write your next power-
ful condemnation of mankind. They
forget that before the powder was put
in the tin, land had to be cleared,
coffee had been grown, harvested, and
sold, and many complex problems of
commercial exchange had been over-
come, or at least sufficiently overcome,
to enable merchants to buy the coffee.
“Metaphorically, you are in com-
merce and industry and we who are in
government grapple with the tasks of
growing coffee and marketing it
economically. The instant coffee pundits
perform the daily miracle of dipping a
spoon in a tin, and they look for instant
results, instant disposal of world sur-
pluses, instant satisfaction of the world’s
needs, instant agreement between
nations about what should be done, and
the instant appearance of the result.
The way to world peace and pros-
perity is more laborious than that, as
you gentlemen well know.”
Mr. Hasluck, we understand, is an
old tea-drinker.
AFTER GALSWORTHY
SUDDENLY IT’S Chaucer, and
“Canterbury Tales” are coming up for
grabs. The revival began with a musical
version which opened recently in Lon-
don. Now, BBC-TV has announced a
$100,000 budget for a series of seven
50-minute sequences to follow the
pilgrims all the way through “Can-
terbury Tales,” and Metro-Goldwyn-
Mayer are about to film the tales for
exhibition next year.
For the BBC, the subject has its
problems. It is no longer possible to
film the pilgrims on the actual route.
“The A2 and the M2 now go slap
down the middle of the journey,” says
a BBC spokesman.

Music
Discoveries
By KENNETH ROBINS
THE SEEMING paradox of nation-
alism in music almost guaranteeing
universal popularity is well known.
Smetana and De Falla, Rimsky
Korsakov and Grieg have a folky
element which makes all the world
kin, the Western world that is. Nikhil
Banerjee’s totally absorbing sitar re-
cital in a crowded Sydney Conserva-
torium proved conclusively, however,
that the high art of any country, East
or West, has universal significance, and
this would appear to qualify or even
demolish Kipling.
I went along disturbed at the pros-
pect of hearing a two-dimensional art
somewhat emasculated by having a
large part of one of its dimensions
removed; but when Mr. Banerjee was
followed on to the platform by the
errant tabla player Mahapurush Misra
the relief in the auditorium was
obvious. We are pretty conscious of
symbols these days, and no one could
miss the timeless, unchanging, im-
mutability personified by the beauti-
ful Mrs. Banerjee on tamboura, al-
though at times a slow smile of ap-
proval greeted a burst of high in-
spiration from her husband or his
colleague.
How this great art could have ever
been regarded as an escape from reality
to a metaphysical cloud cuckoo land
•eludes me. In front of the calm, still
figure with the tamboura the other
two players exploded into a startling
display of electrifying vitality. Even
in the raga, which formed the first
part of the program, with its serious
and profound implications, there was
no trace of the trance state. What we
heard and saw were two superb
virtuosos totally involved in music-
making and overtly and unselfcon-
sciously enjoying it. Nobody plays
like this in a trance any more than a
person drives a car at 180 miles an
hour in a trance, not for long, anyway.
The cult of the plucked strings
being at its height, predictably the
kids turned out in force with a
wonderful display of outrageous and
fascinating costumes, hairdo’s, and
don’ts. A proportion of them were
hearing great instrumentalists for the
first time and the impact on some
was in the nature of a revelation. The
bass guitarist of the group behind
me had enlivened the pre-concert wait
with remarks like, “Eh, Bill, what’s the
tonic?” prompted by his study of the
program notes. This young man was
reduced to the state of stout Cortez
on a peak in Darien by the end of
the evening.
The second concert in the Youth
series also afforded plenty of extra-
musical diversion. With two of the
most popular pieces Beethoven ever
wrote on the program and an audience
where familiarity was yet to breed
any trace of contempt, the conditions
were ideal for a successful night’s
music-making. Tamas Ungar was the
young soloist in the “Emperor” Con-
certo and he played with convicition
and accuracy. There was not over-much
charm about the performance and the
liaison between the soloist and the con-
ductor was far from perfect. But there
was plenty of healthy extroversion from
Mr. Ungar, and the audience showed
their delight in the proceedings by res-
ponding with a correspondingly extro-
verted ovation.
The Fifth Symphony, still in C
minor, as Neville Cardus once said,
completed the program. Cardus was
later to regard this quip, admittedly
almost irresistible, as unworthy, for he
remembered the impact the Fifth made
on him in his youth. There can have
been few members of the audience who
were hearing this symphony for the first
time, but, if they were, Moshe Atzmon’s
reading should have been a worthwhile
introduction. All the outlines were there,
and when the ends of passages have
received the care and polish which was
obvious in their beginnings our
orchestra should be well on its way to
rehabilitation.
Films
What's new
downstairs?
By BEVERLEY TIVEY
THE TERM “underground movies,”
coined by an American writer, has been
enthusiastically adopted —by other
journalists from motives of conveni-
ence, and possibly by the makers and
distributors of these experimental
works for its raffish overtones. “Under-
ground” the mind immediately con-
jures up visions of films too daring to
be shown openly or of revolutionary
fanatics plotting in cellars.
Well, maybe Andy Warhol fits into
the first category, but none of the films
shown at a Sydney program of under-
ground films seemed to merit such
a dashing label, lively and interesting
as some of them were. Certainly there
were some pictures of naked women
(but you seem to see them everywhere
these days), and Steve Dwoskin’s
“Alone”’ depicted a girl writhing
erotically; but however stimulating this
may have been to the young woman,
to a spectator it soon became absurd
and dull.
But assuming that “underground'*
really signifies “experimental,” how did
the program rate? In the first place,
it was far too long: it’s unfair both
to the films themselves and to an
audience \to present such a lengthy
selection of 'movies, which, by definition,
demand alert\and concentrated atten-
tion. The more, valuable especially
Three in the “underground”... a
scene from Paul Cox's “Matuta”
those shown toward the end of the
evening, when the most dedicated
student’s mind is beginning to wander
tend to be swamped among the
merely foolish or showy items.
A spokesman for the distributors,
ÜBU Films, has described under-
ground movies as being made by people
uninterested in story or content,
merely concerned with the structure of
films. This should, itself, have ruled
out a good proportion of the movies
shown. Even the work of Bruce Con-
nor doesn’t entirely fit the description:
a brilliant editor who makes films as
a collage of newsreel shots, stills, and
old movies, he still has a basic concern
with subject matter. The Australian
“Hearts And Minds,” made by Bruce
Petty and Phillip Adams, blends film
of Vietnam with Petty’s drawings, but
its impact comes from its theme and
its sincerity rather than from this
effective, but hardly novel, technique.
In fact, the only definition of
“underground” that seems to cover all
these offerings is that they’re movies
that haven’t yet got a commercial
release. Some of them are too dull
and silly to deserve one; others could
be shown successfully at any commer-
cial cinema. You don’t need to be
a dedicated cineaste to appreciate the
wit and fun of Ben Hayeem’s
“Flora,” or to be beguiled by Vernon
Sundfors’ agreeable cartoons.
Since films began, people have been
experimenting with new techniques,
which, if successful, have been absorbed
into the main stream of movie-making,
after initially being thought too wild
and way-out for consideration. D. W.
Griffith was almost laughed off the
screen when he first used the
close-up, now part of the alphabet of
cinema. And what commercial audi-
ence, even ten years ago, would have
accepted the editing of “Blow-Up,”
“The Knack,” or “The Pawnbroker”?
I’m all for experimenters, especially
if they have such definite, though
undisciplined, talent as Bruce Connor.
What is tiresome is the assumption of
the current lot that they invented the
whole thing. People have, thank
goodness, been experimenting with
artistic techniques since the first cave-
man made the mental connection
between a rock wall and a burnt stick.


BOOKS
How one philosopher sees
the human mind
By G. P. MOLNAR
A Materialist Theory of the Mind.
D. M. Armstrong. Routledge and
Kegan Paul. London. $7.80.
MATERIALISM IS an avowedly
metaphysical doctrine with long and
distinguished history. Reality, accord-
ing to materialism, is ultimately physi-
cal. What exists? “Atoms in the void,”
answered Democritus, more than two
millenia ago. The phenomenon of
mind has given rise to the traditionally
strongest objections to materialism, for
the mind does not seem to be explain-
able on purely material terms. Conse-
quently, the touchstone of philosophi-
cal materialism has often been the
account it gave of mental concepts.
So far materialism has failed to pass
this crucial test. Materialism up to
now (we are not talking about dialecti-
cal materialism) has tried to prove
that the nature of the mental is to be
physical, or, in other words, that the
very idea of the mind is that of some-
thing material. The arguments to this
conclusion turned out to be defective
and the objections to it thoroughly con-
vincing. Materialists have not man-
aged to shake our native, pre-
philosophical conviction that it is not
the nature of mind to be physical.
But, since materialists were commit-
ted to the view that to be real is to
be material, the inevitable implication
of their metaphysics was that minds
are not real! One gained this impres-
sion from materialists who acknow-
ledged that man had an inner life
(“motions of the principal part of the
Body,” said Hobbes), as well as from
those who adopted behaviourism. For
the former painted an unrecognisable
picture of man’s inner mental life,
while the latter appeared to deny its
existence altogether. Thus materialism
could make no serious headway: on the
rock of our invincible conviction that
minds are real though not by nature
material, its otherwise perhaps attrac-
tive claims shattered.
These are the problems with which
David Armstrong, Challis Professor of
Philosophy at Sydney University, is
concerned in his latest book. He tries
to avoid repeating the mistake of the
Old Materialism. He freely allows that
it is not part of the very idea of the
mind to be material. The philosopher’s
job, according to him, is to show that
the very idea of the mind is neutral as
between materialism and its rivals. We
cannot hope to prove, by conceptual
analysis alone, that mind is matter, nor
that it is spirit. All we can hope to
demonstrate is that mind could be mat-
ter, not that it must be matter.
This is the sense in which the New
Materialism provides a neutral analysis
of the concept of mind. The final
answer as to what mind actually is will
be given by science. A viable material-
ism, Armstrong holds, is only partly
philosophically provable; previous
materialists had gone wrong in failing
to appreciate this. They tried to argue,
on an a priori basis, that mind is mat-
ter; they should have confined them-
selves to arguing that it is possible that
mind is matter.
The bulk of “A Materialist Theory
of the Mind” is devoted to detailed
analyses of various mental concepts,
geared to showing that the notion of
mind contains nothing to exclude the
possibility of identifying the mind with
the central nervous system. The level
of sophistication of this part of the
book far exceeds that of any previous
materialist doctrine. The full details
of the argument cannot be reproduced,
or even sketched in a review, but some
central examples can be mentioned.
Armstrong endorses the widely
accepted view that the difference be-
tween bodily motions and actions is to
be located in the purposiveness of the
latter. In analysing the Will he holds
that the idea of purpose, or intention,
is that of an inner cause of outward
motion. It is not, however, part of the
idea of purpose that it is a material
cause, nor that it is non-material. An
intention is merely “that which is apt
for producing of outward behaviour”;
its substantial character being a matter
for empirical determination.
The model invoked here, as elsewhere
in the book, is the biological concept
of a gene. The gene is just “that
which is apt for the transmission of
hereditary characteristics.” Until
recently little more could be said of
the gene except what is summed up
in such a formula. Recent work in bio-
chemistry appears to have identified
the DNA molecule as the vehicle of
heredity. If this scientific result is
accepted one can say that the gene is
the DNA molecule meaning not
that it is the nature of the gene to
be the DNA molecule but that the
thing which transmits hereditary char-
acteristics is, as a matter of scientific
fact, a certain chemical structure.
Similarly, an intention is not of neces-
Armstrong...a new sophistication
in materialism
sity a state of the central nervous
system, but, pending certain neuro-
physiological findings, an intention may,
in fact, be identical with a “brain-
state,” just as genes are in fact identi-
cal with DNA molecules.
Regarding perception, Armstrong
argues for two interlocking theses: first,
that the having of perceptions is the
acquiring of beliefs; and, second, that
to have a belief is to be disposed to
certain behaviour. But since behavioural
dispositions require an underlying
activating state, belief is ultimately
equated with that inner state of man
which causes the outward motion ex-
pressive of his belief. For example: if I
am hungry and believe that the sub-
stance in front of me is food, then,
other things being equal, I will eat it.
The eating “expresses” the belief that
the stuff is food. Now, according to
Armstrong, being in a belief state is
being in the state which causes such
expressive behaviour. This state can be
the state of something material (for
example, the brain), but as far as
philosophical wisdom can show, it could
be the state of a spiritual substance. The
decision rests with science.
Consciousness is reduced to aware-
ness. I am conscious when I am aware
of something, be that object in the out-
side world, as in perception, or within
me, as in introspection. Mental pro-


cesses scan their environment, receive
information from it, and react to such
information. Sometimes they do so
without themselves being objects of
awareness: then they are unconscious.
But often they themselves are scanned.
Being conscious, in the sense of “know-
ing what one is doing,” is to be under-
stood on the model of a self-scanning
apparatus: some active mental state is
itself the object of (internal) percep-
tion by another mental state.
The discussion throughout the book
is eminently lucid, much of it is in-
genious, sometimes outstandingly so.
Armstrong’s volume has certainly man-
aged to supersede all previous defences
of materialism. Nevertheless, one must
have reservations about the success of
the venture as a whole. A great number
of objections occur on points of detail,
the cumulative pressure of which is
in the end hard to escape.
The gene/DNA-molecule relation
seems ineptly chosen to illustrate the
identity of mind and matter. For
whereas prior to the discovery of the
DNA molecule no one could claim to
have detailed knowledge of the intrinsic
(chemico-physical) characteristics of the
gene, philosophers and non-philosophers
alike think that we have for long
known at least some of the intrinsic
characteristics of minds, independently
of the findings of science. This claim
to knowledge may be mistaken, but it
is not to be brushed aside lightly. What
the gene illustrates is that concepts
designed to carry minimum commit-
ments can be introduced into a lan-
guage, but this hardly shows that the
mind is such a concept.
Many of the difficulties which Arm-
strong’s view faces flow from the effort
to push through a “neutral” analysis
of mental concepts. Thus the analysis
of the Will seems to cut out, in one
move, the notion of the active self.
This is one of our most deeply
entrenched ideas about personal caus-
ality: we are strongly convinced that
persons are sometimes genuine, ultimate
authors of their actions. If Armstrong
is right in saying that the ultimate
cause of an action is an inner happen-
ing, then all talk of actions being in our
control must be abandoned as based on
illusion. So also must the idea of free-
dom in connection with actions. This
is hard to accept simply as a conse-
quence of a priori analysis.
The two-part story about perception
is problematic in both of its parts, but
especially so in the linkage between
perception and behaviour. Surely there
is more to the experience of seeing red
than coming into possession of the
information that enables one to (say)
distinguish ripe apples from unripe
ones. What is distinctive about seeing
red may not be readily verbalisable, but
it is utterly familiar to all sighted
people. It is not plausible that an
account of an experience so striking as
color-perception should run exhaustively
in terms of the behaviour arising from
the experience. Seeing red is something
in its own right, we feel. Armstrong’s
account eliminates the content of the
experience. It’s doubtful if an account
of perception impoverished in this res-
pect can be acceptable.
Again, is consciousness merely the
flow of information? This theory dis-
tinguishes too sharply between being
aware of something and being aware
of one’s awareness. These two, as has
often been pointed out, are not neces-
sarily two different things. Conscious-
ness most commonly appears to us as
the transparency of our actions: when
we are active and conscious, we are
acting consciously, all in the one pack-
age as it were. Armstrong’s doctrine of
introspection (due of John Anderson)
as the scanning of one mental state by
another commits him to giving sense to
repeated iterations of the relation
“being aware of,” far beyond what
seems sensible. A computer can have
ever so many parts which scan each
other serially, but there is nothing in
our mental life to correspond to, say,
being aware of being aware of being
aware of some object. Philosophers
who have talked of consciousness as a
“quality” of experiences may not have
got it entirely right, but there is a great
deal in the phenomenology of mental
life to justify their idiom. All of this is
lost in a neutral analysis.
Asian traveller
By FRANK ROBERTS
Filipinescas: Travels in the Philippines
Today. James Kirkup. $3.85.
KIRKUP IS AN undonnish British aca-
demic who has either lived or travelled
extensively in most of eastern and south-
eastern Asia. He looks at this part of
the world with a clear eye, unobstructed
by veils of British, or any other, custom
or right-thinking, and is the rare
tourist who accepts and enjoys, and,
fortunately, remembers well and plays
it back in warm, sensitive prose.
There is a bonus, too, in that Kirkup,
the very adept writer, is constantly
scanning the changing relationships of
self to environment to self. The book
becomes much more than a well-written
account of travel with mild adventures.
It is also a self-portrait formed against
a striking background.
A quick snapshot, on a boat coming
in to Zamboanga: “Only a few people
are stirring on the decks at this early
hour. They present a fantastic sight,
all huddled together in the abandon-
ment of sleep, legs and arms thrown
wide apart, faces wearing the expres-
sions of lost people. Gradually the
country people wake, stretching,
yawning, pissing over the side of the
boat. The aroma of the first cigarettes
and stogies fills the fresh sea air. The
foam swishes against the sides of the
ship with the sound of a woman’s silken
underclothes rustling as she descends
a flight of steps, wave by wave, step by
step.
“No matter whom I meet for the
Kirkup in Tokyo
first time, after a few minutes I cannot
help feeling how dissimilar he (or she)
is to myself. The barrier is nearly
always insuperable, and can only 'briefly
be broken down by immediate sexual
relations; then perhaps we can exchange
a few words. I like Filipinas so
practical, smart, wily, and strong. But
they remind me of the hen-like women
of Jane Austen’s dreadful novel, her
worst, “Sense and Sensibility”
beady-eyed, sharp-tongued, inquisitive,
small-headed, shrill-voiced, and always
on the lookout for ‘advantage.’ ”
AT THE KOTO SCHOOL,
MORIOKA
On the cool, wide, matted floor,
As on a shore of golden sands bordered
by horse-tail grasses
The dreaming girls in lyrical kimono
and obi
The mermaid colors of sun and shells
and waves and weeds
Kneel at their brown boards stringed
with light
Whose grained pawlonia wood
Seems weathered, like ancient bridges
Like sea-smoothed planks, decked with
brocade and loops of silk,
Cast away, long ago, from sunken ships.
The kneeling girls raise square-clawed
fingers,
Their long hands like seagulls’ wings
That gently swoop together in a first
trembling chord, the water’s cry.
Like sirens, they bend their pure napes,
their gleaming hair
Over the long nets, the speaking strings,
that sprinkle
The air of spring with crystal sea-spray,
the melodies
That foam, fall, splash and linger like
dying ripples
Over a wild beach, where the dreaming
girls
Lean over their boards like hanging
waves.

Slant-Eyed Angel. J. van der Hoeven.
Colin Smythe.
IT CAN HAPPEN to anyone a
subnormal child. It is no longer con-
sidered someone’s “fault,” it is not
usually hereditary in the accepted
sense, it is not necessarily the state
of health of either partner, environ-
ment, background, or age, it is not the
sins of the fathers, nor a judgment,
nor a social stigma to be kept in the
attic. It is just the luck of the lottery.
Indeed, statistics are said to show that
fathers of such children are more likely
to be over average intelligence, and
although in some types the age of
the average mothers seems to be around
36 or 37, there are enough exceptions
to render this inconclusive. Science now
knows that one form of abnormality,
Down’s Syndrome (or mongolism) is
caused by a chromosome too many, 47
instead of the normal 46. But what
causes that? Research is still going on.
The author of this unusual book is
a Dutch barrister whose fourth son was
a mongol. His simple, personal, un-
pretentious story of how he and his
wife came at last to welcome this
little changeling into their lives, turn-
ing disaster into a sort of painful vic-
tory, will be a comfort and inspiration
to many with subnormality in the
family. Apart from a brief, easily
understandable scientific introduction
by Georgia Clark, it is primarily the
account of a spiritual journey from the
moment of unwilling acceptance (be-
ing the last to recognise that the infant
was not normal, the parents had actu-
ally to be persuaded by their GP),
right through to genuine love and
affection.
The first step was to face and admit
it, the next to begin a new version of
counting one’s blessings: unlike some
types of abnormality, the mongol is
cheerful and contented. Aat is a happy
boy living in a happy world of his own,
untouched by the cares and anxieties
of day-to-day existence, asking for little
and being completely satisfied with what
he gets. Who is to say that he is to be
pitied? Through him, the van der
Hoevens all gradually learn to add a
new dimension to their own way of
thinking. They make the old argument
of the “saintly fool” take on added
meaning.
The father was further strengthened
by an enviable faith, and compares his
experiences with Jacob wrestling with
the Angel. He feels himself purified,
even privileged; he calls himself “elect.”
He writes, “One’s life is finally decided
less by happenings and circumstances
themselves, than by the light which
falls on it, and the light in which we
see it.” When, for instance, Aat becomes
seriously ill and they have the “choice”
of allowing him to die, they nurse him
back to life, contending with much ad-
verse neighborly gossip in the process.
Soon another period of agony and
decision follows: the author’s wife sus-
pects she has been exposed to German
measles during her next pregnancy.
Must she risk adding a deaf or blind
child to her family, as well? As it hap-
pens, the fifth son is born completely
normal, but if he had not been . . .
This, too, is a problem many have had
to face since the Australian specialist,
the late Sir Norman Gregg, discovered
the connection between rubella and sub-
sequent deformity many years ago.
“Slant-Eyed Angel” makes no claims
to literary honors, but it is a sincere
human document that admirably fulfils
its aim of offering some practical help
(showing how a mongol child can de-
velop his own capabilities, express him-
self, respond to music, etc.), some philo-
sophical guidance, and, above all, some
genuine understanding to other parents
of subnormal children.
Gag-stricken
By JOHN BAXTER
The Vale Of Laughter. Peter de Vries.
Gollancz. $3.85.
THIS IS the time of the wisecrack,
and the voice heard through the land
is most likely to be that of the stand-
up comedian. American humor seems,
since the war, to have gone over
entirely to the tart comedy of humilia-
tion and despair, one oasis in the other-
wise barren desert being the pages of
the “New Yorker,” where writers like
S. J. Perelman, James Thurber, and
Peter de Vries dispensed humor that
was at once mordant and restrained.
Today, unfortunately, Perelman is a
burnt-out case, Thurber dead, and
de Vries has, in his new novel, “The
Vale Of Laughter,” gone over at least
partly to the forces of comedie noire.
Not that “The Vale Of Laughter”
isn’t funny. If you are tuned in to
the author’s wavelength, the adventures
of Joe Sandwich as he jokes his way
through life must leave you per-
manently in stitches; Joe Sandwich, who
never sinned as a child but confessed
to a puzzled priest long lists of good
deeds like helping old ladies across the
street, any proceeds from which he
had contributed to the church poorbox.
The priest, bemused, gives him two
Hail Marys for the sin of pride.
Having thus had destroyed his faith in
the church, he finds a substitute in
humor.
Joe pursues the worship of the gag
with relentless energy. “Don’t you take
anything seriously?” somebody asks
him. “Only medicine,” he replies with
a sort of gloomy reflex. Falling in
love with a girl named “Naughty”
McNaughton, he is invited to dinner
with the parents, engaging in a war
of attrition with the stolid Mc-
Naughton pere. “How do you like the
Mercedes?” Joe is asked. “If you
got long legs dey feel a little stiff
when you get out. My doctor calls dot
condition de Mercedes Bends.” “How
many miles do you get to the gallon?”
the father presses on, unfazed. Any-
body but Joe would have given up,
but humor is fast religion
with him.
His marriage to “Naughty” is less
than completely successful. She finds
it hard to adjust to his fascination with
rubber stamps “Prime” all over her
buttocks, “Overdue” on his private
parts. Equally disturbing is his use
of an aerosol can of strawberry jam to
coat her breasts. “Love is an art,”
he explains as he licks it off. “I
thought you might notice my craft
ebbing,” but she is unamused even by
recitations from his collection of funny
names (“Cora Loudermilk . . . Mod-
jeska Balkanblend . . . Wilbur Left-
suckle . . .”).
Only infrequently does the couple
reach a complete communion, the most
memorable occasion being when they
participate in an at-home ' test for
friends who are compiling material on
sexual reactions. Wired up to a variety
of recording apparatus, banded with
rubber tubes, and studded with elec-
trodes Joe and “Naughty” conduct a
coupling which sounds more like a
routine for cross-talk comedians. “So
you’re the new personnel manager,” he
says, “I trust you have a little opening
for me.” And continues, “Now I would
like to introduce an upright member,
one of long standing, who is a firm
candidate for congress.” Moved to
heights of passion, Naughty responds
with quotations from Shakespeare and
Victor Hugo while the recorders tick
remorselessly on.
This is the pattern of Joe’s life, sex
and comedy equally mixed. Life for
him is a vale of laughter, the universe
one huge joke, yet he seems to derive
little pleasure from his existence. The
clown, de Vries suggests, is often a
disorientated man caught in a pattern
of compulsive behaviour as unreward-
ing as any tic, driven by a dread that
if he is ever caught without a wise-
crack on his lips, something terrible
will happen to him.
The author expands this theory in


the second half of the book, telling the
story of Joe’s last years of life from
the point of view of a humorless out-
sider who is immune to his charm.
Wally Hines lectures on humor to his
university class, drily dissecting jokes
and probing for the irreducible ingredi-
ent that makes Joe, and others like
him, funny. Although he puts forward
a number of theories as to what con-
stitutes humor, his efforts are doomed
to fail. Humor, it seems, cannot be
analysed. As Wally proves by his
lack of response, only the man laugh-
ing knows what’s so funny, and he is
usually laughing too hard to explain.
“The Vale Of Laughter” is not de
Vries’ humor as “New Yorker” read-
ers have come to know it. Self-
conscious in some ways, it is as much
a treatise on humor as a work of enter-
tainment. And as absurd as its charac-
ters are, we may find more absurd the
sight of an established humorous writer
trying to analyse the qualities which
make him funny. Too often the joke
is not on Joe Sandwich but on the
writer.
ALONE
Strangers and friends seem fewer
now. Disease
And age and chance leave few con-
temporaries.
They tell me Joe has gone — suddenly,
And I reply, “What about me?”
What about me? Few visits from the
few
Who know my name. “How are you?”
They say politely, pause and go
Humoring senility. Time is slow.
And death is surely coming. And I
fear
The cold of dark suits, the false cheer
of aging daughters bearing sweets
Or cigars. My heart still beats.
My mind recalls—but what is his
name?
In business I did well. The salesmen
came
Waiting outside for interviews
Queuing to bring me company news.
My sons are rich, for youth inherits
all.
That’s what their mother in her joy
would call
The family talent. The takeover bid —
Now they enjoy the work I did.
It doesn’t matter now. The sun has
gone.
No longer bright or hot as once it
shone.
On holidays I sit by my fire
/ walk across the room and tire.
Alone and knowing I am out of
touch.
I let the reins. I expect too much.
Too old to reverence or please
Too tired now to bend my knees.

I RECEIVED an irate letter from a

bitterly about a traditional French dish
I had mentioned, which, it appears,
she prepared for some friends coming

Before I go any further with this

whether or not you can actually make
it but whether indeed you are going
to like it. If you expect a catastrophe,
invite the kind of friends who’ll have
fun in sharing the catastrophe . . .
and not someone you wish to impress.
I ran through a few dishes for this
article again the other night, and when
we got to the main course in came
the glowing hibachi on a trolley, and
on went the spareribs. Thanks to the
butcher, who had been overgenerous
with the fat on the ribs, the entire
dining-room was enveloped in smoke.
My guests, bless them, helped to open
the doors and windows, donned their
sweaters, replaced their shoes, and
tucked into the spareribs, smiling
through their tears and enjoyed
every last morsel!
Korean cuisine is based on rice,
beef, pork, fish, poultry, and fresh
fruit. Soybean is an important ingredi-
ent, as are sesame seeds, pine nuts,
soy sauce, garlic, red pepper, sugar,
honey, fresh ginger, and monosodium
glutamate. Kim Chee is served at
almost every meal. It is a pickle
made from sliced turnip, shallots, red
pepper, Chinese cabbage, and other
vegetables, and can be purchased in
jars from shops selling oriental food.
All oriental meals include soup (not
necessarily at the beginning). A light
consomme made from meat or poultry
flavored with vegetables, briefly cooked,
and seasoned with monosodium gluta-
mate and soy sauce is easy to make.
This could be followed by a fish course.
The Japanese are leaders in this field
and serve sashimi (raw fish) or tempura
(a mixture of fish, shellfish, and thinly
sliced vegetables dipped lightly into a
thin batter, fried at the table, and
devoured with a light sauce made
from stock, soy sauce, monosodium
glutamate, sugar, salt and pepper,
thickened with cornflour).
Gui Kui would be my choice for a
dinner party. You’ll need individual
shells for each guest, or small cas-
seroles, and the whole thing is pre-
pared before your guests arrive, and
takes 30 minutes to cook.
One pound crab meat, 1 tin bean
sprouts, onion and 3 shallots and 5
water chestnuts (all three finely chop-
ped), 4 eggs, 1 teaspoon cornflour, 2
teaspoons monosodium glutamate,
seasoning, and toasted sesame seeds for
garnish. Mix well-drained and chop-
ped bean sprouts with other finely
chopped vegetables and the crab. Stir
eggs, do not beat (to prevent runni-
ness), and add to crab and vegetables.
Add seasoning and mix very lightly.
Spoon into greased baking shells and
bake at 400 deg. F. for 25 minutes.
Prepare tempura sauce as mentioned
above, stirring constantly until thick-
ened.
Before serving, pour two tablespoons-
of sauce over each dish and sprinkle
with toasted sesame seeds.
Koreans love barbecued meats, and
sliced beef, chicken, pork, and duck
are all marinated in the same manner
and then crisped over charcoal. When
barbecuing inside (like me) use a
fireplace to avoid being choked with
smoke (a lesson I have just learned
the hard way).
Traditionally such food is eaten in
the fingers so have plenty of nap-
kins handy.
For Kahlbi Kui (barbecued spare-
ribs) you will need 41b. pork spare-
ribs for six people.
Prepare the marinade as follows:
Mix 4 tablespoons soy sauce with 2
tablespoons sherry, 2 tablespoons oil,
2 tablespoons brown sugar, 4 cloves
minced garlic, a square inch of fresh
minced ginger, a few chopped shal-
lots, 4 teaspoons sesame seeds, 1 tea-
spoon monosodium glutamate, and salt
and pepper.
Trim fat from ribs. Very thick ribs
should be split in half. Slash pieces of
rib every half-inch with a sharp knife.
Sprinkle lightly with salt and rub a
little brown sugar into the bones
(using no more than 4 tablespoons of
sugar for 41b. meat). Place into
marinade and leave for at least two
hours (longer will give better flavor).
If you want to chicken out of the
barbecue altogether, these may be
baked in a hot oven.
Fresh fruit is the traditional finale
to a meal. The host is required to
peel the fruit with a small knife, then
cut it into pieces, and spear each
piece with a toothpick so that guests
can eat it easily.
Cho Raan is a sweetmeat which can
be prepared to eat with the tea finale.
You’ll need lib. dates, 3 tablespoons
sugar, 1 teaspoon cinnamon, and 3
tablespoons pine nuts. Chop the dates
well, add sugar and cinnamon and
shape into balls the size of a small
walnut. Roll in finely chopped pine
nuts and then flatten with the palm
of your hand into squares.
Korean dates are bright red but
taste the same as ours. Perhaps it’s
only a matter of politics.

AUSTRALIA’S LEADING PERMANENT BUILDING SOCIETY
Letters
Boyd and Hodgkinson
Is there never to be an end to the
ghastly, hack device of comparing
painters, or writers, in Australian criti-
cism? The ingenuity of these desperate
contortions, in themselves often an
astonishment and wonder, is an exhibi-
tion of the impoverishment that clutches
such clanking mechanics. Elwyn Lynn’s
review of the shows of Arthur Boyd
and Frank Hodgkinson, possibly the
most disparate of Australian painters,
advances this grinning skull of con-
trivance to its mad, logical end.
The declaration that Hodgkinson has
not the coherence with Lorca that he
seeks is a sublime impertinence. Does
Lynn mean the coherence with Lorca
he would seek were he painting? I
talked with Hodgkinson while he pre-
pared this work. He explained very
vividly what he was after and how he
would get it.
After painting in Spain for eight
years, beginning in 1947, having shown
at the Prado and having been included
in the massive, official volume of
Spanish painters, without reference to
his origin, one feels compelled to believe
that Hodgkinson’s involvement is closer
than Lynn could understand.

Australian laughter
The Shorter Oxford defines a laugh as
the manifestation of “the spasmodic
utterance, facial distortion, shaking of
the sides, etc., which forms the instinc-
tive expression of mirth, amusement,
sense of the ludicrous, scorn, etc.” Denis
O’Brien (8., May 4) seeks out the
causes of this spasmodic utterance in
Australia with admirable diligence.
Strangely, however, he seems to have
neglected the medium of the cinema.
One could not deny the laughter caused
by such screen masterpieces as Jacques
Tati’s “Mon Oncle,” the Goons’ “Run-
ning, Jumping and Standing Still
Film,” early Sellers and late Lemmon.
It would be easy to go on, of course,
but this facial distortion and shaking
of the sides is a pretty personal thing.
It can be pretty sinister, too. Consider
its implications in the persuasion pro-
fession. A cinema advertisement cur-
rently showing in London for a well-
known banking group uses laughter in
a rather frightening manner. For the
duration of the commercial a character
is shown going about his normal bank-
ing business convulsed in laughter, the
infectious laugh spreads, mob
psychology prevails, and the whole
audience is convulsed. And sold. They
laugh all the way to the bank.
Billy Graham attempted this tech-
nique in his recent crusade. Part of his
modus operandi is to soften-up his con-
gregation with home-spun humor. Un-
fortunately, however, instead of laugh-
ing, a “Tonight Show” - conditioned
audience broke into applause. Could it
be that even our response to humor is
one of action rather than reaction?
Consider also the great Australian mate-
ship and the resultant gather-round-the-
keg-type jokes. Dirty rather than risque.
Physical rather than cynical. Could it
be that Australians just laugh when
they are happy?

Wrong Strachey
May I correct a serious misunder-
standing in Peter Coleman’s review of
my book “Intellectuals and Politics”?
The man whom I quote as an example
of the “concerned” intellectual in poli-
tics is not Lytton Strachey an
“alienate” par excellence but the
late John Strachey, a Labor politician
of high calibre and an outstanding
intellectual.

Muggeridge and Strachey
I was amused and indignant on
reading Muggeridge’s review of Hol-
royd’s biography of Lytton Strachey,
vol. 2 (8., May 11). Muggeridge
reminds me of the growth of insects so
vividly described by my old entomology
teacher. Insect young are called “min-
iature replica” of the adult, an apt term
also applicable to literature. For Mug-
geridge is a minature replica of
Strachey, droning on year after year
in unconscious parody of his master.
But he never grows up. Perhaps this is
why he despises the master so much?
Strachey’s genius consists precisely in
his instinct for form, in his ability to
give exactly the right weight to each
particle of his work to produce an
artistic whole, to select, unerringly, the
significant trifles from the myriad facts
of history and biography. When bare
facts are essential Strachey gives us bare
facts (e.g. the first chapter of Queen
Victoria), when analysis is required, he
analyses (e.g. Queen Elizabeth’s sex-
•uality), when people behave absurdly,
he satirises.
The whole of Bloomsbury is casu-
ally consigned to Hades, just for
good measure, with the exception of
Leonard Woolf. Let Muggeridge note —
whatever one may despise or dislike
about the inhabitants of Bloomsbury
they diligently followed to perfection
the motto of yet another queer, Gide:
“Each man to his task.” Each, in spite
of idiocies of temperament (and it is
insolence to judge art by lives in any
case), used his talents to the full in
his own way.

We think it was significant that one man was thinking about
power to weight ratio at a time when other manufacturers
were making juggernauts. His name was Louis Renault and
his brother Marcel won the first Paris to Vienna race in a 30
h.p. rulebreaker against competitors with more than double
this rating. It matters to every Renault driver today that
back in 1898 Louis Renault was the original rulebreaker. Give
your spirit of adventure the chance to be rewarded drive
