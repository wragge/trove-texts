The “In-Built” Quality Roofing.
Other roofings may look the same as Malthoid on the surface, but
Malthoid is good through and through; the quality is in-built. Made from
the finest “rag” felt, and saturated with the Malthoid waterproofing
fluid prepared in the Malthoid works, this remarkable roofing will stand
the severest tests of weather.
The reputation of the Paraffine Companies stands back, of Malthoid—
it is the best ready roofing we know how to make.

The Red Pag e
The Pharisees
An interesting little book is What the
World Owes to the Pharisees, by R. Travers
Herford, with a preface by General Monash
and' a postscript by Captain H. M. Adler
(Geo. Allen and Unwin, publishers). The
author announces himself as a Unitarian,
which explains his position, Mohammedan,
Unitarian and Jew stand together on the
doctrine of a single Deity as against the
Trinity, the orthodox, so there is an endur-
ing bond among them. The case put for-
ward on behalf of the Pharisee is a good one,
but in reality no defence is needed. The
Pharisee of various sorts —seven species have
been identified by ornithologists and others
—was the Covenanter or Puritan of Judaism.
In his most pronounced form he answered to
John Knox or Praise-God Barebones. In
his mildest form he was simply a constant
worshipper on the back seat and a consistent
but unobtrusive dropper of his coin in the
plate. lie evolved an idea of the immor-
tality of the soul about which the Old Tes-
tament is rather non-commital. The
Sadducee gave it up. The two sects
made up the Jewish nation, just as
Roman Catholics and Protestants make
up the Australian nation —there were
sundries of many sorts, but active or nominal
Pharisees and Sadducees composed the bulk.
They were a tolefant crowd. Even the
Knox and* Barebones end of them was always
ready to hear the opinions of apostles and
sectaries, and they permitted strange
preachers to debate in their synagogues in a
manner which a modern Salvationist or
Seventh Day Believer wouldn’t dream of.
But they definitely broke with the new men
when Paul developed the idea of a com-
posite church, including niggers, eunuchs,
Chinamen (if procurable) and sundries.
There were other points, but this was an
important one. The Pharisees regarded their
faith as one means of keeping the nation
together, and had no demand for niggers
and eunuchs. The missionary spirit, which
consists in possessing the only true faith and
frankly telling the next man that his creed
is bogus and that his supposed Rembrandt
is a blighted oleograph—the spirit of aggres-
sive bigotry and itinerant intolerance and
interference-with-the-best-intentions wasn’t
in them. In fact, it was in very few people
until Paul’s day, for though the old. Hebrews
had a profound “derry” on Moloch and Baal
in their own country, they seldom chased
Moloch into his native territory. It is hard
to say what might have happened in the way
of reconciliation or compromise if Paul hadn’t
lost his temper—always short —and ended
the discussion about, the Messiahship and
other affairs, and taken his way to the Gen-
tiles. There always remains-a vision of the
back view of Paul as he departed carrying
History, little as he knew it, in his hand —
a brief figure with short, thin, gaitered legs
twinkling beneath the tails of a long black
frock-coat, his black soft hat stuck fiercely on
the back of his head and liis cotton umbrella
in violent agitation. He also carried a small
black bag with tracts in it. Possibly a ter-
rier ran behind him.
The Pharisees, with their unflinching
nationalism, kept the faith and the wreck of
the nation together after the great fall. Most
of the great Jewish community of Egypt
was absorbed in the adjacent multitude when
the ruin of the Temple convinced them that
the game was finished. Presumably they
were largely Sadducees ; the Sadducee with
no hereafter lacked a rallying point when the
big building collapsed. But the Pharisee,
having a future before him, gathered up his
religion and carried it to all the lands of the
earth, including China, where traces of Ah
Moses remain to this day. He was an In-
stitution —learned, patriotic, ingenious,-
patient, indomitable —and he remains so to
this day. He- is the nearest thing to im-
mortality in the realm of Mind. The sea-
serpent and the cedar of Lebanon don’t
approach him for durability. Storms pass
over him; plagues dodge him ; rocks rebound
off him. His last very notable public ap-
pearance was leading the Australian army
in France, and no one can say he led it
badly.
J. E.
Dialect
An unfortunate philosophy seems to be
afoot amongst local writers with regard to
beings Australian. The idea is that to be
intensely and typically so you must sing
in a perverted variety of Billingsgate.
Fifty per cent, of modern Australian verse
is written in the alleged dialect of Outback
—or of Surry Hills. Most of it affects the
attenuated line of Lawson and Ogilvie; I
refer to the line in the metre of
Have you heard the bunyip howling in the Great
Australian Bush?”
This (ye Muses!) is considered typically
Australian! Just as “On Our Selection”
appears to be the very model of the true
Australian drama!
The remorseless fact is that dialect of
any description is fatal to poetry. It kills
it. Take the glaring example of “The Senti-
mental Bloke.” Mr. Dennis makes his char-
acters speak in the slang of Five Docks.
Why not go the whole hog and have them
speak in the prose of their every-day con-
versation? It would be no more improbable
for them to speak in cultured English than
for them to speak in verse. And, on the
other hand, if it’s impossible to imagine a
rabbit-oh talking in rhyme and metre (as,
of course, it is), why in the name of rea-
son try to force nature upon his elegiacs, in
the shape of his native idioms? There is
no half-way house. Either a character
speaks in verse, in which case his language
must be poetic, or else he speaks in prose,
and as realistically as his creator dares.
There can be no compromise such as rhymed
dialect.
The truth is that, in real poetry, con-
versation or any other form of speech can-
not possibly exist. No poetic characters
speak. The poet is not concerned for one
minute with their actual utterances; the
poetry is in their thoughts.
Obviously, no sane mortal speaks m verse;
hence (and very logically) if a poet endows
his characters with an. attempt at their
actual speech, his poem must be considered
unnatural and forced. But the essential
poet does not try to do this. If he wanted
to hold an accurate mirror to their speech
he would have to do it in prose. He is
concerned with their thoughts alone; and
ne expresses those thoughts in the form of
poetry. Hence, when Mr. Dennis’s charac-
ters are made to speak in metrical slang and
rhymed dialect, it can never be allowed that
the result is poetry- It’s true that the
hawker of WooLoomooloo talks in the
peculiar dialect of that locality; but I en-
tirely deny that he thinks in slang. How
can he? You can’t drop a visionary “h.”
And poetry is concerned with his thoughts.
I would ask the critics who cite the
obvious examples of the dialect-verse of
Burns, Tennyson, etc., to consider Shaks-
peare. As soon as he approaches dialect
( e.g ., the Welsh of Fluellen, or the slang
of Falstaff) he discards the form of poetry
for a colloquial prose. There is not a passage
of dialect in the whole of his works m
metrical shape. As for Burns and Tenny-
son, there is no more poetry in the dialect
portions of “The Cotter’s Saturday Night”
than there is in the “Eh? Good daay, good
daay! Thaw it bean’t not much of a daay”
parts of Tennyson.
KENNETH SLESSOR.
Galsworthy and the Common Man
The great change of the nineteenth cen-
tury was a movement of the wage-earning
multitudes from the fields to the city. It
was a change which fostered the growth of
democracy, and out of it a new literature
of social protest has arisen. The common
man has formed the subject of novels and
poems by nearly all recent writers, ffib 1 a
Whitman and Wells to Romain Holland am!
Emile Verhaeren; and John Galsworthy has
reinstated him in drama.
11. G. Wells and Bernard Shaw both sur-
vey the squalid course of contemporary life
in England: both regard it as something
which screams to indifferent Heaven as an
offence. Both would eagerly enter upon a
I crusade for a new republic, and welcoxpi
the breeding of the Superman. Robert
Blatchford has descended to the lowest level
of human life to the vindication .of the
under dogs. Galsworthy’s attitude is not
so much that of a purely social reformer as
of an artist with an instinct for social re-
form. He is an onlooker, intensely interested
and sympathetic towai'ds the bourgeoisie,
that multitude of half-lost, undistinguisued
people, hurrying •in the early morning on
crowded trains and tramcars, swirling back-
wards and forwards from the outskirts of
cities to the centres of labor; the uncertain
agglomeration of weekly wage-earners, drift-
ing with all surrounding human lives through
their narrow space' of being towards the
Great Unknown.
The drama of Galsworthy is the drama ot
social contrast. He appears on the stage
with a pair of scales and to test
the social values. The epigrammatic draw-
ing-room comedy of Wilde does not concern
the common man, who does not deal in
epigrams; and the' society dramas of the
West End have no place for lnm. Gals-
worthy’s art is the art of exhibition lie
takes up the drawing-room floor and shows
you the kitchen. He examines the psycho-
logy of the butler as minutely as that 01
the member of Parliament.’ It isliispur-
pose to display the great fund of human
interest behind the pages of the morning
newspapers. There are criminals, char-
women, hawkers, prostitutes,-the drunken
and the casually employed-; the fre&ffanc
jeurnalist Malise, the social reformer Henry
More, the bohemian artist Wellwyn, the lan
guid lord, the gamekeeper, the prisoner Wil-
liam Falder beating the door of his cell,
the “lady of quality” endeavoring to keep
herself unspotted behind the counter m a
drapery store: the whole typical, many-
colored mob of human beings struggling and
drifting in a perpetual stream under the
quiet stars. , . .
Dramatic art can take up any subject,
even the most repellent, so long as it can be
shown to concern human interests. -ffhe
main point for the dramatist is, Can he lift
his subject into the sphere of art? _ Gals-
worthy has realised that modern society is
hampered by a mass of out-worn conventions,
obsolete creeds, age-old customs and enact-
merits. He sets out to exhibit the hardships
which these conventions involve for the com-
mon man. At the same time he sees behind
every individual life the universal longings
and "hopes; and in the schemes of men he
perceives the ideals, so - often clouded under
the prejudice of environing superstition and
ignorance. And he is profoundly dominated
by the beauty and sadness underlying all
the clumsy, inscrutable forces of life. There
is a melancholy yearning towards goodness
and happiness. And in his recognition of tho
injustice ruling this world, seemingly so
capable of happiness—this world of a myriad
human creatures, for whom nature is repre-
sented by a few withered trees; art by the
oleograph and the crude mantel-piece decora-
tions ; religion by the oil-lamp, the quavering
hymn of the corybantic devotee of the Salva-
tion Army, and whose literature is symbol-
ised by the Sunday rag with its dreary gar-
bage of police reports—the pith of his teach-
ing is to be found in the words of Wellwyn
the artist: “People are so awfully human,
Specially the poor.” He recalls Robert
Louis Stevenson : “Ah, if I could show you
this: if I could show you these men and
women, all the world over, in every stage
of history, under every abuse of error, under
every circumstance of failure, without hope,
without help, without thanks, still obscurely
fighting the lost fight for virtue, still cling-
ing in the brothel or on the scaffold to some
rag of honor, the poor jewel of their souls!”
Galsworthy as a dramatist stands in close
relation to Hauptmann, in that he is im-
pelled by pity for human suffering. Bernard
Shaw lias swamped the modern drama with
ideas. Galsworthy has supplied the actual-
ities —and there still remains the art.

HOME RECIPES.

MOUSTACHES.
“Practical Suggestions.”
To women who are annoyed by disfiguring
downy hair growths a method of permanent! >
eradicating the same will come as a piece of
good news. For this purpose pure powdered
pheminol may be used. Almost any chemist
should be able to supply an ounce of this
drug. The recommended treatment is de-
signed not only to remove the disfiguiing
growth instantly, leaving no trace, but also
to actually kill the hair roots, without
irritating the skin.
HOW TO HAVE THICK AND PRETTY
HAIR.
“Home Talents.”
Soaps and artificial shampoos ruin man}
beautiful heads of hair. Few people know
that a teaspoonful of good stallax dissolved m
a cup of hot water has a natural affinity for
the hair and makes the most delightful
shampoo imaginable. It leaves the hair
brilliant, soft and wavy, cleanses the scalp
completely and greatly stimulates the hair
growth. The only drawback is that stallax
seems rather expensive. It comes to . the
chemist only in sealed 1 lb. packages, which
retail at half a crown. However, as this is
sufficient for twenty-five or thirty shampoos,
if reallv works out very cheaply in the end.
BLACKHEADS, OILY PORES, ETC.
A unique new method' instantly removes and
corrects them.
The new sparkling face-bath treatment
rids the skin of blackheads, oiliness and en-
larged pores almost instantly. It is per-
fectly harmless, pleasant and immediately
effective. x\.ll you have to do is to drop _a
stymol tablet, obtained from the chemist s, m
a glass of hot water, and after the resulting
effervescence has subsided dab the affected
portions of the face freely with the liquid.
When you dry the face you will find that the
blackheads come right off on the towel, the
large pores' contract and efface themselves
and the greasiness is all gone, leaving the
skin smooth, soft and cool. This treatment
should be repeated a few times at intervals
of. several days in order to make sure that
the-result shall be permanent.
grey hair unnecessary.
A simple, old-fashioned home-made lotion that
will restore the color of youth.
One need not resort to the very question-
able expedient of hair dye in order not to
have grey hair. The grey hair can easily
he changed back to a natural color in a tew
days’ time merely by the application of a
simple, old-fashioned and perfectly harmless
home-made lotion. Procure from your
chemist two ounces of tammalite concentrate
and mix it with three ounces of bay rum.
Apply this to the hair a few times with a
small sponge, and. you will soon have the
pleasure of seeing your grey hair gradually
darkening to the desired shade. The lotion
is pleasant, not sticky or greasy, and does
not injure the hair in any way. [3

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Fantasy.
There is a stirring in the House of Time;
Out of dark chambers hung with faded gold
And tattered scarlet peer the Years of Old
For one whose wearied footsteps slowly climb
Up from the sleeping earth. Low whispers
go
Through the long corridors where fitful flare
The lamps of History. Some have burnt
there
Down to the wicks* and some no glimmer
show.
Out of their dreaming wake the drowsy
years.
Many have lain unrestful, fearful, red —
They that were years of blood. Too many
dead
They bore with them away, and womon’s
tears
Haunt yet their slumbering. And there are
proud
Years clad in purple, though the golden
stitch
Broidered about their hems with jewels rich
Has frayed, and all their purple is a shroud.
Through tapestried chill rooms the murmurs
flit,
Sighing by banner-folds. In dim brocade,
Half-unseen shapes draw back into the
shade
Till the awed murmurs die, where, all unlit,
stupendous stairways down in blackness
wind
To utter silences, for there in sleep
ihe oldest years of all were sunken deep.
Before in temples men their gods had shrined.
Tbe portals of the House of Time are flung
Wide for the passing year whose feet tread
slow
Over the threshold, worn down, long ago,
Smooth by unnumbered feet. Slowly are
swung
ihe dark doors back, and home the heavv
bars.
Silence holds all. But, from the east, vet
grey,
Half-lit, ere the blue surging-forth of day,
ihe year-to-be comes masked through palinz
stars. h

MANUFACTURING IN AUSTRALIA
The Policy of the Colonies of to-day is to manufacture and become self-supporting as far
as possible.
AUSTRALIA can, and will, enter largely into every sphere of the manufacturing world.
There is much to be said for the Australian mechanic. For the past four years, owing to
shipping restrictions, he has suffered the disadvantages of having to use old and practically
obsolete machine tools, instead of the more modern types; yet he has produced work up to
standard, which speaks volumes for his adaptability. Such adaptibility was under the circum-
stances a great asset, but the METHODS OF PRODUCTION VERY COSTLY AND LABORIOUS.
All restrictions now being removed, presents the opportunity of equipping your shop with
machine tools, representing the very latest practice in manufacturing. Machines that will
be profitable both to those who buy and use them.
Assuming you decide to manufacture, commence where others left off, not where thev began;
but to do this YOU MUST HAVE THE NECESSARY ADVICE in the Selection of Plant,
Equipping of same, and instructions in the efficient handling after installation.
Consider what this means to any firm. The plant produces work immediately on modern
lines, giving the users a quick return on their capital outlav, and supplying Australia’s needs
quickly.
Having had a number of years experience in manufacturing of Machine Tools, etc., and modern-
ising of Engineering Workshops—the last, five years on massed production—we claim the right to
call ourselves MACHINE TOOL EXPERTS, and to back our claim we demonstrate in customers’
works the output capacity of all Manufacturing Machines we supply.
THE FOLLOWING ADVICE IS FREE FOB THE ASKING:—
Rearrangement of your present plant.
Balancing your plant to bring each section into line.
Complete plants, giving guaranteed output on all details of the work you have
under consideration.
Fixing of limits, for interchangeability, which depends entirely on your class
of work.
Finally, to help AUSTRALIA to manufacture.
Our SMALL TOOLS DEPARTMENT is worthy a visit. At the present time we have a good
stock of Norton Grinding Wheels, Chucks, Dies, Drills, Cutters, etc., for all classes of work.
Our Grinding Wheel Specialist will be pleased to advise suitable wheels to anyone who has a
grinding problem to sojve.

AUSTRALIA AND SEA POWER.
A number of terribly significant items were
cabled to Australia last week : ,
(1) The Japanese naval estimates for 1920 amount
to £30,000,000... .probably the largest amount any
nation is spending on naval armaments in proportion
to the national resources.
(2) The programme provides, inter alia, for the
construction of four battleships, four battle-cruisers,
26 cruisers, 82 t.b.d., and 70 submarines, the whole
to be completed in eight years.
(3) The Japanese newspapers approve, declaring
that Britain and America contemplate a naval agree-
ment.
(4) There is bitterness in Japan over the Pacific
mandates. The convention (in Paris) relative to the
Pacific colonies has been deferred, the Japanese re-
questing time.
Simultaneously with the arrival of the Aus-
tralia in the southern waters of the Com-
monwealth there was steaming towards
Japan the Kongo. The Kongo, like the
Australia, was a 1913 ship, with the dif-
ference that it carried 13.5 in. instead of
12in. guns, that its speed was greater and
its armor protection superior. In other words,
the Commonwealth’s battle-cruiser was out-
moded before it was delivered. Japan has
at least five ships capable of blowing the
Australia out of the water with impunity ;
any one of the eight which are to be built
bv 1927 could destroy a dozen Australia* as
safely as if they were ferry-boats.
"Naval defence is still, when all is said and
done, a matter of capital ships. Japan’s
In test programme is only another endorse-
ment of Admiral Jellicoe’s theory as to
the battleship being “the strongest engine
of war which exists for operating in the sea.
England has lately evolved a submarine
which mounts a 12in. gum The day is per-
haps at hand when aerial invaders will ram
super-bombs on enemy railways and cities
2000 and 3000 miles from their base. But
there is no present indication that either -o
them will be able to engage capital ships
_j,u enmesh new means ot aeience ueiug
p'iw bjth: latter to every fresh over-
head or under-water menace ; and a nation
is unbeaten so long as its capital ships hold
the sea.
» * * *
It would be idiotic as well as suicidal for
Australia to politely taboo consideration of
the possibilities of Japan’s great sea-effort.
It was a cardinal principle of the old secret
diplomacy, which has always demonstrated
a ruinous incapacity to avert wars, that no
one should breathe a word about the menac-
ing behavior of foreign nations. Stray
writers and speakers made warning refer-
ences before August, 1914, to Germany’s
remarkable army and astonishing fleet. They
were rebuked in respectable, God-fearing
circles for alarmist behavior, scurrility, inso-
lence towards near relatives of the Royal
family, and ,; bad form” generally. Yet the
tremendous hush which convention imposed
upon the British Empire during so many
years did not hold back the storm by an hour.
It never does. If the Japanese cherish or
develop a grievance against Australia or
America, or if either of the two gets hold
of something which should belong to Japan,
in the latter’s opinion, then Japan will select
a favorable moment, and it will fight. Specu-
lation in newspapers or in Parliaments on
the subject of a nation’s political motives
or its military or naval strength never made
a Government declare war. A nation picks
a quarrel either because it is desperate
through ill-treatment or because it is sure
it will win. Japan has no cause to be
desperate. On the contrary: it is prosper-
ous. it gains in respect and it is free. But
it has an army, and it is acquiring a navy
which will give it a reasonable chance of
success in war \vith any nation. If Aus-
tralia happened to be the enemy selected,
and if it were required to fight “on its own,”
it would not have a dog’s chance on the sea
in the present condition of its navy. The
R.A.N. is relatively of the same standard of
effectiveness as the old subsidised or hired
fleet of six years ago and earlier: “too weak
to fight and too slow to run away.” If
America and Japan clashed Australia might,
probably would, be dragged in. The two
nations would have to practically walk over
this country’s body to get at each other.
* * * *
The Federal Government is still consider-
ing the Jeelicoe Report, with all its implica-
tions in the way of expenditure, in a panic-
stricken frame of mind. Yet the document
might have been written with a prophetic
eye to the. Japanese proposals which were
made public last week. The Far Eastern
fleet to meet the demands of the coming five
years is to consist, if Jellicoe gets his way,
of eight battleships and eight battle-cruisers;
but with 10 light cruisers, as against Japan’s
26, and only half Japan’s quota of t.b.d.’s
and submarines. Australia’s share of the
whole is but 7.74 per cent., involving an
annual maintenance and depreciation cost
of £4,024,600. It is cheap insurance in the
circumstances. We are offered a Lewis-gun,
so to speak, for the price of an old re-
volver ; a Mills bomb for a packet of
crackers. And even if Jellicoe’s financial
demands had been much greater, Australia
would be forced to acquiesce in the end. The
war showed nothing more clearly than that
defence on the cheap is the equivalent of
no defence at all. Either this country can
say to Japan: “We throw 7 ourselves entirely
on your goodwill and forbearance. We mean
to stick to our mandates and dependencies
and to retain our racial and industrial stan-
dards by barring your nationals, but we can-
pot afford the money to do it by force.” Or
it can say to Britain: “We will co-operate
with the R.N. to whatever extent your ex-
perts decide to be necessary, to the limit
of our powers, as we did in France and
Palestine.” There is no doubt as to which
of the two lines a business-like people will
follow. That being so, the only problem of
any real size which faces the Government is
the best means of rendering our navy as
effective as possible. The fact that it must
fit exactly where required into a fighting
machine which may be, part-British, part-
Capadian, part-Maoriland, part-S. African
and even possibly part-Indian and Malayan,
need not preclude its being as distinctively
Australian as the A.I.F. was. In fact, the
more Australian it is the more efficient it
is likely to become. One of its chief weak-
nesses at present is a lack of suitable young-
sters offering for the lower deck —a result
largely, of the old British system of class
promotion as opposed to promotion by merit.
This could be obviated by an arrangement
giving the brilliant boy of the Tingira class
the same early opportunities as the boy of
the Jervis Bay class. Another dangerous
feature of the Ii.A.N.. as distinguished
from the R.N., is its tendency to lose lower-
deck ratings after they have done their first
iseven years at sea: in other words, after
they have ceased to be apprentices and have
become skilled tradesmen. One answer to
it may be the substitution of pensions as in
the R.N. for our equally-costly deferred-pay
system. Under the pension system a boy
engages for 12 years from the age of 18. If
he decides to go out at 30 he does it with
frothing; if he re-engages for another 10
years he acquires the right to a sizeable
annuity. The effect usually is to get a
type of man who has made up his mind to be
a sailor till his working days are over. The
more efficient personnel Australia is able to
throw into the common defence pool, by these
and other devices, the better for its credit
as a nation and for the cause of peace; but,
anyhow, it will have to provide or pay for its
share of the material in the form of ships
and guns. It is growing clearer every day
that the only people who are really enthusi-
astic about the League of Nations scheme
are those without the will or the capacity to
look after themselves.
THE SIMILARITY OF BILL AND
JACK.
With the N. S. Wales State election close
at hand William Holman and John
Storey, Premier and possible Premier, have
read the signs and portents of the Federal
poll and each has drawn great comfort
therefrom.. Bill sees in the stars that the
community is sick of Jack, and Jack sees
in the same medium that it is tired of Bill.
Each regards this alleged fact as proof that
.he 'is himself in great" demand, and neither
makes allowance for the chance that N. S.
Wales may be growing dead-weary of them
both. They are agreed on one point and one
only—that one at least of them is indis-
pensable. As a matter of fact, they are twins
or duplicates. They are spenders pure and
simple, and neither has an idea worth men-
tioning—not even a bad idea that isn t
based on large expenditure. Holman began
his official life as deputy-leader, or virtual
leader, of a professedly anti-borrowing Gov-
ernment. Being beguiled into an easy
downhill by-track, or having taken it with-
out any need for beguilement, he and his
alleged "opponents are now exponents of the
same policy, each claiming to expound it
more furiously than the other and to be the
registered and authorised expounder. Bill
is a pale reflex of what Jack says he will be
if he gets Bill’s place, and Jack says that
Bill doesn t shine with sufficient phospho-
rescence—that being the radiance which de-
cayed fish gives off after dark —and that his
dimness is lamentable. The difference is
that between a man who is in office and lias
to find at least some of the money he
promises and one who, being out of office,
has merely to say how much more he would
easily find if he had the chance. On the
pretence that the State requires two parties
and only two in order to ensure good gov-
ernment they keep nominally apart and pre-
tend to be two, so that they may fill the bill
between them. But in reality Bill and
Jack are one.
• * * *
There are three questions to be put to the
pair of political shams who profess to be
between them the whole possible Government
of the Ma State —three questions that the
pair never face, though they constitute the
entire problem of the hour: —
Does Bill (or Jack) contemplate a formal repudi-
ation of the State debt, in whole or in part?
On the other hand, does Jack (or Bill) look for-
ward to a time when N. S. Wales will simply glide
imperceptibly into liquidation or composition—
just find one morning that the money for the interest
bill is unavailable, and he greatly astonished thereat,
and wonder how it happened, and say the thing is
wholly incomprehensible ?
Or is there a sort of idea that when affairs become
hopeless with the States, the Commonwealth, which
is the States in a different capacity and no more sol-
vent than the States that compose it, will take over
the burdens and do the insolvency or composition or
liquidation itself —in other words, that a new man-
ager will be appointed who will report that the old
managers left the books in shocking disorder but
that he personally isn’t accountable ? It may be
remembered that the complete deficit and disorganisa-
tion of some reconstructed institutions of the 1893
days only came to light when a new manager was
appointed, and his look of pained surprise at the
results left behind by the old predecessor was memor-
able. So were his revelations. Even when the new
fellow had been the old fellow’s deputy all the time
while the trouble was piling up, he was surprised
just the same.
It may be suggested, of course, that the two
personages who regard themselves as the
only possible rulers of the State have never
thought anything at all about the matter. It
may be; but the idea looks like a gross
aspersion on a pair of allegedly intelligent
citizens. Possibly a man may reach the
age of 97} without remembering even once
that he must die some day, but it isn’t
likely. Possibly a man may step gaily over
the rim of a precipice and be half-way down
before it dawns on him even faintly that
he must hit something at the bottom, yet it
doesn’t look probable. The man of 97} may
excuse his remissness by saying he never
died before, and the man half-way down may
plead that he never struck bottom before.
And the politician who sees the burden of
unproductive debt per inhabitant growing
bigger every year, and yet proposes to accel-
erate the pace, can allege that the liability
never grew too big to be handled before. But
ordinary people will refuse to believe that
William and John haven’t seen one or all
of the three unpleasant possibilities ahead of
them, and ordinary people would much like
to know wffiat they said to themselves when
they d’d so.
• • • •
John Storey stands for a party which
once, at its great all-Australian Conference,
considered the question of repudiation, and
didn’t scout or reject it. The attitude was
that the Labor Conference, then at the top-
most pinnacle of pride, was rather favorably
impressed, yet just a little uncertain, for it
referred the matter to a Federal Parliament-
ary Committee for consideration. Events
happened which damped its confidence and
the matter remains in suspense. John
Storey himself, never having been entrusted
with a portfolio, has no official record of
his own on the subject. Holman’s position
is this: he has got so far as to propose
charging a mass of wholly unproductive
road repairs to loans simply because he
hasn’t, or doesn’t trouble to find, the revenue.
His Railway Commissioners have broken the
news, or their legal representative has, that
they may find it necessary or advisable to
charge part of the increased railway and
tramway wages to loans. This view of the
case is supported by the fact that,
according to the Commissioners themselves,
the increased wages and other charges this
year are expected to equal £2.509,198, while
the increased fares and freights are ex-
pected to yield £852,000. leaving a balance
of £1,657,198 of, working expenses to be
made good, and loans seem the only means
of doing it. And that is for one year only.
Then Holman’s Minister of Education is
always talking feelingly about the impos-
sibility of building the two or three millions’
worth of new schools he requires except with
the aid of loans. Thus the talk of filling
up revenue with loans becomes almost a
matter of course. The latest general loan
nroposal deals with the borrowing of
£13,000,000 in one gigantic act. Money
costs nearly twice as much as it once did.
Owing to the increased wages and cost of
materials it produces only about half as
much as it once did. And Holman’s rail-
ways are now stretching out into the places
where no customer lives and even rabbits
live hard, so they pay much less than they
once did. Loan expenditure now is almost
entirely (1) for works that don’t pay; (2)
for works that aren’t expected to pay; and
(3) to fill holes in revenue which aren’t
works at all. The old “permanent and re-
productive” pretence is out of date. It is
now almost undisguisedly a matter of keep-
ing the boom alive, or finding employment
for electors or dodging the bailiff.
Seeing that Storey’s policy is only Hol-
man’s policy in larger and madder type, it
is up to these persons to explain Avhether
they deliberately look ahead to public in-
solvency or Avhether they don’t look ahead
at all. For if the present methods are to
continue, and these two men don’t profess
to have any other methods or to Avant am
others, there is nothing in front but insol-
vency. No doubt they will say that they
have full confidence in the great natural re-
sources and recuperative power of the State,
and that they Avouldn’t insult Ma by sug-
gesting that she can possibly fail to meet
her obligations, but generalities of that
sort don’t count. The time has come for
details.
THE PARTITION OF IRELAND.
The Englishman is a failure as a ruler of
alien and forcibly-attached white races—
and men who are not English are just the
same or worse. The peaceful assimilation of
Scotland is no evidence to the contrary, for
the Scot who was assimilated is mostly Saxon-
Norman like the Englishman, only one
speaks with a burr and the other Avith a
lost aspirate. Also Scotland was not con-
quered ; rather it was flattered by its royal
family being allowed to take England. The
Highland alien, on the other hand, fought
his Saxon-Norman ruler at Edinburgh all
his days, and then fought three wars against
the joint kingdom, and after that he largely
emigrated.
Yvhen the nation that it is sought to assi-
milate differs from the assimilator in religion
as well as in language, descent, traditions,
habits, • clothes, literature, liquor, ambitions
and method of wearing his whiskers, the pro-
cess of digestion is made vastly more diffi-
cult, and if the eater tries to impose his faith
on the meal, or puts the creed of the meal
under special disabilities, he establishes a
vendetta Avhich is likely to last long after
the original cause is dead. Nobody expected
the Catholic Belgian and the largely-Calvin-
ist Dutchman to get on together; nor the
Mohammedan Turk and his Orthodox Greek
subjects to agree even once in a thousand
years. The Catholic Pole, when his country
was dismembered, got along badly with the
Orthodox Greek Russian, and horribly wit!:
the Lutheran Prussian, but —religion being
almost as strong as nationalism—he muddled
along very unobtrusively with his felloAv-
religionist of Austria. Yet even religious
agreement isn’t sufficient to assimilate two
separate peoples. Norway and Sweden are
both Lutheran. Norway in the union days
had the most complete system of Plome Rule,
and the tAVo races, though different, were far
more closely related than the Saxon English
and the Celtic Irish. Yet nobody in England
or elsewhere was surprised when Norway
declared for separation, and when Sweden
took a referendum of the people and found
the vote hostile it was regarded as quite au
ordinary sort of thing that it should give
Nonvay its blessing (or its muffled curse)
and let it slide. Nonvay’s land frontier
marches with that of Sweden, and the “stra-
tegic” reasons why Pharaoh of Stockholm
should not have let his people go were much
greater than in Ireland’s case.
Ever since the disastrous settlement of
Europe after the fall of Napoleon there has
been an impression in civilised lands that it
is bad manners for one white race to annex
or retain another by force. The fact that the
German and the Austrian both did it only
deepened the impression. In Poland, Hungary.
Armenia and Schleswig enlightened com-
munities at least gave their moral support to
the ideas of nationalism and self-determi-
uation. In the cases of Serbia and Monte-
negro, which won liberty with their own
swords, they gladly recognised the liberated
countries. They did the same with Norway,
which won out by bloodless referendum. In
the cases of Greece, Bulgaria, Rumania, Bel-
gium, Lombardy and Venice, big nations
fought that little ones might be free. Even
Russia had the redeeming quality that it
bore a hand. The late war has turned every
little chained-up white European nation
loose, or as loose as possible with the means
at command, barring Ireland.
So Ireland stands out as the Anomaly of
the World. A Home Rule Bill was passed
in 1914, the House of Lords as usual not.
assenting; but under the new Act of 1911
the assent of the Lords can be dispensed Avith.
The law never came into iorce. and it wouldn’t
have made much difference if it had, for it
was neither union nor severance, nor was it
autonomy as Australia, Maoriiand, Canada,
Newfoundland or South Africa know it. Ire-
land was not to control its tariff, so that it
couldn’t build up any industries; and it.
was to have neither army nor navy. Further.
Ireland was to remain attached to Britain in
the old way, only with 42 members in the
Commons instead of 103, so that it would
have less than half its old control over the
big things that concerned it. That was the
law that never came into force. The new
one noAV proposed in a tentative sort of way
is based on the Partition of Ireland, which
the bulk of the people object to just as
another people objected to the Partition of
Poland. It is suggested that there should
be two Irish Parliaments, one for the three
almost Avholly Catholic Provinces of Lein-
ster, Munster and Connaught, and one for
the nine counties and the two cities of
Ulster, where the • Presbyterian and old
Scotch element hangs out. Of the Ulster
counties Tyrone is 511 per cent. Catholic;
Fermanagh, 561; Monaghan, 741 per cent;
Donegal, 79 per cent.; and Cavan, 81 per
cent., which leaves four mainly Protestant
counties, whereof Armagh is just a shade
more than half Protestant. Of the two cities
Belfast is 76 per cent. Protestant, while
Londonderry is 561 per cent. Catholic. So
if Ulster is made a separate State, and if
there is any danger of religious war, it will
merely be an Ulster civil war instead of an
Irish one. It is proposed that there shou'd
be also a federal council entrusted with such
powers as the two Partitioned Parliaments
like to give it. But as the British Parlia-
ment is to control the tariff, shipping, cables,
wireless telegraphs, trade-marks, lighthouses!
army, navy, coinage and trials for treason,
the Partitioned Legislatures would have few 7
poAvers to delegate to the common cguncil.
And as it is proposed that the island should
have 42 instead of 103 members in the
British Commons its influence over the big
things of its own life would be down to
vanishing point.
The proposals, or any proposals like them,
are not in the least degree likely to give sat-


isi'action. Negotiations split on the ques-
tion whether the 590,580 Protestants in
Ulster, or that portion of them who are
descended from the people who moved into
the country with hostile intent and have
remained hostile ever since, should cause the
Partition of Ireland now that partitioning is
out of date. Or whether, if the matter can't
be otherwise settled, the movers-in should
move out again with compensation now that
the Great War has accustomed the world to
the moving business. In reality it is only
the Presbyterian and part of the Noncon-
formist element which is the bone of con-
tention, and that element is not much over
400,000 strong. The 171,199 Protestants of
Leinster, who are mostly of the Anglican
persuasion and don’t sing “Boyne Water,”
seem to get on quietly enough, and the sect
even supplies leaders like Parnell to the
cause of Home Rule.
Accox-ding to the recent cables Lloyd
George and Bonar Law started to expound
the billion-and-a-halfth new policy for the
settlement of Ireland with the statement
that “self-determination” cannot be allowed.
Seeing that self-determination is the fashion
nowadays and is said to be a great principle
and is being allowed in many places, this
seemed rather unlucky. The method was
applauded in Norway and was a cardinal
principle in Italy, and is being used in Poland
and Serbia. It is also stated that Ireland,
the land which is on the road to nowhei’e
except Amei-ica, and which has never once
proved a useful stepping-stone for the in-
vasion of Britain, must be retained for
“strategic reasons,” but as it is a weak coun-
try without iron and coal to make guns
with, and more remote than France whence
most of the big invasions came (the rest
came mostly from Scandinavia), the explana-
tion appears weak.
It is also said that Britain can’t give
way to intimidation, which is reasonable
enough. The misfortune is that it and other
countries hardly ever give way to anything
else. Canada only got its Constitution by two
rebellions, and other dependencies got theirs
because Canada had rebelled and set the ball
l’olling. Scotland, which long after the union
of the crowns was shut out from all trade
with the British colonies, they being called
exclusively “English,” threatened a real
healthy war in Queen Anne’s day and got
what it wanted. The autonomous local Pai’-
liament, such as it was, which for a few
years Ireland enjoyed—if anvone could
enjoy that kind of Parliament—was secured
partly at least by threatening rebellion when
England had its hands full of trouble else-
where, and it was Ulster that threatened
most. Even English women only secured a
vote after smashing property for many years,
and the well-born dames who threw rocks
into windows were not much more careful
as to whether they landed on somebody’s
ear with fatal effect than a Sinn Feiner with
a misdirected gun.
If Britain won’t yield to violence and
won’t yield to anything else; if self-deter-
mination is a virtue in Norway and Poland
but. a vice in Ireland; and if Britain can’t
live within 25 miles of independent Ireland
“for strategic reasons” while it can live
within the same distance of France and with-
in half an inch of the United States, the
position is complicated.
There remains the fact that Ireland is
wonderfully prosperous and ought therefore
to be contented. It seems reasonable, but
somehow man isn’t built that way. Norway
had boomed so wonderfully as a Home Ruled
section of Scandinavia that the little country
owned more than a quarter of the shipping of
continental Europe, yet it handed in its
resignation. And whatever might be other-
wise wrong with Russian rule in Poland it
made the country richer than it ever was
before. No doubt Catholic Ireland made
what save for the chapter of accidents would
have been the blunder or the crime of the
ages when it refused to join heart and soul
in the light against the common gorilla at
Berlin, for had the Hun succeeded its latter
state would have been 10 times worse than
the first. But there wasn’t much in the
Home Rule Act of 1914 to arouse enthusiasm
and the Englishman says the Celt was born
illoeical

PIAIN FNCITTSH.
The Real South Sea Rubble.
It was a wonderful Christmas for money-
- spending. Despite drought losses and strike
losses and repatriation expenses the com-
munity wallowed and bought imported goods
regardless of prices. They bought imported
goods more even than usual, because, by rea-
son of strikes, shortened hours and a general
slowing down, there are fewer Australian
articles to buy. If the loan and paper-
boom could be accelerated, there would soon
be even less Australian articles to buy. The
size of the paper-boom without any further
help can be fairly well gauged by the amount
of money in the banks; there is a great deal
more than twice as much as there was in.
say, 1910. It is a very different kind, of
course. The money in 1910 was the sort
that was good all over the world, but two-
thirds of that which exists now is the kind
which a beggar in Maoriland or China
wouldn’t look at, for it is no good outside
the Commonwealth, and if the Government
goes broke through too much loan-monger-
ing and too much Ryanism it will be prac-
tically no good inside either. Still it is good
'enough to go shopping with —better than the
Inotes of a memorable Sydney bank of the
early 1890’s which consisted of a man and
his brother and a shop in King-street. Then
there are hundreds of millions more Gov-
iernment securities to go shopping with than in
fl9lo, for the War Loans floated here didn’t
'go out of the country to help any war. The
v money being subscribed in paper notes, which
are of no use to a pauper anywhere beyond
ithese shores, the War Loans could no more
leave than Mount Kosciusko could. The
if securities remained in the country, and the
; money paid for them remained in the country,
Iso there was twice as much fluff in the coun-
ftry. No one could actually go shopping with
linscribed stock, but bonds payable to bearer,
| with a lot of little Government cheques for
Pthe half-yearly interest attached, are the
handiest things imaginable with which to
buy Japanese silk stockings at 21s. per pair.
The cheoue for the first half-year’s interest
on the Peace Loan was made bigger than
the actual amount due, and made payable
before it was really due, so that the holders
of Peace Bonds might have the money to
buy foreign goods with at Christmas. And
the holder of a bond had attached to it all
the Government’s half-yearly post-dated
cheques up to 1927, which enterprising
people with imported silk stockings to sell
at 21s. per pair might take at the usual dis-
count. Of course, such small things as £lO
bonds and £1 certificates were currency in
themselves, and might be classed as notes
for shopping purposes. With all this wealth
dropping from Heaven there has been an in-
creasing impression that work is superflu-
ous. So, as already mentioned, there weren’t
many Australian goods to buy. And the
price of imported stuff was outrageous, be-
cause, for one reason, complicated and expen-
sive arrangements have to be made with
foreign bankers before they will find the
hard money to pay the foreign profiteer for
the silk stockings. At present, by the laby-
rinthine processes of '‘exchange,” it is a
case of buying with 20s. or 275. worth of
our depreciated paper promises one sovereign
with which to satisfy the foreigner who is
willing after deep thought to sell for 21s. a
pair of hose that cost him 3s. 6d. This
ought to lead to local production. But Aus-
tralia never learned to manufacture, partlv
because it has never had much of a tariff
and partly because borrowing and loafing on
loan works was easier, and partly because
there aren’t enough hours in the day for
the pursuit of a new industry after we
deduct the hours in which the union bosses
say a free man must not work no matter
at what wages. So it was a wonderful
Christmas—a wonderful Christmas spent on
the real Sea Bubble.
Why the Engine-rooms are Deserted.
“Dandy Funk”: Concerning the present
difficulty with the marine engineers, it is
astonishing how little the general public
knows, and consequently what scantv sym-
pathy it hands out to the men involved. Also
how reluctant the daily press is to air the
real cause of the trouble. To qualify for
a marine engineer a man has first of all
to pay a stiff premium, usually about £2OO,
and serve an apprenticeship of from five to
six years in a workshop ashore for a wage
which does not pay for the clothes he ruins.
At the end of his apprenticeship he has to
serve as junior on board a vessel for 18
months before he can qualify • for his first
certificate; then, after an arduous examina-
tion, and supposing he succeeds in passing,
he has to return to sea for another 18 mbnths
before he is qualified to attempt his second
exam. If again successful, and after wait-
ing his seniority turn, he reaches the exalted
position of chief engineer at a screw a shade
higher than he pays his donkeyman or.
greaser. Ships’ officers, who will probably
be the next to hold the floor, are in the
same fix. They, too, have to serve a four-
year apprenticeship with no remuneration
worth mentioning, and have as well three
costly examinations to pass before attaining
even the rank of master. On the Australian
coast they must also pass an exam, at every
port to obtain a pilotage exemption cer-
tificate before being appointed to a com-
mand. These latter certificates, paid for
out of the men’s own pockets, save the ship-
owners thousands of pounds every year; but
none of the money finds its way to the ship-
master’s pocket. In most cases he is not
even refunded his exam. fee. And after
wading through all this worry and expense
his salary just exceeds that of some of his
deckhands. A month before the outbreak of
war the masters and officers were granted an
award by Justice Higgins which operated
through the disastrous years of war and the
ever-increasing cost of living. This award
expired in June last, but owing to the wharf-
laborers, miners, seamen or firemen, etc.,
making demands and downing tools until
they were granted, the Merchant Service
Guild has been unable to get a judicial hear-
ing so far. There is no hope of getting it
before next March, and little hope of any
satisfaction then if, as the president of the
Arbitration Court says, he can only base his
award on the cost of living. At the present
moment lying idle in Sydney harbor are half
a dozen naval craft presented to us by the
Imperial Government (and more to follow)
to help us form our own navy; but it seems
that we are unable to man them. Is it any
wonder? Even if the sailors were forth-
coming what Australians are going to send
their sons to a long and arduous training
as officers with conditions at sea as they are?
♦
The Meat Trust.
The New York Times, announced last mofith
that the American Meat Trust (the Armour,
Morris, Swift, Wilson and Cudahy pack-
ing companies) had “consented to sell all
their holdings in public stockyards, railroads,
stock market, newspapers, public cold stor-
age and warehouses, and to forever dissoci-
ate themselves with the retail meat business
and the wholesale groceries canning busi-
ness,” and had “made arrangements for the
dissolution of their meat-packing business in
Australia and South America.’’ It is about
seven years since the “Big Five” started
business in Australia. Their aim was not
so much to send up meat prices in the Com-
monwealth, though that of course did hap-
pen, as to get control of the far more import-
ant London market. They could never hope
to fix the price of meat for England in Lon-
don, as they had done for so long in Chicago
for America, with a meat-exporting country
of the importance of Australia free. In
consequence Mr. Milkow, of SwtfTs,
arrived in Queensland, commissioned by a
mysterious company (consisting chiefly of
seven young Brisbane law-clerks) to spend
£1,750,000 on a meatworks, etc., on the banks
of the Brisbane River and elsewhere. About
the same time the Union Cold Storage Co.
spent several hundred thousand pounds on
stations in Queensland and the Northern
Territory and started the Darwin freezing
works. The Bulletin remarked that it all
smelt like the great U.S. octopus. Conserva-
tives and the Conservative press said that
the suggestion was outrageous. The price
of meat began suddenly to rise, not only in
Queensland, but also in S. Australia, whose
meat comes largely from Queensland; in
N. S. Wales, which gets over half its meat
from the Northern State; and elsewhere.
The Tories still scoffed at the notion that.
the Meat Trust was responsible. They argued
that there was “a legitimate shortage.”
But by 1914 the public had ceased to be
satisfied on the subject. In June of that
year Justice Street, of N. S. Wales, sitting
as a Federal Royal Commissioner, inquired
into the whole business. The evidence left
no one in any doubt as to the facts. The
Tories then changed their line of argument.
They said that if the Trust was in Aus-
tralia, as alleged, a simple method of deal-
ing with it existed. There was no need
for any Constitutional amendments: the
Government could defeat it by stopping ex-
ports. This suggestion, which would have
meant the ruin of thousands of producers all
over Australia had it been followed, was
advanced by F. B. S. Falkiner, the present-
day Farmers’ Friend, amongst others. Of
course the scheme was never attempted, and
the big Trust remained immune. Although
its activities were prejudicing the whole of
Australia, there was only one power in the
Commonwealth equipped to attack it, namely
the Queensland State Government; and it
had no desire to do so. For Bananaland was
doing very well out of its imported octopus.
So nothing was done; and that Australia is
to be freed of the great exploiter now is
merely due to a combination of chances, the
chief of which is perhaps that the predatory
Trust over-reached itself. In July last the
IJ.S. Federal Trade Commission reported to
President Wilson that the Big Five not
only had “international control of meat pro-
ducts” but would shortly control “all im-
portant foodstuffs in the United States.”
They already handled “half the poultry,
eggs and cheese in inter-State commerce,”
and it was their object to dominate the sup-
ply of all meat substitutes so that “the con-
sumer would have nothing to gain by turn-
ing to them for relief from the excessive
meat prices.” Wilson is a Democrat, and
therefore one of the traditional enemies of
the Trusts which have paid so many millions
of dollars to the funds of the Republicans.
The post-war mood of the U.S. workers is
dangerous. In law the position of the Meat
Trust is as unassailable as ever it was. But
in all the circumstances the Big Five were
no doubt wise to dissolve. They can resume
when the present storm has blovtrn over.
Work.
This is The Bulletin’s industrial creed in
two sentences:—
(1) We believe in hard work with all our heart
and soul.
(2) Damn hard work if it is only hard work!
To get an illustration go to Sydney Tele-
graph’s financial column, the subject being
the hard condition of Britain, which now
owes the United States at least twelve hun-
dred millions for war expenses and is being
charged 6 per cent, or a little more on the
amount: —
In the meantime it is essential that the Empire
should not buy in America more than she can pay
for in exports to America, and so prevent that
debt increasing. As for economics, it seems useless
to preach them; but the gospel of Production
and Hard Work may in time make way because it
is essential to a recovery.
It certainly is essential that “the Empire
should not buy in America more than she
can pay for in exports to America,” It is
even essential that she should buy in
America a great deal less than she can pay
for in exports to America. For Britain not
only doesn’t want to increase its debt of
twelve hundred millions to the Cormorant
of Liberty; it urgently requires to reduce
the debt. For the Cormorant flatly refuses to
make it a debt for a fixed term at a fixed
rate. The liability is being renewed by bits
at odd times as the bits fall due, and there
is no evidence that 10 per cent, may not be
demanded if J. Bull is sufficiently hard
pressed. Australia doesn’t ljpow how much
of its debt the United States hold, for J.
Bull has been driven to sell securities
wholesale; but it does know that if Uncle
Sam puts up his rate to J. Bull to 8 per
cent., J. Bull’s rate to us when our loans
fall due, which they are doing every year, is
likely to be nine. He certainly won’t borrow
at 8 per cent, to lend to us at 6 and make a
big loss. So what is a good rule for Britain to
follow with regard to the U.S.A. is a better
rule for us to follow with regard to Britain.
Hard work —that is the only way of escape
for either of us. But it must be sane as well
as hard work. If the work consists of hump-
ing foreign bales off a foreign profiteer’s
ship, and dumping on it greasy wool which
we should at least scour ourselves, and State-
subsidised wheat which we should at least
grind ourselves —well, hard work of that
sort is mere stupidity whether it is done in
Australia or Britain. Hard work is essen-
tial ; but hard pick-and-shovel work or tough
hod-carrying never bought anybody a palace,
nor did any hard-labor prisoner ever buy the
gaol out of his treadmill earnings.
The Cable as a Creator of Racial
Hatred.
Another preposterous Irish yarn was
starred in Australia last week :—.
An armed party of 12 attacked the Vice-Regal
Lodge at Dublin. The officer of the guard and one
of the attackers were killed. Four arrests have been
made.
The attack took the form of half an hour’s scat-
tered daylight sniping at the Vice-Regal Lodge from
the distance of a quarter of a mile.
It was stated, in amplification:—
(1) The attackers “sniped rapidly at the soldiers,
who deployed as though in battle.”
(2) The dead sniper was in uniform.
(3) The military party “suddenly came face to face
with a gang of men, and both parties fired, only the
width of a road separating them ; and the soldiers
continued firing until the attackers were dispersed,
leaving the dead body of a comrade, in which six
bullets were lodged.”
An inquest was held, and the facts then came
to hand. There was no “armed party of 12”:
'there was only one man, and he was “harm-
less and unarmed.” Also, “perhaps intoxi-
cated.” He was one of the Vice-Regal Lodge
gardeners. The soldiers accidentally shot
their officer, as was indicated by the bullets
found in his chest. They were “excited.”
The gardener was not in unifonn. The
‘“hhlf an" hour’s scattered daylight sniping at
the Vice-Rpgal Lodge” was mythical:'the.fusil-
lade of the soldiers was delivered ar one
o’clock in the morning. The raising of a -
counter-cry is one of the oldest tricks known
to politics; and the present press cam-
paign which aims at diverting the world’s
mind from the new Home Rule Bill, or any
Home.. Rule Bill,and.towards the view that.
Ireland is seething with assassination and
Sinn Fein, is a sample of it. Every lunatic
or drunk who lets a gun off is “an armed
band of Sinn Feiners in uniform.” Occa-
sionally, as in last week’s case, he doesn’t
even require to be in possession of a weapon.
He is slaughtered by a raw and jumpy
patrol; labelled' “Sinn Feiners Again” or
something similar; and the papers give the
episode such headings as these, which
appeared in Sydney Sun (29/12/’l9) :
AFTER LORD FRENCH.
Sinn Feiners’ Attack.
Sniping at Vice-Regal Lodge.
Daylight Raid by an Ahmed Party.
Ireland is naturally dissatisfied with mili-
tary rule. Every country that gets it is.
The same applies to.any sort of alien domina-
tion, however wise and benevolent, self-gov-
ernment being traditionally preferable to
good government. If but 10 per cent, of the
gun-running tales which have been told in
the past five years were based on fact, Ireland
is stiff with lethal weapons. Deeds of vio-
lence are among the aftermath of all great
wars. Thus a London cable message, sent
on the same day as the nonsense about the
“armed party of 12,” remarked: —
Magistrates and the police are commenting on the
continued prevalence of capital crimes in England.
Yet with it all the worst that Ireland can
do in the way of sensational lawlessness is
represented by rows which would not get a
four-line paragraph if they happened any-
where else. Such malicious lies ought to
be dealt with by a Pure News Act, a mea-
sure which has been needed for years.
“Till After the Elections.”
N. S. Wales has had a Venereal Disease
Act on its Statute Book for many months.
The Government postponed making it opera-
tive last winter —allegedly because of the
influenza outbreak and the resulting rush on
the hospitals and the doctors —and it was
finally determined that it should start as
from January 1, 1920. Now it has received
a further setback till next March. It is
not believed to be good party business to
make a serious attack on venereal disease.
The reason is the identical one which should
inspire a Government to take action—an
enormous number of people of all ranks and
classes suffer from it. It is, in the old
phrase, a Secret Disease, and those afflicted
notoriously resent the efforts of Governments
to cure them, and incidentally save their
friends and relations from infection. It is
safe to say, therefore, that no effort will be
made in N. S. Wales to cope with V.D. till
after the coming State elections. The just-
published annual report of the Vic. Inspec-
tor-General of Insane is eloquent of the tac-
tical wisdom of delay. All cases of General
Paralysis of the Insane are due to syphilis,
and three per cent, of all syphilitics get
G.P.I. In Victoria an average of 78 G.P.I.
patients are received into the hospitals every
year. They probably represent all the cases
for the State, G.P.I. being a form of mad-
ness which is much too definite to be con-
cealed by the relatives of the victim. Dr.
Lind, of the pathological laboratory, con-
cludes accordingly that there are as nearly
as possible 26W fresh cases of syphilis in
Victoria every year. ajtSo that even if Vic-
toria started, say, 30 years ago with an
entirely clean bill of health, venereally speak-
ing—which, of course, it did not —yet one
person in every 50 would be syphilitic. And
the so-called “minor scourge” is anything
from seven to 10 times commoner than
syphilis in Australia. Nor is Victoria either
worse or better off in this respect than any
other white man’s section of the world where
anti-V.D. measurgs have either only recently
been initiated or not been tried at all.
N. S. Wales Ministers know that syphilis is
“rampant” in their State, as, on the autho-
rity of Dr. Lind, it is in Victoria, and that
for every day they put off the ’ busi-
ness of grappling with it thousands of yet
unborn will live lives of shame and misery.
Politics apart, they have every incentive to
move. The medical profession is ready and
eager to start: “the general practitioner,”
according to the Medical Journal of Aus-
tralia (20/9/T9), “once persuaded of the
possibility of reducing venereal infections,
would throw himself heart and soul into the
work.” The public—certainly the non-
diseased portion, and probably most of those
who have at some time suffered—is in a
frame of mind to approve drastic measures.
There is only one lion in the path, and the
name of the unclean animal is the V.D. vote.
It is one of the most horrible examples imag-
inable of the callously unpatriotic way in
which the Party Government system is liable
to function.

The Duke of Plaza Toro, Limited.
The half-year’s accounts in Queensland
explain why Premier Theodore shut up
Parliament with a bang and refused to say
anything about the financial position till the
Federal election was over and his predecessor
Ryan had had his chance for the Prime
Ministership. Ryan’s trump card was the
magnificent prosperity he had left behind him
in his own State. Now the accounts show’
a deficit of £662,558 for the six months:
and as the bill, for interest isn’t scattered
over the year as in other States, but falls
due' to a very great extent between now’
and June, the deficit for the 12 months
may well be over a million and a half. In
that case the £2,000,000 loan which was
Mtely scraped up at £6 ss. or so per cent,
won’t leave much margin for public works
at present prices. The people in England who
advanced the money on the security of “per-
manent and reproductive” undertakings may
not have quite realised yet that the security
is more like the corpse of a dead shortage,
but probably they wouldn’t care much if they
did know, for the negotiators have no inten-
tion of carrying the infant permanently.
They get their solid commission on the trans-
action, in return for which they take up all
the loan that the public doesn’t take and
make it a Great Success. And because it is
a Great Success the public sees that Queens-
land is solvent, and any securities with which
the underwriters may be burdened can thus
be peddled out at a profit to elderly retired
people who want to make the biggest possible
income out of a small capital. No loan has
been a failure since the ideawas devised of
hiring rich Jew’s and. others at heavy expense
'to- be sham' subscribers, and there is no
reason w’hy the last loan of all before the
crash shouldn’t be subscribed twice over by
arrangement, in order to restore confidence
and help the middlemen to clear off their
dead-stock of securities .on the last of-the

market. Before the device, when loans de-
pended on genuine popularity with the public,
failures were disagreeably common, even
though Australia’s security was ranch better
then. N. S. Wales is also on the road to a
£2,000,000 shortage, but a £2,000,000 short-
age in the Ma State is £1 per inhabitant, while
in Queensland it is more like £3 each. Also
the Ma State’s direct State taxation is a
little over £2 per inhabitant while Queens-
land’s is over £4, so in Holman’s case it looks
as if an increase of State taxation to £3 per
head might keep the wolf from the door a
few months longer. On the other hand,
Theodore and Fihelly seem to require
£7. That is apart from Federal taxation.
And the Government is losing the power to
enforce taxes. When it was bidding for office
it taught its followers that an attitude of
coarse familiarity and constant aggravation
and opposition and refusal to obey orders
and work-stopping and blastedness and you-
bedamnedness were inseparable from free-
dom, and that man must be a nark if he isn’t
a worm. Now authority has so slipped from
its hands that the other day it was compelled,
by orders of the union, to refuse a man
board and lodging at the State Hotel and
help in driving the boycotted one out of the
district merely because he bad been the
State’s own witness in a criminal case. It
wasn’t professed that he was a false ■wit-
ness—only a witness. The pretence that the
Kings of Barataria have any power left is
worn pretty thin, and the pretence of pros-
perity also. The apparent idea is that things
will go on somehow as long as possible, and
when they won’t go on they will probably
stop. That much serious and not more
impecunious institution, the Duke of Plaza
Toro, Limited, found himself in the same
position in one of Gilbert’s operas.
Gitas. R. Hodge, Registrar of the University
of Adelaide, appears for the defence: —
The Bulletin of December 18 castigates the
Council of the University of Adelaide in regard to
the recent appointment of Dr. Coleman Piiillipson
as professor of law because he is not an Australian.
Kindly allow the following facts on the other side
to appear for the information of readers, who will
then probably endorse the action of the Council: —
(1) Applications were invited by advertisement in
the Australian States as well as in England.
(2) Fifteen applications were received. The Uni-
versity Council considered the whole of them, and
made the appointment which in its absolute judg-
ment was the best. In so doing it had the advan-
tage of the assistance of an advisory committee
composed of Adelaide lawyers with the exception of
one. '
(3) In addition to the professor there are lec-
turers in practical subjects in the Law School, who
are all selected from the profession in Adelaide.
(4) During the current year the University has
appointed six professors:—Dr. Harold Davies, to
the chair of music : Dr. J. R. Wilton, mathematics;
Dr. Brailsford Robertson, physiology; Dr. J.
Burton Cleland, pathology; Dr. F. Wood-Jokes,
anatomy; and Dr. Coleman Phillipson, law.
The first three are graduates of Adelaide, and Dr.
Cleland, Adelaide born, completed three years of
his medical course here, but, in consequence of the
unfortunate “hospital trouble” in the ’nineties, ho,
with others, went to Sydney, where he graduated.
Of the six men appointed four may be regarded as
graduates of the University, showing the Council’s
■“wisdom of preference for its own graduates.” In
regard to the other appointments, the Council feels
that the University is to be, and shortly will be,
congratulated on having added to its teaching staff
•such distinguished men as Dr. Wood-Jones and Dr.
Phillipson.
Yes, it is not a bad record. Tn most studies
the Council seems to be satisfied that Aus-
tralian Universities can train their own
teachers. Why not also in Law? Is the
teaching there less satisfactory than in the
others? If it is it is singularly unfortunate,
because, whereas Mathematics, for instance,
are the same all the world over, Law is not
the same in any two countries, and it is
therefore particularly desirable that in this
subject our teachers should be home pro-
ducts.
From a man with a lot of experience:—
At every election, whether State or Federal, pre-
siding officers have to deal with many persons who
can scarcely believe that their names are not on the
roll. They saj' they have filled in either a form
or a card at some time or other; hence they should
be entitled to vote. At the recent election a con-
fident-looking man came into one of our booths,
threw a card on the table arid demanded a vote
“under Section 121.” He could not find his name
on the roll, but he was sure his claim had been
lodged, for he had delivered it himself. Then he
pointed to the card to settle all arguments. It
did. That “trump” was the usual notification that
his name had been placed on the State roll. Inci-
dents of this kind must have been plentiful all oA’er
the country. There are thousands who think that
one claim or one notification does for both rolls.
And why shouldn’t it ? Just consider the unfortu-
nate elector Avho, on changing his address, informs
the State Electoral Department, but is unaware
that by omitting to pay the Commonwealth authori-
t’es a similar compliment he is committing a
“crime” ! Is it any wonder he growls about the
“madness” of the law when he is fined 2s. 6d. for
not having his name on the roll, or for having
failed to mention that he had “moved”? And for
their part presiding officers would be saved much
needless trouble if the Federal subdivisions coincided
with the State electorates. The few absent voters
\vhi> do profess to know the electorate for which they
are enrolled, generally confuse the State and the
Commonwealth divisions. To add to this confusion,
voting at a State election (in Queensland, for in-
stance) is compulsory, whereas the Federalites
bc-lieve in the voluntary system. Yet in each case
enrolment is compulsory and non-enrolment a
“crime.”
“Fax” : How much of an Australian public
man’s time is wasted in attendance at empty
ceremonies, at luncheons and dinners where
he doesn’t want to eat anything, at bazaars
where he doesn't want to buy anything,
smoke-nights where he doesn’t smoke any-
thing, and “gatherings” where he is expected
to make a speech with nothing in it? A
typical paragraph in the Melbourne dailies
tells how a physically-weak man who lives
by politics is subjected to needless travelling
and performance of formal foolishness: —
Mr. Hughus will arrive this morning, and imme-
diately after - the Cabinet meeting will proceed to
Bendigo to be present at the declaration of the poll.
The poll had been declared in print for days
before the “official” declaration came to pass,
and the occasion that took Hughes to Ben-
digo was sheer waste of time. But because the
elected member and his opponent usually
turn up at the silly function and make a
few worthless remarks, Billy Hughes was
OTHELLO’S OCCUPATION GONE.
CASUAL DRINKER: “What makes those two blokes so miserable?"

expected to tear off to Bendigo to be formally
told that he was elected and return thanks
for the honor. Why? What possible good
can result from 90 per cent, of the irksome
duties imposed upon a poor little wisp of
manhood in Hughes’s position? Can a
community make any worse use of a Prime
Minister than to send him 80 miles out of
town to be present at the declaration of a
poll? The first Cabinet Minister who pub-
licly protests against the tyranny of cus-
tom will have the sympathy of the public
with him. If all the members of Parliament
conspired to throw off the yoke of foolish
precedent and give to practical work a lot
of the time they now devote to mere fooling
in the limelight, the reform would come quite
easy. But, alas! fooling in the limelight is,
for most of them, an absolutely indispen-
sable means of advertisement.
“Sixo”: I was one of the fool victims of
V.D., and this is my experience. There were
between 40 and 50 cases on the transport by
which I returned, and no proper treatment
was available for the seven weeks’ trip. A
day before reaching our first Aussie port
nearly all of us were discharged from hos-
pital, although in my own case I am assured
that I require at least a further 18 months’
treatment. On arrival in Melbourne we were
given a clean discharge, there being neither
examination nor questions re V.D. I now
find that unless I can visit Melbourne twice
a week I cannot receive further treatment.
I live inland in Victoria, and on arrival
home reported myself to the municipal
authorities, but was told that they had
nothing to do with me. There must be hun-
dreds like myself who would be only too
glad to get rid of this curse, and surely we
are not to blame for hanging on to our
plague, seeing that everybody in authority in
our own country disclaims all interest in
us when we return.
“Goon Australian”: I am dubious about
the effect this new organisation of peasants,
the Farmers’ Union, will have on the
national policy. In political economy these
physiocrats or agriculturists are opposed to
the mercantile system which favors the indus-
tries of cities. The Farmers’ Union natu-
rally believes the earth to be the only source
of national wealth and agriculture to be the
only indispensable industry, and that all
other laborers—mechanics, merchants and
manufacturers —produce nothing to increase
the public wealth. Accordingly the tillers
of the soil and the keepers of sheep desire
perfect freedom of trade, and do not care
a hoot whether the products of a country are
consumed by natives or by foreigners. Such
a policy will not suit Australia, and the pres-
ence of a solid peasants' party in the Federal
Parliament exercising the balance of power
seems to denote a clash with the true national
policy founded upon national interest. In
1785 France was prospering under Protec-
tion when her silk industry was at its zenith,
and by arrangement with England she
adopted Freetrade, allowed England to
swamp her with goods, threw thousands of
mechanics and artisans out of work, caused
stoppage of production, famine, starvation
and misery, and so brought on the F rench lie-
volution. From IS4U onwards Britain
adopted Freetrade ideals at the behest of
Manchester, abandoned Protection, let her
agriculture decay, permitted Germany to
beat her at making iron and steel, and so
brought about the rise of Germany to indus-
trial and political power. Germany became
powerful because Freetrade Britain opened
wide her doors and let in German sugftn tex-
tiles and iron manufactures. Germany had
ft tariff and grew strong; Britain had none
ftnd grew weak. Safety first, then strength
and independence —all three impossible un-
less Australian gets a proper Protective tariff
behind which to create hundreds of new in-
dustries. Will the Farmers’ party help or
hinder this national policy?
“Greentape”: Political precept and prac-
tice do not often tally. In his Mark Antony
oration over dead Caesar at Federal Par-
liament House on Oct. 9, Willie Watt gloried
in the fact that his friend had died plain
Alfred Deakin “when many things might
have come his way.’’ On January 1 the
orator accepted a Privy Councillorship. He
will, therefore, not be quite so plain as
Deakin, or a.s Iliginbotham.
Monash may be called to the bar of botii
Federal Houses in March and thanked for
his military services. As yet the matter has
only been suggested in a whisper. It would
be a fitting honor. Besides British pre-
cedents, there is the instance of Washington
being admitted to “a- public audience’’ of
Congress to “surrender into its hands the
trust committed to him.” Speaker Johnson
will relish telling Monash, as the U.S. Presi-
dent informed Washington, that he had “de-
fended the standard of liberty,” and “retired
with the blessings of his fellow citizens.”
The new Hun republican flag has no
brotherliood-of-man nonsense about it. Other
republics have rung the changes on the tri-
color (which stands for liberty, equality
and fraternity nowadays whatever its begin-
nings might‘be); but the eagle is good
enough for Brother Fritz. The bird is use-
less. as a carrier, a beast of burden or a
pet It is uneatable and a confirmed baby-
eater. It lives for itself alone. and. is arro-
gant beyond ordinary fowl. It flies high.
It smells badly. It never did a day’s honest
work in its life. It isn’t beautiful, and is
often dirty about the feet through standing
on dead victuals. . It has the insatiable nose
of a usurer. The only good thing charged
against it is that it doesn’t eat carrion like
the vulture; and that isn’t a virtue, after all.
It simply means that the vulture cleans up
unwholesome places, while the eagle leaves
places as dirty as it found them, like a
slovenly woman who lets the breakfast dishes
lie about all day. The Hun republican eagle
has also a red beak and red claws, and
that presumably is to be taken as a sign that
the Hun hasn’t changed and doesn’t propose
to.
The cross benches in the House of Reps,
will become a sort of jury box where the 12
good men and true representing Henry Hav-
seed will be addressed by barrister Hughes
on the one side and barrister Ryan on the
other. Sometimes the jury will be locked up
for the night, but the whole Court will sit
up with it and cajole it.
Labor is reaping the fruits of its selfish-
ness during the period when, with a hand-
some majority in the Senate, it could have
introduced the proportional representation
system, anticipating such an election as that
of last month. The majority-representation
plan has pushed Labor out of the Senate,
and some 45 p.c. of the populace now has
no voice worth mentioning in the manage-
ment of its affairs.
Murray Smith emerged from his retirement
for a moment recently to remonstrate gently
with young Worrall (son of the limelit par-
son) on things he was saying that were detri-
mental to “our party” while he (Worrall)
was opposing Willie Watt. The ancient
Heed not have bothered. Worrall only mail*
aged to poll one vote to Willie’s five. Evi=
dently Murray Smith had forgotten his owri
sound advice to Watt some years ago that
the best way to get on as a Minister is tb
“suffer fools gladly.”
“Timo” • The preferential system of voting
led many electors to declare themselyes illi-
terate and unable to vote without assistance,
consequently abuses crept in. Here is an
instance. An old lady of about 70 declared
to a party scout who approached her outside
the polling-booth that she wished to vote for
Mr. X. “Very well, madam,” said the scout,
who was acting for a rival candidate. J’Come
along and I’ll explain it to you.” He
explained that by placing the figure 2 against
the name of her candidate she would be giv-
ing him two votes, and she was to put the
figure 1 against the name of Mr. Y. (his
candidate). The presiding officer had to do
the marking of the ballot-paper, the old dame
being unable to make a figure. After mark-
ing it to her instruction he handed it back
to her. “If I had 100 votes I'd give ’em.
all but one to Mr. X.,” she said triumphantly
as she put the paper in the box.
“Six and Eight”: Well-known pests of
the ’nineties were canvassers who by mis-
representation got people to sign book-
contracts without reading them. Their
operations became such a scandal that the
N. S. Wales Parliament, at the instance of
W. P. Crick, passed the Rook Purchasers’
Protection Act. An Industrial Arbitration
Court report suggests that a similar act for
the protection of Judges is necessary. “This
is the most dreadful award I have ever
seen !” exclaimed Judge Curlewis as lie read
the Coachmakers’ award : and when his sig-
nature at the tail of it was pointed out to
him he made the extraordinary confession,
“I don’t suppose I could have read it! ’ If
Paddy Crick’s Act was justified by the asser-
tions of book purchasers that, relying ou
canvassers’ misrepresentations, they had
signed contracts unread, similar averments
bv Judges might perhaps justify their pro-
tection by like legislation.
The Halfpenny brothers, of Tibooburra
(N.S.W.), are worth a million more than
their name. Recently Jack and Jim of the
clan left their remote township on bikes fol*
Boulia (Q.) intending to make the journey
via Berawinna station and Ilungerford.
Owing to the drought the country they were
to traverse is just a desert now. In the first
two days they did 85 miles. The third day
out they expected to find water at Conulpie
and then make Thurlow Downs, but on arri-
val at Canulpie no liquid was available.
Exhausted by thirst and heat (114 deg. in
the shade) they discarded their packs and
pedalled on to Millar’s tank. That, too, was
dry. Scratching failed to reveal a drop.
John began to go under from the effects
of wounds received in the war, and his
younger brother undertook to make Tliur-
low Downs for assistance. Jim had gone
only five miles when he struck a sandstorm
and got lost in it. During the night John
still scratched and obtained A little soakage.
Next day he was still too ill to travel un-
aided. but awaited the arrival of the party
from the Downs. The following morning he
came to the conclusion that something had
gone wrong, and decided to crawl on to
Thurlow. That took two days. Then, safe him-
self, he had the poor consolation of learn-
ing that his brother had not turned up. All
hands were immediately mustered. After the
adjacent desert had been scoured for 11
hours. Jim was discovered wandering in the
sandhills stark naked, delirious and his
tongue so swollen that he could not swallow
water. He was taken to Berawinna station.
Then the real Australian thing happened:
after a few days’ rest the pair unconcernedly
resumed the track. Scores of things like
that which have happened in the drought-
stricken areas during the oast few months
explain Gallipoli and St. Quentin.


OPINION.
“The Manufacture of pig-iron and steel in
Australia would mean that practically the
total cost of the same would be spent in
Australia, as the whole of the ores, coal, lime-
stone, etc., would be mined here, and all
the money required for wages, salaries and
various expenses would be distributed in the
Commonwealth. Few industries give such
opportunities in this direction and none to
such an extent.”
From the majority report of The Interstate Commission dealing with
The Australian Iron and Steel Industry
If all the iron and steel imported into Australia were made by our own people
work at Australian rates of pay would be given to not less than
30,000 MEN
who could
earn over
£5.000,000 per year.

POLITICAL
POINTS
If you happen to owe £2 to a man in the
United States —and we import so much
Yankee goods that everybody owes that much
annually to a man in the United States—
you just send him £2 9.5. fid. and the busi-
ness is closed. The article cost £2, and fool-
ish people said it was cheaper than some-
thing local at £2 55., but “exchange”—that
mysterious loot which a creditor nation with
a hook nose is always levying on a debtor
nation with a retreating chin—makes the
difference. If the 9s. fid. was permanent
tariff it might promote local industry, but
“exchange,” which is here to-day and 15
bob to-morrow, is a dubious foundation to
build on.
The Sydney unions are occasionally repre-
sented in court by one Croft, who holds that
it is a disgrace for employers to put up the
price of the goods just because wages go
up. The loss should be met out of “large
reserves.” N. S. Wales railway wages have
gone up, and the employer has rushed up

THE TROUBLED MA-BIRD : “I’ve hatched some
queer things in my time, but there’s one

tbe price of the goods—the railway and
tram ticket. And if Croft or any other
Laborite have told how to meet the
case otherwise the employer—who, being
also the customer, has reluctantly put up
prices on himself—would have been dashed
glad to hear the explanation. In fact, he
would have been triply dashed. Yet Croft
and his friends say the matter is quite
simple. Doubtless they will fix it themselves
when John Storey is Premier.
Nothing could be more dishonest than the
pretence of the Labor party that it is one
party, with the same programme; and the
little Socialist crowd which goes to the
polls every time, and is beaten, deserves far
more respect than it gets. The mistake it
makes perhaps is in running three candi-
dates when there are three vacancies, as for
the Senate. Thousands of people who are
Socialists more or less (everybody is a
Socialist more or less) are not content to
throw all their votes to hopeless candidates,
and though they give one vote to a Socialist
that vote is cut up among three, and there-
fore none of the three makes a decent show-
ing. So the real strength of Socialist
opinion is not indicated. You can
get proof of this by noting that Laborites
or the Farmers’ man got. the second prefer-
ences of thousands of people whose No. 1
vote went to a Socialist.
The absurdity of some of the existing
electoral arrangements is demonstrated by
the fact that Garling, the country lawyer
who ran Gardiner hard for third place in
the N. S. Wales Senate poll and lost, for-
feits his deposit. The theory of the deposit
i.-: that it is required in order to keep utterly
hopeless candidates from butting in and over-
crowding the ballot-paper; but with the new
system of preference voting the nominee of
one or other of the' two big parties will
almost certainly lose his deposit in a Senate-
election unless the party slaves are bidden,
to do as the Laborites did —-give one of their
Senate candidates the No. 1 vote in one
district and others of them the Np. 1 vote
in other districts. The N. S. Wales Nation- 1
alist, machine instructed its slaves to vote
(’ox, Duncan, Garling in that alphabetical
.order ; and Garling was pipped by Gardiner
; —who came in just ahead of liiin on . the
paper. If Garling,’s name had been Brown-
lie would probably have been a Senator now.
The Federal Gallery man’s forecast: —
Gregory, M.11.1i.,' is .beaming with thy, prospect
of seeing- himself starred .as. the,.leader of* the Far-
mers’ party. Formerly ojie of the obscure snipers 0/
tlie Ministerial corner, he now awaits an elevation
that gives him visions of Hughes -.or Tudor-R.viin
waiting anxiously on iris doormat for his vote and
influence. Gregory lias already imparted to the lob-
bies that his position is .as analogous to Ned Kelly’s
as the rules of political warfare, allow. . His squad
makes no seerpt of its modest, ambition, that the
third party shall be the first in the land, building
legislation for its aggrandisement.-. It hopes to
achieve great 'results by stressing its- bold on Un-
balance of power, but if Hughes refuses-to buy its
support, tlie Fanners’ party will be politically negli-
gible. The alternative to helping Hughes will be
joining Ryan, with the prospect of facing, angry . con-
stituents with this: awful intrigue to explain, Doubt-
less the Farmers will try the trick of flourishing a
pistol, but they will first take the precaution of see-
ing that it is loaded with blank.
_ The possibility looms, ahead that Aus-
tralia may be left without newspapers
unless it leaves off some
of its til p.c. . loan
works and sets to making
its own paper out of its
own straw. The U.S. and
Canada are now almost
the sole sources of supply,
and the former is so doubt-
ful about the future that
it is limiting the size- of
newspapers and magazines.
After that the export of
paper hill probably he
stopped, just as it is pro-
posed to stop the export
of oil,'- Then, if Canada
can be drawn into some
friendly -arrangement with
Uncle Sam, it won’t be
merely a matter of Aus-
tralia paying £lOO for
paper that cost £25 before
the war, and £l2 per ton
for freight which used to
be £2, but of famine at any
price. Even a threat to
stop sending rabbits and
Trade Commissioners to
the U.S. till the embargo is
lifted may not avail. In
fact, barring some hard
work on our own account,
Australia may have to
revolt from Britain and
become part of the U.S.
so as to get inside the
barrier and have paper to
print the S. M. Herald on.
“The Wanderer” : Periodically a wail goes
up about decentralisation and the curse of
too much Sydney. Let’s pause a moment.
Two papers of the Farmers’ party are
printed in Sydney. Farmers and Settlers’
Conference is held regularly in Sydney.
Primary Producers’ Conference meets in
Sydn'ey. Country Municipal Conference
meets in Sydney. Country Press Confer-
ence meets in Sydney. I often wonder why
these decentralisationists don’t shear their
sheep and thresh their wheat in Sydney.
When it was fjroposed in N. S. Wales Par-
liament that Germans, Austrians, Turks and
Bulgarians should be disfranchised in a
municipal sense, the usual Hun sympathisers
rose in fevered protest. One said that these
people should have “the same rights as they
had before the war,” just as one who con-
spired with others to murder us should have
the same rights and privileges and oppor-
tunities after failing in his attempt as be-
fore. Another said that these disabilities
tended “to foster national prejudice which
usually led to war.” If the war thus fos-
tered is any worse than the one we had
when we pampered the Hun and let him be
a voter, alderman, M.P. or even a Minister,
all that can be said is that it will be a
boshter war. The Bulletin is not keen on
wholesale disfranchisement. It realises that
there are a few Germans who hated Kultur
so much that they came here, at our in-
vitation, to escape it. It is for these to
plead for the separation of the sheep and
the goats. Lists should be prepared accord-
ingly.
The new programme in the Sydney build-
ing trade is “no work on Saturdays.” That
will mean fewer houses arid more house
famine, but it will also mean more time for
losing money to Aaron Shortodds at the
races. Aaron isn’t a producer or a unionist
or a horny-handed toiler. He is even sus-
pected of being a bloated capitalist. All the
same, solid unionists will leave off building
the homes that their fellow-unionists badly
need to go out and support him.
The hesitation of the Lawson team on the
question of raising the screws of Vic.
Assembly members from £3OO to £4OO a year
recalls the backing and filling of -the first
Turner Government in 1897 on the subject
of providing superannuation for Graham
Berry, who had just lost both the Speaker-
ship (£lOOO a year) and his seat for East
Bourke Boroughs, First of all
a voluntary deduction from
members’ salaries to buy an
annuity , was proposed; then a
bill for a pension . wag con-
sidered. Finally, after much
caucusing of Ministerialists and
Oppositionists, a measure was
rushed through appropriating
£31.00 for .the purchase of an
annuity- of £5OO a year. The
old man didn’t quite cut out the
amount; the insurance co. had
the benefit of the interest on
the unexpended portions of the
£3lOO during the six years, and
£lOO or so besides. The State
as a whole evidently thought
more of Berry than the Brunswickers did,
for it was in the year the Assembly saw the
last of him that* he. was elected to the
Federal Convention.
Broken Hill is on the bubble again.
Brookfield, MX.A., and O’Reilly, the A M.A.
check inspector, have been excommunicated
by the central executive of the A.L.P.
because of their association with the “indus-
trial” section of the movement; but, right or
wrong, the Barrier branch of the A.L.P.
wants them to go to the plebiscite for choos-
ing candidates at the next State elections'.
Despite instructions to the contrary from
the executive, the branch has decided to put
Brookfield and O’Reilly on the ballot-paper,
with the. result that the sticklers for consti-
tutional methods, including .Tabez Wright,
another local MX.A., have refused to have
anything to do with the vote. On present
appearances the central committee will have
to declare the Barrier branch bogus, and
then there will be a division of the sheep
and the goats, as there ought to be. That
men who simply loathe the methods of the
old Labor party, and want to completely
upend them, should he permitted to mas-
querade as Laborites has become a scandal.
“P.C. 200”: What’s the position in the
slander action, Mertons (metal brokers, Lon-
don) versus Hughes, Prime Minister of Aus-
tralia? When the last English mail left the
solicitors for the Commonwealth were wal-
lowing in affidavits (one, by the way, con-
tained 940 folios) and sundry other docu-
ments, some in German, some in French and
some in Hughes. The high cost of Hughes
during the war will stagger Australia to the
ropes when the full bill is delivered.
The mostly-Labor council of Richmond
(Vic.) is moving to have all metropolitan
Bumbles given free passes over all metro-
politan tramways, and is getting enthusiastic
support from other Bumbles. Really this is
too modest. Why should they not also have
free railway rides and free water? And when
Labor has nationalised the p-as, publichousos
and other utilities, these too ? Of course none
of the things could be free. Somebody has to
pay for them. And if that somebody is wise
he will see that all payments he makes are
direct payments. Then he will know what
he does pay. He won’t otherwise.
Almost the last thing Vic. Parliament did
before hurrying into recess was to facilitate
the payment of a cheque for £lOO to George
Prendergast as the first half-yearly instal-
ment of an allowance which he is to get as
Opposition leader. Of course, his successor
will be paid similarly, as the bill is of
general application. Only Mitchell, Groves
and Angus opposed the measure in the As-
sembly, and mainly through the good offices
of McWliae the Council took it at a gulp.
The determination of these politicians to per-
petuate the two-party system which bore
them is pathetic.
Of all Lawson’s Ministers Frank Clarke
wound up the session in the poorest form.
But for Socialist J. P. .Tones he would have
deserted that precious legislative infant, the
Factories and Shops Bill, when the House
of Dreariness was sick of everything and
everybody on the last day of the session.
Clarke was the foster-parent of the bill, but
as he had no knowledge of it or fancy for it
he proposed to toss it aside, and moved in
committee that the chairman leave the chair.
Jones found for once what an advantage it
was that he had earned the respect of the
Tories, for they listened to him attentively
while he told them all the good the young-
ster would do if given a chance —release
shop-assistants an hour earlier every Friday
night, make life worth living for tobacco-
nists who had unlimited hours of business,
and rectify a whole heap of anomalies. Jones
BASE INGRATITUDE.
On the subject of the brewers’ strike Mr. Garden,
secretary of the Sydney Labor Council, said: “The
workers have only upheld the industry because it
employed from 4000 to 5000 men. We are devising
means' to place the strikers in other industries if
possible.”
NUGGET : “The barman in there wouldn’t
chalk one up till pay day."
SNOWY : “ ’E’s a nark, orlright."
NUGGET : “Yes, ’e don’t seem to jerry that
we only drink to keep ’is clars in their
jobs.”
didn’t roar- at anybody, but reasoned clearly
and earnestly. While he was winning over
the majority, Lawson was metaphorically
shaking his fist at Clarke and declaring that
of all his sessional progeny this was the
dearest. So the wee thing was saved. But
what a system of democratic government it
is which commits a most important measure,
over which one House has spent days, to
the tender mercies of a Minister in the other
House who, if he isn’t actually hostile, is
indifferent about it!
According to the cable, French Finance
Minister Klotz told the Deputies: “There is
no reason why we should pay America and
Britain high prices for goods procurable in
Germany on more favorable terms.” Of
course, there’s no reason why France should
assist in restoring British industries but-
chered to save France from the spurred heel
of the Boche. At least, no immediate reason.
The Boche is heelless now, and if some day.
with the assistance of French importers, he
should become sufficiently dangerous to set
France again calling to Britain for help —7
well, Klotz may be dead by then. Mean-
time The Bulletin has hearty suspicions
that the cable is a lie.
The Argus on behalf of the profiteer:—
Evidence accumulates that efforts to overcome the
result of economic laws and reduce the high cost
of living by legislation or regulation will be not
merely futile, but will increase the scarcity from
which the whole world is suffering.
Fatman’s fraudulent assertion that nothing
can be done to mitigate outrageous prices is
on a par with his obsolete protests against
early closing, minimum-wage fixing, old-age
pensions, factory acts and every other regula-
tion which “interfere with private enter-
prise.” The fact that legislation has already
brought down with a run the cost of certain
commodities in Britain is merely regarded by
the Argus as accumulating evidence that the
thing can't be done, and no Government
which looks to the Farmers’ party for suit-
port must dare to attempt it.

THE OUTCOME.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Tlie battle’s o’er, and everywhere
Are screaming voices stilled ;
The scrutineers now register
The wounded and the killed.
The people are suffused with sense
Of duty fairly done,
And locking for high recompense
From splendid men who’ve won.
How sweet is this simplicity
Of men who’ve' understood
Elections such as this must he
Intended for their good !
They hold they’ve voted to secure
Tlie boons that most they need,
-And now a party* strong and pure
Will give the priceless meed.
To those elected in the stress
The outcome is quite plain—
The poll has given them success;
They seek no other gain!

The Wild Cat confesses that, though general-
manager Holmes gets a bigger salary, it
wouldn’t swap places with him even if it
were offered half-a-crown a week more. In
fact, it isn’t keen on running any bank
at all for the next few years. The Common-
wealth Bank is a bigger bugbear than many
people think. It hasn’t got shareholders
wanting 10 p.c. or more for their money; it
has control of a tremendous amount of very
cheap savings-bank money, and the more it
gets the larger the proportion it will be able
to safely employ ; it has a tremendously pro-
litable customer in the Commonwealth Gov-
ernment, which is also prepared to back its
bill to practically any extent; it has no
old dead horses to work off, no pensions to
pay yet awhile, no ancient barnacles in the
staff that it would be glad to be rid of;
it has made huge profits during the war
period and these constitute a capital on
which no hungry shareholder expects it to
make a big profit; and it has a general-
manager or governor who is in an extraordi-
narily favorable position to make the best
use of his exceptional knowledge of foreign
exchange. For other banks deposits are dear
and will continue so; but lending rates are
largely governed by what the Commonwealth
Bank is prepared to do; and it is prepared
to do things that private banks certainly
wouldn’t do under present conditions if the
other were out of the way. And while the
margin between borrowing and lending rates
is thus kept narrow, exes, are creeping up,
partly through taxation and partly through
the demand for higher salaries; and the end
hasn’t been reached yet. Apparently this
Westralian bank hasn’t felt the pinch of
higher exes, as most eastern banks have
done; still £39,823 worked head office and
<l5 branches in the half-year to September,
1914. whereas head office and 56 branches
cost £39,239 in the past half-year. Mean-
time, taxation, now £3625, has trebled. For-
tunately for the banks, though a great deai
of local business has to be done on a very
narrow margin, prices are very high, trading
profits are generally very good, and exchange
and other pickings correspond. But for that
tiie outlook for banks would be distinctly
gloomy.
And a bank which has confined itself to
Westralia has an outlook quite as gloomy
as the average. For many years the Gov-
ernment of the western State has been
living beyond its means and piling up deficits,
although its public service alleges that it
has meanwhile been starved: and if that
means anything it means that either money
has been wasted or taxation"'bas been insuffi-
cient. On the figures the latter is the more
likely. It seems inevitable that larger de-
mands will be made upon this bank ; and it
is probable that this will also mean, in some
cases, a reduction of property values, and
consequent losses of principal. For the
moment the new discoveries at Hampton
have turned attention from the rapid dwind-
ling of other goldfields; and the State is
entitled to feel a bit more cheerful on that
account. But it only signifies this —the
State has a little longer time to find some-
thing to take the place of gold-mining. That
really is the problem ; and experiences of the
past few years don’t promise an easy solu-
tion. Agricultural development has been slow,
and there has been a heavy proportion of
failures; fruit-growing, though it has given
very promising results, is a small matter;
and owing to the absence of good coal mea-
sures the outlook for manufactures is not
at all dazzling. The great gold discoveries
boomed the West: money was plentiful and
freely spent. The State will have to read-
just itself. It is a place where hard econ-
omy and plain living are pre-eminently called
for.
Meantime, certainly, there is nothing in
this bank’s figures to give anybody an un-
comfortable feeling:—

assets represent 34 p.c. of that total. Especi-
ally in view of the large proportion of
deposits at call, this does not allow much
of a margin for increased lending business.
Capital is £250,000; total funds belonging
to shareholders, £982,971, most of the
reserves having been provided by issues of
capital at a premium. The fixed deposits
do not amount to 30s. for every £1 of share-
holders’ funds; and there is just upon three
millions of assets to represent the £1,979,109
of deposits and other liabilities not covered
by liquid assets. The security for creditors
is therefore very good indeed ; on the other
baud, the comparatively small proportion of
the public money in the business means com-
paratively poor profits; and, though the 20
p.c. div. is not really anything like that on
the majority of shares which have been
issued at a big premium, the margin of un-
divided profits is narrow.

Public-accountant G. Mason Allard, who
nowadays spends much of his time Royal
Commissioning for the N. S. Wales Govern-
ment —for many months he has been con-
ducting an inquiry into the Public Service —•
is the Co-operative’s chairman; and the
account he gives of his stewardship is as
thorough as his reports to the Government.
Very often a young insurance co. is not
anxious for its figures to receive much pub-
licity ; but this one is frank and obliging
to the post-mortemist. Half a dozen pages
in the latest report are devoted to compara-
tive statements covering the life of the con-
cern, particularising the claims experience
and providing information about invest-
ments. The table goes back to the begin-
ning, when the Co-operative set out to
pioneer house-purchase insurance in the
Commonwealth. Just when the co. was find-
ing its feet the war upset all plans, and
since then building conditions have been so
abnormal that this side-line has not been
pushed to anything like the extent the pro-
moters anticipated. Only 74 house-purchase
advances have been made since operations
began ; and no less than 50 of these 74 have
since been repaid, many of the borrowers
having taken advantage of the good prices
offering for house property to make a few
pounds on their bargain. At Sept. 30 last
only £6960 was out in this class of mort-
gage, and though 37 new house-purchase
policies were written in the Ordinary dept,
last year (compared with 21 in the previous
year), only two new advances were applied
for and granted, these being on policies which
had been in force for some time.
Besides house-purchase insurance, the Co-
op. is also doing Ordinary and Industrial
business. Steady progress is made in the
former branch, and during the past 12
months 369 new policies assuring £124,900
(compared with 289 assuring £93,300 in
1918) were written. Premium income has
grown in this way: 1916, £4875; 1917,
£6324; 1918, £S37B; 1919, £11.422. So far,
despite war and ’flu, death claims have been
very light, only £3051 having been paid
out in eight years. The Industrial branch
is expanding slowly, premium income for the
past four years having been: 1916, £3660;
1917. £4451; 1918, £5446; 1919. £6505.
Until 1916 the Co-op. was paying away more
than it received, with the result that the
four years’ operations ran up a deficit of
£26 508. Since then the management has
gradually achieved a surplus. Nevertheless
last year it still cost £65 15s. to handle
£lOO of income.
The whole of the expenses shown in the
introductory table have not been charged
against premium income in the accounts;
shareholders have put up £56.932, and over
two-thirds of this has gone. In the balance-
sheet £40,126 of capital is represented by
the intangible asset. “Foundation, organisa-
tion and extension of business.” The his-
tory of the Co-operative can be set out in
this way. During its eight years £ll2 547
of income has been earned, £11.858 has been
paid in claims, and over £70.000 of exes,
have been charged against income, leaving
an assurance fund of £24,940. Deduct the
£40,126 of capital spent on getting business;
then operations so far have resulted in the
deficit of £15,186 shown in the last line of
the table.
•
No actuarial investigation has been made
since 1916; and only an actuary who has
overhauled the risks can say definitely
whether the £.24,940 of assurance funds were,
under normal circumstances, adequate at
Sept. 80. Besides the assurance funds there
is the shareholders’ capital represented by
tangible assets. Altogether the latest
balance-sheet showed net tangible assets of
£40,615, £29,785 of which was represented
by public securities, deposits and cash, £6960
was in house-purchase mortgages and £2058
in freehold property. In addition there
was about £20,000 of uncalled capital.
Valuations of policies are made every five
years, but towards the close of the latest
run the management asked its consulting
actuary whether there was “any necessity
to vary the advice” given 12 months pre-
viously as to allowing the next investiga-
tion to stand until 1921. Actuary Bremner’s
reply, included in the report, calls for com-
ment :—•
I see no reason to modify the opinion I gave a
year ago, that five years is short enough interval
between the actuarial valuations of the liabilities of
a young life office. While an old established co.,
with a large volume of well-spread business on its
books and correspondingly large reserves, may not
be seriously affected by fluctuations occurring from
year to year, a young co. can only secure that
wider field which eliminates chance fluctuations by
“taking stock” at longer intervals, thus obtaining
a steadier and more reliable average of its ex-
perience. Conditions have been far from normal
from .a life assurance point of view during the last
few years, and I am of opinion that no good pur-
pose would be served by a valuation of the co.'s
liabilities before the end of the current quin-
quennium.
This may be all very well so far as the Co-
op. is concerned, for it is run by steady
men who are not acquiring huge policy lia-
bilities at a very heavy cost. But the
statement that “five years is short enough
interval” for "a young life office” is too loose.
An actuary is supposed to be both a guide
and a brake to an insurance management,
and the more often the actuary stands be-
tween the policy-holder and the people who
hold his cash the better for all, particularly
in a concern whose management may have
a tendency to chase new business regardless
of cost.
As for the shareholders, the 30 to 50 p.c.
dividends which, according to the prospectus,
were distributed to proprietors of s'.milar con-
cerns in England are still a long way off.
With £40,126 of their £56,932 of paid capi-
tal temporarily lost, immediate prospects are
not cheerful. A lot apparently depends on
the opportunities the management will have
in future of extending its house-purchase
insurance; and inflated values and building
difficulties are all against it at present.

Most of the shipping cos. are nesting around
Bridge-street, Sydney, nowadays, so the
W. E. Smith factory, which has for many
years occupied a good office site there, has
been pushed out into the suburbs. The
move took place after the latest accounts
had been made up, and apparently none of
the costs of transplanting were charged
against the past half’s revenue. The co.
continues to do well, latest net profits being
equal to over 184 p.c. on paid capital. But
since Bs. was written off each £1 share a
few years ago (it was an Earle Hermann
flotation) the return is not all it looks; the
net profits are equal to just over 11 p.c.
on the old capital, and the 124 p.c. divs.
represent only 74 p.c. on that basis. The
improved results have been helped consider-
ably by shareholders’ patience while the
cleaning-up proceeded, thus permitting re-
serves to be accumulated. Another view of
the recovery the concern has made is shown
in this comparison of the balance-sheet

Liquid assets (inc. stock) 54,624 75,120 69,720

Just after the rubbish was swept away the
co. had a more-or-less liquid surplus of
£30,955; but it has since been increased to
£47,996. The improvement shown by the
balance-sheets over the 4| years has been
£14,274, equal to a very creditable 31 p.c.
on the written-down capital. And prospects
in the trade are pretty good ; for, while more
business is offering, it is very difficult
for new people to start in the business in
even a small way, owing to the scarcity aud
terrific present cost of printing plant. A
small press will bring at least three times
as much as the standard price of, say, five
years ago.
Buckley & Nunn, Ltd.—This Melbourne
retail softgoods concern, like Robert Reid &
Co., Ltd., with which it is closely associated
(Robert Reid is chairman of both cos.), was
driven by double taxation and other troubles
to remove its head-ottice to Australia. The
first locally-issued balance-sheet, for the year
to July last, has just been put out. Twelve
months previously the London accounts
showed a paid capital of £182,73S in £1 fully-
paid ordinaries and £130,000 of 5 p.c. deben-
ture stock, with £00,741 of capital repre-
sented by goodwill. The only difference in
the new co. is that 000 more £1 ordinaries
have been issued, apparently to give qualifi-
cation to Australian directors, while the 5
p.c. debenture stock has been replaced by
£150,000 of 7 p.c. cum. pref. share capital.
So far as the public is concerned it is inter-
ested only in the profs., 120,000 shares being
held in the Commonwealth; and both the
security for their principal and the prospects
of regular divs. look good. This compares
the figures disclosed by the last two balance-
sheets : 1918. 1919.

After making recent distributions, reserves
amounted to £05,571, leaving a margin of
£4830 over and above goodwill. At the July
balance there were net tangible assets with
a book value of £338,168 —over 455. to meet
every £1 of pref. capital. The £150.000
of p'refs. call for £10,500 per annum, while
disclosed net profits have moved in this way:
1910, £21,351; 1917, £18,088; 1918, £25,834;
1919, £42,659. Of the latest profits £13,413
went in premiums on debenture redemptions
and in meeting preliminary exes, and broker-
age; the ordinaries getting 10 p.c.

“Promoter”: Those odious regulations
under the War Precautions Act compelling-
people who wished to raise new capital for
industrial or mining cos. to apply for the
approval of the Commonwealth Treasury
have been repealed. They ought never to
have been gazetted. The regulations were
an irksome restraint of trade, although
their avowed object was to prevent money
going into enterprise that ought to have
gone into war. Another objective aimed at
was the suppression of the middle men, the
brokers, the promoters, without whom no
mining co. and few industrial cos. can secure
capital. With all his faults, his unappeased
appetite for paid-up scrip, and his urgent
wish to unload it quickly, the promoter has
his use. The regulations were ineffective
in stopping vendors and promoters getting
a “cut.” There were methods of hoodwink-
ing the Treasury officials, all green at the
game of analysing prospectuses, and gener-
ally unable to discover the nigger in the
woodheap. George Swinburne, and after
him John Higgins, peered into numer-
ous prospectuses, and when they didn’t see
the nigger they generally declined to ap-
prove the scheme. After two such refusals,
I personally abandoned the promotion busi-
ness, never too lucrative and always infer-
nally hard work. So it was the cos. one
did not attempt to float—the unborn gold,
tin and copper-mining cos. —which the Trea-
sury successfully stifled. Deliberately I
say that this Treasury control of company-
formation did more to kill Vic. gold-mining
than high wages and dear material.

The Commonwealth Government has pub-
lished the conditions of its offer of a bonus
of £lO.OOO for the production of 50,000 gal-
lons of petroleum in Australia. The Gov-
ernment wants private individuals to do im-
portant national work and promises a paltry
reward after oil has been proved. The time
to give the bonus is now, not by-and-bye.
There are fair prospects of finding petroleum
in Australia at a depth, and the proper way
to go about the job is to subsidise a big
boring corporation to drill for it in the Mai-
lee, the Western Division of N. S. Wales, or
in the Central Australian desert. The man
who strikes oil won’t want any miserable
ten thousand.

Money of a sort is simply rolling into
the Vic. Treasury. Despite the bad harvest
and the probable falling off of railway
revenue next half-year in consequence,
McPherson’s estimate of £13,904,953 for the
year (to June 30) will, it seems, be more
than realised. Although all the direct taxa-
tion is raised in the Jan.-June half, the
receipts already amount to £6,313,747, or
£946.577 more than for the July-December
period of 1918-19. There will be enough
coin to pay the extra expenditure involved
in raising railwaymen’s pay under the new
classification board’s scheme (for which no
specific provision was made) and still leave
McPherson his anticipated surplus of
£51,000.


The advantage of having battery charging current
on tap in the home garage is now within the reach
of every motorist. The G.E. Mercury Arc Battery
Charger makes anv ordinary lighting circuit a source
of energy for starting, lighting, and ignition bat-
teries. Its cost is a mere trifle compared with the
convenience and economy of home charging. An
overnight boosting charge every few weeks will not
only increase the efficiency of a battery, but will
also lengthen the life of the plates. You should
get one of these outfits. Australian General Electric

in the design of steam engines. A patented design
of “Uniflow” Steam Engine is now being made by

Highest efficiency and economy of steam con-
sumption is obtained with simplicity of construction
and low upkeep costs, and the results obtained
from this new type of engine have been so marked
as to place the "ordinary type of compound engine
quite out of date, the manufacture of which has

Several hundred millions of Australian
Government securities are locally held,
mostly by savings banks, plain banks and
life assurance offices, which means that they
represent the savings of a large section of
the people. If the loan madness continues
the hundreds of millions will become thou-
sands of millions, and the continuance of the
madness is on every party’s programme more
or less. Every new issue means adulter-
ating the security. This security is, in theory
at least, the total assets of the country; and
every time another hundred millions is bor-
rowed the security of the old lenders be-
comes less. Also, as the new lenders have
to get more interest because the security is
less, the value of the old bonds diminishes.
Away back in the good times Victoria floated
a loan of over £5,000,000 at 3 per cent., and
it has still 30 years to run. That was Aus-
tralia’s masterpiece. It looked like a first
mortgage then, but, through much subse-
quent borrowing on short-dated State and
Federal lOU’s which come due ahead of
it, it is more like a 121st mortgage now.
Public borrowing differs from loans on pro-
perty. The man who lends first to the State
is liable to come last in the way of security,
for the second or 102nd lien may become the
first. It is merely a matter of the date of
repayment. Yet the man who is the last
lender, and who dictates the date of repay-
ment, gets the biggest interest. Already the
people who got in early on even the W ar
Loan find their £lOO worth about £95 17s. (id.
and they are better off than some of the long-
dated folk. If the craze goes on there are
holders of 5 per cent, securities who may find
each £lOO they invested worth only £7O or
£BO because, in the struggle to keep up the
drunk by buying liquor on insufficient credit,
Holman, or someone like him, may be
reduced to ottering 7 per cent. In fact, un-
less the people who own Government bonds
shut down hard on the borrowing which
is always adulterating' their security and
putting preferred creditors ahead of them,
even worse things may happen. There have
been Treasurers in Australia who would bor-
row at much more than 8 per cent, it they
thought that only thereby could they make
things last their time.
It must always be remembered that a con-
siderable party—the party which believes in
the general strike and the hold-up of indus-
try and the “go slow” —hopes to see the debt
piled up to the breaking point in order to
bring about the general wreckage of ‘capi-
tal.” Repudiation was discussed at the
Perth Labor Conference and the matter was
referred to the Federal Labor party, which
probably felt that there was insufficient sup-
port, so it said nothing. Rut if the debt and
the interest bill can be raised to a point at
which it is necessary to greatly lower the
income-tax exemption and bring in uiaiij
thousands of new taxpayers, there is a
chance that many thousands of new people
will be converts to the idea of throwing
the public debt overboard, even if the whole
show is wrecked in the process. Every time
the Bolshevik fraud demands that all
public works now in hand be finished imme-
diately” by the aid of bigger loans than ever,
*it being the duty of the Government to find
srork for the people,” he has one eye on
coimediate popularity and the other on the
mature, when the unbearable size of the pui-
ten will make the repudiation doctrine popu-
lar, so that “capital” may vanish m the con-
fusion. In England it is always understood
that debt should be reduced in time of peace.
But- in Australia slummocky politicians
apparently regard borrowing as part of the
established order of things, to go on till the
country bursts.
“Mudpie”: Bulletin par about Avoca
11/l/’2O) suggests using plung'er pumps to
supply nozzle water up to 2001 b. pressuie.
The recommendation seems sound, except
that 2001 b. pressure is far too high to be
used with safety through an ordinary nozzle
of any size. It is probably also unnecessaiiiy
high. And plunger pumps of any type
would prove to be a curse. Several makeis
in Australia will supply series centrifugal
pumps for all pressures and designed to deal
with water not merely slimy but carrying
fine sand in suspension, which is a not un-
usual condition in sluicing. No other type
of pump should be considered. As to pres-
sure, 801 b. at the nozzle is high, though
special conditions might call for as much
as 1001 b. Rather than exceed this it would
lie better to shoot the ground down and put
on sufficient labor in the face to keep the
lumps broken up. A wide face is essential,
so that the face gang may have one section
on which to work while the nozzle is opera-
ting elsewhere. In shallow ground 15.1.
or less- -it is an advantage to have three
branches and three nozzles; otherwise two
are enough. In shooting the face down,
where possible use black powder; otherwise
a low percentage nitro-glycerine compound.
Fire four or five holes simultaneously with
a centre battery. For boring the holes an
auger is usually too slow. Try a hand-
power spring percussion drill flushed with
wate r—the latter can be got from a branch
pipe off the nozzle pump. A suitable drill
used to be obtainable from one Pickstock m
the Maitland district, and was used success-
fully at Y-Water for some time. Some
ground is too blamed hard and stony t° be
tackled by means of sluicing, but if it ca
be dealt with at ail the above remarks might
be taken more or less seriously, because
they are based on experience.
After doing a perish (it has done a num-
ber to date) Northampton lead field O'-A.)
is expected to have a revival shortly. m
Green’s claim, for which £40,000 was re-
fused last year, a lot of rich ore is exposed,
and on another close by owned by Dome
Doolette, Trude and others similar stuff
is in sight. Recently the district had a
chance of getting some Broken Hill monos;
spent on it, but owing to one party ot
leaseholders backing out what would hai e
been a good thing for the district didn’t come
off. Now, instead of one big amalgamation
and an output of several thousand tons of
lead a month, a few parties are. preparing
to work their individual shows, with the in-
evitable result that everyone will make much
less money than if one strong co. had come
in and done the whole job—especially the
job of equipment.
Eighty-year-old G. P. Doolette presided at
the Bullfinch meeting in London and boomed
the Wombola leases, which were recently
taken up in Westralia. He said that if
developments warranted a new co. would be
registered to take Over the property • and
open it. As regards the Bullfinch, certain
work which the co. had not hitherto been
able to do on account of want of funds was
now being carried out, and a considers bl 3
area of ground which was believed to con-
tain payable ore would be tested.

Star Exploration, Ltd., which originally
owned some big tailings dumps at Kalgoorlie
and now holds a big block of Lake View and
Stars, besides mining interests in America,
Africa and elsewhere, held a meeting- in
London recently. The balance-sheet showed
a big appreciation in assets and a dividend
of 10 p.c. less income-tax of 6s. in the £
was declared. The chairman stated -that
with a view to strengthening the financial
position of the co. and to enable the Board
to seize opportunities for making money out
of speculations that might present them-
selves, the unissued capital would be let loose
early this year. It was also announced that
the ’co. had taken £lOOO worth of shares in
the National Mining Corporation, which has
just been floated with a paid-up capital of
£3.000.000 to dabble in mines, oil wells and
industrial undertakings. The directors in-
clude F. A. Govett (chairman of the Ivan-
hoe) and J. A. Agnew, late of Kalgoorlie.

“Oof Bird” (W.A.) : Edna May Battler
is at it again. It has just paid £l5OO
towards the purchase of the Trafalgar at
Southern Cross, and has until June next to
find the balance. Meantime in order to
break and crush some of the 16s. to 60s. ore
alleged to be visible, and the “payable” stone
dumped on the surface, it is getting ready
to stir up shareholders for calls and to try
to borrow £3OOO from the State to buy a
mill. Why doesn’t the Board go on develop-
ing and put all thoughts of a mill out of its
head until the permanency of the mine has
been established? Judging by its past the
co. should have had enough of the policy
of sacrificing the mine for the market. If
it hasn’t the public has.

Shares reserved for Australia in the
Hampton Celebration were allotted in Perth
on Christmas Eve. Nearly double the num-
ber available were applied for, and a 50-p.c.
allotment was made to those wanting more
than two or three hundred and the full num-
ber to those who applied for less. The co.
starts with a cash working capital of
£75.000 and about £BO,OOO worth of gold in
sight. # # # ,
Perth and Kalgoorlie are in the dumps
over the failure of the Oversight and Tara,
at Board Arrow. Both were reckoned
bonanzas, but as -is often the case the gold
vanished when the prospectors went out and
the option syndicates walked in. There is
talk of the two cos. pooling their cash and
buying the Gt. Unknown, at Marda, on the
Mt. Jackson field. Some rich crushings have
been taken out of this show by Dorrie Dool-
ette and others, and a small, well-equipped
co. might do well out of it.

The crowd which runs Laloki (Papua)
Copper Mines is a good shandy-gaff combina-
tion. Philip Charley and Alex. Campbell
represent the old Broken Hill brew; John
L. Wharton and George King furnish pre-
sent-day ginger. Laloki is a legacy from
the Great Fitzroy. This isn’t saying much,
seeing how that Queensland show burst the
reputations of a whole unit of Bewick-
Moreing’s Yankee fledglings. When King
took over from Loring, on the latter being
translated to London after Hoover’s final
break with the firm, he fastened on to
Laloki as the Great Fitzroy’s sheet anchor.
Perhaps that was the reason why Mt Mor-
gan got an option over it after the Fitzrov
had thrown up the sponge in Queensland
and Papua. The Great War knocked Mt.
Morgan out, but John L. Wharton, with the
Baillieus behind him, hooked on just as ivlug
had done. Huntley, of the Hampden, sent
to run the rule over it, also enthused. Hence
the present co., with its long option over a
niine which Collins House describes as the
best youngster in its stable. -thus tai
£35.700 has been mopped up in-plant and
development, and another iioUO at tne
Dubuna. A railway is being built to the
coast. When this line is completed an
output of 5000 tons monthly is expected
from one of the biggest medium-grade cop-
per formations opened within the past hi e
years anywhere south of the line. Ihe
quietness with which everything has been
done has not shut out of view the promise
of recent developments.
Croweater pluck has tackled Mitta Mitta
(Yic.) tin under the leadership of one of
the rich Collingrove Angases, but hasn t
made much progress. So far it isn t clear
whether this arises from grade ot ore or
quality of plant. The first shot at milling
was with a new grinder or some other device
which was to. crush more than one of the
Lake Superior stampers. But the thing
didn’t go at Mitta Mitta when called upon
to handle the greisen in bulk, so the agree-
ment to purchase was cancelled. Having
learnt a bit, the Board then called in staid
J. B. Lewis. He prescribed ordinary bat-
tery treatment. Trial runs with a. 3-head
mill have been up to the mark, so a 10-head
mill is to be put in, when of course profits
are to hum along. So far 200 tons have
yielded “about one ton tin oxide.” What
charming indefiniteness! Still, manager
Brook is cock-a-whoop over the result, but
he can be warned to be wary, or, judging
by the reported size of the shoots of ore,
the mill may waltz ahead of the stamper.
Mitta Mitta ever since the Glen Wills rush
under L. L. Smith has been anathema to
Victorians, but there are plenty of patches
of tin oxide in the granite to lure the
imaginative on. Brook’s game, therefore, is
to prove big reserves. With J. B. Lewis’s
experience at the Anchor mine behind him,
the fatality of that low-grade tin concern
may be avoided. But the risk is there.

Respectfully submitted that Charlton
Bod, B.Sc., field superintendent, deserves the
D.C.M. for the pluck he has shown in the
boring for oil at Tantanoola (S.A.). On
November ,20, 1918, the drill jambed at
1260 ft. So frozen in was it that the fish-
ing pipe-line could not shift it an inch,
finally itself smashing under the strain. In
Jan 1919, having fresh tools to go ahead
with, Dod settled down to jar the “frozen”
pipes upwards; but disaster came when the
fishing-line socket got tangled up in the
casing. His next dodge was to try to side-
track the old Sin. casing. In the end the
upper portion had to be shot off with explo-
sives and a fresh start made at BSoft. Things
went O.K. down to over 1100 ft., and a 6|in.
pipe was slipped into place. This had to be
left because the surface plant got out of
trim. When work was resumed the pres-
sure kinked the casing, so everything had
to be drawn up to 620 ft. By this time Sept.,
1919, had arrived. Then more side-tracking
was started, and with luck the pipe was
carried down to below the lost Sin casing.
Another breakage then tied things up a bit;
but by bailing out the sand the pipe has
been got through the belt of mobile stuff,
until now it is nearly back at the 1260 ft.
mark. Once there a rally will be made
with 6§in. piping into unexplored country,
where, if there be oil, Dod won’t be long
in finding it. Everything, of course, depends
on the “if.” All the same, there aren’t
many records in Australian mining of
such ding-dong pluck and ingenuity having
been introduced into a forlorn hope, and
Dod deserves a cheer. The Bulletin tells
this yarn because it is as much up to the
Commonwealth and the State to see Dod
through his present enterprise as it is to get
the Ross Smith party on from Charleville.

“Nor’-West” : There is no doubt, as The
Bulletin suggests (25/12/’l9), profiteering
in tin-buying is rampant. The producer,
particularly the small miner, fossicker and
the like, has had a bad deal for years, and
it is just about time some inquiry was made
into the business. The “unit” is the means
whereby the producer is hoodwinked. Last
week the price of tin (metal) rose in London
over £l5. A mysterious potentate, we’ll call
him Riley, fixes the “unit” in Australia, and
when the miner or fossicker brought his tin
in to sell he was calmly informed that Riley
had not altered the “unit” ! It was useless
for the fossicker to protest and point out
the good and steady rise in price; all the
satisfaction he could get was “They’re fright-
ened of the market, and the ‘unit’ has not
altered.” Should a fall of a pound or two
occur in the price, it is remarkable, though,
how promptly Riley drops the “unit.”
Country members of Parliament have pro-
tested several times about this business and
have received the usual vague promises to
the effect that “inquiries will be made” ; but
nothing else happens. The tin producers are
not a united body, and have no organisation,
therefore they are an easy prey. We’re
hoping things will improve when our own
tin-plate industry is estaolished.

Charley Cox, who commanded a brigade
of Light Horse in Palestine and headed the
Senate poll in N. S. Wales, is easily the
worst public speaker who stood on any plat-
form or soap-box during the election. The
reporters couldn’t make head or tail of him
and ended up by writing pars, which they
guessed would cover what Charles meant to
say but didn’t. He always began with “I
am pleased to be here,” rambled on good
naturedly for ten minutes and sat down in a
hurry amidst loud applause, having omitted
to mention anything.
If Irvine follows the Madden precedent, as
he is entitled to do, he can from February 1
draw the full screw of the Governor (at the
rate of £5OOO a year) as well as of Chief
Justice (at. £3OOO a year). At present his
Icy Ex. is paid as Lieut.-Gov. at £2500 a
year. Stanley, who retires on January 31,
receives the other £2OB 10s. a month.
From the Gallery hand :—-
The blindness of
party allegiance is
revealed by Story’s
enormous majority
in Boothbv (S.A.).
Story, who was
once a Senator,
was turned on to
the electors of
Boothby when the
inoffensive Dankel
retired on account
of his Gern an
origin. He is al-
most unknown to
Hansard, and the
galiery only remem-
bers him as a
fatigued old gentle-
man who crawls in-
to the House for
five minutes or so
and then wearily
crawls out again.
He .shows strong
symptoms of vital-
ity only over a
game of cards or
other little social
pleasures with fel-
low-members, yet
he was so certain
of his return that
he was back in the
old armchair on the
MONASH.
Sunday morning after the election.
Denis Gaynor D’Arcy, of Long Bay (Syd-
ney) Penitentiary, who succeeds the late
Sam McCauley as Comptroller of N.S.W.
prisons, was born at Rylstone in IS6B. He
joined the service in 1885, and worked along
until he became McCauley’s lieutenant and
understudy. In his younger days he was a
first-grade footballer and cricketer. Dr. Con-
stance D’Arcy, the first woman member of
Sydney Uni. Senate, is a sister.
Of the two M.L. politicians who were
handed a gaud on January 1, one is very
rich and the other isn’t. Robert Heaton
Rhodes, the affluent person, is a grandson
of that old-time Sydney shipmaster who
bought much of the Windy Isles for three-
penn’orth of gin or thereabouts and begat
a family that waxed fat. Robert is the
first of the big clan to have a title. He
first tried to get into politics 30 years ago,
and was well beaten at Christchurch by a
journeyman bootmaker with red whiskers.
Later a cocky constituency accepted him,
but at the general election the other day
kicked him hard. He was a faithful, ami-
able Masseyite. William Herries, the other
knight, is an Englishman, big, burly and
jovial, the son of a London barrister. He
settled at Te Ai-oha in ’81: M.P. since ’96
he has been Minister for Railways for seven
or eight years, is 64 and addicted to wear-
ing a grin and old clothes. Rhodes never
detected a joke in his life. Herries sug-
gests a man who regards the whole scheme
of human affairs as hilarious.
The House of Reps., which is not strong
in orators, has lost one of its most fluent
speakers through the defeat of the old Labor
member for Brisbane. Finlayson has a
great flow of eloquence that was born in
Scotland and has never acclimatised itself.
The dour atmosphere of his native land also
made him a social
Puritan, with a
special hate for
drink. He battled
hard to close up
the bar at the
House, which is
specially licensed
to trade after
hours; but with all
his eloquence and
pertinacity he was
never able to im-
prove the grog sup-
ply by so much as
a glass of milk.
Yet, despite his in-
temperate temper-
ance, Finlayson is
a lively citizen, and
can roll out a good
song in a fine bari-
tone voice. In the
ditties and “busi-
ness” o f II arry
Lauder he was the
old House’s best
entertainer.
CHARLIE
SKERRETT,
K.C., of
Wellington (M.L.) .
Next session N. S. Wales Parliament will
have to get another father, for Charles Alfred
Lee, member for Tenterfield for the past
35 years, will be missing. At 77 he finds
the track getting too rough. “Dad” was
never in the front rank, but he was a useful
administrator-— The Bulletin’s Solemn
Lee —as Minister for Justice with George
Reid in 1898-99, and Minister for Works
with Carruthers (1904-07) and Wade
(1907-10).
Among the slaughtered M.L. Liberals who
seemed to have sure seats was Albert Edward
Glover'. But even sport and personal popu-
larity and a fine capacity for saying “What’s
yours?” could not keep Auckland Central for
“Albert Edward.” He goes out whipped by
a Labor man, burly Bill Parry, who was in
the Waihi strike trouble. Bill is a sledge-
hammer speaker, and Premier Massey will
know it when the newcomer swings the
English language round his head.
Father Tom Ivelsh, of AVestbury (Tas.),
has not been in robust health of late and has
resigned from the council of the University
of Tasmania. He has sat there for 30 years,
and is the last of the men who made file first
council when the University was created in
1890. Ilis place has been taken by Dr. Barry,
the newly-arrived Catholic Coadjutor-Arch-
bishop of Hobart, who came from the Sydney
diocese. Father Kelsh lately celebrated the
golden jubilee of his ordination as a priest
by Bishop Wilson, the first Bishop of
Hobart.
A link with the Sydney of the ’thirties
was broken at Brighton (Eng.) lately when
F. 11. Biddulph went west at 82. His
father. Captain Edward Biddulph, R.N., was
the pioneer of the oversea steam traffic,
bringing his family to Australia in the
paddle-wheeler Sophia Jane, 256 tons, 50
h.p., of which he was part-owner. The little
vessel arrived in May, 1831, and took up
trade between Sydney and Newcastle. The
Australian Steam Conveyance Co. bought
her, but the venture was not successful. After
it had failed the treasurer, John Thomas
AVilson, quitted Sydney without warning,
leaving £30.000 of debts unliquidated. F. 11.
Biddulph joined the Tuckers in the wine
and spirit trade, and later became a member
of the old firm of Harbottle, Biddulph and
Bligh, having the management of the Mel-
bourne house. He was, incidentally, a mem-
ber of the earliest Hunt Club.
Edwin Smith, who died the other day in
Adelaide, was a member of the first volun-
teer defence force formed in S. Aus. That
was in 1854, and he was a member of No. 5
Company of Infantry. Thomas Burgoyne,
who for many years was S. Aus.’s oldest
M.P., was a member of the same regiment,
and is now the sole survivor of No. 5 Com-
pany.
Hugh Mahon, who, after an enforced rest
of three years, is back in the Reps, again
as member for Ivalgoorlie, made his first
acquaintance with Melbourne as the depart-
mental roundsman of the Herald 28 years
ago.
Having put in 40 years as teacher, inspec-
tor and assistant chief inspector, T. W. Both-
royd, one of Tate’s right-hand men, has gone
out on a Vic. pension of four hundred a year.
J. H. Betheras, a man w r ith heaps of go in
him, and another disciple of Tate, is likely
to be his successor. Leach, who specialises
in birds and insects, will receive a lift into
a higher grade of inspectors, and get nearer
his objective.
In the ’eighties and ’nineties, when Federal
Minister Groom’s father was up for election
in Toowoomba and Drayton (Q.) he always
relied on the German vote to give him a
lead. On one occasion the crowd around
the polling-booth in Toowoomba was sur-
prised to see a long column of men number-
ing about 400 marching down from Middle
Ridge (Germantown) in fours, with an old
veteran, Dr. Berger, mounted on a horse,
in command, yelling out orders. When
Groom’s opponents (and he had many bitter
ones) saw the parade, they knew the fight
was all over. Groom got every vote. On
December 13 Groom’s son in the Darling
Downs was up against that crowd pretty
solidly. The war-time disfranchisement of
Australians of German birth still rankled,
and also cost Groom’s colleague Glynn a
heap of votes in his very Hunnish S. Aus-
tralian electorate.
Keith and Ross Smith are Adelaide-born,
and their mother is native-born too. She
was Jessie Macpherson, of Moora, Westralia,
before Andrew Smith brought her across to
South Aus.
In August, 1840. a band of French immi-
grants arrived at Akaroa (M.L.) to estab-
lish a French colony, and the last of the
party, James Libeau, died the other day at
85. By the way, Libeau, who married a
French girl, a fellow-emigrant, had a family
of 14, and left over 100 direct descendants;
and several other of the families of these
French pioneers ran from 15 to 20.
Died a few days ago, at 76, C. J. Penny,
the first clerk engaged by the Bank of Adel-
aide ; that was in 1865. At the age of 25
in consequence of eye trouble he went to
England to consult an oculist, but the trip
didn’t end for five months, and by that time
he was blind, and he never recovered his
vision. His wife was a daughter of John
Stephens, at one time a proprietor of the
Adelaide Register.
Glenelg (S.A.), where Governor Hind-
marsh landed from the Buffalo on Decem-
ber 28, 1836, and “proclaimed” the new
province, has kept its 83rd birthday. The
last of the Buffalo pioneers have just died
out, but two of 1837 —one native-born —-
signed the roll-call at Glenelg this time. F.
B. Oldham, of 1838, did the talking, and did
it vigorously.
Seventy last week, Eustace Grundy, Iv.C.,
of Adelaide. Lancashire-born, he came to
S.A. in 1874, married the daughter of Chief
Justice Hanson, and joined Ingleby, K.C., in
practice. But for the last 40 years the firm
has been Grundy and Pellv: Burton Hardy
came in lately. In his leisure time Grundy
is head of the League which exists to protect
the Park Lands of Adelaide from the hand of
the spoiler.
Donald Mackinnon looks visibly brighter
since Barrister Maxwell's Federal triumph
in Prahran. Three months ago the con-
stituency was utterly hopeless, but the re-
sort to organised opposition at Nationalist
meetings, without the slightest reason,
rapidly stirred up the anti-Caucus vote and
swung Maxwell in. It is a painful lesson
to Hannan, who threw away £6 a as
M.L.A. for Albert Park to grab £l2 a week
in the Federal House. He deserved a bett< r
fate and may thank the rowdy section of
his supporters for the fix in which he
finds himself.
Lawson’s Government will not have quite
so much patronage to distribute this recess
as last, but it will have some. It was of
course responsible for the Manifold knight-
hood for a start, and it may get something
of the kind for Speaker Mackey in June.
A Supreme Court Justice, a County Court
Judge, seven Health Commissioners, three
temporary (part-time) Closer Settlement
Commissioners (including possibly J. M. Gil-
lespie and Brig.-Gen. F. G. Hughes), and
three members of the Fair Profits Commis-
sion are to be picked.
Sydney Loch, writer of “The Straits Im-
pregnable,” in which he put down what he
saw and suffered at Gallipoli while orderly
to Brig.-General Johnson, went back to
England round the Horn. It took him just
s,x months to do it, and filled him with
impressions of sea
life and raging
waves. On his
homeward way he
called on John
Murray, the pub-
lisher, and then
went to his father’s
place in Cumber-
land. The Panama
Canal takes the
place of Cape Horu
for the future, and
the old route is
pretty well dead.
Basil Lubbock was
the last man who
attempted to des-
cribe it, and his
book was written
nearly 20 years
ago. Li eh will
probably be the
last Englishman to
use it as a back-
ground for a mod-
ern tale of the sea.
REAR-ADMIRAL

troller.
Homeward-bound for Australia, Curtis
Atkinson, who served on Brisbane Daily
Standard, left with the Ist A.G.H. in ’l4,
but managed to get to Gallipoli with a field
ambulance and then transferred to the 9th
Battalion. Wounded at Flers and Menin
lioad, he was discharged in England at the
end of 1917, got a job with Northcliffe’a
Evening News, and then was sent along to
Lord Beaverbrook’s Department of Informa-
tion. There he helped to do that propaganda
work which Ludendorf says was tlie deciding
factor in the war.
“Gallery”: The jaunty figure of Jimmy
Boyd has at last fallen in the Nationalist
scronghold of Ilenty (Vic.). James, usually
truculent in anger, and breezily con-
temptuous in any other mood, has always
kept his hardest word for the Labor poli-
tician and the toiler behind him. As a coat-
mine d rector he has shown his teeth oil
one or two occasions, and Labor has been
saving itself for the day when it could repay
with interest. Laborites represent only about
2o p.c. of the vote in Henty, but this time
they had to show a preference, and thev
lodged it in the ratio of five to one in favor
of the Independent, Francis, and so smote
the Hon. James. It was a terrible blow for
one of the pillars of Nationalism, but Bovd
had honestly earned the clout.
E. J. Horwood, who goes from Broken Hill
to the Melbourne office of the B. H. Prop.,
leaves a fine record of things done. As far
back as ISB6 he was construction engineer for
C, and E. Miller, who built the railway line
from Mannahill to Broken Hill. With the late
A. T. Creswell he surveyed the surface and
underground workings of all the then leading
mines, and also laid down the Tarrawingee
railway in 1890. Joining the staff' of the
B. 11. Prop, two years later he was appointed
Broken Hill manager in 1899, and has held
the job ever since.
While Philip Fysh, the long, lean, gentle-
manly -Vandemonian, was still in Federal
politics. Will Dyson, as a youthful carica-
turist, found himself at an A.N.A. banquet
with a large assortment of fair game, and
disdaining the turkey got down to work on
the crowd. He had the usual trouble with
most of his victims who, naturally, would not
keep their faces still, but when he came to
the veteran Tasmanian in addition to an
“easy” face he struck an excellent pose. The
artist passed on to others, and quite 15
minutes later, when he was far down the
line, an attendant touched him on the
shoulder, and whispered: “Sir Philip says
that if you have finished sketching him he
will be glad to resume his meal.”
Gibson Young, who does the musical notes
for Melbourne Herald, could never be en-
tirely overlooked in any company. Having
advanced ideas on music as a means of
national uplift, he is helping to put the
Workers’ Educational Assoc, on the right
track; and he will lecture on the Musical
Great whenever called on. He flutes a
little, fiddles a little, and even occupies an
odd hour in painting a little—trying to ex-
press harmony in oils. Young bought his
musical training at the same British shop
as organist Floyd and Fritzalbert-street
Hart, and all three have always been fully
prepared to teach Australia all they know—
and perhaps a bit more in an emergency.
For the rest, Young owns a nice collection
of ties and a monocle.

"ltoss Smith’s mechanics mended the broken pro-
peller of the airplane at Anthony’s Lagoon with
hoop-iron and fencing-wire.”
The coach goes lumbering to the Western Edge,
Two tons of mails borne for four hundred miles
Of dusty plain and swampy river-sedge,
Tricked and manoeuvred through by endless wiles
Of one bush Atlas and his grass-fed team,
Through the long sunlight and the midnight gleam.
A thousand miles, and , all their drought and flooding
Faced with a tomahawk and fencing-wire;
The danger strengthening and peril blooding
The youth above all courage of his sire.
The Deluge he opposes with an ark
Made with some greenhide rope and stringy bark!
So with his land’s resource to steel his courage
He makes war a burlesque in which he wins,
Killing a thousand men, or skating forage,
Pulling Death’s leg with ribaldry and grins—
Bless thee, my brother, of our land contest,
And of the strength sucked from her gracious breast!
And thou, my brother of the upper skies,
With engines loud-exhausting to the stars.
Thine airship’s insolent stern the Pleiades
Have seen and marvelled at; and there are scars
The where thy swift propeller cut the gales
And tore the ether, as a cyclone sails.
My brothers who their dam, Australia, proved
On the stark plain laved by the high-swung moon,
Or in their engined bird that downward moved,
As brokeu-winged, to Anthony’s Lagoon;
As stringy-bark and greenhide saved the sire,
You skyward soar on grit and fencing-wire.

Dress item from “Jeames”: —
The movement to inflict brightly-colored men's
clothes on London is as old as the Sumptuary Laws.
It breaks out periodically, amidst loud cries of
approval from the tailors, and is swiftly laughed to
death. Eminent men have backed it at different
times. Nearly a century ago, when Lady Blessing-
ton was holding court at Kensington, Disraeli used
to dine out in a black velvet coat lined with blue
satin, red waistcoat, purple trousers with gold
braid down the sides, ruffles at his neck and wrists,
and “white kid gloves with from eight to ten rings
worn outside.” In the nineties of last century Oscar
Wilde appeared at evening parties in purple dress
clothes with a sunflower in his button-hole. His
day costume about this time was usually light
blue, and in his right hand he carried an arum-lily.
Wilde set several fashions, however, which look like
lasting as long as his plays. He was the first Bri-
tisher to wear the type of soft felt hat which now
surmounts the dome of 95 per cent, of town-dwellers
in Australia; and he is understood to have intro-
duced brown shoes 'to London. Edward VII., then
Prince of Wales and the arbiter of fashion for Eng-
land, denounced the latter as outrageous for a time,
but ended by wearing them himself. Nowadays the
most strenuous workers in the cause of brilliant
attire are the actors. Seymour Hicks, George Gros-
smith and Joseph Coyne have all been guilty in
varying degrees. The greatest difficulty which faces
the tailors and those who exhibit their wares in
public. is the fact that many of Britain’s most dis-
tinguished men dress like dustmen. Arthur Balfour.
England’s beau ideal of a gentleman, is virtually
a wearer of reach-me-downs: no tailor can induce
him to try on a suit of clothes. Lord Hugh Cecil,
Winston Churchill and hundreds of lesser intellectual
lights, are plainly indifferent as to what they wear.
Not England but America is where the gaudy clothes
fashion would have its best chance of success. Many
thousands combine the two chief requirements—the
wealth of Croesus and the taste of Ethiopia.

“Silas”: Among other things put into
June’s stocking this Christmas was a small
calico book of the English alphabet, done
in bright colors, and designed for the instruc-
tion of the very young in the rudiments of
our language. After a glance at the thing I
developed . a bewildered kind of interest. I
struck for instance: “E begin! in. Here,
goes engine, a big man tries to ride on.”
Then the letter “O” : “O ’Oranges and lemons
begins in. Oranges rounder, lemons yellow.”
Then “X”: “X Xmas begins in. How a
happy day we have. Mama hungs all the
toys we could have. Oh. merry xmas!”
“Y” : “Y Yacht begins in papa bought Dick
the yacht He and jack come to the pond
with it to make ’em Sail.” The formula “A
begins in,” “B begins in,” etc., goes right
through to the ridiculous end, where I en-
countered : “Rag Books Made in Tokyo,
Japan.” Then I understood. The adaptable
Jap had been employed to educate the infan-
tile Australian mind in the eccentricities of
our own speech.

“Copabella” : Nearly every day the metro-
politan papers print stories of distress, and
monetary assistance is sought by sympathetic
people for the sufferers.
One wonders how many
of them are like this. A
northerly of Christmas
week brought in its train
in the Western District
of Victoria a small bush-
fire, and a settler in the
back country near Para-
parap was burnt out. His
selection was so far
“back” that few knew
anything of the old man
beyond that his block was
small and expensive to
clear, and that he was
apparently poor. One
who had heard of his
plight sent out an s.o.s.
through the Geelojig
papers, a fund in four
places was quickly open,
and money began to roll
in. A day or two was
needed for the news of
the sympathy to reach
Paraparap, and then
came from the sufferer this
staggering missive to one
of the papers: “I will ad-
mit I am at a great loss
through the fire, but as
the work at Paraparap is
only a hobby of mine it
is a matter of indifference
to me whether I continue
it or n0t.... I would not
accept any subscription,
and am writing this for
the benefit of the gener-
ous public who may be
tempted to subscribe to
an undeserving case.”
He was “surprised” at
the help being offered,
and the public’s idea of
his financial position was gained under a
“great misapprehension.” But there is some-
thing of heroism in the man who chooses for
a “hobby” the clearing of Otway timber
country!
# * * *
“Six and Eight”: After reading a recent
report of the Sydney Public Librarian, people
who pictured clergymen spending week-
days wresting from the Word of God tidings
of damnation with which to harrow their
congregations on Sundays must have felt
like a pug. does after a jolt on the jaw.
Ifould says “the country clergyman, as
evidenced by correspondence received, is
mainly interested in poultry.” The high-cost
of living may explain the slide from grace.
“Boyd Cable”: I find that Venice has
adopted a scheme I’d like to see clamped on
to all Australia—for abolishing tips in
hotels and restaurants. Notices are pasted
all round the walls of the cafds, hotels and
feed-places that Tips are Abolished, or For-
bidden, or Prohibited, in some cases Rigor-
ously, in others Vigorously, in others
Severely. The new plan is to add a per-
centage to the bill —from 10 to 15 per cent.
You get your hill showing the items and
the total and then, separately, the amount
due for “service.” I don’t know which is
the more unpleasant feeling to own on
WON ON A FOUL.
“So Mabel loved and lost?”
“Bless you, no! She got two thousand damages .”
leaving your hotel —that you’re an escaping
criminal who has dodged out without pay-
ing some under-boots or forty-second waiter,
or that you’re a cross between a coward
and a prodigal spendthrift who has lavished
over-sized tips all round to escape being
charged under the first count. You have
none of that in Venice, anyhow, and there
I was able for the first time in my record
to leave a good hotel in peace and comfort
and without either or both of the aforesaid
unpleasant sensations. There is another
large-sized advantage that appeals even more
to Australians —it wipes out the servility
required a.t times to secure the tip. Tipping
reverses the action that Shakspeare (or
was it Will Lawson?) tacked on to the
quality of Mercy; it curses him that gets
and him that gives. It is a blot on free
manhood, and when a Dago country finds
it good to wipe it out, surely Australia
needn’t linger on the way ! If or when it
adopts the tip-abolishing plan, it might do
worse than take this Venetian one of show-
ing in plain figures pn the bottom of the
bill what the amount charged for service is.
explaining that the amount will be divided
on an agreed basis amongst the staff, and
that any crawler found taking a tip will be
removed “ severamente “ rigorosamente ”
and “ vigorosamente,” which I understand to
be by the slack of the pants.
“Yarra Ben”: Taking medicine in Mel-
bourne is almost a crime nowadays. Any-
how, it’s being made as difficult to obtain
drugs as drink. A new Act just passed, or
rather rushed, by both Houses requires that
chemists’ shops shall be closed on four days
of the week at 6 p.m. But, thank the Lord,-
the undertakers are always open for orders!
* * * *
“Two Blues”: The launching of a new
high-speed cruiser recalls an Atlantic war
yarn. The first Yank destroyers were met
on the fringe of the danger-zone by a
famous English commander. After the usual
formal greetings had been exchanged, the
Yank semaphored: “Am doing 30. W'!
slow down if necessary.” Across the waves
went the prompt reply: “Please don’t. Am
doing 40, but will circle round.”
“Dinkum”: Sydney Telegraph remarked
(28/12/T9) :
The ridiculous story, printed in a London news-
paper, of the mobbing of English brides of Aus-
tralian soldiers will, it is to be hoped, be contra-
dicted at once by Australia’s representatives on the
spot.
It wouldn’t do any good if it was. The
yarn about the steward whose blood boiled
at the spectacle of Australians heaving
stones and tomatoes at the brides appeared
in John Bull. Horatio Bottomley, the
editor, caters for a type of Tommy who hates
the Aussies like poison. It is the old, old
business of “Gherchez Id femme.” Prior to
the war this class of Tommy augmented his
exiguous pay by the profession of being seen
in public with nursemaids. There was a
regular schedule of fees, ranging from 3d. an
hour for private soldiers up to 7d. for
n.c.o.’s; in the case of decorated sergeants
the remuneration soared as high as 9d. Then
the war came, and with it the Diggers. They
speedily proved themselves aij. army of black-
legs. They were not content merely to cut
rates: they dispensed with payment alto-
gether. All over England nursemaids might
be seen, both with perambulators and solo,
and by their sides tall, svelte Diggers wear-
ing ribbons which made the long-service
decorations of the native-born look cheap as
mud. Complaints were made to Horatio.
He promised that he would investigate the
matter; and —after communing with his
Maker apart, as is his custom—attend to it
in John Bull. He has been doing so ever
since, chiefly by means of stories designed to
convince the nursemaids that Diggers are
unworthy characters. The idea is that when
this impression has soaked in the young
women will return to their old allegiance at
increased rates of pay based on the H.C.L.

“Palotta” : Strange things are brewing in
the Melbourne State-aided School for
Painters where Bernard Hall gives a certain
amount of teaching. There is discontent
amongst the students, which will perhaps
end in the drawing up of a “circular letter”
to the trustees asking (1) How many years
has Bernard Hall been in sole charge? (2)
How many students have thrown up the
lessons in disgust or otherwise? (3) How
many of those who have doggedly pursued
the course to the end have turned out good
painters? (4) When will it be thought a
fair thing to employ a younger man with
new ideas? From what is being said by
students who have come back from Europe,
a good deal of water has flowed under the
bridges during the last 30 years.
HE KNEW.
MR. UNWED : “A man's plans are nothing,
after all, you know. ‘Man proposes
and’”
MR. MUCH WED (sadly): “The woman
makes him stick to it.”
“Grip”: Dinner always tasted good in
France. One day our cook made a stew
which all pronounced bonzer, and we had
to be warned to leave some for the two lines-
men. They came in late, tired and hungry,
and wired in. When scraping out the dixie
to get the last bit. one of them came across
what appeared to be a bit of string. “What’s
this?” he asked the cook. Cook examined
the find and exclaimed, “Blanked if it ain’t
the wick of the candle I lost this afternoon !”

THE TWO HAPPY MEN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Beer makes you feel as you ought to feel with-
out it.” —David McKee Wright (Philosophical De-
partment).
I heard a joyous yell or two, and, in the busy ’street,
I saw two happy men dance by on light and eager
feet;
Each dancer’s face was wreathed in smiles, and, as
they lightly paced,
One comrade held the other close with one arm
round his waist.
The world was all in tune for them. They had to
whoop for joy,
While sober citizens trudged past upon their dull
employ ;
Some smiled as if to say “Poor fools!" but more
were seen to sneer,
And one or two were scandalised, for it was duo to
beer.
T do not like the roaring drunk, the drunk who falls
asleep,
The mournful, white and dusty drunk who tumbles
in a heap,
The fighting drunk, the slating drunk —I do not
want these near,
But I admire the dancing drunk who passes with
a cheer.
They two-stepped past on New Year’s Eve. No
doubt they’re back again,
Toiling for bread with spade or pen like quiet, sober
men;
But always in my memory they’ll polka down the
year,
A testimonial for the joy that dwells in someone's
beer.

“Timo”: It wasn’t the best job in the
world, that of driver for a firm of carriers;
but having filled it for nine years pre-war
he regarded it as his. After four years’
service there was a welcome home and a few
weeks’ spell, during which he didn’t bother
to go and see about his old job. Then one
Monday morning he got into his working-
togs. strolled into the yard, and, regardless
of the strange faces he met, went round the
horses in their stalls renewing acquaintane 2.
“Old Bluey’s mine,” said the newcomer to
the stableman, pointing to his favorite van-
ner. “I’m making a start this morning.”
Then there had to be an explanation; the
Digger was told that the business had
changed hands since he left, and they already
had quite as many carters as they could find
work for. Digger listened, nodded, and
sauntered into the office. After a look at
the “direction slate” he harnessed Bluey.
At 8 o’clock he was on his way to the wharf
for a load. The firm simply had to give
him his job back. The casual cuss had taken
it.
AS NATURE MADE HIM.
“All your pyjamas are out on the line,
Tommy, so you’ll have to wcar sister’s
nightie for to-night .”
“I won’t. I’d sooner go to bed raw!"
“Gum Leaf”: Slumdom had reared its
ugly head in Sydney as far back as 1842.
Fifty-four building allotments fronting
Regent-street (then Botany-road) were sub-
mitted for auction by a Mr. Stubbs in that
year. Though at that time vast areas of
open spaces surrounded the city, most of
Stubbs’s allotments had a frontage of only
25ft. and a depth of 50ft. The inset plan,
by the way, recalls old Sydney landmarks.
Brewers Tooth and Newenham were in a
paddock near the big beer co.’s present site,
while one Cooper distilled on the spot where
the communion cup is passed round at
St. Benedict’s R. C. Church.

“J.E.W.’s” tale of an “education” scheme:
Directly after the Armistice the Educational Branch
of the Repatriation Department got busy, and schools
were established in France, Belgium and England.
Many Diggers elected to join the Corps Central
School with a view to matriculation, accountancy
or the civil service. The school was on the French
side of the Channel near the small village of St.
Firmin. The site was a wretched one, the wild North
Sea gales paying particular attention to the mis-
cellaneous collection of small Nissen huts, with a
few buildings constructed of packing-cases. Many
of the Diggers, after a few days’ misery, marched
back to their units. One candle issued to last for
two days (it was dark at 4 p.m.) had to serve at
least six men who were supposed to be studying.
Meetings galore were held to protest against the
conditions ; but they had little effect. Eventually we
left France as a special quota with the promise of
a transport on which facilities would be provided
for the continuance of studies. After waiting in
England for over II weeks, and after being allotted
to five different transports, we at last boarded a ship
with scrap-iron for engines and packed with Diggers’
families. Our deck was overcrowded, and it was
due wholly to Professor Wallace, of Melbourne Uni-
versity, that the school kept on its legs at all.
“Hamer”: N. S. Wales Railway Com-
missionersliave bumped
up tramway fares
again, and it is certain
that so bad a bump
wouldn’t b 6 necessary
if they gathered all the
fares that are at pre-
sent chargeable. I
have seen as much as
two jump off
a tram at one time
and vlose itself in the
traffic; and these two
bobs must amount to
tens of thousands in a
year. The go-slow dis-
ease with which some
tram-conductors are
afflicted may be partly
responsible, but with
cars open on both
sides the collection of
all fare% especially
those of intentional
dodgers, is an impos-
sibility. Why do we
maintain this system
while modern services
everywhere have abandoned it?
* * * *
“Trallwm” : A sudden change has come in
the attitude of the more powerful Prote-
stant denominations of Victoria towards
secular education. After years of peevish
advocacy of Scripture in the State schools,
the Anglicans and Presbyterians have
realised that the community is against State
backing of any form of religious teaching,
and are now trying to catch up to their
enterprising R.C. competitors. Within a few
months a dozen established schools in Mel-
bourne, Ballarat, Geelong and smaller pro-
vincial centres have been purchased. More-
over, care is being taken to avoid justify-
ing the old-time gibe that anyone with an
education above the ordinary is good enough
to teach a private school. The prospectus
of one of the youngest of these church “pub-
lic schools,” a girls’ college, gives on its
staff list a master of arts, two bachelors,
three with the State Education Department’s
diploma, four specialists certificated by the
same Department, and five students of Mel-
bourne Uni. This looks like business. For
10s. a week the good Malthusian who has
kept his quiver down to one or two can
obtain the services of this staff and add
piano, elocution, dancing and physical cul-
ture, all by exponents of good standing; and
hundreds of him will do it. The Vic. State-
school system has been acknowledged for
years to be one of the world’s best, and high
and low were glad to make use of it; but It
looks as though the religious bug is going
to give it a shake-up in the next few years.
Incidentally, the Anglicans had hoped from
the fervor for volunteer war work displayed
by the Church’s adherents in running huts,
homes and leagues of soldiers’ friends that
they might have made a bid for primary
education at cheap rates by switching the
war-workers into teaching sisterhoods, but
this hope has wilted on the stalk.
“Te Babarantiko” discourses on tropical
diseases: —-
The forthcoming investigation of tropical diseases
in the Gilbert and Ellice groups will be the first
comprehensive medical examination of the inhabitants
of the islands of the Central Pacific. Both groups
have their quota of ailments, but true malarial and
blackwater fevers, which make other of the richest
groups in the Pacific a trial to most white residents,
appear to be absent. A rare but dangerous fever,
differing somewhat from its malarial variety, is
present on Ocean Island (Banaba), contiguous to
the Gilbert group. It is known as “island fever,”
and leaves its victim a worse wreck than true
malaria. A similar fever on Pleasant Island (Nauru)
may be accounted for by the freshwater lagoon
there. Yet, although each of the Gilbert and Ellice
atolls has also either a brackish lagoon or extensive
freshwater swamps, during many years’ residence I
have not known of any case of fever contracted by
whites, and fever among the natives is rare.
Both groups have filarial troubles. In certain
of the Ellice islands elephantiasis is prevalent
among the natives; but in the Gilberts it is prac-
tically unknown. Leprosy is present in both groups.
In the Ellices the tokelau scale is more prevalent
than in the Gilberts, where, however, a skin-trouble
called te broubrou is unpleasantly common.
Dysentery is not prevalent except during the
paudanus fruit season. Urinary troubles are ever
present owing to the brackish, calcareous drinking
water, and perhaps because of the drinking of acid
young eocoauut milk and the sap of the palm from
which countless beetles are strained. In changes to
rainy and windy weather pulmonary troubles be-
come virulent, resulting frequently in consumption,
which is passed onward by the habit of circulating
the common smoking-pipe from the sick bed where
a crowd is always in attendance.
Elephantiasis has claimed white victims in both
the Ellice and the Gilbert groups. Leprosy, also,
has killed white men in each. A peculiar paralysis
WHEN LOVE IS BLIND.
“Stiff lack for the Lovejims—rained all the
time they were on their honeymoon!"
“For shame, Cecil—to think that one would
notice such a thing at such a time!"
of the legs, most difficult to combat even with the
strychnine treatment, also attacks whites and
Chinese. This paralysis resembles an affliction in
the North-west Pacific Islands, which comes sud-
denly and departs in from a couple of hours to as
many days; but in the Gilberts the attack continues
for months, sometimes for years. Yet the Gilbert and
Ellice islands and the Marshalls, where similar con-
ditions obtain, are healthier than most Oceanic
clusters.
• • • *
This is a Macquarie-street view of it: —
The days of the convict garb have long passed
away, but the clank of chains can still be heard in
the freak amendments of the Medical Act that were
rushed through both Houses in the Speck. They
are outrages on the liberty of the most self-sacrificing
profession in the world, and deserve wide pub-
licity in order that they may be held up to public
ridicule. One of the absurdities hopes to fine a
doctor £lOO if he declines to meet another doctor
in consultation when called upon. Another one
makes it a penal offence for any body or associa-
tion to prevent a doctor accepting an
appointment on the staff of a public
hospital. It is not likely that the
profession will be frightened by this
gigantic bluff put up by ignorant
legislators. It will be easy enough
to dodge being called into consulta-
tion. A previous engagement or a
bad confinement on hand will be all
that is necessary, and unless the
medico whose opinion is sought gives
a point-blank refusal the Law will
be unable to touch him. As for de-
registration, or imprisonment, for
obeying the rules of medical conduct
laid down by the B.M.A. rather than
the freak regulations of every jack-in-
office who is grossly ignorant of medi-
cal matters, that design, if put into
action, would merely precipitate a
general strike, which would be disas-
trous to the community. The Speck
couldn’t do without doctors for any
length of time, and the Government
would soon return to a reasonable
frame of mind. The whole matter is
very unedifying, and shows the hos-
tility with which the profession is
regarded by certain brands of legis-
lators. The insertion of a clause in
the Vic. Health Bill whereby returned men and
others who accept Government or municipal health
billets are required to attend to lodge patients in
their spare time is a case in point, and is bound
to lead to trouble. It is to be hoped that members
of the Vic. branch of the B.M.A. will turn such
jobs down. Everyone else expects a fair show
these times. Why should the doctors be left out?

“Don Three”: The Diggers were cham-
pions at souvenir huntings After the Armis-
tice we were camped near Tornette, and the
citizens desired to do us honor, having an
idea that we had saved their town. It was
decided that a mayoral reception to the
brigade would fill the bill, and we all received
invitations. We were to march up to the
Hotel de Ville and file past the Mayor, who
was to shake each Digger by the hand, and
afterwards join us in the square, where re-
freshments were to be provided. The great
day came, and there stood his Worship fully
robed, a chain of office around his neck; and
the councillors behind him like stars around
the sun. All went well for a while. Then
the orderly-officer broke it to the Colonel:
“For Heaven’s sake, sir, do something—one
of the boys has pinched the Mayor’s chain!”
From a Sydney consulting room :
The re. ent decision of the members of the
A.T.N.A. to increase their fees from three to four
guineas per week is a step in the wrong direction,
and will bring disaster to the pockets of that useful
profession in the long run. The step is said to
have been suggested by nurses from the Western
Front who have brought back grandiose ideas from
“Frarnce,” as they delight to call it. Before the
war the fees were two guineas, with an additional
guinea if the case was infectious. This was reason-
able ; but during the war there was a general rise
to three guineas, and even that came hard upon
many households. As, in addition to their fees,
the nurses get taxi- or cab-fares, and board and
lodging, including washing, which is equivalent to
another two guineas per week, a patient will now
have to pay at least £lO per week for the privilege
of being sick, assuming that Sawbones comes only
once a day and charges ten-and-six per visit. God
knows what it will run the patient into if there
is anything wrong with, say, his blood pressure, or
if he be “specialed”—that is, if two of the guild,
one for day and one for night duty, are necessary.
The remedy is the opening up of cheap suburban
private hospitals where the patient could get every
comfort for three or at most four guineas per week.
St. Luke’s anti St. Vincent’s both cater for patients
at these rates. Until such hospitals are general the
sight of a nurse’s uniform will bring consternation to
the average householder instead of comfort. Consider-
ing that the “screw” of a country hospital matron
(Orange, for example) is only £l3O per annum,
and that probationers are available by the score
at the magnificent salary of £29 per annum, the
sudden jump to £2lB Bs. per annum for private
nurses seems at least a blazing anomaly.
“D.T.”: Brown, O.C. Signals, was a
great believer in pigeons, asserting that a
pigeon would get through with a message
when all other means had failed. Soon after
their arrival with a draft from England,
Eric and his cobber Robbie were detailed to
a hop-over with the infantry ; and dawn saw
them ready to set off, loaded to Plimsoll
with telephones, reels of cable, lamps and
other impedimenta. Brown emerged from
his dugout to impress upon them the im-
portant part they were to play in the opera-
tions. Then he paused, stricken with aston-
ishment. “My God!” he gasped, “are you
going without pigeons?” A messenger was
hastily despatched to the loft, .the omission
rectified, and the two set off for the front

they returned, and once more faced Brown.
Eric explained that their lines were
repeatedly cut, and that they had been
unable to' send messages through. “Then
why the hell didn’t you use the pigeons?”
he roared. “Oh, the pigeons?” Eric replied
with a grateful smile. “We ate them, thank
you, sir.”
CASTLE OF DREAMS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Is this the thing we dreamed, the tale you told,
When, in an ecstasy of still delight,
M e watched the sea-line where a full moon rolled
Into the lap of Night?
What was it that you said and Love devised?
“A wonder loom where just we two could go
And sit and dream, while books we loved and prized,
Gleamed in the firelight low!”
Of winter nights, and hues rose-candles fling
On silken curtains drawn against the grey!
How you would play, as none but I could sing,
Your French songs sad and gay !
Of other nights when through my hair like mist
The tender tribute of your lips was set;
Of honeyed words that trembled as they kissed,
And we lay dreaming yet!
This attic room is all we won from Life—
How bleak the careless wind goes whistling by!
Playthings of Fate, tossed in a city’s strife,
Beloved, you and 1!

“Werrimee” : An interesting spectacle often
witnessed now in the bush is the catching of swarms
of wild bees. Nobody bothered with them much a
few years ago, when bush dwellers who desired honey
wanted only an axe and a bucket to get it; but
bee values have soared since then, and a swarm is
worth running down. The hum of a travelling
mob can be heard even when the bees are so far
up that they can’t be seen. There is no mistaking
the sound. As soon as the alarm is given there is
an excited rush for tin-kettling instruments, and
the whole family sallies forth, running to keep
under the swarm and banging tin dishes, kerosene-
tins and such-like melodious contrivances as it goes.
When tile bees fly low enough water is thrown among
them and the flight is over. They quickly bunch on
a bush or low limb where they can be boxed. They
don’t like stormy or wet weather, and it is said they
mistake the noise of the tin-can band for thunder,
and when water begins to sprinkle them they are
sure their weather forecaster has made a blunder
and dive for the nearest roost.

“Delhi”: This year’s drought in N. S.
Wales is perhaps the most disastrous on record, and
stockowners are looking forward to the first few
weeks after its real break-up with added dread.
After the recent storms on the eastern slopes the
cattle that were weak from starvation ate the
young herbage developed a black scour. The
disease sent them down, and they died like flies;
and greater losses will be experienced after heavy
rain.
* * * *
“Bad Australian”: It is not generally
known, but it’s true nevertheless, that big Murray
cod when closely pursued scoot into hollow logs,
and the smaller fry, when alarmed at the approach
of an enemy, bore into sandy ground almost as
rapidly as a porcupine does into an anthill. The
catfish in similar circumstances appears to depend
on his superior velocity and dexterity in turning.
The “yellow belly” (golden perch), like the hare,
“logs” only in the last extremity.
* * * *
“Gouger”: Was introduced to a cousin of
the bower-bird recently. It was brown-backed, wore
a white waistcoat with brown spots, had big black-
eyes and a piercing but musical call. Two of them
had scratched clean a circular patch amidst the foot.-
depth of rank leaves in dense Cape York Peninsula
jungle. In even lines on this patch the birds had
placed fresh green leaves, and were dancing and
singing by turns. One would pick up a leaf in
its bill, caper around in a circle and then return
the leaf to the spot where lie had picked it up. Im-
mediately its mate would break into loud and
enthusiastic applause at the performance, making
the jungle ring with its echoing notes. Then he
would take his turn at the dance. But the “house”
came down when one of the artists was caught on
a lawyer-vine and hung head downward in the air.
Talk about excitement 1
* * * *
“Eddyson”: The main and only street of
Cowbell, Gippsland, runs right down to
the river. It ceases to be a street, it is
true, long before it gets half-way there,
but the faithful inhabitants point out the
illimitable opportunities of expansion that
Cowbell enjoys. It was the Saturday
morning after our arrival, close upon
the hour of noon, that Henry Tell came
rushing up from the river bridge, gesti-
culating and shouting as he came. There
was no one in particular to take any
note of Tell’s peculiar conduct, Cowbell
being in its familiar condition of coma, a
condition that has earned it the reputa-
tion of the tiredest township this way
from the equator. On came Tell, bound-
ing with the impetuosity of a youthful
kangaroo, and brandishing his hat as a
danger signal as he ran. His yells awoke
Bunder, who was sleeping pff something
taken last night that had disagreed with
his head. Bunder dragged himself to a
reclining position against the verandah
post, and watched Tell’s advance incuri-
ously. Tell arrived. “Carfield’s boy Billy,”
he gasped—“he’s in the river pool. He’s
drowndin’ ! Come on, can’t yeh ? Help
me do somethin’.” Bunder looked down
the road, he looked up the road. Two
hundred yards off Jessop’s team of eight
drawing a big load of sawn timber came
creaking down the road, heading for the
river bridge. “Come on!” squealed Tell.
“ ’Old ’ard. ’Old’ ard,” replied Bunder
in a tone of reproof. “Here comes Jessop’s jinker.
He’ll give us a lift.”
* * * *
“Mulga”: If the flame- or coral-tree men-
tioned by “A.W.0.” (B. 4/12/’l9) is any harder
to kill than the white ti-tree that abounds in the
brigaiow and belah scrubs of Southern Queensland, I
will hand it the belt. I have seen thousands of
acres of this ti-tree felled and burned off, then the
stumps burnt off for cultivation purposes, but the fires
only seemed to give a new lease of life to the plant.
I know one selector who rung and bored holes in
a number of the trees into which he inserted a
mixture of arsenic and caustic-soda. For a while
the vegetables so treated appeared to be as dead as
an Egyptian mummy; then they sprouted again
as vigorously as ever. The only way I know to
kill this tree is to grub it out.
* * * #
“Winner”: I’m entering three Aroma
(Papua) boys for the eat stakes. These three nigs,
“shooty boys” at the Laloki mine, consumed, during
the absence of the boss, one 601 b. bag of rice
(stolen), three full-grown m’gani (wallabies) and
one 7ft. 6in. carpet-snake. It took them from 4
o’clock one evening until 10 next morning to com-
plete the gorge. I submit that this certainly takes
what, the niggers got when the boss returned —some
beating.
“Pongo”: Re the proper time for felling
timber. To get the best results trees should be put
to the axe whilst the sap is down. This opinion is
shared by 99 p.c. of lumber men, wood butchers
and others of first-hand experience. “J.G.’s” state-
ment in a recent Bulletin that it is the grain that
counts won’t go with them. The grain of timber is
determined by the peregiinations of the taproot. Fir
instance, timber grown in alluvial soil will be
MA NOT REQUIRED.
CLARIBEL : “Are you sure, Richard, that your whole being calls out for me alone?"
RICHARD: “Yes, darling, quite alone."
straight and free in the grain, whilst that grown in
rocky ground will be curled and show a good figure.
The seasoning of timber is the vital matter. It can
be done in the manner set out by “Melos” (B.
16/10/’l9), but there is a better way, and that is
to stand the wood on end; but it is a costly arnd
difficult job. The practice of dumping the logs
into water is much followed in parts of Banana-
land, and is an excellent one if the water is run-
ning. Dumping logs into the sea is of no use, as
the water simply soaks into the wood. In a stream
the water goes through the log from end to end and
carries the sap with it. Timber felled in spring
or summer will crack, shrink and twist; and “J.G.’s”
statement that he has never seen or heard of a
piece of timber split or sawn from a winter-felled
tree being superior to that of the same kind of
wood from a spring-felled tree is nonsense.
* * * *
“Delhi”: “Pick” (B. 4/12/’l9) is wrong
when he states that a kookaburra will tackle any
snake. I have studied kookaburras for years, and
have never known them to attack a snake of any
kind over 3ft. long. Also I have seen jackasses
sheer off like a woman from a tiger-snake 2ft. long.
Only once, too, have I seen a fight to a finish, and
in this case it was the bird that was finished.
* * * *
“Haragigi”: It takes a lot to puzzle a
Papuan magistrate, but the beak at Port Moresby
was bluffed the other day when a diminutive savage
barged in and laid a complaint against his sinabada
(mistress) for assault. Careful questioning elicited
that “All time sinabada he fight me ’long harness
b’long him.” Nothing surprises one much in Papua
as to what the ladies wear or don’t wear, but the
R.M. could not call to mind any madame who was
addicted to the habit of wearing harness. It trans-
pired that the youth had been caught in the act of
polishing the cutlery on his chest or something, and
his irate missus had bashed him with the first article
that came handy, namely, her corsets, which were in
a salad-bowl on the sideboard.
* # * *
“Riverina”: In the bush a coat, though
rarely worn in summer, plays an important part in
life and language. A man who “doesn’t need to
take his coat off” is one who is financially indepen-
dent or has a soft job. A man who “has his coat
off again” is an unfortunate whose speculations have
ended disastrously. To “put your coat on” is to
“turn the job in” or knock off work. The garment
is carried in hot weather as a receptacle for smoking
material. I have seen men after an argument with
the boss put on their coats when the glass registered
a hundred odd in the waterbag. It means finality,
and is a solemn rite. If a worker can put it on
before a boss “fires” him it creates in the former
an exhilarating sense of victory that no language,
however abusive, can impart.
* * * *
“Jim Carew” ; Have noticed that the Cen-
tral Queensland Binghis when in camp always stick
their spears in the ground butt-end down, and that
they invariably have one leaning due north and one
leaning due south. I have repeatedly asked whaffor,
but have always received an evasive answer. Any
white abo. know?
“Leo Lear” : The Australian barn-owl is
likely to be an extinct bird in Western Victoria,
Some unusual disease seems to have the
species, and they are being picked up dead in all
parts of the district. The bodies I have examined
were merely feathers and bones. The loss of the
birds will be a great misfortune as their food »
mice and rats, which they hunt during the dark
hours. Barney wears a beautiful soft dress of
brown and gray tinged with yellow, while his white
underclothes are spotted black. In the daytime he
gazes at one plaintively from a dark hole or thick
bushy foliage. I am inclined to think the imported
starling, which has invaded all his resting-places, is
somehow connected with his sickness.

“Te Whare” : Some bush housewives make
a jelly, pale yellow in color, from the berries of
the “wild currant.” Eaten with roast sheep it is
excellent. The tender tops of “fat hen” boiled make
a good spinach, while those of the stinging-nettle,
similarly treated, are a blood purifier. The nettle,
by the way, is used in other countries as the basis
of a light, non-tanglefoot beer. I have tasted goose-
berry wine which only needed aeration to make it
fair champagne, while good elderberry wine, taken
neat on a cold, frosty morning, will send the
blood tingling through the veins. If any of these
articles disagree, gather some brooklime (hysson),
boil it, and you have an infusion calculated to dis-

THE SANCTUARY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
By fallen trees and broken gates
An old bush track is leading
Along the banks of green lagoons
Where water-fowl are feeding.
The spoonbill struts amongst the weeds ;
There’s many a crane and plover ;
The wdly birdhawk sits on guard;
The wood-duck flies to cover.
An old mud house is crumbling there —
The stockyard fence is falling—
And from a gum-tree near the dam
A love-bird’s mate is calling.
Across the flat where once grew wheat
A dog-leg fence is reaching
To where the yellow box-trees bloom
And cockatoos are screeching.
Then further on through low pine belts,
Where plain and range are meeting,
The brolgas dance in stately grace,
The jackass laughs a greeting.
The “twelve apostles” hop and skip.
The “happy family’s” chatter
From daybreak till the sun goes down
Is just an endless patter.
Here from a giant kurrajong
Some young galahs are peeping,
And underneath where shades are deep .
Tired kangaroos are sleeping.
There are no camp-fires burning there,
No bushmen’s axes ringing,
The trees are green with yellow blooms
Where parrakeets are swinging.
BEAUTY AND THE BUTCHER.
“ Butcher, those chops which weighed Ilb. on
your scales only weigh 12oz. on mine!"
“Yes, mum, that’s why all the ladies deal
from me, mum. My scales give more
weight than any other set in town.”
Young wattle-trees and scented gums
And native shrubs are sprouting—
There are no sheep to eat them out,
There are no drovers shouting.
The plains are waving with a sward
Of many herbs and grasses,
Where timid quail rise up in flocks
When an intruder passes.
The bronzewing pigeon calls its mate
Just as the sun is sinking
And flies to gilgais in the scrub
Where wallabies are drinking.

Delhi”: “F.W.L.” (B. 4/12/’l9) sup-
ports “Melos” in favor of bloodwood for fencing
purposes. Has he ever seen negro-head? Fifteen
years ago a 30-chain line of posts of this timber
was erected on the Dorrigo (N.S.W.), and the fence
stands to-day as good as the day it was elevated.
Bloodwood makes good posts, but it has not the fire-
resisting qualities of negro-head: and the latter is
the easier to work.
* » * *
“Pick”: “A/.ac” (B. 11/12/’l9) discloses
how some lug shearing tallies are made up—by
counting rams and stags as doubles. Figures are
also sometimes augmented for the big “gun” by
other shearers, in debt to him for two-up or poker,
squaring accounts by throwing their barbered sheep
down his shoot. In the same way a benefit is ten-
dered to a popular but unlucky shearer who has
lost time through illness or injury. At Bibbenluke
(N.S.W.) once I saw 31f> counted to Jack Thomas,
a ringer of those days, for a three-quarter day’s
shearing. The tally was the talk of Monaro until
it became known that all hands had thrown in to
him their after-smoko run. Nevertheless, tall scores
are sometimes honestly compiled off the shearer’s
own comb. At Willeroo this year Jack Tobin shore
317 crossbred lambs —and big fellows at that —in
one day. Subsequently, at the adjoining station,
Gurrandooley, in 14 days’ shearing, he did over 200,
big or little, every day. His total for the fortnight
was 2964 —highest tally 272, lowest 204. And Our-
randoolev is a place where they don't permit toma-
hawking !
“Tharon”: “Pick’s” assertions (B.
27/11/T9) regarding the nulla-nulla need adjust-
ment. This weapon was essentially a club, and
was used with deadly effect in big abo. stunts. It
was only brought into use when spears and boom-
erangs had been expended at long range. “Pick’s”
evidence regarding the shape and make of the nulla
proves him guilty of having seen one somewhere, but
lie is out of line otherwise. No sane blackfellow
would fling his coveted nut-cracker at a tree, log or
stump, at the rate of a hundred miles an hour, with
the idea of its then rebounding to an object. Let
“Pick” have a go himself, and after a lifetime of
practice I’ll bet him a hen’s elbow to a feed of
bully-beef that he will be about as proficient at the
cannoning business as a Chinaman is at tossing off
long-sleevers.
* * * *
“Haragigi”: Apropos “Bill the Hangman,”
lately paragraphed, this is another story of what
happened when he got his name. “I under-
stand, Pritchard, that ye are willin’ to hang these
men,” said Macgregor. “I am, sir,” answers Bill.
“And how much would ye be charging for the job,
Pritchard?” “Five pounds apiece, sir,” says the
bos’n. “Man, in Fiji I never paid niair than twa-
poon’-ten!” objected the Governor, always with an
eye to the revenue. “I never hanged a man for
fifty bob in me life,” says Bill —-which was perfectly
true. His Ex. didn’t haggle any further. The exe-
cution and the “jag” which followed are still remem-
bered by the old hands at Samarai. “Bill the Hang-
man” perished from diver's paralysis which came
upon him in the China Straits.

“Honey Bee” : Is there a wild Monsteria
delict os a growing in Queensland? The cultivated
species I’ve seen has perforated leaves and is inclined
to be a creeper. The kind I found in Mackav
(Q.) —dozens of them —are true climbers, some of
them reaching 30ft. up the palms and sending out.
leaves and fruit two or three times on the stem.
Another difference is that the perforations are con-
tinued right out to the edges of the leaves, making
splits of them. In the same scrub I saw a swamp-
pheasant kill a 4ft. black snake. Didn’t know before
that the pheasant was worth his salt in that line.
AWFUL ALTERNATIVE.
MURPHY: “Phwat! Is it six bob ye’re after

CABBY : “If yes think it’s too much, yes can

“Jim Carew”: When two hard-case native-
bears meet in the same tree there is generally a
row before sundown; and the scrap is one of the
best sights the bush affords. I recently had the
luck to witness a daisy rough-up. First, the bears
sat on their haunches on their respective branches.
Then, snarling at each other, they started down the
tree, head-first —the only time I ever saw a bear
IN THE ANCESTRAL HALLS OF COWLAND.

come down a tree head-first. Meeting at a fork
about 15ft. from the ground they fairly flew at each
other, fighting like dog's, filling the air with a
queer mixture of snorts and squeals, until, locked
together, they fell to the ground. There they let
each other go and scrambled back to the fork of
the trunk for the second round. A minute of or later
they bumped the ground again. Once more they
scrambled up the tree, taking different directions,
snorting violently at each other a few times, and
let it go at that. I unanimously gave them three
Australian cheers.
* • * *
“Centurion” : According to British figures
the wastage of horses in the great cavalry campaign
of the war —in Sinai and Palestine —was only 25
per cent., which borders on the miraculous, consider-
ing the nature of much of the country worked over.
The statement should finally dispel the legend, be-
loved of “regular” officers since the South African
war, that the Australian is the rottenest horse-
master in the world. Up to the end of the campaign
in Sinai the Australians had the field to themselves,
though later British, Indian and Allied cavalry came
into the game in increasing numbers. Apart from
the blooded quality of the Australian mounts, much
of their success is, in my opinion, due to the fact
that the Gallipoli campaign gave the animals a
chance to become acclimatised. They had nearly 12
months to get used to climatic conditions and un-
accustomed foods and then two or three months of
regular work before the really hard stuff began.
Compare that with the trials of the Australian prads
in South Africa, where they were often on trek a
week after they came off the transports. No wonder
the wastage was so heavy! Many of the horses of
the British regiments, such as the Westminster
Dragoons and those of the Indian cavalry, had also
long preliminary spells in Egypt, which doubtless
had its share in keeping the four-legged fighters’
casualties so low.
* * * *
“Camolero”: There’s nothing on this
planet that will shift a camel once it goes on strike.
I reckon I am entitled to speak as an authority, as
I spent three years wandering over Sinai and Pales-
tine with the Camel Corps. I’ve seen the brutes
lie down when on the march and the application
of rhino, whips, military boots and uprooted date-
palms failed to move them. As a last resort a
Digger once lit a fire under his smellful steed, but
there was nothing doing. When the oont took it into
his grub-infested brain to stop work the wisest
thing the Digger could do was to rope the brute's
legs, unroll his blanket and have a sleep.
“llawkesbury”: Just now the bush
vibrates with the defeaning zing-zing-zing of myriads
of cicadas; up to a dozen have come up from the
roots of one of my citrus-trees through auger-like
holes in the ground. The purple meat-ants have
the time of their lives; finding a cicada beating
his drum, they swarm over him and fasten on his
eyes. The monster is soon blinded, and thus made help-
less while his edible parts are devoured. His death
is slow, and for some time you can watch him creep-
ing aimlessly about carrying a clinging load of
his enemies. This is also a day out for the hole-
digging hornet, who captures and paralyses the
cicada as her mud-ccll-building cousin does the
Spider. Turning her prey on its back —it is far
too heavy for carriage—she gets astride its abdomen,
and, holding it with her hind legs, tugs forward
at a good pace with her four free legs. As though
shaped for the purpose, the prey thus travels
backwards on its bade. Why does the cicada make
his uproar ? Primitive perceptions said: “To attract
his mate.” But Lubbock and Fabre have proved (as
they thought) that insects have no hearing. Besides,
the lady cicada is usually close to the male. Now,
a lover does not shout through a foghorn to his
girl on the same seat. Nor can one agree with
Fabre that Nature has evolved a highly-specialised
sound-instrument for simple Hallelujah purposes. Yet
there are admirers of these bush joy-gongs, as there
are those liking the row of train, tram and motor-
car. One draws the inference that even the howls
in Hades will be comforting when you have heard
them long enough.
“Melos”: There are some strange vege-
tables in the brush forests of the N. S. Wales North
Coast. One, a small, Straggling tree, common enough
on the Clarence, was the subject of much discussion
among English and Continental savants some years
ago owing to its habit of reproducing itself from
seed through several generations from female plants
aloim—that is, without the intervention of male
flowers. Many specimens were taken to England. So
also were numbers of a magnificent tree-fern,
Cyathea medullaris , found about the Richmond. This
species grows to a height of about 50ft., and sports*
fronds of from 10 to 20 feet. In the same quarter
flourishes the remarkably handsome “red-apple,” a
tree with a trunk as straight as a gun-barrel and a
beautiful bunchy top. Its fruit resembles a red
guava, and has an agreeable perfume and taste.
Another rare but interesting resident is an ever-
green climber, with large, purple blooms .and great
pods. The wood when punctured yields a red, resin-
ous and astringent fluid which Dr. Binghi says is a
sovereign remedy for pain under the waistcoat.
* -X- * *
“Delhi”: Is “Aneb” (B. 4/12/T9) joking
when he recommends galvanised piping for maul-
handles ? The handle must have spring in it unless
it is operated by a man with wooden hands. If
“Aneb” wants a real handle let me recommend
water-gum. Incidentally, in the case of maul-head
I would never bother putting rings on anything tut
ironbarlc.
“Bilby”: I exchanged a plug of tobacco*'
for the secret, and Binghi swore that if properly
applied the lure would work in any waters. Cap-
ture a crocodile and extract the strong musk-smelling
material which is secreted in the glands below the
reptile’s throat. Place a particle of this on the
bait and the fish will rush it with their fins back.
Binghi says it is this odor that attracts the fish on
which the reptiles feed. While I’m searching for a
crocodile perhaps some other Abo.-liar will hop in
and tell me what he thinks of the idea.
“Te Whare”: The big brown chafer-beetle
with greenish wing-reflections is around again seeking
what he may devour. Incidentally, he is stripping
gum-trees in the Bega (N.S.W.) district of leaves,
while on him the vdiite-eyebrowed wood-swallow
(which arrives punctually in beetle season) is glut-
tonously feeding. Cuckoos, dusky wood-swallows,
laughing-jacks and magpies assist at the banquet,
but the “chocks” are doing most of the gorging.
Strange how these beetles die after the brief court-
ship, honeymoon, and deposit by the female of her
eggs in damp soil. Yet they do, and they lie dead
and dying-—mostly under the gum-trees they have
defoliated —in thousands. And in death as in life the
beetle Romeo and Juliet are not divided. I forgot
to mention that the domestic hen ambles solemnly
around and takes her full share of these insects, but
a too-liberal diet of beetle gives hen-fruit an un-
pleasant flavor. The noise made by the chafers, by
the way, as they buzz around in millions about dusk,
is like the sound of a coming gale.
AND SHE DOESN’T LIKE IT THICK.
BUTCHER: “ Tes, madam.”
OLD LADY : “Sixpenn’orth of dorg's meat,
please, and don’t drop it in the saw-
dust —I want it for soup.”
“Choice Bore” : We were wallaby shooting
in heavy fern-gullies with two clogs, one of which
was belled with a light sheep-bell. While working
an extra-heavy patch I was surprised to hear two
bells ringing distinctly, about 20 yards apart. I
had almost made up my mind to sign the pledge,
when a cock lyre-bird ran across an open patch and
solved the mystery. It was the finest exhibition of
mimicry I have ever heard.
THE DROUGHT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
John Mattcrson looked o’er his land,
And saw it lying brown and bare.
The fierce north wind he tested, and
lie sniffed the sheep decaying there;
Upon his roof he saw a rude,
Red ape of fearful magnitude.
All night he lay awake to hear
The low of dying beasts; all night
He felt a cold, uncanny fear
As though some thing of godless might
Were creeping over hill and dell,
The herald of eternal hell.
Green fiends were dancing in the smoke;
Swart imps were swinging in the trees.
The red ape on his roof awoke,
And gibbered evil melodies;
And John ran in the wind again
And jumped where fell the sheeted rain.
The fresh swelled in the creek ; the holes
Were brimming with the golden flood.
Still squeaked the ape. With eyes like coals
The Devil burned him where he stood ;
And John knew well that Satan’s flame
Would dry the land ere morning came.
He ran, and in the pool that fed
The blasted orchard wallowed deep.
They found him in an arid bed
Where blazed the sun in death’s cold Sleep.
Low in a hole as dry as delf
John Matterson had drowned himself!

A wonderful example of the savings
possible by Oxy-Acetylene Welding.
ABOVE, on the right, you see a typical instance of what often
happens with heavy pieces of machinery from overseas.
' Rough weather sometimes does the damage—other times it’s
an accident when unloading on the wharf.
It was a problem what to do with the bases of these engines until
the Sydney Oxy-Acetylene Welding Co., Brisbane Street, Sydney,
came on the scene. The rest was easy! Above you see one of
many of these big castings which have been made strong as new
by Oxy-Acetylene Welding— a perfect fusion of the two big broken
sections into one homogeneous whole. The variety of metal repairs
handled by Oxy-Acetylene Welders is remarkable—take them a
broken automobile frame, a plough, or a small pair of scissors. In
every case the cost of repair will be a trifle compared with the
price of a new section or new article. Write for Booklet and
address of your nearest Oxy-Acetylene Welder.

Tango and Fox Trot. But they are strangely
of place, obvious interpolations like a
sulk patch on a pair of . tweed trousers. The
author, Edward Scott, of Rochester House
Hove, writes of his Art in the grand man-
ner throughout. He is a classicist. Sallust,
Herbert Spencer, Schiller, Dr. Johnson,
Southey, Emerson, Socrates and many other
great men of the past are quoted in support
ot his views on the right way to behave in
His standard is high, elevated,
Alpine. Keep quiet and listen:—
A man occupying a very good position in Society
came to me a short time since for a lesson in
waltzing. He had already, he stated, taken several
lessons of a London teacher, who shall, of course, be
nameless here. “1 was advised,” quoted he, “by a
friend to go to Mr. , who had, he informed me,
an excellent reputation, and of whom he had, himself,
received instruction.” “And have you not profited by
the lessons?” 1 inquired. “Well,” replied my visi-
tor, . I do not doubt that Mr. ■ understands
dancing and the teaching of dancing well enough;
but somehow I am under the impression that he is
not accustomed to teaching gentlemen, and I thought
I would like to know if the style in which he
taught me to valse was the correct style.” With
that I proceeded to give him the desired instruc-
tion, and when I discovered in what manner he had
been taught to hold his .partner, to bend his knees,
to rise and fall on his tpcs, and to accentuate the
rhythm with the movements of his body I at once
perceived the justice of his observation. There was
positively nothing wrong with the steps; even the
action of the body was not in a sense incorrect; but
there was something about the tout ensemble that
would have appeared altogether out of place in a
drawing-room; and it was fortunate for him that
I was able to get him out of the style before he
exhibited it at a very high-class gathering which
he was about to attend.
The volume is full of similar gems. Our
copy (the Lord only knows why!) from
G. Bell and Sons, Ltd., London.
A Satchel of Books
Records of the South Australian Museum,
Vol. 1., No. 2 (G. Hassell and Son, Adel-
aide). The death of Edward Charles Stir-
ling in March, 1919, robbed the Adelaide
Museum of a distinguished ethnologist, but
this little volume contains a valuable paper
from his pen founded, on a manuscript of J.
G. lieuther and revised and enlarged by
Edgar R. Waite, the present director of the
museum. The paper is on aboriginal “toas”
or direction signs, and of these 20 plates in
color are given. The meaning of the signs
and the nature of the picture language are
matters of absorbing interest, as are also
the legendary stories and religious beliefs
connected with theip.
The Digger on the “Durham,” by Ran-
some T. Wyatt (Penfold and Co., Sydney).
This is about the most elaborate souvenir-
volume of a troopship’s homeward voyage
that has yet appeared. It consists of posters
and lantern-slides actually used on the shin,
with a series of humorous drawings of life
on board. All the drawings are in color, and
most of them are rich in humor. The artist
explains that nothing has been done to them
since they left the ship; and they are all
the better for that.
The Art and Life of Walter Withers
(Alexander McCubbin, Melbourne). This is
another of the small attractive Australian
art books designed to give the general reader
some idea of the life and work of prominent
artists. One picture in the present volume
is produced in color, and a number of
Withers’s best paintings are shown in
photo-blocks. The story of the man and his
artistic growth is told simply and well.
A Challenge, by Maitland Hardyman
(George Allen and Unwin, London). Hardy-
man was born in 1894 and was at Edinburgh
University from 1911 until 1914. In the
first month of the war he enlisted, and six
months later got his commission. In May,
1918, he was lieutenant-colonel, with a.
D.S.O. and an M.C.; and in August of the
same year he was killed in action. It is a
remarkable record ; and this slender volume
contains the verses which the veteran of 24
wrote between the shell-bursts. Here is the
opening piece:—
The young think only of themselves:
Thank God for that.
Mothers for others fret themselves:
Thank God for that.
Nature everywhere is seen
Writing Love in terms of green:
Thank God for that.
We, who cannot reason why,
Yet may put our doubting by ;
If to live or if to die,
Making this alone our cry,
Thank God for that.
There is promise there and a hint of a new
voice. Much of the verse, however, should
not have been collected.
The Whispering Dead, by Alfred Gana-
chilly (Methuen, London). A South
American murder mystery with a flavor of
German intrigue which fails to live up to
its promising title.
jSomads of the North, by J. O. Curwood
(Ilodder and Stoughton, London). A
Canadian story with two animal heroes—a
black-bear cub and Mild, the pup who was
a cross between a Mackenzie hound and an
Airedale. Their varied exploits make livelv
reading.
The Problem Club, by Barry Pain (Col-
lins, London). A 12 months’ record. Every
month the members have a fantastic problem
set for their solution. The first was “to
induce a woman to say to you, ‘You ought
*9 have been a giraffe’ ”; the second,
\Y ithin the space of one hour to kiss upon
the cheek 10 females of the age of court-
ship.” The quaint misadventures accom-
panying the attempts at solution are amus-
ing. The rev. member who won the prize
for the second problem deserved it —he
kissed 10 cats.
Station X, by G. McLeod Winsor (Jen-
kins, London). A fantastic story of inter-
planetary communication. A wireless tele-
phone operator is sent to a secret station
on one of the South Sea Islands. He is
called up by a mysterious voice. Then mes-
sages begin to arrive from Venus. The
Venerian operator describes how the un-
principled Lunarians, realising that the
moon was a dying habitation, projected
themselves across to Mars by force of will
and took possession. . Later the pirates
regret their action and transfer their atten-
tion to the earth. Their powerful men-
tality smothers the Venerian opposition and
they establish a mental rapport with the
Station X man, thus creating a bridge over
which they intend to invade the earth. The
discovery of the danger and the subsequent
fight and destruction of the Lunarians fur-
nishes several thrills. Very readable.
John Dene of Toronto, by Herbert Jen-
kins (Herbert Jenkins, London). This is
another book by the author-publisher who
wrote “Bindle,” and a very bright and in-
teresting bit of comedy it is. There is a
love-story, the material of a detective yarn
runs as an undercurrent, and war problems,
war enthusiasms and German spies are
strewn over the pages. But the work in
the main is an excellent satire on British
ways, and particularlv on the ways of the
Admiralty Office. John Dene is a Canadian
of great wealth who has a wonderful in-
vention to stop submarines. The way in
which he walks over admirals, deals with
Cabinet Ministers and dodges German
spies makes good reading. But the second
half of the book, where the main thrill
should lie, is not as good as the first.
Dressing Gowns and Glue, by Capt. L.
do G. Sieveking, with illustrations by John
Nash (Cecil Palmer and Hayward, Lon-
don). Nonsense verse of some quality by
an airman with D.S.C. after his name; non-
sense drawings, which Max Beerbohm
loudly applauds in a preface, by a man
whose work is itself humorous, apart from
any words that may be tacked to the
sketches. G. Iv. Chesterton contributes a
preface also which he assures us will sound
quite as well if we read it backwards. So
the book is all right, though the laughter is
not loud.
The Inky Way
“Alan Byron”: Hugh Walpole, mentioned
by Tom Skeyhill (B. 27/11/T9), has a
leaning towards length in fiction. He writes
no short stories except in the linked series
“Jeremy” and “The Golden Scarecrow,” but
has in nine years produced nine novels, most
of them massive. He admires Dostoevsky,
and contrives wherever possible to name
“The Brothers Karamazov,” which in the
unabridged English edition runs to 838
pages. In Walpole’s book on Joseph Conrad
he mentions “that amazing and so unjustly '
obscure fiction, ‘The Shadow of a Titan.’ ”
This work, by A. F. Wedgwood, is amazing
only for its long-windedness. One wonders
whether the limitations imposed by war will
have any effect on these verbose novelists of
1909 to 1913. It is only fair to say that
Walpole, while lengthy, is not prolix; and
inasmuch as he gives two novels for the
price of one, he is preferable to the brethren
who protract one novel to the length of two.
“J.F.H.” (London) : Any Australian inky-
wayfarers entering for the Journalistic
Diploma of the University of London? Ap-
plications are reported to have been received
from all parts of the Empire, as well as from
foreign countries. The first class of 100 stu-
dents, mostly demobilised young warriors, has
been enrolled, and the initial course of lec-
tures mapped out. Owen Seaman, editor of
Punch, is to discourse on “Parody” ; Hartley
Withers, editor of the Economist, on “Jour-
nalism and Finance” ; J. C. Squire, editor of
the New Statesman, on “Journalists’ Eng-
lish” ; W. L. Courtney, reviewer of the DAinx
Telegraph, on “Ancient Literary Critics,
Robert Donald, the new editor of the CLOBL,
bn “Tendencies in Presejit-day Journalism ,
A. B. Walkley, the Times tlieatrennan, on
“Dramatic Criticism”; J. L. Garvin, ecut
of the Observer, on “The Press and B oreign
Aifairs” ; A. J. Gardiner, late editor ot tne
Daily News, on “Some Pitfalls of Journal-
ism” ; and J. A. Spender, editor ot tne
Westminster Gazette, on “The Art ana
Craft of the Leader Writer.”
Writing of the way in which the monotony
of Turkish prison-camps caused men to read,
write and think, Alan Bott notes in Black-
wood the achievement of an Australian at
Afion-Kara-Hissar. This camp, like various
others, was well supplied with books sent
from England, and the prisoners found solid
tomes (Gibbon, Lamartine, Plutarch and
many later authors) much more to their
taste than fictional froth. The Australian,
says Bott, “made a very thorough study ot
the ancient civilisations of the Middle East,
and could supply accurate information, with-
out reference to a book, about every', phase
of the rise and fall of Babylon and Nineveh,
of the Medes and Persians, of the Chal-
deans and Assyrians, with the extent and
location and customs and conquests of the
various empires. Yet he confessed that
three years earlier, at a time when he was
flying in Mesopotamia, he had no more
interest in Babylon than in Nashville, Ten-
nessee.” Nebuchadnezzar and Belshazzar
and those other ancient birds have a lot to
thank the war for. With a bit of luck they 11
be famous yet.
“Plutarch”: In an autobiography lately
issued, "As a Tale tnat is Told,” BYederic W.
Macdonald, Methodist minister, and formerly
president of the Conference of his church,
tells, among other things, of his childhood as
the only boy in a parsonage among a crowd
of girls. Both his father and his grand-
father were preachers. One of the girls
married J. Lockwood Kipling—a man of
some artistic and literary ability, an
authority on Indian art. and afterwards the
father of Rudyard Kipling. Another mar-
ried the artist Burne-Jones, and a third be-
came the wife of Poynter, the Royal
Academy president who died recently. Kip-
ling’s mother showed early literary tastes,
dictating at the age of seven “The History
of the Piebald Family” (this at a. time
when Mrs. Sherwood’s exemplary “History
of the Fairchild Family” was still found in
every reputable nursery). Some of her
verse has appeared in “Hand in Hand,” a
volume published in collaboration with her
daughter, Mrs. Fleming. The engagement
to Lockwood Kipling was agreed upon at
Lake Rudyard, near Burslem, where the
Macdonalds lived; hence R.K.’s name. F. W.
Macdonald, who has written pleasantly on
bookish subjects, is remembered as having
visited Australia, and he has also seen .some-
thing of America. One of his stories in the
present volume tells of a San Francisco
citizen’s reply to the expression of a hope
that a certain thief and murderer would be
hanged. “Sir,” he said, “in order to be
hanged here you need a good deal of in-
fluence with the Government.”

“Ooson”: After wasting a day of expen-
sive time over his Housing and Reclamation
Bill, Vie. Premier Lawson abandoned it.
His idea was to finance the building and
owning of houses by workers earning less
than £350 per annum, the maximum amount
to be spent on house and land being £O5O.
Lawson’s idea was laudable, but its details
were faulty. Ilis bill should have been
entitled a Measure for the Encouragement
of Profiteering by Brick Companies and
Timber Merchants. At present the Mel-
bourne citizen who sets about getting a
house built has an. exciting time. He has
to pay extortionate prices for the bricks,
and then wait from three to six months
before he gets them. It is much the same
with timber and everythin® else, including
labor. Besides the regular builders who
are erecting houses for private citi-
zens, the Commonwealth Bank is build-
ing soldiers’ homes; the Credit Fon-
der assists the worker to build; and
the War Service Homes Commission is
also bogging in. This latter entity has
apparently said au revoir to its reason. It
is limited to an outlay of £7OO on each
soldier’s home, including the land, but it
buys all its bricks from the Brick Combine,
and it is paying 20s. a day to bricklayers
and 16s. a day to laborers, while the Wages
Board rates are 14s. and 12s. This is all
right for the bricklayers, the Brick Com-
bine and the timber men, but if the soldier’s
house is to stop short as soon as the £7OO
is spent, a lot of him will go without a roof,
windows and other luxuries.

“Ato”: I put in a night at one of the
biggest coffee-palaces in Melbourne last
week. Coming down to the lift in the
morning I saw on the landing about three
dozen empty beer bottles. “Where’d they
come from?” I asked the lift-boy. We got
confidential. “We collect up to 10 dozen
empties from the bedrooms every morning,”
he told me. “It’s a dull day when I don’t
earn five bob for dead marines.” The dry
wowser has driven the late drinker to
cover. Next problem is how to prevent him
carrying booze home in anything but his
stomach.

“Hamer” : The habitual debtor has a new
worry in N. S. Wales, where the Petty
Debts Courts may now deal with claims up
to £5O. There will be a run on blue paper
in consequence. Previously the relentless
creditor had to sue for such amounts in the
District Court, and the involved procedure
was a deterrent. Of course the Petty Debts
jurisdiction yields in many cases a very bar-
ren victory: unless the debtor has something
on which the soulless creditor can distrain,
and the latter knows where to find it, the
plaintiff gets a verdict and finds that he still
lias to pay his costs. On the other hand,
the man who disobeys an order of the Dis-
trict Court for the payment of a debt goes
to gaol for “contempt” ; and that is why, for
their contemptuous poverty, a large number
of the men who are in prison get there.

“Arthur R.” : In a recent experiment with
the Baudot system of automatic telegraphy,
which, it is forecasted, will eventually dis-
place the Wheatstone system at present
operating in Australia, a single wire was
made to carry 12 messages simultaneously.
The limit for Australia is four messages at
the same time, and then the working is not
satisfactory.
“Chev.”: Thank goodness the Australian
cow-king begins to see a little further than
the manufacture of butter! The North Coast
(N.S.W.) Co-op. Co. has approved of a
proposal to commence the manufacture of
casein from buttermilk. This is a step in
advance of the Maoriland dairymen, who
have sent five representatives to the United
States to study methods of manufacturing
by-products.

An Australian banker from the U.S.A.:— -
Although they have the gold, the New York
bankers will be unable to hold the financial primacy,
because they lack Britain’s shipping supremacy and
vast oversea dominions. The rate of exchange will
not become normal for years. Meanwhile, to save
losing 16s. Bd. in the £ of the money lent to
Europe, America mu strain herself to lend more
good money to save a lot of bad. Their banking
system is incongruous, and the control of the pub-
lic’s surplus funds by a multitude of small unsound
banks is a serious financial weaknes. They have no
great savings banks like ours.
Outside a few big firms like the Standard Oil, the
Meat Trust and Ford’s, there is really no efficiency in
the United States, although their papers and them-
selves constantly prate about it. American hustle
is hot air. A business man surrounds himself with
dozens of telephone- lines and talks incessantly to
bis neighbors. To vary this, he rushes out of his
office to the nearest big hotel corridor, talks loudly
for an hour, and violently runs back to his chair.
Hustle! a word put to much ignoble use. After
all, they’re just human like ourselves, neither
shrewder nor cleverer, and not nearly so well
educated. Business men there don’t trust one
another tlje way we do, for they have no faith.
Everything they sell is “free on board, cash against,
documents.” Every Australian firm, big or little,
buying shoddy clothes, motor-cars, iron or timber,
must open a letter of credit in an American bank or
remit cash. If they want the world’s trade, and
especially the trade of South America, the Yankees
must learn to take risks and drop the stupid “cash
before delivery” system.

THE real comparison on this job is to see whether your lathe equipment could do it.
If it can’t, then every day you delay getting a Gisholt Turret Lathe means loss of
money. Not only did the Gisholt Turret Lathe finish the back plate of a 24-inch
Scroll Chuck, shown above, in 1 9 minutes, but it machined it to such a degree of accuracy
that when finished practically no hand work was necessary.
Quantity production on the Gisholt is obtained by the simultaneous use of tool post and
turret, and there are numerous other exclusive features which stamp the Gisholt as a big
profit-maker for machine-shops. We are at your service any time with information on
the service which the Gisholt Turret Lathe can render on your particular work. Our
business is to convince you, and we can. Special Booklet dealing with this machine
forwarded on request; also regarding Le Blond Lathes, Warner and Swasey Lathes, South
Bend Lathes, Le Blond Millers, Prentice Radial Drills, Landis Screwers, etc.

Speed up the Workshop
with Electric Machine Tools
ENGINEERING workshops and foundries are fast realising the enormous
advantages of using electric tools, such as Hand and Breast Drills, Screw
Peed Drills, Heavy Duty Drills, Grinders, Clipping Hammers and
Percussion Drills.
All the excessive time and labor of manipulating heavy pieces of work are eliminated
by taking the portable machine to the work and operating in any position. They
can be operated from any convenient lamp socket if a power switch is not
available.
They enable work to be done on machine tools with extreme rapidity, eliminating
dismantling, and in every way are a valuable adjunct to all classes of machine-tool
operations.
Here we show but a few of a wide range of electric machine tools which we stock.
They are operated by self-contained Motors for either Direct or Alternating Current,
Or we have Universal Motor Machines for use on both Direct and Alternating
Current of the same voltage. Prices are extremely moderate compared with the
great benefits they bring to machine shops. Write for particulars of these tools to

The Globe, London’s oldest evening paper
—it has been running for nearly 120 years—
has been regenerated under Robert Donald,
who was evicted from the Daily Chronicle
when a Lloyd Georgian syndicate suddenly
got hold of it. It has seen many vicissitudes.
At one time that wildest of Irish priests,
Father Frank Mahony, widely known and
read under his pen-name of “Father Prout,”
was part-proprietor. It achieved a big sen-
sation in Disraeli’s time by publishing a con-
fidential War Office document, and during
the Great War its publication was suspended
for a week for defying the Censor. For
some time Australian J. F. Ilogan wrote its
daily Parliamentary sketch, a useful appren-
ticeship for his subsequent years as an M.P.
“2175”: Sorry to contradict “Scaler” (B.
27/11/’l9), but Broncho, the “bad man”
about whom the A.I.F. told a thousand
stories, is still alive. The crook who went
west was S , and he was shot as
“Scaler” mentions. Broncho, who was
B , was a 6th reinforcement, and
left in the Karoola with me in June,
T 5. I last saw him outside the
A.P.M.’s at Charleroi in a light car with
the ratchets on and carefully attended to
by six 4th Divvy Jacks. He was on his
way to Amiens to stand court-martial for the
murder of a Frenchman. Luck was with
him, and he caught only six months. This
w y as in May, 1919. I knew all the gang,
and spent some time in Charleroi helping
to clean it up. I was in the A.P.C., and
we did enough gunwork to fit up a dozen
Wild West pictures.
“Billo”: “G.L.8.” says (B. 11/12/19)
that “Centurion” exaggerated the positions
of trust held by prisoners working on the
Bagdad railway. Well, there was a more re-
markable case where I had the bad luck to
fall. In Gustrow, Mecklenburg, a young
Frenchman called Georges Melik had sole
charge of a busy branch of the Deutsche
Bank, with a daily business of thousands of
marks. In addition he conducted the camp
orchestra, consisting of 25 instruments and
representing seven different nationalities.
With each of these players he could discuss
the technicalities of music in the other man’s
language. He was also a fine athlete. So
handy was Georges that he was offered a job
on the permanent staff of the bank; but,
rolling his large dqrk eyes, he warded off
all such advances with three words of
American —“Paris for mine !”
“Flying Trapeze”: Any man willing to
make money out of a performer who risks
his life or his lindis in a stage stunt should
have to foot the bill for the insurance policy.
As things are now, the stage daredevil who
commits a mistake goes intp the hospital or
the morgue, and the only difference it makes
to the manager who staged the thrill is that
the daredevil’s name is not on the pay-
sheet next week. Nor is his wife’s. Circus
artists of the old days trained for various
theatrical occupations so that, in case of
accident in any one of them, they could
switch to another. Modern vaudeville
requires polish, however, and the artist of
to-day hasn’t time to acquire perfection in
more than one job. As far as I know
there are no Australian insurance cos. tak-
ing risks in hazardous theatrical occupa-
tions, though in America every one of the
400 performers in Barnum and Bailey’s
and in Ringling’s Circus is covered.
“Goru” on canefields waste:—
I believe there is less difficulty in converting the
waste products of the sugar-mills than “Badila”
assumes (B. 27/11/’l9). I am in touch with the
man who, after patient investigation, made known
to Australia and the world the marvellous qualities
of Badila cane, and who in several other respects
has been a benefactor to the Australian sugar industry.
Years ago (perhaps 16) he showed me molasses
changed, at practically no expense, into a manure
carrying about 12 p.c. of potash, in a more valuable
chemical combination for manurial purposes than
the sulphate, and much more so than the muriate
formerly imported from Germany. Also, I have
been shown molasses made into a soft clean coke
at very small expense which works in producer gas-
engine plants like the best charcoal, leaving a free
and friable ash containing 40 to 50 p.c. of potash.
I have watched molasses put into a gas-producer and
converted into gaseous fuel suitable for direct firing
under boilers, and the residual ash has manurial or
other commercial value, owing to its high potash
content. The molasses-fodder business was partly
killed by the failure of the manufacturers to recog-
nise the factors necessary to successful mixing and
packing of their product, the faults also engendering
risk of spontaneous combustion; but in any case it
is doubtful whether that or even a better mixture-
would have made for itself a permanent market in
careless and wasteful Australia. The first-advocated
molasses fodder, 25 years ago, was the syrup absorbed
by cocoanut-cake, giving a well-balanced horse and
cattle ration, in every respect superior to the cane-
pith molasses-mixture subsequently offered to the
market without success.
SOMETHING CHEAP.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
As you re flying down the hill, skimming precipioe
and elitf,
Dodging iuts that wait to kill, vou hear someone
sob or sniff.
When the car flies on two wheels and recovers from
a leap,
He who owns it loudly squeals, “Run me into
something cheap!”
Gorgeous chances for a smash flashing past you raise
your hair;
If you want a costly crash you can get it here—or
there!
W atch the road and clutch the wheel while the
frightened women weep;
As upon your road you reel, look ahead for “some-
thing cheap.”
\ou are headed down the slope and the brakes refuse
to grip ;
\ou are almost out of hope, and the wind stings
like a whip ;
\ ou’ve a notion you’re to blame, and it makes your
young flesh creep,
But you must play out the game. So you search for
“something cheap.”
There are various hills in life. There are swifter
things than cars.
Now and then a high-speed wife sets you racing with
the stars.
Even when you’re told to stop at the draper’s bargain
heap,
You still pray outside the shop, “Run me into some-
thing cheap!”
N.s.w.

The cost of living continues to increase
by leaps and bounds, and thousands are
finding difficulty in making ends meet.
It behoves all classes of the community
to practise economy in everything and to
look to their general health to see there
is no waste of time and expense by preventable sickness.
By keeping the system clean by using a simple remedy to
ensure the proper working of the digestive organs when they
show signs of needing help, will prevent many serious
illnesses. Carelessness regarding these simple requirements
of Nature are costly both to the general health and the time
wasted. Keep Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills always at
hand, and take a pill or two occasionally to prevent
the little troubles, and the big ones will take care of
themselves. No better remedy can be had at any price.
All classes of the community use them, rich and poor,
male arid female—professional men who do not get
enough physical exercise, hard-working laborers who
get too much—ladies of society and shop-girls all find in
just the remedy to keep their systems in order. They cleanse the stomach,
purify the blood and tone the system, and aid in the digestion and assimi-
lation of the food. They are sold at a price within the reach of all classes.

The A.W.U. musters 30,000 members in
Queensland, and the official Industrial
Gazette for November, issued by the heart-
broken Labor Ministry which Ryan left
behind him, said that 6000 of them were out
of work.
A significant sign of the times in Mel-
bourne was an address presented to Gordon
Carter, late Sec. of the Vic. Public Ser-
vants’ Assoc., in consideration of his suc-
cessful endeavors to get salaries raised.
Some 45 members of the Assembly signed
the testimonial in gratitude to him for hav-
ing provided them with an excuse for asking
an increase in their own screw.
J. S. Dethridge, just re-appointed Vic.’s
representative on the Murray River Com-
mission for five years, is second member of
liis own State’s Water Commission. Pre-
viously he was chief engineer of water
supply. He does his job well, and dodges
the limelight. When the big railway smash
occurred at Richmond station about 12
years ago Dethridge was one of the first
on the scene, and did no end of fine work
in rescuing and liberating passengers.
“Allanbie” : When the Picton to Mittagong
iN.S.W.) deviation was proposed a few
years ago, the chief argument in its favor
was that it would mean a big saving in engiin*
haulage, as the grade would be less. The line
was opened lately, and after the first; month's
use the Department announced that there had
been a saving in haulage of 20,000 engine
miles. (Departmental cheers.) But no men-
tion was made of the fact that, when the
deviation was opened, all stations south of
Mittagong were made three miles further
from Sydney, and freights and fares were in-
creased accordingly.
“Hypo”; Mention of the “amiable Hutch-
inson,” Vic. Minister of Education, sitting
up half a night listening to McLachlan (I>.
4/12/T9), recalls a long night he and I
sat out together. It was nearly 30 years ago.
“Billy” Hutchinson was then a watchmaker
at Warracknabeal ( Vic.J. He was also hon.
sec. or hon. something of three-fourths of
the local societies, associations and clubs.
It was at the half-yearly balance of one
of these. We could get our figures to agree
within one penny. And the humble coin
simply would not come right. But “Billy”
kept his temper and searched on. I do
not agree with Hutchinson politically. But
his amiability is only exceeded by his
methodical ways.
New York still holds several Melbourne
artists with ropes of greenbacks. Billy
Barnes earns his Avine as designer of
theatrical costumes in the biggest local pro-
ductions. His studio is in the theatre dis-
trict, and, lest he forget, a fine water-color
of Ferntree Gully looks down on him as
he labors. “Honest Tom” Phelan, once of
Melbourne Arts, is turning out creditable
oils and can’t frame them fast enough for
his patrons. Several of his pictures Avere
recently sold in Mexico city. Tom lives in
the Bohemian quarter of Washington-
square. Harry Burne, of Sydney, Avho
fought right through ale war in the British
Army and finished up a major, is illustrating
stories and adorning magazine covers. Aleck
Laing (Cruickshank), who engineered
Pansy Montague Milo to the highest pinnacle
of vaudeville fame, has Avorked up a thriving
business. Ilis specialty is screen work. Apart
from Laing’s artistic ability—and he has
improved out of sight since leaving Aus-
tralia —his commercial acumen is well
developed.
"T.W.D.’s” send-off from Maoriland :
So little Billy Rainbow, the Sydney Museum
entomologist, has gone west. He began life as an
apprentice to the printing trade under the late John '
Ballance, with whom I was working at the time.
No sooner had he settled in Wanganui than he was
up chasing butterflies and looking for insects and
creeping things. His first job in the old Herald
Office was to wet down the paper for the evening
issue. I remember it always took Billy longer to
“wet down” in the summer than in the winter. His
work was done in an old shed at the back of the
office, and there were more butterflies and things
to distract him in the warm weather. After com-
pleting his apprenticeship to Ballance, Rainbow
journeyed to Wellington, and joined the Government
Printing Office. Our joint bedroom was Billy’s
embryo entomological museum—so littered with
precious bugs that it could never be dusted. A
short time after this the “frail-looking little
enthusiast” bade us good-bye, and then he wrote from
Sydney and told us of his change in life, and how
good Australia had been to him. To spend all his
hours Avith beetles and such things—he simply poured
out his heart in gratitude to the land that had given
him the chance to realise his dreams!
“Tom Noddy”: We had a champion
vanisher in our battalion. When avc arrived
in France in early 1916 he went on tour.'
Six months later he was arrested in Paris in
a staff-major’s uniform, and with another
absentee Digger acting as his batman. An
escort Avas ordered to return him to his unit.
While the train was going at top speed he
Avas taken to the lavatory. After a
few minutes the sergeant looked inside and
found his prisoner had mizzled. Nothing
was heard of him for a year, Avhen he Avas
again arrested in Paris. It was then found
that, after his train escape he had reported
to a hospital under an assumed name, saying
he had been bumped by a motor-car. He
had been evacuated to England, had con-
valesced and Avangled back to France. His
escort managed to deliver him to the bat-
talion, and a special guard was mounted on
him. He scorned these precautions, remark-
ing that he would not think of escaping
from liis own battalion. He didn’t. But
next night another battalion mounted guard
and he Avas again a free man. On his next
appearance (after the Armistice) he Avas
charged with desertion ; but as the Avitnesses
who could have proved the charge had either
been killed or returned to Australia, he got
a light sentence for absence without leave.
His official record is three years’ service.
Yet he never dreAv an army pay. In fact,
he has never asked the battalion canteen for
the 600 francs that he deposited for safety
during one of his Aisits. I knoAv —I was
the canteen sergeant. Wonder Avhat he Avill
do Avith his war gratuity.


Stop Torturing
Toothache Quickly.
Stopain Toothache Gum
Instantly Ends The Ache
And Helps Save The Tooth.
Don’t put up with toothache a minute. You
don’t have to. Just put a little piece of Stopain
Toothache Gum in the cavity, or around the
tooth and all pain is gone as if by magic.
Let STOPAIN Stop That Boring Pain.
It fills up the cavity, excluding the air, and
stopping the mouth acids from acting on the
frantic, jumping nerve; hardens quickly, and
forms a serviceable filling that will last for a
long time—until you are ready to have a per-
manent filling put in.
Why punish yourself ? Why endure the
agony of toothache when a shilling box of
Stopain Toothache Gum will quickly restore
your peace of mind ?
Keep it on hand for emergencies.
Stopain Toothache Gum is sold by most
medicine vendors at a shilling a box, or sent

Corns Quickly.
At last a real ‘ does what it says ’ Corn Cure;
nothing like it or just -s good has ever been

Every man or woman who has corns, warts
or bunions ought to try Handy Corn Cure at
once and see how marvellously it works. Quit
shaving your corn with a razor. You may draw
blood and cause blood-poisoning.
Handy Corn Cure will get rid of every corn
you have got without pain or discomfort.
Handy Corn Cure is remarkable because it
never irritates or turns the true flesh sore or
raw. It can’t—-it’s that antiseptic, safe and
harmless. The corn shrivels up and comes out.

A coated tongue
A coated tongue means bad
breath—bad taste in the mouth —
languor and debility, which are all
signs that the liver is out of order.
The liver is an organ secondary
in importance only to the heart.
When we are constipated we
manufacture within our bodies
poisons which are as deadly as a
snakes venom.
The liver acts as a guard over our
well-being, shifting out these
poisons from the general circulation.
A blockade in the intestines piles
a heavy burden upon the liver.
When the intestines are clogged
up the blood becomes poisoned
and the system becomes loaded
with toxic waste.
It is then that we suffer from
headache coated tongue bad
taste nausea flatulence acid
dyspepsia languor yellow skin
or eyes.
At such times you need a pleasant,,
reliable laxative, such as

Diarrhoea.
Diarrhoea attacks all ages, and is equally
fatal to young and old. The great danger in
this disease is due to the frequent lack of
proper treatment in the first stages. Chamber-
lain’s Colic and Diarrhoea Remedy is a reliable
and effective medicine, and if given in time
will prevent serious results. It never fails, and
is pleasant to take. Every household should
have a bottle on hand. Get it today. Cham-
berlain’s Colic and Diarrhoea Remedy taken at
the first unusual looseness of the bowels will
save suffering and anxiety—and loss of both
ime and money.
Take It With You.
The importance of having a bottle of Cham-
berlain’s Colic and Diarrhoea Remedy with
there, is realised by experienced travellers, as
this medicine cannot be bought on the train or
steamship. Change of water and diet often
deranges ti e stomach and bowels and produces
diarrhoea. As Chamberlain’s Colic and
Diarrhoea Remedy is the most reliable medicine
in use for these ailments, care should be taken
to have a bottle always on hand. Attacks of
bowel trouble nearly always come on suddenly
and when this remedy is at hand ail danger
pa*y be avoided.
Be Firm.
When you ask for a bottle of Chamberlain's
Colic and Diarrhoea Remedy, do not be per-
suaded to take anything else. Be firm in your
conviction that there is nothing so good. This
medicine has been tested in the most severe
cases of cramp, colic, dyser.'ery and diarrhoea,
and has never been kno»vn to fail. “ Can be
depended upon” is an expression always used
in connection with Chamberlain’s Colic and
Diarrhoea Remedy. One bottle goes a long
way towards relieving suffering humanity. It
never fails to give immediate and permanent
relief.

The final count at Ballarat left old Labor
member McGrath in a minority of one. It
probably saved that warrior much trouble.
If he had got in by a majority of one there
was a fixed intention in certain quarters to
demand an inquiry, with evidence taken on
oath, into his reported statements, made with
a view of acquiring votes, (1) that he had
been offered a billet in London at £2300 a
year jf he would turn conscriptionist, and
(2) that he could have had a commission
but wouldn’t take it, preferring to remain
with the Anzacs. And if these statements
proved unreliable the idea was to demand
his expulsion and disqualification on the plea
that his majority was acquired by false pre-
tences. The public grows tired of having
its nether limb dragged.

“Lightnin’” is plugging steadily along at
Sydney Criterion in pursuit of the record
run which the management has in view.
There are some weeks to go yet, but the
cracks of the company are in great fettle
and the nightly gates are highly encouraging.
At Sydney Opera House that designing
minx Cinderella still looks in at the Prince’s
ball just on midnight, and contrives to give
him the glad slipper before she departs.
Anita Stewart slips away from her Con-
vent school in Naples to mother the lonely
babies of America. She thinks America is
only across the road. Coming to her jour-
ney’s end she is adopted by an American
artist, who adds the baby that Anita has
picked up by the wayside to the mdnage.
Life in the studio is a happy dream
till the flyaway wife of the artist looks in
and drops a bomb into the circle. Then
there are tears, only mopped up when in an
argument with a providential motor-car the
wife gets flattened out. “Human Desire,”
it is called, and you see it at Sydney Crystal
Palace. At the Strand and Haymarket Fair-
banks is the “buckaroo” who plays leapfrog
over the housetops of a Mexican town,
rescues the girl he loves and overthrows the
thieving sheriff who has stolen her war
bonds and cast her into the dungeon keep.
Elaine Hamerstein registers her claim to
“Her Man” by plugging a few holes into
the body of his enemy at the Lyceum. At
Hoyt’s Tom Mix heralds “The Coming of
the Law,” and from Saturday the Turk will
be seen perpetrating untold horrors upon the
Armenian at the Town Hall.

Dame. Maurice
isn’t sufficiently
grimacious to ex-
press the varia-
tions in the
Dame's devouring
passions of
avarice and thirst,
but all the same
his business has a
dramatic touch
which embellishes
scenes that
Lupino fails to
adorn. With all
the disadvantage
of his emaciated
treble, Dudley
makes more of
the canoodly song
with Jack Can-
not, in which the
aspect of a trem-
bling debutante in
the higher emo-
tions is stressed
with a droll, dis-
trustful eyeball.
Jack Cannot has
brightened so
much that he only
needs boiling to
produce a good
furniture polish
or a brilliantine.
His ditty wherein
he requests his
Signora to take
her “caniisola”
and join his gon-
dola always hits
, , , the house in a
tender place, though his raiment makes him
look more like a dissipated Mexican peon
than a demented Dago with a distorted
heartache.

“The Sleeping Beauty.” is true to the advt.
winch says it is I unny without being Vulgar.
I erhaps, for the sake of more fun, a wee bit
more indelicacy might be forgiven; but no
doubt double-plated precautions must be
taken to protect the immaculate young
daughters of a couple whose purple past
pleads for oblivion. You mav think the
panto, has left them stainless, whereas even
a careless conundrum propounded by a pure-
minded Dame in celebration of her third
nuptials has given the girleens some ideas
which they couldn’t possibly explain if they
ever tried to do it.
, and Co.” improves with practice
at Melbourne Royal, and so the weeks go on.
1 here was talk of a change of bill approach-
mg, but the cloud on the horizon has gone,
and nothing worries Leslie Holland except
the alleged want of someone to love him.
At the Tivoli in Melbourne the days of
gentle musical comedy are numbered, and
the company will return to revue on Satur-
fki.v. “Oddments” is its name, and one hopes
it will act as satisfactorily as it sounds.
“The Love That Dares” is giving a hot-
house atmosphere to Hoyt’s Melbourne
theatres this week. The heroine (Madlaine
Traverse) gets herself into the same
predicament as Floria Tosca with Baron
Scarpia, but she keeps her lioriah in-
tact through the co-operation of the
scenario writer, who provides an unexpected
and unconvincing escape. Gladys Brockwell
in “The Strange Woman” discloses free love
to an American village, bnt her supply of
eccentricity soon runs out and she returns to
normal matrimony again. Hoyt’s are also
starring an English feature, "The Pit Boy’s
Romance,” which provides some openings
for the penetrating lefts of the well-known
featherweight Jimmy Wilde. The scene of
the story is laid in
Wales, ' and the
genuine landscape
is a welcome change
from the bogus
jungle and Alpine
effects that are
always arriving
from California. At
the Majestic Cap-
tain Hurley’s pic-
ture s of the
Shackleton A n t-
arctic Expedition
screen nicely in the
company of full ex-
planations from the
eloquent phot p-
grapher. Current
fiction at the same
theatre is “The
Better Wife,” in
which Clara Kim-
ball Young demon-
strates that “better”
is hardly a strong
enough word.
Adelaide shows
are much as before,
except that Ivehoe’s
short Irish season
at the Tivoli has
closed. “The Sleep-
ing Beauty” is now
“Peg o’ My Heart,” at
Sydney Palace .
Marie Ney as the chilly
Miss Chicester.
at that house, and Adelaide, which
isii't used to a pantomime at Christmas, wel-
comes the novelty. The story somehow con-
trives to bring in the old Coventry legend,
with Bert Watson a.s Peeping Tom, and
Victor Prince is Sir Guy. “Whom God hath
Joined,” at the Royal, is a sermon against
divorce, with Adrienne Ray as the wife who
suffered for being hasty, and Francis Hugo
as the lawyer who warned others off the
track. Neat turns at the Tivoli, not pre-
viously noticed, are Pinto’s acrobatic work
and Baron’s ventriloquising. “ ’Possum Pad-
dock” at the Exhibition Gardens has hit the
popular fancy ; but playing in the open makes
for broad effects, and on stormy nights a
player has to lean across the footlights like an
Italian tenor if he is to-be heard at all. In

“The Bird of Paradise,” reaching Lon-
don at last, has caused a mild boom in the
music of Hawaii. There is a suggestion
that it will “sweep London, and supersede
the noisy jazz.” A feature is made of the
hula dance. One publisher calls it “haunt-
ing, restful and melodious.” The “restful”
shows how much of the real hula there is
about it.
“J.F.11.” (London) : Going into figures,
Oscar Asche says that the first year of “Ghu
Chin Chow” yielded a revenue of £124,000
the second £131,000, the third £176,000, while
the fourth shows even higher average weekly
receipts. The original cost of the produc-
tion was £5350, but new features and cos-
tumes and Oriental curios are constantly
dropped into the piece.
“Paul Cupid” : It was at a welcome home
to soldiers that I heard it sung. This was
the chorus:—
Ho-wum, ho-\vum, swe-eet, srve-eet ho-wum;
Ther snow pla sli ko-wum,
Ther snow-o pla sli kome.
I tapped a fellow in front of me, who had
been roaring with the rest, and asked him
what song it might be and what language it
was in. He astonished me by saying: “Lang-
widge? Strike me, don't y’know ‘ 'Ome,
Sweet 'Ome,’ w’en y’ ’ear it?”
“Ike Pagliacci” • It was, is, and always
has been spot cash with the Perrys (JB.
20/11/’l9). They paid their artists in
sovereigns, and if they bought a tent they
Paid for that in sovereigns, too. The cash
habit was a strong point with all the older
circuses travelling by road. One of them once
wired well-known circus agent Jack Cameron
in Maoriland, saying, “Meet us in New
South Wales. Important.” Cameron took
the first boat and tracked the show down ip
the Far North-West. The boss greeted him
casually, thrust 300 one-pound notes in his
hand and told him to go to Melbourne and
buy printing. Latter-day circuses, with long
stops in the city, are not so casual. In one
concern three members of the firm sit at a
table each pay-day and the creditors come
in one by one. The first member picks up
the account, scans it carefully and puts his
initials on it. The second looks at it through
his spectacles, frowns and groans, and passes
it on. No. 3 gives one startled look at the
amount, places his hand to his brow, and
exclaims “Hell!”
“Vaudeville Vet.”: Apropos the value of
multi-colored pictorials to early Australian
managers, Harry Abdy (father of Marie L'>
Varre and the subject of recent Poverty
Point pars.) was the proud possessor of a
few lithographs on his first visit to this
country. The sacrilegious hand of the bill-
poster never touched them. Instead, when
Abdy got to a town he spread them out —
sometimes on a vacant allotment with a
stone on each corner—and when the inhabi-
tants had gazed their fill the precious paper
was folded up lovingly and packed away
ready for the next stop.
Randolph Bedford writes:—
“Macquarie-street” (B. (25/12/ - l9>, writing
of German doctors and the attempt made to have
them disbarred or unfrocked or whatever the term
for professional extinction may he, mentions a sur-
geon named Herz. I don’t know Herz from a plate
of soup, but the late Harry Maxted, of N.S.W. State
Children’s Department, Showed me a list of his
successes with deformed wards of the State, and
some of them were little short of marvellous. There
was the case of two children, brothers, one eight
and the other 10. They had never been taught to
walk. They lived in burrows and shambled, like
seals on the inner sides of the thighs and calves
Herz straightened them and made them walk erect
He "’as of more importance to the human seals
than a less competent and more “loyal” practi-
tioner could have been. In fact, there' are incom-
petent professional men in every walk who in
denouncing Huns merely denounce professional rivals.
Ability counts, and Australia can’t afford to refuse
it because of a post-war vendetta which is often
wind when it isn’t jealousy.
> r K :,’ : . Fv , e “ e , ve . r caught thieves myself,
but that shouldn’t disqualify me as an
authority ; so I’m writing a text-book —“How
to Pursue and Capture Burglars.” The
evening paper’s account of the latest bunglerv
drove me to it. A Sydney greengrocer, com-
ing downstairs to go to early market, saw
the shop-door open and two strangers help-
iog themselves to tobacco and cigarettes.
He watched them for a few seconds and then
called “What are you doing there V” In-
stead of returning a straightforward answer,
the two strangers ran out and up the street.
The pursuit then began. The pursuer was
wearing the sort of slippers that fall off
easily and carried a heavy bag of money.
It may have been his intention to stun the
sti angers with the money, but he never got
near enough to do it. Besides being handi-
capped by the bullion and the slippers,
he also stopped to address a group of
early loungers, ‘‘who couldn’t have grasped
the situation, because they took no notice of
me.” It was probably the first time they
had ever seen a man chasing burglars with
a bag of money. The various delays en
route probably saved the greengrocer, for
lie was 40 yards from his thieves when one
ol them pulled out a revolver and fired a
shot. It missed, but sent the greengrocer
home to count his loss. It came to a pound,
lhe police wound up the performance by
scouting the locality without success.” I

. Rill o Costs : Some of my learned mates
higher up the tree have Set a bad and tire-
some practice of smooging to the Bench. It
grew, as all such things do, from big, pardon-
able events. When an old Judge is about
to retire, or a new one has been hatched,
the Bar —meaning a random collection
lounded up on short notice —gathers in
t° solemnly offer congratulations
ibis may be called the Grand Smooge
~very pleasant and not out of place.
It. is customary on such occasions for the
retiring Judge to say that “but for the
coidial co-operation of the Bar” he would
not have been able” etc., and for the new
one to talk of his sacred obligations and add
that he “relies on the generous assistance of

Old and new Judge alike know that the Bai-
ls out to hoodwink them —to let them go
wrong if they are laying the foundation of
a good appeal, and to carry the art of bluff
to the point of offensiveness if it seems likelv
to be successful. However, these speeches
are an agreeable convention and go with
the fiction of judicial innocence, the red cur-
tains and the tipstaff’s brass-fittings. But
gradually the felicitation business has lent
itself to more casual and baser uses. When-
ever a Judge has become saddled with knight-
hood or some new job, or has moved into a
new court, it has become usual for some K.C.
to rise and offer his Honor the usual con-
gratulations. Now I notice that if only it
is discovered that his Honor has had a birth-
day, or is to take a holiday, or has come
back from one, or that he has less or more
work to do than usual, or that Christmas is
coining or rain falling, it is made the oppor-
tunity of Mr. Bluff, the senior present, “on
behalf of the Bar, y ’Onor” (himself and
two others), to pour butter and honey all
over the legal umpire. It’s a stickv business
and quite unnecessary.
THE NEW HUMOR.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“The most expensive comedy ‘gag’ . ever intro-
duced into a pantomime in Australia is featured by
the Brothers Egbert in ‘The Sleeping Beautv.’ In
the course of their fun-making a violin is smashed
beyond repair. The violin is not a ‘property’ in-
strument, but a genuine, first-class one used by a
member of the orchestra. The J. C. Williamson
management, however, views the expense with equa-
nimity, as the ‘gag’ is the funniest that has ever
been done in pantomime.’’ —Theatrical piffle.
Excuse my merriment, but I’ve just been
To quite the most hilarious of shows.
It you had witnessed half the things I’ve seen
You would, I’m sure, have suffered mirthful throe-.
The comic men, believe me, were immense ;
They cracked their jokes regardless of expense.
The saddest cit. could not forbear to smile
At humor so exceeding rich and rare;
One joker, with a hammer, smashed a pile
Of fine old willow-pattern chinaware,
And then proceeded in a manner droll
To tear to shreds a costly ermine stole.
Of course, the house enjoyed this pleasing fun.
But to the quaint comedians’ resource
There was no limit. They had but begun!
We roared to see their counterfeit remorse
When, with rare whimsicality, they had
Both jumped upon a genuine old Strad.
The waggish way in which they put their feet
Through pictures signed by artists of repute
Was, all confessed, an unaccustomed treat ;
And then one jester commandeered a flute.
'Twas worth a sovereign just to go and see
The jester smash the thing across his knee.
They did no single thing throughout their turn
To bring to Modesty the blush of shame;
Wit sans vulgarity must always earn
l ? or its practitioners enduring fame;
And though the bill is large, the management
Knows well that all the coin is wisely' spent.

“Bunder”: An Oriental Hotel episode in
Melbourne, as a result of which some star
actresses left by request, reminds me of my
touring days in the English provinces. In
small towns long-suffering landladies would
their doors the moment they
caught sight of the dress basket —the
hallmark of the touring pro.—on the
cab; roof. One Sunday, after touring a
small burg for the best part of the after-
noon in a vain search for accommodation,
my! pal and I hit on a plan. Leaving our
baskets at the theatre, we took what we
wanted in a paper parcel and resumed the
search. The first door we knocked at was
opened by a stern-visaged dame who snapped
at jus, “Actors?” “No fear! bookies,’’ re-
plied my resourceful pal. The grim visage
relaxed into a smile. “Come in,” she said.
I bbught a bag after that.
J, P. Levoi sends a good word :
I 'have just received a letter from Jack Waller,
written in Calcutta and dated November 7, in which
he says he is quite well and doing big business. As
many of his Australian friends believe he was killed
in a, motor accident during October, I shall be
pleaded, etc., etc.
Even later, when Ross Smith was at
Karachi, Waller met him and dissembled
his recent demise with conspicuous skill.
“Stargazer”: Pantomimes become more
and I more entertainments for the totally deaf.
So long as you do not hear a pantomime it
is ajmusing; but the more you hear the less
pleased you are. The panto, was originally
a play that had nothing to say for itself,
and if it is not to be something nobody can

Girl,” at Sydney

have anything to
say for it should
return to its in-
articulate con-
dition, The mere
saying of things;
that have no bear-
ing on the tale to
be told and which
have no value of
their own, is a
ridiculous super-
fluity. The idea
that a thing is
funny because the
funny man says it
no longer prevails.
The pictures have
accustomed people
to dumb show, and
have given them to
see how they are
wronged when
action is delayed
by monkey chatter
and the noises men
make when they
have nothing to
say. Talk, in fact,
spoils the telling
effect of pantomime. What a bore Chaplin
would be if he mewed the vulgar rubbish
that goes with his kind of stuff on the
speaking stage!
“Glen H.’': Stella Power seems to have
been handicapped in London by too much
preliminary boosting from Melba and the
fact that her management insisted upon
engaging the Albert Hall for her first con-
cert. The Times critic says he would like
tfo hear the lady in a smaller hall: “it
sounded as if she were .singing in Australia
and we were listening to her on a relay
telephone.” The Albert Hall has wrecked
more voices than it ever made, but most of
the big entrepreneurs suffer from a species of
professional snobbery which impels them to
let off their musical rockets in its huge
interior. Most of the critics are kind to
the young songstress, but are cautious about
endorsing Melba’s opinion that she possesses
“a perfectly glorious soprano voice.”
“Yarra Ben”: Curious to note how Christ-
mas observance has altered these last few
years. In Melbourne as in Sydney no news-
papers were published on this last December
25, but all the theatres opened their doors.
It is only during the last year or two that
this showman’s move has been made. No
great objection seems to be taken to it, least
of all by the people who give the shows. The
“no-play no-pay” clause in their contracts
operated during former Christmas-night
closures ; they now pocket an ordinary night’s
salary, and the great majority are very glad
to get it.
“E.T.”: The one-year-old London Actors’
Union has sustained a severe loss through the
death of its first chairman, Sydney Valentine.
A brilliant actor, Valentine, when the need
arose, proved himself a no-less brilliant
organiser, and it is mainly owing to his un-
tiring efforts that English mummers have
nowadays a strong and wholesomely-
respected association to safeguard their in-
terests on trade-union lines.
“LTGHTNIN',”

CRITERION.
John Beck as
the Sheriff.
Alfred Dam-
pier had talked
to the pressmen
with reference
to a forthcom-
ing appearance
as Hamlet, and
the interview
had been pub-
lished. “With
regard to this
rev i v a 1,” he
said, “my wish is to correct a wide-
spread popular error.” George Rignold
read this much out to Alfred ; then he paused
a moment, and said in abstracted tones:
“But, after all, do the.people think you can
act, Dampier?” It was George Rignold also
who said of another pro.: “People seeing
Dick on the street always think he is an
actor. He spends his evenings on the stage
correcting the misconception.”
Ivy Shilling has added another to her list
of London successes by her dancing in “Mag-
gie,” a musical play reminiscent of “Diana
of Dobson’s,” which is booming at the Oxford.
“G.H.” : Young Hubert Marshall Hall, son
of Melbourne’s late well-loved Prof., recently
laid aside the fiddle he was playing in a Lon-
don orchestra and dressed himself in grease-
paint. The young man, who in his cocksure
cubhood at Melbourne ’Varsity revealed much
of his dad’s aggressiveness and a hint of his
mental alertness, soon showed that he had
an aptitude for mumming, and was given a
part in the American play, “Tiger Rose,” at
London Savoy. He is now in danger of be-
coming an habitual actor, and his musical
friends are regretting the loss of one whom
they hoped would be a fiddler of repute.
“C. Ockney”: Arthur Wontner, remem-
bered in Australia as a useful mummer in
secondary rOles with the Julius Knight-
Maud Jeffries crowd, is in the spot-lime in
London these days. At latest he was the
lead in an interesting production of the
centuries-old Hindoo drama “Sakuntala” at
the Winter Garden hard by Drury-lane.
Wontner played Dushyanta, King of India;
and Caleb Porter, also well-known in these
parts, was Durvasa, an ancient curser.
Recent visitors to Oscar Asche’s “Chu
Chin Chow” included the King and Queen of
Spain, who are keen theatre-goers and sent
for Asche and Lily Brayton after the show,
and the Shah of Persia. Both the principals
have been away for a rest at odd times
during the over-three years of the play’s
run, but it is claimed that Sydney Fair-
brother has never missed a performance. The
lady with the man’s name was first remark-
able as one of the original “Two Little
A'agabonds,” but has developed latterly on
the comic side.
“Old Pro.” : There’s a lot of talk, by news-
paper and other people, about the com-
position of the stuff which passes for white-
wash or paste on the stage. It is always
much in evidence at panto time. You never
see Jack and Jill and the Beanstalk, or Dick
Whittington and his Forty Thieves, but the
Dame or somebody else gets a smack in the
face with a full-charged whitewash brush,
and you always wonder why the mixture
gives" no apparent inconvenience. In the
J.G.W. Melbourne panto this year there is
more than usual of it, and it is merely soap.
Whbn the head of a brother Egbert is posi-
tively swathed in something white and frothy
it is* merely innocuous lather that he drips.
The soap has been whipped into a fury by
electricity, and with all the soda eliminated
it can be flung about without worrying any-
one’s eyes.
“Snell”: Which is the most famous dog in
the world? I enter Keystone Teddy, an
artist almost as notorious as Charley Chap-
lin himself. This remarkable tyke has
appeared in scores of comedies, always with
an important part, sometimes, as in the case
of the last 1 saw, playing leading man. No
other film comedian, with the exception of
Chaplin, is as popular as Teddy, and he de-
serves his success. If genius is really only
a capacity for taking pains, Teddy is a
genius, since the task of perfecting him in
his remarkable stunts involves extraordinary
patience and unremitting care. In his latest
comedy Teddy is the centre of interest, play-
ing 20 minutes, fast time, and he must get
through a hundred escapades, each involving
intelligence and ability absolutely human.
Teddy is said to be worth £20,000 to the
Keystone, and is insured for about that sum,
but there is no chance of the firm drowning
him for the insurance money.
“Belle Canto”: New York Sammies suc-
cessfully blocked the proposed German opera
season in New York. The operas to be
given were not characteristically German,
but included most of the stock gems of an
Italian repertoire. The costumes, props and
scenery for the season were bought from
the Oscar Hammerstein estate, and had been
stored since the time the big man shipped
them from the Big Fog after his
disastrous season there with grand opera
at theatre prices. The remarkable Ham-
merstein, by the way, once wrote an
opera himself. It was composed as the result
of a wager with Gustave Kerker, the inven-
tor of the “Belle of New York” melodies,
and the score had to be completed in 24
hours. Hammerstein shut himself in a room
with a piano and started to write, while
Kerker and his pals scoured the town for
barrel-organ men, whom they engaged to play
outside the composer’s window. They also
engaged relays of waiters to carry up un-
ordered sandwiches, all of which Hammer-
stein politely took from them with thanks.
The street musicians were not chased away
either, and at the end of the allotted time
the Jew emerged triumphant with his score.
Kerker sat down and played it through. He
said it was rotten, but he couldn’t get away
from the fact that it was an opera, and he
paid up. Hammerstein, who claimed that
he never knew the sensation of being satis-
fied, actually produced the composition—once.
“Old Pot”: G. V. Brooke, like most of the
tragedians, eschewed Shakspeare’s “Taming
of the Shrew,” and staged the old farce-
version called “Katherine and Petruchio,” in
which Petruchio hops around cracking a whip
like the ringmaster in a circus. I saw Charles
Dillon play this in the Cold Country, and
he made it almost a burlesque. It is remark-
able that the tragedians should have pre-
ferred the old farce, but I suppose they
thought it a better acting version, just as
thev turned down Shakspeare’s “Richard the
Third” for Colley Cibber’s vamped-up
tragedy. Margaret Anglin with Henry Kol-
ker, and Lily Brayton with Oscar Asehe,
gave us the real Avon comedy, Asche in-
troducing the seldom-staged Induction, which
showed him at his best as a character-actor.
No one who saw his Christopher Sly, the
tinker, is ever likely to forget it. Shakspeare
based his comedy upon “a pleasant conceited
History called The Taming of a Shrew,”
printed in 1594, and “sundry times acted by
the Right Honorable the Earl of Pem-
broke his servants.”
“Stargazer”: Young Harold Iledgewiek.
actor, had been saying bitter things about
the press, and the pressmen had listened,
too overcome to make any sort of a defence.
“The fact,” Iledgewiek insisted, “is that
Press and Stage are at daggers drawn, and
you fellows, when you think you are
criticising, are really only expressing, cr
at the best thinly disguising, an intuitive
antipathy. You hate us, and you have your
knives into us. I don’t know why, unless
it is because we have the public eye and
the people’s affection. We never get a really
sympathetic review. We are attacked, or
we are tolerated. What is wanted on the
.part of the papers is some real, genuine
interest in our work, some little kindly de-
sire to help us along, encourage and
strengthen us.j’ Then we had another
drink, and presently Hedgewick, who had
taken up a weekly, and was reading a
criticism of a rival show, cried : “Just listen
to this, will you?” He read a few para-
graphs. “AA T hat kind of piffle do you call
that?” he said. “Good Lord, how I could
cut that rotten push to pieces!”
“Blackout”: The incapacity of many of
the mummers forced upon Australia in lead-
ing parts is hinted at in Compton Mac-
kenzie’s latest novel, “Poor Relations” ; and
“The Bing Bogs on
Broodway ,” at Sydney
Majesty's.

Mackenzie, wli o

In his book a suc-

receives from a

letter which re-
marks: “AY e 11,

Lucky man! If
you send out an

pan y, don’t you
think I might play
lead? I quite un-
derstand that you
couldn’t manage it
for me either in
London or Amer-
ica, but, after all,
you are the author
and you surely
have some say in
the cast.’’ Then
there is the play-
wright’s comment:
“‘I wish Eleanor
was anywhere but
on the stage,’ John
sighed. ‘But she's
a plucky woman.’ "
In addition, vari-
o u s Australian
managements are
plucky enough :o
import the fourth-
rate, and audiences are not always plucky
enough to stay away.
“John A. G.” : Re the Sundry Showman’s
remark (B. 13/11/’10) that the J.C.M.
Grand Opera Co. treated the Tales of Hoff-
mann” less seriously than usual. I witnessed
a performance of this opera at the Opera
Comique on 12/5/19, and Hoffmann (Leon
Beyle) was apparently the only person who
took the tragic episodes seriously. At
L’Opdra Comique the lighter operas are
presented, only the tragic heavyweights be-
ing produced at the magnificent theatre in
the Place de The bill for that
week included “Faust” and “Thais.
“Sexagen”: There has been published
lately a “Diggers’ Guide” to new phrases in
use since the war. But one is also needed
for the words of their sisters behind the
scenes. I heard an appeal to the call-boy
at a variety show last week : “Adrian, run
and tell the gas-man that Miss Beano’s lights
is going lousy.”
“Bill Bowyang”: Now that we are making
our own films may I suggest that Binghi be
engaged occasionally as a movie artist. 11 borne
years back a Yankee co. with its cameiu
operators visited Yarrabah Mission Station
(N.Q.) after touring the South Sea Islands.
It was decided to make use of several of the
aboriginals in the construction of a film ol
wild Australian life. Although tact and
patience were required before the camera got
to work the acting of the blacks made Hiram
Film swallow his cigar whole. The Yanks
guessed there was a fortune in a him which
would show their work on land and water.
So far I have seen Binghi in only two
locally-manufactured pictures. Towards pro-
viding the sensation that the small boy loves
the abo. can put the Red Indian completely
in the shade.

When I was young I dreamed my dream —
An artist I would be;
The right thing done with art supreme
Was all I wished to see.
The beauty and the joy of life,
Its melodies and graces,
I would interpret free of strife
That rules in market-places.
They hired my service for the play
At market rates. I weep
To think that when it suited they
Retailed me very cheap.
They looked me o’er as on a stall,
And ticketed; I swear
They gave me not a thought at all
If there were cheaper there.
In glutted times they cut me down.
And on the shelf I lay,
And oft my art about the town
I hawked the live-long day.
But now they come with manners nice,
And smile and murmur “Please!”
In all politeness pay my price,
For I am selling cheese!

400,000 Motor Cars
in Five Years.
Dodge Brothers Again Achieve
Record for Rapid Development
of Great Industry.
WHEN Dodge Brothers Motor Car
number 400,000 rolled from the
assembly line and swung around
the factory test-track for a final inspection
before delivery, it marked a manufacturing
achievement of exceptional importance in
the history of the motor-car industry.
The achievement is unique because 400,000
Motor Cars were produced and marketed
during the first five years of operation, which
is a record in the automobile industry.
Less than five years ago, on December 4,
1914, to be exact, the first Motor Car bearing
the DODGE BROTHERS name-plate was
shipped to a bona fide purchaser. It was the
first material evidence of Dodge Brothers’
determination to devote their wide manu-
facturing experience to the production of
complete Motor Cars. Since that day the
shipments have been growing in volume until
a few days ago the 400,000-mark was
reached.
In 1914 Dodge Brothers’ works covered
approximately twenty acres of floor space,
and even then was - considered one of the
large manufacturing plants of America. But
unit after unit has been added with unfail-
ing regularity until the original twenty acres
have grown to ninety, and the number of
employees to more than IS,000.
The first hundred-thousand car was com-
pleted October 31, 1916, the second on
October 31, 1917, and the third on December
13, 1918.
Time was when the Motor Car was re-
garded as a luxury, but the huge figures
quoted above would indicate that it must
now be classed as a utility or a necessity.
Particularly does this apply in a country like
Australia, where the need of quick transport
becomes daily more apparent. With a com-
paratively small population and a country of
great distances it is a difficult problem for
any Government to adequately cater for the
more remote districts in the matter of rail-
ways. Consequently the man on the land, if
he would keep abreast of the times, must
equip himself with a Motor Car.
Dodge Brothers Cars have proved their
utility not only to the man on the land, but
in all branches of trade. Built to a rigid
standard fixed by the tw*o active partners of
the concern they have established their value
for reliability and honest worth. The fact
that “Dodge Brothers” Car is a “Standard-
ised” production should appeal to users, as
repair parts ait readily obtainable at rea-
sonable prices, whilst the Car itself invari-
ably commands a price approximating new
cost when sold at second-hand.
THE STANDARDISED MOTORS
LIMITED, 276 Castlereagh Street, Sydney,
advise that they have been selling practically
all their shipments to arrive, but they anti-
cipate arrival' of ample stocks out of which
delivery can be given at the end of January.

Dodge Brothers
MOTOR CAR
The same things are thought and said about Dodge
Brothers Motor Car everywhere.
The eagerness to own the car is no greater in one
country, or State, or section, than it is in another.
In proportion to population, the demand is just as
steady wherever you go.
It has continued to be just as even, and just as
steady, for more than four years.
The good opinion of the car has not lagged, or
lapsed, or faltered, since the first cars were built.
The only change has been an increased and intensified
appreciation and increased confidence in the builder.
And Dodge Brothers purpose to continue to make
their car so good that they will always deserve this
confidence.
The petrol consumption is unusually low.
The tyre mileage is unusually high.

PROPELY
Gone where the good horses go—Rebus.
He died at AVindsor (N.S.AAb) from a nipt .red
bowel. Few better have raced at Randwick, and no
better handicap horse was ever trained in Aus-
tralia. AVinner of an Epsom, the Villiers, a Metrop.
and the Sydney Cup, he was as little worried by
distance as by weight. Albert AVood, who always
rode the Englishman, is ready to take oath that he
was a long way better than his record showed. His
best perfoimance? Well, perhaps the Epsom, but
the way he unwound himself from six furlongs in
the A’illiers after moving off last was a revelation.
A big, powerful chap, though rather shabby in
front, Rebus was extraordinarily strong on his feet
and a great fighter in a field. He cost Joe Lemon
less than £5OO, earned £11,500 in stakes in two
seasons, and delivered the other sort of earnings by
the ton.
* * * *
The Villiers to Anyhow, the A.J.C. Sum-
mer Cup to Pah King and then Tatt.’s Cup to—
Panacre! It all came like a run of sevens in a
hazard school. B.y every rule of the game the one
animal without a hope in the well-gilt mile-and-a-
half event on New Year’s Day was the hard-worked
son of Linacre —that is, if it had been forgotten that
in the Spring he won the A.J.C. Final Handicap, a
mile and a quarter, with lOst. on top and gave
nothing a chance on the trip. The conspicuous fact
was that he had had three severe races the week be-
fore, over six furlongs, a mile and a half and five
furlongs, and except in the Villiers mile never even
looked like a winner. Campbell Wood, the horse’s
owner, believed he would see the trip out. Trainer
Alf Inkpen had hopes. But beyond this pair
no one gave him a serious thought. The rush was
for Kenilford, Posiastre, Eastcourt, Prince Viridis
and Satin Bird. They were soon out of their misery.
Running quietly along behind Posiastre, who rushed
off in front, Panacre closed on him at the turn, and
when he blew out, a furlong further, had nothing in
front to catch and nothing behind with a run. All
McLachlan had to do was sit there, and the judge
said five lengths; Kenilford struggling on next just
ahead of Sandbee. Panacre had taken many good
wads from Ike in his time, but he made a lot of
it up to Israel on this race. There we.re 100’s to
three freely on offer about him at the start.
* * * *
Another young ’un worth remembering
later on came to light at Randwick the other day—
AAJrrawav, a smart looking colt bv imoorted
October from Clonsilla, and therefore half-brother to
Sobrina. He made the last bit of the 5£ furlongs
of Tatt.’s Nursery scamper a funeral for the rest,
and there were some smart ones in it too.
Sam Hordern looked on Tatt.’s Cup as
almost a certainty for Kenilford. AVherefore the
deficit chargeable to that unlucky animal mounts Still
higher. But the Hordern luck has been fairly good
in the small things lately. Imported Emblematic
annexed a race at a country meeting recently (and
was beaten at Randwick afterwards), and Pleasant
Days and Petwvn. both by Bronzino, appropriated a
couple at Warwick Farm on Saturday.
That remarkable horse Wee Gun —gener-
ally called “little,” though not so small by actual
measurement as he seems to the eye—repeated on
New Year’s Day his double of two years ago. In
the S.A. Jockey Club meeting at Morphettville, he
won the weight-for-age, from Stagegirl and seven
others, and two hours later carried 9st. 71b. in the
New Year’s Gift, and won from Bookeloo (7st. 101 b.)
and Shacko (Bst. 51b.). It was his third successive
win in the weight-for-age. He is eight years old, by
Kooringa—Escopette, was bred by John Lewis, and
has had some experience at the stud.
Tullilah. a five-year-old gelding by
Ritualist —Equalise, the outsider of the party of eight
runners, won the Trial Hurdles at Moonee Valley the
other day after being in the lead, or thereabouts,
all the way. It was the nag’s first success. The
surprise-packet’s price was 25 to one, but 33’s were
offered in several parts of the paddock. One enter-
prising sport was laid £lO to 2s. and was almost
ashamed to take the money.
Bobby Lewis makes it one of bis hobbies
to win the valuable Bagot Handicap at Flemington.
When he got King of the Sea first past the post on
New Year’s Day it was the fifth occasion on which he
had ridden the winner of the event. Robert’s pre-
vious successful mounts were Lochaber in 1899, The
Bride in 1900, Annotate in 1903 and Orvieto in 1912.
In three of the races at Flemington on
New Year’s Day the field numbered 13. That
wouldn’t have signified so much if the remaining
three events had panned out all right. But, as a
matter of fact, punters were all at sea. At the
finish McShortodds could hardly get his bag shut.
It may often have happened that a rank
outsider from a powerful stable has won the Stan-
dish sprint on New Year’s Day; but in every case
there has been good excuse for the scarcity of the
public dollar. When Blue Cross won the race at
20 to 1 there was no excuse. Two years ago the
gelded son of Linacre ran third for the Oakleigh
Plate and won the Hawksburn Handicap. Last
year he repeated the performances, and on each
occasion he was registered as Number 8 in the
Newmarket. With only Bst. 31b. up—or 31b. less than
he won the Hawksburn with —he was one of the
most likely on paper. History is always repeat-
ing itself with the sprinters of class, and Blue
Cross had proved himself classy. Apparently the
stable error arose out of the old, old fallacy of
assuming that the gee had not done enough work.
Trainers are slow to learn exactly how little work
serves as sufficient preparation for an elderly geld-
ing engaged in a six-furlongs scamper. Getting a
nice uninterrupted run down the Flemington straight,
Blue Cross was easily better at the weights than
bis stable pal Sir Ibex, Sindbad the Sailor and
Wedge. Stable-companion Lannion got caught in
the barrier, so the only thing proved about the
Newmarket prospects of this handsome visitor is
that he isn’t one of the easily managed sort.
That frequent and honest performer, King of the
Sea, took the Bagot Handicap from Carriole and
Colbert, the weights being distinctly against him.
Colbert seemed to have a bad run, 'as at Caulfield
the week previous, but it was his own slowness off
the mark that he suffered from. Besides, he is not
brilliant when his chance comes. He’s stodgilv
respectable. Now, a nag with a touch of brilliancy
among welter racers is Sakta, whom some punters
had marked as a good thing for the last event of
an imperfect day. A good thing he was, too.

The seventh round of Sydney grade cricket
started on soft, rain-affected wickets, and not a
single century was recorded. Middle Harbor (169)
appears to be the predestined prey of ’Varsity (two
for 156). Riley (five for 40) got among the M.H.
wickets and had better luck than Trenerry (three for
55). Watts again proved to be Gordon’s mainstay;
against Glebe he got 52 out of the 155 scored bv his
side. Taylor, of Glebe (five for 41), found a wicket
that reallv suited him, and the side has, so far, lost
five for 87 (Morgan 46 n. 0.). Anything may happen
in another fortnight, with Kellewav, possiblv, nlnv-
ing. Sydney compiled a creditable 216 against Bal-
main, Asher making a graceful if lucky 80 and
Smith an unorthodox 41. Folkard’s heady bowling
(six for 72) secured the average. (The majority of
grade batsmen are scared of breaks.) Balmain in
losing but two for 107 (Brown 54 n. 0.) have the
game in their pocket. King’s 83 was top score of
the day, and was made for Norths against Waverley.
The former scored 306,
the fielding of the bone-
yarders becoming demoral-
ised after a time.
O’Keefe’s 44 (for Padding-
ton v. Petersham), out of
a total of 128, was, under
the circs., a wonderful bit
of batting. Adams (four
for 39) and Andrews (five
for 33) had the rest of
the side completely cowed.
Petersham have five out
for 96, and unless Nor-
man finds his punch they
should win easily. Gar
AA r addy (58) was the only
batsman to stem the tide
against AVests, and was
mainly responsible for C.
Cumberland’s 195. AVild,
of AVests (six for 39),
terrorised the rest of the
side. AA’ests are three
down for 113, so that
C.C.’s chance resembles
wet loam.
ALAN KIPPAX,
the Waverley
( Sydney ) batsman.
Paddington (N.S.W.) cricketer Frank
O’Keefe, who is to play v. South Aus. next Satur-
day, has reached the representative stage rapidly.
Before going to the war he occasionally played with
AVaverley in the first grade, but was more often
with the second eleven. Coming home a few
months ago. he found there was no place for him
in first Waverlev team. So he got a permit
to play with Paddington, though still a resident of
Bondi, and quickly demonstrated what he had
strongly suspected—that he was somewhere in the
vicinity of inter-State form.
“See Em”: J. N. Crawford, who played
for S. Aus. for a season or two and left as a sergeant-
major with M.L. reinforcements in 1918, looks like
settling down again in England. His family is
famous for cricketers. His father, a parson, still
plays for the M.C.C. His eldest brother, V.F.S., was
the best schoolboy cricketer of the year in 1896, and
played later for Surrey and Leicestershire. His
other brother, R.T., also played for Leicestershire,
and there was a sister who could bat and possesses
a safe pair of hands in the out-field. >
Nothing annoys
Gerald Patterson more
than the general
assumption that he
learnt all his tennis
from Brookes. His
father was his first
mentor, and he devel-
oped his game at
school. In point of
fact, he was a first-
class player before
Brookes so much
as met him.
J. B. HAWKES , five-
times Public Schools
tennis champion of
Vic., who teas in the
doubles championship
with Wertheim
against Brookes and
Patterson.
The normal advantage of the bat over the
ball is accentuated in big cricket this season by the
mediocrity of the gentlemen behind the leather. Vic.
beat N. S. Wales last week only because of superior
batting on the best of the wicket. Its bowl-
ing was actually inferior to Ma’s in pungency
and variety. McDonald, who is modelling his pace
on that of a Melbourne policeman at three
o’clock on a dull morning, had. some occasional
flashes, but never troubled the defence of men like
Bardsley and Kelleway. Ironmonger, the left-hander,
worried nobody but himself, and his average pro-
bably explained his absence from the caste against
South Aus. As for Ryder, he did well in the first
hits with the aid of wicket-keeper Ellis, but in
the second go of the Sydneysiders he lost touch, and
seemed to be too polite to be dangerous. Armstrong
hasn’t lost his capacity to get wickets, but his habit
of retiring in favor of the colts is injudicious
self-effacement that often gives the enemy runs.
New South’s bowling needs another Cotter.
Norman and Hendry are only fairly reliable
on the points of accuracy and length, and
Mailey’s slows are obvious Delilahs for a Samson
to resist. On their present showing South Aus.
also cannot produce a really riotous disturber of
a batsman's peace. The aggregate punch of the
crowd, Whitty included, will never enable them to
biff their way to the Sheffield Shield. The team is
unfairly burdened with bowlers of the high-pitched
teaser variety, but they haven’t a man with any
devil, bar Whitty, and he often borrows ais
fire from a drying pitch. On the bowling side the
prospects of Australia, look blue for the brush with
the English at the end of this year. On the other
hand, one or two bats are inspiring optimism.
Bardsley’s and Ivelleway’s centuries against Vic-
toria w T ere fine, and promised a rare victory if the
middle of the team had worked as well as the
head and tail. Ma.yne, the ex-South Australian now
playing for Victoria, erected a towering average;
but the ex-Wesley Collegian, Park, sent it tottering.
Park’s record of 92, 77 and 228 for his first three
tries in inter-State cricket this summer is probably
unprecedented.
* * * *
Inter-State cricketers are righteously kick-
ing against the allowances made for bed and board
when they are playing away from home. The Vic-
torians get only 10s. a day, while Ma Staters arc
kept from going gay with ss. per diem. They are all
beginning to feel a bit more fraternal towards the
1.W.W., and there are already dark rumors of a
threatened strike in Victoria. Some at any rate
won’t cross the border in further pursuit of the
Sheffield Shield unless they are guaranteed a pound a
day.
* * * *
In three Sheffield Shield matches N. S.
Wales has scored six centuries and Vic. three. Here
are some of the bowlers’ averages: Whitty, three for
199 ; A. Richardson, one for 194 ; Townsend, none for
132 ; Rundell, three for 230 : Williams, five for 225 :
Lucas, seven for 240. For N. S. Wales, Mailey’s 13
wickets have cost 314, and Norman has taken seven
for 278.
* * * *
The hard-hitting ex-Digger R. L. Park
(Vic.) has an average of 132.66 in Sheffield Shield
matches to date. His 228 has only twice been
exceeded bv a Vic. batsman v. S. Aus. (Armstrong s
250 in 1911 and 231 in 1907).

“Cobber”: There is a good Australian
welcome waiting in Sydney for Ross Smith and his
crew, and numerous individuals who have butted in
to get an advt. (or something) for themselves are
already reckoning on a good time. But why the
Smiths should 1 e directed to bring their machine to
earth in a dirty hole, well away from the public
gaze, I wish one of the local rags would explain.
One yarn is that someone or other with a long, strong
pull and a yearning to sell the Government an
aerodrome site might supply an explanation. The
place allegedly “chosen” for the landing is, at any
rate, in a remote, odoriferous suburb, where the
landscape is usually decorated with newly-flayed sheep-
skins, where there is wretched accommodation for
sightseers, and which has only a transport service
of the wayback variety. It is hopeless for anything
in the nature of a spectacular landing; and in all
the circumstances of the great exploit of the Smith
family, the business looks inexpressibly shabby. No
other suitable place to land! What about Moore
Park? And a dozen men in a dav or two could rmkc
Randwick Racecourse, where 100,000 people could
see the arrival of the travellers, an ideal place for
hopping out of the ’bus.
~ the short, nuggety Filipino, met
the tall and willowy Seccombe at Sydney Stadium
on Saturday night. Seccombe has a reputation
as a Knock-out King in a small wav, but the
colored comedian from the Far North is : too strong
and elusive to be overwhelmed by one of his own
weight who is other than an absolute front-ranker
Hali-way through the journey tiie local lad was so
nearly done as to be harmless. On the other hand
he was not sufficiently enfeebled to give Jamito a
chance of outing him. At the end of 20 earnestly-
contested rounds the Manila man got the decision
on points.
Llew Edwards, of Wales, gave Eddie
Kelly, of America, half a stone and a beating at
Sydney Hippodrome on Monday night. It was a
case of the light-weight first 'and the welter no-
where. In the fifth round Kelly went down and
just managed to rise before “ten” was yelled into
his ear. He fought the next three sessions on the
retreat, and in the ninth was once more felled
whereupon his seconds heaved in the emblem of sur-
render—a step they might well have taken several
rounds earlier. There is only one evident match
tor Kdwards in Australia, as this paper has remarked
before, and his name is Harry Stone. Stone is
more than willing. What about Edwards?
* * * *
The weights for boxing have been varied
a bit by the Amateur Boxing Association of Britain
thus: Heavy, unlimited; light-heavy, not over 12st.
71b. ; middle, up to list. 61b. ; welter, to lOst. 71b ■
light, to 9st. 91b. ; feather, to 9st.; bantam, to
Bst. 61b. ; fly, to Bst. The championships are to be
held at Easter, and a representative English team
sent over to the Olympic games at Antwerp. At the
A.B.A. annual meeting a suggestion to use six-ounce
gloves instead of eight-ounce for the lighter classes
was just not carried. A strong minority, headed by
cricketer J. W. H. T. Douglas, argued that it is
absurd to hamper a boy under 9st. with the padding
needed for a heavyweight.
Norman Ross was the star feature of
N. S. Wales Amateur Swimming Association cham-
pionships at Sydney on Saturday. The tall, straight-
legged Yank, resplendent in bath-robe and fancy
socks, stripped only for the 220yds. title. In this
event he made hacks of the best half-dozen N. S.
Wales could produce. The starters (except Rowell,
who was badly left) took the water together, but
Ross’s well-directed shallow dive put him ahead
straightaway. At 50yds. he had two yards to spare;
the turn (110yds.) saw him leading by six; and at
the finish he touched (say) five yards ahead of the
nearest opponent. Most of. his pace was clapped on
in the first half, a device which broke his pursuers
up so completely that all were rolling badly at the
finish. Ross’s action is heavy but methodical; it
is strength which pulls him through. The time
(2min. 32 4-5 sec.) was slow compared with the
Australian (2min. 28 2-ssec.), English (2min. 28 3-6
sec.), and American (2min. 24 l-ssec.) records.
Keith Kirkland (Uni. and ex-schools’ champion)
finished second and Billy Longworth third. The
rest of the starters were out for the pleasure of the
dip.
In the other championships Sid Beck (Sydney)
took the 100yds. back-stroke in lmin. 16 4-ssec.;
G. Wild (Macksville) won the 100yds. country title
in 63 3-ssec.; and Manly won the 500yds. teams’
championship in smin. 8 l-ssec. The hippy wind
was against fast times.
* * * •
From a “gate” viewpoint, the six-day eight-
hour bike race at Sydney Sports Ground last week
was a huge success. There were about 30,000 in
on the final night (Saturday). But except when
lap prizes were given the proceedings were as dull
as mud. Fifteen teams (two each) started in the
big whirl, and, although rain made the track-
greasy for a time the race was mostly no more
than pleasant exercise for the well-trained athletes.
Throughout the long spell there were only half
a dozen attempts to get a break on the field; but
the “rushers” were overhauled and an even gait
maintained. Such thrills as there were occurred
in the final ten minutes. Just as the pace was
warming up Ohrt (U.S.A.) had a tyre blow-out,
and the rest slowed down and kept their wind
while the rider got his machine fixed up. At three
laps to go, the finessing for position began, and at
the beginning of the last round Mcßeath was
whizzing along in front of Grenda, who kept lookirg
round instead of attending strictly to the business in
hand. . Spencer was hidden behind Grenda’s back
wheel, and 200yds. from the post he suddenly un-
wound his sprint and rushed to the front. He won
by six lengths from Grenda and Mcßeath, the dis-
tance for the time being 910 miles.
Spencer (Canada) is a stylish rider with a
splendid seat. He teamed with C. Osteritter
(U.S.A.), who came to Australia as an amateur,
and, meeting with poor success, shifted after the
cash. They will cut up about, £320 in prize-
money and sprint prizes. Alf Grenda and F. Corry
(both ex-Australians) take the second whack—
£loo.
In the minor events the bright spot was the rid-
ing of young H. Horder, son of old-time champion
George. He won the mile handicap (from 70yds.),
and on Saturday the five-mile scratch provided a
novelty when father and son filled first and second
places.
* * * *
While the Yanks were successful in the
six-day bike whirl at Sydney, Alf Goullet (one-
time of Australia), teaming with Madden, took the
cash of the big six-day event in New York. Goullet
had a leg in the only two six-day events previously
held in Australia and he and P. Hehir put up the
Australian record (2085 miles 1680yds.) at Sydney
in 1912.
Ex-Digger Jack Dixon (of South Aus.)
landed the N. S. Wales 100 miles motor-cycle road
championship at Goulburn last week. He rode a
7h.p. Indian, and left the journey behind in
122 min. 6sec. H. A. Parsons was leading by two
miles when he fell. •

Old-timer Tom Malone, who died at Syd-
ney la.st week, had been a great all-round athlete.
His best efforts were 100yds. in 9 3-ssec.; 175yds.,
; 440yds., 47 3-ssec.; 1000yds., 2min. 14
2-ssec. ; high jump, 6ft. Olio. ; and hop, step and
jump, 48ft. 6in. Malone, who came to Australia in
1882 from County Clare, did much to keep pro-
fessional athletics clean.
ANNIE’S BIG WIN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I once was happy in my home, and with my little
wife,
My little son and simple joys I led a peaceful life.
Now tribulation’s here, existence runs a rugged course
Since Annie won five shillings in a bet upon a
horse.
She much neglects her duties now, she talks to me
a lot
When lights are out of horses and the pedigrees
they’ve got.
She wakes me up to tell me how old Honeymoon will
win,
And that Baron broke a record in a. recent trial
spin.
Now Annie wastes a lot of time to hear the baker’s
boy
Enlarging on performances of Bolger’s Nell of Troy,
Or talking with the butcher’s ma 1 who has a brother
who
Meets someone in a stable, and he knows a thing
or two.
My stew is often left to burn, the pudding feft to
dry,
While Annie reads the sporting news, and has another
try
To spot a winner. Both my feet are grinding on
the flags,
My trousers need some patches and my shirts are
only rags.
My wife she hasn’t time to mend, for if you’re wise,
she says,
And bet upon a system, backing horses always pavs.
Jf 1 should make a loud complaint, she smiles till I
have done,
Then tells me in a lofty way of five bob once she
won.
She often goes to races with the Browns across the
way,

KEYS TO HEALTH AND STRENGTH!
sf
My Scientific Exercises are keys to Health and Strength.
Your health and strength depend upon exercise. Exercise
is the judicious movement of the organs of the body, so
that they will NOT become flabby through want of use. When
an organ becomes flabby it cannot carry out its functions
in a natural way. It goes from bad to worse. Eventually
it is a source of never-ending annoyance—then chronic
ill-health.
Judicious exercise is the key of Health. It cuts out
monotony, accomplishes permanent results quickly, takes
up very little time—every movement goes right to the spot.
My Postal Course of Health
and Strength Exercises
will make you fit and keep you strong and healthy.
The exercises you receive will bo most suited to your
individual needs just as the particulars you furnish tell me
you require.
M rite your name and address across this advertisement
and send it to me with three stamps, and 1 will send you
a copy of my interesting booklet, “Health and Strength
from Self-Culture.”
I hose desiring to avail themselves of personal instruction at
my Institute are invited to call and have a that with me
about their needs, when I shall be happv to show them over
my modern and perfectly-appointed establishment.

NOT an Experiment!
The Australian Wool Clip is not a thing to be ex-
perimented with. It was with the fullest recognition
of that fact, and only after years of exhaustive tests,
that “Vallo”—an-Arsenical Dip of the highest quality—•
was placed on the market with a definite pledge to
the Government of its equality to the best Dip ever
offered the Australian Woolgrower.
Powder SHEEP DIP
is an ideal realised. The genuine confidence and
enthusiasm with which it is now being used all over
the Commonwealth is sound evidence that “Vallo” is
a Perfect Dip. When will your flock start enjoying
its effectiveness, its long-lasting protection? NOW?

Although they are reluctant to say so
publicly, lest it should appear that they are
inhospitable or “disloyal,” all sorts and con-
ditions of people, including responsible pub-
lic men, are wishing that the visit of the
heir-apparent could be deferred for a year.
In a whisper these people will tell you that
this is a time for taking off coats and work-
ing solidly till things get straightened out
a bit after the war. Neither Governments
nor ordinary people have any money to
burn, and it will be paying a poor compli-
ment to the Digger to hobnob with vulgar
profiteers. Additional taxation is certain
to be imposed by the Commonwealth, and
the announcement will be followed by a
demand for economy. It is said that the
Australian editors who were called to Lon-
don in 1918 were consulted on the question
of a Royal visit, and that almost with one
accord they recommended that it should not
be undertaken for two or three years.
Apparently the Canadian experience per-
suaded the Colonial ‘Office to follow other
advice.
Discussion is already raging in official
circles on the “honors” which are likely to
be the outcome of the Prince’s visit. The
Governor-General is looked on as a cer-
tainty for a peerage (it can be taken as
read that his term will be extended), and
N. S. Wales Governor Davidson ought to
get a step. Both of them belong to the new
order of viceroy. Their respectability is
tremendous. They work like tigers. A can-
didate for a doubtful constituency only has
to be affable for a few weeks every three
years: these astonishing men keep it up all
the time. Government House is no longer
the resort chiefly of the frivolous and the
fair, as in the days of flaneurs such as
Hampden and Dudley. The thoroughly
worthy predominate nowadays, and worthi-
ness is mostly dull; which makes the insis-
tent cheeriness of the G.-G. all the more
admirable.
The G.-G.’s friend. James Burns, head of
the great shipping firm, is tipped for a
baronetcy. He has given large sums to war
and other funds. Federal Chief Justice
Knox is considered another certainty for the
same distinction if he wants it. There is
talk of singling out a prominent Jew for
behandlement in each capital, though the
present Royal Family is not enamored of
the race, and though, on the whole, the
Jews have not given notably during the last
five years. There are in Melbourne and
Sydney half a dozen more or less dark
horses of the Christian persuasion. Their
recommendations will depend on their find-
ing some popular fund and pouring cash into
it within the coming two or three months.
A sensational donation putting one of the
great hospitals on its legs financially is con-
sidered to be about the surest winner offer-
ing. Mr. Hugh R. Denison, of Sydney, got
in early with £25.000 towards the' building
fund of the Royal Colonial Institute in
London.
On coming back to his home-city General
Monash, after being accorded a welcome that
was almost worthy of his great deeds, adopted
the Washingtonian manner. If there were
other public duties within the scope of his
abilities that he could perform, he said, Gov-
ernments and public bodies could easily
ascertain his address. He sought nothing.
Having finished his military and demobilisa-
tion job he was ready to go back to his
old work of civil engineering. In fact, he
wanted to follow the advice he had given to
others —“Have a rest to get fit; then go
back to work, and trouble the Government
as little as possible.” If he were offered the
Chief Commissioner-ship of Railways in a
whole-hearted manner he would probably
take it —provided Norman stayed for three
months to give him some hints on technicali-
ties.
Monasli’s handsome spouse has returned
to her native city a very sick woman. She
walks or rises from her chair with great
difficulty, and it required a heap of pluck
for her to climb from a naval tender, stand
about listening to mayoral oratory, and make
the long journey up St. Kilda pier, through
a crowd of cheering Diggers, on the day
she returned. Daughter Bertha and her
soldier fiancfi formed themselves into a body-
guard to make her passage as easy as pos-
sible, and the lady wore a brave smile to
the end.
The car which brought Mrs. Monash,
daughter Bertha and fiance Bennett up to
town was a moving bouquet, and the ladies
of the Purple Cross carried out their par-
ticular color scheme at the hotel.
The Monash dame has terrifying tales to
tell about the cost of living in London. A
small flat and attendance cost £2O a week,
and when she engaged two small bedrooms
and a tiny sitting-room at a moderately
fashionable hotel she was told that the
damage would be £lOO a week. None of the
leading hotels would agree to book rooms
for three months, as they reckon there is
more coin to be made out of casual visitors
who bide a brief while and depart to make
room for a fresh consignment ~of plutocrats.
Willie Watt has joined the Right Honor-
ables, and is one of a trinity in the Cabinet,
Hughes and Jocook being the other two. He
could of course have had a kuighthood,
but shied. Nobody grudges him the prece-
dence he will be entitled to at “functions,”
though as P.C. he will come in ahead even
of baronets not to mention mere knights.
George Turner (who like Watt ran the
Treasury and represented Balaclava) found
the filigree about his name something of a
nuisance when he left public life, but he was
overjoyed one night when he recollected that
he was a J.P. (by virtue of being a Vic.
Executive Councillor) —an old friend who
was in a fix wanted a declaration signed.
When Watt retires to his citrus orchard at
Tresco he may have a similar experience, as
he also is a similar kind of J.P.
There was little cavilling at the Manifold
knighthood. Having become President of
the Council, the poor man had to put up
with it. Of course Melbourne Club is joy-
ful, although there is a fairly str#ng section
which shares the quiet contempt for name-
handles displayed by Donald Mackinnon,
the club president. If by any chance
Sachse had been put in the chair of the
Dreary House, it is a million to one pre-
cedents would have been broken and there
would have been no title.
Premier Lee, Tasmania’s New Year
knight, is considered a brave man to accept
the bauble, since the only occupation he has
followed apart from politics has been that
of a village blacksmith. Tassy wonders if
he is thinking of the job of Agent-General
when Ashbolt is finished with it.
Having become bored with things in Aus-
tralia again, Victor Nelson Hood is going
over to Bronte, his little estate in Sicily,
for a spell, or even to stop there perma-
nently. This is the second or third time he
has gone there, or said he was going there,
in recent years. Perhaps the new Gover-
nor, whoever he may be, may reach out and
bring him back sooner or later. Hood is
not a persona grata with State officials,
and frankly they won’t mind if he never
returns. Presumably Neil Smith will act
as private sec. for Lieut.-Governor Irvine
for the balance of his Ex.’s term.
Driving over from the State Shack at
Macedon, Lieut.-Governor Irvine and his
dame saw the races at picturesque Hanging
Rock on New Year’s Day. He mixed with
a crowd of 10,000 or thereabouts, most of
whom did not care tuppence which nag won
or lost. Of course, there was a reception
and some toasting, during which his Ex.
bracketed the scene and the crowd as unique.
Probably half the throng went home unaware
that Ptami had won the Cup. Are Aus-
tralians really so mad on racing as some
critics make out?
Herewith a recent view by S. R. Shier
of Miss Barbara Armstrong, lately ex^
alted to the post of
editress of The
Woman, which
voices the sacred
longings and antipa-
thies of the Women’s
National League,
Miss Armstrong is a
daughter of the late
King Armstrong, one
time (it was a long
time ago) pro-
trietor of the Age and
later founder of Kyne-
ton Guardian. When
the old man died his
capable daughter
and her brothers
kept the pap e r
going. Prior to that
Miss Armstrong was
school-teaching in Kyneton and developing
her voice and those debating powers which
she was afterwards to use for the Wimmen’s
League. She has been 15 years connected
with that powerful body, five of them as
president of the Kyneton branch. During
the war she doubled her working day to
get bags of cash for the Comforts Fund
and Red Cross.
That Lieut.-Gov. Michael O’Dwyer, whose
firmness, as boss man in the Punjab, has
given umbrage to the Nationalist Indians,
is a brother to Father J. O’Dwyer, S.J., of
Svdney, who was formerly rector of Xavier
and first rector of Newman College within
Melbourne Uni.
With loads of good wishes and improved
health, Peter Mcßride left by the Orvieto to
resume his job as Agent-General. Because
of the high cost of living in London, Peter
will draw £1750 instead of £l5OO a year,
aud travelling allowances will be slightly
better.
The Donald Mackinnoms are surfing at
Mallacoota. They usually go to Tasmania;
but the shipping-engineers’ strike kept them
from crossing Bass Strait this time.
This is a Vandyck study of Mary Mack,
a young Melbourne contralto who is rapidly
qualifying for a place among the fixed stars.
A pupil of the com-
petent O. F. Sobell
at the L T ni. Conser-
vatorium, she has
already annexed
one of the Ormond
Exhibitions and her
Diploma of Music,
and this year
joins the voice-pro-
ducing squad at the
aforesaid seat of
learning. Miss Mack
is a daughter of a
Wester n District
squatter, and during
the war she and five
others spent all
vacations warbling
for various patriotic
funds. The result
was £l3OO worth of comforts for the Diggers.
Ralph Gibbs and his wife have come to
Melbourne. lie is to join the Gibbs-Engh-
firm here. Melbourne is ready to fall on Ins
neck, for he is a nephew of Lord Aldenham
and a cousin of Major Evelyn Gibbs wn i
married a niece of Queen Mary.
Mrs. Langlands Thomson (she was the
widow Langlands Jack) is back at her
South Yarra home arranging a lot of foreigu
furnishings—lampshades, screens, carpets
and other trifles. She is very excited over
the fact that she travelled across America
within coo-ee of the Prince of Wales!
Leonie Peterson, who married General
Mackworth, was to spend Christmas in
Switzerland with her husband. Lately she
was staying with her sister-in-law, the Vis-
countess Rhonnda, in Wales. The Mack-
worths have a house at Maresfield in Sussex,
where they intend to settle for a time —the
General has been made Chief Instructor in
Army Signalling. He went to Gallipoli
with* the Australians at the outset, and was
then in Palestine on Allenby’s staff. He
was mentioned in despatches 10 times, and
after the Armistice was on Lord French’s
staff in Dublin. Little Leonie, you may
remember, put up her school pigtails for
her bridal wreath just before the war.
Popular John Sanderson, who lately
announced his intention of vacating the Aus-
tralian end of his shipping business to take
control of the London office, has dashed back
to the Commonwealth to settle up his affairs,
included in which is the sale of his Toorak
place Brie-Brie.
Leila, youngest of the Como Armytage
sisters, who has been living in England for
years, is coming back to Australia directly
she can get a passage. Her sister, Mrs. Fitz-
patrick, will probably accompany her. Cap-
tain Fitzpatrick (at least lie used to be
Captain—he may lie General now) was on
the State vice-regal staff before his marriage
nearly 15 years ago.
Parson Brown, the imported head of Gee-
long Grammar, is tracking off early in March
with his wife to see how his native Eng-
land looks after the war. The name of his
understudy has not yet been divulged.
Mrs. Andrew got back to Melbourne last
week after 20 years on the other side of
the equator. As Edith Kiddle she was in
the first division of the Toorak battle-fleet.
While she was travelling in Europe a wealthy
Englishman persuaded her to stay and share
his name and bank account.
Adelaide passes the gossip:—
The new Mayoral Mouldens gave a cheery New
Year entertainment, most of the guests being young-
people who jazzed until midnight and then crowded
out on the Town Hall balconies to pelt the crowd
below with confetti. The hall was kept cool for
dancing with big blocks of ice, in which flowers and
fern were frozen, and over which electric fans drove
a cool draught.
Among the passengers who arrived by the Orsova
was Dr. Dorothea Pavy. As Dorothea Sprod she
was chosen first Spence scholar in 1912, later study-
ing sociology in England and writing a book, “Wel-
fare Work,” to which Lloyd George contributed the
foreword. She took the degree of Doctor of Social
Science in 1917. During the war she worked in
the Welfare Department of the Ministry of Muni-
tions, and returns to us still a fresh-faced girl with
the old size in hats.
Under the will of Edwin Smith, who died on
Christmas Day, Congregational Church institutions
get £5OOO, and a further £15,000 is distributed
among charities in which he was interested. Angli-
can, R.C. and Salv’army institutions are all included.
Mollie, third daughter of the lioonoona Hawkes
couple, has become engaged to Gordon Law Smith,
youngest son of the late grossly-rich “Dickie”
Smith, of Glenelg; and Nancy Muirhead, only
daughter of the late John Muirhead, has made a
date with Roy, only surviving son of Mr. and Mrs,
C. Temple.
Erica Chaplin the other day won the Elder
Scholarship, which gives her three years’ tuition at
the London Royal Academy. It was this prize that
first took Daisy Kennedy to England.
Marjorie Back and Charlie Duffy were
married close upon Christmas at the little
B.C. chapel in Toorak. A cousin cleric from
Maoriland and Father Guy Duffy put them
through.
Lieut. Wallace Hamilton, the Claude
Hamiltons’ son-and-heir, has just tied up
with an English girl, Elsie Mitchell. The
lieutenant’s mother is a sister of Dr. !• red
Bird.
The late Judge- Molesworth’s youngest
daughter, (Enone (they all had Tennysonian
names), is now a pianist in London. A
recent recital set the critics purring. Her
husband died very tragically a few years
ago.
The sensation of a dull week was sup-
plied by the new management at the Orien-
tal, which politely intimated to three theat-
rical ladies that their rooms were required
for other guests. The new government had
been in office only a few hours when the
ultimatum was issued, and the indignation
of the ladies (two recently-arrived panto
stars and a much-discussed musical com-
edienne) was such as no stage manager
would care to face. They regard the demand
that they should evacuate as an insult to
the profesh, which view is supported by
prominent greasepainters. The reason put
forward by the pub may be genuine, but it
is suspected of nursing an ambition to be-
come the Mecca of only the Very Naicest
people, and women who work for their
living are perhaps not Very Naice. Semi-sas-
siety folk are now wondering whether the
abolition of jazz parties will be another
plank in the new management’s policy.
The Frederic Shipmans just escaped star
parts in a tragedy. After leaving Penang
their steamer Fazilka ran into a cyclone.
The second officer on the bridge at 3 a.m.
saw what he thought to be a black cloud.
It proved to be a rock. A light-
ning bit of seamanship slewed the vessel
from striking nose on. As it was she went
firmly aground. Passengers were hurried
out of their berths. Pitch dark and rain-
ing heavily, lifeboats out and provisioned
and wireless begging everything afloat to
come and save the Fazilka’s souls. The
Mytilus, an oil-tanker, was the first to
respond. About noon came the West Modus.
The transfer of passengers was effected —
vessels a mile apart, and then a long ?ope
ladder up the reeling side of the oil-tanker.
A fine voyage the rest of the journey to
Colombo. Turned out that the Fazilka had
been typhooned 35 miles out of her course
and was on the Nicobars.
Pianist Dorothy Murdoch has been handed
a cheque for £416 as the result of her recent
benefit, and a further £5O will be waiting for
her -in London, where she has arranged to
give joint concerts with Stella Power.
Flo Young had to have her face stitched
as the result of a motoring accident. She
was with the Tallis lady and Reg Roberts
when the car got the worst of an encounter
with a gatepost at Mornington. The wind
screen was smashed, and Flo acquired a
nasty gash under the left eye.
There was another raid on the Savoy last
week. Hugh Mclntosh was having a supper
party after “Petticoat Fair.” But of course
his lot were not amongst those who either
scuttled or insisted that their name was
John Smith.
This year the Taits have dressed their
panto of “Mother Hubbard” in carmine and
brown. The latter color pervades the worka-
day tights of Marjorie Carlisle, and there
are hints of it in her second-best, which
suggests an overdone curry with a glistening
tunic made of the frozen gravy. Carmine
figures profit,sely in the wardrobe of the
ballet and rather shrills the effect of “The
Pipes of Pan,” wherein the unprecipitate
coryphees nod to an incongruous Yankee rag.
Elsie Parkes is the lovely flower in this
diversion, and her fine feathered waistcoat
as the pheasant victim of the fox demolishes
all memories of the pretentious plumage of
a similar fowl in “The Sleeping Beauty."
Daisy Yates, however, is the only dress-made
divinity to justify the skill and care of her
creator. A white frock with a skirt built
of seven terraces of foam mortgages the eye
longer than seems polite. Also there is an
all-black confection which provides gleams
of a pink and rounded Daisy through the
lacy ventilation of the dinkiest pantalettes.
Mrs. Robert Brough-Bell and her husband
(he now wears the trappings of a naval
lieutenant) saw “Theodore and Co.” from a
box on Friday evening, with a couple of
friends. She was warmly applauded by the
few who recognised the star of long ago.
The newest panto dame, Marriott Edgar,
has just exchanged khaki for greasepaint.
He held a commission with the British
Army in France.
London papers announce the death of Sir
Ernest Albert Waterlow, a painter against
whom nothing was known except that he
was a Royal Academician. His chief claim
to notice so far as Australia is concerned is
that his second wife (now his first widow)
was Marion Burton, whom old-time theatre-
goers remember for her engaging work in
the memorable production of “Paul Jones’
in 1890.

A WOMAN'S
LEŢER
DAVID
JONES
FOR
SMART
MILLINERI
captain Grigg, who is coming to Aus-
tralia on the Prince of Wales’s staff as “poli-
tical adviser” or speech-inspirer, is an Aus-
tralian on his mother’s side. She was a Miss
I)eas Thomson, of Sydney, who married
Henry Grigg, a brilliant young Indian civil
servant, 40-odd years ago. He died early,
and their only son Edward went to Win-
chester with a scholarship. Later on he
won another scholarship (at New College,
Oxford), and took the Gainsford Greek verse
prize at the University in his last year. In
France he was G.S.O. with the Guards Divi-
sion, an astonishing circumstance in the
case of a civilian, however capable. Before
the war he was a London journalist: he
came to Australia in 1908 to investigate the
political situation and things generally on
behalf of the Times. As a side-line he is
an authority on Wagner.
Another member of the Prince’s staff who
has Australian relations and who knows the
lay of the land, socially, as well as any man
is Commander Dudley North. He married
Eglantine Campbell, of Sydney, a daughter
of the M.L.C. and a sister of Stirling Camp-
bell, who died the other day.
The Richards lady, with her title brand-
new upon her, was one of the visitors to
Randwick on New Year’s Day, and what
was probably her first congratulatory party
was the tea-drinking in the afternoon given
by Mrs. Barnes, wife of the chairman of Tat-
tersall’s Club.
There was a fresh breeze blowing
in Sydney on New Year’s Day, so
the small boy in his Glengarry cap,
his kilt and his plaidies fastened proudly
with the family cairngorm was not so
meltingly hot as otherwise he must have
been; and it gave a fine flutter to
the tartan as the pipers took their stands
upon the green enclosure where the caber
was tossed and the stone was putt as in the
days of Roderick Dhu. Sonsy lasses with
hair a-blow wore the kilt with a waggle, and
when not engaged in dancing the Highland
Fling or the Seann Triubheas (and that
sounds like acute trouble in Ireland) watched
with arms akimbo and a sternly critical eye
the attempts of the mere male to execute the
sword dance. _ Among the laddies dashing
off their caps in a final frenzy occasionally
flashed a slim, blue-eyed redhead who might
have been Bonnie Prince Charley before that
young man was smitten with general dissolu-
tion. But whether he wore the tartan of a
blameless life or merely accentuated his
nationality by a sprig o’ heather (ye could
get that gratis) or a large artichoke thistle-
nead in his buttonhole, whether he was of
Inverness or Dumbarton, of Aberdeen or
Edinburgh, your 30,000-strong Highlander
disported himself with abounding jov among
the extensive advertisements for whisky with
which the Agricultural Grounds are spat-
tered.
The official luncheon was a wonderful
affair with its cairngorm-jewelled sheep’s
head and its dish o’ haggis. Governor David-
son, in the absence of the Munro Ferguson,
didn’t flinch an eyelash, but stuck to the fare
goaded, no doubt, by the eve of the Mac-
kellar and the Burns knights. The Burns
knight, by the way, had brought his own
cheers with him, for the youngsters of the
Burnside Home were there and raised a
forceful voice in greeting when he arrived—
as well they might. At half-past two the
Lady Helen with her Highlander and Aide
Duncan appeared on the scene in time to
witness the finish of the chariot race between
two thinly-thatched Ben Hurs; and the
Davidson lady, in spite of the heather mix-
ture of her surroundings, contrived to look
like a stately home of England.
The display of women’s work occupied a
large pavilion. Herb were all kinds of needle-
work, plain and fancy, some wonderful
crochet and some exquisite point-lace. There
were cakes and sweeties, too; in one corner
women sat spinning, and in another hung a
marvellous example of patience in a woollen
quilt combining the colors of every British
regiment. It had taken Corporal Kelly 17
years to stitch it together.
In the evening as many of the 30,000 Scots
as could packed themselves into the Town
Hall for the concert that was the final
crown and glory of the 1920 celebration.
The G.-G.’s in full regalia were there; with
them sat slim, well-groomed Cecily CatteraO
blushingly pleased to be with her young man
Duncan. S’Ronald, looking very handsome
in the kilt of his clan and wearing a regu-
lar breastplate of orders, bade farewell to
the Campbells and the Macdonalds, the
Stuarts and the Mackays, who stamped and
cheered their brither Scot, and the pipes
could scarcely be restrained trom wailing
"Jmchaber No More” to show the depth of
grief to which his going reduced them. This
is the fifth year the Munro Ferguson and his
lady have been with the New Sou’ Wales
Highlanders; and this time their presence
is due to the breakdown of passenger ship-
ping between Melbourne and the Apple Isle.
There is not likely to be a sixth. After the
farewell John Lemmone, like some Arcadian
shepherd, fluted silver sweetness to the
troubled souls of all, and Bessie Fraser,
who was all for Dundee to be up with his
Bonnets, almost brought down the house.
The carnival spirit pervaded Coogee.
Small girls and babies, fond uncles and
honeymoon couples haunted the switchback
and the Ferris wheel, while the penny-in-the-
slot fortune-teller was the Mecca of the
flapper. A.J.C. and Tattersall’s meetings were
completely outdone by the donkey-races, in
which each nag was ridden by a well-known
jockey. Coogee had its “Perfect Lover” the
other evening. He walked amongst the multi-
tude, and the first to recognise him was handed
a five-pound voucher. Saturday’s gold-rush
outdid Ivlondyke, mum, dad and baby joining
in the hunt. A young man in a straw hat
had the luck of it: he walked nonchalantly
to a hole and drew out a 10-shilling voucher.
Then he proceeded to another spot and un-
earthed a 10-pound voucher. He became a
Figure, as famous for his hour as the Man
That Broke the Bank at Monte Carlo. Funds
from the Carnival go to the St. John Ambu-
lance.
The monster urns bubbled for the last
time at the Soldiers’ Welcome alongside St.
Andrew’s on New Year’s Eve, and the part-
ing cups were handed out by regretful
helpers to a roomful of old friends. Choris-
ters from next door raised a thin pipe that
somehow failed to gladden the event, and
the Archgaiters appeared just in time to call
the blessing. His arrival flustered one of
the guests, who stood up and beefed out the
opening notes of God Save, but subsided in
confusion. Saddest of all perhaps was Chap-
lain Pitt-Owen, who has made the Welcome
his special care. Gentle Mrs. Chisholm, of
Kantara fame, called in to say “Well
done!” to the work of the girl who stayed at
home; and Mrs. Wright lent a Gothic atmos-
phere to the gathering.
This is a Sidney Riley portrait of Ellie
Wray, who gained honors for elocution at
the recent Trinity
College exams. A
pupil of Miss Grace
Stafford, she will
take over the studio
during the chief’s
visit to foreign
parts. Miss Wray
did her bit during
the ’flu epidemic in
the haunts of Wool-
loomooloo. Contract-
ing the disease the
plucky little elocu-
tionist just missed
saying good-bye to
her career. Having
discovered her voice
again, she finds in
this a compensation
for the enforced
Buster Brown crop of her curly head.
Though Cronulla may have its peaches,
Manly is the jazz centre of the season. Dun-
go wan, the latest word in flats, saw the New
Year in in the company of Sydney’s Best,
second-best and also-climbing. All the visi-
tors at the expensive hotels on the Ocean
Beach, being defrauded even at the eleventh
hour of jazz at their own pubberies, set forth
in search of one-step and tickle-toe at Dun-
gowan. But an obdurate management
turned a cold eye on the guest from the high-
way and byway, and refused admission to
all who had not reserved a table. However,
as the night wore on vigilance grew slacker,
and determined merrymakers slipped in and
danced 1920 well on its way.
On the Nicht itself the Pacific kept its
guests tethered to its own back yard by im-
porting the Mosman band to supply jazz in
the courtyard. Our most-talked-of Best
formed a strong post near the music. Most
of the older women had gone as book
titles, and, strangely enough, all chose
to represent Mr. Curie’s delight, “The
Shadow Show.” The transparent tulle or
ninon drapings descended to the ankle or
thereabouts, but the silk or satin slip of
their dresses finished much earlier, so that
none of the sleekness of a silk-clad, well-
turned leg was lost to the multitude. The
effect was quaintly Mr. Pickwick-like in the
case of one well-nourished belle whose legs
jazzed the night through. But it was the
man in the elongated white Eton jacket
that fascinated all. One young man fixed
the pirouetting back with an owl-like eye:
“That’s what I like to see, nice and frien’ly
—head-waiter making it sociable for the
girls. I like that coat, too, fits him nice
and snug across the kidneys, don’t it?”
Then after a reflective pause: “Mus’ ask
him to bring me a ‘spot’ when the dance is
over.” But it wasn’t the head waiter. It
was Captain Cumberlege, of the Australia, in
a white mess jacket. Mrs. Sep Levy had
encased herself in a jet cascade, and hoisted
a pair of emerald-green stockings for the
occasion; Mrs. Tom Dixson was in black
tulle; a weary-looking Mrs. Philip Morton
sustained drapings of dull gold; a Morton
girl looked like a satin-clad vestal virgin;
the good-looking Mrs. Henry Hill Osborne
moved in yellow; Marjorie Quinn was
frilled to the waist; Dr. Stuart McKay and
Clarry Bridge and a Falkiner helped to
cheer the lasses; Captain Gilbert Nobbes had
brought his little missus, who has the com-
plexion of a rose-leaf and the long, almond-
shaped eyes that artists rave over, and who
accentuated her coloring by a yellow man-
darin coat; Mrs. Nelson clashed a ton or
two of jet as she moved, and the sprite-like
Mrs. Everett brought a Paquin frock and a
soldier husband.
The learned Migs Badlxam has had a
second visit to Lister Hospital and a second
operation on the poisoned thumb. Trouble
started in a cut that became septic during
the lady’s ministrations to a sick duck.
Noel Stephen, son of the late Seppy, and a
younger brother of Colin, chairman of the
A.J.C., is just back after five years’ service
in the R.N. He was in England when the
war began, volunteered for the Army, and
was rejected. Finally he pushed into the
Navy and did his bit there. The other
brother—cavalry captain and an “Old Con-
temptible”—fought with his regiment through
the worst of the early days in France.
The Tirranna Race Club has issued in-
vitations for the Picnic meeting which used
to be an annual event until the war. Racing
will occur on Thursday and Friday, the Bth
and 9th inst., and the ball in Goulburn is
to be revived.
Some well-known Sydney owners—Sam
Hordern and others—are sending up horses.
Among the well-known horsemen to nopii-
nate are Pat Osborne and Frank Blomfield
(who is still suffering from the effects of
his riding accident of years ago) ; and the
Faithfuls, Gibsons and other well-known
local families are represented.
. Mabel Webb, one of the founders of the
Peter Pan Club, returned from London lately
after an absence of five and a half years.
She illustrated the child’s book, “Curly
Locks,” which was written by Ruth Bedford
grand-daughter of late Chief Justice Stephen!
It was to arrange about further publications
that Miss Webb went to London, but her
plans were smashed by the war. Five years
were spent, instead, in munition work. And
now, somehow, she isn’t nearly as keen on
Art.
Another link in the chain of the Entente
Cordtule was forged in October, when Kathleen
Mugliston became the wife of Paul Bedat
of the Army of France. Bride is daughter
of the late Dr. Mugliston, barrister and
physician, and Mrs. Mugliston, of Neutral
Bay. She nursed in French hospitals for
over three years, and when her health gave
way changed into the uniform of England’s
Women’s Land Army. Her brothers also
served ; one died with the A.I.F. in France,
the other wore pips with the R.F.A. from
start to finish.
Rev. John Paterson tied the knot. at. St.
Andrew’s, Parramatta, between May Burnet
daughter of the late Lieut.-Col. Burnet and
Mrs. Burnet, of Ryde, and Charles Fraser,
son of the J. A. Frasers, of Ryde. Bride’s
sister Amy was bridesmaid.
The Orontes took off C. E. Tilley, for-
merly demonstrator in geology under Pro-
fessor David at Sydney Uni. In September.
1916, Tilley went to England and was
assistant-manager of a munition-making
plant at Chester. He returned to Sydney
after the Armistice, and during the last few
weeks has been wandering around collecting
Plutonic rocks and other pets of his. These
he takes to the Cold Country in order to
work in petrology at Cambridge University.
He won in Sydney the Science Research
Scholarship of the 1851 Exhibition, and that
means two years of delight at an “accredited
university.”
Lady Dudley is in mourning for her
mother. She was formerly Mrs. Charles
Gurney, wife of a member of the famous
Quaker family. When he died she married
the exact opposite of a Quaker —Colonel
Stracey-Clitherow, a fashionable soldier of
fortune, who took part in the Jameson Raid
and was seized by Kruger. The leading
raiders —mostly Guards officers —were tried
in London later on, and became social lions
in consequence.
Another Sydney girl is booked to marrv
a rubber planter up north. Joan, only
daughter of the Champions, of Bungendore
(he was one time headmaster of King’s
School), has promised to wed Charles Mat-
thew. a young Scotchman she met in India.
I ather and mother will accompany their
chick to India about March next to see
the marriage through.

praise for general-manager King-Salter now
away on long leave at the end of his second
term. A member of the Corps of Na\”l
Constructors, when he arrived from Chat
ham, early in 1914. Australia knew it had
secured a big man •
but it took the trials
and troubles of
Cockatoo to show
just how big. Ho
was always fair, and
in spite of number-
less petty worries
and annoyances he
managed to get
things done. The
spoilt union child
was always crying
on his office door-
step with a handful
of rivets or a demar-
cation stri k e, and
the departmental
cogs overhead
turned too slowly
for the busy expert.
But he never lost his temper, and in spite
of everything the ships slid down the ways.
His pet subject is the dynamic balancing
of rotating masses, and his contributions
on that frivolous subject are quite famous
in professional circles. It seems that the
mystery of rotating masses is of particular
interest to people who make propellers. The
photo is by Judith Fletcher.
Before leaving for the South last week
with her son Dennis Connelly, who has
come back from England to join The Bul-
letin’s staff in Melbourne, Mrs. Harry
Peters extended the glad hand to a number
of friends at the Australia. There was a
full gathering of relatives—the Hunters and
the Aitkens, including the vivacious Miss
Aitlien, who in March marries Dr. Harry
Harris, a Macquarie-street specialist.
Roland Foster, of the Conservatorium,
had a laurel wreath fitted on at the Novem-
ber meeting of the Society of English Singers
when he was elected an hon. member and
received a vote of thanks for his sugges-
tions in connection with the work of the
society. The society’s membership, limited
to 100, comprises the leading English gingers,
teachers and scientific authorities, its object
being “to raise the standard of vocal teach-
ing and bring about the recognition of the
English language as its natural basis.”
The Auxiliary Hospital at George’s Heights
has celebrated its last Christmas under mili-
tary care; next year will see the Navy in
charge. A Christmas-tree was the chief
attraction, and Chief Justice Cullen and his
lady, who is President of the local Red
Cross, distributed gifts. Afterwards there
was dancing and a kind southerly.
The Orsova brought Captain Malcolm
Finlayson, A.M.C., who left Sydney three
and a half years ago with the young doctors
who took the accelerated course. Whea de-
mobbed he became house surgeon at Bradford
Military Hospital. He’s a son of the Robert
Finlay sons of Wollongong—pa used to be
manager of the E. S. and A. Bank.
History repeated itself at the Apollo
Club’s concert at the Conservatorium, when
Ella Caspers and Arthur Benjamin renewed
acquaintance. They had not met since the
pianist, a small boy in an Eton suit,
played Chopin numbers at the contralto’s
first concert in Brisbane 10 or 12 years ago.
prior to her departure for England. Out
of that concert came another star, Eileen
Beattie, a sister of Bessie, accompanist for
J.C.W. musical cos. The infant prodigy of
All Hallows Convent, Eileen won a scholar-
ship for violin at the London College of
Music. At present she is touring America
as solo pianist and accompanist with Isolde
Menges, the English violinist.
Mrs. Dormer, once Miss Toohey, who has
just returned to Sydney with her two chil-
dren, will leave shortly on a visit to her hus-
band’s coffee plantation at Nairobe. The
bairns will stay with grandma.
An Outback station-owner brought his
most valuable horse to greener fields the
other day in the family Rolls-Royce. It
took some managing; but the animal was
worth a couple of thousands, and railway
trucks seemed as far off as Peace.

Is simply a correctly poised body induced
by a correctly designed and fitted corset.
If every woman will take a little time to
consider modern hygienic corsetry —just
enough so she may purchase her corset and
wear it with the full understanding of its
possibilities —she will attain without effort
what every woman values: style , comfort ,
and that greatest of all nature’s gifts—
health.
Every Gossard Corset is hygienically cor-
rect. Properly fitted to the figure for which
it was designed, it will give scientific support
to abdominal and back muscles, with no
chance of undue pressure at the waistline;
the organs of nutrition will be free from
pressure; the erect posture which is induced
will encourage deep breathing and the
diaphragmatic muscles become strong with
use. A woman so corseted will have the
undeniable beauty of health and that grace
of movement which is best expressed in the
one word — style.

We wish to stress the fact that ECONOMY is one of the chief attributes of
Bostock Shoe Dressings. It is economical by virtue of the fact that it is more
than a mere polish.
Containing, as it does, ingredients which nourish and preserve the leather, it gives
longer life to footwear.
With the cost of shoes mounting

of Bostock’s, with its leather-
preserving qualities, is particu-

the genuine all-weather-
proof “M'atta” Fabric.

ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS.
Ko notice (except of a hostile character ) will be
taken of communications insufficiently stamped.
Name and address must appear on the MSS. No
liability is undertaken re contributions volun-
tarily submitted; and no MS. will be returned
unless stamps accompany.
Ted T.: Quite likely. The Bulletin
hasn’t yet had experience of a statement made by
an airman that some other airman hasn’t challenged.
Scaler: If that’s so, somebody has been risking
a long spell in gaol, the importation of German
pencils being still prohibited... .639: Merely a hand-
ful of words dumped on to paper... .Toy Wheel.
Might do if you made the last verse stronger
G.M.L.: “The Beer Strike” is a dreary effort....
T.11.E.C.: Your verses don’t show any signs of find-
ing their way to print... . A.T.A.: “The Last Re-
sort” is the basket. .. .Sparking Plug (Eng.): Don’t
welcome parodies... .Cape Pork: Wrong; The
Bulletin did publish the yarn. That was long
ago and it was the famous gag’s first appearance.
Riglak: None of them up. By the way, won’t
your machine type more clearly? Exiled Groper:
Not a goer W.C.H.: Better send it to the lady
by post, or, quicker still, by bullock-dray....
E.M.D. (London): Not what we want A.C.G.:
Well, off you go:—
The elections are all over and we still have Billy
To represent Australia, you see we had to choose,
And I hope that in the future we shall all get bet.er
news
That something’s done.
Bracey: No; too crude.... Les E. H.: (1) Write
to him at the Sydney Sun office; (2) daresay N.L.
has heard it. Everybody else has ; but in case he is
the solitary man who hasn’t enjoyed it we’ll send it
to him Riv: That inquiry about the pine-tree is
too general Lilli Ivipilli: Because this paper likes
to promote a thirst for Christian knowledge, come in
here: —
1 take the daily papers
And search the news they bring,
But all thev have to write about
Is Dr. Truby King.
It gets a little tiresome
To hear his praises ring ;
Will sopieone kindly tell me
Who the is Truby King ?
A q . “King Dick” makes painful reading. Not
much humor in plain corpse even if it is black. .. •
ET. (St. K.) : Doesn’t carry itself Wangi: Held
for inquest.... Marjory O.: Fairly good work for a
girl of II M.A.P.: No use to us Austral:
Not nearly up. . . .W.M.8.: Doesn’t move us •
H.G.L.: Long covering letters are waste of time.
No good telling us what pals you are with the
bush. Let your work try your knowledge. ...
A N G ■ Always accompany your copy with a cheap
insult if possible. That helps to cover all your
failures... .Bally: Yarn far too obvious... .A.R.N.:
Send stamps with copy if you want it returned....
M.M.: Don’t care for Queen Hiawatha.... E.8.T.:
Sorry, must go back.... Darby: “Billpan ’ has an
idea,' but the work is too crude Lawc-lark: The
story is poor and the verse that carries it full of
kinks Oglamite: The characters are there, but
the yarn is thin. Feed it up a bit. .. . H.H.H.:
The drunk goat is poor business Kay K.: Re-
marks about “scurulouse” journalism need brighten-
ing L.M.8.: Verse far from good enough....
Fonoble: No. ... J.A.F.: To be quite frank, “Digger’s
Lament” is very bad. . . .F.D.A.C.D.L.1.: Don’t care
for any of them. .. .F.E.8.: Melodrama isn’t any
more convincing because the actors are
A 1 B.: It is very hard to get the sense of “Quest.
Raphilomel: Very joyous fragment, but a little
wordy J.L.1.: Don’t like “Kangura” 5.0.8 :
None of them" quite do it. . . .II.ILB.: Hideous thing.
H.C.M.: Poor stuff En Avant: The essay on
“Napoleon as a statesman” rearhed us about 105
years too late. Suppose it’s Webster’s fault.
L.C.M.: Curious thing how the rhyme “strife-life
fixes the measure of a versifier’s skill. You use it in
both attempts and they fall naturally into the
twenty-ninth grade.... The Dreamer: What’s this.
“She also noticed that her one and only (whom
she had not at all that night) was with them.” But
did she observe that her take it Slowly (which
perhaps she would not together, anyhow) was rather
tired of besides after whatever the other people?....
W..T.C.: A bit wooden for the jazzing theme. 1 011
can improve it Herbert J.: All right, sail in
and say your “Good Wishes”: —
At the beginning of the happy new year,
Let us be verv careful to appear,
As if it was very good, for us to be here,
And have all the things we want near.
Being the year nineteen hundred and twenty,
It is very certain we shall have plenty ;
When the rain falls to make the flowers sentty
In the year “1920.”
It is beautiful to be sure that everything is nice
So it is a very good thing to say it twice
(It is beautiful to be sure that is nice)
Except the “price” of potatoes and “rice that is
not “nice.”
So while the State of New South Wales is selling
I am sure that what we eat the sea will not miss,
We can have a new year’s wish,
Everybody be like Saul, son of Kish (king).
....Pin Point: Yes, not a bad gag. But this paper
is quite satisfied to be more like a paper than am-
"thing else Prickly P.: Mutiply the space between
your lines by 10 and give your stuff a chance.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
.T.N.: A little Indian ink and a lot more know-
ledge Edith W.: The wise Christmas artist arrives
about June. But you haven’t qualified yet....
KW C • Too stiff. Keep on trying and look for
brighter jests....G.N.: Go ahead, 14! You’ve got
plenty of time to study.. . .F.C.C. : A glimmering
wire-netting effect. Try for a firmer line....
R.H.McG.: The figures lack expression. Appreciate
>. ur neatness 1U.8.: It doesn’t sparkle i IX:
The wicked gent, with the monocle doesn’t seem .to
belong. Is he of French origin ? Military drawing
isn’t anywhere near the gallery-joke standard....
E.J.M.: All sad as a wet Sunday K.U.F.: A bit
on the rough side 8.M.5.D.: No, thanks R.C.:
The man on the couch looks troubled. No doubt
it is about the tangled state of his legs.... C.L.T.:
We’ll struggle along without those suggestions....
U L : All your people are straight out of the
timber-yard J.W.S.: Classical idea several years
late .■ • Spot: They look English tramps. But battle
away A.W.0.H.: You may call for the poultrv.
r.C. ; They were not favorably received!
Sio's: Don’t offer us the green apples of Art....

more.

Make Your Backache
Quickly Disappear.
Mrs. E. MARSHALL (from a photo by
Monte: Luke).
I am pleased to write you about
Dr. Sheldon’s Gin Pills. Having
suffered from Backache and Kid-
ney Trouble, it had me that I
didn’t care if I lived. I tried all
kinds of remedies. Seeing your
advertisement in the paper, I was
induced to try your pills, and, to
my delight, the first bottle did me
good. I continued with the Gin
Pills, taking half a dozen bottles,
which cured me.
I always keep a large bottle in
the house, and can recommend
them to anyone suffering as I did.
You may use this as y >u wish.
Yours gratefully,
(Sgd.)
Mrs. EDWARD MARSHALL,
“Ilford,”
Australia Street,
Woollahra.
Gin Pills Will Help You.

The Jealous Gods.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
WHEN you and I laugh out together
for no cause but love,
The flowing air forgets to flow the
green earth above,
And all the swinging universe slackens and
stands still.
When we laugh out .for nought but love,
Heaven waits our will.
Yet, through my laughter running, go the
quick feet of fear!
Sometimes between our kisses do you not
also hear
A sound that jars the rapture and sets it all
awry?
The swirl of mighty garments as if a god
strode by?
As we, not born immortal, go dow r n the
Elysian path
I am afraid! I am afraid of the jealous
gods’ wrath
That I without her loveliness should tread
where Psyche trod,
That you exult whose veins hold not the
ichor of a god !
I am afraid ! I am afraid lest the joy of my
heart’s song
Should wake the gods to envy and make
them work you wrong!
Sometimes, w'hen we laugh out for love, fear
makes me sad,
Because not Jove could make a woman more
divinely glad !

A Problem in Morals.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
SAMUEL GOLDSTORM, financier,
broker, outrageous usurer, sat in his
big office chair, smoking a smuggled
cigar which had a finer aroma because it
hadn’t paid duty.
Now, Mr. Goldstorm was not often back at
his office after hours unless there was some-
thing special to be done in the way of busi-
ness. After a day in the city the Goldstorm
type not infrequently follow pleasure. On
this evening very special business had called
him back to his chambers. A client, hard-
squeezed, had arranged to pay him £5OO in
gold, to save himself from worse things.
The client had gone. On the table in
front of Goldstorm the sovereigns were piled
in little columns —rich yellow shafts very
lovely to look upon. The door of the safe
was open for the treasure, but, in the act
of interning it, the fascination of the sov-
ereigns caught him, so he lit a cigar, lay
back in his chair and let his glances play
with the gold. Although a wealthy man. he
did not see this number of sovereigns very
often. This fact struck his imagination.
Large sums were paid away by him every
week, and, of course, larger sums were
received. But hard cash rarely passed. In
this case Sam Goldstorm had substantial rea-
sons for not taking a cheque.
The little shafts of gold magnetised him,
so that he was forced to admit that this
supreme metal has a fascination which no
cheque for the same amount could equal.
In this reverie half an hour passed.
. The clock struck nine, and just when the
last stroke tolled from the Post Office tower
Goldstorm felt a vague compulsion to look
behind him. There was no noise, nothing
more than the subtle impression of another
presence—the spell of fixed eyes on the back
of his head. He turned reluctantly and
looked straight into a revolver barrel. The
burglar’s face was covered by a half-mask,
beneath which there was a straight, un-
sentimental mouth and the squarest chin
Goldstorm had ever seen. Two flashing eyes
shot sinister glances through the eyeholes.
Goldstorm flinched at this unexpected fac-
tor in the position. The exuberant color
fled swiftly from his fleshy face, leaving it
a dark yellow. His quick mind realised his
helplessness at once, for every office in the
chambers was empty. The caretaker was
in the basement, or, for all he knew, in
another world. He was trapped, with his
gold in full view and his safe open. The
open safe was the worst, for it contained
thousands of pounds’ worth of jewellery,
deposited by clients, willing to give security
and pay heavy interest for immediate accom-
modation, these being mostly silly women
hiding entanglements.
The burglar apparently realised his
unique fortune, and, as the terrified finan-
cier looked at him, his straight lips pai’ted
in a smile. How long he had been there,
pointing his deadly tube, Goldstorm did not
know; but at present tfie burglar seemed in
no hurry. He stood quite still, sternly men-
acing his victim. In the stillness Gold-
storm could hear his watch ticking in his
pocket. Several minutes passed in a sus-
pense intolerable to the financier, nervously
expectant of the bullet which he had no
doubt was to end all. In a vivid vision
the murder of a Melbourne diamond mer-
chant under similar circumstances was re-
called to him. It struck him that this might
be the very murderer.
Presently the pointed pistol reduced him
to a state of collapse. The burglar’s silence
was uncanny. Pistol and silence together
mesmerised him. Goldstorm was like so
much pulp.
Then it occurred to him that if he could
only save his life the burglar would be wel-
come to the treasure. He tried to speak,
and at last succeeded in jerking from his
dry mouth the words: “Take it all.”
The burglar advanced to the table and
spoke at last.
“Do you give me all this. Mr. Goldstorm?
It’s very kind of you. Rather unusual, too.
I don’t remember that you are remarkable for
charity. Case of the right hand not know-
ing what the left hand does, I suppose?”
As he spoke the burglar pocketed the gold.
“On this occasion you have nobly re-
deemed your reputation. It is really a free
Sift, Mr. Goldstorm?” he inquired with sar-
donic insistence.
“Yes, take it,” repeated Goldstorm, st’ll
hypnotised by the little tube which pointed
at him all the time like the relentless finger
of doom.
‘‘Don’t be frightened,” the robber said
softly. “I’m not going to hurt my benefactor.
But you will have to stop here till morning,
I am afraid.”
He bound the collapsed financier and
gagged him.
Goldstorm saw him ransack the safe, tak-
ing the jewellery, but restoring cheques and
paper securities. This task accomplished
the robber looked once more at the strapped
and muzzled Goldstorm, contemplating him
with a smile. The situation obviously
amused him. Here was a position in which
Goldstorm’s wealth and astuteness availed
him nothing. Law, society, the security
guaranteed by community, had been broken
by the violence of a single outlaw daring
enough to take chances. The morality of
the matter was simple. The legal robber
had been robbed by the illegal robber.
The burglar, moving on felted feet, opened
the door and went out. A few minutes after-
wards the financier’s fugitive color returned.
Life, once more unthreatened and safe, red-
dened in his cheeks.
The burglar went on his way with a special
sense of elation, for this job had been much to
his satisfaction, and the proceeds relieved him
of the need of exertion for a long time. The
hard cash was specially acceptable, for it
provided the means for a trip to London,
long contemplated, and there the jewellery
could be disposed of at something like its
fair value.
Walking towards tin l suburb in which his
quiet lodgings were situated lie passed a
house all in darkness. The front door stood
open, and, obeying a professional instinct, he
slipped in, closing the door behind him.
Instantaneously he felt that he had made
a mistake. Ordinarily his entry would have
been the right thing. Circumstances being
normal, an open door is a burglar’s luck, but,
loaded as he was with treasure, another risk
was dangerous and foolish. Compared with
the proceeds of the Goldstorm exploit, the
contents of any private house were quite un-
likely to justify the inevitable risk he ran.
For a little space he was tempted to with-
draw without exploring the house, but, after
a short struggle, he decided to follow his
luck. In the dark hall he drew on his felt
overshoes that had served him faithfully
earlier in the night.
Upstairs in that house Jack Julian was sit-
ting in the dark, brooding amid the ruins of
his cosmos—financial ruin only, it is true,
but black and scientifically complete. Two
years ago Julian brought his newly-married
wife to this house, and for half that time
supreme happiness had filled it with the
chime of golden bells. But other things wei'e
maturing. The head of the big house for
which Julian sub-managed had been held up
for years as the model of commercial ability.
Events proved to his enraged directors that
he was a maker of gross miscalculations and
ruinous contracts. »Jack Julian, being in no
way responsible for this, illogically lost his
billet. Like Browning’s man “he was ever
a fighter.” Only a few years ago he held the
heavy-weight amateur championship, so he
went confidently into the ring against bad
luck. His defeat was in detail, but decisive,
and on that day his wife had gone to a
friend in the country with the baby. On the
morrow the furniture was to be auctioned.
Meanwhile Julian was sitting in his bedroom,
chin on hand, darkly musing.
It was into this house that the luck of
the burglar led him with singular inappropri-
ateness.
Julian did not hear the door close, nor any
steps in the hall; but presently he heard the
sound of pressure on the stairs, slight but
unmistakable.
A housebreaker ! He smiled grimly. Mov-
ing noiselessly, Julian hid himself behind the
door. Presently the vivid rays from an elec-
tric torch swept around the room. Having
satisfied himself that it was empty, the
burglar stepped in and immediately found
himself on the floor, his revolver held m a
muscular grip, his throat in another. He
loosed his revolver, which Julian seized.
Then, releasing the already half-strangled
burglar, Julian switched on the light.
“Get up,” he said.
The burglar struggled to his feet. His
mask had fallen off and his face, although
flushed, was by no means a bad one. It was
the face of a man of thirty or thereabouts,
alert and determined, with an exceptionally
relentless mouth. Being an intelligent cal-
culator of chances he knew that Julian was
undoubtedly his master, and stood quietly
awaiting events, outwardly calm and in-
wardly raging at the cursed stupidity which
had led him into this trap.
Julian regarded him savagely enough at
first, but presently a sense of the elaborate
mu ny of the P° sition took possession of him.
There was surely abundant humor in this
attempt to rob him in his present circum-
■stances. The burglar, a careful reader of
the human face, - watched him closely, and
Ins spirits improved as he noticed the ‘soften-
ing. Julian spoke first.
“You came here for loot, I suppose? Bur-
glars generally do.”
Ihe burglar said nothing. No answer
seemed necessary.
W ell, I should much like to know if you
have discovered any, for I think I want it
more than you do.”
A glitter of satisfaction flashed in the
burglar’s watchful eyes. Still he remained
silent, careful not to interrupt a mood which
undoubtedly was not unfavorable. Julian
critically surveyed, the well-dressed figure.
“You seem in rather affluent circum-
stances, Julian said. “I wonder you thought
it good enough to crack a little place like
this. A bank would be more in your line
wouldn’t it?”
A smile wavered on the straight lips of
the prisoner.
“Is this a paying game?” Julian asked.
In response to this direct question the
burglar replied coolly, “I find it so, on the
whole.”
Perhaps you do, but it has its risks.
How many times have you been in gaol?”
“I have never been in gaol.”
“What,” said Julian— “this is not your
first night out, surely?” •
“I hrve been at this sort of thing for five
years.
“Then this will be your first sentence, and
all for nothing. Hard luck.”
The burglar’s eyelashes flickered nervously.

CURES:
ECZEMA- —“I had an outbreak of Eczema j
on my head. The irritation was dreadful,
writes Mrs. J. Martin, of 118 Wilson-street, |
ltedfern, Sydney. Proceeding, she says.
“The Eczema continued bad for four years,
and no matter what I tried I could not
cure it. At length, seeing Zam-Buk Balm
and Zam-Buk Soap advertised, I decided to
give them a trial.
“1 shampooed my head thoroughly with
Zam-Buk Soap, dried it, and then applied the
Zam-Buk Balm. I persisted in this treat-
ment for some-dime, and finally got rid oi
the trouble altogether.
INJURED KNEE.—Mrs. Lottie Howarth,
Franeis-street, Rockhampton (Q-)> wiii.es.
“My hushand fell and dislocated his knee. It
was in a very bruised condition, all the
flesh being black and blue. Zam-Buk was
• applied, and quickly reduced the swelling,
drew out all the congested matter, and healed
the bruised flesh. The dislocation having been
adjusted, Zam-Buk was well rubbed in. Inis
treatment kept the joint pliable, and it
gradually became stronger, allowing him to
resume his duties.”
RVTINS-—Mr. Thomas Crawford, 109 Hutt-
street, Adelaide, says:—
“I was severely burned while testing
a motor-car. One of my fellow-workmen
advised me to apply Zam-Buk without,
delay. I followed his advice, and after
applying the Balm I experienced the greatest
relief. I continued the Zam-Buk treatment
with such satisfactory results that in the
course of.a few days I was able to resume
my work again, for the pain had been ban-
ished, the inflammation taken away, and the
burns quite healed.”
Zam-Buk is unequalled for cuts,

“I wish you hadn’t come here,”, Julian
proceeded. “I had rather you had been
caught by a policeman in a bank. When
your devilish bad luck brought you here it
led you to the house of the stoniest-broke
man in this city. All I’ve got to call my
own is just you, and unless there’s a reward
I don’t see any way of making anything out
of you. Is there a reward for you, by any
chance ?”
The burglar shook his head.
“Not at present, but later on there may
be,” he replied.
“I am afraid I can’t keep you on spec.,
so if you will just turn right about we’ll take
a walk down to the police station. It’s not
far.”
. “One moment,” said the burglar, calmly.
“I have never yet seen the inside of a gaol.”
“You’ll see it now,” said Julian. “You’ll
walk first, and I’ll be two yards behind with
this.” He waved the revolver.
“Before we go,” said the burglar, “let’s
see if we can't find a more satisfactory
proposition. See.” He took from his pockets
roll after roll of sovereigns—Goldstorm’s
sovereigns.
Julian’s eyes opened at the sight.
“There are five hundred of these,” the
burglar explained. “They are yours if you
will close your eyes for a few minutes.”
Julian shook his head. 'Nevertheless the
burglar smiled.
Julian was gazing as though fascinated by
the money. The burglar judiciously let the
gold make its appeal to him in silence, just
as he had used his silent revolver to de-
moralise Goldstorm an hour previously. He
was relying on the psychological method. At
last Julian sighed, as a man does who comes
out of a trance. It was absolutely the most
powerful temptation of his life, for that gold
would save him.
“I can’t,” he gurgled. “It's stolen.”
“You’re wrong,” the burglar said promptly
“That money was given to me.”
“Given !”
“Yes,” the burglar said easily. “The
money was actually presented to me. Yon
may consequently take it without a scruple.”
“And the condition is”
“That you go to sleep for just two
minutes.”
Julian reflected deeply. He was torn by
temptation. It would assuredly not be the
act of a good citizen to let the burglar go,
but good citizens had never yet demon-
strated the most casual interest in his per-
sonal welfare. In any case he was not a
thief-taker. Moreover the gold was priceless.
The conviction of this man would bring him
no glittering recompense or sweet satisfac-
tion. Why should lie adjust the responsi-
bility of the man’s wrong-doing? Heredity,
environment or circumstance, which had
made him the criminal that lie was —these
were the responsible irresponsibilities. Be-
sides—the greedy thought would not be
banished —the gold was priceless.
The burglar intuitively followed Julian’s
mental struggle with keen anxiety.
Suddenly Julian yawned.
“I feel sleepy,” he said.
Hope rushed into the burglar’s heart.
‘‘But,” Julian said, dropping into a chair,
“I always sleep with one eye open.”
lie heard no sound, but when he looked up
he was alone.
The question is: Was he justified?

Guilty Conscience.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
f try HE little man reached tentatively into
I his pocket, produced a pack of cards,
and gazed inquiringly around the
carriage. His fellow-travellers became in-
tensely interested in the pill signs dotting
the flying topography. With a sigh the little
man replaced his stock-in-trade, patted his
aggressive purple tie, and meandered mourn-
fully down the swaying corridor in search
of pastures new.
In the end compartment two men smoked
stoically against the time when the dilatory
engine should bring them to the next re-
freshment station. The little man sidled in
with an affable nod to the nearest man.
From his glowing vest he produced a dila-
pidated cigar-case, and therefrom a still more
dilapidated cigar, which ha was in the act
of caressing with a moist red tongue when
his eyes were arrested by those of the man
in the opposite corner. The little man knew
that stare, as he knew the man behind it.
It was a rude stare, and beneath it the little
man sat frozen to his seat, tongue still
caressing the seedy cigar after the manner
of a child with a lolly-stick. /Eons of time
he sat there before a resurgence of arrested
faculty enabled him to collect his wits and
gain the corridor. Out of range of those
aggressive eyes he did the journey to the
other end of the carriage in three seconds.
In the little alcove amid the conductor’s
miscellany of brooms and towels he fetched
up and mopped his beaded brow with a crim-
son silk handkerchief.
“Heavens!” he muttered, replacing his
dingy felt hat. “What’s he doin’ here?
Blime, I gotter git outer this.”
In the carriage he had just vacated Mr.
Frederick Brogan, of the Criminal Investi-
gation Branch, grinned at his fellow-travel-
ler’s look of amazement. “Guilty con-
science,” Mr Brogan said, and relapsed into
coma.
A cautious glance along the corridor
afforded the little man the consolation that
Mr. Brogan had no immediate interest in
his movements, whereat he sighed with deep
relief. To get into the lion’s jaw, as it
were, and to get out again without trouble,
was something; but he could not dispel the
thought of the lion la*ter on coming along
and partaking of the meal which could not
get away from him. At the moment a cer-
tain escapade from whose consequences he
was now escaping was vivid before the little
man. He must get out of the train some-
how*. . . , I .^ l
For all his air of mild passivity the little
man did not lack nerve. Business is busi-
ness, and the necessity of acquiring a work-
ing capital to offset the period of compul-
sory rustication amid the pie-melons and
wallabies caused the little man finally to
push Mr. Brogan into a back place in his
mind.
Luck had it that he should happen upon
a cabin where three bored commercial tra-
vellers played poker on a suit-case. As
a rule the little man fought shy of com-
mercials, but he stretched a point and sat
down to watch the game. The players sized
him up as a country storekeeper returning
from a mild jag in the metropolis. lhe
little man had thought they would ; it was
a good asset, that appearance of his. Later
on, when asked to make a fourth, lie con-
sented with fluttering eagerness. He had
expected that to happen too. The game
lasted half an hour.
“Well, tinny,” said one of the commercials,
watching the little man carefully stow his
booty about lvis person, and wondering how
much of his losses the firm would stand as
expenses, “the drinks are on you.”
“Why, certainly, certainly,” fluttered the
little man. “Pleased, I’m sure. I”
Detective Brogan, passing the doorway,
menaced him with an eye. The little man de-
camped hurriedly. It was growing dark, and
he concealed himself temporarily behind a
group ejected from a cabin during the pro-
cess of making down beds. A cold perspira-
tion bedewed him. Brogan was after him
all right, and his chance of slipping away
at the next station seemed very remote now.
His mind filled with visions of Long Bay
Penitentiary—not the somewhat comfortable
cells he knew there; but of the. long white
wall which the inmates were building under
the sponsorship of many blue-uniformed men.
The little man had already built a stretch
of that wall, and had not liked the experi-
ence Such manual labor was abhorrent to
him, and, besides, it played such how-de-do
with his well-kept hands, making a deal from
the bottom of the pack a proceeding fraught
with grave personal risk.
The vision of Brogan again in the corri-
dor, glancing with careless intentness into
the cabins as he passed, drove the litle man
precipitately to the sanctuary of the lava-
tory, where, behind the bolted door, he
whistled in a high key, and splashed vigor-
ously in the wash-basin to convey to the
peripatetic Brogan the impression of a
care-free ablutionist engaged in his pre-
bedtime rites. They must have caught
Skinny, or Junker, or both, and his part in
the affair had been confided to the police
by his confederates in the hope of better
treatment for themselves. But why hadn t
the police along the line been
Why had they put Brogan on the train .' 1
Perhaps the detective thought he had pals
with him and was biding his time in hopes
of catching the lot. Perhaps lhe
situation was beyond the little man, and in
the region of his solar plexus a dull weight
pressed in upon his soul and grew 11.01 e
heavy with each imagining of his excited
mind. lie must get out of it somehow,
must jump off the train when next she
slowed down —if he could keep out of the
way of the omnipresent Brogan in the
meantime.
Someone thumped on the bolted door, and
the little man’s heart stood still till an
unknown voice inquired profanely if he were
having a bath. Cautiously he scouted down
the train, collected his bag, and found sanc-
tuary on the rearmost platform of the de-
serted parlor car. There he lay shivering
for untold hours till, with a thrill, he felt
the brakes grind beneath him. Gripping
his bag, he climbed down to the step and
dangled one leg over freedom. The slow-
ing rattle of the train changed to a hollow
roar, and the trestles of a bridge vibrated
beneath. The little man smothered a curse
as he withdrew his dangling leg, and from
his precarious perch tried to discern the
solid bank through blackness of the density
of velvet. The crawling train, yet a little
short of solid earth, was gathering headway
again.
The little man turned to regain the plat-
form, and butted his head against the knees
of someone standing on the dark platform.
With a yell lie threw himself backwards and
outwards, and alighted on his feet. His
legs carried him a few bounding steps of
their own volition ere he somersaulted un-
hurt into the grass at the track-side. Stiffly
he climbed erect and blundered along in the
darkness, lie must hurry, hurry! Brogan
would stop the train and come back to look
for him, and he must get away. Brogan
might even jump off the train, too. At
that moment he sprawled headlong over some
obstacle in his path, and became immedi-
ately involved in a whirlwind of punching
arm's and thrusting legs. Someone rolled
him over, sat scientifically on his chest, and
with heavy fists proceeded methodically to
pound him into unconsciousness. Presently
the p amding ceased. 11 is adversary re-
lieved him of his gorgeous neckwear by the
simple process of wrenching at it till the
slip-knot came apart, and proceeded to bind
his wrists securely.
Hope left the little man, but he struggled
manfully. “Demme alone, Brogan,” he
squeaked. “I dunno nothin’ about it. It
was Skinny and Junker done it. Skinny
got the dough, an’ wouldn’t divide till”
He stopped with the realisation that he
was giving himself away. The knot-tying
had ceased, and he knew that his captor was
peering closely at him, face close to face in
the darkness. Then with startling sudden-
ness the weight was removed from his chest,
and a fresh combat commenced in the grass
beside him, waned, and gave place once more
to silence.
Then the voice of Brogan penetrated his
dazed consciousness. “Thanks for the tip
about Skinnv and Junker, old man.’ the
voice was saying. “I just got here in time to
hear you confide it to my friend here.” A
flashlight cut the darkness and shone on the
person of the little man’s late adversary,
discomfited and handcuffed. “You see.”
Brogan continued, “I had the office that this
bird was on the train, and he’s wanted bad.
Dunno what the devil you wanted to mix in
for; but after what you said I think you’d
better come along too. Git up.”
“ ’Struth!” said the little man plaintively.

have a clear head and a brain free from dullness
and fatigue. Headache, Las-
situde or Indigestion mus
not come to distract your
mind. Avoid Head-
aches, Dizziness, In-
digestion, Bilious-
ness and that “tired
feeling ” by taking
Carter’s Little
Liver Pills, the
Great Liver Invig-
orator. Thousands
have attained success by their timely help.
Just try one after meal*. Safe for children.

REFRIGERATING AND
ICE-MAKING MACHINERY.
While the Greatest Selling factor ifi our machines is probably
their ECONOMY IN RUNNlNG—which is pertinent to the times
—their DEPENDABILITY counts a great deal for their
popularity. Even under the most severe conditions they can be
relied upon to give “CONSISTENT SERVICE.’’ Their strong
construction, and the great care taken in their manufacture is
the reason for this. Machines installed 25 years ago are still
at work to-day, giving the same service as when first installed.
We study your requirements and design the layout of your
plant, not only to accomplish a given result, but to do so with
an initial expenditure and maintenance cost. Our extensive
experience we place at your service.
