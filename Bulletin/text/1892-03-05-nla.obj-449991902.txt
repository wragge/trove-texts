If the patient’s case is of long standing, and, therefore
in need of treatment, he should lose no time in writing

complaint, and if I can effect a cure, the time it will take,
and the cost of doing so. My long experience in the
treatment of Nervous Diseases has made me thoroughly
conversant with all their peculiarities. I am prepared,
therefore, to
iuaraniei a Permanent and Complete Cure in every case I undertake,
I invite the fullest investigation into my qualifications. For some time I was House Surgeon to the Great
Northern Hospital, London, where I had special opportunities of investigating the causes of Nervous Diseases, and

DR, KELLY’S REPUTATION IS SO THOROUGHLY ESTABLISHED THAT IT WILL
ONLY BE NECESSARY FOR HIM TO INTIMATE THAT HE IS PRACTISING AS A
SPECIALIST TO BE APPRECIATED AS A BENEFACTOR TO SUFFERING MANKIND. AS
THE GREATER PORTION OP THE NEW SOUTH WALES PUBLIC IS AWARE, DR. KELLY
IS A LEGALLY QUALIFIED AND REGISTERED PHYSICIAN, AND HAS BY PAR THE
LARGEST PRACTICE IN THE COLONIES. MANY PERSONS AT A DISTANCE, HOWEVER,
ARB UNAWARE OP HIS GREAT SUCCESS, AS, HITHERTO, HE HAS REFRAINED FROM
ADVERTISING. HENCE, TO WIDEN THE SPHERE OP HIS USEFULNESS, HE HAS
DETERMINED, BY MEANS OP ADVERTISING, TO MAKE HIMSELF KNOWN IN REMOTE
DISTRICTS WHERE HIS REPUTATION MAY NOT YET HAVE TRAVELLED. AS THE
QUESTION MAY ARISE, WHY DOES SO EMINENT A PHYSICIAN AS DR. KELLY FIND
IT NECESSARY TO ADVERTISE, HE MAY REPLY TO ONE AND ALL AS FOLLOWS
IP THERE IS A PERSON ON EARTH TO BE PITIED IT IS HE WHO IS OBLIGED
TO ASSOCIATE WITH HIS FELLOW BEINGS WHILE HIS MIND IS CONSTANTLY
HARASSED AND TORTURED BY THE CONSCIOUSNESS OP
WHAT MUST INEVITABLY FOLLOW.
HE LOOKS HAGGARD AND SHEEPISH. HE IS NERVOUS IN PUBLIC. AND EXTREMELY
GIRLISH AND BACKWARD IN LADIES’ SOCIETY. THE VICTIM OP THIS, THE MOST
DANGEROUS OP ALL VICES, IP NOT RELIEVED, SOON REACHES A STATE WHICH MUST
END IN LIFE-LONG MISERY. HE MUST ULTIMATELY SINK TO THE LOWEST STAGE
OP DEGRADATION AND SHAME. DR. KELLY MAINTAINS THAT THE PHYSICIAN WHO
HAS THE POWER TO CURE, AND REMAINS SILENT, IS GUILTY OF AN UNPARDONABLE
SIN OF OMISSION. PERSONS WHO READ HIS GREAT WORK ON THIS SUBJECT WILL
BE SHOWN THE INEVITABLE RESULT OP THE BAD HABITS, AND IN MOST
INSTANCES SUFFICIENTLY EARLY IN LIFE TO ENABLE THEM
TO SEE THEIR FOLLY
BEFORE ANY DISEASE HAS TAKEN POSSESSION OP THEM. THE BOOK WILL ALSO
SHOW THEM CLEARLY
HOW TO CURE THE DISEASE WITHOUT
THE ASSISTANCE OF PHYSICIAN OR CHEMIST.
MANY PERSONS WONDER WHY THEIR MEMORY IS NOT SO RETENTIVE, AND THEIR
GENERAL INTELLECT NOT SO CLEAR AND STRONG AS THEY FORMERLY WERE.
DR. KELLY’S BOOK WILL EXPLAIN THE CAUSE IN PLAIN AND SIMPLE LANGUAGE.
THEREFORE, EVEN THOUGH YOU BE FREE PROM DISEASE, SEND FOR THIS GREAT
MEDICAL WORK, THAT YOU MAY BE ENABLED TO ADVISE OTHERS AFTER PERUSING
ITS PAGES. VERY FREQUENTLY THIS MAY BE DONE BEFORE ANY GREAT HARM

IOU.
To him who waits everything comes at last,
and after long waiting the end of the
great borrowing policy has practically come
for the provinces of Australasia. It hasarrivcd
unexpectedly and unaccountably, and to the
politicians whose one and only idea of states-
manship has, for thirty years past, been loans
and still more loans, the situation is per-
plexing. The idea which they all along
entertained was that their country could
borrow so long as its securities lasted, and
the possibility of the source 1 of supply drying
up seemed an event too remote to be seri-
ously contemplated. Yet the source has dried
up —the financial Colossus has crumbled
there is no more available loose change in
Britain, and the pawnbroking industry is as
nearly as possible hopeless. Australia’s
security is still the best in-the world—
better even than that of Britain or the
United States, which have nothing to show
for their financial burdens save old wars,
more or less disastrous—incalculably better
than that of Continental Europe, where, by
reason of the bloated armaments, every great
State has a huge and ever-growing deficiency.
.But the old loan-mongering firms and syndi-
cates through which the financial industry
was conducted have mostly come to grief,
and those that survive are weak and shaky.
Even the Bank of England was saved only
recently through French assistance, and its
present condition causes so much alarm that
the British authorities are considering
revolutionary devices for putting it on a
safer footing. Consols are kept up merely
by a system of forced currency ; all trust-
moneys are required by law to be invested
either in these, in Bank of England stock,
or in Indian Government securities, and
but for this, the bonds of the Empire
would fall with a crash into the region of
almost unmarketable paper. Britain has no
longer any money to lend, and the three-ball
business is closed up for the present through
the financial embarrassments of the great
national Hebrew, whose gilded sign has hung
out so long over the North Sea inviting all
and sundry to come and put the earth up
the spout.
* * *
No one else shows an inclination to take
over the business at this crisis. England is
by no means the richest land on earth—
both the United States and France have
probably more available gold to lend, but no
other country has ever shown any serious
desire to compete with it in the great bill-
discounting industry. England itself never
really possessed more than enough wealth
for its own internal necessities, but through
the concentration of property in the hands
of a very few, and the abject pauperisation
of the rest of the population, the rich
were ajfle to lend out at interest the money
which should have bought tables and chairs
for the poor, and to finance half the world
by dint of leaving the labourer’s roof un-
repaired and his children hungry and shoe-
less. And now the shrinkage of Britain’s
commerce, the hopeless decline of land-
values, the ruin of agriculture, and the col-
lapse one after another of many foreign
debtors have dried up her available
resources. And this complication of dis-
asters has arrived at an unfortunate season
for Australia. In Victoria and New South
Wales the earlier loans were mostly floated
for terms of twenty-five or thirty years.
They were raised with a joyous disregard of
the future, so long as the men of that day
could spend the money and stave off the
payment till the next generation. Presently
borrowing became a fixed habit, like alcohol
or opium, and the country grew to depend
so much on this artificial stimulant that the
years when no loan was floated were always
years of depression and general wretched-
ness. The necessity for more borrowed
money is hoav as great as ever, but a double-
barrelled calamity has fallen upon Australia:
the new loans are practically unobtainable,
and the old ones are falling due. The
depression which has arisen in the past
through a temporary stoppage in the influx
of borrowed money is nothing to the depres-
sion which will exist in the future, when not
only is there no influx, but a steady outflow
arises in its stead—unless, indeed, some
vigorous and statesmanlike measures are
taken to meet the emergency.
• * *
The financial trouble of the present
moment is only the beginning of the
disaster. During the remaining eight
years of the century, Victoria and New
South Wales have each to liquidate some
£5,000,000 of their ancient obligations;
after that the old debentures of the two
provinces begin to fall in like an avalanche.
Of all the next 32 years there is hardly one
in which some venerable loan does not come
due, and even if the country can, for a time
at least, float new loans to liquidate these
old ones, and still newer loans to liquidate the
new ones when they grow old in their turn,
the prospect in view is only one long, drearv
panorama of profitless finance. The most
that can be hoped for, in the woeful and
seemingly final collapse of the great pawn-
broking business, is that the influx of
borrowed money is practically at an end, but
that the country may still raise enough, by
constant worry and difficulty, to stave off
each ancient debt a little while longer when
the implacable creditor presents the bill, and
then start staving them all off over again,
and so on ad infinitum ; the least that can bo
looked for is that Victoria and New South
Wales may have to pay off these old
liabilities out of their own resources through
32 years of care and hard economy. Pro-
bably the latter would be, in the end, the
more fortunate alternative. The time must
come when national repudiation will become
so general that no country will lend a single
copper on the faith of any Government, save
possibly its own, at any rate of interest
whatsoever, and there is very little to be
gained by postponing the difficulty a few
years longer.
* » •
Neither Victoria nor New South Wales,
however, shows any inclination to face the
problem. The two provinces have simul-
taneously struck the device of raising
money on short-dated Treasury bills at
an increased rate of interest, and these
securities will fall due some two or three
years hence, at a time when the other
financial troubles are sufficiently insuper-
able. The country is trusting entirely to
Providence for a means of meeting the
liabilities already in view, and the further
debts now being incurred are left to the
same beneficent agency. When a man
under sentence of death commits another
murder he probably does it on the ground
that he cannot well be hanged twice, and
this new system of finance is based appa-
rently on the same principle. It marks a
further decadence in the principles of finance.
The Treasurers of the past were content so
long as their debts could be hung over till
the times of the next generation ; the Trea-
surer of the present is satisfied if he can
postpone his problem till a date when some
other Treasurer will probably be in office.
By-and-bye the great ambition of the politi-
cian who holds the cash will be to keep
solvent for the current month, and let the
deluge come the month after. Then the
Government will trade on overdrafts payable
on demand, and will go round at night to
discount its joint and several P.N. with a
finance company, or will put the public
lands up the spout at the Monte de
Piete, and sneak away through back
streets with the ticket. The introduc-
tion of short-dated Treasury bills would
bo a step in the right direction, if it were
accompanied by some absolutely cast-iron
provision, whereby no more loans could be
raised in the British market, either now or
hereafter. Under such conditions, it would
signify a resolve to rely for the future on
our own resources ; without any such pro-
vision it is merely a device of shreds and
patches—a miserable scheme for letting the
future take care of itself at 4| per cent,
interest.
*# » (
The intense desire to avoid new taxation
is one of the chief reasons why no Treasurer,
either in Victoria or New South Wales, has
yet ventured to face the necessities of the
situation. A democracy is hardly ever pre-
pared to tax itself, however great the emer-
gency, and in this respect the conduct of the
people of Maoriland, during the last ten years
of rigid economy, is one of the marvels of
history. The Government which holds otlice
longest is always the one which borrows
most lavishly, constructs the most public
works, useless or otherwise, takes off the
most taxes, has the largest boom, and lets
the future take care of itself with the most
complete recklessness. The sure road to
popularity is a reduction of one farthing in
the £ on the property-tax, or the removal of
some small impost on some small edible ; the
loss to the revenue, is serious and no genuine
benefit is felt by anyone, but the mere fact
that something has been taken offis sufficient.
At the present time, strange as the statement
may appear, the Australians are among the
most lightly-taxed nations in the civilised
world. The revenues of these provinces are
largely made up from land sales and railway
receipts—these latter being inserted in gross,
in order to make up a bulky and purely arti-
ficial total. The municipal rates which in
England make up almost as great a burden
as the whole charges of the Imperial revenue
are here mostly included in the general
expenditure of the State, and the total direct
charge upon each citizen is not much more
than half that of Great Britain. But this
diminution of the so-called “public burdens”
does not necessarily produce prosperity ;
quite as often it is the cause of depression.
A heavily-taxed nation, where the money is
wisely expended, is in all cases much more
prosperous than a lightly-taxed one which
makes good the deficiency by loans and
similar shady devices. The demand for a
reduction of public burdens is a mere super-
stition, but the Treasurer who will openly
assert the fact and act upon his convictions
is yet unborn. Probably, regarded simply
as a Treasurer, he might as well remain so,
for the nation would reject him promptly
and with derision.
* * *
Yet the only way out of the present diffi-
culty is by taxation—or else repudiation.
The device of staving off the responsibility is
played out. If the present revenue is in-
sufficient—as it would seem to be—then a
new impost should be imposed—a land tax,
with a specially heavy charge upon big
estates, and a still more ponderous rate on
absentees, for preference—and the proceeds
paid into a special fund for the exclusive
purpose of meeting the national obligations
as they fall due. This fund should bo kept
entirely apart from the general revenue,
and it should be made a criminal act for
the Government to use it or any part of
ic for any purpose save that for which it
was intended. All new public works should
be built upon the “ betterment ” principle,
by levying upon those property-holders whose
estates are enhanced in value through such
works at least one-half of the profits which
they thereby receive, to cover the cost of con-
struction. If the sum thus obtained is not
sufficient for the purpose the balance should
be made good either out of general revenue,
or by the issue of redeemable notes of a
State bank, or by both devices combined.
Such a policy would probably put a sudden
and violent end to immigration and it would
be well that it should do so. It might even
cause a serious falling off in the city popula-
tion, for under this Spartan regime the great
army of land - boomers, brokers, money-
lenders, bagmen, jockeys, bookmakers,
company-promoters, rnine-salters, jerry-
builders, pawnbrokers, and the like would
be woefully thinned out; they all live on the
feverish and unhealthy prosperity that is
born of borrowed money and frantic extra-
vagance, and without it their respective
occupations would fall away. But their loss
would be a great gain to the rest of the
nation, and even a temporary decline in the
census-returns would not necessarily be a
cause for lamentation. And in any case the
problem must be met, for sooner or later-
most probably sooner—a choice will have to
be made between payment or repudiation.
Will any Treasurer have the courage to give
up the worn-out policy of letting things slide
till the morrow, and state which alternative
he proposes to accept ?
Trade-marks and Treason.
Reference was recently made by The Bulle-
tin to the prosecution of some Melbourne firms
for infringements of the law relating to trade-
marks. The reference did little more than
invite attention to a subject of cardinal moment
without exhaustively examining it. But the
matter is too important, especially to Austra-
lians, to be dismissed with a paragraph. We
therefore propose to examine it more fully,
although conscious, from the magnitude of the
question itself as well as from its intimate
connection with other questions of vital interest
to young countries, that how lengthily soever it
is treated much will still remain to be said,
• # #
The particulars are fresh in the public mind.
A Melbourne brewery company was found to be
adding to its sales and consequent profits by
the simple plan of pasting false labels on its
goods. The “lager” supposed to have seen
the light in Munich was cradled and nursed
into fermentation in Collingwood Flat. The
mistake was made at the christening, when it
was given a German name instead of a Victorian
one. It was a light, wholesome, sparkling
beer, probably as good as any brewed between
the Rhine and the Niemen ; but it certainly had
no right to the label it appropriated. Its
innocuousness and gently exhilarating qualities
no more entitled it to the name it filched than
the commonplace soldiership of honest dav
labourer John M‘Liver’s son entitled him t
the name of Colin Campbell. Still, there '°
this to be said in its behalf—it was drim/ 8
relished, and lauded by Anglo-Australians wh ’
drew unpleasant comparisons between it and
the poor stuff brewed by the Yarra. Jn
word, so far as the facts of the case have
to light, the Melbourne lager was receive 1
everywhere as a highly-creditable member 0 f
the beer family till the legitimacy of its birtl
was first doubted and then denied.
# # #
The other cases of pirated trade-marks were
in connection with hats of the pattern familiarly
known as “ plug ” or “ bell-topper.” For a lonv
time Paris has been famed for the manufacture
of these depressing adjuncts to modern civili sa .
tion. This is not the place to discuss the
characteristics of such articles of head-dress or
of the heads usually entrenched in them. It
is enough to state that from Paris and in a
lesser degree from London thousands of such
nightmares are exported yearly to gladden the
hearts and oppress the heads of loiterers on
fashionable Australian street-blocks, as well as to
be subsequently used by astute traders in con-
ferring dignity on South Sea Island monarchs
whose subjects’ allegiance shows signs of
wavering. The complaint of the Melbourne
Customs was that, in some instances brought to
their notice, the white internal leather bands
where the maker’s name could alone be seen
were imported stamped with the names of
European cities, while the hats to which such
bands were afterwards attached were manu-
factured in Collins-street., The object was
obvious—to persuade purchasers that it was
European, not Australian, articles they were buy-
ing. No question of quality or inequality was
involved. The local article might have
been superior to the foreign. The offence lay
in attaching to it a name to which it was not
entitled, just as large Sydney furniture-houses
offend against fair - dealing by representing
Chinese-made chairs to be of Caucasian work-
manship.
* * *
From a moral standpoint, the actions of the
detected Melbourne firms and of the undetected
Sydney ones, are equally indefensible and un-
worthy. No ingenuity of casuistry could make
them appear creditable. The men -who suc-
ceed in creating a demand for a commodity are
as much entitled to the trade-mark differentiat-
ing their goods from those of others as they are to
their purses; and the stranger using the brand for
the purpose of securing a market for similar
merchandise of even superior quality is at once
dishonest and mean. So well is this recognised
in some countries that but the other day a
couple of French brothers were prohibited
from using their own name on the champagne
made by them, another firm with a similar
patronymic having long previously established
a lucrative trade in the same article. In short
the right of a trader to his mark is the right of
an author to his book, a playwright to his play,
an inventor to his patent, or an artist to his
sketch. All the foregoing persons may have
their rights tampered with by unscrupulous
men. The dull British dramatist does not
scruple to filch from his livelier French confrere
the choicest situations or daintiest dialogues,
and vainly endeavours to pass them off as his
own, much as the school dunce “ cogs ” from
his class-mate’s slate, and occasionally imposes
on the teacher. But whether the victim be
tradesman, author, or artist, the offence com-
mitted against him is as dishonest as it is
scurvy.
» # •
Haying said so much regarding the meanness
of this prevalent commercial habit of endea-
vouring to reap where others have sown, it might
be as well to examine another and, perhaps,
more important phase of the same subject. This
wide-spread trading desire to “wipe the eye”
of one’s brother huckster, by appropriating his
symbols, is but a symptom of a dangerous
disease that has done and is doing the greatest
mischief to the whole Australian community.
To punish one or a hundred tradesmen for
obtaining money by false pretences, or trade-
marks dishonest!} 7 come by, will avail nothing
so long as the dangerous disease referred to is
suffered to run its course unchecked. As well
try to cure smallpox by removing some of the
pustules by the ungentle assistance of a jack-
plane. The deadly ailment to which reference
is made might not inaptly be termed Anglo, or
Franco, or Europo-mania, and manifests itself
chiefly in a stolid belief that nothing good can
come out of Australia. But for this irritatingly-
stupid creed, the Customs authorities in all the
Australian capitals might rest assured that the
person who brewed sparkling beer, or manu-
factured presentable hats, would have but little
temptation to introduce either under an assumed
name. The greenness of distant fields has
become a proverb in all languages, and, as we
shall proceed to show, it is precisely at this
point —at the carefully-nurtured scepticism
regarding Australia’s present and proximate
capabilities—that the curse of being '<ut a
colony comes home to all of us.
* # •
It is this senseless desire to go far afield in
search of commodities which could be produced
at our own doors that is largely responsible for
the low standard of Australian commercial
morality. It may be said that the same trait is
to be observed in American society—that
“ dudeism ” is but Anglomania in excelsis.
Still, dudeism itself is only a form of degeneracy
and is confined to a class which in the United
States is numerically and intellectually con-
temptible. The 400 New York aristocrats—
descendants of Dutch boors and British bag-
gages —of whom so much was heard a few years
ago, possess absolutely no weight in questions
affecting politics or progress. "So long as they
confine themselves to the latest things in boots,
bangles, or breeches from Paris or London,
they are suffered to proceed unmolested and
clap their hands exultingly But they are
rudely thrust aside or insultingly ignored when
matters of State, of science ov of sociology
have to be considered. The “Anglomania”
that many newspapers on both Atlantic littorals
assure us is rampant in America turns out on
examination to be confined to a small, rich,
ignorant and insignificant class. The vast body
of the nation remains unaffected by the disease

Nothing good or grand comes from a
colony. Melba sang as sweetly, if not so
artistically, in Melbourne for £5 as in Peters-
burg for £5OO. However, she was “colonial,”
and colonists demand a foreign trademark. To
obtain an Australian bishopric it is essential to
master theology—a facetious person once called
it the “ Queen of Sciences ” by the Isis or the
Cam. The knowledge that one is three and
three one could not he property assimilated by
the Parramatta River or the Yarra. The
author or the journalist who has something to
tell must tell it “ at home ” or be ignored. Poor
Marcus Clarke discovered that years ago,
since which many have found out the same.
Our daily and weekly journals, even those
whose incomes would support many a so-called
royal house, are costive with foreign drivel
which no Sydney or Melbourne third-class
litterateur would acknowledge by appending his
proper name. Such maundering possesses the
treble advantage of being foreign, foolish, and
cheap. Our young surgeons and physicians
spend five years in obtaining a degree which
can be secured in from three and a-half to four
in Great Britain. Even then, the Scottish and
Irish M. 8., as well as the British and colonial
public, regard the “home” professional title
with confidence and the other with either
indifference or suspicion. The atomic theory,
the properties of triangles or the peculiarities
of hexameters must be taught by professors
who come from afar, never by indigenous
scientists or scholars. Even the ladies em-
ployed to superintend the highest female educa-
tion must be imported. Why young Australian
men or women should desire to secure local
degrees in arts, physic, or science is remarkable.

Hat-bands are smuggled, beer-labels counter-
feited, trade-marks impudently appropriated,
and innumerable shabby mercantile swindles per-
petrated for vulgar pelf. It will always be so till
society is placed on an entirely different basis —
on a footing which will put a full stop to the
dreariest of human epochs—the epoch of merci-
less competition. This, however, is to be said
—the accused Melbourne traders are not with-
out excuse. They are thieves, did you say ?
Perhaps so. But what is any trading nation
when it comes to that? In the pathway of these
Victorian manufacturers opportunities were
thrown enough to turn an ordinary tradesman’s
head. Why attempt to cloak the fact that,
whenever men buy and sell, falsehood is not far
off? So far as fictitious brands are concerned
their double-dealing or double-shuffling was
the direct result of their misfortune in
belonging to a colony, the section of Avhose
inhabitants that drank lager beer and wore
plug hats being bent on obtaining both articles
from abroad. Even in the East a prophet in
his own land is nothing. In Australia he is
less. Then avoid being an Australian prophet,
at least till the provinces are firmly welded, not
under the crown. What good ever came out
of a colony ?
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Applause in Church.
Piucked by recent Melbourne events, the
Sydney D.T. proceeds to discuss the question :
“Should preachers be applauded?” and con-
cludes that—
It might be to the gain of both preacher and listeners
if they were placed more completely en rapport with each
ofl'er through the medium of some expression of feeling
uy the congregations.
Just so. But if “applauded,” why not “biased?”
H a preacher should lie cheered when be utters
a popular sentiment from the pulpit, it follows
that ho may he boohoood, or “ that’s-a-lied,
when he outrages the logic or emotions of his
congregation. Any sane man caught hissing in
church at the preacher gets, under the present
Australian laws, from one to five years in gaol
for sacrilege or disturbing the service. One of
the constant taunts levelled by secularists
at the clergy is, that the latter can say
what they please from the pulpit, because
the auditor has no right to dispute with
them, or comment then and there upon their
rostrum utterances, but must remain silent,
even though his whole mind be in desperate
revolt at the privileged speaker’s outpourings.
Whereas, the secularists keep an open platform
and invite anyone who chooses to do so to stand
up and contend against the views expressed.
The clergy, ever greedy of applause but in-
tolerant of criticism, have in this matter not
even a cork leg to stand upon. The parsons are
as closely protected as the lawyers. Actors, to
whom analogical reference is stupidly made by
the Telegraph, are not. There may be a dis-
turbance caused in the auditorium of a theatre,
by discontented critics, but the penal results
are fine and damages, not gaol, a close shave,
and hard labour. No actor ever seeks to con-
strue disorder into sacrilege. On the whole,
the clergy had better endure antique custom.
If they were prepared to be unanimous and
to accept all contingencies, there arc sons
of Belial enough in Parliament to pass an act
for the purpose of gratifying their desire for the
savoury salt of applause—and the stimulating
pepper of open dissent.

Not that Henry Lucy could write, but that
the Sydney Morning Herald could publish
after its own slobber the following
Voltairean analysis of the defunct Clarence,
is a marvel:
Considering he was in his 28th year his personality was
curiously unfamiliar to the populace. Of a retiring, even
phlegmatic, disposition, he shrank from all display or
participation in public affairs, and was most happy when
left alone in the company of his mother and sisters, to
whom he was devotedly attached. He had no ambition
and very few interests. In conversation he had nothing
to say, and, although naturally courteous and really
good-natured, he never exerted himself to shine in
society, however select might be the circle. When seated
at dinner he gallantly made efforts to please the neigh-
bour on right or left, venturing on remarks about the
weather, on the sport of the day, on the function he
might have participated in, or on the temperature
of the room. But the stream of small-talk speedily
ran dry, and the Prince, having done his duty, and
shown that at least he meant well, was content to
sit staving straight before him, silent and engrossed
in profound thought, probably akin to that which
baffled his royal ancestor when suddenly confronted with
the problem of how the apple got into the dumpling. He
was not artistic in his tastes as some of the Royal Family
are, nor musical as most are, though he would sometimes
sit for half an hour and jingle simple tunes on the piano.
the university he made little progress, though the
failure was not due to lack of assiduity, lie toiled ter-
ribly at first, just as he did in opening conversation at
the'dinner-table. But finding the result equally hopeless
he gave it up. He would have made a model constitu-
tional king, and had he come to the throne would have
prolonged, certainly for the period of his life, that change
in the government of the British Empire which some
people regard as inevitable.
After this, we shall expect the Fairfaxes to
recommend the elevation to the throne of a
wax figure with a phonograph in its stomach
and eyes that roll and neck that bends when a
wire is pulled, “ t Tingle simple tunes on the
piano /”■—a king ! ! !
The Melbourne lager-beer case calls attention
to an anomaly in the Victorian honorary law-
giving regulations. “No publican,” says the
Crown Law department’s secretary, “is know-
ingly allowed to remain on the magisterial roll,
neither is any tradesman of the kind considered
eligible for the bench.” On the other hand, a
publican may be elected mayor, and as mayor
he is a “beak” for two years, after the
date of his election. Consequently a succession
of hotel-keeping mayors entails the constant
presence of two licensed victuallers upon the
bench, anyway. And as the Crown Law depart-
ment never “ knows ” when a J.P. has bought
an interest in a pub. there is nothing to prevent
the judgment seat being loaded up with liquor-
sellers, whilst that proverbial h’ass, the Law, is
smugly protesting that they can’t possibly get
there. Evidently the first thing required is a
clause annulling the claim of a mayor to magis-
tracy in the event of his holding any connection
with the grog trade. Furthermore, seeing that
the unholy bias of publicans is recognised by
the statutes, the pious bigotry of total abstainers
should also be regarded as a disqualification for
the Bench. Sauce for the alcoholic goose is
sauce for the Rechabite gander.

of Victoria are unexampled in the history of
civilised Government. A public meeting, per-
haps the most thoroughly representative and
spontaneous ever held in Melbourne Town
Hall, condemned the appointment with one
voice. A petition, proving that said appoint-
ment might be cancelled, and signed by forty-
nine out of every fifty men who were asked to
write their names, was passed in to that irre-
sponsible nonentity the Governor. At a lead-
ing theatre (the Royal) the leading character
sings every night a topical verse to the effect
that the Agent-Generalship ought not to be the
last resource of a “stone-broker.” And in
every city office, warehouse, shop, factory, or
pub., the declaration that Munro is going
away in the interests of his creditors, is
honestly made and sincerely believed. Even
presuming that rumour is unfairly rough upon
the new Agent-General, the mere fact that his
first business in London wall be the winding up
of an insolvent bank must bring himself and his
billet into disrepute. Moreover, it will tell
heavily in the money - market against the
country (or kawliny) wdiich first advertises»jthe
rotten condition of its “representative”
government, and then feebly accepts the situa-
tion as inevitable. Munro may need to escape
to Hingland by the back-door if he wishes to
avoid a huge hostile demonstration, but the
thick-skinned old Scotchman will get there all
the same.

Premier Shiels’ difficulty in obtaining Minis-
terial colleagues in the Legislative Council of
Victoria, consists solely in the malicious oppo-
sition of members of that to the demo-
cratic principle of One-man-mve-vote. Shiels
wanted Agar Wynne, but as that otherwise
tolerably useful man is an out-and-outer against
the single franchise, the negotiations fell
through. Zeal, who might have accepted a
portfolio, is at present in too delicate health.
If a similar difficulty confronted a New South
Wales Premier, the latter could simply choose
outsiders and nominate them into the obstinate
Chamber ; but the Victorian Council is an
elective one. The position shows that either
form of Legislative Council is a nuisance, a
wart on democracy, and a useless collection of
propertied and tottering knackees.

Sydney D.T. is see-sawing on the question of
the railway policy of New South Wales, the
foundation-stone of which is. that all New South
Wales railways shall be owned by tire State.
It heckles the Legislative Assembly, and
especially rages at the Labor-Party, for oppos-
ing the Simpson’s Railway Bill, and then pro-
ceeds to run its log :
But in the circumstances of financial stringency in
which the colony is at present placed, considerations of
mere policy ought not to be permitted to block the way
to all such enterprises as are not undertaken by the
Stale.
“ Mere policy !” Sniff, sniff. The D.T., never
having.had any “policy,” thinks principle
quite a minor item. The tariff is a question of
“ mere policy,” yet the D.T. writhed in caco-
phonous anguish when the tariff was amended.
“ Freedom of contract” is “ mere policy,” yet
unionist opposition to it drives the D.T. into a
straight-waistcoat and a padded cell.
It (the Simpson’s Railway) would have been worked
under an Act of Parliament securing the rights and
privileges of the people— (perhaps)— and providing also
for its purchase by the State when circumstances justified
its acquisition as a public property.
The old, old game—“ Axes to grind.” First
give special privileges and concessions to
“ private enterprise ” and enable it to establish
a local monopoly, and then buy back at a fancy
price those very privileges which were the
buyer’s own free gifts. It is like giving a man
the. free use of your stable and horseflesh for a
number of years, and then paying him a heavy
sum not to use them any more. G’long !

The bankruptcy proceedings in the case of Mr
T. Smith Richardson, the gentleman who was
the sole embodiment of the Sydney Deposit
Bank, are interesting reading. Mr. Richard-
son was accustomed to deposit “ sworn state-
ments ” of the assets and liabilities of his
institution with the Government after the
manner of legitimate banks, and these sworn
statements looked well and gave pleasure to all,
and Avere a great solace to his creditors —simply
because they were “sworn.” Then, in a rash
moment, he called in an auditor, and that per-
son pointed out, among many other things, that
when a property Avas valued in the books
at £10,500, it Avas, to say the least, a
rash proceeding to add on a sum of £20,042
for interest, &c., and call the A T aluc of the
land—which, in all probability, Avas falling
rather than rising—£31,000, for no visible
reason save that Mr. Richardson felt that
Avay. Apparently Avhenever the “bank’’was
in a tight place, the “banker” simply added
on another five or ten thousand to this un-
fortunate estate, or to any other estate, or to
all of them combined, and by this process his
institution could always be made to appear
solvent in the “sworn statement,” though it
might owe £lOO,OOO and possess no assets save
the land adhering to Mr. Richardson’s boots.
The auditor, in short, declared that the institu-
tion Avas utterly insolvent, and that the ‘ ‘ sworn
statement ” was hopelessly bogus. Then the en-
raged Richardson got up on his ear, and sent
back a memorable essay as to the duties of
the humble auditor. He pointed out thathis busi-
ness Avas simply to answer the question: —‘ ‘ Docs
the balance in my books show that I owe
£74,185 3s. 2d. to depositors and £31,111 10s.
on bills in circulation as an average indebted-
ness for the quarter in session? and, secondly,
are the assets in my books as stated in the
Government Gazette?” Also he proceeded
to sib heavily on the auditor for pointing out
that, though the balance in the books showed all
these things, that balance was utterly bogus and
sham, and he stated that the auditor had ex-
ceeded his functions, and that the corres-
pondence between them had better cease. The
wild surprise of the Sydney Deposit Bank man,
that an auditor should venture to tell him his
books were unreliable, and his balance-sheet a
deception, and his institution an utter ruin, is
another proof that the average auditor doesn’t
mention these things, bub simply certifies tp the
accounts through a telescope in dead silence,
and goes away. How Mr. Richardson chanced
to strike a live auditor Avhen there are so many
dead ones about remains a mystery.
+.
Governor Onsloav, of Maoriland, just before
he quitted the scene of his toils and his salary,
flatly refused the demand of the Ballance
Cabinet that a batch of fifteen nominees should
be sent to the Upper House in order to make
that asylum for political dead-beats a Avorkable
institution. The people of Maoriland have
elected for years past a series of the most demo-
cratic Assemblies that ever sat in any Austra-
lasian proA T ince. The democratic movement is
no sudden burst of popular frenzy, bub the
deliberate expression of public opinion, con-
firmed over and over again by the great
majority of the nation. The Assembly has
passed a large number of urgent reforms, and
the irresponsible oligarchs of the Council have
rejected them all with the calm regularity of a
machine which throws out a bill every time a
penny is dropped in the slot. Therefore, either
the system of representative government must
vanish altogether out of sight and the 50 or 60
gouty, battered, irremoveablc money-grubbers
of the Council be allowed to constitute the
nation ; or else the Upper House must be
reformed—which it can’t be unless it passes
the measure for its oavh reformation ; or it must
be abolished—which is also impossible unless it
formally enacts its oavh abolition ; or, last of all,
it must be swamped Avith a fresh batch of demo-
cratic members. It is hopeless to expect that
the Council avi 11 reform itself, and still more
hopeless to suppose that it will abolish itself,
and as Governor Onslow has just expressed his
polite regrets that he doesn’t “ see his Avay ” to
appointing fifteen new members, and has there-
upon gathered up his coronet and his carpet-
bag and the cheque for his back-salary and lied
from the scene, the Council is left master of tho
situation. «

Mr. Maurice Hervey, Principal of Illawarra
College (N.S.W.), has been devoting himself to
the Imperial Federation question, and has just
issued a volume as to its required trade policy.
The author commences by waving the Free-
trade standard and bewailing Protection, yet
proposes in the next breath to protect British
trade by the establishment of a Britannic Com-
mercial Union confined to communities owning
allegiance to the British Crown. Thus far he
has “those silken bonds” and the colonies
mainly in his eye, but he proceeds to dogmatise
thus :
The just principle should prevail not to exclude
foreigners simply because they are foreigners, but to
admit them it they choose to enter upon terms of
reciprocity.
How does Mr. Hervey propose to carry out a
reciprocal programme on Freetrade lines? His
scheme is one simply of Protection to British
commerce against the world, with the modifica-
tion of special differential duties under “most
favoured nations ” clauses to certain countries
who “reciprocate” with equal recognitions.
Foreign-trade arguments are always either pic-’
bald, or skewbald, or motley.
A Protest.
Dear Bulletin, —In the January number of the
Review of Reviews, Mr. Stead has done me the
honour to expatiate on a dialogueof mine, entitled
“ A New Capitalist,” in the current issue of the
Contemporary Review. I cannot quarrel with
Mr. Stead’s explanation of what I mean by my
dialogue (he says I “ preach my favourite doctrine
of the necessity of cultivating intelligence, at all
costs and at all hazards, as the first tiling need-
ful ”) —I cannot quarrel with this, because, of
course, ho knows very much more about what 1
mean than I do myself. That is part of his
general vocation of infallibility. He concludes
his criticism, however, by the following quotation,
which lie gives under the heading of “ Mr. Adams
says ”: —
Labour shows us in Australia, where it is alone yet
powerful enough to have anything like a free hand —•
what it is really after—and the civilisation which it rules
will be a hell of mediocrity, pullulating into corruption
and decadence ; at best a China, at worst an easy prey for
the first incursion of a more vigorous stock. It will not
advance us one step towards the true civilisation, not to,
say, towards the resolution of the great human problem.
Already the labour men decree that none but a labour
man shall stand by them. Do you guess what that
means? It means that the masses are to “run" talent
and genius to-morrow, just as the classes “ run " them
to-day, for the profit and pleasure of the “ runners ; ’’ and
once more the weary, heart-sick web shall be spun by the
stupid spider, and Nature shall sit, savage and saidonic,
enthroned on our bones, and drinking our blood from her
cups of gold, while Time, in the grey depths of space,
waits in his lethargic stupor till she, too, falls prone in an
everlasting oblivion.
When I point out that the above remarks, given
unconditionally as mine, are made by a capitalise
in keen and antagonistic discussion with a
Socialist, I fancy I am giving a sample of as
unfair a piece of alleged personal “criticism ” as
anyone could desire. The ascription of these
remarks to me, torn from all context and without
a word of explanation, seems to me to be simply a
bad case of sheer misrepresentation. I have in
Australia a few friends to whom the belief that I
had deliberately written in this way would give
pain. Others there are to whom such a shocking
right-about-face on my utterances of years would
be a stumbling-block and cause of offence. I
value all of these too highly to allow this gross
misrepresentation of me to come among them
without a strong protest. Thanking you in
advance for your kindness in allowing it to be
made in your columns, 1 am, truly yours, Francis
Adams. London, Jan. 15, 1892.

846 Maequarie-street North, Sydney, March 2, 1892,
My Dear Moorabinua, —
“ Rigoletto,” at Sydney Royal, was a “musical feast”
—Cuttica as Hilda singing like syrup, though she only
got one little knot of verdure for “ caro nome.” There
are many wicked dukes in the opera, and they are vested
(like Dante’s Beatrice) in colours of living flame; were
it not for them (and the Jester’s dress of amber
and scarlet satin) the stage would lack colour as
much as a Quaker’s seance. Because when the prima
donna is booked for persecution she never wears bright
tints, not even in her joyous youth—the shadow of the
fourth act darkles o’er her wardrobe all along, and her
clothes are as neutral-tinted as those of the uppish
servant-gal who thinks fawns and drabs make a lady.
Gilda wears two garments and a pair of breeks revealing
two supports that a wadded ballet-girl would give
her ears for, by' the way. On her first entrance she wore
a Margueritish gown of cream slashed with dull green ; in
the third, white chiffon polonaise with cascades of white
lace—and then the aforementioned hosen (which is Ger-
man for them, you know) and the top boots so that the
Jester could for evermore boast that she died in ’em, I
suppose. Signor Cuttica’s wicked duke was well-tailored
—but in the first act where he perched in his chair of
state in a gas-green coat with his mouth open he looked
for all the world like a frog catching flies for his tea.
There was a large Potts Point audience on the first
night, with one or two derelict operatic artists here and
there, who have begun to crack in their show shrieks,
glaring down Cuttica’s throat with telescopes, and look-
ing as who would say “Ah ! when I gave it—but really
she manages very well.” By the way, the d.c. (society
must mash something when Italian teams come along)
has fallen as one victim to the charms of N. Maffezzoli,
who leads the music. One fatuous female near me sighed
hoarsely, and sentimentally remarked out loud that “ she
wanted to be in the stalls so as to be near him ’’—but her
“old man” was wise enough to pin her high and dry in
the circle. As the weather threatened, dressing wasn’t
smart; the feature of the circle was the young and
cockatoo-looking bride of an octogenarian with a head as
bald as an egg—who appeared in crushed strawberry
fringed round with snowy wool. The lady looked happy.
By the way, her marriage settlement ran into five
figures.
As “Faust” took its preliminary at the Royal on a wet
and windy evening, and with the seamy side of the Opera
Co. largely on view, the circle was neither clothed nor in
its right mind, so to speak, and if it hadn’t been for Carrie
Swain’s diamonds and satin, there would have been a dead
level of dressing that wouldn’t cockle if the owner got
into a puddle or a shower of rain on the home-beat. And
a “ useful stuff” is like a useful woman—notmuch to look
at as a general thing. One gold-washed lady in the front
row had a black gown and a pair of black lace sleeves that
made her arms present a bold tattoo, and another sug-
gestive spectacle was a man in a gorgeous smoking-cap
and a trail of fusohias in his coat. Poor thing I Perhaps
he was “ engaged,” and the fancy work and floral horrors
of the half-way stage to nuptial bliss had just begun to
wreck his personal appearance in the old, old way.
“ Faust,” with its swe£t, familiar music, presents many
strange sights that I always mutely wondered at. One is
the distinct economy of Siebel’s bouquet. The Siebel-up-
to-date gets his vegetables from a florist, but the operatic
youth picks a floral offering from the girl’s garden and
lays the results of her own watering-pot upon her window,
sill just as a guarantee of good faith, I suppose. It is
never any wonder to me that Marguerite took the jewels
in preference to the dahlias and things she grew herself.
And why didn’t they tailor old Faust so that he hasn’t to
grab his gaberdine with both hands? And even then the ,
blue silk legs of Faust, junior, twinkle through a crack
looking as if the metamorphosis were starting at his feet.
Guidotti’s Marguerite wore the conventional white robe
of purity with saddle-coloured slashings and her hair in
bell-ropes tied with blue in the second and third acts. In
the fourth act a mulberry gown with black about it—
wronged virtue is as peculiar about its dressing as madame
in the Divorce-Court—and in the prison-scene white re-
lieved with straws in the hair. The warmest bit of colour
in the whole yell was Lucifer’s hot-poker suit. There is a
general impression that the Devil goes his rounds like a
roaring lion; in operatic circles, he looks more like a
roaring tomato.
I am told that the deceased semi-millionaire divided up
his big fortune very fairly, and left his bride the same
share as she would have got had she been his daughter.
She might have been his grand-daughter for that matter.
Women seem to have very foggy notions of some
things, especially when they exchange confidences in a
tram. The other day two of them were discussing a
democratic M.P.—“Oh, I can’t bear him,” said one,
“ he’s a Republican.” “What really is a Republican ?’
queried No. 2. “ Oh, a horrid man who won’t wear a tall
hat and doesn’t believe in God.” And yet some of them
want to vote. lam afraid that my sex pictures the Deity
in a belltopper.
It is always cherche\ la femme. In the “ usual divorce
case,” unravelled by Judge Windeyer recently, petitioner
said that she heard respondent was a married man and
taxed him with it. He denied it, and, moreover, said that
if she could give him the name of her informant he would
prosecute her." The wife, you see, never mentioned the
sex of her gossip, but her morganatic husband dropped
on to a woman first guess. Further down in the “un-
usual case ” petitioner confessed that her “ sister-in-law ’»
conclusively proved that the respondent was already
married. Of course her brother-in-law knew it too—but
catch a man throwing bombs into a happy home that
way. Man sits down and waits for fate to run down the
other fellow, saying that it’s none of his business ; lovely
woman lugs Nemesis along by the hair of the head.
The second of Meredith’s Ballad Concerts was held in
Sydney Town Hall, the other evening, with Baber,
Lynne, and Mrs, Hugh Duff for oantatrices, and Turner,
Rainsford, Marshall, and Farley, on the side of the
dress-suits. These “pop.” concerts (the attendance was
poor) were started on the heels of the performances of
Nicholson’s troupe from Melbourne, but it must be
remembered that the other team hadn’t cheap good
Italian opera to compete with. Lynne’s “ Ora pro nobis,”
and Turner’s shrieks about the “ Sailor’s Grave,” were the
features of the evening.
A number of musical folks dropped in to hear Mons.
Wiegand play a “Fantasia in D minor” (composed by a
Sydneyite, Mr. E. Trueman) on the Centennial organ,
last week. The budding music-constructor is studying at
Leipsic—let us hope not to eventually become only one
more unpatronised brass-plate in Paling’s top garret,
which is what they all seem to level down (or up ?) to in
this soulless land. Mr. Trueman’s father is organist at
the Anglican Church, Hunter’s Hill.
A recent excitement among churchy folks in an up-the-
line Sydney suburb was when an elder or a deacon or
somebody like that had a very small boy reprimanded
before a full congregation, and made to abjectly apologise
for writing a “personality” in the elder’s hymn-book.
The moral police in some churches are like the minions
of the Law, who generally arrest the youngest offender—
if we are to put any' faith in the harlequinades of a million
'mimes.
That is an odd story about a sporting professional man
down South (since retired) whose wife went to America
with her child, whither hubby promised to follow her
sooner or later. But a lady with a fine figure on horse-
back won the Freetrade affections of this promising
grass-widower in the interim, and while his wife was
quietly waiting for him in New York he espoused
the new idea and —l2 months later impudently
and recklessly' sent a copy of his “ marriage ” certificate
and that of the birth of a fine olive-branch to the woman
who was waiting for him “ down under.” It is just
possible that his wife—though a sensitive woman who
would (ordinarily') rather die than figure in a police-court
on a maintenance hunt—will not be able to meekly stand
that insult, and, after all, there might be some nice pick-
ings for the lawyers and the evening press.
Sydney Women’s Literary Club (that is the way it ought
to be put) is supposed to fall down and worship at the
shrine of Johnsonian English, and yet a member—of the
committee, too ! —was talking at the top of her voice the
other day about somebody or something being “horrid.’’
Horrid is schoolgirl, not dictionary, English—quite as
dreadful a word as “ awfully’,” for using which any member
is liable to be stood in the corner for a week. The com-
mittee at least should talk like a book if it wants to
encourage its disciples.
Mr. and Mrs. Woodin entertained a crowd of people at
their residence, “ Cassandra,” Bondi, on 24th ult. Floor
and music were as nice as could be, and the decora-
tions of pied art silk and elf-lights were most artistic and
original. Mrs. Woodin wore a trained dress of cream
brocade, with gold bullion trimming and cream chiffon
sleeves, diamonds on the corsage and in the hair, and her
two juvenile daughters were in white silk and pink silk
respectively. Most of the lady guests wore virgin white,
and the room resembled a snow-storm sometimes in
consequence.
Sydney University commemorates on 9th April this
year, and as it will thus fall on a Saturday—mob day—
the Dons ought to hold it in the Domain, so that the
audience might have a chance to climb a tree to see what
really is going on. Governor Jersey will doubtless go in
fear and trembling. Last time a rude undergrad, actually
requested him to “ shut up !”
When a mail-steamer homeward bound hauled off from
Circular Quay the other day, a married couple in the
saloon began rushing to and fro in an excited manner
asking that the engines should be backed because their
baby and nurse-girl were left behind. The blessed infant
on the wharf was still visible to the naked eye, and as its
shrill howl wafted across the water some of the passengers
thought of asking the captain to leave it where it was in
the interests of peace and quiet. But the gallant tar
stopped the vessel in mid-stream—a tender steamed up
with the precious child on deck, and the voyage was
resumed to a chorus from all the single women on board
of “ an’ did Poppsie Woppsie fink its mumma and puppa
had left it on ze naughty wharf zen?"
Yours affectionately,

Premier Dibbs ; “ Admiralty House and

In N.S. W. Assembly last week, Mr. G. D.
Clark rose to complain that the hangman had, on
the ground that “ he was a civil servant ” (which
he is, with a salary of .£180), refused to look after
a certain flower-bed at Darlinghurst Gaol. The
Bulletin wants to know why any hangman
should be required to look after flowers ? Is there
anything appropriate in the spectacle of a noseless
executioner touching up the lily, and smelling the
heliotrope, and gently tending the bright red rose
with the same hairy hand which adjusts the noose
under the ear of the condemned ? We know an
Australian gaol-governor who possessed a garden
of which he was very proud, and in it an aloe of
which he was proudest of all. But one day the
flogger came down there to officially whale a
prisoner, and as he passed he snuffed at the aloe,
and straightway that unfortunate plant withered
up and died. If the hangman is to look after a
flower-bed, we hereby suggest, with this catas-
trophe in view, that he should do it with his head
disguised in a kerosene-tin.
It is most convenient to have a first-class
room near tram stopping places, where ladies
can rest themselves, and if they choose, have a
good cup of tea, or other refreshments. We
understand the Country Milk Co.’s “ Cascade,”
80 and 82 Elizabeth-street, near King-street, is just
the place; it is certainly the largest and best-
conducted room in Sydney, and is getting quite
the fashionable resort for afternoon tea. We also
understand that ladies who so desire can have
parcels sent there, so that they can call for them
just before taking the tram for home.*
To the inventive genius of a lady in 1843
are we indebted for the first ice-cream freezer,
but those ladies who wish to save time, labour,
and money invest in the new German Freezer.
Why ? There is no handle to turn, not half so
much ice used, and it keeps the cream firm in or
out doors. Two quarts of ice cream can be made
for Is. 6d. to Is. 9d. Send for Sydney testimonials
to. T. A. Knight & Co., St. James Chambers,
King-street, Sydney, who supply the machine.

The Rev. F. Hastings, of Adelaide, speaking at
a meeting held in that city of many churches,
last week, said that “ he would like to see a great
influx of Chinese to Australia.”
The Reverend Hastings, F.,
(Good Lord preserve us all ?)
He is a perfect Meph-
Istopneles—in small.
For, sure, it must be scorn
Of whites—or a disease—
Makes him exalt his horn
In praise of the Chinese.
He’d have them here, he would,
These Pagans clean and chaste,
lie finds them very good—
We don’t admire his taste.
And yet it may be fine—
His taste, why should we flout?
A hunger quite divine
He has, without a doubt.
For saving from the coals
Of—where the sinner fries
Forever—precious souls
That squint through slanting eyes.
His fancy seems outre
To us ; he doesn’t care
For trifles such as, say,
A leper here and there.
This pearl of clergymen
With courage to the brim
Is filled—an opium-den
No terrors has for him.
He’s with the Mongol bland
In uridisgusted touch,
He loves the coolie, and—
He coolly says as much.
Instead of Christian 100
To aid a church-bazaar,
Their heathen pak-a-pu
He would prefer by far.
’Twould be a problem rare
This taste to backward trace,
Ethnologists would swear
’Twas something in the race,
And go on to explain,
And make it clear as mud,
There’s some Mongolian strain
A-working in his blood.
One thing’s, however, clear—
And this he surely sees ?
They are not welcome here,
His meek and mild Chinese.
And if he’s really “struck ”
On them particular,
Why don’t he try his luck
In China—where they are?
If he should do so, we
Will write his epitaph,
Because, most probably,
His pets—it makes us laugh
On whom his soul doth dote,
With humour, weird and grim.
Will calmly cut his throat—
And make a saint of him.

people.

The Institute of Journalists was set fairly
going in Melbourne last Saturday with 92 mem-
bers and the immediate prospect of many more.
Twenty-nine were nominated for the first council
of twelve, and the meeting elected five from the
Age, four from the Aegus, and one each from the
Telegeaph, Standaed, and Hansaed. William
Carrington, one of the Herald subs., was elected
hon. sec. It was decided to ask Chief Justice
Higinbotham to reconsider his refusal of the pre-
sidency, and S. V. Winter and Harry Short, the
latter of whom presided, were elected vice-presi-
dents without opposition.
Every copy of the original edition of
Mudie’s “Felonry of New South Wales” that
came to Sydney was, for some years, sent by
Sydney booksellers to a certain well-known high-
toned lady, by whom, as received, the books were
committed to the flames with a prayer that the
like fate might be even then visiting the Quilplike
author—who, by the way, “ Price Waning” holds,
was far from being as black as he was painted.
Our contributor believes that Mudie was held
responsible for many acts committed by another, in
Mudie’s interest, but without Mudie’s knowledge.
There was a good deal of the virtuoso about Mudie.
One of his hobbies—the fact is now published for
the first time—was the collection of medals ; and
there must be knocking about the country some-
where the manuscript catalogue of the results of
his own gatherings, Major-General Stewart, for
17 days Governor of the colony, was presented by
Mudie with some rare duplicate impressions. Per-
haps they are now in the Museum at the “ Mount ”
—the Stewarts’ Estate, Bathurst —the same insti-
tution where guests were shown the General’s
Waterloo sword. Which, considering he wasn’t
at the battle, was rather a curiosity,
Newcastle (N.S.W.) possesses an artistic
criminal whose love for work has caused a vast
amount of trouble. In the earlier stages of his
nefarious career he used to get into Maitland gaol
now and then for drunkenness, and on these
occasions he was employed in the dull monotony
of raatrmaking—a job which in its horrible dreari-
ness can only be compared with the eternal
“ stitch—stitch—stitch ” of the shirtmaker toiling
in her attic. But on one unfortunate occasion he
was set to work on a big job of masonry, and he
took such a fancy to this novel employment that,
when his term was up, he asked the chief warder
to keep the work for him, as he intended coming
back to finish it. Thereupon he went out, bailed
up an astonished passer-by, and wrested his
loose cash from him. He got back promptly to
his beloved gaol, and pegged away at his favourite
employment. When his second sentence was
finished he tore himself away reluctantly, and
told the chief warder that he meant to get in
again promptly for robbery or something, and take
another spell at the work. In pursuance of this
promise he went into a shop and seized the till in
the presence of the astonished proprietor. He
got three months for this, but his contract being
a very large one, even that didn’t finish it, and
therefore, being once more ejected from the
gaol, he got another short term for a violent
assault on a policeman. Also, he has done
various sentences for breaking windows, welting
harmless strangers without provocation, petty
larceny, damage to street lamps, and riot. The
masonry contract is now—thank heaven—nearly
concluded. On a rough estimate two more assaults
on the police, the breakage of a large sheet of
plate-glass, the use of bad language in a church,
and depositing rubbish in a public place, combined
with unlawfully disinterring a dead body, keeping
a common gambling-house and cutting off a
Chinaman’s pigtail will about see it through ; and
after that, if they set this offender to mat-making
again, he will probably retire from the gaol for
good.

is no more emotion in his voice, and no more
sympathy in Ins acting, than there is a uhiln
sophical consideration of the categorical imuera'
tive in a pound of second-class wash-leather As
Margherita, Signorina Guidotti’s singing was un
more Teutonically emotional than Signor Vilalta’s
although her acting was good enough to redeem
her personation from the commonplace platform
of mere respectability. Signor Melossi’s Valentine
was a complete and consummate piece of charac-
terisation. He was in comparatively good voice
and his farewell to his sister was encored to the
echo. In the part of Siebel, Signorina Cavalleri
acted moderately well, but she was disappointing
in the vocal requirements of the character. The
Marta of Signorina Oastiglioni, albeit a small
character, set a good example to the more im-
portant—or imposing—people in the cast. The
devil scored a strong point in the serenade, and he
took most of his business with the easy security of
one who had been there before, and pretty
thoroughly knew the ropes.
* * *
On Monday “Faust” was represented
with an entirely new cast. Signora Cuttica
represented Margherita, her husband sang the
music of the title role, Signor Sisco upheld the
honour of Valentine, and Signor lorio sacrificed
his sensibilities to the demands of Mephistofele.
The devil of this cast was a serious one; he acted
solemnly, as though time were valuable, and he
sang with a rotund crispness suggestive of a fallen
angel. He lacked the sardonic merriment of his
predecessor, but he was evidently much inearnest,
and laughing seemed to be to him a painful and
altogether unnecessary sacrifice to the heathen
Momus. His conception of the part was, how-
ever, clean-cut and consistent. He never laughed
out of place, and he objected to sing unless
the situation required it. He was altogether
a practical and business-like piece of astral villainy,
of Presbyterian tendencies and a leaning towards
the Baptists of the Hardshell persuasion. Signor
Cuttica’s Faust, without being magnificent, was
sympathetic and artistic. Fie cannot climb up to
a high note with the coppery precision of a Vilalta,
but he gets there just the same, and you like him
the better for it. Siernor Sisco’s Valentine was
far from being as dramatically fine as Melossi’s,
but he looked like the King of Spain in disguise,
with cross-gartered legs and an interest in war-
medals. Marta and Siebel were carefully attended
to by Signorine Cavalleri and Castiglioni, and all
present on both representations were sorry that
these two genuine artistes had not a more spacious
opportunity of enlightening humanity on many
operatic points. The Margherita of the cast was
Signora Cuttica, a vocal gem of something more
than purest ray serene, whose singing and acting
cannot find a comparison on this side of the line,
and whose total presentation of Gounod’s im-
mortal heroine was absolutely flawless. Signora
Cuttica alone is worth the price of admission, and
she did much to redeem the yaucheries of the
chorus and the banalities of the Woolloo-
mooloo brass band ; she gave a charm to the
Levantine pirates who masqueraded as Nnremburg
citizens, and she assuaged the red-striped blankets
of the alleged warriors who gyrated through a
Faustine century. The army of the present pro-
duction was especially strong, numbering, as it
did, nearly sixteen and a half more or less full-
bodied supers. The dresses and scenery were also
very superb, recalling to our minds many operas,
from “Boeaccio” to “ Pepita, ” and innumerable
dramas, from William Baconshaketo Pettit Sims-
On Monday night the orchestra celebrated the
100th birthday of Rossini by the performance ot
the overture to “ The Barber of Seville,” On
Thursday Verdi’s triumphant “Un Ballo m
Maschera ” was put through the operate null
with results pending future remarks.

Sydney Her Majesty’s is still peacefully
meandering towards the apotheosis of Marguerite.
George Rignold continues to hold the mirror up

ance of a hollow devil with an audible leer has
been productive of much happiness to the good
folk who believe in eternal brimstone, but, un-
fortunately for the permanence of such bliss,
George Henry V. R, is himself becoming tired
of the unsubstantial mockery and yearns for some-
thing new. Miss Kate Bishop also has illustrated,
in a becoming costume, the woes of the sainted
girl whom Faust deceived, and G. P. Carey ha
been nightly drunk in an artistic manner for a

‘ There are times, indeed, when the
bursts of approbation would lift the roof off, if it
lidii’t conveniently slide back and allow the stars
above to twinkle-twinkle at the bright little star
below. Marie Halton’s intelligent vocalisation
creates a furore in at least two places. It is the
palpable result of Parisian study of the original,
•uul sorely tempts one to speak boldly of the
gifted artiste as a choice French plum. But for
certain reasons this figure of speech can only be
hinted at. The Bulletin is officially informed
that it has already lacerated, inadvertently, the
feelings of Miss Halton with a Poverty Pointed
paragraph, fashioned as follows :
The dress-circle of Melbourne Princess's held quite a
Gaiety Co. crush of no-forehead Johnnies on the first
„i„ht of “ La Cigale.” “ Dooeid fine tart! V they said—
and her husband was in a stage-box, and the son is
nearly 16.
Herewith The Bulletin coughs apologetically
and rises to explain that the most potent of weekly
publications is powerless to prevent young gentle-
men of no intellect whatever from referring to the
fairest of Eve’s daughters as a pumpkin pie, if
they feel so disposed. As a matter of politeness
we call upon the browless brotherhood to with-
draw their words, but we are not prepared to
affirm that Miss Halton isn't a fine sample
of Nature’s confectionery. And seeing that
admiration for the opposite sex has been vented in
extravagant language since Eve first called Adam
“a duck of a feller ” the present difficulty might
be met by the issue of a managerial manifesto to
the aforesaid Johnnies, desiring them to worship
their newest idol in terms selected by herself and
published on the back of the bill. Personally we
are willing to call the lady anything she likes,
from a snowflake to a little faded flower,
but we must call her sum’ut or we shall
explode. For the rest of the paingiving par.
we cheerfully cancel the information that Miss
Halton’s husband was in a stage-box, not because
he wasn’t there, but because his presence in any
place is of no real theatrical import. Henceforth
he can be on the roof for all The Bulletin will
care, and if ever he should happen to fall off a
tram, or choke himself with indignation, we will
endeavour to maintain a death-like silence on the
matter. As regards the irrelevant observation
that “the son is nearly 16,”it would appear to be
a printer’s misplacement, and probably belonged
by right to another paragraph in a distant part of
the paper. Somebody else’s son was 16. If Miss
Halton has a son he must be a teeny-weeny,
flaxen-haired darling of not more than three, and
half a fairy on the mother’s side. Miss Halton,
we feel much pleasure in suggesting, is far too
young to claim the maternity of a full-grown boy,
and any future observations on her undoubted
talent must be understood to mean that she
promises to blossom into an extraordinary prima
donna eventually, when she is much older and has
gamed a va,st deal more experience of the stage.
I he penalties of youth cannot be avoided.

At the Bijou, on Saturday, business took
alwnT'v turn f° r better. “Caste” has
* been a labour of love with the B. and B.
frou n j’ ail( t as time goes on they seem to put
and ‘p ar H° Ur ' nto the good work. Mrs. Brough
than f 16 Browne, in particular, are stronger
ot yore in their emotional scones, and the
return of George D’Alroy from the grave produces
excellent displays of acting all round. Bouci-
cault, who makes his first appearance as Sam
Gerridge, is disappointing after Brough, who had
every natural qualification for the character, but
Jenny Watt-Tanner makes a very effective
“ Marquizzey ” of a kind quite different to Miss
rlomer’s. Elsewhere all the old successes are
repeated, and when Anson, on Friday night, has
begged his family to have a go at his grey hairs
for the last time, Melbourne play-goers may very
well pause and ask themselves whether they are
likely ever to look upon such a “Caste” again.
On Saturday (sth) there will be a revival of
“ Captain Swift,” which is next door to an abso-
lute novelty. Haddon Chambers’ play has not
been out since Charles Warner made a murderous
attack upon it at the Princess’s.

“The Green Lanes of England,” too)
brought a fair-sized audience to the Alexandra
last Saturday. There are enduring charms about
this intensely British drama, and its greenness
never seems to fade. The hero is drowsily drunk
in a general way, but occasionally they blow a
trumpet, and then he shakes the beer-drops from
his mane and recites “ The Charge of the Light
Brigade ” in a manner that knocks the trumpet
clean out of time. The villain is a plain, straight-
forward character who lives by the sweat of
his brow as a blackmailer. When two or
three young women stand between him and
black mail he chucks ’em in the rippling
stream and cries aloud that they are dead
—although they haven’t been in the water
three seconds and the surrounding country is
within easy reaching distance all the time. The
typical British fayther is another classic prowler
round “The Lares.” His hoary curse is familiar
in his mouth as household words. In times of
peace he tenderly chews his curse and rolls it
round his teeth till his daughter has been be-
trayed, whereupon he disgorges the dainty morsel
and totters off. A fayther who has got rid of his
curse is not much good. He reminds one of a bee
that has lost its sting, or a crocodile with its teeth
drawn, and he might just as well be dead. Dam-
pier’s performance of Gentleman George is one of
the most popular articles on his long list. Sundry
other characters are vigorously played, and Miss
Lily Dampier will doubtless profit by the celestial
advice tendered on Saturday night, when a voice
from the gods cried —“Chuck it off your chest.”

Carl Hertz and the Graggs Family are
steadily blowing the bubble reputation for George
Musgrove’s show at Melbourne Opera House.
Hertz in himself constitutes a continual change
of programme, and his entertainment has a mag-
netic influence upon certain people. Curiosity as
regards conjuring tricks is a complaint from which
ladies and larrikins are exempt, but middle-aged
men take it badly sometimes (even as they are apt
to fall in love), and already the Opera House is
haunted by a few of these unfortunates. They
come early and often, and watch the magician
with wild, bloodshot eyes, but they never get any
nearer to the bottom of his harmless delusions.
A man once wrote to Hertz, stating that he
had attended two hundred performances of the
same trick in London, and yet lie wasn’t
happy. He wanted it to be put back on
the bill so that he could come and see it a few
more times before he died. The Melbourne press
has acquired a taste for Hertz. One night last
week the sub-editor of a solemn organ formed
himself into a committee of enquiry and went
upon the platform to improve his mind. Hertz
put him in a chair that was charged with electri-
city, or liquid dynamite, or something, and the
effect was awful. A sudden rush of ideas to the
gentleman’s brain caused him to bound from the
chair like a young gazelle, and for two days after-
wards he used to sit down upon his head and
dash off brilliant paragraphs with his right leg.
The halls, &0., are fairly in it this race week, and
the final departure of the lugubrious explorer has
filled a long-felt want.
At Poverty Point.
Apropos Signorina Emelia Guidotti's approaching
marriage to restaurateur Rubina, of Melbourne— the
sooner the Signorina marries this young man the better ;
at present he is making the florists disgustingly rich.
Over Hertz and the Craggs, the reigning Musgrove has
the familiar difficulty—Who is to get the first line on the
bill, or ad. ? The see-saw is so nice, and one party
appears to have complained of the apparently unavoid-
able offence of putting one first, wherefore they are side-
by-side, without even an “and,” w’hich might imply
some trifling inferiority. But there have been cases
where even this would not do, and the ingenious manager
has had to invent a criss-cross style of printing the
names, so that there could he no suspicion as to which
was first.
In Melbourne, G. V. Brooke lived in a whilom pleasant
villa which still remains, in Flinders Lane East, between
Stephen and Spring-streets. It is a one-storey brick place,
nicely verandahed, and stood in a beautiful garden, slop-
ing down to Flinders-street. Here Brooke used to study.
Delicious little parties assembled, and a Sunday afternoon
was nice. James Smith, David Blair, Tom Pavey, and a
few more survive of the cronies—not to speak of the
Artful, who is the G. V. Brooke mine. If we want any
copy all we have to do is to “’ave a glass along a’ me,’
under the Shakespeare statue on George’s Richmond
Loggia.

The effer of organist Jude to give a Sunday afternoon
performance in aid of Hobart Benevolent Society and pay
all expenses himself was indignantly declined by the Sab-
batarian committee. Yet Jude gave the lecture,
“ Music and Morals,” and drew in the biggest collection
ever made in Hobart Town Hall. Apropos—does Pastor
Simmons, chairman of the committee which voted against
the acceptance of the offer, forget his own popular
Sunday lectures given in Hobart Royal years ago?
However old an actor, he never thinks he ceases to
require an elaborate make-up as an old man ; however
grey, he must put on a grey wig; however fat, he must
pad for more fat- harmless human vanity. t
The effect of the vision-scene in “ La Cigale ” is spoilt
by the happy ending of the play. What is the moral of
the Cigale’s sudden view of herself as a pauper, in the
midst of the gay masquerade? AVhy, that the gay life
leads her to ruin, hut the manager—we don’t necessarily
mean the Australian manager—has obviously inter-
fered with the author, as did the managers of 11. A. Jones
and Pinero, and the publisher of Kipling’s “Light That
Failed.”
Dear Bulletin, — In a recent paragraph you mention
Mrs. “Jemmy” Grimes as intending to introduce a
“ oorrohoree ” set of music, and remark that this is
probably the first time such a Wagnerian feat has ever
been attempted. Not so. The opening ode at Melbourne
Exhibition of 1866 or thereabouts, called the “South Sea
Sisters”—music by C. E. Horsley, words by “Orion”
Horne—contained a “corrohoree chorus.” I was present
at a rehearsal, where the chorus signally failed to get the
hang of the corrohoree yell. Horne came forward, and,
after a few explanatory words, patterned that yell for us
in a hair-raising and blood curdling manner. This number
at the opening concert received a triple encore. Al-
together, that musical festival had some unique features.
The entire combination—orchestra, chorus, C. E. Horsley,
and all—was “bossed” by a forceful lady named Mrs.
Carl fischer. The orchestra was “ assisted ” by the third
part of an organ—the management couldn't run the cost
of a complete instrument. The chorus included Dan
Beaumont, Ingmire, Blanchard, Exon, Williams, Madden,
and many others more or less known to fame, while
Donaldson, Angus, Maggie and Bertha AVatson, Shenvin,
and the Carandinis warbled the solos. Of the orchestra,
all I remember was that it had a daisy kettle-drummer,
known as Signor Pietro Ganna, who used in off-moments
to revel in warlike inspirations, representing the battle of
Dolly's Bray, or the siege of Jerusalem, or something of
the kind.—Yours, The Ciioweater.
Madame Carandini came to Sydney from Hobart Town
in 1842.

When Carl Hertz was in New York he played the
“vanishing cage” trick upon a peculiarly massive and
sceptical countryman, who had lumbered on to the stage
with a fixed bucolic intention of standing no nonsense.
In due course Hertz gave the cage to this stranger, with
instructions to grab it tight between the two legs of
mutton that served him as fists. There was the cage, and
the canary chirping on the perch. The countryman
hung on to his prey like grim death. Hertz fired a pistol,
or clapped hands, or blew his nose, and in an instant the
grim agriculturalist found himself clutching wildly at
nothing at all. He breathed hard and murmured “H —!”
pianissimo. But when Hertz had pulled back his shaggy
coat and produced the canary from the rural gentleman’s
armpit his feelings could no longer be restrained. He
walked slowly to the footlights and declared himself “ the
son of a &e.

Irving twists AVolsey round to his own personality, as

repeats himself once more. We had the clown and

An old Ballarat digger years ago discoursed on
one of his experiences. Working for wages in a face
single-handed one night he struck two magnificent nug-
gets worth over £lOOO. Prompted by poverty and the
absence of the shift-boss, he retired to a worked-out place,
hid the treasures, and then returned to “ graft,” but,
unable to work through excitement, he fell on his knees
and prayed for Divine guidance as to the disposal of the
gold. After much earnest entreaty, something “struck
him.” It was to hand the gold to the rightful owner,
which he did by turning it over to the boss, to whom,
however, he, of course, said never a word as to the con-
flict in his mind. Well do we remember the hearty
exclamations—“ You did the right thing, William—God
answered your prayer, Bill,”—and so on, which broke in
at this part of the yarn. Better still, somehow, do we
remember William’s conclusion—“ And I’ve been kicking
myself ever since for being such a mug.”

Mount Stewart (N.S.W.) is coming into pro-
minence. It was the same with Lewis Ponds, Costigan,
Cordillera, and other silver-fields at a similar stage of
their existence. The ore-body is reported to be enormous,
the assays published from week to week are influencing
the sbaremarket, and the local correspondent talks of the
“future which Leaderville has before it.” Now, all these
things occurred in other eases where the future was a
ghastly failure. What one needs to know is merely this:
“ Do the published assays represent the bulk average of
the ore-body ?” If they don’t, they are a delusion and a
snare, and if they do, the public ought to be so informed
or they should not be published. The mining investor
ought by now to have lost his faith in assays as a guarantee
of bulk value.
• # *
The celerity with which assayers used to put
through samples in the boom was once clearly explained
to the writer: “ You see, boom times we get more samples
than half-a-dozen assayers could do, but we don’t turn
away work, and get through every sample by employing
a smart boy merely to fill up the certificates of unlikely-
looking rock. You see, it’s merely reducing the thing to
a matter of simple dictation.”

The evolutions of the notorWs “Last-Call”
mine have been extraordinary. Mark Hammond, whose
genuineness throughout his entire connection with it
nobody who knows him for one moment questions,
encountered a series of troubles before he trot the
“under-offer” properly fixed. There were so many “ in
it ” that it is said lie went away loaded with agreements.
Under the impression that the liability ended with the
few pounds put up to send a man ahead, several of the
syndicate instantly struck when asked to put in a marked
cheque for £lOOO to make up the required £lO,OOO for
purchase in the event of Hammond’s approval. He
declined to budge without it, consequently others were
found to take their place, and as one retired at the last
moment, nine represented £lO,OOO. When it was pro-
claimed one of the mineral wonders of the world, the
retiring gentlemen came forward with wonderful com-
placency, and almost fainted when informed that they
weren’t in it. Another large holder who took an early
opportunity of standing on velvet declared on selling
that if it were a frost he would return the purchasers’
money—a promise which appears to have completely
faded from his memory. The anxiety to get out on the
part of persons who by their knowledge should have been
the last, excited suspicion, but unfortunately for the
public the confidence reposed in Hammond's judgment
covered the statements made by disinterested persons
who examined the property unde' 1 entirely different
circumstances.
# * #
The Last Call’s half-yearly report without much
detail admits the mine is a fizzle. The directors regret
that the shareholders have been made the victims of
villainy, but attempt consolation by stating the fact that
they themselves ore the greatest losers by the whole
transaction. They also hold out the flickering candle of
hope by saying that inasmuch as the gold used to salt the
mine undoubtedly came originally from it, operations
will he continued witli the view of striking other rich
veins. The mining-manager, however—and ho ought to
know best—apprehends that the formation is one in
which nothing of permanent value can he found. The
reports clearly prove one thing—that this mine was not
salted in a day or by one man without the knowledge of
others ; that much more time and care were taken in pul-
ing gold into the various places than is usually exercised
in taking gold out of an ordinary mine. On the question
of what steps the directors propose to take with regard
to the suspected salters the report is discreetly silent.
Something may be done if only to satisfy shareholders—
those who bought at £2 especially—but it will end in
smoke. Experience has shown that to “pot” a salter is
harder than to “pot” the Czar.
* *
Distance lends enchantment to a gold-mine. To
make money easily out of a real “duffer,” let it he away
in the back country beyond any railroad or coaching
town ; if there is not even a telegraph w ithin a hundred
miles so much the better. Better still if it is an abso-
lutely new discovery with no old mines around. Under
these circumstances the local inhabitants, if there are
any, will by their ignorance innocently confmmany state-
ments. The man who runs a paper in the town one
hundred miles aw ay will accept everything as gospel and
declare that that town being in command of the traffic
will bulge out, get a railway, and otherwise become a
great centre owing to the discovery. The gist of the local
paper’s editorial will be flashed to Sydney, and the gist of
that will appear in the metropolitan journals, for is he
not the correspondent of all of them ? Only those who
are “ in it” will undertake the journey in the early stage
of the boom. By and by, when the burst comes, an in-
vestor will go up to see the mine. He finds that the
original owners have vanished, the employes are all
drunk at the local pub., and that the small shoot of gold
on which the boom was built has been taken right out —
probably on a shovel.

We have been asked advice concerning several
mines at Pambula. -Now, what would you say to your
friends if you saw ’em quietly sitting in a house which was

The true mining tipster tips himself; the false
one, depend upon it, is himself tipped.
* * *
Beware of the kerbstone mining vampires you
can fall across any day in Pitt-street, Sydney, between
Bridge and King streets. They toil not, neither do they
spin, but have hitherto fattened on the grass-like green-
ness of the ordinary N.S.W. mining investor. Their
stock-in-trade usually consists in a few' pocket-worn speci-
mens, which are the last thing thev part with, and which
have done duty for many mines.
* m m
The man, too, who represents that the presence
of water, or the absence of air in a mine, caused the ori-
ginal owners to leave treasures behind them, should be
headed off. No miner ever turned his back on a proved
golden claim since the world began.
# # *
Turn a deaf ear to the man who tries to make
you believe that the value of a mine is gauged by a trial-
crushing which he has made of a ton of ore.
* # *
Be not wheedled into a syndicate, under the
blissful idea that you are “the first robber.” We have
been there, and have found that instead of being “the
first robber,” we were the first robbed.
* # #
Nevertheless, bear well in mind that all mining
is a gamble and that as long as Nature gambles with her
earth treasures, man will gamble with human nature. To
talk of making mining merely an investment is to talk
nonsense. To make horse-racing an investment would be
comparatively easy.
* * *
Where gambling is a necessity swindles will
always be worked, and the line where, in mining, honesty
ends and dishonesty begins will never be defined. To
give quite a small nut to crack—would the man be honest
or dishonest who, finding a rich reef on another’s pro-
perty, made all arrangements for working same ere re-
vealing his discovery to the owner ?
* * #
A startling fact, A man recently travelled in a
train all the way from Adelaide to Broken Hill without
meeting one single person who disclosed the price at
which he was once offered a fourteenth share in the Pro-
prietary mine !
# • #
Next to the salter —the man who puts gold into
a mine—the mine-thief, the man who takes the gold out
of it, is difficult to gaol. To lay wait for him in a room,
to see him go into a rich stope ; to shoot him when he
came out, would only end in an action by you for trespass
or by him for injury, unless he at that moment had speci-
mens in his possession.

It is as gratifying as it is extraordinary to hear
that the men in Melbourne who more than once success-

There is a whisper in London of civil legal
proceedings being taken by the debenture-holders
of a big Sydney investment company against the
directors in Sydney on the ground of misapplica-
tion of funds. It is alleged that the directors
have exceeded their powers by devoting to other
purposes money subscribed for the purpose of in-
vestment in freehold land. Counsel’s opinion was
being taken when the mail left.
Parkes “ wants to know”:—
“In the event of the N.S.VV. Electoral Bill becoming
law, will the usual course be adopted and Parliament
dissolved to enable the electors to exercise their privileges
n electing a new Assembly under the reformed law ?”
The Bulletin devoutly trusts it will, notwith-
standing the fact that when Parkes’ Electoral Bill
seemed in a fair way to become law he showed no
sign of dissolving Parliament “to enable the
electors to exercise their privileges,” &c. But the
old man is in too great a hurry to grab for the
money-bag. Even with the best of good fortune,
by the time the Electoral Bill is passed and
the Seats Redistribution Bill has been crowded
through, the present Parliament will probably
have been something very like 18 months in exist-
ence. Then tire x-olls for all New South Wales
will have to be prepared entirely afresh, and by the
time that work is finished, the Assembly will be in
a fair way to expire of old age. The chief danger
is, not that the dissolution will be postponed too
long, but that by some unforeseen accident it may
come too soon, before the new rolls are ready, and
that the Foreign-trade-plural-voting crowd may
thus have one more chance with their nefarious
policy under the tail-end of the old system.

There was a frank simplicity about the

An insidious attempt is being made in

Bananaland with the Polynesian.
Brewer Toohey, M.P., no longer plays

the excise-duty off locally-made beer.
Once more the scheme is revived for the
Pacific cable, to unite Australia with America,
but “loyalty” tries to quash it. Twenty years
ago the surveys, by the U.S. frigate Tusca-
rora, proved that the ocean floor is most facile for
this cable. Surely it is all important for us to be
in daily communication with the Great Republic,
far more so than with England.
The Bulletin undertakes to say that
more permanent honour will be done to the credit
of the Australian provinces at “home” by the
collapse of financial institutions directed by “ men
of position and standing” than would be effected
by the wholesale coxxquest of all the Legislatures
by the Labour element. What have the “National”
Association and the “Patriotic” Leagues got to

The title “Commonwealth of Australia”
puzzled the editors of the Almanack de Gotha
for 1892, when treating of the Sydney Convention
of last year. They could not translate it save as
the “ Republique de I’Australie ” or something of
that sort, which would be an official rending of
the silken cords that would never pass muster.
So they put the English phrase in untranslated
and vary it by calling us the “ Etats-Unis de
I’Australie.”

is being thrust aside by imported Kanakas and
Italians and Javanese and Malays. In West

One Manger, who died in Melbourne last
week, played a rather important part, as a Graham
Berry supporter, in the Geelong elections afore-
time. This was when Garratt carried on his
untiring persecution, as some termed it, of Berry.
Garratt also fought Berry at the elections, and
the grave charges he made against the present
knight resulted in the historical Parliamentary
Committee. Garratt’s next game was to move
heaven and earth to get the evidence printed, but,
by some inexplicable influence, he was foiled, or
the history of Victoria would have been changed.
When Lamartine was head of the Provi-
sional Government, in ’4B, the crowd in front of
the Hotel de Ville thrust forward the red flag as
the standard of the Second Republic. Lamartine
rejected it, saying, “The red flag has only been
round the Champ de Mars—the tricolour has
been round the world.” No one could say so
to-day. The red flag has gone right round the
world, from Paris to Melbourne, and from London
to Odessa. It floats over no fortress, and flies
at no masthead, and is an object of hatred to
every capitalistic government in the world. But
the people are everywhere learning to look to it
as their flag—the flag of the workers as opposed
to the cut-throat flags which mean war and class
despotism. It is the Only really international flag
on earth.

forms which surrounded them in the street and in
the house—the forms of the freest people the
world has ever known. Edward Gibbon Wake-
field wrote that Australia would probably produce
a race as perfect physically as the Greek type,
“ but they must be free men.” Just so; as free
from the paralysing influences of caste and
privilege as from the physical tyranny expressed
in the soldiers’ spiked helmet; as free from the
squalid misery induced by British competitive in-
dustrialism as from the sordid viciousness of the
leprous Asiatic.
In Turkey no man’s house can be seized
for debt. When an agriculturist is sold up, his
creditors must leave his home and a certain area
of land, sufficient to support him and his family,
untouched, and no legal process whatever can
deprive him of this property. If a man possesses
an estate but no house, and the Ottoman bill-of-
sale person swoops down upon him, he must not
only leave his debtor sufficient ground to furnish
him with sustenance, but must build upon it a
house according to certain fixed and unalterable
plans and specifications, ere he is allowed to sell
the rest of the property. The device whereby the
bloated Christian throws his bankrupt debtor out
into the snow is unknown among the gentle
Moslems, despite the efforts of British missionaries
to_ teach them the great blessings of rum and
eviction.
“ There is no country in the world where
the number of Civil Servants is so large in pro-
portion to the total population as in N.S. Wales,”
said Rose, M.L.A., while booming the cause of
alleged retrenchment in the cornstalk Assembly.
That is just where the Argyll economist shows
his astonishing ignorance. There is no country in
the world where there are so many legislators—
most of them stupid ones—in proportion to popu-
lation as in N.S. Wales; but the Civil Service, as
the term is correctly understood, is smaller in
that much-abused country than in any other we
know of. The cornstalk “reformer” always com-
pares the N.S.W. service with that of England,
and howls at the discrepancy between the two, and
he doesn’t even know that in England, policemen,
school teachers, railway employes, and the like—
who form the great bulk of the official classes in
Australia—are not included at all. Why doesn’t
the N.S.W. Skinflint-party start by reducing the
Legislative Assembly—the thing above all others
which urgently wants cutting in half ?
Hon. James Munro informed a packed
meeting of Rechabites, at Melbourne Town Hall,

of which he is ashamed.”
In England the savings-banks deposits are
only £07,000,000 from 4,800,000 depositors. In
France they are £112,000,000 from 0,500,000
depositors, and there ate in France 7,000,000
owners of property above one acre in size, as
against 300,000 in England. “In England the
average extent of a single farm is 390 acres; in
France 10 acres (4,000,000 owners, holding pro-
perties of two acres); while farms of 200 acres are
so few that they can be counted on the fingers.
In France there are 8,000,000 acres of common
land, the exact amount which has in England
been robbed from the labourers by successive
Enclosure Acts during the last 170 years. In one

HE NEVER FELT ASHAMED.
The alligator heeds no prick,
It does not make him cross ;
’Tis hard to tickle \yitli a stick
An old rhinoceros:
The elephant shows ne’er a weal
When bricks at him are aimed—
And Jimmy has no cause to feel
A little bit ashamed.
The hide of brither James Munro
Is tough and bullet-proof,
His skull is galvanised, as though
It were an iron roof.
Profuse abuse affects him not,
He cares not what he’s named,
But snaps his fingers at the let
And doesn’t feel ashamed.
He deemed that “meeting to protest”
A Caledonian joke,
lie chose the berth that seem-ed best
For one so nearly “broke”;
It offered him a resting-place,
And, being sorely lamed,
He took it after saying “ Grace ”
And didn’t feel ashamed.
Though vulgar sinners scoff and frown
In virtue he is strong—
The man who represents the Crown
Can never do a wrong.
And why should Jimmy care a straw
How often he is blamed ?
The country cannot pass a law
To make him feel ashamed.
To greatness certain folks are born,
To some it comes by luck,
Whilst greatness from the nettle scorn
’Tis possible to pluck.
Through life and also when he’s dead
For this shall Jim be fatned—
Though curses rained upon his head
He never felt ashamed.
When Doctors Disagree!
Professional etiquette almost always prevents
one doctor finding fault with another’s” treatment
no matter how erroneous he may consider it, but
a case where they quite differed occurred the other
day in the city of Melbourne. A poor, nervous
patient, suffering from the follies of early life,
called upon a medical man, who subjected him to
a thorough examination, and then, putting on his
most sympathetic and serious look, exclaimed,
“My poor man, you are in a terrible and danger-
ous condition, your spinal cord is only hanging hj
two threads, and it will cost one hundred and fifty
guineas to cure you.” This announcement of
course frightened the patient out of a year’s life,
and he considered he had better have another
opinion if the case was so serious, and went to
another doctor, who also examined him carefully
and pronounced “ Dr. is a fool, tor
your spinal cord is only hanging by one thread and
it will cost three hundred guineas to cure you.”
And he got it. So much for frightening nervous
subjects, three hundred guineas for a few bottles
of physic not half so good or reliable as Clements
Tonic. This medicine will cure the worst case of
nervous debility when all the quacks have failed
to.“restore manhood;” a course always results
with success, but it must not be expected that one
bottle will give any man a new lease of life. If
your case is worth treating or your life valuable
to you, treat the case thoroughly and faithfully
and you will meet with the same success as others
do. H. H. Bestman, Esq., Klein-street, Too-
woomba, Q. writes : —“ Knowing that you are
always pleased to hear of the cures effected by
your remedy, I am glad to state that I have
derived great results by its use. Some years ago
I caught a severe cold which induced dyspepsia,
severe pains all over my body, the joints being
swollen, my appetite impaired and a great swell-
ing under my right arm, all finally ending in St.
Vitus’ dance, my body being continually ‘ on the
shake.’ I consulted a physician; he prescribed
medicines, hot baths and rubbing the body with
Rhus. Tox, and so on; but his treatment did me
no good. He then had recourse to Clements Tonic
and said I must take a course of that medicine.
I did so and so recovered my appetite, and ray
strength began to improve generally and in eight
months the shakes were entirely stopped, and
now I am entirely cured, solely by the use of
Clements Tonic.” Patients must be on their
guard against imitations ; insist on having what
you call for, “ Clements Tonic.” Refuse all where
the package has been tampered with. E. M.
Clements, Melbourne and Sydney.

At Barcaldine, Q., a stout lady who had

Father Le Rennetol, S.J., of Sydney, it is
said, has formulated a scheme of rabbit-exter-
mination which is being officially considered. The
chief ingredient is not prayer, as might be
imagined, but bombshells tilled with a new explo-
sive discovered by his reverence.
Barrister McDermott (Vic.), wrangling in
Court with a well-known Q.C. Mac. : “ I knew
your father well, and I did for him what I would
be very sorry to do for you.” “ What’s that ?”

respectable society,” replied Mac. quietly.
It is said that the Duke of Clarence madly
loved Princess Helene D’Orleans, daughter of the
Corate do Paris, and that Queen Victoria favoured
the suit, but the Pope would not hear of the lady
becoming a Protestant. It was only after failing
in that quarter that the Duke began to think of
Princess May.
B. R. Wise’s visit to England was osten-
sibly because of certain family obligations, and
common humanity prompted his constituents to
unanimously acquiesce in his proposal. However,
lie didn’t tell the voters that he was going home
in the interests of a capitalistic scheme, or to help
Carington in his electioneering.
Dr. Reunion, Anglican Bishop of Adelaide,
was once curate at Doncaster, and used to be a
great admirer of hoi-se-racing, but didn’t like the
gambling. He once promoted a “ Bishop’s Stake,”
making it a condition that there was no betting
on the race. The enthusiastic parson’s superiors
froze on the idea, and it was abandoned.
A judicial coincidence. Justices Owen
and Manning, first and second Equity Judges of
N.S.W. Supreme Court, live next each other at
Hunter’s Hill. Both are widowers; each has an
only son, and each son is a barrister. The Judges
are steadfast friends, great floriculturists, and
have gardens of almost unequalled beauty.
The house temporarily occupied by the
Marquis of Salisbury, then Lord Robert Cecil, on
bis visit to Bendigo in ’52, is now occupied by
Mr. J. W. Dower, Cambridge Crescent, White
Hills. The Bulletin mentions this for the
benefit of any globe-trotter who denies that Aus-
tralians reverence “historical associations.”
Southward, a life-insurance canvasser,
who disappeared in Maoriland last April, has just
been accounted for. He fell off the summit of
Mount Egmont, and his remains were found the
other day in the snow, with his proposal-form
still grasped in his ice-cold hand and his non-
forfeitable tontine table of rates in his pocket.
Remenyi, the violinist, an enthusiastic
picture-collector, during his Australian tour
acquired some real gems. At Mrs. Davies’ old
curiosity shop, in Hobart, he bought for 12s. Gd,
a picture for which he can now get 300 guineas.
When his eye first rested on it, she asked 155.,
but he came back a second time and got it for
12s. Gd.
In ’5l, W. O. Hodgkinson (now Queens-
land Minister of Mines), then an impecunious
midshipman, bartered the gold lace on his hat for
a few tarts, in Melbourne, and then “ journeyed ”
to Castlemaine. So he says. “Journeyed” is
his own word, and seems somehow too stylish a
means of locomotion to a man who has just eaten
his last tart.
C. J. Dashwood, the new Government
Resident of the Northern Territory, is a bachelor
and 48 years old. He was not a success as a
member of Parliament and would have been
deserted by his constituents in 1893. Dashwood
may make a good Resident, but if he wants to bo
a good Judge (the Resident holds a judgeship) he
will have to brighten up.
Henry Alford, the veteran S. A. policeman,
explorer, and bushman, died last week. He was
one of Tolmer's famous gold escort in 1852- a
body of troopers who brought gold from the Ben-
digo diggers to their families in Adelaide. Tol-
mer’s gold escort saved S.A. from depopulation.
Alford probably caught more criminals and bush-
rangers in his time than any other constable in
Australia.
Warden St. George, now stationed at
Eidsvold, Bananaland, was the officer who offici-
ally opened the Palmer goldfields, 18 years ago,
with about 50 miners, who made their first camp
at Oakey Creek. Three times in the first night
that camp heard the whish of spears in the moon-
light, and three times St. George rounded his men
up, never losing one, to shoot back. The old man
is getting furrowed and bent.
A CONCLUSIVE REASON.
PARSON [who has wainly been endeavouring to induce business man to accept his nomination
as churchwarden) : “But, my good sir, you owe it as a duty to society. What
possible objections can there be—why do you decline?”
BUSINESS MAN : “Well, you see, I’m cashier of a big financial institution.”
That gkldy shepherd, ex-Pastor Gardiner,
of Sydney, turned up last week in Sydney Insol-
vency Court, where he applied for his certificate.
The Registrar said briefly that the retired
preacher had misappropriated trust-funds and
lost them in wild-cat speculations, that his affi-
davits were unreliable, and that he had exhibited
a shuffling tendency under examination. Conse-
quently expounder G. goes out once more into a
hard world with no certificate.
Alfonso, the dead king of Spain, still lies
on a damp slab in a cave near the old Escurial,
waiting for burial. A thin stream of water
impregnated with lime has run slowly over the
deceased monarch for the last six years, gradually
turning him into a stalactite.; and when he is
properly caked he will be shifted into his regal
tomb, and the slab left vacant for his successor,
and Alfonso will sleep with the long line of pickled
potentates who went before him.
“Mrs. Humphrey Ward, author of
“ Robert Elsmere,” received nearly £20.000 for
her new novel, the “History of David Grieve,”
says the cable-liar. The name of the mad, pub-
lishers? There is no novelist in the world —
unless perhaps Mark Twain, who peddles his own
wares, who would not readily write three novels
to order for £20,000. Mrs. H. W. ought, on the
basis of “Robert Elsmere,” to write ten for the
money. She will be found to be a “one-book”
writer.
The manager of a West Australian bank
has started a Young Men’s Christian Association
at Perth. We have every reason to believe that
the bank is thoroughly sound and the manager
above suspicion, but if we had any money on
deposit we would wake up that bank at midnight
and get it out, or else sit on the doorstep with a
sandwich to keep us up till the office opened in
the morning. The Y.M.C. A. business has proved
fatal to so many banks that we always leave our
money with an infidel now.
Premier Shiels last week received a
deputation in his shirt-sleeves. Minister Bent
once shovelled a load of dirt at Melbourne Harbour
Trust Works whilst going his rounds. John
Thomas Smith, seven times Melbourne’s Mayor,
when Minister of Mines scandalised Turvey-
dropdom by walking down the street shirt-sleeved,
smoking a clay pipe. Another Smith, alias
Carington, once an Australian governor, helped
to publicly shove a railway-truck. These little
performances are supposed to pay dividends.
R. F. Howard, present actuary of the
Bendigo (Vic.) Savings Bank, was the first post-
master on Forest Creek (Castlemaine), and it was
the difficulty of ensuring the regular dispatch of
mails to and their receipt from Bendigo that
induced him to start the first regular mail-coaches
to the latter diggings. Howard was for many
years a representative of Bendigo in Parliament.
In 18G4, MTI wraith, now Sir Tom, of Banana-
land, ran with him at the general election.
Howard was elected, but Mac. was defeated—■
John Halfey, afterwards co-proprietor of the Mel-
bourne Evening Herald with “Langwidge”
Winter, beating him for the second seat.
There is an Australian in Torquay named
Perkins, whom a good many people in Sydney
will recollect as “Fanny ” Perkins. His mother
kept a bonnet-shop in George-street where Thomp-
son and Giles’ lately stood. His father, he was
heard.to say the other day, bought the land on
which this house stood in 1845 for something like
.£2OOO, and the other day be (Perkins) received
over £lOO,OOO for the same piece of land from the
Government. This person is now swaggering
about spending the income derived from this, and
does not, in all probability, pay a penny to N.S.
Wales in the way of taxation. Worse than this,
though, he does nothing but abuse the country,
which he says is going to Sheol.
A Melbourne journalist tells a pathetic
story of that great man, Melton Priah. He had
some business with Priah rather earlier than
usual one morning, and bursting hurriedly into
his room he found that intellectual giant sitting
on the floor cutting his corns. In order to reach
them more conveniently he had taken off all his
clothes, and was lightly attired in thin fringe of
reddish hair and a pair of spectacles. Anybody
who has ever met Melton Pwiah, or has inhaled
the aroma of his dignity at a short distance, is
invited to contemplate this picture. The general
impression which he always leaves behind him is
that he was born with his bell-topper and his stiff
collar on, and very few could imagine him in the
light of a study in the nude.
This generation of Melbonrnites which
laughs so at Beerthirst Magistrate Panton, doesn't
know that it was largely due to Panton’s tact and
moderation as an assistant to Gold Commissioner
Gilbert that the Bendigo miners did not follow —
or precede—the Ballarat men, and provoke a con-
flict with the authorities. Gilbert and Panton
both discountenanced digger-hunting, and many
a time each of them paid a license-fee out of his
own pocket for some poor devil who would other-
wise have had to go to “ the logs.” Had Bendigo
broken out with the Eureka boys, the authorities
would have gone under. This, Lalor told the
writer, was what Ballarat calculated upon. It
was the knowledge that the whole military force
of the colony could be concentrated on Ballarat
that took the heart out of the “ moral suasionists ”
such as Hurnffray.
The late Robert Macintosh Isaacs, when
N.S.W. Solicitor-General, was once heckling a
witness in a squatting case respecting some mangy
sheep. The witness was very positive and pro-
fessed to be a great authority on scab and mange.
Isaacs, however, posed him by asking if he knew
the difference between poor mangy sheep and sheep
pour manger. Isaacs was (like Salomons, Q.C.,
of to-day) a most tiresome punster. When travel-
ling to Fiji with Sir Hercules Robinson in a man-
o’-war his “humorous” propensities became a
terrible bore, so the ward-room officers conspired
to shut him up. They succeeded. One evening
at dinner Isaacs was in one of his word-twisting
moods, and after a more than usually far-fetched
pun the President called out, “Mr. Vice, a pun,”
and rapped the table three times, saying One,
two, three,” when with one voice the mess roared
out, “Ha! ha! ha!!” The effect was killing.
Isaacs did not make another pun for many a long
day after.
A “great” Australian daily, in its Review
of Literature (written “ at home ”) has the cheek
to say that a certain popular novel now issued in
volume form was first published in its weekly off-
shoot. So it was—and simultaneously in twenty
other syndicate papers.
It was a proud boast of old John Cox, of
Mangoplah, N.S.W., that he had never in his life
knowingly done any man an injury, and those
who knew him could well believe it. Many years
ago, a bank foreclosed a mortgage on the pro-
perty of old Nick B , a well-known settler in
the Yass district. The estate was offered for sale
to Cox, who had always a few thousands to spare.
Upon inspecting the place, it did not take him
long to discover that bad management had been
poor B ’s misfortune. Cox returned to
Wagga, arranged to complete the purchase, and
in due time went to take delivery. He was met
by Mr. B , a fine, picturesque, venerable-
looking old gentleman, who was moved to tears at
having to leave his old home. But old Cox had no
idea of turning him out. He said to B ,
“ Thank God, I never tuk the roof aff av any man’s
house in my life, and I’m not goin’to begin now
I’m an ould man. I’ve bought the place for ye,
and here ye’ll stop. Keep it in the name of God
an’ good look to ye. All the bargain I’ll make is
that I’ll have some hand in the managemint, so ’
that ye’ll not make another mess av it.” He had
been so moved by B ’s tale of woe when he
went to inspect the estate that, without saying a
word to anyone, he made up his mind to buy the
place and allow B to end his days in it. How
many‘people are there who would do the same?
No wonder his friend said over his bones, “ God
bless you John Cox, wherever you are.”
The Cause Revealed.
DISCOVERY OF A SUBTLE AND LIFE
DESTROYING ACID.
Anyone who can go through the trying vicissi-
tudes of this climate without suffering from rheu-
matism or neuralgic pains of some kind is
decidedly fortunate. What is it that causes these
pains has been a greater mystery to physicians and
scientists than almost any other question. Some
have declared that they are the results of a severe
cold, others that imprudent exposure has caused
them, and still others that they arise from blood
poisoning.
In order to obtain, if possible, a correct theory
of rheumatism and all the aches and pains which
accompany it, certain authorities in Washington
have taken steps to obtain the views of the
physicians of America upon this subject. These
views are of a varied nature, but so overwhelming
a proportion hold to one belief to leave but
little doubt that it is the correct one. This belief,
briefly stated, is that uric acid in the blood causes
rheumatism, and that it is only by removing this
poisonous acid that rheumatic or neuralgic
troubles, in all their terrible forms, can be cured.
This being true, the important question arises :
“ How does the uric acid get into the blood, and
how can i t best be removed
Uric Acid finds its way into the blood because
the kidneys are weakened and cannot throw it
from the system. Restore the kidneys, and you
will restore the power that will throw the uric
acid from the system, and thus banish the rheu-
matic agonies which it causes.
This is reason; it is science ; it is true. No one
whose kidneys are in a perfect condition was ever
troubled with rheumatism, and no rheumatic
sufferer, however slight the pain might be, has
perfect kidneys. The conclusion of this truth is
inevitable. Perfect kidneys mean freedom from
rheumatism.
Among the doctors in the various cities of the
United States who have certified to the scientific
statements above mentioned, are a large number
of Boston physicians, among them being :
Du. James D. Judge, 358 Columbus a v.
Du. A. P. Lighthill, 332 Boylston st.
Du. George F, Bigelow, ‘ 334 Shawmut av.
Du. Morris P. Wheeler, 741 Dudley st.
Du. Myuon L. Chamberlain, 1!) Exter st.
Du. Robt. W. Newell, 139 W. Brookline st.
Du. Albert N. Blodgett, 390 Boylston st.
Du. Chas. M. Newell, 1074 Washington st.
Du. William K. Kiplky, 297 Columbus av.
Du. William A. Dunn, 00 Chambers st.
Du. George C. Shattuck, (> Newbury st.
Du. William Ingalls, 550 Tremont st.
Du. Michael F. Galvin, 540 East Broadway.
Du. Franklin P. Patch, 4 Marlboro st.
Du. Darius Wilson, 10 Temple pi.
Du. Charles W. Stevens, 54 Elm st.
Du. Wm. M. Cornell, 135 W. Concord st.
Du. Henry W. Bradford, 0 Beacon st.
Du. Nathaniel Downes, 49 Maverick sq.
Du. G. Wilson Atwood, 17 Tremont st.
Du. Chas. A. Feunald, 1483 Washington st.
Du. Francis H. Brown, 75 Westland av.
Du. Hamilton Osgood, 390 Boylston st.
There never was, and, probably', never will be,
but one remedy that can, in every case, drive uric
acid from the blood. That remedy is Warner’s
Safe Cure. It cures rheumatism by driving the
deadly uric acid from the blood. It banishes pain
by removing the cause. It acts directly upon the
kidneys. Within an hour from the time it is
taken its influence will be felt. It sustains the
organs that sustain life, the forces that make the
blood. For ladies during the severe ordeals through
which they are called to pass it is invaluable. For
the nervous troubles of youth and the debility
that precedes old age it has no rival. There are
thousands of men and women, too, who are in
perfect health to-day wholly by reason of its
great power, and it is the most popular remedy the
world has ever known.

Two absolute essentials for the existence
of the human race are—land and air. Many
economic and political systems have been invented
and are advocated for obtaining land for each
individual to live upon, but it has been left to the
Hydraulic Cooling and Ventilating Co. to intro-
duce pure air into every habitation in Australia,
by means of their “Perfection” Cooler and
Ventilator. By attaching this machine to your
water supply or tank, and simply turning on the
tap, a constant stream of pure, fresh air can be
obtained in any chamber you desire. Punkahs
are thus superseded, perishable goods can - be kept
at a small expense without ice, and you can enjoy
the luxury of a cool chamber on the hottest day or
night. The machine, which is simplicity itself,
works at the cost of one half-penny per day, while
the price brings it within the reach of most.
Send for particulars or inspect the machines work-
ing in our offices. T. A. Knight and Co., >St.

(owing to its heavy outlay on its splendidly-
situated new premises) running to the bad finan-
cially at the rate of a couple of thousand a year,
but is, nevertheless, still very chary about whom
it admits to membership. By the way, a little
while ago an eminent Sydney physician of unchal-
lengeable social status put up for membership, but
was blackballed. He had —subsequently explained
his supporters—offended the R.C. Church in days
gone by. A little while afterwards a well-known
Roman Catholic barrister of equally high charac-
ter was nominated —and was enthusiastically
pilled by the doctor’s friends. A truce has since
been declared and both gentlemen have been
elected.

While Lady Jersey and Lady Galloway
were in Maoriland recently, the train by which
they were travelling from the Lakes to Dunedin
was stuck up by floods at a country place called
Milton. Learning that they would have to pass
a night here, they telegraphed to the local hotel
for rooms. By the same train, though, there
travelled also the members of a second-rate variety
company, including a conjuror, a song-and-danco
artist, and a two-faced, or two-voieed, or two-
something woman, and these also telegraphed for
accommodation to the same hotel as the authoress
of “One People, one Destiny.” The variety
people were the first to arrive at the humble
hostelry, and the unsuspecting proprietor took
them for the Jersey party, and obsequiously
showed them to the best rooms—the only ones he
had left—in his house. Shortly afterwards Lady
Jersey arrived and requested that she should bo
conducted to her rooms. The truth then dawned
on the horror-stricken hotelkeeper and he begged
the variety people to give up their rooms. But
they refused to budge, and their Ladyships of
Jersey and Galloway had to pass the night in the
servants’ bedrooms, the domestics being turned
out to make room for them.
A gilded swell visited Australia in a yacht,
»nd after the manner of his kind, kept himself in
a condition of bright chromo all the time. The
other Sunday morning he took it into his head to
go to church, and, in his mazy mindlessness, put
on his go-to-meeting suit without transferring a
solitary coin to its pockets. During the setvice
he felt fearfully shaky, and, calculating on getting
outside as soon as possible to see a man, made the
awful discovery that he hadn’t a stiver on him.
Just then the collection-plate came round'. He
noticed the lady next to him take out her purse
and extract a shilling therefrom. He had never
seen her before, but be bluntly accosted her with :
—“ Please lend me a shilling to put in the plate?”
What could she do? She gave him the shilling
which he calmly put into his waistcoat-pocket.
And then he went out and got a drink.

When, just before the final farewell ban-
quet tendered him. Governor Onslow called upon
the Mayor of Dunedin, and incidentally com-
plained of feeling tired, his Worship replied ; “So
am I, your Excellency, awfully tired ; I have been
wa’king about all day, trying to sell tickets for your
banquet .” An ominous silence ensued, during
which you could have heard an elephant fall. At
the banquet, a fussy old potentate asked for and
got three cheers for the Governor. “Now,” says
he, “ three cheers for the Governess !” They were
enthusiastically given.

The standard work on N.S.W. Supreme
Court procedure is “ Pilcher’s Practice.” This
book was really only edited by Pilcher, Q. 0., the
actual compilation was made by Prank .1. Smith
(who last week received seven years’ penal servi-
tude) and another legal gentleman, who not long
since got three years for forgery. From which it
would seem that even lawyers who compile books
for the guidance of others can’t always keep out of
gaol.
# * #
It is said that the reason why the N.S.W.
Minister for Justice has put the ticket-of-leave
system in force is to get some of the lesser
criminals out of the gaols to make room for the
bank and building society brigade. Now that
the Government has so many expert financiers in
its employ, the Treasury books might be handed
over to them to settle the vexed question whether
the Parkes Government left a deficit or a surplus.

Dear Bulletin, — John Harris, the de-
ceased millionaire of Shane’s Park, N.S.W., was
a married man after all, and what is more his wife
survives him. They were so long separated and
so far removed from each other that the chances
are the lady doesn’t even know that he is dead —
possibly she never heard of Shane’s Park, and her
husband’s immense pile. What a cold day there
is in store for the other twenty-eight relatives
when she turns up ! —Yours, T.S.

An Ipswich (Q.) man had a case against
the local Small Debts Court bailiff, and obtained
a verdict and costs —in default, levy and distress.
The bailiff made default, and the creditor got an
execution, but the bailiff refused to outer in and
take possession of his own furniture without a
guarantee to cover expenses ! The creditor ap-
pealed to the P.M., who explained that, under
the District Courts Act, the bailiff rendered him-
self liable to be sued for the recovery of a debt
lost by the non execution of an order. The credi-
tor is now in this position—that if the bailiff
declines to seize his own goods in satisfaction of
the verdict, the creditor can sue him again for the
amount lost through his omission and so on ad

greets him effusively, making no mention of the
unpaid debt, and they take a drink. “Oh,
Naphthali,” suddenly says M., jun., “the old
man wants a diamond ring. That ought to be in
your line. Try and get him a good one, cheap.”
Later, Nap. waits upon the old Malthazar with

There is an old Sydney deacon as deaf as

onwards, but the visitors, when half-way, quietly
slipped into a vacant pew. Arrived at the

Thus a Southern correspondent :
Dear Bulletin, — An artillery-officer was going for a
picnic the other day and told a sergeant that he wanted
four men and a N.C.O. at his quarters at 8.30 a.in. with a
hand-cart to remove some baggage to the wharf. Said
“ hand-cart” weighs a ton and was made to be drawn by
two horses. The baggage consisted of two bundles of
rugs, a tent, two tin-boxes, two fowling-pieces, and a five-
gallon keg of beer. This potentate receives £350 per
year salary and quarters, also an Imperial pension of £3BO,
yet he would not pay a shilling to a carter to remove his
picnic comforts. He would sooner see four poor devils
of men dragging an artillery cart through the streets on
a broiling day.

the man who can wheedle most of the small
people’s savings into his hands to do as he likes
with, who can scoop the largest profits out of a
“ boom ” founded on falsehood and maintained by
fraud, and who can reveal himself as the meanest,
most contemptible of skunks when the boom col-
lapses, and yet keep out of gaol. “He’s only a
deuced bad financier who gets into gaol ’’—Lord !
what a series of addresses could be delivered from
that text by a strong man ! He’d make another
land boom, with all the concomitants of vicious
luxury, sanctified swindling and gambling, and
robbery of the poor under the guise of “ promoting
national prosperity,” impossible for a full genera-
tion.

THE JERSEY LIST.
Come gather round and shudder now, ye aspirants to
ton,
The Countess, with a darkened brow, has got her eye
upon
The names of some who used to come and taint her marble
hall,
And put away their quarts of Mumm whene’er she gave a
ball.
Her spirit proud abhorred the crowd, there’s not the
slightest doubt,
And so a mighty vow she vowed to weed the duffers out.
List, list, list—she pauses now and then
To put a cross against the names of certain bogey men.
List, list, list, aiid scores of ladies, too,
Will snort and swear and tear their hair—the list she’s
going through.
There’s Dickey Dash, of Manly Beach, with wife and
daughters four,
They used to get a card for each—they’ll never get ’em
in ire;
And Tony Lagge, of Potts’s Point (a “loyal” beast, you
bet!)
His broken nose is out of joint, he’s boosted from “the
set ” ;
And Mrs. Spree, at dear Coogee, will clench her dainty
fist,
For something has been said, you see, and she is off the
list.
List, list, list—a lot of larky dames
Have got the Jersey cross against their fashionable
names.
List, list, list—She’s adding one or two,
But, now and then, she takes her pen and strikes a
dozen through.
AT THE FUNERAL.
To-day we buried 11 Bossy ” Brown,
We gathered round his grave,
And as they let the coffin down
A sort of sigh we gave.
Of all the men we knew in town
He was the biggest knave.
He ne’er performed a kindly deed
As far as any knew,
lie never offered one in need
A solitary sou. ;
But on this sad occasion we’d
A duty “ for to do.”
“ Poor fellow !” said the “ mourning ’’ crowd
As Bossy went to bed ;
Each gazed into the hole and bowed
A cool, uncovered head.
And, all the time, we all allowed
The beast was better dead.
“ Poor fellow !” one must use the word,
’Tis humbug’s solemn whim,
No bosom by his death was stirred,
No eye around was dim—
This secret thought to all occurred,
“ We’ve seen the last of him.”
We bustled off (we’d played our part)
With sober biz’ness air.
Before the train for town would start.
Ten minutes still to spare—
We turned into the Bleeding Hart
And tossed for liquors there.

Dear Bulletin, —In your “Answers to
Correspondents ” last week you wipe out the
question of feminine equality with one brief and
comprehensive statement: “ A woman is not a
man, nor is a man a woman, and things unlike
cannot be compared. A man and a woman are
no more equivalent quantities than half-a-mile
and 4s. Bd.” All of which is very brilliant no
doubt, and at the same time very irrelevant. “A
man is not a woman nor is a woman a man ”
therefore it is no good talking about the equality
of the sexes ; and, on the other hand, one man is
not another man, neither is another man the first
man, therefore it is no use talking about the
equality of men, and democracy, republicanism,
one-mau-one-vote, and all similar doctrines go to
ruin in one act. The argument you use against
woman is just the argument that the corpulent
Tory of the “ National ” Association uses against
you. Again, “a man and a woman are no more
equivalent quantities than half-a-mile and 4s. Bd.”
Perhaps! Did you ever see half-a-mile eloping
with 4s. Bd., or grovelling before 4s. Bd. and
asking it to marry and be happy for ever after-
wards, or wedding that 4s. Bd. and then loafing on
its money for the balance of its natural life ? Did
you ever see half-a-mile come home drunk and
jump on the miserable 4s. Bd. and stave its ribs in,
or do you know any case when it lived by driving
that exhausted sum of money in the shirt-making
business at 2s. Gd. for sixteen hours’ hard toil? if
man will assume towards woman the same reticent
attitude that the half-mile assumes towards the
fifty-six coppers, and neither associate with it, nor
maltreat it, nor make money out of it, then he has
a right to strike a lofty attitude of superiority,
and then only. Further, you say: “To state
that there are powers and capabilities which men
and women hold in common is to beg the question;
the differences are real and marked and cannot
be bridged over.” You speak here of physical
differences, but are not the mental differences
between (say) the soulless British agricultural
clod and such a writer as Walter Besant equally
marked? Yet you want to have them made equal
by Act of Parliament. This seems rather incon-
gruous.—Yours, Titus Salt,

Cablegram:—
London, Tuesday Night.—A valuable discovery has
been made at Portaferry, a seaport and market town in
County Down, Ireland. While a grave was being dug a
sum of £20,000 in gold was unearthed.
This kind of thing—“A valuable discovery has
been made,” &c. —is an insult to human intelli-
gence. Ten thousand in gold had been found in a
grave, and to solemnly set forth in long primer
that it was “a valuable discovery” is to assert
that this avaricious and grasping nation hasn’t
enough sense to come in out of the wet. Boil it

short chain —the lunatic has no show. In one of
Mrs. Beecher-Stowe’s novels there is a story of a
well-meaning but horribly dreary man who talked
for two hours and a half to a paralysed woman on
the necessity for calmness and resignation. The
unfortunate audience had only sufficient power to
move her eye-lids and her jaws; otherwise she
was helpless as well as speechless. At the end of
the two and a half hours “she sorter beckoned
with her eye ” to the well-meaning man, and when
he came close up she bit a good-sized piece out of
him. We commend this item to the consideration
of asylum chaplains—and of asylum lunatics.

It is the correct thing now in high-toned
American society to rehearse a wedding over and
over again before the actual ceremony comes on,
so that all parties concerned may be perfect in
their parts. The bride and bridegroom practise
kneeling down at the altar, getting up again,
fixing on the ring, and all other details. They go
over the entrance and the exit from the church,
and walk up the aisle at different rates of speed
till they strike the one that seems most dignified.
The bride gets up assorted expressions of counten-
ance, and her friends and relatives decide whether
she should come in looking pale or wearing a
blush, whether she should look nervous and timid,
or calm and self-possessed, or whether she should
wear a smile. They rehearse positions at the
altar —leaning forward, standing erect, Grecian
bends, etc., and make the responses in various
tones till they hit the right one. Then by the
time the real ceremony comes on all the details
are correct, and all the romance has been trodden
out of the thing, and everything has become as
commonplace and prosaic as a mud-bank on a wet
day, and it is hardly worth while getting married
at all.

If there is a good-natured, accommodating,
kindly, and absolutely unselfish ass on earth,
it is surely the man who will write to a paper
stating that ho is in the habit of associating on
familiar terms with the gaol-flogger, and that he
likes the flogger, in a social sort of way, as a com-
panion, and feels better for the flogger’s society.
An alderman of Woollahra (Sydney) is just this
sort of ass, as witness the following letter, pur-
porting to come from him, in Sydney Tboih :
In justice to a man I consider being persecuted, I would
like to say a few words. I hare known Ellory personally
for some years, have been in bis company frequently, and
had numerous business transactions with him. lamin a
position to prove that lie numbers amongst those who
respect him—as I do—gentlemen of position and integrity
in this city', and I am certain they will bear me out that
he bears a character for respectability, honesty, sobriety,
and principle that not many warders or officers need he
ashamed of. It is because 1 know him as such that I take
this opportunity of defending a man I deem is being per-
secuted.
In other words, this alderman is prepared to vouch
that Mr. Ellory is a kind-hearted flogger, a
thoroughly honourable and gentlemanly scarifier,
and is much respected by all who know him—but
who haven’t been flogged by him—as a high-
principled remover-of-skin and flesh-agitator. And
now The Bulletin would like to know, merely as
a matter of curiosity, whether the alderman ever
asks the hangman to drop in to tea with his noose
sticking out of his pocket, and, if so, does lie
invite the hangman and the flogger on the same
evening, and in that case what do they converse
about ? Also, how does the hangman figure in
the giddy valse at the alderman's suburban man-
sion, and how is the flogger on the light fantastic
toe?
A Funny Game.
A few friends met the other night in a Newtown
store to spend a jovial evening, but as they were
all teetotallers and none of them drank anything
stronger than Clements Tonic, drunkenness was
out of the question. Mac. proposed a game
at euchre, and Jones said they had better play for
something just to give the game an interest and
make it lively, but times were hard, so they did
not care to play for money. Smith, however,
spied a box of Fletcher's bilious and liver pills,
and proposed that each time a man was beaten he
should take a pill, and this made the game lively
and the fun was fast and furious. Simpson
swallowed five, Jones got away with four and
Smith and Hopkins two each and Mac. got off
scot free. The game terminated by a general
exodus at 3 a.m., for Dr. Fletcher’s pills never
labour in vain. They are the best and mildest
pills made and are sold by all chemists and
druggists everywhere; being a positive, safe,
and reliable cure for constipation, liver complaint,
headache, &c. They always give satisfaction.
The proprietors give away £5O (in seven prizes) at
Xmas, for the seven first nearest guesses sent in,
as to how many of these pills a large Clements
Tonic bottle (now full) holds. A guess form is
around every box, and all such forms are eligible
for this competition that come from around a box.
One box of Fletcher’s Pills proves their virtues

SPORTING NOTIONS.
Providence, which always seems to smile upon
the V.R.C., sent glorious weather for the Newmarket
handicap day at Flemington, and the general attendance
was about large enough to meet the Club’s heavy outlay
in stakes and hairpins. The Governor managed to get
there, in spite of the new baby, and most of the represen-
tative persons who haven’t called a meeting of creditors
were there likewise, without their wives. It looked, in
fact, as though many of the best ladies of quality had
stopped at home and gone to bed out of sympathy. Very
likely they had. When the famous Duke of Burgundy
became as bald as an egg his courtiers shaved their heads,
and Lady Hopetoun’s predicament is much more interest-
ing and worthy of imitation than the Duke’s. Which is a
delicate reminder that sport opened with the Hopeful
Stakes, a “dead-bird” for Long’s stylish filly, Lady Ed da.
The admirers of Strathmore were not enraptured with the
Derby winner’s appearance as he stood stripped in the pad-
dock. The coat that had bloomed in the Spring was not so
bright-looking on Saturday, and the great horse seemed
in danger of being taken dow n for the Leger by Oxide,
Until one took observation of the latter. Oxide, appar-
ently, was also a trifle off-colour, and so the two horses
ran relatively in their old form, La Tosca being an easy
third, and the long • legged impostor, Swordbearer,
sprawling in the rear. Thirty-three horses—a monotonous
mob of well-trained cattle for the poor punter to select
from—came out for the Newmarket. Half of them were
certain to win and the rest couldn’t lose. On paper
Bungehah should have done it, inasmuch as he won the
same race by twenty yards last year, and the extra
weight he now- put up could make little difference to
the biggest horse in the paddock. Moreover, Bungy
looked so muscular and chirpy that people pushed for
the privilege of backing him for a place. The difference
between one Newmarket and another obtrudes itself right
here. The speed that seemed so marvellous last year
was, on this occasion, barely sufficient to keep Bungy in
the front rank, wherefore the veteran lost heart and
finished seventh. Wild Rose, who won a good stake for
the G’Naroo stable, has shown some wonderful times
before Saturday, but she doesn’t quite seem to fill the
stage as a Newmarket star. Fortunatus, the runner-up,
is only a pony, and Harbour Light, who finished within
two lengths of the winner, has suffered about as
many defeats, in moderate company-, as there
are hairs in his tail. It seems odd that the
Wilson party, with such splendid. appliances at
hand for testing Pygmalion’s character, could back the
horse for a heap of money without ever getting a ghost of
a show of winning it, but they did. Pyg. may have a day
out during the meeting, but he is an expensive beast to
follow, anyway. Zalinski, on the other hand, will always
be w orth ba -king whilst he has four legs to travel on.
The Trenton blood is in him, and he is never beaten until
the post is passed. On Saturday it was plain that Zalin-
ski wasn’t quite “fit ” in the sense of being “thoroughly
wound up,” but he was fit enough to beat Highborn,
Megaphone, Stromboli and Tirailleur at weight for age,
and will improve on that gallop as the week goes on.

Ned Lord will probably row at Putney-, but the other is
not certain. It is possible that J. C. Garrick may be
tried. Experts predict already- a win for Oxford, who
have so many old hands, while the Cantabs will have at
most three old blues. But you never can tell.

The V.R.C. has some notion of reviving an
agitation to get the privilege of charging for every- visitor
to Flemington course. Act of Parliament now stops it,
and a few- years ago the club committee vainly attempted
to persuade Government to bring in a Bill handing them
entire control, with a view to charging. On a big Cup
day this would make a difference of £2OOO, at a shilling a
head, but the Amateur Turf Club charges 2s. at Caulfield.
The case is the same as with the M.C.C., which had to
exercise years of intrigue ere it could secure the right of
excluding the people from their own park.

idea is too ludicrous. Johnel, at latest, weighed nearly

The secretary of a Victorian cricket club tells
this painful story-: He called on a generous M.L.C. to
request a subscription for the club, and the M.L.O.
promptly produced a sovereign. The secretary didn’t
like to rush on the coin like a famished beast of prey, so
he sat and chatted for a few minutes with the money
still on the table. Presently there was a rustling of skirts
outside the door, and the M.L.O. sat up in alarm, and
gesticulated eagerly to intimate that he should seize the
coin. At the same moment a lady entered—a dried-up
sort of lady with yellow features and an old and haggard
eye. The sovereign was the first thing that drew her
attention. “What’s that?” she demanded promptly-.
“It’s only a small donation,”said the husband, uneasily ;
“The local cricket club, my dear.” “Oh!” said the
lady, “ Half-a-crown’s enough.” And then, before
the eyes of the astonished secretary, she peacefully
annexed the sovereign, fished out half-a-crown from the
recesses of her clothes instead, and went away. The
secretary takes no more chances now. If he sees even a
sixpence he flies at it like a vulture rushing on a dead
body, lest some other woman should walk in and say that
twopence is sufficient.

Like every other Apremont the writer can re-

was a game Apremont.

The old saying, “Given a good horse in good
condition and with a clever jockey up, and you can hardly
handicap him out of a race,” seems to hold good with
boats also. The 22-footer Portia, owned by popular
young Willie Booth, of Balmain, and sailed by that king
nf sailing masters, George Ellis, has recently won four
handicaps in succession, the fact that she has been
brought further back each time appearing to have no
effect on the result.

Dear Bulletin,—l’m astonished to see a
democratic paper countenancing two classes of amateurs
—bonafide and manual labour. The distinction is un-
known outside Australia. What is wanted is the enforce-
ment of the true amateur principle, which would exclude
the “ amateur” who follows the sport for gain. To say
that manual labourers are physically at an advantage is
absurd. At pedestrianism the well-nourished college
novice with elastic joints is superior to the youth whose
limbs are stiffened by hard fare and harder toil. Only by
continuous practice does the pro. overtake the amateur
whose training is by starts and bursts. This question
reminds me of the old Henley definition and London,
A. wrangle when the (wholesale) “gentlemen
engaged in commerce” would not meet the (re-
tail) “fellows employed in trade.” Plow poor
Pendragon used to sneer 1 To their credit be it said, the
young swells of Oxford and Cambridge ended the despic-
able quarrel, by volunteering to meet the humblest
athlete, provided he followed the sport for sport's sake
only. The new movement was inaugurated in 1831, when
Raby, a farm labourer, won the walk, and three ’V arsity
men had the hurdles to themselves, our friend Tom
Malone, then a bhoy from Clare, was a good second to
Davin iu the long jump, and B. R. Wise won the mile.
B. worked hard to abolish all social distinctions
between true amateurs. No wonder that he, in disgust,
a few years ago, refused the presidency of a Sydney club
which raised the manual-labour barrier. —Yours, V.

Gregory must be a certainty for the next test
match, to he played in Adelaide! Several of the English-
men said that his 93 not out was the most perfect innings
they ever saw played. The following is about the best
team Australia can produce for the Adelaide test match :
Turner, Banr.ermah, Gregory, Callaway, Trott, Bruce,
Blackham, McLeod, O. Gillen, Lyons, and Tarrant. Trott
is the most doubtful man in the team, but his innings of

that he is getting back into his old form.

for 405., really for over half a million sterling.
Dear Bulletin, — A “toff” shearer, popu-
larly credited with being nephew to a bishop and
a bank-manager and the son of no end of a swell,
shore (scab, of course) at a station in the Namoi
country, but was “roomed” and “fed apart”
from the common ruck. Some money, a bank-
draft and an order, &c., amounting in all to
over £3O, belonging to a unionist shearer, were
stolen from the office cashbox where they had
been deposited for safety, and the amount had to
be made up by the two gentlemen who had it in
charge. Several honest shearers were suspected
of the mean theft, and much' enmity and uneasiness
were caused among hitherto mates. At length,
suspicion centred on the “toff,” who was plainly
informed of the fact, and given every chance of
restitution, but his aristocratic soul preferred that
others should remain under a cloud as well as him-
self. However, a bobby bailed him up while
aboard the outward-bound coach, and the loot
was found on him—notes endorsed by the loser-
concealed in his boot. The “toff” was presented
at the nearest police-court. Now, a near
relative of the prisoner drove the emergency
magistrate over to the court, and doubtless
the two fed together on the road. The magis-
trate let the aristocratic prisoner off with
a fine of .£2O, and delivered him over
to his friends in good condition. At
the end of the case, prosecutor audibly expressed
his opinion that the “toff” had been unduly
favoured, and that, had the thief been a common
worker, without influential friends, he would
have seen what gaol life was like. The magis
trate at once suggested “contempt of court,” and,
had not an unusually intelligent constable in-
formed his worship that “contempt” couldn’t
“lie” after the case had been disposed of —
though, whether that is law or not, seems
open to question—the prosecutor would probably
have had to study cell walls for seven
days, for expressing his opinion honestly. Will
Tub Bulletin try and procure a definite and
authoritative decision as to whether the posses-
sion of influential, rich, and holy relatives carries
with it the further privilege of exemption from
the punishments that are in all cases heaped upon
the heads of the erring who have neither bishops,
nor bankers, nor influence to back them up?—
Yours, &c., Shearers’ Probity.
Over 1500 foxes have been destroyed in

An English newspaper interview on the
toe-nail question ;
The toe-nails can be as much improved as the nails of
the fingers. It’s a pity girls don’t take a little more care
before they get engaged. It takes a good three months
to get the average toe-nails into presentable shape. We
always find our customers impatient to be guaranteed
“all right” in such and such a time. They are, of
course, being pressed to name the day, and they cannot
do it, as, of course, you can understand, till their toes are
as nearly faultless as possible —they are far from it, as a
rule. Dark stockings have been worn so long that ladies
have come to understand that “ stain ” is not necessarily
soil. It is just as unsightly, though. All this must be
got away, the toe-nails bleached and then tinted, and as
far as possible some beauty of shaping given. Modern
custom requires the wearing of shoes too small.
Of course, the toes must suffer, in beauty as
well as iu other ways. The nails get cramped,
distorted, discoloured and very ugly. What do
you do ? It takes an hour or so a day. The foot is
kneaded and rubbed, the nails carefully cut into shape,
the “ moons ” coaxed to appear—just as on the fingers.
Then home treatment is dictated. Girls sleep with their
feet bandaged, with bleaching and softening preparations,
with their toes bound upon splints, and their ankles
shaped by binding. We, of course, can only accomplish
w'hat the foot permits. We can make the skin soft,
smooth and white ; give, perhaps, some plumpness where
it is needed, and make the soles soft and pink, give tint
to the tiplqpf the toes and to the nails, make the heels
rosy, and bring perhaps all the moons in sight if we have
time. A cared-for foot is, I assure you, a thing of beauty.
It’s one of the first things a girl looks after when she gets
engaged.
THIS WILL SETTLE THE QUESTION.
“ I don't believe there is a word of truth in it.”
That’s the way certain foolish people talk when
they hear of anything unusual, or outside the
limits of their own observation or experience.
They are of the sort who laughed at Stephenson
when he introduced the railway, and at Morse
when he said that we could communicate by means
of electricity. Yet they don’t laugh at those
things now. They make use of them daily.
Some months ago the case of Mrs. Mary Cuddy
was first published. The great public accepted
the facts, as they had every reason to do. Others,
a very few (professional men perhaps) pretended
to doubt, and sent emissaries to inquire of the
lady herself whether her allegations had not been
added to, or altered, for the sake of popular effect.
Here is her answer! She repeats what she at
first said, and puts a quietus on all who called
her words in question. It will be observed that
her statement is as plain and solemn as language
can make it.
[copy.]
I, Mary Cuddy, of 28, Catherine Street, Rich-
mond Road, Leeds, do solemnly and sincerely
declare as follows :
Ever since I was a girl I have suffered from ill-
ness. I always had a pain both before and after
eating, and never seemed able to gain and keep
my strength, and felt that something was pulling
me down. I had a nasty queer feeling in my
stomach. Sometimes food seemed to ease it, and
at other times it made me feel worse, and often I
went without food, for I was afraid to eat. Com-
monly when food was placed before me I could not
touch it, and I often fainted at the very sight of it.
After a while I became so weak I could scarcely
stand or walk. I thought it was consumption
coming on by degrees and I took all sorts of
medicines to try and get relief, but it was of no use
and I got tired of taking physic, for I had lost all
faith in it. My business was so urgent that I was
compelled to be at work, otherwise-I would have
laid in bed, so weak had I become. With the
weakness and loss of appetite there were other
feelings and signs that were bad and alarmed me
greatly. Among them were these : —A yellowish
colour of the skin and eyes, sometimes a cold,
clammy perspiration, pains and aches in the sides,
the chest and back, headache, a kind of wind or gas
coming up into my throat and mouth that was so
sour and sickening I could scarcely bear it. Once in
a while I would have a strange fluttering and pal-
pitation that made me think my heart must be
affected. My heart would thump so that I feared
it would jump out of its place, and I have had to
walk about the room for two or three hours at a
time, for I could not sit or lie. The pain was so
severe that I have asked my husband if he could
not hear my heart thumping as I walked about.
I always slept badly at night, and frequently had
horrible dreams, and was so melancholy and
depressed in spirits that I would sit down and
cry, for I got no pleasure as time dragged wearily
by. I had so little energy or strength that it was
all I could do to summon courage for the labour
upon which the family (at least in part) depended
for support. I am a dressmaker, and it will be
easily understood how hard my life was, for I
didn’t think it would last much longer. Not long
ago (May, 1887) I made up my mind to try a
medicine that is advertised and known all oyer
the country. I mean Mother Seigel’s Curative
Syrup. I had no faith in it at first, for how can
one believe in what one knows nothing about? I
bought and tried Mother Seigel’s Curative Syrup
only because of its reputation. How could so
many people, I asked myself, praise a medicine so
much if it had no virtue ? I can only say that I
found what they said to be true. After beginning
with the Syrup, relief soon followed. My food
digested better and gave me strength, and by
persevering with it all my pains disappeared. I
could eat my food with a relish, and everything
agreed with me. Now and again when, through
confinement and hard work, I feel a touch of my
old complaint I take a dose or two of Seigel’s
Syrup and the trouble goes no further. Since the
publication of my testimonial many persons have
called at my house anil asked me if all that is pub-
lished about my case is true, and if the Proprietors
of Seiycl’s Syrup had made, additions to my state-
ment.
I told them all that every toord teas true and
nothing had been added by the Proprietors of the
medicine, but I could add a good deal more, for no
words can describe what my sufferings were
during all those long years. I never expected
being well again in this world. Seigel’s Syrup
saved my life and I desire other sufferers to know
of what did so much for me. I will gladly answer
inquiries.
And I make this solemn declaration con-
scientiously believing the same to be true, by
virtue of the provisions of the Statutory Declara-
tion Act (Will. IV., c. 62.)
(Signed) Mary Cuddy.
Declared before me at Leeds, in the
County of York, by the said Mary
Cuddy, on Monday, the 10th day of I
August, 1891. (
(Signed) Alf, Cooke,
Mayor of Leeds. J
Not a syllable further is needed except to say
that her ailment, indigestion and dyspepsia,
burdens and saddens the lives of many other
women (and men also), who will read with new
hope the outcome of Mrs. Cuddy’s case, and place
a confidence which no cavilling can shake, in the
remedy which restored to her the health and
happiness that Providence designs for us all.
Vincent Pyke, one of The
Maoriland contributors, introduced into the Vic-
torian Parliament the Bill for establishing a
branch mint in Victoria. The effect of the
measure was to fix the price of standard gold at
.£3 17s. per oz,
A certain Sydney “banker,” who has just
gone bung, started business with .£15,000 lent him
by a retired tailor, the bargain between them
being that he was to pay the tailor 15 per cent,
and deposit with him the securities on which he
lent the money ; anything he could make over
15 per cent, was to be his own. He did so well
that he was soon able to dispense with the tailor’s
patronage, but presently he started out, like all
the rest of them, to own the entire earth, of which
he acquired, to speak allegorically, all but about
320 acres. In endeavouring to get this last half-
section he broke his financial back.
When the newspaper man retires from
business a certain halo still hangs around him, and
if he was a well-known individual casual drinks
come in his way for five years afterwards on the
strength of his old position. The other day a
Sydney man, who used to be among the best-
known journalists in the city, came across the
owner of one of the many forlorn, dead-looking
“big buildings” that have sprung up of late
years, and began talking. “That place of yours
must be an awful white elephant,” he remarked.
“ White elephant! Bless you, no—have a drink !
—grand place ! Just let me show you through
it.” They had a small bottle of champagne
each (at the landlord’s expense—of course), and
then they went through it. “ This,” said the
genial owner waving his hands in the air in a
general sort of way, “is probably the finest site
in the city—have another drink.” They had
another small bottle of champagne each, and then
they continued to go over the property. They
shinned up to the roof, and scrambled down to the
basement, and dodged through all sorts of places.
“ Grand central situation, as you may observe,”
said the proprietor cheerfully, “ commanding
position—have a cigar.” They had a shilling
cigar each, and then they started afresh. “ The
capabilities of a property like this are absolutely
boundless—let’s have another big bottle —it only
requires a little'assistance from men like you to
make it known.” “ From men like me! ” said the
ex-journalist, lifting his open countenance out of
his third Dint of fizz; “How can I make it
known, pray?” “Why, of course, you know,
men occupying an influential position on the
press, you know ■” “I’m not on the press,”
said the retired writer, promptly. “ Not on the
press !” said the owner, in a wild, give-me-back-
my-expensive-drinks, where-is-my-vanished-cigar
sort of tone: “Why, aren’t you on the ?’
“Left the press five years ago,” interposed the
recipient of champagne. “But, anyhow, you
have influence in newspaper circles, through your
long connection with them, and a word from you
” “Haven’t any influence,” said the ex-
newspaper man curtly. “But still,” said the
other, in a despairing lone, as he thought of the
vanished drinks, “You meet lots of press-
men ” “ Never meet one of them ; haven't
met a pressman since 1888.” “But you must
know them.” “No, I don’t know any of them.”
“Oh, well, good-day,” said the fat landlord, in
sad, stomach-pump tones.


Chicago has a street 24% miles long.
Last year 19,714 persons left Great Britain
for Australasia— 2000 less than during the previous
year. 252,171 left for the States.
London Daily Telegraph thus starts a
gruesome tale of death from hunger: “At one
o’clock on the morning of Saturday—a cold, black,
dismal hour —the dead man, unknown, came
along the street and sat down on some trestles. ”
Minister Buchanan, of the U.S., was,
with one exception, the only person attired in
black at a London diplomatic reception. The
other exception came and asked him, “Are you
the butler ?” “ No, are you ?” enquired
Buchanan.
Is it not palpable that the great lager-
beer case, before the Melbourne Courts the other
day, was an advertising dodge? Even a sort of
criminal prosecution can be made a monstrous ad.
The pros, begin to talk of something termed a
“ divorce salary,”
It is, after all, by no means certain that the
Swedish sailor, who, it is alleged, was deliberately
murdered by larrikins in George-street, Sydney,
lately, did not meet with his death through fall-
ing from the steps of the street “ offices ” outside
of which he was found.
Suppose the N.S.W. Inspector-General of
Police became aware that a brace of detectives,
prosecuting in a criminal case, raised £25 by
getting their own joint personal bill, without
other security than their names, discounted by
the lawyer defending in the same criminal case—
what would he do in the matter ?
By cable from head office, the general
manager of the New York Life Insurance Co.,
Mr. Josiah Howell, is informed that the total
assets of the Company at Ist January, 1892, are
■£25,915,080, a gain during the year of over
£2,000,000, with a clear surplus over liabilities of
£3, 105,432. The total income for the year
(>£0,554,300) and the new business written
amounted to .£31,000,000, while the expenses have
decreased by over £lOO,OOO.
Mr. Josiah Howell, general manager for
Australasia of the New York Life Insurance
Company, is officially informed by cable that the
position of president of that company, rendered
vacant through the resignation of Mr. Wm. H.
Beers, has been filled by the unanimous election
of Hon. John A. M‘Call. The appointment
of Mr. M'Call, formerly Insurance Commissioner
of the State of New York, gives great satisfaction,
as his past record gives guarantee that he will
prove a worthy successor to the retiring officer in
safe-guarding the interests of the policyholders in
the great company over whose destiny he has been
chosen to preside.

OUR DARLING BABY
WHAT IT IS CAPABLE OF
Has it ever struck you how many things a baby
can do and feel none the worse for it? It can turn
a once peaceful and happy home into a howling
wilderness, and then smile in the face of its suffer-
ing father just when he is in the act of pulling up
his great coat collar under his ear preparatory to
going out in the cold night to keep an imaginary
appointment in the city. It can occupy both
sides of the largest-sized bed simultaneously with-
out the slightest discomfort to itself. It can
make itself look like a fiend just at the moment
when mamma wants to show “ what a pretty baby
she has.” It can look its father innocently in the
face, and five seconds later spoil the only good
coat that he has got in the world. It can make
an old bachelor in the house adjoining use
language that if uttered on the street would land
him in gaol for a month. It can go to sleep like a
little angel, and just as papa and mumma are
starting for the theatre it can wake up and stay
awake until the beginning of the last act. But
that is only one side of the question. A baby can
make the commonest home the brightest spot on
earth. It can lighten the burdens of a loving
mother’s life by adding to them. It can flatten
its dirty little face against the window pane in
such a way that the tired father can see it as a
picture before he rounds the corner. Another
source of gladness to every well-ordered household
is a bottle of the world-famed St. Jacobs Oil, a
family medicine that has done more to relieve
human suffering than all the other patent nostrums
ever placed in the market. From amongst
numberless testimonials recently received attest-
ing the efficacy of St. Jacobs Oil in the relief and
cure of such diseases as rheumatism, backache,
headache, neuralgia, toothache, sprains, bruises,
cuts, &c., the following by Mr. A. T. Burton, of
Concord Park, near Sydney, is worth perusal.
He says;—“l consider St. Jacobs Oil a most
valuable remedy, and always keep a supply of it
in the house. In cases of rheumatism, neuralgia,
and sprains, and aches of all kinds, it relieves and
soothes the pain. About 18 months ago I sprained
my arm, when I used the oil to good effect. It
relieved the pain at once, and after a few applica-
tions effected a complete cure.”

CHARCTER AND STERLING WORTH.
No article, however well advertised and pushed,
can ever become a permanent success unless it
possesses sterling merit. That the famed Water-
bury watches possess merit of the highest degree
is borne out by the enormously increasing demand
for them, and the spontaneous, genuine testi-
monials which pour in from wearers of them daily.
Mr. J. R. Filewood, of Fernbank, Shoalhaven
district, writes : “ I have worn one of your short-
wind watches (series “J”) for over 18 months,
and I would not exchange it for any watch I ever
saw I have worn it out camping
in the wet and working on the goldfields ; and it
keeps as good time to-day as the day I bought it.*
This watch cost the owner 225. Gd. The new
series, “ K ” for gentlemen, and “N ” for ladies,
are perfect models of timekeepers, having very
superior finish, six jewels, and all the latest im-
provements. They may be obtained in nickel,
sterling silver, or rolled gold cases, the prices
ranging from 255. to 635. Make it a point to see
them before purchasing a watch.

All throat and lung diseases, Ayer’s Cherry
Pectoral is the best known remedy. When the
bronchial tubes are sore and obstructed with
phlegm, this medicine is invaluable. It is an
anodyne expectorant, and, in cases of deep
seated consumption, it cures the coughing,
soothes and heals the lacerated tissues, and
induces refreshing sleep. A few doses are usu-
ally sufficient to afford speedy relief in cases of
Golds and Coughs
It is also as speedily efficacious, and prompt
to allay the distressing symptoms of asthma,
bronchitis, sore throat, hoarseness, croup, and
whooping cough, and, in thousands of fami-
lies, is the only cure used. It is the best emer-
gency medicine and should always bo at hand.
No household in which there are young chil-
dren, can afford to be without

H. GRAYSON CROSSLY .... General Manager.
Keaa-‘A Golden Shanty.’
John Wesley the Snag.
(For THE BULLETIN.)
The quaint name which heads this sketch
belonged to a picturesque-looking old chief of the
Ngatimaniapoto tribe, Maorihmd. In its native
form it was Hone Wetere Te Rerenga, of which
John Wesley the Snag is a literal translation. Hone
had been “caught young” by the missionaries,
and, in addition to his tribal name, had received
by baptism the name of the founder of Methodism.
But the nomenclature carried with it no saving
grace, as Hone was just about as “bad” a Maori
as you could have found if you iiad raked all Maori-
hand from Capo Maria van Dieman to Foveaux
Straits. His chief Biblical hero was Joshua, but
he had his doubts as to whether the sun really
stood still. He scouted the portions of holy writ
relating to Jonah and the whale, and the Creation
and the Nativity as unworthy of credence. Ho
was a kai tanyatci (man-eater or cannibal), an eye-
swallower, a devotee of the Pai-manri supersti-
tion, a rebel against Kuinc Wikitoria, had mur-
dered Missionary Whiteley (grandfather of
Whiteley King, of the N.S.W. Pastoralists’
Union, by the way) and drunk his blood —and was,
in fact, everything that was undesirable in the
eyes of the orthodox pakeha.
* # #
I first met Hone in 1884 in a wild, out-of-
the-way part of his ancestral demesne. He had
then been under the ban of outlawry for 20 years
and there had been a standing reward of,a couple
of hundred pounds on his tattooed head all that
time, but as his retreat was almost inaccessible
and his henchmen numerous, well-armed and
valorous, few and half-hearted had been the
attempts made to earn the blood-money. As he
was an uncatehable outlaw a vast tract of country
was tabooed to the settler through his outlawry,
and at last Native Minister Bryce decided to
grant an amnesty to Hone and all other Maori
offenders who would promise to obey the law in
future. Hone jumped at the chance of pardon
with its concomitant advantages of unrestricted
visits to the pubs, of frontier villages, &c.. and
displayed as great a desire to become a “good”
Maori as he had previously exhibited to bo a bad
one; the Government, to encourage him in well-
doing, actually gave him a position in the Civil
Service—as pilot at the Mokau River. It wasn’t
a very responsible billet, and the emolument
attaching to it was only some .£4O a year and a
brass-bound c?ip, but I verily believe that Hone
thought more of bis new title of Captain than
he did of his tribal mana and his un-
challengeable ancestry of thirty generations.
# # #
The occasion of my foregathering with Wetere
was a visit paid by several members of the
Government to his territory—a journey made with
the object of showing that the authorities
regarded his submission to the pakeha as sincere.
The chief wore his staring new naval cap, an old
serge coat, and a blanket around his loins, dis-
playing his brawny, copper-coloured legs, from
knee down. He took a violent fancy to me right
off, squatted on his hams in front of me, and com-
menced the process of chumming up, “ Kapai
God !” he ejaculated. I smiled faintly and bowed
affirmatively. “ Kapai Jesy Keriste.” I remarked
that I thought so too. Then he dug down into
his Scriptural recollections and “ Kapai’d ” Adam
and Noah, and then Solomon, and Sir George
Grey, and Bishop Hadfield and Queen Victoria,
and all the persons alive and dead that
he thought my pakeha susceptibilities would
cause me to admire. Then he sidled up close
to me and whispered, “But no good,
Mita Miterahena (Mr. Mitchelson, the Minister
for Works). He wantee mo join the - prn
ribbon army.” Wetere might have continued his
confidences further, had not one of his followers
informed him that I was not the Governor, but
merely a tan rika rika of a reporter. His interest
in me suddenly ceased when he found that I was
not a ranyatirn, and a few seconds later he was
“ kapai ”-ing the God head and the Guelph family
to the Minister for Public Works.

Sydney, in the colony of New South Wales, do hereby
solemnly and sincerely declare as follows :
Whereas, I suffered very severely from a very
troublesome affection of the Nerves, which affected me so

no avail. Whereas, I, as a last hope obtained some of
Herr Rassmussen’s PURELY HERBAL

CURED ME within a few weeks, and although this is
over five years ago, I have remained well ever since.
The DENMARK UNIVERSAL PILLS also cured
my wife, and I make this solemn declaration, conscien-
tiously believing the same to be true.

OPINIONS OF THE PRESS
Proving the Wonderful Cures to be Genuine.
-. ■ ■ ■ ■
“ Herr. Rassmttssen’s World-famed Denmark Universal Tills are
purely Herbal, and is the best remedy in the world for curing and
preventing disease.” —The Times.
“ Herb Rassmussen’s, the Celebrated Danish Herbalist, well-
known Herbal .Remedies have been the means of performing many
great cures during the last few years, as his numerous testi-
monials will prove,”— Sydney Bulletin.
“ Herr RASsMussENhas shown us some highly complimentary
Testimonials which he has received, certifying to important
cures effected by his Remedies.”— Sydney Evening News.
“We have been shown some excellent Testimonials of the
great cures performed by Herr Rassmussen, the Celebrated
Danish Herbalist. Herb Rassmussen is a gentleman who has
gained for himself a reputation in the medical world or herbal
science. He has been practising as a qualified herbalist so long in
Sydney tliat his name nas become known throughout hew Couth
Walesand Australia. ” Australian Star.
“ We are continually receiving letters from Herr Rassmussen’s
Cured Patients, requesting us to make known the wonderful
virtues his world-renowned Herbal Remedies contain.”—
Sydney Weekly News.
“Herr Eassmussen’s name has become a household word
throughout the Southern Hemisphere. He was presented with a
magnificent Gold Medal for some of his marvellous cures.”
Balmain Leader.
“ Herr Rassmussen is too well and favourably known to the
Australian public to require any additional praise from ‘ Truth.’
His Herbal Remedies are unequalled.”— Sydney Truth.
“ The remarkable Cures effected by Herr Rassmussen’s Herbal
Remedies are pretty generally known.” — Balmain Observer,
“Herb Rassmussen, we are glad to say, as a Medical Herbalist,
bolds the highest place in the Colonies, and enjoys the confidence of
many of the leading people in K.S. Wales, Victoria, and Queens-
land.”— Uooktown Courier, Queensland.
“ Herr Rassmussen counts his cures by thousands, has already
acquired an Australian Reputation, and has secured the respect
and gratitude of num°rous patients whom his remedies lias
restored to Health and Happiness.”— Centennial History
of N.S.W.
“Herb Eassmussen’s Remedies have cured more diseases than
all the other remedies put together.”—Republican,
“ Who have not heard of the numerous Cures effected by Herb
Eassmussen’s Denmark Universal Pills.”— Australian F riend.
“ All the principal Analysts and Medioil Experts have proclaimed
Herr Rassmussen’s Denmark Universal Pills to be the best in

“Herb Rassmussen is a skilled botanist.” Launceston
Daily Telegraph, Tasmania.

has now been established in the colonies for nearly 10 years.’’—
Sydney Sunday Times.

Medical Practitioners in these colonies, judging from his enormous
practice and his wonderful cures, and bis great skill has been
recognised in many ways. He has also been rewarded with a
magnificent Gold Medal for effecting wonderful cures ” — Sydney
Freedom.
A REAL MAN OP MARK.
“ Herr Rassmussen’s Cures are so remarkable that we make no
apology for referring to some of them, Mr. Ramsden’s case is the
most wonderful, and he cured him in six weeks, after all the
Sydney doctors gave him up. We may also state that a gentleman
in this district, who has been a martyr to the demon Dyspepsia for
more than two years, after trying several “doctors” with no
benefit whatever, is recovering under Herr Rassmussen’s Herbal
Treatment. In this age of unblushing quackery it is well to flud
a man of Herr Rassmussen’s undoubted skill, and we wish him a
lono- life to continue his useful mission in the cause of suffering
humanity.”— Kangaroo Valley Pioneer, N.S.W.
A JUST REWARD.
Herb Rassmussen, of whose Famous Herbal Remedies everybody
has beard, is yet a young man, and has held the position of Lecturer
to several botanic Societies in Australia , be soon became known by
his wonderful cures of which he has numerous tokens of grateful-
ness, including a beautiful Gold Medal, brought him into the front
rank of Botanic Scientists ; now he is the Proprietor and Discoverer
of the famous Denmark Herbal Remedies, all of which have
secured the honest support of the people, not only of Australia,
but Africa, the United States, the British Kingdom and Italy.
It is not for us to enumerate the various remedies prepared by this
really learned man, but having seen and examined letters from all
parts of the world, we are assured that he has saved a world of
suffering and cured people of many complaints, after they had
given up all hope.”— The Australian Workman.— Sydney,
January 9th, 1892.

Statistician Hayter : There are ten per-

years.
England imports annually some £3,400,000
worth of margarine. The bulk of this bogus
butter comes from France.
During ’9l the paper values— market

Ambrose Bierce says civilisation consists

The fascinatingly blue lakes at Mount
Gambier (S.A.) are just now as rapidly and
steadily falling as a short time ago they rose.
Eighteen indies in two or three weeks has been
recorded, and three inches in one instance in two
days. Natural evaporation can account for
nothing like this in such large volumes of
“ plumbless waters.”
The case of Gustav Adolf Streseman, who
turned up at Vanrook-station, Gulf country, after
being bushed 13 days without provisions, and who
was naked and blistered and so ravenous that he
fell tooth and nail upon a batch of uncooked
dough, is another illustration of the fact that it is
quite a usual symptom of famine-madness for the
Victim to tear off his clothing as if it oppress d
him beyond endurance.

Ah Sin was up in Queensland recently for
stealing two water-fowl from a stupid Quaker.
“When did you miss the two ducks?” asked
Police Sub-inspector O’Driscoll, pointing to the
fowl in Court. Quaker: “I missed only one
duck, your Worship.” O’D. : “ You cannot
understand the question. You have identified
these two ducks as your property.” Quaker
(seriously): “ One of them is a drake.” Even the
Chow grinned.

I have read several versions of the murder
of Capt. Logan, the Commandant at the Moreton
Bay penal settlement, from 1825 to 1830, but the
true one is in ray possession, in a diary of one of
the convicts engaged in the transaction. This
diary was given to me by the convict’s son. When
Logan’s murder was reported at Limestone (Ips-
wich) the search-party who went out were accom-
panied by Dr. Cowper, the Government health-
officer, who, after examining the remains, gravely
expressed an opinion that “Capt. Logan was
killed by aboriginal weapons ! ” The story is too
long to give in detail in this column, but the fact
is that Capt. Logan was flogged to death by his
own convict servants, or rather they started to
flog him to death, and finding him hard to kill
they finished the work by smashing his head. He
was battered nearly out of resemblance to
humanity and then flung faee-downwards into a
hole a couple of feet deep, one of the
men observing, “ put the looking
down to hell, for that’s where he’s going to !”
The convicts at the settlement manifested insane
joy at the news of the murder, and sang and
hoorayed all night, in defiance of the warders.
Logan’s ferocious cruelty made the history of his
reign a chapter from the Inferno. It was during
Logan’s time that men killed their mates in order
to be taken to Sydney and hanged, and dozens
escaped into the bush to risk all its unknown
terrors and cannibal savages, in preference to
their unendurable servitude. Logan’s body was
taken to Sydney and buried with military
honours, His widow applied time after time in
vain for a, pension, until finally granted an
annuity of ,£7O. The old convict’s diary, the
diary qf the man who helped to flog Logan to
death, is an interesting document.

A Western squatter, well-known for his
unspeakable meanness, had a manager to whom he
gave the munificent salary of £2OO per annum.
About six inonths ago two commercial travellers
stayed a night at the station, accompanied by
some choice whisky. Under the influence of this
Caledonian nectar the squatter grew somewhat
garrulous and inflated. He told the commercials
that he_ “ paid the highest wages in Queensland,
and I give my manager £4OO per annum ” ! The
manager was listening. Next day he waited on
the boss and said he was tired of station life and
would go down and settle on the coast. In the
meantime he would take the balance of his past
year s salary at the rate of £4OO per annum ! The
squatter laughed derisively. “Very well,” said
the, manager, “ I shall sue you for the amount and
call those two gentlemen to prove from your own
statement that you pay me £4OO salary !” And
after careful but bitter consideration, the squatter
compromised by giving £lOO more than was due
and the manager departed rejoicing.

In the early days, “ old Paddy O’Sullivan,”
M.L.A., a member of Queensland’s first Parlia-
ment, and still an honoured legislator in the
Assembly, took his warehouse trip round the
country with a horse-team and a waggon. One of
his principal debtors was a prominent colonist
> w h° postponed settlement until
W® Bibernian warrior could stand it no longer.
Faddy has a sharp tongue and a sharp pen. He
sat down and wrote some sarcastic verses calcu-
ated to make Mollish “ sit up.” Then he strolled
gently down to Mellish’s office and read the
sparkling satire to the astonished individual him-
self. “ Now,” said P. 0., “unless you pay me in
20 minutes, begorra Oi’ll paste thim verses on
every gum-tree from Mount Hutton to Dalby,
and likewise insert thim in the Dalby Hieeald !”
And M fell over a stool, rushing to get his
cheque-book. Having heard the verses recited by
the genial composer himself, I can appreciate the
frantic desire of M to get the bill settled.

The idea that Cowley, the Queensland
Minister for Lands, converted Griffith to kanaka
labour is a pure delusion. Cowley has next to
no influence in the Cabinet, and certainly none at
all with Griffith. In any case, whatever he might
say to Sir Samuel on the subject of kanakas
would likely have an effect the reverse of the
intention. The actual reason of the “ten years
extension ” lies chiefly in the misunderstanding
between Sir Samuel and the Labour-party. The
planters declared war against him, and ended
by drinking “Confusion to Griffith” in Mackay
bars and bar-parlours, because he announced his
intention to place some salutary check on their
unconscionable abuses of the Polynesian Act, and
their reward was—the annihilation of the kanaka
traffic ! The Labour-party treated his advances
with suspicion and derision, and he replies with ;
“At least ten years more of kanaka labour !”
This is plainly indicated in the manifesto.
* # #
No man living knows Sir Samuel better
than I do. He is a lonely man, a stranger in the
crowd, a sojourner among his friends, much of
Diogenes, much of Aristophanes, an isolated
planet revolving on his own axis, his light brilliant
without heat, surveying mankind from afar off
through intervening ether colder than ice. His
faith in mankind is small, his contempt boundless.
As a Judge he would be stern as Rhadamanthus,
unsympathetic as the grave. We may debate the
merit of all his services to the country, but they
have taken years from his life, made him pre-
maturely old, and his name is unsullied by even
an enemy’s suspicion that personal gaimever in-
fluenced his legislation or administration. His
energy is perpetual, his mental endurance ap-
parently exhaustless. His friendship is not born
of ardent sympathetic sensibilities, being little
more than an impassioned recognition of merit.
His friend is only a fine picture, a graceful statue.
If he were a bachelor and courting, ho could give
notice of motion that, onacertain day, lie “would
move that, in the opinion of this House, his
personal regard for Miss So-and-So justifies him
in taking formal possession.” His dislikes are
bitter as the waters of Marah. Prom him the
political teleologist retires baffled.

The first attempt to introduce coolies from
India was in 1838, when G. R. Mayo applied for
a tract of country at Moreton Bay to start a coffee
and cotton plantation. He also asked for a grant
of Eagle Farm, six miles from Brisbane, then the
female convict settlement, and made a proposal to
utilise the women as labourers. In reply to the
coolie question, Lord Normanby wrote to Mayo,
on the 12th of March, 1839, to say that, “ the
introduction of Indian labourers is in direct
opposition to the policy of Her Majesty’s Govern-
ment.”

How many people know that “Fanny
Bay,” at Palmerston, in the Northern Territory,
was named after Fanny Carandini by the Marine
surveyors ?
Bailey, the Queensland botanist, is a true
democrat. He hates titles and Imperialism like
pizen, and expresses himself on the subject with
great freedom, if necessary. On his recent visit
to South Australia as Queensland representative
at the Science Congress, his democracy came into
collision with the Royalism of Baron Mueller.
The Baron was fussing round saying, “I have just
seen Sir So-and-so.” or Baron this, or C.M.G.
that, “ have you seen him, Mr. Bailey ?” This
became monotonous until Bailey observed “Oh,
damn yoUr titled friends ! I haven’t seen them,
and don’t want to see them. I’m not in the lick-
spittle business; they can go to !” Here
Bailey paused for want of a suitable destination.
The horrified Baron exclaimed “ Ach! mein Gott!”

The first white woman on the Darling
Downs was named Kate M'Ginnis. Her nationality
has never been disputed. She was housekeeper in
1842 on Leslie’s Canning Downs station, now the
property of the Hon. J. D. Macansh. Kate was
an honest, blue-eyed brunette from the south of
Italy, and spoke Irish fluently with a foreign
accent. There is no record to show if she left any
descendants or whether she was the last of the
illustrious house of M‘Ginnis. She had a lonely,
cheerless life in those wild, rough days, but lived
and toiled and soothed many a sick bushman’s
pillow, like other true Australian pioneer women,
and so she shall not vanish trackless into blue
immensity

The latest theory derides the idea that

Such results, it is claimed, are really brought
about by tiring a single line of nerve.
The other day a Sydney Technological
Museum official showed a potentate over that
institution for a full hour, under the impression
that he was Minister Suttor. Having pushed
aside everyone else to make room for the all-
important F.B.S., the attendant was paralysed
when the visitor signed himself, on leaving, “John
Blank ” —a Newtown grocer. The cream of the
joke, however, was the matter-of-fact way in
which the august visitor (a J.P.) received the
official's oppressive civilities.

(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
When the dew lies deep on the upland lawn.
And the clouds are tipped with gold,
When the first grey gleam of the early dawn
Breaks over the sleeping wold;
Then far and near you will always hear
A voice both loud and gay :
’Tis the little grey bird whose song is heard
A-bidding the dawn good-day.
For he laughs “ Ha, ha,”
And he shouts “Ho, ho,”
Whatever may come to pass ;.
Sure if ever on earth there’s a haven of mirth
’Tis the soul of the laughing-jackass.
When the sun peeps in at the breakfast hour
And rouses the swagsman lone
To find that the ’possum has filched his flour,
Or the cat his mutton-bone ;
Then, close by the way on some ragged spray,
The jolly grey bird is seen
A-splitting his sides, for he seldom hides
The sound of his satire keen.
For he laughs, &c.
When deep in the heart of the pathless b
Some wight has lost his way,
Or down in the creek with a broken hub
The waggoner toils all day ;
Then the little grey bird, you may take my word,
Atop of some neighbouring tree,
Is waking the wood to his mirthful mood—
“ What a jolly good joke,” thinks he.
For he laughs, &c.
So all day long over hills and shawes
The little grey bird will go,
And wherever a man’s in a fix he’ll pause—
Oh, just for a joke, you know ;
And when night time comes, in the leafy gums
He will hide himself from view,
Where he dreams of snakes till the morning breaks,
As most of us sometimes do.
For he laughs, &c.
G. H. MITCHELL.
Writes a correspondent : —
The Bulletin has had a glorious career among the
natives of New Guinea. It was in this way : Last June,
when my mate and I went over, we penetrated very far
into the interior. At a village called Tunora, on the
head of ihe St. Joseph River, we happened to open a
pack in which, among various articles, were some old
Bulletins which we had brought over from Cooktown.
The niggers had apparently never seen paper before, so
they pounced on these Bulletins and admired them so
much that we were enabled to trade them off for three
large bunches.of bananas. The chief and his leading men
carefully removed the covers, which they kept as their
own especial share. The leaves of the paper were made
into cigarettes which they smoked in bamboo pipes, of
course using the native tobacco, which grows luxuriantly
in the interior. Shortly after this we noticed a com-
motion at one end of the village. Lo and behold, the
chief and his men had most artistically decorated their
heads with Bulletin covers.
The Bulletin has a considerable respect
for the wooden part of the Bench, but the meat
part of it is beneath contempt. At Castlemaine
(Vic.) two swagsinen who asked a resident for
something to eat have just been sent to gaol for 12
months. At Bendigo (Vic.) a brothel-keeper and
procuress, who was proved to have girls
of 13 years to her house and lived on the proceeds
of their degradation, was duly convicted before
the local court, and the law, after talking to her
like an outraged parent, gave her a fortnight in
which to clear out of the city. It will probably
cost her about £5 to move her harem to another
town. |

Mrs. P’s Love-Potion.
DRAMATIS PERSON JO :
Mrs. Polly Pdblicou.se, Licensee of the Haivk’s
Inn (buxom, brazen, bewitching).
Jack, or Johnny, a drover—not altogether unknown
to Mrs. P. —going East with cattle.
A blacksmith, bar-loafers, stray dogs, heat, dust and
flies, as required.
Scene. —The bar of the Hawk’s Nest Inn, Paroo
River (W. A.)
(Mrs. P. discovered washing glasses).
Enter Johnny (smiling),
Mrs. P.—
Hullo Johnny, I am pleased to see you’ve come
back,
Johnny—
Burn me, but I’m mightily glad
I didn’t go round by the Hungerford track—■
(Calls to the Groom)
You needn’t unsaddle my prad—
I had half a mind to, they said that a flea
Could be flogged from the Border to here,
But it’s much of a muchness as far as I see—
Mrs. P. (wiping a glass) —
What’s your liquor?
Johnny— I’ll take a small beer,
Just a mouthful to wash the dust out of my
throat —
And, besides, Mrs. P., there was you,
’Twouldn’t do to be near and not call.
Mrs. P. — Jack, you goat,
Make an end of your foolishness, do.
(insinuatingly)
But, Johnny, you don’t mean to say you won’t
stop.
Oh, you must stay and hear all my news.
Johnny—
I must go to the cattle, my men ain’t much chop.
Enter Blacksmith and others.
Blacksmith (with empressement) —
Hul-10, Johnny, old man, have a booze ?
Johnny (hesitatingly) —
Well, Ted, as it’s you, why, um, let it be “Scotch,”
For friendship, I can’t stay to chat.
They’re waiting for me, now, to take the first
watch.
Mrs. P. (aside, viciously) —
Pve a small say, friend Johnny, in that.
(Exit Blacksmith and others. Johnny stoops
down to buckle his spur. Mrs. P. takes
advantage of his inattention, and reaching
down a certain decanter from the top shelf,
places it ready.)
Mrs. P. (softly)—Must you go, Jack 1
JohNNY (avoiding her eye)—
Yes, Polly, I’ve made up my mind.
This gambling and drinking’s all rot —
I’ve put in the peg.
Mrs. P. (crescendo) —Do you fancy I’m blind
Are you going to be married or what ?
Johnny (sullenly) —That’s about it.
Mrs. P. (filling him a glass from (he decanter,
and herself one from the brandy keg, he takes
it and prepares to drink) —
Well, Jack, it’s not worth while to scold,
Though I have been put down by a lass.
Well, here’s to the new love, and let’s drown the
old,
With a laugh for its requiem mass
(they both drink).
Johnny (shuddering and spitting on the floor) —
That whisky’s d d bad, I must go; well,
so’long.
Mrs. P. (coming from behind the bar and looking
into his eyes) —
Do you mind, Jack, our last year’s good-bye?
(Linking her arm in his and leading him off.)
Come into the parlour, I’ll sing you a song
For the last time; it’s no use to cry
Over milk that is spilt or a lover that’s false.
Johnny (putting his hand to his head and
staggering)
Sing, Polly, my head’s in a whirl.
Mrs. P.—
Here sit on this sofa, I’ll play you a waltz
While you dream of your down-country girl.
(Plays a few bars, then sings, mockingly, “ It’s well
to be off with the old love,” <&c., leaves off
abruptly and comes and hangs over the sofa.)
You’ll stay with me now, Jack, you don’t want
to go ?
Johnny ( hoarsely, striving to throw off the lethargy
caused by the drug) —
Yes, d n you, I must and I will.
Hi, Mick, where’s my horse?
Mrs. P. (caressing him) —Hush, Johnny, go slow ;
There, there now, keep quiet, you’re ill.
Johnny (fast losing consciousness) —
Oh, Poll . . didn’t think . . doctor . . grog !
(He sleeps.)
Mrs. P. (meditatively) —
How easily broke is man’s vow,
When a woman so wills it (to him.) Yes, lie like
a log;
Where’s your good resolution, gone now?
(Proceeds to turn out the sleeping man'spockets.)
What’s he worth ? Twenty, thirty, why forty odd
pound—
Oh, Johnny, you ought to know better
Than to carry that on you—now, this, I’ll be
bound,
Is his poor little sweetheart’s last letter.
By the writing, I take it she’s not long from
school.
(Skims the letter, reads the closing lines aloud.)
“It seems such a sad time to wait,
I pray for you often ” — (aside) —you poor little
fool,
“And Jack, darling Jack, do keep straight.”
Here’s her picture. Keep straight ! Would you
pray if you knew
Half as much as I do about Jack ?
Are you honest ? You look it — (bitterly)—so was
I ere I drew
That d d knave of hearts from the pack.
So you love him, well look at him—deaf, dumb,
and blind,
Mine, mine, I say, body and soul.
(Walks up and down the room, holding the money
and portrait in her hand.) s
Will your heart break, I wonder ? I have half a
mind,
(Pauses, looks at the picture, then thrusts it quickly
back in the sleeper's pocket.)
You can have him (looks at the money for some
time, finally thrusts it in beside the girl's
picture) without even toll.
(She throws a rug over the sleeping man, walks to
the back-door of the hotel, and calls the groom
from the stable.)
Ride down to the cattle-camp—take my bay
horse—
It’s somewhere near Henniker’s Ford,
And tell ’em they’d better come after their boss,
For he’s up here, as drunk as a lord.
(The groom docs her bidding, marvelling greatly
the while.)
L’Envoi.
No blade was e’er tempered, that might not be
gapped,
No metal e’er cast, but had some little flaw,
No halter e’er plaited, that might not be snapped,
No heart, but may somehow bo touched on the
raw.

toria may seem a gigantic undertaking to many,
but when one knows that every mob of cattle is
accompanied by several stockmen, a black boy, a
dray, or plenty of pack-horses, not forgetting a
cook to look after the creature comforts of the
men, while the route is along a well-beaten_ track,
such an affair is more like a prolonged picnic than
a wearisome journey. In the face of a mustering
and droving feat done by two men, L and
W , in the early days of the Palmer, the
droving of these times looks insignificant. At
that period cattle were worth from £l2 to ,£l5 per
head on the diggings, and the man who could
safely deliver a mob was certain to make a “ rise.”
This is what L and W were after,
and they saw their opportunity. All the property
they had in the world was a saddle-horse
and saddle and bridle apiece, but not a
cent of money. It was the middle of the
wet season when overseers and stockmen were
cowering in their huts, not caring to face the
pitiless rain and the no less pitiless bog. Anyone
who has been through a Northern wet season
knows what the ground is like after a few weeks’
rain : every step a horse takes puts him “knees
under.” Marsh flies and sand flies devour one in
the day-time, and mosquitoes at night. But L
and W were going for a “rise,” and a rise
they meant to make. Recollect there were but
two of them, without pack-horses or any means of
carrying food, except what they could stow on
their saddles, and they were actually destitute of
blankets. Dalgonelly Station, on the Flinders,
was GOO miles or more from their market (the
Palmer), but there were some nice bullocks on
Dalgonelly—just the ones to command a good
price. To Dalgonelly L and partner accord-
ingly went, mustered 60 head of fats, and drove
them the whole distance thence to the Palmer,
never losing a hoof and going, not along a
main road, but through the trackless bush. How
did they manage to live during the time ?
They ate the tails off the bullocks. They could
not afford to kill one, and had no salt to cure it
even had they done so. Unfortunately, their
pluck did not meet with its reward, but their
rascality did. They were annexed by the police
after they had sold the bullocks, but before they
got the money.
# # •
Many anecdotes are related of old
MTntyre, owner of Dalgonelly, who, having the
bump of locality but poorly developed, was notorious
for his bad bushmanship. He left home one
morning on a long journey, and during the day
his horse slewed round while old Mac. was deep
in thought, and took him right home again whe
he arrived about sundown. As Mao. rode un f 6
the homestead, he said to a man he met “r
thought there was something familiar about the 1
buildings.” ese
* * *
Mac. went down to be married once and
drove his wife back to the station in a bugm/
One evening he left Madame in charge of th
vehicle while he went off the road in search f
water—and got thoroughly bushed. His wif
passed a miserable night sitting in the buggy u. 8
mosquitoes eating slabs out of her, and liangi n Q
on to a pair of restless horses, who naturally wer*
indignant at not being let loose. Mac. returned
to the buggy at daylight after wandering abom
all night, and told his wife that she ought alwav”
light a fire when a man was away from camp at
night. Not long after this Mac. got lost on th
run, and as he did not turn up at night fiia
wife became very anxious, but, remembering her
instructions, put a lighted candle in every window
of the house, and caused numerous fires to be
lighted round about. At midnight Mac’s horsn
brought his tired rider within sight of the ill u .
ruinations. “ Big camp of niggers, by g llni I>i
muttered Mac. as he sneaked carefully away in an
opposite direction.
# * *
Mac aforesaid was an original old chap
his way. He once sent a mob of fats to the
Palmer in the charge of his overseer, who made a
very bad bargain with the butchers. Mac. heard
of this ere the overseer’s return and when the
culprit arrived was waiting for him on the
verandah with his cheque made up to date stuck
on the end of a pole thirty-feet long, which ho
poked at him in gloomy silence.
In Melbourne the other clay a man was
arrested in a hideous state of alcoholism and
remanded for three days for “ medical treatment.”
At the end of that period he came up again and
entered a powerful protest in court. He said
that he had got no medical treatment—some
coarse policeman had pumped water on him and
given him a big spoonful of salts, and that was all.
Justice travels fast in New Guinea. A
naked aboriginal over there committed, or was
alleged to have committed, a murder on Christmas
Eve; he was tried under a spreading tree on
Christmas morning, and hanged on a Xmas tree
the same day. This was the same offender who
according to the theory of Sir Samuel Griffith'
probably rather liked being hanged on account of
the scenery. As Griffith himself was part of the
scenery, he probably did.
Those who are inquisitive about what
“Rolf Boldrewood ” makes or ought to make
by his books may make a calculation for
themselves on the following basis. Accord-
ing to one of the best-known publishers,
300 copies of a three-volume novel, published
at 31s. (id., will about pay expenses. After
that profits commence. Of a six-shilling edition
—which means about 4s. Gd. cash, retail—OOOOcopies
must go off to clear cost. Now, Rolf’s “Robbery
Under Arms ” has already had a sale of 40,000,
and his other works have been in almost equal
demand. They are published nominally at 65.,
but the retail price now is 3s. At this sum, even,
the figures tot up handsomely. “ Robbery Under
Arms ” is the only one of his that was published
in 3-vol. form at 31s. Gd., and there can be no
doubt that at least 1000 were sold at that nrice.

Years Ago.
The old dead flowers of bygone summers,
The old sweet songs that are no more sung,
The rose-red dawns that were welcome comers
When you and I and the world were young,
Are lost, O love, to the light for ever,
And seen no more of the moon or sun,
For seas divide, and the seasons sever,
And twain are we that of old were one.
O fair lost love, when the ship went sailing
Across the seas in the years agone,
And seaward-set were the eyes unquailing,
And land ward-looking the faces wan
My heart went back as a dove goes homeward
With wings aweary to seek its nest,
While fierce sea-eagles are flying foamward
And storm-winds whiten the surge’s crest.
And far inland for a farewell pardon
Flew on and on, while the ship went South,
The rose was red in the red-rose garden,
And red the rose of your laughing mouth.
But no word came on the wind in token
-Of love that lasts till the end ; and so
My heart returned to me bruised and broken,
Frqju you, my love, of the long ago.
The green fields seemed in the distance growing
To silken squares on a weaver’s loom,
As oversea came the land wind blowing
The faint sweet scent of the clover bloom.
A rarer odour to me it carried,
In subtle delicate way to tell
Of you, ere you and the world were married—
The lilac-odour you loved so well.
Again, I saw you beneath the blooms of
Those lilac-trees in the garden old.
Ah me ! each tree is a mark for tombs of
Dead dreams and memories still and cold.
And Death comes there with his breath scent-laden,
And gath’ring gently the blossoms shed
(In guise of Autumn, the brown-browed maiden),
With your and my dead buries his dead.
O, fairer far than the fair ideal
Of him who imaged the foam-born Queen
In foam-white marble- a dream made real—
To me were you in those years, I ween.
Your lips were redder than night-shade berries
That burn in borders of hedgerowed lanes,
And sweeter far than the sweet wild cherries
The June sun flushes with crimson stains.
And gray your eyes as a cuckoo’s wings were—
A gray soft shadowing deeps profound.
Where thoughts that reached to the4ieart of things were,
And love lay dreaming though seeming drowmd.
Twin-tulip breasted like her the tread of
Whose feet made music in Paphos fair,
The world to me was not worth a thread of
Your brown, ambrosial, braided hair.
Mayhap you loved me at one time truly,
And I was jealous and you were proud,
But mine the love of the king in Thule,
Till death , and yours—sleeps well in shroud.
So night came down like a sombre raven,
And southward ever the ship sailed on,
Till glad green fields and lessening haven
Grew faint and faded like ghosts at dawn.
As fields of Heaven eternal blooming,
Those flowerful fields of my English land,
In midnight visions are still perfuming
All wild waste places and seas of sand.
And still in seasons of storm and thunder,
In strange lands under your land and mine ;
And though our ways have been wide asunder,
In calm and tempest and shade and shine,
Your face I see as I saw the last time—
As one borne space-ward on wings of light,
With eyes turned back to a sight of past time,
Beholds for ever that self-same sight.
But scorn has died on your lips, and through you
Shines out star bright an immortal grace,
As though God then to His heaven drew you,
And sent an angel to take your place.
I plucked one rose from the tree you cherished,
My heart's blood ebbing has kept it red,
And all my hopes with its scent have perished ;
Why mourn them now'—are Hie dead not dead ?
- And yet, God knows, as this rose I kiss, you
May feel the kisses across the sea ;
And soul to soul for the larger issue,
Your soul may stand with the soul of me,
Unknown to you for the strings of Being
Are not so easily snapped or torn ;
And we may journey with eyes unseeing
On paths that meet in the years unborn.
Farewell, dear love. Warm sighs may sever
Ripe lips of love like a rose-leaf curled.
But you remain unto me for ever
The one fair woman in all the world.
VICTOR J. DALEY.
* Two verses excepted, those little-known verses origin-
illy appeared, we believe, in the Sydney Mail.
The Age may eventually succeed in work-
ing the Melbourne people into a mild frenzy on
the gas monopoly question, but it will be a long
job, anyway. Besides, the gasmen attached to
that journal are not sufficiently 'em-lung with
their figures and comparisons. “In England,’
says the Age, “the usual system adopted is to
regulate the price of gas in the inverse ratio to the
dividends paid by the different companies.”
Why, the Melbourne Met. Go. makes a faint
pretence of doing that, and is by charter precluded
from paying its highest dividends when the article
Is at its highest price, otherwise the ghastly im-
position would produce 25 percent, as regular as
clockwork. The point to be insisted upon is that
no London gas company has for years past been
licensed to pay more t urn 10 per cent, to share
holders, and there the price of illumination is just
half as much as in Melbourne, where the
monopolists scorn the thought of a dividend under
2L per cent.
The U.S. Government paleontologist is
setting up his collection of gigantic fossil
mammals, birds and reptiles, some of which latter
run to 90ft. in length and must in life have
weighed 30 tons. The hypsirhopus was 30ft. long,
walked erect upon its hind legs and defended itself
by wagging its tail (armed with tremendous
spines) and grasped with its forearms. Its whole
body was sheathed in tremendous armour. Then
there was the agathaumas, whose skull was 25
feet long, and had a huge frill of solid bone six
feet in width extending backward from its head;
this being required for the attachment of tremen-
dous muscles necessary to hold up the skull. It
stood as high as a big elephant and was twice
as long. These two, however, were small com-
pared with the amazing amphicoelias, which was
15 feet high and 60 feet long, and weighed 20 tons.
Each of its footprints covered a square-yard. Its
remains are found where it got stuck in the mud,
which subsequently turned to stone and preserved
it. Put even it was diminutive compared with the
mighty atlantosaur, probably the biggest land-
animal that ever lived, with a thigh-bone eight feet
long. Ichthyosaurs grew to the length of 40 feet, and
had alligator-heads and huge eyes with which to
see into the water-abysses. In a mould made for
a cast of one 26 men comfortably sat down to
dinner. Not less weird than the landscape inthos 6
days must have been the aerial scene, the heaven 8
above the floods being filled with actual dragons
having a 25ft. spread.

The other night we turned up a speech by
Governor Loftus, in the Soudan time, in which
the old gentleman gushed over “ the happy time
he had spent in Australia.” Poor old fellow, he
had to do it! What his real feelings about Aus-
tralia were was shown by what he said to a Mel-
bourne Government official who offered him a
calf-bound copy of a State publication issued
under his (the official’s) supervision, and promised
to continue to forward it periodically to Europe.
“ My dear sir,” said the old gentleman bitterly,
“ I have been so unhappy in Australia that I hope
to forget it utterly. I don’t want your book, and
I do not mean to be rude when I say that I hope
never to see it, or anything else Australian again.”
Judging from current symptoms, the good-
hearted donkey who pays half his income to the
Melbourne weeklies for the insertion of a sermon
in each issue will draw upon the discourses of
Rev. John M'Neill for the material hitherto sup-
plied by Spurgeon. M‘Neill began life as a rail-
way-porter. He was once nominated for the
vacant pastorate in a fashionable Presbyterian
Church in a Melbourne suburb—but theportership
stuck in the gizzards of the congregation who had
made their money out of tallow and inflated land-
boom values. M‘Neill succeeded Oswald Dykes
at the wealthiest London chapel of the denomina-
tion —which would seem to show that the British
“ unco guid ” are not such snobs as their
“colonial ” brethren.
