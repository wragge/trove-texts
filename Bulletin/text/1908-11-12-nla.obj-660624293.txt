THE RED PAGE
The Australaise
There are exactly seventy-four national
poets in Australasia. This page has been
almost snowed under with patriotism. De-
spite the menace of our wrath, The Bulletin
has been staggering beneath a fusillade of
“Arises,” and “Awakes,” and “Advances,”
and quite a large thunderstorm of “Hails.”
As examples of the sort of thing we ex-
pressly did not desire, these may suffice :
AUSTRALIA.
Australia!
Who, in her virgin vesture,
Rose on the view of
England’s illustrious mariner;
Resplendent, as Venus
Risen from the sea :
And revealed herself—
Queen of the Isles ! ...
Garden of the gorgeous wild Waratah,
Gay with the plumage of Lory and Galah,
Gloryland—The Australian’s Beulah !
God’s Mizpah.
W. A. Grain.
GOD SAVE AUSTRALIA.
In darkest hour, when Monkey power
Shall threaten and assail ye,
When the White race shall feel disgrace,
God save Australia.
When our White land shall see a band
Of Mongol hordes who hail ye,
We them shall greet with our own Fleet
And free Australia.
O ! Native born with pride and scorn
Such “ Colored Brethren ” rail ye,
And be ye found true, staunch and sound
For White Australia.
Away your dolours ; while your colours
To the masthead ever nail ye,
And fight as one Australian son
For our Australia.
When Vict’ry’s won, Australia’s son !
May luck and fortune never fail ye ;
By your strong hand you freed the land
Of fair Australia.
God keep thee White by your own might,
Your emblem a white Dahlia !
And may there be Race purity
In loved Australia.
G.B.
Unevenness in quality spoiled many a
promising Australaise. Here are some good
stanzas, picked from songs of inferior make :
Till the last red drop be spilt
While we yet may hold a hilt,
We will guard our children’s right,
We will keep Australia white ;
-For when once the die is cast
’Tis Australia first and last
With us all.
Lillias Gordon.
Some day when our foes come surging
There will rise in our hearts a song,
Wild notes that will need no urging—
“ Australia right or wrong.”
Lausanne.
The deathless Right
Shall give us might,
And at the cannon’s mouth
We’ll raise again.
Above our slain,
A new blood-sacred South.
E. S. Emerson.
Though our country’s large, and our coastline
long, our people few, our defences small,
In valor and sentiment we are strong, with free-
dom we’ll live or with freedom fall.
We fought for our mother in lands afar, and died
like heroes at Mammon’s nod,
But fiercer we’ll fight in our country’s war, when
we fight for our homes, our land, our God.
Oscar Walters.
See, see the lusting challenge pressed—
Young lion hearts leap to the fray,
Hurl back the peril from our breast
As Austral cliffs the ocean spray.
Fight as our fathers fought the waste
Their children’s birthright to create.
Sons ! with their tameless spirit haste
To keen the home inviolate.
W.L.D.
David McKee Wright’s song is well
phrased, but lacks the fire, the frenzy of a
nation aroused and desperate. A verse for
sample :
Our fields are broad, our cities fair,
The stricken forest owns us king.
Shall the foeman spoil or share
All the richer years may bring?
By the pride of days to be
Reign or die in liberty !
On ! On ! On ! The homeland calling!
The harvest of our dreaming cannot waif !
On! On! On! With comrades falling,
A nation’s glory thunders at the gate !
0. C. Cabot has composed his “Battle-
Song” with care, making it simple, direct in
form and diction, and eminently “sing-
able ” ; but the trouble is the usual trouble
—he has used too much midnight oil and
gets too little flame.
What man will be backward—what man will show
fear ?
We want neither sluggard nor coward with us
here,
For here is stern work that the boldest will try —
Australia needs men who are ready to die !
Though clouded our sun and our star in eclipse—
Though battered our cities and shattered our
ships—
Grim hate in her glance and red blade in her
hand,
Alert and undaunted, Australia shall stand !
“ Kati Kati ” (M.L.) gets nearer ; but his
stirring invocation is spoilt by banalities like
We love thee, Australia, thy vast, fertile plains,
Thy mountains and rivers, thy gigantic trees.
He is argumentative rather than exhortative,
and in a battle-song no one wants to listen
to logic. Yet his beginning is stirring.
See where the flames fling their long arms of red !
List to the roar of the deep-throated guns !
Sisters are weeping for brave brothers dead,
Mothers are feeling death’s pangs in their sons.
Think not of wine ; red blood is flowing.
Think not of play ; war bugles are blowing.
Say “We are ready.” Shoulder the guns.
Australia is calling ; is calling her sons.
\!/
Most of the competitors, however, disre-
garded the conditions expressly laid down.
The song had to be a battle song—a song sung
after defeat or victory, an exhortation to our-
selves to conquer, not a song written in time
of peace and in the future tense. What was
needed was a song that, when the inevitable
war comes, will be sung to the marching of
our men to battle. Many excellent songs in
praise of Australia were submitted. It is
because they do not comply with these con-
ditions that the following songs are regret-
fully ruled out:
THE BOUNDING KANGAROO.
A wicked scratch in his wrath hath he,
Make room down here for the Kangaroo.
Keep peace for him in the Southern Sea,
Make room, good room, for the bounding ’Roo.
Room for the slide of the glancing keel
When the wide Pacific is breaking free
On the glittering walls of southern steel,
On the ships of Australia keeping the sea.
Room for the drifting smoke-rack skirling
Half of a week from Circular Quay,
Over the fringe of the spray-fog whirling
The fleet of Australia heating to sea.
Hush, when the welcome peace-guns boom •
And the squadrons of the white and free
Come over the rim and ask for room
From the keepers of the Southern Sea.
Room for the message of answering guns
When War is proclaiming her dreadful decree,
Make room for White Australia’s sons
When the fleet of Australia fights for the sea.
A wicked scratch in his wrath hath he,
Make room down here for the Kangaroo.
Keep peace for him in the Southern Sea
Make room, good room, for the bounding ’Roo.
Vic.
H. Tate.
THE SPIRIT OF AUSTRALIA.
The Spirit of Australia —it is strong and it is free,
It wings across the Continent from desert to the
sea,
Looks bravely at the future—it does not heed the
Past—
And takes the White Man’s Pennant and nails it
to the mast.
The Spirit of Australia —it shall drive against the
foe
When artillery is crashing and the fires of battle
glow;
On the Day of Mighty Reck’ning it will call its
children forth—
When the people of the Southlands meet the
hordes from out the North !
The Spirit of Australia, when the times of trouble
cease.
Will lead the nation wisely on the bounteous
paths of peace.
In the mining camp and city, on the back-plains
far away.
The Spirit of Australia is working night and day.
We have raised the White Man’s Banner —yea,
have raised it to the sky.
We have sworn to guard its honor, or, if has to
be, to die ;
So let every man be ready—let each father and
each son
Read the ominous wall-writings, and be ready with
his gun.
The Spirit of Australia— it is youthful, it is
strong;
And it kindles in the bosoms that have waited for
it long.
When there come the Days of Action, and the
Awful Nights of Dread,
The Spirit of Australia will be mighty at our head.
Vie.
Burnett Gray.
HAIL OUR AUSTRALIA!
LJa.il, our Australia !
Girt by the Sea,
Sons of the Summerland,
Brothers are we.
Ring out our battle-cry ;
March at its call :
“ Each for the Commonwealth,
God for us all! ”
Scions of doughty men—
Kings of the North—
Hither our fathers came
Valorous forth.
Under the cross of stars
Faction must fall,
Each for the Commonwealth,
God for us all !
Freedom’s full tidal wave
Onward shall roll,
Manhood, unmanacled,
Speed to its goal.
Never shall tyranny
Ho.d us in thrall,
Each for the Commonwealth,
God for us all!
Comrades, Australian !
Foemen of wrong !
Fending the feeble, fight:
Fight and be strong.
Shoulder to shoulder stand ;
Stand like a wall!
Each for the Commonwealth,
God for us all !
S.A.
G. F. Chinner.
WE HAVE NO SONG OF YESTERDAY.
We have no song of yesterday ;
The past to us is blank anU dumb;
Our glories have not passed away—
Our pride is set on things to come.
We have no hag with colors gay
Stained in the grip of pillaged lands ;
Our fortune lies within the clay
The future otters to our hands.
Wide is our land, from sea to sea,
Far-stretching, rich, and free, and fair;
Vast love alone can worthy be
Of the great greatness dormant here.
And here the soul of Nationhood
In slumber prisoned stirs to wake
The nation of our tiiew and blood
That you and I must help to make.
Oh, countrymen, let not your pride
Shrink from the boasts the o.>i lands own;
Our destiny is great and wide,
And rests upon ourselves alone.
Then with a will to dare and do,
From sloth the sword of action free;
Flaunt as a banner to their view
A Faith in what our land shall be.
That banner Freedom’s blessing hath ;
And whilst it leads the way ahead
Australia shall hew the path
On which the nations all shall tread ;
For aye the greatest is the last,
And as the nations stand to-day,
The stage is set with all the cast,
And waits tne Hero of the play !
Look up, look out, beyond our hour;
Behold our land as it’s to be ;
And gauge the dangers as they flower
On its emby.ro majesty.
Let patriot tire burn in your heart.
Its service with keen zeal to take.
Ours is a proud and noble part —
We have a nation yet to make.
N.S. W.
Hamer.
So we are left seven “possibles,” yet none
of these quite fulfils the desire of our Aus-
tralian heart. “ The Cross and the Great
White Star,” by “Gum-tree” (name and
address wanted), is “singable” and poetic,
yet scarcely vigorous enough. Stronger
passion is in the Battle Hymn of J. Alex.
Allan (Department of Agriculture, Melb.),
which, nowever, is somewhat too Kipling-
istic, and for song-purposes contains lines,
sucli as the third line from the last,
whose consonants and vowels clang horri-
bly, But it is a dignified and broadly
conceived thing. The prize of two guineas
is divided between these two competitors.
In a class of its own stands “ Den’s ” Blanky
Australaise. This is really the only satis-
factory battle-song submitted; and it is
quite Australian. It was submitted “not
for competition,” but it will win its way to
every heart in the back-blocks. And the
fact that it would go to the swing of the
“Merry Widow ” waltz will ensure its im-
mediate popularity. A special prize of one
guinea is accorded to the writer, A. J. Dennis
(Toolangi, via Yarra Glen, Vic.).
Other good Australaises will appear in the
future upon this page, and the writers (as
the writers of all complete songs quoted
herein) will be paid at the usual verse rates.
THE GROSS AND THE GREAT WHITE
STAR.
Red looming through the ocean haze
The Fagan sun-Jiag’s battle rays
Darken Australia’s sky ;
But her hills and her headlands hare flung afar
The flag of the Cross and the Great White Star,
And our hearts as the hearts of heroes are
—Now the women have said ‘‘'Good-bye.”
Where rifles ring, and cannon roar,
The blood-red sun-rays leap and soar
Against our Sacred Sign,
But the starry symbols of Lore and Grace,
The Great White Star of a tear-stained face,
And the lonely Cross of the great white race,
Brighter and brighter shine.
O mother—sweetheart—wife—and child—
Blue gullies— plains—and mountains wild—
* Your spirits understand
The thoughts that throng these life-long hours
With a fragrant pain of trampled flowers,
The passionate fire of love that is ours
For home and native land.
On — on —the heathen break and fly!
The white stars blaze along the sky
Above the sinking sun :
But the foe will again and again invade
This Holy Land of the last crusade,
Till the uttermost 'debt of blood be paid
And the strongest race has won.
True to our father’s high behest.
We guard the frontiers of the West,
From Asia’s infamy:
Through an Attila spring with his powers unknown,
At the Great Wh < «? Star, and the Great White
Throne,
We shall stand to our arms—if we stand alone,
Come death, or victory.
GUM-TREE.
AN AUSTRALIAN BATTLE-HYMN.
Men of an island set in foam.
Linked with a lesser isle,
Doth never a sea-wind blow you home
A threat from the Ajterwhile !
When over the brim of your belting seas
The lifting smoke-lines streak and show,
And the shouldering squadrons slay your peace,
Shall vour land lie stark to the rape of these
From the range to the reef below ?
Standby!
Braced feet, and the points laid low /
Got from the loins of a greyer land,
Son, ye are stripling grown,
Strong on your own set feet to stand,
Girt with a pride your own.
Shall the haft that your hard-strung fingers feel
Be the haft of the driving plough—no more ?
Ye have wrought your shares from the smitten steel,
So now for the sword and the shearing keel
Shall your fierce-lunged forges roai —
Who goes ?
Lo, a fleet and a foe off-shore !
Once in that gaunt, cold, greyer land,
Buckler and bow and bill
Twanged on the green in your great sire's hand.
So shall it serve you still
That his sport be yours—when the shrill shells dip.
And your russet cohorts leap crashing on,
And the wrestling bayonets drive and rip
For life and for land and a white wife’s lip —
Till the roar of the rout be gone,
( Strong hearts!)
And the victor have rest anon.
Watch, eyes, where your lazy vineyards shine,
And your white wives smile and weave,
Lest an Orient foot crush doivn your vine
And a Western robber reive !
So, grimed at your seawall's belching verge,
Shall ye thank God, peering the sick smoke through
From the shore and the wrack that your hot guns
purge
To the line where your swept foes melt and merge.
That your girdling chain strained true,
(God send !)
Whose links are the hearts of you.

America falls in line with Europe by estab-
lishing a national theatre. For the New
Theatre in New York a directorate has been
secured consisting of two theatrical managers
and a dramatic critic. The policy of the
New Theatre, whose existence was made
possible by a millionaire, is to produce mainly
the “classics/’ but its primary object is to
foster and exploit American playwriting. So
the American playwright has now his chance.
How much longer will the Australian’s chance
to production in Australia be barred by the
importing craze of” our few theatrical man-
agers ?

Bad Results of
Tram Accident.
The Case of Mrs. Mackie.
Nothing but good can result in giving to the
public some hint as to the various incidents in
which Mrs. Kate Mackie, of No. 2 Stanley-street,
WoolloomOSioo, once played a prominent part.
In beginning her story, Mrs. Mackie said :
“The ups and downs of life experienced by me
since arriving from Kilkenny, fifty years ago,
would make interesting reading, and I must say
that, taken altogether, I have a great deal to be
thankful for.”
“You have had your share of bad luck, as well
as good luck, like most people,” suggested the
pressman, who had called on a mission of enquiry.
“ Indeed, I have, and I consider the worst mis-
fortune that befel me was in connection with an
accident that happened two years ago, when I
was unfortunately the central figure. I intended
visiting Lavender Bay, and when I got as far as
Circular Quay in the tram, I was in the act of
alighting, when the car started off, and I was
thrown on to my face and hands on to the road.
A notable bump, such as I got, does not agree
with a woman well up in years, and my system
suffered severely from the terrible shock I received.
I was thrown out of gear altogether, and it looked
for some time as though the consequences were
going to be very serious, for I might have died.
My nerves were fairly broken up. To give you an
idea of the fright I received, I may tell you that I
have not been in a tram since. I have a positive
dread of them. I believe if I boarded one of them
now I would take a fit, my aversion is so strong.”
“ Perhaps you are still suffering from nervous-
ness ? ”
“Oh, don’t you believe it; for I was not long
in getting something that attended to my troubles
in respect to nerves, and I chanced to read of it
Clements Tonic—in the papers. The advertise-
ment I read appeared before me one day, like a
beacon acting as a guide to a mariner in distress.
The case fitted in with my own in some respects,
and something whispered to me that Clements
Tonic was what I required to put my system to-
gether again. And, believe me, sir, I was fear-
fully weak and ill, not a vestige of strength
remaining in my body. It must have been dread-
ful for other people to see me shaking like I did,
and I could not have written with a pen for any-
thing. But how wretched I was at night, not a
wink of sleep ever coming to my relief, while the
thoughts that ran through my brain were some-
thing horrible. The same round of things went
on from day to day—no appetite for breakfast,
dinner, or tea ; a head that felt like bursting with
aches from daylight till dark, and then on through
the night; when I stood up, a giddy feeling that
made things appear to be turning around in the
room ; terrible pains in the chest, and no life or
energy to help me withstand it—no wonder I felt
that I would rather be dead than alive.” >
“ Yes ; there is not much to live for when one’s
trials are so great.”
“And another thing I suffered from for years
was palpitation of the heart, and had tried nearly
every known medicine in the hope of getting
relief, but no—not till I bought some Clements
Tonic, and then I certainly did get something for
my money. And, oh ! what a joyful surprise it
was when I at length realised that my nervous
affections were commencing to subside, for the
possibility that threatened of being a confirmed
invalid for life became more remote as each bottle
of Clements Tonic was finished. The constant
twitching of the nerves at last gave way to a
steadiness that had hitherto been unknown to me,
and in every respect (in regard to my digestion,
especially) I was reaping benefit each day. 1
thanked God for my good fortune in coming into
contact with Clements Tonic, as it was undoubt-
edly the one remedy that saved me. My illness
had pulled me down a lot, but through sleeping
so soundly, and eating so well, under the influence
of my latest medicine, I picked up wonderfully,
and was soon as right as could be.”
“ This can be published, Mrs. Mackie ?”,
“ Yes ; in any form your mind suggests."’

" SCOTT’S Emulsion has put new
life into my son Sydney, aged 13. He
has always suffered with his throat and
chest, but since taking SCOTT’S his
cough has entirely gone, he has been
quite free from nasty chills, and looks
I had no difficulty in getting him to
take SCOTT’S and he is now quite
fond of it.” (Mrs.) M. GRANT,
43 Merriman Street, Millers Point, Sydney, N.S.W.
21/9/07.
Above is the Proof in the Facts.
Here is Proof in the Reason Why:
SCOTT’S Emulsion is so agreeable that
young people and all delicate palates quickly
grow very fond of it, and at the same time
SCOTT’S Emulsion has been proved by
actual experiment (conducted by medical
men) to be three times more curative, bulk
for bulk, than the plain oil. This is the
result of two causes :
1. The finest quality Lofoten cod liver
oil, of which SCOTT’S is always made.
2. The original perfected SCOTT
process which makes this finest oil perfectly
digestible and pleasant.
No other emulsion possesses these advan-
tages and this is why no other emulsion can
cure throat and chest weakness either so
surely or so fast as SCOTT’S. Therefore,
when purchasing, don’t ask for “ Emulsion
ask for and get
EMULSION
-the difference between them means a
cure for you !

VARIOUS VERSE
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The Bride’s Bouquet.
The church bells beat the scented air,
The groom rides forward unafraid,
The bride is tall and very fair,
A grave glows whitely in the shade.
White favors on his manly breast,
My bouquet in her lily hand,
The pair pass out. Behind the rest
In mute malevolence I stand.
My girl is there beneath the hill,
And deep and dark her beauty lies —
Oh, God, how swiftly love can kill!
And he rides off with laughing eyes.
He swore my sweet one’s soul away
With tender oaths, and she is there.
Across her mound he strode to-day,
Nor knew himself a murderer.
They told me he would wed with Rose.
I sought my darling’s grave so wide,
Whose flowers are like the drifted snows,
And sent a bouquet for the bride !

EDWARD DYSON.
A Song of Size.
His engine weighed
Just eighty tons.
(Blow for the crossing, blow !)
He swung his spade
On the long fast runs,
The smallest man
In the “firing-line”
Built on a plan
That was superfine—
He couldn’t have weighed
Scarce eight-stone-four;
But, sonny, he made
Her furnace roar,
(Blow, you Big Bull, blow !)
Day after day,
And year on year,
(Blow, if you want to, blow !)
He earned his pay,
And he earned his beer—
Great tons of coal
He scraped and threw
In the flaming hole
That the fierce draught blew.
If you guessed that he
Was twenty-four
Then you would be
Out a mile or more.
(Blow on the whistle, blow !)
“ When do you think
You’ll drive?” they said.
(Blow for the green light, blow 1)
Quoth he, with a wink,
“ Oh, when I’m dead.”
He looked so young
And he looked so small,
Yet his shovel he swung
The best of all.
He knew the road,
And he knew each grade,
And she hauled her load
By the fires he made
(Blow, all you big valves, blow!)
He asked for a change
To the hill or yard.
(Blow, you little-’uns, blow !)
They said, “ On the range
The firing’s hard,
And we want you here,
But, sure, some day—
Maybe in a year—
You’ll be moved away.”
Yet bigger men
Went driving first,
Again and again,
And his heart nigh burst.
(Blow on the sweet chime, blow !)
Out in the yard
They’d a bran new rig.
(Blow on the mountains, blow.)
Where the pulling was hard
She would make things jig.
But none of them knew
How to get the last
That she could do
From “Thunder-blast.”
Till one man said,
“ Better give her to Joe,
He’d make the dead
In their coffins go.”
(Blow very softly, blow.)
“Joe’s too small
And too dashed young.”
(Blow very gently, blow.)
“Yet he’s earned his call
By the coal he’s swung,
He knows a lot
And he’ll soon learn more.”
(If they’d only thought—
Joe was fifty-four.)
So they gave this job
To “ the engine-boy,”
Who smothered a sob
That was all pure joy.
(Blow, you Elephant, blow.)
His engine weighed
A hundred tons.
(Blow very loudly, blow.)
On the heavy grade
She blew great guns.
He looked like a stamp
On a kitchen stove,
But he made her tramp
Tig the hills above.
So he swells his chest,
And he earns his.beer,
The oldest, littlest
Engineer.

THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 12, 1908..
THE BLAMED FOOLISHNESS OF THE
WHOLE BUSINESS.
That the present methods of constituting: Ministerial
Cabinets, together with the powers exercised by these
bodies, amount in many respects to the usurpation of the
rights and duties of Parliament as a whole, tend to foment
unnecessary party strife, impede the work of legislation,
and precipitate artificial crises ; and, therefore, in the
opinion of this House, with a view to obviating these dis-
abilities Ministers should be elected by Parliament.
Proposition by Fowler, M.U.R. (of Westralva), on the
notice paper of the House of Representatives.
The machine has broken down again. Labor-
leader Fisher has given notice to the Dkakin
Government that his party “withdraws its sup-
port,” and when the prop is removed the roof
may come down at any time. There are at present
four parties in the Representatives—the Demo-
cratic and Protectionist party, which follows
Alfred Deakin, the Labor party, led by Fisher,
the Freetrade and wholly Tory party, which is led
by Reid when he happens to be there, and a Pro-
tectionist semi-Tory party, which is supposed to
follow Bigjohn Forrest more or less. Out of
these it is impossible to form a stable Ministry
according to the useless and antiquated method of
forming Ministries which this country imported
from England, save by the coalition of two parties
and a consequent sacrifice of principle by both.
The present Ministerial system only works when
there are but two parties —no more and no less.
The House of Reps, is not a two-party Parlia-
ment, and apparently it never will be again; in
fact, it isn’t in the nature of any honest Parlia-
ment to have just two sets of opinions on the
premises. Therefore the present Ministerial
system is a fraud and an unspeakable failure. It
has nothing to recommend it save that it is
English, and the Englishman himself doesn’t pro-
fess to see any special merit in it save that it has
suited his convenience. When it first developed
there were only two parties in the British Parlia-
ment, so there naturally arose a system adapted to
two parties. The British Parliamen t got beyond the
two-party stage at least 50 years ago, and the last
two elections have seen the return of jive parties
(the figures for 1906 were: 376 Liberals, 130
Tories, 83 Irish Nationalists, 54 Labor men, and
27 Liberal Unionists), but as one party or other
still, as a rule, has the lead of all the rest com-
bined, the two-party Government system still
works. When it ceases to work Britain will pro-
bably give it up. Meanwhile Australia sticks to
it—though here it is utterly unworkable—simply
because it is English. And England doesn’t thank
us in the least or think one whit the better of us
for sticking to it.
* * * •
The Deakin Government has got on precariously
for over three years in alliance with the Labor
party. Now the two bodies have split, and so far
as is known the split has happened over the question
of Federal control of industrial legislation. About
one-third of the House wants the Commonwealth to
have no control over industrial wages and hours
of labor; about a third wants it to have control in
the case of protected industries ; about one-third
wants it to have control in the case of all indus-
tries. Under the supremely loony policy which
lays it down that no Government must hold office
unless it can command a majority on every ques-
tion of importance, it is quite plain that, if
Parliament sticks to its honest beliefs,
this one question is calculated to wreck any
Ministry that can be formed. And so are a dozen
other questions. Things have reached a point at
which no Cabinet is possible for any length of
time unless it can find a sufficient number of liars
and turncoats to turn its minority into a majority
regardless of their real opinions. It is a most
unsatisfactory condition of affairs.
* * * *
Yet the proposition which has to be solved is
such an amazingly simple one that a way out
should be found in half-an-hour. Whether a
House contains two or five or 27 parties, there is a
definite majority one way or the other (even if it
is only arrived at by the Speaker’s casting vote)
on every question that can be laid before the
members. Even if the House was called upon to
vote on the question of complete control of in-
dustrial legislation by the Commonwealth, it
must vote “yes” or “no.” There may be three
parties on the question, but there are only two
ways of voting. Therefore, one might ask : Why
not simply let the majority decide every question,
and go straight on with business? To do that it
is only necessary to elect for the lifetime of each
Parliament a Premier and a certain number of
Ministers, supposed to be honest men and capable
administrators. As a rule, they would reflect, as
far as possible, the political views of the largest
party in the House, but that would be a mere
detail. They would have a policy, and would
lay their Biils before the House just as they do
now, but it would be understood that they were
not expected to take a violent huff and leave
office if the House rejected or amended their
measures or reversed their policy altogether.
There would no longer be an inducement to oppose
for the mere sake of opposition, for even if an op-
ponent secured the rejection of the Government’s
pet Bill he would thereby be no nearer putting
the Government out of office and putting himself
in. Motions of censure would be reduced to a
minimum because they wouldn’t lead to office ; an
individual Minister might occasionally have the
management of his department called in question,
but that would be all. Under such a system—the
one which works so smoothly in Switzerland—
Fisher and his party wouldn’t support Deakin
or refuse to continue supporting Deakin,
for both proceedings would be futile and meaning-
less. Deakin and his colleagues would simply be
in office because they had been elected for a three-
years’ term; and Fisher’s party, like every
other party, would be expected to vote on
the Deakin Government’s measures according
to its joint and several conscience. Its general
support would be of no use to Deakin so
far as keeping him in office was concerned,
and its want of support wouldn’t be of the slightest
interest to him. The time that is wasted over
crises, changes of Government, arrangements for
coalitions, arrangements for general support,
motions of censure, and the like, would be almost
entirely saved.
* - * *
The alternative is what the Tory dailies advise
the restoration, by a process of coalition, of the
useless two-party system, which is dead even in
England. The coalition idea is political lying,
dishonesty and stagnation condensed into one
word. It is Bent—just Bent. It means that
two parties agree to mutually sell their principles
for the sake of power. As each party agrees to
drop those items of its policy to which the other
party objects, so many things are dropped that
progress almost entirely ceases. Loafing, fraud,
dishonesty, incapacity and disgrace form the record
of practically every coalition Ministry that Aus-
tralia has ever possessed. And therein lies the
reason for the affection of the Tory press
for the present system of Party Govern-
ment. The Tory press loves stagnation, and
coalition means stagnation, and if it can per-
suade THE PEOPLE TO PRESERVE THE MISERABLE,
USELESS SYSTEM OF PARTY GOVERNMENT, IT WILL
make coalition inevitable. The worry and un-
certainty of trying to carry on in a three or four
party House, with a governmental system which
won’t fit the circumstances of the case, will bring
this result about. The men of honor and high
principle will retire rather than coalesce with
people whose politics they utterly detest; the
purely mercenary men will remain and sell the
country for office and boodle. Australia has such
a number of great and urgent things to do that it
can’t afford to have coalition and the peace that
means utter stagnation and Toryism, nor can it
afford to waste time making and unmaking weak
Democratic Ministries which, because of their
weakness, the result of lack of reliable support,
can do little when they are made. The system of
pulling down and rebuilding the whole domicile
every time some small item of the tenant s poli-
tical views don’t suit is too lingering and pro-
tracted. The Bulletin suggests that the two
Houses of the Australian Parliament should
straightway meet in joint sitting, and elect by
ballot a new Ministry to hold office for the term
of this Parliament whether its measures are
rejected or not, and should then get on with
public affairs. Public affairs are in a hurry.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Alleged Protestantism and the Australian
Capital.
That curiously foolish Sydney Yellow organ,
the Watchman, struck the pinnacle of lunacy last
week, when it dabbed a big notice on its contents
bill, “Rome’s Struggle for Dalgety. ihe
Watchman is the political pimp of anybody who
is rich and anti-Australian and parochial in senti-
ment, whether he is a Mohammedan or a Jesuit
or a Unitarian. It is, to all appearance, cheer-
fully willing to sell God or the Walls of Derry or
the Flames of Smithfield, or any other property,
to the crowd with the most local influence and the
most local money, no matter what that crowd
may be. Therefore the Watchman, being a Syd-
ney paper, and having an idea that T reetrade is
the best card to play in Sydney, is, and always
has been, rampantly Freetrade. Ihe Free trade
policy consists in refusing to protect the industries
of the workmen of Australia (who are less Gian ZZ
per cent. Roman Catholic) against those of I ranee
(almost wholly R.C.), Germany (about 35 per cent.
R.C.). Austria, Italy and Spain (almost entirely
R. 0.), Belgium and Holland (Roman Catholics
represent about 70 per cent, of the people),
Europe in general (Roman Catholics are to 1 ro-
testants nearly two to one), Canada, (about one-halt
R.C.) and Spanish America (about 60 Roman
Catholics to one Protestant). The Watchman,
being merely the serf or political flunkey of the
rich classes, whether Protestant or R.C., has
always whooped in the cause of the rich .N.o. W.
importer, whose policy it is to refuse anjy.preference
to the almost wholly Protestant Australian as
against the very largely Roman Catholic Euro-
pean. So long as the Watchman had a chance
to do the work of the local capitalist it apparently
didn’t really mind whether the local Protestant
workman starved or not. But in the matter of
the Federal capital the Dill Macky organ ex-
celled itself. The following (from the Seven
Colonies of Australasia. 1901-1902, page 838)
are the religious statistics of the Commonwealth
as shown at last census :
Per 1000 Population.
Roman Protestants,
Catholics. etc.
New South Wales .. .. 260 740
Queensland 246 <54
Westralia 234 766
Victoria 223 "
Tasmania 179
S. Australia US t .
In view of these facts one might have imagined
that a devoutly and violently Protestant paper,
purporting to be full of a desire to avoid allegedly
nefarious R.C. influences, would have desired to
keep the capital out of N.S.W. altogether it
being the State which is most conspicuously under
“Romish” influences. But the Watchman,
having really no religion except that of pandering
to the wealthy importers of Sydney (who are
to a considerable extent Roman Catholic, and who
live by depriving the mostly-Protestant Australian
workman of a job in order that they may make a
bigger profit by importing goods from mostly-
Catholic Europe), doesn’t take that view. Not
only does it demand that the Federal capital shall
be in N.S.W. (the most solidly Roman Catholic
of the Federated States), but it demands that it
shall be as close as possible to Sydney, where the
Cardinal hangs out, and where Roman Catholic
influence is strongest. Dalgety was recommended
as a Federal capital on its merits by reason of its
climate, fertility, scenery, water supply, water
power, convenience to a good port, and other
advantages. And it might have been recoin-
mended, if its advocates had felt like raising the
sectarian foolishness, on the ground that it, is
close to the strongly Protestant State of Victoria,
and a fair distance away from the great centres of
Roman Catholic influence in Sydney and Queens-
land. Its supporters didn’t raise the sectarian
question, but the Watchman did. That emi-
nently Protestant paper and all its followers—its
Wilks and Joe Cook and Bruce Smith and
Simon Fraser and the rest —ha,ve a curious desire
to plant the Federal capital in any kind of an
unsuitable spot, so long as it is as close as it can
possibly be dragged to the centre of the most.
Roman Catholic State of the Commonwealth, and
as close under the shadow of the Cardinal s palace
as circumstances will allow. Also the Watchman,
in its desire to deposit the capital right under the
shadow' of his Eminence’s palace, doesn t hesitate
to represent that there is a “ Romish conspiracy
to put it close to a strongly Protestant State. If the
Watchman were subsidised by the Pope it could
hardly be more remarkable than it is. The fact
that fc>iLL Macky has gone to Europe suggests a
horrible suspicion that he went to see the Pope
andarrange things with him.

That “ Generous ” Federal Capital Area.
The Sydney Telegraph is generally understood
to be to some extent the mouthpiece of the -lory
Government at Sydney, and is understood to
speak the views of that Government with the
authority of one possessing inside information.
Therefore it was interesting to read the following
in the ’Graph of 7th November
Yass Junction is situated at a point 187 miles from
Sydney, but the town of Yass is built three miles from
the Junction and reached by an up-to-date tramwayline.
EMBRACING AN AREA OF 144 SQUARE MILES, or
92 160 acres, the Federal capital territory includes the
whole of the parishes of Hume and Yass, &c.
So evidently the area of the Federal capital terri-
tory has been fixed, and the only possible theory
seems to be that Wade has fixed it all by himself,
and let the Telegraph know. The Australian Par-
liament didn’t know. N.S.W. didn t know, nor
did the other States. Australia in general was in
blank ignorance. And now the Sydney Tele-
graph comes out with the glad news that the area
of the Federal territory—if the capital is fixed at
Yassberra-is to be 92,160 acres. Brisbane and its
suburbs cover 195,200 acres; Melbourne and
suburbs. 163,480 acres; Adelaide and suburbs,
99 358 acres ; Sydney and suburbs 93,094 acres.
The information that some unknown person
(apparently Wade) has decided the area of the
Australian capital and the Federal territoiy sur-
rounding it at less than the size of Adelaide and
half the size of Brisbane, is cheering m a small way.

The Explanation of Senator Neild.
The warlike Neild stood up in the Senate the
other night, and made a curiously lame defence of
his share in the trickery which led, by many
devious paths, to the present situation as regards
the Australian capital. Said Neild:—
The Federation Enabling Act was passed in N.S.W. in
1895, and the Federal Convention was elected ui April,
1897. The second reading of the Federation Enabling
Act Amendment Bill was moved in October, 1897..• ••
When the Federation Enabling Act was passed in JN.h. w.
in 1895 there were 240,000 electors on the roll. But two
vears later, when I moved the second reading of my Bill,
the number of electors had risen to 300,000, owing to
greater facilities for enrolment and voting as the conse-
quence of Government legislation. .. . There being this
very large increase in the number of electors in N.&. w.
it was right and proper that the minimum affirmative
vote of 50,000 should be raised in order that the verdict
might be a valid one.
It sounds very plausible when put that way, but
on closer inspection the mantle of plausibility
Droves to have huge holes in it, ana the dirty
transaction shows "through. According to ™? e
N.S.W. Statistical Register for 1906 (page bU7),
in 1895 there were 267,458 voters on theJN.S. W.
roll not 240,000 as Neild alleges. The volume
gives no figures for 1897, but the 1895 figures con-
tradict Neild flatly. Then, even if Neild s
figures had been correct in both cases, the increase
from a required minimum of 50,000 votes out of
240,000 on the roll (rather over 20 per cent.)
to a required minimum of 80,000 out of 300,000
(a good deal over 26 per cent.) was not an in-
crease based on or caused by an increase in
the number of electors, but sheer political
swindle and breach of faith.. Yet even
that was not the worst of the case. When N.S.W.
invited the other States to join it m a federa-
tion, the N.S.W. Government and Parliament
promised that the Federal Constitution would
be carried in their State if it received a majority
of votes, and provided the affirmative vote was at
least 50,000 strong—so,ooo out of a population
of 1,277,870. The other States went into the
movement on that promise and agreement; but
two years later the N.S.W. Parliament at the
instance of warrior Neild, and helped by Premier
Reid, who refused to make the keeping of his
agreement a Government question, Broke faith,
and raised the required minimum to 80,0UU—
-80,000 out of a population of 1,323,460. It was
such a huge enlargement of the proportion ot
votes required both as compared with population
and as compared with the number of voters on
the roll, that it is shameless effrontery to say
that the change was caused by either increase ot
population or increase of voters. 1 lie deed was
done simply to secure the rejection of the Constitu-
tion in order that the N.S.W. Government might
squeeze the other States for special concessions,
which the other States would probably grant
rather than see all the work they had done at
N.S.W.’s invitation go to waste. The first Con-
stitution, which left the location of the capital an
open question, was accepted by the people ot
N S.W. according to the honest agreement made
with the other States, and rejected according to
the political swindle fathered by Senator Neild.
Then the possession of the capital was assured to
N.S.W. and there was another referendum ; but
this time, by way of making the paltry self-seeking
of the whole business all the more glaring, there
was no minimum at all. The N.S.W. Parliament
so carefully loaded the dice that the Constitu-
tion which gave all the States a chance ot
the capital would have been legally rejected
in N.S.W., even if 79,999 people voted for it
and only one against it. And on the other hand,
the Constitution which assured N.S.W. ot tne
capital and disqualified all the other States, would
have been legally accepted in N.S.W. if only ten
people had voted for it, and nine against it. All
the hollow pretence about the anxiety to make
the verdict a valid one disappears right there, it
was a poor dirty little series of political tricks, and
the sort of thing that “ an officer and a gentleman
should have tried not to be mixed up in. N.S.W.
would almost certainly have had the capital in
any case, but the wretched process of marking
the cards, which its Legislature adopted to make
dead sure, was a business only worthy of the two-
up profession.
The Noise at Broken Hill.
There has been a tremendous lot of fuss and noise
at Broken Hill about very little-a tremendous lot
of howling before anybody has been hurt, fuere
was really no need for any excitement at all, and
probably there wouldn’t have been any, if JOHN
Darling, chairman of the Broken Hill Prop., had
2gr. of sense. That absurdly puffed-up person
some weeks ago declared that there would have to
be a reduction of wages at the Broken Hill mines.
Instantly the fat was in the fire—and the Tnter-
national Socialists,” or “Groupists, made it
a very hot fire. The Broken Hill cos. had just
been having a particularly gaudy time. I here
had been a metal boom, and with lead at a pre-
viously-unheard-of price, the profits of a tew
of the cos. had been gorgeous. Using these
gorgeous profits as a text, the “Internationals,
or ‘‘Workers of the World,” made considerable
headway, and collared command of the unions
an easy enough thing for a solid, energetic little
band to do temporarily at most times. lor se\ eral
vears past work at the mines had been carried on
on an agreement made under the Arbitration law.
Two years ago, at almost the top of the lead boom,
the last agreement was made ; it embodied a rise
of about 121 per cent, in wages, and ran to the end
of December, 1908. For the worst-paid labor the
wages had before that time been wretched,
considering all the circumstances; and the
men had made tip their minds that,
when the time came to reconsider the
agreement, they would fight hard against any
reduction. When John Darling, chairman and
champion blunderer, announced that there would
have to be a reduction, the men naturally con-
cluded that a conference with the .owners was
hopeless—that on the one point on which they had
made up their minds the owners had made up
Their minds too. They saw nothing for it there-
fore but a fight to a finish through a strike or a
lockout. So they began to prepare. IhiDugh
the influence of the “ Internationals, Tom Mann
was hired as organiser. And Tom Mann bega
to talk the usual chain-clanking nonsense. lhe
citv worker is used to that sort of hifalutin,
he his heard it often in the Domain and
on the Yarra Bank, and he knows it is
merely hot air. Unfortunately, the Broken Hill
unions seem to have thought it was Quite the
right way to talk, and responsible union officers
used the same sort of wild language m their
speeches and manifestoes. Wades reply was a
consignment of 50 police-a perfectly proper
reply g if the wild language had its ordinary mean
ins • but it hadn’t—these men no more meant
actually what they said than the Salv army person
means what he sals about his frightfull PJ* when
he is giving his “testimony. fortunately,
however there are doers on both sides as well a.
the merespouters of whom the public hears mos ,
consTquentlv, the preliminaries for a conference
between managers and miners go on uncheckiid ,
•u,d there is very good reason to believe tnat, u
t d tin parties are left to themselves, the busi-
«ss Willie fi?ed"p all right. It doesn’tpatter
to the peripatetic T. MaNN, of course, but the
miners are quite as interested as the managers in


fixing a scale of wages which will allow of the
mines being kept at work. Already three mines
are wholly or mostly closed down, and the
miners, with that fact before them, know quite as
well as the managers that it is no good to them to
fix wages at 10s. a day if nobody gets the 10s.

White Atherton and, Incidentally, the Need
for an Australian Fleet.
Atherton, in North Queensland, was reported,
last week, as having broken loose to some
extent. Atherton stands on a great table-
land where the climate is Heaven and the
soil is as fertile as the flower-beds of Paradise.
But the leering, insanitary Chow has a lien on
Atherton, and the innumerableness of him and
his joss has got on the white men’s nerves. So
the white men started a movement of protest, and
a circumstantial tale came south about how the
protest had broken loose and run riot, and about
the burning of Chinese humpies and the kick-
ing of joss into the middle of next week. The
news was contradicted, but if it isn’t true
this week it may easily be true next week
or the one after. It is difficult for the
people of the south country to understand the
intensity of northern feeling on the subject of the
Chinaman, or to realise how well the northerner
does to be angry. Theoretically the Chinese
population of Australia is decreasing, for the
known departures exceed the known arrivals.
Theoretically there are large, splendid, capacious
laws to keep the Chow out. Theoretically the Chow
is kept. Out, But all the time he is coming in.
The northerner knows this, for he keeps count.
He sees two pigtails where there used to be one
tail ; and three Chinese humpies where there used
to be one humpy ; and four josses where one joss
used to be. Atherton alone has reckoned the
influx of strange Chows who speak no English at
18 or 20 per week. And because the law does
nothing to repair the evil, the white man has
begun, rs was inevitable in such circumstances,
to be a law unto himself. It is here that the
accursed and unspeakable folly of Australia’s
neglect to build a war fleet of its own comes'in.
The purpose above all others for which Australia
requires a fleet in peace time is to patrol the
northern coasts and keep out the smuggled Asiatic
and his goods. The hired squadron (over which
we have no control) utterly neglects this work,
and the Jap and the Chow can land on
the lone north coast as they darned well
please. For want of a fleet of our own
the Asiatic multiplies up north, and because
of his multiplication there will almost cer-
tainly one day be riot and murder and incen-
diarism and hangings and foreign complications
of the worst sort. The only possible remedy is
the swift acquisition of an Australian navy which
will incessantly patrol the northern seas, and re-
move the cause of the trouble. If that isn’t done,
the anger of a justly incensed people will assuredly
lead to reckless doings, and the bill that Australia
may have to pay to some foreign Power for insult
and injury may cost about as much as the navy
would have cost.
The Tariff as a Strike-Fomenter.
The S. M. Herald, in an article under the head-
ing “The Industrial Unrest,” provided (9/11/’08)
a weird explanation of the strikes that have been
occurring in N.S.W. during the past couple of
months. An extract:—
There are some fairly obvious reasons why the working
classes should be in a somewhat discontented frame of
mind. As the result of the recently-imposed tariff the
cost of living has of late been very appreciably increased.
That the worker does not wholly appreciate the factors
that have had so material an effect upon his comfort we
are quite prepared to learn, etc., etc.
The Herald has accused Protection of a good
many things in its time, but the charge of strike-
fomenting is new. The argument in sup-
port of the accusation is interesting by reason of
its audacious novelty. In the Herald’s view,
the purchasing power of the sovereign has so
wilted under Federation that the working-man
owner of the coin has been rendered desperate.
An unreasoning, clod-likej person is the N.S.W.
worker, according to the Herald. He takes out
his sovereign, gazes at it dully and goes forth to
buy sustenance for himself. Lo f the golden piece
turns out to have shrunk in value, owing to the
tariff, by 3s. or ss. or 10s., as the imagination of
the Freetrade writer may suggest. So the worker
dashes his hat violently to the ground, and in a
state of stupefied disappointment goes on strike.
There are flaws in the Herald’s proposition; in
fact, it is not too much to say there are gaping
cavities in it. The main cavity is that it is an
obvious and glaring lie. Things have improved
so much for the workman under Protection that in
theN.S. W. Savings Banks —thebanksof the poor—
the savings on 30th June, 1908, represented £ll ss.
7d. per inhabitant, while in 1900, the last year of
Separatism and the Herald’s bogus “Free-
trade,” they only represented £7 19s. 9d. The
worker had nearly £11,000,000 saved up on 31st
December, 1900, after taking the S. M. Herald’s
advice for 09 years. At 30th June last he had
neglected the Herald's advice for about seven
years, and he had nearly £18,000,000 in the
bank—his savings had nearly doubled. Either
living is a great deal cheaper under Protection
than it was under the silly old paper’s sham Free-
trade, or else wages are a great deal higher ; any-
how, the worker has a far larger surplus left after
paying for his maintenance than he had in the
days when he was foolish enough to follow the
advice of the Herald. But it isn’t so in
all countries. In the United Kingdom, which
is the only civilised country of importance
that spurns Protection, the worker has good
cause to be sad, and “industrial unrest” is
a mild term for the state of affairs that exists.
The average worker there does not talk in terms
of sovereigns. He rarely sees one. Twelve
millions of him are struggling, and for the most
part failing, to earn from 7s. to 10s. per week. And
such of him as has a job is striking and being
locked out (a Reuter’s message in the same issue
of the Herald that talks of industrial unrest in
N. S. W. mentions the conclusion of the cotton lock-
out, which is alleged to have cost £7,000,000) as
freely as the workers in any other part of the world.
Fiscalism has no more relation to the discontent
that has made itself manifest among N.S.W.
workers of late than has Parkes’ deceased Kiama
Ghost. The N.S.W. worker has lost an Arbitra-
tion Act that, with all its faults, was a good
Act, and has got in exchange an Industrial
Disputes Act that is, as it stands, a pre-
posterous piece of legislation. Apart from the
grotesquely-complicated machinery provisions of
the Bill, and the hopeless delays that are neces-
sarily occurring in the formation of Wages
Boards, there outstands the valid unionist griev-
ance that non-unionists—who are always un-
financial in the union sense—may vote under
Wade’s new measure in the election of
Boards, though they have no sort of interest in
the Act nor liability under it, and though un-
financial unionists may not vote. In other re-
spects, the N.S.W. unionist who has borne, and
still bears, the brunt of the struggle for decent
wages and living conditions, has cause to resent
the WADE-ite policy of pandering at his expense to
the “scab,” who fears to fight, yet hurries gleefully
forward when the fight is won to reap the spoils
thereof. That the unionist is ill-advised
often enough in the form of his protest against
the inequity and maladroitness of Wade’s ad-
ministration is neither here nor there. Remains
the fact that he is not half-witted, and that he is
not creating industrial trouble out of a wild (albeit
unconscious) hankering for Free trade of the British
pattern.
The Mount Morgan Sepulchre.
Two months ago seven miners were killed under
a huge fall of stone in the Mount Morgan mine,
in Queensland, and a week ago five more were
crushed to death in the same way, and many
more dodged falling earth and flying rock and
escaped by the skin of their teeth. Be-
tween times there have been other falls,
and before the big smash that killed the seven
men there had been other smashes with, fortu-
nately, nobody underneath them. Even, how-
ever, if there had been no accidents that might
have been disastrous if goodluckhadn’tintervened,
twelve corpses in two months constitute of them-
selves a butcher’s bill which the most confirmed divi-
dend-grabber would hardly dare to justify. Yet it
can’t he too plainly stated that it was merely to
add an extra penny or so to the quarterly divi-
dend that the present system of working Mount
Morgan was adopted; and the adoption of a rea-
sonably safe system would not cut more than a
penny or so off the quarterly dividend. When
the vast gold-copper deposit came to be worked it
was decided to take the body out in two great
underground quarries, each GOft. wide. These
two underground quarries are merely divided by
an irregular and often rotten dolorite dyke, or
natural wall, about 20ft. wide. They are 10ft. high ;
and as the ore is blasted away from the face about
one-third of it is removed, while the other-
two-thirds is shovelled back, and is used as a plat-
form on which the men stand and blast down more
ore. Presently the two-thirds is removed, and
another 10ft. is cut away from above, and the
broken ore underfoot is replaced by mullock. So
it may happen that there may be a space 20ft.
high between the floor and the unsup-
ported roof. Ordinarily, of course, there is
less; but between the time when the broken ore
is taken out and the mullock is put in there is an
interval during which there is this lofty sepulchre,
whose roof rests on nothing whatever. In the
Kimberley diamond mines this same plan is
adopted. It is true that it kills many men
there, but as they are black not much
fuss is made about it. Probably that misled
the people who adopted it at Mount Morgan—
had there been a row about it in S’Africa they
might have shied off a system which undoubtedly
gives every mining man who looks at it a feeling
that the lives of the men are being risked in the
struggle to save a few sticks of timber. And at
Mount Morgan the risk is all the greater because
the greasy face of the dyke is irregular, and some-
times inclines in towards the chamber ; when that
happens there is a treacherous mass of practically
unsupported ore overhanging the men working in
the chamber. Where there is any evident danger,
temporary props are, of course, put in; but it is
not possible to effectively prop the roof of
a sepulchre GOft. wide, and, anyhow, with
this system of working there must be
some parts of the roof, as explained just
now, which have no support at all. More-
over, with the roof so high, it isn’t possible to
sound it; and even if the roof could be sounded,
the weak joint or floor would probably be too far
up in the rock to give the warning “drummy”
echo. When a cavern is blasted out underground,
the tendency necessarily is for the roof to cave
in ; the prudent engineer, therefore, leaves only
a small part of the roof unsupported at any time.
When a big expanse is left unsupported, natural
forces get out of hand, and once they get
out of hand—as when 15,000 tons come thundering
down at once—no ordinary bit of timbering can
stand against the shook. The Mount Morgan
people—or some of them—never have denied that
the system looked unsafe ; but they said it wasn’t
what it looked. Twelve corpses in two months
are ghastly proof that the system is all
that it looked. And it is doubtful
whether any small modification of it will
make it safe. The chances are that it will have
to be rooted out and an entirely new system of
timbering and mullockingadopted. Fortunately,
the mine can stand the expense easily; for it
wasn’t because it is a small and mean mine,
but because it is a gigantic one, that this
big, cheap, wholesale system was introduced. Yet
if it couldn’t stand the expense of close timbering,
the present system would have to go—even if
Mount Morgan had to go with it; for Queensland
hasn’t so many men that it can afford the sacri-
fice of half-a-dozen a month in the quite unneces-
sary work of digging up gold and copper.

The N.S.W. Labor Party and its Lost
Opportunities.
James McGowen, Leader of the N.S.W. Labor
Opposition, has a capacity for the inopportune
which amounts to genius and a way of missing the
’bus that deserves public recognition—a large oil-
painting of the lost ’bus would be about the right
thing. There is little doubt that it would be good
for the State to give McGowen a trial as Premier.
He has had long Parliamentary experience; he has
the reputation of being level-headed and honest,
even though he is slow and pitiably narrow ; and
anyhow it is up to the State to try somebody apart
from the weary old gang in office. But McGowen,
the confirmed ’bus-loser, never gives himself or his
party or his well-wishers a chance. When he
moves a vote of censure it is always on some ques-
tion whereon he is dead sure to get the support of
his own party alone, and of not a man outside it,
and he knows perfectly well that his own party
isn’t strong enough by itself to put him into power.
His attitude last week was wholly justifiable.
He has never been an Opposition-leader like
Reid, who used to bring forward a censure motion
every month ; and on the rare occasion when
McGowen challenged the Ministry he had a right
to expect the ordinary courtesy that is given to a
man in his position. The ordinary courtesy is a
foolish, time-wasting method, but if Premier
Wade wants to save time he should arrange with
the Leader of the Opposition for the establish-
ment of a new system which won’t waste so much
time. Instead of this, Wade, who has certainly
quite as much politeness as a hyena, if not more,
and who has never been accused of being behind
the peccary in the small refinements of debate,
took up the attitude of a potentate who refused
to recognise the existence of an Opposition
or an Opposition leader, and the Opposition
left the House by way of protest. But
apart from these side issues, the aggravating
circumstance is that the Opposition hasn’t a
chance or a hope. As usual, it has attacked the
Government openly, honestly and blunderingly
on a question whereon it won’t command a vote
outside its own minority. There are questions
whereon—if it could persuade the country that it
'•' Was in real earnest, and at this late hour that might
be hard to do—it could probably command enough
outside support to make it a majority, and give it
a chance of securing office, and when it had got
office it might easily, by good administration, in-
spire such confidence that it would acquire a per-
manent majority, but on these questions
McGowen, the ’hus-loser, always sides with
Wade. Wade’s borrowing policy, Wade’s reck-
less expenditure, Wade’s savagely anti-Federal
and anti-Australian attitude, Wade’s craving to
plant the Australian capital where its growth will
help to further congest the already most-congested
portion of Australia, Wade’s coarse and brutal
incivility to the only really and wholly
democratic Parliament in Australia—these are
the points on which the chronic ’bus-
loser throws aways his chances. If he and
his party had years ago become bitterly,
consistently and trenchantly anti-CARRUTHERS
and anti-WADE on the questions above enumer-
ated it would have gathered to itself the anti-
borrowing and anti-parochial and pro-Australian
elements, and it would almost certainly be in
office to-day. Then instead of wailing impotently
about Wade’s refusal to give preference to
unionists and his destruction of the old sensible
Arbitration Act, and his Broken Hill coercion
policy, it could have managed these matters itself.
The party’s abject subservience to Wade on every
subject that gives it a chance or a hope of unseat-
ing that person, and its habit of never revolting
except when it hasn’t the ghost of a chance and
when Wade can throw clods at it with impunity,
is worse than lamentable. It has consistently
sacrificed the interests of its party—
(l) For the sake of the loan policy, the policy of extra-
vagance, and the bogus sinking fund policy.
(2) For the sake of helping to throw dirt at the most
democratic Parliament in Australia.
(3) For the sake (in the matter of the Federal capital)
of th« policy of Congestion of Population.
(4) For the sake of the big landlords of N.S.W., Wade’s
demand for a very small Federal capital territory is based
on the idea that the land values created by the expendi-
ture of the money of all Australia on the building of a
capital should extend over into adjacent N.S.W. terri-
tory and be mopped up by the N.S.W. private landlord.
And there, apparently, McGowen is with him.
For the sake of these things the N.S.W. Labor
party places itself in such a position of weakness
and impotence that when an urgent Labor ques-
tion turns up Gregory Wade is in a position to
wipe his feet on it." And Wade wipes accordingly.
Wade is a habitual wiper. James McGowen is
an honest politician according to his lights, but he
hasn’t enough lights. He believes honestly in
looking after the best interests of N.S.W. and
Australia, but to him N.S.W. and Australia are
Sydney, and principally Redfern. He has no
Australian views; his outlook is hopelessly nar-
row ; and he is a Heaven-sent loser of the ’bus.
Socialism in a New Place.
One “Chemist,” in the Sydney Telegraph
(3/11/’08), identified Socialism as lurking hideously
in the N.S.W. Pure Food Bill. He urged that
the microbe should be routed out of the Bill and
placed on a perfectly flat surface, and then hit a
squashing blow with some object of weight. The
Socialism which makes “Chemist” shudder is
the proposal that the Board of Health shall “have
power to determine whether drugs and foods
are correctly advertised.” The result of this,
“ Chemist” foresees, will be that
the Board of Health, with the approval of the Minister,
will proceed to publish their conclusions, and destroy
whatever enterprise they think should be destroyed
Is this not the union label over again; Protection,
Socialism in the most rampant form ? ... To make this
the law would ruin the proprietary medicine business.
It interferes unjustly with the liberty of the manufactur-
ing chemist. This particular section of the Bill should
be omitted.
Also he talks of “ British justice being ignored,”
“hole and corner business,” “contrary to the
spirit of the British Constitution,” “Pharaoh,”
“relentless tyranny,” and “the ruin of honest,
reputable traders.” It is a hrige disturbance foi
an honest, reputable trader,’ with a clear con-
science about his goods, to create. If the Pure
Food Act passes in an unmutilated form it will be
one of the duties of the Board of Health to analyse
from time to time the various proprietary medi-
cines. The Board of Health—the majority of whose
members are experts in these matters —will decide
whether the articles examined are “dangerous or
injurious to health,” and whether they are,
approximately, worth the price asked for them.
Unquestionably this is a manifestation of Social-
ism, just like milk inspection and the various
tyrannous regulations against the vending of
tuberculous meat, and the relentless war the law
wages on gold-brick merchants. But it is none
the less equitable. As things are the public is
swindled flagrantly by certain vendors of pro-
prietary medicines. Also the public’s health
is injured by these medicines, and occasion-
ally its moral character suffers. ‘ 4 Peruna, ” which
is one of the most popular of the proprietary
medicines, costs ss. a bottle. Jones, M.L.A.,
elicited last year from the N.S.W. Colonial Secre-
tary that “ Peruna ”, contains 19'85 per cent, of
alcohol (which is equal to 40 per cent, of proof
spirit), •24 per cent, of cubebs, and 79'91 percent,
of water. Its value per bottle is'about 3d. In
fact, it is a hideously expensive and evil intoxi-
cant. And there are lots more like “Peruna.”
Proprietary medicines may, in score of cases, be
beneficial to health, and worth the money asked
for them. The owners of these will have no cause
to fear anything from the experts who will sit in
judgment at the Board of Health. The only
people who will suffer are those who
vend medicinal “ fakes,” disguised fire-
waters and so on, at preposterous figures.
Socialism will smite these wrong-doers hard, and
they will not get up again. And though anti-
Socialistic chemists and the proprietors and im-
porters of patent medicines may rave helplessly of
“persecution” and the “downfall of freedom,”
and the “ removal of liberty from the subject,” the
public will view their anguish unmoved; and if
the public comments on the painful spectacle at
all it will merely be to note that Socialism in this
regard is, after all, but another name for the
prevention of the evil practice of getting money
by false pretences.

A Birthrate Item.
“Henry Horsecollar” writes: —Certain recently-
issued figures as to the ages at which people of
various occupations marry emphasises a fact which
has been often mentioned before —that it is the
poor who keep up the frequently-mentioned birth-
rate, and that it is the affluent who keep it down.
For instance, it is shown that the Victorian iron-
worker marries on an average five years earlier
than the commercial bagman, the doctor, lawyer,
civil servant and so on —in fact, nearly all the men
who represent hard manual hustle marry young,
and nearly all the other kind of men postpone the
responsibility. Therefore the brawny toiler has,
as a general thing, a couple of children when he
reaches the age at which the man who toils
by means of a sample case or a brass plate
with “M.D.” on it is only beginning to
think of wedlock. As a result of this
tendency, the birth-rate in working-men’s dis-
tricts is high, while in high-toned suburbs it
is astonishingly low. For instance, in the month
of September (for which statistics are just to
hand) the birth-rate at Newtown (Sydney) was at
the rate of nearly 36 per 1000 per annum ; in
Erskineville it was at the rate of nearly 30 per
1000 per annum ; at St. Peters it was nearly 36 ;
at Botany it was 44 ; ?tnd there were other exam-
ples. And at the other end of the list, at Vau-
cluse the birth-rate was nil; at Lane Cove it was
at the rate of under four births per 1000
inhabitants per annum ; at Burwood it was less
than six; and at Hunter’s Hill about 17.
It is to the gorgeous mansion with all the luxuries
of civilisation—billiard-room and library, hot and
cold water laid on, conservatory, smoking-
room, drinking-room, and cursing apartment
(at least if civilisation doesn’t include
these two last it ought to) —that the stork
comes rarely, and is none too welcome when
it does put its beak in at the window.
On the other hand, where the home is partly log
and partly hessian and partly galvanised iron, the
bird arrives numerously, and though there isn’t
much to give it, it is mostly well received. It
seems to be the same in all countries. The U.S.
millionaire, whose son is a degenerate of the
Thaw description, doing a life sentence in 13
luxurious cells and expecting to buy his release at
any moment, and whose daughter is the childless
wife of the Prince de Blanky, whom she has pur-
chased, alqng with his battered Italian castle,
with an allowance of 50,000 dollars per an., has
become a bye-word by reason of the way his
family dies out. In fact, the U.S. birthrate seems
to be almost extinct now save on the small
farms and in the tenement houses.
c
Johnson and the “ S. M. Herald.”
Consider the lamentation of S. M. Herald’s
“ On the Land ” column (5/11/’08) concerning the
alleged chronic truck-shortage on N.S.W. rail-
ways :
At present, commonsense methods appear to be over-
whelmed by traditional red-tape circumlocution. Exam-
ples of this reported from country centres, if correct,
indicate that it is quite time a practical man was given
full authority to control the handling of stock trains and
the transit of stock. When owners who wish to shift their
stock, but were unable to obtain trucks, are said to have
had to stand by and watch a train of empty trucks leave
their station, practical business management appears
necessary. If such cases do exist, surely steps could be
taken to utilise the telegraph wires and some intelligence.
. . . Not only are the stock going to Victorian towns to be
reckoned as a loss for the most part, but also those con-
signed to Albury, Moama and Deniliquin. They are all
on their way to Victoria, whereas with proper railway
management a great percentage at least WOULD BE
COMING TO SYDNEY.
Alas, alas, alas ! Only a very short while back,
when the Herald, having frenziedly helped to
lop off the official head of Commissioner Oliver,
the Australian, discovered Johnson, “ the up-to-
date English expert,” the old paper went fairly
off its head about Johnson. It declared wildly
that now N.S.W. would see how railways ought to
be run. JOHNSON would put everything right
with the railways ; Jonhson would solve the tram-
way problem (whatever that was); Johnson would
beat the band and bang Bannagher. Halcyon
days loomed ahead for the “producer” when
Johnson arrived. Johnson did arrive, and got
his up-to-date methods to work* and now the
Herald is weeping bitterly about the state of the
railways under the rule of Johnson. The rule of
Johnson, according to the Herald, doesn’t even
contain “commonsense”; what is wanted, so the
Herald wails, is a “practical man” (seemingly
Johnson isn’t a practical man). Let us have, says
the Herald, “practical business management”
(seemingly we haven’t received it from Johnson) ;
or at least, pleads the ■ -HfiRALD, if we can’t
get everything—at least, let us have “some
intelligence” (seemingly Johnson doesn’t even
possess that small item). And only a little while
The Battle.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The days of ease are over, the fiends of war are
out,
The red gods call our children to slay and march
and scout;
The smoke of burning cities, the clash of ringing
steel,
Throes of a world in travail, make thrones and
peoples reel.
Shrieks loud the flying shrapnel, the hate-urged
bullets hail,
Death blackens in the noonday, night hears the
stricken wail,
The seas are wild with terror, the lands are dumb
with fear,
The horror of the ages is pent and gathered here.
The Brown Man’s world in harness, the White
Man’s world at bay,
The ancient battle wakens that none may stop or
stay.
Not words shall leash the thunders, nor deeds our
fathers wrought,
Till our white faith in Freedom our own red hands
have bought.
Now are the torches kindled, and who shall
quench their flame?
Wild blood that throbs for vengeance recks not of
place or name;
Whaf’wealth shall buy your ransom, or save your
' sister’s pride,
’Mid the hoarse shout of triumph that tells the
breach is wide ?
White Australasia listens, grev-lipped, unarmed,
aghast,
The shadow of the horror o’er the wide oceans
cast ;
Her sword is in the making by hands inept and
slow,
While, girded with the lightning, swoops down
the sudden foe.
Cry to your gods of commerce, pile high your
bales of trade;
Was it with wool at Marathon the Persian march
was stayed ?
Did Sparta’s mutton exports defend Thermo-
pylae ?
And if our souls be souls of slaves, shall we yet
boast us free?
Ho ! heir of all the ages, go forward to the f^ay,
Armed with the Caveman’s weapons—a berserker
at bay—
Lose, grandly grim and helpless, the fight you
should have won
If for one day in fifty your hands had trained a
gun.

ago the Herald’s remedy for the alleged dis-
organisation of the Lands Department and every
other department was the appointment of “a
man like Mr. Johnson.” If Australia gets the
Herald’s awful Canberra capital, the chances are

The Dirty Councils of Victoria.
The Victorian Board of Public Health furnished
its anuual report to Bent the other day ; but up
to date it hasn’t made any more visible impres-
sion upon Thomas than a toothpick would have
wrought on a hippopotamus. The report notified
that, though tuberculosis was slightly on the de-
crease —there were 681 deaths in 1904, and only
619 in 1907—both diphtheria and typhoid fever
were increasing in the country, while decreasing
in the metropolis. Having mentioned these and
other results, the Board went on to speak of
a few causes. Of the whole of the coun-
try districts only Geelong and Warrnambool
have proclaimed themselves meat areas, thus en-
suring supervision of their meat supplies. The
Pure Food Act has been turned into a farce, only
67 of the 206 councils in the State having made
the statutory number of analyses, while 98 of
them, or almost half of the lot, took no samples
whatever. As for milk supervision, it was in
general too soon to speak with accuracy ; but the
Board was quite definite in two particular cases.
It sent officers lately to Ballarat, and out of 22
milk-dealers overhauled they found 21 cart-
ing skim milk round, and diluting the
fresh milk according to the stomach or
the acumen of the purchaser. • And it sent
inspectors to Warrnambool, and there they found
that the council’s inspector had so much other
work that he had no time whatever to devote to the
Pure Food Act, besides which he was paid nothing
for that work ; also they found that only three
samples of milk had been taken for analysis, and,
though two were found to be adulterated, the
council had declined to prosecute, and by its other
actions had shown a determination to nullify the
Act altogether. Naturally, while this policy of
hypocrisy continues—and Warrnambool and Bal-
larat are by no means the worst examples—cases
of diphtheria and typhoid and deaths therefrom
are likely to increase in the country districts.
Nevertheless, Bent merely bellows at large while
the hospitals fill up and the undertaker is run off
his feet.

Two Toms.
The S. Australian Labor party is shaking in its
boots. By keeping out of the clouds, and drop-
ping the chain-clanking business, it at last got the
State to trust it so far as to try what a Labor
Premier was like ; and Price has been such a
success that most of the vague fear of which the
Labor party used to be the victim—and still is the
victim in most places —was got rid of. Instead of
being a wrecker of the home, and a smasher of the
marriage tie, and an appropriator of other
people’s infants, not to mention other people’s
property, Premier Price and his Labor sup-
porters ' proved themselves to be tremendously
earnest and hard-working patriots, with the one
object of making the State happy and prosper-
ous, and securing a fair share of the happiness
and prosperity for those who have had the least of
those things hitherto. Proposals which, as pro-
posals, had scared a whole lot of the population,
proved when put into practice to be good, sound,
sensible ideas ; the best proof of that is to be got
from the fact that even the Anti-Sosh crowd (which
now disguises itself there as the National De-
fence League, or something like that) says;—“ Oh,
we always approved of that! In fact, we suggested
it.” Whereupon Tom Price is in the habit of
remarking pleasantly, “No doubt, no doubt!
And in that case, of course, you’ll help me with
this other little scheme of mine—of yours, I
mean ’’—and he brings in another proposal which,
in other States where the Labor party hasn’t had
the chance to inspire the same confidence, would
be shied at, and pronounced Socialistic and im-
practicable, and other similar things. The result
of it all is that in S. Australia you can be a
Laborite without being suspected of having a
bomb about your clothes. But just when the
party has got the State to trust it, Tom
Mann has been hired by the Broken Hill
unions to do some chain-clanking, partly at
Broken Hill, just over the border, and partly
at Port Pirie, which is inside S. Australia;
and the “National Defence League” grabs hold
of T. Mann’S mad, wild, gaseous remarks as the
finest; stick it has seen for many a day to beat the
Labor party with. The peaceful State which
hasn’t any Yarra Bank or Domain and doesn’t
know that Yarra Bank and Domain language is
nine-tenths hot air which does no harm and is
best got rid of—the peaceful State is being told in
whispers that Mann is a JOHN-the-BAPTisT sort
of person who blazes the track, and that what he
talks to-day the Labor party will do to-morrow.
So, especially in the country districts where it
was getting a firm footing, the S. Australian
Labor party has to do a great deal of it 3 work all
over again—and mighty hard work it is likely to
be. Yet the plain fact is that Mann belongs to
no Labor party in Australia, and, to quote one
of the S. Australian Laborites who Hasi gone
north to counteract the Mann influence, “I don’t
think it would be possible to find one member of
the Parliamentary Labor party in S. Australia
who endorses Mann’s opinions.” Mann, in fact,
belongs to an organisation which is as much
opposed to the Labor party as is the National Ass.
itself —an organisation which is, in fact, liable to
do grievous mischief to the Labor party because
it has repeatedly put forward candidates with no
hope whatever of winning, but with the one
practical result of splitting the Labor vote.
“ Ko'ndar” : TheMoree (N.S.W.) border district
is getting a fine experience of the need of Unifica-
tion and Reconstruction. Its nearest and natural
port is Brisbane ; but it is being assured that, as
Moreeis part of N. S. Wales, Moree’s interests lie
in patronising the N.S.W. railways, which take
the traffic to Sydney. In other words, under
the present system, the people in that part
of the country are assured that it will pay them
best to waste a lot of money in unnecessary
freight. The absurdity of that ought to be
apparent. If we had Unification and Reconstruc-
tion, with the Commonwealth owning the railways,
traffic would be encouraged to flow in its natural
channels, there would be no waste, and the general
prosperity would consequently be greater.
The same applies to other border districts ; many
of them are being deprived of the railways they
ought to have, because if they got them their
traffic would go “the wrong way.” For such
districts unification and the sweeping away of
the old State boundaries is the thing. A petition
is to be presented to the Federal Parliament
praying that a referendum shall be taken on the
question. Those who wish to help along a good
cause should write Mr. J. B. Steel, President of the
National Committee, 192 Castlereagh-street,
Sydney, who will supply petition forms to any

A letteb from Western N.S.W. :
N.S.W. Premier Wade’s silly blundering is more than
likely to land him in a sea of tragedy or the pit of ridi-
cule before long. The Labor Unions are straining in the
leash, and threaten to get out of hand any day, and if a
born leader comes to the top in the boil-over, Premier
Wade will find himself in a painful position. His Indus-
trial Disputes Act was always loyally hated by the
unionists, and its record has made their blood boil. It is
powerful to gaol union officers, but it is powerless to make
Tom Johnson reinstate the victimised tram strikers. It was
powerless to deal with Hoskins when he was charged with
having locked out his workmen, but it was ferociously
swift to gaol the paid servants of the Rockchoppers’
Union. The Union belief that it is an Act designed to
subvert Trades Unionism is certainly justified by the
record it has put up. So just now there are inN. S. Wales
thousands of men who are considering whether it isn’t
better to resort to open violence and revolt than submit
to having their treasured unionism slowly throttled.
What makes the position really dangerous is that
the majority of the unionists believe that the
man with the executioner’s face is only a tyrant
entrenched in a fortress of glass. It is doubtful if he can
read the Riot Act, and it is certain that he cannot call
out the military, as the troops are under the control of
the Common wealth. If Wade attempts to enforce his
law with armed police the position will become volcanic.
To order police to fire on the people would be to, sooner
or later, land Wade in the dock on a charge of making
war on the community. A British king once came to a
sudden end on that charge, and what has already hap-
pened to a monarch clothed in divine right might easily be
the fate of a legal upstart trying to masquerade as a Corn-
stalk Napoleon. WADE’sblunderingandlopsided legislation
is going perilously near to provoking a physical conflict.
The idea of secession from N. S. Wales appears to be grow-
ing rapidly on the Barrier. The first indication was the
angry snort that arose when the N.S.W. Government
refused to advance money for the completion of the
Umberumberka water scheme. It was then proposed to
ask Premier Price to advance South Australian money for
the work. Now the Industrial Disputes Act has roused
the organised Labor men to frenzy and decided them that
N.S.W. is a good place to get out of. So, briefly, they
propose to go, and take the Barrier with them.
— +
The N.S.W. Legislature has been calm of late,
compared to what it was in the days of 20 years
ago, when members used to carry each other
around by the hair, and when it took six officials
to take a member out, and then he fetched some
furniture and most of the dignity of the House
along with him. But within the last few days the
atmosphere has become electric, and a feeling is
abroad that stoush may happen at any moment.
Wade’s Contagious Diseases Bill and his Police
Offences Bill have caused anger to burn like a
volcano. The rock-choppers’ strike and the gaol-
ing of the strikers have been as kerosene poured
on a fire; and the feeling that something
is about to happen at Broken Hill, com-
bined with the action of the Wade Govern-
ment in sending up 50 extra policemen, has
had the same combustible effect that you get
when you put 12 celluloid collars on a bright fire
and then stand round and watch the conse-
quences. Speaker McCourt has now been at the
game for eight years, but he never struck a time
like this before, so he never before had a fair
chance to show his incapacity. He apparently
lost his head badly in conflict with Griffith,
M.L.A., and came out of the discussion a
flustered and heated personage. Griffith de-
sired to discuss, as a matter of urgency, the des-
patch of the police to Broken Hill, and the
Speaker bade him adduce some reason for the
urgency. Griffith made quite a number of
starts to expound the urgency of the case, but was
pulled up by an excited Speaker every time, until
at last it began to seem as if the Chair had become
so confused that Griffith couldn’t say anything
without being out of order. Griffith remained
out of order, according to the Speaker and other
authorities, for about two columns of small print,
and then at last he discovered one really orderly
thing he could do, and he did it—he resigned.
So his western electorate will have an election on
hand in addition to a possible strike, a possible
free fight, 50 extra policemen, the I.W.W. and
Tom Mann. It is a dangerous mixing of com-
bustibles. Wade’s new Industrial Disputes Act
seems to have led to a lot of combustible business.
And when the whole Labor party tramped indig-
nantly out of the House the other night it was
felt that something might break at almost any
moment.
-t-
Broken Hill has had a lot of secession move-
ments ; the one now on hand is probably the 20th
or the 51st or thereabouts. The Hill has always
been disgusted over its connection with N.S.W.
That State refuses to supply it with railway com-
munication (it depends for that on the S.A. State
lines and on a Victorian company), or water (it
depends for that on a Victorian company). It
pays for its own roads, and for its telegraphic
communications it relies on the Commonwealth.
The Hill sends to Sydney large sums in income-
tax and Customs duties and tram-fares, and it
receives back policemen and superannuated
tramcars; and it says that it doesn’t care
a tinker’s execration how soon the arrange-
ment ends. Moreover, if it threw in its lot with
S.A. the Barrier vote would just about put the
S.A. Labor party in a majority. Then the
Barrierites would have the satisfaction of being
with the party in power instead of forming a
shred of McGowen’s hopeless minority. The
Barrier member might be Labor Premier in S.A.
In N.S.W. he is merely suspended by order of the
House and ordered off the premises.

Brisbane is monkeying with a gun, and doesn’t
know the weapon is loaded—at least, some of it
doesn’t know the weapon is loaded. As big lots
of fat stock have been coming into the city, and
as “ a weekly yarding of 3000 is ample,” there is
an occasional glut—that is to say, the public has
an occasional chance of getting a cheap chop. It
is therefore proposed to introduce the Sydney
plan, which is described by the Courier in this
ingenuous way:—
Ten shillings per cent, is charged against all stock sold
through the yards, and this is placed to a fund for the
freezing works, which in return undertake to purchase
all sheep at a certain price if there are more in the pens
than will meet the metropolitan requirements. If tha c
plan works successfully in Sydney, there is, it is claimed >
no reason why it should not do so here.
If Brisbane lets in a system which Sydney would
be delighted to get rid of if it could, it deserves
to be bitten. The plan really works out this way :
There being always a buyer for the freezing works
in the market —a buyer whose bid is a fictitious
one because he gets a rebate—the ordinary buyer
has to go higher than the fictitious price. The
“freezer” doesn’t merely bid for the surplus
stock ; he is liable to bid for all the stock, and he
does bid if the market is at all limp. But when
he bids £lO he doesn’t have to pay £lO ; so he can
afford to bid for everything a fraction higher than
he reckons the beasts are worth, and in order to
get their requirements filled the ordinary buyers
have to bid still higher than that. It is a most
ingenious scheme for keeping up the price of the
public’s meat, and the city that adopts it is buying
a gold brick.

The American play of the Golden, Wild
or Woolly West is a stock sort of affair. Its
venue is a mining camp, and it contains a saloon
wherein foregather a number of rough but
wondrously chivalrous boys (the Western “boy”
resembles a Chow or other coolie inasmuch
as he remains adolescent till death), a
road-agent of fascination, a sheriff, a dis-
honest faro-dealer, an armory of revolvers,
a blizzard, a trail with a tendency to become
“blinded,” and a girl. Bret Harte discovered
the camp and its inmates in the first instance, and
playwrights have been sinking payable shafts there
ever since. “The Girl of the Golden West,”
which was staged at Sydney Royal last week, is
one of the most taking variants on the familiar
theme that has yet reached these parts. It doesn’t
pretend to be serious dramatic art. Its incidents
are connected by the slenderest threads. Nothing
happens because it must; a stirring “situation”
is in view every time. What matter that many
of the “situations” are grotesque in their im-
probability ? The programme shames the carping
critic by a quotation from “ The Early History of
California.” Says history, with a severe eye on
the giber:—
In those strange days people coming from God knows
where joined forces in that far western land, and here
they struggled, laughed, gambled, cursed, killed, loved,
and worked out their strange destinies in a manner
incredible to us of to-day. Of one thing only are we sure
—they lived !
Which is conclusive.
* * * *
Act I. shows the Polka saloon at the foot
of Cloudy Mountain. The Polka is owned and
run by The Girl. The Girl is the usual
wild, virtuous, near-to-nature maiden who is
born to tyrannise over and to be adored by
the simnle, blasphemous, bullock-hearted fellows
who pervade the drinking saloons of mining camps.
The entire population of Cloudy Mountain —■
barring a couple of Indians, a degraded Irish
gamester, a Greaser and a nigger minstrel—loves
The Girl to distraction. Jack Ranee, gambler and
sheriff, is particularly ardent. A sombre,
ominous figure is Ranee. His long, inky
curls and moustachios and glossy tall hat
throw into relief the deadly pallor of his
face, and bespeak the sea-green official, the
expert “deck” manipulator. Even as he is
telling The Girl of his love, and learning in the
process that there is “another,” a gay and
debonair figure strides into the saloon. It
is road-agent Ramerrez, alias Dick Johnson.
Johnson and The Girl have met and loved
in the not so long ago. Jealousy racks
the unhappy Ranee. Then comes the unmasking
of the road-agent by his rival. The weakest epi-
sode of the play occurs here. Ranee, sheriff and
gambler, consents to play poker with The Girl for
her lover’s life. He loses, The Girl having come
to the assistance of fortune at a crucial stage
in the game by producing three aces from
her stocking. The curtain falls on the
unlikely picture of Ranee, the incorruptible
sheriff, yielding up his prisoner, owing to Ranee,
the chronic gambler, having been bamboozled by
one of the hoariest devices in all card-sharperdom.
The third act shows The Girl in the r6le of school-
marm, teaching her “boys” to read, to recite, and
so forth. Suddenly, the note of tragedy strikes.
Johnson has been caught once more. However,
Johnson is not hanged. It is enough for the
“ boys ” that The Girl loves him. She takes the
trail with her Johnson, and when last seen is with
him on “the boundless prairies of the West,”
en route for another clime and a new life.
* * * *
Miss Tittell Brune is at her best as The
Girl. In the comedy scenes she is delightful, and
in Act 11. she provides a fine study of an undis-
ciplined young virago. That she doesn’t convince
in the preposterous gambling scene is not her
fault. Thomas Kingston is a gracious road-agent.
He handles an awkward part with notable skill,
so that he retires to hoe the hard row of honesty
with the warm sympathy of the audience trailing
in his wake. George Bryant makes an interest-
ing figure of Jack Ranee, and the miners—bonora
Slim, “Handsome’’Charlie, “Happy Halhday
and the rest —are the real thing, unless ■ lhe
Early History of California” lies.
The National Opera Company opened in
“Maritana” at Sydney Criterion on Saturday
last. As an art-form, light opera of the
“Maritana” sort is deader than the epigram-
paradox play. The melodrama of it is so pro-
nounced as to suggest burlesque of melodrama ;
its humor is of the pre-Miller school; and it has
few of the concerted items and choruses that
modern taste demands. It lives the relic-life it
does by virtue of its sweet ballads. Most of the
people who flock to “ IMaritana have been sing-
ing, or listening while others sang, its solo items for
more years than they care to reckon. In music
the familiar has an abiding charm. “Maritana”
recalls to a vast army of citizens 1001 nights of
boarding-house life, and the memory is not un-
pleasant. But it were hard for the wildest adorer of
the mid-Victorian furore to enthuse over the new
Criterion production of it. The acting is appalling
throughout. There are but two singers that call
for serious notice. Rosina Buckmann, who repre-
sents Maritana, has many of the assets that make
for success in soubrette parts -vivacity, a
pretty face and figure, and a voice, She appears,
however, to h&ve striven with her top notes at the
expense of the middle register, and the result is
raggedness and injustice to her own naturally
pure voice and to the sugary music of the score.
Wilson Pembroke’s Bon Gsesar is one of the most
bored, perfunctory desperadoes ever seen on any
stage. He suffers from the tired feeling that
attends over-solidity of flesh. He sings his
numbers artistically ; but it is the artistry of the
concert and not of the opera. The chorus and
orchestra do well, and the mounting is fairly
attractive.
** * *
“The Merry Widow” is now seven weeks
old, so far as Sydney is concerned ; yet there are
still few empty seats at Her Majesty s. Quite a
lot of the other seats are evidently filled by people
who, observing that the frail, frayed thing has
run so long, have turned up a second time to make
sure that they didn’t have liver when they saw it
the first time and thought so little of it.

Mr. T. J. West, of West’s Pictures (at Syd-
ney Glaciarium) has an operator touring with the
Wallaby footballers in England, and this week the
first of his pictures came to hand, showing the open-
ing match of the tour. It is a beautiful bit of
work, and is almost entirely devoid of flicker, but
the subject is too big, and to do it justice would
require a screen the size of the side of the Town
Hall. Just now it is the touring season at
West’s, and there are trips through the
South of France, through the Pyrenees, and other
interesting places. The great “4-inch motor
race” in the Isle of Man is interesting, but the
audience deplores the fact that there is not a
single smash in the race, and compares it very
unfavorably with the previous motor race shown,
when cars were bounding into almost every ditch.
One of the best fake pictures writer has seen for a
long time is the story of the fresh-laid eggs. The
man went out to buy half-a-dozen, but unfortun-
ately got screwed en route. And every lot of eggs he
bought got smashed, and he got more and more
drunk, till in the end he slithered along the
streets in a squatting position, pushing a basket of
eggs before him. When he got home his wife was
in bed, and he left the eggs in bed also. She
woke to hear a chirping, and behold, four-and-
twenty lovely chickens hatched in the darkness of
the night.

The picture show at Sydney Lyceum is
somewhat different from the common herd of
illustrations. In that hall of mystery, by means
of the chromo-megaphone the shadows that flit
across the screen have their own voices and talk
the language of living men. So in this way they
become immortal; they live because they
have the power of speech, yet, neyer having
lived, they are immune to death. The most
interesting picture at the Lyceum just now
is the Silent Hotel. In this hostelry there
are no servants, and the guest deposits his bag on
the floor to See it move automatically to his room.
He follows. As he takes off his clothes they hang
themselves up tidily, and when he presses a spring
a supper table rises through the floor with all that
he can desire. He sets the clock in the bed to
rouse him next morning, and is carefully deposited,
clothes and all, on the floor. The shower, the
breakfast, the brush-up and all the other adjuncts
of civilisation are supplied automatically. But
there are drawbacks : when he tries to leave with-
out paying his bill, he is restrained automatically
and pays under compulsion.

The Playgoers’ Dramatic Club is staging
J. C. Lee’s four-act play, “Wrexham’s Duty,” at
the Standard Theatre, Sydney, on the evenings of
Thursday and Friday, Nov. 19 and 20. The
object is to raise money for the Veterans’ Fund of
the Women’s Branch of the British Empire
League.
** * *
“A Miner’s Trust,” the British-Aus-
tralian drama which has had a brief preliminary
canter at Sydney Palace, will abscond from that
theatre on Friday, to make room for H. R.
Roberts and “ The Prince Chap.” “ The Chap
is described as a comedy-drama, so, presumably,
cheerful laughter will take the place of the blood-
stain and the horrid spectacle of the blood-
spattered victim. There was quite a lot of gore on
the “ Trust ” after the awful Gaspard Le Rouge
had shot Jack Howard with a 12-inch gun.

Having gathered together a bright group
of entertainers, Sydney Tivoli is content.
Comedian J. "W. Rickaby and tne musical
Latonas annex a large share of the applause ;
but, after they have helped themselves, a good
deal remains for Osborn and Brooks, the McGregor
trio, Fanny Powers and Ted Kalman. Duncan s
Scotch coliies are still playing harmoniously with
their paws and acting their great dog-motor
tragedy, “The Curdled Carburetter.’

“ The Scarlet Pimpernel,” although but a
hollow mockery of a dramatic story, appears to be
filling a want at Her Majesty’s, Melbourne. lor
one thing, the four acts are fairly light, and suffi-
ciently well-constructed to hold together, lne
fiction may be*dull at times, but it is not heavy.
And it has the quality of impudence in a distinct-
ive form. What time the roar of the populace is
law in Paris, and every aristocrat who gets into
prison is practically dead to the world, an impos-
sible English baronet is supposed to lounge
around the Court of the Prince Regent, directing
robberies of doomed foreign aristocrats from
prison, with the all-powerful cunning of a pro-
fessor Moriarty in “Sherlock Holmes. Theplav
offers no suggestion of how tne rescue rob-
beries are effected, or why the Scarlet Pimpernel
push should conspicuously pass mysterious^ notes
to one another in a crowded ballroom, or the

is no better than that of an Andersonian bellow-
drama. But it has the color of reasonableness and
the clothes of the period (or togs very like them),
and the manners of a dancing-master. Also it is
strictly moral in tone. One of the remarks made
by the Prince of Wales to Lady Blakeney is
probably giddy in intention, nevertheless it falls
harmlessly on the lady’s shell-like ear. The same
with the vague insinuations of the funereal
French Envoy, who, in an ordinary melodrama,
would make plain unholy love to Lady B. To the
best of the present writer’s recollection, there is
nothing in the whole of this unintellectual play to
make him blush like a pimpernel, or laugh like a
hyena, or sigh like a furnace. If Lady Blakeney
suffers any real distress of mind, Miss Ola Hum-
phrey fails to make it apparent, and if Julius
Knight’s character has genuine claims to admira-
tion, J ulius is a dissembler of the truth. One finds
nothing to praise or dislike in this painted, pass-
able play, nor anything to greatly appreciate in
the performance save the pungent diction of Leslie
Victor. The first duty of an actor is to let the
audience know what is being said on the stage.
Victor has a keener sense of duty than any other
member of the co. He ought to be awarded a
laurel crown for intelligibility, instead of which
he is put down a cellar and left in doubt and
darkness. From first to last of “The Scarlet
Pimpernel ” nothing is exempt from a shadow of
doubt.

All last week “The Prince of Pilsen ”
gave a liberal measure of dance and song and
highly-decorated story to large holiday audiences
at Melbourne Princess’s. When the cool reflec-
ts °f .the Cup aftermath come to be cast on
Pilsen,"’ it will probably look rather poor in
comparison with the average modern extrava-
ganza. All the happenings, except the
music, are echoes of old familiar occurrences,
whilst the melodies are mostly a feast of
sameness find a flow of reiterations. As
an entertainment for inveterate theatre-goers,
Pilsen ” has no special attraction. It is as bread
and cheese to a jaded palate. Also the hunk of
bread has an indigestible centrepiece in the
character of a Yankee Dutch brewer, imper-
sonated by Charles Loder, Loder, who gave a
us ef ul mall e r-°f-fa C t performance of a Dutchman
m The Bed Mill,” is a stodgy and pro-
longed jest as the jubilant brewer. In his
laborious endeavor to produce shrieks of laugh-
ter he sits in a fountain basin and
splashes .water over his baggy garments. This is
the fault, no doubt, of a lamentable librettist
who ordered the fountain for the brewer to get
wet in, but inasmuch as there are various low
comedy methods of sitting in water, and Loder’s
is not the finest of them, he must be charged with
aggravating the offence. Fortunately some of the
other peopJe—Fanny Dango, Fred Leslie, Ford
and Myles Clifton—have the spirit of frivolity in
them. Alma Barber is a sweetly sentimental
incident, and the chorus and the orchestra are
strong supports. An unaccompanied chorus by
eight men is notably effective.

At Melbourne King’s these are the last
nights of the serio-comic temperance drama
known as the Midnight Mail.” The accursed
black bottle that ruins Bert Bailey and damages
the welfare of George Cross will be laid aside at
an early date, and the engine that vomits sparks
from its funnel will return to the property-room

whence it came. Also the Terrible Turk will shed
his fez and resume the black belltopper of ortho-
dox iniquity when “The Midnight Mail” gives
place to “The Female Swindler.” The drama
last named is getting ready for business, and the
crimes of the heroine are in active preparation.
** * *
Melbourne Bijou’s latest thrill for the
million, “ The Power of the Cross,” is easily the
funniest bellowdrama since “ The Face at the
Window.” Moreover, the two outrages have
much in common. Their idiocies are similar, and
their two diabolical protagonists are from the
same stable, if not from the same stall. Both
beings acknowledge one sire, the Devil, and
one dam, probably Charley’s Aunt. But Baron
Woulfe Curzola, the miscreant in “The
Cross,” is the genius of the family. Le Loup,
in “The Face,” is mediocre and middle-
class by comparison. Woulfe despises cheap,
meretricious effects. He doesn’t conduct
his homicides with coarse butchery. He
is an artist. His murders have soul. When he
wants to polish off a person—and he prefers vir-
gins and plutocrats—it is impossible not to admire
his atmosphere and composition. The apartment
in which his careless victim-to-be is sitting is
slowly flooded with treacly gloom; the air
gets frosty; the mercury crashes down
into the bulb; there is a burst of hor-
r-rible, mirthless laughter that dies away in
sardonic tremolos and Woulfe is on the
threshold ! Drenched in green limelight—he is a
glutton for green—he glides in like a beautiful,
slender fountain-pen, his arms upraised, and his
face that of a dead consumptive. Slowly he flaps
the ether with his elongated paws, more slowly
still he augers the screaming patient with
his livid orbs, bends down, and sucks
the life-blood from the neck of the patient.
Yet, strange to say, he is ingrained with religious
superstition, probably inherited from a Wes-
leyan ma. The Cross terrifies and confounds him.
Perhaps owing to his religious tendencies, he is
perpetually outwitted by the comic relief, who
has to shout to be heard above the noise of his
clothes. Under those circumstances, Woulfe isn’t
such a success as he might be, but in comparison
to the others he stands out like a steeple on the
face of the plain. But he doesn’t save the drama.
It was born dead, or perhaps the vampire sucked
its blood before the curtain rose.

West’s Pictures at Olympia include the
latest Melbourne Cup, which, judging from the
faces of the assembled multitude, was a sad ending
to a period of joyful expectation. Views of Con-
stantinople, Versailles, and the “Eucharistic”

consideration, and a large assortment of broad
comedy pictures is relieved by the exciting story
of Nick Carter.

“ She Stoops to Conquer,” the old comedy
that cheers and does not inebriate, is completing
a payable fortnight at Melbourne Royal. It has
panned out very well, and Melbourne is to have
some more high-class plays at the same popular
prices. On Saturday the bill will take a serious
turn. Miss Madge Mclntosh is to appear as
Fedora, whilst Harcourt Beatty plays the Ipanoff
who causes all the trouble. With Graston Mervale
in the other strong part, “Fedora ” should be an
interesting revival.

but one of the Greatest Show on Earth. The herd
of elephants must shortly retire from Melbourne
for an indefinite period, and the avenue of animals
will then be replaced by a terrace of other
attractions. Those unenlightened persons who
have thus far stayed away from the giraffe, and
denied themselves the joys of the arena, are ad-
vised to delay no more. The circus cometh up
like a mushroom and vanisheth like a dream. It
is gone to-day and here to-morrow. But one
never knows what may happen meanwhile. The
writer has heard of an unfortunate old lady who
died without having seen the circus. Died and
was buried. He trembles for her future state.

programme.

The Margaret Anglin company is having a
steady boom at Adelaide Royal. It is quaint to
hear the French or English characters getting
very American as they grow excited, but the
effect is not unpleasing. “The Thief ” was actu-
ally more impressive at the second time of seeing.
Miss Anglin—who is somewhat more mature than
one had been led to expect—gives a wonderful
show. Stars who, playing “Raffles,” clutch the
air and roll their eyes and generally give their
criminality away three times a minute, may be
recommended to watch her quiet work. The sup-
port is worthy of the occasion, young Dion
Titheradge’s acting being, in the writer’s
opinion, fully equal to anything else on
view. “Zira” is more melodramatic than
“ The Thief,” and could probably be played about
as well by an actress of less than Miss Anglin’s
powers. At the Jubilee Oval, O’Donnell and
Beebee are running a benevolent balloon-ascent
show —benevolent because the Oval lies low on
the river bank, and the deadheads anywhere out-
side have all the upper-circle and gallery seats, so
to speak. The Tivoli has suddenly realised the
need for some variety in its variety show, and
has brought along Abdullah’s whirling Arabs.
The “Klickety Klicks,” otherwise the
Royal Dutch Packet Co. (Koninklijke Paketvaart
Maatschappij), who pervade the raging seas under
the special patronage and aegis of the Queen of
Holland, are doing things proud as far as
Australia is concerned. They have just specially
linked the beautiful land of Java with our own
Australia, the link being a fine line of passenger
steamships and two big men—oh, so big, nearly
14ft. high, that is, one on top of each other—Mr.
M. C. Konig and Mr. L. E. Cocheret. Now Mr.
Konig goes to the headquarters on the Zuyder Zee,
and Mr. L. E. Cocheret blooms into the managing
agent for Australia. Mr. Cocheret enjoys already
the reputation of being a charming sport, and in
shipping matters he is just “it.” The rivalry
between the “ Klickety Klicks ” and the “B.P.s”
is creating much interest in the shipping circles,
and drove Col. Burns to Java and to quill-driving

Recently died in London, at the notable age of 83 years,
William Farren, senior. He was born in 1825, and was
well known for his impersonations in old comedy. After
Phelps he was the Sir Peter Teazle of his period. He was
uncle to the late Nellie Farren, the burlesque actress who
was here with Fred Leslie in 1888 and 1891. The Farrens
were famous mummers. The deceased William was con-
nected with the family of Elizabeth Farren, afterwards
Countess of Derby, and was grandson of William Farren
(1725-1795), who was the original Careless in “The School
for Scandal.” Also he was son of the admirable comedian
of the same name who, in the first half of last century,
excelled as Sir Peter Teazle and other old beaux. Thus
William, just departed, was the third of his race in lineal
descent to play in “The School for Scandal." Three
days after his demise died Robert Soutar, in his 81st year,
husband of the late Nellie Farren. In the old days .he
used to he a familiar, tall, gaunt figure as he stalked about
the old Gaiety, the temple wherein the sacred lamp of
burlesque kept up its flicker till it was a lone survivor and
all its fellow lamps were mere dead wick and smell. In
those days he was stage manager for John Hollingshed.
His son, Farren Souttar (the well-known comedian with
Edwardes’ eo.), is one of the fifth generation of a family
that has amused London for over 130 years.
“ S.” : I saw a one-time fairly popular Australian actor
on the flat at Flemington on Cup day. He was standing
behind a steaming can, loudly declaring in the fruity
tones that made his Ghost remarkable in the days when
he Hamleted : “ Here you are ! Here you are ! Sausage
and roll only 3d. 1” The sight touched me, but, after all,
if the shoemaker should stick to his last, the actor should
cleave to his r6le.
“ Kodak” : I met Frank at 7.15 at the G.P.0., and we
decided to go and see “ The Merry Widow.” We ap-
proached the box-office and laid 10s. reverently on the
counter. Two checks were handed to us, and we climbed
to the dress-circle and sat down. The orchestra played,
the lights went down and the curtain went up. Beautiful
scenery, beautiful dresses, beautiful girls. Beautiful
girls did nothing much except stroll about and look
beautiful; sometimes they stood in a ring and looked
beautiful; now and then they turned round and showed
their beautiful bare backs. After about 10 minutes of the
comedian staff, I began to suspect they were making up
the dialogue as they went along. Jokes long ago pen-
sioned off the variety stage were dragged in by the ears
with their reluctant hoofs digging into the stage. The
business of the various leading ladies was to pretend that
they hadn’t heard the chestnuts before, and occasionally to
retort with an epigram so forced that it was black in the face
from want of breath. After the explosion of ah epigram,
the couple invariably linked arms and walked off laugh-
ing in each other’s faces whilst the audience sat in silent
amazement. The first scene was an alleged ball at some
embassy at which three couples waltzed three times up
and down the hall. A herd of men kept following the
Widow about like a lot of hungry magpies. The Widow
walked up and down in front of them singing one of the
half-dozen tunes that comprise the opera, and all the
men moaned in unison. Lateron, the stage was cleared and
a young man in evening-dress, with a red-lined woman’s
opera-cloak round his shoulders, staggered on. He sang
at great length of the delirious happiness to be had down
at Maxim’s. We referred to the programme and found
that Maxim’s was situated in the third act. We
agreed to stay on and see what Maxim’s was like.
The second act was laid in an Eden-like garden
filled with beautiful chestnut trees, and the come-
dians pelted each other joyously with the forbidden
fruit and were childishly happy. The curtain eventually
fell with an exhausted thud, and we walked out to get
some fresh air and a drink to prepare us for Maxim’s.
After the interval, the curtain climbed heavily up out of
the way, and Maxim’s disclosed itself as a place where
people were carefully gay and ladies showed that Re-
spectability was a dead letter by furiously shaking their
underskirts. Whilst they shook, the other characters sat
at tables in dead silence, or strutted aimlessly in and out.
They ate nothing and drank less. A flavor of reality was
given to the scene by one fair Parisienne talking broken
English to the Patagonian Ambassador. It made me
think of the way the Australian housewife invariably
barters with the vegetable John in dog-Latin. Frank
and I left promptly at curtain fall. Friends who have
been several times tell me that the show grows on you
after about the third visit. I don’t want to acquire the
Widow habit. I’ve got too many vices already.
“ Bantock’s Friend”: Snazelle’s gag, as Bouillabaise in
“ Paul Jones,” was “ Ain’t it sickenin’ ? ” It is—l mean
the yarns that are going round again about the star
actresses invariably picking the winners in races like the
Metropolitan, Caulfield Cup or Melbourne Cup. Go and
collect their tips for the Melbourne Cup and see what a
hole you’ll be in. I solemnly declare that whenever a
leading actress names a steed for a race the Devil claps
131 b. upon it. That wonderful horse that the star actress
always backs is a fraud and a dead meat.
Australia is to get the Immortal Bard on an extensive
scale in the not distant future. Oscar Asche, the Sydney
native, who learned his acting abroad, is to bring a
Shakspearian company from England under engagement
to the Clarke-Meynell-Gunn firm. With the co. comes
the charming Miss Lily Brayton (Mrs. Asche) and a cargo
of scenic fixings.
“Melb.”: A testimonial is being got up to Edward
Armes Beaumont. He was one of Vicar Handfield’s
original surpliced choir at St. Peter’s. Lyster engaged
him for opera. His Thaddeus in “ The Bohemian Girl,”
his Don Caesar in “Maritana,” and his Faust were highly
appreciated. After five years he accidentally received a
charge of small shot full in the face, fired by Lyster’s
brother— not by Fred Lyster. Sherwin, another operatic
tenor, lost an arm in a similar way. So did Charley
Sutton, Billy Emerson’s opposite end man. Then there
was Dante, the wizard, killed out shooting. And
theatrical architect Pitt has just lost two fingers.
Moral: Thespian folk in Australia aren’t good at guns.
Beaumont was superbly treated by oculist Gray.
One eye was lost, the other badly damaged. How-
ever, he was back on the operatic stage. His
new parts had to be taught him by his sister,
Mrs. Fox, or by brother Dan. Yet the combination
of Beaumont and Mrs. Simonsen, In “L’Africaine,”
at the old wooden Princess’s, beat that of Squires and
Lucy Escott on alternate nights. A very clever woman
was Lucy Escott, but her voice was faded and worn, and
Squires had to sing half falsetto. When Lyster turned to
opera bouffe, Beaumont was again indispensable. He
began, in company with Mrs. Simonsen and Farley,
in “ The Grand Duchess.” What a triumph was Farley’s
General Boom! Beaumont never was a waster. Like
Stewart and Harwood, he saved. Like them, he burst
when the banks of Matthew Davies and Bent and Gyles
Turner and Jimmy Munro did their awful fall. He had
to go teaching’, under great disadvantages. He is the
best preserved man in Melbourne, and doesn’t look more
than a few days over 40. Love, honor and troops of
friends are his. So it is up to the community to give him
some coin.
The peculations of Miss Anglin’s heroine in the drama
of “ The Thief’’are almost justified by the following par.
in a London clothes journal—the Lady’s Pictorial. Says
that deplorable publication: “The well-dressed woman
can afford to be plain, she can lack intelligence, she may
even be dull and disagreeable, but she commands atten-
tion wheresoever she goes ; she is envied, she is creditable
to her husband.”
A wife may be a vixen and a fool,
And all unpleasant things that one can mention,
If in summer she looks elegant and cool,
And atones for her stupidity at school
By commanding jealous womankind’s attention.
Though her countenance be ugly, temper ill,
Unlovable whichever way you take her,
She’s a credit to the man who pays the bill
If her gowning and her incidental frill
Befleet especial credit on her maker.
An Australian journalist now visiting Dublin writes
concerning Glasnevin Cemetery. In one of the ap-
proaches to the O’Connell circle—where lie Daniel O’Con-
nell’s remains—is a life-size statue of one who is well
remembered by the older people of Melbourne—Barry Sul-
livan. The famous actor is represented as Hamlet hold-
ing in his hand the skull ofYorick. The inscription on
the pedestal is too brief:
Barry Sullivan.
After life’s fitful fever he sleeps well.
“ J.P.” : The latest thing on the stage to catch the eye
of the Methody parson is the classic dance, a la Maud
Allan. Maud is the young lady who has recently re-
discovered the very old fact that partial nakedness is a
marketable asset. When she butted into the “ classic ”
dance business she realised that to make a success of it
her body would have to be considerably free of covering.
This shows the lady’s perspicacity, for a girl can make a
success of almost anything on the stage if she leaves
enough of her clothes in the dressing-room. The same old
remark about ennobling influences, etc., has been dragged
forth on behalf of Miss Allan. London will never admit that
it rushes wildly to the show because the lady is partly nude;
for although London loves to be wicked, it always con-
trives to enjoy itself under the cover of “elevating in-
fluence,” etc. The latest exponent of this classical art of
undress is Phyllis Monkman, now appearing at the Apollo
Theatre in the musical lunacy “Butterflies.” If the pic-
ture I saw is fairly accurate, she appears in the third act
robed becomingly in a pair of gauze wings and a smile.
The only covering on the upper part of her body is a
breastplate of jewels and a few strings of glittering stones.
On the lower part of her body I failed to descry even a
breastplate. After this I was quite prepared to hear that
her poses and dancing are “decidedly poetic and un-
objectionable,” a sort of glorified Howl of Solomon, in
fact. Now, what will the next lady have on—that next
lady who has always to go one better?
“ D.” : An item in the current London papers, notify-
ing that the Imperial Theatre is being pulled down, shows
the hopelessness, in London or elsewhere, of erecting a
big playhouse outside the tiny radius that the wealthier
theatre-goers affect. I remember the building of the
Imperial (it was only completed seven years ago) and the
gorgeous place it was when it was first opened. It sur-
passed all other London theatres in the matter of comfort.
The carpets were astounding, and the latest cries in chair-
backs, orchestras, box fittings and so on obtained. But
all this glory was in Westminster, on “ the other side of
the Park,” and hence it was so much wasted glory. A
few people called and revelled in it for a while, but its
fortunes rapidly wilted. It was as though a Sydney
speculator had built a second Her Majesty’s on Potts
Point. Mrs. Langtry, whose enterprise the Imperial was,
must have dropped a pile of money in connection with it.
A theatre which isn’t a “ winner” is as sure a depleter of
banking accounts as a racing stud with the same trouble,
or a big daily paper that nobody buys.
“The Tramp”: The contraption that throws shudder-
ing figures at a screen, and causes them to behave thereon
in an inhumanly eccentric fashion, has gone by some
diverse names in M.L. in its time. Some of them: Kine-
matograph, cinematographe, biograph, biorama, bioscope,
operascope, circus-scope, theatregraph, wonderscope,
marvel-o-scope, bio-chronoscope, uniscope, chrono, pro-
jectoseope, pathegraph, and theatrescope. And now an
entrepreneur of imagination presents “ humanised pic-
tures.”
HOW CHING WAS “SHOPPED.”
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Another Tivoli engagement of magnitude is Ching Ling
Soo, the Chinese magician. I saw him at the London
Hippodrome, boiling dead ducks and rabbits in a cauldron
of water, and bringing them out alive, and despaired of
getting him. —Harry Rickards in S. M. Herald.
I gazed on Ching
Ling Soo, the Chow,
My breath came short.
I muttered “ How
The blazes does
The yellow cow
Manage his shows ? ”
I saw him boil
A barnyard bird
In water. Lo!
After he’d stirred
The corpse a while,
A crow was heard—
The dead arose.
Forthwith around
Me utter joy
Prevailed ; folks said:
“ My dear old boy,
Ling is a pearl
Without alloy.
You two must meet.”
But I—I shook
A hopeless head;
“ I am not worth-
Y, friends,” I said,
“ To treat with him ;
My pride lies dead
At Talent’s feet.”
Then to me came
Good friends and true,
Who calmed my fears
And said, “ Ling- Soo,
Though very proud,
Is not undu-
Ly so. Cheer up.”
I called on Ching,
Sidestepped his kiss,
And mentioned terms.
I heard him hiss :
“Me savee, Yes.”
Wondering bliss
Flooded my cup.

MAUD’S MIRACLE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“If,” she went on, “the first love was shattered by
disillusion, I see no reason why a woman should not love
again ; but this time it would be with more head.” — From
remarks on First and Second Love, by Miss Maud Allan,
the O so lightly-clad dancing girl.
O, the fine bouquet and sparkle of the brew of Love-in-
Youth !
O, the first ecstatic gurgle as you drain the foaming
glass!
O, and O, the sudden thrilling of that fountain-draught
of Truth,
As it sweeps along your veins, and brings a miracle to
pass 1
O, there’s joy and soul-uplifting in the long, long beer of
Love !
And the sweet intoxication of the springtime tipple,
this
Is splendid, but it’s quite another matter when you shove
Your glass across, and bellow for a second draught of
bliss.
For, though the big Love-sleever may display a lovely
head,
And sparkle now with just a dash of cash and family
plate,
You cannot get the good old “bite”—its glorious tang
has fled !
There’s nothing like that first, long pull of Cupid’s
nectar, straight 1

WINES
The duplicated numbers and obliterated
numbers and no numbers at all on many houses in
Sydney and suburbs worry grey into the gold of
the new postman’s whiskers. One despotic old
Macquarie is worth a cowyardful of modern
mayors where civic business is concerned. When
the number worry woke in his time, he issued a
prompt order that all houses in the lanes and
streets of Sydney should be numbered at sixpence
a house, that every occupier should pay his own
sixpence, and that two painters, whom he named,
should start on the job next day and keep at it
till finished.
Some people seem prepared to go to any
lengths to avoid payment of their rates. At
Dunolly (Vic.), one day recently, some miscreant
broke into the shire council hall and boned the
whole of the general and water rate books, besides
the rate cash-books and receipt books. With the
exception of a little candle-grease and some hoof-
marks, he left nothing behind him. Prosecutions
were pending for overdue rates, and it is assumed
that the thief was trying to prig the council’s only
available evidence. If he was, the council
reckons he has made a mistake. The local solici-
tor had already got a list of the arrears, and the
criminal has dragged much bulky literature over
the face of the country to no purpose. He hasn’t
been found; but then nobody is found in Vic-
toria these days unless he wanders down Bourke-
street with the mangled remains under his arm or
the severed head in his hand.
“ 1-3-6,” in reply to “ 10-2-4,” re N.S.W.
Chief Justice Stakes :
The “dapperness” I referred to in regard to Knox in
discussing his O. J. Stakes form was mental, not exter-
nal. The curatical Equity men never seem to come into
close contact with human nature until disputes arise about
the deceased’s testamentary intentions, and then they
wrangle by affidavit for weeks and weeks and weeks, until
they have divided the estate equitably—which means
among themselves. No Equity man has the faintest idea
of evidence, or of the strength or credibility of witnesses.
A 0. J. would have to try jury cases and revel in details
where human nature runs riot in all its exuberance.
“ Oullen is a sound lawyer, but has no other qualifica-
tion.” Well, we don’t know that either Gordon or Knox
has any other —or even that. But I suggest that
Cullen’s political experience in both Houses has broad-
ened him. As to Shand, he is exactly the type
of man at the Bar that the present; C.J. was
—and, with all his faults, the C.J. has been the
soundest lawyer and the best Judge on the N.S.W. Bench
for a long time past. The trouble in N.S.W. is that the
smart lawyer Judges are so eccentric and unjudicial,
while the men with fine judicial temperament, patience
and sweet reasonableness are not learned lawyers. They
are better Judges, however. An amalgam of G. B.
Simpson and E. Cohen would be an ideal judicial appoint-
ment. “ 10-2-4 ” joins issue violently with me about
G. H. Reid. Of course, Reid can’t win every case ; neither
could Tommy Hales or Barden win on a cronk horse ; but
he can get all there is out of his mount. Politically I
have no time for Reid ; but in a case like the single
one I cited, Reid didn’t need “ Crick’s fine brain ’’.behind
him. It was a matter where the experience of a
lifetime and certain special qualities were applied
for half-an-hour to a great human incident. Gordon’s
prosiness is inward and outward ; his law, his
argument and his manner are steeped in commonplace.
He is learned but not illuminative. As to the dapperness
of British judges : I personally know that Charles Rus-
sell was anything but dapper in the sense of being sar-
torially spruce. His forensic manner was virile, nay brutal.
In N.S.W., where the Equity jurisdiction is carefully
cloistered off from all vulgar contact with the outer air
of common sense, and where the arguments are delivered
in subdued, collection-plate tones, as of a cathedral and
dim aisles and vaults, the successful Equity man must be
dapper, mentally and physically, or he is discouraged. I
still plump for a choice between Cullen and Shand, and I
put my money on Shand.

“ Nimshi ” on the subject of the ex-
pression, “The finest in the Southern Hemi-
sphere ” (B. 22/10/’08): —
. I have seen Buenos Aires, Rio Janeiro, Santiago and
Sao Paulo. They are all dirty, and not one of them
equals Sydney for picturesqueness and beauty.
The only worthy thing- in Buenos Aires is the news-
paper office of LaPrenza. The sole distinction of Rio is
not its harbor, nor Corcovada, the mountain peak,
but its magnificent esplanade. Sao Paulo (pro-
nounced “ Sow Powlo ”) possesses the largest smell
on earth, Port Said being beaten by a neck.
Santiago is a half-baked village where the four-
shilling dollar fetches 9d. Your correspondent
William could not have stayed at the Mount Nelson
Hotel, Capetown, very long. The flies there wear white
vests and come under the Goat By-laws. The Shamrock
at Bendigo beats hollow the Mount Nelson at Capetown,
and the Hydro at Medlow Bath (N.S.W.) is away out of
sight. Billie must have clung to a buffer of the Zambesi
express. I have been there, and to call it a train de luxe,
as Nannie’s brother does, is to misuse a handy French
phrase. Its characteristics are bad food, flies, dust and
stuffy carriages, same as you meet on all trains in the
Southern Hemisphere, except in Australia.
There is only one thing William can keep belonging to
the Southern Hemisphere, and that is the Southern
Cross, simply because it does not belong. That is to
say, I saw it at Perim Island in the Red Sea, about 11°
north. The Southern Cross is a mean constellation, and
it is claimed by Willie’s South American and South
African friends, and they can have it.
FOR HEARTH AND HEMPIRE.
The only organisation that has kept up active work on
its side since the last election is the Woman’s National
League, and that body is crippled because the small sum
necessary to enable it to continue is not forthcoming.—

Monday, October 19, was quite a gala day
among the aboriginals at Ulgandahi Island, Lower
Clarence River (N.S.W.). On that day, two
clerics performed the marriage ceremony over six
aboriginal couples—Warbie Laurie and Jessie
Larrigo, Combo Nodo and Rosy Yamba, Hugh
Cowan and Maggie Whitton, Tom Ridge and
Ellen Brown, John Cameron and Kitty Campbell,
and Jack Flanders and Elsie Webb. “Rheu-
matic” rings were used. One darkie, who had
been keeping house with two Mrs. Tanquerays
(they were sisters), refused to marry either. He
wouldn’t mind marrying both ; but, if he married
the old one the young one would be jealous, and
if he married the young one the old one would
feel bad. He was content with the two, and the
two were content with him, and the missionary
had to be content with the lot.

Melbourne’s stomach won’t feel any the
better for some recent admissions at a Customs in-
quiry. It was alleged against a firm of butchers
of Bourlce-street that they gave an officer
of the steamer Cooma an export permit which
declared that a parcel of 20 sides of pork
conformed to the provisions of the Commerce
Act, whereas, it was declared, 10 of them were
really unsound. On this point the supervisor of
the city abattoirs gave evidence as to the
methods adopted in the examination of meat.
Local supervision, he remarked, is not so ex-
treme as that for export. If, for instance,
the lymphatic glands of a carcase for local
consumption were affected with tuberculosis,
they would be removed by the inspector,
or the head would be cut off and the carcase
would then be passed. A nice, quiet, con-
soling piece of information, to say the least
about it! Meat that is not fit for the over-
sea stomach is apparently passed for diges-
tion by the local baggy organ. If this prac-
tice is pursued, Melbourne had better turn vege-
tarian. In some respects, it is better to be even
a vegetarian than a corpse.

The returned Cohentingenter refuses to sit
down and be quiet; also he rejects all advice to
conceal the fact that he was one of the 300,000
who struck terror to the heart of the South African
hen. A little while ago, some of the erring knights
foregathered and offered to form themselves into
a regiment if they were offered sufficient en-
couragement. The encouragement wasn’t forth-
coming, the Minister for Defence offering them
neither hens nor money. Everyone thought the
last had been heard of it, but the distressing pro-
ject was again referred to at a reunion of the mis-
guided ones, held recently in Melbourne. Poultry
owners are fearfully excited about the matter, and
eggs threaten to bound up to unheard-of prices
unless the scheme is declared off.

Three Melbourne till-sneaks recently for-
got something. Four of them went into a photo-
grapher’s on Cup afternoon, when the policeman
was mostly away on the course. One sat for
his photo., and the other two levanted with the
cash while the photographer was busy with the
operation. The snap-shottist promptly locked
his subject in and chased the other two, but
couldn’t catch them ; and when he got back he
found the third had left per window. Then he
calmly proceeded to develop the negative, and
presently handed the police a proof, which they
immediately recognised. It was a complicated
proceeding, but it promises to end badly for
somebody. The lunacy of being photographed
while on a burgling expedition is beyond all
words.

The indigent septuagenarians of Britain
staggered up to the post offices in battalions on
the first day of the issue of old-age pension forms.
The maximum pension allowance is ss. a week,
and the minimum age of qualification is three-
score years and ten, yet in London alone the first
tide of applicants numbered 50,000. Most of
them had a notion that the form obtainable at any
post office would be an order for 55., payable over
the counter as soon as it was filled in. _ When
they learned that their cases would be inquired
into by the authorities with a view to the reduc-
tion or stern refusal of their exorbitant claim,
they went away in tears, remarking that January
1 (the legal birthday of the Act) was a long way
off, and the winter would probably kill them in
the meantime.

he could not vote for it.
Mr. Lemmon : You are judging the whole of the State
by the ladies of Toorak.
Mr. Bayles: That would not be a bad standard either.

Oh women of Australia, and ladies, if you please,
If you want to serve your country you should live a life

Persuade yourself you do not spring from common, vul-
gar dust.
If you yearn to be politically equal with the males,
Pray note the standard pointed out by lofty Mister
Bayles.
Put aside domestic duties, and, whatever else you lack,
Imitate the modes and manners of the ladies of Toorak.
Oh, the ladies of Toorak, on the upper social track —
High and haughty ; how the “ Pawty ” loves to have them
at its back.
You must live for social pleasure,
Vote for Tory man and measure ;
You must live a life of leisure, like the ladies of Toorak.
Never, never in the morning wear your diamonds in the
street,
And be very, very careful whom you condescend to
“meet.”
Recollect that nursing children is considered rather
wrong,
And you must not let your daughter out without a
chaper-png.
Prithee, don’t be too familiar with your chauffeur or your
cook,
And regard all “ working people ” with a cold, disdainful
look.
To be worthy of the franchise “put on dog” or else,
alack,
You can never reach the level of the Naicest in Toorak.
P’raps your husband may expect you now and then to
cook a chop.
If you’re truly patriotic, you would sooner see him drop
Dead before you soil your fingers with a task so mean
and low.
Women voters, household duties are politicly de trop,
You may be a trifle flighty if you’re slim and young and
strong ;
But you must be staid and haughty if you’re old and
ombongpong.
These and other Toorak manners, women voters, closely
note,
If at all intelligently you would exercise your vote.
As for Socialists—oh, ladies, shun them as you would a
plague !
And adhere to B. Smith’s tenets, tho’ they are a trifle
vague.
In regard to population—should you own a kid to whack,
Keep it dark ; for vulgar babes are not the fashion in
Toorak.
Oh, the Naicest in Toorak—all the babies that they lack
Would extend from Yarra Bend up to Bendigo and back.
Youngsters are not in the running ;
Dogs are far more cute and cunning
To the starchy and the stunning staple product of
Toorak.

The December number, now going through the
press, is as full of good “meaty” matter as was
that of November. A preliminary hint as to
some of the features:
Victor Daley : The anniversary of the poet’s
death falls in December. Arthur Bayldon, who
has not published any verse for many years,
breaks silence with a fine commemorative poem.
A work as yet unpublished of Daley’s is printed,
and a fine photograph of the dead poet.
Lourdes : An Australian lady, who joined the
pilgrimage to Lourdes last year, tells how she
noted miracles of healing at the famous shrine.
Star-Watchers of the South : Hugh McKay,
a fine writer, and a noted student of astronomy,
tells of the star worlds visible from our continent.
The Australian Drama —Why Isn’t It ?:
Arthur Adams tells candidly of his experiences as
a writer of plays, most of which have not been
produced.
Those are four items to look forward to. More
about features next week.

While a Sydney policeman was taking the
corner air, t’other day, there came to him a
citizen. He differed only from the next citizen
in that he limped, and that there lurked within
him the calm determination of the “doer.” He
quietly stood before the Law till its eye inquir-
ingly transfixed him. Then he spake. His voice
was calm, and measured, and very earnest. But
the air grew suddenly very still, and then it grew
very blue; the pavement became hot and a
crimson glow appeared on the sky, and terrified
citizens shouted “Fire.” Then the staggered
John dragged himself from a stupor and cut off
the flow of language by collaring the source at the
neck. The citizen explained to the Bench next
morning. His leg had been bad for a long time,
he said, and the gaol hospital treatment having
been highly recommended to him, he hit the
happy idea of trying “language” as a means of
getting it. He was sorry if he had overdone the
language, but he wanted to make sure. A month’s
free treatment, with board, was supplied to him,
and if his leg isn’t better at the end of the month
he will probably find another policeman and say
something worse to him.

The Customs Department has just come
to the end of the story of A Manuscript Found in
a Bottle. On April 16, 1842, Philip Gardner
threw overboard from the ship Kelso, bound from
London to Sydney, a bottle containing a memo-
randum of the vessel’s then latitude and longitude,
and a request that the finder should pass it on to
the nearest authorities. Thirty-five years later
the deadest of all marines came ashore on the Vic-
torian coast, and was sent along by the Wilson’s
Promontory lighthouse-keeper to Trade and Cus-
toms Commissioner R. S. Anderson, who for-
warded an- account of the affair to the British
Admiralty hydrographer. After that another 31
years rolled on, and finally the ancient story was
revived a month ago by a letter from James
Gardner, of Perth (Scotland), a relative of the
Kelso passenger, to Customs Minister Chapman,
asking for the original memorandum for family
heirloom purposes. Chapman accordingly set
some one burrowing among the dark and grimy
places of the Department, and the 66-year-old
document was dragged into daylight again. It
was in excellent condition, and has been sent to
Scotland.

Some quaint stories re a Tatt.’s sweep
winner are circulated in Melbourne. The favored
child of fortune in this case was a cautious old
agriculturist, who took his luck rather gloomily.
Too cautious to collect his unearned thousands
through a bank, he went over to Hobart to pre-
sent his ticket in person, and with the idea of
getting all the prize in gold he borrowed a money
bag from a neighbor. The neighbor had been in
the habit of keeping a couple of bent threepenny
bits in the bag “for luck,” and they were there
when he loaned the receptacle to the farmer, but
when the bag came back from Tasmania it was as
empty as a drum. The old chap had gathered the
two thrums into his personal estate. Presently
he crowded his fortune into a pocket-book, put a
horny hand on the breast pocket in case of acci-
dents, and went off to Premier Bent for informa-
tion as to the best Government stock to put his
sweep money into. Bent seemingly was in too
much of a hurry to listen to all the yarn, so he
said, “My good man, go on the Land!” “But,
sir,” said the gloomy visitor, “I’m just off the
land.” The story ends here.

Forty-five shillings a week, and a wife
and six children to keep, was solicitor Abigail’s
plea for leniency in the case where an employee
of Hordern’s great Universal Providery was
charged with stealing four suits of clothes and two
pairs of ready-made unspeakables. The First
Offenders Act was applied. There are cases
when the First Offenders Act ought to be supple-
mented with a donation of at least £l.
CUP WEEK.—A STORY WITHOUT WORDS.
Broken Hill didn’t put much spirit into its
effigy-burning of State Premier Wade the other
evening ; it bubbled over when it first heard that
50 more police had been sent up, but later on it
put a wet towel round its head, and then most of
it decided that effigy-burning wasn’t much of a
game for enfranchised men and women after
all. The last time Broken Hill played the
game was in the wild and woolly days of its first
boom, when its water supply was just about run
out, and it had applied in vain to Uncle Abigail,
then Parkes’ Minister for Mines, for something to
drink. The crowd of that day honored Uncle
Abigail with a hearse, and a Gent One was
present to read the funeral service; he sat on top
of t,he hearse to do it. But Wade had to descend
to the tail of a spring cart; and there is no boom
nowadays, wherefore there was also much less
beer.

There was something extra in the way of
a clearing-out sale in Sydney the other day.
Freeman and Wallace, the don’t-you-feel-weil-
young-man people, who used to spend thousands a
year in advertising—their bill in one year, it is
alleged, reached £l4,ooo—had poured over them
recently the most blistering remarks that have
come from the N.S.W. Supreme Court Bench
for many a year ; and what with that, and the
verdict, and Costs, and other hard knocks,
the auctioneer was called in to sell up the
whole show. And an amazing show it was.
The offices—piles of offices—looked as though
two earthquakes had fought three rounds in
each room. The letters from the young men
who didn’t feel well were scattered six inches
deep over the floor, and the firm’s typewritten
letters to the man who had specks before the
eyes rose like icebergs in half a dozen corners.
The crowd that turned up to get the bar-
gains jammed itself into poky offices and
winding stairways, and squeezed out the
ghosts, and any man who happened to
wink off a bead of perspiration found
that a gross of “No. 7” medicine had
been knocked down to him for Is. lid.
Remarkable-looking, weird electrical con-
traptions which must have cost £5O or £lOO
were sold to daring speculators for £6 or £B. The
boss of a city social-purity mission, who was nosing
round in search of thrills in a new “den of
iniquity,” found a typewriter handed to him
for £6—a typewriter that had been worn out in the
struggle to assure the young man that if he didn’t
send £l9 10s. at an early date he would be Lost.
And then desk after desk was sold—desks that
looked as though they had been left in a hurry
(evidently when the two earthquakes arrived on
the landing), and, probably on the strength of
what might be inside them, they sold for as much
as £l5. Still the social-purity mission man who
bought the wicked old typewriter will probably
get the most beautiful revelations, if only he can
get the weary instrument to tell all it knows.

The poor Australian who reckons that
this country can’t make a broom-handle has got
something else to look at now when he runs
down from Sydney to Manly “ to get the cobwebs
blown out”—the cobwebs that the S. M. Herald
and the Telegraph spin every morning in the
cavity where his brain ought to be. The co. which
makes fat divs. out of the Manly traffic was in-
duced some years ago to give Mort’s Dock and
Engineering Works a chance to prove whether
they couldn’t turn out a boat that would at least
keep right side up. The co. was a bit doubt-
ful, but at last it decided to take the risk, and an
order was given. The craft was turned out so well
that a second followed, and after that a third.
And the Sydney person who votes Freetrade every
Federal election was so well satisfied with
the work of the Australian co. that he
went down to Manly twice as often as
he used to, and took the Other Lady with
him when his own wife hadn’t quite finished the
scrubbing ; wherefore 50 per cent, more trips have
to be run than were run five years ago, and the
co.’s profits have been just about doubled. And
still the limit hasn’t been reached ; wherefore the
co., which isn’t doubtful any longer, ordered a
fourth vessel from the same Australian works a
few months ago. Finally, having just seen the
new vehicle, and made speed and other tests with
it, the directors announce that they want still
another boat, and, after their experience of Aus-
tralian-built boats, there isn’t any doubt at all
that an Australian yard will get this job also.
An old-established Bulletin correspon-
dent at Kobe gives some interesting information
about the cheerful domestic habits of the dear
little Jap person :
The long procession of wives from Japanese homes goes
on all the time at the rate of 200 a day all the year round.
Nineteen per cent, of all Japanese marriag'es lead to
divorce ; and yet the husband is never divorced. No
ceremony, civil or religious, is necessary to seal the con-
jugal bond. Any couple may live together as man and
wife without molestation, and relinquish all ties at
pleasure or convenience. B it, if a legal union is desired,
all the couple has to do is to go to a police office and
register. By thus witnessing to the fact that the man
has taken a certain woman into his house as wife, a legal
marriage is effected. The police and the pair concerned
are sufficient witnesses to the event. The injustice to the
wife lies in the fact that, should she prove incompatible
or otherwise burdensome, relief may be had by striking
her name off the register as easily as it was placed there.
True, her consent is required, but no woman would dare
to refuse acquiescence if her lord demanded it. The
whole thing hinges on the kind of man the lord is. If he
is determined to free himself for another venture, the
law will find a way to support him, and the woman knows
there is no effective appeal. She might bring her case
into court if she had friends sufficiently powerful to sup-
port her, but, so far as one can find out, she does not do
so ; and this is amply significant as to the hopelessness of
this course as a means of redress.
There was a humorist loose in London last
month. The cable told at the time how, having
somehow got hold of a bank’s confidential cypher,
he sent forged letters of credit to all its suburban
branches, and the same morning ran round in a
swift motor and collected £290 in each of nine
places. What the cable did not tell was the
name he assumed. Any name would have done,
but this artist called himself Davitt Stanley
Winded, simply for the fun of signing “L. S.
Winded ”to every cheque he drew. A man who
could risk the success of a deep-laid plan for a joke
like that seems wasted on forgery. He recalls an
old Bulletin picture, of a land-agent showing his
doorplate to a friend, and complaining bitterly of
the awkwardness of the name—A. Swindell.
“Why not put your Christian name in full?’’
says the friend. “That would look worse,” he
groans. “ It’s Adam ! ”

Melbourne’s awful Harbor Trust, which
yearns to import everything, has decided to bring
a rock-breaker from abroad at a cost of £10,500
odd. It had an anxious time pushing the matter
through. First, two or three members said, in a
hesitating way, that perhaps the rock-breaker
could be made in Australia. Apparently it was
only a formal protest; they were assured that the
making of rock-breakers was quite impossible here,
and they quieted down. Then it was necessary to
get over the law, which says that no contract for the
purchase of over £lOO worth of material shall be
entered into until tenders have been advertised
for during a period of at least five days. It was
decided to ignore that; to advertise for tenders
locally would have revealed the fact that rock-
breakers can be made here by the dozen, and local
industry requires to be suppressed at any cost.
Then it was enthusiastically decided to send to
England for the rock-breaker, and the disease—
that is to say, the meeting—dispersed.

The Melbourne Christadelphian Ecclesia,
a branch of a queer, crazy, misfit sect, has pre-
sented a characteristic petition to Defence Minis-
ter Ewing, praying that its members be exempted
from compulsory military training. Its case is
set forth in weird language, studded with Biblical
references, thus: —
We are a community of religious people known
as Christadelphians (the Seed of Ahraham) who
have embraced the hope of Israel (Acts xxvi., 6;
Acts xxviii., 20), and have therefore dissociated
themselves from all political, and ecclesiastical
parties of the world (James iv., 4; 2 Cor. vi., 17)
and are waiting for the personal reappearance of
the Messiah of Israel (1 Thess. i., 10 ; Matt, xix., 28-29) to
set up a divine Politico-Ecclesiastical Government upon
Earth (Dan. ii., 44; Acts xv\, 16; Horn, xi., 26) which
shall overthrow all institutions and Governments existing
contemporaneously with His re-appearance, and bestow
an immortal nature upon such of IJis brethren
as He shall approve of, to qualify them for official
status in the Government (1 Cor. xv., 50;
Rev. ii., 26-27 ; Rev. xxii., 12). That during the
absence of the Messiah from the earth, your petitioners
are commanded by Him not to bear arms (Matt, xxVi.,
52; Rev. xiii., 10) in the service of any political or
ecclesiastical system now' extant, under pain of exclusion
from eternal life. . . . Your petitioners fully recognise His
other commandments to submit to the laws enacted by
the Governments under whose jurisdiction they may
happen to sojourn (Rom. xiii., 5-7 ; Peter ii., 13-15) when
these laws do not conflict with divine laws ; where they
do conflict, as they believe they do in the present cause
of petition, they believe that they are compelled to obey
God rather than man (Acts iv., 19 ; Acts v., 29).
It is logical in a sort of way, but there are five
points which the petitioners seemingly fail to con-
sider : (1) A savage invader is just as liable to
shoot a Christadelphian as anybody else;
(2) therefore other people must fight for the
Christadelphians; or else (3) let them be killed
with impunity ; and then (4) these other people
will have to bury the dead Christadelphians,
which is costly; or (5) let the dead Christadel-
phians lie around unburied, which is horrid. And
these matters are rather rough on the other people.
THE MALFEASANCE OF MURDOCH.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“My candid opinion, after carefully taking’ note of
what I saw in the East, in America, in the Old Country,
and in various parts of the Continent of Europe, is that
the best possible investment in the world to-day is real
estate in Australia.” This from Mr. J. A. Murdoch, the
well-known business man of Park-street, Sydney, who has
just returned from a trip round the world. —Sydney
Telegraph.
Hold, J. A. Murdoch ! Do I hear aright ?
(A merchant makes appeal)
Has Federation ceased to cast a blight
Upon the public weal ?
Is Private Enterprise no longer squelched
Throughout the Commonwealth?
Do you assert that landlords are not welshed
Publicly and by stealth ?
How of the Labor Curse ? Has it dropped dead ?
The Sosh that made Reid scream
With fear, and went to Gracie Watson’s head?
Was Sosh nought but a dream ?
Do you appreciate, when you compare,
The Cold Land with our own,
That Freetrade sheds its myriad blessings there
While tariffs weigh us down ?
Are you aware our capital departs
By millions in each ship
That sails (vide the press), racking our hearts,
And giving us the pip ?
Have you forgotten, in your wanderings,
The loom of Anarchy,
Which drives the Law away on shuddering wings,
And drowns it in the sea ?
Apparently you have. Yet, Ah !my Mur-
Doch, though you do that same,
Surely you see wherein you gravely err,
And earn a merchant’s blame?
Leave patriotism to the Labor man ;
It’s neither wise, nor well,
For us to paint our land as other than
Complete and utter H—l.

The WILD CAT
COLUMN
Twelve months ago Australian Treasury returns
were all pink, and most of the Treasurers acted as though
they were going to keep pink ; but already they wear
some streaks of blue. Smaller refunds of Customs from
the Commonwealth are partly responsible ; but there are
other troubles. Owing to the way N.S. W. slashed at the
stamp duties on the strength of its boom figures, stamp
collections in that State are £77,912 less this year than
they were last (for four months in each case) ; and there
are a multitude of other small skrinkages. The railway
boom has dried up in Victoria, owing to the poor
season in the North ; and that and the reduced
amount received back from the Commonwealth make
the Victorian figures look very sick. Queensland alone of
all the States shows better revenue figures all round.
Even in the matter of Commonwealth refunds it is over
£30,000 better this year than it was last year, and its rail-
way revenue is £lB,OOO better, though against that has
to be set an increase in the interest bill. Westralia has
already this year (four months) added no less than
£140,548 to its accumulated deficit ; and all that the
shocking drifter who is at the Treasury over there can say
by way of excuse is that, if other States had to make
regular additions to sinking funds like Westralia has to,
the other States would show deficits also instead of sur-
pluses. How that improves the position of Westralia
isn’t mentioned. The fact is that the foreign lender
has dropped to the fact that Westralia’s sinking fund
is a good deal of a fraud. First the State has a sink-
ing fund; then in providing for the sinking
fund it achieves a chronic deficit; and to make good the
deficit it has to borrow. Practically, therefore, its sink-
ing fund consists more or less of debt; and then it pro-
fesses to be quite surprised when Bull Cohen shuts down
and refuses to take up its new loans. It quite overlooks the
fact that its system of chronic deficits amounts to a confi-
dence trick worked on Bull Cohen, who could never have
suspected that his creditor would provide the required
sinking fund by borrowing more money on the same old
security.
Here, however, are the figures for the month
and the expired portion of the financial year :
State Revenue for October.

The only increase disclosed there is in the Queensland
figures ; and the Queensland revenue increase of £64,706
is sunk out of sight by an increase of no less than
£155,426 in the expenditure. Kidston’s financial policy
has been fairly satisfactory, though less satisfactory than
it looked on the surface, because, while professing
not to borrow, he arranged for the more rapid repay-
ment of money already borrowed and locked up
in the Q.N. Bank ; and, besides spending that money,
he has been handing out the country’s P.N.’s in connection
with the northern syndicate railways. Anything, how-
ever, may happen now to Kidston, though the thing
most likely to happen is the speedy burst-up of his coali-
tion with Philp. His new Ministry hasn’t satisfied any
party ; even among the Philpites there is already seething
discontent, and so far as the Labor party is concerned he
has, of course, burned his boats. Somehow Queensland
politicians have a fatal habit of letting themselves down
like that between two stools—Glassey, Drake, Dawson,
Kidston are only four out of many.
The only expenditure figures available'are these:
State Expenditure for Year so far.
1907. 1908.
N. S. Wales (4 mos,) £4,395,833 £4,866,688 Inc. £470,855
Queensland(4mos.) 861,554 1,016,980 Inc. 155,426
Westralia (4mos.) 1,031,883 1,072,869 Inc. - 40,986
S. Australia(3 mos.) 700,495 721,463 Inc. 20,968
In addition N. S. Wales spent £647,313, or at the rate of
(say) £2,000,000 a year, of borrowed money ; this is irre-
spective of the £367,979 charged to the Public Works
Fund—the fund that was going to do away more or less
with loans, but in practice is used largely for repairs,
renewals and things which shouldn’t be charged to loan
account in any case. The only other State which men-
tions loan expenditure is Queensland ; it spent £283,665
as against £329,913 the previous year, and in proportion
to population that was really a shade or two worse than
the N.S. W. record—the latter is at the rate of about
£1 ss. 6d. per head of population per year ; the Queens-
land loan expenditure is at the rate of about £1 10s. 3d.

This solid bank continues to show the very fine profits
which it has been disclosing during the past few terms.
With a business of this size any one half-year’s figures
must be taken as a mere indication of the results.
Figures in such a case (except as to liabilities, the amount
of the dividend and a few things of that definite sort)
cannot be absolute. There are advances totalling
£l6 283 507; and bad and doubtful debts are unavoid-
Securities must be constantly falling into the
bank’s hands; if none fall in to-day, the bank, with 74
years of Australian banking experience behind it, knows
that some will fall in to-morrow or the day after. If none
fall in to-day, a bank of this size and experience knows
that conditions must be unusually good, and will almost
inevitably be followed by some that are unusually bad, in
order to preserve the average ; therefore the profits of to-
day are being obtained at the expense of to-morrow, and a
bank that doesn’t live merely for to-day will make pro-
vision accordingly. There is no doubt that some of the
very fine profits which this bank has been able to show
lately have been due to the fact that some years ago it
wrote down its assets severely, and recently, having been
able to get rid of them, has shown large recoveries—that
is to say it has got more than it had written the pro-
perties down to. But as it has got money in it has lent
money out, so that it has taken a new set of risks ; and
only the future can say how they will turn out.
This comparison shows some of the recent
movements:—

The liabilities total £19,173,893, equal to £6 Is. for every
£1 of the shareholders’ own funds ; and of those lia-
bilities 31 per cent, is in liquid assets. This 31 per cent,
is less than this bank’s usual proportion ; but there has
been a pretty large demand for money lately, and the
bank has been able to meet it —which is where the bank
that “ runs strong ” in ordinary times has the advantage.
Profits calculated on the basis of capital and reserves
combined have lately been as follows :

These high figures are partly the result of severely writ-
ing down assets—the premises account, for instance.
That account will stand at £200,222 after the present
£20,000 is written off; yet 20 years ago, with fewer
branches and before most of its present offices in the
chief cities were built, the account stood at £380,219.

This co. had a bad time for many years. Formed in 1884
with a paid capital which was shortly raised from £25,000
to £30,000, it had to do something with the money
(the Government stock which it bought absorbed only
£10,000) ; and by 1888 it had put £35,000 into mortgages
and property. It was a shocking time to invest in either
mortgages or property in Melbourne, and presently the
co. was faced with a bad slump. To add to its misfor-
tunes it was struck by the Swan law-suit (it had miscal-
culated the powers of executors), and that cost another
£3563. For many years, therefore, dividends were
not declared, and they were only resumed in 1899.
Even now it is possible that the investments are over-
valued; thus the Government 3 per cent, stock is taken
in at par (£10,000). Still, though it is above its
market value, that entry may be defended, because the
asset is really an amount lodged for practically all time
by way of guarantee. Now, having after a long struggle
got things fairly well straightened up, the co. launches
out into £14,000 worth of office premises. This means a
mortgage of £5OOO, and another £3125 (cost of alterations)
has still to be provided for. This, of course, adds to the
co.’s risks. Later on, very likely, it may add something to
its profits; for there is no doubt that, if the co.
can get as good a return from office premises as
from mortgages, the office premises are the best
asset for a co. of this sort, for it can hang an
advertising signboard on , premises and it can’t
on a mortgage. The co. doesn’t mention the
size of the estates in hand ; probably they aggregate
about £2,250,000, judging by the income. They are not
large figures, considering the size of the capital; the
Perpetual of Sydney, on a capital of £25,000, has the
handling of £6,493,683 of estates. The Melbourne Per-
petual’s profits, therefore, are for a trustee co. compara-
tively poor, calculated on the basis of capital and reserves
combined—£B 7s. 3d. per cent, for last year. It would be
mighty good for almost any other business ; but, except
for guarantee purposes, a trustee co. doesn’t want any
capital, so the revenue from the invested capital is merely
so much extra to be added on to the ordinary trading
profit.

None of your “ Amicus certus in re incerta ” or other
Latin mottoes for this co. ; it hoists aloft the practical
words of William Shakspeare, deceased, “Let’s choose
executors and talk of wills ” ; and, talking of wills, it ■
mentions that its rates (like those of most other Aus-
tralian trustee cos.) are from 2£ per cent, down
to 1 per cent, on the capital value of the
estate (the 1 per cent, is when the estate is
worth £20,000 or more) and an annual per cent, on
income. Suppose the estate is worth £15,000 and brings
in 5 per cent. ; then, while it is in the co.’s hands to wind
up, the annual charge would be £lB 15s. and the single
charge on the capital would be £225. If the estate were
in hand for six years, the total amount drawn by the co.
would be £337 10s., equal to 2£ per cent, on the capital
value of the estate. This little Tasmanian co. has a paid
capital of £lO,OOO (£5 shares paid to £1); on capital and
reserves combined last half-year’s profits were at the rate
of £lO ss. per cent, per annum—an excellent return, as
the returns from practically all trustee cos. are. The
funds are invested with the Treasurer (£5000) and on
mortgage (£11,620) ; and the return from those sources
pays four-fifths of the dividend.

Term after term this co., which has some very solid
backing behind it, has announced only a few hundred
pounds more than was necessary to provide the dividend ;
but now the amount added to reserves jumps up to over
£2OOO. Of course that may mean nothing ; on the other
hand, it may be a hint that, if matters go along all right,
something more than the already very substantial 10 per
cent. div. is coming. One of the weak features about the
investment is the unknown amount of paper assets. The
biggest item in the balance-sheet is “ Stock on hand,
plant and fixtures, patent rights, etc.,” and “ etc.” pro-
bably means goodwill. Down to 1904 goodwill used to
get a half-yearly mention—“ After making provision for
depreciation, and writing down patent rights, goodwill,
etc.,” the balance of profit was so and so. But “good-
will ” hasn’t been mentioned since 1904—it has been
“ etc.” since then. This composite item has, however,
been reduced very much during the past few years. At
August, 1904, it stood at £98,178 ; it is now £77,770 ; but
that may be due merely to the reduction of stock. On
the other hand, it may be due to profits being applied to
the writing down of the paper assets—patent rights,
goodwill, etc. Patent rights are risky assets; some
absurd person is always happening along and inventing
something better ; so if this paper asset is not being
written down steadily there may be trouble ahead. As a
matter of fact, therefore, the published accounts show
little of the real inwardness of the business. The directors
may have been writing little off risky assets, or they may
have been writing off a great deal- —more even than the
reduction mentioned above suggests, because they may
have been paying for new patents as they went along.
The facts, about which there can be no doubt, are that
a steady 10 per cent. div. has been paid, notwith-
standing which, in four years, £7500 has been put into
freehold premises, while a £5265 excess of liabilities
over liquid assets has been turned into a £9165 surplus
of liquid assets over liabilities. Further, there is nowa-
days a new item, “W. H. Soul, Pattinson and Co. (New-
castle) shares, £3596”; but they may be worth much or
little. Discarding that, the situation as'to liquid assets
is £14,430 better in four years, with the £7500 of freehold
to the good. But how much of all that is due to the
reduction of stock and how much to surplus profit the
accounts don’t show.

There is a mournful look about that. And yet it was not
always so. Forty years ago the society was formed ; and
going back just half-way, to 1888, we meet a cheerful lot
of shareholders coming out of the doorway with a 15 per
cent, dividend in one hand and a 20 per cent, bonus in
the other. (The capital had been £40,000 in £25 shares ;
£BOOO was added to capital, and the £25 share was ex-
changed for six £5 shares.) The end came in 1893, when
an 8 per cent, dividend was paid. The advances and
properties at that time were £153,393—but here’s the
whole pilgrim’s progress from that point: —

The “advances, etc.,” are of course nowadays mostly
properties in possession ; the advances alone reach only
£7264. So in 15 years £139,990 of “ advances, etc.,” have
paid off £65,521 of debt, with the help of £749 of cash and
other assets. Recent progress has been almost ghastly :

Certainly there has been an increase of cash in hand in
the past year, as shown above. In the four years £26,669
(book value) of assets have gone, and only £11,906 of debt
has been paid off. There is still £33,031 of debt and
about £45,000 (book value) of assets ; and management
always costs something more than the revenue from pro-
perties, etc., so that all that the assets realise won’t be
available. Since the trouble broke, the depositors have
received 7s. 6d. in the £, including 6d. after the last
accounts were made up. As for the balance, here’s a propor-
tion sum : If in the past eight years £42,726.0f assets have
paid off £19,765 of debt, how much debt will £45,452, of
assets pay off ? The Bulletin gives it up. *

For years the paid capital stood at £15,000; it has now
been increased by the issue of new shares to £17,500—105.
shares paid, with a further liability of 10s. At the
same time deposits have been increased a trifle. A

The advances are apparently mostly on mortgage ; and,
as the proportion of borrowed money in the business is
small—little more than 10s. 6d. to every £1 of the co.’s
own funds—the profits are naturally not very glittering.
Further, it is a little concern, and the expenses are
necessarily rather high in proportion to advances. It
ought to be possible to do considerably more business at
practically no greater expense. Hence the increase of
capital is a good move : presumably also it will be accom-
panied by an increase in #

It has been assumed that the usual bonus to staff will be
paid ; £l3O has been deducted from profits to provide for
this. An item appears in the balance-sheet, “ Goodwill
and preliminary expenses, North-west Coast, £956.”
This is apparently a business extension account; in the
foregoing table it has been deducted from profits, which
otherwise would have amounted to £3223, or about the
same as in recent years. The directors themselves,
though they don’t cha'rge this outlay up to working ex-
penses, do the next best thing, and appropriate enough
out of profits to write the paper asset off. The co.'s turn-
over has grown very largely in the last eight years.
In 1900 the commissions amounted to £3256 ; by
1905 they were £6903, at about which figure they
stood for a couple of years ; in the past year they
were £9098. Expenses • have, however, had a dis-
proportionate increase; but it has .yet to be seen
whether that increase of expenses will be maintained,
once the extended business gets into its swing. The co.
has certainly added considerably to its risks. Twelve
months the “ advances and accounts owing” were
£17,977 ; and they are now £27,368. Besides, there has
been a increase in stocks held. To finance this the
co’s credit bank balance of £598 has been turned into an
overdraft of £9430, and other liabilities have been in-
creased from £11,655 to £16,604. The business has
hitherto been highly profitable ; but it looks as though,
on account of the extensions, the past is no sure guide to
the future. „

This co. was formed to take over the assets of an older
co., consisting mainly of some city “'model lodging-
house ” property ; the capital is in 18,200 shares paid to
17s. and liable for another 3s. At the end of the first year
there was a mortgage of £9009. an overdraft of
£°sB3 and other debts £l7B in excess of liquid
assets At September 30 last the mortgage was down
to £B5OO, the overdraft was £321, and the other debts
£I3S in excess of liquid assets. Liabilities have thus been
reduced by £2802 in four years. It is very fair progress ;
still, before the dividend was put up to 10 per cent.,
something more than £5OO might very well haw come off
the mortgage. Nothing has been written off freehold
property (£26,300), and fittings and furniture remain at
the same £lOOO. The directors, however, make an annual
claim that the amount spent on furniture renewals (about
£150) “fully covers any depreciation that has taken
place”; and unless an investor is prepared to go along,
and count the chair-legs for himself, and personally in-
spect the crockery, he will have to take their word for
that.

This co-operative co. was put upon a new basis in 1903 ;
prior to that time bonuses had been paid and charged
direct to Profit and Loss account, and generally the ar-
rangements were unsatisfactory. Things are much better
nowadays, and the accounts are very well presented.
Profit has been rather less in the past six months than it
was in either term of the previous year ; gross profit on
turnover has been rather less, and the expenses have
moved up. Expenses are, however, distinctly moderate
—presuming that everything is charged up to expenses,
and nothing is deducted from “gross profits. _ ln the
Sydney Civil Service Co-operative Society the working ex-
penses last half-year were at the rate of 14'86 per cent, on a
turnover (cash receipts) of £115,130 ; in the Brisbane so-
ciety working expenses were 14'6 per cent, on a turnover of
£17,521. Still it is possible that the same basis is not
adopted in each case : for instance, some expenses might
be added to the cost price of the goods in one case, thus
reducing the so-called “ gross profit,” while in the other
case they might be charged up with ordinary trade ex-
penses. The co. has a paid capital of £4956, and its total
liabilities on July 31 were £3331. The overdraft (included
in that) was £1075 ; but as the interest bill for the half-year
was only £l, apparently this was very temporary accom-
modation. Book debts amount to £3oBB—more than they
ought to be in a co-op. society of this size ; but the total
is not getting any larger: July, 1907, £3115; January,
190 S £3197 ; July, 1908, £3OBB. Stock is valued at £6982
or over 60 per cent, of all the assets ; so a great deal
depends upon the way that it is valued, and as to that,
of course, one can tell nothing from published accounts.
Still, the management looks prudent.

Thisco. is practically having its second time on earth.
It worked out one of the oldest mines at Newcastle, and
with deplorable improvidence put aside nothing to buy
a new one with. Still, it had a good plant-including
some trucks, though not enough—so it got a leasehold at
South Maitland, and hurried on with the development of
a new mine, the Neath. Luck favored it, and already it
has achieved an output of 74,500 tons in the past half-
year. As plant has been dismantled, it has been written
down ; the amounts, along with the sums spent on de-
veloping Neath, are shown above. The development of
Neath started in 1905, and the co. has done extra-
ordinarily well to bring the mine to its present stage
of production. On March 31 1905, just before
the new lease was acquired, and when a winding-up
petition had actually been presented, the paid capital
was £104,370; the liquid assets in excess of liabilities
were £1749. Now the capital is £108,248, artd the liabili-
ties are £13,35S in excess of liquid assets ; so the new
leasehold has been acquired, more plant added, and a
branch railway (£3000) putin at a cost of £17,236, plus,
of course, the profit on the coal sold during the period.
There are 70,000 old shares fully paid to £l, 20,000 1-i per
cent. pref. shares fully paid to £l, and 20,000 new shares
paid tb 18s. The sort of recovery Wickham and Bullock
Island has had may be further judged by the fact that in
January, 1905, old ordinary shares were worth 10 pence,
and pref. shares ss. 6d. ; the former are now quoted at
about 65., and the others at 245.

The old Sydney Mercantile Provident Associa-
tion came to life again the other day. In 1881 a number
of clerks and such like in the warehouses formed a benefit
societv. It went up like a rocket, and a large sum of
money was raised. In 1888 it came down like the stick,
and was left with over £lOOO and no members. No one
turned up at the meetings because no one ever called
them. The terms of the office-bearers expired an i
nothing tangible existed except the sum of £1043. So in
1897 the Equity Court appointed trustees. It cost £l/4
in law expenses apparently to appoint the trustees, for
the trustees found themselves with £869. This was 11
years ago. Since then, the association has bought one
pair of blankets at a guinea, and the interest on the funds
is-steadily mounting up. The three trustees can t find
the association, and: sick of the whole thing, they again
came before the Equity Court to get the money dis-
tributed. The Judge refused to make this order until he
o-ot the consent of all the persons having a claim on the
funds but the trustees don’t know who are the claimants
from a packet of crackers. Their one fragment of joy is
that good old Costs will make a tidy hole in the money,
and, if the worst comes to the worst, they can go to La
until Costs own the whole lot.

In the calculation of working costs in concen-
trating mills and workshops, every small item should be
taken into consideration. It is the small and uncon-
sidered factors, involving waste of power, that make for
high working costs. The type of bearing employed has a
marked effect, on the power consumed in overcoming
friction. Recent exhaustive tests emphasised the marked
superiority of the Hyatt Flexible Roller. Bearings over all
other types of roller, sleeve, and - other anti-friction
bearings. Under equal conditions the loss of power due
to friction in Hyatt Flexibles is 23 per cent, less than
with the best solid roller bearing, and 65 per cent, less
that pith babbit metal journals. Messrs. W. and J.
Lempriere, 506 Little Collins Street, Melbourne, will be
glad to supply further information to those interested.*

All philosophic works, and Holy Writ itself,
teem with warning of the uncertainty of life. Deaths by
natural causes have been pushed far down the years of
civilised life, but with the increase of that very civilisa-
tion the liability to accident has enormously increased.
The railway, the ferry, the tram, and the murderous
motor car inevitably cause thousands of people to place
their lives and limbs in the hands of entire strangers, of
whose ability they can have absolutely no knowledge. It
would seem, therefore, to be only common-sense to guard
against the financial consequences of misadventure by
taking out an accident and sickness policy with the South

seasons and bad. A Sydney speculator secured an option
on a Central Queensland estate. He paid no cash, but
proceeds now to float a co. im 10,000 shares to provide the
purchase money ; and of the 10,000 shares the promoters
take 2000 “ f?i consideration of the transfer to the co. of
their rights in the purchase of the estate without any in-
crease in price.’’ First, then, there is the present holder.
He sells for, say, £7500. Then the speculator comes
along, gets an option, floats a co. with a capital of
£lO,OOO, collars £2OOO worth of the shares, and vises £5OO
(or thereabouts) to pay expenses of flotation ; so that the
men who purchase are expected to provide profits on a
capital of £lO,OOO, or 33 1-3 per cent, more than the sum
paid to the owner of the estate. Nor is this the worst
case either—it is merely the latest. Three or four sub-
divisionists have notoriously made fortuhes out of the
business. And still the yarn goes round that there is no
reason for the State to come into the land-repurchase
business at all—that the private subdivisionist fills the
bill entirely.

The British Broken Hill people cable out from
London that the accounts for the half-year from January
to June showed a net loss of £19,989, covering deprecia-
tion, development and plant renewals. Papers, which
ought to know better and probably do, refer to this as
showing the need for a reduction in wages at Broken
Hill. The figures really show nothing one way or the
other. , The British shut down its mill just before Christ-
mas, and all it has done since has been to prepare the
mine for ore-extraction under more favorable metal
market conditions; wherefore practically no revenue
has come in during the term.

The Zinc Corporation has now got fairly into
its stride at the works at Broken Hill, and begins to see
daylight ahead. In the past three months, reckoning
spelter at £l9 ss. per ton, which is 16s. or so under the
market average for the past nine months, it is officially
estimated that the income and expenditure have run
like this:
Aug. Sept. Oct. Total.
Income .. .. £16,714 £17,645 £15,636 £49,995
Expenditure .. 7,466 7,949 7,060 22,475
Surplus .. £9,248 £9,696 £8,576 £27,520
Then there are two other items. Capital expenditure
totals £9,440. Presumably depreciation is not reckoned
in with working expenditure, so that half at least of the
capital expenditure ought to be counted in with costs.
Also there is the cost of the tailings. The total quantity
treated in the three months was 47,800 tons. Average
these at 4s. =£9560. Add half the amount spent on con-
struction to cover wear and tear, £4720; total for the
two items, £14,280. This would deduce the surplus on
the three months’ work to £13,240, or at the rate of
£52,960 per annum. Out of that management expenses
have to come. The chief trouble is the shocking size of
capital £555,213 at the date of the last balance-sheet
(f ebruary 29, 1908). Still, accepting the official figures
in the progress reports, which, of course, are all more or
less estimates, the co.’s recovery has been remarkable.

South Blocks, Broken Hill, has got on to the
lode at what is generally called the 600 ft. level (No. 4):
the depth is really 530tt. below the collar of the new main
shaft. The size remains to be proved ; but the stuff is
about the same value as that in the upper levels—lS& per
cent, lead and 3£oz. silver j and it is of good milling cha-
racter. From the look of things higher up there ought
to be a 20ft. lode here; if there is, in view of its low
working costs South Blocks 00. is in for a pretty good
time. It owns the nearest approach to a virgin mine at
Broken Hill; only during the last 12 months has any
regular ore extraction been done.

Code’s Creek (N.S.W.), which paid 3s. 6d. a
share in the two tin-boom years, is back again to the
stage at which “ the directors regret that the operations
for the past half-year show a loss.” It wasn’t much of a
loss ; charging everything up to profit and loss, including
some small additions to plant, the total was £742.
Luckily for the co., it kept a bit in hand out of the boom
profits, and still has £l6OO on fixed deposit; and with
better dirt ahead this half-year should be passed without
disturbing the nest-egg.

Mills’ United, Charters Towers, closed its half-
year with a net profit of £45,482, of which £30,000 went
in dividends. This came from 22,751 tons of stone re-
turning gold worth £91,460. Reckoning the market
value of the mine at £200,000, the directors seem a provi-
dent lot to keep £51,870 in reserve. It is not often a
Queensland mine holds 25 per cent, of its market value
in cash. There is good reason, though, for this prudence
Exploratory work in the deep ground has been dis-
appointing, and the mine is being drawn on at the rate
of 3300 tons a month. What is going to happen below
No. 13 at 2200 ft. vertical is so far, of course, unknown ;
there were occasional patches of good stone in this level’
which has still 500 ft. to go to the N. B. Freehold boun-
dary. Bad ventilation caused much trouble, so a rise has
been started 750 ft. along No. 13 level; this will not only
improve the air, but will prospect intermediate ground.
Some of the directors are heavy holders, have taken a
fortune out of the mine, and believe firmly in it; so there
is to be no lack of pluck in sinking the underlie and open-
ing No. 14 level. It is not a crowd to throw up the sponge
in a hurry.
A poor crushing accounted for slackness in New
Brilliant Freehold shares, Charters Towers, but favorable
mine reports caused a recovery. No. 7 footwall level is
nearly halfway across the lease, and the last return of
only a few shillings a ton from a mixture of quartz and
diorite was a big slump from the good yields of a while
back. The return from No. 8 only added to the gloom ;
132 tons from the level for £2OB, and 79 tons from the rise
for £l3O, was not cheerful. The redeeming feature was
a return of £5lB from 169 tons of stone got in driving No.
7 hangingwall level. No. 6 hanging wall level has also
prospected well, and a crushing from here will probably
be the next announcement. These two hanging wall
levels have been driven nearly 100 ft. from the boundary.
A crushing that includes exceptionally poor or excep-
tionally rich stone is misleading ; but averaging the lot
it will be found that 481 tons of N. B. Freehold stone
from four sections of the mine gave only £1 17s. 8d; per
ton, which is very different from the £5 a ton obtained
in driving the first 400 ft along No. 7 level.

Carrington United, outside Charters Towers,
had another meeting the other day. Practically it de-
cided to make the best of a bad job. The recently
reported deal with Southern people could not be arranged
satisfactorily, so the co. is grubbing along, trying to
reduce its liability of £5BOO. Against this there is some-
thing like £2lOO of unpaid calls, together with a surplus
due on the sale of 60 tons blister copper, which would
probably be under 10 per cent, of its value. The gold
ores are being worked at a small profit ; but unless the
copper market continues to jump, thus making it pos-
sible for the crude treatment of copper ores to show a
profit, the badly-handled Carrington United has a weary
struggle ahead.
Mount Oxide, midway between Clencurry and
the Gulf (Q.), is declared to be the aristocrat of the dis-
covered copper lodes of that part. The mine is owned by
E. Henry, the discoverer of Cloncurry, who has hope-
fully hung’ on to that part for half a century. The main
shaft is down 110 ft. In the sink they have followed the
rich shoot. Three men are raising 70 tons of the richest
stuff every fortnight, worth £2O per ton net. The ore is
so clean that no picking is required. A quick and cheaper
mode of transit than teams is the thing most badly
needed. Henry says that the Burketown-Lilydale line
would take in a great helt of mineral country. The
Leichhardt district and the area stretching away to Lawn
Hills is equal, he declares, to any other part of ’Curry,
although up to date it has been barely prospected.

Anderson’s Surprise, which was always looked
upon as the best surface show’ outside the big mine at
O.K. (North Queensland), has been shut down for a good
many months awaiting a settlement of the trouble
between E. B. Torpy and Abdul Wade, the latter’s shares
in the syndicate having been forfeited for alleged non-
payment of calls. Wade objected to the forfeiture and
went for Torpy, who has at last agreed to settle the
matter in the Afghan’s favor and end the hang-up. Steps
will be taken to start work on the property, where a large
body of good ore is waiting at 100 ft.

Re the attempts to save, by selection, the
minute quantities of gold in O.K. ore (Q.). Last week it
was mentioned that in some recent experiments the gold
had been concentrated up to 60oz. per ton of copper.
This should, of course, be 6oz.

The pick of the smaller copper shows which
were considered a certain source of supply for the Mount
Molloy smelters (Q.)—the New Anniversary, at Herberton
—has changed its plans, and the ore goes to Mount
Perry ; a first lot of 30 tons is now on the way. The
Q. 0.0., which owns Mount Perry, is generally supposed to
have secured an option over this excellent little mine.

Some Townsville (Q.) folk (with E. D. Miles
and Robt. Philp in to give it “tone”) have formed a co. of
50,000 ss. shares to open up the Argentine district, 50
miles from Townsville. A fair amount of alluvial gold
has been found there, and they hope to find a lode.
King Solomon’s Mines they call it.

T. T. Opie, Macarthur’s late representative at
the Mitchell River gold-antimony mines (Q.), wants to
put himself right with the shareholders. This is why he
resigned, he says: South tunnel, no ore ; south drive,
no ore ; north drive, no ore ; Macarthur’s tunnel, no ore.
Under the circumstances he did not feel justified in ex-
perimenting with ore from a mine that was doomed, and
take the risk of having his principals’ process blamed for
the failure. The value of the prospectus as a source of
information is commented on rather cruelly. The main
crosscut at 76ft. was alleged to have 14ft. of ore. In
March Opie declared there was only Ift. of ore. Ore in
sight, according to the prospectus, was 12,850 tons ;
Opie declares that the reserves were practically nil;
and in May, after four months’ development, he
reported only 800 tons. The prospectus alleged that the
gold value was loz. 3dwt.; Opie puts it at 9dwt. 17gr.,
with a proportional difference in antimony. The pros-
pectus estimated a profit ahead of £196,620 ; Opie can’t
see more than £2529. It is said that MacArthurs will
send out another expert provided expenses are put up,
but faith in this show has had such a rude shock that
more money isn’t likely to be available to try it.
* * * •
What shall take its place hasn’t yet been
decided on ; but after the second disastrous cave-in at
Mount Morgan the attempt to work the gold-copper
deposit on the underground open-cut and pig-sty system
was doomed. The Mount Morgan management has
always had a very fair name among its workmen, and its
chief officers have personally been most considerate ; so
that, the present system having demonstrated its own
unfitness, no great trouble should be met in securing a
better one. Inevitably the better system will mean a
larger expenditure on timber, partly because more
of it will be lost; but it is better to lose
timber than lives. Unfortunately a dozen men have
been killed in two months. General-manager Richard
is reported to have told the men who have seen
him with regard to a change of methods that “the co.
would far rather have foregone its dividends for many
years than had the catastrophes.” After that it was
announced, apparently as proof of the co.’s generosity,
that “ the full measure of compensation in each case, viz.,’
£4OO, will be paid.” Well, as the co. would rather have
foregone its profits than have had the catastrophes, but
as it had the catastrophes and didn’t forego the profits
suppose the shareholders who have pocketed the profits
(which the co. would rather not have made) return some
of the money to the families of the victims. It seems the
very least they can do—unless they think a poor little
£4OO is full compensation to a family for the loss of its
breadwinner.

Though 8., M. and Co. are satisfied enough
with the look of things at Great Pitzroy (Q.) to proceed
with the erection of a much bigger smelter plant, the

Fitzroy, when it gets the new plant, will, it is said, do a
bit of ore-buying. Which suggests that it is in much
the same condition as the Broken Hill Prop.—it probably
sees that the mine isn’t big enough of itself to carry the
over-big capital of the co.
* * * *
Out of its first crushing the Tommy Burns Tin
Co. (N.Q.), floated only the other day, paid a div. of £1
per share. This was “ putting on dog” with a vengeance.
The co. has no paid capital worth mentioning to develop
the mine with, and the money got from skimming the
cream ought to have been saved up. Somebody has all
along seemed desperately anxious to make a market in
T. Burns shares—and presumably do a bit of unloading
on to the guileless southerner.

Golden Pole’s half-yearly report did not reach
London until a day or two before the date fixed for the
meeting, whereupon a financial paper there fumed at its
late arrival, and said that such treatment was enough to
put investors off colonially controlled concerns. But as
reports of London-managed concerns do not usually
reach Australian shareholders until weeks after the
meeting has been held, it is patent that things are
infinitely worse managed by J. Bull. Wherefore it is up
to J. Bull to put his own backyard in order before com-
plaining about the state of anyone else’s front garden.

The first clean-up from the mostly Sydney-owned
Karangahake (W.A.) shows £2 13s. 3d. per ton for 950
tons, with 4£dwt. in the tailings. But, though there
would be a first-rate profit in this, the result leaves the
value of the mine still unsettled, for it is honestly ad-
mitted that the stuff put through was better than the
mine average. Not enough development work has, how-
ever, been done to allow of a fair sample being sent to the
mill at a reasonable cost.
“Reval,” from Laverton (W.A.): Some new
finds are reported in the Gregory Hills and Cosmo New-
bery Ranges country, beyond here, which Oarr-Boyd
has been booming- for years. On the Green and Gold,
Gregory Hills, previously worked by Duploek and
Meagher, a reef, said to be worth 2oz. sdwt., has been
found by Angus Campbell, who intends to put a
crushing through at Erlistoun. He was here yesterday,
and I have no doubt he is on a very fair surface show.
Of the Cosmo Newbery show, Carr-Boyd says it will prove
richer than Burtville (18 miles from here) ; and Burtville
was a network of good leaders. But better wait and see.

Perth papers announce that the graphite de-
posits near Bridgetown (W.A.) are being reopened on be-
half of an eastern syndicate, and that a bulk sample of
five tons is being sent to Melbourne for testing purposes.
Representatives of the syndicate report that “ a cheap
and efficacious method to eliminate the deleterious pro-
perties in the graphite, which have so far rendered it
unmarketable, has been discovered,” and they assure
shareholders that no fear need be entertained as to the
extent of the deposits, as “ hundreds of thousands of
tons ” are insight. Just so ; but is there any money in
the business ? Local opinion reckons there is not.

Walhalla (Vic.) has been talking like an in-
furiated ox-persuader at Rowe, of the LongXunnel. Not
that one doesn’t often want to throw a brick after a spell
of Rowe’s eloquence ; but the little man should not be
slanged merely because Walhalla wants more divs. and
more share booming. Belonging to an anti-boom school,
Rowe won’t shell out profits merely to hit the popular
taste. Besides, he is as fond of new plant as he is
of speech, so a few thousands have yet to flow
out before all old stuff is scrapped. As the co.
has got into the north-west ground, Walhalla thinks
there’s 150,000 tons of stone to break, whereas 50,000
would cover the lot. The Argus can’t leave off pap-
feeding the co., so it chirrups out chat there is 900 ft. of
stone from the 3000 ft. crosscut to 2100 ft. Any infant can
figure out that the two levels are 900 ft. apart, but if the
hundred-eyed had all its peepers merged into one it could
not even then be sure that the lode lives continuously from
2100 ft. to 3000 ft. ; much less, if it does, that the gold con-
tents carry.

“ Tin in the Gunyah district ” is the big-letter
heading given to a screed in the Age over some tin-drift
found out Boolarra way. The public is told that the
granite has been “ heaved ”by volcanic action. All The
Bulletin can say is that it would like to see that dear old
plutonic rock so shifted and crumpled ; also, to learn
what particular connection that phenomenon has with
the hard cementy wash found carrying the tin. The
pegging out of 2000 acres tells of another kind of heave
—with the profit (if any) towards the market-swells of
Melbourne.

West Berry Consols, Creswick (Vic.), having
spent more money than if it had done five years’ Cup
punting, wants to sweat out some cash at the expense of
the miners. Hence the idea to return to contracting and
cut-throat work. But the miner isn’t taking any of that.
His ballot may stop the wheels going round, but that will
be better than sweating him to carry on a mining dis-
appointment.

A choice lot of Bendigo woebegones have met
Minister McLeod and solemnly shivered over the deep
mines. There were the two Lansells, Mueller, Dyason,
Sam McGowan, Hr. Boyd, and Angas Macltay—a little
crowd with many a penny to cut up among them. Still,
as the State has £lOO,OOO to spill about, Bendigo wants
a bit to carry down the New Chum Railway deep shaft.
“Geology” Dunn aids and abets, because he cannot get
it Into his head that gold peters out at depth. So on the
“help those who help themselves” plan, McLeod will
give £ for £ to the New Chum, probably for another
600 ft. of sinking. This will put the shaft down close to
5000 ft.

Wallaroo (S.A.) smelted 7750 tons of charge
for October, including 6260 tons of ore. The matte was
in the vicinity of 50 per cent., and contained approxi-
mately 684 tons fine copper. The furnace was in blast
29 days, and, including delays, averaged each day 6'7
tons per square foot of hearth area. This is probably
Wallaroo’s best effort, but yet it is not the limit for this size
of furnace. The tonnages are dazzling when compared with
the capabilities of the old plant, with its innumerable
crushers, calciners, and inefficient reverberatory reducers.
It would have taken them about seven weeks to wobble
through the task above specified—providing their luck
was in. If their luck was out it might have taken them
from now to the site of the Federal capital.

Mt. Cleveland (Tas.), boomed 18 months ago as
another Mt. Bischoff, is in trouble, and has drifted into
debt to the extent of £2BOO. At the outset they
used to talk of 15 tb 20 per cent, tin stone. Twelve
months ago The Bulletin remarked that the reports
were getting a bit more indefinite ; the manager talked of
“ highly payable” stuff, and “very highly payable tin,”
and “ very rich stuff.” Then a mill was put up, and 550
tons gave 12 tons in six weeks; and now, as the hifalutin
can’t be continued in the face of that testimony, the talk
is of 3 per cent, stone, which has a habit of sliding down
to 2 per cent., while, apparently to prepare shareholders
for the worst, it is mentioned that 1 per cent, will pay
very well. It possibly will—if work is done economically
(it hasn’t been so far), and if tin keeps over £l2O, which
it probably won’t. Anyway, if it does keep at over £l2O,
all past experience will count for nothing.

The White Cliffs Opal Co.’s leases, plant, etc.

other day ; and there wasn’t a serious bid for the whole
turn-out, unless a daring speculator’s £lOO can be re-
garded as serious. There certainly is not much in the
disastrous history of the co. to induce competition. On
the strength of big profits made by the original owners of
the blocks, this J. Bull co. was formed; but there is no
record of a dividend. Somehow gems didn’t reach the
co. in any large quantity. The same morning that the
White Cliffs property wasn’t sold, Sully’s cyanide works

alluvial men are now looking for work on wages without
finding a clue as to its whereabouts, while a few dredge
owners are trying to get a bit of their money back by
sluicing ground from which the best of the tin has already
been won. The Cornwall and South Cornwall leases are
both idle, and at present there isn’t much inducement for
capital to exploit the Greenbushes lodes at depth. About
half the shops in the township are empty, and the occu-

With the close of the present year the A.M.P.
Society will attain its Diamond Jubilee, and, in accordance
with its time honored custom, will, as usual, distribute
among the members the profit earned during the year.
It would, therefore, be most fitting if the accession of
■new members to participate in the year’s bonus establishes
a record in its history. In our advertising columns an
announcement is made that every participating policy in
the Ordinary department taken out before the year closes
will share in the bonus to be divided as the result of this
years’ operations. What this may mean can be gathered
from the fact that for 1907, £708,245 was distributed by
way of a cash bonus among the policy-holders, but, as
some evidence of the wonderful bonus-producing' power
of this well-known institution, we might mention-this sum
was equal to more than a third of the total premiums re-
ceived by the Society during the year. The aggregate
cash bonuses divided by the Society since its inception
reaches £13,596,507. Intending assurers should there-
fore, not hesitate to take the earliest steps to qualify for

ABORIGIN-
ALITIES
The moral of the latest treasure-hunting
expedition is that, when burying valuables, you
should select a place where earthquakes are not;
also that the custodian of the treasure should
refrain from dynamite-fishing. Away back in
1878, a mariner alleged that he went to live
amongst the natives at Sio Harbor, Malaita.
He said he helped a chief named Ene-Ene in some
inter-tribal row, and the grateful savage, by way
of return, told him that he had a quantity of
gold buried near the shore. The mariner de-
clared that he secured a little of the wealth, and
brought it back to Sydney. Here, as the theatre
programme airily remarks, twenty-seven years
elapsed—or, as the poet puts it, Time rolled on.
A great roller is Time. The mariner apparently
let the years go flitting by in a long procession,
until about 1905, when he announces that he
returned to the island and made arrangements for
gathering up the affluence. However* it was not
until August this year that the schooner Wheat-
sheaf, with the treasure-seekers aboard, sailed out
of Sydney Heads. It left a wake of golden
rumors behind, but when it arrived at the island,
the boss mariner said he found that things were
changed. An earthquake had so shaken up the
gold that Ene-Ene had become alarmed about its
safety, and had dug it up and re-buried it. He
told nobody where the new burial place was
located, and when the dynamite blew up while
Ene-Twice was out fishing, he carried his secret
up with him and came down dead. So the trea-
sure expedition poked about for a while at ran-
dom, asked questions of niggers who could give no
information, and then started disgustedly and
cursefully for home. The barrels it took with it
to pack the gold in are now for sale at a consider-
able reduction. Also it has doubts about its
mariner.

"“Adelaide” : The frequent recent wom-
bat stories unite in not taking the beast seriously.
Can you fancy him as a bringer of death? At
Quorn (S.A.) about seven years ago, a young girl,
out cycling in the late evening, was suddenly
thrown, and was dead when picked up. The
machine was found with a mangled wombat,
mixed up in the spokes. Womby had been moon-
ing around in the dark, and had somehow blun-
dered into the middle of the passing machine,
with results that were fatal all round, for the girl
was dead, the wombat was deceased, and the bike
looked as if it had been ravaged by the Vandal
hordes.
“ Archibald Augustus ” : Without any
desire to assist “Machete” in his foul effort to
promote a Most Unnatural Lie contest, I can
tell of a happening that beats his (B.
8/10/’08) out of sight. One squally even-
ing a disreputable fishing vessel, smeared
and stained with greasy bonita blood,
creek slime, scales, etc., battled its
way outward from Mordialloc (Vic.),
under a rusty-hued mainsheet bearing
an advt. for Slop’s Soap. “Mucker”
Pearo, an ancient, dirty and alcoholic
Greek, was the navigating officer. He
dropped anchor close in and proceeded
to steal flathead off the sea-bottom.
Shortly after sunset, gusts of beery
profanity were borne inward on the
chill breeze, and eventually Mucker re-
turned with no fish and no anchor
(valued at 255.). For three days there-
after he abandoned toil and drifted
about, peering into the cool, green
depths in quest of his anchor. But in
vain. And it came to pass that on the
fourth day Aubrey Oswald and Randolph
Reginald, two bank clerks from the local
coffee-palace, hired a boat and went forth
for a morning’s fishing. They anchored
within 75yds. of the local pier. Having
severely soaked certain worms for about
43 seconds, without any result, Aubrey
Oswald suggested a move. Randolph Reginald
arose and hauled manfully at the anchor.
The veins stood out on his fair young brow.
The perspiration streamed. The floor of Aus-
tralia seemed attached to the end of the rope he
was handling. When at last the iron appeared
above the bows, both Aubrey and Randolph cried
aloud with wonder. The fluke of their anchor
had hooked on to and recovered the Greek’s lost
ironmongery. Even people who had never seen
the Dago’s lost anchor recognised it by the smell
of beer that clung to it like a brother.
Ex-Justice J. P. Boucaut winds up the
controversy re the Arab horse and the legs of
him :
Mr. Harry Stoekdale wrote you (3/9/’08) that the “ en-
vironment ’’of the Arab horse has for 1400 or 1500 years
been flat sandy country. I said (24/9/’08) that that was
misleading. , Mr. Stoekdale replied (15/10/’08) that he had
said that the Arab horse had lived ” for that time in
flat sandy country. But he did not in his earlier letter
(3/9/’08) speak of where the Arab horse “ lived,” but of his
“ environment,” in order to show that Mr. Harry Dawson,
whom he quotes, might be right in saying that the
Arab’s leg-s were bad, the argument plainly being that the
Arab was a creature used only to sand, and therefore not
to be expected to keep on his feet in hilly country.
It is unimportant to discuss the locality of where he
lived if his environment be hilly country, and it is not
very material to discuss even his environment if he be
used to travel in hilly country ; so I will only point out
that his “environment” is not where he lives, and
“ where he lives ” is not his environment, my main point
being that his legs are not bad legs but good legs—the
best in the world. And as I desire no dispute about
words, but hold it to be of exceeding importance to Aus-
tralia that the Arab horse should not be discarded- by
reason of erroneous statements, perhaps you will allow me
to quote three other books taken absolutely at random,
and which prove the wonderful surefootedness of the
Arab horse in some parts of his environment, which are
amongst the most rocky and precipitous, travelled country.
in the world.
(1) Mr. Eliot Warburton, in “The Orescent and the
Cross,” writes that in one place he descended a steep
path that would have puzzled a European goat. At
another place the road wound sometimes along a deep
ravine, sometimes over a mountain’s brow, and was
nothing but a steep and rocky path, which in England a
goat alone could be expected to travel. Their horses,
however, went along- it at a canter, though the precipice
sometimes yawned beneath the outside stirrup.
(2) The Rev. J. L. Porter, in “The Giant Cities of
Bashan,” writes that he was mounted on a powerful
A-rab horse and rode along the northern bank of the
Kadisha, which was a mere goat track—now in a rocky,
torrent bed, now on the brink of a fearful ravine, now'
over a slippery track of naked limestone, now up rude
stairs that seemed as if letdown from Heaven itself.; a
bad and dangerous path. Not even when ascending
Hermon had the mettle and the steadiness of his Arab
Nizik been more severely tested. He confessed that his
own nerve was sometimes tried when he found one stirrup
ringing against the overhanging cliff while the other was
suspended over a fathomless abyss. At One time his
horse was about to reply to. a challenge from another,
when by a check of the bridle he silenced him, and the
wise creature seemed to know his danger.
(3) The same author in “ Five Years in Damascus, ’’ de-
scribes the road as ascending an almost perpendicular
cliff by a zigzag route w'hich, on first examination, caused
him almost to despair of his horse being able to stale it,
or to find footing; “but the Syrian horses are accus-
tomed to such paths, so that it seems but play for them
to spring up the rugged and irregular stairs. It is some-
what startling- to the inexperienced traveller when his :
steed assumes a vertical attitude, or passes along a preci-
pice brink, where a false step would hurl him hundreds
of feet below. But experience teaches one to place con-
fidence in his careful Arab, and to ride, without fear along
paths where an English fox-hunter would deem it mad-
ness to risk his neck.”

“ Viator ” : A number of Frenchmen are
agitating for the annexation of New Caledonia to
Australia. New Caledonia is 240 miles long,
average breadth 25 miles. It was discovered by
Cook in 1774, annexed by France in 1853. The
west coast has a barrier about five miles off the
coast. The east coast is precipitous. More than
half the island is mountainous. The highest peak,
Humboldt, is 5380 ft. up in the air. There are
500 square miles of valuable forest, not much
worked, abounding in kauri, etc. Pastoral land
covers 1600 square miles. Cultivable area is about
the same. There is coal over* about 450 square
miles, also plenty of iron, some gold, and many,
beautiful landscapes. The natural fertility
supplies wild the breadfruit, banana, ooooanut,
arrowroot, sago, etc. The isle produces grand
crops of coffee, sugar, maize, rice, tobacco, etc.,
and it is suitable for cotton. There are plenty of
horses, cattle and sheep. Meat preserving is
carried on. Nickel is the chief export. Birds,
such as pigeon, parrot, kingfisher and duck, are
in abundance. Lots of fish and turtles. The
natives, formerly cannibals, are of two races, one
dark Papuan, the other lighter Polynesian. The
island is well-watered with rivers-that are apt to
flood, and countless little streams run into the
sea. There are four little towns besides Noumea.

“ Iyles I.”: Some of the Darling River
sundowners have queer companions. One old
fellow carries around on his wanderings a cockatoo
in a cage. The latter is fastened to his swag.
The cockatoo is a good talker, but its vocabulary

its opinion of the curiosity who carts it around in
all weathers on all sorts of God-forsaken tracks.

A Sydney medical man just back from his
first tour through the far-out country gasps with
horror when poison is mentioned, “It’s marvel-
lous there’s a man alive out there,” he exclaims.
He tells of the careless ways in which bushmen
handle arsenic, strychnine and other deadly drugs.
“I’ve seen rabbit-skins, painted with arsenic, sus-
pended over a shearers’ dining-table. I’ve seen
the stuff dripping on to the table within half-a-foot
of a round of salt beef. On the table in the cook’s
galley I’ve counted three strychnine bottles, two
half-full, jumbled up with sauce and pickle bottles
in constant use. Men treat skins with poison,
handle them, pack them up, and, without wash-
ing their hands, grasp their food and help them-
selves with their fingers. ‘Don’t eat that,’ said
a cook to me. It was a bit of damper 1 picked
up ; I didn’t mean to eat it; I was merely smell-
ing it and wondering what it was composed of.
‘ A bit of poison slipped into the dough,’ remarked
the cook.”

“ Dandalup ” : “o.”does no more than
the correct and equitable thing when he hands to
the bushman (B. 17/9/’08) the wreath for dead-sure
timekeeping, suns watch, clock, or other mechani-
cal fan tod. In addition, the man who toils near
the Edge is a walking calendar. Most of him
keep two jam tins—one labelled, “This week,”
and the other, “Next week.” Seven small stones
complete the outfit. Every Saturday night all
the stones are emptied into “Last week.” On
Sunday morning one stone is taken out of
“Last week ” and dropped into “This week.”
This proceeding occurs every day until Saturday
arrives again, and Bill or Jim knows it’s the
blessed day upon which to make tracks for
Murphy’s (or someone else’s) pub. Some bush-
men even go so far as to keep a tin for the
“weeks.” Another plan is to make a large
damper on Sunday morning—large enough to last
one man.a week. The owner then, slices it into
seven pieces, and allots, a piece'to. each day of
the week. The only trouble, about this system
is. that a ravening mate happens along occasion-
ally, demolishes two or three days at a sitting,
and wrecks the calendar-

A company is about to be . formed in the Albury
(N.S.W.) district to extract radium from snakes.
Experts here have discovered that this remark-
able metal exists in all the reptiles found in
this part of the country, and are fully convinced
that if they can obtain the requisite capital, success
is assurer). At a preliminary meeting held at Murphy’s
Flat Hotel the matter was fully discussed, and it was.
decided to begin operations as soon as the necessary num-
ber of shares'have been subscribed. Mr. Murphy, who
acted as chairman and was the first to discover the pre-
sence of this remarkable virtue in snakes, explained in a
lucid and able manner the results of his scientific
research, and shbwed that failure was impossible, as
everything necessary for success was present in unlimited
quantities ; and as Murphy’s Flat would be the centre of
operations, the benefits the district would derive must'be.
apparent to every sensible man present.
The meeting was thoroughly in accord with the chair-
man’s; views, and subsequently a committee was formed
to promote the object of the, meeting.
The method of recovering the radium is very simple.
The snakes are first caught. They are then placed in a
large brick cellar about 20ft. deep, and fed on barley for
about four weeks. At. the end of that time they undergo
a process of distillation, in an appliance that has been
used in the mountains of Scotland for centuries. The
product is of a beautiful color, from a light straw to a
dark amber. It can betaken either alone or with water ;
and under its influence a man becomes a changed charac-
ter altogether. He walks on air, and has great ambitions.
Sample bottles sent to various parts have produced the
most remarkable results ; under their influence various
places have claimed to be the Federal Capital, and their
drains have been transformed into mighty and majestic
rivers.
Shares in the Murphy’s Flat Radium From Snakes Ex-
traction Co. may be had on application to Murphy. The
share list is filling fast. The reporter of the Howlong
Howler lately visited the field and made full inquiries,
and is satisfied that the industry has a great future. He
says it will pay better than journalism, and he applied
for half-a-share.
Bitter things are being said in Victoria
regarding one of the devices of the country land-
owner to loot the Treasury of a grant for the local
agricultural society. There is a fiction that agri-
cultural societies are educational, and to keep up
this hollow pretence they are required, as a con-
dition of the grant from the Treasury, either to
organise agricultural classes or to arrange for at
least four agricultural lectures a year. The lec-
tures are delivered free of cost by the Agricul-
tural Department’s experts, so all the farmers have
to do is to provide the hall and listen to the infor-
mation supplied to them, and get liberally paid
for listening. But it is complained that often the
lecturer is expected to give his gratis lecture in a
room at the pub, and that a perfunctory audience,
consisting of the hotel rouseabout and the town
loafer, makes hardly a decent pretence of listen-
ing. The Treasury says with anger that this is
very like getting a grant under false pretences ;
but the country landowner gets so many grants
under false pretences that one more hardly
matters*

MOTAVISH (infidel): “ Does Macpheerson auccupy

He's so vera regular .”
McDOUGAL (infidel): “ Eh , mon! He tak's up

“Schwartz”: Wherefore does the Aus-
tralian trout lack the supernatural cunning that
we have heard and read about so often as the pro-
perty of his English ancestor ? Is he too plentiful
or too healthily hungry, or is his brain dulled by
Federation—or have people been lying regarding
the astuteness of the overseas variety of him?
Outback last week I came across a strange pro-
cession. It consisted of Dad bearing on his
shoulder a sapling. (On the end of the felled
timber was a length of thick string with a nail
bent into the shape of a hook.) Bill followed with
bait. It was in a large jar. and consisted of a
seething conglomeration of worms, lizards and
other inhabitants of the sod. Jim strode beside
Bill and encouraged him. In the rear came Kate,
likewise Mum, with the “ tucker ” in an aged
sugar-bag. I struck them on the return journey
that evening, and lo ! the tucker bag was empty
of cooked viands and filled with sizeable fish.
That is why my opinion of the “troot’s” wiliness
has slumped and refuses to get up again.
THE GREY DRAY-DRIVER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The dray is red and the dray is blue, and the dray is white
all over,
And the grey dray-driver belts his steed, and he is a gay
bush-rover,
And he roves at full three miles an hour with a load of
bags behind him.
And as he rides on his bulging load his thirst doth still
remind him
The taste of the last, far beer he knew, and the scent of
the cool beer-grotto,
And he makes up his dusty mind to take “ More beer ! ”
for his mid-day motto;
And the dray goes bang and bump and swing as the while
road leads him, swearing,
To that far spot where he will plant the treasure his dray
is bearing.
The drayman grey is grey because o’ the white dust, grey
at landing
Upon his chiv. and clobber, and on each massive under-
standing ; ■
And this is the lot o’ the drayman grey—to rattle from
Here to There,
And make his big ’orse bear as big a load as his ’orse can
bear ;
And when his load is carted There, in cheerfulness
returning,
He carts stuff back from There to Here ; and look at the
wage he’s earning !
And then, at the close o’the long, warm day, he’ll part
from his chariot, cheerful
At thought o’ the long, warm night ahead, and the hour
when he’ll be beerful.

“ G.E.M.” : “The Prooshan” tells a little
truth —very little—about wombat-capture. In the
hilly districts of Tumbarumba (N.S.W.), where
water races and wombats are uncountable in
numbers, I used to tap the races for a smallstream
without interfering with the miner’s work and
causing him to track me with a sapling. Then I
would guide the water down the hillside by means
of a tiny trench, to the wombat’s hole. After
that I used to sit well back with an uplifted axe,
like Gabbett. If the pig was not too big I would
carry him home, give him a hot bath, and scrub
well until the skin was white and hairless; then
disembowel our humble relative and hang him up
to set. The result was fine pork without fat. My
brother and I had a leg baked in a camp oven in
company with a roast of beef one Sunday, and
were just about to dissect both, when a few neigh-
bors dropped in at our camp. Not liking to offer
them what they might be offended at, we left the
leg in the oven. But one of them, poking around,
lifted the lid, spotted the leg, and reviled us for
keeping back the leg of pig. Of course, we had
to produce it then, and everyone voted it good
pork—until one chap remembered we were in the
habit of eating wombat. Then they made need-
less remarks and superfluous observations. I have
been mining over 20 years, but have only heard of
one gold find being made per medium of piggy
(who looks more like a bear), and that was the
Dargo High Plains, Victoria.
PRESENCE OF MIND.
MISS MIGGS : “ William , did you catch those fish
on the Day of Rest? ”
WILLAM : “ Yes’m. See what they got for chasing
worms on a Sunday .”
“ Wang’s ” tale of sin :
Brindley is the local character when he lickersup ; he’s
a commonplace individual when he’s sober. He was
staggering along the street the other day in company
with a well-filled bottle. Around a corner appeared a
vision in a soup-plate hat and funereal garments.
Brindley instinctively tucked the bottle under his coat,
holding it lovingly to his chest with his strong right arm.
The vision bore down on him with hand outstretched.
“Go-ood da-ay, Mr. Brindley. Ho-ow are you to-o-
da-ay?” it said.
“ Goo’ da’,” echoed Brindley, unconsciously thrusting
out his hand to grab the parson’s fin.
There was a crash, and six-penn’orth of good Carlton
ale created fantastic designs on the toepath.
Brindley looked at it in anguish.
So did the parson ; but his anguish was of another
brand.
“ Well, I’m ! ” began Brindley.
“ ’Tis better the-are,” interrupted the pilot. “ ’Tis
better the-are. You should be glad to see it fall.”
“ Glad !” choked Brindley, “Glad! I’d sooner see a
dashed church fall.”
Then a great silence fell, and as it hadn’t got up again
when I finished counting ten, I reckoned the fight was
over.
A PLACE TO PASS.
THE SWAGGIE : “ Any work in the
town back there, mate?”
THE TRAMP : “ Too blessed much work! Why, arter
I’d whitewashed the bloomin' cells an' cleaned up the yard, the blessed cops gels in a load o’ wood.”
The pretty Victorian township of Yea,
which has 1100 people, is to be blotted out, it being
located on the area mapped out for the great local
water-storage scheme. On the completion of the
reservoir, Yea, 40ft. under water, will have
become Nay.
“Jim Carraway ” : The re-stocking of
Vic. and N.S.W, inland streams calls for prompt
attention from those enthusiasts who set greater
stock on the sporting and edible qualities of our
native fish than on the questionable merits of
acclimatised fry of imported species. The last
two spells of drought have pretty well wiped out
the native fish in streams remote from the
Murray and Murrumbidgee, the re-stocking
sources of their anabranches. Sludge and cyanid-
ing nuisances have done their deadly part, too, in
the mining country, and thence on through the
agricultural stretches. Steps have been taken to
cultivate cod and perch fishing grounds in the
Yarra, above the Falls, principally because city
professional influence is at hand. If certain areas
of the Big Trickle were now reserved from the
spoliation of local vandals, as is the case at
Corowa (N.S.W.), there would be a chance of
Australia’s premier stream and its big tributaries
being available for re-stocking the lesser branches ;
but the parent river’s resources have been over-
taxed of late years, apart from the incessant
poaching that is permitted on both sides of the
stream. Murray cod is a luxury in most country
towns at all times, a state of affairs rendered pos-
sible by the laggard methods of the State fishery
departments, and the department of Victoria in
particular.
“ J.A.K.” : Historical Cooktown, the
romantic port of the Far North, is to-day perhaps
the most defunct town on the Australian seaboard.
The battered dwellings, shabby business houses,
pubs, Government offices, surplus female popula-
tion, and superfluous Chinese, tell a sad tale
of vanished prosperity. The pearling fleets have
gone, likewise the roaring days of the Palmer,
and tidings of rich finds or black treachery ring
through the streets no more. The railway-—white
elephant of some forgotten Government—still
survives, a sorry spectacle in the general deca-
dence. The line runs to Laura (67 miles), where a
magnificent iron bridge carries the rails over the
Laura River. Here the navvies abruptly ceased
work, years back, when the bottom fell out of the
Palmer, and since then the bridge has lain idle,
and looks like a costly monument in the wilder-
ness. The train makes the return journey
twice a week—passengers or no passengers.
Wood is used instead of coal to fire the engine,
and the guard repeatedly alights en route and
furiously hoists stacks of timber into the tender.
I don’t know why this is—perhaps to save expense.
Grass grows luxuriantly on the station platform at
Cooktown, and a horrid, musty, dead odor escapes
when the window is thrown opeft to issue tickets
on train-days. The little traffic at the head of the
line is mostly confined to Chinese packers from
Maytown, who arrive regularly with small quanti-
ties of gold, and return with provisions, etc. Their
countrymen are engaged in the cultivation of pea-
nuts and maize along the river. The cultivation
of peanuts for oil-producing purposes is evidently
a remunerative pursuit, judging by the number of
Celestials who derive a livelihood thereby along
the fertile banks of the Laura. And yet Cook-
town is getting deader.
True copy of a Melbourne labor office's
letter: —
Israel’s Labor Supply Co., Head Office,
221 Lonsdale-streeet
(Opposite Melbourne Hospital),
21st August, ’OB.
Mr. . ,
Dear Sir, —Your letter to hand asking us to send you a
goad man for farm work and plough, wages Is. per day.
In reply we beg to state that we have been unable to get
a suitable man to go so far at sueh low wages, and evi-
dently you intend him to pay his own railway fare. We
think it would be desirable for you to try and fill up this
place locally.
We remain, yours faithfully,
“ Israel’s ” (J. Black, Manager).
One shilling a day, and pay his own fare to the
scene of the agricultural campaign ! And when
that sort of billet is left a yawning void the
country person starts in the Pastokalists’ Re-
view to state that the dearth of suitable country
labor is shocking, and that immigration ought to
be started on a very large scale before 4 o’clock
this same afternoon.
The faithful tripe-hound ! A doctor at
Tumby Bay, one of the rising Gulf ports of S.A.,
is fond of a morning dip, but has become some-
what discouraged. Twice lately a pet dog has
found his clothes on the beach and has trotted off
home with them, leaving his embarrassed and dis-
gusted master nothing but a pair of spectacles, a
towel and his bathing trunks to hide him from the
staring eyes of an astonished township.
SAILORS ON THE FARM.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
We were sittin’ in front o’ Ben Mosey’s store,
Along about sundown when work was done,
That’s me an’ Jack Thomson an’ sev’ral more,
When up rides Dicky—old Scrubbing son.
Sez he : “ Me father wants two good men
To pull ten acres or so o’ corn.”
“ What’s come o’ them as I sent?” asks Ben.
“ Them new-chums ! ” sez Dick, with a snort. “They’re
gorn.
“ Why, one he was Hiram, an’ one was Hank,
An’ they talked about Kansas an’ old Missoo.
Deserters th’ pair ; tho’ there warn’t no Yank
In the gol-durned fleet they e’en ’lowed they knoo.
“ Well, me father he sez, if they liked, he would
Put ’em on for a week, that’s if they could pull.
They guessed an’ cal’lated as how they could,
-An’ he give ’em th’ slide an’ th’ steer an’ bull.
“ When they started to drive, snakes alive ! ’twas sport,
With one on each side of th’ road to steer;
An’ Hiram cried 1 Starboard ! ’ an’ Hank yelled ‘ Port! ’
Accordin’ as how they desired to sheer.
“ Me father was shinglin’ a barn jes’ then
For Slocum, whose place is ten miles away.
He showed ’em th’ crop, an’ then left th’ men,
An’ he only got back agin yesterday.
“ An’ w'hat do yer think them fellers did ?
Why, strike me purple ! the barn was full
Of stalks pulled up by th’ roots —no kid !
They didn’t know farmin’ but they could pull.
“ An’ wasn’t th’ old man jes’ rampin’ wild !
Them Jackies, afore you’d ’a’ counted ten
Were cuttin’ out tracks ’sif their jints were iled ;
An’ there’s vacancies now for two workin’ men.”

THE BISHOP AND THE BAGMAN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
It was at the Sydney station. It was Platform Number
Four,
Where the porters always try to jam your fingers in the
door !
And the Western Mail was drawing out when through the
platform gate
Bushed the Bishop and the Bagman, both of them a
minute late !
“ D and B! ” exclaimed the Bagman. “ D and B 1” he
cried again !
But from faithfully recording all he said I must refrain ;
For the papers wouldn’t print it, and I very strongly
fear
It was not the sort of language we would like our wives
to hear !
Yet it seemed to soothe the Bishop, for he seized the Bag-
man’s hand
And he said in polished accents, with a smile extremely
bland :
“ Thank you very much indeed, dear sir ! Your language
I confess
My own feelings at this moment does most properly ex-
press !
“ Your remarks were quite in season and I should be no-
thing loth
To express myself as you did. but one can’t forget The
Cloth ! ”
“No, my Lord,” replied the other, “and no Bishop, I’ll
be bound,
Ever needs to do theswearing'whilea Bagman is around !”

ANSWERS to CORRESPONDENTS.
No notice (except of a hostile character) will be taken of
communications insufficiently stamped. Name and
address must appear on MSS. No liability is under-
taken re contributions voluntarily submitted, whether
sent by post or handed in; and no MS. will be
returned unless stamps (of any State) accompany.
Clarence (Maoriland): As you and your friends
have two “Independents” to choose from, ask each of
them if he will pledge himself to vote against all borrow-
ing except for the renewal of old loans, and for the estab-
lishment, along with each old loan that is renewed, of a
sinking fund of at least 1 per cent, to accumulate at
compound interest for the repayment of that loan. And
vote for the man who hollers most violently’ for a non-
borrowing policy. If neither will take up the non-
borrowing policy don’t vote at all. Also give up the
Freetrade superstition. It is a dreadfully foolish corpse
to have about the place Brown : According to British
law, the sending of old, cribbed matter (without intima-
tion that it is second-hand) to a paper which pays for
original matter only, is an attempt to get money by false
pretences. If you had been paid for it (which you won’t
be), you would have got money by false pretences. Then
you might have got three months. You sign “ the Reli-
gious Card Player,” as if it were your own work, which
it isn’t. Don’t try the game again. It is risky
L. : For a start, write to the city dailies and tell them
what you can do ...A.V.V.: “Boy” has some simple
strength ; but the work is very crude in spots... Myrtle :
One par may get in ; the style’s all right. “ Retrospect"
very nearly arrives. Don’t remember others mentioned.
. ...W.A.H.: Your “In Memoriam ” notice of the 1890
Oup is awful... .Battle Maid : Nothing but its originality
of plot and style to recommend your yarn—black gin who
married one for whom she (the gin) “ had not a spark of
love or respect,” and who, after the ceremony, was “ no
longer the considering lover, but the hard, overbearing
husband” with “no respect for the gin’s finer feelings.”
Annie W.: You voice the sentiments of the B. Smith
school of Defence thinkers. Herewith a verse, however,
to show we bear no malice
The old watch dog is waiting,
When he hears our battle cry
He’ll mow them down in thousands,
For the Yellow man must die.
Waitahuna : Thanks. The thief you have exposed is
already dead—artistically, anyhow....J.R.E. : Simply a
bald statement that Jack died after a hard life of it,
while a nor’-easter was blowing The Boss: Document
purporting to show by figures that Thomas Bent is the
Beast of Revelation to hand ...Seecasey: Nothing in it
except the rhyme. It is always advisable to have at
least a semblance of reason... .M.J. (M.L.): Neither of
them good enough Bushman’s Camp: Two gentle
pastoral melodies of little worth... .G.A. : Verses neatly
done, but rather mechanical Viola: “Coquette” is a
rather monotonous string of rhymes. “Witchery” has
music in it, but we can’t allow Sibyl to “ weld her lilting
voice with her smile.” Welding is a blacksmith’s j0b....
Newsboy: “The Chilly Poet” froze to death in the
basket W.W.B. : Opening line of poem entitled “If I
Could” —“Could I only write a poem that would strike
The Bulletin or any other paper as a likely sort
of thing.” Your poet’s license is hereby cancelled
M.S. (Queensland): Story not particularly inter-
esting Thorold (S.A.): Considering two of them
Lee-Enfield: Nicely done, but so many others have
voiced the same dare-devil sentiments Red Hanky : A
fatal defect about “ The Tramp and the Cook ” is that it
is 16J timestoolongforitsinterest J.H.R.: Wehaven’t
the figures analysing the recent egg-laying competitions.
“ C.K.Y.,” who was responsible for the par stating that
there was no money in poultry-raising, is hereby requested
to forward to us his authorities in the matter. When he
does so you shall have them.... S.T.: “ A Dream ”is too
slight..'. .Luten : “The Exhibitions” will cause some
heart-burnings in local Art circles, but in a slab of it
goes:
The misty scapes—the filthy nudes—
The “ Portraits “ Pastorals
Appeared fit food, I fear,
But for the kitchen flame.
I hear some painters hiss, let them be calm,
For there were some, on which
Had dawned the light of mighty Genius—
There were some —which clearly showed
The authors of their being
Yet might mount the stair,
The stair that leads the way
Within the hall of Fame.
. ..Nostaw : Truly you have got the coupon madness about
as badly as anybody this paper knows. Still there is no
disease that hasn’t an advocate somewhere Mac : You
have the front to send two of the oldest of Yankee
spread-eagleisms, and swear that they were delivered quite
recently by Maoriland candidates. Do you happen to
know that you are a liar—also a considerable fool ?
M. :Itis a joke—an Irish one. Its age protects it
from the indignity of re-hashment A.E.H.: Candor
forces us to own that there is no merit in them H.D.:
The religious editor shied right across his office on being
handed your caricature suggestion re Lady May, Sir
George, and the Redeemer.... Wanderer : Facts that a
Chinese city smells reprehensibly, has a plethora of but-
chers’ shops with entrails of dead beasts on sale, and so
on, are a shade trite for publication these days.... The
Brat: Our sincere opinion of “ A Leap-year Dance ”is
that it is not a dance at all, but a mere stagger, and it
doesn’t leap worth twopence;.. .N.B.W. : If “ the nurse
at Little Bay ” is as good as that, she deserves some better
reward than your poem. Why not send her a picture
postcard?.. . .Rock : The last verse killed it Wang :
When you write half a story (like your Cup yarn) in the
past tense, and then write the other half in the present
tense it makes so much trouble in correcting that it is
often cheaper to throw the yarn away 0.5.: Verse
about poppies and wheat is pretty, but hardly vigorous
enough.... F.C.G. : It was a Federal tax ; and Carruthers
claimed that, as the State Government was the Crown,
the netting wasn’t taxable. The High Court decided that
there couldn’t be two Crowns, one saying Yes and the
other No, and that so far as this matter was concerned
the State Government wasn’t the Crown. So the State
Government (through its agent) was fined... .C.S.J.D.:
There is a big difference between unemployment in the
United States and in most other countries. The United
States, during the last year for which figures are available
(1906), received 1,100,735 immigrants—say, 91,700 per
month. That means 91,700 new unemployed every month,
almost all at New York, for every arrival is unemployed
till he gets a job. To drop about 1,100,000 new unem-
ployed annually into a single country—almost all into a
single city of 4,100,000 people—of course makes “ lack of
work ” there, for a huge proportion of them try theirluck
in New York before moving on, and often oust the local
worker. Britain in 1907 (latest statistics) sent away
634,700 people. It exports unemployed ; the U.S. import
them... .James F. : No use for exceedingly mild and
dreary moral reflections about ingratitude to sailors.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC) CONTRIBUTORS.
W.N.T.: Your drawings are of the school-boy breed,
and the quips appended have been printed before
J.8.N.: The joke is old ; it is stolen ; it is American ; it
was never any good ; and the picture is awful Arthur
Valli : For Heaven’s sake write the legends below your
pictures in INK, not in dim pencil... .P.J.X.: Too
sketchy altogether... W.J.C.: That Salvation joke is
very, very old.

Lieutenant Manfred Rose, who died at
Neutral Bay, Sydney, a few days back, had an
experience many years back as Charles Dickens’
amanuensis. Born in Tasmania, he went early to
America, and served through the Civil War (that
was how he became lieutenant); after that he
drifted to England, and got the job of writing to
Dickens’ dictation when Dickens was tired of
scratching for himself. Among the Dickens odds
and ends he preserved were the notes for four
preliminary chapters of ‘ ‘ The Tale of Two Cities ”;
but Dickens finally decided to drop into his yarn re-
garding Jeremiah Cruncher, the gentleman who
objected to “flopping,” without the prologue. In
later years Rose did something as a conjurer and
illusionist, and afterwards took
up theatrical management with less
success than his good heart de-
served.

• One of the N.S.W. papers
described Willy Kelly, the other day, as “the
•T. C. L. Fitzpatrick of the Federal House.” It was
a true description. Willy Kelly and Fitzpatrick
are the only two Parliamentarians that habitually
omit to ‘play the game.” The Reps, were dis-
cussing the vote for a Customs yacht (4/11/08)
when Kelly assailed Lyne thuswise :
It is a perfect boat for you to entertain your friends on
Why, you said to me, “All right, Kellv ; if you want the
boat at any time, just apply for her.”
Kelly, like Fitzpatrick—whose hobby it is to
“draw” members whom he suspects of being
under the weather —has no conception of the Par”
liamentary decencies, more especially in the
matter of private communications. The above
bears a family resemblance to Kelly’s famous
Hoad blunder. Hoad—a political opponent of
Kelly’s—was unwary enough to drop the latter a
friendly line of farewell before going abroad.
Kelly gleefully read out in the House Hoad’s
private communication to him, in support of a-
charge he was levelling against Hoad of “’ eburting
Parliamentary influence ! ”
W. H. Donald,
who was trained
for the Inky Way
in Sydney and
Melbourne, has
been awarded a
Monkey decoration
—the Order of the
Rising Sun, 6th
class, which seems
something a shade
better than the
Order of the Sack,
Ist class, though it
isn’t any more
edible. Early i n

unpleasantness
Donald represented
some Sydney, Mel-
bourne and Ade-
laide papers, and
subsequently was
special correspond-
ent for the London
Daily Express
with the Baltic
Fleet during its
stay on the coast
of Annam (Asia).
He was the only
British journalist
to witness the de-
parture of the Fleet
from the Chinese
shore for its battle
with Togo at Tsu-
shima. After leav-
ing Australia Don-
ald got a job on the
China Mai l, a
paper printed at
Hongkong, and be-
came in turn editor,
manager and chair-
man of directors ;
but he recently re-
signed to become
special correspondent for the New York Herald.
Bill lies, who, after his acquittal on the
charge of murdering Madge Graham, at Ballarat
(Vic.), was interred in deep forgetfulness, has
once more reached the public eye. He has been
in trouble at Kilmore on a mere trivial, unro-
mantic charge of assault. Even the person whom
he is alleged to have assaulted has the hopelessly
unromantic name of Tucker—and it couldn’t be
much less romantic than that if it were plain
Dough.
Mr. Arthur Henry closed his official
career in the N.S.W. Bankruptcy Court on
October 31. He lias put through his'hands in the
course of his Registrar-ship many thousands of
impecunious and deficient citizens, and has done
it affably even when the dividend was only 7Jd. in
the quid. He was one-time secretary to Governor
Belmore, and there is a legend that he possessed
much important inside information about the
attempted assassination of the Duke of Edin-
burgh, but whether it related to the inside of the
event or the inside of the duke isn’t very clear.
Anyhow, the Edinburgh shooting episode is a
very old and dead affair nowadays.
As might have been expected, the charges
against Miss Sutherland, the rescuer of many a
Melbourne waif, have been found “not
sustained.” Miss Sutherland has no
time to be affable, and she has even got
out of the habit of being polite ; so when
a catmittee heard some spiteful remarks,
it said, “Oh, do go on, please!” and
it had no difficulty in getting itself told
the things it wanted to hear. So the
friend of the homeless was impeached
as . “ a drunken woman who thrashed
children in arms and slashed round
indiscriminately with a cane.” The
charges collapsed when the alleged vic-
tims themselves denied the cruelty; but
the best answer was supplied by Miss
Sutherland herself when she said, “In
seven years I put up a building, paid
every penny for it, and left the com-
mittee with a credit balance. Does that
look like the work of a drunken woman? ”
tf it does look like it. Miss Sutherland
might certainly tell the catmittees what brand
she uses. A little of the same would do them
no end of good.
A. H. Griffith, who was shut out of the
N.S.W. Assembly the other night, after a dis-.
agreement with the Speaker, and then resigned his
seat, got into that situation by an accident. Cann,
the member for Broken Hill, who would have tried
to move the adjournment in the ordinary
course, had just undergone a second seri-
ous operation; wherefore Griffith, his neigh-
bor, had to take up the job. Cann was
Chairman of Committees and Deputy Speaker
for some years of fierce party fighting ; and, after
many years spent in the hard physical toil
of mining, a job which glued him to a chair
for hours at a stretch left him a good deal of a
physical wreck. His present trouble is simply a
succession of unromantic carbuncles.
“ Boswell ” measures up N.S.W. Premier
Wade :
For many years an almost ferocious Crown Prosecutor
there has been no change in the quality of his heart since
his accidental entry into politics; and as time rolls on he
becomes more merciless from day today. Starting- off
six weeks after his appointment'as Attorney-General and
Minister for Justice, we discover a proclamation of
sweeping reductions in the miserable prison diet, com-
bined with petty deprivations of tobacco and other com-
forts for “offences” against discipline. In the prisons
they know him therefore as “ Pinchgut.” At his first
Cabinet meeting after assuming the ,Premiership an
innocent man (Reuben Ward) was ordered 'duel punish-
ment. His liquor laws and betting Act are narrow, des-
perate attempts to gaol a large proportion of the people,
inoffensive in all other ways. He there blossoms into
a manufacturer of criminals. His Habitual Criminals Act
is Draconic. His Habitual Drunkards Act is little better.
He repealed the most humane Arbitration Act, and sub-
stituted the already-notorious Industrial Disputes Act,
excluding preference to unionists. His treatment of the
tramway strikers again revealed the heart of stone. His
Police Offences Bill is in keeping with the man. Even his
Contagious Diseases Bill, if the Assembly isn’t careful,
will give gaol officials a chance to combine against any
unfortunate who incurs their resentment, and detain
him for any length of time. His expensive attempt to
chouse MCHarg out of his pension shows him still in the
same light, a champion of the strong against the weak.
His attitude towards the Australian Government, his
feeble attempts at magnanimity and generosity, all
stamp him indelibly with the words of the Caliph Omar :
“A big man in little things, and a little man in big things.”
THE DISHONORED PROPHET.
“I wish I were as certain of having £1000 on the winner
of the Cup as I am of knowing what the weather will be
like to-morrow. A bad da y—in fact, a beastly day,” said
Mr. Griffiths, Assistant Commonwealth Meteorologist.
MRS. NOLAN: “ Yes, Sarah, ’s true ez I’m here,
the butcher he sez to me, ‘Back Lord Nolan,’
he sez, ’n’ I’d ’a' won a pot o’ money over
him, on’y when the bloke what does the
weather fer the Gov’ment said it was going t’
be a beastly wet day, o’ course I wasn’t on
fer goin’ out there an’ gettin’ me dress spoiled.”
Ewen Hugh Cameron, one of the parts of
the old Cabinet which Bent had no use for when
he patched up the ancient ark again the other
day, has had a remarkable career. For 35 years
the ex-butcher and present farmer has represented
Evelyn, a fruit and dairying district to the north-
east of Melbourne. Eight of those years were
spent as whip to the O’Loghlin, Service-Berry,
Gillies-Deakin and Patterson Governments ; eight
more as chairman of the Railways Standing Com-
mittee ; and the last six as Minister of Mines and
Water Supply to the Iceberg and as Public Works
to Bent. In all that third of a century there
stands to his credit hardly a speech worthy of
note, hardly one act that was remembered a week
after he had left office. He wasn’t actively harm-
ful; in fact, what he was mostly given a job for
was because he was reckoned to be quite harmless.
The death of a very ancient Baptist, the
Rev. Hibberd, the first of C. H. Spur
geon’s “pastors” to settle in Sydney
parts, recalls why the hardshell sect,
though stern about most things,
has never joined with any enthu-
siasm in Bije Dowie’s crusade
against the stinkpot; also it
explains why other stern
evangelical sects of N. S.
Wales have never had any-
thing much to say against
the sinful pipe. The Rev.
Hibberd was brother-in-law
of Hugh Dixson, and one
way and another, through
him, quite a crowd of
Baptist and evangelical
lights have become mixed
up with the tobacco busi-
ness. Further, just as in S.
Australia Chief Justice Way
hung on to the little Bible
Christian sect, so Hugh Dixson
clove to the Baptists, and has
been their chief financial prop and
_ ______ i ii
stay ; ana it takes a very bold sect to
quarrel with its chief financial prop and stay even
over a pipe of tobacco.
Four of the eight members of Queens-
land’s Phidston Ministry—Bell, O’Sullivan, Haw-
thorn and Appel—belong to the Costs-pursuing
brigade. Bell and O’Sullivan are barristers, and
Hawthorn and Appel are solicitors. Bell and
Appel, however, are sufficiently wealthy to be
able to live without chasing Costs to its lair. The
four lawyers are all Australians, while the other
half of the Cabinet—Kidston, Barlow, Denham
and Paget—are British-born. Bell, O’Sullivan and
Appel are Queenslanders, Hawthorn is a Tas-
manian, Barlow, Denham and Paget are English,
and Kidston is a Scotchman frae Falkirk.
Died, on Nov. 3, at Newnes (N.S.W.),
Austin Joseph O’Grady, who made one burst for
fame, and didn’t get hold of more than the frayed
hem of it. He followed the making of the railway
line from Nyngan to Bourke, and then stood as a
Parliamentary candidate for the district. There
were seven candidates—it was in 1891 and
O’Grady stood at the bottom of the poll, with 102
votes. The other six were men of some note —
H. Langwell, W. N. Willis, J. P. Howe (success-
ful three), T. Waddell, E. D. Millen, and W. W.
Davis. Howe resigned in the building societies’
troubled times, and T. Waddell took his place.
Although the Peak Downs (Queensland)
goldfield was discovered somewhere about 45
years ago, a claim for the £2OOO reward for finding
it was presented to the Queensland Government
only the other day. The applicant is David
Downes, and he is backing the claim with affi-
davits of persons who went to Peak Downs in the
early days, and found him already boiling his billy
there. But as there is another alleged discoverer
of the field, Downes may have some trouble in
capturing the £2OOO.
“ R. W.R.” writes from Maoriland
This blessed little Dominion has been exciting itself
over the hoary Meikle case again. About 20 years ago
J. J. Meikle was haled before the courts of the country on a
charge of sheep-stealing, and, after an exciting trial, was
sentenced to sundry years’ free board and lodging. He
served his time, but when he came out he made things
hum. He gathered together evidence which professed to
show that one Lambert, on whose testimony J.J. had been
sentenced, was little better than a perjurer. This was
the view a Supreme Court took of the matter, and Lambert
was sent off to do certain years’free board and lodging.
Meanwhile Meikle descended on Parliament with a de-
mand for the removal of his name from the prison records
of the colony (it was a colony then), and adequate com-
pensation for wrongful imprisonment. Meikle had the
howls of an indignant country behind him, and official-
dom agreed that he should have compensation. But it
didn’t know so much about the records. The name of
John James Meikle appeared in all manner of books and
records as a purloiner of sheep, and officialdom said that
it couldn’t blot and disfigure all these volumes. Official-
dom reckoned without Seddon. Seddon recognised the
Voice of the People, and he affixed a tag to every book
and paper whereon Meikle’s patronymic occurred, de-
claring that Meikle did not steal sheep. Meikle was not
satisfied, but he had, perforce, to accept the compro-
mise. At the same time he accepted several hundred
pounds of State money, giving in return a receipt in full
satisfaction of all claims. Then the People cheered King
Dick.
A year or two later, Meikle bobbed up serenely once
more. He ignored his previous transactions with the
State, and wanted more compensation. The Government
ignored him. It was getting tired of Meikle and his
ways. But Meikle hammered away for a few years, and
finally Seddon, in desperation, authorised a Koyal Com-
mission to inquire into his case. Shortly afterwards
Seddon passed out, and the Commission was left in the
hands of officialdom. Officialdom, of course, deliberated
wearily over the matter for a year or so, and then it
appointed two Supreme Court Judges to be a Commis-
sion, and instructed them to make the fullest possible
inquiry. They did. Their report, when printed, had the
appearance of a Webster’s Dictionary. Its perusal afforded
entertainment to the People, and the latter began to have
doubts about Meikle. The report talked about his
alleged lack of many of the finer characteristics of a
citizen ; and it was rumored that he was really a sort of
speculation run by a syndicate. The People decided that
they had absolutely no time for Meikle, and began to
yell “ Mad Dog,” and the reign of Meikle oh his pinnacle
of martyrdom was over.
But the Commission had declared that, on the evidence
submitted at the trial, Meikle should not have been con-
victed, and there was introduced during last session of
Parliament the “ Meikle Acquittal Bill,” which proposed
to pay Meikle £5OOO, and dispose of him for ever. This
little measure was unostentatiously slipped into a weary
House one night, and members, tired of Meikle and all
his works, nearly allowed it to pass. But at its last read-
ing one A. L. D. Fraser awoke, and made such virulent
comments regarding that £5OOO that the People began to
be interested. The scene of Meikle’s alleged misde-
meanors was a little place called Wyndham, and the
Wyndhamites (who had first backed Meikle in his cam-
paign) asked Fraser to come to Wyndham so that they
might banquet him. Fraser agreed, and was duly ban-
queted, and at the function Meikle’s late neighbors rose
and said unpleasant things about Meikle. The proceed-
ings were full of enthusiasm for the confusion of Meikle,
and Meikle, who was conducting a counter demonstration
in a hall a few hundred yards away, was rushed by hood-
lums who called out “boo.” Just at this time news
came that Lambert, who had finished his sentence
for perjury said to have been committed against
Meikle, was about to start a crusade of his own on
the assertion that he had also been wrongly convicted ;
and it appeared that he would also want damages from
the Government. The vision of another person like
Meikle agitating up and down the face of the country
struck the community as too awful. The Dominion (it
was now a Dominion) tied a wet towel round its aching
brows and sat down to write about that £5OOO. The
other day, the Supplementary Estimates were brought
before Parliament, whereon appeared the Meikle grant
of £5OOO. It was the closing hours of the session, but
a soporific House sat up straight in its seat and asked
Joe Ward questions. Joe replied feebly, and next day
the Maoriland taxpayer learned that the House, by a
large majority, had reduced the Meikle grant by £4999.
Meikle has not been heard of since, but he is probably
awaiting.the result of the now imminent election. Mean-
while, what about Lambert ?

G. Appel is Minister for Works and
Mines in Queensland’s new Coalariot (hurried
combination of “Coalition” and “Iscariot”)
Ministry. He has only been about nine months
in Parliament, but there is reason for his appoint-
ment. First, he is said to be threatened with
brains, and that is fairly rare among the Philpites.
Second, he is more or less German, and his
appointment is expected to please the folk of the
South Queensland coastal districts, where almost
everybody is named either Hoch or Sauerkraut.
Appel’s father was the first foreign consul ap-
pointed in Brisbane, and one of his grandfathers
was a Moravian missionary who came to this
country in 1837.
THE ALTERNATIVE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
I would sooner be found dead than join the Bent
Ministry.—Prendergast, M.L.A. {Victoria).
If, some day, you should find me, cold and stark—
If you should stumble o’er my lifeless clay
In some still thoroughfare or public park
And sadly say:
“ Alack, and had he lived, as like as not
He’d reigned with Bent ! ” I should not care a jot.
If I should die in some by-way obscure,
And you should come across my silent corse
In its last sleep, my spirit would-be sure—
Know no remorse.
’Twere better that I thus had ceased to live
If life with Bent were the alternative.
I say, if I should die, and all alone ;
And, dying thus, escape the wiles of Bent;
O’er my remains I’d have you make no moan.
Nor yet lament.
But let relief be mingled with your woe ;
And murmur o’er my clay, “ ’Twere better so.”
Nay, if you came, as in my bier I lay,
And said, “ Who knows ? If this had not occurred ”
I should arise in my grave-clothes and say,
“ Don’t be absurd !”
And, being safely out of Tommy’s reach,
I’d probably get out and make a speech.
I’d tell you, “ Better have a monument
Above my head and, coffined, lie at rest
Than live in some weird Cabinet with Bent
Upon my chest.”
And, having said all that was to be said,
I should continue being very dead.

PARALYSED WITH RHEUMATISM.
N.S.W. Man a Helpless Cripple. — Lifted In
and Out of Bed.—Cured Through the
Blood.
Rheumatism is deep down in the blood. It
will yield to nothing that does not touch the blood.
That’s why it’s foolish to try and cure it with em-
brocations and outward applications. These
things never go more than skin deep. Dr.
Williams’ Pink Pills have cured rheumatism be-
cause they drive out of the blood the very cause
of it—poisonous acid. They did this for Mr.
Stephen Ransom, a well-known boundary rider of
Henry Street, Quirindi, N.S.W., when he was
crippled with the pain; so why shouldn’t they do
the same for other suffering rheumatics? Mr.
Ransom says:—
“I was crippled with rheumatism, and in such
a condition that I could not even move, let alone
go out to work,” said Mr. Ransom. “My posi-
tion exposed me to all kinds of weather, and on
one occasion I was out for days in the cold and
wet. Through this I got the rheumatism. I
found each morning when I got up the pains were
all over me—they got so bad that at times I yelled.
At last I could not get out of bed. When I laid
down I could not rise, I had to be propped up in
bed with several blankets round my shoulders. I
could not sleep with the pain. The only time I
was out of bed was when my children lifted me
out on to a chair. For weeks and weeks I suffer-
ed like this, paralysed with rheumatism. No
man ever suffered more pain than I did. Then by
a piece of good luck I read about Dr. Williams’
Pink Pills. After the second box I obtained won-
derful relief, the pain was very much less. After
this wonderful change I kept on with Dr.
Williams’ Pink Pills till I had taken six boxes,
when I found that I could walk with ease, and 1
was able to start my work again. How pleased
was lat this! By the time I had taken nine
boxes of these pills I started to do my work as 1
had never done it before. They put wonderful
life into my body, and from that day to this 1
have been perfectly cured. Everybody knows
of my wonderful cure through Dr. Williams’ Pink
Pills, and at my extreme old age, 73, it is wonder-
ful. Here lam walking the streets of Quirindi in
perfect health. It will give me pleasure to speak
of these pills at all times and of how they cured
me—l have never had a pain since I took them.”
Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills are good for any com-
plaint that a supply of rich red blood is good for,
but one neess to be careful to get the genuine, as
substitutes sometimes offered are useless. They
are sold by most chemists and storekeepers, price
2s. 9d. per box, six boxes 15s. 3d.; or if they can-
not be obtained locally will be sent free on receipt
of price by the Dr. Williams’ Medicine Co. of

POLITICAL
POINTS
Daily paper :
Mr. Reid said that while he was exceedingly anxious to
preserve a White Australia, he thought they should not
differentiate between white and colored labor interferin' l '
with an industrial dispute.
Good old Yes-No !
The tactless Wade played right into the
hands of Labor-Oppositionist Arthur Griffith in
the Assembly the other night, and Griffith jumped
at the lucky chance. Griffith wanted to move the
adjournment to discuss the sending of police to
Broken Hill, and was blocked, whereupon he said
a few mostly justifiable things, and was hauled up
by the Speaker, and finally, when he wouldn’t
apologise, was shut out of the House on Wade’s
motion. Promptly Griffith shot in his resigna-
tion. The fact was Griffith had scarcely a hope of
re-election for his Sturt (Broken Hill South) seat,
as a new brand of Socialist would have got the
Labor nomination ; but Wade martyred Griffith,
and Sturt will re-elect him, and his chances of
being returned at the general election also go up
100 per cent.
Adolphus Bent’s new Tory Cabinet begins
to back-pedal already. Before he resigned, ex-
Ghief Secretary Peacock had given notice of reso-
lutions for the establishment of Wages Boards in
the furniture, rubber goods, grocery and drapery
trades; but at their first meeting the new ineap-
ables considered that the latter two Boards—for
the sweated shop-hands—would be too drastic an
innovation, and that “ the time had not yet
arrived,” so they hung the matter up by referring
it back to Chief Secretary Mackey to think over
it, or lose it in a pigeon-hole, or do any other
old thing with it.
Some curious things happen in Westralia.
At last election Buzzacott, the Labor candidate,
won the Menzies election by seven votes against
Minister Gregory, to the great anger of the aggre-
gate Conservatism of the State. There was an
appeal, and the Chief Justice decided that nine
persons had voted without proper qualification.
It wasn’t Buzzacott’s fault that the Tory Govern-
ment’s electoral officer allowed them to vote when
they hadn’t proper qualification, and the report
doesn’t even say whether they voted for Buzzacott
or not. All the same the Labor member was un-
seated and ordered to ‘pay Costs. It looks a
thoroughly Westralian way of doing things.
The capital site ballot in the Senate was a
struggle between Toryism and Democracy. The
Yassberra party stood for the supremacy of the
State over the Commonwealth; for a small
Federal territory, so that the land values created
by the expenditure of Federal money may to a
great extent be mopped up by the private landlord
over the bordbr in jN.S.W. ; for restriction in
every form, lest the democratic Australian Parlia-
ment may have room to try “Socialistic experi-
ments,” and lest the capital may grow to .be a big
city and, under the immediate shadow of the
most democratic Parliament in the world, a great
centre of progressive ideas. So the Tories
(Cameron, Clemons, Dobson and M‘Farlane, of
lasmania ; Sayers and Sledger and T. Drinkwater
Cbataway, of Queensland ; McColl and Simian
Phraser, of Victoria ; Gould, Grey, Millen, Neild,
Pulsford and Walker, of N.S.W. ; Vardon and
Josiah Symon, of S.A.) were for Yassberra to a
man—or any other animal.
The Congested Population party carried
the selection of Yassberra in the Senate by 19
votes to 17. At first there was a tie, but then
Senator McColl, of Victoria, ratted to the party
which wants to crowd the population of the Aus-
tralian capital as close as possible to the County
of Cumberland, s which already has the densest
population in all Australia. It was a curious
circumstance that it should be a Victorian who
supplied the majority for Yassberra, after all the
weepings of the Sydney morning papers about the
Victorian conspiracy against that place. Yass got
out a premature brass band when it heard that
Yassberra had come on top in the Senate ballot.
The point which Yass possibly didn’t notice is
that by law the capital of Australia is still on
Monaro, and until that law is repealed and a new
one passed the ballot is merely a frill.
WADE’S SCARECROW.
The probable effect of sending a large force of police to
Broken Hill will be to fan the existing flame of discon-
tent into a huge conflagration. — News Item.
The “ Old Soldier ” writes :
The old Sydney Telegraph is very angry indeed
because people are beginning to understand that Univer-
sal Training, as the Commonwealth proposes to makeit, is
not such a very terrible thing after all. It says
“ The object of it is to force all males of a certain age
to leave their ordinary avocations in peace time and go
into the army. What more does conscription do than
that ? ”
It doesn’t do nearly so much. There is no such thing
as conscription anywhere now, and there never was
except in France, where, till the fall of the Second
Empire, all the young men of each commune, who had
completed their twentieth year during the last 12 months,
were called to draw numbers from an urn. Those
who drew the lowest numbers had to serve in
the army nominally for ten years unless they
could pay a sum which varied from £4O to £BO
to the Government to provide a substitute. That
system has been abolished for the last 38 years. No
substitutes are to be had now at any price, and the term
of service is two years for a young Frenchman. For him
that is not only, as the Telegraph puts it, a difference of
degree, but of kind. In the time of conscription, a
French soldier might be sent off to pass most of his long
term of service on a foreign station. Now he can never
be sent out of France without his own consent, exceptfin
the contingency of having to pursue an invading army
beaten in an attempt to cross the frontier. The Tele-
graph should really get some knowledge of its subject
before it shouts again.
In 10 years S. Australia has bought back
19 estates of over 5000 acres each, and cut the 19
up into farms for 885 families —and apparently
there are a few blocks still available. The cost
has been nearly £1,000,000, which seems a
tremendous lot of money to pay for land for
settling 885 families—something like £ll3O each.
No wonder, in spite of good seasons, the landless
S. Australian moves across into Queensland ; and
no wonder the Price Government reckons that a
progressive land-tax has become urgent.
IS HE PULLING A LEG?
J. BULL (to the Kaiser, after his effusive declara-
tion of friendship): “Perhaps you mean well,
Willie, hut that’s not how we shake hands
here.”
The Victorian Assembly has just passed
the Woman’s Suffrage Bill for the eighteenth
time, and it isn’t law yet, nor is it likely to be.
Yet the Victorians are supposed to be a self-
governing community.
These days the desire of every Victorian
politician of any standing to get away from Bent
could hardly be more remarkable if that person
were a disease instead of a human being with
billets to dispense. Minister Boyd was on his way
back from a holiday when the old Bent Cabinet
was broken up and the new one constructed.
Boyd was included in the new Cabinet, but he
just cast one wild glance at the company he had
got into, considered Hunt and Downward and
poor old Bow-wow of Wangaratta, and then passed
in his resignation the same as Peacock and Co.
Bent could paper a room with resignations now.
He has got everybody’s resignation except his
own, and he may get that when Parliament meets.
The “Old Soldier” writes:—
Some inquisitive lunatic has undertaken to ask Minister
Ewing in the Eeps. about the deferred pay of the Per-
manent Artillery, and was told that so many left with
less than three months’ service as to cause a loss of hun-
dreds of pounds to the Commonwealth. For some in-
scrutable reason the framers of the regulations have pro-
vided that a soldier of the Permanent Force may, at any
time within three months after enrolment, subject to the
approval of the District Commandant and his command-
ing officer, “ obtain his discharge free.” That may be a
simple way of getfing rid of the bad bargains, those who
are never likely to make good soldiers, but, in the mean-
time, they have been supplied with uniforms and neces-
saries, the cost of which is a dead loss to the Government.
It may be quite right to get rid of the unwilling soldier
who finds he has mistaken his vocation, or has changed
his mind, and might change it again when the strange-
ness'had worn off. But people who are liable to such light-
ning* changes should be made to pay for the luxury of not
being able to make up their minds. The voluntary
system, as people are fond of calling it, has not justified
half the fine things that are said about it. In Australia,
at any rate, it has broken down lamentably. The utmost
that can be said for it is that it has provided some fairly
good drill-masters, but hardly a reliable fighting force for
an emergency.
One of Bent’s earliest acts when he had
got his new Cabinet loosely gummed together was
to place before it the desirability of building two
railways across that stretch of the Western District
which he awhile back babbled of compulsorily re-
suming and cutting up. The lines are intended
to open up the empty counties of Hampden,
Grenville and Ripon, the fastnesses of the big
landgrabbers; they are badly needed, and will
serve 700,000 acres—and Bent’s proposal is to
accept the landlords’ offer of £150,000 towards the
cost of the lines, and spread the payments over a
long term of years. That is to say, he proposes
to make the landlords a present of from £2 to £3
per acre and to accept 4s. 6d. per acre in return,
and then to extend the payments so that they can
sell the lands and pass the 4s. 6d. on to the buyers.
It is a great scheme —for the landowners. And it
is so like Bent.
H. A. Parsons, whose life is made nice and
comfortable through an accident which happened
when he was born —the stork dropped him into
the millionaire land-grabbing family—has
been lecturing at Angaston. S. Australia, he
remarked, was an awful tadpole—it “exhibited
the greatest proportion of inhabitants in its
capital city, as compared with the population of
the State, of any country in the world—viz., 4576
out of every 10,000.” Then, having drawn atten-
tion to the fact that Queensland was advertising
largely, and getting settlers even from S. Aus-
tralia, Angas Parsons stopped short. He didn’t
go on to point out that the proportion of decent
agricultural land in S. Aus. was very small, and
that a great deal of what there was of it had been
collared very early in the proceedings by the
Angases and a few others. He didn’t point out
that, on account of sheep running on big estates
which ought to be running men, farmers had
lately been driven out on to the Pinnaroo and
other sand patches. He referred sourly to the
fact that Queensland was “enticing S. Aus-
tralians away,” and then just stopped short.
The Postal authorities are again making
overtures to the Melbourne Tram Co. regarding
the project of carrying letter-boxes on its cars.
Three years ago the same scheme was mooted,
but Private Enterprise apparently thought,
judging by the price it demanded, that the
Government wanted to buy the whole outfit, and
no. business was done.
The arrival of a first instalment of 15,000
out of 50,000 cases of apples now being imported
to Victoria from
America throws
some light on the
shocking waste-
fulness of Private
Enterprise. The
apples are want-
ed, and willdoubt-
. less sell all right,
chiefly because
last season Aus-
tralia exported
£200,000 worth of
the fruit. The
needless export-
ing agent at that
time rushed
around gathering
in apples to send
away, so as to
collar a commis-
sion of 3d. a case
or thereabouts ;
then, having
created a scarcity,
he is now rushing
around collecting
apples to import
—at about the
same commis-
sion. So Aus-
tralia has to pay
an utterly super-
fluous middleman two wholly unnecessary com-
missions, not to mention a whole lot of totally
redundant freights. Still, the “trade” figures
will mount up, through the unnecessary exports
and the consequent superfluous imports ; and
there are some people who think that big foreign-
trade figures are the one test of prosperity.

He found the associations were called the Women’s
Anti-Socialistic Organisations, and they were bound to-
gether naturally by a desire to oppose the growth and
progress of this Socialistic propaganda.— W. 11. Irvine to
the Women’s Anti-Sosh League.
“The woman’s place is the home,” remarked Mrs.
Berry (Bendigo), in introducing a paper upon the same
subject. The state of woman under extreme Socialism
was too horrible even to contemplate. No secret was
made of the fact that under Socialism there could be no
religion, no morality, no loyalty, for there would be no
King, Queen or Governor. — Mrs. Berry.
Brethren and Sistren—especially Sistren—
X have a few remarks to make, to offer, to obtrude—
Yea, certain curious and speculative theories to propound
unto you :
I desire also your sympathetic attention while I describe
several Horrible Possibilities,
And intermittently afford your bulging eyeballs glimpses
of a Nawful Warning !
But in the first place I call upon you to awake and arise
and abjure Sosh and all his works —
Which thing having been done, effected and proclaimed
may be taken as understood.
There is but one Anti-Sosh, and Irvine is her Prophet!
(Vicefe Fat Politician, Busted, Tired and Very Much Dis-
credited, but aware of the Fact that life is Brief.)
Now Brethren and Sistren—particularly Sistren—lest you
be mystified or dissatisfied—
Puzzled, tangled up, or transmogrified—
Be it repeated, coram populo,
There is but one Anti-Sosh, and Irvine is her Prophet! ”
Conversely, there is but one Irvine, and Anti-Sosh is his
Profit!
It is he, the Enigma, Frigid, Dilettante, Detached—who
speaks to you—
You , Sistren, the Devotees of the Ddcolletd —the sworn
upholders of royalty, loyalty, and lawn or linen

With other fine old Traditions of chiffon, mousseline-de-
soie and pate-de-foie-gras —
Invincible Prejudice instructing Incredible Ignorance !
He and you, my Sistren, shall yet save the People—
The large, hairy, common, unroyal, disloyal, immoral and
vulgar People !
Ugh!
It is a Job—a Big Job—my Sistren, but you will see it
through,
For you are the Glassy Agates—the Last Words in People-
saving !
I see you—noble, puissant, embonpoint and a la mode—
rallying round the Throne and Person—
Especially the Person ;
I behold you, Sistren, a band of virgins and others in high
conclave assembled, clamant, fremescent, complete—
I mark you, each a female Theseus, following the mental
convolutions of Ariadne Spruce Myth’s argument,
And I salute you !
I note with breath-suspending interest the Horror that
assails you at the mention of, the unguarded refer-
ence to —
SOCIALISM ! ! !
I observe your pneumonia-blouses heaving—
Your plumes trembling—
Your features convulsed with agonised apprehension—
Your nods, your glances, your rustlings, your pince nezs
aflash with indignation ;
I hear your murmurs, your sniffs, your suppressed chorus
of approbation and reprobation, your applauses and
your sighs ;
Swiftly I follow the passage of vinaigrette from the
Vanity Bag to the nostril, and the sensuous curve of
perfumed fans ;
And I am lost in admiration ; in contemplative adoration!
Then my soul exults and my sinking spirit soars again :
And I say to myself— lt is Irvine ;it is Myth; it is Anti-
Sosh Incarnate ; it is well!
And I look and recognise you, my Sistren, occupied in
your colossal task of saving the People—
The large, common, hairy, unworthy, ungrateful and un-
pleasant People !
And I salute you !
You are saving the Throne—
You are saving the Person—
You are saving Religion—
You are saving the ’Ome—•
You are saving the (nearly) Busted Marriage Tie—
You are saving Women from Something-Too-Horrible-To

You are saving the King, Queen, Governor, Loyalty,
Morality, and Adolphus Bent—
That is to say, you are saving—the People. Eh ?
Exactly.
And I salute you I

He loves it! He loves it! And, so, e’en yet,
Though the times are hard and the outlook’s blue,
He clings to the wreck of his Cabinet
For the sake of one precious, golden screw.

With the battered thing though it cannot stand,
For the axe-scarred boards are dear to his heart—

A WOMAN’S LETTER.
Sydney, November 10, 1008.
My Dear Arini,—
Down in Melbourne they were still discussing
Lady Dudley’s face. About her figure there is
no second opinion. It is a pretty, graceful,
slender possession, and of good height. That a
controversy should rage about her face is quite com-
plimentary to the lady. It proves the exceptional
character of its type of beauty. The Hebrews
claim it as Israelitish in type. But the Gentiles
won’t allow that claim, and, for want of a better
word to express their meaning, call it “foreign.”
Personally, I’d employ the word “exotic” to
describe it, using the word in its most exclusive
sense. If you saw the Dudley lady’s portrait on
an Egyptian coin, with an inscription in cuneiform
characters, you’d look at it long and intently and
wonder (if you were so illiterate as not to be
familiar with cuneiform writing) which Pharaohess
(I suppose that is correct) of the Nile this might be.
A better face for one who has to stand the gaze
of thousands could not be. It is serene and
enigmatical as to eyes and mouth—the tell-tale
features. The brilliant eyes are young, but give
a suggestion of having looked upon the world
millions of years ago—of having come up through
many ascensions. Your Akenehi hastens to the
conclusion that “or ever the knightly years
had gone with the old world to the grave” the
G.-G’ess was a queen in Babylon or maybe a
beauteous Greek slave, wearing her chains grace-
fully in Carthage.
Mayor and Mayoress Hughes, of Sydney, took
the Dudley eye considerably, and were every-
where pushed on the raised eminence where many
are cold but few are frozen, as Mrs. Wiggs says.
One of Mrs. Hughes’ race garbings was of soft
silk in the new and awfully becoming shade known
as vanilla. A dress-authority tells me that Mrs.
Philip Morton also upheld Sydney’s status by her
frocking and huge hatting.
The valuable Byron Moore pair were out of the
Cup festivities this year, although he had perforce
to remain in the Cup strenuosicies. A death in
the clan has put the family into mourning. As
for Flemington, it grows more begarlanded and
decorated every year. “ Without the crowds and
the horses,” quoth Ada Crossley, as she trailed
her green chiffons and planted her green shoes on
the green grass (just a few blades of the grass, for
she has small supports), “ this would be the show
place of its kind in the world.”
Miss Ola Humphrey has her mommer with her
—a tall, slight lady, with beautiful red hair and
the dead-white complexion that often goes with
such Cleopatra-ish tresses. And she’s the smartest
dresser who decorates Melbourne to-day. Mrs.
Humphrey will accompany her Ola J. through
Maonland when the Melbourne season ends with
December.
When in Melbourne I saw for the first time the
commercial graphophone—or dictophone. Conti-
nental tyres Edwardes owns it. Oft in the stilly
night, when slumber’s chain has bound other
humans, the C.T. man returns to his office, and,
sitting calmly back in a chair with arms folded,
he speaks his business or other letters into the
mouthpiece or receiver of an instrument that
looks like a cross between a gramophone and a
typewriter. In the morning comes the typist,
puts the ear pieces of the dictophone about her
head, places a foot on the bulb of a rubber cylinder
lying on the floor, and the machine starts to re-
peat distinctly all it has been told the night
before. Its talk is shut off at will by releasing the
pressure on the rubber bulb. That gives the
typist time to catch up.
From Saturday’s S. M. Herald :
Friday, Melbourne.—The Governor-General and Coun-
tess of Dudley'entertained a large number of guests at a
garden party at Government House. Fine weather pre-
vailed.
The “ fine weather prevailed ” statement gave
me a good laff. I left Melbourne while Mel-
bourne and part of Sydney were going to, or
coming from, that garden party, and it was
principally the “fineness” of the weather
that drove me thence. Friday would certainly
have been a fine day in Hades. It would have been
a good frying day for the worst souls. At Spencer-
street, just before the departure of the express, I
reckoned that the famous Flatiron Building of
New York must be missing from its location and
that I was wearing it for a hat. I begged the
sympathetic friends who were saying good-bye to
me to get cranes and hydraulic lifts to take off my
“hat.” That was the kind of heat it was. It
weighed like a row of roast Alps on the weary
dome of thought. True, I struck a one-hundred-
and-one day in the shade in Sydney when I
arrived, but at least I breathed air. It was hot
air, if you like, but not boiling vapor.
On Melbourne Derby Day, at about 10 a.m.,
Menzies’ bedroom corridors presented, not a
brilliant appearance, but a humorous sight. On
the mat outside each door lay a big
costumiere’s box marked “ Immediate.” If
there was one boxless mat either the
woman on the other side of it was growing
paralytic with fear lest it should remain unencum-
bered, or else she had got up early and dragged
her box inside. A star artiste staying at the hotel
had bought a “little frock” the evening previous,
and left it for some slight alteration. It was one
of those “simple” imported coat-and-skirt things
the market value of which would be about three
guineas, but the cut and the name of the HOUSE
from which it came raised its value to ten and a
half guineas. The HOUSE vowed by all its
high prices that the little frock would be
at the hostel by eleven, as the artiste had
an appointment at twelve, and she was
quite convinced (after the manner of women
who have tons of clothes) that she would have
nothing to wear but the promised raiment. At
eleven o’clock every employee of the hotel who
had anything.to do with the route from the hall
door to room 60008 had been warned—almost
threatened—to look out for the box and hurry its
arrival. Then the artiste and a sympathetic
friend sat in room 60008, their watches in
their hands, and waited. Not a sight or sound of
a box. At a quarter to twelve the artiste literally
flung herself into a street frock, and skewering on
her hat, she and her friend dashed out —and fell
headlong, and did three yards rapid travelling on
all fours by reason of the fact that the box was
reposing on the mat. The occupant of the adja-
cent cubby-hole (6001 B) said the box had been
there quite a while. "It was one of those occasions
on which women find it impossible to be really in
tune with the infinite.
The ancient game of “ gowf ” has entered upon
a period of renaissance locally since the arrival of
the new Governor General. The club at Rose
Bay has been regarded hitherto by many of our
haughtiest as a mere place for tea and talk.
All that is now changed. Contemporaneously
with the discovery that both the Dudley Earl
and his Countess are expert propellers of the
haskell, fair young matrons who would have seen
their lawful hubbies blowed before they (the
matrons) took to golf at their (the hubbies’)
request, started practising long drives and short
“putts”; and plain old spinsters did the
same. The female loyalist may be identified
just now by her sun-disfigured nose and the blis-
ters on her hands. A golfing friend tells me that
the above-mentioned efforts are so much wasted
energy. It is impossible to become a “gowfer”
of merit at short notice. But hope springs
eternal in the Government House worshipper’s
breast, and the shops that stock cleeks, mashies
and such like weird engines are benefiting accord-
ingly.
It is rumored with ihuch definiteness and a
wealth of detail that Mr. Willie Lawson, of this
State, is engaged. Wherever the rumor goes it
leaves in its wake a crowd of disconsolate chorus-
maidens. The number of stage ladies here and
elsewhere who have dreamed fondly of the possi-
bility of drawing William’s number in a matri-
monial consultation is tremendous. The pros-
pective bride is an American widow, and she is
alleged to possess “six thousand a year.” A
carking doubt obtrudes as to whether the six
thousand has been estimated in English sove-
reigns, Yankee dollars or Brazilian reis. The
so vereign basis connotes luxury, the dollar suggests
comfort, the rei promises penury. A hat-pin
costs a thousand or so in the land of the rei; and
a millionaire in those disappointing coins is liable
to find himself on the financial rocks if he gets his
hair cut or has a tram-ride. The only time a
sackful of reis comes in handy is when a Hospital
Saturday embroglio is in progress. This, how-
ever, by the way. The widow and her William
are both in London, vyhere the latter has a flat,
a motor-car, and other desirable assets.
Captain Lumsden, R.N., who arrives in Sydney
this week as relieving officer of the Australian
Squadron, is a kind of a semi-Australian, inasmuch
as he wedded pretty Miss Fitzgerald, of Mel-
bourne. He had bad luck with his ship a while
back. The craft butted, or was butted by, another
in a howling Channel gale, and sank. The cap-.
tain did the usual old stunt of standing by the
floating object to the last, and so forth, and won
fervent press and other encomiums for his bravery.
However, as it is the way of the British Admiralty
to presuppose that its officers are infallible, and to
leap on them whenever Fate demonstrates that
they aren’t, the captain went down somewhat at
the subsequent inquiry. He and his wife will be
greeted with cries of joy in Melbourne, where they
are immensely popular, and with scarcely less
uproar here.
Miss Sadie Lukin, third daughter of Mr.
Gresley Lukin, editor of the Wellington (M.L.)
Post, was married last month to Mr. Alexander
Caw, of Auckland.
Captain Reynolds, of the Australian army, the
fathom of soldier-man who, a couple of years
back, married Miss Adams, of North Sydney, has
just been ordered to Aldershot for two years, to
learn some more about the art of war. Until a
short time ago the Reynoldses were stationed on
the outskirts of civilisation at Thursday Island.
A brother to the military man has just been
called to the Congregational Church at Wool-
lahra, which is an edifice thought much of in
pious circles. His wife was a Miss Lees, daughter
of a one-time Mayor of Sydney.
Nurse Bradley, for a number of years connected
with a private hospital at Darlinghurst, and just
now travelling “abrawd,” is about to enter the
matrimonial state for the second time. The
groom-elect is something.brass-mounted and im-
portant in the British army. The future home of
the pair will be Anglesey, an island off the coast
of the land of collieries and eisteddfods.
British periodicals take the clothes of their
heroes—statesmen, actors, murderers, and so forth
—with portentous seriousness. The wedding gar-
ments of Winston Churchill gave the press con-
siderable pain. Here is a description by a London
weekly of the distinguished bridegroom’s coat
It was not a success. It did not suit him. It was too
long and too heavy as a morning coat, and too short and
skimpy as a frock ; it was one of the greatest failures as
a coat"we have seen, giving the wearer a sort of glorified
coachman appearance.
The rest of his trousseau was little better. The
following blighting inventory of it was jotted
down by a disgusted newspaper man
The vest worn was a light fancy S.B. style; and the
trousers were made of a neat grey striped cloth, and cut
rather narrow in the legs. Wing collar, bow tie, and silk
hat with mourning band completed the outfit. We sin-
cerely hope our tailoring readers will advise their cus-
tomers not to adopt this style.
The Daily Mail regarded Winston’s costume
as in the nature of a national reproach. It inter-
viewed the offender’s tailor, who delivered him-
self of the following guarded remarks
Mr. Churchill, as a customer, has a distinct indivi-
duality. He carries the strong personal note of his collars
into every detail of his dress. For a man of his age he
affects a somewhat elderly style in clothes. The
fiat-topped felt hat which be wears, for instance, is a type
of headgear usually not assumed until the further side of
50 is reached. Mr.' Churchill gets his clothes here, there
and everywhere, and I am not prepared to assume
responsibility for the coat which is the subject of adverse
criticism.
The trader was pressed to be more explicit, but
grew restive, and finally returned to his board and
plunged into gloomy silence. It is generally con-
ceded that Winston’s clothes are unworthy of a
demi-Englishman and a gentleman.
The Newbury-Spada combination has evidently
hit the public taste, right in the middle. At last
week’s concert Madame Spada was encored for the
Bach-Gounod “Ave Maria,” with organ and
violin accompaniment, but her voice, though very
sweet, is hardly sufficient to fill the Town Hall.
Mr. Newbury, who had been confined to his bed
for some days with sciatica, rose for the occasion,
and sang the Poet’s Song from “La Boheme,” for
which he was encored. Others assisting were
Percy Scott (who has commandeered half the
alphabet to tie on to his name) on the organ, Estelle
Mabel Ward, whose songs were occasionally very
flat, Reginald Neild, Henri Staell on the violin,
and the only Sykes on the piano. (This reads as
if the entertainment concluded with a grand
tableau of the performers on their various instru-
ments, but it didn’t.)
Sydneyites will regret exceedingly to hear that
Mr. Henry L. Jones, sometime representative for
Andrew Carnegie in Australia, and sometime
Vice-Consul for Uncle Sam in Sydney, has lost
his wife at Denver, Colorado (U.S.A.), the moun-
tain centre where the weak-chested gather from
far distances in search of health.
Several of Leschetizky’s pupils are dotted over
Australasia; and these must take a retro-
spective interest in the doings of their old
master, who has lately married No. 4. Awhile
ago I read a capital short story by an
TT.S. scribe, and was assured by a country-man
and friend of the writer that the central personage
of the tale (one Herr Klug) was founded on Les-
chetizky. A girl pupil of Herr Klug does the
telling. “The old monkey had forgotten,” she
says, “that he had introduced me to a Frau Klug
two days before. In a minute I heard the swish
of silk skirts, and a fine-looking old lady entered,
and I was introduced to Frau Klug, please. I
nearly fell over, for I remembered well the
frightened-looking German girl—a pretty girl too,
only dressed rotten. Every time the old fool tries to
kiss me I ask him to introduce me to his wife, and
he invariably answers ‘ What, you have not met my
wife ? ’ and rings for the ugly servant, who stands
grinning until I really expect her to say ‘ Which
one?’ But she never does. I’ve counted 17
so far —all sizes, ages, and complexions. The
class says they are old pupils who couldn’t pay
their fees, so old Kluggy got a mortgage on them,
and they have to stay with him until they work
off the mortgage by sewing, washing, cooking and
teaching beginners. I’ve not seen them all yet,
and AnneSypher, from Cleveland, swears there is
a dungeon in the house full of girls from the
eighteenth century, who hadn’t money enough to
pay for their lessons. We girls have grown so
sensitive on the subject that we never walk out in
a crowd. The young men at the corners call out,
4 Hello, there goes the new crop for 1902.’ ”
Miss Maggie Knight is playing Mrs. Hardcastle
in “She Stoops to Conquer,” in Melbourne, and
playing it deliciously in hoops, powder and
patches. And the Tony Lumpkin of the piece is
a joyous lout, with a smile like an earthquake
rift. Beatty and Miss Mclntosh play as if they
detested their rdles. Perhaps they do, for the
pair, versatile as they may be, are misfits as Mar-
lowe and Kate Hardcastle.
From London
Ten years ago Melba was sending a flock of wandering
carollers from Australia to Marches! To-day, she is not
sending anyone to Marchesi. The hint gathers strong in
musical Maida Vale that Melba is going to start a School
of Song herself. Why? Well, the gorgeous but volcanic
Diva wants lucre. Her needs call fora larger income than
she is at present earning. Her expenses are enormous.
She lives like a Rothschild. A School of Song would bring
her in enormous fees.
Haddon Chambers is still the lion of the Melba Smart
Set. No one presents so feeble an appearance, but no one
flashes more into the brilliancies of wit, the whimsicalities
of speech, the paradoxes of the playwright, and Melba
unreservedly loves the fun he creates for her circle.
Widow Hickman Molesworth has determined not to
return to her Hawthorn (Vic.) house. With her girls
and her weeds she travels about, teaching the maidens
the mystery and history of Europe before settling them
in a flat at Queen’s Gate or Earl’s Court. The married
Molesworth chick is at present a grass-widow, her colonel
being at his Indian post—but presently she joins him
plus (they sav) a small family link.
The engagement of the daughter of Malcolm M’Eacharn
with a St. Petersburg cavalier is said to he off.
What is alleged to be a genuine “Sir Joshua
Reynolds ” is hanging on a Melbourne wall just
now. It is a portrait of. Governor Lord, one
time of Tasmania. The present owner’s lawyer
happened to see the heirloom hanging in the
usual dark corner of the customary out-of-the-
way apartment; and, being a dabbler in art, he
pointed out that for every week the owner let the
painting hang there he was sacrificing a sum in
interest sufficient to keep a dozen families in tram
fares for a calendar month. (This lawyer was
something of a lightning-calculator as well as an
art-dabbler.) The owner hurried off with his
treasure and tried to sell it. However, he failed ;
so it is now back in the dark once more, swallow-
ing tram fares for all it is worth and eating its
head off with compound interest. It is just possi-
ble* after all, that it isn’t a Reynolds, in which
case it is less ruinous. If all the old Masters hang-
ing on the walls of our stately homes were what
they purport to be, the lock-up of wealth would
be something terrible.
Till I dug this out of a London publication I
had always fancied that the mere female was the
only one who went in for face-decorating :

Conceive the anaemic London clerk or shophand
(this type it is that hankers madly to be handsome
and strong and sun-tanned and daring) standing
before a glass in his attic, with the cold river mist
surging against the window panes and a pea-soup
fog pervading everything, earnestly sun-bronzing
his pallid countenance. The tragic spectacle of
Merely Mary Ann trying to look, on her afternoon
out, like the Duchess of Mount Limejuice, as
limned in the Daily Mail serial, is nothing to it.
Yours Affectionately,
AKENEHI.
The new Bananaland Ministry is a fine
team of acrobats, but Digby Denham, the in-
furiated butter man, is the champion performer.
It was he who, nine months ago, denounced the
chief he now serves under as “the greatest
renegade and most ungrateful dog in Queens-
land.” Digby Butterfat followed Philp. He left
him to serve in the Ministries of Morgan and
Kidston. He left Kidston and went ba'ck to
Philp. Now he is back with Kidston. And
where he Will be next no man knoweth. There
are bets that Digby will ultimately be a Conserva-
tive Anarchist or a Revolutionary Fossil.
In Queensland, Kidston is trying to
Smother the fires that blaze around his mad
coalition by kindling a State Frights bonfire. In
reply, ex-Treasurer Airey announces that the
Federal Treasurer has treated the States well, and
that, on the whole, the Australian Government’s
finances have been economically administered.
“The cry of State Rights is being raised,’ Airey
says, “to enable representatives of the old Con-
servative party to slip into the Federal House at
next election, and I hope that the Democracy nar,
| its eye on the move.” It is well that at least one
; good Democrat has his eye on the move.
N.S.W. Railway Commissioner Tom John-
son resuscitated the dead at the tramway inquiry
the other day. Said Johnson bodingly :
That very morning' a friend of mine who had come out
from the Old Country with the object of establishing a
new industry remarked to me on the uncertainty that
existed here, and the difficult}' that existed for people in
the Old Country to embark their capital in the State
owing to the possibility of industrial disturbances.
Johnson apparently doesn’t know that the un-
named citizen, with the huge but unspecified bag
of gold, and the earnest but unidentifiable eye fixed
on an industry which is not mentioned, has been
corpsed and buried for years past. The digging
up of that silly old ghost is sheer foolishness.
“ Jean Sibi ” : I think He Who Burneth
Tobacco in the Middle of his Face and bosses the
Victorian railways, is going to make up for the
exes, of the Sunshine disaster by the practice of
rigid economy. At the Noradjuha (Vic.) railway
station, a nipper, giving his age as 16, is perform-
ing the entire duties of station-master, and
when you lift his salary you find it is on weight-
for-age conditions. If he should be found to be
too expensive, he will presumably be replaced by
an infant in a bib.

your distress. To start with, you should feed your face

“ Red Tape Junior ” :
A rather singular measure is the Superannuation Bill
just put through N.S. W. Assembly by Wade. In 1895
Reid’s P.S. Board sacked a horde or two of public ser-
vants. Some of them were aged cronies who were just as
well sacked any way. Many of them were paid a cash
gratuity for being sacked, but in 1899 Parliament passed
a Superannuation Act ( there are about a million Super-
annuation Acts), giving these old Johnnies pensions on
condition that they refunded the gratuities, which they
couldn’t, as the gratuities were all spent; so it was agreed
that their pensions would be paid less an annual deduc-
tion to make up for the gratuities they had received. It
was difficult to decide on this annual deduction. If it
were made too small, and the old fellows died in a hurry,
the Government would lose. If the aged folk hung on to
the mortal coil for a long time, the pensioners were liable;
to lose through refunding more gratuity than the
gratuity they had received. The actuaries studied
their tables; then they studied the pensioners; and
finally they reckoned all the pensioners as good
as dead in about eight or nine years. The annual deduc-
tion was fixed accordingly. But some of the pensioners
have declined to die according to table, and are still
alive. The arrangements for the refund of the gratuities
didn’t say that the refunds were to stop when the
gratuities were repaid in full, because if the pensioners
died after paying only one instalment to the refund, the'
Government couldn't recover the balance. Some of the
old Redtapes now see that by going on living after refund-
ing the whole of their gratuity they are steadily losing
money, and they are quite nasty because they didn’t see
it in time. Hence the Bill, which is to stop these deduc-
tions as an act of grace, and in return the old Red-tapes
are to agree not to pursue any other claims they may
.have,against the State.

MELBOURNE CHATTER.
Melbourne, November 9, 1908.
My Dear Yarrik,—
The two garden parties of the week were the
gubernatorial blow-outs. The Carmichaels filled
Stonington grounds to their most elastic capacity
with a crowd that practically proclaimed the
policy of “ Let ’em all come.” There are so many
people who must be asked some time and who are
not of importance, and the garden party will bag
the whole lot. But even gardens begin to choke
and suffocate at some limit. The Importants this
year are so many, to begin with. It’s a long time
since we had so many Cup jaunters, and the
wifely remnants of the Medical Congress are here,
even if the majority of husband has seen fit to
return to the sinking patient who produces the
necessary guinea.
The Governor-General’s gathering in the open
was on Friday. The Gov’ment House grounds
are beautifully spacious, and the day was hot.
Also the crowd was not so all-embracing and huge
as at Stonington. On the lawn frocks trailed
about like princesses in a fairy tale, and the soft,
sheathv silks, with their glidy tails on the terrace,
looked like peacocks. That terrace, with its old
grey fountain and water lilies, makes an excellent
background for pretty women. The countess
looked like a very young girl. She wore a simple
white muslin garden frock that did not trail, and
a wide, flat hat piled with camellias. Also
camellias were pinned in her dress. Lady Dudley
has brought the art of simplicity of dress to
perfection. Mrs. Hore-Ruthven, a dark, pretty
girl in heliotrope muslin, played about with the
small Dudley boy, who is a jolly youngster. The
other children were not in evidence, and young
Hopeful also was soon whistled to cover. The
Carmichael Governoress was cool in white, whilst
the Chief-Justicess Madden looked like Dresden
china, in blue. One Madden maiden was equally
conspicuous in purple, a striking contrast to
another in white lace. The dress of this year,
when it does not run to the tightness of ex-
aggeration or the grotesque, is soft and clinging
and silky—of young colors that have not grown
into a blaze. Mrs. Reid, wandering about with
her affable Yes-No, trailed a masterpiece
of painted chiffon. There were crowds of
Sydney women. Mrs. Herbert Marks wore
black, with a belligerent black hat well
down in the horns, and the two startling
Anderson girls were dressed like gypsies, one of
them having a fringed shawl draped round her
long perpendicularity. The creamy dress of Mrs.
Lawyer Coyle (who is staying with the Senator
Keating family) had rosette pink empurpling it.
Mrs. Keating’s dress was softly simple white, and
a top decking of plumed black hat; whereas Mrs.
Bob Whiting arrayed herself in dark blue for one
of the first outings since her illness. White
muslin, by the way, was as much in evidence as
iii an old-time novel, and Mrs. Jack Winter
Irving looked a nineteenth century garden dream
in her snowy gear.
The Princess’s Theatre and “The Prince of
Pilsen ” garnered in an amazing crop of Governor
on Thursday night after the Oaks. Every
Governor and Governoress we have in Mel-
bourne was there. There was the charming
little Countess lady, blazing in jewels, and
her proud Dudley G.-G. alongside; Governor
Carmichael and Lady Carmichael, who posi-
tively winked with rubies; and the Chelms-
fords, and the Rawsons, and all their satellites
also decorated the scene. The circle was so
full of aides, that you couldn’t have thrown
a scent bottle promiscuously without hitting one.
The theatre rose to the heights of a blazing eoat-
of-arms in the centre circle, and garlands of pink
roses swarmed from the pit to the gods, and the
Princess’s pretended it was command night at
Covent Garden.
On Wednesday night, after the sensation and
excitement of Cup Day had subsided, the
Dudleys gave a ball. Such a gorgeous ball !
There was a new staff of aides, a new cham-
berlain, and quite an extraordinary outburst of
inter-State visitors. Some Federal members’
wives got overlooked in the wild rush,
and it was only after frantic telephoning and
wholesale wrecking of family tempers that the
delayed cards arrived, carried valiantly on the
spike of an orderly’s lance, and prodded into the
house of turmoil from a safe distance. One
can scarcely expect the irreproachable Share’s
place to be tilled perfectly at the first
time of asking. The right people all got
there, nevertheless, and wore their most beauteous
gowns. Whatever the process resorted to
by the up-to-date, well-dressed woman, she has
mostly acquired the svelte figure (to use a word
out of the ancient modern novel), and she glides
in all the grace of soft pale silks. Some dames,
however, have reached only part-way. The
Weedon dame, indulging in a sheath dress, is too
luscious of charm. Pale gold satin was draped
tightly round her ample curves. I believe the
dress is an exact copy (except in measurements)
of one worn by Alexandra; the satin was even cut
from the same royal roll, this effect being arrived
at by the strenuous output of much influence and
coin.
George Reid was not allowed a sheath dress, of
course, because of his sex, but he indulged in a
sheath Court costume. The nether garments
were tight-fitting, of white satin, buckled at the
knee, and the coat was “cut away” (ye gods!),
and what there was of it was of gold satin and
gold braid. He wore an eyeglass and he entered
with the ponderous Lady Fysh on his arm. This
is a ball at Government House I am writing
about —not comic opera. Mrs. Yes-No Reid
fully compensated for her lord’s super-
fluities by gowning her slenderness in a
cloudy trailing effort of panned chiffon. The
Forrest dame wore a most youthful gown of white
and pearl. Mis. Isaacs was a startling poster in
black and white stripes that turned her slender-
ness to Mrs.-Eichorn-Cabbage-Patch proportions.
TbeGovernor-General and his Lady hostessed with
charming informality. The Countess dazzled in
pearls and rubies and diamonds, with soft white
draperies. Mrs. Hore - Ruthven —the aide’s
wife—who is a striking young Irish girl,
was dressed in very pale pink. Nearly
all the men folk came late, as the House was sit-
ting, and the ladies came early. Mrs. Deakin did
not put in an appearance at all. Mrs. Keating,
with cute little emerald shoes showing beneath a
white satin empire dress, brought Mrs. Barrister
Coyle, who wore opposition orange draperies.
There was a big crowd of Sydney visitors. Mrs.
Herbert Marks and Mrs. Motor Kelly came
together. Mrs. Kelly wore a shimmery white
dress that showed a great deal of dimpled
shoulder. Mrs. Sydney Isaacs was in black and
white, and her daughter was in elaborate gearing
for a debutante. Copenhagen blue was the foun-
dation for much frill and lace and furbelow.
Ruby Madden wore the new net sleeves to her
dress—they come right over the fingers like
mittens. Leslie Madden put on her blazing shot
blue corselet over her blue dress. One of the
Hammond Clegg girls was effectively clad in
pink and silver. There was rather too much girl
for the dress.
The part of Cup Day that is not soul-inspiring
racing is muchly a muddle of oddities. All the
beauty of Australia, in its best frock, goes out, of
course; but in the vast crush the beauties are
glimpsed or lost—it is the oddities that shriek
aloud and rise to the top of the turmoil.
One woman with the girth of an elephant and tile
shaping of an hour-glass saw fit to wear a grass-
green silk gathered full into the waist and cut
short at two thick ankles. Another held up the
awkward draperies of a red dress that showed a
short, black petticoat and a goodly glimpse of
scarlet stockings and blackshoes —ithad thestreaky
effect of a harlequin. Another dame who had heard
of the revival of Irish crochet lace surreptitiously
sneaked grandmamma’s biggest antimacassar
of bluish-white cotton heavily banked into circles.
She draped it over her mauve silk into a carica-
ture of the “new coat,” and sailed proudly to the
lawn. Amateurish attempts at the new sheath
dress were a joy—sheaths over any old figure
and any brand of bone-stayer. Thinking of
sheath dresses, a rumor went the rounds
that a particularly well-dressed, well-moulded
lady, who has been successfully exploit-
ing sheaths at all the race-meetings, in-
tended to appear in pink fleshings and black
velvet much decollete at the end where that kind
of thing is least expected. Cameras were got
into quick-work trim, and the stewards were
ready with a protest and if necessary an eviction,
but the lady (possibly forewarned) came demure
as a Quaker with a Quality-street frock and a
Quality-street air, stepping daintily in black-
banded shoes and white stockings.
In the crush, nevertheless, one glimpsed
some beautiful frocks. Mrs. Norman Armytage
turned out in a cool white linen, and daughter
Laura draped her slenderness in white shan-
tung Directoire cut. Mrs. Landale was a
smart black - and - white striped Columbine.
Maud Macintosh walked in impressive grace;
her emerald green shantung ran sheer down in
panels of black Cluny lace, and black head-gear
waved imperial plumes. The Bowes Kelly lady
had peachy silk gleaming under her lacy fur-
belows, and Mrs. Frank Clarke favored the
simple white muslin r6le, with a cut that liberates
some not so simple guineas. The blue and
gold box of Governors was packed full.
The Countess Governor Lady starred in a
simple dress, as usual—this time white grass
lawn and white hat and trappings. Mrs. Car-
michael looked like a bundle of cinnamon, and
quite as sweet. There was another Governoress
or so. A dumpy pink Miss Rawson glimpsed out
of the crowd. Mrs. Hore-Ruthven attired herself
in a cloud of tinted chiffon with good effect. The
Weedon lady was wrapped in aged tapestry,
fringe and all. Mrs. Philip Morton looked like a
highly-effective poster, in a pale ivory face and an
all red dress, with hat and shoes and portmanteau
to match. The new bags—called hand bags—
need a porter to carry them ; they are apparently
stuffed with a change of shoes and stockings in
ease the grass is wet. Tettie Appleton carried
one to match her green frock; ithad her silver
initials, and they were as large as a pawnbroker’s
sign. Mrs. McEvoy was a white vision, and Mrs.
Eugenie Duggan Anderson exploited the most
gorgeous lace frock, with enough interlinings and
foundations of silk and ninon and chiffon to keep
a hard-up family of girls in dance frocks for a
year.
Oaks Day—Ladies’ day—gave every chance for
the spread of peacock’s plumage at Flemington ;
but Steeplechase Saturday was wild and fresh
with the west wind. The geegees felt it, and ran
furiously with blown and dishevelled tails, but the
lawn was almost deserted. A few venture-
some women enjoyed themselves immensely in
the comfort of tailor-mades. There was
no dress of importance to catch their eye or rouse
envy in their be-tailored breasts, so they took
some joy in the sport. Not a solitary Governor
or Governoress, or suspicion of a satellite, went
out, and a posy of pink roses wept dejectedly in
the blue-and-gold box. The Mount Mitchell
Robertsons were out in full feather, and Alawa
had another win. Iceberg Irvine paraded the
lawn with his blue wife and a chooky bevy.
Irvine is losing all Iceberg caste nowadays. He
grows ruddy and as near rotund as his height can
allow. Also he takes on an amazing facial like-
ness to dead and gone Duncan Gillies. Mrs. Jack
Winter-Irving was prettily clad in blue Shantung,
entailored. Some of the smartest women had
their hair en chignon, most smoothly netted, and
their hats tied on with a ribbon bowed underneath.
It is a quaint and pretty style. Mrs. Ted Tait
wore a brown, soft dress with something Asiatic
about its embroideries, and Mrs. J. H. Tait was
in brown tailorings. Mrs. Eric Murray wore
cream serge, and Mrs. Tom Hogan was most
neatly attired in black. The Fenner girls were in
blue, and tailed about with Mrs. Raleigh.
People nowadays are wildly pointing out to
each other a certain young lady, and telling each
other that she is Miss Robertson —the “Miss
Gordon” who owns Alawa, the Derby winner.
“ Miss Gordon ” is her nom de horse, so to speak.
The Robertsons are very well known squatter
people. Mount Mitchell, beyond Ballarat, is a fine
woolly place, though it is nothing but a huge, windy
plain, with sheep and a racecourse for trimmings.
The house is a magnificent affair, ’but it stands,
gaunt and unhappily, on a bald patch of the estate
with scarcely a tree to shelter it. If only some-
one had poured hair-restorer on the estate all
round the house in bygone years, and alleviated
the hairlessness of things ! Just recently the elder
brother of the Robertson clan brought home a
wife, so the two sisters spend most of their time
in Melbourne. They have a flat in Melbourne
Mansions —that stately pile in Collins-street.
The racing Miss Robertson is a typical horse-
woman, lithe and straight as a riding whip, a
spare, powerful woman with a countenance made
in Scotland. The Vienna “did ” a big lunch for
her party at Flemington on Derby day, and a
supper at the cafe after the theatre that night.
The Vienna chef decorated his window with a
special cake, round which pretty sugar gee-gees
raced, with Alawa in the lead. And for his fore-
sight Air. Chef got a bottle of champagne all to
himself. Alas ! Alawa didn’t run away with the
Cup, nor did the lady owner look joyful after that
event. She was in the birdcage to see the defeated
favorite rubbed down, and as she stood there,
talking with the Frank Maddens and endeavoring
to look philosophical, her trembling hand told a
tale of agitation.
From “Rosna,” in Adelaide;—
Lady Le Hunte and Miss Clowes refrained from
Cupping this year, and stayed at home in the cool of the
Residence; but his Ex. and Aide Boddam- Whettom ran over
to Federal Government House for the week. They came
back just in time to hold a Birthday levee, and provide
Adelaide with an occasion for wiping the dust off its but
rarely used top hat—the one with the moth in it.
The death of young Mrs. Lavington Bony thon last week
Was a great shock to an unusually wide circle of friends.
Very real sympathy is felt for her mother, the widow of
eX-Premier, ex-Speaker, and ex-Agent-General John Bray,
whose almost constant companion she was. Mrs. Bony-
thon was only 26, and a charming and very popular girl.
She leaves three small kiddies, the youngest only three
weeks old.
Adelaide is being chopped up. If you want to cross
King William-street and haven’t a flying machine you
have to go up to Victoria-square, and down Angas-street,
along Hutt-street, round the York Hotel and up Bundle-
street, and you may get there eventually. But even that
isn’t certain. The other alternative is to plunge through
an army of dangerous-looking males with pickaxes and
horses, and probably get stamped into the electric tram-
way excavations before your sorrowing relatives can
realise it. A third idea, of course, now that I come to
think of it, is to take the train to Melbourne, and then go
up to Swan Hill, and approach the city on the other side
per Murray River steamboat and other conveyances. I
will do that next time.
We’ve been sung at till we’re nearly dead. The Bach
Society had one of its performances the other eve to the
usual crowded house, and it deserved the crowd. Hr.
Harold Davies guides the society in the way it should
Bach, and under his stick a*flock of white-robed maids
and magpie-clad men warbled “Daybreak” and “The
Challenge of Thor,” and other melodies, with the sym-
phony orchestra to help them. Their Excellencies
assisted the applause. The Liedertafel, not content with
its jubilant jubilee a month or two agone, also furnished
a blast of its best noise at the Town Hall; and, to wind
up, the Welsh Choir had a final burst of song at the
Exhibition, with 3000 folk fighting for clapping room.
There was a welcome home to Adelaide’s Bishop at the
Victoria Hall last week. The premises were arrayed in
roses and poppies and asparagus ferns. There was an
orchestra to provide relief from the inevitable few re-
marks, and Mr. Beeton and Ethel Hantke and sundry
other people sang an item a-piece. There was also quite
a festive little supper, and all the folk high up on the
ecclesiastical social ladder were there in their best clothes.
The affairs were most popular—it was such a blessed re-
lief to go and see a bishop without having to take three-
pence with you for the plate.
Margaret Anglin struck a heat wave of quite disrepu-
table magnitude for her first week here, wherefore she
took to a motor and honked into the hills to sit among
the orchids and the ti-tree. Her frocks and frills have
made Adelaide quite—well, nearly quite—wicked. That
dressing-gown in “The Thief”—the most heavenly fine
lace, with bands of pale pink glacb, showing billows of
Valenciennes and ribbons beneath ! If I had a dressing-
gown like that I could bear all my wrongs.
Yes, we’re really and truly and finally and irrevocably
going to have a new theatre. In fact, two or three are
threatened, but while the others threatened, lawyer
Hardy announced that an absentee client of his, who
owns much property hereabouts, had decided to build us
a playhouse in Grote-street.
The Lyric Club had a “ dramatic evening” last week.
A piece of “ Lady Huntworth’s Experiment ” (the piece
in which everybody proposes to the fascinating cook, and
all are found concealed in the broom cupboard and
pantry) was given amid much mirth. Miss Berry played
the fascinating cook ; Kathleen Sutherland, one of Ade-
laide’s prettiest maidens, was fearfully and wonderfully
disfigured as Keziah ; and Mr. Talbot Smith concealed
himself under the character of the pessimistic Mr. Gandy.
Kiosk parties are the thing. If you want to be very
new, you have a morning tea-party, and the guests dis-
port themselves upon the Botanic Garden lawns before the
heat of the day, which is a sane proceeding. The Jack
Creswellshad a kiosk party for the J. J. Bodleys before
they left for Britain, the other day.
A graduate of our little Varsity, Mr. T. B. Robertson,
B.Sc., has got himself appointed Professor of Physiology
at California University, and our cat’s tail has grown
another millimetre.
The Lewis Cohens, who have been sampling the Yarra-
side capital for a year, mean to return to South Oss after
all. Adelaide, which remembers their lavish hospitality
of old, will get up and wave its hat to have them back
again. If that is insufficient to express its feelings it will
also wave its boots.
In the Collins-street cafes seats were reserved on
race nights, and the scramble to book was like
unto the rush to the plan of a new comic opera.
After the theatre on Derby, Cup and Oaks
nights the suppers were amazing things. The
unfortunate every-Saturday-nighters who drove
pell-mell down from theatre to cafe, looked
like a swarm of bees whose hive had been
embezzled while they were out—crushing and
peering in with a faint hope of finding a stray table
where they might tear a bit of food and drink their
champagne in simple jollity. Lunches and teas,
of course, were out under the vines atFlemington.
One morning the Norman Bayleses gave a straw-
berry morning tea at the Paris to no less than 115
fashionables. It occurred at 11, and as the order
had only gone in at about 9 o’clock, Norman
Bayles himself was drawn into the work of help-
ing to get ready. He is everlastingly chummy
now with all the pretty Paris girls. He spent two
solid hours helping them to shell strawberries for
the push.
“Mario” writes from Brisbane:—
Our vice-regal family party will return on Tuesday from
considering the vain and unstable horse down south, and
will straightway go into the collar. He is entered for the
opening of the new Fire Brigade Station on Wednesday.
The old station was situated opposite the Central Rail-
way premises and in the midst of the traffic, and the
brigade’s motor came so near to running over a man and
a woman and two children and a dog every time it
rushed to the conflagration that the brigade’s nerves gave
way. Now the fire extinguishers have builded them a
temple lower down Ann-street, where the only thing they
can collide with will be All Saints’Church or the new
Anglican Cathedral. On Friday sundry dull but Import-
ant persons will dine at the vice-regal gunyah in honor of
the King, and on the following day such of the Federal
army as is available will spread its tail in the Domain.
The consular body came together in. an.official way on
Wednesday, and went a-sailing in the loaned Government
scow, together with half-a-ton of ice, some of the
“cratur,” several washing baskets of strawberries, cakes
and icecreams, and various public persons, including
Lieut.-Governor Morgan, fat Under-Secretary McDermott,
the Mayor, and others. Owing to European complica-
tions and a feeling that the Bohemian fleet may bombard
Dunwich at any moment, there were no speeches. The
proceedings served to introduce to Brisbaneites the
handsome wife of the reappointed Naval Commandant
Richardson.
Wednesday saw also an effective ceremony in the dingy
Supreme Court, when Mr. Justice Shand was officially
elevated to the Bench. Quite a number of womenfolk
came along. The popularity of the new Judge was
manifest by the smileful array of wigs that crowded rourid
the table. They literally overflowed, and the back view
of them provided an interesting study. There was the
neat E. M. Lilley (who might have been chosen if Mr.
Shand had declined with thanks). His orderly curls
hadn’t a hair out of place and were as tidy as his argu-
ments, and his gown was draped like a Paris model round
his elegant shoulders. The stoutsome Lukin, oh the
other hand, wore a tousled head-dress many sifcek
too small for him. It sat jauntily Upoh hik
bristling thatch, and his gown hung oil to 'One
shoulder like grim death. Peter Macgregor’s tails
were untidy, and suggested a breakfast table altercation.
Ex-Attorney-General Blair was as elegant 45 4 Sptihg
morning. The new Attorney-General wore a full-bottomed
contraption on his head. It fitted him all oVer ahd
touched him nowise—also it wobbled, ahd the more it
trembled the more he perspired. AS for the Judges, in-
cluding the C.J., their wigs showed quite pitiful evidences
of wear and tear. They looked especially shabby beSide
the bran new creation of Mr. Justice Shand, who wears
his parted in the middle.
The usual rush for the South has set in. The Dickson
ladies are already in your mountains. Mrs. J. A. Robert-
son goes the first week in December. Mrs. Herschfelt is:
also gone. The last of our Melbourne friends are busy
packing their muslins and airing their furs prior to flit-
ting. At Ascot this day, diaphanous frocks and frills were:
heavily in evidence, and seldom has the Queensland Derb>
been decorated by a bigger gathering.
Dark rumors rend the air of plaintiffs, defendants and
co-res., and a prominent public man is named as one or
the other ; but so far we hardly know which he is to be.
Yours affectionately,
JOHANNA.

Half-yearly Report of the Directors of the Bank of Australasia, with the Accounts for the half-year to 13th
April, 1908. Presented to the Proprietors at the half-yearly General Meeting, held on Thursday, Ist October, 1308.
REPORTm— ——
fill IK. Directors submit to the Proprietors the Balance Sheet as at 13th April last, with the Profit
J- Account for the half-year to that date. After providing for rebate on bills current, for British and colonial
rates and taxes, and for all bad and doubtful debts, the net profit for the half-year amounted to £212,029 6s. 7d.
To this sum must be added £16,074 15s. 3d. brought forward from the previous half-year, making a total of
£228,104 Is. 10d., out of which the Directors have declared a dividend for the half-year at the rate of 12 per cent, per
annum, or £2 Bs. per share, and a bonus of Bs. per share, free of income tax. p
The dividend and bonus will absorb £112,000, and the Directors have further appropriated £BO,OOO to the Reserve
Fund, and £20,000 in reduction of the cost of bank premises. There will then remain £16,104 Is. lOd. to be earned
forward to the next account. .
The dividend and bonus will be payable in London and in the colonies on 2nd October. ,
The subject of the amendment of the deed of settlement of the Bank, which is over 70 years old, was referred to
in the last report, and, in accordance with the notice, given, the extraordinary meeting necessary to authorise the
proposed amendments will be held after the business of the general meeting has been concluded. .
The present deed contains many provisions which are a distinct hindrance to the prompt carrying on of tne
business of the Bank ; it has, therefore, become necessary to have, in effect, a new deed of settlement more m
accordance with modern practice.
The Directors were anxious, if possible, to circulate among the proprietors a brief summary of the alterations,
but after careful consideration it was clear that any summary that was brief would be quite incomplete, and that,
without the necessary explanation, a summary, whether brief or full, might be considered misleading. Now as
mentioned in the notice of the extraordinary general meeting, an opportunity has been afforded to every proprietor
of inspecting and comparing the two deeds. T . , , , , thp
The Directors have to record, with sincere regret, the death of Mr. Alex. Lawrie, who had been a memliei of lhe
Board since 1893, and whose well-known business qualifications were of great service to the Bank. Mr. YY . Howard
Smith and Mr. Arthur Whitworth are candidates for the vacant seat, and the Directors have much pleasure in le-
eommending the election of Mr. Whitworth. . . ... , M p; , qalhv
The Directors also have to record, with much regret, the death after a lingering illness, of Mr. Prideaux Selby
formerly London manager of the Bank, who was appointed an honorary director on his retirement in 1898, after
thirty-nine years of valuable service. . , ~

Brisbane’s municipal control of the fish-supply
is turning out all right. The old Greek ring has been
crumpled up, and the public is getting a better and
cheaper supply. When municipal control was first pro-
posed by Premier Kidston, Private Enterprise said the
usual foolish things, but it is dumb as a curried prawn
now The fishermen are benefited as well as the con-
sumers, for they get better prices.. The Board takes
delivery of the fish at the railway, grades it, sells it by
auction, collects the money, and remits to the seller, less
the market charges. On the year’s transactions there is
a credit balance of £289. The problem yet to be solved is
the distribution. At present; it is in the hands of hawkers,
and there is room for a lot of improvement there. The
retail end of the problem is the tougher of the two, ana
probably won’t be solved satisfactorily until the muni-
cipality'takes the milk supply in hand and runs the fish
and ice business in conjunction with it.
In all the solemn and lengthy literature con-
cerning the Federal scheme for manufacturing coins and
cartridge cups with the same machinery, nothing is more
discernible than the deft, interested paw of the Colonial
Ammunition Co. This show, which already has a con-
ti act to supply the Government with cartridges, has all
along opposed the scheme, seemingly on the ground that
it wasn’t feasible. It couldn’t be done, ic said in a heavy,
assertive fashion ; and yet, in the next breath, it declared
that it could do the job at its own works at Footscray (Vic.).
The impudence of the suggestion was superb ; the co.
practically intimated that a private firm could do at its
works what the Commonwealth could not do at its own
Mint. Of course it was only shoving in a nnld little word
for itself ; but the surprising thing is the success with
which it shoved that word. Although the Commonwealth
scheme was the joint effort of Corbet and McKay, two
officials in the Perth and Melbourne Mints respectively,
and had received official endorsement from the London
Mint authorities, who declared that the processes of
punching discs for coins and of manufacturing cartridge
cups were similar and could be carried out at the same
works, the expert committee appointed to consider the
idea mostly condemned it. Practically the committee
adopted the ideas of a private and obviously interested
concern in entirety, and fired out the recommendations
of a bunch of Government officials who were probably as
expert and experienced as the committee was itself.

N.S.W. Lands Department got a mild shock,
the other day, when it sold some town and suburban lots
at Bowraville. When the sale was determined on it took
the office some time to locate Bowraville ; bnt the place
was ultimately discovered to be a one-goat village which
vou can reach occasionallv if the liar at the mouth of the
Nambucca River will let you. When the sale came on
an excited populace rushed it. Over £5OOO worth of land
was sold in a few minutes, one lot, 33ft. x 150 ft., fetching
£990. Few suburbs of Sydney could command such
prices as £3O a foot, and the Lands Department is expect-
ing to hear of diamonds or rubies growing in the Bowra-
ville paddocks. It is supposed to be the coming worth
Coast railway which caused the boom. If so, what sort
of unearned increment is awaiting the Gloucester estate,
which owns practically the whole frontage to the railway
section now actually under construction this side of the
Manning Biver?

For absolute interference with the liberty of the
subject and for shackling Private Enterprise and stop-
ping the life blood of commerce, the Anti-Sosh fruit-
grower takes the cake. The latest effort of the fruit-
rearing person is the National Fruitgrowers Conference
of all the States, which sat in Melbourne in October.
Said Conference spent all its time in devising means
whereby the Parliaments, Federal and State, could best
legislate in the interests of the orebardist from the
time he first plants his tree until the date when
the eater of the fruit has his appendix cut
out at the hospital. One suggestion was that
the Association should have power to levy an annual
registration fee of 2s. 6d. from all orchardists, an orchard
being defined as consisting of one tree or upwards. It
looks like a reckless attempt to raise revenue for the pro-
fessional fruitgrower at the expense of the multitudinous
suburban householder. .

“W.D.Y.”: Re “Alcohol from grasstrees’
(B. 1/10/’OS). A syndicate has got the consent of the
Victorian Lands Department to cut 100,000 acres of grass-
tree in the Heytesburv Forest for the purpose of obtain-
ing alcohol therefrom. This is portion of the grasstree
country where the Victorian Government last year
carried out successful cultivation experiments witn
fertilisers. Also, another large tract of grasstree country
at Carlisle Biver, about 30 miles from Colac (Vic.), has
been leased to one Harrison. He intends winning from
it a substance out of which he will manufacture varnish.
There are large tracts of grasstree in other parts of Vic.
Up to the present, they have been treated as waste land,
but after all there is no waste land—only waste people,
who don’t know how to use land.

The farmer appears to he the man who is to
have the opportunities of the future. German ingenuity
has just created a flourishing industry based on the sub-
stitution of mashed potatoes for wood in lead pencils.
Now comes news that from skim milk another German
has produced a substance closely resembling vulcanised
rubber or celluloid. It can be pressed into any shape, be
sawed, cut and polished. It is not affected bv oils,
grease, ether or benzine. It sells at from 2s. to 3s. Ju.
per lb. When the farmer’s milk fails to pass inspection
he can make it into sidecornbs or billiard balls, and when
his potatoes aren’t fit to eat he can choose between turn-
ing them into alcohol to run automobiles or lead pencils
for the promotion of knowledge.

So proudly on the, hill beyond
His new-built mansion wears
A hot-house and a lily-pond
And carpets on the stairs.
So sourly from the “ tradesman’s gate ”
Behind the carriage-way
The beggar, in his cringing strait,
Was turned hut yesterday ;
Now to this new-built mansion high,
From my despised abode,
Despite the beef-lord’s anger, I
Must dedicate an ode :
Adown the long historic ways
They stride with kingly tread,
The hundred wearers of the bays
Of all the millions dead.
Their world-compelling deeds are set
Above the tides of Time,
Their voices ring and echo yet,
In Halls of Thought sublime.
From Tiber ; from the Avon side ;
From hut or palace, they
Came forth and conquered, ere the Tide
Bore each in turn away.
The unremembered Dust of Years,
That once knew tears and smiles—
No Ear of all the living hears
Its Voice along the miles !
Dumb, nameless and for ever lost,
Entombed, onswept, ’tis gone—
A cipher in the total cost
Of one small Pantheon.
So, Mime, within your villa grand,
So, gilded parvenu.
The Rich are even mortal, and
The truly Great are few.
A thousand years and you and he,
To whom you did not give,
In equal nothingness will be —
But Euclid still will live.

m erit alone gained for the Beale Australian Pianos the highest prizes
awarded at the Franco-British Exhibition. It is the practice of foreign
piano-makers, when showing at an exhibition, to prepare highly ornate, specially-
designed instruments; but when we decided to send a few Beale Australian
Pianos to the Franco-British Exhibition we had no time specially to prepare any
instruments, even if we had wanted to do so. So we just took ten of our
ordinary models out of stock, packed them with the care with which we always
pack our pianos when sending them out, and sent them to London. IVe had never
before publicly shown our instruments in Europe, and the judges had never hitherto
met with them. Yet our Pianos secured the Grand Prix (the highest possible
award) “for tonal qualities and general excellence, gold medal “for perfection
of woodworkj and gold medal for inventions. Phe jury consisted of three Prench
and two British experts, and their judgment was unanimous. Phis triumph for
A ustralian industry was preceded by another striking evidence of the high quality
of the Beale Pianos. Messrs. Lyons & Co., proprietors of the Strand Palace
Hotel, now being erected, on the site of the old Exeter Hall, London, after careful
examination and testing oj our instruments at the Exhibition, ordered no less
than twenty .
In view of these facts, if you intend purchasing a piano, it would be to your
interest to call at our Showrooms and inspect the Beale Australian Pianos .
Over eleven thousand have been sold in every part of Australia, and in New
Zealand\ Fiji, Samoa, New Caledonia, Mauritius, India and Norfolk Island.
IVe have hundreds of testimonials from buyers in all walks of life. Our
catalogue and copies of testimonials will be sent free on request.

SPORTING
NOTIONS
This is the season when the man who didn’t
back the winner recalls the signs and portents which un-
availingly indicated the quarter where he should have
invested" the splosh. On Metropolitan day, 1907, the P.
and O. liner Mooltan arrived in Hobson’s Bay, and had
the assistance of a tug in the berthing operations. The
captain of the tug regarded it as an omen, and backed
accordingly, with lucrative results. On Metropolitan
day, 1908, the same old Mooltan arrived at the same old
port, and had the assistance of the same tug. Same
master, same tip, longer odds and better results. This
year the coincidence struck the master so hard in the eye
that he acquainted all his friends, and that evening they
went for a drink-swim. Another man got the straight
griffin to back Lord Nolan, but failed to take advantage
of it. The week before the race a friend of his, Sergeant
Nolan, was promoted to be an inspector ; and he pondered
whether he should regard it as an omen or not. He men-
tioned the fact to a friend, who immediately backed the
winner, and poked much borak at the man who had
missed his opportunity.
The saddest case of a tip that went astray this
writer ever heard of also happened in connection with
Dyed Garments. A woman in Potts Point (Sydney) re-
ceived the tip some time back that Post Town was a
“good iron,” and backed him at long odds. Then hearing
that Post Town was off she decided to back nothing
more. But on washing day the woman next door hoisted
a red blouse on her clothes line. When the lady who had
backed Post Town came to take in her washing she found
it liberally bespattered with red drops from the blouse in
the next yard. She regarded it as a certain omen,
mortgaged her furniture and plunged heavily on Dyed
Garments. To-day she is a sorrowful woman.
Thk Lone Hand magazine recently took on the
unusual role of tipping people what not to back. The
cover of the current number was printed away back in
April, and represented a horse, bearing on his saddle
No. 4, trotting riderless round the course. In the Metrop.
Plunder finished minus his rider, and in the book Plunder
w 7 as No. 4. In the Melbourne Oup No. 4 was Dyed Gar-
ments, and Dyed Garments fell and finished without his
jockey. Unfortunately, most Lone Hand readers who
regarded it as a tip backed No. 4 and fell in. It’s a sad
world.

This year’s Melbourne Cup was an unparalleled
facer to backers of the favorites. Alawa, at nine to four
in the betting, was not more certain—on paper—to beat
the other Derby colts than Peru (at three to one) was cer-
tain to beat Mooltan and Tulkeroo, who had finished
behind him in the Melbourne Stakes where they all car-
ried the same weight. Yet Mooltan gave Peru a stone
and a beating in the Cup, whilst Tulkeroo showed a
similar improvement on his form of three days before.
* * * *
Some of the excuses offered for Alawa’s defeat
in the Melbourne Cup were as absurd as the explanations
of Lord Nolan’s “ reversal of form.” One heard people
gravely protesting that the difference between Alawa
and Nolan in the Derby, and the difference between
Nolan and Alawa in the Cup was a matter of weight—
merely weight. The weight argument doesn’t bear close
inspection. Granting that the big Ballarat colt was
better able to carry Bst. 101 b. in the Derby than the
smaller colt from N.S.W., it must, also be conceded that
7st. 61b. for Alawa in the Cup was as light a burden com-
paratively as 6st. 91b. for Lord Nolan. It was not weight
that stopped Alawa in the 2-mile race, but want of
stamina. He carried only w.f.a., anyhow, whereas Mool-
tan had to hump 81b. more than w.f.a. Also Tulkeroo
gave the Derby winner 171 b. and a handsome
beating. As for Lord Nolan, his Cup perform-
ance was strikingly at variance with his failure
in the Derby, where he finished fully eleven
lengths behind Alawa. When Blinker, a few years ago,
finished out of a place in the Derby (but nearer to the
winner than Nolan got) and subsequently ran third for
the Cup, his owner, old “ Jimmy ” Wilson, was called be-
fore the V.R.C. stewards to explain this inconsistency of
form. There was exactly the same excuse of difference
of weight in Blinker’s case as in Nolan’s, but the stewards
saw nothing to enquire into when the latter actually won
the Cup, after cutting a wayback figure in a fast-run
Derb.y. Nobody would argue that Nolan with Bst. 101 b.
on liis back was equal to beating the bigger colt
in the Derby, but the w’ide difference between
winning by a nose and being beaten by eleven lengths
is not satisfactorily accounted for by the weights.
Lord Nolan’s performance in the Derby and Cup was
similar to that of Blinker four years previously. Blinker
finished fourth (level with Koopan) for the Derby, in
which Sylvanite, Lord Fitzroy and Billingsgate filled the
places, the winner being not more than four lengths
ahead of the unplaced pair. Blinker was reckoned the
best stayer of .this lot, and he was backed down to 16 to 1
for the Cup on the strength of his favorable handicap
weight. He carriedfist. 101 b. and finished a close third to
Acrasia and Lord Cardigan, the three-year-olds that had
beaten him in' the Derby being nowhere. Lord Nolan,
although placed third in the Derby, was eight lengths
behind the second horse. He carried 6st. 91b. in the Cup,
was backed down to 16 to 1, and turned the tables on the
Derby winner and runner-up, just as Blinker did. Auraria
in 1895 also won the Cup, after running third in the Derby
to Wallace and Osculator, but although the famous mare
was rather on the small side there was no talk of her
having been “crushed” by her heavier burden in the
shorter race. For that matter, the difference between
Auraria’s weight in the Derby and the Cup was only 151 b.
Tulkeroo, in running second for both the Caul-
field and Melbourne Cups, followed the lead of Devon in
1894. Other horses that got placed in both Cups were
Poseidon, who won the double ; Acrasia, who was second
and first; Vanity Fair, who scored a third and a second;
and Dewey, who was first and third. Also, in the long
ago (1887)," Silvermine filled the second place in both Cups.
Mool tan’s dropping back to fourth place in
Melbourne Cup, after he had come to the front in the run
home, seems to have been due to an injury. One of his
forelegs was pretty badly damaged in the final struggle,
or earlier in the race.
* * * *
The last day of Melbourne Cup meeting drew a
somewhat smaller crowd and provided better sport than
the Steeplechase Day of most years. A dead-heat between
Nigel and Seymour for the three-mile jumping event was
not more exciting than the finish for the V.R.C. Handi-
cap (If miles), in which four horses were so closely con-
cerned that the unplaced one got within half-a-length of
the winner. The O. B. Fisher Plate was a rattling go be-
tween Alawa, Peru and Pink ’Un, and the Final Handicap
established the character of lolaire as the most consistent
of all the speedy top-notchers who can carry weight up
to nine or 10 furlongs without tiring.
During the meeting the owners of Pink ’Un
requested the V.R.C. stewards to inquire into the recent
running of their horse, as though his defeats in the Caul-
field Cup and Melbourne Stakes had been unaccountable.
From the public point of view, this demand looked like a
satire —conscious or unconscious—on the inaction of the
stewards as regards the running of other animals. Pink
’Un, as far as the public has seen, lost the Caulfield Cup
because the distance was fully a furlong too far for him,
and this theory was endorsed last Saturday by the Maori-
lander’s failure to live with Alawa and Peru at the end of
a 12-furlong race. As for his defeat in the 10-furlong
Melbourne Stakes—well, he finished third (at w.f.a.) to
Peru and Mooltan, who had better luck in the running,
and are apparently a bit faster than he at the distance.
For the rest of his recent performances, Pink ’Un had
always proved himself excellent at a mile or nine fur-
longs. The demand for an inquiry seemed absurd on the'
face of things, and the stewards surprised nobody by
deciding that there was nothing to complain about.
On the other hand, the stewards were remark-
ably indifferent to sundry “reversals of form ” which did
cali for inquiry. Lord Nolan’s position at the end of the
Derby race —fully eight or 10 lengths behind Parsee, as
the photographs show it—was inconsistent with the colt’s
victory in the Cup. For that matter, none of the horses
behind Alawa and Parsee were ridden out in accordance
with the rule of the V.R.C-, a rule made only to be
broken. And again, it is not to be supposed that Lord
Nolan could have won the Derby. It is merely obvious
that he dropped back in the straight like a non-stayer,
whereas staying is his forte. But the inconsistency in
this case was trifling in comparison with that of King’s
Cross. Consider the four performances of King’s Cross
at the recent V.R.C. meeting. The four-year-old ran
firstly in the Maiden Plate, a w.f.a. race over a mile. He
went out at 20 to 1 offered in a big field. He brought up
the rear in the first half of the journey, and finished
eighth, amidst a crowd of rotters. This was on Derby
Day. In the Melbourne Cup, where he seemingly got a
bad run most of the way, King’s Cross finished sixth.
And, despite his having started at 20 to 1 for a maiden
plate, he was backed at 33’s for this great event in which
he ran so respectably. Two days later he won the Veteran
Stakes, over 1£ miles, in record time, and again two days
later he won “the V.R.C. Handicap, carrying 7st. 10lb.,
and beating Tulkeroo, Delaware, etc. Yet the V.R.C.
stewards saw no reason for an inquiry into the reason
why King’s Cross had been a despised outsider and a bad
performer in the Maiden Plate on the first day' of their
meeting! * * *
Old Emir, the sensational Derby failure of five
years ago, concluded his erratic turf career in the
V.R.C. Handicap. The handieapper had let the beast
down to 7st. 71b. to give him a last chance, but he ran
even worse than usual, and was pulled up. The crowd
gave Emir a parting jeer as he cantered past the winning
post, and that was the end of him as a racer. Two years
ago he was pftt to the stud. Then he was put into train-
ing again, with the result that a number of punters threw
their half sovs. away on his chances until the animal
had finished last in about six races in succession,
after which he continued to finish last without being
backed at all. Emir, or rather the infatuation of
Emir’s owner, was a standing joke of late—so much of a
joke that the former glories of the gee-gee were quite for-
gotten. At sundry times in divers places Emilf did great
things. As a two-vear-old he beat the speedy Chantress
at weight for age. As a three-year-old he beat Lord
Cardigan three times, and one time was in a champion
race where he galloped splendidly. As a four-year-old he
carried 9st. 41b. into third place for the Caulfield Cup,
giving 251 b. to the runner-up, Acrasia, who afterwards
won the Melbourne Cup. And as a five-y'ear-old he beat
Gladsome at w.f.a. At the present time he couldn’t beat
a donkey, unless the ass stopped to kick. In which case
Emir probably would also stop to kick.
Winners of 17 out of 25 events at recent V.R.C.
meeting first drew milk in N.S.W., and among them they
gathered the richest things—Derby and Cup and Mari-
byrnong Plate. Sydney riders had 14 winning mounts,
and 10 first and several second and third prizes fell to
nags from the same city. Grafton, with six wins, topped
all sires represented. W. H. Smith rode his first winner
on the third day, and gathered three races. The next
best performer won two. The biggest haul of spoil went
to Lord Nolan’s owner, Mr. J. Mayo ; he bagged £5027
(Melbourne Cup) and £2OO (third in Derby). Miss Robert-
son (“M. Gordon”), Alawa’s owner, was next in the list,
claiming £1865 (Derby) and £402 (C. B. Fisher Plate).
Theatrical manager Mr. J. C. Williamson has
had bad luck. His Blue Book fell at Randwick a year
ago and had to he long laid up. After the nag won a
couple of races early this season, J.C.W. heaped consider-
able coin on him for the Epsom, Metrop. and Melbourne
Cup, and form indicated excellent prospects. Blue Book
was just beaten in the Epsom, and suffered so badly in
the Metrop., when Kyeadgerie and Plunder fell, that he
had to be scratched for everything else. At Randwick,
the other morning, Mr. Williamson’s promising colt
Zythum was galloped upon, and a badly-dislocated fore-
fetlock renders him useless for racing purposes. Rosehill
meeting, last Saturday and Monday, saw similarly owned
Malteur (well .backed on each occasion) fill two second
places and one third. Once, when 10 to 1 was laid on
him, he was only beaten at the finish, and then merely
through the winner (Exsul) getting an opportune open-
ing on the rails in the' last few strides.

The skill of the punter in missing the winner
amounts to genius. Punters fell over each other
endeavoring to lay 3 to 1 on imported Dowdingstown in
a field of three for the Jumpers’Flat Race at Rosehill,
Saturday, and he finished last. The devil himself couldn’t
have been further out than that.

Died in Melbourne, that once prominent book-

Roughly, there was £84,000 worth of motor
car in the members’ motor reserve at Flemington on
Cup Day. The number was 168, of which only 23 were
inter-State. Then there was another array in the outer
carriage reserve, and an automobile expert figures out that
there was altogether over £lOO,OOO worth of smell-makers
at Flemington on that day. A few years ago even a mem-
ber’s “ smelling billy” was not admitted to the grounds.

Citizen Wren’s stewards had quite a field day at
Richmond (Vic.) pony races the day before the Cup.
They started .by holding .inquiries into the running of
Ados and Grace, and arrived at verdicts of “not proven.”
Then the owner of Andy, considering that his prad’s win
was incompatible with the animal’s recent performances,
asked them to lay their intellects on to the matter, which
they did, and once 'more reached the “ not proven ” de-
cision. After that they considered the adjourned charge
against a moke called E.A., and settled the case by can-
celling the jock’s license for incapacity. Next they fined
a jockey £5 for cheeking the starter, but kindly allowed
him to ride in and win the next race before ante-ing up.
Then they wandered about and handed out penalties vary-
ing from £1 to £2 to nine different persons for being late
at the start, or cheeking a steward, or some other caper.
Doubtless Wren’s stewards considered they were setting
an example to the V.R.O. But what a lot of irregularity
there must be about pony courses, to call for so many
penalties 'all at once 1
If the racehorses said to be owned by Jack
Wren are really his property, the friends and turf fol-
lowers of that notorious citizen must be losing faith in
his luck. The gees associated with his name seem
always to get rated above their merits. Their public
form proves to have been deceptive when they are asked
to travel an extra bit ot distance, or their wonderful
private trials are falsified, by results when the big money
goes on them. But the rumor as to Wren having backed
a certain animal for an important handicap is sometimes
the only reason for the allegation that he owns it.

The title of fastest cyclist in the world seems to
have devolved on Australian rider A. J. Clarke. Both
Frank Kramer and Henri Mayer have lowered their colors
to him repeatedly in both scratch and match events. His
most recent success was in a triangular contest at Madi-
son Square Garden, New York. The event was decided
over three distances, and the only starters were Clarke,
Kramer and Mayer. In the half-mile Clarke beat Kramer
by a length, with Mayer lengths behind. In the one
mile Kramer got home with 2ft. to spare from Clarke,
with Mayer again third. In the final, which was also over
a mile, Kramer got the inside running, making a terrific
jump from the hell. Clarke kept alongside till they
turned into the straight, and then dashed past Kramer
and won by a length and a half. America is the land
where champions are made, not born.

f Cyclist Salvana’s former attempt to lower the
record between Melbourne and Sydney was interfered
with by cold, which was so intense that there was danger
of him being frozen. Last week he made another at-
tempt, and reached Albury (198 miles) in 17J hours, but
the heat was awful, and to avoid apoplexy Salvana
boarded the train and pondered on the advantages of
civilisation.

Indications at time of writing are that Victoria
is in for a shocking walloping at the hands of South Aus-
tralia’s cricketers. Victoria’s first effort ended in 219 for
the innings, and then South Australia got going, and
heaped up 496. Clem Hill made 141. Victoria
has to thank its three colts, Carroll, Vernon, and
McKenzie, who made 80, 57, and 21 respectively, for sav-
ing it from the disgrace of being dismissed for less than a
century. But, presumably, these .voting men will get
their reward when the Victorian section of the next Aus-
tralian XI. is being picked.
* * * *
The N.S.W. trial cricket match was a field day
for the colts. Reid, of Burwood, scored 91, making the
bowling of the alleged first flighters look very groggy.
Kelleway and Gorry couldn’t be shifted, and the second
team closed its innings for 306 with nine wickets down,
so that the First crowd might have a chance to bat. At
one time bowler Emery had three wickets for 24 runs,
but he kept going too long, and in the end his figures fell
to four for 156. The old hands like not these fine displays
by the children.
As a bowler, M. A. Noble is, apparently, a has-
been. In three Sydney grade cricket matches he failed
to secure a wicket, and had 88 runs knocked off his bowl-
ing. In the N.S.W. First XI. v. N.S.W. Second XI. trial-
match, his solitary wicket cost 70 runs. On the other
hand, with the bat, Noble, like Julius Caesar, is mighty
still. Likewise, Sydney Gregory. Mary Ann drove and
smashed 112 to his credit before Kelleway got him, and
Sydney had just completed his century when Foster got
him off a difficult one, also from Kelleway. At the close
of the day, the First XI. had made 362 for the loss of
eight wickets. The Second XI. had acted with unprofit-
able generosity.
N.S.W. schoolboy E. P. Barbour is in good
form with bat and ball. Already this season Barbour
has scored heavily, and on Saturday against University
(a Sydney first-grade team) he made 138 runs out of a
total of 264, and gathered in seven wickets for 129 runs.
The N.S.W. selection committee should give this young
man an opportunity to show his grit in better company.
* * * *
Judging by the finish of the third round of Mel-
bourne pennant cricket, the clubs have got the tired feel-
ing, and the century is a bird of great rarity. Yet there
is no increase of brilliancy on the part of the ball. Cer-
tainly Hazlitt took seven for 31, but as it was at the
expense of St. Kilda the glory is discounted much.
Melbourne C. 0. simply crushed St. Kilda by 145 on the
first innings. Richmond and Northcote occupied the
position of the cat and the mouse; Richmond,
closing with 242 for nine wickets, dismissed
Northcote for 44 and 45 at the first and
second times of asking, thus winning by an
innings and 153 runs. The feature of the debacle was
Lampard, Richmond’s new wicket-keeper, who stumped
seven and caught one for the afternoon ; while Kelly, the
Richmond trundler, took 11 for 29. East chastised the
Skinnerites of South Melbourne by 146 on the first
innings, and P’ran went down to Essendon by 72 on the
first innings. Fitzro.v’s trouble with University resulted
in the defeat of the latter by 54 on the first innings.
North Melbourne also scored a first-innings victory over
Collingwood by 60 runs. Altogether it was a dreary ex-
hibition.

The smashing of swimming records has started
early in Sydney this season. In the East Sydney Swim-
ming Club’s 100yds. handicap, at the new municipal baths
in the Domain,'Cecil Healy was on scratch in the third
heat. The world’s record for the distance was that of
C. M. Daniels (55sec. and two-fifths of a second), made at
Manchester, England, on September 7, 1907. Cecil
Healy streaked over the distance in 55sec., and repeated
the performance in the final, which he also won.

Melbourne’s recent Henley-on-the-Yarra re-
gatta, so gloriously successful from the Toorakian and
Paris Frockian point of view, was profoundly unsatisfac-
tory to the chaps who provided the incidental boat-racing.
The Henley committee, though given the “right” (the
legality whereof is doubtful) to charge the public as much
as 2s. 6d. for admission to a reserved tract of the public
river bank, are seemingly unable to keep a clear course
for the regatta. Melbourne Harbor Trust controls the
river as far as Queen’s Bridge only. The Metropolitan
Board of Works has no authority over anything that hap-
pens on the face of the water, though the water itself is
nominally the Board’s property. Neither has Melbourne
City Council any power in the matter. The Lands De-
partment’s authority is confined to the river banks. Con-
sequently, pleasure-tubs and launches infest the regatta
course on “ Henley ” day, and cause obstruction and dam-
age to the racing boats. The racing gets no serious atten-
tion from the management of the show, or from the people
who provide the bulk of the gate money. In fact
a sure way of not seeing the regatta is to
pay 2s. 6d. for admission to the tony reserve,
where the view of the river is obstructed by a long array
of bedizened house-boats. It is as though J. C. William-
son, after drawing a crowded paying audience to a theatre,
were discovered to have put a marquee along the full
length of the orchestra for the private accommodation of
the management and friends. The people who don’t pay
to see the regatta get an interrupted outlook from the
opposite bank. From them the crews get a display of intel-
ligent interest in the racing, whilst from the house-boat
side of the stream they get the motor launchers and other
obnoxious-craft persons who fool up and down the aquatic
track without regard for anything but the fashionable
attention they are exciting at the moment, and will pre-
sently receive in the society columns of the press. If the
bona-fide rowing men and their club supporters want to
get full satisfaction for the trouble and expense inci-
dental to a “ Henley” meeting, they should organise next
year a sturdy force of amateur river-police, and send
them to patrol the river armed with pea-shooters and
Hour-bags. Then, if Algie de Grazier and Gwendoline
Sheeprun made objects of themselves in a gilt-edged tub
in the middle of the course, the patrol could shoot peas
at Gwenny’s preposterous millinery and disconcert Algie
with a flour-bag on the boko.

Johnson is now training at the Joseph Banks
Hotel (Botany, N.S.W.) in the face of admiring crowds,
which include a fair sprinkling of females. There is a
touch of Louis XIV. about Johnson, and as far as possible
he lives in the glare of publicity. Therefore a platform
is being erected in front of the grandstand that all who
wish to see the mighty bruiser going through his Sandow
and other exercises may do so in comfort. Burns, on the
other hand, is at Medlow, where he has a cottage to him-
self, and he scours the rugged country on foot all day.
Twin Jack Sullivan left Vancouver for Australia on Friday
last, and on arrival will proceed straight to Medlow
to put the finishing touches on the preparation of the
champion. But what a waste of time and energy it all is .
Looked at calmly and sensibly, could there be anything
more foolish than to bring these two men all the way
from Britain, and to give them £6OOO to bash and batter
one another for about an hour. And what sort of a
country is it that pays its visiting pugs £6OOO for three
months’ training and one hour’s battling, and doles out a
miserable £2lOO to its Prime Minister and Minister for
External Affairs, for a whole j r ear’s steady graft? Go into
the ring, young man, go into the ring.
AVERTED VIOLENCE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The contest lasted 15 rounds, and through that busy
period Williams treated O’Keefe’s head as a punching ball.
Meanwhile the Irishman was hammering away the
best he could at Williams’ ribs He clung to O’Keefe
like a clam, used his elbow, and once “turned in ” for a
most decided cross buttock For a moment or two it
looked as though the two men were disposed to do one
another an injury. The police, however, prevented any-
thing of this kind by stopping the contest.— Melb. Age
report of the Williams-O’Keefe hashing match.
Stripped to the buff they circled round,
And jagged and swung and crossed ;
To upper-cut and smash and pound
No chances either lost ;
Till folks opined, in some alarm,
That they might do each other harm.
Fiercely they swung the left and right,
With punch and bash and clout:
Each grimly hopeful that he might
Secure the glad knock-out.
And, as they watched the “ claret ” spurt,
The crowed feared someone might be hurt.
The ribs of one were bruised and sore,
His chin was badly gashed ;
The other’s face was streaked w'ith gore ;
And yet they biffed and bashed.
And someone said, “ If this goes on
There’ll be an injury anon.”
Harder and swifter rained the blows,
And fiercer grew the fray ;
At chest and chin and.eye and nose
Each boxer biffed away ;
Till cried the audience in fright,
“If they’re not stopped they’ll start to fight! ”
But on they battled, bruised and dazed,
Scarce able now to stand ;
Until the Law stepped in and raised
A stern, restraining hand.
Ah ! ’’ sighed the crowd, freed from suspense,
“ It might have led to violence.”

DEN.
TO OVERCOME INDIGESTION.
In the first place, remove the cause, which is
mainly the use of improper food, eating too fast,
excessive use of alcoholic liquors or tobacco, and
sometimes excessive work or study. Get the sys-
tem down to its normal condition, clear out the
bowels, assist digestion by Dr. Morse’s Indian
Root Pills, and the rest is simply a matter of diet.
“Eighteen months ago I was subject to violent
attacks of indigestion,” writes Mrs. Honor
Clarkson, Uralla, N.S.W. “I could not bear the
pressure of my clothes on the body, and I would
feel as if I was suffocating. I also suffered from
defective vision and severe headaches. My sister
advised me to try Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills
and pressed me to take three which she gave me.
I took them and noticed a feeling of great relief.
I thereupon purchased a bottle, and with con-
tinued treatment I was quite cured. I always
keep them by me, and my sons generally carry a
bottle in their pockets. Whenever I find any
symptoms of indigestion returning I take one or two
and they put me right again almost immediately.”
Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills are not simply a
purgative which forces the food out of the body,
depriving the stomach of its nourishment and thus
starving the system ; they contain the essential
properties that are temporarily lacking in the
stomach through weakness, and complete diges-
tion and assimilation, and so restore the functions
of the digestive organs by obtaining the maximum
of nutriment from the food, which sustains the
body and assures good health.

The S. Australian Assembly took five
minutes off and had a game the other afternoon.
By some accident all three Ministers were absent
from the chamber at the same time, and six
playful Labor members took possession of the
Treasury bench. They called Opposition-leader
Butler over and asked him what he was willing to
give for a seat. Then they formally offered the
vacant Agent-Generalship to their own leader,
miner Jack Verran, and were proceeding to por-
tion out other posts now or soon to be available
when Premier Price came hurrying in and rang
down the curtain.
From the West Australian (14/10’08) :
TP anyone wishes to get cured of Tuberculosis, or
any other Diseases of Cattle, or any other animal,
I will guarantee to cure within three days or three
weeks; in very bad cases within three months. If
they wish for it they should call me to a public meet-
ing, any place in Perth on any day at 3or 4 p.m. If
anyone does not care for it, I don’t care either,
because I have not any cattle of my own or any other
animals to die out by any diseases.

Wales, one
takes an unfair advantage of a
State that hasn’t had the advantages of
the other two. Having no taining booms to
give it an impetus at the start, and commencing
likewise with a muddled colonisation scheme, its
development was slow and warped. It dragged,
and, for a number of years, its progress was as
casual as that of a lame ’bus-horse. Edward Gib-
bon Wakefield, who may be remembered as a
brilliant theorist, who made colonisation his life-
passion, was certainly responsible for its begin-
nings. That the beginnings were to a certain
extent bungled was scarcely due to Wakefield.
He urged the British Government to colonise
according to his pet system—which may be briefly
described as the sale of land instead of pro-
miscuous free grants to aspiring colonists—and,
no doubt to his huge satisfaction, the first ship-
load of immigrants arrived in 1836. But things
failed to move with any considerable speed.
Whatever the colonists were, they were, in the
bulk, not of the stocky pioneer type that lays the
foundations of young and vigorous nations. Soft
and pulpy folk, not inclined for hardship or tilling
the soil that was so rich and promising, many of
them gambled in town lots —an ancient passion
with all peoples—with the result that a smart
British officer, Captain Grey, had to come out and
reorganise affairs on sound lines. Retrenchment,
able, administration, and the discovery of copper
at Kapunda in 1843, and at Burra Burra in 1845,
stopped the stagnation and put the State on
the up grade. It has been making good pro-
gress ever since, mostly in agriculture and
viticulture, though its mining development
is not to be sneezed at.
Though, by an agreement with
the British Government, the
colony, as it then was, was
to receive a Constitution as
soon as it reached a popula-
tion of 50,000 —which it did
in 1851—it was not until
185 G that it was granted
the boon of responsible
government; so that it has been governing it-
self for a little over 40 years, and since 1901, the
year of Federation, with a reduced number of mem-
bers. Its present Houses of Parliament up in North
Terrace, Adelaide, where just now the only Labor
Government in Australasia looks after its destinies,
are probably the first edifices that attract the eye
after leaving the railway station, to which the
visitor must inevitably come from Largs Bay,
where he has, of course, arrived from the East by
one of the steamers of the Five Companies. Built
of Kapunda marble, the new building devoted to
the Assembly, and the older one to the Council,
the Houses of Parliament are eye-arresting, though
quietly imposing, rather than ornate and extrava-
gant. Indeed, in Adelaide, there are many build-
ings that would satisfy the most fastidious, and
as everyone knows, the city itself is as charming
as may be. Prettily-situated; with the blue
slopes of Mt. Lofty Range but a few miles
distant ; possessing a delightful climate, which,
even in the hottest months, is easily sup-
portable ; and with plenty of amusements,
Adelaide is an excellent place for a lengthy
adjournment of a fortnight at least. The city is
laid out with such regularity that even a crooked
thoroughfare would make a delightful break in
the monotony. Still, the propriety, the mathe-
matical placing of the five squares, the undevia-
ting correctness of the shade trees planted in the
streets, the frequency of churches—testifying
perhaps, to rigid Christian propaganda, all give
the city an air of something admirable, but not
quite earthly. Not to say that Adelaide is
heavenly in an impossible sense, but that it is
possible in a heavenly sense. Practically entirely
surrounded by acres and acres of park lands, pro-
viding, under skilled attention, resorts that cannot
fail to be popular from sunrise to sun-
set, as they are from sunset to sunrise,
it is the most fortunate of cities. Its buildings’
moreover, are not perceptibly inferior to those°in
either Sydney or Melbourne. Those that are
vaguely called public buildings have a right to
the consideration of the intelligent layman and
professional architect. The Town Hall, with its
high tower; the G.P.0., in white freestone, and
with a higher tower; the town residence of the
State Governor (he has a country one at Marble
Hill); the School of Mines and Industries; the
Art Gallery; the Anglican and Roman Catholic
cathedrals, and so forth—are all of potential
value in the city’s appearance. Statues there
are too, scattered 'about with an enthusiam
that it is quite possible to extol. Certainly
their profusion rather than their individual
excellence will be readily admitted by that
occasional stranger who sniffs at earnest art,
doubtful sanitation and hygiene, and middle-
class drawing-rooms in the same, all-embracing
sniff. 'V et Adelaide need not worry. The ordinary
visitor isn’t hypercritical. He, for instance, could
not find anything positively offensive in, say, the
proximity of Hercules to Queen Victoria—the
classic to the mundane —in Vietoria-square ; or
would he be tortured by the fact that Scotland’s
Ploughman Poet adorns the entrance to Govern-
ment House within a short distance of a plump, if
not matronly, Goddess of Love. To suggest that
one each pair is out of place is monstrous
and untenable—and anyhow it doesn’t matter !
Also Adelaide possesses an extraordinary good Art
Gallery, the pictures comprising, besides works of
local men, who are commendably encouraged, those
of such English painters as Watts, and of such
eminent Frenchmen as Bouguereau. Probably,
however, the more practical visitor will demand
something gayer and more generally interesting.
He will get it in the Zoo, said to be the best in
Australia, haying 1400 specimens of animals,
birds and reptiles, and charging—except on Satur-
days, when it is free—6d. per head.
To be sure, Adelaide comprises, or should com-
prise, only part of the visit. Within easy reach
of it there is a number of places that are
appealing enough to repay the expenditure
of a tram or train fare. There are, for
instance, the seaside resorts of Henley Beach,
Brighton, and Glenelg, the last of considerable
historical interest—and such pleasant places as
Burnside, Mitcham, beloved of picnickers, and
Norton’s Summit, reached by a winding road
among the hills, and one of the most picturesque
spots around Adelaide. But, of all, an excursion
into the wine districts should not be omitted
even if there is no time for anything else. By
taking train to Gawler, which is a quaint little
town about 25 miles out, and thence on through
Tanunda, Angaston, and Schlunke’s Creek, one
passes through acres and acres of fertile vine
lands. It is a most surprising trip, while the in-
habitants, nearly all Germans,
and still speaking Ger-
man after years of
settlement in the
State, are most hos-
pitable. To see South

itself alone worth

The Oil Industry in N.S.W. To-day.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
Every oil-producing country in the world is now
seized of the necessity of protecting its petroleum
industry from the rapacity of the Standard Oil
Trust, and in some countries where petroleum is
not present, the tariff has been designed in such a
way as to force the oil kings to refine their petro-
leum locally. But when the Australian Parlia-
liament was dealing with the question, this is how
it treated our petroleum industry
Kerosene, free.
Crude petroleum, free.
Wax (a petrol by-product), dentist or modelling, free.
Naphtha, benzine, benzoline, and gasoline (all oil pro-
ducts), id. per gallon. .. _
Vaclite and cheese coating, consisting of paraffin wax,
Jd.perlb. *
Then, curiously enough, having admitted all the
main items of the industry free or under a tariff
The Coke Ovens.
that had absolutely no protective incidence, it
decided to foster the making of some of the sub-
sidiary by-products which could be done only if
the main industry was encouraged. So :
Candles (made of paraffin wax), Id. per lb.
Other mineral and spirit oils, 6d. pe,r gallon.
Lubricating, mineral pils, 3d. per gallon.
Paraffin wax, 4s. Bd. per cwt.
Gasoline for printing machines, if imported separately,
15 per cent.
Which was equivalent to letting in butter free
but protecting the skim milk.
* * * *
The making of kerosene in N.S.W. dates
back to February, 1865, when the first bottle was
distilled from oil shale obtained near Mount
Kembla. In consequence James Graham erected
works there, and in December of that year pro-
duced and sold the first kerosene made in Aus-
tralia, at ss. 6d. per gallon. But within a year,
owing to the termination of the Civil War in the
U.S.A., the price dropped to Is. 6d. per gallon.
Still the works were carried on for 10 years, and
produced about 1500 gallons of pure oil weekly.
Then came the discovery of oil shale at Hartley
Yale, and in November, 1866, the Hartley Kero-
sene Oil and Paraffin Co. Ltd. commenced opera-
tions ; but confined itself to extracting the shale
and selling it in its raw state to gas companies in
Sydney and oversea. It had struck the richest
shale known in the history of the world, shale
which yielded 160 gallons of oil to the ton, besides
paraffin wax, ammonia and other things. Two
years later the Western Kerosene Oil Co. Ltd.
came into existence, and erected a refining plant
in Botany-road, Sydney. The plant consisted of
15 retorts capable of turning out scwt. of oil every
12 or 15 hours. Other companies erected retorts
and opened up mines, and by 1871 six thousand
gallons of pure oil were produced weekly by the
various refineries of N.S.W.
Unfortunately the Government Statistician
does not seem to have regarded the oil-
making industry as of any importance, and
kept a record only of ', the quantity of shale
mined. The writer has endeavored to trace
the rise and fall of the oil industry
from private sources, but the compilation of a
comprehensive and consecutive account would
take more time than is at his disposal. Many
shale mines were opened, many retorts erected,
and hundreds of thousands of pounds sunk in the
endeavor to establish the industry in a small way.
But oil refining is a business that cannot be carried
out in a small way ; it requires a large, up-to-date
refinery surrounded by a number of crude oil
works, and as all our shale deposits are in rugged
country the difficulty of transport made a great
industry for the time being impossible. So the
mines were abandoned, the plants scrapped, and
the industry generally given up. The Blue Moun-
tains are dotted over with the remains of the
failures. One after another they all went
the same road till only the New South Wales
Shale and Oil 00. remained, with a refinery at
Hartley Yale, and crude oil works at Torbane, on
the Mudgee line. This plucky company had ex-
plored great areas of country, and discovered the
enormous richness of the Wolgan and Capertee
Yalleys, and in the latter had grassed enormous
quantities of shale. Owing to the high price of
transport only the richest shale, that which con-
tained from 120 to 160 gallons of oil to the ton,
would pay for the cost of removal, and it was
hauled out and shipped to Germany and England.
Then the Commonwealth Oil Corporation, see-
ing that the trend was towards Protection, and
believing that the Australian Government would
foster the industry, came along and tackled the
subject with larger resources than any of the other
pioneers who had gone before. It bought the
Hartley Vale Works, the Torbane Oil Retorts,
and acquired large interests in the phenomenally
rich Wolgan Valley, which, however, was quite
inaccessible. When the Australian Parliament
made oil free the making of refined kerosene
ceased, and even the great and powerful C.O.C.
confined itself to the making of candles, coke, and
lubricating oils and the export of coke. So, prac-
tically, all that is left of the Australian Oil
industry is confined to Hartley Vale and Torbane.
The writer recently packed a gripsack and went
for a scamper through the -N.S.W. Oil Districts.
And this is what he saw.
» ■* * *
At Hartley Vale, the old N.S.W. Shale and
Oil Co.’s refinery is still being utilised to make
candles and lubricating oils. The crude oil,
mostly from Torbane, is seen in large tanks, black,
thick and - evil-smelling. , As it passes through
each refining process it takes on a lighter hue, till
it reaches a pale yellow. Carried to the farthest
point it would have been colorless, like water, but
with kerosene on the free list it does not pay to
carry ifrto that point. The wax is extracted, and
then passes through various refining processes till
it emerges white as snow. Then it is again
melted and poured into moulds, through which
long strings of white cotton have been threaded.
After a few minutes the
operator presses a lever, and
a long 1 array of beautiful,
dazzlingly white candles rises
into view. The company
turns out these alabaster-
like candles for domestic
use, and also another speci-
ally hardened kind for the
use of miners. Hartley Vale
produced the richest shale
in the history of the world,
but the deposits have been
worked out, and, sad to say,
most of the product has gone
to Britain and Germany.
Catching the train at
Hartley Yale station, the
next stage was th Newnes
Junction, where the Com-
monwealth Oil Corporation’s private rail
branches off into the wonderful and wildly beauti-
ful Wolgan Valley, 34 miles away.
As the company has not yet got its passenger
ears in commission, the journey over the company’s
line was made in a motor car fitted with flanged
wheels. This line traverses the most rugged and
inaccessible portions of the Blue Mountains, and
runs through scenery so wildly beautiful and so
splendidly majestic that a blast world-trotter who
was on board, and was fresh from the glories of
Alpine splendors, raved over it. The construc-
tion of the line presented enormous engineering
difficulties, but they were overcome. The car ran
along the sinuous steel road that wound along the
ridges down the spurs over hideous grades, which
averaged one in 25 for the whole journey, and we
traversed a zigzag which makes the great wonder
on the State line blush with envy. And such
curves—the . great majority of them were five-
chain ones, which is an appalling thing from a
railway standpoint. For miles we ran through a
howling desolation that would support about one
bear to 10 acres, and then plunged into a wilder-
ness of sandstone peaks. The stone is inter- ;
lineated with bands of iron ore, and, the soft stone
having weathered away, the iron ridges were left
standing out, and the result is that these
peaks look like Chinese pagodas. It was an
eerie sight, and reminded one of Marco Polo s
description of his journey through the deserted
cities of the Flowery Land. Down, down, down
we rushed, and passed between two great, white
sandstone masses which are known as the Gates
of the Gorge. The line clung to the edge of
horrible precipices, and overhead hung gigantic
masses of rocks, the sight of which froze the
marrow and gave one the stomach-ache.
But the culmination of grandeur and awesome-
ness was met when we arrived at the far end of
No. 2 tunnel. Here the rocks rise gigantically on.
In the heart of the Blue Mountains.
either side, and only a strip of the sky is to be
seen, while the rails disappear into a dark cavity
underneath a massive rock face about 1500 ft. high.
The picture gives but a faint idea of the majestic
vastness of this place.
* * * *
The Wolgan Valley is a veritable storehouse of
wealth. Shale tunnels, coal mines, coke works,
brick works were all in close proximity. And
gigantic excavations marked the site of the great
refinery that is to be. A swarm of workmen were
toiling on the first beginnings of the great bench
of 64 retorts, each of which when erected will
have.cost. £lOOO. Another swarm were building
the brick framework of the great condensers, and
200 ft. below a small army of men were tearing out
the glistening black coal for
the making of coke. Away
in another corner men were
making bricks with the
latest machine, which turns
out 20,000 per day. And all
around in drives and tunnels
there were more men tearing
out the shale, loading it on
little trucks, which heaped
it up at the tunnel mouth,
where the sorter threw
aside all that contained 120
gallons to the ton or more.
This man is a skilled ob-
server, and tellsthe richness
by feeling the weight. The
best shale is loaded up
on to trucks and the
great Shay geared locomotives of the com-
pany haul it up that tremendous line to
Newnes Junction, whence it goes to Sydney, to be
shipped to Germany and Britain. The shale
drives are dry, well-ventilated, and easy to work
in. In many places the miners use bark shields,
as the shale, immediately it is fractured by the
pick, shoots out with force, owing to the pressure
of the wall. There are unlimited quantities of it,
and mostly all of it of phenomenal richness.
Between Wolgan and Capertee valleys rise
seven miles of gigantic mountain, over which we
passed on horseback along 19 miles of bridle paths
that were hideous to look at. The horses are
accustomed to the journey, and occasionally they
sit down to it, and before the passenger can make
up his mind how to get off,, he.is at the bottom of
the declivity, and the trusty neddy is carefully
picking his way along the edge of a precipice any-
thing from one to 1200 ft. deep.
In Capertee Valley the first sight is the spectacle
of 50,000 tons of shale lying at grass. This is the
accumulation of the men who went before. All
that had over 120 gallons of oil in it has been
picked out and sent to Europe. Under that figure
The Beginning of a Bench of Retorts.
it remains, because the cost of transport in that
awful country has made its removal unprofitable.
Roughly, there are at the lowest estimate four
million gallons of oil lying perishing in the Caper-
tee Valley. The C.O.C. is piercing the mountain
from both the Wolgan and Capertee sides, and
the two drives will meet in the heart of it, when
it will be decided whether that accumulated shale
and all that is taken out will be sent through the
tunnel or over the mountain bv a “flying fox.”
And so far from both sides the great tunnel is
following the seam of shale.
» * * *
But the pitiful part of it is that, unless some-
thing is done in the way of either a duty on im-
ported kerosene and paraffin or a bonus on crude
oil, Australia will get very little of the great
treasure that is being torn out. The pick of the
shale will go to Germany and Britain, the rest
will be turned into cheap lubricating oils, and the
wax, which is useful for a thousand and one
things, will be turned into candles alone.
For it must not be thought for one moment that
fuel and illuminating agents are the only things
made out of petroleum. Just consider this little
list: —
Petroleum is used for the making of air gas, oil
gas, carburetted water gas, and the enrichment of
coal gas.
The residuum makes excellent fuel for steam-
ships, locomotives, and stationary engines and
boilers.
Petroleum spirit is used for fuel in internal
combustion engines, such as drive motor cars and
boats.
Petroleum oil as a lubricant has driven all fixed
oils clean out of the market, and the more viscous
descriptions are specially suitable for ore concen-
tration by the Elmore process.
Paraffin is utilised to make woollens stronger
and waterproof. Also, for glazing frescoes, paper
and linen, and the making of many kinds of dyes.
It replaces soap in laundry work, and forms a
good preservative for wood or metal, flowers, fruit,
meat, eggs, and is a perfect insulator for electric
purposes.
Treated by various processes, it has varying
actions on other substances, and becomes in turn
an insecticide, a wool wash, 15 different skin and
toilet requisites, several perfumes, the basis of
coloring matter for printing inks, paints of many
colors, lubricating paste for cutting and boring
machines, qoloring and glazing medium for bricks,
tiles, and other things. .In fine leather work it is
used for the polishing and preservation of the
leather. It enters into the processes of dry-clean-
ing, dissolving of rubber, and the making of lino-
The Poppet Heads.
leum, dampfelt, waterproof cement, wood pre-
servatives, and other things.
Vaseline, which is a petrol product, is exten-
sively used for pharmaceutical purposes, and as a
vehicle for the application of various medicinal
agents when local action is required instead of
absorption. It is also extensively used as a basis
for the majority of medicinal ointments, and has
improved upon animal fats by reason of its non-
liability to go rancid.
Rhigoline, the volatile product of petroleum, is
the most valuable local anaesthetic known to sur-
gical science.
Paraffin wax is used primarily for the making
of beautiful translucent candles, but also enters
into dentistry and other fine crafts for the making
of moulds. It is used in the making of tracing
cloth, the covering of cheeses and glass stoppers,
and in the general practice of chemistry.
There are as many other uses which have not
been mentioned, and which have escaped the
writer’s memory, but these are enough to prove
that the establishment of a great oil industry will
employ an army of people not connected with
illumination in any way.
* * * *
Unless some encouragement is given to the
business all these valuable products will be ex-
tracted from our shale in Germany. The Com-
monwealth Oil Corporation is not nearly so
interested in the creation of this in-
dustry as the people of Australia.
Bonus or no bonus it will go on making
lubricating oils, candles, and turning
the splendid Wolgan Valley coal into
coke, which is so excellent in quality
and freedom from sulphur and ash that
Rithgow Iron Works, with their own
coal seam and ovens, prefer to buy
I their coke from the works in Wolgan
1 Valley. The Corporation will go on
sending its richest shale away to Ger-
many and making the rest into the
; substances which are protected by
duties.
But if a bonus is granted on crude
oil, scores, if not hundreds, of crude oil
works will spring up all along that
treasure valley, and employ an army of
men. Once the point of refining pure
kerosene is reached, all the other pro-
ducts are side issues. The Corporation
will be compelled to make them to utilise
all its “waste,” although in a shale indus-
try there is no waste. Even the spent shale
that falls out of the retorts is useful, and makes
the finest fire and other bricks known to
science. If the bonus is granted on the refined
oil, it will exist for the benefit of the great refiners
only, and for many years for the benefit of the
Commonwealth Oil Corporation only. Granted
on crude oil, it will give ample openings for the
investment of small lots of capital up to £20,000
or so. .
In fact, the question of granting a bonus to
make up for the deplorable blunder of admitting
petroleum oil free is the question of whether we
shall get the full value out of our wonderfully rich
shale, or merely get the price of it in its raw statg
and re-import the finished article from abroad.
Consider how Germany deals with this matter.
Mineral oils for the purpose of lubrication arestruck
with an import duty of 10 marks per 100 kilograms.
Petroleum, crude or refined and not otherwise
mentioned, six marks per 100 kilograms. But the
Bundesrath is authorised to admit free of duty,
under control, mineral oil intended to be cleaned,
refined, or distilled in the national factories, so
that the produce obtained therefrom, such as
benzine, ligroin and petroleum ether, remain free
of duty on condition that they cannot be employed
for lighting or lubrication. Paraffin pays
a duty of 10 marks per 100 kilograms (tare),
A Cliff Above—a Precipice Below!
candles are blocked with 18 marks per 100 kilo-
grams (tare), and refined mineral wax pays 10
marks per 100 kilograms (tare). But shale, cannel
coal, anthracite, and lignites all go in free, so the
German, who has considerable oil deposits of his
own, finds it worth while to import shale all the
way from Australia to supplement his supply.
The same policy carried out in Australia would
not only make work for an army of people locally,
but also enable Australia to enter the lists as an
oil-exporting country, and fight the (standard Oil
Trust off its own bat, in the foreign markets.

Eczema Spread All Over His Body—
Not a Minute’s Comfort in Sixteen
Months—Constantly Experi-
mented With Remedies, but Even
the Doctor’s Treatment Failed —
Writer Pronounces the
CUTICURA REMEDIES
OF MARVELOUS POWER
"A gentleman, who is a near relative
of mine, has suffered terribly with ec-
zema. The trouble started in the form
of little white pimples on the hands.
These pimples would burst and become
sore. The irritation was very great at
all times, and sometimes almost un-
bearable. He tried various remedies
from the first, but nothing seemed to
do him the least good. Still, he kept
persevering with all the things heard
or read of. As his condition gradually
became worse under these trials, he de-
cided to go to a doctor. The doctor
put him under a treatment, and he per-
sisted with it for some time without
the least sign of a permanent cure. He
was almost despairing. No sooner had
one sore healed than others came.
Prom being only on the hands, the dis-
ease spread until his whole body was
affected. His wrists, elbows, and back
were worst, and were really most dis-
tressing. The pain he suffered is be-
yond words. His work necessitates plac-
ing his hands in water a great deal, and
the water seemed to aggravate the
trouble. After the doctor’s treatment
failed, my relative again resorted to
other remedies, with the same disheart-
ening result, and in this way sixteen
months dragged by. During this time
I can truthfully say that he did not
have a minute’s comfort. His case
having become so serious, you can im-
agine how thankful he was when he
found that he had the right remedy in
Cuticura. Had he started with Cuticura
Kennedies at first he would have saved
untold trouble and expense. He fol-
lowed the directions carefully and the
improvement was most marked from
day to day. He derived great comfort
from the very first, and I should say that
within six months the disease was per-
fectly eradicated, and his skin is as clear
as it ever was. I pronounce Cuticura
Kemedies to be of simply marvelous
power. Mrs. E. Spalding, 142 a, Den-
nett Rd., W. Croydon, nr. London,

abolishing the terrors of sea trips.
Most of the sickness suffered by people, and principally
ladies, during- sea trips arises from the smell of bilge
water or oil or other unpleasant odors found on even the
best kept steamers. And it is this fear of sea-sickness
that loses our coasting steamers thousands of passengers
every year. A good preventive of this main cause of
sea-sickness is now to be found in the new, cheap and
simple, self-contained electrical appliance for the purpose
of distributing perfumes throughout steamers’ saloons,
cabins, etc. It is a wonderful appliance, about the size of
a small mantelpiece clock, and is instantly put in motion
by touching a little handle. It may be seen at Washing-
ton H. Soul’s (Pattinson and Co.), Civil Service Co-op.,
David Jones and Co., Ltd., Farmer and Co., Ltd.,
and Anthony Horderns. It should soon be in use on all
our steamship lines, and in our hospitals, theatres, halls

IN THE HOME.
A vast amount of human misery is
endured by thousands of men and
women who are never really well.
Headache, sickness, nervous depres-
sion, dislike of food, sinking sensa-
tions, with distressing dizziness and
weakness, make life a daily misery
to such sufferers. And the cause is
indigestion—a stomach that starves
the body, because it cannot digest
sufficient food to keep it well, and
leaves the mind weak, irritable,
depressed. To such unhappy ones
Mother Seigel's Syrup brings a mes-
sage of hope, brings the ready help
to health, brings the quiet, strong
sense of confidence which only
health can give—health re-made
and regained, through sound diges-
tion. Take it daily after meals.
Mr. J. Fitzgibbon, i, Hugo Street, Redfern,
N.S.W., writing on March 18th, 1908, says:
“ For years I suffered most severely from
acute indigestion. Nothing did me any good
until I got Mother Seigel’s Syrup. The
first bottle enabled me to eat and digest,
and soon I was quite cured.”

unpleasant conditions, and restore you to physical
harmony, by reducing your weight and restoring

•The immense number of orders for
Frootoids, sent by post direct to the Pro-
prietor, is convincing proof that the
Public appreciate their splendid curing
power over the above-named complaints.
Frootoids are elegant in appearance and
pleasant to take; they are immensely
more valuable than an ordinary aperient;
they remove from the blood, tissues, and
internal organs, waste poisonous matter
that is clogging them and choking the
channels that lead to and from them.
The beneficial effects of Frootoids are
evident by the disappearance of headache,
a bright, cheery sense of perfect health
taking the place of sluggish, depressed
feelings, by the liver acting properly, and
by the food being properly digested.
Frootoids are the proper aperient medi-
cine to take when any Congestion or
Blood Poison is present, or when Conges-
tion of the Brain or Appoplexy is present
or threatening. They have been tested,
and have been proved to afford quick
relief in such cases when other aperients
have not done any good at all.
Frootoids act splendidly on the liver;
a dose taken at bed-time, once a week, is
highly beneficial.
A constipated habit of body will be
completely cured if the patient will on
each occasion, when suffering, take a dose
of Frootoids, instead of an ordinary
aperient. The patient thus gradually
becomes independent of Aperient Medi-
cines.

The Monstrous Regiment of Bent.
An old Victorian Parliamentary pressman sends
along some biographies and a few prophecies :
b un °h of political by-products which Adolphus
hlnt has got together for his new Ministry reads, to any-
o y intimate with Victorian politics, like a burlesque
intimation, the cast of the final farce with which to
terminate the vaudeville entertainment, of which Bent
star vocalist. It is not too much to say
iat the Ministry is the weakest ever got together in any
Australian State during the past 20 years. Even the
ministerial scrap-heaps that the late Henry Parkes used
to rake together, in order that his own brilliancy might
shine the brighter, were monuments of ability as com-
pared with the latest Bent joke. Davies, Macleod and
Mackey alone were retained from the old Ministry.
ovvinburne saw what vvas coming and got from under
before it was too late. Davies, though unquestionably
the most astute and tricky point-worker in Australian
politics to-day, is of little use in the Legislative Council,
and Bent might almost as well have kept the awful Sachse.
Mackey and Macleod were, with the exception of the
Sachse aforesaid, the weakest members of the old crowd.
Macleod is a well-meaning old fellow, but utterly lacking
in administrative ability or strength. Mackey is a
stout, pompous person, who once posed as the
Democrat, the friend of the people, the pure
and undefiled type of man who was wanted to do the
Wilbur Wright act and raise politics to a Higher Plane.
. , r . P i’ ofcssmg ' almost ev ety shade of political belief, he
at last found an electorate to accept him. By this time
he had become, like all the Vic. Single Taxers, a profound
Conservative, and his first step towards shoving things
on to the Higher Plane was to hustle round the corri-
dors all day long trying to worry Ministers into getting a
tew shillings spent in his electorate. Mackey was the
Department-trotter splendid. He took all world’s records
for all distances, and gain’ed his reward eventually with
the portfolio of Lands in Bent’s Ministry. His overween-
ing conceit immediately made him put his finger
into every trifle in the office, with the result
that, at the end of the first three months of his
control, matters were two months in arrears. By this
time there must he about five rooms full of uninitialled
documents, and Mackey’s successor in the Lands Depart-
ment will wonder what hit him the moment he gets going.
The newcomers are absolutely the riffraff of the
Ministerial benches, in a political sense. Bowser is a
man who looks it. He has never carried any weight in
the House. He is a hesitating and flabby member, and
m private life he is the proprietor of a Wangaratta
There is a dark story about one of his subscribers
who had to be restrained from paying him in tomatoes—
at election time.
Mcßryde is a squatter, who dabbles in politics much as
other squatters dabble in golf. Most of Mcßryde’s
time is occupied by the club or the musical comedy ;
but he looks in at Parliament House now and then,
to see how things are going on, and never man-
ages to ascertain. His speeches are almost as
funny as Bent’s songs. If it is possible to mis-
understand anything Mcßryde misunderstands it.
Downward is a person whom hahituhs of Parliament
know as a harmless bore ; while as for Hunt —well, people
know from the division lists that there is such a man as
Hunt, but nobody outside his own district ever saw or
heard of him otherwise. In fact, there are many people
in Victoria who firmly believe that there is no such per-
son as Hunt, and that Bent really makes use of the
name to father votes recorded by a messenger who hurries
in to divisions with an overcoat over his uniform. Of the
honorary Ministers, Robertson, M.L.A., and Payne
M.L.0., are merely ciphers ; while Boyd, M.L.A., will be
very much annoyed that Bent has not seen fit to advance
him to portfolio office. Asa matter of fact, Boyd is far
and away the superior of any of the new team, barring
only Davies, for Bent himself is to-day in the same state
of collapse as the Zeppelin airship.
In principle, assuming that such a combination possesses
such a thing, the new BENT-ites represent the last lone
little fag-end of the old Tory party, which was wont to
regard George Turner as a dangerous incendiary and
think that Duncan Gillies himself was not quite sound.
Everything points to the new crowd remaining in power
about one calendar month, by which time Jack Murray
will have come to agreement with Swinburne and taken
in Peacock as Chief-Secretary and Mackinnon as Attorney-
General, while Watt and Keast fill the smaller offices and
bring over half-a-dozen more Ministerialists. Then Mur-
ray and Co. will occupy the Government benches with
Prendergast’s Laborites behind, while Adolphus Bent
and the rabble of Anti-Sosh sit in Opposition, making
daily overtures to Prendergast.
Melbourne City Council has resumed its fruitless
discussion of the local dust nuisance, and now the
old, old talk is to be spread over a conference of
municipalities, with the idea, seemingly, that
some inspired councillor from an outlying suburb
will suggest a means of preventing dust-storms.
Only two or three of the central city fathers are
alive to the fact that dust in thoroughfares is sub-
ject to the same conditions as dust in houses. It
stops there until it is swept away. Between a
clean house and a dirty house there is the same
difference as between a properly-scavenged street
and a street in Melbourne. In the one case, dust
is swept into a pan, and in the other it is boosted
into a broad gutter what time that estimable
channel has a flow of w ater in it. Melbourne
has an insufficiency of gutter in some
quarters, an insufficient supply of sweepers
and a scarcity of water for flushing purposes.
Even if the streets were properly swept the dust
couldn’t be persistently flooded away from the
side channels unless the present staff of hose
squirters were largely increased, and the rush of
water were always there when wanted. The
foolishness of calling a conference of fatted
mayors to discuss the origin of dust is charac-
teristic of municipal methods. Corporations
are not necessarily ill-meaning. Foolishness is
their chief drawback. Neither are these respon-
sible citizens so indifferent to their duties as
would appear from their habit of gathering to-
gether on the slightest provocation to partake of
refreshments. They believe in themselves, even
when they give a fiendish contractor the job
of smearing the hot roadway with tar, and filling
the eyes of the passer-by with sand. Their
opinion of themselves is sincerely great.
A CASE recently came before the Gunnedah
(N.S.W.) Land Board which is a good example of
the horrible mess that has been made of the State’s
land policy. In the Gunnedah district, and, indeed,
all over the State, there are many valuable lands
held under conditional purchase lease. The State
has the right to re-appraise these lands and raise the
rent after a certain time. The case immediately
before the Board was that of a man now dead.
Fifteen years ago he leased the land for 4d. an acre,
and now the Department wants to re-appraise it to
his executors at Is. Bd. an acre. But the Land
Board dug up, out of the multitude of Land Acts,
one passed in 1895, which secured to the lessee the
right to purchase his land at £1 per acre, quite
irrespective of its value, when the lease had
run 15 years. Further still, it gave him
the right to purchase on the instalment plan,
paying interest at 2J per cent, per annum on the
unpaid balance. Now anyone can see that per
cent, on £1 per acre works out at 6d. per acre per
year. So, if the lessee elected to purchase the
holding, he would, even if he owed the whole
blessed lot of the purchase-money, only pay 6d.
an acre. Therefore, said the Board, what sort of
Juggins did the State take it for to ask it to say
that a man should pay Is. Bd. for rent when by
law he could retain possession of the land for 6d. ?
Therefore it fixed this particular rent at 6d., and
looked hard at the State’s lawyer. The lawyer
curled up like a stricken worm. He had a whole
list of similar cases, some going up to 2s. and 3s.
an acre, while there are hundreds of others all
over the State. The action of the Land Board in
digging up an idiotic old Act, which the State’s
legal advisers had apparently forgotten, will cost
the State thousands a year. The rest of the cases
were hastily withdrawn, with a view to an appeal
to some higher authority.

ELDER, SMITH & Co., Ltd., Adelaide. bourne ,


“Kodak ” gets up early :—
At 6.30 a.m. I knocked on Smith’s door and told him it
was time to go rowing. He sighed deeply and said in a
six-fathom groan that he would be “up in a minute.’’
I tried to spur him on with the old fiction that the boy
would be waiting at the wharf with the boat. The boy,
of course, never is waiting with the boat. He is the
eldest male descendant of the boatman and he is supposed
to tow our skiff over from the shed on the opposite side
of the bay so that we may not have the trouble of going
for it. There is a business-like understanding on this
point between us and the boatman, and we pay for the
slight service on a liberal scale. The boy—who never
arrives to time—does not seem to be moved by our re-
proaches i as a matter of fact he doesn’t appear
to be even interested. We have bribed him in
moderation to come early; he accepts our
offerings ; stoically and next morning comes later
with the wrong set of paddles. We have come to the
conclusion that he doesn’t want to be a boatman. Any-
how, we got down to the Wharf and looked across the
bay, sleeping in the morning mist, to the boat-house. It
was shut tight, and had the look of a house in a trance.
My friend; who has the valuable knack of being able to
u nistle shrilly, put several of his fingers in bis mouth and
m 'de a sound like the scream of a locust-elephant. He
kept on doing this for about five minutes, and then the
boy wandered out to the boat-landing and waved to us
cheerily. “Comm on !” we yelled, and the youth waved
again languidly and moved towards the shed for the
paddles. We hung over the railing' and started to talk of
things said the night before. (When you get up early
the mind continues on in the groove of the previous
evening.) A gay, friendly voice broke in on our con-
versation with a merry “ Good morning, boys,” and, turn-
ing, we beheld the Dignified Borrower. After a polite but
ineffectual attempt to remind my friend of how they bad
once met at a cricket match, he told us frankly—as one
good fellow to another —the story of a Sunday night spree
and a long walk in the small hours from Manly to Mosman
via the Spit. He appealed to us if it wasn’t allowable
for a bloke to “ hit things up ” now and then, and, when
we assented, he lightly introduced the subject of a
shilling. He assured us whimsically that it was not a
habit of his to borrow money from his friends; he
smiled at us and said that we mustn’t judge him
by his second suit of clothes ; then he stopped and glanced
thoughtfully at the approaching boat. Smith explained
sorrowfully that neither of us had brought any money
with us. He apologised for the omission and admitted
that it was careless of us. The boat drew alongside and
the Borrower looked at it with an expression of amused
scorn. It was a tragic enough situation, but a pale,
earnest young man made it worse. The pale young man
fled down the steps with , half-a-dozen other early risers
and, seeing the Foiled Bd’rrower standing adjacent to the
bookstall’s bundle of papers, he rushed up and extended
a penny to him, saying, “ Are you selling papers?” The
Borrower recoiled from the copper with the bitterest
sneer I have ever witnessed. “ Sellin’! ” he snarled,
“ I’M SELLIN’ NOTHIJC ! ” Then the gang plank was
flung down with a crash, and the pale youth and the
Borrower and the early clerks all crowded aboard in one
discordant herd and were borne swiftly away into the
mist.

The Milk Foods closely approximate in composition to
human Milk, the natural and therefore best nourishment for
the young infant.
They are as easy of digestion as maternal milk, and
provide a perfect diet for the formation of firm flesh and
strong bones.
The Milk Foods are absolutely free from any noxious
germs, and hence are far superior to cow’s milk as obtained
in towns-
No diarrhoea, digestive or stomach troubles need be feared
from the use of the “Allenburys” Foods.
The Milk Foods can be made in a moment, hot water
only being necessary.
The “Allenburys” Foods are so graduated as to provide
the maximum amount of nourishment that the child is able
to digest at the periods of life for which the foods are re-
spectively recommended. . For the robust and delicate they
are alike suitable.

“Let Go For’ard!”
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
I AM ’elpless in me bunk,
Oh, I’m dilly an’ I’m drunk,
An’ I’m bruised an’ black an’ sore;
I ’ave ’ad a rotten time,
An’ the winch she sez, in rhyme,
‘ ‘ I —won’t—get—drunk—any—more. ’ ’
But I listen for the word
That before I’ve often ’eard :
It is sweeter in me ear
Than the chorus risin’ clear
Of a skylark on the wing :
“ Let GO for’ard !
Let go for’ard ! . . .
Get a heave upon the spring ! ”
Now the row is done at last,
An’ they’ve got the lashin’s fast;
I can feel the joyful thud
Of ’er screw above the mud—
Though me soul an’ body’s sore,
I’m another kind o’ man,
I’m a real good doer—an’
I— won’t —get—drunk—any—more.
I’ll be ’eavin’ of the log,
I’ll be scoffin’ of me prog,
An’ the battered thing that’s me,
Will be Johnny Jones, A.B.—•
In the mornin’ I’ll be fit,
“ Let go for’ard !
Let go for’ard !
Take a heave upon the spring,
Get the gangway in a sling—
We ’ave ’ad enough of it! ”
When ’er screw begins to kick,
Though we’re silly an’ we’re sick,
Why, the bangin’ an’ the boom
Of the blanky engine-room—
“ Thud-er —ud-er-ud !
Cuss-yer-bones-an’-blood !”
It will make us good an’ well,
An’ we’ll give ’er bunkers ’ell
In the mornin’.
’Twill be pretty blue an’ white,
An’ I’ll get to sleep all right
To the music of the shaft
An’ the racket fore an’ aft;
For I’ve left me grief ashore—
Let go for’ard,
Let go for’ard,
She was peachy pink, an’ white,
An’ I wonder who to-night—
“ Let go for’ard,
Let go for’ard,
I—won’t—do—that—any—more.”
There’s a cure for you an’ me,
An’ it’s called the Open Sea,
I ’ave fell from ’igh estate,
But I’ll stand up square and straight
In the mornin’,
An’ the ugly thing that’s me
Will be bully of the sea
In the mornin’.
They ’ave shaken ev’ry fist,
An’ the girls ’ave all been kissed,
“Let go for’ard,
Let go for’ard !
An’ ’eave a-way aft ! ”
The smoke pours from ’er funnel,
There’s a rumble in the tunnel
Of the damned old shaft.
Now it’s hi! the open way,
And it’s hail the morrow day !
An’ a hundred miles from shore,
Let go for’ard,
Let go for’ard—
I won’t get drunk any more ! ”

Diogenes.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
DIOGENES, the celebrated Prime
Cynic, was born about 412 b.c., at Sinope,
a township on the Black Sea somewhere.
He comes down to us in history as the greatest
poser that ever lived.
It was an age of posing. Celebrities of that day
had to pose, or they would never have been taken
seriously or have got their stuff off. It is hard to
understand this to-day, when anyone who has a
guinea or two and has learned to hold a pen can
go to an agent and secure right off an 80,000 edition
for England and another for America, besides
whatever there is in the Australian rights. It was
not so in Greece, 400 odd. You had to posture in
the limelight, or you might as well be dead. No
pose, no boom. But no one else ever had the pic-
turesque insight into the essence of posing that
Diogenes had. He reduced posing to a fine art.
Diogenes was a man with a past. Tales, rattling
and furious, are told of him to this day in the bars
of old Athens. It was while in the middle of this
dissolute career that he pretended to be converted by
someone set down in history as Antisthenes. This
seems an obvious mistake. The man’s name mav
not have been Mawson or De Waverley (we have
no right to expect too much in these matters), but
Antisthenes smacks too much of the alias that has
overshot the mark. Not that it matters at all.
Whoever the man was, he had just started a Sal-
vation Army called the Cynics, and, there being
noWesleyans about (it was 400 b.c.), Diogenes
became a ’vert. He embraced the sect, and took
care to let it be well understood that he was prac-
tising the greatest austerity, and cared no more
for beer or wealth, and altogether despised the
comforts and linoleums of life.
History says he “let it be well understood,”
but that is rather a mild way of putting it. When
Diogenes posed, he posed and took no chances.
His way of letting it be understood, and adver-
tising his call to the simple life, was to roll a big
barrel up the street and, placing it on the foot-
path, bang up against the Town Hall, with its
open end out, to crawl into it and stop there all
day.
Not a soul would ever have known he was there
in the ordinary way, but a few coppers distributed
among half-a-dozen street Arabs saw to all that.
The boys would call the attention of passers-by to
the barrel. “See! Diogenes is in there ! ” And
then people would come and poke about a bit,
and, getting nasty, would go away again, sneer-
ing, “ Who is he, anyway ? ” But Diogenes
knew his book, and, as he expected, he soon got
talked about.
While he was away getting a long beer he would
leave his boots tilted up in the barrel to make
folks think he was still there. Once, for a lark,
one of the boys pinned a card on them : “ Back in
five minutes.”
At night, too, as soon as it was dark, Diogenes
would slide away on the tram to his red brick
villa in the north, where, with cronies of his salad
days, he would whoop things up far into the night,
and make up for the discomfort of the day. In
fact, for the remainder of his life (and he lived to
be 95) his whole existence was made up of riotous
jag at home and sleeping it off in the barrel.
It was during one of these nocturnal carousals
in his Queen Anne bungalow that he hatched that
grand conceit that has come down to us as the
boss legend of antiquity. It was the most magni-
ficent bit of posing that ever was, either in ancient
or modern times —a little affair between himself,
his barrel, and Alexander the Great.
This Alick may be described as a young man of
good parts and some excellent opportunities, but
wanting in ballast. He was himself the only
enemy he could not overcome, as they often told
him in the Band of Hope of the time. “Ah
me!” as Carlyle wailed, “if Alexander could
only have subdued Alexander he would not have
died of D.T. at a comparatively early age.”
Imagine, then, a young fellow like this falling
into the hands of a seasoned old rip like Diogenes,
and you have a case of the Prince Hal and Fal-
staff sort—the older corrupting the younger, with
even graver results.
Alick got into a way of dropping in at Stavely-
hoop (as Diogenes called his place in the hills, in
playful allusion to the barrel—his town office).
He would drink a glass or two, and sit on a sofa,
sadly, taking no notice of the music, dreamily
counting off on his fingers the precise possible
number of conquerable nations up to date. It
was a habit that grew to be very depressing with
him, and by about the fifth or sixth glass he
would be at the crying stage.
What exactly occurred between these two
worthies when they sprung the great wheeze that
was to become so famous can only be read between
the lines. We have to remember the great
distance of time, and sift the wheat from the
chaff, digging the truth out of records that are
written in ancient Greek, a vile tongue, discredited
now even by the English Universities, and not
spoken anywhere, except by people who call fish.
Taking one thing with another, it seemed cer-
tain that the idea was hit upon in the earlier
stages of exhilaration, before the night got stale—
that there was a good deal of nodding and wink-
ing, and that the whole thing referred to some
“ kid ” between them that was to come off at the
barrel next day. This much is borne out by
Diogenes’ last words, after he had punted Alick
down the path and out the front gate. They
rang out clear and distinct in the night air.
“Now don’t come till the afternoon, mind!”
And Alexander was heard, indistinctly, to reply,
“Oh, all ri, ifyewanto!” and all the way home
he kept saying to himself, “ Wongerwhynotinthe-
morning?” and even again to his mother at home,
“ Wongerwhynotinthemorning ? ”
Some writers assert that Alexander actually did
present himself at the barrel after all in the
morning a little the worse for wear, and that
Diogenes sent him away again, telling him he’d
spoil everything, and that it “ must be in the after-
noon ! ” But whether that is so or not, there can
be no doubt about the occurrences of the famous
afternoon itself. The street was at its busiest
when along drifted the Emperor, attended by his
retinue. He stopped casual-like, right in front
of Diogenes’ barrel, as if he’d never seen
it before. Of course a big crowd gathered
in no time, but Diogenes crawled to the
dark end of the keg and bided his time, letting
the assemblage get bigger. At last, as if the
rumpus of expectancy outside had wakened him
up from his beauty sleep, he poked his head out
inquiringly. This was the Emperor’s cue, agreed
on overnight for that stagey bit of dialogue, now
so famous.
“ I am Alexander the Great.”
“ And I am Diogenes the Cynic.”
“Is there anything I can do to oblige you ? ”
said Alexander.
“ Yes,” said the Cynic, taking time to get his
point well heard. “You can stand out of my
sunshine ! ”
The effect was electrical, and the shouting and
applause could be heard in Asia Minor. In the
first lull after it Alexander got out the rest of his
gag—something about how he would like to be
Diogenes, but it was an anti-climax, 'and fell ridi-
culously flat. As for Diogenes, he had disappeared
into the recesses of his barrel, as if he was really
too bored to continue the discussion any further.
It was superb—perfect. There had been two or
three other Diogeneses in the field, but this day’s
work knocked them all out in one act. There is
only one Diogenes now—he of the barrel that
cheeked Alexander the Great.
His Apophthegmatical Annual sold right out
the next week.
“Ah!” mused Alexander, studying the pave-
ment as he strode home afterwards ; “ I see now
why he said, ‘ Come in the afternoon.’ Of course,
the sun is not on there in the morning .” A wonder-
ful young man, but not great in all things.
“Fine bit of work, yon ! ” said people to each
other as they went home from business that night.
“Yes, I think myself it will take a lot of beat-
ing,” chuckled Diogenes, in the dusk of the twi-
light, as he padded out the ends of an old pair of
trousers and artfully fixed his boots to them, to
deceive the people while he was away at the
Olympic Arms.

Make Zam-Buk a Daily Need.
a day passes without some member of the
family getting hurt. Maybe the breadwinner’s work
makes him peculiarly liable to cuts or lacerations; the
boisterous youngsters are always running in to mother with
bumps and bruises ; and housework abounds with painful
knocks, burns, scalds and sprains for the fair sex.
Prudent is the man who keeps a pot of Zam-Buk handy
in his desk drawer, in his tool-chest, or in his pocket. And
far-seeing is the housewife who takes care to keep her home
constantly supplied with this pure and effective first-aid.
Promptly dressing an injury with Zam-Buk means speedy
relief from smarting pain. That’s why the children like
it. But it means much more—that your hurt will heal
up quickly and perfectly, without festering, without gather-
ing, and without harboring disease germs. That’s why the
“ grown-ups ” like it.
Zam-Buk actually helps to knit the flesh together—to
build new cells of healthy skin—acting just as Nature does.
A CARPENTER’S PRAISE.
Mr, J. Turnbull, of 29 Shemel Street, Waterloo, Sydney, says: —“I am a carpenter by
occupation, and in my daily work am constantly knocking my hands about. Cement and
lime getting into the cuts and sores causes them to fester, and, if neglected, would necessitate
niy leaving off work. Prompt application of Zam-Buk, however, gives instant relief. I
recommend Zam-Buk Balm to bricklayers, masons, carpenters and, in fact, all in the
building trade, where accidents are of such frequent occurrence.”
Zam-Buk is the ideal summer skin-balm, its soothing 1 , cooling and healing
virtues making it invaluable for sunburn, prickly heat, rash, sore feet,
mosquito and other insect bites, nettlerash, and other skin troubles so preva-
lent during the summer months. Obtainable from all chemists and stores at
Is. 6d., or 3s. 6d. large family pot (contains nearly four times the Is. 6d.).

The Song of the Shaft.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
The s.s. - was to-day picked up in a disabled condi-
tion and towed into port. She had broken her tail shaft.
There is still no news of the missing steamer ——•. It
is surmised she has broken her tail shaft, and is driftinpr
helpless in the Ocean.
—Daily paper every now and then.
I SPIN and sing in the gloom,
All naked and grey and blind ;
The galloping surges boom,
And the wake spreads wide behind ;
The engines rumble and sigh,
And call from their working place,
But the choir is still when it suits my will,
To silence my rolling bass.
I spin and dream in the dark,
And my servants come and go ;
They look at me stripped and stark
And see that the sweet oils flow ;
Shining, and mighty, and sleek
I mirror the lantern’s light
As we dive and reel to my Song of Steel
And journey on thro’ the night.
The bluff bows charge at the seas
And trample them down in pride ;
They scatter spray to the breeze,
And the ocean’s strength deride.
But if ever I cease my toil
Sullen and still they be ;
By my might they plod thro’ the wrath of God
Or plunge to Eternity.
The mast with its well-trimmed light—
Like a gracious maid and tall—
Bows thro’ the treacherous night,
As the black hills rise and fall;
Steadily over the deep
She goes on her lonely way,
Like a gallant craft—but the whirling shaft
Is her master, grim and gray.
I toil with a giant’s wrath,
I crave no peace nor rest,
I will travel South or North,
I will journey East or West,
Give me but steam and oil
And I’ll thresh on till I fail
By the hidden flaw in my hardened core
And the mad strength of the gale.
Broken I lie in my cell—
Motionless, silent and grey,
And the lamps like clots of Hell
With the lurking shadows play ;
Past in the grip of the sea,
She fights like a wounded thing
As she staggers back from the fierce wave pack
And the toiling hammers ring.
I seek the stars on the wave,
I gaze at Death in the trough,
Deep down in my rolling grave
At the pomp of God I scoff;
His oceans I thresh to foam,
And His seas I chase in twain,
Ten thousand miles to the Blessed Isles
And back to the world again.
I spin and sing in the gloom,
All naked and grey and blind ;
The galloping surges boom
And the white wake streams behind;
Triumphing over the Sea,
At the wrath of God I laugh,
And I know no law save the hidden flaw
Or the clang of the telegraph.

Two Aspects of Loyalty.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
WHEN the conductor appeared at the
door opening, the youth in the corner
seat scrutinised him with the air of a
detective. He was certainly an unusual-looking
conductor. To start with, he was middle-aged.
His face was lined, not with the lines 'that come
of suffering or bitterness or sorrow, but those'
which come of defeat—marks which are as dis-
tinctive as the tattooing of a Maori chief. The
face was that of a man of more than ordinary
mental power—the face of an educated man—but
it had stamped on it the terror that is born of
having the world—the pitiless, triumphant world
—crowding you into the corner and landing blows
on you for forty years.
The conductor pulled a-ticket with much labor.
In doing so, his book struck the hand of the youth’s
vis-a-vis and sent his threepenny piece flying over
the floor. When the conductor had recovered it
and handed it back with profuse apologies, he
slipped on the step and averted a tragedy only by
a frenzied grab at the handrail. The youth
grinned. He was satisfied. It did not need the
conductor to painfully lick his finger several
times, and still more painfully spend half-a-
minute disengaging tickets which persisted in
sticking together, to confirm the youth’s suspicions.
He smiled till the conductor looked up ; then he
glared into his eyes with murder in his own.
During the next mile the conductor looked in
twice, and the youth threw a glance of hate at
him at each appearance.
At the last section a ticket-examiner stepped on
board. The youth produced a ticket for his
scrutiny.
“ This isn’t a ticket for this journey,” said the
examiner severely. “ When did you get it ? ”
“ Just now,” replied the youth ; “ th’ conductor
gave it t’ me just th’ other side o’ Newtown Town
Hall.”
The ticket-examiner called the conductor from
therear of the car. There was a sotto voce con-
sultation, in which the conductor protested wildly
in dumb pantomime. The world was advancing
with clenched fists for another round.
“ I didn’t give you that ticket,” he said to the
youth, shakily.
“You never what?” laughed the youth. “I
like that. I paid you threepence for it just th’
other side o’ th’ Newtown Town Hall.”
The conductor seemed paralysed. His lips
parted, as if he would speak again. Then he
dropped back to resume his protests to the ticket-
examiner on the back platform. The pantomime
continued till the ticket-examiner alighted.
“I could have sworn he pulled that ticket of
yours,” remarked the other passenger,
“ You’d ha’ sworn right,” laughed the youth.
“It’s in my pocket now. That was one I got
yesterday I passed in. I reckon he’s done in all
right, the blackleg.’’

The Brave Days of Old.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
HOW The Omelet got his name no man
knoweth, but some of those who have had
monetary dealings with him at different
pony courses assert that it is because an attractive
exterior conceals the tact that he is in reality a
bad egg.
Such an explanation, however, has a tainted
source, and the fact remains that The Omelet’s
genial personality endears him to all with whom
he has no fiduciary relations, not least among these
being the “ Sons of Rest,” who bask in the solar
rays of the dressing-sheds, when they are not dis-
porting in the billows.
The Omelet was lying with his body covered
and his legs exposed, so that his complete frame
might present an harmonious color scheme, when
Percy the Prawn entered.
“What ho, Omelet,” he remarked, “still
follerin’ it ? ” ■
“ Yairs,” replied The Omelet, “no meetin’
ter day.”
Percy the Prawn divested himself of his gar-
ments and made them into a neat bundle, "en-
veloped in his towel.
“ Things ain’t what they usedter be, when yer
had th’ place in Castlereagh,” he observed.
The Omelet sighed. “Naw,” he replied,
staring at the sand fixedly for a few seconds, as
he thought on the glorious nights before a virtu-
ous Parliament passed legislation which snatched
away his living without regard to vested interests.
“That was a great night the Johns come,” con-
tinued Percy the Prawn ; “ I’ll never forgit it if I
live ter a hun’red.”
The Omelet smiled triumphantly. “ I reckon I
knoo a bit too much for ’em,” he announced.
“ That’s right,” said Percy the Prawn. “ You
knoo as how yer was right. But what about us ?
It was fair murder for the poor blokes inside, I
promise yer. I never want one more like that.
It near give me appendicitis thinkin’ of it for
months after. When th’ knocks come at the
door I reckoned it was on’y th’ Gilligan push we
was expectin’. Then th’ knocks come harder.
Then Shorty comes up yellin’ out as it’s th’ Johns.
My word ! If me hair didn’t stand up on end I’ll
go to work. You was aw right acos yer knoo all
about it. But things was on’y middlin’ wif us.
Th’ air seemed full o’ smoke ter me, an’ th’ others
was jest as crook as me. I was tryin’ ter git
through the walls. I was the bird in the gilded
cage, an’ aw th’ time you was there as cool as
could be, pickin’ up th’ stuff off of th’ floor. I
never knoo that till after, or I’d ha’ had a divvy
meself. ”
The Omelet laughed. It was a pleasant
memory.
Percy the Prawn grew excited as he recalled
the moments of anguish and terror. ‘ ‘ There was
forty o’ us aw roun’ th’ one winder. I was near
th’ front, an’ when the first bloke got on th’
winder sill he says : ‘ Let’s back. It’s too high ;
I’ll break me bloomin’ neck.’ ‘Break it,’ says
I. ‘Yer silly coot. Ye’ll git pinched ef yer
stay here.’ He starts ter argue, when Bobbo
hands him one an’ we heard him hit the
roof o’ the billiard saloon nex’ door. We thought
he’d wrecked th’ whole buildin.’ . ‘Wait till I.
tie a handkerchief roun" me trousers,’ says the
bloke in front o’ me. ‘I got new clothes on.’
‘ Blast you an’ yer clothes,’ I says. ‘ We’ll all be
in nick while you’re thinkin’ o’ yer clobber ’ ; an’
with that I give him a shove that sends him on
top o’ the frightened bloke. I come next. Then
the push started pourin’ out Hell for leather. It
was a great sight, I promise yer.
“They was about half through, l when the
blokes what was playin’ billiards comes out inter
the yard with their coats off. ‘ Ye’ll be through
on top o’ our heads*’ they calls out. ‘ We’ll fall
soft,’ says I. Then th’ bloke what owned th’
saloon starts yappin’. ‘ Yer ruinin’ me place,’ he
says. ‘ Shut yer head about yer place,’ we says.
‘Have some sense. Can’t yer see.we’ll all be in
nick if we don’t git out o’this.’ t An’“While we
was pitchin’, the push come on oh ter the w’inder,
bumpin’ on th’ roof till they was a hole in th’
slates yer could drop a robbo through without
touchin’ th’ edges.
“ ‘ Ye’ll ruin me table what cost two hundred
poun’,’ yells the bloke. ‘What-ho,’ says Bobbo.
‘ We’ll drop through the skylight on the table—
that’s one way down. The Johns’ll cop us if we
stay here.’ When he heard Bobbo, that there
bloke near cried like a kid. ‘ Ye’ll ruin me,’ he
yelled, ‘ be th’ time all yous wif yer hobnails has
jumped on th’ cloth it’ll be like playin’ on Pitt-
street.’ As Bobbo started foolin’ wif the skylight
ter open it up he yells, ‘ Here, I’ll git yous boys
out safe, if yer come this way ’ ; an’, wif that, he
drags a ladder outer th’ back shed, an’ down we
all troops as right as rain. We got out inter
Castlereagh, an’ saw the Johns still smashin’ at th’
door. How did we barrack when they got in.
Th’ worst o’ it all was they drunk all the liquor
up in yer room, Omelet.”
“Naw,” growled The Omelet, “that wasn’t
th’ worst. Th’ worst was when they summoned
me after all, an’ got me fined 30 quid.”
“ Well,” remarked Percy the Prawn, with a
wink at the other Sons of Rest, “yer had
30 boh o’ mine towards it—3o bob I lef’ on th’
floor when I scooted for th’ winder.”
“ Aw.” The Omelet was unsatisfied.

EXTRACT FROM “ SYDNEY MORNING HERALD,”
OCTOBER 1, 1908:
" ®ie Minister for Lands stated in the Legislative
Assembly last evening that experiments for the
eradication of prickly pear had been recently carried
out on the Scone temporary common under the
supervision of the Government Botanist. The ex-
periments included spraying by means of a Tyree
machine with arsenical solution of varying strengths
on different plots of land in the same locality. The
solutions were also injected into the top parts of the
plants and into the bulbs below ground. Where the
bulbs were treated it was found that the plants died.”
We supply Sprays of all sizes and Tyree Eradi-
cator for destroying: all kinds of vegretatlon.
