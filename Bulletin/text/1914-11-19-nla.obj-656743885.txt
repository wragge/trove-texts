Hudson’s Eumenthol TootH Powder
SECURES SOUND WHITE TEETH AND A HEALTHY MOUTH.
Some practical reasons why Hudson’s Eumenthol Tooth Powder
should be used for Cleansing and Preserving the Teeth.
BECAUSE it contains the Germicidal and Antiseptic virtues
that have made Eumenthol Jujubes famous the world over.
BECAUSE it is not only an Antiseptic and Germicide, but
cleanses mechanically, owing to the evolution of oxygen when in
contact with water or moisture.
BECAUSE it is the oxygen which whitens the teeth so wonder-
fully, and wards off decay as no other preparation for the teeth
can do, or will do, without affecting the Tooth Enamel.
BECAUSE the Committee of the British Dental Association
recommends Powder in preference to Pastes, Liquids or Soaps for
cleasing and preseiving the teeth.

The Red Page
The Australian Play
D. H. Souter interposes :
Louis Esson takes a rather gloomy view
of the prospects of the Australian drama.
Why in the name of the prophet must he go
back to Euripides or even Tolstoi for his
illustrations? He is, I presume, speaking
of an Australian dramatic literature, and
his chief grief seems to be that somebody
has preferred the lighter side of life to the
pessimistic themes of The Powers of Dark-
ness, Riders to the Sea and The Playboy of
the Western: World. We cannot question
his earnestness, for has he not written Dead
Timber, a playlet which, whatever its liter-
ary merit may be, holds a very distorted
mirror up to Australian Nature. He con-
demns Arthur Adams because he has written
a “commercial play,” which he damns both
in principle and execution. Why shouldn’t
a man write a commercial play? Let the
stage, the pul nit and the schoolroom still
be the educative centres of the earth, but
must we dress all their exponents in mourn-
ing garments, strew ashes on their heads
and encourage them to wring our withers
eternally ? i
He must excuse me referring again to
Dead 'Timber. Can anybody say that it is
a true picture of Australian life? Sordid,
non-moral, debasing and horrible in the
extreme, are the first adjectives which it
suggests to my mind. Such things may
happen in Australia, but they are no more
characteristic of Australia than the Wee
Jasper tragedy was a feature of our civilisa-
tion. He says the commercial theatre exists
only for those who are so depressed by the
dreariness of existence... . that they can
only find pleasure in a musical comedy or
an American farce. He is uttering false
shibboleths. Look at the crowds entering
any of our theatres. Not many despair-
ridden faces there, as a rule, not people who
seem to be taking a last chance for an anti-
dote to suicide. On the contrary, they
usually appear pretty well pleased with
themselves, except a Jew who growls at the
7s. 6d. stalls, but then some folk grumble at
anything. He knows perfectly well that all
grades of intellect and intelligence patronise
the theatre, so his gibe about “these dull
ones” misses fire. I’m not going to criticise
Adams’s play—the quality of its construc-
tion and all that sort of thing is beside the
question, and if Adams chooses to print it
that was his way of reaching a larger audi-
ence than was otherwise available to him.
But —in God’s name I ask, why did Esson
print Dead Timber? Was it to show us how
to realise “space, sunshine, wild nature and
primitive character”?
I don’t think Adams’s effort to write a
conventional comedy should be condemned
for that reason alone. I am certain it was
not written down to catch the public fancy;
I can’t imagine Adams writing anything pur-
posely bad or in fact writing anything ex-
cept as good as he could possibly write it.
How far he failed or succeeded is yet in the
balance. The piece has only had one try
out, and EsSon knows that no play has ever
reached success in the form it came from
the author’s pen. Rehearsals do much to
smooth down irregularities and strengthen
situations; but it is the two or three weeks
of actual representation with capable per-
formers working under the observation of the
author and the producer—who seldom, if
ever, are to be found under the same hat —
that evolves the clever play which runs to
good business in half a dozen theatres simul-
taneosuly. This, though, would damn a play
in Louis Esson eyes. To be successful it
must be dull, or morbid, or dirty; otherwise
—it isn’t Art —according to Esson.
H. Fletcher intrudes : —-
“What right has Adams, or anybody else,
to do less than his best?” asks Louis Esson.
To appreciate the question one must realise
the artist and his usual environment. Art
in any form is structure given to emotion.
Artists vary in their power of perception;
and the more sensitive they are the fewer
their appreciators —in a given percentage of
population; for the average person is so
coarse-fibred that he is only aroused by an
emotional brick. The artist person must
live—or thinks so. The average person has
the dollars: shall he be given what he wants
and provide the artist’s chop ; or the artist,
finding no market for has utmost best, turn
tea hawker? This question meeting every
evolving artist, sooner or later, is full of
subtleties. If he has great joy in creation
he will try in spare time to sell enough tea
to buy the choD ; but usually the artist • is
a poor trader, and he may have a wife and
family wanting boots and other things ; shall
they suffer while he creates the _ unwanted,
and —cruellest doubt —what he himself may
regard as poor stuff; later on? Swayed by
these considerations the artist, be it in verse,
paint, prose or play, becomes a vendor of
tripe,, trying to give good, honest entrails
for value received.
It may happen with a wealthy aris-
tocracy that patrons are found with a taste
above the herd ; but a penalty of democracy
is the dependence of the artist for financial
appreciation on the mass. Hence: the
democracy training artists, trains effiigrants.
If Adams or others can write comedy their
market is in an appreciative social atmo-
sphere. The only fairly reliable market
here for drama, is melodrama ; for pictures,
cartoons and advertisements; for verse,
rhymes about sport or outdoor life; for
music, jingling songs. Personally I think
the good Australian artist should stop at
home and do his best to cater for local
requirements; better a thousand posters on
city hoardings than a decent art product
locked up in the gallery of a Yankee mil-
lionaire.
We, taking interest in the “Red Page,”
do well to remember that for each one of us
there is a score loving “Sporting Notions.”
Ana ye bards' Why not Stadium, cane-
cutting, teat-pulling, footballing, cricketing
verse V Take my word, there are chops in
it.
The author has a word: —
Louis Esson accuses rue of not having done
my best. Mrs. Pretty and, the Premier is
my best —in that particular genre—the
modern light comedy. Its may be a poor
best—but that is a matter for decision by the
audience.
The Round Table for September
(2s. (id.) is an admirable war issue. _ Highly
informative articles upon the origins, and
ultimate issues of the w r ar, upon the intex - -
pretation of the German spirit, upon Lom-
bard-street in war, and the Austro-Se.rvian
dispute provide .matter of the deepest inter-
est. Grey’s speech in the House of
Commons is reprinted in full, and a careful
summary of the White Book is given. W ith
reference to the belief of the bloke-in-the-
street that this war is merely a Prussian
war, the quarterly remarks : “There can be
no question of the fundamental unity of the
reople in the present war. The moment
las come which they have been taught from
their cradles to expect, and they believe
their cause to be just... .Bismarck’s cult of
;iow;er, his disbelief in all but material
lorces, his cynicism, his lack *of scruple,
his brutality—these things indeed the
German people have taken to their hearts
and exalted like a religion. But his prac-
tical vision of a ‘satiated’ Germany, at
peace with her neighbors and content to
guard the greatness which he had given her
—that has been thrown to the winds for new
ambitions which could only be advanced by
constant aggression, and, if need were, by
war....The German jreople do not make
their Government; their Government makes
them.... The ultimate aim of German
Imperialism is indeed nothing less than the
destruction of British power, the humilia-
tion of England, and the partition of the
British Empire. From Treitschlce down-
wards that idea has been an absorbing pre-
occupation of German historians, and it has
become ingrained in the German view of
German destiny.”
Paul Hamelius, Professor of English Liter-
ature at the Li&ge University, lias no secrets
to disclose in his personal narrative of 'The
Siege of Liege (Laurie; Is.). He was a
non-combatant during its investment; he saw
little of the actual fighting; and already we
have had through the press a fuller account
of this siege. Yet his naive narrative is in-
teresting. The Belgians, he says, knew their
neutrality to be a very precarious thing ; yet
little effort, till too late; had been made to
prepare for the hurricane. The of
Li£ge were built amid Belgian protests and
complaints—presumably the Peace Society
has a Belgian branch; the forts were insuffi-
ciently manned; and they were in the pro-
cess of renovation when the storm burst. No
wonder that “despondency was universal.”
Some indication of the mental stress caused
by war is seen in his statement that during
that dreadful week he lost count of the days.
All had passed through so many inci-
dents and emotions that they used to argue
about what day of the week it was. The
Belgians were largely -untrained; and un-
trained goodwill became only a danger to
the population. A lesson that Australia is
beginning hurriedly to learn.
The second volume of Florence Sulman’s
Popular Guide to the Wild Flowers of
N.8.W. (Angus and Robertson, Sydney,
6s.) is a worthy successor to the first
volume, and a welcome addition to the
splendid series of Australian Nature Study
works published by this enterprising firm.
This second volume contains many more
pages and illustrations than the first —hence
its higher price. The 72 full-page plates
by Eirene Mort are not only artistically
composed, but, by their botanical accuracy,
form a certain means of indentification of
our varied flora. Wattles and orchids are
very fully treated and illustrated. Failing
the publication of color plates, which would,
by increasing the cost of the volume, place
it out of reach of the public for which it is
designed, this book is altogether satisfactory.
It had to come. The September Booioian
(London) has for its principal feature an
account of Charles Garvice. An enthralled
public learns that Garbage has written
about 100 novels, and that 7,000,000 Gar-
bage-tins have been sold. There are photo-
graphs of Charles in his grey top-hat,
Charles in his monocle, Charles pretending
to write, though he admits that he has
always dictated his novels, pictures of his
home at Richmond, his house in Devon-
shire, his cottage at Henley-on-Thames, his
fishing cottage at Dartmoor. The moral is
that if you can write as much tripe as Gar-
vice all these things, from the grey top-hat
to the fishing cottage at Dartmoor, will be
added unto you. Luckily he did not set his
ambition too high: “My ambition has been
and is to write novels which may be read in
the family circle without any harm to any
member of it, old or young. Not a very
high ambition, you will say; but there it is.”
There it is. Apparently Garvice is a good
fellow; hence his chairmanship of London
Authors’ Club and his selection as a judge
of Hodder and Stoughton’s prize competi-
tion for Australian novels. But these official
positions flatter neither the Authors’ Club
nor Australia.
During recent years an average of 700
books has been published annually in Ger-
many dealing with the subject of war.
The Biology of Bernard Shaw
Another “critical study” of Shaw, this
time by Joseph McCabe (Kegan Paul per
Dymock’s Library, Sydney). Behind the
laughter of the familiar blue-grey eyes,
McCabe finds “a stern purpose. He does
not utter paradoxes: he is a paradox
most moral immoralist, the most unselfish
preacher of egoism, the gravest humorist,
the most ascetic denouncer of the 10 com-
mandments that ever lived. He does not
smile at the people who take him seriously.
he smiles at the people who do not
Shaw is not a Celt. He is descended from
English or Scottish stocks transplanted to
Ireland in the 17th century, which have con-
sistently and carefully remained Orange
aliens in Catholic Ireland. But neither race
nor pedigree throws any light upon his wit
and intellect. He came from “a world ot
small snobs.”
He approached London with a high opinion
of himself and a hope that the new metro-
polis was intelligent enough to endorse it.
Instead of this he was to spend 10 years in
obscure, laborious and utterly slighted work .
a gifted artist, living in a mean lodging on
sixpence a day—he once told me—and hav-
ing to beg the sixpence from his mother.
For nine years Shaw lived in a cheap room
in grimy Osnaburgh-street, forging his liter-
ary weapon with the most singular patience
and the grimmest determination that may
be found in the lives of artists. In the nine
years he earned by his pen the sum ot to,
of which £5 was given him for writing the
advertisement of a patent-medicine. let
the pen labored on, day after day, and the
stream of manuscript flowed out and in
again witli a steadiness that promised to be
eternal. The black frock coat turned green,
the fray of the cuffs had to be clipped with
scissors periodically, the silk hat oecame so
shabby and limp that the back had to serve
as the front, the trousers were cheap and
baggy. , ,
McCabe finds the chief interest of Shaw s
novels to lie in the fact that they show how
far Shaw’s characteristic ideas had devel-
oped by 1880. “He was already a rebel
against his class, his creed, his whole in-
herited equipment of rules and standards.
He began with the Zetetical Society, then
he -was invaded by Henry George and Karl
Marx; next Belfort Bax, Stuart Glennie
and Butler gave him a philosophic creed of
Rebellion; finally with his disdain of science
and rationalism he became the arch-rebel of
London.
For the last 20 years there has been little
variation in his views Briefly, he is a
Socialist of the most extreme type in the
sense that he demands absolute equality ot
income in the social commonwealth ; if ex-
ceptions were to be admitted, he would be
disposed to grant the dustman more than the
Attorney-General. The child is to inherit
a fixed income from the State, and the State
is to see that, in mature years, it is earned.
In this Shaw goes far beyond his own asso-
ciates and enters the company of the most
extreme “enthusiasts.” But he promptly
differs from the extremists. He scorns de-
mocracy, restricts central government to the
task of federating the municipalities, regards
the idea of a revolution as melodramatic
nonsense, and believes that if the enthusiasts
could foresee the finished social common-
wealth they would abandon their enthusiasm
for it He is still to a large extent an
Anarchist-Socialist, and his whole. creed is
bent into characteristic and peculiar direc-
tions by his claim that happiness is far from
being the end of man.
When considering Shaw’s system of philo-
sophy McCabe naturally approaches it from
the biological and scientific side. He finds
that in Shaw’s theory of life personal sym-
pathies and antipathies have counted for
much more than a scrutiny qf realities;
that his is an attitude that takes no account
of the progress of knowledge, and is already
in large part antiquated.
His God is merely the Life-Force which
has at length reached consciousness in the
brain of man, will one day be the Super-
man, and may eventually be something
higher. A two-edged sword lies between
Shaw and the Christian Church.
Yet he is equally alienated from Rational-
ism. Shaw is almost alone against the bio-
logical world in denying natural selection
altogether. “As he knows nothing about
biology,” McCabe curtly adds, “we need pay
no serious attention to this. He is merely
repeating the criticisms, which Samuel But-
ler brought against Darwinism 40 years ago.
Of the vast evidence accumulated by biology
in the last 40 years be knows nothing
Shaw lingers among the small majority of
the reactionary and the prejudiced. His only
companions are Jesuit writers and unculti-
vated Methodists.”
The chief reason for this intellectual posi-
tion McCabe puts down to the fact that “the
sciemific men whose authoiity in tneii °...
department he derides are generally utili
tarians and defend vivisection and mea£
eating.” Delightfully Shavian!. So Shaw
remains to-day an anti-Darwinian.... tlis
position Is utterly indefensible when he pig
himself against the whole scientific wor
on a scientific issue such as natural selec
tion, of which he knows very little.... xne
paradox and contradiction of much of his
teaching....is due to philosophising on lite
without a knowledge of facts and o
common mistake of framing a general theory
on an exceptional temperament lor
Shaw’s latest discovery, the
I-'cCabe wifi have none of it. This vita
imething’ in the organism has been under
iarp discussion among biologists, tor ou
>arS, and the overwhelming majority ot
iem reject it....The truth is that Shawm
, naturally and unshakably virtuous that
; does not appreciate the need of mora
lies. He smiles, as an archangel would, at
ie decalogue.” . .. . fhp
In reply to Shaw’s conviction that the
orld is deteriorating, that no age is so
svful as this, McCabe points out that:
If Shaw had lived 500 years ago, he
ould have been burned at the stake or boiled
i oil; if he had lived 100 years ago he
■ould have been sent to Botany Bay, oi
ounded from country to country like fame,
r driven insane (as many were) m an
ihglish gaol. In our age he is respected
broughout Europe and the United States
nd can make £10,000 a year by libelling us
i his amusing way.
Of Shaw’s first seven plays one only was a
light theatrical success: six were complete
ailures from the point of view of represen-
ation. He had tried drama and tragedy,
omedy and farce, sociology and psychology
nd history, with almost equal unsuccess,
n spite of the high praise which some leafi-
ng critcs gave to one or other play there
vas something in Shaw which the. public
lid not like. For a time he despaired ot
•eaching the public through the theatre, and
■esolved to write literary drama. Publishers
lad been unwilling to bring out his plays.
But at last he found a publisher, and the
seven Ploys, Pleo.so.nt and Unpleasant, were
ssued. By the beginning of 1903 Shaw had
written 10 plays, and had had in the
theatre only one modest success. Ten years
if amazing industry, experiments in every
rariety of drama and comedy, had left the
general public callous or disdainful. And he
was 48. Then the tide turned. His plays
began to be performed before German audi-
ences, great critics like Brandes praised
them, and the United States welcomed them.
And Shaw published Man and Superman.
The most important question to Shaw is
whether he has succeeded in his much adver-
tised aim of using dramatic art for educa-
tional purposes. McCabe answers confidently
that Shaw has not succeeded to any great
extent. The reason is that Shaw has pre-
sented his case in so exaggerated a way that
his audience refuse to accept it as conform-
able to their experience. The public has
enjoyed the play and overlooked the philo-
sophy.
Man and Superman, for instance, has no
moral for the theatrical audience. They
know nothing of the Life-Force which impels
Ann to hunt Tanner and makes Tanner re-
luctant to marry her. To them Tanner is
an eccentric bachelor, and Ann. a young
lady of disputable taste ; even the impossible
fainting-scene at the close, when Ann keeps
her failing heart alive until she is assured
that Tanner has not repudiated her lie,
merely amuses by its very extravagance... .
The general public has become indifferent to
Shaw’s heresies, as long as he confines the
explicit declaration of them to the prefaces
of x his plays, which they do not read. They
like Shaw as a humorist, a wit, a paradoxist,
a creator of uncommon and clearly-defined
characters and lefreshiijg situations.
The Girl from the Back-Blocks, by that
consistent author, Lilian Turner (Ward,
Lock), another contribution to flapperature,
keeps to the high level of schoolgirl interest
reached by her earlier books. It is the story
of a firey little girl from Outback who comes
to a Sydney boarding-school to get the edu-
cation she obviously lacks. The plot has
ragged ends, and the conclusion is inconse-
quent, but the girls are Australian and alive.
The disadvantage of printing such books in
England is emphasised by such misprints as
“Manby” (twice) for Manly, and “grey
muse shark” for the better known grey nurse
species.

Getting Out of Bed
on the Wrong Side !
Did your husband get out from the wrong side
of the bed this morning ? Was he irritable,
inclined to grumble at everything and act like a
bear ? Don’t always blame his temper. More often
than not a man’s irritable disposition is due to
trouble with his liver or digestion and better
than all the soothing and coaxing, is just one or two
Cockle’s Pills
A REPUTATION OF OVER 100 YEARS.
Get him to take two Cockle’s Pills to-night and no matter
how depressed, irritable or out-of-sorts he felt this morning,
he will be as “ fit as a fiddle” to-morrow. Cockle’s Pills are an
invaluable corrective for all disorders of the liver or digestion ;
they are made according to the
prescription of a famous doctor
and are taken by doctors them-
selves.
The “Rocket”
was the first locomotive in the wo-rld to run for
public service. This was in the year 1830, ex-
actly 30 years after Dr. Cockle began prescribing
his valuable antibilious pill, which brought him
an enormous practice and world-wide fame.

MAKE UP YOUR
MIND TO HAVE
A PERFECT
BUST
There are to-day hundreds of women who were once thin, flat-
bosomed; hollow-cheeked and generally scraggly in appearance, and
suffering the effects of anaemia and defective digestion, who are now for
the first time in their lives healthy, full-bosomed and pink-cheeked, and
enjoying the full vigor of robust womanhood, as the result of a few
weeks under our wonderful
" FLESH-FOOD » TREATMENT.
Many women whose figures have been spoiled by maternal duties
have been entirely restored to splendid form, and flat-chested young
women who suffered slow development have had the fault corrected by
this treatment with lasting effect.
Flesh-Food is totally harmless in every respect. Its efficacy is
beyond question, and its use no demand upon the subject’s time. Many
cases gained up to six pounds a week, and an increase in bust measure-
. ment up to 8 and 10 inches. Guarantee given in every case.
AJNY WOMAN who lacks good bust development lacks the one essential that creates a perfect
appearance. Lack of proper bust development, hollow cheeks and “salt-cellars” quickly take from
a woman the bloom and freshness of healthy womanhood. Misfortune may have been your lot in
so far as natural development is concerned, but science has found a way to correct your deficiency,
ivven though you have never been full-bosomed, and though you have been attenuated all your life,
if you suffer from no wasting disease, your bosom can be fully developed and your weight increased
° noima . /T BEEN DONE FOR THOUSANDS WHY NOT YOU?
You can readily see the effect of an increase in your weight or measurements. It is not neces-
sary to imagine you are being benefited. See what Miss M. BOURKE, of Tamworth, says
_ “Yours to hand, and am pleased to state that your treatment increased my
weight considerably over two stone, and my bust measurements by several
inches. Since using it I am much better in health, and my flesh is now firm
and 1 feel stronger and more vigorous. I thank you for the trouble you have
taken, and am grateful for all you have done for me.”
We publish an interesting book on the subject of attenuation and develop-
ment, and will send same and a FREE SAMPLE TREATMENT to you FREE
OF CHARGE upon receipt of a 2d. stamp to pay part postage. All communica-
tions private and confidential. Write or call to-day for full particulars. [lBlB

VARIOUS VERSE
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
What the Wolves Said.
Wolves came round after the battle, tearing the
slam. —Recent message.
The wolves came round the Russian wounded
slinking,
The wolves came nosing round the German
slain;
Perchance they wearied of the river-drinking
And sought a richer beverage on the plain.
Perchance these shaggy cold-emboldened
howlers,
By timorous mortals christened “beasts of
prey,”
Felt kinship with the wounded human
prowlers,
And marvelled much what kind of wolves
were they.
For wolves beyond a shade of doubt they
must be—
These things that tore their fellows tooth
and nail.
And Grey Coat howls to Grey: “What can
the lust be
That drives these men beneath October’s
gale?
“To tear each other piecemeal in their
trenches,
To pin each other down with teeth of steel.
To fill the air with death and deadly
stenches,
And thunder-claps that make the forest reel?
“We wild four-footed hunters make no
slaughter
To slake our thirst as do these bipeds grim
Who pour each other’s blood like Dnieper
water,
And rend their brethren madly limb from
limb.
“There is no wood marauder lithe and
savage
Would glut his greed upon his ravening kind,
Our pack will take its fill of bitter ravage
And leave a taint of blood upon the wind.
“But never do we leave such witness gory
As these do, piled on hill and slope and lea,
Where rages Man —the Wolf’s a bygone
story.
There is no need on Earth for such as We!”

Suicide.
Never since Nelson’s days have so few ships been
seen upon the Channel. In normal times a various
fleet flying the flags of all nations is always within
sight. During two days this week the water was
deserted except for one suicidal old tramp, which,
deeply Jaden, went her way, careless though all
Europe be at war.— Sydney Telegraph’s London
correspondent.
“Careless of war”—because in London
town
The missus and the kids look for a crust;
In our floating cell we are perhaps con-
demned to drown —
Deep-laden to the seas because we must!
Suicide is nothing. Ours is daily suicide;
Sweating cash for owners from the
freight.
Kaiser Bill is nothing, and we let the
Germans slide,
For the owners’ greed is blind as German
hate.
Sixteen pounds a month for a tramp’s
master —
With a Dutchman’s stern, deep-laden, and
a cabin that’s a den.
What to us is hell and war and all the
world’s disaster?
What to us if German warships steam fifteen
knots faster?
There is no grub ashore for sailor men !
We ain’t no yacht that can winter on the
skids;
Ours to tramp the deep seas for the missus
and the kids.
“Careless of war” —for war is with us ever;
A hundred thousand pounds of freight
and ship,
And forgiven for a bad mark on your ticket,
never!
All responsibility is ours each trip.
Buy all our own charts for their naviga-
tion —•
Wonder they don’t make us buy the coal!
Kipling, the hot-air poet, calls us “shuttles
of the nation,”
“Heart of oak,” that’s steel without a
soul.
Apple-bowed from Cardiff down to Red Sea
ports with coal;
Back up Channel with the glaring freight
of Aden salt;
Kicked like a football by freight from goal
to goal.
When the belly’s empty, empty is the soul.
Not our courage, this, and not our fault;
Stronger than all Kaisers is the hunger-fear
that bids
Us to tramp the deep seas for the missus
and the kids.
“Careless of war.” From Liverpool to Leith,
Grimsby, Clyde and Sutherland and
Thames.
Though the Prussian sword returns not to
its sheath,
What care we for Dantzic. Kiel or Ems?
Three pounds a month in a British deep-sea
freighter;
Three feet of freeboard’s quite enough ;
Death may be to-morrow, or perhaps a fort-
night later—
To our lives death can’t be very rough.
“One suicidal tramp goes her way. deep-
laden,
Careless that all Europe be at war,”
Bound for Cadiz, Buenos Ayres, Tenerife
or Aden ;
Father earning more than salt for wife, and
lad, and maiden;
Father filling empty mouths by tramping
oceans far —
“Suicidal” tramps a-sweating cash for
Christian Yids,
Tramping down the stale seas for the missus
and the kids.

HERE are five reasons why you
should have a bicycle built of
Genuine B.S.A. Fittings in preference
to a cheap ‘pattern’ machine: —
1. You get far better value.
2. You get greater reliability.
3. You get an easier running machine.
4. You get economy in upkeep.
5. You get a much higher price for the
bicycle when you want to sell it.
In fact you get more enjoyable cycling always.
There’s no doubt a B.S.A. is cheapest in the end.
But apart from that you have a machine you will

DROPPING THE PIRATE.
The name of the Kaiser as Admiral of the Fleet has been struck off the British Navy List.
This is based to some extent on the famous picture, “Dropping the Pilot.” The difference lies in the disrespect of the dropper and the inverted attitude of the dropped.

PRISON LABOR AND MISCEL-
LANEOUS SUBJECTS.
On some bright, joyous morning, when the
sky is blue, and the sea and the land are
green, and the eucalyptus smells like I aia-
dise, and the koala holds high revel in the
top storey of the forest —some morning when
the Kaiser has hanged himself and all the
roads around Sydney have been put in good
repair—the Australian Labor party may
perhaps be persuaded to reconsider its
theory that the less work a country
does the more freedom and civilisation it
possesses. These remarks are partly based
on the fact that, a few days ago, at New-
castle (N.S.W.), Minister Hoyle, in the
ignominious language of the ‘push, re-
ceived “all that was coming to him.” The
grievance was the failure of the Holman
Government to absolutely prohibit anybody
working more than eight hours per day.
(At least it has failed to prohibit any trades-
union artisan working more than eight
hours per day, though doctors, nurses,
housewives and other toilers may work all
manner of periods.) Hoyle and his col-
leagues were roundly accused of having
abandoned the cause of “the workers” by
their failure to prevent them working so
much. Some of the remarks that weie
made to Hoyle would have been cruel if
they had been made to a dog. Some of them
might have seemed harsh if they had been
made to a cotton umbrella.
* * * *
The question of working hours is a diffi-
cult one. A community sets up a certain
standard of civilisation, which necessarily
includes provision for defence and a num-
ber of sundries if the civilisation is to last.
Its business is then to do enough work to
maintain the standard. If it makes the
best possible use of machinery; and the
best possible use of its harbors and other
natural advantages, which are really
machinery in a different form; and doesn’t
waste its money in carrying goods absurdly
long distances; and doesn’t sell itself body
and soul to the bloated landlords and specu-
lators of one big city; and if, in a general
way. it cuts its coat intelligently according
to the dimensions of its cloth, it may pay
its expenses with four hours work per day.
Under different conditions it may have to
work 12 hours per day in order to keep itself
out of the Insolvency Court. Civilisation
doesn’t consist in doing the least possible
amount of work and the greatest possible
amount of lingering. There is no more
merit in toiling eight hours a day than in
toiling one hour or 16 hours. The essential
thing is to do enough to keep the local civi-
lisation going, and to keep it on a steady
course of improvement. A man isn t neces-
sarily a “worker” because he calls himself
one. He may be really a fatted loafer, a
hanger around street corners, an attendant
at football matches, and an enthusiastic
advocate of borrowing.
*, * * *
These days the Australian “worker,” or
a large section of him, is a most enthusias-
tic advocate of borrowing. That is to say,
he is a slave-dealer, because he sells his
children into financial bondage, so that he
may have easy times, put on many frills,
and assume much “dog.” There is no rea-
son why he should not put on frills and
assume “dog” if he acquires the easy times
by good management of his affairs. A coni-,
munity which brings itself to the highest
pitch of efficiency by the use of the best
possible appliances, and which runs its
public affairs with a fixed resolve to make
the country self-supporting, has no need to
be an ox of burden or a dog dragging a
cart. But if it leads its easy life on
foreign loans it gets down to the level of
the Circassian parent who regards his
daughter as an asset, and trades her off for
cash to the Unspeakable Turk. As a con-
sequence, it ranks as a cad and a coward
and a time-server. A poor country with
many war troubles on its hands may be
excused for getting into debt, but a land
of “unbounded natural resources” —it is
impossible to remember how often we have
heard of them—and with no war troubles
has no excuse whatsoever. Australia to-
day depends less on plain honest work and
more on selling its flesh and blood to the
foreign money-lender than it ever did
before. It is the great, prize, boss, over-
whelming foreign Private Enterprise coun-
try of the globe, inasmuch as every allegedly
permanent public work it possesses, even
down to its highways and its by-ways, and
its telephones and its drains, and its harbors
and its defences, are up the spout, and
Private Enterprise owns the spout. This
is not the best time to clamor for shorter
hours. The great need of the country is
for shorter debt.
* * * *
Incidentally the same people who com-
plained to Minister Hoyle about free Aus-
tralians doing too much work, complained
about imprisoned Australians doing any
work whatsoever. The old plea was put
forward that they competed with free labor.
Now any Australian may get into gaol, by
the simple process of filling himself with
German beer or Greek brandy, and then
hitting an Austrian on the nose, amid a
patriotic discussion. But it doesn’t follow
that that misguided Australian should be
made a lunatic by solitary and useless con-
finement in gaol, lest the products of his
toil should compete against goods brought
from Turkey. Unfortunately the Austra-
lian Labor party has a deep-rooted suspicion
of Australian industry, and is a confirmed
sinker of the fiscal issue in the interests, of
foreign production—even if it be foreign
gaol production. It objects to make room
among its workers for the Australian wiio
is in temporary confinement, though the
goods produced by men who have been
“jugged” represent purely State or Social-
istic enterprise. The gaol population is so
small that there would be no need to worry
about its competition but for the fact that,
with the Australian Laborite, the importer
and ihoney-lender always come first, and the
scrap of work that is left after he is pro-
vided for has to be carefully conserved. If
the jobs were recklessly used up by prisoners
or by free workers who toiled unduly long
hours, Heaven only knows what would
become of the blessed shortage. It might
be killed.
DESPERATE DISEASES AND
DESPERATE REMEDIES.
The Bulletin receives the following letter
from N.S.W. State Minister Carmichael
(it has numbered the paragraphs for con-
venience of reply) :
(1) In criticism of a statement made by me to
the Daily Telegraph in connection with the N. S.
Wales Government wheat scheme, The Bulletin
(12/11/’l4) quotes me as saying “Desperate diseases
require desperate remedies,” and asks for details.
The “desperate disease” is found in a return fur-
nished (10/11/’l4) by the Labor and Industry Depart-
ment, which shows that 15,470 men are out of em-
ployment and 23,566 employed part-time. Added to
this is the certainty that these figures will increase
out of recognition when building contracts now in
hand are completed.
(2) The “desperate” remedy is the use of loan
money to provide work likely to be remunerative
within the first 12 months, and certain to create an
asset to the value of the amount expended.
(3) The Bulletin policy, on the other hand, is
something like a possible rescuer asking a drowning
man to wait till he planted a few cork trees in order
to make an Australian lifebelt, or imploring a starv-
ing man to take up another button in his belt until
the would-be philanthropist received a legacy from a
relative not yet dead.
(4) The Bulletin claims that because certain
members of the Ministry have not had the luck of
The Bulletin proprietary in running a paper, the
Government should not go into the wheat-growing
industry. Like other critics, it expects every general
to have worked his way up from hugle-boy. I am
credited with some measure of success as a Minister
for Education, but I know that I could not teach
worth 2d. My colleague the Minister for Works has
probably never handled a pick and shovel in his
life, but there are several monuments to his industry
as Minister for Works. My colleague the Chief Secre-
tary has greatly improved the Police Service, but, as
far as I know, he has never yet run a man in. If
every Minister is to be an expert in every branch of
the Department he administers it will mean the rise
of the professionally-trained politician and the down-
fall of democratic government. Each Department has
its own experts, and sensible Ministers act upon their
advice, subject to party policy and their own good
judgment.
(6) Thb Bulletin complains that the time is
inopportune for the Government wheat scheme because
the prospective drought and the shortage of seed
wheat are likely to deter farmers from wheat-growing,
and it proceeds illogically to add as furth
for Government inaction the “congested railways
forgetting that the scarcity predicted by itseif will
lessen, if not remove, the congestion; and, secondly,
the •‘unprofitable railways and tramways
again that the provision of Governmental w..e? . ‘
add to the railway receipts for carriage In fact it
is another evidence that The Bulletin has the fhnest
destructive plant in the newspaper world but it has
sat so long in the shades of opposition that it forgets
leconstruction must follow upon demolition.
(61 The Bulletin advocates a non-borrowing
policy and a high tariff, but it invariably dodges the
question where the capital is to come from to build
the factories that will provide employment without
having recourse to borrowed capital. It Kicks
against Private Enterprise; it advocates a ceitain
brand of Socialism, and it wants decentralisation ; but
again it fails to locate the gold mine that will pay
for the harbors, the wharves and the railways
involved.
(7) I cordially agree with the necessity for
decentralisation, but I do not see that it will come
in our time unless The Bulletin Bogey—Mr.
Maclsaacs —is allowed to exist. I claim that the
Government wheat scheme will:
(а) Provide immediate employment for thousands
of men. , „ , .
(б) Make land available ready for subsequent
productive occupation.
(c) Bring an immediate, but problematic, return,
since it is dependent upon the season.
(8) I would like The Bulletin to suggest any
better method that will enable the Government to
find immediate employment for its unemployed, but I
would stipulate that in making the suggestion The
Bulletin keeps to its own policy of non-borrowing,
and that the employment must prove reproductive in
at least the near future. As for its non-borrowing
policy, I presume The Bulletin has never worked
upon an overdraft to tide over temporary embarrass-
ment, and has never executed a mortgage for the
purpose of extending its business. Some day I hope
to see the Government, of which I have the honor to
be a member, resurrect (?) certain financial Bills I
sponsored in the Assembly, capitalising the public
debt and making the public services responsible both
for interest and sinking fund. But the present is not
the time to talk of this.
With all possible brevity The Bulletin
replies to Mr. Carmichael, N.S.W. Minister
for Education: —
(1) The N.S.W. State Government has no war to
provide for. Its loans are still going strong. Its
Federal subsidy and its lands and railways and
tramways are to be found at the old address. If
anything has gone wrong in the alleged crisis it is
in the matter of trade and commerce, and that is
Federal business. The State Government has no more
to do with it than has the Balmain Municipal Coun-
cil or the Presbyterian Assembly. Of course, it can
always buzz round like any other busybody or blowfly,
and gain applause and votes and continuance of salary
by heaping huge debts on the infant (who has no
vote), and thus making a cheap pretence of humani-
tarianism. The pretence may pay the crowd in
office, but it is rough on the infant.
(2) The Holman Government was using up loan
money at the rate Of £8,500,000 a year before the
war commenced or the crisis arrived. (The crisis, by
the way, may really arrive a year hence.) Loan
money is growing more and more unattainable
though the present year is provided for. It is now
proposed to meet the crisis—which isn’t the Holman
Government’s crisis except in the sense that it will
buzz into things that don’t belong to it—by means
of still more loan money, which it probably can’t get.
It hasn’t an idea in its head, apart from raising loan
money and leaving the kid to pay the damage. And
it talks of its new works becoming remunerative
inside 12 months. When did any of its works become
remunerative ? If they did why the need for all
these fresh taxes?
(3) The Bulletin’s idea is that Australia should,
by means of a short Act which could be passed in a
week, double, or more than double, the customs
duties. Thereby it would greatly reduce the ruinous
outflow of money which goes to pay for the products
of many doubtful friends and some obvious enemies.
On the eighth day it might begin to save some coin
of its own—the coin that now goes to German im-
porters. On the ninth day it might begin to build
new factories with its own coin. The implication
that it can’t have any money except what it borrows
from Maclsaacs is a gross insult. Mr. Carmichael’s
idea is that N.S.W. should start, at great
outlay of loan money (it is difficult to keep
loan money out of any narrative with which he is
connected), to raise a small wheat crop that may or
may not come up two years hence. Which of these
parties is it that calls On the drowning citizen to
wait till the cork tree is grown?
(4) This paper suggested in passing that Holman,
said to be a journalist, didn’t make a great success
of a daily paper. And if Holman, who is not said
to be a farmer, makes a success of wheat-growing it
will be surprised.
(5) This paper fails to see that the difficulty which
the Government finds in shifting the wheat which
already exists along its congested railways will make
the removal of extra wheat any easier.
(6) The Bulletin, as Mr. Carmichael says,
advocates a non-borrowing policy. And Mr.
Carmichael and his friends pledged themselves to a
reduction of borrowing, and declared it to
be quite feasible, at a time when loans were
much less than half what they are now. Therefore
the only difference between this paper and Car-
michael is that it has adhered to the Labor policy
while the Labor Minister has turned dog thereon.
The Bulletin certainly kicks against Private Enter-
prise. Carmichael and co. are slaves to Private
Enterprise in the matter of pawning our people to
private capitalists.
(7) Mr. Carmichael can’t see how decentralisa-
tion (of which he cordially approves) is to come
about unless the State borrows money. Well, as
already mentioned, he belongs to a gang or horde
which promised to reduce borrowing, and that flock
or multitude also promised decentralisation. It has
multiplied loans and it hasn’t decentralised. Now
will Mr. Carmichael say how much in the way of
loans (will £30,000,000 a year be enough?)
N.S.W. will require before decentralisation begins,
with his crowd in office? And was all the talk about
decentralisation and the reduction of borrowing a
mere dirty political swindle or public lie or Par-
liamentary sham that was passed on to an unsuspect-
ing public?
(8) Mr. Carmichael asks if The Bulletin never
had an overdraft. It had. But (a) it gave sufficient
security; (5) it didn’t heap taxes on anybody or
reduce anybody’s salary to meet the interest on the
overdraft; (c) it didn’t pledge itself publicly to
avoid the overdraft and then rush into the nefarious
thing; (d) it didn’t bolt into the overdraft two years
before a war and then plead the war as an excuse;
(e) it didn’t promise a sinking fund and fail to
provide one; (/) it paid off the overdraft.
There are some other points, but space is
running short.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Absurd Emden Hero-Worship.
It is time someone arose in shining armo
and said that the fuss and applause which
are being heaped on the captain and otnceis
of the Emden for their valor, gentlemanly
conduct, chivalry, politeness, skill, heroism,
etc., are being overdone. As regards the
valor this is the Emden s record: It tor-
pedoed two very small and ancient war-cratt
bv sneaking up to them under the Japanese
flag. That apparently constituted it a mere
pirate. It captured a lot of wholly unarmed
merchant craft; and it went down in a heap
in its first real battle. As regards the mat-
ter of skill: It was protected and kept in-
formed by an immense number of spies who
ran private wireless stations. As these
stations were uprooted one by one, the supply
of inside information diminished and the
Emden walked into a trap in open daylight.
It proved a very poor shot, both in its
engagement with the Sydney and when it
slew three niggers and a tank at,Madras.
To come to the matter of courtesy and
gentlemanly behavior: The officers of the
Emden must have known that they were
doomed to capture. There was no back
track to Germany for them. If they had
acted in the regulation German fashion they
were liable to be hanged. So they organised
themselves into the hollow square of a bril-
liant exception and conducted themselves m
the fashion best calculated to secure them
good board and lodging when the inevitable
happened. That is to say, they were almost as
decent, with a most powerful motive of self-
interest, as any set of British or French
officers would be without such a motive.
They shone by comparison with other Ger-
mans, but they didn’t shine by comparison
with anybody else.
♦
The Magnificent Hoi.-Griff. Attitude.
One day last week Minister Griffith, of
N.S.W., rose on the lower surface of his
boots to complain about the criticisms aimed
at his Calico City, outside Sydney—the
place wherein several hundred families are
to be accommodated at one bob per week with
dirt floors, or one bob and half a bob with
board floors. He said, with all the pride
of a patent agent a mile high, that there
were two classes of people (presumably
meaning children and fools) who shouldn’t
see a job when it is only half done. He
didn’t allege that the descriptions of Calico
Town were untrue. In fact he could hardly
do so seeing that descriptions were officially
published; and that the building of the
huddled place is sufficiently advanced to
make all its glories and its drawbacks, and
its garbage tin, and its lack of facilities for
decency visible to the naked eye. And he
said nothing about the wonderful borrowing
and importing policy which created the need
for Calico Townr—the policy which has made
the Ma State a sort of beggar in a tent,
just when the desolation of war has set up
a demand for raw produce and manufac-
tured goods which should make Ma a million-
airess in a palace. His general attitude was
that, when the profound Griffith proceeds
to build Calico Metropolis with public
money, but without any public authority—
a thing of that sort not being on the party
programme—the unimportant people who
supply the money for the Rag Babylon
should make no complaint until com-
plaint is quite useless. Whereupon Premier
Holman took up the parable, and urged
the public not to enter into uninformed dis-
cussion about his State wheat-growing de-
vice until the thing is in working order. He
considers it fair to reserve criticism. If the
community had elected Holman on a State
wheat-growing programme this might be _ a
reasonable proposition. It would be a dis-
tinctly good proposition if Holman was
growing the wheat with his own money. And
ic wouldn’t be a very bad proposition if
Holman’s previous unauthorised excur-
sions into State enterprise had paid their
way a little better than they have done.
As matters stand the idea seems to be that
the very intelligent Hol.-Griff. Ministry
may do anything, it likes with the public
cash, and do it without obtaining any
authority from the people; and that the dog
who carries the burden mustn’t bark ex-
cept when it is too late for barking to
matter. This view of the case appears
excessive—in a humble way. No Pope or
Kaiser or multi-millionaire or Oil Trust or
pirate—no brass god with a new belltopper
on his ear, or squatter with his jumbucks
on a thousand hills —could ask for much
more. The present office-holders of N.S.W.
came into power on a brilliant and well-
defined programme. As regards a large -‘sec-
tion of it they have done nothing. As regards
another large section they have carefully
done the thing they denounced and have
perpetrated the act which they professed to
hold accursed. With a record of that sort
the demand for a blank cheque suggests
swelled head. It almost suggests swelled
feet in addition.
Slums of Sydney.
The N.S.W. Premier has struck a new line
of defence for his Calico Town or Humpy-
ville. He holds that the people will be
better off there than if they lived in the
slums of Sydney. This appears rather rough
on Sydney. It sort of implies that the
vaunted old hamlet isn’t fit to live in. With
a greatly improved Building Act and _ a
Greater Sydney scheme, neither of which
Holman and co. have supplied. Sydney
might be a more than respectable place.
Then again, the city might not be quite so
slummy (if it is slummy) but for the con-
gestion policy which chases so much of the
population on to one little bit of ground. Thus
the population of N.S.W. is estimated to
have increased by 130,216 between census
day in 1911 and 31st December, 1912. And
of this increase 65,297, or more than half,
was crammed into Sydney because the new
cities which were to start under the decen-
tralisation policy- never started. Any place
becomes a slum if it is sufficiently crowded,
but the case appears to be one in which
Sydney should throw a clod at Holman
instead of Holman aiming his shocking and
ungrateful brick at the town which has done
so much for him. There are, roughly speak'

Ing, 185 square miles in Sydney and its
suburbs. The free, bright, glorious, kangaroo-
haunted region that stands for the rest o
the State—the land of glowing sunsets, and
wheat, and wine, and joy, and Bill JIM, a . n . f *
poetry, and Piker’s pub, and the illimitable
distances, and the new order of tilings,
and the tall, deep-bosomed women, and
the jumbuck that frisks upon a billion
hills—it covers more than 309,000 square
miles. If the Government policy shoves
more than half the new population
on to the ISS square miles and less
than half on to the 309,000 square miles
which represent the “great natural re-
sources,” then the Government should not
scoff at its own handiwork, and make a
virtue of its scoff. Especially it shouldn t
do so when it is trying to crowd more people
on to an acre than many a good robust slum
can boast of.
Private Enterprise Patriotism.
“Henry Horsecollar” says things:—
These Labor people have an amazing faith in Pri-
vate Enterprise. Thus a certain R. A. Adams, secre-
tary of the Painters and Decorators’ Union, addressed
a recent ham and tea picnic at Clontarf (Sydney) to
this effect:—•
There is altogether too much pessimism because of
the war. I venture to predict that the ultimate ,
result of this world’s conflict will be a great impetus...
to Australia, and it will make her people mote self-
reliant. Goods always known as “Made in Germany”
will in future be made in Great Britain or her Posses-
sions. Australia, as a manufacturing country, ought
therefore to make rapid strides. r
But why trust to Private Enterprise or Private
Patriotism to ensure that Australia will “make rapid
strides?” When the war is finished Germany will be
One of the cheapest-labor countries in the world—a
country of widow-labor and spinster-labor and child-
labor, and one that is ready to toil for a crust. Amid
the rush of trade, our old friends Gottschalkem-
berger and Blumenbiereniieimer, the importers of '
Sydney and Melbourne, when they bring in the cheap
Teutonic imports, won’t necessarily have them
branded “Made in Germany,” any more than the
Kaiser’s secret-service agent necessarily puts “German -
Spy” on his door-plate. They may fly a bogus flag,
as the Emden did. And there is no possible guarantee
that the Australian will pay 25 per cent, more for
his goods on the unsupported assurance of someone: —
possibly named Schmidt —whom he doesn’t really
know from a crow, that they are British, and not
German.
Voluntary education has been given up as a bad
job. So has voluntary trades-unionism; and volun-
tary arrangements re working hours and: wages; and
voluntary divorce; and voluntary removal of garbage;
and voluntary payment of taxes; and voluntary
honesty and sobriety and abstinence from profane
language. Australia has even lost faith in voluntary
defence. It has gone further, and dropped its belief
in the voluntary payment of debts and in voluntary
imprisonment. It doesn’t trust the convict to flog
himself for breach of gaol regulations.
Consequently, the idea that Private Enterprise
patriotism will keep out alien competition and boom
Australian manufactures when the strife is com-
pleted makes me tired. Let us try Public Enterprise
or Socialistic patriotism, in the shape of a strenuous
tariff for the protection of these good members of the
British Empire, the Australians. Then we will be
sure that Gotterdammerung, the importer, who possi-
bly calls himself Jones, isn’t ringing in German or
Austrian or Turkish goods on us under a false
description.
This Private Enterprise patriotism which the fiscal-
sinking and tariff-sinking Labor party tries to pass
on us.is a worse fraud than an Oil Trust. It is too
trustful and too oily.
Wanted: A National Forest Policy.
“Alf Austral” puts the case for Federal
control: —
The craze for importing which causes Australia
to every year send over £2,000,000 to foreign
countries for softwoods and other timbers is likely
to have consequences that were not thought of till
the war dragged them into the light. Prices of
European softwoods have been steadily rising for the
last 10 years, and now there is going to be a famine
whichever way the tide of battle runs; for forests
are being destroyed, foresters who are liable to
military service are being killed or kept away from
their work, and all the destruction of property will
provide such an attractive home market when re-
building time comes that exporting will be for-
gotten, or prices raised still higher. The demand
has already put American timber prices to the
“highest yet.”
Forestry is one of Australia’s urgent national
problems; but, though attention has been drawn
to it scores of times, either vested interests have
been too powerful or public apathy has led to the
important question being pushed aside. Though
five of the States possess Forest Departments, either
they are not endowed with sufficient funds to be of
any use or they aTe hampered by want of legislation
to give full control over the timbered areas; so the
question is very little further ahead than it was 25
years ago. In three of the States the departments
have no money for afforestation. They are merely
instruments for the collection of revenue from those
whose interests it is to destroy, under legislative
sanction, all the choicest reserves they can obtain
a footing in.
In Queensland, with an area larger than that of
any leading European nation except Russia, and
with forestry ranking third on its lists of primary
wealth industries, and one man out of every 13 de-
pending on timber for bis living, the field staff
consists of four men —or did until recently. Effici-
ent supervision is impossible in those circumstances.
The neglect is all the more inexplicable when it is
remembered that Queensland possesses the largest
area of commercial pines in Australia, while many
valuable cabinet woods are found in that State
and Northern N. S. Wales that are not to be obtained
anywhere else in the world. From a business point
of view alone it would be a good investment to
appoint sub-departments to watch over the valuable
cabinet woods in' the States, and to report on, test,
and popularise the use of these splendid timbers.
Monetary stringency alone cannot be urged as the
sole reason for'neglect in Queensland, as a revenue
of between £50,000 and £60,000 is returned per
year from the sale of timbers, while the expenditure
on foresters’ salaries and afforestation amounts to
a few hundreds pounds per year only.
N. S. Wales has a more efficient Forestry Depart-
ment, but here again the smallness of the staff
puts revenue-gathering in front of more vital con-
siderations. The annual report indicates that, in-
stead of the State assisting the Department, the
Department hands over a revenue of many thousand
pounds to the State, forest destruction being put
first and afforestation practically disregarded. The
only substantial thing that is being done is with
prison labor. In Victoria this is the position in
the words of the chief of the Department: “The
revenue balances the expenditure, and the Depart-
ment does not cost the State a penny.” It does.
It costs millions. For, by reason of the starved
expenditure, during the past two summers forest
fires raged unchecked for days in the mountain
forests, and destroyed over 300,000 acres of virgin
bush.
Tasmania has no Forest Department. The islanders
have not realised the vast timber wealth that has
been presented them by Nature; so timber destruc-
tion, disguised as i ’nd settlement, is allowed to go on
unchecked by legislative action.
Westralia has a Department of Woods and Forests,
but it is a futile thing, mainly used for the collec-
tion of statistics and revenue. In these circum-
stances, can it be wondered that the wonderful
jarrah and karri forests, the like of which do not
exist anywhere else in the world, are being wasted
at a prodigal rate? But a day of reckoning is not
far distant, for it is calculated that 30 or 40 years
will see the extinction of accessible commercial
timber; and, as a jarrah tree takes 100 years to
come to maturity, the West will experience a rude
shock before some of its young men are very old.
The State itself has also reared up a timber-
destroying agency in the shape of State sawmills.
Under Democracy, unless the public is educated out
of its selfishness, the Government which gives most
away carries most weight. In the face of a popular
demand for throwing open reserves that should be
closed, what hope at “present would the Director of
Forests have of gaining the day? Scientific forestry
is, under the circumstances, an utter impossibility.
South Aus. has a microscopic Forests Department,
which, at its present rate, would take centuries to
make any appreciable difference to the wooded areas
of the State. One can gauge the size of its opera-
tions by the stress that is laid in the annual report
on a dozen or two date palms grown in the Far
North, and producing a few pounds of edible dates
per year.
This is a brief record of Australia’s forestry con-
ditions ; and as some of the Departments (Victoria’s
in particular) have been in existence for 25 years,
and as a timber famine —-“so blighting in its effect
that it will be felt in every household in the land”
( vide U.S.A. Forestry Report)—is looming in the
older lands, it is time active steps were taken in
the Commonwealth to try to keep here some of
the £2,000,000-odd that annually goes to the
foreigner.
At the best, there are six sets of control; and
even if each State was in earnest, which is not the
case, much waste would be eliminated by having
one central authority, working under : uniform laws
and regulations, and one policy adapted to local
circumstances. The Australian Commonwealth could
keep one central Forest School going full time, and
find employment for all the successful students under
a vigorous national policy. No form of State enter-
prise, under scientific management, would pay better ;
and its concomitant benefits in the way of conserva-
tion of moisture, prevention of erosion and protection
of bird and animal life are incalculable.

The Patriot with the Gamp.
A question which looks like growing more
insistent as the war goes on is: Does the
fact that the Empire is fighting Germany
and Austria justify individual citizens in
disregarding the law of the land? Under
the heading, “A Case for Searching In-
quiry,” the S. M. Herald printed the other
day a letter from one Alex. Wilson. In
it Wilson said that, while eating soup in a
restaurant, he heard someone insulting the
English. He rang up the police, but before
they arrived he “jabbed the offender in the
face with his umbrella.” A constable hav-
ing transpired, Wilson “endeavored to
jab the man again, but was prevented by
the man’s friends and the manager of the
restaurant,” Wilson was very properly
arrested and charged with assault. The
magistrate, however, let him go—under the
influence, apparently, of some distorted form
of patriotism—and the next day one
“British-Australian” wrote complaining
that “a respectable citizen should be dragged
through our streets like a pickpocket as a
reward for his very properly exercising his
right and duty as a citizen” “British-
Australian” wound up by calling for a
Town Hall meeting to ventilate the alleged
outrage. The proposition is apparently that
apy citizen who hears, or thinks he hears, a
German, or one who merely resembles a
German, passing remarks derogatory to Eng-
land, may (to quote Alex. Wilson) “make
a serious assault on the foreigner, easily
amounting to possibly grievous bodily harm.”
If serious bodily harm, why not also mur-
der? Yet the law no more permits people to
murder an alien enemy—however noisy and
objectionable—than it encourages the man-
slaughter of bishops. Should a German use
language calculated to produce a breach of
the peace, there is a simple method avail-
able for dealing with his case. And, un-
questionably, it ought to be put into opera-
tion. If the ordinary processes of the law
are to be abrogated, and offensive language
on the one side is to be met by umbrella-
jabbing on the other, it is going to be
unpleasant for peace-loving citizens of all
nationalities. Every drunken bully or
brawler who wishes to excuse an unprovoked
attack on a harmless stranger, German or
otherwise, will fall back on some such
defence as that the later said “Hoch der
Kaiser.” In any case, Australian magis-
trates are not called on to encourage the
Alex. Wilsons in their self-advertising
antics. The Law, if it wants to retain the
respect of level-headed folks, will squelch
with equal severity the bounding soup-eaters
who jab Germans with umbrellas, and the
bounding Teutons who blither about the
Fatherland in public resorts.

Worse than War.
The President of the Newcastle (N.S.W.)
Chamber of Commerce made a few remarks
recently concerning syphilis. He told of
two cases. In one a sailor was treated at
the local hospital and then sent to Liverpool.
He found Liverpool dull, seemingly, and, as
there was no one with the right to hold him,
he came back, followed by the doctors’ warn-
ing cry that he was still a public menace.
In the other case a seaman signed on an
outward-bound vessel, but before sailing time
was found to be syphilitic. The captain
promptly handed him his walking ticket, and
he walked accordingly-—ashore, and into the
crowded city. Once in the city, this man,
who was too loathsome to be allowed to re-
main on a ship, was as free as air. Both
he and the arrival from Liverpool are at
liberty to pollute as many as they please and
so perpetuate unspeakable suffering and
misery. The world is horrified at the mor-
tality and physical and mental agony that
are being caused by the War, for war on the
present scale is a novelty. The devastating
effects of syphilis pass almost unnoticed,
partly because it is not considered genteel to
discuss this disease, partly because it has
always been with us; and the familiar has
a way of ceasing to be terrifying. Yet
syphilis does more for the death statistics
year by year than any war, and, as a har-
vester of sorrow it stands in a class by itself.
The relatives of those who fall in battle
derive a certain comfort from the reflection
that their kinsmen died doing their duty.
Nothing but shame is the lot of those whose
relations die from one of the diseases of
syphilitic origin. No one ever recovers, for
example, from general paralysis of the in-
sane. And the London Lancet (11/7/’l4)
remarked: —
Of the total admissions to the asylum of the
County of London every year over 10 per cent, are
G.P.I. sufferers; more than 15 per cent, of the male
admissions are general paralytics, and these are
recruited from men of all social grades.
Syphilis not only slays as ruthlessly as any
army corps; it is also a tireless swallower of
the public funds. The same issue of the
Lancet said: —
Most cases of organic dementia, imbecility, idiocy,
epilepsy and brain-softening are due to syphilis.
Moreover, it is the most potent cause of nervous
disease, and the sufferers with these diseases do not
die in a short time, as is the case in general
paralysis, but have to be maintained for numbers of
years in asylums, infirmaries and institutes for in-
curables. Numbers of other incapacitating diseases
due to syphilis might be mentioned — e.g., aneurism
and aortic disease.
How incredible it will seem to future genera-
tions that Australia should have let year
after year go by without doing a thing to
check this horror! The time is inevitably
coming when syphilitics will no more be suf-
fered to wander at large than plague or
typhoid subjects, or than the lepers whom
they in many respects resemble. But why
should it be delayed one unnecessary day?

Melbourne’s Gaud Mayor Hennessy, just
set in the chair for the third time, is a white
man who sometimes permits his affability to
exaggerate facts. The other day eight people
were re-elected unopposed to that archaic
institution, the Melbourne City Council.
Hennessy, in congratulating the barren fig
trees, remarked that their unopposed return
was proof of public satisfaction with them.
The truth is that they had no opposition
because nobody takes any interest in the
City Council —nobody, that is, except a few
genuine public servants (such as Hennessy
himself) and the axe-grinders and the
climbers who find in the Town Hall an open
door to the place where they may become
the also-rans of society. Melbourne copied
its present system of municipal government
from England, and England copied it from
France, and France got it from Darius or
Tiglath Pileser; and as it hasn’t changed
much it has become a ridiculous anachron-
ism. London found it barren of practical
result and superseded it with the County
Council; and Melbourne will get no fruit
worth the eating until it follows in the same
lines. The people who at present congre-
gate at the Town Hall do the city’s work
badly or not at all, because councillorship is,
by councillors regarded as nrobation for the
mayoralty, which ends (with luck) in a cheap
overseas title. So little use or real public
spirit is there in most of those elected, that,
if Australia prohibited the importation of
titles, the majority of them would disappear
The right thing is the Greater Melbourne
Council, elected on adult suffrage, and with
payment of members. Citizens would then
have a right to demand from elected men
something for something, whereas now they
can expect from unopposed nonentities the
nothing they get.
+ .
With a certain measure of pride the N.S.W.
Government announces that it sees its way
for the final seven or "i months of the finan-
cial year. It is to get a loan of £7,500,000
from the Australian Government —duration
of loan and rate of interest not yet an-
nounced (let it be hoped that the interest
won’t reach 10 per cent.), perhaps because
the Australian Government doesn’t quite
know how it stands. The Sydney Ministry
really implies that, provided it gets the
money, it will subscribe to any wicked old
dashed terms. Then something has been
raised at 5 per cent, in Adelaide (it is a
picturesque idea that the proud old. Ma State
should go pawning itself to Adelaide). One
way and another £9,000,000 is said to be
available to pay for works which probably
won’t return half the interest on the loans,
but which will serve for 7i months or so to
provide wages and a great disregard of con-
sequences to the crowd which- votes the
Holman ticket. After this obscure trifle
is spent it is reckoned that the ordinary
resources will be about exhausted. There
is a narrow limit to local borrowing, for the
country is being steadily drained of. money
to pay for a huge excess of foreign imports
—much of them the products of dubious
friends or almost assured enemies—so that
our own people may be unemployed, except
on relief undertakings built with the coin
that is to be repaid by posterity. For the
N.S.W. public works are now, to. a great
extent, frankly and avowedly relief jobs,
constructed to give the community a pre-
tence of having visible means of support
while it drinks German beer and smokes
Turkish tobacco. But the name of the mys-
terious Norton Griffiths firm is again
mentioned. This misty and hidden concern
was alluded to, some time ago, as a Private
Enterprise which would find a . certain
amount of money for the Socialistic State
of N.S.W. if the interest was high enauriu
and the security good enough. 1 And
alleged to be still willing—on the same
terms. Almost anybody would be.
The Commission appointed to inquire into
the causes of the Huntly Colliery (M.L.)
disaster has handed in its finding. It is the
most damning document that has been
hung in the wind for a long time.
Though the Commission weighed the
company down with most of the blame,
it told the local miners’ union that
its own negligence was a large contribu-
tor to the fund of trouble. Paragraph 11
of the summary says : “The inspection by the
workmen’s inspectors was infrequent and
valueless.” But that may be merely begging
the real question. Who was responsible for
the inspection by the miners’ inspectors being
slack? Was there victimisation? Were men
passed out who showed any backbone or were
thought to be capable of it? If so, then the
whole responsibility belongs to the owners;
they must be suffered to. divide it with nobody.
In any case, some action must follow. The
owners had been warned that they were
imperilling the workmen. They took the
risk. That points, in this paper’s opinion,
to only one charge—manslaughter.

“O’Piiimerty” : A large number of Tas-
mania’s expeditionary force are men from
Zeehan and Mount Lyell, whence, for years
past, they have been sending big supplies
of galena and copper to Germany. It is a
queer policy that sends the chap who is
getting ready to fight you the stuff with
which to lay you out; but it seems good
enough for Australia. Anyhow, what would
be the use of metal industries to us —we
who even haul our wool across the world
and back again when we want a pair of
pants made? Hewers of wool and drawers
of corks —that’s our industrial ambition!
A few years ago, when Gregory Wade was
Premier in Sydney, that dull person made a
bid for popularity by establishing a Railway
Superannuation Fund of an amazingly lib-
eral character. That is to say, it promised
benefits at a mere fraction of. the price that
a first-class life assurance society would ask.
A great many harsh things were said, mostly
by The Bulletin, re the impossibility of
the whole business, but Gregory plodded
in thick boots along the road to fame and
votes. Now the glad news is announced
that the N.S.W. Railway Superannuation
Fund isn’t likely to fall back upon the
Treasury for support (i.e., to become in-
solvent) for another two years. So G.
Wade is plodding in thick boots along the
back track from fame and votes.
A Mixed Battle Song.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Lo! the Boar’s tail is salted, and the Kan-
garoo’s exalted,
And his right eye is extinguished by a man-
o’-warsman’s cap ;
He is flying round the fences where the
Southern Sea commences,
And he’s very much excited for a quiet sort
pf chap.
For his ships have had a scrap and they’ve
marked it on the map
Where the 11.M.A.5. Sydney dropped across
a German trap.
So the Kangaroo’s a-chasing of his Blessed
Self, and racing
From Cape York right round to Leeuwin,
from the coast to Nevertire ;
And of him need be no more said, save that
to the tail aforesaid
Is the Blue Australian Ensign firmly fixed
with copper wire.
(When he’s filled the map with white men
there’ll be little to desire.)
I- was sulky, I was moody (I’m inclined to
being broody)
When the news appeared in Sydney, bringing
joy and bringing tears,
(There’s an undertone of sorrow that you’ll
understand to-morrow)
And I felt a something in me that had not
been there for years.
Though I lean in the direction of most abso-
lute Protection
(And of wheat on the selection)
And, considering Congestion and the hopeless
unemployed,
I’d a notion (but I hid it) that, the way
the Emden did it,
’Twould be better for Australia if her “com-
merce” was destroyed.
You may say that war’s a curse, but the
peace curse may be worse,
When it’s lasted till it’s rotten —rotten from
the inmost core,
To the mouldy skin which we are, in the land
we call the freer —-
And I almost feel inclined to call for “Three
Cheers for the War!”
For I think, when all is over, from Magellan’s
Straits to Dover,
Things will be a great deal better than they
ever were before.
But, since “Peace” and “Right” are squal-
ling, I’ll content myself with calling
For three rousers—like the ringing cheers
we used to give of yore—
For the Emden !
For the Sydney !
And their gallant crews and captains—both
of whom we’ve met before!
And, for Kaiser William’s nevvy, we shall
venture three cheers more !
Cheers that go to end a war.

The Prussian Murder—so Far as It
Has Gone.
Through another week of dull, embittered
slaughter the Bear in Sheep’s Clothing has
carried the frost and burden of the scrap.
He has on his hands the whole Turkish war
save the bit that the British fleet and
the Indian troops have been able to under-
take by the capture of Red Sea forts; the
whole Austrian war save the item that the
little States of Servia and Montenegro can
shoulder; and about half the German annoy-
ance. The rest of the German annoyance is
carried by France, Britain and Belgium.
Still, the Bear has advantages to compensate
for the weight of his burden. He isn’t fight-
ing on a narrow front which the enemy has
covered with entrenchments, but on a strag-
gling line GOO miles long. The maddest
Kaiser can’t dig (>OO miles of trenches, even
if the ground wasn’t frozen. So the Russian
in his sheepskin clothes, with little money,
but unlimited supplies of food, gains ground
daily, and his friends, the wolves, help him
to eat his enemies. Apparently the Russian
is familiar with his wolves, and simply says
“Puss, puss !” when the pack comes along;
but the German doesn’t know them, and
can’t speak their language. The other Allies
have fought like madmen all the week for
about a mile of ground in Belgium, and for
the heap of smoking ruins that once was
Dixmude. It has been a bigger struggle than
the whole Peninsular War, and every clod on
that bloodstained area has become a soldier’s
sepulchre. In many places there are two
German sepulchres under one clod. For
about the tenth time the German rush
for Calais lias failed. The entire slay-
ing is now guessed at 1,500,000 or more—
probably more. Britain has called for an-
other 1,000,000 volunteers, and if they aren’t-
forthcoming in good time compulsory service
will be in sight at last. Also, it has issued
another war loan equal to almost the whole
Australian debt. Servia, which had fired off
practically its last cartridge and its last
copper, and had put every male on two legs
aged between 15 and GO into the firing line,
has been brightened up with a loan of
f. 500.000, and is once more doing battle on
three meals .per day. Germany, with its tail
dragging on the ground, has asked Russia in
an undertone what it will take to make a
separate peace, and thus relieve the pressure
on the Berlin Homicide. No business event-
uated, for the Bear in Sheep’s Cloth-
ing stuck to his allies. Austria is
reported to be inquiring, in a muffled
whisper, as to the price' at which
it will be allowed to get out, leaving its
insane ally of Berlin in the soup. A few
more rumors of this sort are likely to bring
Roumania and Italy in on the side of the
Allies. They both want some territory from
Austria at the settling up, but they want to
come at the eleventh hour and get their share
of the profit cheaply. If Austria makes a
hurried settlement on its own account these
two confirmed opportunists may be left. That
persistent German commerce-destroyer, the
Emden, has been obliterated off the seas by
the Australian cruiser Sydney. Considering
that, if there had been no Australian fleet, a
cruiser worth £200.000 or so might have held
up our big coastal cities for £50.000,000 ran-
som, no one can say that the policy of main-
taining a local sea-force hasn’t been vindi-
cated. Maoriland, which established no local
sea-force on the ground that anything of the
sort would be contrary to its im-
jwirial traditions, admits reluctantly that
existence of the Australian squadron,
even if it wasn’t a very big one, probably
saved Auckland and Wellington from plunder
or destruction. Maoriland is raising troops,
but being the same old. thriftless, easy-going
place, it has decided that a war-tax is un-
necessary, and that it is only needful to float
an extra loan and charge the bill for the
patriotism to the infant. The British Empire
lias lost an ancient and valuable patriot by
the death of Earl Roberts, who passed out
in France at the age of 82. He died within
sound of the guns, at the headquarters of the
greatest army which Britain ever sent
abroad, and with the satisfaction of knowing
that the policy of compulsory military service
for which he had battled so long was at last
vindicated, and that the British people were
sorry thev hadn’t lent a more previous ear
to the old warrior’s appeals. Some riots at
Constantinople, the execution of a German
spy in the Tower of London, the continued
disapuearance of the Austrian Emperor, and
the fact that the Spanish Government has
mentioned that Spaniards shouldn’t be exe-
cuted promiscuously by drunken and hoggish
Germans, comprise most of the balance of
the week’s war news.

“The Yeomen of the Guard” began a six-
nights’ run at Her Majesty’s (Sydney) on
Saturday. Age, while it stales neither the
music nor the wit, is less merciful to some
of the characters. Charles Walenn’s Jack
Point is hardly young enough to win sym-
pathy as a forlorn lover ; and Dorothy Vane,
though she sings and acts artistically as
Phoebe, fails to suggest the coquettish
mediaeval child that she is supposed to be.
The impersonation which appeals to the
writer most is Albert Kavanagh’s Shadbolt
-—a preposterous but exceedingly comic
figure. Edward McKeown, of the sweet and
excellently-produced tenor voice, plays
Colonel Fairfax. His defect in such a part
is the recollection of his own loveliness,
which appears to haunt him remorselessly.
Miss Ethel Morrison fails, inasmuch as she
is a Dame whom no sane gaol or other official
would want to avoid. Her singing of “The
Screw May Twist,” with its fine chorus, is a
gratifying event. Miss Pearl Ladd, G.
Villiers Arnold, Frank Wilson and Miss
Caff.vn are all good, and the chorus, though
somewhat inadequate in size, does its duty
nobly. The co. will play “The Pirates of
Penzance” and “Trial by Jury” on Saturday
night.
* * * *
“A Daughter of Israel,” now finishing a
summer week’s sprint at Sydney Adelphi, is
by the authoress of that immense sob, “No
Mother to Guide Her.” Apparently the
woman slush-dramatist has watched and
weighed the worst work of her more de-
graded brothers, and has deliberately set out
to out-slush them. Needless to say she is
succeeding like a bucket dredge. The comedy
of the Daughter is hopeless, and the mem-
bers of the co. who attend to that depart-
ment don’t improve it. Frank Neil, as the
comic detective, does his young best, but
his performance suggests a school breaking-
up. The serious part of the absurd and
unnecessary drama is attended to by players
of more skill. Miss Oriel Hotson deals
successfully with the part of Judith Levi,
the adventuress who drinks ginger-ale with
great abandon and goes mad for the benefit
of thirsty spectators. George Cross is a
distractingly beautiful and dutiful young
nobleman in an evening dress suit which
looks as if it had boards in the shoulders.

drama are (1) the lisping girl-child who
escapes suffocation, (2) the uproarious old

At Sydney Criterion it is getting on to
“Seven Weeks of Baldpate.”
Sydney Repertory Theatre began a festival
week of Australian drama, on Monday, witn
“Mary Martin,” a three-act play by • ■ •• ••
Mary is a disconsolate young woman witn
one child, who has been deserted by her liter-
ary husband. She is having a tairi>-
wretched time as housekeeper in a sharp-
tongued feminine household, when a wealtnj
and unimaginative manufacturer of bed-
steads (who believes her to be a w-idow) per-
suades her to marry him, so that he can take
care of her and her delicate small boy. J-hey
are getting along very nicely in the second
act when the honest, blundering bedstead-
maker brings home the first husband, whom
he has discovered at his club. The ancient
absconder, who has made his fortune as a
dramatist, tries to break away when he dis-
covers who his hostess is. Being forced to
remain, he yearns -to reconstruct his family
life, and begs his own wife to abscond with
him and bring along the small son, who is a
promising lad. The honest bedsteader in-
terrupts them in mid-scene, and. after giving
a touching exhibition of strong man’s
agony, during which he begs to be allowed to
think, he produces some deadly _ bedstead-
coloring stuff and mixes it with wdne. The
two men start a game of chess to decide
which is to take the poison. While they are
playing, Mary tries to take it herself, but
drons the glass in her agitation. Then the
first untimely husband produces some lethal
play-writer’s ink from his vest-pocket,
swallows it, and so scratches himself for all
engagements.

The framework of the play is good, hut
?? V?? every now and then writes a
sermon instead of a speech, and puts it into
the ■ mouth of a character to steal away thfe
interest. He should collaborate with a cour-
ageous sub-editor. Miss Ruby Coxhead, who
played the title part (the play is now an
event of the past), was a smileless heroine
who never let people forget that she had the
world against her. Without actually giving
the glad eye, she might have provided her
three admirers with some shred of excuse for

and sulkiness are not a lonely woman’s trump

stead manufacturer, blundered along very
naturally; while Gilburt Howell preached

Hamilton earned honorable mention for a
good study of a priest.
The season, which is in aid of the depend-

Concerning various Sydney moving pic-
tures
Crystal Palace : “The Mystery of the Sleeping
Death,” being more or less a spook yarn of a man
who sees his wife only once in a thousand years.
Special performances for married men.
Lyric : “Confetti,” a mix-up of love, jealousy and
cab accidents.
Colonial Theatre : “Till Death Do Us Part,” the
usual “appealing story of devotion,” etc. Also Mary
Pickford does a turn in “The School Teacher and the
Waif.”
Empress Theatre: “The Wedding Barque,”
wherein a “beautiful gipsy girl escapes from the
clutches of her cruel father,” falls in love with some-
one else’s boy, and is “torn with conflicting emo-
tions and despair.” The extent of the damage hasn
yet been made known.
“THE YEOMEN
OF THE GUARD .”
Jack Point.
“War prices” and quick changes are tin-
policy at Melbourne Princess’s just now :
that is to say, the tariff has been reduced by
half, and “The Sledge-hammer” is for six
nights only. “The Sledge-hammer,” by
Wilson Barrett, gets in some striking effects
and a lot of stodgily-respectable dialogue, but
it is overcharged with sin and sadness. The
comic relief made strenuous efforts to amuse
a cheap and crowded audience on Saturday,
especially when the soubrette slipped down
a well, and her bloke delayed his rescue of
her in order to finish the beer ; but the drama,
as a rule, bore a harrowing appearance. The
fact that the amphitheatre sometimes made
merry over a murder or manslaughter metely
indicated that the harrow had not touched
the amphitheatre’s soul. The architecture -bf
the story is of the gruesome domestic order.
An elderly rural farrier has a wife, a
brother (who resembles Uncle Sam) .and
three sons, two of whom are only stepsons to
the matron. These two share the crimin-
ality between them. The loud, boozy son
causes the old man’s death by raising a hand
to him, after which the boozer and b's dnl 1 ,
sulky brother conspire to kill their poor step-
mother because she is about to marry again
and break up the family _ estate. They
divide responsibility for the crime, like the two
murderers of the Duke of Clarence, or Mr.
and Mrs. Macbeth, and having done the deed
they fix it upon their good young stepbrother,
who loves the artless heroine. This brings
the heroine into action. The result of her
warm endeavors to save the innocent is that
one of the guilty brothers kills the other with
a light and airy sledge-hammer, which he
wields as though it weighed half a ton.
:J: * * *
The principal opportunities for forcible act-
ing fall, firstly, to Rutland Beckett, who is
unduly loud and melodramatic as the drunken
brute; secondly, to Jack Kirby, who plays the
milder brute admirably up to a point; and.
thirdly, to Miss Gwen Dorise, as the heroine.
The lady is bright and intelligent enough, bbt
much too amateurish for her difficult job.
D’Arcy Kelway is happy in a comic black-
smith part; Nellie Holroyd puts too much
color and action into her soubrettishness;
and Conway is a conventional guiltless hero.
Among the others C. R. Stanford is conspicu-
ously unlucky. He plays the heavy father
with marked ability, but is doomed to death
in the first act. During a thunderstorm in
the second act there is some reason to
hope that Stanford’s ghost will revisit the
drama. The family speaks of his spectre as
a likely thing to happen. It fails to event-
uate, however. “No Mother to Guide Her”
comes next on the Princess’s list, and will
begin with a matinee on Saturday.
* * * *
The only Melbourne bill that sticks is “The
Girl in the Taxi,” at Her Majesty’s. Since
the first night Paul Plunket, a tall baritone
with a toothy smile and a stiff but well-
tailored denortment, has taken up his part
of the giddy lieutenant. This was filled by a
smaller young man at the outset. Otherwise
the cast is unchanged and all things are as
before. In a cast where everybody, with
one notable exception, has the merit of look-
ing like the person that he or she is sup-
posed to be. Miss Engler takes first honors
for a particularly successful impersonation
of a baroness. The amiable baroness ex-
presses faith, hope and charity—not to add
credulity.

also new, and for the rest there are Fatima,

general.

The history of Lucille Love isn’t finished

Hoyt’s. Olympia the crowd has been bending
its excited gaze on “Business v. Love,” “The
Convict,” and “Those Husbands,” whereof
the last is an especially humorous study
of two elderly transgressors and their sinful
diversions.
From an Adelaide critic: —
The 17th picture-show of the S.A. Society of Arts
is hard hit by the absence of notable work from
other States. At the first glance one imagines the
local people have dropped timidity and gone in for
composition. This idea proves on closer examination
to be due solely to a group of big, broadly-handled
poster-effect things by Marie Tuck—Scotch fish-
market, Brittany funeral, and so on —and to one bold
effort by J. F. Scott. The rest of the show is much
as usual. Hans Heysen’s gum-trees are pretty nearly
his great Red-glow of last year under a different
light, and Gwen Barringer shows that she has caught
something of his spirit. Similarly, Miss Priest pro-
duces a seascape that might be Will Ashton’s. Ash-
ton himself has a Seine-at-Paris scene in his best
style, and contrives to be unlike himself in a Dutch

landscape. His father, James Ashton (now President
of the Society), sticks to the seashore, though he
supplies a reed-bed’s effect on the lines of his picture
in the Adelaide Art Gallery, which is possibly the
best thing he ever did. Edward Davies and John
White maintain their own standard with local scenes,
but any prize for the most improved painter would
have to go to Gustave Barnes for his statue-figure of
Pan in a woodland setting.
❖ * :!:
The Williamsonian Opera Co., giving
“Princess Caprice,” disbanded after a joyous
final evening at Adelaide Royal. , ( .It was
“Emden Night,” and Jack Cannot was really
funny. He revelled in gagging; then “Now
to get back to the book,” he would cheerfully
suggest. “The Glad Eye” has since arrived.
Most of the players are new, but Ethel Dane
is of Adelaide origin, and Frank Bradley
had a fine record with the local Appendreena
Dramatic Society before he became a pro.
The Tivoli, after moving down to the Oval
for a few nights, resolved to close for the
present. This is all to the advantage of
Branscombe’s Dandies, for whom Marguerite
Leroy is doing good dancing and Cahill good
work on the piano. At the King’s, which
keeps on with Variety, Henri French is back
on a return visit. The Exhibition has been
crowded for a pageant to help the Belgian
fund, and other efforts (including Melba’s)
are to follow. West’s has the fine, gladia-
torial “Spartacus” film, the Star a Kelly
Gang hash-up, Wondergraph and Pav. war
pictures. Waller (late of the Butterflies) is
back from London, and talks confidently of
opening his projected Austral Gardens —at
the old Ayers mansion on North Terrace —in
a week or two.
AT POVERTY POINT.
“The Cracked Tenor”: “Theorbo,” in his
tribute to Lempriere Pringle (B. 5/11/T4),
does not say enough about his best part—the
demon in “Faust.” The Tasmanian wiped
the floor with any other Mephistopheles I
have seen in this part of the world, not ex-
cepting Edmund Burke, who had so many
bouquets thrown at him at Covent Garden.
Pringle revealed all the grimly sardonic humor
of the character; moreover, as he had been
for two years with Julius Stockhausen, a
fine teacher of singing, he knew most of the
points of the game. Then he was of good
presence, and looked well whether he played
the genial devil in Gounod’s opera or the
offended monarch in “Lohengrin.” When
he came back from England in 1900 as the
leading basso of George Musgrove’s team,
he used to make everybody sit up and take
notice from the moment he entered Dr.
Faust’s study in a blaze of red fire. He did
so well on that tour—and he had a record
of success in England before that —that
Musgrove brought him back soon afterwards
to appear in opera selections with Melba.
But because he was one ‘ of their country-
men Australians never went off their heads
about him as they do over vastly inferior
people who come from the other side of the
world and modestly allow press agents to
call them “great.”
Eric Maxon, who, having completed his
“Within the Law” engagement, was to
leave for America this week, was chiefly note-
wothy for having much the same elocution
as Lewis Waller, though Waller had a
voice of hetter quality. The resemblance
was more a coincidence than a matter of
mimicry, perhaps. Waller was not the imi-
tator, anyway; so. it was rough on him that
the younger man should have come, first into
the Australian field. The first-comer is
rarely the original in these cases of imported
acting. Instance - the notorious case of
Frank Thornton, who imitated Edward Terry
in “Sweet- Lavender” almost as closely as he
imitated Penley in “The Private Secretary”
and “Charley’s Aunt.” A notable case of an
original being eclipsed by a more powerful
actor was that of J. H. Clyndes and Charles
Warner. The latter, who made a name for
himself in “Drink,” had finished a long sea-
son in Australia* just, before the arrival of
Clyndes, who played heavy-villain parts with
an imported melodrama co. The resemblance
between the voice and elocution of Clyndes
and Warner was startling. They talked as
one man; and naturally the smaller man was
accepted as the copy of Charles Warner.
But, as a matter of fact, he was the old
suburban London actor whom Warner in his
youth had worshipped and borrowed his
mannerism of speech from.
Maoriland was represented by no fewer
an th ree .song-birds during thfe opera season
at the Middlesex Theatre, Drury Lane.
Ihey were Adelaide van Staveren, daughter
°t the Rabbi of Wellington; Nora D’Argel,
the same gusty city; and Mrs. Manson,
once Mabel Braithwaite, of Dunedin.
“Mdb”: The usual comedy nowadays is
an affair of cuddle, slobber and hugger-
mugger, addressed to young girls. All is to
come right in the end. Witnesses of “The
Climax” (Florence Young and co.) expected
the usual right ending; but the ending was
neither right nor wrong. The eminently useful
question raised is the incompatibility of
artistic and domestic life. There is a new book
°u “Motherhood,” contributed to by all sorts
of eminent people. The most pupgent is a
London actress. She blames the public for
being the virtual authors of an unvirtuous
rule, that the actress is to be a married
woman without any family, or possibly
with just one spoilt doll of a child. Mr. and
Mrs. Robertson, in the generation before
last, had 20 children, and almost the twenti-
eth was fine, strong Mrs. KendaL The
Terrys, Rignolds, Cathcarts and other old
theatrical families may be instanced; and
then the present hectic, unnatural system
came in.
“Private Boxer”: If I were a mummer in
the mirth-provoking line, I should stipulate
with the manager that I played nothing but
waiters. I’ve never seen a bad waiter on the
stage—-that is, a waiter-part that was bad.
The actor may be rotten, but the part is
invariably a button-burster. Take Alexis
in “The Girl in the Taxi.” He is quite the
most human and most amusing character in
the farce; as good in his way as Shaw’s
immortal William in “You Never Can Tell.”
It’s a pity real waiters are not something
like their stage brothers. If they were I’d
get out of the counter-lunch habit to-morrow.
Two old Melbourne identities well' known
to the profesh passed out in the early days
of the war, unparagraphed and unsung.
Brown, the theatrical hairdresser and expert
wig-maker, was followed to the Shades by
chemist Beddome, who had a large theatrical
clientele for make-up and toilet mysteries.
Or perhaps the chemist predeceased the
barber. Anyhow, they are both dead.
“THE GIRL IN THE TAXI. ”
Among the chorus:
Something imported.
Giddy young
Lieutenant.
Thus G. R. Sims (viciously) : “There is
one remarkable result of the war with Ger-
many. For the first time for many years it
is a material advantage in England to be an
Englishman.” As an almost incredible illus-
tration of what the craze for .the .foreigner
has been, a playwright vouches' for it that,
in the mania for German and Austrian
opera, an English author who had the luck
to get a libretto accepted by a London
manager had it suggested to him that he
should let it be done first in Germany, and
then presented in England as a translation!
“Norbell”: The bellowdrama of “The
Kelly Gang” was a favorite with the late
Dan Barry. Dan’s co. was playing the
piece up Wangaratta (Vic.) way, in the
heart of the Kelly country. One day Dan
had great difficulty in finding a bellman, and
as a last resource he put on a disguise and
paraded the streets, clanging a bell and
announcing the show. That night, when
Dan made his first entrance as the outlawed
hero, a stentorian patron exclaimed dis-
gustedly : “That’s not Ned Kelly; that’s
the old cove that was ringing the bell.”
“H.H.”: Nowadays London is kept dark
at xigkt lest the enemy’s airships should
locate tie city and drop bombs on it. So the
old drama, “Lights o’ London,” is at a dis-
count.
TURNED AWAY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I went up to see what they had
At one of the houses in town;
The play was certainly bad —
The co. was doing it brown.
Two score were perched in the gods,
And-growled it wag over the odds.
Set round the circle were ten,
And five, perhaps, qnay have paid.
The stalls were sprinkled with men,
Half paper, I’m sorely afraid*,.; h
Remained not twelve of the crew
When lights were down for Act 11.
Ere Act the third had commenced
I, too, went home to my bed;
And then it was that I sensed
The truth of placards that read,
Concerning pros, and the play:
“We’re turning people away.”

SNELL.
The Royal Art Society.
When the Royal Academy was created
under Charter by George 111., in 1769, it
immediately disintegrated, and two groups,
known as the Society of Artists and the
Free Society, operated for many decades
successfully and independently. History
repeats itself in Australia. When the Royal
Art Society was created under Charter
by George’s successors, a similar disintegra-
tion occurred here, and the Society of
Artists broke away and is playing its own
hand. One necessary result of these
dissipated energies is that the official body
furnishes an exhibition less important in
quality than would otherwise have been the
case. The exhibits are 263 in number, 104
of them in oils, 133 in water colors, and 11
in black and white, with seven miniatures
and seven pieces of sculpture.
One notices that the best work is sent by
those artists who have put themselves in
touch with the whole of that modern Euro-
pean movement which stresses technique.
The best thing in the Galleries is Leist’s pic-
ture of a girl under a tree (“The Bridge,”
No. 78) ; but it is unlikely that he would
have painted it if he had never left Aus-
tralia, because the Australian galleries
would not have shown him typical examples
of ultra-moderns, such as John, Connard,
George Lambert and Orpen. In this pic-
ture Leist has succeeded in making the
paint a thing of life and freshness in itself,
and, moreover, he has captured air and sun-
light. The works of Rose Lowcay illus-
trate the point. She has the sense of color
and also a decorative sense which is per-
sonal. Her two pictures, “Quiet Evening”
(72) and “Poplars and Clouds” (104), are
pictures one could “live with,” and it seems
a pity that gifts of the sort- —which are
none too frequent, after all—should be strug-
gling to survive in difficult soil. In seem-
ing refutation of this proposition, and, as
an illustration of how much may be
“evolved from the inner consciousness,” is
the picture by Hans Heysen, “Sunshine and
Shower” (83).
The marine landscape is a form which
preponderates so heavily that it seems to
obsess the artists. The most important
thing of the kind is a sunlit cliff with waves
breaking to its feet. This is by Will Ash-
ton. It is admirable of its sort, and the
only thing to be said against it is that it is
a typical Royal Academy work —a criticism
which applies to other pictures in the
exhibition.
Apart from any question of the degree of
success achieved, the most encouraging
features of the show are the plucky attempts
which are being made by some of the artists
to attack the problems of portraiture and of
the nude. These, when all is said and done,
are, and always have been, the two real
problems in paint. Here it seems sad and
strange that a community of the wealth of
N. S. Wales has never managed to set aside
a couple of thousand pounds for the purchase
of a Renoir as an example of the nude, and
of some such great example of portraiture
as Augustus John’s “William Nicholson,”
In the absence of such things to act as
pacemakers, to show the miles to be traversed
and the goal to be reached, the Australian
is at a disadvantage. Paint, like litera-
ture, _is only a form of expression; and,
like literature, it depends on what has been
said by others for its existence as one of the
Arts. The Australian who is born with a
genius for the pen can buy the world’s
masterpieces for a few shillings in a book-
shop, but the Australian who is gifted or
cursed with a genius for the brush or the
palette-knife cannot do this. This gift, or
curse, which the poor chap, through no fault
of his own, is born with, is one of the most
precious things the community owns, if it
only knew it.
Re the anonymous letter written from St.
Brigid’s Retreat, Marrickville (N.S.W.), and
printed in The Bulletin (12/11./T4), this
paper is asked to say that neither the
Superior nor any member of the Passionist
Order, which occupies that monastery, was
responsible for it.
The British royal family is largely Ger-
man, and it has wide ramifications. Thus
there is a Duke of Cumberland (England),
and Teviotdale (Scotland), who is also Earl
of Armagh (Ireland), and a British prince,
and Duke of Brunswick-Luneberg . (Ger-
many ), ana a claimant to the throne of
Hanover (Germany), and a British super-
numerary general (which sounds like being
an honorary baggage waggon), also an Aus-
trian colonel. It is alleged that this person,
being now aged 69, went mad by reason of
the war, and wandered round in Danish terri-
tory, with pine-trees in his hair. Being cap-
tured and put into a lunatic asylum he pre-
sently recovered his wits —or at least as
many wits as the dispossessed son of a blind
and defeated father is likely to have when he
is aged 69, especially seeing that the
Prussians took not only his country but most
of his private fortune in 1866.

“Reginald Tippe” : When the war is over
various sorts of Empire-service will have to
be recognised. I think the time is already
ripe to suggest the institution of the Order
of the Blazing Ass. There will be Com-
panions of the Blazing Ass, and Knights of
the Blazing Ass, and they will all be loyal
men and women who have made idiotic
suggestions during the time of trouble. I
would be glad to personally recommend the
Blazing Ass who revealed himself when
arrangements were being made in a pleasant
North Sydney district for a garbage-removal
service. It was one of those small, overdue
sanitary undertakings which would have had
the full approval of the methodical Kitchener
had he been a resident. But the Blazing
Ass arose, and, choking with patriotic
emotion, said, “I don’t know how you can
discuss such matters as garbage while this
terrible war is going on!” I am writing
Kitchener by next mail to see if he sees any
reason why I shouldn’t buy a dustbin.
THE NEW MILITARY ENTHUSIASM.

Dougal McCosts, K.C., addresses the Court on 'behalf of the homiciae.
“Callan P.”: This War is essentially an
all-in affair. The Germans spray a forest
with petrol and when the Allies reach it set
the trees alight with a shell. The skipper
of the Emden approaches a British ship
under the Japanese flag. The Belgians de-
stroy thousands of Germans by opening
dykes and drowning them. These measures
should inspire those oversea Dominions
which have a priceler s possession of snakes.
The tiger and blac'. snakes of Australia:
the tic-polonga of Ceylon; the cobra and
deadly krait of India —these are reptiles
with international reputations. They are
easy to capture and transport, cheap to feed,
and in other respects well suited to a mili-
tary life. My idea is that __ the different
snake-producing dependencies * should raise
corps of snake-experts. In all cases where a
retreat was ordered the Snake Corps should
he given the place of honor in the extreme
rear and instructed to mine the abandoned
territory with unfed reptiles. All wine-
larders, pantries, meat-safes, vege-
table "gardens, fowl-houses, beds, couches,
sofas, etc., should be baited with
quick-springing vipers like death-adders,
whose khaki-lined hide renders them par-
ticularly valuable for work of this sort.
What more unnerving to troops, unused to
snakes of any sort, than to stumble into a
trench full of hooded cobras? Pythons and
even boa-constrictors might be profitably em-
ployed in the forest country around Argonne,
and Cambrai. Australian black
and brown snakes would acquit themselves
well in the marshes between Armen-
tieres and Dunkirk. However, the distribu-
tion of this arm could safely be left to those
in charge of it. The beauty of the scheme
lies in the fact that Germany can make no
response. All its snake-breeding colonies
are gone. It will be as defenceless as Ant-
werp was against the Fatherland’s new
siege guns. P.S.—There is the further possi-
bility of lowering bags of snakes into the
German lines from aeroplanes.
“Lexovien” : Once more the French are in
Alsace, and this time it looks like a per-
manency. If so, a day for which Paris has
been waiting draws near. For 44 years the
Arc de Triomphe. the crown of the finest
avenue in the world, has been kept inviolate.
During all this period no human being has
been permitted tp pass under it. It was
“vowed” to the .passage of the victorious
armies which were to give back Alsace-
Lorraine to France. Once, in its dreams,
the French nation passed under it; and the
man who headed the procession was Bou-
langer, the good-looking adventurer on the
black horse. But his nerve failed him, he
blew his brains out on the grave of the
woman he was unmarried to; and the dream
faded away. Since then the cavalcade has been
imagined in many shapes, but in none was it
foreseen in the form which it now seems
likely to take. Under the arch will pass
not only the soldiers of France, but those of
Britain. Australia, Canada, and so to the
ends of the earth. It may hot even be a
Frenchman at all who will lead the hosts;
if i,t is, it will presumably be the paunchy,
bullet-headed little Joffre. who is utterly
unlike the French ideal of * beau sabreur,
and who will not even be able to -mke a
decent speech at the close of the day’s
proceedings.
THE QUEST.
ELLA: “What are you looking for on the map, Fred? ”
FRED: “Atoms.”
ELLA : “ There's no such place!"
FRED : “Oh, yes there is. You know. The place where things get blown to. ”
The Sydney City Council has been dealing
with the Law of Prize. Its handling of
the matter suggests the hope that its next
efforts will be in some simpler branch, such
as murder, or insulting behavior. The
matter arose out of the damage done to the
City baths by the German steamer Elsass
when rushing out of Woolloomooloo Bay,
just before the declaration of war. The City
Solicitor wisely fried to put the brake on;
nevertheless the aldermen were that
some German should suffer, and, the Elsass
having escaped, a motion was earned ‘that
an application be made to the. Prize Court
for a lien on one of the captive ships till
the debt of £473 was paid.” Apart from
the fact that the sum specified is _ not a
“debt” at all, the Council’s theory is that
the most promising-looking alien enemy on
hand may be writted by the Council and
have a distraint put in on him because quite
another alien enemy has damaged the muni-
cipal wash-house. However, a lien would
not be applied for by any counsel in Ins
right mind, and if such a demented applica-
tion were made the Court would have no
power to grant it. Furthermore, the City
Council could never acquire possession in
any “captive ship” in any event, because it
is a body whose powers are strictly limited,
and its statute confers no powers upon the
aldermen to put to sea and capture slops.
The Bulletin gives this opinion in a
friendly spirit, and mainly in the hope that
writ-money may be saved and a fairly re-
spectable public body be presented from
making a further ass ..of itself.
* * * * *
The cables announce that the sculptor
Rod'in has given 20 of his masterpieces to
England in testimony of the latter’s work
for France. England once asked Rodin for
the loan of one of his works for an exhibi-
tion. Rodin, ever kindly, sent a plaster
cast. When it was unpacked before the
“hanging committee” a scene of distraction
ensued. As with many of Rodin’s works, it
was well over the odds from the English
point of view. It was impossible to affront
the great man by retvuming,it, 1 ,4t last some
bright spirit thought of the police;, Winei
street Station was rung uji, and an inspector
arrived. The inspector - "agreed to send a
formal-looking notification to the committee
forbidding the exhibition of the work. The
paper was sent to Rodfn, together with an
expression of the committee’s .regrets, and an
intimation that the ! cast was, being packed
for return. One of the attendants was told
to put it back in its case. -The packer got
a case, but the one he happened to get
wouldn’t accommodate the cast; so, languid
with beer, he sawed the legs off. London
never heard what Rodin thought of it, but
the gift of some £250,000 worth of his work
looks as if he had forgiven Britain.
“A. Subbubs” on the Passing of a Crisis:
I divide the war into three stages. The first
was a continual humiliation to all self-respecting
citizens anxious to preserve a reputation for aecuiacy
and wide information. Day after day fathers of
families were faced with the necessity of either
attempting to pronounce Nanteuil-le-handouin, La
Ferte-sous-Jouarre, Bar-le-Duc, Vitry-le-Francois, and
Bery-an-Buc, or of remaining ingloriously dumb while
the morning’s war-news was under discussion. The Ger-
mans were driven back from Paris and across the
Marne, and instantly the position grew easier. Simple
names became prominent, like Roye, Albert, Airas,
Lens, Ostend, Antwerp, Dunkirk and Calais. Nay, more ;
local housefathers had a certain amount of vague
information about them, as, for example, that
Antwerp was where the jewellers were; that Ostend
was the seaside resort which King Leopold patron-
ised with Cleo de Merode; that the word Calais was
engraved forever on Queen Mary’s heart. We are
now reaching the third stage. Under the resistless
impetus of the Czar’s plodding millions, the centre
of interest is shifting to Germany’s eastern and
Austria’s northern frontier. Who so inept as to
stumble over names such as : Lemberg, Cracow, Posen,
Lyck and Breslau ? And the farther the enemy falls
back the pleasanter must it be at our breakfast-
tables. Vienna (where the bands came from), Berlin
(admitting of arch references to persons “on the
Spree”), Munich (the birthplace of dark lager}, Dres-
den (china) —all these are as plain as Melbourne or
Manly. The French may lead the world in civilisa-
tion, but as regards town-names that are suitable for
colloquial use they are many years behind vandalistic
old Germany.
* * * i ■ -v*
“The Old Soldier”: The holocaust of
British officers still continues. Here is a
recent casualty list: — j
Officers. o(her Ranks.
Killed . . .. 73 273
Wounded . . . . 225 1,571
Missing .. .. 221 16,290
The commissioned officers of the British
army actually serving as combatants are
about 4 per cent, of the whole, and that
ought to be something like the ratio of
casualties among them. Actually the officers
killed have been 22 per cent.; the wounded
14 per cent.; and the missing only about one
per cent. .What is the explanation? We
know that the have specially
trained sharpshooters to-pick off the officers;
but how do they recognise them anyhow?
With the same drab uniforms as their <men,
and every badge of rank and honor laid
aside, they should be as anonymously secure
as a daily-paper letter writer. The British
officer’s passion for “smartness'” —compris-
ing such tilings as well-cut breeches and
shaven face,' a “waist” to his upper gar-
ments, and so on —may be one of the causes
of his appallingly frequent downfall. The
safest disguise in this war, other things
equal, would seem to be that of a sort of
military tramp.
GROWING GRIEF.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I grew a crop of roses rare
To take iny mind away
From things that sorrow breed, and care ;
I tended them eacli day ;
At night, with fingertips and nails,
I stripped them clean of slugs and snails.
My .prop of roses grew apace,
And nodded to the bees ;
I peered into each flower-face,
And on my hands and knees
Went round the garden sniffing scent
Till I was filled with sweet content.
But pirates came ir. iwos and threes,
Begged, stole and took away
My roses and my ecstasies,
By night as well as day.
Did I their thievings disallow
They called me with their eyes a cow!
' But 1 held on until a Face —-
A lying Face and mean—
Rose in an unexpected place
Behind the hedge of green,
And moaned at me. I heard it crave
My last lone rose to deck a grave!
I gave the lying ghoul the tree —
Buds, branches, clods and root !
With dusty hair he fled from me
And my avenging boots.
I will not grow large, gorgeous blooms
For hags’ bazaars and cadgers’ tombs !

“Mr. Ocky” : Geelong has been racketting
for many months over an effort by a
majority of the council to purchase and
transform into a city ball the old Grammar
School buildings. Ten councillors persisted
that the thing would be done, and the other
six vowed that they would die first, or words
to that effect. Hundreds of pounds were
spent in appeals to the law. Justice Hodges
said the six had no legal case. The Full
Court upheld him. So did the High Court.
With a whoop of joy, the 10 then let the
contract, but it had hardly been commenced
when the annual elections occurred. Three
of the 10 had to face the ratepayers, and
they were put out on their respective ears. So
now it is nine to seven the other way, and
there is a big chance that the scheme will be
wrecked, after all. Geelong would not have
had this trouble if it was governed by the
modern Local Government Act, which is
good enough for all Victoria except Mel-
bourne and Geelong. The useless and hoary
Corporation Act, under which Geelong works,
did not give the ratepayers the chance to
throw out the scheme (which means £25,000)
in the first place. Hence all the subsequent
expense and abrasion of aldermen’s ears.
* * * *
The Tower of London is a mouldy old
show place, with no guns worth mentioning
and walls that would hardly stand the
attack of an alligator. It was built by
William the Conqueror, and has seen very
little repair since. One big shell would
knock the relic to pieces. Still it has its
uses. A German spy was shot and buried
there last week. He refused to be blind-
folded, and simply sat in a chair and said
(in effect) “Let her go, Gallagher.” And
Gallagher did.
THE PERFECT
BUST.
SHE (reading medical advertisement): “A
perfect bust in ten days."
HE (reminiscently): had a perfect bust
once—and it cost me 14 days."
IN ICELAND.
Steamers returning from Copenhagen report that German war news is even being sent to Iceland. — Cable.
INDIGNANT ICELANDER: "Why didn't I receive my usual German victory this morning?”
NEWS AGENT: "There was no issue of war news yesterday. The Kaiser couldn't think
of any fresh armies to conquer.”
The course of true love seldom shoots
straight. So it happened last week at St.
Ivilda, Melbourne. William White, aged 49,
was kitchen aide at a hashery. It is a
humble, back-door job with no poetry about
it, and it doesn’t lead to greatness. In
fact, it only leads to the ash-barrel. Agatha
Stephens, aged 38, was cook or food-ruiner.
Neither was in the first flush and glory of
youth. The kitchen-man, having wasted
the treasures of love’s middle-aged dream on
the cook, naturally shot her, though with a
very poor aim. Then he shot himself and
died. The scullery Romeo and the frying-
pan Juliet take to tragedy on brief provoca-
tion. *
“Melb” : The new Presbyterian
Assembly Hall in Collins-street,
is really a fine addition to the
city’s architecture. Sixty years
ago there were here three Presby-
terian bodies fighting with each
other for the love of God. The
Establishment was represented
by Hetherington, at Scots’; the
Free denomination by Dr. Cairns,
at Chalmer’s; the so-called
United by Ramsay, at St.
Enoch’s, opposite Scots’. Chal-
mer’s Church was ultimately
bought by the R.C.’s, who pulled
it down and used its stones in
building a convent hard by. When
the three sects wisely conglomer-
ated St. Enoch’s was turned into
an Assembly Hall. But the
building wasn t good
enough for the site, so
the latter was leased to
the Taits for their
Auditorium, Which is
a great success. The
Presbyterians, thus
further strengthened
in cash, then decided
to build a new Assem-
bly Hall, and the site
of Scots’ Church par-
sonage was available.
A fine, solid mansion
this parsonage, but the
I clergy had left it long
since, and doctors had
made it blink with
their brass plates.
Hereon the new hall
is built to do credit to
the city and the sect.
Something unique in the way of an indus-
trial offence was considered by the N. S.
Wales Industrial Court lately, when a firm
of undertakers was charged with having em-
ployed only two men to carry a coffin con-
taining the body of an adult. The award
lays it down that not less than three lumpers
may be employed on this job. The defence
was that the chief undertaker had endeav-
ored to get another corpse-carrier at the
Union rooms, but, owing to extra-good
trade, he was unable to do so and the
vacancy went unfilled. It seemed a reason-
able excuse ; nevertheless he was fined. If he
had obtained a hand from the Coal Lumpers’
or Carcase Butchers’ Union he would have
been in trouble for employing a non-member
of the Remains’ Union, and if he had put
the deceased under the counter until union
labor of the right brand was available he
would have been served with a writ by the
Health Deoart-ment. So he had to man the
grave-ropes one short, and now the Law
compels him to drop the profits on the tran-
saction. And the citizen who caused all the
trouble by dying without first finding out
the state of the corpse-lumping labor market
isn’t even able to blush at his own most in-
considerate conduct.
* * * *
From “T. Souare” (who is a Frontiers-
man ) :
I don’t wish to be in any way offensive to “N’im-
porte,” who wrote about the Legion of Frontiersmen
(B. 5/11/’J4), but J would like to mention that he
is a liar. He says: “One thing the Legion didn’t do.
It didn’t volunteer to doff its pretty uniform and
join the drab khaki-covered men whose main idea is
fighting.” The facts are that one-third of the N. S.
Wales establishment (90-odd men) have joined the
Expeditionary Force. Practically the whole of M.L.’s
Legion is leaving for France. Queensland’s unfathered
mob are enlisting individually and being placed to-
gether in troops by a commander who knows their
worth. And so it is all over the Commonwealth.
“General Smuts passed the Legion the cold potato,”
according to “N’importe.” Certainly the South Afri-
can Minister for Defence refused the Legion’s offer of
service against the rebels, because, as be said, “be
had sufficient men on the spot” ; but he expressed the
highest appreciation, and didn’t suggest that the
Legionaires had offered to fight because they didn’t
want to fight
As regards the ornateness of the Legion’s uniform,
the answer is that that sort of uniform attracts
volunteers, and doesn’t interfere with the fighting
qualities of the men. Members of the Legion who
participate in the triumphal march of the Allies
through Berlin will find themselves surrounded by
Guards, Hussar and Lancer uniforms that will make
theirs look as drab as sackcloth.
* * * *
Little or nothing is heard now about the
extension of the railway through Sydney
and (per bridge) across the harbor. It is
one of the matters that the State Govern-
ment is pledged to, so in its usual feverish,
hysterical, kittenish manner it has dropped
the subject and fled away in pursuit of a
nice, fresh State wheat-growing idea. It is
the Ministry of Unfinished Enterprises.
Apparently the Private Enterprise Sydney
Ferries Co. is now quite confident that no
bridge is coming to compete with it, for,
after pushing up its fares by as much as
one-third, it proceeds to reduce its services,
and cut down the facilities it offers to its
infuriated supporters.
* * * *
“Hamer”: Croakers to the contrary, the
old kindly feeling between master and man
still retains the spark of vitality. Take the
case of the handy-man emoloyed at a Mel-
bourne hash pagoda. He had been mourn-
fully told by the boss that business was
slacking away disastrously, and that the
staff would have to be reduced. Did the
handy-man use embittered words to the effect
that the boss was making up the few
pounds he had put into the patriotic funds
by sacking some of his struggling wage-
slaves? Never! Seizing a revolver he
promptly shot the cook and then committed
suicide. No staff could be more promptly,
cheerfully and definitely reduced^
* * * *
Judge Murray, sitting as a N.S.W. Marine
Court Judge, has staggered an ancient insti-
tution. The little coasting ketch Rozelle was
bound north from Sydney when the main-
mast carried away. The skipper repaired
things, and was returning to Sydney when
the wind chopped round, and the Rozelle
went on a lee-shore owing to the damaged
rigging failing in its duty. In accordance
with precedent an attempt was made to
penalise the old salt in charge. But Murray
wouldn’t listen. Said he :
Rather than censure the master the Court would
prefer to comment upon the conduct of people who
trade on the coast with craft which cannot by any
possibility hold their own under fairly adverse cir-
cumstances.
When the news went round, the Coffin-Ship
Owners’ Union went oh strike for the day,
and remarked gloomily that things were going
to the Devil.
* * * *
An interesting item of the local edition of
the war was the arrival in Port Jackson on
November 11 of the four-masted German
barque Ernst, with a full general cargo. The
ship left Hamburg on July 18, and reached
port in ignorance that William, the Redskin
of Europe, had gone scalp-hunting. Through-
out the long voyage the Ernst spoke only
three vessels, and not one was friendly enough
to mention what was doing. More strange
than all, not one hostile cruiser saw the prize,
whose experience shows up vividly the extent
of the bounding ocean wastes, and the track-
less deserts of the deep, and so on.
“Trotter”: Most of the people who talk
about Armageddon seem to have the idea
that there’s no such place. They are wrong:
the ecstatic writer of the Apocalypse took a
real field for the final battle with which this
weary old mud-ball is to be wound up.
Armageddon—more properly liar Megiddo—
the plain of Esdraelon, is called Megiddo in
profane history and the Old Testament. The
superb view from the Hill of Nazareth takes
in the plain to the south, with the Jerusalem
road dawdling through it. This plain was
the cockpit of Asia, even as Belgium is the
NEIGHBURLY AMENIIIES.
STOUT PERSON: “I feel proud, ma'am, that
my brave husband has gone to the front.”
UNPLEASANT NEIGHBOR: "Indeed. I was
only saying to my husband this morning
what a blessed opportunity this war has
given some men to desert their wives.”
European cockpit; and the Apocalyptic writer
merely adopted for his “Armageddon” the
battlefield of centuries before him. Here
fought Jews, Egyptians, Babylonians,
Syrians, Phoenicians, Arabians, Macedonians,
Romans and Crusaders. Indeed, the scraps
went on till the artillery of the French,
under Bonaparte, and the English and Turks,
under Sidney Smith, was audible from Acre,
which is on its fringe. Nowadays a sweeter,
more peaceful locality cannot be imagined.
The plain is broken only by the hills called
Little Hermon and Gilboa. Far north are
the eternal snows of Hermon proper and
eastward the green, rounded summit of
Tabor.
RUSHING THE GOOD WORK.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
Motor cycles are extensively used by clergymen
going here and there in large and scattered parishes.
—Church news.
The vicar splutters madly past;
I see the curate's coat-tails flashing;
And so, like any cyclone blast,
The Church upon its way goes dashing,
Plain mud and petrol perfume splashing
On those who stand aside and stare
At Holy Orders wildly bumping,
And over ruts and gutters jumping
Upon the Lord’s work here and there.
The crouching curate scoots ahead ;
The vicar roars along like thunder;
’Tis certain they would be found dead
If one should make the slightest blunder.
A crash, two shrieks; and Something under
A mass of steel would moan “Beware!”
To folk with intellects still level—
“ Beware of going like the Dev-il
Upon the Lord’s work here and there.”

“Master Cargo”: Bougainville (Solomons)

round the funeral pyre. With the corpse are burned
the household gods, some food, and, .in the ease of a

“Silas”: “Jug” Ryan had been fighting
with “Micko” Quinn in a small - caboose over a
sporting greengrocery in Fitzroy (Melb.), and “Jug”
had been put out with a vicious right cross to the
chin in round seven. They tried hard to revive
Mr. Ryan by slopping Yan Yean on his collar-bone,
patting his hands, and using kind and conciliatory
words; but he declined to come round, so he was
bundled into a cab, and taken to the hospital, where
a young doctor got the battery to work on him.
“Jug” stiffened under this, sat up, blinked his eyes,
then swung right and left at the nearest head. The
next 10 minutes were employed in restoring the
young doctor to animation. “ ’Strpth ’n’ s’help me,”
protested Mr. Ryan, “I thought it was ‘Micko.’ ”
“G.H.J.” : Out at one of the N.T. buffalo-
shooting camps we had a few bottles of the non-
reftllable brand. One of the lads, for a joke, gave a
dead marine to a nig. to fill with water. Jaeky
made for the creek close by, and dipping the bottle
held it there for a few minutes. When he lifted it
he looked surprised to find it still empty, and down
it went again. No use. He tried blowing down the
bottle to shift what was in the way, and at length
gave it up as a bad job. Disgusted, he returned to
the crowd. “I think more better gibbit key alonga

the beer-keeper; “no ’ope of gifting it done to-day.
The Sydney papers came up this morning.” “Well?”
I asked. “Well, y’ see, ’e reads the war news,”
was the reply. I didn’t believe the yarn and went
along to the smith, who, sure enough, was reclining
in the midst of a heap of newspapers. When I
requested him to get busy, he seemed annoyed.
“ ’Struth,” he said, “look at all them” (pointing to
the pile of papers), “I haven’t well looked at
them yet.”
“1t.J.8.” : Arthur Brewer’s mention of the
Nebine (B. 22/10/’l4) impels me to remark that
more than one bore would be necessary to make
that arid furrow a running stream for its full
length. Cursed by drovers and travellers of all
sorts, its barren, stony course winds down over the
N.S.W. border to the Culgoa River, which is a
Mississippi by comparison. The only thing I ever
noticed worth looking at twice along the Nebine
was a record family of baby emus. The old lady
had no less than 16 encumbrances.

B. Mayne”: Until quite recently it was
a fairly common thing in the far northern river-
districts of Queensland for binghis to organise a
“hunt” and induce the mothers of any half-breeds
in camp to join 'the party. Leaving a few old hags,
old men and the infants, off would go the crowd.
During its absence the half-caste nippers were
butchered and made up into “joints.” The hunters
generally brought back with them nothing but an
appetite. And they didn’t have that long.
* * * #
“Mimosa”: Has any abo.-scientist yet
identified the fish that are emitted alive from bore-
holes at a heat temperature that would encourage a
crab to change its color? Those I have examined in
AVestern Queensland are not young “yellow bellies”
(which they slightly resemble), but are identical with
the fish I have oft-times seen dug from 6ft.
below the surface of the Sahara. Trace these sub-
terranean fish to the place they hail from, and the
scurce of our artesian water supply would no longer
be in doubt.
* * * *
Hay”: Long ago I came to the conclu-
sion that a hunted emu’s pace for a s’'ort distance
is often well up to 10 miles an hour.
I once had a sprint after half a dozen
full-grown birds and headed them
into an angle formed by a deep West-
of-Darling creek and a new six-wire
sheep-proof fence. My horse was
fairly fast and the flock went at a
rattling pace towards the point where
the fence ran into the creek. There
it was that I hoped to see the manner
in which an emu behaved in water.
I had no speedometer with me, but
I know we were doing good time.
After about 2.1 miles the birds had
nevertheless gained ground to the ex-
tent of 200 yards, and for a few
seconds I lost sight of them on account
of the creek bank being 15 or 16 feet
above the water. When I arrived I
saw six very wet emus making tracks
up the opposite bank and still going
strong. The creek was about 100
yards wide, and, from soundings taken,
30ft. deep in the middle. I don’t
know how they crossed, but they
couldn’t have had time to throw a pontoon bridge
over the liquor.
* * * *
The drought having now partially cracked,
various reverends who had respectfully asked Provi-
dence to alter its arrangements will doubtless take
credit to themselves. In connection with nrayers
fop moisture, a serious member of the flock recently
addressed this flattering but awkward query to his
favorite pastor: “Will God send rain in direct
answer to prayer, or did He in the beginning con-
struct everything on a natural law that is fixed and
unchangeable?” The reverend did not make the
obvious reply that he had never seen the plans of
Creation; he sparred for wind in the best clerical
manner, and then wound up sonorously: “I can see
no reason why I may not legitimately ask God for
rain, provided my request is accompanied with a
sincere recognition of the truth that He knows
better than I whether the request should be granted
or refused.” It is understood that there is great
joy among the angels at his frank confession on the
part of an American preacher that God knows best
They never quite realised how really great Cod was
till the Yankee missionary placed Him first.

This from a Maoriland paper hands one to
brother Bill:—
PUBLIC NOTICE. —The Marriage of Miss Amv
Ditfort and Robert MacLachlan was celebrated in
St. Saviours Church on the 26th inst., without in-
curring any Debts in the name of William C. Ditfort
and without his assistance.
‘‘Pick”: The Monaro tableland (N.S.W.),
with its grassy plains, unfailing springs and full-
oving rivers fed from the snow-capped roof-ridge
o the continent, is regularly the salvation of the
Near West when drought spreads itself over the dry
, >e ' U !. lng P ast two months, trucks to carry
a a million starving sheep have been requisitioned,
and the very inadequate Cooma line has been
trenziedly struggling to shift along the endless loads
of mutton. At the ter-
minus we have had to
burn hundreds of
corpses, the weak stock
being unable to stand
the rough truck hand-
ling ; but the survivors
are right for food and
water among the hos-
pitable highlands. This
same Monaro, which in
many drought-striken
times has similarly
provided its surplus
fodder to the starving
flocks of the Near West,
is the region which
Sydney back-yarders,
during the capital site
cheat, described as a
blizzard-swept, unin-
habitable desert.
A .OTHER SCANDAL.
’ENERY (heroically): " Yes! You can put on yer Jin e hairs and fewers jist ’cos Bill's
gone to the war. But let me tell you there's jist as good fish in the sea as was
ever caught!"
“Poe”: The horse is a noble animal until
hs gets a bullet well into him. Then he becomes a
mere cumbersome mass of dead meat; and if he
happens to be one of a moving gun-team, the proces-
sion has to be held up until he is cut free. The
motor is also a noble animal, with the added
advantages of a metallic hide and a higher speed.
If it is hit it doesn’t scream and kick, and there
is no necessity for a funeral if it is killed quite
dead. The British War Office, with these facts in
mind, carried out some artillery haulage tests a
couple of months ago. Ordinary touring cars, with
a field gun apiece hitched on, were found to be equal
to an average speed of 21 miles an hour. The dis-
tance covered in four hours would have occupied
three days if horses had been used. Yet, despite all
such discoveries, the old four-legged contrivance
comes in very handy for cavalry purposes, and so
forth. Too handy, in fact, for his own comfort. It
will be a happy day for him when he is chased off
the field as if he were a dog on a racecourse.
“Pickhandle”: Re inquiries as to totals
of sheep shorn on Australian stations. Burrawong,
near Condobolin (N.S.W.), on the Lachlan, put
through 250,000 sheep with 80 shearers. Bach in
the ’Bo’s as many as 300,000 were turned out there
in one year, with 101 shearers. The station ran
back from the river some 30 to 35 miles and had
a water frontage of 45 miles.
“Te Babarantiko” : While it is true that
the Pleasant and Ascension islanders (I presume that
Nauru and Ponope are meant) keep frigate birds in
captivity, as alleged by “Lagani-Namo” (B.
29/10/’l4), the same applies to all Micronesia. The
birds do not breed there, but on the Central Pacific
Sporades, a vast area that begins some 600 miles
east of the Gilbert Group and stretches along both
sides of the Equator half-way to South America.
These reefed sandbanks are all alike——a few inches
higher than the highest spring-tides. Stunted, coarse
grass and a little saltwort is the only vegetation.
The islanders to whom the birds immigrate snare
them, keep them for a while on a perch and feed
them on fish. When liberated the guests rarely fail
to return.

The hot wind drinks all moisture as it goes,
The garden boasts but remnants of a rose—
A brown and crinkled and dejected thing
Like some stale autumn fancying it is spring.
Red ants are hurrying from the glittering sand,
Grey dust makes powder for a wrinkled land,
The long wire fences shimmer on the lea—
Slips from the fingers of pale Phantasy

The painted masterpiece of the mirage.
My dog lies by the skillion. He has found
A dole of shade upon a thirsty ground ;
His sides heave, and, the scampering ants among,
Drips the saliva from his lolling tongue.

“Milreis” : When the compulsory notifica-
tion of syphilis becomes law, will the N.T. share in
the benefits? Medical men say that nearly all of the
gins are affected with venereal disease. As fully 70
per cent, of the white men and 90 per cent, of the
Chinese cohabit with lubras, there will be a nice
bill for Australia to face some day. At present
what few laws there are are broken with impunity.
Let me quote a case. A man came up from South,
and, pigging with gins, begat half-caste youngsters.
In time he discarded the blacks to marry a white
girl. She died in child-birth, and the baby with
her. “Blood-poisoning!” said the doctor. We knew.
The man got a fresh lot of grins and half-caste
youngsters, and discarded them to marry another
white girl, by whom he has had several children.
The man, to all outward seeming, shows no sign
whatever of the complaint, but every one of the
children is seriously cursed with it. There are men
to-day who openly boast of having murdered their
half-caste children, because they were diseased.
Combos will pay any possible price for a clean gin,
because of their awful superstition that if they can
bo the first to “break her in” they will cure them-
selves by passing the disease on to her. So children
only eight or 10 years of age are bought by these
brutes and outraged. And the law is motionless. If
such a case ever comes before the court, the first
question asked by the accused’s counsel is “Where
is the birthrcertificate to prove this girl under age?”
and the case falls through. Wherefore I say to the
people in the seats of the law-makers: “What about
it?”
THE KAISER'S AGENT.
It is reported from Berlin that a scheme
has been formulated to foment trouble with the
Australian aboriginals. Baron Von Slink
arrives at a lonely spot in the North and pro-
ceeds to read to King Billy an address (which
is customary) from Kaiser Billy; and while
King Billy and his consort do the honors Gar-
rabee, the Butcher , proceeds to do the needful.
If the Kaiser is persistent in this project he
will get all the trouble he wants.
IMAGINARY AFFLUENCE.
FIRST DOSSER: “ Well , Bill, 'ere's another thousand a year , old feller."
“Meitana” : I know something of the cal-
lousness to the sufferings of animals shown by
natives of the South Sea islands. When living at
Tanna, New Hebrides, I saw a turtle carried from a
beach chief to a bush chief, through the territory
of a closer-in bush chief. The payment for the
turtle was a huge pig, and to assure that it would
be eaten and that no nahak (sorcery) would be made,
its lower jaw was broken in two places. When the
carriers arrived with the animal at my place (which
was within the boundaries of the mid-way chief’s
land) he claimed the pig on the ground that the
turtle, which was given for it, should have been his
by right of custom. His demand being met with
studied insult, he refused to allow the caravan to
proceed. The poor pig was dumped down in the
sun about 50 yards from my house, and flies were
soon feasting on its jaws. Remonstrance was un-
heeded, and I was warned in a friendly way that
to interfere would be dangerous. The pig lived for
two days. I have seen fowls held by the legs and
thrust in the fire to singe off the feathers; then a
gentle tap on the head has partially stunned them,
after which disembowelment, etc., has proceeded. A
very common thing is to find a small bird fastened
by a broken leg to a string which is whirled round
by the little devil who has trapped it. Is it cruelty
or an extreme ignorance of pain ? I have seen awful
sights at circumcisions and fighting. In one case a
man was shot in the head, the ball entering the right
eye and coming out again just above the right ear.
I saw this wound cleaned with bruised leaves, in
exactly the way one would clean the chimney of a
lamp. And no concern was shown by either the
patient (who was more or less conscious) or the
operator. The most remarkable part of it was that
the patient recovered.
“Klifton” : Here’s another libel. The Com-
mander-in-Chief took up a position with the object
of determining for himself just how the soldiers
behave towards sentries, and whether the troops
seriously recognise the position as regards pickets.
Presently the tramp of approaching foosfeps
was heard. “Halt! Who goes there?’’ demanded
the Chief. “Scots Greys!” came the clear reply.
“Pass on, Scots Greys!” ordered the Chief. More
footsteps. “Halt! Who goes there?” “Grenadier
Guards,” answered a respectful voice. “Pass on,
Grenadier Guards!” Then, in the darkness, the
steps of some more soldiers. “Halt! Who goes
there,” exclaimed the Chief. “Mind your own
business!” came’ the reply. “Pass on, Australians,”
ordered the Chief.
THERE ARE NO BONES IN BEER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Bryng us in no befe, for ther is many bonys; but
bryng us in good ale, for that goth downe at onys.
—Old English saying.
“Life is mostly froth and bubble” —those are words

Poets quote them in their frenzy when obsessed by
beer!
He’s a dreary euss who tags on: “Two things stand
like stone —
Kindness in another’s trouble, courage in your own.”
“Life is mostly froth and bubble” —when Life’s sane
and gay.
If your moral teeth are tender, throw • Grief’s steak
away.
Push the beef of Trouble from you, keep your palate
clear.
Old, deep-drinking England found there were no bones
in beer.
“Bring us in no beef, for there is many bones ; but
bring
Ale that goeth down at once.” Hurrah ! God save
the King!
As Old England roars its challenge, wowsers sink in
fear.
You will find no bones in beer, lads! No dashed
bones in beer!

Mick Morrissey’s Jealous
Nature.

WEEMIN’S a sore thrial t’ man

Flynn philosophically, “’n’ yeh

Mick Morrissey was narvis ’n’ irritable wid
weemin more than orthinry, consequint ’twas
the fate iv the poor big man t’ be alwuz
mixed up ’n’ most consarned along iv the
dauthers iv the tribe.
“A gr-reat ’n’ inthusiastic lover iv weemin
was Morrissey, ’n’ wan most immotional ’n’
electhric did a-nother man iv anny pritin-
sions occupy space in his vicinity whin he
was walkin’ himself out wid a lady iv the
opposite sex. ’Twas more’n enough did the
inthrusive sthranger cast a thrillin’ eye side-

Inshtantly Mick was up, hoppin’ high, a vic-
tim iv prickly heat, shparks in his wishkers,
’n’ fire sthrikin’ frim the very teeth iv him,
wantin’ t’ ingage in mor-rtal combat widout

“Wan _ noiglit, bein’ sthruck wid the

‘Has annyone a strait weskit?’ sez he.
“ ’Twas not till five po-lice raced up the

THE TOWER OF BABEL.
There seemed to be a concurrence of opinion with a suggestion from Mr. Cook, that the capital work ought to be wholly reorganised, and a plan settled,
on which work would steadily proceed. The existing system was muddling. Everybody who spoke admitted as much—admitted, too, that nothing satisfactory
would ever be accomplished until a sufficiently strong man got hold of the matter, and entirely rearranged it.—Parliamentary report.

Ex-Treasurer Simpson Newland, of Adel-
aide, whose “Paving the Way” has gone
into five editions, not counting the de luxe,
has started on his 80tli year. Simpson re-
tired from squatting on the Upper Darling
a generation ago after having made a pile.
He came from England in 1839 with his
father, a Congregational minister, who
brought out a party of immigrants and
settled at Encounter Bay. The opening
chapters of “Paving the Way” take you
back to the old whaling days down in that
district where the ships of Flinders and
Baudin met in peaceful encounter more than
a hundred years ago. From the bay Simp-
son once rode through the unbeaten bush to
his station on the Upper Darling, 700 miles
or more. His mount was the Star, the noble
steed that plays so conspicuous a part in
the novel.
ATTORNEY-GENERAL HALL (N.S.W.)
listening to questions in the House.
Charles Thomas Benzoni, who died re-
cently in Wellington (M.L.), aged 81, was
a Crimean campaigner. After getting
through the unpleasantness with the Bear,
he turned to the Dragon and accompanied
Lord Elgin’s expedition to China. He was
at the bombardment of Canton and the tak-
ing of the Taku forts. Canada he found too
tame, so he butted into the war against the
Maoris. Fed up at last, he settled down
into a Government billet, where, gentle soul,
he was frequently mistaken for the Founder
of the Peace Society.
The escape of the Goeben and Breslau from
the Mediterranean fleet has been a horrible
misfortune for two well-known people. Rear-
Admiral Troubridge, who was relieved of his
command and court-mfirtialled (a cable of
last week mentions his acquittal), is a
sort of relative of the G.-G. before
last. Lady Troubridge (the wife of
his elder brother, who is a baronet and a
London stockbroker) is a sister of Lady
Dudley. A Troubridge was one of Nelson’s
admirals, and the family has been in the
navy ever since. Sir Berkeley Milne, an-
other Admiral to be relieved, has always
been about three-parts courtier to one part
sailor. He was in command of the King’s
yacht in Edward Vll.’s day, and is still a
power at Court. An aspiring U.S. hostess,
who was busy blazing a social track for
herself in London, was mad enough to
slight him once. It got to the ears of
Queen Alexandra, with the result that she
cut the distracted Yankee lady dead.
She never recovered from the blow, and
returned to Ulysses (Pa.), or wherever it
was, and resumed her old habits of gum-
chewing and high teas. The recall of
Troubridge and Milne is, by the way, a
sign of [he times. Neither Kitchener, at
the War Office, nor Churchill, at the Ad-
miralty, has any time for the social touch.

HOLMAN : “Dunno what folks will say to this

The best description of the defence and
capture of Lihge has been written for publi-
cation in England by Dr. Paul Hamelius,
Professor of English at the University of
Li&ge, who was an eye-witness. Mrs.
Hamelius, who was also in the city when
the lesson in German was being given, was
Dora Wilcox, a well-known Maoriland
writer and a frequent contributor of verse
to The Bulletin.
P. T. Heggaton, Chairman of S. Austra-
lia’s energetic Standing Committee on Rail-
ways, is retiring from politics, at any rate
for the present. His district, Alexandra,
has lost a member, and Heggaton, though
pretty sure of re-election, has voluntarily re-
tired so that his three colleagues may get
back. Heggaton’s contributions to Hansard
this session are very few ; he has addressed
the House but twice. But when he does
talk both sides listen to him with respect.
Of the world’s most daring sculptor:—
The cable mentions that Rodin has given England
a full score of his statues in recognition of its help
to France. How great a man Auguste Rodin is you
may judge from what Belloc said of his “John the
Baptist’’—“a great event in the world’s history, like
some decisive battle.” Of Australian cities only
Melbourne has a sample of his work.
By birth he is a peasant, and his wife is a peasant
woman; and though their wealth, nowadays, is great
it does not interest either of them. In fact, Mrs.
Rodin still labors in the fields.
His first great work was “L’Homme au Nez Oasse,”
produced in 1864, when he was a workman in the
studio of Carrier-Belleuse. He had not then taught
people to see, and it was laughed at, with the rest of
his output, for nearly 40 years.
Personally a most interesting man. He has the
thick, stocky figure of the laborer; his head is
enormous ; his eyes have that quality of “largeness”
which is supposed to be characteristic of great men;
his hands are small and beautifully modelled. In a
low, clear voice he talks freely of his work, but with
no egotism. In comparing Greek and Italian marbles
this was a characteristic dictum: “The marbles of
Carrara are moonlight, but Greek marble is the sun
itself.”
J. J. Calvert, Clerk of the N. S. Wales
Parliament, has taken 12 months’ leave of
absence prior to retirement. At 85, and
after 61 years of Government service, he is
the sole survivor of those who were con-
nected with the first Parliament under
Responsible Government (1856).
Died last week, John Smith, a Custom
House agent in Sydney for as long as there
has been a Custom House. Blindness afflicted
him, but, for long years, didn’t daunt him. A
stranger watching him perambulate unaided
round the barn-like Custom House would
never have suspected that he did his business
by ear. He was something extra in John
Smiths.
Dr. Ramsay Smith, of Adelaide, who takes
command of the Field Hospital with the
Australian Expeditionary Force, has had any
number of volunteers —topnotchers in the
medical profession—to accompany him to the
front. Walter Henderson, of the South Aus.
Hansard staff, lias been chosen as secre-
tary. Henderson is a fine French scholar,
and will come in handy as a translator and
interpreter.
Val Cole, who is opposing Farthing for
East Melbourne in the Vic. State elections,
is a son of E. W. Cole, of the Book Arcade.
It is his first serious political canter,
although he was on the exercise track under
Essendon Liberal colors when Willy Watt
ducked, but he did not get as far as the starter.
Pa Cole lias practically retired from his
haunt in Bdurke-street. Occasionally, how-
ever, the old-gentleman (he is well over 80)
may be seen wandering round, leaning on the
arm of his poet-manager, Williams.
J. L. Stirling, pastoralist, politician and
polo player, of South Aus., a brother of the
eminent Professor E. C. Stirling, F.R.S., was
65 on November 9. He has never missed a
sitting of the House since he was elected
President of the Leg. Council in succession
to the late Richard Chaffey Baker, more
than 13 years ago. Other men in other
Parliaments equally as devoted to public
duty are sometimes obliged to stay at home
on account of illness. But Lancelot Stirling
doesn’t get ill —the result, he says, of his
participation in field sports. As a young
man at Cambridge he laid a solid athletic
foundation; he won for his University the
amateur championship of England in the
Hurdle Race of 1870 and 1872. Incidentally,
lie also romped through in Arts and Laws.
James Penn Boucaut, S. Australia’s ex-
Judge and the last of the State’s nensioners,
lately had his 83rd birthday. The veteran
sat on the Supreme Court Bench for nearly
30 years. After throwing off the gown, nine
years ago, he filled in time by writing vigor-
ous letters on topical subjects. Finally he
had to abandon this pleasant form of mental
exercise, and for some time his health has
been breaking up and he is now extremely
feeble. Chief Justice Way, who stepped up
to the Bench in 1876, two years before
Boucaut, is still going strong. In his 79th
year Way is by length of service the oldest
Judge in harness in George’s overseas
dominions. Boucaut’s hobby was Arab
horses ; Way’s has been sheep.
“E.L.C.W.”: The wife of W. Pember
Reeves, formerly of Maoriland, deserves at-
tention when the brains of the family are
being mentioned. Ever since the Fabian
Society formulated its socialist anti-frontal
tactics she has been a leading member. Mrs.
Reeves is one of the sweetest-looking women
who ever spoke from a platform, but was
the hardest nut Lloyd George had to crack
when he was getting his made-in-Germany
Insurance Bill through the House. As the
moving spirit of the Women Fabians she
stumped the country before the Bill was
discussed in the Commons, and, as a result
of the spirited attack she led, the Bill’s
worst injustices to women were removed
before the measure reached the Statute
Book. It was in collecting ammunition for
this campaign that Mrs. Reeves got the
material for the book she has since published
“Round About a Pound a Week.”
The German press agrees that the captain
of the Emden is the most commanding figure
that Germany has evolved since the war
began. Well, perhaps he is. Von Moltke’s
military reputation blew up at an early
stage. At latest advices the Kaiser had
deposed him and taken over his job. Von
Kluck is said to have infuriated the Berlin
war-experts. The Crown Prince has messed
things up utterly in the Argonne region.
And the Kaiser has done nothing notable
except cruise about France and Belgium in
an armor-plated red-cross conveyance, and
urge Lis troops to take untakable positions,
regardless of loss -of life. The skipper of
the Emden’s claim to fame rests on the
fact that he is the one prominent German
commander who does not radiate an atmo-
sphere of futility. He didn’t attempt much,
but whatever he did attempt he accomplished
-—until he bumped the impossible in the
shape of the Sydney. If he ever returns to
Germany he. will be the most popular figure
nation has known since the Captain
of Koepenick—the humble wit who made a
fool of the army and all its pomp and glory
twice running.
It is a coincidence that Sir Edward G . »
the official who has rendered the F>b ot
correspondent a hollow mockery, should h
self be a direct descendant of the first wai
correspondent. An ancestor left the only
reliable story of the Battle of Bannockburn.
The Sir Edward Grey of that time had been
made prisoner by the Scotch, and w r a.s m
their camp on parole. He was thus m a
position to watch the whole disturbance, ana
history is the richer as a result.
FEDERAL
POST-
MASTER-
GENERAL
SPENCE.
From the Gallery :
The latest pressman appointed by the Holman
lavishment, J. W. Niesigh, is to act as publicity man
to the luxurious department at San Francisco which
conceals the guileless ex-Minister Nielsen (at £4 4s.
a day and exes.) and a few more. Niesigh was lifted
from, a sub-editorial chair in Sydney Sun. He has
had a varied experience, both with the pen and the
sword, in Australia and South Africa. When Hutton
was in this country as Commandant he reckoned
Niesigh the best secretary he ever had. N. S. Wales
is to pay him £720 a year. He’s worth it, if only
to take some of the burden off the over-worked
Nielsen.
Captain Glossop, of the Sydney, is one of
the last men you would suspect of blowing a
battleship, to pieces and consigning many of
its inhabitants to the tomb. To look at him
and hear him talk you could not picture him
ill-using a worm. He is small and slight
and gentle, and the possessor of a soft voice,
a large, thin nose, and a benevolent eye.
He has been on and off the Australian sta-
tion for over a quarter of a century, and is
popular in every big club in the Common-
wealth.
Whiter Gilbey, Bart., the dry-gin man, died
last week. Starting in a small way in Bor-
deaux, he wound up as a millionaire. Be-
sides dry gin he specialised in prize cattle
and Shire horses, and was a bosom pal of
Edward A r II. In appearance he resembled a
buck of the Regency brought up to date, or
some antique boulevardier Anglicised for rural
purposes. He got the last ounce out of life,
and. in a vicarious way, is sure of immor-
tality, as his portrait by the late W. Q.
Orchardson is held to be one of the classic
examples of English portraiture, its only
parallel in modern times being Sargent’s
picture of Lord Ribblesdale.
The cable mentions that Queen Alexandra
was at the memorial service to Colonel Gor-
don Wilson, of Victoria, so old “Salmon”
Wilson’s son has presumably been slain in
France. He went into the Blues after leav-
ing Eton, and did well in S’Africa. He
married Lady Sarah Churchill, an aunt of
the present Duke of Marlborough, in 1891.
She was with him in Mafeking, and,
after making herself a fairly compre-
hensive nuisance to the authorities,
ended by being captured by the Boers.
Family influence was a big factor
in those days, and negotiations were
begun to have her released. The Boers
cutely declined to exchange her for anyone
but Ben Viljoen, one of their sturdiest
fighters, and the man who was credited by
Winston Churchill in the Morning I’offe
with “the finest feat of arms of the war.
Viljoen was given up ultimately, and Lady
Sarah was despatched to Capetown, fol-
lowed by the maledictions of every soldier in
S’Africa who happened to be out of society.
THE WAREHOUSEMAN'S REVENGE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A well-known business man has returned to Aus-
tralia. He has been imprisoned by Germans tor 10
days. “There is little more to say,” remarked Mr.
Softgoods this morning. “They did everything to
humiliate us. How they do hate the British! I
am finished with Germans. Lord help the first Ger-
man that comes into my warehouse!”
—lmpressive news item.
John Henry Raggs from wild Berlin
Came back with ev’ry hair on end ;
When war broke out (it was a sin)
No German called John Henry friend;
They simply shoved him in _a train,
And told him to go home again.
John Henry Raggs did not enlist
When to his country he returned ;
He kept away from war’s red mist,
Though for revenge he sighed and burned.
Said he, ’neath high shelves rising sheer:
“God help the first that comes in here I”
“God help the first that Comes In Here I”
And, saying, raised one hand on high ;
Wild was his rage and flushed his ear,
Like one prepared to do or die.
Then, like a trick with care contrived
That instant One of Them arrived !. .. .
Did John Raggs blench or falter? No!
To his own self John Raggs was true;
With level gaze he faced the foe
And growled: “What can I do for you?"
He added “Sir!” with hissing breath,-
And waited, still as socks —or death.
“Ties vor mine neck,” the Teuton growled.
Did John Raggs make one with his fists,
And curse his victim as he howled,
And choked, and squirmed and bit John’s
wrists ?
Lord, no! With glittering, snakish eyes,
John sold him two most rotten ties I

The WILD CAT
COLUMN
N.S.W. Treasurer' Holman made the usual
mess of things over his loan negotiations with
the Commonwealth Government, in associa-
tion with the other States. It was agreed
between the parties that the States should
individually keep off the market; yet within
a few days of the Conference it transpired
that N. S. Wales was raising money locally.
Then, of course, there was a row, and very
pointed hints of bad faith. As a matter of
fact, there wasn’t so much a want of faith
as a want of frankness. At least a week
before the Conference, this N.S.W. loan of a
quarter of a million was offered to likely big
. investors in Sydney and Adelaide: and there
would have been no trouble about it had the
N.S.W. Treasurer stated the facts to the
Conference. Adelaide took about £40,000 and
Sydney about £170,000. At that noint the
Government’s brokers appear to have been
called off, in consequence of the outcry.
To pay off short-dated Treasury bills fall-
ing due at the end of the month, the N.S.W.
Government has just raised another
£1,500,000 in London at 4;] p.c. The accom-
modation is of the most temporary character.
The transaction merely postpones the trouble
till the middle of next year. For the present
John Bull has a lot of short-call money that
he doesn’t know what to do with: hence the
remarkably low quotation of 14 p.c. for short
loans. The bulk of this money is, as a rule,
used for Stock Exchange carry-over pur-
poses ; but the London Stock Exchange is
still closed, and there is no sign of a re-
opening, so that avenue of employment is
shut.

There you have a smaller premium- income,
a higher loss rate and a higher expense rate.
In fact, the percentage of underwriting
profit is the poorest in the table. What
Maoriland called its drought during a part
of the year is partly responsible, and
the Australian drought can’t have done the
co. any good either. Then came the war.
filling the last two months of the co.’s year
with gloom, knocking out the marine busi-
ness, and more or less disorganising the fire
business. These things explain all the un-
pleasant movements noted in the figures.
Consider now how the National of New
Zealand stands from the point of view of (1)
the policy-holder, (2) the shareholder. (1)
I’aid capital and reserves combined total
£477.573. This is more than six times the
amount of last year’s losses; and last year’s
losses, as mentioned already, were unusually
heavy. Next year the co., provided it could
realise its assets at book value, could meet
losses 74 times greater than it has been
asked to meet hitherto in even its most ex-
pensive year. This is a position of most
uncommon strength. Whether it could
speedily realise its securities at book value
is another matter; for of assets aggregating
£512,474. no less than £326.351 is in mort-
gages, and another £97,000 is in unspecified
debentures. The co. could meet the worst
conceivable catastrophe if it had . time. Its
only weakness would be exposed if a sudden
demand were made upon it. But even that
demand would have to be far greater than
ever has been made upon it. (2) As to
shareholders, their position, to start with, is
that they are liable for £900.000. The shares
are £5, paid up to only 10s. Why share-
holders haven’t relieved themselves of some
of their liability by capitalising reserves
from time to time isn’t obvious. The effect
of that perfectly legitimate operation would
also be to reduce the rate of dividend : and
25 p.c. is calculated to provoke assaults.
Besides, it is misleading, inasmuch as share-
holders own £3 15s. of reserves for every £1
of the capital on which the div. is computed.
With reserves so strong it is not absolutely
necessary to make large additions in bad
times ; therefore the present dividend may be
safely continued even if profits temporarily
shrink another £lO,OOO. Though provision
ought to be made for contingencies, it is de-
sirable when a co. has put itself in a strong
position at the expense of dividends in good
times, that it should stand by shareholders
as far as possible in bad times. It is, of
course, impossible to tell from a balance-
sheet what losses, if any, this eo. is likely to
make on its securities. A lot may depend
on whether the co. can afford to nurse them.
Provided no great catastroohe calls suddenly
for money to pay vast claims, the co. should
have no need to force anything on to the
market. It had on September 30 about
£79,000 in cash, and its unpaid claims, etc.,
amounted to £19,900,' so the current year
would have to be more than twice as disas-
trous as usual to consume the cash —includ-
ing, of course, what will be received this year
in premiums.

There is a margin there of £13.180: but that
isn’t necessarily surplus profit. Deprecia-
tion of mines, plant and other assets is
provided for by writing down those assets out
of undisclosed profit; in other words, a cer-
tain amount of revenue, not treated as
profit, is set aside to replace plant or refund
the capital represented by the wasting mine.
The visible reserves, while they are thus not,
so far as one can judge, ordinary deprecia-
tion or replacement funds, are nevertheless
insurance funds. The directors at any rate
say: “The co.’s fleet of steamers runs unin-
sured, and the co. carries considerable fire
risks of a selected character, as well as the
risks of the Workmen’s Compensation Act.”
In the past year £12,000 (included with the
profits shown in the table) was added net
to the reserve funds. “The premiums
earned on such risks,” the directors add,
“provide the major portion of these alloca-
tions.” It is arguable whether in these cir-
cumstances the £12,000 ought to be shown
as profit. But if the fund has benefited by
12 months’ premiums, either this or some
other fund has had to stand the racket of
12 months’ claims; and the co. is then
£12,000 to the good. So the amount can
stand as a profit. What sum is written off
for depreciation of mine, etc., isn’t men-
tioned. Still this mav help us to a guess :

Liquid assets . . 55,183 131,375 154,598 173,864
Since 1910 no new capital has been got in.
Nevertheless the net liquid assets have
grown by £31,814, the semi-liquid assets by
about £6000; and important additions have
been made to the co.’s fleet and the mine
equipment—the latter now as good as any in
Australia. In the past year, besides paying
the dividend and adding something to the
stores, £17.307 has been put by after paying
for considerable additions to the mine plant.
But, while the dividend has been easily
earned, there isn’t the old hope of bonuses, of
course. For years the capital was £175,000,
and bonuses simply had to be scattered to
use up the profit after paying a reasonable
dividend on that little lot. Since then, how-
ever, £175,000 of bonus capital has been
issued and £50,000 was called up at par, so
that an 8§ p.c. dividend now mops up as
much as a 20 p.c. dividend used to.
The war will no doubt affect this co. more
or less. But, in spite of certain restric-
tions, the coal business is brisk. The Bel-
lambi does a lot of bunkering. This trade
will, be affected by the dislocation of the
foreign shipping business; but the consump-
tion of coal by troopships will be some set-
off against the losses through the partial
stoppage of metal and wool exports. It may
prefer to dip its dividend for the current year.
But if it wants to maintain it where it is,
no Australian coal co. is in a better position
to do it.

You needn’t believe those figures if you
don’t want to. David Fell is the skipper of
this concern, and he isn’t the sort of finan-
cier who would willingly approve of the
payment of a dividend in excess of the real
profits five terms out of ten. and in the other
five of a distribution that allowed a total of
only £156 being put to reserves. It is
therefore possible that profits have
been greater, and that part of them
has been written off ostensibly against
depreciation. But you merely have to
guess that. On the published accounts
the position is very uncomfortable—and
very discreditable into the bargain. It is
very uncomfortable for this reason. In 1905.
when the co. had £42,240 in cash and public
securities, the net profit for the 12 months
was £5649. For the past year, with only
£lO in cash and no public securities or bank
deposits at all —in other words, with the
liquid assets converted into ships and other
things not so gilt-edged as the old securities
—the 12 months’ net profit has been only
£5780. In other words, the profit is practi-
cally no more than it was 10 years ago
notwithstanding the accumulation of re-
serves, visible or invisible, and notwithstand-
ing that more than half the capital 10 years
ago was held liquid, whereas now it is all
in assets whose value is much more likely
to be eaten by the cockroach. No doubt
the profits as disclosed nowadays may be
much under what the directors might fairly
declare. But why they should go on year
after year putting themselves in a false
position by cutting down the profits so loav
that the dividend they pay is unjustified—
in other words, why they should persistently
reflect seriously upon their own reputations
for prudence—this paper doesn’t know. It
really looks as though the business is less
profitable than it was, taking the security
into consideration; and the only thing that
can be said in explanation or exten-
uation is that payments have of recent
years been made on account of new
ships, which have not: of course earned
money while they were on the stocks.
These new ships may change the aspect of
things. Apart from that it isn’t pleasant
to note from the accounts: Cl) that the
declared value of the assets is less now than
it Avas 10 years ago; (2) that, so far from
there being any margin of profits, or pro-
spects of increased dividends, the present
dividend Inis not been earned. As for the
increased div. for the half-year ended March.
.1914, what really, happened then Avas that
a i p.e. bonus Avas paid instead of the co.
paying shareholders’ income tax.

The P. and L. account makes the profit for
the half-year £40,734; but £2O has dropped
into one reserve fund and £3O has fallen out
of another, and the net result is to cut £lO
off the half-year’s figures. The bad slump
in the copper market is mainly responsible
for the poorer showing—that and the recent
piling up of copper which has been taken
credit for at only £5O per ton. Ordinarily
at the end of a half-year the co. has weil
under 1000 tons of unsold metal on hand.
Of the 3864 tons produced last half-year onlv
147 tons were sold before the war broke out
at the end of July: the sales made before
then had been of the previous half-year’s out-
put. After the Avar started the co. sold 1400
tons at an average of £52 18s., as against
£66 11s. 4d. realised in the co.’s previous six
months. At September 30 there were thus
2317 tons on hand. Of this 750 tons have
since been sold at £52; but of course that
can’t show in the accounts. So far as they
arc concerned, of the half-year’s output of
3864 tons, 1547 tons were Avorth £52 18s.
and 2317 tons were worth onlv £5O. The
latter figure is £l6 11s. 4d. less than the aver-
age for the previous half-year. And £l6 on
3800 tons means £60,800. Allowing for the
couple of pounds more that Avas realised in
the early part for the 1547 tons it L plain
that the metal market. Avent against the co.
to the extent of £55,000 during the half-
year. Keeping that in mind, the profit for
the term was amazingly good.
Fortunately North Lyell has responded to
the cal] upon it. For the previous half-year
the copper content of the North’s ore sent
to the furnaces Avas 5.96 p.c. For the past
half-year it Avas 6.05 p.c. Compared with
the position 10 years ago this is how values
stand: —

North Lyell has. moreover, developed so
splendidly that a far greater proportion of its
ore is now available for smelting; for every
100 tons of Lyell ore 64 tons of North ore
are now furnaced. This change accounts, by
the way, for some of the increase in costs.
The latter are still, however, distinctly mod-
erate —10s 3d. for mining, 9s. 2d. for smelt-
ing and Is. 9d. for converting. Total per

A previous table gave the half-year’s metal
values. What is left is. it is estimated, of
a grade at least as good as that worked in
the six months. Last half-year’s extraction
was 104,993 tons from Lyell and 65,604 tons
from the North. This is nearly nine years’
supply at the recent rate of extraction; and
the estimate might safely be made more
liberal on the strength of recent develop-
ments. But the price—who knows? Only
this can be said : there is no industrial metal
in more immediate demand than copper.
The consumption in warfare is very large ;
and when the metal is used it is gone mostly
for good—it doesn’t come back to the melting
pot again, as so much copper does. That
is the cheerful point of view for the stock-
holder in copper mines. The less cheerful
factor is that, since many of the largest
copper mines are gold-producers also, the pro-
duction of copper is maintained, being made
possible by the gold for which an instant
market can be got. So copoer is being piled
up ; and, even if the industrial demand should
be good immediately after the war, it will
take some time to use up stocks. And that
means low 7 prices for, possibly, a few years
to come.

the spelter market plays. These are the

The profit shown for any half-year is, how-
ever, not entirely governed by the average
price in that term. This co. buys so-called
tailings from the Broken Hill mining cos.,
and works them primarily for their zinc con-
tents. It doesn’t produce metallic zinc
(spelter), but merely makes a preliminary
separation of the zinc, lead, silver and gan-
gne. Its own products consist of two kinds
of concentrates, one and by far the more
important carrying about 49 p.c. zinc, and
burdened with 6 p.c. lead and Boz. silver;
the other assaying 53 p.c. lead and 350 z. to
550 z. silver, and burdened with anything up
to 18 p.c. zinc. These products are sold
to European smelters; and final settlements
are not made until long after delivery.
Ordinarily the seller is paid on the aver-
age price in the six months succeeding de-
livery. Thus the co. first assumes a figure
and takes credit for its output on that basis.
In the next half-year, supposing prices have
gone up, the profits are inflated by the sur-
plus actually payable on the previous half-
year’s deliveries. For the period June-Dee.,
1913, the price assumed for spelter was £2l
per ton. Last half-year the average was
£2l 7s. 9d.. so that 7s. 9d. per ton on the
previous half-year’s deliveries was added to
the past half-year’s profits. For the past
half-year the deliveries w 7 ere taken credit for
at £23. The metal markets shut up at the
end of July, and there were no official
quotations until last week. To make
a settlement it was agreed to regard £22
as the average price; and for the current
half-year the co.’s profits wall benefit to the
extent of about £lO,OOO on last half-year’s
deliveries.
The directors don’t say whether they had
any anxiety about getting payment. It may
have been significant that, whereas at June.
1913, the co.’s “sundry debtors” owed
only £36,647, at the end of the past half-
year the amount uncollected was £59,156.
Further, the dividend declared payable in
August was rescinded, so that shareholders
have had nothing since May. Lately very
little has been done at the works, and tiil
the end of the war profits are going to be
very small. The Broken Hill mining cos.
may produce their silver and lead, and thus
more or less keep the pot boiling. This co.’s
dependence is almost wholly on spelter; and,
while Australia has done very little indeed
in distilling spelter, Britain has allowed the
Continent to practically collar the European
trade. The business may be diverted in
time ; but it will be a long time. You can’t
Put spelter works up in a day, or a month.
Least of all can you get together in a hurry

tudinous retorts of a big works.

The Barrier never took the recent “Com-
mission on the Mining Industry at Broken
Hill” seriously: there were no more disputed
points than usual, and nobody clamored for
it. Naturally, as a rep. of each side sat
with B. R. Wise, the chairman, few of the
recommendations are unanimous. The only
things of consequence they all agree to are
that no person suffering from tubercular
disease should be allowed to work under-
ground ; that the men should be medically
examined every six months; and that lead
poisoning and its sequelae should be an
“accident” under the Miners’ Accident Relief
Fund Act—-which addition isn’t of much
consequence nowadays, though it would
have been tremendously important when the
cos. were working carbonates. The Commis-
sion doesn’t know whether Broken Hill
miners are particularly liable to pneumonia,
and recommends that somebody else should
find out. Regulations as to air purity are
recommended, and a majority (the chairman
and the bosses’ rep.) agreed that no man
should be required to work more than a six-
hour shift in places where the thermometer
I wet bulb) registers more than S2° Fahr.
With the men’s rep. the chairman agreed
that in contracts a minimum of wages should
be guaranteed a party. But this isn’t of
very much importance either, because if a
job is turning out badly the men simply pull
out.

In pursuance of what appears to be its
policy to be only a holding co., Howard
Smith, Ltd., has floated the Australian Sugar
Co. The capital is £85,000, and the co.
starts off with about £16,000 of reserves
represented by surplus assets. Howard
Smith’s, of course, retain a controlling inter-
est. The property consists of sugar lands
and a mill at Mourilyan. It is proposed to
spend £20.000 on increasing the mill’s
capacity to 80,000 tons of cane per season.
Encouraged by the prospect of making tin-
plates at Newcastle when the B. 11. Prop.’s
iron and steel works start next year, Mel-
bourne people have in hand a project to build
a tin-smelter alongside the coal. It isn’t
proposed to do anything on a big scale; but
enough concentrates are shipped to Singa-
pore and Europe to keep a modest outfit em-
ployed so long as the tin market behaves
moderately well.
* * * *
C.S.A., Cobar, faced the Warden a little
while ago and asked for suspension of labor
conditions. Application refused. Appar-
ently the co. thought the Warden was only
joking, because it immediately had a second
try. Application again refused. No labor
has, however, been put on, but an application
has been made to the District Court. Before
this can be heard the co. may be asked if it
can show any genuine reason why its bases
should not be cancelled. The trouble is that
the co. has money; and until that is used
up the Department doesn’t see why it should
stop.
* * * *
Great Cobar asked for suspension of labor
conditions the other day on its Chesney and
Cobar Gold Mine leases. To man the leases
144 people are required, and the co. can’t
run that and also keep the Great Cobar
properties unwatered (this alone costs £l5OO
a month). Pellew Harvey, a director, has
been inspecting, and is to arrive back in
England about the end of the month. He
will at once place his report before the
debenture holders, who are now the people
to decide on future operations. Hogan
Taylor, in giving evidence, said that, with
copper at £52 10s. a ton, the co. could just
about pull through; but he could not be
prevailed upon to state how much was
required to place the properties in working
order. Laird, late manager at Chesney, who
arrived here from Mexico in Bellinger’s
time, has been engaged examining his late
charge, no doubt furnishing a still further
report to someone or other who cannot yet
realise that matters are as bad as they
appear. Three tribute parties are engaged
on the co.’s Peak property. One party has
had a small crushing which went over an
ounce.
At last Westralia is going to wipe out
the disgrace of having no miners’ insurance
fund. The arrangement tentatively made
is that a Board with a Government nominee
as chairman shall control a fund, to which
employers and employees will subscribe equal
amounts and the State a subsidy, just as in
N. S. Wales. It is estimated that the Board
will have about £25,000 a year to start with.
Sick pay, it is calculated, will be 255. per
week, with ss. for each dependent child.
Provision is made for the benefits of the
fund to be extended to incapacitated miners
who have been employed in the industry
within the last two years, as well as actual
contributing workers. A recommendation
is made that in future all applicants for
work on the mines shall be examined as to
their physical fitness. The acceptance of
the scheme now rests with the men them-
selves. If they are wise they will jump at it.
* * * *
Westralia’s gold production continues on
the down grade. Last month’s output was
10,000 oz. less than for the corresponding
term in 1913, while that for the 10 months
was some 36,0000 z. short. “Wise and stimu-
lating assistance” is suggested as the one
thing needful to send the yield up again.
What is really wanted is a handful of new
mines to take the place of those dying out.
Great Fingall has thrown up its option
on the Big Bell leases near Cue (W.A.).
Inability to raise the wind in London is
alleged to be the reason.
Next to nothing in the shape of develop-
ment is now being done in the bottom of
the Great Boulder (W.A.), but by-and-bye
it is intended to bore from one of the ad-
joining mines—probably the Horseshoe —to
see what the Boulder main ore channel is
like at a depth of 3000-odd feet. Meantime
a thorough search for additional payable ore
is being made in the higher levels and old
stopes with considerable success. The co.’s
Stawell (Vic.) options are being drained
now to 1200 ft.
Golden Butterfly (W.A.) says it doesn’t
want a new plant to treat the dense sul-
phide ore which has been struck at depth,
and generally infers that things are better
than is alleged. People on the spot do not
agree with this, and the market seems to be
of the same opinion. As emphasised here
some time ago, the co. may go on treating
ore for some time to come, but unless a big
enrichment occurs there will be no real
profit in the work.
* * * -X-
Corinthian North (W.A.), which had a
prospectus average of 30s. to 405., is now
crushin g 15s. sd. ore. Even this is said to
be yielding a profit; but what has become of
the other stuff? The co. lately incurred
heavy expenditure in the purchase of new
plant to treat the sulphide, which seems to
indicate that it at any rate believes the mine
to be better deeper down than it is up above.
Commodore (W.A.) weighed out light
last month. It got close on £lOOO over the
plates, but when it had finished paying out
there was a deficit of £4O. There seems to
bo something about this concern that re-
quires explanation. Its dividend-paying pos-
sibilities are frequently boomed, and nearly
every other progress report records values
much above the milling average. The co.
claims to have an asset of several thousands
in its residue dumps, but if the mine is
anywhere near as good as its barrackers
say, it ought to be doing better and have a
good deal besides this. Its market record
for the past year or two has been a rise of a
shilling or two, a call, then a knock-out, and
after a short lapse the same thing over again.
One creditable thing about Westons
(W.A.) is the quiet, steady way in which
it is being opened up. Practically no specu-
lative pegging is being done, the mine-boss
and his promoter-pal are not to be seen pan-
ning off rich prospects obtained from else-
where and indulging in other dishonest
pranks, and no interested boomsters are run-
ning round trying to make the public lose its
head. Edna May scrip has certainly soared
to a dizzy height, but that is the result of
developments at depth, increasing revenue and
profits, and whispers of ss. or (is. a month
in divs. Although of comparatively short
length, the shoot in the mine is the best that
has been opened up in the' State for years.
How far it will go down it is impossible to
say. Many quartz mines go wrong at or
above 400 ft., and most of them snuff out
before 800 ft. is reached. Very few have
lasted to 400 ft. in the West. There are now
three mills at Westons—the Edna May’s,
Edna May Central’s and Greenfinch’s. The
last-named is chiefly employed in crushing
for the public, as granite cut off the shoot in
the co.’s own mine at a shallow depth.

Lake View and Oroya showed a profit of
£76,225 for the year ended June 30. and the
£22,351 left over from the previous 12 months
made a total of £98,576. Two 5 per cent,
divs. absorbed £36,095, and an interim div.
of 5 per cent, has since been paid absorbing
£18,047. Two of co.’s chief interests, the
Zinc and Burma Corporations, were said to
be turning out well, while the profit on the
Queen of the Hills at Meekatharra was more
than sufficient to pay 5 per cent, on the
issued capital of the co. On the other hand,
the Yuanmi was a bit off color. When the
year closed, co. had a large assortment of
debentures and pref. shares whose par value
was as follows: Central American .Mines,
£35,000; General Petroleum Co., £48.100;
Granville Mining Co., £36,675; Gt. Fitz-
roy. £12,036; Zinc Corporation. £20.940;
Hydraulic Power Co.. £4OOO. It also owned
the Queen of the Hills mine and Brixworth
Ironstone Co., and among others had these
ordinary shares: Amalgamated Zinc, 2400;
Babiloma Mines, 150,007; Block 10, 5700;
Burma Corporation, 100,000; Central Ameri-
can Mines. 159,824: Granville Mining
•>1,420; Lake View and Star, 622,749; Moun-
ts) 1 Queen, 243,008; Nagrom Syndicate,

169,036; Zinc Corporation, 51,100.

During October Gympie crushed 12.545
q?*aa * or 4SlBoz. Scottish Gympie handled
8600 tons, and its revenue from stone and
tailings amounted to £BB7B. No. 3 Columbia
has been crushing lower grade stone. It
has earned a spell, for it has given share-
holders 2s. per share in a few months, which
ish t a bad record for so low priced a stock.
Ihere are 20 head of stampers employed
full time. The October return was 857 tons
for 411 oz. lOdwt, smelted gold. No. 1
Columbia reports colors of coai’se gold in a
rise 20ft. over the old stopes (1250 ft.
level). But this isn’t likely to save it from
calls, as it has been on poor stone for some
time.
* * * *
Brilliant, Charters Towers, is feeling the
pinch of hard times, and both its mines
(Brilliant and Stockholm) are in the hands
of tributors. During the last 14 years
£1,398,000 worth of gold has been produced
and £680,416 paid in dividends; but nowa-
days little mines on the outskirts of the field
are more highly esteemed. Southern specu-
lators have reason to remember that the
dazzling old records of neighboring mines
caused an insane boom in Deeps. The latter
hasn’t, however, come within cooee of a divi-
dend, and its returns have shrunk to an
average of about 645. per ton. The only
sera]) of comfort is that 15 heads are now
crushing instead of 10, so possibly costs are
down a trifle. The whole field for the first
10 months of this year made calls to the
tune of £20.609. while dividends amounted
to only £3578. The Papuan announces a 3d.
dividend, yet the stock is worth only Is. 4d.
“Billy Blue”: Apropos of the first load
of coal out of Newcastle (B. 5/11/’l4).
The first ship to go to the Hunter River
and load for a foreign port was the Anna
Josepha, a brig of 370 tons, mounting two
guns, and having a crew of 31, commanded
by Captain Hugh Meehan. She formerly
had been a Spanish ship, but was taken a
prize by the Betsy (a whaler having letters
of marque) off the coast of Peru, and
brought to Sydney in 1799. with a cargo
consisting of flour, sugar and spirits. A
Vice-Admiralty Court was held in Sydney
and the ship and cargo were condemned and
sold. The ship was purchased bv Simeon
Lord and Captain Hugh Meehan, and her
name changed to Anna Josepha, after the
wife of Governor King. Early in 1803 she
was employed bringing down coal, which her
owners bartered with the captain of the Earl
Cornwallis for merchandise, the mineral
being valued at £3 a ton. In September of the
same year she w r as sent to the Hunter and
loaded with 100 tons of coal and 4000 ft. of
timber and returned to Sydney; after being
victualled she sailed for the Cape of Good
Hope on October 26, where ship and cargo
were sold. The Earl Cornwallis about the
same time took a cargo of coal to Bengal,
but her loading had been brought to
Sydney from the Hunter by the Anna
Josepha and Francis. She sailed on October
4, 1801, commanded by Captain James Ten-
nant. These two shipments formed the
genesis of Newcastle’s great export trade.
In July, 3801. King issued regulations for
the Hunter River, by which he charged ss.
a ton royalty for coal exported and 2s. 6d.
a ton for coal used in the colony.
Things are not going well at Mount Jasper
(Tas.) ; there appear to be internal rows,
and the retirement of manager Miller, for-
merly of Long Tunnel, is talked of. Share-
holders ought to get him in front of them
first: they would probably learn a thing or
two.
4f- * * *
T. J. Whaley, an American who has been
drilling for oil and working oil all his life,
thinks so highly of the prospects in the south-
east of S. Aus. that he has secured 30,000
acres of land, mostly freehold, in the neigh-
borhood of Kingston; and he has search
licenses covering other territory. The plant
he brought in. after securing the ground, wall
go down to 4000 ft., and he left orders for two
more drilling outfits. It is said that Whaley
is working mostly with his own money.
Anyway, there is no local company behind
him; and the idea that the Standard or any
other monopolists are interested is repudi-
ated with much emphasis.

The rebel Maritz’s commando has its head-
quarters at Bloemhof, which is the newest
get-rich-quick spot in South Africa. Its
surface diamond diggings, on the banks of the
Yaal, topped the records as regards out-
put of gems two years ago. The diamond-
iferous land being town commonage the one-
man outfit got a chance. From being a dead
Dutch dorp, with one pub, a store or two. a
railway station and a population of 300.
Bloemhof leapt to nearly 30.000. Also, other
things jumped, including nrices. There
were no sensational finds, but a number of
fairly big ones at frequent intervals; and as
river stones always fetch a bigger price than
others —48s. 3d., as compared with the de
Beers’ average of 245. sd. per carat —the
field has been kept steadily at work. The
only other place in S’Africa where diamonds
have been washed from surface deposits in
recent years— r as a commercial proposition, of
course—-is at Luderitzbueht. in German
territory.
“Mainshaft” : Hugh Mahon, Assistant-Min-
ister of External Affairs, has made an error
very unusual to his level head in believing the
“experts’ ” reports that “zinc production has
not been established on a large scale in
Great Britain, owing to the fact that it was
impossible to get labor cheap enough.” On
this evidence, without "fiscal considerations
entering into his mind,” Mahon said “he did
not intend to take any action to recommend
either bonus or duty.” He “reasoned that
no bonus Parliament would be likely to
make would be large enough to make up for
the difference between European wages and
Australian.” And he was right, although
the idea that England is not a low-wage
country like Belgium and Germany is wrong.
The Germans and the Belgians won the
trade, not by cheap labor, but by brains
and methods which the English were too
slow to imitate. Ilence for years past
Britain’s part in the smelti g of Australian
concentrates has been the supply of Cardiff
coal to German and Belgian smelters.
Methods are everything; and once Tasmania
has the Great Lake harness d for cheap
power and electrolytic smelting, Australia
can establish its spelter industry at Hobart
and pay the high wage which Australians
demand without hurting itself.

A
WOMAN’S
LETTER
Sydney, November 16, 1914.
My Dear Arini, —
Admiral King-Hall was mentioned as a
possible successor to the Macgregor as Gov-
ernor of Bananaland. The Northern State
intimated that it would like an Admiral —
possibly with a canny notion of having an
eminent naval authority on the premises to
advise about the impossibility of making
Rockhampton a real port. However, appar-
ently there was no naval man to spare; so
the North is to get a Major instead —Goold-
Adams, major and knight. The new man,
w T ho married a Canadian, has of late been
doing various small governing jobs in
Cyprus and South Africa ; but soldiering in
wild places has been his real work.
The Munro Ferguson, during his hurried
stay in Sydney, put up with the Strick-
lands. Incidentally, he denies the rumor
that he cabled for Dick Nevill. He says
he knows nothing of the report that the
former chamberlain was asked to return to
Federal Government House. It is impos-
sible to put a bit and bridle on the jade
Rumor, whether it bolts across 500 miles or
five paces in these stirring times.
Lieutenant-Commander Pope, R.N., the
recently-promoted navigation officer on
H.M.A.S. Sydney, took the Berrima to
Papuan waters. When he returned he
was given a comfortable billet on
Garden Island. He wasn’t looking for
office-chair ease while so much was doing
elsewhere. The Sydney (no one dared to
mention it at the time) happened to be
•here. The wife of the navigating officer was
dangerously ill, and Pope clamored to go in
his place. He got his way at the last
minute, and had just time to climb aboard
without packing up all his kit. Now, no
doubt, he is hugging himself for joy at his
luck.
Lady Liverpool, wife of his Ex. of Maori-
land, has just lost her brother, the Hon.
Charles Monck, in the way that is now so
common that it needn’t be specified. Charles
was a captain in the Coldstream Guards, and
was due for quick promotion, having greatly
distinguished himself in the retreat from
Mons.
The Australian working man’s wife whose
husband has been thrown out of a job by the
war is living under a strip of calico, pro-
vided for her by the Government, at Botany.
Professional musicians are strolling the
streets playing for a crust outdoors, because
it is difficult to find it indoors. Plain citi-
zens are practising all kinds of minor acts
of self-denial to keep on the right side of the
ledger, while giving their little bit to the
bottomless pit of patriotic funds. There’s
nothing to bemoan about in this when we
remember the sorrows of Belgium. But
when we call to mind the hero-worship which
is lavished on enemy prisoners in our
midst, it is another matter.
Governor Strickland gave an impressive
midday snack to welcome the Colonial In-
stitute secretary, Mr. ,T. R. Boose. This
wanderer, who was previously here, was in
South Africa before he again came our way.
I forget for the moment what Mr. Boose’s
exact mission was. He left England before
the Teutons pulled on their war-boots. It
was something concerning the crimson thread
of kinship, which is now working overtime
at pyjamas and soldiers’ comforts. Aus-
tralia’s great lawyer, Samuel Griffith, one
of the guests at this meal, has the evergreen
habit of flowing anecdote. The other morn
he was in his best form, and delighted his
neighbors at the board with his vim as a con-
versationalist. He has had a good many
birthdays, and is still as tough as nails.
G.-G. Munro Ferguson is booked to spend
five weeks in Government House, Brisbane,
with Excellency Helen and the usual re
tainers. He jumped into the breach between
the departed Macgregor and the just-
appointed Major Goold-Adams.
The Strickland household, with the Kin-
dergarten and the nursemaids and the dolls’
houses and the incubators, has been trans-
ferred safely to the airy homestead at Hill
View.
The Royal Art Society’s “private view” on
a sweltering afternoon kept a stream of visi-
tors on the move. President Lister-Lister
can’t sub-edit the weather. If he could he
would alter the luck that dogs the society
year after year, and asphyxiates its guests
when they have climbed up to the top of
Vickery’s Chambers. Justice Heydon, who
grows younger with the flight of time; a
selection from tne Francis Suttor family,
who bolted out of the building with a par-
boiled expression; hon. treasurer G. W. Had-
field, who toys with Art when he isn’t at
work on bank accounts; the learned Louisa
Macdonald, M.A. (the Women’s College lady-
boss) ; Mrs. Woodhouse and Miss Maud
Thompson perspired gently on the threshold
of Rubens and Rembrandt and Murillo and
Velasquez. Even John Lane Mullins, in
spite of his devotion to Art, fled early in the
afternoon.
“Andromeda,” by J. S. Watkins, was the
coolest-looking lady present. She is fair, fat
and beefy, and is depicted placidly staring at
her wall of rock by the cool seashore. An-
other type of damsel, mauve-garbed and
dainty, appeals to the feminine notion of
what the summer girl ought to look like. J.
R. Jackson, who calls his painting "On a
Bright Day,” has sketched a really pretty
damsel—a thing few artists condescend to
do. Mrs. Emily Paul says that to see the
best English scenery you must go to Wales.
To prove her words she has flung a lovely
little bit of North Welsh scenery on half a
yard or so of canvas.
Captain A. W. Onslow, of the Camden
Park clan, and a brother of the local poli-
tician, has fallen with his head to the enemy.
No man can do more just now. Excellency
Helen, now in Brisbane, poised en route at
the Onslows’ country mansion. There are
four brothers, but only one sister in this
family, which inherited the fortune founded
by pioneer John Macarthur, of wool fame.
Australia’s popular ex-G.-G. Denman has
been given the command of the Reserve Regi-
ment of the Ist Middlesex Yeomanry. The
good “sport” saw service in the South Afri-
can row, and was so badly wounded that he
had a narrow escape of being left amongst
the dead.
Kipling’s star seemed to sink into an
ordinary horn-lantern after he had pelted it
with bis verses about “muddied oafs” and
“flannelled fools.” It is curious to note how
little he has to say now about the part the
British sporting man is taking in the big
tussle with the enemy. Every leading golfer,
tennis player, cross-country rider and polo-
player of any note has volunteered for the
front. Australians are often twitted with
their devotion to sport, but they are going to
give as fine an account of themselves as Rud-
yard’s “muddied oafs” on the other side. By
the way, Captain Burnham, the tall Help in
the Denman mdnage, who played .such a
rattling game at polo and tennis, is men-
tioned in a recent list of wounded.
The way the hospitals are suffering owing
to the war and the foolish system of leaving
them dependent upon the philanthropy of
chance subscribers is illustrated by the
anxious appeal which is being made on
behalf of the Royal Alexandra Hospital for
Children (Sydney). On November 20, receiv-
ing boxes will gape throughout the city for a
trifle, and nobody will feel the worse for
refraining from one afternoon visit to .bar
or tea-room and dropping the sixpence into
the stream that carries health childward.
The wife of Baronet Cooper has been push-
ing the scheme forward.
Chief Railway Commissioner John Harper
and his wife invited their friends to sip tea
with their one unmarried daughter at the
Australia one afternoon last week. Miss
Harper’s marriage with Mr. Louis Berkle-
man was fixed for Thursday of this week.
But a conference calls the Commissioner to
Melbourne just then, so the very quiet
family affair was dragged forward a couple
of days.
The English nursemaid is said to be so
enamored of the glory that now sheds its
halo on the man in khaki that she refuses
to go out walking with any other uniform.
A few of the regiments which are still
tricked out in gaudy colors are clamoring
for a change to mustard-colored clothes, in
consequence of the coldness with which Mary
Jane regards the once all-conquering red
coat.
Rhoda Wager, the Scotch girl who is now
a leading Arts and Crafts member, has the
best show of art jewellery the Society can
put up just now. The recent exhibition of
crafts’ work in Norwich Chambers, a small
side-line to catch the buyer who is already
stalking Christmas presents, included speci-
mens of Rhoda’s unique way with pearl
blisters. I suppose the blister is the con-
gealed tear of a very depressed oyster which
has lost its mother. Anyhow it sobs itself to
sleep with great success in filigree silver.
A New York paper which has printed a
good deal of feminine verse now launches
the protest of Edith M. Thomas. This
very minor poetess follows the heavy tread
of Ella Wheeler Wilcox, and implores the
men of every nation to “be not mobilised.”
The American lady, who is in no danger of
having her farm burnt over her head or of
seeing her aged relatives hanged on the
rafters, bids the male person to stand firm
and turn the other ear to the smiter. She
says: “Stand in your fields, your shops, and
do not go! Be ye not ‘mobilised,’ but stand
like stones.” The rest of it will be read
aloud at the next International meeting of
the Peace Society.
The late Mr. W. J. Clunies Boss, who
passed out at Ashfield the other day, was an
early buttress of the cause of technical edu-
cation in N. S. Wales. His wife, a slender,
delicate-featured lady, with a soft voice, be-
longs to the clever Tilley family. Mrs. Martin
Donohoe is a sister. Professor Tilley, who
founded the Tilley Institute for Languages
in Berlin, is a brother of Mrs. Ross. The
modern House of Babel which the Aus-
tralian man created and carried on with such
success has come to grief in the general
scrimmage. The students are at the front,
and the languages have been seized by the
Kaiser to write proclamations with. Pro-
fessor Tilley and his German-born children
remained British subjects, in the face of a
storm that would have driven meaner spirits
to become real lager-bier Teutons. Hence
temporary financial stress and much annoy-
ance.
There is a mention of Mrs. Martin Dono-
hoe having left nerve-racking Paris for a
while, and retired to the comparative seclu-
sion of Biarritz.
A Voice from the past echoes in from
Bathurst: —
With regard to your mention of the late Bobby
Crichton, who recently died in England, as an old
ltiverina man I can vouch for the following story.
Bobby had a mob of travelling wethers for sale, and
the late Robert Landale, of Landale Bros., got the
offer of them at 10s. a head. He arranged to meet
Bobby on the Billabong to inspect, and took lunch,
which included a case of champagne. After seeing
the mob he invited Bobby and all hands to the
banquet, before giving his decision. The dead
marines were thrown into a waterhole —thereafter
called in consequence Champagne Waterhole. Coming
at last to business Landale said: “Bobby, I’ll give
you 9s. 6d. a head.” But the fizz, instead of having
the expected effect of softening Crichton’s heart,
only stiffened his commercial instincts. “No, no,
Landale,” he answered, “my price now is 10s. 6d.,”
and the buyer gave it.
A sidelight on the Unspeakable’s desire
to throw his fez into the general turmoil
comes from Edinburgh. A Scotchbyterian
parson named Semple and his wife, formerly
of Australia, have been in charge of a
mission which helped the young Galilean to
learn something about domestic chores and
home industries —lace-making, etc. Soon
after the war broke out the Turks seized the
horses, cattle and anything else they could
put their hands on in the mission settlement.
The Semples were warned that the local
guardians of peace couldn’t be responsible for
the lives of foreigners. So the mission, being
more or less bankrupt in its larder, broke
up. and the Semples returned to Scotland.
Guillaume Daniel Delprat, who manages
the great affairs of the biggest Broken Hill
mining company, leaves by the Medina for
London this week. I expect he wants to buy
something or sell something. I am almost
sure the smiling Dutchman doesn’t propose
to shoot anybody, though his father was a
general and his wife’s family has simply
bristled with swords.
The Women Painters’ exhibition is, or
ought to be, open when this greets you.
Evelyn Chapman, the Sydney girl who
went abroad for a while, has come back with
some sketches of Belgium—before the war. A
good many specimens of her brush work hang
in the R.A.S. show. There’s a little bit of
Bruges, as Evelyn saw it, which attracted
the private viewers the other afternoon.
A former Sydney citizen, Mr. A. M. Marks,
passed over the border, at Margate, a few
weeks ago. He maintained some links with
N.S.W. to the end, continuing to be, among
other things, a director of Feldheim, Gotthelf
and Co. A son, Leslie, practises at the
English Bar.
The Civil Ambulance and Transport Corps
—a limb of St. John’s Ambulance—holds its
annual corobboree on November 26. Hon.
sec. Dr. Macneill Simpson mentions that you
needn’t be a subscriber to be welcome at this
meeting, which is to be held at the B.M.A.
rooms in Elizabeth-street.
George Lambert’s “Belle of the Alley,” at
the Society of Artists’ show, is a gorgeous
bit of brush work. It gives the usual curl-
ing-pin expression to the lady’s forelock.
Maud W. Kimbell, a Maoriland girl who
has been painting in Europe (mostly in
France) for some years, is here on a visit.
That public nuisance, the War, is likely to
keep her easel on this side of the Equator for
some time. She is showing vivid bits of
foreign life on the Society of Artists’ walls.
Alfred Clint, eldest son of the well-known
scene-painter of years ago, is following m
daddy’s steps. In his spare time he flings off
some charming bits of color.
In a guarded allusion to the “arrival” of
Dampier in Australia, Norman Lindsay sup-
plies a clue to the subject of his powerful
picture in the Society of Artists’ show.
Will Dampier, navigator and sea runner, was
in the vicinity of Shark’s Bay in 1699, drop-
rung the Roebuck’s anchor on or about July
26. He left in September, and went
off in his cockleshell craft to loiter in
the Pacific and peer around the Papuan
lagoons. But whether Will Dampier made
an “official” landing or not I don’t know.
In any case no artist wishes to thrust
Dampier forward as a bone of contention, to
be picked by those who insist that Cook
discovered Australia. The artist m
hopes to sell him on canvas.
The tall, picturesque young sculptor,
J. C. Wright, of the Byronic necktie, haa
some luck a while ago. Instead of haying
to depend on the uncertain wage ot cmser-
ling statuary for Australian posterity, tn
youthful Scot fell into a snug billet as lec-
turer in the Teachers’ Training College,
Blaekfriars. This allows him to pursue
Art, not wearily on foot, but mounted, so
to speak, on the back of a steady remuneia-
tion. Wright’s bit of modelling on view at
Julian Ashton’s eyrie is good enough _to
attract the Gallery Trustees, who are trying
to look both ways at once. The rush or
Art shows has almost overwhelmed tne
surge of knitting needles. The Gallery mag-
nates, in consequence, are supposed to be
thoroughly enjoying themselves —or other-
wise. Flitting from oil to oil, and panting
round acres of canvas, these hard-worked old
gentlemen are so busy wiping their spectacles
that they may miss something—perhaps the
last train home.
Nevill-Smith, a Maoriland musician who
comes this way now and again, organised a
Belgian Belief Concert in Timaru (M.L.) a
few weeks ago. Timaru is a small place
which occasionally has a large wreck on its
snarling coast, and it rose to the occasion
with a cheque of £167. For a one-night effort
this is something of a record, considering the
size of the village.
Mrs. Sargent, wife of the general manager
of Sargent’s, Ltd., the big restaurant people,
died at Springwood last week. She had been
long in ill-health.
The Silk Culture Society is young in years
and hard to beat for incurable optimism. Its
recent annual meeting (this must be about
its third) apparently realised that the society
was up against nearly everything a silkworm
could be up against. In spite of these trials
we are threatened with two books on the
domestic habits of the caterpillar, and the
lion, secretaries look the whole world in the
face with a mulberry leaf as their banner.
Dr. George Read is “port surgeon’’ of
Sydney, and the windows of his rooms at
Circular Quay are placarded with notices
concerning jumbuck vests. “One vest may
save a life” screams one flaming poster, and
“Warmth is as necessary as food” whispers
another in the ear of the casual passer-by.
The sheepskin garments which are being
hurriedly put together for Tommy Cornstalk
can be seen at this sub-committee’s depot;
and you will have no difficulty in getting
somebody to accept a contribution towards
the purchase of the comforts. Add the cost
of sending the vests to our men or the Allies
in the trenches, and they run to 6s. each.
Maggie Quong Tart is amongst the Aus-
tralian-born student-contingent which has
made a bee-line for home. She is a daughter
of the late Mandarin of the Coral Button
who was in business here for so many years.
Quong married an Australian, and his young-
sters, Maggie in particular, seem to have
the prevailing yearn for harmony. She has
been studying the various tricks of managing
a piano keyboard, but a shell has struck
the piano and wrecked it, and has also put
an end. for the time being, to any musical
career in Europe. So the girl tripped back
to her native Sydney.
The Women’s Handicrafts’ Society is
going to exhibit its wares in St. James’s
Hall on November 25. The needlecraft this
association turns out is one of the best
features. Repousse leather and china paint-
ing (good, bad and worse) also predominate
more or less.
Fashion progresses favorably on less
extravagant lines. The summer girl is laid
out in floral patterns that range from blooms
as small as threepenny bits to vegetables as
large as cauliflowers. The slim ghost of the
late Victorian flounce trails round the still-
narrow skirts, and the accommodating ankle-
slit shows a large area of stocking not always
worthy of a sonnet.
This year, owing to a cold eye being turned
on freakish prices, the shady hat is quite
popular. Instead of the ham-bone frill of
tulle perched on top of the head, the Sydney
damsel now squashes a commodious fine straw
covering well down on her hair, and puts her
face under the shelter of its few inches of
brim. Not always, of course. I saw a
Spartan soul, clothed in a little light drapery,
float down George-street the other morning.
About six inches of tulle had been tossed into
a bow and stuck on the summit of her golden
locks. With a 95-in-the-shade temperature it
looked a bit risky, providing the wearer had
any brains to be frizzled.
The Garcia School of Music is shaking its
hair-bows and tuning-up for the Patriotic
Cause. The concert is to be given in the
Town Hall on November 2S. William
McMillan, the York-street merchant, is
presiding over the committee which prods
the details into line.
Yours affectionately,
VANDORIAN.

MELBOURNE CHATTER.
Melbourne, November 36. 1914.
My Dear Yarrie, —
Captain Burnham, the dark, slim, bandy-
legged aide, who was employed by the Den-
mans chiefly because he knew all about polo,
has been wounded. His Australian wife has
taken a nursing course, so she should be
ready to deal \yith his case the moment he
arrives in England.
The Countess of Darnley (nee Miss Mor-
phy, of Melbourne) has fitted up her Kent
house, Cobham Hall, as a hundred-bed hospi-
tal. Mrs. Daniels-Roberts, one of the lady’s
nieces, yearns to go there and be a Titian-
haired vision of loveliness in blue-and-white
to interesting heroes.
By the way, all the marriageable girls are
going either into the hospitals or to the
front. It is the S’African war all over
again. The girl gets a hurried course of
training and immediately sets forth in search
of Atkins and matrimony. It is
natural that as Mahomet has left the moun-
tain, the mountain, so to speak, should go to
Mahomet. But it is rough on the latter
when he happens to be seriously hurt.
Aubrey Hoad, son of the late major-
general, has a commission in the Fifth
Dragoon Guards. So has young Oarington
(of whose engagement you have already
heard), and one Wentworth-Sta-nley, an
English cousin of the Wrixon-Miller clan.
Which reminds me that Arthur Robertson,
of Melbourne, is • in Belgium with the
A.M.C. It is a dreary fact lhat pretty well
every marriageable man is in Belgium in
some capacity or other.
Talking of the Gaud Mayor’s annual
blanket (no, banquet) in the Town
Hall —no one was, but what matter?
—the Mayoress asked her women friends
to watch the animals feed and hear
them roar afterwards. Having been first
primed for the ordeal with champagne
and sandwiches in the official lady’s own Blue
Room, they were planted in the galleries and
instructed to try to enjoy themselves. The
usual Bonds-of-Empire speeches were deliv-
ered, and the ladies cheered and applauded
and made squeaky, ecstatic noises, and in
other ways intimated to the gallant ones
below that they were on the* premises. It
was a most inspiring scene. Governor Stan-
ley touched the topknot of popular enthusi-
asm (if it has a topknot-—a matter in regard
to which there is some doubt) by personally
referring to the Russian, Belgian and French
Consuls, and the parts they had played in the
war. lie left a vague, general impression
that there were embryo Rennenkampfs, de
Guises and .Toffres to be found in every other
Block cafe. Such are the orator’s arts, my
dear. Seen from below, the women looked,
1 am told, as if they were in a gigantic bath.
Above the velvet rim of the gallery showed
fluffy ends of tulle, and emerging from them
were the nude necks, chests and shoulder-
blades of the proudest in the land. The only
discrepancy was the blinding jewellery which
illuminated the swaying sea of bareness. Few
women wash with the whole of the family
diamonds on them.
Pauline Higgins, of Toorak, is to be
married shortly to Edward Hollingdale, of
Sydney. Pauline’s ancestral home is reputed
to have a special Rolls-Royce car for every
member of the family and half a dozen over
for the servants. However, this may be an
exaggeration. All I can tell you from per-
sonal observation is that Pauline is bewitch-
ingly pretty, and acts as her own shover.
She also dances perfectly, and is under no
obligation to wear either switches, transfor-
mations or false fronts. Some girls have all
the luck. She met Edward at a ball on the
Australia. I have not seen Edward, but I
understand that he is young and beautiful,
and would rather be seen dead than wearing
elastic-side boots. The wedding is to happen
at St. Joseph’s, Malvern, on November 21,
and the subsequent party will be at Mon
Repos, which is one of the chief petrol-bases
of the W. 11. Higgins fleet of automobiles.
Ivy Clarke, youngest daughter of the late
dowager, was married to “Bob” Knox on
Wednesday of last week. The madding crowd
was absent owing to the war. The high con-
tracting parties didn’t want the crowd, and
the crowd was too depressed to force a way
into the ceremony. The ’groom—a son of the
late William of the Hat —was a Grammar
School boy, so the wedding ceremony was
put through in the school chapel. The bride
wore white satin, pink tulle, a pink velvet
obi sash, some pearls and an armful of lilies,
and she had Jess Fairbairn, of the ruddy hair,
for bridesmaid. Jess also wore pink tulle
and cascades of pink roses. The heroine
looked picturesquely pretty with a frame
of smoothly-banded black hair and a becom-
ingly pale, creamy complexion. Roma Clarke
was to have been one of the bridesmaids, but
she waited so long in England that she lost
her chance. Hordes of Knoxes descended
like mediaeval raiders from Upper Beacons-
field, where they have a number of mountain
strongholds. Members of the pastorally
illustrious house of Fairbairn were there in
platoons owing to their kinswoman’s connec-
tion with the show; and Ivnibbs only knows
how many Clarkes figured in the throng. The
Reggie Clarkes gave a breakfast party after-
wards at Womagana, to which I was not
asked. I can only tell you of the gorgeous-
ness of the presents, accordingly, by hearsay.
Some of our very nicest detectives, armed to
the teeth, and stone sober, were there to look
after them, and altogether an atmosphere of
almost overpowering opulence was achieved.
The pair left ultimately—she in cool, white
linen and a panama hat —for the Mount
Martha house on the bay, as a preliminary
to a trip to Sydney.
Daisy Clifton, daughter of the joyous widow
who descends on Melbourne from Banana-
land every Cup Time with six Saratogas
and a fleet of hat-boxes, has just finished
honeymooning. Her wedding was “one of
those quiet affairs.” The bride’s brother
motored her up from Sydney, where she had
been garnering trousseau, and her mother
took a cottage in Brisbane for the city
season. After the festival the widow re-
turned by motor to Jesslands, the family
station, and underwent a Rest Cure —neces-
sitated, I take it, by the quietude of the
nuptials.
Poor Dr. Angus McNab, formerly of
Maoriland. was butchered by the Huns
whilst bandaging the wounded on the battle-
field. He was a successful eye doctor in
Harley-street, London, where the fashion-
able specialists are encamped; and was
married to Evelyn Calder. of St. Ivilda, who
is here now with her parents.
A fine old Geelong lady is worrying about
the soldiers’ socks. Half the newly-enthused
Sassiety knitters do not know that the wool,
of which these garments is constructed,
should be shrunk before it is made up. If it
isn’t first shrunk the socks will knot up, and
then our warriors will be cursing the friend
when they should be chasing the foe.
The question is still being asked wherever
a few of our noblest are gathered together:
Where is Florence Winter-Irvine ? She in-
cautiously wedded an official in the Turkish
Embassy at Berlin; and, of late, she appears
to have vanished. She was last heard of
in Constantinople, which is a horrible place
to be heard-of in, apart from its smells and
its crimes. Was she put in a bag along with
a boulder, and buried in the Bosphorus?
Most of our returned trippers are dressed
wholly in black. It is not a proclamation of
mourning, but Fashion’s latest shriek —the
Paris costumi&re’s tribute to the solemnity
of the moment.
Kingsburgli’s owner has abandoned his
turf name, “K. S. McLeod,” and will race
henceforth as himself —L. Iv. S. Mackinnon.
Did you notice, by the way, that the initials
of the cheery Scot’s turf name pointed to the
first three in the Cup: K.S.M. —Kingsburgli,
Sir Alwynton, Moonbria?
By the way, the V.R.C. needs a sharp
bash over the knuckles for its indifference to
the illfare of wounded jockeys. As an ambu-
lance conveyance the cart has long since been
supplemented in other parts by the swift and
easy-running motor-car. One badly-hurt
rider who fell in the Cup Steeplechase was
trundled in a horse-drawn vehicle half-way
round the course before he reached the hos-
pital. As he passed the grandstand he sat
up and waved to show that he was still alive,
but the effort was too much for him and he
toppled over in a faint, with his head over
the edge of the cart. The crowd had to
draw the attention of the ambulance man,
who was on the box seat, to the tragedy that
was occurring behind him. On the same
occasion G uncap’s jockey had to be carried
on a jogging stretcher for a couple of hun-
dred yards. It may be all unavoidable on a
battlefield, but not on the course of one of
the richest racing clubs in the world.
Last week I said that one “Dr. William-
son,” of the U.S.A., was making trouble in
connection with the will of J. C. William-
son, and that as a result the children are,
metaphorically, stone broke and have to beg
for their tram fares. I have just had it on
the most unimpeachable authority that the
children have no relative named Dr. Wil-
liamson, and that they have a handsome
allowance paid to them monthly. As Sadi
Ben Hafiz well put it in his “Desert Dia-
tribes” : “The untrustworthy runner is as a
banquet of dust to the news-hungry literary
girl.”
Lindsay Russell, who took her literary
talent to London and married the doctor in
charge of her case, is writing cheery letters
to Melbourne friends over the signature of
Patricia Scott. After the war there may
be a health jaunt to Australia, for the fogs
are worrying “Pat’s” respiratory organs.
By the way, the wedding was something of
an Anglo-Australian event, and two Philp
girls, nieces of the ex-Premier of Queens-
land, were among the bridesmaids. The
bride has discovered that her ’way-back rela-
tives help to make Australian history—of a
sort. Her great grandfather, Captain Stone-
house, took the first shipload of convicts to
Tasmania, and his nephew, Lieutenant Quin,
was the first boss of the convict settlement.
Toorak simply seethed at the rumor that
the wife of Canon Drought had been run in
by an Irish Bobby as a Teutonic spy. it
appears she was found sketching scener.v on
the Irish coast. The poor lady was a God-
frey, my dear, and British to the toes.
When a patient was scalded to death at
Kew the other day the Coroner remarked
that it was a case of misadventure, and the
authorities suspended the second-grade nurse
who was in charge of the victim—and 6o
others. It appears that when a nurse goes
on duty at Kew it is customary for her to
take delivery of her patients by signing for
them. This nurse had charge of a com-
paratively easy lot in ward five, _ for whom
she signed, and of 18 others, requiring strict
supervision, in a tent, for whom she did not
sign, probably because it was reckoned that
66 silly citizens were too many for one
junior to sign for, although not too many
for her to be responsible for. This nurse also
had the job of making coffee for the working
patients. It was while she was absent mak-
ing coffee that one patient in the tent ward
commandeered boiling water (nobody knows
how) and proceeded to bathe a sister. When
the bath proved fatal, the nurse, as stated,
was suspended for being unable to make
coffee and attend to 66 mental patients in
two far-separated wards simultaneously.
A grey sky wrapped in a cold wind did a
good deal to remove the ginger from an
indignation meeting of sea-bathers at St.
Kilda on. Sunday morning. The local council
decided recently that sea-bathing, after 10
a.m., is destructive to the morals of the
young. So the usual old meeting of protest
was advertised to take place at St. Kilda.
A nice young man mounted on the sea-wall
and said various things in favor of open
sea-bathing. He told the onlookers that “he
admired ladies in the water,” and blushed
when a cheer greeted the remark. He also
passionately reminded his audience that the
sea “belonged to the people.” Tame house-
holders with the customary old baby in tow
listened gloomily while the orator, in a pero-
ration that recalled Grattan, or Pitt,
or Willy Kelly, implored them “to take
the matter up.” Members of the Life Sav-
ing Club stood around shuddering in bathing
togs. A few young women, blue-lipped and
defiant, fixed the plain-clothes policeman
with unfriendly eyes, and then dashed once
more into the icy sea. “just to show them.”
The captain of the life-savers offered freely
to save the life of any of the bystanders
“who would take off their clothes and oblige
the sightseers by pretending .to be drowned.”
As he said nothing about also providing a
free cure for pneumonia, there were no
takers. True, a small boy was observed to
be removing his coat, but upon an unwary
request being made to him to “step for-
ward” he suddenly- bolted across the sand
like a sinful soul pursued by devils, and was
presently lost to view. A. dispirited photo-
grapher took shelter from the blast
in a flapping dressing tent. Two bulldogs
had just begun to chew it to pieces, with
the apparent object of getting at the artist,
when a fierce gust of wind, followed by
thunder and a downfall of rain, brought a
gloomy entertainment to an end.
From my Adelaide correspondent:—
The rain in the Upper North on Friday was a fine
meteorological effort while it lasted. The Petersburg
post office became an inaccessible island. People had
to be rescued in trollies from the houses in the
lower part of the township. A boy fell into a drain
and was drowned. Meanwhile Adelaide, 150 miles
away, remained as dry as a sermon and as muggy
as an orchid house. The only places that look like
benefiting are the hills and the seaside resorts, where
our homes of climatic refuge are. The Frank Downers
have taken the Walter Hawkers’ house at Mt. Lofty,
and the H. 0. Caves are already in the Burns-Cum-
ming mansion in the same cool locality.
Miss Lizzie Waite and songstress Clara Kleinschmidt
arrived from England on Friday. The arrival of the
war knocked their concert-giving schemes on the
head. Talking of musical folk, Bryceson Trehearne is
a prisoner in Germany. His wife, who was Miss
Maud Thacker,y, of Adelaide, is living as near his
place of detention as possible.
On Saturday there was a garden fete for the Bel-
gian fund at Mount Lofty. Mr. Francis Snow lent
his grounds, and there was a payable crowd present.
The “Monster Entertainment” duly came off on
Friday. The blistering heat was a help to the Ameri-
can soda bar in the Western Annexe, a resort where
everything in the way of iced non-intoxicants was to

There were items by local amateurs and pros., also

The seventeenth Federal Art Exhibition had its
private view oh Friday evening at the Society of
Arts Rooms on North Terrace. On the same after-
noon the Dandies gave an At Home in the banquet-
ing room at the Town Hall. This co., by the way,
handed the proceeds of its Thursday night’s perform-
ance to the Belgians, and the Galways and Irvings
turned up to nod their approval.
“Bobby” Cruickshank, the youthful Adelaide lawyer
who was three times mayor of St. Peter’s, has sent a
very young son to the war. He was a second-year
law student, also he had something to do with the
navy. In his anxiety to get to the Front he finally
joined the Army Medical Corps.
An alleged Nelson relic in the shape of a
silver whistle, said to have been used by the
Admiral when on board the Victory, was
offered to the trustees of the Victorian
National Museum last week. The price,
which the Trustees refused to pay, was a
modest £l5O. According to the family
legend the whistle, which bears the inscrip-
tion, “Horatio Nelson, 1801,” was given to
a Dr. Osmond by Nelson. From the doctor
it passed to his son, the late M.L.C., whose
niece, a Mrs. Richmond, now has the exclusive
privilege of blowing it —except, of course, in
a metaphorical way. Anybody who likes is
privileged to blow it, metaphorically.
Patriotic sentiment can be turned to many
uses. The fact was demonstrated in a Mel-
bourne suburb the other afternoon. A large,
prosperous city haberdasher was driving a
motor-car load of ladies towards Brighton,
and, being more concerned with the ruddy
dame at his elbow than with the lay of the
road, came within half an ace of running
over a little girl. The catastrophe was
averted by a youth in khaki, who made a
dash for the child, snatched her up, and got
away with her. But he left the heel of his
boot under the car wheel, and received so
bad a wrench to his ankle that subsequently
he had to be carted home in a cab. The
man in the motor-car was not ungrateful
for the timely intervention that had saved
him from an awful mess, nor disposed to
ignore the lad's bravery. He made a * ‘
speech about it from the car, concluding.
“And here, my young friend, is somethin,, to
reward you for your presence of mind ana
your gallantry— something you as a soldiei
of the King will appreciate at its true
worth.” The portly patriot had present, d

On Saturday, when the sea had '•ld feet
and an evil frown —the aftermaths of "a thun-
derstorm —some brave spirits went down the
bay on behalf of the Empire. Mrs. Ilagel-
tliorn was chiefly responsible. She charged
five shillings for each ticket, which included
an afternoon tea that nobody wanted. The
proceeds went to one of the Red Cross funds.
Parliamentarians were thick among the bay-
goers, and a brass band cheered them up.
Also, Kitty Gleeson, who is somehow related
to the Hagelthorns, sang fairly cheerfully
when the rolling billows gave her a chance.
But it could not rightly be termed an
hilarious afternoon, on the whole.

A chance lady traveller brings the news
that the Kaiser’s hair turned white in a
single night. The exact night is not speci-
fied, but probably it was the night he really
began to think. What he should do now is
to shed his hair altogether and grow a crop
of white feathers. Then he could make a
grand final appearance as the Dove of Peace,
or something of the kind.
The newsboys passed my library window
the other night yelling “Murder —Kit-
chener shot.” Needless to say, though clad
only in the costume prescribed by the
Writers’ Union. I dashed out a penny for
the sheet. Judge my fury when I found
that some hash-house kitchener had mur-
dered the cook and then shot himself. Many
of these lads are a positive disgrace to Ihe
journalistic profession.
Two very dissimilar artists, Robert Camm
and Captain Press, are revealing their quali-
ties in a joint exhibition at the Athenseum.
Camm is probably our most industrious
painter of the humble cow. He depicts the
lady in all aspects and weathers, and is only
unsuccessful when a special bit of foreshort-
ening throws his drawing into disorder. In
his landscapes the artist is a plain recorder
ol: homely details, but he shows in No. 40
“A Sunny Corner,” that he is capable of
achieving a colorable imitation of a work of
art. Captain Press, who is recklessly
charged _ with being the raw material of a
genius, is the shipping reporter of the local
art world. He insists vehemently on the
pictorial importance of all sail craft. Though
some of his billows roll in ragtime and sun-
dry skies appear to be composed from a
secret recipe, Press is often entertaining.
Anyhow, the mere Bloke will derive pleasure
from his portentous, warlike effusions, not
to mention his realistic study of a fire at
sea. And Press is essentially a painter for
the Bloke.
Yours sincerely,
JOHANNA.

Workmanship !
The concentrated energies of an immense organization, model
factories, well-nigh 2,000 skilled mechanics, are focussed
solely in the production of Triumph Cycles and Motor Cycles.
These immense resources are a positive safeguard against inferiority, and when
coupled with honest material as in the Triumph, are worth more than any
guarantee of the most extravagant description.

POLITICAL
POINTS
The deed of N.S.W. Justice Heydon, m
levying £2OOO worth of fines on the Northern
Miners’ Federation and £5O each on 10
officials thereof, should end an untidy situa-
tion, unless the Government remits the fines
and so prolongs the untidiness. The Labor
party, being in power, is responsible for the
anti-strike law, which it so consistently
breaks or dodges on the ground that it is an
unjust statute. Therefore it deserves to be
regularly fined £2500 (the proceeds go to the
Labor Government’s Treasury) until it
devises a just measure which it will be pre-
pared to observe. If it doesn’t attend to this
matter it will assuredly fall in. That is to
say, it will go out of oince leaving the
disgruntled statute in force, and a new
Government will arise which won’t remit the
fines.
THE MAN WITH THE MUCK-RAKE.
From a man who- certainly knows--: —- -
A Bulletin correspondent said (22/10/’l4) :
(1) The Melbourne Board of Shirks decided to
import the pipes for its subsidiary Maroondah supply,
for it is the Board’s whole gxispel that it is better
to pay 6d. to the foreigner than get a better article
made locally for 6d., or even sd.
(2) The very old and inadequate Yan Yean reser-
voir holds 26ft. of water when it is full, but one
miserable day last week it wasn’t half-full. In fact,
it contained only lift, of water.
I am sorry that, as on a previous occasion, The
Bulletin has been misinformed regarding the policy
of the Board. Right from the start it has never
imported pipes. All cast-iron pipes are made locally.
The contract to which The Bulletin’s correspondent
alludes was let (after the usual advertising) to
Mephan Ferguson P’t’y for £36,582. The pipes are
of steel, and Of a special type known as locking-bar,
for which the firm named has an exclusive patent.
As neither the plates nor the bars can be obtained in
Australia, they must of necessity be procured else-
where. All of the work associated with the making
of these pipes, apart from the bringing in of the
raw material, is to be done in Melbourne. What
other course can this correspondent suggest? He is
guilty of misinformation when he says that the Yan
Yean reservoir was not half-full, and contained only
lift, of water. The lowest depth reached by the
reservoir in over a quarter of a century was 12ft. on.
May 5, 1908. Since September 4 last the depth has
been continuously more than 16ft.
BLACK CATS ARE LUCKY.
(Startling discovery of well-known fact by
Granny'S. M. HERALD since the war.)
GRANNY: “Puss! Puss! Come and live with
me an' cocky."
Lloyd-George has borrowed an epigram
from a Melbourne page of cartoonlets in an
August Bulletin. Vincent’s picture showed
the Kaiser rubbing his leg after knocking
against the Belgian porcupine, bristling
bayonets, and saying: “I t’ink it vos not a
silly rabbit; the tarn t’ing’s a porcupine.”
Lloyd-George, rousing London last week,
said that the German vulture, after hovering
over Belgium, “thought it was pouncing on a
rabbit, but it fell on a hedgehog.” Ostend
rabbits, by the ' way, are Belgium’s best-
known export of food to Britain.
Vic. Labor party has done nothing better
lately than in separating itself from all the
sectarians. The attitude is put succinctly
in Elmslie’s “Hands oft' the Act!” li.C.
Archbishop Mannix scolds the party very
delicately for playing this lone hand.
“Assuming* that the proportion of Catholics
in the<* Labor party was 40 per cent., the
Labor party had told 40 per cent, of its
membership to go about its business. . . .with
reference to the education question. He
doubted whether the Labor Catholics were
going to stand that from the Labor party.”
And then he sidesteps as quickly as Adeline
Genee: “He did not want them to fall out
with the Labor party. He wanted to save
the Labor party. He wanted to give it a
leg on, to save it for all time.” The gentle-
man who wants to save a political party,
and for such an impossible period as “all
time,” by “giving it a leg on” to the sec-
tarian buckjumper, is a hopeless proposition.
By Sydney Telegraph—a whoop or a
slump or something :
High Protection drove many manufacturers from
the United States and great sums of money across
the border to Canada in search of untaxed raw
material. And what the worker thinks about “the
fiscal question” has been attested on the Dutch and
German frontier. German manufacturers have built
houses for their workmen on Dutch ground because
the living there is so much cheaper than under the
high German tariff. There is not a political Labor
party in Europe that supports Protection.
Yet Canada, with a larger area than the
United States, has less than a tenth of the
population, so apparently a lot of U.S. man-
ufacturers haven’t been driven across yet.
And the Freetrade Dutchman is certainly
less wealthy than the Protectionist German,
though he may live more cheaply 12s. a
week for a sergeant of police, for instance,
isn’t a palatial wage. And D. D. Braham,
the bright, fresh editor of the Telegraph,
lately fled from Freetrade Britain to make a
hotter living in semi-Protectionist Australia.
Now, having arrived here, he has the front
to say that Labor parties are mostly Free-
trade,' and to imply that that proves Free-
trade to be good. Doesn’t D. D. Braham get
his salary for the job of demonstrating that
Labor parties don’t know enough to come in
out of the wet?
—la-order te-boost up the job * e
trapper, N.S.W. Agriculture Minister Ash
ford lately decided that no farmer or other
landowner should be allowed to poison ra
bits within 30 miles of a freezing works.
This brilliant scheme for breeding rabbits,
order to give employment m catching the ,
2 prompted the Society for
of Free Drinks to urge on the Goveinment
that the unemployed should be granted fre
bottled beer, in order to provide woik toi
the bottle-os in collecting the dead marines.
These are-cold days for -the shneking suf-
fragettes; and it looks as though for them
it never will be summer again. }\hen the
war began, the value of the individual as
compared with the nation suffered a most
awful slump. Hundreds of human lives
became as packets of pins m then _unim
portance beside the mam issue, and the
horrors in Belgium left the suffragettes
without a shred of martyrdom to their backs.
What would the death of mamma Pankhuist
from self-starvation, crying ‘ \ otes tor
women!” with her parting breath have mat-
tered in the light of the latest list
of casualties? So the suffragette move-
ment dropped dead. And n it is
ever resurrected the militants will have
to change some of their spots, and leave
off talking opposition to “human slaughter.
Anv party which babbles peace whilst the
Kaisers of the period are building bomb-
shells by the billion will have a hard row to
hoe while this generation lives.
Considering the frequent demands made
by the Tanksinkers’ Union and the Amalga-
mated Fossickers for an increased issue ot
Federal notes (those already issued being
mostly in a state of decomposition in
the banks because the Tanksinkers and
others won’t use them), how about
abolishing both the half-sovereign and
the sovereign? The former, which looks
like a dim chip knocked off a brass god
in the twilight, should be abolished in any
case. Let us have a beautiful £2 or £3, or
(better still) £4 gold piece, which will look
like a cart-wheel of bullion or the sun set-
ting behind a pawnshop in Jerusalem. Then
the small change would consist of notes, on
which the Commonwealth could make a solid
profit; silver, on which there is a very sub-
stantial profit (the shilling is worth 4d. or
sd. in actual metal) ; and bronze, which is
almost all profit. A system under which the
£4 piece was the smallest gold coin would
give the note circulation a very good boom
without any special legislation. If John
Bull was too amazed to speak when he re-
ceived his interest in £4 pieces he could
send them to the mint and have them boiled
down into the old familiar one-pounders.
ROUND AND ROUND THE MUL
BERRY BUSH.
Dr. M. J. Holmes, who for three and a half years
has occupied the position of Chief Health Officer and
Medical Protector of Aborigines at Port Darwin,
gave it as his opinion that the future of the
Northern Territory was assured, providing that the
Government realised fully the necessity for a proper
system of control in regard to health matters.
Tropical diseases in the Territory were practically
non-existent, and there should be no fear of physical
prostration as the result of settlement in the
northern outpost of the continent. — Newspaper.
THE ELEPHANT : "It’s a long, long way to
Tipperary .”
The Westralian election has been some-
thing of a disaster for the Labor Govern-
ment, and Premier Scaddan’s majority is
down to two. When he has found a Speaker
his majority will be one, and when a pair of
members go away to bury their aunt he is
liable to be in a minority. Yet with the
simple device of an Elective Ministry, fixed
for the duration of Parliament, the whole
party might go away to bury its grand-
mother without seriously upsetting the busi-
ness of the country.
Britain is thinking seriously that e
would have been advantages about a comp
sory service army. If you hit your <^ em
right at the beginning of break
hammer weighing two tons you 44,50
him there and then. If you hit
times, spread over two years, with a h
weighing one pound, you may be _
you may not. That is the difference
tween the army that is quite iead>
one that dribbles in by instalments.
THE LIGHT AHEAD.
Owing to the darkened outlook Mr. Holman
announces that negotiations have been resuned with
the Norton Griffiths Co. in regard to the finnncing
of public works. — N.S.W. frenzied finance item.
Not so dark that he cannot see the sign.
Like a good many others, F. Lyons, one
of four Liberal candidates for Goulburn
Valley (Vic.), has an artless manner ol
facing both ways on the sectarian question.
He “doesn’t believe in interfering with the
secular basis of the present Education Act.
But he “cannot see that the reading in
schools of selected Bible stories should be
condemned.” All the same, he would be
sorry to see religious questions brought into
politics.” Having thus declared himself tor
and against the Bible in State schools, and
having discussed the question and intimated
that he didn’t think the question should be
discussed, candidate Lyons usually concludes
by considering the handling of grain. A
consistent Lyons would tell the Goulburn
Valley cockies that he believed in handling
wheat in bulk, and was also convinced that
it should be handled in bags ; and, moreover,
he was opposed to expressing an opinion
either way. But, being inconsistent, and
knowing that the cocky wants grain on tins
subject and not chaff, Lyons is wise enough
to declare definitely for bulk handling.
Some inappropriate ass, with a vague
recollection of the old anti-Victorian craze
in his soul, rushed into print, under the
impression that the Sydney was, by reason
of its name, a purely N.S.W. ship, and that
the capture of German Papua was a
purely N.S.W. enterprise, because the squad-
ron started from Sydney. Then came along
the list of sailors who were wounded in the
scrap with the Emden pirate. Eleven were
mentioned —one from England, two from
N.S.W.; three with no addresses given; and
five from Victoria.
The Melbourne City Fathers are growing
alarmed at the prospect of the Peacock Gov-
ernment annexing the metropolitan tram-
ways and running them as adjuncts to the
suburban railway system. Also they are
beginning to realise that the companies
which own the motor-’buses pay precious
little towards the maintenance of the roads,
which their vehicles cut, to pieces. So what
with one menace and another they are pon-
dering a proposition to buy out the ’bus
companies and run services themselves.
It is probably the best, thing they can do
now, though of course they should have
choked off opposition by running lines of
motor-’buses first. Anyhow, if the Govern-
ment is going to electrify and manage the
tramway systems, and if the combined coun-
cils intend to run motor-’bus services, the
public will have a joyous time. But there
won’t be any profits in the business. Mean-
while, it is interesting to note that the
Tram Co., whose lease exnires in less than
20 months, lies low and says nothing.
THE RUINOUS OPTIMIST.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
He was not a pessimist or disposed to take gloomy
views. —Premier Holman, of N.S.W., on himself.
Of loans we have a dreadful list,
All piled up by an optimist,
A sprightly, legal optimist
An optimist who stood for Peace,
And smoothed the ways with golden grease
On which we slid to—where we are.
He never thought we’d go too far,
For he was still an optimist—
A sleekly-legal optimist!
A golden-guinea optimist!
Did Common Sense approach him, “Ha !”
He’d slyly chuckle, “there you are!’’
And from the dull intruder twist,
Inferring thereby “Case dismissed!”
He was indeed
In ev’ry need
A very ready optimist.
Our’ money mill would still have grist,
Had we but got a pessimist—
A grudging, carping pessimist
A pessimist with bilious eyes
Who heard no tales with glad surprise—
A man as sceptical as —oh !
As nineteen devils in a row!
A drab, a deadly pessimist!
A hairless, hopeless pessimist!
A really perfect pessimist!
A Treasurer of shifts and lurks
To whom the siren Public Works
Might have unleashed her sweetest shout
To get a job at scrubbing-out!... .
Misfortune poor old Ma State kissed—
She did, indeed —
When, in its need,
She sent it Holman, Optimist.

This year’s Melbourne Cup was the oord.
The year 1861 saw the first race, although there was
no Cud then; it was a sweepstakes of £2O. The
following year 200 sovs. were added by the V.R.C.,
and in 1876 the chairman, James Blackwood, pre-
sented a gold cup. The added money was then
500 sovs. Gradually it was increased until, in the
days before the boom burst and the middle fell out
of things, it amounted to £lO,OOO. To-day the

After the last day at Flemington people
were mostly of opinion that there had been a little
too much De Gama at the Cup meeting. The name
of De Gama, from Maoriland. has been heard in the
land for months past, what time he was running on
up-the-line courses and Winning as often as not. His
Melbourne record previous to Derby Day was three
wins and two places in seven starts. For the
Coburg Stakes the much-talked-of animal was
weighted at only Bst. 31b., in spite of his wins and
his reputation. Somebody must have thought him
favorably handicapped, for he was backed down to
2 to 1. After a fine finish De Gama beat the flying
Tadanga, with the Doncaster Handicap winner, First
Principle, in third place. His next appearance was
on Oaks Day. He was chucked into the Carnival
Handicap at the same old Bst. 31b., and the world
thought so well of him that he started at 5 to 4.
Won again. On Saturday the victorious steed was
raised 101 b for two brilliant wins within ; a
week! —and again he started favorite, and won.
Evidently the handicapper had been too gentle with
De Gama. Meanwhile the stewards of the V.A.T.C.
had put a damper on the De Gammonese by refusing
the nomination of the horse, for reasons connected
with the ownership— i.e., on account of suspicions
appertaining thereto. But that doesn’t explain evefy-
t fling. ,
“O’Cork”: The Bulletin’s summary of
Kingsburg’s Cup as “the usual disappointment” was
cold truth. In the last 32 years only five absolute
first favorites and two who shared favoritism with
others got home first. During that period 19 abso-
lute favorites and five half-favorites failed even to
get a place! Apologue (1907) was the last out-
right favorite to win. Prince Foote (1909) was half-
favorite with Trafalgar. The gaps are awful. Mar-
tini-Henry (1883) was picked by the crowd and won.
Then for six years five successive favorites were
unplaced and a sixth ran third before Carbine scored.
* * * *
Jockey G. Meddiclt’s wins in the Mel-
bourne Cup and Veteran Stakes earned in percentage
alone £402 6s. W. H. McLaelilan’s paysheet for the
Cup meeting showed £266 and R. Lewis’s £252.
»'* * *
“Cardenir”: The wowser is so keen in his
denunciation of the good points of horse-i'acing that
he fails to see the bad ones. What, then, has a
plain man to say when he reads that George Meddick,
who rode Kingsburgh to victory at the Cup, actually
weighs no more than sst. lOlb .? Remember the
patter of the “merry and bright” Peter Doody? “Half
a carraway-seed and a bottle of soda-water since
yesterday, and I didn’t have the carra wav-seed.
Maria, for it stuck in my ’ollow tooth!” That's how
these boys are wasted, and it’s degrading a noble
sport., How many spectators of the Cup who pique
themselves on being good Australians have paused one
second to consider that for the sake of their so-called
“sport” an Australian lad, aged 18, has been starved
to a weight of 801 b.? It would be preferable to
abolish horse-racing altogether rather than tolerate
so unpatriotic an iniquity.
* * * *
Backers of recent and consistent form
had a day of consolation at Caulfield last Saturday,
when Winnipeg, Hush Money and Golden Wire won
races. The books offered reasonable prices, all
things considered. Hush Money, going out at 8 to 1,
took the Armadale Cup, worth £7OO to “Jimmy’’
Wilson, the owner. Ancient James has not picked up
a good handicap prize for some years that The
Bulletin can remember, and the victory of the black
jacket and white cap came as a reminder of the
nast. Why, he started a filly named Musidora in the
Melbourne Cup of 1862, and he won it with Briseis,
daughter of Musidora aforesaid, in 1876!
* * * *
“T.”: Saw a lad of uncertain ago —say
14 —collecting a 100 to 3 wager after Melb. Cup. It
was, presumably, a stablebov’s bet, but the youngster
was evidently new to the business of drawing
’underds. His hand shook so that the bookie pater-
nally took hold of it to steady it, saying: “All right,
sonny, you’ll get paid.” Rather a painful thing to
see a kid drawing a wager so big that he trembles
at the thought of it. #
There was, after all, one paper in Aus-
tralia that handed the Cup to Ivingsburgh before the
event. The little Westralian WorkSr reckoned that
as Kingsburgh (Bst. 81b.) was only beaten by a
short half-neck bv Ulva’s Isle (Bst. lib.) in the
Randwiclt Trial Stakes, the Wallace horse with 241 b.
off his back should easily beat Ulva’s Isle (with an
added 21b.). or any other horse, in the big race.
The only thing the 'Worker could not understand
was how the bookies had overlooked that fact when
they made Kingsburgh an outsider at 20’s.
Melb. Herald was a witness for the truth
the other day by the grace of a typographical error
in the advt. of a pony race-meeting. Thus:—
There will be a good supply of racebooks in the
city and at the course.
And then, in large caps:—
1/-. RACE BOOBS. 1/-.

“Billy T.’s” picture of the thing the par-
sons would rather have than the orderly mechanical
tote: At Flemington on Cup Day I walked under the
elms. There was general uproar, much dust, tobacco
smoke and weird noises from the champing jaws of
ravening bookies. About one son of Judah a clamor-
ous crowd was collected. It fought wildly, shaking
fists full of money under his nose. His eyes ob-
truded, his lips were marked with a black rim; foam
was in the corners of his mouth. He barked,, snorted
and snapped like a maddened dog. Then a shrinking
little, eight-year-old boy, clinging to his father’s leg,
cried piteously: “Oh. dadda, dadda, what are they
doing to the poor man'?”
“Double-book” bettors in Sydney are in a
turmoil. The cards issued for last week’s meeting
at Rosehill omitted the name of the winner in the
handicap, Trinobantes (6st. 71b.). The chief axiom
of betting is—“no chance to win, no bet.” Some
conscientious bookmakers accepting this have re-
turned the invested coin to those who had a leg-in
for the “double.” Others refuse, alleging that
“double-betting” is “all in.” Tattersall’s Club will
probably be the arbiter in the squabble.
Last week Brisbane Cup went to Frasca,
with 21 others toiling behind. Frasca was favorite
at three to one, and, for once in a way, Ikev’s odds
shone brightly by comparison with the totalisator,
which returned £3 7s. for each sovereign invested,
But the machine paid a generous dividend of £3 10s.
on the second prad, while Mo paid nothing at all.
Frasca is another instance of a rise from the ranks.
His first win was a £lO stake on the Darling Downs,
in 1912.
A number of Sydney ponies ran in the
Melbourne “Ascot Thousand” the other day.
A wire was posted at Victoria Park, Sydney,
a few minutes after the big race, giving Clanfera as
the winner and John Porter as runner-up. The
‘ Locks” duly paid out. Presently a second telegram
transpired stating that John Porter was the real
winner, with Clanfera nowhere. Then the unhappy
MeNcses realised that he had been betrayed. But
he merely took a reef or two in his odds, and, with
a brave smile on his face, proceeded to get it all back
within a week or so.
The trotting owners and breeders of
Maoriland are clamoring for a better system of han-
dicapping their mokes than leaving it to one_ man’s
judgment. The powerful Owners and Breeders' -Ass’n
has rushed an ultimatum at the Trotting Ass’n
demanding that all unplaced maiden horses shall be
on the same mark; that no horse shall be handi-
capped slower than its best winning performance;
that no fraction of a second shall count against a
horse’s record; and that horses running second or
third and improving on their previous best shall he
entitled to an allowance of lsec. up to 1-j miles and
2sec. up to two miles. The penalties, for winning in
certain times are also set out, so that the handicap-
ping will become an automatic affair if the proposals
come into effect. The unknown and untried horse
will be on a definite mark, and the others will he on
the fixed marks determined bv their best perform-
ances. All of which seems mighty reasonable.
Whether the M.L. Ass. will consider it reasonable is
another thing. If it doesn’t, there is likely to be
an earthquake.
MEHEGA N-GRIFFITHS AT SYDNEY
STADIUM.
What it feels like to be knocked. (Ask Hughie.)
The Griffiths-Mehegan fight at Sydney
Stadium on Saturday night was a poor show.
Mehegan never had a hope. For the first four
rounds he smothered heavily, but to no effect, and
Griffiths scored as he pleased. Mehegan’s was not
defensive fighting; it was merely protective. He had
no notion of bringing Griffiths to him and then hand-
ing over the goods. True, Griffiths required no more
inviting than a debt-collector, but whenever he
called Mehegan was out. The punch that Griffiths de-
livered in the fifth round read like a romance and was
of the sort that the curate administers in his day-
dreams. It landed “just there,” whereupon
Mehegan’s head rocked, and he fell like a dishcloth.
Any ordinary fighter would have slept for days,
but Mehegan was back in a sort of way at the count
of eight, and crawled through the round, though he
collapsed at the close of it. In the sixth Mehegan
woke up, came back, mixed it freely, and won easily
on points, after landing some real good stuff; but
in the seventh he wilted again, and early in the
eighth he took the count. He took it to a punch which
must have felt like a submarine, and the writer would
willingly pay some German paper money he has got
to see its twin collected by the Kaiser. The show it-
self resembled that which Wilhelm has staged inas-
much as the result was really decided before the cur-
tain rose. #
“The Oldest Inhabitant”: Amongst the
sports of the old Cornstalk days pugilism held a
first place. In 1832 there was a “boxing boom,”
chiefly in the Windsor and Parramatta districts.
The first battle of any note was between Abe Davis
and Joe Dargin, in 1819. Davis was a Petticoat
Lane Jew, who had come out for his “country’s
good,” as did many excellent men. This match was
the ’first professionally made in Australia. The
Jew was a glutton for punishment and won, but
candidly confessed that he had had enough. The
next fight of consequence was between Jackson and
Sullivan —for £lO a side. The ring was in a
paddock on the Liverpool-road, near the Plo^ ll I lH ;
Jackson won in 15 rounds. Jack Ivable, ehampio
of Parramatta, had a show against one Bill Clarke,
who had the reputation of having killed a man with
a single blow, liable was a native, known as ‘
the Miller,” from the fact that he worked for his
relative, die Windsor miller, Teale. fable beat
Clarke and then beat George Glew. At Windsor
Chalker met Jack Hobbs, the latter winning in 31
rounds. Then Chalker tackled Morgan the black,
known as “The Black Diamond,” the first good abo.
fighter unearthed. Chalker beat lnm After that
there was a tremendous affair. Chalkei issued a
challenge to Eable to tight for £lOO a side. Kable
being willing, they fought in a roped ring. Chalker
won, much to the disgust of Parramatta and
Windsor, which had hacked liable to the extent oi
£2OOO. This made Chalker crow, and he issued a
challenge to the world.
An accident produced the first trial for man-
slaughter, before Judge John Stephen and a mili-
tary jury. William Jaques was tried for slaying
John Stone, at Parramatta, and Hugh Taylor (father
of the late member for Parramatta), Joseph Hooking,
Thomas Barnett, Charles Blakefield and Janies
Hashen were up as accessories. Stone, a Crown
prisoner, had a fight with Jaques. There hau
been some bull-baiting on a field near the Grove
Inn, situated about where Auburn is now. John
Stone threw up his hat and challenged any man of
his weight, native or not. A purse of £5 vvas
made up around the ring, and Jaques accepted the
challenge. The fight ended in favor of Stone; but
before leaving the ringside he struck Jamies, which
caused another fight. In this Stone went down and
broke his skull; he died next day. The defence
was that Jaques struck in self-defence, and the jury
acquitted the lot. #
Unless Rod Heath will reconsider his
decision to stand Out of next Saturday’s N.S.W.-
Vic. tennis match in Melbourne, the Ma State should
be a winner. Its team includes H. Rice, Clark,
Marsh. Metcalf, Morgan and N. Peach, a solid crowd,
though not the best. On the Vic. side Heath had
been chosen in company with the O’Hara W ood
brothers, Campbell, Patterson and Raws. But the
selectors departed from the ancient custom of ap-
pointing the first singles player as captain, and
nominated Campbell. Heath felt hurt and dropped
out. R. Wertheim fills the gap.
* * * *
R. N. Williams, who defeated McLoughlin,
the American hero of the Davis Cup, by three straight
sets for the tennis championship of the United States,
has been licked for the college championship by an
unknown named Church.
Clem Hill has announced to the S.A.
Cricket Association his final retirement from the
game. For some years now he has kept out of
awav-from-home matches, and he has not been to
England since 1905, but on the Adelaide Oval he
lias played regularly, and S.A. will be badly hit by
losing him and Crawford together. Hill has had a
long innings since ho made 150 not out against
Stoddart’s team on his 18th birthday, and then
forced his way into the Australian XI of 1890 bv
making 200 against it for the Rest of Australia,
lie holds all sorts of records: highest score in Shield
matches, 365 not out against N.S.W.; first man to
make 1000 in an Australian season; most runs made
bv anvbody (on either side) in test matches. He
only made four “test” centuries, but his steady ill-
luck in getting out when he had scored 90-odd has
been notorious. Two matches, one in Melbourne
and one in Adelaide, he practically won for Aus-
tralia after six or seven men had gone cheaply.
There lias been any quantity of cricket in the family.
John Hill, the father, and a whole lot of brothers
have been up to inter-State form (Roy got as far as
being 12th man in a test-match), but Clem stood out
from the rest. He retires at 37 with the best left-
hander’s record in the world.
* * * *
“Masetto”: A propos Crockett’s no-balling
of Gent, of North Melbourne, in the match against
Fitzroy. J. O’Connor, who let the deliveries go
unquestioned, played with Hawksburn 20-odd years
ago. He was a most decided “thrower, but
met with little trouble from the junior
umpires. However, in the final match of the
1894-5 season (they were in the old Boyle and
Scott competition) Flynn and Cotter were given
charge, and the latter promptly “called ’ O Connor.
Twelve balls had been bowled (or otherwise), before
the over concluded, and O’Connor left the crease for
the remainder of the game. He must have changed
his action afterwards, as when he played in senior
ranks he passed all right. Crockett saw another
long* over in 1911, when he no-balled Pitcher (fatal
name) in the Victoria-South Africa match in 1911.
Eleven balls were sent down that time.
* * * *
.T. N. Crawford, late of S.A.. now
employed as a coach by Otago (M.L.) Cricket Asso-
ciation, did considerable damage at the opening ot
the season in Dunedin. Against Carisbrook A the
crack team in the competition, he bowled 66 balls
for 31 runs and six wickets. He just missed the hat-trick,
but got three wickets with four successive balls.
Most of his victims were clean bowled by his fast
stuff.
* * * *
The Vic. Cricket Association’s eyesight
test wasn’t all honey for the umpires. Only 16 were
awarded the possible 100 per cent., 88 were on the
66J- per cent, mark, four squeezed through at 33®
per cent., while three gained nary a point. Fancy
the hurricane efforts *of N.S.W. bowler A. Cotter
being at the mercy of one of those three!
Sid Sheaves looks like the hardest nut
for walkers to crack in the coming N.S.W. cham-
pionships. He has won five events in as many
weeks, and previous to picking up two champion-
ships at the South Sydney meeting was in receipt of
only ssec. in open competition from champion A. W.
Pickard. Other heel-and-toe battlers are invited to
scratch what consolation they can out of the fact
that Sheaves improves in style and pace at each
performance.
R, Woolnough. of Botany /Sydney) Har-
riers, at the recent club championships, won the
100yds. in 10 l-l'osec., 220yds. in 22 2-ssec, and
120yds. hurdles in 21sec. For a day’s outing of local
talent that’ll take some beating. y
The conclusion on Saturday of the fourth
round in the N.S.W. First-Grade Cricket scuffle found:
North Sydney, 1; Central Cumberland, 2 ; Waverley,
3 The others straggle down the line to Middle
Harbor, which lies at the bottom. University, last
year’s champion, is with Gordon at the fifth peg.
incidentally, it was against University that Padding-
ton won its first match (concluded Saturday) this
season. Noble cracked off 62 as his share in the
only innings he had, and was in so much like his old
form that only his enemies could tell the difference.
A week ago Waverley (last winter-cham-
pions at baseball) put up the game of its life and
defeated Leichhardt (last summer’s top-doggers) ; but.
on Saturday, Sydney arose like a refreshed David and
slew Goliath Waverley by five runs to three. Syd-
ney’s IX is composed of seven Yankees and two Aus-
tralians, arid the win was the result of excellent
pitching by Machado and wide-awake fielding by
brother Yanks. The other part of the programme
was the fall of St. George before Grosvenor (a club
composed of Rugby League footballers) by seven ru -
to six; while the howling dervishes from Leichhai.lt
beat Petersham bv If runs to two.
“Petrol”: The Tasmanian Automobile
Club set kindred bodies in the eastern States a
good example by running its annual reliability trials
The N.S.W. and Victorian clubs got the wai scale
‘badly, and abandoned everything, instead of trying to
keep matters normal. As the year ot the Automobile
Club (N.S.W.) ends on November 26, and the annual
meeting is listed for that date, it is hardly likcl>
that 1914 will see any more competitions, the new
tours committee of the club should, however, get to
work and arrange a conmetition for early in January.
What is wrong with a hill climb at National Paik.
The promotion of competitions will assist to liven
matters up for a trade which is feeling the pinch
badly. „ *
Westralian League of Wheelmen has lined
up with the other States, and an up-to-date track
will be built. There is an appearance of life in
cycling circles this season, and, as the Australasian
championships are to be split up between the six
bodies, the pedal-pushing business may be found on
its feet again.

The fumnal Melbourne-Sydney motor-cycle
reliability trial, which has been hanging in the bal-
ance ever since Kaiser \\ illy-At illy upset tlie rubbei
eo. that controlled last year’s event, has been defi-
nitely decided on. The trial is fixed for Christmas.
Every dog has its day. and so has every
motor-cycle. At the big N.S.W. Grand Prix meeting
the lightweight machines won both the Sydney-let-
holme reliability and the 140-mile speed event But
when it came to 24 hours’ solid going (chiefly on
bad roads) the big machines had it all their own
wav. Of 27 machines that started only eight did
the 398 mpes on time. Five of these were sixes,
two sevens and one eight horse-power. Five others—
four of them light machines —finished inside 244
hours.

N. S. Wales motorists do not intend to
quietly submit to the proposal to inflict a special tax
upon them, despite the statement that it is only
temporary.” The Automobile Club presented a
petition to Parliament last week in which it was
claimed that, if a tax must be imposed, it should be
on the volumetric capacity of the engines. To tax upon
either price or weight, the club contends, is to favor
American cars-and place the British product at a
disadvantage.
* * * *
N. S. Wales motorists are very
bitter concerning the Government’s intention
to regard as general revenue the £60,000
which will be raised. This money, thev sav,
should bo earmarked for the improvement of those
wildernesses of dust, ruts and bogs known as roads.
But the Holman management is so hard pushed for
monev that it refuses to regard the matter in this
light! so the motorists arc nnparentl” to he called
upon to pay for the calico slums in South Sydney,
or to make,good the deficit in some other brilliant
State undertaking.

R. .T. Short, who won the £lOO handicap
at Ballina (N.S.W.), last week, hurried down for the
Outrigger Handicap on the Parramatta on Saturday.
But H. Pickering was a trifle too good, and Short
went down by a length and a half. Still, he is an
improving sculler, and is likely to be found in the
championship class before long.

The Ornithological Association of R.A.
has been throwing light on the wastage of pigeons
that occurs whenever tlie favorite race, Oodnadatta-
to-Adelaide, is held—6oo-odd miles. Captain White,
who has been exploring lately in Centralia, says the
reason why so few pigeons get back home is that
thev are ieft without food and water on the train
journey up, so that on release they hang about food-
hunting, and are picked up by hawks. In fact, said
White, the whole race is a matter for the Prevention
of Cruelty to Animals people to look into.
From London: There has been hot con-
troversy as to whether racing and sports should be
run as though there was no war. Lord Roberts,
Conan Doyle and other exalted persons have sternly
called upon cricketers and footballers to cease play-
ing, and either go to the front or train for defence.
On the other hand, the King has expressed his Royal
wish that the neddies should run as usual. London
Evening News, whose Saturday football edition has
always enjoved a prodigious sale, has issued a pro-
clamation'that it will ignore the game until Ger-
many has been got in hand, and will publish no
more “football editions” until then—an announce-
ment which has brought the seriousness of the war
home to thousands of younsrsters in the most direct
fashion. Says the News: “This is no time for foot-
ball. This Empire has got to occupy itself with more
serious business.”
The Sydney Government House appeal
case was bumped out in London last week.
So many more important things have
occurred that it seems ages since enraged
importers used to land in Australia, and tell
how Imperialists abroad were so scandalised
oyer the proceedings that they intended to
withdraw from Australia and start afresh
in some less disloyal land. The dispute is
now seen in its right proportion. It boils
down to the facts that Henley, William
McLinen, and other corybantic patriots have
wasted a lot of time and oratory, and that
the Holman Administration has on its hands
an immense house, for which it has no use,
and which costs a considerable sum in up-
keep.

The Vic. State Labor Party enters this
election handicapped. The Argus has
“heartily endorsed the action of the P.L.C.
executive on the Education Act,” and whom
the Argus loves dies young.
“Harrison 0.”: “Vic” is furious (B.
22/10/T4) because a couple of monkeys at
Melbourne Zoo have been named Mr. and
Miss Maguire. “Vic” discerns in this an
insult to Oireland, since the Maguires were
once illustrious princes in Ulster. The
alleged insult seems to me to be the sincerest
form of blarney. The animals were not
named Jones, presumably, because there has
never been a King Jones, or even a Grand
Duke Jones. Does. “Vic” consider that the
Nosey Duke was insulted because an un-
fashionable boot was named after him? Or
Gladstone because his moniker was fixed to
a clumsy leather bag? There was recently
in these parts a performing ape called
George IV., and there is a blood-sweating
hippopotamus who bears the name of Brit-
ain’s Virgin Queen. Nobody heard any row
about either of these christenings. Every
visitor to Port Said has made the acquaint-
ance of Joseph Chamberlain, Lily Langtry
and other illustrious persons, represented by
donkeys ; and nobody has been known to raise
a howl of protest, even when Lilv has been
urged on by being prodded in the'ribs. Isn’t
it time.some of us dropped the silly habit of
assuming that other people are on the con-
stant watch for a chance to insult us? As
a matter of fact, most people are much too
busy considering themselves to give us even
the flicker of a thought.

The Inky Way.
Died the other day, at Newtown (Syd-
ney), Eliza Francis Walker, a daughter of
the George Howe who formerly ran the Tas-
manian Gazette, and grand-daughter of the
earlier George who was proprietor and editor
of the first newspaper— The Gazette —pub-
lished in Australia. This latter George Howe
was a native of St. Kitts (West Indies),
where his father was Government Printer.
, He came to Sydney in 1800, and was assisted
by Governor King to establish, under strict
censorship, the Sydney Gazette (March 19,
1803). He died in 1821 and was succeeded by
his son, Robert, who in January, 1829, was
drowned off Rock Island,. the then official
name for Pinchgut, now Fort Denison (Syd-
ney Harbor).
* * * *
Exit E. A. Potts, of Fitzroy (Vic.), a
tough old gentleman who, though blown up
in a mining explosion over 40 years ago, sur-
vived 25 years of the Argus, for which he
wrote most of the Fitzroy and Collingwood
news and pars about Councillor Squirt’s re-
joinder to Councillor Squibkins in the matter
of two penn’orth of cowheel accepted as a
bribe by the inspector of nuisances. The
explosion discounted Potts of one eye and
warned him off mining, but didn’t affect his
general activities. Thirty-five years ago he
was the father of “Potts’s baby”—a kidnap-
ped infant which was a Melbourne sensation
from its mysterious disappearance to the
time of its sensational discovery.
Maoriland has been raising a dust con-
cerning its official war correspondent who
will see little war. The Government appointed
Guy Scholefield, for years past London re-
presentative of a string of M.L. papers fav-
orable to the Government. The Opposition
papers promptly dug up the hatchet and
went after Massey, hurling at him the ex-
ample of the Australian Government, which
handed over the selection to the Journalists’
Association. This seems to show that M.L.
proprietors are beginning to withdraw their
ill-considered hostility to the M.L. Jour-
nalists’ Association. Scholefield is a con-
scientious young man, who, of course, has
written a book. At latest Premier Massey
was standing under the white flag, promising
to arrange for a square deal from the Front
by the war correspondent who’ll never get
there.
“Y.Z.”: Have you noticed the pathetic
failure of the efforts of the black-and-white
artists on the big London illustrateds when
in 1914 they tackle war subjects? How the
flagrant melodrama jars! No doubt war is
flagrant melodrama in patches, and the
artists may argue that they are giving those
particular patches. But they can’t con-
vince us. These drawings of horsemen tear-
ing madly athwart the landscape in an
atmosphere of smoke dotted with explosions
strike us as old-fashioned and over-done. The
camera has spoiled business for the war
artist who draws his stirring scenes of blood
and brutality in a studio in Chelsea. When
you get a camera picture of war it is com-
paratively calm. If you are shown a great
gun in action, you have no idea what its aim
is, the party at whom it is hurling a ton of
ironmongery being somewhere in the next
county. On the other hand, the war artist
must have the hurtling limbs and flying
fragments distinctly outlined in the middle
distance. Of course combatants do show
some excellent in-fighting now and again, but
in a general way the blood-and-thunder of
the Caton Woodfields strikes a false note in
a day when we understand war more as deep
calling unto deep.

ROLLIN’ DOWN!
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I sez this day ter Billo Jones the Kaiser's gettin’ fits;
Us Belgian crow is dyin’ down; in France he’s
gone to bits;
An’ in this mornin’s paper there’s a lovely bit o’
news
That makes a genooine Britisher upheave in wild
hurroos;
It sez the River Vistooler is rollin’ down the dead
That fell on Polish battlefields when Bear was
seein’ red;
Fer, close to Warsaw-town,
There’s thousands rollin’ down—
-0 readers! It’s a pleasant sight to see ’em Rollin’
Down.
Our daily is a gentle thing. It cannot stomach
slumps.
The day we don’t cut up a corps it gets a fit oi
dumps.
The week we lost a cruiser it was blue an’ blazin’
mad,
An’, w’en it talked of Kaiser Bill, it christened
him a cad.
But w’en it kem this mornin’ it was gay an’ full
o’ cheer,
An’ hollers to the public: “Get yerself a pint o’
beer!”
For Warsaw’s lookin’ down,
And watchin’ foemen drown—-
O readers! Tis a pleasant sight to see ’em Rollin’
Down!
There’s some as take their pleasure down the Bay
or on the Block ;
There’s some as like to liquidate or contemplate the
frock ;
The push they get their fill o’ fun by gazin’ on the
bash,
And Percival Augustus is a demon on the mash;
But “dailies” is a solemn lot, above such games as
these—
The times are gone when lookin’ on at simple sport
could please.
Such things they make ’em frown;
But, when our foemen drown,
They smile a sweet, contented smile, to see ’em
Rollin’ Down,
By Warsaw’s ancient town,
By battered walls an’ brown —
O readers! ’Tis a pleasant sight to see ’em Rollin’
Down !

Dividends are still some distance off, and
when they do come there will be nothing
brilliant about them, on the present look ot
things. When it fell into the soup (which
it did when it was very young) the co. had
over f 200,000 of liabilities (£175.069 owing
to depositors and £44.392 to the bank). It
made various arrangements with its crcdi-
tors, and eventually it was agreed, among
other things, that no dividend should be paid
until the last depositor had been boiyed oft
the premises, and the arrears of interest
swept out in a lump. According to the
agreement, the last of the principal should
be paid back in February, 1917, and the
interest (at 3 p.c.) in February, 1919. I his
shows the preparations that are being made
for the ceremony:—

Property alone stands at £24,558; 12 months
ago it was £37,183. Fortunately, most of
the money that has lately come in from sales
has gone into the safe. For the present, no
further business of any consequence can be
done; though Queensland isn’t suffering
from the effects of drought o'r war to the
same extent as some States, this isn’t the
time when there’s enough launching-out to
make a brisk property market. Still, the
society has another few years to run before
the last curse comes home to roost, and even
now it has £II,OSS in cash towards the re-
paying of £19,803 of deposits, etc. If the
properties (£24,558) and advances, etc.
(£46,987), are worth book value, then the
co.’s 10s. shares are represented by 13s. 4d.
worth of assets, after providing for liabilities.
But, as remarked above, no div. can be paid
for five years; and then it is likely to be a
small one unless there happens to be a brisk
market for suburban allotments; and The
Bulletin’s own idea of the prospects of a
suburban allotment boom in the near future
is unprintable.

That £5OO written off goes to a sort of con-
tingency reserve, which with this addition
will amount to £4300. The directors, having
decided that the pub property stands in the
books at a fair thing while the licenses are
alive, are now making provision for the
shrinkage that would follow should any of
the licenses be scrapped; and this fund is
there to stand that loss. Pub property is
valued at £20,189. Compensation must be
paid on the closing of a pub; and that
amount added to the reserve just mentioned
ought to pretty well cover any shrinkage
caused by delicensing £20,189 worth of pubs.
Also it must always be remembered that the
delicensing of one pub adds to the value of
its neighbor. During the half-year rents
brought in £llO2, which more than pays
the 10 p.c. dividend, leaving the balance as
well as the direct profit from the beer-
foundry to go to visible reserves. The latter
now exceed the capital (£14,375). It is a
very cheerful position to be in, especially as
the dividend on the moderate capital calls
for only £719 per annum. Plant and rolling
stock are kept very well written down, and
if the rent return is anything to go by the
hotel property is not in at more than its
present real value. Other than a mortgage
of £6500, the only liabilities are £1834
owing to sundry creditors. On the other
side there are £5113 of book debts and
£2020 of cash. Altogether a nice cosy little
corner. Next year’s figures may not be so
comfortable; but the depression will only be
temporary. It would take more than a
drought and a war to permanently disable
Australia’s thirst.

There is room for population at Oberon
(N.S.W.). Good agricultural and pastoral
land is lying around loose; yet a few sheep,
a little ‘farming, and some fruit gathered
from trees planted by the grandfathers of
the present generation about complete the
situation. If it rains enough, and it gener-
ally does, they get fair crops; if it doesn t
they curse the climate and exist somehow
until next year. In addition to its pastoral
and agricultural resources, in minerals its
hen-scratched surface has already given pro-
mise of a collection few districts outside N.
Queensland can produce. Of the multitu-
dinous shows worked, a few have been pay-
able ; others have been duffers, and some
of them ingenious frauds. But there are
manv that, if tackled by people with experi-
ence in modern mining processes —more
especially those pertaining to fine gold—
would yield satisfactory results. In the
mining connection there are signs of. a pos-
sible awakening, as I ictorian parties are
already in evidence at Breakfast Creek and
Mount Gossan, and where one Victorian
goes others generally follow.

unless stamps accompany.
Flinders Street: No corporation can bring
an action of libel for a statement which reflects
upon itself but on its members or officials only. -
statement imputing misconduct to a corporation,
which it cannot be guilty, does not give the corpo
ration a cause of action. The corporation in question
cannot be guilty of the acceptance of secret commis-
sions, since it may safely be presumed that the ms ru-

defamatory matter imputed to it acts or conduct of

capable Michael Doolan: It is Futurist P°etry
an advanced nature.... Gouger: Military rules bloc
it A. Alexander: Good for Bundarra ! D. 8..
Hardly enough in them... -8.N.J.: Not permis-
sible at present....Mingidee: Far too long-winded.
Spraggs: “That's Me” is the story that set the
Wandering Jew in motion to escape its eternal
reiteration. .. .F. Grey: Sheep-shearing records for
Australia are (bar argument): Hand, 321; machine,
336 ..Jones: Don’t know; borrowing two detectives
and a bloodhound to find 0ut....A German: You
write gloomily: “We do not expect Australians to
love us, but we expect them to treat us decently, as
any honorable nations will treat prisoners of war.
What’s the trouble? Has any well-behaved German
been indecently or dishonorably treated in Australia,
and if so by whom? W.J.: A’our legal name is
your registered name—in your case, your father s
name.... Lola G.: Graceful, but you say nothing
new R.M.V.: Why persist in shovelling rubbish
this way? The stuff you are doing is no good, and
you ought to know it....M.A.: Praiseworthy efTort,
but a hit young. Try one of the papers that run a
young folks’ page Resigned: Another contributor
pounced on that topic a week ago... .1.R.W.: Poorl>
told, and the point is too small, anyway M.J.P.:
Duly conveyed to the basket.... Wowser: Leap,
Wowser! leap with care! Don’t you know any better
yarns than that? Bellerive: A severely-domestic
lyric (and we hope there’s no libel in it) :
THE COBWEB.
Upon my bedroom ceiling
A cobweb I did spy,
Upon which did cling a spider
A-waiting for a fly ;
I stood upon a table
And with the aid of a broom
I swept away the cobweb
From the ceiling of the room.
i... P.G.: Your dogs can’t bark in these columns
D.K.M.: The German host is not now “garbing itself
in the cloak of war.” It has been wearing the gar-
ment for so many weeks that we almost cease to
remember that it ever wore anything else S.T.S.:
You are very cheerful in bad verse... .C.V.T.: Trifling
verse-blither Miss E. G.: Poem is really very
dull prose Henry P. (V.): Vision couldn’t have
been inspired. It reads like a cocoa advt.....C.
Ross P.: Try one of the other weeklies. Bit out of
our line Percy T. (V.): Both fail Fred T.
(Q.): Good theme; but, as you tell it, the story
reads monotonously.... Paddy-M.: An article covered
that topic. But the verses would have gone out,
anyhow J.H.8.: It was a bright-eyed, clear-
skinned young man who fell into the basket....
F.M.J.: They merely promise.... E.W. It.: Aon appeal
in your tender, womanly way to W ilhelm to put a
bullet through his brain. Write him direct Fred
S. P.: It makes no appeal here. Aon might possibly
place it elsewhere E.G.C.: “Herewith lam for-
warding you a short poem.” Your mistake. .. .Elsa
M. G.: The poem falls over its own feet in quite a
remarkab': way. The refrain helps to trip it up....
Proud Father: Father of what?. .. .Bill S.: —
Kaiser Bill in War Lord rags,
And heavenly Power Attired,
Called A r on Moltke, and said, “My boy,
I regret to say, You’re tired.”

A.W.T.: Try again in five years’ time. .. . J.L.:
Dreadful art. Take it away and roast your chestnuts
elsewhere.... J.A.P.: Scratches... .Rupert E.: > ery
large and very bad. If you can't manage to make
them better, could you make them a little smaller?
.... Frank F. F.: Second-class idea —third-class treat-
ment. . . .P.H.: Poor jest and a very stiff drawing
Elmes: (1) Are the old ladies dressed in wood?
(2) Is the booking-clerk a maniac? (3) Have you
just heard that story? D.M.R.: Forced humor, and
you surely didn’t do the drawing of your own
free will? P.E.: Do try to improve; it's no good
sending stuff of that calibre. .. .R. Barrard: No demand
for “Cobra” pictures. The firm which advertises the
goods supplies its own pictures.... G. Mills: No room
for new and inefficient artists to butt into the Sundry
Shows page. Incidentally, you are very inefficient.
The “patriotism” 0 f a ]i these hucksters is
no good ; it stops when they’ve got the advt.
they are after. Two Australians have
established a knitting factory at Clifton
Hill (Vic.), and only the other day, when
the sacred duty of stocking Australian
manufactures was being shrieked by all the
calico jimmies of the South, two big Mel-
bourne retailers told the knitting-goods’
traveller that they “wouldn’t stock Aus-
tralian goods.” They didn’t want to see
samples either. “The high Australian wages
were enough, without going further into the
matter.” Yet these people sell imported
stuff at prices based on the high Australian
wages. Hucksters cannot be made really
patriotic by talk. Prohibitive duties are the
only effective argument.
“0.K.”: Now that a Totalisator Commis-
sion is so badly needed for the hospitals, and
State Governments are talking further taxa-
tion to meet drought-c«m-war circumstances,
it is fairly up to the Labor parties in
N.S.W. and Vic. to disprove the popular
allegation that Ikey Mo. the bookmaker, has
got them in “the bag.” How otherwise
explain their inaction, when in Victoria, at
any rate, the definite promise of a Tote Bill
would carry the Labor party into power at
the coming elections? The odds offered on
Melbourne Cup day were the joke of the
multitude, and thousands of country punters
went back home with stories of how they
backed winners at less than even the
beggarly prices quoted in the press or lost
their money on “seconds” which would have
paid a decent dividend in a Tote.

Don’t continue to suffer needlessly. Get well the “Wincarnis”
way—the quick, sure and safe way to health. There is
nothing to eoual “Wincarnis” for Anaemia, Weakness, Nerve
Trouble, Sleeplessness, Exhaustion, Fatigue, Depression, or

“W incarnis” is a Tonic, a Restorative, a Bloodmaker and a
Nerve Food —all in one. It creates new strength, new vigor,
new blood, new nerves and new life. And the benefit begins
from even the first wineglassful. You can actually feel it
doing you good. You can feel it dancing through your veins
like a stream of new life. “Wincarnis” is recommended by over
10,000 Doctors, because it is the only Wine Tonic of any
repute that does not contain drugs. Therefore you are safe
in taking

By T. C. WOLLASTON.
PRICE FIVE SHILLINGS.
Ist Edition, JUNE, ’l4.
2nd Impression, SEPTEMBER, ’l4
This artistic book of 22S pages
measures x inches. It contains
five full-page illustrations in color, and
six in black and white. Handsomely
blocked in gold and attractively boxed.
Price 5/-, or 5/4 post free.
This is a book such as is rarely met
with and one which is rapidly making
new friends. Australian children will
welcome “The Spirit of the Child,
because it will amuse and interest them.
It was written for them by an Austra-
lian father, and is sure to please, Read
this Review, and judge for yourself:
This is a beautiful book. Not merely in print-
ing and binding and general effect. The thougl*
is beautiful, and the expression of the thought
moves with beautiful grace. Here is nothing
patronising or adroitly shallow; not the easy
confidence of the expert, but the serene, deep con-
fidence of ripe comprehension that has realised
itself untarnished. The book purports to be a
collection of letters written to his children by a
father on his travels. He writes naturally, with
an unfailing, tender reverence. His love of nature
is a real thing that glows on every page. There
is nothing namby-pamby about the letters, Ihey
are written to intelligent children who can think
in good English. The genuinely bewitching illus-
trations help the story. The good effect of the
opening’ pages is delicately sustained throughout.
There is nothing that jars in the book. An
amazing thing. ... , . , - ,
The book is delightfully fresh and singular and
sweet, and lam enthusiastic about it. Get it for
vour children if you do not want it for yourself.

IN BANANA LAND
A few nights ago German residents of
Brisbane entertained certain people at a ban-
quet to celebrate the fall of Antwerp.
Nobody protested. Easy-going Australian
authority, if it took any notice of the inci-
dent, appears to have merely shrugged its
shoulders and remarked that it was good for
trade.
The last two years constitute a record for
the Queensland Labor party in that during
the period not one member has been ex-
pelled. In the previous years 25 members
had to leave. But that was before the party
realised that an Opposition which was always
expelling itself could never expel the Govern-
. ment.
r Edmund Jowett, of Kymina (N.Q.), writes
■ tp the Brisbane press that his two sons who
were at Cambridge have obtained commissions
in the Northumberland Fusiliers. According
to Jowett, “practically every Australian in
England at the beginning of the war joined
or tried to join the army.” Not much “lean-
ing against a post” about that record !
Home Sec. Appel was crushed under a ton
of froth the other day. On the Government’s
Electoral Bill Labor-leader Ryan had pro-
posed an amendment designed to give depart-
ing soldiers a chance to record their votes.
“Why,” Said tlie too-literal Appel, “some of
the men will probably be dead before their
votes can be recorded!” Quick came Ryan’s
retort: “And would you rob a dead soldier
of his vote!” If Ryan had tried for a year
he couldn’t have got off anything frothier;
and yet it will probably have more effect
than two Hansards’ full of hard argument.
Appel, anyway, collapsed, and his colleagues
withered him with their looks.
The collapsing joke of Bananaland’s poli-
tics, the Liberal Association, which has been
slowly dying for some years, has handed in
its obituary notice, dated November 9. Almost
a year ago it was perishing on its feet, but
recovered sufficiently to send round 400
circulars asking for a fresh lease of life.
When it received only seven replies it suf-
fered a relapse. However, Denham came to
the rescue—under circumstances that have
since given him many an unpleasant half-
hour in Parliament. Now his pet Ass. is
on its deathbed, and his own political
pulse is so feeble .that he couldn’t hold out
his hand for another rescue.
“Albion”: Re the Hornet Bank massacre
aqd the death of William Fraser (B.
12/11/’l4). It was Sylvester, William’s
young brother, who escaped from the' station
after the blacks’ visit. When struck by one
of the niggers Sylvester rolled between the
bed and the wall. The abos. thought he was
dead, and left it at that. On regaining con-
sciousness the youngster, (aged 11) caught
a horse and escaped to the nearest neighbor’s.
William was at Ipswich at the time, but
joined in the subsequent hunt —the most san-
guinary that Queensland ever saw.
After the overwhelming Federal Labor
vote cast in Bananaland this year,
Denham’s Government isn’t looking for-
ward to the State elections with undue
ardor. As a precautionary movement
a new Disfranchise Bill has been intro-
duced. Under it a would-be elector may
have to answer 16 questions, any irregu-
larity being met with a pole-axe. This edu-
cation test may keep a few thousand Labor
voters off the rolls. The 12-months’ residence
Clause is also confirmed —and that won’t be
good for a few thousand shearers and wan-
dering workmen.
“Cleveland”: “W.” (B. 22/10/’l4) tells
the untruth when he says that the decrease
in the output of bananas' in N.Q. is due
solely to the operations of- the Heathen
Chinee. Here’s a truer Solution of the
trouble. Some four years ago disastrous
cyclones and floods destroyed 80 per cent,
of _ the banana plantations round about
Cairns, Innisfail and Mourilyan: and then,
to help a staggered industry,. Sydney and
Melbourne markets. were (and still are)
flooded with coolie-grown fruit from Fiji.
This was carried across in a vessel with
special arrangements for storing at just the
right temperature, and that steamship ser-
vice is subsidised by the Federal Govern-
ment. On the other hand, the N.Q. fruit (10
days on the ship from Cairns to Sydney, and
14 to Melbourne) is handled and stowed in
a manner _ to cause shippers acute dipso-
mania, while the temperatures of the holds,
except in a few cases, doesn’t seem
to be anyone’s business. Also, the bananas
may be stowed with timber, hides, ores,
tallow and bilgewater. On arrival at Sydney
or Melbourne every banana that shows signs
of ripening is torn off and not allowed to land,
and the banana that is not nearly ripe, after
10 or 14 days of the above treatment, is a
curiosity.
The Tory press recently brayed over the
seventh consecutive surplus and the prosper-
ous state of Bananaland under Tory rule.
Treasurer Barnes claims to be £lO,OOO on
the right side, but to get that £lO,OOO he had
to add to revenue £236,000 derived from land
sales and £60,000 from timber sales. If that
hadn’t been sufficient to tip up the beam he
could have disposed of a feAV more hundred
acres of Crown lands. In any case there are
no cheers due to a Government Avhich can
show only £lO,OOO surplus in a seven-year
period during which £12,000,000 of loan
money has been spent. The most hopeless
Government in the world couldn’t spend mil-
lions on public Avorks without temporarily
boosting its railway revenue, for instance.
Fihelly, M.L.A., the other evening ga.ve
the Queensland Assembly some cold facts
regarding seven loans which reach maturity
next year. In every case very much more
than the loan itself has been paid in interest,
and a larger amount than Avas received re-
mains to be paid. Thus one loan, raised in
1875, was £1,549,630. On that £2,644,668
has been paid in interest, and it will cost
£1,695,300 to square the bill. In all, the
State got £10,912,514 from the paAvnbroker;
£16,529,224 has been paid in interest, and
£11.728,500 will have to be found next year.
It is like a man borrowing sixpence to buy
himself a drink, and, in return, pledging
himself to go on buying drinks for his credi-
tor for the rest of his life, and the life of
his descendants even to the tenth generation.
THE PROSPECT OF A FIRE .
FIRST LOST EXPLORER : “This is our dead finish , Bill.”
SECOND DITTO : “ Yes. And what a consolation it is to think that we've both lead
terribly wicked lives.”
Arthur Feez, K.C., appeared, fully horse-
haired, at the bar of the House the other day
to object to the Co-operative Sugar Works
Bill. The last time the. Queensland House
was invaded by Costs in this fashion was
half a century ago, when Judge Lutwyche
protested agairist the importation of a Chief
Justice from England. Liitwyche’s protest
was bumped out —and the thing may be an
omen.
“N.Q.’: This is how Bananaland’s Depart-
ment of Agriculture assists 'the Northern
settler. From a State nursery it supplies
him with fruit trees at nominal prices. This
would be a great help towards a livelihood —
if the seedlings didn’t produce indifferent re-
sults- or no-results at ail at fruiting age. A
few years back the planting of 500 rubber
trees meant, it was said, a sure competency,
and the Department was rushed by customers
for 10,000. I haven’t heard of a Queensland
rubber baron yet. In fact, I haven’t heard
of as much as one settler making bread and
treacle out of rubber. Similar fortunes were
promised from sisal hemp. Vanilla is now
the boom, £6O per acre being quoted as the
return; but I’d rather somebody else helped
me to get it.
QUEENSLAND GOSSIP.
Brisbane, November 14, 1914.
My Dear Thargomindaii, —
The Governor-General, Lady Helen and
Lady Doris Blackwood, with our old fanii-
liar gentleman-help, Captain Eoxton, arrived
on Friday night. Hundreds of citizens were
at the unloading platform, but thousands
stayed at home, or just leaned over the bar
as if beer were of more importance than
Governors, and the barman a person requir-
ing more watching than a gentleman-help.
This is what comes of free and compulsory
education, my dear. It Avas a consolation to
observe the hearty and loyal manner m
Avhich the Lieut, or morganatic Governor,
the fur-decorated Mayor, Colonel George
Lee, Commander Curtis and others of the
old nobility grasped the hand of the King s
substitute. The \dsitors are at Government
House, the Arthur Morgans having gone
back to their own moated grange.
N. S. Wales Minister Trefle and his Avife
were on the lawn at Ascot on Wednesday,
the feminine part of the combination Avear-
ing faAvn-colored charmeuse a'nd a most
becoming hat. They tea-ed Avith the O’Sheas
and Mrs. White, of Pikedale. The races
were well attended again to-day, amongst
the sinners being the Gov.-General and his
Avife.
The vacancy in the Australian Governors’
Union caused by the retirement of Wee
Macgregor is about to be filled. Major Sir
Hamilton John Goold-Adams is the new
member. He has a fine record as a soldier,
which leads me to remark that it is a pity
to waste him. He was with the Becliuana-
land Expedition in ’B4, commanded a field
force in the Matabele scuffle, and fought in
the last Boer war. He was Lieutenant-
Governor of the Orange River Colony for
six years, and in 1907 was made a full-'
fledged Governor. In 1910 he left- South
Africa, and since 1911 has been High Com-
missioner for Cyprus, which nominally
belonged to the Unspeakable Turk until a
few days ago, when J. Bull pushed him off,
A characteristically-masculine department
issued £l5 to each nurse attached to the
Australian Military Hospital. Incidentally
the Nightingales have to provide their beds
and bedding and mess outfits out of this
sum. To add to the expense, the grey home-
spun, which usually is made into uniforms
for nurses, was not procurable in Australia,
so grey serge suiting had to be used. The
uniforms include the dress itself, a cape, and
a long coat with cape attached. The preva-
lent male idea that a couple of pounds
should clothe any woman from head to heel
should be exploded by now. These uniforms
alone cost more than the £l5 allowed by the
Government, and the nurses either had to
go bedless and eat with their fingers or else
be out of pocket. This was particularly
hard since none of them were allowed to
take private cases for three weeks prior to
being enrolled. The Johnsoniafi Club
handed over £5 apiece to the Queensland
nurses, and another fund is growing. But
it seems rather a pity that women who are
going out to serve their country are dragged
before the public like a hard-luck, charity-
hunting show.
The Lady Lamington Hospital is losing its
popular matron, Miss Ralston. She has been
bitten by the war germ, and is to go with
the hospital. On Wednesday the committee
murmured its regrets and filled the lady’s
capable arms with such mementoes as a
writing-case, a camera, and a gold-mounted
fountain-pen.
Nurse Marion Dalrymple has been fare-
welled, too. On Tuesday Muriel Bourne
entertained about 20 girleens in her honor,
and during a hesitation between tea and cake
Mrs. J. J. Graham presented the about-to-
leave with a few items that merely hinted
at the extent of the friendly relations.
On Thursday afternoon a set of brass and
pipe band instruments were presented to the
second Queensland Expeditionary Force.
Lt.-Colonel Cannan welcomed the Arthur
Morgans, Digby Denham, Opposition-leader
Ryan, the Speaker and a fair sprinkling of
the youth and beauty of the city.
The members of the sth Light Llorse gave
themselves and their very best girls a river
trip on the Koopa on Thursday. There was
unlimited soldier, a band, a nicely-polished
moon, things to eat, and-I—well, 1 —well, it was a very
popular picnic.
On Wednesday all the officers (naval and
military) laced themselves into their most-
trimmed uniforms, and went to see “The
Toreador.” After the first act James Love
auctioned a red ensign, recently retrieved from
the Germans. It was a snowball auction,
which means “Don’t talk unless you mean
it” —on every bid the bidder has to pay up.
Altogether £291 was realised for the Patriotic
Fund, and then the auctioneer and Alan
Corrie divorced themselves of another £4 10s.
each to 1 make a level £3OO. Squatter E. G.
Blume got the bit of bunting. He bought it
three times altogether, the last time for £6O.
Hugh Buckler and Violet Paget had a
reception at the Cafe Eschenhagen oh Friday.
All our Very Best were there. The Paget
was, as usual, the best-dressed of the gather-
ing, her draperies being something in taffetas
that was blue, shot with gold. To-night the
co. opened at Palace Gardens. The house
(or, rather, enclosure, since it has no roof)
was packed, and the final curtain had to be
rolled up again to let Mr. Buckler come out
and talk.
Died last Saturday, Mrs. Edwards, wife
of the member for Oxley in the first Federal
Parliament. Her life was full of kindly
deed§.
Yours affectionately,
AUSTRALIA JANE.
Some districts give honor where honor is
due. Atherton, in the North, which only
started making . butter a few years ago,
already turns out 20 tons a month, and sees
its fortune founded on fat. Consequently
when a carnival was held the other day in
aid of the Patriotic Fund and the question
arose, “Who should lead the procession?”
the district’s choicest heifer wrs sent to the
.hairdresser’s, and the „ proud queen then
stepped it out before them all.
Word comes across from /Papua of the
murder of J. T. Mclntosh, one of the best-
known of Northern prospectors. His finest
job for Papua was the discovery of Laloki,
the copperfield which some day is going to
make Port Moresby several degrees livelier.
At present heavy freight charges stand in
the way. The proposal to build a railway
is, nevertheless, to fall through; but a road
fit for motor traffic may be laid down in-
stead. Mclntosh, having sold out at Laloki,
wis prospecting up towards Lakekamu when
he fell in with some “bad” niggers. Three
of them arff in custody, and tlije district is
goifig to- be unhealthy for them presently.
One reason why the • Laborites of New-
castle (N.S.W.) demanded that prison work
should be abolished, and- confinees made a
•useless tax on the community, was that
certain bricklayers in bonds are building a
gaol wall, while free bricklayers are unem-
ployed. A gaol wall is needful but it isn’t
profitable, and while so many hundreds of
remunerative factories require building, this
gaol construction seems a poor sort of thing
for a proud, free citizen to hanker after.
When a State is going to bankruptcy at the
rate of £700,000 or £BOO,OOO a month through
excess of imports' and insufficiency of local
industry, there is surely a factory-building
job available somewhere.

HALF-YEARLY REPORT of the Directors of the BANK OF AUSTRALASIA,
With the Accounts for the Half-year to 13th April, 1914.
Presented to the Proprietors at theH pearly Genera! Meeting, held on Thursday,
report.
mu- Directors submit to the Proprietors the Balance-sheet as at 13th April last, with
1 for the half-year to that date. After providing for rebate on bills
the liofit: AccAustralasian rates and taxes, and after making provision for bad
the net profit for the half-year amounted to
‘“itifL must be added £30,168/19/2 brought forward from the previous half-
£264 065/17/6, out ot which the directors have declared a Divi-

Bonus' at Jat/of 3 per cent, per annum, or 12/- per share, together £3/8/- per share,
forward to the next account. Owing to the general dislocation of business, and the
financial stringency caused by the war, the Directors think it prudent not to make the
customarv appropriations out of the half-year’s profits to the Reserve Fund and
Bank Premises but to carry forward the whole available balance, which can be dealt
with hereafter in such manner as may be considered expedient. 0
The Dividend and Bonus will be payable, in London and in Australasia, on the 2nd

We have examined the cash and securities in London, and the London books, and have verified the
transfers from the several branches in the Commonwealth and New Zealand, and we beg to report that, in
our opinion, the foregoing is a full and fair balance-sheet of the bank, and that it exhibits a true and
correct view of the state of the bank’s affairs, as shown by the books. The investments are valued at
market price or under.

“The Standard History of the War” is
the great authoritative account. Not only
are the land battles and the Naval engagements
adequately explained by Military and Naval
Experts, and clearly illustrated by diagrams
and unique photographs, but the failure of
the Diplomatists is fully and reliably treated
in this magnificent History. It is all so
carefully written that Historians will use
it for reference.

“0.K.”: A recent Bulletin complained
that, wliemas Australian wine-growers pro-
duced a lot of the wine-lees from which
cream of tartar is made, there is no local
manufacture of the substance. As a matter
of fact, the total Australian production of
wine-lees does not suffice for more than a
tenth of the cream of tartar which this coun-
try consumes in baking powders, etc. Five to
six tons of lees (representing 50,000 to 100,000
gallons of wine) are required for one ton of
cream of tartar; and there are not very
many hundred thousand gallons of wine made
in Australia. However, such raw material
as we produce is worked up at Felton-
Grimwade’s factory in Melbourne. Some
years ago Mr. Russell Grimwade went
around to the vineyardists of N.S.W., Vic.
and S.A., and taught them to save their
wine-lees. He took all they would send him,
and put it through a slower process than
European manufacturers employ, with the
result that cream of tartar made in Mel-
bourne is actually the purest on the Aus-
tralian market. Unfortunately the produc-
tion is small, and is not growing much ; in
fact, the factory is getting no more lees than
it dried five years ago, although the senders
are now asking £3O for what they formerly
sold at a “tenner.” As the pioneer of an
industry, Mr. Grimwade deserves much more
raw material than he gets. All the same, if
every wine-grower rushed him with lees the
output of tartrate would still be insufficient.
Australia has no extent of vineyards to speak
of, and never will have until the people
acquire a taste for their own grape joys.
“Coot”: Judge Hodges (Vic.) gave a par-
ticular executor a shock the other day,
incidentally, gave trustees generally some
very interesting legal advice. This especial
trustee was empowered under a will to draw
a commission. The Court, as is usual, fixed
the commission at 5 per cent. In addition
to the commission the trustee, who was
an agent, claimed the right to retain about
£lOO he had pocketed, being the usual 15 per
cent, insurance brokerage allowed him by
insurance companies for giving them the
business; likewise about £5O, being the bonus
of 10 per cent, granted on premiums. The
other trustee, a company—a company has no
bowels—challenged his right to appropriate
£l5O. Notwithstanding the agent’s plea
that the 15 per cent, commission was a usual
arrangement with an agent, and must have
been paid by the estate if any other agent
were employed, Hodges descended on him
like a ton of hard-boiled horsehoofs. The
bonus of 10 per cent, on premiums, he
declared, was not a commission payable to
an agent at all, but a recognised deduction
from premiums to which owners were en-
titled. As to the 15 per cent., he declared
emphatically, and Hodges can be decidedly
emphatic, that a trustee is not allowed to
make any profit out of his office. If a will
grants him commission, well and good, but
he is not at liberty to permit his duty and
private interest to conflict. The agent and
trustee left the court mad enough to eat his
grandmother raw.

Of 244 samples of milk (etc.) officially
taken in Wellington (M.L.) during the past
12 months 48 contained added water and
three failed the tests otherwise. The aver-
age of adulteration was 8 per cent. Says
M.L. chief-chemist McLaurin :
Taking the annual consumption of milk in Wel-
lington as 2,000,000ga15., and assuming the samples
to be fairly representative, then 31,600ga15. of water
of uncertain quality were sold as milk during the
year. At 4d. per quart this represents £2106.
Deduct £Bl recovered in fines and costs in the 22
cases in which proceedings were taken, there remains
a clear profit of over £2OOO for the vendors of
watered milk.
The robbery is bad enough, but it isn’t the
worst part of the trade. How many chil-
dren are murdered annually by having this
adulterated milk fed to them? The next
magistrate who has a milk-adulteration case
before him might ask himself that question
before handing out a fine of 10 or 15 shil-
lings.
A RHYME OF BAFFLED THIEVES.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Baffled Thieves.”— Evening paper poster, trumpet-
ing the usual attempt at plain burglary.
The honest man steps out with pride,
His little kit-bag by his side;
His watch is chained down to his chest;
His coins in safe, deep pockets rest.
His bank account
Of large amount
Is watched by lynx-eyed men.
Thus battened down,
He goes to town
To baffle thieves again.
His cheap revolver in a drawer
At home is ready loaded for
The masked and muffled ruffian who
Will creep the open window through;
But, strange to say,
lie stays away,
While rowdy tradesmen shout,
And, ’cause they must,
For some large trust
Rob him in turn about.
The honest man, while on his feet,
Bewails the rising price of meat;
But he will sigh: “God’s will be done!”
If he who robs conceals his gun.
He cannot stand
The sharp command
By someone masked and armed;
But put the screw
On him and you
We’ll see lie’s not alarmed.
The honest man each day believes
That he has baffled many thieves ;
All’s well with him and his conceit
If no one from his swollen feet
Tears off his boots,
Or madly shoots
Him in the spreading vest,
In haste insane
To steal his chain.
He is the Trust Thief’s jest!

A clear complexion, soft white
hands and luxuriant tresses
follow the use of Rexona Skin
and Facial Soap. To restore
skin beauty first apply Rexona
with gentle anointing, then con-
tinue the treatment by daily
washing with Rexona Soap. A
clean scalp and soft, glossy hair
result from the regular use of
Rexona Soap as a hair-wash.
“I have been using
Rexona Skin and Facial
Soap, and wish to add
my testimony about
same. It is a wonder-
ful Soap for the skin
and hair, and I cannot
imagine how I ever
got along without it
before. It keeps the
skin in perfect condi-
tion, and is so delight-
ful to use; and for my
hair I never had any-
thing like it, for it
makes it soft and
glossy and keeps it in
perfect condition.
“I shall never be
without Rexona Soap,
and will recommend it
to all my friends, for I
am sure they will like
it.”
(Signed)

THE REXONA HABIT.
A habit formed is hard to break. Bad habits are easily formed, but good habits can be attained
almost as easily. The Rexona habit results in health and beauty, and once formed will never be broken.
There are two Rexona habits—that of using Rexona Ointment to heal all injuries to the skin,
and the Rexona Soap
habit, which consists of
keeping’ oneself clean and
pure with a delicately
scented and medicated
soap. Rexona Ointment
and Rexona Soap mean
skin health and beauty,
comfort to the user, and
immunity from disease.
So form the Rexona habit.
Start with a Is. cake of
Rexona Soap and a Is. 6d.
pot of Ointment. Soon
you will be glad to know
that Rexona Soap is put
up in dainty boxes .con-
taining three cakes each,
and that Rexona Ointment
is also sold in larger size
triangular pots, contain-
ing nearly four times the
quantity of the Is. 6d.
size, which are sold at 3s.
each.

“And no doubt about it,” says the man of the house, as
he finishes the first helping and looks round to see if
there is any more coming.
And if you haven’t yet introduced
“Rex”
Pork and Beans
into your home, we advise an early try.
The Beans come out of the tin crisp, whole and mellow, with a
beautiful Tomato Sauce cooked in. You can serve them hot by
simply placing the can in boiling hot water for several

1 DON’T know quite what has occurred,
Or how the thing was fixed ;
For over all that happened I
Am most intensely mixed ;
But just one fact I’m settled on.
We bade good-bye to- Robinson.
We met him, sometime, yesterday
(I don’t know who were “we
Brown, Smithers, Jones or otapleton
But part of it was me) ;
And Robinson, with martial eye,
Said : “Just one drink and then— good-bye !
We had that drink—we always do;
And e’er another came
We learnt that Robinson’s hot zeal
To guard old England’s fame
Was taking him to lands afar—
That he was going to the war.
Impatient of all need to wait
Was Robinson; and so,
To volunteer in London town
To-morrow he would go.
I don’t think it was right to say, „
As someone promptly did, “Hooray !”
Still, Robinson seemed very pleased ;
He shouted like a toff,
Then named to-morrow’s boat, and said
That we must see him off.
While minutes fled on clockwork wings,
We drank his health, and other things.
Still Robinson the limelight held.
He drew (to our delight)
The dangers he would have to face
When he went forth to fight.
He knetv, he said, he would be slain !
Whereat, of course, we cheered again.
“But for the Flag,” cried Robinson,
“From nothing shall I shrink!”
And Jones—or someone—cried “Hurrah !
Let’s have another drink !”
Which Robinson agreed to do:
“ ’Twill be the last I’ll have with you.”
Thus, like a hero, Robinson
Burbled to us all night;
And afterwards, beside the sea,
Until day’s dawning light
We, heedless of Post Office chimes,
Farewelled him half a hundred times.
When all the bottled beer was slain,
To town we came once more,
To toast again in further beer
Our hero of the war;
And then, when time was riper, we
Took Robinson unto the Quay.
We could not pick out Robinson;
Yet, as she moved away.
We loudly cheered the craft that bore
Our hero to the fray.
We shouted till the ship had gone—
Some others, I and Robinson!
I don’t know quite what has occurred—-
My facts seem muddled. I
Can’t see how Robinson got there
To bid himself good-bye.
N.s.w.

The Business Aspect.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THE young man with the wild look in
his eyes and with the rather long,
rough hair sits forward on his chair.
The other man with the black moustache
lolls deep back in the most comfortable
saddlebag. He bears the stamp of
prosperity, but the young man looks as if
he has everything before him. That is why
he has no time for the back of a chair. He
is eager. The other man is lazily good-
humored, as one will be who has just had a
good dinner and now smokes an aromatic
cigar. His hands are clasped across his
belt as if to say, “What I have eaten I shall
hold.”
“Yes,” says the young man, “success only
comes by hard work.”
“Sure.”
The older man’s voice seems to arise
somewhere at the back of his nose, but it
issues from the left side of his mouth, on
account of the right side being engaged
holding his cigar.
“It is hard to see how success seems to
chase some people up,” says the young man.
“People who are very often so little
deserving get it, and those who have burnt
the midnight oil wait on the mat of the
muse unrecognised.”
“Guess it’s jest luck,” says the successful
man. “Luck and havin’ the right goods.”
He spoke from the right side of his mouth
this time, having given his cigar an expert
twist to give it a chance.
“I’ve sure bin through it all,” he
continues. “Guess I’ve helped to wear out
mats some.”
“I’m young yet, of course,” says the
youth. “Though luck does not seem to
favor me, don’t you think that the capacity
for hard work will tell in the end?”
“Sure.” This from the left side of his
mouth again.
“I have had a hard struggle,” continues
the wild-eyed young man, “and have lain
awake night after night ready to grasp the
idea, but now I think it has come. All I
want is a flow of words.”
“Sure,” comes through the cigar smoke.
He seems to get a better cinch on his dinner
with his clasped hands, and nestles more
cosily fn his repose.
“It’s real good stuff, I know. One usually
does know when you get the right stuff.”
“Sure,” says the successful one.
“I don’t mind giving you some idea how
the thing goes, just roughly, you know.
Imagine a great, white bird floating
gracefully over Australia. Everybody sees
it, the city man hurrying on with his
business in the city streets, the farmer on
the rich coast belt, the squatter with his
myriad flocks in the interior, and the drover
on the long, dry stages of the inland deserts.
And all w T ho see it see only an allegory, the
promise of a glorious future. You
understand ?”
“Sure” —from the middle of his mouth,
having taken his cigar out to spit.
“The great white bird stands for the
greatness of the men and the goodness of
the women of this fair continent. It stands
for high ideals, for a white Australia; a
pure stock. It stands for rich soil, for fat
stock, for inexhaustible mineral supplies.
You follow me?”
“Sure” —this time from the left side of
his mouth again.
“The land grows fatter and richer, but
the great white bird loses his purity of
plumage, and as the years go on it grows
darker and darker, and spreads its black
wings farther and farther over the country,
and by-and-bye what was once a bird
becomes only a mighty storm cloud in the
shape of a bird. The people are changed.
The men are no longer great, the women no
longer good. The very wealth of the land
has ruined them. They have become idle
and live dirty lives, and the moral health
of them all has changed the spotless bird
into what we see. You quite understand?”
“Sure,” says the man whose voice comes
from the back of his nose.
“I Avant to save them,” cries the poet.
“I want to save our people from a
complacent acceptance of bounty. Did you
ever read Tom Hood’s ‘Song of the Shirt’?”
“No, sir, I guess I hev not”-—with a
twirl of his tongue to give each side of his
mouth an equal chance.
“It roused England, sir, and if I can only
get the inspiration I’ll put my stuff into
words that will make our people have
nightmares. It will come. It will come!”
he cries, his arms darting forward as if he
would pull his composition out of space.
“Sure,” says the American, lazily. “I
hope you will not think me inquisitive, but
•—what does it all lead to?”
The genius stares at the American in
astonishment.
“What?” he says.
“Wal, I guess I’ve bin following yew
pretty attentively, but I’ve bin wondering
all the time yew hev bin talking what goods
yew handle. I guess yew hev me kinder
mixed. When you spoke of farmers I sure
thought yew handled a new plough; and
then I thought yew handled some new kind
of shearing machine. But when yew spoke
of dirty lives, I sure guess it must be soap ;
then yew spoke of health, and I thought it
might be medicine ; but when yew got down
to shirts, I sure thought it’s mercery. But
I guess I don’t want to be at all inquisitive.”
He speaks as if it didn’t matter anyway,
and snuggles back in his chair again to
enjoy his smoke.
“It’s an epic!” cries the poet.
“A what?”
“An epic—a poem. It has nothing to do
Avith ploughs, or soap, or anything.”
The young man is blood-red in the face
and his eyes glitter angrily.
“Then I take it it’s no advertisement after
all?”
“No, sir. It’s a work of genius.”
The American throws away the end of
his cigar, calmly lights another, leans back
and takes a few puffs as if to make sure
it is all right and drawing properly.
“Wal, sir,” he then says. “All I kin say
is, that if it isn’t an advertisement, and
don’t boost ploughs, or soap, or something
that spells boodle ours hev bin an idle con-
versation. So let’s quit the subject.”
For a moment the youth glares at the
successful man, but the imperturbability of
that self-satisfied individual crushes him,
and he rises and lurches from the room.
The American seems scarcely conscious
that he has gone. He leans forward and
takes a paper and starts to read the market
report through a fog of smoke.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
OUR terrace hath what is called a “flat
roof,” as opposed to a hipped or
ridged one, though it slopes to the
rearand the iron is rusty and lets the rain
through on to the plaster in places. But it
was well built of good Australian hardwood
to withstand the high gales on the hills of
North Sydney. You can’t drive a nail into
any of the studs, they are so hard and old.
The terrace is very “convenient to tram
and ferry,” and that’s why the tenants hang
on to it like Grim Death. But, alas ! it is
also woefully convenient to the landlady, her
married son and daughter, and her lawful
agents. Our landlady’s castle overlooketh us
from the summit or peak behind, where she
sitteth on her tower on a sunny day, to
watch, like a hawk (the which bird she very
greatly resembleth) over her numerous, de-
caying possessions. The tenants are never
more than a very few weeks behind with
their rent. They can’t be. The days of
grace depend on their possessions.
About the only vice that afflicts the people
of our terrace is fowls and wire-netting.
It’s wonderful how the fowl disease, and, as
a consequence, the wire-netting habit, catches
on. The wives catch it first, and then their
husbands; and then you’ll see —and hear—
the men pottering round, Saturday after-
noons and Sunday mornings, with battens,
slats and wire-netting. At least, in truth,
it might be said that it’s the men that get
the wire-netting fever; and they get it worse
than the women get the hen sickness. And
the results are nil—except aggravation,
worry and waste of time and shillings. A
man might just as well be at the pub.
Better! For I’ve known happy homes to be
broken up by hens and wire-netting.
I’ve had a life-lonar hatred for hens. No
need to explain the reasons to most peace-
loving men. A hen —well, a hen is a hen.
My immediate landlady, contrariwise, has
loved hens since her girlhood. She’ll set a
hen—or, in fact, anything in feathers —and
when the resultant clutch has gone, to the
last miserable chick, to the cats and the
rats and the warts (or chilblains) and the
cold, she’ll start saving all the new-laid
eggs from the breakfast-table and hiding
them away to set again.
On the other hand, I have a weakness for
Muscovy ducks. Muscovies are gentle, sen-
sible and considerate —like most foreigners

KICKED BY A HORSE
Flash Laid Open—-Painful, Inflamed Wound
Perfectly Healed by ZAM-BUK.
THE power of Zam-Buk is nowhere more highly
appreciated than among the busy toilers on
farms, sheep and cattle stations and outback
selections, where the workers —a hundred or two
hundred miles from medical assistance —need
this unique and reliable Balm to cleanse and
“sweeten” their wounds, and prevent “gather-
ing,” festering, inflammation, poisoning and
It may be at the plough; in the workshop;
while splitting, fencing, branding, mustering or
shearing; or in the homestead itself —the hands
receive nasty cuts and burns, and the body and
legs painful bruises and abrasions, which require
the immediate soothing, healing, antiseptic
powers of Zam-Buk to prevent festering or
poisoning, and ensure prompt and perfect heal-
ing. <Zain-Buk thus enables the worker to con-
tinue his work without inconvenience, or loss of
time and money.
Illustrating Zam-Buk’s pain-killing, purify*
ing properties is the case of Mr, John Bent,
of 31 Sydney Street, Collingwood, Melbourne,
who says:—“Two years ago I was kicked by a
horse on the left side of my face, the hobf
catching me near the cheek bone, Ikying th§
flesh open ahd leaving a gash an inch deep.
Matter flowed from the wound, which became
very much inflamed. The side of my face
swelled to an enormous extent and the pain
was excruciating.
/•
Mr. BENT, whose
gashed cheek was
healed by Zam-Buk.
“Being fully aware of the sterling healing qualities of Zam-Buk, I
obtained a supply and dressed the injury with it. The effect was
marvellous, for the pain was very much subdued and the smarting and
inflammation eased. I continued the dressings with Zam-Buk, which finally
drew out all inflammation, reduced the swelling, and in ft few days 1 time
completely healed the wound. Zam-Buk grew beautiful, new healthy skin
over the place where the gash had been.
“We always keep a supply of Zam-Buk ili Gut’ hoinfe, for it iS & Splendid
balm to have handy where there are children, who are constantly nurtiiig
and cutting themselves.”

A FEW NOtyELY
. . HINTS ON . .
BEAUTY.
By RITA MOYA.
Every woman should take pride in her personal appearance. If it is not possible to
be beautiful in the fullest sense of the word, at least you can have the attractiveness of ft
pleasant expression, glossy, well-kept hair, eyes shaded by long lashes, well mftrkea efej
brows and a clear, natural complexion. My first advice is to avoid most manufactured
“beauty preparations.” Use simple, pure, natural ingredients. Use these regularly, and do
not make constant changes and experiments. The various things I use and advise can be
bought in original packages from any reliable chemist. If they are not in stock he can at
once procure them from his wholesaler if you insist.
How I Discarded an Unsightly Complexion.
—How many women exclaim as they behold
their ugly complexions in the mirror: “If I
could only tear off this old skin!” and, do you
know, it is now possible to do that very thing?
Not to actually remove the entire skin all of a
sudden; that would be too heroic a method
and painful, too, I imagine. The worn-out
cuticle comes off in such tiny particles, and
so gradually—requiring about 10 days to com-
plete the transformation—it doesn’t hurt a bit,
Day by day the beautiful complexion under-
neath comes forth. Marvellous! No matter
how muddy, rough, blotchy or aged your com-
plexion, you can surely discard it by this
simple process. Just get some ordinary mer-
colised wax at your chemist’s, apply nightly
like cold cream, washing it off in the morn-
ings.
New Painless Way to Remove Hairy
Growths. —lt now transpires that the mys-
terious white paste used so successfully by
many beauty specialists for ridding the skin
of objectionable hairy growths is nothing
more than powdered pheminol, which can be
found in any chemist’s shop. With pheminol
and water make enough paste to cover hairy
surface; apply, and in two or three minutes
rub off, wash the skin, and it will be free
from hair or blemish.
Shampoo and Hair Beautifler. — You complain
of brittle, faded hair. You will find that keep-
ing the scalp clean and healthy is the most
effective way to restore the natural beauty
and softness, but in selecting your shampoo
avoid soaps or mixtures containing “free”
alkali. By dissolving a teaspoonful of stallax
in a cup of hot water you will have a mild,
soothing, cleansing mixture that makes the
head feel fine and removes all dust, dandruff
and excess of oil, leaving the scalp clean and
pliant, and assuring a beautiful growth of
long, lustrous, fluffy hair.
No Powder Necessary.-—-Yes, powder _ has
ruined more complexions that it has aided,
and while you use it you can hope for nothing
better than an imitation of a real complexion.
Take my advice. Get from your chemist some
ordinary cleminite and dissolve in a little
water, then you will have an ideal yet inex-
pensive lotion, which seems a part of the skin,
The result lasts all day long even under the
most trying conditions. To prepare the face
and neck for an evening in a hot ballroom
there is nothing to equal this simple and harm-
less lotion.
If Eyelashes are Short. —Eyelashes will be
greatly beautified if mennaline be applied at
lash-roots with thumb and forefinger. A
few such treatments make them grow long,
silky and curly. Thin, straggly eyebrows will
grow thick and lustrous by merely rubbing
mennaline on, but be careful and don’t get
any where no hair is wanted.
Wonderful Growth of Hair. —Long ago I
made a resolution to try and concoct a real
hair grower. My own formula, now perfected
after tedious experimenting, has had the effect
of giving me a wealth of hair that is surpris-
ing. Obtain from your chemist an original
package of boranium and mix with this i-pint
of bay rum. Rub this into the scalp night
and morning with the finger tips. It sets the
hair roots tingling with new life. [6

in a foreign land—and I think I can fairly
include mine amongst the People of Our
Terrace. When Muscovies do get into your
little bit of a garden they only get there on
their way to the kitchen door, or on a
short exploring trip into new country, to
have a look round and, incidentally, keep an
eye out for likely earth nests. And they’ll
waddle back obediently, one after the other,
through the hole they came in through. Not
as a hen does. She cackles and screeches,
and runs and flaps frantically in every
way but that of the wide open garden gate;
and dashes herself against solid walls, and
knocks down the rest of the flower-pots, and
generally completes the ruin that her
scratching has begun. You know how a
hen —especially one with chickens —can up-
root a garden, and undermine and bring
down a rockery in no space of time? And
see what a fuss she makes if you’re fixing
up round her nest when she’s setting, in
rainy weather while the water is getting at
it; or in hot, scorching weather, when the
sun is around ! The silly, alleged nest she
often chooses for herself, when you’ve made
her half a dozen good ones to pick from!
One of my landlady’s hens would lay no-
where but in an old, disused washhouse cop-
per ; and she’d go through blazes to get
there. Now, howinell did she think she
was going to get her chickens out of that
wash-boiler when they hatched? Another
started in a box nailed half-way up a wall
to hold ferns.
No. When Mrs. Muscovy makes her own
nest, which she prefers to do, it’s generally
a good one and in the best situation avail-
able. And you can fix up round her, and
even move her when she’s sitting, without
her making a fuss about it —except to give
you an admonitory dab when she thinks
you’re bothering round too much—like as if
you were a troublesome child. And when
she comes off her nest she doesn’t fool
round, like a hen does, if you don’t happen
t« be there to feed her. No. She comes
down to the house and flans her wings and
gibbers loudly, to let you know she’s off and
wants tucker. I’ve known her to half-flap,
half-climb her way right over a tall back
garden gate on such an occasion.
It used to amuse me, in another house,
to watch Mrs. Muscovy going back to her
nest, by a side passage, after being attended
to by my landlady. I feel quite sure that
Mrs. M. (the. duck, and not the landlady)
was quite aware of me quizzing her over the
side fence, but her mind was haunted by
other and greater and, to me—and possibly
to her —vague dangers to her eggs ; and she
moved with the instinct of some ancestress
of a hundred years ago, or so, on Russian
marshes. Her nest was close at hand, under
some bushes and old timber against the
dividing fence; but, to all appearances, she
was making up to a little vegetable garden
I had made at the top of the narrow “pad-
dock.” She would be getting along, ludi-
crously like some _ old Sairey Gamp, bound
to an urgent case in her profession—say, one
of Mrs. Harris’s —somewhere just beyond
the near horizon. In this case it was always
Mrs. Harris’s; for, just exactly opposite her
nest, Mrs. Muscovy would shift her helm,
with marvellous dexterity for a duck, at
right angles to her alleged course, and,
with a flip of first one foot and then the
other—-to kick off the dirt —and a flicker of
her tail, she’d be on to her eggs. Of course
you know her family goes for a swim the
day after they come into the world. At first
I call them “the Dils” ; after that “the Wrig-
glers” ; and later on “the Waddlers.” Then
comes that absurd stage when they are like
sagged barges, always pitching, fore and
aft, and seem to have been intended by
nature to be quadrupeds. This, and onwards,
is a great stuffing period, until, at last,
nearly all of them who are drakes, and
most of them who are ducks, become stuffed
duck—and roasted. I appreciate them at
that period also.
Then, again. Muscovy ducks, unlike the
common hen family, are sociable amongst
themselves. Did you ever see a Muscovy
duck convention, or mothers’ meeting (or
Liberal Labor League) ? Especially when
some new members have been introduced
to the duck yard ! They talk with their
necks, but not through them, as most other
people do. They do it by jerking the said
necks regularly backwards and forwards,
slowly, or more rapidly, according to their
feelings-—mutual indignation or approba-
tion—or the heat of the argument.
Common fowls have no chance against
Muscovies. We had a rooster; he’s sold to
a neighbor now, who calls him Henry. I
used to call the rooster Grant. He’d make
a fuss if a bantam laid an egg. Well, I
never saw such a flabbergasted rooster as
Grant, the first time he tackled a Muscovy
drake, and met a hurricane on one end
coming at him. Muscovies stand up and spread
their wings and fight with them, carrying
all other fowls before them like dust. And
the ram-beak is still in reserve.
There was a brown hen we called
Browny. I had a soft spot in my heart
for her, though she was a bigger fool in
one way than all the other hens put to-
gether. She would sit on an egg anywhere
she found it. Her favorite place would be
on a dish of eggs on a corner of the kitchen
dresser. But she wouldn’t go insane and
shriek round and hurt herself and smash
half the crockery. She’d allow herself to
be lifted down and carried firmly out and
dropped over the fowlyard fence. But she’d
be back again about the third time there-
after that you meandered into the kitchen
in search of matches. Now. one day, before
Browny became hopelessly insane, and dur-
ing a period while she was laying, with
another hen, in a sensible nest in the fowl-
yard, one of the newly bought Muscovies
came and laid an egg in Browny’s nest in
the night. She must have been a sur-
prised, not to say a startled, hen when she
went in to lay that morning. Anyway she
got out again in a hurry, and said a lot
about it. She’d never seen even an ordi-
nary duck’s egg before, and this was as big
as two. She seemed to blame it on to the
other hen that was sharing the nest with
her. She said it was po-si-tiv-ly indecent!
But I could see that she was awfully jealous
all the same. Perhaps it was this upset
that led to Browny’s subsequent insanitv.
It’s a very easy transition from Muscovy
to Turkey, but I haven’t had sufficient ex-
perience with “Claras” —by which name all
Turkey hens are known to me —to speak with
confidence about their habits. However, I
believe that Clara is of a lovable disposition.
!She’s very light for her size, and feathery
and springy on her legs, and slie doesn t
make a fuss when you pick her up; and I
understand she’ll sit anywhere, and at any
time, and on any kind of egg—-from a ban-
tam’s to an alligator’s—according to re-
quirements.
I was acquainted with one gander—l call
them “Barneys.” And Barney was a Goose
—with a capital G. Barney’s solitary goose
was sitting when we first shifted to his
place—which we rented, along with him,
irom his former landlady—and his days
seemed wholly occupied in making futile
charges at anything that appeared on his
horizon; ourselves included. (The solitary
result of these charges was the occasional
squawk of one of the passing school chil-
dren, whose bare legs seemed to be magnified
to elephants’ legs to Barney.) At the
sight of the enemy Barney would get ready.
He’d arch his neck to breaking point, with
head and beak horizontal. Then he’d stretch
his neck out, straight and stiff and almost
on a level with the ground, give his war
hiss and charge. But within a couple of
feet of his enemy, if said enemy showed no
sign of fleeing, Barney would sheer off and
pretend he’d made a mistake, or that the
enemy was harmless and beneath his con-
tempt. Otherwise, say in the case of little
school girls, Barney would follow up with
a series of false alarms. The shutting and
opening of an umbrella always demoralised
him and put him to rout with great
slaughter. You try it with fowls and chick-
ens in the garden. They reckon it’s
the last word in hawks. You hang that
umbrella open on the fence and they won’t
come back for quite a while.
The second day I brought my dog Fri-
day to our new place, or rather to
Barney’s old place. Friday is a smooth-haired
white mongrel of parts, with a tail im-
modestly short and a black eye. At the
sight of him Barney formed for battle. It
was a glorious episode. Friday just deigned
a glance at the approaching torpedo and
yawned. I never saw such a disgruntled
bird m my life as that gander was then—
and for the rest of the day.
And this brings me to dog Friday—but
not just yet.
The parrot, Joseph, was dealt with in a
previous sketch, as leaving home periodically
in violent convulsions of temper, and being
brought back as often in a towering rage
and a school-boy’s cap. Cocky has been
away from home about two years now (a
hundred years, more, or less, makes little
difference to his species), so I may expect
him home any day. And I won’t be glad
to see him. He will immediately proceed to
scare fits out of the new cat; and then to
ringbark any plants that have grown up in
the yard since he was home last.
Dooly, the old cat, who was also immortal-
ised some years ago (in an ode) in these
pages, died before the fire in my study the
other night. He was stiff and cold long
before he ceased to breath and to swear
affectionately in a rasping purr—which was
characteristic of Dooly. He was x - aised in a
hay-and-corn store, where they starved him
over Sundays and holidays, so’s he’d kill
mice—until rescued by a lady friend of
mine. He had thrived on wheat, corn, pol-
lard, etc., and his teeth wei’e like chisels
and his claws like schnapper hooks with tear-
ing at wheat bags. His last years were
peace, he having early discouraged all the
other tom-asses (sometimes two at a time)
in the neighborhood. He was fond of corn
and pollard to the last, and would burgle the
fowls’ supply.. He was buried with honors,
in the earth, in the middle of the rockery,
with a sizeable rock over him to prevent the
hens from scratching up his brave old war-
rior bones.
There remains dog Friday. He came as a
lost dog to the front steps one day (at regis-
tration time, by the way), and after being
fed and watered there for a day or two,
surreptitiously, by my landlady, was let in
on probation. And that was the end of it.
I’d like to know what Friday’s previous
master was. Perhaps an English village
poacher, who smuggled his dog out in an
immigrant ship, and, finding no poaching in
Sydney to speak of, came down in the world.
and had to desert his dawg. Friday learned
—with my assistance —to leave the land-
lady’s hens alone. He used to catch them
and bring them to me in his mouth, alive,
evidently paralysed into silence by terror.
It interfered with their laying capacity. But
Friday could never get over his unaccount-
able hatred for anything in uniform; and it
gets his present master into bothers and
causes him anxiety. Said hatred is not
limited to policemen either; there is always
trouble when a new postman comes—or when
the old one is relieved at holiday time. Fri-
day also intensely dislikes anything in
clerical garb, especially that of the Anglican
or Roman denomination. This is awkward
for me in the public streets. The other
sunny day. when I thought Friday was safe
asleep in the back yard, and the front door
shut, there came a knock, and Friday
slipped through. The door was ajar, and
there was a big. fresh, healthy, new police-
man. At least he was fresh to Friday. He
only wanted to find out if we were on the
rolls. Young constable Muller had a three-
cornered rent in his uniform pants, but I
think we’ll be able to fix the matter up. for
Muller’s elder brother and I were school-
mates in the bush long asm.
It goes without saying that the children
are fond of Friday, and can do anything
with him ; but I’m afraid I’ll have to get rid
of him before _ he runs down a mounted
trooper and frightens his horse and breaks
his (the trooper’s) neck.

And now I find I’ve said nothing about
the people of our terrace at all, unless the
poultry and the animals be people. But
never mind —I’ve described them more or less
in other places. There’s one character who
is fairly common. That’s the old grand-dad
of the terrace. He knew my landlady’s
people, and it gives him great pleasure. “Ha-
Ha ! I knowed Joe” (her father! “and I
knowed Will!”
Then, at the other end of life, there's
my little friend, Primrose Chambers. “I’m
goin’ to school next week!” she shrilled into
my ear yesterday, “to learn to wead and
wite —and after that I’m r/oino to be caned!”
