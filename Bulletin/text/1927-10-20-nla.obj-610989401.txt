The Red Page
Stevenson and Henley
As a youthful editor at Cassell’s, it
chanced that I took a small part in a matter
which afterwards became a literary event
of great importance and world-wide interest.
This was the publication of Robert Louis
Stevenson’s great romance of adventure,
“Treasure Island.” To the big printing and
publishing establishment in Belle Sauvage
Yard came most of the ambitious young
writers of the time, among them Stevenson
and Rider Haggard. Stevenson I have
already described; Rider Haggard was his
very opposite in personal appearance—tall,
square-shouldered, loose-jointed, slim, with
short, red hair and moustache, without the
least pose and personal vanity, a briefless
barrister lately returned from South Africa.
Stevenson came into Cassell’s in a quiet
Way; in fact, not in person, but by means
of a manuscript, if such it might, be called,
received by post, though he might easily
have asked Iris friend W. E. Henley to act
as liis sponsor, for Henley was' at Cassell’s
as editor of the Macazink or Art. But I
know that Henley was not particularly in-
terested in this manuscript,. Stevenson had
published in one of Alexander Henderson’s
penny boys’ papers a tale of adventure en-
titled “The Sea Cook,” and had pasted the
badlv-printed chapters, as they appeared
serially, into a foolscap exercise-book on
both sides of the pages, and had drawn very
roughly on the inside of the cover a crude
map of an imaginary island, under which
he had printed in capital letters “Treasure
Island.” This apparently had lain neglected
for some time on the desk of the chief of the
editorial department, Mr. John Williams,
a mere business man of no literary ability
or imagination, and there it, might have re-
mained neglected still further—for it was
a very unalluring affair—but for my chance
call on him one day. My youth, no doubt,
suggested to him that he had a “reader”
ready at hand. When I had got the instruc-
tions I asked for and was leaving, he picked
up the exercise-book and handed it to me,
saying, “Take this and let me know what
you think of it. It’s a boys’ story. Let
me know to-morrow if it is any good.” ■
I took it home, not expecting anything
more of it than of the numerous other
manuscripts I had read for the firm—l sup-
pose I was given the obvious “duds”—but
dutifully sat down after my evening meal
to look at it at least. From the first it
gripped me. I had, of course, read all the
popular boys’ fiction years before —Mayne
Reid. Marryat, Jules Verne and the rest —
but my choice memories of all of them were
effaced. Here was something quite differ-
ent. There was a literary touch about it
(hat fascinated me. “The Sea Cook” was,
1 soon found, very much more than a mere
boys’ story. The welt-contrived “atmo-
sphere” of the thing, its amazing lifclikc-
ness, its picturesqueness, the vividness of
its characters, that awful blind Pew especi-
ally, had a quality about them quite differ-
ent from anything I had read before. It
had a strange spell which compelled me to
persist in reading the smudged small type,
the rough paper often created in pasting it
. down, sometimes consequently almost unde-
cipherable. I held on right through until
it was finished, though my eyes ached and
I had to light my bedroom candle when the
gas was turned off at the main by my
thrifty landlady. I even re-read the first
part before putting it down reluctantly and
going weary to bed.
Next morning I was on the watch for
Mr. Williams’s usually late arrival. I fol-
lowed him into liis room, taking no notice
of his exclamation of disapproval, and
poured out a volley of enthusiastic com-
ment. so that he stared at me surprised
and then smiled tolerantly as he turned
his attention to his correspondence.
When Henley came in later—l don’t
think it was the same day, for he was not
regular in his attendance at his office—l
attacked him with the same excited pane-
gyric, and he too smiled tolerantly at my
ardor. “See me in it?” he asked, and I said
“No,” very readily. “He put me in as the
pirate,” Henley chuckled.. “Like his
damned impudence.” Then after a pause:
"Well. I’ll tell Louis what you say. Think
they’ll publish it?” “Of course,” I replied
confidently, and he smiled again and turned
to his own work. I was disappointed,,for I
had expected Henley to be more responsive.
He evidently did not think much of “The
Sea Cook,” perhaps had not then read it, or
if he, had and did, was not saying so to me;
but that was not unusual with him, though
he could be interested enough in subjects
he started himself.
Stevenson was a very prolific writer in
those days, seeking strenuously to make a
living as a writer and in need of cash.
Among other work, he had been writing
plays with Henley, and one of these,
“Deacon Brodie, or the Double Life,” was
to be tried out, at a matinee performance
about this time. Henley had great hopes
of it and often spoke of what he considered
its strong dramatic situations. Stevenson
was not allowed to take any part in the
preparations, on account of his health, and
was not iii London for more than a day or
two at a time ; he did not, even see the play
performed. I witnessed the performance
at Henley’s invitation, and have seldom, if
ever, sat. out a more dismal function. It
was produced one gloomy Thursday after-
noon at the dingy little Prince of Wales’s.
Theatre, which the Bancrofts managed to
make ring with laughter and shake with
applause, but “Deacon Brodie” awakened
no merriment and won no enthusiasm, and
the critics “slated” it in the morning. But
we all called out loudly for the “Author!”
at the end, and Henley stumped on before
the curtain on his crutches and bowed awk-
wardly and solemnly. He afterwards con-
fessed that it was a poor thing. It was not
seen in London again, but was produced in
Edinburgh and some other provincial cities.
It was Beerbohm Tree who made the one
success with a Henley-Stevenson play, his
production of “Beau Austin” many years
later being decidedly good; but from the
literary point of view the real Stevenson
play was “Admiral Guinea.”

Children’s Reading
The many appeals made to teachers by
educated parents for advice concerning suit-
able books to procure for children is an
indication that it is recognised to be a
parental responsibility to direct the child’s
interests into paths of good literature. The
advice is not always easy to give, because
so many factors—age, sex, ability, interests
—have to be regarded. Books that the
normal child will read with avidity are not
difficult to name; but getting the child to
read at the right time the book that will
do more than provide ephemeral pleasure
demands thoughtful study both of books
obtainable and of the boj or girl to be
considered.
All parents will find it helpful to consult
some of the reading lists that have been
prepared by students of children’s reading
interests. For a long time, Sayer’s “Child-
ren’s Libraries” was extensively- consulted,
but it is now difficult to procure except
from some old-established libraries. Some
time ago there was discussed in The Bul-
letin (R.P. 30/9/’26) “The Winnetka
Graded List,” which is invaluable in choos-
ing fiction of literary merit suited to child-
ren of varied ages. More recently Professor
Jordan has revised his “Children’s Reading”
(University of North Carolina Press), which
was originally published in 1921. The work
is the result of extensive investigations of
books popular with children between the
ages of 9 and 18 years. Lists of both
fiction and of magazines are included in
the book.
The predominant consideration in the
compilation of the lists mentioned has been
the interest of the child. No reading lists
which neglect this are of much value, but
something more is required. The interested
parent and teacher desire to encourage the
reading, not oijJ.y of fiction, but also of
books of travel, biography, science, poetry,
etc. The most instructive book for such a
purpose is the recently published “Child-
ren’s Reading” (Appleton and Co.), written
by Dr. L. Terman, whose researches on
children’s ability arc classic, and Margaret
Lima. My indebtedness to this book is
gycat. The authors’ comments will aid
greatly any person trying to choose books
lor boys and girls appropriate to their
mental development and interests.
Good reading habits in adult life are in-
fluenced largely by the gratification of
natural interests at each period of the child’s
development. The child who has mastered
the mechanics of reading at eight years of
age has a considerable advantage over the
child who does not attain mastery until he
is nine years old. Up to the age of seven
years, the average child’s interests are in
picture-books of the “Mother Goose”
variety. He is a willing listener to fairy
tales, particularly when the storyteller per-
mits him to peruse illustrative prints.
Although he does not care to read Steven-
son’s “Child’s Garden of Verses” until he
is about 10 years of age, the bright child
will profitably enjoy having the poems read
to him at as early an age as six years. Dur-
ing the eighth and ninth years the fchild
lives in the land of fairy talcs far removed-
from the real world. Nothing seems im-
possible to him. In most cases the maxi-
mum interest in fairy tales is at the age of
eight years. Grimm’s and Andersen’s col-
lections as well as Barrie’s “Peter Pan” and
Carroll’s “Alice in Wonderland” are favor-
ites at this time. So, too, are Morcomb’a
“Red Feather” and Bannerman’s “Little
Black Sambo.” The girl lingers longer in
the land of fairy tales than the boy, who
generally becomes interested in the affairs
of real life when he is approaching 10 years
of age. Although the interests of boys and
girls diverge somewhat from this point, it
is not unusual for girls to be interested in
boys’ books.
The reading habit should be well fixed
by the time the child is 10 years old. From
then on, innumerable begin to make
an appeal. The boys revel in Ellis, Ballan-
tyne, Henty, etc.; and the girls in Ruskin’s
“King of the Golden River,” Barrie’s "Peter
Pan and Wendy,” Frances Browne’s
“Granny’s_ Wonderful Chair,” Louisa Alcott’s
“Little Women,” Johanna Spyri’s “Heidi,”
and Australian books of which Ethel
Turner’s are typical. Boys, too, enjoy the
last-named.
During the twelfth and thirteenth years
most boys who have not read them earlier,

Sunnybrook Farm,” Alcott’s “Jo’s Boys,
Dickens’s “Oliver Twist,” Blackmores
“Lorna Doone,” and Eliot’s “Silas Marner,”
as well as many of the boys’ favorites.
Most teachers agree with the statement
of Terman and Lima that at about the age
of 12, one girl in 10 and one boy in 20 read
poetry voluntarily. There is by no means
general agreement, however, as to whether
the loss of interest is due to normal develop-
mental changes or to failure to provide suit-
able lyrics and ballads when the child’s
early interest in jingles and verses begins to
wane. Certainly, reading the poems aloud
to children is more likely to induce interest
than prematurely putting the book in their
hands. There are still families where father
or mother will delight in reading to their
offspring, in addition to the verse already
named, Palgrave’s “Children’s Treasury of
Lyrical Poetry,” Blake’s “Songs of Inno-
cence,” Eugene Field’s “Poems of Child-
hood,” the books of verse and ballads pub-
lished by the Oxford University, and some
of the anthologies of Australian verse. At
13, some girls, and fewer boys, enjoy Long-
fellow’s “Evangeline.” Lamb’s “Tales from
Shakspeare” will be read by most girls and
boys at the age of 12-£ years. A few months
later the girls will probably enjoy “A Mid-
summer Night’s Dream,” and a year later a
small percentage of boys and girls will de-
light in “A Merchant of Venice.” It is
not difficult, however, for the keen lover
of Shakspeare to interest whole classes of
boys and girls in both these plays. Much
of Tennyson’s work, such as “Idylls of the
King,” is enjoyed by the early adolescent
girls.
Through the early interest of children in
animal stories a love of nature books may
be fostered. Although the old favorite, A.
Sewell’s “Black Beauty,” is not universally
judged to be of literary merit, it is ex-
tremely popular with boys and girls of 11
years of age. At the same age, Seton’s
“Biography of a Grizzly” and, afterwards,
his “Wild Animals I Have Known” delight
most children. Every child should be
afforded the opportunity of reading Jean
Fabre’s books, “Our Humble Helpers,”
“Book of Insects” and “The Wonder Book
of Chemistry.” With a few children no
story other than that involved in the un-
folding of the facts is necessary to interest
them in natural science. It is not unusual
to find in bush schools boys of 12 years who
cherish Leach’s “Australian Bird Book.'
Many a teacher with a school among the
forests of the N.S.W. North Coast would
welcome a similar book dealing with native
shrubs and trees.
Most bovs at 10 years of age or later
show some interest in machinery, mechanics,
etc. In the case of one out of five, the
glimmer may be fanned into a flame. Gen-
erally the interest is in a special phase, e.g.,
wireless. Suitable books abound. Some
useful ones are those written by A. R. Bond,
the associate editor of the Scientific
American.
No library at home or at school is com-
plete unless it caters for the development
of a love of history. The genesis of interest
is in the old myths loved by the very
young. The Greek legends and myths are
told in many forms. Church’s little books
published by Macmillan, Guerber’s excel-
lent collections, and Nathaniel Hawthorne’s
versions of old myths are popular with
children between 11 and 14 years of age.
Scott, Lytton, Dickens, Masefield and
Conan Doyle are but a few of the host
contributing historical novels appealing
more or less to the adolescent. Australia
is still waiting for the writer able to capture
the interest of youth with epics of early
Australian history. Van Loon’s “History of
Mankind” is not widely known by Aus-
tralian children, but its readers are increas-
ing. I have seen a boy as young as 11
years reading and enjoying “The Times
History of the World,” but he was the
prodigy dear to the psychologist. It should
not be difficult, however, to interest the boy
of 14 years in H. G. Wells’s “Short History
of the World.”
OLIVER K.
A National Eisteddfod
The London Musical Times contained a
record of 33 musical festivals, or eis-
teddfods, held during the first fortnight in
May in the British Isles. Some of the
details are extraordinarily interesting. For
instance, at Birmingham there was a special
section for school choirs, the members to
be under the age of 11 years. There
were 42 entries in that competition. At
Lewes there were 46 choirs in the various
classes. At Glasgow the festival spread
over 14 days, and more than 100 choirs
competed in the school sections alone, 29 in
the women’s and 26 in the men’s. In many
sections there was a sight-reading test for all
choirs. Glasgow, it might be mentioned, is
approximately the >size of Sydney. One
school choir competing at Inverness came
from the Isle of Skye. Many of the mem-
bers of anotner choir had never previously
seen a train. The report of this festival, as
of most of the others, concludes with the
interesting remark that the hall in which
the festival was held was always crowded,
and that at times hundreds were turned
away. At Ballymena, in Ireland, 66 choirs
competed, including three factory choirs.
The competitors numbered over 2000.
It is a thing of wonder that Australians
are so unenthusiastic in choral matters;
and Sydney, which frequently boasts of its
golden voices, is probably worst off of all.
The Conservatorium, as is only right, has
a choir of some standing. Our other all-
too-few, with the possible exception of the
madrigal people, subsist on “Messiah”
potage, “Elijah” entree, roast beef d la
Gounod and dessert de Bizet “Carmen.”
Ecclesiastical choristers perform excerpts
from the tortured “Messiah” at Christmas,
after which they practise assiduously for
either Stainer’s “Crucifixion” or Maunder’s
“Olivet to Calvary” for Easter. They rest
on their oars or sing banal anthems till
November, when they once more practise
for the starting-point of their vicious circle.
Fortunately there are a couple of rebel
choirmasters who refuse to join them.
Caleb Simper is anathema to these stal-
warts, neither do they perform “Send Out
Thy Light.”
British experiences all seem to point to
the fact that music festivals do a lot to
breathe life into a musically sterile people.
What is obviously wanted, in Sydney
especially, is a national eisteddfod, an
eisteddfod that will draw all the leading
choirs of N. S. Wales and every other State
to its bosom; an eisteddfod that will
have a special section for chamber music;
an eisteddfod that will embrace the
original Welsh idea of being mainly and
fundamentally a competition for national
compositions, both literary and musical.
The thing should be a yearly function;
and, although we have many capable
critics and adjudicators, it would not be a
bad idea if we imported a world-renowned
adjudicator every now and again in order
that he might give us his view of our
musical standing in the world.
This idea of a national eisteddfod is no
idle dream. Manly, which is known far
and wide as a little city of Charltons and
Rugby footballers, has decided to turn its
attention to the more aesthetic side of life.
With that tod in view, it is already
organising another eisteddfod to be held
next year. Other suburbs will probably
follow its example. The enthusiasm of
the suburban cricketer makes the Test
match a possibility. Is it a reckless pro-
phecy that a few more suburban festivals
will prepare the city of Sydney for its
national eisteddfod?
KEITH BARRY.
Australian Literature Abroad
“Australians won’t read their own
authors,” a London publisher, speaking
with personal experience of the book-trade
in Australia, told me four months ago;
and one or two others followed with simi-
lar opinions. Island novels, t'oo, are out
of favor in London, some of them averred.
Had I chanced to interview only those
publishers and editors I might have re-
turned to Australia to join in the chorus
that no demand exists for Australian and
Island matter. But I saw many others in
London, and I had seen several in New
York; so I came home to tell quite a
different story.
“I do not agree that Australian and
Island books are out of favor,” said, in
effect, a leading publisher. “If the treat-
ment. is satisfactory these books will sell. I
would like an Australian book on certain
lines.” He went into details, and put the
job up to me. Another well-known pub-
lisher said that his house had published
Australian novels with fair success and will
welcome more. In London alone there are
half a dozen houses that will publish Aus-
tralian novels. And, saying no word about
prejudice against Island novels, a publisher
accepted one of the kind on sight and is
handling several more.
Concerning Australian literature in
America, the book editor of one of the
oldest publishing houses remarked: “Since
‘For the Term of His Natural Life’ we have
not seen any outstanding Australian story.
We would welcome a really good Australian
novel.” The principal of one of the largest
New York houses assured me that Aus-
tralian books are desired. The subject
matter is immaterial if the treatment is
right.
Publishers’ opinions and preferences obvi-
ously are dictated by individual experience,
or influenced by observation of rival firms’
experiences. In specific cases London pub-
lishers work on so surprisingly narrow a
margin of profit that publication of a book,
particularly if the author is unknown to the
British public, amounts to a risky gamble.
Success or failure of a 7s. 6d. or ss. first
edition depends on the approval of the
large libraries that take up to 250 copies
each. In publication of high-priced books
the buying public is a secondary factor.
We read occasional objections to intro-
duction of “remainders” into Australia. A
clause in one of the contracts I signed in
London confers upon me the option of pur-
chasing possible remainders. But cheap
remainders do not eventuate exclusively in
books written and printed abroad. In Syd-
ney I have seen stacks of a book written
and printed in Australia, published at 2s.
6d. and offered at 4d.; another, a novel,
published at ss. was on sale marked Is. 6d.,
which price subsequently advanced to 3s.
6d. Such cases will take some beating by
imported remainders.

£1700 Prize Story Competition
The Bulletin wants the Australian novel
to take the place of the American and Eng-
lish productions which now flood the book-
shops.
To this end it offers a minimum of £l7OO
in prizes for novels during the next three
years.
The first competition will close at The
Bulletin Office on June 30, 1928. For
this the prizes will be: First, £500; 2nd,
£125; 3rd, £75.
All persons Australian-born are eligible;,
also all persons bona fide resident in Aus-
tralia. (This includes Maoriland and the
South Pacific.)
The stories are to be available for serial
publication in The Bulletin and The
Woman’s Mirror. Otherwise, copyright will
belong wholly to the writer; all picture
rights will likewise remain his property.
Every story entered for the competition
is to be signed with a pen-name and be
accompanied by a sealed envelope contain-
ing both the pen-name and the real name
and address of the writer.
A Satchel of Books
Surplus Fat and How to Reduce It, by
W. F. Christie (Cornstalk Publishing Co.).
An informative treatise, so written that
even the fattest can read it without effort.
Our Sisters, by M. I. Howson (E. W.
Cole). A continuation of “Life’s Solemnity,”
by this author. The booklet is an earnest
plea on behalf of city missions, and contains
some of the writer’s poetical compositions.
This and That, by T. Jasper (Pallamaua
Press). Lucidity and charm of simple
expression mark this collection of brief
essays, many of which first saw light in
the Red Page of The Bulletin. The essays
cover a wide field, and each of the number
has the merit of exciting thought and at
the same time striking a human note.
The History of Reparations, by Carl
Bergmann (Bonn). As a representative of
the German Government with the Reparation
Commission and later on a confidential
adviser during the negotiations with the
Allied Governments, the Reparation Com-
mission and the Committee of Experts, the
author has a basis of experience upon which
to express the views contained in this
characteristically thorough, if ponderous,
work.
The House of Fulfilment, by L. Adams
Beck (Fisher Unwin). When this author
throws a mantle of romance over historical
personages and poets she is E. Barrington ;
when she tackles “a romance of the soul”
she becomes L. Adams Beck. Kashmir and
Little Thibet are the background of this
romance, and the super-normal happenings
woven into the story are allegedly drawn
from Oriental sources. Quite a well-filled
shop-window; but one doubts whether the
goods will wash.
Thurstantype, by E. Paget Thurstan
(Imperial Printing Co., W.A.). The author,
a medical man blind for many years past,
who has had to use Braille for the purpose
of reading, finds that system exceedingly
cumbrous by reason of the weight and bulk
of the Braille book. He has endeavored to
invent a means of overcoming this disadvan-
tage. Thurstantype, he claims, expresses
print in one-quarter of the space needed by
Braille, and one-sixtli of that bv Moon, and
he asserts it can be more quickly read. Any
effort in the direction of enabling the blind
to lessen their affliction by the solace of
reading will meet with the good wishes of
all who having eyes can see.
Extravagance of Imagination, by L.
George. An attack on certain forms of re-
ligion and a criticism of the present trend
of legislation. Adds little light to either.
’ Studies in Economics and Social Science,
by D. B. Copland (Macmillan ; Melbourne
University Press). The author, who is the
Professor of Commerce at Melbourne, was
able in an extensive tour of American and
European universities last year, as the guest
of the Laura Spelman Rockefeller Memorial,
to collect data, and, meeting many eminent
authorities, to discuss problems, connected
with the organisation of studies in social
science. The result of his labor is now pre-
sented in these essays. Of course, he recom-
mends the establishment of a Chair of
Economics and where possible a Chair of
Commerce in every university ; also a Chair
of Political Science and Public Administra-
tion.
Denied a Country, by Herman Bang
(Knopf; Robertson and Mullens). There is
a touch of poignancy behind the story of
this striking book. The leading character is
born on an island in the Danube, on the
borders of three countries. His home has
been for centuries a no-man’s land, acknow-
ledged by none of the neighboring govern-
ments. Denied a country, the hero, a violin
virtuoso, wanders over Europe, suffering;
the slings and arrows of contemptuous patri-
otism even from French crossing-sweepers
and Roumanian beggars. Bang, the Danish
author of the tale, put much of his own
experience in it. Born in Schleswig in 1857,
lie left his native country just before the
Prussians seized it. Denied a country, he
spent most of his life, which ended in 1012,
in trying to find a public. For writing in
patriotic Danish to a Copenhagen paper, he
was expelled from Berlin. For doing the
same thing in Vienna he was turned out of
Austria. The Danes were too busy reading
the works of foreigners in translation to
worry about Bang, who persisted in writing
in Danish. He died while on a reading tour
in America, whereupon his countrymen or
racial brothers proceeded to acclaim his
genius.

Capt. C. H. Peters, M.C., chairman of the
Victorian Booksellers’ Committee, writes to
The Bulletin :
Australian and N.Z. Authors’ Week has gone by
and on all sides we hear that it has been a success.
Such success was due in a very large part to the
co-operation accorded by The Bulletin.
May I be permitted, please, on behalf of my com-
mittee to thank you for it and to congratulate you
upon its success ?
It is very kind of Capt. Peters to put. -it
that way. For its part, the Red Page hs*
no hesitation in saying that the driving
force which made such a success of the
Week in Victoria was Capt. Peters.

Snugly lined with soft leather
built to a special Abbey design that
eliminates chafing and guarantees a
close, easy fit this is a hard-wear-
ing boot that withstands the rough-
est going.
The sole is of double thickness,
but pliant. The upper arches to lace
comfortably over the instep, as the
photo shows. At back of ankle it
is cut lower, which prevents bulg-
ing.
Such a boot cramps none of the
foot muscles. Its distinct comfort is
noticeable from the first time on.
No “breaking-in” is needed.

Roads of France.
I see the ribbon roadways
Go winding on and on
By field and dune in Flanders
And on to Polygon,
Where tiny crosses ever
Point, upward to the sky ;
But now these roads are lonely
Where once our sons marched by.
A thousand years they’ve trod you,
A million marching men:
They rode, o’er you to Crecy,
Their armor gleaming then ;
You saw the men of Agincourt,
Good knights of helm and lance;
You knew the men of Henry—
O wondrous Bonds of France!
You saw our Southern Diggers
r Go swinging o’er your breast;
You heard their carefree singing
As marched they to the test;
Where little orchards flourish,
Where blood-red poppies dance,
Shrines are you of our nation,
O blood-soaked Fields of France !
Now by your bends are slumbering
Our laughing Southern sons;
They take their rest forever
Where thundered once the guns;
Where once they sang their war-songs,
O Highway of Bomance,
By hill and field and orchard
They slumber, Boads of France !
• And sometimes in dark midnight
They tread your miles again ;
The dead of all your battles,
They march o’er hill and glen ;
The knights who fought at Crecy,
The men of helm and lance.
They march with Southern Diggers
Along the Boads of France.
From their deep graves at midnight
The dead of all years rise :
The thunder of their war-songs
Be-echoes to the skies;
The knights who died for Henry
Their ghostly war-steeds prance;
And with them march our Diggers—■
O magic Roads of France !

Old Sundays.
Ah, those sweet old Sundays, walking to the
meetings,
Through the homestead paddocks, across
the fescue grass;
Summer down the rutted tracks, neighbors’
smiles and greetings,
Glimmering in my memory like clear-spun
glass!
Deep the sleepy golden light along the valley
glowing;
Deep in lush green herbage the cattle stood
at ease,
Lifting up their lustrous eyes to watch our
going,
Underneath the dappled red and russet of
the trees.
Then my frilly frock would sweep its thick
white clover.
Then my mop of brown hair had a scarlet
ribbon tie;
All the bush birds whistled us, over still and
over.
Tags and snatches of the joy of earth and
air and sky.
Through the open window a lost bee blun-
dered,
Cooler grew the shadows with the closing
hymn.
“Will he see me home to-night, wait for
me?” I wondered,
When behind my mother’s back I used
to smile at Jim.
Heigh-ho for lads’ love, the old times are
over!
Still on summer dawnings, when the light
is breaking dim,
Often I will wonder, when the wind blows
off the clover,
V\ here is she that once was I, and what’s
become of Jim?

does it matter? Life is just an hour
I llched from a blinded Fate, nor all your
fears
May save one petal of that golden flower.
It withers and it dies. So save your tears.
The sunset will be just as red to-morrow.
Monotonously on the sea there glows
Ihe same round, vacant moon, and all your ;
sorrow
Is one with dusty road and dying rose.
Oh, stars don’t fall, and hearts are never
broken,
And life’s not life walled round with long
regrets.
Be glad for lips you’ve kissed, for words
you’ve spoken.

What does it matter? One reluctant finger

Sometimes I leave the human stream whose
mind
Is set on home: racked with the city day
I turn in from the old accustomed way
And wander up the marble stairs to find
Escape and joy, a hallowed peace enshrined
Beneath this noble dome where softly falls
The light on famous heads and storied
walls—
Who enters here may leave the world behind.
From soulless ledger pages I am free,
Omnipotent, a kingdom at my feet,
A magic realm to traverse at my will.
With thought and song, alas, the moments
flee;
But, out once more, far down the jangling
street,
The glamor of that hour is with me stiil.

The Enchantress.
Light, a strange enchantress is,
And with candies tali,
Throwing shadows on the floor,
Shadows on the wall,
Back I go to bygone times,
Back to children playing;
Boy again, and glad again,
Though my hair is greying.
O’er a threshold-stone I stop
From the outer gloom,
Shyly enter, shyly stand
In a lighted room—
In a room where candles tall,
Tall and palely glowing.
Flame and flicker in a draught
From the open, blowing.
As I stand within the door
Dazed by what I see,
Little folk with dancing eyes
Stretch their hands to me.
“So you’re back again,” they cry,
Merry-voiced and hearty ;
“Glad are we to have you here,
Joining our house-party.”
One with them I join their game,
While the candles tall,
Shadows throw upon the floor,
Shadows on the wall :
In that room from winter-winds,
Wintry frosts made cosy.
Bound and round and round we go,
Playing ring-a-rosy.
Kate, my little sweetheart Ivate,
Fronts me, eyes aglow.. ..
Didn’t someone say that Kate
Died long years ago ;
Died ere yet hoi- laughing life
Beached to full completeness.
Like a rose that scents the air,
Filled her world with sweetness?
Yonder Syd, my boy-mate, is
Bright of brow and glance....
Didn’t someone say he fell
At some war in France?
'Mazed am I, and sent astray
By yon candle’s gleaming—
Did he fall, and was there war,
Or have I been dreaming?
Boy am I, and glad again.
Children’s hands to h01d....
Who is it that whispers me,
“Gray you are and old!”
Lest brave youth forgotten be
Dreams are sent from Heaven,
And to-night, in spite of time,
I am just eleven.
Bound and round the rompers go,
While the candles tall
Throw their shadows on the floor,
Throw them on the wall;
Light and lively move their feet
Shod in shoes and sandals—
For this hour I spend with them
How I thank the candles!

Anniversary.
These are the colors I mourn them by:
Marigold yellow, and turquoise sky.
Amber of poppies and emerald grass,
Buds of yellow like beads of brass,
.lust as it was when I watched them go,
When I heard the passionate bugles blow,
i And saw the column of khaki march
| Over the hill where the cedars arch.
i These are the tokens I mourn them by,
They, and a million young to die.
The children play in the Soldiers’ Park
And 1 hear the wraith of a bugle—hark!
Echoing, echoing calling still!
The children play, and the b::.wn ghosts drill
And the bugle cries like a silver thread.
Sorrowing on for the Dead, ihe Dead!
Here are the colors I mourn them by:
Under the bowl of a turquoise sky
. Lacquer of yellow, and trampled grass,
*Oid a thin heat-haze like a sheet of glass;
A swirl of dust where the road unrolls
And the play of light through the cedar boles,
Just as it was on the day they went!
the years are gone, but the year has lent
Again the colors I mourn them by,
Marigold glory and turquoise sky!

COLLAPSE OF A RAILWAY SYSTEM.
South Australia, considering that the time
is ripe, has begun to discuss the financial
situation with considerable frankness. For
a long time the State ranked third for the
amount it owed per inhabitant, but having
left Queensland in the rear it has now only
Westralia in front of it. Since 1922 it has
acquired more additional net debt per head
than any of its competitors, but it hasn’t
yet overtaken the great western neighbor,
because the latter secured an early start.
At June, 1926, their net owings, apart from
their share of the Federal war liability,
were: S. Australia, £143 ss. 2d. per head;
Westralia, £l6O 6s. 9d. Now a matter which
has struck the S.A. Auditor-General, sup-
ported by the Railway Commissioner, is
the unprofitable uses to which much of the
loan money has been put. A common im-
pression is that it is almost entirely invested
in railways, and that these “open up the
country” and “promote settlement,” where-
fore they are good and paying investments.
As a matter of fact, State railways and
tramways now stand for less than half the
State debts, and taken in the aggregate
they ceased to pay interest and working
expenses 12 years ago.
* * * *
In 1914 S. Australia possessed railways
which, valued with a considerable disregard
of depreciation, represented £46 14s. out of
every £lOO of debt, the rest of the assets
being w'ater supply and sewerage (£l9 14s.
out of every £100) and sundries —very
sundry sundries. Now the debt is over
2-V times what it was in 1914, and so much
of the new money has been spent on odd-
ments that there is only a nominal £34
Bs. worth of railway to set against each
£lOO of liability. The figures for 1914
alleged that the year’s railway takings
covered working expenses and interest (in-
terest was £3 13s. 7d. per cent, then) and
provided in addition £264,989 to help the
lame dogs of the Public Works Department
over the stile. But for the year to June,
1927, the railway receipts were £1,118,252
short of expenses and interest. (Interest,
thanks to much borrowing in bad markets,
was £5 Is. per cent, then.) Adding
£399,360 charged for “relaying, reballasting,
rebuilding shops” and other alterations, the
loss became £1,517,612. The further addi-
tion of a ghost from the past described as
“Recoups to capital for worn-out and obso-
lete assets and depreciation on rolling stock,
£1,562,719” raised the total debit for the
year to £3,080,331, or between £5 and £6
per inhabitant. The S. Australian railways
have really ceased, for the time at all
events, to pay any interest, and from the
standpoint of receipts and expenditure alone
it would be a saving to close the lot, unless
someone knows how to make a great im-
provement. This is the second year that an
alarmed and awakened department has
devoted to cleaning up, these being the
results:—
Loss Old Losses and Total
for Year. Depreciations. Loss Shown.
1925- .. £56,206 £3,982,314 £4,038,520
1926- .. 1,118,252 1,962,079 3,080,331
The position is that the temporary ghost
wasn’t anything like so bad last year as the
one before, and in fact it is stated that all
the 50 years’ accumulation of belated and
concealed liabilities has now been written
off, though by no means paid off (Austra-
lian Governments don’t pay off things like
that), so that the elder spook is technically
off the premises. But the Spectre That Has
Come to Stay has grown and still grows
alarmingly. For instance, the 44-hour week
didn’t operate last year, though it does now,
thanks to the usual two-to-one majority
decision of the Federal Court.
* * * 4=
A number of causes are assigned for what
is frankly described as the collapse of the
railways. Among them tyre improved
working conditions, increased wages and
shortened hours (shortened, that is to say,
before the recent decision further abbrevi-
ated them); great increase in the cost of
coal; increased motor competition, con-
ducted on roads partly constructed with
borrowed money; and the insatiable Aus-
tralian desire to build lines in haste, for
“development,” or to absorb the unem-
ployed, or to help some politician at elec-
tion time, “although most of this added
mileage does not even earn sufficient to pay
working expenses, and little new and addi-
tional traffic is provided.” The mineral
traffic returns show a decrease, for Broken
Hill isn’t immortal, and revenue in general
is a little lower. The overwhelming matter
is that no railway system has more than
a dog’s chance when it is mortgaged for
millions more than it is worth to private
capitalists, who have to be paid in that
scarce commodity, gold, and when the
interest is £5 Is. per cent, and rising like
an escaped balloon. The private line pays
nofhing to its capitalists when times are
bad, and the Government line which is
free, or practically free of debt (such things
exist but not here), only needs to earn bare
expenses.
* * * *
Australia must enter on‘a struggle to do
some real repayment or else break some-
where and somehow. The first essential
is to greatly reduce the number of men em-
ployed on public-works-building jobs, and
to get them by some means into factories,
to do work which will combat the import-
ing disease. Australia possesses six State
railway systems and four detached Federal
lines. The only one which has the ghost
of a hope to pay its way this year is the
five-mile stretch which joins un the drinks
of Queanbeyan with the drought of Can-
berra, and its doings aren’t taken seriously.
When great utilities do so badly, there is
small hope that such loan “assets” as
“immigration,” “public buildings” and
“other public works and purposes” will pay
their way. The melancholy situation is
going to be reflected in the tax bills at an
early date. S. Australian State (peace)
taxation was 335. per inhabitant in 1914
and it has risen to 98s. If it goes up to
1325. it may balance the accounts, though
there is no certainty even of that.
CLEANING UP JOBS FOR A NEW
MINISTRY.
When a new tenant moves into the house
there is generally some cleaning to be done,
and the incoming Government of N. S.
Wales inherits an outsize job in that way.
It will begin with the chronic woe of a
Treasury in difficulties. When the recent
Disreputables assumed office on June 17,
1925, because Fuller was too short-sighted
to see the dangers of undue haste in retire-
ment, they had 13 clear days in which to
manufacture an alleged deficit for their pre-
decessors, by paying every possible bill and
collecting as little as possible. When they
saw their end coming about May, 1927, they
reversed the process by collecting every-
thing possible and paying nothing which
could be avoided, so that the Slangs and
the Whangs might declare a big surplus
on June 30, and talk about it for election
purposes. Since then the surplus has
vanished and turned into a deficit, and
there are no arrears to collect and plenty
to pay. The community to which the new
Ministry becomes guardian is demoralised
by much spending, for the £19,236,674 of
loan money which drifted in and out
during 1926-27 was a world’s record for a
State of N.S.W.’s population in peace time,
and has seldom been equalled in war time;
and the spending can’t go on. And an un-
employed problem has begun to give serious
trouble.
* * *
This unemployed problem is due to
various causes besides the usual ones, among
them being increased wages (including a
rural basic wage handed out by a com-
mission which refused to hear evidence),
shortened hours, workmen’s insurance and
child endowment. A very urgent business
is to find different means of financing the
last named. At present the burden falls
wholly on the employer, and more particu-
larly on the employer who pays good wages,
for the more he pays the more he has to
pay. An industrial commissioner with
£3500 per annum certain may keep his lia-
bility under both insurance and child en-
dowment down to £lO a year if he likes to
live unostentatiously, while the manufacturer,
in some line where competition is keen, may
make £l5OO nominal profit and receive a
bill for four-fifths of it. The importer is
charged little provided he sticks to im-
porting and sells only what is not Made in
Australia, for a purely importing staff isn’t
large; and the bookmaker needn’t be
charged anything. For raw insanity com-
bined with crude malevolence, the Slang
Government’s device is almost without an
equal. The case might be treated by levy-
ing a small contribution on wages received
instead of on wages paid. This is to some
extent the method in Great Britain, where
for males over 18 the payments for health
and unemployment insurance and old-age
pensions are Is. sd. per week from the
employer and Is. 4d. from the employee,
and' the State contributes something.
* -Ts i|i *
It appears very definitely that the judg-
ments of industrial courts should be made
subject to appeal; and, in addition to what
State Parliaments can do, the Federal
authority should be urged to attempt some-
thing with its tribunal before it hands out
a universal 40- or 36-hour week, and sits
down to gloat over its handiwork. The
sensational collapse of the S. Australian
railway finances is a sign of bad trouble
ahead. Then the incoming N.S.W. Govern-
ment has something which calls for early
attention in the invention of an Upper
House which will be paid, will represent the
people, and will not be a mere duplicate of
the Assembly. The most sensible idea is
to make it a body elected by the State as
one constituency, the State being the only
constituency which can’t be gerrymandered.
Haste is essential here, too, because if the
idea gets abroad that time is no object, the
Composite party may split up into faddy
little factions each pursuing its own fad,
and the chance may pass like so many
chances before it. And it is more essential
because no one can foresee how long it may
take to persuade the existing Second
Chamber to extinguish itself. Therefore the
Ma State should get its new Upper House,
and hold the referendum afterwards if
anyone can show that a newer House is
desirable. It is taken for granted that the
Government w r on’t falter in its decision to
suspend the Sydney Municipal Council and
place the city under the rule of commis-
sioners. The municipal institution is a
vulgar, brawling scandal.
* * *
The electoral law requires straightening
in various places. The man who is moved
to a strange electorate just before an elec-
tion should take half a year instead of one
month to qualify for a vote for his new
tent or whatever it may be. This would
give him time to become acquainted with
his road-making job. The law would also
be improved if every sentence for serious
crime carried with it the loss of voting
rights for a fairly long period. The poli-
tician would be less anxious to secure the
release of William Sikes if William had
no vote to give as -a token of gratitude,
and in any case William is no desirable
law-maker. The great mass of recent Gov-
ernment appointees require, and will doubt-
less receive, a strenuous weeding out. Some-
thing drastic should be done with the Fair
Rents law, which has made the supplying
of houses to rent so unprofitable that
Sydney, according to a prominent Labor
member, is 30,000 homes short, and getting
shorter. Considering the deafening activity
and the noisy threatenings of imported revo-
lutionists and strife-makers, the State law of
deportation, which worked strongly enough
when put to the test, might well be fur-
bished up and placed on a war footing. It
is dispiriting to read that some European
country has chased out 400 or 500 alien
Communists while N.S.W, deports none and
fails to obtain common civility from any.
As a side-issue appeals are already being
made to the incoming Government to pre-
serve the sacred right of free speech, and
not to sully its escutcheon by smothering
debate—as its predecessor did all the time,
The idea is, ol course, that nothing should
pass until every Opposition member has
spoken at full length. It is to be hoped
that the incoming Government will allow
freedom of speech just far enough to be
reasonable, and will then smother the rest
of the way and chance its escutcheon. A
good beginning would be to smother the
debate on the Address-in-Reply.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Nationalist Superstitions.
The N.S.W. Nationalists had a great chance
on October 8 to gain such a majority as
would keep the other side out of office for
at least six years. The other side was a
house divided against itself, and the Nation-
alists had only to contend against a very
poor Government with a very bad record,
a very inferior lot of candidates and no
newspaper backing, apart from its Labor
Daily. Yet Bavin’s party could only win
35 of the 90 Leg. Assembly seats. If Jaques
and Sanders are Independents, as York-
street asserted before the numbers went up
(its “campaign director” heatedly described
them as “impostors”), the Nationalists did
not gain a seat. Yet they had 43 Assembly-
men in the last Parliament but one.
It is claimed that the Lang-Lazzarini
electoral redistribution was unfavorable to
the Nationalists; and in some districts it
was. But it was far more unfavorable to
the Country party, which succeeded where
York-street failed. The Cocky party ran can-
didates for 16 seats, nine of which showed
Labor majorities at the 1925 election, and
won 13—a gain ot six seats really, for the
redistribution deprived it of two. In
Monaro it defeated Stokes, the Labor Min-
ister of Agriculture, who had a 1925 majority
of 476. Moreover, it very nearly wiped
out Flannery’s 1925 majority of 1109 in
Murrumbidgee and Hoad’s 1925 majority of
845 in Cootamundra.
Compared with this fine Cocky achieve-
ment the Nationalists did badly. On 1925
figures they had 625 votes to the good in
Ryde, yet Ryde was lost. In Bankstown,
Canterbury, Granville, St. George, Lakemba
and other suburban electorates the small
Labor majorities of two years ago were sub-
stantially increased. In each of these cases,
and others where the result was equally dis-
mal, the Nat. Fed. ran one pre-selected can-
didate, a former Labor conscriptionist pre-
ferred. The Nationalist poll was relatively
much greater where the electors had an
alternative to the York-street nominee. In
Bondi and Willoughby, for example, the
1925 Nationalist majorities were increased
by several thousands. The York-street pre-
diction that Bondi, Willoughby, Dulwich
Hill and Drummoyne were endangered by
the candidature of Nationalists opposed to
Tire-selection was, in fact, ridiculously falsi-
fied. The probabilities are that if two can-
didates had been endorsed in Ryde, Wool-
lahra, Bankstown. St. George and Lakemba,
at least two of these seats would have
been won.
The National Federation will have to
drop pre-selection and with it the notion
that people will vote for exploded ex-
Labor politicians because they did some-
thin'! or other during a foolish referendum
in 1916. If it doesn’t shed both silly beliefs
it will be routed the first time it goes up
against a reorganised Labor party.

Problems That Must Be Faced.
Australia was not a coward in Palestine
or in France, but at home it shows a re-
markable indisposition to face its diffi-
culties. One of the most serious of these
is the heavy and rapidly-growing loss on
the operation of its trains and trams, largely
the result of motor traffic on the roads.
To every suggestion that this traffic should
pay for the making and upkeep of its
roads there is a howl that we must not
interfere with the march of progress. This
talk of progress is merely drawing a large
herring across the track. Railways repre-
sent progress just as much as motor-cars do.
yet it has never been seriously suggested
that those who use the railways should not
pay for the laying and maintenance of the
tracks. It is quite safe to say that five-
sixths of the damage done to Australian
roads is due to motor traffic, and five-sixths
of all the money spent on Australian roads
is spent in order that motor traffic may
have the sort of roads it wants. Why should
it not pay for this costly service? Why
should not the motor-user pay for the mak-
ing of the road he uses as well as for the
making of the car or truck he uses? Why
should he not pay for the road he consumes
as well as for the petrol he consumes? To
talk of interfering with the march of pro-
gress is as absurd as it would be for the
motor-user to say that Henry Ford inter-
feres with the march of progress because he
charges something for his Lizzie.
Nor is it any answer at all to say that a
great deal of the traffic is for the service
of ratepayers. As a matter of fact, in-
creasingly little of the traffic is for the ser-
vice of the ratepayers of the district through
which it passes. In any case, there is nothing
at all in the plea. Most of the goods
carried from one point to another on the
railways are for the use of taxpayers; but
nobody asks that they should therefore not
be required to' pay their way.
The suggestion that the users of motor
vehicles are bitterly opposed to paying
directly for such service as the construction


and maintenance of roads is quite without
truth. Some few years ago a bridge was built
across Middle Harbor at the Spit, just out-
side Sydney, to displace the free Govern-
ment punts theretofore run. Against all
precedent, so far as N. S. Wales is con-
cerned, it was made a toll bridge; and so
far from the owners of the tens of thou-
sands of vehicles which use it protesting
against the small charge, there has been
an almost universal hallelujah. The trouble
lies not with the users of motor vehicles,
but with the politicians. They have got so
into the habit of corrupting the constituen-
cies that nowadays they won’t do anything
which they think may cost them a vote;
and they see lost votes where there are
none. In plain words, the politicians be-
lieve the constituencies are much more
corrupt than they really are.
This paper does not suppose that to
compel motor traffic to pay for the use of
its roads will put the railways and tramways
on their feet again. But it will remove one
element of most unfair competition. To
bring the rails and trams back to the self-
supporting stage it will be necessary to
restore backbone and honesty to politicians.
If railways under State management can-
not serve the public reasonably, and especi-
ally the producer, whether he be farmer in
the country or manufacturer in the town,
then we shall have to face the question
whether the country can afford to allow the
railways to remain under State management.
The whole fabric of State socialism falls
to pieces if State enterprise means waste
and loafing. The reason most of us advo-
cated it in the past was that we believed
it would be an aid to private enterprise,
such as farming. If it is a handicap and
not an aid, then there is nothing to be
said for it from the general public’s point
of view.
O
Financial Scribes and Labor Pharisees.
When Federal Treasurer Page met Parlia-
ment with a Loan Bill for 13 millions or
so, he did a dismal thing; but, all the same,
the roar of protest which the Opposition
put up was unconvincing. It was sham and
hypocrisy on a huge scale, with a consider-
able amount of ignorance and some lack of
veracity thrown in.
As an instance, Scullin declared that
“when the Fisher Labor Government was
in power it carried out all works from
revenue.” As a matter of truth, the Minis-
tries of Barton, Deakin (there were three
Deakin Cabinets), Watson and Reid-
McLean all paid for works out of revenue,
while Fisher, without any war troubles to
excuse him, set the Loan Fund going in
1912 and repeated the deed in 1913. There-
by he lighted a candle which hasn’t been
put out, as a famous martyr said, and which
now burns at both ends. And, starting
with Fisher, a situation has developed
which is partly of the Federal Treasurers’
making and mostly the making of other
people—a situation of quaint, grotesque,
unprecedented muddle which seems impos-
sible anywhere save in Australia.
The situation could be improved out of
sight if Australia, by a policy of more work,
more production, less holiday, less luxury
and less strike and Redfiaggery, had a
handsome surplus of exports with which to
pay its way, as it did in every year between
1901 and 1912, also in 1917, 1918, 1919 and
1920. But if it was proposed to scrap the
44 hours, and the five-day week, and the
Navigation Act and a few other hindrances,
the wrath of the Scullin mob would sug-
gest Vesuvius doing its worst. And it offers
no alternative proposition, unless it is a
plan for m;.king everything worse as soon
as possible.
“Poor Cow, Me!”
Dear Bulletin, —Can’t anything be done
about the canker that appears to be eating
into our Australian national spirit? I mean
the recently-developed “inferiority com-
plex.” A large section of the Labor party
look to Moscow for salvation; all brands
of politicals hang on to England’s apron-
strings for protection against any possible
foreign foe; and the majority of the public
turn eyes of puerile admiration towards
America, and say: “Ah! What a glorious
countrv this would be if only the Yanks
had it!”
A few weeks ago I was being driven
through some of the finest sheep-country in
the Upper North of South Aus., which,
though suffering from a moderate drought,
•was still sending a fine clip to market.
Beside me was a Digger who knew a bit
about farming in the South, but very little
about the class of country we were in-
north of Hawker. He was no fool; I dis-
covered, incidentally, that he had been
reading “Plutarch’s Lives” and Gibbon’s
“Decline and Fall” for nastime. Yet he
came out with the same cry: “What a great
thing the Yanks would make of this coun-
try if they had it!” I told him the story
of the American Chaffey brothers, who
mistook a mirage for a lake while on their
first tour of the Riverina. After that he
agreed that it might be their money rather
than their brains that we would have use
for.
In the city it is the same, only worse. I
make a practice of demanding Australian-
made wearing apparel when I go to my
clothiers. But I always have a fight to get
it; they try their damnedest to make me
take English tweeds, American boots and
hats and German or Japanese fancy-goods.
“Yes, we have an Australian make, Doctor,
but— you know! We ca-an’t make the
same quality that Spoofenstein sends out!”
“Blessed are the poor in spirit”; but not
this side of Jordan. —Yours. Dr. Nil.

The Heathen in His Blindness.
There is more than a whiff of the bad old
blackbirding days of the Western Pacific in
the story of the massacre of District-Com-
missioner Bell, with his white assistant,
Kenneth Lillies, and a number of native
police, on Malaita, in the Eastern Solomons.
Time was when such happenings were a
commonplace. Not as related to white
officialdom and Government authority, for
that was non-existent then, but to the com-
paratively unimportant cases of the white
trader, the missionary and the adventurers
who manned the fleet sailing out of a
dozen Queensland ports under the “Black
Ball,” which, hoisted at the mainmast head,
was the ensign of the ships recruiting South
Sea Island labor for Queensland stations
and sugar plantations.
Nowadays things are different; and,
besides, the present case is exceptional. No
wiping-out of white authority on this scale
has occurred in the Western Pacific since
Resident-Magistrate Green was killed by
the Papuans—and that was 30 years ago.
So the newspapers have broadcast the
tidings with trimmings, and a National
Government has been stirred to take what
in all honesty seems exaggerated action. An
Australian cruiser has been rushed off to
enforce law and order in a country which is
blandly indifferent to both, and to ensure
that justice be done on the guilty parties,
if it ever becomes possible to determine
them—alleged to be the natives of Sinerago.
From the very beginnings of the white
man’s dealings with the Solomons, the Mal-
ayans have been accounted the most dan-
gerous and treacherous of Western Pacific
peoples. Even the sandalwood cutter, most
daring—and brutal —of all Island adven-
turers, balked at Malaita. There the beach-
comber occasionally sprang up as a flower,
and at evening was cut down. An excep-
tionally optimistic trader tried his luck
occasionally, and went his appointed way in
short order. The Malaitans, warring sav-
agely among themselves, were at odds with
all intruders. Masters of poisoning and tin;
black art, they permitted only the visits of
students of these mysteries from other parts
of the Solomons, for the sake of the fees
they paid, and gave them safe conduct.
Treachery was their watchword, and murder
in its foulest forms their obsession. It is
curious to recall, in this regard, that the
Malaitan, when transferred to a sheep-
station or cane plantation, was accounted
among the most faithful of his kind.
And in all Malaita, Sinerago stands out
as the bright, particular jewel. It steps into
recorded history in 1883, when the Janet
Stewart, of Queensland, put in to recruit.
The recruiting party went off in two whale-
boats; when they returned they found that
the Government Agent, G. A. Lockhead,
with all left on board, save one, had been
chopped to pieces. The survivor, the cook,
had hid in a half-empty water-tank. Two
years later the Flora, from Brisbane, was
standing in to Sinerago, when she saw the
Young Dick, another labor vessel, passing
out of the inlet on the other tack. The
late Douglas Rannie, Government Agent
on the Flora, was annoyed to miss a meet-
ing with his friend Popiiam, who was Gov-
ernment Agent on the Young Dick. He
was soon to receive a disturbing reminder
of his friend. The Flora anchored off Sin-
erago and sent the boats in, as usual. But
there was no business. The natives were
sullen. Suddenly Rannie noticed one of the
brooding crowd was wearing a gold chain
and locket which he at once recognised as
Popham’s. The end of that story was heard
when the Flora returned to Queensland
some months later. Once more the amiable
natives had enticed away the armed boats
with promises of recruits, while others,
amiarently unarmed, remained to trade.
The mate, Mares, was trading with the
chief, when the old gentleman gave the
signal for attack by seizing Mares’s finger
in his mouth and biting it off. The other
local citizens drew their tomahawks from
the food bundles in which they had been
concealed and got busily to work on the
vessel’s crew. Down in the forecastle able-
seaman Crittenden was awakened from
sleep by the noise. Realising what had
happened, he seized a rifle and a bag of
cartridges, made a rush for the fore-rigging
and gained the topsail yard. From there he
shot down native after native till the sur-
vivors abandoned the ship.
As was always done in such cases, a man-
o’-war—the Opal in this instance—shelled
the mountain-side and burned a few native
houses. The more pretentious visit of the
Australian cruiser promises results no more
satisfactory. Such a case as that of Sinerago
must be dealt with from within. That
Malaita is practically in the condition of
lawlessness that it was 40 years ago must
be accounted to the methods of the Colo-
nial Office. It is admitted that the Adminis-
tration has little hold inland, and that most,
of the work has been confined to the beach;
and the same is true of most of the other
islands of the group. Even little Malaita
has been crossed only once, and many of
the other islands not even that. Yet Papua
has long ago solved the problem of bringing
such people to heel. The policy has been
peaceful and persistent penetration, till the
country, far larger and no less “difficult”
than Malaita, has been criss-crossed with
the tracks of Government patrols, and the
authority of the white man has become an
accepted fact in the wildest native’s
existence. The sooner the sinews of war
are found for a larger staff and a more defi-
nite policy of opening up the Solomons, the
better ior all concerned —and the better for
the reputation of the C.O.

An American Boycott.
Blood is thicker than water and ties of kin-
ship should not be sneezed at, but Uncle
Samuel knows where to draw the line
between sentiment and business—and he
draws it close up to the knuckle. A. H.
Baile, one of the many fine bandmasters Aus-
tralia has produced, has found out all about
it. He took a band—a remarkably good
band—to Canada, but arriving three weeks
too soon went over the border and gave
some concerts in the States of Washington
and Oregon. The band pleased the Yankees,
and some of the newspapers placed it above
John Philip Sousa's world-famous aggre-
gation. It was blasphemy, of course, and
100 per cent. Americans shuddered. They
had their revenge later. Baile went back
to Canada and fulfilled his engagements
with credit and renown. While there he
received tempting offers from an American
amusement corporation, and wanted to
accept contracts for a series of concerts in
Uncle Sam's domain. But he couldn’t. The
North American Federation of Musicians
put its foot down flat and announced that
it wasn’t going to allow “foreigners” to com-
pete with American bandsmen. What the
N.A.F.M. says goes, and Baile came back
to Australia.
As O. Henry made one of his characters
say: “111 fares the land with a great deal of
velocity where it’s all freetrade and no re-
ciprocity.” In the entertainment line Aus-
tralia plays the freetrade game with Uncle
Sam. It welcomes his actors, actresses,
vaudevillians, musicians and lecturers, and
the idea of boycotting such individuals has,
never entered the head of any sane Aus-
tralian. Sousa’s band was received with
open arms, and Santrey’s jazz orchestra and
minor organisations of the same sort have
been allowed to reap golden harvests in
this country without a cross word from any-
one. Sam has told us, and not too politely
either, in the case of the Commonwealth
Band and others, that we are too soft in
such matters. He is right. We are. A good
stiff duty on Yankee fillums, coupled with a
searching investigation into the manner in
which so many astute American corpora-
tions evade taxation in this fair land, seems
to be indicated as the first item in a pro-
gramme which so good a judge as Uncle
himself has recommended to us.

The Good Works of Hogan.
Five years ago Victoria acquired a law by
which the elusive and often nefarious estate-
agent had to be licensed and procure a
fidelity bond, so that if he turned swindler,
or simply remained the swindler he had
always been, there would be someone foi
the swindlee to recover from. It did good,
but nothing like as much as the easy-going
Lawsons and Allancocks expected. This
is evidenced by, among other matters,
Premier Hogan's statement that he has
tracked a person who has agented under
30 different names in two years.
Hogan’s new bill provides that every sort
of agent must apply for and obtain a
license, the application being made at the
nearest court, where there is a chance of the
applicant being known to the police and
others, and that he must provide a fidelity
bond. This inclusive way of doing things
will take in, among others, the business-
agent, who is often a great deal worse than
the man who sells and/or lets properties;
and the employment-agent, who is as sharky
as either of them; and the partner-
ship-agent, who is mostly a liar from the
ground up; and the hotel-broker, who tries
to be in a class by himself because he brakes
instead of agenting. It also includes the
auctioneer, who will require an additional
permit if he deals in businesses or allot-
ments, and any person who has heard one
of the breed lying about quarter-acre blocks
on a pleasant Saturday afternoon must
realise that he requires something. In
addition, separate licenses are to be
obtained and separate fidelity bonds pro-
vided by each of the boss agent’s partners,
including the sleeping partner, who may
really be the biggest feature of the show
and be sleeping with one eye open; and by
his sub-agents, salesmen and dummies in
general. The security is to be a genuine
and solvent policj^—the kind that a big
insurance company issues after inquiring
into a would-be customer’s previous con-
victions —and not at all like the bail docu-
ment, signed by an impecunious fellow-
criminal, which satisfies the senile Mel-
bourne J.P. at any hour of the day or
night.
The measure doesn’t give the bowled-
out middleman a second chance, and he
shouldn’t get one. Premier Hogan be-
lieves that his legislation will prevent the
disqualified or unfrocked shark starting
again under the name of his wife or his
aunt or his grandmother, and if it escapes
violent amendment, it probably will, pro-
vided a well-paid and efficient staff is
charged with the administration.
An admiring member told Hogan that
his law would drive a lot of bad men to
Sydney, so there is call for the new Govern-
ment in N. S. Wales to also go d-Hogan-
ing.
The Slap-Bang Endowment Scheme.
There are many muddles connected with
the N.S.W. Family Endowment Act which
the defeated Slap-Bang Ministry rushed
through as an election advertisement,
among them being that neithei time noi
care was soent on the training of a staff.
For instance, the Act says (pp 10 and 11)
that endowment is collectable unless
“the family income in the 12 months im-
mediately preceding the date of the claim
exceeded the aggregate of the following
amounts namely—the amount for one year
of the living wage based on the requirements
of a man and wife without children and for
the time being in force and appropriate to
the case and the amount of £l3 for each
child in the family. . . .
“For the purposes of this Act ‘family
income’ means the combined incomes of a
claimant, his spouse and children under the
age of 14 years”....
Then on page 12 it is set forth that the
“family income” shall not include sick
allowances or funeral benefit money, fire
insurance compensation, workmen’s com-
pensation or superannuation money, over-
time pay or war pension; nor
“the earnings of a child under the age of 14
years; nor. the earnings of a mother from
casual employment.”
It is somewhat mixed, but it certainly
appears that if the father, mother and two
young children enjoy among them the basic
wage fixed for a childless couple and 10s.
per week over (£l3 a year for each child),
and the mother doesn’t earn her share by
“casual employment,” that family qualifies,
but subject to the fact (also on page 11)
that it only qualifies for, say, ss. per week
if the “family income” is ss. below the
amount specified above. But in a case
which came under The Bulletin’s notice
the claimant, who has a pair of small
children, was ruled out at the first stage
of the conflict because she has also off-
spring aged between 14 and 20, who are
earning a little money, and because she is
herself in casual employment- at laundry
work and domestic helping. In addition to
its remark about “casual employment” the
statute declares rather irrelevantly (on pa,ge
4) that the term “employee” does not in-
clude any person employed in domestic
service, or whose employment is casual or
intermittent, and who is employed other-
wise than for the purposes of his employer’s
trade or business. That seems to shut the
results of the lady’s casual occupation out
from consideration a second time by stat-
ing that for the purposes of the Act she
isn’t occupied at all. Still by reckoning in
her own and the elder children’s wages the
household was ruled out of the endowment
by a narrow margin.
It is possible that a multitude of deserv-
ing cases have the same ill-luck because
some referee hasn’t learned the rules of
the game—which are mixed.

Shell Shock.
“Slinga”: It is only within the life of the
present adult generation that a scientific
investigation of the psychology of the
human race has been attempted. The
science of psychiatry is practically a pro-
duct of the Great War. The investigations
of Freud and Jung are of somewhat earlier
date, but the conclusions —if they may be so
called —are of doubtful value, and around
the temple of psycho-analysis there hangs
a mist of suspicion.
There can be no question, however, of
the value of psychotherapy in those cases
of the loss of mental, moral or psycho-
logical equilibrium which, during the war,
were loosely designated “shell shock.”
The art of medicine is coeval almost
with the human race. Centuries before
Galen, witch doctors, priests, “wise women”
and the like attempted to cure the ills of
the flesh. Since Galen’s time thousands
of his successors have “practised” the art on
millions of sufferers. Despite the fact that
many of his and their theories were wildly
incorrect, yet there was a groping—often in
the dark, but still a groping towards the
light.
In those years of torture, misery and
death the art of medicine gradually began
to assume the form of a science, and within
the memory of men still living came the
great idea that the chief aim of the medical
profession should be to prevent disease.
So much for the Body; now for the Mind.
The success of psychiatry in dealing with
certain classes of neuroses, particularly
those caused or aggravated by the war,
leads one to ask whether the profession
cannot now investigate the of
these distressing ailments.
The writer was through the war from
first to last, on three fronts and for the
greater part of the time with fighting units,
and can therefore write feelingly of the
pitiful sight presented by a man coming
out of the . line badly shaken, badly “shell
shocked” as we then called it.
Now, my argument is this. Since the
“mental doctors”—psychiatrists, alienists,
call them what you will—can do so much
to alleviate, and even in some cases to cure,
these psychological lesions, cannot they go
a step further, many steps further, and pre-
vent, them? In the war, if a man became
unfit, through physical disability existent
before enlistment, one rightly blamed the
medical officer who had passed him as fit.
Is it too much to ask to-day that a bad
mental or psychological breakdown on the
part of an individual should be blamed on
the psychiatrist who passed him as psy-
chologically fit?
It is not a question for me to answer;
I am merely a soldier. But if such an elimi-
nation of the psychologically unfit could be
made, the benefits to the fighting forces
would perhaps be as great as those arising
from the discoveries of the medical pro-
fession in the direction of vaccination and
prophylaxis.

POLITICAL
POINTS
On a rough estimate the minimum amount
of new loans which the State and Common-
wealth Governments require to raise in Lon-
don and New York is in the neighborhood
of £27,000,000 a year. This is to pay
interest and sinking fund on old loans, in
the absence of any surplus of exports to
satisfy creditors with. Tiie Bulletin has
mentioned, among other things, the making
of a long list of prohibited imports in order
to violently reduce outgoings. It has also
mentioned that the Federal Government
might buy up, with paper money, as much
produce each year as would meei the interest
bill when sold for good money. These may
be crude devices, but the Commonwealth
Government and the Loan Council have pro-
duced no device at all.
A legend goes round that on the day
after the State election results were known
a Sydney alderman held out his hand behind
his back, palm upwards, and that a burning
cigar was put into it instead of a present.
The pending transaction was cancelled, of
course. The moral conveyed is that people
who have dealings with aldermen are taking
courage with the hope of a better time
coming.
Tasmania has furnished a startling excep-
tion to the general run of Royal Commis-
sions. While Crisp, J., was inquiring into
the administration of the Public Trust Office,
solicitor Okines, Attorney-General Ogilvie’s
partner, committed suicide. Now the Judge’s
comments on Ogilvie. particularly his refer-
ences to a loan of £5OOO on a hotel in which
the young man was interested, have led to
the A.-G.’s retirement from the Ministry.
Ogilvie is one of the members for Franklin,
as also is J. P. Piggott, at whose instance
the inquiry was launched.
Peter Loughlin lost the Young (N.S.W.)
seat to the Country party man after a very
gallant fight. Had McTiernan been on his
side when the Parliamentary Labor leader-
ship was put to the vote last year, Loughlin
would have become Premier and might have
remained Premier for years. For country
electors wouldn’t have turned against a
Labor Government led by Loughlin as they
did against Lang and his Sydney and New-
castle “industrialists.” Because McTiernan
was too loyal to the ungrateful Lang, he,
Loughlin, Dooley, Cann, Minalian and
Murphy are out of politics; Mutch and
Evatt are out of the party as now controlled;
and Labor is out of office. That one vote
certainly made history.
rn, , . . . . , , ,
The most miportant of the projected
changes in the Maonland tariff—the 3d -a-
foot impost on L.S cinema films and the
reduction of some of the duties on motor-
bodies—are not to be made, attcr all. Cus-
toms Minister Stewart, explaining the recan-
conclusion that there were not sufficient
British films offering to justify him col-
lecting more than the usual Id. a foot on
American celluloid. In the other instance,
the M.L. bodymakers had raised a roar, and
he had taken pity on them. In short, the
Government has a warm heart, but its feet
get cold.
Harry Chauvel, Inspector-General of the
C.M.L 1 ., has reported once more that Aus-
tralia’s preparations for defence by air and
land are tragically inadequate in every re-
spect. One point he makes is that only
42,000 youths are receiving military train-
ing of a sort, although more than twice the
number should be available, the population
being 6,120,000. Possibly the missing
50,000 or 60,000 are “absorbed” in “public
works” to “relieve the unemployed.” The
THE FIRST STEP.
“Although ridiculed by some authorities, the Adelaide proposal that an Aboriginal State should
be established in Australia, so that the natives might work out their own salvation, is likely to be
the subject of debate in the Federal Parliament."
BINGHI (with ambitions): “Gibbit spats, boss.”
money wasted on public works “to relieve
the unemployed” would suffice for a substan-
tial army.
That Vic. House of Landlords is not
friendly to Hogan and co. was indicated by
the way in which it heaved out the Milk
Board Bill. Jones was absent when the
measure was defeated by 15 votes to 10 ; he
was away at Canberra attending the Loan
Council. His personal influence will count
for somethin 0 * when the taxation proposals
come on, but he will be never free from
anxiety when finance is discussed in the
Uppali Chambali.
S. Australia’s railway surplus of £58,864
in 1924-25 turned into a loss of £1,118,253
in 1926-27, and several millions of old depre-
ciation also came to light. The loss was
largely due to concessions and benefits
granted to the staff under Federal awards. A
foreman at the railway workshops was
darkly suspected of “speeding up” by way
of helping to make good the deficiency, and
the usual strike followed, with the usual
subsequent complications. If they multiply
S.A. may have to do without the use of its
railways for a while. Still the Gulf ports
can do a lot of trade if the little boats can
be kept running, and Australia had 390.300
motor vehicles at June, 1926, against 110.357
in 1920. The figure should be approaching
the half-million mark now. Many of them
are partly unpaid for, but then the railways
aren’t paid for at all.
The Commonwealth Band, which went
touring in Canada and the U.S., returned
in a frozen-out condition. The difficulty was
that it couldn’t do much, good in the States
without being admitted to the union, and
the union wouldn’t let its members in. This
was considered the action of a nark, but as
narks will be narks discussion is wasted.
The best course is to keep a diary of the
nasty things which are done to Australians
in various countries, and so far as possible,
and so far as these countries are concerned,
to do likewise. Then a better feeling will
begin to prevail.
N.S.W. municipal and shire councils are
never in a state of affluence, and when the
endowment-tax was added to workmen’s
insurance and other concessions they began
to wear a hungry look. They may increase
their incomes when they next strike a rate,
but meanwhile the simple device is to try
to do with 25 per cent, fewer employees
and let things go to the dogs for a while. An
alarming number of people in N.S.W. are
going to have long holidays without pay
unless the new Government makes haste to
shift at least some of the burden of child
endowment off the wage-paying class, which
now carries it all, or drops child endow-
ment altogether.
Maoriland’s Reform party is shocked at
the result of the Raglan by-election, necessi-
tated by the death of Internal Affairs
Minister Bollard, who had held the seat for
16 years. Two years ago Bollard polled
4470 votes and had a majority of 1613 over
all other candidates combined. At the by-
election the Reform vote slumped to 2025
an'd a Laborite won the seat with 2200
votes. Reform put up a weak candidate,
it is true, but the constituency is mostly
cocky and the increase in the Labor Vote is
regarded as an alarming portent.
Four months’ brooding over the Rural
Bank Bill has convinced the majority of
Hogan’s Vic. Labor Cabinet that it will be
wiser to make the institution they have in
mind an adjunct of the Savings Bank than a
separate aitair. Before the issue was settled
there was a reference to Caucus and the
Cabinet majority won. Now if the Savings
Bank’s rural department is entrusted with
the collection of soldier-settlers’ rents and
repayments something like a business system
may be evolved.
The River Murray conservation, irrigation,
canalisation and navigation scheme, to which
N.S.W., Victoria, S. Australia and the Com-
monwealth are partners, is now in a fairly-
advanced stage. The Auditor-General of S.
Australia says his State has put about 91
millions of loan money into it and its side-
shows, with something over for attached
railways. He further says :
Interest and rent due from soldiers is largely
unpaid. .. . The greater part of the interest due on
at count of soldier settlement was paid from loans.
Without taking into account further losses of capi-
tal and interest on soldier settlement, more than
7,000,000 will continue to be unproductive of any
return of interest for many years. As the State is
committed to further expenditure on locks the annual
burden must increase.
In effect, the grandiose scheme may turn out
a blessing to South Aus., but so far it has
been all burden.
A glaringly obvious piece of foolishness,
which the Commonwealth Treasurer should
repair but never does, concerns the Federal
graduated land-tax for “breaking up big
estates.” The silly law defines by price
only, not by price and area combined; yet
any Treasurer should know that it is impos-
sible to break up the great estate that Cul-
wulla Chambers or the new David Jones
structure stands on without breaking the
building, too. If Wyoming, in Macquarie-
street, Sydney, was cut up and consequently
fell down, the highway and the Gardens
beyond would be covered with dead doctors
and dentists. There are bloated land mono-
polies 20ft. across which come under the tax,
and all it does in a great city is to raise the
cost of living. Certainly Treasurer Page
reduced the rate a little, but in Sydney local
authority more than undid his work by a
tremendous increase in the valuation.
Arthur T. Treble gets £lB5O a year for
being N.S.W. Child Endowment Commis-
sioner. A pliable Governor allowed Lang to
sack the caucus-appointed Ministry and
choose another himself in order to briug
about Treble’s appointment. The other day
this gentleman was sued by a man described
as “John Mills, landscape gardener,” who
said that he worked for Treble at £1 per
week and “found.” On June 25 the Horti-
cultural and Garden Employees’ award came
into force, and Mills wanted £43-odd, being
the difference in pay and 21G hours’ overtime
money—2l6 hours in nine weeks. The
magistrate ruled him out as being in
“domestic service,” but the impression re-
mains that the Commissioner’s wage-sheet
won’t involve him in large contributions to
his own endowment fund.
The Vic. Auditor-General and Public Ser-
vice Commissioner, by the terms of their
appointments, are made independent of Gov-
ernments. They can be removed only by a
vote of both Houses. Yet £250 of the £l5OO
salary for each is provided by vote on the
Estimates, instead of by special appropria-
tion. Perhaps the present Government, like
its predecessors, realises that there is likely
to be less wrangling over an item on the
Estinn tes in the small hours of a closing
session than over a bill or bins.
“Carisbrook, Jun.” : The genuine prospec-
tor in Queensland thinks it about time the
fraud was kicked off the Mines Department
doorstep. The department, under the Act,
pays prospectors up to £2 2s. per week,
much as a store would grub-stake a man in
the olden days. But the department has no
hold over the men, and in many cases they
have drawn the maximum weekly allowance
and not even made a report. Two were
advanced £3OO for mining purposes. They
went nowhere near the alleged field, but
spent their time gathering sandalwood, for
which they obtained a good price. The
frauds argue: “Well, y’ see, we only get a
quid a week from tli’ Unemployed Insurance;
but they give us two quid if we go an’ camp
in the bush a bit.”
When a tornado wrecked portion of St.
Louis, a Yankee city of 800.000 population,
it was assumed that bad characters would
gather from* far and near bent upon loot. So
1000 Federal troops were sent to the spot,
in addition to the State National Guard.
There are about 100,000 Federal troops in
the U.S. proper, and the State of Missouri
has a National Guard 4500 strong. Aus-
tralian States have no National Guard,
though provision is made for such a thing
in the Constitution. The Federal force
under arms numbers about 1740. and there
are scruples about employing it unless a
State Government requests protection, and
for various reasons the State Government
might not. So bad characters, especially if
armed and organised, might loot for some
time with little interference.
“ALIVE! ALIA'E-OH!”
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Mr. Lang said that, all things considered, the
N.S.W. elections supplied one of the finest illustra-
tions of Labor vitality in the history of the move-
ment.”
We’ve run our coui'se and done our dash
with saddening rapidity,
As any crowd is bound to do that can’t
maintain solidity.
It irks me sore to have to leave the
Treasury’s locality,
But there’s a gleam of comfort in the
thought of our vitality.
I raised about our heads a storm of savage
animosity ;
The Treble job, detractors urged, outdid the
Kay atrocity.
They said we had no sense of constitutional
morality,
And that’s as may be, but you can’t dis-
parage our vitality.
All comrades of the caucus-room who showed
the least propensity
To cross my will were booted out with pas-
sionate intensity.
The traitors whooped they had m*e down.
How diff’rent the reality !
I may be bumped and bruised but still I
radiate vitality.
Where are the Loughlin mutineers? Extin-
guished of a surety,
Returned by their constituents to merited
obscurity.
While we, though hardly through the dis-
agreeable formality
Of giving up our jobs, have demonstrated
our vitality.
A hive, upturned, of angry bees invites no
affability ;
A piece of Stilton, over-ripe, too oft provokes
hostility.
There may be points in common, too, ’twixt
both and my sodality,
Though not exactly popular we’re humming
with vitality.

“P.M.”: A lot of the rot talked about the
lack of discipline immediately after the
Armistice (B. 29/9/’27) originated from a
few inevitable sprees that
took place in the English
depot camps. In our camp
the boys were hard to hold
when the news came through,
and the officers’ mess found
itself depending for break-
fast next morning on a half-
drunk cook and a partially
blithered waiter. The medi-
cal officer had just finished
his porridge when the latter,
coming up behind him, slid
a plateful of ham and eggs
into the bowl. “To make
the washin’ up lighter,” he
confided amiably. “There’s
only me an’ the babbler to
do it.” “Bring me a whisky,”
snapped the M.O. disgust-
edly. “Drop o’ snake-juice
for the quack, Bill,” was the
form in which the order
reached the kitchen. But
things were back to normal
again in a couple of days.
“P.M.”: The cocky who morosely invited
the Income-tax Commissioner to “come up
and take what’s left” (B. 29/9/’27) reminds
me of the Mallee husbandman’s letter to the
Vic. Land-tax Department: “You want to
know why I haven’t paid my
land-tax? Because there’s been
a drought, that’s why, and I’m
that broke if turkeys were four-
pence a dozen I couldn’t buy a
sparrow’s tail.”

red the other Friday night,

showcase at the end of a cul-de-
sac arcade crowded with the
usual shopping throng. When
the crowd saw the gentleman
burst the glass with a brick and
extract a tray valued at £lOOO
it immediately closed around
him. Some of it helped to hold
him till the police arrived, but
more of it helped to hold the
tray. A Melbourne crowd so
seldom exercises the virtue of
assisting the police that when
it does it expects to be re
warded. In this case it was
It went home with half the con-

“C.Q.”: The Vic. National
Gallery has received unexpected
manna in the shape of facsimile
reproductions of classic Spanish
works. The Hispanic Society
are the donors. The most inter-
esting item to Australians will
be the map of the world accord-
ing to the information and
imagination of Vicomtedi Maiollo
(1527). It shows how Spain at

gestive of the north of this con-
tinent look more promising than
thev really are. The early map-
makers frequently confused Bali,
to the north of Java, with
Japan, so Vicomtedi’s Australia
may o-sily have been Ceylon, or
even Singapore.
“Merris” : Ancient bells seem to have had
a special attraction for Diggers. At Blank-
liam, in the south of England, is one of the
oldest churches in the U.K. Bill and Jim
poked their noses into it one summer after-
noon, and the verger offered to show them
through. “That Roman arch,” he explained,
"is one of the finest in Europe. That window
is Early Tudor, and the font dates back to
William the Conqueror. The belfry was
added early in the fifteenth century.” Bill
and Jim climbed the narrow stairs, while
the verger, old and disinclined for such
exertion, remained below. Through the nar-
row slots in the massive brickwork of the
tower the pair looked down on the drowsy
village. “Have you ever rung a fifteenth-
century bell?” asked Bill at length. “No,”
said Jim. “Let’s!” Readers may finish the
paragraph for themselves, but perhaps it’s
worth mentioning that the bell for very
many years had been used exclusively for
bringing the village fire-engine into action.

“Nitric”: An essay competition was one
of the features of the recent Brisbane Music
Week. “Music! How the word fills the tor-
WELL CORKED DOWN.
“Is there nothing will make you speak to me of an evening, George?”
“Yes. But you’ve made me promise not to touch it.”
tured soul of hundreds!” one 15-year
cynic wrote. “The opera can be dated back
to the Elizabethan ear,” recorded another.
“Music is a great help to people who have
not the sense to do anything else” was
another proposition advanced. One lad de-
fined a rest in music as “an interval for
refreshments,” and a juvenile competitor in-
formed all whom it might concern that “he
had learnt two scales and five archipelagoes.”
One more extract: “Tosti was a famous oper-
atic star who was interred in Italy. He
had low chesty notes, but otherwise was a
man of good character.”

“Penfield”: What is the limit of the
taxi’s journeyings? Or hasn’t it got
one? A fortnight ago, when the country near
Blayney (N.S.W.) was having its first good
soaking for six months, I passed a leuow
well and truly bogged by the roadside. Near
Cootamundra, ploughing through the slush,
the driver of a Black-and-White was cursing
his bad luck. A while earlier a Melbourne
taxi had pulled into Temora ; and an Orange
man assures me that he can be run over by a
Sydney taxi almost any week in the year. But
that’s only a small matter of 180-odd miles
from the home garage, while the others meant
anything up to 350 miles on the outward run
alone. Does the ticker go all the time?

“Topee” : A marine-engineer friend recently
took me for a round motor trip. Coming
to the steam ferry, upon which there were
already a couple of cars, we found the master
and engineer just leaving to fetch tools to
effect an engine repair. My friend, whose
professional assistance had been rather
brusquely declined by the departing pair,
proceeded to examine the engine and, finding
nothing wrong with it, navigated the punt
across to the entire satisfaction of the other
passengers. As we were disembarking we
saw the crew running down to the dock, and
heard their curses as they jumped into a boat
to regain their pirated craft. Also we soav
the tools for which the punt had been held
up—two bottles of beer and a tin of Clever
Mary!

“Bad Australian”: Touching the line of
cairns marking the track of Hume and Hovell
from the Murray to Corio Bay (B. 6/10/’27).
I suggest the section of it between the King
and Broken rivers is pure guesswork, and
poor guesswork at that. The greater part of
the country between Moyhu on the King and
Swanpool on the Broken River consists of
rough, steep, heavily-timbered spurs covered
with a dense undergrowth of bracken, dog-
wood and scrub-wattle. If the explorers
really followed the route marked by the
cairns, accompanied by their stock, they per-
formed a feat that no bushman would will-
ingly undertake to-day. And why on earth
should the party have chosen such a route
when by keeping 10 or 15 miles to the north-
ward they might have gone through almost
level, fertile, well-grassed country from the
King to the Broken River, country visible
from almost any point on their reputed
track ?

“X.N.0.”: “Centurion” (B. 6/10/’27)
need not worry about Germany’s new
cruisers having nine 6in. guns ranging to
20,000 yards. The range won’r be of much
value owing to the extreme accuracy re-
quired to hit with any gun at 10 miles, and
the added difficulty of obtaining such accu-
racy when the gun platform is a mere
6000-ton cruiser responsive to the slightest
motion of the sea. The 1011 b. shell they will
fire is only one pound heavier than that used
by our old 6in. guns, and there are no great
poiuts about triple-gun mountings if there
is a proper fire-control system. The number
of men required to man them is slightly. less
than for a double mounting or for single
guns, but one enemy shell can wipe out
three guns' crews and perhaps three guns
instead of only two or one.

“Free Kick’’: It happened in the Cam-
bridge-road (Tas.), and the time was after
midnight. A party of footballers, homeward
bound, had awakened Mrs. Publichouse
from her beauty sleep, with- a boisterous
demand that she should come down and open
the door before they pushed it in. The lady
obligingly descended, opened the door and
landed the nearest boisterer a punch that
dropped him like a pithed bullock. This
Dempsey-like reception effectually quenched
the thirst of the other leather-chasers, and
they faded away in no time. There were
some subsequent police-court proceedings for
disorderly conduct, but the magistrate
debited the footballers with nothing worse
than noisiness and almost hinted that the
lady might have been a little premature with
her straight left.

“Sol M.”: Basil Riley, the London
Times pressman who vanished several weeks
ago in a Honan (China) city, is still miss-
ing, but reports are about. One is that a
German lady doctor has arrived in Shanghai
footsore, lacking visible means of support,
and slightly unbalanced because her husband
and children were killed by some brand of
Chow patriots. She says that Riley was
slain by the Christian General Feng or some
of his gang, in a casual hour, and that she
could locate the grave if she felt like going-
back to the spot. British and German con-
suls, having a low opinion of Chinese jus-
tice, are said to be on the trail, and. if Feng
doesn't trail them too closely they iray dis-
cover something. But the pursuit of an
irresponsible person with a big army, over
n “republic” more than half the size of
Australia, is a large job.
THE OPTIMIST,
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Discussing the agitation for an increased allow-
ance at Canberra on account of the cost of living, a
member from a distant State' declared, ‘lt is all rot.
Living here is costing me about half what it did in
Melbourne. I find that I can save a good deal
because there is so little on which to spend money.’ ”
—Annus.
A trifle slow? Well, possibly it is.
But surely none need h.c.l. be rueing
When he’s attending to the country’s biz
Where there are no facilities for blowing
His boodle in gay pleasure’s whirl and whiz
Or his good brass on dissipation doing?
A thou, a year may be a paltry income
In lots of places. Here I find it dinkuna.
Let whoso will resign himself to woe
Recalling Melbourne’s raptures and its
roses.
True, we’ve no radiant Flemington to show,
No beckoning Caulfield its delights dis-
closes.
But. dash it all! a fellow saves the dough
That otherwise might go to Isaac Moses.
And there’s the missus, too. Each week
I’m socking
The bit away she would have spent in
frocking.
No high-priced stadiums with whirling fists
Are here, no theatres or clubs expensive.
Such lack of life’s worth-whiles, the thought
persists,
Could hardly have been made more com-
prehensive.
Withal, collectors with subscription lists
Don’t keep you morn to night on the
defensive.
A cloistered life, maybe. But still in cloisters
At least you’re saved the cost of stout and
oysters.
STONY.
WIFE (all soul ): “Oh George, do you realise that it’s
almost a year since our honeymoon and that
glorious Christmas we spent on the sands. I
wonder how we’ll spend this one?”
HUSBAND (mostly uppers ): “On the rocks.”
No giddy Glaciarium; no Block;
No surfing damozel or equine trotter
(The ovine Is the only sort we stock) ;
No joyous jazz to make the blood run
hotter;
No Speedway with its roar and thrill and
shock:
Wo gay and festive Henley-on-the-L otter;
Nor any beer, for virtuous or vicious,
Except the saddeningly surreptitious.
No barmaid-brightened counter where a man
Might set ’em up, nor any bar for breast-
ing
Or polishing—this side of Queanbeyan!
Still, there are compensations, no contest-
ing.
’Twas hard to save in Melbourne —no one
can—-
But here there’s something over for invest-
ing.
The more your salary, as I apprehend it,
The fewer chances that you get to spend it.

T. THE R.


“Jobber” : I know a Digger who was
skittled in 1916 and will never stand
on his feet again. After eight years
in hospital he and his Digger nurse
got married, and applied to the War
Service Homes for a loan. The com-
mission advanced him the full amount,
and the Digger’s old boss put up the
crib, an extra good one. That was
three years ago, and the pair are as
happy as a lamb with two mothers.
For five hours every day the woman
attends to her man, for in many ways
lie is still terribly helpless. But in others
he can still do liis bit. He spends the
morning at leather work readily sale-
able. His garden is one of the sites of
the suburb, and most of the work is
done from the wheeled chair, with a
specially-made rake and hoe. A
brother, also a Digger, looks in every
two months, and puts in the week-end
doing the heavy work, but apart from
that the spine case is the gardener. A
cobber who lives near, and who hasn’t
much of his right leg remaining, blows
in to lend a hand with the lawn-
mowing. “Hoppy” puts what weight lie
has left behind the machine while the
wheeled-cliair operator pulls on a rope.
To hear them chaffing one another about
their respective disabilities makes one
wonder more than ever why any cold-
footer should ever have been born.
* * * *
“Cousin John”: Social distinctions
in a country town are often puzzling,
but old Dan, the barman at the Mug-
wump hotel, enlightened me a lot the
day of the football game between that
hamlet and Billygoat Flat. A pair of
silken hose flashed past us. “That’s
Lucy Maltlioid,” said Dan, without
enthusiasm. “Old man runs the milk-
round ; bustin’ ’er gizzard to get in
with the Cream Puffs, but she ain’t
got a hope while young Artie Thomas
from the Wheatslieaf’s cartin’ ’er.”
“The Cream Puffs?” I murmured
interrogatively. “The bong-tong, yer
know. The other mob’s the ‘ ’Ard
Buns.’ ” I expressed some curiosity
about the dividing-line, and Dan
became more explicit. “The doctor’s
lady,” he assured me, “is the queen o’
Mugwump. Mrs. Sixenate’s 'er orf-
sider, while Mrs. Quids from the bank
and the parson’s wife ’as the right of
private ongtry.” An affluent dame in
a tiger-skin coat waddled by. “ ’Ard
Bun,” grunted Dan. “Mrs. ’lggins
from the fruitshop—made a pot outer
the soda fountain.” Presently up came
Grantly, the school-teacher, a fellow
with stooping shoulders and a bulging
brow. “Used to be one of the helite,”
said Dan when he had left us, “but
when the Cream Puffs found out ’is
mother took in sewin’ they gasped with
’orror, and then ’e finished ’imself by
gettin’ engaged to Cissy Thomas from
the Wheatsheaf.” I asked if publicans’
daughters were outside the fold. “Too
right they are,” Dan answered,
“unless they take up church work.”
“M.G.S.” : It is to be hoped that the Fed-
eral Government will not accept “Arradni’s”
suggestion (B. 13/10/’27) to waste more of
its surplus by offering a prize for an Aus-
tralian national anthem. The pigeonholes
are crammed with previous syntlietised
efforts at patriotism in verse, and thoroughly
depressing things most of them are. A new
one, by C. J. Dennis, is now struggling for
recognition round about Melbourne. He
originally wrote it as a set of comic verses,
but recently put ice on his mirthful spirit
and rewrote it in serious vein. Composer
James set it to music, and it resembles the
Old Hundredth so closely that at a recent
concert the whole house rose because they
thought it was a hymn. I don’t think the
public will allow an anthem to be wished
on them. It will have to come spontaneously,
like the Marseillaise.
* * * *
“Mudros”: Whatever official historians of
the Gallipoli campaign decide to say about
the Landing, there is no doubt that units
got thoroughly mixed up there. To begin
■with, the Third Brigade, which formed the
covering party, were landed about a mile
north of the positions indicated in orders.
Companies and platoons, however, pushed
straight ahead, and when their advance was
stopped, they got out their entrenching tools
and scratched some sort of a line. Here
they hung on against numerous attacks, and
as the Turk sought our flanks the line was
extended by the fresh battalions landed. The
rugged nature of the country made com-
munication most difficult, messengers got
lost, and reinforcements sent to one part
of the line were only too likely to find them-
selves in another. On the third night my
company was relieved ; sorting them out in
the morning I found that I lad represen-
tatives of nearly every battalion in the
First Division, together with a subaltern and
half a dozen men from Maoriland.
* * * *
“F.S.H.” : Beware of very old wine! I
know six Diggers who have painful memories
of a case of aged champagne they unearthed
while excavating in an old ruin in France.
They drank the stuff like water, about a
bottle and a half apiece, and smacked their
lips. An hour later the whole six were on
their way to hospital. They all pulled
through, but only after suffering excruciating
agony.

“Machete”: Queensland, where a Judge
once decided, after seeing a demonstration by
an expert, that two-up was a game of skill,
still retains a flavor of its old time pastoral
simplicity. In the State Arbitration Court
the other day, representatives of employers
and employees came to agreement in a wage-
THE REPRIEVE.
“The Vic. Government’s Tote Bill does not contemplate the abolition of the bookmaker.”
VIC. PREMIER HOGAN: “We’re not going to kill it—you can keep on fattening it.”
fixing case save on one point, the question
of a shilling a day on one item. It looked
like a deadlock till a bright idea struck the
employers’ rep. “Let’s toss for it,” he sug-
gested. The other side assented, and, with
the presiding beak’s approval, the copper was
skied. The employers won, but' it is not
recorded which party “spun her up.” Not
the least edifying part of the affair was the
entire confidence of the gamblers in each
other’s integrity—a confidence which would
not be so marked in some places one could
mention.

“X.D.”: The Melbourne police are look-
ing at a remarkable piece of knavery. It
is a £5-note, correct to the smallest detail,
made from eight pieces torn from other
notes. So perfect is the combination that
a tradesman cheerfully handed over £4 19s.
for it to the purchaser of a shilling’s worth
of chocolate.

“Unity”: The interference with listening-
in isn’t always due to power-houses or mys-
terious natural causes (B. 13/10/’27>. At
Manly the other afternoon I thought I’d like
to hear some racing results and turned on
the loud speaker. The proceedings went off
something like this. “First, Murillo,” re-
marked the announcer. “Now thank we all
our God,” responded an invisible choir located
somewhere at Clifton Gardens. We missed
the other two placed horses in the continua-
tion of the burst of thanks. At the repe-
tition of the names we got as far as “Lim-
erick” for second place, when the choir cut
in again, reminding us that it was like this
in the beginning. The announcement that
Horton Gag had filled third place was fol-
lowed by a soulful and reverent “Amen.” It
was merely a religious fraternity having a
little practice on a holiday afternoon, but
their station has the power to stifle one of
the big wireless concerns and maul the other
badly.

“F.A.L.”: They w 7 ere three small girls,
ages from 8 to 10. employed in getting an eye-
ful of the Shakspeare memorial near the
entrance to the Sydney Botanical Gardens. It
was clear that Romeo and Juliet interested
them most, but even that triumph of the
sculptor’s art found them critical. “Gosh!”
said one, “look at the way lie’s kissing the
girl. Gee, I saw a better kiss than that at
the pictures last night!”

“The Spook”: This Number Thirteen
superstition gets a tremendous lot of con-
sideration nowadays. I live in a building
that holds 16 flats. The numbers run from
1 to 12 and from 14 to 17. Steamship
companies are equally ready to humor their
passengers; on the newest liners there is
no number 13 cabin, and no seat 13 in the
dining saloon. But people must be deter-
minedly obtuse not to see that No. 14 is
really poor old 13 in disguise. 'l'Vh'hmi

Hamer : An oblique s -

Certainly it needs them badly, but after 132
years of heavy traffic the wonder is that it
should be anything better than a dust track,

“Centurion”: Cabled that the British War
Office has taken over control of Aden, that
peninsula of hot rock which guards the
entrance to the Red Sea. Since Britain
acquired it. a hundred years or so ago, it
has been run by the indian Government,
both in the days of John Company and
later, when Britain officially took over the
Raj. ’ Although it was a port of call for a
good many Eastern and Australian steamers,
a period of duty on “The Rock” was more
dreaded by the' Regulars than a taste of
any other station in the Empire. Australians
wlio had a glimpse of the dreary and arid
hole when an occasional transport dropped
in during the war will remember the hope-
less atmosphere of the place, which was
then cut off even from its uninviting back
country by hostile Arabs, who put a stopper
on the desert shooting which is the only
relaxation of the place. Now that oil fuel-
ling has largely cut out the necessity for
coaling there, shipping is dwindling, and
Aden promises to be better equipped than
ever as a place of punishment for slack or
otherwise naughty regiments.

“Uramao” : The desire to have a re-survey
of Maoriland’s coastline received a severe
jolt in Parliament the other day when the
figures furnished by the Admiralty authori-
ties were disclosed. The estimated cost is
£1,000,000 —£50,000 a year for 20 years.
It w 7 ould be nothing, of course, to the British
Empire, but for a population of a million
and a quarter it has a disturbing sound.
Some of the coastline has not been surveyed
since the 'fifties, but from henceforth the
matter is likely to be kept steadily out of
view.

“Simon” : Tuberculosis often does its work
in leisurely fashion. A man has just died in
the Waterfall (N.S.W.) Sanatorium after
being an inmate for 22 years. And the com-
plaint had a strong grip on him when he
entered.
“Ex-Dig.”: Divorce Courts may
have a fresh rush of work now that
the R.S.L. has established a precedent
by getting Repat. to restore a war
widow’s pension after she had secured
a dissolution of the marriage whereby
she forfeited it. The rule is that any
female dependant of a deceased soldier
who re-marries has her pension con-
tinued for two years, after which it
ceases, pensions for any children, of
course, being continued. Had it been
ruled that such pensions should cease
abruptly on re-marriage there might
have been fewer of these unions ending
in desertion, for it is notorious that a
certain type of man was only too ready
to marry a war-widow to get the
handling of her Repat. money, little
though it might be, and to leave her
when payments ceased. In the case
under notice the woman was the
mother of a dead soldier who had sup-
ported her and had made her an allot-
ment when he enlisted ; and although
she was elderly and her pension only
£2 7s. per fortnight, the latter was
apparently a sufficient bait for some
undesirable suitor.

“Hanno”: Many men have broken
out of gaol, but there are very few
instances on record of a man breaking
into a prison. One occurred in Mel-
bourne some years ago. The operator
was a man who had just served a sen-
tence for the theft of some jewellery,
only a portion of which had been re-
covered. The rest, consisting of some
£3OO-wortli of diamonds, he had man-
aged to secrete and take inside with
him, subsequently burying them in a
metal matchbox under a slab in the
exercise yard. Released sooner than
he expected, he was unable to retrieve
his plant. During the weeks that fol-
lowed he tried in vain to gain admit-
tance to the old Melbourne Gaol, and
at last climbed one night to the roof
of the Workingman’s College next
door, and swai’med across to the gaol
wall by an electric cable. He was close
to his objective when a warder on the
opposite wall spotted him, but he man-
aged to make his escape. The incident
was for long a mystery to the gaol
authorities, and it was not until
months later that the explanation was
supplied by another prisoner. But
when the yard was examined there was
no sign of the hidden diamonds. EitUer
the man who had planted them made a
second and more successful visit, or,
wliat is more likely, someone else
reaped where he had sowed.

“The Eistening-Insect”: Governor
Somers of Victoria put wireless to a
new use when, sitting comfortably in
an easy chair at his Melbourne resi-
dence, lie spoke into a microphone. The
winged words were picked up by 3LO
and relayed to Braybrook, which broad-
cast them; Benalla, gathering them
out of the ether, amplified them all
over the local showground, and thus its
jubilee show was duly opened. The
idea has attractive possibilities. Bored
gubernatorial parties need no longer
sit and stifle yawns at highbrow con-
certs. A few radio-ed remarks w/uld
satisfy the management and more than
satisfy the audience, his Ex. could go
on with his game of bridge, and at the
end of the entertainment the house
could stand while the loud-speaker
emitted the sound of the vice-regal feet
tramping over a floor.
“Pip Tok” : At the recent Returned Sol-
diers’ Congress in Perth it was resolved that
a certificate of merit be presented to a Perth
citizen as a recognition of the many services
j ie ] ias rendered to Diggers. The recipient of
the tribute is the secretary of several public
bodies, and the proposer of the motion, in
recounting the services rendered, couldn’t re-
frain from mentioning that ’even in his

Nakhoda”: Cohuna (Yic.) has turned up
another bit of evidence that Australia was
the stamping-ground of a very prehistoric
race. The new link is a skull, found by a
farmer digging in a bunny-warren in the
Kow swamp, which headpiece closely re-
sembles the previous Cohuna exhibit, thus
tending to prove that the now famous relic
is not a modern abo.’s block freakishly re-
sembling the ape-man’s. According to Prof,
Colin Mackenzie, director of the National
Museum of Australian Zoology, the skull
belongs to the prehistoric Cohuna race and
antedates all human remains, including the
Piltdown. Talgai and Rhodesian bones. Com-
pared with the Cohuna man, homo Neander-
thaliensis is presumably no more than an
upstart.
THE TALLY CLERK.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I’m leaving the job to-morrow, though it’s
well enough hi its way.
The boss is a decent sort of chap, and there’s
nothing wrong with the pay,
But it’s getting along to Christmas, and I
guess they’ll be carting wheat,
And I can’t stick it out any longer in a shop
in Bundle-street!
I said good-bye to the boys last night. I’m
leaving my girl in town,
For it’s getting along to harvest, and the
wheat’ll be coming down;
And I’m sick for the breath of the morning
and the hot sun slanting through
The stretch of pines where the white road
goes crawling to Wallaroo!
I’m sick for the sight of the sidings, with
the great brown bags piled high,
For the jolt and jar of the couplings as the
long, linked trucks go by,
For the screech of the blamed old whistle,
ripping the night in two
Where the wheat-trains travel the crossings,
clack-clacking to Wallaroo!
I’ll wangle a job in the wheat-yards, and
tally ’em into the stack—
The farmer drops his bag on your scales,
and the lorries hoot and back
Grinding the yards to powder. Lord!
even the dust is sweet
To a chap like me that’s homesick for
the sight of the bags of wheat!
Where the big ships lie together I shall
hear the winches sing
As they lift the big bags over and see
’em “make” a sling.
Yes, I’m leaving here to-morrow. I’m
fed right up with town,
For a chap can’t help remembering
when the wheat is coming down!

“So she ought to. She pays 35s. a pair for her stockings!”
“Well, they’re cheap. I can see a couple of quids’ worth!”
“Jobber”: Have read several pars, about
Diggers’ capacity for letter-writing. Can
any other A.I.F. man tell of a pal who
neither wrote nor received a single letter
during his whole term of service? I had a
cobber, a fairly well educated man, too,
to whom mails meant nothing. When letters
were being distributed, he would sometimes
jocularly say that if only an old lubra on
the Diamantina would send a notched stick
it would be better than nothing; actually
it never seemed to worry him a scrap.
“Pip Tok”: One of the R.A.N.’s unique
records is that an Australian cruiser, the old
Challenger, helped to fire the first salute ever
produced by British guns in an American
port on Independence Day. This was on July
4, 1911, when the Challenger, in company
SWEET REVENGE.

with the Kent, was lying in Honolulu Har-
bor. Strangely enough, before that date no
British warship had ever struck an American
port on or about the “Glorious Fourth.”

“Blanc”: After 15 years in Australia,
Jean Sauve re-
turned to France
in 1916 with the
4th Batt., A.1.F.,
and found himself
in brisk demand
among all ranks as
a linguist. Claim-
ing to be as good
an Aussie as any
Digger, Jean re-
turned one night
with a souvenired
pair of roosters,
and was called by
the Colonel the
njext morning to
interpret for a very
indignant French-
man demanding 40
francs for the miss-
ing poultry. “What
is he talking about,
Jean?” asked the
C.O. “He say zat
some troops ’ere
last month steal
two roosters.
“Tell him that’s
nothing to do with
us. We only came
last week.” “Your
40 francs will be
paid to you by the
Colonel who comes
here to - morrow.”
Jean translated,
and the owner of
the birds gestured
his satisfaction.
Jean often told the
story, invariably
concluding with:
”Ze Colonel ’appy,
ze old Froggy
appy, I ’appy. But
I not know what
’appen ze nex’ day
when ze new bat-
talion take over
from ze 4th.”
“Carisbrook, .Tun.” : Admittedly the surest
safeguard against pearl thieving on the
Westralian coast is to employ men of dif-
ferent nationalities, Jap, Malay or Koepan-
ger, on the one lugger (B. 29/9/’27) ; the
only drawback is that it has caused nearly all
the racial riots Broome has been cursed with.
The big row of 1914, when over a dozen
Asiatics were killed and the pearl fleet laid
up because so many hands were in hospital,
started through a Koepanger alleging that a
Jap had stolen a pearl on one of the luggers.
The whole crew were soon into holts, and
half an hour later the waterfront was a
mass of fighting Koepangers and Japs, with
the Malays joyfully lending a hand against
the latter whenever a chance offered. But
the Japs were more scientific fighters, and In
the end they had most of their opponents
disabled or seeking cover in the bush. The
Asiatics kept possession of Broome for over
a week on that occasion, and the town was
only “recaptured” at dead of night, when
practically the whole of the white popula-
tion, armed with business-looking rifles and
revolvers, disarmed and gaoled the Asiatics.
* :|: * *
“Montague Tigg”: A curious development
of modern social life is the tendency to slob-
ber over the wrongdoer. Take the case of
Horatio Bottomley, recently released in Eng-
land after a stiff term of penal servitude for
a whole series of cruel and callous swindles.
Thousands are flocking to his lectures on
the “cruel wrong” done to him, and punctu-
ating his crocodile sobs with cheers. His
nefarious activities ruined thousands of small
investors, many of them women. These have
gone, Heaven knows where, beggared and
broken. The man who swindled them is
living softly on the wealth saved from his
crash, and has the sympathy of the maudlin
morons who give no thought at all to the
thousands he consigned to hopeless poverty.
Hr. :!-. « *
“ vVindsor”: Melbourne’s postal officials
goggled over a queer address the other day.
Covering the whole of the face of the enve-
lope, and compensating in exhaustiveness for
what it lacked in punctuation, the direction
ran :
To the man from Warburton with seven children
who was inquiring at Coburg for house he is living
at Northcote near swampy land will postman try to
find him he was burnt out during the fire he is a
woodcutter and has only one eye.
By latest advices the P.M.G. has run down
the quarry.
* * H: *
“Ivayeff”: Papuans may be beginning to
need dental attention, but the Polynesian,
unless he happens to be a betel-nut cliewer,
is as sure to be equipped with a perfect
set of teeth as he is to have black hair.
If not, you can bet he is very old indeed,
or has been an indentured laborer and de-
voured too much “kai-kai belong white
master.” To strip the husk from a cocoa-
nut, the white man requires a pointed stick
or an iron bar, plus the knack and a fair
amount of energy. Any Polynesian can strip
a nut to the shell by tearing away the
covering with his teeth. The only attention
most of the tribes give to their ivories is to
rub them occasionally with a piece of fuzzed-
up pandanus.
“P.M.”: To what age do old locos, last
on the railways? I remember two very old
engines, J 4 and .16, which ran on the Broad-
meadows-Essendon line in 1911 and were
said to be nearly 60 years old. The Koon-
drook tramway has an engine 43 years old
which it bought from the Vic. railways a
couple of years ago, and the driver reckons
that there are years of life ahead of it yet.
“The Listening-Insect”: The other morn-
ing London broadcast a programme for Aus-
tralia. Holland picked it up and relayed
it to Moonee Ponds (Vic.), whence 3LO dis-
seminated it again. On its travels between
London and the Netherlands the programme
got mixed up with a
storm, and the music
and the tempest were
sent along together. It
is the first time, as far
as meteorological re-
cords go, that a Euro-
pean disturbance has
reached Moonee
Ponds.

“C he v r oford":
“G oldilocks” (B.
6/10/’27) says the car
attendant grew out of
the motorist's eager-
ness to pay a fee for
security. In my ex-
perience the vast bulk
of car attendants are
useless parasites who
provide no security
worth a hang. The
owner pays his shil-
ling and gets an alleged
receipt, but when he
comes to claim his
chariot the seedy per-
son who is supposed
to be in charge of it
is struggling with a
mob of other owners
40 cars off. and so he
gets away with his
own property, precisely
as a thief might. Most of Melbourne’s park-
ing areas have no legal charge, but if the
motorist doesn’t come to light with his bob
he is likely to find that after a block or two
that he is driving on his rims.
:!•• * * *
“Penacre”: Kimberley (W.A.) aborigi-
nals, when they have not been civilised by
missions or other contact with white people,
can show the most perfect and cleanest teeth
in Australia, even in the case of aged bucks.
Until the abo. starts using tobacco and alco-
hol liis- teeth are perfect, the gritty ashes
adhering to primitively cooked meat doubt-
less helping to keep the molars white and the
gums firm. Conversely, the civilised natives
have the worst-kept teeth I have ever seen.
* * * *
“Paul” : The ancient breed of lamplighters
is not quite extinct. The last of the tribe
in Sydney may be seen going his rounds in
the University Park every night. Critical
undergrads, attribute him to the Senate’s con-
servatism, but his survival is more likely the
result of lack of cash. Gas is still an essen-
tial at the Uni.; stained-glass windows make
the Great Hall, where examinations are held,
a gloomy place even in the daytime.
* * * *
“C.Q.”: The shoplifter who appears in
court is invariably a tearful lady with a
stout drinking husband and a large starving
family, who succumbed suddenly to tempta-
tion. But ask the sliopowners their opinion !
Recently a big Melbourne rag firm noticed
that the thieves had a special liking for a
particular line of goods, so a table was loaded
with them and all the sleuths in the shop
were set to watch the bait. Despite their
vigilance the stuff was found to be gradually
vanishing. The people who can perform such
feats of prestidigitation must have served a
long apprenticeship to Uncle Fagin.
=l= S’- * *
“Manuka” : Travelling recently on the rail-
way from Zeehan (Tas.) to Regatta Point we
noticed the train stop at a place where there
was no sign of a station building or siding
of any sort. The driver climbed casually
down from the engine and just as casually
removed a ’possum trom a snare by the line.
The train then resumed its journey to the
accompaniment of a round of cheers from the
passengers.
* * * *
“Alwyn”: If only Governor Phillip had
been allowed his way the city of Sydney
would never have needed remodelling. The
Sydney that Phillip projected was drawn on
rectangular lines, and the generous width of
the streets would have delighted the modern
town-planner. But his dream was never to
be realised; even his insistence on “free
air” and one house to an allotment went by
the hoard as early as 1833. In that year the
authorities permitted the Grose Farm Estate,
Darlington, to be subdivided into lots having
merely an average frontage of 30ft. with 60ft.
depth, a circumstance primarily responsible
for the scandal of over 15,000 people being
housed on the 54 acres at present comprising
that congested city area. Phillip’s coadjutor
in designing Sydney as it should have been
was Surveyor-General Augustus Alt, an ex-
Baron of the German Duchy of Hesse-Cassel,
who was also Australia’s first J.P.
The early-day Governor rests in a little
Somersetshire churchyard ; the pioneer magis-
trate lies in St. John’s Cemetery, Parra-
matta.

There is evidence of lively turnover there.
The £328,480 netted for the year was 16
p.c. on paid capital, or 15.9 p.c. on average
ord. capital after the pref. requirements
(£49,958) had been met. A very encourag-
ing result considering the new 11-storeyed
warehouse in Lonsdale-street was only out
of the contractors’ hands half-way through
the term. The associated cos., the knitting
and woollen mills, had a busy year, which
means that there was a nice return from the
manufacturing end of the business. Share-
holders were liberally treated; the 174 p.c.
handed out called for as much as 91.6 p.c.
of the year’s net earnings, and that so large
a proportion is distributed may be taken as
an indication of the board’s confidence in
the future. All the same, visible reserves are
too small compared with the big capital, and
no opportunity to strengthen them should be
neglected. The rapid growth in Melbourne
city property values has possibly created
some inner reserves in freeholds, including
recent purchases; but with a paid capital
of over £2,000,000, the support needs to be
very substantial.
During the year 345,000 £1 ords. were
issued at a premium of ss. each. The
premiums added £86,250 to reserves, and the
balance of the cash made paid capital
£2,041,839 in 1,380,000 ords., 569,250 9 p.c.
cum. prefs. and 123,700 staff partnership
shares, these last paid to £92,589. The new
money was all absorbed in general expansion
of the business. This comparison of balance-
sheet figures shows the development during
the year:—
1926 1927.
Paid capital £1,676,978 £2,041,839

Stocks 962,486 1,104,084
Debtors 216,464 255,615
Cash, etc 8,094 10,256
Although building activities added £43,455
to mortgages, £237,994 was clipped off the
rest of the debt; thus the surplus of liquids
and semi-liquids (stocks, book debts, cash,
etc.) over outside liabilities was £445,029
compared with £67,579 a year earlier.
Stocks (£1,104,084, up £141,598) are heavy,
but they are in at a low figure compared
with their actual value, the chairman says,
and a great deal depends upon that. Equip-
ment has been severely written down.
It is only 16 years back that Sidney
Myer moved his business into Bourke-street,
and the progress since has been extraor-
dinary. Woollen mills were bought at Bal-
larat in 1918. Two years later the public
became interested when Myer’s (Australia),
Ltd., a holding co., was formed and 150,000
prefs. issued. Then the business of Robert-
son and Moffatt Pty., Ltd., was swallowed,
and at March 31, 1923, paid capital was
£1,135,961. The present co. emerged from
the reconstruction of two and a half years
ago. Since then Stephens and Sons Pty.
has been taken over, the Lonsdale-street
warehouse built, and the public has become
interested in the ords. Latest developments
are a decision to extend the warehouse and
the contemplated purchase of other pro-
perty, but nothing has been said as to liow
the board proposes to finance the additions.
The market, which is impressed by
the co.’s extraordinary success and its
fine earnings, backs the management and
pays 41s. for the ords., which have
a net tangible backing of 20s. Id.
each. At the former figure the return
is 84 p.c. as long as the 174 p.c. distribu-
tion continues. The goodwill placed on the
business by market is thus £1,443,250.
The prefs. arc well protected. The cover
amounts to 725. each in net tangibles, and
last year’s net profit was approximately 64
times their annual div. requirements. They
are priced at 265., thus returning the investor
a shade under 7 p.c.

One factor contributing to the big spring
(104 p.c.) in last year’s net profits was the
absence of any serious industrial trouble in
inter-State shipping; and that means a lot.
Another was that the new freighter Mernoo,
3900 tons deadweight, came into commission
in January. She arrived from England under
charter, but the co. is fortunate if it netted
a couple of thousand pounds on that score.
Also the Keera, bought to replace the Mait-
land, commenced work in the Port Phillip
towage trade half-way through the term.
Against all that there was a drop of 2s.
per ton in the Sydney-Melbourne freight-
rates between other inter-State ports were
unchanged—and bunker coal cost a few
pence more. The board’s modest claim is a
net profit of £35,741, just a few pounds more
than was necessary to pay the 10 p.c. div.
But that disregarded certain unexplained
additions to reserves—£3496 to the insurance
fund, making it £68,273, and £24,147 to the
provision for depreciation, contingencies, etc.,
making that £290,657. Whether the whole
of the latter figure is true profit the “Wild
Cat” cannot say definitely. But it is 60.7
p.c. of the book value of the fleet and a trifle
of plant (together £478,962), which is said to
be in partly at cost and partly at valuation.
Of the half-dozen freighters, only one is over
six years old, and the Dimboola, in the
passenger trade, was built in 1912. All of
which suggests that from time to time the
depreciation allowance has been more than
it need have been. As for the insurance
fund, it was dipped into last in 1918, when
£20,000 was extracted to meet part of the
capital bonus (£85,000) handed out in that
year. Nevertheless, though all this smells
like hidden money, of recent years the co.
cannot have reaped the rich harvests of the
post-war boom. For the five years to 1922
net profits totalled £395,952 and divs. called
for only 42.2 p.c. of it: in the last five years
the net profits, as tin; “Wild Cat” computes
them, were £213,825, and 77.9 p.c. of it was
handed to shareholders. Nevertheless, the
position is very comfortable. Reserves are
£14,173 in excess of paid capital. That is to
say, shareholders’ funds (£746,173) have to
earn only 4.7 p.c. in order to pay 10 p.c.
to the ords. after satisfying the prefs. Tak-
ing another view of the position, last year’s
net profit, after deducting pref. requirements
(£1560), was 18.1 p.c. on the ordinary
capital, compared with 8.6, 10.3, 13.1, 10.1
and 17.4 p.c. back to 1922.
Balance-sheet figures have lately moved
this way:—
1921. 1925. 1926. 1927.
Paid capital. . £366,000 £366,000 £366,000 £366,000

I n v e s tments,
cash.. .. 365,621 167,949 232,800 205,714
Besides reflecting the additions to the fleet,
the figures suggest that trade was brisker.
The financial position is, of course, very
comfortable. Including shares in other cos.
(£42,567), the more or less liquid surplus
was £233,276, compared with £252,854 a
year earlier. The effect of the formation of
the subsidiary, the Hobson’s Bay Dock and
Engineering Co. Pty., Ltd., is seen in a
comparison of the steamer and investments
and cash figures in 1926 with the corre-
sponding items for the previous year. What
the pup brought in last year has not been
disclosed; the engineering trade was slack
in the first half, but conditions then bright-
ened. However, the parent gets a rake off
as managing agent, and that helps.
The ords. have a net tangible backing of
395. 4d., assuming that the steamships are
worth cost. If, however, we assume that
they have depreciated 334 p.c. —con-
sidering their youth, that seems liberal—then
the net tangible backing for ords. is 31s. 6d.
They are priced at 30s. 6d. on the market.
At that figure the return to the investor is
64 p.c. on a 10 p.c. div. basis. The very
well protected profs.—there are only 26,000
of them, carrying a cumulative 6 p.c.—
seldom appear on ’Change.

West Australian Newspapers, Ltd. —
This co. took over the West Australian
and Western Mail from the Ilackett estate
as from July 1 last year; but as the co. was
not incorporated until September 27. under
the Westralian law the prolit made between
those dates is not available for distribution.
After providing for taxes due the prolit for
that period was £24,753; and this has been
used to write down goodwill—it now stands
at £298,931. The share capital is £350,000
in ordinaries and £lOO,OOO in 8 p.c. prefs.;
and there is £150,000 of 6£ p.c. debenture
stock. The profit for the nine months was
£81,331 less taxation, for which £11,500 is
put by; assuming that that is the full
amount of taxes payable, the profit for the
year was thus £94,584. After providing 8
p.c. for the prefs. there would be left
equal to 24$ p.c. on the ordinary
capital. Actually 8 p.c. was paid on the
prefs. for nine months and 2s. per share on
the ordinaries. The balance goes towards
reducing the intangibles (goodwill and pre-

Government stock, cash and shares, £75,976;
stock, £45,055;. and book debts, £34,442.
Liabilities, apart from debenture debt, total
£12.827. Thus the net tangible assets are
£168,747. It doesn’t look much to repre-
sent £450,000 of capital: but the profit is
the alluring feature. The earnings are very
greatly helped by charging 2d. for the West
Australian ; whether that could be main-
tained if competition came along is another
matter. Moreover, either plant has been
written down very severely or the co. is
pulling through on very little ; and it looks
as though some of the liquid assets will have
to go into the machine-room before long.

General expansion of the business assisted
by tlie sale of expropriated enemy properties
in the Mandated Territory sent last year’s
net profit up £6539, and the board could
have written a bigger figure if it had wanted
to. The co. finances planters and traders in
Island produce, and the success that has
attended the efforts of a vigorous and care-
ful management is reflected in the steady
growth of the figures in the table. Turn-
over has moved so rapidly that £110,186 of
new capital has had to be got in since 1923.
As the new money was put at work it exhi-
bited remarkable vigor. Gross profits have
climbed from £19,720 in 1923 to £41,627
at June 30, and last year’s net profit was
17.1 p.c. on average canital compared with
18.2, 14.8, 13.9 and 15.2 p.c. back to 1923.
Over the same period a steady 8 p.c. to
shareholders called for less than half the
net earnings ; thus visible reserves equal to
26.6 p.c. of paid capital have accumulated.
And further provision for the future is not
likely to be neglected while the Carpenters
remain in control. Last year the board pro-
vided for depreciation, bad and doubtful
debts, etc., before the final figures were
written into the sheet, and no doubt the
provisions were liberal. For instance, the
book value of shipping property contracted
£17,443, although there were no sales or
losses during the year. And even then £5102
of the visible earnings was ear-marked for
depreciation and sundries.
Here is a view of the growing strength
in balance-sheet figures :
1923. 1926. 1927.

Book debts .. .. 38,764 111,899 105,751
Cash 2,901 2,249 51,484
During the year £ L 7,350 was added to the
debt, and most of the £43,116 of new capital
that canve in apparently went out on mort-
gage. Including the latter the more or less
liquid surplus (£247,433) sprang £75,911.
Net tangibles work out at 255. 4d. per
share. The market adds a little for pros-
pects and pays 2Ss. At that figure the re-
turn to the investor is a shade better than
5J p.c. on an 8 p.c. div. basis. The div.. by
the way, is tax free in the hands of share-
holders, which somewhat compensates for
the lowness of the return.

The profit figures are growing, but margins
are narrowing and earning power has not
improved over the last three years. After
attending to the prefs. last year’s net profit
was only 8.1 p.c. on the average ord. capital
compared with 8.6 p.c. and 8.7 p.c. for the
two preceding terms. The city turnover
improved, but the mail-order business fell off,
chiefly no doubt owing to drought. One
serious difficulty has been to make the new
capital earn at the same rate as the old.
In 1926 £12,975 was got in, and an issue of
39,990 new £1 ords. last year made paid
capital £319,404 in 50,000 7 p.c. cum. prefs.
and 271,615 ords.; there was £2211 owing
under special terms. The policy has beeu
one of expansion. The businesses of the
Civil Service Stores, including the freehold,
and of Margaret Halstein were bought in
1926, and last year Chapman’s, Ltd., a
neighboring drapery concern, was absorbed-
terms not disclosed. Also a subway con-
necting the co.’s Adelaide and Queen
streets premises has been built and
alterations have been made to the buildings.
So far profits have not benefited greatly
from these additions, but future earnings
are expected to reap rewards. And they will
want to improve a good deal, too, before the
8 p.c. div. begins to look safe. Also reserves
(£24,023) wear an attenuated look in rela-
tion to paid capital. There is some hidden
strength in freeholds, but that cannot always
be tapped when it is most wanted.
Balance-sheet figures have moved in this
way:—
1925. 1926. 1927
Capital £269,200 £282,175 £319"404
Loans and overdraft . . 50,613 77,031 62,925

Debtors 59,981 65,128 64,954
Cash, etc. . . . . 484 528 5,098
To meet outside liabilities totalling £120,455
there was £246,865 in stocks, book debts,
cash, etc. Thus the improvement in the
liquid surplus (£126,410) amounted to
£16,923. In addition shares in other cos.
stood in the books at £21,296 —the co. holds
a controlling interest in Stupart’s, Ltd.,
Maryborough. Stocks (£176,263) are heavy
and nothing is said about their valuation;
much depends upon it. After striking off
£3073 for depreciation the year's net in-
crease in fixed assets was £23,220. Only
44.6 p.c. of the capital is locked up under
that head, but the recent heavy growth in
rates and taxes has put a big load on the
circulating assets. However, turnover has
improved since the close of the accounts, and
tin 1 board buys on a cash basis, both import-
ant factors in profit margins.
On the market, sellers were recently ask-
ing 225. for the ords. The return to the
investor at that figure is 7.2 p.c. as long as
the 8 p.c. div. continues. The security is
21s. 7d. in net tangibles. The prefs. seldom
appear on the market. Their cover in net
tangibles is £6 17s. 4d. per share, and last
year's net profit was seven times their
annual div. requirements.

A couple of years ago this business began to
look sick; margins were reduced by keen
competition—including the competition of the
dog-kennel kiosks that have been placed in
scores of cheap recesses —while the co.’s
own exes, kept on climbing. To overcome
the difficulty new departments were intro-
duced at the co.’s Haymarket (Sydney)
headquarters. Wireless, mercery and ,a caff
w’ere added to the other lines, and the man-
agement cast an eye over the organisation
generally; between one thing and another
the result was a spring of £6467 in last
year’s profit. The next comparison shows
how earnings and exes, have behaved since
pre-war days :—-

although moving in the right direction, is
still heavy. Except for 8 p.c. handed out

1922. But capital has never had much sup-
port by way of surplus assets that could be
touched with a stick or lit with a match.
Last year, however, the div. called for only
75 p.c. of the net earnings after striking oif
£3951 for depreciation, and the balance
(£5492) made the total savings from earn-
ings for the past five years £11,759. Still,
that made reserves only £18,479 in excess of

creditors (now £88,858) supplied the bal-

“investments” (£21,720) ; the nature of these
should be disclosed. Apart from that item,
but including stocks, the more or less liquid
surplus was £14,069 compared with £33,399
in 1926. Stocks are heavy and hetero-
geneous, and much depends upon their
valuation.
There is no reason to doubt that the busi-

general conditions of trade become no worse.
But the times are uncertain, and he would

Professor B. W. Steele, a member of the
Queensland advisory Oil Board, is the apostle
of good tidings regarding oil in the Roma
region. In making fraction tests of the oil
recovered lie has found the Cn Hn2+2
chain —the paraffins—practically complete,
from the light gases to the heavy lubricants.
1-Ie states that the stoppage of the former
escape of oil is due to condensation before
it gets to the surface, and that it is dropping
back into the bore. In proof of this, driller
Evans has secured extra supplies of petrol
by bailing the top of the well. He has
no doubt that considerable supplies of petro-
leum exist somewhere in the Maranoa
basin. Operations are at a standstill except
for consolidating the borehole. The direc-
tors of the R.O.C. will probably decide this
week what programme is to be followed after
considering the recommendations of the Oil
Board. L. C. Ball is supervising pit sinking
in the vicinity of the bore to determine the
stratigraphical structure. In the event of
a new bore being decided on. this data will
largely determine the site. The Oil Board
is definitely against extracting petrol from
the gas until possibilities of flowing oil
being found in the vicinity are exhausted.

The Australian Radium Corn., hearing
that the Commonwealth Government thinks
of spending £lOO,OOO in radium, establishing a
sort of bank on which hospitals, etc., may
draw, has appealed to Ministers to give it
the order. The management says the stuff
can be produced in Australia and there is no
necessity to buy from abroad. The co.’s
mine is at Mount Painter, in the north of
South Australia; the ore is sent for treat-
ment to Dry Creek, four miles from Adelaide,
and thus far 50 milligrammes of the refined
goods have been recovered and sold. If the
Government places the contract abroad, it
will probably be with the Radium Beige,
whose mines, in the Belgian Congo, are
worked by cheap native labor. When Ernest
Rutherford, the great authority on radium,
was in Melbourne, he declared that the
sample of S. Australian radium ores shown
to him were the richest he had ever seen.

There is no telling what will happen at
the two ends of the Broken Hill lode—or,
rather, at the two ends of the lode as it is
now worked. Of course it leaves off some-
where ; but does it leave off in two big bulges,
in the old Block 5 (Zinc Corp.) and the
North, or is it more likely to trail off into
fingers of ore? For miles both north and
south of the big lode there are supposedly
isolated ore bodies —the Pinnacles and
Thackaringa to the south and Round Hill
to the north; and geophysical exploration
may disclose a connection between the main
lode and those bodies. The chief thing in
doubt is: Does the lode run on, or is it split
up? The B. H. Southern Lode Continuation
is testing some of the flat ground beyond the
Zinc Corp.’s mine, and at 600 ft. they have
one 2ft. body and another of unproved size.
A 2ft. body is no good, even though it is
25 p.c. lead ; so the co. is hoping for better
things at greater depth. It has this to
encourage it —the South Blocks (now Zinc
Corp.) was of small account until a greater
depth than that was reached.
Electrolytic Zinc's net profit for 12 months
to June 30 was £390,077 as against £420,699
in 1926 and £375,380 in 1925. The average
price of zinc was £3l 17s. 9d. compared with
£35 17s. the year before; so the result is
extraordinarily good. Still, it has to be
remembered that Electrolytic Zinc is not
primarily a miner: it buys its product. So
it isn’t affected by the fall in metals like the
B. H. South, North, etc., are. Of course, it
has its own Tas. West Coast mines; but
work there is mainly developmental so far.
One of the most cheerful features of the
report is the statement that more than one-
tliird of the co.’s production is now con-
sumed in Australia; and there is a super-
phosphate works, too, through which local
demand materially assists the co. These
works were almost a hobby of former general-
manager Gepp : he saw in them a means of
vastly improving the agriculture of the little
island State in which the whole business is
carried on. The co. paid 12 p.c. again—-
1924, all shares 9 p.c.; 1925, 11 \ p.c.; 1926
and 1927, 12 p.c. Share capital is £2,600,009
and debenture capital £404,033, and total
reserves are £1,170,307, but that includes
depreciation reserve.

From the Stantliorpe alluvials SSJ tons
of tin oxide were dragged during the quarter
ending September 30. This isn’t bad going
from a field that was showing definite decrepi-
tude a couple of years back. The Sugar-
loaf co. has four plants working now, and
better water is assured for the present term.
Returns should further increase. Glen Aplin
dredge has just removed to a new location;
the clean-up from the last site was very low
—about 41b. to the yard. The small return
—l3ewt. cones, from 2950 yards—is said
to be due to trouble with cemented wash.
This may be so, but it is also certain they
are in a very pockety area, and the initial
Bulletin criticism of the estimates of oxide
made by Edgar Hall and his confreres a*
couple of years ago have not so far been
wide of the mark.

Queensland’s gold returns for the nine
months ending with September showed a rise
of over 13,0000 z. and a value increase of
£55,534 as compared with the same period
last year. Unfortunately it was almost
entirely due to the Mount Morgan clean up,
which is expected to come to an end next
month. When that happens, the stuff won
will hardly suffice to fill a decent “shammy.”
The September yield was 32460 z., compared
with 418 oz. for the same month last year,
and Morgan’s share was 25130 z. Other
shows were headed with Mount Coolon’s
3580 z.

The battle of railway routes to Wiluna
has begun, and the Wiluna Railway League
has joined forces with those who are fighting
to have the line built from Leonora, though
to link up with this centre in preference to
Meekatharra or Sandstone would mean an
additional 80 miles of rails. In the case of
the Wiluna Gold Mines, Ltd., which is
straining every effort to show the greatest
profit on moderately low-grade ore, the extra
SO miles railage would mean an increase of
£15,000 to £20,000 per annum in transport
costs.

Great Boulders (W.A.) have had a good
rise as a result of bore-hole development near
the Golden Horseshoe boundary, at 2650 ft.
The find is said to have “given a new lease
of life to the mine, to have enhanced the
value of property of all sorts at Kalgoorlie.
and to make many who in recent years sold
their holdings for a song and sought fresh
fields wish they hadn’t.” Something is also
said of how little mine-managers know about
their properties and the advisableness of
freely using the diamond drill to extend their
knowledge. Further bores are to be put in
north and south to prove the length of the
shoot, and until this work has been done
and assay results obtained no reliable esti-
mate of the value of the discovery can be
formed. One diamond drill stab is not
enough.

tin deposits” near Marble Bar (W.A.), and
a co. has been formed to acquire “some of
the richest tin-bearing ground in the Com-
monwealth.” To make sure, however, the
directors are sending James Hebbard, one of
their number, to inspect and report, and if
he isn’t satisfied with prospects all capital
subscribed will be returned, less a small
percentage for preliminary expenses. Heb-
bard is the very capable man who used to
be manager of the Sulphide Corporation’s
Central B. H. mine.

Tasmanite Shale Oil Co., which is a
merger of the New Southern Cross Motor
Fuels Co. and the Tasmanite Shale Oil Syn-
dicate, has set out to extract oil from shale
by the Long retort system at Latrobe (Tas.).
The public is asked for £22,000 (110,000
shares at 45.), of which the vendor takes
£lOOO, and £lO,OOO will be used to wipe out
the New Southern Cross Co.’s debts. In
addition the vendor takes £36,000 in fully-
paids. The assets include a license to use
the Long retort in Tas., rental not stated,
the lease of a mine from the Railton Latrobe
Co. for nine years and the plant on the mine.
The new co. is to pay a royalty of Is. per
ton to the Railton Latrobe co. Success will
largely depend upon the economical treat-
ment of a band of rock between the upper
and lower seams of oil shale.

Marranboy Co. (N.T.), which recently
put 80 tons tin ore through the Government
mill for 2.9 tons concentrates, has every-
thing in readiness for its new 20-head bat-
tery, now on its way from Darwin to the
field. There is enough average 2$ p.c. stuff
on the property to keep the stamps going
full time for the next 10 years, W. T. Pearce
says. A2l p.c. lode Bft. wide is exposed at
100 ft. in the northern shaft, and at 40ft.
on the western lease there is 4ft. of 5 p.c.
ore.

“Oil Shaler”: —
A recent cable stated that L. and N. Coal Distil-
lation Co. would shortly carry out tests with 40 tons
of Morvvell (Vic.) brown coal. Ten tons will be set
apart for a trial under every known method in
Germany, including briquetting, distilling and pul-
verising. A German, Dr. Jakobhenke, has been
appointed technical adviser. All this would indicate
that L. and N. Co. has not perfected its process and
was groping round for the latest German method of
treatment. Yet H. A. Bradstreet, the Australian direc-
tor of the co., says the machinery of a 100-ton retort
was ordered from Germany in August and will reach
Melbourne shortly. This retort is to extract 2800
gallons of crude oil at the rate of 28 gallons to
the ton and 300,000 c.f. of gas from 100 tons of
brown coal. The big plant would take only three
men to operate it, which sounds like an industrial
fairy tale.

When Selayang, British Malaya’s F.M.S.
flotation, started digging in August last,
after various delays, Australian shareholders
were gratified with the result of the pre-
liminary canter, which returned eight tons
from 25,000 yards, an average of ,731 b. A
subsequent call for £35,000 took some of the
sparkle out of things, but all settled down
to await the September returns. These
proved disappointing—ls tons from 82,000
yards, or only ,411 b. to the yard. However,
the management’s explanation that the
dredge w T as only cleaning up material on the
edge of the property may be accepted, for
such preliminaries are necessary, if exas-
perating to anxious shareholders. Better
values should soon be shown, and we shall
also know whether there are limestone pin-
nacles lying in wait for the buckets, as the
pessimists declare.
❖ ❖ ❖ ❖
Austral Asiatic, a Sydney holding and
prospecting co. with Joseph Tomlinson as
chairman, has completed the flotation of
Muang, which is to operate near Ban Nasan,
in Southern Siam. Muang’s capital is
£150,000 in £1 shares, and the parent co.
received 13,300 of these, fully paid, and £2900
in cash. The dredge has been ordered;
delivery of the pontoon is expected on board
ship by next March, and the balance should
be shipped by the end of the following July.
Tarua, a smaller property near Muang, of
which favorable reports were obtained, is
still being investigated, while the co.’s option
at Maliwan, in Southern Burma, has been
relinquished, after testing. The Alluvial Tin
staff has recently been engaged in boring
a property at Huey Yot for Thomo Tin.
This property has been bored several times
with conflicting results, but the holders are
evidently determined to get to the bottom of
it, if trying can do anything.
•I : : ! ;
Ratrut Basin is finding its transfer of
plant and material from the old area at
Renong in Western Siam to the new property
at Sichon a long and expensive job. The
old dredge is now on the Sichon ground, and
erection should begin this month, while the
new dredge (150,000 c.y. monthly) is ex-
pected to be running this time next year.
Authorised capital is £250.000 in £1 shares.
Capital issued is in 180,000 f.p. shares and
70,000 contribs., of which 50,000 were offered
to shareholders at a premium of ss. per
share in February last, and 20,000 were sub-
scribed by the vendors of the Sichon pro-
perty. The contribs. were taken up by share-
holders at ss. on application and ss. on
allotment. A second call of ss. per share, or
15s. to date, has been made by the directors
and is payable at the Sydney or Penang
offices on Wednesday, November 9. Divi-
dends at the rate of 6d. per share per
quarter are being paid till the original dredge
sets in on the new ground.

H. C. Millard (B. 11/8/’27)
assumed that he was the first geologist to
make an aerial survey in search of oil. He
is wrong, I think, as in 1922-23 aerial sur-
veys were made by Dr. Stanislaw Zuber, of
Lemburg, who is an authority on the Baku
oil-fields. Some very striking photographs
were obtained ; but it should be noted that
the regions were sparsely covered and tim-
bered, whereas the cloaked territory of New
Guinea would effectually conceal most geo-
logical evidence. Dr. Zuber’s objectives were:
(1) Observations of submarine mud volcanoes
belonging to the system of the Baku Archipelago.
(2) Observation of various geological phenomena
on land and on the bed of the ocean.
(3) To make hydrographical investigations.
(4) To make various climatological investigations.
His photographs show wonderful possibili-
ties from a topo-geological viewpoint, which
study on the ground could not satisfactorily
reveal. The observations are considered to
have greatly improved the available know-
ledge concerning the Baku oil-bearing areas.

With all his faults and follies, when Lang
left the Premier’s office there were no loud
hosannas from the men who had worked
nearest him. With few exceptions Lang
impressed them as a good boss, easy to get
on with, and vastly more self-reliant than
most of his recent predecessors—there is a
tradition that George Fuller, for instance,
never sneezed without hurriedly ringing a
bell and asking a clerk whether there was
any departmental objection to it.
S. E. LAMB, K.C., who represented the
S. M. HERALD before the Piddington
Royal Commission.
Youth is not to the fore in the new
N.S.W. Assembly. The youngest man .among
the novitiates is It. Cameron, the Wallsend
Laborite, who is 28. The other new Labor-
ites are in the thirties, except Clyne, Stanley
and Bernard Olde, who are 41, 42 and 55
respectively. J. Ross, 35, is the youngest
Nationalist. B. S. Stevens is 38, E. L.
Sanders 40 and A. Goldstein, E. S. Marks,
L. O. Martin and E. P. Tressider are 50.
The list of M’s.L.A. slaughtered at the
N.S.W. elections was long. There were a
few valiant deaths, as when P. J. Minahan
tackled Lang, and Doe, who represented
Sturt, had a go at Lysaght. In Castlereagh,
Thorby slew J. A. Clark ; and at Bondi Miss
Preston Stanley, the State’s first woman
legislator, lost to the independent Nation-
alist ; Tom Hoskins, who ran free of the
machine at Dulwich Hill, went down before
Ness, who had gained the endorsement. Ex-
Lord Mayor Stokes took the count in
Monaro, Lane lost at Leichhardt, Skelton
waved the “Protestant Labor’’ banner in
vain, and McClelland was beaten by his C.P.
opponent. The Labor moderates did badly.
Loughlin alone of those who failed made a
showing. Murphy, Cann, Alldis, Goodin and
Gillies were also-rans.
Patsy Leahy, Queensland journalist, poli-
tician and, later, newspaper proprietor, has
scanned his last revise. He was the first
man to introduce the “chain newspaper” idea
to the northern State. Wherever there was
a moribund sheet looking for a purchaser,
Paddy was sure to be found, and he generally
managed to turn it into a modest dividend
payer at the least. A prominent figure in
the farming world, he sat in the State Par-
liament long ago as member for the pastoral
constituency of Warrego, now the undisputed
fief of Randolph Bedford. For a period he
was Minister for Mines and Works, and was
leader of the anti-Labor forces in the Legis-
lative Council when it committed hari-kari.
W. R. Bell, killed recently on the east
coast of Malaita, was old as island officials
die, being close on 50. He was an old hand
in island lore, for lie had been a Government
inspector of native labor for seven years
before he was appointed District Commis-
sioner on Malaita, in 1918. In earlier years
he had been a Government agent on
recruiting craft.
The beer-taps ran hot in a Paddington
hotel on the Monday follownig the N.S.W.
State elections—the victory of Mick O’Sulli-
van in Woollahra was being celebrated. In
the ancient days free beer was a necessary
ingredient of an election. Even the friends
of “Tomato” Jessep, long the elect ol
Waverley, although their man was a
rabid Prohibitionist, used to have barrels
of beer put outside the Tea Gardens hotel for
the refreshment of possible supporters. But
the beer of those days was an election bribe,
which was cut off directly the poll was de-
clared. Mick O’Sullivan’s hotel is on the
boundary line of Paddington and Woollahra
electorates, and many a Paddington elector
felt that a little politeness for one day in
the year was well worth while.
James Forsyth, managing director of
Burns, Philp in Queensland, bade life so-
long at 75. One of that fine band of Scots-
men who have figured prominently in the
development of the northern State, Jeames
began his career at Croydon, then a flourish-
ing goldfield, in company with his brother
Archie. After a while he linked up with
what was the beginnings of Burns, Philp,
and lived to become one of the mainstays of
the firm. For years he sat in Queensland
Assembly as member for Carpentaria, retir-
ing in 1918. With Ross Munro, Robert
Philp and others he acquired pastoral inter-
ests in his latter days, among the holdings
in which he had a share being Thylunga,
near Eulo, one of the biggest runs in
Queensland.
Passed out recently at Port Moresby,
Papua, Archie Macalpine, possibly the best-
known man in the Territory. Thirty-three
years ago he deserted N.Q. for the island.
At one time he was general manager of
Rupert Clarke’s rubber plantations, and was
one of the party that accompanied the baro-
net on the Fly River expedition. What Mac-
alpine didn’t know about natives, their
customs and languages was not worth know-
ing. Blackwater fever and malaria took
him at 48.
Lew Herman, who has been elected Grand
President of the N.S.W. Druids, had his
share in some political history. Herman was
secretary of the Clerks’ Union during some
of its days of struggle. He* was a loyal
henchman of W. A. Holman. On one occa-
sion the qualification of a nominee of Hol-
man for selection for a country electorate
was questioned. His necessary three years’
allegiance to the Labor movement depended
on his Clerks’ Union membership. Holman,
his secretary (Frank Edwards) and Herman
wore ordered to toe the mat. Holman and
Edwards escaped, but the Labor Executive
axe fell on Herman. Luck comes in funny
guises; Herman dropped' politics, set up as
a manufacturer, and made a success of it.
William Booth Hodgetts, just dead at
Landsborough (Vic.), held a record that
does not figure in the sporting guides. For 50
years he was returned unopposed as council-
lor for the West Riding of the Avoca Shire
Council.
King Billy, who took the Last Track at
Quearibeyan (N.S.W.) recently, was the most
distinguished of the few remaining Monaro
abos. There will be record of him long
after the rest of the tribe have become but
a memory ; he w 7 as the model for the cast of
an aborigine in the Sydney Museum, and
many sculptors and painters used him. The
old man was about 80 years of age. He got
his status from his relationship to Queen
Nelly, who was a personality amongst the
Canberra blacks years ago. A suggestion
has been made that a monument to him
should _be erected at Canberra to serve as a
memorial to an expiring race.
Hobart will lose one of its tourist attrac-
tions when photographer J. W. Beatties
collection of" historical relics goes north to
Launceston. The best-known of the relics
are perhaps the odds and ends connected with
Port Arthur, but the most valuable is a Cip-
riani painting, said to have been bought
from the artist for £3OOO by Charles
Wedge in 1790. Wedge brought the pic-
ture with him when he came to Van Die-
men’s Land in the 1820’s. It remained
in the family until 1921, when Beattie
bought it. Of less value but greater interest
are two caricatures by Thomas Wainwright,
the poisoner, picked up in a hostelry
known to old Hobart Town as the Spotted
Cow.
Ex-High Commissioner JOE COOK is glad
to be back again, thank you so much.
San Salvador Alfred Case, who passed
over in Melbourne recently, varied the trade
of making guns with the recreation of fancy-
work. He put more than 2,000,000 stitches
into one piece of tapestry depicting Mary
Queen of Scots shedding tears on the body
of the Douglas at Langside, and he refused
500 guineas from William Clarke. Bart., when,
his masterpiece was done. He began it in
1880 and finished it in 1882. Flo Young’s
father set him to the deed.
Dr. Arthur, the dapper little medico who
easily retained Mosman for the Nationalists
at the Ma State’s general election, entered
St. Andrew’s, Edinburgh, when he was 14
years of age, was Master of Arts at 18 and
took his medical degree when he was 22.
After this he did good work in the Edin-
burgh slums until ill-health brought him to
Australia. He returned to England within
a year and was made medical superintendent
of a mission among the poor of East Lon-
don. But sickness once more forced him to
seek the southern sunshine. One of the
veteran members of the N.S.W. Assembly, he
first secured election at Middle Harbor in
1904, and, whatever the changes in name
and boundaries, Mosman has encored him
ever since.
D. W. Harvey Patterson has retired from
the board of directors of the Broken
Hill Proprietary Co., of which he has
been a member for 42 years His name
appeared on the first prospectus as one of
nine directors; the only other survivor
of that group is Bowes Kelly. Harvey
Patterson bought a twenty-eighth share from
David James for £lBOO when a find of
chloride of silver had been made, and the
original 34 shares jumped in price to £4500
each. Patterson held tenaciously to his
original scrip and collected shares and divs.
in all the offshoot companies. And in the
quietness of his retirement he can look back
and mark his judgment “Excellent.”
Robin John Tillyard, head of the Caw-
thron Institute, Nelson (M.L.), who has
crossed the Tasman to tell the Research
Council what lie knows about insects that
prey on plant parasites, was born at Nor-
wich, England, 46 years ago. After getting
his D.Sc. at Cambridge he spent nine years
in Sydney as Science and maths, master at
the Grammar School, and while lie was
there he qualified for Sydney Uni.’s D.Sc.
He has specialised on insects nearly all his
life, and since he has been with the Caw-
thron Institute has introduced dozens of
strange bugs to Maoriland and found useful
jobs for them to do: ' ~
A man who preferred chasing birds but
did some able administrative work for Britain
was Charles Morris Woodford, who was
Deputy-Commissioner at Samoa in 3895 and
from the following year until 1914 Resident
Commissioner of the British Solomons. In
earlier years he had been venturing about
the islands in pursuit of knowledge of birds
and natives. His “A Naturalist Amongst
Head-hunters” is a classic in its class. He
had known 75 years when he died the other
day, and lie filled most of them to the 365th
day.
Still another story of how war-correspon-
dent Frank Basil Riley came to liis end is
going the rounds of the treaty-ports in
China. It is to the effect that when he
started on the walk from which he never
returned he was temporarily indisposed, and
that sunstroke knocked him over while he
was passing through a village. Fearing
complications with the authorities, the vil-
lagers buried him and kept their counsel.
The Asiatic can generally be trusted to act
that way where white men are concerned.
An Australian cableman in Java some years
ago was badly gored by a buffalo of the so-
called domestic breed. After crawling on all
fours through the ricefields and across a
stream, he reached a village. The spectacle
struck the natives as one difficult to explain
to the police, so the entire population estab-
lished an alibi by retiring indoors and lock-
ing itself in.
Although the intended resignation of
Jimmy Mitchell as N.S.W. Commissioner of
Police was denied just before the elections,
his application for leave to retire followed
the defeat of the Labor Government. Mit-
chell, who is an Aberdeen Scotchman, joined
up with the N.S.W. police as a young man
of 19. He became Assistant-Inspector
General late in 1914 and Inspector-General
three months later —the job was subse-
quently changed to Chief Commissioner. His
total of service is 43 years.
At the N.S.W. Local Government Clerks’
conference the brothers Yeness could tell
offhand almost everything there was to be
told about town clerking. A.A. has looked
after tin* civic affairs of Glen Innes for 41
years. D.F.W. has been for 36 years at
Bathurst, and before transferring to the
City of the Plains he looked after the
Tamworth Council for 14 years.
The South-street competitions at Ballarat
produced the usual infant prodigy, but in
this case lie seems to be a normal healthy
boy as well as a remarkable violinist for
his age. He is Paul McDermott, of Coburg
(Vic.). Last year he won first prize in the
under 18 and open events, and this year
he won prizes in the under 12, under 14,
under 18 and under anything section. His
natural bent was shown when he w T as four:
a discord struck on the family piano was a
worse punishment than a spanking.
Mr. BAVIN—ARRIVED.
Archdeacon Boyce, of Sydney, one of the
chief opponents of the removal of St.
Andrew’s Cathedral to Macquarie-street, has
passed his 83rd milestone. Born in Devon,
he arrived in Australia 74 years ago. Sent
to Molong shortly after his ordination in
1868, he had a parish extending as far west
as the Bogan. He later became organising
missioner ; one round journey in those days
involved 2000 miles in the saddle. On many
of his trips an aboriginal guide was his only
companion.
THE ORACLE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Oh no! I wouldn’t go so far as say that
you was wrong;
You got an inklin’ of the truth—l seen that
all along.
I know damn well that there’s a lot in wot
yer cornin’ at,
But still an’ all, you take my tip, ’tain't
altogether that.
Yer argument is right enough, although it
ain’t too clear,
An’ yer ideas is pretty good. I give you
credit there;
A man that knows can see that you ain’t
torkin’ through yer ’at,
But, all the same, you mark my words,
’tain’t altogether that.
Er course a man will make mistakes, especi-
ally when young.
I don’t ’old that agin you, lad; why, even
I’ve bin stung.
I don’t expeck a chap like you to jerry on
’is pat.
You ain’t so far astray, but still ’tain’t alto-
gether that.
You don’t go deep enough, me lad —that’s all
that’s wrong with you,
And there’s a lot of other things you gotter
keep in view.
You ain’t quite got the ’ang of ’er, an’ that’s
the dinkum chat,
An’ though I like yer argument, ’tain’t. alto-

“V.E.” The Papuan animal mentioned by
“Momokeni” <'B. 22/9/’27) is a cucus, which
has a long preliensible tail and somewhat

“Is this where you live?”
“I d’know. Ring bell, o’ fellow, an’ shee—’sh no harm in asking.”
resembles the 'possum of Australia. There
are said to be three species of cucuses native
to New Guinea. They live in trees and feed
chiefly on leaves, but, like our ’possum, some-
times steal cultivated vegetables and fruits.
The fuzzy-headed people eat the animal and
consider him good meat, but for the Euro-
pean palate the flesh is too strongly flavored.
In some parts of Papua the chiefs deck
their polls with strips of brown-furred cucus
skin, which they reckon act as love-charms
to attract the copper-colored ladies of their
choice.

“Cliinta”: Whether sharks turn on their
backs to take a bait (B. 22/9/’27) depends
entirely on the position of the morsel offered.
I have studied the shark family for three
years in the Islands,
and at the expense of
hundreds of them
have derived not only
considerable sport but
some knowledge of
their habits. Owing to
the peculiar position
of his mouth, the
shark finds, when tak
ing a bait on the sur-
face, that it is just a
little more convenient
to roll over on his side
to do so. When the
bait is submerged in
the water or lying on
the bottom such a pro-
cedure is unnecessary; I have never then
seen him take a bait in any other position
than with Ins back uppermost.

“Dinkum” ; Bushmen of the Maryborough
district (Q.) are puzzled over a curious
discovery made by a farmer of Tinana, and
an explanation is being sought, but so far
without much result. The farmer noticed
that about 20 redgum-trees on his farm had
been chewed by some unknown creature, big
chips several inches thick being strewn
around. The point of attack was generally
six or eight feet from the ground, and the
animal had left no other marks than those
made by its teeth or claws, whichever it
used. The object of - the chewing was plainly
to reach the large, white woodgrubs, the
homes of which in every instance were
located. Sense of smell must have guided
the animal, for there is nothing on the out-
side of the trees to indicate that a grub was
living in the sapling. The trees attacked
were from two to nine inches in diameter.
In some quarters black cockatoos are held
responsible, but the size of the chips stands
in the way of this theory. Can any Abo.
throw light on the subject?
* * * *
“Toby C.”: At one time pegging out
’possum-skins on trees or logs was a tedious
job. Nowadays the cyanider simply sticks
the skin to any suitable surface or bare
patch of mother earth ; the moisture on the
pelt will hold it secure. It can then be
drawn out to the required shape and patted
down firmly; it will remain stuck until quite
dry. The dryer it gets, the firmer it grips.
The drying process is carried on well away
from the camp, as the law in some States is
snappy regarding ’possum-skins out of
season.
“Wang”: “Y’ can skite about your ’igh-
class jumpin’ ’orses,” said old Dan, “but I’ve
never seen nothink that can come near a

“AdeL”: My first acquaintance with the
pelican as a table delicacy (B. 28/7/,’27)
was during the Spanish-American war. I
was one of the crew of a West Indian
schooner chartered by the Spaniards and
bottled by the Yanks in a rock-strewn inlet
on one of the numerous islets off the coast
of Ilayti. The salt-pork and weevily biscuit
having petered out, our skipper sent us to
forage the barren island, which proved to be
a pelicans’ sanctuary. The larger birds were
easily killed with sticks, and half an hour
daily of butchering and egg-picking pro-
visioned our iCreole cook, who for 17 days
fed us on pelican dishes, with occasional
fish and crabs by way of variety. During
the whole period he never failed to serve
us with appetising meals of curried poultry,
pies, omelettes in brandy, and custard tarts,
all provided by the pelicans and their
product.

“Tassie”: Can any Abo. tell me what
exactly native bread is? I always under-
stood it to be a fungus growth, but now a
N.W. Coast (Tas.) farmer declares it to
be the hardened sap from a tree. Some fine
specimens of this bread were found on his
land, and a connection was traced from them
to an old tree; but I have seen loaves weigh-
ing up to 121 b. unearthed from clear, open
paddocks, in all classes of soil except
mineral-bearing country. Has anyone found
a use for this bread?
* * * *
“Sea Nomad” : The Devil was recently let
loose on Yam Island. Balsa and Miami were
going to be married, and Balsa had brought
from Thursday Island a young bull calf.
As the cutter crew slung the dinghy over-
board and manhandled the calf into it, all
the people flocked to the beach. They had
never seen a “bull-cow” before. In his
anxiety to reach dry land, the calf upset the
dinghy and, with a bawl that shook the palm’
tops, made straight for the crowd. A par-
ticularly red lava-lava on a brown-limbed
girl was his special objective. She leapt
for a palm-tree, and, paralysed with fear,
hung there a second until the calf’s slobber-
ing nose nuzzled her. With an awful cry
she fairly flew up the tree. The calf then
turned his attention to the astonished crowd.
With tail and hooves in the air he passed
strong men shinning up cocoanut-palms, con-
fining his attention to the women and child-
ren, who made frantically for the nearest
grass-thatched house. Bawling, he mixed
liimself into the jumble, and presently half
the side of the house came down, pierced
through with a score of kicking legs. Then
the calf cleaned up the village of its terrified
fowls, bucks in the palm tops slinging cocoa-
nuts at him as he cavorted underneath. The
only valiant man in the village was the sor-
cerer, who had to put up a show for his
profession. The calf lowered his head for
the sorcerer’s posterior, but missed; he col-
lected a polthogue on the side of the ear
from a stone club in return. Bellowing in
disapproval of this unsportsmanlike con-
duct, he charged some girls hiding in a
banana garden. Finally the sorcerer, with
dire threats, gathered the cutter’s crew and
all the village warriors about him' and rushed
the fearsome beast.
* * * *
“Toonoobra”: Occasionally the searcher
along the cays and atoll lagoons of the
Great Barrier Reef finds a small, drab,
rough-shelled gastropod, the lip of which is
stained a glorious salmon-pink. This is the
murex shell, closely related to that found in
the Mediterranean, which brought fame to
Tyre and Sidon. In ancient Crete it was
discovered that each murex shell-fish secreted
a drop of milky fluid in a sac, which, after
extraction and exposure, became green, then
blue and finally a fixed deep reddish-purple.
This murex-purple dye was traded exten-
sively by the Phoenicians and was considered
a noble and sacred color, emblematic of the
power of the gods. Purple-yielding shells
were sought, found and used as far east as
China and Japan. In Japan the shell-
purple industry has survived; in the inter-
vening area of Oceania no trace of it has
been found.
* * * *
“Gouger” : The “cat’s-eye” shell, treasured
by girls for bracelets, has an adventurous
life. Clinging first to the roots of a coral
growth deep in the water, it comes up when
matured with the tides and the change of the
seasons, gradually developing into what the
Islanders call “door belonga house.” When
the fish for safety draws within its shell,
the “cat’s-eye” portion also recedes till it
completely closes the entrance. Around
almost every giant clam-shell on the reef
is to be found a little pile of cat’s-eyes. I
often wondered how they came there; but
the Yam Island boys assure me that a species
of reef fish detaches the shellfish from its
hold on reef and rock and, carrying it to
the clam, drops it between the great shell
hinges, which immediately close and crush
the fish. The clam then opens and, not
liking the morsel, ejects the cat’s-eye, while
the brainy fish gobbles the meat from the
crushed shell.
* * * *
“Bayview” : Talking of seagulls, there’s a
flock of birds fed every day by a woman-
resident of Black Rock (Vic.). It has been
her custom to go down to the foreshore at
three o’clock every afternoon and give her
feathered friends a square meal. The gulls
can be depended on to be at the spot on
time. Should the provender be late they call
round at the home of the caterer uttering
weird cries till she appears with the tucker-
basket.

THE BLOKE THAT WE KNEW ONCE
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Me mostly was a little man with easy-going
ways,
Who took all things just as they came and
never looked for praise;
So simple was liis manner that some took
him for a dunce,
This quiet, unassuming chap, the Bloke That
We Knew Once.
To look at him you’d never think he had it
in him, but
You altered your opinion when he hopped
in for his cut;
He tamed the wildest outlaws, and upon
the biggest nark,
In the fierce fight he never sought, he left
his livid mark.
He swam the river high in flood to bring
the needed aid,
And the old sheds remember still the tallies
that he made.
It’s 1 pleasant to recall the way he stood up
to the boss;
In hot. long disputations he was never at a
loss.
He was the same upon the track or in the
busy street —
A better man or truer mate no one could
wish to meet;
lie never saw a cobber stuck, he knew what
mateship meant,
And none of us were ever broke till his last
bob was spent.
How precious is his memory as from the
ancient page
We read his great deeds to inspire this poor,
decadent age!
And never will his glory stale, though all
things else grow old.
The Bloke That We Kne\v Once will live
as long as lies are told.
W.A.
OSCAR WALTERS.

ADVANTAGES
MOTOR (Wisconsin) : Lubri-
cation by pressure feed
through drilled crank shaft—
the recognised best method.
Overhead valve mechanism
runs m bath of oil. Force
feed through hollow rocker
shaft.
GEAR BOX (Brown Lipe) :
Fitted with Timken tapered
roller bearings throughout.
Easily adjusted to take up
wear. Less risk of damage to
gear teeth.
DRIVE: Two-piece shaft with
Spicer universal joints—an
exceptionally good feature.
The “whipping” which occurs
with one-piece shafts is
eliminated. Final drive by
spiral bevel gear.
REAR AXLE: Of “full-float-
ing” type axle shaft carries
none of the truck’s weight,
but is used as a drive only.
Mounted on Timken tapered
roller bearings. There’s no
safer, more efficient system.
IGNITION: High-tension Mag-
neto most dependable for
all truck work—practically
foolproof.
ACCESSIBILITY: Cylinder
head removable, magneto and
carburettor both easily acces-
sible. Nothing intricate about
design of motor.
A motor that develops 50 h.p. at the low engine speed of 2 1 00 r.p.m.
naturally is subjected to less wear and tear on heavy service or fast runs.
And that is an important feature of the specially designed overhead
valve motor in the Brockway 35cwt. Model E Highway Express Speed
Truck. This explains the chief reason for its longer life and greater
reliability—-its lower maintenance and running costs.
Oil consumption is a little under half a pint per 1 000 miles —the
petrol average, 1 5 miles per gallon. Rated speed 40 m.p.h.
The Brockway chassis is exceptionally strong —braced with five
cross members. It mounts a roomy body—l 1 ft. x 6ft.
Before ordering any truck it will pay you to test the Brockway—a
convincing demonstration will be arranged whenever convenient. Write
to the nearest address below for particulars.
Brockway equipment is complete—two-unit starting and lighting
system, battery, electric headlights with dimmers, dash and tail lights,
electric horn, speedometer, rear vision mirror, power tyre pump, 5
32 x 6 cord tyres, extra rim and set of tools.

'Y'O those who can appreciate the beauty and
utility of superfine British engineering,
the Crossley will prove a veritable ‘joy for
ever.”
The exclusive workmanship that goes into
every single Crossley chassis is the chief
reason why the car costs a little more than
other comparable makes —but what a differ-
ence those few pounds make!
Nothing skimped—nothing let go as “good
enough”—every minute detail as perfect as
human skill can make it —that is why the
purchase of a Crossley Six may be regarded
as the event of a lifetime.
Every discriminating buyer should make a
point of seeing the British Crossley, and learn-
ing what it can do. We make no claims—
the car is its own best advocate.

“Murray” : On May 11 I noticed a Mur-
ray River turtle wandering up and down by
the side of a wire-netted fence about a
hundred yards from a lagoon. Failing to get
through, she scooped out a hole in the ground
about six inches deep and nine inches in
diameter, and therein deposited 20 eggs, neatly
arranged in rows ; she then filled in the hole
and levelled it off, the entire operation taking
about half an hour. Thereupon she made
her way back to the lagoon. I immediately
uncovered the eggs and re-buried them in
my garden under exactly similar conditions,
and enclosed the spot with small-gauge wire-
netting to prevent the escape of any young
turtles. Up to the present time none has
appeared. Can some Abo. tell me how long
the eggs should take to incubate? Is it
necessary to await the heat of summer?
* * * *
“Baomata”: “Reefer” assumes (B.
22/9/’27) that the diving dress referred to
by “Tiffy” is the respirator which was tried
some years ago in Thursday Island and
which, although permitting great depths to
be worked, had the disadvantage of leaving
the diver’s body unprotected. The new
dress is the invention of one Nishioka, a
A BAD MATCH.
“Looka here, Pietro, you mus’ washa da hand or keepa da thumb outa da soup. Da
customer notice da differen’ color.”
Broome (W.A.) Japanese, and was only
perfected and tried there for the first time
about the middle of 1926. It is an adapta-
tion of the Heinke dress. The interesting
feature is the helmet, in which an arrange-
ment of tubes carries a jet of air past the
diver’s mouth, the nose being closed by
clips similar to those in the Digger s gas-
mask. Air not breathed by the diver _is
passed into the surrounding sea. Inflation
of the dress is avoided, though it may be in-
flated to any extent wished by the diver,
whom it entirely protects from wet, sharks,
etc. This dress has not been used anywhere
but in the neighborhood of Broome, where
it has been successfully employed in So
fathoms of water —a greater depth than has
been obtained previously by any except the
cumbersome metal affairs weighing several
ton. It weighs about 85 pounds, and so far
from upsetting any of the known laws of
hydrostatics, as stated by “Reefer,” it sup-
ports them all. And it entirely eliminates
the possibility of paralysis, that bugbear of
the deep-water diver.
* * * *
“Kayeff” : I once knew a dentist who com-
bined business with a holiday trip through
the Islands, someone having suggested to
him that a profitable field of operations lay
among the white residents, who could not
get dental attention without going to Suva
or Sydney. He did good business with the
whites, but it was a fleabite to what came in
after he had filled a tooth for a native. The
glittering piece of gold in the young buck’s
frontispiece attracted the gaze of all eyes
and especially those of the dusky belles.
Boys from nine to ninety years dug up their
“schillins” and hurried off to have perfectly
good teeth drilled and gold-filled. Gold 20-
dollar pieces and “sarberans” that had been
buried for years were dug up and converted
into dental decorations.
* * * *
“Kai te Kuri”: The imported magpies in
Maoriland are keen enemies of the hawks
and attack them on sight. The male bird
generally directs the campaign. When a
hawk is sighted fairly close to the ground
the ladies make off some distance behind the
invader, then rise above and fly at him with
savage pecks that he doesn’t seem able to
parry; perhaps the dual attack flusters him.
The old man in the meantime has planted
himself in the nearest cover ahead of the
assault, and when the skirmish gets close he
rises and delivers a frontal charge. The
hawk usually escapes in a badly damaged
condition, but I have several times seen
the magpies bring their prey to earth.
* * * *
“AdeL”: The deep creeks which descend
from the coastal ranges west of Burketown
(N.Q.), to meander across well-grassed
plains, show, on their high perpendicular
banks, veins of lime and certain salts.
These are relished by cattle, which eat or
lick circular holes horizontally in the banks,
varying in size, but large enough for a beast
to bury its head and horns to the depth of
its neck; the shoulders prevent deeper
mining. Sometimes a large-headed beast, or
one with horns hooking backward, pokes its
head into a tight hole, and when withdraw-
ing its horns catch in the earth. The beast
then becomes frantic in an effort to free
itself, but the more it struggles the more
securely fixed the horns become. Thus
captured, the beast lingers in awful agony
for many hours till it dies either of suffoca-
tion or of a disjointed neck. Many are the
bleached bones hanging from holes on the
faces of creek-banks.
MAN OF LITTLE FAITH.
“But if someone stole your mare,
why won’t you tell the police-
man? He might be able to
track it for you.”
“Him track it! He couldn’t track
a barrel o’ tar through a
paddock o’ snow.”
“The Reefer”: From wet season to wet
season Papua’s big Fly River thinks nothing
of sweeping; away islands thousands ot acres
in extent and 'creating new ones. Men
who spend their lives navigating its intri-
cacies have to keep continuously swinging
the lead. The current is so swift and holds
so much sand in suspension that the hot-
toms of metalled craft working there glisten
like just-minted copper coins. Some years
ago natives on Uir.'uda located the bones of
an ancient wreck in the middle of that
island. It was fastened with pure copper
bolts several feet long and several inches
thick. John Cowling learnt of it and, vis-
ioning a Spanish galleon laden with chests
of doubloons, ducats and “pieces of eight, ;
had a gang prospecting with gum-diggers
poles, but they found only the forepeak.
* * * *
“Barangkali” : “Toonooba” (B. 22/9/’27)
reminds me of Puloh Tikus (“The Island
of Rats”) in the Cocos-Iveeling group.
Originally from a wreck, the rats on this
island have become countless, and show no
fear of man. All articles of food and even
toothpaste and soap must be storied in
sealed tins. We have made many attempts
to clear them out, sometimes securing a
fair bag, but never with complete success.
If any Abo. can suggest a really successful
campaign he will for ever be gratefully
remembered by the Cocos exiles.
* * * *
“Mullarula”: Because the bower-bird
makes its nest and playhouse remote from
humanity, many people think it is shy, but
let it get to know a human being and it is
quite the other way. One of them used to
visit my camp in the Pilliga scrub (N.S.W.).
He became so much at home that he thought
nothing of helping himself to jam from the
tin on the table when I was having a meal.
He always brought his missus along, but
she waited on a tree 50 yards away while
he paid his visit. The only one who had any
fault to find with these calls was my old
cattle-dog. who wasted a lot of energy in
rushing round the camp in search of imagin-
ary cats, for the bower-bird is one of the
best mimics in the bush.
* * *
“Morob”: In one of the smaller spurs of
the central ranges of New Guinea are some
curious caves which possess unusual powers
in causing echoes. One of these, situated
about 50 miles from Madang, in the Man-
dated Territory, is more a corridor than a
cave, and has an entrance which might be
passed half a dozen times without being
noticed. Inside, the slightest sound is rapidly
developed into a tremendous volume, which
keeps on rolling up and dowm for some
minutes. Even the sound of the dropping
of a small stone is rapidly swollen into a
noise that can be heard travelling backwards
and forwards until exhausted. In other
caves in the same district the characteristics
of the eelio are different. Throw a pebble
against one of these walls, and after a few
seconds there comes a roar which keeps
augmenting till its maximum intensity is
reached. It then stops, only to start again
some seconds later. A curious feature about
the echo in this cave is that it acts in the
way described only during the night time,
though in its darkness night is not dis-
tinguishable from day.
* * * *
“Pick”: An orchardist at Koorabira
(N.S.W.) had an old peach-tree broken off
by a gale. He sawed off the stump at the
ground level and left it to decay. The fol-
lowing spring, however, a sucker grew
from the stump, which, in its third autumn,
to the astonishment of its owner, produced
a fine crop of nectarines that ripened par-
ticularly late in the season. The orchardist
theory is that either, the nectarine grew
from a kernel dropped into a sun crack of the
old stump or that the original peach had
been grafted on a nectarine stem.
* * * *
“Veronal”: “Saylor’s” (B. 22/9/’27) de-
scription of the big fish he saw at Towns-
ville (N.Q.) fits the dolphin-fish (Cory-
phama hippurus) . This beautifully-colored
fellow is described by Gunther as “silvery-blue
above, with markings of deeper azure and
reflections of pure gold.” It is good eating,
as a rule, but sailors, according to Jordan
and Evermann, put a piece of silver into the
pot in which it has been cooked. If the
coin turns black they reckon the flesh poi-
sonous.
* * * *
“Murrungurry”: Tommy Saucepan, who
had become a teetotaller, was being pressed
to have a drop at a timber-getters’, camp.
But Tommy took a chew of tobacco instead.
“That feller make um too much cranky
here.” he said, tapping his forehead. “Then
’n,other blackfeller crack um cobra with
nulla nulla. When this feller come right an'
get timber, all about blackfeller gammon good
friend belonga me, an’ this feller don’t know
which one bin hit um. By cripes, this feller
keep sober now.”
* * * *
“Yufu”: Where is the thickest tree in Aus-
tralia? On a spur above the source of the
Orara River, North Coast (N.S.W.), there
is an old fire-scarred blackbutt that is 66
feet round the butt two feet off the ground.
The old warrior is not very tall, and half
his head is dead wood. A mile away is
another burnt-out shell through which two
cows can walk abreast.
SEVEN WHITE PONIES.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Seven white ponies of Gundagai,
Tough as a wliipthong, twelve-hands high,
Drinkin’ their fill from the mountain streams,
Blinkin’ brown eyes over sunshine dreams.
Seven white ponies of Gundagai,
Free as the hawk in the open sky,
Never been saddled nor groomed since
foaled,
Never man-handled though two year old.
Seven white ponies of Gundagai,
Hard-bitten brumbies all wild of eye,
Travellin’ the way of the overland trails,
Shaggy and dirty and hard as nails.
Seven white ponies from Gundagai!
Bridled and saddled an’ broken.... why ?
Pawin’ the tan in the horse bazaar,
Champin’ steel snaffles with nerves ajar!
Seven white ponies from Gundagai,
Groomed like racers and twice as shy,
Dreamin’ of Gundagai’s river-banks green,
Drinkin’ their fill from a soup-tureen.
Seven white ponies from Gundagai,
Scattered to seven new homes for aye,
Fed upon pop-corn and sugary things....
Seven small riders as happy as kings!

SELF-MADE FARMERS.
“^arrapinta”: Farmers can’t be made to
order, as the failure of land-settlement schemes
for ex-soldiers in Canada and Britain, as well
as our own costly soldier-settlement scheme,
have abundantly proved. And yet the two
most successful farmers I’ve met were
respectively captain of a cargo-boat and
a grocer before they took to the land. Each
spent a year on a farm before taking up land
of his own, and each financed himself with
his own savings. The most successful
poultry-farmer I know couldn’t have dis-
tinguished a Black Orpington from a crow
until, fed up with humping a carpenter’s bag
of tools, he decided to keep hens. He bought
books on the subject, paid a few visits to the
Government poultry-farm at Parafield
(S.A.), and then started keeping a few
pens of Leghorns in his back yard, to see if
he could make the business pay on a small
scale first. Finding he couid, he sold his
house to gain the necessary capital, and
launched out. He’s now in a position to
retire, if he wants to. Another man sold
liis tailor’s shop and paid a deposit on a
small sheep-run to give his two sons a better
opportunity in life than his shop offered.
Shortly after taking up the run they struck
the 1914 drought. Then, just as they began
to recover from this set-back, the two boys
thought it was time to enlist, and left the old
man to battle on alone. He made some costly
blunders through inexperience, but when the
two sons returned home in 1919 they found
dad had turned the corner on the road to
prosperity. Last year they bought out the
neighboring run.
HORSE-THROWING WITHOUT ROPES.
“N.M.L.”: Let’s throw a horse or two
without the aid of ropes. First we’ll tackle a
foal about six months old, one that we want
to throw carefully; he may some day sport
silk. Let him in the round yard with his
mother. Catch the old girl and put a bridle
on her. Lead her round the yard a couple
of times, getting the little joker used to our
presence, and then lead her out through the
gate, the foal either following behind or run-
ning on her off side. We’ll want our best
man at the gate.
As the old mare goes through the gate the
man stationed there edges nearer till lie
forces the foal back behind her. When the
mare is through, and the foal just on the
point of going, that man springs forward
and throws his right arm round the foal’s
neck. As the man is on the foal’s off-side
that means his right arm has to go under the
youngster’s neck. The more that foal bounds
and bucks the easier he is. It’s only the
fellow who spreads liis four legs, stands firm
and sulks, that’s hard to throw.
The man with his arm round the foal’s
neck presses for all he is worth on the
back of that neck, just in front of the
wither. As soon as things steady a bit—
which won’t be long-—he levers up with
his arm, pressing the foal’s muzzle sky-
wards, and, maintaining the pressure as
before, he swings his body slowly to the
left. That foal sinks to his haunches and
rolls over on liis side. The man falls with
the foal, and prevents it from struggling
right over and regaining its feet by doubling
its head right back to its shoulder. It’s
a help if the flank man is fairly lively and
whips the foal’s tail through its flank and
drops on it with his knees.
Now let’s take a full-grown horse and try
another way. We have a bridle on him.
The first rule of handling horses, broken
and unbroken, is to get in close to them.
Lean up against them if you can. It’s the
man who stands wide who gets hurt. Hav-
ing handled the horse a bit, and particularly
rubbed him —in passing, a mare is easier
to throw than a horse in this manner —about
the flank and buttocks so that it won’t take
fright, draw its tail between its hind legs
and up outside its near flank The beast
will bound a bit when you do that, and
perhaps kick. But if you’re standing in
close, when the horse steadies again you’re
still there. After a second or two it takes
no notice of its tail being through its flank.
Now hold the horse’s head round towards
you with the rein of the bridle—to catch
the ring of the bit is the best way—and for
all that’s in you pull upwards towards the
hip and hard in the flank with the tail
you’re holding. When that pressure is on
you needn’t worry a bit —it paralyses the
hind leg and a kick is an impossibility.
When you’ve got that leg hanging more or
less limp and useless lift your own right
leg, reach back and hook your toes round the
horse’s hock. Pull towards you with that
grip of your foot, keep the strain on the
tail, lean lightly on the ring of the bit, and
the horse sits down as gracefully as though
taught in a circus. Now you want to move
lively, quick and with a snap. Drop your
hold of. the tail while your mate falls forward
on the horse’s flank, and you snap with your
fingers at a point about three inches above
its near fore-knee. That’s stuck out straight
in front now, and straining. As soon as your
fingers pinch on that the leg is doubled under,
losing its power also to a certain extent, and
the horse rolls over on its side. Head doubled
back on the shoulder, a good man on the
flank, and the horse is down till you choose
to let it up.
SAVE GOOD SEED WHEAT.
“Homo”: Good seed wheat does not
mature evei’y year. Probably a farmer can
consider himself lucky if he produces a per-
fect sample every four or five years. The
wheat then that he considers fit for seed
should be stored in a rat-proof shed after
each bag has been graded and treated with
carbonate of copper. At leas;: one year’s
supply should be stored away. The seed will
germinate just as readily as new seed, and
weevils and other pests will not touch it if
stored as suggested. Smut spores will also
be put out of action. By this means the
farmer is sure of the quality of the seed
and its suitability for his land, and he runs
no risk of having to pay an exorbitant
price for it.
WHEAT ON DRIED LAGOONS.
“The Welkin”: The dry season having
made it possible, a Murray-River (N.S.W.)
squatter has utilised the dried-up lagoons
on his property to produce wheat crops.
The ground requires very little inducement
in the way of fertiliser to obtain good re-
sults from the seed, nor does it need plough-
ing. The seed is hand sown. Even now in
this dry time the earth at a depth of about
three inches retains moisture in these former
lagoons.
FARMING AND FORESTRY.
“Mullarula”: Few cockies seem to think
of combining farming and forestry, but
there is nothing fanciful or freakish about
the idea. Many farms have useless areas of
rocky and broken country which will not even
grow good grass, and which cannot be cul-
tivated. If this land were planted with some
of our quick-growing hardwoods, some of
which reach commercial size in well under
20 years, the owner would have a valuable
ipvestment, which would cost him nothing
after the first year or so. Even where the
soil is good for other purposes, particularly
in bleak, treeless areas, it would pay the
owner to withdraw strips along his boun-
daries from cultivation and plant them with
trees. The area seemingly lost in this
way would not really be lost at all, as it
would be more than paying its way by pro-
tecting the rest of the farm from the wind.
The timber grown there would thus be clear
profit. In the ’nineties the landholders in
the bleak and windswept south-west of Vic-
toria, where the native timber had disap-
peared, planted narrow belts of European fir
and pine as breakwinds to shelter their stock
in the winter. Seven or eight years ago they
were selling the trees at £5 apiece. Seeing
that the trees had been serving a useful pur-
pose a return of £125 an acre was not bad.
And that timber was only useful for making
packing-cases. Hardwoods ought to show a
better return.
VIRUS DISEASES OF PLANTS.
“Bios”: Virus diseases, a peculiar group
of infectious troubles, have caused enormous
losses in many types of cultivated plants.
Generally they increase in destructive-
ness with the progress of time, form' the
main section of the group of so-called de-
generation diseases and constitute the chief
reason for the fact that certain varieties
“run out.” Particularly is this true of
plants which are propagated by cuttings or
vegetative parts, as in the case of potatoes,
bananas and sugar-cane. However, many
other types of plants are also affected. Symp-
toms generally include dwarfing and some
type of mottling of the leaf, described by
the term “mosaics.”
The diseases are carried over from season
to season by means of infected stocks, and
may be transmitted to healthy plants by
insects which have been feeding on the
juices of diseased plants.
Bunchy-top in bananas is a well-known
local example in which the disease is trans-
mitted by the banana aphis. Quite recently
another serious trouble, spotted wilt or
bronzed wilt of the tomato, long believed
to belong to the virus group, has been proved
to be transmitted by the ordinary rose tlirips
insect.
The original cause of these maladies has
not been observed, and it has been suggested
that the infective agent is an organism of
such diminutive size that it is invisible to
the microscope.
Elimination of the insect carrier is im-
portant in all cases, but is generally commer-
cially imported in agricultural operations.
Far more important is it to remove the
diseased plant—the source of the infection —
lock, stock and barrel, as soon as the first
signs of trouble appear.
THAT BLESSED WORD “RESEARCH.”
“Dingo”: Whenever stockowners meet in
conference at least one ass is sure, to rise and
bleat about “research,” needless to say to be
conducted at the public experise. The bulk
of those addressed are not very clear as to
the meaning of the word, but it has a fine
resounding ring about it, like Mesopotamia
or a foreign loan. Research is to kill star
thistles, destroy rabbits, keep cattle and
sheep fat on drought-striken or overstocked
country, cure scours in calves and reduce
the price of sewing machines.
Science may do a lot for us some day,
but in the meantime we know enough about
swine fever, swine pneumonia, black leg,
most external and internal parasites, anthrax
and pleuro-pneumonia to put them under
heel within 12 months of the stockowner
learning to obey the law. Yet the losses they
cause go on unchecked pending the time
when research will banish them in a night.
The rabbit is also left in peace by many
till research shall exterminate him, though
thousands of landowners pushed him out
years ago with plain elbow-grease, and have
waxed rich as the result. Drought losses are
expected to be abolished by research with-
out the aid of water and fodder conserva-
tion.
The greater part of the cattle penned at
any big saleyard in Australia are such
mongrels that it is often hard to pick the
predominating breed. Better bulls and more
feed would double values, but research is
expected to put all that right. The' failure
of Australian beef abroad when up against
the Argentine product is put down to the
longer sea transit and freezing, but experts
have long known better and are only wearied
by the cry for more research. Forty per
cent, of pigs farrowed in N.S.W. fail to
become of any economic use largely through
bad hygienic conditions and resulting
diseases. Half of those marketed would
look more at home in Javanese jungles, so
there is nothing for it but research. The
queer half-starved mixture of breeds which
has replaced the Waler is to be made into a
horse again by research. Even our sheep
isn’t all lie might be, so research might get.
yet another task.
VEGETABLE-GROWING ON THE
iiawkesburY.
“XSA”: A few years hence most of
Sydney’s fresh vegetables will be grown in.
the liawkesbury Valley, and unless Aus-
tralian owners of these rich flats appreciate
their duty a swarm of Chinamen will reap
the benefit. Until recently corn and pump-
kins were the staple products, but one or
two of the enterprising whites who are left —■
notably Philip Charley, of Richmond, and
May, of Pitt Town Bottoms —pioneered with
vegetables; thus giving a lead to others.
These, however, are gradually leasing their
land to Chinamen, receiving as high as £l2
per acre per annum. In some cases the
owners and their sons are working on
wages for the Chow. Land recently brought
£lO6 per acre, and the price undoubtedly will
rise as the demand increases. Many thou-
sands of acres lie between renrith and Sack-
ville Reach, arid the good old Oxborough
conveniently intersects this area. As much
as £2OO per acre lias been taken for cauli-
flowers this year, and there remains yet
time to make it £3OO for the 12 months.
QUEENSLAND COTTON PROSPECTS.
“Carisbropk, Jun.”: The prospects of the
cotton industry in Queensland this season arc
particularly bright. In 1920, during the
planting season, there was a serious slump
in cotton, the Liverpool market-price drop-
ping from lOjd. to 6fd. per lb. Since then
the Queensland Cotton Board has succeeded
in improving marketing conditions, and pool-
ing arrangements have been made for the
ginning of cotton and the sale of seed. The
whole of the 1927 Queensland crop has been
marketed in Australia, at a price which,
with the Commonwealth bounty of lid. per
lb., ensures a return above world’s parity.
The failure of the American crop has
advanced the price-index of cotton from 950
to 1250. and there is at present a world's
shortage. Up to the present American
growers have commanded the market with
cheap black labor. While it has cost the
Australian grower 2jd. per lb. for labor the
American gets his work done for fd. per lb.
However, a mechanical picking device, the
invention of a Roma (Q.) cotton-grower, is
appearing on the market, and in tests has
picked the cotton at a cost of less than sd.
per lb. If Ferrier, the inventor, can establish
his picker on the Australian fields -he will
succeed in removing the biggest obstacle to
Australia’s successful entry on the world's
cotton markets.
DRAFTING METHODS.
“Te Hipi” : A good race saves much time
and labor when drafting. It should be built
just wide enough to let the sheep through.
If a sheep can turn its head round in the
race, the race is too wide. Should the race
be built for woolly sheep it is a good idea
to have a false side to bolt or otherwise fix
on when drafting shorn sheep or lambs.
Lambs are the nark, of the drafter, and are
always hard to work. Keep a few pet sheep
about the place and'!use them as decoys in
the yards. . It will pay handsomely to
train one or two orphan lambs for this work;
nearly all M.L. freezing-works have them,
and don’t train them for fun.
When culling out poor-constitutioned sheep
watch the noses. Many a small-sized sheep
has a good constitution and shape, and you’ll
come a thud if you cull on size alone. Throw
out the sheep with narrow noses and small
nostrils and you won’t miss any wasters.
When drafting on earmarks check your work
when turning the sheep out through a gate
after drafting. It shouldn’t be necessary,
but no man is infallible, and you might have
missed one. You can’t draft for wool through
a drafting-gate, so don’t try.
A FLEECE RECORD.
“Fred Rich”: The ram David, recently
purchased from F. McMaster, of Dalkeith
station, by F. S. Falkiner and Sons, of
Boonoke North, has created a new record
for heavy-fleeced sheep. With 12 months'
growth on David cut 41Mb., and when
scoured the fleece is expected to weigh 22
or 23 lb. The shearer who shore the ram
says he had the densest wool he ever handled,
being packed all over and extraordinarily
heavy underneath.
SCRUB FODDERS FOR SHEEP.
“N.M.L.”: “E..J.D.” (B. 28/7/’27) gave
his experience of edible scrubs in N.S.W..
or portions of it. Here’s my experience of
W.Q. Mulga is good—in fact, it is very
good; but sheep will not live indefinitely on
mulga alone. But I have known big mobs
of sheep do, and do reasonably well, on
mixed scrub. That means mulga, beefwood,
emu apple, supplejack, leopard wood, boree
and others. Mainly, I would say, the secret
of scrub feeding is to let the foliage dry a
bit before letting the sheep on it. We
found in the 1902 drought that it was best
to cut to-day arid let the sheep have that
cut to-morrow —always keeping the cutters
a day ahead of the sheep. I ‘don’t know
what men cut now, but in those days, in
fair scrub and taking it in a face, 700 sheep
a man was a fair allowance. Needless to
say that refers tol sheep shepherded on
scrub. In some cases—perhaps in the
majority of cases —men cut anywhere and
let, the sheep find the scrub themselves —
they soon learn to do it.
• The trouble with all scrubs is impaction.
I don’t doubt that a good lick, having as
part of its ingredients a suitable laxative,
would overcome much of this trouble; but
on some scrubs, boree for instance, the
fibres form in matted balls in spite of all
the purgatives the sheep can be given.
Perhaps the best of all scrub fodders which
grow in W.Q. is the vine-tree or supple-
jack. Unfortunately only small quantities
are available. The despised gidya, usually
classed as a foliage scorned by stock, will
be eaten by them readily after it has been
down three or four days. Particularly is
this the case in a country which is lacking
in saline herbs. I’ve known both sheep and
cattle strip a coolabah bare under those
conditions. That they would do well on
coolabah I would not say; but I do know
that, gidya, fed in the manner described,
will support life in stock. Camels, . when
gidya is available, will eat nothing else.
HARNESSING THAT TAINT.
“Carisbrook, .Tun.”: “Finn’s” par (B.
15/9/'27) stating that any strongly-flavored
diet will taint cow's milk has possibilities, to
my mind. For instance, a special diet of
garlic would ensure a ready market for milk
and butter in the North Queensland sugar
areas. A market could be found for Aus-
tralian butter in Ireland by systematically
feeding the cows on praties. A diet of
pounded beche-de-mer mixed with birds'-nests
would ensure dairy produce a wonderful re-
ception in the Far East, and Australia should
be able to capture the Japanese market if
Strawberry were fed on rice. But I have a
still bigger market in view. Why not judi-

ciously mix whisky or our fortified port with
the lucerne, and give it to the herd. In my
imagination I can already see the Americans
clamoring for Australian XXX butter _ or
Queensland cheese, born 1820, and getting
stronger every day. Our milk, in specially
sealed containers, would make a summer-
drink that no 100 per cent. American could
resist.
EGG-LAYING RECORDS.
“Villers-Bret.” : The Yanks claim that a lien
of theirs has broken the world’s record with
a tally of 358 eggs for 3G5 days. Australia’s
best to date is credited with 339 over the
same period. When it comes to ducks, our
tally will take some beating. A Maori-
land runner has a score of 305 eggs for 305
days to her credit.
DUBBING COCKERELS.
“Jack roint” : Whether or not caponising
is worth while, dubbing certainly is, especi-
ally for breeding males. The best time is
just before the cockerels reach maturity,
although it is never too late. Use a large
pair of scissors and first cut from the front of
the comb diagonally across, removing the
serrations. Next remove the blade of the
comb with a cut from the rear, and lastly the
major part of the wattles. To stop the
bleeding, use any of the well-known speci-
fics —a feather laid along the comb will
often be sufficient, or clean cobweb.. Another
excellent thing is the fine powder which is
found in dried puff-balls. If this is not
obtainable get some iron sub-sulphate from
the chemist, but remember it is poison. Dub-
bing should undoubtedly be practised much
more than it is, as nine leghorns out of ten
have too big combs, and the wattles are
also a source of annoyance when feeding.
As a general rule it is not necessary to dub
hens, but in cases where the comb is so
large that it obstructs the bird’s vision, it is
better to remove it. Don’t dub a couple of
dozen birds, though, and then let them loose
in a yard to eat each other; just do a few at
a time and place each one in a coop for a
few days until the cut is healed.
MAIZE FEEDING.
“E. J.D.”: Maize should be soaked or
boiled. It is more easily digested that way,
and it should be fed to sheep in feeders,
since it is half wasted when strewn on the
ground, and too much dirt is eaten with it.
The gluttons should be fed away from the
more timid ones, if possible. A ration of
coarse scrub, such as oak or belar, should be
given before grain. This enables the ani-
mals to make a cud, and a good cud is half
the battle.
Some green stuff (best scrub available)
should be given to sheep that are grain-fed.
This will to some extent neutralise the
fevering power of the grain. A lick con-
taining some such stuff as cream of tartar
is advocated by some.
AGAINST CINCTURING.
“Boronia”: “Allambee” (B. 8/9/’27) is
correct. Cincturing, besides encouraging
woolly aphis, provides a good breeding ground
for orchard pests, some of which are diffi-
cult to eradicate. Cincturing is not required
in commercial apple-orchards. The great
majority of the most popular varieties are
heavy bearers needing no encouragement.
These days quality rather than quantity
is aimed at, which explains why thinning
is resorted to by the growers of Jonathan,
Doherty, Cleopatra, Rokewood and Yate
apples.
BUD SELECTION.
“Yabbie” : There are a lot of pitfalls about
bud selection. Some of the soldier-settlers on
the ’Bidgee irrigation area, intent on planting
stud trees, obtained buds from the “best
Washington Navel” tree at the Yanco
Experimental Farm in 1920 and 1921. To-
day the progeny has turned out to be 90 per
cent, dry, worthless oranges; the “best
Washington Navel” was not a Washington
at all, but was a “Sport.”
“W.M.F.” (B. 18/8/’27) bewails the bad
quality of Australian grape-fruit, and sug-
gests bud selection to overcome the difficulty.
I watched buds being cut from a good type
grapefruit-tree at Yanco in 1921; saw the
buds inserted in their stocks; watched the
trees grow in the nursery; helped plant them
in the orchard, and have now sampled the
fruit of 40 of the trees. Every tree bears
a different quality and type of fruit, although
all originating from one branch of one tree.
This is. of course, not an argument against
bud selection but rather one for it. The
point is that we as yet know little about
which trees are most likely to throw progeny
which will have the largest percentage true
to type. This can only be found by long
experiment.
LUCERNE AND SAFFRON THISTLE.
“Saffron Grower”: “Five Furrows” (B.
S/9/’27) recommends rough ploughing or
the “clod-theory” method for checking saffron
thistles when sowing lucerne. But if the
soil isn’t Worked to a fine tilth most of the
lucerne seed will work its way down between
the clods to too great a depth and will never
force its way up, tho*ugh the saffron thistle
will quite easily come up from a depth of
six inches. This seed will lie in the ground
for a period of years till the hard outer
shell rots, or till a fire cracks it, and will
then germinate. The seed has been tested
and known to come up here (Burra, S.A.)
after lying in the ground for seven years.
But a decent crop of lucerne will soon settle
the thistle.
SCRUB TIMBERS.
“N.G.”: “J.H.S.” (B. 15/9/’27) errs
when he refers to cudgerie (Flindersia
schottiana) as “crow’s ash.” It is another
member of the family (Flindersia australis)
that provides this most valuable of all scrub
hardwoods and is known commercially as
crow’s ash to the trade everywhere in
Queensland. Richmond River settlers called
it “teak” in the “big scrub.” It is a hand-
some tree of beautiful foliage and often
grows to over 3000 super, feet. The timber
is oily, burns like a tar-barrel, lasts well in
the ground and is never touched by white-
ants.
“Flandowser,” referred to by is
merely the bullocky’s corruption of the
botanical name, Flindersia, and is usually
applied to the small-leafed member of the
family with the spotted bark —I think,
botanieally, F. collenia. This latter variety
is a valuable stave timber, but sawmillers
hate it because an acid in its sap keeps the
saw-sliarpeners busy.
Unless the Forestry Department takes
effective steps to promote their propagation
(and they are easily grown) all these beauti-
ful and valuable timbers will be irretrievably
lost, for they are purely scrub timbers and
are going with their rapidly vanishing
natural habitat.
HINTS FOR THE FARM.
“Carisbrook, Jun.”: When dehorning be
careful of the caustic, or you may kill the
beast. The hair should be carefully removed
around the hub of the horn on the calf’s
head, and the caustic should be carefully
applied on the bony substance. Little is
needed for the work, and, if necessary, the
operation can be renewed for a few days, the
hair being removed first in each case. With
the older animals a run is necessary into
which they can be jambed without a chance
of moving backwards or forwards. A swift
and clean job should be made with the de-
horning bar. Nothing looks worse, or is worse
for the beast, than a poor operation. If the
animal is firmly stanchioned, so that every
part of the body is held in perfect quiet,
there should be no difficulty. After the
operation as much care should be taken as
before, and the wounds should be daubed or
washed with hydrogen-peroxide or diluted
carbolic, and protected from flies or infection.
“Mimosa”: For common “itch” in horses
and, in fact, for most forms of dermatitis the
remedy is common soft-soap. Rub in and
let it stay for 20 hours. Then wash off
thoroughly with warm water and apply a
weak solution of iodine, lysol or similar dis-
infectant. Ringworms are wiped off the map
by the same treatment. I have' successfully
treated some thousands of horses and mules
by this method without a single failure.
“Saaedi” : When sheep that have died are
skinned in the paddock the skins should not
be flung over a near-by log to dry. They
should be taken home immediately and dried
in a shed. Skins that are left in the pad-
dock to dry deteriorate considerably, sun and
rain sometimes rendering them almost value-
less. Moreover when left in the open they
are likely to be torn by crows and hawks.
“Fred Rich”: A sure way of preventing a
horse from bucking is to place a strap round
the animal’s leg between the fetlock and the
knee, just tight enough to prevent it from
slipping. Before a horse bucks its muscles
naturally bunch and the tightening strap
prevents this. To make assurance doubly
sure a strap buckled above the knee with
side straps fastened to the one below to stop
it from slipping can be used.
“Te Hipi”: A cure for St. John’s wort
(B. 15/9/’27) might be had from the Caw-
thron Institute, Maoriland, or may even
be procurable in Australia. For years M.L.
cockies had been endeavoring to exterminate
ragwort, but were unsuccessful until the
introduction, by the institute, of a certain
butterfly. The grubs hatched from the eggs
of this now common variety proved sudden
death to the weeds. So far the grubs have
not attacked any other vegetation, but in one
district in which ragwort was once very
thick there is now hardly a specimen. The
butterfly responsible for this seems to be
dwindling, too, the absence of its only known
food probably being responsible. Possibly
the same grub might be used against the
Bright weed.
“The Welkin”: Strawberry very often jibs
when it comes to giving up her milk to a
stranger. An old trick successfully played as
an inducer is to press down on the top of her
back with the hands.
“The Welkin”: Re honey standards (B.
29/9/’27). I know of a beekeeper who cul-
tivates thyme for the sole purpose of pro-
curing quality honey from his bees. He has
been experimenting for years, and is now firm
in the conviction, shared by many English
apiarists, that thyme will produce the best
results.
“Ted R.” : The best and most humane way
of breaking a sheepdog off its biting habits
is to place a sheep’s knuckle or similar bone
crosswise in its mouth to form a bit, tying it
to each side of its collar to hold it
in position. When the dog goes to snap
his gums come into contact with the bone
and he is painfully reminded that he cannot
bite. A few days of this treatment will cause
the most confirmed biter to discard the habit.
“Ruru”: To cure scour in calves, boil a
small handful of gum-leaves (I use blue-
gum) in a gallon of water and give a table-
spoonful or so with the milk.
“Yufu”: The quickest way to plant out
spuds isn’t wfith a spade (B. 22/9/’27), hut
with a plough. Open up two furrows, then
walk along dropping the seed in the open
furrow. When the row is planted, send
round your plough again. This effectively
covers the tubers, and, by planting every
fourth furrow, you have even rows of a
width just nice to scarify when the plants
are up. Do not plough too deep.
“Boronia”: When using fencing staples
turn the sap side of a split post away from
the wire. In a year or two the sap side
becomes cracked and opens, with the result
that the staples fall out and let the wires
down.
“Yabbie” : Murrumbidgee irrigation cockies
are annoyed. About 14.000 acres are, or
have been, prepared for the coming rice crop.
Now the Irrigation Commission has issued
an edict that it will sell no water to any
rice-grower unless he first signs over his crop
on lien and also gives a bill of assignment
over all his chattels. Further, no water
will be issued to anyone if any lien whatever
is held by any outside party. Not even by
giving a first-mortgage over everything from
Strawberry to the brindle pup can the cocky
obtain water if the grocer has a little lien
as security for tucker received on tick. The
Commission makes an advance on the crop,
of course, but the cockies reckon the terms
are oppressive, especially as advances have
to be repaid on March 31, before the crops
can be harvested.

THE TOUCH.
The little man wearing the superannuated
garments and the drooping lemon-colored
moustache wormed his way through the
crowd at the entrance to the central station,
and stood for a moment or two looking
speculatively about him. His line of action
was determined by a burly gentleman who
was draping himself over the balustrades of
the bridge.
The little man shuffled up and stood re-
garding him fixedly for a moment or two.
The other cast a glance at his neighbor, and
resumed his contemplation of the river.
The little man crab-walked a few inches
nearer, and, clearing his throat, said:
“Excuse me, sir, but may I be permitted to
engage your attention for a minute or two?”
“Garn,” rumbled the other, not shifting
his eyes.
“Thank you, sir,” the little man said,
with enthusiasm. “I take it that you have
been good enough to signify your willingness
to listen to what I desire to say to you.”
“Shurrup,” said the other.
“Sir,” the little man replied, expostulat-
ingly, “I am prepared to apologise if I am
interrupting you in your contemplation of
the turgid stream that flows beneath.”
The burly party turned his eyes, and
parted his lips to speak.
“Now, sir,” the owner of the lemon-colored
moustache went on hurriedly, “I beg of you
not to give way to any expressions of annoy-
ance. I would regret exceedingly if my
presence here beside you would be the cause,
in any degree, of displeasure to you.”
The burly one turned his gaze to the
river again.
“It may be, sir,” the little man ran on,
“that I am interrupting self-communings of
a deeply private and domestic nature. You
may be thinking of your wife and bonny
children”
The other, for the first time, displayed
some interest. “Too right!” he grunted—
“wondering what sorter tale .1 ken pitch her
t’-night!”
The little man grasped his sleeve. “Ah,”
he exclaimed, “the thoughts of home must
indeed be joyous thoughts to a family man.”
Then, with definite sadness, lie added, “Alas,
I know none such. I am but a poor out-
cast, floating hither and thither on the
ocean of adversity, compelled by the exi-
gencies of the unfortunate position in which
I find myself to appeal to the generosity of

fits as they may be disposed to grant me.”
The big fellow turned half around. “Gor-
struth!” he muttered.
The little man was quick to take advant-
age of the interest he had awakened.
“Yes, sir,” he piped, “such is the unhappy
condition to which I am reduced. But I
notice an officer of the law approaching,
and I must be expeditious. Could you place

vancing me the small sum of sixpence?”

other pushed his hand into his trousers-

That natural beauty of skin and hair which
cannot be imitated can be obtained by regular
use of Rexona Skin and Facial Soap. Ordinary
toilet soaps do not assert this influence. Many
of them contain free alkali, which tends to dry
the skin and destroy its delicate texture. Even
the best of such soaps can only cleanse; they
cannot heal and protect the skin.
Rexona Soap contains the same soothing, healing, antiseptic
balsams as Rexona, the Rapid Healer, the value of which in the
treatment of skin affections is known throughout the world.
Simply use Rexona Skin and Facial Soap regularly once or twice
a day and see if it does not quickly soothe and cleanse the pores,
lessen the tendency to pimples and leave the complexion clear,
fresh and velvety.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
POINT Cooper is in North Queensland.
It is a bold green headland, and round-
ing it from the south one can take a
40ft. motor-boat within biscuit throw. Wild
goats browse on its precipitous face, and the
scene even by day is aboriginal and thrilling.
Once round the cape the water is quieter.
Under the lea outcrops of micaceous schist
run out into the sea, making numerous little
* coves primitive, exclusive and altogether in-
viting.
So thought Winnie, anyhow. W inme had
nothing on—either her mind or her body.
She stood on the verge of the sea in a little
bay. With tawny shingled hair, burnt shirt
body coppered to a new penny shade, and
eyes soft and trusting like a pretty-faced
kangaroo. A charming nude, a true study
of the nymph Australia facing the east.
Winnie took the water like a native. She
swam out beyond the outcrop with a flutter
of the legs and a slow overarm timing stroke.
A good swimmer in action is the poetry of
motion and Winnie was all that; slow
motion, with wonderful pace. Clearing the
outcrop she opened up a 40ft. motor-boat
anchored in a bay backed by cocoanut palms.
Seated on the foredeck, fishing, was a lazy-
looking man in pyjamas. This was brother
Joe. Joe looked older than he was. He
hadn’t shaved for a week and the four years
“over there” had taken toll.
Winnie had to coo-ee twice before lie heard
her. He waved a derisive pyjama leg and
covered his face with his hat. Winlnie
laughed bubblingly. An elderly man popped
up from the cabin and roared out something.
She wiggled her toes at him.
The day was blazing hot and she took
her time. Finally she turned and lazily
stroked her way to the beach, chopping at
the water with her mouth like a sportive
barramundi. Winnie shot up the beach on
her chest and lay there, her breathing slow
and deep. Rising, she shook her hair free
from the ocean dew and sauntered towards a
diminutive heap of clothing, a heap which
seemed more towel than apparel.
In that heat a few dabs with the towel
and then Winnie began to dress. She was
half-way through when swiftly round the
edge of rock stepped—what? An alligator?
Worse, much worse—a man !
A tall, taking young fellow in i>are feet,
slacks and singlet. In his hand an auto-
matic. He gave back a step, abashed for a
second, and stood pop-eyed.
Bang! Winnie heard the bullet hit him
before he staggered forward again. Then
“Run, girlie, run,” he gasped and turned
with gun ready.
Lots of girls would have stayed to help
that young man ; to staunch the blood trick-
ling down his chest. That is, fully clothed.
But half-dressed? No! Stark panic seized
Winnie. In two kangaroo hops she was
round the rock and in a second was flat out
—for the motor-boat. As she leapt the auto-
matic barked twice. Now Winnie was more
than a natural runner. She was an edu-
cated one. Joe had seen to that. The piston-
like movement of the arms co-ordinating with
the twinkling feet, she flitted like the sea
drift before a gale. Have you seen the paint-
ing of the winged Minerva, or, better still,
a Marathon runner in action? Every strike
he seems to be toppling on the face, but he
never does—till the finish.
The moment she turned the rock Joe be-
came master of ceremonies. As she neared
the point opposite the boat, “The bush, kid,”
he yelled and Winnie swerved and hit the
bracken in a flying dive.
A pause followed. But Dad wanted action.
Dad with the bald head and snaggle tooth.
He reached for Joe’s military rifle, swearing
horribly.
“I’m handling this, Dad,” said Joe fore-
stalling him. Joe’s four years “over there”
had been full of quick action. “All right,
Kiddo?” he called into the bush.
“Yes, Joe, all right. There’s a man shot
behind a rock.” This quaveringly.
“Steady, Win,” said Joe. “Let him rot,
kid. When I say ‘go,’ break for the water
and long dive in to the shelter of the launch.
Got your wind?”
“Yes, Joe.”
Joe sank into the well of the launch, and,
aiming at the outcrop, called softly: “Are
you ready, Kid? Get set. Go!” and he
opened brisk fire.
A flash of white out of the bracken, a hop,
step and a swish and Winnie broke water
alongside. Then Joe ceased fire.
“Stop swearing, Dad. Heave her in.”
All was silence from the beach. Win sat
in the cabin putting on a pair of Joe’s shorts
while she told the facts.
“He told you to run, did he?” queried Joe.
“Yes,” said Win. “Oh, Joe”
“And he’s got a blighty?”
“Yes, I saw”
“Well, we gotter get him in. Who’s pick-
ing on him, anyway? This isn’t France.”
Then Dad stood up and girded up his
pants. He was still rattled. He had been
holding Winnie close. He took an automatic
from the locker and detailed himself off as
ambulance bearer. He’d bring the bloke in
in spite of Hell and Henry and so .on.
Winnie covered her ears. Joe looked at
him admiringly. He was better than a whole
troopship. Where did Dad learn all that
hide-blistering stuff!
Suddenly Joe sank into the well, rifle
ready. A figure in bare feej, slacks and
singlet came round the outcrop. Swaying
somewhat he walked towards them, now and
then turning an anxious face backwards. Joe
immediately began chipping chunks of schist
off the rock he had left. Dad jumped for
the dingy and pushed off. The man came
a few steps further, then slipped to his
knees, the automatic pitching in the sand.
“No can do,” he called feebly.
“Coming,” snapped Dad.
No sign of the enemy. Joe ceased fire
as Dad pulled alongside. They hoisted the
wounded man in and sat him down.
“Blighty,” said he and rolled off the seat
into Winnie’s arms.
Afterwards in the bunk, his shoulder-
wound dressed by Joe, and with Winnie hold-
ing his head and administering brandy, he
came to. He blinked at Joe and looked up at
Winnie. Swallowing the bf andy obediently he
settled back on her arm. Joe eyed him coldly.
“Playing a lone hand, young fellow?”
The patient nodded. Then to Winnie.
“You all right, Bright Eyes?”
Winnie gently took away her arm.
“Yes,” briefly. She rose and went to her
Dad, who was on the watch.
“Blast yer,” Joe exclaimed irritably.
“What’s yer game?”
“Opium,” said the stranger.
Joe whistled long and low. He realised
the significance of the word. He had heard
that a man with small capital and the proper
connection, a man fond of excitement and
utterly unscrupulous, could buy a home at
Darling Point after a couple of years’ opera-
tion in North Queensland. A big risk with
big money. Better than rum-running. Cargo
less bulky. Chinese operators had been in
the game for years ; had inherited the trade
from their forefathers and had an extensive
clientele. Joe wondered. There might be a

few pickings for him on the side. As long
as Australians didn’t take to opium Joe
had few scruples. If Chows and Dagoes
wanted it
But Joe was cautious. He leaned for-
ward. “Say, Digger,” he whispered, “which
end are you at?”
“Revenue officer,” replied the stranger
bluntly.
Joe blinked. Darling Point and the flesh-
pots faded slowly out. The stranger, observ-
ing him, smiled.
“I’ve been watching this gang for a week,”
he said. “The stuff was dropped over from
the Woomera at night, I think. I don’t
know who got me. I glimpsed a cove stalk-
ing me among the rocks, but I’ve got nothing
on them. I suspect they land the stuff here,
and that ends their part.”
“Chug, chug,” came faintly on the breeze.
The wounded man raised himself as Dad
called out. “Motor-boat rounding the point.”
The revenue officer stared through the
port. “That’s the gang,” he said, and sank
back. “Watch your step, skipper.” This to Joe.
The motor-boat swung round the cape. A
tall, slim man was standing steering with
his foot. As they approached he waved his
hand nonchalantly to Joe and dropped anchor
about a hundred yards away.
“Cool,” muttered Joe.
The newcomer left his crew of three to
make all snug, and immediately climbed
aboard his flattie and pushed off. Joe made
all ready to receive him. He came alongside
with a flash of white teeth and a cheery
word. He was plainly a half-caste China-
man and handsome; handsome as only a half-
caste can be. Broad, low brow, aquiline
nose; big lustrous eyes, set well apart and
full of intelligence; a full mouth, but not
too full; an old-gold complexion with the
peach bloom in the cheeks which in the
whites is only found in these latitudes at
Herberton.
He looked up at Joe’s craggy features and
smiled.
“Get any?”
“No sabee,” grunted Joe.
The half-caste’s smile vanished. “I thought
I heard firing,” he answered in a low culti-
vated voice. “Was it an alligator?”
Again Joe grunted. “S’pose you go back
longa that fellow more better, eh?”
The half-caste’s eyes flashed. “I beg your
pardon,” he said coldly. “My name is Foo
Yek. Might I ask”
“You might,” cut in Joe crisply. This
shandygaff with the face of a movie actor
certainly had plenty of nerve.
“Oh, Miss Foo Yek!” exclaimed Winnie.
“Won’t you come aboard? You can’t blame
my brother for mistaking you, can you?”
sweetly. “Your disguise is admirable. Isn’t
it, Dad?”
Dad bristled as he realised the position.
His look was poison. Joe laughed. Taken
aback at first, he now gazed with amusement
at the beautiful face alongside. But an old
campaigner was Joe.
Miss Foo Yek smiled brightly at Winnie;
then, flashing a timid apologetic glance at
Joe, “Thank you, Miss —Carter, yes. Thank
you. But it isn’t a disguise really. It’s so
much more comfortable in a boat, don’t you
think?” She looked back at her own boat.
“And father says it’s really safer.”
“It suits you first rate, Miss Foo Yek,”
said Joe. He wondered how he could have
been deceived. “Come aboard, do.”
As she came aboard he watched her face
closely. She was really beautiful, from her
small feet up to her well-shaped head, which
was trimmed boy fashion.
Then she saw the man lying in th e cabin.
Instantly Joe got a glimpse of the tiger in
her. Her lips drew back and the eyes fairly
smoked.
The wounded man smiled up at her. “Hello,
Susie,” he greeted. “Only a shoulder-wound,
old girl. Your marksman was pretty nippy,
though.”
Susie Foo Yek recovered herself magnifi-
cently. She turned to Winnie.
“Your friend has the advantage of me,
Miss Carter.”
Not even knowing the patient’s name,
Winnie hesitated. Susie saw it and immedi-
ately turned to her flattie. Joe intervened.
“Just a moment, Miss Foo Yek. You
see”
Then from the cabin came musically: “If
you knew Susie like I know Susie”
With a bound the half-caste girl reached
her dingy. She stood for a moment.
“You dirty police pimp!” she hissed, all
the vileness of her white mother on the sur-
face. “But you’ve got nothing on me, blast
you! Look to yourself, you and she
trailed off into shrieking insults.
Winnie recoiled in horror. Joe smiled
widely. Dad lifted his automatic.
“Come back,” he snarled, all snaggle tooth.
“Bah,” sneered the girl and continued on
her way.
“And now what?” asked Joe.
Winnie suggested making for Innisfail and
a doctor, but the revenue officer vetoed this.
“I can wait,” ho said. “I’m comfortable
enough. We must get this gang with the
goods, and the goods are there.”
“Do you want the gang or the goods?”
queried Joe.
“I want both,” said the other.
“Well, you can’t have both,” snapped Joe.
“Not the girl at any rate.” He paused.
"She’s in wrong, but I’m a bit with her.
I’ll get you the £oods, but you’ll have to let
her go. It’s a bit risky, and Winnie has run
enough risks,” he added diplomatically.
“Winnie?” exclaimed the patient.
“Yes, she’ll have to help,” and Joe ex-
plained his plans.
When he had finished Winnie clapped her
hands in approval. The officer scowled.
“Rotten idea,” he growled. “Leave Miss
Winnie out. What do you carry between
your cars, anyway—a rubbish dump? Do
you want her knifed? That Susie woman
would slip a knife into her quick smart if
she got into a tantrum. The plan’s a dud.”
“You’re wounded worse than I thought,”
Joe grinned; whereat Winnie blushed furi-
ously. The wounded man turned his face to
the wall and earned her gratitude.
All the afternoon the two boats lay and
watched each other; and at dusk Joe and
Winnie got into the flattie and rowed to-
wards the opium runner.
As they drew near they were challenged by
Susie Foo Yek.
“Can we talk privately with you, Miss
Foo Yek,” called Joe.
“You can’t come aboard here,” she replied
curtly.
“On the beach, then?” urged Winnie.
At the sound of her voice Susie hesitated.
They heard her consulting the other three.
“All right,” she called presently. “On the
beach.”
“Will you come with us?”
“No. I’ll go with one of our crew.”
Dad saw them land, and presently Susie
Foo Yek joined them. She spoke a few
words to her oarsman, then approached Joe
and Winnie. The three walked up among
the cocoanut palms and disappeared over a
small rise. Dad grinned, he primed the
engine, turned her over and helped the
revenue officer to the tiller. Then, getting
his anchor straight up and down, he waited
expectantly.
From behind the ridge there came, crash-
ing on the ear, a woman’s nerve-sliattering
shriek. A second’s pause. Then a scream
shuddering across the water and ending
in a long-drawn sobbing moan of despair.
Even Dad, who had been expecting it, felt
his blood curdle. The officer gripped the tiller
On the smuggler the effect was galvanic.
The Chinaman in the boat bounded on to
the beach, and started for the palms. The
sand kicked up at his feet. Joe had opened
fire from the ridge. Another bullet hissed
past his head and halted him. With yells
and wild cursing the opium-runner turned
and bolted for the flattie. “Zip, zip,” in the
water told him he was still under fire, and
in frantic haste he paddled for the motor-
boat. Yabbering Cantonese filled the air as
he drew alongside.
His fellow-smugglers scrambled in, revol-
vers ready.
Dad pulled up his anchor. The Customs
officer brought her round, and as the China-
men drew clear headed straight for them.
Two were standing up facing the shore, but
the oarsman saw Dad’s military rifle bearing
down on them and yelled a warning. Bang!
and the Chinaman ducked and nearly went
overboard. One recovering, levelled his
revolver at the oncoming boat and instantly
another scream issued from the palms. The
Chinaman who had stopped rowing franti-
cally jerked at the oars, the marksman
tottered and the bullet went wide. Then
the motor-boat at top speed took them amid-
ships. One jumped for the bows, but Dad
kicked him in the face. Next minute three
spluttering Chinamen were swimming for the
shore.
Joe and Winnie strolled over the rise, and
got into their flattie. Dad took the helm
and brought the motor-boat alongside the
deserted opium-runner.
As Joe and Winnie scrambled aboard Dad
said: “Here you are, Joe—twenty-two tins,
Easy money, and our friend here will get a
bonus for the capture. Turn her over, Joe.”
“Yes,” replied Joe, “Innisfail has it. How
did you like Winnie’s screams, young feller?
Susie tried to knife me when I hugged her,
but I was waiting for just that. I backed
her against a palm and Winnie clapped
your bracelets on her round the tree. She’s
there now hugging the palm, backwards, and
trying to spit out the gag.”
Tiiey looked back at the fast receding

Information Sought.
How should pars, he written for The
Bulletin ? How long must one wait be-
fore submitting elsewhere? Are pars, re-
turned? In what manner is payment made?
—1874.
When typing pars, for The Bulletin,
treble space the lines, place pen-name at
the beginning and endorse each sheet with
name and address. Each item should be
typed or written on a separate sheet of
paper. Allow from a month to six weeks to
elapse before submitting elsewhere. Para-
graphs are not acknowledged, but every
effort is made to return them where stamps
are enclosed. As pars, frequently are re-
jected after they have been “subbed,” and
even when in type, no guarantee can be
given as to their return. Contributors are
expected to claim for payment. Clip out
par., paste on sheet of paper, state clearly at
side of each cutting the column, page and
date of issue, and post to accountant.
(1) I have a block of land on which I
have a share-farmer. Although an agree-
ment was drawn up, it was never signed. 1
have reason to believe that the share-farmer
has been disposing of some of the crop,
which was to be marketed in my name and,
by my direction. (2) In the event of either
party terminating the agreement, and certain
tools, etc., not being forthcoming, what re-
dress have If (3) Can I get an exami-
nation of his uatik account? (4) In event
of crop being disposed of, could I have him
arrested or would 1 have to proceed by
summons ?—l7ll.
(1) Assuming that you can establish the
unsigned contract, and the share-farmer has
been disposing of some of the crop contrary
to its provisions, you can sue for damages
consequent on the breach. (2) If the tools,
etc., should be detained after the termination
of the contract you could serve him with
notice to hand them over and, if not com-
plied with, you could then proceed against
him for illegal detention. (3) You arc not
entitled to examine his banking-account
unless provided for in the contract. (4)
Your remedy is by civil not by criminal
process.
How many soldiers did the United States
have in France at the time of the signing
of the Armistice ?■ —1780.
On November 20, 1918, Gen. Pershing,
after estimating losses, reported in France
1,338,168 combatant troops.
How can sneezing fits be avoided? —1733.
There are two ways of stopping a sneez-
ing bout. One is to squeeze the nostrils and
hold them firmly till the desire to sneeze
passes. The other is to pull the upper lip
down to the lower. If your nose is subject
to continued feelings of irritation, you had
better see your doctor.
/ have an orange-tree on which ihe fruit,
when about half ripe, splits. The tree is in
an easterly position and gets plenty of water
in the dry months? —1159.
Splitting of fruits on the orange is usually
due to an abundant supply of water following
on a dry or droughty period. In this case
the tree is probably suffering from exan-
thema, which is believed to be caused by lack
of organic matter in the soil. Ample sup-
plies of stable manure, if individual trees
are affected only, and growing green-manure
crops, if a large area is affected, is recom-
mended. If much “die-back” wood is present
a spraying with 3 3.50 Bordeaux mixture
with one of red oil, well emulsified, is bene-
ficial.
(1) What teas the date of publication of
the first edition of “Hard Times,” by Charles
Dickens? (2) What would be the value of
first editions of Dickens’s works? —1697.
(1) The first edition of “Hard Times”
was published in 1854 by Bradbury. Value
depends to a great exent upon condition.
Copies have been sold in London at Bs. to
40s. (2) Prices of the different volumes of
Dickens’s works vary considerably. There is
no fixed value, some titles being scarcer
than others.
Before coming to Australia, 18 months
ago, I resided in New Zealand for 20 years.
Can I remain away without being deban-red
from receiving the old-age pension? —l779.
To be eligible for an old-age pension in
New Zealand, applicants must be resident in
N.Z. and have resided continuously there for
the past 25 years. Continuous residence is
not interrupted by absence not exceeding two
years in the aggregate.
I want to place my son, aged five, in a
kindergarten, preferably in a Sydney seaside
suburb. Can you give me any information?
—1694.
The Kindergarten Union of N.S.W. sug-
gests Manly Grammar School, Ashburner-
road, Manly; and Brighton .College, Manly.
The former takes day pupils and boarders,
the latter day pupils and girl boarders only.
A man is paying alimony to his former
wife for herself and child. If the wife
marries again does he continue both pay-
ments? —1719.
If the former wife marries again the Court
may discharge the order with regard to the
payment of alimony. The procedure is by
way of petition to the Court. The mainte-
nance of the child still devolves on the father.
I have a kitchen article which can be
cheaply made. Can you give me infor-
mation as to patenting, manufacture and
sale? —1764.
Submit invention to reputable patent
attorney, and through him obtain provi-
sional protection for nine months at a cost
of £5 ss. Under cover of the protection
submit the article to a manufacturer for an
estimate of cost and opinion as to selling
value. If the latter is favorable, terms
could probably be arranged for manufacture
and marketing. The above is assuming that
the article is not already known and used,
as otherwise you could not obtain valid
patent protection. Griffith and Hassel, 77
Castlereagh-street, Sydney, or any other
patent attorney would advise on this point.
(1) I buy a house through an agent—
what fees am I liable for? (2) If bought on
time-payment is it safe to leave the deeds
with the original owner? (3) If he kept them
could he mortgage the house without my
knowledge and would I be liable for such a
mortgage? (4) If I get a solicitor to super-
vise the transaction, what fees must I pay
him? (5) How can I find out if there is a
mortgage on the property already? —l672.
(1) The vendor nays the agent's commis-
sion, not the purchaser. (2) You would not
be entitled to a certificate of title till the
payments had been completed. (3) To pre-
vent such a possibility you could lodge a
caveat with the Registrar-General, the effect
of which would be to entitle you to notice
of any legal transaction with regard to the
property. <4) The fees are fixed by scale
under the Conveyancing Act, 1919, and are
determined bv the value of the property.
(5) By making a search at the Lands Titles
Office. In view of all the detail as to
searches, nayment of rates, necessity for
survey and so on and the technical require-
ments of the lafr the wise course is to employ
a solicitor skilled in such matters.
What is the meaning of .22, .32, .25.20,
.32.40, etc., denoting the calibre of rifles? —
1607.
The calibre of a rifle or pistol barrel is
usually expressed in decimal fractions of the
inch in the case of English- and American-
made arras, and in millimetres and fractions
thereof by Continental manufacturers. Thus
.22 calibre means that the diameter of the
bore measures twenty-two-liundredths of an
inch ; .25 calibre, 25-100 or gin., and so on.
In the expressions .25-20, .32-20, 32-40, etc.,
the first figures indicate the nominal calibre,
and the second have reference to the weight
in grains of the charge of black powder
which was originally used as a propellent.
(1) Is a specified sum of money paid by
nurses at beginning of training? (2) Has
a nurse to buy her own uniforms, aprons
and caps? (3) Wages at beginning of train-
ing? (4) Melbourne hospitals available at
which to start a nursing career? (5) How
much money would « girl require to start
training ? —1624.
(1) No. (2) Not usually. (3) Varies
from £lB per annum. (4) A list of training-
schools may be obtained from the Registrar,
Nurses’ Board, 352 Collins-street, Melbourne.
(5) Would suggest £3O or £4O.
Is there any market for small sines of
mica ? —1843.
If the mica is of the right quality and free
of cracks and stains, sheet as small as 3in.
by 2in. is marketable, although the price,
according to quality, may be as low as Is. Od.
per lb. If you have any quantity and can
produce regularly, post representative sample
to Frank Ilambridge, 22 Bridge-street, Syd-
ney, and he will advise you.
Are bone ashes good for the garden?— l796.
Bone charcoal is of very small fertilising
value, as all the nitrogen and phosphoric acid
are lost by the burning. The ashes contain
50 per cent, or more phosphate lime, and
this, being organic, improves the texture of
the soil.
When a builder enters into a contract with
a client is it necessary to stamp such con-
tract? If so, what is the amount of stamp
duty in N. 8. Wales, and can stamp be
affixed by the parties? —lB2l.
Assuming it to be an ordinary building
contract, not under seal, it should be stamped
in order to be a legal document. The duty
is fixed by statute at Is., and an adhesive
duty-stamp is all that is required.
What is the origin of petroleum, what
makes it flow and what takes its place in the
well? —1626.
Petroleum is derived as a distillate from
the decomposition of organic remains in sedi-
mentary rocks. Plants of low orders and
fleshy parts of marine animals contri-
bute waxy, fatty, gelatinous or resinous
products, which may go to form petroleum
under suitable conditions. Latest research
work in California indicates that the asphal-
tic oils there are derived from diatoms and
other allied plants and the paraffin oils
from animal remains. Theories as to the
inorganic origin of petroleum are almost uni-
versally abandoned. Chemically they are
possible: geologically they are incompatible
with known facts. Gas pressure and hydro-
static pressure, roughly proportional to
depth, makes the petroleum flow. Water
takes the place of oil in the depleted well.
(1) A good place to learn wool-classing?
(2) Details of course? (3) Is it difficult to
obtain a position when qualified? (4) What
pay do wool-classers receive? (5) At 26 am
I too old to start?— l792.
(1) East Sydney Technical College, Dar-
linghurst. (2) Write to C. E. Cowley,
Lecturer-in-Charge, Sheep and Wool Dept.,
who will supply full particulars. (3) Most
of the larger stations have classers who are
engaged from year to year. The number of
classers turned out is in excess of the demand.
The work is intermittent, and to-day in the
height of the shearing season many classers
are looking for work. (4) Broadly, the pay
for wool-classers is £7 15s. per week when
the total number of sheep and lambs shorn
is under 8000, rising to £8 12s. (5) Twenty-
six years of age is hot too old to start class-
ing. But the occupation offers poor pro-
spects. The work in N.S.W. lasts only from
July to November. During the other por-
tion of the year work must be found in some
other occupation or in wool repacking estab-
lishments, where the rate of pay is not high.
As closer settlement advances the chance of
obtaining large sheds for classing diminishes.
(1) Where in Sydney can I learn china-
painting, pottery, wood-painting and cabinet-
making? (2) Is it better to have class or
private lessons? (3) Arc the arts taught in
Brisbane? (4) A refined and quiet place in
Sydney in which I could board and study? —
1858.
(1) China-painting and poker work are
taught by the Ceramic Art Studio, Bristol
House, 147 Elizabeth-street, Sydney. Sub-
jects cost £3 3s. each for 10 lessons. Mrs.
Hal Eyre, Mount-street, Coogee, and Misses
H. G. Hirst and Cahill, Strand Arcade, Syd-
ney, are teachers of pottery. Brooke Arm-
strong, Hallcarth, Walston-avenue, Turra-
murra, teaches cabinet-work. China-painting
and pottery is also taught at the Depart-
ment of Art, East Sydney Technical College,
Darlinghurst. Further particulars can be
obtained from each of the above by communi-
cating direct. (2) Private tuition is the
better, but the classes are small. (3) Try
the Arabian Art Saloon, Brisbane, or the
Queensland Department of Education (Tech-
nical Branch). (4) Largely a matter of
cost. But it should not be difficult to find
a suitable place.
Under what law can a trustee company
refuse to make good losses made by it on
foreclosed mortgages? —lB7B.
The general Common law principle is that
a trustee whether an individual or a company
must act in that office as a prudent man
would act in regard to his own property,
otherwise he will be liable if the property
proves deficient. Under the Statute law of
each State a list of the class of securities in
which a trustee may invest is provided. If
the trustee co. could be shown to have
exceeded its statutory powers or acted with
an imprudence that would not be shown by
a private person exercising a reasonable dis-
cretion it would be liable for its wrong-doing.
It would not, however, be liable for bona fide
losses incurred under a lawful exercise of its
powers.

Brief Answers.
C.H.: It’s a gamble; and, besides, it is
overloaded with preliminary exes 0.8.: It can be
made bankrupt only if it fails to pay its debts; it
can’t be made bankrupt for not paying you, a share-
holder, a dividend. If you own “about half the
shares” you ought to be able to exercise some
influence on the management, assuming that the
articles are not particularly rotten... .B.B.B.: Can’t
hear of any sale. That’s one bad feature of this
and similar cos. It’s much easier to get in than out.
. ...C.C.8.: Depends on the co.’s articles; but very
rarely do pref. shares participate in any way in new
issues, especially bonus issues... .D.S.: (1) The
titles seem to be all right, the facts re the suspen-
sion being as stated. (2) The law does not compel
the production of accounts that would be of any use
to you. (3) The people behind it are not influential,
and their chance of getting capital here is small —
unless a geophysical boom sets in. And that is
possible A.P.: Not listed. Hitherto finance has
been difficult, and the co. has been handicapped by
not being able to make cash payments; but its
operations are extensive and growing and its technical
reputation is very high. . . .P.1.A.: Hate to recom-
mend you to drop out, but it’s probably the best
thing to do. Almost all the co.’s capital has gone
in exes.; its only hope is to get some other concern
to take over its policies, and that may not be easy.
J.M.K.: The Mount Rennie outrage took place
on September 9, 1886. Nine youths were sentenced
to death and two 19 years old and two 17 years
old paid the extreme penalty... .H.F.T.: The Mar-
ella (Burns-Philp Line) leaves Sydney December 3,

Nothing like it in the World
With the completion of a four year development and
building programme, Hudson and Essex each present an
entirely new line of bodies and an entirely new chassis
that gives new meaning to motor-car performance.
The Super-Six principle, long held in check, is released
to its full capacity.
That required chassis specially designed to permit full
expression of its wider, more flexible and nimble power.
It meant greater roadability; and a driving and riding ease
not heretofore known. It meant a reliability and sturdiness
that would meet uninterrupted and sustained performance
at top speed for any period of time.
Riding That is Like Flying.
In both Hudson and Essex, you will note at once, and always
remember, an effortless ease in all performance, that can
never be confused with any other car. It is the exclusive
characteristic of the Super-Six principle. Power is so
smoothly delivered in all ranges of performance that you
are scarcely conscious of it. You take the lead at the
getaway, you dart in and around traffic, or you travel all
day at sustained high speed, with only the way you out-
distance others to tell your supremacy. There is no sense
of mechanical effort, no explosive lunge of power, either
in your flashing getaway or in any phase of this flexible
performance.
The bodies are of such variety and beauty as will satisfy
all demands for luxury and exclusiveness as well as comfort
and price advantage.

NOTIONS
fJnd er the Whip
An enormous crowd sqw Textile win the
50tli Caulfield Cup. He had taken the Too-
rak Handicap on the first day of the meet-
ing and had run a close second to Bunkie in
the Coongy Handicap on the second day;
nevertheless, the public would not have him,
and there was any amount of 20 to 1 avail-
able on the course. Royal Charter, who had
scored his fifth w.f.a. success in the Herbert
Power Stakes on the Wednesday, was a warm
favorite at 9 to 4 despite adverse reports;
for these there was justification, as the
sequel proved. Bunkie was second choice at
Bto 1; Devonshire, who looked particularly
well, touched 7 to 1 and receded to tens;
Finsbury was at 12 to 1, Bombard 14 to 1,
Tookarby 15 to 1, Star d’Or 16 to 1 and
Textile 20 to 1, Thracian and Cairncross
being also at that price. Valorem and Bard
of Avon were 25 to 1; there was little
inquiry for the others.
The field of 24—ordinary hahdicappers for
the most part—gave the starter a lot of
trouble. Valaisian and Thracian were the chief
annoyances, and when the machine lifted
Valaisian was left, though the start was
otherwise good. The favorite was one of the
first to break the line, and for a short dis-
tance he led from Spear Maiden, Affirm,
Bunkie, Devonshire, Thracian, David Gar-
rick, Valorem and Sun Morn. As they
turned out of the straight Affirm had charge,
and nine furlongs from home he was two
lengths clear of Spear Maiden, with Bunkie,
Valorem, Royal Charter, Imitator, Cairn-
cross, Devonshire, Thracian, Piastoon, Bard
of Avon and Star d’Or best of the others. At
the top of the hill Bunkie ran into second
place two lengths behind Affirm. Here
Royal Charter struck trouble and dropped
back a bit. Just before they reached the
home turn there was a cry of “Here comes
Royal Charter!’’ but he again met trouble
and faded out. Affirm looked to haVe the
race won as he turned into the straight from
Spear Maiden, Textile (who had got a run
on the rails), Bunkie. Valorem, Tookarby
and Sun Morn. He still had charge at the
distance, hut Textile, finishing in brilliant
style, passed him and went right away to
win by a length and three-quarters from
Affirm, who -was three lengths clear of Star
d’Or. That horse finished very fast after
having been lost in the ruck in the early
stages; the 33-to-l shot Sun Morn came
home strongly in fourth place. Valorem,
Devonshire, Bunkie and Cairncross did best
of the others, Royal Charter finishing among
the last four.
Royal Charter was in the vet’s hands on
Sunday, a foreleg having filled. His ex-
perienced trainer considered him fit to run,
so there is no reasonable complaint on that
score, but his downfall was a severe blow to
the public and a source of delight to the
ring. It was a rough race, and Textile
was one of the few that did not suffer. He
was very cleverly ridden by W. Scanlan, who
contrived to keep him on the rails nearly all
the way. A good-looking 6-year-old chestnut
horse by Green Seal —Bradford Lass, he is
owned by C. G. Brown and K. McLean, and
trained by E. J. O'Dwyer. With Bst. 31b. on his
back he covered the 12 furlongs in 2min.
which equalled Manfred’s time last
year. His 101 b. penalty will bring his Mel-
bourne Cup weight to Bst. 51b —not much for
a Toorak Handicap and Caulfield Cup
winner if he can go two miles. Of those
behind him Star d’Or gave most promise as
regards the Cup.
A high-priced colt in Salzach, by Saltash
out of Bairn’s dam Reap, who had run
second to Mollison at Flemington, was a
2-to-l favorite for the Gwyn Nursery, and
turned out just as good a thing as the
price indicated. Sneaking a nice run on the
rails, he got home by a length and a quarter
from Strogoff (5 to !)_, with Redrak (100
to 1) the same distance away. Cecil Godby
trains the promising youngster for F. F.
Robinson and R. E. H. Hope, and Duncan
had the mount.
Farrago and Pitoota were equal favorites,
at 4 to 1, for the Burwood Handicap for
three-year-olds. Both ran well, but the
Woorak filly Lonicera (8 to 1) proved too
good for them at the distance (nine fur-
longs) and the weights ; taking charge at
the home turn, she wasn’t troubled to win
by a length from Farrago, with Pitoota a
neck away. This Rizzio gelding of Ben
RACING REPORT.
“A seasoned performer in Johnnie Jones was lying handy.”
Chaffey’s travelled very fast in the straight.
He looks much better than he did in Sydney,
and a good handicap should come his way
presently. Daniels, who is riding very well
just now, was atop of Lonicera, whose time
was lmin. 54fsec. She looks a fair thing
for the Oaks.
Eric Connolly got back his Devonshire
losses, with a lot added, in the Windsor
Handicap, wherein his imported gelding
Quirk (7 to 1) ran right away from the
opposition at the finish. Highland (7 to 1)
and Cheosan (6 to 1), an unlucky pair, were
in the minor places; The Wensum, a 7-to-2
favorite, ‘ ran badly. Bartle, the Sydney
jockey, rode Quirk, who cut out the six
furlongs in lmin. 12fsec. Connolly has now
won with five of his English horses—Murillo,
Herilda, Faircroft, Mote and Quirk —and
his run of successes with them has by no
means ended.

Jimmy Pike seldom rides a double—
because of his weight he gets few oppor-
tunities —but he did at Randwick on Satur-
day. In the Flying Handicap he gave a
masterly display of horsemanship on Fuji
San (3 to 1), who had the steadier of lOst.
91b. and was indifferently served at the
start, and there were hearty cheers for
both rider and steed when the big bay re-
turned to the weighing-in enclosure. But
if White Fang (12 to 1) had got out a bit
early even Pike’s artistry would not have
sufficed. In a good battle for third place
Greenline (9 to 2) just beat Calmest and
Ariedon. Pike’s mount in the Club Welter
was Bravado (3 to 1), who, handled just as
cleverly, accounted for the consistent Bacagi
(8 to 1) and Royal Dighton (20 to 1),
which handsome fellow is evidently coming
back to form.
A promising bit of stuff in The Pied Piper
(4 to 1) won the Novice Handicap from a
big field. He is by Magpie—Thaisa, and be-
longed to the late J. J. Garvan; Percy
Miller races him now. It would have been
a rather sultry day for McShortodds if
Bravery (14 to 1) hadn’t bobbed up in the
City Tatt.’s Handicap, in which she beat
Lady Constance (8 to 1) by a couple of
lengths, and Pennvan (36 to 1) by another,
the favorite, Wedding Eve (4 to'l), being
out of it. The chestnut daughter of Valais
—Military Cross had disappointed in a race
at the A.J.C. Spring Meeting, and the
public did not fancy her, but the stable —
she is trained by D. Lewis for J. J. Leahy
—had a fair win. The tote returned
£7 Is. 6d. for 10s.; on a straightout machine,
even with the murderous 12* p.c. deduction,
the price would have been 26 8-10 to 1, or
nearly twice as much as the bagmen offered.
It’s a point which might be noted by the
new N.S.W. Government, and by Vic.’s
Hogan Ministry as well. Bravery, who was
ridden by W. Cook, ran the 10 furlongs
in 2min. 41sec., and had a bit in reserve.

“Leamington” : I met Doubting Thomasine
just before the hurdle race. She audibly
wondered how many of the starters were
tied up by the books, how many were dead
on the owners’ account and how many were
there to “deal it out to the others.” As the
field swept past the first time she loudly
named several steeds whose jockeys were
obviously “pullin’ their ’eads orf,” but her
most strident condemnation was reserved for
an animal in the rear division which. I
gathered, she had backed. “Look at ’im!”
she snarled. “Dead as mutton !” The bit-
terness of her remarks increased as he
dropped further back, but she quietened when
a sharp forward move carried him into third
place. Over the second last jump he was in
front; going further away, he looked a cer-
tain winner. Suddenly the horse slipped and
crashed sickeningly into the rails, knocking
a panel out; the jockey catapulted into the
air before falling beneath the hoofs of the
half-dozen maddened horses that were stum-
bling over his prostrate mount. There was
a moment of horrified silence; then above
the cries I heard her shrill voice: “I knoo
it! ’E didn’t want to win ! ’E did that on
purpose!”
❖ :Js i>: H*
“O.P.II.”: Pillars of the churches spent
an hour and a half last week endeavoring to
persuade Vic. Premier Hogan to abandon
the bill to legalise the tote, but he gave them
no encouragement. To show them that his
isn’t a one-man Government, he promised
Cabinet consideration, but emphasised the
point that lie needed more revenue badly
and that betting was a luxury that was
fairly taxable. The best way to levy on turf
wagering, he thought, was through the
machine which didn’t tout for wagers. The
same restrictions would be placed on women
and children against patronising the machine
as were applied in the case of McShortodds.
The Labor party, Hogan added, was free to
vote as it pleased. In other words, there
would be no party whip-cracking.

“Der Jong” : It is only quoting a classic
phrase to say that something new is always
coming out of Africa. A recent invention,
which ha’s been tried in Capetown, promises
to revolutionise methods of timekeeping on
racecourses, as at present practised. It is
a radio device, the recording instrument of
which is worked by an invisible ray from a
lamp in the judge’s box; this focuses a
point of light, one-fifth of an inch in dia-
meter, on a selenium cell fixed in the winning
post. The horse crossing the invisible ray
extinguishes the point of light, and the sen-
sitive selenium stops the timing clock at
once, which means in the infinitesimal frac-
tion of a second. The human factor, whether
with a stop-watch in hand or pressing a
button to start an electric timing device, has
been proved to be one-fifth of a second slow
in a mile race and as much as three-fifths
in a two-mile spin.

“.Tinker”: “Five, ten, fifteen, twenty and
two’s twenty-two. There you are,” said
Bruslier, counting the coins into the punter’s
upturned palm. The punter handed him
back a two-shilling piece. “She’s pretty
light, ain’t she?” he questioned. Brusher
carefully inspected the coin. “Yes, it’s a
crook one all right,” he replied, and replaced
it with another. As the punter was passing
the adjoining bookmaker’s stand the Tommy
beckoned him over. “I saw you dook
Brusher back that crook swei bob.” he
said. “He’s got eyes like chapel hatpegs,
but it got past him. It’s a wonder you hap-
pened to notice it.” “Why wouldn’t I?” the
punter replied, “w’en I put it in on him.
See you again.”

“Don Crew” : Add to “Throat Strap’s” list
of erstwhile Rajidwick Flat crooks (B.
13/10/’27) the monkey sweep man. He
began his job on the go-slow principle. When
the monkey drew the marble from the box
for the first sweep, everything was dinkum;
the speculator who had the corresponding
number handed in his ticket and was very
slowly paid. With excessive deliberation the
sweep man passed the marble round to show
that the game was fair. When drawing the
next sweep or two he was even slower than
before, and again would come the wearying
business of passing the marble round. “Hurry-
up,” a buttoner would yell, “you’re sending
us to sleep. We know everything’s O.K.—
get on with the business!” Thus admonished,
the sweep man would speed up. Disposing
of the tickets rapidly, he’d snatch the
marble from the monkey and call out
a number that corresponded with the number
on the buttoner’s ticket. No passing tho
marble round that time. Into the box it
would swiftly go, for it wasn’t the blit-
toner’s number.

“The local settling with regard to the Caulfield
Cup was all in favor of the bookmakers, who said
that for them the result was a ‘good one,’ and they
would now be able to operate on a more extended
scale on the Melbourne Cup.”—S. M. Herald.
Are you listening, students of form and
appraisers of chances
And followers of tips and of fancies,
You punters, all classes and species and
grades and descriptions?
The bags of the bookies have ne’er so
alluringly beckoned,
They’re bursting with boodle, it’s reckoned,
So this, it’s abundantly clear, is the time of
the year
To spoil the Egyptians.
The Caulfield, with favorites nowhere and
Textile the winner,
Provided the tribe with a skinner.
Had it gone to a nag that they’d written pro-
fusely in doubles,
There’d be gloom, apprehensiveness, too, it
may be, in the faces
Of the chaps who lay odds at the races.
Now the bigger the crowd roundabout the
louder they’ll shout.
Their blankety troubles!
They are armed cap-a-pie for the fray, the
quotation-purveyors;
The fat on their ribs is in layers ;
They openly tell of their gains to reporters
who “chat” them.
There are grins on their dials like the smile
of a goat in a garden,
And they needn’t cramp prices or harden
Their hearts when some extra good thing is
breathed round the ring.
Up, punters, and at them!

The Mark of Superior Quality
RAY-O-LITE ELECTRIC TORCHES
Give dependable light — When you use Ray-O-Lite Electric Torches, you are sure of light.
Q/ii/>t\) nt rii/rhf They have so many advantages, so many unique features of construc-
! y » tion that they must give unusual service under all conditions.
There is the octagon head, which prevents rolling when torches are laid down. Then there
** is the highest grade vulcanized tube case corrugated for easy handling, and which will support
several hundred pounds without breaking. A patented locking switch, found only on Ray-
O-Lites, prevents accidental discharge of battery. Breakage of lamps is
avoided by the “shock-absorber” action of the switch.
And yet —they cost no more. Ask for a Ray-O-Lite at
your dealers, and see these advantages
for vourself.

ELECTRIC TORCH BATTERIES
In Ray-O-Lite Electric Torches, use only Ray-O-Vac Torch Batteries. They have longer
life, give brighter light and have more sustained power. Carefully made, and critically in-
spected, they will give you the dependable power that makes so sure the continuous
operation of Ray-O-Lite Electric Torches.
RAY-D-VAC
RADIO “B” BATTERIES
Give clearer reception and longer life
To get really undistorted signals in your radio set, use Ray-O-Vac "B”
Batteries. They're specially designed to overcome resistance within the “B”
power unit, which is the cause of distortion. Ray-O-Vacs have only from %
to Yz the internal resistance produced in other batteries. You will be sur-
prised at the clarity of tone, and the natural reproduction
of the signals.
With this excellence of reproduction you get long life, and full
use of all the current in the battery. Ray-O-Vac engineers have
designed a new type of construction that eliminates most of the
life-shortening troubles found in other kinds. Each cell is in a
water-proofed carton, insulated from all other cells so that the
electrolyte can expand and give its full energy. No hot pitch is
poured into the battery to rob the cells of energy. This feature
alone gives 10% to 15% longer life.
Ray-O-Vac “B” Batteries have increased tremendously in
popular favor, because they give really good service. Try them
in your radio-set.
Ray-O-Vac and Ray-O-Lite are truly the marks of superior
service. If your dealer cannot supply you, write to our distri-
butor, named below, who will gladly advise you of the address
of the nearest source of supply.

M.Q. (and Rafferty) Rules
Maorilander Lachie McDonald (list. S^lb.),
who made his Australian debut at the
Sydney Stadium on Friday night, became a
favorite at once. Any man who can box a
draw with Billy Harms (list. 211b.) must
be a good man, for Harms is a snappy
puncher and a cool and resourceful fellow,
as Sydney well knows. McDonald did not
allow Billy to take the lead early, as he
usually has done; but assumed the role of
attacker himself. He found the S’African
willing and they fairly “ate” boxing gloves in
every round. So fast was the pace and so
hard the hitting that there were few in the
crowd who did not expect a knockout at
any moment during the first seven rounds.
Then it became obvious that both were
gluttons for punishment and everybody sat
back to watch a splendid demonstration of
skill and endurance. No amount of furious
punching appeared to damp the ardor of
either man, and when at the end of the loth
round referee Wallis placed a hand on both
heads the cheering was spontaneous. For
five minutes it rained silver into the ring.
On the same night, at Leichhardt, Billy
McAlister (8st. 61b.) gave Micky Walker
(8st. 61b.) a thorough hiding for 15 rounds.
There was a full house at Leichhardt, which
is having much the better of its argument
with Rushcutter Bay.
* * * *
“Mitt-Shover”: Following on the lead
given by the Americans, and all too belatedly
followed in Australia, the National Sport-
ing Club, which practically controls British
boxing, has resolved to shorten championship
contests fropi 20 to 15 rounds. The reason
given for the change is that the British
boxer has been severely handicapped in hav-
ing to go up against the fast-moving Ameri-
cans, trained and coached to force a decision,
one way or the other, in 15 or 10 rounds.
The question of humanity to the pug. might
also enter into the question. The Americans
have now got down to 10-round bouts for
their big events, as wutness the Tunny-
Dempsey engagement. It will have to come
to that in Australia and Britain before
long. The spectator who isn’t satisfied with
10 rounds of real stoush ought to spend
his leisure hours in the abattoirs, and not in
a boxing hall.
* * * *
“Mitt Shover”: There is devastating
pathos in the story of Jack Dempsey’s return
to the arms of his wife—a moving-picture
actress —after his defeat by Tunney. The
lady had heard by radio that Tunney had
been knocked out, and greeted her spouse as
a victorious warrior. Poor Jack had to
break the news to her that he had brought
home a pitiful 60,000 quid instead of
nearly half a million; and anyone who
has suffered from matrimony will sympa-
A NON-STARTER.
FLATITE (to stout ditto) : “Doin’ anythin’
over the ’urdles to-day, dear?”
tliise with him. However, the lady seems to
have taken the news as a lady ought. Which
leads one to the conclusion that, if Jack was
unlucky in losing to Tunney, nothing slipped
when he w r as picking his missus. Many an
Old Dutch, in similar cii'cumstances, would
have handed him a father of a hiding to add
to that which he had already received from
Gene the Marine.
* * * *
There were something like 14,000 cus-
tomers at Melbourne Exhibition when Ad.
Santel (13st. lib.) and George Zarynoff
(13st. 21b.) met under the management of
J. R. Brennan, and they were not dis-
appointed. Zarynoff gave a spectacular dis-
play of spinning and diving out of tight
corners, his leg work being an outstanding-
feature. But Santel was his master; in the
seventh round Ad. gained the only fall of
the night with a rattling armbar and body
press. It was wrestling of a high order,
and the crowd did not once clamor for
Rafferty rules. Bill Lang, former heavy-
weight champion, referred the preliminary
bouts of boxing, which were spirited if not
exactly memorable.
* * * *
“Bumpkin”: When asked why lie hadn’t
disqualified the parties to a particularly
savage wrestling match in Melbourne, the
referee said he had received so many letters
entreating him to let them proceed, no matter
what they did, that he felt it his duty not
to intervene. The motive seems sound, and
the following news items may be expected to
occur: —
A pedestrian who successfully evaded a motorist
at the Collins-Flinders streets intersection on Monday
afternoon was ordered by the traffic policeman to
make another run. This time the motorist won.
The constable explained afterwards that the crowd
obviously expected it.
By special request, Mr. Bill Sikes will repeat
his murderous assault of the 21st in Spadger’s-lane,
as soon as the victim has sufficiently recovered to
admit of being moved.
Owing to repeated encores, a second referee was
thrown to the mob at the Collingcray-Footswood
match on Saturday. He was not seen again.
The Ins and Outs
“Second-slip” : The N.S.W. selectors have
picked 29 players to practise for the match
against the returning M.L. team on October
28. Eight of the batch —Macartney, Old-
field, Andrews, Mailey, Bardsley, Everett,
Taylor and Gregory—were in the last Aus-
tralian XI. Macartney and Johnny Taylor
(who is ill) are not likely to play; Jack-
son, Kippax, Morgan, McNamee and Pratt
(North Sydney) or Fisher (Balmain), with
six of Collins’s men, will perhaps make up
the team. Collins himself wil( return to club
cricket presently; he is ambitious of cap-
taining Australia again next season.
* * * *
“Tuart”: The Melbourne C. G. is to be
the scene of an Australia v. The Rest match
this season; the profits will go to J. V.
Saunders, famous left-hand bowler of other
days. Saunders was a delicate chap and did
not last long in first-class cricket, but he
covered himself with glory on his one visit to
England in 1902, when he took 127 wickets
at 17.07. That was surely the greatest of
all the Australian teams. The bowlers, in
addition to Saunders, were Trumble (140 at
14.27), Jones and Howell; the batsmen were
Trumper (2570, av. 48.49), Hill, Duff, Darling
and Sid Gregory ; the all-rounders were Noble,
Armstrong and Hopkins; and Jim Kelly
kept wickets, with Carter as substitute.
When will Australia look upon the like of
that side again?
“Tenth Slip”: Perhaps Jack Saunders's
greatest feat was the bowling of F. W.
Tate, father of Maurice, in the famous game
at Old Trafford. which Australia won by
three runs. Tate, last man in, had to face
Saunders, and after snicking a lucky four
was clean bowled. Saunders took 7 for 150
in that match.
* * * *
There was a fair amount of heavy scoring
in Sydney grade cricket on Saturday, includ-
ing a dashing 178 by Macartney for Gordon
against Cumberland, though the little cham-
pion had a bit of luck in being dropped
when only 36. Don Bradman, now with St.
George, punched the ball hard for 130 n.o.
at the expense of Paddington, whose slow
bowlers he treated very cavalierly. Tin?
Rowral lad will play himself into the N.S.W.
XI before the end of the year. Wil-
liams raised the even three figures for North-
ern District against Petersham, for whom
Everett, who is shaping very well, took 5
for 92. Withers, who is in the colt class,
played a meritorious knock for Mosman, 131
in a total of 306. Bowlers were not helpless,
either, for in addition to Everett, Mailey
took 5 Western Suburbs wickets for
99 for Balmain, in spite of execrable catch-
ing. Rubb. of Manly, with 4 Glebe wickets
for 36; McNamee, the Randwick crack, 4
for 40 against Marrickville; and Pratt, of
North Sydney, 6 for 47 against Mosman,
were others who collected good bags.
* * * *
“H. L. Collins, the Australian cricket captain,
appeared as a bookmaker at Ascot (Sydney) pony
races last week.”
Time was when bowlers, medium and swift
And slow', impartially he blocked or biffed;
Now ’tis the punter to the fence he’ll lift,
As one might phrase it.
Time was he led, in Test and Sheffield Shield,
With tight-shut mouth (except when he
appealed).
But in those days he used to place the field,
And now he lays it.
Pipakds.
* ❖ ❖ *
“Hotham”: W. M. Woodfull is evidently
going to have another good season with the
bat. Playing for Carlton against Colling-
wood on Saturday he collected 12S n.o.
Others w T ho hoisted the three figures were
Vernon Ransford, who took 110 n.o. for
Melbourne v. Hawthorn, and Carl Willis, of
A.I.F. fame, who nicked the 100 for Prah-
ran against St. Kilda.
Racquet and Bawl
“Baseline”: The itinerary of the French
tennis players has at length been settled.
The Frenchmen will arrive in Sydney on
January 24, after a sojourn of three days in
Maoriland, where they w r ill meet the local
cracks. Their first appearance in Australia
will be in the Commonwealth championships,
which begin on January 28. That will not
give them much time to find their land legs,
but they should have nothing to complain of
on that score by the time the first match
against Australia is played in Melbourne.
Though Cochet and Lacoste are not coming,
Borotra and Brugnon are their country’s
representatives in doubles, and each has
defeated J". O. Anderson.
=:=***
“Net Ball”: Boussus, the third member of
the French team, is only 18. Young as he
is, he was one of the French representatives
at Wimbledon this year; there he was
beaten in the singles by Tilden. At an
earlier date his colors were lowered by the
A NEW SPECIES.
NEWCHUM: “I say, boy, are there any fish to be caught
here?"
BOY: “Cripes, mister, you’ll only catch snags there!”
NEWCHUM: “Snags? What’s wrong with them? Aren’t
they eatable?”
South African Raymond in Paris. The lad's
meeting with Crawford and Hopman should
be full of interest. Incidentally, his presence
in the team, instead of that of Lacoste or
Cochet, has led to a reduction of the “mini-
mum” and “maximum” guarantees for
expenses. The minimum originally asked
was £2OOO, and the maximum £4000.. These
figures have been reduced by £SOO in each
case.
* * * *
“Associate”: The Australian women’s
tennis team is to leave Melbourne on March
3. After a month in S. Africa the party
goes on to England and the Continent, and
America will be visited. As in 1025, a lady
manager is being sought who is willing to
pay her own expenses. How magnanimous
of the tennis heads!
❖ * * *
“Top Spin”: Friday and Saturday next
will see the re-commencement of the .“big”
tennis season in Sydney, with a series of
exhibition games at the Rushcutter Bay
courts. .T. O. Anderson will take part in
these, and the two crack N.S.W. youngsters,
Jack Crawford and Harry Hopman, will
also appear in the tourney, with O’Hara
Wood from Victoria. All the other first-
class N.S.W. players will be in action, and
the tournament should serve as a useful
practice gallop for the inter-SLate matches
between N.S.W. and Victoria, which are
billed to take place in Melbourne in
November.
Car and Cycle
“0.H.V.”: Motor-cycle racing in Sydney,
as in other parts of Australia, is becoming
less of a gamble and more of a sporting
proposition. On such tracks as the Speed-
way Royal lately no machine of over 34
h.p. has been eligible to compete; most com-
petitors favor the single-cylinder 2|-h.p.
machine brought to such perfection for rac-
ing purposes by both English and American
makers —though the Englishmen did most of
the pioneering. The speed attained is only a
very few miles an hour less than can be
got out of the big twins or 4-cyl. machines,
and in the lower-powered classes, owing to
the reliability of the single-cylinder principle,
there is less risk of mechanical breakdown.
There used to be a rule, which was a fair
one, that a competitor in any event had to
use the same machine in heats and finals.
That rule has been dropped at the Speed-
way Royal, and there’s a row over it. Enter-
prising American corporations that back up
their riders with corps of mechanics and
show-rooms full of two-wheelers get a big
pull over riders of machines who have
no such organisation behind them, and the
lads who bestride the mavericks think some-
thing ought to be added to their handicaps.
* * * *
“Vulcan”: Following on the passage
through Australia of Malins and Oliver on
their world’s motor-cycle tour, we are threat-
ened with another invasion of the same sort.
The adventurers are Lieut. (Handheld and
Flight-sergeant Sparkes, of the Royal Air
Force; they propose to do the trip by cycle
and • side-car. Their predecessors jumped
from Asia to Australia via steamer from
Calcutta. Glandfield and Sparkes propose
to go round via Singapore and Batavia, rid-
ing wherever possible, and then ferrying
from Sourabaya to Darwin.
Thence they will cross the
continent via Adelaide and
Melbourne to Sydney. As
the whole round trip is to
be done in 120 days, there
will be little time to spare
on the road for repairs or
punctures.
* * *
“Ball Race” : Two of Aus-
tralia’s leading amateur
cyclists, J. Standen, the
mile champion, and “Fatty”
Lamb, one of the world’s
best over a distance, have
been suspended by the Inter-
national Cyclists’ Union,
which has its headquarters
in Paris. Both men are
practically certainties for
selection as Olympic repre-
sentatives, but will be un-
able to ride at Amsterdam
unless the ban is lifted.
They were reported, curi-
ously enough, by the body in
control of professional
cycling; they are alleged to
have broken the rules of
amateurism by taking part
in a Sydney meeting at
which there was a match
between professionals. Lamb
and Standen rode with the
consent of the amateur asso-
ciation, but the pros, had
omitted to get the sanction
of tlicir governing body,
whose action seems a thou-
sand miles away from any
spirit of sportmanship. Per-
haps when Paris learns that
the N.S.W. cycling heads
approved of what the two
lads did tlieir suspension will be raised, for
much is left to local rulings and custom in
sucli cases. The whole thing, however, is one
more instance of the continuous bickering
brought about by the present nebulous defini-
tion of what constitutes amateur and profes-
sional status.
* * * *
“Hotliam”: R. W. Lamb won the road
test for Victorian cyclists ambitious of repre-
senting their State in the Olympic trial at
Sydney next month; lie traversed 126 miles
of middling to good highways in 6hr. 14min.
43sec. Lamb finished 24min. 4sec. ahead
of the second man, W. McLaughlin, but the
latter had to complete the journey on a flat
tire, having punctured three miles from the
finishing point.
* * * *
“Spare Tart” ; At the big motor show at
Olympia, London, Britain has exhibited 45
models, France 21, America 17, Italy 8
and Belgium 3. For the first time since
the war, Germany has a couple of exhibits.
According to one account of the show, Aus-
tralia, Maoriland and South Africa have
taken 15 million pounds’ worth of British
cars this year, though three years ago these
markets were almost wholly given over to
American cars.
The Nineteenth Hole
“E.K.”; Anything can happen at golf.
The hole is never won or lost until the
balls are holed out. Basil Purbrick, of
Woodlands (Vic.), was playing in a four-
ball match. Disaster befell his opponents at
the long seventeenth; they had played five
while he, 20 yards from the green, had
played two. But Basil’s third shot travelled
fully two feet, and his fourth ten yards—
into a bunker. It took him seven shots to
reach the green, and he lost the hole and
the two balls on the match, to a seven
scored by his opponents.

The Nineteenth Hole
“Colonel Damurize”: As readers may re-
member, I recently made a vow to abstain
from playing with associate-members of the
club. I broke my resolution in favor of Mrs.
McHr.ggis, whose husband is manager of the
bank where I keep my overdraft, such as it
is. I had a rotten round, and lost my ball
in the rough at the drive-off from the seven-
teenth. I always keep spare balls in the
bottom of the bag, whence it isn’t so easy
for the caddies to purloin them. When I
turned the bag upside down to get a new
ball to drop there were none there. “Nev-er-er
mind ye,” said Mrs. Mctlaggis genially;
“tak’ yin o’ mine”—and she tossed me a
used ball. I played a lovely pitch right on
to the green, and, believe me or not, the
dashed thing broke in two, half lying on
each side of the hole. When I had a look
at it, I found it had been broken before and
mended with strips of sticking-plaster. I
wouldn’t have minded that so much, but, as
I was moving off to the nineteenth, Mrs.
McHaggis caught me by the sleeve. “Min'
ye,” she said, “yon’s half a croon ye’re
owin’ me for the auld ba’.”
* * :J: :j;
“Ploughman”: Another frightful tragedy
in connection with the rules pf golf is
reported from Scotland. It happened at St.
Andrew’s, too. The 17tli hole at St. Andrew's
is crossed by a public road. One player
grounded his club in a heap of road metal
on this spot while trying to get the ball out.
He came in eventually with a card of 79, as
against his opponent’s 80. The question im-
mediately arose whether he should not be
penalised two strokes for grounding his club.
After a protracted sitting, the committee
ruled that the heap of stones constituted a
back bunk r, and that, therefore, grounding
of the club was permissible without forfei-
ture of strokes. So another leading case in
golf has been added to the multitude already
existing. When is a heap of road metal
nothing of the sort? Why, when it is a back
bunker, of course.
* * :S *
“Slow Back”: It is curious to note the
changes that are coming over golf. The old
school laid immense stress on stance and
swing, and if there was one thing more than
another that it taught it was the import-
ance of the variation of the swing. But the
American school, which seems to have pro-
duced a higher all-round standard of golf
than any other country, has banished the
swing variation ; it insists that every stroke
with every club —save the putter, perhaps—
should be played with the same type of
swing. And there is the rule, common to all
ball games: “Keep your eye on the ball.”
Australian Tommy Howard is threatening
even that. Ills idea is that a putter should
keep his eye on the hole. Howard’s theory
has captured many golfing imaginations in
Europe and America, and the legion of his
apostles is increasing daily.
* * * *
“Baillie”: One of the things they do
better in Britain is municipal golf. Some
advertising matter received from the little
watering-place of Troon, on the West Coast
of Scotland, shows that, with a population
of 40,000 or so, it keeps three municipal
golf links going, and makes a fine profit out
of them at very reasonable charges. No. 1
is 18 holes and covers 5936 yards ; the second
is also a 19-holer, but is 3198 out and about
the same distance in; the third goes 3905
yards in all—it is reserved for people who
have no time to play the longer rounds. In
Sydney wp have one golf course, outside the
private clubs, to serve a population of a mil-
lion. The single course pays hand over fist,
but is hideously congested. There is any
number of convenient sites for additional
links within easy reach of the city, but
beyond discussing the construction of a
course away out at National Park the City
Council has remained utterly indifferent to
a really good revenue-producing proposition,
with quite a lot of possibilities in the way
of jobs for its friends.
Miscellaneous
“Whiz”: Dog-racing (B. 6/10/’27) is not
coursing. Although every facility for escape
is afforded the hare (they cost 10s. a head
in Sydney and Melbourne), the object of
enclosure-coursing is to catch the animal, and
points are awarded to the greyhound doing
most to that end. I have seen a dog lead up
by 10 lengths and yet lose the course because
his opponent, a close-working tyke, after-
wards “sat on puss’s tail” —tha’t is, con-
tributed most towards the ultimate kill. This
is. vastly different from following an electric
flier which can never be grabbed. The
whippet strains after his owner, who waves
a handkerchief. No one ever called that
coursing. But it has more right to the
title than the racing of a»bunch of deluded
dogs after a metal quarry they are not to
catch. The whippet at least “caught” his
owner.
* * * *
“Bootle”: Under the shelter of that kindly
English law which enables a proprietor of
land to keep any unwanted person off his
demesne, people with a decent-sized stretch
of open country are now holding dog-racing
events without leave or license. A small
fee is charged for permission to trespass, and
a course is marked out. A dead hare is
mounted on a trolly and a wire is attached;
the other end of the wire is fastened to a
winding-wheel mounted on a motor lorry’s
back axle. When all is ready the clutch is
shoved in and the noble sport proceeds. The
dogs, on whose utter lack of a sense of
humor the whole game hinges, seem just as
willing to chivvy the hare as on properly
licensed and otherwise sanctified courses. So
the day seems at hand when everyone with
a Lizzie, a backyard, a couple of greyhounds
and a “rabbo” from the itinerant dealer, can
set up as a coursing entrepreneur, without
even the formality of requesting the coun-
tenance of Mr. Mark Gosling.
* * * *
The Waratahs are proving no less success-
ful in Scotland than in Wales and England.
Their first game in the Land o’ Cakes was
against Glasgow, which fielded six inter-
nationals. Scottish forwards are famous for
their solid rucking, but the visitors proved
themselves the better side in all departments,
winning a hard game by 10—-two tries and
two goals—to nil. With the appearance of
Malcolm, the Newcastle (N.S.W.) scrum-
half, in this game, every member of the
Waratahs has now been given a gallop. The
Saturday game was against a South of Scot-
land side; the latter, evidently suffering from
lack of teamwork, was beaten 30 to nil.
* * * *
“Shrewsbury”: The Waratahs will meet
at least one old friend when they go up
against the London Scottish side. G. Aitken,
the Maoriland Rhodes scholar, who was first
seen in Sydney with the M.L. Uni. XV
five years or so ago, is skipper of the exiled
Scots for this season. After that visit to
Australia Aitken captained the All Blacks
against the Springboks; he then went to
Oxford, where he gained his “blue,” and pre-
sently he was capped for Scotland. The
Oxford three-quarter line of that day, which
included lan Macpherson, Aitken and Johnny
Wallace, now captain of the Waratahs, is
reckoned the hnest that has ever appeared
for the Dark Blues. It was lifted, entire,
into the Scottish international side.
* * * *
Though King’s School, Parramatta, won
the G.P.S. sports at Sydney Cricket Ground
on Saturday, with a total of 52-?. points as
against 50 by St. Joseph’s, “Joey’s” was
represented by the outstanding athlete in
38-year-old Jim Carlton. The crack G.P.S.
three-quarter led off by winning the 220
yards in 21 4-ssec., equalling Nigel Barker's
N.S.W. record, which has stood for 22
years, and only a fifth of a second worse
than Norman Grelian’s Australasian figures
at Brisbane in 1923. Carlton followed this
up by winning the 100 in lOsec. dead ; then
he took the- 440 yards in 50 4-ssec. Not
content with these feats, he was permitted to
turn out in the shot putt and broad jump—
too heavy a task for a youngster to be
allowed to essay in one day. Wansey, of
HUBERT OPPERMAN, the Victorian
cyclist, who broke three world’s records
for the push bike in his 24-hour ride
from Mount Gambier to Melbourne.
King’s, won the half-mile in 2min. 5 2-ssec.,
but was beaten in the mile by Dufficy,
another St. Joseph’s boy, in 4min. 54sec.
Oowper, of Newington, annexed the 120
yards hurdles in 16 2-ssec., and did a good
broad jump to win with 21ft. 94in., Carlton
being second with 21ft. lin. Carlton’s im-
provement during the past few months has
been remarkable. If he can come on at the
same rate during the next few months, the
Olympic sprints will not be eut-and-dried
pi’opositions for the Americans.
“Bouragi” ; To aid in the choice of a team
for Amsterdam Australian National Games,
the first of their kind, are to be held in
Sydney three months hence. The Olympic
authorities have accepted Manly’s offer of
the use of the local oval and baths; the
boxing and wrestling will take place at the
Stadium and the cycling trials at the Sports
Ground. The Olympic programme will be
followed as far as may be possible, and it is
hoped that every State will send athletes.
The final selection of the team for Holland
will be made soon after the close of the
Games.
BOB PEARCE, the young New South
Welshman who is Australia’s champion
amateur sculler, and will very likely be
this country’s representative in the
sculling event at the Olympic Games.
“Blade Sight”: The 1927 King’s Prize,
shot for last week on the Anzac range, near
Liverpool (N.S.W.), was won by R. Gunn,
a Victorian, with a total of 339. Another
Cabbage Gardener in S. E. Ellis was second,
a point behind; third place was filled by a
Maorilander, Captain Masefield, with 337.
Visibility was very bad at the last range,
900 yards, and a gusty wind made matters
worse; the finishing marksmen were, con-
sequently, all over the target. Gunn’s best
shoot was at 800yds., where he nicked nine
bulls, dropping a point on his ninth shot
and finishing with a score of 49. The Com-
monwealth match was won by N.S.W.. with
the record total of 1781 points; Victoria
(1769) was second.
* * *
“Blade Sight”: There is to be an Aus-
tralian rifle team at Bisley next year; it
will consist of three representatives each
from N.S.W. and Victoria, two each from
Queensland, Westralia and South Aus., and
one from Tassy., Each State is to nominate
its men, and the Commonwealth council will
make the final selection. Much will depend
on whether the English N.R.A. decides to
reduce the size of the bull's-eyes. If this
is done and timely notification is given,
candidates for the trip might do worse than
start practice on the new sizes.
❖ ❖ sj:
“Pot th’ White” : Newman and Smith, who
claim the billiards championship, are facing
one another with drawn cues, so to speak.
They met the other day at Thurston’s Hall,
in London, where these things are settled,
and instead of arriving at the obvious
arrangement, “You beat me and I beat
you,” they quarrelled “violently”—to use
the cabled phrase. So negotiations have
lapsed. The idea of playing a game of bil-
liards straight off to decide the burning ques-
tion of superiority was, of course, not con-
sidered for a moment. That sort of thing
isn’t done in professional nastimes.
❖ ❖ ❖ v
“Bow”: The next inter-State eight-oar
race is to be rowed in N.S.W. in 1928
between April 15 and May 15. Hitherto the
event has been held on the Parramatta
River, but the N.S.W.R.A. is seriously
considering transferring the thing to the
quiet inland waters of the Nepean. If
this is done there should be a great deal
more public interest than was shown in
1922, when the race was last rowed in
Sydney. Whereas on the Parramatta course
the general body of spectators sees only the
beginning, middle or end of a race, according
to the position taken up, on the Nepean
there is an uninterrupted view of the whole
struggle for the people lining the sloping
banks of the long straight course. There
may be a slight loss of revenue till the new
course gets popularised. The risk is worth
taking, and the gain to the sport in the
end is likely to justify the experiment.
Business, Robbery., etc.
“Seebee”: Assured that there will be at
least one bid of £40,000, the Vic. Government
has decided to allow the Immigration
Bureau building, Russell-street, Melb., to
be submitted again at auction. The upset
price when the building was previously
offered was £50,000, and there was no bid.
If sold at £40,000, which is to be the reserve,
the Government will make a good profit. It
bought the place from the Herald for
£20,000 about five years ago, and spent
£3OOO on improvements and fittings. The
fittings are not included in the sale.

“M.G.S.”: The prices paid for its Sargents
by the Felton Bequest give a good idea of
how sadly that fund is being fooled by
European art-dealers. In 1012 “On the
Simplon in Autumn” and "Grand Canal.
Venice,” were purchased for £3O apiece.
“Study in the Alps” cost £lOO in 1913. In
1914 £2lO was paid for some “Autumn
Leaves.” The recently-obtained “At Miami,”
a trifling sketch and easily the worst yet
obtained, rau off with £430. Yet the Gallery
hasn't a really representative work by the
Anglo-American, although, when his execu-
tors realised his estate a few years ago,
some of his finest portraits went for less than
was paid for this latest acquisition.
i'fi * * *
“0.P.H.” : Melbourne dailies are pretend-
ing to be horrified at the idea of running elec-
tric trams in Collins-street. Why this street
should be sacrosanct is not understandable;
it has had the cable trams for 40 years or
more, and the Burke and Wills memorial
was taken away from the rise at Russell-
street to make room for the lines. It is
a highly commercialised street;: even the
eastern end is no longer exclusive. It is
all very well to talk of reserving Collins-
street for ’buses, but there is no sense in
compelling passengers to change from trams
to ’buses at the edge of the city. Hogan is
chipping in with a bill to make it necessary
for the Governor-in-Council to consent to
conversions from cable to electric lines.
* * * *
“Machete”: Queensland’s rail-motors are
pushing further afield; four different ser-
vices are now running in the Northern, Cen-
tral and Southern districts. The harried
Commissioner hopes they will stop the drift
of goods- and passenger-traffic to private
road services consequent upon the railway
strike. The motor-trains require only one
motorman and a conductor, instead of the
steam-train crew of two on the engine, one
in the van and a conductor or two for the
passengers. The outfit is practically a large-
sized motor-car running on rails. Anyone
who can manage the ordinary petrol-driven
car can easily learn to look after a petrol-
driven rail-car, which, incidentally, has
enough power to pull a trailer car on most
Queensland lines.
* * * *
“The Listening-Insect”: Australia may
have television sooner than expected. The
Television and Radio Laboratories Pty., Ltd.,
a Vic. concern, • is setting up works from
which, as is hoped, in 18 months’ time will
pour forth a simple attachment to existing
radio sets that will enable listeners to see
the speakers and singers as well as hear
them. The main device is similar to the
American radio-eye, which was recently
placed at a window and registered on a
screen all that was passing in the street
below. In addition, however, there will be
a special transmitting gadget due to Donald
MacDonald, of Sandringham, a director of
the concern. MacDonald’s invention has
already succeeded in rephotographing a movie
and projecting it on a second screen.
* * * *
“P.X.”: The four big cos., including
Howard Smiths and Dorman Longs, which
have thrown into a pot to start another
cement works in N. S. Wales—that will
make five big ones —are not overcrowding
things as badly as some people think. Tarred
macadam, which has been the most popular
road during the last few years, simply can’t
stand up to the battery of heavy cars; drop
a pebble in the way and see how the tarred
macadam is bruised by the blow a foot or
so ahead of the stone after a heavy truck
has bumped over it. It takes over 400 men
to keep the road from Sydney to Ivatoomba,
over the Blue Mountains, in decent repair;
and after the last Eight Hour Day week-end
it was reckoned that it would cost more than
£<Booo to repair the damage done to the 00
miles or so of track. Around Sydney muni-
cipal councils reckon that when they put
down tarred macadam they commit them-
selves to a maintenance charge of 7d. per
sq. yard per annum; and the most enter-
prising of them allege that a concrete road,
though it runs away with a deuce of a lot
of money to put down, can be maintair. -i
for 24d. per so. yard, and that a sinking
fund of 3d. will pay off the capital cost
while the road is still in existence.

Where General Motors Operates
y4s far away as the end of the world and as close to you as the
nearest General Motors Dealers —there General Motors operates.
TN each of Australia’s five States
there is located a General Motors
plant. Each is the headquarters
of General Motors operations in
that State, and, collectively, they
represent one of the most important
secondary industries of Australia.
They serve all Australian General
Motors dealers ; and, through them,
they serve you.
Were they to stand alone and
unsupported by the great world-wide
General Motors organisation, these
plants could not serve you so well
or so economically as they do.
Through these plants and through
the local General Motors dealers all
the advantages offered by General
Motors are made available to you.
Every General Motors dealer
every buyer of General Motors cars
shares in the economies made
possible by its great size. Every
buyer of a General Motors car gets
greater value, finer beauty, greater
safety, more comfort, at less cost
just because he is a member of the
General Motors family of 5,000,000
car owners.
General Motors cars are here
because they are everywhere else.
General Motors builds a car for
every purse and purpose. General
Motors cars are bought everywhere
simply because people find in
General Motors cars maximum value
at lowest cost.
General Motors is everywhere
because everywhere people want the
most for their money and because
everywhere more people are learning
that it pays to buy a General Motors
car.
It Pays to Buy a General Motors Car.

The Sydney Uni. celebrated its 75th anni-
versary by a birthday party in the Great
Hall. It was the first time in history that
a hot meal had been served there, but evi-
dently the lofty old grey stone walls
approved, and for once more draughts were
kept out than were blown in. The ante-room
to the Great Hall was used as a kitchen, and
from there the soup, the fish and the turkey
were conveyed to the trestle tables that
ran the length of the hall. Around these the
merely academic and brilliant were gathered.
At the table on the dais sat the G.-G.,
Priminister Bruce, the Jim Fairfaxes, the
Arthur Rickards, the J. B. Cramsies, Mac-
artliur Onslows, the F'rank Alberts and
so on. Of course, Chancellor William
Cullen, Vice-Chancellor Mungo MacCallum
and members of the Senate were there, too;
after all, it was a University party. The
MacCallum lady, in pearly greys, and Dr.
Constance D’Arcy and Red Cross Mrs.
R. R. S. Mackinnon, in their robes, were
striking lookers at the top table, and a
word must be said about Mrs. Frank
Albert’s tiara beset with diamonds.
If you are really smart you arrive at the
front doorstep of the Yacht Club at Kirri-
billi for the opening of that august club’s
season in a saucy, dancing, littih craft,
dressed in a nautical outfit. You throw out
the grappling irons, leap lightly on to the
landing-stage and then, while you look as
though you are ready to roll down to Rio,
the white harbor hounds, straining at the
leash, paw and prance the blue floor of Port
Jackson. Sister yachts afar off spread their
sails, still striving in the race, and the breeze
blows fresh, the trees are green and the
roses sweet in the old garden. So it was on
Saturday, at any rate; and it must be con-
fessed that not till a late hour in the day
was the absence of vice-regals noticed. The
old families of Kirribilli, Milsons and God-
dards and Taylors and Carments, came
round the corner to the party, the men
dressed as sailors, their womenfolk in the
bravery of afternoon silks and embroideries.
Tea was served from a gay marquee on the
side lawn, and here, when the billy boiled,
every man carrying two chairs and every
woman one, the company climbed around
from viewing the races and pitched their
camp.
Perhaps the week’s most attractive dis-
play was the Health Game of the Sunlight
babies of Blackfriars Infant Practice School.
Unselfconscious before their audiences, the
kiddies, under the smile of the principal,
Miss Stevens, each day went through the for-
mula which is opening the door to health
and happiness; said formula being to sit on
tiny chairs in the sunlight wearing a Helen
Wills eyeshade; to eat oranges; to drink
milk; to read play-books; to spell out health
mottoes on the sun screens; to dance to
simple tunes. Health films were shown, and
there was much dietetic advice given free.
But the price of green veggies still remains
prohibitive, and fruit has become the luxury
of the millionaire. Still, we feel that racial
hygiene is a little better assured, and that
any mother who doesn’t know a great deal
more about baby-welfare has only herself to
blame.
The little roof garden of the Women
Painters’ Club was like a flowered pavilion
out of Tennyson the other afternoon; and a
triumphal arch of palms reared its smiling
facade. This had been raised to the glorv
of Dame Mary Cook, wife of Australia’s
late High Commissioner, and in its cool
arcade she was to have rested while the
Women Painters presented her with flowers
in season. But down came a storm, thun-
der and lightning and hailstones as big as
marbles, so the hostesses contented them-
selves with forming a flowering avenue from
lift to club-entrance, each woman having her
arms filled with spring blossomings. Later
these were presented to the unobtrusive guest
and numbered something like 300. And later
still they glowed their lives away in the
city hospitals. The room was like a censer
streaming with earth scents; everywhere
lupins, poppies and pansies breathed deli-
cately. and on Dame Mary’s table were
turned into the inevitable boomerang. Pink
water-lilies reposed on the lady’s hat. which
was wide, beige in color and toned with her
frock of lace and georgette.
Like a fusillade of musketry the hail
beat on the roof of Rose Hall the other
afternoon just as the yearly meeting of the
Red Cross was about to begin. But a small
thing like a storm couldn’t daunt these war
workers, and once again, like an epic of
patience, the report of the year’s work was
read. It is so long since the war ended, yet
Mars still levies his toll, and the Red Cross
still leads its little army that fights the
disease the War God left in passing. T.B.
homes, convalescent homes, help to soldiers’
wives and children —every year heavy calls
are made on the society, and every year thou-
sands of pounds are poured out. directed
by the sympathetic interests of its members.
The little grey cells have had something
to work on these last few days, for Sydney
has been undergoing the physiological and
biological dissection known as Health Week.
Just as a religious retreat is a tonic for
the soul, so a week in which we, as it were,
stand outside our bodies and think of them
as a fortress of so much blood, bone, muscle
and tissue, against which time and disease
carry on a never-ending siege, must prove
both tonic and antiseptic to the health of
the community.
Monday afternon saw Dame Mary Cook
welcomed home by the women of Sydney—
or as many of their; as cared to squeeze into
the Ambassadors to do so. The place was
crowded, and a cyclone of greetings swept
over the palm court as Dame Mary, in
handsome blacks and golds, took her stand
at the foot of the entrance steps. A posy
of pink roses and forget-me-nots was thrust
on her by a committee which included Henry
Braddon’s lady, hatted and frocked in leafy
browns, and Mayoress Mostyn in misty blue
georgettes covered by an effective coat of
coarse-meshed mastic lace.
A black cat gave its blessing to the open-
ing of the Empire Theatre’s third produc-
tion, “Tweekie.” Undeterred by the noise
of the singing and dancing, it picked its
way across stage and settled down finally by
the footlights, staring with something like
surprise every time the audience applauded
or laughed. Ilis Majesty’s once had another
black cat —black cats are favorites in the
theatre—which made occasional appearances,
and on one occasion walked right across a
rippling river without wetting its toes.
When Rufe Naylor made the usual (alto-
gether too usual) after-show speech at the
“Tweekie” opening at the Empire Theatre,
he had something of interest to tell. Few
of the audience had guessed that little
Audrey Lewis, who played the important
part of Libby O’Dea, is a mere 16-year-
old Australian, new to the stage, who, hearing
that there was a difficulty about finding the
right girl for the part, asked to be tried in
it. and on one showing was acclaimed as the
girl for whom the management was looking.
Her Majesty’s was filled with the sounds
of a warm welcome when red-haired Rowena
Ronald made her first entrance in “Castles
in the Air.” Rowena. who is 23 and married
—her husband is Herbert Browne—was
born at Armidale. She was pursuing music
at the Conservatorium, having won the
Yvonne Charvin pianoforte scholarship, when
she gained a beauty competition, and the
Firm invited her to join the chorus. Five
years passed, during which, of course, she
studied singing and dancing, before Black-
man selected her to understudy Beppy de
Vries in “Madame Pompadour.” The Dutch
actress’s kindness in falling ill for a couple
of nights gave Rowena a larger opportunity;
and she did so well that the management,
which is positively hungry for adequate
women leads, lifted her into the principal
part of the latest production.
This nice girl, with what portrait-painter
John Longstaff would call a well-balanced
race, is Doreen Higgins, of Rose Bay. Just
now her ener-
gies are direct-
ed to stirring
up interest in
the Navy
League’s sea
cadets, par-
ticularly those
of the Rose
Bay - Bondi
company. Suc-
cess has at-
tended h e r
organising, for
each member
of the league
has guaran-
teed at least
two guineas
to the fund,
and one or
two generous
souls haveeven
obliged with
cheques for
£lO. Still another slice of the popular
Doreen’s week goes to the building up of
St. Luke’s Hospital. She is secretary of the
newly-wedded Darling Point - Woollahra
branch. Falk made the picture.
From the drum of stretched skin and the
singing stick to the perfect gramophone
record, everything was in pageant at the
Magic Notes Ball at the Town Hall on
Friday night. The Magic Notes themselves
quavered and semi-quavered about the rose
and daffodil pillars. The stage represented
a cabinet gramophone; on its top the
musicians were perched, and the swinging
open of the doors revealed in tableau various
phases of the pageant. Josephine Marks
arranged the tableaux, and topped off her
success in a marvellous Delilah costume. A
striking figure of the night was Mrs. Ferrari
Passmore as an Italian lady, century
unknown. A colossal Orlando Furioso undid
his helmet to mop his brow, while a be-
starred Night-time stood to hear the song
she represented sung by Lilian Mitchell. Mrs.
George Taylor (she and Mr. Wakeling were
secretaries) wore cloth of silver and lace,
and her husband was responsible for the
clever Magic Notes set. A group of Higli-
land lasses, their kilted skirts, plaidies and
alluring Tams made of Bond’s towelling,
were the most original poster-set in the
room. Eva Novak, very blonde above
black and silver and looking rather bored,
helped a group, among which was Mrs. Mark
Foy, to do the judging. Mrs. Mark, her hair
banded with diamond leaves, flung a rosy
length of tulle around a frock that was a
marvel of white beading on black moire. The
Columbia Go. was responsible for the ball,
and the funds go to swell the Hospital Satur-
day fund.
This thoughtful-looking baby, who is
apparently taking his first anatomy lecture,
is Irvine John Hunter, the son born a few
months after the death of his brilliant young
father, that Professor John Irvine Hunter
of ’whom Australia was so proud, and whose
untimely death it still does not cease to
mourn. Swiss Studios made the fine study.
The Society of Women Writers (as with
the Institute of Journalists the title has the
most catholic of interpretations) gathered
about its founder and first secretary, Mrs.
Aronson, one afternoon last week. The idea
was a sort of tea-drinking of appreciation.
This was preceded by much talk among the
50 or so who turned up, with bursts of song
from Alfred O’Shea and Queenslander Jean-
ette Ethelston. Mrs. Aronson, very handsome
in black georgettes, rose above a pyramid
of flowers to return her thanks, clutching in
the curve of her lace sleeve the official pre-
sentation, a gargantuan affair of pink roses
and carnations.
Gwen Selva, who left these shores as
Gwendolyn Spanswick, repatriated herself
the other night at the Con. in five languages
and two sets of costumes. The group in
which, dressed as a Watteau shepherdess,
she sang of old Arcadian days made a strong
feminine appeal. Margaret Chalmers’s clever
fingers wove the accompaniments, and Moore
MacMahon’s violin raised a storm of
applause.
The decks of H.M.A.S. Sydney have sup-
ported for the last time the glide of dancing
feet. The valedictory was set to a synco-
pated measure last week, when her Com-
modore and officers entertained the city’s
brightest and best (-known). After this
week the Sydney will be the flagship no
longer, and presently another million pounds
or so will go down to the cod and the gurnet.
The Melbourne, which is to become the flag-
ship, was linked to the Sydney by a floating
pontoon, and the party invaded both cruisers.
Canberra has already done something, at
any rate, for Australian horticulture. Until
the crazy capital where money doesn’t mat-
ter planted tulips by the thousand, the most
you could hope to see at a time in Aus-
tralia was a treasured dozen or so. Now
gardeners begin to strew their borders with
them; and there were armsful of early
bloomers, yellows chiefly, in the flower-shops
last week.
Last week the ball for the Mater Hospital
in North Sydney lived up to the reputation
it has sustained for 23 years. Perhaps
that is not a matter for wonder, for in the
whole 23 years the ball committee has had
the same president. She is Mrs. P. Leahy,
who is that rare combination, a woman of
force and amiability. The Wentworth was
once more the scene of the frivol, and here
Mrs. Leahy, sheathed in shining black
sequins, presided over one of the night's big
parties. The guest of honor was Mayoress
Mostyn, who was striking in vermilion and
gold; and film-star Eva Novak, who was in
surgeon Dan Kelly’s party, lingered on
the eye in a frilly fluff of marigold tulle.
Mrs. Kelly herself was a shimmer of lilac
sequins. The medical Deakins (he’s another
of the hospital’s honoraries) were among
other notable entertainers.
The Orient Company is blazing a trail
which might easily be followed by the other
big shipping houses. In January the co. will
complete its 50th year of trading with Aus-
tralia, and to jubilate it is giving a ball on
the Oronsay on December 6. But it isn't
to be an exclusive friend-of-the-l'amily affair.
Although the company will be the hosts for
the night, tickets w r ill be sold for one guinea
each, and the whole of the takings will go
to the Limbless Soldiers’ Aquatic Club
appeal. It is hoped to sell a thousand tickets,
arid the company is providing a sumptuous
supper and the best orchestras in Sydney.
The Chapel of Shor.e Grammar School
blessed the linking up of Irene Thompson,
of Neutral Bay, and Guy Hall, of the same
suburb. Arum-lilies and sweet-voiced choris-
ters added to the pictorial effect of the knot-
tying, in which the bride sustained her part
clad in glossy satin and a lace veil woven
over a hundred years ago. Jean Mackenzie
’maided in golden bronze tulle topped by a
mignonette-green crinoline hat. Toasts at
the bride’s Neutral Bay home, Wandeen.
St. Matthew's, at Manly, wore lilies and
roses in its hair the other night whom
Helen Moore, of that Continental waterfront,
bound herself over to keep the peace for life
with Professor F. Beasley, who has just
been appointed to a job in Perth Univer-
sity. Tlie wedding garment of white geor-
gette. thickly sown with pearls, was misted
over by a cascade of tulle, and sister Peggy
flitted after the bride, her frock a blue blaze
of sapphire. A party followed at the Hotel
Manly under the hospitable direction of Mr.
and Mrs. W. A. Moore.
The dinner dance to benefit Edwin Proud,
the cricketer who was blinded in the middle
of a game, filled the Ambassadors on Mon-
day night. Stewart Dawson and his wife
gave the Ambassadors, the dinner and the
orchestra, so that every ticket sold repre-
sented net profit. Furthermore, a dazzling
array of prizes for lucky numbers—the first
a nine-piece crystal dressing-table set—was
trundled from table to table on a dinner-
waggon like a particularly fascinating dis-
play of hors-d’oeuvres. You viewed these,
then paid your shilling and took your choice
—of lucky numbers.
Another link with the culture of early
Sydney was snapped by the death of Mrs.
Adelie Amelie Higinbotham, one of the most
popular members of the French community
in Sydney. The lady came to Australia a
girl of 14 who had already looked misery in
the face, for she had known the horrors of
the Siege of Paris. Her stepfather was the
artist Lucien Henry, who was one of the
first to see the decorative glory of Aus-
tralian flora and fauna. Her mother estab-
lished the first French Literary Circle in
Sydney, and this was carried on by Mrs.
Higinbotham up to the time when war-work
claimed her attention. She had a vivid per-
sonality and a gracious manner.
Agnes Goodsir has just completed a bril-
liant portrait of Miss Eaditli Walker. It
was painted at Yaralla, and is con-
sidered, one of the finest portraits by an Aus-
tralian ever achieved. Sir Dudley and Lady
de Chair are among those who have made the
pilgrimage to Miss Walker’s beautiful Con-
cord home to view the work.
To-morrow (Friday) at three o’clock
Bishop D’Arcy Irvine and Chief Justice
Street will share a job at the new St. Luke’s
Hospital in Darlinghurst. The ,C.J. will
conjure the front door open, and then the
Right Reverend will bless its works. After
this the Jubilee book of St. Luke’s Hospital
will be open for signatures, and will remain
so for three months. After that it will be
sealed under the floor of the entrance hall,
and is not to be unearthed till St. Luke’s
Day in 1977. After which fading ink and
curling page will fade and curl still more
among the tomes of the Mitchell Library.
Going on for £BOOO this Letter’s courier
reports the Rose Day fund. The suburban
money is not all in yet. so the committee
expects the total to equal if not overtop last
year’s £12,000.
The Arts and Crafters had their yearly
show opened for them yesterday by Ernest
Watt. The show is to be found at the Art
Gallery of the Education Department.
Miss Clunies Ross is off by the Ceramic to
visit her sister, Mrs. Martin Donohue, widow
of the war correspondent. She will spend
her Christmas in Constantinople with a
nephew, Professor Edmund Tilley.

The lily of the valley has fallen from
grace as a luck bringer. Had it lived up to
its reputation, about three-fourths of the
women at the V.A.T.C.’s jubilee meeting at
Caulfield on Saturday would have made for-
tunes. But things were not thus. The
defeat of Royal Charter in the Cup was the
greatest blow, and there were others. It was
a disappointing meeting altogether. The
weather was sultry with a hint of thunder,
and the masses of compressed human.ty
helped to make the atmosphere murk.er.
Even though the temperature was high,
there were not many light frocks on view.
Georgette and silken fabrics were worn
usually with coat or cape. Black gowns
and coats and skirts easily led all else, with
navy and pervenche blues dead-heating for
next place. White seems just as much out
as it can possibly be this season. The one
white voile frock seen stood out amid
the packed stands quite startlingly. Flounces
and frills again made appearance upon frocks
of figured-voile and silk, small patterns of
geometrical rather than floral designs being
favored. The black hat reigned supreme in
felt or straw. The smartest and most fash-
ionable women chose straws simply banded
with ribbon, no bows, and rarely a flower
to soften their severity, which can’t be much
good to the milliner.
The Governor-General, who was there to
present the cup to the winner, was accom-
panied only by an aide, but State Govern-
ment House sent a strong party, and his Ex.
and Lady Somers gave luncheon to many.
Her Ex. wore an ensemble gown of rust-red
georgette with checked pleats and a harmon-
ising straw hat. Sir Arthur Lawley and
Lady Lawley, she in mole georgette with a
black hat, and their niece, Miss Leatham,
whose wine-colored ensemble suit was re-
lieved with beige, came with the Govern-
ment House folk. Also of the party were
George Fairbairn and his lady, the latter
wearing a navy-blue costume with a dash of
purple upon her same-toned hat. The Alis-
ter Clark couple, Mr. and Mrs. E. M. Pearce
and Major and Mrs. Richardson were v.-r.
guests at luncheon. Mrs. Merson Cooper's
ivory-corded silk coat and skirt save an air
of coolness to the committee’s ladies’ box, and
Marie de Bavay, wearing grey georgette
with a pink rose resting upon a small grey
hat, looked seasonable. The pretty reseda-
green gown and hat of Mrs. Percy Black-
bourn was restful to the eye, as also was
the same colored frisca suit worn by Mrs.
Leslie Benjamin. Mrs. Frank Chartres and
her sister Mrs. Norman Shepherd were suc-
cessful demonstrators of black frocks and
hats with relief of beige pink and coat
posies of lilies of the valley. Mrs. A. Dunne,
of Camperdown, was there in black, and
Mrs. Otway Falkiner’s black ensemble with
white fur trimming was topped by wide-
leafed millinery. The good-looking wife of
Charlie Lyon was clad in biscuit georgette
with coat of the same, and a shady straw
hat. Premier Hogan’s busy wife was a
study in blue in coat and millinery. Mrs.
James Purves decorated her blue and fawn
figured foulard frock with a big blue chiffon
flower, and her sister Florrie Green was a
wearer of beige hue in gown and hat. Mrs.
Claude Grice, Mrs. T. A. Tabart, the Gren-
by Outhwaite couple, the Ben Chaffeys, the
Richard Lintons and their niece Elaine Lin-
ton, of Sydney, were seen on the lawn.
Though the day was so hot but few para-
sols made their apnearance.
Clerical garb rubbed shoulders with en-
semble frocks and gowns of stylish mode at
Archgaiters Lees’s garden-party at Bisliops-
court on Thursday afternoon. Mrs. Hard-
wick, the host’s sister-in-law, in gown of
cornflower blue and a rose-trimmed crinoline
straw hat, assisted to receive the guests.
Bishopscourt, which overlooks Fitzroy Gar-
dens from the East Melbourne side, has some
beautiful old trees in its charming gaounds.
Governor and Lady Somers and other guests
wandered in the sunshine, listening to a
string orchestra, and teacups were passed
around in a marquee. Her Ex. wore a
kasha ensemble suit of natural color, with
gold-embroidered trimming in pink and green,
and lime-green felt hat. Mayoress Morell’s
beige gown was topped by furs and a black
hat; the Clarke lady wore blue millinery,
with a blue dress almost covered by a light
fur coat: Mrs. Russel] Clarke's cosmos-pink
jumper suit, with Bangkok hat, was a season-
able effect, and the Grice lady was up-to-
date in black and white. Madame Turck,
wife of the French Consul, looked smart m
a caped suit of navy cloth, with a fetching
hat of the same color. General Harry
Chauvel and his good-looking lady, IJr.
J. C. V. Behan and his wife, and Canon and
Mrs. Snodgrass were other notables who
enjoyed archiepiscopal hospitality.
The State Governor and Lady Somers
had the loan of Federal Government House
for a couple of hours on Friday night. The
occasion was a reception to Miss Penne-
thorne, the organising secretary of the
Parents’ Educational Union. The guest of
honor, who carried her arm in a sling, the
result of an attack of blood poisoning, gave
an address on the aims, objects and methods
of the P.E.U. Lady Somers, who is familiar
with the work of the Union, expressed her
appreciation of its achievements and the
Governor said a corroborative word or two.
Her Ex. wore a simple frock of black geor-
gette and Miss Pennethorne was also in
black with a sparkle of silver beads. Irvine,
C.J., and his life partner. General Chauvel
and his lady, the John Winter Irvings, Pro-
fessor and Mrs. Woodruff and Miss Gilman
Jones were amongst those who showed inter-
est by attending.
There was revelry amid the palms on
Henley lawns on Friday night, when
National Gallery students held a fancy dress
hop at the Fernery, by way of honoring the
organisers of the students’ annual ball. The
decorations of the tea rendezvous were sup-
plemented by some weird silhouettes done
specially for the occasion. President Hender-
son and secretary Collier had the aid of a
quartette of fair fellow-students.
A bridge party in the lounge of the Wind-
sor one afternoon last week provided the
Q.V.H. Auxiliary with some sinews of war.
Mrs. W. M. Robins, who lately resigned the
presidency and became patron, was the
organiser, aided by Mrs. A. E. Boyes and
Mrs. Charles Nodrum. Mrs. Clarence Mar-
riott and assistants vended a wondrous col-
lection of lilac and spring blooms, and
cakes, sweets, cigarettes and bridge-scorers
were sold by Mrs. Harley Styles, Mrs. W.
P. Nunn and other matrons and a bevy of
girls that included Flo Boyes and Sheila
Morell. Mrs. Robins wore an ensemble suit
of black and white, Mrs. Nodrum also favor-
ing a magpie effect and Mrs. Boyes topped a
cerise silk frock with a hat of mushroom-
pink felt. Among the players were Mayoress
Morell, Mrs. Russell Martin, in black taffeta
with a touch of beige, Mrs. Merson Cooper,
Mrs. Norman Price, Mrs. Frank Tait and
Mrs. Felix Lloyd.

“The Whole Town’s Talking,” first seen
at the Theatre Royal on Saturday night,
seems to have been put on to absorb the
principals of the late “Katja” company. The
comedy introduces Marie Burke in the role
of a film star, which enables the lady to wear
some very striking gowns. One of these, a
mixture of Early Victorian and Watteau
shepherdess styles, is tight of bodice and
long and full of skirt in rose-pink taffeta
that melts into a filmy hem' of burgundy tone.
A turned-up hat of the two shades of pink,
and a directoire cane, are accessories. A
real movie turnout is a wonderfully-draped
gown of pale gold chiffon velvet, short, but
floating into a lengthy train; a coat of
parchment shade with floral embroidery har-
monises nicely. Rosie le Varde as Mrs.
Harriet Simmons wears a white georgette
frock with a bordering of white fur which
is out of the ordinary, and Thelma Burness,
Beatrice Fischer, Bertha Ricardo, and Bessie
Williams —the last-named making her first
appearance professionally—have the dainti-
est flapper dresses imaginable. Gilded fur-
niture and immense blue jars are the chief
features of the setting. The flower distri-
bution at the premiere was a show in itself.
The crowded house presented a larger area
of bare back and arm than we have seen
for a long time, for it was too hot for cloaks
or even shawls. Dr. and Mrs. Herbert Hew-
lett and daughter Nancy, the Felix Lloyd
couple, the C. J. Aherns, Mrs. Richard Fit-
cher, Mrs. Jim.' Angus in a silvery georgette
and tissue gown and the Percy Franken-
bergs were first-nighters. Eugene Duggan
in sparkling black raiment was an interested
spectator; her daughter, Mary Anderson,
appears in the role of a pert maid.
A large audience, mainly made up of mem-
bers of the society, viewed with rather
mixed feelings the Repertory presentation of
“Liliom” at the King’s Theatre on Satur-
day night. They couldn’t make up their
minds for some time whether it was intended
to be highly moral or highly scandalous. It
is not a dress show, but it has its moments
of that sort. There are picturesque pea-
sants, and Betty Rae as a merry-go-round
proprietress makes a startling entrance in
black and white striped satin, with white
feathers perched upon wine-colored velvet
millinery. Isabel Handley, who scored an-
other success as Julie, Myra W illiams, Betty
Rae, and many maidens in lesser roles were
rewarded with shoals of posies.
This is Stanley J. Allan, who is playing
the name-role in Gounod’s “Faust” at the
Princess Theatre just now —a production
organised by
the Victorian
Postal Insti-
t u t e Choi r.
Mr. Alla n,
who is a pupil
of Mad a m e
W a r burton,
has a line tenor
voice with
which lie com-
bines dramatic
talents. He
has had ex-
perience as
an understudy
with one of
the Firm’s
companies, and
as a principal
in tours of
Asia. Re-
turned to Mel-
bourne, he is
finding a cer
tain amount of scope in amateur operatic
productions. The picture is by Vandyck.
A transfer to the Theatre Royal for his
final concert seemed to increase interest
in tenor Joseph Ilislop, for on the night he
had to share the stage with an overflow
audience. Leila Doublcday (Mrs. Max
Pirani), who bowed, in more senses than one,
her farewell to Australia, received a gener-
ous tribute of flowers. The violinist was in
a frock of filmy black lace with dangling
cerise-and-green ribbons. In the audience
were Mrs. Joseph Hislop, wearing a silver-
brocaded wrap over glistening black raiment;
Max Pirani, who will rejoin his wife in
England in about three months’ time; Dr.
and Mrs. Bruce Hunt, Strella Wilson. Mrs.
T. H. Payne, Ella Payne and the Robinson
lady.
Scots’ Church, Collins-street, was filled
with Camperdown and lliverina folk one
night last week, when Jean, only daughter
of the Donald Macdonald couple, of Burn
Brae, Terang, had a plain gold ring thrust
on her finger by Ewen Sargood. She wore
a white crepe romaine gown with pearl
embroidery on the front panel and on the
narrow train. Her tulle veil was edged with
filmy lace, and she carried a posy of pink
roses and lilies of the valley. The bridal
array was a gift from Dame Nellie Melba —-
Mrs. Macdonald, ivho was Zoe Mitchell,
is the diva’s cousin. Bridesmaids Helen
Lempriere, May Wettenhall and Bell HoJ-
gate were in blue georgette frocks, with a
sheen of silver and pink tissue beneath ; they
had harmonising hair bandeaux and bouquets
of pink roses. The ’groom, who is second
son of the W. E. Sargoods, of Quat
Quatta, Corowa, N.S.W., is likely to forsake
the land for commercial life in Sydney, in
the wholesale house of the softgoods _ clan.
Dame Melba took part in the after-rejoicings
at No. 9 wrapped in a wondrous cloak of
white chiffon-velvet and gold _ tissue, with
diamonds sparkling in her hair.
Pale pink georgette, tulle and silver
tissue, sprinkled with crystal, a veil of old
Limerick lace and a great sheaf of pink
roses made a fascinating bridal array for
Winifred Elizabeth Couchman when she said
“I will” to Roy Lyle Capp. Her two ’maids,
Jean Hart, of Sydney, and Beryl Couchman,
her cousin, contrasted powder-blue frocks
and crinoline hats with bouquets of crimson
roses. The bride’s father, Claude Couchman,
is a power in the sports world, and her step-
mother is president of the Women's National
League. The just-acquired son-in-law is
youngest son of the C. G. Milton-Capp
couple, of Lancdene. Keimbah, West Mait-
land.
TJla Morton, daughter of the Dr. Murray
Mortons, is gathering together a trousseau.
She has an '“appointment with Lieut.-Com-
mander Rhodes early in December.
Cwynneth Marguerite, eldest daughter of
the Archibald Johnsons, of Windsor, has
accepted a token and given a pledge tp John
Roland Adams, youngest son of the late
Alexander Adams, whose widow lives in Fog-
town.
Mardi Younger, whose fiancee, Brian
Baker, is steaming in this direction, has left
her home in the western district for the
city, and is gaily punctuating the waiting
period with a series of entertainments. The
altar date is fixed a week after Cup to allow
the new arrival to get his bearings and dip
into the social activities of Carnival Week.
Norman Lindsay’s exhibition of water-
colors and etchings at the Fine Arts
Gallery has been the most successful
art show yet staged in the city which
bears the burden of the Felton Bequest. The
whole series of etchings was sold, and four
water-colors at these prices: “Consorts at
Dawn,” 250 guineas; “The Grape,” £5
guineas; “Sunlight’s People,” 70 guineas;
and “S-sh —My Husband,” 50 guineas. “Cap-
tain Funklc and Randolph Jiblet,” the
quaintest of them all, was bought by the
Felton Bequest.
Thea Proctor’s drawings, water-colors,
woodcuts and fans will decorate the walls
of the New Gallery until the 22nd of this
month. Dame Nellie Melba launched the
show one afternoon last week. She was
looking her best in a jumper suit of sand-
hued crepe de Chine with a cape of the
same tone of frisca, and her hat was of tan-
colored felt and straw. Miss Proctor wore
black-and-white check silk with flounced
skirt, the top frill turned up at the back to
form' a butterfly bow, long silver ear-rings,
and a large black hat. Mrs. George Arm-
strong, who accompanied Dame Melba, was
in an ensemble of black satin with a nattier
blue felt hat. The Spencer lady, the George
Bell couple, Mrs. Harry Whiting, in very
smart covering of navy blue, Mrs. Jim Wil-
kinson. Phyllis Holmes Hunt, a symphony
in autumn tones, Mrs. Arthur Moule and
Valerie Moule were amongst those who had
the first peep.
Ida Rentoul Outliwaite made a little slio\4
the other day of some drawings she intends
to send to London. The 29 exhibits included
fantasies in color and in black and white.
A few of the pictures have been seen before,
but some of the most charming have not.
There are elves and fairies galore, and pretty
children with flowing golden locks in the
usual manner. Among some delightful water
effects was one entitled “Harbor,” depicting
a sprite pushing a shell into a haven among
some reeds, and another, “The Child of the
Nautilus,” showing a baby curled up in a
shell, watched by an older human.
Though rain came down in torrents
Wirths’ Olympia was packed when S. W.
Hedger, superintendent of the R.V.1.8.,
carried through a concert programme in
which performers from the institute were
joined by pupils from the Bosworth Phy-
sical Culture College. The orchestra of
blind players played several numbers, there
were graceful dances by sightless boys and
girls, the latter wearing very pretty dresses,
and the whole show went well.
The Gentlewoman’s Aid Society’s sale at
the Malvern Town Hall was opened by
Mayoress Wilmot. A sale held, in autumn
brought in £351, and it was hoped that the
second one would return even more. Mrs.
John Tremearne is president of the society,
which has been carrying on its good work
for over 30 years. It is not a charity organi-
sation, for the workers buy their own
materials and the committee merely organises
sales and takes orders for the articles pro-
duced.
Feminine golfers—mostly of the matronly
brigade—are banding themselves together to
form a club of their own. Already a select
committee has found what it regards as a
suitable site for links, and expert opinion
has confirmed the wisdom of the choice. It
will be an expensive plaything. About
£25,000 will be required, but apparently there
isn’t going to be much difficulty in getting
the money. For various reasons the club
isn’t likely to be overwhelmingly popular
with the younger set.
“A.G.M.” (London) writes:—
The Countess of Stradbroke is recovering from
her serious illness, but will not be able to leave her
room for some time. She is at Henham Hall, Wang-
ford, Suffolk, where a very fine garden is among the
show-places of the neighborhood.
After half a century, Bennett Altson of Melbourne
has returned to his birthplace, Middlesbrough, York-
shire. When at the age of 19 he set out to seek
fortune in Australia his father gave him a cheque
for £2O. This he has now brought back to Eng-
land with him—uncashed. He battled through with-
out it.
Canon Dalton, who visited Australia in the Bac-
chante as tutor to King George and the late Duke of
Clarence, is living in the Cloisters, Windsor Castle,
and is now 88. Every year he is invited to Balmoral,
George and Mary, regarding him as one of their
oldest friends.
Another guest at Balmoral will be remembered try
Diggers who came under her ministrations in hospital
in Blighty—Agnes Keyser, matron of King Edward
VII. Hospital in Grosvenor-square.
Lady Caroline Agar, daughter of the Earl of
Normanton, is about to sail for Australia, where she
will be the guest of Lord and Lady Somers. Her
English home is at Somerley, near Bingwood, in
the New Forest, and it possesses one of the finest
picture galleries in Hampshire. A younger sister,
Lady Rosemary Agar, was one of the season’s debs.

TIMBER FAMINE INEVITABLE.
BRITISH EMPIRE “ALMOST DEFENCELESS” AGAINST IT.
WHY QUEENSLAND FORESTS, LTD., PROMISE £lOO FOR EVERY £5 INVESTED.
As the price of any commodity is governed chiefly by available supplies, timber will prove a remarkable investment in a
few years. Forestry authorities in every country are unanimous in predicting a world-wide shortage. Only last month the rollowm e
cable appeared in leading Australian journals:—
“At the session of the forestry sub-section of the British Association to-day, Sir Peter Clutterbuck said that the British
Empire was almost defenceless against the coming famine in softwoods. Some authorities thought that the supplies would be
exhausted in 25 years. Canada, whose virgin forests would not last out that period, already was sending 83 per cent, or its annual
output to the United States. The seriousness of the shortage was being recognised, and steps were being taken in most parts or the
Empire to start or to improve forest management on scientific lines, but what had been done was insufficient. Afforestation on a
large scale was necessary.”
A Queensland Afforestation Scheme.
To provide against the timber famine, Queensland Forests, Ltd., purchased large areas in North Queensland after inspection
of existing timber standing by competent officials and consideration of afforestation possibilities from every viewpoint. Mr. W.
Petrie, late Experimental and Investigation Officer in the Queensland State Forest Service, who has a lengthy and practical experience
of Queensland forestry to his credit, has since reported that the quality of the soil for tree-growing purposes is excellent.
Varieties of Timber.
Trees on the Company’s property include Hoop, Bunya and Kauri Pines, Maple, Silkwood, Silky Oak, White Quandong,
Teak, Mahogany and many other timbers of commercial value. Nearly all the timbers are indigenous, and the growth is pro i
owing to heavy rainfall and rich soil.
Initial Operations.
All the preliminary work, including topographical, assessment and soil surveys, is well in hand, as well as the regenerating,
nurturing and planting of trees, which is being done by skilled foresters under the supervision of Mr. Petrie. This wall ensuie a
substantial increase of the large profits which could be made by marketing the trees in their natural state. Road, rail and rivei
facilities are available for marketing purposes.
Money in Trees.
The Secretary of the Ballarat Water Commissioner stated recently that trees on his Company s property, aged 23 to 25
years, are worth 22/6 each, and that there are at least 500 trees to the acre. North Queensland trees are among the most va ua e
in the world, and thousands of them are growing already on the Company’s property.
Public Confidence.

Lady Goodwin went to Mrs. Gilbert Wil-
son’s pupils’ concert, taking Mrs. de Witt
Batty with her. The usual foam of flowers
decked the platform, and there were some
beautiful voices amongst the budding prima
donnas. Remarkable for production as well
as quality of tone was the singing of Cecil
Hives. Society attended the function in
force.
For the Distressed Diggers the Trocadero
was hung with gay lanterns and dressed in
gumtips, flags and gaillardias, with a jar of
amaryllis for the vice-regal corner. To the
ball came Lady Goodwin and Colonel and
Mrs. Campbell. Her Ex. was in cornflower-
blue, Mrs. Campbell wore black and gold,
Mayoress Jolly had a frock of primrose
mariette, and Mrs. T. J. Ryan was in white
and silver. Mrs. 11. It. Carter presented La
France roses to Lady Goodwin and Iceland
poppies to Mayoress Jolly.
A very charming procession was arranged
by the CrSche and Kindergarten committee
on Friday, when dimpled tots were dressed
up as goblins and brewed and baked and
scrubbed and played on wide, flower-
wreathed lorries. There was a most delec-
table cottage, reminiscent of the house in
“The Blue Bird,” and kiddies like the blos-
soms of spring, in reds and golds and greens,
advertised the hopes of Queensland.
Pretty Rinda Robbins married Guy Ather-
ton, son of the Tom Athertons, of Melbourne,
amid white lilies and red roses in St. John’s
Cathedral. The bride, who is the only
daughter of the W. E. Robbins couple, of
Rosebank, Auchenflower, and who was pre-
sented at Court while in London recently,
wore ivory chiffon and Venetian lace. Her
veil of old Venetian point had a coronet of
orange blossoms, and her bouquet was of
orchids, lilies of the valley and orange
blossom. Edna Taylor ’maided in powder-
blue and silver. Her picture hat was blue,
and she carried crimson roses.
At St. Margaret’s School Chapel Merival
Douglas Strother took Elsie Mitchell Ben-
net for better or worse, amidst bowls of
white lilies. The bridegroom comes from the
Murray River, N.S.W., and the bride is
daughter of the Fred Bennetts, Ascot. She
wore a picture frock of ivory tulle, and a
Brussels-lace veil, lent by Mrs. Bruce Nichol.
Stella Bruce Nichol ’maided in fuchsia mari-
ette, and wee Amy Anning was trainbearer.
In All Saints’ on the same day Dr. E.
Mason claimed Brenda Robertson for keeps.
The bride was in ivory and silver.
At the Albert-street Methodist church Bill
Lord, son of the E. F. Lords, Eskdale, mar-
ried Ida Atthow, daughter of the G. A.
Atthows, Clayfield. The bride was in beige
over pink.
Nancy L. Wright, daughter of the David
Wrights, of Inverloch. Ascot, has accepted
the ring of promise from Arthur Baynes,
son of the Indooroopilly Bayncses.
WESTRALIA.
Perth.
Show-week has been gala time here. The
city has been full of visitors, shop-windows
have been dressed for the occasion, business
everywhere has been brisk, and a record
crowd filled the showgrounds at Claremont.
Theatres and picture-palaces have been “posi-
tively turning ’em away,” and private par-
ties have made the nights and early mornings
gay. The opening of the racing season at
Ascot brought a festive week to a bright
end.
At the latest-held Karrakatta Club dance
Mrs. G. 11. Johnston, president of the club,
received the guests in a frock of cream maro-
cain elaborated with gold. Mrs. Ferguson-
Stewart, president of the entertainment com-
mittee, wore primrose georgette and silver.
Gorgeous roses gave their fragrance to the
reception and supper-rooms, and the affair
was most exclusive.
Mrs. 11. A. Craven Griffiths, seen here
with the eye of a Lafayette camera, is State
president of the Country Women’s Associa-
tion. She has occupied that position ever
since the asso-
ciation was
formed four
years ago. She
has visited
every district
and every
country town
in the State,
and has estab-
lished many
new centres.
Also she has
opened many
of the rest-
rooms that
have sprung
up in all parts
of the country,
thanks to her
industry and
that of her
colleagues.
Mrs. Griffiths is
a member of
the committee for the After-Care of the
Insane and is a foundation member of
the Silver Chain committee, which has been
at work for 20 years.
A great deal of sympathy is felt for Mrs.
Ernest Chase, “Adrienne” of the West
Australian, whose husband died suddenly
on Saturday. Mrs. Chase has been record-
ing social activities for a quarter of a cen-
tury.
The All Nations’ Ball, held at Government
House, was organised by the Country
Women’s Association, with Mrs Griffiths in
command, to raise funds for a seaside homo
for country women and children. The Mit-
chell lady, Mrs. Phil Collier, Mrs. Munsie
and Mrs. Troy acted as judges of the fancy
dresses and sets. A Spanish set, a wonder-
ful Maharajah and Maharanee, and a pair
of Apaches, were amongst the winners.
Leighton Woodroffe, of the Commonwealth
Bank, has won a promise true from Betty,
daughter of Mr. and Mrs. A. H. Mountain,
of Geraldton. Betty Mountain won public
favor in the role of “Bluebird,” and was a
dainty giblet in the “Gaiety Pie” co. Athol,
only son of Walter Cross, of the States
Press, and Daisy, of the Burkett clan at
Cottesloe, have also come to an understand-
ing regarding matrimony.
. TASMANIA.
Hobart.
Spring in Hobart is a lovely time.
But not until one has spent a day m
the Huon district or out at Lenah
Valley, among the acres and acres of pink
apple-bloom, does one realise what a glor-
iously beautiful world it is just now.
Margaret O’Grady crowned the small
queen, Mary Glaskin, at the miniature Bush
Nurses’ carnival at the Town Hall, before
an admiring crowd of parents and relations.
Twelve small girls in trim nurses’ uniforms
made a pretty group round the coronation
chair. Premier Lyons’s wife, who had come
all the way from Devonport, warmly praised
the good work done by the association. The
concert which followed the ceremony .was
enlivened by the singing of 10 very little
nigger boys, who were absolutely free from
stage-fright and who gave three cheers for
the Governor with much spirit. Mrs. Baxter
was responsible for the organisation. The
throne was surmounted by a realistic blue-
bird, with electrically-lighted eyes, and the
stage was charmingly decorated.
This is Mrs. Mary Taylor, a well-known
figure in public life in Hobart. She has been
associated
with the poli-
tical affairs of
the State for
many years,
and completed
21 years of
service for the
National Fed-
eration this
year, mainly
as organising
and divisional
secretary.
Budding poli-
ticians go to
her for advice.
She is one of
the picture
censors, too,
and the Con-
sumptive San-
atorium and
Wattle League
each claim
her as an executive officer.
Tlie University has been active in the
matter of entertainments recently. The
Engineering Faculty held a hop in the Uni.
Library, which was tigged out in green-and-
white streamers and flags for the occasion.
Some of the frocks were very smart, and
here and there the new high waist-line
attracted attention.
Our little over-tlie-water suburb, Belle-
rive, had its great day recently, when Premier
Lyons laid the foundation-stone of the new
.Town Hall, which is to replace the small
building, in use since 1865, and long since
inadequate to requirements. Quite a big
crowd rolled up, and after the deed was
done the Warden entertained the principal
visitors at tea at the Clarence Hotel.
The orchestra of “Kissing Time” at the
Theatre Royal contains quite a number of
feminine players. Pianist, violinist, flautist,
eornetists all are women. Marion de Saxe,
the flautist, has also taken up the saxophone
and claims to be the first of her sex to play
that instrument in Australia.
Marion Stevens, only daughter of Com-
mander and Mrs. Stevens, Melbourne, has
accepted a token from Donald McCall, son
of one of Tassie’s political knights (de-
ceased) and his lady.
SOUTH AUSTRALIA.
Adelaide.
For once racing brought fine weather, and
Morphettville was ail aglow with color and
a-sliimmer with the gleam of silks and crepes
de Chine. There was summer in headgear,
too —wider of brim than we’ve seen for ages,
i hough the picture species that has again
come into its own in England makes only
shy and rare appearance. Navy-blue and
Avhite, topped by a navy hat, and a slim-cut
putty-colored ensemble constituted two of the
smartest frocks on the lawn, and voile was
at its filmy best on a fair-haired member of
the younger set. The Governor was there on
the first day, and again on Wednesday, when
the weather turned thumbs down on frip-
peries, and furs and tweeds were dug out.
The Governor opened the sale of goods
from the Red Cross Handicrafts shop, staged
at the Lady Galway Convalescent Home,
where the matron and the Handicrafts’ sec-
retary, Dorothy Gilbert, received him. His
Ex. has also been responsible for a brisk
sale of his own water-colors, which the C.J.
declared open. A good many people knew
that pieces signed “T. Bridges” were worth
looking at, but few realised the extent and
versatility of the artist’s talent, and the geo-
graphical range that the exhibition would
cover. Proceeds are for the Limbless
Soldiers’ Association.
Fetes and fairs and meetings of old
scholars’ associations are our chief distrac-
tions at the moment. Of the latter the week
has given us two —the Advanced School for
Girls (long since merged into the High
School), where bridge was the medium of re-
union, and the Presbyterian Ladies’ Col-
lege, the oldest old girl of which is still in
her early twenties.
The head of the Bonython family—head
also of the Advertiser —has just been
snowed under congratulations : he entered his
80th year on Saturday. His has been a
life full of service to the public, and South
Aus. still has no more actively useful
citizen.

As usual, the climax arrives with thrilling brevity:—
Stirred by the wind the tall tree’s did sway;
A group of woodsplitter’s, by their camp-fire were
seated —-
Active young men, and tough veteran’s grey.
“Play us a tune,” exclaimed a young fellow
To the American axeman from far o’er the main
Who rattled the key’s of he’s quaint concertina,
And rendered a jig for an opening refrain,
To the Swanee river and star spangled banner.
The splitter’s enchanted, at each other did stare;
The melodious strains of the sweet concertina
By the skill of the player seemed to ring in the
air.
A week from that night a fatality happened.
“Help, for God sake!” cried a splitter named Lee.
The horrified men to the fatal spot hurried—
The American lay jammed ’neath a fallen Tree.

THE INKY WAY.
“Kobbi” : Re payment for a. single letter
or symbol. Years ago, the Sydney Worker,
which used to talk of the fiberai party, paid
me half a crown for adding the Ikenstein
touch to the other end, and £ibera£ as a
political label found a regular place in its
editorials for several months afterwards. I
have often wondered since whether it was
worth the money.
“8.E.”: “Haka” (B. 6/10/’27) and other
claimants are all out of it. I have been sub-
mitting pars, and short stories to The Bul-
letin for 27 years, and if this gets in
it will be the first prose effort of mine to
achieve such distinction. I, however, have
had verses printed.
“F.D.D.” : It took me 15 years to break
into The Bulletin. I wrote first from St.
Louis, Missouri, U.S.zV, in 190 S, and sub-
sequently from various parts of the world.
In 1928 I wandered into The Bulletin
office and handed a par to a boy behind the
counter; and the next week my initials were
in the Abo. column.
“Lao-dah”: From the editorial announce-
ments of the Justice of the Peace, organ
of Victorian Jay Pays:—
Mr. R. T. Chenowcth, the editor of our journal, is
away on a short trip to America. During his absence
Mr. J. T. P. OMeara is filling the editorial chair, and
his work is giving general satisfaction.
Presumably inserted by the printer’s devil.
“P.X.”: The Bulletin’s “Hop,” though
a genial soul and generally the centre of a
convivial group in the days when the Athe-
naeum Club flourished in Sydney, was withal
no spendthrift, and, aided in his investments
by his old friend William Macleod, he man-
aged to leave £45,000 behind him; and that
didn’t include the value of his fine home at
Mosman, surrounded by native trees which
he most carefully preserved. His will men-
tioned that his friend Macleod was the
guardian of his infant children; but the
document was a very aged one—Hop had
been a widower for over 30 years.
“Knib”: H. P. Douglass, managing-
director of Geelong Advertiser (Vic.), left
£51,545. The paper was his goldmine, and
he knew how to hold on to the yields. Melb.
dailies should remember him gratefully for
training some first-rate men for them. And
they were mostly easy to get, for Douglass
would never raise their salaries to keep them
at the Pivot.
The N.S.W. elections produced a fine crop
of libel writs, the majority against news-
papers. The biggest claimant is S. Y. Maling.
who wants £20,000 from the Sunday News.
while Willis will be contented with £lO,OOO
from Smith’s Newspapers. “Ironbark Andy"
Lysaght assesses the injury inflicted on him
by the Sun at a similar figure, and Mark
Gosling would like to draw the same sum
from the S. M. Herald as a solatium. The
Labor Daily is pursued by M.L.F. Jarvie
and Cecil Murphy for £5OOO and £2OOO.
Two or three country papers are threatened
with actions for slightly less imposing
amounts.
“Kobbi”: I asked a paper which sends
me a cheque occasionally for “Lit. contribs”
(at sixpence an inch) to add exchange.
The snort in reply almost lifted the stamp
off the envelope. But why not? As a
countrysider I have to add exchange for
every trifling payment I make by cheque,
even wdien I forward my annual subscrip-
tion to this particular journal.
“The Welkin”: The most widely-known
Australian freelance must surely be E. S.
Sorenson. There are few journals inviting
outside contributions which haven’t at some
time or another published work with “E.S.S."
at the foot of it. His great asset, apart from
his industry, is his knowledge of the back
country; he w r as brought up on a N.S.W.
North Coast farm, and later camped under
many a mulga in the Far West. And though
he has been years and years in the city ne
remains a bushman, as shy of intruding, even
in offices where he is most welcome, as he
w y as the first day he handed in a wad of
copy.
“Igdrasil”: In the cargo manifest of the
First Fleet mention is made of a small
press capable of printing about 50 sheets
an hour. It remained idle for want of a
skilled printer until 1795, when George
Hughes was placed in charge of it for the pro-
duction of official orders and announcements.
He was succeeded in 1802 by George Howe,
who founded the Sydney Gazette in March.
ISO 3. Howe himself bought the paper, set
the type, worked the press and distributed
the output. Howe died in 1821. and was
succeeded by his son Robert. Eight years
later he was drowned; the Gazette was
continued under various controllers until
1842, when it ceased to appear.
THE SPUING POEM.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
What chance has verse inscribed like this
To get beyond rejection?
Though editors applaud or hiss,
Though rigorous correction
Blue-pencils each pellucid page,
I’ll dare to flout the critics’ rage,
For petals star the shadowed hills,
And I am drunk on daffodils.
When ev’ry gum-tip flames and burns,
When clematis is climbing
Above boronia’s scented urns,
How can one keep from rhyming?
The air is filled with little bells,
A faery carillon which tells
That slow, reluctant daylight dies
To chiming songs of silver-eyes.
Deserted by each paling star
The bark of night is drifting.
Beyond the purple heights afar
A sinking moon is sifting
Soft silver on a drowsy sea.
A little wind sings in each tree
“Over the hills and far away
To meet the crimson-flowered day.”
Perchance I should have mentioned beer
Within these lines, or “blanky”
(A touch erstwhile employed, for fear
Poetic hanky-panky
Without a flippant touch would fail) ;
But ah, I’ve quaffed the magic grail
Of Spring, when that sweet jade instils
The golden wine of daffodils.

♦
There is more than the usual allowance
of melodious romance in “Castles in the
Air” at Her Majesty’s in Sydney. John
Brown, one of a pair of holidaying students,
is prankishly welcomed, at a club run as a
hobby by a young heiress and her guardian,
as his Highness the Prince of Latavia, and
the heiress artfully exchanges places with a
cigarette-seller so that John may fall in love
with her without incurring the suspicion of
being a fortune-hunter. Her guardian, Rod-
man, who has millions to spend on such
pleasant jests, carries on the joke by remov-
ing the whole company to Latavia, an
impoverished little kingdom only too glad
to defray the cost of its army of one general
(Frank Hawthorne) and about a dozen sol-
diers by leasing mediseval castles to rich
Americans. As is natural, if not inevitable,
in musical comedy, John Brown is promptly
recognised in his new setting by various
persons, including the Queen Regent, as the
Latavians’ real prince, who was supposed to
have been assassinated in his infancy but
somehow escaped. When the plots of an
intriguing Chancellor have been frustrated
John takes the throne and the girl of his
heart; and the audience is sent home with
the lilt of decidedly attractive music in its
ears. That music is matched by the bright-
ness of the stage settings, one of the inci-
dentals being an amusingly contrived doll
dance.
* # * *
The new show serves to introduce Rowena
Ronald as a feminine lead, and a new impor-
tation in Roy Russell, who plays the
princely John Brown. The red-locked lady
makes Evelyn Devine natural and alluring
enough to satisfy the audience, but there is
a lack of that complete confidence and assur-
ance in her work which is necessary to give
full conviction to any part. She sings and
acts creditably, and needs only experience
to overcome her deficiencies. Roy Russell
who has a remarkable resemblance on the
stage to poet Hugh McCrae, has a good
voice, but is inclined to staidness; Byrl
Walkley makes an attractive and sparkling
Ju Ju Durant, and Floi Allen presents
Annie Moore as a pleasantly brisk and ener-
getic young lady. Cecil Ivellaway and Gus
Bluett handle the comedy efficiently without
indulging in any wild doings, Bluett as the
student pal of the Prince Charming and
Ivellaway as Rodman. Their contrasted
styles help the piece considerably. As a
mediaeval fool who is one of the appurten-
ances of the Latavian castle, Leo Franklyn
shows remarkable agility. Gaston Mervale
is the scheming Chancellor, and Beatrice
Day the Queen-Regent.
* * * *
Although “Tweekie,” the new Empire
Theatre (Sydney) production, falls a long
way short of the standard of “The Student
Prince” in musical quality and story uphol-
stery, it has points which may endear it to
a public that likes music it can whistle
and patter it can roar at, mixed with a little
seasoning of soft sentiment. The thin thread
of plot starts in the village of Crossville
Corners, where Mary Thompson says good-
bye to John Cousins as that green and
bumptious youth, tired of paperhanging, sets
off for New York to make his fortune as an
artist. Thereafter Crossville Corners is,
presumably, wiped off the map, for the
entire population make their appearance in
that Greenwich village which is the N’Yark
equivalent of London’s Chelsea or St. John’s
Wood. Even Silas O’Day, who keeps the
store by the single-track railway terminus,
puts up the shutters and joins in the rush.
Mary Thompson has invented the “Tweekie”
doll, which is put on the market with the
aid of a wealthy young philanthropist who,
being engaged to another girl, wants no kisses
in return for his philanthropy; and she does
much better than John, who is glad to take
a job as “expresser of emotion” to an elderly
female who regards it as beneath her dig-
nity to do her own expressing. John, at his
parting with Mary, had pressed on the lady
a present of a hundred dollars, which she is
only induced to accept on the understanding
that it gives him a half-share in her doll;
and she insists that half the prosperous
business belongs to him until staggered by
the information that the young philanthro-
pist had so worded the documents that the
whole of the concern belongs to him. But
that, of course, is only the application of
the acid-test to John. Nobody believes, really,
that Bartlett is the villain he says he is;
and as John proves true metal under the
test, the usual happiness floods the scene at
the conclusion. But the happiness was
postponed on the first night, as so often
happens, until getting on for midnight; and
that is altogether too late.
* * * *
Some catchy songs and lightsome dances
are the new show’s best recommendation;
but the effortless work of Bobby Jarvis as
the raw John Cousins is a powerful aid.
John’s business in life seems to be to make
himself ridiculous; but Jarvis knows how to
drop the comedy and swing real feeling into
his work upon occasion. The 16-year-old
Australian Audrey Lewis makes a hit as
the vivacious Libby O’Day. There is nothing
in her brightly sustained work to indicate
that she is a mere newcomer to the stage,
pushed up from the chorus into an important
part. Aileen Poe is a Mary Thompson
with some emotional appeal, but she lacks
distinction. Edna Dare makes the part of
Sonia Mason sparkle considerably* and Nancy
Girdwood has flashes as the jealous Mildred
Ripley. The best singing is provided by
Arthur Clarke as the wealthy benefactor,
Bartlett; Loring Smith is a breezy Jack
Hayden; and Bertie Wright works as hard
as usual to get all the laughs possible out of
Silas O’Day. Harry Hall is the producer of
the show, which, like the new Williamson
musical comedy, includes a doll-dance
amongst the ballets.

For the third time, two clever sisters, Rita
Lancaster and Dorothy Larsen, have pre-
sented an old operatic favorite to Sydney
audiences. On Saturday night at the Con.
Miss Lancaster led the orchestra while Mrs.
Larsen directed the stage forces in Verdi’s
ever-popular “II Trovatore.” The author of
the opera, had he lived in these days, would
surely have left all movie directors behind.
Troubadours, knights, ladies, lonely castles,
gipsies, burnings, duels and prison scenes
are presented with a rapidity that staggers the
ordinary eight-hour-a-day melodrama worker.
Helen Stewart, as the lovely and much-tried
Leonora, was both dramatic and tuneful.
The Count di Luna was stirringly portrayed
by Victor Evans, who sang robustly and
managed his flame-colored cloak with a
swagger. Manrico, in silvery armor, was

interpreted in a silver (of the smaller cur-
rency) tenor by Carlo Martini. His singing
and acting in his protracted interview with
the gipsy Azucena were particularly effec-
tive.

There will be two new arrivals in Sydney
showhouses on Saturday. “Our Wife”
vacates the Criterion in favor of Somer-
set Maugham’s “Rain” ; and Frank Neil will
bring “The Gorilla” to the Grand Opera
House, where Nellie Bramley is reviving
“Peg of My Heart” for the last few nights
of the season. “Lady, Be Good” will take
its place among the winners by celebrating
its hundredth performance at the St. James
next week. Moscovitch’s “The Ringer,”
after running for nearly 11 weeks, still
keeps the Royal so full that the Firm has
been given the chance of changing its mind,
and “The Terror” instead of “The Music
Master” is likely to be the successor. “Out-
ward Bound,” perhaps the most interesting
play Sydney has seen for years, remains at
the Palace.
H*
There were no spare spaces in the Syd-
ney Town Hall on Saturday afternoon and
night, when the Commonwealth Band gave
a taste of its world-beating qualities. There
is a sonority of tone in the work of A. H.
Baile’s combination that eliminates all
brassiness; and the packed audience de-
manded encores for every number. At the
night performance it got “Lead, Kindly
Light,” as an extra after Tschaikowsky's
“1812” Overture, and both were played mag-
nificently. The programme showed variety in
airs from Weber’s “Der Freischutz,” and
“TWEEKIE,” AT SYDNEY EMPIRE.
Bobby Jarvis as Johnny; and Bertie Wright
as Silas O’Day.

and Alfred O’Shea sang in a way that pro-
voked just as insistent demands for extras,
O’Shea’s “Molly Brannigan” being a par-
ticular favorite.

Jim Gerald has made such a success of
“The Honeymoon Girl” that the Fuller vaude-
ville tradition is violated by its continuation
for an extra week. Olsen and Johnson con-
tinue their boisterous antics at Sydney Tivoli','
with some alterations in the items supplied byj
Elizabeth Morgan and the other members of
their support. The operatic couple, Bradford
and Russo, are back again, and so are the
gladiatorial Achilles and Newman. Hetty
King is looming amongst the remarks about
new arrivals made in the programme.
* * $
Some debt seems due to “The Amazons”
by the producer of “Senorita,” showing at
Sydney Lyceum in conjunction with “Million-
aires” ; but in the main it is a burlesque
upon the makers of “stunt” pictures. Bebe
Daniels is the daughter of a Spanish gran-
dee who was determined not to be disap-
pointed when the Stork left a girl; the fact
that the “hero” does Douglas Fairbanks
devilry in the Douglas Fairbanks spirit
makes the exploits all the more laughable.
“Millionaires” would have been improved if
the sentimental touches had been left out.
The feud between “The Callahans and the
Murphys,” neighbors in a. New York alley,
is a packet of boisterous humor which Hoyt’s
is screening. “False Shame” has run into
its fifth week at the Adyar Hall; but both
the Prince Edward and the Crystal Palace
change their long-distance bills this week.
“The Flag Lieutenant” is to open with a
gala night at the former to-morrow; the
other house will be the venue of “The
Seventh Heaven” from Saturday onward.
* * * *
An ambitious lady who won’t take care:—
Although at present Mary Edwards leaps ahead of
her technique, the exhibition of her pictures at the
Fine Art Gallery, Boomerang House, King-street,
Sydney, shows imagination and originality. In the “In
Memoriam” picture the artist makes the Cenotaph
in Martin-place a lopsided affair, and the building
in the background doesn’t really look like the
Sydney G.P.0., yet there is a subtly conveyed sense
of bigness and movement and the same applies to
“Sunday Morning.” A really delightful study is
“In the Land of Nod,” the picture of a small Chinese
child who has tumbled asleep with his playthings
around him.
On Saturday night Melbourne went to the
Royal to look at Marie Burke in “The
Whole Town’s Talking,” a farce in three
acts and one room by the hitherto highly
entertaining Anita Loos, authoress of that
thoughtful work, “Gentlemen Prefer Blondes.”
In case she may not have been recognised,
Marie Burke is the tall musicomedy star of
the vivid manner and the Andalusian face
who made “Wildflower” a bloom some people
still keep pressed in the book of pleasant
memories. The audience on Saturday, con-
fronted by a Miss Burke without music,
displayed all the enthusiasm of a party of
tourists brought to view a waterless Niagara,
or a roomful of electors introduced to a
wordless politician. Nor was their enthusi-
asm exactly doubled by the fact that the
banquet at which Miss Burke was to be
served plain proved to be a feeble mid-Vic-
torian farce concerning Chester Binney, a
rural manufacturer in Britain who has a
past manufactured for him by his partner
Simmons, so that the partner’s daughter,
Ethel, who likes her men against an amorous
background, will accept him for a husband.
After the claims of the Mona Lisa and the
Queen of Frumania have been considered.
Norma Lythe, a famous film star, is selected
to provide the past, and she inadvertently
arrives to discover that her alleged affair
with Chester Binney is the subject of the
whole town’s conversation.
* * * *
Chester Binney begins by being a dreary
and uninteresting ass, and for the rest of
his development remains perfectly consistent
with his start. Barrett-Lennard plays the
part sincerely. Marie Burke is his manu-
factured past. Thelma Burness equips the
role of his projected wife with some reason-
ably pleasant graces, ltosie La Varde pro-
vides Miss Burness with a plump and placid
ma, and George Blunt supplies her with a
rotund, rowdy and hard-working pa. Ley-
land Hodgson is another synthetic product
of the spotlight and the orchestra, who puts
into his portrait of a madly jealous director
of moving pictures as much atmosphere as is
commonly to be found at the bottom of a
river. There was one occasion when the
audience burst into laughter, long, loud and
unrestrained. George Blunt had just bel-
lowed “Suffering cats!” In the silence that
followed, the famous Theatre Royal feline
crept out of a box and walked serenely
across the stage. The management would be
well advised to put the animal on a salary
and retain its services for the currency of
the present piece.
* * * *
“Liliom,” the offering of the Melbourne
Repertorians at the King’s on Saturday, can
hardly be regarded as a serious contribution
to the intellectual drama. It is more like a
Methodist Sunday-school tract, humorlessly
stated in teiuns of the theatre. The objec-
tion that it is blasphemous doesn’t lie, but
it is just the sort of stuff the repertory move-
ment loves to shove down the public’s throat
and then call it names for refusing to swal-
low the dose. The cast treated the thing
far better than it deserved. Norman Simp-
son, as the polygamous Hungarian Sentimen-
tal Bloke, who is converted to the one-man-
one-woman system when his Doreen announ-
ces the imminent arrival of a baby, scored a
gloomy tragical success. His miserable little
drudge, crushed and maimed from birth, was
perfectly portrayed by Isabel Handley.
Marie, the stout servant girl, was admirably
reported by Myra Williams, who has some
valuable inflections in her voice not possessed
by any of the others. As Ficsur, the melo-
dramatic crook, Leo Burke maintained a
posture indicating severe spinal curvature
for commendably long periods. Messrs.
Lillie and McDonald were two tedious mem-
bers of the low-comedy branch of the Buda-
Pesth constabulary, and Betty Rae was an
effective Mme. Muscat, who became inco-
herent when excited. Producer G. McMahon
did his best to lift the audience out of its
low spirits by introducing farce, but farce is
not a permissible substitute for humor in a
repertory performance.
* * * *
Amateur grand opera will vacate Mel-
bourne Princess to-morrow, and the profes-
sional variety will begin on Saturday with
“Rigoletto.” Count Ercole Filippini will give
his voice and an aroma of aristocracy to the
leading role, and an Italo-Australian com-
pany will show what they can do to Verdi.
“Cavalleria Rusticana,” “II Trovatore,”
“Lucia,” “I Pagliacci,” “La Traviata,”
“Carmen” and “Faust” will follow with the
usual bewildering rapidity. The pleasant and
apocryphal “Madame Pomp.” is still in resi-
dence at His Majesty’s, and “The Last Warn-
ing” is still as rich in mystery and deficient
in comedy as ever at the Athenmum. If
Field Fisher’s voice holds out, the enterprise
of “Getting Gertie’s Garter” should fetch
the loud laugh that bespeaks the untenanted
upper storey for some further weeks at the
Palace. In the world of celluloid three
sessions daily are barely sufficient for the
needs of the Auditorium, where the Aus-
tralian film, now affectionately known as
“The Term,” is being shown.
King and Benson, who arrived on Satur-
day, are raising their average voices in an
average manner at Melbourne Tivoli. The
colored Emperors of Harmony, alias four
dark noises of considerable charm, warped
in on Monday. George Carney, the English
comedian, whom Sydney liked, is reported off
Gabo, and is expected alongside the foot-
lights about the time this paper goes to
press.

Low ton-mile costs
mean profit-earning miles
Thousands of Republic owners throughout Australia have
learned by actual experience that Republic provides the lowest
ton-mile costs in the truck world to-day. Economical running—
freedom from care and trouble —and its long life —make Republic
far more profitable than any other truck you know.
Ask your local dealer to show you how Republic is designed and
built to save you money. Note the powerful rear axle, all
enclosed in oil —the refined full-pressure lubrication, the famous
drive-shaft brake, the indispensable air cleaner. Mark the rugged
construction that enables Republic to make good under every
condition everywhere. And remember that there is a model to
meet your haulage requirements—built by the world’s largest
exclusive truck manufacturers.
Your local dealer will gladly demonstrate at any time to suit you.

The Germans unwittingly supplied the first
part of the fine “Zeebrugge” film, now inter-
esting Melbourne Majestic patrons. A sub-
marine heaves up its slimy length, like a
slow and brooding whale, spouts sudden death,
and a fore-and-aft schooner turns over and
goes to a watery grave; or a big steamer
settles in its tracks. Then a dinghy pushes
out from the submarine and makes a per
functory search for survivors. These realistic
scenes are not the usual counterfeit produc-
tions of the studio but the genuine thing,
taken by the U-boat crews themselves, and
Fate played an ironic jest on the Kaiser’s
crowd when the British Navy captured them.
The striking introduction gives point to the
tornado of imitation shot and shell which
breaks out on the screen later, when the
pirate nest is raided. This is the most
successful effort to recreate a war incident
to date. The spectator is one moment given
a bird’s-eye view of the operation; the next
lie is in the German batteries, and anon
he is with the British motor-boats, laying a
smoke-screen across the path of the attacking
fleet.
The best way for an elderly critic to look
at a circus is to turn round and look at the
kids. Accepting this criterion, Wirths’ show
at Olympia this year is pretty well what is
claimed for it, even if some of the animals
enumerated only appear in the pages of the
souvenir magazine. The dwarf is more of an
attraction than the giant, presumably be-
cause it would take three times the dwarf to
make an ordinary citizen, whereas the giant
isn't three times taller than his average col-
leagues. Also the bear, which swears out-
rageously before consenting to mount a velo-
cipede, is more impressive than the one that
climbs into the saddle with the docility and
leisureliness of a messenger boy with an
urgent telegram. Likewise, the lady all in gold
and the golden-tinted horse are a more pleas-
ing item than the reluctant lion that goes
for a ride on the elephant. Redam, who
supports a family of well-nourished girls on
his migratory muscles, is a powerful favor-
ite; and so is the elegant Miss Doris, who
keeps 200 tons of elephant in perpetual
motion by the might of her mild eye. There
is also a gent, who slides down a wire on
his self-sacrificing head.
A Melbourne Art haggis:—
There is an air of the waxworks about Miss Thea
Proctor’s endeavors to depict real life despite the
rare proficiency she has shown in the art of decorat-
ing fans. In her show at the New Gallery there are
some notable exceptions, however. In her portrait
of Schrimati Hu Rinini Arundale, the passivity of
the Oriental meets the quiescence of the artist’s
style half-way and they combine in a satisfactory
manner. Also the snub-nosed girl who looks audaci-
ously out of No. 22 has the vital spark. But the
girl opposite, partly in a tub and partly in a
chemise, who is vainly attempting to wash the
rheumatism out of her knees, and the bowls of
flowers, and the sundry other ladies in white hats,
purple shawls and the like only serve to demonstrate
that Miss Proctor, like the people who tortured
Galileo, believes that the world is flat.
Melbourne’s re-arisen Town Hall expects to com-
plete itself by the middle of December. The
new concert chamber is nearly half as large
again as the old one and looks as if it
could lose the largest voice and make the fattest
prima donna feel like a motor mascot. Twenty-one
panels have been faced with Celotex, the sugar-cane
fibre which is claimed to have valuable acoustic
properties, and these, Napier Waller, the one-armed
Digger mural painter, who executed the Menzies’
Hotel frescoes, has been commissioned to decorate
with his classic figures. Color destroys the
sound-amplifying powers of Celotex, so the
paintings are really sepia drawings, with a touch
of blue about the skies. Waller has a flair for
gracious rhythms, but the details show signs of
haste and strain, and some of the goddesses and
heroes will probably have their anatomy severely
criticised. The city fathers apparently expect an
artist to work as rapidly as a kalsominer, which is
possibly one reason why there isn’t something more
specially Australian than St. George destroying the
dragon —Queensland vanquishing the prickly-pear or
Mr. Tunnecliffe smashing a railway union, for
instance.
At the Prince of Wales, Muriel Starr has
been staging the emotional “Madame X.”
Harvey Adams produced and figured in two
character sketches. His Laroque was a
dandy adventurer in wonderful trousers, and
his Valmorin a public prosecutor with a
really admirable delivery. In addition, Carl
Lawson was excellent as the husband.
Floriot, and Frank Leighton made an engag-
ing young advocate. But it was Muriel Starr
who held the audience throughout. The
Robert Roberts Revue Company, at the
Majestic Theatre, is a refreshingly good
show with some new sketches, original patter
and capital song?! At West’s Pictures.
“Private Izzy Murphy” shows how a Jewish
boy may develop into a fighting Irishman.
“The Cradle Snatchers” opened at the Royal

NNIPPER BLOGGS: “You will be running for a couple of days, of course?”
SUPERBUS BEERBOHM (on tour) : “Oh no, we are only playing to-night.”
BLOGGS: “Yes — but you will be running to-morrow.”
“Hamfat”: Marie Lohr has divorced her
husband, Anthony Leyland Yal Prinsep, with
whom she went into management at the
Globe Theatre in 1918. Margaret Banner-
man, cited as co-re., married Pat Somerset,
whom she divorced. Marie is an Australian,
daughter of Kate Bishop and “Daddy” Lohr,
both now dead. Her first appearance was as
a child of four in “The World Against Her.
Her talent as a child actress helped Charles
Arnold to make “Hans the Boatman" suc-
cessful, besides getting her an immediate
place in the theatrical world in England
when, in 1801, she went there as a girl of
11. She has not since found time to return
to her native land.
“L. de It.”: Not satisfied with reviving
one of her own successes, Nellie Stewart is
going to have a shot at a success of some-
body else. The Firm is arranging for her
to appear in “Romance” in Melbourne at
Christmas. If the indomitable Nellie makes
a do of it she will achieve something remark-
able. A good half of the success of her
recent seasons in Sydney and Melbourne was
due to sentimental associations in the
public’s memory between herself and the
hoyden who sold an orange to a king at
Drury-lane. In “Romance” she will have to
stand comparisons with Madge Fabian, who
gave a brilliant performance of the singer
with tbe grouch against Adelina Patti.
“Hamfat” : Sydney Empire has freed itself
from the fetich of the Saturday-niglit open-
ing, which dates from old days when a good
house was certain only on Saturday.
Hardly any show can go wrong on Saturday
nowadays, and by week-niglit openings the
Empire people assure themselves of an extra
big night in one week. On the few occasions
the Firm has tried the plan success has
followed ; it is surprising that the old prac-
tice persists.
“Caesar’s Ghost”: The revenue-producing
“On Our Selection” is on the roads again
in N.S.W., Litligow, Bathurst and Orange
being the first three stops. Bert Bailey,
who has some other fish to fry, handed the
part of Dad to Barney Egan, a competent
actor who was with Eytton’s country shows.
“Cauboy”: “Baby Mine,” which Nellie
Bramley has put on in Sydney, is not a new
play ; the piece was staged 11 years ago in
Sydney Criterion with Bob Grieg (now in
U.S.A.) as the leading man and his wife,
Beatrice Holloway, as the star. In its
original shape it was little more than a cur-
tain-raiser, but, by starting late and repeating
the overture until the house showed a ten-
dency to throw things, the stage-manager
kept it going till a few minutes after ten.
It flopped in a fortnight, but reappeared at
Melbourne Tivoli —with much the same
result.
“Crojack”: The situation in which the
Commonwealth Band found itself in the
United States does not amaze Americans,
who are used to the strong methods of the
Musicians’ Federation. Even a charity per-
formance does not escape the eagle eyes of
the union delegate. A band or individual
musicians may give their services free for
the evening, but the union boss will roll
along with a pianist tucked under his arm.
When the position is explained to him lie will
nod his head and say, “Sure, fine? But
just to keep things square, you must pay
one man the union wage, the pianist—and
I’ve got one for you, right here.” The
pianist never plays a note, but he is paid, all
the same.
“L. de Rideau” : Is this a record for the
sex? Betty Ross Clarke, who arrived a
year ago in Australia as the fly Cornish lass
of “The Ghost Train,” is making for Perth,
there to produce six new plays in six weeks.
After Groperland has sampled them the half-
dozen will be transported east. Phyllis
Millingen, Warde Morgan, Eric Harrison
(who was with Emelie l’olini in “The Lie”)
and Fred Patey are to assist.
“C. 8.” : Keith Barry’s inquiry as to who
is Melba’s successor gets an answer from
Thomas Beecham: “Florence Austral is the
world’s finest dramatic soprano,” says the
conductor, as recorded in a cable. By loos-
ing the Melbourne singer on Lunnon in an
entirely Wagnerian programme Beecham
confirms the opinion of some few Sydney
critics who five or six years ago ventured to
announce her as the greatest Wagner expo-
nent living. Europe took a long time to
make the same discovery, for Florence rang
its doorbell in vain shortly after, although
her voice then was as mature as her figure is
to-day.
“C. 8.”: Joseph Hislop was warbling his
way through a grand-opera programme in
Melbourne when word came from King
George that he approved of a knighthood
conferred on the Scotch tenor by the King of
Sweden. That cable was as opportune as
the one Dion Boucicault got when he was
orating before the curtain in Melbourne on
the first night of his last season, lie was
just informing his listeners that lie felt
iiis wife, Irene Vanbrugh, was thinking of
them, when a hand rushed on with a cable
from the lady. These harmless little monkey-
shines always get the crowd.
“C. Ockney”: Joe Coyne didn’t take up
his part in the London production of “Oh,
Kay” after all. He contracted to play
it without reading the script and found, on
perusal, that it didn’t suit him. So Joseph re-
tired to make room for Australia’s John Kirby,
who at the present time is the most sought-
after comedian in London.
“Goldilocks”: With Marie Burke in “The
Whole Town’s Talking” will be Mary Ander-
son, daughter of William Anderson, of good
old Bilanderson Melodrama. Anderson started
as a billposter in Bendigo. He made a con-
siderable fortune from theatrical manage-
ments, and has recently been running shows
in Adelaide after a long retirement. His
wife, Eugenie, a member of the Duggan
family, won wide popularity as the distressed
heroine of many pieces.
“iCauboy”: The arrival of “The Flag
Lieutenant” as a picture recalls that the play
had its first Australian showing at Her
Majesty’s, Sydney, on July 24, 1909. Thomas
Kingston was the flag lieutenant; G. b.
Titlieradge was a magnificent old Admiral;
and Dion Titlieradge, Gregan McMahon,
Ethel Warwick and Emma Temple were in
the show.
“Goldilocks”: Frank Neil is the first in
Australia to think of a show entirely for
children. He has Sydney Opera House
booked for Christmas, and intends running
comedy-drama at night and panto., designed
for youngsters, in the afternoons. A similar
idea, without waiting for Christmas, is being
given a run in London. There, two young
actresses, Agnes Lowson and Joan Luxton,
have headed a movement for afternoon the-
atrical shows for children to wean them
from the cinema.
“Film Up”: The attempt by the Holly-
wood movie mandarins to cut down the sa.a-
ries of their stars was a fizzle. Meetings of
protest were held bv the mummers and the
aid of the Actors’ Equity was invoked. The
upshot was that work at all the studios
was carried on for some time under strike
conditions and many films were spoiled.
The stars will now finish their contracts
at their old salaries, which, by the way,
are only about half what the managers
press-agents make them out to be.
“R.Iv.D.N.” : Elsie Janis, one of America's
real stars —her name has been on the electric
signs for a quarter of a century—is coming
to Australia shortly. She is singer, daucer.
impersonator, revue-artist, revue-writer —in
fact, the whole show. If she lives up to her
reputation she should convince Australian
audiences that there is High Art even in the
song-and-dance business. But it is a pity she
couldn’t have come earlier.
THE MANAGER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“He was my manager,” said Joe,
"The time I did my money in
Over that Constellation show.”
“And I,” said Peter, with a grin,
“Was in that show with him and you.
A decent chap was Jimmy, too.”
“He was,” said Joe. “Because my cash
Ran out I do not blame old Jim.
And after I had done my dash
I got a good few bob from him.
He wasn’t busted by the show,
Being the manager,” said Joe.
“It was a crash,” old Peter mused.
“We all got broke and down and out,
The ghost so constantly refused
To walk. But Jim could always shout
If we felt like a drink or so.”
“He was the manager,” said Joe.
“Ten quid a week was all his screw,
But somehow Jim has got ahead,
And hands out jobs to me and ydu.
But he’s a decent chap,” Joe said.
“It cost me all I had, that show—
lie was my manager,” said Joe.

Read how Alemite Lubrication will
prevent 80% of your repair bills
You know about the importance of keeping
your engine supplied with oil, your tyres with
air and your radiator with water.
But what about the fourth point —the proper
lubrication of your chassis bearings?
Do you know that neglected or improper lubri-
cation of these 20 to 60 hard-working dust-ex-
posed chassis bearings is the cause of 80% of
repairs to motor cars? This is a fact that has
been proved conclusively by the records of
thousands of service stations.
Alemite System makes
lubrication easy
With the old-fashioned method of lubrication
by means of grease cups, the lubrication of
chassis bearings was so difficult and messy a
job that motorists neglected it. Today with
Alemite every chassis bearing can be lubri-
cated easily in a few minutes.
In addition, the old method did not insure
positive lubrication of the bearings, while the
Alemite method does. That’s why it is used to-
day on more than 10,000,000 motor cars.
Equip your car with Alemite
at small cost
If your car is already equipped with the Ale-
mite High Pressure Lubrication System, use it
every 500 miles, or have your service station
man do the work for you.
If your car is not equipped you can have Ale-
mite fittings installed in place of grease cups
quickly and at a surprisingly low cost. A fit-
ting that costs a few pennies will save a bear-
ing worth many pounds.
How Alemite works
To lubricate with Alemite you merely attach
the handy Alemite compressor gun to the fit-
ting on each bearing. A twist of the wrist forces
clean, fresh lubricant entirely through the bear-
ing, forcing out the worn-out, gritty grease at
the same time.
Use Alemite every 500 miles and cut down
your repair bills. You’ll also have an easier rid-
ing car, a more dependable and longer lived car.
If your regular service station does not carry
Alemite fittings or any of the Alemite Pro-
ducts shown at the left, write us and we will
see that you are supplied.

The Oldest Land.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I.
FOR centuries ere Rome liad found a
name
Or Greece had set her first clear lamp
alight
In dreaming Thessaly or on some height
Of windy Crete, the mellow evening came
With such soft steps, hiding from sunset’s
flame
In this deep shadow; and tall tree-steins
white
Stood, as these trees stand, sheltering the
weak flight
Of flitting birds a fearless dusk made tame.
No vaunting armies scourged this quiet land.
No wailing women from a tortured town
Watered this earth with unavailing
tears.
Only the eager seasons, hand in hand,
Dancing in blue and silver, gold and
brown,
Heard the shrill music of the passing
years.
11.
Here where a mighty root has raised a
stone,
Its sappy sinews twisted in the strain,
And tiie brown boughs above feeling the
pain
Of the great deed, was dead strength over-
thrown
By the high lust to live. The trumpets
blown
On all the winds and the wild rush of
rain
Wrought a slow ruin into some green
gain
Of ampler woods and branches fairer grown.
So slowly and so mightily they strove,
These green battalions of ten thousand
hills,
That all the little records of man’s
hand—
The beaten iron and the stricken grove,
The golden city broken by its ills —-
Seem but as faint words scrawled on
alien sand.
111.
A new land this, the passing voices say,
While the scarred crags frown in disdain-
ful power.
New! Yonder is a stem that breaks in
flower
With such an ancestry that time grows
grey
In thinking back to find the strange far day
When first it. lifted to the sun and shower
Its scent and bloom. This ragged sand-
stone tower
Has held a million years of change at bay.
The white scars on the bushland all are new;
But this brown soil, which in our kindling
springs
Gives promise of the harvest, is so
old
With magic of the sun and wind and dew
That upstart valleys of forgotten kings
Yield homage to the patriarch fields
we hold.
IV.
Far in the north a shining British plough
Makes furrows o’er the graves of nameless
sires.
There industry has built its roaring fires
Where once the oakleaves crowmed a Druid
brow.
The hard-fought battle and the churchman’s
vow
Cling to old ruins choked with thorns and
briers.
But here our morning fills with new
desires —
To-morrow’s glory from the earnest Now.
Most ancient land of this wide turning
sphere,
You dreamt so long beneath your lonely
skies
That dreams are of your nature. Oh,
your race
Should dream with that strong purpose and
no fear
Which as a heritage of deeds shall rise
For those who read Australia’s patient
face!

DAVID MCVID MCKEE WEIGHT.
The Executioner.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
MR. THOMAS BIRDSEYE was, in the
estimation of those who knew him
intimately, a very likeable man.
Sydney was not a large place in the days
when Lieut.-General Sir Richard Bourke was
Governor-General of Australia, and its in-
habitants were better acquainted with one
another than they are now, had more in-
terests in common, and were able to recog-
nise in fellow citizens both virtues and
shortcomings with a greater degree of
accuracy and fairness than it is possible
that the million or so of human beings
clustering about Port Jackson could to-day.
They lived closer together, wrnre more acces-
sible to one another, and shared more fully
in their mutual ups and downs.
Thus, if Mrs. Milligan on the Rocks had
a baby Mrs. Doolittle of the Haymarket
would come to hear of it speedily enough
by word of mouth, would take an interest in
the infant and most likely walk across to
have a look at it. If Bill Harris of Wool-
loomooloo got drunk, and was confined in the
stocks for a period, the news would be quite
entertaining to Dick Spittle on the Darling
Harbor side. Or if Captain Westmacott,
the Governor’s A.D.C., bought a new horse,
all Sydney would take a friendly interest in
the price he paid for it. Little things like
that. The town was an intimate place,
where everybody knew everybody else’s busi-
ness. Hardly anything was done in it that
did not evoke the criticism—kindly, candid,
or hostile —of all who dwelt along the valley
of the Tank Stream. And public characters
were very much more public than they are,
these ninety-odd years afterwards. Beyond
what we read of a Minister of the Crown in
the newspapers, for instance, we do not know
much about him otherwise. In those days
anybody would have known whether he was
a "good fellow personally or not, lived at
peace with his wife, or the reverse, and just
about how solvent he was, or otherwise.
Mr. Birdseye was a public character and all
Sydney knew all about him.
His wms an office that has never been so
popular as it might be. Through all the
ages the final executants of the law’s decrees
have incurred an odium which, properly re-
garded, should rather be the portion of those
who make the laws than of the humble in-
struments of authority who carrv them out.
The headsman and the hangman have always
been put, by common consent, in a class of
their own which has been regarded as vile,
debased and execrable. Decent people look
down upon its members; those who are not
decent revile them and fear them. A man
may have every good quality, but let him
but occupy the useful office of sheriff's right
hand man and he is immediately shunned
by society, and treated as though he were a
pariah dog. It is only the sheriff who
recognises his true worth. He alone will
grieve over his demise.
Tom Birdseye, of Essex-lane, jovial, kindly
hearty hangman of Sydney from 1830 tc
1845, was an exception to this rule. Nobodj
in the town regarded him as a pariah; no
body felt contaminated by his presence, oi
resented his existence. Among his social
equals he was regarded as a desirabh
acquaintance. Many reckoned him a true
hearted, liberal-handed friend. Even thosi
who had reason to be apprehensive of one
day having to undergo professional treatment
at his hands did not look upon him as the
embodiment of the final and inevitable
Terror. When they did come into his hands
they found his gentleness and kindliness
quite as consoling as the ministrations of
priest or parson. A single anecdote of the
many that have come down concerning him
—though they are all pretty generally for
gotten now—well illustrates the sort of man
he was.
When he went into the condemned cell to
pinion Peter Mulcahey, the monstrous and
uncouth survivor of the wreck of the brig
Woodbine upon Flinders Island, down in Bass
Strait he had killed and eaten the only other
two members of the crew—the ruffianly black-
guard had broken Mr. Birdseye’s nose with a
blow of the fist. All the way to the gallows, to
the admiration of those who heard him. the
kindly and forgiving Mr. Birdseye had not
ceased seeking to comfort this dreadful crea-
ture who was about to pollute Perdition.
“There, there, my poor fellow,” he continued
repeating in a soothing tone, whilst the blood
trickled down over his mouth and chin, and
his nose kept on swelling and turning purple.
“There, there—be calm, my lad, be calm. I
won’t hurt you, I wrnn’t hurt you. ’Tis
nothing at all. Nothing at all. You’ll be dead
in half o’ no time.” And when the blasphem-
ing wretch fell through the drop, and hung
quivering convulsively at the end of the
rope, Mr. Birdseye leaned over the rectangular
aperture of the open trapdoors and re-
marked with kindly forgiveness, “Rest in
peace, poor man—rest in peace! I know
you didn’t mean it.”
Is it to be wondered at that such a char-
acter commanded the respect of all who knew
him? And everybody knew him in Sydney
in 1834.
His cottage in Essex-lane reflected the real
refinement of th e man, rough sailor before
the mast though he had been before Mr.
Sheriff Meiklejohn induced him to take up
his present occupation. Its pretty garden
was the pride of the Rocks, his two pretty
and virtuous daughters were the pride of
Sydney. One of them, Celia, married the
wealthy Peter Crossways, proprietor of the
Travellers’ Delight, that excellent Blue
Mountain posting-house on the Bathurst
road. The other, the truly lovely Janet, with
her Devonshire complexion, wide blue eyes
and tawny hair, became the wife of no less
a personage than Mr. Assistant-Surveyor
Troopley, Sir Thomas Mitchell's most trusted
subordinate in the Surveyor-General's De-
partment. When passers-by beheld these
two splendid specimens of Currency lasses
working amongst the carnations and roses
that were the glory of the Bird’s Nest —as
Mr. Birdseye had humorously named his
dwelling-place—they would pause in admira-
tion of so much human and horticultural
beauty gathered together in the one spot,
and pass along about their business full of
increased respect for the worthy man their
father, reflecting wonderingly how strange it
was that he should almost dignify and en-
noble the grim office which he filled with so
much efficiency and with such satisfaction
to that somewhat finicky and exacting per-
sonage, Mr. Frederick William Meiklejohn.
* * * *
In the thirties of the last century there
existed in Sydney a pleasant and sociable
little club which well described itself by its
title of the Merry Jokers. Once a week, on
Saturday evenings, its members gathered
together at Toby Gilshinnan’s Harp and
Shamrock Inn, at the George-street end of
Hunter-street, for purposes of goodfellow-
ship and the edification of their souls by
means of harmony, alcohol and social inter-
course. It was not such an exclusive insti-
tution as the newly formed Australian Club,
which would possibly not have admitted the
hangman to membership—though the Judges
were members—but it had many good points.
Prisoners of the Crown, for instance, were
ineligible to join in its gatherings, even if
they were the possessors of tickets-of-leave.
And no man might continue on its roll who
could not sing a good song, tell a good story
or entertain his fellows by performing upon
some musical instrument or other.
Mr. Birdseye was a member of this select
assembly and by no means the least
popular member. His arrival was always
eagerly looked for at the end of any week
in which he might have been called upon to
discharge the functions of his office under
Government. The droller side of these occa-

THE PERFECTLY BALANCED FIRST-AID
sions always appealed to him, and lie could
be thoroughly relied - upon to retail, with
good-natured humor, anything funny that
had come under his notice during his most
recent launching into eternity of one or more
of his fellow-creatures. There was the
story, for instance, of the demise of Tommy
Quartpot, the half-witted half-caste, whose
career came to a sudden end one morning
on account of his having borrowed a horse
at Cook’s River which he forgot did not
belong to him, and sold in Campbelltown.
“Ye’d lia’ died a-laflin’,” he told them.
“W’en I goes into th’ cell for to tie Tommy
hup, I finds him werry hexcited like. He’d
bin hexpectin’ a re-prieve—on liaccount o’
bein’, as you might say, a sheet o’ bark
loose. Right hup to tli’ larst Tommy was
convinced in his liown mind that I wouldn’t
'ave to turn ’im liorf. O’ course, I knows—
Mr. Meiklejolin ’ad tole me—’e didn’t ’ave a
lieartlily, but w’en ’e says to me, ‘Tom, ole
man—ye think th’ Gov’nor’s liord’ly’ll fetch
it to tli’ foot o’ th’ gallus, don’t ye?’ well,
wot could I do but tell ’im ’twas th’ werry
likeliest thing that might ’appen? No use
a-takin’ away from th’ pore fellie ’is larst
bit of ’ope. ’Twould pleasure ’im for to
’ave it to tli’ hend, an’ do ’arm to nobody.
An’ then, w’en I ’as ’im a-standin’ hup on
tli’ drop, all fixed hup to mike ’is passage
to th’ nex’ world, blime if one o’ them Gov’-
ment ’Ouse ord’lies don’t ride hup on th’
hedge o’ th’ crowd an’ sit there on ’is ’orse
a-lookin’ lion. ‘There ’e is, Tom,’ says
Quartpot—‘ ’tis all right now, you can let
me down.’ Mr. Meiklejolin gives tli’ signal
with ’is walkin’-stick, just as ’e says it, so
I says—‘Right you are, Tommy!’ pulls tli’
white cap down over ’is dial an’ lets ’im
down.”
The funniness of any little incident of this
sort was never lost upon Tom Birdseye, nor
did he ever forget to relate it to his fellow-
members at the club. Little wonder that
they regarded him as a veritable prince of
raconteurs, or that his popularity became a
fixed and stable quantity. His reputation as
a wag stood very high indeed.
Just as the dawn was breaking one Sun-
day morning in the month of December,
1834, Mr. Birdseye left the Harp and Sham-
rock after one of its jovial weekly meetings,
with the intention of proceeding homeward
to Essex-lane. He had fallen asleep in the
small hours, perhaps a little overcome by
fatigue, or the potency of Toby Gilshinnan’s
liquid refreshments, and when he woke up
it was to a realisation of the fact that all
his boon companions had departed and that
he alone remained in the taproom. Mr. Gil-
shinnan was snoring loudly in the adjacent
bar, and the front door of the house stood
wide open.
As Tom stood upon the doorstep, inhaling
restoring draughts of the life-giving fresh
air of early morning and realising that pos-
sibly he had imbibed a little too much during
the evening, he became aware of a com-
motion that was approaching up the hill of
Hunter-street, from the direction of Pitt-
street and the Tank Stream—a shouting,
yelling mob of drunken and belated roy-
sterers preceded by a howling, yelping, fleeing
dog with a tin attached to his tail.
Instantly the sight of this senseless cruelty
to a dumb animal roused him to fury and
resentment. His kindly nature could not
tolerate this savagery, and wanton in-
humanity of such a sort was entirely loath-
some to him: He stepped out into the road
as the terrified mongrel sped past him round
the corner into George-street, and waited for
the leader of the miserable rag-tag who were
persecuting the unfortunate dog. When the
fellow came level with him Tom measured
his distance and smote him in the jaw, with
such effectiveness that he rolled in the gutter
and lay there unconscious. It had been a
lucky blow, perhaps, but it put a stop to
the hunt.
“I’ll give any o' tli’ rest o’ ye the same hif
ye wants it!” he shouted. “Ye flamin’ pack o’
warmints. An’ if liany one o’ ye—or th’ whole
bilin’ —comes into my ’ands at liany time to
come, I’ll make ye suffer worser’n wot ye’ve
made that pore ’elpless animal for to suffer.
By Gawd, I will!”
Mr. Birdseye’s intervention was so unex-
pected, and his personality so well known
to them, that possibly the “sportsmen” were
a little overawed. At any rate, with a few
half-heartedly ribald remarks they slunk
away. Mr. Birdseye took a look at the vic-
tim of his vengeance, who did not show signs
of coming to—a fact which gave him little
concern—when he recognised the fellow as a
neighbor.
“Huh!” he grunted disgustedly. “ ’Tis you,
Bill Makepeace, is it? Th’ sort o’ thing a
man’d be a-lookin for from such a blaggard.
Ye’re not content with beatin’ y’r missus—ye
must haet like a devil to pore dumb dorgs.
Well, lie there, ye scum—he there; I’m for
home. ’Tis time a fellie was in bed,” he said,
as he pulled out his watch and consulted it
—“ ’tis ha’-past four. I must get in afore
th’ gals wake hup!”
So he hurried away in the direction of his
dwelling, paying no further attention to the
man in the gutter.
It was noon before Mr. Birdseye was
awakened by his daughter Janet, bearing in
her hands a tray, on which were a cup of
strong coffee, a bottle of rum and a glass.
He rose upon his elbow, and blinked at the
pretty creature, as she deposited her burden
upon a chair by his bedside.
“Thankee, my gal—thankee. ’Tis wot I
wants. Th’ club sat late last night. ’Twas
after midnight afore we hadjourned. An’
what’s th’ best noos this Sabbath morn, lil
Janey?” he inquired affectionately of the girl.
“Bless my ole ’eart. you looks as fresh as a
dysy—s’elp me, ye does. Jes’ like y’r mother
used w’en first I went a-coortin’ ’er—Gawd
rest ’er soul! What be you two a-goin’ for
to do to-day? ’Ow’d ye like a sail on th’
’arbor this afternoon—to Watson’s Bay, or
somew’eres? W’y, wot’s th’ matter, me gal—
ye’re all of a tremble!”
“Oh, fe.vther,” the girl replied excitedly,
“there do be a fearsome thing has happened
next door. Tur’ble, tur'ble!”
“Nex’ door? Wot—'as Mrs. Carmody ’ad
twins again?”
“No, no—on the other side. Mrs. Make-
peace—she’s been a-murthered. Choked to
death wi’ a bit o’ clo’es-line. An’ th’ con-
stables, they’ve coorn an’ took Bill Make-
peace to th’ police-office an’ charged him wi’
th’ job. Tur'ble, dad, ain’t it?”
Mr. Birdseye sat up in bed and poured
some rum into his eup of coffee. He re-
flected for a little while. Then he asked his
daughter a question.
“An* wot time might thishyer murder ha’
bin done—’as anybody got a notion'/”
“Yes. Our Celia she heard tli’ poor
woman’s dyin’ screams. Zeems as Celia
couldn’t sleep—her havin’ th’ toothache—an'
went into th’ kitchen, just after daylight, for
to get a clove to put in her holler tooth
what’s been a-troublin’ her this week past.
Sudden like she hears Carrie Makepeace
scream out, ‘Oh, Bill,’ she cries, ‘don’t go for
to do it. Bill! ’ And then she screams again—
liorrid-like—an’ then there’s a chokin’ sort of
noise that ends sudden. She looks at tlr
clock an’ it’s half after four. That must ha’
been th’ time ’twas done. Last night 1
heerd ’em quarrelling—an’ Bill calls out ‘Ye
wretch, I’ll do for ’ee afore marnin'.'
Oh, ain’t it tur’ble, feytlier? It dew make
my flesh for to creep all over.”
“But Bill warn’t there at ha’-parst fower.
I know that lie was down in Hunter A str”
he checked himself suddenly, and slapped his
knee with his hand—as one who remembers
something of importance. “Well, well, my
gal. Go see to tli’ dinner. That there Bill
Makepeace ain’t o’ no account. No doubt
I’ll lia’ to deal wi’ un over thishyer bus’ness.
H’m a main crool blaggard, an’ ’twill do him
good for to darnce hupon nowt, as they say.
Go you an’ see to tli’ dinner—an’ I’ll take
th’ both of you for a sail i’ tli’ harternoon.
No need for to trouble y'rselves about Bill
Makepeace.”
King William the Fourth versus William
Makepeace resulted very ill for the latter.
The Court held that undoubtedly he had
slain his wife soon after dawn on the morn-
ing of December the 6th, in the year of Our
Lord One-tliousand-eight-hundred-and-thirty-
four, and decreed that William the subject
should recompense William the King with his
life for the contempt lie had shown for the
laws and ordinances of the realm of which
the latter was the titular head. And his
Excellency the Governor of New South
Wales signed Bill Makepeace’s death-warrant
with little regret or compunction, the war-
rant having been so drawn up as to make it
certain that Bill would not spend another
Christmas upon this earth. He was to die
on the morning of Christmas Eve.
Mr. Birdseye had been in the court during
the trial, and had appeared to take a par-
ticular interest in the proceedings—a fact
which seemed peculiar to all who knew
him, since he usually made it a rule not to
display interest in prospective clients until
the time came for him to attend them pro-
fessionally. Such attentions began with a
cursory inspection of the condemned in the
exercise yard of the gaol in George-street,
a (lay or two before he had finally to deal
with them, so that he might arrive at a cor-
rect conclusion as to what length of rope it
would be necessary to use in order to make
certain of affording the victim of the law
a speedy passage into the next world. He
was held to regard it as a little “unprofes-
sional” to seem to take too much interest
beforehand in any particular case—some-
thing like an attorney touting for a client.
He was nothing if not strictly professional.
But on this occasion he had so far departed
from his rule as to permit himself to remark
in public:—
“Thishyer Bill—he ain't no good. I seen
’im meself a-chasin’ a dawg wi’ a tin tied
to un’s tail. ’E desarves ’is sentence.”
On the evening before Christmas Eve,
Mr. Birdseye, smoking a churchwarden pipe
in his verandah, was not a little surprised
to receive a visit from the Rev. John Joseph
Therry, who was at this time Roman
Catholic chaplain to the gaol. Though not
a member of the good priest’s flock, he knew
him well and respected him highly, as did
everyone in the community who had any
capacity for respect for thorough human
goodness and Christian charity. So he made
him heartily welcome.
“Sit ye down, y’r reverence, and will ye
not take a cup of tea? Me dafighter would
be proud to brew it for ye.”
Father Therry shook his head, but he took
the chair Mr. Birdseye offered him, and sat
down. There was a look of anxiety in his
thin face, and he spoke a little eagerly to the
liangpian,
“Look ye, Mr. Birdseye, you know that
man who is to come into your hands in the
morning—this William Makepeace?”
"O’ coorse, y’r rev’rence. W’y, ’e was me
right-’and neighbor ’ere this three year past.
A rare crool ’un—a bad man. I think he’s
on’y a-gettin’ wot ’e’s proper entitled to. A
bad man.”
“Me frind. ’tis the judgment of the
Almighty shall determine that, not we poor
sinners. Now this man—who’s one of me
flock —he’s told me an extraordinary thing
this afternoon. He says that at the time of
his having been supposed to murder his wife
he was lying unconscious as the result of
a blow dealt to him by yourself in Hunter-
street. He says that, if you’d but speak up,
you could save his life. Now, I beg you to
tell me. as truthfully as though you were
yourself arraigned before the Throne of Grace,
whether there may be anything in this
eleventh-hour tale of Makepeace’s. If there
is I am sure that the Governor would gran!
a respite until it could be inquired into. 1
would go myself now and ask him for it.
Come, Mr. Birdseye, in spite of your calling,
I know you to be an honest man. Tell me
—is there anything in it?”
Mr. Birdseye stood up and faced the
priest. He spoke impressively.
“Y’r rev’rence, not a word o’ truth. A
bad man. A man as’d tie a tin to a dog's
tail, an’ chase tli’ poor creature through th’
streets —wife-murder’d be nowt to ’un. Ye
can take it from me, y’r rev’rence—there's
nothing in it.”
Father Therry rose to go, and sighed as be
s'uiok hands with the excellent Mr. Birds-
eye.
“Ah, well,” he said, “I see I can do noth-
ing for him other than the ministrations of
the church. Good evening, Mr. Birdseye.
May he have an easy death!”
“I’ll see to that, y’r rev’rence.” said Mr.
Birdseye, feelingly. “Even though I’ve seen
him play th’ blaggard towards a ‘elpless dumb
animal. ’E’ll go heasy.”

The Romance of
The Australian Iron & Steel Industry.
Back in the early days of Australia, over a
hundred years ago, great excitement was caused
among the early settlers by the discovery of coal in
New South Wales.
Newcastle, or Coal Creek, as it was then
became the second settlement of the young colony.
The importance of the discovery was at once recog-
nised, and the deposits were quickly developed.
It was some years afterwards that the deposits of
iron ore were discovered. The first attempt at smelt-
ing iron ore was made in 1848 at Mittagong. It failed.
Twenty-seven years later, the first blast furnace
was blown in at Eskbank, in Lithgow Valley, New
South Wales.
Two years later the in-
fant works were producing
100 tons of pig iron per
week from iron ore taken
from the surrounding dis-
trict, Production continued
until 1882, over 4000 tons
being produced in that
year.
For some time the com-
pany had been in difficul-
ties owing to overseas im-
portations and the opposi-
tion of the hardware trade
in Sydney, and in 1886 Mr.
W. Sandford took over the
works.
For the next twenty-
one years they were con-
tinuously employed in the
manufacture of bar iron,
rails, and other iron and
steel products, imported
pig iron and local scrap
iron being used.
Mr. Sandford had a
very hard struggle, and in
1907 found himself unable
to continue. The works
were then acquired by
Messrs. G. and C. Hoskins,
under whose control they have been ever since.
The story of the early history of the iron and steel
industry is a story of continual struggle against great
and ever increasing odds.
It was impossible for these early ironfounders to
get the latest and best machinery. They could not
turn out a great variety of products, and were, con-
sequently, only able to supply a portion of local
requirements. The early settlers were, however, made
of stern stuff, and, just as the early agriculturists and
the early pastoralists stuck to the land and succeeded
in spite of every obstacle, so these early ironfounders
kept going, one after the other, allowing no defeat to
intimidate, no obstacle to daunt them.

NEWCASTLE STEEL WORKS.
In 1912 a fresh development took place when the
erection of the great steel works at Newcastle was
decided upon.
Large deposits of iron ore at Spencer Gulf, South
Australia, had been acquired. No coal was, however,
obtainable in the neighborhood, and the question
arose, whether it would be better to bring the coal
from Newcastle or to take the iron ore to the coal
district.
The fact that it takes three tons of coal to produce
one ton of steel quickly settled the question, and a
commencement was made with the erection of the
great steelworks in Port Waratah, Newcastle.
An area of 900 acres was secured with an exten-
sive water frontage. The
land was swampy and
cpuld only be regarded as
an eyesore to the neighbor-
hood. Piles had to be
driven to provide founda-
tions, the land had to be
drained, considerable fill-
ing in had to be done, but,
finally, all these troubles
being overcome, the first
blast furnace was blown in
on 9th April, 1915, and
the first rail was rolled on
24th April of that year.
Since that date the Aus-
tralian iron and steel indus-
try may be said to have
finally arrived. The estab-
lishment of the Newcastle
works, with the latest and
most up-to-date machinery,
encouraged engineers and
others to make much more
extensive use of locally-
produced iron and steel.
This greater use of Aus-
tralian iron reacted, in its
turn, on the works of other
Australian ironmasters.
With the greater demand
for their products, these
others were enabled to extend their plants and to
install up-to-date machinery in their works.
The establishment of the industry has already
been of outstanding benefit to Australia. Already
nearly 4,000,000 tons of iron and steel have been
produced at the Newcastle works alone.
Various subsidiary industries have been estab-
lished in or near Newcastle, for the production of Gal-
vanised Iron, Fencing Wire, Wire Netting, Road Tar,
Fire Bricks, Tyres and Axles, Structural Steel, Wire,
Ropes, and many other minor articles.
When it is remembered that alLthese are produced
entirely from Australian raw materials, the increase
to the wealth of Australia is incalculable.
“No Country can afford to be wholly dependent on outside sources
for a supply of a metal compared with which even gold may be
looked upon as of secondary importance.”-Au.trai» n commi,.*™ (Majority Report).
