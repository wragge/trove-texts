UNDER THE GUMTREE
The Devil’s Advo-
cateletkinling.
THE devil’s advocate dis-
charges an ancient,
an honored, and a
useful function ; and,
in respect of the new tribe
of poets, I have often
thought of playing devil’s
advocate myself. Local
insistence on their merits,
accented by sales —or
even unaccented by
sales—has been followed
by sporadic cases of
megalomania which one
would hate to see en-
demic. There was cer-
lainly room for a not-
too - friendly catalogue
of tacks and defects.
But, now that the dust
which Mr. Walter Mur-
doch kicked up in Melb.
Argus of 6th May has
subsided, it seems safe to
point out thatas a devil’s
advocate he does not
fill the boots. He
does not even fill the
shoes of the advoea-
telet. One has to
double diminutives,
1 before, with some
misgiving, it is de-
cided that he is loosely fitted with the bootees
of the devil’s advocateletkin.
If zeal were all the equipment needed for des-
troying this insolent Carthage of the bad new
bards, the advocateletkin has enough for the devil
himself. He damns and condemns with the sad
relish of the schoolmaster who .professes grief
before he thwacks you. Fortunately something
more than zeal is wanted. There is wanted
Knowledge—and Mr. Murdoch has not enough.
There is wanted Accuracy—and Mr. Murdoch has
not enough. There is wanted Taste—and Mr.
Murdoch has not enough. He is ill-informed, in-
accurate, and undisceming; though not to the
superlative degree. Did he know a little more, he
would have written differently; a little less, and
it would not be necessary to stress his blunders.
He is neither noxious nor unobnoxious.
* * * *
The multitude of vague premises, loose in-
ferences, irrelevant conclusions, in Mr. Murdoch’s
two single articles rolled into one, is a little
embarrassing. Perhaps it is better to begin at the
beginning:—
Is it true, as we are assured on all hands, that a new
note has been struck in Australian verse—a note of more
decisive power, more pungent sweetness, more con-
vincing truth, than any that Australia has hitherto
aohieved ; that at last the great dumb heart of our vast
and varied continent has, in Carlyle’s phrase, got itself
uttered ?
And Mr. Murdoch answers his own five-barrelled
question by “admitting without hesitation”
that a new group of writers has arisen, within the last
ten years, and presented us with a body of verse admir-
able in many ways, fresh, racy, vigorous, instinct with
the spirit of Australia. But when we are asked to go
further and accept these writers as poets in the full sense
of the term, then, indeed, some of us are inclined to
pause.
Then Mr. Murdoch mentions the names of this
“newgroup of writers,” to wit —Paterson, Lawson,
Dyson, Boako, Daley, Ogilvie, Quinn, Brady.
This is the place where I look round in a puzzled
■way and wonder wherever did Mr. Murdoch hear
or read those “ assurances on all hands ” ? I pay
attention to the local press ; but I have never seen
this general statement that “ the great heart of
Australia has been uttered,” etc. Personally I
don’t believe it has been uttered : I think the
most the new poets have done is to utter some out-
lying emotions. And personally, until Mr. Mur-
doch produces some evidence of his “assurances
on all hands,” I shall believe he dreamt them.
And surely, surely, Mr. Murdoch dreamt that
ho was ‘ ‘ asked to accept these writers as poets
in the full sense of the term.” Who asked him ?
where was he asked ? what is a poet “in the full
sense of the term ? ” The devil’s advocateletkin
does n’t say. I can only express the opinion that,
if his “ full sense of the term ” is anything like my
“ full sense of the term,” whoever ‘‘asked ” knew
nothing about the matter. Not one of the writers
named is a poet in my “ full sense of the term ”
a perfect poet; some of them are certainly poets
in the ordinary sense of the term, with more or
fewer reservations ; some of them are better classi-
fied as verse-writers in the ordinary sense of the
tenm and so classify themselves. Mr. Murdoch
is fighting men of straw. If he did n’t invent them,
wherever did he get them ?
* * * *
So far, the advocateletkin’s Knowledge and
Accuracy seem to have been at fault: he pro-
ceeds to exhibit bis lack of Taste.
Whether we accept them or not they are evidently pre-
pared to accept one another in a spirit of the deepest
veneration. Mr. Daley, for instance, has published his
opinion that Mr. Ogilvie’s is “ the most charming volume
of Australian verse that has yet appeared,” and straight-
way Mr. Ogilvie has set out, in verse, to return the com-
pliment :
“ And I would be content, content,
With such sweet scents and such gold gleams,
Could all my dole of days be spent
In Daley’s land of dreams.”
That is to say, Mr. Ogilvie would gladly spend the re-
mainder of his life, if circumstances permitted, in the
uninterrupted perusal of Mr. Daley’s volume of verses.
If, as some hold, the virtue of devils is in their
tails, here is indeed a wooden-tailed advocatelet-
kin ! It is unnecessary to point out to any imp
with a bone in his tail —and marrow in the bone —
that Ogilvie means, not what is stupidly attri-
buted to him, but precisely what he says—Daley’s
book visions a land of scented, golden dreams, and
he would be content to sacrifice the crude realities
of life if he could per-
chance dwell in that happy
dreamland. When, before
he is halfway down his
first column, a critic shows
such a fine, capacity for
misunderstanding his sub-
ject, what is there to be
hoped from him ?
And why should not
Ogilvie praise Daley, and
Daley Ogilvie, if both be
worthy of praise ? The
obvious person to praise
one poet is another poet,
who should naturally best
understand, be most in
tune with poetry. Tenny-
son spoke of Browning
as “the greatest-beamed poet in England,” and
wrote and told him so. Browning (in Mr. Mur-
doch’s phrase) “returned the compliment” by-
dedicating a volume of his poems “To Alfred
Tennyson, in poetry illustrious and consummate.”
The compliments of Ogilvie and Daley were, in
their minor way, as merited and sincere. If Mr.
Murdoch cannot appreciate the generosity of such
an interchange, others can. His bias has carried
him too far. If, indeed, he showed that either
Daley or Ogilvie is undeserving of the other’s
“compliment” he would make his point. At
present he has missed it—badly.
* * * *
The advocateletkin proceeds to heap error upon
error. He writes of
those among- ourselves who have loaded Mr. Ogilvie with
compliments such as were never accorded to Tennyson,
and saluted Mr. Eoderic Quinn with a rapture of admira-
tion which is usually reserved for Homer.
As to the first clause, Mr. Murdoch does not
quote these “compliments,” for he cannot. Ogilvie
may have been over-praised, but no one thought of
writing about him what Froude wrote of Tenny-
son—that he “ will stand far away by the side of
Shakespeare above all English poets ; ” or what
Poe wrote of Tennyson—“in perfect sincerity I
regard him as the noblest poet that ever lived.”
As to the second clause, I am not aware that there
is any special “ rapture of admiration which is
usually reserved for Homer,” and if there is
I am not aware why there should be. Poetry
did n’t end with Homer—or begin with him. If
Mr. Murdoch had defined a little more, and given
his proof instead of his dogma, the devil would
have been better justified of his advocateletkin.
* * * *
Mr. Murdoch proceeds to remark that
. . . the average English critic . . . may well feel some
bewilderment when he reads in a colonial paper that
“ Ogilvie is a poet of rare sweetness and charm,” or that
“ Daley’s music has the right magical quality.”
Why should he “feel bewilderment” in a matter
which he knows nothing about ? If I, knowing
nothing of Blank Dash, read in an English paper
that “Blank Dash is a poet of rare sweetness and
charm, ” I merely note the statement and reserve
judgment till I am better acquainted with Blank
Dash. “A poet of rare sweetness and charm”
does not reverse any established law of Nature.
He is not nine days in a week, or a joke in a
Scotchman’s head. I have met the phenomenon
before, and expect to meet it again. When Mr.
Murdoch asserts the English critic’s “ bewilder-
ment, ” I venture to think he libels the English
critic—and pass on to the next thumper—
That all the verse-writers whom I have named belong
to the same group —the same literary school —must be
evident to anyone who may have the time or the inclina-
tion to make even the most casual dip into their several
volumes. The difference—if there be any difference—is
no more than that between two bottles of the same
vintage.
Mr. Murdoch has named Paterson, Lawson,
Boake, Dyson, Daley, ? Ogilvie, Quinn, and Brady.
And he seriously asserts that Daley and Paterson
belong to the same group, that Ogilvie and Dyson
belong to the same literary school, that Quinn and
Brady have no more difference than that between
two bottles of the'same vintage! I can only
affirm that here is worse than want of knowledge;
here is Sheer Ignorance—and pass on.
♦ * * *
The advocateletkm’s next freak is to quote four
verses from Paterson, Dyson, Lawson, and Boake
—carefully choosing, in four volumes which mingle
good and bad, four of the worst and least poetical
verses —and argue that the metres are similar.
They are— et aprha ? Also, Spenser used the
Spenserian stanza; so did Byron; so did Keats;
so did Whyte-Melville. And the deduction?
There isn’t any—that will help Mr. Murdoch’s
complaint. Fancy complaining beoause Latin
poets write in hexameters, or Frenoh in alexan-
drines !
But Mr. Murdoch is not really in a cui-de-sao—
for this is the issue—
If there be anyone who still doubts the essential kin
ship of these poets, let him examine this stanza :
“ The pack-horse runs behind me, for he follows like a
dog—
When I go ride the boundary, I let the old horse jog.
It was somewhere in September, and the sun was going
down,
Two miles or more from water, and a hundred miles
from town ;
The drought came down on the field and flock, and
never a raindrop fell:
I reached the Realm of No-Return that meets the
March from Hell.”
Is there anything peculiar about this stanza—any break
in the continuity of the narrative, any jarring note to
interfere with the absolute unity of the style? Surely
not; and yet—you will scarcely believe it—the six lines
are taken from five different authors. Mr. Paterson is
responsible for the first and the fifth, Mr. Boake for the
second, Mr. Dyson for the third, Mr. Lawson for the
fourth, and Mr. Ogilvie for the sixth.
Prodigious ! With the discount that Mr. Mur-
doch’s Inaccuracy is in evidence, since he mis-
quotes Paterson, and converts Ogilvie’s “ March
of Hell” into “March from Hell”—making it
nonsense; that his want of Taste is in evidenpe,.
since the stanza in which he can see nothing
peculiar is obviously chopped and senseless ; and
that something else is in evidence—some hitherto
unnoted Murdochian quality which makes him
suppress the fact that, to make his point, he has
twice at least run two lines into one. Ogilvie’s
stanza, for example, reads—
Beyond where farthest drought-fires burn,
By hand of fate it once befell,
1 reached the realm of No-Return
That meets the March of Hell.
When Mr. Murdoch suggests that the melody and
style of this stanza are essentially kin or abso-
lutely uniform with those in Paterson’s “ Bush-
man’s Song
So it’s shift, boys, shift, for there isn’t the slightest doubt
We’ve got to make a shift to the stations further out
The pack-horse runs behind us, for he follows like a dog,
And we cross a lot of country at the old jig-jog
he merely convicts himself of having no Ear what-
ever—and none too much Conscience. Paterson,
Lawson, and Dyson, among others, do sometimes
use similar long-measure metres—chiefly in narra-
tive verses, and for the reason that long-measure
metres suit narrative verse ; but anyone who will
compare all the verses from which Mr. Murdoch’s
nnes are chosen;—carefully chosen by himself —will
be amazed that he should offer an opinion on any
poetic style whatever.
* * * *
But Mr. Murdoch not only offers his opinion;
he is proud of it. Of his mosaic verse he writes—
This method of criticism (copyright, by the way) is
peculiar, but not unenlightening. You could not play
such tricks with the genuine poets. Try to combine a
line of Tennyson with, lot us say, a line of Arnold, a line
oj B) owning, and a line of Swinburne, and the difference
in their respective manners becomes palpable at once.
Somebody should really take Mr. Murdoch by
his unpoetical ear and lead him to any Corpus
Eoetarum—where he will find that his “copy-
ni • ™ et ' lo d of criticism ” was hoary before the
Christian era. Why, all down the centuries
Poetasters have been making mosaics of Homer,
of Virgil, of half-a-dozen well-known poets. And
ahnost everybody has seen the cento “Wh'atis
Lite? —commencing
What strange infatuation rules mankind-Clwittertow.
What different spheres to human bliss assigned — Rogers.
and proceeding for fifty or sixty lines each
from a different poet—the common preference
for the pentameter arguing, according to Mr.
Murdoch, _ something unknown, but damnable
whatever it is. Really, really,, just here Mr.
Murdoch s want of Knowledge grows almost pain-
fully conspicuous. And when, proud of his
invention,” he_ proceeds to vent another
universal negative, it is hardly worth
while wasting ten minutes’ time to teach
him better. To make a clean job of the
advocateletkin, however 1
THE LAST KISS.
As a tired heavy honey-bee'
In this lone, open glade I He :
A little patience ere I die :
Forgive what seemed my sin in me.
The hopeless tangle of our age
May make one music as before . . ,
One last time, one more and no more,
Suck out my soul, thy heritage !
“I s there anything peculiar about these stanzas
—any break in the continuity of the narrative,
any jarring note to interfere with the absolute
umty of the style ? ” Much less than in Mr. Mur-
doch’s stanza; and yet—“you will scarcely
believe it ” —the eight lines are taken from four
different authors, the four with whom Mr. Mur-
doch declares■ you could not play such tricks.”
The first line in the first stanza is from Swinburne
(“At a Month’s End”); the second from M.
Arnold (“In Kensington Gardens”); the third
from Browning (“Waring”); the fourth from
Tennyson (“In Memoriam”), And “you will
scarcely believe ” that in the second stanza the
first line is from M. Arnold (“ Obermann ”); the
second from Tennyson (“ In Memoriam ”); the
third from Swinburne (“At a Month’s End”);
and the fourth from Browning (“In a Gondola”).
And the lines are not garbled, Mr. Murdoch.
To anyone with the least knowledge of litera-
ture, it must be plain that such patchwork is only
a matter of time and pains ; and there are at least
a dozen measures in which the chief English poets
can be used for it, besides the very easy blank
verse. It is borne in upon me just here that Mr.
Murdoch needs another diminutive; he is nothing
more than a devil’s advocateletkinling, after all.
* * * *
Mr. Murdoch—speaking still of all the writers
he named—suggests that they imitate Kipling. If
he had said that some of them have been in-
fluenced by Kipling, and one or two have imi-
tated Kipling, he would be correct. But Boake
knew nothing of Kipling; Daley (in his pub-
lished verses) is untouched by him; Quinn shows
no trace of him. As to copying Kipling’s metre,
the charge is foolish. There is doubtfully an original
metre in all Kipling’s work. If Mr. Murdoch
will take the trouble to look at any book of Eng-
lish rhythms, he will find lines with seven and
eight accents, of the kind he cavils at, as far back
as Robert of Gloucester, even as far back as
Caedmon. The 16th century was flooded with
such lines ; and if Mr. Murdoch wants to know,
not the source, but the greatest fountain of them,
he can open Chapman’s “ Iliad.”
* * * * . ■
Mr. Murdoch goes on to misquote Daley, and
suggest that he imitates Tennyson (if anybody has
written ‘‘ In Memoriam ’’metre without that charge
being brought by some sciolist, one would like his
address), but there must be an end to all things,
even to this criticism of the two-and-a-quarter-
oolumn Argus critic. One example of Mr. Mur-
doch's method is, however, too astonishing to
omit. He carefully selects passages of four
lines each from George Meredith, Erancis Thomp-
son, and others, compares them with carefully ill-
seleoted passages from Paterson and Lawson—two of
the crudest bards in the batch —and invites readers
to grieve over “ the immensity of the difference.”
Suppose I picked choice lines from Quinn or
Ogilvie, and compared them with lines from
Meredith’s poetry like
The friable and the grumous, dizzard* both,
or from Francis Thompson’s poetry, like his idea of
Autumn’s influence on the moon—
Thy mists enclip
Her steel-clad circuit illumlnous,
Until it crust
Rubiginous
With the glorious gules of a growing rust
what would the advocateletkinling say ?
I haven’t the least idea, and can’t stop to
guess ; for I want at least thirty-five more diminu-
tives, and have only four or five languages to pick
them from. A complete mincing of Mr. Mur-
doch’s means, methods, and motives is plainly out
of the question; and I already feel, with Mr.
Spoopendyke, as if I only wanted two cog-wheels
and a pound of cold meat to be a sausage-machine.
I give the devil’s advocateletkinlingetc. up.

Wanted—a Simile.
Under the Gum-Tree on July 15 will appear a
short article on The Simile. Readers are invited
to send specimen similes, which may be either
original or borrowed. In the latter case an exact
reference to the source of quotation is desired.
Two prizes of-10s. 6d. each are offered—one for
the most poetical, and one for the most curious and
piquant simile.
It may be unnecessary to explain that the simile
is a comparison in language, and according to the
grammars is usually known by the signs “ as ” or
“like” or “ than.” Thus the lover’s “eyes like
violets drenched with dew,” and the American’s
“horse slower than the wrath of God,” are similes
which would fall each in its class in the classes
sought for. v
Specimen similes should reach The Bookfellow
by Bth July, 1899.

SURPRISING CURES AFTER YEARS

W. H. Malyon, Esq., Man. Chemist, Ballarat.
Dear Sir, —For years past (about ten), I have been
troubled with “ Acne ” in its worst form, and have sought
advice from the best Australian and London doctors, with
only fair results. A Victorian friend of mine, some four
or five weeks ago, sent me a tin of your “ Ligmolliene,”
and speaking very highly of its wonderful curative powers.
I naturally took same “ Cum Gvano Sails,’’ and was in-
clined not to use it ; eventually I tried your ointment
with truly marvellous results, and am now entirely cured ;
and think people who suffer from skin diseases are greatly
indebted to you for your wonderful remedy. I shall
advise all my friends with skin troubles to use same.
Wishing “ Ligomolliene ” all the success it richly deserves,
Yours faithfully, GEORGE J. O REGAN,
WHAT THE DOCTORS SAY
Doveton-street, Ballarat,
My dear Mr. Malyon,— August 21st, 1898.
With great pleasure I now sit down to record progress
with regard to my old enemy, “ Eczema Capitis,” from
which I suffered, notwithstanding constant treatment for
some years under the prescription of Professor M'Call
Anderson and other eminent dermatologists, with only
partial and temporary relief. When I met you I com-
menced somewhat sceptically your ointment Ligmolliene,
and after about two months’ treatment I may honestly say
my enemy is defeated, and I am perfectly well. I will only
add that since I commenced the treatment of myself I have
prescribed it to others, and am still doing so with brilliant
results. Please accept my hearty thanks, and remain yours
sincerely, THOS. LE GAY HOLTHOUSE, M.R.C.S., L.

HARE SHOULD BE EXERCISED in the SELECTION
V AND USE OF A FOOD FOR INFANTS ; this is a
matter of common experience, but the “why and wherefore,”
are subjects of knowledge to the few only. In spite of the
general recognition of the immense importance of this
matter, it is one upon which a wide-spread and lamentable
ignorance prevails. There is, it is true, a growing feeling
with mothers that
FARINACEOUS FOODS
ARE BAD FOR INFANTS,

dearly bought experience, which is paid by the lives of
thousands of little ones.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Silverton, which so hummed in the N.S.
Wales silver-boomtime, has had the bailiff in,
with the result that its safe (said safe has long been
used only for the storage of atmosphere), and the
council-table, and the mayoral-chair, and the
other chairs, and past-panjandrums’ portraits on
the walls, and a few other things, have gone to the
highest bidders. There is still a part of a council
left, though no rate has been struck for a couple
of years. In view of a possible meeting to “con-
sider the situation ” within a year or two—you
musn’t bustle Silverton now—the local paper sug-
gests an addition to the convening notice : “ City
fathers must bring their own gin-cases.” But
there are so few people in dead-and-gone Silverton
now that they can hardly find a quorum, even if
every sober Chow is made an alderman.
Why I Go to Church.
I’ve a wife, who dares confess
She attends to show her dress;
I’ve a son, who plainly shows
’Tis because I go he goes ;
But I’m puzzled to declare
Why the devil I am there !
Partly, I suppose, for pleasure ;
Sit and take my neighbors’ measure ;
Study faces, heads, deportments,
Sterling blended Scotch assortments !
Mark the parson’s misquotations,
Or the singers’ aberrations ;
Make the service of the Sunday
Spice for satire on the Monday.
Hear the grand old Bible read
( That's the leaven in the bread !),
Songs of Oriental night,
Tales of grand barbaric fight—
Till the warning organ hums,
And the drowsy sermon comes ;
Then I watch upon the pane
Flies crawl up, and down again,
Climbing up—and—climbing —down. . •
But my wife’s face wears a frown,
And my own is like a sheep,
So I know I’ve been asleep.
Secondly, because I know
Chapel is a business show ;
Stamps you as a man of weight
If you’re trusted with the plate.
’Tis the place of Brotherhood ;
I and Smith, who sells me wood,
Under one high holy roof
Worship both the great god Oof.
Thirdly (note parsonic heading),
’Tis the manner I was bred in.
As a knickerbocker mute,
Always had a Sunday suit;
Always marched in public view
To a solemn family pew ;
Always proved a hungry sinner
At the savory Sabbath dinner,
Where my dear old dad, who’s dead,
Longer grace than usual said—
Customs I am loth to break
For his anxious spirit’s sake.
Makes me shave when I am lazy,
Rests me if my brain is hazy,
Gets me up on mornings fine,
Anyway, in time to dine ;
Gives me paragraphs surprising,
Swells the local advertising ;
Makes me swear, or makes me smile,
Helps my journalistic style ;
Makes me nod, or makes me wink,
Anything but makes me think ;
Plenty reason, if you search,
Why a man should go to church !
PAGAN.
The Torture of Success.
The worlds have fought and fallen one by one ;
The tattered flags are draggled in the dust;
The tumult that the triumph roused is done ;
The swords grow red with rust.
Day follows day; the victor broods and stares
Into the space that makes his prison walls ;
The wished-for taunt no passing planet dares,
No cheering challenge falls.
Self-sentenced for a life to fret and mope,
He writhes despairing ’neath the tedium’s strain,
The while his slave, thrilled with a mighty hope,
Sings as he tugs his chain.
M‘G.
Sea-Grief.
Along the serried coast the South-wind raves,
Grey birds scream landward through the distance
hoar,
And, swinging from the dim confounded shore,
The everlasting boom of broken waves
Like muffled thunder rolls about the graves
Of all the wonder-lands and lives of yore,
Whose bones asunder bleach for evermore
In sobbing chasms and under choking caves.
O breaking heart—whose only rest is rage,
White tossing arms, and lips that kiss and part
In lonely dreams of Love’s wild liberty—
Not the mean earth thy suffering can assuage,
Nor highest heaven fulfil that hungry heart,
O fair, full-bosomed, passionate, weeping Sea !

The Legend.
IT was in the summer of 1778, Wash-
ington, with his army ever active,
determined to oppose the British
general, Sir Henry Clinton, who, having
evacuated Philadelphia, was retreating
through New Jersey on New York. The
forces met on 28th June at Monmouth.
La Payette conducted the attack. The
heat was so intense that some refused to
fight, and many fell dead from exposure
to the sun’s rays. Both sides fought
desperately. As the day waned, and the
flagging spirits of La Fayette’s soldiers
were at a low ebb, a strange sight aroused
them. Marching with drum and fife
was an old man, Jeremiah Wynton, and
his son, and grandson. The old father,
with silvery flowing locks, sturdily strode
through the field. The son with ban-
daged head fifing lustily, the youth,
catching the spirit of his grandsire, rolled
out with him the soul-inspiring rattle of
the drum. Father, son, and grandson
had accompanied the troops as volunteers,
and were ever in the forefront of the
fight. The fierce light of battle was in
their eyes, they knew no fear, and many
a wild cheer arose, as on that fateful
day Yankee Doodle was heard as never
was heard before or since.

“SECRETS OF THE BALLROOM.”
WANTON WOMEN RENOUNCED.
MELBOURNE, Sunday,—The Rev. George
Gladstone, incumbent ot Holy Trinity Church,
Nathalia, preached to-night on “Secreta of the
Ballroom,” taking for his text, "They have be-
gun to wax wanton.” The church was crowded,
and the rev. gentleman's remarks werb received
with frequent expressions of dissent, and also
with laUghter J'e had noticed, he said, the most
wanton women in Nathalia were church-
goers, but they did not attend his church, hav-
ing been driven out. The ballroom was a char-
nel house, where those who attended brushed
shoulders with wantons and harlots. A wanton,
he said, was a married woman who had one hus-
band, and wanted two or three more. Tho
women of Goulburn Valley were cursed with tho
spirit Of wantonness, and next time they saw
in the local press the names of married women
attending these white corrobaries they would
know them as wantons —as women who had one
husband a piece, but who wished tor more.

SATURDAY, JUNE 10, 1899.
The Broader View.
“ State finance has been made the basis of this in-
quiry ; but it is only a narrow view of Federation.
THERE IS THE BROADER VIEW-THE WELFARE OF
THE PEOPLE. The removal of all customs duties on in-
terprovincial trade, the enlargement of markets, even
here in New South Wales, from 1,300,000 to 3,000,000 or
4,000,000 of consumers, means an amount of internal de-
velopment we can hardly foresee. It is idle to fear, as
Mr. Heydon appears to do, that we of New South Wales
shall be the helpless prey of the colonies by which on
three sides we are surrounded. On the contrary, it will
in time throw a great manufacturing industry into this
colony. Newcastle will develope into a second Middles-
brough, and the Illawarra into a second Lanark, and we
shall be able to hold our own quite as successfully as we
do now. There are many other changes which Federa-
tion will develope. The hangers-on to Ministries, those
whose business it is to prey upon the provincial revenues,
will find their occupation far less remunerative when
government is established on a wider and more national
basis. We believe, too, that the “Protectionist” in the
southern colonies will in time become less and less a
“Protectionist,” as the area of internal competition
widens, and prices find an Australian level.”— From
Federal Finance (page 21), a series of articles by It. L.
Nas i\, financial editor of Sydney Telegraph, which were
published by that paper in its own columns before it dis-
covered that the Federal capital was not to be at Sydney,
and consequently that it would have to spend £5OOO a year
in getting the Commonwealth Parliamentary reports tele-
graphed to its office.
* * * •
The above quotation is cordially recom-
mended by The Bulletin to the considera-
tion of all Australians. It represents the
“ Broader View ” of the great Federal ques-
tion. Also it was published by the very
paper which now leads the Little Cornstalk
party, and lies with an incredible horse-
power of lying against the movement which
will make Australia rich and great and
united —and will incidentally cost the Sydney
D.T. £5OOO a year. In all ages there have
been people who would sell a whole nation
to the worst fate that could befall it for
much less than £5OOO a year, so its attitude
in this matter isn’t remarkable. The quota-
tion at the head of this article is thrown in
mainly as a text. There are two aspects in
which the Federal question can be con-
sidered. One is the hard business view
—the one which gropes in the 'mud for
a lost halfpenny, and is ready to sacri-
fice all the chances of building up a nation
for fear that some neighbour has got ahead
of us, or we have -failed to get ahead
of some neighbour, by a copper per annum or
a threepenny-bit per century. It has been
talked of till all New South Wales is half
blind and wholly dazed through looking on
the dusty floor of Time for the accursed
halfpenny that isn’t there—the imaginary
public “ brown ” which blocks the way to
union. The other is the broad national
view—the one which recognises that the
world isn’t all dusty floor, or all dropped
halfpenny, and that there is a sky above as
well as a mud-hole below. And it is worth
while considering that there is such a view.
* * * *
Australia has little history as yet, and it
has hardly any national heroes, except sundry
prize-fighters and cricketers. It has not much
past, and in its present disjointed state, no
future. The largest population which any one
of its miserably barren provinces can ever
support, so far as any one is able to judge, will
never make the biggest of the six separate
Australias strong enough to defend itself
against outside aggression. The best pros-
pect for the best of them in its disjointed
state is to be an overgrown infant, hanging
on to the apron-tail of Britain—a dependeir,
subject affair, never growing to real man-
hood. It is just possible that a great number
of Australians don’t care whether their
country every grows to manhood or not, and
are quite satisfied to be dependent upon
Britain indefinitely. But even then the
British empire isn’t immortal any more than
any other empire. It is a thing of yesterday
—a stupendous mushroom which grew and
bloated in a couple of centuries, and it is
composed of such a multitude of incongruous
elements (about five-sixths assorted nigger
and one-sixth white), that it is even less
likely to last than most empires. When its
great day of trouble comes, as it comes
to every empire soon or late, Australia
has these contingencies to face : It can (if it
is a united community with a defence system
which will make the best of its scanty popu-
lation, and with all its resources under one
head, instead of being torn asunder by the
conflicting counsels of six Governments and
six commanders) lend what aid it can to save
the British state. Or it can let the British
state slide and do something to save itself.
Or it can let itself slide also, being incapable
through its frantic disunion of making a
serious effort in its own defence, and become
subject to the first master that comes its way.
* * * *
The face of the world has changed mightily
even in the last half-dozen years. The
desire for conquest is as furious as ever, but
there is very little left now to conquer. This
is no longer the day of small states. There
is no state in the world now with a popula-
tion even twice as large as Australia’s which
maintains an absolutely independent exis-
tence. They all exist more or less
under the shadow and protection of
some big neighbour, and by some big neigh-
bour’s kind permission. No place can
reckon now on remaining safe and indepen-
dent simply because it is overlooked in the
scramble ; the scramble has become so fierce
that the great nations overlook no place,
however humble. And in this hungry,
savage, brutal world—this slaughter-house
where there is no right but the right of the
strongest—Australia has to reckon' up its
chances. Which are these : It has an im-
mense country to defend, and by reason of
its droughts and deserts it is never likely to
have more than a scanty population to de-
fend it with. It has to defend all of it ; for
a foreign Power to make a permanent lodg-
ment on even a remote part of Australia
would be the beginning of the end of its
independence. It has six burlesque armies ;
six commanders ; no central authority ; no
national military force ; no one military
head ; no plan for the defence of the country
in general ; no uniformity of weapons ; no
uniform railway gauge to permit of the
rapid movement of troops ; no arsenal ;
no arms and ammunition factories large
enough to be of the slightest service. Its
sole dependence is on its aged parent 16,000
miles away, and that parent has shouldered
the White Man’s Burden on so stupendous a
scale that she has several hundred other
dependencies to protect in time of trouble.
Also, her empire is a sudden affair, which
has bloated itself to incredible dimensions
almost in a day—a stupendous burden of
undigested niggerdom which may dissolve
away as suddenly as it rose. And, in any
case, Australia can’t always be a dependent
infant crying to its aged parent for assist-
ance. Some day or other it must be a man,
and shoulder its own burden.
* * * *
The anti-Federalists of Australia (mostly
located in New South Wales) are, in the
main, old men who have no future of their
own, and who don’t see why anyone else
should want one. George Bibbs will pro-
bably be dead, and the two Heydon, s dust,
and the other old, long, sal prophets of evil
only bones, before the time comes when Aus-
tralia will have to be united or perish. They
don’t expect to see the new all-Australian race
grow up—so it matters nothing to them if
it never grows up. It will probably take
100 or 200 years of union to obliterate the
sordid little interprovincial animosities which
the old Dibbs and Heydon and Want faction
has sown, and a real Australian people
out of the fragmentary provinces to which
that faction preaches the doctrine of hatred
and backbiting, and mean slander, and de_
grading suspicion. Therefore, there is
abundant reason for beginning the work
now. there isn’t even time to wait til]
Dibbs and Want and Heydon are dead—
unless there is some guarantee that they are
going to die promptly. The destiny of tine
world doesn t lie with its old men, and the
valuable doctrine of disrespect to the aged
isn t so well understood as it ought to be.
Lhe theory of .the old Jeremiahs is that the
disunion which was good enough for them
should be good enough for others, and that
the petty hatreds which were good enough
for them should not be despised by their de-
scendants. They date back to a time when
Sydney and its surroundings were practically
all Australia, and because they were born
then they reckon that that little period was
all history, and that Sydney and its sur-
roundings should be all Australia for ever.
And they want their descendants, who know
nothing of the squalid epoch which was good
enough for these people to be born in, to sulk
apart, and refuse to recognise any state of
things except the one which prevailed when
Dibbs and Want were young. And to their
old eyes the halfpenny which may possibly be
lost by union now is of more account than
the dire necessity of making Australia a solid
nation which can hold its own when the time
comes that it must hold its own, or go
under. For the halfpenny is in their time,
and the immeasurable possibilities of the
future are in somebody else’s time. .Which
makes all the difference.
* * * *
Let Australia look all over the world and
consider which among the great earth-
hungry States it would like to have for a
master. Then let it consider the fact that
every country has sooner or later to defend
itself as best it can, or else accept a foreign
master. It is nothing to do with the future
that Dibbs and Want and other ancients
date back to the time when old Syd-
ney saw itself overshadowed almost in
a night by the gold - boom growth of
Melbourne, and that they thereupon ac-
quired a mean, grudging, slow-burning
hatred for their upstart neighbour, and would
let their country slide to any kind of per-
dition rather than recognise a Victorian as a
brother. Their old, petty, squalid grievance
isn’t a line of defence which would keep out
even the weakest enemy. And it is the only
defence they have to offer. New South
Wales has tried them as rulers, and found
them hopelessly incapable. It has asked
them for a better plan of union than the one
they denounce, and found that they have no
plan at all. It has seen the ill-omened
cocked-hat of Dibbs and the blazing mous-
tache of Neild flaring in the front of a
ragged battalion of goose-step warriors, and
it has reluctantly to admit that they are not
defences to be regarded seriously. Austra-
lia has to consider its future, if it is ever to
have a future worth possessing. It can’t
always rely on far-off Britain for its sole de-
fence. It can’t always have its highest
national ideal in the bruiser, or the fast
sculler, or the beetle-browed footballer, or
the man who hits a ball with a bat and makes
it go a long way. It can’t stop for ever
to consider the fact that the personal
and parochial vanity of Dibbs and
Want was grievously .injured some 40
years ago, and they have never felt right
since. The world is in a great hurry ; it has
a long way to go, and it can’t stop even for
the injury done to Dibbs’s parochial dignity
40 years ago.
* * * *
Fortunately there are Australians who love
their country well enough to have a thought
for its welfare 100 or even 1000 years hence,
and who are not wholly wrapped up in the
soulless, tired philosophy that things will last
their time, and nobody else’s time matters
much. They form one of the two classes of
patriots ; the members of the other class
love their country while they are alive, and
reckon that its history ends with their lives,
and that it is necessary to provide for its
welfare and good government as long as they
live, and that any scheme for its future im-
provement is good if its best advantages are
likely to be reaped in their time. This is
the crowd whose whole idea of Federation is
wrapped up in the fact that it may cost a
little extra in the next few years before the
machine of the new Government gets into
proper working order. They expect to be
here during the next few years, so these few
years are important. The thousand years
after that when they are not here are ot.no
account.
into all the other provinces free of duty, whil
the sugar from the Colonial Sugar Refining
Co.’s nigger-worked Fijian plantations will pay
whatever duty the Commonwealth levies on
outside sugar. Which will be bad —very bad
—for the MaoLaurin and Knox Sugar Co.
But Knox says :
The allusion to our Fiji business is ridiculous ; almost
the whole of the sugar made .there goes to Maoriland,
and no one has ever dreamed of that colony being in-
cluded in an Australian confederation, nor have we
thought it possible that, sugar produced there should come
to Australia when federated, seeing that Queens-
land and New South Wales already make more than is
needed to supply this contiment and Tasmania.
Let’s see ! At the date of Coghran’s latest
issue of the “Seven Colonies” £211,000 worth
of Fijian sugar w ent to Maoriland and .£257,000
worth to Australia. No recent returns covering
all Australasia are to hand, but in N.S. W., at
all events, the Fijian sugar trade is a fast
grow'ing one. In 1896, N.S.W. imported .£lO
worth of sugar direct from Fiji (where the
Knox-MacLaurin co.’s nigger-worked planta-
tions and mills are), and £2 worth via Maori-
land. In 1897 it imported £9084 worth direct
and £1065 worth via Maoriland. In 1898 it im-
ported £19,561 worth direct and £3500 worth via
Maoriland. And in Victoria, Tasmania, and
S.A. (which are not sugar-growing provinces
like N.S. W.) the trade is presumably expand-
ing also, though it can’t be expanding with the
tremendous velocity of the N.S.W. trade. And
it is growing at the above rate despite the great
increase in Queensland’s sugar production. And
Knox admits that he expects to lose all this
o rowing trade under Federation. While Aus-
tralia remains disunited, even if Queensland
produces enough sugar to supply all Aus-
tralia twice over, the Knox company’s
Fijian sugar has access to the markets of the
other provinces on the same terms as the
Queensland article. It may cost a fraction
more in freight from Fiji to Melbourne than
from Bundaberg to Melbourne, but the cheaper
labor of Fiji should still enable the syndicate’s
island sugar to hold its own against that of the
Queensland farmer. In fact, it is holding its
own, and more. If Fiji, Queensland, and
N.S.W. among them produce more surplus
sugar than the rest of Australasia can absorb—
w'ell, under the present disunion conditions the
cheapest nigger will get the trade. But with a
united Australia the cheapest nigger—-the
Colonial Sugar Co.’s Fijian nigger—will almost
assuredly be barred out. And, by manager
Knox’s own acknowledgment, he expects to be
barred out. And MaoLaurin, Knox, and
other Sugar Co. potentates are doing their best
to maintain the present profitable state of dis-
union and to prevent that Federation which
will bar out the Fiji cheap nigger product, and,
according to Knox, 538 out of 550 shareholders
are doing likewise And they all say it is utterly
ridiculous to even dream that they can have
any sordid interest in the matter.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Knox and Sugar.
Colonial Sugar Refining Co. Knox writes to
the Sydney Telegraph (June 1) to point out
that it is only by coincidence that he and
Kater and MacLaurin (all largely interested
in the Colonial Sugar Refining Co.) are against
Federation. In another letter (June 3) he savs
that out of 550 shareholders he doesn’t know of
12 who support the Federation Bill, but he adds
“this feeling has nothing to do with their interest
in the co.” In fact, they all reluctantly admit
that they are actuated by a spirit of pure
patriotism. So long as disunion lasts, it is
true, N.S.W., Victoria, S.A., and Tasmania
charge the same duty on the sugar made at the
State-aided Central Mills of Queensland and
that which comes from the Colonial Sugar Co.’s
cheap-nigger-worked mills and plantations in
Fiji. And when Federation arrives, with
Queensland inside the Commonwealth and Fiji
outside it, the sugar made at the Queensland
co-operative mills—which don’t belong to any

That lights up young eyes with the pride of the
Name ;
There’s signal and token, there’s welcome bespoken,
There’s a Star at whose shining the Darkness

There’s barriers broken, there’s sleepers have

She comes, a fair Nation ! Australia, hail!
The Bush-winds breathe Freedom above and

From feud and mean quarrel she brings us release;
With blessing and healing she’s girt her and bound
her—
Cinctured with Harmony ; sandalled with Peace.
And yet they could slander her ! yet they could

Before that calm beauty could tremble and quail!
Ah, heed not, delay not! draw nearer, draw nearer,
Our Lady of Promise ! Australia, hail!
Long have we cried for thee, long sought and

Bowed with a burden of jealous regret;
Let not our children be alien and rent as we,
Knowing our folly—and hugging it yet;
Break the traditions that chain and enslave us,
Shame into silence self-seekers who rail,
Make us more worthy the boon that Fate gave us,
From ourselves save us ! Australia, hail !
Give us a scutcheon as wide as our Continent!
Give us a Flag that will shelter us all,
Fold us and shroud us, if ever on blood-besprent
Battle-field fighting, we falter and fall.
For ill communion, give brotherly Union ;
For catchwords, a Watchword; for. marsh-fires, a
Grail; -
Whatever is to be, let us front Destiny
Shoulder to shoulder ! Australia, hail !
There’s thrills and there’s tremors that set tfle
blood tingling,
There’s lighting of beacons through all the broad
East;
There’s scent of blown orchids with wattle-bloom
mingling—
Strew fern for her pathway ! pour wine for her

For she’s coming—and singing ! you hear her !

the capital of New Zealand. Influence and chicanery
removed it to Wellington. . . . Where is Auckland now ?
And this is the moan of “Gerald Camp-
bell ” in the same wilderness of unreliable
ink :
“The following few lines from the article in the
‘Encyclopaedia Britannica,’dealing with the government
of the Argentine Republic, may not be amiss at the
present time. The words are . , ,
“The city of Buenos Ayres, besides being the seat of
the "-overnmerit of the province (Buenos Ayres) is also the
tne national government (it isn’t Buenos Ayres
but La Plata which is the seat of the State Government
now, but G. Campbell probably didn't know), HAVING
BEEN SO DECLARED BY THE CONSTITCTION UNTIL
SUCH ’ITME AS A SUITABLE SITE FOR A NEW
CAPITAL FOR THE REPUBLIC MAY BE DETER-
MINED ON BY THE LEGISLATURE ! ” . .
“ Buenos Ayres rejoined the Argentine Republic in
1860. NEARLY 40 YEARS have, therefore, now passed
away since the capital was ‘ temporarily ’ placed in
Buenos Ayres, and still the capital remains there, and
will, no doubt, continue in that pleasant city till the end
of time.”
So the situation may be summed up as follows :
(1) The Maoriland capital was removed from Auckland.
That proves Federation to be utterly bad.
(2) The Argentine capital was not removed from Buenos
Ayres. That proves Federation to be simply awful.
(3) Auckland, not being the capital of Maoriland, has
grown to be far the biggest city in the province. That
proves that Sydney will be wrecked through not having
the capital.
(4) Buenos Ayres, being the capital of Argentina, is
also the biggest city of its country. That proves the
same thing as the other thing proves.
(5) The fact that the Maoriland Parliament did remove
from Auckland shows clearly that the Australian Com-
monwealth Parliament won’t remove from Melbourne.
(6) The fact that the Argentine Congress did not re-
move from Buenos Ayres shows exactly the same thing.
(7) The fact that the Maoriland Parliament was moved
emonstrated clearly that “ influence and chicanery”
ere at work. And the ariti-Federalists allege that
owing to influence and ohicanery the Australian Parlia-
ment won’t move from Melbourne. Whether you move
a Parliament, or whether you don’t move it, doesn’t
matter. It is a dear case of chicanery either way.
(8) The fact that the Maoriland Parliament was moved
from its temporary home in Auckland shows clearly that
when a Parliament takes up its temporary residence any-
where (as the Federal Parliament will do in Melbourne) it
never shifts.
(9) The fact that the Argentine Constitution fixed the
capital at Buenos Ayres (only with the reservation that
Congress could move if it felt so inclined) and that the
capital is there, shows clearly that when the Australian
Constitution fixed the capital in N.S.W. the capital won’t
be there.
For the logic of anti-Federalism is like unto
nothing else on the face of this earth, and,
according to the reasoning of the Telegraph,
if one tiling is green and another thing is white
they both prove equally well that the third
thing is black and will always remain so.
Wherefore The Bulletin now goes out in
disgust to kick Geo. Pile’s dog in the hope of
bringing that ignorant and absurd beast to a
better frame of mind.

The “ Telegraph ” Bids the N.S.W. Coal-
Miner to Vote for the Bill.
It is so rarely that Sydney Telegraph (which
stands to lose .£SOOO a-year if the present Fede-
ration goes through) says something about the
Bill that is quite true that the following is
worth quoting :
The 103rd section of the Bill undoubtedly confers
power upon the local Parliament to foster the coal-indus-
try of South Gippsland by means of Exceptional Railway
Rates, -"and this assuredly would not be interfered with by
any action of the Inter-State Commission. The miner’s
must gain as consumers under this Bill. There is no
Restriction upon these Bounties, either from the States
or the Commonwealth.— Sydney Telegraph, Ist June.
This is absolutely true, so far as it goes —barring
the fact that the muddled paper can’t even
quote the right section, which, in the amended
Bill now before the country, is No. 104. The
rest of the story is that the same clause allows
N.S.W. Parliament to foster the coal-industry
of Newcastle and other places by exceptional
railway rates —in fact, it allows every State to
foster every one of its industries by exceptional
railway rates as much as it pleases, at its own
expense. Victoria can carry its own coal at £d.
per 100 tons for 100 miles if it likes—at its own
loss; also, N.S.W. can carry its own coal at
nothing per ton if it likes—also at its own loss.
But—and this is where the mean prevari-
cation of the Telegraph suppresses the
most important half of the story—if Vic-
toria, or any other province, carries its own
coal, on its own railways, at its own loss,
for a ridiculously low rate IT MUST CARRY
THE COAL OF THE OTHER PROVINCES
AT THE SAME RATE. Victoria cannot sub-
sidise its own coal without subsidising N.S.W.’s
coal also. And N.S.W., being the only pro-
vince which has any surplus coal to export, is
the only one which profits by this deal. If
Victoria cuts down its own coal-rates to half-a-
farthing per mile, it must carry the imported
N.S.W. coal at the same figure, and subsidise
N.S.W. as well as itself. If N.S.W. cuts
down its own coal-rates to a tenth of a farthing
per mile it doesn’t thereby subsidise Victorian
coal as well as its own, for Victoria has no
surplus coal to export to N.S.W. As for the
rest, the Telegraph says that “the miners
must gain as consumers under this Bill ”
which is absolute solid fact, and a good reason
why every miner should vote for it. Elsewhere
the paper contradicts itself stupidly and hor-
ribly by saying that the miner won’t gain, but
will lose 225. 6d. per annum—but, then, that
isn’t true.

The Awful Canadian Constitution.
The admiration of the Sydney provincial
shriekers for the Canadian Federal Constitu-
tion (they cordially recommend the same as a
pattern to Australia, and implore all Austra-
lians to reject the present offer and wait till
they can get a really beautiful and blessed
constitoosh’n like the Canadian article) is a
curious affair. In Canada nobody has a vote
for the House of Commons unless he has some
property or a certain income—except in the
empty N.W. Territory, where there is one-
man-one-vote. Nobody at all has a vote for
the Senate. The latter body is composed of
life nominees, who must be men of property.
It can’t be dissolved if it defies the popular
will. It can’t be swamped ; the number of
senators is fixed by the Constitution, so if the
Senate defies the popular will—well, it just
goes on defying till the members die. There is
no cure for deadlocks —none whatever. The
Senate has full power to reject Money Bills,
and all other Bills, and there is no remedy but
revolution. And this absolutely irresponsible
and unshiftable House of Nominees is paid for
obstructing. It isn’t built on a population
basis, though the G. Pile’s Dog crowd always
asserts that it is : Prince Edwar d Island has one
senator for every 27,000 people; Ontario, one
for 88,000 ; Nova Scotia, one for 45,000 ; New
Brunswick, one for 32,000; British Columbia, one
for 33,000 and so on. There are seven provin-
cial Cabinets and Governors, and a Governor-
General with a Dominion Cabinet of fourteen
paid Ministers. And the old Tories of the
Cornstalk anti-Federal party, who profess to
object to our own Commonwealth idea as not
sufficiently Democratic, hold up this abortion —
this Senate of immovable life nominees, all men
of property, with an absolute veto, and with-
out even the questionable virtue of represent-
ing the provinces on a population basis, and
bolstered up by a Constitution which contains
no provision for amendment whatever—as the
model which Australia should follow ! Yet
considering the material of which the Geo.
Pile’s Dog crowd is constructed, the situation
doesn’t look so very unnatural. The gall of the
ancient snags who recommend the Canadian
horror as democratic, and complain that the
proposed Australian Senate, elected by One-
man-one-vote, dissolvable, and liable to be
suppressed at any time by the Lower House at
a joint sitting, is undemocratic, might surprise
a stranger, but the people of N.S. W. have got
used to a lot of things of late.

The Labor-party’s Own Constitution.
A conference of delegates from the unions of
N.S.W., Vic., Queensland and S.A. has just
been framing a Constitution for a federation of
Australian labor. And without looking just
now into the excellent project itself, note a
thing or two incidentally : (1) Each province
was equally represented. South Australia had
just as many delegates as N.S.W. (2) The
supreme power, so far as it is delegated, is
conferred on a Federal Council, whicli “ shall
be constituted of delegates elected by and from
the provincial councils ” (observe, not by the
members, and not even by the unions), “ as
follows: 500 to 2000 members, 2 delegai es; 2001
to6ooo,3delegates; over6ooo,4delegates. Four
to be the maximum number of delegates from
any provincial Council” —and until otherwise
provided for there is to be one provincial Coun-
cil for each province. So Tas., S.A., and
W.A., with (say) each 1500 affiliated members,
would have six members in the Federal Parlia-
ment of Labor; and N.S.W:, with (say)
25,000 members, would have four ! And
the Labor-party howls for representation ac-
cording to population as the only democratic
idea for a Federal Council. (3) “The powers
provided in these rules shall be exercised only
upon a two-thirds majority division of the
Federal Council.” And The Bulletin has an
idea that two-thirds is even greater than three-
fifths, which was the fraction that lately drove
some good Labor men to frenzy. The moral of
it all is the old one that it is a lot easier to
chuck stones at a proposed Federal Con-
stitution because it isn’t democratic enough
than to fix up a more democratic Federal
Constitution yourself. It wouldn’t have
been a bad idea to have had an interprovincial
conference representing the unions for the pur-
pose of suggesting a draft constitution for Aus-
tralia ; but even without that conference vve
can get a pretty good idea from this other draft
constitution which has been found necessary.
For look at it; is there anything in the whole
Commonwealth Bill to equal this scheme for
giving 500 unionists two delegates and 10,000
other unionists only four in a governing body
(elected by another governing body) wherein a
two-third majority is necessary ?

Dr. MacLaurin’s Infant.
“ T. Bolin,” in the S. M. Herald, works out
Dr. MacLaurin’s 225. 6d. logic to its legitimate
conclusion :
By figures—which notoriously cannot lie—he has
proved to us conclusively that every man, woman, and
child in the community will have to pay, under Federa-
tion, extra customs taxation of more than £1 per annum;
and this to a man with a wife and four children means £6
per annum as the price of Federation. The method is ex-
tremely simple ;so many people in the province—so much
customs—divide one by the other, and the thing is done ;
you have conclusive proof that every man with a family
of four children will pay £6 more per annum than he
does at present to the revenue. But this method should
not be confined to Federal calculations only.
In the year ended June 30, 1897, the revenue of New
South Wales was £9,107,208. The population of New
South Wales at the end of the year 1896 was 1,297,640
persons. Therefore, according to Coghlan —and Dr.
MacLaurin’s arithmetical method—every man, woman,
and child in the community contributed £7 os. sd. to the
revenue of this country. A man with a wife and four
children contributed no less a sum than £42 2s. 6d. to the
revenue. But, if any man had the misfortune to have a
wife and eight children, he contributed in the year 1896-
1897 £7O 4s. 2d. to the revenue of this country. It is quite
useless for any man with a wife and eight children to pro-
test that he did nothing of the sort. Mr. Coghlan’s
figures —and Dr. MacLaurin’s method—prove that he did,
and cannot be refuted.
But Mr. Coghlan’s works contain other information,
which, interpreted in the light of Dr. MacLaurin’s
method, is full of interest. Of beer the family of every
man with a wife and eight children in New South Wales
consumed 91'4 gallons :of spirits 7’3 gallons, and of wine
61 gallons. No matter how earnestly a man may have
striven to live a strictly sober life—no matter how he may
have tried to keep alcohol out of his house—these figures
are correct, and the result (see Dr. MacLaurin) cannot be
disputed ; he and his family have consumed the amount
of beer, wines, and spirits mentioned.
Mr. Coghlan further estimated that in the year
1890 the private wealth of Australasia amounted to
£1,169,434,000. Now in 1890 there were 3,785,133 people
in Australasia ; therefore every man, woman, and child
in these colonies was worth £3OB ; and every man with a
wife and family of four children was worth with his
family £IB4B. These figures are guaranteed to be correct:
they are Mr. Cogiilan’s— interpreted in the light of Dr.
MacLaurin's method.
As to land. In 1897, in N.S.W. 45,738,687 acres of land
had been alienated or were in process of alienation ;
divided amongst our 1,323,460 people it is obvious that
every man, woman, and child in the community has
34-5 acres of land, and a man with a wife and family of
four has with his family 207 acres of land.
I find further that every man, woman, and child in the
colony was responsible for the production of ’02,842 of an
infant in the year 1897 ; and was charged with committing
•04,387 of an offence in the same year ; while each of us
was married -00,672 times, and died -01,158 times during
the year.
Dr. MacLaurin, by liiS own method of aver-
ages, is now invited to defend himself against
this charge of being the mother of a fraction
of an infant every year, and he is warned that
if that fraction of an infant is not produced he
w r ill be under dark suspicions of partial in-
fanticide.
The Horrors of Heydon.
Some of the very latest anti-Billiousisms by
that shining light, L. F. Heydon, M.L.0., as
reported in Sydney Telegraph of Ist June :
The Bill provided that Sydney should never be the
capital of N.S.W. . . . Next, the Bill required this
colony to raise £1,500,000 a year extra taxation, and give
it to other colonies not so well off. . . . Further, the Bill
provided that the other colonies should prevent us having
the control of our rivers, which would mean a great loss,
and the same with our railways. We were to be told
what rates we should charge. ... It was now generally
admitted that the extra tax per head on the people of
N.S.W. would be £1 2s. 6d. per head—Billites did not
deny that. . . . The whole object of the “ Braddon
Blot ” was for the Federal Treasurer to screw money out
of N.S.W. and give it to the other colonies.
The statement that the Bill prevents Sydney
being the capital of N.S.W. is a new effort of
inaccuracy, even for the appalling L. F. Heydon.
As regards the clause providing that N.S.W.
shall raise .£1,500,000 a year and give it to the
other provinces—well, L. F. Heydon couldn’t
point out that alleged clause if he depended on
it to get his soul off the perpetual gridiron in
Tophet. So, like a wise lawyer, he crawls
under the shelter of generalities and doesn’t
try. The Bill doesn’t “ provide that the other
colonies should prevent us having the control
of our rivers,” and anyone who says it does is
a Rougemont and a Psalmanazar and Mun-
chausen and a Tichborne Claimant and a
Pontoppidan and a sea-serpent. There is
only one clause (No. 100 in the amended Bill)
dealing with rivers, and what it says is that
“ the Commonwealth shall NOT, by any law
or regulation of trade or commerce, abridge the
right of a State or of the residents therein to
the reasonable use of the waters of rivers for
conservation or irrigation.” The solitary
clause in the Bill dealing with the matter was
put in to prevent N.S.W. being “deprived of
its rivers,” and all the fish-yarn and snake-
anecdote in the world can’t alter the fact.
Also, as to being “ told what rates we should
charge on our railways.” that simply means
that we shall tell other people w'hat rates they
will charge on their railways. It isn’t “ generally
admitted ” that N.S.W. will be taxed an extra
£1 2s. 6d. per head ; all the aggregate Pontop-
pidan and sea-serpent in the anti-Federal push
can’t alter the fact that the £1 2s. 6d. lie is
flatly denied. And, as to the whole object of
the Braddon clause being “ to screw money
out of N.S.W. and give it to other colonies,”
what the clause (No. 87) actually says is :
Of the net revenue of the Commonwealth from duties
of Customs and of excise not more than one-fourth shall
be applied annually by the Commonwealth towards its
expenditure.
The balance shall, in accordance with this Constitution,
be paid to the several States.
L. F. Heydon rises to add, in effect, the words :
“except the balance belonging to N.S.W.
which shall be paid over to the States.” But
there aren’t any such words in the Bill, and
even if the whole human race lost its soul
swearing that there are it couldn’t alter the
fact in the least.
The Queensland Bobby.
A Q. correspondent on the Q. police force :
Now that the Gatton farce has ended, and the incapa-
city of the portion of the “foorce” which conducted the
farce been fully demonstrated, a review of the collective
Bananaland cop. is to enliven the opening- of Parliament,
and the criticism will be mainly directed against the
“ ready-made ” officers who had the honor of bringing
the Gatton horror to such a successful issue-for the
criminals. The Bulletin is out of it when it remarks
“ that half the police force of Q. had either got to prove
that Burgess was there or admit itself a failure.” Not a
single experienced officer was told off for the work of
investigation, excepting, of course, the heavy-weight ser-
geant with the elastic memory, who lost notes and recol-
lection before the inquiry. The stupid blundering and
threatening to secure the attendance of Mrs. McNeil at
the court was a finale worthy of the whole show. The
woman was living at Gatton, where the inquiry was being
held, and her presence could have been forced in an hour,
or at least before any influence could have been used that
might militate against her giving reliable evidence, but
she was given four days' notice that she would be required.
Her husband atonce cameand tookheraway to Toowoomba
—after the notice had been served—and when she did
attend her evidence “ threw no light on the matter.”
It is a strange fact that the majority of the police seem
rather pleased than otherwise at the failure of the Gatton
heroes, as it bears out the opinion they hold of the “ kid-
glove officers.” The numerous mystery-enshrouded mur-
ders that have been committed during the past few years
bear out the contention that police “ability” in the
higher ranks is now a mere term with no significance.
Of about nine murders committed in West Q. the police
attempted to prosecute in two cases, and these they
blundered to pieces in the police-court. In one case —
the Grey Rock murder, near Aramac —they could not
even prove whether or not the man alleged to be mur-
dered was walking about the country or “ settled on the
land." And of some eighteen murders in the Maekay
district which are obscured in the same fog of police in-
competence, not one has yet been elucidated, though
the genial kanaka who flavors the sugar gets credit
for the job lot. Which is a nice, easy way of
accounting for murder in the bulk. The men who
join the Q. police-force nowadays do so because
they are out of work and want rations, and there is
no one more ready to joyfully admit the aforesaid
failures and the causes which led to them than the cop-
per himself. There is an absolute lack of incentive to
exertion in the way of prospective promotion, except to
those who occupy the position of Chief Goat Rider or
Ancient Stamp-Licker to the local lodge ; and, under the
present clean and effective system, Mongrelia is rapidly
becoming a paradise for criminals. The £480,000 worth
of police, annually, is demoralised, disorganised, and in a
perfect state of inertia. The majority sulk at favors
showered on men without one iota of merit. The ready-
made officer is the evil genius of the Q. police now, as he
has been for years past. Some time ago the Govt, crowd
attempted to cope with this evil by passing a Bill
making it compulsory that future promotions should
be from the ranks, but the wily Tozer (then Home-Sec.)
took no notice. In his last annual report to Parliament
the Commissioner raised a most pitiful whine, asking
for a free hand to govern the service, but this open
recognition of the existing evil, outside of causing a
rumpus, only served to intensify the curse and make
matters a trifle worse than they were before.
Queensland Labor-party is, on the whole,
favorable to Federation, but would prefer to see
electoral reform precede the passing of the
Enabling Bill. It can, however, scarcely be
deemed judicious to oppose the Bill on that
account, for a postponement of Federation is
not going to hasten electoral reform along.
Newfoundland was the only province that stayed
outside the Canadian confederation, and, in place
of progressing steadily into Liberalism, it drifted
back hopelessly into the most stupid Conserva-
tism, and sold itself, stock, lock and barrel,
the other day to a casual speculator. The idea
of Queensland, the one important Australian
province that has made practically no demo-
cratic progress for the last 15 years, refusing to
unite with states that have made enormous
strides in the direction of reform, from a fear
that reform in Bananaland will be thereby
blocked, is, indeed, highly amusing. If Queens-
land really means to keep herself “ white ” and
Australian, there’s only one course—join hands
with the white states around her.
Minister Chataway, of Queensland, gives,
without overtly intending it, some excellent
reasons for hurrying on Federation. He has been
on the Tweed and Richmond lately, in company
with N.S.W. Minister Cook, and made an im-
portant discovery. Where, he asks, are the kana-
kas who have not been returned to the islands
and who are not now on N.Q. sugar plantations?
Dead, used to be the answer. “ Not at all,”
says Chataway. “I myself found over 300
of them settled in N.S.W., just over the
border.” This is, probably, only a moiety of
the numbers that have percolated into what is
valiantly called white country. A uniform
law applied to all Australia can alone effectu-
ally secure a white Australia. While provinces
act independently of each other, the strength
of the group is merely the strength of the
weakest member, or of that member which,
while legislating to exclude or restrict, only
weakly enforces its laws.
A Maoriland correspondent on the recent
Marine Dept, scandals :
M.L. Marine Dept, has for years been run by landlub-
bers, who don’t know a handspike from a. deviascope,
with the result that some most astounding practices
have been carried on. Some of these came to light
the other day in the Supreme Court at Wellington.
Every old shellback who ever poled a punt about the
mud-flats of a Maoriland harbor has hitherto been able
to get a sea-going master’s certificate with ridiculous ease.
Here is a sample of how examinations have been con-
ducted. A local mariner was up for his certificate, and
was supposed to be closeted with the’examiners, when a
well-qualified captain friend of the examinee was sur-
prised at being rung up, with a request to come along
and help him, for he was “gravelled.” “But how can
I?” said the friend. “Oh, there’s nobody in the exami-
nation-room but myself.” Still the captain demurred,
and still the candidate implored. “ All right, then. You
come and meet me at the —— hotel ; bring the papers
and 111 fix ’em up.” Met accordingly ; papers overhauled.
“Blast and dash me! I’ve left the questions behind.
You wait till I fetch ’em.” Papers fetched ; answers
faked ; candidate returned without having been missed
by examiner, and, of course, passed triumphantly.
The case recently under judicial review was even more
glaring. A popular harbor skipper went up for a coast-
ing-master’s certificate, though he had forgotten, if he
ever knew, the elements of schooling. On examination
day, instead of sitting down to do the work, he produced
an envelope, from which he hauled somebody else’s replies
to the questions, and handed them to one, of the ex-
aminers. The other examiner walked out of the room ar.
this stage. According to examiner No. 1, what followed
was this : He was proceeding to tear up the bogus papers
when the examinee appealed to him as a man and a
brother. “ Thereupon,” added the examiner, “I weakly
yielded and accepted the papers.” Examiner No. 2
accepted the word of No. 1 that all was right, the candi-
date was passed and in due course received the coveted
certificate. This has since been cancelled by the
Court; and examiner No. 1 was cashiered by the Govt.
A desperate attempt is being made by the Tories to im-
plicate Ministers. Now, “ King Dick” was absent in
London when the thing was done, and the “scandal” was
sprung upon him as a complete surprise soon after his
return. Hall-Jones, the boneless man who is Minister of
Marine, has been hard pushed to explain a memo, which
he wrote on an envelope thus : “ Jones, Duco, permit
examination.” This, though unsigned, was accepted by
the officials as an instruction to allow Jones to go up*for
examination, although he had not the service qualifica-
tion necessary. They pronounce “ permit ” with the
accent on the “ mit.” H. J. says it was a mere note made
to refresh his memory, with a view to inquiring whether
he could waive the service qualification. He accents
“permit” on the first syllable. Thus, on a question of
syllabic quantity, rests the innocence or guilt of the
boneless Minister. Collateral evidence is against him,
for the Secretary of Customs says that the Minister’s ver-
bal instructions were to per mit the examination. Seddon
sticks to his colleague with the dogged fidelity for which
he is famous ; but the signs are that there will be very
rough weather when Parliament meets shortly—if Dick
doesn’t throw the Jonah overboard.
The “ White Man’s Burden ” in the Philip-
pines. Thus a recent cable :
Fourteen thousand American regular troops are about
to leave the U.S. to reinforce the troops under General
Otis in the Philippines.
It was reported from Hongkong that the
Americans had lost 7000 men (about a third
of their land force) by battle and disease since
the occupation of,Manila. They do not hold a
foot of ground beyond their lines of sentries,
and cannot advance into the interior beyond
the range of their ships’ guns. In 1802 Napo-
leon took up the “ White Man’s Burden.” He
sent his brother-in-law, Le Clerc, with 25,000
veterans of the army of Italy, to reduce the
revolted negroes of Hayti. Reinforcements at
the rate of nearly 5000 men a month were
poured into the island, till the total came
up to 100,000 men. In 1804, Rochambeatt,
who had commanded the French con-
tingent sent to America during the War of
Independence, withdrew with 8000 starving,
fever-stricken wretches—all that remained alive
—and Hayti was unconquered ! But modern
weapons and modern medical science have
changed the conditions. Have they ? A rifle
is not of much use in a scrub where you can’t
see ten yards ahead, as was shown in Samoa,
the other day, and medical science is helpless
in the presence of tropical fevers. The Ameri-
cans in the Philippines, like the French in
Hayti, are fighting less against human enemies
than against nature, climate, and disease.
Whether the American people will consent to
pay the butcher’s bill when they learn its pro-
bable amount is a question that only time can
decide.

Until there is a more liberal provision for
voting by post, the back-countryman will have
comparatively little say in Parliamentary elec-
tions and referendums. What happens every
time in such districts of N.S. W. as YVentworth
and Wilcannia and Barwon has just happened
in the way-out S.A. districts. In Flinders, for
instance, one of the best-fought electorates in
the province, Port Lincoln and Port Augusta
West are the chief polling - places. Port
Lincoln is a township; 407 of the 594 on
the roll voted —about a fair S.A. average. But
Port Augusta West is a big, scattered district,
where life consists mostly of fight with drought
and vermin, and only 154 of the 436 on the roll
came in. Smoky Bay, with 119 on the roll,
recorded 15 votes. In N.S. W. the squatter or
the bank’s bailiff often arranges work so that
“objectionable” and doubtful men cannot
reach a booth (he can tell who’s who by analys-
ing the last returns); but in S.A. it is simply
distance and drought which thus disfranchise
hundreds of the bravest battlers in the country.

Practically everything in the show in-
dustry of Sydney is as it was last week. Not one
theatre lias changed its programme to lend a
gleam of novelty to this column. And the natural
consequence will be that they will all change
Presently on the same night, and this influential
publication will be driven off its proper beer in its
efforts to be at six shows simultaneously, and
Wol ]t manage to be, in any coherent sense, at any
of them. Then indignant managers will write to
say that their show wasn’t properly considered,
because The Bulletin man had left (to do three
other shows) before the great scene in the 10th
act where the villain, finding himself foiled, com-
mitted suicide by boiling his head in a billy over
the gas-stove. If there were 45 theatres in
Sydney, the habit of all changing their bill on
the same night would probably be just as virulent
as it is now.

At the Royal Standard, in Castlereagh-
street (Sydney), the crude, raw-meat drama of
Sweeney Todd, the Demon Barber of Fleet-
street, ” nightly raises the hair and chills the blood
of fairly good houses. Sweeney Todd is a grue-
some Dead wood Dick sort of person, with a
raucous voice and a trapdoor underneath the seat
where he drags off the public hair for a small con-
S i e u a^on -' Clients who have money in their
Rothes disappear down the trap with dreadful
suddenness. What becomes of them afterwards is
not quite clear, but it is strongly hinted that they
wander round London in the shape of veal-pies.
010 aa ° W °P ens w hen a mariner, loaded with a
*12,000 pearl necklace, wanders into Todd’s for a
shave, and shows the dreadful barber the treasure.
Me goes down the trap. His girl squirms and
weeps for him—not for the pearls. Sundry other
people go down the trap ; and barber Todd waxes
fat, but becomes troubled in his mind as to
what to do with his apprentice, Tobias
Bagg, who knows too much. Why he hesi-
tates to send him down the trap" is a mys-
tery; but, anyhow, he doesn’t, and, instead,
he takes him to the private mad - house of Mr.
. °SS- The acting of Mr. Percy Walshe as Fogg
/fv? tr u nge * y out place in the dull little theatre
(the best seats are only a shilling); it is really
clever. There is a street-corner scene in which
Tobias Ragg (Miss Eva St. Clair) sings and
dances, and Mr. Charles Carrington, as Jarvis
Williams, plays the larrikin to perfection. Owing
to some hitch in the underground arrangements
the man of many pearls was not turned into veal
pies, and brings the gruesome Barber to utter
smash, madness, and confession by suddenly
appearing in court just as that worthy is fastening
the guilt of his murder and robbery on the other
man who was after his best girl. Then the cur-
tain comes down on a series of hugs and inter-
jections.

Brough’s “ Liars ” are finishing their third
week at Sydney Royal, and, as they are not likely
to last much longer, the general public is cordially
urged to go and hear their prevarication before it
is too late. Holloway’s ‘‘Soldier and a Man”
pursues the explosive tenor of its way at the
Lyceum, and no change is yet announced. At the
11 nu’ Bryde has been having a great fare-
well benefit—-at least, she was just going to have
it when this issue went to press, and, unless some-
thing went wrong, she has had it by now; and The
Bulletin hopes it did the vigorous Tttle woman
much good.

Harry Conor, the brightest member of the
old ‘‘Trip to Chinatown ” co. is coming to Sydney
with an American combination and some more
American comedies. The ‘‘Chinatown” co. was
largely a stout man’s combination—Whistler Law-
ton and the oppressed worm who played the man-
servant being the chief exceptions—and Welland
Strong was the happiest stout man in the lot, so
Sydney will doubtless be glad to see him back.
.Lhe opening date is June 17 at Her Majesty’s
consequently the “ Belle of New York ” will move
along some time next week. Neither the lunatic,
nor the Queen of “ kammic appera,” nor the
silent, oppressive fat man will be much regretted
but The Bulletin has a left-off tear—a ready-
made slop tear which never fitted comfortably—
that it will shed over the Salvation girl and gaunt
father Ichabod.

Sardou’s five-act play, the “Flesh and the
Devil,” is in preparation at Sydney Criterion, and
will appear on a date not yet fixed. The Beef and
Satan are quite new to Sydney. Meanwhile the
soft hand of Time has softened down most of the
ruts in the present production—or rather it has
considerably levelled the one big rut which made
the ‘ Three Musketeers ” such an aggravation on
first night. It is a fine, picturesque drama, and if
it had started with everybody in a state of perfect
rehearsal and with somebody like the much-re-
gretted Scot Inglis as the lean brown swordsman
i?™ Gascony, it ought to have been a great boom
all through. There is only one point where the
stage arrangements seem to strike a rock, so to
speak. The King’s musketeers are just the crowd
of gaudy, flashy revellers and fighters that most
people expected a crowd of explosive gentlemen
always calling for wine and for the whole globe to
come and tread on the tails of their baggy boots.
And their enemies, the Cardinal’s guards, ought
to be something after the same pattern—therefore
th© four mechanical, straight-up-and-down supers.
who represent them are an anachronism.
It is just impossible f( he gaudy, roaring, swash-
bucklering musketeer.': have a deadly feud with
these wooden persons in brown suits ; they might
as reasonably nave a death-struggle with a hymn-
book, or a jug of water, or a tailor’s lay-figure.
Still, the Cardinal's guards are not on view long
enough to matter much, and, as the Meat and the
Fiend are due very shortly, it is rather late to
complain.

“The Guv’nor,” a comedy which revolves
round a young man with a stutter, and a stone-
deaf boat-builder who admits most compromising
charges relating to a lady’s character under the
impression that the wronged husband is asking
the price of a boat, is to be produced at Sydney
Opera House shortly— most probably this Satur-
day. Till then, the key of the bedroom will be
lost down the fainting lady’s back as heretofore.

Orpheus M‘Adoo, the Jubilee Singer man,
is bringing another company of colored artists to
Sydney, and opens at the Palace sometime this
month. The new co- is described as being a mar-
vellous combination of musical and dramatic
ability, and considering that Orpheus M‘A. has
hitherto contrived to live up to his promises better
than most showmen, The Bulletin hopes for the
best.

Many people who have missed that bright
and clever little actress, Miss Amy Gourlay, from
her usual haunts at Sydney Lyceum, will regret to
hear that her present address is a private hospital
m Macleay-street, where she has been undergoing
a serious operation. Also, they will be pleased to
hear that the operation has been perfectly suc-
cessful, and Miss Gourlay is in a fair way to re-
covery. At the same time, the sombre class of
people who like to brighten up a sick-bed—
especially that of a complete stranger—with tracts
and pious remonstrance about the sinfulness of
being an actress, are informed that the young lady
is not yet well enough for bitter religious contro-
versy. Tracts and sich may, however, be ad-
dressed to her, and left in the ash-receptacle
beside the back-gate.

Bland Holt’s long descent, feet-foremost,
into the realistic tank, likewise the water picnic
where Brown sits on the saveloys, and the gentle
Gussie who meets his best barmaid in a pawnshop,
and the loading-up of the newspaper carts with
extra-speshul editions of the Orful Shipwreck,
also the abnormal 4-year-old infant, and many
other illustrations of “How London Lives” are
getting along briskly at Melbourne Royal. Bland
Holt s domestic drama includes a large assortment
of articles for household use, and the hypo-
thecation of these various necessaries at a
hook-nosed “uncle’s” is watched with much
human interest. Moreover, the large infant
saying its prayers in the limelight under a mistaken
impression that dear mother has gone to Heaven,
whereas she is merely tearing her hair in full view
of her offspring—this is a spectacle which helps to
agitate the family-circle and turn money away
from the pit on Saturday nights. Further con-
sideration of “ How London Lives ” has hardened
I he Bulletin’s admiration for Brunton’s scenery,
and this journal would be prepared to forgive all
the defects in the story if it made suitable provi-
sion for the future of Mrs. Bland Holt. Fate is
altogether too rough on Mrs. Holt. At the be-
ginning, she is a high-toned parlormaid, or some-
thing, but next act she gets the “chuck,” as she
calls it, on account of her Christian conduct to the
widow and the fatherless, after which she sells
newspapers on Ludgate Hill, and answers to the
name of “ Watcheer Polly ! ” Nobody wants to
marry her, with the exception of a man who wal-
lows in beer, so the chances are that she will ulti-
mately get run over by a cart and be taken to a
norspital to die. The Bulletin is not going to
whoop for any drama in which Mrs. B. H. doesn’t
end happily.

The whirling washtub continues to tickle
the chair that twirls the broom that revolves on
the brow of “Shinky” and the juggler who
startled Melbourne into crying Bravo the first
night he appeared at the Bijou is now getting
Bravoed more than ever. Cinquevalli is a feast of
novelties, and a flow of silent jokes. On Satur-
day he casually kicked a waistcoat from the
ground into the air, and the garment landed on
his body just as though a ghostly tailor had
guided him through the armholes. Cinquevalli
threw a watch and chain thirty or forty feet above
his head, and the ticker struck him fair in his
vest pocket when it fell. But these are mere
details. The Comical Four are back at the Bijou,
pursued by the live ham and the leg of mutton
that walks in its sleep.

“ The Forty Thieves ” are to march round
and round for another week at Melb. Princess’s,
and then the Firm reverts to romantic drama. On
June 17 the perambulating Hoolev-person in the
green bell-topper will be replaced by a more in-
teresting figure. “ The King’s Musketeer ”is
said to be about the best of several recent drama-
tisations of Dumas’s bulky narrative, and the cos-
tumes “will be found extravagantly rich,” says
the advt., and the re-appearance of Miss Hen-
rietta Watson as leading lady at the Princess’s is
calculated to give pleasure to all.

The alarming intimation that Dante’s last
nights are passing hence, like the lady who ter-
minates in steam, has served to awaken the drowsy
outer circle of public to a sense of its responsi-
bility. Those who hadn’t seen Dante before, but
had heard about him all the time, are now rolling
into St. George’s Hall with great energy, therefore
the last nights of that deep dissembler are likely
to be prolonged by General Desire after the man-
ner of their kind. Generals Desire and Request
are the two finest warriors in the whole of the
Show service.

There is now something like £2OOO (raised
solely by concerts) to the credit of the fund for
sending Miss Amy Castles to Europe, with a view
of turning her into a Patti, or as near thereto as
possible. _ Sydney is ready to hear Miss Castles,
so is Brisbane and so are all the rest of the
big and little towns; for she has been
boomed with a vengeance. Here comes in
the mining adage about the wisdom of selling a
mine on a good face. In the future the Bendigo
girl s 'voice may be anything or nothing, but cer-
•? in a I V s , tbat lf ber tide is tak en for her at
its Hood she can, without damage to her voice,
within the next few months compile in Australia,
say £5OOO or £OOOO more, which, when invested,
wi 1 give her an assured life income of several
hundreds a year ! What folly to let such an
opportunity go by. A bird in the hand is worth
two song-birds in the bush.
At Poverty Point.
Melb. ’; The Old Colonists’ demonstration to Coppin
was a hollow kind of fnnciion. Made me think of the
time when Harry Taylor and Harry Collier were report-
iri!>- on the Ask. Collier was a particular enthusiast for
Coppin. Taylor was hostile to him, as a politician. Coppin
stood for Richmond. Collier was anxious to report him,
and said, “ If Taylor goes he’ll put Coppin out somehow,
sure as a gun.” But Taylor was sent to the first meetings
ISext morning the first words of Coppin’s speech, in the
Age, were “Here we are again !’’ Coppin declared he
never uttered them. They spoilt his election. He had
been abjuring the stage, and people said, “ Ah, there he
is, you see ! The old clown ! ”
“Jinda”: A rather poor Australian variety co. (five
women and three men) were at latest playing at the
Garden of Eden theatre, Noumea. Dropped in for an
hour one evening. One perfect lady (Australian), when
half way through the song-and-darice business, jumped
o\ er footlights and nearly brained an Englishman
with a chair. He was drunk, and was showing the girl
and audience some new steps and high kicks. Before
assaulting him, she, in good old N.S.W. language, told
him not to make a “blauky fool of himself,” One per-
former, whose turn wasn’t appreciated by the Frenchmen,
calmly looked at ’em and remarked, “ the
lot of yer ! ”
A malicious mummer to The Bulletin The Belle
of N. York,” which ran a whole year in London to great
business, shows the advantages of ignorance. Had a
clever man been offered such a piece he would have said :
“No ; take it away and burn it quickly. Slowly burn the
author also.’ The music, where not reminiscent of
“ Grandfather’s Clock ’’ and other classics, is in bars, and
must have been composed by the German lunatic when
he was not sharpening his knife. The German idiot is
really the only artist in the show. His dress is his weak
point : he should wear a frock-coat, short pants, and
peaked-cap, for German idiots in America cling to
Fatherland in dress, and do not wear brown tweed busi-
ness suits or tan boots. Mr. Kenningham and Blinky
Bill also wear tweed suits which evidently came from the
same shop ; and this trio of widely-different characters
would, with the grease-paint off, look like Lands-office
clerks.
A musical Melb. man tells an amusing story of the
Castles boom. One morning, shortly before the Bendigo
damsel’s first appearance at the Town Hall, the gent, in
question was waited upon by a lady who offered “Amy
Castles concert ” . tickets for sale. He told his visitor
that he hadn’t heard of the songstress, whereupon she
expressed astonishment at his ignorance. Amy Castles,
she said, was “ the most wonderful singer in the world.”
He didn’t bite, and the fair canvasser took a haughty
departure. Ilalf-an-hour later another pushing sales-
woman invaded his office with more tickets for the Amy
Castles concert. “ You must come and hear her, she's
the finest singer in Australia,”' chirped the new bar-
racker. “Just now I was told that Miss Castles is the
finest singer in the world,” said the unyielding man, who
had begun to wonder what game they were playing
on him, anyway. “ Well,” replied canvasser Ho. 2, “ and
so she is, of course.”
The discoverer of Amy Castles is again on the war-path.
She has two voices this time to produce—one a contralto
of extraordinary richness, and the other “a voice of even
more unique quality than Amy Castles’!” Both these
gifted vocalists will be heard in Melbourne shortly.
A touch of unconscious irony has crept into that seem-
ingly purely farcical piece, “ Dr. Bill,” as played at
Sydney Opera House. When the Police Superintendent,
towards the end, informs the worried medico that, besides
the charge of attempted murder, there will he a still more
serious one of pocket-picking, the law’s estimate of the
respective values of property and person didn’t knock the
King-street audience as it ought to have done.
Dorothy Vane is not going into a convent yet awhile.
She has just signed with the Firm for another 12 months,
at the end of her present year’s engagement.
Julius Knight was essentially a footlight and grease-
paint man. Off the hoards the clear cutting”of his
features blurred into sallowness and insignificance, and
his stature dwarfed into almost meanness. Now, Gaston
Mervale, even in garish daylight, might have passed for a
real gipsy king. Marcus J. created nothing, left nothing.
Deduction, he was not worth a gush as an actor. His
send-off savored of Ameriean-Spanish heroism. After
his last performance he had to run the gauntlet of a lane
of neurotic, clamoring women from the stage-door to the
tram. He tickled or shook hands with as many as he
could reach.
June 2nd was the fourth anniversary of Violet Varley’s
death.
Dear Bullettn.— Your Poverty Pointer, who comments
on the excessive air of propriety of the Harm.v girl in
“ Belle of New York,” seems to suppose that Miss Hep-
ner wits expected to make a study from life. She merely
followed instructions re “ looking modest,” and inasmuch
as her line has been principal boy, she took her ideas of
demureness from the stage-manager, no doubt. He
would say, “ Walk very slowly, cast, your eyes down, and
when you raise them he careful to' put lots of earnest
piety into your gaze ’’—and the scrumptious Miss Louise
does it very nicely. If she lays the religious color on a
leetle too thick, the fault is on the right side. All stage
colors are painted with a full brush. The unhappy
heroines are impossibly patient and resigned, or much
too picturesquely agitated, as the case may be. The
noble hero makes an unnatural display of courage and
magnanimity, and the first purpose of the stage villain is
to call the attention of the gallery to his awful wicked-
ness.—E.
Fred Villiers will soon be back in Australia with his
furious mo and other warlike appendages. His lecture
this time will be “Khartoum at Last,” describing how
Gen. Kitchener and Villiers won the battle of Omdurman.
Tenor Kenningham is said to have been very eager to
join the “Belle of New York” co. For some months,
though still under contract with the Firm, he was doing
nothing, and the tenor complained bitterly that his voice
was being allowed to rust. M'Guckin and many other
visiting singers would have been glad to rest on the same
terms, but Kenningham is a youngish man with voice
still fresh and probably at its artistic best.
Conjuror Dante ought to give Sunday-night lectures
on Mormonism. His father is manager of a big jewellery-
manufacturing business in Salt Lake City, and Dante
made his first important appearance at the Grand Opera
House in that much-married metropolis. The conjuror
must have a large stock of anecdotes re Brigham Young
and the Mormon elders. His father built for Brigham a
watch that required no winding at all, the spring being
worked by the opening and shutting of the case-lid. If
he thought the ticker had nearly run down Brigham
would ask one of his missuses to take it out and look at
the time.
London is lucky in getting two good new plays at
once. Pinero’s “ The Gay Lord Quex ”is called a miracle
of stagecraft; Haddon Chambers’ “The Tyranny of
Tears” a triumph of comedy. In the third act of
“ Quex” there is a bedroom scene between the gay lord
and a lady, with another woman spying behind the door,
which has moved critics to raptures and a bishop to
denunciation. Now, we like bedroom scenes in Aus-
tralia, Messrs. Williamson and Brough.
‘•A year ago the people gave a decided
vote against the Bill.”— From Sydney Telegraph
report of speech by S. J. Law, M.P. The Bulle-
tin has great pleasure in reporting that the above
is an unspeakable lie, whether Law said it or the
D.T. said it for him. N.S.W. gave a decided
majority of over 5000 for the Bill. Parliament
disqualified that majority, and many liars of the
Geo. Pile’s dog party have since gone about lying
to the effect that tnere wasn’t one, but it was there
all the same.
Someone broke into The Bulletin office
last week and got away with some small trifles,
and made an amateur effort to burgle a big steel
safe, the locks whereof were so jammed that not
all the talent of Botany Bay—where there ought
to be first-class safe-breaking talent—can open it.
The attempt on the safe was no doubt made upon
the supposition that it contained money ; to save
labor in future, it may be as well to say that money
isn’t kept in that big safe. This paper never did
hold a very high opinion of the Colonists’ Anti-
Bill League.
W. B. Melville, journalist, who is stand-
ing for the vacant Northumberland seat in the
Federal interest, has already done the cause one
good service. It was he who dug out the fact
that Sydney Telegraph, before the famous
Secret Conference took place, demanded most
emphatically that the conference should be
secret, and alleged that there was no other
right way of fixing up the Bill. That
was before it had its own Secret Conference of
directors, and before it found out that the Federal
capital wasn’t to be in Sydney—a circumstance
which, if the Bill passes, will cost it ,£5OOO a year
in telegraphing its Federal Parliamentary reports.
Dear Bulletin. —Stand by and hear me :
The lugubrious Geehung doth protest too much. When
any paper, with any pretensions to a knowledge of his-
tory, declares that the Constitution cannot be altered,
that it is for all time and eternity, and our children's
children, and all the rest of the drivel, it is time to fire
that paper into the dirt-box and place a big brick on it to
keep it there. No Constitution is immovable, and our
children and children’s children will probably be quite
capable of looking after themselv s. Any Constitution
that is irksome to the great wen thy province, N.S.W.
—where we all wear opals on the e, dsofourmoustachios,
and clank along our marble streets arrayed in silk and
gold—must be a hundredfold more so to the other pro-
vinces which are destitute and bankrupt,, where the
people are naked, have no education, and never see a
sovereign in their short miserable lives, and where all
the wealth and property is held by men from N.S.W.
Any Constitution that is a curse and a plague to the
whole continent will promptly get short notice and a long
kick. Also, as the Constitution Bill provides that taxa-
tion must be uniform throughout the Commonwealth, it
is impossible to get more than her fair share out of
N.S.W. Dr. MacLiurin lately told us that any attempt to
take for the benefit of the smaller States any surplus be-
lonying to N.S.W. can be blocked by the Supreme Court,
and that any extra expense to N.S.W. can only be
brought about by an act of robbery, so surely we can go
to our little pearl-inlaid and eider-down-quilted beds and
sleep without fear. If the “lame ducks” do invade us
and try to cart away this great country and all its vast
deficits, no doubt the Imperial Govt, will come to our
rescue should we be unable to defend ourselves against
the weak, undersized, underfed, bankrupt people of Vic-
toria, Tasmania, South and West Australia.—Hermes
If the Queensland Parliament again decides to
stand out of Federation (and at time of writing
affairs were still very uncertain) and the other
provinces go on without her, she will lose in
five different ways : Her sugar will almost cer-
tainly be subject £o a duty on its entrance into
the Commonwealth, whereas, if Queensland
joined, its product would get in free. It may
almost entirely lose its hold on the Southern
market. When Queensland and Fiji are both
outside, and their sugar is subject to the same
duty, the cheapest nigger will get the trade.
And Fiji is pushing business so fast that it looks
as if it might, to a great extent, oust Queensland
from the Southern markets, duties being equal
If the Federal Parliament decides to impose a
stock-tax, Queensland’s cattle will also be shut
out. And when these disadvantages have
driven Queensland to come in later on it will
have lost the right to have equal representation
in the Federal Senate, not being an Original
State. Also, it will have lost its chance of
taking a hand in the fixing of the Federal
capital, and any show it might have had to get
it planted in northern N.S.W., close to its own
door, will have vanished. Queensland has
already, by its own hesitation, lost its chance
of having a voice in the making of the Federal
Constitution, and if it hesitates again it may
lose a good many more golden opportunities.

For the eleven months Queensland’s surplus of
revenue over expenditure was £793,264. Amount of loan
expenditure is kept strictly dark, but it is believed to be
very large. S.A. has supplied no information as to ex-
penditure or revenue since the end of March, that
abjectly slow province only issuing its figures quarterly,
and the amount of its loan expenditure is usually an un-
known quantity till the end of the year. Victoria sends
along-its monthly revenue returns promptly, but it issues
no returns of ordinary or loan expenditure till the end of
the year. The same stupid system prevails in Tasmania.
Westralia publishes monthly expenditure returns, but
they are seldom available till the middle of the month.
Maoriland publishes quarterly revenue returns, and even
these are often some weeks late, while its expenditure is
also buried in gloom till the end of the year. Why can’t
all these slow and reticent people follow rhe prompt and
business-like policy of N.S.W. Premier Reid, whose state-
ments of revenue and ordinary and loan expenditures
come out punctually on the Ist of every month, and are
available in all the papers on the 2nd ?
The N.S.W. deficit, which stood at .£574,724 a
month ago, is now down to £147,746, and it begins to
look as if a surplus was among the possibilities of the
case. Still even now things are £161,484 worse than they
were at this time last year ; on 31st May, 1898, Premier
Reid had'a surplus of £13,738 instead of the present big
shortage. The loan expenditure for the 11 months is
£1,837,577 ; so, as compared with the same 11 months of
last financial year, ordinary expenditure has increased
£301,908, and loan expenditure £304,552. In other words,
expenditure has increased over £606,000, while revenue
has only improved by £140,000. These things look very
bad for the finances of that monetary shuffler and bogus
economist, the dreadful G. Reid. The present will be the
worst year for loan-expenditure that N.S.W. has seen
since 1892.
Tasmania’s revenue-boom is apparently about
over. For three months in succession the revenue has
been moving downwards, and, though there is nothing
very serious as yet, it isn’t likely that-the 1899 receipts
will be up to the figure for 1898. Under these circum-
stances, the demand of the Opposition for a reduction in
taxes is very ill-timed. An Opposition can always get a
little cheap popularity by demanding a reduction of taxes
and leaving the Government to face the consequences,
but if the Braddon Ministry goes down over this question
it will probably be a bad spec, for Tasmania. The Braddon
Ministry has at least shown grit in facing a difficult finan-
cial situation, and most of its opponents have all its offen-
sive Toryism without the grit.

The Scottish Metropolitan Life Assurance
Society, onejof the very few British companies doing life
business in Australia, issues its balance-sheet for 1898.
The figures of the life department compare with some
previous returns as follows (consideration for annuities is
included in premiums) :
Net Life Total Life Added
Premiums. Interest. Income. to Funds.
1895 .. £59,819 £10,556 £70,375 £23,872
1896 .. 61,585 11,816 73,401 32,587
1897 .. 63,877 13,156 77,033 29,171
1898 .. 68,911 14,993 83,904 53,392
The large increase in the insurance fund last year is partly
owing to a curious extraneous circumstance. During the
year the Scottish Metropolitan made a new issue of shares,
raising its paid-up capi al from £28,500 to £BO,OOO, and
part premium on theseshares(£ls,lo7) was handed over by
the shareholders to put the insurance-fund in a better
position. Hitherto the Scottish Metropolitan has based
its calculations on the assumption that its funds would
earn in the future 4 per cent, interest. According to
British ideas, this is a ridiculously high rate to assume,
but at previous investigations the Scottish Metropolitan
was almost forced to keep on assuming it. It hadn’t
the necessary surplus funds without trenching on capi-
tal to enable it to reduce estimates. In 1885 its sur-
plus of assets over all liabilities was only £4030, and
no bonus was paid. In 1888 the surplus was £4196 —an
increase of only £166 in three years and again no
bonus was paid. In 1893 the surplus was £2342, so in five
years things had got £1854 worse—and once more no
bonus was paid. As the Scottish Metropolitan aims
rather at low premiums than at bonuses, the absence of a
bonus mattered little, though the decline in the surplus
was a serious matter.
In 1898, however, things had so much improved
that there was a surplus of £17,388. To reduce the
interest estimates from the eminently unsafe 4 per cent,
to 3J (even the latter figure is too high according to the
usual British practice) required £25,417, so wen if there
had again been no bonus, the surplus wasn’t nearly large
enough for the purpose. But the reduction was effected
by taking 115,107 of the shareholders’ money, as explained
above, and £10,310 out of the surplus ; another £40(10 or
so of the surplus is used to pay a small bonus, and there
is about £3OOO to carry forward.
Though the Scottish Metropolitan has made a
decided improvement in the last five years, it still looks
like an office whose premiums are too low for safety—or
would be too low if it hadn’t the shareholders’
capital to fall back upon. For instance, out of £14,993
interest earned in 1893, £7lO goes in dividends to share-
holders, leaving £14,283 for policy-holders. This is equal
to about 4 per cent, on the average funds, and the esti-
mate of future interest at 3J leaves a margin of ss. per
cent, to provide for a possible further drop in interest.
No Australian co. of any standing’ works on a lower
margin than 12s. per cent. —the A.M.P., City Mutual,
and Maoriland State office have a margin of £1 4s.
per cent. And the Scottish Metropolitan wouldn’t
have been able to reduce its estimates even to 3J
per cent, if it hadn’t adopted the extraordinary ex-
pedient of taking 115,000 out of the shareholders’ money.
If it is necessary to reduce estimates to 3J4 P er cent, it
can hardly rely on another windfall, and yet according
to all British ideas they should be reduced to 3£ per cent,
---or even 3 per cent. And the low premiums which did
little more than make ends meet on a 4 per cent, estimate
won’t make them meet so well on a 3J per cent, estimate.
The expense rate (nearly 20 per cent, on premiums and 16
per cent, on total income) is moderate according to Aus-
tralian ideas, and the investments look good, but the one
weak point about the Scottish Metrop. is its premium
rates. It has cut these down lower than any other
reputable office in Britain or Australasia has dared to
do (such humorous offices as the Abstainers and General,
the British Natural Premium and the Mutual Reserve
Fund can’t be reckoned as reputable) and it seems
probable that it has carried the process rather far for
safety.

The TjUJ.letin has before it a certain paper con-
nected with the “ Industrial Medical Benefit Assurance
Society,” of 88 Pitt-street, Sydney. It seems to be quite
a new society—at least, writer can’t find it in the Sydney
Directory for 1899. This concern goes in for “ life and
accident insurance, compensation during illness, and free
medical advice and medicine.” It asks the public to pay
up to 2s. 3d. per week according to age, and in return for
this it offers a good deal —on paper. A married man of
34 may pay Is. 6d. per week (t 3 18s. per year), and the
effusive society promises £l5 on his own death, £lO on his
wife’s death, from £3 to £5 according to age on the death
of a child, £1 per week during total disablement by acci-
dent, blood-poisoning, measles, pneumonia, scarlet fever,
smallpox, typhus or typhoid, also medical attendance for
member, wife, and children under 16. Also, “no person
will be objected to on account of his occupation 1 .”
This document in which the “Industrial Medical
Benefit Assurance Society ” appeals to the public to send
in its money doesn’t contain the name of anybody as
manager, secretary, auditor, director, medical officer,
banker, or the name of any responsible person whatever.
The date when the society started isn’t mentioned, and
nothing is said about the accumulated funds. The “ Head
Office, 88 Pitt-street,” consists apparently of one small
room upstairs, and there is no mention of any branch
office anywhere. There is a fat gentleman in that soli-
tary room (you find your way to it by following the direc-
tion on a little tin plate). Tun Bulletin doesn’t know
who the fat g-entleman is. The prospectus doesn’t state
that there is any capital, paid-up or otherwise, or any
shareholders, or any security for the payment of any-
thing except the bare word of that solitary fat gentleman
whose name this paper doesn’t know. The present scribe
wrote to the “ Industrial Medical Benefit Assurance
Society ” asking for the names of manager and directors
and particulars as to capital (if the affair was a
proprietary concern), and he has so far only reoeived in
answer a large quantity of dead silence. Perhaps his
letter miscarried in the post. And this paper’s emissary
has failed to trace the registration of the society at the
Registrar-General’s office. So far as all the evidence The
Bulletin has at command goes, it certainly looks as if the
Industrial Medical Benefit Assurance Society consisted of
one fat man in a rather humble room, collecting the pre-
miums, and giving his own unsupported assurance that
claims will be duly met, and auditing and managing him-
self on his own responsibility. It may not be so, but it
certainly looks that way.
One notable feature is the proviso, in the scanty
document which this paper has before it, that: “ Should
a subscribing member, his wife, or any of his children,
die before a period of six months from the date of his
joining the society shall have elapsed, the policy will
not be in benefit”—in other words, the society pays
nothing. Also : “ For a period of six months from the
date of joining the society, a subscribing member will
not be entitled to any sick allowance during temporary
total disablement so here also the society pays nothing.
And again : “ Subscribing members are entitled to free
medical attendance and medicine after the lapse of four
weeks from joining society.” There may be nothing in
this, but if Tiie Bulletin was a very hard-up fat or lean
man, or other man, and were starting a spec, of this kind,
it would put in a clause like that. For, otherwise, a
member might die before there were enough premiums in
to meet his claim, and the “society” might get into
trouble right away. On the whole, this paper reckons it
is high time there was some kind of State supervision over
life-assurance in Australia, in order to prevent mysteries
like the “ Industrial Medical Benefit Assurance Society ”
from collecting the coppers of the poor and ignorant. A
life-assurance society, above all other institutions, should
furnish solid and visible evidence of its reliability—some-
thing more than a room and a desk and a fat man.

The Intercolonial Investment, Land and Build-
ing Co. (Sydney) publishes another prosperous balance-
sheet, though despite its prosperity the falling away in
profits reflects the hard nature of the times. The net
earnings for the half-year to 30th April are £2014, which
compare with some previous returns as follows :

The half-year’s profits are equal to about £l2 2s. per cent,
per annum on the paid-up capital of £33,304, and after
paying the 7 per cent, dividend there is £854 to carry
forward. With previous balance this makes £3345 at
credit of profit and loss. During the past 71 years the
Intercolonial has set aside £4500 to cover depreciation ;
created a dividend equalisation fund of £2250 ; added
£5200 to reserve, making it £10,200 ; and added £2058 to
its accumulated profit balance. Its total reserves are now
over £lB,OOO. Also, since ’92 it has reduced its liability
to depositors from £20,900 to £10,193 ; bank overdraft
from £7030 to £933 ; and other liabilities from £22,731 to
£1629. If it doesn’t feel proud and satisfied under all
these pleasant circumstances it is its own fault.

A month ago the London Bank of Australia
gave notice that it was about to repay the instalment
(about I 320,000) of its 4J pe» cent, reconstructed deposits,
which falls due in July, 1901. It now announces the re-
payment of the similar instalment due in 1903. These
two transactions should save between £6OOO and £9OOO a
year in interest, which ought to do a lot to lift the
London Bank out of the rut of misfortune.

The liquidator of the awful Standard Bank
(Melb.)—which reconswindled three times and then
finally collapsed—lately filed a supplementary report
in the Supreme Court which contains some choice
items. This bank’s Assets Realisation Co. seems to
have been a most casual and happy-go-lucky affair
from the start. It did not even go to the trouble
of opening a new set of books, but simply carried on
those of the old defunct bank without a break. From
the report There never has been a true balance-sheet
of this co. published from start to finish. ... 1 turned
up the index of the general ledger for ‘ Directors’ fees ’—
no such account ; next, salaries—no account ; next,
management—no account. Asked manager whether such
existed. ‘ Oh,’ said he, ilhey are all under the head of
“ Charges”.’ In this ‘charges ’ account I found such en-
tries as directors’ fees, caretakers’ wages, insurance
guarantees, stationery, charwoman, law-costs, and soda-
water. . . . The sum of £9OO was paid to chairman-of-
directors Langton as expenses to England and Scot-
land on a mission that could have been accom-
plished by letter. . . In wading through the
‘charges’ account to ascertain the amount of directors’
fees, I found that the managing directors had been twice
paid the sum of £l4 11s. Bd.—which amount was paid by
the bank, accepted by the managing-director, and passed
by the auditors.” The Realization Co. has so far realised
£273,766 odd, and the liquidator suggestively remarks,
“How this money has been disposed of is a matter for
investigation.” Th? chairman of this boom-bank (Ed.
Langton) when he stood for Parliament at Toorak and at
Carlton South was violently supported by the Arous as
“one of our foremost financiers,” and “a man whose
presence would be a distinct gain to the House.” Truly,
these alleged financiers of the boom were only tin-pot
traders at best, and didn’t know much beyond the fact
that two and two made five for themselves and three for
the other fellow.

The Equitable Permanent Benefit Building
Land and Saving Institution (Sydney) earned £7BlO profits
for the year ended 31st March, 1899. This enables it to
pay a 9 per cent, dividend to paid-up shareholders, and 8
per cent, to contributing shareholders, and have a balance
of £1447, which, added to amount already on hand, leaves
£4946 at credit of profit and loss. The capital is £70,795
and total reserves are £28,339. The Equitable P.8.8.L.
and 8.1. pays its big dividends and bears up against the
blighting effect of its own initials, mainly because it has
no overdraft, and none of its assets are mortgaged, and it
has never gone in for owning more property than it could
pay for.

The big Melbourne concern of L. Stevenson and
Sons, Limited, decides to give up what ghost is left and
liquidate. In recent times this boom firm has made pro-
fits averaging from Is. 6d. to 11s. per cent, per annum.
But it had an accumulated loss of about £75,000 to work
off, and at the recent rate of progress the next dividend
appeared likely to come along in 50 years, so the share-
holders lost patience and gave up.

Everybody is saying that the price of copper is
like’y to be maintained. Ivnox, acting-chairman of Mt.
Lyell, said so at the shareholders’ meeting recently, al-
though he was careful not to figure future production and
profits on it. It is everybody’s interest to say so. People
who have no interest in the copper-market say nothing.
The Economist (London) says very large profits have been
made by the leaders of the copper-boom, but declares
that break-down is inevitable. One leading English cop-
per house reports that the French consumption for the
first three months of this year fell 25 per cent., that of
England 22J per cent. But actual consumption cannot
be got at. Necessarily it is estimated by sales, and with
the jump from £55 to t'7B, no doubt consumers started to
eat into their stocks in anticipation of a fall in price.
Figures of consumption will, for the latter part of the
year, probably be as great as.those of the first part appear
small. The Times says the American combination of
copper-mine owners is far from constituting the machinery
for producing even a partial “ corner.” Perhaps not,
but with three great mines in America they control about
half of the world's copper production and, at say, £75 per
ton they would probably make as big a profit with half
the former output—a very big consideration if the lives of
the mines are easily measurable. Saturday Review
says the policy of the promoters of the American com-
bination is to obtain a profit by re-selling their shares and
in order to do this they will allow the mines to earn the
maximum profit possible, that they do not intend to
force the price so high as to restrict consumption and
necessitate a reduction of the output, but to maintain the
price at a level which will allow comsiunption to go on
freely. One effect of the big copper rise has been to
bring into use a great quantity of obsolete and disused
metal collected in the fashion of rags and bones for, as is
well known, copper is a comparatively indestructible
metal.

The copper-boom still keeps up. Lake G°orges
went back to 18s., but are now 20s. A div. still expected
in Sept. Girilambone's “A ” and “ B.” shares both ad-
vanced considerably. There is even a rumor that N.
Nymagees have been enquired for at 2d. !! Mt. Lyells
£lO, and there are people who say again they are going to
£l5. Big copper development in the lower tunnel, but a
winze proves a very small part of the lode, and the chances
are that it is being sunk in the best part of it, anyhow.
This mine has been sufficiently developed to know where
to find the best ore. None the less, it is an established
great mine, and people who are satisfied with more than
bank-interest from a solid mining-security, might do worse
than invest even now. Alas! when are the other mines—
Mt. Lyell this, Mt. Lyell that, and Mt. Lyell the other,
going to produce copper ? Chillagoes have been up to 365.
and down to 305., and are standing to-day at 345., which
is equal to an enormous amount of money for the pro-
perty. The little Chillagoes with all sorts of pretentious
names have come into the market at prices which indicate
the madness of the timefe and the folly of the people.
There is practically no business in copper-mining pros-
pectuses, which is something to be thankful for.

Cobar-Chesney (N.S.W.) copper-mine is about
to issue £12,000 worth of debentures bearing 6 per cent,
interest with right of redemption in shares. Object, to
obviate calls and to expedite completion of concentrating,
rock-drilling, and furnace plant now in progress. Mining
manager reports the mine as now able to turn out 200
tons of ore daily, which production can be doubled within
a short time of starting. Officially stated that every sec-
tion of the lode and every level below the copper zone has
been sampled by bulk assays numbering 221, which give
an average of 4T3 per cent, copper, representing a great
width of lode matter and over £3 per ton of ore at pre-
sent price. Half of this will he profit if the ore can be
mined, concentrated, and smelted at the figure estimated
by several copper authorities. Directors’ fees reduced
from £lOOO to £5OO a year.

Marvellous bow alluring tin-shows are. Capital
subscribed “to develop tin-lodes” has been dropped in
every continent with phenomenal regularity ; and .vet, in
spite of past failures, ah English co. has been formed to
try some Euriowie (far west N.S.W.) claims. So there is
hope for even Mt. Wills, the Gippsland district, as to
which the statement is revived that its lodes would
give fortunes “if only capital were available.” For the
writer’s part, he prefers his chances in a Oup-svveep.
J. Bull’s pertinacity with respect to tin-shows
is no doubt due to the Cornish experience—“ Once a tin-
mine always a tin-mine.”

That highly successful {combination, the Great
Cobar Copper Mining Syndicate, which owes its success
greatly to common-sense and good management, is accu-
mulating a very fine plant. The rock drills have for some
time past been operated by two 16in. compressors ; but,
these having become inadequate, an addition is being
made in the shape of an 18in. Ingersoll Sergeant straight-
line piston inlet machine of the most recent type. Inger-
soll drills and compressors are used exclusively on this
mine, and it must be gratifying to Parke and Lacy Co.,
who are the local agents, to have such an outfit on so
conspicuous a property.

Criticisms of B.H. Junction have at last had
some effect, and a clearance has been made of most of the
old board. Two directors have thrown up their seats, and
two others have had their seats knocked from under them.
The contract with the Dry Creek smelting people was the
last straw. Long ago, when the new-chum directors were
lirinp in a fool’s paradise, and cheerfully disregarding re-
peafed warnings, a big contract was made with the Dry
for f Aggrade sulphides; but suddenly the

subsequent Hoxve-Beaglehole law-case ; and now it has
also burst up the board, leaving Howe victor. R. O.
mker and A. R. Addison join the directorate, which is
thus now a sort of committee of the S.A. Leg. Council,
the number of directors has been reduced to five;

confirmatory ” meeting in Adelaide ; under an arrange-
ment which has now no justification the statutory meet-
ings of the 00. are held in Melb., but nothing done there
is legal unless it is confirmed at a subsequent meeting in
Adelaide, where most of the Australian shares are now
held. Next some changes will probably be seen at the
mine.

Broken Hill miners are, on the whole, well
satisfied with the results of the recent conference with
local mine managers on the Sunday labor question—the
first meeting between the parties for seven years. While
undertaking to minimise Sunday work, it was contended
by the managers that its extent hitherto had been
magnified. Mr. Courtney, manager of the Central, the
Sulphide Corporation’s mine, stated that on that property
® n ly just over 2 per cent, of the work was performed on
Sundays, and most of that, the books showed, was in
connection with machinery repairs. By the way, as the
mill itself is not worked on Sunday, the fact that in that
particular department 4'17 per cent, of the total work is
done on the Day of Rust shows how serious an item
wear and tear there is, and therefore how necessary it is
for companies to make liberal depreciation allowances in
their half-yearly accounts

Chaffer’s is a good-position little mine at Kal-

of great value, though opened down to 500 ft. Recently
struck a small seam of telluridein bottom level, and shares
hounded from 10s. to 40s. There are only 350,000 shares,
and 3 is. advance means £525,000! When it leaked out
that the vein was but a few' inches thick, and not
wonderfully rich at that, scrip came back to 255. with a
run, and, but for the number “specked,” probably would
have backed below 1 1. Of course there are rumors of
another development as the level is extended, and there
should he another formation ahead judging from w'hat

Excepting Leonora and Westralian Mt. Morgan,
the country north of Kalgoorlie is dead. Great rush to
former owing to alluvial discovery two miles north of
town, but from reported returns it would appear that the
value of the wash had been over-rated. However, the
prospectors (Kanowna men) are very confident. Paddy
Hannan, who has been reefing there for the past year for
poor results, has a fairly-placed claim. Country pegged

Mephan Ferguson, engineer, boiler-maker, etc.,

nuts and washers w-hich may be required by the Victorian
railways during the next three years. He has also con-
tracted to supply all the carbonic acid gas necessary for
working the railway refrigerating and ice-making plant—
this is one of I. and E. Hall’s patent carbonic anhydride-
machines, the same system as has been adopted by the
Govts, of South Australia, Queensland, and Western Aus-
tralia. Mr. Ferguson has a large stock of these machines
(suitable for meat-preserving co.’s, dairies, butchers, and
others) on hand at present, which he is selling at greatly-

The Westralian Mfc. Morgan is exciting much
attention locally. Located about eight miles N.W. from
now-deserted Margaret township. A. E. Morgan, M.P.
(Coolgardie) got hold of it 18 months ago for a trifle, put
on a little Tremagne mill, paid for mine on development
out of rich returns, and is doing well. Country east of
Margaret, known variously as Earlston, British Flag or
Laverton, not booming, though Dr. Laver, the cricketer’s
brother, is very sanguine, and is said to be supported in
his opinion by Maryanski.

The fact that only a couple of dozen men
appeared at ’Gov. Brassey’s Queen’s Birthday
levee in evening-dress recalls the first levee ever
held in Adelaide. On that occasion (so goes the
story), there was but one dress-coat in the embryo
city, and, as soon as each loyalty-exhibiting sub-
ject had shaken hands with H. Ex., he promptly
retired behind an adjacent tree and handed Over
the garment to another. It was on the night of
another early-day Adelaide levee that a constable
observed an inebriated but well-dressed man
groping along Govt. House wall, and apparently
trying to find the gate. Promptly the cop. pounced
on his quarry and marched him off—heedless of
his maudlin protests—to the station. “ Why, you
blundering idiot ! ” howled the horrified superin-
tendent, “do vou know what you’ve done ?
You’ve run-in His Excellency the Governor ! ”

“ Melb.” ; Never saw Gov. Brassey on the
Grecian unb -nd till one night this week, at a sup-
per given by Lady Bracy—as he still calls her—in
the Sailors’ Home. Well, he does “ perform.”
Diamonds and pearls of copy from his noble lips
on this occasion: “Lady Bracy—er— has given
me a most solemn warning as to what I’m to say
to-night. Oh, I have to be careful—er—Ha !ha !
I love her, you know, but—Ha !ha 1 I’m a bit

“ And what shall we doto get Grace?"
"Er-please sir, put Jones on at one end and
Bill ’Oivell at the other.”
afraid of her ! ” All this delivered in chuckles,
with an unction worthy of Sir Peter Teazle. And
blushy Lady Brassey looking on. When speaking
in a jocular vein, to seamen, His Ex. keeps sway-
ing and s wagging about from side to side, dancing
on alternate feet, as if just about to launch off
upon a quadrille. But his well-meant talk is far
too low-down, as Nelson might condescend to the
igno rant Jacks of his days.

Gov.' Tennyson has to pay his staff and
other expenses out of hi s salary of £4OOO, and has,
therefore, continued the practice set by Gov.
Buxton, of having Govt. House decorated by
Botanic Garden officials free of cost. Local
florists are up in arms, and there are threats of an
appeal to Parliament. In this matter, public
sympathy must, or should, go with the Governor.
The State pays him, say, £ll a day—and what
can you expect for that ?
* * * *
Gov. Tennyson and his pleasant-mannered
wife have made themselves popular in Adelaide
by refraining from “ side.” Gov. Buxton put his
consort on a pedestal, and insisted on her being
addressed as “Your Excellenoy,” as befitting the
daughter of a duke, but Tennyson refers publicly
to Lady Tennyson as “ my wife.”

This really happened last week in Tas-
mania -A wedding was announced in a rural
district; the wedding-feast prepared, the local
schoolhouse decorated, and the parson sent for.
An hour before the ceremony was to come off the
building was crowded with friends of the intend-
ing couple, when who should walk up the aisle
but a girl whom the young man had previously
courted, accompanied by her father and several
stalwart brothers, as “objectors ” to. the marriage.
The “ objection ” didn’t come off, though, for the
bridegroom got wind of the trouble somehow at
the church gate ; the parson had not yet left a
neighboring settler’s house, and the rest was easy.
The congregation waited for an hour, and, as the
bridegroom’s mother and several members of the
bride’s family dropped in at half-time, the disap-
pointed lady and her indignant male supporters
hadn’t the least suspicion of treachery until the
parson arrived to smilingly inform the assemblage
that the ceremony had been “ satisfactorily com-
pleted up at brother Smith’s place.”

They say that a new and well-defined track
has been opened up through the country between
Peak Hill and Menzies by His Ex. Jerry Smith,
Darlington Simpson and party. The track is
clearly defined by empty champagne bottles at
short intervals, half-day stages being marked by
piles of empty pdte de foie gras, asparagus, and
other tins. As the vice-regal procession entered
Leonora it presented the appearance of a large
circus. An Afghan came in advance mounted on
a camel, followed by the Governor and his imme-
diate party in a five-horse drag, and a number of
other traps and vehicles for the conveyance of lug-
gage, amongst the latter being almost every imagi-
nable luxury of civilisation. Altogether, the party
comprised 23 individuals, provided with a similar
number of horses.
Governor Jerrysinith has been at it again. The
Broad Arrow people got up a banquet and sent
forth the Mayor and warden, councillors and mine-
managers, who asked him to come and have a
snack. But Jerry curtly told the crowd that he’d
got his own tucker. So the Broad Arrow people
have got a nasty bruise on their “ Loyalty to the
Throne,” and propose establishing a republic or
an Anarchist club.

J ust after a big church bazaar had closed
its week’s dealings in Wellington, M.L., a local
journal, in a moral spasm, disclosed the fact that
part of the attractions at the holy fair consisted of
a roaring gambling-game and a peep-show of
immoral French pictures. And now the editor is
pestered with letters asking why he didn’t “ give
the show away ”in time—to allow of the promoters
being prosecuted ?—oh, no; to allow all the
church folks to go and judge for themselves as to
the morality of the affair ! A leading light of the
bazaar even wrote to say that, if the denunciation
had only been made a few days earlier, “the
cause ” would have profited by an extra .£lOO.
The unkindest cut of all came when the peep-show
pictures were shown at a street corner and the
police had the owner fined for exhibiting indecent
prints. All which shows—well, it shows. What’s
more, it keeps on showing.

Commenting upon the Itakaia butchery,
J. Ronayne, general manager M.L. Railways, is
reported to have said :
The erection of signals would be no protection what-
ever in such a case, and the rules and regulations pro-
vided are quite sufficient if carried out. He did not
think that a semaphore light could be seen any better
than a hand signal. Semaphore signals were not abso-
lutely necessary.
Which, if he really said it, merely proves that
General Manager Ronayne is excited enough to
say anything to prevent a charge of criminal
neglect being flung in his direction. If Ronayne,
G.M., were not practically on his trial as much as
Driver Carter, his statement would be a first-class
recommendation for Seacliff asylum, but, under
existing circumstances, it is merely the frantic
“ I never-did-it ” yell of the bad boy caught in
the act. To be consistent, Mr. Ronayne ought to
abolish the expensive Winter-Preece interlocking
signals in use at the big terminal stations.

Another good man’s work has gone wrong.
When standard time was introduced to N.S.W.,
Broken Hill being so close to
S.A. border, and being con-
nected only with Adelaide
by rail, naturally kept S.A.
time, which is an hour behind
that of Sydney and Mel-
bourne, wherefore Barrier
pubs, had for a little while to
close when by local reckon-
ing it was only 10 o’clock.
This outrage on Barrier
thirst was so pressed on
Cann, M.P., that, though a
strong temperance apostle,
he introduced and carried a
bill to allow local pubs, to
observe the mean time of the
135th meridian, which was then
S.A. standard time. Now, how-
ever, that time is no longer ob-
served ; S.A. clocks have been put
on half-an-hour, and Broken Hill
clocks have followed. If Cann’s Act
had said that Barrier pubs, should
observe S.A. standard time, things
would have been all right; but it
didn’t —with the result that in
Broken Hill, alone in all Aus-
tralia, the pubs, now keep open
till 11.30 sounds. And as the
W.C.T.TJ. contemplates this
awful thing it has to say no-
thing ; for it is all a cold-
teaman’s doing.

For the past decade
the birth-rate in England
and Wales has been steadily
decreasing, having fallen al-
most every year since 1880.
Fewer children were born last year
in proportion to pbpulation than in
any other year. There were actually 50,000 more
births registered in 1847 than last year. England
runs France a good second in the declining-birth-
rate business.

Somebody’s omission to send a title to Jus-

although he returned from his holiday at the

variously gossiped about. According to one yarn,
he has earned for himself in England the reputa-
tion of being an advanced Radical—a regular
roarer and tearer. The main support of this
calumnious estimate has been traced to his mount-
ing the bench without wig or gown one hot day a
couple of years ago.
An essay on
Sydney men and
Maoriland men, by
a M.L. woman in
Sydney
Have been to several
Federation meetings in
Sydney, where the gal-
leries reserved for
women were promptly
jumped by men, ar.d
where the women sat
on the steps and on a
stray masculine boot,
and were thankful;
have likewise been to
crowded political meet-
ings in Maoriland,
where a gentle smile
ousted 16st. of male
politeness from chairs
to which the smilers
had not the smallest
claim ; and I have not
come to the conclusion
that the man Sydneyite
is a hog and the M.L.
ditto an archangel, be-
cause various other
things have to be taken
into account. The Syd-
neyite is only a hog en
masse ; the virtuous
Maorilander is seldom
a gentleman indi-
vidually. He is good
to the sex all round,
but his own particular
donah has generally a
sober time of it. When
a Dunedin man gets
engaged he alivays
breaks it off before
Christmas so that he
will not need to give
her a present. He
takes her on again in
January, so it is all
right. Also, when he
invites her to go to the
theatre with him (a
shilling art-gallery is
more in his line) he
arranges to meet her
inside the door. As a
rule, he doesn’t give
her any presents, be-
cause she is too pure
and good, and ithuits
him to place her on a
level with the Flossies
and Cissies. It gene-
rally takes a M.L. girl
ten years to find out
that it doesn’t pav to
be pure and good, but
once she does find it out, she never loses that valuable
discovery. But the Maorilander makes the decerder hus-
band, which is quite in keeping. The Sydneyite beiiw
more altruistic, naturally does not show well in the mat-
rimonial line; the wife is the other self, and it is selfish to
be good to one’s self. He prefers being good to another
man s self. It is well to be married to a Maorilander ; it
is better to be unmarried to a Sydneyite.

Some miserable snuffler writes to a Sydney
sectarian “paper ” to complain that in one of the
suburban parks the noise of the children playing
interferes with the listeners to certain Sum
day - afternoon open - air preachments and
prayings by “ the brethren.” And an-
other alleged Christian has been yelp-
ing over the horrible spectacle of over
1000 girls going down the harbor on
Sunday. “These bones shall rise
again!” is a line of a nigger revival-
song j and they have indeed risen—the
bones, to wit, of Calvin, John Knox &
co., who, having died miserable as they
lived, can’t even remain satisfactorily
dead, but must rise up to demand the
Sunday muzzling of innocent children
and the denial of a little Sunday recrea-
tion to the girl slaves of sanctified
Mammon.

“ The Hobart (Tas.) authorities, in answer
to indignant remarks in the North re the sentence
passed upon Ward and Williams for escaping
from gaol, have excused themselves by asserting
that the irons placed on the prisoners are so light

by them. Which recalls the little boy’s answer to
the parson when the latter told him the Devil’s
chain was long enough to reach round the world :
“ Why, the beggar might as well be loose ! ”

“ Might you be called an old maid 1 ” asked
paternal Justice G. B. Simpson in Sydney Divorce
Court, adding, “I find no legal decision bearing
on such a point.” There exists a decision of the
French Courts, if that is any guide. A benevolent
died there years ago, bequeathing his fortune to
establish an Old Maids’ Home. When the home
was opened, necessitous unmarried women of all
ages claimed admission, and the trustees were
driven to the Court for a rule defining at what age
a woman became an old maid. The Court fixed
30 years, and the managers of the home expelled
a number of inmates, some of whom were but a
few weeks under that figure. To call a single
woman of 40 an old maid has been held in Sydney
to be insulting language.

G. B. Simpson’s pliancy to women’s letters sent to

will physically fail to master their contents, and
the other, that Judges in general jurisdictions,
when similarly pestered, will be morally unable to
commit for contempt, as they will not like to treat
as a legal offence a familiarity one Judge encour-
ages as an aid to justice.

The Melbourne Castles boom aptly illus-
trates Buskin’s remark on newspaper criticism (in
“Modern Painters”): —“A writer for a news-
paper naturally and necessarily endeavors to meet,
as nearly as he can, the feelings of a majority of
his readers, his bread depends upon his doing so.”
In the beginning the Age critic, foreseeing a
boom, shrewdly barracked for Amy Castles for all
his pen was worth. The Argus critic (a man of
dull wits but solid judgment) did not enthuse a
ha’porth. But when the boom grew, the Argus
turned on its descriptive writers and tried all it
knew to churn out more butter of Castles brand
than its rival down street. It finally triumphed
when at the ballooned Amy’s Exhibition concert
it turned out a column and a half of leaded
descriptive gush—leaving its regular critic to bite
his finger-nails—while the Age critic only dribbled
a half-column.

The Bulletin rejoices to see that the
Melb. press has severely left alone the firebrand
who lately came along with a view to declaring
cash dividends for himself out of the miserable
old orange-and-green feud. He was announced to
hold forth the other Sunday morning at Bruns-
wick, a suburb notorious as the scene of religious
riot, and the respective pups of the local factions
turned out to snarl at one another. The Pope-
basher had a big audience, every man attached to
an umbrella or a stick, and around the church
hovered yellow and green hankering for fight.
But the police of two suburbs were also about—
fine, big men, with batons up their sleeves and
handcuffs ready ; also an inspector from Russell-
street was on hand with a special reserve. So
there--was no riot after all. Next evening the
orator declared that the Melb. press, which refuses
to promote a fight, is “under the thumb of
Rome.”

The recent death of Agnes O’Neill at

in a mean back street. She was aged 27, and had

marriage. They camped in a three-roomed cot-
tage behind a brewery, six of them in a bed —

in U.K., and rarely occurring in U.S.) has been
discovered in a Sydney suburb by Dr. Spencer.
The complaint, marked by a strange reptilian
shedding of the skin, was particularly rife in a
lying-in hospital, but has now been stamped out.

“ Wurrym” to The Bulletin :
Since the Early-Closing Act came into force in
W.A., the inspectors—in Perth, anyhow—have been
kept busy prosecuting shopkeepers for breaches of
the Act. Each case has been defended and fought out
on quibbles such as “ Are walking-sticks a legitimate
portion of a tobacconist’s stock?” “ What is the differ-
eace between a seedsman and a nurseryman?” and so
on. There is much talk of introducing an amending Act
during the coming session, and, under the cloak of get-
ting Parliament to define certain arguable points, an
ait/empt will be made to emasculate the present Act,
wl ich “interferes too greatly with the liberty of the sub-
ject.” As an example : It is sought to get rid of what is
called an incongruity, and which, on the face of it, seems
such. A tobacconist and fancy-goods dealer may sell
tobacco, cigars, matches, walking-sticks, up till 10 p.m.,
but accordeons, razors, &c., no later than 6 p.m. A
stationer may sell note-paper till 10 p.m., but not a toy
after 6 p.m. A nurseryman may sell cut flowers till the
later hour, but seeds are “ off” after 6 p.m. Hence shops
are to be seen in various parts of the city where, at 6 p.m.,
the forbidden goods arefenced off by partitions. The latest
prosecution under the- Act was directed against a hair-
dresser for neglecting to give one of his employes a half-
holiday during the week. The defence was that the
could have had the half-holiday if he liked, but
would have lost ss. “ payment for overtime ” had he
taken it. Then it transpired that before the Act came
into force defendant paid salaries of £3 a week to his
barbers—current rates then, it was stated, being £2 10s.
The enforcement of the E.O. Act resulted in his reducing
his rate to the current level, and offering ss. as payment
for overtime to those employes who were prepared to fore-
go their weekly half-holiday. “ Preferably I would em-
ploy men who would take payment for overtime,’’ said de-
fendant. “Preferably we would take the half-holidays for
the sake of a rest,” said the employes. And then a com-
mon-sensible section of the Act came along and said :
“No employer shall permit any to remain upon
his premises upon such half-holiday as shall be allotted
to him ” —so that defendant’s action was, unknowingly on
his part, I believe, an attempt to induce his employes to
contract themselves out of the Act. That clause suits
the employes, for whose benefit the Act was passed, right
down to the ground, for it prevents an employer offering
his employes the choice of foregoing their half-holidays
or their billets. And this clause is one that is to be
attacked in Parliament, because, if you please, “ it in-
terferes with the liberty of the (shop-keeping) subject.”

“ Frank ” to The Bulletin :
At a magisterial inquiry into the demise of Lizzie Beck-
more at Somerton, N.S.W., it transpired that deceased, a
single woman of about 36 years, of good character locally,
had for four years previous to death been general servant
to a Chinaman’s wife. The Chow’s slavey received no
wages, but worked for clothes and board and lodging.
This unfortunate Caucasian drudge about six years ago
left Sydnpy Female Refuge after a term of three years’
residence in that delectahle reformatory. From the
foregoing facts, elicited and attested before a P.M., it is
apparent that weak-minded and unfortunate women may
be enslaved by alien pagans in Australia, and sweated
after the manners and customs of Asiatics. Also, it
seems that charity, long-suffering indeed, is doomed to
suffer some more ; since this hideous instance of virtue
being its own reward illustrates the progress of the peni-
or merely unfortunate, from the Female Refuge to
the pauper’s grave of the destitute white slave of the
slant-eyed Chinkie colonist. Vote for Federation ? Yes,
by thunder ! No other alternative save violent revolt
from existing conditions.

In a certain vice-regal household long ago
a vice-regal baby was daily expected. Owing to
an undue amount of premonitory maternal ner-
vousness and excitement the doctor was sent for
some half-dozen times before he was really wanted,
much to his annoyance. The baby arrived duly—
a beauty. Doctor’s bill also arrived duly—also a
beauty ; £5O. Papa stormed at the amount and
protested. “Very well,” said the medico, “I will
accept nothing. His Excellency can have his
child gratis.” And gratis he has it.

“A tidal wave of gambling,” writes The
Bulletin’s London correspondent, “ has just
surged over the West of this patchwork city.
Now, the ebb has fairly set in, and while many
have been carried out into the ocean of luxury, not
a few have sunk in the quicksands and others lie
crippled, stranded high and dry. The feminine
fashionables turned ‘ copper ’ into gold while the
boom lasted, and ‘bridge’ whist has been speci-
ally introduced to relieve their financial plethora.
But the dough-headed males have lost theirs or
else’s in very Eiffel-Tower play at the
clubs. The refrigerating and extra-exclusive
‘ Bachelors’ Club ’ has budded such disasters of
recent that the Cape Mounted Police has had a
rush of recruits, and Melb. and Sydney may
expect some choice assortments of ‘ haw-haw’s ’
with centipedal allotments of boots, innumerable
draughty checks, and green shirts, instanter. One
young ‘ Bachelor ’ lost .£15,000 with the devil’s
text-cards in an early - morning sitting. He
migrated hurriedly, forgetting at least 11 pairs of
boots. It only costs 50 guineas entrance and 10
guineas per annum to join this club, and nothing
to leave—which is cheaper.”
NOT GOOD ENOUGH.
"Now, my young man, throw away that cigar!”
“Gam! So as you can pick it up! If yer asked
fer me butt I’d give it to yer, but when yer
comes that game I’m not havin’ any.
John Joseph Lovekin, candidate for the
billet of alderman in Brisbane, struck the free and
flabbergasted elector in the eye last month with
this address: —
EAST WARD CONTEST.
Ladies and Gentlemen—
As it is within the powers given to every one of us to
make free use of our natural gifts, so it is wise to recruit
our health, build up our strength so as to be able to
husband our means, so as to live the length of our days
with that independence of spirit and goodwill unto all
men as a preparation for parting the one from the other,
even as clever aldermen in somebod3'’s interests have to
do, though it may take many days to heal the wounds
opened out by the parting of bosom friends.
To-day I enjoyed the Lytton encampment very much,
and observed the movements of the Queen’s representa-
tive, Lord Lamington, Colonel Eicardo, Major Lyster.
I took much interest in the great “ review ” at Weedon
Central Barracks in 1855, when the invalided troops from
India were being prepared for service in the Crimea. I
was one of the Fire Brigade of the noted ex-troopship
Columbia, carrying Her Majesty’s mails between Sydney,
Melbourne, Port Adelaide, King George’s Sound, Point de
Galle, Aden, and Suez.
Captain Pender, a Scottish widow’s brave son, swore by
me ; the Admiralty agent, whom no man could sway, was
reciprocal with me ; the purser, Mr. Alger, kept me by
the ship on high pay while we lay at Water view Bay
fitting. I could go where I liked for pleasure, and, when
she was ready to sail, Mr. Alger advised me to stay behind
and do better, their company going under changes.
I could get some things done well there, the officers,
engineers, crew, firemen, stewards, Lascars, and “ all
casts ” respected me, and we all parted good friends.
I had 14s. per day by I attained ray majority, under
Cornish and Bruce, on the Ballarat line—where I first
saw young Tom M’llwraith, whom I never disclosed that
fact to.
I knew Captain Rountree, who offered the chance of
30s. per day, only I was sick. He gave my brother Bill a
job, and he earned 30s. per day for about six months
under Foreman Thomson, and our own Bob Laing was a
young man there then.
If you need an address I will speak ; but your time can
be as well employed, and I may be resting.
There will be some of the very best cabs for your com-
fort, with well-trained and steady drivers. You will
know them by the Red, White, and Blue ribbons.
There is nothing like thorough discipline, it opens the
door to promotion by merit, which should be open to
every man, and is open now if he knocks.
Poll early on Ist June.
I am, yours faithfully,
J. J. LOVEKIN.

it l r n«t a ?, a ery ,! t was ! All the dressmakers
m Sydney—the gallery is a godsend to dress-
makers seeking styles-old women, young women
children, infants, even young men. Society people
n mourning also escape to the galleries now. If
n n Ot J, ler way of knowing them, you can
tea them by their withering comments on all the
pretty frocks beneath. In all that crowd of well-
dressed women there is not one who looks well •
not one—to the Society people in the gallery. ’
Some people make a point of going down to sup-
per on the Vice-regal heels. Others do better.
Ihey watch the exodus from the sacred dais, and
when the party disappears round the corner, step
upeasually, and sink into the velvet chairs for a
Jittle brief authority. A pallid legal light of 70
years sliming was the first to do this on Wednes-
day. He had his reward. Two washerwomen
mistook him for the Governor. They came on to
the opposite gallery and looked down. They had
been in the other gallery all the evening waiting
for a clearance to get round to this point of van-
tage. Ihey looked at the poor old legal light for

Slowly and sadly the word went round that

bops, half a bar before the music.
Such superior frocking hasn’t been seen in
Sydney for a very long time; nor such high hair-
dressing. But where was the Society woman
whose frocks are so far ahead of everyone else’s ?
■that question has been asked at all the balls this
season, and has lately attempted to foolishly
answer itself by saying that nobody has intro-
duced this star to the Governor, so she keeps
aloof. Lady Mary Lygon was dressed in a more
considered way than at her first ball. She wore a
lovely opal-tinted brocade polonaise, opening
over flounces of mauve chiffon. Her close!
tight way of doing her hair and her superb
diamonds remind people of Lady Carington.
is, the most satisfactory dress in the room
was Mrs Rennie’s geranium-pink satin, quite a
triumph of color. Flounces of real lace, in front of
the skirt only, allowed the back to flow in long
straight lines (which cannot be improved on, after
all), and the bodice followed the smart, skimpy
little way of the moment, with no sleeves, and
tin> revers. Miss Sylvia Harley wore a white-'
satin apron over chiffon flounces and a bodice of
striped heliotrope and white. Mrs. John See, in
white brocade, took the Gov. down to supper. Mrs.
Hogue made a respectful contrast in heliotrope”
Miss Lee, daughter of the Minister for Justice
made her debut in a pretty, girlish frock of white
satin. Mrs. Lee was stately in canary brocade and
median lace. A little lady in white satin, with a
meandering profile and complicated top dressing
sported Jashion’s latest fad, a tiny artificial
bouquet that opened out into a fan. Mrs. Ernest
YVilshire wore her wedding-dress of trailing ivory
satin, and big white bouquet. Miss Maud Gow-
land was in white with wreathings of scarlet.
At the Jewish ball, Paddington Town Hall, last
ihursday, the sons and daughters of Israel had
themselves summoned into supper, beyond all mis-
take, by a bell. It has happened that an Isaac
has gone in late to supper and been told that the
lobster salad is “off.” So a man was sent on to
the platform after a certain dance to ring a bell
and cry “supper” in a low voice, and in one
minute there was not a soul left in the ballroom.
n "o' , beaufciftd gown was Mrs. Bernard
Lohens large - patterned silver sequin -net over
white satin, touched up with rearing feathers of
mandarin-yellow on one shoulder. Pretty Miss
Mitchell, a Queensland debutante, wore white
satin under a spangled apron, and net flounces,
f n G?T y ndxed several shades of pink success-
fully. Then there were dressers who put on every-
thing a chain, a string of pearls, a piece of ribbon,
and a paste-necklet, all round some necks to-
gether.
_B° Mayor Harris has got what he deserves.
What . Oh, well, you know what 1 mean. Cor-
porations, dust-boxes, municipalities—have all
ended m knighthood. Sir Matthew and Lady
Harris, Greeting.
By the way, they say that the first few days of
being a Lady are full of. pitfalls. I believe that
the apologetic blushes of the bride who has to be
asked three times over before she knows she is the
Pemm spoken to are nothing to the trepidations of
the Mrs. who can never answer to that name
again. For a week she feels as if the world is
making game of her. She can only hope it will
stop soon. She thinks it very unkind and very
horrid to persist, and not a bit funny. Her sub-
consciousness won’t corroborate. She was Mr*.
Dash yesterday. She can’t be Lady Dash to-day.
b ].l la , H re , at the papers, heard it, and then
suddenly the film vanishes. Mrs. Dash, indeed !
Common, ordinary, far-away, almost-forgotten
person. You are dead, buried— -never were, for
tne matter of that. For she knew from her child-
hood she would be my Lady someday, and there
is nothing strange in this.
Ihe latest Society craze has bitten Sydney
badly. Last week there were three Novel Parties
m one suburb. At one of these Mrs. Dibbs went
as “She” (Gr. Dibbs was unable to go as He
because there is no He). You dress up as a Novel,
you know, and if nobody can guess who you are,
you reveal your identity. Our Salon gives its
upst entertainment on these lines to-morrow
(Wednesday), when the flow of soul is expected to
immortalise many masterpieces. As some sort of
connection aesthetic or purely intellectual—is
looked for between the novel and its representa-
“iY. e > I feel safe in recommending “The Wide
Wide World” to George Reid ; “ The Silence of
Oean Maitland” to any bore at all ; “Comedies
• lp ’” to aP . hungry-eyed maids over (JO ;
Ihe Science of Fried Fish,” to all whose noses
get in the way of their eyes : and “Beauchamp’s
Career, ’ to any woman aged from 10 to a hundred.
Some pleasing fixtures are the Sydney Univer-
sity ball, Paddington Town Hall, June 29th, to
be attended by the Governor and suite ; Madame
Lottie Harkness’ dramatic recital, the Centenary
Hall, June 21st; Miss Celia Dampier’s benefit
concert, at the Oddfellows’ Temple, Friday, June
23rd.
It is said that the Governor was in the habit of
holding Sunday-school in England every Sabbath
afternoon. His Ex. now finds the afternoon at
the beginning of the week hang so heavily on his
hands that he proposes (so goes the story) to con-
tinue in his exemplary course and hold a weekly
Sunday-school at St. James’s, Sydney. The girls
of the neighborhood are anxious to know if they
are to be taught as well as the boys. If so, the
new teacher will find such a stream of young
people in long hair and short frocks, aged anything
from 10 to 20, as will soon cure him of Sabbath-
school proclivities.
At the Lyceum theatre, what a sea of tears is
shed every night over “A Soldier and a Man.”
On Saturday, in spite of the outer wet, half the
house seemed bent on moistening the inner atmo-
sphere with salt and water. I saw one man with
a long beard crying openly into his handkerchief.
Up m the gods, where they don’t have handker-
chiefs, the thing is to collapse into the bend of
your arm and sniff there, unseen, but audible. I
noticed that the male gods found this piece just
as pathetic as the lady gods. Who says that
larrikins have no hearts? Go and watch all the
coatless youths that can’t get seats, and stand up
manfully and weep unabashed, with their heads
held up when they can’t find room to get to their
ariris.
Still, there were a few stony people who never
cried once, not even when Alice Deorwyn falls dead
of- heart-disease in a light cane chair, because the
mignonette in the old home has been covered with
Philistine brick-dust. Not even when Frank
Hawthorne sells his coat for steak and onions.
Not even when Robert Inman, with a hollow in
his cheek, confesses his guilt, and dies with his
eyes wide open. Not even when John Saunders
is I'd out to be shot, and kneels to say a prayer.
Not even—but I might go on like this for ever, as
far as the public is concerned, as there is scarcely
one dry spot in the play, except - the powder.
The new lady, Miss Dora de Winton, revels in
the skimpiest frocks I ever saw a heroine wear.
“Long and clinging ” is all very well. Miss de
Win ton’s first pmk-and-white muslin is about a
yard and an eighth wide in the skirt, and gives no
indication whatever of a petticoat underneath.
Also, she wears her hair in a long black pigtail,
with a knob at the back of the head. Even when
she marries a drunkard, and has to take work
with a broken heart, the pigtail continues. But
somehow, one cannot reconcile a pigtail with great
misery. Melodrama has always insisted that a
loose knot at the back of the head should mark all
sorrowful heroines for its own, and Miss de Win-
ton’s innovation is not a success. Otherwise, the
new star is pretty in a bizarre way. Some people
see a resemblance to Bernhardt in the narrow eves,
graceful movements, and not too frequent smile!
Mr. John D. Saunders is built on the latest Lon-
don lines, with a profile and the smartest boots
and suits the Lyceum has seen since its melodrama-
days began.
Ada Crossley is under hot discussion in a Syd-
ney weekly. Seven columns have just spread
themselves over the story of Ada’s tiff with Melba,
her desertion of Santley for Marchesi, and the
comparative failure of her first concert. Con-
sidering that the Australian contralto has fought
her way up to the second place in the list of Eng-
land’s deep-voiced songstresses, the resuscitation
of these past mistakes makes one wonder. Every-
one who has foliovved her career knows that she
struck against a snag soon after she reached Lon-
don. For the matter of that, who doesn’t strike a
snag, big or little, possible or impossible, at the
beginning of a career ? The road to fame has
always been lined with snags, so that candidates
will imagine they are always getting up in the
world. And Ada's snag seems to have been the
lordly advice of Melba. “You must come with
me at once—to-morrow morning, to Paris and
Marchesi.” There was no question of con-
venience, of funds; and Ada, whose business
head has never deserted her, may have
faltered at the idea of such a sudden
inroad on her bank-book. Anyway, next morning
Melba went alone. She was angry with Crossley
for disobeying, and coolness existed for some time.
Later on, Crossley did go to Marchesi, had her
voice turned upside-down, learned she was no con-
tralto at all, but a pure soprano, and finally
returned in sorrow to the forgiving Santley whose
pupil she owned herself at her first concert.
Many Australiennes will be perturbed to hear
that their bosom friend— cn passant, of course—Dr.
Mrs. Longshore Potts, has dropped £175 for her
unskilful treatment of a young lady in Manchester.
“Gone to Pot,” suggests itself as an epitaph.
Mrs. A. L. P. “dollied” the dollars most suc-
cessfully out of her “ southern sisters, ” for when
the distrustful sex once takes in the doctress she
takes her thick and often.
Excessive tennis-playing should be discouraged
amongst young women, if all reports speak true,
llie premature death of a Sydney solicitor’s hand-
some young wife was ascribed incidentally to this
cause ; the health of a famous ex-champion has
been seriously impaired by the same means ; while
the present champion is said to have been most
alarmingly exhausted after a recent afternoon’s
play.
Writes my Melbourne correspondent:—
“Lord Brassey, weary at last of falling off, has
taken tiredly to falling in, the scene of his latest
and most successful effort being Albert Park
Lagoon.
“ihe quite unexpected and unduly previous
announcement that two grand balls will be
given by his Ex. in honor of the Winter Season,
or something, looks very like a sop to the Philis-
tines. There had been no whisper of such reck-
less extravagance. The news came like a thunder-
clap amidst a storm of after-comments on the
latest effort in vice - regal entertainment. A
society for staying away from Court Concerts
was about to be formed when the rebel-
hous spirits got word of these promised hops.
Homebody must have told the Queen’s representa-
tive that his one-and-ninepenny style of celebrat-
ing the Sovereign’s birthday called for a practical
apology, or perhaps he gleaned as much from the
inarticulate snorts of his honored guests a fort-
night ago. Whatever the cause, the fact retnair.3
that Uncle Tom has gone dancing mad. One
wouldn t be surprised to find him doing things
next time on a scale of hitherto unattempted
splendor under the management of Bland Holt.
Ihe eccentricity of wealth is apt to run to ex-
tremes.
“ People are surmising that a certain decollete
member of the Guvment House set has been
desired by Lady Brassey to keep her high-toned
sense of humor ’ under decent control. At the
meagre Birthday festival this imported scoffer
was observed to find much less pleasure than
usual in calling attention to ‘ awful sights ' among
the crowd, many of whom were permitted to pass
inoffensively by without being once ridiculed. If
Lady B. gave her snobbish friend the hint it was
just as well she didn’t hold it back any longer, for
the worms were getting ready to turn on their gay
and festive critic. From stern Respectability’s
point of view, no sight is more awfid than a
woman in a. Brown-Pottery bodice. So there
now!
“An audience of the rolled up
to hear Marshall - Mali’s first lecture on ‘The
Essential in Art.’ Half the audience were women
—mostly musical women : hair drooping over the
forehead in Rossetti-like, Beata-Beatrix droops,
soulful eyes, and all that sort of thing. M.-H. was
not dreadfully shocking, but he said a few very
good things. His hit-back at his clerical critics,
and his cJairn for tne production of works of art
‘ unbowdlerised by the well-advertised virtuous-
ness of Mrs. Grundys in breeches,’ brought a
laugh. And when he spoke of flabby art as
lacking guts, ’ there was a perceptible shudder,
until he hastened to add ‘to quote Milton’s
powerful simile, ’ and then it sounded quite pro-
per; for what pious Milton said must be O.K.
When he declared his belief that all true virtue is
as strong as nature, and as durable,’ he drew up
Ins six-foot-odd to its full height, as much as to
say— ‘ like my virtue, for instance.’ And the Con-
servatorium girls in the front row sniggered.
. “As a lecturer, Marshall-Hall wants a lot of
improving. He ought to attend the elocution-
lessons at his own Conservatorium. He stands
awkwardly; he reads clumsily. Frequently he
loses his place in his MS. ; again, he skips half-a-
page and has to go back with the correction, ‘Oh,
I mustn’t miss this.’ Then, of course, when he
reads the missed bit it falls flat, however smart it
may be. When he expands a poiut extempore, he
wanders, becomes confused, and repeats himself.
Above all, it is absurd to refer to the sublimity of
certain phrases of music without sounding them
on a piano or some other instrument. For all
this, it is refreshing and stimulating to hear
Marshall-Hall.
“ The old, old death-bed story is told of a well-
known identity. He had, unhappily, outlived all
his nearest and dearest, and was left in his last
illness to the care of a quartette party of domestics
and nurses, all four women being enthusiastically
devoted to the only true Church. For some time
admittance was refused to everyone but the
spiritual fathers of the patient. Finally, the next-
of-kin became alarmed, and after much bother and
great exertion he cleared the zealous hirelings off
the premises.
“ The last will and testament of that deceased
ex-political light draws attention once more
to his unconventional domestic arrangements.
Daughters, married and single, handsomely pro-
vided for, no less than ‘ the other woman 1 ’ Just
now a favorite hen-party topio of discussion is,
‘ Would you rather be the penniless child of
properly-churched parents, or have £40,000 and a
marriage-lineless Ma ? ”
Chief Justice Madden took the chair at
Marshall-Hall’s first lecture (there are five more in
prospect !) Gov. Brassey declined to attend
the Conservatorium concert given during the time
the Argus was making its attack on Marshall
Hall; so he will not be asked any more to attend
anything that Marshall Hall has anything to do
with. The C.J., however, is the sort of hearty
man who likes a fellow all the more for having his
little fling; and he consented to take the chair,
readily and at once.
‘ de a lassie siller and all other gifts and graces
will be added unto her.’ Press reports of Melb.
Hunt Club’s first meet this season make special
mention of a local heiress, though fellow-riders of
said seemingly somewhat timid equestrienne
describe her as not such stuff as Dianas are made of.
“ City streets looked deserted the night of Amy
Castles’ first Exhibition crush. Even the Brasseys
and their Suppression-of-cruelty-to-children meet-
ing had the Town Hall more or less to themselves,
despite free musical entertainment, &C. Chief
Secretary Peacock, braying hilariously in the
emptiness, couldn’t get on with his speech
without some simpering reference to himself
as ‘a single man!’ But is there anything
madly. funny in the fact of a non-Benedict
educationally fathering young Victoria ? Surely
the joke loses its freshness in view of genera-
tions of monies and nuns—celibate guardians of
youth, not to speak of bachelor doctors and
teachers, maiden nurses and midwives ! ‘Go to
the ant,’ and you’ll find the pre-destined celibates
of the hillock entrusted with the entire care of
the rising generation.
“At that Children’s Protection meeting, Nick
Fitzgerald, M.L.C., blarneyed floridly about its
having been left to a comparative stranger (Lady
Brassey) to diagnose the canker (cruelty to child-
ren) eating into the vitals of the community.
Gov. 8., apparently not relishing this sizing-up of
his wife as. social scavenger and fossicker for
faults, explained ponderously that his Good Lady
had not spotted the trouble for herself. ‘ Per-
sons ’ employed on the judicial bench had given
her the tip.
“Una Bourne, the newest thing in pianistes,
playing at Scherek’s concert (June 3rd) wore a
girlish brown-velveteen frock with red neck-bow
and knot of same color in her long, fair, waving
hair. What with pale, golden curls, delicate
coloring and small refined features, the name
1 Una ’ suits its clever owner to a T, while
Scherek, leading her to the piano, did pretty well
for ‘ the lion, ’ thanks to his mane. The heart of
the Coy clan seems turning over to its ‘Roberto,’
and on Saturday .Signorina C., in blue coat and
skirt and cerise-trimmed hat, sang of him (Berto)
as heretofore. The Naicest, who always did
approve of Scherek, attended his concert in force.
“ The ways of women were illustrated in all
their mexpiieableness by that double row of
adorers lining the footpath out to the road after
Julius Knight’s matinee performance. One timid
creature, whose enthusiasm was getting chilled to
its backbone, tried to move things on by despe-
rately suggesting that those finely-moulded limbs,
to catch a last glimpse of which they were all
waiting, might not be good, honest flesh-and-blood
after all. Things were not always what they seemed.
Occasionally they were padded. ‘Padded ! ’ ex-
claimed a handsome dowager. 1 Don’t you believe
it, my dear ! I never saw a pair of arms in my
life like that but the legs matched them ! ’
“Fortune’s smiles are proverbially fickle, and
the delightful uncertainty of their duration lends
zest to the enjoyment of the favored few on whom
they are temporarily bestowed. The most recent
victims of her caprice are a handsome couple,
whose courtship was strongly flavored with
romance, and who, some little time back, began
life together at Toorak with a splash, blinding
feminine friends with envy. They have lost afi
their money. An unrevealed Someone is responsible
for the catastrophe. Tears and lamentations are
to be followed up by a sale of goods and effects,
and a withdrawal from society of one of its
most charming members.
“ Talking of profiles, I wouldn’t give a fig for
the woman who didn’t secure a fleeting glimpse of
the Beauchamp sido-face when Baron Brassey
drove the well-featured child-Governor round
Melb. en passant. ‘ And behold it was very good! ’
Lord Shaftesbury seems to have been booming
considerably since he withdrew his title and his
gentle warble from Melbourne sassiety. A few
weeks back he was credited with the capture of a
Murkan millionairess, and now he is definitely
engaged to a daughter of the late Earl Grosvenor,
eldest son of the Duke of Westminster.’ Being
nearly related by blood to the richest landed pro-
prietor in Hingland, the lady should be able to put
a lot of gilt on Shaftesbury’s silvery tenor.

No. 2.—The Postman.
A rural postman writes : “I desire to add this
unsolicited testimony to the sterling qualities of
Dr. Tibbies’ Yi-Cocoa. lam a rural postman,
and exposed to all kinds of weather. I have
used Dr. Tibbies’ Vi-Cocoa daily this last eleven
months, and I believe that I can do my work with
less fatigue since I have used it. I can honestly
recommend to my fellow postman Dr. Tibbies’
Yi-Cocoa for its sustaining qualities.”
Of late years many new manufactures, rejoicing
in a multiplicity of names, have been brought
before the public notice, but there are none which
have bounded into favor so readily as has Dr.
Tibbies’ Vi-Cocoa. Throughout the country its
sales have increased with great rapidity, and an
article which only a few years back was unheard
of has now become one of the most popular
beverages of the people.
Merit, and merit alone, is what is claimed for
Dr. Tibbies’ Vi-Cocoa, and the Proprietors are
prepared to send to any reader who names The
Bulletin (a postcard will do) a dainty sample tin
of Dr. Tibbies’ Vi-Cocoa free and post-paid.
There is no magic in all this. It is a plain,
honest, straightforward offer. It is done to intro-
duce the merits of Vi-Cocoa into every home.
Dr. Tibbies’ Vi-Cocoa, as a concentrated form of
nourishment and vitality, is invaluable; nay,
more than this, for to all who wish to face the
strife and battle of life with greater endurance
and more sustained exertion, it is absolutely in-
dispensible.
Dr. Tibbies’ Vi-Cocoa can be obtained from all

PERSONAL ITEMS.
Matthew Harris, Mayor of Sydney, has
been knighted. He richly deserves it.
Patriarchal James Smith, the doyen of
Melbourne pressmen, has rewarmed his old senti-
ments on Spiritualism, and has lately toured rural
Victoria expounding them.
. The Bulletin respectfully draws attention
to the picture of Gov. Beauchamp published by
Sydney Mail, and thanks Heaven that His Ex-
cellency has to travel on his noble head and not
on his noble legs.
The first chairman of the A.M.P. Society
still lives, in the person of Archibald Michie,
Q.C.; and a policy-holder of the first year, 1849,
who is still a policy-holder, was present at the
jubilee meeting.
Gov. Tennyson has decided to run a small
racing-stable, a decision which will greatly popu-
larise him in the W.C.T.U. city. So far he has
not missed a race-meeting. Gov. Buxton never
missed a mothers’-meeting.
Bulletin readers and personal friends
will regret to hear that, up to April 28, Australian
artist B. E. Minns was still lying in a private
ward at Guy’s hospital, London. He had lost
3st. since being operated on.
Some people are saying that the acquire-
ment of a baronetcy by Judge Way will give him
a mortgage on the Chief-Justiceship of the Com-
monwealth. Such a bauble might impress the
people, but it won’t impress the politicians.
A Melb. auctioneer’s advt., announcing the
sale of pictures, specified one by “the late Sir
Peter Lely.” As Sir Peter has not been seen alive
since 1680 (he was Court-painter to Charles II.), it
was pretty safe to describe him as “ the late ”
Scobie Mackenzie has been making fun of
Digger Dick’s new J’sP. “ They come into court
very regularly,” he said, recently, “but they’re
not always on the bench.” One of them had just
got four months’ hard, for fraudulent bankruptcy.
Captain Baines, a Westralian political
prisoner and one-time resident of Sydney, is re-
ported dead at San Francisco. The Italians im-
prisoned him for being a Papal Brigade man, the
English transported him for being a Fenian, and
Maoriland expelled him for being an ex-convict.
The cabled publication by London Times
of Esterhazy’s confession that he forged the famous
Dreyfus bordereau is a triumph for the paper
named—almost atoning for its defeat over Pigott.
Evidently the Times has a corner in forgers’ con-
fessions.
When Premier Reid was at Lome (Vic.),
last summer, somebody reminded him that Reid
pert had been a North Melb. parson. Instead of
admitting the soft impeachment in a federal
spirit, Premier George grunted, “That was when
I was a boy playing marbles !” and walked away.
But was Reid ever thin enough to get down to a
marble ?
Ben Tillett, turning paid immigration
tout for the Queensland Dickson gang, made
some of the little man’s Sydney wage-earn-
ing admirers rub their eyes. Dates show that
he successfully concealed the secret both of the
negotiations and the final agreement, while
apparently pouring out his soul to his Socialistic
brothers. The lectures stipulated for may prove
consistent with Ben’s principles, but the manner
of managing the deal is pronounced covert and
crafty.
HERR FRIEDENTHAL—Iatest made-in-Germany pianist. Holder of
world’s records, paced and unpaced, on this machine.
One of the busiest of S. Australia’s
pioneers died a few days ago—John Ragless, aged
84. He was one of the earliest farmers in the
north, his first holding being at Enfield, which is
now in the suburbs. Then, as settlement extended,
he and his brothers dotted the lower north with
flour-mills. But by-and-bye, when the railway
came, all the grain was brought to the city ; and
nowadays one comes every twenty miles or bo
upon substantial ruins of what he is told was a
mill —“ in the good days.”
At a certain big up-country town a great
tug-of-war was on. Excitement ran high, and
the Irish-Australians were hot favorites for the
pull-off against Ireland. Father Tom—good old
man ! —waited on the 1.-A. team and
“ Sure, bhoys, ye wouldn’t bate yer forefathers ! ”
The bhoys said it was pretty hard to lose the
honor and money too. “ Make yer moind aisy,
bhoys, but not a word—Oi’ve made ’em promise
the money to me church.” And on Sunday the
fine old fellow paid a high tribute to the glorious
race he’d sprung from.
Of the 10 Conventionists elected by N.S. W.
to frame the Federal Bill, seven were native Aus-
tralians, two Scotch, and one Irish. The seven
native Australians are in the fight, to-day, six of
them-Barton, Carruthers R. E. O Connor, Wise,
Abbott and Brunker— solidly for the Bill, and one
-Lyne-against. Of the Scots, Reid is actively
and J. T. Walker quiescently for; and the sole
Irishman, M'Millan, has bolted to distant parts.
S.A. Chief Justice Sammy Way has got
his baronetcy, after refusing three knighthoods.
After his marriage to Mrs. Blue and family, they
said in Adelaide that the lady had all her own
way and Sammy had the blues; but he has had
his own way too. That small sturdy Portsmonthian
has ’umbled the ’aughty minions of the Colonial
Office, and become Australia’s hereditary title-
holder No. 3, in his 64th year. Where there s a
way, there’s a will.
TOO AWFUL.
HE: “ Dreamt I was in Hades last night.”
S HE: "Oh! Did you find it hot enough? ”
HE: “ By Jove, yes; but the worst of it was the place was
full of good liquor, and my mouth had healed up.”
When Chief Justice Madden descanted on
St. Mary Magdalen at the Tod-Radalyski trial,
Father O’Farrell, the Ballarat Redemptionist,
thundered against the C.J. from Sc. Francis
pulpit, Melbourne, and scornfully denied that
Mary was the woman who was “a sinner in the
city.” Poor Madden humbly replied that he had
always been taught she was. (He was educated
at St. Patrick’s College). Now, an anonymous
priest, “ C. 0.5.,” tackles the subject in the R.C.
magazine, Austral Light, and says that Mary
Magdalen, Mary of Bethany, and the city sinner
were “one and the same person.” The struggle
to identify the lady who was casually mentioned
1900 years ago grows interesting.
Dear Bulletin. —
Your reference to the
N.S.W. Braddon in a
recent issue is slightly
wrong. The N.S.W.
anti-Federal Braddon
is H. Y. Braddon, the
ex-footballer from
Maoriland, a son, not
a nephew, of Premier
Braddon. He is of
Dalgety and Co., who,
I believe, are not un-
connected with wool
and hides, and have
been heard of round
Circular Quay. Hence
the difference of opin-
ion. Strange that at
the bottom of most of
the Sydney and sub-
urban opposition to
the Bill there is a
strong smell of “ ’ides
and taller, taller and
’ides,” also of wool,
both scoured and
greasy. I believe also
pelts are unfavorable
to the Bill, as are
rough splits, butts and
basils. I cannot under-
stand the coldness of basils towards Federation,
but the opposition of Dalgety and Co. is ex-
plainable to babes and sucklings.— Locust.
Ex-N.S.W. Gov. Hampden had a unique
experience in that he had but one set of Ministers
during his stay in Australia.
The coming chess champion of Australia
seems to be C. G. Watson, a Jewish-looking youth
of barely 21. Son of Marriott Watson, Melb.
solicitor, and relative of the Ballarat parson and
the English novelist, this brilliant boy carried off
local honors the other day, and drew against
Wallace in the Birthday interprovincial match.
He is at present studying for a law-exam., and
only plays the royal game as a pastime.
A. B. Worthington, the Temple of Truth
apostle, recently shook the mud of Christchurch,
M.L., from his feet, and proposes to start a glory-
shop in Melbourne. A.B. W. is the clever Yankee
preacher whose way of mixing religion with easy
divorce caused a Christchurch crowd to go tempo-
rarily on the riot. He had just come from Hobart,
where, though the folks mobbed Chiniquy, they
rather liked Worthington’s style and the mystery
that surrounded him.
Quaint Yictorian item
Through the Bishop of Ballarat (Right
Rev. Dr. Moore), Mr. Thomas Kinsella, mine-
owner, of Siawell, and family, have been
made the recipients of a very great favor
from his Holiness the Pope. Accompanying
a full-length photograph of his Holiness is a
decree granting, under the usual conditions,
to Mr. Kinsella and family, to the third
generation, a plenary indulgence in a
rticulo mortis (at the hour of death). Six
sets of rosary beads, blessed by the Pope,
with special indulgences attached, were
also presented to the family. It may not be
generally known that favors such as these
are exceedingly rare, and are bestowed only
on Catholics of well-known piety and gene-
rosity towards the Church. We congratulate
Mr. Kinsella and family on being so highly
favored. Only last year, through the Arch-
bishop of Melbourne and the Bishop of Bal-
larat, Mr. Kinsella had presented to the
Pope, for the Vatican Muiseum, some very
fine specimens of gold-bearing quartz, whch
were much appreciated.
The Spanish R.C. Bishop Sal-
vado, of New Norcia (W. A.), now said
to be in flourishing circumstances, had
to trust for a monetary lift to his know-
ledge of the piano in the early days
of his mission to the aborigines. He
broken - bootedly tramped down to
Ferth, his trousers patched with cloth
of different colors, and proposed a con-
cert, partly music and partly talkee-
talkee. Sympathy and curiosity filled
the house, and with the proceeds he
bought a team of bullocks and started
back as driver to New Norcia. An-
other time, when stumped, he adver-
tised in Ferth papers that he would
open a Perth music salon, but that all
intending pupils should pay him a
year in advance. N umbers who didn’t
want the music paid the cash. The
bishop was in early life an excellent
pianist and a composer of some re-
pute.
Mr. C. B. Stephen, now again in practice
in Sydney, is the oldest but one N.S. W. practising
barrister wearing “stuff.” He was “called” before
Barton, Reid, O’Connor, Heydon and other
Q.C.’s, and has been offered “silk” again and
again without avail. He is a son of the late Chief
Justice Stephen.
When the popular Father O’Regan was
leaving Hobart wharf the other day for Mt.
Lyell, where he is in future to mine for miners’
souls, the St. Mary’s band gave him a send-off.
One of the items was “The Girl I Left Behind
Me.” His reverence was so tickled by the tune
that he ordered the boys he left behind him on the
pier to be fed to suffocation.
Signor Simonetti has done a bust of the
late Q. Premier Byrnes, and is bent on a statue of
the same subject, “ the size and details of which
will depend upon the amount of the subscriptions
received and the Government subsidy.” (0 fertile
cow !) Now, statues last very long. In 10 years,
people will be asking “ Who was Byrnes?” Or,
rather, they won’t be asking.
Poor old James Cock, who reached S.A.
in the first year of its settlement, has lately been
given an asylum in Parliament by a sympathetic
country constituency. But he was too feeble to
contest the last election ; and the old pioneer’s
extremity is so great that friends have been pro-
moting a local concert to raise enough money to
tide him over a few more months.
Catherine H. Spence, S.A.’s leading
woman reformer, lecturer, and author, is 74
years old, and has been driving a virile pen in S.A.
since the forties. Miss Spence practically edited
the South Australian as far back as 1850, and
was on the editorial staff of S.A. Register for
many years. She makes a hobby of the Hare
system of voting, and the author was one of her
earliest personal friends. Miss Spence was a per-
sistent advocate of Woman’s Suffrage long before
it was put on S.A. statute book.
Pity that the brainiest men of Q. Labor-
party should be so physically fragile. Especially is
this true of leader Dawson and clever little
Browne, of Croydon. The complaint is the
customary one among intellectual men—chest-
trouble. The man who cannot sit up night after
night with impunity, and sleep cat-like whenever
he pleases, and eat and drink almost whatever he
pleases, will find brains by no means the only
desiderata for a successful politician.
That somewhat notorious Q. political
identity, Mathew Battersby, who died the other
day, was one of those curious anomalies—a work-
ing-man Conservative. He had a large heart, but
an empty head, and his sudden death is attri-
buted to his recent election defeat and the general
blackness of his future prospects. He was never
mentally strong enough to do any harm in the
world, and will be remembered for his virtues—
steadfastness, candor, and generosity.
Exit Brown, head of Yic. Criminal Investi-
gation Department. The failure of his men in the
Archer case (the murderer was arrested by uni-
formed police) and the boot-trunk affair made the
old man ill—the tote-case knocked him out. A
born detective, of unerring memory, polite and
firm, he was feared and respected by the criminal
class—for he “gave them a chance.” Meeting
(say) Smith he would say : “ What are yon
doing?” “Nothing at present, sir.” “Well, I'll
give you a week ; if not, I'll find you a job.” He
was as good as his word, and Smith and co. knew
it.
The crawl-down of Frank Madden (Yic.
M.L.A.) in the matter of his accusations of
land-fraud against the Lands Department and
David Syme, looks very abject indeed. The loud-
mouthed F.M. declared in Parliament that he
was ready to prove his accusations before any
tribunal that might be . appointed. Whereupon
Premier Turner asked the Judges to select one of
their number to be the tribunal before which
Madden could prove his charges, and they selected
Judge Williams. And then Madden (who had
given his word that he was ready to support his
accusations before any tribunal) refused to appear
at all and has consistently stayed away ever
since.
A junior reporter's report of a scientific
leoture was sent by a Sydney newspaper with the
editor’s compliments to the lecturer, one day
lately, with a request that the lecturer would
revise the MS. for publication. The lecturer sent
back the MS., saying that if the newspaper pub-
lished such a farrago of nonsense and called it a
lecture of his, he would sue for exemplary
damages.
If it is not too late for a burst of Birthday
loyalty, The Bulletin would like to remark,
with tears in its eyes, that the Queen is a Woman
—God bless her ! The day after her marriage she
wrote to Baron Stockmar— “There cannot exist a
purer, dearer, nobler being in the world than the
Prince.” How feminine ! Manly purity is one
of those matters which only an ardent bride can
fully understand.
“ J.D.” : Hardly fair to call Tas. Ministry
the P.U.B. crowd. Braddon is strictly a club
man ; Pillinger rarely saw the inside of a pub. ;
and Urquhart, since becoming Attorney-General,
has hardly exchanged a smile with a barmaid.
Present Ministry’s initials —B-raddon, R-eibey,
U-rquhart, M-oore, M-iles—makes either con-
tracted Brummagem or contracted Bumm’r. Both
names fit beautifully.
Kelly had his birthday on 30th. May,
when he was standing out of the Australian team
at Oxford. Trumble and Worrall enjoyed a
joint birthday whilst the match with Essex was
proceeding, and Iredale’s fell due on Sunday last.
The other ten men, also manager Wardill, happen
to have been born outside of the English cricket
season, so the 10th Eleven will not have any more
birthday rejoicings to contend against.
Apropos the recent death at Perth hospital
of Father Long, who was said to possess the secret
of the “ golden sickle,” or “sacred ” nugget. The
now-accepted yarn is that a big slug was found by
prospectors on somebody else’s lease, and was
ultimately cut into three pieces and sent away
from Kanowna. The deceased padre, who was a
strong favorite “ wid the bhoys,” appears to have
been badly rattled by his ecclesiastical superiors
over the nugget business.
Concerning E. P. Field, erstwhile a well-
known figure in Sydney (the death of his father,
Major-General Field, a distinguished Indian
officer, was cabled the other day) : —
Barrister-Evangelist E. P. Field, now in England, seems
to have abandoned the law ; his appointment as General
Secretary, in England, of the Evangelical Alliance is an-
nounced. The herculean Field was a decided person-
ality. Once he was associate to a Queensland Judge;
after arriving in Sydney he fell on hard times, and man-
fully went to work humping bags of salt on the wharf.
Presently he was admitted to N.S.W. bar, and gradually
built up an excellent District Court practice ; also, he
occasionally appeared in the Supreme Court, and was the
only junior barrister who ever fairly stood up to Judge
Windeyer and “gave as good as he got.” Which fact
gained him much admiration and practical sympathy
from many attorneys ; likewise, it earned for him the
emphatic enmity of the Judge, whom Field presently
sued for alleged slander, uttered at a meeting of Sydney
School of Arts, on the committee of which both were.
Field was beaten in the lawsuit, and Windeyer sold up
his little sticks for costs. One day Field (who had been a
somewhat fleshly man, after the manner of the average
Hercules) consulted a surgeon re a growth in his throat,
and was told it was cancer. The news, when confirmed
by other doctors, blanched his face, as well it might. He
determined, as a last resort, on going to English
specialists, and went round farewelling his friends for
ever; also, he met his enemy, Windeyer, who wept on
his neck, and they forgave one another. When Field got
as far as Melbourne, he called on Surgeon Iredell, who
assured him that his throat-trouble wasn’t cancer at all,
and would probably disappear on the voyage—which
prediction was verified. But, all the same, Field was
permanently “ converted ” ; when he returned to Sydney
he would meet men to whom he erstwhile made vain and
worldly remarks and surprise them by softly and sympa-
thetically taking them by the arm and enquiring whether
they ever gave thought to their immortal souls—this
with a quiet “My dear old friend, you won’t mind my

giving you these little books, do read them for my sake "
—thrusting into your hand a tract or two, which you
would take from Field though you never accepted such
things from any other man. Also, he would spend every
lunoh-time, even on the most broiling or wintry day,
singing hymns with his little knot of colleagues on a
vacant lot in Martin-place, his head reverentially hared
the while ; and on Sunday afternoon he would preach and
sing in front, of the beach at Coogee ; and all spare hours
were spent in visiting poor people and trying to comfort
the sick. Of course his law-practice went to the devil.
But he, the handsome, once-fashionably-dressed giant,
aforetime the cynosure of every female eye, cared not if
he had now to' wear a shabby coat : he had become a
practical Christian with an unearthly eye ever fixed on
things unseen of ordinary mortal man. He was one of
the few apparently-real Christians this scribe has ever
met, and when the present writer conies to believe what
Field believes and what parsondom says it believes, he,
too, will cast away all care for the concerns of this earth
and sell all he possesses and give to the poor.

“Steele Rudd’s” “Dad” has
come to town after 40 years in the wildei’ness.”
A pretty good record. But here’s a better.
.Recent papers print obituaries of a former manager
f ar \ western squattage, and one of
the Darling pioneers. He was out there 45
a worse wilderness surely than even
Dad s. ’ In late years he wandered once
or. twice into Broken Hill, but no further.
His wife, still living, has travelled far less. The
only township she has seen—in 45 years- is Men-
(population, excluding goats, say 250), and
she hasn’t been in there since ’6O-something.
Draft, graft, graft all those years, and now four
years of drought to top it up with. What a life !

A Brisbane Salvarmy captain lately held
an audience of Boothites entranced while he told
them a story of his cattle-lifting days. After
planting the beasts he had stolen, on one occasion,
deponent averred, he was so unlucky as to drop
across a policeman and tracker. When told to sur-
render, the cattle-thief replied that he hadn’t time,
and cut across country till he came to a wire fence.
Cut through it in a jiffy. (Met'od of breaking a
wire fence illustrated to admiring audience).
Slowed-down then and hoisted himself into a tree,
sending his horse on to be chased by the minions
of the law. This story sends Brisbane Salva-
tionists into raptures, especially when an old cab-
horse is ridden furiously across the back of the
stage by the veracious officer aforesaid. Even the
saints themselves admire the man who once had
spunk enough to be a hearty sinner.

For the perfect moa’s egg (there are but
two perfect specimens in existence) lately hauled
up from a river-bed by a M.L. gold-dredge, one of
the Rothschildren cabled an offer of ,£4OO. The
finder was patriotic enough to accept a smaller bid
from Dunedin Museum. There is talk of a law-
suit between owners of dredge and finder as to
rights of property in the egg.

In a Ahaura (M.L.) hostelry is a billiard-
table vvith a unique “cloth,” consisting of wall-
posters of various designs. While attempting the
spot stroke you see “ Vote for Skrugsly, the
Prohibition Candidate,” staring up at you, and in
playing from baulk you spot your ball on one of
Eillis’ elephants. When the “cloth” is ripped,
the marker, who has a huge collection of posters,
just pastes a glaring sheet over the tear, and the
game is resumed. It is only the visitor who is
taken aback, the habitues seem quite satisfied.
Said of Weiss and Memmott that these two billiard
celebrities once poked their heads into this room,
and when they saw the cloth they made sure they
had “got ’em again.” People only play for drinks
at Ahaura.

Bush luck ! He was a nice pup and the
family were very fond of him, but Dad was still
away “ lookin’ for work ” and there wasn’t a cent
in the house and very little tucker. So the mother
decided to take the offer of 15s. for the dog and
live on the proceeds and the solitary hen and
seven chickens (all the remaining live-stock), till
her old man came back. She sent word to the
buyer, and by the time he arrived the dog had
killed all the poultry, picked up a bait and pegged
out; and verily the last state of that family was
worse than the first.

one I shot that was minus a joey in the pouch, but
with no satisfactory result until a few days
ago, when I found a doe’s teats much swol- ( f
len at the base, and, on opening her up, /w
found young ’roo as lively as a cricket,
though mother had been dead fully 10
minutes. Have preserved young one, womb
and teats, and will send along, if requested.

“G.”: Every middle-aged man has a re-
gret or two. My only one is that I was not a
soldier. What think you of this for a run of
luck ? One day, was going out duck-shooting with
a publican. He fooled round with his weapon,
before we started, and she went off. Charge went
through the frame of a picture 4in. above my
head. After the smoke had cleared away, I found
my friend “all of aheap.” He, thinking I was
dead, had fainted. Next day, went to a butcher’s
place to buy a dog. Butcher was going to shoot
bullock, and came in to get cap for old muzzle-
loader. Hammer was a “bit stiff,” and he got
pulling it about. Then it slipped. I stood at
door, and the bullet knocked the ash clean off my
cigar. He was a thorough gentleman, and apolo-
gised. He’d had two rums. A week later, rode
out of a paddock, and joined a man I’d never seen
before. We had ridden together about 50yds.,
when a cwt. limb fell between us from a height of
40ft. Other man had his face slightly scratched,
and the limb buried itself almost out of sight in
the ground. Eew days afterwards, went up a
eucalyptus to chase a bear off. Jumped froth that
tree fair on a death-adder. One foot was planted
about an inch below his head. The next jump was
my best effort, to date. As a soldier, with my luck I
could have got up a very cheap reputation for valor.

bushmen. At a Murray River township two men,
doing a small contract, got a “sub” of £7,
promptly handed the cheque over the pub.-bar,
and had two days’ solid (i.e., liquid) enjoyment.
Third day they sobered up enough to ask if there
was anything left, and the publican (a new hand,
needless to say) told them they were still <£3 to
the good. “Oh,” said one, “hand it over, and

“ Best bit of tracking ever Jseen,” said
the old man, “ was when Tim Dooley’s mare,
Mavourneen, was stole two nights before Turn-
beroola Cup. It was two blokes from Shiloh
Downs did the trick. When we was playin’
hazard in the bar, about one in the morning, they
slips out with a couple of blankets, breaks the
padlock off of the loose-box door, and walks the
mare acrost the blankets into an empty box at
the end of the stable. In the mornin’ there was
a row—old Tim tearing round, swearing sudden
death to the thieves. He sent for the police, an’
a trooper come down with a black tracker, who
picked up the tracks about 200yds. from the pub.,
an’ away he goes, with about 50 of us after him.
There was two of ’em, the nig. said, on horseback
—one leading Mavourneen an’ t’other behind.
‘Them Ryans !’ sings out old Tim, an’
wanted to make for the selection right away, but
the trooper said ‘ No; let Jimmy follow ’em up.
They’ll have planted her, maybe.’ Well, we fol-
lowed them tracks for about 14 mile, an’ then we
come on a stony ridge, an’ the nig. couldn’t pick
’em up on the other side. So the trooper said
they’d made for the Wall, an’ he’d go back an’
get the sergeant an' a fresh horse, an’ nab the pair
of ’em. You see, we all knew it was the Ryans I>y
this time. When we got back to the pub. Tim
opened the bar, an’ give the trooper a bottle of
whisky, and the nigger ten bob, an’ sent him
down to Flanagan’s to get a suit of clothes at
Tim’s expense. An’ just then we heard a whinny
in the yard, an’ we all made a rush. An’ there
the mare was in the end loose-box, singin’ out for
her tucker. An’ next day Flanagan sent up his
bill for the nigger’s suit of clothes. But Mavour-
neen won the cup all right, so Tim paid for ’em.
But if it hadn’t been for that stony ridge, that
nig. would ’a’ been on them tracks yet 1 ”

why a dog ?

An aboriginaliment ; the blackfeliow as a
gourmet :
“ Bend D.” : Our Queensland “ niggers ” don’t live en-
tirely on ’possum and snake. They have their little
luxuries—the cabbage-tree-core amongst them. The
blacks select a tree under 6in. in dia., chop it down level
with ground, cut off about 2ft. of trunk, split it, and out
rolls a fine “ lolly-stick ” 2ft. long and about 2in. thick.
The taste is between those of a common cabbage and a
banana, but sweeter than either. Writer has often eaten
and relished it, but generally felt the want of the brandy-
and-port-wine specific soon afterwards. Blacks in the
M'Kinley Ranges have lived entirely on this stuff for
weeks when hiding after a cattle-spearing. Again, the
banks of the Leichhardt for 100 miles are (or were)
covered with water-melons ; and I once watched a mob of
myalls come in from a back track, walk into the river
till the water was level with their mouths, drink, and
then proceed to tap melons. Each one grabbed the
biggest melon handy, lifted it above his head, and bashed
it on to the ground. If the pieces were red, all right; if
not, tap another. But the luxury : Was camped once
near Planet Downs—on the Comet River, Q. —when an
old “flour-bag” nigger came up and told me he was

“ one fig tumbacca” he’d sell me four wild-turkey eggs.
I bought, and he “yanned.” But he evidently kept his
only eye on me, for just as I was taking the first pair of
boiled eggs out of the quart-pot, up came Wheelbarrow,
running his own tracks and pretending to be searching
for something. “By eras, ole man, mine bin lose ’im
that one tumbacca ; you gib it ’nother fulla?” Here I
knocked the roofs off the eggs and found—ugh ! But
Wheelbarrow interposed. “ Baal you .chuck him ’way ?

“Rets.” : Real cause of “ Barcoo ” has not
yet been mentioned. The heat of the sun acting
on a set of nerves which go from back of neck
to stomach sets up stomachic irritation, so that
the merest trifle will bring on the sickness. To
keep the back of the neck well covered is the
surest preventive, but a little cream of tartar and
baking-soda taken in water at first symptoms is
very effective.
* * * *
“Scotty the Wrinkler” : It isn’t fat, or
flies, or penny-royal that causes “Barcoo.” The
trouble invariably comes after eating fat and
sugar. Allow an observant cook to note that.
Brownie, plum-duff, rolly-polly, or meat-pie cum
sweet tea and hot weather. What can you ex-
pect? Barcoo or Barcoo rot is cachexy, caused
by climate and diet of “10, 10, 2 and a-quarter.”
* * • •
“ Wilcannia” : Barcoo vomit is caused, in
my opinion, by the scent (or pollen) of some herb
or plant. Have spent years on western side of
Darling, and have always noticed that when cer-
tain species of “ everlasting plants ” were in bloom
“Barcoo ” was prevalent. Best remedy, I agree,
is tablespoonful of L. and P. sauce before each
meal.

“A. 5.8.”: Up amongst the Mulgrave I
was camped on a high point where two creeks
meet, and (from the way the creeks turned about)
was surrounded by tumbling water. I had turned
in, and while listening to the sound of the rushing,
boulder-blocked water, something gave a click in
my ears; when immediately - the monotonous
noise of the waters turned to harmonies, to sym-
phonies in every key, deep as hell and high as
heaven, from the shriek of despair and the moan
of misery to the rapture of ecstatic joy. My every
sense was centred in hearing. I saw, I touched,
I tasted, I smelt music, and my whole being
was, so to speak, in the seventh heaven of sound
for about an hour. The cause ? The wing of a
flying ant in one ear —and I am deaf on the other !

WATSON’S WHISKY.
A young lady applied, the other dav, for a posi-
tion as companion. To her dismay, she found her
proposed charge was an insane lady, of whom she
was to have aim ost complete charge. ‘ ‘ What about
night-time ? ” she asked. “ You must sleep alone
with her, of course, ” was the reply. “ But ” (in a
reassuring tone) ‘ ‘ she has never, as yet, been known
to harm anyone ! ” “ And the salary ? ” “Five
shillings a week.” “That seems very little.”
“It isn’t much ; that is why we advertised for a
lady instead of a servant. Of course, we could
not expect a servant to take the salary. ” Truly a
mad world, my masters.
In the pursuit of a hobby, the
finer shades of honesty are often
lost sight of. At a recent “ at-
home ” in a fashionable suburb, a
lady, whose strong point is her gar-
den, and whose weak point the sur-
reptitious abstraction of “cuttings,”
with which to beautify the same,
met with an absolute calamity. In
this way. A slip of a rare, a very
lovely, carnation, had, after several
unsuccessful manoeuvrings, at last
found a not-lonely passage down the
folds of her parasol. With a faith
quite beautiful, the gamp was then
left with those of the other guests
in the hall. Time for departure
arrived. Owner hunted high and
low for the receptacle of stolen
goods. In vain. She looked around
in desperation, to see a lady with it
in her hand passing at that moment
down the steps to the footpath. The
agitated female rushed upon her.
“Excuse me,” she gasped, “you
have made—you have made a mis-
take ! I think—l am almost sure—
that is my parasol ! ” The tem-
porary bailee of the brolly glanced
at the owner a moment, and—opened
that sunshade with a sudden jerk !
Confusion worse confounded —and
carnation, cuttings in abundance.
She smiled. Several people, with
bad manners, smiled, too. “Yes,”
she said, with a sweet little bow as
she handed it over, “it was a mis-
take ; they are so alike—both gold
knobs. I like gold knobs; don’t
you ? But I think —I am quite sure
—this parasol is yours. Opened,
yours has a border of flowers. Mine
is—er—plain. ”
See the “Three Musketeers,” if
you haven’t done so already. In it
are several Australian elements that
ought to be encouraged. Notably,
Bernard Espinasse’s finger in the
masonry of the play, which pre-
sents some fine situations, and
Lilian Wheeler’s acting. The
latter is playing Miladi with grace and
meaning, and dressing her with a free hand
and an artist’s eye. To me, there is some-
thing refreshingly sane in Miss Wheeler’s
acting. Girlish though she is, and though
she does not hit hard enough sometimes, she
seldom hits a wrong note. And her frocks
are lovely. She makes a dashing picture in a
tremendous red hat, decked with long red feathers
shading into pink. With this she wears a freakish
black gown, owning a train and cape lined with
white satin under scarlet velvet trappings, a white
satin petticoat barred with red velvet, and a wide

cream collar turning back over her cape. Another
striking frock was a daring study in orange. The
front was heavily embroidered in dull gold, and
dozens of little bows of vivid orange ran up and
down each side of this splendor. A mocking little
rosette of black and orange took the place of a hat.
Miss Roxy Barton also oontrives a few tableaux,
the most artistic being a dove-grey gown with
cape showing turquoise linings, and a big grey
feathered hat.
But what of the Three Musketeers themselves ?
Alas! they bear an unmistakably home-made
brand, as far as clothes go (and they go a long,
long way in a historical play, even when the his-
tory takes walks occasionally and forgets to come
baok). Instead of being too big for their boots—
and surely, if ever men were that, those men,
Porthos, Athos, and Aramis, were—they seem to
shrink away into their leggings, as if they knew
there were bits of lace that didn’t match, or mis-
fits in their toilettes generally. Rignold’s d’Ar-
tagnan also reveals a few spots on his armor. He
is such an old-young boy. And he puffs and
mouths—fluffs is the technical name for it, I be-
lieve—-as if he had rolled his puffing Othello and
panting Falstaff into one, which is not a woman’s
idea of d’Artagnan, anyway.
I am sure that Charity sometimes wishes it had
begun, and remained, at home. A district deacon-
ess got a sickly shudder, the other day, when
calling on a poor woman with nine children and
husband out of work. “ I would like to see some
of the children,” said the deaconess, with that
awing kindness that so terrifies and inconveni-
ences the poor. Instead of a candid, “They’re
too dirty to be seen, Miss,” presently a hurried
scuffling was heard at the back, which meant that
the mother was wetting her apron corner in her
mouth and giving a grubby face a hasty clean-up.
The scuffling continued. Then an angry child’s
voice sobbed out, “I don’t tare if there is tom -
pany, I won’t be washed wif spit! ” Anybody
who writes to say this story isn’t original must
send a cash deposit with the letter as an evidence
of good faith.
Apropos of spirits. A Mel-
bourne lady lately wrote to her
daughter in Brisbane: “I have
had a message from your father,
and he says he is in Brisbane
looking after you.” When this
letter arrived, Mary was too ill
to read it, so it fell into her hus-
band’s hands. That part about
Mary’s father puzzled him. “I
thought you told me your father
was dead, ” he said to her curi-
ously. “Yes, he died twenty
years ago,” said Mary. After
that, the husband believed he
know the whole case. Mary was
too ill to be bothered, but he
was perfectly certain that the old
man had done something shady,
and that they had never told
Mary. Every day he expected
to be bailed up by a disreputable
old gaol-bird with an awful past
who would shatter all the proud
family traditions. At last his
worry drove him to say to Mary,
“What does your mother mean
by saying your father is in Bris-
bane ? ” And out came the simple
explanation, “Father’s quite
dead, but mother is a spiritual-
ist ! ”
If veils go out, as they threa-
ten to dG, other things that go
under veils will have to go out
too. Then we shall see what
we have nearly forgotten, the
genuine Australian complexion.
When rouge follows nature’s
tints, there are women who look
better for it. But when you see
a yellow cheek with a round
magenta flush on it, or a white
face burning with a bluish-pink
fever, or a fair skin under the red
that belongs only to a brunette’s
coloring, or a dark face trying
to look at home in a pink-bloom, you
realise that woman’s art is nothing but a saying
after all.
A ‘‘dear little boy” of seven was recently un-
dergoing a viva-voce examination at school.
Geography was his strong point, and ho was fully
expected to take the prize. But he didn’t. The
exam, happened as follows—“ What is the capital
of Saxony?” “Dresden.” “What is the capital
of England ? ” “London.” “What is the capital
of N.S. Wales?” “Melbourne.” How G. Re-
publican Dibbs would adore that bright little boy!
Not even yet do they know all about Australia
in England. An Englishwoman who has been
living in Sydney for the last twenty years went
home lately to see her people. One of her English
relatives gave her a nasty slap. She was about to
be taken to visit a very intellectual and aristo-
cratic cousin at Oxford, Just before starting, her
aunt came into her room and said, in a persuasive,
conciliatory sort of way, “Emily, dear, do you
know, I think if I were you I wouldn’t tell Julius
how long you have been in Australia ! ”
When a colonial girl visits “ Home ” she finds
that that accent goes dead against her. I saw a
letter the other day from an Australian girl strug-
gling for the singer’s wreath. It was quite
pathetic. “I can sing, but I can’t speak, ” she
said ; “and they won’t believe you can sing if you
can’t speak. Sometimes I think I have dropped
the ‘ colonial ’ accent for ever. I find myself
using little English vowels with much brevity and
point, and fly along over my sentences with a
crisp patter. And then, one day, always on an
important occasion when there’s a ‘ Somebody ’ to
please, an awful lumpish nervousness comes upon
me, and back come all the broad, bad ways of my
youth, until to resist them would result in affecta-
tion worse than yards of vowels. It doesn’t
matter what you are, what you know, what you
can do—you are judged to be common and pro-
vincial as soon as you say ‘ good diay.’ ”
And only a few months ago an English school
was having a little Australian geography exam.
The meaning of “squatter” was asked for. To
which the bright pupil replied—“ A squatter is a
species of animal with feet webbed like a duck, is
a mammal, and lays eggs.” She was thinking of
the duck-billed platypus, which is what most
English people think of when they think of Aus-
tralia at all.
Out of the golden, remote, wild West comes the
story of a wedding. On the day of this knot-
tying the bridegroom got hopelessly, speechlessly,
leglessly drunk. Some friends sent to tell the
bride, who lived out of the township, not to come
in till an hour or so later. But the parson had
another engagement, and refused to wait. The
friends spent two hours searching for another
cleric. Two refused the job, but finally a Baptist
consented to be carted away with the bridegroom
to the bride’s home, and the knot was tied.
Strangely—and suspiciously—enough, the bride-
groom had been engaged four times previously to
girls in the district, and never in his life had he
been known to be drunk before ‘‘ in the daytime. ”
The strangest sight I ha ve seen for a long time was
a man riding on a bike to a funeral. The procession
was going to Gore Hill cemetery. Certainly
there was a black bow tied in the middle of his
wheel. But the cabs and carriages had all to
quicken their pace to his, and the people in the
neighborhood were shocked beyond all funereal
language.
An awful warning of what may happen to a
beauty-man ! Into a fancy shop, the other day,
came a thin, angular, maiden lady, with a sharp
nose and a geometric figure. “ I want to see some
photographs of Julius Knight,” was what she said.
She turned over dozens. Julius, as Marcus in
flowing white. Julius fully clad as the Prisoner
of Zenda. Julius very scantily draped as Pyg-
malion. At last she fixed on one that was very
much Julius and not much haberdashery. “ And
now I want a frame.” Frames were brought. She
spent half-an-hour in searching for one good
enough for her idol. Finally, she was seen push-

frame made of pink and blue shells, such as one
keeps for the pictures of angels given away for
good behavior at Sunday-school.
Poor old Robert Russell is the surveyor
who laid out Melbourne in 1836. (The boomsters
and the banks laid it out in 1893 in another way).
He is now 92 years old, and with his wife, nearly as
old, is stranded in the city he planned with hardly
a penny to his name. The old man describes how
he designed the original city with 99-feet streets
throughout, and was only blocked in his scheme
by the pigheadedness of the Sydney authorities,
who forced the introduction of the 33-feet interme-
diate thoroughfares which are the only blot on
the plan of the southern city. Mr. Russell con-
siders himself entitled to a Govt, pension, but
Premier Turner has declined, passing him on
to the City Council. The City Council says
that its legal rights won’t let it subscribe;
and as he positively declines to accept private
assistance the poor nonagenarian seems in a
bad way. Surely some of the Melbournites
who testimonialise anybody and everybody will
promote an entertainment to raise an annuity for
the veteran.

withdrawal of his head he would rub it against his fore-

Touched him at last with point of fishing-rod, when he

add that same evening I caught a 41b. Eng. trout, and,
weather being very hot, tethered him in the stream over-
night. Next morning found a similar-sized fish appar-
ently trying to swalluw the prisoner. Hooked_ the canni-
bal at second cast with a grasshopper, landed him, and
found him Jib. heavier than the other. The captive trout
had had his tail-end badly chewed for about 3in. up.

We are goin’ to found a nation,
And we’ll shout hurrah for Union in the mornin’!
And we’ll shout hurrah for Union in the mornin’!
When the birth of New Australia is a-dawnin’!
From the Tweed to Yackandandah,
Bot’ny Bay to Booliander,
We will shout hurrah for Union in the mornin’!

COME IN OUT OF THE WET!
DR. MACLAURIN : “ It is impossible for us to federate without our natural ally, Queensland."
CHEAT CARS All, I NEVER DREAMT HE’D COME!
DR MACLAURIN : "If we federate without Queensland the extra taxation will he equal to 22/6 per head per annum. If Queensland
comes in, things will be much worse —fully 20,6 per head per annum."

No notice will be taken of communications insufficiently

No liability is undertaken in any case re contribu-
tions voluntarily submitted, whether sent by post or
handed in, and in no case will MS. be returned un-
less stamps (of any province) accompany.
E.K. : You can’t wipe out “General” Booth
»ike that. Where is the other man who could make
thousands of women wear a hideous uniform and poke-
bonnet, kneel in the mud, and say they are happy?
Nella: You don’t mean to say your publican beak fines
the people who get drunk in his own hotel? T.R.V. :
One poem, by Perdition from Chaos, sent to its father
W.T.H. (Cue) : Pity such good men should have such bad
poeLry written about them. . , N.S. (Lone House): Thought
it was a tragedy. Proved to be only a caterpillar
A.G. : We believe in Federation, and your well-meant
whoop isn’t the kind of thing we would throw at any
cause we believe in Baines: No Maffra : Eighteen
verses about an ordinary country dance. This is a paper,
not a, tank A.G. : The perfect remedyfor seat-jumping
in railway carriages is not yet devised Annie B. : It’s
good jingle, but not good enough. Describe one inci-
dent ; you cover too much ground Worried : You
“ never come across an old Bulletin in the country.”
Quite understandable: this paper never grows old
Snakejuice : You simply can’t make a ballot-paper which
some enlightened person or other won’t bungle over
E.A.P. : You want to change “N.S.W.” to “Bright-
land,” do you? Then, when N.Q. separates it can be
called “ Scorchland.” And, if Gippsland ever parts from
Victoria and starts “ on its own,” it can be called “ Big-
treeslush.” And if Western N.S.W. and Queensland
(where all the old inhabitants are more or less “ balmy ”)
sep irate, the new inland province might be called
“ ltats.”, Meoro : You send 16 sides of MS. on 16 different
topics, and every side you have exactly filled, to the very
last line. Also, every side could be cut down by three-
fifths and still convey the sense, or nonsense, of what you
have written. If you seek to contribute, write
one day, boil it down the next—and go on boiling
it down. Then we’ll boil it down C.C.R. : Thank
Heaven we’ve found Religion. Nothing else would
enable us to stand it Roderic's Schoolmate: Re-
ligion proved useless in your case. Have fled to Rum.
E.D.: All you gentlemen reciters should subscribe to
The Bulletin, and cut out what you want. Can’t hunt
for vague clues over ten years’ files. But we’ll remember
you when “The Bulletin Reciter” comes along pre-
sently .. D.K.I. : Poem reads like a baker’s bill from the
last world —or the next. Tell us which you owe it in
Constance A. : No grit so far. Can’t say what 45 years’
struggle would accomplish .... D.B. : Why not run the
“ blue ” magazine yourself, and collect our subscription
to begin with? We ll visit you when you get into gaol
at the instance of the Y.M.C.A Cyn. : As if happens,
the answer to your query how best to conn.- i suicide is
waiting print. Is it “ a put-up job ” ? F.G.W. : Don’t
go hunting the antipodes for topics—hit us where we
live Camille : Sound sentiment—with the charm of
cold-boiled mutton in its second innings ... H.M. : You
say “ Peter denied his master and Joseph denied his mis-
tress.” Which is taking a mean advantage of the lady’s
unprotected condition T othersider : Paragraphs quite
tame and harmless, so have allowed them to run about in
the yard Ex-Salvationist : Grievance not very intelli-
gible, but would look better if it had its clothes on
M.F.B. : Poetical remarks to that lake should be drowned
there Thomas S.: Give it up Phoenix: All ashes
and no rise Helen B-.: Dialect-verse just fails to get
there M.H. : It has vigour; but subject already over-
parodied .....Siandro : Sydney is quite tired of the con-
sular dignity-and-precedence question, and desires to give
it a rest. .. M.O. (M.L.): Sorry to sav no special
encouragement offers in Australia. The teacher of
languages, save in very exceptional cases, here gets a
poor living .... M.J.K.: Subject worn out H.N. (B.) :
Unprintable old Dublin yarn Hugh M‘C. : No; Ar-
gonaut is very particular in such matters Maid
Marion : Crude and unsuitable Verdigris : Better send
that idea to the anti-Federal gang Tom Ungery:
Labored Josh Billings-isms... Cranbourne: Many thanks.
David G. : “Flood” and “Inspector’s Ride” lack
nearly everything that goes to make a story “The
Banging of N.S.W.” : Keep on apologising to Kipling.
The case requires it badly Boronia S.: Band won’t play
in this paper to-day Archie: Yarn’s a trifle flat
Brandon H. : Can’t find verses referred to. Are you sure
of date ? H.N. : Did you expect us to print that —even
if it hadn’t been well-stricken in years? W.H.B. :No
more “ Barcoo ! ” Yes, “Steele Rudd’s’’ book will be
out presently Alpar : Superfluous explanation ; every-
body knows that meaning of “Ten Commandments.”
W.G. : No; we don’t answer questions privately—nor
publicly either, unless short replies will serve John
D.R. (S.A.): As we can only with difficulty decipher your
letter and signature, your MS. was probably considered
too troublesome to worry about....T.W. (Black.) : Thanks
D.R.: Despairful cartoon idea to hand... Heimsdal :
Have looked it up, and find that the man named never
got 18 months for illegally using a police-horse, and he
was never sentenced for any offence committed in Gipps-
land. So your story is spoilt.... Oculus (Townsville):
Can’t publish wholesale libels on your mere unverified
say-so. Matter decidedly one to be settled locally
Kooka : Thanks.. .Nulla Nulla: Item about pair of
“flaming boots” extinguished ... A.X.N.T. : Awful-
just plain awful .... J.G. : The driver let you ride on the
loco. He drove very fast. You were scared. Nothing
happened. Great Scott ! ... Tialla : Thin conventional
t a ' e Sweet-briar: “ Boree Jack” too ordinary
Milano : Not worth space Aramac : Not much joke
R.P.T. : “ Horse up in the maintop ”is old Constance
A. : Not strong enough E. Wheatley Lane : “ Pro-
crastinative wails” wrecks your poem .... Itockton :
Thanks .. R.W.B. : Woman-shearer item too indefinite.
It is given as a record of fact, and we might be asked for
names and places ... Paddy C. (N.T.) : You aren’t a bit
amusing... Alfred E. B. : Good items ; but don’t be so
horribly long in the wind E.A.R. : Thanks Neila :
“Come and have a drink ” is a sentiment of which Bul-
letin approves, but it can’t say as much for the versifica-
tion thereof .... Pipe : “River” turns on very ancient
“surprise ’’-device ... Hawkins H. : Lacks force of nar-
ration. Mining-yarns so common that special merit is re-
flu'red John M. (Melb.) : “ Cornin’ Back is that why
it has no “go”? Styx: May possibly trim for print
David G. : But Morley has Gladstone’s biography well in
hand already.. Y. : Butcher-bird question already
settled in one act (B. 27/5/’99) ... J.A.K. : But, “the
following chestnut ” may not “ be cracked” —in Bulletin.
......Rick. : Australian bushwhackers don’t talk broad
Suffolk; and yarn isn’t new, anyhow . E.E.S. : 3rd time
within month we ve had that mailman-kangaroo antiquity
tried on us. Aren’t there any “ dawgs ” about ? Percy
R.M. : Hackneyed economic text with nothing new
about sermon John H.C. : No literary value
E.C.M. (Q.) : Lacks the dramatic treatment for which the
situation cries out John T. (Har. Vic.): You haven't
quite hit it H.M.T. : Verbose and Little Pedlingtonian.
Char. (W.A.): The doctor knows his business and
you don’t. Non-emetic doses of ipecac, are marvel-
lously effective in many cases of dysentery, and the
fact constituted a very great med.eal discovery' indeed
A. Richardson (M. L.): No time to negotiate on such
subjects. Besides, the very terms of vour offer imply
our refusal The P. : Trite Fancy Free (M.L.) :
Very trite and carries much preliminary lumber
Kylee : Point of Jap. yarn not clear. The others were
unsuitable... Flabby P. : Apparent . Moral don’t mix
your drinks ! H.O.H. : Useless to send us Tory yelps.
We vociferously applaud Seddon’s Old Age Pension
movement, and hope he’ll be able to extend it ere he
leaves office .... John D. (Tas.): Can’t re-reproduce photo-
nature prints : K.O. : Submit, it to the local kooka-
burra. ..E.C. : Sonnets too stiff ... L.A.W. : Verses too
long and tedious Flabby P. : But, if you’ve had ocular
demonstration that young emus accompany mother, why
ask the question ?... A.A.A. : Referring to “ B.” pars,
always give date S.C.O.J. : Not taking any more
jackass-snake ... Alvermarle : Shall have due considera-
tion Dareel: That cure recommended by score of
correspondents already Linden : “ Barcoo ” barred..
H.F.H. (Vic.): To hand . .. J.A.K. (W.A.): May never
have reached us. . .Yarruin : By sending us such
“ genuine antiques ” as that “ commandment ’’-yarn you
throw suspicion on your other matter F.C. • Funny,
in spots, but labored and mechanical otherwise. E.E.O.' :
When we found that he was “ tall and handsome as a
Greek god,” we got your exact measure. Don’t describe
descriptions ... Pipe : None of the verse up. “ Mistake,”
could all go in 20 lines. “ Biter,” doubtful E.M’D. :
Rather wooden, and rhymes forced in places. Horse-
verse has to be specially good, to have a show Madge
W. : Both too trifling .. Pascoe : “ Family Honor ” —too
bright and azure !.... Gobung : Printed, 27/5/’99. Others
ha " d - N ° verse-skill, and little promise otherwise;
though some items usable, with alteration H Dillon •
■No such verses in issue mentioned.. MxT. : Answer
accidentally applied to another. Whether game’s worth
candle must judge for yourself. You will always get fair
S°" Blde f ( atloa . Bandcutter : No; we never printed that
hnnJnr. Wl in ClSn - 1 uY ® ca .’P er : Question now definitely
nung-up. All weight of evidence against you, anyhow.
JacKb. : A man going into a mine to toil is never
sure of coming out alive.” Well, a man going out
°wn door is never sure of coming in alive! ....
D.W.K.: Thanks .... Oyster Johnnie: An old Bulletin story
J “ tear "P and obli Ke.” We have torn
and obliged 11. St. A.M. : Wouldn’t print those verses
—not even though your initials were X. St. Z.Q. Kola
(Toowoomba): Unsuitable .... 0.K.1. : In that peculiar
sentence both “and” and “or” are nouns Hoch-
kirch : 1 lease don't go threshing out that poor old
birthstain any more. The hirthstain that goes too
often to the well gets broken at last M.O.K. : Will trv
to diagnose the case with an axe Bandy : Item knock-
kn®fd H.S.P. (alelb.) : Whatever is suitable will be
published and paid for ... T.S. (Ad.) : You cavort too
much, and are inclined to send essays instead of para-
graphs W.H.D. : Will consider F. 5.11. : Handling
indifferent, and idea been used before W.J. : Not de-
void of strength, but situation well-worn and workman-
ship rough H.F.H. : Well enough written, and touch
ot power at end, but, on the whole, too much out of Bul-
letins tine Gob.: “Poets’ Fate” was not W.P.B.
without some hesitation. Best of yours we’ve seen.
>i Beflection bo ° fai . nt B-M. •' Gleam of humor in
bandy, but otherwise not up. Will consider
you send M.E.L. ; Too loose in joints and faint
ot interest You haven’t style enough to dispense
with story. ..The Rover : You have a comic sense, and
a rii ® , k . nack ’ but lack Practice J.E.D. : Grease
a little- tluck, ain’t it? P.T.F. : Astronomy weak;
earths always lit-up one side Wap-Wo: We spell it
Waj r ! VI oh . ” La!a F. (London): Grief accepted—
and no coolness bet ween us Henry F. (Orange) :
Printed in Bulletin years ago .... Jeb. : That alleged"
story of A. G. Taylor on sentry-duty and the Governor is
an adaptation of the old yarn about Gov. Macquarie and
the bullock-driver R.G. : Worse than baa news
Dea : Should be a vacancy for another sentimentalist
ad that charming sentiment is running to waste. ..
L.M.D. : “Jester” very stiff and solemn .. Go-bung:
btill gone Nerang Minstrel :No fear, you’re the orphan
boy that carries the harp A.F.B. :" “ Oh, wilt thou
yield that heart to me ?” —‘ ‘ those eyes ” —“ those lips ”
those arms.” After the arms the deluge, presumably....
MAY. : Better now—thought a comet hit us Muriel :
‘Come, my children, come and list yt, To the tale of
Wanganui.” Then we singularly missed ve, Couldn’t
find ye within cooey St. Ives: Faultlessly dull
Bacon 11. ; You’re quite right. Directly you find yourself
skipping a column write and tell us. We’re very ’umble.
.... Aylwin : Not quite force enough .... E.M. (Q.): Have
written you McG. :“ Torture ” goes J.T. (Harriet):
Pretty, but a little weak A.G.W. : “Fare” pun too
aged H.M. : Latham, the naturalist, was the first to
find (scientifically) the ,Aust. brush turkey, which he
named and described as a vulture ! Gould, when be saw
the type, set aside Latham's description, and, to take the
sting out of the knock, gave the bird the specific name of
lathami.' As the vulture family is absolutely unrepre-
sented in Australia, Latham's blunder seems all the
greater S.J.H. (W.A.): Thanks, but it was incidentally
alluded to here some time ago.

TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC) COTRIBUTORS.
H.W.C. : The sketches show some artistic feel-
ing, but they contain nothing to mark them as original.
W.G. (Bris.) :As suggestion, perhaps Walter B. :
Ditto C.W. : Bulletin doesn’t hanker after sketches
of the sort which might just as easily appear in Bits or
Flashes or Scraps ; and be published in London, or
Nova Zembla, or anywhere else. It wants subjects of
specially-Australian interest. All-Australian-interest is
the only excuse for this paper’s existence. It can’t and
doesn’t pretend to compete with the massofimported news-
paper-literature and sketches on the latter’s own ground.
; E.M.T. : Will submit to artist W. Lynch : A good
subject, but your sketch is not directly reproducible
Carl G. : None attractive M.T. : Most of them far too
wooden for direct reproduction Unavailable :—Coun-
try Cousin,D.O.C., Jack I. (Shep.), Peter Thur. (Melb.),
T.S. (Dub.), D. Bon. (D.), Adlih F.K.S. : One may
serve.
The Commercial World (London) writes re-
garding the Colonial Mutual Life Assurance Society
“ We always confidently anticipate a good year from' this
vigorously-conducted Mutual Society. The circumstance
therefore, that the figures for 1897 show no falling away
from the steady and substantial progress which is inse-
parably connected with the Society’s past career occasions
us no surprise. As a matter of fact, the Society earns its
success hy deserving it, and, that much being conceded
the best possible has been said for the continuance of the
large measure of public support which it has hillierto
fallen to its fortunate lot to receive.” Pleasant reading,*
Federation—yes or no Has Germany to
have Samoa with Mataafa as king—or shall we
Federate with America? Malietoa Tanu would
be happy if he knew a shipment of “Zetz” Spa
Water has been specially ordered for the fleet—
who all say “ Zetz ” is the correct water to mix
with any stimulant, or drink by itself. “Zetz”
kills uric acid, aids digestion, and is nature’s
true regulator. The password for good health is
“ Zetz.” Plump for “ Zets.”*

[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
When you first come to the city
With a seething rural brain,
And are just a little witty,
And, though verdant, not too vain—
You will meet a jovial fellow,
With a beaming smile and bland,
Who will state, in accents mellow,
That he’s proud to shake your hand.
He will ask you, then, to test
Any drink you fancy best,
/Lnd if times are very flush with him he ll ti eat you
to champagne.
He will fill you, good and square,
To the tap-roots of your hair—
For a free arid festive soul is Mr. Fillemupagam.
He will stand in pose dramatio,
Like a histrionic star,
And remark in tones emphatic.
Which will echo through the bar,
That he’s read your Book of Verses,
Which he knows will bring you fame . . .
You’ll imbibe your drink with curses,
But you’ll listen all the same.
You will see him everywhere.
He has always time to spare.
You will meet him on the Block, and in the most
secluded lane.
You are bound to strike him, too,
At each musical shivoo —
For a plentiful old bird is Mr. Fillemup again.
Grown familiar then, and bolder,
He will talk till all is blue ;
And, while weeping on your shouldir,
He will quote your verse to you ;
Till you wish that ere you’d written
Rhymes, in idle moments bred,
You had been by someone smitten
With a hammer on the head.
But he doesn't care a rap,
And he calls you “ Dear old chap !
And defies the crowd to name a Bard, in colored
print or plain,
Who is fit to lace the shoes
Of your shovel-footed Muse—
Oh, a gushing, slushing friend is Mr. Fillemup-
again!
Young Bush Genius, pray take warning,
And, when you behold him—flee !
If you do not, some fine morning,
On the road to Waverley,
He will —when your hearse draws level
With his pub,—say, with a wink,
“Yes, I knew him well, poor devil :
He destroyed himself with drink. ”
He admires your writings much ;
And your fine poetic touch
Makes the Toohey tears run down his nose in senti-
mental rain ;
But when cold you lie and dumb,
He will say you wrote on Rum,
For a Fiend disguised in Fat is Mr. Fillemup-
again.

Chased by the Enemy.
Few items are so thoroughly appreciated by the
reading public as accounts of triumph of the weak
over the enemy, especially if the one attacked is
innocent and not knowingly guilty of giving
reasonable cause of offence.
Mrs. Strange, Nairne, S.A., was recently at-
tacked in a ruthless mariner by liver disease, and
she quickly drove out the enemy by using War-
ner’s Safe Cure. It always drives away bilious-
ness, and gives renewed vigor and strength to the
kidneys—and did in this instance. She says:
“Having suffered for some time with debility
and liver complaint, which so reduced my
strength as to render me unfit for anything, and.
the doctor's skill failing to give me relief, I took
four bottles of Warner’s Safe Cure, with the result
that lam perfectly cured. Although 60 years o l
age, I am now strong and well again.’’*

POLITICAL
POINTS
Memo., for that Sydney daily paper: Liars
need good memories.
The miners must gain as consumers
under this Bill.” Unexpected truth in Sydney
Telegraph of Ist June, 1899.
n GS ’ , w hat is federally the matter with
Crick who could influence hundreds of votes, but
publicly says never a syllable on the subject ?
The long-lived Braddon (Tas.) Ministry
has at last to face a censure-motion that looks
serious. Old low-spirited Stafford B. Bird, the
man with the perpetual grievance, is reaching out
for a turn at the cash-box
Tas. Parliament opened May 30. A
Govt. Bill to provide for the restoration of the for-
feited rights of a private syndicate (Great Western
Cndiron co.) will be the first measure dealt with
Socialism in our time! ” O Lord !
The anti-Federalists made a big tactical
blunder in having the N.S.W. referendum post-
poned for two months after the passing of the
Enabling Bill. Their stock of perjuries has failed
to hold out, and they have now almost lied them-
selves to a standstill.
Hunk of eloquence from leading Brisbane
anti-Federal organ :—“ Fellow electors.—By every
sign of industry on your horny hands and sun-
burnt brows ; as you love liberty and pray for
peace ; by the ashes of your fathers and the
temples of your gods, do not sell your liberty and
your country by accepting this proposed Conven-
tion Bill.” How’s that !
John Haynes, William Hughes, and such
like F ederalists (?) have not enough brass to call
tor cheers for “Australia” at the termination of
their meetings, as the Billites do, but instead call
tor cheers for “Democracy.” Even this ceremony
is omitted when Pilcher, Heydon,or MacLaurin is
on the platform with them. The conscience of
even an anti-billite draws the line somewhere.
Caldwell, M.P., one of the numerous
leaders of S. A. Opposition, went to Woodside a
small country town, the other day to harangue
the electors on the iniquities of the Kingston
Govt. Fourteen people turned up, and Caldwell
,n j 6 s P ace °f three hours, annihilated Kingston
and a “ his works. By the time his speech had
finished five electors had disappeared, and the
remainder unanimously affirmed their confidence
in the Govt.
THE MIS-REPRESENTATIVE OR DISUNITED TEAM. The above have chosen to mierepresent N.S.W. on behalf of the Little Auebra-
lians against United Australia in the test-match on June 20.
The Dickson Govt, has already dis-
tinguished itself by some of the most flagrant acts
of nepotism ever recorded in Bananaland. As a
counterblast, however, Oily Jimmy has caused a
circular to be issued to civil-servants warning
them that any attempt to influence departmental
administration per medium of politicians will be
severely dealt with. And the civil-service puts
its fingers to its nose respectfully.
In its tedious “Witness-Box,” Sydney
D.T. went out of its way to resurrect Premier
Reid’s decade-old declaration, “I may perhaps
sit on a rail some day.” But the Telegraph was
just a year too late. Reid sat on the rail when
meditating his jump to the anti-Bill side, but he
had no hesitation in getting to the other side of
the fence from bravv Dr. MacLaurin and the in-
effectual Rosa, and the melancholy Heydons and
’bus-boss C.irey, and I. Reginald Cohen and Kohen
with a “K.,” and the rest of that “multy”
gang.
Lyne has repeated his last year’s trick of
keeping a dead silence till a week or two before
the referendum, and then flinging his wooden
oratory at the head of the devoted Bill. The idea
was, apparently, to work up the public to a fever
of anxiety as to the long, sad spook’s sentiments.
But the public didn’t work up, because it didn’t
care a straw what its depressed back-number
thought either way. The idea of carefully saving
ip Lyne for a final effort was very like investing
. penny in 3 per cent. Govt, securities against
ne’s old age.
The MacLaurin-Tommy Dodd push who
argue that N.S.W. will be so uninfluential in the
Federal Parliament that the “wolves” will do
what they like with her, maintain in the next
breath that Reid, Barton, Wise, O’Connor and
other N.S.W. billites fight for Federation because
they know they will pull off the highest offices in
the Commonwealth. Surely the State that is able
to gobble up the Premiership, Chief-Justiceship,
Attorney-Generalship, Speakership, and soon, in
the Commonwealth, is well able to hold its own in
other respects.
Jack Want is now reported as due in
Sydney on 16th June. So there will just be time
before the Referendum for him to produce that
famous F ederation Bill which was to satisfy all the
provinces, and which Disunion Jack said, shortly
before the ’9B Referendum, he could and would
draw up in half-an-hour as soon as the old
m mC TVT k a y Ar* low ”■ lX as out . of the way. So far, all
, 6 N.S. W. anti-Federalists swear that they are
longing for Federation, and that they only want
a fair and honest Bill, and they know exactly
what kind of Bill that is —but they never produce
r : Federation going strong on the
N.S.W. Northern rivers, despite the croakers
who predict the destruction of the sugar industry.
If Premier Reid would promise to set about the
erection of central State mills, similar to those
in Queensland, to enable N.S.W. growers to com-
pete with the Northern province on equal terms
under Federation, there would be no opposition
to the Bill worth speaking of. Growers would
welcome Federation as a means of escaping from
the monopoly held by the Col. S. Refining Co.,
which is now in a position to dictate terms to
growers.
Sydney D.T. declares that the Sydney
public, servants, when listening to Barton and
Wise on the Commonwealth Bill, were quite cool
and unenthusiastic. In the mass, the service (or
such of it as gathered together at that meeting)
looks shabby, badly-fed and dispirited. You
could hardly imagine such people being demonstra-
tive under any circumstances—to say nothing of
that particular occasion, when they assembled
under the eye of the Public Service Board. The:
N.S.W. civil service doesn’t dare to call its soul
its own ; not one per cent, of it is game to speak
to itself in tones'above a whisper.
M.E. Tory party is trying to catch Demo-
cratic votes by promising, when it gets into power,
to create an elective Upper House instead of the
present Council of 7-year nominees. But on what
basis is it to be elected ? Victoria, for instance,
has an elective Upper House, where only rich
landlords are, eligible for membership, and they
are elected by property-holders only—an unpaid
House which can’t be dissolved or swamped, or
controlled in any way. An elective Upper House
is excellent if, like the proposed Federal Senate,
it is elected in the right way. One elected in the
wrong way may be an immoveable curse.
Perth Morning Herald, which calls with
a melancholy voice every day up and down the
smellful, dog-infested streets of Perth in the
parochial interest, keeps telling the same tale all
the year round—that Federation will reduce the
customs revenue, and W. A. has no other possible
source of revenue. W.A. has no land or income
tax, or probate duty, or excise, and it could
abolish its free newspaper postage, and tax its
absentee gold-mining companies on their output,
and levy a totalisator tax, and a“! poll-tax on
Asiatics, and a few other trifles. The alleged lion
in the path is only a stuffed ass after all.
Sydney public servants, with many secret
misgivings, have practically decided to form an
association and have called a meeting to that end
for June 9. Fear of the Board has prevented a
great many frorn joining at present. For instance,
not one in the Chief Secretary’s office was brave
enough to put his name on the provisional
committee, because the Board might not like
, ■ both . tbe Premier and the Board have
pubnely complained of the non-existence of such
a as P* l *^ o Service Association, which
would be we.c-omed as a means of gauging the
general wishes of the civil service instead of
having to deal piecemeal with conflicting interests
“ Ugh ” Nelson :
J wanted to convince the people of Queensland against
the l l ederal Constitution, the most effective course would
ne to republish and circulate among the people who were
Wales ° rof lt the arffuments used in its favor in N.S.
And if ex-Premier Nelson wants to persuade the
people of Queensland to support the proposed
Federal Constitution, the best thing he can do is
to keep on barracking vigorously against it,
assisted by his old crony, A. H. Barlow—the gen-
tleman who helped him to certify that the Q.N.
Bank was resting on the rock of financial recti-
tude.
‘ Michael Bourke ” writes from Queens-
land to say that John Norton told his Brisbane
audience these two things : that the Federal Con-
stitution does not provide for the abolition of
plural voting, and that it does not guarantee to
abolish the colored mongrel. Michael is hereby in-
THE TEAMS FOR THE FORTHCOMING TEST-MATCHES.
THE REPRESENTATIVE OR UNITED AUSTRALIAN TEAM. —The above have been chosen to represent United Australia in the forth-
coming test-matches—the first of which takes place in N.S.W. on June 20.
formed: In clauseB the amended Bill providesFhat
in Federal Senate elections no man shall have more
than one vote. In clause 30 it provides that in
Federal Lower House elections no man shall have
more than one vote. And in clause 51, sections
26 and 27, it provides that this manhood-suffrage-
elected Federal Parliament shall have power to
deal with any alien race in any way it thinks best.
If it doesn’t deal with it in the right way, then
the workers of Australia will have themselves to
blame.
Apropos the boiler-explosion on a little
Sydney steam-launch, which wrecked the launch
and another. W. D. Cruickshank, engineer-sur-
veyor of N.S.W. Marine Board, to an inter-
viewer :
Then there are a number of vessels now running in Syd-
ney Harbor that have no certificates?
That is quite correct. A number of vessels, run-
ning on the coast, and also some harbor and river
steamers, have no certificates from the Marine Board.
There is no law in this colony to compel them to have one.
And last-session’s Navigation Amending Act,
which would have made boiler-inspection com pul-
sory, rotted away in the Leg. Council, where the
anti-Federationists come from.
The curse of anti-Billious Brown, M.L.O. :
Federation should be worked for by men chosen from
among the people by the people themselves, and conse-
crated to the object of its consummation.
Well, the people did choose the men in question
at the Convention election. And among the lot
were Barton, Wise, Reid, “ Dick ” O’Connor, and
every prominent man that Repudiation Brown is
now cursing at. But the people didn’t choose
Brown. By Brown’s own showing he is an inter-
loper with no commission from the people at all.
Brown, by the way, is the wild, weird person who
says he “ defies anybody to prove that the Bill
will give intercolonial Freetrade.” As the Bill
says absolutely that there shall be intercolonial
Freetrade, the inference is that poor old Repudia-
tion Brown can’t read.
The people of Gloucester, Parry, and
B and counties (N.S.W.) are asking Govt,
to cu> something to shift the dead weight of that
English absentee corporation, the Australian
Agricultural Co. Said co. owns half Parry county,
one-fourth of Gloucester, and one-sixth of Buck-
land (about 1,250,000 acres), also splendid coal
mines. It has owned them for 70 years, and it
never paid N.S.W. a single copper for them. If
N.S.W. had been blessed with a democratic
Government, a heavily-graduated land-tax would
have broken up this bulky monopoly long ago,
but the N.S.W. land-tax, which falls almost
equally on the rich landholder and the compara-
tively poor one, is a mere revenue-raising device,
and doesn’t move the big monopolist an inch.
Every day the Sydney parochial organ
quotes in large type the alleged answer of Tas-
manian ex-Treasurer Fysh:—
They (the N.S.W. delegates) would be only 24 out ol
the whole Federal representatives. There would be an
immense voting majority to secure the solvency of the
other States.
This is said to be something dark and sinister and
an awful murky reason why N.S.W. shouldn’t
federate. Yet if the idea is that N.S.W.’s
1,300,000 people should constitute a voting
majority against the other provinces’ 2,300,000, or ’
that the only proper Federation is one where
things are so fixed that all the States except
N.S.W. are insolvent, it is a pity that the matter
isn’t explained right off.
Cabled that Joubert, Boer Commander-in-
Chief, has stated that, for his part, he is in favor
of granting the franchise to all Uitlanders who,
after four years’ residence in the Transvaal, are
prepared to swear that they will fight to preserve
its independence. Well, that’s a fair bargain.
The price of liberty—readiness to fight.
At the meeting recently held in Sydney to
sympathise with theoppressed Outlanders ” one
grievance alleged was that “a man could not
carry a gun ” in the Transvaal, without special
permission. A man can’t carry a gun in England
either without special permission, which costs 10s.
annually. Also,, you can’t keep a man-servant or
a carriage in England without paying a license
fee, and you have to pay a heavy tax for painting
a griffin or some other like beast on your carriage-
door. If you' keep an eating-house without paying
for special permission the law gives you particular
beans, andif. you sell silver-plate or dead rabbits
without paying for special permission you get into
great trouble. Even churches have to be licensed.
What about a meeting on behalf of the oppressed
British in England ?

, As j® ijsual in England, and unusual in Aus-
traha, the Derby fell to a warm first favorite. The time
(2min. 42 4-ssec.) was quite as good as V.R.C. Derby time
considering that the Epsom course is not all on the level,
and the start is clocked from the jump, and there were a
dozen horses in the field-but the favorite didn’t get
interfered with. The British punter gets a fair run and
almost invariably a win for his money when he lays odds
on a Derby horse, whereas the Australian believer in
dead-birds sees an Aurnm blocked and cannoned
against in a field of six, or a Bobadil beaten allegedly
through bad judgment of the jockey. p
Yankee jockey Tod Sloan’s mount stumbled in
the English Derby race, and Sloan, perched upon the
nag s withers, couldn’t stop it from falling. The common
prediction that Sloan would be unable to keep a stumbling
animal on its legs, had a sensational fulfilment. He rode
the French candidate, Holocauste ; the fall broke one of
its pasterns, and it was duly pole-axed on the course. So
u 6 'Ji 0 j nseers return home with a poor opinion of
the Tod Sloan tactics. “Ze ’Mericain jock ee ride
like zis, in a fooleesh raannaire,” as the Franeo-Dutch
lady m “ The Belle of New York” would remark.
It would probably have gone hard with Tod
Sloan if he had been riding Wait-a-Bit in last Australian
Cup. The Ballarat horse, like Holocauste at Epsom, was
afc the head of the field until the favorite caught and
passedl hrm. Then, in making- a desperate effort to re-
cover his lost place, Wait-a-Bait stumbled badlv and was
ilmost down when Paddy Guinane, with a mighty pull,
prevented a catastrophe. *

Newhaven must be galloping in something like
his old Australian form. Although he had but one horse
to meet in Epsom Cup, Jaquemart, that one was more
formidable than a big- field of outsiders. Jaquemart last
season bad three good wins—the Queen’s Prize at Kemp-
ton Park, the Newmarket Handicap and the Ascot Royal
Hunt Cup, in which race he beat several notable English
horses.

John Finnic, of Drayton (Q.), bred a smart two-
year-old in Sweetheart, which won Q.T.C. Stradbroke
six furlongs, with Bst. 13!b. up, in 1.15%. Though Farm
times are unreliable, still, with Lauri (Bst. 91b.) beaten
haif-a-furlong, the form makes Sweetheart look equal to
the smartest of Southern youngsters. She is a nicely-
shaped yellow chestnut, and gets away from the barrier
like a flash. T. G. Muir has since bought her at 500
guineas for England, where Coronation, another Q. two-
year-old champion, already is.

“ S'Hy Billy Re par. (6/5/’99) as to the “New-
castle ” imported sire Metal being well up in the winning-
stallion list. How does he come to be a Newcastle sire?
Metal was imported by Mr. C. Baldwin, of Durham Court,
Manilla, near Taniworth, and sold by him to Mr. Gozo
Smith, of Tucka Tucka, where he now is. Metal’s stock
have for years been racing in Sydney, and have been at
least fairly successful. A few of them : Telegraoh has
won numerous races round Sydney ; Tubal Cain 11. won
a race at each of the lust two A. J.C. meetings ; Fauna was
winner of High-Weight Handicap last A.J.C. ; Silence has
won in Sydney, and has taken five races during the last
few weeks at Forbes, Grenfell, and Murrumbidgee; Car-
rara won four or five races in Sydney, and ran third in
last Newmarket; Metallic, bought by ltupert Clarke, of
Victoria, for 500 guineas, is, I am almost sure, another,
and there are many more.

Justice Cohen’s decision that a public “ horse-
race" is a dangerous performance or exhibiiion, within
the meaning of N.S.VV. Children’s Protection Act, will, it
is expected, effectually ch.eck the practice of employing
child-jockeys, as, under the section, an injured lad can
easily obtain compensation from his employer for any ac-
cident resulting from his engagement.

Mr. Geo. Gray, of Westralia fame, has -finally
decided to give up racing, and all his stud is to'be sold
without reserve on July 7. There should be exciting
bidding for the well-performed Chesney (Malua—Madcap)
who will probably turn out champion three-year-old of
next season. The hitherto very-disappointing George
Frederick (Carbine—Danae) should also be worth buying.
. The test-match, England v. Australia, resulted
in a draw. It was t.h6 best the Englishmen had to
hope for when they started on the 3J4 hours available for
their second innings, and out of the 155 which they got
for 7 wickets 93 were credited to Ranjitsinhji. The total
scores were—Australia, Ist innings, 252 (with Hill, 62 •
Gregory, 48 ; Darling, 47 ; and Noble, 41). 2nd innings!
230 (with Hill, 80 ; and Noble, 45). England, l9t innings,
193 (with Fry, 50 ; and Ranjitsinhji, 42). 2nd innnings,
as above, Hayward, with 28, coming second to Ranji’s
big figure. Hill and Ranjitsinhji thus contributed to
their sides 132 and 13" respectively.

The Australians almost deserved to lose the
first Test-match, instead of having it drawn in their
favor. With the luck of the toss, they pottered about
the livelong day, on a batsmen’s wicket, for the paltry
score of 238. Considering the length of the English
cricket day this is tamer than the tamest performance of
Stoddart’s last team in Australia.
* * » *
It is characteristic of the conservatism of the
Marylebone Club that no Essex man has ever been
selected to play for All-England against the Australians,
although the visitors have been troubled by the Essex
bowlers. Meade, for instance, has made good averages
against three or four successive Australian teams, and
last month the County beat Australia on the strength of
a big performance by a young sailor-man bowler. Why
wasn't that left-handed sailor-man chosen for All-
England instead of stodgy Hirst?
* * * •
Darling’s friends told him, on the eve of his
departure with the present team, that the captaincy and
the financial worry would kill his batting. Up to the
commencement of the test the prophecy had come out
remarkably correct, as Joe was third from bottom with an
average of 15.
* * • •
Oxford University’s batting against the Aus-
tralians makes “ test” cricket look rather foolish. Here
were 10 young amateurs, on the second dav of the match,
slogging 305 runs in such quick time that the Australians,
for their part, could make 110 for 2 wickets ere the draw-
ing of stumps -a total of 415 runs for the day. Cricket is
indeed a boys’ game. The average age of the Oxonians
would be not more than 21, and yet, when it comes to
choosing an all-England Eleven, the preference is given to
a lot of old stayers whose years average a trifle more than
31 per man. And this, after all, is only two years older
than the average Australian representative.

“The Inns of Court Hotel, the new London
home of the Australian cricketers,” writes The Bulletin’s
London correspondent, “runs from High Holborn through
to Lineal ns-Inn-Fields, where Lord William Russell was
beheaded. It is a splendid up-to-date hotel, far superior
to the former rendezvous, the ‘ Tavistock,’ in the dirty
purlieus of Covent Garden, and run by Frank Blackley,
who has seen enough of Australia to be a product, if he
isn’t. The contingent are arriving in dribbles via Paris
and Plymouth, and only Darling, Gregory, Kelly, Hill,
Jones and Johns have come to hand safely up to now.
They are all in splendid condition, and certainly such a
team of Prussian-blue-rihboners. according to accounts of
the voyage, never left the Land of Thirst-Engendering.
And it is well, for the Lords of Cricket here are, p’raps for
the first time, seriously alarmed, and intend to give no
quarter or ‘ trials.' As Capt. Darling is shaping remark-
ably well; but oh ! for ‘ Trotty ’to ‘ toss the eoin ' and
phlegmatically work his wily ‘nut.’ The team begin
practice next vveek (May Ist),” continues our correspon-
dent, “and may play a match against Lord Wilton’s XI.
on the 4th ; but, anyhow, Grace’s team have to be met on
Bth, and sea-legs sometimes take a lot of relaxing. The
Crystal Palace ground is one of the most picturesque in
the world, and, under W. G.’s management, the pitch is
said to have wonderfully improved. It will need to, for
in ’96, v. De Trafford’s team, it was very anyhow. There
is a bit of a run on the dark green and old gold already,
and we may expect, if the team be victorious, a lot of be-
ribboned bounders patronising, or wanting to, ‘Clem,’
‘Joe,’ ‘Hughie,’ &c., and posing as ‘ Hostralians,’ bai

a bare second by James M‘Kay in an underhand wood-

world’s record, best previous being lmin. 28seo. by Pet-
titt, in Tasmania, early this year. The men subsequently
met in the champion chop (2ft. blocks) for £l5 and Aus-

Some good Rugby was shown in Sydney foot-
ball on Saturday, considering that it took the players
most of their time to avoid getting bogged. Wallaroo
downed University by 19 points to 3, after a very open
game—’Varsity battling against much bad luck ; whilst
Marrickville helped themselves to a win at the expense of
Pirates ; and Randwick beat the persevering Parramatta
team by 14 to 3. On the Cricket Ground, Sydney and
Buccaneer slithered and scrambled for some hours the
democratic “Bucks” finishing up 8 points to the bad.
Two Sydney players and one “ Buck ” were ordered off
the ground for misconduct. In the case of the latter, the
“ ordering off ’’ appeared superfluous, as the player had
to be gathered up and carted to hospital.

White Cliffs, the N.S.W. opal - mining
centre, is a great gathering-place of irreeoncil-
ables. Just when it was being opened up, the 6.
shearers and the Barrier miners’ strikes threw
many men out of billets and left some with very
little immediate hope of recovering them ; so there
was a flocking to the opal-fields, where men could
gouge —the local equivalent for fossick—“on
their own. Naturally, these men found in
oleath, just out of gaol as a strike “conspirator,”
an M.P. after their own hearts; and now his
advocacy of the Federal Bill has struck them
a hard knock, for their man must be ag’in
everything. Hence the decision of the local Poli-
tical Labor League that any Labor M.P. favoring
the Rill is a deep-dyed traitor unworthy of sup-
fi? rt b r t ’ lS i- tlie case with m ost branches of
the Jr.L.L., the few most ferocious irreconcilables

“ Sabre ” on certain military matters •
If Lord Beauchamp wasn’t too busy sticking to the pig-
skin and getting photo’d, at Sydney Queen’s Birthday
’ he have £ oC much quiet enjoyment out of
ffie show’ which was about the most deplorable exhibition
N.S W s soldiers have yet made of themselves. Lined up
carefully before H. Ex. arrived, they looked a noble lot—
at a distance ; but chaos began with the marching. The
Marines marched past fairiy, but the partially-paid men
and gorgeously-arrayed Volunteers proved ’themselves
quite innocent of any charge of being able to drill
Their distances were all wrong, lines crooked, and odd
men were even unable to keep step. The performance of
the Lancers would drive any “ soldier” to drink. After
marching past at a walk, badly, and doing the trot past
whfnh y t a u a C i anter ’ t - he i V lined U P for th ® gallop past,
which they also carried out at a slow canter. Thev
gave onlookers, however, a fair representation of
cavalry in battle : front-rank men got behind
rear-line men got in front, and both, with officers, got
jumbled up m the middle batch, whilst the command-
ing officer charged wildly and passed the Gov. with a
strong lead of 20 lengths. Now, whose fault is it that
regiments which have been formed for years past fail to
master the most elementary principles of drill, and are
unable to do, with paid instructors, what most schoolboys
learn in a week, viz., to keep step and maintain a decent
dressing ? If the public wasn't too tired it would see that
every member of said regiments attended drills and
generally did a little more than swagger about in gaudv
trappings; likewise it would reckon it time enough to
seno men ’Oine for training when they had learnt all they
could here. Furthermore, it would insist that all officers
who appeared on parade astride the mokes which some of
them ride at present, should be taken out and shot with-
out mercy.
To Labor Members in General.
For two reasons the Labor-party needs Federa-
tion more than any other party does. (1) The
State Parliaments will still have most of what
is generally called social legislation to deal with,
and that is the sort of legislation with which
the Labor-party’s policy is packed. But, being
relieved of Australian national questions’ these
State Parliaments will have more time to deal
with those social questions. Talk-outs kill
most proposed social reforms ; and, with fewer
subjects to .handle, the likelihood of talk-outs
will be less. The franchise and electoral ar-
rangements for the State Houses are not touched
by the Bill; so that, from the point of view
ot getting social reforms more quickly the
Labor-party has all to gain by voting’Yes.
(2) So far as the State Parliaments are
concerned, Federation will slay the fiscal
issue and bury it under the Constitution
lhe Labor-party in N.S.W. started off in 1891
with 35 members ; but, even with the en-
thusiasm for the “new force ” on them, a big
bunch couldn’t sink the fiscal issue at the first
trial, and since then others, one by one, have
fallen off the plank, one side or the other.
Just at present, in fact, there are grave doubts
whether any are left on the plank at all; for
the party is practically bound to Reid and Free-
trade. Yet all the strength of a third party
lies in its independence ; if it isn’t as ready to
go with one as t’other its special power is gone.
Fiscalistn is a standing peril to a Labor man or
a Labor electorate; only just here and there
can you strike one who, being a freetrader, can
enthusiastically support protection year after
year ; or vice versa. Also, loaves and fishes are
as precious in politics as elsewhere—on the
whole, more precious. But while fiscalisin
divides the main parties the only chance
that a member of a third party has
ot any morsel is Buckley's. So, if he is
at all inclined that way (and the glitter of the
Ministerial office counts as well as the pay), his
only chance is to do as Joe Cook did—go
over, and take his constituency with him.
Finally, fiscalism stands in the way of some
constituencies which ought to be Labor, return-
ing Labor men. Constituencies like loaves and
fishes, too ; and what is the chance of the man
who is always in a minority getting a bridge
over Dead Dog Creek—compared, anyway,
with a Ministerialist’s chances? That which
kept a Labor-party out of existence in N.S.W.
for years; that which gave it its first set-back
after it was born ; and that which has kept it
insignificant in numbers ever since is the very
thing which Federation will put out of the way.
For this further reason, then, nothing could suit
the Labor-party’s book better than Federation.
Touching the Mansfield (Vic.) mystery.
When the furniture and effects of the late old
man Butler were taken over by the local auctioneer
for sale, thirty-two shillings were found in a
parcel secured to the bedstead with a saddle-strap.
To the eye of the auctioneer’s man it was about
the first thing noticeable on entering the room,
w^jC -r\ ex^a ' ns the police and ’tecs Burvett
and Dungey had overlooked it. The obvious is
seldom perceived by a detective—off the stage.
Poor old Dibbs has a curious way of flying
off the handle. He starts a speech by objecting
to equal State representation in the Senate—that
arrangement by vvhich N.S. W. and Victoria, the
two large-population States, give a certain conces-
sion to the four States of small population. Then
he in variably rushes on to curse, not Queensland
and W.A. and S.A., which gain by equal State
representation, but A ictoria, which loses by it
almost exactly as much as N.S. W. does, and
which never really wanted equal State representa-
tion for that reason. To the mean, grudging souls
of the old Dibbs and Want crowd there is only
one enemy in the world, and that is the Victorian
capital which committed the unpardonable sin of
growing to be a bigger city than Sydney. And no
matter on what subject Dibbs and co. start speak-
mg they have to stop and curse Victoria every
now and then by way of refreshment.
Barrister Gregory, who for years has
been shut up in Kew Asylum, set the suck-
ing lawyers who frequent Vic. Practice Court a
lesson in lucffi reasoning recently. Gregory was
Registrar of Friendly Societies, and lecturer on
property-law at the University for years. One
day, so it is alleged, he was seized with hallucina-
tions, and several doctors certified to his insanity.
Among other things, it was said, he believed
people wanted to rob him of his documents ; that
he barred and bolted his house till his wife became
afraid to stay in the same room with him, and that
he believed lie was being drugged. At any rate,
he was put in the asylum, and his appearance
before the court arose out of a big effort on his
part to get out. For two hours this alleged
lunatic argued his case with a force and sound-
ness rarely exhibited in the Vic. courts. He
urged that when a man was going about his ordi-
nary work, taking care of his property, managing
his affairs, conducting public business—all of
which it was admitted he was doing up to the
very day of his committal—a mere medical certifi-
cate that he was insane was not sufficient to keep
him in a lunatic asylum all his days. He ad-
mitted having had a quarrel with his wife, but
properly pointed out that she had her remedy at
law other than by having him committed to a
lunatic-asylum. She could have obtained a judi-
cial separation. Justice Williams was against
Gregory right through, and after five hours’ argu-
ment simply said he could not go in the face of
the medical evidence.

A bit from anti-Federal Cotton, of N.S. W.:
The very star’s in their courses, he says, seem to be
against the Bill. The prolonged drought, the harrowing
distress, the terrible pictures of heart-rending desolation
that cover the western plains, etc., etc. In a stretch of
country where the river bed is just dotted with stagnant
waterholes, where desperate efforts are being made to
keep only a proportion of the sheep alive, and where the
smaller settlers, harassed by four years of dry seasons,
are facing the blank prospect of ruin if rain does not
come, etc., etc. The meaning of the settlement of the
rivers question as provided in the Secret Conference Bill
has been brought home with speoial force to the settlers
on the western rivers.
According to Cotton, Caere are no rivers left in
the awful west —only mud-holes and dust and
dead cattle. And the people have awakened to
the terrible danger of losing complete control of
the rivers—which there aren’t any.

Will Ogilvie’a book of verses, “ Fair Girls
and Gray Horses,” continues to sell splendidly. It
is unquestionably the most generally-attractive
poetry-book yet issued in Australia. Price, 4s. 6d.,
post-free from Bulletin office.
In connection with the recent acquittal of
the voting man Price, charged with shooting his
brother-in-law, aN.S.W. clergyman, The Bulle-
tin has strong reason to believe that practical jus-
tice was done in the matter by Judge and jury, and
is further glad to know that Price, who bears an
honorable and most manly reputation, is still so
highly thought of by his Adelaide employers that
they have invited him to return to his post in their
service.
Barton made one point at his recent civil
servants’ meeting which impressed his audience
greatly. He pointed out that the two-headed
anti-Federal party shouted, with one head, about
how the cost of the Post and Telegraph and other
transferred services would be increased to a fearful
extent under Federation. And the other head
yelled that the salaries of the public servants in
these same departments would be cut down by the
Federal Govt, in its frantic desire to reduce the
cost of the same services. Therefore, the general
public should vote against the Bill because of the
great increase in the cost of the services where the
expense is to be cut down, and civil servants
should vote against it on account of the great re-
duction in the cost of the services where the ex-
pense is to go up.
Two almost consecutive sentences from the
anti-Federal address of Alex. Brown, Tory
M.L.C., at Newcastle (N.S.W.):
The Braddon blot was legalised robbery. He knew of
no other place in the world where the Gov't, raised four
times more revenue than was wanted. ... If people
thought they were going to get their money back when
once it got into the Federal Treasurer’s hands they had
less intelligence than he gave them credit for.
So, according to Debt Repudiation Brown, (1) the
Federal Govt, will raise four times the customs
revenue it personally requires because it has to
hand back three-fourths of it to the states to pay
interest on their public debts (Repudiation Brown
believes in simply not paying the interest). Also,
(2) in the same breath he says the Federal Govt.
won't hand the money back ; therefore it won’t
have to raise four times the revenue it personally
requires.
0. Gr. Heydon, that painfully bigoted law-
yer of N.S.W. Leg. Council, wrote to the Sydney
papers on May 30 to say that the N.S.W. people
should reject Federation because the Bill provides
for the Commonwealth being sole ground-landlord
of the 100 sq. miles of Federal territory on which
the capital is to stand. Naturally the Heydon
kind of man does curse. The idea of all the un-
earned increment going to the nation, and all the
rents of that great territory forming a splendid
income for the Commonwealth, instead of the land
being private property and the syndicate and
earth-grabber and lawyer getting the profit, is
enough to make any ghastly Tory like Heydon ex-
plode with fury. C. G. Heydon says that “ be-
neath the lowest depth a lower depth is to be
found ” —and the national ownership of that
Federal territory is the final abyss that Heydon
shudders over.
When N.S.W. Labor-party met for its
first caucus after the ’9l election there were present
Bavister, Black, Cann, Joe Cook, E. M. Clark,
G. D. Clark, Cotton, Danahey, Darnley, Davis,
Edden, Fegan, J. D. Fitzgerald, “Jupp ” Gardi-
ner, Gough, Hindle, Houghton, Hutchinson,
Hollis, Johnston, A. J. Kelly, Kirkpatrick, Mac-
kinnon, M‘Gowen, Morgan, Newman, Newton,
Nicholson, Rae, Scott, Sharp, Sheldon, Vaughan,
and Williams. Of those Cann, Edden, and
M'Gowen are the only three who now sit
as Labor members. Cook, Clark, Fegan,
Newman, and Nicholson are in the House,
but they belong to other parties; and fiscalisin
slaughtered the others. The Freetrade-Pro-
tection question is got rid of so far as local
politics are concerned by Federation ; and yet
some Labor-men are fighting Federation as an
enemy !
On two separate occasions the press has
reported Dr. MacLaurin as denying that he was a
member of the Dibbs Govt, which put on the
heavy N.S.W. tariff in 1891—MacLaurin’s atti-
tude now being that heavy tariffs are an un-
mitigated curse. Well, the fact that he ivas a
member of the Government which put on these
duties rests on the evidence of Hansard, the
Government Gazette, the newspaper Parlia-
mentary reports, the “ Handbook of Australia,”
the “ Australian Year-Book,” the Parliamentary
records, and about 120 dozen other publications.
He might not be a member at the exact time
when the Dibbs duties were put on, but he was a
member of the Govt, which put them on and
which kept them on. The Telegraph also repre-
sents him as denying that he has a large interest
in the Colonial Sugar Refining Co. Perhaps he
doesn’t call a few thousand pounds worth of shares
and a directorship a “ large ” interest.
“ Vinegar ” : The number of small men
marching in the Q. May Day Labor procession,
was remarkable. They walked anyhow, too,
smoking, paring nails, and dragging small sons
into line with them. The next generation,
smartened with daily physical drill in school
cadet companies, ought to show an advance in
physique and make future processions more like a
thing of beauty.

without it, and its general applicability to the
relief of a large number of simple ailments forms
its best recommendation.”

with Wounds that Discharge or otherwise, perhaps sur-
rounded with inflammation and swollen that when you
press your finger on the inflamed part it leaves the impres-

the remedies you have tried, which, if not extracted, you
never can recover, but go on suffering till death releases
you. Perhaps your knees are swollen, the joints being
ulcerated; the same with the ankles, round w r hichthe skin
may be discoloured, or there may be wounds ; the disease
if allowed to continue will deprive you of the power to
walk. You may have attended various hospitals and had

The District Registrar at aJN.S.W. up-
country town detected, a month or two ago, a
serious omission to register before him. He re-
ported the offence, and wrote to Sydney for per-
mission to prosecute. Permission was, of course,
given, and then the Department got a.wire from
the district clerk of petty sessions/fOr authority to
require the District Registrar to produce his
registers before the police magistrate. The humor
of the situation lies in the fact that the D.R.,
C.P.S., and P.M. are one and the same indi-
vidual !

Prof. Anderson Stuart’s turn for original
thinking has driven him to invent a plan whereby
Sydney University commemorations maybe made
less characteristic of the Zoo. at feed-time than is
ordinarily the case. The Professor would begin
the discipline a week before the event. On one
day he would have a tennis-match, next day a
boat-race, next a cricket-match, then a concert,
then a ball, and then the commem. The Pro-
fessor ai-gues in learned academic style that this
series of excitements would use up the animal
spirits of the youths so that they would come
chastened and subdued to the commemoration.
The dancing especially, he says, would take it
out of them. This is the professor who holds that
the calf of the leg is a sound index of mental
power.
“ Alba ” writes a one-act dog-drama :
Three houris run a seraglio in our street. Their dog—
a half-bred dingo—is called Yussuf. Yussef howls night
and day, because he is tormented by inner visions of a
dingo-pack which hunts sheep on the edge of the Never-
Never. Or, perhaps, it is the importance of being Yussuf
that affects his inside. Yussuf’s yearnings keep me
awake. There are two animals writer has condemned to
be judicially murdered —the fiend who reads Marie Corelli
aloud, and the casual Yussuf that won’t go to bed. Last
night, I baited a piece of tripe, and stole down to the
seraglio fence. Yussuf was considering a bone under the
lee of the kennel. A distant clock struck il; inciden-
tally, the bait fell like gentle tripe from heaven.
Yussuf sniffed suspiciously; his ears stiffened, but his
eyes were full of tender gratitude. He rose languidly,
and reached for the bait; I saw with pain that it
had fallen beyond his chain-reach. Yussuf looked up at
me reproachfully and lav down with his nose to the
ground. “ Fetch it, Y.ussy, fetch it!” I whispered. En-
couraged, he rose and put out a paw almost touching it.
A few more cheering words and he lay forward with his
weight on the chain : the kennel moved about the mil-
lionth part of an inch. Some more encouragement and
he strained with paws tearing- the earth, his tawny
hair bristling over his neck, his jowd adrip—it was a ter-
rific pull—and the kennel answered fully half an inch.
: Again he put out a paw, and the bait seemed to shiver,
so close was it. More cheering words and Yussuf let
himself go with the strength of 20 dogs, his red eyes
glowering at the tit-bit, his ribs pulsing with victorious
fury ; the kennel creaked and gave him an inch to spare.
The bait was at his paw and he took it—yes, he took it—
and I had several hours’ sleep. Yussuf has all time and
all eternity to sleep. Moral : Don’t persevere.

Mr. G. J. A. NIELSEN,
A Living Witness ot the virtues of the
Aifaline Herbal Remedies.
Kalgoorlie, September 12,1898.
to Herr Rassmussen.
Dear Sir. —I feel it m3' duty to write and tell 3'ou how
your remedies have cured me.
I suffered great agony with WEAK NERVES and
RHEUMATICS, and I sent for some of your ALFALINE
REMEDIES, which completely cured me, and I have felt
as well as I could wish, although it is two rears ago.
I also tried your ALFALINE UNIVERSAL PILLS,
which completely cleared my skin and purified my blood,
and I am now using your ALFALINE HAIR RESTORER,
which has thoroughly cleaned the scalp and made the
hair grow again, and it has gradually turned the hair
from being grey to that of its original color. I have also
recommended your Remedies for a number of different
complaints and I have never known them to fail, hut to
do all that was claimed for them. I have great, pleasure
to recommend these remedies to all sufferers, as I know
they can be depended on.
You are at libertj' to publish this as well as my photo.
Yours truly, C. J. A. NIELSEN.

Dear Sir.—l can truthfully assert that since using your

recommended the Aifaline Remedies to a number of my
constituents, and I will do the same to all whom I hear
complaining of rheumatic attacks. With kind regards,
I have the honor to be, yours truly,

175 Young-street, Annandale, Sydney.
To Herr Rassmussen.
Dear Sir,—Having suffered for some time from a com-
plaint of the liver and kidneys, for which I took medical
advice, with no effect, I one day was fortunate enough to
pick up one of your hooks in the hush. I was thus in-
duced to try your Aifaline Remedies, and their effect was
magical. I have often since recommended them to my
neighbors, all of whom have felt the benefit as well as
myself. I cannot express how glad lamat my recovery,
as several doctors had given me up, as m3' husband can
testify.—Yours truly, (Signed) Mrs. H. SMITH.

Vitadatio:
It is TrOe. It is
WONDROUS GIFT!
BgatitifGl. It is (a^QCiiQe.

M.
What is the secret of the success of Vitadatio in
Melbourne?
ARGUMENT.
The Universal Brotherhood of Man is a meaningless
phrase to the multitude, only a small minority seeking to
grasp the meaning of it.
Federation of a portion of mankind is better under-
stood, for it has come within the region of Practical
Politics ; but even here men are at variance, many for,
some against.
There is, however, a feeling, a sentiment, a force, call
it what you will, which is a very potent factor among
men, acknowledged by all, that is, sympathy, lying
dormant often, until necessity calls it forth. Only those
who have suff red can really sympathise with those who
suffer, only those Who have been healed understand the
joy of health, or the privilege of putting others in the
way of healing.
Are.the Melbournites a foolish people? They hive
been spending, and are spending, thousands of pounds
for Vitadatio. Have they thrown that money away for
something from which they have derived Vm benefit,
something that, has turned out a fraud? No! They are
not foolish enough for that.
ANSWER.
The secret, then, is this. Vitadatio is a genuine remedy
for many diseases. Every man and woman who has been
cured by it have been happy to tell others of it, and so
the ball has been kept rolling, until to-da3', in Melbourne,
thousands thank God they tried
VITADATIO.
Contributed by a Grate-
ful Patient.
“K IND words NEVER DI E.”
“ The difficulty is not that we don’t know a good thing
when we see it, but that somehow we are always looking
the wrong way.”
“ Know' what yOu can work at, and work at it like a
Hercules.”
“ Question not; but lie and labour
Till your goal be won,
Helping every feeble neighbor,
Seeking help from none.
Lite is mostly froth and bubble,
Two things stand alone,
Kii Iness in another’s trouble,
Courage in our own.
VITADATIO comes to you laden with blessing. VTTA-
DATIO is the good thing; don't be prejudiced, don’t look
away from it.
Think of your health.
Think of your home, your family, and vour friends.
VITADATIO will cure you. VITADATIO will work till
the ends of the earth have heard of it. The GREAT
gERBAL REMEDY will be known as the friend of man.
"J}o GOOD, BECAUSE IT IS RIGHT.”
“ A man can do much good, if he cares not who gets the
praise.”
Whilst the fool is proving-that he is right, the wise man
is finding out where he is wrong.
“ Let all the good thou dost to man
A gift be —not a debt ;
And he will more remember thee
The more thou dost forget.”
VITADATIO is one of the most earnest missionaries it
is possible to think of.
Everyone’s body should be the temple of the soul.
VITADATIO aims at perfection in health ; therefore a
truer estimate and value of life.
VITADATIO proclaims a healthy body and a sound
mind.
The wise man investigates ; the fool knows everything,
and frequently egotistically parades his ignorance.
VITADATIO will help every man and woman to be
better.
“pRESS FORWARD!' ’
“ A great many people fail to win success because, from
first to last, they are aimless.
“It is not likely that a man who has no object before
him, vyho follows no bent of his disposition, who is satis-
fied with a contented, unambitious existence, will arrive
anywhere in particular in the end.
“No one can expect to drift to his best—he must work
to it; not that it is necessary that the end should be seen
from the beginning, but there must be an onward move-
ment from purpose to purpose if the full possibilities of
the life of a capable man are to be reached.”
I have taken these few remarks to myself and studied
to make the good of my brothers and sisters my aim.
I have placed Vitadatio before the people with a
purpose ; the good of the beneficiaries will always be my
good.
It is an oft-told tale that thousands have been cured ;
the testimonials, letters, and public utterances of the
saved ones prove it.
Mutual benefits and reciprocity carry our world along
magnificently
Vitadatio has a noble work in front, and the bitter cry
of the agonised rings ever in our ears.
What aims in life can the poor diseased stricken
brother or sister have ? Vitadatio aims at healthy living.
■yTTADATIO is now before THE PEOPLE for over
’ eleven years. It has advanced in a most wonderful
and phenomena! manner. Why? Because it has proved
its claims. Positive Cures of Cancer, Consumption,
Hydatids, Bright’s Disease, Lumbago, Liver, Kidneys,
Biliousness, Dyspepsia, Piles, Debility, Sciatica,
Eczema, Sores, VVastings, all from bad blood, and
VITADATIO is the Blood Purifier of the Age. It is now
candidly conceded to be a wouderful medicine.
rjIRUE REFORM.
“ Nothing of real worth can be achieved without work-
ing- Man owes his growth chiefly to that active stirring
of the will, that encounter with difficulty which we call
effort. Results, apparently impracticable, are often thus
made possible." VITADATIO has encountered and has
overcome many difficulties in the past.
What is the history of all great reforms, and great new
truths and philosophies ? Reformers have in the past had
to fight manfully against superstition, prejudice, ignor-
ance, vested interests, and many hydra-headed monsters.
But still the words keep ringing in our ears : “Fight a
good fight.”
“ Courage, brother, do not stumble,
Though your path be dark as night,
There s a star that guides the humble,
Trust in God and do the right.”
VITADATIO is curing thousands.
Therefore VITADATIO will go on in the good work.
POOLS RUSH ; WISDOM REFLECTS.
“ Fools are the only people who have no doubts about
anything.”
“ It is the mother who moulds the character and fixes
the destiny of the child."
When a man continually sings his own praises, he often
pitches the tune a bit high.
Have you doubts regarding Vitadatio and its efficacy to
cure the many so-called incurable diseases which are ruth-
lessly decimating humanity ? Then reflect, and come and
get the information you desire.
VITADATIO has cured the diseases, and can proudly
point to living witnesses. Read the Testimonials of the
many miraculous cures.
VITADATIO appeals to character and the fair and un-
prejudiced criticism of intelligent men and women.
VITADATIO courts the most searching investigation ;
the wider the inquiry the more satisfactory.
A TRUTH ascertained is a life-pension gained.
- cx Physical perfection begets mental vigor.
When the body is diseased it is because it is full of
diseased, decayed, dead, and useless particles.
Vitadatio throws off these particles, and does it effec-
tually.
Vitadatio is the microbe destroyer; the blood-purifier
of the age.
Look at the magnificent results; the wonderful cures by
Vitadatio.
It has raised them from beds of death. After the doctors
have given them up, Vitadatio has cured.
Look at the cures. They are simply marvellous in their
reach.
Vitadatio has cured incurable diseases. No matter what
it is, bring your trouble to VITADATIO.
! RUTH IS A PEARL.
“A cad is a man you don't want to know." He will
slander those who assisted him. He will, “like the dog
in the manger, turn on the hand that fed him."
Truth will always got to the front, and “ a lying tongue
is an abomination.”
Slanders are the outcome of vile dispositions.
VITADATIO has always maintained the highest reputa-
tion for honesty of purpose, and hence the shafts of
jealousy that are now and again anonymously hurled
at it.
It is like shooting at one of our ironclads with a pea-
gun, or attempt ing the rocks of Gibraltar with a shanghai.
VITADATIO has cured the diseases named, and can
give tangible proof, living witnesses all over the colonies
honestly, truthfully, gratefully and considerately bearing
testimony. Cynics, sceptics, or misanthropes may say
it can’t, but facts speak stronger than words, and
VITADATIO maintains it has. You can't get away front
solid, tangible, reliable facts.
“ A DENIAL.”
PUBLIC NOTICE.
Many shafts of jealousy have been hurled at VITA-
DATIO, all owing to its popularity and widespread
efficacy.
I have repeatedly refuted falsehoods, insinuations, and
general evil-speaking, which have uniformly been traced
to those endeavoring to introduce some preparation of
their own, in fact, plainly rivalry—the old story, “ The
Fox and the Grapes."
Now the latest canard regarding VITADATIO is that it
is “composed of little else than spirit.” This statement
I again leave to proof.
I always like facts.
Professor Black, of the University, Dunedin, New Zea-
land, Government analyist for that colony, certifies that
the alcoholic proportion is 7 per cent., and that certifica-
tion can at any time be confirmed.
I may here remark that every doctor, chemist, or
maker of medicine will bear me out in stating that a per-
centage is necessary for preservation, more especially in
herbal preparations.
I make bold to state that VITADATIO is less in propor-
tion than any other proprietary at present before the
public.
Ladies and gentlemen, the report is simply “ Sour
Grapes.”—Yours faithfully,
S. A. PALMER.
I cannot express the satisfaction I feel when one after
another comes to me restored to health. Do not imagine
that I am under-rating money-considerations. I don’t
wish to be classed as a fool, but I tell you Gratitude and
Money are a strong combination.

Baron Berzelius’ Report.
These Bitters I recommend in DYSPEPSIA, CHRONIC RHEUMATISM and CUTA-
NEOUS AFFECTIONS. The action of Buchu on the human frame is more effectual on all
diseases of the-Kidney and Bladder than any other herbal plant; and it also assists persons suffer-
ing from Skin Diseases, causing a healthy action of the secretions and inducing perspiration.
Head What Medical Men Say About Them .
BJERKIN, M.D. The Bitter is pure, and not like others in overdoses. It has a remark-
able influence, on the Liver, promoting the secretions of Bile, and correcting it when deranged,
and restores healthy evacuations in cases of habitual costiveness.
D. ECKSTROM, M.D. :--BBBB—I find these Bitters a most valuable and wholesome
Tonic, being pure and strengthening; a stimulant to the Liver, assisting Digestion. I therefore
thus recommend them.
G. B. WOOD, M.D. : —lt is the purest of; Bitters, and exerts a peculiar influence over the
Liver. ' ' jh

Two of a Trade.
That two of a trade seldom agree is a common
saying. Its weakness, however, resides in the fact
that it is a cavilling, sneering saying. The idea
sought to be conveyed is that the disagreement is
the outcome of reciprocal jealousy. While that is
likely; it is not a necessary, or even a philosophical,
inference. Two of a trade may easily see reasons
for an honest difference of opinion to which the
outsider is blind. Again, two of a trade may agree
and both be wrong—on a point, of course, con-
nected with their own industry. Some years ago
there was high debate over the question whether a
painting, exhibited in Paris, was an original
Velasquez or a copy. Half the' artists and
connoisseurs in Europe got hot under the collar
about it. It was one or the other —so they said.
Later, on the fact came out. It was neither an
original nor a copy ; it was a replica. The experts
were mistaken. And so runs speculative judgment
in everything.
Here is the case of two doctors ; both, doubtless,
competent men. If they were wrong, or if only
one was wrong—but let us have the story first.
It comes from a reputable source, and is well
corroborated.
“In March, 1891,” says the relater, “I had a
severe attack of influenza, which prostrated me
for two months. After this I could not get up my
strength. My appetite was poor, and what little
I did eat gave roe much pain. at the chest and
around the heart. Sharp, cutting pains in the re-
gion of the heart seized me every now and again,
sometimes so bad I feared I was going to die. At
night I got little or no sleep on account of wind,
which rose into my throat until I fairly gasped
for breath. During the painful attacks of my
complaint perspiration would stand in beads upon
my face.
“ I soon lost strength to that extent I could not
stand. Indeed, I was weak as a child. I was
often so dizzy I had to catch hold of something to
keep me from falling. Several times these attacks
have come upon me at concerts, obliging my friends
to conduct me home. As time passed on I grew
more and more feeble, arid abandoned all hope of
ever being well and strong again.
“ I had two doctors attending me who prescribed
medicines; which, however, eased me only for a
time and then I was as bad as ever.
“ One doctor said I had pleurisy ; the other said
I had heart disease.
“For two and one-half years I lingered along,
nearly as much dead as aliye, all my relatives and
friends thinking I would riot recover. In Novem-
ber, 1893, a book was left at my house in which I
read of a case like mine having been cured by
Mother Seigel’s Syrup. My wife procured me a
bottle from the Provincial Drug Stores in West-
gate-street, and the first bottle gave me so much
relief that I continued with the medicine. I could
then eat well, and the food agreed with me, the
pain around the heart soon ceasing.
“ In a short time my strength returned, and I
got back to my work well and vigorous. Since
then I have been in the best of health.. You are at
liberty to publish this statement and refer to me.”
—(Signed) William Henry Jervis, 48 Rendlesham
Road, All Saints, Ipswich, November 13th, 1897.
One of Mr. Jervis’s doctors pronounced his com-
plaint to be pleurisy; the other said it was heart
disease. Were they both right, or both wrong?
Or was one rig!it and the Other wrong? In the
latter case—which one ? Judging from the symp-
toms as set forth by Mr. Jervis the probability is
that both were right— as far as they went.
The sac or bag which surrounds the heart (called
the pericardium), and the sac in which the lungs
rest (called the pleurae), are parts of the lymphatic
system ; which is the especial abiding place and
stamping ground of the kind of poison, produced
by the diseased digestive system, and the cause of
rheumatism, gout, pleurisy, and heart disease.
Now, after (if not before) his attack of influenza
Mr. Jervis suffered from acute dyspepsia with
torpid liver, which engendered the poison that set
up a mild form of both pleurisy and heart dis-
order. When the real and underlying ailment of
all—the dyspepsia —was cured by Mother Seigel’s
Syrup these supplementary or consequential
troubles vanished, as might be expected.

ESr. THOMAS BARRETT Testifies and Narrates his Troubles
and Recovery.
(by our special reporter.)
For a period of no less than 45 years
Mr. Barrett has been a soldier in the Queen’s
Service ; 10 years in the Imperial Service,
and 25 years in the New South Wales
Artillery. Everyone in military circles
knows Tom Barrett, he is a man of fine
soldierly appearance, and for many years he
has resided at 7 Sliadforth Street, Padding-
ton, having retired with honor from the
service of his Queen. However, he still
looks a young man, and every inch a soldier,
and he assured our reporter, who interviewed
him as to his
Cure by Clements Tonic
of Liver complaint and Indigestion, that he
was still ready to take up arms again in the
event of his services being in request.
“Had you always good health in the
armv ?” asked our reporter.
“ N >, on the contrary I suffered for many
years from a
Disordered Liver,
and a badly impaired digestion. Sometimes
I was very bad, but I never obtained any
permanent relief, and more than once I
thought I should have to retire from the
service.”
“ Would you mind relating how the
trouble first came on ?”
‘ ‘ Certainly. I can hardly explain how it
came on;
It crept upon me
almost imperceptibly. I noticed a headache
first, and a very bitter and unpleasant taste
in the mouth every morning. I didn’t care
whether I ate any breakfast or not, and
instead of feeling bright and vigorous, and
fit to perform my day’s duties, I felt
Dull, Weary, and Depressed,
and did not feel inclined to leave the house
at all. I took no notice of these symptoms,
as I thought I was merely a little out of
sorts, and that a dose of aperient medicine
would put me right, but I was very much
mistaken. I took some medicine, but in-
stead of getting better I was sorry to find I
was getting
Worse Every Cay,
My headaches became more violent, my
nights were almost sleepless, and many
nights, although I was very weary, I re-
mained awake for hours,
Tossing from Side
to side, and trying to find some position in
which I could obtain a little rest. Soon I
was troubled in another direction. Sharp
pains assailed me in the back, just
Between the Shoulders,
and in the side. These pains would often
come on most acutely whilst walking, then
I was obliged to stand still till they mode-
rated. I hadn’t much money to throw
away on doctors, so I went to a chemist, and
on my describing what I felt he said there
was no doubt I was suffering from Liver
Complaint. He gave me some physic, which
I tried-for a week or two, but it did me no
good. He then gave me another sort of
medicine to try, but this was of no more use
'ban the first lot, and I still
Continued to Get Worse.”
“What other symptoms did you suffer
from ?”
“I had many other symptoms as the
disease got a stronger hold upon me. I was
afflicted with
A Strange Trembling.
People would say,‘ Why, what’s the matter,
“knn, what makes you shake so?’
_“ Of course, I couldn’t answer them, fori
jidn’t know myself. Well, then, I began
k> get terrible
Fits of Sickness.
Nothing that I ate agreed with me, and it
was as much as I could do to get any food
to remain on my stomach at all.
Severe Griping Pains
in the boweN came on at times, and I had
long-continued and obstinate fits of con-
stipation, coupled with flatulence. This
was just like a
Ball of Wind
on my chest, and it gave me intense pain.
I became extremely low and weak. The
pains in my back and side were so violent
that I could only move about with the
greatest difficulty, My headaches increased
in
Frequency and Violence.
The whole of my system was thoroughly out
of order. I grew thin and. weak. I was
attended to by
Two or three r oefors,
but although they gave me every attention
their medicines did me no good. As I said
before, I thought my career as a soldier was
over. It was only when I was laid up in
bed that I decided to try Clements Tonic.
I had taken it before, and
Derived Great Benefit,
so I thought I would try it again.
“And you found it a reliable remedy?”
“ Yes, I was quite astonished at the benefit
I received from it after even a few doses.
In five or six days I had
quite got rid
of the fits of vomiting and flatulence. My
appetite picked up, and I felt more
Cheerful and Hopeful
than I had done for months past. My
headaches grew less and
Less every day,
and I slept from 10 o’clock in the evening
till eight in the morning without waking,
consequently I felt correspondingly refreshed
in the mornings. Every day I noticed a
marked improvement. Clements Tonic had
excellent effects upon my digestive organs,
and if I missed but a dose or two I noticed
the difference at once. Probably my liver
was the cause of all the
Various Bad Symptoms
I’ve spoken of, but, under the influence of
Clements Tonic, the pains between the
shoulders slowly went away as my liver
commenced to work properly again. I began
to feel quite a different man, after all the
long
Weariness, heaviness, and
Lassitude
that were always upon me whilst my liver
was not doing its duty. I felt now as
though I was walking on air, the
Change was so Great.”
“And how long did it take you to get
completely well ?”
“ Somewhere about six weeks, I suppose
—that is, my liver and digestion were in
Proper Order again.
However, I still stuck to Clements Tonic
for a time, and. -it soon made me fit and
strong and able to undertake any amount of
work. I always reckon to keep a bottle by
me for emergencies, and if I was going on a
campaign I tell you I would sooner take a
few bottles of Clements Tonic than a whole
medicine chest of drugs.”
“ Do you ever hare any trouble with your
liver now, Mr. Barrett ?”
“No, I never had a touch of the com-
plaint since, though sometimes I’ve felt a
little out of sorts like, I suppose, everyone
does at times. I always found, however, two
or three doses of Clements Tonic set me

him good day.

Cinquevalli.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
Tales of Paul Cinquevalli have been told in many
lands and sundry languages, also with a good deal
of unveracity at times. Some of the earliest of
them seem to have drawn their inspiration from a
business-manager who adapted his details to cir-
cumstances. A “Biographie de Paul Cinque-
valli, ” printed at Lyons in 1882, said that he was
the eldest of three Italian brothers, and had
become a naturalised Anglais in his childhood,
the naturalisation occurring (according to this
ancient chronicle) at “ the little Scottish town of
Hull,” where the “first of English equilibrists”
took an oath of allegiance to the Queen on his
eight-year-old head. As a hero of romance the
juggler started young.
Paul Cinquevalli, the man of nearly forty—he
appears to be many years younger on the stage,
and off the stage too, until you get the lines of his
strong Irish-looking face in a bright sunlight—
tells The Bulletin that he is a Pole by birth, and
his name is well, never mind, he changed it
long ago for the name he will be remembered by.
He thinks he was an instinctive juggler. At
school, in Berlin—his parents came to Berlin
from Poland before he knew a word of his native
language—he would juggle a luncheon sandwich
out of its tin-box and catch it on the closed lid.
One master would call another master’s atten-
tion to the boy’s slate-balancing successes,
and so on, but he had likewise an athletic side
to his character, and it was in the gymnasium
that Paul Cinquevalli met his fate. Although
every German boy can do something on the
horizontal bars, the young Pole was a “star”
performer, whereby hangs his tale. Among
the spectators at a school gymnastic display came
one Cinquevalli, a trapezist, who ran Ins own
show and had a roving eye for new talent. The
artful stranger proposed to take the lad as an
apprentice, and, one way and another, when he
found the parents unapproachable on the subject,
he persuaded Paul to run off with him to Odessa.
At the Russian frontier the passportless runaway
had to be duly accounted for, so he went through
as the son of his custodian, and made his bow to
the public as Paul Cinquevalli. A couple of years
later he met his father in Berlin, and the fatted
calf was slain to do him honor, for on the previous
night old Emperor William had praised his per-
formance, and the newspapers were making a two-
days’ wonder of boy Paul.
All this time, and for a while law/*, Paul Cin-
quevalli was an “serial gymnast” —a liigh-wire
walker and flying trapezeist, with never a net
to catch him if he fell. More often than not he
was in Russia, where the multitude insists upon a
reasonable prospect of bloodshed for its money.
The Russians took kindly to ’ Paul; he did
dangerous feats, and occasionally threw in an
exciting accident, and so they called him the
“ Little Devil, ” with an affectionate emphasis on
the Dev One day, at the Zoological Gar-
dens, St. Petersburg, somebody had been too
drunk to attend to the trapeze fixings, a damp
bar slipped through his fingers, and the
poor Little Devil fell 70 feet—crash. Breastbone
and right leg broken, left arm fractured, and the
wrist reduced to pulp. Cinquevalli illustrates the
story by showing his wrist, disfigured by a callous
lump—a little monument of woe marking the
turning-point in his career. At the hospital
he lay on his back for eight months, and there,
with his undamaged right hand, he began
to juggle the hours away. His latent talent
developed marvellously in that period of tribula-
tion ; he balanced spoons and forks and things
upon his pale countenance, and before he left the
hospital he could see a Future before him.
Soon it was known in St. Petersburg that the
boy who had sustained the sickening thud from
the high trapeze was about to break out in a new
character. On the same platform where he lay
nearly dead ten months before, the convalescent
youth (then about 10) made his reappearance.
The big stage was raised a few feet above the level
of the ground at this same Zoological Garden, and,
as Cinquevalli came forward to juggle, the vast-
ness of the sea of faces in front of him was some-
what too much for his nerves. He had not met
an audience for nearly a year; he was not yet
strong again, and he was now going to test the
business value of his juggling for the first time.
The strange stillness of the crowd chilled
him, and whilst he wondered why he was
getting no reception, Cinquevalli saw the sea of
faces disappear as though by magic. They were
gone —the earth, seemingly, had opened to
swallow them up. In another moment he under-
stood that the first bar of a Thanksgiving Hymn
from the orchestra gave the signal for 10,000
people to drop upon their knees like one docile
Russian and make the sign of the cross,
by way of intimating their pleasure at the
Little Devil’s return. The memory of that
great silent demonstration has remained with
Cinquevalli always. It broke him up at the time
more completely than the accident had broken
him, and there is half a tremor in his voice as he
tells the tale to-day.
Looking at the graceful debonnair cosmopolitan
as he takes the stage at “ Rickards’s, ” it is hard
to realise the fact that the dramatic scene at
Petersburg Zoo happened nearly a quarter of a
century ago. In 187(5 Cinquevalli was a master of
his craft, and between ’76 and ’B5 he made
his mark all over Europe, combining feats
of strength with tricks of balancing, and building
up a celebrity not only for the novel things he did
but also for the incomparable elegance of his work.
Blasd critics in the biggest cities were. his
warmest admirers. Paris perceived the origin-
ality of his methods—the fresh sentiment in his
art of taking pains, as compared with the golden-
ball jugglery of his dull-witted predecessors—and
Paris monopolised his services for six years at a
stretch, but at the end of ’B5 Cinquevalli went to
London under a two-months’ engagement, and
since then he has spent the greater part of
his life in England. The solemn Saturday Review
said of him thirteen years ago in a leading article :
“So novel are many of his feats that we do not
hesitate to say that ho stands on the brink of a
new discovery. The art of jugglery is ready for
some one to renovate it. If Paul Cinquevalli can
work with his head as he works with his hands
he may discover the new jugglery.” He did
discover it, and he went on discovering it, for,
with the exception of his cannon-ball “turn,”
which he has improved upon meanwhile, none of
the tricks he did in ’B6 are included in Cinque-
valli’s present repertoire.
To the list of his patient inventions there has
been no end. The common things that everybody
handles familiarly are the tools of Cinquevalli’s
trade, and much of his charm as an artist is
in his genius for astounding our sense of
the ridiculous. A hat is on his head, a cigar
in his mouth, an umbrella in his hand, a half-
crown screwed into the place where George Reid
carries his eyeglass—and the entertainment was in
juggling those things to their respective destina-
tions. Here is a man pursued by imitators who
have never got near to him. He creates, and they
copy, if they can ; but it is only the original work
which fetches a high price in the world’s market.
Cinquevalli has an optional engagement with
managers in London (the Empire), New York
(Koster and Bial’s), Paris, and Berlin, which
allows him to fix his own time for reappearing at
either place. This four-sided engagement has six
years to run. An entry in his note-book serves to
remind himself to advise the Empire, for instance,
that he will take his turn there again on Easter
Monday next.
Cinquevalli will make no more long sojourns in
one country. He has invented his own disease—
jugglery on the mind—and the doctor’s prescrip-
tion is a sea journey, with its inevitable respite
from “ balancing, ”to be taken twice a year. In
’9B he travelled to South Africa, and back to
London ; this year Australia gets him, on account
of his health. It isn’t the cannon-ball dropping
on his neck that has found him out, or the strain
of such casual feats of strength as the supporting
of a full-sized man on the palm of his hand at
arm’s length whilst he sits before a table with a
book in his other hand; it is the juggle
germ, the eternal incitement to practice, which
troubles him. He can’t comb and brush
his curly hair, like an ordinary being, until
he has juggled with the implements. Before he
cleans his teeth he is disposed to balance the tooth-
brush on his chin. Cinquevalli’s favorite dissipa-
tion is music ; he plays the piano, sackbut, harp,
dulcimer, and all kinds of stringed instruments,
and arranges the orchestral accompaniments to his
stage work. Said to be a wise and interest-
ing discourser on Potentates he has Met, he is
sorry to admit that he speaks many languages, for
if he spoke in only one tongue (says the weary
linguist) he would be spared the conversation of
many fools. By the way, Cinquevalli mentions
that the comic element in his performance is a
comparatively recent addition. About five years
ago he began to be “funny”—to take liberties
with the audience, as he terms it, on discovering
that they liked a little salt with their science, but
up to then he had allowed the humor of his per-
formance to speak for itself. Judging from a little
story of a carbuncle on his neck, Cinquevalli is
naturally a quiet and reserved humorist. The car-
buncle happened in America; it was an awful
trouble to him, and, on arriving at the town of
Providence, he determined to let the cannon-
ball come down on the inflamed pinnacle
of the excrescence. Nobody in the audience or
behind the scenes had heard of his plan. Only
he and the cannon - ball knew what was
going to happen, and the cannon-ball got the best
of the joke, for, in spoiling the carbuncle, it knocked
the owner senseless. Speak to Cinquevalli about
“the ways of Providence,” and you touch him on
what was once a very sore point.
A proposal is afoot to establish an indus-
trial training home for aboriginal men and women
somewhere on the Murray. The site has not yet
been determined, but it will probably be pretty
low down. Daniel Matthews, the most widely-
known missionary among Australian blacks, with
headquarters at Maloga, near Echuca, is behind
the movement.
“Seeing the Last of You.”
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
When you’re going away by boat,” said Mit-
chell, “you ought to say good-bye to the women
at home, and to the chaps at the last pub. I hate
waiting on the wharf or up on deck when the
boat’s behind time. There’s no sense in it, and a
lot of unnecessary misery. Your friends wait on
the wharf and you are kept at the rail to the
bitter end, just when they and you most want a
spell. And why? Some of them hangout because
they love you, and want to see the last of you ;
some because they don’t like you to see them
going away without seeing the last of you ; and
you hang out mostly because it would hurt ’em if
you went below and didn’t give them a chance of
seeing the last of you all the time —and you curse
the boat and wish to God it would start. And
those who love you most —the women-folk of the
family—and who are making all the fuss and
breaking their hearts about having to see the last
of you, and least want to do it, they hang out the
longest and are the most determined to see it.
Where’s the sense in it ? What’s the good of see-
ing the last of you ? How do women manage to
get consolation out of a thing like that ?
“ But women get consolation out of queer
things sometimes,” he added reflectively, “and so
do men.
“ I remember when I was knocking about the
coasts, an old aunt of mine always persisted in
coming down to see the last of me, and bringing
the whole family too—no matter if I was only
going away for a month. I was her favorite. I
always turned up again in a few months, but if
I’d come back every next boat it wouldn’t have
made the slightest difference to her. She’d say
that I mightn’t come back some day, and then
she’d never forgive herself nor the family for not
seeing me off. I suppose she’ll see the end of me
yet if she lives long enough—and she’s a wiry old
lady of the old school. She was old-fashioned
and dressed like a fright, they said at home. They
hated being seen in public with her ; to tell the
truth, I felt a bit ashamed, too, at times. I
wouldn’t be, now. When I’d get her off on to the
wharf I’d be overcome with my feelings, and have
to retire to the privacy of the bar to hide my
emotions till the boat was going. And she’d
stand on the end of the pier and wave her hand-
kerchief and mop her old eyes with it until she
was removed by force.
“ God bless her old heart 1 There wasn’t so
much affection wasted on me at home that I felt
crowded by hers ; and I never lost anything by
her seeing the last of me.
“ I do wish the Oracle would stop that con-
founded fiddle of his —it makes you think over
damned old things.”

A Song of N.S.W. South Coast.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
Oh ! for the plash where the paddles ohum
As the steamers round to Moruya Bar,
And the cow-bells tinkle among the fern
Down the rocky streams where the shadows are ;
Oh ! for the swift Shoalhaven’s song,
As she swings her bends like a bit-less steed,
With the milkers moving her banks along
To their dewlaps deep in the clover feed 1
Oh ! for the mist on the mountain spurs,
And the shining river of shifting sand,
And the golden life that was one day hers—
Araluen, a lovely land !
Oh ! for the blue of Konjola Bay,
Where the little brown boats with their silver
wings
Beat up to the isle where the breakers play
And the ocean-wind in the black-butt sings !
I have stood on the cliff in the fading light
And watched them in Ulladulla Bay,
Setting the lamps in their beacons bright—
’Tis a narrow channel in open day !
On a square of the soft green buffalo-grass
I have watched the liners with dropping leads,
Black streaks of smoke on the sky-line pass
Nor’-nor’-eastward to Sydney Heads !
I have stood by the wash of the creeping tide
Where the blue waves breast on therocksand fall,
Where the porpoises play and the brown weeds ride
On the foam-white steeds that have never a stall;
I have seen the creepers above the fern
To the tall white stems cling purple and red,
And the crimson buds on the coral burn
In the naked boughs when the leaves are dead.
I have climbed to the turn of the Bulli Pass,
And there for an idle hour, well-lost,
I have lain alone in the fern and grass
And feasted my eyes on the fair South Coast;
And looked to the North, where the green-clad
range
Up from the rich green pastures grew ;
And out to the Eastward, mystic, strange,
League upon league of a seaboard blue.
And I love her beauty, this land of mine,
And I love the sheen of her ferny coast,
Her pastures green and her mountain-line—■
But maybe and maybe her ocean most;
Because on the blue there are set no bars,
And a fenceless road is the road o’er seas,
Till we lift the heath on the misty scars
And the bloom on the red, red rowan trees.

Potsherds.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
“ Let the potsherd strive with the potsherds of the
earth. Shall the clay say to him that fashioned it: What
makest thou ? ’’—lsaiah.
A hundred men were salting the ironstone ground
with their sweat. At every heave of the picks,
adzes, or huge hammers, streams of toil rained
from bared elbows, steer-like necks and shaggy
beards. Here and there where a navvy was bare-
footed a wet margin left a grotesque impression of
a human foot whenever the strong man shifted
his position. In their own phraseology “ the
gangers had been knocking hell out of them,”
hence the groups that were within hearing smiled
grimly to hear the boss now “ knocking hell out
of the gangers.”
The ganger last under fire had a three-inch nail
in his mouth* He shifted it from cheek to cheek
and shuffled his feet uneasily, glancing stealthily
at the engineer the while. The pair stood in the
full glare of the Westralian mid-afternoon
win, and though the ganger knew it was 120 in
the shade, here was the engineer shaking under an
overcoat and muffler and directing his volleys
from between chattering teeth. Presently, when
the latter took out a note-book and pencil and
began a calculation, the ganger slid away for a
few yards, then ran at top speed to intercept a
buggy creeping up a rise on the mam track. A
man with a hard, quiet young profile showing
above his khakee collar turned and nodded to the
ganger’s query. “Are you Mr. Currie, the resi-
dent engineer of the next district, sir ? ” and
pulled to a stop the four nuggety horses in the
traces.
“Well,” continued the ganger, “I’m afraid
Mr. More, the boss of this one, is very ill;
he . .
• • • •
Wilfrid Currie got his friend into the buggy
and fixed comfortably under rugs on the back seat.
He had taken the reins from his groom and had
4riven about a mile, as carefully as if he had a
wck girl aboard, when he suddenly swung round
and drove back to the group of navvies.
“Bring a pick and shovel here, will you?” he
shouted to a ganger. It was done, and the tools
put at More’s feet, who kicked them irritably and
asked, “ What do you want with these things ? ”
“For you, of course,” replied Currie, “if you
peg out on the road. Think I’d be content with a
dusting of sand on top of you ? I’m thorough!”
More grunted a disgusted “ Ugh! ” and no
further word was spoken till two hours later, when
they were driving through a patch of dust that had
been a chain of grassy shallow lagoons. Kanga-
roos by the score had come here while the beds of
the drying lagoons were still oozy, and now the
animals lay sunk, too weak to move, in the
hardened earth that held them like cement. Their
fur covered fleshless bones. Many were already
dead. A big doe-kangaroo sat almost upright,
buried above her haunches in the sunbaked mud.
Currie drew the horses aside for fear their hoofs
should strike her, and she glanced up at the man
with a pathetic curiosity, but no fear. Her joey
was dead in her pouch—its little head lolled out
on the mother’s flank. And the mother’s eyes
were abnormally large, and full of wistful patience.
Death was so long acoming. She raised a
trembling fore-paw and brushed some foam from
her gasping lips, still keeping her piteous gaze on
the men.
“ Currie, did you see her ? ”
“ Ay. Look at those horses yonder. You
might hang your hat on twenty places on any one
of them.”
But the doe, Bill; how much longer do you
think she’ll live ? ”
“ Oh, three or four days.”
There was a long silence, and when it was
broken it was by More’s sobs, Currie glanced over
his shoulder, and said softly harsh words.
“ And all for want of a little rain, Bill! But
what can dumb things expect, when we . . . born
to struggle and then to die . . . What is the
reason in sowing the seed ...”
“ Hold your tongue, you—you potsherd ! ”
“ lhe look in that doe’s eyes will follow me
under the hospital canvas and under the sod.”
“ More, haven’t you a wife ? ”
“ Yes, Bill, and two baby girls. The wife is
twenty-t wo years old. She has eyes like that doe.
Do you think she will have more mercy shown her
when I am gone ? ”
Without answering, Currie swung his team
round and galloped back among the mud-bound
kangaroos.
“Stroke her head, Bill,’’said More, “before you
do it. Let her know it’s done for love, and not
for love of killing.”
lie spoke thickly from the folds of a rug, and
did not see Currie pat the kangaroo’s cheek ere he
put a bullet in the back of her brain.
* » * •
Wilfrid Currie sat in his hessian house, with a
half-finished map of his district before him and a
fox-terrier on his knee. At intervals he would
take up a drawing-pen, grip his pipe hard with his
teeth, bend determinedly over the delicate trac-
ings, then blow smoke in the terrier’s face, and
wait in tense expectancy for news of More’s
state.
Through the open door he could see nothing
but cloud-squadrons rushing east before the dry
wind. He could hear naught but the flapping of
the canvas flies over the hospital tents. More
had been ten days in hospital. His wife was on
her way up to him, and Currie had sent his buggy
and horses and a body-guard of three old gangers
80 miles to meet her at the end of a truck line.
Twice or thrice during his waiting the thought
that he would have evil news for the lady caused
him to mutter “Potsherds, potsherds !” then he
would pour something from a stone bottle and
drink.
The doctor came in and dropped on to the
engineer’s bed, which was a stretcher covered
with an old opossum-rug and a blue, satin-covered,
lace-trimmed pillow. The lady who gave him
that cover had intended it as a “sham,” but to
Currie it had been a reality. The doctor had
come up to this district, six months before,
a _ robust young athlete. Now Currie watched
him for a minute, then remarked, “ 1 never saw
anyone look so dog-poor as you. ”
“It is difficult,” yawned the doctor, “ to retain
one’s weight and beauty with two fever-camps on
one s hands and an average of two hours’ sleep a
night. You’re no Apollo Belvedere yourself.”
“ I brought Greye 400 miles at my own expense
so that you might have an eight-hour night’s
sleep—eight hours —a hog couldn’t ask more.
Greye arrived yesterday, so what were you up to
last night ? ”
“ Attending to Greye principally. He had
delirium tremens, and thought himself Mary’s
little lamb. Tried to frisk on to the patients’
beds, and followed me all round the room on his
hands and knees, bleating, and talking of his
snow-white fleece.”
Currie had cold eyes set in deep orbits. They
blazed into sudden wrath, and he spake certain
truths of Greye, who was a freshly-minted doctor,
and asked if he was well enough to be kicked out
of camp at once.
“ He’s sleeping yet. Gave him a strong dose
and put him into North’s hessian humpy. There
was a notice on the door: ‘ Gone East—J. North.’
So I took the liberty.”
“More going on well? ”
“Yes. To-night will see him out of danger.
But he was near going out in a box. I’ll sit up
to-night with him. It would make me savage as
a meat-axe to have him slip away now.”
“I’ll stay up with you, old man. Yes? Who
is it?. Come in ! Are you waiting for a ring-
tailed invitation ? ”
There was a clatter of voices, a burst of laugh-
ter, and three men entered and fell upon the
resident engineer and the doctor in greeting.
One of the new-comers was the manager of the
Queen of Beauty mine. He was extremely plain-
faced, yet his real name was almost lost to memory
so generally was he known as “ Queen of Beauty.”
He found some grapes in a billy, and fell to eating
them, and talking typhoid to the doctor.
Another was a handsome youth named North,
who could flaunt much academic paper, but who
would have considered himself fortunate if he
could have employed the Chinese laundryman to
do his washing, instead of doing it himself. The
third arrival was a colleague of Currie’s, who had
come up on most important business, which, at
the sight of the map, he straightway forgot, and
started to curse the Government.
“ Who’s that varlet you’ve shoved into my
house ? ” demanded North. “ I don’t take lodgers.
Queen of Beauty, you’re eating those grapes like a
commercial traveller. Greye—oh, that fellow !
If you’d consulted me, Currie, I could have told
you that Greye was just the kind of man who,
when he got 14 whiskies down his neck, wouldn’t
care a damn which horse won the boat-race, let
alone how many patients he kills.”
“ This is the driest country I’ve ever been in,”
mused the mine-manager, “ and this is the driest
tent in it.”
Currie sprang to his feet and produced bottles.
“ Here’s the whisky,” he said, “and bread and
cheese. I can’t find a knife —can you break the
bread ? Is the cheese-scoop over there, North ?
Well, make-shift with the shoe-horn, will you ?
Get up, doctor, and line your kidneys.”
“Can you give me a shake-down to-night,
Currie?” asked the mine-manager. “There’s
nothing left of my house except the roof. While
I was in Perth the goats ate every scrap of the
hessian they could reach on their hind legs. And
you know what a pretty house it was—colored
light blue with a white ceiling.”
“ It’s hard on you,” replied Currie. “Of course
you can camp here. I’m sorry North’s humpy
isn’t available. North, what fetched you back
here ? Thought you’d gone East for a holiday.”
“ I started with the intention, but when I got
down to the truck-line I fell in with a prospecting
crowd going out-back. I put my money in. We
had nine horses, and there was a mouth-organ
among the stores.”
“ Did you find anything ? ”
“ Not even the horses. The whole pack broke
away one night when we were seventy miles on
the track, and made for the ranges. It would be
a worthless chase, and we didn’t like to take the
risk.”
“ Did you tramp back ? ”
~ Yes ' But . f was m splendid nick. Nothing
the matter with me but two bung eyes and a
touch of Bareoo. And nothing to carry but a
what’s n and a Blab ° f r ° tten dam P er -
The fire-signal. A gong-like sound—a tin dish
being struck with a billet of wood —was heard
above the high wind. The one movement sufficed
to bring the men to their feet and land them
without the house. A glance at the hospital
canvas showed it safe, and they were racing over
the heavy sand, the doctor leading.
h lames were licking up the hessian settlement
as it it were dry pampas-grass, and sweeping on
to the group of dwellings, of which North’s was
one. A billow of fire swooped upon the two
tents adjacent to that in which Greye lay, and
swept them from sight.
back, doctor; come back!” shouted
the friends, even as they strove to follow him.
I drugged him and put him in there. I must
save him.”
. He dashed into the hessian at the very instant
that long red arms took the thing in a fiery em-
brace.
“ One is enough ! ” muttered the mine-manager,
as he dragged Currie back. Then the four friends
saw the fifth through a wall of fire as plainly as
you may see fish stirring in a glass tank. Saw him
turn and stagger back to where the door had been
firelocked now—after over-turning the empty
* er ? saw the blind groping of arms ere he
fell back into the folds of his red winding-sheet.
* * * *
By time-measurement, the sacrifice was offered
in less than 20 seconds, but four men roused
themselves from what seemed a life-long dream of
horror. Currie was faee-downwards on the sand,
his hands clasped behind his neck, pressing his
eyes into the earth and muttering:
“Oh, living God! Why him?”
Again and again he muttered his de profundis,
until a cry and the mention of a name brought
uppermost something primordial in the man. He
rose to fasten his steel-like fingers in Greye’s
throat. Greye, who had come amongst them
smiling vaguely and stuttering—and, after the
terrible grip was loosened, men whispered that
the engineer’s teeth had also been in his enemy’s
throat.
* • * *
A nurse, a wardsman, and the distracted dis-
penser stood round More’s cot, but their limited
knowledge availed nothing. More died at day-
break, and over him and the man who could have
saved him Currie read the burial-service some
hours later.
* * * *
‘ The lady has come, sir. I’ve shown her into
your tent. She doesn’t know yet.”
Currie, cold, hard and quiet' as his wont, had
been watching the cloud of dust that heralded the
arrival of the buggy and of More’s widow. He
nodded to his groom’s announcement, his grave
eyes in their sunken orbits quailed for a second,
his dry lips parted that he might say : “ I would
eat ashes for the rest of my days rather than have
this news for her.”
He pushed the hessian door open, paused, then
bared his head, and stepped within.

** lam anxious to obtain all the prizes and honors possible. To do this I
know I must keep my blood and system in good order. For this purpose I
tried Ayer’s Sarsaparilla and the results have always been satisfactory.
“Training and racing make an excessive nervous strain and loss of nerve
force and physical strength. To quickly restore this loss of nerve energy' and
power I have never found anything equal to Ayer’s Sarsaparilla. The Sarsa-
parilla keeps my blood pure and this tones up and strengthens my whole body.
“Today I have the honor to be the champion cyclist of Forbes, thanks to
your wonderful medicine. I send you my portrait on my good steed that has
carried me with waving colors over the track.”
This is the testimony and portrait of the well-known cyclist, H. H. John-
son, of South Forbes, New South Wales.
Ayer’s Sarsaparilla takes out all impurities from the blood. It changes
thin blood into rich, red blood, such blood as healthy nerves and muscles must
have. “Ayer’s ” and only Ayer’s is called
"The World’s Greatest Family Medicine.”
All who are thin and pale need it. All who are weak and easily tired need,
it. All who are nervously depressed from a warm climate need it.
